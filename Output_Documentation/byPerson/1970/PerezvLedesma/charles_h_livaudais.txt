mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
honorable
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
is
that
it?
this
is
a
case
also
involving
obscenity,
is
involving
the
criminal
prosecution
of
appellee
ledesma
in
this
case
both
for
the
sale
of
obscene
publications
and
the
possession
of
obscene
publications
with
the
intent
to
sell.
the
primary
issue
in
this
appeal
raised
on
appeal
is
a
procedural
question
in
enforcing
a
state
statute
and
the
question
as
post
to
the
court
is
whether
or
not
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution
under
a
valid
and
constitutional
state
statute
which
has
been
filed
constitutional
by
the
three-judge
court
relative
to
sale
and
possession
with
intent
to
sale
obscene
materials
and
publications.
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
a
judicial
adversary
hearing
prior
to
the
arrest
and
prosecution
of
the
defendant
to
determine
in
advance
of
his
arrest
or
prosecution
whether
or
not
the
materials
and
publications
involved
are
obscene
under
the
terms
of
the
state
statute.
we
will
have
other
related
issues
which
i
will
cover
in
connection
with
this
in
reference
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
on
appeal
in
light
28
u.s.c.
1253
in
the
gunn
case
which
has
been
discussed.
we
also
have
problems
connected
involving
injunctions
and
declaratory
judgments
under
2283
which
has
also
been
discussed
and
intervention
by
federal
courts
and
state
proceedings
and
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
this
case
originated
on
january
27th
of
1969
when
two
deputies
of
the
st.
bernard
parish
sheriff's
office
and
the
state
of
louisiana
purchased
four
obscene
publications
from
ledesma
at
his
store
in
st.
bernard
parish
in
arabi,
louisiana.
these
publications
and
the
other
publication
i
required
to
are
here
with
the
record
which
i
brought
in
filing
with
this
court.
ledesma
was
arrested
and
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
these
deputies
selected
certain
publications,
the
three-judge
court
found
it
to
be
the
number
45
from
his
shelves
as
evidence.
four
bills
of
information
were
filed
against
him
by
me
in
the
state
court,
two
of
them
under
the
state
statute
relative
to
sale
and
possession
with
intent
to
sell
obscene
publications,
and
two
almost
identical
bills
of
information
under
the
parish
ordinance.
these
two
charges
under
the
parish
ordinance
which
were
almost
identical
to
the
state
ordinance
were
subsequently
now
crossed
or
dropped
by
me.
now
in
this
prosecution
in
the
state
court,
ledesma
was
afforded
an
adversary
judicial
hearing
focusing
on
the
obscenity
of
these
publications
in
the
form
of
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
which
he
filed
under
state
prosecutions.
the
basis,
one
allegation
was
that
our
statute
was
vague
and
overbroad
and
the
other
was
that
the
materials
were
not
obscene.
this
was
decided
within
two
weeks
after
his
arrest,
he
had
his
hearing
in
state
court
and
we
tried
this
issue
and
the
state
judge
denied
the
motions
of
ledesma.
wanting
another
bite
at
the
apple,
he
then
went
to
federal
court
to
ask
the
federal
court
for
relief
under
the
civil
rights
statute
asking
to
declare
both
our
state
statute
and
our
parish
ordinance
unconstitutional
for
vagueness
and
overbroad.
also
asking
for
injunctions
against
pending
and
state
--
and
future
state
prosecutions
and
also
asking
that
we
be
enjoined
from
retaining
the
publication
in
our
possession
and
using
them
at
prosecutions.
also,
he
asked
for
damages
in
the
sum
of
$30,000.00
each
for
his
clients.
after
a
long
and
prolonged
hearing
in
the
court,
not
in
court
but
the
proceeding
in
the
district
court
after
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
on
july
14th
of
1969,
some
five
to
six
months
after
the
arrest,
the
three-judge
court
in
a
two-to-one
decision
with
judge
rubin
dissenting
held
first
all
that
our
state
statute,
the
two
provisions,
subsections
2
and
3
involved
herein
were
held
to
be
constitutional.
judge
rubin
concurred
in
that.
the
court
in
its
order
had
stated
and
i
say
they
alleged
that
they
denied
to
grant
the
injunctive
relief,
grant,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
say
we
specifically
deny
injunctive
relief.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
your
honor,
i'll
get
to
that
but
my
opinion
and
i
think
this
court
will
see
that
we
were
enjoined
both
pending
and
future
prosecutions
were
enjoined
in
this
case.
that
the
court
ordered
its
judgment
in
this
way
so
as
to
get
around
the
provisions
or
article
2283
and
this
court
and
other
cases
which
i
will
give
to
the
court
shortly
look
through
this
particular
type
of
action
by
a
court
where
it
tried
to
evade
2283,
and
actually
had
an
order
which
had
practical
effect,
the
operating
effect
of
an
injunction
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
unless
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
was
deferred
to
hearing
on
the
merits
today.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that
is
right
your
honor.
that
is
the
way
i
construe
the
judgment
of
the
court.
in
the
record
–
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
oh!
that
is
a
common
practice,
your
honor
and
one
that
i
do
not
think
as
advisable
for
a
district
court
to
take
like
that
article
65
subsection
c
of
the
federal
rule
of
the
civil
procedure
is
a
mandate
to
federal
district
courts
especially
the
three-judge
court
that
when
they
are
dealing
in
the
area
of
injunctions
as
was
stated
in
the
footnotes
to
the
gunn
case
by
this
court,
that
they
should
be
specific,
that
it
is
in
effect
unfair
for
them
to
deal
with
areas
such
as
this
and
not
deal
with
them
in
a
clear
manner
so
that
their
intention
is
obvious
to
the
parties,
that
was
the
problem
in
the
gunn
case.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
as
opposed
to
other
cases
i've
been
arguing.
we
did
not
agree
to
stop
our
prosecution.
the
record
shows
that
first
of
all,
our
case
was
set
for
trial
in
february
of
1969,
the
record
does
not
show
that
but
a
note
of
evidence
is
a
result
of
a
conference
with
judge
boyle
in
this
case
shows
that
our
case
was
first
set,
again
set
the
trial
on
april
21st
of
1969,
that
is
in
the
record
at
page
1,
page
97
i
think,
my
co-counsel
filed
that.
also,
that
was
continued
to
that
date
to
give
this
three-judge
court
time
to
issue
its
decision
which
it
had
not
done
as
of
that
time.
it
was
continued
to
april
28
of
1969.
it
was
again
continued
by
me
after
a
phone
call
from
the
district
judge
stating
that
the
decision
by
this
three-judge
court
would
be
rendered
in
the
near
future
and
that
we
would
be
able
to
take
whatever
action
we
had
to
after
that.
so
we
did
not
abide
by
any
request.
we
did
not
concede
to
this
court
that
they,
that
we
would
have
to
hold
our
prosecution
prior
to
their
decision.
now,
in
their
decision
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
i
was,
our
order
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that's
right.
they
ordered
us
to
return
all
the
materials
instanter,
instantly
from
this
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
i
would
say
it
is,
your
honor
in
connection
with
the
wording
in
the
judgment
itself
which
said
i
quote
“that
the
pending
prosecutions
should
be
effectively
terminated.”
that
was
the
wording
of
the
judgment
at
page
97
in
the
appendix
to
this
record.
the
pending
prosecution
should
be
effectively
terminated,
now
whether
they
say
should
be
enjoined
or
effectively
terminated,
it
has
the
same
meaning
as
our
contention
that
we
were
enjoined
and
that
this
order
ordering
us
to
give
up
or
evidence
to
return
it
instanter
and
also
to
suppress
it
in
any
prosecutions
that
both
pending
and
future
is
--
has
all
the
practical
and
full
force
and
operative
effect
of
an
injunction
upon
us.
what
better
way
to
stop
our
prosecution
than
to
take
our
evidence
away
from
us
or
to
tell
us
that
we
will
--
we're
not
in
good
faith
continued
prosecutions
or
to
say
that
the
prosecution
should
be
effectively
terminated?
and
your
honor,
there
is
a
case
that
is
not
in
my
brief,
i
wish
to
cite
it
at
the
court,
at
this,
to
the
court
at
this
time
in
connection
with
the
gunn
case
which
came
out
after
my
brief
is
at
the
premise
international
longshoremen's
association
versus
philadelphia
marine
trade
association,
found
at
389
u.s.
64.
in
that
case,
there
was
an
order,
an
arbitration
--
an
arbitration
award
and
a
labor
dispute.
it
was
not
before
the
court
but
then
after
dispute
arose
over
the
arbitration
order,
the
union
went
in
the
court
and
they
asked
the
court
to
give
an
order
and
the
court
gave
this
order,
i
quote,
“that
the
arbitration
award
be
specifically
enforced
and
then
he
went
on
out
of
the
union
to
comply
with
and
abide
with
the
award.”
and
on
the
appeal
to
this
court,
even
though
the
word
injunction
was
not
used,
your
honors
held
that
and
i
quote,
“whether
or
not
the
district
court's
order
was
an
injunction,
it
was
an
equitable
decree,
compelling
obedience
under
the
threat
of
contempt
and
was
therefore
an
order
granting
an
injunction.”
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
sir
that
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
look
at
the
ledesma's
petition,
both
his
original
petition
and
his
amended
petition,
his
prayer
asked
for
injunctive
relief
to
keep
us
from
retaining
the
books
in
our
possession,
that
was
his
request
and
that
is
what
he
got.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
the
injunction
that
he
has
for.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes
your
honor
they
did,
it
was
instanter,
the
only
way
i
could
stop
that
order
was
to
get
a
stay
order
pending
the
appeal
to
this
court
and
that
is
one
of
the
reason
why
the
books
are
here
before
this
court
at
this
time.
i've
transmitted
the
books
here.
they
have
been
introduced
in
evidence
in
this
prior
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court.
so
your
honor,
in
light
of
the
gunn
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
--
in
which
actually
the
word
“injunction”
was
used
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
an
injunction
on
this
labor
in
a
match
on
longshoreman's
case
where
the
word
“injunction”
was
not
used
but
this
court
looked
through
the
attempts
of
the
court
to
evade
the
issue
of
2283
and
actually
issue
an
injunction
even
though
2283
says
it
cannot.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
and
that's
what
we
have
a
right
of
appeal
from.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that's
the
holding
in
that
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
right
and
just
the
converse
is
true
in
our
case.
it
is
crystal
clear
from
the
decision
who
was
enjoined,
perez
(inaudible)
enjoin.
what
is
enjoined?
prosecution
pending
and
future
under
title
14-106
subsections
2
and
3,
this
is
all
right
in
the
opinion
at
page
97
and
the
prior
pages
and
the
opinion
of
the
court.
what
was
enjoined?
these
pending
and
future
prosecutions
and
arrests.
so
i
think
that
this
complies
with
rule
65
(c).
the
only
abuse
of
discretion
violated
here
by
the
three-judge
court
was
deliberately
making
it
look
like
they
were
not
enjoining
us.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes
your
honor,
and
the
object
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
and
the
operative
effect
of
the
order
read
in
light
with
their
opinion.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
and
also
in
the,
another
case
in
which
this,
your
honors
did
the
same
type
of
action,
atlantic
coast
line
case
which
also
was
decided
on
june
of
this
year.
your
honors
also
looked
at
the
order
in
that
case.
the
order
ordered
the
railroad
not
to
take
advantage
of
the
state
court
prosecution.
and
your
honors,
in
that
you
used
the
word
“evade”
so
that
district
three-judge
court
cannot
evade
the
mandate
of
2283
by
enjoining
the
railroad,
will
look
right
through
that
and
see
that
actually
you
are
enjoining
a
pending
state
prosecution.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
right.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
(inaudible)
because
jurisdiction
was
deferred
by
your
honors'
two
argument
today.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
which
i
was
just
arguing
the
case
completely.
i
think
that
would
show
and
not
just
a
prosecution
but
the
retaining
of
the
evidence
and
the
orders
of
the
court.
now,
the
sole
reason
again,
looking
at
the
decision
of
the
court,
the
sole
reason
for
the
entire
decision
of
this
court
can
be
seen
both
in
the
judgment
and
the
footnotes,
appendix
96
and
97
was
that
this
court
felt
that
there
must
be
a
prior
judicial
adversary
hearing
in
this
case.
that
is
a
sole
reason
for
doing
what
they
did
and
they
so
stated.
this
is
a
concept
that
they
derived
from
the
marcus
case
and
a
quantity
of
books
case
which
cases
which
are
referred
to
in
my
brief.
i
wish
to
point
out
again
to
the
court
this
time
that
we
did
have
in
this
case
an
adversary
judicial
determination
of
obscenity,
obscenity.
there
was
a
hearing
in
court
on
the
ledesma's
motion
to
quash
and
motion
to
suppress,
wherein
the
district
court
did
view
the
books
and
made
its
determination.
he
did
have
an
adversary
judicial
determination.
the
only
thing
new
being
requested
is
that
this
be
a
prior
hearing.
that
this
adversary
hearing
be
held
before
any
arrest
or
any
prosecution
of
the
defendant,
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
court
your
honors
have
never
held
that
in
a
criminal
prosecution
that
this
is
necessary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
have
indicated
your
preference
for
the
conventional
course
of
criminal
procedure
in
enforcing
this
cases,
not
to
say
that
other
methods
cannot
be
used
but
i
think
that
in
these
decisions,
francis
and
the
kingsley
books
case,
they
are
where
new
york
attempted
to
supplement
its
conventional
coarse
of
criminal
procedure
in
dealing
with
these
cases.
the
problem
with
the
court
at
that
time
was
that
you
were
hesitant
to
allow
them
to
supplement
their
procedures
and
throughout
the
cases,
roth
case,
albert's
case
which
i
have
quote
in
my
brief
there,
your
honors
indicated
that
such
a
hearing
was
not
necessary
by
its
light.
but
in
the
new
york
feed
case
and
milky
way
cases
which
were
to
decided
in
february
of
1970
by
your
honors,
you
summarily
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
which
held
affirmatively
that
this
adversary
judicial
determination
of
obscenity
was
indeed
a
novelty,
was
unnecessary,
and
afforded
no
special
protection
to
the
books
taking
time
cognizance
of
the
concurring
opinion
of
chief
justice
warren
in
the
roth
case,
that
in
these
cases
involving
criminal
prosecutions,
it
is
the
person
who
is
on
trial,
not
the
books.
that
decision
was
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court
and
as
seen
in
the
record
page
121
of
the
appendix,
after
your
honors
came
out
with
your
summary
affirmation
of
the
new
york
feed
and
milky
way
cases.
i
went
back
to
our
three-judge
panel
and
i
told
them
in
my
motion
which
is
in
the
record
here
that
the
supreme
court
has
finally
decided
this
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
must
be
a
prior
adversary
hearing
in
criminal
prosecutions
and
i
filed
the
motion,
we
argued
the
case,
submitted
memorandums
and
the
motion
was
denied
and
i
submit
that
this
number
one
is
proof
of
the
injunctive
intent
of
the
lower
court
and
also,
your
honor
i
feel
that
in
this
case,
we
are
asking
you
to
take
jurisdiction
and
to
decide
these
issues
because
obviously
from
the
action
of
the
three-judge
court
in
our
case
is
summary
affirmation
by
your
honors,
is
not
enough
to
straighten
out
them
arrest
that
has
resulted
in
three-judge
district
in
this
area,
and
we
must
have
a
pronouncement
from
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
this
type
of
hearing
is
necessary,
and
that
is
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
at
this
time.
we
also
fear
your
honor
that
we
do
have
a
question
argue
in
the
other
cases
before
us,
article
2283,
the
abstention
doctrine
in
view
of
dombrowski,
cameron
and
the
atlantic
coast
cases
and
we
just
wish
to
point
out
strongly
in
line
with
that
that
there
was
no
finding
of
bad
faith
on
our
part
in
this
case.
there
was
specific
finding
of
good
faith
on
our
part
and
the
cameron
case
read
together
with
dombrowski,
the
atlantic
coast
cases
are
specific,
that
before
this
three-judge
courts
can
interpose
themselves
in
place
of
the
united
state
supreme
court
in
state
prosecutions,
that
there
must
be
bad
faith
prosecution,
there
must
be
a
statute
which
is
filed
unconstitutional.
in
our
case,
the
court
specifically
found
that
the
sections
of
our
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
are
constitutional.
now,
the
court
also
abused
its
discretion
in
ordering
us
to
return
these
books
and
in
not
invoking
the
adoption
of
abstention,
and
i
argued
this
in
connection
with
the
court's
action
in
declaring
our
parish
ordinance
unconstitutional.
our
reference
to
our
parish
ordinance
your
honor,
there
was
no
case,
there
was
no
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
action
taken
by
the
course
--
by
the
court.
and
golden
v.
zwickler
which
was
a
clarification
of
zwickler
v.
koota,
this
court
held
that
although
the
court
might
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
declaratory
judgments
where
there's
allegations
of
a
controversy
in
the
absence
of
an
actual
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality,
the
court
should
not
make
declaratory
judgments
in
an
advisory
capacity
only.
the
purpose
of
this
being
obviously
to
keep
the
three-judge
courts
from
taking
the
prerogative
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
issue
these
doctrines
especially
in
this
case
of
obscenity
which
is
so
critical
to
our
whole
procedure
in
prosecuting
these
cases
in
court.
one
obvious
result
that
we
can
see
from
the
three-judge
court's
stepping
into
these
cases
is
the
fact
to
state
in
the
previous
case,
“i
am
curious
yellow”
involving
that,
that
there
are
five
other
cases
pending
in
federal
district
three-judge
courts
involving
the
same
issues
and
its
my
intention
that
if
these
cases
were
allowed
to
go
through
the
normal
course
of
procedure
as
stated
in
the
atlantic
coast
case,
that
we
would
not
have
a
confusion
that
we
have
today
in
this
field
of
obscenity.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
noon
recess,
i'd
--
all
practical
purposes
concluded
the
bulk
of
my
argument.
this
time
i
would
like
to
sum
up
where
i
consider
the
major
points
in
my
argument.
one
is
the
jurisdiction
of
question
which
i
think
that
we
have
answered
clearly
as
far
as
the
injunctive
intent
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case.
also,
the
fact
that
in
cases
involving
criminal
prosecutions
that
there
are
adversary
judicial
hearings,
and
that
in
light
of
this
court's
summary
affirmation
of
the
milky
way
and
new
york
feed
cases,
that
there
is
no
need
to
have
this
hearing
prior
to
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
in
the
case.
at
this,
in
effect
we
give
no
more
protection
to
the
publications
than
having
the
hearing
after
the
arrest.
at
this
extraordinary
protection
which
is
not
allowed
in
federal
law
would
serve
to
help
the
lawbreaker.
it
would
not
have
any
further
effect
in
securing
first
amendment
rights.
we
do
feel
that
there
has
been
a
definite
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion
under
the
provision
and
the
mandates
of
article
2283
and
of
the
dictates
of
this
court
and
the
dombrowski
case,
the
cameron
case
and
the
atlantic
coast
case.
in
our
case,
where
there
has
been
no
finding
of
bad
faith
of
any
kind
by
the
lower
court.
our
state
statute
of
sections
2
and
3,
which
are
the
only
ones
before
this
court
today
have
been
held
constitutional
and
that
there
has
been
no
appeal
taken
from
this
decision
of
the
court
by
appellees
in
this
case.
we
further
feel
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
that
the
doctrine
of
abstention
should
have
been
invoked
in
this
case
in
reference
to
the
three-judge
courts
declaring
our
st.
bernard
parish
police
jury
ordinance
unconstitutional.
i
based
that
on
the
finding
not
in
zwickler
v.
koota
which
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
and
previous
argument
erroneously
i
think,
but
in
the
case
of
golden
v.
zwickler
which
enlarged
this
court's
viewpoints
in
zwickler
v.
koota
and
which
this
court
specifically
held
referring
to
zwickler
v.
koota
from
which
it
originated,
that
there
must
be
a
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality.
there
was
no
such
issue
before
the
three-judge
court
in
our
case
and
that
there
were
no
pending
prosecutions
under
that
ordinance
and
there
were
no,
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecutions
had
been
terminated,
there
were
no
threats
of
any
future
prosecutions
under
that
ordinance.
so
here,
we
have
a
case
of
clear
abuse
by
three-judge
court
under
the
provisions
of
2283
by
interfering
with
state
court
prosecutions
and
going
even
further
than
that
and
legislating
criminal
procedure
for
a
state
court.
i
think
that
in
doing
this,
that
this
federal
three-judge
--
that
this
court
has
abused
its
power
and
you
serve
the
powers
of
this
court
in
deciding
louisiana
law.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
first
like
to
comment
on
the
dial
case
which
has
been
mentioned
in
requisite
of
jurisdiction
of
question.
that
case
was
decided
by
this
court,
the
jurisdiction
was
declined
on
the
same
day
that
your
honors
referred
our
case
to
an
argument
on
the
merits.
i'm
sure
you
saw
the
distinction
in
that
case
as
i
see
between
that
case
and
our
case
and
that
is
on
the
dial
case,
the
court
recognized
that
this
case
involves
only
one
contested
issue
of
law,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
an
adversary
hearing
to
determine
the
question
of
obscenity,
must
be
held
prior
to
the
arrest.
now,
that
was
submitted
by
stipulation
of
the
parties
to
the
court,
strictly
for
the
court
to
decide
that
issue.
there
was
no
pending
prosecution,
there
was
not
even
a
threat
of
future
prosecution
but
this
dial
case
amounts
to
is
a
submission
by
both
sides
for
declaratory
judgment
in
that
case
and
i
appeal
that
that
must
be
what
this
court
recognize
when
it
declines
jurisdiction
in
that
case.
there
was
no
pending
prosecution,
no
treats,
no
issue
other
than
the
one
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
prior
adversary
hearing
is
necessary.
that
was
the
sole
issue
in
the
dial
case
and
what
i
have
just
quoted
to
you
is
from
the
report
and
303
federal
supplement
436
at
page
438.
so
there
is
an
easy
distinction
between
the
dial
case
and
our
case,
well,
this
was
a
contested
case
whether
questions
of
constitutionality
of
our
statute,
there
were
questions
of
bad
faith
and
unfortunately
the
statute
and
this
is
an
easy
distinction
to
make.
there
have
been
some
comments
made
by
counsel
concerning
not
either
using
the
word
“threats”
i
don't
think
but
something
akin
to
that
by
the
police
officers
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
in
the
finding
of
the
district
court
after
a
hearing
on
this
case,
they
wanted
to
hear
an
affidavit
so
we
heard
it
on
affidavit
but
we
did
submit
affidavits,
they
found
no
bad
faith,
they
found
no
threats,
they
found
no
bad
faith
at
all
in
our
part.
their
decision
was
made
strictly
on
this
question
of
the
adversary
hearing
which
is
an
erroneous
decision.
this
case
--
this
issue
has
been
settled
by
this
court
and
the
new
york
feed
and
milky
way
cases
which
asked
the
specific
question
and
this
court
affirmed
that
decision.
this
time
we're
asking
the
court
to
reaffirm
that
decision,
your
decision
in
the
milky
way
and
new
york
cases
using
your
own
words
that
once
and
for
all,
these
three-judge
courts
will
understand
what
your
honors
are
telling
them.
this
is
the
problem
that
happens
when
we
have
so
many
federal
three-judge
courts
interfering
with
state
prosecutions,
each
one
of
them
giving
their
own
pronouncement
and
they
are
so
different.
it
has
caused
great
confusion
in
the
law
and
a
lot
of
confusion
as
to
field
of
obscenity
has
been
caused
not
by
your
honors
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
but
by
the
three-judge
courts
that
have
so
many
varying
opinions
as
to
what
should
be
the
law
of
the
land
in
its
area.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes
your
honor,
both.
i
say
that
in
this
case,
in
this
particular
instance
concerning
prior
adversary
hearing,
your
honors
have
spoken
out
on
this.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
in
the
new
york
feed
and
milky
way
cases.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
the
evidence
of
the
entire
overall
problem
of
the
three-judge
courts
making
pronouncements
that
really
should
be
made
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
have
been
made,
have
been
made
but
unfortunately,
in
that
case
was
a
summary
affirmation.
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
i
couldn't
sell
our
court
on
it.
they
want
to
hear
it
from
your
own
words.
they
don't
just
want
a
summary
affirmation
to
a
lower
three-judge
courts
decision.
now,
i
think
that
if
we
will
--
i
think
that
if
the
lower
courts
would
follow
more
the
mandates
of
2283
and
let
the
conventional
course
of
procedure
go
through,
you
wouldn't
have
a
lot
of
the
problems
you've
had
in
our
case
and
to
the
other
cases
that
i've
heard
today.
one
problem
you've
had
and
all
of
these
cases
have
been
a
lack
of
a
record,
a
lack
of
evidence.
you
can't
really
tell
what
a
case
is
about
unless
you
had
a
trial
on
it.
in
our
case,
we
do
have
a
number
of
affidavits.
for
instance
we
have
affidavits
in
the
record
of
our
sheriff
stating
that
he
received
complaints
from
clergy
and
people
in
the
neighborhood
and
schools
and
churches.
we
have
affidavits
in
our
record
that
showed
that
we
had
minors
in
this
very
store.
we
have
affidavits
of
minors
in
this
record
stating
that
they
went
into
the
store
and
got
publications.
this
is
evident
of
the
fact
that
these
books
do
get
to
the
children
no
matter
what
types
of
safeguards
are
attempted.
in
view
of
this
your
honor,
we
ask
that
you
accept
the
jurisdiction
and
that
you
issue
your
own
pronouncement
as
to
this
prior
adversary
hearing
and
reaffirm
your
decision
of
the
new
york
feed
and
the
milky
way
decisions
and
reaffirm
your
pronouncement
of
the
atlantic
coast
case
in
reference
to
28-2283
to
stop
this
constant
interference
by
federal
district
courts
and
state
court
actions.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
honorable
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
is
that
it?
this
is
a
case
also
involving
obscenity,
is
involving
the
criminal
prosecution
of
appellee
ledesma
in
this
case
both
for
the
sale
of
obscene
publications
and
the
possession
of
obscene
publications
with
the
intent
to
sell.
the
primary
issue
in
this
appeal
raised
on
appeal
is
a
procedural
question
in
enforcing
a
state
statute
and
the
question
as
post
to
the
court
is
whether
or
not
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution
under
a
valid
and
constitutional
state
statute
which
has
been
filed
constitutional
by
the
three-judge
court
relative
to
sale
and
possession
with
intent
to
sale
obscene
materials
and
publications.
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
a
judicial
adversary
hearing
prior
to
the
arrest
and
prosecution
of
the
defendant
to
determine
in
advance
of
his
arrest
or
prosecution
whether
or
not
the
materials
and
publications
involved
are
obscene
under
the
terms
of
the
state
statute.
we
will
have
other
related
issues
which
i
will
cover
in
connection
with
this
in
reference
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
on
appeal
in
light
28
u.s.c.
1253
in
the
gunn
case
which
has
been
discussed.
we
also
have
problems
connected
involving
injunctions
and
declaratory
judgments
under
2283
which
has
also
been
discussed
and
intervention
by
federal
courts
and
state
proceedings
and
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
this
case
originated
on
january
27th
of
1969
when
two
deputies
of
the
st.
bernard
parish
sheriff's
office
and
the
state
of
louisiana
purchased
four
obscene
publications
from
ledesma
at
his
store
in
st.
bernard
parish
in
arabi,
louisiana.
these
publications
and
the
other
publication
i
required
to
are
here
with
the
record
which
i
brought
in
filing
with
this
court.
ledesma
was
arrested
and
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
these
deputies
selected
certain
publications,
the
three-judge
court
found
it
to
be
the
number
45
from
his
shelves
as
evidence.
four
bills
of
information
were
filed
against
him
by
me
in
the
state
court,
two
of
them
under
the
state
statute
relative
to
sale
and
possession
with
intent
to
sell
obscene
publications,
and
two
almost
identical
bills
of
information
under
the
parish
ordinance.
these
two
charges
under
the
parish
ordinance
which
were
almost
identical
to
the
state
ordinance
were
subsequently
now
crossed
or
dropped
by
me.
now
in
this
prosecution
in
the
state
court,
ledesma
was
afforded
an
adversary
judicial
hearing
focusing
on
the
obscenity
of
these
publications
in
the
form
of
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
which
he
filed
under
state
prosecutions.
the
basis,
one
allegation
was
that
our
statute
was
vague
and
overbroad
and
the
other
was
that
the
materials
were
not
obscene.
this
was
decided
within
two
weeks
after
his
arrest,
he
had
his
hearing
in
state
court
and
we
tried
this
issue
and
the
state
judge
denied
the
motions
of
ledesma.
wanting
another
bite
at
the
apple,
he
then
went
to
federal
court
to
ask
the
federal
court
for
relief
under
the
civil
rights
statute
asking
to
declare
both
our
state
statute
and
our
parish
ordinance
unconstitutional
for
vagueness
and
overbroad.
also
asking
for
injunctions
against
pending
and
state
--
and
future
state
prosecutions
and
also
asking
that
we
be
enjoined
from
retaining
the
publication
in
our
possession
and
using
them
at
prosecutions.
also,
he
asked
for
damages
in
the
sum
of
$30,000.00
each
for
his
clients.
after
a
long
and
prolonged
hearing
in
the
court,
not
in
court
but
the
proceeding
in
the
district
court
after
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
on
july
14th
of
1969,
some
five
to
six
months
after
the
arrest,
the
three-judge
court
in
a
two-to-one
decision
with
judge
rubin
dissenting
held
first
all
that
our
state
statute,
the
two
provisions,
subsections
2
and
3
involved
herein
were
held
to
be
constitutional.
judge
rubin
concurred
in
that.
the
court
in
its
order
had
stated
and
i
say
they
alleged
that
they
denied
to
grant
the
injunctive
relief,
grant,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
say
we
specifically
deny
injunctive
relief.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
your
honor,
i'll
get
to
that
but
my
opinion
and
i
think
this
court
will
see
that
we
were
enjoined
both
pending
and
future
prosecutions
were
enjoined
in
this
case.
that
the
court
ordered
its
judgment
in
this
way
so
as
to
get
around
the
provisions
or
article
2283
and
this
court
and
other
cases
which
i
will
give
to
the
court
shortly
look
through
this
particular
type
of
action
by
a
court
where
it
tried
to
evade
2283,
and
actually
had
an
order
which
had
practical
effect,
the
operating
effect
of
an
injunction
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
unless
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
was
deferred
to
hearing
on
the
merits
today.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that
is
right
your
honor.
that
is
the
way
i
construe
the
judgment
of
the
court.
in
the
record
–
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
oh!
that
is
a
common
practice,
your
honor
and
one
that
i
do
not
think
as
advisable
for
a
district
court
to
take
like
that
article
65
subsection
c
of
the
federal
rule
of
the
civil
procedure
is
a
mandate
to
federal
district
courts
especially
the
three-judge
court
that
when
they
are
dealing
in
the
area
of
injunctions
as
was
stated
in
the
footnotes
to
the
gunn
case
by
this
court,
that
they
should
be
specific,
that
it
is
in
effect
unfair
for
them
to
deal
with
areas
such
as
this
and
not
deal
with
them
in
a
clear
manner
so
that
their
intention
is
obvious
to
the
parties,
that
was
the
problem
in
the
gunn
case.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
case
as
opposed
to
other
cases
i've
been
arguing.
we
did
not
agree
to
stop
our
prosecution.
the
record
shows
that
first
of
all,
our
case
was
set
for
trial
in
february
of
1969,
the
record
does
not
show
that
but
a
note
of
evidence
is
a
result
of
a
conference
with
judge
boyle
in
this
case
shows
that
our
case
was
first
set,
again
set
the
trial
on
april
21st
of
1969,
that
is
in
the
record
at
page
1,
page
97
i
think,
my
co-counsel
filed
that.
also,
that
was
continued
to
that
date
to
give
this
three-judge
court
time
to
issue
its
decision
which
it
had
not
done
as
of
that
time.
it
was
continued
to
april
28
of
1969.
it
was
again
continued
by
me
after
a
phone
call
from
the
district
judge
stating
that
the
decision
by
this
three-judge
court
would
be
rendered
in
the
near
future
and
that
we
would
be
able
to
take
whatever
action
we
had
to
after
that.
so
we
did
not
abide
by
any
request.
we
did
not
concede
to
this
court
that
they,
that
we
would
have
to
hold
our
prosecution
prior
to
their
decision.
now,
in
their
decision
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
i
was,
our
order
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that's
right.
they
ordered
us
to
return
all
the
materials
instanter,
instantly
from
this
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
i
would
say
it
is,
your
honor
in
connection
with
the
wording
in
the
judgment
itself
which
said
i
quote
“that
the
pending
prosecutions
should
be
effectively
terminated.”
that
was
the
wording
of
the
judgment
at
page
97
in
the
appendix
to
this
record.
the
pending
prosecution
should
be
effectively
terminated,
now
whether
they
say
should
be
enjoined
or
effectively
terminated,
it
has
the
same
meaning
as
our
contention
that
we
were
enjoined
and
that
this
order
ordering
us
to
give
up
or
evidence
to
return
it
instanter
and
also
to
suppress
it
in
any
prosecutions
that
both
pending
and
future
is
--
has
all
the
practical
and
full
force
and
operative
effect
of
an
injunction
upon
us.
what
better
way
to
stop
our
prosecution
than
to
take
our
evidence
away
from
us
or
to
tell
us
that
we
will
--
we're
not
in
good
faith
continued
prosecutions
or
to
say
that
the
prosecution
should
be
effectively
terminated?
and
your
honor,
there
is
a
case
that
is
not
in
my
brief,
i
wish
to
cite
it
at
the
court,
at
this,
to
the
court
at
this
time
in
connection
with
the
gunn
case
which
came
out
after
my
brief
is
at
the
premise
international
longshoremen's
association
versus
philadelphia
marine
trade
association,
found
at
389
u.s.
64.
in
that
case,
there
was
an
order,
an
arbitration
--
an
arbitration
award
and
a
labor
dispute.
it
was
not
before
the
court
but
then
after
dispute
arose
over
the
arbitration
order,
the
union
went
in
the
court
and
they
asked
the
court
to
give
an
order
and
the
court
gave
this
order,
i
quote,
“that
the
arbitration
award
be
specifically
enforced
and
then
he
went
on
out
of
the
union
to
comply
with
and
abide
with
the
award.”
and
on
the
appeal
to
this
court,
even
though
the
word
injunction
was
not
used,
your
honors
held
that
and
i
quote,
“whether
or
not
the
district
court's
order
was
an
injunction,
it
was
an
equitable
decree,
compelling
obedience
under
the
threat
of
contempt
and
was
therefore
an
order
granting
an
injunction.”
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
sir
that
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
look
at
the
ledesma's
petition,
both
his
original
petition
and
his
amended
petition,
his
prayer
asked
for
injunctive
relief
to
keep
us
from
retaining
the
books
in
our
possession,
that
was
his
request
and
that
is
what
he
got.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
the
injunction
that
he
has
for.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes
your
honor
they
did,
it
was
instanter,
the
only
way
i
could
stop
that
order
was
to
get
a
stay
order
pending
the
appeal
to
this
court
and
that
is
one
of
the
reason
why
the
books
are
here
before
this
court
at
this
time.
i've
transmitted
the
books
here.
they
have
been
introduced
in
evidence
in
this
prior
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court.
so
your
honor,
in
light
of
the
gunn
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
--
in
which
actually
the
word
“injunction”
was
used
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
an
injunction
on
this
labor
in
a
match
on
longshoreman's
case
where
the
word
“injunction”
was
not
used
but
this
court
looked
through
the
attempts
of
the
court
to
evade
the
issue
of
2283
and
actually
issue
an
injunction
even
though
2283
says
it
cannot.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
and
that's
what
we
have
a
right
of
appeal
from.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
that's
the
holding
in
that
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
right
and
just
the
converse
is
true
in
our
case.
it
is
crystal
clear
from
the
decision
who
was
enjoined,
perez
(inaudible)
enjoin.
what
is
enjoined?
prosecution
pending
and
future
under
title
14-106
subsections
2
and
3,
this
is
all
right
in
the
opinion
at
page
97
and
the
prior
pages
and
the
opinion
of
the
court.
what
was
enjoined?
these
pending
and
future
prosecutions
and
arrests.
so
i
think
that
this
complies
with
rule
65
(c).
the
only
abuse
of
discretion
violated
here
by
the
three-judge
court
was
deliberately
making
it
look
like
they
were
not
enjoining
us.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes
your
honor,
and
the
object
--
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
and
the
operative
effect
of
the
order
read
in
light
with
their
opinion.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
and
also
in
the,
another
case
in
which
this,
your
honors
did
the
same
type
of
action,
atlantic
coast
line
case
which
also
was
decided
on
june
of
this
year.
your
honors
also
looked
at
the
order
in
that
case.
the
order
ordered
the
railroad
not
to
take
advantage
of
the
state
court
prosecution.
and
your
honors,
in
that
you
used
the
word
“evade”
so
that
district
three-judge
court
cannot
evade
the
mandate
of
2283
by
enjoining
the
railroad,
will
look
right
through
that
and
see
that
actually
you
are
enjoining
a
pending
state
prosecution.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
right.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
(inaudible)
because
jurisdiction
was
deferred
by
your
honors'
two
argument
today.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
which
i
was
just
arguing
the
case
completely.
i
think
that
would
show
and
not
just
a
prosecution
but
the
retaining
of
the
evidence
and
the
orders
of
the
court.
now,
the
sole
reason
again,
looking
at
the
decision
of
the
court,
the
sole
reason
for
the
entire
decision
of
this
court
can
be
seen
both
in
the
judgment
and
the
footnotes,
appendix
96
and
97
was
that
this
court
felt
that
there
must
be
a
prior
judicial
adversary
hearing
in
this
case.
that
is
a
sole
reason
for
doing
what
they
did
and
they
so
stated.
this
is
a
concept
that
they
derived
from
the
marcus
case
and
a
quantity
of
books
case
which
cases
which
are
referred
to
in
my
brief.
i
wish
to
point
out
again
to
the
court
this
time
that
we
did
have
in
this
case
an
adversary
judicial
determination
of
obscenity,
obscenity.
there
was
a
hearing
in
court
on
the
ledesma's
motion
to
quash
and
motion
to
suppress,
wherein
the
district
court
did
view
the
books
and
made
its
determination.
he
did
have
an
adversary
judicial
determination.
the
only
thing
new
being
requested
is
that
this
be
a
prior
hearing.
that
this
adversary
hearing
be
held
before
any
arrest
or
any
prosecution
of
the
defendant,
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
court
your
honors
have
never
held
that
in
a
criminal
prosecution
that
this
is
necessary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
have
indicated
your
preference
for
the
conventional
course
of
criminal
procedure
in
enforcing
this
cases,
not
to
say
that
other
methods
cannot
be
used
but
i
think
that
in
these
decisions,
francis
and
the
kingsley
books
case,
they
are
where
new
york
attempted
to
supplement
its
conventional
coarse
of
criminal
procedure
in
dealing
with
these
cases.
the
problem
with
the
court
at
that
time
was
that
you
were
hesitant
to
allow
them
to
supplement
their
procedures
and
throughout
the
cases,
roth
case,
albert's
case
which
i
have
quote
in
my
brief
there,
your
honors
indicated
that
such
a
hearing
was
not
necessary
by
its
light.
but
in
the
new
york
feed
case
and
milky
way
cases
which
were
to
decided
in
february
of
1970
by
your
honors,
you
summarily
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
which
held
affirmatively
that
this
adversary
judicial
determination
of
obscenity
was
indeed
a
novelty,
was
unnecessary,
and
afforded
no
special
protection
to
the
books
taking
time
cognizance
of
the
concurring
opinion
of
chief
justice
warren
in
the
roth
case,
that
in
these
cases
involving
criminal
prosecutions,
it
is
the
person
who
is
on
trial,
not
the
books.
that
decision
was
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court
and
as
seen
in
the
record
page
121
of
the
appendix,
after
your
honors
came
out
with
your
summary
affirmation
of
the
new
york
feed
and
milky
way
cases.
i
went
back
to
our
three-judge
panel
and
i
told
them
in
my
motion
which
is
in
the
record
here
that
the
supreme
court
has
finally
decided
this
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
must
be
a
prior
adversary
hearing
in
criminal
prosecutions
and
i
filed
the
motion,
we
argued
the
case,
submitted
memorandums
and
the
motion
was
denied
and
i
submit
that
this
number
one
is
proof
of
the
injunctive
intent
of
the
lower
court
and
also,
your
honor
i
feel
that
in
this
case,
we
are
asking
you
to
take
jurisdiction
and
to
decide
these
issues
because
obviously
from
the
action
of
the
three-judge
court
in
our
case
is
summary
affirmation
by
your
honors,
is
not
enough
to
straighten
out
them
arrest
that
has
resulted
in
three-judge
district
in
this
area,
and
we
must
have
a
pronouncement
from
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
this
type
of
hearing
is
necessary,
and
that
is
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
at
this
time.
we
also
fear
your
honor
that
we
do
have
a
question
argue
in
the
other
cases
before
us,
article
2283,
the
abstention
doctrine
in
view
of
dombrowski,
cameron
and
the
atlantic
coast
cases
and
we
just
wish
to
point
out
strongly
in
line
with
that
that
there
was
no
finding
of
bad
faith
on
our
part
in
this
case.
there
was
specific
finding
of
good
faith
on
our
part
and
the
cameron
case
read
together
with
dombrowski,
the
atlantic
coast
cases
are
specific,
that
before
this
three-judge
courts
can
interpose
themselves
in
place
of
the
united
state
supreme
court
in
state
prosecutions,
that
there
must
be
bad
faith
prosecution,
there
must
be
a
statute
which
is
filed
unconstitutional.
in
our
case,
the
court
specifically
found
that
the
sections
of
our
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
are
constitutional.
now,
the
court
also
abused
its
discretion
in
ordering
us
to
return
these
books
and
in
not
invoking
the
adoption
of
abstention,
and
i
argued
this
in
connection
with
the
court's
action
in
declaring
our
parish
ordinance
unconstitutional.
our
reference
to
our
parish
ordinance
your
honor,
there
was
no
case,
there
was
no
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
action
taken
by
the
course
--
by
the
court.
and
golden
v.
zwickler
which
was
a
clarification
of
zwickler
v.
koota,
this
court
held
that
although
the
court
might
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
declaratory
judgments
where
there's
allegations
of
a
controversy
in
the
absence
of
an
actual
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality,
the
court
should
not
make
declaratory
judgments
in
an
advisory
capacity
only.
the
purpose
of
this
being
obviously
to
keep
the
three-judge
courts
from
taking
the
prerogative
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
issue
these
doctrines
especially
in
this
case
of
obscenity
which
is
so
critical
to
our
whole
procedure
in
prosecuting
these
cases
in
court.
one
obvious
result
that
we
can
see
from
the
three-judge
court's
stepping
into
these
cases
is
the
fact
to
state
in
the
previous
case,
“i
am
curious
yellow”
involving
that,
that
there
are
five
other
cases
pending
in
federal
district
three-judge
courts
involving
the
same
issues
and
its
my
intention
that
if
these
cases
were
allowed
to
go
through
the
normal
course
of
procedure
as
stated
in
the
atlantic
coast
case,
that
we
would
not
have
a
confusion
that
we
have
today
in
this
field
of
obscenity.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
noon
recess,
i'd
--
all
practical
purposes
concluded
the
bulk
of
my
argument.
this
time
i
would
like
to
sum
up
where
i
consider
the
major
points
in
my
argument.
one
is
the
jurisdiction
of
question
which
i
think
that
we
have
answered
clearly
as
far
as
the
injunctive
intent
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case.
also,
the
fact
that
in
cases
involving
criminal
prosecutions
that
there
are
adversary
judicial
hearings,
and
that
in
light
of
this
court's
summary
affirmation
of
the
milky
way
and
new
york
feed
cases,
that
there
is
no
need
to
have
this
hearing
prior
to
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
in
the
case.
at
this,
in
effect
we
give
no
more
protection
to
the
publications
than
having
the
hearing
after
the
arrest.
at
this
extraordinary
protection
which
is
not
allowed
in
federal
law
would
serve
to
help
the
lawbreaker.
it
would
not
have
any
further
effect
in
securing
first
amendment
rights.
we
do
feel
that
there
has
been
a
definite
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion
under
the
provision
and
the
mandates
of
article
2283
and
of
the
dictates
of
this
court
and
the
dombrowski
case,
the
cameron
case
and
the
atlantic
coast
case.
in
our
case,
where
there
has
been
no
finding
of
bad
faith
of
any
kind
by
the
lower
court.
our
state
statute
of
sections
2
and
3,
which
are
the
only
ones
before
this
court
today
have
been
held
constitutional
and
that
there
has
been
no
appeal
taken
from
this
decision
of
the
court
by
appellees
in
this
case.
we
further
feel
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
that
the
doctrine
of
abstention
should
have
been
invoked
in
this
case
in
reference
to
the
three-judge
courts
declaring
our
st.
bernard
parish
police
jury
ordinance
unconstitutional.
i
based
that
on
the
finding
not
in
zwickler
v.
koota
which
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
and
previous
argument
erroneously
i
think,
but
in
the
case
of
golden
v.
zwickler
which
enlarged
this
court's
viewpoints
in
zwickler
v.
koota
and
which
this
court
specifically
held
referring
to
zwickler
v.
koota
from
which
it
originated,
that
there
must
be
a
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality.
there
was
no
such
issue
before
the
three-judge
court
in
our
case
and
that
there
were
no
pending
prosecutions
under
that
ordinance
and
there
were
no,
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecutions
had
been
terminated,
there
were
no
threats
of
any
future
prosecutions
under
that
ordinance.
so
here,
we
have
a
case
of
clear
abuse
by
three-judge
court
under
the
provisions
of
2283
by
interfering
with
state
court
prosecutions
and
going
even
further
than
that
and
legislating
criminal
procedure
for
a
state
court.
i
think
that
in
doing
this,
that
this
federal
three-judge
--
that
this
court
has
abused
its
power
and
you
serve
the
powers
of
this
court
in
deciding
louisiana
law.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
first
like
to
comment
on
the
dial
case
which
has
been
mentioned
in
requisite
of
jurisdiction
of
question.
that
case
was
decided
by
this
court,
the
jurisdiction
was
declined
on
the
same
day
that
your
honors
referred
our
case
to
an
argument
on
the
merits.
i'm
sure
you
saw
the
distinction
in
that
case
as
i
see
between
that
case
and
our
case
and
that
is
on
the
dial
case,
the
court
recognized
that
this
case
involves
only
one
contested
issue
of
law,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
an
adversary
hearing
to
determine
the
question
of
obscenity,
must
be
held
prior
to
the
arrest.
now,
that
was
submitted
by
stipulation
of
the
parties
to
the
court,
strictly
for
the
court
to
decide
that
issue.
there
was
no
pending
prosecution,
there
was
not
even
a
threat
of
future
prosecution
but
this
dial
case
amounts
to
is
a
submission
by
both
sides
for
declaratory
judgment
in
that
case
and
i
appeal
that
that
must
be
what
this
court
recognize
when
it
declines
jurisdiction
in
that
case.
there
was
no
pending
prosecution,
no
treats,
no
issue
other
than
the
one
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
prior
adversary
hearing
is
necessary.
that
was
the
sole
issue
in
the
dial
case
and
what
i
have
just
quoted
to
you
is
from
the
report
and
303
federal
supplement
436
at
page
438.
so
there
is
an
easy
distinction
between
the
dial
case
and
our
case,
well,
this
was
a
contested
case
whether
questions
of
constitutionality
of
our
statute,
there
were
questions
of
bad
faith
and
unfortunately
the
statute
and
this
is
an
easy
distinction
to
make.
there
have
been
some
comments
made
by
counsel
concerning
not
either
using
the
word
“threats”
i
don't
think
but
something
akin
to
that
by
the
police
officers
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
in
the
finding
of
the
district
court
after
a
hearing
on
this
case,
they
wanted
to
hear
an
affidavit
so
we
heard
it
on
affidavit
but
we
did
submit
affidavits,
they
found
no
bad
faith,
they
found
no
threats,
they
found
no
bad
faith
at
all
in
our
part.
their
decision
was
made
strictly
on
this
question
of
the
adversary
hearing
which
is
an
erroneous
decision.
this
case
--
this
issue
has
been
settled
by
this
court
and
the
new
york
feed
and
milky
way
cases
which
asked
the
specific
question
and
this
court
affirmed
that
decision.
this
time
we're
asking
the
court
to
reaffirm
that
decision,
your
decision
in
the
milky
way
and
new
york
cases
using
your
own
words
that
once
and
for
all,
these
three-judge
courts
will
understand
what
your
honors
are
telling
them.
this
is
the
problem
that
happens
when
we
have
so
many
federal
three-judge
courts
interfering
with
state
prosecutions,
each
one
of
them
giving
their
own
pronouncement
and
they
are
so
different.
it
has
caused
great
confusion
in
the
law
and
a
lot
of
confusion
as
to
field
of
obscenity
has
been
caused
not
by
your
honors
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
but
by
the
three-judge
courts
that
have
so
many
varying
opinions
as
to
what
should
be
the
law
of
the
land
in
its
area.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes
your
honor,
both.
i
say
that
in
this
case,
in
this
particular
instance
concerning
prior
adversary
hearing,
your
honors
have
spoken
out
on
this.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
in
the
new
york
feed
and
milky
way
cases.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
the
evidence
of
the
entire
overall
problem
of
the
three-judge
courts
making
pronouncements
that
really
should
be
made
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
livaudais
yes,
have
been
made,
have
been
made
but
unfortunately,
in
that
case
was
a
summary
affirmation.
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
i
couldn't
sell
our
court
on
it.
they
want
to
hear
it
from
your
own
words.
they
don't
just
want
a
summary
affirmation
to
a
lower
three-judge
courts
decision.
now,
i
think
that
if
we
will
--
i
think
that
if
the
lower
courts
would
follow
more
the
mandates
of
2283
and
let
the
conventional
course
of
procedure
go
through,
you
wouldn't
have
a
lot
of
the
problems
you've
had
in
our
case
and
to
the
other
cases
that
i've
heard
today.
one
problem
you've
had
and
all
of
these
cases
have
been
a
lack
of
a
record,
a
lack
of
evidence.
you
can't
really
tell
what
a
case
is
about
unless
you
had
a
trial
on
it.
in
our
case,
we
do
have
a
number
of
affidavits.
for
instance
we
have
affidavits
in
the
record
of
our
sheriff
stating
that
he
received
complaints
from
clergy
and
people
in
the
neighborhood
and
schools
and
churches.
we
have
affidavits
in
our
record
that
showed
that
we
had
minors
in
this
very
store.
we
have
affidavits
of
minors
in
this
record
stating
that
they
went
into
the
store
and
got
publications.
this
is
evident
of
the
fact
that
these
books
do
get
to
the
children
no
matter
what
types
of
safeguards
are
attempted.
in
view
of
this
your
honor,
we
ask
that
you
accept
the
jurisdiction
and
that
you
issue
your
own
pronouncement
as
to
this
prior
adversary
hearing
and
reaffirm
your
decision
of
the
new
york
feed
and
the
milky
way
decisions
and
reaffirm
your
pronouncement
of
the
atlantic
coast
case
in
reference
to
28-2283
to
stop
this
constant
interference
by
federal
district
courts
and
state
court
actions.
thank
you.
