unknown
speaker
well,
did
they
deny
or
did
they
grant
injunctive
relief
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
was
an
injunction
here,
you
can't
appeal
here
can
you?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there,
wasn't
there
a
court
order
though
other
than
a
declaratory
judgment?
i
mean
the
order
is
set,
return
all
the
materials
--
unknown
speaker
in
the
order,
did
they
order
you
to
return
all
the
materials
and
not
to
use
them
at
any
future
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
an
injunction,
is
that
an
injunction
for
or
an
injunctive
order
for
purposes
of
the
--
our
appellant
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well
that,
you
don
t
have
to,
to
have
jurisdiction
here,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
order
enjoining
a
criminal
prosecution?
all
you
have
to
have
is
an
injunction.
and
if
the
federal
court
issues
an
order
requiring
you
not
to
use
certain
evidence
in
a
pending
criminal
prosecution,
isn't
that
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
case,
i
think
the
court
held
that
it
was
an
order
granting
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
and
they
refer,
it
went
on
to
half
hold
that
it
did
not
comply
with
the
federal
rules,
that
it
was
so
ambiguous
and
unclear
an
order
that
they
couldn't
expect
anybody
to
abide,
wasn't
the
holding
on
that
case?
unknown
speaker
or
nobody
could
know
what
it
for,
what
if
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
what
you
have
to
look
at
ultimately
is
not
their
opinion
but
the
order,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
which
is
at
pages
106
and
107
here.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
if
you
continue
to
get
that
far
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
we
don't
need
to
prove
that
the
prosecution
was
a
little
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
was
a
--
you
said
which
the
court
in
your
submission
did
not
enjoin,
do
you
think
there
was
any
injunction
here?
was
there
an
order
granting
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
has
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
spite
say
that,
it
said
that
the
preliminary
and
permanent
injunctions
prayed
for
to
be
denied.
that's
what
it
says,
it
wasn't
issuing
any
injunctions.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
suppose
the
effect
of
paragraph
2
of
the
order
in
this
case
would
have
on
any
future
criminal
prosecutions?
unknown
speaker
on
page
107.
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
effect?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
citation?
unknown
speaker
did
we
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
d-i-a-l?
unknown
speaker
and
there's
an
injunction
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
--
assume
a
state
statute
for
example
authorizes
wiretapping
in
the
use
of
evidence
to
criminal
cases
under
controlled
situation
and
a
man
is
indicted
and
is
about
to
go
to
trial
and
he
sues
in
the
federal
court
to
enjoin,
to
have
declared
unconstitutional
the
state
wiretapping
statute
and
to
enjoin
the
use
of
the
any
wiretap
testimony
in
his
criminal
trial
and
the
federal
court
declares
a
statute
of
constitutional
and
does
enjoin
the
use
of
any
of
that
evidence,
that's
roughly
these
situations
in
nature.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would,
you
think
that
the
dial
case
means
there's
no
jurisdiction
here?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
know
the
number
of
the
value?
unknown
speaker
you
said
long
week
ago?
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
have
an
amount
or
value,
you
know
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
it's
309
--
299
u.s.
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
how
did
it
form
that
the
order
reaches
the
dial
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
might
also
suggestive
that
it
requires
a
bit
of
wasted
time
of
members
of
federal
courts.
it's
a
problem
that
perhaps
is
easy
and
certified
by
second
circuit
by
the
first
circuit,
but
in
the
larger
geographical
circuits,
the
very
assembling
of
one
circuit
judge,
which
is
required
by
the
statute,
two
district
judges
and
if
they're
traveling
to
wherever
the
court
is
going
to
be
held
is
a
great,
can
add
up
to
a
great
deal
of
expenditure
of
judicial
time,
and
if
as
it
turns
out,
most
of
this
cases
end
up
by
getting
dismissed.
it
suggests
it's
a
bit
of
waste
of
time,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
with
the
motion.
unknown
speaker
you
believe?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
are
now
addressing
yourself
not
to
the
propriety
of
any
action
of
a
three-judge
court
in
cases
generally
but
you're
talking
about
the
necessary
antecedent
conditions
to
an
obscenity
prosecution,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
your
talking
about
that
now?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say,
have
been
made
in
the
milky
way
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
they
deny
or
did
they
grant
injunctive
relief
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
was
an
injunction
here,
you
can't

you?

or
an
injunctive
