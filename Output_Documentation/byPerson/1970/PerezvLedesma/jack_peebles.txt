mr.
jack
peebles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
there
are
basically
three
issues
which
this
case
present
to
this
court
at
this
time.
first,
there
is
the
threshold
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
in
view
of
the
provisions
on
section
1253.
once
that
hurdle
is
passed,
i
submit
that
the
issues
then
are
first,
did
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
the
relief
it
granted
or
does
section
2283,
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute
prevent
the
court
below
from
taking
the
action
that
it
took?
and
then
the
third
question,
if
this
court
has
jurisdiction
and
the
court
below
properly
considered
the
issues
on
the
merits
below,
then
did
it
properly
decide
the
merits
in
this
case?
but
before
getting
into
those
questions,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
certain
facts
in
this
case
which
i
think
are
relevant
and
should
be
called
in
with
the
court's
attention.
when
august
ledesma,
the
newsstand
operator
in
this
case
decided
to
mark
off
a
section
of
his
new
store
chalmette,
louisiana
and
sell
within
that
section
to
adults
only
erotic
literature.
he
did
sell
with
a
full
knowledge
that
the
sheriff's
department
was
aware
of
what
he
was
doing
and
would
be
watching
what
he
was
doing.
he
was
not
secreting
his
publication.
he
was
not
selling
them
even
under
the
counter.
so
that
the
sheriff's
department
had
adequate
time
to
take
any
procedural
measures
that
are
constitutionally
required.
they
cannot
argue
that
there
was
any
impediment
of
time
or
fact
which
would
have
prevented
them
from
giving
ledesma
the
full
measure
of
his
procedural
constitutional
protection
to
which
he
would
be
entitled.
but
in
view
of
this
fact
on
january
27,
1969,
after
watching
his
store
for
sometime,
they
went
in,
purchased
a
couple
of
magazines,
briefly
looked
at
them
and
then
arrested
him
and
seized
45
other
of
his
publications
on
hand.
they
did
not
seek
to
obtain
nor
did
they
obtain
an
arrest
warrant.
they
did
not
seek
to
obtain
nor
did
they
obtain
a
search
warrant.
they
did
not
seek
to
have
nor
was
held
any
kind
of
adversary
hearing
before
a
judge
or
magistrate
which
could
have
given
them
any
kind
of
judicial
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
these
publications
were
obscene.
rather
this
way
occurred,
something
because
two
members
of
the
sheriff's
department
in
this
parish
in
louisiana
decided
that
in
their
family,
publications
were
obscene.
now
there
was
only
one
prosecution
in
this
case
that's
true
but
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
further
that
the
deputy
sheriff
made
it
clear
that
the
rest
of
these
magazines
that
were
in
that
store
had
better
be
taken
off
the
stand.
the
affidavit
filed
by
ledesma
and
by
his
attorney
below
indicated
that
one
of
the
deputies
told
him
on
three
separate
occasions,
you'd
better
get
rid
of
the
rest
of
these
magazines,
and
of
course
there's
no
doubt
what
he
was
talking
about,
there
would
have
been
further
prosecutions
if
he
had
not
done
so.
now,
in
view
of
that
fact,
the
three-judge
court
below
rendered
certain
relief.
first,
it
declared
that
this
part
of
the
state
statute
and
the
parish
ordinance
were
unconstitutional.
now,
this
case
below
was
combined
with
another
case
called
delta
book
distributors
versus
cronvich,
and
in
the
other
case
with
which
this
case
was
combined
below,
the
defendant
and
the
criminal
defendants
had
been
charged
under
section
7
of
the
state
obscenity
act.
so
that
in
this
decision
in
this
case,
the
court
below
held
that
section
7
of
the
state
obscenity
act
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
for
overbreadth.
and
in
view
of
the
statements
by
this
court
in
zwickler
versus
koota,
we
feel
that
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
further,
the
court
below
declared
that
procedure
of
arresting
and
seizing
these
publications
without
an
adversary
hearing
was
unconstitutional.
and
then
the
court
ordered
a
return
of
the
seized
magazines
and
their
suppression
in
evidence
in
the
state
of
criminal
prosecution.
and
the
court
below
did
not
enjoin
the
state
criminal
prosecution
and
specifically
declined
to
do
so.
he
did
not
enjoin
further
arrest
in
the
future.
it
did
not
enjoin
the
state
prosecution
facing
ledesma
resulting
from
these
seizures.
it
simply
exercised
its
authority
as
a
court
protecting
federal
rights
by
determining
what
would
happen
to
these
magazines
and
specifically
it
said,
give
the
magazines
back
because
you
seized
them
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jack
peebles
that
depends
your
honor
on
what
we
mean
by
an
injunction
and
of
course
it
takes
us
right
into
the
threshold
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
--
mr.
jack
peebles
--
probably
has
jurisdiction.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
specifically
said
that
it
did
not
enjoin
the
defendants
and
--
mr.
jack
peebles
it
certainly
did
your
honor
and
it
only
enjoined
the
use
of
that
evidence,
it
required
that
that
evidence
be
returned
to
the
petitioners
below.
now,
in
view
of
that
decision
by
the
court,
we
now
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
of
the
dial
versus
fontaine
decided
by
this
court
june
29,
1970
but
mr.
justice
douglas
dissenting.
in
that
case,
the
facts
are
substantially
similar
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
in
dial
against
fontaine,
this
court
held
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
i'd
like
to
mention
briefly
the
facts
in
the
dial
case
and
dial
arising
from
the
western
district
of
texas,
police
authorities
had
seized
a
movie
and
the
only
question
before
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
that
case
was,
was
the
seizure
proper.
that
court
held
in
dial
against
fontaine
below
that
the
procedure
for
seizure
was
unconstitutional
and
it
declared
it
to
be
unconstitutional.
second,
in
dial
the
three-judge
court
below
as
in
our
case
ordered
the
material
which
had
been
seized
to
be
returned.
and
third,
in
the
dial,
the
court
below
prohibited
the
defendants
from
utilizing
the
statute
in
the
future
without
a
prior
adversary
hearing,
having
been
held.
but
just
in
our
case
and
the
dial
case,
the
court
below
refuse
to
interfere
in
any
matter
with
the
criminal
prosecution
based
upon
the
showing
of
the
film.
mr.
jack
peebles
what
page
is
it
on?
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
it
would
have
the
effect
your
honor
of
making
it
impossible
for
the
prosecution
to
proceed.
and
likewise,
i
think
in
dial,
the
requirement
that
the
materials
be
returned
likely
would
have
the
same
effect.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
can
only
say
that
in
dial,
this
court
felt
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
i
don't
see
a
distinguishing
factor
in
that
case
between
that
case
and
this
case
on
that
threshold
trust.
mr.
jack
peebles
with
dial
your
honor?
dial
was
decided
june
the
29th
by
this
court
and
the
citation
below
was
303
federal
supplement
436.
mr.
jack
peebles
you
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
citing
gunn.
mr.
jack
peebles
d-i-a-l.
yes,
your
honor
and
in
that
case
you
cited
gunn
versus
university
committee
as
the
basis
for
your
decision.
but
if
this
court
does
feel
that
an
injunction
was
issued
here
and
thus
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
appeal.
then
we
raise
the
further
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
below
properly
exercised
its
discretion,
and
whether
it
in
fact
was
forbidden
by
2283
from
doing
what
it
did.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
did.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
would
seem
so
to
me
your
honor
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
held
no
jurisdiction
in
dial
in
which
case,
the
court
there
also
required
a
return
of
the
seized
materials
and
there
may
be
some
question
about.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
frankly.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
dial
case
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
and
i
cannot
find
a
distinguishing
factor
between
that
case
and
this
case.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
but
assuming
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
then
does
2283,
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute
--
mr.
jack
peebles
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
peebles
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
it
was
–
mr.
jack
peebles
--argued
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
jack
peebles
below
your
honor
are
here,
recorded
in
here,
i
have
it
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
it's
a
long
week,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
number
1032
the
october
term
cited
at
90
supreme
court
2235.
mr.
jack
peebles
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
dial
case
decided
by
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
peebles
it
served
first
this
as
facts
and
opinion
giving
the
lower
court
citation
june
29,
1970
per
curium,
the
appeal
is
dismissed
for
one
of
jurisdiction,
gunn
versus
university
committee,
mr.
justice
douglas
dissents
from
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal.
if
the
court
please,
yesterday,
an
argument
of
other
counsel
fairly,
adequately
covered
i
think,
the
question
of
the
fact
that
2283
may
have
won
the
civil
rights
statute.
surprising
to
say
that
we
simply
take
the
position
that
the
civil
rights
act
is,
one
of
--
is
enact
which
expressly
provides
for
the
injunction
and
it
is
an
exception
and
one
the
exceptions
filled
out
in
the
language
of
the
federal
anti-
injunction
act.
we
feel
that
the
reconstruction
congress
of
1871
clearly
intended
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
the
federal
court
should
intervene
on
a
state
proceeding.
however,
we
would
point
out
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
2283
should
not
be
considered
a
bar
because
the
court
below
did
not
grant
“an
injunction
to
state
proceedings
on
a
state
court,”
which
is
the
language
of
2283.
now,
it
did
suppress
the
evidence
and
it
did
exercise
jurisdiction
over
those
magazines
by
requiring
them
to
be
returned
but
it
specifically
did
not
stay
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
it
did
not
say
they
could
not
go
forward
with
the
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
could
not
effectively,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
there
is
no
effective
difference
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
they'd
specifically
stayed
the
injunction
or
simply
had
the
effect
of
staying
the
injunction,
and
we
submit
that
if
it's
merely
have
the
effect
of
staying
that
proceedings
below,
then
it
would
not
be
forbidden
by
the
anti-injunctions.
mr.
jack
peebles
they
did
that,
true.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
interpret
that
your
honor
to
mean
that
if
the
state
should
resume
prosecution,
they
would
then
exercise
their
authority
to
effectuate
their
declaratory
judgment
by
enjoining
the
state
prosecution.
that's
my
interp
--
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
it
would
have
been
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
so.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor,
no
question
about
it.
now,
with
regard
to
2283,
yesterday,
mr.
justice
stewart
inquired
one
of
the
attorneys
as
to
whether
any
studies
had
been
made
of
the
increase
number
of
request
for
three-judge
courts
and
their
effect
from
the
judicial
system.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
located
a
comment
in
the
april
1970
edition
of
the
harvard
law
review
which
may
be
appropriate
there.
and
an
article
entitled
section
1983
jurisdiction,
the
commentator
pointed
out
that
an
examination
of
100
private
civil
rights
cases
reported
in
the
federal
supplement
from
december
1966
to
march
1968,
shows
that
67
were
dismissed
without
a
trial
or
hearing,
the
vast
majority
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
“the
statistics
suggest”
said
the
writer,
“that
most
section
1983
cases
even
now
are
quickly
disposed
off
and
pose
little
time
problem
for
federal
courts”.
and
the
remaining
35
cases,
plaintiffs
obtain
preliminary
relief
and
12
without
an
evidentiary
hearing.
only
seven
cases
appeared
to
have
been
tried
and
five
of
those
resulted
in
a
judgment
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
your
honor,
it
can,
certainly
this
process
can
be
abused.
however,
if
complaint
is
considered
frivolous,
the
district
court
is
under
no
obligation
to
request
a
three-judge
court.
and
i
submit
that
this
situation
is
roughly
analogous
to
the
removal
situation.
now,
there
for
a
while,
we
have
a
flurry
of
removal
cases.
but
once
they've
seen
that
the
federal
courts
simply
are
not
going
to
inappropriately
intervene,
unless
there
is
really
a
chilling
effect
by
the
prosecution
in
the
state
criminal
case,
then
counsel
will
surely
learn
not
to
waste
their
time.
but
we
submit
that
the
decision
initially
as
to
whether
or
not
to
implement
the
provisions
of
the
injunctive
authority
should
be
with
the
rest
with
the
district
court.
federal
state
relations
were
not
to
see
manage
for
the
future
and
we
don't
know
that
there
might
be
sometime
in
the
future
in
which
federal
courts
will
find
it
very
necessary
to
intervene
in
these
situations.
we
submit
that
the
discretion
of
the
lower
court
should
be
respected
and
perhaps
to
call
on
a
phrase,
the
court
should
exercise
appellate
judicial
restraint
in
that
regard
and
permit
the
different
courts
to
make
that
initial
determination.
incidentally,
the
sixth
circuit
on
september
the
9th
in
the
case
of
honey
versus
goodman
held
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
did
not
bar
1983
proceeding,
even
after
the
proceedings
were
instituted
in
state
court,
so
that
at
least
in
the
view
of
that
court,
the
atlantic
coast
line
decision
from
this
court
does
not
mean
that
you
can't
proceed
with
the
1983
action.
now,
to
move
on
to
the
third
question
then
--
mr.
jack
peebles
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
jack
peebles
the
1983
was
passed
as
part
of
the
original
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
believe
--
mr.
jack
peebles
1793
i
believe
is
the
original
anti-injunction
statutes.
the
original
anti-injunction
statute
i
believe
was
1793,
your
honor.
it's
a
very
early
statute,
very
early
statute.
so
that
the
reconstruction
of
congress
has
that
in
mind
and
nonetheless
passed
1983
providing
for
suits
and
equity
in
these
provisions.
now,
to
come
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
argued
specifically
on
the
question
of
whether
an
adversary
hearing
is
required
before
an
arrest
can
be
made.
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
that
fact
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
judicial
supervision
whatsoever,
there's
no
application
for
an
arrest
warrant
or
search
warrant
either
and
none
was
obtained
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
all
the
time
they
needed
in
order
to
attempt
to
obtain
such.
but
we
would
go
further
than
that
and
argue
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
its
determination
that
there
should
be
if
time
and
circumstances
permit
in
the
specific
fact
situation
involved,
then
there
should
be
a
prior
adversary
judicial
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
obscenity
of
the
publications
before
the
publications
can
be
disturbed
by
the
prosecuting
officials.
now,
we
say
that
because
that
is
the
method
by
which
the
publications
can
be
given
a
maximum
procedural
protection
to
which
we
feel
that
presumptively
protected
first
amendment
materials
are
entitled.
simultaneous
things
from
this
court
have
indicated
that
there
maybe
materials
that
are
hardcore
and
that
this
can
be
recognized
easily
but
speaking
from
the
standpoint
of
someone
like
ledesma,
i
can
assure
the
court
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
distinguish
between
those
publications
which
will
get
you
in
danger
of
prosecution
and
of
conviction
and
those
publications
which
are
safe.
it
is
impossible
to
do
so.
and
our
neighboring
state
of
mississippi,
we
recently
had
one
federal
district
court
to
hold
that
the
movie
“the
fox”
was
not
obscene
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
neighboring
district
judge
in
mississippi
held
that
it
was
hard
core
pornography,
the
very
same
film.
now,
there
are
simply
differences
in
this
area
of
obscenity
because
of
the
subject,
the
values
involved.
and
the
opinions
of
the
deputy
sheriff
from
st.
bernard's
parish
can
be
so
different
from
those
of
newsstand
operator,
an
attorney
or
a
judge.
we
feel
that
the
only
safe
approach
to
take
as
long
as
the
court
does
feel
that
there
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
possess
and
disseminate
erotic
materials
under
controlled
circumstances.
as
long
as
this
court
takes
the
position
that
the
state
can
suppress
the
very
controlled
dissemination
of
these
materials
then
surely
there
must
be
a
procedure
by
which
the
newsstand
operator
can
know
what's
safe
for
him
to
sell
and
what
is
not
safe
for
him
to
sell.
we
submit
that
experiences
shown
that
in
circumstances
of
obscenity,
the
only
fair
way
in
a
situation
in
which
an
adversary
hearing
can
be
held
is
to
grant
the
newsstand
operator
an
adversary
hearing.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
peebles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
there
are
basically
three
issues
which
this
case
present
to
this
court
at
this
time.
first,
there
is
the
threshold
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
in
view
of
the
provisions
on
section
1253.
once
that
hurdle
is
passed,
i
submit
that
the
issues
then
are
first,
did
the
court
below
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
the
relief
it
granted
or
does
section
2283,
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute
prevent
the
court
below
from
taking
the
action
that
it
took?
and
then
the
third
question,
if
this
court
has
jurisdiction
and
the
court
below
properly
considered
the
issues
on
the
merits
below,
then
did
it
properly
decide
the
merits
in
this
case?
but
before
getting
into
those
questions,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
certain
facts
in
this
case
which
i
think
are
relevant
and
should
be
called
in
with
the
court's
attention.
when
august
ledesma,
the
newsstand
operator
in
this
case
decided
to
mark
off
a
section
of
his
new
store
chalmette,
louisiana
and
sell
within
that
section
to
adults
only
erotic
literature.
he
did
sell
with
a
full
knowledge
that
the
sheriff's
department
was
aware
of
what
he
was
doing
and
would
be
watching
what
he
was
doing.
he
was
not
secreting
his
publication.
he
was
not
selling
them
even
under
the
counter.
so
that
the
sheriff's
department
had
adequate
time
to
take
any
procedural
measures
that
are
constitutionally
required.
they
cannot
argue
that
there
was
any
impediment
of
time
or
fact
which
would
have
prevented
them
from
giving
ledesma
the
full
measure
of
his
procedural
constitutional
protection
to
which
he
would
be
entitled.
but
in
view
of
this
fact
on
january
27,
1969,
after
watching
his
store
for
sometime,
they
went
in,
purchased
a
couple
of
magazines,
briefly
looked
at
them
and
then
arrested
him
and
seized
45
other
of
his
publications
on
hand.
they
did
not
seek
to
obtain
nor
did
they
obtain
an
arrest
warrant.
they
did
not
seek
to
obtain
nor
did
they
obtain
a
search
warrant.
they
did
not
seek
to
have
nor
was
held
any
kind
of
adversary
hearing
before
a
judge
or
magistrate
which
could
have
given
them
any
kind
of
judicial
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
these
publications
were
obscene.
rather
this
way
occurred,
something
because
two
members
of
the
sheriff's
department
in
this
parish
in
louisiana
decided
that
in
their
family,
publications
were
obscene.
now
there
was
only
one
prosecution
in
this
case
that's
true
but
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
further
that
the
deputy
sheriff
made
it
clear
that
the
rest
of
these
magazines
that
were
in
that
store
had
better
be
taken
off
the
stand.
the
affidavit
filed
by
ledesma
and
by
his
attorney
below
indicated
that
one
of
the
deputies
told
him
on
three
separate
occasions,
you'd
better
get
rid
of
the
rest
of
these
magazines,
and
of
course
there's
no
doubt
what
he
was
talking
about,
there
would
have
been
further
prosecutions
if
he
had
not
done
so.
now,
in
view
of
that
fact,
the
three-judge
court
below
rendered
certain
relief.
first,
it
declared
that
this
part
of
the
state
statute
and
the
parish
ordinance
were
unconstitutional.
now,
this
case
below
was
combined
with
another
case
called
delta
book
distributors
versus
cronvich,
and
in
the
other
case
with
which
this
case
was
combined
below,
the
defendant
and
the
criminal
defendants
had
been
charged
under
section
7
of
the
state
obscenity
act.
so
that
in
this
decision
in
this
case,
the
court
below
held
that
section
7
of
the
state
obscenity
act
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
for
overbreadth.
and
in
view
of
the
statements
by
this
court
in
zwickler
versus
koota,
we
feel
that
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
further,
the
court
below
declared
that
procedure
of
arresting
and
seizing
these
publications
without
an
adversary
hearing
was
unconstitutional.
and
then
the
court
ordered
a
return
of
the
seized
magazines
and
their
suppression
in
evidence
in
the
state
of
criminal
prosecution.
and
the
court
below
did
not
enjoin
the
state
criminal
prosecution
and
specifically
declined
to
do
so.
he
did
not
enjoin
further
arrest
in
the
future.
it
did
not
enjoin
the
state
prosecution
facing
ledesma
resulting
from
these
seizures.
it
simply
exercised
its
authority
as
a
court
protecting
federal
rights
by
determining
what
would
happen
to
these
magazines
and
specifically
it
said,
give
the
magazines
back
because
you
seized
them
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jack
peebles
that
depends
your
honor
on
what
we
mean
by
an
injunction
and
of
course
it
takes
us
right
into
the
threshold
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
--
mr.
jack
peebles
--
probably
has
jurisdiction.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
specifically
said
that
it
did
not
enjoin
the
defendants
and
--
mr.
jack
peebles
it
certainly
did
your
honor
and
it
only
enjoined
the
use
of
that
evidence,
it
required
that
that
evidence
be
returned
to
the
petitioners
below.
now,
in
view
of
that
decision
by
the
court,
we
now
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
of
the
dial
versus
fontaine
decided
by
this
court
june
29,
1970
but
mr.
justice
douglas
dissenting.
in
that
case,
the
facts
are
substantially
similar
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
in
dial
against
fontaine,
this
court
held
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
i'd
like
to
mention
briefly
the
facts
in
the
dial
case
and
dial
arising
from
the
western
district
of
texas,
police
authorities
had
seized
a
movie
and
the
only
question
before
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
that
case
was,
was
the
seizure
proper.
that
court
held
in
dial
against
fontaine
below
that
the
procedure
for
seizure
was
unconstitutional
and
it
declared
it
to
be
unconstitutional.
second,
in
dial
the
three-judge
court
below
as
in
our
case
ordered
the
material
which
had
been
seized
to
be
returned.
and
third,
in
the
dial,
the
court
below
prohibited
the
defendants
from
utilizing
the
statute
in
the
future
without
a
prior
adversary
hearing,
having
been
held.
but
just
in
our
case
and
the
dial
case,
the
court
below
refuse
to
interfere
in
any
matter
with
the
criminal
prosecution
based
upon
the
showing
of
the
film.
mr.
jack
peebles
what
page
is
it
on?
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
it
would
have
the
effect
your
honor
of
making
it
impossible
for
the
prosecution
to
proceed.
and
likewise,
i
think
in
dial,
the
requirement
that
the
materials
be
returned
likely
would
have
the
same
effect.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
can
only
say
that
in
dial,
this
court
felt
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
i
don't
see
a
distinguishing
factor
in
that
case
between
that
case
and
this
case
on
that
threshold
trust.
mr.
jack
peebles
with
dial
your
honor?
dial
was
decided
june
the
29th
by
this
court
and
the
citation
below
was
303
federal
supplement
436.
mr.
jack
peebles
you
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
citing
gunn.
mr.
jack
peebles
d-i-a-l.
yes,
your
honor
and
in
that
case
you
cited
gunn
versus
university
committee
as
the
basis
for
your
decision.
but
if
this
court
does
feel
that
an
injunction
was
issued
here
and
thus
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
appeal.
then
we
raise
the
further
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
below
properly
exercised
its
discretion,
and
whether
it
in
fact
was
forbidden
by
2283
from
doing
what
it
did.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
did.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
would
seem
so
to
me
your
honor
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
held
no
jurisdiction
in
dial
in
which
case,
the
court
there
also
required
a
return
of
the
seized
materials
and
there
may
be
some
question
about.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
frankly.
mr.
jack
peebles
the
dial
case
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
and
i
cannot
find
a
distinguishing
factor
between
that
case
and
this
case.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
but
assuming
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
then
does
2283,
the
federal
anti-injunction
statute
--
mr.
jack
peebles
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
peebles
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
it
was
–
mr.
jack
peebles
--argued
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
jack
peebles
below
your
honor
are
here,
recorded
in
here,
i
have
it
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
it's
a
long
week,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
number
1032
the
october
term
cited
at
90
supreme
court
2235.
mr.
jack
peebles
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
dial
case
decided
by
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
peebles
it
served
first
this
as
facts
and
opinion
giving
the
lower
court
citation
june
29,
1970
per
curium,
the
appeal
is
dismissed
for
one
of
jurisdiction,
gunn
versus
university
committee,
mr.
justice
douglas
dissents
from
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal.
if
the
court
please,
yesterday,
an
argument
of
other
counsel
fairly,
adequately
covered
i
think,
the
question
of
the
fact
that
2283
may
have
won
the
civil
rights
statute.
surprising
to
say
that
we
simply
take
the
position
that
the
civil
rights
act
is,
one
of
--
is
enact
which
expressly
provides
for
the
injunction
and
it
is
an
exception
and
one
the
exceptions
filled
out
in
the
language
of
the
federal
anti-
injunction
act.
we
feel
that
the
reconstruction
congress
of
1871
clearly
intended
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
the
federal
court
should
intervene
on
a
state
proceeding.
however,
we
would
point
out
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
2283
should
not
be
considered
a
bar
because
the
court
below
did
not
grant
“an
injunction
to
state
proceedings
on
a
state
court,”
which
is
the
language
of
2283.
now,
it
did
suppress
the
evidence
and
it
did
exercise
jurisdiction
over
those
magazines
by
requiring
them
to
be
returned
but
it
specifically
did
not
stay
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
it
did
not
say
they
could
not
go
forward
with
the
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
jack
peebles
it
could
not
effectively,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
there
is
no
effective
difference
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
they'd
specifically
stayed
the
injunction
or
simply
had
the
effect
of
staying
the
injunction,
and
we
submit
that
if
it's
merely
have
the
effect
of
staying
that
proceedings
below,
then
it
would
not
be
forbidden
by
the
anti-injunctions.
mr.
jack
peebles
they
did
that,
true.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
interpret
that
your
honor
to
mean
that
if
the
state
should
resume
prosecution,
they
would
then
exercise
their
authority
to
effectuate
their
declaratory
judgment
by
enjoining
the
state
prosecution.
that's
my
interp
--
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
it
would
have
been
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
think
so.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor,
no
question
about
it.
now,
with
regard
to
2283,
yesterday,
mr.
justice
stewart
inquired
one
of
the
attorneys
as
to
whether
any
studies
had
been
made
of
the
increase
number
of
request
for
three-judge
courts
and
their
effect
from
the
judicial
system.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
located
a
comment
in
the
april
1970
edition
of
the
harvard
law
review
which
may
be
appropriate
there.
and
an
article
entitled
section
1983
jurisdiction,
the
commentator
pointed
out
that
an
examination
of
100
private
civil
rights
cases
reported
in
the
federal
supplement
from
december
1966
to
march
1968,
shows
that
67
were
dismissed
without
a
trial
or
hearing,
the
vast
majority
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
“the
statistics
suggest”
said
the
writer,
“that
most
section
1983
cases
even
now
are
quickly
disposed
off
and
pose
little
time
problem
for
federal
courts”.
and
the
remaining
35
cases,
plaintiffs
obtain
preliminary
relief
and
12
without
an
evidentiary
hearing.
only
seven
cases
appeared
to
have
been
tried
and
five
of
those
resulted
in
a
judgment
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
your
honor,
it
can,
certainly
this
process
can
be
abused.
however,
if
complaint
is
considered
frivolous,
the
district
court
is
under
no
obligation
to
request
a
three-judge
court.
and
i
submit
that
this
situation
is
roughly
analogous
to
the
removal
situation.
now,
there
for
a
while,
we
have
a
flurry
of
removal
cases.
but
once
they've
seen
that
the
federal
courts
simply
are
not
going
to
inappropriately
intervene,
unless
there
is
really
a
chilling
effect
by
the
prosecution
in
the
state
criminal
case,
then
counsel
will
surely
learn
not
to
waste
their
time.
but
we
submit
that
the
decision
initially
as
to
whether
or
not
to
implement
the
provisions
of
the
injunctive
authority
should
be
with
the
rest
with
the
district
court.
federal
state
relations
were
not
to
see
manage
for
the
future
and
we
don't
know
that
there
might
be
sometime
in
the
future
in
which
federal
courts
will
find
it
very
necessary
to
intervene
in
these
situations.
we
submit
that
the
discretion
of
the
lower
court
should
be
respected
and
perhaps
to
call
on
a
phrase,
the
court
should
exercise
appellate
judicial
restraint
in
that
regard
and
permit
the
different
courts
to
make
that
initial
determination.
incidentally,
the
sixth
circuit
on
september
the
9th
in
the
case
of
honey
versus
goodman
held
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
did
not
bar
1983
proceeding,
even
after
the
proceedings
were
instituted
in
state
court,
so
that
at
least
in
the
view
of
that
court,
the
atlantic
coast
line
decision
from
this
court
does
not
mean
that
you
can't
proceed
with
the
1983
action.
now,
to
move
on
to
the
third
question
then
--
mr.
jack
peebles
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
jack

mr.

i
believe
--
mr.
jack
peebles
1793
i
believe
is
the
original
anti-injunction
statutes.
the
original
anti-injunction
statute
i
believe
was
1793,
your
honor.
it's
a
very
early
statute,
very
early
statute.
so
that
the
reconstruction
of
congress
has
that
in
mind
and
nonetheless
passed
1983
providing
for
suits
and
equity
in
these
provisions.
now,
to
come
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
argued
specifically
on
the
question
of
whether
an
adversary
hearing
is
required
before
an
arrest
can
be
made.
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
that
fact
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
judicial
supervision
whatsoever,
there's
no
application
for
an
arrest
warrant
or
search
warrant
either
and
none
was
obtained
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
all
the
time
they
needed
in
order
to
attempt
to
obtain
such.
but
we
would
go
further
than
that
and
argue
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
its
determination
that
there
should
be
if
time
and
circumstances
permit
in
the
specific
fact
situation
involved,
then
there
should
be
a
prior
adversary
judicial
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
obscenity
of
the
publications
before
the
publications
can
be
disturbed
by
the
prosecuting
officials.
now,
we
say
that
because
that
is
the
method
by
which
the
publications
can
be
given
a
maximum
procedural
protection
to
which
we
feel
that
presumptively
protected
first
amendment
materials
are
entitled.
simultaneous
things
from
this
court
have
indicated
that
there
maybe
materials
that
are
hardcore
and
that
this
can
be
recognized
easily
but
speaking
from
the
standpoint
of
someone
like
ledesma,
i
can
assure
the
court
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
distinguish
between
those
publications
which
will
get
you
in
danger
of
prosecution
and
of
conviction
and
those
publications
which
are
safe.
it
is
impossible
to
do
so.
and
our
neighboring
state
of
mississippi,
we
recently
had
one
federal
district
court
to
hold
that
the
movie
“the
fox”
was
not
obscene
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
neighboring
district
judge
in
mississippi
held
that
it
was
hard
core
pornography,
the
very
same
film.
now,
there
are
simply
differences
in
this
area
of
obscenity
because
of
the
subject,
the
values
involved.
and
the
opinions
of
the
deputy
sheriff
from
st.
bernard's
parish
can
be
so
different
from
those
of
newsstand
operator,
an
attorney
or
a
judge.
we
feel
that
the
only
safe
approach
to
take
as
long
as
the
court
does
feel
that
there
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
possess
and
disseminate
erotic
materials
under
controlled
circumstances.
as
long
as
this
court
takes
the
position
that
the
state
can
suppress
the
very
controlled
dissemination
of
these
materials
then
surely
there
must
be
a
procedure
by
which
the
newsstand
operator
can
know
what's
safe
for
him
to
sell
and
what
is
not
safe
for
him
to
sell.
we
submit
that
experiences
shown
that
in
circumstances
of
obscenity,
the
only
fair
way
in
a
situation
in
which
an
adversary
hearing
can
be
held
is
to
grant
the
newsstand
operator
an
adversary
hearing.
thank
you.
