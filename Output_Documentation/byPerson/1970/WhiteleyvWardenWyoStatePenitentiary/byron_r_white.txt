justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
critical
proposition
here
that
if
an
arresting
officer
lead
through
the
radio
that
he
is
supposed
to
arrest
a
man,
he
can
arrest
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
american
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
saying
that
the
probable
cause,
is
that
obtained
in
the
police
broadcast,
that’s
all
the
arresting
officer
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
that
the
officer
looking
out
to
broadcast
himself
at
no
probable
cause
to
put
it
out.
let’s
just
assume
that.
yet
you
would
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
couldn't
describe
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
would
--
you
conceive
that
there
must
be
probable
cause
in
the
police
department
that
up
the
broadcast.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right
and
you’re
saying
--
and
you
concede
that
he
asked
some
help?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
what
was
it?
what
was
this
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
ogburn
didn’t
see
or
commit
the
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
he
had
is
a
telephone
tip
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
record
is
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
like
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
that?
but
you
have
to
have
fact
which
shows
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
one
of
the
facts
that
ogburn
had
which
this
record
disposes
from
which
we
may
make
the
inference
that
they
add
up
the
probable
cause
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
been
so
found
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what,
what,
what
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
broadcast
police?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
obviously,
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
that
state.
the
arrest
was
made
in
what
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
this
is
the
laramie,
this
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
ogburn’s
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
carbon
county,
all
right.
i’ve
done
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
should
be
interesting.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
this
is
the
broadcast
mr.
speight.
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
confused
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
a
sense
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
a
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
--
i
mean
you
know
what
was
in
the
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
detriment
of
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
all
that
really
amounts
to
is
that
he
had
word
other
that
by
his
informant
that
this
defendant
does
that
job.
that’s
all
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
know
the
chamber
has
made
it
very
expressive
although
you
might
not
need
a
warrant
to
search
the
car
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
get
back
again
to
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
probable
cause
the
officer
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
anymore
than
this
if
you
lost
this
case
you
can
still
proceed
against
them
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
trial
with
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
an
hour
or
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
think
it
should
be
making
the
same
argument
here
if
ogburn
had
heard
about
burglaries
and
said
well
there
are
only
two
people
in
this
whole
area
that
i
suspect
of
this
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i’m
going
to
put
out
on
the
broadcast
to
arrest
them
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn’t
you?
and
they
arrested
them,
he
was
dead
right.
they
found
in
his
car
the
evidence.
and
they
convicted
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suggest
that
you
told
this
is
not
much
different
and
hypothetical
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
much
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
told
us
was
in
a
small
county,
you
isolate,
you
can
put
your
finger
on
two
or
three
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
thing
looked
as
all
one
of
them
and
someone
called
up
and
said
this
was
the
guy.
so
he
arrested
him
but
at
the
broadcast
and
the
rest
of
it
what
you
told.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
mr.
ogburn
step,
it
is
–
goes
to
him
and
says
there
has
been
a
robbery
here
to
this
tavern,
and
i
think
there
are
only
two
fellows
in
town
and
that
really
have
done
that
and
ogburn
as
i
agree
with
you,
arrest
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
objection
to
the
evidence
on
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
under
wyoming
procedure,
this
maybe
raised
by
objection
to
the
evidence
of
the
trial
even
though
no
motion
to
suppress
is
made
before
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
opposition
to
the
objection
was
not
made
on
the
ground
that
no
motion
to
suppress
had
been
made
before
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
once
they
said
--
once
he
got
brought
out
that
was
from
a
tip,
he
had
negative
personal
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
that
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
enough
for
that
defense
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
gone
to
ahead
and
build
the
state's
case
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
win,
this
case
would
just
be
reversed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
critical
proposition
here
that
if
an
arresting
officer
lead
