all
the
officer
had
you
seen
it
at
the
place,
at
the
time
of
the
burglary
or
what
was
to
be
committed,
have
you
seen
him
run
out,
arrest
him
and
then
also
you
had
a
warrant,
would
you
say
that
he
could
arrest
him
on
this
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.

so
that
is
an
issue
in
each
case,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
found?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
been
in
the
hardware
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
doubt
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
just
put
it
in
his
car.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
response
to
this
colloquy
because
i
thought
it
matches
the
defined
question.
you
said
the
test
of
the
validity
of
this
arrest
was
the
fact
that
the
arresting
authorities,
what’s
that
county
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
acting
on
this
police
broadcast
that
was
the
probable
cause.
and
then
it
didn’t
make
any
difference,
so
far
as
the
validity
of
that
arrest
is
concerned.
what
state
of
the
affairs
was
the
county
where
the
crime
is
committed.
in
other
words,
to
put
it
--
it
makes
no
difference
on
your
theory
where
there
was
any
probable
cause
and
the
police
officer
ogburn
to
arrest
him
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
now
you
say
to
my
brother
white
that
you
--
you
think
that
there
must
be
something
in
the
way
of
probable
cause
in
the
part
of
the
authorities
who
issued
the
broadcast.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
seem
to
be
addressing
everything
here
except
whether
he
is
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
you
really
have
mr.
speight,
it
was
a
burglar.
was
it
committed
at
night?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
laramie
county
it’s
all
of
information,
all
we
have
to
know
that
some
men
whose
name
he
knew
had
tattoo
mark
was
there,
he
sends
out
a
note
and
goes
out.
the
man
from
the
automobile
gets
arrested.
the
question
is
who
gives
that
information,
probable
cause
so
that
you
can
defend
it,
and
it's
not
only
said
to
be
probable
cause
but
they
find
the
things
that
were
stolen
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
forget
the
integrity
and
not
--
what
you
have
is
you
know
from
what
you
find,
what
has
been
given
or
insane,
or
crazy
of
whom,
that
is
given
by
somebody
who
knew
about
the
car
and
they
go
and
find
their
things
have
been
stolen,
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
your
sheriff
protected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
have
a
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
don’t
you
think
somebody
had
told
the
sheriff
something
about
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
the
officer
had
you
