justice
potter
stewart
their
position
is
that
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
whether
the
affidavit
is
defective.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
sure
of
your
position.
your
position
is
that
even
if
there
were
no
affidavit
which
was
defective,
if
the
affidavit
didn’t
exist
that
still
you
would
have
a
case
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
what
the
facts
are,
right?
you’re
setting
up
a
string
of
dominoes.
and
if
--
i
think
your
theory
is
that
one
tips,
the
whole
group
tips.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
asking
supposed
your
case
were
such
factually
that
there
never
was
an
affidavit,
then
would
you
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
take
it,
you
will
expand
on
this,
and
this
is
what
i
meant
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
rustic
bar,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
let
me
ask
another
fact
question,
with
what
was
the
defendant
charged?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
be
a
little
more
specific.
he
was
charged
with
breaking
and
entering
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
original
affidavit
had
nothing
to
do
with
shively’s
hardware
store?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
we
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
was
charged
with
something
different
than
the
affidavit
had
to
do
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
was
there
a
second
affidavit?
wasn’t
it
the
formal
charge
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
necessarily
your
possession
however,
that
despite
this
difference
in
the
accusatory
affidavit
originally
having
to
do
with
the
rustic
tavern
i
think
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
charge
which
was
breaking
and
entering
the
shively’s
hardware
store,
it
still
falls
as
one
of
the
dominant.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don’t
you
have
to
contend
that
the
search
is
unlawful
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
it’s
really
a
fruit
of
an
unlawful
arrest
as
you
have
mentioned.
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
arrest
itself
i
supposed
was
cured
and
if
any
defect
in
arrest
of
the—in
the
arrest
himself,
let’s
there
had
been
no
search
and
no
seizure
only
what
you
say
was
an
invalid
arrest
and
then
he
was
brought
to
trial
and
sufficient
evidence
was
brought
out
to
convict
him,
he
certainly
couldn’t
get
the
conviction
set
aside.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
did
put
an
evidence
what
they
found
in
the
car.
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
room
for
harmless
error?
justice
potter
stewart
what
happened
to
daley,
did
he
plead?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you’re
saying
in
effect
is
that
the
arrest
at
least
broadcast
is
in
itself
a
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
underlying
circumstances
were
at
that
time
with
respect
to
the
law
enforcement
agencies
on
this
particular
government.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
the
proposition
is?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
--
i
agree
with
the
importance
to
justices
questions
that
we
really
are
interested
in
what
probable
cause
ogburn
had
that
if
the
record
doesn’t
show
probable
cause
for
his
putting
out
the
broadcast
of
what
are
we
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
gather
the
form
anyway
if
you
prevail
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
district
court.
you
give
the
state
an
opportunity
to
put
him
--
give
another
trial
or
else
police
them,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
ordinarily,
i
think
the
form
is
it
goes,
this
is
federal
habeas
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court
with
the
instructions
of
the
district
court
to
give
the
state
a
reasonable
opportunity
30,
60
days
whatever
it
is
to
bring
and
give
him
a
new
trial
or
else
to
release
him.
