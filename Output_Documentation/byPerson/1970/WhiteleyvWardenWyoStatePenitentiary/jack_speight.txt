mr.
jack
speight
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel.
i
like
to
direct
myself
to
several
questions
that
the
court
has
raised
before
i
go
in
to
discussion,
my
aspect
of
the
case.
i
might
add
that
my
good
friend,
the
counsel
here
and
i,
he
at
the
law
school
and
i
in
the
attorney
general’s
office
have
been
fighting
this
for
four
years.
we
started
with
it
at
that
first
federal
court
level
and
have
taken
a
right
through
and
we’ve
lost
issues
along
the
way
and
now
we’re
done
with
the
real
knob.
and
we
do
have
a
great
familiar
work,
familiar
hierarchy
with
this
case
as
this
court
obviously
by
its
questions.
but
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
on
justice
blackmun’s
question
because
i
think
you
put
your
finger
right
on
the
case.
we
have
consistently
argued
from
all
levels
of
the
court
that
we
could
care
less
about
that
arrest
warrant
that
is
quite
immaterial
to
our
proposition.
that
we’re
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
and
or
the
search.
the
judge
kerr,
the
federal
district
judge,
brought
the
argument.
the
tenth
circuit
judge
hecky
writing
the
opinion
about
the
argument
and
now
we’re
here
at
this
court.
and
justice
blackmun,
this
is
the
key
question
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause,
we
think
it’s
quite
immaterial
whether
or
not
there
was
effective
arrest
warrant
and
we
go
one
step
further.
i
think
you
again
diagnosed
the
case
right
on
point
when
you
say
there
were
two
complaints
and
arrest
warrant’s
issued.
one
for
the
burglary
of
the
rustic
bar
and
the
other
which
she
was
actually
tried
on
the
arrest
of
the
hardware
store.
now,
in
wyoming
we
currently
have
adopted
the
criminal
rules
of
procedures
which
are
patterned
after
the
federal
rules.
but
at
this
time
in
wyoming
we
were
operating
under
some
old
statutes
that
are
not
unique
or
different
throughout
the
country.
there
quite
somewhere
to
many
other
states.
and
it’s
simply
this
that
a
complaint
is
filed
usually
by
a
law
enforcement
officer.
based
upon
that
complaint
and
arrest
and
or
search
warrant
is
issued.
the
arrest
is
made,
an
information
is
filed
which
is
in
lieu
of
the
grand
jury
hearing.
at
a
preliminary
hearing
probable
cause
is
determined
and
the
sequence
is
immediately
whipped.
whiteley
was
arrested
on
the
24th
of
that
evening.
the
next
morning
the
arrest
warrant
and
the
criminal
complaint
were
filed
against
him.
the
information
was
filed
and
a
preliminary
hearing
held
before
a
magistrate
in
rawlins,
wyoming
determined
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause.
the
probable
cause
being
found
it
was
set
for
trial
and
again
the
jury
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
he
committed
the
crime.
mr.
jack
speight
the
search
was
taken
on
the
24th
sir.
it
was,
the
facts
were
basically
this
--
mr.
jack
speight
excuse
me
sir,
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
question?
mr.
jack
speight
no
sir,
there
wasn’t
and
we
feel
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
sir?
mr.
jack
speight
well
based
on
the
probable
cause
concept.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
jack
speight
i
think
you’re
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jack
speight
yes.
and
--
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
not
the
critical
proposition
justice
white,
the
critical
proposition
is
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes
and
the
probable
cause
existed
as
a
record
bears
it
out.
mr.
jack
speight
well
simply
the
fact
of
--
the
particulars
detailed
in
the
police
broadcast.
they
were
looking
for
a
man,
we
described
the
man.
we’re
looking
for
a
car,
we
described
the
car.
we’re
looking
for
certain
stolen
--
mr.
jack
speight
right,
right.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
no,
i
couldn’t
say
that
in
good
conscience
because
that’s
not
the
law.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i’m
saying
if
it
please
the
court
and
in
this
reflected
on
one
of
the
questions
that
chuck
ogburn,
the
sheriff
had
probable
cause.
he
was
the
one
to
put
up
the
broadcast.
mr.
jack
speight
yes.
mr.
jack
speight
the
probable
cause
was
the
information
that
he
had,
that
whiteley
had
committed
the
crime
or
he
felt
he
had
committed
the
crime.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
he
certainly
--
mr.
jack
speight
well,
now
this
is
where
the
record
is
void,
your
honor.
and
this
is
the
--
mr.
jack
speight
void
--
this
type
of
information.
mr.
jack
speight
and
this
is
our
argument.
see
we’ve
actually
been
relying,
and
it’s
on
draper
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
that
you
can
make
a
warrantless
arrest
if
you
have
probable
cause.
now,
if
this
late
date
we
are
going
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
and
we
--
mr.
jack
speight
may
i
cite
you
record
references
if
it
please
the
court?
mr.
jack
speight
record
17,
which
is
the
laramie
police
department
bulletin,
record
31
which
was
--
mr.
jack
speight
record
17
--
mr.
jack
speight
no,
this
is
what
was
posted
at
the
laramie
police
department
bulletin
board.
mr.
jack
speight
the
carbon
county.
mr.
jack
speight
at
albany
county.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
sheriff
ogburn’s
county
was
carbon
county.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i
might
be
confusing
the
court.
we
ought
to
start
on
page
31.
mr.
jack
speight
let’s
start
on
page
31.
this
was
the
original
instrument
that
got
the
whole
thing
in
the
process.
this
was
the
original
state
item
881.
this
was
issued
by
so,
sheriffs
office
at
rawlins.
and
the
pertinent
part
is
that
paragraph.
mr.
jack
speight
page
31
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes.
mr.
jack
speight
well
--
mr.
jack
speight
this
is
the
question
--
mr.
jack
speight
albany
county
in
laramie,
wyoming.
mr.
jack
speight
this
was
a
fact
determination
made
by
the
wyoming
supreme
court
and
has
been
substantiated
throughout,
that
the
laramie
law
enforcement
officers
had
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
not
only
that
but
they
had
the
duty
to
make
the
arrest.
so
as
to
your
question,
yes,
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
i
didn’t
make
the
original
case,
the
wyoming
supreme
court
although
--
this
is
in
the
record
and
i
don’t
know
what
the
wyoming
supreme
court
gaged
its
theories
on
except
what
they
write
and
what
they
write
--
mr.
jack
speight
i
know
your
honor.
mr.
jack
speight
all
right
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
in
this
the
record
is
the
void
officer.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
he
had
that
and
he
had
the
information
that
appears
in
the
state
item
881.
mr.
jack
speight
this
i
don’t
know.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
jack
speight
in
my
feeling,
indeed
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
it
was
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
at
that
time,
how
far
was
the
petitioner,
the
defendant
away
from
--
mr.
jack
speight
they
didn’t
know.
they
knew
he
was
in
the
saratoga,
wyoming
or
laramie,
wyoming
area
which
is
about
50
miles
apart.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
it
doesn’t
sir.
no,
it
doesn’t.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
he
didn’t.
mr.
jack
speight
it’s
the
state’s
burden.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i
wouldn’t.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
that
doesn’t
make
it
good.
that
might
give
a
law
enforcement
officer
a
defense
in
a
civil
suit
on
false
arrest
but
that
doesn’t
necessarily
make
it
good.
the
reason
in
this
case
that
we
only
--
not
only
did
we
name
the
defendant,
we
gave
the
description
of
his
height,
his
tattoo
marks,
the
law
enforcement
officer
has
said
and
it’s
in
the
record
that
they
knew
what
whiteley
looked
like,
one
of
the
arresting
officers,
so
they
knew
who
they
were
looking
for.
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
correct.
mr.
jack
speight
that’s’
correct
sir.
and
i’m
somewhat
apologetic
because
i
don’t
feel
i've
answered
possibly
your
question
or
mr.
justice
white’s
question
on
this.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
we’ve
got
to
make
a
determination
in
the
state
fields
that
there
is
probable
cause
in
the
record
when
you
read
it.
and
you
read
it
in
light
of
the
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
jack
speight
well
there’s
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
you’ve
got
your
finger
right
on.
now
if
i
can
go
one
step
further
justice
white
and
this
maybe
some
assistance
to
you
in
terms
of
the
probable
cause,
i
would
like
to
offer
the
court
an
alternative.
and
this
is
in
the
area
of
the
case
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
we
are
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
strongly
feel
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
an
absolute
amendment.
it
does
have
some
limitations
based
on
reasonableness.
now
on
the
case
of
chambers
versus
maroney
which
was
written
after
the
state's
brief
was
submitted,
after
the
state’s
brief
was
printed.
this
was
a
moving
vehicle.
they
stopped
the
moving
vehicle.
they
got
out,
they
placed
the
defendant
and
his
accomplice
in
the
backseat
of
the
police
car
which
was
parked
right
behind
the
moving
vehicle
and
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
to
the
key
question.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
mr.
justice
white
analyzing
this
case,
i’ve
looked
at
a
case
of
this
court
where
there
was
not
probable
cause
that
was
the
beck
case.
and
i
feel
that
we
have
a
better
record
than
they
had
in
beck.
and
based
on
that,
i
feel
we
have
probable
cause
in
this
record
and
only
this
court
on
an
independent
determination
of
the
record
can
justify
whether
or
not
--
mr.
jack
speight
well,
unfortunately
in
probable
cause
cases,
the
issue
usually
isn’t
raised
until
we
are
somewhere
down
the
road
beyond
the
trial
level
or
beyond
any
evidentiary
hearing
level.
now,
i
know
things
beyond
the
record
of
which
we
can’t
go
into
today
that
in
my
own
mind,
at
least
i
know
that
was
probable
cause
but
over
and
above
that
what
is
in
the
record.
the
record
is
that
a
person
told
sheriff
ogburn
that
he
had
--
that
he
believed
why
he
made
the
arrest
or
performed
the
burglar.
there
was
a
general
rash
of
burglaries
in
the
area.
small
counties
being
what
they
are.
there
was
not
many
suspects
that
you
have
to
have
to
key
in
on.
you
can
usually
eliminate
it
down
to
one
or
two.
in
this
case,
they
eliminated
it
down
to
one
or
two
and
of
course
as
justice
black
said
there
was
the
counter
band,
there
were
his
finger
prints.
there
were
his
accomplice’s
words
in
the
record.
all
before
the
illegally
seized
evidence
was
introduced
in
the
testimony.
and
it’s
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
as
the
draper
case
said
probability
is
that
there
was
probable
cause.
an
rpm
standard
could
be
applied
to
this
case
and
a
law
enforcement
officer
could
make
the
arrest.
mr.
jack
speight
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
this
again
goes
into
a
whole
new
realm
of
jurisprudence
of
what
can
be
waived
and
what
cannot.
but
at
this
late
date,
it
certainly
puts
a
handicap
on
law
enforcement
and
those
are
on
behalf
of
law
enforcement
to
reconstruct
something
that
we
don’t
have
an
opportunity
to
make
an
evidentiary
record
on.
if
this
court
is
inclined
in
this
area,
give
us
one
shot
of
an
evidentiary
record
back
in
federal
court
we’ll
get
chuck
ogburn
understand,
we’ll
get
judge
castle
jp
understand,
then
we’ll
develop
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
what
went
through
their
minds.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir,
he
--
there
are
several
area.
mr.
jack
speight
it
was
about
--
mr.
jack
speight
mr.
justice
white
it
was
about
a
days
trial,
little
over
days
trial
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
might
add,
i
get
very
competent
counsel
at
the
trial
level.
the
facts
have
changed.
the
law
has
changed
since
‘64.
this
is
really
what
we’re
talking
about.
and
we
get
in
the
final
analysis,
if
we
set
through
fascinating
argument
yesterday
on
the
civil
liability
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
i
think
this
is
what
we’re
--
we’ve
got
to
keep
our
eye
on
the
rabbit.
if
we’re
going
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
individual
which
is
imperative
that
we
do
that
we
not
isolate
an
arrest
because
when
you
look
at
the
whole
spectrum
of
criminal
law,
we
are
talking
beyond
the
arrest,
we’re
talking
of
preliminary
hearing,
we’re
talking
about
trial
and
with
the
(inaudible)
at
this
court
in
the
last
three
or
four
years,
due
process
is
provided
to
defendant
and
we
can
isolate
the
arrest
from
the
trial.
at
least
i
can
in
my
rules
and
that
if
really
we
feel
that
people
are
being
arbitrary
law
enforcement
officer,
being
arbitrary
in
the
final
analysis
when
civil
liabilities
–
tort
liabilities
are
filed
against
false
arrest,
this
will
make
the
leaders
out.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
mr.
jack
speight
i
think
probable
cause
means
little
more
than
a
gut
suspicion
if
you
will
sir
and
so
on
and
so
--
mr.
jack
speight
no,
it’s
not
much
but
in
my
mind
--
mr.
jack
speight
a
quantum
enough
to
meet
probable
cause.
mr.
jack
speight
i
say
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
my
question
then
would
be
what
more
is
really
needed
and
i
guess
that’s
my
word
here.
mr.
jack
speight
well
this
maybe
deviating
a
little
but
i
hope
we
haven’t’
gotten
to
the
point
that
we
can’t
--
we
cannot
–-
that
we’ve
tied
the
hands
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
so
we
can’t
go
in
and
make
investigative
type
discussions.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
after
10:00,
so
reveals
the
record.
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
it
depends
on
what
was
in
the
call
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
speight
but
i
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
jack
speight
well,
i
think
the
hypothetical
goes
beyond
that,
it
can
be
anonymous
call
sheriff,
harold
whiteley
just
did
something.
sheriff,
harold
whiteley
did
something--
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
right,
that’s
right
it
is
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i
don’t.
i’m
saying
the
record
that
is
before
this
court,
i’m
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
after
reading
the
record
that
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
no.
that’s
beyond
that.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
that’s
beyond
it.
when
you
--
when
you
detail
a
man
with
particularly
the
type
of
the
car
he
was
driving
or
what
will
be
in
the
trunk
of
that
car
that
to
me
is
probable
cause.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
it
certainly
does.
in
the
sheriff’s
subjective
analysis
and
unfortunately
at
this
point
of
our
records
to
avoid
of
this
but
we
have
--
we
can
speculate
from
the
record
that
this
is
what
happened.
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
there
wasn’t
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
if
i
can
address
myself
to
this
point.
when
we
were
in
judge
kerr’s
court
mr.
chief
justice,
we
had
six
issues
before
us.
of
the
six,
i
think
in
all
fairness
both
counsel
and
i
put
that
somewhere
down
the
priority
scale.
we
were
more
concerned
with
being
tried
for
double
jeopardy
and
this
several
other
legal
issues
which
we
spent
great
time
in
oral
argument
and
secondly
there
was
limitation
of
time
and
we
were
really
acting
in
reliance
upon
lower
court
decision
and
upon
this
court's
decision
as
to
probable
cause.
and
judge
kerr
bought
this,
he
put
it
in
a
specific
finding
in
his
record
which
he
does
a
nice
job
at
on
page
81,
judge
hickey
picks
this
up
of
page
91
of
his
appellate
brief.
and
if
there
was
error
involved
here,
it
was
on
the
states
acting
in
reliance
upon
prior
supreme
court
decisions
that
we
felt
in
our
mind
that
was
probable
cause.
if
this
would
have
been
the
only
issue
before
judge
kerr
and
this
what
have
sunk
or
floated
our
lawsuit.
i
can
guarantee
we
have
to
develop
a
record
at
that
stage.
but
quite
frankly
i
didn’t
feel
that
it
was
that
an
important
of
an
issue
of
some
other
issues
that
had
been
on
this
case.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
he
is
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
he
does
sir.
there’s
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
their
attention.
mr.
jack
speight
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel.
i
like
to
direct
myself
to
several
questions
that
the
court
has
raised
before
i
go
in
to
discussion,
my
aspect
of
the
case.
i
might
add
that
my
good
friend,
the
counsel
here
and
i,
he
at
the
law
school
and
i
in
the
attorney
general’s
office
have
been
fighting
this
for
four
years.
we
started
with
it
at
that
first
federal
court
level
and
have
taken
a
right
through
and
we’ve
lost
issues
along
the
way
and
now
we’re
done
with
the
real
knob.
and
we
do
have
a
great
familiar
work,
familiar
hierarchy
with
this
case
as
this
court
obviously
by
its
questions.
but
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
on
justice
blackmun’s
question
because
i
think
you
put
your
finger
right
on
the
case.
we
have
consistently
argued
from
all
levels
of
the
court
that
we
could
care
less
about
that
arrest
warrant
that
is
quite
immaterial
to
our
proposition.
that
we’re
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
and
or
the
search.
the
judge
kerr,
the
federal
district
judge,
brought
the
argument.
the
tenth
circuit
judge
hecky
writing
the
opinion
about
the
argument
and
now
we’re
here
at
this
court.
and
justice
blackmun,
this
is
the
key
question
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause,
we
think
it’s
quite
immaterial
whether
or
not
there
was
effective
arrest
warrant
and
we
go
one
step
further.
i
think
you
again
diagnosed
the
case
right
on
point
when
you
say
there
were
two
complaints
and
arrest
warrant’s
issued.
one
for
the
burglary
of
the
rustic
bar
and
the
other
which
she
was
actually
tried
on
the
arrest
of
the
hardware
store.
now,
in
wyoming
we
currently
have
adopted
the
criminal
rules
of
procedures
which
are
patterned
after
the
federal
rules.
but
at
this
time
in
wyoming
we
were
operating
under
some
old
statutes
that
are
not
unique
or
different
throughout
the
country.
there
quite
somewhere
to
many
other
states.
and
it’s
simply
this
that
a
complaint
is
filed
usually
by
a
law
enforcement
officer.
based
upon
that
complaint
and
arrest
and
or
search
warrant
is
issued.
the
arrest
is
made,
an
information
is
filed
which
is
in
lieu
of
the
grand
jury
hearing.
at
a
preliminary
hearing
probable
cause
is
determined
and
the
sequence
is
immediately
whipped.
whiteley
was
arrested
on
the
24th
of
that
evening.
the
next
morning
the
arrest
warrant
and
the
criminal
complaint
were
filed
against
him.
the
information
was
filed
and
a
preliminary
hearing
held
before
a
magistrate
in
rawlins,
wyoming
determined
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause.
the
probable
cause
being
found
it
was
set
for
trial
and
again
the
jury
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
he
committed
the
crime.
mr.
jack
speight
the
search
was
taken
on
the
24th
sir.
it
was,
the
facts
were
basically
this
--
mr.
jack
speight
excuse
me
sir,
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
question?
mr.
jack
speight
no
sir,
there
wasn’t
and
we
feel
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
sir?
mr.
jack
speight
well
based
on
the
probable
cause
concept.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
jack
speight
i
think
you’re
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jack
speight
yes.
and
--
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
not
the
critical
proposition
justice
white,
the
critical
proposition
is
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes
and
the
probable
cause
existed
as
a
record
bears
it
out.
mr.
jack
speight
well
simply
the
fact
of
--
the
particulars
detailed
in
the
police
broadcast.
they
were
looking
for
a
man,
we
described
the
man.
we’re
looking
for
a
car,
we
described
the
car.
we’re
looking
for
certain
stolen
--
mr.
jack
speight
right,
right.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
no,
i
couldn’t
say
that
in
good
conscience
because
that’s
not
the
law.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i’m
saying
if
it
please
the
court
and
in
this
reflected
on
one
of
the
questions
that
chuck
ogburn,
the
sheriff
had
probable
cause.
he
was
the
one
to
put
up
the
broadcast.
mr.
jack
speight
yes.
mr.
jack
speight
the
probable
cause
was
the
information
that
he
had,
that
whiteley
had
committed
the
crime
or
he
felt
he
had
committed
the
crime.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
he
certainly
--
mr.
jack
speight
well,
now
this
is
where
the
record
is
void,
your
honor.
and
this
is
the
--
mr.
jack
speight
void
--
this
type
of
information.
mr.
jack
speight
and
this
is
our
argument.
see
we’ve
actually
been
relying,
and
it’s
on
draper
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
that
you
can
make
a
warrantless
arrest
if
you
have
probable
cause.
now,
if
this
late
date
we
are
going
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
and
we
--
mr.
jack
speight
may
i
cite
you
record
references
if
it
please
the
court?
mr.
jack
speight
record
17,
which
is
the
laramie
police
department
bulletin,
record
31
which
was
--
mr.
jack
speight
record
17
--
mr.
jack
speight
no,
this
is
what
was
posted
at
the
laramie
police
department
bulletin
board.
mr.
jack
speight
the
carbon
county.
mr.
jack
speight
at
albany
county.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
sheriff
ogburn’s
county
was
carbon
county.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i
might
be
confusing
the
court.
we
ought
to
start
on
page
31.
mr.
jack
speight
let’s
start
on
page
31.
this
was
the
original
instrument
that
got
the
whole
thing
in
the
process.
this
was
the
original
state
item
881.
this
was
issued
by
so,
sheriffs
office
at
rawlins.
and
the
pertinent
part
is
that
paragraph.
mr.
jack
speight
page
31
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes.
mr.
jack
speight
well
--
mr.
jack
speight
this
is
the
question
--
mr.
jack
speight
albany
county
in
laramie,
wyoming.
mr.
jack
speight
this
was
a
fact
determination
made
by
the
wyoming
supreme
court
and
has
been
substantiated
throughout,
that
the
laramie
law
enforcement
officers
had
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
not
only
that
but
they
had
the
duty
to
make
the
arrest.
so
as
to
your
question,
yes,
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
i
didn’t
make
the
original
case,
the
wyoming
supreme
court
although
--
this
is
in
the
record
and
i
don’t
know
what
the
wyoming
supreme
court
gaged
its
theories
on
except
what
they
write
and
what
they
write
--
mr.
jack
speight
i
know
your
honor.
mr.
jack
speight
all
right
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
in
this
the
record
is
the
void
officer.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
he
had
that
and
he
had
the
information
that
appears
in
the
state
item
881.
mr.
jack
speight
this
i
don’t
know.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
jack
speight
in
my
feeling,
indeed
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
it
was
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
at
that
time,
how
far
was
the
petitioner,
the
defendant
away
from
--
mr.
jack
speight
they
didn’t
know.
they
knew
he
was
in
the
saratoga,
wyoming
or
laramie,
wyoming
area
which
is
about
50
miles
apart.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
it
doesn’t
sir.
no,
it
doesn’t.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
he
didn’t.
mr.
jack
speight
it’s
the
state’s
burden.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i
wouldn’t.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
that
doesn’t
make
it
good.
that
might
give
a
law
enforcement
officer
a
defense
in
a
civil
suit
on
false
arrest
but
that
doesn’t
necessarily
make
it
good.
the
reason
in
this
case
that
we
only
--
not
only
did
we
name
the
defendant,
we
gave
the
description
of
his
height,
his
tattoo
marks,
the
law
enforcement
officer
has
said
and
it’s
in
the
record
that
they
knew
what
whiteley
looked
like,
one
of
the
arresting
officers,
so
they
knew
who
they
were
looking
for.
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
correct.
mr.
jack
speight
that’s’
correct
sir.
and
i’m
somewhat
apologetic
because
i
don’t
feel
i've
answered
possibly
your
question
or
mr.
justice
white’s
question
on
this.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
we’ve
got
to
make
a
determination
in
the
state
fields
that
there
is
probable
cause
in
the
record
when
you
read
it.
and
you
read
it
in
light
of
the
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
jack
speight
well
there’s
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
you’ve
got
your
finger
right
on.
now
if
i
can
go
one
step
further
justice
white
and
this
maybe
some
assistance
to
you
in
terms
of
the
probable
cause,
i
would
like
to
offer
the
court
an
alternative.
and
this
is
in
the
area
of
the
case
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
we
are
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
strongly
feel
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
an
absolute
amendment.
it
does
have
some
limitations
based
on
reasonableness.
now
on
the
case
of
chambers
versus
maroney
which
was
written
after
the
state's
brief
was
submitted,
after
the
state’s
brief
was
printed.
this
was
a
moving
vehicle.
they
stopped
the
moving
vehicle.
they
got
out,
they
placed
the
defendant
and
his
accomplice
in
the
backseat
of
the
police
car
which
was
parked
right
behind
the
moving
vehicle
and
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
to
the
key
question.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
mr.
justice
white
analyzing
this
case,
i’ve
looked
at
a
case
of
this
court
where
there
was
not
probable
cause
that
was
the
beck
case.
and
i
feel
that
we
have
a
better
record
than
they
had
in
beck.
and
based
on
that,
i
feel
we
have
probable
cause
in
this
record
and
only
this
court
on
an
independent
determination
of
the
record
can
justify
whether
or
not
--
mr.
jack
speight
well,
unfortunately
in
probable
cause
cases,
the
issue
usually
isn’t
raised
until
we
are
somewhere
down
the
road
beyond
the
trial
level
or
beyond
any
evidentiary
hearing
level.
now,
i
know
things
beyond
the
record
of
which
we
can’t
go
into
today
that
in
my
own
mind,
at
least
i
know
that
was
probable
cause
but
over
and
above
that
what
is
in
the
record.
the
record
is
that
a
person
told
sheriff
ogburn
that
he
had
--
that
he
believed
why
he
made
the
arrest
or
performed
the
burglar.
there
was
a
general
rash
of
burglaries
in
the
area.
small
counties
being
what
they
are.
there
was
not
many
suspects
that
you
have
to
have
to
key
in
on.
you
can
usually
eliminate
it
down
to
one
or
two.
in
this
case,
they
eliminated
it
down
to
one
or
two
and
of
course
as
justice
black
said
there
was
the
counter
band,
there
were
his
finger
prints.
there
were
his
accomplice’s
words
in
the
record.
all
before
the
illegally
seized
evidence
was
introduced
in
the
testimony.
and
it’s
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
as
the
draper
case
said
probability
is
that
there
was
probable
cause.
an
rpm
standard
could
be
applied
to
this
case
and
a
law
enforcement
officer
could
make
the
arrest.
mr.
jack
speight
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
this
again
goes
into
a
whole
new
realm
of
jurisprudence
of
what
can
be
waived
and
what
cannot.
but
at
this
late
date,
it
certainly
puts
a
handicap
on
law
enforcement
and
those
are
on
behalf
of
law
enforcement
to
reconstruct
something
that
we
don’t
have
an
opportunity
to
make
an
evidentiary
record
on.
if
this
court
is
inclined
in
this
area,
give
us
one
shot
of
an
evidentiary
record
back
in
federal
court
we’ll
get
chuck
ogburn
understand,
we’ll
get
judge
castle
jp
understand,
then
we’ll
develop
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
what
went
through
their
minds.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir,
he
--
there
are
several
area.
mr.
jack
speight
it
was
about
--
mr.
jack
speight
mr.
justice
white
it
was
about
a
days
trial,
little
over
days
trial
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
might
add,
i
get
very
competent
counsel
at
the
trial
level.
the
facts
have
changed.
the
law
has
changed
since
‘64.
this
is
really
what
we’re
talking
about.
and
we
get
in
the
final
analysis,
if
we
set
through
fascinating
argument
yesterday
on
the
civil
liability
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
i
think
this
is
what
we’re
--
we’ve
got
to
keep
our
eye
on
the
rabbit.
if
we’re
going
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
individual
which
is
imperative
that
we
do
that
we
not
isolate
an
arrest
because
when
you
look
at
the
whole
spectrum
of
criminal
law,
we
are
talking
beyond
the
arrest,
we’re
talking
of
preliminary
hearing,
we’re
talking
about
trial
and
with
the
(inaudible)
at
this
court
in
the
last
three
or
four
years,
due
process
is
provided
to
defendant
and
we
can
isolate
the
arrest
from
the
trial.
at
least
i
can
in
my
rules
and
that
if
really
we
feel
that
people
are
being
arbitrary
law
enforcement
officer,
being
arbitrary
in
the
final
analysis
when
civil
liabilities
–
tort
liabilities
are
filed
against
false
arrest,
this
will
make
the
leaders
out.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
mr.
jack
speight
no.
mr.
jack
speight
i
think
probable
cause
means
little
more
than
a
gut
suspicion
if
you
will
sir
and
so
on
and
so
--
mr.
jack
speight
no,
it’s
not
much
but
in
my
mind
--
mr.
jack
speight
a
quantum
enough
to
meet
probable
cause.
mr.
jack
speight
i
say
that
--
mr.
jack
speight
my
question
then
would
be
what
more
is
really
needed
and
i
guess
that’s
my
word
here.
mr.
jack
speight
well
this
maybe
deviating
a
little
but
i
hope
we
haven’t’
gotten
to
the
point
that
we
can’t
--
we
cannot
–-
that
we’ve
tied
the
hands
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
so
we
can’t
go
in
and
make
investigative
type
discussions.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
after
10:00,
so
reveals
the
record.
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
well,
it
depends
on
what
was
in
the
call
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
speight
but
i
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
jack
speight
well,
i
think
the
hypothetical
goes
beyond
that,
it
can
be
anonymous
call
sheriff,
harold
whiteley
just
did
something.
sheriff,
harold
whiteley
did
something--
mr.
jack
speight
that’s
right,
that’s
right
it
is
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
i
don’t.
i’m
saying
the
record
that
is
before
this
court,
i’m
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
after
reading
the
record
that
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
no.
that’s
beyond
that.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
that’s
beyond
it.
when
you
--
when
you
detail
a
man
with
particularly
the
type
of
the
car
he
was
driving
or
what
will
be
in
the
trunk
of
that
car
that
to
me
is
probable
cause.
mr.
jack
speight
yes,
it
certainly
does.
in
the
sheriff’s
subjective
analysis
and
unfortunately
at
this
point
of
our
records
to
avoid
of
this
but
we
have
--
we
can
speculate
from
the
record
that
this
is
what
happened.
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
no,
there
wasn’t
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
if
i
can
address
myself
to
this
point.
when
we
were
in
judge
kerr’s
court
mr.
chief
justice,
we
had
six
issues
before
us.
of
the
six,
i
think
in
all
fairness
both
counsel
and
i
put
that
somewhere
down
the
priority
scale.
we
were
more
concerned
with
being
tried
for
double
jeopardy
and
this
several
other
legal
issues
which
we
spent
great
time
in
oral
argument
and
secondly
there
was
limitation
of
time
and
we
were
really
acting
in
reliance
upon
lower
court
decision
and
upon
this
court's
decision
as
to
probable
cause.
and
judge
kerr
bought
this,
he
put
it
in
a
specific
finding
in
his
record
which
he
does
a
nice
job
at
on
page
81,
judge
hickey
picks
this
up
of
page
91
of
his
appellate
brief.
and
if
there
was
error
involved
here,
it
was
on
the
states
acting
in
reliance
upon
prior
supreme
court
decisions
that
we
felt
in
our
mind
that
was
probable
cause.
if
this
would
have
been
the
only
issue
before
judge
kerr
and
this
what
have
sunk
or
floated
our
lawsuit.
i
can
guarantee
we
have
to
develop
a
record
at
that
stage.
but
quite
frankly
i
didn’t
feel
that
it
was
that
an
important
of
an
issue
of
some
other
issues
that
had
been
on
this
case.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
he
is
sir.
mr.
jack
speight
yes
he
does
sir.
there’s
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
their
attention.
