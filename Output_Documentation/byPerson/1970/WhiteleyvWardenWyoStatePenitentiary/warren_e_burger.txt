chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
owhiteley
against
the
warden
of
wyoming
state
penitentiary.
mr.
knudsen
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
he
tried
originally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
make
that
argument
if
is
ogburn,
the
sheriff
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
carbon
county,
if
ogburn
in
fact
have
probable
cause
independent
to
this
warrant,
lay
aside
the
warrant.
if
ogburn
had
no
warrant
at
all
but
had
information
which
would
constitute
probable
cause
for
the
arrest,
would
you
say
then
ogburn
could
arrest
him,
personally?
i
suppose,
the
answer
to
that
must
be
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’ll
go
back
to
my
hypothetical,
if
in
fact
sheriff
ogburn
had
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
personally,
do
you
say
he
could
not
delegate
that
to
someone
via
the
state
wide
radio
network
of
the
police?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
point
is
that
even
if
he
had
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
without
a
warrant,
having
one
side
of
warrant
then
it
stands
or
falls
on
the
technical
infirmities
of
that
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
you
make
both
arguments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
petitioner
ask
for
the
disclosure
of
the
informant’s
name?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
one
practical
reason
is
that
the
information
having
turned
out
to
be
correct,
it
did
occur
to
that
it
was
very
useful
to
challenge
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
he
represented
by
counsel
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
co-defendant
testified
and
adversely
doing
it,
didn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
said
that
they
have
done
the
robbery
together?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
speight.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
the
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
really
aren’t
concerned
what
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
this
theory
was
--
we
want
to
know
what
the
facts
are
just
hold
it
a
minute
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
probable
cause
that
sheriff
ogburn
had
on
which
he
could
have
arrested
this
man
that
he
saw
him
driving
down
the
street,
that’s
what
we
want
to
know.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
he
have
the
information
that
he
included
in
the
arrest
warrant?
he
had
that
in
the
application?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
defendant
did
not
ask
or
cross
examine
and
undertake
to
find
out
where
he
got
the
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
mr.
speight
doesn’t
the
case
has
come
down
to
this
that
if
sheriff
ogburn
had
probable
cause
to
arrest,
he
can
authorize
anybody
in
the
united
states
to
make
the
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
didn’t
have
probable
cause,
he
hasn’t
any
authority
to
give
to
anybody.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you
are
trying
to
tell
us
is
brief,
in
a
nutshell,
how
and
why
sheriff
ogburn
could
have
arrested
this
man,
whiteley
if
the
sheriff
upon
looking
out
the
window
of
his
office
saw
whiteley
standing
on
the
street
corner.
that
is
after
whiteley
got
the
information
that
he
received
for
the
application
for
warrant.
you
have
to
say
that
ogburn
could
have
gone
out
on
the
street
corner
and
arrested
him.
now
what
is
the
basis
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
take
the
position
that
if
he
wanted
to
challenge
the
informant
that
was
the
burden
of
whiteley
at
the
time
of
the
trial
to
insist
upon
protection
of
that
informant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
he
waived
that
right
by
not
moving.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
even
though
it’s
a
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
were
before
judge
kerr
in
the
federal
court
on
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
was
there
any
question
raised
about
the
identity
of
the
informant’s
in
an
occasion
to
go
in
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
what
you’re
saying
now
that
you
would
like
an
opportunity
to
please
go
back
before
judge
kerr
and
have
the
sheriff
try
to
elude
that
the
informant
was
a
man
whom
he
trusted
and
who
gave
him
detailed
information
and
i’ll
put
that
in
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
knudsen,
i
observed
in
here,
in
the
record
that
this
man
had
served
six
penitentiary
sentences
for
various
things
and
that
his
prior
convictions
are
what
led
to
life
sentences
and
habitual
criminal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
as
a
practical
matter,
that
explains
why
the
case
is
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
many
convictions
does
that
take
--
how
many
prior?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
speight
argued
among
other
things
that
when
this
issue
was
up,
it
was
not
challenged
and
that
therefore
you
have
waived
the
infirmities
and
probable
cause
by
not
pursuing
–
this
is
not
mine
--
i’m
not
advancing
that,
i’m
asking
you
to
respond
to
that
argument.
if
you
have
waived
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
absence
of
a
motion
to
suppress
has
deprived
the
trial
court
right
from
the
beginning
of
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
this
question
at
the
time
when
it
could
have
been
passed
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
might
have
added
that
you
will
find
the
stolen
coins
--[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.

you
gentlemen.
