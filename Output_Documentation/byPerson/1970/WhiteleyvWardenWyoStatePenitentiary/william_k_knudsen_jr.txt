mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
started
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
wyoming
in
november
1967
where
petitioner’s
claims
were
rejected.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
affirmed.
the
pertinent
history
of
the
state
court
proceeding
begins
with
whiteley’s
arrest
in
november
1964
and
is
being
charged
in
two
counts,
breaking
and
entering
and
being
an
habitual
criminal.
the
petition
was
tried
in
carbon
county,
wyoming
by
a
jury
in
may
1965
and
convicted
on
both
counts.
he
was
sentenced
one
to
10
years
on
the
first
count
and
for
life
imprisonment
on
the
second,
both
counts
to
run
concurrently.
whiteley
appealed
this
conviction
to
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
which
affirmed
the
judgment
below.
in
the
united
states
district
court
below
when
the
party
stipulated
to
try
the
case
on
both
the
record
in
the
trial
court
in
these
original
criminal
proceedings
number
2885
and
on
the
record
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
probable
cause
existed
for
petitioner’s
arrest.
if
not,
a
surge
incident
to
this
arrest
was
illegal
and
invalid
and
the
fruits
thereof
could
not
be
used
at
his
trial
as
they
were.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
was
tried
in
may
1965
your
honor.
the
pertinent
facts
are
as
follows:
on
november
23,
1964
several
business
establishments
are
broken
into
in
a
small
town
of
saratoga,
wyoming.
the
next
day,
the
sheriff
of
carbon
county
acting
on
a
tip
from
an
unnamed
and
unidentified
informant
executed
a
complaint
or
affidavit
on
a
basis
of
which
an
arrest
warrant
was
sought
and
was
issued.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
would
like
to
read
the
pertinent
parts
of
this
complaint
since
petitioner’s
case
in
large
part
is
based
on
a
two
alleged
defects
contained
there
in.
this
complaint
appears
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well
your
honor
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
three
courts
below
have
surprised
me
by
ruling
that
at
the
--
there
was
probable
cause
for
a
warrantless
arrest.
and
i
would
like
to
address
that
question
in
a
moment
sir.
i
think
the
case
rises
or
falls
on
this
affidavit
but
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming,
the
united
states
district
court
for
wyoming
in
the
tenth
circuit
have
all
argued
that
this
was
a
warrantless
arrest
based
on
probable
cause.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
they
didn’t
seem
to
discuss
it
your
honor
and
i
take
it
that
they
felt
that
it
was
defective
and
there
were
other
grounds
for
the
warrantless
arrest.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
we
would
not.
you
see
your
honor,
first
we
have
the
affidavit
which
was
defective
and
then
we
have
the
warrant
of
arrest
which
i
say
was
defective
because
the
affidavit
was
defective.
this
warrant
of
arrest
was
put
on
a
statewide
broadcast
to
all
law
enforcement
agencies
requesting
them
to
arrest
whiteley
on
site.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
so
you
might
go
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
i
probably
would
because
i’d
say
the
warrantless
arrest
like
probable
cause
and
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
hope
so.
the
affidavit
on
behalf
of
the
arrest
warrant
reads
as
follows:
i
see
w.
ogburn
to
solemnly
swear
that
on
or
about
the
23rd
day
of
november
1964
in
the
county
of
carbon
in
the
state
of
wyoming,
the
said
harold
whiteley
and
jeff
daley,
defendants,
did
then
and
there
unlawfully
break
and
entered
a
lock
and
sealed
building,
stars
showing
in
matter
that
has
been
excluded
as
unnecessary
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
pardon.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
that’s
right,
yeah.
contrary
to
the
form
of
the
statute
in
such
case
made
and
provided
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state
of
wyoming,
now
that
is
the
affidavit.
now,
the
warrant
of
arrest
was
issued
and
a
statewide
broadcast
made
to
all
law
enforcement
agencies
on
the
basis
of
this
arrest
warrant
and
nothing
else.
that
very
night,
petitioner
was
arrested
by
police
officers
of
the
city
of
laramie
which
is
the
largest
city
in
the
adjoining
county,
albany
county
and
they
arrested
whiteley
with
a
deputy
sheriff
of
albany
county.
and
now
we
come
to
what
i
think
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
this
arrest
was
made
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
statewide
broadcast.
neither
the
laramie
police
nor
the
albany
county
deputy
sheriff
had
any
reason
to
arrest
whiteley
other
than
the
broadcast.
and
the
reason
that
this
is
so
important
is
that
these
three
courts
below
had
previously
passed
on
this
very
issue
namely
the
wyoming
supreme
court,
the
us
district
court
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
each
court
has
made
what
i
consider
the
same
error
that
despite
the
fact
that
an
arrest
warrant
had
been
used,
the
arrest
was
valid
as
a
warrantless
arrest
on
the
ground
that
the
arresting
officers
had
probable
cause.
and
they
find
this
probable
cause
because
they
were
told
by
another
law
enforcement
agency
to
arrest
them.
now,
i
think
this
must
be
emphasized.
the
arresting
officers
had
no
independent
knowledge
of
any
facts
concerning
the
crime.
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
key
question
before
this
court
is
not
whether
an
arrest
based
on
an
invalid
arrest
warrant
may
still
be
valid
if
efficient
probable
cause
exists
to
support
a
warrantless
arrest
rather,
the
crucial
issue
here
is
whether
an
arrest
based
on
an
invalid
arrest
warrant
and
without
any
independent
ground
on
the
part
of
the
arresting
officer
to
support
a
warantless
arrest
is
valid.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
of
carbon
county.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
guess
the
answer
is
yes,
so
i
kind
of
lean
your
honor
to
the
fact,
to
the
rule
that
if
you
seek
out
an
arrest
warrant
and
you
don’t
do
it
properly,
all
bets
are
off,
that’s
the
end
of
it.
but
i
know
the
lower
courts
in
this
country
have
held
that
if
the
arrest
warrant
is
invalid
but
there
still
remains
probable
cause
for
a
warrantless
arrest,
that
is
good.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
if
he
had
probable
cause
he
certainly
could
delegate
that.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well,
i
go
beyond
that
your
honor.
i
say
that
but
i
also
say
that
he
did
not
have
probable
cause.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
i
say
that
he
did
not
have
probable
cause.
now,
i
say
another
way
of
putting
this
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
i
think
and
under
those
circumstances,
yes,
if
he
had
actually
seen
them.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
your
honor
here,
there’s
no
information,
whatsoever
other
than
this
anonymous
tip.
we
have
no
underlying
circumstances.
i’m
coming
now
to
the
affidavit
and
there
are
no
underlying
circumstances
to
show
that
whiteley
had
anything
to
do
with
the
crime,
that’s
aguilar
and
spinelli
and
giordenello
and
secondly,
there
were
no
underlying
facts
set
forth
to
show
that
the
informant
was
reliable.
in
fact,
ogburn
didn’t
even
show
that
there
was
an
informant
in
the
affidavit.
it
was
only
at
the
trial
when
defense
counsel
asked
him
how
he
got
this
information.
he
said
i
got
it
from
a
tip.
and
then
the
defense
counsel
didn’t
follow
it
up
and
it
remained
that
way.
so
a
non-identified
informant
gave
him
this
information.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
affidavit
that
there
was
an
informant
but
disappears
at
the
trial.
he
was
unidentified.
there
is
no
statement
about
his
reliability
in
the
affidavit
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
in
the
record.
and
the
underlying
facts
with
respect
to
the
crime
under
aguilar,
giordenello
and
spinelli
do
not
exist.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
he
did
not
your
honor.
i
don’t’
know
why.
this
was
tried
several
years
before
i
came
to
wyoming
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
that
might
have
been
a
tactic.
but
or
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
assigned
counsel.
i
submit
your
honors
that
another
way
of
putting
this
is
whether
an
invalid
arrest
warrant
can
be
validated
by
airing
it
on
a
broadcast
to
other
law
enforcement
agencies.
i
think
the
case
is
that
simple.
i
think
that
the
courts
below
have
gotten
confused,
starting
out
with
the
wyoming
supreme
court
which
held
that
this
was
a
good
warrantless
arrest
because
the
police
officer
in
laramie
had
been
told
to
arrest
them
by
the
sheriff
of
carbon
county.
and
i
do
not
see
how
an
arrest
warrant
that
is
bad
can
be
validated
by
putting
it
on
the
air.
it
is
absolutely
nothing.
i
want
to
make
this
very
clear
to
the
court.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
is
any
probable
cause
here
that
the
sheriff
had
which
he
did
not
disclose
to
the
magistrate.
the
record
is
barren
on
that
point.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
feel
your
honor,
in
fact
i
say
that
in
my
brief
that
ogburn
who
was
the
affiant
could
not
have
arrested
him
on
the
basis
of
his
information
because
it
was
based
on
a
non-identified
informant
not
proven
to
be
reliable.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
in
fact
it’s
kind
of
like
mr.
blackmun’s
domino
theory,
i
don’t
want
to
describe
that
to
you
sir
but
since
the
affidavit
was
bad,
the
arrest
warrant
was
bad,
anything
done
pursuant
to
that
arrest
warrant
was
bad
by
anyone
including
ogburn.
and
i
think
this
is
the
case.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
was
charged
with
breaking
and
entering
and
the
habitual
--
violation
of
the
habitual
criminal
statute
in
wyoming.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
was
charged
with
breaking
and
entering
shively’s
hardware
store.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
but
i
don’t
make
an
issue
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
oh,
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes.
i
did
not
because
i
felt
that
both
affidavits
were
equally
defective.
the
first
one
had
to
do
with
another
man’s
store
across
the
street.
and
then
the
second
one
which
had
to
do
with
shively’s
hardware,
i
think
they
are
equally
defective.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
it
was
an
affidavit
after
he
was
arrested,
at
least
i’m
pretty
sure
it
was
an
affidavit
and
which
was
made
after
the
arrest
and
this
was
the
basis
for
the
further
proceedings.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
the
search
was
of
whiteley’s
car.
he
was
put
in
the
police's
car
which
was
behind
his
car
and
they
searched
the
trunk
and
the
inside
of
the
car
and
found
incriminating
evidence.
i
do
not
say
that
the
search
was
invalid
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
they
found
burglars
tools
and
they
found
coins.
the
shively
was
a
collector
of
old
coins
and
they
found
many
of
these
coins
in
the
car.
and
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
they
had
been
in
the
hardware
store,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no
doubt
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
whiteley?
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
he
testified.
and
he
said
that
he
had
not
done
it
that
his
compatriot
had
had
the
car
the
night
before
and
he
had
—
didn’t
know
what
had
happened.
and
his
compatriot
said
they
both
had
done
it.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
that’s
what
he
says
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
did.
and
whiteley
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
did.
a
moment
ago,
i
said
i
didn’t
make
any
contention
about
the
search.
if
the
arrest
was
lawful,
i
do
not
make
any
contention
about
the
search.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful
and
as
a
consequence,
the
search
was
unlawful
because
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
yes.
but
if
the
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well,
first
of
all
i
would
say
that
daley’s
testimony
is
fruit
of
a
poisonous
tree,
that
was
his
co-defendant.
and
that
would
certainly
be
enough
to
reverse
this
case.
but
if
they
convicted
him
solely
on
other
information
or
other
data
that
they
found
at
the
scene
and
not
on
daley’s
testimony
and
not
on
anything
they
found
on
the
car
then
i
would
say
this
whole
case
would
not
be
here.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yeah,
it
certainly
did
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
your
honor,
with
the
burglar
tools,
with
the
coins
which
came
from
shively’s
hardware,
with
daley
testifying,
i
think
this
case
falls
in
the
aguilar,
spinelli
etcetera
cases
that
there
was
absolutely
no
harmless
error
here.
when
the
jury
were
faced
with
these
facts.
the
coins
which
shively
had
been
saving
for
years
and
daley
said,
this
fellow
sitting
here
committed
the
crime
with
me,
i
don’t
see,
i
don’t
think
we
confine
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
presumed
he
plead
that
he
was
not
tried
with
whiteley.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor.
we
in
a
defender
aid
program
like
to
get
involved
in
naughty
questions
but
we
don’t
take
merely
academic
questions.
if
whiteley
had
been
released
two
years
ago
and
so
i
don’t
think
we’d
be
here
today.
but
it’s
mandatory.
the
life
sentence
is
mandatory
in
wyoming
if
you
are
convicted
as
an
habitual
criminal.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
it
takes
three
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
had
more
than
three.
i
--
may
i
proceed
your
honor?
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
here.
i
think
in
the
heat
of
the
argument
my
good
friend
jack
speight
said
something
which
is
not
completely
accurate
on
the
fingerprints.
on
page
54
of
the
appendix
ogburn
was
asked
if
he
had
taken
any
fingerprints
and
he
said
no.
he
couldn’t
get
any
fingerprints
of
any
kind
and
i
just
think
that
was
one
of
the
things
made
the
heat
of
the
battle.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
draper
point
if
i
may.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
anything
except
that
there
was
a
tip,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
tipster
told
ogburn
that
he
saw
that
he
recognized
a
man
with
a
tattoo
on
his
arm
and
so
on.
all
we
have
is
that
the
tipster
told
him,
whiteley
did
it,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
in
the
absence
of
this
information.
the
absence
of
this
on
the
record,
i
think
we
must
make
the
assumption
that
then
ogburn
said,
“well
i
know,
i
know
whiteley
well,
he
is
six
feet
tall,
he’s
47
years
old,”
etcetera,
etcetera,
and
he
put
this
out.
now
i
say
i’m
making
an
assumption.
but
i
think
the
other
assumption
is
equally
bad
to
say
that
the
tipster
gave
them
this
information
about
whiteley.
we
don’t
know
and
i
say
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
therefore
they
haven’t’
proven
it.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
don’t
think
there
was
a
waive.
you
mean
in
the
original
proceeding
number
2885
once
the
--
attorney
for
whiteley
said,
“how
did
you
get
this
information?””
and
he
said,
“i
got
if
from
a
tip.”
he
should
have
pursued
it.
i
--
each
attorney
practices
differently.
i
think
i
would
have
pursued
it.
in
fact,
i
would
have
probably
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
first
place.
but
once
this
occurred
i
would
have
gone
into
it
to
find
out
where
he
got
it,
who
the
informant
was,
ask
the
court
to
make
him
tell
us
who
the
informant
was,
was
he
reliable,
etcetera,
etcetera.
this
did
not
occur.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor
but
i
think
that
if
a
lawyer
does
fail
to
move
to
suppress
that
he
perhaps
can
raise
this
at
the
trial
level
with
the
court’s
permission.
i
know
some
courts,
i
was
a
u.s.
attorney
once,
assistant
u.s.
attorney
at
one
time
and
on
occasion
i
would
have
fit
when
the
judge
would
permit
this
at
the
trial
when
the
no
motion
to
suppress
had
been
made.
and
i
think
here,
it
could
have
been
raised
at
the
trial
if
the
court
permitted
and
he
permitted
those
questions
was
how
did
you
get
the
information?
i
got
if
from
a
tip.
and
then
the
whole
thing
died
and
they
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
there
was
an
objection
to
the
evidence,
yes.
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
believe
so
your
honor.
the
rules
were
changed
and
i
actually
never
tried
any
cases
in
wyoming
but
--
nothing,
there
was
no
objection
by
the
county
attorney
to
the
objection
by
the
defense
attorney.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
right,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
once
he
asked
him
if
it
came
out
by
a
tip,
the
matter
was
just
dropped.
nothing
else
was
asked.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
at
that
point
the
county
attorney
then
has
to
say
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
if
i
had
been
the
county
attorney
then
i
would
have
certainly
proven
that
there
was
a
reliable
informant
etcetera.
i
would
like
to
say
just
on
this
draper
question
that
i
have
set
it
forth
in
my
reply
brief
but
two
things
about
draper:
one,
draper
was
a
reliable
informant.
we
had
a
reliable
informant
there.
we
do
not
have
that
here
and
i
think
for
that
reason
draper
falls.
secondly,
in
the
spinelli
case,
mr.
justice
harlan
says
and
i’m
quoting
from
page
11
that
it
is
especially
important
that
the
tip
described
the
accused
criminal
activity
insufficient
detail
so
the
magistrate
may
know
that
he
is
relying
on
something
more
substantial
than
a
casual
rumor
circulated
in
the
underworld
or
an
accusation
based
merely
on
an
individual’s
general
reputation.
i
really
think
we
have
got
a
reputation
case
here
because
everybody
in
wyoming
knew
that
whiteley
was
--
had
four,
five
convictions.
and
i
think
what’s
done
him
in.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
oh
yes,
i
don’t
say
that
sheriff
was
perjuring
himself.
i’m
sure
somebody
told
the
sheriff,
maybe
whiteley
was
in
saratoga.
i
think
that
would
be
enough
in
saratoga,
small
town
of
2000
people.
if
a
burglary
occurred,
whiteley
was
there,
that
might
be
planning.
in
fact,
i
don’t
know
but
i
would
assume
that’s
just
what
happened.
and
then
ogburn
went
back
and
said
let’s
see,
whiteley
is
six
feet
tall,
has
a
tattoo
on
his
left
arm,
graying
hair
etcetera,
etcetera
and
he
put
this
out
on
the
radio
broadcast.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i’m
sure
that
that
was
added
your
honor.
one
final
point,
we
stipulated
to
the
record
in
this
case
at
the
lower
court,
admittedly
there
were
other
questions.
this
question
always
was
in
the
case.
we
had
questions
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
and
so
on
and
judge
kerr
was
more
interested
in
those.
but
this
question
was
in
the
case
and
he
adopted
the
wyoming
supreme
court
attitude
or
decision
on
it
and
so
the
defense
circuit.
but
if
this
court
should
feel
that
a
reversal
is
proper,
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
to
have
another
hearing.
we
had
our
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing.
we
stipulated
to
the
facts.
whiteley
has
been
in
jail
since
november
24,
1964.
i
think
that
he
should
have
been
dismissed.
and
in
1965
at
the
trial
or
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
--
motion
to
suppress
and
i
don’t
think
we
should
send
this
back
when
a
man’s
liberty
has
been
handled
this
way
over
this
many
years.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
in
my
opinion
your
honor,
if
this
case
is
reversed
and
sent
back
to
rawlins,
the
county
attorney
will
have
to
see
what
evidence
he
has.
as
far
as
i
know
the
only
evidence
he
has
is
the
other
goods,
the
fruits
that
he
found
in
the
car
and
daley’s
testimony.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
should
be
ordered
to
send
--
to
order
a
new
trial
in
the
state
court.
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
oh
to
give
him
a
new
trial
or
release
him,
yes.
but
i
don’t
think
we
should
rehash
all
the
facts
in
the
district
court
again
your
honor.
as
far
as
if
we
go
back
ultimately
to
rawlins,
to
the
carbon
county
court,
i
think
the
county
attorney
has
two
things,
what
he
found
in
the
car
and
daley.
i
think
they
are
both
fruits
of
a
poisonous
tree
and
i
think
you
have
to
dismiss
it.
thank
you.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
started
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
wyoming
in
november
1967
where
petitioner’s
claims
were
rejected.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
affirmed.
the
pertinent
history
of
the
state
court
proceeding
begins
with
whiteley’s
arrest
in
november
1964
and
is
being
charged
in
two
counts,
breaking
and
entering
and
being
an
habitual
criminal.
the
petition
was
tried
in
carbon
county,
wyoming
by
a
jury
in
may
1965
and
convicted
on
both
counts.
he
was
sentenced
one
to
10
years
on
the
first
count
and
for
life
imprisonment
on
the
second,
both
counts
to
run
concurrently.
whiteley
appealed
this
conviction
to
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming
which
affirmed
the
judgment
below.
in
the
united
states
district
court
below
when
the
party
stipulated
to
try
the
case
on
both
the
record
in
the
trial
court
in
these
original
criminal
proceedings
number
2885
and
on
the
record
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
probable
cause
existed
for
petitioner’s
arrest.
if
not,
a
surge
incident
to
this
arrest
was
illegal
and
invalid
and
the
fruits
thereof
could
not
be
used
at
his
trial
as
they
were.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
was
tried
in
may
1965
your
honor.
the
pertinent
facts
are
as
follows:
on
november
23,
1964
several
business
establishments
are
broken
into
in
a
small
town
of
saratoga,
wyoming.
the
next
day,
the
sheriff
of
carbon
county
acting
on
a
tip
from
an
unnamed
and
unidentified
informant
executed
a
complaint
or
affidavit
on
a
basis
of
which
an
arrest
warrant
was
sought
and
was
issued.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
would
like
to
read
the
pertinent
parts
of
this
complaint
since
petitioner’s
case
in
large
part
is
based
on
a
two
alleged
defects
contained
there
in.
this
complaint
appears
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well
your
honor
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
three
courts
below
have
surprised
me
by
ruling
that
at
the
--
there
was
probable
cause
for
a
warrantless
arrest.
and
i
would
like
to
address
that
question
in
a
moment
sir.
i
think
the
case
rises
or
falls
on
this
affidavit
but
the
supreme
court
of
wyoming,
the
united
states
district
court
for
wyoming
in
the
tenth
circuit
have
all
argued
that
this
was
a
warrantless
arrest
based
on
probable
cause.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
they
didn’t
seem
to
discuss
it
your
honor
and
i
take
it
that
they
felt
that
it
was
defective
and
there
were
other
grounds
for
the
warrantless
arrest.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
we
would
not.
you
see
your
honor,
first
we
have
the
affidavit
which
was
defective
and
then
we
have
the
warrant
of
arrest
which
i
say
was
defective
because
the
affidavit
was
defective.
this
warrant
of
arrest
was
put
on
a
statewide
broadcast
to
all
law
enforcement
agencies
requesting
them
to
arrest
whiteley
on
site.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
so
you
might
go
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
i
probably
would
because
i’d
say
the
warrantless
arrest
like
probable
cause
and
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
hope
so.
the
affidavit
on
behalf
of
the
arrest
warrant
reads
as
follows:
i
see
w.
ogburn
to
solemnly
swear
that
on
or
about
the
23rd
day
of
november
1964
in
the
county
of
carbon
in
the
state
of
wyoming,
the
said
harold
whiteley
and
jeff
daley,
defendants,
did
then
and
there
unlawfully
break
and
entered
a
lock
and
sealed
building,
stars
showing
in
matter
that
has
been
excluded
as
unnecessary
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
pardon.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
that’s
right,
yeah.
contrary
to
the
form
of
the
statute
in
such
case
made
and
provided
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state
of
wyoming,
now
that
is
the
affidavit.
now,
the
warrant
of
arrest
was
issued
and
a
statewide
broadcast
made
to
all
law
enforcement
agencies
on
the
basis
of
this
arrest
warrant
and
nothing
else.
that
very
night,
petitioner
was
arrested
by
police
officers
of
the
city
of
laramie
which
is
the
largest
city
in
the
adjoining
county,
albany
county
and
they
arrested
whiteley
with
a
deputy
sheriff
of
albany
county.
and
now
we
come
to
what
i
think
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
this
arrest
was
made
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
statewide
broadcast.
neither
the
laramie
police
nor
the
albany
county
deputy
sheriff
had
any
reason
to
arrest
whiteley
other
than
the
broadcast.
and
the
reason
that
this
is
so
important
is
that
these
three
courts
below
had
previously
passed
on
this
very
issue
namely
the
wyoming
supreme
court,
the
us
district
court
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
each
court
has
made
what
i
consider
the
same
error
that
despite
the
fact
that
an
arrest
warrant
had
been
used,
the
arrest
was
valid
as
a
warrantless
arrest
on
the
ground
that
the
arresting
officers
had
probable
cause.
and
they
find
this
probable
cause
because
they
were
told
by
another
law
enforcement
agency
to
arrest
them.
now,
i
think
this
must
be
emphasized.
the
arresting
officers
had
no
independent
knowledge
of
any
facts
concerning
the
crime.
therefore,
i
submit
that
the
key
question
before
this
court
is
not
whether
an
arrest
based
on
an
invalid
arrest
warrant
may
still
be
valid
if
efficient
probable
cause
exists
to
support
a
warrantless
arrest
rather,
the
crucial
issue
here
is
whether
an
arrest
based
on
an
invalid
arrest
warrant
and
without
any
independent
ground
on
the
part
of
the
arresting
officer
to
support
a
warantless
arrest
is
valid.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
of
carbon
county.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
guess
the
answer
is
yes,
so
i
kind
of
lean
your
honor
to
the
fact,
to
the
rule
that
if
you
seek
out
an
arrest
warrant
and
you
don’t
do
it
properly,
all
bets
are
off,
that’s
the
end
of
it.
but
i
know
the
lower
courts
in
this
country
have
held
that
if
the
arrest
warrant
is
invalid
but
there
still
remains
probable
cause
for
a
warrantless
arrest,
that
is
good.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
if
he
had
probable
cause
he
certainly
could
delegate
that.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well,
i
go
beyond
that
your
honor.
i
say
that
but
i
also
say
that
he
did
not
have
probable
cause.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
i
say
that
he
did
not
have
probable
cause.
now,
i
say
another
way
of
putting
this
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
i
think
and
under
those
circumstances,
yes,
if
he
had
actually
seen
them.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
your
honor
here,
there’s
no
information,
whatsoever
other
than
this
anonymous
tip.
we
have
no
underlying
circumstances.
i’m
coming
now
to
the
affidavit
and
there
are
no
underlying
circumstances
to
show
that
whiteley
had
anything
to
do
with
the
crime,
that’s
aguilar
and
spinelli
and
giordenello
and
secondly,
there
were
no
underlying
facts
set
forth
to
show
that
the
informant
was
reliable.
in
fact,
ogburn
didn’t
even
show
that
there
was
an
informant
in
the
affidavit.
it
was
only
at
the
trial
when
defense
counsel
asked
him
how
he
got
this
information.
he
said
i
got
it
from
a
tip.
and
then
the
defense
counsel
didn’t
follow
it
up
and
it
remained
that
way.
so
a
non-identified
informant
gave
him
this
information.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
affidavit
that
there
was
an
informant
but
disappears
at
the
trial.
he
was
unidentified.
there
is
no
statement
about
his
reliability
in
the
affidavit
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
in
the
record.
and
the
underlying
facts
with
respect
to
the
crime
under
aguilar,
giordenello
and
spinelli
do
not
exist.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
he
did
not
your
honor.
i
don’t’
know
why.
this
was
tried
several
years
before
i
came
to
wyoming
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
that
might
have
been
a
tactic.
but
or
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
assigned
counsel.
i
submit
your
honors
that
another
way
of
putting
this
is
whether
an
invalid
arrest
warrant
can
be
validated
by
airing
it
on
a
broadcast
to
other
law
enforcement
agencies.
i
think
the
case
is
that
simple.
i
think
that
the
courts
below
have
gotten
confused,
starting
out
with
the
wyoming
supreme
court
which
held
that
this
was
a
good
warrantless
arrest
because
the
police
officer
in
laramie
had
been
told
to
arrest
them
by
the
sheriff
of
carbon
county.
and
i
do
not
see
how
an
arrest
warrant
that
is
bad
can
be
validated
by
putting
it
on
the
air.
it
is
absolutely
nothing.
i
want
to
make
this
very
clear
to
the
court.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
is
any
probable
cause
here
that
the
sheriff
had
which
he
did
not
disclose
to
the
magistrate.
the
record
is
barren
on
that
point.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
feel
your
honor,
in
fact
i
say
that
in
my
brief
that
ogburn
who
was
the
affiant
could
not
have
arrested
him
on
the
basis
of
his
information
because
it
was
based
on
a
non-identified
informant
not
proven
to
be
reliable.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
in
fact
it’s
kind
of
like
mr.
blackmun’s
domino
theory,
i
don’t
want
to
describe
that
to
you
sir
but
since
the
affidavit
was
bad,
the
arrest
warrant
was
bad,
anything
done
pursuant
to
that
arrest
warrant
was
bad
by
anyone
including
ogburn.
and
i
think
this
is
the
case.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
was
charged
with
breaking
and
entering
and
the
habitual
--
violation
of
the
habitual
criminal
statute
in
wyoming.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
was
charged
with
breaking
and
entering
shively’s
hardware
store.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
but
i
don’t
make
an
issue
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
oh,
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes.
i
did
not
because
i
felt
that
both
affidavits
were
equally
defective.
the
first
one
had
to
do
with
another
man’s
store
across
the
street.
and
then
the
second
one
which
had
to
do
with
shively’s
hardware,
i
think
they
are
equally
defective.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no,
it
was
an
affidavit
after
he
was
arrested,
at
least
i’m
pretty
sure
it
was
an
affidavit
and
which
was
made
after
the
arrest
and
this
was
the
basis
for
the
further
proceedings.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
the
search
was
of
whiteley’s
car.
he
was
put
in
the
police's
car
which
was
behind
his
car
and
they
searched
the
trunk
and
the
inside
of
the
car
and
found
incriminating
evidence.
i
do
not
say
that
the
search
was
invalid
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
they
found
burglars
tools
and
they
found
coins.
the
shively
was
a
collector
of
old
coins
and
they
found
many
of
these
coins
in
the
car.
and
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
they
had
been
in
the
hardware
store,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no
doubt
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
whiteley?
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes,
he
testified.
and
he
said
that
he
had
not
done
it
that
his
compatriot
had
had
the
car
the
night
before
and
he
had
—
didn’t
know
what
had
happened.
and
his
compatriot
said
they
both
had
done
it.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
that’s
what
he
says
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
did.
and
whiteley
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
did.
a
moment
ago,
i
said
i
didn’t
make
any
contention
about
the
search.
if
the
arrest
was
lawful,
i
do
not
make
any
contention
about
the
search.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
no
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful
and
as
a
consequence,
the
search
was
unlawful
because
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
yes.
but
if
the
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well,
first
of
all
i
would
say
that
daley’s
testimony
is
fruit
of
a
poisonous
tree,
that
was
his
co-defendant.
and
that
would
certainly
be
enough
to
reverse
this
case.
but
if
they
convicted
him
solely
on
other
information
or
other
data
that
they
found
at
the
scene
and
not
on
daley’s
testimony
and
not
on
anything
they
found
on
the
car
then
i
would
say
this
whole
case
would
not
be
here.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yeah,
it
certainly
did
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
your
honor,
with
the
burglar
tools,
with
the
coins
which
came
from
shively’s
hardware,
with
daley
testifying,
i
think
this
case
falls
in
the
aguilar,
spinelli
etcetera
cases
that
there
was
absolutely
no
harmless
error
here.
when
the
jury
were
faced
with
these
facts.
the
coins
which
shively
had
been
saving
for
years
and
daley
said,
this
fellow
sitting
here
committed
the
crime
with
me,
i
don’t
see,
i
don’t
think
we
confine
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
presumed
he
plead
that
he
was
not
tried
with
whiteley.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor.
we
in
a
defender
aid
program
like
to
get
involved
in
naughty
questions
but
we
don’t
take
merely
academic
questions.
if
whiteley
had
been
released
two
years
ago
and
so
i
don’t
think
we’d
be
here
today.
but
it’s
mandatory.
the
life
sentence
is
mandatory
in
wyoming
if
you
are
convicted
as
an
habitual
criminal.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
it
takes
three
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
he
had
more
than
three.
i
--
may
i
proceed
your
honor?
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
here.
i
think
in
the
heat
of
the
argument
my
good
friend
jack
speight
said
something
which
is
not
completely
accurate
on
the
fingerprints.
on
page
54
of
the
appendix
ogburn
was
asked
if
he
had
taken
any
fingerprints
and
he
said
no.
he
couldn’t
get
any
fingerprints
of
any
kind
and
i
just
think
that
was
one
of
the
things
made
the
heat
of
the
battle.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
draper
point
if
i
may.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
anything
except
that
there
was
a
tip,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
tipster
told
ogburn
that
he
saw
that
he
recognized
a
man
with
a
tattoo
on
his
arm
and
so
on.
all
we
have
is
that
the
tipster
told
him,
whiteley
did
it,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
in
the
absence
of
this
information.
the
absence
of
this
on
the
record,
i
think
we
must
make
the
assumption
that
then
ogburn
said,
“well
i
know,
i
know
whiteley
well,
he
is
six
feet
tall,
he’s
47
years
old,”
etcetera,
etcetera,
and
he
put
this
out.
now
i
say
i’m
making
an
assumption.
but
i
think
the
other
assumption
is
equally
bad
to
say
that
the
tipster
gave
them
this
information
about
whiteley.
we
don’t
know
and
i
say
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
therefore
they
haven’t’
proven
it.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
don’t
think
there
was
a
waive.
you
mean
in
the
original
proceeding
number
2885
once
the
--
attorney
for
whiteley
said,
“how
did
you
get
this
information?””
and
he
said,
“i
got
if
from
a
tip.”
he
should
have
pursued
it.
i
--
each
attorney
practices
differently.
i
think
i
would
have
pursued
it.
in
fact,
i
would
have
probably
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
first
place.
but
once
this
occurred
i
would
have
gone
into
it
to
find
out
where
he
got
it,
who
the
informant
was,
ask
the
court
to
make
him
tell
us
who
the
informant
was,
was
he
reliable,
etcetera,
etcetera.
this
did
not
occur.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
your
honor
but
i
think
that
if
a
lawyer
does
fail
to
move
to
suppress
that
he
perhaps
can
raise
this
at
the
trial
level
with
the
court’s
permission.
i
know
some
courts,
i
was
a
u.s.
attorney
once,
assistant
u.s.
attorney
at
one
time
and
on
occasion
i
would
have
fit
when
the
judge
would
permit
this
at
the
trial
when
the
no
motion
to
suppress
had
been
made.
and
i
think
here,
it
could
have
been
raised
at
the
trial
if
the
court
permitted
and
he
permitted
those
questions
was
how
did
you
get
the
information?
i
got
if
from
a
tip.
and
then
the
whole
thing
died
and
they
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
yes
there
was
an
objection
to
the
evidence,
yes.
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
believe
so
your
honor.
the
rules
were
changed
and
i
actually
never
tried
any
cases
in
wyoming
but
--
nothing,
there
was
no
objection
by
the
county
attorney
to
the
objection
by
the
defense
attorney.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
right,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
once
he
asked
him
if
it
came
out
by
a
tip,
the
matter
was
just
dropped.
nothing
else
was
asked.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
at
that
point
the
county
attorney
then
has
to
say
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
if
i
had
been
the
county
attorney
then
i
would
have
certainly
proven
that
there
was
a
reliable
informant
etcetera.
i
would
like
to
say
just
on
this
draper
question
that
i
have
set
it
forth
in
my
reply
brief
but
two
things
about
draper:
one,
draper
was
a
reliable
informant.
we
had
a
reliable
informant
there.
we
do
not
have
that
here
and
i
think
for
that
reason
draper
falls.
secondly,
in
the
spinelli
case,
mr.
justice
harlan
says
and
i’m
quoting
from
page
11
that
it
is
especially
important
that
the
tip
described
the
accused
criminal
activity
insufficient
detail
so
the
magistrate
may
know
that
he
is
relying
on
something
more
substantial
than
a
casual
rumor
circulated
in
the
underworld
or
an
accusation
based
merely
on
an
individual’s
general
reputation.
i
really
think
we
have
got
a
reputation
case
here
because
everybody
in
wyoming
knew
that
whiteley
was
--
had
four,
five
convictions.
and
i
think
what’s
done
him
in.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
oh
yes,
i
don’t
say
that
sheriff
was
perjuring
himself.
i’m
sure
somebody
told
the
sheriff,
maybe
whiteley
was
in
saratoga.
i
think
that
would
be
enough
in
saratoga,
small
town
of
2000
people.
if
a
burglary
occurred,
whiteley
was
there,
that
might
be
planning.
in
fact,
i
don’t
know
but
i
would
assume
that’s
just
what
happened.
and
then
ogburn
went
back
and
said
let’s
see,
whiteley
is
six
feet
tall,
has
a
tattoo
on
his
left
arm,
graying
hair
etcetera,
etcetera
and
he
put
this
out
on
the
radio
broadcast.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
i’m
sure
that
that
was
added
your
honor.
one
final
point,
we
stipulated
to
the
record
in
this
case
at
the
lower
court,
admittedly
there
were
other
questions.
this
question
always
was
in
the
case.
we
had
questions
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
and
so
on
and
judge
kerr
was
more
interested
in
those.
but
this
question
was
in
the
case
and
he
adopted
the
wyoming
supreme
court
attitude
or
decision
on
it
and
so
the
defense
circuit.
but
if
this
court
should
feel
that
a
reversal
is
proper,
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
to
have
another
hearing.
we
had
our
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing.
we
stipulated
to
the
facts.
whiteley
has
been
in
jail
since
november
24,
1964.
i
think
that
he
should
have
been
dismissed.
and
in
1965
at
the
trial
or
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
--
motion
to
suppress
and
i
don’t
think
we
should
send
this
back
when
a
man’s
liberty
has
been
handled
this
way
over
this
many
years.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
in
my
opinion
your
honor,
if
this
case
is
reversed
and
sent
back
to
rawlins,
the
county
attorney
will
have
to
see
what
evidence
he
has.
as
far
as
i
know
the
only
evidence
he
has
is
the
other
goods,
the
fruits
that
he
found
in
the
car
and
daley’s
testimony.
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
should
be
ordered
to
send
--
to
order
a
new
trial
in
the
state
court.
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
william
k.
knudsen,
jr.
oh
to
give
him
a
new
trial
or
release
him,
yes.
but
i
don’t
think
we
should
rehash
all
the
facts
in
the
district
court
again
your
honor.
as
far
as
if
we
go
back
ultimately
to
rawlins,
to
the
carbon
county
court,
i
think
the
county
attorney
has
two
things,
what
he
found
in
the
car
and
daley.
i
think
they
are
both
fruits
of
a
poisonous
tree
and
i
think
you
have
to
dismiss
it.
thank
you.
