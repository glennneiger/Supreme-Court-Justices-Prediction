mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
case,
united
states
against
armour
and
general
host
corporation
that
was
here
a
year
ago,
but
became
moot
before
the
court,
but
decided.
like
that
case,
it
raises
a
question
as
to
the
impact
of
the
structural
prohibitions
of
the
great
meat
packers
antitrust
decree
of
1920
to
which
armour,
one
of
the
appellees
here
nominally,
is
one
of
the
four
meat
packer
parties.
the
decree
prohibits
armour
from
having
any
involvement
in
certain
forbidden
food
lines
other
than
meat
packing,
and
the
question
in
both
of
these
cases
essentially
the
same
has
been
whether
there
is
a
remedy
under
that
decree
for
a
take
over
of
armour
by
a
company
that
is
itself
in
the
forbidden
food
line,
as
there
would
be
incontestably
a
remedy
if
armour
were
to
acquire
such
a
forbidden
food
company.
the
general
host
case
began
in
the
beginning
of
1969
when
general
host
acquired
control
of
armour.
since
general
host
was
in
the
forbidden
food
lines,
the
government
took
the
position
and
that
the
decree
was
offended
by
general
host's
takeover
of
armour,
just
as
it
would
have
been
by
the
converse
situation.
so,
we
filed
a
petition
then
against
general
host
in
the
beginning
of
1969
in
the
district
court
which
has
had
continuing
jurisdiction
over
the
meat
packers
decree
for
the
last
10
or
12
years,
by
a
transfer
from
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
decree
was
initially
entered.
at
that
time,
we
asked
the
court
to
enter
an
order
supplemental
to
the
decree
against
general
host
which
would
make
general
host
a
party
to
the
decree
and
then
prohibit
its
acquisition
of
armour.
but
judge
hoffman,
the
district
judge,
who
is
also
the
district
judge
in
the
present,
declined
to
entertain
the
petition,
saying
that
the
decree
was
aimed
only
at
affirmative
action
by
armour
or
another
named
defendant,
and
that
therefore,
the
relationship
between
armour
and
general
host
was
perfectly
consistent
with
the
decree
as
long
is
it
was
created
by
somebody
other
than
armour,
and
as
long
as
armour
avoided
actively
dealing
in
the
forbidden
food
lines.
the
government
appealed
the
case
here
and
it
was
argued
in
march
of
1970.
in
mid
may
last
year
before
this
court
could
reach
a
decision
in
the
general
host
case,
general
host
sold
its
controlling
stock
interest
in
armour
to
greyhound
corporation,
which
is
the
appellee
in
the
present
case.
over
our
objection,
this
court
then
held
that
the
case
had
become
moot
and
ordered
that
the
government’s
petition
against
general
host
be
dismissed.
the
papers
that
were
filed
in
connection
with
that
mootness
issue
are
set
forth
in
the
separate
supplemental
appendix
in
this
case
and
we’ve
recited
some
of
the
related
facts
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
repeat
them
again
here.
following
that
action
by
this
court
last
june,
the
government
promptly
filed
the
present
petition
against
greyhound,
since
in
our
view
of
greyhound
like
general
host
has
food
interests
that
the
meat
packers
decree
forbids
armour
to
have.
judge
hoffman
promptly
dismissed
this
petition
as
well
at
the
end
of
june
after
hearing
argument
by
the
government
and
off
the
record
by
counsel
for
greyhound.
as
in
the
general
host
case,
judge
hoffman
again
held
that
he
was
powerless
to
issue
any
order
against
greyhound
unless
and
until
greyhound
actually
caused
armour
to
deal
in
forbidden
food
lines.
and
so,
he
held
that
the
government’s
petition
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
again,
we
appealed,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
here
we
are
again.
the
question
in
this
case
as
in
the
general
host
case
is
whether
an
antitrust
decree
can
affectively
keep
a
party
to
that
decree
from
becoming
involved
in
another
line
of
business
where
its
involvement
would,
in
the
view
of
the
initial
decree,
create
a
recipe
competition.
judge
hoffman
held
in
each
case
that
all
the
court
can
do
in
entering
an
antitrust
decree
is
to
tell
the
party
not
to
do
anything
itself
that
would
have
the
effect
of
involving
it
in
the
forbidden
business.
and
incidentally
to
that,
can
punish
anyone
who
actively
aids
or
abets
that
party
in
doing
what
the
decree
tells
it
not
to
do.
we
say
on
the
other
hand
that
a
structural
antitrust
decree
can
be
somewhat
more
than
that,
but
a
court
can
affectively
decree
an
absolute
prophylactic
separation
between
a
particular
named
party’s
business
and
another
line
of
business.
and
we
say
this
meat
packers
decree
has
done
that,
and
that
the
court
having
for
jurisdiction
over
the
decree
can
enter
a
supplemental
order
fashioning
a
remedy
against
an
outsider
like
greyhound
which
comes
in
to
destroy
the
structural
separation
that
we
say
is
the
heart
of
the
decree.
just
as
in
the
school
desegregation
cases
that
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief,
we
think
an
anti-trust
court
has
the
power
to
issue
a
narrow
order
directed
at
a
particular
third
party
involved
in
a
particular
situation
after
a
hearing
that
will
prohibit
that
party’s
interference
with
the
effectuation
of
the
specific
purpose
at
the
heart
of
the
decree
in
question.
with
that
introduction,
let
me
turn
now
to
a
description
of
the
corporate
relationship
that
greyhound
has
created
between
armour
and
greyhound’s
forbidden
food
operations,
and
then
point
once
again
as
i
did
last
year
to
the
explicit
language
of
the
decree
that
we
think
is
designed
specifically
to
prohibit
such
relationship
from
coming
into
existence.
some
of
these
details
have
developed
since
the
hearing
--
the
argument,
as
there
really
was,
in
the
district
court
last
june,
though
there
has
not
been
any
drastic
change
that
materially
affects
our
theory
of
the
case.
these
more
recent
occurrences
are
set
forth
either
in
our
brief
or
in
greyhound’s
brief
or
in
some
instances
in
greyhound’s
annual
report
for
1970
which
has
just
recently
come
out.
we
think,
they’re
undisputed
and
it
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
have
the
current
corporate
situation.
greyhound
at
the
time
when
general
host
first
became
involved
with
armour,
greyhound
also
was
trying
to
get
control
of
armour
in
competition
with
the
general
host,
but
general
host
went
out,
winding
up
in
early
1969
with
about
57%
of
the
stock,
but
leaving
greyhound
with
something
of
the
order
of
the
third
of
the
stock.
in
the
may
1970
transactions
that
i’ve
referred
to,
greyhound
then
bought
out
general
host,
acquiring
all
of
the
stock
that
general
host
had
had,
giving
it
then
a
total
of
about
86%
of
all
of
the
stock
of
armour.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
did
mr.
justice.
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
pleadings
last
term
and
refer
to
in
one
our
brief,
greyhound
filed
an
application
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
government
was
not
a
party
there,
filed
a
pleading
in
which
we
suggested
that
the
commission
withhold
its
action
of
approving
the
issuance
of
the
greyhound
stock
involved
in
the
general
host
transaction
until
this
court
could
decide
the
antitrust
case
which
will
determine
whether
that
acquisition
was
legal
or
not.
but
the
commission
took
the
point
of
view
that
since
the
court
had
not
yet
reached
the
decision,
there
was
not
yet
anything
suggesting
that
the
transaction
was
illegal
and
then
permit
--
the
icc
is
rather
narrow
focused
which
of
course
did
not
deal
--
the
icc’s
order
does
not
deal
with
antitrust
questions
at
all,
and
of
course,
it
has
no
power
to
immunize
this
kind
of
transaction.
the
only
really
question
there
was
whether
the
issuance
of
this
additional
stock
by
greyhound
would
be
harmful
to
greyhound’s
basic
business
as
a
common
carrier.
so,
the
commission
did
approve
it
and
would
then,
a
couple
of
hours
after
notice
was
given
of
that
approval,
this
transaction
had
been
closed
and
greyhound
was
the
owner
of
armour.
greyhound
has
made
no
secret
of
the
fact.
in
fact,
it’s
stated
again
in
its
current
annual
report
that
it
went
into
armour
initially
in
1969
with
the
encouragement
of
armour’s
then
that
is
pre
general
host
management.
as
we
understand
that
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
mr.
justice,
we
are
not
making
the
argument
in
terms
of
rule
65
(d)
of
the
civil
rules
that
greyhound
is
--
has
been
in
active
participation
in
armour
with
armour
in
doing
something
in
violation
of
the
decree.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i’m
not
sure
that
we
might
not
have
charged
that.
the
case
has
not
been
handled
along
those
lines.
i
think,
it’s
--
it
has
been
perfectly
open
to
the
government
to
proceed
that
way
in
a
sense
of
course,
it’s
easier
on
greyhound
than
calling
greyhound
before
the
court
and
suggesting
that
that
it
itself
was
in
contempt.
the
government
has
regarded
this
perfectly
adequate
remedy
to
have
an
order
against
greyhound
telling
greyhound
to
divest
itself,
and
then
and
only
then
would
the
government
proceed
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
certainly
there
are
i
think
fewer
questions
to
be
argued
about
in
that
approach
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
under
that
approach
and
i
think
it
is,
as
i
say,
easier
on
greyhound.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
mr.
justice,
though
i
think
--
i
think
it
if
the
government
could
precede
directly
against
greyhound,
i
think
it
would
follow
that
it
could
proceed
indirectly
in
this
way.
i
think
assuming
the
court
agreed
with
that,
the
government
could
say
“even
though
we
could
seek
contempt
punishment
against
greyhound,
now,
we
will
give
greyhound
another
chance
and
we
would
like
the
court
to
make
clear
what
greyhound’s
obligations
are,
and
then
and
only
then
we
proceed
against
them.”
as
we
understand
that
the
armour
stock
was
initially
owned
by
greyhound’s
subsidiary.
subsequently
at
the
end
of
1970,
greyhound
arranged
a
series
of
transactions
which
resulted
first
of
all,
in
the
acquisition
of
all
of
the
rest
of
the
--
all
of
the
minority
interest
in
greyhound
--
in
armour,
giving
greyhound
a
100%
ownership,
and
then
a
reorganization
of
the
corporate
structure
so
that
armour
is
now
a
direct
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
the
greyhound
corporation
which
we’re
told
is
the
holding
company
which
owns
greyhound’s
greatest
interest,
including
its
bus
lines,
armour,
the
food
businesses
that
we
find
offensive
to
the
decree
and
various
other
lesser
interests.
and
greyhound
has
moved
with
some
rapidity
to
integrate
armour
into
its
corporate
family.
for
example,
the
current
annual
report
of
greyhound
states
“the
various
activities
had
been
coordinated,
computer
operations,
communications,
insurance
and
banking
arrangements
for
instance.”
what
greyhound
is
deemed
to
be
marginal
or
unproductive
assets
of
armour
have
been
sold,
and
several
unprofitable
armour
operations
have
been
closed.
in
fact,
our
information
is
that
something
--
armour
facilities
accounting
for
something
like
10%,
perhaps
more
of
its
annual
sales
have
been
disposed
off
by
greyhound
during
the
period
that
its
had
that
kind
of
control
over
armour.
the
report
further
says
that
a
consolidation
of
headquarter
staffs
is
planned.
a
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
greyhound
is
now
the
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
armour,
seven
of
the
11
armour
directors
or
officers
are
directors
of
greyhound,
including
the
entire
executive
committee
of
armour.
the
three
top
officers
of
armour
are
in
greyhound’s
board
of
directors
and
so
on.
so
obviously,
greyhound’s
relationship
to
armour
is
a
good
deal
more
than
that
of
a
mere
investor
or
an
ordinary
stock
holder
as
greyhound
suggests
in
its
brief.
armour
is
run
by
greyhound
people
obviously
for
the
benefit
of
greyhound
and
its
shareholders.
and
of
course,
greyhound
has
created
this
situation
with
full
knowledge
throughout,
both
of
the
meat
packers
decree
and
of
the
government’s
interpretation
of
that
decree.
side
by
side
as
i
indicated
in
the
greyhound
corporate
complex
is
another
wholly-owned
subsidiary
called
greyhound
food
management
incorporated,
which
manages
greyhound’s
forbidden
food
interests
as
we
call
them.
these
are
basically
of
two
kinds,
one
post
houses
which
operates
a
chain
of
restaurants
and
two,
the
larger
element
of
this
something
called
prophet
foods
which
is
an
industrial
catering
business
which
sells
prepared
meals
in
schools
and
industrial
plants
and
hospitals
and
various
others
establishments.
food
management
is
also
a
very
substantial
part
of
the
greyhound
complex.
taking
--
leaving
armour
out,
it
has
an
averaged
something
of
the
order
15%
of
greyhound’s
total
sales,
or
something
like
a
$110
million
to
a
$120
million
a
year.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
i
think,
it
can
be
said
to
some
extent
of
post
houses
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
which
i
believe
of
runs
restaurants
in
bus
stations.
i
think
it
also
runs
other
restaurants.
i
don’t
think
that
can
be
said
in
anyway
of
prophet
foods
which
is
the
larger
element
to
this,
which
is
basically
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
pre-prepared
meals.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
greyhound’s
counsel
could
tell
you
a
bit
more
about
that.
i
don’t
believe
airlines.
i
haven’t
seen
any
reference
to
that.
i
think
its
plants
and
then
institutions
of
various
counties.
among
other
things,
the
same
person
is
the
chairman
of
food
management
which
operates
these
other
food
businesses.
vice
chairman
of
armour
and
the
vice
president
for
food
of
greyhound
is
one
individual,
and
food
management
of
course
sells
in
prepared
form
a
great
many
of
the
commodities
in
very
large
amounts
that
are
specified
in
the
paragraphs
of
the
meat
packers
decree
telling
armour
what
it
can’t
be
involved
in.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
specific
language
of
the
decree.
paragraph
four
says
that
the
meat
packer
defendants,
including
armour,
are
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
either
directly
or
indirectly,
engaging
in
or
carrying
on
the
manufacturing,
jobbing,
selling,
transporting,
distributing
or
otherwise,
dealing
in
these
forbidden
food
products.
and
that
same
paragraph
goes
on
to
say
that
the
corporation
defendants
are
further
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
owning
either
directly
or
indirectly
any
capital
stock
or
other
interest
whatsoever
in
any
corporation
engaged
in
those
forbidden
businesses.
paragraph
six
prohibits
armour
from
directly
or
indirectly
operating
retail
meat
markets
and
paragraph
eight
of
the
decree
has
prohibitions
on
dealing
in
fresh
milk
and
cream
which
are
comparable
to
the
other
prohibitions
in
paragraph
four.
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
this
meat
packers
decree,
of
course,
is
no
mere
historical
relic.
the
packers
have
twice
asked
the
courts,
this
court
each
time
to
lower
these
prophylactic
structural
barriers
between
the
meat
packing
business
and
the
other
food
businesses,
and
each
time
the
courts,
including
this
court
has
rejected
their
arguments
the
changed
conditions,
replacement
of
the
original
officers
and
directors
who
got
armour
and
the
other
packers
into
this
in
the
first
place
and
so
forth,
have
justified
changes
in
the
decree.
so
the
decree
has
remained
intact
through
all
these
years
and
it
was
only
11
years
ago
--
10
years
ago
that
this
court
last
considered
the
modification
question.
armour
still
the
second
largest
member
of
the
meat
packing
industry?
and
that
is
still
a
quite
highly
concentrated
industry,
though
somewhat
less
so
than
it
was
in
1920.

said
in
1932
in
the
earlier
modification
attempt,
such
great
size
carries
with
it,
an
opportunity
for
abuse
and
not
to
be
ignored
when
the
opportunity
is
proved
to
have
been
utilized
in
the
past.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
he
said
that
the
decree
absolutely
prohibited
the
forbidden
food
lines
from
being
added
to
the
meat
packing
business.
and
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
structural
barrier
was
again
in
justice
cardozo’s
words
“to
avoid
the
difficultly
of
parading
out
particular
impeditive
evils
and
requesting
them
to
undiscovered.”
in
other
words,
i
think
a
classic
case
would
be
prophylactic
kind
of
structural
insulation
of
the
parties
to
the
decree
from
other
businesses
where
it
was
considered
that
their
involvement
would
risk
anti
competitive
effects.
i
think
then
it’s
as
clear
as
it
could
be
that
the
specific
and
primary
purpose
of
the
decree,
both
based
on
its
own
language
and
on
what
this
court
and
the
district
court
has
said
over
the
years
in
interpreting
it,
but
armour
was
to
be
kept
in
perpetuity
out
of
the
food
lines
in
which
greyhound
through
its
sister
subsidiary
of
armour
food
management
is
involved.
and
this
specific
prohibition
is
what
we
say
the
acquisition
of
armour
by
greyhound
has
interfered
with.
as
i
indicated,
they
are
now
sister
subsidiary
of
the
single
holding
company
with
interlocking
managements
and
boards
of
directors
and
common
banking
arrangements
and
so
forth.
they're
obviously,
the
common
servants
of
a
single
owner,
greyhound
or
if
you
will,
but
the
stockholders
of
greyhound.
every
bit
as
much
we
think
in
practical
terms
as
if
armour
had
acquired
food
management
or
if
greyhound
now
as
it
obviously
could
were
to
merge
the
two
of
them,
and
perhaps
operate
them
as
divisions
of
a
single
corporation.
i
think
it’s
uncontested
that
both
of
those
particular
situations
would
be
literally
prohibited
by
the
decree.
moreover,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
armour
could
not
have
created
a
holding
company
itself
which
would
own
its
stock
and
then
would
have
acquired
company
such
as
food
management.
but
of
course,
that
corporate
relationship
is
the
precise
corporate
relationship
that
now
exists
by
virtue
of
greyhound’s
acquisition
and
rearrangement
of
these
corporate
structures.
so,
the
same
--
again,
the
same
economic
unit,
the
same
corporate
family
is
in
the
two
businesses,
and
we
say
that
the
decree
was
plainly
specifically
design
to
prevent
that
exact
situation
as
to
armour
from
coming
into
being
without
regard
we
say
to
who
is
active
and
who
is
passive
in
creating
the
situation.
in
fact,
we
think
it
can
be
said
that
situation
created
by
greyhound
with
respect
to
armour
puts
amour
in
a
position
where
it
can
be
said
to
be
in
literal
violation
of
the
decree.
as
i
indicated
paragraph
four
of
the
decree,
not
only
prohibits
amour
from
directly
or
indirectly
engaging
in
the
business
in
which
food
management
is
involved,
it
also
prohibits
armour
from
owning
any
interest
whatsoever
in
any
company
that
is
engaged
in
--
in
such
a
business
as
food
management,
we
think
plainly
is
--
we
think
that
the
situation,
well,
this
interlocking
situation,
the
common
ownership
is
a
situation
where
in
realistic
appreciation
of
modern
incorporate
realities
it
has
to
be
said
that
amour
does
own
an
interest
of
a
kind,
any
interest
whatsoever
in
the
business
of
its
sister
subsidiary.
any
other
approach,
we
think
tends
to
confuse
modern
corporate
realities
with
more
traditional
notions
of
ownership
by
real
individual
people
of
real
individual
things.
but
given
the
power
that
a
holding
company
like
greyhound
has
over
the
various
corporate
structures
that
it
has
chosen
to
put
within
a
system,
we
think
that
realistically,
this
has
to
be
regarded
as
a
situation
where
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
i
can’t
speak
very
authoritatively
on
that
mr.
justice
white
because
i
--
i’m
not
aware
that
specific
analysis
has
been
done.
i
think
that
--
this
is
a
conglomerate
problem
which
of
course
the
department
has
moved
into
another
areas.
we
have
not
contended
that
that
this
would
be
a
section
7
violation.
the
very
premise
of
this
case
is
that
we
don’t
need
to
show
that
it
would
be
one.
i
think
perhaps
the
nature
of
the
dealings
between
the
two
companies
and
the
magnitude
of
the
markets
might
not
be
sufficient
to
make
it
a
very
easy
section
7
case.
in
any
event,
we
say
we
don’t
need
to
cross
that
bridge
because
there’s
already
a
decree
entered
specifically
against
armour
saying
armour
can’t
be
in
this
kind
of
business,
and
that’s
the
very
purpose
of
this
kind
of
prophylactic
relief
in
a
decree
to
make
it
unnecessary
for
the
government
to
enter
the
particular
facts
and
prove
a
particular
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
de
novo.
the
only
question
then
as
we
see
it
is
one
of
relief
for
what
we
think
is
in
incontestively
an
interference
by
greyhound
with
the
substantive
structural
relief
that
this
whole
decree
was
designed
to
create
or
if
you
will,
an
actual
situation
where
greyhound
has
put
armour
into
violation
of
the
literal
terms
of
decree.
of
course,
it’s
plain
that
only
greyhound
and
not
armour,
its
pawn,
can
remedy
this
situation
because
the
title
to
the
stock
that
has
to
be
divested
to
give
the
government
the
relief
that
it
wants
is
in
greyhound
and
armour
of
course
in
the
remedial
sense
is
the
only
one
of
these
entities
that’s
party
to
the
decree.
as
i
indicated,
we
have
not
suggested,
we’ve
not
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
greyhound
is
in
active
participation
with
armour
in
making
armour
violate
the
decree.
what
we
have
said
is
that
as
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
which
i
think
are
quite
analogous
where
the
courts
have
found
the
power
to
issue
a
supplemental
order
creating
a
remedy
against
interference
with
school
desegregation
interference
by
a
third
party
and
not
a
party
to
the
initial
decree,
because
of
course,
the
basic
party
and
the
defendant
--
party
defendant
in
these
cases
has
been
the
school
board.
the
courts
have
had
found
no
trouble
in
creating
a
remedy
for
independent
actions
by
third
parties,
not
in
concert
with
the
school
board
and
we
think,
this
is
a
very
analogous
situation.
of
course,
section
5
of
the
sherman
act
gave
the
district
court
the
power
to
bring
greyhound
in
we
think
as
a
party
on
the
theory
that
that
was
required
to
infatuate
the
ends
of
justice
and
paragraph
18
of
the
decree,
again,
specifically
provided
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction
to
enter
appropriate
supplemental
orders
to
carry
it
out,
and
we
think
that
the
order
requested
in
the
government’s
petition
would
have
been
such
a
appropriate
order.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
to
try
to
put
this
case
back
in
focus,
perhaps
i
should
say
that
this
is
not
primarily
an
anti-trust
case
here
at
all.
it
is
an
equity
case.
we
are
not
as
we
have
said
many
times,
seeking
to
modify
this
decree.
we
do
not
rely
upon
some
general
notion
of
what’s
good
for
competition
and
what
is
bad
for
competition.
we
take
this
decree
as
we
find
that.
we
think
there
are
in
this
decree
prohibitions
against
a
certain
kind
of
structural
situation.
we
think
the
decree
did
everything
it
could
to
try
to
create
such
a
prophylactic
separation.
we
think
antitrust
decrees
should
be
able
to
do
that,
and
the
only
question
here
as
i
hope
i’ve
indicated
is
whether
there
is
a
remedy
for
such
an
interference
or
violation,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
with
a
structural
separation
which
an
antitrust
decree,
whether
it’s
a
consent
decree
or
litigating
decree
has
tried
to
establish.
we
acknowledge
of
course
that
this
is
as
far
as
we
know,
the
case
of
first
impression
in
this
court,
and
perhaps
in
any
of
the
courts,
but
that’s
of
course
why
we
brought
it
here.
we
say
frankly
that
our
case
does
depend
upon
the
proposition
that
in
a
decree,
specifically
in
an
antitrust
decree,
there
are
two
aspects;
there’s
the
substantive
aspect
and
the
remedial
aspect.
we
think
a
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
them.
this
decree
had
the
specific
substantive
aim
of
decreeing
a
separation.
that
separation
has
been
broken
down.
admittedly,
the
decree
as
written
does
not
provide
a
remedy
for
that,
and
it’s
for
that
reason
that
we
went
to
the
court
seeking
a
very
limited
additional
remedial
order
which
we
had
thought
was
necessary
to
remedy
this
breaking
down
of
the
substantive
separation
which
the
decree
was
designed
to
create.
this
case
we
think,
there’s
nothing
like
atlantic
refining
or
hughes
for
the
simple
reason
again
as
i’ve
said
that
we
think
this
decree
does
specifically
prohibit
the
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
several
things
can
be
said
about
ltv.
first
as
this
mr.
foote
is
admitted,
there’s
no
element
of
estoppel
here.
ltv
came
up
long
after
the
government
had
told
greyhound
that
it
objected
to
this
situation.
second,
and
again,
this
is
a
distinction
from
atlantic
refining,
the
government
has
never
approved
ltv’s
simultaneous
ownership
of
jones
and
laughlin
and
wilson
and
company
in
any
specific
way.
the
government
--
the
situation
is
this
and
this
is
also
true,
the
prince
case.
the
government
has
not
taken
any
action
against
those
situations
of
the
pittsburgh
case
to
which
mr.
foote
refers.
of
course,
it’s
a
section
7
case
trying
to
initially
brought
to
get
ltv
to
divest
itself
of
jones
and
laughlin.
as
far
as
i
know,
wilson
and
company
has
never
been
mentioned
in
the
proceedings
of
that
case.
and
one
further
point
on
that
if
i
may,
the
prohibition
of
the
decree
to
which
mr.
foote
refers
is
one
of
a
number
of
miscellaneous
articles
listed
in
the
end
of
the
paragraph
four
of
the
decree
which
includes
structural
steel
and
babbitt
and
a
lot
of
incidental
products
which
are
not
mentioned
for
one
thing
in
this
government’s
petition,
and
i
think
plainly,
they’re
not
central
to
the
decree
in
the
sense
in
which
we
think
the
separation
between
meat
packing
and
the
other
food
lines
is
central
to
that
decree.
so
in
light
of
that,
i
think
it’s
just
perhaps
appropriate
for
the
--
and
the
government
should
not
be
bound
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
it
has
not
taken
steps
against
that
one
particular
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
case,
united
states
against
armour
and
general
host
corporation
that
was
here
a
year
ago,
but
became
moot
before
the
court,
but
decided.
like
that
case,
it
raises
a
question
as
to
the
impact
of
the
structural
prohibitions
of
the
great
meat
packers
antitrust
decree
of
1920
to
which
armour,
one
of
the
appellees
here
nominally,
is
one
of
the
four
meat
packer
parties.
the
decree
prohibits
armour
from
having
any
involvement
in
certain
forbidden
food
lines
other
than
meat
packing,
and
the
question
in
both
of
these
cases
essentially
the
same
has
been
whether
there
is
a
remedy
under
that
decree
for
a
take
over
of
armour
by
a
company
that
is
itself
in
the
forbidden
food
line,
as
there
would
be
incontestably
a
remedy
if
armour
were
to
acquire
such
a
forbidden
food
company.
the
general
host
case
began
in
the
beginning
of
1969
when
general
host
acquired
control
of
armour.
since
general
host
was
in
the
forbidden
food
lines,
the
government
took
the
position
and
that
the
decree
was
offended
by
general
host's
takeover
of
armour,
just
as
it
would
have
been
by
the
converse
situation.
so,
we
filed
a
petition
then
against
general
host
in
the
beginning
of
1969
in
the
district
court
which
has
had
continuing
jurisdiction
over
the
meat
packers
decree
for
the
last
10
or
12
years,
by
a
transfer
from
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
decree
was
initially
entered.
at
that
time,
we
asked
the
court
to
enter
an
order
supplemental
to
the
decree
against
general
host
which
would
make
general
host
a
party
to
the
decree
and
then
prohibit
its
acquisition
of
armour.
but
judge
hoffman,
the
district
judge,
who
is
also
the
district
judge
in
the
present,
declined
to
entertain
the
petition,
saying
that
the
decree
was
aimed
only
at
affirmative
action
by
armour
or
another
named
defendant,
and
that
therefore,
the
relationship
between
armour
and
general
host
was
perfectly
consistent
with
the
decree
as
long
is
it
was
created
by
somebody
other
than
armour,
and
as
long
as
armour
avoided
actively
dealing
in
the
forbidden
food
lines.
the
government
appealed
the
case
here
and
it
was
argued
in
march
of
1970.
in
mid
may
last
year
before
this
court
could
reach
a
decision
in
the
general
host
case,
general
host
sold
its
controlling
stock
interest
in
armour
to
greyhound
corporation,
which
is
the
appellee
in
the
present
case.
over
our
objection,
this
court
then
held
that
the
case
had
become
moot
and
ordered
that
the
government’s
petition
against
general
host
be
dismissed.
the
papers
that
were
filed
in
connection
with
that
mootness
issue
are
set
forth
in
the
separate
supplemental
appendix
in
this
case
and
we’ve
recited
some
of
the
related
facts
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
repeat
them
again
here.
following
that
action
by
this
court
last
june,
the
government
promptly
filed
the
present
petition
against
greyhound,
since
in
our
view
of
greyhound
like
general
host
has
food
interests
that
the
meat
packers
decree
forbids
armour
to
have.
judge
hoffman
promptly
dismissed
this
petition
as
well
at
the
end
of
june
after
hearing
argument
by
the
government
and
off
the
record
by
counsel
for
greyhound.
as
in
the
general
host
case,
judge
hoffman
again
held
that
he
was
powerless
to
issue
any
order
against
greyhound
unless
and
until
greyhound
actually
caused
armour
to
deal
in
forbidden
food
lines.
and
so,
he
held
that
the
government’s
petition
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
again,
we
appealed,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
here
we
are
again.
the
question
in
this
case
as
in
the
general
host
case
is
whether
an
antitrust
decree
can
affectively
keep
a
party
to
that
decree
from
becoming
involved
in
another
line
of
business
where
its
involvement
would,
in
the
view
of
the
initial
decree,
create
a
recipe
competition.
judge
hoffman
held
in
each
case
that
all
the
court
can
do
in
entering
an
antitrust
decree
is
to
tell
the
party
not
to
do
anything
itself
that
would
have
the
effect
of
involving
it
in
the
forbidden
business.
and
incidentally
to
that,
can
punish
anyone
who
actively
aids
or
abets
that
party
in
doing
what
the
decree
tells
it
not
to
do.
we
say
on
the
other
hand
that
a
structural
antitrust
decree
can
be
somewhat
more
than
that,
but
a
court
can
affectively
decree
an
absolute
prophylactic
separation
between
a
particular
named
party’s
business
and
another
line
of
business.
and
we
say
this
meat
packers
decree
has
done
that,
and
that
the
court
having
for
jurisdiction
over
the
decree
can
enter
a
supplemental
order
fashioning
a
remedy
against
an
outsider
like
greyhound
which
comes
in
to
destroy
the
structural
separation
that
we
say
is
the
heart
of
the
decree.
just
as
in
the
school
desegregation
cases
that
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief,
we
think
an
anti-trust
court
has
the
power
to
issue
a
narrow
order
directed
at
a
particular
third
party
involved
in
a
particular
situation
after
a
hearing
that
will
prohibit
that
party’s
interference
with
the
effectuation
of
the
specific
purpose
at
the
heart
of
the
decree
in
question.
with
that
introduction,
let
me
turn
now
to
a
description
of
the
corporate
relationship
that
greyhound
has
created
between
armour
and
greyhound’s
forbidden
food
operations,
and
then
point
once
again
as
i
did
last
year
to
the
explicit
language
of
the
decree
that
we
think
is
designed
specifically
to
prohibit
such
relationship
from
coming
into
existence.
some
of
these
details
have
developed
since
the
hearing
--
the
argument,
as
there
really
was,
in
the
district
court
last
june,
though
there
has
not
been
any
drastic
change
that
materially
affects
our
theory
of
the
case.
these
more
recent
occurrences
are
set
forth
either
in
our
brief
or
in
greyhound’s
brief
or
in
some
instances
in
greyhound’s
annual
report
for
1970
which
has
just
recently
come
out.
we
think,
they’re
undisputed
and
it
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
have
the
current
corporate
situation.
greyhound
at
the
time
when
general
host
first
became
involved
with
armour,
greyhound
also
was
trying
to
get
control
of
armour
in
competition
with
the
general
host,
but
general
host
went
out,
winding
up
in
early
1969
with
about
57%
of
the
stock,
but
leaving
greyhound
with
something
of
the
order
of
the
third
of
the
stock.
in
the
may
1970
transactions
that
i’ve
referred
to,
greyhound
then
bought
out
general
host,
acquiring
all
of
the
stock
that
general
host
had
had,
giving
it
then
a
total
of
about
86%
of
all
of
the
stock
of
armour.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
did
mr.
justice.
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
pleadings
last
term
and
refer
to
in
one
our
brief,
greyhound
filed
an
application
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
government
was
not
a
party
there,
filed
a
pleading
in
which
we
suggested
that
the
commission
withhold
its
action
of
approving
the
issuance
of
the
greyhound
stock
involved
in
the
general
host
transaction
until
this
court
could
decide
the
antitrust
case
which
will
determine
whether
that
acquisition
was
legal
or
not.
but
the
commission
took
the
point
of
view
that
since
the
court
had
not
yet
reached
the
decision,
there
was
not
yet
anything
suggesting
that
the
transaction
was
illegal
and
then
permit
--
the
icc
is
rather
narrow
focused
which
of
course
did
not
deal
--
the
icc’s
order
does
not
deal
with
antitrust
questions
at
all,
and
of
course,
it
has
no
power
to
immunize
this
kind
of
transaction.
the
only
really
question
there
was
whether
the
issuance
of
this
additional
stock
by
greyhound
would
be
harmful
to
greyhound’s
basic
business
as
a
common
carrier.
so,
the
commission
did
approve
it
and
would
then,
a
couple
of
hours
after
notice
was
given
of
that
approval,
this
transaction
had
been
closed
and
greyhound
was
the
owner
of
armour.
greyhound
has
made
no
secret
of
the
fact.
in
fact,
it’s
stated
again
in
its
current
annual
report
that
it
went
into
armour
initially
in
1969
with
the
encouragement
of
armour’s
then
that
is
pre
general
host
management.
as
we
understand
that
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
mr.
justice,
we
are
not
making
the
argument
in
terms
of
rule
65
(d)
of
the
civil
rules
that
greyhound
is
--
has
been
in
active
participation
in
armour
with
armour
in
doing
something
in
violation
of
the
decree.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i’m
not
sure
that
we
might
not
have
charged
that.
the
case
has
not
been
handled
along
those
lines.
i
think,
it’s
--
it
has
been
perfectly
open
to
the
government
to
proceed
that
way
in
a
sense
of
course,
it’s
easier
on
greyhound
than
calling
greyhound
before
the
court
and
suggesting
that
that
it
itself
was
in
contempt.
the
government
has
regarded
this
perfectly
adequate
remedy
to
have
an
order
against
greyhound
telling
greyhound
to
divest
itself,
and
then
and
only
then
would
the
government
proceed
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
certainly
there
are
i
think
fewer
questions
to
be
argued
about
in
that
approach
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
under
that
approach
and
i
think
it
is,
as
i
say,
easier
on
greyhound.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
mr.
justice,
though
i
think
--
i
think
it
if
the
government
could
precede
directly
against
greyhound,
i
think
it
would
follow
that
it
could
proceed
indirectly
in
this
way.
i
think
assuming
the
court
agreed
with
that,
the
government
could
say
“even
though
we
could
seek
contempt
punishment
against
greyhound,
now,
we
will
give
greyhound
another
chance
and
we
would
like
the
court
to
make
clear
what
greyhound’s
obligations
are,
and
then
and
only
then
we
proceed
against
them.”
as
we
understand
that
the
armour
stock
was
initially
owned
by
greyhound’s
subsidiary.
subsequently
at
the
end
of
1970,
greyhound
arranged
a
series
of
transactions
which
resulted
first
of
all,
in
the
acquisition
of
all
of
the
rest
of
the
--
all
of
the
minority
interest
in
greyhound
--
in
armour,
giving
greyhound
a
100%
ownership,
and
then
a
reorganization
of
the
corporate
structure
so
that
armour
is
now
a
direct
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
the
greyhound
corporation
which
we’re
told
is
the
holding
company
which
owns
greyhound’s
greatest
interest,
including
its
bus
lines,
armour,
the
food
businesses
that
we
find
offensive
to
the
decree
and
various
other
lesser
interests.
and
greyhound
has
moved
with
some
rapidity
to
integrate
armour
into
its
corporate
family.
for
example,
the
current
annual
report
of
greyhound
states
“the
various
activities
had
been
coordinated,
computer
operations,
communications,
insurance
and
banking
arrangements
for
instance.”
what
greyhound
is
deemed
to
be
marginal
or
unproductive
assets
of
armour
have
been
sold,
and
several
unprofitable
armour
operations
have
been
closed.
in
fact,
our
information
is
that
something
--
armour
facilities
accounting
for
something
like
10%,
perhaps
more
of
its
annual
sales
have
been
disposed
off
by
greyhound
during
the
period
that
its
had
that
kind
of
control
over
armour.
the
report
further
says
that
a
consolidation
of
headquarter
staffs
is
planned.
a
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
greyhound
is
now
the
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
armour,
seven
of
the
11
armour
directors
or
officers
are
directors
of
greyhound,
including
the
entire
executive
committee
of
armour.
the
three
top
officers
of
armour
are
in
greyhound’s
board
of
directors
and
so
on.
so
obviously,
greyhound’s
relationship
to
armour
is
a
good
deal
more
than
that
of
a
mere
investor
or
an
ordinary
stock
holder
as
greyhound
suggests
in
its
brief.
armour
is
run
by
greyhound
people
obviously
for
the
benefit
of
greyhound
and
its
shareholders.
and
of
course,
greyhound
has
created
this
situation
with
full
knowledge
throughout,
both
of
the
meat
packers
decree
and
of
the
government’s
interpretation
of
that
decree.
side
by
side
as
i
indicated
in
the
greyhound
corporate
complex
is
another
wholly-owned
subsidiary
called
greyhound
food
management
incorporated,
which
manages
greyhound’s
forbidden
food
interests
as
we
call
them.
these
are
basically
of
two
kinds,
one
post
houses
which
operates
a
chain
of
restaurants
and
two,
the
larger
element
of
this
something
called
prophet
foods
which
is
an
industrial
catering
business
which
sells
prepared
meals
in
schools
and
industrial
plants
and
hospitals
and
various
others
establishments.
food
management
is
also
a
very
substantial
part
of
the
greyhound
complex.
taking
--
leaving
armour
out,
it
has
an
averaged
something
of
the
order
15%
of
greyhound’s
total
sales,
or
something
like
a
$110
million
to
a
$120
million
a
year.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
i
think,
it
can
be
said
to
some
extent
of
post
houses
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
which
i
believe
of
runs
restaurants
in
bus
stations.
i
think
it
also
runs
other
restaurants.
i
don’t
think
that
can
be
said
in
anyway
of
prophet
foods
which
is
the
larger
element
to
this,
which
is
basically
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
pre-prepared
meals.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
greyhound’s
counsel
could
tell
you
a
bit
more
about
that.
i
don’t
believe
airlines.
i
haven’t
seen
any
reference
to
that.
i
think
its
plants
and
then
institutions
of
various
counties.
among
other
things,
the
same
person
is
the
chairman
of
food
management
which
operates
these
other
food
businesses.
vice
chairman
of
armour
and
the
vice
president
for
food
of
greyhound
is
one
individual,
and
food
management
of
course
sells
in
prepared
form
a
great
many
of
the
commodities
in
very
large
amounts
that
are
specified
in
the
paragraphs
of
the
meat
packers
decree
telling
armour
what
it
can’t
be
involved
in.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
specific
language
of
the
decree.
paragraph
four
says
that
the
meat
packer
defendants,
including
armour,
are
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
either
directly
or
indirectly,
engaging
in
or
carrying
on
the
manufacturing,
jobbing,
selling,
transporting,
distributing
or
otherwise,
dealing
in
these
forbidden
food
products.
and
that
same
paragraph
goes
on
to
say
that
the
corporation
defendants
are
further
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
owning
either
directly
or
indirectly
any
capital
stock
or
other
interest
whatsoever
in
any
corporation
engaged
in
those
forbidden
businesses.
paragraph
six
prohibits
armour
from
directly
or
indirectly
operating
retail
meat
markets
and
paragraph
eight
of
the
decree
has
prohibitions
on
dealing
in
fresh
milk
and
cream
which
are
comparable
to
the
other
prohibitions
in
paragraph
four.
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
this
meat
packers
decree,
of
course,
is
no
mere
historical
relic.
the
packers
have
twice
asked
the
courts,
this
court
each
time
to
lower
these
prophylactic
structural
barriers
between
the
meat
packing
business
and
the
other
food
businesses,
and
each
time
the
courts,
including
this
court
has
rejected
their
arguments
the
changed
conditions,
replacement
of
the
original
officers
and
directors
who
got
armour
and
the
other
packers
into
this
in
the
first
place
and
so
forth,
have
justified
changes
in
the
decree.
so
the
decree
has
remained
intact
through
all
these
years
and
it
was
only
11
years
ago
--
10
years
ago
that
this
court
last
considered
the
modification
question.
armour
still
the
second
largest
member
of
the
meat
packing
industry?
and
that
is
still
a
quite
highly
concentrated
industry,
though
somewhat
less
so
than
it
was
in
1920.
as
justice
cardozo
said
in
1932
in
the
earlier
modification
attempt,
such
great
size
carries
with
it,
an
opportunity
for
abuse
and
not
to
be
ignored
when
the
opportunity
is
proved
to
have
been
utilized
in
the
past.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
he
said
that
the
decree
absolutely
prohibited
the
forbidden
food
lines
from
being
added
to
the
meat
packing
business.
and
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
structural
barrier
was
again
in
justice
cardozo’s
words
“to
avoid
the
difficultly
of
parading
out
particular
impeditive
evils
and
requesting
them
to
undiscovered.”
in
other
words,
i
think
a
classic
case
would
be
prophylactic
kind
of
structural
insulation
of
the
parties
to
the
decree
from
other
businesses
where
it
was
considered
that
their
involvement
would
risk
anti
competitive
effects.
i
think
then
it’s
as
clear
as
it
could
be
that
the
specific
and
primary
purpose
of
the
decree,
both
based
on
its
own
language
and
on
what
this
court
and
the
district
court
has
said
over
the
years
in
interpreting
it,
but
armour
was
to
be
kept
in
perpetuity
out
of
the
food
lines
in
which
greyhound
through
its
sister
subsidiary
of
armour
food
management
is
involved.
and
this
specific
prohibition
is
what
we
say
the
acquisition
of
armour
by
greyhound
has
interfered
with.
as
i
indicated,
they
are
now
sister
subsidiary
of
the
single
holding
company
with
interlocking
managements
and
boards
of
directors
and
common
banking
arrangements
and
so
forth.
they're
obviously,
the
common
servants
of
a
single
owner,
greyhound
or
if
you
will,
but
the
stockholders
of
greyhound.
every
bit
as
much
we
think
in
practical
terms
as
if
armour
had
acquired
food
management
or
if
greyhound
now
as
it
obviously
could
were
to
merge
the
two
of
them,
and
perhaps
operate
them
as
divisions
of
a
single
corporation.
i
think
it’s
uncontested
that
both
of
those
particular
situations
would
be
literally
prohibited
by
the
decree.
moreover,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
armour
could
not
have
created
a
holding
company
itself
which
would
own
its
stock
and
then
would
have
acquired
company
such
as
food
management.
but
of
course,
that
corporate
relationship
is
the
precise
corporate
relationship
that
now
exists
by
virtue
of
greyhound’s
acquisition
and
rearrangement
of
these
corporate
structures.
so,
the
same
--
again,
the
same
economic
unit,
the
same
corporate
family
is
in
the
two
businesses,
and
we
say
that
the
decree
was
plainly
specifically
design
to
prevent
that
exact
situation
as
to
armour
from
coming
into
being
without
regard
we
say
to
who
is
active
and
who
is
passive
in
creating
the
situation.
in
fact,
we
think
it
can
be
said
that
situation
created
by
greyhound
with
respect
to
armour
puts
amour
in
a
position
where
it
can
be
said
to
be
in
literal
violation
of
the
decree.
as
i
indicated
paragraph
four
of
the
decree,
not
only
prohibits
amour
from
directly
or
indirectly
engaging
in
the
business
in
which
food
management
is
involved,
it
also
prohibits
armour
from
owning
any
interest
whatsoever
in
any
company
that
is
engaged
in
--
in
such
a
business
as
food
management,
we
think
plainly
is
--
we
think
that
the
situation,
well,
this
interlocking
situation,
the
common
ownership
is
a
situation
where
in
realistic
appreciation
of
modern
incorporate
realities
it
has
to
be
said
that
amour
does
own
an
interest
of
a
kind,
any
interest
whatsoever
in
the
business
of
its
sister
subsidiary.
any
other
approach,
we
think
tends
to
confuse
modern
corporate
realities
with
more
traditional
notions
of
ownership
by
real
individual
people
of
real
individual
things.
but
given
the
power
that
a
holding
company
like
greyhound
has
over
the
various
corporate
structures
that
it
has
chosen
to
put
within
a
system,
we
think
that
realistically,
this
has
to
be
regarded
as
a
situation
where
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
i
can’t
speak
very
authoritatively
on
that
mr.
justice
white
because
i
--
i’m
not
aware
that
specific
analysis
has
been
done.
i
think
that
--
this
is
a
conglomerate
problem
which
of
course
the
department
has
moved
into
another
areas.
we
have
not
contended
that
that
this
would
be
a
section
7
violation.
the
very
premise
of
this
case
is
that
we
don’t
need
to
show
that
it
would
be
one.
i
think
perhaps
the
nature
of
the
dealings
between
the
two
companies
and
the
magnitude
of
the
markets
might
not
be
sufficient
to
make
it
a
very
easy
section
7
case.
in
any
event,
we
say
we
don’t
need
to
cross
that
bridge
because
there’s
already
a
decree
entered
specifically
against
armour
saying
armour
can’t
be
in
this
kind
of
business,
and
that’s
the
very
purpose
of
this
kind
of
prophylactic
relief
in
a
decree
to
make
it
unnecessary
for
the
government
to
enter
the
particular
facts
and
prove
a
particular
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
de
novo.
the
only
question
then
as
we
see
it
is
one
of
relief
for
what
we
think
is
in
incontestively
an
interference
by
greyhound
with
the
substantive
structural
relief
that
this
whole
decree
was
designed
to
create
or
if
you
will,
an
actual
situation
where
greyhound
has
put
armour
into
violation
of
the
literal
terms
of
decree.
of
course,
it’s
plain
that
only
greyhound
and
not
armour,
its
pawn,
can
remedy
this
situation
because
the
title
to
the
stock
that
has
to
be
divested
to
give
the
government
the
relief
that
it
wants
is
in
greyhound
and
armour
of
course
in
the
remedial
sense
is
the
only
one
of
these
entities
that’s
party
to
the
decree.
as
i
indicated,
we
have
not
suggested,
we’ve
not
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
greyhound
is
in
active
participation
with
armour
in
making
armour
violate
the
decree.
what
we
have
said
is
that
as
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
which
i
think
are
quite
analogous
where
the
courts
have
found
the
power
to
issue
a
supplemental
order
creating
a
remedy
against
interference
with
school
desegregation
interference
by
a
third
party
and
not
a
party
to
the
initial
decree,
because
of
course,
the
basic
party
and
the
defendant
--
party
defendant
in
these
cases
has
been
the
school
board.
the
courts
have
had
found
no
trouble
in
creating
a
remedy
for
independent
actions
by
third
parties,
not
in
concert
with
the
school
board
and
we
think,
this
is
a
very
analogous
situation.
of
course,
section
5
of
the
sherman
act
gave
the
district
court
the
power
to
bring
greyhound
in
we
think
as
a
party
on
the
theory
that
that
was
required
to
infatuate
the
ends
of
justice
and
paragraph
18
of
the
decree,
again,
specifically
provided
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction
to
enter
appropriate
supplemental
orders
to
carry
it
out,
and
we
think
that
the
order
requested
in
the
government’s
petition
would
have
been
such
a
appropriate
order.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
to
try
to
put
this
case
back
in
focus,
perhaps
i
should
say
that
this
is
not
primarily
an
anti-trust
case
here
at
all.
it
is
an
equity
case.
we
are
not
as
we
have
said
many
times,
seeking
to
modify
this
decree.
we
do
not
rely
upon
some
general
notion
of
what’s
good
for
competition
and
what
is
bad
for
competition.
we
take
this
decree
as
we
find
that.
we
think
there
are
in
this
decree
prohibitions
against
a
certain
kind
of
structural
situation.
we
think
the
decree
did
everything
it
could
to
try
to
create
such
a
prophylactic
separation.
we
think
antitrust
decrees
should
be
able
to
do
that,
and
the
only
question
here
as
i
hope
i’ve
indicated
is
whether
there
is
a
remedy
for
such
an
interference
or
violation,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
with
a
structural
separation
which
an
antitrust
decree,
whether
it’s
a
consent
decree
or
litigating
decree
has
tried
to
establish.
we
acknowledge
of
course
that
this
is
as
far
as
we
know,
the
case
of
first
impression
in
this
court,
and
perhaps
in
any
of
the
courts,
but
that’s
of
course
why
we
brought
it
here.
we
say
frankly
that
our
case
does
depend
upon
the
proposition
that
in
a
decree,
specifically
in
an
antitrust
decree,
there
are
two
aspects;
there’s
the
substantive
aspect
and
the
remedial
aspect.
we
think
a
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
them.
this
decree
had
the
specific
substantive
aim
of
decreeing
a
separation.
that
separation
has
been
broken
down.
admittedly,
the
decree
as
written
does
not
provide
a
remedy
for
that,
and
it’s
for
that
reason
that
we
went
to
the
court
seeking
a
very
limited
additional
remedial
order
which
we
had
thought
was
necessary
to
remedy
this
breaking
down
of
the
substantive
separation
which
the
decree
was
designed
to
create.
this
case
we
think,
there’s
nothing
like
atlantic
refining
or
hughes
for
the
simple
reason
again
as
i’ve
said
that
we
think
this
decree
does
specifically
prohibit
the
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
several
things
can
be
said
about
ltv.
first
as
this
mr.
foote
is
admitted,
there’s
no
element
of
estoppel
here.
ltv
came
up
long
after
the
government
had
told
greyhound
that
it
objected
to
this
situation.
second,
and
again,
this
is
a
distinction
from
atlantic
refining,
the
government
has
never
approved
ltv’s
simultaneous
ownership
of
jones
and
laughlin
and
wilson
and
company
in
any
specific
way.
the
government
--
the
situation
is
this
and
this
is
also
true,
the
prince
case.
the
government
has
not
taken
any
action
against
those
situations
of
the
pittsburgh
case
to
which
mr.
foote
refers.
of
course,
it’s
a
section
7
case
trying
to
initially
brought
to
get
ltv
to
divest
itself
of
jones
and
laughlin.
as
far
as
i
know,
wilson
and
company
has
never
been
mentioned
in
the
proceedings
of
that
case.
and
one
further
point
on
that
if
i
may,
the
prohibition
of
the
decree
to
which
mr.
foote
refers
is
one
of
a
number
of
miscellaneous
articles
listed
in
the
end
of
the
paragraph
four
of
the
decree
which
includes
structural
steel
and
babbitt
and
a
lot
of
incidental
products
which
are
not
mentioned
for
one
thing
in
this
government’s
petition,
and
i
think
plainly,
they’re
not
central
to
the
decree
in
the
sense
in
which
we
think
the
separation
between
meat
packing
and
the
other
food
lines
is
central
to
that
decree.
so
in
light
of
that,
i
think
it’s
just
perhaps
appropriate
for
the
--
and
the
government
should
not
be
bound
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
it
has
not
taken
steps
against
that
one
particular
situation.
