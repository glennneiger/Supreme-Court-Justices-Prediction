mr.
edward
l.
foote
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
greyhound
sees
the
issue,
the
question
is
one
of
application
of
traditional
and
acceptable
principles
that
apply
to
injunctions
under
rule
65
(d),
and
whether
the
accepted
law
that
applies
to
such
injunctions
is
going
to
be
observed
in
this
case
under
the
attack
of
a
justice
department
that
in
this
case,
structural
antitrust
decrees
will
be
circumvented.
the
basis
question
in
this
case
starts
with
rule
65
(d),
and
the
district
court
is
very
familiar
with
the
packers
decree
because
he
is
the
judge
who
handled
the
modification
proceedings
in
chicago
in
a
14-week
trial
back
in
1958.
this
district
court
reviewed
the
petition
and
dismissed
it.
now,
he’s
familiar
intimately
with
the
terms
of
this
decree.
judge
hoffman,
the
basis
of
judge
hoffman’s
decision
is
that
rule
65
(d)
simply
does
not
apply
to
situations
unless
someone
is
actually
participating
in
violation
of
an
injunction.
he
observed
and
i
think
the
record
is
unmistakably
clear
that
armour’s
conduct
in
this
case
is
not
at
issue.
armour
has
never
violated
the
decree.
there’s
no
suggestion
that
armour
did.
amour’s
conduct
is
impeccable.
there’s
no
suggestion
that
in
this
instance,
greyhound
is
actively
participating
with
armour
in
violating
the
decree.
and
as
the
district
court
says,
rule
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
provides
that
every
order,
granting
an
injunction
is
binding
only
upon
the
parties
to
the
action,
their
officers,
etcetera,
and
upon
those
persons
in
active
concert
or
participation.
there’s
no
part
of
this
decree
that
relates
to
the
conduct
that
the
government
is
talking
about.
i
think
it
might
be
of
interest
to
the
court.
the
court
probably
knows
that
three
years
after
this
decree
was
entered
back
in
1925,
one
of
the
original
signatories
to
the
decree,
morris
packing
company,
was
acquired
by
armour.
here,
you
have
supposed
prophylactic
and
structural
antitrust
issues
that
were
supposedly
decided
for
all
purposes
in
1920
in
this
decree,
and
yet
three
years
later,
one
of
the
original
signatories
was
acquired
by
armour.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
decree
does
preclude
some
conduct
and
it
does
not
apply
to
other
conducts.
all
of
the
stock
of
morris,
all
of
the
business
of
morris
was
acquired
by
armour.
there’s
no
attack
on
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
over
the
last
50
years
has
interpreted
this
decree
completely
inconsistent
with
their
current
interpretation.
what
you
have
as
greyhound
sees
the
matter
is
the
same
situation
that
this
court
decided
in
may
of
1969
in
the
hazeltine
zenos
litigation.
now
to
be
sure,
there
are
--
there’s
no
analogy
that’s
perfect,
but
what
did
the
court
do
in
the
hazelton
litigation?
here
are
the
similarities.
both
cases
involved
antitrust
decrees.
both
cases
involved
an
antitrust
decree
on
a
subsidiary.
both
cases
involved
the
parent
and
the
parent
obviously
owned
the
subsidiary.
now
in
the
hazelton
litigation,
this
court
said
and
reversed
the
district
court
that
you
could
not
apply
the
injunction,
the
injunction
that
was
entered
against
the
subsidiary
to
buying
the
parent,
and
the
case
was
reversed
on
that
ground.
this
court
at
that
time
again
referred
to
rule
65
(d).
neither
the
judgment
of
damages
nor
the
injunction
against
hazeltine
was
proper.
although
injunctions
issued
by
federal
courts
by
and
not
only
the
parties
defendant
in
a
suit,
they
cannot
--
the
court
goes
on
to
quote
rule
65
(d)
apply
to
the
parent
in
that
case
hazeltine,
since
hazeltine
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this?
why
does
the
government
not
apply
the
traditional
law
that
applies
to
normal
injunctions
under
rule
65
(d)
to
this
case?
isn’t
really
the
issue
in
this
case
whether
the
injunction
entered
in
1920
against
armour
buy-ins
armour’s
stockholders,
in
this
instance;
greyhound.
that’s
really
what
the
government
is
asking
for.
they
want
the
injunction
to
run
up
stream,
and
isn’t
that
contrary
to
the
theory
of
the
hazeltine
litigation
where
in
that
instance,
the
court
refused
to
support
the
district
court
that
had
done
just
that.
over
the
years,
the
packer’s
decree
has
been
interpreted.
the
court
of
course
well
knows
justice
cardozo’s
decision
back
in
1932
and
it
was
again
reviewed
in
the
50’s
by
the
district
judge
hoffman.
those
proceedings
involved
modifications
of
a
decree.
in
those
situations,
parties
went
into
court
and
asked
that
a
decree
be
modified.
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
united
shoe
case,
and
in
that
case,
justice
fortas
for
the
supreme
court
set
down
the
rules
that
govern
modifications
of
decrees,
but
i
think
it’s
very
important
to
observe
that
in
this
case,
the
department
of
justice,
that
the
government
is
not
seeking
a
modification
of
the
decree.
they
are
not
going
into
court
under
the
united
shoe
theory
and
asking
for
modification.
what
other
kind
of
cases
then
has
this
court
considered
interpreting
decrees
and
trying
to
extend
them?
well,
i
suggest
for
the
court
justice
black’s
decision
in
the
atlantic
refining
case
in
1959.
that
case
is
very
similar
to
this
case
in
several
respects.
both
cases
started
out
with
the
complaint
alleging
illegal
conduct.
in
the
atlantic
refining
case,
a
trial
actually
started
and
later
on,
a
consent
decree
was
entered.
the
consent
decree
prohibited
various
shippers
and
owners
from
certain
discriminatory
arrangements
with
one
exception
that
a
7%
payment
was
permitted
under
the
consent
decree.
the
government
having
consented
to
that
decree
operated
under
it
with
the
parties
for
approximately
16
years.
and
then
in
1957,
the
government
did
in
that
case,
what
they
have
done
here.
they
did
not
seek
modification.
they
went
into
court
and
simply
said
the
language
of
the
consent
decree
applies
to
this
situation,
meaning
a
situation
that
was
actually
the
subject
of
the
original
decree,
and
they
wanted
interpretation
of
the
language.
they
didn’t
want
a
remand.
they
didn’t
want
any
modification
hearing.
they
wanted
the
language
of
the
decree
itself
stretched
to
include
the
conduct
that
they
quarrel
about
in
the
second
proceeding
in
1957.
now
in
that
case
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
well
in
an
original
action
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
in
terms
of
what
would
happen
in
that
case,
judge
hoffman
discussed
that
and
he
indicated
that
he
would
certainly
enter
an
order
against
armour,
if
armour’s
conduct
ever
appeared
to
violate
the
decree.
i
believe
that
he
would
also
ask
that
the
party
who
is
being
acquired
be
brought
in,
but
it's
--
if
that
answers
your
question,
i
believe
he
could
do
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
oh!
i
don’t
know
whether
the
order
would
run
against
the
seller
mr.
justice,
but
the
court
would
issue
an
order
against
armour
and
if
the
court
issued
a
summons
against
the
third
party,
presumably
if
the
third
party
were
--
under
rule
65
(d),
if
the
third
party
were
actively
participating
in
it,
it
comes
within
rule
65
(d).
mr.
edward
l.
foote
mr.
justice,
we
have
never
contended
that
the
decree
is
simply
limited
to
the
packers.
we
would
like
to
apply
to
this
case
the
traditional
law
that
is
applied
in
any
injunctive
case;
meaning
rule
65
(d).
what
has
happened
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
because
of
the
purpose
that
the
government
sees
in
this
decree,
they
want
to
circumvent
the
normal
rules
that
apply
to
injunctions.
they
have
cited
no
cases
that
are
parallel
to
this.
the
forbus
(ph)
case
is
not
an
analogies
situation
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that
is
correct.
this
petition
does
not
allege
any
such
facts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
the
district
court
in
the
briefs
of
this
case,
the
united
states
has
abandoned
that
position.
they
do
not
want
to
urge
that
position.
they
have
never
alleged
any
active
concert
or
participation.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
i
believe
mr.
justice,
that’s
what
rule
65
(d)
says.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
this
case
is
in
part
about
that.
there
are
other
issues.
under
the
atlantic
refining
case
as
justice
black
observed,
the
purpose
of
the
decree
even
if
the
purpose
of
the
decree
would
be
better
served
by
the
proceeding
that
the
government
brought,
you
cannot
modify
without
a
modification
hearing
the
language
of
the
decree
particularly
since
the
government
in
that
case
and
in
this
has
consistently
over
the
years
had
a
completely
different
interpretation.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
problem
of
the
interpretation
of
the
government
in
this
decree
over
the
last
50
years
is
not
estopping
the
government
in
this
instance.
but
as
in
the
atlantic
refining
case
as
justice
black
said
in
that
case,
for
17
years,
the
government
had
interpreted
the
decree
consistent
with
his
interpretation
in
the
opinion
in
that
case,
and
the
new
interpretation,
which
was
a
new
interpretation
by
the
government,
he
suggested
that
perhaps
modification
proceedings
were
in
order.
based
upon
that
consistent
interpretation
over
the
17
years,
you
can
read
into
the
decree
its
actual
purpose.
now
in
this
instance
as
the
court
knows,
the
government
has
interpreted
this
decree
completely
different
from
the
suggestion
made
to
this
court.
in
the
ltv
litigation
on
march
10,
1970,
while
this
case
--
that
is
the
general
host
case,
it
was
in
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
was
filing
papers
in
pittsburgh
on
this
very
decree
in
the
sense
that
wilson
and
co.,
which
is
original
signatory
to
the
packers
decree
was
a
party
as
a
subsidiary
of
ltv
in
the
pittsburgh
litigation.
now
in
that
case,
the
government
suggested
to
the
court
that
ltv
could
own
86
or
some
percent
of
wilson
and
co.,
and
also
own
jones
and
laughlin.
jones
and
laughlin
has
products
which
are
expressly
included
in
the
decree.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
those
two
situations?
in
both
situations,
you
have
a
form
of
conglomerate,
a
holding
company
ltv
or
the
greyhound
corporation.
in
both
situations,
each
of
the
holding
companies
had
a
major
transportation
company,
the
greyhound
bus
company,
contrast
to
the
braniff
airlines,
one
of
ltv’s
subsidiaries.
in
both
situations,
the
holding
company,
greyhound
or
ltv
had
a
substantial
interest
in
a
packer,
wilson
&
company,
or
in
this
instance
armour
and
in
both
situations,
they
were
alleged
to
be
decree
products
in
another
subsidiary.
now
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
mr.
justice,
it’s
our
view
that
no
such
order
could
be
binding.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
it
is
our
view
that
injunction
such
as
that
cannot
run
against
the
world.
you
could
perhaps
enjoin
the
transfer
of
stock.
you
could
enter
an
order
that
the
transfer
agent
could
not
transfer
the
stock.
you
could
put
people
on
notice,
but
under
rule
65
(d),
even
after
actual
notice
on
a
party,
you
must
have
active
participation.
it
seems
to
us
the
question
here
is
what
traditional
law
is
as
it
applies
to
injunctions
on
non
parties?
if
that
is
not
the
proper
law,
and
if
we’re
going
to
accept
the
government’s
view
that
injunctions
once
entered
buy-in
parents,
even
corporations
that
acquire
the
stock
at
the
later
time,
how
can
we
justify
the
court’s
decision
in
the
hazeltine
litigation,
whereas
65
(d)
was
used
very
specifically
to
reverse
the
district
court
for
entering
an
injunction
against
hazeltine
corporation.
this
is
the
traditional
law
as
we
see
it.
we
think
it’s
the
traditional
laws
this
court
has
seen
it
over
the
years.
now
here
for
some
reason,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
this
traditional
law
applying
to
an
injunctions
should
be
extended,
and
it
should
be
extended
according
to
the
government
because
if
that
is
not
done,
structural
antitrust
decrees
will
be
circumvented.
but
if
there
is
any
need
to
look
to
an
illustration
of
how
to
circumvent
structural
antitrust
decrees;
we
can
look
at
the
government’s
own
conduct
in
the
ltv
litigation.
there
isn’t
a
particle
of
difference
between
what
the
government
did
in
ltv
and
this
case,
and
yet
in
ltv,
the
government
suggested
to
a
federal
court
in
pittsburgh
that
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
ltv
to
own
a
company,
jones
and
laughlin,
the
deals
in
prohibited
products
and
also
own
86%
of
wilson
and
co.
now,
the
apology
for
that
let’s
call
it
“different
point
of
view”
was
stated
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
court
last
year
in
the
host
litigation
as
follows.
a
proposal
of
settlement,
this
is
the
ltv
litigation,
does
not
make
law,
especially
in
light
of
the
serious
anti-competitive
factors
involved
in
the
underlying
case;
meaning
this
case.
moreover,
the
prohibition
under
the
meat
packers
decree
to
which
greyhound
points
comes
under
the
heading
of
miscellaneous
articles.
but
if
we
are
really
in
this
case
not
trying
an
anti-trust
lawsuit,
and
we
think
this
is
exactly
what
the
government
is
doing,
are
circumventing
the
requirements
of
section
7
and
trying
to
extend
this
decree
well
beyond
this
court’s
decisions
both
in
the
hughes
case
and
at
atlantic
refining.
in
both
those
cases,
this
court
pointedly
said,
it
might
well
serve
the
purpose
of
the
government
and
might
well
serve
the
prophylactic
effect
of
the
decree
to
have
the
release
entered.
but,
we
can’t
look
to
those
purposes
because
the
government
over
the
years
has
interpreted
the
decree
inconsistent
with
that.
in
the
hughes
litigation
and
in
both
the
atlantic
refining
litigation,
the
government
tried
to
do
exactly
what
their
trying
to
do
here
and
this
court
did
not
accept
those
arguments.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
law
is
a
little
different
in
modification
proceedings.
there
as
justice
cardozo
indicated
the
1932
if
someone
goes
into
court
and
actually
seeks
a
modification
of
a
decree,
then,
you
have
to
analyze
the
background
of
the
decree.
you
have
to
analyze
its
purposes
in
order
to
determine
the
extent
and
breadth
of
the
modification,
but
this
is
not
a
modification
proceeding.
this
is
a
proceeding
brought
under
the
decree
to
extent
its
terms
well
beyond
any
language
in
the
decree.
the
decree
merely
forbids
armour
from
doing
various
things.
it
prohibits
armour
from
owning
any
companies
that
actually
are
in
decree
products.
there
isn’t
a
slightest
suggestion
in
this
case
that
armour
is
violating
that
decree.
we
have
an
attempt
to
apply
the
decree
to
a
parent
or
stockholder
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
as
justice
black
said
in
the
atlantic
refining
case
which
is
a
case
like
this,
not
a
modification
proceeding,
you
must
look
to
the
experience
and
the
conduct
to
the
parties
over
the
years
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
application
of
the
decree
to
this
new
situation
and
what
has
been
the
experience
over
the
years.
in
1925,
armour
was
permitted
to
acquire
a
packer,
morris.
ltv
in
recent
times
is
permitted
to
have
exactly
this
same
relationship
with
--
that
they
are
now
complaining
about
with
wilson
and
co.,
another
packer.
how
can
we
possibly
distinguish
those
two
situations?
how
can
the
government
on
march
10,
1970
file
papers
in
the
federal
court
asking
that
that
relationship
be
approved
and
at
the
same
time,
file
papers
in
this
court
asking
as
to
another
packer
that
that
relationship
be
stopped.
over
the
years,
there
has
been
a
consistent
interpretation
by
the
government
that
this
does
--
this
decree
does
not
apply
to
upstairs
activity
by
the
packers.
meaning
for
example,
let’s
take
fh
prince
and
co.
inc.
fh
prince
and
co.
inc.
owned
100%
of
the
stock
of
the
usynt,
the
union
stock
yard
and
transit
company
in
chicago;
one
of
the
direct
prophylactic
provisions
of
this
decree
was
that
armour
would
have
no
relationship
with
a
stock
yard.
there’s
a
specific
provision
asking
for
divestiture
and
divestiture
occurred,
but
in
between
1958
and
1960,
fh
prince
and
co.
inc
had
controlling
interest
through
a
variety
of
prince
interests
of
armour,
and
also
own
100%
of
the
stock
of
the
usynt.
the
usynt
operates
restaurants.
all
these
facts
were
known
to
the
government
and
acquiesced
in
because
they
were
trying
the
modification
proceeding
in
chicago
during
the
same
period.
so,
you
have
a
decree
which
has
never
been
applied
in
50
years
to
investments
in
a
packer.
it
wasn’t
applied
when
morris
was
acquired,
a
signatory.
it
wasn’t
applied
when
fh
prince
and
co.
inc
owned
both
usynt
and
armour.
it
wasn’t
applied
in
the
ltv
litigation
in
which
ltv
owns
both
a
packer
and
a
corporation
that
deals
in
decree
products.
with
50
years
of
experience,
interpreting
the
decree
in
that
way,
under
the
atlantic
refining
case,
this
court’s
latest
decision
that
we
know
on
this
subject,
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
as
justice
black
suggested
in
that
case,
perhaps
modification
is
appropriate,
but
this
is
not
a
modification
proceeding.
this
is
a
proceeding
in
which
the
government
contends
that
the
purposes
they
see
in
this
decree,
purposes
that
go
back
to
1920,
control
the
anti-trust
issues
of
today.
we
have,
not
in
our
briefs,
attempted
to
answer
it,
but
many
references
outside
of
the
record
concerning
meat
and
other
food
facts
that
supposedly
control
the
anti
competitive
facts
in
the
meat
industry
today.
we
don’t
think
it
is
appropriate
to
put
in
briefs
in
this
court
a
lot
of
references
to
how
much
control
armour
does
or
doesn’t
have.
we
would
like
to
dispute
them.
we
don’t
think
that
the
meat
industry
has
anywhere
near
the
control
that
used
to
have,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that’s
an
irrelevant
point.
what
we
really
have
in
this
case
is
a
simple
issue
of
interpreting
the
decree
under
rule
65
(d).
why
does
the
government
not
proceed
under
rule
65
(d)?
they
admittedly
have
not.
they
admittedly
want
to
challenge
this
court’s
decision
like
in
atlantic
refining,
and
they
admittedly
want
to
take
a
different
position
in
this
case
than
they
have
in
other
cases.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
decree?
the
government
seems
to
be
able
to
read
out
of
the
decree
a
variety
of
purposes
which
we
can’t
find.
the
decree
itself
which
was
entered
in
1920
contains
an
express
provision
in
the
beginning
of
it
that
the
packers,
first
of
all,
deny
all
the
charges.
this
is
a
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
and
the
settlement
of
the
lawsuit
contains
in
it
an
express
provision
that
says
that
the
entry
of
a
settlement
decree
is
no
admission
on
their
part
that
they’ve
ever
violated
the
laws
or
have
monopolies.
this
decree
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
of
the
monopoly
ever
existed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
prophylactic
nature
of
this
decree
is
such
that
accretions
of
power
among
the
packers
are
included
in
its
prohibitions,
then
how
could
the
government,
three
years
after
the
ink
was
dry
on
this
decree,
permit
armour
to
acquire
morris?
and
if
that
is
so,
how
can
the
government
contend
against
greyhound
that
we
cannot
through
different
subsidiaries
own
a
packer
and
a
company
that
has
some
decree
products
when
they
permit
other
companies
too?
what
is
the
difference
between
the
board
of
directors
of
ltv
and
the
board
of
directors
of
greyhound?
we’re
not
saying
the
government
is
estopped.
if
they
want
to
let
ltv
conduct
their
affairs
that
way,
obviously,
that’s
their
right,
but
in
interpreting
the
decree
over
the
years
in
that
way,
under
this
court’s
decided
authority,
those
facts
are
material
in
determining
the
purposes
of
the
decree.
i
have
one
last
point.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
armour,
its
prophet
foods.
greyhound
has
another
subsidiary.
it
operates
in
the
food
business.
it’s
in
the
catering
business.
it
also
has
another
small
subsidiary
that
sells
food
as
an
accommodation
to
people
who
want
to
buy
food
when
they
stop
at
the
bus
line
out
in
omaha
or
some
place.
this
is
a
small
business.
it’s
part
of
an
adjunct
to
their
bus
business.
now,
if
the
court
is
going
to
except
the
government’s
arguments,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
as
we
stated
in
the
relief
paragraph
of
the
appeal
brief
is
that
we
divest
ourselves,
that
is
we
get
rid
of
say
prophet
foods.
this
is
not
an
antitrust
case,
there’s
no
finding
here
that
greyhound
has
violated
any
law.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
no,
your
honor.
we
have
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
we
have
no
record.
i
believe
we
have
furnished
such
information
to
the
department
of
justice
in
their
investigation
of
this
case,
starting
out
as
a
section
7
investigation,
but
it’s
never
been
made
a
party
--
part
of
this
record,
but
more
than
that
mr.
chief
justice,
the
problem
here
is
not
one
of
an
anti-trust
violation.
there
are
references
in
this
appeal
to
reciprocity,
the
possible
control
of
prices
by
a
combination
between
armour
and
greyhound.
all
of
these
statements
are
not
in
the
record.
at
this
juncture
all
we
have
is
a
petition
filed
which
merely
states
that
they
want
a
subpoena
or
summons
issued
against
greyhound
under
section
5
of
the
sherman
act,
and
that
requires
a
finding
that
the
action
be
pending,
and
when
a
district
judge
who’s
had
a
lot
of
experience
in
this
matters,
repeatedly
asked
counsel
for
the
government,
to
give
me
some
authority
on
this;
they
cited
the
byre
(ph)
case.
the
byre
case
the
only
one
we
know
off,
but
in
that
case,
this
third
party
was
permitted
to
litigate
the
merits
of
the
original
decree.
that
can’t
perceivably
be
what
the
government
is
asking
for
in
this
case
and
yet,
it’s
the
only
case
that
could
be
cited
and
the
reason
is,
it’s
at
section
5
of
the
sherman
act
requires
a
finding
that
the
action
is
pending
before
summon
is
issued.
we
think
this
whole
business
of
possible
circumvention
of
antitrust
decree
is
a
rouse.
the
government
is
trying
to
create
a
noble
public
interest
objective
to
get
around
the
basic
rules
of
injunctions
that
apply
in
case
after
case
and
a
careful
reading
of
this
record
in
the
hearings
before
judge
hoffman.
judge
hoffman
is
a
seasoned
experienced
judge;
one
of
many
and
all
the
district
judges
have
problems
of
injunctions.
and
it’s
just
judge
hoffman
said
“what
am
i
to
do
in
the
next
injunction
case?
i
have
all
kinds
of
injunctions
over
my
experience
on
the
bench.
i
have
many
injunctions.
are
we
going
to
apply
these
rules
to
that
kind
of
a
case?”
the
government
in
this
case
is
actually
seeking
to
have
the
rules
that
normally
apply
in
injunctions
and
the
rules
that
they
have
permitted
to
apply
to
the
packers
decree
to
be
amended
in
this
proceeding.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
greyhound
sees
the
issue,
the
question
is
one
of
application
of
traditional
and
acceptable
principles
that
apply
to
injunctions
under
rule
65
(d),
and
whether
the
accepted
law
that
applies
to
such
injunctions
is
going
to
be
observed
in
this
case
under
the
attack
of
a
justice
department
that
in
this
case,
structural
antitrust
decrees
will
be
circumvented.
the
basis
question
in
this
case
starts
with
rule
65
(d),
and
the
district
court
is
very
familiar
with
the
packers
decree
because
he
is
the
judge
who
handled
the
modification
proceedings
in
chicago
in
a
14-week
trial
back
in
1958.
this
district
court
reviewed
the
petition
and
dismissed
it.
now,
he’s
familiar
intimately
with
the
terms
of
this
decree.
judge
hoffman,
the
basis
of
judge
hoffman’s
decision
is
that
rule
65
(d)
simply
does
not
apply
to
situations
unless
someone
is
actually
participating
in
violation
of
an
injunction.
he
observed
and
i
think
the
record
is
unmistakably
clear
that
armour’s
conduct
in
this
case
is
not
at
issue.
armour
has
never
violated
the
decree.
there’s
no
suggestion
that
armour
did.
amour’s
conduct
is
impeccable.
there’s
no
suggestion
that
in
this
instance,
greyhound
is
actively
participating
with
armour
in
violating
the
decree.
and
as
the
district
court
says,
rule
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
provides
that
every
order,
granting
an
injunction
is
binding
only
upon
the
parties
to
the
action,
their
officers,
etcetera,
and
upon
those
persons
in
active
concert
or
participation.
there’s
no
part
of
this
decree
that
relates
to
the
conduct
that
the
government
is
talking
about.
i
think
it
might
be
of
interest
to
the
court.
the
court
probably
knows
that
three
years
after
this
decree
was
entered
back
in
1925,
one
of
the
original
signatories
to
the
decree,
morris
packing
company,
was
acquired
by
armour.
here,
you
have
supposed
prophylactic
and
structural
antitrust
issues
that
were
supposedly
decided
for
all
purposes
in
1920
in
this
decree,
and
yet
three
years
later,
one
of
the
original
signatories
was
acquired
by
armour.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
decree
does
preclude
some
conduct
and
it
does
not
apply
to
other
conducts.
all
of
the
stock
of
morris,
all
of
the
business
of
morris
was
acquired
by
armour.
there’s
no
attack
on
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
over
the
last
50
years
has
interpreted
this
decree
completely
inconsistent
with
their
current
interpretation.
what
you
have
as
greyhound
sees
the
matter
is
the
same
situation
that
this
court
decided
in
may
of
1969
in
the
hazeltine
zenos
litigation.
now
to
be
sure,
there
are
--
there’s
no
analogy
that’s
perfect,
but
what
did
the
court
do
in
the
hazelton
litigation?
here
are
the
similarities.
both
cases
involved
antitrust
decrees.
both
cases
involved
an
antitrust
decree
on
a
subsidiary.
both
cases
involved
the
parent
and
the
parent
obviously
owned
the
subsidiary.
now
in
the
hazelton
litigation,
this
court
said
and
reversed
the
district
court
that
you
could
not
apply
the
injunction,
the
injunction
that
was
entered
against
the
subsidiary
to
buying
the
parent,
and
the
case
was
reversed
on
that
ground.
this
court
at
that
time
again
referred
to
rule
65
(d).
neither
the
judgment
of
damages
nor
the
injunction
against
hazeltine
was
proper.
although
injunctions
issued
by
federal
courts
by
and
not
only
the
parties
defendant
in
a
suit,
they
cannot
--
the
court
goes
on
to
quote
rule
65
(d)
apply
to
the
parent
in
that
case
hazeltine,
since
hazeltine
was
not
a
party
to
the
litigation.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this?
why
does
the
government
not
apply
the
traditional
law
that
applies
to
normal
injunctions
under
rule
65
(d)
to
this
case?
isn’t
really
the
issue
in
this
case
whether
the
injunction
entered
in
1920
against
armour
buy-ins
armour’s
stockholders,
in
this
instance;
greyhound.
that’s
really
what
the
government
is
asking
for.
they
want
the
injunction
to
run
up
stream,
and
isn’t
that
contrary
to
the
theory
of
the
hazeltine
litigation
where
in
that
instance,
the
court
refused
to
support
the
district
court
that
had
done
just
that.
over
the
years,
the
packer’s
decree
has
been
interpreted.
the
court
of
course
well
knows
justice
cardozo’s
decision
back
in
1932
and
it
was
again
reviewed
in
the
50’s
by
the
district
judge
hoffman.
those
proceedings
involved
modifications
of
a
decree.
in
those
situations,
parties
went
into
court
and
asked
that
a
decree
be
modified.
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
united
shoe
case,
and
in
that
case,
justice
fortas
for
the
supreme
court
set
down
the
rules
that
govern
modifications
of
decrees,
but
i
think
it’s
very
important
to
observe
that
in
this
case,
the
department
of
justice,
that
the
government
is
not
seeking
a
modification
of
the
decree.
they
are
not
going
into
court
under
the
united
shoe
theory
and
asking
for
modification.
what
other
kind
of
cases
then
has
this
court
considered
interpreting
decrees
and
trying
to
extend
them?
well,
i
suggest
for
the
court
justice
black’s
decision
in
the
atlantic
refining
case
in
1959.
that
case
is
very
similar
to
this
case
in
several
respects.
both
cases
started
out
with
the
complaint
alleging
illegal
conduct.
in
the
atlantic
refining
case,
a
trial
actually
started
and
later
on,
a
consent
decree
was
entered.
the
consent
decree
prohibited
various
shippers
and
owners
from
certain
discriminatory
arrangements
with
one
exception
that
a
7%
payment
was
permitted
under
the
consent
decree.
the
government
having
consented
to
that
decree
operated
under
it
with
the
parties
for
approximately
16
years.
and
then
in
1957,
the
government
did
in
that
case,
what
they
have
done
here.
they
did
not
seek
modification.
they
went
into
court
and
simply
said
the
language
of
the
consent
decree
applies
to
this
situation,
meaning
a
situation
that
was
actually
the
subject
of
the
original
decree,
and
they
wanted
interpretation
of
the
language.
they
didn’t
want
a
remand.
they
didn’t
want
any
modification
hearing.
they
wanted
the
language
of
the
decree
itself
stretched
to
include
the
conduct
that
they
quarrel
about
in
the
second
proceeding
in
1957.
now
in
that
case
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
well
in
an
original
action
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
in
terms
of
what
would
happen
in
that
case,
judge
hoffman
discussed
that
and
he
indicated
that
he
would
certainly
enter
an
order
against
armour,
if
armour’s
conduct
ever
appeared
to
violate
the
decree.
i
believe
that
he
would
also
ask
that
the
party
who
is
being
acquired
be
brought
in,
but
it's
--
if
that
answers
your
question,
i
believe
he
could
do
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
oh!
i
don’t
know
whether
the
order
would
run
against
the
seller
mr.
justice,
but
the
court
would
issue
an
order
against
armour
and
if
the
court
issued
a
summons
against
the
third
party,
presumably
if
the
third
party
were
--
under
rule
65
(d),
if
the
third
party
were
actively
participating
in
it,
it
comes
within
rule
65
(d).
mr.
edward
l.
foote
mr.
justice,
we
have
never
contended
that
the
decree
is
simply
limited
to
the
packers.
we
would
like
to
apply
to
this
case
the
traditional
law
that
is
applied
in
any
injunctive
case;
meaning
rule
65
(d).
what
has
happened
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
because
of
the
purpose
that
the
government
sees
in
this
decree,
they
want
to
circumvent
the
normal
rules
that
apply
to
injunctions.
they
have
cited
no
cases
that
are
parallel
to
this.
the
forbus
(ph)
case
is
not
an
analogies
situation
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that
is
correct.
this
petition
does
not
allege
any
such
facts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
the
district
court
in
the
briefs
of
this
case,
the
united
states
has
abandoned
that
position.
they
do
not
want
to
urge
that
position.
they
have
never
alleged
any
active
concert
or
participation.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
i
believe
mr.
justice,
that’s
what
rule
65
(d)
says.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
this
case
is
in
part
about
that.
there
are
other
issues.
under
the
atlantic
refining
case
as
justice
black
observed,
the
purpose
of
the
decree
even
if
the
purpose
of
the
decree
would
be
better
served
by
the
proceeding
that
the
government
brought,
you
cannot
modify
without
a
modification
hearing
the
language
of
the
decree
particularly
since
the
government
in
that
case
and
in
this
has
consistently
over
the
years
had
a
completely
different
interpretation.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
problem
of
the
interpretation
of
the
government
in
this
decree
over
the
last
50
years
is
not
estopping
the
government
in
this
instance.
but
as
in
the
atlantic
refining
case
as
justice
black
said
in
that
case,
for
17
years,
the
government
had
interpreted
the
decree
consistent
with
his
interpretation
in
the
opinion
in
that
case,
and
the
new
interpretation,
which
was
a
new
interpretation
by
the
government,
he
suggested
that
perhaps
modification
proceedings
were
in
order.
based
upon
that
consistent
interpretation
over
the
17
years,
you
can
read
into
the
decree
its
actual
purpose.
now
in
this
instance
as
the
court
knows,
the
government
has
interpreted
this
decree
completely
different
from
the
suggestion
made
to
this
court.
in
the
ltv
litigation
on
march
10,
1970,
while
this
case
--
that
is
the
general
host
case,
it
was
in
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
was
filing
papers
in
pittsburgh
on
this
very
decree
in
the
sense
that
wilson
and
co.,
which
is
original
signatory
to
the
packers
decree
was
a
party
as
a
subsidiary
of
ltv
in
the
pittsburgh
litigation.
now
in
that
case,
the
government
suggested
to
the
court
that
ltv
could
own
86
or
some
percent
of
wilson
and
co.,
and
also
own
jones
and
laughlin.
jones
and
laughlin
has
products
which
are
expressly
included
in
the
decree.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
those
two
situations?
in
both
situations,
you
have
a
form
of
conglomerate,
a
holding
company
ltv
or
the
greyhound
corporation.
in
both
situations,
each
of
the
holding
companies
had
a
major
transportation
company,
the
greyhound
bus
company,
contrast
to
the
braniff
airlines,
one
of
ltv’s
subsidiaries.
in
both
situations,
the
holding
company,
greyhound
or
ltv
had
a
substantial
interest
in
a
packer,
wilson
&
company,
or
in
this
instance
armour
and
in
both
situations,
they
were
alleged
to
be
decree
products
in
another
subsidiary.
now
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
mr.
justice,
it’s
our
view
that
no
such
order
could
be
binding.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
it
is
our
view
that
injunction
such
as
that
cannot
run
against
the
world.
you
could
perhaps
enjoin
the
transfer
of
stock.
you
could
enter
an
order
that
the
transfer
agent
could
not
transfer
the
stock.
you
could
put
people
on
notice,
but
under
rule
65
(d),
even
after
actual
notice
on
a
party,
you
must
have
active
participation.
it
seems
to
us
the
question
here
is
what
traditional
law
is
as
it
applies
to
injunctions
on
non
parties?
if
that
is
not
the
proper
law,
and
if
we’re
going
to
accept
the
government’s
view
that
injunctions
once
entered
buy-in
parents,
even
corporations
that
acquire
the
stock
at
the
later
time,
how
can
we
justify
the
court’s
decision
in
the
hazeltine
litigation,
whereas
65
(d)
was
used
very
specifically
to
reverse
the
district
court
for
entering
an
injunction
against
hazeltine
corporation.
this
is
the
traditional
law
as
we
see
it.
we
think
it’s
the
traditional
laws
this
court
has
seen
it
over
the
years.
now
here
for
some
reason,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
this
traditional
law
applying
to
an
injunctions
should
be
extended,
and
it
should
be
extended
according
to
the
government
because
if
that
is
not
done,
structural
antitrust
decrees
will
be
circumvented.
but
if
there
is
any
need
to
look
to
an
illustration
of
how
to
circumvent
structural
antitrust
decrees;
we
can
look
at
the
government’s
own
conduct
in
the
ltv
litigation.
there
isn’t
a
particle
of
difference
between
what
the
government
did
in
ltv
and
this
case,
and
yet
in
ltv,
the
government
suggested
to
a
federal
court
in
pittsburgh
that
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
ltv
to
own
a
company,
jones
and
laughlin,
the
deals
in
prohibited
products
and
also
own
86%
of
wilson
and
co.
now,
the
apology
for
that
let’s
call
it
“different
point
of
view”
was
stated
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
court
last
year
in
the
host
litigation
as
follows.
a
proposal
of
settlement,
this
is
the
ltv
litigation,
does
not
make
law,
especially
in
light
of
the
serious
anti-competitive
factors
involved
in
the
underlying
case;
meaning
this
case.
moreover,
the
prohibition
under
the
meat
packers
decree
to
which
greyhound
points
comes
under
the
heading
of
miscellaneous
articles.
but
if
we
are
really
in
this
case
not
trying
an
anti-trust
lawsuit,
and
we
think
this
is
exactly
what
the
government
is
doing,
are
circumventing
the
requirements
of
section
7
and
trying
to
extend
this
decree
well
beyond
this
court’s
decisions
both
in
the
hughes
case
and
at
atlantic
refining.
in
both
those
cases,
this
court
pointedly
said,
it
might
well
serve
the
purpose
of
the
government
and
might
well
serve
the
prophylactic
effect
of
the
decree
to
have
the
release
entered.
but,
we
can’t
look
to
those
purposes
because
the
government
over
the
years
has
interpreted
the
decree
inconsistent
with
that.
in
the
hughes
litigation
and
in
both
the
atlantic
refining
litigation,
the
government
tried
to
do
exactly
what
their
trying
to
do
here
and
this
court
did
not
accept
those
arguments.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
law
is
a
little
different
in
modification
proceedings.
there
as
justice
cardozo
indicated
the
1932
if
someone
goes
into
court
and
actually
seeks
a
modification
of
a
decree,
then,
you
have
to
analyze
the
background
of
the
decree.
you
have
to
analyze
its
purposes
in
order
to
determine
the
extent
and
breadth
of
the
modification,
but
this
is
not
a
modification
proceeding.
this
is
a
proceeding
brought
under
the
decree
to
extent
its
terms
well
beyond
any
language
in
the
decree.
the
decree
merely
forbids
armour
from
doing
various
things.
it
prohibits
armour
from
owning
any
companies
that
actually
are
in
decree
products.
there
isn’t
a
slightest
suggestion
in
this
case
that
armour
is
violating
that
decree.
we
have
an
attempt
to
apply
the
decree
to
a
parent
or
stockholder
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
as
justice
black
said
in
the
atlantic
refining
case
which
is
a
case
like
this,
not
a
modification
proceeding,
you
must
look
to
the
experience
and
the
conduct
to
the
parties
over
the
years
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
application
of
the
decree
to
this
new
situation
and
what
has
been
the
experience
over
the
years.
in
1925,
armour
was
permitted
to
acquire
a
packer,
morris.
ltv
in
recent
times
is
permitted
to
have
exactly
this
same
relationship
with
--
that
they
are
now
complaining
about
with
wilson
and
co.,
another
packer.
how
can
we
possibly
distinguish
those
two
situations?
how
can
the
government
on
march
10,
1970
file
papers
in
the
federal
court
asking
that
that
relationship
be
approved
and
at
the
same
time,
file
papers
in
this
court
asking
as
to
another
packer
that
that
relationship
be
stopped.
over
the
years,
there
has
been
a
consistent
interpretation
by
the
government
that
this
does
--
this
decree
does
not
apply
to
upstairs
activity
by
the
packers.
meaning
for
example,
let’s
take
fh
prince
and
co.
inc.
fh
prince
and
co.
inc.
owned
100%
of
the
stock
of
the
usynt,
the
union
stock
yard
and
transit
company
in
chicago;
one
of
the
direct
prophylactic
provisions
of
this
decree
was
that
armour
would
have
no
relationship
with
a
stock
yard.
there’s
a
specific
provision
asking
for
divestiture
and
divestiture
occurred,
but
in
between
1958
and
1960,
fh
prince
and
co.
inc
had
controlling
interest
through
a
variety
of
prince
interests
of
armour,
and
also
own
100%
of
the
stock
of
the
usynt.
the
usynt
operates
restaurants.
all
these
facts
were
known
to
the
government
and
acquiesced
in
because
they
were
trying
the
modification
proceeding
in
chicago
during
the
same
period.
so,
you
have
a
decree
which
has
never
been
applied
in
50
years
to
investments
in
a
packer.
it
wasn’t
applied
when
morris
was
acquired,
a
signatory.
it
wasn’t
applied
when
fh
prince
and
co.
inc
owned
both
usynt
and
armour.
it
wasn’t
applied
in
the
ltv
litigation
in
which
ltv
owns
both
a
packer
and
a
corporation
that
deals
in
decree
products.
with
50
years
of
experience,
interpreting
the
decree
in
that
way,
under
the
atlantic
refining
case,
this
court’s
latest
decision
that
we
know
on
this
subject,
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
as
justice
black
suggested
in
that
case,
perhaps
modification
is
appropriate,
but
this
is
not
a
modification
proceeding.
this
is
a
proceeding
in
which
the
government
contends
that
the
purposes
they
see
in
this
decree,
purposes
that
go
back
to
1920,
control
the
anti-trust
issues
of
today.
we
have,
not
in
our
briefs,
attempted
to
answer
it,
but
many
references
outside
of
the
record
concerning
meat
and
other
food
facts
that
supposedly
control
the
anti
competitive
facts
in
the
meat
industry
today.
we
don’t
think
it
is
appropriate
to
put
in
briefs
in
this
court
a
lot
of
references
to
how
much
control
armour
does
or
doesn’t
have.
we
would
like
to
dispute
them.
we
don’t
think
that
the
meat
industry
has
anywhere
near
the
control
that
used
to
have,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that’s
an
irrelevant
point.
what
we
really
have
in
this
case
is
a
simple
issue
of
interpreting
the
decree
under
rule
65
(d).
why
does
the
government
not
proceed
under
rule
65
(d)?
they
admittedly
have
not.
they
admittedly
want
to
challenge
this
court’s
decision
like
in
atlantic
refining,
and
they
admittedly
want
to
take
a
different
position
in
this
case
than
they
have
in
other
cases.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
decree?
the
government
seems
to
be
able
to
read
out
of
the
decree
a
variety
of
purposes
which
we
can’t
find.
the
decree
itself
which
was
entered
in
1920
contains
an
express
provision
in
the
beginning
of
it
that
the
packers,
first
of
all,
deny
all
the
charges.
this
is
a
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
and
the
settlement
of
the
lawsuit
contains
in
it
an
express
provision
that
says
that
the
entry
of
a
settlement
decree
is
no
admission
on
their
part
that
they’ve
ever
violated
the
laws
or
have
monopolies.
this
decree
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
of
the
monopoly
ever
existed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
prophylactic
nature
of
this
decree
is
such
that
accretions
of
power
among
the
packers
are
included
in
its
prohibitions,
then
how
could
the
government,
three
years
after
the
ink
was
dry
on
this
decree,
permit
armour
to
acquire
morris?
and
if
that
is
so,
how
can
the
government
contend
against
greyhound
that
we
cannot
through
different
subsidiaries
own
a
packer
and
a
company
that
has
some
decree
products
when
they
permit
other
companies
too?
what
is
the
difference
between
the
board
of
directors
of
ltv
and
the
board
of
directors
of
greyhound?
we’re
not
saying
the
government
is
estopped.
if
they
want
to
let
ltv
conduct
their
affairs
that
way,
obviously,
that’s
their
right,
but
in
interpreting
the
decree
over
the
years
in
that
way,
under
this
court’s
decided
authority,
those
facts
are
material
in
determining
the
purposes
of
the
decree.
i
have
one
last
point.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
armour,
its
prophet
foods.
greyhound
has
another
subsidiary.
it
operates
in
the
food
business.
it’s
in
the
catering
business.
it
also
has
another
small
subsidiary
that
sells
food
as
an
accommodation
to
people
who
want
to
buy
food
when
they
stop
at
the
bus
line
out
in
omaha
or
some
place.
this
is
a
small
business.
it’s
part
of
an
adjunct
to
their
bus
business.
now,
if
the
court
is
going
to
except
the
government’s
arguments,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
as
we
stated
in
the
relief
paragraph
of
the
appeal
brief
is
that
we
divest
ourselves,
that
is
we
get
rid
of
say
prophet
foods.
this
is
not
an
antitrust
case,
there’s
no
finding
here
that
greyhound
has
violated
any
law.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
no,
your
honor.
we
have
--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
we
have
no
record.
i
believe
we
have
furnished
such
information
to
the
department
of
justice
in
their
investigation
of
this
case,
starting
out
as
a
section
7
investigation,
but
it’s
never
been
made
a
party
--
part
of
this
record,
but
more
than
that
mr.
chief
justice,
the
problem
here
is
not
one
of
an
anti-trust
violation.
there
are
references
in
this
appeal
to
reciprocity,
the
possible
control
of
prices
by
a
combination
between
armour
and
greyhound.
all
of
these
statements
are
not
in
the
record.
at
this
juncture
all
we
have
is
a
petition
filed
which
merely
states
that
they
want
a
subpoena
or
summons
issued
against
greyhound
under
section
5
of
the
sherman
act,
and
that
requires
a
finding
that
the
action
be
pending,
and
when
a
district
judge
who’s
had
a
lot
of
experience
in
this
matters,
repeatedly
asked
counsel
for
the
government,
to
give
me
some
authority
on
this;
they
cited
the
byre
(ph)
case.
the
byre
case
the
only
one
we
know
off,
but
in
that
case,
this
third
party
was
permitted
to
litigate
the
merits
of
the
original
decree.
that
can’t
perceivably
be
what
the
government
is
asking
for
in
this
case
and
yet,
it’s
the
only
case
that
could
be
cited
and
the
reason
is,
it’s
at
section
5
of
the
sherman
act
requires
a
finding
that
the
action
is
pending
before
summon
is
issued.
we
think
this
whole
business
of
possible
circumvention
of
antitrust
decree
is
a
rouse.
the
government
is
trying
to
create
a
noble
public
interest
objective
to
get
around
the
basic
rules
of
injunctions
that
apply
in
case
after
case
and
a
careful
reading
of
this
record
in
the
hearings
before
judge
hoffman.
judge
hoffman
is
a
seasoned
experienced
judge;
one
of
many
and
all
the
district
judges
have
problems
of
injunctions.
and
it’s
just
judge
hoffman
said
“what
am
i
to
do
in
the
next
injunction
case?
i
have
all
kinds
of
injunctions
over
my
experience
on
the
bench.
i
have
many
injunctions.
are
we
going
to
apply
these
rules
to
that
kind
of
a
case?”
the
government
in
this
case
is
actually
seeking
to
have
the
rules
that
normally
apply
in
injunctions
and
the
rules
that
they
have
permitted
to
apply
to
the
packers
decree
to
be
amended
in
this
proceeding.
thank
you.
