justice

white
mr.
springer,
what
would
be
the
major
problems
in
the
government's
section
7
suit
against
armour
and
greyhound?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
you
think
that
under
this
decree,
if
armour
went
out
and
was
in
the
process
of
purchasing
the
assets
of
a
company
in
a
forbidden
line
that
the
court
would
be
limited
to
enjoining
armour
from
doing
that.
it
couldn’t
issue
a
supplemental
order
against
the
putative
seller.
it
couldn’t
also
--
could
it
enjoin
both
armour
and
the
seller?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn’t
ask
about
an
original
action.
i
just
--
under
the
decree,
amour
is
forbidden
from
acquiring
some
company
of
a
--
of
certain
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it’s
in
the
process
of
acquiring
one
of
those
forbidden
companies,
could
the
court
issue
an
order
against
armour
and
also
the
possible
seller?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
want
know
what
your
opinion
was,
whether
the
order
could
run
against
the
seller
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
that
sense,
the
decree
wouldn’t
be
limited
only
to
armour?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
armour,
i
suppose
under
this
decree
couldn’t
acquire
greyhound,
could
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
armour
said
“well,
i
can
acquire
you,
but
you
can
acquire
me,
why
don’t
you
do
that?”
then
65
(d)
would
be
--
would
come
into
play,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
circumstance,
though
you
would
say
that
in
order
to
grant
against
greyhound
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
as
long
as
armour
is
passive
and
doesn’t
take
it
up
in
the
first
place,
an
order
may
not
run
against
greyhound?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
this
case
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
then
appropriate
as
a
remedy
in
this
case
if
the
--
for
the
trial
court
in
1920
to
have
said
armour
shall
not
acquire
anyone
--
this
forbidden
lines
and
neither
shall
armour
be
acquired
by
anybody
in
the
--
those
forbidden
lines?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wouldn’t
be
binding
until
somebody
--
but
let’s
assume
what
happen.
somebody
acquired
armour
like
this,
like
in
this
case,

you
think
that
court
would
be
