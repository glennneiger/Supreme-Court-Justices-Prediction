do
you
think
the
original

another

he
himself
just
passing
on

white
you
don’t
think
the

let’s
assume
the

determination
and
have
reviewed
it

the

wouldn’t
have
to
rehear
the
unfair
labor
practice
--
the
representation
issue,
would
it?
justice
byron

white
so
your

is
no?
justice

and
so
you
say
but
you
say
the

finality
as
the

says
on
the

justice

white
well,
alright
but
--
justice
byron

though.
and
if
the

had
made
the
representation
determination
it
wouldn’t
have
to
do
it
again
in
the
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron

i
know
but
--
justice
byron

white
but
the
act
--
the
section
says
the
regional

is
the
board
for
this
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
discretion
of
the

not
to
take

cases
doesn’t
mean
very
much
that
they’re
going
to
have
to
take
them
and
decided
one
on
the
unfair
labor
practice
that
unfair
labor

stay?
justice

white
well,
it
may
be
but
they
didn’t
take
this

well,
maybe
if
they
may
be
right
i
was
just
curious
to
know
why
