justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don’t
suppose
the
board
that
reviews
every
case
it
thinks
is
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
well
again
i’ll
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
the
error
in
this
case
since
the
board
had
never
looked
at
a
scrap
of
what
was
before
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
just
say
that
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
case
really
doesn’t
depend
on
how
much
the
board
to
looked
at
the
regional
director’s
determination,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
be
in
trouble
for
getting
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
the
board
sweep
the
child
examiner's
findings
in
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
the
standard
that
the
board
applies
when
it
does
like
this?
justice
potter
stewart
preponderance?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
gather
in
this
case
the
trial
examiners
findings
included
the
regional
director’s
findings
to
be
applied
on
the
representation
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
this
a
different
--
i
suppose,
if
i
gather
an
exemption
was
taken
to
those
claim
in
the
trial
examiner’s
findings
to
the
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
what’s
the
standard
that
the
board
applies
to
that
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that’s
the
corporate
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
he
files
his
findings
in
these
cases,
do
they
not
include
the
findings
in
the
representation?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
want
to
get.
justice
potter
stewart
so
even
though
they’re
in
the
trial
examiner’s
findings
to
this
extent
that
you
told
us,
the
application
to
preponderance
to
the
evidence
who
does
not
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
before
its
3
(b)?
justice
potter
stewart
before
3
(b)
of
course
that
was
the
board
that
mean
it
wasn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
circumstance
of
course,
you
wouldn’t
expect
the
board
to
go
back
over
it
again,
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear
now
that
they
apply
the
same
rule
to
the
regional
director’s
findings
as
they
used
to
apply
the
wrong
which
is
they
don’t
review
them
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
this
curiosity
that
you
say
the
board
in
reviewing
the
trial
examiner's
findings
really
makes
a
preponderance
for
the
evidence
determination?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
a
theory
of
clearly
erroneous
standard
or
substantial
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
actually
stated
themselves
that
we
have
the
same
findings
the
trial
examiner
made?
justice
potter
stewart
stop
right
there
mr.
come,
if
they
had
come
before
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
would
have
been
a
predetermination
for
instance
by
the
trial
examiner
of
representation
case?
justice

stewart
well,
i
don’t
