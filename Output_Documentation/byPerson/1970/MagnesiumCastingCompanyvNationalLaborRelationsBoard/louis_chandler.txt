mr.
louis
chandler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
be
a
relatively
simple
issue
that
we
have
because
we
stated
it
is
whether
or
not
the
national
labor
relations
board
may
enforce
a
decision
and
order
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
which
is
based
upon
evidence
in
the
transcript
that
it
has
never
considered
or
reviewed
and
based
upon
a
conflicting
testimony
by
witnesses
that
the
board
or
its
trial
examiner
neither
heard
or
observed.
the
background
of
this
case
involves
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
an
election
by
a
union
and
a
so-called
representation
case
called
in
our
case
and
appellants
of
the
trade
as
distinguished
from
a
“c”
case
which
is
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
and
the
hearing
was
held,
conflicting
evidence
was
presented
and
one
of
the
questions
involved
particularly
whether
or
not
the
assistant
foremen
were
supervisors.
the
question
involves
some
questions
of
credibility
because
there
was
conflicting
testimony.
and
this
question
as
to
supervisors
became
critical
because
the
company
had
evidence
that
an
employee
that
it
contended
was
a
supervisor
was
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
union
in
soliciting
authorization
cards
for
the
union.
this
would
taint
the
interest
of
the
union
because
the
board
has
held
that
the
solicitation
of
cards
by
an
employee
or
representative
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
is
coercive
and
it
does
not
permit
of
a
free
choice
by
employees
of
that
collective
bargaining
agent.
one
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
that
case
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
and
under
the
labor
management
relations
act,
a
representation
case
is
called
an
investigation
and
the
results
are
not
called
a
decision
but
a
certification
and
it
was
interesting
to
hear
the
prior
case
where
there
is
a
certification
of
the
results.
and
the
hearing
officer
will
be
noted
in
the
representation
hearing
on
the
magnesium
case
set
on
page
79
of
the
record
appendix
is,
we
are
in
a
none
adversary
proceeding.
the
hearing
in
a
representation
case
is
not
subject
to
any
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
this
is
in
the
rules
and
regulation
102.66
or
to
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
there
was
a
specific
exemption
section
5
to
the
certification
of
employee
representatives
but
not
as
to
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
hearing
officer
is
actually
one
of
the
staff
in
the
regional
office
designated
by
the
regional
director.
he
is
not
appointed
under
the
rules
established
for
the
appointment
of
hearing
officers
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
he
has
no
authority
to
make
recommendations
findings
of
fact,
rulings
of
law
or
determinations
of
credibility.
the
only
reason
that
a
representations
case
is
handled
in
this
manner
is
to
expedite
the
processing
of
elections
and
representation
matters
and
because
in
1959
under
the
act
called
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
amended
the
taft-hartley
act
of
1947.
section
3
(b)
was
one
of
the
amendments
which
authorized
the
board
to
delegate
its
section
9
functions.
section
9
function
is
only
on
representation
matters
as
distinguished
from
section
10
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
delegated
section
9
functions
only
as
to
representation
cases
to
its
regional
directors
are
retaining
discretionary
powers
of
review.
now,
there’s
no
authority
for
the
board
to
delegate
to
a
regional
director.
the
board’s
obligation
to
make
the
findings
that
are
required
of
unfair
labor
practices
brought
under
section
10
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
make
this
more
binding
section
3
(b)
in
the
amendment
said,
that
the
board
could
delegate
any
of
its
other
powers
to
a
three-man
panel
of
the
board.
the
regional
director,
in
any
event,
presumably
after
reading
the
record
because
he
wasn’t
present
at
the
hearing
and
the
statute
says
that
the
staff
employee
who
was
assigned
as
the
hearing
officer
may
not
make
any
recommendations,
so
he
wasn’t
able
to
evaluate
by
the
appearance
of
the
witnesses
or
by
observing
or
listening
to
witness
the
credibility.
in
any
event
presumably
after
reading
the
record
and
without
seeing
these
witnesses
may
it
finds
the
credibility
against
the
employer’s
position
and
ruled
that
certain
assistant
foremen
contended
to
be
supervisors
by
the
employer
were
not
supervisors.
and
then,
another
assistant
foreman
was
in
fact
a
supervisor.
and
his
decision
referred
mainly
to
record
statements
that
were
adverse
to
the
employer’s
position
and
also
more
particularly
to
mr.
scott’s
testimony.
and
he
said
at
one
point
that
scott
himself
testified
that
he
wasn’t
a
foreman
and
yet
he
left
out
of
his
decision
substantial
testimony
not
only
given
by
the
employer
and
the
employer
witnesses
but
by
scott
himself
in
which
scott
made
many,
many
statements
about
his
supervisory
functions
and
without
trying
to
develop
them
because
this
isn’t
the
forum
for
that.
on
page
88,
scott
and
this
is
in
the
record
appendix
that
he
recommended
a
raise
to
employees.
he
regularly
attended
the
supervisor’s
meetings,
page
84.
he
said,
“i
have
the
right
to
fire
if
i
didn’t
want
a
man
i
will
get
rid
of
him”
page
85.
page
89,
“i
am
in
charge
of
two
and
sometimes
three
employees
but
he
agreed
he
was
running
the
room.”
he
had
charge
with
the
employees,
gave
disciplinary
warnings,

testimony
by
one
foreman
that
all
assistant
foremen
were
told
they
have
authority
to
discharge
in
page
105.
none
of
this
appears
into
decision
of
the
regional
director
who
had
the
transfer
confronted
them
presumably.
in
any
event,
subsequent
through
his
decision
these
conflicts
in
scott’s
testimony
and
the
contrary
testimony
of
other
witnesses
were
called
to
the
board’s
attention
in
a
motion
to
review
and
the
board
refused
to
review
because
that
has
set
up
standard
in
a
representation
case.
now,
we
can't
quarrel
with
them
because
the
statute
gives
a
board
the
authority
to
set
up
this
stand
with
and
give
them
discretionary
review
in
a
representation
case
saying
that
must
be
compelling
reasons
and
it
relates
to
board
policy
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
the
board
refused
to
review.
the
election
results
then
were
certified
and
the
union
was
certified
as
the
bargaining
agent.
and
the
company
position
having
bend
that
the
employees
were
coerced
because
of
the
supervisors
organizational
activities
on
behalf
of
the
union
and
under
law
in
case
history,
the
only
method
for
raising
this
issue
was
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
a
complaint
would
issue
and
this
is
what
was
done
so
that
the
employer
could
have
a
determination
under
section
10
of
the
act.
there
was
no
burden
of
proof
incidentally
on
the
board
or
its
agents
in
a
representation
case
it’s
an
investigation.
the
only
standard
is
whether
there
was
a
question
of
representation
whether
an
unfair
labor
practice
case,
the
burden
is
on
the
general
counsel
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
exists.
the
burden
is
not
on
the
party
to
disprove
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
this
is
the
distinction
when
the
board
refers
back
to
the
motion
for
review
and
says
you
prove
to
us
and
give
us
all
the
evidence
you
can
marshal
that
you
have
reason
to
reverse
the
regional
director’s
decision.
section
10
is
not
investigative
it
is
advisory
and
it
relates
to
the
handling
of
these
“c”
cases.
findings
of
violations

the
respondent
to
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
injunctive
penalties
including
possible
contempt.
it
requires
the
board
to
consider
the
evidence
and
to
consider
the
evidence
under
the
rules
of
evidence
of
the
u.s.
district
courts.
these
rules
do
not
pertain
in
the
representation
case.
it
requires
that
the
board
exercise
its
own
independent
judgment
and
under
10
(c)
to
make
its
own
finding
and
conclusions
on
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
taken
before
it
can
enter
a
bargaining
order.
and
of
course
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
applicable,
this
court
has
so
ruled
on
mastro
plastics
and
that
requires
that
all
agency
decisions
include
the
statement
of
the
findings
and
conclusions
and
the
reasons
of
basis
therefore
and
all
the
material
issues
or
fact
and
law
were
discretion
presented
on
a
record.
when
the
board’s
trial
examiner
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
after
general
counsel
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
unfair
practice
case.
the
employer
objected
on
the
basis
that
the
evidence
of
supervisory
status,
all
of
the
evidence
should
be
reviewed
by
the
board
of
by
a
trial
examiner
designated
under
the
rules
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
incidentally,
just
about
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
this
order
to
show
cause
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
employer,
petitioner
learned
that
the
witness
scott
some
of
who’s
testimony
had
been
accepted
from
the
transcript
by
the
regional
director
and
relied
upon
had
admitted
after
the
representation
hearing
that
he
have
been
less
than
truthful
and
had
withheld
information
at
the
representation
hearing.
the
employer
called
this
to
the
attention.
mr.
louis
chandler
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
louis
chandler
it
develop
because
the
assistant
foreman
told
--
mr.
louis
chandler
how
did
it
get
in
a
record?
the
petitioner,
respondent
employer
at
that
time
made
a
motion
stating
that
the
witness
scott
admittedly
had
withheld
information
and
requested
a
reopening
of
a
record
without
getting
into
the
details
of
what
the
information
was.
there
were
some
concern
and
these
rather
emotionally
charge
situations
as
to
pressures
being
brought
on
witnesses
from
like
subsequently
testify
and
to
give
names.
mr.
louis
chandler
the
examiner
said
that
this
doesn’t
mean
anything
to
me.
he
said
you
haven’t
said
anything
that
would
--
it
stated
on
the
brief
or
rather
in
the
record
appendix
--
mr.
louis
chandler
we’ll
find
it.
in
the
meantime,
we’ll
come
back.
thank
you,
sir.
we
asked
for
the
opportunity
to
present
facts
on
the
issue
and
the
trial
examiner
refused
to
take
evidence
or
to
review
the
record
and
he
therefore
could
make
no
independent
findings
or
fact
or
on
credibility
and
he
merely
affirmed
the
regional
director’s
decision
on
the
basis
that
the
board
had
refused
to
review.
the
employer
file
the
exceptions
that
are
required
under
the
acts
and
the
board
on
a
sharp
one-page
decision
really
rubber
stamp
the
trial
examiner’s
decision
who
in
turn
have
rubber
stamp
the
to
regional
director’s
decision.
and
the
first
circuit
court
when
it
ordered
enforcement
of
the
bargaining
order,
admitted
that
the
issue
was
a
difficult
one
and
used
the
term
there
are
gradations
of
authority
and
it
is
a
difficult
decision
but
that
they
were
deferring
to
the
board’s
expertise.
it’s
an
interesting
term
because
they
should
have
defer
to
the
board’s
expertise
but
the
board’s
expertise
wasn’t
involved
here
because
the
board
had
neglected
to
perform
the
duties
that
were
require
of
it
often
under
section
10.
it
was
the
regional
director
who
had
made
some
kind
of
determination
based
upon
a
reading
of
a
transcript.
the
portion
on
the
request
for
commission
to
produce
the
evidence
the
only
construction
that
i
can
make
for
respondents
reply,
this
is
the
trial
exam
i'm
talking
that
it
views
scott’s
admission
as
newly
discovered
evidence.
however
--
mr.
louis
chandler
i'm
reading
on
page
164.
respondent
furnishes
no
support
for
it's
contention
other
than
offering
to
prove
on
full
hearing
that
scott
had
supervisory
authority
and
did
various
acts
consistent
thereto.
and
he
goes
on,
into
what
extent
such
evidence
as
new
is
impossible
to
determine
other
than
scott’s
admission
which
presumably
came
after
the
hearing
and
of
for
which
we
know
nothing
or
i
would
ask
the
trial
examiner
how
could
he
know
anything
about
it
if
we
know
nothing
about
it
until
after
the
hearing,
and
how
could
he
learn
anything
about
it
unless
since
it
was
newly
discovered
evidence
he
would
give
us
the
opportunity
to
present
it.
mr.
louis
chandler
no,
i
don’t.
the
acts
provides
that
it
be
a
hearing
officer
or
staff
employee
but
it
also
provides
that
he
may
make
no
recommendations
and
that
the
regional
director
will
make
the
decision
but
the
important
aspect
of
this
is
that
it’s
really
investigatory
and
it
results
as
i
said
in
a
certification
and
it
contemplates
that
ultimately.
the
intent
of
congress
is
that
a
charge
will
be
filed
and
at
least
this
expedites
the
representation
area
of
the
proceedings
so
that
the
election
can
be
governed
over
with
and
if
there
were
issues
they
will
be
raise
in
the
complaint
case.
i
say
that
the
board
violated
the
act
by
adopting
the
regional
director’s
decision
and
applying
it
in
the
“c”
case
without
an
independent
--
mr.
louis
chandler
--
evaluation
of
facts.
mr.
louis
chandler
if
it’s
not
appeal
--
mr.
louis
chandler
if
there
has
been
an
independent
review
by
the
board.
mr.
louis
chandler
the
answer
is
i
would
expect
to
comply
with
the
board’s
determination
in
that
case
unless
they
were
newly
discovered
evidence.
mr.
louis
chandler
that
is
right
because
there
hasn’t
been
an
independent
review
that
applies
to
the
“c”
portion
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
chandler
only
for
representations
cases.
mr.
louis
chandler
but
not
when
it
comes
to
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
louis
chandler
but
they
would
have
it
examined
the
entire
record
and
that’s
my
point.
mr.
louis
chandler
but
they’ve
refuse
to
examine
the
record.
mr.
louis
chandler
only
for
that
purpose
of
representation
but
not
for
charge
cases
and
if
we
have
a
complaint
case
the
board
must
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
and
when
they
put
--
they
shifted
the
burden
in
the
motion
for
review
when
they
said
to
the
employer
and
they
say
to
any
party
filing
a
motion
for
review.
you
prove
to
us
by
compelling
reasons
that
the
regional
director
is
wrong.
they
shifted
the
burden
that
is
on
them
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
has
been
committed.
there’s
a
difference
in
the
burden
that
is
required
between
a
representation
issue
and
a
trial.
mr.
louis
chandler
and
50%
of
those
that
they
took
and
the
last
records
that
were
available
from
the
board,
they
reversed
the
regional
director.
mr.
louis
chandler
and
they
didn’t
take
case
and
they
didn’t
look
at
the
evidence
and
i
submit
sir,
that
the
section
10
of
the
act
requires
that
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
they
must
look
at
the
record
and
that
the
at
the
trial
examiner
is,
i
mean
the
regional
director
is
not
the
board
for
unfair
labor
practice
purposes;
for
representation
cases,
yes,
to
process
up
through
to
the
time
of
the
elections.
mr.
louis
chandler
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
short
time
remaining
until
three,
i
like
to
quote
from
judge
kaufman’s
statement
in
pepsi
cola
case
on
the
second
circuit
where
he
says,
that
the
board
procedure
for
review
under
102.67
which
is
exactly
what
we’re
talking
about
is
even
more
cursory
than
certiorari
since
the
petition
for
review
must
be
a
self-contained
document
cut
adrift
from
the
record.
in
certiorari,
the
record
is
certified
to
the
higher
court
for
examination
that
for
consideration
with
the
petition
and
the
shift
of
responsibility
is
improper
because
the
there’s
preponderance
of
evidence
required.
in
the
--
mr.
louis
chandler
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
louis
chandler
not
behind,
this
is
what
we
were
going
to
get
to,
the
--
mr.
louis
chandler
thank
you.
mr.
louis
chandler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
like
quote
judge
coffman
in
the
pepsi
cola
decision
as
to
the
requirements
the
court’s
consideration
of
the
record
and
the
board’s
findings
under
section
10.
he
states
in
an
unfair
practice
proceeding,
the
board
cannot
completely
advocate
its
responsibility
to
a
regional
director
a
functionary
whose
appointment
is
not
even
subject
to
consideration
by
the
senate
as
are
those
of
board
members.
moreover
the
board’s
experience
is
particularly
relevant
and
desirable
in
deciding
complex
issues
relating
to
the
appropriate
bargaining
unit
before
the
potent
sanctions
arising
from
the
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
are
invoked.
where
the
choices
between
two
fairly
conflicting
views,
the
court
must
defer
to
the
board’s
decision.
but
here,
the
board
has
not
actually
considered
the
questions
of
fact
in
law.
the
board
has
merely
rubber-stamped
his
decision
and
thus
the
regional
director’s
decision
was
perpetuated
even
though
it
may
have
been
in
fact
wrong
and
we
too
would
be
blindly
endorsing
the
question
about
result.
such
difference
to
the
regional
director
was
not
intended
by
congress,
it
decided
that
the
board
itself
must
grow
whether
a
litigant
has
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice,
we
see
no
basis
for
thus
mutilating
the
legislative
scheme.
and
judge
butzner
and
the
claimant
wife
said
in
a
case
that
also
involved
the
use
of
summary
judgment
that
the
use
of
summary
judgment
in
deciding
whether
an
employer
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
does
not
exempt
the
board
from
complying
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
the
board’s
earlier
consideration
of
the
company’s
request
for
review
of
the
regional
director’s
decision,
does
not
supply
the
deficiency.
for
them,
the
board
as
in
the
magnesium
case
simply
denied
the
request
–
that
was
my
interpolation
simply
denied
the
request
with
the
observation
that
it
raised
no
substantial
issues,
warrants
and
review.
the
board
is
charged
with
a
duty
of
stating
the
reasons
why
the
board
concluded
the
facts
that
showed
a
violation
of
law.
no
statutory
exception
to
this
rule
exist
because
critical
elements
of
the
controversy
were
determined
preliminarily
by
the
regional
director
and
the
representation
proceedings.
the
board,
not
the
regional
director
has
the
responsibility
of
deciding
complaints
--
mr.
louis
chandler
i
think
the
substantial
portion
of
it
would,
because
the
regional
director
based
his
decision
substantially
upon
the
evidence
testimony
given
by
the
witness
who
subsequently
stated,
admitted.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
think
the
fact
that
he
admitted
that
he
had
withheld
information
at
the
hearing
before
the
regional
director
would
be
that
kind
of
strong
evidence
sir.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
in
this
sense
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
review
must
under
section
10
(e)
as
it
reads
and
as
i
interpreted
include
a
review
of
the
board
findings
as
well
as
making
a
determination
based
upon
substantial
evidence
on
the
record.
and
the
board
findings
are
as
set
forth
as
required
in
section
10
(c)
requiring
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
be
used
by
the
board
in
making
its
determination
so
that
they
must
be
read
together
and
in
an
analysis
by
the
bureau
of
national
affairs
made
on
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
1946,
they
have
a
specific
reference
to
the
exceptions
to
the
apa
under
a
comment
in
section
5
which
talks
about
the
division
of
fall
as
between
the
functionaries
like
the
regional
director
and
board
members
even
on
the
exceptions
and
one
exception
if
you
recall
was
that
relating
to
the
certification
of
employee
representatives.
and
then
the
analysis
the
bna
says
with
respect
to
the
accepted
matters.
the
senate
judiciary
committee
emphasizes
that
administrative
agency
should
not
apply
the
exemption
to
such
cases
as
tend
to
be
accusatory
in
form
and
involved
sharply
controverted
factual
issues
since
the
prescribed
exceptions
are
not
to
be
interpreted
as
precluding
the
statutory
procedure
under
apa
where
it
is
required.
and
i
submit
sir
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
delays
inherent
in
the
board’s
refusal
independently
to
review
the
evidence
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
so
that
the
boards
would
feel
--
the
board
would
feel
--
the
parties
rather
would
feel
compelled
to
take
the
cases
to
a
circuit
court
to
secure
their
first
review
of
all
the
evidence
presented
at
the
regional
director
level
or
being
on
a
substantial
rather
than
the
preponderance
of
evidence
test
as
the
statute
provides.
mr.
louis
chandler
not
on
the
basis
that
the
law
provided
for,
congress
provided
that
a
preponderance
of
evidence
test
first
be
applied
by
the
board.
that’s
in
section
10
(c).
the
court
reviews
it
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence
and
then
not
reviewing
the
board’s
finding
so
that
the
parties
i
submit
are
being
deprived
of
their
rights
under
the
act.
and
also
of
course
under
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
judge
coffman
in
relying
--
mr.
louis
chandler
yes
i
do
that,
i
agree
that
they
were
reviewed.
mr.
louis
chandler
expressly
and
this
is
what
i
quarrel
with
because
when
judge
coffman
states
that
a
difficult
question
was
involved
and
that
he
was
relying
on
the
expertise
of
the
regional
director
which
is
set
forth
in
record
appendix
page
205
and
states
at
the
last
page
of
his
decision
that
perhaps
the
board
ruled
or
determined
in
its
own
mind
that
it
was
not
a
difficult
question.
i
don’t
believe
that
party
should
have
to
rely
on
the
judge’s
speculation
as
to
the
reason
for
the
board’s
action.
mr.
louis
chandler
on
page
205
of
the
record
appendix,
he
so
indicated
because
there
was
no
expertise
of
the
board
involved
based
upon
all
of
the
evidence
because
they
refused
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
that
pittsburgh
plate
glass
which
is
the
only
case
upon
which
the
board
relies
was
decided
1941
and
in
that
case
the
board
made
its
own
findings
on
the
representation
case
after
the
board
members
reviewed
the
evidence
and
it
was
decided
five
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1961,
the
board
attempted
by
the
means
of
the
reorganization
plan
number
five
to
get
permission
to
delegate
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
and
congress
rejected
this
proposal
and
the
board
should
not
now
be
permitted
to
accomplish
administratively
what
it
could
not
persuade
congress
to
do.
the
desire
to
expedite
does
not
give
the
board
the
right
to
legislate
from
the
sense
a
waiver
rights
of
the
parties
or
to
refuse
to
consider
pertinent
and
vital
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
board
so
called
rule
against
litigation
when
applied
in
this
manner
is
directly
contrary
to
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
and
a
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
would
like
to
call
this
honorable
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
electronic
alloys
in
183
nlrb
14,
which
was
also
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
that
arose
from
refusal
to
bargain
after
the
board
refused
to
review
the
regional
director’s
decision
on
an
appropriate
unit.
and
the
board
stated
in
that
unfair
labor
practice
case
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
respondent’s
response
to
the
notice
to
show
cause.
the
respondent
contends
that
the
board
has
never
independently
reviewed
the
record
to
determine
whether
the
regional
director
was
correct
in
concluding
that
the
unit
is
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
we
have
examined
the
decision
and
direction
of
election
in
that
case,
we
have
made
an
independent
review
of
the
record
in
that
case
and
hold
that
the
regional
director’s
findings
and
conclusions
are
correct.
there's
a
footnote
and
they
point
to
some
findings
that
they
disagree
with,
that
do
not
affect
the
correctness
of
its
ultimate
conclusion
that
there
is
an
appropriate
unit
and
say
accordingly
as
now
all
issues
have
been
fully
litigated
and
no
newly
discovered
or
previously
unavailable
evidence
is
offered,
no
further
hearing
is
required
and
we
shall
therefore
grant
the
general
counsel’s
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
board
thus
acknowledges
that
while
the
review
of
a
regional
director’s
decision
in
a
representation
case
maybe
discretionary.
independent
board
review
is
required,
should
the
representation
case
ripen
into
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
and
the
petitioner
here
is
entitled
for
no
less
if
the
law
was
to
be
administered
fairly
and
without
discrimination
and
the
petitioner
respectfully
urges
that
the
enforcement
decree
be
vacated.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
louis
chandler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
be
a
relatively
simple
issue
that
we
have
because
we
stated
it
is
whether
or
not
the
national
labor
relations
board
may
enforce
a
decision
and
order
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
which
is
based
upon
evidence
in
the
transcript
that
it
has
never
considered
or
reviewed
and
based
upon
a
conflicting
testimony
by
witnesses
that
the
board
or
its
trial
examiner
neither
heard
or
observed.
the
background
of
this
case
involves
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
an
election
by
a
union
and
a
so-called
representation
case
called
in
our
case
and
appellants
of
the
trade
as
distinguished
from
a
“c”
case
which
is
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
and
the
hearing
was
held,
conflicting
evidence
was
presented
and
one
of
the
questions
involved
particularly
whether
or
not
the
assistant
foremen
were
supervisors.
the
question
involves
some
questions
of
credibility
because
there
was
conflicting
testimony.
and
this
question
as
to
supervisors
became
critical
because
the
company
had
evidence
that
an
employee
that
it
contended
was
a
supervisor
was
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
union
in
soliciting
authorization
cards
for
the
union.
this
would
taint
the
interest
of
the
union
because
the
board
has
held
that
the
solicitation
of
cards
by
an
employee
or
representative
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
is
coercive
and
it
does
not
permit
of
a
free
choice
by
employees
of
that
collective
bargaining
agent.
one
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
that
case
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
and
under
the
labor
management
relations
act,
a
representation
case
is
called
an
investigation
and
the
results
are
not
called
a
decision
but
a
certification
and
it
was
interesting
to
hear
the
prior
case
where
there
is
a
certification
of
the
results.
and
the
hearing
officer
will
be
noted
in
the
representation
hearing
on
the
magnesium
case
set
on
page
79
of
the
record
appendix
is,
we
are
in
a
none
adversary
proceeding.
the
hearing
in
a
representation
case
is
not
subject
to
any
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
this
is
in
the
rules
and
regulation
102.66
or
to
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
there
was
a
specific
exemption
section
5
to
the
certification
of
employee
representatives
but
not
as
to
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
hearing
officer
is
actually
one
of
the
staff
in
the
regional
office
designated
by
the
regional
director.
he
is
not
appointed
under
the
rules
established
for
the
appointment
of
hearing
officers
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
he
has
no
authority
to
make
recommendations
findings
of
fact,
rulings
of
law
or
determinations
of
credibility.
the
only
reason
that
a
representations
case
is
handled
in
this
manner
is
to
expedite
the
processing
of
elections
and
representation
matters
and
because
in
1959
under
the
act
called
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
amended
the
taft-hartley
act
of
1947.
section
3
(b)
was
one
of
the
amendments
which
authorized
the
board
to
delegate
its
section
9
functions.
section
9
function
is
only
on
representation
matters
as
distinguished
from
section
10
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
delegated
section
9
functions
only
as
to
representation
cases
to
its
regional
directors
are
retaining
discretionary
powers
of
review.
now,
there’s
no
authority
for
the
board
to
delegate
to
a
regional
director.
the
board’s
obligation
to
make
the
findings
that
are
required
of
unfair
labor
practices
brought
under
section
10
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
make
this
more
binding
section
3
(b)
in
the
amendment
said,
that
the
board
could
delegate
any
of
its
other
powers
to
a
three-man
panel
of
the
board.
the
regional
director,
in
any
event,
presumably
after
reading
the
record
because
he
wasn’t
present
at
the
hearing
and
the
statute
says
that
the
staff
employee
who
was
assigned
as
the
hearing
officer
may
not
make
any
recommendations,
so
he
wasn’t
able
to
evaluate
by
the
appearance
of
the
witnesses
or
by
observing
or
listening
to
witness
the
credibility.
in
any
event
presumably
after
reading
the
record
and
without
seeing
these
witnesses
may
it
finds
the
credibility
against
the
employer’s
position
and
ruled
that
certain
assistant
foremen
contended
to
be
supervisors
by
the
employer
were
not
supervisors.
and
then,
another
assistant
foreman
was
in
fact
a
supervisor.
and
his
decision
referred
mainly
to
record
statements
that
were
adverse
to
the
employer’s
position
and
also
more
particularly
to
mr.
scott’s
testimony.
and
he
said
at
one
point
that
scott
himself
testified
that
he
wasn’t
a
foreman
and
yet
he
left
out
of
his
decision
substantial
testimony
not
only
given
by
the
employer
and
the
employer
witnesses
but
by
scott
himself
in
which
scott
made
many,
many
statements
about
his
supervisory
functions
and
without
trying
to
develop
them
because
this
isn’t
the
forum
for
that.
on
page
88,
scott
and
this
is
in
the
record
appendix
that
he
recommended
a
raise
to
employees.
he
regularly
attended
the
supervisor’s
meetings,
page
84.
he
said,
“i
have
the
right
to
fire
if
i
didn’t
want
a
man
i
will
get
rid
of
him”
page

page
89,
“i
am
in
charge
of
two
and
sometimes
three
employees
but
he
agreed
he
was
running
the
room.”
he
had
charge
with
the
employees,
gave

warnings,

testimony
by
one
foreman
that
all
assistant
foremen
were
told
they
have
authority
to
discharge
in
page
105.
none
of
this
appears
into
decision
of
the
regional
director
who
had
the
transfer
confronted
them
presumably.
in
any
event,
subsequent
through
his
decision
these
conflicts
in
scott’s
testimony
and
the
contrary
testimony
of
other
witnesses
were
called
to
the
board’s
attention
in
a
motion
to
review
and
the
board
refused
to
review
because
that
has
set
up
standard
in
a
representation
case.
now,
we
can't
quarrel
with
them
because
the
statute
gives
a
board
the
authority
to
set
up
this
stand
with
and
give
them
discretionary
review
in
a
representation
case
saying
that
must
be
compelling
reasons
and
it
relates
to
board
policy
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
the
board
refused
to
review.
the
election
results
then
were
certified
and
the
union
was
certified
as
the
bargaining
agent.
and
the
company
position
having
bend
that
the
employees
were
coerced
because
of
the
supervisors
organizational
activities
on
behalf
of
the
union
and
under
law
in
case
history,
the
only
method
for
raising
this
issue
was
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
a
complaint
would
issue
and
this
is
what
was
done
so
that
the
employer
could
have
a
determination
under
section
10
of
the
act.
there
was
no
burden
of
proof
incidentally
on
the
board
or
its
agents
in
a
representation
case
it’s
an
investigation.
the
only
standard
is
whether
there
was
a
question
of
representation
whether
an
unfair
labor
practice
case,
the
burden
is
on
the
general
counsel
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
exists.
the
burden
is
not
on
the
party
to
disprove
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
this
is
the
distinction
when
the
board
refers
back
to
the
motion
for
review
and
says
you
prove
to
us
and
give
us
all
the
evidence
you
can
marshal
that
you
have
reason
to
reverse
the
regional
director’s
decision.
section

when
the
board’s
trial
examiner
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
after
general
counsel
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
unfair
practice
case.
the
employer
objected
on
the
basis
that
the
evidence
of
supervisory
status,
all
of
the
evidence
should
be
reviewed
by
the
board
of
by

examiner
designated

and
incidentally,
just
about
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
this
order
to
show
cause
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
employer,
petitioner
learned
that
the
witness
scott
some
of
who’s
testimony
had
been
accepted
from
the
transcript
by
the
regional
director
and
relied
upon
had
admitted
after
the
representation
hearing
that
he
have
been
less
than
truthful
and
had
withheld
information
at
the
representation
hearing.
the
employer
called
this
to
the
attention.
mr.
louis
chandler
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
louis
chandler
it
develop
because
the
assistant
foreman
told
--
mr.
louis
chandler
how
did
it
get
in
a
record?
the
petitioner,
respondent
employer
at
that
time
made
a
motion
stating
that
the
witness
scott
admittedly
had
withheld
information
and
requested
a
reopening
of
a
record
without
getting
into
the
details
of
what
the
information
was.
there
were
some
concern
and
these
rather
emotionally
charge
situations
as
to
pressures
being
brought
on
witnesses
from
like
subsequently
testify
and
to
give
names.
mr.
louis
chandler
the
examiner
said
that
this
doesn’t
mean
anything
to
me.
he
said
you
haven’t
said
anything
that
would
--
it
stated
on
the
brief
or
rather
in
the
record
appendix
--
mr.
louis
chandler
we’ll
find
it.
in
the
meantime,
we’ll
come
back.
thank
you,
sir.
we
asked
for
the
opportunity
to
present
facts
on
the
issue
and
the
trial
examiner
refused
to
take
evidence
or
to
review
the
record
and
he
therefore
could
make
no
independent
findings
or
fact
or
on
credibility
and
he
merely
affirmed
the
regional
director’s
decision
on
the
basis
that
the
board
had
refused
to
review.
the
employer
file
the
exceptions
that
are
required
under
the
acts
and
the
board
on
a
sharp
one-page
decision
really
rubber
stamp
the
trial
examiner’s
decision
who
in
turn
have
rubber
stamp
the
to
regional
director’s
decision.
and
the
first
circuit
court
when
it
ordered
enforcement
of
the
bargaining
order,
admitted
that
the
issue
was
a
difficult
one
and
used
the
term
there
are
gradations
of
authority
and
it
is
a
difficult
decision
but
that
they
were
deferring
to
the
board’s
expertise.
it’s
an
interesting
term
because
they
should
have
defer
to
the
board’s
expertise
but
the
board’s
expertise
wasn’t
involved
here
because
the
board
had
neglected
to
perform
the
duties
that
were
require
of
it
often
under
section
10.
it
was
the
regional
director
who
had
made
some
kind
of
determination
based
upon
a
reading
of
a
transcript.
the
portion
on
the
request
for
commission
to
produce
the
evidence
the
only
construction
that
i
can
make
for
respondents
reply,
this
is
the
trial
exam
i'm
talking
that
it
views
scott’s
admission
as
newly
discovered
evidence.
however
--
mr.
louis
chandler
i'm
reading
on
page
164.
respondent
furnishes
no
support
for
it's
contention
other
than
offering
to
prove
on
full
hearing
that
scott
had
supervisory
authority
and
did
various
acts
consistent
thereto.
and
he
goes
on,
into
what
extent
such
evidence
as
new
is
impossible
to
determine
other
than
scott’s
admission
which
presumably
came
after
the
hearing
and
of
for
which
we
know
nothing
or
i
would
ask
the
trial
examiner
how
could
he
know
anything
about
it
if
we
know
nothing
about
it
until
after
the
hearing,
and
how
could
he
learn
anything
about
it
unless
since
it
was
newly
discovered
evidence
he
would
give
us
the
opportunity
to
present
it.
mr.
louis
chandler
no,
i
don’t.
the
acts
provides
that
it
be
a
hearing
officer
or
staff
employee
but
it
also
provides
that
he
may
make
no
recommendations
and
that
the
regional
director
will
make
the
decision
but
the
important
aspect
of
this
is
that
it’s
really
investigatory
and
it
results
as
i
said
in
a
certification
and
it
contemplates
that
ultimately.
the
intent
of
congress
is
that
a
charge
will
be
filed
and
at
least
this
expedites
the
representation
area
of
the
proceedings
so
that
the
election
can
be
governed
over
with
and
if
there
were
issues
they
will
be
raise
in
the
complaint
case.
i
say
that
the
board
violated
the
act
by
adopting
the
regional
director’s
decision
and
applying
it
in
the
“c”
case
without
an
independent
--
mr.
louis
chandler
--
evaluation
of
facts.
mr.
louis
chandler
if
it’s
not
appeal
--
mr.
louis
chandler
if
there
has
been
an
independent
review
by
the
board.
mr.
louis
chandler
the
answer
is
i
would
expect
to
comply
with
the
board’s
determination
in
that
case
unless
they
were
newly
discovered
evidence.
mr.
louis
chandler
that
is
right
because
there
hasn’t
been
an
independent
review
that
applies
to
the
“c”
portion
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
chandler
only
for
representations
cases.
mr.
louis
chandler
but
not
when
it
comes
to
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
louis
chandler
but
they
would
have
it
examined
the
entire
record
and
that’s
my
point.
mr.
louis
chandler
but
they’ve
refuse
to
examine
the
record.
mr.
louis
chandler
only
for
that
purpose
of
representation
but
not
for
charge
cases
and
if
we
have
a
complaint
case
the
board
must
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
and
when
they
put
--
they
shifted
the
burden
in
the
motion
for
review
when
they
said
to
the
employer
and
they
say
to
any
party
filing
a
motion
for
review.
you
prove
to
us
by
compelling
reasons
that
the
regional
director
is
wrong.
they
shifted
the
burden
that
is
on
them
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
has
been
committed.
there’s
a
difference
in
the
burden
that
is
required
between
a
representation
issue
and
a
trial.
mr.
louis
chandler
and
50%
of
those
that
they
took
and
the
last
records
that
were
available
from
the
board,
they
reversed
the
regional
director.
mr.
louis
chandler
and
they
didn’t
take
case
and
they
didn’t
look
at
the
evidence
and
i
submit
sir,
that
the
section
10
of
the
act
requires
that
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
they
must
look
at
the
record
and
that
the
at
the
trial
examiner
is,
i
mean
the
regional
director
is
not
the
board
for
unfair
labor
practice
purposes;
for
representation
cases,
yes,
to
process
up
through
to
the
time
of
the
elections.
mr.
louis
chandler
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
short
time
remaining
until
three,
i
like
to
quote
from
judge
kaufman’s
statement
in
pepsi
cola
case
on
the
second
circuit
where
he
says,
that
the
board
procedure
for
review
under
102.67
which
is
exactly
what
we’re
talking
about
is
even
more
cursory
than
certiorari
since
the
petition
for
review
must
be
a
self-contained
document
cut
adrift
from
the
record.
in
certiorari,
the
record
is
certified
to
the
higher
court
for
examination
that
for
consideration
with
the
petition
and
the
shift
of
responsibility
is
improper
because
the
there’s
preponderance
of
evidence
required.
in
the
--
mr.
louis
chandler
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
louis
chandler
not
behind,
this
is
what
we
were
going
to
get
to,
the
--
mr.
louis
chandler
thank
you.
mr.
louis
chandler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
like
quote
judge
coffman
in
the
pepsi
cola
decision
as
to
the
requirements
the
court’s
consideration
of
the
record
and
the
board’s
findings
under
section
10.
he
states
in
an
unfair
practice
proceeding,
the
board
cannot
completely
advocate
its
responsibility
to
a
regional
director
a
functionary
whose
appointment
is
not
even
subject
to
consideration
by
the
senate
as
are
those
of
board
members.
moreover
the
board’s
experience
is
particularly
relevant
and
desirable
in
deciding
complex
issues
relating
to
the
appropriate
bargaining
unit
before
the
potent
sanctions
arising
from
the
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
are
invoked.
where
the
choices
between
two
fairly
conflicting
views,
the
court
must
defer
to
the
board’s
decision.
but
here,
the
board
has
not
actually
considered
the
questions
of
fact
in
law.
the
board
has
merely
rubber-stamped
his
decision
and
thus
the
regional
director’s
decision
was
perpetuated
even
though
it
may
have
been
in
fact
wrong
and
we
too
would
be
blindly
endorsing
the
question
about
result.
such
difference
to
the
regional
director
was
not
intended
by
congress,
it
decided
that
the
board
itself
must
grow
whether
a
litigant
has
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice,
we
see
no
basis
for
thus
mutilating
the
legislative
scheme.
and
judge
butzner
and
the
claimant
wife
said
in
a
case
that
also
involved
the
use
of
summary
judgment
that
the
use
of
summary
judgment
in
deciding
whether
an
employer
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
does
not
exempt
the
board
from
complying
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
the
board’s
earlier
consideration
of
the
company’s
request
for
review
of
the
regional
director’s
decision,
does
not
supply
the
deficiency.
for
them,
the
board
as
in
the
magnesium
case
simply
denied
the
request
–
that
was
my
interpolation
simply
denied
the
request
with
the
observation
that
it
raised
no
substantial
issues,
warrants
and
review.
the
board
is
charged
with
a
duty
of
stating
the
reasons
why
the
board
concluded
the
facts
that
showed
a
violation
of
law.
no
statutory
exception
to
this
rule
exist
because
critical
elements
of
the
controversy
were
determined
preliminarily
by
the
regional
director
and
the
representation
proceedings.
the
board,
not
the
regional
director
has
the
responsibility
of
deciding
complaints
--
mr.
louis
chandler
i
think
the
substantial
portion
of
it
would,
because
the
regional
director
based
his
decision
substantially
upon
the
evidence
testimony
given
by
the
witness
who
subsequently
stated,
admitted.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
think
the
fact
that
he
admitted
that
he
had
withheld
information
at
the
hearing
before
the
regional
director
would
be
that
kind
of
strong
evidence
sir.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
in
this
sense
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
review
must
under
section
10
(e)
as
it
reads
and
as
i
interpreted
include
a
review
of
the
board
findings
as
well
as
making
a
determination
based
upon
substantial
evidence
on
the
record.
and
the
board
findings
are
as
set
forth
as
required
in
section
10
(c)
requiring
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
be
used
by
the
board
in
making
its
determination
so
that
they
must
be
read
together
and
in
an
analysis
by
the
bureau
of
national
affairs
made
on
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
1946,
they
have
a
specific
reference
to
the
exceptions
to
the
apa
under
a
comment
in
section
5
which
talks
about
the
division
of
fall
as
between
the
functionaries
like
the
regional
director
and
board
members
even
on
the
exceptions
and
one
exception
if
you
recall
was
that
relating
to
the
certification
of
employee
representatives.
and
then
the
analysis
the
bna
says
with
respect
to
the
accepted
matters.
the
senate
judiciary
committee
emphasizes
that
administrative
agency
should
not
apply
the
exemption
to
such
cases
as
tend
to
be
accusatory
in
form
and
involved
sharply
controverted
factual
issues
since
the
prescribed
exceptions
are
not
to
be
interpreted
as
precluding
the
statutory
procedure
under
apa
where
it
is
required.
and
i
submit
sir
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
delays
inherent
in
the
board’s
refusal
independently
to
review
the
evidence
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
so
that
the
boards
would
feel
--
the
board
would
feel
--
the
parties
rather
would
feel
compelled
to
take
the
cases
to
a
circuit
court
to
secure
their
first
review
of
all
the
evidence
presented
at
the
regional
director
level
or
being
on
a
substantial
rather
than
the
preponderance
of
evidence
test
as
the
statute
provides.
mr.
louis
chandler
not
on
the
basis
that
the
law
provided
for,
congress
provided
that
a
preponderance
of
evidence
test
first
be
applied
by
the
board.
that’s
in
section
10
(c).
the
court
reviews
it
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence
and
then
not
reviewing
the
board’s
finding
so
that
the
parties
i
submit
are
being
deprived
of
their
rights
under
the
act.
and
also
of
course
under
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
judge
coffman
in
relying
--
mr.
louis
chandler
yes
i
do
that,
i
agree
that
they
were
reviewed.
mr.
louis
chandler
expressly
and
this
is
what
i
quarrel
with
because
when
judge
coffman
states
that
a
difficult
question
was
involved
and
that
he
was
relying
on
the
expertise
of
the
regional
director
which
is
set
forth
in
record
appendix
page
205
and
states
at
the
last
page
of
his
decision
that
perhaps
the
board
ruled
or
determined
in
its
own
mind
that
it
was
not
a
difficult
question.
i
don’t
believe
that
party
should
have
to
rely
on
the
judge’s
speculation
as
to
the
reason
for
the
board’s
action.
mr.
louis
chandler
on
page
205
of
the
record
appendix,
he
so
indicated
because
there
was
no
expertise
of
the
board
involved
based
upon
all
of
the
evidence
because
they
refused
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
that
pittsburgh
plate
glass
which
is
the
only
case
upon
which
the
board
relies
was
decided
1941
and
in
that
case
the
board
made
its
own
findings
on
the
representation
case
after
the
board
members
reviewed
the
evidence
and
it
was
decided
five
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1961,
the
board
attempted
by
the
means
of
the
reorganization
plan
number
five
to
get
permission
to
delegate
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
and
congress
rejected
this
proposal
and
the
board
should
not
now
be
permitted
to
accomplish
administratively
what
it
could
not
persuade
congress
to
do.
the
desire
to
expedite
does
not
give
the
board
the
right
to
legislate
from
the
sense
a
waiver
rights
of
the
parties
or
to
refuse
to
consider
pertinent
and
vital
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
board
so
called
rule
against
litigation
when
applied
in
this
manner
is
directly
contrary
to
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
and
a
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
would
like
to
call
this
honorable
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
electronic
alloys
in
183
nlrb
14,
which
was
also
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
that
arose
from
refusal
to
bargain
after
the
board
refused
to
review
the
regional
director’s
decision
on
an
appropriate
unit.
and
the
board
stated
in
that
unfair
labor
practice
case
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
respondent’s
response
to
the
notice
to
show
cause.
the
respondent
contends
that
the
board
has
never
independently
reviewed
the
record
to
determine
whether
the
regional
director
was
correct
in
concluding
that
the
unit
is
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
we
have
examined
the
decision
and
direction
of
election
in
that
case,
we
have
made
an
independent
review
of
the
record
in
that
case
and
hold
that
the
regional
director’s
findings
and
conclusions
are
correct.
there's
a
footnote
and
they
point
to
some
findings
that
they
disagree
with,
that
do
not
affect
the
correctness
of
its
ultimate
conclusion
that
there
is
an
appropriate
unit
and
say
accordingly
as
now
all
issues
have
been
fully
litigated
and
no
newly
discovered
or
previously
unavailable
evidence
is
offered,
no
further
hearing
is
required
and
we
shall
therefore
grant
the
general
counsel’s
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
board
thus
acknowledges
that
while
the
review
of
a
regional
director’s
decision
in
a
representation
case
maybe
discretionary.
independent
board
review
is
required,
should
the
representation
case
ripen
into
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
and
the
petitioner
here
is
entitled
for
no
less
if
the
law
was
to
be
administered
fairly
and
without
discrimination
and
the
petitioner
respectfully
urges
that
the
enforcement
decree
be
vacated.
thank
you
very
much.
