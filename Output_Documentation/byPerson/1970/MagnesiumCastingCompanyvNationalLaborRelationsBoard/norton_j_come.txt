mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
as
this
court
is
aware,
an
employer
who
contests
the
validity
of
a
representation
election
conducted
under
section
9
of
the
act
including
the
unit
determination
can
obtain
court
review
of
that
determination
only
through
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
under
section
10.
that
is
he
can
refuse
to
bargain
on
the
grounds
that
the
certification
is
invalid,
thereby
triggering
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
as
the
board
ultimately
finds
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
5,
an
issues
of
bargaining
order.
he
gets
review
of
the
bargaining
order
and
of
the
underlying
certification,
a
record
of
which
is
before
the
court
of
appeals
by
virtue
of
section
9
(d)
under
section
10
(e)
and
(f).
now,
since
early
wagner
act
days,
it
has
been
established
that
absent
newly
discovered
evidence
or
other
exceptional
circumstances,
the
employer
is
not
entitled
to
re-litigate
in
this
section
10
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
any
issues
which
were
or
could
have
been
litigated
and
determined
in
the
prior
related
representation
proceeding.
and
as
this
court
explained
in
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case
in
1941.
this
is
because
the
unit
proceeding
and
the
complaint
on
unfair
labor
practices
are
really
one
proceeding
and
thus
a
single
trial
of
the
representation
issue
was
enough.
now,
until
1959
the
issues
in
a
section
9
representation
proceeding
as
well
as
those
in
a
section
9
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
were
determined
by
the
board
itself.
now
in
that
year,
congress
amended
section
3
(b)
to
permit
the
board
to
delegate
to
it's
regional
directors
its
powers
namely
the
boards
powers
under
section
9
including
the
power
to
determine
the
unit
appropriate
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
provided
however
that
upon
the
request
of
an
interested
person
the
board,
this
is
congress's
words
may
review
any
action
of
a
regional
director
delegated
to
him.
now,
pursuant
to
this
authorization,
the
board
has
delegated
its
powers
to
determine
representation
issues
to
its
regional
directors.
the
procedures
in
brief
are
as
follows.
they’re
set
for
us
in
more
detail
in
our
brief.
when
a
petitioner's
file
and
with
the
regional
director
and
of
investigation
shows
that
it
appears
to
have
merit.
the
regional
directors
sit
down
for
hearing
before
a
hearing
officer
and
the
basis
of
the
record
developed
at
the
hearing
and
i
might
say
that
in
examination
of
the
appendix
here
shows
that
there
was
a
very
full
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer
with
plenty
of
opportunity
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
cross
examine
the
witnesses
including
scott
on
his
duties.
after
this
record
is
completed,
it
goes
to
regional
director
who
determines
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
the
unit
appropriate
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
and
directs
an
election
or
makes
other
disposition
of
the
matter.
the
boards
rules
further
provide
that
the
regional
director
shall
set
forth
his
findings,
conclusions
and
order
or
direction
which
he
has
gone
in
this
case
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
regional
director’s
decision
was
as
full
and
complete
as
any
that
it
had
ever
reviewed
were
the
board
itself
had
written
the
opinion
was
a
very
complete
decision
by
the
regional
director.
the
boards
rules
provide
that
the
decision
of
the
regional
director
shall
be
final
unless
a
request
for
review
is
filed
with
the
board.
then
the
rules
regarding
review
set
forth
a
number
of
grounds
upon
which
review
maybe
granted
by
the
board
or
the
regional
director
if
he
thinks
that
the
issue
is
an
important
one
that
should
be
decided
by
the
board
has
authority
to
transfer
it
forth
with
to
the
board.
now,
where
he
has
not
done
that
and
he
did
not
do
that
here,
a
party
after
the
director
has
decided
the
case
can
obtain
review,
if
he
persuades
the
board
that
his
case
falls
within
one
of
the
four
categories
that
are
set
forth
in
the
boards
rules,
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
law
presented
that
procedural
error
was
committed
that
there’s
been
a
departure
from
board
policy
or/and
that
what’s
involved
in
this
case
that
the
regional
director’s
decision
on
a
factual
issue
is
clearly
erroneous
on
the
record
in
such
error
prejudicially
affects
the
rights
of
a
party.
the
boards
rules
further
provide
that
any
request
for
review
must
be
a
self
contained
document
enabling
the
board
to
rule
on
the
basis
of
its
contents
and
that
would
respect
the
ground
to,
which
is
the
factual
error
ground
or
any
other
ground
were
appropriate
said
request
must
contain
a
summary
of
all
evidence
or
rulings
bearing
on
the
issues
together
with
page
citations
from
the
transcript
in
a
summary
of
argument.
and
petitioner
fully
availed
itself
of
its
right
under
this
rule
to
file
with
the
board
a
very
detailed
request
for
review
which
starts
at
page
117
on
the
record
and
that
goes
to
page
127
of
the
record,
setting
forth
in
very
specific
detail
the
respects
in
which
the
regional
director
erred.
what
record
references
as
to
evidence
that
he
allegedly
overlooked
with
regard
to
the
duties
of
scott
as
well
the
other
two
individuals
whose
status
was
in
question
and
also
a
very
detailed
legal
argument
as
to
the
applicable
legal
principles
and
controlling
board
decisions
that
the
regional
director
allegedly
overlooked.
the
board’s
rules
further
provide
that
an
opposition
maybe
filed
to
this
request
for
review
and
although
it’s
not
reprinted
in
the
record,
i
find
that
in
examining
the
original
record
that
the
petitioning
union
also
filed
a
document
with
the
board
in
opposition
to
the
request
for
review
which
again
contained
a
very
detailed
recital
of
the
record
evidence
supporting
the
regional
director’s
ruling.
the
board
had
these
two
documents
before
it
as
well
the
decision
of
the
regional
director
and
on
the
basis
of
that
decided
that
no
issue
warranting
review
was
provided
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
board
in
deciding
that
no
issue
was
presented
merely
rubberstamped
the
regional
director
you
had
as
focus
a
presentation
of
the
issues
as
you
could
possibly
have
had,
had
the
board
review
the
record
de
novo.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
but
i'm
just
saying
that
under
the
procedure
that
the
board
has
device
for
implementing
the
3
(b)
delegation,
there
is
a
very
real
opportunity
provided
to
a
party
requesting
review
to
text
the
board’s
eye,
if
there
is
any
glaring
error
on
the
part
of
the
regional
director.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
it
satisfies
one
of
the
criteria
for
granting.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
3
(b)
permits
the
board
to
delegate
the
authority
to
the
regional
director.
however,
3
(b)
says
that
any
party
--
subject
to
the
right
of
any
party
to
request
the
board
to
review
the
case
so
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
opportunity
to
request
the
board
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
does
not
but
i
just
want
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
was
a
de
novo
or
plenary
review.
however,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
this
petition
to
review
procedure
on
the
other
hand
is
a
meaningful.
it's
not
a
mere
rubber
stamping
of
the
regional
director
but
to
get
back
to
the
board’s
rules.
the
board's
rules
finally
provide
that
denial
of
a
request
for
review
shall
constitute
an
affirmance
of
the
regional
director’s
action
which
shall
also
preclude
re-litigating
any
such
issues
in
any
related
subsequent
on
the
fair
labor
of
practice
proceeding
and
so
that
the
issue
that
we
really
come
down
to
here
is
whether
or
not
this
procedure
is
valid
and
authorized
by
section
3
(b)
of
the
statute
or
put
more
specifically
whether
the
board
may
properly
apply
the
settled
principle
barring
re-litigation
and
the
subsequent
related
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
of
issues
determined
in
the
representation
proceeding
where
it
has
delegated
this
authority
to
the
regional
director
and
pursuant
to
the
3
(b)
delegation
and
has
declined
to
review
his
determination
or
whether
as
petitioners
contend
and
as
the
second
circuit
held
in
pepsi
cola,
the
board
is
required
before
facing
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding
on
this
representation
determination
of
the
directors
to
make
a
new
and
de
novo
full
review
of
the
record.
i
might
say
that
the
second
circuit
itself
seems
to
have
backed
down
substantially
from
pepsi
cola
in
two
decisions
subsequent
to
pepsi
cola
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
olson
bodies
and
bayliss
trucking.
apparently
they
are
now
holding
that
pepsi
cola
requirement
for
de
novo
review
applies
only
to
situations
where
you
have
as
they
put
it
a
difficult
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
so
the
substantial
amount
of
substance
has
been
taken
out
of
pepsi
cola
by
the
second
circuit
itself.
well,
our
position
is
basically
that
both
the
language
of
the
section
3
(b)
and
its
legislative
history
support
the
validity
of
the
board’s
delegation
procedure
on
its
face
3
(b)
as
i
have
just
outlined
to
the
court
indicates
a
congressional
purpose
to
endow
the
regional
director
with
all
the
powers
which
the
board
previously
had
in
a
section
9
proceeding.
subject
to
such
review
as
the
board
might
provide.
now,
since
the
board’s
powers
in
a
section
9
proceeding
previously
meant
that
the
board
--
that
you
are
not
entire
--
the
board
was
not
required
to
reexamine
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
issues
that
were
determined
in
our
case.
if
you
put
the
regional
director
in
the
shoes
of
the
board,
it
should
follow,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
board
redetermination
of
the
issue
determined
by
the
regional
director
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
absent,
newly
discovered
evidence.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don’t
now
whether
the
second
circuit
would
regard
the
type
of
issue
that
we
have
here
as
being
the
difficult
question
of
mixed
law
and
fact
that
would
require
the
board
to
review
the
record
de
novo.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
had
great
doubt
in
knowing
how
to
apply
that
standard.
what
you
had
in
pepsi
cola
was
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
certain
employees
were
independent
contractors
or
not.
the
question
that
you
have
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
a
question
quite
like
the
supervisor
question
and
therefore
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
the
second
circuit
would
regard
this
case
as
controlled
by
pepsi
cola
rather
than
bayliss
and
olson.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
my
opinion
that
we
probably
would
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
in
olson.
in
olson
you
had
a
different
panel.
judge
smith
was
the
only
one
in
common
to
the
--
who
sat
on
pepsi
cola.
you
act
judge
friendly
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
feinberg
--
judge
friendly
and
judge
feinberg
who
were
not
on
pepsi
cola
and
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
in
olson
speaking
for
himself
and
judge
feinberg
because
judge
smith
especially
incurred
on
that
point
indicated
that
he
had
great
misgivings
as
to
validity
of
pepsi
cola
but
then
he
went
on
to
find
pepsi
cola
distinguishable
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
there
was
not
as
the
important
or
as
difficult
as
the
one
in
pepsi
cola.
but
in
any
event,
our
position
is
that
neither
the
language
of
the
statute
nor
the
legislative
history
permits
or
warrants
the
kind
of
distinction
that
the
second
circuit
is
now
growing.
we
think
that
it
was
congress's
intention
to
permit
the
board,
to
delegate
final
authority
subject
to
this
limited
right
to
review
by
the
board.
of
all
representation
issues
particularly
those
involving
–
including
those
involving
determination
of
an
appropriate
unit,
whether
it
be
a
supervisory
question
or
an
independent
contractor
question
or
a
plain
clerical
question,
we
had
in
olson
bodies.
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
basic
congressional
objective
as
is
in
enacting
the
3(b)
delegation
as
is
succinctly
pointed
out
by
senator
goldwater
in
our
quotation
we
have
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
he
was
no
the
house
senate
conference
committee
was
to
expedite
final
disposition
of
cases
by
the
board,
by
turning
over
part
of
its
case
load
to
its
regional
directors
for
final
determination.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
they
have
empowered
the
regional
director
to
act
in
all
respects
as
the
board
itself
will
act.
now
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
if
there
are
exceptions
to
the
trial
examiner's
findings,
the
board
will
take
the
case
up
and
review
the
record
itself
with
respect
to
those
matters
that
are
accepted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
apply
the
predominance
of
the
evidence
standard
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
preponderance.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
did
not
even
regard
--
the
trial
examiner
made
no
findings
here
he
granted
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
granted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
since
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yeah,
but
the
board
does
not
rereview
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
does
not
review
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
but
it
would
not
have
applied
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
not
have
applied
before
its
3
(b).
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it's
more
than
substantial
evidence
as
to
the
difference
between
clearly
erroneous
and
preponderance
of
the
evidence
i
think
we
could
get
in
to
a
nice
philosophical
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
with
the
regard
to
credibility,
they
usually
will
not
disturb
a
trial
examiner’s
credibility
determination.
i
might
say
that
in
this
case
there
were
no
credibility
issues
because
the
only
important
issue
on
which
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
scott
had
power
to
discipline
an
employee.
the
regional
director
assumed
the
validity,
accepted
it
is
true,
the
companies
version
that
he
did
on
one
occasion
discipline
or
threaten
to
fire
this
man
but
found
that
that
even
assuming
that
that
were
true
that
one
incident
was
sporadic
enough
so
that
it
did
not
overcome
the
other
evidence
shelling
non
supervisory
authority.
now
i
just
want
to
in
closing
say
one
word
about
this
motion
to
a
newly
discovered
evidence.
now,
the
respondent
could
have
gotten
a
hearing
at
the
unfair
labor
practice
case,if
in
response
to
the
order
to
show
cause,
it
was
able
to
come
forward
with
evidence
that
was
in
fact
newly
discovered.
now,
obviously
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
had
they
come
forward
with
newly
discovered
evidence,
the
trial
examiner
would
have
held
a
hearing
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
was
newly
discovered
and
in
the
light
of
that
evidence
he
would
have
reconsidered
the
regional
director’s
determination
and
then
it
would
have
gone
up
to
the
board.
however,
what
happened
here
was
that
petitioner’s
request
or
claim
of
newly
discovered
evidence
was
a
bare
naked
allegation
that
scott
had
allegedly
withheld
information
as
to
his
full
supervisory
duties
with
no
indication
whatsoever
as
to
what
it
was
that
he
withheld
and
then
as
the
trial
examiner
found
and
as
petitioner’s
offer
of
proof
shows
which
is
in
the
record.
petitioner
when
it
listed
what
it
was
going
to
show
at
this
hearing
list
ticked
off
factors
as
to
scott’s
power
to
discipline
as
his
power
to
recommend
raises
and
so
on,
a
list
of
ten
items,
all
of
which
had
been
gone
in
to
very
thoroughly
in
the
representation
case
and
which
was
subject
to
cross
examination
by
petitioner.
so
the
trial
examiner
found
that
in
those
circumstances
the
claim
--
that
there
was
newly
discovered
evidence
here
was
merely
a
sham
in
that
effort
to
attempt
to
re-litigate
the
very
same
issues
that
had
been
gone
into
extensively
in
the
representation
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
that
finding.
so
we
submit
that
in
those
circumstances
there
are
certainly
no
substantial
issue
that
merits
attention
by
this
court
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
newly
discovered
evidence
that
would
have
warrant
a
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
not
your
honor,
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
the
conflict
has
been
muted
somewhat
by
the
second
circuit
subsequent
decisions
in
--
subsequent
to
pepsi
cola
but
i
think
on
the
type
of
issue
that
we
have
here,
we
still
have
that
conflict.
and
i
submit
that
the
view
of
the
first
circuit
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
tenth
circuit
is
the
correct
one
and
the
one
that
is
most
consonant
with
the
congress's
objective
in
enacting
the
amendment
to
3
(b)
because
the
practical
point
of
the
matter
is
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
yesterday.
if
you
are
going
to
require
the
board
when
a
representation
determination
ends
up
in
a
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
and
potentially
any
certification
case
can
do
that
because
that’s
the
only
way
the
employer
can
get
review.
to
review
the
record
fully
at
that
stage,
you
are
not
making
the
regional
director’s
determination
final
as
congress
intended
to
do
subject
to
merely
discretionary
review
by
the
board
and
you
are
robbing
the
–
r
case
delegation
of
the
time
saving
that
congress
intended
to
get
from
permitting
the
board
to
do
that
because
whatever
time
you
say
that
the
–
r
case
stage
is
going
to
be
dissipated
at
the
c
case
stage
and
we
have
statistics
in
our
brief
which
show
that
it's
rather
dramatic
that
under
the
r
case
delegation
and
when
the
regional
director
is
permitted
to
decide
these
things
himself,
the
time
from
filing
of
a
petition
to
direction
of
election
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
48
days
where
as
if
it
goes
to
the
board,
it’s
about
245
days.
and
he
would
just
be
substantially
sapping
the
r
case
delegation
of
the
value
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
and
if
it
is
not
necessary,
we
submit
to
protect
the
fundamental
rights
of
respondents
to
board
proceedings
as
is
amply
shown
by
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
thank
you
your
honor
mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
as
this
court
is
aware,
an
employer
who
contests
the
validity
of
a
representation
election
conducted
under
section
9
of
the
act
including
the
unit
determination
can
obtain
court
review
of
that
determination
only
through
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
under
section
10.
that
is
he
can
refuse
to
bargain
on
the
grounds
that
the
certification
is
invalid,
thereby
triggering
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
as
the
board
ultimately
finds
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
5,
an
issues
of
bargaining
order.
he
gets
review
of
the
bargaining
order
and
of
the
underlying
certification,
a
record
of
which
is
before
the
court
of
appeals
by
virtue
of
section
9
(d)
under
section
10
(e)
and
(f).
now,
since
early
wagner
act
days,
it
has
been
established
that
absent
newly
discovered
evidence
or
other
exceptional
circumstances,
the
employer
is
not
entitled
to
re-litigate
in
this
section
10
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
any
issues
which
were
or
could
have
been
litigated
and
determined
in
the
prior
related
representation
proceeding.
and
as
this
court
explained
in
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case
in
1941.
this
is
because
the
unit
proceeding
and
the
complaint
on
unfair
labor
practices
are
really
one
proceeding
and
thus
a
single
trial
of
the
representation
issue
was
enough.
now,
until
1959
the
issues
in
a
section
9
representation
proceeding
as
well
as
those
in
a
section
9
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
were
determined
by
the
board
itself.
now
in
that
year,
congress
amended
section
3
(b)
to
permit
the
board
to
delegate
to
it's
regional
directors
its
powers
namely
the
boards
powers
under
section
9
including
the
power
to
determine
the
unit
appropriate
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
provided
however
that
upon
the
request
of
an
interested
person
the
board,
this
is
congress's
words
may
review
any
action
of
a
regional
director
delegated
to
him.
now,
pursuant
to
this
authorization,
the
board
has
delegated
its
powers
to
determine
representation
issues
to
its
regional
directors.
the
procedures
in
brief
are
as
follows.
they’re
set
for
us
in
more
detail
in
our
brief.
when
a
petitioner's
file
and
with
the
regional
director
and
of
investigation
shows
that
it
appears
to
have
merit.
the
regional
directors
sit
down
for
hearing
before
a
hearing
officer
and
the
basis
of
the
record
developed
at
the
hearing
and
i
might
say
that
in
examination
of
the
appendix
here
shows
that
there
was
a
very
full
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer
with
plenty
of
opportunity
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
cross
examine
the
witnesses
including
scott
on
his
duties.
after
this
record
is
completed,
it
goes
to
regional
director
who
determines
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
the
unit
appropriate
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
and
directs
an
election
or
makes
other
disposition
of
the
matter.
the
boards
rules
further
provide
that
the
regional
director
shall
set
forth
his
findings,
conclusions
and
order
or
direction
which
he
has
gone
in
this
case
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
regional
director’s
decision
was
as
full
and
complete
as
any
that
it
had
ever
reviewed
were
the
board
itself
had
written
the
opinion
was
a
very
complete
decision
by
the
regional
director.
the
boards
rules
provide
that
the
decision
of
the
regional
director
shall
be
final
unless
a
request
for
review
is
filed
with
the
board.
then
the
rules
regarding
review
set
forth
a
number
of
grounds
upon
which
review
maybe
granted
by
the
board
or
the
regional
director
if
he
thinks
that
the
issue
is
an
important
one
that
should
be
decided
by
the
board
has
authority
to
transfer
it
forth
with
to
the
board.
now,
where
he
has
not
done
that
and
he
did
not
do
that
here,
a
party
after
the
director
has
decided
the
case
can
obtain
review,
if
he
persuades
the
board
that
his
case
falls
within
one
of
the
four
categories
that
are
set
forth
in
the
boards
rules,
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
law
presented
that
procedural
error
was
committed
that
there’s
been
a
departure
from
board
policy
or/and
that
what’s
involved
in
this
case
that
the
regional
director’s
decision
on
a
factual
issue
is
clearly
erroneous
on
the
record
in
such
error
prejudicially
affects
the
rights
of
a
party.
the
boards
rules
further
provide
that
any
request
for
review
must
be
a
self
contained
document
enabling
the
board
to
rule
on
the
basis
of
its
contents
and
that
would
respect
the
ground
to,
which
is
the
factual
error
ground
or
any
other
ground
were
appropriate
said
request
must
contain
a
summary
of
all
evidence
or
rulings
bearing
on
the
issues
together
with
page
citations
from
the
transcript
in
a
summary
of
argument.
and
petitioner
fully
availed
itself
of
its
right
under
this
rule
to
file
with
the
board
a
very
detailed
request
for
review
which
starts
at
page
117
on
the
record
and
that
goes
to
page
127
of
the
record,
setting
forth
in
very
specific
detail
the
respects
in
which
the
regional
director
erred.
what
record
references
as
to
evidence
that
he
allegedly
overlooked
with
regard
to
the
duties
of
scott
as
well
the
other
two
individuals
whose
status
was
in
question
and
also
a
very
detailed
legal
argument
as
to
the
applicable
legal
principles
and
controlling
board
decisions
that
the
regional
director
allegedly
overlooked.
the
board’s
rules
further
provide
that
an
opposition
maybe
filed
to
this
request
for
review
and
although
it’s
not
reprinted
in
the
record,
i
find
that
in
examining
the
original
record
that
the
petitioning
union
also
filed
a
document
with
the
board
in
opposition
to
the
request
for
review
which
again
contained
a
very
detailed
recital
of
the
record
evidence
supporting
the
regional
director’s
ruling.
the
board
had
these
two
documents
before
it
as
well
the
decision
of
the
regional
director
and
on
the
basis
of
that
decided
that
no
issue
warranting
review
was
provided
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
board
in
deciding
that
no
issue
was
presented
merely
rubberstamped
the
regional
director
you
had
as
focus
a
presentation
of
the
issues
as
you
could
possibly
have
had,
had
the
board
review
the
record
de
novo.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
but
i'm
just
saying
that
under
the
procedure
that
the
board
has
device
for
implementing
the
3
(b)
delegation,
there
is
a
very
real
opportunity
provided
to
a
party
requesting
review
to
text
the
board’s
eye,
if
there
is
any
glaring
error
on
the
part
of
the
regional
director.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
it
satisfies
one
of
the
criteria
for
granting.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
3
(b)
permits
the
board
to
delegate
the
authority
to
the
regional
director.
however,
3
(b)
says
that
any
party
--
subject
to
the
right
of
any
party
to
request
the
board
to
review
the
case
so
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
an
opportunity
to
request
the
board
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
does
not
but
i
just
want
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
was
a
de
novo
or
plenary
review.
however,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
this
petition
to
review
procedure
on
the
other
hand
is
a
meaningful.
it's
not
a
mere
rubber
stamping
of
the
regional
director
but
to
get
back
to
the
board’s
rules.
the
board's
rules
finally
provide
that
denial
of
a
request
for
review
shall
constitute
an
affirmance
of
the
regional
director’s
action
which
shall
also
preclude
re-litigating
any
such
issues
in
any
related
subsequent
on
the
fair
labor
of
practice
proceeding
and
so
that
the
issue
that
we
really
come
down
to
here
is
whether
or
not
this
procedure
is
valid
and
authorized
by
section
3
(b)
of
the
statute
or
put
more
specifically
whether
the
board
may
properly
apply
the
settled
principle
barring
re-litigation
and
the
subsequent
related
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
of
issues
determined
in
the
representation
proceeding
where
it
has
delegated
this
authority
to
the
regional
director
and
pursuant
to
the
3
(b)
delegation
and
has
declined
to
review
his
determination
or
whether
as
petitioners
contend
and
as
the
second
circuit
held
in
pepsi
cola,
the
board
is
required
before
facing
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding
on
this
representation
determination
of
the
directors
to
make
a
new
and
de
novo
full
review
of
the
record.
i
might
say
that
the
second
circuit
itself
seems
to
have
backed
down
substantially
from
pepsi
cola
in
two
decisions
subsequent
to
pepsi
cola
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
olson
bodies
and
bayliss
trucking.
apparently
they
are
now
holding
that
pepsi
cola
requirement
for
de
novo
review
applies
only
to
situations
where
you
have
as
they
put
it
a
difficult
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
so
the
substantial
amount
of
substance
has
been
taken
out
of
pepsi
cola
by
the
second
circuit
itself.
well,
our
position
is
basically
that
both
the
language
of
the
section
3
(b)
and
its
legislative
history
support
the
validity
of
the
board’s
delegation
procedure
on
its
face
3
(b)
as
i
have
just
outlined
to
the
court
indicates
a
congressional
purpose
to
endow
the
regional
director
with
all
the
powers
which
the
board
previously
had
in
a
section
9
proceeding.
subject
to
such
review
as
the
board
might
provide.
now,
since
the
board’s
powers
in
a
section
9
proceeding
previously
meant
that
the
board
--
that
you
are
not
entire
--
the
board
was
not
required
to
reexamine
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
issues
that
were
determined
in
our
case.
if
you
put
the
regional
director
in
the
shoes
of
the
board,
it
should
follow,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
board
redetermination
of
the
issue
determined
by
the
regional
director
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
absent,
newly
discovered
evidence.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don’t
now
whether
the
second
circuit
would
regard
the
type
of
issue
that
we
have
here
as
being
the
difficult
question
of
mixed
law
and
fact
that
would
require
the
board
to
review
the
record
de
novo.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
had
great
doubt
in
knowing
how
to
apply
that
standard.
what
you
had
in
pepsi
cola
was
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
certain
employees
were
independent
contractors
or
not.
the
question
that
you
have
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
a
question
quite
like
the
supervisor
question
and
therefore
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
the
second
circuit
would
regard
this
case
as
controlled
by
pepsi
cola
rather
than
bayliss
and
olson.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
my
opinion
that
we
probably
would
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
in
olson.
in
olson
you
had
a
different
panel.
judge
smith
was
the
only
one
in
common
to
the
--
who
sat
on
pepsi
cola.
you
act
judge
friendly
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
feinberg
--
judge
friendly
and
judge
feinberg
who
were
not
on
pepsi
cola
and
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
in
olson
speaking
for
himself
and
judge
feinberg
because
judge
smith
especially
incurred
on
that
point
indicated
that
he
had
great
misgivings
as
to
validity
of
pepsi
cola
but
then
he
went
on
to
find
pepsi
cola
distinguishable
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
there
was
not
as
the
important
or
as
difficult
as
the
one
in
pepsi
cola.
but
in
any
event,
our
position
is
that
neither
the
language
of
the
statute
nor
the
legislative
history
permits
or
warrants
the
kind
of
distinction
that
the
second
circuit
is
now
growing.
we
think
that
it
was
congress's
intention
to
permit
the
board,
to
delegate
final
authority
subject
to
this
limited
right
to
review
by
the
board.
of
all
representation
issues
particularly
those
involving
–
including
those
involving
determination
of
an
appropriate
unit,
whether
it
be
a
supervisory
question
or
an
independent
contractor
question
or
a
plain
clerical
question,
we
had
in
olson
bodies.
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
basic
congressional
objective
as
is
in
enacting
the
3(b)
delegation
as
is
succinctly
pointed
out
by
senator
goldwater
in
our
quotation
we
have
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
he
was
no
the
house
senate
conference
committee
was
to
expedite
final
disposition
of
cases
by
the
board,
by
turning
over
part
of
its
case
load
to
its
regional
directors
for
final
determination.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
they
have
empowered
the
regional
director
to
act
in
all
respects
as
the
board
itself
will
act.
now
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
if
there
are
exceptions
to
the
trial
examiner's
findings,
the
board
will
take
the
case
up
and
review
the
record
itself
with
respect
to
those
matters
that
are
accepted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
apply
the
predominance
of
the
evidence
standard
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
preponderance.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
did
not
even
regard
--
the
trial
examiner
made
no
findings
here
he
granted
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
granted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
since
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yeah,
but
the
board
does
not
rereview
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
does
not
review
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
but
it
would
not
have
applied
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
not
have
applied
before
its
3
(b).
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it's
more
than
substantial
evidence
as
to
the
difference
between
clearly
erroneous
and
preponderance
of
the
evidence
i
think
we
could
get
in
to
a
nice
philosophical
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
with
the
regard
to
credibility,
they
usually
will
not
disturb
a
trial
examiner’s
credibility
determination.
i
might
say
that
in
this
case
there
were
no
credibility
issues
because
the
only
important
issue
on
which
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
scott
had
power
to
discipline
an
employee.
the
regional
director
assumed
the
validity,
accepted
it
is
true,
the
companies
version
that
he
did
on
one
occasion
discipline
or
threaten
to
fire
this
man
but
found
that
that
even
assuming
that
that
were
true
that
one
incident
was
sporadic
enough
so
that
it
did
not
overcome
the
other
evidence
shelling
non
supervisory
authority.
now
i
just
want
to
in
closing
say
one
word
about
this
motion
to
a
newly
discovered
evidence.
now,
the
respondent
could
have
gotten
a
hearing
at
the
unfair
labor
practice
case,if
in
response
to
the
order
to
show
cause,
it
was
able
to
come
forward
with
evidence
that
was
in
fact
newly
discovered.
now,
obviously
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
had
they
come
forward
with
newly
discovered
evidence,
the
trial
examiner
would
have
held
a
hearing
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
was
newly
discovered
and
in
the
light
of
that
evidence
he
would
have
reconsidered
the
regional
director’s
determination
and
then
it
would
have
gone
up
to
the
board.
however,
what
happened
here
was
that
petitioner’s
request
or
claim
of
newly
discovered
evidence
was
a
bare
naked
allegation
that
scott
had
allegedly
withheld
information
as
to
his
full
supervisory
duties
with
no
indication
whatsoever
as
to
what
it
was
that
he
withheld
and
then
as
the
trial
examiner
found
and
as
petitioner’s
offer
of
proof
shows
which
is
in
the
record.
petitioner
when
it
listed
what
it
was
going
to
show
at
this
hearing
list
ticked
off
factors
as
to
scott’s
power
to
discipline
as
his
power
to
recommend
raises
and
so
on,
a
list
of
ten
items,
all
of
which
had
been
gone
in
to
very
thoroughly
in
the
representation
case
and
which
was
subject
to
cross
examination
by
petitioner.
so
the
trial
examiner
found
that
in
those
circumstances
the
claim
--
that
there
was
newly
discovered
evidence
here
was
merely
a
sham
in
that
effort
to
attempt
to
re-litigate
the
very
same
issues
that
had
been
gone
into
extensively
in
the
representation
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
that
finding.
so
we
submit
that
in
those
circumstances
there
are
certainly
no
substantial
issue
that
merits
attention
by
this
court
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
newly
discovered
evidence
that
would
have
warrant
a
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
not
your
honor,
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
the
conflict
has
been
muted
somewhat
by
the
second
circuit
subsequent
decisions
in
--
subsequent
to
pepsi
cola
but
i
think
on
the
type
of
issue
that
we
have
here,
we
still
have
that
conflict.
and
i
submit
that
the
view
of
the
first
circuit
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
tenth
circuit
is
the
correct
one
and
the
one
that
is
most
consonant
with
the
congress's
objective
in
enacting
the
amendment
to
3
(b)
because
the
practical
point
of
the
matter
is
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
yesterday.
if
you
are
going
to
require
the
board
when
a
representation
determination
ends
up
in
a
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
and
potentially
any
certification
case
can
do
that
because
that’s
the
only
way
the
employer
can
get
review.
to
review
the
record
fully
at
that
stage,
you
are
not
making
the
regional
director’s
determination
final
as
congress
intended
to
do
subject
to
merely
discretionary
review
by
the
board
and
you
are
robbing
the
–
r
case
delegation
of
the
time
saving
that
congress
intended
to
get
from
permitting
the
board
to
do
that
because
whatever
time
you
say
that
the
–
r
case
stage
is
going
to
be
dissipated
at
the
c
case
stage
and
we
have
statistics
in
our
brief
which
show
that
it's
rather
dramatic
that
under
the
r
case
delegation
and
when
the
regional
director
is
permitted
to
decide
these
things
himself,
the
time
from
filing
of
a
petition
to
direction
of
election
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
48
days
where
as
if
it
goes
to
the
board,
it’s
about
245
days.
and
he
would
just
be
substantially
sapping
the
r
case
delegation
of
the
value
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
and
if
it
is
not
necessary,
we
submit
to
protect
the
fundamental
rights
of
respondents
to
board
proceedings
as
is
amply
shown
by
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
thank
you
your
honor
