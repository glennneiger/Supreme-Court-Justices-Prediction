mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

is
the
solicitor

office
still
of
the
view
that
this

and
not
here?

very
well,
we'll

mr.

he
could
have
a
lawyer
there?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
springer,
is
this
any
more
really
than
a
limitation
to
keep
this
from
becoming
an
adversary
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
essentially
what
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
use
the
term
“lawyer”
at
all.
it
says
“attorney.”
that
means,
agent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
legal
counsel
is
a
separate
category.
he
can't
be
functioning
as
a
legal
counsel
in
this
hearing,
but
he
can
have
all
the
friends
there
he
wants
within
limits.
chief

e.
burger
that
was
by
administrative
directive,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
enter
in
any
way
in
the
jurisdictional
problem?
do
we
consider
the
consequences
of
a
jurisdictional
decision
when
we
make
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
karpatkin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
the
motion
on
jurisdiction
made
by
the
government
earlier
than
january
of
1970,
i
thought
it
was
made
last
fall?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wasn't
there
an
earlier
motion
with
the
same
effect
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
springer
is
indicating
in
the
negative.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
answers
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
silence
sometimes
is
the
source
of
the
ambiguity,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
isn't
there
and
that'd
be
the
negation
of
the
adversary
process
to
treat
as
a
party
someone
who
isn't
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
justice
brandeis
was
talking
about
the
tripod
situation
where
you
had
two
contending
parties
and
a
trier.
here,
you
do
not
have
or
i
think
justice
marshall
is
concerned
about
the
same
thing,
where
are
the
two
contending
parties
and
the
trier,
the
three
legs
on
the
stool?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
congress,
in
both
houses
filled
with
great
many
lawyers,
mr.
karpatkin,
certainly
when
they
drafted
this,
didn't
see
it
as
an
adversary
proceeding
in
that
sense,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
matter
justice
stewart
was
pursuing?
do
i
understand
you
to
concede
that
the
--
administratively,
the
regulations
could
be
amendment
so
as
to
eliminate
any
personal
appearance
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
got
a
hint
of
it,
that
was
all,
and
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it's
the
creature
--
if
the
regulation
is
a
creature
of
administrative
action,
things
so
rot
may
be
unrot
so,
may
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
all,
just
the
one
about
personal
appearance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
of
necessity,
you're
suggesting
that
when
the
administrative
regulations
were
promulgated
the
purpose
was
to
give
effect
to
a
constitutional
right
to
be
heard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
sometime
in
between
1940
and
now,
the
constitution
has
intruded
itself
with
the
aid
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
don't
you
give
us
the
essence
of
it
in
view
of
the
hour
and
then
put
it
in
and
file
it
with
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
karpatkin.
mr.

your
time
is
exhausted.
if
you
have
something
of
extreme
urgency,
we'll
