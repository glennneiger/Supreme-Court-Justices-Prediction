that
was
just
a
little
sideline
between

justice

as
a
practical
matter,
what's
been
going
on
out
in
the
northern
district
of
california
since
the
date
of
the
district
court's
decision?
has
anybody
been
inducted?
justice

what
is
that,
the
one
decision
subsequent
to
judge
peckham's
decision?
justice

thank
you.
justice

the
motion
filed
here
by
the
government
to
re
--
to
send
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
evans
case,
did
it
not?
as
i
look
at
the
chronology,
i
think
the
motion
was
filed
here
on
january
16
of
this
year
and
the
evans
decision
was
in
april
of
this

this
personal
appearance,
this
right
of
personal
appearance,
is
a
creature
of
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
too
is
a
creature
of
the
selective
service
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
no
doubt
secular
reasoning,
and
i'm
sure
that's
the
answer
to
what
my
question
is
going
to
suggest.
if
the
selective
service,
in
creating
this
right
by
a
statute,
had
considered
it
anything
like
the
adversary
hearing
that
you're
trying
your
--
in
your
submission
you're
saying
that
it
is,
it
would
follow
of
course
that
it
couldn't
possibly
have
promulgated
the
regulation
at
issue,
could
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
answer
is
that's
secular
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
letter
to
you?
justice

i
see.
