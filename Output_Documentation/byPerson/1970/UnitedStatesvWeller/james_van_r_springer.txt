mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
on
the
merits
of
this
case
is
the
validity
of
the
selective
service
regulation
that
says
that
a
registrant
may
not
be
represented
by
a
lawyer
when
he
has
his
personal
appearance
before
his
local
draft
board.
the
appellee,
weller,
was
classified
i-a
after
such
a
personal
appearance
or
rather
his
i-a
classification
was
retained,
going
to
the
procedures
after
a
bit,
after
such
a
personal
appearance,
but
he
refused
to
submit
to
induction
when
he
was
ordered
to
report
by
the
board
and,
accordingly,
he
was
indicted.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
before
trial
based
on
a
motion
filed,
actually
before
there
was
a
plea
to
the
indictment,
on
the
ground
that
weller's
lack
of
counsel
at
the
personal
appearance
invalidated
the
order
to
report
and,
the
united
states
has
appealed
from
that
order,
dismissing
the
indictment.
but
before
the
court
might
reach
the
merits,
there
is
a
threshold
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
government
can
appeal
this
dismissal
order
of
the
district
court
to
some
court.
the
question
is,
and
it's
a
difficult
one
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
whether
the
appeal
should
be
to
this
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
initially.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
understand,
i
don't
have
a
report
as
to
what
has
happened
this
morning.
the
report
i
had
yesterday
afternoon
is
that
a
bill,
in
which
the
senate
has
adopted
in
substance
the
government's
proposal
to
clear
up
this
area,
is
now
before
a
conference
committee.
the
house
has
not
passed
it.
it's
a
matter
of
getting
it
through
the
conference
committee
and
then
having
it
passed
by
the
house.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
may,
mr.
justice.
i'm
told
that
it
is
unlikely
however
that
it
would
be
intended
to
be
retroactive
to
cases
pending
on
appeal.
that
may
be
an
issue
that
will
come
back
to--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
can
hope
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
very
much
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
of
course
i
will
get
into
that,
although,
of
course,
we
initially
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
on
further
reflection.
the
solicitor
general
concluded
that
the
case
was
one
that
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
would
not
be
necessary,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
of
the
provision
in
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
says
if
an
appeal
is
improperly
brought
here
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
should
be
“remanded”
is
the
word,
but
if
you
--
of
course
we
filed,
in
lieu
of
a
jurisdictional
statement,
we
filed
something
called
a
motion
to
remand,
and
the
court
has
deferred
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
until
this
time.
so,
i
would
like
to
speak
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
outset
about
the
jurisdictional
question.
as
i
indicated,
this
case
comes
up
on
the
grant
of
the
motion
--
of
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
under
rule
12
of
the
criminal
rules
of
procedure.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
originally
based
on
two
grounds.
first,
a
claim
that
weller's
i-a
classification
was
improper
because
there
was
no
basis
in
fact
for
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim
and
second,
the
motion
asserted
the
claim
which
is
what
is
before
the
--
more
specifically,
before
the
court
now
that
the
order
of
the
court
was
invalid
because
weller
was,
in
several
respects
denied
due
process
at
his
personal
appearance
before
the
board,
principally
in
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
be
represent
by
counsel,
and
that
was
the
only
issue
that
has
survived
as
a
live
issue
to
this
point,
but
he
also
contended
initially
in
his
motion
that
the
local
board
had
improperly
denied
his
request
to
have
witnesses
with
him
and
to
have
a
court
reporter
transcribe
the
proceedings
of
the
personal
appearance.
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
and
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
itself
and
weller's
selective
service
file
which,
of
course,
was
undisputed
as
to
its
contents
which
had
been
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
he
filed.
the
file
--
the
selective
service
file
showed
on
its
face
that,
while
his
lawyer
had
written
letters
to
the
draft
board
asking
that
he
be
allowed
to
appear
with
weller
and
for
the
other
procedures
that
i've
mentioned
and
that
the
local
board
had
denied
them
in
reliance
on
the
regulations.
the
district
court
concluded
in
a
written
opinion
that
the
selective
service
regulation
in
question
here,
the
one
that
provides
that
no
registrant
may
be
represented
before
the
local
board
by
anyone
acting
as
attorney
or
legal
counsel
was
an
invalid
regulation.
it
did
not
directly
hold
that
the
regulation
was
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause.
instead,
it
followed
the
route
that
this
court
followed
in
the
greene
and
mcelroy
case,
some-11
years
ago,
relating
to
rights
of
confrontation
in
defense
department
security
clearance
proceedings.
the
district
court
considered
that
the
denial
of
counsel
before
the
local
draft
board
on
the
personal
appearance,
was
a
matter
of
doubtful
constitutionality,
and
therefore,
it
considered
that
the
regulation
could
not
be
valid
unless
there
was
express
congressional
authority
for
its
promulgation
by
the
president.
and,
the
district
court
found,
despite
the
circumstances
that
i
will
discuss
when
i
reach
the
merits
as
i
will,
the
district
court
decided
that
the
general
statutory
grant
of
authority
for
the
president
to
establish
selective
service
procedures
did
not
clearly
enough
authorize
him
to
promulgate
a
regulation
that
excluded
representation
by
counsel.
as
i
indicated,
it's
plain
that
this
dismissal
order
is
appealable
somewhere
since
it
came
before
the
trial
and
was
done
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
basis
of
a
procedural
defect
that
was
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
selective
service
record.
so,
the
only
question
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
whether
the
judgment
was
one
“based
on
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
or
information
is
founded”
or
in
the
alternative,
whether
it
was
a
“decision
or
judgment
sustaining
a
motion
at
bar.”
if
it
was
either
of
those,
then
the
appeal
would
be
directly
to
this
court.
we
say,
however,
that
it
was
neither
so
that
the
appeal
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
under
that
part
of
the
statute
which
gives
the
courts
of
appeals
jurisdiction
over
“any
decision
or
judgment
dismissing
any
indictment,
except
where
a
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
is
provided
by
this
section.”
of
course,
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
it
would
be
here,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
only
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
our
concern
is
more
--
rather,
than
a
narrow
concern
with
this
particular
litigation
is
with
the
administration
of
justice,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say.
assuming
that
we
do
not
have
a
new
legislation,
there
are
serious
questions
which
are,
if
nothing
else,
very
difficult
ones
for
the
government
in
deciding
where
to
proceed,
and
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
make
the
point
here
and
also,
we
believe
strongly
in
the
general
principles
of
this
underlying
much
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
that
cases
should
be
considered
in
the
courts
of
appeals
before
they
come
here.
and,
i
think
that
general
consideration
is
reflected
in
the
principle
that
underlies
the
majority
view
in
the
sisson
case
last
term,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
--
of
this
court's
cases
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
that
that
act
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
right,
mr.--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
as
i
will
try,
i
hope
briefly
to
articulate
our
reasons.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
it's
clear.
there's
no
question
of
jeopardy
here.
this
motion
was
filed
even
before
a
plea
was
made.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
having
brought
it
here,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
by
the
filing
of
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
district
court
called
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
of
course,
we
raised
this
at
the
first
stage
at
which
we
filed
any
papers
in
this
court.
we
had
a
dilemma,
frankly
as
we
frequently
have
under
this
act,
in
knowing
where
to
go
first.
i
think
the
principle
--
the
basic
principle
in
which
this
question
ought
to
be
considered
is
the
principle,
as
i
indicated,
as
the
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
a
technical
statute
that
historically
arose
from
a
clear
congressional
compromise
rather
than
from
a
single
coherent
all-embracing
legislative
purpose
and,
therefore,
that
it
should
be
read
narrowly.
and,
i
think
that
principle
is
especially
apt
in
this
situation
where
the
issue
is
not
whether
there
is
an
appeal
or
not,
but
simply
where
it
should
be.
so,
in
a
sense,
the
practical
issue
is
an
issue
of
the
management
of
appellate
business
rather
than
deciding
whether
or
not
a
litigant,
that
is
the
government,
has
a
right
to
appeal
or
not.
so,
in
that
sense,
i
think
the
--
it
might
be
said
that
less
is
at
stake
than,
for
example,
in
the
sisson
case
where
it
was
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
appeal
at
all.
in
light
of
that,
we
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
burden
of
argumentative
persuasion
should
be
on
those
who
say
that
the
appeal
should
come
directly
to
this
court,
short-circuiting
the
more
conventional
initial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
this
respect,
it
is
somewhat
like
the
principles
that
have
under
--
that
underlie
some
of
the
court's
decisions
in
the
three-judge
court
area
in
civil
cases
where
there's
a
similar
principle
of
narrow
reading
of
a
technical
statute.
let
me
then
turn
to
the
two
statutory
issues.
first,
the
question
whether
the
dismissal
of
weller's
indictment
on
the
ground
that
a
procedural
regulation
followed
by
the
local
draft
board
was
insufficiently
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
appellee
says
that
that
is
--
that
decision
amounted
to
a
construction
of
the
statute
on
which
the
indictment
is
based,
that
is,
the
selective
service
act.
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
the
dismissal
was
based
on
the
regulation,
not
on
the
act,
and
the
court
held
the
regulation
to
be
invalid
under
a
principle
of,
i
guess
you'd
call
it,
general
law
that
regulations
impairing
procedural
rights
are
invalid
unless
congress
has
specifically
authorized
them.
the
only
reference
to
the
statute,
therefore,
was
a
negative
one
and
we
do
not
think
that
a
determination
that
an
act
does
not
say
something
on
a
subject
has
to
be
treated
as
a
“construction”
of
the
statute
under
this
technical
act
which,
as
we
say,
should
be
read
narrowly.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
does
not.
it's
a
regulation
under
a
general
authorization
issue.
so,
in
that
respect,
it
is
different
from
the
mersky
case,
i
think,
where
the
regulation
was,
first,
a
substantive
regulation
and,
second
one,
directly
contemplated
by
the
statute
to
fill
out
a
gap
left
by
mistake.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
was
filed
before
sisson.
the
decision
was
filed
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
clearly
it
was
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
it
was
early
this
year.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
clearly
a
matter
of
cannot,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
pardon?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
was
born
in
1944,
so
he
would
now
be
26.
of
course,
he
is
under
--
the
issue
is
the
criminal
indictment
for
a
failure
to
report.
he
was
due
to
report
in
i
believe,
the
summer
of
1968
and
the
criminal
proceedings
have
been
pending
since,
shortly
after
that
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
not
sure
exactly
when
his
birthday
is,
mr.
justice
black,
nor
can
i
speak
authoritatively
as
to
the
effect
that
all
of
this
may
have
on
his
future.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
–
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
it
could
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
of
course,
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
that
once
the
case
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
we
say
it
should
be,
then
it
would
be
open
to
a
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
certiorari
before
judgment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though
i
think
that's
not
available
now
because
the
case
is
not
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
so
we
do
think
that
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
situation
from
the
mersky
situation
where
the
court
could
say
and
–
that
--
or
did
say,
again
over
the
government's
contrary
argument,
that
the
regulations
were
so
closely
intertwined
with
the
statute
that
the
issue
of
interpretation
of
the
regulation
should
be
considered
as
an
issue
of
interpretation
of
the
statute.
this
brings
me
to
the
motion
at
bar
point,
which
the
appellee
urges
alternatively
as
a
basis
for
this
court's
jurisdiction.
i
think
sisson,
again,
makes
it
clear
that
the
question
of
what
a
motion
at
bar
is,
is
a
question
that
is
still
open,
but
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
definition
suggested
by
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
the
mersky
case
which
would
limit
a
motion
at
bar
to
matters
in
confession
and
avoidance,
such
as
res
judicata
or
the
statute
of
limitations
or
denial
of
speedy
trial.
that
is
limited
to
defenses
that
do
not
go
to
the
general
issue,
but
which
solely
on
the
basis
of
new
matter
would
prevent
a
conviction
even
if
the
defendant
committed
the
criminal
acts
that
are
charged.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
except,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
this
is
not
new
matter.
i
think
it
has
to
be
said
that
implicit
in
the
indictment
is
an
allegation
that
the
process
of
classification,
that
is,
the
order
to
report
for
induction
was
a
valid
and
proper
order.
i
notice
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
couple
of
words
more
about
jurisdiction
and
then
move
on
to
the
merits
if
i
can.
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
point
about
the
applicability
of
a
motion
at
bar
when
we
paused
at
the
lunch
hour.
as
i
indicated,
we
think
that
that
clause
should
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
the
common
law
concept
of
a
special
plain
bar
and
there
are
indications
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
is
in
fact,
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1970
when
it
passed
the
act.
that
is,
the
principle
is
that
a
motion
at
bar
relates
only
to
a
defense
that
does
not
go
to
the
general
issue
and
which,
on
the
basis
of
new
matter,
would
prevent
a
conviction
even
if
the
defendant
committed
the
acts
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not,
because
mersky
has
held
nothing
about
the
motion
at
bar.
the
mersky--
in
mersky,
the
court
found
--
the
majority
found
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
by
–
size
--
side
play,
your
honor.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
--
that
unfortunately
is
necessary,
finally,
i
think
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
just
had
another
indication
at
lunch
time.
it
is
in
the,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
it
is
in
the
house
of
senate
conference
committee
on
the
law
enforcement
assistance.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
it's,
as
i
understand,
the
law
enforcement
assistance
bill.
it
has
been
passed
by
the
senate
with
the
criminal
appeals
act
amendment
in
it.
the
house
has
not,
that's
a
writer
and
--
well,
the
house
has
apparently
passed
the
basic
bill.
the
house
has
not
passed,
specifically,
the
amendment.
so,
it's
a
matter
of
working
it
out
in
the
conference
and
getting
it
done.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
would
--
well,
i
think
it
would
because
i
understand
the
bill
would
quite
clearly
resolve
this
problem.
in
fact,
there
--
i
have
had
some
indications
the
bill
may
eventually
come
out
with
a
provision
only
for
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
reserving
this
court
before
certiorari.
in
any
event,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
bill,
if
it's
accepted
in
anything
like
the
form
in
which
it
has
been
so
far,
would
not
allow
direct
appeal
in
any
case
that
does
not
involve
the
validity
of
the
underlying
statute,
so
that
we
wouldn't
have
this
construction
of
statute
issue
or
the
motion
at
bar
issue
i
think,
clearly,
as
i
understand
the
bill.
the
point,
i
think,
on
this
notion
of
a
motion
at
bar
as
something
raising
new
matter
that
would
prevent
a
conviction
even
if
the
defendant
has
committed
the
acts
of
which
he's
charged
is
that
the
defense
that
weller
has
raised
here
is
not
that
kind
of
defense.
his
defense
raised
in
his
motion
is
that
there
was
no
offense.
he's
not
confessing
the
events
and
saying
there's
some
external
reason
why
i
can't
be
convicted
for
it.
he
says
there
is
no
offense
because
implicit
in
the
indictment
is
an
allegation
that
the
order
to
report
for
induction
was
invalid.
he
claims
that
this
order
--
excuse
me,
the
order
to
report
was
valid.
he
claims
that
the
order
to
report
was
invalid
because
of
the
procedural
defect
and
hence
that
he
committed
no
crime
when
he
failed
to
take
his
step
forward
at
the
induction
station.
so,
we
think
that
his
motion
presented
a
purely
legal
defense
based
on
the
face
of
the
record
and
that,
under
the
common
law
principles
of
a
special
plea
at
bar
or
a
motion
at
bar,
that
does
not
qualify.
so,
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
this
court
did
not
reach
the
merits,
but
since
the
court
might
disagree
with
that,
i
will
now
proceed
to
the
merits.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
has
taken
the,
as
i
understand
it,
the
unqualified
position
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
as
i
indicated,
the
question
on
the
merits
quite
simply,
in
the
terms
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
is
whether
the
president
had
authority
from
congress
to
promulgate
the
selective
service
regulation
which
has
been
in
force,
i
might
say,
in
--
since
1940,
that
is,
throughout
the
entire
modern
history
of
selective
service.
whether
he
had
authority
to
adopt
that
regulation
which
reads
no
registrant
may
be
represented
at
his
personal
appearance
before
the
local
board
by
anyone
acting
as
attorney
or
legal
counsel.
and,
we
do
not
deny
that
if
the
district
court
was
right
in
holding
that
regulation
invalid,
that
the
indictment
should
in
fact
have
been
dismissed.
so,
the
question
is
the
validity
of
that
regulation
on
its
face.
before
i
go
on
to
discuss
the
arguments
made
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
appellee,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
put
the
question
in
context
by
describing
the
role
that
the
personal
appearance
has
in
the
selective
service
classification
process.
that
process
begins,
of
course,
when
a
young
man
registers
with
his
local
board.
subsequently,
the
board
sends
him
a
classification
questionnaire
which
he
fills
out
and
which
then
goes
into
a
selective
service
file
bearing
his
name,
together
with
any
other
written
information
of
any
kind
that
the
registrant
or
anyone
else
on
his
behalf
chooses
to
provide
to
the
board.
in
the
case
of
someone
who,
like
weller,
claims
to
be
a
conscientious
objector,
this
includes
the
form
150,
the
special
co
form
and
it
can
include,
under
the
regulations,
any
other
written
request
for
a
particular
classification
or
any
documents,
affidavits,
or
depositions
subject
only
to
the
condition
that
they
are
as
concise
and
as
brief
as
possible.
there's
nothing
to
stop
a
registrant
from
filing
complete
legal
brief
with
his
board
on
his
classification
if
he
chooses
to.
then,
when
the
time
comes,
the
board
classifies
each
registrant
at
a
formal
meeting
and
the
regulations
provide,
and
i
think
this
is
important,
quite
explicitly
that
the
classification
must
be
done
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
file
and
nothing
other
than
written
material
that
appears
in
that
file
and
of
course,
the
registrant
or
anyone
he
authorizes
has
the
right
to
inspect
that
file.
then,
after
the
board
makes
its
initial
classification
decision,
it
sends
a
notice
of
classification
to
the
registrant
and
then,
for
the
first
time,
he
has
a
right
to
the
personal
appearance
that
we
are
talking
about,
before
the
board
or
a
member
or
members
designated
for
the
purpose.
in
order
to
have
such
interview,
he
has
to
request
it
in
writing
30
days
--
within
30
days
after
the
notice
of
classification.
the
nature
of
the
personal
appearance
is
described
in
this
language
from
the
selective
service
regulations
which
appear
on
page
60
of
our
brief.
the
regulation
says
at
any
such
appearance,
the
registrant
may
discuss
his
classification,
may
point
out
the
class
or
classes
in
which
he
thinks
he
should
have
been
placed,
and
may
direct
attention
to
any
information
in
his
file
which
he
believes
the
local
board
has
overlooked
or
to
which
he
believes
it
is
not
given
sufficient
weight.
the
registrant
may
present
such
further
information
as
he
believes
will
assist
the
local
board
in
determining
his
proper
classification.
such
information
shall
be
in
writing
or,
if
oral,
shall
be
summarized
in
writing
by
the
registrant
and,
in
either
event,
shall
be
placed
in
the
registrant's
file.
the
section
before
that,
of
course,
prohibits
counsel.
that's
the
specific
regulation
we're
concerned
with,
and
that
regulation
also
provides
that
no
person
other
than
a
registrant
shall
have
the
right
to
appear
in
person
before
the
local
board,
but
the
local
board
may,
in
its
discretion,
permit
any
person
to
appear
before,
with
or
in
behalf
of
a
registrant
and
then
there's
a
provision
that
if
he
doesn't
speak
english,
he
can
have
an
interpreter.
typically,
there
is
not
a
stenographic
transcript
of
the
discussion
at
the
personal
appearance,
but
the
board
may
prepare
a
summary
as
the
board,
itself,
or
one
of
the
members
of
the
board
did
hear
and
put
it
in
the
file.
and,
as
i
indicated,
the
registrant
is
directed
by
the
regulation
to
prepare
his
own
summary
so
that
there
would
be
that
record
in
the
file
of
what
went
on,
and
this
ties
in
again
with
the
regulation
that
the
board
can
classify
only
on
the
basis
of
written
materials
appearing
in
the
file.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
there
is,
mr.
justice
white,
subject
to
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
explicit
provision
excluding
representation
by
an
attorney
or
a
legal
counsel.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
at
the
end
of
that
same
regulation,
which,
i
guess
is
on
page
61
of
our
--
60
or
61
--
i'm
sorry,
59.
i'm
sorry.
it's
rule
--
section
1624.1.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
this
all
appears
in
subsection
(b)
in
my
recollection.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
the
end,
provided
further
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
can't
be
a
lawyer
representing
him.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
could
have
a
lawyer
there,
but
not
as
--
not
strictly
as
a
lawyer
in
the
normal
professional
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
now,
i
think
it's
clear.
it
cannot
--
if
he's
acting
on
behalf
of
the
registrant,
it
amounts
to
legal
representation
which
in
the
context
of
his
case
to
what
the
appellee
is
talking
about
and
what
the
district
court
is
talking
about
is
a
lawyer
asking
questions,
making
arguments
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not,
as
a
customary
matter.
it
can
be
done.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
and
below,
of
course,
that
would
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
board.
the
board
might,
in
its
discretion,
do
something
that
was
reasonable,
say,
“we
don't
want
anybody
here.”
and
of
course,
if
the
case
ultimately
gets
into
court,
there
is
frequently
testimony
about
what
went
on
at
the
personal
appearance
by
the
registrar
and
by
the
board
members.
then
after
the
personal
appearance,
the
board
meets
again
to
reconsider
the
classification
and
sends
a
new
notice
of
classification
recording
the
result.
after
that,
the
man
has
three
days
to
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
and
he
can
submit
with
his
notion
--
with
his
notice
of
appeal
a
statement
specifying
the
matters
in
which
he
believes
the
local
board
erred.
in
other
words,
again,
a
brief
on
appeal
if
he
so
chooses,
and
the
appeal
board
then
classifies
him
again
de
novo
and
there
are
certain
limited
further
appeal
rights
to
the
national
appeal
board.
of
course,
a
lawyer
can
assist
the
registrant
in
preparing
any
of
these
written
materials
which,
again,
the
regulations
direct
the
board
to
base
its
decision
on.
it's
only
when
he
goes
and
he
discusses
his
case
orally
with
the
board
or
designated
members
of
it
that
he
is
on
his
own.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
will
--
i
had
planned
to
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
there's
quite
clear
congressional
authorization
and
in
fact,
congress
has
spoken
quite
clearly
on
this.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
is
so.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
the
discretion
is
subject
to
some
limits.
i
think
it
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
theoretically,
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
congress,
and
as
i
said
i
plan
to
get
to
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
congress
has
made
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
i
can
summarize
the
reasons
which
congress
has
gone
through
in
1967
in
connection
with
the
latest
revision
of
the
selective
service
act.
proposals
were
made
at
that
time,
both
in
the
house
committee,
and
in
fact
an
amendment
was
introduced
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
by
senator
morse,
both
proposals
explicitly
to
allow
representation
by
counsel
at
these
personal
appearances.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course,
that
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
--
i
don't
--
i
think
senator
morse's
amendment
was
restricted
to
counsel
though.
of
course,
one
of
the
problems,
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
think,
why
congress
shied
away
from
this
was
that
when
you
have
representation
by
counsel,
you
inevitably
have
a
different
kind
of
proceeding
from
the
relatively
informal
discussion
that
congress
had
in
mind.
but,
as
i
indicated,
congress
expressly
rejected
these
proposals
in
the
1967
act.
congress
has
spoken
on
this
issue
at
other
times.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
selective
service
act
expressly
exempting
selective
service
proceedings
from
the
administrative
procedure
act.
also,
in
1965,
there
was
a
statute
passed
relating
to
a
general
right
to
have
counsel
before
administrative
agencies,
and
the
house
report
on
that
bill
made
an
express
statement.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
in
context,
perhaps
i
should
--
what
i've
s
--
the
regulation
we
referred
to
speaks
about
persons
appearing
on
behalf
of
a
registrant.
it
is
possible,
there
are
provisions
allowing
the
board
to
subpoena
witnesses,
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
it's
not
done.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
perhaps,
now
as
i
look
at
it
more
closely,
i
think
i
should
amend
what
i
said
because
of
what
it
says,
but
the
local
board
may,
in
its
discretion,
permit
any
person
to
appear
before
it
with
or
on
behalf
of
a
registrant.
there
is
this
separate
subpoena
power.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
on
behalf
of
the
registrant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
well,
i
think
there
is
a
--
i
think,
a
distinction.
congressman
x
comes
in
and
says
“i
have
known
this
boy
all
my
life
and
he's
a
good
boy
and
he's
sincere
in
his
conscientious
objective
beliefs.”
i
think
what
a
lawyer
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
that's
speaking
on
his
behalf.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
“may
appear
with
or
on
behalf
of,”
and
then
the
prohibition
against
lawyers
says
“no
lawyer
may
represent.”
i
think
when
a
lawyer
comes
in
to
represent
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
what
congress
has
intended
to
exclude
is
a
lawyer
who
comes
in
for
the
purpose
of
what
i'm
doing
right
now.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
arguing
with
the
board,
citing
cases
to
it,
saying
the
welsh
case
means
this
and
the
seeger
case
means
that.
perhaps,
asking
questions
of
the
registrant
to
help
him
--
design
to
help
him
to
state
his
conscientious
objective
views
or,
for
example
if
it's
a
hardship
exemption
case,
to
--
trying
to
help
him
explain
his
exemption,
and
that
is
what
--
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
has
specifically,
and
by
design,
excluded.
now,
in
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
exactly
the
purpose.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
within
the
discretion
of
the
board
and
of
course,
in
this
case,
weller's
lawyer
asked
to
come
in
as
a
lawyer
and
that's
the
--
and
the
district
court
decided
it
on
the
basis
that
he
should
be
there
as
a
lawyer
so
that
he
could
ask
questions
and
clarify
matters
and
help
the
board
make
its
decision
in
the
sense
in
which
lawyers
ordinarily
do
when
they're
acting
as
lawyers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
the
regulation
says
absolutely
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
and
i
just,
indicating
a
little
further
about
what
purposes
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
trying
to
keep
this
in
a
relatively
informal
non-adversary
proceeding.
in
this
1965
legislation
i
refer
to,
relating
to
general
rights
of
counsel
before
administrative
agencies,
the
house
report
on
that
bill
noted
specifically
that,
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president,
a
registrant
may
not
be
represented
before
a
local
draft
board
by
an
attorney.
this
is
because
of
the
large
number
of
registrants
involved,
the
informality
of
procedures,
and
the
need
for
capacity
to
provide
large
numbers
of
men
quickly
for
service.
and,
again
in
connection
with
the
1967
draft
legislation,
there's
a
certain
amount
of
congressional
discussion
about
the
reasons
for
rejecting
the
proposals
then
that
there
should
be
lawyers,
again
suggesting
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
basic
duty
of
the
selective
services
to
which,
of
course,
this
court
has
recognized
on
numerous
occasions
and
recognized,
for
example
clark
against
gabriel
in
the
context
of
pre-induction
judicial
review,
that
the
purpose
of
the
selective
service
system
is
to
raise
large
numbers
of
men
without
litigious
interruptions
which
congress
has,
i
think,
reasonably
believed
would
impair
that
obligation.
there's
some
further
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
of
1967
another
congressional
feeling
which
again,
i
think
is
reasonable,
that
the
more
formalize
these
proceedings
become,
the
greater
advantage
is
given
to
those
who,
for
one
reason
or
another,
are
in
a
better
position
to
take
advantage
of
formalized
proceedings.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
don't
have
any
figures
on
that.
i
would
assume
that
a
substantial
percentage,
just
a
substantial
number
of
people
in
jobs
like
that
tend
to
be
lawyers.
a
substantial
number
are,
but
they
are
by
no
means
required
to
be
lawyers
or,
as
i
think,
chosen.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
there
is
not
and
that
again
is
i
think
a
problem
that
congress
could
reasonably
consider.
if
the
lawyer
comes
in
on
behalf
--
before
a
board
of
part
time
laymen
on
behalf
of
a
registrant
to
argue
with
them
about
what
the
welsh
case
means,
for
example,
i
think
the
board
would
rightly
feel
that
if
it
should
have
somebody
to
give
it
comparable
advice
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
which,
again,
tends
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
there
is
a
--
of
course,
as
a
national
office,
there
are
state
offices.
i
believe
there
may
be
lawyers
in
the
state
offices,
but
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
there
are
experts
there
to
give
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
there
is
no
provision
under
the
existing
system
for
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
to
be
with
at
its
meaning,
except
that
there
is
a
provision
for
the
appeal
agent.
there's
supposed
to
be
one
for
each
board
and
he
may
attend
meetings
at
the
request
of
the
board,
but
he
is
an
unpaid
volunteer.
i
think
it
would
quite
drastically
change
the
set
up
which
is
something
that
has
been
basically
in
existence,
as
i
indicated
before,
for
30
years.
it
would
rather
substantially
change
the
setup,
i
think,
if
you
started
to
make
these
adversary
proceedings
by
having
lawyers
coming
in
performing
the
kind
of
job
that
a
lawyer
ordinarily
does,
and
congress
has
made
the
express
decision
that
it
did
not
want
to
have
that
happen.
and,
as
articulated,
i
think
a
reasonable
basis
for
so
deciding.
of
course,
the
appellee
relies
quite
heavily
on
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
goldberg
and
kelley
case
on
procedural
rights
with
respect
to
welfare
terminations.
i
think,
as
with
all
of
these
matters,
you
can't
proceed
by
a
process
of
deductive
reasoning.
you
can't
say
that,
as
he
does,
the
personal
appearance
is
obviously
an
important
matter
for
the
draft
registrant.
it's
a
matter
in
which
his
personal
rights
are
determined,
therefore,
it
is
an
adjudicative
hearing.
in
every
adjudicative
hearing,
you
must
have
a
lawyer
because
the
court
said
so
in
goldberg
against
kelley,
therefore,
there
must
be
a
lawyer.
and,
if
the
whole
premise
of
the
goldberg
versus
kelley
decision
is
that
you
balance
each
situation,
the
result
there
was
a
relatively
limited
kind
of
hearing,
where
to
be
sure,
the
court
did
say
a
lawyer
should
be
present,
but
i
think
the
draft
situation
can't
be
deduced
from
that.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
making
the
same
kind
of
balancing
process
in
the
draft
context,
which
is
something
that
congress
has
done.
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated,
i
think
that
cannot
said
to
be
so
in
consistent
with
--
so
in
reasonable
or
so
consistent
with
principles
of
fundamental
fairness
that
it
should
be
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
i
don't
honestly
know
the
practical
facts.
i
do
know
that,
since
this
decision,
the
ninth
circuit
has
had
occasion
to
--
this
was
district
court
decision
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
had
occasion
to
reject
the
position
taken
by
--
of
the
district
judge,
judge
peckham,
in
this
case.
i
confess
that
i
haven't
determined
what
the
practical
effect
of
the
conflict
is.
presumably,
the
boards
can
rely
on
the
ninth
circuit
rather
than
on
the
district
court.
i
think,
in
this
context,
it's
i
think,
perhaps
the
appellee
overestimates,
and
it's
easy
to
overestimate
the
range
of
the
decision
making
discretion
that
a
local
board
has.
in
this
regard,
there
have
been
a
number
of
quite
significant
changes
in
the
recent
years
and,
in
fact,
recent
months.
for
example,
this
court's
newton
act
decision
last
term
took
away
from
the
boards
the
entire
power
that
they
had
previously
to
reclassify
people
whom
they
found
to
be
delinquents,
which
was
obviously
an
area
with
considerable
discretion
which
the
court
felt
that
the
boards
hadn't
been
given,
so
that
area
is
out.
as
of
last
spring,
occupational
deferments
were
discontinued,
so
the
questions
of
what's
an
essential
occupation
and
what
is
not
are
not
now
matters
that
the
boards
have
to
consider.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
was
by
executive
order,
these
regulations
are
made
by
the
president.
in
last
summer,
in
the
conscientious
objective
area
which
we
are
dealing
with
here,
following
the
decision
in
welsh,
specifically
last
term,
the
national
director
of
selective
service
put
out
a
two-page
statement
of
the
considerations
that
a
board
should
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
a
man
is
a
conscientious
objector
which,
i
think,
boils
down
–
there's
--
i
think
they
are
quite
comparable
to
the
kind
of
instructions
that
a
trial
judge
might
give
to
a
jury.
so,
the
board
is
focused,
and
it's
focused
principally
on
the
sincerity
issue
in
the
conscientious
objective
area
--
conscientious
objector
area
and
a
question
which
i
think
has
to
be
answered
necessarily
in
terms
of
what
the
registrant
says
out
of
his
own
mouth.
i
think
it's
not
a
matter
of
confronting
adverse
witnesses.
it's
not
a
matter
of
dealing
with
self-incrimination
problems
or
forfeiting
rights,
and
there's
nobody
there
arguing
against
him.
basically,
his
job
in
a
co
case
is
to
come
in
and
say
words
to
the
board
which
will
convince
the
board
of
the
nature
of
his
beliefs
and
of
the
sincerity
of
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
has,
in
a
case
which
we
cite
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
it's
possible
to
have
a
different
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
you
have
that
panel,
i
suppose
that
they
might
be
coming
en
banc
question
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
which
might
be
resolved
differently
in
that
court.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
the
question
answers
itself.
i
think
that
that's
not
so.
so
i
think,
in
light
of
the
--
in
summary,
in
light
of
the
unique
kind
of
situation
we
have
in
the
draft
classification
process
and
the
unique
role
of
the
personal
appearance,
i
think
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
since
every
other
kind
of
administrative
proceeding
or
most
others
allow
counsel
that
counsel
should
be
allowed
here.
i
think
the
court,
as
it
did
in
goldberg,
is
called
upon
to
weigh
the
unique
factors
in
the
selective
service
system
in
order
to
determine
what
fundamental
fairness
is
there.
i'd
like
to,
if
i
have
a
minute
or
two
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't,
unless
there
are
questions
that
the
court
would
like
to
ask.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
on
the
merits
of
this
case
is
the
validity
of
the
selective
service
regulation
that
says
that
a
registrant
may
not
be
represented
by
a
lawyer
when
he
has
his
personal
appearance
before
his
local
draft
board.
the
appellee,
weller,
was
classified
i-a
after
such
a
personal
appearance
or
rather
his
i-a
classification
was
retained,
going
to
the
procedures
after
a
bit,
after
such
a
personal
appearance,
but
he
refused
to
submit
to
induction
when
he
was
ordered
to
report
by
the
board
and,
accordingly,
he
was
indicted.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
before
trial
based
on
a
motion
filed,
actually
before
there
was
a
plea
to
the
indictment,
on
the
ground
that
weller's
lack
of
counsel
at
the
personal
appearance
invalidated
the
order
to
report
and,
the
united
states
has
appealed
from
that
order,
dismissing
the
indictment.
but
before
the
court
might
reach
the
merits,
there
is
a
threshold
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
government
can
appeal
this
dismissal
order
of
the
district
court
to
some
court.
the
question
is,
and
it's
a
difficult
one
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
whether
the
appeal
should
be
to
this
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
initially.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
understand,
i
don't
have
a
report
as
to
what
has
happened
this
morning.
the
report
i
had
yesterday
afternoon
is
that
a
bill,
in
which
the
senate
has
adopted
in
substance
the
government's
proposal
to
clear
up
this
area,
is
now
before
a
conference
committee.
the
house
has
not
passed
it.
it's
a
matter
of
getting
it
through
the
conference
committee
and
then
having
it
passed
by
the
house.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
may,
mr.
justice.
i'm
told
that
it
is
unlikely
however
that
it
would
be
intended
to
be
retroactive
to
cases
pending
on
appeal.
that
may
be
an
issue
that
will
come
back
to--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
can
hope
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
very
much
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
of
course
i
will
get
into
that,
although,
of
course,
we
initially
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
on
further
reflection.
the
solicitor
general
concluded
that
the
case
was
one
that
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
would
not
be
necessary,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
of
the
provision
in
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
says
if
an
appeal
is
improperly
brought
here
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
should
be
“remanded”
is
the
word,
but
if
you
--
of
course
we
filed,
in
lieu
of
a
jurisdictional
statement,
we
filed
something
called
a
motion
to
remand,
and
the
court
has
deferred
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
until
this
time.
so,
i
would
like
to
speak
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
outset
about
the
jurisdictional
question.
as
i
indicated,
this
case
comes
up
on
the
grant
of
the
motion
--
of
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
under
rule
12
of
the
criminal
rules
of
procedure.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
originally
based
on
two
grounds.
first,
a
claim
that
weller's
i-a
classification
was
improper
because
there
was
no
basis
in
fact
for
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim
and
second,
the
motion
asserted
the
claim
which
is
what
is
before
the
--
more
specifically,
before
the
court
now
that
the
order
of
the
court
was
invalid
because
weller
was,
in
several
respects
denied
due
process
at
his
personal
appearance
before
the
board,
principally
in
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
be
represent
by
counsel,
and
that
was
the
only
issue
that
has
survived
as
a
live
issue
to
this
point,
but
he
also
contended
initially
in
his
motion
that
the
local
board
had
improperly
denied
his
request
to
have
witnesses
with
him
and
to
have
a
court
reporter
transcribe
the
proceedings
of
the
personal
appearance.
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
and
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
itself
and
weller's
selective
service
file
which,
of
course,
was
undisputed
as
to
its
contents
which
had
been
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
he
filed.
the
file
--
the
selective
service
file
showed
on
its
face
that,
while
his
lawyer
had
written
letters
to
the
draft
board
asking
that
he
be
allowed
to
appear
with
weller
and
for
the
other
procedures
that
i've
mentioned
and
that
the
local
board
had
denied
them
in
reliance
on
the
regulations.
the
district
court
concluded
in
a
written
opinion
that
the
selective
service
regulation
in
question
here,
the
one
that
provides
that
no
registrant
may
be
represented
before
the
local
board
by
anyone
acting
as
attorney
or
legal
counsel
was
an
invalid
regulation.
it
did
not
directly
hold
that
the
regulation
was
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause.
instead,
it
followed
the
route
that
this
court
followed
in
the
greene
and
mcelroy
case,
some-11
years
ago,
relating
to
rights
of
confrontation
in
defense
department
security
clearance
proceedings.
the
district
court
considered
that
the
denial
of
counsel
before
the
local
draft
board
on
the
personal
appearance,
was
a
matter
of
doubtful
constitutionality,
and
therefore,
it
considered
that
the
regulation
could
not
be
valid
unless
there
was
express
congressional
authority
for
its
promulgation
by
the
president.
and,
the
district
court
found,
despite
the
circumstances
that
i
will
discuss
when
i
reach
the
merits
as
i
will,
the
district
court
decided
that
the
general
statutory
grant
of
authority
for
the
president
to
establish
selective
service
procedures
did
not
clearly
enough
authorize
him
to
promulgate
a
regulation
that
excluded
representation
by
counsel.
as
i
indicated,
it's
plain
that
this
dismissal
order
is
appealable
somewhere
since
it
came
before
the
trial
and
was
done
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
basis
of
a
procedural
defect
that
was
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
selective
service
record.
so,
the
only
question
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
whether
the
judgment
was
one
“based
on
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
or
information
is
founded”
or
in
the
alternative,
whether
it
was
a
“decision
or
judgment
sustaining
a
motion
at
bar.”
if
it
was
either
of
those,
then
the
appeal
would
be
directly
to
this
court.
we
say,
however,
that
it
was
neither
so
that
the
appeal
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
under
that
part
of
the
statute
which
gives
the
courts
of
appeals
jurisdiction
over
“any
decision
or
judgment
dismissing
any
indictment,
except
where
a
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
is
provided
by
this
section.”
of
course,
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
it
would
be
here,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
only
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
our
concern
is
more
--
rather,
than
a
narrow
concern
with
this
particular
litigation
is
with
the
administration
of
justice,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say.
assuming
that
we
do
not
have
a
new
legislation,
there
are
serious
questions
which
are,
if
nothing
else,
very
difficult
ones
for
the
government
in
deciding
where
to
proceed,
and
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
make
the
point
here
and
also,
we
believe
strongly
in
the
general
principles
of
this
underlying
much
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
that
cases
should
be
considered
in
the
courts
of
appeals
before
they
come
here.
and,
i
think
that
general
consideration
is
reflected
in
the
principle
that
underlies
the
majority
view
in
the
sisson
case
last
term,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
--
of
this
court's
cases
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
that
that
act
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
right,
mr.--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
as
i
will
try,
i
hope
briefly
to
articulate
our
reasons.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
it's
clear.
there's
no
question
of
jeopardy
here.
this
motion
was
filed
even
before
a
plea
was
made.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
having
brought
it
here,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
by
the
filing
of
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
district
court
called
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
of
course,
we
raised
this
at
the
first
stage
at
which
we
filed
any
papers
in
this
court.
we
had
a
dilemma,
frankly
as
we
frequently
have
under
this
act,
in
knowing
where
to
go
first.
i
think
the
principle
--
the
basic
principle
in
which
this
question
ought
to
be
considered
is
the
principle,
as
i
indicated,
as
the
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
a
technical
statute
that
historically
arose
from
a
clear
congressional
compromise
rather
than
from
a
single
coherent
all-embracing
legislative
purpose
and,
therefore,
that
it
should
be
read
narrowly.
and,
i
think
that
principle
is
especially
apt
in
this
situation
where
the
issue
is
not
whether
there
is
an
appeal
or
not,
but
simply
where
it
should
be.
so,
in
a
sense,
the
practical
issue
is
an
issue
of
the
management
of
appellate
business
rather
than
deciding
whether
or
not
a
litigant,
that
is
the
government,
has
a
right
to
appeal
or
not.
so,
in
that
sense,
i
think
the
--
it
might
be
said
that
less
is
at
stake
than,
for
example,
in
the
sisson
case
where
it
was
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
appeal
at
all.
in
light
of
that,
we
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
burden
of
argumentative
persuasion
should
be
on
those
who
say
that
the
appeal
should
come
directly
to
this
court,
short-circuiting
the
more
conventional
initial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
this
respect,
it
is
somewhat
like
the
principles
that
have
under
--
that
underlie
some
of
the
court's
decisions
in
the
three-judge
court
area
in
civil
cases
where
there's
a
similar
principle
of
narrow
reading
of
a
technical
statute.
let
me
then
turn
to
the
two
statutory
issues.
first,
the
question
whether
the
dismissal
of
weller's
indictment
on
the
ground
that
a
procedural
regulation
followed
by
the
local
draft
board
was
insufficiently
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
appellee
says
that
that
is
--
that
decision
amounted
to
a
construction
of
the
statute
on
which
the
indictment
is
based,
that
is,
the
selective
service
act.
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
the
dismissal
was
based
on
the
regulation,
not
on
the
act,
and
the
court
held
the
regulation
to
be
invalid
under
a
principle
of,
i
guess
you'd
call
it,
general
law
that
regulations
impairing
procedural
rights
are
invalid
unless
congress
has
specifically
authorized
them.
the
only
reference
to
the
statute,
therefore,
was
a
negative
one
and
we
do
not
think
that
a
determination
that
an
act
does
not
say
something
on
a
subject
has
to
be
treated
as
a
“construction”
of
the
statute
under
this
technical
act
which,
as
we
say,
should
be
read
narrowly.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
does
not.
it's
a
regulation
under
a
general
authorization
issue.
so,
in
that
respect,
it
is
different
from
the
mersky
case,
i
think,
where
the
regulation
was,
first,
a
substantive
regulation
and,
second
one,
directly
contemplated
by
the
statute
to
fill
out
a
gap
left
by
mistake.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
was
filed
before
sisson.
the
decision
was
filed
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
clearly
it
was
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
it
was
early
this
year.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
clearly
a
matter
of
cannot,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
pardon?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
was
born
in
1944,
so
he
would
now
be
26.
of
course,
he
is
under
--
the
issue
is
the
criminal
indictment
for
a
failure
to
report.
he
was
due
to
report
in
i
believe,
the
summer
of
1968
and
the
criminal
proceedings
have
been
pending
since,
shortly
after
that
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
not
sure
exactly
when
his
birthday
is,
mr.
justice
black,
nor
can
i
speak
authoritatively
as
to
the
effect
that
all
of
this
may
have
on
his
future.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
–
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
it
could
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
of
course,
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
that
once
the
case
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
we
say
it
should
be,
then
it
would
be
open
to
a
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
certiorari
before
judgment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though
i
think
that's
not
available
now
because
the
case
is
not
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
so
we
do
think
that
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
situation
from
the
mersky
situation
where
the
court
could
say
and
–
that
--
or
did
say,
again
over
the
government's
contrary
argument,
that
the
regulations
were
so
closely
intertwined
with
the
statute
that
the
issue
of
interpretation
of
the
regulation
should
be
considered
as
an
issue
of
interpretation
of
the
statute.
this
brings
me
to
the
motion
at
bar
point,
which
the
appellee
urges
alternatively
as
a
basis
for
this
court's
jurisdiction.
i
think
sisson,
again,
makes
it
clear
that
the
question
of
what
a
motion
at
bar
is,
is
a
question
that
is
still
open,
but
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
definition
suggested
by
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
the
mersky
case
which
would
limit
a
motion
at
bar
to
matters
in
confession
and
avoidance,
such
as
res
judicata
or
the
statute
of
limitations
or
denial
of
speedy
trial.
that
is
limited
to
defenses
that
do
not
go
to
the
general
issue,
but
which
solely
on
the
basis
of
new
matter
would
prevent
a
conviction
even
if
the
defendant
committed
the
criminal
acts
that
are
charged.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
except,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
this
is
not
new
matter.
i
think
it
has
to
be
said
that
implicit
in
the
indictment
is
an
allegation
that
the
process
of
classification,
that
is,
the
order
to
report
for
induction
was
a
valid
and
proper
order.
i
notice
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
couple
of
words
more
about
jurisdiction
and
then
move
on
to
the
merits
if
i
can.
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
point
about
the
applicability
of
a
motion
at
bar
when
we
paused
at
the
lunch
hour.
as
i
indicated,
we
think
that
that
clause
should
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
the
common
law
concept
of
a
special
plain
bar
and
there
are
indications
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
is
in
fact,
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1970
when
it
passed
the
act.
that
is,
the
principle
is
that
a
motion
at
bar
relates
only
to
a
defense
that
does
not
go
to
the
general
issue
and
which,
on
the
basis
of
new
matter,
would
prevent
a
conviction
even
if
the
defendant
committed
the
acts
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not,
because
mersky
has
held
nothing
about
the
motion
at
bar.
the
mersky--
in
mersky,
the
court
found
--
the
majority
found
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
by
–
size
--
side
play,
your
honor.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
--
that
unfortunately
is
necessary,
finally,
i
think
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
just
had
another
indication
at
lunch
time.
it
is
in
the,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
it
is
in
the
house
of
senate
conference
committee
on
the
law
enforcement
assistance.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
it's,
as
i
understand,
the
law
enforcement
assistance
bill.
it
has
been
passed
by
the
senate
with
the
criminal
appeals
act
amendment
in
it.
the
house
has
not,
that's
a
writer
and
--
well,
the
house
has
apparently
passed
the
basic
bill.
the
house
has
not
passed,
specifically,
the
amendment.
so,
it's
a
matter
of
working
it
out
in
the
conference
and
getting
it
done.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
would
--
well,
i
think
it
would
because
i
understand
the
bill
would
quite
clearly
resolve
this
problem.
in
fact,
there
--
i
have
had
some
indications
the
bill
may
eventually
come
out
with
a
provision
only
for
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
reserving
this
court
before
certiorari.
in
any
event,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
bill,
if
it's
accepted
in
anything
like
the
form
in
which
it
has
been
so
far,
would
not
allow
direct
appeal
in
any
case
that
does
not
involve
the
validity
of
the
underlying
statute,
so
that
we
wouldn't
have
this
construction
of
statute
issue
or
the
motion
at
bar
issue
i
think,
clearly,
as
i
understand
the
bill.
the
point,
i
think,
on
this
notion
of
a
motion
at
bar
as
something
raising
new
matter
that
would
prevent
a
conviction
even
if
the
defendant
has
committed
the
acts
of
which
he's
charged
is
that
the
defense
that
weller
has
raised
here
is
not
that
kind
of
defense.
his
defense
raised
in
his
motion
is
that
there
was
no
offense.
he's
not
confessing
the
events
and
saying
there's
some
external
reason
why
i
can't
be
convicted
for
it.
he
says
there
is
no
offense
because
implicit
in
the
indictment
is
an
allegation
that
the
order
to
report
for
induction
was
invalid.
he
claims
that
this
order
--
excuse
me,
the
order
to
report
was
valid.
he
claims
that
the
order
to
report
was
invalid
because
of
the
procedural
defect
and
hence
that
he
committed
no
crime
when
he
failed
to
take
his
step
forward
at
the
induction
station.
so,
we
think
that
his
motion
presented
a
purely
legal
defense
based
on
the
face
of
the
record
and
that,
under
the
common
law
principles
of
a
special
plea
at
bar
or
a
motion
at
bar,
that
does
not
qualify.
so,
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
this
court
did
not
reach
the
merits,
but
since
the
court
might
disagree
with
that,
i
will
now
proceed
to
the
merits.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
has
taken
the,
as
i
understand
it,
the
unqualified
position
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
as
i
indicated,
the
question
on
the
merits
quite
simply,
in
the
terms
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
is
whether
the
president
had
authority
from
congress
to
promulgate
the
selective
service
regulation
which
has
been
in
force,
i
might
say,
in
--
since
1940,
that
is,
throughout
the
entire
modern
history
of
selective
service.
whether
he
had
authority
to
adopt
that
regulation
which
reads
no
registrant
may
be
represented
at
his
personal
appearance
before
the
local
board
by
anyone
acting
as
attorney
or
legal
counsel.
and,
we
do
not
deny
that
if
the
district
court
was
right
in
holding
that
regulation
invalid,
that
the
indictment
should
in
fact
have
been
dismissed.
so,
the
question
is
the
validity
of
that
regulation
on
its
face.
before
i
go
on
to
discuss
the
arguments
made
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
appellee,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
put
the
question
in
context
by
describing
the
role
that
the
personal
appearance
has
in
the
selective
service
classification
process.
that
process
begins,
of
course,
when
a
young
man
registers
with
his
local
board.
subsequently,
the
board
sends
him
a
classification
questionnaire
which
he
fills
out
and
which
then
goes
into
a
selective
service
file
bearing
his
name,
together
with
any
other
written
information
of
any
kind
that
the
registrant
or
anyone
else
on
his
behalf
chooses
to
provide
to
the
board.
in
the
case
of
someone
who,
like
weller,
claims
to
be
a
conscientious
objector,
this
includes
the
form
150,
the
special
co
form
and
it
can
include,
under
the
regulations,
any
other
written
request
for
a
particular
classification
or
any
documents,
affidavits,
or
depositions
subject
only
to
the
condition
that
they
are
as
concise
and
as
brief
as
possible.
there's
nothing
to
stop
a
registrant
from
filing
complete
legal
brief
with
his
board
on
his
classification
if
he
chooses
to.
then,
when
the
time
comes,
the
board
classifies
each
registrant
at
a
formal
meeting
and
the
regulations
provide,
and
i
think
this
is
important,
quite
explicitly
that
the
classification
must
be
done
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
file
and
nothing
other
than
written
material
that
appears
in
that
file
and
of
course,
the
registrant
or
anyone
he
authorizes
has
the
right
to
inspect
that
file.
then,
after
the
board
makes
its
initial
classification
decision,
it
sends
a
notice
of
classification
to
the
registrant
and
then,
for
the
first
time,
he
has
a
right
to
the
personal
appearance
that
we
are
talking
about,
before
the
board
or
a
member
or
members
designated
for
the
purpose.
in
order
to
have
such
interview,
he
has
to
request
it
in
writing
30
days
--
within
30
days
after
the
notice
of
classification.
the
nature
of
the
personal
appearance
is
described
in
this
language
from
the
selective
service
regulations
which
appear
on
page
60
of
our
brief.
the
regulation
says
at
any
such
appearance,
the
registrant
may
discuss
his
classification,
may
point
out
the
class
or
classes
in
which
he
thinks
he
should
have
been
placed,
and
may
direct
attention
to
any
information
in
his
file
which
he
believes
the
local
board
has
overlooked
or
to
which
he
believes
it
is
not
given
sufficient
weight.
the
registrant
may
present
such
further
information
as
he
believes
will
assist
the
local
board
in
determining
his
proper
classification.
such
information
shall
be
in
writing
or,
if
oral,
shall
be
summarized
in
writing
by
the
registrant
and,
in
either
event,
shall
be
placed
in
the
registrant's
file.
the
section
before
that,
of
course,
prohibits
counsel.
that's
the
specific
regulation
we're
concerned
with,
and
that
regulation
also
provides
that
no
person
other
than
a
registrant
shall
have
the
right
to
appear
in
person
before
the
local
board,
but
the
local
board
may,
in
its
discretion,
permit
any
person
to
appear
before,
with
or
in
behalf
of
a
registrant
and
then
there's
a
provision
that
if
he
doesn't
speak
english,
he
can
have
an
interpreter.
typically,
there
is
not
a
stenographic
transcript
of
the
discussion
at
the
personal
appearance,
but
the
board
may
prepare
a
summary
as
the
board,
itself,
or
one
of
the
members
of
the
board
did
hear
and
put
it
in
the
file.
and,
as
i
indicated,
the
registrant
is
directed
by
the
regulation
to
prepare
his
own
summary
so
that
there
would
be
that
record
in
the
file
of
what
went
on,
and
this
ties
in
again
with
the
regulation
that
the
board
can
classify
only
on
the
basis
of
written
materials
appearing
in
the
file.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
there
is,
mr.
justice
white,
subject
to
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
explicit
provision
excluding
representation
by
an
attorney
or
a
legal
counsel.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
at
the
end
of
that
same
regulation,
which,
i
guess
is
on
page
61
of
our
--
60
or
61
--
i'm
sorry,
59.
i'm
sorry.
it's
rule
--
section
1624.1.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
this
all
appears
in
subsection
(b)
in
my
recollection.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
the
end,
provided
further
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
can't
be
a
lawyer
representing
him.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
could
have
a
lawyer
there,
but
not
as
--
not
strictly
as
a
lawyer
in
the
normal
professional
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
now,
i
think
it's
clear.
it
cannot
--
if
he's
acting
on
behalf
of
the
registrant,
it
amounts
to
legal
representation
which
in
the
context
of
his
case
to
what
the
appellee
is
talking
about
and
what
the
district
court
is
talking
about
is
a
lawyer
asking
questions,
making
arguments
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not,
as
a
customary
matter.
it
can
be
done.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
and
below,
of
course,
that
would
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
board.
the
board
might,
in
its
discretion,
do
something
that
was
reasonable,
say,
“we
don't
want
anybody
here.”
and
of
course,
if
the
case
ultimately
gets
into
court,
there
is
frequently
testimony
about
what
went
on
at
the
personal
appearance
by
the
registrar
and
by
the
board
members.
then
after
the
personal
appearance,
the
board
meets
again
to
reconsider
the
classification
and
sends
a
new
notice
of
classification
recording
the
result.
after
that,
the
man
has
three
days
to
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
and
he
can
submit
with
his
notion
--
with
his
notice
of
appeal
a
statement
specifying
the
matters
in
which
he
believes
the
local
board
erred.
in
other
words,
again,
a
brief
on
appeal
if
he
so
chooses,
and
the
appeal
board
then
classifies
him
again
de
novo
and
there
are
certain
limited
further
appeal
rights
to
the
national
appeal
board.
of
course,
a
lawyer
can
assist
the
registrant
in
preparing
any
of
these
written
materials
which,
again,
the
regulations
direct
the
board
to
base
its
decision
on.
it's
only
when
he
goes
and
he
discusses
his
case
orally
with
the
board
or
designated
members
of
it
that
he
is
on
his
own.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
will
--
i
had
planned
to
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
there's
quite
clear
congressional
authorization
and
in
fact,
congress
has
spoken
quite
clearly
on
this.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
is
so.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
the
discretion
is
subject
to
some
limits.
i
think
it
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
theoretically,
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
congress,
and
as
i
said
i
plan
to
get
to
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
congress
has
made
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
i
can
summarize
the
reasons
which
congress
has
gone
through
in
1967
in
connection
with
the
latest
revision
of
the
selective
service
act.
proposals
were
made
at
that
time,
both
in
the
house
committee,
and
in
fact
an
amendment
was
introduced
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
by
senator
morse,
both
proposals
explicitly
to
allow
representation
by
counsel
at
these
personal
appearances.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course,
that
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
--
i
don't
--
i
think
senator
morse's
amendment
was
restricted
to
counsel
though.
of
course,
one
of
the
problems,
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
think,
why
congress
shied
away
from
this
was
that
when
you
have
representation
by
counsel,
you
inevitably
have
a
different
kind
of
proceeding
from
the
relatively
informal
discussion
that
congress
had
in
mind.
but,
as
i
indicated,
congress
expressly
rejected
these
proposals
in
the
1967
act.
congress
has
spoken
on
this
issue
at
other
times.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
selective
service
act
expressly
exempting
selective
service
proceedings
from
the
administrative
procedure
act.
also,
in
1965,
there
was
a
statute
passed
relating
to
a
general
right
to
have
counsel
before
administrative
agencies,
and
the
house
report
on
that
bill
made
an
express
statement.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
in
context,
perhaps
i
should
--
what
i've
s
--
the
regulation
we
referred
to
speaks
about
persons
appearing
on
behalf
of
a
registrant.
it
is
possible,
there
are
provisions
allowing
the
board
to
subpoena
witnesses,
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
it's
not
done.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
perhaps,
now
as
i
look
at
it
more
closely,
i
think
i
should
amend
what
i
said
because
of
what
it
says,
but
the
local
board
may,
in
its
discretion,
permit
any
person
to
appear
before
it
with
or
on
behalf
of
a
registrant.
there
is
this
separate
subpoena
power.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
on
behalf
of
the
registrant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
well,
i
think
there
is
a
--
i
think,
a
distinction.
congressman
x
comes
in
and
says
“i
have
known
this
boy
all
my
life
and
he's
a
good
boy
and
he's
sincere
in
his
conscientious
objective
beliefs.”
i
think
what
a
lawyer
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
that's
speaking
on
his
behalf.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
“may
appear
with
or
on
behalf
of,”
and
then
the
prohibition
against
lawyers
says
“no
lawyer
may
represent.”
i
think
when
a
lawyer
comes
in
to
represent
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
what
congress
has
intended
to
exclude
is
a
lawyer
who
comes
in
for
the
purpose
of
what
i'm
doing
right
now.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
arguing
with
the
board,
citing
cases
to
it,
saying
the
welsh
case
means
this
and
the
seeger
case
means
that.
perhaps,
asking
questions
of
the
registrant
to
help
him
--
design
to
help
him
to
state
his
conscientious
objective
views
or,
for
example
if
it's
a
hardship
exemption
case,
to
--
trying
to
help
him
explain
his
exemption,
and
that
is
what
--
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
has
specifically,
and
by
design,
excluded.
now,
in
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
exactly
the
purpose.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
within
the
discretion
of
the
board
and
of
course,
in
this
case,
weller's
lawyer
asked
to
come
in
as
a
lawyer
and
that's
the
--
and
the
district
court
decided
it
on
the
basis
that
he
should
be
there
as
a
lawyer
so
that
he
could
ask
questions
and
clarify
matters
and
help
the
board
make
its
decision
in
the
sense
in
which
lawyers
ordinarily
do
when
they're
acting
as
lawyers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
the
regulation
says
absolutely
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
and
i
just,
indicating
a
little
further
about
what
purposes
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
trying
to
keep
this
in
a
relatively
informal
non-adversary
proceeding.
in
this
1965
legislation
i
refer
to,
relating
to
general
rights
of
counsel
before
administrative
agencies,
the
house
report
on
that
bill
noted
specifically
that,
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
president,
a
registrant
may
not
be
represented
before
a
local
draft
board
by
an
attorney.
this
is
because
of
the
large
number
of
registrants
involved,
the
informality
of
procedures,
and
the
need
for
capacity
to
provide
large
numbers
of
men
quickly
for
service.
and,
again
in
connection
with
the
1967
draft
legislation,
there's
a
certain
amount
of
congressional
discussion
about
the
reasons
for
rejecting
the
proposals
then
that
there
should
be
lawyers,
again
suggesting
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
basic
duty
of
the
selective
services
to
which,
of
course,
this
court
has
recognized
on
numerous
occasions
and
recognized,
for
example
clark
against
gabriel
in
the
context
of
pre-induction
judicial
review,
that
the
purpose
of
the
selective
service
system
is
to
raise
large
numbers
of
men
without
litigious
interruptions
which
congress
has,
i
think,
reasonably
believed
would
impair
that
obligation.
there's
some
further
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
of
1967
another
congressional
feeling
which
again,
i
think
is
reasonable,
that
the
more
formalize
these
proceedings
become,
the
greater
advantage
is
given
to
those
who,
for
one
reason
or
another,
are
in
a
better
position
to
take
advantage
of
formalized
proceedings.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
don't
have
any
figures
on
that.
i
would
assume
that
a
substantial
percentage,
just
a
substantial
number
of
people
in
jobs
like
that
tend
to
be
lawyers.
a
substantial
number
are,
but
they
are
by
no
means
required
to
be
lawyers
or,
as
i
think,
chosen.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
there
is
not
and
that
again
is
i
think
a
problem
that
congress
could
reasonably
consider.
if
the
lawyer
comes
in
on
behalf
--
before
a
board
of
part
time
laymen
on
behalf
of
a
registrant
to
argue
with
them
about
what
the
welsh
case
means,
for
example,
i
think
the
board
would
rightly
feel
that
if
it
should
have
somebody
to
give
it
comparable
advice
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
which,
again,
tends
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
there
is
a
--
of
course,
as
a
national
office,
there
are
state
offices.
i
believe
there
may
be
lawyers
in
the
state
offices,
but
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
there
are
experts
there
to
give
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
there
is
no
provision
under
the
existing
system
for
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
to
be
with
at
its
meaning,
except
that
there
is
a
provision
for
the
appeal
agent.
there's
supposed
to
be
one
for
each
board
and
he
may
attend
meetings
at
the
request
of
the
board,
but
he
is
an
unpaid
volunteer.
i
think
it
would
quite
drastically
change
the
set
up
which
is
something
that
has
been
basically
in
existence,
as
i
indicated
before,
for
30
years.
it
would
rather
substantially
change
the
setup,
i
think,
if
you
started
to
make
these
adversary
proceedings
by
having
lawyers
coming
in
performing
the
kind
of
job
that
a
lawyer
ordinarily
does,
and
congress
has
made
the
express
decision
that
it
did
not
want
to
have
that
happen.
and,
as
articulated,
i
think
a
reasonable
basis
for
so
deciding.
of
course,
the
appellee
relies
quite
heavily
on
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
goldberg
and
kelley
case
on
procedural
rights
with
respect
to
welfare
terminations.
i
think,
as
with
all
of
these
matters,
you
can't
proceed
by
a
process
of
deductive
reasoning.
you
can't
say
that,
as
he
does,
the
personal
appearance
is
obviously
an
important
matter
for
the
draft
registrant.
it's
a
matter
in
which
his
personal
rights
are
determined,
therefore,
it
is
an
adjudicative
hearing.
in
every
adjudicative
hearing,
you
must
have
a
lawyer
because
the
court
said
so
in
goldberg
against
kelley,
therefore,
there
must
be
a
lawyer.
and,
if
the
whole
premise
of
the
goldberg
versus
kelley
decision
is
that
you
balance
each
situation,
the
result
there
was
a
relatively
limited
kind
of
hearing,
where
to
be
sure,
the
court
did
say
a
lawyer
should
be
present,
but
i
think
the
draft
situation
can't
be
deduced
from
that.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
making
the
same
kind
of
balancing
process
in
the
draft
context,
which
is
something
that
congress
has
done.
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated,
i
think
that
cannot
said
to
be
so
in
consistent
with
--
so
in
reasonable
or
so
consistent
with
principles
of
fundamental
fairness
that
it
should
be
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
i
don't
honestly
know
the
practical
facts.
i
do
know
that,
since
this
decision,
the
ninth
circuit
has
had
occasion
to
--
this
was
district
court
decision
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
had
occasion
to
reject
the
position
taken
by
--
of
the
district
judge,
judge
peckham,
in
this
case.
i
confess
that
i
haven't
determined
what
the
practical
effect
of
the
conflict
is.
presumably,
the
boards
can
rely
on
the
ninth
circuit
rather
than
on
the
district
court.
i
think,
in
this
context,
it's
i
think,
perhaps
the
appellee
overestimates,
and
it's
easy
to
overestimate
the
range
of
the
decision
making
discretion
that
a
local
board
has.
in
this
regard,
there
have
been
a
number
of
quite
significant
changes
in
the
recent
years
and,
in
fact,
recent
months.
for
example,
this
court's
newton
act
decision
last
term
took
away
from
the
boards
the
entire
power
that
they
had
previously
to
reclassify
people
whom
they
found
to
be
delinquents,
which
was
obviously
an
area
with
considerable
discretion
which
the
court
felt
that
the
boards
hadn't
been
given,
so
that
area
is
out.
as
of
last
spring,
occupational
deferments
were
discontinued,
so
the
questions
of
what's
an
essential
occupation
and
what
is
not
are
not
now
matters
that
the
boards
have
to
consider.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
was
by
executive
order,
these
regulations
are
made
by
the
president.
in
last
summer,
in
the
conscientious
objective
area
which
we
are
dealing
with
here,
following
the
decision
in
welsh,
specifically
last
term,
the
national
director
of
selective
service
put
out
a
two-page
statement
of
the
considerations
that
a
board
should
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
a
man
is
a
conscientious
objector
which,
i
think,
boils
down
–
there's
--
i
think
they
are
quite
comparable
to
the
kind
of
instructions
that
a
trial
judge
might
give
to
a
jury.
so,
the
board
is
focused,
and
it's
focused
principally
on
the
sincerity
issue
in
the
conscientious
objective
area
--
conscientious
objector
area
and
a
question
which
i
think
has
to
be
answered
necessarily
in
terms
of
what
the
registrant
says
out
of
his
own
mouth.
i
think
it's
not
a
matter
of
confronting
adverse
witnesses.
it's
not
a
matter
of
dealing
with
self-incrimination
problems
or
forfeiting
rights,
and
there's
nobody
there
arguing
against
him.
basically,
his
job
in
a
co
case
is
to
come
in
and
say
words
to
the
board
which
will
convince
the
board
of
the
nature
of
his
beliefs
and
of
the
sincerity
of
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
has,
in
a
case
which
we
cite
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
it's
possible
to
have
a
different
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
you
have
that
panel,
i
suppose
that
they
might
be
coming
en
banc
question
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
which
might
be
resolved
differently
in
that
court.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
the
question
answers
itself.
i
think
that
that's
not
so.
so
i
think,
in
light
of
the
--
in
summary,
in
light
of
the
unique
kind
of
situation
we
have
in
the
draft
classification
process
and
the
unique
role
of
the
personal
appearance,
i
think
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
since
every
other
kind
of
administrative
proceeding
or
most
others
allow
counsel
that
counsel
should
be
allowed
here.
i
think
the
court,
as
it
did
in
goldberg,
is
called
upon
to
weigh
the
unique
factors
in
the
selective
service
system
in
order
to
determine
what
fundamental
fairness
is
there.
i'd
like
to,
if
i
have
a
minute
or
two
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't,
unless
there
are
questions
that
the
court
would
like
to
ask.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
