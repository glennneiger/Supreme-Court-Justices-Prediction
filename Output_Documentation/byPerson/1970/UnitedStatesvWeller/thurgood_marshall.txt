justice
thurgood
marshall
without
the
hearing,
the
board
in
its
discretion
can
let
anybody
under
the
sun
get
in
except
the
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
include
the
county
political
leader?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
chamber
of
commerce?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
any
other
good
person.
well,
what's
wrong
with
the
law
here,
why
is
he
excluded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
congress
has
made
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
up
that
the
law
is
that
they
didn't
want
themselves
to
be
litigants.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
real
full
hearings,
wasn't
that
in
that
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
more
--
i
mean,
a
more
detailed
hearing
and
that
was
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that,
in
this
case,
congressman
x
would
appear
at
the
hearing
as
congressman
x,
but
he
couldn't
appear
as
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
board,
they
could
let
anybody
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
congressman
x
could
come
in
there
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
on
behalf
of
him
as
congressman
x,
but
if
he
says
“i
appear
here
as
lawyer
x,
representing
him,”
his
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he's
not
representing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
say
“or
represent”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
if
the
man
says
that
“i
knew
the
registrant
for
a
long
time,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
mr.
springer's
point
that
your
position
is
that
no
crime
is
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
crime
could've
been
that
it
was
an
invalid
induction
law.
it's
the
only
way
to
find
it,
isn't
that
what
you
mean?
do
you
say
that
the
induction
law
was
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
doubt.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
only
difference
is
as
to
whether
or
not
the
valid
induction
order
is
a
part
of
the
act.
the
solicitor
general
says
it
is
a
part
and
you
say
it's
not
a
part.
the
act
is
only
to
pay
to
take
the
one
step
further,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who's
the
adversary
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
object
to
the
prosecutor
and
jury,
all
judge
all
the
same,
you
can't
argue
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
can't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
can't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
only
people
there
are
the
board,
the
clerk,
and
the
man.
so,
it's
got
to
be
the
clerk
or
the
board
in
order
for
you
to
get
your
adversary.
you
put
so
much
weight
on
these
adversary
procedures.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find,
who
are
the
two
contestants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
using
your
language
of
justice
brandeis,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
who's
the
other
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
the

the

in
its

can
let
anybody
under
