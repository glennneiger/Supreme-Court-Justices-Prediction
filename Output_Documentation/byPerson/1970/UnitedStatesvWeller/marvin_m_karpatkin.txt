mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
selective
service
case
which
the
supreme
court
is
hearing
this
week.
unlike
gillette
and
negre,
which
were
argued
yesterday
however,
this
case
does
not
involve
cosmic
questions
of
the
definition
of
a
man's
conscience,
of
the
nature
of
his
religious
beliefs
the
character
of
conscientious
objection,
the
relationship
between
total
objection
and
selective
objection.
it
involves,
rather,
the
more
mundane,
but
no
less
you
pick
with
this
question
of
fairness
in
the
operation
of
the
selective
service
system.
the
administrative
agency
which
determines
which
man
shall
be
drafted
and
which
man
shall
not.
last
term,
this
court
was
deeply
divided
in
a
case
which
raised
the
question
of
the
proper
definition
of
conscientious
objection
and
the
relationship
between
the
religious
and
the
non-religious
objector,
i'm
referring,
of
course,
to
the
welsh
case.
but
this
court
was
unanimous
in
its
declaration
in
the
malloy
case
that
full
and
fair
administrative
review
is
indispensible
to
the
fair
operation
of
the
selective
service
system.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
the
backdrop
in
the
malloy
case,
as
is
likewise
the
backdrop
in
this
case,
is
the
extremely
limited
judicial
review
of
selective
service
administrative
decisions.
this
is
a
standard
of
judicial
review
which
this
court
has
declared
since
the
estep
case
in
1946
and
continues
to
reiterate
whenever
there
is
a
selective
case
before
it.
that
the
decisions
of
the
local
boards
and
the
appeal
boards
of
the
selective
service
system
must
be
approved
by
the
courts
even
if
they
are
erroneous
decisions
so
long
as
they
are
not
without
a
basis
in
fact.
i
submit
that
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
emergence
of
the
doctrine
that
the
selective
service
system
is
to
be
treated
like
any
other
administrative
agency
which
adjudicates
personal
and
property
rights
and
that
it
can
operate
fairly
unless
only
if
the
person
affected
has
the
right
to
a
meaningful
hearing
before
action
is
taken
which
affects
him.
and,
that
under
a
parade
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts,
there
is
no
meaningful
hearing
unless
the
person
who
was
subjected
to
these
sanctions
by
an
administrative
agency,
who
was
subjected
to
these
deprivations
and
effects
upon
his
personal
and
property
rights,
has
the
right
to
the
advice,
the
assistance,
and
the
presence
of
counsel
at
the
scene
of
such
hearing.
this
is
the
essence
of
the
decision
of
judge
peckham
below,
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
when
the
solicitor
general
states
that
judge
peckham's
decision
in
the
northern
district
of
california
was
based
only
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
regulation
was
authorized
by
statute.
the
same
words
which
judge
peckham
uses
to
declare
the
denial
of
counsel,
that
is
the
regulation
prohibiting
the
appearance
of
counsel
as
not
being
authorized
by
congress,
is
likewise
the
same
words
which
judge
peckham
uses
in
concluding
that
the
prohibition
of
counsel
is
without
constitutional
sanction.
i
may
say
finally,
in
terms
of
the
setting
of
this
case,
that
this
case
also
involves,
i
respectfully
submit,
the
exorcising
of
a
myth.
the
myth
that
selective
service
local
boards
are
not
administrative
tribunals
like
hundreds
or
thousands
of
other
administrative
tribunals
around
the
country,
federal
and
state,
but
some
kind
of
informal
(inaudible)
after-church
discussion
groups,
colloquially
called
little
groups
of
neighbors
and
that,
therefore,
they
should
not
be
held
to
the
same
standards
as
other
agencies
which
affect
personal
and
property
rights.
this
myth,
i
submit,
was
always
based
on
a
fiction,
but
the
myth
has
now
been
officially
disembodied
by
a
change
in
the
regulations
mentioned
in
our
brief,
which
i
will
get
to
later
in
my
argument,
and
the
time
has
long
come
to
be
finally
exorcised.
if
i
may
touch
upon
the
jurisdictional
question;
frankly,
the
first
point
which
i
was
going
to
make
was
that
which
i
believe
came
out
in
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
brennan
and
my
learned
adversary.
the
ninth
circuit
has
quite
clearly
indicated
that
it
disagrees
with
the
position
of
judge
peckham.
it
indicated
that
in
several
decisions,
which
the
government
cites
in
its
brief,
prior
to
his
decision
and
at
least
one
decision
subsequent
thereto.
now,
the
question
was
asked.
why
didn't
the
government
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
that
is
the
cassidy
decision,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
it's
the
evans
decision,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
cited
on
page
37
of
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
--
and
in
some
place
in
our
brief.
the
question
before
this
court,
i
submit,
on
the
jurisdictional
point
is
whether
the
government
was
right
when
it
first
took
the
position
that
there
was
exclusive
and
mandatory
jurisdiction
in
this
court
or
whether
the
government
was
right
after
it
reconsidered
it
and
took
the
position
that
it
should
remand
and
have
a
go
at
the
ninth
circuit.
while,
of
course,
i
don't
deny
for
one
minute
that
the
department
of
justice
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
are
as
interested
in
the
administration
of
justice
as
those
of
us
in
the
defense
bar,
the
fact
is
that
one
cannot
overlook
the
fact
that
might
--
that
any
experienced
lawyer
would
recognize
the
inevitability
of
the
ninth
circuit
overruling
judge
peckham
and
i
could
not
believe
that
the
government
was
unaware
of
that.
if
the
question
is
asked
as
to
why
this
case
was
brought
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
first
place,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
appendix
c
to
the
government's
brief
which
is
a
letter
written
by
the
distinguished
former
director
of
the
selective
service
system,
general
louise
b.
hershey,
addressed
to
the
attorney
general.
this
is
reprinted
at
pages
74
and
75
of
the
government's
brief.
general
hershey
takes
the
view
“the
effect
of
this
decision,
if
allowed
to
stand
unchallenged,
would
be
to
place
an
intolerable
burden
upon
the
administration
of
the
selective
service
system
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
and
if
extended
to
other
jurisdictions
would
result
in
constructive
paralysis
of
the
selective
service
system
in
the
performance
of
its
mission
of
procurement
of
manpower
for
the
department
of
defense.”
then,
it
cites
various
decisions,
including
the
ninth
circuit.
and
then
states
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
enacting
and
re-enacting
the
selective
service
laws
during
the
past
29
years
have
been
well-aware
of
those
provisions
of
the
selective
service
regulations
which
discourage
the
presence
of
legal
counsel
for
registrants.
then
finally,
“i
am,
therefore,
making
this
formal
request
on
you
under
the
authority
given
to
me
in
the
statute
to
proceed
as
expeditiously
as
possible
and
asking
for
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.”
now
may
it
please
the
court,
as
i
read
all
of
the
opinions
in
the
sisson
case
and
in
the
mersky
case
and
in
the
blue
case
and
in
all
of
the
other
cases,
and
grapple
with
the
same
problems
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
grapples
with,
one
thing
i
think
comes
clear,
and
that
is
that
it
was
the
--
it
is
the
philosophy
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
where
there
are
truly
vital
important
constitutional
questions
in
criminal
cases,
that
the
path
should
be
smooth
for
their
being
resolved
by
the
supreme
court
immediately
and
without
the
intermediate
step
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
and,
i
suggest
that
where
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
think
that
the
sisson
case,
mr.
justice
white,
went
off
on
a
number
of
other
problems.
obviously,
the
man
appeared
before
the
jury
and
there
was
jeopardy
in
that
case,
but
it
seems
that
where
the
man
who
has
been
heading
the
selective
service
system
for
30
years
virtually
screams
to
high
heaven
that
the
system
is
going
to
be
destroyed
and
begs
the
attorney
general
to
take
the
case
directly
to
this
court,
that
whether
he
is
right
or
wrong,
and
of
course
we
say
that
he's
wrong
on
the
merits,
that
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
which
congress
had
in
mind
in
declaring
as
a
philosophy
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
major
constitutional
decisions
will
come
to
this
court
directly.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
government's
motion
to
remand,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
i
have
before
me
is
dated
december
1969.
the
date
is
crossed
out
and
it's
stamped
january
1970.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
if
there
is,
i'm
not
aware
of
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
practical
consideration,
of
course,
is
that
which
was
revealed
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
springer
that
if
the
government
succeeds
on
its
jurisdictional
point,
the
case
will
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
clearly
foreshadowed
by
the
evans
case
and
others.
and
then,
of
course,
the
probability
is
that
we
will
be
back
here
again,
but
this
time
we
will
be
back
as
supplicants,
as
petitioners
for
certiorari
rather
than
as
parties
with
a
legal
right
to
a
decision
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
marshall,
our
position
is
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment
did
indeed
occur,
and
our
position
is
that
there
was
in
fact
an
induction
refusal
as
indeed
is
not
contested
and
is
really
contested
in
conscientious
objector
cases.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
do
indeed,
but
it
was
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
if
i
can
go
back
to
my
understanding
of
the
position
taken
by
the
dissenters
in
the
mersky
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
spoke
for
the
traditional
view
of
the
motion
at
bar
provision
and
likened
it
to
either
the
specific
ancient
pleas,
if
i'm
not
being
prejudicial
in
using
that
word,
the
specific
venerable
pleas
such
as
the
statute
of
limitations,
(inaudible)
convict,
pardon,
and
suggested
that
it
has
to
be
something
which
is
of
the
nature
of
confession
and
avoidance.
now,
i
suggest
that
confession
and
avoidance,
as
i've
always
understood
it
as
a
matter
of
pleading
whether
it's
common
law
pleading
or
modern
pleading,
is
that
you
admit
the
acts
of
the
indictment,
but
you
say
that
there
is
something
else
which
gives
you
a
legal
right
to
be
exonerated,
notwithstanding
the
admission
of
the
acts
of
the
indictment.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
marshall.
may
i
also
point
out
that
the
indictment
itself
refers
to
all
of
the
selective
service
regulations
or
at
least
to
the
applicable
selective
service
regulations
as
being
part
of
the
crime
which
is
--
of
which
the
defendant
is
accused.
and,
the
indictment
specifically
specifies
the
whole
body
of
regulations,
including
the
regulations
governing
the
rights
to
personal
appearance
in
the
absence
of
counsel
thereat.
of
course,
under
the
view
of
motion
in
bar
which
was
taken
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
mersky
case,
we
should
confine
the
medieval
pleading
notions
to
the
dusty
bookshelves,
if
i
recall
the
adjectives
correctly,
and
that
a
motion
in
bar
exists
where
there
is
a
termination
of
the
cause
and
an
exculpation
of
the
defendant
and,
of
course,
that
clearly
occurred
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
judge
decided
that
the
regulation
was
not
authorized
by
the
statute
in
the
first
instance.
in
the
second
instance,
he
decided
that
the
regulation
in
any
event
could
not
have
been
authorized,
that
it
was
beyond
constitutional
power
because
of
the
nature
of
this
type
of
a
hearing.
and,
in
either
case,
there
was
a
major
decision
concerning
unconstitutionality
of
a
vital
part
of
the
selective
service
administration.
i
would
take
the
position
that
all
of
the
scholarly
and
interesting
discussion
in
sisson
really
does
not
take
our
case
any
further
than
it
was
before,
i
say
with
respect.
i
think
that
we
are
exactly
the
same
situation
which
mr.
justice
harlan
projected
in
the
blue
case
where
the
question
is
do
we
apply
the
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
standard
of
the
mersky
case
or
do
we
apply
the
standard
of
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
other
dissenters
in
the
mersky
case
and
that
under
any
standard
whether
it's
the
anything
which
exculpate
standard
or
the
confession
and
avoidance
standard
that
just
as
blue
made
it
to
the
supreme
court
directly,
it
had
a
right
to
in
that
case,
weller
should
have
a
right
to
make
it
directly
to
the
supreme
court
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suppose,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
we
would
probably
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
direct
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
my
friend
is
showing
me
the
statute,
yes.
well,
i
believe
something
similar
to
this
happened
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
fix
which
is
cited
without
very
much
discussion
in
the
government's
brief,
and
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case,
recognizing
the
dilemma,
certified
the
question
directly
to
this
court.
now,
so
much
for
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
expressed
its
uncertainty
about
that
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
other
aspect
of
the
jurisdictional
point
concerns
statutory
construction.
now,
here,
i
believe
that
we
rest
firmly
with
the
majority
opinion
in
mersky.
mersky
is
clear,
as
i
see
it,
that
where
a
regulation
is
so
closely
linked
or
so
closely
coupled
or
associated
with
the
statute
that
the
validity
of
one
must
of
course
be
determinative
of
the
validity
of
the
other,
that
what
the
court
has
done
in
dismissing
the
indictment
based
upon
a
construction
of
such
a
statute-cum-regulation
brings
it
within
the
statutory
construction
language
of
3731.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
absolutely
silent,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
think
it
very
much
is
a
construction
of
the
statute,
but
i
believe
that
the
district
judge
went
further
than
that.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
as
i
see
what
the
district
judge
did,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
he
looked
to
the
provisions
of
the
statute
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but,
he
did
find
that
the
statute
directed
the
president
to
select
them
for
military
service
in
a
fair
and
impartial
manner.
he
did
find
that
the
statute
direct
--
authorized
and
directed
the
president
to
set
up
a
network
of
local
boards
and
appeal
boards.
he
did
find
that
the
statute
authorized
and
directed
these
local
boards
to
make
--
to
hear
and
determine
all
questions
concerning
inclusions,
exemptions,
and
deference.
and,
he
did
specifically
find
that
the
statute
authorized
the
president
to
make
the
necessary
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
certainly
feel
that
the
district
judge
was
absolutely
correct
in
invoking
the
principle
of
greene
against
mcelroy
and
hannah
against
larche
and
many
other
decisions
of
this
court
to
find
that
wherever
something
gets
so
close
to
a
constitutional
right,
congress
must
act
explicitly.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
it
seemed
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me,
again,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
district
judge
was
looking
with
a
magnifying
glass
or
a
microscope
from
the
beginning
of
the
statute
to
the
end,
looking
through
every
clause
which
could
possibly
have
some
relationship
with
it
and
he
found
that
there
was
none.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
believe,
since
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
statute
properly
construed,
should
indicate
congressional
acquiescence
in
the
existing
pattern
of
denial
of
counsel
that
the
district,
and
since
i'm
sure
this
position
was
ably
urged
by
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
the
district
judge
had
to
examine
the
statute
and
to
see
it
should
be
construed
from
the
point
of
view
advocated
by
the
government.
i
guess,
perhaps,
there
may
be
some
uncertainty.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
you're
--
you
have
anticipated
my
next
observation
much
more
aptly,
mr.
justice
white.
i
was
going
to
say,
indeed,
that
to
suit
its
purposes
on
the
congressional
authorization
point,
the
government
tries
to
couple
or
link
the
statute
in
the
regulation
as
closely
together
as
possible.
indeed,
it
tries
to
fuse
them
together
with
the
best
welding
material
which
it
has,
but
for
purpose
of
meeting
its
jurisdictional
argument,
the
government
tries
to
separate
them,
and
this
leads
to
a
little
bit
of
schizophrenia
in
the
government's
brief
because
they
refer
--
at
one
place,
they
refer
to
the
statute
and
regulation
combined
as
the
law
of
selective
service.
it
obviously
suits
their
purpose
to
argue
that
this
is
the
law
of
selective
service
on
the
merits
while
it
doesn't
suit
their
purpose
to
do
so
on
the
jurisdictional
point.
i
think,
though,
that
the
final
point
on
jurisdiction
has
to
do
with
the
government's
concession,
as
it
must
concede
that
there
was
direct
jurisdiction
in
this
court
on
statutory
construction
of
the
eisdorfer
case.
the
government
argues
that
there
are
some
differences
between
eisdorfer
in
this
case
because
eisdorfer
involved
the
delinquency
regulations,
while
this
case
involves
a
regulation
prohibiting
counsel.
well,
i
--
the
government
says
that
there
is
this
difference,
but
doesn't
say
why
this
makes
a
difference.
it
argues
that
one
is
more
remote
than
another,
but
i
submit
that
the
delinquency
regulations,
as
anyone
who
has
read
the
oestereich
and
gutknecht
and
breen
decisions
of
this
court
knows,
involves
procedure
perhaps
even
more
so
than
it
involves
substance
and
the
regulation
involved
in
this
case
is
obviously
also
a
procedural
regulation.
now
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
certainly
was,
mr.
justice
harlan.
yes,
it
was
not
a
decision
of
this
court.
i'm
pointing
out
the
government
is
trying
to
explain
the
logic
in
its
position
and
i
believe
they
have
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do.
if
i
may
move
now
to
the
point
on
the
merits;
we
start
with
the
proposition
announced
by
this
court
in
greene
against
mcelroy,
and
foreshadowed
in
previous
decisions
and
followed
in
later
decisions
that
since
only
congress
can
draft,
only
congress
can
deny
the
right
of
counsel
as
part
of
the
drafting
process.
it
seems
that
this
is
self-evident
and
the
government
almost
admits
it,
except
for
one
place,
page
22
of
its
brief
where
it
seems
to
suggest
that
may
be
this
is
not
so
and
that
may
be
there
are
no
limits
on
presidential
power
to
deny
counsel
or
to
otherwise
structure
the
hearings.
and,
the
implication
perhaps
is
that
maybe
there
are
not
even
any
limits
on
other
presidential
war
powers,
a
point
which
the
government
tantalizingly
suggests
and
doesn't
move
on.
and
then,
once
again,
it
talks
about
non-jud
--
non-justiciability
and
to
my
surprise,
the
case
which
it
cited
is
an
order
of
this
court
denying
certiorari.
and,
of
course,
i
was
taught
from
my
first
breath
of
constitutional
law
that
one
should
never
see
a
denial
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
as
having
any
kind
of
significance
on
the
merits,
but
perhaps
when
--
perhaps
that's
the
best
thing
that
the
government
could
cite
for
this
preposition,
so
they
cited
it.
the
–
moore
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'm
referring,
mr.
justice
white,
to
the
government's
--
the
footnote
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief
where
moore
against
mcnamara,
an
order
of
this
court
denying
certiorari,
is
presumably
cited
in
favor
of
the
proposition
that
what
the
government
regards
as
non-justiciable
controversies
of
a
political
nature
should
not
properly
be
brought
before
the
court.
the
--
it
seems
that,
as
we
read
the
greene
case,
the
requirement
of
explicit
authorization
before
there
may
be
a
tampering
with
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
is
so
clear
that
it
is
hard
to
see
what
the
government
is
belaboring
except
that
one
must
identify
what
appears
to
be
a
complete
nimble
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
read
the
greene
case
to
stand
for
its
opposite.
the
government
seems
to
read
the
greene
case
as
saying
that
purposeful
inaction
means
the
same
thing
as
action,
but
it
seems
quite
clear
to
me,
from
anyone
who
reads
it,
that
the
greene
case
specifically
said
that
mere
acquiescence
or
inaction
is
sufficient
--
is
insufficient,
that
congress
must
specifically
authorize
a
departure
from
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
now,
the
government
mentions
hannah
against
larche,
which
was
of
course
the
decision
where
this
court
split
5-4
on
the
amount
of
due
process
which
was
available
to
witnesses
before
the
civil
rights
commission.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
in
hannah
against
larche
is
completely
different
from
that
which
we
have
here.
in
hannah
against
larche,
there
was
indeed
--
there
were
indeed
two
proposals
before
congress,
two
complete
proposals.
one
which
provided
for
a
greater
measure
of
due
process
and
another
which
provide
for
a
lesser
measure
of
due
process
and
both,
interestingly,
provided
for
rights
of
counsel,
though
to
different
extents.
and,
the
legislative
history
of
hannah
against
larche
is
clearly
revealed
by
the
majority
decision
of
this
court,
so
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
commission
indicated
that
congress
explicitly
selected
one
of
these
schemes
and
specifically
rejected
the
other
scheme.
the
argument
of
congressional
acquiescence,
was
not
followed
in
this
court
in
greene,
not
followed
in
this
court
in
2c,
a
selective
service
matter
though
not
involving
selective
service
administration
last
year
--
last
term.
the
government
finally
argues
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
1967
act.
it
appears
to
us
as
we
read
the
same
legislative
history
that
it
means
a
great
deal
other
than
what
the
government
says
it
means.
of
course,
there
were
extensive
hearings,
but
as
we
recall
and
as
the
court
may
well
take
judicial
notice,
these
hearings
were
essentially
about
student
defermance,
about
the
lottery,
about
occupational
defermance.
very
little
attention
was
given
to
selective
service
procedures,
very
little
attention
was
given
to
conscientious
objection.
the
government
argues
--
points
to
the
testimony
given
by
general
hershey
in
an
interim
report
which
was
prepared,
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
house
armed
services
committee
expressly
disclaimed
that
it
was
any
reflection
of
general
hershey's
views,
as
indeed
it
might
for
general
hershey
distinguished
himself
at
these
hearings
by
making
the
statement
that
he
was
opposed
to
any
amendments
to
the
law
because
“you
can
do
almost
anything
under
this
law
which
is
more
than
you
can
say
for
a
great
many
laws
that
are
on
the
books.
i
can
understand
the
house
armed
services
committee
wishing
to
disassociate
itself
with
that
sentiment.”
the
floor
debates
are
not
anymore
helpful.
my
learned
friend
is
wrong
when
he
says
that
there
was
a
debate
in
the
floor
of
the
house
concerning
counsel
at
local
boards.
the
proposal
made
by
congressman
castermire
was
exclusively
confined
to
appeal
boards.
there
was
no
discussion
at
all
on
the
floor
of
the
house
about
local
boards.
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
morse
amendment
was
entered
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
but
it
is
quite
clear
i
believe,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
senator
morse
who
raised
the
question
and
senator
russell,
the
chairman
of
the
senate
armed
services
committee,
and
other
senators
who
participated
in
the
debate
were,
and
i
must
say
this
with
all
respect,
acting
upon
complete
misinformation
as
to
what
was
involved.
we
indicate
the
colloquy
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
that
senator
russell,
as
the
chairman
of
the
senate
committee,
was
stating
quite
incorrectly
that
the
government
appeals
agent
is
independent
and
does
not
have
divided
loyalty,
and
stated
quite
clearly
that
there
is
a
--
that
there
are
separate
counsel
available
for
the
board
and
for
the
registrant.
now,
this
is
clearly
wrong.
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
in
the
long
footnote
on
page
35
a
number
of
other
places
where
they
were
just
clear
factual
error,
clear
misinformation
on
the
part
of
the
senators
engaged
in
this
debate.
now,
what
does
one
make
of
all
this?
i
suggest
that
this
is
an
apt
illustration
of
what
mr.
justice
charac
--
mr.
justice
jackson
characterized
the
floor
debates
as
“not
always
distinguished
for
candor
or
accuracy.”
the
--
and
perhaps,
illustrates
the
wisdom
of
the
doctrine
that
one
should
not
resort
to
legislative
history
except
where
the
face
of
the
act
is
inescapably
ambiguous,
but
here,
the
face
of
the
act
is
not
inescapably
ambiguous,
it
is
just
silent
on
the
subject.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
quite
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
but
at
the
very
least,
if
i
must
retreat
from
my
position,
though
i
don't
think
i'm
obliged
to,
it
seems
that
it
is
hardly
the
clear
showing
which
the
government
argues
is
clear
congressional
action.
i
do
not
think
that
that
occurred
in
this
case
by
a
long
shot,
and
i
think
that
the
government's
statements
about
legislative
history
will
--
should
be
and
indeed
will
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
actual
legislative
history
and
the
contentions
which
we
make.
the
essential
constitutional
point
which
we
make,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
a
local
board
personal
appearance
is
such
a
vital
and
necessary
part
of
the
procedure
whereby
young
persons
are
ordered
to
submit
themselves
to
the
demands
of
military
service
that
it
must
be
properly
reviewed
as
an
adjudicative
proceeding
and,
indeed,
as
this
word
has
been
used
in
many
court
decisions,
as
an
adversary
proceeding.
we
start
with
that
same
local
board
personal
appearance.
as
my
adversary
pointed
out,
this
is
a
formalized
part
of
the
structure.
indeed,
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
which
is
formal
within
the
structure.
it
is
a
means
of
contest.
it
is
an
arena
which
is
created
for
the
registrant
who
was
dissatisfied
with
this
classification
to
attempt
to
come
forth
and
secure
a
change
in
his
classification.
everything
else,
it
can
almost
be
stated
without
hazard,
is
by
supplication,
is
by
discretion
with
regard
to
selective
service.
this
is
one
of
the
few
guaranteed
rights
which
the
regulatory
scheme
sets
up,
the
right
to
contest
your
classification
and
to
have
a
personal
appearance
for
the
purpose
of
contesting
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
--
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i
must
observe
that,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief,
there
are
about
half-a-dozen
decisions
of
judges
who
have
indicated
great
discomfort
with
the
denial
of
counsel
and
quite
clearly
indicated
how
it
produces
injustice
in
many
cases.
i
have
referred
to
many
decisions
by
district
judges
and
a
few
decisions
by
courts
of
appeals.
the
--
it
is
by
its
nature
an
adversary
proceeding
because
if
one
need
not
go
further,
then
recall
the
language
of
justice
brandeis
in
the
abilene
railroad
case
which
we
quote
on
page
42
of
our
brief
that
even
in
a
case
where
the
determination
must
be
made
as
to
which
of
two
carriers
would
get
a
more
favorable
rate,
“every
proceeding
is
adversary
in
substance
if
it
may
result
in
an
order
in
favor
of
one
carrier
as
against
another,”
obviously
in
favor
or
one
registrant
as
against
another.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
two
ways
of
responding
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
one
can
indeed
say
that
the
local
board
and
the
power
which
it
represents
is
adversary
to
the
young
man.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
because,
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
are
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
is
a
difference
between
the
administrative
process
and
the
judicial
process.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
can't,
but
i
would
--
i
can't
and
i
wouldn't.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
what
i'm
suggesting,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
that,
as
viewed
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
abilene
railroad
case,
that
is
only
one
way
of
determining
whether
something
is
adversary
or
not,
that
whether
a
choice
must
be
made
between
two
contestants
as
to
who
gets
the
benefit
and
who
gets
the
burden,
that
that
is
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
contestant
in
the
sense
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suggest
that
the
contestant
is
any
other
young
man
who
may
get
that
particular
deferment
and
any
other
young
man
who
may
be
called
if
that
deferment
is
granted.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
at
the
time
the
--
if
the
rule
for
which
we
are
contending
is
adopted
then
at
the
time
that
he
receives
his
i-a
classification,
preliminary
to
report
for
induction,
he
will
have
an
opportunity
to
have
a
personal
appearance
and
to
indicate
the
grounds
for
his
contest
and
to
have
the
opportunity
for
a
meaningful
hearing.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'm
saying
that
the
philosophy
of
it,
as
i
read
the
abilene
case,
is
that
wherever
a
benefit
may
be
bestowed
upon
one
person
rather
than
another,
that
even
if
that
person
is
not
before
the
tribunal,
he
is
in
an
adversary
posture.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
would
not
appear
to
have
been
when
it
was
drafted
in
1940
and
the
regulations
that
we
have
are
still
the
harbingers
from
the
1940
statute,
but
a
great
deal
has
happened
in
the
evolution
of
standards
of
administrative
due
process
as
a
result
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts
since
then.
and,
this
also
answers
why
there
had
been
a
large
number
of
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
decisions,
all
of
which
we
seek
to
distinguish
in
our
brief,
particularly
in
the
early
days
which
almost
stated
as
an
ipse
dixit,
that
of
course,
there
is
no
right
to
counsel,
who
would
ever
think
of
it?
but,
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
goldberg
against
kelley
and
in
re
gault
and
in
a
number
of
other
decisions
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
emerging
recognition
of
the
fact
that
whenever
any
person's
private
or
property
rights
may
be
subjected
to
any
deprivation,
may
be
subjected
to
any
loss,
may
have
any
baleful
effect
upon
them,
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
--
to
a
meaningful
hearing
and
that
an
essence
of
a
meaningful
hearing
is
the
right
to
be
heard
and
the
right
to
be
heard
with
counsel.
and,
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessary
to
rehearse
the
catalog
of
decisions
where
that
has
been
held.
the
--
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
long
--
a
discussion
of
various
possible
classifications,
various
possible
classifications
which
the
local
board
may
give
and
we
indicate
in
each
one
of
them,
there
are
questions
of
law,
as
well
as
questions
of
fact
which
must
be
decided.
take,
for
example,
conscientious
objection.
local
board
must
decide
if
someone
is
a
i-o
or
a
i-a.
a
local
board
must
decide
whether
someone
is
a
religious
or
ethical
or
moral
objector
within
the
context
of
the
seeger,
sicurella
and
welsh
decisions,
or
whether
someone's
objection
is
based
on
policy,
pragmatism,
or
expediency
and
consequently
is
not
entitled
to
conscientious
objection.
the
local
board
must
decide
if
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
presented,
so
as
to
justify
reopening,
showing
that
also
as
a
question
of
law.
the
local
board
must
decide
if
there's
been
a
post
induction
maturation
of
conscientious
objector
views
raising
the
questions
that
are
before
this
court
in
the
ellort
case,
set
for
argument
i
believe
for
next
month.
the
local
board
must
decide
whether
there
has
been
a
good
--
whether
a
registrant's
statements
about
the
readiness
to
use
self-defense
come
within
the
exception
of
the
sicurella
case
or
whether
these
statements
indicated
general
objection
--
indicate
a
consistency
with
a
general
statement
of
conscientious
objection.
and,
of
course,
perforce
on
all
of
these
questions,
as
this
court
has
reminded
us
over
and
over
again
since
the
witmer
case,
a
board
must
decide
the
basic
question
of
sincerity.
now,
the
incidence
of
a
personal
appearance;
the
regulations
provide
for
the
administration
of
an
oath
for
the
subpoena
power.
words
like
evidence
and
hearing
and
jurisdiction
are
used.
the
regulations
bristle
with
these
characteristics
of
administrative
practice.
we
do
cite
in
the
brief
some
decisions
where
courts
have
recognized
the
adversary
character
of
selective
service
local
boards,
the
adjudicative
character
and
the
fact
that
the
things
which
they
do
affect
people's
personal
and
property
rights.
it's
a
sheer
fiction,
i
suggest.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
it's
a
creature
of
regulation,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don't
think
the
word
“personal
appearance”
appears
in
the
statute.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
guess
it's
not
the
first
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
and
also
it's
not
the
first
set
of
regulations
which
betray
inconsistencies.
on
the
one
hand,
the
regulation
talks
about
oaths
and
witnesses
and
adversaries
and
subpoenas
and
jurisdictions
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
regulation
says
no
counsel.
now,
this
does
indeed
take
us
to
the
special,
what
i
call,
the
special
mythology
of
selective
service.
we
had
a
little
project
in
my
office
this
summer.
with
the
assistance
of
a
number
of
law
students,
we
presume
to
read
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
governing
every
federal
administrative
agency
searching
for
similar
regulations
dealing
with
right
of
counsel,
and
our
findings
are
revealed
in
our
brief.
we
found
some
36
agencies
which
expressly
provided
for
the
right
of
counsel
either
by
statute
or
regulations.
we
did
not
find
a
single
other
agency
in
the
system
with
the
exception
of
the
selective
service
system,
where
either
by
statute
or
regulation,
there
was
an
express
prohibition
of
counsel
under
any
circumstances.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
to
be
some
better
argument
for
sustaining
this
“everybody
is
out
of
step
except
selective
service”
attitude
other
than
the
quaint
notion
that
it's
just
little
groups
of
neighbors
sitting
around
the
general
store
and
deciding
what's
best
for
neighbor
john's
son.
now,
the
fact
is
that
a
whole
series
of
cases
in
the
district
courts
and
one
in
this
court,
where
unfortunately,
certiorari
was
denied,
presented
very,
very
strong
proof
that
many
of
the
local
board
members
do
not
reside
in
their
districts.
and
the
response
by
the
selective
service
system
to
this
avalanche
of
cases
has
been
simply
to
amend
the
regulation,
to
rescind
the
regulation
requiring
local
board
members,
wherever
practicable,
to
reside
within
the
geographical
jurisdiction
of
their
boards.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh!
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
conceded
that,
i
certainly
never
intended
to
do
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no.
indeed,
it's
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
subject
to
the
constitution,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
selective
service
system
would
attempt
to
abolish
all
regulations
governing
procedures
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
about
personal
appearance,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
that
this
would
be
taking
away
the
right
to
be
heard.
it
will
be
taking
--
unless
something
is
substituted
which
is
the
equivalent
thereof,
it's
taking
something
--
the
only
thing
that,
seems
to
me,
equivalent
to
the
right
to
be
heard
with
counsel
is
the
right
to
be
heard
at
all.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
could
not,
in
truth
say
that
that
was
the
purpose
in
1940,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
purpose
in
1940
was
to
quickly
set
up
a
set
of
regulations
to
deal
with
a
total
national
mobilization
and
an
impending
emergency
problem,
and
that
nobody
really
thought
much
about
what
the
constitution
required.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
say
that
the
recognition
of
the
constitutional
compulsions
had
been
true
to
themselves
and
indeed,
with
each
term
of
this
court,
the
recognition
increases.
and,
i
would
hope
that
there
would
be
a
similar
increase
in
recognition
resulting
from
this
case.
may
i
just
point
out
finally
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
already
recognized
in
certain
aspects
of
conscientious
objector
cases.
it
is
recognized
by
the
military
in
all
of
the
in-service
procedures,
something
which
was
noted
by
judge
peckham
and
not
responded
to
by
the
government.
and,
it
was
recognized
for
a
period
of
20
years,
may
it
please
the
court,
under
the
old
hearings
held
before
the
department
of
justice
hearing
officers.
i
know,
i
participated
in
a
number
of
those
hearings
in
1965
and
1966
and
1967
and
indeed
it
is
clear
in
the
nugent
case
and
it
is
clear
in
the
four
decisions
by
this
court
in
1955
that
these
were
all
--
these
all
had
to
deal
with
the
proper
status
of
due
process
in
the
department
of
justice
hearings
where
it
was
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
right
of
counsel.
now,
finally,
in
response
to
the
cries
of
alarm
which
are
reflected
in
the
letter
by
general
hershey
in
the
record
and
reflected
rather
uncritically,
i
respectfully
suggest,
in
the
government's
brief
and
their
arguments
that
this
will
be
the
end
of
the
selective
service
system,
this
will
be
paralysis,
the
nation
will
be
left
defenseless
and
similar
hand
ringing.
i
think
it's
instructive
to
the
court
and,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
like
to
read
into
the
record
and
i'll
make
copies
available
through
the
clerk
of
a
recent
communication
by
the
present
national
director
of
the
selective
service
system.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
the
essence
of
it
is
one
sentence.
i've
advised
the
government
of
my
intention
to
read
this.
we
are
aware
of
course
of
cases
currently
before
the
supreme
court
which
deal
with
selective
conscientious
objection
and
representation
of
registrants
by
counsel.
it
is
our
hope
that,
should
changes
be
made
by
the
court
in
either
of
these
areas,
you
will
be
able
to
help
us
meet
the
resulting
challenges.
while
hardly
an
enthusiastic
endorsement
of
my
position,
it
is
quite
different
from
the
cry
that
the
selective
service
system
will
be
dismembered
if
this
court
decides
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
of
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
this
is
a
letter,
mr.
justice
stewart,
to
the
chairman
of
international
inter-religious
service
board
for
conscientious
objectors
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
--
copies
of
which
have
been
made
available
to
other
organizations.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
i
would
be
delighted
to
research
it
and
present
a
memorandum
to
the
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
can
say
for
sure
that
we
did
not
find
an
express
prohibition.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
selective
service
case
which
the
supreme
court
is
hearing
this
week.
unlike
gillette
and
negre,
which
were
argued
yesterday
however,
this
case
does
not
involve
cosmic
questions
of
the
definition
of
a
man's
conscience,
of
the
nature
of
his
religious
beliefs
the
character
of
conscientious
objection,
the
relationship
between
total
objection
and
selective
objection.
it
involves,
rather,
the
more
mundane,
but
no
less
you
pick
with
this
question
of
fairness
in
the
operation
of
the
selective
service
system.
the
administrative
agency
which
determines
which
man
shall
be
drafted
and
which
man
shall
not.
last
term,
this
court
was
deeply
divided
in
a
case
which
raised
the
question
of
the
proper
definition
of
conscientious
objection
and
the
relationship
between
the
religious
and
the
non-religious
objector,
i'm
referring,
of
course,
to
the
welsh
case.
but
this
court
was
unanimous
in
its
declaration
in
the
malloy
case
that
full
and
fair
administrative
review
is
indispensible
to
the
fair
operation
of
the
selective
service
system.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
the
backdrop
in
the
malloy
case,
as
is
likewise
the
backdrop
in
this
case,
is
the
extremely
limited
judicial
review
of
selective
service
administrative
decisions.
this
is
a
standard
of
judicial
review
which
this
court
has
declared
since
the
estep
case
in
1946
and
continues
to
reiterate
whenever
there
is
a
selective
case
before
it.
that
the
decisions
of
the
local
boards
and
the
appeal
boards
of
the
selective
service
system
must
be
approved
by
the
courts
even
if
they
are
erroneous
decisions
so
long
as
they
are
not
without
a
basis
in
fact.
i
submit
that
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
emergence
of
the
doctrine
that
the
selective
service
system
is
to
be
treated
like
any
other
administrative
agency
which
adjudicates
personal
and
property
rights
and
that
it
can
operate
fairly
unless
only
if
the
person
affected
has
the
right
to
a
meaningful
hearing
before
action
is
taken
which
affects
him.
and,
that
under
a
parade
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts,
there
is
no
meaningful
hearing
unless
the
person
who
was
subjected
to
these
sanctions
by
an
administrative
agency,
who
was
subjected
to
these
deprivations
and
effects
upon
his
personal
and
property
rights,
has
the
right
to
the
advice,
the
assistance,
and
the
presence
of
counsel
at
the
scene
of
such
hearing.
this
is
the
essence
of
the
decision
of
judge
peckham
below,
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
when
the
solicitor
general
states
that
judge
peckham's
decision
in
the
northern
district
of
california
was
based
only
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
regulation
was
authorized
by
statute.
the
same
words
which
judge
peckham
uses
to
declare
the
denial
of
counsel,
that
is
the
regulation
prohibiting
the
appearance
of
counsel
as
not
being
authorized
by
congress,
is
likewise
the
same
words
which
judge
peckham
uses
in
concluding
that
the
prohibition
of
counsel
is
without
constitutional
sanction.
i
may
say
finally,
in
terms
of
the
setting
of
this
case,
that
this
case
also
involves,
i
respectfully
submit,
the
exorcising
of
a
myth.
the
myth
that
selective
service
local
boards
are
not
administrative
tribunals
like
hundreds
or
thousands
of
other
administrative
tribunals
around
the
country,
federal
and
state,
but
some
kind
of
informal
(inaudible)
after-church
discussion
groups,
colloquially
called
little
groups
of
neighbors
and
that,
therefore,
they
should
not
be
held
to
the
same
standards
as
other
agencies
which
affect
personal
and
property
rights.
this
myth,
i
submit,
was
always
based
on
a
fiction,
but
the
myth
has
now
been
officially
disembodied
by
a
change
in
the
regulations
mentioned
in
our
brief,
which
i
will
get
to
later
in
my
argument,
and
the
time
has
long
come
to
be
finally
exorcised.
if
i
may
touch
upon
the
jurisdictional
question;
frankly,
the
first
point
which
i
was
going
to
make
was
that
which
i
believe
came
out
in
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
brennan
and
my
learned
adversary.
the
ninth
circuit
has
quite
clearly
indicated
that
it
disagrees
with
the
position
of
judge
peckham.
it
indicated
that
in
several
decisions,
which
the
government
cites
in
its
brief,
prior
to
his
decision
and
at
least
one
decision
subsequent
thereto.
now,
the
question
was
asked.
why
didn't
the
government
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
that
is
the
cassidy
decision,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
it's
the
evans
decision,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
cited
on
page
37
of
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
--
and
in
some
place
in
our
brief.
the
question
before
this
court,
i
submit,
on
the
jurisdictional
point
is
whether
the
government
was
right
when
it
first
took
the
position
that
there
was
exclusive
and
mandatory
jurisdiction
in
this
court
or
whether
the
government
was
right
after
it
reconsidered
it
and
took
the
position
that
it
should
remand
and
have
a
go
at
the
ninth
circuit.
while,
of
course,
i
don't
deny
for
one
minute
that
the
department
of
justice
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
are
as
interested
in
the
administration
of
justice
as
those
of
us
in
the
defense
bar,
the
fact
is
that
one
cannot
overlook
the
fact
that
might
--
that
any
experienced
lawyer
would
recognize
the
inevitability
of
the
ninth
circuit
overruling
judge
peckham
and
i
could
not
believe
that
the
government
was
unaware
of
that.
if
the
question
is
asked
as
to
why
this
case
was
brought
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
first
place,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
appendix
c
to
the
government's
brief
which
is
a
letter
written
by
the
distinguished
former
director
of
the
selective
service
system,
general
louise
b.
hershey,
addressed
to
the
attorney
general.
this
is
reprinted
at
pages
74
and
75
of
the
government's
brief.
general
hershey
takes
the
view
“the
effect
of
this
decision,
if
allowed
to
stand
unchallenged,
would
be
to
place
an
intolerable
burden
upon
the
administration
of
the
selective
service
system
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
and
if
extended
to
other
jurisdictions
would
result
in
constructive
paralysis
of
the
selective
service
system
in
the
performance
of
its
mission
of
procurement
of
manpower
for
the
department
of
defense.”
then,
it
cites
various
decisions,
including
the
ninth
circuit.
and
then
states
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
enacting
and
re-enacting
the
selective
service
laws
during
the
past
29
years
have
been
well-aware
of
those
provisions
of
the
selective
service
regulations
which
discourage
the
presence
of
legal
counsel
for
registrants.
then
finally,
“i
am,
therefore,
making
this
formal
request
on
you
under
the
authority
given
to
me
in
the
statute
to
proceed
as
expeditiously
as
possible
and
asking
for
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.”
now
may
it
please
the
court,
as
i
read
all
of
the
opinions
in
the
sisson
case
and
in
the
mersky
case
and
in
the
blue
case
and
in
all
of
the
other
cases,
and
grapple
with
the
same
problems
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
grapples
with,
one
thing
i
think
comes
clear,
and
that
is
that
it
was
the
--
it
is
the
philosophy
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
where
there
are
truly
vital
important
constitutional
questions
in
criminal
cases,
that
the
path
should
be
smooth
for
their
being
resolved
by
the
supreme
court
immediately
and
without
the
intermediate
step
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
and,
i
suggest
that
where
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
think
that
the
sisson
case,
mr.
justice
white,
went
off
on
a
number
of
other
problems.
obviously,
the
man
appeared
before
the
jury
and
there
was
jeopardy
in
that
case,
but
it
seems
that
where
the
man
who
has
been
heading
the
selective
service
system
for
30
years
virtually
screams
to
high
heaven
that
the
system
is
going
to
be
destroyed
and
begs
the
attorney
general
to
take
the
case
directly
to
this
court,
that
whether
he
is
right
or
wrong,
and
of
course
we
say
that
he's
wrong
on
the
merits,
that
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
which
congress
had
in
mind
in
declaring
as
a
philosophy
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
major
constitutional
decisions
will
come
to
this
court
directly.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
government's
motion
to
remand,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
i
have
before
me
is
dated
december
1969.
the
date
is
crossed
out
and
it's
stamped
january
1970.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
if
there
is,
i'm
not
aware
of
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
practical
consideration,
of
course,
is
that
which
was
revealed
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
springer
that
if
the
government
succeeds
on
its
jurisdictional
point,
the
case
will
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
clearly
foreshadowed
by
the
evans
case
and
others.
and
then,
of
course,
the
probability
is
that
we
will
be
back
here
again,
but
this
time
we
will
be
back
as
supplicants,
as
petitioners
for
certiorari
rather
than
as
parties
with
a
legal
right
to
a
decision
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
marshall,
our
position
is
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment
did
indeed
occur,
and
our
position
is
that
there
was
in
fact
an
induction
refusal
as
indeed
is
not
contested
and
is
really
contested
in
conscientious
objector
cases.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
do
indeed,
but
it
was
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
if
i
can
go
back
to
my
understanding
of
the
position
taken
by
the
dissenters
in
the
mersky
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
spoke
for
the
traditional
view
of
the
motion
at
bar
provision
and
likened
it
to
either
the
specific
ancient
pleas,
if
i'm
not
being
prejudicial
in
using
that
word,
the
specific
venerable
pleas
such
as
the
statute
of
limitations,
(inaudible)
convict,
pardon,
and
suggested
that
it
has
to
be
something
which
is
of
the
nature
of
confession
and
avoidance.
now,
i
suggest
that
confession
and
avoidance,
as
i've
always
understood
it
as
a
matter
of
pleading
whether
it's
common
law
pleading
or
modern
pleading,
is
that
you
admit
the
acts
of
the
indictment,
but
you
say
that
there
is
something
else
which
gives
you
a
legal
right
to
be
exonerated,
notwithstanding
the
admission
of
the
acts
of
the
indictment.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
marshall.
may
i
also
point
out
that
the
indictment
itself
refers
to
all
of
the
selective
service
regulations
or
at
least
to
the
applicable
selective
service
regulations
as
being
part
of
the
crime
which
is
--
of
which
the
defendant
is
accused.
and,
the
indictment
specifically
specifies
the
whole
body
of
regulations,
including
the
regulations
governing
the
rights
to
personal
appearance
in
the
absence
of
counsel
thereat.
of
course,
under
the
view
of
motion
in
bar
which
was
taken
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
mersky
case,
we
should
confine
the
medieval
pleading
notions
to
the
dusty
bookshelves,
if
i
recall
the
adjectives
correctly,
and
that
a
motion
in
bar
exists
where
there
is
a
termination
of
the
cause
and
an
exculpation
of
the
defendant
and,
of
course,
that
clearly
occurred
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
judge
decided
that
the
regulation
was
not
authorized
by
the
statute
in
the
first
instance.
in
the
second
instance,
he
decided
that
the
regulation
in
any
event
could
not
have
been
authorized,
that
it
was
beyond
constitutional
power
because
of
the
nature
of
this
type
of
a
hearing.
and,
in
either
case,
there
was
a
major
decision
concerning
unconstitutionality
of
a
vital
part
of
the
selective
service
administration.
i
would
take
the
position
that
all
of
the
scholarly
and
interesting
discussion
in
sisson
really
does
not
take
our
case
any
further
than
it
was
before,
i
say
with
respect.
i
think
that
we
are
exactly
the
same
situation
which
mr.
justice
harlan
projected
in
the
blue
case
where
the
question
is
do
we
apply
the
--
mr.
justice
brennan's
standard
of
the
mersky
case
or
do
we
apply
the
standard
of
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
other
dissenters
in
the
mersky
case
and
that
under
any
standard
whether
it's
the
anything
which
exculpate
standard
or
the
confession
and
avoidance
standard
that
just
as
blue
made
it
to
the
supreme
court
directly,
it
had
a
right
to
in
that
case,
weller
should
have
a
right
to
make
it
directly
to
the
supreme
court
in
this
case.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suppose,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
we
would
probably
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
direct
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
my
friend
is
showing
me
the
statute,
yes.
well,
i
believe
something
similar
to
this
happened
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
fix
which
is
cited
without
very
much
discussion
in
the
government's
brief,
and
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case,
recognizing
the
dilemma,
certified
the
question
directly
to
this
court.
now,
so
much
for
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
expressed
its
uncertainty
about
that
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
other
aspect
of
the
jurisdictional
point
concerns
statutory
construction.
now,
here,
i
believe
that
we
rest
firmly
with
the
majority
opinion
in
mersky.
mersky
is
clear,
as
i
see
it,
that
where
a
regulation
is
so
closely
linked
or
so
closely
coupled
or
associated
with
the
statute
that
the
validity
of
one
must
of
course
be
determinative
of
the
validity
of
the
other,
that
what
the
court
has
done
in
dismissing
the
indictment
based
upon
a
construction
of
such
a
statute-cum-regulation
brings
it
within
the
statutory
construction
language
of
3731.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
absolutely
silent,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
think
it
very
much
is
a
construction
of
the
statute,
but
i
believe
that
the
district
judge
went
further
than
that.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
as
i
see
what
the
district
judge
did,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
he
looked
to
the
provisions
of
the
statute
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but,
he
did
find
that
the
statute
directed
the
president
to
select
them
for
military
service
in
a
fair
and
impartial
manner.
he
did
find
that
the
statute
direct
--
authorized
and
directed
the
president
to
set
up
a
network
of
local
boards
and
appeal
boards.
he
did
find
that
the
statute
authorized
and
directed
these
local
boards
to
make
--
to
hear
and
determine
all
questions
concerning
inclusions,
exemptions,
and
deference.
and,
he
did
specifically
find
that
the
statute
authorized
the
president
to
make
the
necessary
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
certainly
feel
that
the
district
judge
was
absolutely
correct
in
invoking
the
principle
of
greene
against
mcelroy
and
hannah
against
larche
and
many
other
decisions
of
this
court
to
find
that
wherever
something
gets
so
close
to
a
constitutional
right,
congress
must
act
explicitly.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
it
seemed
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me,
again,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
district
judge
was
looking
with
a
magnifying
glass
or
a
microscope
from
the
beginning
of
the
statute
to
the
end,
looking
through
every
clause
which
could
possibly
have
some
relationship
with
it
and
he
found
that
there
was
none.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
believe,
since
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
statute
properly
construed,
should
indicate
congressional
acquiescence
in
the
existing
pattern
of
denial
of
counsel
that
the
district,
and
since
i'm
sure
this
position
was
ably
urged
by
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
the
district
judge
had
to
examine
the
statute
and
to
see
it
should
be
construed
from
the
point
of
view
advocated
by
the
government.
i
guess,
perhaps,
there
may
be
some
uncertainty.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
you're
--
you
have
anticipated
my
next
observation
much
more
aptly,
mr.
justice
white.
i
was
going
to
say,
indeed,
that
to
suit
its
purposes
on
the
congressional
authorization
point,
the
government
tries
to
couple
or
link
the
statute
in
the
regulation
as
closely
together
as
possible.
indeed,
it
tries
to
fuse
them
together
with
the
best
welding
material
which
it
has,
but
for
purpose
of
meeting
its
jurisdictional
argument,
the
government
tries
to
separate
them,
and
this
leads
to
a
little
bit
of
schizophrenia
in
the
government's
brief
because
they
refer
--
at
one
place,
they
refer
to
the
statute
and
regulation
combined
as
the
law
of
selective
service.
it
obviously
suits
their
purpose
to
argue
that
this
is
the
law
of
selective
service
on
the
merits
while
it
doesn't
suit
their
purpose
to
do
so
on
the
jurisdictional
point.
i
think,
though,
that
the
final
point
on
jurisdiction
has
to
do
with
the
government's
concession,
as
it
must
concede
that
there
was
direct
jurisdiction
in
this
court
on
statutory
construction
of
the
eisdorfer
case.
the
government
argues
that
there
are
some
differences
between
eisdorfer
in
this
case
because
eisdorfer
involved
the
delinquency
regulations,
while
this
case
involves
a
regulation
prohibiting
counsel.
well,
i
--
the
government
says
that
there
is
this
difference,
but
doesn't
say
why
this
makes
a
difference.
it
argues
that
one
is
more
remote
than
another,
but
i
submit
that
the
delinquency
regulations,
as
anyone
who
has
read
the
oestereich
and
gutknecht
and
breen
decisions
of
this
court
knows,
involves
procedure
perhaps
even
more
so
than
it
involves
substance
and
the
regulation
involved
in
this
case
is
obviously
also
a
procedural
regulation.
now
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
certainly
was,
mr.
justice
harlan.
yes,
it
was
not
a
decision
of
this
court.
i'm
pointing
out
the
government
is
trying
to
explain
the
logic
in
its
position
and
i
believe
they
have
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do.
if
i
may
move
now
to
the
point
on
the
merits;
we
start
with
the
proposition
announced
by
this
court
in
greene
against
mcelroy,
and
foreshadowed
in
previous
decisions
and
followed
in
later
decisions
that
since
only
congress
can
draft,
only
congress
can
deny
the
right
of
counsel
as
part
of
the
drafting
process.
it
seems
that
this
is
self-evident
and
the
government
almost
admits
it,
except
for
one
place,
page
22
of
its
brief
where
it
seems
to
suggest
that
may
be
this
is
not
so
and
that
may
be
there
are
no
limits
on
presidential
power
to
deny
counsel
or
to
otherwise
structure
the
hearings.
and,
the
implication
perhaps
is
that
maybe
there
are
not
even
any
limits
on
other
presidential
war
powers,
a
point
which
the
government
tantalizingly
suggests
and
doesn't
move
on.
and
then,
once
again,
it
talks
about
non-jud
--
non-justiciability
and
to
my
surprise,
the
case
which
it
cited
is
an
order
of
this
court
denying
certiorari.
and,
of
course,
i
was
taught
from
my
first
breath
of
constitutional
law
that
one
should
never
see
a
denial
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
as
having
any
kind
of
significance
on
the
merits,
but
perhaps
when
--
perhaps
that's
the
best
thing
that
the
government
could
cite
for
this
preposition,
so
they
cited
it.
the
–
moore
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'm
referring,
mr.
justice
white,
to
the
government's
--
the
footnote
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief
where
moore
against
mcnamara,
an
order
of
this
court
denying
certiorari,
is
presumably
cited
in
favor
of
the
proposition
that
what
the
government
regards
as
non-justiciable
controversies
of
a
political
nature
should
not
properly
be
brought
before
the
court.
the
--
it
seems
that,
as
we
read
the
greene
case,
the
requirement
of
explicit
authorization
before
there
may
be
a
tampering
with
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
is
so
clear
that
it
is
hard
to
see
what
the
government
is
belaboring
except
that
one
must
identify
what
appears
to
be
a
complete
nimble
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
read
the
greene
case
to
stand
for
its
opposite.
the
government
seems
to
read
the
greene
case
as
saying
that
purposeful
inaction
means
the
same
thing
as
action,
but
it
seems
quite
clear
to
me,
from
anyone
who
reads
it,
that
the
greene
case
specifically
said
that
mere
acquiescence
or
inaction
is
sufficient
--
is
insufficient,
that
congress
must
specifically
authorize
a
departure
from
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
now,
the
government
mentions
hannah
against
larche,
which
was
of
course
the
decision
where
this
court
split
5-4
on
the
amount
of
due
process
which
was
available
to
witnesses
before
the
civil
rights
commission.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
in
hannah
against
larche
is
completely
different
from
that
which
we
have
here.
in
hannah
against
larche,
there
was
indeed
--
there
were
indeed
two
proposals
before
congress,
two
complete
proposals.
one
which
provided
for
a
greater
measure
of
due
process
and
another
which
provide
for
a
lesser
measure
of
due
process
and
both,
interestingly,
provided
for
rights
of
counsel,
though
to
different
extents.
and,
the
legislative
history
of
hannah
against
larche
is
clearly
revealed
by
the
majority
decision
of
this
court,
so
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
commission
indicated
that
congress
explicitly
selected
one
of
these
schemes
and
specifically
rejected
the
other
scheme.
the
argument
of
congressional
acquiescence,
was
not
followed
in
this
court
in
greene,
not
followed
in
this
court
in
2c,
a
selective
service
matter
though
not
involving
selective
service
administration
last
year
--
last
term.
the
government
finally
argues
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
1967
act.
it
appears
to
us
as
we
read
the
same
legislative
history
that
it
means
a
great
deal
other
than
what
the
government
says
it
means.
of
course,
there
were
extensive
hearings,
but
as
we
recall
and
as
the
court
may
well
take
judicial
notice,
these
hearings
were
essentially
about
student
defermance,
about
the
lottery,
about
occupational
defermance.
very
little
attention
was
given
to
selective
service
procedures,
very
little
attention
was
given
to
conscientious
objection.
the
government
argues
--
points
to
the
testimony
given
by
general
hershey
in
an
interim
report
which
was
prepared,
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
house
armed
services
committee
expressly
disclaimed
that
it
was
any
reflection
of
general
hershey's
views,
as
indeed
it
might
for
general
hershey
distinguished
himself
at
these
hearings
by
making
the
statement
that
he
was
opposed
to
any
amendments
to
the
law
because
“you
can
do
almost
anything
under
this
law
which
is
more
than
you
can
say
for
a
great
many
laws
that
are
on
the
books.
i
can
understand
the
house
armed
services
committee
wishing
to
disassociate
itself
with
that
sentiment.”
the
floor
debates
are
not
anymore
helpful.
my
learned
friend
is
wrong
when
he
says
that
there
was
a
debate
in
the
floor
of
the
house
concerning
counsel
at
local
boards.
the
proposal
made
by
congressman
castermire
was
exclusively
confined
to
appeal
boards.
there
was
no
discussion
at
all
on
the
floor
of
the
house
about
local
boards.
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
morse
amendment
was
entered
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
but
it
is
quite
clear
i
believe,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
senator
morse
who
raised
the
question
and
senator
russell,
the
chairman
of
the
senate
armed
services
committee,
and
other
senators
who
participated
in
the
debate
were,
and
i
must
say
this
with
all
respect,
acting
upon
complete
misinformation
as
to
what
was
involved.
we
indicate
the
colloquy
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
that
senator
russell,
as
the
chairman
of
the
senate
committee,
was
stating
quite
incorrectly
that
the
government
appeals
agent
is
independent
and
does
not
have
divided
loyalty,
and
stated
quite
clearly
that
there
is
a
--
that
there
are
separate
counsel
available
for
the
board
and
for
the
registrant.
now,
this
is
clearly
wrong.
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
in
the
long
footnote
on
page
35
a
number
of
other
places
where
they
were
just
clear
factual
error,
clear
misinformation
on
the
part
of
the
senators
engaged
in
this
debate.
now,
what
does
one
make
of
all
this?
i
suggest
that
this
is
an
apt
illustration
of
what
mr.
justice
charac
--
mr.
justice
jackson
characterized
the
floor
debates
as
“not
always
distinguished
for
candor
or
accuracy.”
the
--
and
perhaps,
illustrates
the
wisdom
of
the
doctrine
that
one
should
not
resort
to
legislative
history
except
where
the
face
of
the
act
is
inescapably
ambiguous,
but
here,
the
face
of
the
act
is
not
inescapably
ambiguous,
it
is
just
silent
on
the
subject.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
quite
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
but
at
the
very
least,
if
i
must
retreat
from
my
position,
though
i
don't
think
i'm
obliged
to,
it
seems
that
it
is
hardly
the
clear
showing
which
the
government
argues
is
clear
congressional
action.
i
do
not
think
that
that
occurred
in
this
case
by
a
long
shot,
and
i
think
that
the
government's
statements
about
legislative
history
will
--
should
be
and
indeed
will
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
actual
legislative
history
and
the
contentions
which
we
make.
the
essential
constitutional
point
which
we
make,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
a
local
board
personal
appearance
is
such
a
vital
and
necessary
part
of
the
procedure
whereby
young
persons
are
ordered
to
submit
themselves
to
the
demands
of
military
service
that
it
must
be
properly
reviewed
as
an
adjudicative
proceeding
and,
indeed,
as
this
word
has
been
used
in
many
court
decisions,
as
an
adversary
proceeding.
we
start
with
that
same
local
board
personal
appearance.
as
my
adversary
pointed
out,
this
is
a
formalized
part
of
the
structure.
indeed,
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
which
is
formal
within
the
structure.
it
is
a
means
of
contest.
it
is
an
arena
which
is
created
for
the
registrant
who
was
dissatisfied
with
this
classification
to
attempt
to
come
forth
and
secure
a
change
in
his
classification.
everything
else,
it
can
almost
be
stated
without
hazard,
is
by
supplication,
is
by
discretion
with
regard
to
selective
service.
this
is
one
of
the
few
guaranteed
rights
which
the
regulatory
scheme
sets
up,
the
right
to
contest
your
classification
and
to
have
a
personal
appearance
for
the
purpose
of
contesting
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
--
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i
must
observe
that,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief,
there
are
about
half-a-dozen
decisions
of
judges
who
have
indicated
great
discomfort
with
the
denial
of
counsel
and
quite
clearly
indicated
how
it
produces
injustice
in
many
cases.
i
have
referred
to
many
decisions
by
district
judges
and
a
few
decisions
by
courts
of
appeals.
the
--
it
is
by
its
nature
an
adversary
proceeding
because
if
one
need
not
go
further,
then
recall
the
language
of
justice
brandeis
in
the
abilene
railroad
case
which
we
quote
on
page
42
of
our
brief
that
even
in
a
case
where
the
determination
must
be
made
as
to
which
of
two
carriers
would
get
a
more
favorable
rate,
“every
proceeding
is
adversary
in
substance
if
it
may
result
in
an
order
in
favor
of
one
carrier
as
against
another,”
obviously
in
favor
or
one
registrant
as
against
another.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
two
ways
of
responding
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
one
can
indeed
say
that
the
local
board
and
the
power
which
it
represents
is
adversary
to
the
young
man.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
because,
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
are
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
is
a
difference
between
the
administrative
process
and
the
judicial
process.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
can't,
but
i
would
--
i
can't
and
i
wouldn't.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
what
i'm
suggesting,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
that,
as
viewed
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
abilene
railroad
case,
that
is
only
one
way
of
determining
whether
something
is
adversary
or
not,
that
whether
a
choice
must
be
made
between
two
contestants
as
to
who
gets
the
benefit
and
who
gets
the
burden,
that
that
is
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
contestant
in
the
sense
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suggest
that
the
contestant
is
any
other
young
man
who
may
get
that
particular
deferment
and
any
other
young
man
who
may
be
called
if
that
deferment
is
granted.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
at
the
time
the
--
if
the
rule
for
which
we
are
contending
is
adopted
then
at
the
time
that
he
receives
his
i-a
classification,
preliminary
to
report
for
induction,
he
will
have
an
opportunity
to
have
a
personal
appearance
and
to
indicate
the
grounds
for
his
contest
and
to
have
the
opportunity
for
a
meaningful
hearing.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'm
saying
that
the
philosophy
of
it,
as
i
read
the
abilene
case,
is
that
wherever
a
benefit
may
be
bestowed
upon
one
person
rather
than
another,
that
even
if
that
person
is
not
before
the
tribunal,
he
is
in
an
adversary
posture.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
would
not
appear
to
have
been
when
it
was
drafted
in
1940
and
the
regulations
that
we
have
are
still
the
harbingers
from
the
1940
statute,
but
a
great
deal
has
happened
in
the
evolution
of
standards
of
administrative
due
process
as
a
result
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts
since
then.
and,
this
also
answers
why
there
had
been
a
large
number
of
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
decisions,
all
of
which
we
seek
to
distinguish
in
our
brief,
particularly
in
the
early
days
which
almost
stated
as
an
ipse
dixit,
that
of
course,
there
is
no
right
to
counsel,
who
would
ever
think
of
it?
but,
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
goldberg
against
kelley
and
in
re
gault
and
in
a
number
of
other
decisions
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
emerging
recognition
of
the
fact
that
whenever
any
person's
private
or
property
rights
may
be
subjected
to
any
deprivation,
may
be
subjected
to
any
loss,
may
have
any
baleful
effect
upon
them,
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
--
to
a
meaningful
hearing
and
that
an
essence
of
a
meaningful
hearing
is
the
right
to
be
heard
and
the
right
to
be
heard
with
counsel.
and,
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessary
to
rehearse
the
catalog
of
decisions
where
that
has
been
held.
the
--
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
long
--
a
discussion
of
various
possible
classifications,
various
possible
classifications
which
the
local
board
may
give
and
we
indicate
in
each
one
of
them,
there
are
questions
of
law,
as
well
as
questions
of
fact
which
must
be
decided.
take,
for
example,
conscientious
objection.
local
board
must
decide
if
someone
is
a
i-o
or
a
i-a.
a
local
board
must
decide
whether
someone
is
a
religious
or
ethical
or
moral
objector
within
the
context
of
the
seeger,
sicurella
and
welsh
decisions,
or
whether
someone's
objection
is
based
on
policy,
pragmatism,
or
expediency
and
consequently
is
not
entitled
to
conscientious
objection.
the
local
board
must
decide
if
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
presented,
so
as
to
justify
reopening,
showing
that
also
as
a
question
of
law.
the
local
board
must
decide
if
there's
been
a
post
induction
maturation
of
conscientious
objector
views
raising
the
questions
that
are
before
this
court
in
the
ellort
case,
set
for
argument
i
believe
for
next
month.
the
local
board
must
decide
whether
there
has
been
a
good
--
whether
a
registrant's
statements
about
the
readiness
to
use
self-defense
come
within
the
exception
of
the
sicurella
case
or
whether
these
statements
indicated
general
objection
--
indicate
a
consistency
with
a
general
statement
of
conscientious
objection.
and,
of
course,
perforce
on
all
of
these
questions,
as
this
court
has
reminded
us
over
and
over
again
since
the
witmer
case,
a
board
must
decide
the
basic
question
of
sincerity.
now,
the
incidence
of
a
personal
appearance;
the
regulations
provide
for
the
administration
of
an
oath
for
the
subpoena
power.
words
like
evidence
and
hearing
and
jurisdiction
are
used.
the
regulations
bristle
with
these
characteristics
of
administrative
practice.
we
do
cite
in
the
brief
some
decisions
where
courts
have
recognized
the
adversary
character
of
selective
service
local
boards,
the
adjudicative
character
and
the
fact
that
the
things
which
they
do
affect
people's
personal
and
property
rights.
it's
a
sheer
fiction,
i
suggest.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
it's
a
creature
of
regulation,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don't
think
the
word
“personal
appearance”
appears
in
the
statute.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
guess
it's
not
the
first
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
and
also
it's
not
the
first
set
of
regulations
which
betray
inconsistencies.
on
the
one
hand,
the
regulation
talks
about
oaths
and
witnesses
and
adversaries
and
subpoenas
and
jurisdictions
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
regulation
says
no
counsel.
now,
this
does
indeed
take
us
to
the
special,
what
i
call,
the
special
mythology
of
selective
service.
we
had
a
little
project
in
my
office
this
summer.
with
the
assistance
of
a
number
of
law
students,
we
presume
to
read
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
governing
every
federal
administrative
agency
searching
for
similar
regulations
dealing
with
right
of
counsel,
and
our
findings
are
revealed
in
our
brief.
we
found
some
36
agencies
which
expressly
provided
for
the
right
of
counsel
either
by
statute
or
regulations.
we
did
not
find
a
single
other
agency
in
the
system
with
the
exception
of
the
selective
service
system,
where
either
by
statute
or
regulation,
there
was
an
express
prohibition
of
counsel
under
any
circumstances.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
to
be
some
better
argument
for
sustaining
this
“everybody
is
out
of
step
except
selective
service”
attitude
other
than
the
quaint
notion
that
it's
just
little
groups
of
neighbors
sitting
around
the
general
store
and
deciding
what's
best
for
neighbor
john's
son.
now,
the
fact
is
that
a
whole
series
of
cases
in
the
district
courts
and
one
in
this
court,
where
unfortunately,
certiorari
was
denied,
presented
very,
very
strong
proof
that
many
of
the
local
board
members
do
not
reside
in
their
districts.
and
the
response
by
the
selective
service
system
to
this
avalanche
of
cases
has
been
simply
to
amend
the
regulation,
to
rescind
the
regulation
requiring
local
board
members,
wherever
practicable,
to
reside
within
the
geographical
jurisdiction
of
their
boards.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh!
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
conceded
that,
i
certainly
never
intended
to
do
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no.
indeed,
it's
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
subject
to
the
constitution,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
selective
service
system
would
attempt
to
abolish
all
regulations
governing
procedures
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
about
personal
appearance,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
that
this
would
be
taking
away
the
right
to
be
heard.
it
will
be
taking
--
unless
something
is
substituted
which
is
the
equivalent
thereof,
it's
taking
something
--
the
only
thing
that,
seems
to
me,
equivalent
to
the
right
to
be
heard
with
counsel
is
the
right
to
be
heard
at
all.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
could
not,
in
truth
say
that
that
was
the
purpose
in
1940,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
purpose
in
1940
was
to
quickly
set
up
a
set
of
regulations
to
deal
with
a
total
national
mobilization
and
an
impending
emergency
problem,
and
that
nobody
really
thought
much
about
what
the
constitution
required.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
say
that
the
recognition
of
the
constitutional
compulsions
had
been
true
to
themselves
and
indeed,
with
each
term
of
this
court,
the
recognition
increases.
and,
i
would
hope
that
there
would
be
a
similar
increase
in
recognition
resulting
from
this
case.
may
i
just
point
out
finally
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
already
recognized
in
certain
aspects
of
conscientious
objector
cases.
it
is
recognized
by
the
military
in
all
of
the
in-service
procedures,
something
which
was
noted
by
judge
peckham
and
not
responded
to
by
the
government.
and,
it
was
recognized
for
a
period
of
20
years,
may
it
please
the
court,
under
the
old
hearings
held
before
the
department
of
justice
hearing
officers.
i
know,
i
participated
in
a
number
of
those
hearings
in
1965
and
1966
and
1967
and
indeed
it
is
clear
in
the
nugent
case
and
it
is
clear
in
the
four
decisions
by
this
court
in
1955
that
these
were
all
--
these
all
had
to
deal
with
the
proper
status
of
due
process
in
the
department
of
justice
hearings
where
it
was
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
right
of
counsel.
now,
finally,
in
response
to
the
cries
of
alarm
which
are
reflected
in
the
letter
by
general
hershey
in
the
record
and
reflected
rather
uncritically,
i
respectfully
suggest,
in
the
government's
brief
and
their
arguments
that
this
will
be
the
end
of
the
selective
service
system,
this
will
be
paralysis,
the
nation
will
be
left
defenseless
and
similar
hand
ringing.
i
think
it's
instructive
to
the
court
and,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
like
to
read
into
the
record
and
i'll
make
copies
available
through
the
clerk
of
a
recent
communication
by
the
present
national
director
of
the
selective
service
system.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
the
essence
of
it
is
one
sentence.
i've
advised
the
government
of
my
intention
to
read
this.
we
are
aware
of
course
of
cases
currently
before
the
supreme
court
which
deal
with
selective
conscientious
objection
and
representation
