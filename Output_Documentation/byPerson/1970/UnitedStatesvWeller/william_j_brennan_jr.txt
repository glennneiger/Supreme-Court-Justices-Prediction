justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
springer,
we
would
give
him
a
rather
welcome
use
to
which
fact
something
was
being
done
by
the
congress
for
the
criminal
appeals
act.
where
does
that
stand,
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
may
happen
within
next
week
or
so
we
hope?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
won't
have
to
suffer
with
it
much
longer
if
something
is
passed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
hope
we
don't
get
the
same
new
problems
with
the
same
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
a
protected
appeal
pending?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
transfer
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
springer.
i
gather,
your
position
is
that
it's
not
under
that
first
paragraph
because
the
decision
was
not
based
upon
the
invalidity
of
the
construction
of
a
statute.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
the
second
one,
that
this
is
not
a
motion
at
bar,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
mean
that
it's
not
a
motion
at
bar,
not
that
it's
not
a
motion
at
bar
when
the
defendant
--
that
it
is
a
motion
at
bar,
but
not
one
when
the
defendant
is
not
to
put
to
jeopardy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
simpler
that
it's
not
a
motion
in
both.
that's
the
difference
--

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
springer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
each
state
set
up
to
some
legal
representation
before
the
selective
services?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
there
were
always
lawyers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
boards
get
their
legal
advice
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
board
to
have
a
lawyer
assigned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
springer,
did
you
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
already
taken
a
view
contrary
to
judge
peckham?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
if
we
say
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
it
goes
to
the
ninth
circuit
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
what
the
result
is
going
to
be
then?
