there
is
discretion
of
the
board
as
i
understand,
to
allow
someone
else
to
appear
for
the
registrant?
justice
byron

white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
provision
excluding
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
proviso
means
then
that,
although
the
board
may
permit
any
person
to
appear
before
them
on
behalf
of
the
registrant,
it
can't
be
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
couldn't
be
acting
on
behalf
of
the
registrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
customary
matter,
of
course,
couldn't
they
just
bring
someone
with
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can
be
done
and
it
could
be
a
lawyer,
as
long
as
he
just
sit
as
a
friend.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
publication
of
these
regulations
or
anything,
an
explanation
for
the
exclusions
of
legal
representation
from
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
in
sisson?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
understand
correctly
that
here
the
statute
was
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
counsel
could
or
couldn't
be
provided
by
the
executive?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
regulation
expressly
says
that
he
may
not
have
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
district
judge
says
there's
some
rule
of
law,
which
in
this
context,
which
means
that
a
silent
statute
just
doesn't
authorize
the
regulation.
now
is
that
a
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
because
he
read
it
and
said
it
was
silent,
that's
a
construction
or
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
found
them
silent?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
what
--
that
isn't
why
the
regulation
wasn't
authorized?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
construing
the
statute.
that's
just
saying
that
there's
a
principle
about
regulations,
that
some
are
good
and
some
are
bad
depending
on
how
close
they
are
to
constitutional
issues,
and
unless
the
statute
expressly
authorizes
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
a
district
judge
reads
a
decision
of
this
court
which
says
that
any
regulation
which
denies
counsel
must
at
least
have
express
congressional
authorization.
he
looks
at
the
statute,
he
doesn't
find
any
authorization,
and
he
says
the
regulation
is
invalid.
now,
is
that
a
construction
of
the
statute
or
is
it
basing
his
decision
on
a
decision
of
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
government
is
either
--
is
arguing
both
sides
of
the
road
when
it
says
that
it's
--
the
statute
is
silent
on
the
one
hand,
but
it
isn't
silent
on
the
other
because
of
congressional
acquiescence?
justice

the
case?
