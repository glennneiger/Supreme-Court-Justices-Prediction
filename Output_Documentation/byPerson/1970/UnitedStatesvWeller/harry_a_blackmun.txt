justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
springer,
what
is
the
reason
for
your
deep
concern
about
this?
if
it
went
to
the
ninth
circuit,
would
it
be
here
anyway
in
due
course?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
government
is
in
the
peculiar
position
of
having
brought
it
here
and
then
wishing
it
hadn't,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
karpatkin,
suppose
the
government
had,
however,
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
what
would
have
been
your
avenue
for
relief,
a
way
of
getting
here,
where
would
you
be,
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
you
would
interpret
8-3731
to,
where
it
says
an
appeal
may
be
taken
in
the
mandatory
language
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
the
--
is
that
analogy
by
certification,
certainly
distinct
from
any
concern
that
3731
was
mandatory?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
karpatkin,
it's
your
footnote
46
i
think
which
your
law
student
task
force
review
these
various
agencies
and
prohibition
of
counsel
or
the
absence
of
prohibition
provisions.
do
you
know
anything
about
these
agricultural
review
committees
which
have
some
parallel
anyway
to
the
local
board,
their
duty
being
to
determine
how
much
acreage
should
go
into
the
soil
bank,
this
kind
of
thing?
do
you
know
whether
there
is
a
prohibition
of
the
appearance
of
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
isn't
necessary.
i
just
noticed
it
was
listed
here
and
i
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright.
