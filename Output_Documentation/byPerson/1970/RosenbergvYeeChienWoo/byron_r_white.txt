justice

white
what
--
how
does
he
choose
if
the
quota
is
over
subscribed,
first-come-first-serve?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
suggestion
is
that
--
and
i
take
it
this
court
is
too
small
to
expand
the
statute
to
include
people
who
can
stay
somewhere
else,
who
resettle
some
place
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
you’re
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
emergencies
in
the
sense
for
people
who
haven’t
any
place
else
to
go,
who
can’t
stay
any
place
else?
justice

other
countries
won’t
take
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
countries
won’t
take
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
position
is
pretty
well
on
the
teeth
of
that
language
of
the
statute,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
only
admit
them
when
the
statute
from
countries
other
than
the
country
from
which
they
fled?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
nationals,
but
all
non-nationals
under
the
statute
could
be
admitted
under
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there’s
no
question
of
it
about
this
gentleman,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
fled
--
he
fled
and
he
is
not
a
national
of
the
country
from
which
he
made
application
for
entry
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
say,
your
position
takes
literal
construction?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
have
a
business
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
did
that
hong
kong
running
his
business,
raising
a
family,
20
years
and
you
would
have
the
same
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
interrupt
you?
pursuing
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
point,
what
is
the
--
what
is
hong
kong?
justice
byron

white
crown
colony
and
that
you
can’t
become
a
citizen
of
hong
kong,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
become
a
british
citizen?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
--
a
british
subject,
and
why
didn’t
congress
use
the
word
citizenship
or
citizen?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
permanent
resident
of
the
united
states?
is
he
a
national?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
but
i
say,
he
owes
allegiance
in
the
sense
that
he
has
to
serve
in
the
--
he
has
to
serve
the
armed
forces?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
wouldn’t
call
him
a
national?
justice
byron

white
because
you
just
define
national
as
a
citizen?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
now
i
just
wondered
that
what
about
that
in
this
case.
