mr.

on
the
respondent’s
theory,
does
refugee
status
once
acquired
continue
forever?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
incidentally,
now
that
i’ve
interrupted
you,
is
there
any
distinction
in
immigration
law
terminology
between
the
term
national
and
the
term
citizenship?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dale,
let
me
ask
of
you
the
comment
i
made
of
mr.
gordon.
on
your
theory,
is
a
man
once
a
refugee,
always
a
refugee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
do
i
take
it
that
you
do
coalesce
the
term
“national”
with
“citizenship?”
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dale,
a
little
while
ago,
i
think
you
were
about
to
say
something
about
quotas.
if
the
quotas
are
over
subscribed
and
he
is
here,
then
presumably,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
eligible
people
who
can’t
get
in.
were
you
going
to
say
something
about
quota?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
why
he
didn’t
come
here
originally
out
of
china?
