mr.
gordon
g.
dale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent’s
position
is
that
congress
knowingly
and
intelligently
used
the
term
“national”
in
excluding
would
be
refugees
under
this
section
203
(a)
(7).
and
we
say
where
an
applicant
qualifies
under
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
unless
he’s
become
a
national
of
intermediate
country,
he
is
eligible
for
consideration
under
the
law.
so
when
respondent
harry
woo
fled
from
red
china
and
he
went
to
hong
kong
and
he
open
up
his
one
desk
business
of
getting
orders
in
the
united
states
for
clothing
and
he
was
able
to
live
in
an
apartment
of
one
room,
with
his
$3.00
hong
kong
money
when
he
arrived
in
hong
kong,
and
was
able
to
make
a
sufficient
business
so
that
he
was
able
to
get
a
trip
to
united
states
as
a
business
visitor,
and
he
was
given
by
the
british
government
a
certificate
of
identity
and
that’s
all.
he
had
not
become
a
british
national.
he
is
eligible
under
the
act.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
that
is
basically
true
mr.
chief
justice,
except
that
a
certificate
of
identity
gives
one
no
assurance
of
its
continuance.
it
is
a
certificate
of
identity.
it
has
to
be
renewed
periodically.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
respondent’s
certificate
of
identity
expired
in
1967.
at
the
request
of
the
petitioner,
the
immigration
service,
he
was
directed
to
apply
for
renewal
of
the
certificate
of
identity.
he
did
so
and
was
informed
by
the
hong
kong
authorities;
he
must
apply
in
los
angeles
at
the
office
of
the
british
government
there,
the
british
consulate.
now,
the
british
consulate
said
we’re
not
interested.
your
application
has
to
be
made
in
hong
kong.
so
at
the
present
time,
harry
woo
has
a
three-year,
four-year-old
expired
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
legally
in
the
united
states
until
1966,
i
believe
on
a
series
of
extensions
granted
by
the
immigration
service.
now,
his
original
visit
in
1960
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
is
--
i
would
say
at
sufferance
since
1966,
but
he
had
a
lawful
extension
of
his
business
visitor’s
visa
each
year
from
1960
to
1965.
we
contend
that
congress
used
this
term
national
because
national
is
a
well
recognize
term
in
international
law.
we
used
that
term
in
our
nationality
act
of
1940.
we’ve
used
that
again
in
our
act
of
1952,
the
basic
immigration
act
under
which
we
now
operate.
certain
rights
and
obligations
go
with
nationality,
among
them
of
course
the
most
important,
military
service
to
the
country
of
which
you’re
a
nation,
and
in
turn,
the
nation
provides
the
national
with
some
protection
abroad.
for
example,
could
harry
woo,
the
respondent
expect
some
kind
of
protection
for
the
british
government
to
the
united
states?
not
at
all.
they
are
not
interested
in
him.
do
we
provide
protection
for
people
who
have
permanent
residence
in
united
states
if
they’re
visiting
abroad,
not
at
all.
we
have
enough
problems
with
our
own
citizens
abroad.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
justice
harlan?
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
alright.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
in
the
second
circuit,
the
court
stated
that
in
referring
to
the
fair
share
law
for
example,
the
fair
share
law
of
1960,
the
basic
refugee
act
at
that
time.
and
they
claim
that
this
statute
provided
the
necessary
understanding
for
the
1965
statute,
and
quoted
the
language
under
the
united
nations
high
commissioner
for
mandate
and
the
court
use
the
language,
this
particular
statute
which
used
the
term
“not
a
national”
only
applies
--
applies
only
to
those
refugees
who
do
not
have
the
right
and
obligations
of
nationals
in
the
country
in
which
they
reside.
and
the
court
immediately
picked
this
up
and
said
“it
might
seem
to
prove
the
ninth
circuit’s
position”
and
i
claim
exactly,
it
does
indeed.
but
then
the
court
makes
a
leap
back
into
legislative
history.
we
claim
that
legislative
history
has
no
part
in
this
case
where
the
language
is
absolutely
clear.
the
petitioner
would
have
us
completely
topsy-turvy
apply
the
statutory
construction
rule.
the
statute
is
plain.
but
if
you
delve
into
the
con
--
the
legislative
history
is
sufficiently
and
not
only
of
this
act,
but
the
1948
act,
the
1953
act,
the
1957
act,
the
1960
act,
the
1962
act,
i
assure
you,
you
can
find
sufficient
confusion
that
now
you
can
ignore
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
now,
you’re
in
the
position
to
look
and
decide
what
would
be
a
good
standard
to
apply,
and
that’s
exactly
what
the
petitioner
has
done
under
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
a
refugee
from
red
china.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
came
here
from
hong
kong.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
not
fleeing
hong
kong,
but
where
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
conceivably,
he
could
have
stayed
in
hong
kong
until
today.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
conceivably,
he
could
have
done
this.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
except
that
apparently,
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
getting
this
so
called
certificate
of
identity,
we
were
directed
to
obtain.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
if
he
had
this
document
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
that’s
correct.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
claim
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
contend
that
where
a
refugee
goes
out
of
red
china
into
hong
kong,
which
now
has
the
highest
population
of
any
area
in
the
world
where
two
million
of
the
people
or
four
million
are
refugees,
this
is
no
haven.
this
is
a
small
piece
of
ground
where
true
his
breathing
and
living.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that
belief
about
the
united
states
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
claim
his
refugee
status
did
not
terminate
merely
because
he
had
a
place
to
put
his
feet
in
hong
kong.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
claim
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
some
of
the
protections
that
the
congress
intended
by
using
the
term
“national.”
in
other
words,
some
protection
if
you’re
abroad
from
your
home
country.
the
right
for
example,
in
a
democratic
country
to
have
something
to
do
with
voting,
election
of
officers,
hold
office,
a
person
with
some
citizenship
rights,
not
just
somebody
who
barely
exists.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
say
the
man
was
barely
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
don’t
know
the
source
of
his
ability
to
make
that
trip
to
the
united
states.
i
do
know
the
purpose
was
to
get
orders
for
clothing
which
he
then
take
back
to
his
one
desk
and
parcel
out
to
people
to
make
the
clothing.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
your
honor.
i
can’t
deny
the
fact
he
got
to
united
states.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
but
i
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
if
he’s
become
a
national
of
intermediate
country
as
congress
said
in
the
statute,
he
is
not
qualified
any
longer
for
refugee
status.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
will
have
the
same
case
under
my
analysis,
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
fruitful
to
consider
the
specter
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
of
inundation
of
the
united
states
by
refugees
unless
he
his
standard
is
applied
and
the
congressional
standard
of
nationalist
at
ward.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
it’s
a
british
crown
colony.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
there’s
no
such
thing
as
citizenship
there.
as
i
understand,
you
become
a
british
national
if
great
britain
chooses
to
recognize
you.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
subject,
yes,
and
you
have
to
carry
a
british
passport.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
would
suppose
only
that
because
the
term
national
was
used
in
the
1952
basic
immigration
nationality
act
to
determine
--
to
describe
a
national
as
one
who
owes
permanent
allegiance,
and
it
was
used
again
in
the
1940
nationality
act.
so,
it’s
a
term
that
has
been
constantly
used
and
i
suppose
that’s
why
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
he’s
not.
permanent
resident
merely
has
a
right
to
reside.
he
has
certain
obligations
such
as
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
under
our
law,
he
has
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces;
that’s
correct.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he’s
not
a
national.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
correct.
i
think
under
our
law,
there
are
a
couple
of
island
areas
where
the
natives
are
nationals.
for
example,
before
the
philippine
independence
act,
all
the
philippine
were
nationals
of
the
united
states,
but
not
citizens.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
they’re
not
nationals
of
the
crown
colony
and
they
are
not
citizens.
they
have
a
certificate
of
identity
that
identifies
them
as
residing
in
hong
kong
which
can
be
lifted.
so
there’s
no
law
that
says
that
there’s
anything
that
guarantees
them,
anything
like
for
example,
permanent
residence
in
the
united
states.
if
you
have
a
permanent
residence
certificate
here,
so
long
as
you
do
not
become
subject
to
deportable
offense,
you
can
remain
here
permanently
and
the
law
says
you
can.
there’s
nothing
that
assured
for
a
person
who
lives
in
hong
kong
with
a
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
of
course
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
subscribe
to
the
government’s
contention
that
this
is
primarily
a
hardship
statute.
there’s
another
section
of
the
immigration
law
that
allows
parole
in
the
united
states
under
section
212,
parole
in
the
united
states
where
there’s
a
really
emergency.
you
can
be
assured
that
under
this
program
of
admission
to
the
united
states,
under
207,
there’s
a
long
careful
screening
of
each
applicant
who
seeks
to
come
in
under
this
statute
and
nobody
is
just
going
to
come
drifting
in
under
203
(a)
(7).
if
there’s
a
real
emergency,
section
212
i
believe
would
be
used
which
allows
the
attorney
general
to
certainly
parole
people
in
the
united
states.
this
is
really
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes,
i
agree.
that
was
the
intention
your
honor.
but
of
course,
i
contend
that
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
--
and
that
a
man
in
the
position
of
respondent
is
in
a
hardship
situation
contemplated
by
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
had
not
at
the
time
that
he’d
left,
no.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
point
that
we
have
made
that
the
1951
convention
on
the
status
refugees,
the
signatories
agree
that
they
will
not
expel
of
compel
refugees
who
come
into
their
territory
to
go
back
to
the
country
from
whence
their
life
or
freedom
might
be
threatened.
but
when
the
united
kingdom
exceeded
to
the
treaty,
it
had
the
option
to
include
all
the
territories
whose
foreign
affairs
that
was
responsible,
but
the
united
kingdom
chose
to
exclude
hong
kong
from
this
agreement.
they
did
the
same
thing
with
the
1968
protocol,
doubtlessly
had
good
reasons.
like
china
not
impose
certain
conditions
under
retention
of
the
crown
colony
and
say
we
want
some
of
those
nationals
returned.
but
the
united
kingdom
didn’t
want
that
treaty
restricting
their
freedom
and
they
wouldn’t
agree
that
hong
kong
was
included.
does
that
sound
like
a
certificate
of
identity
holder
like
the
respondent?
could
be
assure
that
he
had
a
nice
safe
haven
in
hong
kong?
we
claim
no.
we
claim
that
this
refugee
true
had
a
place
to
stay,
but
it
was
a
very
tenuous
location
indeed,
and
congress
contemplated
that
this
was
a
hazardous
situation
and
said
when
you’re
a
national,
then,
you’re
disqualified.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
would
claim
he
was
within
the
reach
of
the
strict
construction
of
the
statute
as
passed
by
congress,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
we
might
look
to
the
protocol
to
which
united
states
has
subscribed.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
if
he
can
return
to
red
china
which
is
become
a
democracy
and
he’s,
then
no
longer
in
fear
of
persecution
because
of
his
race
or
religion
or
political
opinion,
by
know
means,
he
can
no
longer
claim
refugee
status.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
again,
it’s
a
difference
between
the
protection
that
is
given
to
a
national,
by
his
home
country.
he’s
standing
in
that
country
as
suppose
to
the
mere
temporary
status
of
one
who
is
at
sufferance
in
an
intermediate
country.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
your
honor.
he
had
no
--
he
had
nothing
as
substantial
as
permanent
residence
in
united
states
where
you
have
a
card
that
says
this
man
is
got
a
right
to
permanent
residence.
all
he
has
to
is
file
an
address
report
card
once
a
year.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
there
seven
--
almost
seven
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
contend
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
something
over
10
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
don’t
think
we
could
contend
that
he
had
a
sure
permanent
residence
here
despite
the
10
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
want
to
quote
from
the
1969
visa
office
report
on
the
numbers
who
have
applied
and
been
accepted
under
the
statute.
according
to
that
report,
in
1966,
3,991
were
admitted
out
of
allowed
quota
of
10,200.
in
1967,
4,337;
1968,
6,325;
1969,
9,850;
so
that
in
none
of
the
four
years
reported
has
the
entire
quota
have
been
used
and
i
think
it’s
interesting
that
and
one
of
the
immigration
reports
referred
to
by
mr.
gordon,
there
is
a
record
of
denials
of
applicants
who
sought
to
come
in
and
they
denied
them
on
the
basis
that
they
were
firmly
resettled.
and
the
total
number
of
denials
for
the
whole
year
1967
was
82.
so,
i
think
it’s
unrealistic
to
imagine
that
we
are
going
to
be
an
inundated
with
refugees
either
applying
abroad
or
applying
here
under
the
statute.
the
facts
just
aren’t
that
way.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes,
it
does.
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
hong
kong,
according
to
the
applications
that
were
before
the
service
and
were
considered
by
the
district
court,
he
indicated
he
tried
to
come
to
united
states
and
was
told
do
you
have
a
sponsor
there
and
he
just
told
no,
i
don’t
have
a
sponsor.
do
you
have
a
guarantee
job?
i
don’t
even
know
anybody
there.
well,
you
can’t
go.
so,
forget
it.
then,
he
made
applications
to
go
to
other
countries,
apparently
just
before,
he
again
applied
to
come
to
the
united
states.
he
was
told
he
could
to
indonesia
as
a
refugee
and
about
the
same
time,
he
then
was
told
there’s
a
great
program
going
on
against
chinese
in
indonesia,
so
he
didn’t
go
there.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
don’t
see
that
this
is
an
absolute
rule,
but
the
odd
thing
is
that
the
petitioner
admits
that
they’ve
decided
every
single
refugee
case
from
1948,
1953,
1956,
1960,
1962
and
this
act
as
if
the
language
had
never
changed,
all
of
them
are
turned
down
in
the
opinion
of
the
immigration
officer
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
of
course,
we
have
a
novel
position
of
arguing
for
strict
construction
to
statute
which
we
did
in
our
client.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
there
is
a
provision
under
the
act
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
10.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
your
honor,
there
is.
there
is
a
provision
under
the
deportation
law
that
allows
what’s
called
suspension
from
deportation
if
he
resided
in
the
united
states
for
in
excess
of
seven
years.
however,
the
instructions
have
gone
down
that
no
applications
will
be
approved
where
the
time
has
been
built
up
either
by
court
actions
or
by
private
bills
in
congress,
or
by
--
when
you
came
in
as
a
student
or
if
you
came
in
as
a
visitor,
or
indeed
if
you
came
in
a
legal
capacity.
apparently,
the
only
way
you
could
be
assured
that
the
seven-year
rule
might
apply
is
if
you
are
hiding
out
successfully
for
about
seven
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
private
bills
are
extremely
difficult
your
honor
because
you
have
to
have
a
congressman
who
is
terribly
eager
and
will
to
go
and
back
for
you
because
it
has
been
abused
in
the
past.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
first
filed
i
think
in
1965
for
the
refugee
application.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
1965.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
and
the
court
decision
was
in
1968
i
believe
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
our
favor
was
1969.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
oh,
i
just
think
the
second
circuit
is
wrong
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
just
think
the
second
circuit
is
wrong
your
honor.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
schwegmann
brothers
versus
calvert
distillers
corporation
where
the
writer
of
the
opinion
said
it’s
a
business
of
congress
to
sum
up
its
own
debates
and
its
legislation.
moreover,
it’s
only
the
words
of
the
bill
that
have
presidential
approval
where
that
approval
has
been
given.
it’s
not
to
be
supposed
that
in
signing
a
bill,
the
president
endorses
the
whole
congressional
record.
and
incidentally,
this
record
appearing
covers
some
1,500
pages
on
that
are
referred
to
by
the
petitioner.
for
us
to
undertake
to
reconstruct
an
enactment
from
legislative
history
is
merely
to
involved
the
court
in
political
controversies
which
are
quite
proper
in
the
enactment
of
the
bill
which
you
have
no
place
in
its
interpretation.
and
ending
by
and
large,
i
think
our
function
was
well
stated
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
we
do
not
inquire
what
the
legislature
meant.
we
ask
only
what
the
statute
means.
we
believe
that
on
the
basis
of
the
statute,
our
client,
the
respondent
qualified
under
the
statute
should
be
considered
and
should
therefore
be
eligible
for
such
a
visa,
and
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
for
the
ninth
circuit
be
affirmed.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
ninth
circuit,
i
did.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
i
did
not.
i
didn’t
--
i
wasn’t
even
aware
of
it.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent’s
position
is
that
congress
knowingly
and
intelligently
used
the
term
“national”
in
excluding
would
be
refugees
under
this
section
203
(a)
(7).
and
we
say
where
an
applicant
qualifies
under
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
unless
he’s
become
a
national
of
intermediate
country,
he
is
eligible
for
consideration
under
the
law.
so
when
respondent
harry
woo
fled
from
red
china
and
he
went
to
hong
kong
and
he
open
up
his
one
desk
business
of
getting
orders
in
the
united
states
for
clothing
and
he
was
able
to
live
in
an
apartment
of
one
room,
with
his
$3.00
hong
kong
money
when
he
arrived
in
hong
kong,
and
was
able
to
make
a
sufficient
business
so
that
he
was
able
to
get
a
trip
to
united
states
as
a
business
visitor,
and
he
was
given
by
the
british
government
a
certificate
of
identity
and
that’s
all.
he
had
not
become
a
british
national.
he
is
eligible
under
the
act.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
that
is
basically
true
mr.
chief
justice,
except
that
a
certificate
of
identity
gives
one
no
assurance
of
its
continuance.
it
is
a
certificate
of
identity.
it
has
to
be
renewed
periodically.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
respondent’s
certificate
of
identity
expired
in
1967.
at
the
request
of
the
petitioner,
the
immigration
service,
he
was
directed
to
apply
for
renewal
of
the
certificate
of
identity.
he
did
so
and
was
informed
by
the
hong
kong
authorities;
he
must
apply
in
los
angeles
at
the
office
of
the
british
government
there,
the
british
consulate.
now,
the
british
consulate
said
we’re
not
interested.
your
application
has
to
be
made
in
hong
kong.
so
at
the
present
time,
harry
woo
has
a
three-year,
four-year-old
expired
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
legally
in
the
united
states
until
1966,
i
believe
on
a
series
of
extensions
granted
by
the
immigration
service.
now,
his
original
visit
in
1960
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
is
--
i
would
say
at
sufferance
since
1966,
but
he
had
a
lawful
extension
of
his
business
visitor’s
visa
each
year
from
1960
to
1965.
we
contend
that
congress
used
this
term
national
because
national
is
a
well
recognize
term
in
international
law.
we
used
that
term
in
our
nationality
act
of
1940.
we’ve
used
that
again
in
our
act
of
1952,
the
basic
immigration
act
under
which
we
now
operate.
certain
rights
and
obligations
go
with
nationality,
among
them
of
course
the
most
important,
military
service
to
the
country
of
which
you’re
a
nation,
and
in
turn,
the
nation
provides
the
national
with
some
protection
abroad.
for
example,
could
harry
woo,
the
respondent
expect
some
kind
of
protection
for
the
british
government
to
the
united
states?
not
at
all.
they
are
not
interested
in
him.
do
we
provide
protection
for
people
who
have
permanent
residence
in
united
states
if
they’re
visiting
abroad,
not
at
all.
we
have
enough
problems
with
our
own
citizens
abroad.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
justice
harlan?
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
alright.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
in
the
second
circuit,
the
court
stated
that
in
referring
to
the
fair
share
law
for
example,
the
fair
share
law
of
1960,
the
basic
refugee
act
at
that
time.
and
they
claim
that
this
statute
provided
the
necessary
understanding
for
the
1965
statute,
and
quoted
the
language
under
the
united
nations
high
commissioner
for
mandate
and
the
court
use
the
language,
this
particular
statute
which
used
the
term
“not
a
national”
only
applies
--
applies
only
to
those
refugees
who
do
not
have
the
right
and
obligations
of
nationals
in
the
country
in
which
they
reside.
and
the
court
immediately
picked
this
up
and
said
“it
might
seem
to
prove
the
ninth
circuit’s
position”
and
i
claim
exactly,
it
does
indeed.
but
then
the
court
makes
a
leap
back
into
legislative
history.
we
claim
that
legislative
history
has
no
part
in
this
case
where
the
language
is
absolutely
clear.
the
petitioner
would
have
us
completely
topsy-turvy
apply
the
statutory
construction
rule.
the
statute
is
plain.
but
if
you
delve
into
the
con
--
the
legislative
history
is
sufficiently
and
not
only
of
this
act,
but
the
1948
act,
the
1953
act,
the
1957
act,
the
1960
act,
the
1962
act,
i
assure
you,
you
can
find
sufficient
confusion
that
now
you
can
ignore
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
now,
you’re
in
the
position
to
look
and
decide
what
would
be
a
good
standard
to
apply,
and
that’s
exactly
what
the
petitioner
has
done
under
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
a
refugee
from
red
china.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
came
here
from
hong
kong.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
not
fleeing
hong
kong,
but
where
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
conceivably,
he
could
have
stayed
in
hong
kong
until
today.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
conceivably,
he
could
have
done
this.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
except
that
apparently,
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
getting
this
so
called
certificate
of
identity,
we
were
directed
to
obtain.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
if
he
had
this
document
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
that’s
correct.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
claim
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
contend
that
where
a
refugee
goes
out
of
red
china
into
hong
kong,
which
now
has
the
highest
population
of
any
area
in
the
world
where
two
million
of
the
people
or
four
million
are
refugees,
this
is
no
haven.
this
is
a
small
piece
of
ground
where
true
his
breathing
and
living.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that
belief
about
the
united
states
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
claim
his
refugee
status
did
not
terminate
merely
because
he
had
a
place
to
put
his
feet
in
hong
kong.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
claim
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
some
of
the
protections
that
the
congress
intended
by
using
the
term
“national.”
in
other
words,
some
protection
if
you’re
abroad
from
your
home
country.
the
right
for
example,
in
a
democratic
country
to
have
something
to
do
with
voting,
election
of
officers,
hold
office,
a
person
with
some
citizenship
rights,
not
just
somebody
who
barely
exists.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
say
the
man
was
barely
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
don’t
know
the
source
of
his
ability
to
make
that
trip
to
the
united
states.
i
do
know
the
purpose
was
to
get
orders
for
clothing
which
he
then
take
back
to
his
one
desk
and
parcel
out
to
people
to
make
the
clothing.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
your
honor.
i
can’t
deny
the
fact
he
got
to
united
states.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
but
i
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
if
he’s
become
a
national
of
intermediate
country
as
congress
said
in
the
statute,
he
is
not
qualified
any
longer
for
refugee
status.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
will
have
the
same
case
under
my
analysis,
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
fruitful
to
consider
the
specter
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
of
inundation
of
the
united
states
by
refugees
unless
he
his
standard
is
applied
and
the
congressional
standard
of
nationalist
at
ward.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
it’s
a
british
crown
colony.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
there’s
no
such
thing
as
citizenship
there.
as
i
understand,
you
become
a
british
national
if
great
britain
chooses
to
recognize
you.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
subject,
yes,
and
you
have
to
carry
a
british
passport.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
would
suppose
only
that
because
the
term
national
was
used
in
the
1952
basic
immigration
nationality
act
to
determine
--
to
describe
a
national
as
one
who
owes
permanent
allegiance,
and
it
was
used
again
in
the
1940
nationality
act.
so,
it’s
a
term
that
has
been
constantly
used
and
i
suppose
that’s
why
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
he’s
not.
permanent
resident
merely
has
a
right
to
reside.
he
has
certain
obligations
such
as
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
under
our
law,
he
has
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces;
that’s
correct.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he’s
not
a
national.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
correct.
i
think
under
our
law,
there
are
a
couple
of
island
areas
where
the
natives
are
nationals.
for
example,
before
the
philippine
independence
act,
all
the
philippine
were
nationals
of
the
united
states,
but
not
citizens.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
they’re
not
nationals
of
the
crown
colony
and
they
are
not
citizens.
they
have
a
certificate
of
identity
that
identifies
them
as
residing
in
hong
kong
which
can
be
lifted.
so
there’s
no
law
that
says
that
there’s
anything
that
guarantees
them,
anything
like
for
example,
permanent
residence
in
the
united
states.
if
you
have
a
permanent
residence
certificate
here,
so
long
as
you
do
not
become
subject
to
deportable
offense,
you
can
remain
here
permanently
and
the
law
says
you
can.
there’s
nothing
that
assured
for
a
person
who
lives
in
hong
kong
with
a
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
of
course
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
subscribe
to
the
government’s
contention
that
this
is
primarily
a
hardship
statute.
there’s
another
section
of
the
immigration
law
that
allows
parole
in
the
united
states
under
section
212,
parole
in
the
united
states
where
there’s
a
really
emergency.
you
can
be
assured
that
under
this
program
of
admission
to
the
united
states,
under
207,
there’s
a
long
careful
screening
of
each
applicant
who
seeks
to
come
in
under
this
statute
and
nobody
is
just
going
to
come
drifting
in
under
203
(a)
(7).
if
there’s
a
real
emergency,
section
212
i
believe
would
be
used
which
allows
the
attorney
general
to
certainly
parole
people
in
the
united
states.
this
is
really
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes,
i
agree.
that
was
the
intention
your
honor.
but
of
course,
i
contend
that
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
--
and
that
a
man
in
the
position
of
respondent
is
in
a
hardship
situation
contemplated
by
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
had
not
at
the
time
that
he’d
left,
no.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
point
that
we
have
made
that
the
1951
convention
on
the
status
refugees,
the
signatories
agree
that
they
will
not
expel
of
compel
refugees
who
come
into
their
territory
to
go
back
to
the
country
from
whence
their
life
or
freedom
might
be
threatened.
but
when
the
united
kingdom
exceeded
to
the
treaty,
it
had
the
option
to
include
all
the
territories
whose
foreign
affairs
that
was
responsible,
but
the
united
kingdom
chose
to
exclude
hong
kong
from
this
agreement.
they
did
the
same
thing
with
the
1968
protocol,
doubtlessly
had
good
reasons.
like
china
not
impose
certain
conditions
under
retention
of
the
crown
colony
and
say
we
want
some
of
those
nationals
returned.
but
the
united
kingdom
didn’t
want
that
treaty
restricting
their
freedom
and
they
wouldn’t
agree
that
hong
kong
was
included.
does
that
sound
like
a
certificate
of
identity
holder
like
the
respondent?
could
be
assure
that
he
had
a
nice
safe
haven
in
hong
kong?
we
claim
no.
we
claim
that
this
refugee
true
had
a
place
to
stay,
but
it
was
a
very
tenuous
location
indeed,
and
congress
contemplated
that
this
was
a
hazardous
situation
and
said
when
you’re
a
national,
then,
you’re
disqualified.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
would
claim
he
was
within
the
reach
of
the
strict
construction
of
the
statute
as
passed
by
congress,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
we
might
look
to
the
protocol
to
which
united
states
has
subscribed.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
if
he
can
return
to
red
china
which
is
become
a
democracy
and
he’s,
then
no
longer
in
fear
of
persecution
because
of
his
race
or
religion
or
political
opinion,
by
know
means,
he
can
no
longer
claim
refugee
status.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
think
again,
it’s
a
difference
between
the
protection
that
is
given
to
a
national,
by
his
home
country.
he’s
standing
in
that
country
as
suppose
to
the
mere
temporary
status
of
one
who
is
at
sufferance
in
an
intermediate
country.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
your
honor.
he
had
no
--
he
had
nothing
as
substantial
as
permanent
residence
in
united
states
where
you
have
a
card
that
says
this
man
is
got
a
right
to
permanent
residence.
all
he
has
to
is
file
an
address
report
card
once
a
year.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
there
seven
--
almost
seven
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
he
was
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
contend
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
something
over
10
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
don’t
think
we
could
contend
that
he
had
a
sure
permanent
residence
here
despite
the
10
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
want
to
quote
from
the
1969
visa
office
report
on
the
numbers
who
have
applied
and
been
accepted
under
the
statute.
according
to
that
report,
in
1966,
3,991
were
admitted
out
of
allowed
quota
of
10,200.
in
1967,
4,337;
1968,
6,325;
1969,
9,850;
so
that
in
none
of
the
four
years
reported
has
the
entire
quota
have
been
used
and
i
think
it’s
interesting
that
and
one
of
the
immigration
reports
referred
to
by
mr.
gordon,
there
is
a
record
of
denials
of
applicants
who
sought
to
come
in
and
they
denied
them
on
the
basis
that
they
were
firmly
resettled.
and
the
total
number
of
denials
for
the
whole
year
1967
was
82.
so,
i
think
it’s
unrealistic
to
imagine
that
we
are
going
to
be
an
inundated
with
refugees
either
applying
abroad
or
applying
here
under
the
statute.
the
facts
just
aren’t
that
way.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes,
it
does.
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
hong
kong,
according
to
the
applications
that
were
before
the
service
and
were
considered
by
the
district
court,
he
indicated
he
tried
to
come
to
united
states
and
was
told
do
you
have
a
sponsor
there
and
he
just
told
no,
i
don’t
have
a
sponsor.
do
you
have
a
guarantee
job?
i
don’t
even
know
anybody
there.
well,
you
can’t
go.
so,
forget
it.
then,
he
made
applications
to
go
to
other
countries,
apparently
just
before,
he
again
applied
to
come
to
the
united
states.
he
was
told
he
could
to
indonesia
as
a
refugee
and
about
the
same
time,
he
then
was
told
there’s
a
great
program
going
on
against
chinese
in
indonesia,
so
he
didn’t
go
there.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
don’t
see
that
this
is
an
absolute
rule,
but
the
odd
thing
is
that
the
petitioner
admits
that
they’ve
decided
every
single
refugee
case
from
1948,
1953,
1956,
1960,
1962
and
this
act
as
if
the
language
had
never
changed,
all
of
them
are
turned
down
in
the
opinion
of
the
immigration
officer
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
of
course,
we
have
a
novel
position
of
arguing
for
strict
construction
to
statute
which
we
did
in
our
client.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
there
is
a
provision
under
the
act
--
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
10.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
yes
your
honor,
there
is.
there
is
a
provision
under
the
deportation
law
that
allows
what’s
called
suspension
from
deportation
if
he
resided
in
the
united
states
for
in
excess
of
seven
years.
however,
the
instructions
have
gone
down
that
no
applications
will
be
approved
where
the
time
has
been
built
up
either
by
court
actions
or
by
private
bills
in
congress,
or
by
--
when
you
came
in
as
a
student
or
if
you
came
in
as
a
visitor,
or
indeed
if
you
came
in
a
legal
capacity.
apparently,
the
only
way
you
could
be
assured
that
the
seven-year
rule
might
apply
is
if
you
are
hiding
out
successfully
for
about
seven
years.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
private
bills
are
extremely
difficult
your
honor
because
you
have
to
have
a
congressman
who
is
terribly
eager
and
will
to
go
and
back
for
you
because
it
has
been
abused
in
the
past.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
we
first
filed
i
think
in
1965
for
the
refugee
application.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
1965.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
and
the
court
decision
was
in
1968
i
believe
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
our
favor
was
1969.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
oh,
i
just
think
the
second
circuit
is
wrong
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
i
just
think
the
second
circuit
is
wrong
your
honor.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
schwegmann
brothers
versus
calvert
distillers
corporation
where
the
writer
of
the
opinion
said
it’s
a
business
of
congress
to
sum
up
its
own
debates
and
its
legislation.
moreover,
it’s
only
the
words
of
the
bill
that
have
presidential
approval
where
that
approval
has
been
given.
it’s
not
to
be
supposed
that
in
signing
a
bill,
the
president
endorses
the
whole
congressional
record.
and
incidentally,
this
record
appearing
covers
some
1,500
pages
on
that
are
referred
to
by
the
petitioner.
for
us
to
undertake
to
reconstruct
an
enactment
from
legislative
history
is
merely
to
involved
the
court
in
political
controversies
which
are
quite
proper
in
the
enactment
of
the
bill
which
you
have
no
place
in
its
interpretation.
and
ending
by
and
large,
i
think
our
function
was
well
stated
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
we
do
not
inquire
what
the
legislature
meant.
we
ask
only
what
the
statute
means.
we
believe
that
on
the
basis
of
the
statute,
our
client,
the
respondent
qualified
under
the
statute
should
be
considered
and
should
therefore
be
eligible
for
such
a
visa,
and
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
for
the
ninth
circuit
be
affirmed.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
ninth
circuit,
i
did.
mr.
gordon
g.
dale
no,
i
did
not.
i
didn’t
--
i
wasn’t
even
aware
of
it.
