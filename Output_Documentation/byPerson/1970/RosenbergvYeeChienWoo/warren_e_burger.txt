mr.
gordon,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
he
left
red
china,
communist
china,
did
he
take
his
wife
and
child
with
him
or
did
he
live
alone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
act
--
to
what
act
was
that
--
to
those
were
remarks
directed,
specifically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
act
were
they
debating
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
the
record
show
whether
he
is
still
maintaining
the
business
in
hong
kong?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
in
the
present
posture
for
some
reason
or
other,
hong
kong
said
that
he
had
only
30
days
to
clear
up
his
affairs
and
get
out,
how
would
that
affect
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
but
if
in
the
future.
assuming
you
prevailed
here
and
if
in
the
future,
he
was
so
informed
by
hong
kong
and
given
30
or
90
days
to
find
a
new
place,
would
he
then
resume
in
your
view
a
refugee,
a
homeless
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gordon.
mr.
dale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
the
status
of
--
as
justice
douglas
suggested
that
most
of
the
people
in
hong
kong
precisely
that
that
is
they
are
on
the
certificate
of
identity
which
has
the
much
the
same
function
as
a
passport
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
legally
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
lived
in
here
and
perhaps
a
better
way
to
put,
he
was
here
at
sufferance
very
definitely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dale,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
government’s
argument
that
this
statute,
this
whole
scheme
program
was
generously
conceived
to
take
care
of
hardship
cases,
if
you
agree
that
it
is
a
hardship
type
of
statute,
how
do
you
fit
to
see
your
--
the
respondent
into
the
hardship
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
not
agree
that
the
legislative
history
of
these
statutes,
of
this
particular
statute
demonstrates
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
giving
relief
to
oppressed
people,
refugees,
homeless
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then,
it’s
a
hardship
statute
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
had
he
every
had
any
indication
that
his
right
to
stay
in
hong
kong
would
be
terminated
by
the
british?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dale,
i
take
that
the
government’s
direction
to
this
man
to
apply
for
renewal
of
his
certificate
of
identity
in
hong
kong
through
hong
kong
was
a
not
a
gesture
or
a
futile
exercise
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
whether
he
could
be
reinstated
there.
and
if
he
could,
if
he
now
could
be
reinstated
in
his
former
position
in
hong
kong,
would
you
still
claim
his
--
within
the
reach
of
a
hardship
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

you
mr.
