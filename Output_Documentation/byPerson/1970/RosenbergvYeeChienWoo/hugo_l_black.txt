may
i
ask
you
if
you’re
familiar
with
the
immigration
laws.
is
there
any
other
method
by
which
a
man
can
be
permitted
to
come
in
here
by
any
government
agencies
under
circumstances
like
this
except
to
go
through
the
courts?
what
i
mean
is,
is
there
a
hard
and
fast,
rigid
rules
which
the
government
officers
are
under
oath
bound
to
obey
that
they
must
try
to
keep
this
man
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you’re
talking
now
about
the
rigid
application
of
the
law.
does
anybody
have
an
authority
in
the
immigration
department
all
the
way
up
to
the
president
to
make
a
suspension
in
cases
like
this
to
loosen
and
to
relieve
hardships?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
i
was
just
asking
you
for
your
information
about
the
others?
justice

pretty
bad
thing
to
have
a
case
like
this
here
before
us.
one
man
living,
he
was
living
in
hong
kong
as
far
i’m

into

that
i
have
a
place
to
live,
and
reside.
if
your
wife
doesn’t
buy
too
many
clothes,
but
it
is
a
delight
to
please
and
he
leaves.
of
course,
he
is
not
a
refugee
from
there,
strictly
speaking,
he
is
not
a
refugee
from
there.
he
is
a
refugee
from
the
other
place
and
has
found
place
to
like,
like
a
bird
in
the
song.
but
is
there
any
other
method?
we
have
so
many
of
these
cases
that
present
these
type
hardship
cases
and
this
is
a
hardship
case,
as
it
is
now.
whatever
maybe
said
about
the
law,
it's
a
hardship
case,
and
been
living

seven
years
isn’t
it?
