justice
thurgood
marshall
the
second
circuit
pulled
on
the
basis
that
the
man
had
to
actually
be
homeless?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wasn’t
homeless
he
can
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
with
the
second
circuit
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
respondent
had
given
up
their
connection
in
hong
kong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don’t
you
have
to
be
a
refugee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
from
which
--
from
what
country
is
mr.
woo
a
refugee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
did
he
come
here
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wasn't
fleeing
hong
kong,
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
stay
--
have
stayed
in
hong
kong
until
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
could
have
run
his
business
there
until
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far
as
you
and
i
know,
he
can
go
back
there
tomorrow.
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
was
obtained,
he
could
go
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
protect
somebody
from
being
sent
back
to
where
he
had
fled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
means
just
--
i
fail
to
see
how
he
gets
under
the
refugee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he’s
not
homeless;
he’s
homeless
now
because
he
gave
up
his
own.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don’t
we
agree,
you
and
i
that
there’s
no
country
in
the
world
quite
good
as
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
want
to
use
the
comparative
basis
now
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
is
not
a
refugee
from
hong
kong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
place
to
live,
marry,
raise
a
child
and
run
a
business
is
not
permanent
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
do
you
need
for
residence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
to
you
need
for
residence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
a
man
with
a
business
had
barely
existed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
a
man
that’s
got
a
business
and
got
enough
money
to
come
running
from
hong
kong
over
here
is
barely
existing
when
i
don’t
have
enough
money
to
get
from
here
to
hong
kong.
[laughter]
he
has
money
enough
to
get
from
hong
kong
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there’s
nothing
in
his
record
that
shows
that
he
was
a
corporal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assume
something
against
that,
that
a
red
china
became
a
democracy
next
year,
will
he
still
be
refugee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
he
still
be
a
refugee
under
this
act?
i
understood
you’d
answer
my
brother
white's
question
that
once
he
left
red
china,
he’s
a
refugee
forever.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
difference
insofar
as
hong
kong
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
claimed
he’s
a
temporary
resident
of
hong
kong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
was
he
there,
seven
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
lived
there
and
raised
a
family,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
was
just
temporarily
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
was
he
been
in
this
country?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he’s
three
years
more
permanent
here
than
hong
kong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
second
circuit
pulled
on
the
basis
that
the

had
to
actually
be
homeless?
justice
thurgood

and
he
wasn’t
homeless
he
can
--
justice
thurgood

not
with
the

--
justice
thurgood

did
respondent

justice
thurgood
