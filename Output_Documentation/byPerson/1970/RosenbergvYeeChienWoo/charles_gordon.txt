mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
an
alien
who
has
been
an
overstayed
temporary
visitor
in
the
united
states
since
1965,
claims
a
right
to
remain
under
a
statute
which
grants
special
benefits
to
refugees.
the
issue
concerns
the
construction
of
section
203
(a)
(7)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
affords
a
haven
for
refugees
who
have
been
--
who
are
fled
persecution
in
communist
countries,
who
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
return
and
who
are
not
nationals
of
the
country
or
area
in
which
their
application
is
made.
respondent
unquestionably
fled
communist
china
in
1953.
however,
like
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others,
his
flight
stopped
at
hong
kong
where
he
was
granted
generous
residence
privileges,
established
a
home,
was
married
and
had
a
child
and
continued
to
live
for
seven
years.
in
1959,
respondent
came
to
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
as
a
temporary
visitor
for
business.
he
stayed

months
and

in
1960,
the
respondent
again
came
to
the
united
states
as
a
business
visitor
and
left
his
wife
in
hong
kong
to
operate
the
family
business.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
left
alone
and
was
married
in

and
the
child
was
born
in

he
had
previously
been
married
in

his
wife
died
and
he
had

whom
he
left
there.
he
was
married

and

an
additional

in

after
his
coming
to
the
united
states
in
1960,
the
respondent
continued
to
remain
in
the
united
states.
his
wife
and
child
followed
him
to
the
united
states
in
1965,
also
entering
as
temporary
visitors.
the
temporary
stay
of
the
entire
family
expired
in
1965
and
they
continued
to
remain
here.
deportation
proceedings
were
brought
against
respondent
and
his
wife
and
a
deportation
order
was
entered
against
them
with
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
california.
immediately,
the
respondent
filed
an
application
for
benefits
under
a
proviso
to
section
203
(a)
(7)
which
grants
refugee
benefits
to
refugees
who
have
lived
in
this
country
for
two
years.
that
application
was
denied
by
the
immigration
and
district
director
by
the
regional
commissioner
on
the
ground
that
the
respondent
was
no
longer
a
refugee
since
he
had
established
--
firmly
established
a
residence
and
a
home
in
hong
kong.
he
then
sought
judicial
review.
the
district
court
ruled
in
his
favor,
finding
that
he
had
not
been
from
the
resettle
in
hong
kong
because
of
this
allegation
that
he
have
never
intended
to
remain
their
permanently
and
that
he
harbored
an
intention
to
come
to
the
united
states
at
all
times.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
they
found,
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
question
of
whether
he
was
firmly
resettled
was
irrelevant.
the
court
said
that
under
the
statute,
once
respondent
had
been
a
refugee,
he
was
entitled
to
its
benefits
even
though
he
had
established
a
stable
new
home
in
another
country.
this
con
--
mr.
charles
gordon
it
had
and
in
a
moment,
i
shall
--
mr.
charles
gordon
--
develop
that.
that
conclusion
incidentally
is
opposed
by
the
later
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
shen
against
esperdy
which
is
reported
in
428
f.
2d.
now
admittedly,
section
203
(a)
(7)
of
the
statute
does
not
contain
a
specific
disqualification
of
refugees
who
have
been
firmly
resettled.
but
i
believe
that
the
purpose
to
exclude
them,
clearly
appears
if
we
examine
the
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
after
world
war
ii,
the
united
states
became
deeply
concerned
with
the
massive
problems
presented
by
millions
of
refugees’
leftover
from
that
war
and
it
developed
temporary
programs
to
deal
with
those
problems.
these
programs
were
reflected
in
a
series
of
measures
adopted
from
time
to
time.
the
first
of
these,
the
major
--
the
first
major
statute
was
the
displaced
persons
act
of
1948.
under
this
statute
in
a
three-and-a-half
year
period,
the
united
states
received
approximately
400,000
refugees.
that
statute
did
have
specific
language
disqualifying
refugees
who
are
permanently,
firmly
resettled.
the
next
major
statute
was
the
refugee
relief
act
of
1953
under
which,
approximately
200,000
refugees
were
received
into
the
united
states
and
again,
these
statutes
specifically
excluded
refugees
who
had
been
permanently
resettled.
after
that,
the
next
statute
was
the
refugee
act
of
1957.
this
was
a
temporary
statute
again
for
a
limited
purpose,
and
the
purpose
was
to
assign
approximately
18,000
visas
that
had
been
unused
when
the
refugee
relief
act
had
expired
at
the
end
of
1956.
the
1957
law
said
that
these
visas
should
be
assigned
to
a
group
known
as
refuge
escapees
and
in
designating
that
group,
it
did
not
mention
firm
resettlement.
the
next
of
these
temporary
statutes
was
the
so
called
fair
share
act
of
1960.
now,
this
again
was
a
temporary
measure.
it
was
designed
to
enable
the
united
states
to
participate
in
a
worldwide
movement
to
enable
the
united
nations
to
close
the
remaining
refugee
camps.
and
under
the
terms
of
this
statute,
the
united
states
undertook
to
receive
what
it
considered
its
fair
share
of
these
refugees
in
the
camps;
25%.
now
again,
this
statute
said
nothing
about
refugees
who
had
been
firmly
resettled.
mr.
charles
gordon
world
war
ii.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
that’s
completely
independent
and
came
later.
the
camps
remained
--
it’s
as
strange
as
it
may
seem
for
all
the
years
between
world
war
ii
and
1960.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
the
problem
had
not
yet
been
liquidated.
in
1960
–
1959,
the
united
nations
undertook
a
concerted
drive
to
close
these
camps
and
the
united
states
cooperated
with
that
movement
in
so
called
world
refugee
year
and
adopted
the
1960
law
as
part
of
that
movement.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
specifically
not
because
the
united
nations
mandate
to
which
it
was
tied
did
not
apply
to
the
middle
east.
again
as
i
said,
this
law,
the
1960
law
did
mention
firm
resettlement,
and
it
did
add
language
which
excluded
or
which
decreed
that
it
would
not
apply
to
those
who
were
nationals
of
the
country
in
which
their
application
was
made.
now
from
these
developments,
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
position,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
because
of
this
chain
of
events
and
the
changes
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
congress
had
intended
to
make
a
change.
in
the
language
of
the
court,
this
was
a
clear
manifestation
of
congressional
intent
to
change
the
criteria.
mr.
charles
gordon
two
things;
one
is
in
the
refugee
relief
act
of
1953
and
in
it
predecessor,
the
displaced
persons
act
of
1948,
there
was
specific
language
barring
refugees
who
had
been
from
the
resettlement.
second,
in
the
1960
fair
share
law,
there
was
new
language
saying
that
its
benefits
would
not
apply
to
those
who
are
nationals
of
the
country
in
which
the
application
was
made.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
this
addition
of
the
language
“not
a
national”
was
intended
to
be
a
substitution
for
the
criterion
of
those
firmly
resettled.
now,
no
legislative
history
is
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
support
this
conclusion,
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
congress
had
intended
such
a
marked
departure
from
the
previously
established
procedures,
criteria,
it
would
have
expressed
its
purpose
in
some
clear
manner.
yet,
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
is
there
any
indication
that
a
change
was
contemplated.
moreover,
the
second
circuit
in
a
very
careful
and
a
very
long
and
detailed
opinion,
studied
the
legislative
history
in
much
more
detail
and
let’s
say
than
the
ninth
circuit,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
change
had
been
intended.
i
think
the
1957
law
furnishes
the
key.
the
1957
law
was
the
first
law
which
changed
the
language,
which
eliminated
the
firmly
resettlement.
but
in
the
house
report,
reporting
this
legislation,
and
you
recall
your
honors,
this
legislation
was
intended
to
take
care
of
a
group
leftover
from
the
previous
law,
the
house
committee
said
they
intended
that
in
applying
this
law,
the
same
criteria
should
be
utilized.
so,
it
seems
obvious
that
no
change
was
intended.
mr.
charles
gordon
exactly.
mr.
charles
gordon
that’s
exactly
what
i
believe
the
statute
was
intended
to
deal
with.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
of
course,
we
agree
with
the
second
circuit,
but
i
think
that
as
i
develop
my
argument,
i
think
that
the
history
of
this
legislation
indicates
quite
decisively
that
these
statutes
are
intended
to
deal
with
homeless
people,
to
provide
the
haven
for
a
homeless
into
this
place.
now,
i
believe
the
“not
a
national
language”
which
was
inserted
for
the
first
time
in
1960
had
an
entirely
different
purpose
from
that
envisaged
by
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court,
unlike
the
second
circuit
which
is
i
say
considered
this
with
great
care,
the
court
below
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
1960
act
was
tied
to
the
mandate
of
the
united
nations,
united
nations
high
commissioner
for
refugees.
the
mandate
of
the
high
commissioner,
which
is
incorporated
in
a
u.n.
statute
specifically
declares,
among
other
things,
that
his
mandate
shall
not
extend
to
refugees
situated
in
the
country
of
their
nationality.
so
in
adopting
the
criteria
of
the
united
nations
congress
followed
that
formulation.
now
when
that
formulation
was
carried
over
into
the
1965
act,
which
succeeded
these
laws,
i
believe
congress
had
in
mind
the
change
in
world
conditions
that
had
occurred
by
that
time,
in
1965.
in
the
original
refugee
laws,
congress
confronted
a
world,
europe
particularly
that
was
shattered
by
war.
the
countries
of
europe,
even
the
countries
which
were
receiving
their
own
nationals
were
unable
to
care
for
such
nationals
and
therefore,
the
united
states
pitched
in
and
helped.
and
in
the
earlier
refugee
laws,
there
was
specific
provision
for
the
reception
of
greek,
dutch,
german
and
other
ethnic
refugees
who
were
situated
in
the
country
of
their
nationality,
italian
i
believe
is
the
other
one.
now,
by
the
time
the
1965
law
was
being
considered,
the
situations
as
i
said
had
changed.
congress
i
believe
concluded
that
these
nations
were
now
able
to
care
for
their
own
refugees
and
therefore,
it
inserted
this
proviso
that
it
would
not
extend
to
refugees
who
were
in
their
own
countries,
the
countries
of
their
nationality.
now
particularly,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
situation
of
west
germany,
which
may
have
been
in
the
mind
of
congress,
which
previously
had
been
the
beneficiary
of
all
the
refugee
laws
which
had
been
previously
enacted.
by
the
application
of
the
“not
a
national”
proviso,
congress
apparently
were
saying
that
since
germany
had
now
fully
recovered,
the
ethnic
german
refugees
who
are
coming
into
germany
could
be
cared
for
by
their
own
country,
and
it
was
no
longer
necessary
for
the
united
states
to
pitch
in
and
help.
i
think,
this
is
the
basis
for
the
adoption
by
congress
of
the
“not
a
national”
proviso
and
it
seems
to
me
completely
without
warrant
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
utilize
this
special
statutory
provision
for
the
aid
of
refugees
who
didn’t
need
immediate
help,
who
were
not
homeless,
who
were
not
displaced.
our
briefs
recite
the
consistent
administrative
interpretation
which
has
found
that
benefit
under
these
refugees
statutes
are
not
available
to
refugees
who
have
become
settled
and
stabled
new
homes.
mr.
charles
gordon
this
is
the
way
i
would
construe
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes.
it’s
a
slight
difference
in
the
present
practice.
national
is
a
person
owning
permanent
allegiance,
includes
citizens,
it’s
a
broader
term
than
citizens.
as
used
in
our
context
today,
i
think
it’s
synonymous
with
citizens.
now
as
i’ve
said,
the
administrative
interpretation
is
consistently
upheld
the
view
on
arguing
here
today.
for
example,
when
the
1957
act
was
adopted,
the
state
department
immediately
promulgated
regulations
which
announced
the
firmly
resettled
concept
even
though
the
law
hadn’t
said
anything
about
it.
in
addition,
a
series
of
reported
administrative
decisions
have
expressed
that
concept.
and
finally,
that
concept
has
been
reflected
in
reports
which
are
made
by
the
immigration
service
to
congress
every
six
months
showing
the
operations
under
section
203
(a)
(7)
as
required
by
section
203
(f)
of
the
statute.
now
congress
has
never
questioned
that
interpretation
and
indeed,
no
court
other
than
that
court
below
has
ever
reached
a
contrary
conclusion.
now,
respondent
seeks
to
find
support
for
his
interpretation
in
a
statement
made
by
senator
kennedy
during
the
course
of
the
debate
on
the
1965
law
in
which
senator
kennedy
said
that
section
203
(a)
(7)
refugees
and
i
quote
"must
be
currently
settled
in
countries
other
than
their
homelands."
this
statement
was
a
small
part
in
an
explanation
by
senator
kennedy
of
the
many
provisions
of
the
1965
law
which
primarily
was
adopted
to
abolish
the
national
origin's
coding
system.
i
think
senator
kennedy
was
not
addressing
the
concept,
he
didn’t
say
he
was
and
it
doesn’t
appear
that
he
was
addressing
the
concept
of
firm
resettlement.
in
context
and
reading
the
statement
in
entirety,
i
think
senator
kennedy
was
speaking
of
providing
homes
for
the
homeless,
for
the
displaced.
and
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
6,
we
set
forth
some
additional
excerpts
from
senator
kennedy’s
statements.
for
example,
senator
kennedy
spoke
of
the
need
for
this
country
to
remain
and
i
quote
“a
haven
for
the
displaced.”
and
that
again
and
i
quote
“the
cases
of
the
greatest
need
can
be
processed
at
once.”
later
in
the
floor
debate,
senator
kennedy
commented
that
the
bill,
again
i
quote
“establishes
what
we
mean
by
refugees,
those
fleeing
from
communist
dominations
and
from
the
other
categories
mentioned
in
the
statute.”
i
believe
senator
kennedy’s
reference
to
those
fleeing
is
an
accurate
paraphrase
of
the
statutory
requirement
that
speaks
of
those
who
have
fled
persecutions.
now,
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
senator
kennedy
--
there
was
a
colloquy
with
senator
quechol
who
had
questioned
--
quechol
--
who
had
question
him
about
the
scope
of
the
statutory
provision
and
to
what
extent
it
would
benefit
refugees
and
senator
kennedy
was
responding.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
1965
law.
this
is
the
law
which
is
in
the
question
here
today.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
your
honor
he
was
merely
paraphrasing
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
word
settled
no
where
appears
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
said
it,
but
he
wasn’t
reflecting
what
was
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
meant
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
paraphrasing
what
the
statute
said.
the
statute
said
that
the
refugee
must
not
be
in
the
country
of
his
nationality.
so
what
he
was
saying
is
that
they
must
be
in
some
other
country.
mr.
charles
gordon
settled.
and
at
settled,
i
think
he
must
mean
--
by
settle,
he
means
situated.
he
didn’t
mean
having
a
stable
home
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
right.
that’s
what
i
understand.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don’t
think
he
was
talking
about
in
that
context
at
all.
mr.
charles
gordon
as
far
as
i
know,
they
have,
but
they
have
the
right
to
return.
they
were
given
a
certificate
of
identity
which
gives
them
the
right
to
return.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
not
under
the
order
of
deportation.
the
order
of
deportation
is
against
respondent
and
his
wife
and
the
child
would
go
with
them
if
they
return,
of
course.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes
sir,
16
years
old.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
assume
so.
the
record
doesn’t
show.
he
came
here
to
attend
a
trade
fare
and
to
exhibit
his
goods
here.
i
assume
he
is
continued
in
some
business.
i
don’t
--
nothing
in
the
record
tells
us
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
doesn’t
but
i
assume
that
he
does
not.
his
wife
was
conducting
the
business
on
his
behalf
and
she
came
here
in
1965.
i
call
the
attention
to
one
other
facet
of
the
legislative
history,
and
that
is
the
remarks
of
senator
heart,
who
is
one
of
the
chief
sponsors
of
this
measure.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
name
was
the
leading
name
and
the
primary
name
on
the
bill
in
the
senate.
now,
in
speaking
of
--
describing
the
purpose
of
this
legislation,
senator
heart
said
its
concern
is
with
the
homeless
and
the
oppressed;
that’s
his
language.
and
i
think
that’s
a
correct
description
of
what
the
statute
means.
now,
section
203
(a)
(7)
reserved
10,200
numbers
for
refugees
within
its
description.
mr.
charles
gordon
there
were
applications
for
extension
until
1965.
then,
his
authorized
stay
expired
and
his
wife’s
did
to
and
a
deportation
proceeding
was
brought
and
they
were
found
deportable.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
no.
now,
the
--
i’ve
indicated
that
this
is
a
small
allotment,
10,200.
the
purpose
of
this
small
allotment,
i
think
is
revealed
in
his
legislative
history
is
to
afford,
grant
permanent
authority
to
deal
with
refugee
emergencies
as
they
arise.
this
--
mr.
charles
gordon
one
year.
this
is
an
annual
allotment.
mr.
charles
gordon
part
of
the
annual
quota;
6%
which
adds
out
to
10,200,
every
year
10,200.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
your
honor.
it
has
been
for
the
--
for
the
last
two
years,
there
was
a
very
heavy
pressure
on
it
and
indeed
in
the
1969,
the
chairman
and
25
members
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
wrote
to
attorney
general
saying
that
we
anticipate
the
this
will
be
over
subscribed,
had
to
admit
additional
refugees
on
the
parole
and
the
attorney
general
in
1970
agreed
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
first-come-first-serve,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
be
that
way.
they
are
allocated
on
the
monthly
basis
incidentally,
so
they
try
to
space
them
out.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
was
about
to
say
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
the
most
important
point
i
can
make.
the
point
is
that
this
is
a
small
allotment
intended
to
deal
with
emergencies
and
throughout
the
legislative
history,
the
sponsors
of
this
measure
and
the
committees
emphasized
the
need
to
keep
this
reserve
authority
in
the
hands
of
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
so
that
they
could
deal
with
emergencies
as
they
can
arise
--
as
they
do
arise.
now,
--
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
house,
the
principal
sponsors
were
senator
finn
and
--
excuse
me,
congressman
finn
and
congressman
sella.
in
the
senate,
the
principal
sponsors
were
senator
heart
and
senator
kennedy.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
if
there
were
--
there
are
a
number
of
discretionary
remedies
as
your
honor
knows.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don’t
know
whether
there
is
in
his
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
wouldn’t
be,
unless
he
can
establish
that
he
is
a
refugee,
and
he
hasn't
a
claim
that
he
has
any
right
or
any
eligibility
for
any
discretionary
benefit.
now
as
i
said,
this
is
a
small
allocation
and
the
fact
that
the
certainty
that
it
was
intended
for
emergencies
is
underlined
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
that
these
persons
shall
be
granted
conditional
entry.
mr.
charles
gordon
right,
and
emergencies
do
or
right
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
either
they
won’t
take
them
or
they
don’t
have
stable
residence
there.
they
let
them
stay
there
for
short
time.
they’ll
permit
them
to
remain,
for
example,
the
czechoslovak
situation,
many
czechoslovakian
refugees
crossed
the
border
and
came
into
adjacent
countries.
they
did
not
have
residence
privileges.
under
the
emergency
authority,
which
is
granted
in
this
statute,
the
president,
the
attorney
general
can
admit
them
immediately
to
this
country
as
conditional
entrance.
now
in
addition,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
design
for
emergency
action,
for
keeping
open
the
opportunity
to
deal
with
emergencies
is
underlined
by
the
statement
in
the
house
committee
report
on
the
1965
law
that
this
statute
and
i
quote
from
the
committee’s
report
“will
permit
the
president
to
act
immediately
if
the
situation
so
request
to
come
to
the
aid
of
refugees
as
defined
in
the
bill.”
i
believe
the
acceptance
of
respondent’s
interpretation
would
defeat
the
statutory
purpose.
approximately
two
million
refugees
have
--
from
china
have
settled
in
hong
kong.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don’t
believe
it’s
in
the
teeth.
the
statute
doesn’t
cover
the
situation,
but
that
statute
does
say
that
the
person
who
seeks
its
benefits
must
have
fled;
that’s
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
senator
kennedy’s
expression,
i
think
is
apt
one
referring
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
they
are
–
yes,
but
the
statute
then
goes
on
to
say
even
if
they
had
fled,
they
can’t
be
admitted
if
they
are
nationals
of
the
area
in
which
they
--
mr.
charles
gordon
if
they
had
fled.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
it’s
question
of
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
would
be
perhaps
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
it’s
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
possibly,
but
i
say
such
a
literal
reading
would
defeat
the
statutory
purpose
and
would
be
contrary
to
its
purpose
of
providing
emergency
authority
to
deal
with
the
homeless,
the
oppressed,
the
people
who
haven’t
got
a
place
to
go
to.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
had
fled,
but
he
was
no
longer
a
refugee
and
this
is
a
statute
to
deal
with
refugees.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
was
a
--
an
authorized
resident.
he’d
gotten
a
certificate
of
identity
which
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
50
plus
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
there’s
no
hong
kong
nationality.
mr.
charles
gordon
there’s
british
nationality,
and
british
nationality
is
a
worldwide
procedure
and
which
could
be
followed
in
hong
kong.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
he
never
applied
for
that
and
he
could
have
applied,
but
very
few
of
the
chinese
refugees
have
applied,
but
he
did
get
residence
privileges
in
hong
kong,
and
he
has
a
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
charles
gordon
business.
he
established
a
business
and
continued
that
business
for
seven
years.
he
had
a
home
there.
his
family
was
there.
he
continued
to
reside
there
for
seven
years.
mr.
charles
gordon
if
he
had
no
stable
residence,
he
might
still
be
a
refugee,
but
hong
kong
does
not
say
that.
hong
kong
permits
the
chinese
to
remain
there
as
residence
indefinitely.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
hong
kong
will
expel
them,
even
single
one
of
them.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
could
be
that
he
would
then
be
considered
a
refugee.
he
then
would
have
no
home.
he
then
would
be
displaced
because
of
the
events
that
went
back
to
1953
perhaps,
and
now
were
reinstated,
and
then
he
could
claim
to
be
a
refugee.
but
now
in
our
view,
he
has
a
stable
home.
he
is
a
person
who
can
return
to
his
home.
he
is
not
one
for
whom
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
the
record
shows
that
he
had
an
avid
desire
to
come
to
the
united
states
and
i
can
only
assume
that
coming
here
as
a
temporary
visitor,
he
intended
to
remain.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
an
alien
who
has
been
an
overstayed
temporary
visitor
in
the
united
states
since
1965,
claims
a
right
to
remain
under
a
statute
which
grants
special
benefits
to
refugees.
the
issue
concerns
the
construction
of
section
203
(a)
(7)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
affords
a
haven
for
refugees
who
have
been
--
who
are
fled
persecution
in
communist
countries,
who
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
return
and
who
are
not
nationals
of
the
country
or
area
in
which
their
application
is
made.
respondent
unquestionably
fled
communist
china
in
1953.
however,
like
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others,
his
flight
stopped
at
hong
kong
where
he
was
granted
generous
residence
privileges,
established
a
home,
was
married
and
had
a
child
and
continued
to
live
for
seven
years.
in
1959,
respondent
came
to
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
as
a
temporary
visitor
for
business.
he
stayed
a
few
months
and
returned
to
his
home
in
hong
kong.
mr.
charles
gordon
business.
mr.
charles
gordon
merchandizing
and
clothing.
in
1960,
the
respondent
again
came
to
the
united
states
as
a
business
visitor
and
left
his
wife
in
hong
kong
to
operate
the
family
business.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
left
alone
and
was
married
in
hong
kong,
and
the
child
was
born
in
hong
kong.
he
had
previously
been
married
in
communist
china.
his
wife
died
and
he
had
five
children
whom
he
left
there.
he
was
married
a
second
time
in
hong
kong
and
have
an
additional
child
in
hong
kong.
after
his
coming
to
the
united
states
in
1960,
the
respondent
continued
to
remain
in
the
united
states.
his
wife
and
child
followed
him
to
the
united
states
in
1965,
also
entering
as
temporary
visitors.
the
temporary
stay
of
the
entire
family
expired
in
1965
and
they
continued
to
remain
here.
deportation
proceedings
were
brought
against
respondent
and
his
wife
and
a
deportation
order
was
entered
against
them
with
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
california.
immediately,
the
respondent
filed
an
application
for
benefits
under
a
proviso
to
section
203
(a)
(7)
which
grants
refugee
benefits
to
refugees
who
have
lived
in
this
country
for
two
years.
that
application
was
denied
by
the
immigration
and
district
director
by
the
regional
commissioner
on
the
ground
that
the
respondent
was
no
longer
a
refugee
since
he
had
established
--
firmly
established
a
residence
and
a
home
in
hong
kong.
he
then
sought
judicial
review.
the
district
court
ruled
in
his
favor,
finding
that
he
had
not
been
from
the
resettle
in
hong
kong
because
of
this
allegation
that
he
have
never
intended
to
remain
their
permanently
and
that
he
harbored
an
intention
to
come
to
the
united
states
at
all
times.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
they
found,
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
question
of
whether
he
was
firmly
resettled
was
irrelevant.
the
court
said
that
under
the
statute,
once
respondent
had
been
a
refugee,
he
was
entitled
to
its
benefits
even
though
he
had
established
a
stable
new
home
in
another
country.
this
con
--
mr.
charles
gordon
it
had
and
in
a
moment,
i
shall
--
mr.
charles
gordon
--
develop
that.
that
conclusion
incidentally
is
opposed
by
the
later
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
shen
against
esperdy
which
is
reported
in
428
f.
2d.
now
admittedly,
section
203
(a)
(7)
of
the
statute
does
not
contain
a
specific
disqualification
of
refugees
who
have
been
firmly
resettled.
but
i
believe
that
the
purpose
to
exclude
them,
clearly
appears
if
we
examine
the
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
after
world
war
ii,
the
united
states
became
deeply
concerned
with
the
massive
problems
presented
by
millions
of
refugees’
leftover
from
that
war
and
it
developed
temporary
programs
to
deal
with
those
problems.
these
programs
were
reflected
in
a
series
of
measures
adopted
from
time
to
time.
the
first
of
these,
the
major
--
the
first
major
statute
was
the
displaced
persons
act
of
1948.
under
this
statute
in
a
three-and-a-half
year
period,
the
united
states
received
approximately
400,000
refugees.
that
statute
did
have
specific
language
disqualifying
refugees
who
are
permanently,
firmly
resettled.
the
next
major
statute
was
the
refugee
relief
act
of
1953
under
which,
approximately
200,000
refugees
were
received
into
the
united
states
and
again,
these
statutes
specifically
excluded
refugees
who
had
been
permanently
resettled.
after
that,
the
next
statute
was
the
refugee
act
of
1957.
this
was
a
temporary
statute
again
for
a
limited
purpose,
and
the
purpose
was
to
assign
approximately
18,000
visas
that
had
been
unused
when
the
refugee
relief
act
had
expired
at
the
end
of
1956.
the
1957
law
said
that
these
visas
should
be
assigned
to
a
group
known
as
refuge
escapees
and
in
designating
that
group,
it
did
not
mention
firm
resettlement.
the
next
of
these
temporary
statutes
was
the
so
called
fair
share
act
of
1960.
now,
this
again
was
a
temporary
measure.
it
was
designed
to
enable
the
united
states
to
participate
in
a
worldwide
movement
to
enable
the
united
nations
to
close
the
remaining
refugee
camps.
and
under
the
terms
of
this
statute,
the
united
states
undertook
to
receive
what
it
considered
its
fair
share
of
these
refugees
in
the
camps;
25%.
now
again,
this
statute
said
nothing
about
refugees
who
had
been
firmly
resettled.
mr.
charles
gordon
world
war
ii.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
that’s
completely
independent
and
came
later.
the
camps
remained
--
it’s
as
strange
as
it
may
seem
for
all
the
years
between
world
war
ii
and
1960.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
the
problem
had
not
yet
been
liquidated.
in
1960
–
1959,
the
united
nations
undertook
a
concerted
drive
to
close
these
camps
and
the
united
states
cooperated
with
that
movement
in
so
called
world
refugee
year
and
adopted
the
1960
law
as
part
of
that
movement.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
specifically
not
because
the
united
nations
mandate
to
which
it
was
tied
did
not
apply
to
the
middle
east.
again
as
i
said,
this
law,
the
1960
law
did
mention
firm
resettlement,
and
it
did
add
language
which
excluded
or
which
decreed
that
it
would
not
apply
to
those
who
were
nationals
of
the
country
in
which
their
application
was
made.
now
from
these
developments,
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
position,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
because
of
this
chain
of
events
and
the
changes
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
congress
had
intended
to
make
a
change.
in
the
language
of
the
court,
this
was
a
clear
manifestation
of
congressional
intent
to
change
the
criteria.
mr.
charles
gordon
two
things;
one
is
in
the
refugee
relief
act
of
1953
and
in
it
predecessor,
the
displaced
persons
act
of
1948,
there
was
specific
language
barring
refugees
who
had
been
from
the
resettlement.
second,
in
the
1960
fair
share
law,
there
was
new
language
saying
that
its
benefits
would
not
apply
to
those
who
are
nationals
of
the
country
in
which
the
application
was
made.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
this
addition
of
the
language
“not
a
national”
was
intended
to
be
a
substitution
for
the
criterion
of
those
firmly
resettled.
now,
no
legislative
history
is
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
support
this
conclusion,
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
congress
had
intended
such
a
marked
departure
from
the
previously
established
procedures,
criteria,
it
would
have
expressed
its
purpose
in
some
clear
manner.
yet,
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
is
there
any
indication
that
a
change
was
contemplated.
moreover,
the
second
circuit
in
a
very
careful
and
a
very
long
and
detailed
opinion,
studied
the
legislative
history
in
much
more
detail
and
let’s
say
than
the
ninth
circuit,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
change
had
been
intended.
i
think
the
1957
law
furnishes
the
key.
the
1957
law
was
the
first
law
which
changed
the
language,
which
eliminated
the
firmly
resettlement.
but
in
the
house
report,
reporting
this
legislation,
and
you
recall
your
honors,
this
legislation
was
intended
to
take
care
of
a
group
leftover
from
the
previous
law,
the
house
committee
said
they
intended
that
in
applying
this
law,
the
same
criteria
should
be
utilized.
so,
it
seems
obvious
that
no
change
was
intended.
mr.
charles
gordon
exactly.
mr.
charles
gordon
that’s
exactly
what
i
believe
the
statute
was
intended
to
deal
with.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
of
course,
we
agree
with
the
second
circuit,
but
i
think
that
as
i
develop
my
argument,
i
think
that
the
history
of
this
legislation
indicates
quite
decisively
that
these
statutes
are
intended
to
deal
with
homeless
people,
to
provide
the
haven
for
a
homeless
into
this
place.
now,
i
believe
the
“not
a
national
language”
which
was
inserted
for
the
first
time
in
1960
had
an
entirely
different
purpose
from
that
envisaged
by
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court,
unlike
the
second
circuit
which
is
i
say
considered
this
with
great
care,
the
court
below
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
1960
act
was
tied
to
the
mandate
of
the
united
nations,
united
nations
high
commissioner
for
refugees.
the
mandate
of
the
high
commissioner,
which
is
incorporated
in
a
u.n.
statute
specifically
declares,
among
other
things,
that
his
mandate
shall
not
extend
to
refugees
situated
in
the
country
of
their
nationality.
so
in
adopting
the
criteria
of
the
united
nations
congress
followed
that
formulation.
now
when
that
formulation
was
carried
over
into
the
1965
act,
which
succeeded
these
laws,
i
believe
congress
had
in
mind
the
change
in
world
conditions
that
had
occurred
by
that
time,
in
1965.
in
the
original
refugee
laws,
congress
confronted
a
world,
europe
particularly
that
was
shattered
by
war.
the
countries
of
europe,
even
the
countries
which
were
receiving
their
own
nationals
were
unable
to
care
for
such
nationals
and
therefore,
the
united
states
pitched
in
and
helped.
and
in
the
earlier
refugee
laws,
there
was
specific
provision
for
the
reception
of
greek,
dutch,
german
and
other
ethnic
refugees
who
were
situated
in
the
country
of
their
nationality,
italian
i
believe
is
the
other
one.
now,
by
the
time
the
1965
law
was
being
considered,
the
situations
as
i
said
had
changed.
congress
i
believe
concluded
that
these
nations
were
now
able
to
care
for
their
own
refugees
and
therefore,
it
inserted
this
proviso
that
it
would
not
extend
to
refugees
who
were
in
their
own
countries,
the
countries
of
their
nationality.
now
particularly,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
situation
of
west
germany,
which
may
have
been
in
the
mind
of
congress,
which
previously
had
been
the
beneficiary
of
all
the
refugee
laws
which
had
been
previously
enacted.
by
the
application
of
the
“not
a
national”
proviso,
congress
apparently
were
saying
that
since
germany
had
now
fully
recovered,
the
ethnic
german
refugees
who
are
coming
into
germany
could
be
cared
for
by
their
own
country,
and
it
was
no
longer
necessary
for
the
united
states
to
pitch
in
and
help.
i
think,
this
is
the
basis
for
the
adoption
by
congress
of
the
“not
a
national”
proviso
and
it
seems
to
me
completely
without
warrant
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
utilize
this
special
statutory
provision
for
the
aid
of
refugees
who
didn’t
need
immediate
help,
who
were
not
homeless,
who
were
not
displaced.
our
briefs
recite
the
consistent
administrative
interpretation
which
has
found
that
benefit
under
these
refugees
statutes
are
not
available
to
refugees
who
have
become
settled
and
stabled
new
homes.
mr.
charles
gordon
this
is
the
way
i
would
construe
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes.
it’s
a
slight
difference
in
the
present
practice.
national
is
a
person
owning
permanent
allegiance,
includes
citizens,
it’s
a
broader
term
than
citizens.
as
used
in
our
context
today,
i
think
it’s
synonymous
with
citizens.
now
as
i’ve
said,
the
administrative
interpretation
is
consistently
upheld
the
view
on
arguing
here
today.
for
example,
when
the
1957
act
was
adopted,
the
state
department
immediately
promulgated
regulations
which
announced
the
firmly
resettled
concept
even
though
the
law
hadn’t
said
anything
about
it.
in
addition,
a
series
of
reported
administrative
decisions
have
expressed
that
concept.
and
finally,
that
concept
has
been
reflected
in
reports
which
are
made
by
the
immigration
service
to
congress
every
six
months
showing
the
operations
under
section
203
(a)
(7)
as
required
by
section
203
(f)
of
the
statute.
now
congress
has
never
questioned
that
interpretation
and
indeed,
no
court
other
than
that
court
below
has
ever
reached
a
contrary
conclusion.
now,
respondent
seeks
to
find
support
for
his
interpretation
in
a
statement
made
by
senator
kennedy
during
the
course
of
the
debate
on
the
1965
law
in
which
senator
kennedy
said
that
section
203
(a)
(7)
refugees
and
i
quote
"must
be
currently
settled
in
countries
other
than
their
homelands."
this
statement
was
a
small
part
in
an
explanation
by
senator
kennedy
of
the
many
provisions
of
the
1965
law
which
primarily
was
adopted
to
abolish
the
national
origin's
coding
system.
i
think
senator
kennedy
was
not
addressing
the
concept,
he
didn’t
say
he
was
and
it
doesn’t
appear
that
he
was
addressing
the
concept
of
firm
resettlement.
in
context
and
reading
the
statement
in
entirety,
i
think
senator
kennedy
was
speaking
of
providing
homes
for
the
homeless,
for
the
displaced.
and
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
6,
we
set
forth
some
additional
excerpts
from
senator
kennedy’s
statements.
for
example,
senator
kennedy
spoke
of
the
need
for
this
country
to
remain
and
i
quote
“a
haven
for
the
displaced.”
and
that
again
and
i
quote
“the
cases
of
the
greatest
need
can
be
processed
at
once.”
later
in
the
floor
debate,
senator
kennedy
commented
that
the
bill,
again
i
quote
“establishes
what
we
mean
by
refugees,
those
fleeing
from
communist
dominations
and
from
the
other
categories
mentioned
in
the
statute.”
i
believe
senator
kennedy’s
reference
to
those
fleeing
is
an
accurate
paraphrase
of
the
statutory
requirement
that
speaks
of
those
who
have
fled
persecutions.
now,
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
senator
kennedy
--
there
was
a
colloquy
with
senator
quechol
who
had
questioned
--
quechol
--
who
had
question
him
about
the
scope
of
the
statutory
provision
and
to
what
extent
it
would
benefit
refugees
and
senator
kennedy
was
responding.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
1965
law.
this
is
the
law
which
is
in
the
question
here
today.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
your
honor
he
was
merely
paraphrasing
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
word
settled
no
where
appears
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
said
it,
but
he
wasn’t
reflecting
what
was
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
meant
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
paraphrasing
what
the
statute
said.
the
statute
said
that
the
refugee
must
not
be
in
the
country
of
his
nationality.
so
what
he
was
saying
is
that
they
must
be
in
some
other
country.
mr.
charles
gordon
settled.
and
at
settled,
i
think
he
must
mean
--
by
settle,
he
means
situated.
he
didn’t
mean
having
a
stable
home
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
right.
that’s
what
i
understand.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don’t
think
he
was
talking
about
in
that
context
at
all.
mr.
charles
gordon
as
far
as
i
know,
they
have,
but
they
have
the
right
to
return.
they
were
given
a
certificate
of
identity
which
gives
them
the
right
to
return.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
not
under
the
order
of
deportation.
the
order
of
deportation
is
against
respondent
and
his
wife
and
the
child
would
go
with
them
if
they
return,
of
course.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes
sir,
16
years
old.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
assume
so.
the
record
doesn’t
show.
he
came
here
to
attend
a
trade
fare
and
to
exhibit
his
goods
here.
i
assume
he
is
continued
in
some
business.
i
don’t
--
nothing
in
the
record
tells
us
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
doesn’t
but
i
assume
that
he
does
not.
his
wife
was
conducting
the
business
on
his
behalf
and
she
came
here
in
1965.
i
call
the
attention
to
one
other
facet
of
the
legislative
history,
and
that
is
the
remarks
of
senator
heart,
who
is
one
of
the
chief
sponsors
of
this
measure.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
name
was
the
leading
name
and
the
primary
name
on
the
bill
in
the
senate.
now,
in
speaking
of
--
describing
the
purpose
of
this
legislation,
senator
heart
said
its
concern
is
with
the
homeless
and
the
oppressed;
that’s
his
language.
and
i
think
that’s
a
correct
description
of
what
the
statute
means.
now,
section
203
(a)
(7)
reserved
10,200
numbers
for
refugees
within
its
description.
mr.
charles
gordon
there
were
applications
for
extension
until
1965.
then,
his
authorized
stay
expired
and
his
wife’s
did
to
and
a
deportation
proceeding
was
brought
and
they
were
found
deportable.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
no.
now,
the
--
i’ve
indicated
that
this
is
a
small
allotment,
10,200.
the
purpose
of
this
small
allotment,
i
think
is
revealed
in
his
legislative
history
is
to
afford,
grant
permanent
authority
to
deal
with
refugee
emergencies
as
they
arise.
this
--
mr.
charles
gordon
one
year.
this
is
an
annual
allotment.
mr.
charles
gordon
part
of
the
annual
quota;
6%
which
adds
out
to
10,200,
every
year
10,200.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
your
honor.
it
has
been
for
the
--
for
the
last
two
years,
there
was
a
very
heavy
pressure
on
it
and
indeed
in
the
1969,
the
chairman
and
25
members
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
wrote
to
attorney
general
saying
that
we
anticipate
the
this
will
be
over
subscribed,
had
to
admit
additional
refugees
on
the
parole
and
the
attorney
general
in
1970
agreed
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
gordon
first-come-first-serve,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
be
that
way.
they
are
allocated
on
the
monthly
basis
incidentally,
so
they
try
to
space
them
out.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
was
about
to
say
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
the
most
important
point
i
can
make.
the
point
is
that
this
is
a
small
allotment
intended
to
deal
with
emergencies
and
throughout
the
legislative
history,
the
sponsors
of
this
measure
and
the
committees
emphasized
the
need
to
keep
this
reserve
authority
in
the
hands
of
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
so
that
they
could
deal
with
emergencies
as
they
can
arise
--
as
they
do
arise.
now,
--
mr.
charles
gordon
in
the
house,
the
principal
sponsors
were
senator
finn
and
--
excuse
me,
congressman
finn
and
congressman
sella.
in
the
senate,
the
principal
sponsors
were
senator
heart
and
senator
kennedy.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
if
there
were
--
there
are
a
number
of
discretionary
remedies
as
your
honor
knows.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don’t
know
whether
there
is
in
his
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
wouldn’t
be,
unless
he
can
establish
that
he
is
a
refugee,
and
he
hasn't
a
claim
that
he
has
any
right
or
any
eligibility
for
any
discretionary
benefit.
now
as
i
said,
this
is
a
small
allocation
and
the
fact
that
the
certainty
that
it
was
intended
for
emergencies
is
underlined
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
that
these
persons
shall
be
granted
conditional
entry.
mr.
charles
gordon
right,
and
emergencies
do
or
right
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
either
they
won’t
take
them
or
they
don’t
have
stable
residence
there.
they
let
them
stay
there
for
short
time.
they’ll
permit
them
to
remain,
for
example,
the
czechoslovak
situation,
many
czechoslovakian
refugees
crossed
the
border
and
came
into
adjacent
countries.
they
did
not
have
residence
privileges.
under
the
emergency
authority,
which
is
granted
in
this
statute,
the
president,
the
attorney
general
can
admit
them
immediately
to
this
country
as
conditional
entrance.
now
in
addition,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
design
for
emergency
action,
for
keeping
open
the
opportunity
to
deal
with
emergencies
is
underlined
by
the
statement
in
the
house
committee
report
on
the
1965
law
that
this
statute
and
i
quote
from
the
committee’s
report
“will
permit
the
president
to
act
immediately
if
the
situation
so
request
to
come
to
the
aid
of
refugees
as
defined
in
the
bill.”
i
believe
the
acceptance
of
respondent’s
interpretation
would
defeat
the
statutory
purpose.
approximately
two
million
refugees
have
--
from
china
have
settled
in
hong
kong.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don’t
believe
it’s
in
the
teeth.
the
statute
doesn’t
cover
the
situation,
but
that
statute
does
say
that
the
person
who
seeks
its
benefits
must
have
fled;
that’s
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
senator
kennedy’s
expression,
i
think
is
apt
one
referring
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
they
are
–
yes,
but
the
statute
then
goes
on
to
say
even
if
they
had
fled,
they
can’t
be
admitted
if
they
are
nationals
of
the
area
in
which
they
--
mr.
charles
gordon
if
they
had
fled.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
it’s
question
of
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
would
be
perhaps
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
gordon
it’s
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
possibly,
but
i
say
such
a
literal
reading
would
defeat
the
statutory
purpose
and
would
be
contrary
to
its
purpose
of
providing
emergency
authority
to
deal
with
the
homeless,
the
oppressed,
the
people
who
haven’t
got
a
place
to
go
to.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
had
fled,
but
he
was
no
longer
a
refugee
and
this
is
a
statute
to
deal
with
refugees.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
was
a
--
an
authorized
resident.
he’d
gotten
a
certificate
of
identity
which
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
50
plus
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
there’s
no
hong
kong
nationality.
mr.
charles
gordon
there’s
british
nationality,
and
british
nationality
is
a
worldwide
procedure
and
which
could
be
followed
in
hong
kong.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
he
never
applied
for
that
and
he
could
have
applied,
but
very
few
of
the
chinese
refugees
have
applied,
but
he
did
get
residence
privileges
in
hong
kong,
and
he
has
a
certificate
of
identity.
mr.
charles
gordon
business.
he
established
a
business
and
continued
that
business
for
seven
years.
he
had
a
home
there.
his
family
was
there.
he
continued
to
reside
there
for
seven
years.
mr.
charles
gordon
if
he
had
no
stable
residence,
he
might
still
be
a
refugee,
but
hong
kong
does
not
say
that.
hong
kong
permits
the
chinese
to
remain
there
as
residence
indefinitely.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
hong
kong
will
expel
them,
even
single
one
of
them.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
could
be
that
he
would
then
be
considered
a
refugee.
he
then
would
have
no
home.
he
then
would
be
displaced
because
of
the
events
that
went
back
to
1953
perhaps,
and
now
were
reinstated,
and
then
he
could
claim
to
be
a
refugee.
but
now
in
our
view,
he
has
a
stable
home.
he
is
a
person
who
can
return
to
his
home.
he
is
not
one
for
whom
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
the
record
shows
that
he
had
an
avid
desire
to
come
to
the
united
states
and
i
can
only
assume
that
coming
here
as
a
temporary
visitor,
he
intended
to
remain.
thank
you.
