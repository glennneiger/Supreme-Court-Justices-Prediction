mr.
j.
martin
cornell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
issue
involve
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
numbers.
rockland
county
is
a
relatively
small
county
and
politically
it’s
a
swing
county.
it’s
sometimes
a
democratic
and
it’s
sometimes
as
republic.
the
board
of
supervisors
consisting
of
the
five
supervisors
originally
was
a
democratically
controlled
board
and
they
devise
this
plan
of
reapportionment
and
after
the
last
selection
of
the
board
became
or
the
new
legislative
body
became
republicans
so
that
politics
really
is
not
involved
in
this
case
since
it
swings
back
and
forth.
the
original
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
in
the
case
at
all,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
the
original
board
of
supervisors
felt
that
it
was
important
to
maintain
a
voice
on
the
county
level
of
government
from
the
towns
and
that’s
what
brought
about
this
type
of
multi-member
district
plan
and
that’s
really
the
only
thing
that’s
involved
here.
also,
it
was
felt
that
there
were
certain
towns
like
the
smallest
town,
town
of
stony
point
that
was
somewhat
isolated
from
the
other
towns
which
are
large
and
they
wanted
to
have
a
voice
of
their
own.
they
didn’t
want
to
be
amalgamated
with
a
not
a
larger
area
and
perhaps
ease
that
type
of
identity
which
that
community
had
had
over
the
many
years.
so
what
we’re
talking
about
really
is
numbers
here.
it
is
our
position
that
the
plan
which
was
devise
complies
with
the
rule
which
was
set
down
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
apply
to
local
governments
in
avery
versus
midland
county
which
requires
that
the
population
be
substantially
equal
or
in
other
terms
as
was
used
that
as
nearly
as
practical
--
practicable
the
district’s
view
of
equal
population
and
we
feel
that
we
have
actually
met
that
test.
now,
i
am
set
forth
in
appendix
a-2
of
my
brief
a
complete
breakdown
of
how
these
figures
operate
and
at
the
present
time,
based
upon
the
1969
census,
the
population
variation
which
is
the
largest
is
in
the
town
of
orangetown
where
the
deviation
is
7.1%
underrepresented
and
then
the
town
of
clarkstown
that’s
4.8%
overrepresented
making
a
spread
of
11.9%
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest.
now
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
as
of
1970
and
these
figures
are
not
before
the
court
because
these
figures
are
very
recent,
the
1970
census
has
reduced
these
population
disparity
so
that
the
town
of
orangetown
which
did
have
a
7.1%
under
representation,
now
is
underrepresented
by
4.7%.
the
town
of
clarkstown
which
had
a
4.8%
variation
now
has
a
3.2%
variation.
the
town
of
ramapo
has
a
0%
deviation
that
hits
it
right
on
the
nose.
haverstraw
has
a
0.8%
variation
at
the
present
time
and
that
the
town
of
stony
point,
it
changes
from
0.3%
to
1.1%.
now,
the
spread
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
now
is
7.9%
so
that
the
deviation
between
these
two
smallest
and
largest
of
7.1%.
now
in
terms
of
absolute
population,
this
amounts
to
1,017
people.
if
you
take
the
town
--
orangetown
which
has
a
deviation
of
4.7%
to
bring
that
into
line,
you
would
have
to
shift
the
lines
around
some
400
or
500
people
which
we
feel
is
unrealistic
because
in
fact
it
means
that
you
may
have
to
cut
a
district
line
down
somebody’s
backyard
of
even
to
an
apartment
building
to
pick
up
that
number
of
people.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
factors
that’s
extremely
important
here
is
to
recognize
that
when
you
talk
about
percentage
deviations,
you
must
consider
the
size
of
the
district
which
is
involved.
now
for
example
in
wells
versus
rockefeller
involving
the
state
of
new
york
which
was
approved
by
this
court
in
may,
the
new
districting
plan
on
the
congressional
level.
the
average
population
for
the
congressional
district
in
new
york
which
is
approved
was
490,324.
now
1%
deviation
in
the
congressional
district
would
amount
to
an
absolute
population
of
4,000,
a
little
over
4,000
people.
now,
it’s
one
thing
to
shift
to
district
lines
around
to
pick
up
or
exclude
4,000
people.
but
a
1%
deviation
in
rockland
county
amounts
to
1%
of
the
main
population
of
12,000
or
approximately
a
121
people.
and
it
is
impractical
and
unrealistic
to
consider
a
necessity
of
shifting
or
moving
lines
or
adjusting
legislators
to
pick
up
or
exclude
a
121
people
to
provide
for
1%
deviation
of
more.
therefore,
it
is
our
position
that
you
must
look
at
the
size
of
the
district
in
relation
to
an
analysis
of
percentage
deviations
so
that
it
can
be
a
practical
application
of
rule.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
question
which
was
raised
in
the
hadley
case
involving
the
trustees
in
the
community
college
which
was
not
approve
by
this
court
was
a
different
type
of
situation.
there
you
had
a
built-in
bias
in
favor
of
the
smaller
districts.
there
were
six
trustees
that
were
elected
and
the
larger
district
would
only
get
three
trustees
if
they
were
from
50%
to
60%
of
the
school
enumeration
in
that
case.
and
this
court
said
in
that
case
that
you
are
not
reaching
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
equal
apportionment
of
trustees
among
a
limited
number
of
component
districts.
and
you
stated
that
he
have
said
before
that
mathematical
exactitude
is
not
required
but
a
plan
that
does
not
automatically
discriminate
in
favor
or
certain
districts
is
and
in
that
case,
that’s
exactly
what
there
was.
there
was
a
built-in
bias
and
an
automatic
discrimination
against
the
larger
districts.
there’s
a
built-in
bias
in
favor
of
the
smaller
districts.
that
problem
is
not
found
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
merely
have
a
situation
where
there
were
equal
member
districts
--
multi-member
districts
and
there
is
no
built-in
bias
that’s
in
favor
of
the
smaller
or
the
larger
districts.
there
was
reliance
by
the
petitioner
here
upon
kirkpatrick
versus
preisler
and
wells
versus
rockefeller.
these
were
both
congressional
cases
and
in
the
wells
versus
rockefeller
case,
there
was
a
rejection
of
a
maximum
population
spread
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
of
approximately
13%.
in
the
kirkpatrick
case
involving
the
congressional
districts
in
missouri,
there
was
a
rejection
of
a
spread
of
approximately
6%
between
the
highest
and
lowest.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
you
cannot
on
a
wholesale
basis
take
these
percentage
deviations
that
may
not
be
acceptable
on
a
congressional
level
and
transpose
them
down
onto
smaller
districts
where
there
is
smaller
populations
involved.
also,
i
think
the
facts
in
both
of
those
cases
are
distinguishable.
in
wells
versus
rockefeller,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
state
of
new
york
admitted
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
provide
equal
population
for
sub-districts
and
that
the
congressional
districts
were
then
carved
out
of
these
regional
districts
within
the
state
and
the
record
shows
that
the
state
admits
that
there
was
not
an
effort
really
to
fine
home
the
district
lines
on
the
congressional
level.
in
the
missouri
case,
there
are
also
indications
that,
number
one
there
was
not
a
proper
census
data
that
was
made
for
determining
the
district
lines.
and
also
there
is
a
clear
admission
in
that
case,
that
merely
by
shifting
several
counties
around
that
they
could
have
provided
for
a
more
equal
population
in
those
congressional
districts.
we
don’t
have
that
situation
in
this
case
at
all.
the
town
lines
have
been
used
as
the
district
lines
and
the
legislators
have
been
allocated
to
the
towns
in
accordance
with
the
population
and
as
i
say
the
population
deviation
is
extremely
minimal
and
there
is
no
way
that
you
could
arrive
at
a
lesser
population
deviation
if
you
would
hear
the
town
lines.
this
is
the
only
way
that
it
can
be
done.
now,
chief
judge
fuld
in
the
court
of
appeals
dissented.
and
he
asked
me
when
i
argued
that
case
off
the
bench
whether
i
wasn’t
concerned
about
the
future
population
changes
and
whether
or
not
this
plan
might
depending
upon
how
the
figures
came
out
subsequently
result
in
a
more
substantial
deviation.
before
i
had
a
chance
to
answer
the
question,
judge
breitel
said
yes
but
the
figures
might
get
better.
and
that’s
exactly
what
happened
here.
so
i
think
that
the
argument
that
he
relies
upon
his
dissent
has
been
undercut
by
what
actually
has
happened
here.
any
plan
whether
it’s
a
single-member
district
plan
or
a
multi-member
district
plan
as
soon
as
the
population
changes
whether
it
be
the
next
year
or
thereafter,
there
may
have
to
be
some
adjustment
to
account
for
the
changes
in
population.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
the
population
figures
that
resulted
in
1970
improved
the
situations,
so
the
population
deviation
now
is
as
low
as
i
mentioned
before
7.9%.
so
i
think
the
reasoning
that
judge
fuld
set
forth
in
his
dissenting
opinion
cannot
be
upheld
based
upon
actually
what
happened.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
for
purposes
of
securing
additional
state
aid
on
a
local
level,
it’s
frequently
is
advisable
if
a
population
and
a
growing
to
have
a
census
taken
to
determine
what
the
population
is.
they
do
it
every
three
years.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
it’s
done
by
the
bureau
of
census
in
washington.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
federal
bureau
of
census.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely,
if
the
population
figure
show
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
it’s
true
of
any
plan.
it’s
true
of
a
single-member
district
plan,
you
have
to
re-draw
district
plans
and
in
a
multi-member
district
plan,
if
you
have
this
problem,
you
might
then
consider
the
possibility
if
there
was
substantial
deviations
of
providing
for
fractional
vote
that
would
be
spread
among
those
legislators.
it’s
just
a
possibility
but
there
are
number
of
things
that
could
be
done.
but
any
case,
if
there
was
a
population
change,
and
if
the
deviation
was
substantial
then
of
course
the
then
legislation
would
have
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
rectify
that
deviation.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
the
people
of
rockland
county
had
two
referendums.
initially,
they
had
a
referendum
on
a
plan
which
is
almost
identical
with
this
plan
and
they
rejected
it.
about
seven
months
later,
there
was
a
second
referendum
that
had
this
plan
plus
a
single-member
district
plan
which
is
the
plan
which
the
petitioners
were
asking
for
and
the
voters
rejected
both
of
those.
then
the
court
was
asked
on
a
temporary
basis
to
impose
a
weighted
voting
plan
until
a
permanent
plan
could
be
devised
because
the
voters
kept
rejecting
everything
that
was
presented
to
them.
the
court
said
no
that
they
felt
it
a
weighted
voting
plan
in
this
county
was
not
feasible
and
i
agree
with
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
reason
is
that
rockland
county
if
it’s
analyzed
mathematically,
the
larger
towns
because
of
their
size
would
be
in
a
position
to
nullify
any
vote
or
any
vote
that
would
be
accorded
to
the
smaller
town
because
it
is
such
a
small
town.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
because
here
you
have
multi-member
districts
whereby
you
have
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
but
you
have
18
bodies
on
the
legislature.
if
you
had
one
body
with
six
votes,
unless
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
way
the
plan
would
function
would
be
that
you
would
always
give
one
legislator
to
the
smallest
town.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
no.
actually,
the
way
i
devise
this
plan
was
that
you
start
off
by
giving
the
smallest
town
one
representative.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
and
then
you
divide
the
population
of
the
smallest
town
into
the
others
to
generate
the
proper
number
of
legislator’s
fee
of
the
town.
so
that
what
fluctuates
is
the
number
of
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
if
it
did,
of
course
it
had
to
change
the
plan.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
correct.
in
other
words,
some
mechanism
would
have
to
be
devised
to
provide
for
that
deviation.
i
think
it’s
important
in
this
reapportionment
case
to
recognize
what’s
involved
here
between
town
and
county
government
because
this
is
really
the
stimulus
for
this
type
of
plan.
in
the
state
of
new
york,
county
governments
in
the
past
have
been
run
by
the
supervisors
who
are
the
chief
executive
officers
in
the
towns
within
the
county.
there
was
never
any
legislative
body
on
the
county
level
that
was
directly
elected.
the
town
selected
a
chief
executive
officer
who
served
on
the
county
border
supervisors
and
actually
an
ex-officio
capacity
and
would
run
the
county
government.
therefore,
the
towns
had
a
direct
voice
in
the
operation
of
county
government.
and
on
the
county
level,
there
are
a
number
of
functions
of
county
government
which
can
also
be
performed
on
the
town
level.
and
the
desirability
of
having
an
interrelationship
between
a
town
and
county
government,
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
supervisors
was
to
provide
for
the
conduct
of
business
on
this
countywide
basis
so
that
there
would
be
an
interrelationship
between
the
operation
of
both
county
and
town
government.
for
example,
there
is
a
large
county
sewer
district
in
the
county
of
rockland
which
has
a
sewer
plant
and
sewer
lines
which
ties
indirectly
with
lateral
lines
in
the
towns
so
that
this
function
of
providing
sewer
service
is
directly
interrelated
between
town
and
county
government.
the
county
has
a
civil
service
department
which
administers
the
civil
service
on
the
town
level.
there
is
a
very
direct
physical
interrelationship
between
the
town
and
county
governments.
the
towns
assess
the
real
property.
the
towns
adopt
their
budget
and
then
the
towns
transmit
the
amount
of
money
to
be
raised
by
taxes
to
the
county
level
and
the
county
legislature
then
levies
the
tax
and
directs
the
town
receiver
of
taxes
to
collect
the
tax.
and
then
if
their
moneys
are
not
paid
as
required
it
is
then
sent
back
to
the
county
to
collect
the
delinquent
taxes
so
that
this
is
a
very
direct
type
or
interrelationship
between
the
town
and
county
government
which
has
grown
up
historically
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
my
position
is
that
the
test
of
substantial
equality
applies
on
the
local
level
and
that
the
equal
protection
clause
must
apply
on
the
congressional
state
and
local
level.
but
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely,
it’s
the
same
test
but
when
you
ascertain
whether
there
has
been
substantial
equality
or
not,
you
must
look
at
the
numbers
--
the
figures
that
you’re
dealing
with.
now,
for
example,
in
the
kirkpatrick
case,
this
court
said
the
whole
thrust
of
as
nearly
as
practical
approach
is
inconsistent
with
the
adoption
of
the
fixed
numerical
standard
which
excuses
population
variances
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
i’m
also
taking
the
initial
premise
there
that
the
population
deviations
in
this
case
are
so
minor
that
they
are
not
substantial
deviations
to
begin
with.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct,
on
1969
or
1970.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
because
of
the
smallest
of
the
numbers
involved
but
in
any
case,
i
take
the
second
step
and
say,
if
this
court
concludes
that
there
is
substantial
population
deviation
here
that
there
are
justifications
that
have
been
shown
for
this
variation.
and
that
therefore,
it
should
be
allowed
under
the
tests
it’s
been
applied.
and
that
was
the
format
that
was
used
in
swann
versus
adams
involving
florida
and
kilgarlin
versus
martin
in
texas
where
you
rejected
the
arguments
there
saying
that
the
populations
were
too
large
and
that
there
was
no
acceptable
justification
which
is
demonstrated
before.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
a
1%
deviation
for
example
on
a
congressional
level
which
involves
a
shift
of
about
4,000
people
when
you
talk
about
a
1%
deviation
on
a
local
level
involves
a
shift
of
approximately
here
a
121
people
gets
to
be
a
little
unrealistic.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
unquestionably.
i
think
on
a
congressional
level
that
municipal
boundary
lines
are
far
less
significant
that
they
are
for
example
in
new
york
where
historically
and
traditionally,
there
has
been
this
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
government.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
demonstrate
the
interrelationship
here,
the
plan
of
reapportionment
when
it
was
originally
devised
provided
that
the
town
chief
executive
officer
who
was
elected
within
the
town
would
be
one
of
the
legislators
within
that
town
automatically
and
that
he
would
serve
for
example
in
the
town
of
ramapo
which
has
six
legislators.
there
would
be
the
supervisor
of
the
town,
the
chief
executive
officer
plus
the
five
others
which
would
provide
for
very
direct
interrelationships
so
that
the
chief
executive
officer
on
the
town
would
still
continue
on
the
county
level.
the
court
in
new
york
rejected
that
and
said
that
the
statutes
did
not
permit
that
interrelationship.
therefore,
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
towns
must
run
separately
for
that
county
office.
in
other
words,
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
town
can
run
on
the
ballot
in
two
places.
one,
he
runs
as
a
legislator
and
secondly,
he
runs
as
a
town
supervisor
and
as
a
practical
matter,
in
rockland
county
today,
out
of
the
five
towns
four
of
them
have
their
chief
executive
officer
who
serves
on
the
town
level
and
is
also
elected
and
serves
on
the
county
level
as
well
and
one
of
the
towns
this
is
not
the
case.
so
that
this
plan
has
effectively
provided
for
this
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
government
which
is
what
is
attempted
to
do
being
also
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
reynolds
versus
sims.
you
see
what
happens
on
the
local
level
is
that
when
you
apply
the
rule
of
one
man,
one
vote
to
a
situation
like
this.
it
can
have
the
effect
if
you
set
up
single-member
districts
of
slicing
a
part
the
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
government
so
that
you
would
separate
the
operation
of
county
government
and
town
government.
and
it
was
our
attempt
to
comply
with
the
rule
but
at
the
same
time
to
apply
for
this
interrelationship.
and
that’s
exactly
what
was
done
here
in
rockland
county.
the
concept
of
tight
mathematical
equality
is
our
position
is
somewhat
unrealistic
when
you’re
dealing
with
populations
which
are
shifting
constantly
from
time
to
time.
it’s
true
even
in
the
situation
of
rockland
county
where
the
census
itself
is
not
a
scientific
ascertainment
of
the
number
of
people
involved
and
also
where
in
fact
there
is
a
constant
growth
and
a
constant
shift.
so
that
to
provide
for
a
very
tight
absolute
mathematical
equality
at
any
one
point
in
time,
seem
somewhat
illusory
because
within
a
few
months
or
a
year
thereafter
it
may
have
shifted
or
changed
so
that
in
fact
is
not
achieving
the
ultimate
goal.
the
flexibility
which
is
required
on
the
local
level
here
in
rockland
county
is
desirable
and
it
is
our
position
that
if
a
tight
mathematical
formulation
is
applied
on
the
local
level
that
it
may
create
difficulties
in
other
areas
where
there
is
attempts
perhaps
you
create
regional
governments
or
amalgamation
of
governments
on
a
regional
basis
between
some
of
the
cities
in
the
suburbs
and
that
there
you
may
have
a
necessity
for
compact
or
an
understanding
between
these
governments
to
arrive
at
a
regional
type
of
approach
of
the
government
and
if
you
apply
the
population,
the
equal
population
principle
with
strict
exactitude
on
the
local
level
this
may
have
the
effect
of
foreclosing
the
ability
to
create
any
type
of
regional
governmental
units
which
i
suggest
may
be
some
of
the
solution
to
the
problems
which
we’ve
had
in
the
cities
in
the
next
decades
ahead.
now
i’d
like
to
touch
briefly
on
multi-member
districts
from
the
theoretical
standpoint.
i
know
that
my
adversaries
have
not
raised
this
but
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
judge
fuld
does
touch
upon
this
point
in
his
dissent.
and
i
think
it’s
in
the
case
and
something
that
i
should
discuss
very
briefly.
this
court
has
of
course
upheld
multi-member
districts
on
a
number
of
occasions.
fortson
versus
dorsey
involving
georgia
was
one
of
the
earlier
cases.
burns
versus
richardson
involving
the
state
of
hawaii
and
then
there
have
been
a
number
of
affirmances
of
lower
courts
involving
wyoming,
arkansas,
and
of
course
recently
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
jackman
versus
bodine
which
i
think
you’re
familiar
with
provided
for
multi-member
districts
as
well.
it
is
our
position
that
the
use
of
multi-member
districts
is
a
constitutional
method
of
complying
with
the
one
man,
one
vote
requirement.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
there
was
no
testimony
at
all
your
honor.
the
plan
was
devised
by
the
board
of
supervisors
and
presented
to
the
court
and
the
court
passed
upon
it
based
upon
the
format
of
the
plan
without
any
testimony
being
taken.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
although
professor
banzhaf
who
wrote
the
leading
article
on
this
subject
did
argue
orally
for
the
petitioners
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york.
and
the
court
there
had
the
benefit
of
his
comments
before
them
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
not
other
than
what
was
set
forth
on
oral
argument.
there
was
no
expert
testimony
which
was
taken.
of
course,
in
this
case
there
is
no
problem
as
there
was
raised
in
some
of
the
multi-member
district
cases
and
the
one
which
will
be
coming
before
this
court
involving
indiana
of
invidious
discrimination.
so
that
does
not
involve
here
at
all.
so
that
the
only
question
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
our
multi-member
districts
per
se
bad
if
you
allocate
legislators
direct
proportion
of
population
rather
than
bringing
in
the
factor
of
the
square
root
of
the
population.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
there
have.
the
indiana
case
involved
this
question
and
in
the
indiana
decision
the
court
although
it
had
a
number
of
other
factors
involved
did
touch
upon
this
question
of
whether
multi-member
districts
were
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
iowa,
kruidenier
versus
mcculloch
struck
down
a
plan
which
did
provide
for
multi-member
districts.
this
is
not
--
this
case
is
not
cited
in
my
brief.
the
concurring
opinion
by
justice
stewart
in
the
case
touched
on
the
question
of
multi-member
districts
and
in
reading
the
opinion,
i
suspect
that
he
was
saying
although
i’m
not
clear
about
this,
i
suspect
that
he
was
saying
that
multi-member
districts
were
per
se
bad.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
based
upon
the
banzhaf
theory.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
those,
the
iowa
case
and
the
indian
case
are
the
ones,
of
course
the
new
jersey
case,
jackman
versus
bodine.
this
was
touched
on
but
there
the
plan
was
of
course
approved.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
i
don’t
your
honor
and
i’ve
made
inquiries
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
plan
that’s
been
drafted
or
in
the
contemplation
of
being
drafted
which
does
assign
less
done
a
direct
proportionate
number
of
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
here
on
this
theoretical
aspect
of
multi-member
districts
is
actually
covered
by
professor
banzhaf
in
his
law
review
article
which
i
have
in
front
of
me.
he
says
in
his
own
article
as
follows,
“no
attempt
has
been
made
to
evaluate
all
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
multi-member
district
systems.
furthermore,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
article
presents
a
realistic
picture
of
their
actual
operations
which
of
course
would
involve
the
factors
which
are
not
present
in
the
simple
mathematical
models.
and
i
think
the
problem
with
professor
banzhaf
theory
is
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
he
uses
a
square
root
factor.
he
would
say
for
example
if
i
understand
his
theory
correctly.
he
would
say
that
if
he
had
one
district
with
10,000
people
and
if
you
have
another
district
with
40,000
that
it
would
be
mathematically
improper
to
allocate
one
legislator
to
the
small
one
and
four
to
the
larger.
that
the
number
of
legislators
should
be
allocated
to
the
larger
district,
is
the
square
root
of
the
population
for
two
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
he
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
he
uses
a
mathematical
formula
to
arrive
at
it
and
i’ll
be
quite
candid,
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand
all
of
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
if
you
follow
his
arguments
logically,
it
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
possibility
is
a
single-member
district
plan
or
that
they
would
have
to
be
some
adjustment
in
a
number
of
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
i
think
the
problem
with
his
theory
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
the
problem
is
that
he
does
not
in
creating
these
mathematical
models
recognize
that
a
legislator
once
he
is
elected
from
a
district
takes
into
consideration
the
interests
of
the
entire
community.
he
may
be
affected
be
party
alliances.
he
may
be
affected
by
pressure
groups.
he
may
be
affected
by
what
he
thinks
is
right.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
i
don’t.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
reynolds
versus
sims
is
really
saying
that
what
is
required
is
effective
and
fair
representation.
and
that
the
ultimate
goal
and
the
ultimate
aim
is
to
provide
for
representation
by
the
ultimate
constituents
on
the
legislative
body
and
i
think
that
is
the
test
that
should
be
applied.
and
i
think
when
you
get
to
the
mathematical
refine
measure,
you’re
moving
away
from
the
general
premise
behind
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
if
you
followed
professor
banzhaf’s
theory
you
would
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
a
multi-member
district
plan
where
you
have
for
example
four
legislators
that
the
four
legislators
who
would
be
voting
on
a
block
vote
and
that
there
would
not
be
these
other
influences
involved.
this
distinguishes
the
situation
from
weighted
voting.
in
the
state
of
new
york,
there
are
at
approximately
18
counties
that
have
weighted
voting.
they
are
of
course
your
allocating
all
the
votes
to
one
individual
and
there
you
would
have
a
situation
analogous
to
block
voting
in
a
multi-member
district.
but
the
voting
power
on
the
legislative
level
in
a
multi-member
district,
in
this
case,
you
have
18
legislators.
even
though
five
may
come
from
one
district,
there
is
absolutely
no
assurance
that
you’re
ever
going
to
get
block
voting.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
normally
don’t
because
the
political
alliances
are
different
and
they
vote
them
on
a
party
line
as
opposed
to
voting
necessarily
from,
depending
upon
where
they
actually
resided.
so
that
i
think
that
the
use
of
multi-member
districts
is
a
valid
method
of
apportionment
and
that
you
cannot
say
per
se
based
upon
the
mathematical
models
that
have
been
developed
that
is
bar.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
this
may
be
true.
i
think
that
when
you’re
talking
about
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
concurring
opinion
in
this
iowa
case
that
i
mentioned
before,
judge
stewart
discussed
the
same
type
of
thing.
he
said,
isn’t
there’s
something
wrong
with
one
man
being
able
to
vote
for
13
people
and
another
man
being
able
to
only
vote
for
one.
now,
the
problem
with
that
theory
is
that
the
chap
is
only
voting
for
13
people
may
be
in
a
very
large
district.
so
he’s
only
one
out
of
a
multitude
of
other
people.
so
that
for
him
to
have
13
legislators
or
four
legislators
in
relation
to
total
population
of
the
component
district
which
he
is
a
part
really
is
not
giving
him
a
better
shape
than
the
other
chap
who
is
voting
for
one.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
county
actually
in
established
in
this
plan
of
reapportionment
appointed
a
reapportionment
commission
which
is
an
appointed
body
that
was
part
and
set
up
to
try
to
devise
the
best
plan.
i
presume
that
if
subsequent
censuses
showed
or
if
this
court
says
that
this
plan
is
no
good,
that
they
would
appoint
a
bipartisan
commission
again
to
come
up
with
a
new
plan
or
a
better
plan
or
just
to
carve
line
that
would
meet
the
test
that
it
will
be
laid
down
here.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
--
in
new
york,
the
interrelationship
of
town
and
county
government
is
the
thing
that
the
board
of
supervisors
was
the
most
concerned
about.
in
the
past,
before
reapportionment
came
in,
county
government
was
run
by
the
chief
executives
of
the
towns.
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
interrelationship
between
these
two
levels
of
government.
and
it
was
a
concern
of
the
board
of
supervisors
to
devise
this
plan
that
they
like
to
maintain
an
interrelationship
between
these
two
levels
of
government,
so
that
the
towns
would
have
a
voice
in
the
county
government
that’s
why
they
use
the
town
lines.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
it
in
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
in
new
york
where
there
is
this
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
governments
that
adherence
to
town
boundary
lines
is
a
justification
for
some
population
deviations.
and
this
may
not
be
trued
in
other
jurisdictions
where
this
is
the
case.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
wagner
versus
blaikie.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
case
is
cited
in
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case
below
although
i
have
a
feeling
this
citation
is
incorrect
because
i
couldn’t
find
it
this
morning.
but
it’s
in
that
case.
it’s
a
federal
supp
case,
yes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
case
is
quite
interesting
because
there,
there
was
in
the
districts
that
were
equal
population
then
on
top
of
that
were
two
representatives
from
the
bureaus
of
the
city
of
new
york.
the
court
held
that
there
was
not
such
a
deviation
from
population
there
and
that
the
reason
for
doing
this
because
of
the
inherent
value
of
the
barrels
was
a
valid
justification
for
providing
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct.
so
that
you
have,
i
have
forgotten
the
numbers
involved
but
you
have
two
from
each
barrel
plus
you
have
others
that
were
represented
from
single-member
districts
which
were
carved
out
within
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
believe
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
don’t
recall
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
cert
was
denied.
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
on
a
local
level
and
in
this
case,
the
importance
factor
in
my
mind
is
that
the
implementation
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
has
the
possible
effect
of
separating
talent
county
government
and
that
the
efforts
have
been
made
by
the
board
of
supervisors
to
maintain
this
interrelationship
which
we
feel
is
justified.
and
finally,
that
if
the
ultimate
test
is
fair
and
effective
representation,
is
set
forth
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
that
one
should
not
look
at
the
equal
population
principle
and
that
presented
deviations
which
are
found
has
the
ends
but
merely
a
means
to
actually
arriving
at
the
ultimate
goal
of
fair
and
effective
representation.
and
its
thorough
absolute-type
mathematical
analysis
of
population
deviations
may
in
fact
frustrate
the
situation
and
that
the
use
of
town
boundary
lines
in
this
case,
of
course
also
avoids
the
rather
practical
problems
of
gerrymandering.
that
will
not
occur
here
if
town
boundaries
are
hereto.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
issue
involve
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
numbers.
rockland
county
is
a
relatively
small
county
and
politically
it’s
a
swing
county.
it’s
sometimes
a
democratic
and
it’s
sometimes
as
republic.
the
board
of
supervisors
consisting
of
the
five
supervisors
originally
was
a
democratically
controlled
board
and
they
devise
this
plan
of
reapportionment
and
after
the
last
selection
of
the
board
became
or
the
new
legislative
body
became
republicans
so
that
politics
really
is
not
involved
in
this
case
since
it
swings
back
and
forth.
the
original
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
in
the
case
at
all,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
the
original
board
of
supervisors
felt
that
it
was
important
to
maintain
a
voice
on
the
county
level
of
government
from
the
towns
and
that’s
what
brought
about
this
type
of
multi-member
district
plan
and
that’s
really
the
only
thing
that’s
involved
here.
also,
it
was
felt
that
there
were
certain
towns
like
the
smallest
town,
town
of
stony
point
that
was
somewhat
isolated
from
the
other
towns
which
are
large
and
they
wanted
to
have
a
voice
of
their
own.
they
didn’t
want
to
be
amalgamated
with
a
not
a
larger
area
and
perhaps
ease
that
type
of
identity
which
that
community
had
had
over
the
many
years.
so
what
we’re
talking
about
really
is
numbers
here.
it
is
our
position
that
the
plan
which
was
devise
complies
with
the
rule
which
was
set
down
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
apply
to
local
governments
in
avery
versus
midland
county
which
requires
that
the
population
be
substantially
equal
or
in
other
terms
as
was
used
that
as
nearly
as
practical
--
practicable
the
district’s
view
of
equal
population
and
we
feel
that
we
have
actually
met
that
test.
now,
i
am
set
forth
in
appendix
a-2
of
my
brief
a
complete
breakdown
of
how
these
figures
operate
and
at
the
present
time,
based
upon
the
1969
census,
the
population
variation
which
is
the
largest
is
in
the
town
of
orangetown
where
the
deviation
is
7.1%
underrepresented
and
then
the
town
of
clarkstown
that’s
4.8%
overrepresented
making
a
spread
of
11.9%
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest.
now
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
as
of
1970
and
these
figures
are
not
before
the
court
because
these
figures
are
very
recent,
the
1970
census
has
reduced
these
population
disparity
so
that
the
town
of
orangetown
which
did
have
a
7.1%
under
representation,
now
is
underrepresented
by
4.7%.
the
town
of
clarkstown
which
had
a
4.8%
variation
now
has
a
3.2%
variation.
the
town
of
ramapo
has
a
0%
deviation
that
hits
it
right
on
the
nose.
haverstraw
has
a
0.8%
variation
at
the
present
time
and
that
the
town
of
stony
point,
it
changes
from
0.3%
to
1.1%.
now,
the
spread
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
now
is
7.9%
so
that
the
deviation
between
these
two
smallest
and
largest
of
7.1%.
now
in
terms
of
absolute
population,
this
amounts
to
1,017
people.
if
you
take
the
town
--
orangetown
which
has
a
deviation
of
4.7%
to
bring
that
into
line,
you
would
have
to
shift
the
lines
around
some
400
or
500
people
which
we
feel
is
unrealistic
because
in
fact
it
means
that
you
may
have
to
cut
a
district
line
down
somebody’s
backyard
of
even
to
an
apartment
building
to
pick
up
that
number
of
people.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
factors
that’s
extremely
important
here
is
to
recognize
that
when
you
talk
about
percentage
deviations,
you
must
consider
the
size
of
the
district
which
is
involved.
now
for
example
in
wells
versus
rockefeller
involving
the
state
of
new
york
which
was
approved
by
this
court
in
may,
the
new
districting
plan
on
the
congressional
level.
the
average
population
for
the
congressional
district
in
new
york
which
is
approved
was
490,324.
now
1%
deviation
in
the
congressional
district
would
amount
to
an
absolute
population
of
4,000,
a
little
over
4,000
people.
now,
it’s
one
thing
to
shift
to
district
lines
around
to
pick
up
or
exclude
4,000
people.
but
a
1%
deviation
in
rockland
county
amounts
to
1%
of
the
main
population
of
12,000
or
approximately
a
121
people.
and
it
is
impractical
and
unrealistic
to
consider
a
necessity
of
shifting
or
moving
lines
or
adjusting
legislators
to
pick
up
or
exclude
a
121
people
to
provide
for
1%
deviation
of
more.
therefore,
it
is
our
position
that
you
must
look
at
the
size
of
the
district
in
relation
to
an
analysis
of
percentage
deviations
so
that
it
can
be
a
practical
application
of
rule.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
question
which
was
raised
in
the
hadley
case
involving
the
trustees
in
the
community
college
which
was
not
approve
by
this
court
was
a
different
type
of
situation.
there
you
had
a
built-in
bias
in
favor
of
the
smaller
districts.
there
were
six
trustees
that
were
elected
and
the
larger
district
would
only
get
three
trustees
if
they
were
from
50%
to
60%
of
the
school
enumeration
in
that
case.
and
this
court
said
in
that
case
that
you
are
not
reaching
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
equal
apportionment
of
trustees
among
a
limited
number
of
component
districts.
and
you
stated
that
he
have
said
before
that
mathematical
exactitude
is
not
required
but
a
plan
that
does
not
automatically
discriminate
in
favor
or
certain
districts
is
and
in
that
case,
that’s
exactly
what
there
was.
there
was
a
built-in
bias
and
an
automatic
discrimination
against
the
larger
districts.
there’s
a
built-in
bias
in
favor
of
the
smaller
districts.
that
problem
is
not
found
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
merely
have
a
situation
where
there
were
equal
member
districts
--
multi-member
districts
and
there
is
no
built-in
bias
that’s
in
favor
of
the
smaller
or
the
larger
districts.
there
was
reliance
by
the
petitioner
here
upon
kirkpatrick
versus
preisler
and
wells
versus
rockefeller.
these
were
both
congressional
cases
and
in
the
wells
versus
rockefeller
case,
there
was
a
rejection
of
a
maximum
population
spread
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
of
approximately
13%.
in
the
kirkpatrick
case
involving
the
congressional
districts
in
missouri,
there
was
a
rejection
of
a
spread
of
approximately
6%
between
the
highest
and
lowest.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
you
cannot
on
a
wholesale
basis
take
these
percentage
deviations
that
may
not
be
acceptable
on
a
congressional
level
and
transpose
them
down
onto
smaller
districts
where
there
is
smaller
populations
involved.
also,
i
think
the
facts
in
both
of
those
cases
are
distinguishable.
in
wells
versus
rockefeller,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
state
of
new
york
admitted
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
provide
equal
population
for
sub-districts
and
that
the
congressional
districts
were
then
carved
out
of
these
regional
districts
within
the
state
and
the
record
shows
that
the
state
admits
that
there
was
not
an
effort
really
to
fine
home
the
district
lines
on
the
congressional
level.
in
the
missouri
case,
there
are
also
indications
that,
number
one
there
was
not
a
proper
census
data
that
was
made
for
determining
the
district
lines.
and
also
there
is
a
clear
admission
in
that
case,
that
merely
by
shifting
several
counties
around
that
they
could
have
provided
for
a
more
equal
population
in
those
congressional
districts.
we
don’t
have
that
situation
in
this
case
at
all.
the
town
lines
have
been
used
as
the
district
lines
and
the
legislators
have
been
allocated
to
the
towns
in
accordance
with
the
population
and
as
i
say
the
population
deviation
is
extremely
minimal
and
there
is
no
way
that
you
could
arrive
at
a
lesser
population
deviation
if
you
would
hear
the
town
lines.
this
is
the
only
way
that
it
can
be
done.
now,
chief
judge
fuld
in
the
court
of
appeals
dissented.
and
he
asked
me
when
i
argued
that
case
off
the
bench
whether
i
wasn’t
concerned
about
the
future
population
changes
and
whether
or
not
this
plan
might
depending
upon
how
the
figures
came
out
subsequently
result
in
a
more
substantial
deviation.
before
i
had
a
chance
to
answer
the
question,
judge
breitel
said
yes
but
the
figures
might
get
better.
and
that’s
exactly
what
happened
here.
so
i
think
that
the
argument
that
he
relies
upon
his
dissent
has
been
undercut
by
what
actually
has
happened
here.
any
plan
whether
it’s
a
single-member
district
plan
or
a
multi-member
district
plan
as
soon
as
the
population
changes
whether
it
be
the
next
year
or
thereafter,
there
may
have
to
be
some
adjustment
to
account
for
the
changes
in
population.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
the
population
figures
that
resulted
in
1970
improved
the
situations,
so
the
population
deviation
now
is
as
low
as
i
mentioned
before
7.9%.
so
i
think
the
reasoning
that
judge
fuld
set
forth
in
his
dissenting
opinion
cannot
be
upheld
based
upon
actually
what
happened.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
for
purposes
of
securing
additional
state
aid
on
a
local
level,
it’s
frequently
is
advisable
if
a
population
and
a
growing
to
have
a
census
taken
to
determine
what
the
population
is.
they
do
it
every
three
years.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
it’s
done
by
the
bureau
of
census
in
washington.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
federal
bureau
of
census.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely,
if
the
population
figure
show
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
it’s
true
of
any
plan.
it’s
true
of
a
single-member
district
plan,
you
have
to
re-draw
district
plans
and
in
a
multi-member
district
plan,
if
you
have
this
problem,
you
might
then
consider
the
possibility
if
there
was
substantial
deviations
of
providing
for
fractional
vote
that
would
be
spread
among
those
legislators.
it’s
just
a
possibility
but
there
are
number
of
things
that
could
be
done.
but
any
case,
if
there
was
a
population
change,
and
if
the
deviation
was
substantial
then
of
course
the
then
legislation
would
have
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
rectify
that
deviation.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
the
people
of
rockland
county
had
two
referendums.
initially,
they
had
a
referendum
on
a
plan
which
is
almost
identical
with
this
plan
and
they
rejected
it.
about
seven
months
later,
there
was
a
second
referendum
that
had
this
plan
plus
a
single-member
district
plan
which
is
the
plan
which
the
petitioners
were
asking
for
and
the
voters
rejected
both
of
those.
then
the
court
was
asked
on
a
temporary
basis
to
impose
a
weighted
voting
plan
until
a
permanent
plan
could
be
devised
because
the
voters
kept
rejecting
everything
that
was
presented
to
them.
the
court
said
no
that
they
felt
it
a
weighted
voting
plan
in
this
county
was
not
feasible
and
i
agree
with
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
reason
is
that
rockland
county
if
it’s
analyzed
mathematically,
the
larger
towns
because
of
their
size
would
be
in
a
position
to
nullify
any
vote
or
any
vote
that
would
be
accorded
to
the
smaller
town
because
it
is
such
a
small
town.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
because
here
you
have
multi-member
districts
whereby
you
have
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
but
you
have
18
bodies
on
the
legislature.
if
you
had
one
body
with
six
votes,
unless
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
way
the
plan
would
function
would
be
that
you
would
always
give
one
legislator
to
the
smallest
town.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
no.
actually,
the
way
i
devise
this
plan
was
that
you
start
off
by
giving
the
smallest
town
one
representative.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
and
then
you
divide
the
population
of
the
smallest
town
into
the
others
to
generate
the
proper
number
of
legislator’s
fee
of
the
town.
so
that
what
fluctuates
is
the
number
of
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
if
it
did,
of
course
it
had
to
change
the
plan.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
correct.
in
other
words,
some
mechanism
would
have
to
be
devised
to
provide
for
that
deviation.
i
think
it’s
important
in
this
reapportionment
case
to
recognize
what’s
involved
here
between
town
and
county
government
because
this
is
really
the
stimulus
for
this
type
of
plan.
in
the
state
of
new
york,
county
governments
in
the
past
have
been
run
by
the
supervisors
who
are
the
chief
executive
officers
in
the
towns
within
the
county.
there
was
never
any
legislative
body
on
the
county
level
that
was
directly
elected.
the
town
selected
a
chief
executive
officer
who
served
on
the
county
border
supervisors
and
actually
an
ex-officio
capacity
and
would
run
the
county
government.
therefore,
the
towns
had
a
direct
voice
in
the
operation
of
county
government.
and
on
the
county
level,
there
are
a
number
of
functions
of
county
government
which
can
also
be
performed
on
the
town
level.
and
the
desirability
of
having
an
interrelationship
between
a
town
and
county
government,
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
supervisors
was
to
provide
for
the
conduct
of
business
on
this
countywide
basis
so
that
there
would
be
an
interrelationship
between
the
operation
of
both
county
and
town
government.
for
example,
there
is
a
large
county
sewer
district
in
the
county
of
rockland
which
has
a
sewer
plant
and
sewer
lines
which
ties
indirectly
with
lateral
lines
in
the
towns
so
that
this
function
of
providing
sewer
service
is
directly
interrelated
between
town
and
county
government.
the
county
has
a
civil
service
department
which
administers
the
civil
service
on
the
town
level.
there
is
a
very
direct
physical
interrelationship
between
the
town
and
county
governments.
the
towns
assess
the
real
property.
the
towns
adopt
their
budget
and
then
the
towns
transmit
the
amount
of
money
to
be
raised
by
taxes
to
the
county
level
and
the
county
legislature
then
levies
the
tax
and
directs
the
town
receiver
of
taxes
to
collect
the
tax.
and
then
if
their
moneys
are
not
paid
as
required
it
is
then
sent
back
to
the
county
to
collect
the
delinquent
taxes
so
that
this
is
a
very
direct
type
or
interrelationship
between
the
town
and
county
government
which
has
grown
up
historically
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
my
position
is
that
the
test
of
substantial
equality
applies
on
the
local
level
and
that
the
equal
protection
clause
must
apply
on
the
congressional
state
and
local
level.
but
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely,
it’s
the
same
test
but
when
you
ascertain
whether
there
has
been
substantial
equality
or
not,
you
must
look
at
the
numbers
--
the
figures
that
you’re
dealing
with.
now,
for
example,
in
the
kirkpatrick
case,
this
court
said
the
whole
thrust
of
as
nearly
as
practical
approach
is
inconsistent
with
the
adoption
of
the
fixed
numerical
standard
which
excuses
population
variances
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
i’m
also
taking
the
initial
premise
there
that
the
population
deviations
in
this
case
are
so
minor
that
they
are
not
substantial
deviations
to
begin
with.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct,
on
1969
or
1970.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
because
of
the
smallest
of
the
numbers
involved
but
in
any
case,
i
take
the
second
step
and
say,
if
this
court
concludes
that
there
is
substantial
population
deviation
here
that
there
are
justifications
that
have
been
shown
for
this
variation.
and
that
therefore,
it
should
be
allowed
under
the
tests
it’s
been
applied.
and
that
was
the
format
that
was
used
in
swann
versus
adams
involving
florida
and
kilgarlin
versus
martin
in
texas
where
you
rejected
the
arguments
there
saying
that
the
populations
were
too
large
and
that
there
was
no
acceptable
justification
which
is
demonstrated
before.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
a
1%
deviation
for
example
on
a
congressional
level
which
involves
a
shift
of
about
4,000
people
when
you
talk
about
a
1%
deviation
on
a
local
level
involves
a
shift
of
approximately
here
a
121
people
gets
to
be
a
little
unrealistic.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
unquestionably.
i
think
on
a
congressional
level
that
municipal
boundary
lines
are
far
less
significant
that
they
are
for
example
in
new
york
where
historically
and
traditionally,
there
has
been
this
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
government.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
demonstrate
the
interrelationship
here,
the
plan
of
reapportionment
when
it
was
originally
devised
provided
that
the
town
chief
executive
officer
who
was
elected
within
the
town
would
be
one
of
the
legislators
within
that
town
automatically
and
that
he
would
serve
for
example
in
the
town
of
ramapo
which
has
six
legislators.
there
would
be
the
supervisor
of
the
town,
the
chief
executive
officer
plus
the
five
others
which
would
provide
for
very
direct
interrelationships
so
that
the
chief
executive
officer
on
the
town
would
still
continue
on
the
county
level.
the
court
in
new
york
rejected
that
and
said
that
the
statutes
did
not
permit
that
interrelationship.
therefore,
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
towns
must
run
separately
for
that
county
office.
in
other
words,
the
chief
executive
officer
in
the
town
can
run
on
the
ballot
in
two
places.
one,
he
runs
as
a
legislator
and
secondly,
he
runs
as
a
town
supervisor
and
as
a
practical
matter,
in
rockland
county
today,
out
of
the
five
towns
four
of
them
have
their
chief
executive
officer
who
serves
on
the
town
level
and
is
also
elected
and
serves
on
the
county
level
as
well
and
one
of
the
towns
this
is
not
the
case.
so
that
this
plan
has
effectively
provided
for
this
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
government
which
is
what
is
attempted
to
do
being
also
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
reynolds
versus
sims.
you
see
what
happens
on
the
local
level
is
that
when
you
apply
the
rule
of
one
man,
one
vote
to
a
situation
like
this.
it
can
have
the
effect
if
you
set
up
single-member
districts
of
slicing
a
part
the
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
government
so
that
you
would
separate
the
operation
of
county
government
and
town
government.
and
it
was
our
attempt
to
comply
with
the
rule
but
at
the
same
time
to
apply
for
this
interrelationship.
and
that’s
exactly
what
was
done
here
in
rockland
county.
the
concept
of
tight
mathematical
equality
is
our
position
is
somewhat
unrealistic
when
you’re
dealing
with
populations
which
are
shifting
constantly
from
time
to
time.
it’s
true
even
in
the
situation
of
rockland
county
where
the
census
itself
is
not
a
scientific
ascertainment
of
the
number
of
people
involved
and
also
where
in
fact
there
is
a
constant
growth
and
a
constant
shift.
so
that
to
provide
for
a
very
tight
absolute
mathematical
equality
at
any
one
point
in
time,
seem
somewhat
illusory
because
within
a
few
months
or
a
year
thereafter
it
may
have
shifted
or
changed
so
that
in
fact
is
not
achieving
the
ultimate
goal.
the
flexibility
which
is
required
on
the
local
level
here
in
rockland
county
is
desirable
and
it
is
our
position
that
if
a
tight
mathematical
formulation
is
applied
on
the
local
level
that
it
may
create
difficulties
in
other
areas
where
there
is
attempts
perhaps
you
create
regional
governments
or
amalgamation
of
governments
on
a
regional
basis
between
some
of
the
cities
in
the
suburbs
and
that
there
you
may
have
a
necessity
for
compact
or
an
understanding
between
these
governments
to
arrive
at
a
regional
type
of
approach
of
the
government
and
if
you
apply
the
population,
the
equal
population
principle
with
strict
exactitude
on
the
local
level
this
may
have
the
effect
of
foreclosing
the
ability
to
create
any
type
of
regional
governmental
units
which
i
suggest
may
be
some
of
the
solution
to
the
problems
which
we’ve
had
in
the
cities
in
the
next
decades
ahead.
now
i’d
like
to
touch
briefly
on
multi-member
districts
from
the
theoretical
standpoint.
i
know
that
my
adversaries
have
not
raised
this
but
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
judge
fuld
does
touch
upon
this
point
in
his
dissent.
and
i
think
it’s
in
the
case
and
something
that
i
should
discuss
very
briefly.
this
court
has
of
course
upheld
multi-member
districts
on
a
number
of
occasions.
fortson
versus
dorsey
involving
georgia
was
one
of
the
earlier
cases.
burns
versus
richardson
involving
the
state
of
hawaii
and
then
there
have
been
a
number
of
affirmances
of
lower
courts
involving
wyoming,
arkansas,
and
of
course
recently
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
jackman
versus
bodine
which
i
think
you’re
familiar
with
provided
for
multi-member
districts
as
well.
it
is
our
position
that
the
use
of
multi-member
districts
is
a
constitutional
method
of
complying
with
the
one
man,
one
vote
requirement.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
there
was
no
testimony
at
all
your
honor.
the
plan
was
devised
by
the
board
of
supervisors
and
presented
to
the
court
and
the
court
passed
upon
it
based
upon
the
format
of
the
plan
without
any
testimony
being
taken.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
although
professor
banzhaf
who
wrote
the
leading
article
on
this
subject
did
argue
orally
for
the
petitioners
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york.
and
the
court
there
had
the
benefit
of
his
comments
before
them
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
not
other
than
what
was
set
forth
on
oral
argument.
there
was
no
expert
testimony
which
was
taken.
of
course,
in
this
case
there
is
no
problem
as
there
was
raised
in
some
of
the
multi-member
district
cases
and
the
one
which
will
be
coming
before
this
court
involving
indiana
of
invidious
discrimination.
so
that
does
not
involve
here
at
all.
so
that
the
only
question
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
our
multi-member
districts
per
se
bad
if
you
allocate
legislators
direct
proportion
of
population
rather
than
bringing
in
the
factor
of
the
square
root
of
the
population.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
there
have.
the
indiana
case
involved
this
question
and
in
the
indiana
decision
the
court
although
it
had
a
number
of
other
factors
involved
did
touch
upon
this
question
of
whether
multi-member
districts
were
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
iowa,
kruidenier
versus
mcculloch
struck
down
a
plan
which
did
provide
for
multi-member
districts.
this
is
not
--
this
case
is
not
cited
in
my
brief.
the
concurring
opinion
by
justice
stewart
in
the
case
touched
on
the
question
of
multi-member
districts
and
in
reading
the
opinion,
i
suspect
that
he
was
saying
although
i’m
not
clear
about
this,
i
suspect
that
he
was
saying
that
multi-member
districts
were
per
se
bad.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
based
upon
the
banzhaf
theory.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
those,
the
iowa
case
and
the
indian
case
are
the
ones,
of
course
the
new
jersey
case,
jackman
versus
bodine.
this
was
touched
on
but
there
the
plan
was
of
course
approved.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
i
don’t
your
honor
and
i’ve
made
inquiries
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
plan
that’s
been
drafted
or
in
the
contemplation
of
being
drafted
which
does
assign
less
done
a
direct
proportionate
number
of
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
here
on
this
theoretical
aspect
of
multi-member
districts
is
actually
covered
by
professor
banzhaf
in
his
law
review
article
which
i
have
in
front
of
me.
he
says
in
his
own
article
as
follows,
“no
attempt
has
been
made
to
evaluate
all
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
multi-member
district
systems.
furthermore,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
article
presents
a
realistic
picture
of
their
actual
operations
which
of
course
would
involve
the
factors
which
are
not
present
in
the
simple
mathematical
models.
and
i
think
the
problem
with
professor
banzhaf
theory
is
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
he
uses
a
square
root
factor.
he
would
say
for
example
if
i
understand
his
theory
correctly.
he
would
say
that
if
he
had
one
district
with
10,000
people
and
if
you
have
another
district
with
40,000
that
it
would
be
mathematically
improper
to
allocate
one
legislator
to
the
small
one
and
four
to
the
larger.
that
the
number
of
legislators
should
be
allocated
to
the
larger
district,
is
the
square
root
of
the
population
for
two
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
he
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
he
uses
a
mathematical
formula
to
arrive
at
it
and
i’ll
be
quite
candid,
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand
all
of
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
if
you
follow
his
arguments
logically,
it
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
possibility
is
a
single-member
district
plan
or
that
they
would
have
to
be
some
adjustment
in
a
number
of
legislators.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
i
think
the
problem
with
his
theory
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
the
problem
is
that
he
does
not
in
creating
these
mathematical
models
recognize
that
a
legislator
once
he
is
elected
from
a
district
takes
into
consideration
the
interests
of
the
entire
community.
he
may
be
affected
be
party
alliances.
he
may
be
affected
by
pressure
groups.
he
may
be
affected
by
what
he
thinks
is
right.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
i
don’t.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
reynolds
versus
sims
is
really
saying
that
what
is
required
is
effective
and
fair
representation.
and
that
the
ultimate
goal
and
the
ultimate
aim
is
to
provide
for
representation
by
the
ultimate
constituents
on
the
legislative
body
and
i
think
that
is
the
test
that
should
be
applied.
and
i
think
when
you
get
to
the
mathematical
refine
measure,
you’re
moving
away
from
the
general
premise
behind
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
if
you
followed
professor
banzhaf’s
theory
you
would
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
a
multi-member
district
plan
where
you
have
for
example
four
legislators
that
the
four
legislators
who
would
be
voting
on
a
block
vote
and
that
there
would
not
be
these
other
influences
involved.
this
distinguishes
the
situation
from
weighted
voting.
in
the
state
of
new
york,
there
are
at
approximately
18
counties
that
have
weighted
voting.
they
are
of
course
your
allocating
all
the
votes
to
one
individual
and
there
you
would
have
a
situation
analogous
to
block
voting
in
a
multi-member
district.
but
the
voting
power
on
the
legislative
level
in
a
multi-member
district,
in
this
case,
you
have
18
legislators.
even
though
five
may
come
from
one
district,
there
is
absolutely
no
assurance
that
you’re
ever
going
to
get
block
voting.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
normally
don’t
because
the
political
alliances
are
different
and
they
vote
them
on
a
party
line
as
opposed
to
voting
necessarily
from,
depending
upon
where
they
actually
resided.
so
that
i
think
that
the
use
of
multi-member
districts
is
a
valid
method
of
apportionment
and
that
you
cannot
say
per
se
based
upon
the
mathematical
models
that
have
been
developed
that
is
bar.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
this
may
be
true.
i
think
that
when
you’re
talking
about
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
concurring
opinion
in
this
iowa
case
that
i
mentioned
before,
judge
stewart
discussed
the
same
type
of
thing.
he
said,
isn’t
there’s
something
wrong
with
one
man
being
able
to
vote
for
13
people
and
another
man
being
able
to
only
vote
for
one.
now,
the
problem
with
that
theory
is
that
the
chap
is
only
voting
for
13
people
may
be
in
a
very
large
district.
so
he’s
only
one
out
of
a
multitude
of
other
people.
so
that
for
him
to
have
13
legislators
or
four
legislators
in
relation
to
total
population
of
the
component
district
which
he
is
a
part
really
is
not
giving
him
a
better
shape
than
the
other
chap
who
is
voting
for
one.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
county
actually
in
established
in
this
plan
of
reapportionment
appointed
a
reapportionment
commission
which
is
an
appointed
body
that
was
part
and
set
up
to
try
to
devise
the
best
plan.
i
presume
that
if
subsequent
censuses
showed
or
if
this
court
says
that
this
plan
is
no
good,
that
they
would
appoint
a
bipartisan
commission
again
to
come
up
with
a
new
plan
or
a
better
plan
or
just
to
carve
line
that
would
meet
the
test
that
it
will
be
laid
down
here.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
the
--
in
new
york,
the
interrelationship
of
town
and
county
government
is
the
thing
that
the
board
of
supervisors
was
the
most
concerned
about.
in
the
past,
before
reapportionment
came
in,
county
government
was
run
by
the
chief
executives
of
the
towns.
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
interrelationship
between
these
two
levels
of
government.
and
it
was
a
concern
of
the
board
of
supervisors
to
devise
this
plan
that
they
like
to
maintain
an
interrelationship
between
these
two
levels
of
government,
so
that
the
towns
would
have
a
voice
in
the
county
government
that’s
why
they
use
the
town
lines.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
precisely.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
well,
it
in
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
in
new
york
where
there
is
this
interrelationship
between
town
and
county
governments
that
adherence
to
town
boundary
lines
is
a
justification
for
some
population
deviations.
and
this
may
not
be
trued
in
other
jurisdictions
where
this
is
the
case.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
wagner
versus
blaikie.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
case
is
cited
in
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case
below
although
i
have
a
feeling
this
citation
is
incorrect
because
i
couldn’t
find
it
this
morning.
but
it’s
in
that
case.
it’s
a
federal
supp
case,
yes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
case
is
quite
interesting
because
there,
there
was
in
the
districts
that
were
equal
population
then
on
top
of
that
were
two
representatives
from
the
bureaus
of
the
city
of
new
york.
the
court
held
that
there
was
not
such
a
deviation
from
population
there
and
that
the
reason
for
doing
this
because
of
the
inherent
value
of
the
barrels
was
a
valid
justification
for
providing
--
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
that
is
correct.
so
that
you
have,
i
have
forgotten
the
numbers
involved
but
you
have
two
from
each
barrel
plus
you
have
others
that
were
represented
from
single-member
districts
which
were
carved
out
within
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
believe
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
don’t
recall
your
honor.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
i
think
cert
was
denied.
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
j.
martin
cornell
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
on
a
local
level
and
in
this
case,
the
importance
factor
in
my
mind
is
that
the
implementation
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
has
the
possible
effect
of
separating
talent
county
government
and
that
the
efforts
have
been
made
by
the
board
of
supervisors
to
maintain
this
interrelationship
which
we
feel
is
justified.
and
finally,
that
if
the
ultimate
test
is
fair
and
effective
representation,
is
set
forth
in
reynolds
versus
sims,
that
one
should
not
look
at
the
equal
population
principle
and
that
presented
deviations
which
are
found
has
the
ends
but
merely
a
means
to
actually
arriving
at
the
ultimate
goal
of
fair
and
effective
representation.
and
its
thorough
absolute-type
mathematical
analysis
of
population
deviations
may
in
fact
frustrate
the
situation
and
that
the
use
of
town
boundary
lines
in
this
case,
of
course
also
avoids
the
rather
practical
problems
of
gerrymandering.
that
will
not
occur
here
if
town
boundaries
are
hereto.
thank
you
your
honor.
