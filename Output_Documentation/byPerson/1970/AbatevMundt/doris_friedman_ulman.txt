ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
clarify
a
few
points
that
were
just
--
that
have
just
been
made.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
about
multi-member
districts
for
rockland
county.
we
believe
that
we
--
it
is
possible
to
have
multi-member
districts
in
rockland
county
provided
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
not
using
town
lines
and
not
using
static
boundaries.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
secondly,
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
a
static
boundary
is
which
is
not
subject
to
change.
in
other
words,
the
reasons
for
the
present
plan
are
to
retain
town
boundaries
because
of
the
interrelationship
between
county
and
town
government.
now,
because
of
this,
the
boundary
lines
could
not
change.
they
would
have
to
remain
the
same
throughout
the
whole
plan.
otherwise,
you
would
not
have
your
county
rep
--
your
town
representation
on
the
county
level.
and
what
we
mean
by
static
boundaries
is
that
these
boundary
lines
can
never
change.
whereas,
the
population
within
each
town
will
be
changing
and
incidentally,
the
projected
figures
for
1980,
i
believe
were
about
300,000
for
the
county.
mr.
cornell
in
his
brief
projected,
i
believe
to
370,000
by
1985.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
well,
we
have
in
our
brief
set
forth
the
percentage
deviations
that
would
have
occurred.
if
this
plan
had
been
in
effect
since
1950,
and
they
were
six
federal
census
taken
between
1950
and
1969,
of
those
six
years,
four
--
during
four
of
those
years,
we
would
have
reached
a
deviation
in
excess
of
20%.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
recently
as
1966,
we
would
have
had
a
deviation
of
26%
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
population
for
legislator.
under
the
present
multi-member
plan
carried
to
it
its
extreme,
if
we
follow
the
planning
board
projections
for
1980
of
300,000
we
will
have
a
deviation
of
52%.
and
if
i
may
refer
to
a
footnote
in
the
dissent
of
chief
judge
fuld
of
the
court
of
appeals,
he
said
in
example
in
where
we
could
have
a
difference
of
99.96%.
i’m
not
saying
it’s
going
to
go
to
99%.
but
i
do
say
that
at
any
given
point,
and
the
census
are
taking
regularly
in
rockland
right
now.
because
of
its
excessive
growth,
that
at
any
point
the
deviation
could
be
6%,
it
could
be
50%
and
we
do
not
believe
that
a
plan
that
has
this
kind
of
possibility
for
huge
disparities
should
be
--
should
be
accepted
as
a
permanent
plan
of
reapportionment
because
truthfully,
if
next
year
it
goes
up
to
25%,
we’ll
be
in
court
again.
and
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
good
basis,
a
sound
basis
for
a
permanently
apportionment
plan.
we’re
not
claiming
that
multi
--
that
all
multi-member
district
plans
are
unconstitutional.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes?
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes,
it
is.
that’s
how
we
get
our
discrepancies.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
i
don’t
think
we
presented
that
argument
here.
what
we
did
say
was
that
because
we
are
faced
with
the
base
population
being
the
size
of
the
smallest
town,
in
this
case
the
only
point.
each
town
being
a
multiple
of
that
number
brings
us
to
our
deviation.
in
other
words
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
we
cannot
accept
the
--
we
cannot
accept
it
as
a
permanent
plan.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
the
static
boundaries.
number
two,
we
do
not
believe
the
good-faith
effort
has
been
made.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
we
do
not.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
we
do
not.
we
only
object
to
it
as
it
applies
to
rockland
county.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
i
do
not.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
i
do
not.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
it
was
made
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
not
made
here,
right.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
county
of
rockland
has
made
a
good
faith-effort
to
achieve
the
precise
mathematical
equality
which
was
required
by
this
court
in
kirkpatrick
against
preisler.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we
argue
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we’re
not
arguing
this
case
on
the
basis
of
numbers.
we’re
arguing
it
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
that’s
correct.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
for
the
fact
that
reynolds
said
that
population
should
be
the
controlling
factor
in
deciding
a
reapportionment
plan.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
well,
basic
--
right,
for
this
year
it
would
be
an
equal
plan.
next
year,
it
might
not
which
is
the
--
this
is
the
basis
of
our
argument
that
whereas
today,
we
may
have
a
0.5%
deviation
and
it
might
pass
master
under
the
plan,
under
the
cases.
however,
by
the
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
that’s
correct.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
as
i
know
it
has
--
we’ve
had
weighted
voting
which
was
rejected
by
the
lower
court
as
it
applies
to
rockland.
we
have
never
had
any
other
plan.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
i
do
not.
i
reject
it.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
believe
that
for
rockland,
because
of
its
size,
because
of
its
growth,
a
single-member
plan
is
the
only
plan
that
can
be
valid
representative
and
practical.
i
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
well,
they
have
had
a
man
there.
right.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
would
have
a
vote.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
and
actually
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we
do
not
feel
that
rockland
is
capable
of
having
equal
representation
without
single-member
districts.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
it
is
permanent
subject
to
changes
of
district
lines
as
population
changes.
even
a
single-member
district
plan
will
not
--
you
won’t
have
the
same
districts
year
after
year.
however,
because
they
are
not
static
lines,
you
can
shift
your
lines
so
as
to
take
care
of
the
population
increases
or
shifts
or
whatever
they
may
be.
another
advantage
of
single-member
districts
of
course
is
that
the
legislature
would
not
become
unwieldy
as
it
can
under
this
multi-member
plan.
assuming
that
the
population
of
stony
point
for
example
were
to
remain
fairly
static,
and
the
population
of
ramapo
which
is
our
largest
town
continues
to
increase.
we
can
have
as
many
as
20-25
even
more
legislators
in
a
county,
the
size
of
rockland
and
we
don’t
think
that
would
make
a
very
workable
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
practical
matter,
many
people
feel
that
the
present
18
that
we
have
is
not
very
workable,
too
large.
basically,
we
don’t
think
that
the
county
made
good-faith
effort
because
they
accepted
as
their
basic
premise
the
fact
that
they
should
be
town
representation
on
the
county
level.
because
of
that,
we
have
the
town
boundary
lines.
the
towns
and
the
county
of
course
do
have
interrelated
functions.
however,
the
plan
itself
does
not
provide
for
town
representation
on
the
county
level.
people
who
are
elected
within
the
towns
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
town
government.
they
are
in
effect
representing
the
people
within
their
district
as
a
single-member
district
legislator
would.
the
only
one
who
would
have
liaison
of
course
is
the
town
supervisor
who
may
be
elected
to
the
county
legislature.
but
it’s
only
one
vote
out
of
18
and
he
really
does
not
have
the
ability
to
influence
legislation
without
one
vote
with
regard
to
his
town.
furthermore,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
need
for
town
representation
on
the
county
level.
rockland
is
no
longer
a
small
rural
community.
it
has
grown
from
a
137,000
in
1960
to,
i
believe
228,000
in
1970.
it
has
--
it
offers
services
in
the
area
of
air
and
water
pollution
now,
mental
health
welfare
help,
and
so
on.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
originally,
when
this
plan
was
put
forth
it
was
created
by
the
board
of
supervisors
which
was
the
five-man
board
on
the
county
legislature
who
were
also
supervisors
in
their
own
towns.
the
purpose
of
the
plan
as
i
see
it
was
to
maintain
their
individual
parochial
interests
within
the
county
legislature.
they
wanted
to
retain
some
kind
of
town
control
for
their
own
political
means
whatever
they
were.
as
it
turns
out,
the
supervisor
in
one
of
the
towns,
ramapo
for
example,
does
not
even
seat
on
the
county
legislature.
he
never
ran
for
the
county
legislature.
so
if
we’re
going
to
accept
the
county’s
arguments
in
favor
of
town
representation,
ramapo
the
most
populous
town
has
no
representation
on
the
county
level.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
you
have
six
representatives
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes,
from
ramapo
representing
the
people
within
the
district
of
ramapo.
there
is
no
liaison
between
the
town
government
however
and
the
county
government.
in
other
words,
no
one
on
the
town
level
knows
what’s
going
on
in
the
county
and
no
one
in
the
county
will
carry
forward
any
basic
plans
that
have
been
proposed
by
the
town
government.
this
is
what
i
mean
by
no
representation
of
the
town
itself.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
right.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
in
the
present
system,
i
really
could
not
say.
i
have
no
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no.
we
rely
on
good-faith
effort.
we
don’t
believe
that
the
arithmetic
is
as
important
as
the
effort
that
has
not
been
made
by
the
county
to
maintain
equal
representation.
as
i
say,
i
am
not
concern
that
last
year,
it
was
11.9%.
this
year,
i
believe
its
8%.
i’m
more
concerned
that
the
effort
of
the
county
to
achieve
equal
representation
was
not
made.
and
i
believe
that
this
was
mandated
in
kirkpatrick.
it
follows
the
“as
nearly
as
is
practicable”
rule
of
wesberry
which
was
cited
by
reynolds
in
extending
the
wesberry
rule
to
state
government.
it
was
again
cited
in
avery
relating
to
county
government
and
the
whole
projection
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
set
fort
in
the
recent
hadley
case
where
wesberry,
reynolds,
and
avery
were
cited.
we
believe
kirkpatrick
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes,
if
i
may
just
finish
this.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
believe
that
the
kirkpatrick
reasoning
of
good-faith
effort
has
to
apply
to
all
these
cases
because
if
it
elucidates
wesberry
it
must
follow
through
into
the
cases
the
followed
it.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we
feel
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
if
i
may
so.
the
math
that
we
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
presented
a
single-member
district
matter
where
we
make
--
we
try
to
make
a
good-faith
effort
at
position
at
the
same
time
retaining
the
cohesiveness
of
villages
and
town
lines
wherever
possible.
we
believe
the
interests
of
a
village
for
example
are
much
more
cohesive
than
the
interests
of
a
town
which
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
most
of
the
logic
towns
have
such
varying
interests.
and
we
feel
that
the
effort
can
be
made
to
retain
certain
boundaries
while
at
the
same
making
the
effort
for
equal
representation.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
clarify
a
few
points
that
were
just
--
that
have
just
been
made.
in

to

for
two
reasons.
number
one,
the
static
boundaries.
number
two,
we
do
not
believe
the
good-faith
effort
has
been
made.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
we
do
not.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
we
do
not.
we
only
object
to
it
as
it
applies
to
rockland
county.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
i
do
not.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
i
do
not.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
it
was
made
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
not
made
here,
right.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
county
of
rockland
has
made
a
good
faith-effort
to
achieve
the
precise
mathematical
equality
which
was
required
by
this
court
in
kirkpatrick
against
preisler.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we
argue
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we’re
not
arguing
this
case
on
the
basis
of
numbers.
we’re
arguing
it
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
that’s
correct.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
for
the
fact
that
reynolds
said
that
population
should
be
the
controlling
factor
in
deciding
a
reapportionment
plan.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
well,
basic
--
right,
for
this
year
it
would
be
an
equal
plan.
next
year,
it
might
not
which
is
the
--
this
is
the
basis
of
our
argument
that
whereas
today,
we
may
have
a
0.5%
deviation
and
it
might
pass
master
under
the
plan,
under
the
cases.
however,
by
the
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
that’s
correct.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
as
i
know
it
has
--
we’ve
had
weighted
voting
which
was
rejected
by
the
lower
court
as
it
applies
to
rockland.
we
have
never
had
any
other
plan.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
i
do
not.
i
reject
it.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
believe
that
for
rockland,
because
of
its
size,
because
of
its
growth,
a
single-member
plan
is
the
only
plan
that
can
be
valid
representative
and
practical.
i
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
well,
they
have
had
a
man
there.
right.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
would
have
a
vote.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes.
and
actually
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we
do
not
feel
that
rockland
is
capable
of
having
equal
representation
without
single-member
districts.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
it
is
permanent
subject
to
changes
of
district
lines
as
population
changes.
even
a
single-member
district
plan
will
not
--
you
won’t
have
the
same
districts
year
after
year.
however,
because
they
are
not
static
lines,
you
can
shift
your
lines
so
as
to
take
care
of
the
population
increases
or
shifts
or
whatever
they
may
be.
another
advantage
of
single-member
districts
of
course
is
that
the
legislature
would
not
become
unwieldy
as
it
can
under
this
multi-member
plan.
assuming
that
the
population
of
stony
point
for
example
were
to
remain
fairly
static,
and
the
population
of
ramapo
which
is
our
largest
town
continues
to
increase.
we
can
have
as
many
as
20-25
even
more
legislators
in
a
county,
the
size
of
rockland
and
we
don’t
think
that
would
make
a
very
workable
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
practical
matter,
many
people
feel
that
the
present
18
that
we
have
is
not
very
workable,
too
large.
basically,
we
don’t
think
that
the
county
made
good-faith
effort
because
they
accepted
as
their
basic
premise
the
fact
that
they
should
be
town
representation
on
the
county
level.
because
of
that,
we
have
the
town
boundary
lines.
the
towns
and
the
county
of
course
do
have
interrelated
functions.
however,
the
plan
itself
does
not
provide
for
town
representation
on
the
county
level.
people
who
are
elected
within
the
towns
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
town
government.
they
are
in
effect
representing
the
people
within
their
district
as
a
single-member
district
legislator
would.
the
only
one
who
would
have
liaison
of
course
is
the
town
supervisor
who
may
be
elected
to
the
county
legislature.
but
it’s
only
one
vote
out
of
18
and
he
really
does
not
have
the
ability
to
influence
legislation
without
one
vote
with
regard
to
his
town.
furthermore,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
need
for
town
representation
on
the
county
level.
rockland
is
no
longer
a
small
rural
community.
it
has
grown
from
a
137,000
in
1960
to,
i
believe
228,000
in
1970.
it
has
--
it
offers
services
in
the
area
of
air
and
water
pollution
now,
mental
health
welfare
help,
and
so
on.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
originally,
when
this
plan
was
put
forth
it
was
created
by
the
board
of
supervisors
which
was
the
five-man
board
on
the
county
legislature
who
were
also
supervisors
in
their
own
towns.
the
purpose
of
the
plan
as
i
see
it
was
to
maintain
their
individual
parochial
interests
within
the
county
legislature.
they
wanted
to
retain
some
kind
of
town
control
for
their
own
political
means
whatever
they
were.
as
it
turns
out,
the
supervisor
in
one
of
the
towns,
ramapo
for
example,
does
not
even
seat
on
the
county
legislature.
he
never
ran
for
the
county
legislature.
so
if
we’re
going
to
accept
the
county’s
arguments
in
favor
of
town
representation,
ramapo
the
most
populous
town
has
no
representation
on
the
county
level.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
you
have
six
representatives
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes,
from
ramapo
representing
the
people
within
the
district
of
ramapo.
there
is
no
liaison
between
the
town
government
however
and
the
county
government.
in
other
words,
no
one
on
the
town
level
knows
what’s
going
on
in
the
county
and
no
one
in
the
county
will
carry
forward
any
basic
plans
that
have
been
proposed
by
the
town
government.
this
is
what
i
mean
by
no
representation
of
the
town
itself.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
right.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
in
the
present
system,
i
really
could
not
say.
i
have
no
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no.
we
rely
on
good-faith
effort.
we
don’t
believe
that
the
arithmetic
is
as
important
as
the
effort
that
has
not
been
made
by
the
county
to
maintain
equal
representation.
as
i
say,
i
am
not
concern
that
last
year,
it
was
11.9%.
this
year,
i
believe
its
8%.
i’m
more
concerned
that
the
effort
of
the
county
to
achieve
equal
representation
was
not
made.
and
i
believe
that
this
was
mandated
in
kirkpatrick.
it
follows
the
“as
nearly
as
is
practicable”
rule
of
wesberry
which
was
cited
by
reynolds
in
extending
the
wesberry
rule
to
state
government.
it
was
again
cited
in
avery
relating
to
county
government
and
the
whole
projection
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
set
fort
in
the
recent
hadley
case
where
wesberry,
reynolds,
and
avery
were
cited.
we
believe
kirkpatrick
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
yes,
if
i
may
just
finish
this.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
i
believe
that
the
kirkpatrick
reasoning
of
good-faith
effort
has
to
apply
to
all
these
cases
because
if
it
elucidates
wesberry
it
must
follow
through
into
the
cases
the
followed
it.
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
we
feel
--
ms.
doris
friedman
ulman
no,
if
i
may
so.
the
math
that
we
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
presented
a
single-member
district
matter
where
we
make
--
we
try
to
make
a
good-faith
effort
at
position
at
the
same
time
retaining
the
cohesiveness
of
villages
and
town
lines
wherever
possible.
we
believe
the
interests
of
a
village
for
example
are
much
more
cohesive
than
the
interests
of
a
town
which
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
most
of
the
logic
towns
have
such
varying
interests.
and
we
feel
that
the
effort
can
be
made
to
retain
certain
boundaries
while
at
the
same
making
the
effort
for
equal
representation.
thank
you
very
much.
