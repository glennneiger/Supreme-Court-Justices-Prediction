it’s
absolutely
impossible

in

of
the

i
understand
it
sets
out
the

indicates
the
population
of
each
one
of
the
district.
and
in
so
far,
that
must
you
begin
cutting
representative
in
half
or
something,
that’s
the
best
that
can
be
done
with
the
multi-member
plan,
isn’t
it?
justice

you

that’s
insufficient?
