unknown
speaker
you’re
not
taking
one
of
the
member
district
judge
such
that?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
the
attitude
of,
mr.
barone
of
your
clients
to
the
molof
plan?
unknown
speaker
to
the
--
is
it
molof?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn’t
precisely
my
question.
my
question
is,
would
your
clients
in
the
posture
of
the
case
today
support
the
molof
plan?
unknown
speaker
alright.
even
though
it
has
a
variation
of
3.5%?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
really
mean
that?
if
it
were
7.6,
would
you
be
supporting
it?
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
ulman
--
unknown
speaker
--
aren’t
you,
i
take
it
one
of
your
points
is
that
in
drawing
in
a
multi-member
district,
the
number
of
representatives
that
that
multi-member
district
is
entitled
to
is
not
just
a
multiple
of
the
base
population
figure?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
one
of
your
points
was
that,
in
this
case,
that
a
multi-member
district
is
really
overrepresented
is
a
sign
that
representatives
--
the
number
of
representatives
which
is
just
a
pure
share
of
multiple
of
the
base
population
figure?
unknown
speaker
let’s
just
--
let’s
assume
the
multi-member
district
here,
the
system
came
out
with
a
1%
deviation
or
half
of
1%
deviation
and
was
as
close
to
equalities
you
could
possibly
get.
you
would
accept
it?
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
attack
the
idea
of
assigning
to
a
multi-member
district?
that
number
of
representative
which
is
just
a
multiple
of
the
base
--
unknown
speaker
--
as
a
present
figure.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
buy
the
notion
then
that
a
multi-member
district
is
overrepresented?
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
the
defense
here?
unknown
speaker
however,
that
claim
was
made
in
new
york
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mrs.
ulman.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
even
if
you
had
virtually
precise
mathematical
equality
using
town
lines
--
unknown
speaker
--
even
if
that
were
achieved,
would
you
still
argue
that
this
would
not
satisfy
--
unknown
speaker
--
constitutional
terms?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
then
if
you’re
not
that
in
fact
you
are
essentially
attacking
the
legitimacy
of
any
reapportionment
plan
that
uses
fixed
town
lines
as
a
basis
for
opposing
representation.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
do
that
consistently
where
the
suggestion
in
reynolds
and
sims
that
it
is
appropriate
to
use
town
and
county
wise?
unknown
speaker
my
point,
my
hypothetical
was
that
you
would
come
out
with
the
basic
quality
that
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
you’re
saying
that
that
would
be
impossible
to
maintain
equality
of
certain
things
happen
by
just
designing
different
members
of
representatives
--
unknown
speaker
--
by
the
district,
unless,
you
went
to
fractional
voting?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
fractional
voting
then
rejected
in
the
new
york
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
the
weighted
voting
or
fractional
voting
or
do
you
reject
it?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
every
district
should
have
at
least
one
vote
not
a
half
vote.
unknown
speaker
although
they
would
have
a
man
there
--
they
would
have
a
man
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
a
man
there
with
a
--
unknown
speaker
whatever
24.50
can
have
plus
his
half
vote.
unknown
speaker
in
the
district
we’re
getting
some
that
don’t
have
any
vote.
unknown
speaker
we’re
getting
someone
in
the
congress
who
don’t
have
any
vote.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
ulman,
you
made
mention
a
minute
ago
about
a
permanent
plan.
is
any
reapportionment
plan
permanent?
unknown
speaker
this
isn’t
anything
like
an
effort
of
some
reform
group
or
movement
to
try
to
get
rid
of
the
professional
politicians
or
anything
like
that.
unknown
speaker
just
a
matter
of
the
simple
mathematics?
unknown
speaker
philosophically.
unknown
speaker
as
of
1969
but
not
true
as
of
1970,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
there
--
do
i
understand
there’s
a
census
or
at
least
a
count
of
the
population
of
rockland
county
every
year?
unknown
speaker
every
three
years.
the
county
itself
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
bureau
of
census?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
three
years
from
now,
that
census
showed
a
great
dislocation.
there
could,
any
plaintiff
could
come
in
and
say
it’s
a
constitutional
required
you’re
not
reapportioned.
unknown
speaker
that’s
true
with
any
plan.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
whole
process
of
--
i
recommend
to
stop
and
get
away
from.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
basis
for
--
was
it
a
judicial
rejection
of
weighted
or
fractional
voting
in
this
case
or
was
it
by
the
commissioner
or
by
the
people
or
both?
unknown
speaker
not
feasible,
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
so
onto
this
plan,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
have
other
districts
are
all
in
town.
unknown
speaker
i’ll
put
it
this
way.
assume
the
population
changes
so
that
in
order
to
have
each
town
represented,
you
must
have
less
than
one
vote
assigned
to
some
town.
that
wouldn’t
raise
the
problem
here
talking
about
then
you’d
still
have
it,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
just
with
the
half
of
(inaudible)
or
something?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
i
gather
the
argument
on
the
other
side
was
that
technique
theoretically
could
result
in
very
wide
--
much
wider
variation
and
population
change
is
great.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
--
have
sort
of
started
with
the
one
full
vote,
you
just
start
with
the
half
vote.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cornell
may
i
ask,
basically
is
your
proposition
that
proactive
tests
applies
throughout
the
--
a
little
more
play
in
the
joints
when
you’re
dealing
with
local
and
county
government
or
is
your
proposition
that
where
you’re
dealing
with
rockland
county
draw
to
be
a
different
test
from
that
which
apply
to
what
you
are
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
the
same
test
but
with
a
little
more
latitude?
unknown
speaker
in
dealing
with
the
local
county.
unknown
speaker
are
you
--
you
would
say
then
that
when
you’re
dealing
with
local
government,
the
desire
to
organize
on
a
town
shift
line
basis
or
town
line
basis
especially
where
they
have
real
functions
as
in
this
case
is
a
rational
justification
of
excuse
for
some
population
variation?
unknown
speaker
whereas,
but
that
it
might
not
be
enough
of
an
excuse
if
the
variation
were
50%
or
some
higher
figure?
unknown
speaker
but
--
and
also,
it
might
not
be
a
justification
that
the
town
lines
were
really
functionally
irrelevant
to
a
local
government.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
this
is
base
not
on
the
1970
but
on
the
figures
that
were
actually
used?
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
smallest
of
the
numbers.
unknown
speaker
the
town
lines
might
be,
i
take
it
that
your
position
must
be
the
town
lines
have
some
real
substance
in
them
for
purpose
of
local
government
at
the
same
variations
might
not
be
satisfactorily
justified
but
on
the
town
line
basis,
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
congressional
district.
unknown
speaker
but
also
the
town
line
--
the
basis
of
the
town
lines
perhaps
have
less
significance
with
respect
to
a
representative
or
congressman?
unknown
speaker
was
it
any
testimony
taken
into
connection
with
this
plan
in
the
lower
courts?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
--
one
of
the
attacks
on
the
multi-member
plan
in
the
lower
courts
was
that
they
expect
the
side
of
multi-member
district
shouldn’t
be
just
a
mere
multiple
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
was
there
--
weren’t
any
experts
or
anything
called
in
the
connection
with
this?
unknown
speaker
but
then
there
were
no
counter-mathematics
presented?
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
any
other
court
cases
that
involved
the
same
claim?
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
any
others?
unknown
speaker
based
on
the
banzhaf?
unknown
speaker
any
others
where
this
have
been
litigated?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
know
any
instances
where
those
people
who
are
drafting
apportionment
plans
either
judges
or
commissions
or
lawyers
or
legislators
have
run
on
the
assumption
that
multi-member
districts
should
be
assigned
strength
on
some
basis
other
than
the
multiple
of
the
base
figure?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn’t
suggest
how
much
discounts
he
make,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
he
just
has
too
much
punch
in
the
single
district
having
several,
several
representatives
as
against
some
other
districts
having
a
fewer
number
or
any
one.
unknown
speaker
and
somehow,
you’re
supposed
to
discount
it.
how
much?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that’s
just
something
it
goes
out
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
justification?
unknown
speaker
he
really
thinks
that
it’s
so
(inaudible)
that
you
ought
to
be
to
a
single-member
district.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
his
basic
premise
is
right
maybe
there’s
some
logic
to
that.
unknown
speaker
i
said
if
his
basic
essence.
unknown
speaker
if
you
make
that
assumption,
do
you
think
reynolds
against
sims
would
have
come
out
differently?
unknown
speaker
that’s
interesting.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cornell,
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
in
your
state
of
new
york
involving
one
of
the
agencies
of
the
municipal
government
of
the
city
of
new
york
involving
barrel
representation
in
the
city?
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
had
the
citation
of
that?
i
think
this
court
denied
certiorari
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
unknown
speaker
in
the
case
i’m
think
of.
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
in
addition
to
its
apportionment
representation,
each
of
the
barrels
be
it
rich
man
or
queens
or
manhattans
or
kings,
each
had
two
representations.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
three-judge
court
case?
unknown
speaker
and
did
it
come
here?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
action
used.
unknown
speaker
in
case
i’m
thinking
if
it
is
[voice
overlap]
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
blaikie
case?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
taking
one
of
the
member
district
judge
such
that?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
the
attitude
of,
mr.
barone
of
your
clients
to
the
molof
plan?
unknown
speaker
to
the
--
is
it
molof?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn’t
precisely
my
question.
my
question
is,
would
your
clients
in
the
posture
of
the
case
today
support
the
molof
plan?
unknown
speaker
alright.
even
though
it
has
a
variation
of
3.5%?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
really
mean
that?
if
it
were
7.6,
would
you
be
supporting
it?
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
ulman
--
unknown
speaker
--
aren’t
you,
i
take
it
one
of
your
points
is
that
in
drawing
in
a
multi-member
district,
the
number
of
representatives
that
that
multi-member
district
is
entitled
to
is
not
just
a
multiple
of
the
base
population
figure?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
one
of
your
points
was
that,
in
this
case,
that
a
multi-member
district
is
really
overrepresented
is
a
sign
that
representatives
--
the
number
of
representatives
which
is
just
a
pure
share
of
multiple
of
the
base
population
figure?
unknown
speaker
let’s
just
--
let’s
assume
the
multi-member
district
here,
the
system
came
out
with
a
1%
deviation
or
half
of
1%
deviation
and
was
as
close
to
equalities
you
could
possibly
get.
you
would
accept
it?
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
attack
the
idea
of
assigning
to
a
multi-member
district?
that
number
of
representative
which
is
just
a
multiple
of
the
base
--
unknown
speaker
--
as
a
present
figure.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
buy
the
notion
then
that
a
multi-member
district
is
overrepresented?
unknown
speaker
if
that
was
the
defense
here?
unknown
speaker
however,
that
claim
was
made
in
new
york
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mrs.
ulman.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
even
if
you
had
virtually
precise
mathematical
equality
using
town
lines
--
unknown
speaker
--
even
if
that
were
achieved,
would
you
still
argue
that
this
would
not
satisfy
--
unknown
speaker
--
constitutional
terms?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
then
if
you’re
not
that
in
fact
you
are
essentially
attacking
the
legitimacy
of
any
reapportionment
plan
that
uses
fixed
town
lines
as
a
basis
for
opposing
representation.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
do
that
consistently
where
the
suggestion
in
reynolds
and
sims
that
it
is
appropriate
to
use
town
and
county
wise?
unknown
speaker
my
point,
my
hypothetical
was
that
you
would
come
out
with
the
basic
quality
that
(voice

unknown
speaker
you’re
saying
that
that
would
be
impossible
to
maintain
equality
of
certain
things
happen
by
just
designing
different
members
of
representatives
--
unknown
speaker
--
by
the
district,
unless,
you
went
to
fractional
voting?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
fractional
voting
then
rejected
in
the
new
york
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
the
weighted
voting
or
fractional
voting
or
do
you
reject
it?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
every
district
should
have
at
least
one
vote
not
a
half
vote.
unknown
speaker
although
they
would
have
a
man
there
--
they
would
have
a
man
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
a
man
there
with
a
--
unknown
speaker
whatever
24.50
can
have
plus
his
half
vote.
unknown
speaker
in
the
district
we’re
getting
some
that
don’t
have
any
vote.
unknown
speaker
we’re
getting
someone
in
the
congress
who
don’t
have
any
vote.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
ulman,
you
made
mention
a
minute
ago
about
a
permanent
plan.
is
any
reapportionment
plan
permanent?
unknown
speaker
this
isn’t
anything
like
an

of
some

or

to

do
i
understand
there’s
a

at

a
count
of
the
population
of
rockland
county
every

unknown
speaker
every
three
years.
the
county
itself
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
bureau
of
census?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
three
years
from
now,
that
census
showed
a
great
dislocation.
there
could,
any
plaintiff
could
come
in
and
say
it’s
a
constitutional
required
you’re
not
reapportioned.
unknown
speaker
that’s
true
with
any
plan.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
whole
process
of
--
i
recommend
to
stop
and
get
away
from.
unknown

what
was
the
basis
for

was

a
judicial
rejection

in

or
was
it
by
the

or
by
the
people
or

unknown

not
feasible,
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
so
onto
this
plan,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
have
other
districts
are
all
in
town.
unknown
speaker
i’ll
put
it
this
way.
assume
the
population
changes
so
that
in
order
to
have
each
town
represented,
you
must
have
less
than
one
vote
assigned
to
some
town.
that
wouldn’t
raise
the
problem
here
talking
about
then
you’d
still
have
it,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
just
with
the
half
of
(inaudible)
or
something?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
i
gather
the
argument
on
the
other
side
was
that
technique
theoretically
could
result
in
very

much

is

your
proposition
that
where
you’re
dealing
with
rockland
county
draw
to
be
a
different
test
from
that
which
apply
to
what
you
are
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
the
same
test
but
with
a
little
more
latitude?
unknown
speaker
in
dealing
with
the
local
county.
unknown
speaker
are
you
--
you
would
say
then
that
when
you’re
dealing
with
local
government,
the
desire
to
organize
on
a
town
shift
line
basis
or
town
line
basis
especially
where
they
have
real
functions
as
in
this
case
is
a
rational
justification
of
excuse
for
some
population
variation?
unknown
speaker
whereas,
but
that
it
might
not
be
enough
of
an
excuse
if
the
variation
were
50%
or
some
higher
figure?
unknown
speaker
but
--
and
also,
it
might
not
be
a
justification
that
the
town
lines
were
really
functionally
irrelevant
to
a
local
government.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
this
is
base
not
on
the
1970
but
on
the
figures
that
were
actually
used?
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
smallest
of
the
numbers.
unknown
speaker
the
town
lines
might
be,
i
take
it
that
your
position
must
be
the
town
lines
have
some
real
substance
in
them
for
purpose
of
local
government
at
the
same
variations
might
not
be
satisfactorily
justified
but
on
the
town
line
basis,
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
congressional
district.
unknown
speaker
but
also
the
town
line
--
the
basis
of
the
town
lines
perhaps
have
less
significance
with
respect
to
a
representative
or
congressman?
unknown
speaker
was
it
any
testimony
taken
into
connection
with
this
plan
in
the
lower
courts?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
the
--
one
of
the
attacks
on
the
multi-member
plan
in
the
lower
courts
was
that
they
expect
the
side
of
multi-member
district
shouldn’t
be
just
a
mere
multiple
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
was
there
--
weren’t
any
experts
or
anything
called
in
the
connection
with
this?
unknown
speaker
but
then
there
were
no
counter-mathematics
presented?
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
any
other
court
cases
that
involved
the
same
claim?
unknown
speaker
have
there
been
any
others?
unknown
speaker
based
on
the
banzhaf?
unknown
speaker
any
others
where
this
have
been
litigated?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
know
any
instances
where
those
people
who
are
drafting
apportionment
plans
either
judges
or
commissions
or
lawyers
or
legislators
have
run
on
the
assumption
that
multi-member
districts
should
be
assigned
strength
on
some
basis
other
than
the
multiple
of
the
base
figure?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn’t
suggest
how
much
discounts
he
make,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
he
just
has
too
much
punch
in
the
single
district
having
several,
several
representatives
as
against
some
other
districts
having
a
fewer
number
or
any
one.
unknown
speaker
and
somehow,
you’re
supposed
to
discount
it.
how
much?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that’s
just
something
it
goes
out
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
justification?
unknown
speaker
he
really
thinks
that
it’s
so
(inaudible)
that
you
ought
to
be
to
a
single-member
district.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
his
basic
premise
is
right
maybe
there’s
some
logic
to
that.
unknown
speaker
i
said
if
his
basic
essence.
unknown
speaker
if
you
make
that
assumption,
do
you
think
reynolds
against
sims
would
have
come
out
differently?
unknown
speaker
that’s
interesting.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cornell,
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
in
your
state
of
new
york
involving
one
of
the
agencies
of
the
municipal
government
of
the
city
of
new
york
involving
barrel
representation
in
the
city?
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
had
the
citation
of
that?
i
think
this
court
denied
certiorari
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
unknown
speaker
in
the
case
i’m
think
of.
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
in
addition
to
its
apportionment
representation,
each
of
the
barrels
be
it
rich
man
or
queens
or
manhattans
or
kings,
each
had
two
representations.
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
three-judge
court
case?
unknown
speaker
and
did
it
come
here?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
action
used.
unknown
speaker
in
case
i’m
thinking
if
it
is
[voice

unknown
speaker
is
that
the
blaikie
case?
