that

well,
how

the

chief

eighty
some

chief

well,
then
a

mrs.

chief

can
you
define

what
you

mean
by

static
for
how
long?
chief

warren
e.

if
a

reflects
representation,
it
is
substantially
representative

equal
here
a
variation
of

modest
amount
is
it

to

chief

e.

why

chief

warren
e.

i
wonder
if
your

your

takes
into

the

in
the

of

as

with

mr.

chief

e.

if
you
follow
the
professor
places
towards
logical
conclusion
there’s
something
inherently
unfair
at

whatever
number
or
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
alaska
has
only
one.
chief

e.

i
think
there’s
a
geometric
progression
in
the
force
and
influence
which
new

congress
can
exercise
as
compared
to
the
last
case.
i
suppose,
inherent
to
is,
that
because
new

is
closer
to
washington
than
alaska.
there
is
some
kind
of
a
mathematical
factor
that
gives

good
deal

more
