rockland
county
is
located
in
the
new
york
city
metropolitan
area
approximately
30
miles
from
new
york
city.
until
a
decade
ago,
it
was
a
very
small
suburban
community
that
is
until
the
development
of
the
new
york
state
through
it
where
upon
it
experienced
rapid
if
not
phenomenal
growth.
it
consists
of
five
towns
and
has
been
traditionally
governed
by
five
men
board
of
supervisors,
each
supervisor
being
elected
by
one
of
the
towns
comprising
the
copy
without
regard
to
population.
in
1964,
this
court
rendered
a
historic
decision
in
the
case
of
reynolds
against
sims.
and
in
1965,
a
resident
of
rockland
county
commenced
an
action
in
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
to
compel
the
rockland
county
board
of
supervisors
to
reapportion
themselves
in
a
manner
more
consistent
with
that
decision.
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
referred
that
matter
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
as
a
result,
in
1966,
the
board
of
supervisors
of
the
county
of
rockland
were
directed
to
reapportion
the
county
of
rockland
in
accordance
with
the
mandates
of
this
court
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
district
court
further
directed
that
a
plan
of
reapportionment
be
placed
upon
the
ballot
for
the
general
election
of
november
1966
for
referendum.
this
plan
was
rejected
as
were
two
subsequent
plans.
in
1968,
a
taxpayer’s
action
was
commenced
by
samuel
j.
abate,
one
of
the
petitioners
herein,
to
have
the
county
of
rockland
reapportion
itself
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
mandates
of
this
honorable
court.
after
several
motions
and
hearings,
the
respondents
herein
were
directed
to
serve
an

the
respondent
simultaneously
moved
in
the
new

state
supreme
court
for
summary

requesting
that
the
court
direct
implementation
of
a
local
law
providing
for
weighted
voting
without
referendum.
the
plan
for
weighted
voting
was
rejected
by
the
court
and
the
respondents
herein
were
directed
to
present
to
the
court
a
proposed
plan
of
reapportionment
with
all
deliberate
speed.
the
board
of
supervisors
had
previous
this
point
appointed
a
sub-committee
of
the
charter
commission
and
the
charter
commission
--
the
sub-committee
of
the
charter
commission
recommended
to
the
board
a
single-member
district
plan
which
was
rejected
by
the
board.
the
board
subsequently
had
recommended
to
it
a
multi-member
district
plan
by
the
sub-committee
of
the
charter
commission
and
that
multi-member
district
plan
was
presented
to
the
court.
the
petitioners
herein
objected
to
the
proposed
multi-member
district
on
several
grounds
and
further
sought
to
submit
for
the
court’s
approval.
a
single-member
district
plan
which
was
considered
to
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
decisions
of
this
honorable
court,
such
presentation
was
not
committed
by
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
and
the
court
approved
the
multi-member
district
plan
submitted
by
the
board
of
supervisors
to
respondents
herein.
appeals
were
taken
to
the
appellate
division
in
the
second
department
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
affirmed
with
the
dissent
by
the
late
justice
beldock.
a
subsequent
appeal
was
taken
to
the
new
york
states
court
of
appeals
where
again
the
lower
courts
decision
was
affirmed
with
the
dissent
by
chief
judge
fuld.
subsequently,
permission
for
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
honorable
court.
there
are
there
petitioners
in
this
proceeding
and
by
special
permission
of
this
court,
all
three
have
been
granted
permission
to
appear
today
and
orally
argue
this
course.
i
should
like
to
tell
the
court
that
there
will
be
no
repetition
of
argument
by
counsel
in
order
to
save
the
time
of
this
court.
we
sincerely
believe
that
this
is
the
only
fashion
in
which
this
matter
could
be
properly
laid
before
this
court.
i
have
been
chosen
to
make
the
opening
statement
and
so
i
give
you
some
of
the
history
of
this
matter
and
will
also
outline
for
you
some
of
the
arguments
that
counsel
will
make.
counsel
will
argue
that
the
multi-member
district
plan
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
equal
representation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states
as
such
requirements
have
been
mandated
by
this
court.
counsel
will
show
that
the
respondents
have
failed
to
make
the
good-faith
effort
which
is
required
that
a
multi-member
district
plan
is
unconstitutional
if
its
district
lines
are
static
but
its
population
is
subject
to
change.
that
a
single-member
district
plan
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
doctrine.
and
that
the
standards
of
equal
representation
as
mandated
by
this
court
apply
equally
to
all
levels
of
government,
and
that
multi-member
districts
in
the
county
of
rockland
cannot
possibly
meet
the
standards.
according
to
--
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes,
mr.
justice.
our
opposition
is
that
every
decision
of
this
court
has
been
consistent.
every
decision
of
this
court
in
spite
of
the
reynolds
decision
which
indicated
that
certain
de
minimis
situations
were
unavoidable
on
certain
situations
that
regardless
of
that,
the
requirement
is
that
there
must
be
an
absolute
de
minimis
and
if
one
plan
can
achieve,
if
you
will,
a
more
minimal
population
variation,
that
is
the
plan
which
must
be
accepted.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
we
say
that
a
more
minimal
population
variance
or
disparity
can
be
achieved
by
use
of
the
single-member
district
plan.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
no,
sir.
multi-member
districts,
floterial
districts,
single-member
districts
have
all
been
approved
as
being
constitutionally
proper.
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
de
minimis
rule
set
forth
in
reynolds
which
must
be
adhered
to
and
the
plan
which
bested
here
is
to
that
must
be
the
plan
that
is
adopted
in
order
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
doctrine.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
no,
the
highest
--
mr.
frank
p.
barone
no,
the
highest
would
be
13,000
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
p.
barone
--
in
orangetown.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
sir,
the
1969
census
--
special
census
figures
which
were
used
for
this
calculation
had
since
been
superseded
by
the
1970
census
figures
which
i
do
not
have.
i
believe
that
counsel
for
respondents
has
these
figures
and
will
undoubtedly
bring
them
before
the
court.
however,
the
population
variance,
the
change
in
population,
i
respectfully
submit
will
in
fact
not
make
any
difference
in
the
argument
that
petitioners
make
since
the
population
variance
can
bring
the
difference
to
a
point
higher
or
lower
as
the
population
increases.
so
that
we
must
deal
i
believe
in
this
matter
and
counsel
will
point
this
out.
we
must
deal
with
the
two
basic
requirements
that
i
believe
this
court
has
mandated
in
the
choosing
of
a
reapportionment
plan
and
that
is,
that
the
plan
was
determined
after
good-faith
effort
and
secondly,
that
it
achieves
the
minimal
population
disparity
possible.
and
if
your
honor
please,
with
the
13,000
down
to
the
11,000
creating
an
under
representation
in
orangetown
of
7.1%
and
an
over
representation
in
clarkstown
of
4.8%,
the
entitled
disparity
would
be
11.9%
which
i
believe
--
which
we
believe
to
be
a
population
variance
not
in
keeping
with
requirements
of
this
court
and
its
decision.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes,
it’s
even
increasing
at
a
more
phenomenal
rate
than
that
your
honor
and
i
don’t
have
the
exact
figures
but
i’m
sure
that
counsel
will
indicate
that
the
growth
is
not
only
phenomenal
but
yearly
increase
--
the
rate
increases
yearly.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes,
it
certainly
might
not
be
acceptable
at
the
end
of
that
calendar
year.
that
is
essentially
the
reason
we
are
here
because
we
believe
that
a
single-member
district
which
does
not
have
static
lines
as
our
multi-member
district
does
can
best
be
moved
or
be
flexible
enough
so
that
in
the
determining
representation,
the
ability
to
determine
that
representation
is
inherent
in
the
plan
which
it
is
not
in
the
multi-member
district
plan
which
utilizes
town
lines
as
the
boundary
for
the
district.
as
i
say,
the
disparity
in
the
county
of
rockland
at
the
present
moment
is
11.9.
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
have
clearly
indicated
that
a
good-faith
effort
must
be
made.
secondly,
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
population
variance,
a
disparity,
that
there
must
be
some
articulate
reason
set
forth
to
show
that
the
policy
of
the
state
clearly
indicates
that
such
a
population
variance
will
be
tolerated
by
reason
of
state
policy.
there
has
been
no
state
policy
clearly
enunciated
by
the
state
of
new
york
permitting
such
population
variances.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
decisions
in
this
court
as
i
said
moment
ago
are
absolutely
consistent
and
that
population
variances
will
not
be
tolerated.
whatever
the
plan,
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
a
clear
rational
state
policy
and
further
that
a
good-faith
effort
has
been
made.
the
inescapable
conclusion
must
be
that
whenever
it
is
shown,
that
another
plan
of
reapportionment
can
reduce
the
population
variance
it
must
be
adopted
in
lieu
of
the
existing
plan
no
matter
how
minimal
the
population
deviation
is
under
the
existing
plan.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
the
attitude
to
which
plan?
i’m
sorry
i
didn’t
hear
you.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
the
molof
petitioners,
june
molof,
mindy
baker,
etcetera
entered
this
matter
as
intervenors
in
the
lower
court
and
we
substantially
take
the
same
position
that
the
only
plan
which
is
workable
in
the
county
of
rockland
is
a
single-member
district
plan.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
since
the
molof
plan
as
you
referred
to
it
your
honor
has
a
population
deviation
of
less
than
the
11.9
presently
in
existence.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
i
think
your
honor,
we
must
support
a
plan
which
has
been
made
on
a
good
faith
--
a
good-faith
effort
has
been
made
in
its
implementation,
and
secondly,
that
the
population
variance
must
be
the
minimum
which
can
possibly
be
had
under
the
circumstances.
and
a
multi-member
district
plan
using
town
lines
as
static
boundaries
cannot
possibly
be
flexible
enough
to
move
with
the
phenomenal
growth
which
this
county
expects
and
which
it
has
had.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
county
of
rockland
had
appointed
a
sub-committee
--
had
appointed
a
charter
commission
and
there
was
a
sub-committee
and
that
sub-committee
did
suggest
a
single-member
plan
that
was
rejected
by
the
board
of
supervisors.
the
board
of
supervisors
in
lieu
of
that
implemented
the
second
recommendation
which
is
a
multi-member
district
plan
utilizing
town
lines
as
static
boundaries
thereby
and
the
fact
incidentally
that
the
supervisors
would
automatically
be
members
of
the
county
legislature,
thereby,
perpetuating
themselves.
counsel
for
--
counsel
--
my
red

come
on

other

this

will

this

to
make
the
good-faith
effort
which
is
required
that
a
multi-member
district
plan
is
unconstitutional
if
its
district
lines
are
static
but
its
population
is
subject
to
change.
that
a
single-member
district
plan
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
doctrine.
and
that
the
standards
of
equal
representation
as
mandated
by
this
court
apply
equally
to
all
levels
of
government,
and
that
multi-member
districts
in
the
county
of
rockland
cannot
possibly
meet
the
standards.
according
to
--
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes,
mr.
justice.
our
opposition
is
that
every
decision
of
this
court
has
been
consistent.
every
decision
of
this
court
in
spite
of
the
reynolds
decision
which
indicated
that
certain
de
minimis
situations
were
unavoidable
on
certain
situations
that
regardless
of
that,
the
requirement
is
that
there
must
be
an
absolute
de
minimis
and
if
one
plan
can
achieve,
if
you
will,
a
more
minimal
population
variation,
that
is
the
plan
which
must
be
accepted.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
we
say
that
a
more
minimal
population
variance
or
disparity
can
be
achieved
by
use
of
the
single-member
district
plan.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
no,
sir.
multi-member
districts,
floterial
districts,
single-member
districts
have
all
been
approved
as
being
constitutionally
proper.
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
de
minimis
rule
set
forth
in
reynolds
which
must
be
adhered
to
and
the
plan
which
bested
here
is
to
that
must
be
the
plan
that
is
adopted
in
order
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
doctrine.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
no,
the
highest
--
mr.
frank
p.
barone
no,
the
highest
would
be
13,000
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
p.
barone
--
in
orangetown.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
sir,
the
1969
census
--
special
census
figures
which
were
used
for
this
calculation
had
since
been
superseded
by
the
1970
census
figures
which
i
do
not
have.
i
believe
that
counsel
for
respondents
has
these
figures
and
will
undoubtedly
bring
them
before
the
court.
however,
the
population
variance,
the
change
in
population,
i
respectfully
submit
will
in
fact
not
make
any
difference
in
the
argument
that
petitioners
make
since
the
population
variance
can
bring
the
difference
to
a
point
higher
or
lower
as
the
population
increases.
so
that
we
must
deal
i
believe
in
this
matter
and
counsel
will
point
this
out.
we
must
deal
with
the
two
basic
requirements
that
i
believe
this
court
has
mandated
in
the
choosing
of
a
reapportionment
plan
and
that
is,
that
the
plan
was
determined
after
good-faith
effort
and
secondly,
that
it
achieves
the
minimal
population
disparity
possible.
and
if
your
honor
please,
with
the
13,000
down
to
the
11,000
creating
an
under
representation
in
orangetown
of
7.1%
and
an
over
representation
in
clarkstown
of
4.8%,
the
entitled
disparity
would
be
11.9%
which
i
believe
--
which
we
believe
to
be
a
population
variance
not
in
keeping
with
requirements
of
this
court
and
its
decision.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes,
it’s
even
increasing
at
a
more
phenomenal
rate
than
that
your
honor
and
i
don’t
have
the
exact
figures
but
i’m
sure
that
counsel
will
indicate
that
the
growth
is
not
only
phenomenal
but
yearly
increase
--
the
rate
increases
yearly.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes,
it
certainly
might
not
be
acceptable
at
the
end
of
that
calendar
year.
that
is
essentially
the
reason
we
are
here
because
we
believe
that
a
single-member
district
which
does
not
have
static
lines
as
our
multi-member
district
does
can
best
be
moved
or
be
flexible
enough
so
that
in
the
determining
representation,
the
ability
to
determine
that
representation
is
inherent
in
the
plan
which
it
is
not
in
the
multi-member
district
plan
which
utilizes
town
lines
as
the
boundary
for
the
district.
as
i
say,
the
disparity
in
the
county
of
rockland
at
the
present
moment
is
11.9.
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
have
clearly
indicated
that
a
good-faith
effort
must
be
made.
secondly,
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
population
variance,
a
disparity,
that
there
must
be
some
articulate
reason
set
forth
to
show
that
the
policy
of
the
state
clearly
indicates
that
such
a
population
variance
will
be
tolerated
by
reason
of
state
policy.
there
has
been
no
state
policy
clearly
enunciated
by
the
state
of
new
york
permitting
such
population
variances.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
decisions
in
this
court
as
i
said
moment
ago
are
absolutely
consistent
and
that
population
variances
will
not
be
tolerated.
whatever
the
plan,
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
a
clear
rational
state
policy
and
further
that
a
good-faith
effort
has
been
made.
the
inescapable
conclusion
must
be
that
whenever
it
is
shown,
that
another
plan
of
reapportionment
can
reduce
the
population
variance
it
must
be
adopted
in
lieu
of
the
existing
plan
no
matter
how
minimal
the
population
deviation
is
under
the
existing
plan.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
the
attitude
to
which
plan?
i’m
sorry
i
didn’t
hear
you.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
the
molof
petitioners,
june
molof,
mindy
baker,
etcetera
entered
this
matter
as
intervenors
in
the
lower
court
and
we
substantially
take
the
same
position
that
the
only
plan
which
is
workable
in
the
county
of
rockland
is
a
single-member
district
plan.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
yes.
since
the
molof
plan
as
you
referred
to
it
your
honor
has
a
population
deviation
of
less
than
the
11.9
presently
in
existence.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
i
think
your
honor,
we
must
support
a
plan
which
has
been
made
on
a
good
faith
--
a
good-faith
effort
has
been
made
in
its
implementation,
and
secondly,
that
the
population
variance
must
be
the
minimum
which
can
possibly
be
had
under
the
circumstances.
and
a
multi-member
district
plan
using
town
lines
as
static
boundaries
cannot
possibly
be
flexible
enough
to
move
with
the
phenomenal
growth
which
this
county
expects
and
which
it
has
had.
mr.
frank
p.
barone
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
county
of
rockland
had
appointed
a
sub-committee
--
had
appointed
a
charter
commission
and
there
was
a
sub-committee
and
that
sub-committee
did
suggest
a
single-member
plan
that
was
rejected
by
the
board
of
supervisors.
the
board
of
supervisors
in
lieu
of
that
implemented
the
second
recommendation
which
is
a
multi-member
district
plan
utilizing
town
lines
as
static
boundaries
thereby
and
the
fact
incidentally
that
the
supervisors
would
automatically
be
members
of
the
county
legislature,
thereby,
perpetuating
themselves.
counsel
for
--
counsel
--
my
red
light’s
come
on
and
other
counsel
in
this
matter
for
petitioners
will
carry
this
point
forward.
thank
you
gentlemen.
