mr.
paul
h.
rivet
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
will
simply
comment
very
briefly
on
mr.
cornell’s
very
excellent
presentation
on
the
multi-member
district.
i
do
not
have
basically
disagree
with
him.
i
don’t
think
the
question
here
that
we
have
to
resolve
is
whether
or
not
multi-member
districts
are
constitutional
per
se
at
all
times.
mr.
banzhaf’s
theory
is
fascinating
but
i
don’t
think
it
should
be
or
need
be
in
any
fashion
controlling
or
for
that
matter
was
never
submitted
by
my
clients
and
never
contended
by
my
clients
below
at
any
point.
i
think
that
there
is
something
that
ought
to
be
brought
out
about
the
county
and
town
relationship.
mr.
cornell
has
put
this
in
the
sense
that
we
have
a
--
only
in
arithmetic
question
and
i
think
that
he
is
fundamentally
in
error.
i
think
the
question
we
have
here
is
whether
we’re
going
to
have
a
county
government
that
is
dominated
and
run
and
oriented
to
the
town
government’s
or
whether
we
are
going
to
have
a
county
government
that
is
oriented
and
responsive
to
the
individual
voters
in
rockland
county.
and
that’s
the
question
that
we
must
resolve
not
whether
there
is
to
be
--
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
well,
maybe
if
i
simply
give
you
some
budget
for
use.
you’ll
have
an
idea
of
the
dimensions
that
we’re
talking
about.
the
county
legislator
on
monday
of
this
week
has
before
it
a
proposed
budget
to
the
year
1971
of
$53
million.
the
largest
town
in
rockland
county
for
next
year,
the
town
of
ramapo
has
a
budget
of
less
than
$5
million.
gentlemen,
the
enormity,
the
tremendous
disparity
in
the
sizes
of
these
governments
of
the
nature
of
the
problems
they
deal
with
is
such
that
we
can
no
longer
in
the
interests
of
the
very
thing
that
mr.
cornell
has
said
that
the
interest
of
meeting
the
growing
problems
of
the
20th
century
have
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
we
have
literally
had
that
situation
in
rockland
county
for
many
years.
this
commission
that
counsel
has
so
well
portrayed
as
having
been
appointed
by
the
board
of
supervisors,
yes
a
commission
was
appointed
and
its
numbers
and
its
representatives
were
designated
by
the
supervisors
and
the
proportions
were
in
direct
relationship
to
the
town
per
se
not
the
numbers
of
people
in
the
towns.
so
that
the
town
of
stony
point
with
12,000
people
have
three
votes
on
that
commission
and
the
town
of
ramapo
with
70,000
people
have
three
votes.
what
can
we
expect
from
a
commission
that
does
not
represent
the
actual
population
of
the
communities?
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
stony
point
still
has
12,000
people
in
it
and
ramapo
has
75,000
people.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
stony
point
has
one
representative.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
but
i’m
talking
about
the
good-faith
effort
that
was
allegedly
made
by
the
county
of
rockland
and
the
argument
has
been
made
that
the
good-faith
effort
is
demonstrated
every
amply
by
the
fact
that
we
had
an
impartial
commission
that
was
appointed
to
do
the
job.
well,
they
did
the
job
alright.
they
came
up
with
the
plan
that
were
maintained
the
town
lines
rigidly
without
any
variation.
and
may
i
point
out
that
in
fortson,
you
recognized
the
right
of
multi-member
districts
and
you
recognized
the
right
to
maintain
boundaries
and
very
properly
so.
but
within
that
system,
there
was
the
ability
to
move
county
lines,
not
the
county
lines
themselves
but
the
counties
within
the
structure
to
insure
equality
of
vote
and
that
the
first
premise
and
this
is
the
assumption
that
i’m
standing
hereon
is
that
my
vote
is
the
most
important
thing.
that
after
that
we
look
at
regional
problems,
we
look
at
governmental
problems.
i
cannot
conceive
that
how
our
forth
forbearers
in
establishing
the
constitutional
would
have
conceived
of
anything
less
than
the
most
important
right
being
the
individual’s
vote.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
its
7.9
your
honor
to
be
specific.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
i
think
that
you
would
then
have
met
obviously
the
mathematical
situation.
there’s
no
question
with
that.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
i
think
it
is
the
first
one
to
be
met.
but
i
think
we
not
look
at
what
has
happened
because
if
we
look
at
what
has
happened
then
i
think
we
also
have
the
right
to
do
some
conjecturing.
counsel
has
objected
in
his
brief
to
speculation
as
to
the
future.
except
that
when
the
future
turned
out
okay
because
the
role
of
the
dice
came
out
that
the
population
margin
went
down,
fine,
okay.
but
i
simply
say
that
all
responsible
authorities
and
this
include
by
the
way
federal
agencies
in
evaluating
rockland
county
for
building
projects.
i’m
involved
with
an
application
right
now
and
i
know
that
rockland
county
is
one
of
the
two
counties
in
the
entire
state
of
new
york
where
there
say
you
don’t
have
to
make
20-year
projections
because
nobody
can
make
an
intelligent
20-year
projection
in
rockland
county.
that
are
growth
is
burgeoning
so
greatly
but
your
honor,
there
are
some
realistic
limitations
on
it
in
the
north
end
of
the
county
which
is
the
base
of
this
plan.
stony
point
is
something
in
excess
of
50%
state
rockland.
the
policy
states
them
to
state
park.
its
ability
to
grow
is
very
severely
limited.
but
the
county
is
going
to
continue
to
grow
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
idle
speculation
to
say
that
the
next
time
around
we
will
have
25
or
35
representatives
in
this
system.
and
it
is
very
possible
that
as
part
of
the
result,
we
may
end
up
with
exactly
the
situation
the
chief
judge
fuld
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
namely,
a
90%
or
an
80%
discrimination.
and
i
don’t
anyone
would
argue
that
that
is
a
good
plan
or
a
good
situation
to
have.
and
what
i’m
pleading
for
is
not
that
you
leave
the
door
open
for
people
to
come
back
and
sue
in
the
future.
my
lord!
we
have
enough
litigation
in
the
courts.
let’s
try
to
devise
plans
to
deal
with
reapportionment
and
rules
that
local
government
can
follow
that
will
ensure
that
we
don’t
have
a
constant
quarrel
and
constant
litigation
every
time
there
is
a
change
in
census.
and
i
think
this
plan
has
within
it
the
invidious
invitation
to
continuing
litigation.
and
i
mean
that
not
only
in
rockland
by
i
think
it
will
be
emulated
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
and
throughout
the
country
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
ahs
the
beauty
from
the
standpoint
of
those
who
are
in
local
government
now
and
who
have
dominated
the
structure,
the
desirability
of
maintaining
their
own.
counsel
has
talked
about
the
rational
state
policy
and
the
importance
of
the
town
and
the
town
supervisors.
he
didn’t
mention
the
fact
that
even
the
state
law
did
not
write
into
it
the
automatic
right
of
the
supervisor
to
seat
on
this
body
and
yet
this
county
legislature,
this
county
board
of
supervisors
in
endeavoring
to
preserve
itself,
not
to
secure
equality
of
representation
gentlemen
but
to
preserve
itself,
put
into
its
local
law
and
when
you
look
in
the
appendix
you’ll
see
it,
the
right
to
seat
not
because
they
are
elected
as
a
legislator
but
because
they
are
elected
as
a
supervisor.
well,
this
was
struck
down
even
in
new
york;
the
lower
courts
struck
this
down
right
from
the
beginning.
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
you
must
look
at
it
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
an
effort
was
being
made
here,
not
what
was
corrected
by
the
courts
because
we’re
talking
about
good
faith.
we’re
talking
about
good
faith
and
we’re
talking
about
good
faith
to
a
voter
and
a
citizen.
nobody
is
a
going
to
reduce
my
taxes
by
the
extent
that
my
vote
is
diminished
in
the
county
of
rockland.
and
yet
my
voice
and
my
vote
this
year
was
reduced
12%
or
11.9%.
next
year
8%.
next
year
perhaps
25%.
and
all
that
i
am
saying
is
that
my
vote
should
always
have
the
same
relationship
within
the
ability
of
men
to
achieve
it.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
effort
has
been
made
here
and
it
is
not
a
question
of
multi-member
districts
or
the
(inaudible)
ideas
of
a
professor
who
has
written
a
very
fascinating
article
on
the
square
root
of
something.
i’m
not
a
mathematician.
i’m
a
lawyer
and
i’m
a
voter
and
i’m
interested
in
government.
judge
stewart,
you
asked
the
question
this
morning
at
the
beginning
of
our
argument
relating
to
the
political
structure.
may
i
comment
on
it?
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
the
petitioners
here
represent
the
entire
spectrum
of
the
political
body.
responsible
leaders
of
the
republican
party,
responsible
leaders
in
the
democratic
party,
public
officials,
elected,
one
of
my
clients
is
a
councilman
in
the
town
of
orangetown,
and
the
petitioners
june
molof
and
others
are
essentially
the
league
of
women
voters
of
rockland
county.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
we
are
not
a
group
of
either
do-gooders
or
people
out
to
hone
an
ax.
we
are
all
seeking
an
effort
to
be
able
to
express
ourselves
fairly
with
equality
before
the
body
politic
and
we
have
been
frustrated
in
it.
mr.
justice
marshall
commented
on,
isn’t
it
better
to
have
a
one
to
one
relationship
because
you
know
who
to
look
to
when
you
have
a
problem
and
you
know
who
to
look
to
when
something
is
not
done.
well,
what
is
happening
now
and
we’re
having
a
circus
in
rockland
county
is
that
we
have
four
and
five
men
representing
40-50,000
people.
and
it’s
a
dreadful
situation
nobody
knows
who’s
responsible
for
what.
and
going
a
step
further,
i
realize
that
a
thousand
people
may
sound
like
very
little.
rockland
county,
despite
my
adversaries,
my
good
friend’s
brief
where
he
points
out
that
well,
you
can’t
divide
an
apartment
house.
rockland
county
is
not
a
county
of
apartment
houses.
this
is
a
county
of
residences.
and
when
we
talk
about
a
thousand
people,
we’re
talking
about
250
families,
250
homes.
that
is
a
very
large
development.
and
moving
a
line
involving
a
hundred
homes
is
not
a
difficult
line,
it
maybe
involved
moving
two
or
three
streets.
we’re
not
talking
about
running
a
line
down
the
(inaudible)
of
an
apartment
house.
there
isn’t
an
apartment
house
in
rockland
county
that
has
a
thousand
people
in
it.
i
doubt
if
there’s
one
in
rockland
county
to
have
more
than
250
people
in
it.
the
issue
is
not
arithmetic.
i
cannot
emphasize
that
too
strongly.
obviously,
we
can’t
win
an
argument
on
arithmetic.
i
mean
because
you
can
play
games
with
these
figures
from
now
until
tomorrow
afternoon
at
this
time,
and
we
would
never
come
to
a
conclusion.
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
wants
to
set
a
rule
where
you
say,
well,
you
can’t
have
more
than
1%
or
you
can’t
have
more
than
3%.
you
must
look
at
the
entire
picture.
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
you
recognize
rigid
boundary
lines
and
i
think
i
understand
why.
very
simply,
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
you
have
islands
divided
by
open
ocean,
in
some
cases,
50,
60
miles
apart.
obviously,
you
couldn’t
divide
a
man
of
course
that
greater
distance.
i
see
my
light
is
on
gentlemen.
mr.
paul
h.

justice,

court.

conceive
that
how
our
forth
forbearers
in
establishing
the
constitutional
would
have
conceived
of
anything
less
than
the
most
important
right
being
the
individual’s
vote.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
its
7.9
your
honor
to
be
specific.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
i
think
that
you
would
then
have
met
obviously
the
mathematical
situation.
there’s
no
question
with
that.
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
i
think
it
is
the
first
one
to
be
met.
but
i
think
we
not
look
at
what
has
happened
because
if
we
look
at
what
has
happened
then
i
think
we
also
have
the
right
to
do
some
conjecturing.
counsel
has
objected
in
his
brief
to
speculation
as
to
the
future.
except
that
when
the
future
turned
out
okay
because
the
role
of
the
dice
came
out
that
the
population
margin
went
down,
fine,
okay.
but
i
simply
say
that
all
responsible
authorities
and
this
include
by
the
way
federal
agencies
in
evaluating
rockland
county
for
building
projects.
i’m
involved
with
an
application
right
now
and
i
know
that
rockland
county
is
one
of
the
two
counties
in
the
entire
state
of
new
york
where
there
say
you
don’t
have
to
make
20-year
projections
because
nobody
can
make
an
intelligent
20-year
projection
in
rockland
county.
that
are
growth
is
burgeoning
so
greatly
but
your
honor,
there
are
some
realistic
limitations
on
it
in
the
north
end
of
the
county
which
is
the
base
of
this
plan.
stony
point
is
something
in
excess
of
50%
state
rockland.
the
policy
states
them
to
state
park.
its
ability
to
grow
is
very
severely
limited.
but
the
county
is
going
to
continue
to
grow
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
idle
speculation
to
say
that
the
next
time
around
we
will
have
25
or
35
representatives
in
this
system.
and
it
is
very
possible
that
as
part
of
the
result,
we
may
end
up
with
exactly
the
situation
the
chief
judge
fuld
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
namely,
a
90%
or
an
80%
discrimination.
and
i
don’t
anyone
would
argue
that
that
is
a
good
plan
or
a
good
situation
to
have.
and
what
i’m
pleading
for
is
not
that
you
leave
the
door
open
for
people
to
come
back
and
sue
in
the
future.
my
lord!
we
have
enough
litigation
in
the
courts.
let’s
try
to
devise
plans
to
deal
with
reapportionment
and
rules
that
local
government
can
follow
that
will
ensure
that
we
don’t
have
a
constant
quarrel
and
constant
litigation
every
time
there
is
a
change
in
census.
and
i
think
this
plan
has
within
it
the
invidious
invitation
to
continuing
litigation.
and
i
mean
that
not
only
in
rockland
by
i
think
it
will
be
emulated
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
and
throughout
the
country
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
ahs
the
beauty
from
the
standpoint
of
those
who
are
in
local
government
now
and
who
have
dominated
the
structure,
the
desirability
of
maintaining
their
own.
counsel
has
talked
about
the
rational
state
policy
and
the
importance
of
the
town
and
the
town
supervisors.
he
didn’t
mention
the
fact
that
even
the
state
law
did
not
write
into
it
the
automatic
right
of
the
supervisor
to
seat
on
this
body
and
yet
this
county
legislature,
this
county
board
of
supervisors
in
endeavoring
to
preserve
itself,
not
to
secure
equality
of
representation
gentlemen
but
to
preserve
itself,
put
into
its
local
law
and
when
you
look
in
the
appendix
you’ll
see
it,
the
right
to
seat
not
because
they
are
elected
as
a
legislator
but
because
they
are
elected
as
a
supervisor.
well,
this
was
struck
down
even
in
new
york;
the
lower
courts
struck
this
down
right
from
the
beginning.
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
you
must
look
at
it
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
an
effort
was
being
made
here,
not
what
was
corrected
by
the
courts
because
we’re
talking
about
good
faith.
we’re
talking
about
good
faith
and
we’re
talking
about
good
faith
to
a
voter
and
a
citizen.
nobody
is
a
going
to
reduce
my
taxes
by
the
extent
that
my
vote
is
diminished
in
the
county
of
rockland.
and
yet
my
voice
and
my
vote
this
year
was
reduced
12%
or
11.9%.
next
year
8%.
next
year
perhaps
25%.
and
all
that
i
am
saying
is
that
my
vote
should
always
have
the
same
relationship
within
the
ability
of
men
to
achieve
it.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
effort
has
been
made
here
and
it
is
not
a
question
of
multi-member
districts
or
the
(inaudible)
ideas
of
a
professor
who
has
written
a
very
fascinating
article
on
the
square
root
of
something.
i’m
not
a
mathematician.
i’m
a
lawyer
and
i’m
a
voter
and
i’m
interested
in
government.
judge
stewart,
you
asked
the
question
this
morning
at
the
beginning
of
our
argument
relating
to
the
political
structure.
may
i
comment
on
it?
mr.
paul
h.
rivet
the
petitioners
here
represent
the
entire
spectrum
of
the
political
body.
responsible
leaders
of
the
republican
party,
responsible
leaders
in
the
democratic
party,
public
officials,
elected,
one
of
my
clients
is
a
councilman
in
the
town
of
orangetown,
and
the
petitioners
june
molof
and
others
are
essentially
the
league
of
women
voters
of
rockland
county.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
we
are
not
a
group
of
either
do-gooders
or
people
out
to
hone
an
ax.
we
are
all
seeking
an
effort
to
be
able
to
express
ourselves
fairly
with
equality
before
the
body
politic
and
we
have
been
frustrated
in
it.
mr.
justice
marshall
commented
on,
isn’t
it
better
to
have
a
one
to
one
relationship
because
you
know
who
to
look
to
when
you
have
a
problem
and
you
know
who
to
look
to
when
something
is
not
done.
well,
what
is
happening
now
and
we’re
having
a
circus
in
rockland
county
is
that
we
have
four
and
five
men
representing
40-50,000
people.
and
it’s
a
dreadful
situation
nobody
knows
who’s
responsible
for
what.
and
going
a
step
further,
i
realize
that
a
thousand
people
may
sound
like
very
little.
rockland
county,
despite
my
adversaries,
my
good
friend’s
brief
where
he
points
out
that
well,
you
can’t
divide
an
apartment
house.
rockland
county
is
not
a
county
of
apartment
houses.
this
is
a
county
of
residences.
and
when
we
talk
about
a
thousand
people,
we’re
talking
about
250
families,
250
homes.
that
is
a
very
large
development.
and
moving
a
line
involving
a
hundred
homes
is
not
a
difficult
line,
it
maybe
involved
moving
two
or
three
streets.
we’re
not
talking
about
running
a
line
down
the
(inaudible)
of
an
apartment
house.
there
isn’t
an
apartment
house
in
rockland
county
that
has
a
thousand
people
in
it.
i
doubt
if
there’s
one
in
rockland
county
to
have
more
than
250
people
in
it.
the
issue
is
not
arithmetic.
i
cannot
emphasize
that
too
strongly.
obviously,
we
can’t
win
an
argument
on
arithmetic.
i
mean
because
you
can
play
games
with
these
figures
from
now
until
tomorrow
afternoon
at
this
time,
and
we
would
never
come
to
a
conclusion.
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
wants
to
set
a
rule
where
you
say,
well,
you
can’t
have
more
than
1%
or
you
can’t
have
more
than
3%.
you
must
look
at
the
entire
picture.
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
you
recognize
rigid
boundary
lines
and
i
think
i
understand
why.
very
simply,
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
you
have
islands
divided
by
open
ocean,
in
some
cases,
50,
60
miles
apart.
obviously,
you
couldn’t
divide
a
man
of
course
that
greater
distance.
i
see
my
light
is
on
gentlemen.
