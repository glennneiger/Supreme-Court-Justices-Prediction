justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
was
that
chancery
division
injunction
entered
on
our
remand
of
the
case
in
the
brotherhood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
proceedings
in
the
chancery
court
then,
when
on
our
remand
under
justice
black’s
opinion
in
377?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
now,
what
was
the
record,
that
that
was
a
new
record
made
in
the
chancery
court
or
was
that
action
then
on
the
initial
record
that
we
had
considered
when
we
have
377
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
--
obviously
the
chancery
court
thought
the
decree
it
entered
was
consistent
with
our
opinion
on
the
remand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
is
that
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
it
this
way?
whether
provision
which
was
stricken
by
the
virginia
supreme
court;
that
does
not
appear
in
this
michigan
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
how
can
that
provision
be
before
us
for
consideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
mean,
i
gather
no
effort
was
made
in
michigan
to
have
the
trial
injunction
--
court’s
injunction
there
include
that
provision
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
just
one
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
whether
when
leave
was
denied
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
to
appeal
to
that
court
from
the
final
judgment
entered
by
the
richmond
chancery
court,
from
that
denial
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
the
union
attempt
to
certiorari
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
union
did
not
cross
petitioned
at
that
time
so
far
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
has
that
code
been
adapted
in
michigan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
say,
it’s
not
yet
acted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
not
yet
given
you
an
answer
after
your
session
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

would
you
mind
mr.

did
not
cross
petition
when
the
virginia
state
bar
brought
its
petition
here,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
did
not
seek
the
cert
here
when
leave
was
denied
to
appeal
from
the

finally
entered
in
the
richmond
chancery
court?
