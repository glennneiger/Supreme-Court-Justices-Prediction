mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
this
court.
we
have
in
this
case
i
believe
the
interesting
issue
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
--
of
the
decree
below
which
decree
is
exactly
duplicative
of
the
final
decree
in
the
virginia
brotherhood
case,
the
decree
of
the
state
court
of
virginia.
the
virginia
supreme
court
decision
in
207
virginia,
entirely
was
concerned
with
the
interpretation
and
the
consideration
of
what
it
considered
were
the
findings
and
opinion
of
this
court
in
this
court’s
brotherhood
decision.
now,
from
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
the
virginia
state
bar
made
an
application
to
this
court
for
certiorari
as
my
brother
indicated
which
was
supposed
by
the
brotherhood
and
that
petition
was
denied.
the
interesting
thing
i
believe
and
the
procedural
steps
in
the
two
cases,
i
think
need
a
little
consideration
in
order
to
keep
them
straight
and
i
have
found
it
helpful
to
me
to
put
in
chronological
order,
side-by-side
the
occurrences
in
the
michigan
case,
in
this
case
here
and
in
the
virginia
case.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
the
name
of
the
virginia
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
brotherhood,
namely,
state
bar
of
virginia
versus
the
brotherhood.
i
assume
justice
black
that
when
you
say
the
name
of
the
virginia
case
you’re
talking
about
the
title
before
the
virginia
supreme
court?
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
well
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
alright.
the
name
is
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
versus
commonwealth
of
virginia.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
it
is
207

now,
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
your
brotherhood
case?
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
that
was
on
march
6,
1968.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
no,
i
just
--
pardon
me.
virginia
state
bar’s
petition

law
edition
2nd

mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i
would
be
happy.
i
have
made
some
copies
of
this
chronology
of
the
michigan
case
and
the
virginia
case,
and
i
would
be
happy
to
give
these
to
your
honors
or
send
them
in
later
with
the
copies
to
counsel.
i
found
it
very
helpful
in
my
consideration
of
this
case
to
have
the
steps
that
occurred
from
time
to
time.
now
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
pardon?
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
thank
you
your
honor.
now,
in
both
the
petitioner’s
application
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
again
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
complaint
is
registered
that
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
not
comport
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
this
court’s
brotherhood
case,
and
that
because
of
what
occurred
in
the
state
of
virginia
after
the
brotherhood
case,
the
virginia
case
went
back
to
virginia.
it
has
been
deprived
of
a
review
of
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision.
and
the
reason
for
that,
petitioner
says,
after
the
virginia
supreme
court
rendered
its
decision
in
207
virginia,
in
which
--
which
was
a
decision
that
considered
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
holding
in
opinion
in
brotherhood.
it
considered
each
one
of
the
injunctive
provisions
of
the
second
or
1965
injunction
of
the
richmond
chancery
court,
and
the
entire
verbatim
injunction
of
the
richmond
chancery
court
of
1965
is
set
forth
in
the
--
in
footnote
4
in
the
opinion
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
and
certain
provisions
of
those
injunctive
paragraphs
are
put
in
italacies
for
emphasis
and
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision
was
to
strike
from
the
1965
injunction
which
is
quoted
in
footnote
4
as
being
repugnant
to
this
court’s
holding
in
brotherhood.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
actually
yes.
what
actually
happened
was
on
your
remand,
it
went
back
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
they
did
nothing
with
it,
but
remanded
it
down
to
the
virginia
--
i
mean,
the
richmond
chancery
court.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that.
on
the
initial
record,
was
it
mr.
naughton?
i’ll
accept
the
statement,
but
in
any
event,
the
richmond
chancery
court
then
entered
the
1965
decree
which
then
was
appealed
too.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
and
interesting
enough,
the
richmond
chancery
court
decree,
the
court’s
decree
felt
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
court’s
opinion
that
prevented
a
restraint
against
solicitation.
and
so
in
that
chancery
court’s
decree,
they
tried
to
draw
to
find
distinction
between
recommendation
and
solicitation.
and
that
was
one
of
the
subjects
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
been
spent
considerable
time
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
distinction,
set
forth
in
the
decree
of
the
chancery
court,
was
consistent
with
this
court’s
holding.
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
entire
provision
should
be
stricken,
saying
that
whatever
you
call
it,
recommendation
or
solicitation,
we
think
that
that
goes
beyond
the
constitutional
limitations
that's
set
forth
in
this
court’s
decision
in
the
brotherhood.
justice
carrico
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
dissented
and
felt
that
this
court
did
not
mean
that
in
its
--
in
your
brotherhood’s
decision,
and
he
hopefully
will
find
that
someday,
that
matter
would
be
decided
and
i
think,
this
is
the
case
that
it
will
be
--
that
the
--
the
other
interesting
thing
about
this
case
to
me
is
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
pardon?
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
well,
that
was
i
was
about
to
come
to.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
perhaps
only
inferentially
in
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
injunctive
provisions
that
are
in
the
lower
court’s
injunction
here,
being
exactly
duplicative
of
the
final
injunction
in
virginia,
whether
or
not
that
there’s
the
constitutional
abandonment
of
propriety
and
i
think
to
that
extent
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
you
are
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
you
are
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
was
endeavoring
to
cover
and
indicate
was
and
is
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
here
has
steadfastly
claimed
that
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
interpretation
of
your
brotherhood
decision
was
improper,
and
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
a
review
of
that
decision.
because
of
the
fact
that
after
the
virginia
supreme
court
sent
the
case
back
down
to
the
chancery
court
and
the
chancery
court
then
rendered
its
1965
decision
and
then
after
the
virginia
supreme
court
rendered
its
decision
in
207
virginia,
it
then
remanded
that
case
back
down
to
the
chancery
court
of
richmond
and
said
“here
it
is,
take
whatever
proceedings
you
consider
appropriate.”
and
so,
the
chancery
court
then
entered
a
new
third
injunctive
decree
exactly
in
the
terms
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
should
--
said
should
be
entered.
the
brotherhood
then
made
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
from
that
injunction
which
was
denied.
the
virginia
supreme
court
saying,
“no,
we
won’t
entertain
this
because
what
you
are
in
effect
doing
is
attempting
to
appeal
to
us
from
our
previous
decision.”
and
so,
the
point
is
made
by
the
petitioner
that
it
has
been
deprived
really
of
a
review
of
its
position
that
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
consistent
with
and
in
conformity
with
your
decision
in
brotherhood.
now,
because
of
what
occurred
in
michigan,
when
this
court
accepted
certiorari
in
the
brotherhood
case
and
our
case
was
then
on
its
way
to
and
had
landed
in
the
michigan
supreme
court,
and
because
the
issues
in
the
brotherhood
case
where
very
similar
to
at
that
time
very
similar
to
the
michigan
case,
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
a
short
opinion
remanded
it
to
the
jackson
circuit
court
awaiting
the
--
to
await
the
decision
of
this
court.
and
then
because
of
the
many
things
that
occurred
in
virginia
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brotherhood,
it
took
about
four
years
for
these
things
to
occur
in
virginia
until
a
final
injunction
in
virginia
was
finally
on
the
books
and
records.
then,
that
took
about
four
years
and
that’s
the
reason
why
this
case
was
delayed.
the
length
of
time
that
it
was
and
why
the
evidence,
up
to
the
year
1960
is
stale
according
to
what
the
petitioner
contends
in
this
case
and
a
decision
was
made
after
the
case
came
back
to
the
jackson
circuit
court
and
after
the
final
virginia
decree
had
become
final,
a
decision
was
made
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
state
bar
of
michigan
working
with
mr.
kelly
who
had
handled
this
case
in
collaboration
with
the
general
counsel
or
state
bar
not
to
introduce
any
additional
evidence,
but
to
ask
the
circuit
judge
based
upon
the
record
before
--
made
before
it
at
the
original
hearing
to
enter
a
decree
exactly
duplicative
of
the
final
decree
in
virginia.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
there
is
practically
a
ten-year
--
you
are
absolutely
right
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i
don’t
think
the
record
indicates
that,
no.
now,
this
case
presents
the
opportunity
for
this
court
to
do
three
things
which
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief
and
that
is
to
resolve
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
supreme
court
decision
--
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision
did
not
comply
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
brotherhood,
and
it
also
presents
this
court
with
the
opportunity
to
give
to
the
petitioner
the
review
that
it
claims
it
has
been
deprived
off
because
of
procedural
problems.
and
thirdly,
to
clarify
and
said
it
rests
the
concern
on
the
part
of
some
justices,
specifically
justice
carrico
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
a
large
segment
of
the
bar
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
it
did
not
and
the
reasons
for
that,
i
do
not
know.
i
can
only
surmised,
mr.
naughton
can
undoubtedly
tell
you
what
i
imagine
it
was
because
earlier
when
the
virginia
state
bar
made
an
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
here,
the
union
opposed
that.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
so
far
as
i
--
you
know
--
lastly
and
in
these
three
areas
that
i’ve
already
indicated
and
in
this
last
area,
we
agree
absolutely
with
the
petitioner’s
position
that
this
court
should
speak
out
in
a
very
definitive
terms
as
to
the
lengths
that
a
state
may
go
in
regulating
the
practice
of
law
in
these
areas,
particularly
in
light
of
new
rule
2-103
d5
of
the
new
professional
code
--
the
new
code
of
professional
responsibility,
because
that
provision
gives
the
specific
or
sets
forth
the
specific
exception,
consistent
with
constitutional
interpretations
and
referring
--
it
is
specifically
referred
to
there,
the
issues
and
the
questions
existing
here
by
reason
of
this
court’s
holding
in
button
and
brotherhood
and
mine
workers.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i’m
not
sure
just
exactly
how
much
i
put
in
my
brief
on
that,
but
i
should
advise
the
court
that
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
it
is
not
yet
acted
upon.
we
presented
to
the
michigan’s
--
in
michigan,
it
has
to
be
adopted
by
the
supreme
court.
we
had
a
special
committee
of
the
state
bar
review
the
code
and
they
presented
to
the
board
of
commissioners
their
recommendations
that
it
be
adopted
with
two
or
three
limitations,
not
in
this
area.
and
we
had
a
meeting
with
the
full
court
in
the
early
part
of
october
and
requested
that
the
court
adapt
the
code
as
we
had
recommended
with
two
slight
exceptions
not
material
here.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i’m
not
sure
that
it
is
because
if
i
understand
the
positioner
--
the
petitioner’s
petition
that
every
one
of
the
provisions,
generally,
they
make
the
claim
now
that
they’re
vague
and
they
claim
that
in
--
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
decree
would
chill
a
very
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
that
counsel
would
forthrightly
say
that
he
feels
as
they
have
set
forth
in
their
brief
that
every
one
of
these
provisions,
because
of
the
language
of
them,
restrict
the
full
operations
of
the
brotherhood’s
plan,
and
that
is
the
very
thing
that
we
are
concerned
about
because
we
feel
that
the
full
operations
of
the
plan
just
naturally
result
in
solicitation
of
the
fela
cases.
and
we
feel
that
it
is
absolutely
contrary
to
what
the
great
large
segments
of
the
bar
have
always
considered
as
improper,
and
we
feel
that
each
one
of
these
provisions
that
are
exactly
the
same
and
have
been
in
effect
in
virginia
since
1966
when
the
final
decree
was
finally
laid
on
the
books
there
has
been
no
chilling
or
restraint
upon
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
brotherhood.
and
that
therefore,
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
--
of
the
court
below.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
that
is
correct.
i
guess
i
didn’t
conclude
my
answer.
i
meant
to
say
that
undoubtedly,
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
if
i
may
say
so.
we
had
a
change
of
two
members
on
the
michigan
supreme
court
as
of
january
1,
including
a
change
in
the
chief
justice.
and
our
new
chief
justice
had
voiced
his
feelings
somewhat
strongly
during
our
meeting
with
them
in
october
as
having
some
concern
about
some
provisions
of
the
code
not
material
here,
but
i
gather
that
because
of
that,
there
has
been
a
delay
in
making
a
decision
on
the
code.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
this
court.
we
have
in
this
case
i
believe
the
interesting
issue
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
--
of
the
decree
below
which
decree
is
exactly
duplicative
of
the
final
decree
in
the
virginia
brotherhood
case,
the
decree
of
the
state
court
of
virginia.
the
virginia
supreme
court
decision
in
207
virginia,
entirely
was
concerned
with
the
interpretation
and
the
consideration
of
what
it
considered
were
the
findings
and
opinion
of
this
court
in
this
court’s
brotherhood
decision.
now,
from
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
the
virginia
state
bar
made
an
application
to
this
court
for
certiorari
as
my
brother
indicated
which
was
supposed
by
the
brotherhood
and
that
petition
was
denied.
the
interesting
thing
i
believe
and
the
procedural
steps
in
the
two
cases,
i
think
need
a
little
consideration
in
order
to
keep
them
straight
and
i
have
found
it
helpful
to
me
to
put
in
chronological
order,
side-by-side
the
occurrences
in
the
michigan
case,
in
this
case
here
and
in
the
virginia
case.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
the
name
of
the
virginia
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
brotherhood,
namely,
state
bar
of
virginia
versus
the
brotherhood.
i
assume
justice
black
that
when
you
say
the
name
of
the
virginia
case
you’re
talking
about
the
title
before
the
virginia
supreme
court?
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
well
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
alright.
the
name
is
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
versus
commonwealth
of

mr.

i
would

happy.
i
have
made
some
copies
of
this

of
the

and
the

and
i
would
be
happy
to
give
these
to
your
honors
or
send
them
in
later
with
the
copies
to
counsel.
i
found
it
very
helpful
in
my
consideration
of
this
case
to
have
the
steps
that
occurred
from
time
to
time.
now
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
pardon?
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
thank
you
your
honor.
now,
in
both
the
petitioner’s
application
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
again
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
complaint
is
registered
that
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
not
comport
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
this
court’s
brotherhood
case,
and
that
because
of
what
occurred
in
the
state
of
virginia
after
the
brotherhood
case,
the
virginia
case
went
back
to
virginia.
it
has
been
deprived
of
a
review
of
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision.
and
the
reason
for
that,
petitioner
says,
after
the
virginia
supreme
court
rendered
its
decision
in
207
virginia,
in
which
--
which
was
a
decision
that
considered
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
holding
in
opinion
in
brotherhood.
it
considered
each
one
of
the
injunctive
provisions
of
the
second
or
1965
injunction
of
the
richmond
chancery
court,
and
the
entire
verbatim
injunction
of
the
richmond
chancery
court
of
1965
is
set
forth
in
the
--
in
footnote
4
in
the
opinion
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
and
certain
provisions
of
those
injunctive
paragraphs
are
put
in
italacies
for
emphasis
and
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision
was
to
strike
from
the
1965
injunction
which
is
quoted
in
footnote
4
as
being
repugnant
to
this
court’s
holding
in
brotherhood.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
actually
yes.
what
actually
happened
was
on
your
remand,
it
went
back
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
they
did
nothing
with
it,
but
remanded
it
down
to
the
virginia
--
i
mean,
the
richmond
chancery
court.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that.
on
the
initial
record,
was
it
mr.
naughton?
i’ll
accept
the
statement,
but
in
any
event,
the
richmond
chancery
court
then
entered
the
1965
decree
which
then
was
appealed
too.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
and
interesting
enough,
the
richmond
chancery
court
decree,
the
court’s
decree
felt
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
court’s
opinion
that
prevented
a
restraint
against
solicitation.
and
so
in
that
chancery
court’s
decree,
they
tried
to
draw
to
find
distinction
between
recommendation
and
solicitation.
and
that
was
one
of
the
subjects
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
been
spent
considerable
time
in
determining
whether
or
not
that
distinction,
set
forth
in
the
decree
of
the
chancery
court,
was
consistent
with
this
court’s
holding.
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
entire
provision
should
be
stricken,
saying
that
whatever
you
call
it,
recommendation
or
solicitation,
we
think
that
that
goes
beyond
the
constitutional
limitations
that's
set
forth
in
this
court’s
decision
in
the
brotherhood.
justice
carrico
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
dissented
and
felt
that
this
court
did
not
mean
that
in
its
--
in
your
brotherhood’s
decision,
and
he
hopefully
will
find
that
someday,
that
matter
would
be
decided
and
i
think,
this
is
the
case
that
it
will
be
--
that
the
--
the
other
interesting
thing
about
this
case
to
me
is
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
pardon?
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
well,
that
was
i
was
about
to
come
to.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
perhaps
only
inferentially
in
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
injunctive
provisions
that
are
in
the
lower
court’s
injunction
here,
being
exactly
duplicative
of
the
final
injunction
in
virginia,
whether
or
not
that
there’s
the
constitutional
abandonment
of
propriety
and
i
think
to
that
extent
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
you
are
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
you
are
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
was
endeavoring
to
cover
and
indicate
was
and
is
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
here
has
steadfastly
claimed
that
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
interpretation
of
your
brotherhood
decision
was
improper,
and
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
a
review
of
that
decision.
because
of
the
fact
that
after
the
virginia
supreme
court
sent
the
case
back
down
to
the
chancery
court
and
the
chancery
court
then
rendered
its
1965
decision
and
then
after
the
virginia
supreme
court
rendered
its
decision
in
207
virginia,
it
then
remanded
that
case
back
down
to
the
chancery
court
of
richmond
and
said
“here
it
is,
take
whatever
proceedings
you
consider
appropriate.”
and
so,
the
chancery
court
then
entered
a
new
third
injunctive
decree
exactly
in
the
terms
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
should
--
said
should
be
entered.
the
brotherhood
then
made
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
from
that
injunction
which
was
denied.
the
virginia
supreme
court
saying,
“no,
we
won’t
entertain
this
because
what
you
are
in
effect
doing
is
attempting
to
appeal
to
us
from
our
previous
decision.”
and
so,
the
point
is
made
by
the
petitioner
that
it
has
been
deprived
really
of
a
review
of
its
position
that
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
consistent
with
and
in
conformity
with
your
decision
in
brotherhood.
now,
because
of
what
occurred
in
michigan,
when
this
court
accepted
certiorari
in
the
brotherhood
case
and
our
case
was
then
on
its
way
to
and
had
landed
in
the
michigan
supreme
court,
and
because
the
issues
in
the
brotherhood
case
where
very
similar
to
at
that
time
very
similar
to
the
michigan
case,
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
a
short
opinion
remanded
it
to
the
jackson
circuit
court
awaiting
the
--
to
await
the
decision
of
this
court.
and
then
because
of
the
many
things
that
occurred
in
virginia
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brotherhood,
it
took
about
four
years
for
these
things
to
occur
in
virginia
until
a
final
injunction
in
virginia
was
finally
on
the
books
and
records.
then,
that
took
about
four
years
and
that’s
the
reason
why
this
case
was
delayed.
the
length
of
time
that
it
was
and
why
the
evidence,
up
to
the
year
1960
is
stale
according
to
what
the
petitioner
contends
in
this
case
and
a
decision
was
made
after
the
case
came
back
to
the
jackson
circuit
court
and
after
the
final
virginia
decree
had
become
final,
a
decision
was
made
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
state
bar
of
michigan
working
with
mr.
kelly
who
had
handled
this
case
in
collaboration
with
the
general
counsel
or
state
bar
not
to
introduce
any
additional
evidence,
but
to
ask
the
circuit
judge
based
upon
the
record
before
--
made
before
it
at
the
original
hearing
to
enter
a
decree
exactly
duplicative
of
the
final
decree
in
virginia.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
there
is
practically
a
ten-year
--
you
are
absolutely
right
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i
don’t
think
the
record
indicates
that,
no.
now,
this
case
presents
the
opportunity
for
this
court
to
do
three
things
which
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief
and
that
is
to
resolve
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
supreme
court
decision
--
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
decision
did
not
comply
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
brotherhood,
and
it
also
presents
this
court
with
the
opportunity
to
give
to
the
petitioner
the
review
that
it
claims
it
has
been
deprived
off
because
of
procedural
problems.
and
thirdly,
to
clarify
and
said
it
rests
the
concern
on
the
part
of
some
justices,
specifically
justice
carrico
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
and
a
large
segment
of
the
bar
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
yes.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
it
did
not
and
the
reasons
for
that,
i
do
not
know.
i
can
only
surmised,
mr.
naughton
can
undoubtedly
tell
you
what
i
imagine
it
was
because
earlier
when
the
virginia
state
bar
made
an
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
here,
the
union
opposed
that.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
so
far
as
i
--
you
know
--
lastly
and
in
these
three
areas
that
i’ve
already
indicated
and
in
this
last
area,
we
agree
absolutely
with
the
petitioner’s
position
that
this
court
should
speak
out
in
a
very
definitive
terms
as
to
the
lengths
that
a
state
may
go
in
regulating
the
practice
of
law
in
these
areas,
particularly
in
light
of
new
rule
2-103
d5
of
the
new
professional
code
--
the
new
code
of
professional
responsibility,
because
that
provision
gives
the
specific
or
sets
forth
the
specific
exception,
consistent
with
constitutional
interpretations
and
referring
--
it
is
specifically
referred
to
there,
the
issues
and
the
questions
existing
here
by
reason
of
this
court’s
holding
in
button
and
brotherhood
and
mine
workers.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i’m
not
sure
just
exactly
how
much
i
put
in
my
brief
on
that,
but
i
should
advise
the
court
that
--
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
it
is
not
yet
acted
upon.
we
presented
to
the
michigan’s
--
in
michigan,
it
has
to
be
adopted
by
the
supreme
court.
we
had
a
special
committee
of
the
state
bar
review
the
code
and
they
presented
to
the
board
of
commissioners
their
recommendations
that
it
be
adopted
with
two
or
three
limitations,
not
in
this
area.
and
we
had
a
meeting
with
the
full
court
in
the
early
part
of
october
and
requested
that
the
court
adapt
the
code
as
we
had
recommended
with
two
slight
exceptions
not
material
here.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
i’m
not
sure
that
it
is
because
if
i
understand
the
positioner
--
the
petitioner’s
petition
that
every
one
of
the
provisions,
generally,
they
make
the
claim
now
that
they’re
vague
and
they
claim
that
in
--
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
decree
would
chill
a
very
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
that
counsel
would
forthrightly
say
that
he
feels
as
they
have
set
forth
in
their
brief
that
every
one
of
these
provisions,
because
of
the
language
of
them,
restrict
the
full
operations
of
the
brotherhood’s
plan,
and
that
is
the
very
thing
that
we
are
concerned
about
because
we
feel
that
the
full
operations
of
the
plan
just
naturally
result
in
solicitation
of
the
fela
cases.
and
we
feel
that
it
is
absolutely
contrary
to
what
the
great
large
segments
of
the
bar
have
always
considered
as
improper,
and
we
feel
that
each
one
of
these
provisions
that
are
exactly
the
same
and
have
been
in
effect
in
virginia
since
1966
when
the
final
decree
was
finally
laid
on
the
books
there
has
been
no
chilling
or
restraint
upon
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
brotherhood.
and
that
therefore,
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
--
of
the
court
below.
mr.
a.
d.
ruegsegger
that
is
correct.
i
guess
i
didn’t
conclude
my
answer.
i
meant
to
say
that
undoubtedly,
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
if
i
may
say
so.
we
had
a
change
of
two
members
on
the
michigan
supreme
court
as
of
january
1,
including
a
change
in
the
chief
justice.
and
our
new
chief
justice
had
voiced
his
feelings
somewhat
strongly
during
our
meeting
with
them
in
october
as
having
some
concern
about
some
provisions
of
the
code
not
material
here,
but
i
gather
that
because
of
that,
there
has
been
a
delay
in
making
a
decision
on
the
code.
thank
you,
your
honors.
