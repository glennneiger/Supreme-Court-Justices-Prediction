mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
the
second
dealing
by
this
court
with
the
legal
aid
or
legal
service
plan
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
the
petitioner
here
comes
under
the
different
name
of
the
united
transportation
union,
but
the
reason
for
that
is
solely
because
of
the
trainmen
has
been
merged
into
that
successor
union.
at
all
times
that
the
injunctions
were
issued
in
this
case,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
was
the
defendant
on
the
appeal
to
the
michigan
supreme
court,
the
merger
into
the
surviving
union
were
quashed.
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
are
whether
the
injunction
issued
deprives
the
union
members
of
rights
arguably
guaranteed
by
this
court
in
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
or
whether
those
injunctive
probations
are
contrary
to
the
this
court’s
subsequent
opinion
in
mine
workers
versus
illinois
state
bar
association.
alternatively,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
proceedings
after
remand
on
the
first
appeal
by
michigan
supreme
court
were
such
as
to
deprive
the
union
of
its
constitutional
right
the
procedure
of
due
process.
this
case
begun
with
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
1959,
and
basically
that
complaint
paraphrases
some
of
the
language
and
the
holdings
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
opinion
of
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
in
fact,
one
of
the
defenses
of
the
brotherhood
to
the
complaint
was
at
the
case
was
moot
because
of
the
fact
that
it
had
complied
with
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
in
that
defense,
the
brotherhood
alleged
that
the
state
bar
of
michigan
had
presented
evidence
before
the
illinois
supreme
court.
that
allegation
was
not
denied
in
the
reply
and
indeed
during
the
trial
in
1961,
the
counsel
for
the
state
bar
at
appendix
39
and
40
stated
that
its
evidence
and
its
charges
were
presented
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
and
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
there
should
be
no
further
proceeding
on
those
charges.
nevertheless,
before
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
by
its
terms
became
effective,
which
was
to
be
on
july
1,
1959,
the
state
bar
filed
this
complaint.
basically,
the
state
bar
claimed
that
the
brotherhood
had
a
plan
of
recommending
and
urging
that
its
members
seek
legal
advice,
and
not
only
seek
legal
advice
but
retraining
of
the
union
counsel.
the
union
admitted
such
in
its
answer.
the
state
bar
alleged
that
a
majority
of
such
federal
employers’
liability
act
cases
went
to
the
union
counsel.
the
union
denied
that
allegation,
but
did
admit
that
in
some
cases
but
not
in
all
and
they
went
to
such
counsel.
the
possibility
of
a
consent
decree
proving
fruitless,
the
case
went
to
trial.
and
at
trial,
the
counsel
for
the
state
bars
said
the
only
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
or
not
large
numbers
of
cases
went
to
the
legal
counsel
of
the
union.
so,
he
proceeded
to
prove
through
only
one
witness,
a
man
by
the
name
of
walsh
who
was
employed
by
the
association
of
american
railroads
claims
research
bureau,
and
who
in
such
employment
received
reports
from
other
railroads
as
to
how
many
cases,
the
appellee
cases,
were
handled
by
various
attorneys
where
the
residents
were
michigan
residents.
the
witness
also
testified
in
appendix
102
that
since
1953,
the
association
of
american
railroads
had
been
the
chief
investigating
agency
for
the
state
bar
and
had
been
in
the
michigan
state
seeking
evidence.
after
the
hearing,
briefs
were
filed
and
the
1962
virginia
decree
was
handed
down
by
the
chancellor
of
the
--
of
its
chancery
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
after
the
briefs,
there
was
a
1962
injunction
decree
issued
in
this
case.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
the
brotherhood
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
this
court
handed
down
its
opinion
in
1964
brotherhood.
the
michigan
supreme
court
after
being
informed
of
the
opinion
of
this
court,
reversed
and
remanded,
and
specifically
stated
that
permission
for
the
amendment
of
the
plaintiff’s
bill
to
seek,
if
it
be
so
advised,
relief
not
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
opinion
in
1964
brotherhood.
the
next
action
of
the
trial
court
was
a
motion
for
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
a
1965
injunction
decree
of
the
city
court
of
richmond
and
that
motion
was
not
acted
upon.
in
1966,
the
virginia
supreme
court
entered
its
opinion
on
the
appeal
from
the
1965
decree
and
reversed
the
part
of
that
opinion
which
attempted
to
draw
a
line
between
solicitation,
and
between
recommendation
and
urging.
the
state
bar
of
virginia,
petition
for
a
certiorari
to
this
court
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
opposed
the
petition.
the
petition
was
denied.
in
1967,
this
court
handed
down
it
mine
worker’s
decision.
and
following
that
decision,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
handed
down
the
1968
decree
which
is
now
before
this
court.
in
handing
down
that
decree,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
stated
that
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
reading
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
brotherhood
was
sufficient
to
warrant
the
promulgating
of
the
decree
in
this
case.
as
to
the
mine
worker’s
decision
which
was
brought
to
its
attention,
it
said
that
it’s
irrelevant
that
the
mine
worker’s
decision
dealt
only
with
the
financial
connection.
there
was
then
a
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan,
and
that
is
that
judgment
immediately
below.
by
4
to
3
decision,
the
michigan
supreme
court
affirmed
the
judgment.
it
did
not
look
at
the
injunctive
provisions.
instead,
it
proceeded
upon
a
analysis
of
this
court’s
1964
brotherhood
opinion
as
it
was
stated
by
the
virginia
supreme
court.
accepting
that
analysis,
it
stated
that
it
would
defend
its
understanding
of
the
tenants
of
equal
justice
under
law
if
the
brotherhood
were
to
receive
more
relief
in
michigan
then
it
had
already
obtained
in
virginia.
indeed,
it
said
that
absence
a
specific
order
from
washington
it
would
not
enter
such
an
order
or
a
judgment.
the
dissent
agreed
with
the
contention
of
petitioner
here.
it
stated
that
the
decree
could
not
be
entered
because
of
this
court’s
decision
in
1964
brotherhood,
and
said
even
if
that
were
not
so,
it
would
say
that
the
mine
workers’
case
was
sufficient
to
bar
the
entry
of
the
decree.
and
finally
under
michigan
law,
it
stated
that
the
proofs
was
stale,
the
pleadings
was
stale
and
that
there
was
no
clear
and
convincing
proof
of
any
violations,
and
therefore
under
michigan
law,
it
should
not
have
entered.
we
then
turn
to
the
first
question
of
this
case,
whether
or
not
that
this
decree
is
contrary
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
1964
brotherhood.
in
that
opinion
as
in
many
other
opinions
dealing
with
free
speech,
this
court
has
consistently
stated
a
rule
of
law
which
was
ignored
in
this
case.
the
burden
this
court
has
stated
and
very
clearly
and
very
directly
so
far
as
i’m
concern
is
upon
the
state
bar
to
prove
substantive
evils.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
proof
of
any
substantive
evil,
indeed,
there
was
no
updating
of
the
complaint
or
any
other
updating
of
the
proof.
the
proof
in
this
case
relates
at
the
very
latest
to
the
year
of
1960.
when
the
petitioner
here
requested
that
there
be
an
amending
of
the
complaint,
so
that
there
could
be
a
sharpening
of
the
issues,
that
request
was
ignored
despite
the
language
in
the
first
michigan
supreme
court
opinion
which
stated
that
permission
was
granted
for
leave
to
amend.
in
the
second
supreme
court
opinion
where
the
--
that
court
stated
in
the
majority
opinion
that
the
right
to
amend
was
an
alternative
and
that
the
state
bar
did
not
have
to
avail
itself
of
the
accorded
right
to
amend,
indeed,
it
didn’t
avail
itself
of
the
accorded
right
to
amend.
it’s
the
counsel
at
one
point
stated
that
he
did
not
choose
to
amend.
until
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
at
spoke,
it
was
unknown
to
this
petitioner
that
there
was
any
alternative
whatsoever.
assuming
that
there
was
such
an
alternative,
it
would
seem
that
this
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
turning
again
to
the
brotherhood
case,
that
case
held
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
united
states
report
that
this
case
did
not
involve
ambulance
chasing,
it
did
not
involve
unauthorized
practice,
it
did
not
involve
the
commercialization
of
the
legal
profession.
the
contention
of
the
respondent
and
of
the
court
below
seems
to
be
directly
contradictory
to
that
language
of
this
court.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
in
the
1964
brotherhood
opinion,
we
asserted
that
there
were
and
in
fact,
the
virginia
case
in
one
of
its
findings
held
that
all
of
the
cases
or
substantially
all
of
them
were
channeled
through
legal
counsel.
in
this
case,
the
allegation
was
the
majority,
but
the
proof
failed
to
prove
any
majority
and
the
finding
was
that
a
large
number.
and
in
fact,
the
finding
does
not
really
show
a
large
number.
at
page
168
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
summary
sheet
which
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
17
which
shows
a
summary
of
the
evidence
presented
through
the
association
of
american
railroads.
and
as
your
honor
will
note
the
bottom
line
deals
with
the
year
1960,
the
latest
year
and
shows
a
total
number
of
fela
cases.
34
of
those,
in
the
second
column,
only
6
were
handled
by
the
legal
counsel,
20
by
michigan
attorneys
and
8
by
other
attorneys.
the
only
substantial
amount
of
cases
shown
is
in
the
first
line
which
is
july
1,
1953
to
march
31,
1955.
there,
is
a
197
cases
of
which
a
126
supposedly
went
to
the
firm,
to
the
legal
counsel
firm,
but
when
the
data
on
which
that
summary
is
based
is
examined,
it's
seen
that
this
numbers
of
cases
does
not
deal
with
53,
but
instead
deals
with
the
great
number
of
years.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
plaintiff’s
exhibit
4
i
believe
it
is;
plaintiffs’
exhibit
3
shows
great
numbers
of
cases
which
were
undated.
and
then,
shows
for
the
legal
counsel
45
settlements,
46
settlements,
47
settlements,
and
48,
49,
50,
51,
52,
and
then
goes
into
the
53
settlements.
now
reason
for
that
was
that
in
1953,
the
association
of
american
railroads
formed
this
claims
research
bureau
which
went
out
to
obtain
evidence
against
various
counsel.
and
as
a
starter,
they
had
these
cards
signed
in
from
the
various
railroads
so
the
first
cards
that
came
in
dealt
with
many
another
years
outside
of
the
years
within
the
exhibit
of
53
through
55.
it’s
also
i
believe
note
worthy
that
primarily
those
earlier
years
are
shown
are
the
legal
counsel
cases.
any
cases
by
other
counsel
are
not
shown
by
year.
and
so,
it
creates
a
problem
is
to
whether
this
is
selected
evidence
or
not,
but
be
that
as
it
may
and
we
always
have
had
in
this
virginia
case
and
in
the
michigan
case,
questions
as
to
the
substantial
evidence
backing
any
of
the
injunctive
provisions.
the
fact
remains
that
the
state
bar's
own
exhibits
show
immediately
preceding
the
issuance
of
the
first
injunction,
a
very
minor
number
of
cases
handled
by
the
legal
counsel’s
firm.
i
don’t’
think
that
i
need
to
belabor
the
proposition
that
there
has
been
shifting
of
the
burden
here
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
by
the
court
below.
if
i
have
not
adequately
set
it
out
in
my
brief,
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
brief
for
the
amicus,
the
flcio
clearly
and
succinctly
shows
what
is
required
here.
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
particularly
note
page
7
of
the
that
brief
where
the
amicus
states
that
the
restrictions
on
group
legal
practice
plans
must
be
justified
by
proof,
tending
to
show
that
the
practice
which
is
enjoined
is
quote
“an
oppressive,
malicious
or
aberratious
use
of
the
legal
process
for
purely
private
gain,”
quoting
this
court’s
opinion
in
naacp
versus
button,
and
then
the
commercialization
language
from
the
trainmen
opinion.
i
think
that
being
the
standard
that
there
is
a
complete
failure
of
proof
in
this
case
whether
it’s
judged
as
of
1960,
or
as
of
1968
when
this
injunction
was
issued.
that
seems
also
to
me
that
the
mine
workers
decision
adds
a
further
reason
why
this
case
should
be
reversed.
in
mine
workers
as
this
court
were
recall
the
union
counsel
was
on
a
salary
and
all
of
the
cases
went
to
him
without
any
further
compensation.
indeed,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
fact
that
he
filled
out
an
injury
form
was
sufficient
to
cause
the
legal
counsel
to
begin
processing
the
workmen’s
compensation
claim
in
that
case.
that
case
also
was
completely
an
unauthorized
practice
of
law
case,
and
that
seems
to
be
the
principle
defense
of
the
state
bar
as
to
the
injunction
here
is
that
we
are
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law,
although,
there
was
no
such
allegation
in
the
only
complaint
file
below.
that
mine
workers
case,
i
think
is
also
particularly
relevant
on
the
first
injunctive
provision
about
which
we
complaint.
the
injunctive
provisions
are
set
out
at
appendix
176
and
177,
also
set
out
various
points
in
the
brief.
the
first
provision
enjoined
the
union
from
giving
or
furnishing
legal
advice.
now,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
for
reason
which
we
state
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
and
thereafter
that
this
is
not
part
of
the
brotherhood’s
plan.
the
brotherhood’s
plan
is
exactly
opposite.
it’s
not
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
the
union
is
not
practicing
law.
the
union
is
sending
the
cases
to
the
union
lawyer
and
saying
that
the
lawyer
practices
law.
this
is
the
practice
of
law.
it’s
a
new
definition
of
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
typically,
that
arises
when
the
corporation
itself
acts
through
lawyers
and
the
lawyers
are
merely
agents.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
retainer
contract
is
entered
the
too
between
the
injured
employee
and
the
lawyer,
and
then
that,
that
becomes
a
simple
handling
of
a
case
by
a
lawyer-client
relationship.
there’s
been
no
proof
either
in
virginia
or
here
that
anything
else
occurs.
the
second
provision
it
seems
to
me
also
is
such
that
it
would
strike
as
it
could
be
interpreted,
and
that’s
an
ambiguous
section
against
the
operation
of
this
plan.
that
prohibits
informing
any
lawyer
or
lawyers
that
an
accident
has
been
suffered
by
a
member
in
furnishing
the
name
and
address
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
legal
employment
for
any
lawyer.
and
this
i
think,
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
brotherhood’s
plan
at
it
reads.
as
virginia
interpreted,
it
seems
to
be
a
method
of
subverting
this
court’s
language
in
trainmen.
in
trainmen,
this
court's
stated
that
of
course,
counsel
had
the
same
right
to
accept
the
cases
that
the
union
had
in
channeling
the
cases.
virginia
recognized
that
language,
but
stated
that
it
did
not
interpreted
as
such
that
would
permit
the
lawyer
to
do
more
than
accept
and
rather
intend
it
to
bring
injunction
actions
or
disbarment
action
against
any
lawyer
who
did
anymore
than
accept,
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
stricken
down.
the
third
provision
deals
with
the
defraying
of
expenses;
that
is
from
stating
that
they
will
suggest
or
defray.
i
don’t
know
that
this
is
part
of
the
brotherhood
plan.
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
it
in
any
event
and
finally
under
illinois
law
which
is
the
state
which
the
legal
counsel
in
this
case
practices,
that’s
permitted
after
a
retainer
is
obtained.
the
fourth
provision
from
controlling
directly
or
indirectly
to
fees
charged,
it
seems
to
me
they
have
stricken
down
by
the
mine
workers
case
because
you
can
place
a
lawyer
on
a
salary
and
not
be
guilty
of
any
violations.
constitutionally,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
have
the
right
to
do
less
than
that,
and
that
is
to
do
what
the
union
used
to
do
in
this
case
to
limit
the
counsel’s
fee
to
25%.
the
fifth
injunctive
provision
is
a
rather
peculiar
one.
it
prohibits
accepting
or
receiving
compensation
of
any
kind
directly
or
indirectly
for
the
solicitation
of
legal
employment
for
any
lawyer.
now,
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
that
there
could
be
no
decree
which
prohibit
solicitation.
but
yet,
it
let
this
provision
stand
which
does
not
prohibits
solicitation,
but
prohibits
solicitation
plus
the
receiving
of
compensation
as
i
read
it,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
this
and
it
would
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
most
peculiar
ambiguous
section
that
should
be
stricken
down.
the
remainders
of
these
provisions
are
such
that
they
deal
with
financial
connections
of
the
some
sort.
i
would
like
to
particularly
note
that
the
last
one
from
sharing
in
any
recovery
for
personal
injury
or
death
by
gift
assignment
or
otherwise
is
brand
new
one.
it
was
not
in
the
1962
virginia
decree.
it
was
added
in
1965
by
the
chancellor
for
some
reason
because
in
that
case,
there
was
no
additional
evidence
taken
either.
now,
turning
to
the
question
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
we
have
to
generally
deal
with
the
michigan
statute
which
i
suppose
is
that
basis
on
which
this
injunction
is
issued.
it’s
the
--
the
only
thing
in
the
complaint
under
which
they
justify
the
issuance
of
the
1961
injunction,
on
page
32,
we
set
out
the
interpretation
of
that
statute
by
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
in
hightower
versus
detroit
edison
company,
which
the
court
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
discourage
the
practice
commonly
known
as
ambulance
chasing.
and
then
stated
that
there
were
four
separate
indications
of
it,
full
meaning
litigation,
subornation
of
perjury,
molting
of
innocent
persons
by
judgment
upon
manufactured
causes
of
action
or
defrauding
of
injured
persons,
having
proper
causes
of
action,
but
ignoring
their
legal
rights
by
means
of
contracts
which
retain
exorbitant
percentages
of
recovery.
now
in
this
case,
the
percentage
of
recovery
in
the
illinois
case
was
the
25%
than
prevalent
in
the
brotherhood
counsel.
and
that
was
stricken
down
by
the
illinois
court
because
it
was
undercutting
of
fees
rather
than
charging
of
exorbitant
fees.
so,
it
seemed
to
me
under
the
michigan
supreme
court's
reading
of
that
statute,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
there
was
any
violation
of
the
statute.
but
even
assuming
that
the
michigan
statute
can
be
read
to
cover
the
facts
in
this
case
which
strongly
submit
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
naacp
versus
button
with
dealing
with
a
similar
statute
would
require
it
striking
down.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
not
that
i
know
off,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no.
not
such
as
you
have
in
new
york.
the
remainder
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
devote
to
the
problem
which
it
seems
is
raised
in
this
case
by
the
reaction
of
the
courts
after
remand.
that
problem
is
the
problem
of
whether
the
union
after
remand
received
procedural
due
process.
after
remand,
if
the
brotherhood
wished
an
updating
of
the
complaint,
an
updating
of
the
proof.
indeed,
it
wished
an
opportunity
to
present
some
evidence
because
as
the
record
shows,
in
the
1961
hearing,
after
the
close
of
the
state
bar’s
evidence,
the
brotherhood
rested
without
presenting
any
evidence
upon
the
ground
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
showing
of
any
reason
for
an
injunction.
so,
we
are
now
faced
with
this
injunction
which
was
taken
from
virginia
and
as
to
that
injunction,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence.
there
is
no
contemporaneous
pleading.
there
are
no
allegations
of
the
provisions
in
the
injunction.
and
surprisingly
when
they
copied
the
virginia
injunction,
they
did
not
copy
the
findings
of
facts,
so
if
you
have
an
injunction
without
any
findings
of
fact.
the
findings
of
facts
that
now
remain
in
virginia
are
the
finding
of
facts
that
were
made
in
the
1962,
the
decree.
the
court
there
took
the
position
of
this
court’s
judgment
did
not
affect
the
findings
of
fact.
so
therefore,
you
have
the
problem
there
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
directly
contradictory
of
many
of
this
court’s
holdings.
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
1961
michigan
decree
do
not
apply
to
these
particular
injunctive
provisions.
on
this
procedural
due
process
point,
we
would
submit
that
the
ruffalo
case
by
this
court
requiring
a
fair
notice
of
reach
of
the
procedure
and
also
the
precise
nature
of
the
charges
is
directly
irrelevant.
we
would
also
submit
that
the
wilmer
case
by
this
court
requiring
a
hearing
so
that
there
could
be
a
rebuttal
of
any
charges
is
directly
irrelevant,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
general
injunctive
law
is
status
stated
in
our
brief
is
directly
relevant
here
and
as
accordance
with
the
conditional
standards
which
this
court
has
promulgated
in
the
brotherhood
and
in
mine
workers.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
correct
also,
your
honor.
my
reasons
for
that
were
that
i
thought
both
of
them
were
really
not
right
for
decision
by
this
court
at
first
because
i
didn’t
believe
it
was
a
final
judgment,
although
i
was
told
there
it
was.
and
then
the
second
time,
it
was
a
technical
since
the
court
below
claimed
that
it
was
not
appealable
under
virginia
law.
in
any
event,
the
virginia
supreme
court
interpretation
of
this
court’s
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
it’s
interpretation
and
i
would
not
presume
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
it’s
at
all
definitive
reminding
on
it.
the
courts
below
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
that
that
court’s
opinion
and
your
opinion
is
the
last
word,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
would
like
to
mention
that
in
regard
to
the
rehearing
in
virginia
when
we
came
back
down,
there
was
a
new
chancellor,
and
the
chancellor
who
heard
the
first
virginia
case
in
1962
and
issued
that
decree
had
retired
and
the
1965
decree
and
the
1967
decree
were
entered
by
a
chancellor
who
did
not
hear
the
evidence.
the
question
as
to
the
new
code
of
professional
responsibility,
i
think
is
pertinent
here.
i
don’t
feel
i’ll
go
quite
as
far
as
my
position
was
represented
by
the
state
bar,
that
new
cannon
says
that
it’s
a
lawyer’s
duty
to
see
that
legal
business
is
widely
disseminated
and
the
actual
language
is
that
a
lawyer
should
assist
the
legal
profession
fulfilling
its
duty
to
make
legal
counsel
available.
however,
it
does
have
a
caveat
in
it
that
legal
services
claims
while
you
can
tell
the
people
that
they
have
lawsuits,
you
must
not
take
the
case
unless
you’re
constitutionally
protected.
it
has
been
criticized
and
saying
that
the
bar
associations
are
willing
to
recognize
their
perspective
client’s
constitutional
rights,
but
no
other
rights.
i
think
that
for
that
reason,
this
court
should
be
clear
in
delineating
what
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
brother
here
and
of
other
legal
service
group
says
in
this
case.
the
question
as
to
no
chilling
in
virginia,
i
don’t
--
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record,
of
course,
as
to
whether
there’s
any
chilling
in
virginia
or
not,
the
virginia
case
in
1962
was
not
based
on
any
evidence
as
to
virginia.
i
don’t
know
if
your
honors
will
recall
it,
but
i
do
very
well
that
the
evidence
was
from
other
states
in
the
union.
there
was
nothing
said
about
anything
in
virginia.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
legal
counsel
in
virginia.
the
legal
counsel
involved
was
situated
in
baltimore.
since
that
time,
there
has
been
a
legal
counsel
appointed
in
virginia.
the
question
is
to
whether
the
assertion
of
legal
rights
is
chilled
in
virginia’s
--
or
i
would
suggest
that
in
any
event,
a
very
peculiar
one
and
only
may
be
a
virginia
lawyer
would
know
just
exactly
whether
there
was
any
chilling
or
not.
my
experience
is
that
in
virginia
showed
that
the
recognition
of
the
legal
rights
of
individuals
was
certainly
much
less
than
illinois,
and
at
many
times,
i
was
amazed
to
hear
the
constructions
of
ethical
cannons
that
were
promulgated
in
the
virginia
case.
all
in
all,
i
feel
that
this
case
through
many
hearings
and
arguments
has
gone
on
for
a
great
number
of
years.
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
proper
action
here
should
be
a
reversal
without
any
remandment
and
an
ending
of
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
without
remandment.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
the
second
dealing
by
this
court
with
the
legal
aid
or
legal
service
plan
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
the
petitioner
here
comes
under
the
different
name
of
the
united
transportation
union,
but
the
reason
for
that
is
solely
because
of
the
trainmen
has
been
merged
into
that
successor
union.
at
all
times
that
the
injunctions
were
issued
in
this
case,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
was
the
defendant
on
the
appeal
to
the
michigan
supreme
court,
the
merger
into
the
surviving
union
were
quashed.
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
are
whether
the
injunction
issued
deprives
the
union
members
of
rights
arguably
guaranteed
by
this
court
in
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
or
whether
those
injunctive
probations
are
contrary
to
the
this
court’s
subsequent
opinion
in
mine
workers
versus
illinois
state
bar
association.
alternatively,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
proceedings
after
remand
on
the
first
appeal
by
michigan
supreme
court
were
such
as
to
deprive
the
union
of
its
constitutional
right
the
procedure
of
due
process.
this
case
begun
with
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
1959,
and
basically
that
complaint
paraphrases
some
of
the
language
and
the
holdings
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
opinion
of
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
in
fact,
one
of
the
defenses
of
the
brotherhood
to
the
complaint
was
at
the
case
was
moot
because
of
the
fact
that
it
had
complied
with
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
in
that
defense,
the
brotherhood
alleged
that
the
state
bar
of
michigan
had
presented
evidence
before
the
illinois
supreme
court.
that
allegation
was
not
denied
in
the
reply
and
indeed
during
the
trial
in
1961,
the
counsel
for
the
state
bar
at
appendix
39
and
40
stated
that
its
evidence
and
its
charges
were
presented
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
and
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
there
should
be
no
further
proceeding
on
those
charges.
nevertheless,
before
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
by
its
terms
became
effective,
which
was
to
be
on
july
1,
1959,
the
state
bar
filed
this
complaint.
basically,
the
state
bar
claimed
that
the
brotherhood
had
a
plan
of
recommending
and
urging
that
its
members
seek
legal
advice,
and
not
only
seek
legal
advice
but
retraining
of
the
union
counsel.
the
union
admitted
such
in
its
answer.
the
state
bar
alleged
that
a
majority
of
such
federal
employers’
liability
act
cases
went
to
the
union
counsel.
the
union
denied
that
allegation,
but
did
admit
that
in
some
cases
but
not
in
all
and
they
went
to
such
counsel.
the
possibility
of
a
consent
decree
proving
fruitless,
the
case
went
to
trial.
and
at
trial,
the
counsel
for
the
state
bars
said
the
only
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
or
not
large
numbers
of
cases
went
to
the
legal
counsel
of
the
union.
so,
he
proceeded
to
prove
through
only
one
witness,
a
man
by
the
name
of
walsh
who
was
employed
by
the
association
of
american
railroads
claims
research
bureau,
and
who
in
such
employment
received
reports
from
other
railroads
as
to
how
many
cases,
the
appellee
cases,
were
handled
by
various
attorneys
where
the
residents
were
michigan
residents.
the
witness
also
testified
in
appendix
102
that
since
1953,
the
association
of
american
railroads
had
been
the
chief
investigating
agency
for
the
state
bar
and
had
been
in
the
michigan
state
seeking
evidence.
after
the
hearing,
briefs
were
filed
and
the
1962
virginia
decree
was
handed
down
by
the
chancellor
of
the
--
of
its
chancery
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
after
the
briefs,
there
was
a
1962
injunction
decree
issued
in
this
case.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
the
brotherhood
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
this
court
handed
down
its
opinion
in
1964
brotherhood.
the
michigan
supreme
court
after
being
informed
of
the
opinion
of
this
court,
reversed
and
remanded,
and
specifically
stated
that
permission
for
the
amendment
of
the
plaintiff’s
bill
to
seek,
if
it
be
so
advised,
relief
not
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
opinion
in
1964
brotherhood.
the
next
action
of
the
trial
court
was
a
motion
for
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
a
1965
injunction
decree
of
the
city
court
of
richmond
and
that
motion
was
not
acted
upon.
in
1966,
the
virginia
supreme
court
entered
its
opinion
on
the
appeal
from
the
1965
decree
and
reversed
the
part
of
that
opinion
which
attempted
to
draw
a
line
between
solicitation,
and
between
recommendation
and
urging.
the
state
bar
of
virginia,
petition
for
a
certiorari
to
this
court
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
opposed
the
petition.
the
petition
was
denied.
in
1967,
this
court
handed
down
it
mine
worker’s
decision.
and
following
that
decision,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
handed
down
the
1968
decree
which
is
now
before
this
court.
in
handing
down
that
decree,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
stated
that
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
reading
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
brotherhood
was
sufficient
to
warrant
the
promulgating
of
the
decree
in
this
case.
as
to
the
mine
worker’s
decision
which
was
brought
to
its
attention,
it
said
that
it’s
irrelevant
that
the
mine
worker’s
decision
dealt
only
with
the
financial
connection.
there
was
then
a
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan,
and
that
is
that
judgment
immediately
below.
by
4
to
3
decision,
the
michigan
supreme
court
affirmed
the
judgment.
it
did
not
look
at
the
injunctive
provisions.
instead,
it
proceeded
upon
a
analysis
of
this
court’s
1964
brotherhood
opinion
as
it
was
stated
by
the
virginia
supreme
court.
accepting
that
analysis,
it
stated
that
it
would
defend
its
understanding
of
the
tenants
of
equal
justice
under
law
if
the
brotherhood
were
to
receive
more
relief
in
michigan
then
it
had
already
obtained
in
virginia.
indeed,
it
said
that
absence
a
specific
order
from
washington
it
would
not
enter
such
an
order
or
a
judgment.
the
dissent
agreed
with
the
contention
of
petitioner
here.
it
stated
that
the
decree
could
not
be
entered
because
of
this
court’s
decision
in
1964
brotherhood,
and
said
even
if
that
were
not
so,
it
would
say
that
the
mine
workers’
case
was
sufficient
to
bar
the
entry
of
the
decree.
and
finally
under
michigan
law,
it
stated
that
the
proofs
was
stale,
the
pleadings
was
stale
and
that
there
was
no
clear
and
convincing
proof
of
any
violations,
and
therefore
under
michigan
law,
it
should
not
have
entered.
we
then
turn
to
the
first
question
of
this
case,
whether
or
not
that
this
decree
is
contrary
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
1964
brotherhood.
in
that
opinion
as
in
many
other
opinions
dealing
with
free
speech,
this
court
has
consistently
stated
a
rule
of
law
which
was
ignored
in
this
case.
the
burden
this
court
has
stated
and
very
clearly
and
very
directly
so
far
as
i’m
concern
is
upon
the
state
bar
to
prove
substantive
evils.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
proof
of
any
substantive
evil,
indeed,
there
was
no
updating
of
the
complaint
or
any
other
updating
of
the
proof.
the
proof
in
this
case
relates
at
the
very
latest
to
the
year
of
1960.
when
the
petitioner
here
requested
that
there
be
an
amending
of
the
complaint,
so
that
there
could
be
a
sharpening
of
the
issues,
that
request
was
ignored
despite
the
language
in
the
first
michigan
supreme
court
opinion
which
stated
that
permission
was
granted
for
leave
to
amend.
in
the
second
supreme
court
opinion
where
the
--
that
court
stated
in
the
majority
opinion
that
the
right
to
amend
was
an
alternative
and
that
the
state
bar
did
not
have
to
avail
itself
of
the
accorded
right
to
amend,
indeed,
it
didn’t
avail
itself
of
the
accorded
right
to
amend.
it’s
the
counsel
at
one
point
stated
that
he
did
not
choose
to
amend.
until
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
at
spoke,
it
was
unknown
to
this
petitioner
that
there
was
any
alternative
whatsoever.
assuming
that
there
was
such
an
alternative,
it
would
seem
that
this
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
turning
again
to
the
brotherhood
case,
that
case
held
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
united
states
report
that
this
case
did
not
involve
ambulance
chasing,
it
did
not
involve
unauthorized
practice,
it
did
not
involve
the
commercialization
of
the
legal
profession.
the
contention
of
the
respondent
and
of
the
court
below
seems
to
be
directly
contradictory
to
that
language
of
this
court.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
in
the
1964
brotherhood
opinion,
we
asserted
that
there
were
and
in
fact,
the
virginia
case
in
one
of
its
findings
held
that
all
of
the
cases
or
substantially
all
of
them
were
channeled
through
legal
counsel.
in
this
case,
the
allegation
was
the
majority,
but
the
proof
failed
to
prove
any
majority
and
the
finding
was
that
a
large
number.
and
in
fact,
the
finding
does
not
really
show
a
large
number.
at
page
168
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
summary
sheet
which
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
17
which
shows
a
summary
of
the
evidence
presented
through
the
association
of
american
railroads.
and
as
your
honor
will
note
the
bottom
line
deals
with
the
year
1960,
the
latest
year
and
shows
a
total
number
of
fela
cases.
34
of
those,
in
the
second
column,
only
6
were
handled
by
the
legal
counsel,
20
by
michigan
attorneys
and
8
by
other
attorneys.
the
only
substantial
amount
of
cases
shown
is
in
the
first
line
which
is
july
1,
1953
to
march
31,
1955.
there,
is
a
197
cases
of
which
a
126
supposedly
went
to
the
firm,
to
the
legal
counsel
firm,
but
when
the
data
on
which
that
summary
is
based
is
examined,
it's
seen
that
this
numbers
of
cases
does
not
deal
with
53,
but
instead
deals
with
the
great
number
of
years.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
plaintiff’s
exhibit
4
i
believe
it
is;
plaintiffs’
exhibit
3
shows
great
numbers
of
cases
which
were
undated.
and
then,
shows
for
the
legal
counsel
45
settlements,
46
settlements,
47
settlements,
and
48,
49,
50,
51,
52,
and
then
goes
into
the
53
settlements.
now
reason
for
that
was
that
in
1953,
the
association
of
american
railroads
formed
this
claims
research
bureau
which
went
out
to
obtain
evidence
against
various
counsel.
and
as
a
starter,
they
had
these
cards
signed
in
from
the
various
railroads
so
the
first
cards
that
came
in
dealt
with
many
another
years
outside
of
the
years
within
the
exhibit
of
53
through
55.
it’s
also
i
believe
note
worthy
that
primarily
those
earlier
years
are
shown
are
the
legal
counsel
cases.
any
cases
by
other
counsel
are
not
shown
by
year.
and
so,
it
creates
a
problem
is
to
whether
this
is
selected
evidence
or
not,
but
be
that
as
it
may
and
we
always
have
had
in
this
virginia
case
and
in
the
michigan
case,
questions
as
to
the
substantial
evidence
backing
any
of
the
injunctive
provisions.
the
fact
remains
that
the
state
bar's
own
exhibits
show
immediately
preceding
the
issuance
of
the
first
injunction,
a
very
minor
number
of
cases
handled
by
the
legal
counsel’s
firm.
i
don’t’
think
that
i
need
to
belabor
the
proposition
that
there
has
been
shifting
of
the
burden
here
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
by
the
court
below.
if
i
have
not
adequately
set
it
out
in
my
brief,
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
brief
for
the
amicus,
the
flcio
clearly
and
succinctly
shows
what
is
required
here.
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
particularly
note
page
7
of
the
that
brief
where
the
amicus
states
that
the
restrictions
on
group
legal
practice
plans
must
be
justified
by
proof,
tending
to
show
that
the
practice
which
is
enjoined
is
quote
“an
oppressive,
malicious
or
aberratious
use
of
the
legal
process
for
purely
private
gain,”
quoting
this
court’s
opinion
in
naacp
versus
button,
and
then
the
commercialization
language
from
the
trainmen
opinion.
i
think
that
being
the
standard
that
there
is
a
complete
failure
of
proof
in
this
case
whether
it’s
judged
as
of
1960,
or
as
of
1968
when
this
injunction
was
issued.
that
seems
also
to
me
that
the
mine
workers
decision
adds
a
further
reason
why
this
case
should
be
reversed.
in
mine
workers
as
this
court
were
recall
the
union
counsel
was
on
a
salary
and
all
of
the
cases
went
to
him
without
any
further
compensation.
indeed,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
fact
that
he
filled
out
an
injury
form
was
sufficient
to
cause
the
legal
counsel
to
begin
processing
the
workmen’s
compensation
claim
in
that
case.
that
case
also
was
completely
an
unauthorized
practice
of
law
case,
and
that
seems
to
be
the
principle
defense
of
the
state
bar
as
to
the
injunction
here
is
that
we
are
engaged
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law,
although,
there
was
no
such
allegation
in
the
only
complaint
file
below.
that
mine
workers
case,
i
think
is
also
particularly
relevant
on
the
first
injunctive
provision
about
which
we
complaint.
the
injunctive
provisions
are
set
out
at
appendix
176
and
177,
also
set
out
various
points
in
the
brief.
the
first
provision
enjoined
the
union
from
giving
or
furnishing
legal
advice.
now,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
for
reason
which
we
state
in
our
brief
at
pages
23
and
thereafter
that
this
is
not
part
of
the
brotherhood’s
plan.
the
brotherhood’s
plan
is
exactly
opposite.
it’s
not
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
the
union
is
not
practicing
law.
the
union
is
sending
the
cases
to
the
union
lawyer
and
saying
that
the
lawyer
practices
law.
this
is
the
practice
of
law.
it’s
a
new
definition
of
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
typically,
that
arises
when
the
corporation
itself
acts
through
lawyers
and
the
lawyers
are
merely
agents.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
retainer
contract
is
entered
the
too
between
the
injured
employee
and
the
lawyer,
and
then
that,
that
becomes
a
simple
handling
of
a
case
by
a
lawyer-client
relationship.
there’s
been
no
proof
either
in
virginia
or
here
that
anything
else
occurs.
the
second
provision
it
seems
to
me
also
is
such
that
it
would
strike
as
it
could
be
interpreted,
and
that’s
an
ambiguous
section
against
the
operation
of
this
plan.
that
prohibits
informing
any
lawyer
or
lawyers
that
an
accident
has
been
suffered
by
a
member
in
furnishing
the
name
and
address
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
legal
employment
for
any
lawyer.
and
this
i
think,
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
brotherhood’s
plan
at
it
reads.
as
virginia
interpreted,
it
seems
to
be
a
method
of
subverting
this
court’s
language
in
trainmen.
in
trainmen,
this
court's
stated
that
of
course,
counsel
had
the
same
right
to
accept
the
cases
that
the
union
had
in
channeling
the
cases.
virginia
recognized
that
language,
but
stated
that
it
did
not
interpreted
as
such
that
would
permit
the
lawyer
to
do
more
than
accept
and
rather
intend
it
to
bring
injunction
actions
or
disbarment
action
against
any
lawyer
who
did
anymore
than
accept,
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
stricken
down.
the
third
provision
deals
with
the
defraying
of
expenses;
that
is
from
stating
that
they
will
suggest
or
defray.
i
don’t
know
that
this
is
part
of
the
brotherhood
plan.
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
it
in
any
event
and
finally
under
illinois
law
which
is
the
state
which
the
legal
counsel
in
this
case
practices,
that’s
permitted
after
a
retainer
is
obtained.
the
fourth
provision
from
controlling
directly
or
indirectly
to
fees
charged,
it
seems
to
me
they
have
stricken
down
by
the
mine
workers
case
because
you
can
place
a
lawyer
on
a
salary
and
not
be
guilty
of
any
violations.
constitutionally,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
have
the
right
to
do
less
than
that,
and
that
is
to
do
what
the
union
used
to
do
in
this
case
to
limit
the
counsel’s
fee
to
25%.
the
fifth
injunctive
provision
is
a
rather
peculiar
one.
it
prohibits
accepting
or
receiving
compensation
of
any
kind
directly
or
indirectly
for
the
solicitation
of
legal
employment
for
any
lawyer.
now,
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
that
there
could
be
no
decree
which
prohibit
solicitation.
but
yet,
it
let
this
provision
stand
which
does
not
prohibits
solicitation,
but
prohibits
solicitation
plus
the
receiving
of
compensation
as
i
read
it,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
this
and
it
would
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
most
peculiar
ambiguous
section
that
should
be
stricken
down.
the
remainders
of
these
provisions
are
such
that
they
deal
with
financial
connections
of
the
some
sort.
i
would
like
to
particularly
note
that
the
last
one
from
sharing
in
any
recovery
for
personal
injury
or
death
by
gift
assignment
or
otherwise
is
brand
new
one.
it
was
not
in
the
1962
virginia
decree.
it
was
added
in
1965
by
the
chancellor
for
some
reason
because
in
that
case,
there
was
no
additional
evidence
taken
either.
now,
turning
to
the
question
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
we
have
to
generally
deal
with
the
michigan
statute
which
i
suppose
is
that
basis
on
which
this
injunction
is
issued.
it’s
the
--
the
only
thing
in
the
complaint
under
which
they
justify
the
issuance
of
the
1961
injunction,
on
page
32,
we
set
out
the
interpretation
of
that
statute
by
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
in
hightower
versus
detroit
edison
company,
which
the
court
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
discourage
the
practice
commonly
known
as
ambulance
chasing.
and
then
stated
that
there
were
four
separate
indications
of
it,
full
meaning
litigation,
subornation
of
perjury,
molting
of
innocent
persons
by
judgment
upon
manufactured
causes
of
action
or
defrauding
of
injured
persons,
having
proper
causes
of
action,
but
ignoring
their
legal
rights
by
means
of
contracts
which
retain
exorbitant
percentages
of
recovery.
now
in
this
case,
the
percentage
of
recovery
in
the
illinois
case
was
the
25%
than
prevalent
in
the
brotherhood
counsel.
and
that
was
stricken
down
by
the
illinois
court
because
it
was
undercutting
of
fees
rather
than
charging
of
exorbitant
fees.
so,
it
seemed
to
me
under
the
michigan
supreme
court's
reading
of
that
statute,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
there
was
any
violation
of
the
statute.
but
even
assuming
that
the
michigan
statute
can
be
read
to
cover
the
facts
in
this
case
which
strongly
submit
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
naacp
versus
button
with
dealing
with
a
similar
statute
would
require
it
striking
down.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
not
that
i
know
off,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no.
not
such
as
you
have
in
new
york.
the
remainder
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
devote
to
the
problem
which
it
seems
is
raised
in
this
case
by
the
reaction
of
the
courts
after
remand.
that
problem
is
the
problem
of
whether
the
union
after
remand
received
procedural
due
process.
after
remand,
if
the
brotherhood
wished
an
updating
of
the
complaint,
an
updating
of
the
proof.
indeed,
it
wished
an
opportunity
to
present
some
evidence
because
as
the
record
shows,
in
the
1961
hearing,
after
the
close
of
the
state
bar’s
evidence,
the
brotherhood
rested
without
presenting
any
evidence
upon
the
ground
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
showing
of
any
reason
for
an
injunction.
so,
we
are
now
faced
with
this
injunction
which
was
taken
from
virginia
and
as
to
that
injunction,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence.
there
is
no
contemporaneous
pleading.
there
are
no
allegations
of
the
provisions
in
the
injunction.
and
surprisingly
when
they
copied
the
virginia
injunction,
they
did
not
copy
the
findings
of
facts,
so
if
you
have
an
injunction
without
any
findings
of
fact.
the
findings
of
facts
that
now
remain
in
virginia
are
the
finding
of
facts
that
were
made
in
the
1962,
the
decree.
the
court
there
took
the
position
of
this
court’s
judgment
did
not
affect
the
findings
of
fact.
so
therefore,
you
have
the
problem
there
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
directly
contradictory
of
many
of
this
court’s
holdings.
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
1961
michigan
decree
do
not
apply
to
these
particular
injunctive
provisions.
on
this
procedural
due
process
point,
we
would
submit
that
the
ruffalo
case
by
this
court
requiring
a
fair
notice
of
reach
of
the
procedure
and
also
the
precise
nature
of
the
charges
is
directly
irrelevant.
we
would
also
submit
that
the
wilmer
case
by
this
court
requiring
a
hearing
so
that
there
could
be
a
rebuttal
of
any
charges
is
directly
irrelevant,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
general
injunctive
law
is
status
stated
in
our
brief
is
directly
relevant
here
and
as
accordance
with
the
conditional
standards
which
this
court
has
promulgated
in
the
brotherhood
and
in
mine
workers.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
correct
also,
your
honor.
my
reasons
for
that
were
that
i
thought
both
of
them
were
really
not
right
for
decision
by
this
court
at
first
because
i
didn’t
believe
it
was
a
final
judgment,
although
i
was
told
there
it
was.
and
then
the
second
time,
it
was
a
technical
since
the
court
below
claimed
that
it
was
not
appealable
under
virginia
law.
in
any
event,
the
virginia
supreme
court
interpretation
of
this
court’s
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
it’s
interpretation
and
i
would
not
presume
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
it’s
at
all
definitive
reminding
on
it.
the
courts
below
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
that
that
court’s
opinion
and
your
opinion
is
the
last
word,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
would
like
to
mention
that
in
regard
to
the
rehearing
in
virginia
when
we
came
back
down,
there
was
a
new
chancellor,
and
the
chancellor
who
heard
the
first
virginia
case
in
1962
and
issued
that
decree
had
retired
and
the
1965
decree
and
the
1967
decree
were
entered
by
a
chancellor
who
did
not
hear
the
evidence.
the
question
as
to
the
new
code
of
professional
responsibility,
i
think
is
pertinent
here.
i
don’t
feel
i’ll
go
quite
as
far
as
my
position
was
represented
by
the
state
bar,
that
new
cannon
says
that
it’s
a
lawyer’s
duty
to
see
that
legal
business
is
widely
disseminated
and
the
actual
language
is
that
a
lawyer
should
assist
the
legal
profession
fulfilling
its
duty
to
make
legal
counsel
available.
however,
it
does
have
a
caveat
in
it
that
legal
services
claims
while
you
can
tell
the
people
that
they
have
lawsuits,
you
must
not
take
the
case
unless
you’re
constitutionally
protected.
it
has
been
criticized
and
saying
that
the
bar
associations
are
willing
to
recognize
their
perspective
client’s
constitutional
rights,
but
no
other
rights.
i
think
that
for
that
reason,
this
court
should
be
clear
in
delineating
what
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
brother
here
and
of
other
legal
service
group
says
in
this
case.
the
question
as
to
no
chilling
in
virginia,
i
don’t
--
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record,
of
course,
as
to
whether
there’s
any
chilling
in
virginia
or
not,
the
virginia
case
in
1962
was
not
based
on
any
evidence
as
to
virginia.
i
don’t
know
if
your
honors
will
recall
it,
but
i
do
very
well
that
the
evidence
was
from
other
states
in
the
union.
there
was
nothing
said
about
anything
in
virginia.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
legal
counsel
in
virginia.
the
legal
counsel
involved
was
situated
in
baltimore.
since
that
time,
there
has
been
a
legal
counsel
appointed
in
virginia.
the
question
is
to
whether
the
assertion
of
legal
rights
is
chilled
in
virginia’s
--
or
i
would
suggest
that
in
any
event,
a
very
peculiar
one
and
only
may
be
a
virginia
lawyer
would
know
just
exactly
whether
there
was
any
chilling
or
not.
my
experience
is
that
in
virginia
showed
that
the
recognition
of
the
legal
rights
of
individuals
was
certainly
much
less
than
illinois,
and
at
many
times,
i
was
amazed
to
hear
the
constructions
of
ethical
cannons
that
were
promulgated
in
the
virginia
case.
all
in
all,
i
feel
that
this
case
through
many
hearings
and
arguments
has
gone
on
for
a
great
number
of
years.
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
proper
action
here
should
be
a
reversal
without
any
remandment
and
an
ending
of
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
without
remandment.
thank
you.
