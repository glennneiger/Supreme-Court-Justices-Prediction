unknown
speaker
we'll
do
our
best.
unknown
speaker
mr.
reed,
what
is
the
significance
of
what
you
have
just
said?
unknown
speaker
the
other
shipping
companies
are
not
directly
involved
with
this?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
review
board.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
name
of
this
company,
transatlantic
company?
unknown
speaker
were
they
in
any
different
positions
as
far
as
the
regular
proceedings
are
concerned
with
the
other
shipping
companies?
unknown
speaker
now
that's
about
what
judge
wyzanski
said,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
he
also
said
that
he
agreed
with
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
that
under
the
railroad
--
the
railroad
situation
the
shipper
sues
her
money
as
reparation
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
and
claims
are
raised
on
this.
there's
a
representative
of
the
committee
to
the
committee
on
the
reasonableness.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
commission
finds
the
way
reasonable,
there
is
review
provided
that's
provided
in
the
court
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
specific
statute
followed
a
decision
of
this
court
in
the
railroad
situation
in
doing
precisely
what
you
asked
us
to
deal
with
the
maritime.
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
this
court
decided
precisely
what
you
asked
us
to
do
here.
unknown
speaker
and
congress
prompted
the
contrary
rule
as
to
where
review
should
be
in
a
referred
manner.
unknown
speaker
in
a
reparate
manner.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you,
but
that
is
the
case
we
have.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
that
hardly
is
responsive
to
my
question
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
in
effect
reversed
the
pennsylvania
case.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
if
the
board
was
more
on
economic
employment
of
judicial
resources
that
have
reviewed
the
referring
court.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
the
atlantic
coast
line
appears
no
involvement
here
at
all
because
there,
the
court
dealt
with
the
situation
where
the
reparation
proceeding
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
itself
and
there
was
no
specific
statute
for
review
of
the
decision
of
the
commission
that
the
rate
was
unreasonable.
other
than
the
provision
that
that
order
would
be
reviewed
in
the
three-judge
court,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
this
court
decided
not
because
there
was
any
specific
statute
that
anywhere,
but
on
the
various
grounds
that
review
was
confined
to
the
shipper's
enforcement
action
in
another
district
court.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
are
agreeing
to
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
case
no
one
said
for
example
that
the
carrier
could
not
seek
review
in
some
other
court
that
the
shipper
did
not
file
his
own
action?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you?
let's
assume
a
shipper
asked
for
reparations
in
the
--
before
the
maritime
commission
and
it
gets
it.
and
the
maritime
commission
says
that
the
rate
is
unreasonable.
may
the
carrier
then
resort
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
you
say
is
the
exclusive
way
of
reviewing
such
an
order
of
the
maritime
commission?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
you
see
consolo
did
not
have
anything
like
1336
to
rely
on.
unknown
speaker
all
it
had
in
consolo
was
the
statute
which
says
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
in
all
of
the
maritime
commission,
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
concede
that
in
the
reparation
situation
the
carrier
would
have
to
seek
review
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
before
the
shipper's
enforcement.
unknown
speaker
not
if
there's
a
--
i
don't
think
you're
correct
mr.
friedman.
i
would
say
that
if
there
is
a
cease
and
desist
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
take
the
cease
and
desist
situation
there
and
the
carrier
and
the
shipper
seeks
to
enforce
its
reparation
order
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
where
may
the
carrier
seek
review
of
the
cease
and
desist
order?
unknown
speaker
he
has
to.
unknown
speaker
not
in
the
court
of
appeals?
even
though
the
statute
says
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals?]
unknown
speaker
congress
did
at
one
point
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
deals
--
it
deals
with
the
maritime
commission
orders
are
to
be
dealt
with
in
view
of
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
except
to
the
extent
of
the
administration
procedure
aren't
changeable?
unknown
speaker
in
any
case,
why
was
not
transatlantic
made
an
original
defendant?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
have
this
agent
--
unknown
speaker
that
last
condition
of
yours
except
that
mainly
transatlantic
were
parties,
that's
the
end
of
this
case,
right
--
unknown
speaker
you
don't
get
into
the
jurisdictional
question?
you
don't
get
into
the
volkswagenwerk?
unknown
speaker
res

or

[voice

unknown
speaker
i
did
not
read
the
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
judge
aldridge
as
i
read
his
opinion
made
no
findings
of
any
kind
as
to
sort
of
the
predicate
in
his
statement
that
“transatlantic
was
not
bound
by
earlier
proceedings.”
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
does
the
party
adjusting
to
the
maritime
commission
decision
seek
review
of
it
in
the
district
court
when
this
case
started?
unknown
speaker
they
were
untimely.
unknown
speaker
if
they
should
have
been
in
the
district
of
massachusetts,
they
never
did
go
there
even
with
the
petitioner's
review?
unknown
speaker
did
they
finally
oppose
that
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
it
never
--
it
never
sought
review
in
the
district
court
at
which
they

they
never
sought
to
review
in
that
court
because
the

speaker
even
if
the
court
of
appeals

and
that
it
happened
in
the
district
but
it
never
went
down.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
your

from
whether
you
are

or
not
you'd
still
be

mr.

what
is
the
