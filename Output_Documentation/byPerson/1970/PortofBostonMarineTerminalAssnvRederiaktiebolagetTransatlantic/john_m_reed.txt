mr.
john
m.
reed
thank
you,
your
honor.
on
behalf
of
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association
and
the
other
petitioners
who
are
the
port
terminals
of
the
city
of
boston,
i
am
going
to
divide
my
argument
in
three
sections.
i
will
state
the
case,
i
will
then
deal
as
briefly
as
i
can
with
the
problem
of
the
administrative
res
judicata
which
is
the
first
point
raised
on
the
petitioner
for
certiorari
and
i
will
conclude
with
the
problem
of
whether
the
issuance
of
the
tariff
in
issue
here
was
a
modification
of
the
conference
agreement
of
my
client,
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association.
this
case
if
the
court
please
began
in
the
summer
of
1965
when
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association
and
the
member
terminals
of
the
port
of
boston
brought
a
petition
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
superior
court
for
suffolk
county
in
massachusetts.
that
case
was
removed
by
the
respondents
where
the
boston
shipping
association
and
its
members
also
joined
these
respondents
in
the
original
case
to
the
federal
district
courts
setting
in
boston.
and
i
should
point
out
who
those
respondents
were.
they
were
the
shipping
association
itself,
an
organization
which
engages
in
labor
negotiation
for
the
steamships
in
boston
with
the
ila
locals.
the
members
were
the
steamship
carriers
in
some
cases,
in
some
cases
steamship
agents
whose
function
that
is
in
ports
to
negotiate
on
behalf
of
vessels
for
work
space
and
ancillary
needs
of
the
vessel.
the
case
was
removed
on
september
1,
1965
to
the
federal
district
court
in
boston
and
in
march
of
the
following
year,
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association
and
the
other
petitioners
laid
their
motion
for
a
pretrial
order
or
something
like
a
summary
judgment
which
would
have
given
the
respondents
an
opportunity
to
apply
to
the
federal
maritime
commission
to
show
the
invalidity
of
the
tariff
charge
being
made.
it
had
already
taken
place
in
this
case
as
i
will
come
to
that
there
had
been
discussions
to
try
to
press
the
boston
shipping
association
and
its
members
into
filing
a
complaint
with
the
fmc
which
was
the
only
place
where
the
validity
of
this
tariffs
could
be
adjudged
in
the
opinion
of
the
petitioners.
nothing
had
been
done
up
until
that
point
but
the
federal
district
judge
hearing
this
most
in
the
spring
of
1966
entered
an
order,
that
the
case
should
be
stayed
until
the
defendants
did
have
an
opportunity
to
make
their
complaint
under
section
21
of
the
shipping
act
with
the
federal
maritime
commission.
and
that
order
appears
two
places
in
the
record
here,
and
in
one
place
it
set
out
in
full
in
rather
formal
language.
and
the
other
places,
in
the
docket
entries
that
will
appear
in
the
record
appendix,
the
language
of
the
order
may
become
important
and
what
follows
and
the
order
was
not
really
a
reference
to
the
federal
maritime
commission.
the
order
rather
was
one
which
gave
the
declaration
that
the
fmc
had
initial
and
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
charges
in
question
and
that
the
--
within
proceeding
was
stayed
until
the
parties
involved
then
where
the
defendants
have
made
that
application.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
like
a
court
referring
a
case
to
a
master
or
the
fmc
referring
a
case
to
an
examiner.
the
proceeding
which
was
contemplated
would
be
a
collateral
proceeding
one
not
--
finally
not
of
the
court
proceeding
but
one
on
its
own
legs
and
in
fact,
that
is
what
actually
occurred.
on
april
21
--
mr.
john
m.
reed
the
significance
of
that
if
your
honor
please
is
that
we
will
have
argument
later
i
believe,
that
the
district
court
which
referred
the
matter
should
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
propriety
of
what
the
federal
maritime
commission
did
and
that
has
a
lot
of
appeal
if
i
may
say
so.
a
court
that
refers
any
kind
of
a
jurisprudential
question
to
an
agency,
a
master,
or
anybody
else
ought
to
have
the
power
to
determine
whether
that
person
to
whom
it
has
made
the
reference
has
done
it
right.
and
in
this
case,
and
indeed
in
all
such
cases
where
we
talked
about
reference,
we
are
really
using
an
illusion
there
wasn't
really
a
reference
in
this
case.
what
took
place
was
there
was
an
opportunity
to
make
the
application
and
the
proceeding
in
the
fmc
was
really
separate
from
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
case
went
to
the
federal
maritime
commission
under
a
complaint
that
was
filed
there
by
all
the
defendants
that
were
then
before
the
federal
district
court
that
included
all
the
members
of
the
boston
shipping
association.
i
think
that
stipulated
and
it
appears
several
places
in
the
record.
the
federal
maritime
commission
then
investigated
the
matter
with
a
trial
examiner.
and
the
trial
examiner
made
a
ruling
on
the
three
issues
that
have
been
raised
by
complaint
in
the
fmc,
one
each
under
the
sections
of
the
shipping
act
that
are
involved,
sections
15,
16
and
17
of
the
act.
the
examiner
had
made
an
adverse
determination
to
the
terminals
under
sections
16
and
17
issues.
those
are
really
reasonable
on
these
issues.
under
section
15
issue,
the
examiner
decided
in
favor
of
the
terminals.
the
terminals
appeal
to
the
full
board
of
the
commission
and
obtained
a
partial
reversal.
the
commission
reaffirmed
what
the
examiner
had
said
about
section
15.
that's
the
question
whether
these
tariffs
have
to
be
approved
under
section
15
with
the
shipping
act
as
modifications.
the
commission
reaffirmed
that.
but
on
the
reasonableness
issues
under
section
16
and
17,
the
commission
held
first,
as
to
certain
cargo,
namely
cargo
on
which
free
time
had
not
expired
at
the
outset
of
a
longshoremen's
strike,
the
charges
were
valid.
and
as
to
certain
other
cargo
namely
cargo
which
was
on
demurrage
at
the
outset
of
the
longshoremen's
strike,
the
charges
were
not
valid.
i
will
come
back
briefly
to
the
factual
background
there
as
part
of
stating
this
case
but
i'm
now
going
through
the
procedural
aspects
even
though
i
am
dividing
up
a
little
here.
the
commission's
decision
ends
with
an
order
and
why
am
i
going
into
this?
what
difference
it
make?
how
that
order
ends?
because
my
brothers
are
going
to
say
this
order
is
in
the
final
order.
and
i
say
it
is
a
final
order.
the
commission's
order
ends
with
the
conclusion
that
the
assessment
of
strikes
storage
against
the
vessel
for
cargo
on
which
free
time
has
expired
constitutes
an
unjust
and
unreasonable
practice
under
section
17
of
the
shipping
act
and
the
respondents
will
be
ordered
to
amend
there
strike
storage
rule
accordingly.
and
then
the
final
statement
in
the
order
is
the
respondents
herein,
that
were
my
clients,
shall
amend
their
terminal
tariff
number
one,
in
a
manner
not
inconsistent
with
the
commission's
decision
herein.
it's
going
to
be
said
and
i
post
on
this
that
this
was
not
a
final
order.
the
parties
regarded
as
the
final
order
at
that
time.
it
certainly
ordered
the
terminals
to
do
something
and
it
wasn't
just
a
re-affirmance
of
everything
that
the
terminals
have
been
doing
up
to
date.
and
in
fact,
the
boston
shipping
association,
my
appellants
and
their
members
applied
to
the
federal
district
court
in
boston.
on
july
27,
1967
after
this
decision
which
came
out
in
june
23,
1967
applied
to
the
district
court
in
boston
for
an
amendment
of
the
original
order
that
the
court
had
granted
on
the
question
of
primary
jurisdiction.
and
that
amendment
was
one
which
the
court
allowed
by
the
way
was
one
which
would
recognize
all
normal
rights
of
appeal
from
agency
decisions
that
haven't
been
clear
on
the
original
order.
it
was
the
boston
shipping
association
that
asked
that
to
be
amended.
unfortunately,
when
the
boston
shipping
association
got
filing
its
petition
for
review
with
its
member
terminals
it
was
late,
and
all
of
the
cases
fully
briefed
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
with
the
record
and
some
of
the
transcript
that
were
available
before
the
commission
when
it
got
there,
it
was
late
and
the
court
dismissed
the
case.
so
that
determined
any
of
the
merits
and
that
order
of
the
dc
court
of
appeals
is
printed
in
the
record
appendix
of
our
brief
on
pages
66
and
following.
it
was
about
that
time
that
this
court
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
this
court
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case
on
march
8
through
thereabouts.
at
1968,
in
the
dc
court
of
appeals
was
about
to
throw
the
boston
shipping
association
out
on
march
18th.
sometime
after
that,
the
swedish
transatlantic
line
whom
mr.
galland
represents
on
my
left
filed
the
petition
with
the
federal
maritime
commission
for
reconsideration
on
the
ground
of
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
in
that
petition
which
i
filed
a
reply
brief
to
was
sent
back
to
the
counsel
for
swedish
transatlantic
without
action
by
the
commission
is
being
time
barred.
the
case
before
the
federal
district
court
in
boston
still
with
pending
and
the
swedish
transatlantic
line
represented
by
mr.
galland
then
petitioned
to
intervene
in
the
boston
case.
things
were
coming
out
for
trial
before
the
federal
district
court
in
boston
and
chief
judge
wyzanski
allowed
their
petition
for
intervention.
in
which
they
said
in
pages
26
and
27
of
our
record
appendix
that,
at
all
times
relevant
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
case
transatlantic
was
represented
in
the
port
of
boston
by
its
agent
furness,
withy
and
company.
and
in
which
they
also
said
on
page
27
of
our
record
appendix,
on
september
4,
1968
transatlantic
which
at
all
times
prior
thereto
had
been
represented
by
counsel
for
furness,
withy
petitioned
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
its
own
name
of
the
point
being
that
they
regarded
themselves
as
having
been
in
the
case
up
until
that
point
but
the
trouble
was
that
they
were
dissatisfied
and
one
can
understand
it
with
the
posture
of
the
situation
as
it
then
start
before
the
federal
district
court
in
boston.
the
federal
district
court
heard
the
parties
on
a
stipulation
of
all
the
facts
including
the
federal
maritime
commission's
decision
and
made
a
two-point
decision.
first,
he
said
that
it
would
be
incumbent
on
the
object
or
transatlantic
to
intervene
in
the
fmc
proceedings
and
claim
normal
rights
of
appeal
if
it
wanted
to
get
into
these
issues
which
were
presented.
and
second,
even
if
this
court
were
to
review
it,
meaning
the
federal
district
court,
we
would
reach
the
same
result
that
the
federal
maritime
commission
did
and
for
reasons
that
are
amply
set
forth
in
the
commission's
decision
itself
and
therefore,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
of
judgment
against
all
of
the
defendants
including
transatlantic.
transatlantic
only
appealed
--
transatlantic
appealed
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
want
a
reversal.
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
first
on
the
res
judicata
issue,
they
want
a
party
and
as
a
party
they
went
bound
by
the
fmc's
decision.
and
second,
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
volkswagenwerk
case
took
an
expanded
reading
of
section
15
and
under
that
expanded
reading,
a
number
of
cases
seems
to
be
authoritative
which
are
collected
in
a
footnote
in
the
court's
opinion
on
page
51
of
the
record
appendix
and
these
charges
would
become
modifications
of
the
original
section
15
agreement.
now
that
was
the
procedure
in
the
case
and
the
factual
background
is
not
complex.
the
factual
background
is
this.
in
the
port
of
boston,
the
terminals
have
organized
under
a
terminal
conference
agreement
numbered
8785
and
that
terminal
conference
agreement
authorizes
the
members
to
issue
a
tariff
to
fix
charges
and
rates
on
wharfage,
demurrage,
and
other
terminal
services.
the
exact
language
of
the
agreement
is
printed
entirely
in
the
record
appendix.
the
following
subject
matters
and
all
services,
facilities
rates,
and
charges
incidental
thereto:
wharfage,
dockage,
free
time
wharf
demurrage,
usage
charges,
passenger
charges,
water
and
electricity.
it
was
under
that
agreement
that
the
members
issued
their
tariff
originally
in
1962
amending
it
in
1964.
the
amendment
of
the
tariff
changed
the
charge
for
wharf
demurrage
over
to
the
vessel
in
cases
of
longshoremen's
strikes.
when
as
a
practical
matter,
the
consignee
can't
get
his
cargo
off
the
pier.
that
was
a
practical
judgment
of
the
terminals
of
something
that
was
fair
to
do
and
they
ought
to
do.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
bill
collections
or
anything
like
that.
they
were
charging
people
for
wharf
storage
or
wharf
demurrage
on
cargo
where
the
man
physically
could
not
get
his
truck
in
to
pick
off
the
cargo.
and
so
they
transferred
it
under
the
tariff
to
the
vessel,
where
it
was
the
longshoremen's
strike
and
under
the
same
provision
in
the
tariff,
if
it's
a
terminal
employee's
strike
and
longshoremen
are
not
employees
of
the
terminals
but
if
it
is
a
terminal
employee's
strike
that
prevents
removal
then
there
is
no
charge
to
anybody.
that
was
the
practical
situation
that
led
up
to
this
thorny
administrative
law
of
question.
the
question
of
the
review
by
the
district
court
of
this
federal
maritime
commission
decision
is
one
that
can
be
easily
answered
from
examination
of
the
terms
of
the
statutes.
i
don't
see
how
the
administrative
order's
review
act
could
be
clearer
when
it
says,
“exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
orders
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
under
section
830
of
chapter
46
is
in
the
court
of
appeals.”
if
that's
what
it
says,
presumably
that's
what
it
means
and
i
realized
that
my
brother
has
made
a
talented
argument
to
call
icc
procedures
into
this
case
but
in
a
nutshell
the
argument
cannot
carry
the
cases
that
he
cites
in
particular
won't
support
him.
i
think
they're
contradictory
to
his
argument.
the
only
one
which
i
am
going
to
mention
before
passing
on
to
the
section
15
issue
is
pennsylvania
railroad
versus
the
united
states
in
363.
in
that
case,
the
reference
so
called
was
the
same
kind
of
reference
we
had
in
this
case.
in
that
case
the
court
of
claims
stayed
the
proceeding
before
it,
which
was
a
proceeding
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
against
the
united
states
stayed
it.
so
the
complaining
party
could
go
to
the
icc,
which
the
complaining
party
did
and
under
the
statutes
governing
that
particular
situation,
the
loser
before
the
icc
would
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
district
court
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
situation.
and
this
court
held
that
as
a
result,
the
court
of
claims
had
no
review
jurisdiction.
it's
a
holding
that
is
quite
parallel
to
our
situation
and
quite
opposite
to
what
my
brother
will
argue.
and
moreover,
the
court
pointed
out
there
that
where
the
icc
had
reached
the
divided
determination
on
the
issue
that
is
the
railroad
one
on
some
of
the
issue
and
the
u.s.
as
the
shipper,
one
on
some
of
the
issue,
would
that
happened
the
order
was
not
merely
advisory.
the
order
was
just
as
final
as
it
could
be
and
it
was
in
this
case.
it
was
nothing
more
that
could
be
done
after
these
commission
proceedings.
and
for
that
reason
we
say
it
would
appear
that
these
issues
although
it
have
been
litigated
before
the
commission
by
transatlantic,
if
it
wanted
to
get
in
at
that
time.
it
was
represented
in
the
commission
proceedings
and
there's
nothing
unfair
in
holding
on
to
that.
but
if
this
court,
now
this
is
the
third
and
last
part
of
my
argument,
does
decide
that
there
is
something
unfair
and
what's
taken
place
or
that
transatlantic
in
some
way
that
i
cannot
file
them
as
missed
today
in
court
when
it
was
represented
by
its
agent
furness,
withy
before
the
commission.
if
this
court
reaches
that
point
and
i
would
rather
hope
it
will
because
the
issue
here
on
the
merits
is
so
important,
then
the
argument
is
resolved
not
by
looking
at
the
first
instance
at
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
not
as
far
as
i,
as
counsel
i'm
concern
because
i
am
arguing
that
goes
with
route
of
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
you
can
tell
authoritatively
what
that
case
means.
but
i
look
first
to
the
statute
to
see
what
it
says.
it
says
that
all
agreements
or
modifications
of
agreements
between
persons
subject
to
the
act,
ocean
carriers
or
person
subject
to
the
act
shall
be
filed
with
and
approved
by
the
commission
where
they
allocate
fares
of
fixed
rates
etcetera,
etcetera.
8785,
the
original
conference
agreement
did
relate
to
the
fixing
of
rates.
it
was
filed
with
the
commission.
it
was
approved
by
the
commission.
there
is
not
a
word
anywhere
in
8785,
the
original
conference
agreement
that
says
who's
going
to
bear
the
brand
of
any
particular
charges.
there's
a
lot
of
other
things
that
it
doesn't
say.
all
it
sets
up
is
a
means
of
operation
by
conferences
which
has
become
extremely
common
in
the
ports
of
the
united
states
and
sets
up
a
means
of
publishing
tariffs.
it
sets
up
a
means
whereby
the
tariffs
are
published
with
a
certain
notice,
a
notice
of
30
days,
so
the
public
does
find
out
about
it.
the
public
can
come
in
and
complain
if
they
don't
like
it.
in
this
case
the
tariff
was
issued
the
first
time
september
--
sometime
or
in
the
middle
of
september
1964.
right
in
the
record,
there
is
a
letter
from
the
boston
shipping
association
or
wire,
dated
september
29,
1964.
that's
months
ahead
of
any
longshoremen's
strike,
saying
“we're
not
going
to
pay
it,
we
object
to
it.”
they
knew
all
about
it,
they
could
come
right
in
to
the
federal
maritime
commission
then
and
make
their
objection.
that
is
the
procedure
under
this
conference
agreements
it
is
quite
in
compliance
with
the
statute.
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
that
cause
an
issuance
of
the
tariff,
a
modification
of
the
agreement
that
provides
for
issuance
of
tariffs,
except,
now
here
if
the
court
meant
differently,
the
court
will
have
the
opportunity
to
correct
this
situation
but
the
volkswagenwerk
case
nowhere
says
that
the
issuance
of
a
tariff
under
an
approved
conference
agreement
constitutes
a
modification
of
the
conference
agreement.
the
volkswagenwerk
case
did
not
involve
the
conference
agreement.
it
involved
them
the
fund
arrangements
on
the
west
coast.
there
was
not
any
fmc
approved
agreement
or
whatsoever.
the
court
said
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
“sure,
if
it's
routine
don't
bother
to
present
it
to
the
commission
for
approval.”
but
this
isn't
routine.
this
involves
assessing
a
gigantic
fund,
millions
of
dollars
which
are
going
to
be
allocated
among
people
whether
they
like
it
or
not.
in
our
case,
in
complete
contrast,
there
is
a
conference
agreement,
it
provides
for
the
issuance
of
tariffs
and
the
footnotes
of
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
to
me,
it
indicates
that
this
court
was
aware
of
that
situation
that
is
that
conferences
did
operate
by
the
issuance
of
tariffs
without
obtaining
separate
approval
of
each
one.
mr.
john
m.
reed
all
of
the
shipping
companies
--
mr.
john
m.
reed
if
your
honor
please,
all
the
shipping
companies
of
boston,
at
least
indirectly
participated
in
the
proceedings
before
the
fmc.
that
includes
not
only
transatlantic
but
every
other
shipping
company
that
calls
that
at
our
board.
the
furness,
withy
and
company,
patterson,
wild
and
company,
norton,
lilly
and
company,
those
are
the
steamship
agents
named.
the
u.s.
lines
didn't
operate
through
a
steamship
agent.
so
they
didn't
have
a
steamship
agent
in
there.
every
one
of
those
steamship
agent
companies
represents
a
number
of
lines
that
call
at
boston.
so
that
at
least
indirectly
through
their
agents,
they
were
represented
then
and
mr.
glenn
who
tried
this
whole
matter
before
the
fmc,
represented
the
carrier
interests.
all
the
bills
of
lading
issued
by
these
carriers
went
into
evidence
at
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
includes
the
bill
of
lading
on
the
matter
longer
that
resulted
in
the
$8,000
demurrage
charge
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
reed
swedish
transatlantic
lines.
mr.
john
m.
reed
they
were
a
little
bit
different
from
the
u.s.
lines.
the
u.s.
lines
were
named
as
an
original
defendant
in
the
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
for
suffolk
county.
as
far
as
furness,
withy
was
involved
they
were
named
as
a
defendant.
this
$8,000
charge
which
is
presently
up
before
your
honors,
was
one
of
the
charges
that
is
annexed
to
the
bill
of
complaint
in
the
original
proceedings
that
furness,
withy
was
named
as
the
defendant.
i
also
want
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
a
definition
in
the
tariff,
it's
not
going
to
turn
this
case
one
way
or
the
other
but
the
tariff
consistently
with
the
practice
in
the
north
atlantic
ports
defines
the
vessel
as
including
the
agent.
it's
on
page
18,
volume
2
of
the
record.
the
term
vessel
refers
to
floating
craft
of
every
description
and
includes
the
owner
or
operator
or
such
other
persons
acting
as
agent
thereof.
and
the
practice
in
the
port
of
boston
is
to
regard
the
agent
as
identical
with
the
vessel.
for
those
reasons,
we
urged
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
affirm
the
direct
of
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
reed
if
your
honor
please,
question
arouse
us
to
the
reason
for
not
joining
the
transatlantic
in
the
district
court
and
this
very
court
proceedings.
someone
on
the
court
suggested
it
was
that
they
are
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
--
agents
under
the
tariff
are
liable
for
tariff
charges.
i
counted
up
in
the
petition,
five
of
the
respondents
were
carriers
and
the
other
eight
respondents
were
agents.
and
all
the
cases
agents,
all
the
bills
against
the
agents
were
bills
where
the
carrier
would
be
liable
over
and
indeed
as
mr.
galland
says
that
was
the
reason
that
transatlantic
came
into
this
case.
the
only
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
unbroken
line
of
decisions
about
wharf
demurrage
that
mr.
galland
refers
to
where
the
commission
has
steadily
held
demurrage
is
a
charge
against
cargo
interests
is
a
non-existent
line
of
authority
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
on
page
46
of
our
brief
we
cited
the
commission's
decision
as
quite
reason
doing
with
wharf
demurrage
where
the
vessel
has
canceled
or
been
delayed
and
so
that
the
charge
isn't
fairly
accessible
to
the
cargo
and
of
course,
it
is
not
their
fault.
in
that
situation
the
commission
says
the
demurrage
charge
ought
to
be
against
the
vessel.
that's
all
what
we're
asking
in
the
fmc
proceedings
here.
the
relief
we
asked
again
is
the
district
court's
decision
reaffirmed
and
the
circuit
courts
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
reed
thank
you,
your
honor.
on
behalf
of
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association
and
the
other
petitioners
who
are
the
port
terminals
of
the
city
of
boston,
i
am
going
to
divide
my
argument
in
three
sections.
i
will
state
the
case,
i
will
then
deal
as
briefly
as
i
can
with
the
problem
of
the
administrative
res
judicata
which
is
the
first
point
raised
on
the
petitioner
for
certiorari
and
i
will
conclude
with
the
problem
of
whether
the
issuance
of
the
tariff
in
issue
here
was
a
modification
of
the
conference
agreement
of
my
client,
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association.
this
case
if
the
court
please
began
in
the
summer
of
1965
when
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association
and
the
member
terminals
of
the
port
of
boston
brought
a
petition
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
superior
court
for
suffolk
county
in
massachusetts.
that
case
was
removed
by
the
respondents
where
the
boston
shipping
association
and
its
members
also
joined
these
respondents
in
the
original
case
to
the
federal
district
courts
setting
in
boston.
and
i
should
point
out
who
those
respondents
were.
they
were
the
shipping
association
itself,
an
organization
which
engages
in
labor
negotiation
for
the
steamships
in
boston
with
the
ila
locals.
the
members
were
the
steamship
carriers
in
some
cases,
in
some
cases
steamship
agents
whose
function
that
is
in
ports
to
negotiate
on
behalf
of
vessels
for
work
space
and
ancillary
needs
of
the
vessel.
the
case
was
removed
on
september
1,
1965
to
the
federal
district
court
in
boston
and
in
march
of
the
following
year,
the
port
of
boston
marine
terminal
association
and
the
other
petitioners
laid
their
motion
for
a
pretrial
order
or
something
like
a
summary
judgment
which
would
have
given
the
respondents
an
opportunity
to
apply
to
the
federal
maritime
commission
to
show
the
invalidity
of
the
tariff
charge
being
made.
it
had
already
taken
place
in
this
case
as
i
will
come
to
that
there
had
been
discussions
to
try
to
press
the
boston
shipping
association
and
its
members
into
filing
a
complaint
with
the
fmc
which
was
the
only
place
where
the
validity
of
this
tariffs
could
be
adjudged
in
the
opinion
of
the
petitioners.
nothing
had
been
done
up
until
that
point
but
the
federal
district
judge
hearing
this
most
in
the
spring
of
1966
entered
an
order,
that
the
case
should
be
stayed
until
the
defendants
did
have
an
opportunity
to
make
their
complaint
under
section
21
of
the
shipping
act
with
the
federal
maritime
commission.
and
that
order
appears
two
places
in
the
record
here,
and
in
one
place
it
set
out
in
full
in
rather
formal
language.
and
the
other
places,
in
the
docket
entries
that
will
appear
in
the
record
appendix,
the
language
of
the
order
may
become
important
and
what
follows
and
the
order
was
not
really
a
reference
to
the
federal
maritime
commission.
the
order
rather
was
one
which
gave
the
declaration
that
the
fmc
had
initial
and
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
charges
in
question
and
that
the
--
within
proceeding
was
stayed
until
the
parties
involved
then
where
the
defendants
have
made
that
application.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
like
a
court
referring
a
case
to
a
master
or
the
fmc
referring
a
case
to
an
examiner.
the
proceeding
which
was
contemplated
would
be
a
collateral
proceeding
one
not
--
finally
not
of
the
court
proceeding
but
one
on
its
own
legs
and
in
fact,
that
is
what
actually
occurred.
on
april
21
--
mr.
john
m.
reed
the
significance
of
that
if
your
honor
please
is
that
we
will
have
argument
later
i
believe,
that
the
district
court
which
referred
the
matter
should
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
propriety
of
what
the
federal
maritime
commission
did
and
that
has
a
lot
of
appeal
if
i
may
say
so.
a
court
that
refers
any
kind
of
a
jurisprudential
question
to
an
agency,
a
master,
or
anybody
else
ought
to
have
the
power
to
determine
whether
that
person
to
whom
it
has
made
the
reference
has
done
it
right.
and
in
this
case,
and
indeed
in
all
such
cases
where
we
talked
about
reference,
we
are
really
using
an
illusion
there
wasn't
really
a
reference
in
this
case.
what
took
place
was
there
was
an
opportunity
to
make
the
application
and
the
proceeding
in
the
fmc
was
really
separate
from
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
case
went
to
the
federal
maritime
commission
under
a
complaint
that
was
filed
there
by
all
the
defendants
that
were
then
before
the
federal
district
court
that
included
all
the
members
of
the
boston
shipping
association.
i
think
that
stipulated
and
it
appears
several
places
in
the
record.
the
federal
maritime
commission
then
investigated
the
matter
with
a
trial
examiner.
and
the
trial
examiner
made
a
ruling
on
the
three
issues
that
have
been
raised
by
complaint
in
the
fmc,
one
each
under
the
sections
of
the
shipping
act
that
are
involved,
sections
15,
16
and
17
of
the
act.
the
examiner
had
made
an
adverse
determination
to
the
terminals
under
sections
16
and
17
issues.
those
are
really
reasonable
on
these
issues.
under
section
15
issue,
the
examiner
decided
in
favor
of
the
terminals.
the
terminals
appeal
to
the
full
board
of
the
commission
and
obtained
a
partial
reversal.
the
commission
reaffirmed
what
the
examiner
had
said
about
section
15.
that's
the
question
whether
these
tariffs
have
to
be
approved
under
section
15
with
the
shipping
act
as
modifications.
the
commission
reaffirmed
that.
but
on
the
reasonableness
issues
under
section
16
and
17,
the
commission
held
first,
as
to
certain
cargo,
namely
cargo
on
which
free
time
had
not
expired
at
the
outset
of
a
longshoremen's
strike,
the
charges
were
valid.
and
as
to
certain
other
cargo
namely
cargo
which
was
on
demurrage
at
the
outset
of
the
longshoremen's
strike,
the
charges
were
not
valid.
i
will
come
back
briefly
to
the
factual
background
there
as
part
of
stating
this
case
but
i'm
now
going
through
the
procedural
aspects
even
though
i
am
dividing
up
a
little
here.
the
commission's
decision
ends
with
an
order
and
why
am
i
going
into
this?
what
difference
it
make?
how
that
order
ends?
because
my
brothers
are
going
to
say
this
order
is
in
the
final
order.
and
i
say
it
is
a
final
order.
the
commission's
order
ends
with
the
conclusion
that
the
assessment
of
strikes
storage
against
the
vessel
for
cargo
on
which
free
time
has
expired
constitutes
an
unjust
and
unreasonable
practice
under
section
17
of
the
shipping
act
and
the
respondents
will
be
ordered
to
amend
there
strike
storage
rule
accordingly.
and
then
the
final
statement
in
the
order
is
the
respondents
herein,
that
were
my
clients,
shall
amend
their
terminal
tariff
number
one,
in
a
manner
not
inconsistent
with
the
commission's
decision
herein.
it's
going
to
be
said
and
i
post
on
this
that
this
was
not
a
final
order.
the
parties
regarded
as
the
final
order
at
that
time.
it
certainly
ordered
the
terminals
to
do
something
and
it
wasn't
just
a
re-affirmance
of
everything
that
the
terminals
have
been
doing
up
to
date.
and
in
fact,
the
boston
shipping
association,
my
appellants
and
their
members
applied
to
the
federal
district
court
in
boston.
on
july
27,
1967
after
this
decision
which
came
out
in
june
23,
1967
applied
to
the
district
court
in
boston
for
an
amendment
of
the
original
order
that
the
court
had
granted
on
the
question
of
primary
jurisdiction.
and
that
amendment
was
one
which
the
court
allowed
by
the
way
was
one
which
would
recognize
all
normal
rights
of
appeal
from
agency
decisions
that
haven't
been
clear
on
the
original
order.
it
was
the
boston
shipping
association
that
asked
that
to
be
amended.
unfortunately,
when
the
boston
shipping
association
got
filing
its
petition
for
review
with
its
member
terminals
it
was
late,
and
all
of
the
cases
fully
briefed
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
with
the
record
and
some
of
the
transcript
that
were
available
before
the
commission
when
it
got
there,
it
was
late
and
the
court
dismissed
the
case.
so
that
determined
any
of
the
merits
and
that
order
of
the
dc
court
of
appeals
is
printed
in
the
record
appendix
of
our
brief
on
pages
66
and
following.
it
was
about
that
time
that
this
court
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
this
court
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case
on
march
8
through
thereabouts.
at
1968,
in
the
dc
court
of
appeals
was
about
to
throw
the
boston
shipping
association
out
on
march
18th.
sometime
after
that,
the
swedish
transatlantic
line
whom
mr.
galland
represents
on
my
left
filed
the
petition
with
the
federal
maritime
commission
for
reconsideration
on
the
ground
of
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
in
that
petition
which
i
filed
a
reply
brief
to
was
sent
back
to
the
counsel
for
swedish
transatlantic
without
action
by
the
commission
is
being
time
barred.
the
case
before
the
federal
district
court
in
boston
still
with
pending
and
the
swedish
transatlantic
line
represented
by
mr.
galland
then
petitioned
to
intervene
in
the
boston
case.
things
were
coming
out
for
trial
before
the
federal
district
court
in
boston
and
chief
judge
wyzanski
allowed
their
petition
for
intervention.
in
which
they
said
in
pages
26
and
27
of
our
record
appendix
that,
at
all
times
relevant
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
case
transatlantic
was
represented
in
the
port
of
boston
by
its
agent
furness,
withy
and
company.
and
in
which
they
also
said
on
page
27
of
our
record
appendix,
on
september
4,
1968
transatlantic
which
at
all
times
prior
thereto
had
been
represented
by
counsel
for
furness,
withy
petitioned
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
its
own
name
of
the
point
being
that
they
regarded
themselves
as
having
been
in
the
case
up
until
that
point
but
the
trouble
was
that
they
were
dissatisfied
and
one
can
understand
it
with
the
posture
of
the
situation
as
it
then
start
before
the
federal
district
court
in
boston.
the
federal
district
court
heard
the
parties
on
a
stipulation
of
all
the
facts
including
the
federal
maritime
commission's
decision
and
made
a
two-point
decision.
first,
he
said
that
it
would
be
incumbent
on
the
object
or
transatlantic
to
intervene
in
the
fmc
proceedings
and
claim
normal
rights
of
appeal
if
it
wanted
to
get
into
these
issues
which
were
presented.
and
second,
even
if
this
court
were
to
review
it,
meaning
the
federal
district
court,
we
would
reach
the
same
result
that
the
federal
maritime
commission
did
and
for
reasons
that
are
amply
set
forth
in
the
commission's
decision
itself
and
therefore,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
of
judgment
against
all
of
the
defendants
including
transatlantic.
transatlantic
only
appealed
--
transatlantic
appealed
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
want
a
reversal.
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
first
on
the
res
judicata
issue,
they
want
a
party
and
as
a
party
they
went
bound
by
the
fmc's
decision.
and
second,
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
volkswagenwerk
case
took
an
expanded
reading
of
section
15
and
under
that
expanded
reading,
a
number
of
cases
seems
to
be
authoritative
which
are
collected
in
a
footnote
in
the
court's
opinion
on
page
51
of
the
record
appendix
and
these
charges
would
become
modifications
of
the
original
section
15
agreement.
now
that
was
the
procedure
in
the
case
and
the
factual
background
is
not
complex.
the
factual
background
is
this.
in
the
port
of
boston,
the
terminals
have
organized
under
a
terminal
conference
agreement
numbered
8785
and
that
terminal
conference
agreement
authorizes
the
members
to
issue
a
tariff
to
fix
charges
and
rates
on
wharfage,
demurrage,
and
other
terminal
services.
the
exact
language
of
the
agreement
is
printed
entirely
in
the
record
appendix.
the
following
subject
matters
and
all
services,
facilities
rates,
and
charges
incidental
thereto:
wharfage,
dockage,
free
time
wharf
demurrage,
usage
charges,
passenger
charges,
water
and
electricity.
it
was
under
that
agreement
that
the
members
issued
their
tariff
originally
in
1962
amending
it
in
1964.
the
amendment
of
the
tariff
changed
the
charge
for
wharf
demurrage
over
to
the
vessel
in
cases
of
longshoremen's
strikes.
when
as
a
practical
matter,
the
consignee
can't
get
his
cargo
off
the
pier.
that
was
a
practical
judgment
of
the
terminals
of
something
that
was
fair
to
do
and
they
ought
to
do.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
bill
collections
or
anything
like
that.
they
were
charging
people
for
wharf
storage
or
wharf
demurrage
on
cargo
where
the
man
physically
could
not
get
his
truck
in
to
pick
off
the
cargo.
and
so
they
transferred
it
under
the
tariff
to
the
vessel,
where
it
was
the
longshoremen's
strike
and
under
the
same
provision
in
the
tariff,
if
it's
a
terminal
employee's
strike
and
longshoremen
are
not
employees
of
the
terminals
but
if
it
is
a
terminal
employee's
strike
that
prevents
removal
then
there
is
no
charge
to
anybody.
that
was
the
practical
situation
that
led
up
to
this
thorny
administrative
law
of
question.
the
question
of
the
review
by
the
district
court
of
this
federal
maritime
commission
decision
is
one
that
can
be
easily
answered
from
examination
of
the
terms
of
the
statutes.
i
don't
see
how
the
administrative
order's
review
act
could
be
clearer
when
it
says,
“exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
orders
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
under
section
830
of
chapter
46
is
in
the
court
of
appeals.”
if
that's
what
it
says,
presumably
that's
what
it
means
and
i
realized
that
my
brother
has
made
a
talented
argument
to
call
icc
procedures
into
this
case
but
in
a
nutshell
the
argument
cannot
carry
the
cases
that
he
cites
in
particular
won't
support
him.
i
think
they're
contradictory
to
his
argument.
the
only
one
which
i
am
going
to
mention
before
passing
on
to
the
section
15
issue
is
pennsylvania
railroad
versus
the
united
states
in
363.
in
that
case,
the
reference
so
called
was
the
same
kind
of
reference
we
had
in
this
case.
in
that
case
the
court
of
claims
stayed
the
proceeding
before
it,
which
was
a
proceeding
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
against
the
united
states
stayed
it.
so
the
complaining
party
could
go
to
the
icc,
which
the
complaining
party
did
and
under
the
statutes
governing
that
particular
situation,
the
loser
before
the
icc
would
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
district
court
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
situation.
and
this
court
held
that
as
a
result,
the
court
of
claims
had
no
review
jurisdiction.
it's
a
holding
that
is
quite
parallel
to
our
situation
and
quite
opposite
to
what
my
brother
will
argue.
and
moreover,
the
court
pointed
out
there
that
where
the
icc
had
reached
the
divided
determination
on
the
issue
that
is
the
railroad
one
on
some
of
the
issue
and
the
u.s.
as
the
shipper,
one
on
some
of
the
issue,
would
that
happened
the
order
was
not
merely
advisory.
the
order
was
just
as
final
as
it
could
be
and
it
was
in
this
case.
it
was
nothing
more
that
could
be
done
after
these
commission
proceedings.
and
for
that
reason
we
say
it
would
appear
that
these
issues
although
it
have
been
litigated
before
the
commission
by
transatlantic,
if
it
wanted
to
get
in
at
that
time.
it
was
represented
in
the
commission
proceedings
and
there's
nothing
unfair
in
holding
on
to
that.
but
if
this
court,
now
this
is
the
third
and
last
part
of
my
argument,
does
decide
that
there
is
something
unfair
and
what's
taken
place
or
that
transatlantic
in
some
way
that
i
cannot
file
them
as
missed
today
in
court
when
it
was
represented
by
its
agent
furness,
withy
before
the
commission.
if
this
court
reaches
that
point
and
i
would
rather
hope
it
will
because
the
issue
here
on
the
merits
is
so
important,
then
the
argument
is
resolved
not
by
looking
at
the
first
instance
at
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
not
as
far
as
i,
as
counsel
i'm
concern
because
i
am
arguing
that
goes
with
route
of
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
you
can
tell
authoritatively
what
that
case
means.
but
i
look
first
to
the
statute
to
see
what
it
says.
it
says
that
all
agreements
or
modifications
of
agreements
between
persons
subject
to
the
act,
ocean
carriers
or
person
subject
to
the
act
shall
be
filed
with
and
approved
by
the
commission
where
they
allocate
fares
of
fixed
rates
etcetera,
etcetera.
8785,
the
original
conference
agreement
did
relate
to
the
fixing
of
rates.
it
was
filed
with
the
commission.
it
was
approved
by
the
commission.
there
is
not
a
word
anywhere
in
8785,
the
original
conference
agreement
that
says
who's
going
to
bear
the
brand
of
any
particular
charges.
there's
a
lot
of
other
things
that
it
doesn't
say.
all
it
sets
up
is
a
means
of
operation
by
conferences
which
has
become
extremely
common
in
the
ports
of
the
united
states
and
sets
up
a
means
of
publishing
tariffs.
it
sets
up
a
means
whereby
the
tariffs
are
published
with
a
certain
notice,
a
notice
of
30
days,
so
the
public
does
find
out
about
it.
the
public
can
come
in
and
complain
if
they
don't
like
it.
in
this
case
the
tariff
was
issued
the
first
time
september
--
sometime
or
in
the
middle
of
september
1964.
right
in
the
record,
there
is
a
letter
from
the
boston
shipping
association
or
wire,
dated
september
29,
1964.
that's
months
ahead
of
any
longshoremen's
strike,
saying
“we're
not
going
to
pay
it,
we
object
to
it.”
they
knew
all
about
it,
they
could
come
right
in
to
the
federal
maritime
commission
then
and
make
their
objection.
that
is
the
procedure
under
this
conference
agreements
it
is
quite
in
compliance
with
the
statute.
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
that
cause
an
issuance
of
the
tariff,
a
modification
of
the
agreement
that
provides
for
issuance
of
tariffs,
except,
now
here
if
the
court
meant
differently,
the
court
will
have
the
opportunity
to
correct
this
situation
but
the
volkswagenwerk
case
nowhere
says
that
the
issuance
of
a
tariff
under
an
approved
conference
agreement
constitutes
a
modification
of
the
conference
agreement.
the
volkswagenwerk
case
did
not
involve
the
conference
agreement.
it
involved
them
the
fund
arrangements
on
the
west
coast.
there
was
not
any
fmc
approved
agreement
or
whatsoever.
the
court
said
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
“sure,
if
it's
routine
don't
bother
to
present
it
to
the
commission
for
approval.”
but
this
isn't
routine.
this
involves
assessing
a
gigantic
fund,
millions
of
dollars
which
are
going
to
be
allocated
among
people
whether
they
like
it
or
not.
in
our
case,
in
complete
contrast,
there
is
a
conference
agreement,
it
provides
for
the
issuance
of
tariffs
and
the
footnotes
of
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
to
me,
it
indicates
that
this
court
was
aware
of
that
situation
that
is
that
conferences
did
operate
by
the
issuance
of
tariffs
without
obtaining
separate
approval
of
each
one.
mr.
john
m.
reed
all
of
the
shipping
companies
--
mr.
john
m.
reed
if
your
honor
please,
all
the
shipping
companies
of
boston,
at
least
indirectly
participated
in
the
proceedings
before
the
fmc.
that
includes
not
only
transatlantic
but
every
other
shipping
company
that
calls
that
at
our
board.
the
furness,
withy
and
company,
patterson,
wild
and
company,
norton,
lilly
and
company,
those
are
the
steamship
agents
named.
the
u.s.
lines
didn't
operate
through
a
steamship
agent.
so
they
didn't
have
a
steamship
agent
in
there.
every
one
of
those
steamship
agent
companies
represents
a
number
of
lines
that
call
at
boston.
so
that
at
least
indirectly
through
their
agents,
they
were
represented
then
and
mr.
glenn
who
tried
this
whole
matter
before
the
fmc,
represented
the
carrier
interests.
all
the
bills
of
lading
issued
by
these
carriers
went
into
evidence
at
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
includes
the
bill
of
lading
on
the
matter
longer
that
resulted
in
the
$8,000
demurrage
charge
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
reed
swedish
transatlantic
lines.
mr.
john
m.
reed
they
were
a
little
bit
different
from
the
u.s.
lines.
the
u.s.
lines
were
named
as
an
original
defendant
in
the
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
for
suffolk
county.
as
far
as
furness,
withy
was
involved
they
were
named
as
a
defendant.
this
$8,000
charge
which
is
presently
up
before
your
honors,
was
one
of
the
charges
that
is
annexed
to
the
bill
of
complaint
in
the
original
proceedings
that
furness,
withy
was
named
as
the
defendant.
i
also
want
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
a
definition
in
the
tariff,
it's
not
going
to
turn
this
case
one
way
or
the
other
but
the
tariff
consistently
with
the
practice
in
the
north
atlantic
ports
defines
the
vessel
as
including
the
agent.
it's
on
page
18,
volume
2
of
the
record.
the
term
vessel
refers
to
floating
craft
of
every
description
and
includes
the
owner
or
operator
or
such
other
persons
acting
as
agent
thereof.
and
the
practice
in
the
port
of
boston
is
to
regard
the
agent
as
identical
with
the
vessel.
for
those
reasons,
we
urged
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
affirm
the
direct
of
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
reed
if
your
honor
please,
question
arouse
us
to
the
reason
for
not
joining
the
transatlantic
in
the
district
court
and
this
very
court
proceedings.
someone
on
the
court
suggested
it
was
that
they
are
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
--
agents
under
the
tariff
are
liable
for
tariff
charges.
i
counted
up
in
the
petition,
five
of
the
respondents
were
carriers
and
the
other
eight
respondents
were
agents.
and
all
the
cases
agents,
all
the
bills
against
the
agents
were
bills
where
the
carrier
would
be
liable
over
and
indeed
as
mr.
galland
says
that
was
the
reason
that
transatlantic
came
into
this
case.
the
only
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
unbroken
line
of
decisions
about
wharf
demurrage
that
mr.
galland
refers
to
where
the
commission
has
steadily
held
demurrage
is
a
charge
against
cargo
interests
is
a
non-existent
line
of
authority
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
on
page
46
of
our
brief
we
cited
the
commission's
decision
as
quite
reason
doing
with
wharf
demurrage
where
the
vessel
has
canceled
or
been
delayed
and
so
that
the
charge
isn't
fairly
accessible
to
the
cargo
and
of
course,
it
is
not
their
fault.
in
that
situation
the
commission
says
the
demurrage
charge
ought
to
be
against
the
vessel.
that's
all
what
we're
asking
in
the
fmc
proceedings
here.
the
relief
we
asked
again
is
the
district
court's
decision
reaffirmed
and
the
circuit
courts
reversed.
thank
you.
