mr.
george
f.
galland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
interrogation
has
--
from
the
bench
has
indicated
this
is
a
very
hard
case
to
compress
and
focus.
it
tends
to
break
itself
apart
into
one
uncommon
number
of
issues
for
a
case
of
itself.
i
tend
to
think
that
an
item
of
wisdom
dispensed
by
this
court
would
many
years
ago
in
the
southern
steamship
case.
it
offers
good
guidance
here.
the
southern
steamship
case
was
a
case
where
a
crew
of
a
steamship
can
not
make,
had
mutinied
in
a
foreign
port
and
were
fired.
when
they
got
home,
they
brought
a
proceeding
against
the
employer
charging
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
firing
because
they
had
mutinied
and
labor
board
said
that
was
right,
it
was
unfit.
this
court
have
said
determination
considered
as
sufficient
for
this
case
to
observe
that
the
board
has
not
been
commissioned
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
labor
relations
act
so
single-mindedly
that
it
may
wholly
ignore
other
and
equally
important
congressional
objectives.
frequently,
the
entire
scope
of
congressional
purpose
calls
for
careful
accommodation
of
one
statutory
scheme
to
another
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
demand
of
an
administrative
body
that
it
undertake
this
accommodation
without
excessive
emphasis
upon
its
immediate
task.
that
seems
to
me
that
to
determine
this
case
within
the
contracts
of
the
explicit
language
of
the
administrative
orders
review
act.
in
the
one
sentence
that
says
the
court
of
appeals
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
certain
final
orders
of
the
maritime
commission
is
to
perpetuate
a
list
of
additional
administrative
horrors
that
should
not
be
countenance
by
this
court
or
by
any
court
in
the
judicial
system,
if
there
is
any
rational
way
to
get
away
from
it.
this
case
started
out
with
a
lawsuit
in
boston
first
in
the
state
court
was
transferred
over
to
the
united
states
district
court
which
sought
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
something
called
the
tariff
which
had
been
filed
by
a
group
of
terminal
warehouses
with
the
federal
maritime
commission.
i
say
it
was
called
a
tariff
because
it
was
really
just
a
price
list
that
had
no
sanction
except
the
private
agreement
among
the
parties
that
had
been
approved
at
one
time
in
1962
by
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
which
had
the
provision
and
it
is
saying
that
the
parties
should
file
with
the
commission,
the
rates
that
they
adopted.
terminals
were
not
then
and
are
not
now
covered
by
any
statute
that
either
authorizes
or
requires
them
to
file
tariffs.
since
the
events
that
are
before
the
court
now
transpired,
a
regulation
was
adopted
by
the
maritime
commission
which
said
terminals
should
file
tariffs.
it
doesn't
command
obedience
to
such
tariffs.
there
is
such
a
regulation
but
there
was
not
such
a
regulation
at
any
relevant
time.
the
agreement
that
authorize
the
terminal
companies
in
boston
to
adopt
port-wide
uniform
rates.
the
tariff
that
was
filed
under
that
agreement
contained
a
series
of
definitions.
one
of
which
was
a
definition
of
something
called
wharf
demurrage
and
it
said
the
wharf
demurrage
was
the
charge
that
is
imposed
against
the
consignees
of
import
cargo
when
the
cargo
stays
and
appear
beyond
free
time.
and
free
time
was
defined
by
these
terminals.
they
were
the
only
people
who
prescribed
this
rule.
free
time
was
defined
as
five
days,
meaning
that
after
the
cargo
has
landed,
the
consignee
has
that
much
time
to
pick
it
up
before
somebody
makes
him
pay
storage
on
it.
and
wharf
demurrage
was
explicitly
characterized
as
a
charge
against
cargo,
not
merely
as
a
charge
against
cargo
but
as
a
charge
against
the
consignee
of
import
cargo
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
consignees
don't
like
to
pay
charges
on
cargo
when
it
is
tied
up
on
the
dock
by
a
strike.
nobody
does,
you
can't
move
the
cargo
off
because
the
pier
is
picketing.
so
the
consignees
were
giving
a
warehouse,
the
terminal
people
trouble
in
collecting
the
charge
so
the
terminal
interest
said,
well,
let
us
try
getting
it
out
of
the
carriers,
so
that
it
will
be
easier
to
collect
from
them.
so
while
tariffs
still
contain
a
definition
of
wharf
demurrage
as
a
charge
against
cargo
and
against
the
consignee
of
import
cargo,
a
provision
was
added
to
the
tariff
which
said
contemporaneously
with
what
i
have
just
explained
that
where
the
cargo
was
non-removable
because
of
strike
conditions.
wharf
demurrage
would
be
collected
from
the
ocean
carrier.
eventually,
the
term
“wharf
demurrage”
in
that
connection
was
supplemented
by
a
term
called
“strike
storage”
which
initially
appeared
in
the
tariff
under
the
heading
wharf
demurrage
when
that
inconsistency
was
perceived
it
was
moved
to
some
place
in
the
back
of
the
tariff
but
the
terminal
address
were
so
confused
about
what
thy
were
doing
that
they
even
defined
strikes
storage
and
defined
it
as
a
charge
against
cargo
and
against
the
consignees
of
import
cargo
not
as
a
charge
against
the
vessel.
so
they
had
inconsistent
definitions
in
their
tariffs
the
entire
time.
now,
the
question
here
is
what
were
they
entitled
to
do
under
agreement
8785
under
which
the
terminal
organization
created
itself
and
which
was
approved
by
the
maritime
commission.
what
the
agreement
said
was
on
the
subject
of
its
coverage
was
said
in
four
lines
in
paragraph
third
of
the
agreement
and
it
said,
“that
the
terminals
could
impose
--
could
adopt
and
impose
uniform
charges
for
stated
services.”
they
were
listed
specifically.
the
only
one
of
them
that
was
relevant
here
was
wharf
demurrage.
and
wharf
demurrage
was
not
only
about
to
be
defined
within
a
few
days
in
the
tariffs
that
was
to
be
filed
under
this
agreement
but
had
been
the
subject
of
a
half
a
dozen
or
a
dozen
cases
before
the
maritime
commission
which
we
cite
under
which
the
commission
had
always
held
that
demurrage
--
that
wharf
demurrage
was
a
charge
against
cargo.
it
had
had
case
after
case
to
determine.
the
assignment
of
particular
charges
was
particular
terminals
services
and
had
always
come
up
with
the
settled
an
unbroken
line
of
decision
that
these
charges
were
charges
against
cargo.
consequently,
it
is
our
position
that
when
the
maritime
commission
approved
an
agreement
which
authorized
terminal
operators
to
make
collective
charges
for
wharf
demurrage,
they
were
authorizing
charges
which
were
recognized
by
industry
recognized
by
the
commission,
recognized
by
everybody
as
subsequently
proved
by
the
definitions
in
the
tariff
to
be
charges
against
cargo
remaining
on
the
dock
after
the
period
of
free
time.
the
question
as
to
what
the
agreement
meant
is
of
foremost
importance
in
this
case
because
whatever
it
meant
originally
when
wharf
demurrage
was
imposed
as
a
charge
against
cargo,
it
suddenly
became
to
mean
something
that
exact
opposite
when
wharf
demurrage
was
assessed
against
the
vessel.
in
other
words,
there
was
an
explicit
change
in
the
incidence
of
specific
charge.
it
was
as
radical
a
change
as
you
could
possibly
get.
the
participation
of
the
swedish
transatlantic
line
in
this
case
came
about
in
stages.
swedish
transatlantic
is
a
swedish
corporation
operating
swedish
flag
vessels
and
it
is
based
in
gothenburg,
sweden.
and
like
many
foreign
steamship
lines,
its
interests
are
served
in
the
united
states
by
an
agent
and
in
the
port
of
boston
its
agent
was
furness,
withy
&
company.
furness,
withy
and
company
was
one
a
member
of
the
boston
shipping
association,
swedish
transatlantic
line
was
not
when
this
lawsuit
was
started
for
the
recovery
of
terminal
charges
wharf
demurrage
for
a
cargo
that
was
tied
up
in
consequence
of
the
strike.
furness,
withy
was
made
the
defendant
in
the
case.
swedish
transatlantic
was
not
made
the
defendant.
there
are
a
number
of
statements
recorded
by
mr.
reed
on
our
part
to
the
effect
that
furness
--
that
transatlantic
was
represented
by
furness,
withy.
there
is
even
a
statement
at
some
place
that
it
was
represented
by
counsel
for
furness,
withy.
i
don't
know
that
that's
saying
anything
different.
in
any
event,
when
i
first
heard
about
this
case
from
swedish
transatlantic
lines,
the
maritime
commission
had
made
its
decision
after
judge
wyzanski
in
boston
had
stayed
the
case
pending
before
him
and
ordered
to
let
the
defendants
in
that
case
seek
a
ruling
from
the
maritime
commission
on
the
lawfulness
and
reasonableness
of
the
contested
demurrage
charges.
promptly,
upon
receiving
a
communication
from
swedish
transatlantic
which
was
in
something
of
a
quandary
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
boston
and
where
it
is
stored
and
what
its
relation
to
the
case
might
have
been.
i
took
measures
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
maritime
commission
that
the
switch
in
the
incidence
of
this
tariff
charges
for
a
wharf
demurrage
appeared
to
be
in
conflict
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
the
maritime
commission
decision
preceded
this
court's
decision
in
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
my
reference
to
the
volkswagenwerk
case
in
the
petition
to
the
maritime
commission
for
reconsideration
came
after
certainly
some
delay
following
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
it
came
immediately
upon
my
--
the
inception
of
my
relationship
with
swedish
transatlantic.
now,
whether
mr.
justice
harlan,
whether
swedish
transatlantic
was
a
party
to
the
boston
proceedings
in
the
circumstances,
whether
the
maritime
commission
proceedings
is
conceivably
arguable
but
mr.
justice
--
now
judge
aldridge
ordered
in
boston
held
distinctly
as
i
read
his
opinion
that
it
was
not
in
any
event
whether
it
was
a
party
or
not
a
party.
it
was
not
a
party
in
any
sense
that
was
meaningful
as
regards
the
protection
of
its
own
interest
because
judge
wyzanski
admitted
transatlantic
the
intervention
in
his
case
on
a
representation
that
transatlantic
was
inadequately
represented
by
furness,
withy
and
company.
one
reason
that
was
inadequately
represented
is
that
furness
--
was
the
judgment
against
furness,
withy
wasn't
going
to
cost
furness,
withy
anything
as
far
as
transatlantic
was
concerned
because
it
was
going
to
claim
indemnification.
mr.
george
f.
galland
step
with
the
district
court's
judgment
by
which
i
don't
concede
that
we
didn't
have
the
right
to
appeal
from
it
or
that
and
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
if
we
were
in
a
relationship
which
this
court
holds
to
be
full-fledged
privity
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
no,
i
say
that
we
were
not
because
the
furness,
withy
and
company
had
no
incentive
to
resist.
the
judgment
against
them
as
agent
was
not
going
to
cost
them
a
thing.
there
was
another
factor
that
furness,
withy
had
caved
in
and
already
paid
some
of
the
charges
when
the
swedish
transatlantic
came
along,
so
it
was
going
to
look
pretty
silly
to
some
of
its
other
principles
if
transatlantic
upset
the
apple
cart.
furness,
withy's
lawyer
filed
an
appeal
late
from
the
maritime
commission
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
so
that
our
position
was
that
furness,
withy
did
not
have
an
incentive
to
do
a
good
job
and
adequate
job
of
representation
and
didn't
in
fact
do
a
good
job
of
representation
and
that
is
why
judge
wyzanski
admitted
swedish
transatlantic
to
the
case
before
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
he
admits
swedish
transatlantic
because
its
interest
weren't
otherwise
adequately
protected
that
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
say
that
swedish
transatlantic
had
its
day
in
court
before
the
maritime
commission.
now,
getting
back
to
the
consequences
of
a
ruling
of
the
district
court
ruling
and
the
evils
that
flow
from
it,
i
like
to
say
the
following
circumstances.
such
a
ruling
would
mean
that
the
maritime
commission's
decision
which
we
claimed
to
be
at
odds
with
the
volkswagenwerk
case
would
become
the
governing
decision
controlling
a
subsequent
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
any
event
of
reversal
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
even
though
this
court
had
subsequently
that
the
maritime
commission's
decision
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case
to
the
effect
that
the
maritime
commission
decision
was
wrong.
now,
i
see
no
reason
in
the
world
why
a
maritime
commission
decision
that
is
correctable
should
be
permitted
to
stand
in
conflict
with
the
subsequent
decision
of
this
court.
and
the
conflict
involves
not
equable
and
not
a
detail
but
a
matter
of
high
administrative
policy.
it
has
to
do
with
the
administration
of
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
which
is
the
real
gut
of
that
act
as
a
regulatory
mechanism.
regulation
under
the
shipping
act
is
different
from
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
because
the
shipping
act
deals
with
foreign
commerce
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
hold
of
only
one
end
of
the
transaction.
every
bit
of
fmc
regulation
of
foreign
shipping
has
diplomatic
overturns
and
the
commission
can
not
do
a
great
deal
by
way
of
direct
regulation
and
therefore
what
it
does
do
is
done
by
way
of
governmental
policing
of
a
system
of
self-regulation
carried
out
by
the
shipping
conferences
and
it
is
--
most
rates
in
ocean
trade
are
conference
made
conference
control
on
the
basis
of
tariffs
filed
under
approved
agreements.
it's
important
to
understand
how
these
agreements
are
made
and
what
the
procedure
is
for
their
approval
or
there
disapproval.
the
agreements
are
negotiated
in
conversation
among
the
lines
that
will
adopt
the
uniform
rate
schedule
under
them.
and
they
are
then
filed
with
the
commission.
in
the
old
days,
the
commission
used
to
post
them
on
a
bulletin
board
in
a
dark
(inaudible)
and
if
nobody
objected
within
20
minutes
they
would
get
their
little
round
rubber
stamp
and
put
approved
on
it
and
it
would
be
approved.
that
system
was
condemned
by
judge
frank
in
one
of
the
earliest
branson
cases
in
96
federal
supplement.
in
the
course
of
that
case,
one
of
the
attorneys
brought
out
a
cross-examination
that
the
commission
didn't
even
own
a
little
round
rubber
stamp
that
said
disapproved.
now,
when
an
agreement
is
filed
it
is
noticed
under
internal
procedures
of
the
internal
administrative
orders
of
the
commission.
it
is
filed
with
the
federal
register
in
an
announcement
of
the
agreement
appears
in
the
federal
register.
the
register
is
read
by
people
who
are
interested
in
commission
proceedings
and
anybody
who
sees
an
agreement
which
appears
to
affect
his
interest
is
in
at
liberty
to
file
a
protest
or
a
comment
and
to
demand
a
hearing
if
he
is
so
advised.
now,
the
importance
of
the
volkswagenwerk
decision
and
all
decisions
alike
having
to
do
with
changes
in
the
incidence
of
charges
under
such
agreement
is
that
when
an
agreement
is
announced
to
the
public,
only
the
people
upon
whom
that
agreement
has
a
recognizable
incidence
have
any
motivation
to
oppose
the
agreement
or
to
appear
in
proceedings
concerning
its
approval
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
their
interest.
if
when
they
read
a
summary
of
the
agreement
in
the
federal
register
they
find
that
it
affects
only
their
antagonist
in
the
business
transaction,
they
stay
away
and
the
agreement
is
approved.
when
agreement
8785
was
noticed
in
the
federal
register
announcing
that
the
terminals
were
seeking
the
right
to
make
uniform
rates
relative
to
wharf
demurrage,
no
ocean
carrier
had
any
incentive
to
appear
to
object
to
that
agreement
because
by
long
and
settled
--
a
long
and
settled
series
of
determinations
of
the
commission
wharf
demurrage
was
payable
not
by
the
carrier
interest
but
by
the
cargo
interest.
the
agreement
was
approved
without
participation
by
the
carrier
interest
and
after
a
period
of
imposing
wharf
demurrage
on
the
cargo
and
not
being
able
to
collect
it
then
the
parties
to
the
agreement
say
let's
try
and
get
it
from
the
carriers
instead
of
the
cargo,
so
we
we'll
do
a
little
tariff
switch
and
without
seeking
any
amendment
to
the
agreement
that
the
carriers
would
have
any
opportunity
to
oppose
they
make
this
a
charge
against
the
carriers.
the
government
says,
well
the
agreement
was
approved.
the
only
thing
that
wasn't
fixed
is
the
question
who
pays
the
charge.
and
they
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief
saying
the
question
who
pays
the
charges,
usually
the
difference
between
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
and
judgment
for
the
defendant
and
it
is
more
than
a
trivial
item
in
most
lawsuit.
in
any
event,
there
is
simply
no
limit
on
the
possibilities
for
economic
predation
if
a
group
of
price
fixers
is
permitted
to
organize
itself
and
advertise
that
it
plans
to
fix
prices
to
be
paid
by
one
group
if
after
it
gets
approval
for
such
an
agreement
it
can
without
any
control
or
whatever
switch
the
incidence
of
its
price
fixing
arrangements
to
a
different
group.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
entire
mechanism
of
control
under
the
shipping
act
is
destroyed
if
that
type
of
administration
of
the
shipping
act
is
countenanced,
and
consequently
i
say
that
in
terms
of
precept
of
the
southern
steamship
case
this
court
should
do
everything
possible
to
see
that
that
kind
of
administration
is
not
tolerated.
in
additional,
black
mark
against
the
maritime
commission
in
this
case
is
that
in
writing
a
16-page
printed
opinion
construing
the
agreement
of
this
terminal
association,
it
never
quoted
the
four
lines
of
language
which
were
the
only
four
lines
that
are
relevant
to
its
decision.
it
paraphrased
them
and
it
distorted
them
in
the
paraphrase.
another
very
basic
feature
of
the
maritime
commission's
regulatory
program
under
the
shipping
act
is
the
integrity
of
the
tariff
system.
for
quite
a
long
time
under
the
shipping
act,
tariffs
were
not
required
as
they
are
required
under
all
transportation
and
public
utility
statutes
of
domestic
utilities
and
carriers.
by
administrative
regulation,
it
used
to
be
that
carriers
in
foreign
commerce
had
to
file
their
tariffs
30
days
after
they
became
effective.
merely,
as
a
matter
of
information
but
there
was
no
requirement
that
any
carrier
had
to
adhere
to
a
tariff
rate
because
he
could
always
change
it
and
file
a
change
within
30
days.
in
1961,
congress
changed
that
with
amendments
to
the
shipping
act
which
added
tariff
filing
requirements
similar
to
those
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
federal
aviation
act
and
the
federal
communications
act
and
all
the
others.
so
that
there
is
now
a
provision
that
a
tariff
of
a
common
carrier
in
foreign
commerce
must:
(a)
be
filed
in
a
public
place
and
(b)
must
be
observed,
so
that
the
tariff
rates
becomes
the
lawful
rates
for
ocean
carriers
in
foreign
trade
as
they
are
for
a
railroad
company
or
an
airline.
and
the
tariff
that
was
filed
by
swedish
transatlantic
line
said
in
two
places,
one
in
the
rules
of
the
tariff
itself
and
the
other
was
in
the
bill
of
lading
filed
as
a
part
of
the
tariff
pursuant
to
law.
that
the
obligation
of
swedish
transatlantic
line
began
when
it
picked
the
cargo
up
at
ships
tackle
and
ended
when
it
put
it
down.
and
the
commission's
decision
totally
ignores
that
tariff
in
favor
of
a
tariff
which
is
totally
non-official
filed
by
the
terminal
operators
in
this
case
so
that
the
force
of
law
is
attached
to
the
terminal
tariff
which
is
filed
only
pursuant
to
a
private
agreement
and
is
nowhere
sanctioned
by
statute
and
it
was
not
even
sanctioned
by
a
commission
regulation
at
that
time,
and
it
disregards
the
legally
mandatory
tariff
of
the
ocean
carrier.
to
do
that
in
conjunction
with
the
erosion
of
controls
under
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
is
to
throw
away
every
wholesome
and
usual
aspect
of
the
regulatory
program
administered
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
and
i
suggest
that
if
there
is
any
way
out
this
court
should
certainly
not
enshrine
as
the
law
of
this
case
and
for
future
cases.
the
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
of
the
district
court
in
boston
which
blindly
adopted
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission,
if
there
is
any
good
way
to
rationalize
a
contrary
decision,
i
have
submitted
in
our
brief
and
mr.
justice
white
has
suggested
some
of
the
arguments
for
such
rationalization.
it
has
been
true
in
at
least
three
major
recent
cases,
fairly
recent
cases
of
this
court
beginning
with
mr.
black's
decision
in
u.s.
against
icc
and
on
through
the
consolo
case
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
written
by
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
court
has
recognized
the
statutes
in
this
area
as
such
a
hodge-podge
that
some
sense
has
to
be
breathe
in
to
them
judicially.
but
it
is
not
hard
to
breathe
a
rationalization
into
the
--
into
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
because
you
have
available
to
you
in
explicit
connective
between
the
procedure
under
the
shipping
act
and
the
procedure
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
it's
true
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
certain
maritime
commission
orders
was
lodged
in
the
court
of
appeals
instead
of
in
the
district
courts
but
for
a
very
limited
purpose.
one
was
to
avoid
the
inconvenience
of
convening
three-judge
district
courts.
the
other
was
to
save
this
court
from
mandatory
appeals
from
the
three-judge
district
courts.
there
is
no
sense
that
i
can
seek
because
there
was
no
further
purpose
in
expanding
the
judicial
review
act
to
necessitate
multiple
proceedings
in
order
to
get
rid
of
cases.
everything
that
the
government
has
told
this
court
in
this
case
as
to
how
desirable
it
is
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
government
--
of
what
the
justice
department
told
congress
when
the
justice
department
sponsored
the
amendment
of
the
title
28
which
provided
that
when
cases
are
referred
to
the
icc,
the
icc
is
reviewed
by
the
referring
court.
now,
i
think
i
can
finish
in
the
next
two
or
three
minutes
if
the
court
can
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
--
can
indulge.
mr.
george
f.
galland
that
hasn't
always
been
sir.
but
there
is
in
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
judicial
review
act.
there
is
not
in-going
to
a
district
court
except
on
this
under
1336
(c)
of
title
28
with
mr.
friedman
mentioned
and
i
really
don't,
i
have
a
little
trouble
connecting
up
what
the
statute
says
with
the
argument
that
he
made
from
it.
paragraph
c
of
section
1336,
any
action
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
thank
you.
“any
action
brought
under
subsection
(b)
of
this
section
shall
be
filed
within
90
days
from
the
date
that
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
becomes
final.
but
the
action
in
this
case
was
always
on
file
from
long
before
the
commission
made
its
decision.
judge
wyzanski
explicitly
retained
jurisdiction
and
called
for
periodic
reports
back
from
the
parties
as
to
how
they
were
doing
it
with
them
before
the
commission.
so
that
the
action
was
always
pending
and
i
don't
see
that
there
is
the
slightest
impediment
in
terms
of
this
90-day
limitation
mr.
justice
white
to
the
intervention
of
swedish
transatlantic
line
to
make
the
points
that
it
made.
i
think
that's
i
can
sacrifice
whatever
additional
time
i
have.
mr.
george
f.
galland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
interrogation
has
--
from
the
bench
has
indicated
this
is
a
very
hard
case
to
compress
and
focus.
it
tends
to
break
itself
apart
into
one
uncommon
number
of
issues
for
a
case
of
itself.
i
tend
to
think
that
an
item
of
wisdom
dispensed
by
this
court
would
many
years
ago
in
the
southern
steamship
case.
it
offers
good
guidance
here.
the
southern
steamship
case
was
a
case
where
a
crew
of
a
steamship
can
not
make,
had
mutinied
in
a
foreign
port
and
were
fired.
when
they
got
home,
they
brought
a
proceeding
against
the
employer
charging
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
firing
because
they
had
mutinied
and
labor
board
said
that
was
right,
it
was
unfit.
this
court
have
said
determination
considered
as
sufficient
for
this
case
to
observe
that
the
board
has
not
been
commissioned
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
labor
relations
act
so
single-mindedly
that
it
may
wholly
ignore
other
and
equally
important
congressional
objectives.
frequently,
the
entire
scope
of
congressional
purpose
calls
for
careful
accommodation
of
one
statutory
scheme
to
another
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
demand
of
an
administrative
body
that
it
undertake
this
accommodation
without
excessive
emphasis
upon
its
immediate
task.
that
seems
to
me
that
to
determine
this
case
within
the
contracts
of
the
explicit
language
of
the
administrative
orders
review
act.
in
the
one
sentence
that
says
the
court
of
appeals
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
certain
final
orders
of
the
maritime
commission
is
to
perpetuate
a
list
of
additional
administrative
horrors
that
should
not
be
countenance
by
this
court
or
by
any
court
in
the
judicial
system,
if
there
is
any
rational
way
to
get
away
from
it.
this
case
started
out
with
a
lawsuit
in
boston
first
in
the
state
court
was
transferred
over
to
the
united
states
district
court
which
sought
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
something
called
the
tariff
which
had
been
filed
by
a
group
of
terminal
warehouses
with
the
federal
maritime
commission.
i
say
it
was
called
a
tariff
because
it
was
really
just
a
price
list
that
had
no
sanction
except
the
private
agreement
among
the
parties
that
had
been
approved
at
one
time
in
1962
by
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
which
had
the
provision
and
it
is
saying
that
the
parties
should
file
with
the
commission,
the
rates
that
they
adopted.
terminals
were
not
then
and
are
not
now
covered
by
any
statute
that
either
authorizes
or
requires
them
to
file
tariffs.
since
the
events
that
are
before
the
court
now
transpired,
a
regulation
was
adopted
by
the
maritime
commission
which
said
terminals
should
file
tariffs.
it
doesn't
command
obedience
to
such
tariffs.
there
is
such
a
regulation
but
there
was
not
such
a
regulation
at
any
relevant
time.
the
agreement
that
authorize
the
terminal
companies
in
boston
to
adopt
port-wide
uniform
rates.
the
tariff
that
was
filed
under
that
agreement
contained
a
series
of
definitions.
one
of
which
was
a
definition
of
something
called
wharf
demurrage
and
it
said
the
wharf
demurrage
was
the
charge
that
is
imposed
against
the
consignees
of
import
cargo
when
the
cargo
stays
and
appear
beyond
free
time.
and
free
time
was
defined
by
these
terminals.
they
were
the
only
people
who
prescribed
this
rule.
free
time
was
defined
as
five
days,
meaning
that
after
the
cargo
has
landed,
the
consignee
has
that
much
time
to
pick
it
up
before
somebody
makes
him
pay
storage
on
it.
and
wharf
demurrage
was
explicitly
characterized
as
a
charge
against
cargo,
not
merely
as
a
charge
against
cargo
but
as
a
charge
against
the
consignee
of
import
cargo
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
consignees
don't
like
to
pay
charges
on
cargo
when
it
is
tied
up
on
the
dock
by
a
strike.
nobody
does,
you
can't
move
the
cargo
off
because
the
pier
is
picketing.
so
the
consignees
were
giving
a
warehouse,
the
terminal
people
trouble
in
collecting
the
charge
so
the
terminal
interest
said,
well,
let
us
try
getting
it
out
of
the
carriers,
so
that
it
will
be
easier
to
collect
from
them.
so
while
tariffs
still
contain
a
definition
of
wharf
demurrage
as
a
charge
against
cargo
and
against
the
consignee
of
import
cargo,
a
provision
was
added
to
the
tariff
which
said
contemporaneously
with
what
i
have
just
explained
that
where
the
cargo
was
non-removable
because
of
strike
conditions.
wharf
demurrage
would
be
collected
from
the
ocean
carrier.
eventually,
the
term
“wharf
demurrage”
in
that
connection
was
supplemented
by
a
term
called
“strike
storage”
which
initially
appeared
in
the
tariff
under
the
heading
wharf
demurrage
when
that
inconsistency
was
perceived
it
was
moved
to
some
place
in
the
back
of
the
tariff
but
the
terminal
address
were
so
confused
about
what
thy
were
doing
that
they
even
defined
strikes
storage
and
defined
it
as
a
charge
against
cargo
and
against
the
consignees
of
import
cargo
not
as
a
charge
against
the
vessel.
so
they
had
inconsistent
definitions
in
their
tariffs
the
entire
time.
now,
the
question
here
is
what
were
they
entitled
to
do
under
agreement
8785
under
which
the
terminal
organization
created
itself
and
which
was
approved
by
the
maritime
commission.
what
the
agreement
said
was
on
the
subject
of
its
coverage
was
said
in
four
lines
in
paragraph
third
of
the
agreement
and
it
said,
“that
the
terminals
could
impose
--
could
adopt
and
impose
uniform
charges
for
stated
services.”
they
were
listed
specifically.
the
only
one
of
them
that
was
relevant
here
was
wharf
demurrage.
and
wharf
demurrage
was
not
only
about
to
be
defined
within
a
few
days
in
the
tariffs
that
was
to
be
filed
under
this
agreement
but
had
been
the
subject
of
a
half
a
dozen
or
a
dozen
cases
before
the
maritime
commission
which
we
cite
under
which
the
commission
had
always
held
that
demurrage
--
that
wharf
demurrage
was
a
charge
against
cargo.
it
had
had
case
after
case
to
determine.
the
assignment
of
particular
charges
was
particular
terminals
services
and
had
always
come
up
with
the
settled
an
unbroken
line
of
decision
that
these
charges
were
charges
against
cargo.
consequently,
it
is
our
position
that
when
the
maritime
commission
approved
an
agreement
which
authorized
terminal
operators
to
make
collective
charges
for
wharf
demurrage,
they
were
authorizing
charges
which
were
recognized
by
industry
recognized
by
the
commission,
recognized
by
everybody
as
subsequently
proved
by
the
definitions
in
the
tariff
to
be
charges
against
cargo
remaining
on
the
dock
after
the
period
of
free
time.
the
question
as
to
what
the
agreement
meant
is
of
foremost
importance
in
this
case
because
whatever
it
meant
originally
when
wharf
demurrage
was
imposed
as
a
charge
against
cargo,
it
suddenly
became
to
mean
something
that
exact
opposite
when
wharf
demurrage
was
assessed
against
the
vessel.
in
other
words,
there
was
an
explicit
change
in
the
incidence
of
specific
charge.
it
was
as
radical
a
change
as
you
could
possibly
get.
the
participation
of
the
swedish
transatlantic
line
in
this
case
came
about
in
stages.
swedish
transatlantic
is
a
swedish
corporation
operating
swedish
flag
vessels
and
it
is
based
in
gothenburg,
sweden.
and
like
many
foreign
steamship
lines,
its
interests
are
served
in
the
united
states
by
an
agent
and
in
the
port
of
boston
its
agent
was
furness,
withy
&
company.
furness,
withy
and
company
was
one
a
member
of
the
boston
shipping
association,
swedish
transatlantic
line
was
not
when
this
lawsuit
was
started
for
the
recovery
of
terminal
charges
wharf
demurrage
for
a
cargo
that
was
tied
up
in
consequence
of
the
strike.
furness,
withy
was
made
the
defendant
in
the
case.
swedish
transatlantic
was
not
made
the
defendant.
there
are
a
number
of
statements
recorded
by
mr.
reed
on
our
part
to
the
effect
that
furness
--
that
transatlantic
was
represented
by
furness,
withy.
there
is
even
a
statement
at
some
place
that
it
was
represented
by
counsel
for
furness,
withy.
i
don't
know
that
that's
saying
anything
different.
in
any
event,
when
i
first
heard
about
this
case
from
swedish
transatlantic
lines,
the
maritime
commission
had
made
its
decision
after
judge
wyzanski
in
boston
had
stayed
the
case
pending
before
him
and
ordered
to
let
the
defendants
in
that
case
seek
a
ruling
from
the
maritime
commission
on
the
lawfulness
and
reasonableness
of
the
contested
demurrage
charges.
promptly,
upon
receiving
a
communication
from
swedish
transatlantic
which
was
in
something
of
a
quandary
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
boston
and
where
it
is
stored
and
what
its
relation
to
the
case
might
have
been.
i
took
measures
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
maritime
commission
that
the
switch
in
the
incidence
of
this
tariff
charges
for
a
wharf
demurrage
appeared
to
be
in
conflict
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
the
maritime
commission
decision
preceded
this
court's
decision
in
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
my
reference
to
the
volkswagenwerk
case
in
the
petition
to
the
maritime
commission
for
reconsideration
came
after
certainly
some
delay
following
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
it
came
immediately
upon
my
--
the
inception
of
my
relationship
with
swedish
transatlantic.
now,
whether
mr.
justice
harlan,
whether
swedish
transatlantic
was
a
party
to
the
boston
proceedings
in
the
circumstances,
whether
the
maritime
commission
proceedings
is
conceivably
arguable
but
mr.
justice
--
now
judge
aldridge
ordered
in
boston
held
distinctly
as
i
read
his
opinion
that
it
was
not
in
any
event
whether
it
was
a
party
or
not
a
party.
it
was
not
a
party
in
any
sense
that
was
meaningful
as
regards
the
protection
of
its
own
interest
because
judge
wyzanski
admitted
transatlantic
the
intervention
in
his
case
on
a
representation
that
transatlantic
was
inadequately
represented
by
furness,
withy
and
company.
one
reason
that
was
inadequately
represented
is
that
furness
--
was
the
judgment
against
furness,
withy
wasn't
going
to
cost
furness,
withy
anything
as
far
as
transatlantic
was
concerned
because
it
was
going
to
claim
indemnification.
mr.
george
f.
galland
step
with
the
district
court's
judgment
by
which
i
don't
concede
that
we
didn't
have
the
right
to
appeal
from
it
or
that
and
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
if
we
were
in
a
relationship
which
this
court
holds
to
be
full-fledged
privity
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
no,
i
say
that
we
were
not
because
the
furness,
withy
and
company
had
no
incentive
to
resist.
the
judgment
against
them
as
agent
was
not
going
to
cost
them
a
thing.
there
was
another
factor
that
furness,
withy
had
caved
in
and
already
paid
some
of
the
charges
when
the
swedish
transatlantic
came
along,
so
it
was
going
to
look
pretty
silly
to
some
of
its
other
principles
if
transatlantic
upset
the
apple
cart.
furness,
withy's
lawyer
filed
an
appeal
late
from
the
maritime
commission
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
so
that
our
position
was
that
furness,
withy
did
not
have
an
incentive
to
do
a
good
job
and
adequate
job
of
representation
and
didn't
in
fact
do
a
good
job
of
representation
and
that
is
why
judge
wyzanski
admitted
swedish
transatlantic
to
the
case
before
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
he
admits
swedish
transatlantic
because
its
interest
weren't
otherwise
adequately
protected
that
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
say
that
swedish
transatlantic
had
its
day
in
court
before
the
maritime
commission.
now,
getting
back
to
the
consequences
of
a
ruling
of
the
district
court
ruling
and
the
evils
that
flow
from
it,
i
like
to
say
the
following
circumstances.
such
a
ruling
would
mean
that
the
maritime
commission's
decision
which
we
claimed
to
be
at
odds
with
the
volkswagenwerk
case
would
become
the
governing
decision
controlling
a
subsequent
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
any
event
of
reversal
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
even
though
this
court
had
subsequently
that
the
maritime
commission's
decision
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case
to
the
effect
that
the
maritime
commission
decision
was
wrong.
now,
i
see
no
reason
in
the
world
why
a
maritime
commission
decision
that
is
correctable
should
be
permitted
to
stand
in
conflict
with
the
subsequent
decision
of
this
court.
and
the
conflict
involves
not
equable
and
not
a
detail
but
a
matter
of
high
administrative
policy.
it
has
to
do
with
the
administration
of
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
which
is
the
real
gut
of
that
act
as
a
regulatory
mechanism.
regulation
under
the
shipping
act
is
different
from
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
because
the
shipping
act
deals
with
foreign
commerce
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
hold
of
only
one
end
of
the
transaction.
every
bit
of
fmc
regulation
of
foreign
shipping
has
diplomatic
overturns
and
the
commission
can
not
do
a
great
deal
by
way
of
direct
regulation
and
therefore
what
it
does
do
is
done
by
way
of
governmental
policing
of
a
system
of
self-regulation
carried
out
by
the
shipping
conferences
and
it
is
--
most
rates
in
ocean
trade
are
conference
made
conference
control
on
the
basis
of
tariffs
filed
under
approved
agreements.
it's
important
to
understand
how
these
agreements
are
made
and
what
the
procedure
is
for
their
approval
or
there
disapproval.
the
agreements
are
negotiated
in
conversation
among
the
lines
that
will
adopt
the
uniform
rate
schedule
under
them.
and
they
are
then
filed
with
the
commission.
in
the
old
days,
the
commission
used
to
post
them
on
a
bulletin
board
in
a
dark
(inaudible)
and
if
nobody
objected
within
20
minutes
they
would
get
their
little
round
rubber
stamp
and
put
approved
on
it
and
it
would
be
approved.
that
system
was
condemned
by
judge
frank
in
one
of
the
earliest
branson
cases
in
96
federal
supplement.
in
the
course
of
that
case,
one
of
the
attorneys
brought
out
a
cross-examination
that
the
commission
didn't
even
own
a
little
round
rubber
stamp
that
said
disapproved.
now,
when
an
agreement
is
filed
it
is
noticed
under
internal
procedures
of
the
internal
administrative
orders
of
the
commission.
it
is
filed
with
the
federal
register
in
an
announcement
of
the
agreement
appears
in
the
federal
register.
the
register
is
read
by
people
who
are
interested
in
commission
proceedings
and
anybody
who
sees
an
agreement
which
appears
to
affect
his
interest
is
in
at
liberty
to
file
a
protest
or
a
comment
and
to
demand
a
hearing
if
he
is
so
advised.
now,
the
importance
of
the
volkswagenwerk
decision
and
all
decisions
alike
having
to
do
with
changes
in
the
incidence
of
charges
under
such
agreement
is
that
when
an
agreement
is
announced
to
the
public,
only
the
people
upon
whom
that
agreement
has
a
recognizable
incidence
have
any
motivation
to
oppose
the
agreement
or
to
appear
in
proceedings
concerning
its
approval
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
their
interest.
if
when
they
read
a
summary
of
the
agreement
in
the
federal
register
they
find
that
it
affects
only
their
antagonist
in
the
business
transaction,
they
stay
away
and
the
agreement
is
approved.
when
agreement
8785
was
noticed
in
the
federal
register
announcing
that
the
terminals
were
seeking
the
right
to
make
uniform
rates
relative
to
wharf
demurrage,
no
ocean
carrier
had
any
incentive
to
appear
to
object
to
that
agreement
because
by
long
and
settled
--
a
long
and
settled
series
of
determinations
of
the
commission
wharf
demurrage
was
payable
not
by
the
carrier
interest
but
by
the
cargo
interest.
the
agreement
was
approved
without
participation
by
the
carrier
interest
and
after
a
period
of
imposing
wharf
demurrage
on
the
cargo
and
not
being
able
to
collect
it
then
the
parties
to
the
agreement
say
let's
try
and
get
it
from
the
carriers
instead
of
the
cargo,
so
we
we'll
do
a
little
tariff
switch
and
without
seeking
any
amendment
to
the
agreement
that
the
carriers
would
have
any
opportunity
to
oppose
they
make
this
a
charge
against
the
carriers.
the
government
says,
well
the
agreement
was
approved.
the
only
thing
that
wasn't
fixed
is
the
question
who
pays
the
charge.
and
they
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief
saying
the
question
who
pays
the
charges,
usually
the
difference
between
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
and
judgment
for
the
defendant
and
it
is
more
than
a
trivial
item
in
most
lawsuit.
in
any
event,
there
is
simply
no
limit
on
the
possibilities
for
economic
predation
if
a
group
of
price
fixers
is
permitted
to
organize
itself
and
advertise
that
it
plans
to
fix
prices
to
be
paid
by
one
group
if
after
it
gets
approval
for
such
an
agreement
it
can
without
any
control
or
whatever
switch
the
incidence
of
its
price
fixing
arrangements
to
a
different
group.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
entire
mechanism
of
control
under
the
shipping
act
is
destroyed
if
that
type
of
administration
of
the
shipping
act
is
countenanced,
and
consequently
i
say
that
in
terms
of
precept
of
the
southern
steamship
case
this
court
should
do
everything
possible
to
see
that
that
kind
of
administration
is
not
tolerated.
in
additional,
black
mark
against
the
maritime
commission
in
this
case
is
that
in
writing
a
16-page
printed
opinion
construing
the
agreement
of
this
terminal
association,
it
never
quoted
the
four
lines
of
language
which
were
the
only
four
lines
that
are
relevant
to
its
decision.
it
paraphrased
them
and
it
distorted
them
in
the
paraphrase.
another
very
basic
feature
of
the
maritime
commission's
regulatory
program
under
the
shipping
act
is
the
integrity
of
the
tariff
system.
for
quite
a
long
time
under
the
shipping
act,
tariffs
were
not
required
as
they
are
required
under
all
transportation
and
public
utility
statutes
of
domestic
utilities
and
carriers.
by
administrative
regulation,
it
used
to
be
that
carriers
in
foreign
commerce
had
to
file
their
tariffs
30
days
after
they
became
effective.
merely,
as
a
matter
of
information
but
there
was
no
requirement
that
any
carrier
had
to
adhere
to
a
tariff
rate
because
he
could
always
change
it
and
file
a
change
within
30
days.
in
1961,
congress
changed
that
with
amendments
to
the
shipping
act
which
added
tariff
filing
requirements
similar
to
those
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
federal
aviation
act
and
the
federal
communications
act
and
all
the
others.
so
that
there
is
now
a
provision
that
a
tariff
of
a
common
carrier
in
foreign
commerce
must:
(a)
be
filed
in
a
public
place
and
(b)
must
be
observed,
so
that
the
tariff
rates
becomes
the
lawful
rates
for
ocean
carriers
in
foreign
trade
as
they
are
for
a
railroad
company
or
an
airline.
and
the
tariff
that
was
filed
by
swedish
transatlantic
line
said
in
two
places,
one
in
the
rules
of
the
tariff
itself
and
the
other
was
in
the
bill
of
lading
filed
as
a
part
of
the
tariff
pursuant
to
law.
that
the
obligation
of
swedish
transatlantic
line
began
when
it
picked
the
cargo
up
at
ships
tackle
and
ended
when
it
put
it
down.
and
the
commission's
decision
totally
ignores
that
tariff
in
favor
of
a
tariff
which
is
totally
non-official
filed
by
the
terminal
operators
in
this
case
so
that
the
force
of
law
is
attached
to
the
terminal
tariff
which
is
filed
only
pursuant
to
a
private
agreement
and
is
nowhere
sanctioned
by
statute
and
it
was
not
even
sanctioned
by
a
commission
regulation
at
that
time,
and
it
disregards
the
legally
mandatory
tariff
of
the
ocean
carrier.
to
do
that
in
conjunction
with
the
erosion
of
controls
under
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
is
to
throw
away
every
wholesome
and
usual
aspect
of
the
regulatory
program
administered
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
and
i
suggest
that
if
there
is
any
way
out
this
court
should
certainly
not
enshrine
as
the
law
of
this
case
and
for
future
cases.
the
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
of
the
district
court
in
boston
which
blindly
adopted
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission,
if
there
is
any
good
way
to
rationalize
a
contrary
decision,
i
have
submitted
in
our
brief
and
mr.
justice
white
has
suggested
some
of
the
arguments
for
such
rationalization.
it
has
been
true
in
at
least
three
major
recent
cases,
fairly
recent
cases
of
this
court
beginning
with
mr.
black's
decision
in
u.s.
against
icc
and
on
through
the
consolo
case
in
the
atlantic
coast
line
written
by
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
court
has
recognized
the
statutes
in
this
area
as
such
a
hodge-podge
that
some
sense
has
to
be
breathe
in
to
them
judicially.
but
it
is
not
hard
to
breathe
a
rationalization
into
the
--
into
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
because
you
have
available
to
you
in
explicit
connective
between
the
procedure
under
the
shipping
act
and
the
procedure
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
it's
true
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
certain
maritime
commission
orders
was
lodged
in
the
court
of
appeals
instead
of
in
the
district
courts
but
for
a
very
limited
purpose.
one
was
to
avoid
the
inconvenience
of
convening
three-judge
district
courts.
the
other
was
to
save
this
court
from
mandatory
appeals
from
the
three-judge
district
courts.
there
is
no
sense
that
i
can
seek
because
there
was
no
further
purpose
in
expanding
the
judicial
review
act
to
necessitate
multiple
proceedings
in
order
to
get
rid
of
cases.
everything
that
the
government
has
told
this
court
in
this
case
as
to
how
desirable
it
is
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
government
--
of
what
the
justice
department
told
congress
when
the
justice
department
sponsored
the
amendment
of
the
title
28
which
provided
that
when
cases
are
referred
to
the
icc,
the
icc
is
reviewed
by
the
referring
court.
now,
i
think
i
can
finish
in
the
next
two
or
three
minutes
if
the
court
can
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
--
can
indulge.
mr.
george
f.
galland
that
hasn't
always
been
sir.
but
there
is
in
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
judicial
review
act.
there
is
not
in-going
to
a
district
court
except
on
this
under
1336
(c)
of
title
28
with
mr.
friedman
mentioned
and
i
really
don't,
i
have
a
little
trouble
connecting
up
what
the
statute
says
with
the
argument
that
he
made
from
it.
paragraph
c
of
section
1336,
any
action
--
mr.
george
f.
galland
thank
you.
“any
action
brought
under
subsection
(b)
of
this
section
shall
be
filed
within
90
days
from
the
date
that
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
becomes
final.
but
the
action
in
this
case
was
always
on
file
from
long
before
the
commission
made
its
decision.
judge
wyzanski
explicitly
retained
jurisdiction
and
called
for
periodic
reports
back
from
the
parties
as
to
how
they
were
doing
it
with
them
before
the
commission.
so
that
the
action
was
always
pending
and
i
don't
see
that
there
is
the
slightest
impediment
in
terms
of
this
90-day
limitation
mr.
justice
white
to
the
intervention
of
swedish
transatlantic
line
to
make
the
points
that
it
made.
i
think
that's
i
can
sacrifice
whatever
additional
time
i
have.
