mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
here
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
an
amicus.
the
doctrine
of
primary
of
jurisdiction
that
this
court
announced
in
the
western
pacific
railway
case
in
352
united
states
comes
into
play
whenever
enforcement
of
a
claim
that
was
originally
cognizable
in
the
courts
requires
the
resolution
of
issues
which
under
a
regulatory
scheme
have
been
placed
within
the
special
competency
of
an
administrative
body.
we
think
without
question,
the
issues
raised
in
this
case
wore
those
kinds
--
that
kind
of
issue
and
were
properly
referred
to
the
federal
maritime
commission.
it
is
challenged.
the
respondent
challenges
that
and
said
there
was
no
need
for
the
reference.
the
issues
in
this
case
is
they
developed
in
the
district
court
with
the
most
technical
kind
of
issue
calling
for
specialized
knowledge
by
someone
familiar
with
the
intricacies
of
the
shipping
business
whether
or
not
when
this
particular
agreement
of
the
conference
of
the
terminal
was
approved
authorizing
them
to
fix
rates
and
charges,
whether
that
approval
carried
with
it
authorization
to
shift
the
incidence
of
a
particular
charge
of
a
cargo
kept
on
the
pier
after
five
days
when
during
the
period
of
a
longshoremen's
strike,
it
was
impossible
to
remove
that
cargo.
the
other
question
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
as
the
maritime
commission
held
that
this
change
was
not
a
new
agreement
that
required
approval
whether
the
practice
itself
was
illegal
in
violation
of
the
shipping
act.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
question
that
the
maritime
commission
has
to
decide
everyday.
and
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
or
not
what
was
done
in
this
case
constituted
proper
implementation
of
an
approved
agreement
or
a
new
agreement
or
modification
that
required
prior
commission
approval,
this
court
only
three
or
four
years
ago
held
in
the
carnation
case
that
that
was
specifically
an
issue
appropriate
for
resolution
by
the
maritime
commission.
so
we
think
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
judge
wyzanski
properly
ruled
that
this
was
a
matter
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
was
invoked.
the
commission
fully
heard
the
matter
and
the
commission
upheld
the
practices
and
the
actions
taken
by
the
group
of
terminals
in
the
port
of
boston.
and
then
the
question
comes
out,
how
is
that
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
rendered
on
this
reference
to
be
judicially
reviewed.
we
think
the
answer
that
flows
both
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
that
this
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
is
to
be
reviewed
the
same
way
as
any
other
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
by
filing
a
timely
and
proper
petition
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
the
referring
court
has
no
jurisdiction
collaterally
to
review
the
correctness
of
the
decision
of
this
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
basically
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
also
agreed
with
it,
that's
it.
under
our
analysis
there
is
no
need
to
reach
the
second
question
but
if
the
second
question
is
reached
as
we
developed
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
judge
wyzanski
correctly
upheld
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
the
starting
point
in
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
under
a
very
specific
statute
that
congress
say.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
i
would
have
to
disagree
when
you
say
in
a
referred
manner.
i
think
this
statute
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
referred
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
the
statute
mr.
justice
specifically
speaks
only
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
yes,
we
have
no
question
about
that.
the
congress
did
reversed
the
pennsylvania
case
but
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
and
it
may
well
be
that
as
a
matter
of
sound
policy
had
congress
consider
this
problem.
it
would
also
have
more
broadly
provided
for
reference
bound
for
review
by
the
referring
court
in
the
case
of
oil
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
mr.
justice
but
i
would
suggest
two
or
three
things
if
i
may
with
reference
to
the
statutory
provision.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
congressional
amendment
of
the
provision
for
review
of
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
seems
to
us
manifest
a
clear
congressional
intent
in
the
light
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case
that
unless
there
is
specific
language
providing
for
a
review
by
the
order
of
the
agency
in
the
referring
court
that
the
regular
practice
has
to
be
followed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
so
mr.
justice.
we
think
it's
a
sound
argument
and
let
me
though
put,
make
one
further
point
which
i
think
is
conclusive
on
this.
even
if
the
court
would
agree
with
the
respondent
on
that
point
that
doesn't
help
the
respondent
in
this
case
because
when
congress
amended
and
changed
the
procedures
for
a
review
of
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
whether
it
have
been
a
reference,
it
not
only
provided
that
the
referring
court
would
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
it
also
provided
that
any
such
proceeding
seeking
review
in
the
referral
court
would
have
to
be
filed
within
90
days
from
the
date
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
became
final.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
but
i
responded
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
governs
review
of
interstate
commerce
commission
orders,
there
is
no
time
limit
for
seeking
judicial
review.
unlike
most
of
the
review
provisions
there
is
no
time
limit
that
it
may
come
in
a
year
later
after
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order
and
seek
judicial
review.
but
under
this
provision,
under
section
1336
(c)
of
title
28,
it
says
explicitly
any
action
brought
on
to
subsection
(b)
which
provides
for
review
in
the
referring
court
shall
be
filed
with
a
90
days
from
the
date
that
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
becomes
final,
that
is
if
you
go
back
to
the
referring
court
following
a
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
a
reference
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
referring
court
within
90
days
after
the
order
of
the
commission
becomes
final.
and
that
was
clearly
not
done
in
this
case.
i
just
like
to
refer
briefly
to
some
of
the
dates
since
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
--
i
would
think
not
mr.
justice
in
that
type
of
an
order
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
of
the
basic
decision
that
consolo
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
then
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct?
[voice
overlap]
but
you
have
the
basic
policy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
the
carrier
itself
could
not
seek
review
at
all
under
the
decision
of
this
court.
the
carrier
--
only
the
shipper
could
seek
review
if
there
was
no
cease
and
desist
order.
only
the
shipper
could
seek
review
either
directly
or
the
carrier
could
defend
if
the
shipper
sought
enforcement.
but
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
then
the
carrier
can
seek
review.
but
i
thought
you'd
post
it
at
the
situation
where
there
is
only
a
reparation's
order.
as
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
in
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
review
orders,
because
i
think
mr.
justice
both
statutory
scheme
in
this
court
have
recognized
that
when
you're
dealing
with
reparation's
orders
you
have
a
very
special
situation.
congress
has
provided
[voice
overlap].
let
me
if
i
may
just
come
to
the
chronology
of
these
things
because
it's
very
clear
that
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
get
in
to
the
referring
court,
in
the
district
court
within
90
days
after
the
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
became
final.
however,
if
you
define
it,
the
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
in
this
case
was
rendered
in
june
1967
and
transatlantic's
motion
to
intervene
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
april
1969,
so
that's
almost
two
years.
now,
let
us
assume
however,
that
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
did
not
become
final
until
the
court
of
appeals
had
dismissed
us
untimely;
the
petition
to
review
that
was
filed
by
the
conference.
in
that
event,
it
became
final
in
march
of
1968
and
again
more
than
a
year
it
lapse
before
they
went
back
into
the
district
court
to
seek
intervention.
now
let
us
look
at
the
case
from
the
most
favorable
point
of
view
as
far
as
the
respondent
is
concerned.
let
us
assume
that
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
did
not
become
final
until
the
maritime
commission
had
rejected
the
petition
for
reconsideration
and
let
us
further
assume
that
the
final
rejection
of
that
petition
for
reconsideration
was
not
the
letter
in
october
that
is
contained
in
the
record
but
the
subsequent
letter
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
in
our
brief
which
was
sent
out
in
december
2,
1968.
again,
more
than
four
months
elapsed,
more
than
120
days
between
the
receipt
of
that
letter
which
under
any
theory
closed
the
case
and
the
action
of
the
respondent
in
seeking
to
intervene
in
the
district
court.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
under
any
theory
even
assuming
it
would
be
appropriate
to
rely
on
the
policy
of
1336
(b)
to
say
that
we
will
apply
the
same
principles
to
review
of
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
we
do
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
still
don't
come
within
the
terms
of
that
because
this
was
not
filed
with
90
days
from
the
date
that
the
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
became
final.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
administrative
orders
review
act
case.
it
says
the
procedure
for
review
of
maritime
commission
order
is
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
but
in
1950
review
of
maritime
order
was
transferred
from
the
three-judge
district
courts
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
i
assume
the
procedure
is
basically
the
same.
that
is
the
same
consideration
of
finality
parties'
etcetera.
again,
it
has
come
back
to
say
that
congress
--
the
sole
problem
that
was
before
congress
when
it
amended
the
statute
was
the
problem
of
reference
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
interpret
a
statute
that
speaks
explicitly
of
referring
the
question
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
when
it
speaks
about
having
review
of
any
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
when
it
says
that
any
proceeding
to
review
on
the
referring
court
must
be
a
review
of
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
who
can
say,
interpret
that
in
saying
well,
the
congress
despite
of
this
very
specific
and
limited
language
must
have
meant
to
trade
the
maritime
commission
as
well
as
covered
by
this
section.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
refer
to
the
two
other
these
things
in
the
time
i
have.
one
relates
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
transatlantic
should
be
deemed
to
be
a
party
to
the
commission
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
in
refusing
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
made
a
statement
that
non
parties
are
not
bound.
now,
it
would
appear
that
when
transatlantic
filed
its
petition
for
reconsideration
with
the
commission,
at
least
at
that
point
it
must
have
thought
itself
to
have
been
a
party
to
the
prior
commission
proceedings
because
under
the
commission's
rule
of
practice,
rule
16
(a)
which
we
set
forth
at
page
28
of
our
brief
that
provides
that
only
a
party
may
seek
reconsideration
and
if
transatlantic
was
not
a
party,
it
seem
there
is
no
way
it
could
seek
rate
reconsideration.
in
addition,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know.
i
assume
probably
mr.,
justice
because
it's
a
foreign
company
and
[voice
overlap]
and
there
was
some
problem
of
jurisdiction
i
supposed.
they
did
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
did
for
these
reasons.
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
didn't
conduct
the
suit,
perhaps
mr.
reed
can.
i
assume
that
was
the
reason
why
they
--
i
think
what
they
did
is
in
the
case
of
the
foreign
steamship
carriers;
they
named
these
parties
not
the
carriers
but
the
agents.
and
i
think
the
practice
probably
was
that
the
charges
were
assessed
not
against
the
carriers
but
as
against
their
agents.
now,
if
they
did
say
of
course
in
seeking
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
they
said
that
prior
to
seeking
reconsideration
before
the
commission
they
at
all
times
been
represented
by
counsel
for
their
agent
furness,
withy.
so
that
as
we
see
this
case
basically
on
this
aspect
of
it,
what
we
have
here
is
full
opportunity
and
complete
litigation
by
people
who
represented
the
respondent
before
the
federal
maritime
commission
on
a
proper
reference
from
the
district
court.
in
addition
to
that,
these
people
try
to
follow
the
statutory
procedure
for
judicial
review
by
filing
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit.
that
petition
unfortunately
was
untimely
and
was
properly
dismissed,
a
very
belated
effort
by
transatlantic
to
get
the
maritime
commission
to
reconsider
this
case.
these
people
filed
their
petition
for
reconsideration
with
the
federal
maritime
commission
six
months
after
this
court
had
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
obviously,
they
could
not
have
filed
petition
for
reconsideration
before
the
volkswagenwerk
case
but
the
commission
has
a
rule
that
except
for
good
course,
petitions
for
reconsideration
must
be
filed
within
30
days
and
certainly
it
was
incumbent
upon
this
people
if
they
wanted
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
decision
in
the
light
of
volkswagen
to
move
properly
not
to
wait
for
six
months.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
the
case
in
which
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
commission's
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
agreement
was
a
separate
agreement
that
required
prior
approval
of
whether
it
was
within
the
authority
conferred
by
the
original
agreement
as
the
maritime
commission
held
was
a
matter
that
was
not
open
to
the
district
court
when
it
came
to
consider
the
complaint
following
the
completion
of
the
maritime
proceedings
and
we
think
in
the
circumstances
that
the
first
circuit
had
no
warrant
in
itself
overturning
that
decision
reviewing
the
commission's
decision
de
novo
and
concluding
as
we
developed
in
our
brief
improperly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
end
of
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
we
refer
to
this
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
some
reason
apparently
concluded
that
the
transatlantic
was
not
a
proper
party.
it
was
not
represented
properly
before
the
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
find
mr.
justice
is
a
statement
at
page
51
where
he
said,
“we
must
hold
that
the
decision
did
not
bind
non-parties
to
charges
sought
to
be
imposed
for
services
rendered
prior
thereto.”
and
i
take
it
he
is
suggesting
that
transatlantic
was
not
bound
by
the
maritime
decision
because
it
was
not
a
party
to
the
maritime
commission
proceedings.
as
i
take
it
what
he
is
saying,
he
doesn't
explain
why
there
are
non-party
but
he
seems
just
to
assume
that
and
then
goes
on
say
they
are
not
bound.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no.
they
sought
review
of
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
untimely,
but
of
course
if
the
respondent
is
correct
in
his
interpretation
of
what
the
statute
means,
they
are
on
the
wrong
court.
they
should
have
been
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
opposed
on
this
one.
when
the
case
came
back
they
naturally
opposed
the
--
i
don't
know
all
of
the
details
but
transatlantic
basically
took
the
laboring
or
it
was
the
one
who
filed
an
answer
which
attacked
the
validity
of
the
maritime
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no,
that's
right.
it
did
not
go
into
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
never
went
there
on
time.
it
ultimately
went
into
the
district
court.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
here
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
an
amicus.
the
doctrine
of
primary
of
jurisdiction
that
this
court
announced
in
the
western
pacific
railway
case
in
352
united
states
comes
into
play
whenever
enforcement
of
a
claim
that
was
originally
cognizable
in
the
courts
requires
the
resolution
of
issues
which
under
a
regulatory
scheme
have
been
placed
within
the
special
competency
of
an
administrative
body.
we
think
without
question,
the
issues
raised
in
this
case
wore
those
kinds
--
that
kind
of
issue
and
were
properly
referred
to
the
federal
maritime
commission.
it
is
challenged.
the
respondent
challenges
that
and
said
there
was
no
need
for
the
reference.
the
issues
in
this
case
is
they
developed
in
the
district
court
with
the
most
technical
kind
of
issue
calling
for
specialized
knowledge
by
someone
familiar
with
the
intricacies
of
the
shipping
business
whether
or
not
when
this
particular
agreement
of
the
conference
of
the
terminal
was
approved
authorizing
them
to
fix
rates
and
charges,
whether
that
approval
carried
with
it
authorization
to
shift
the
incidence
of
a
particular
charge
of
a
cargo
kept
on
the
pier
after
five
days
when
during
the
period
of
a
longshoremen's
strike,
it
was
impossible
to
remove
that
cargo.
the
other
question
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
as
the
maritime
commission
held
that
this
change
was
not
a
new
agreement
that
required
approval
whether
the
practice
itself
was
illegal
in
violation
of
the
shipping
act.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
question
that
the
maritime
commission
has
to
decide
everyday.
and
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
or
not
what
was
done
in
this
case
constituted
proper
implementation
of
an
approved
agreement
or
a
new
agreement
or
modification
that
required
prior
commission
approval,
this
court
only
three
or
four
years
ago
held
in
the
carnation
case
that
that
was
specifically
an
issue
appropriate
for
resolution
by
the
maritime
commission.
so
we
think
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
judge
wyzanski
properly
ruled
that
this
was
a
matter
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
was
invoked.
the
commission
fully
heard
the
matter
and
the
commission
upheld
the
practices
and
the
actions
taken
by
the
group
of
terminals
in
the
port
of
boston.
and
then
the
question
comes
out,
how
is
that
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
rendered
on
this
reference
to
be
judicially
reviewed.
we
think
the
answer
that
flows
both
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
that
this
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
is
to
be
reviewed
the
same
way
as
any
other
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
by
filing
a
timely
and
proper
petition
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
the
referring
court
has
no
jurisdiction
collaterally
to
review
the
correctness
of
the
decision
of
this
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
basically
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
also
agreed
with
it,
that's
it.
under
our
analysis
there
is
no
need
to
reach
the
second
question
but
if
the
second
question
is
reached
as
we
developed
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
judge
wyzanski
correctly
upheld
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
the
starting
point
in
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
under
a
very
specific
statute
that
congress
say.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
i
would
have
to
disagree
when
you
say
in
a
referred
manner.
i
think
this
statute
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
referred
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
the
statute
mr.
justice
specifically
speaks
only
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
yes,
we
have
no
question
about
that.
the
congress
did
reversed
the
pennsylvania
case
but
we
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
and
it
may
well
be
that
as
a
matter
of
sound
policy
had
congress
consider
this
problem.
it
would
also
have
more
broadly
provided
for
reference
bound
for
review
by
the
referring
court
in
the
case
of
oil
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
mr.
justice
but
i
would
suggest
two
or
three
things
if
i
may
with
reference
to
the
statutory
provision.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
congressional
amendment
of
the
provision
for
review
of
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
seems
to
us
manifest
a
clear
congressional
intent
in
the
light
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case
that
unless
there
is
specific
language
providing
for
a
review
by
the
order
of
the
agency
in
the
referring
court
that
the
regular
practice
has
to
be
followed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
so
mr.
justice.
we
think
it's
a
sound
argument
and
let
me
though
put,
make
one
further
point
which
i
think
is
conclusive
on
this.
even
if
the
court
would
agree
with
the
respondent
on
that
point
that
doesn't
help
the
respondent
in
this
case
because
when
congress
amended
and
changed
the
procedures
for
a
review
of
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
whether
it
have
been
a
reference,
it
not
only
provided
that
the
referring
court
would
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
it
also
provided
that
any
such
proceeding
seeking
review
in
the
referral
court
would
have
to
be
filed
within
90
days
from
the
date
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
became
final.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
but
i
responded
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
governs
review
of
interstate
commerce
commission
orders,
there
is
no
time
limit
for
seeking
judicial
review.
unlike
most
of
the
review
provisions
there
is
no
time
limit
that
it
may
come
in
a
year
later
after
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order
and
seek
judicial
review.
but
under
this
provision,
under
section
1336
(c)
of
title
28,
it
says
explicitly
any
action
brought
on
to
subsection
(b)
which
provides
for
review
in
the
referring
court
shall
be
filed
with
a
90
days
from
the
date
that
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
becomes
final,
that
is
if
you
go
back
to
the
referring
court
following
a
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
a
reference
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
referring
court
within
90
days
after
the
order
of
the
commission
becomes
final.
and
that
was
clearly
not
done
in
this
case.
i
just
like
to
refer
briefly
to
some
of
the
dates
since
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
--
i
would
think
not
mr.
justice
in
that
type
of
an
order
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
of
the
basic
decision
that
consolo
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
then
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct?
[voice
overlap]
but
you
have
the
basic
policy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
the
carrier
itself
could
not
seek
review
at
all
under
the
decision
of
this
court.
the
carrier
--
only
the
shipper
could
seek
review
if
there
was
no
cease
and
desist
order.
only
the
shipper
could
seek
review
either
directly
or
the
carrier
could
defend
if
the
shipper
sought
enforcement.
but
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
then
the
carrier
can
seek
review.
but
i
thought
you'd
post
it
at
the
situation
where
there
is
only
a
reparation's
order.
as
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
in
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
review
orders,
because
i
think
mr.
justice
both
statutory
scheme
in
this
court
have
recognized
that
when
you're
dealing
with
reparation's
orders
you
have
a
very
special
situation.
congress
has
provided
[voice
overlap].
let
me
if
i
may
just
come
to
the
chronology
of
these
things
because
it's
very
clear
that
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
get
in
to
the
referring
court,
in
the
district
court
within
90
days
after
the
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
became
final.
however,
if
you
define
it,
the
decision
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
in
this
case
was
rendered
in
june
1967
and
transatlantic's
motion
to
intervene
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
april
1969,
so
that's
almost
two
years.
now,
let
us
assume
however,
that
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
did
not
become
final
until
the
court
of
appeals
had
dismissed
us
untimely;
the
petition
to
review
that
was
filed
by
the
conference.
in
that
event,
it
became
final
in
march
of
1968
and
again
more
than
a
year
it
lapse
before
they
went
back
into
the
district
court
to
seek
intervention.
now
let
us
look
at
the
case
from
the
most
favorable
point
of
view
as
far
as
the
respondent
is
concerned.
let
us
assume
that
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
did
not
become
final
until
the
maritime
commission
had
rejected
the
petition
for
reconsideration
and
let
us
further
assume
that
the
final
rejection
of
that
petition
for
reconsideration
was
not
the
letter
in
october
that
is
contained
in
the
record
but
the
subsequent
letter
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
in
our
brief
which
was
sent
out
in
december
2,
1968.
again,
more
than
four
months
elapsed,
more
than
120
days
between
the
receipt
of
that
letter
which
under
any
theory
closed
the
case
and
the
action
of
the
respondent
in
seeking
to
intervene
in
the
district
court.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
under
any
theory
even
assuming
it
would
be
appropriate
to
rely
on
the
policy
of
1336
(b)
to
say
that
we
will
apply
the
same
principles
to
review
of
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
as
we
do
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
still
don't
come
within
the
terms
of
that
because
this
was
not
filed
with
90
days
from
the
date
that
the
order
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
became
final.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
administrative
orders
review
act
case.
it
says
the
procedure
for
review
of
maritime
commission
order
is
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
but
in
1950
review
of
maritime
order
was
transferred
from
the
three-judge
district
courts
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
i
assume
the
procedure
is
basically
the
same.
that
is
the
same
consideration
of
finality
parties'
etcetera.
again,
it
has
come
back
to
say
that
congress
--
the
sole
problem
that
was
before
congress
when
it
amended
the
statute
was
the
problem
of
reference
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
interpret
a
statute
that
speaks
explicitly
of
referring
the
question
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
when
it
speaks
about
having
review
of
any
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
when
it
says
that
any
proceeding
to
review
on
the
referring
court
must
be
a
review
of
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
who
can
say,
interpret
that
in
saying
well,
the
congress
despite
of
this
very
specific
and
limited
language
must
have
meant
to
trade
the
maritime
commission
as
well
as
covered
by
this
section.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
refer
to
the
two
other
these
things
in
the
time
i
have.
one
relates
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
transatlantic
should
be
deemed
to
be
a
party
to
the
commission
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
in
refusing
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
maritime
commission
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
made
a
statement
that
non
parties
are
not
bound.
now,
it
would
appear
that
when
transatlantic
filed
its
petition
for
reconsideration
with
the
commission,
at
least
at
that
point
it
must
have
thought
itself
to
have
been
a
party
to
the
prior
commission
proceedings
because
under
the
commission's
rule
of
practice,
rule
16
(a)
which
we
set
forth
at
page
28
of
our
brief
that
provides
that
only
a
party
may
seek
reconsideration
and
if
transatlantic
was
not
a
party,
it
seem
there
is
no
way
it
could
seek
rate
reconsideration.
in
addition,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know.
i
assume
probably
mr.,
justice
because
it's
a
foreign
company
and
[voice
overlap]
and
there
was
some
problem
of
jurisdiction
i
supposed.
they
did
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
did
for
these
reasons.
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
didn't
conduct
the
suit,
perhaps
mr.
reed
can.
i
assume
that
was
the
reason
why
they
--
i
think
what
they
did
is
in
the
case
of
the
foreign
steamship
carriers;
they
named
these
parties
not
the
carriers
but
the
agents.
and
i
think
the
practice
probably
was
that
the
charges
were
assessed
not
against
the
carriers
but
as
against
their
agents.
now,
if
they
did
say
of
course
in
seeking
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
they
said
that
prior
to
seeking
reconsideration
before
the
commission
they
at
all
times
been
represented
by
counsel
for
their
agent
furness,
withy.
so
that
as
we
see
this
case
basically
on
this
aspect
of
it,
what
we
have
here
is
full
opportunity
and
complete
litigation
by
people
who
represented
the
respondent
before
the
federal
maritime
commission
on
a
proper
reference
from
the
district
court.
in
addition
to
that,
these
people
try
to
follow
the
statutory
procedure
for
judicial
review
by
filing
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit.
that
petition
unfortunately
was
untimely
and
was
properly
dismissed,
a
very
belated
effort
by
transatlantic
to
get
the
maritime
commission
to
reconsider
this
case.
these
people
filed
their
petition
for
reconsideration
with
the
federal
maritime
commission
six
months
after
this
court
had
decided
the
volkswagenwerk
case.
obviously,
they
could
not
have
filed
petition
for
reconsideration
before
the
volkswagenwerk
case
but
the
commission
has
a
rule
that
except
for
good
course,
petitions
for
reconsideration
must
be
filed
within
30
days
and
certainly
it
was
incumbent
upon
this
people
if
they
wanted
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
decision
in
the
light
of
volkswagen
to
move
properly
not
to
wait
for
six
months.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
the
case
in
which
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
commission's
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
agreement
was
a
separate
agreement
that
required
prior
approval
of
whether
it
was
within
the
authority
conferred
by
the
original
agreement
as
the
maritime
commission
held
was
a
matter
that
was
not
open
to
the
district
court
when
it
came
to
consider
the
complaint
following
the
completion
of
the
maritime
proceedings
and
we
think
in
the
circumstances
that
the
first
circuit
had
no
warrant
in
itself
overturning
that
decision
reviewing
the
commission's
decision
de
novo
and
concluding
as
we
developed
in
our
brief
improperly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
end
of
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
we
refer
to
this
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
some
reason
apparently
concluded
that
the
transatlantic
was
not
a
proper
party.
it
was
not
represented
properly
before
the
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
find
mr.
justice
is
a
statement
at
page
51
where
he
said,
“we
must
hold
that
the
decision
did
not
bind
non-parties
to
charges
sought
to
be
imposed
for
services
rendered
prior
thereto.”
and
i
take
it
he
is
suggesting
that
transatlantic
was
not
bound
by
the
maritime
decision
because
it
was
not
a
party
to
the
maritime
commission
proceedings.
as
i
take
it
what
he
is
saying,
he
doesn't
explain
why
there
are
non-party
but
he
seems
just
to
assume
that
and
then
goes
on
say
they
are
not
bound.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no.
they
sought
review
of
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
untimely,
but
of
course
if
the
respondent
is
correct
in
his
interpretation
of
what
the
statute
means,
they
are
on
the
wrong
court.
they
should
have
been
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
opposed
on
this
one.
when
the
case
came
back
they
naturally
opposed
the
--
i
don't
know
all
of
the
details
but
transatlantic
basically
took
the
laboring
or
it
was
the
one
who
filed
an
answer
which
attacked
the
validity
of
the
maritime
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
no,
that's
right.
it
did
not
go
into
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
never
went
there
on
time.
it
ultimately
went
into
the
district
court.
thank
you.
