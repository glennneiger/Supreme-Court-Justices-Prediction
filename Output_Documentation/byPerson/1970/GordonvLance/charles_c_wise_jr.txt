mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
voting,
an
election
case
that
of
course
does
determine
questions
of
whether
or
not
bonds
maybe
issued
or
excess
levies
applied,
but
it
also
equally
determines
whether
or
not
a
school
will
be
built
for
the
use
of
students
20
years
in
the
future
as
well
as
the
issue
of
paying
for
it.
there
is
certainly
no
requirement
to
our
knowledge
that
the
west
virginia
constitution
was
required
to
submit
to
the
voter
an
issue
such
as
this.
but
it
is
refreshing
that
it
does
do
so
on
such
an
important
matter,
education
and
having
done
so
it
seems
to
us
that
as
all
roads
once
led
to
rome,
the
well-established
pass
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
denial
of
the
vote
cases
and
in
the
waiting
and
debasement
and
dilution
cases
as
well
as
discrimination
of
subject
matter
as
found
in
hunter
versus
erickson
are
applicable
here
because
there
is
in
effect
no
doubt,
but
that
the
person
who
because
of
his
conviction
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
bond
shall
be
issued,
determined
whether
or
not
his
vote
is
to
be
counted
50%
more
than
that
of
another
of
opposite
conviction.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
the
line
will
have
to
be
drawn
somewhere
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
contend
that
elections
in
very
restricted
areas
or
dealing
with
restricted
issues
or
dealing
with
the
internal
procedures
of
a
legislature
or
something
of
that
kind
would
require
a
majority,
but
we
think
that
when
we
have
and
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
this
honorable
court
sir
ultimately
and
we
think
that
within
the
framework
of
those
decisions,
it
is
almost
inescapable
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
an
election
on
an
important
issue
on
a
county-wide
basis,
when
a
citizen
has
so
little
opportunity
now
of
direct
participation
in
an
important
result
that
their
may
be
more
reason
for
applying
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
this
than
in
the
election
of
a
representative
where
the
citizen's
interest
is
certainly
not
quite
as
direct
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
in
this
particular
area?
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mr.
justice
black
what
i
meant
was
that
where
the
line
is
drawn,
i
think
ultimately
will
rest
with
this
court.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
there
are
certain
areas
where
we
certainly
would
not
contend
that
the
majority
would
be
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
decision.
i
think
that
the
organization
of
the
legislature
for
example
or
in
connection
with
submitting
the
constitutional
amendment
certainly
would
not
come
within
what
we
understand
to
be
the
decisions
of
this
court
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
but
i
think
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
the
line
could
be
drawn
whereby
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
within
that
line.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
ultimately
it
would
rest
with
this
court
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it
would
determine
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
apply
and
permit
it.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
believe
that
would
be
a
proper
restriction.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes,
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
voter
turnout
under
these
conditions
in
a
special
election.
but
i
would
guess
that
if
the
law
were
fixed
on
that
basis,
it
would
be
much
easier
to
get
a
better
turnout
and
perhaps
these
special
issues
would
be
submitted
in
the
general
election
where
normally
there
are
more
voters
participating.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
that
might
be
reasonable
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
a
grave
error
policy
to
make
that
type
of
requirement
because
we
have
had
a
constitution
for
98
years
with
practically
no
change
and
efforts
to
amend
it.
i
have
met
with
a
very
frustrating
experience
both
legislatively
at
the
hands
of
the
voters
and
i
think
that's
rather
typical.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
they
weren't
legislatively
frustrated.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
of
course
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
lucas
case
against
the
general
assembly
of
colorado,
the
mere
fact
that
there
has
been
approval
by
the
voters
of
an
apportionment
prior
does
not
in
any
ways
take
the
proposal
away
from
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
we
think
also
that
the
hunter
against
erickson
case
where
there
was
a
very
sophisticated
method
employed
in
depriving
certain
interested
groups
of
an
opportunity
to
get
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
akron,
ohio,
dealing
with
local
housing.
that
that
is
equally
applicable
here
because
those
who
are
in
favor
of
a
proposal
of
the
kind
voted
on
in
this
case
are
certainly
disadvantaged
by
reason
of
the
60%
requirement
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
well
reasoned
opinion
as
we
say
in
california
and
also
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
which
took
the
invitation
of
this
court
in
the
maryland
case,
(inaudible)
against
maryland
of
attempting
to
apply
what
it
understood
to
be
the
rules
of
this
court
to
that
situation.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir,
we
have
no
initiative,
and
it
requires
a
two-thirds
of
concurring
vote
of
both
houses
of
the
legislation.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
do
submit,
no
sir.
we
do
have
a
provision
for
calling
a
constitutional
convention
which
has
not
been
done
for
98-years
when
the
1972
constitution
was
involved,
but
basically
your
honors,
it
is
our
position
and
we
think
it
goes
back
even
beyond
gray.
mr.
justice
black
in
colgrove
against
green
in
1946
in
a
dissenting
opinion
pointed
out
that
no
one
would
argue
that
if
you
gave
the
one
voter
one-half
of
the
weight
given
to
another
voter,
you
would
have
an
invalid
situation.
gray
certainly
makes
that
clear
and
as
we
see
at
all
of
the
equality
cases
go
to
the
point
that
the
same
weight
substantially
must
be
given
to
the
view
of
each
one.
the
most
invidious
discrimination
of
all
as
we
conceive
it
is
a
discrimination
based
upon
the
view
of
the
outcome
of
an
issue
that
a
voter
may
have.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it's
substantial.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
us
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
most
the
state
can
do
is
give
the
opportunity
to
vote
and
if
it
gives
that
opportunity
it
ought
not
dilute
the
diets
(ph)
it
ought
to
be
fair.
it
should
not
weigh
one
man's
vote
greater
than
another.
now,
it's
true
that
in
(inaudible)
many
factors
may
keep
a
voter
away
which
would
influence
the
outcome.
we
of
course
don't
know
how
the
absent
voter
would
vote
on
a
particular
issue,
did
he
come
to
the
polls
and
participate?
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
but
philosophically
i
would
suppose
mr.
chief
justice
that,
that
goes
back
to
a
part
of
the
great
compromise,
a
part
of
the
traditions
of
our
form
of
government
and
in
final
analysis
there
seem
to
be
exception
to
do
--
to
most
rules
somewhere
along
the
line.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
it's
philosophical.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir.
i
would
certainly
concede
that
on
philosophic
ground.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mathematically
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
believe
it's
fourth-fifths.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
two-thirds
to
fourth-fifths.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
line
properly
doesn't
extend
to
matters
involving
this
balance
between
the
tripartite
type
functions
of
government.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
do
not
think
there
is
complete
consistency
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it's
never
been
held
to.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
basis
of
law
of
giving
effect
to
all.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
would
be
true
for
that
particular
session,
yes
but
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
we
couldn't.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it
is
the
same
subject
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
but
it
comes
about
it
seems
to
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
dealing
with
the
effect
of
legislative
appropriation
and
the
fact
that
in
our
checks
and
balance
system
of
government,
we
give
to
the
executive
an
opportunity
to
veto.
now,
whether
it
is
wise
i
don't
know,
but
as
far
as
we're
aware
that
has
not
been
the
subject
matter
of
a
decision
here
and
a
determination
that
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
we
think
sir
that
both
are
bad
but
we
aren't
sure
that
the
other
one
is
subject
to
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
certainly,
the
court
will
not
be
called
upon
at
any
time
to
go
100%
by
saying
that
majority
rule
shall
control
every
aspect
of
life.
we
believe
that
majority
rule
as
a
rule
is
really
involved
here
except
in
the
sense
that
the
result
of
applying
to
each
voter
equal
weight
in
his
vote
does
result
of
course
in
a
--
and
that
there
must
be
a
majority
to
carry
a
preposition,
a
majority
of
those
fully.
but
that
as
we
understand
it
doesn't
evolve
the
application
on
even
theoretical
grounds
of
going
to
the
point
of
destroying
the
traditional
balance
of
power
between
the
three
branches
of
the
government
and
that
would
be
the
last
thing
that
we
would
urge
here.
but
we
do
say
that
under
the
gray
against
sanders
and
all
of
the
cases
that
follow
it,
those
that
deal
with
local
issues
as
being
subject
to
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
like
avery
against
midland,
the
cases
that
have
recently
been
decided
in
1969
and
1970
such
as
cramer
and
cipriano
and
phoenix
which
go
through
a
question
of
the
issuance
of
bonds
and
the
requirement
for
example
in
cipriano
that
it
is
impermissible
for
louisiana
to
require
by
legislation
a
50%
vote
and
a
50%
in
amount
result
to
uphold.
and
in
the
case
of
phoenix
as
well
as
cipriano
of
course
the
court
vary
properly
pointed
out
that
you
cannot
make
the
voting
classification
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
you
are
a
real
property
taxpayer.
well,
in
our
view
carrington
against
rash,
the
erickson
decision
make
it
even
more
invidious
if
the
discrimination
is
based
upon
the
views
that
a
man
hold
as
to
the
outcome
of
an
election.
having
granted
him
a
right
to
come
in
to
participate
in
an
important
issue,
he
should
have
the
right
to
have
his
vote
counted
equally
with
that
of
the
man
who
is
convinced
that
an
opposite
result
should
come
about.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
is
perfectly
true,
but
i
think
we
are
going
to
have
to
risk
that
and
encourage
them
to
get
out
and
vote
their
conviction.
philosophically
there
is
an
inconsistency
there
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
would
recognize
of
course.
we
also
submit
that
if
it
is
applicable
here
mr.
justice
white
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
that
would
preclude
or
make
it
proper
to
permit
this
provision
to
stand.
section
8
of
article
10
of
our
constitution,
another
section
of
the
very
article
that
is
involved
here
has
an
absolute
limit
on
bonded
indebtedness
and
on
excess
levies.
in
no
event,
even
with
the
60%
votes
in
successive
elections
and
for
a
period
of
time
can
you
go
beyond
5%
of
the
assessed
valuation.
of
course
that
constitutes
the
best
way
to
prevent
extravagant
government.
as
was
pointed
out
early
in
connection
with
our
provision
of
the
constitution
involved
here,
the
hope
was
expressed
that
this
would
have
something
to
do
with
preventing
that
(inaudible).
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
30
odd
states
that
have
no
such
provision
in
their
constitutions
or
laws
seem
to
be
able
to
be
just
as
economical
and
handle
these
matter
just
as
effectively
as
the
16
or
17
which
clearly
do
contain
provisions
of
this
kind
either
in
their
organic
law
or
in
their
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
has
been
a
great
body
of
sophisticated
knowledge
respecting
bond
issues
and
taxes
that
has
grown
up
in
recent
years,
the
rating
services
and
matters
of
that
kind
which
go
––
do
much
better
job
that
respective
legislative
or
constitutional
provisions
do
in
attempting
to
prevent
the
local
governmental
bodies
from
going
overboard
and
making
extravagant
expenditures.
on
that
basis,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
correctly
decided
this
issue
as
did
california.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
voting,
an
election
case
that
of
course
does
determine
questions
of
whether
or
not
bonds
maybe
issued
or
excess
levies
applied,
but
it
also
equally
determines
whether
or
not
a
school
will
be
built
for
the
use
of
students
20
years
in
the
future
as
well
as
the
issue
of
paying
for
it.
there
is
certainly
no
requirement
to
our
knowledge
that
the
west
virginia
constitution
was
required
to
submit
to
the
voter
an
issue
such
as
this.
but
it
is
refreshing
that
it
does
do
so
on
such
an
important
matter,
education
and
having
done
so
it
seems
to
us
that
as
all
roads
once
led
to
rome,
the
well-established
pass
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
denial
of
the
vote
cases
and
in
the
waiting
and
debasement
and
dilution
cases
as
well
as
discrimination
of
subject
matter
as
found
in
hunter
versus
erickson
are
applicable
here
because
there
is
in
effect
no
doubt,
but
that
the
person
who
because
of
his
conviction
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
bond
shall
be
issued,
determined
whether
or
not
his
vote
is
to
be
counted
50%
more
than
that
of
another
of
opposite
conviction.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
the
line
will
have
to
be
drawn
somewhere
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
contend
that
elections
in
very
restricted
areas
or
dealing
with
restricted
issues
or
dealing
with
the
internal
procedures
of
a
legislature
or
something
of
that
kind
would
require
a
majority,
but
we
think
that
when
we
have
and
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
this
honorable
court
sir
ultimately
and
we
think
that
within
the
framework
of
those
decisions,
it
is
almost

that
when

of

that
their

be
more

for
applying
the
fourteenth

to
this
than
in
the
election
of
a
representative
where
the
citizen's
interest
is
certainly
not
quite
as
direct
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
in
this
particular
area?
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mr.
justice
black
what
i
meant
was
that
where
the
line
is
drawn,
i
think
ultimately
will
rest
with
this
court.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
there
are
certain
areas
where
we
certainly
would
not
contend
that
the
majority
would
be
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
decision.
i
think
that
the
organization
of
the
legislature
for
example
or
in
connection
with
submitting
the
constitutional
amendment
certainly
would
not
come
within
what
we
understand
to
be
the
decisions
of
this
court
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
but
i
think
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
the
line
could
be
drawn
whereby
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
within
that
line.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
ultimately
it
would
rest
with
this
court
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it
would
determine
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
apply
and
permit
it.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
believe
that
would
be
a
proper
restriction.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes,
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
voter
turnout
under
these
conditions
in
a
special
election.
but
i
would
guess
that
if
the
law
were
fixed
on
that
basis,
it
would
be
much
easier
to
get
a
better
turnout
and
perhaps
these
special
issues
would
be
submitted
in
the
general
election
where
normally
there
are
more
voters
participating.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
that
might
be
reasonable
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
a
grave
error
policy
to
make
that
type
of
requirement
because
we
have
had
a
constitution
for
98
years
with
practically
no
change
and
efforts
to
amend
it.
i
have
met
with
a
very
frustrating
experience
both
legislatively
at
the
hands
of
the
voters
and
i
think
that's
rather
typical.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
they
weren't
legislatively
frustrated.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
of
course
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
lucas
case
against
the
general
assembly
of
colorado,
the
mere
fact
that
there
has
been
approval
by
the
voters
of
an
apportionment
prior
does
not
in
any
ways
take
the
proposal
away
from
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
we
think
also
that
the
hunter
against
erickson
case
where
there
was
a
very
sophisticated
method
employed
in
depriving
certain
interested
groups
of
an
opportunity
to
get
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
akron,
ohio,
dealing
with
local
housing.
that
that
is
equally
applicable
here
because
those
who
are
in
favor
of
a
proposal
of
the
kind
voted
on
in
this
case
are
certainly
disadvantaged
by
reason
of
the
60%
requirement
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
well
reasoned
opinion
as
we
say
in
california
and
also
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
which
took
the
invitation
of
this
court
in
the
maryland
case,
(inaudible)
against
maryland
of
attempting
to
apply
what
it
understood
to
be
the
rules
of
this
court
to
that
situation.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir,
we
have
no
initiative,
and
it
requires
a
two-thirds
of
concurring
vote
of
both
houses
of
the
legislation.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
do
submit,
no
sir.
we
do
have
a
provision
for
calling
a
constitutional
convention
which
has
not
been
done
for
98-years
when
the
1972
constitution
was
involved,
but
basically
your
honors,
it
is
our
position
and
we
think
it
goes
back
even
beyond
gray.
mr.
justice
black
in
colgrove
against
green
in
1946
in
a
dissenting
opinion
pointed
out
that
no
one
would
argue
that
if
you
gave
the
one
voter
one-half
of
the
weight
given
to
another
voter,
you
would
have
an
invalid
situation.
gray
certainly
makes
that
clear
and
as
we
see
at
all
of
the
equality
cases
go
to
the
point
that
the
same
weight
substantially
must
be
given
to
the
view
of
each
one.
the
most
invidious
discrimination
of
all
as
we
conceive
it
is
a
discrimination
based
upon
the
view
of
the
outcome
of
an
issue
that
a
voter
may
have.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it's
substantial.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
us
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
most
the
state
can
do
is
give
the
opportunity
to
vote
and
if
it
gives
that
opportunity
it
ought
not
dilute
the
diets
(ph)
it
ought
to
be
fair.
it
should
not
weigh
one
man's
vote
greater
than
another.
now,
it's
true
that
in
(inaudible)
many
factors
may
keep
a
voter
away
which
would
influence
the
outcome.
we
of
course
don't
know
how
the
absent
voter
would
vote
on
a
particular
issue,
did
he
come
to
the
polls
and
participate?
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
but
philosophically
i
would
suppose
mr.
chief
justice
that,
that
goes
back
to
a
part
of
the
great
compromise,
a
part
of
the
traditions
of
our
form
of
government
and
in
final
analysis
there
seem
to
be
exception
to
do
--
to
most
rules
somewhere
along
the
line.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
it's
philosophical.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir.
i
would
certainly
concede
that
on
philosophic
ground.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
mathematically
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
believe
it's
fourth-fifths.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
two-thirds
to
fourth-fifths.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
line
properly
doesn't
extend
to
matters
involving
this
balance
between
the
tripartite
type
functions
of
government.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
i
do
not
think
there
is
complete
consistency
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it's
never
been
held
to.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
basis
of
law
of
giving
effect
to
all.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
would
be
true
for
that
particular
session,
yes
but
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
we
couldn't.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
it
is
the
same
subject
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
but
it
comes
about
it
seems
to
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
dealing
with
the
effect
of
legislative
appropriation
and
the
fact
that
in
our
checks
and
balance
system
of
government,
we
give
to
the
executive
an
opportunity
to
veto.
now,
whether
it
is
wise
i
don't
know,
but
as
far
as
we're
aware
that
has
not
been
the
subject
matter
of
a
decision
here
and
a
determination
that
--
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
we
think
sir
that
both
are
bad
but
we
aren't
sure
that
the
other
one
is
subject
to
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
certainly,
the
court
will
not
be
called
upon
at
any
time
to
go
100%
by
saying
that
majority
rule
shall
control
every
aspect
of
life.
we
believe
that
majority
rule
as
a
rule
is
really
involved
here
except
in
the
sense
that
the
result
of
applying
to
each
voter
equal
weight
in
his
vote
does
result
of
course
in
a
--
and
that
there
must
be
a
majority
to
carry
a
preposition,
a
majority
of
those
fully.
but
that
as
we
understand
it
doesn't
evolve
the
application
on
even
theoretical
grounds
of
going
to
the
point
of
destroying
the
traditional
balance
of
power
between
the
three
branches
of
the
government
and
that
would
be
the
last
thing
that
we
would
urge
here.
but
we
do
say
that
under
the
gray
against
sanders
and
all
of
the
cases
that
follow
it,
those
that
deal
with
local
issues
as
being
subject
to
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
like
avery
against
midland,
the
cases
that
have
recently
been
decided
in
1969
and
1970
such
as
cramer
and
cipriano
and
phoenix
which
go
through
a
question
of
the
issuance
of
bonds
and
the
requirement
for
example
in
cipriano
that
it
is
impermissible
for
louisiana
to
require
by
legislation
a
50%
vote
and
a
50%
in
amount
result
to
uphold.
and
in
the
case
of
phoenix
as
well
as
cipriano
of
course
the
court
vary
properly
pointed
out
that
you
cannot
make
the
voting
classification
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
you
are
a
real
property
taxpayer.
well,
in
our
view
carrington
against
rash,
the
erickson
decision
make
it
even
more
invidious
if
the
discrimination
is
based
upon
the
views
that
a
man
hold
as
to
the
outcome
of
an
election.
having
granted
him
a
right
to
come
in
to
participate
in
an
important
issue,
he
should
have
the
right
to
have
his
vote
counted
equally
with
that
of
the
man
who
is
convinced
that
an
opposite
result
should
come
about.
mr.
charles
c.
wise,
jr.
that
is
perfectly
true,
but
i
think
we
are
going
to
have
to
risk
that
and
encourage
them
to
get
out
and
vote
their
conviction.
philosophically
there
is
an
inconsistency
there
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
would
recognize
of
course.
we
also
submit
that
if
it
is
applicable
here
mr.
justice
white
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
that
would
preclude
or
make
it
proper
to
permit
this
provision
to
stand.
section
8
of
article
10
of
our
constitution,
another
section
of
the
very
article
that
is
involved
here
has
an
absolute
limit
on
bonded
indebtedness
and
on
excess
levies.
in
no
event,
even
with
the
60%
votes
in
successive
elections
and
for
a
period
of
time
can
you
go
beyond
5%
of
the
assessed
valuation.
of
course
that
constitutes
the
best
way
to
prevent
extravagant
government.
as
was
pointed
out
early
in
connection
with
our
provision
of
the
constitution
involved
here,
the
hope
was
expressed
that
this
would
have
something
to
do
with
preventing
that
(inaudible).
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
30
odd
states
that
have
no
such
provision
in
their
constitutions
or
laws
seem
to
be
able
to
be
just
as
economical
and
handle
these
matter
just
as
effectively
as
the
16
or
17
which
clearly
do
contain
provisions
of
this
kind
either
in
their
organic
law
or
in
their
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
has
been
a
great
body
of
sophisticated
knowledge
respecting
bond
issues
and
taxes
that
has
grown
up
in
recent
years,
the
rating
services
and
matters
of
that
kind
which
go
––
do
much
better
job
that
respective
legislative
or
constitutional
provisions
do
in
attempting
to
prevent
the
local
governmental
bodies
from
going
overboard
and
making
extravagant
expenditures.
on
that
basis,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
correctly
decided
this
issue
as
did
california.
