mr.

you
may
precede
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
constitution
of
west
virginia
be
changed
by
a
simple
majority
vote?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
by
any
chance
show
what
the
vote
in
fact
was?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
counsel
if
this
were
mathematical
problem
essentially,
it
could
be
reasonably
argued
that
on
the
respondent's
theory,
one-third
of
the
registered
voters
are
committing
the
credit
of
all
the
registered
voters,
there
were
about
28
to
2,900
for
the
bond
issue,
were
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
on
that
argument,
if
it's
mathematics,
the
third
or
normally
the
third
of
the
people
are
committing
8,900
people,
2,800
of
people,
8,900
people?
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
scott
in
overriding
a
presidential
veto
in
houses
of
the
congress
under
the
federal
constitution,
negative
votes
have
twice
the
voting
value
as
affirmative
votes,
don't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
take
justice
white's
illustration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
each
case,
the
parallel
to
the
veto
power
overriding
the
veto
of
the
president
in
each
case,
west
virginia's
constitution
and
the
federal
constitution,
it's
a
matter
of
the
organic
law
which
the
people
have
adopted,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
term
of
this
bond
issue
--
what
was
the
term
of
the
bond
issue,
when
will
they
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
there's
great
many
people
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
great
many
people
who
couldn't
vote
on
this
bond
issue
where
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
off
the
bonded
indebtedness,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
scott.
mr.
wise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
would
draw
the
line,
who
would
draw
that
line?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
line
for
the
west
virginia
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
requirement
in
the
west
virginia
constitution
that
50%
plus
one
a
majority
of
all
the
registered
voters
would
be
required
to
contract
bond
indebtedness?
do
you
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
require
4,500
votes
in
round
figures
here,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
far
more
difficult
to
obtain
that
kind
of
a
majority
than
60%
of
the
voters
actually
voting,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
how
do
you
--
did
i
understand
mr.
scott
to
say
that
the
legislature
did
by
a
two-thirds
vote
adopt
constitutional
amendment
and
then
the
people
rejected
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
how
were
they
legislatively
frustrated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
just
frustrated
themselves?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
you
to
concede
that
constitutionally
west
virginia
could
require
a
majority
of
all
registered
voters
in
response
to
questions
of
justice
white
and
of
myself.
now,
if
you
have
that,
what
is
the
mathematical
impact
of
the
people
who
stay
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
more
than
that?
isn't
discriminatory
if
we
follow
your
thesis
of
rigid
mathematics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
isn't
the
federal
constitutional
provision
requiring
two-thirds
vote
to
override
a
presidential
veto
“unconstitutional
discrimination?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
had
understood
all
of
your
argument,
the
main
thrust
of
your
argument
was
philosophical
here
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
the
difference
between
the
fourteenth
amendment
being
binding
on
the
states
and
not
the
federal
government
doesn't
help
you
very
much?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
discriminatory
in
effect
and
philosophically
discriminatory
to
require
two-thirds
veto
overrides
the
president.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
intentionally
discriminatory,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
find
that
difficult
to
follow
mr.
wise
and
blatantly
preposition
that
you
and
i
seem
to
agree
on
with
reference
to
50%,
a
majority
of
all
registered
voters
being
required
because
then
a
man
who
stayed
home
might
have
a
vote
which
would
--
a
non-vote
which
would
carry
more
weight
than
a
man
who
took
the
trouble
to
go
down
to
the
polls
and
vote.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wise.
mr.
scott,
you
have
about
five
minutes
left.
chief
