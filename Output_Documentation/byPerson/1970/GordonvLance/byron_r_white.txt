r.
white
could
you
tell
me
or
does
the
record
show
what
percentage
of
eligible
voters
actually
voted
in
this
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
know
what
your
normal
turnout
is
--
was
this
a
general
election
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
an
excellent
turn
out
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
unusual
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
your
turnout
is
in
the
general
election
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
(inaudible)
other
way
that
it
only
took
a
30%
vote
in
favor
to
pass
the
bond
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there's
no
majority
rule
either
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutional
provisions
to
protect
minority?
justice
byron
r.
white
handful
of
constitutional
provisions
to
protect
minority?
justice
byron
r.
white
here,
here
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
here
you
say
that
in
order
to
impose
a
tax
levy,
or
to
impose
bond
indebtedness
it
takes
60%
of
the
vote,
but
on
other
issues
it
takes
50%?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
constitutional
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
law
--
what
west
virginia
law
was
that
negative
votes
shall
be
counted
twice
and
affirmative
votes
counted
once
on
bond
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it'd
give
exactly
the
same
result,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
well
i
mean
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
law
could
say
that
in
all
of
political
subdivisions
passing
bond
issues
or
submitting
bond
issues,
negative
votes
will
be
counted
once-and-a-half
and
affirmative
votes
counted
once,
you
have
precisely
the
same
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
the
same
argument
though
there
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
my
example,
he
has
the
same
power
when
he
goes
in
to
because
he
doesn't
know
which
side
he
is
going
to
be
on
until
the
vote
is
counted?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
make
--
any
issue
--
any
difference,
what
issue
the
provision
applied
to,
but
just
across
the
board
the
state
did
require
a
super
majority
to
pass
anything
and
it's
not
a
question
that
the
state
justify
it
at
all,
it's
just
a
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
discrimination
and
the
issue
got
down
to
whether
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
state
may
discriminate
given
a
good
enough
reason.
are
those
reasons
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do
want
us
to
get
that
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
you
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
are
in
your
brief,
the
ones
the
state
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you've
lost
the
case
do
you
just
--
if
the
court
thought
there
was
a
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
constitution
--
the
approval
of
constitutional
amendments
would
require
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
be
on
constitutional
requirement
that's
presented?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
do
i
understand
that
the
law
says
51%
of
all
the
eligible
voters,
you
would
think
that
would
be
something
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
constitution
is
important
to
go
on
without
the
actual
vote
and
claim
that
via
majority?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
majority
of
the
voters
in
the
west
virginia
could
change
the
constitution
of
west
virginia
to
say
that
all
bond
issues
shall
be
approved
if
they
are
approved
by
a
majority,
the
voters
actually
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
initiative
in
west
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
don't
challenge?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause
subsumes
equal
protection,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
how
does
the
--
how
can
the
fifth
amendment
with
an
equal
protection
clause
implied
into
it,
be
squared
with
the
provisions
of
the
main
body
of
the
constitution
requiring
simple
majorities
in
some
instances?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
fifth
amendment
then
modify
the
main
provision,
it
has
never
been
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
you
can
say
that
it
is
consistent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection
in
the
constitution's
equal
majority
requirements,
i
mean,
just
on
the
constitutional
principle?
