mr.
george
m.
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
first
to
apologize
for
my
voice,
i've
had
laryngitis
the
last
few
days,
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
case
is
unique
i
think
in
the
annals
of
jurisprudence.
the
question
presented
has
never
before
been
presented
to
this
court.
the
question,
does
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
fourteenth
amendment
mean
majority
rule
in
special
elections
to
determine
questions
of
public
policy?
put
it
in
another
way,
does
the
60%
requirement,
the
extraordinary
majority
requirement
of
the
constitution
and
enabling
statutes
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution?
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute,
they're
simple
and
they're
brief.
in
my
home
county,
roane
county
in
west
virginia
on
april
1968,
the
board
of
education
submitted
to
the
people
for
decision,
two
issues.
the
first
question
was
whether
or
not
to
issue
of
a
$1,800,000.00
in
general
obligation
bond.
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
to
increase
the
rate
of
taxation
for
current
expenditures
beyond
the
constitutionally
prescribed
maximum
for
a
period
of
five
years.
on
each
of
these
issues,
approximately
51.51%
of
the
persons
voting,
voted
in
the
affirmative
and
of
course
the
issues
failed
the
passage
to
canvas
by
the
board
of
education
because
of
the
requisite
60%
of
the
voters
did
not
approve
the
issue.
constitution
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
was
adopted
in
1872.
at
that
time
the
60%
requirement
so
far
as
bond
indebtedness
or
any
indebtedness
extending
beyond
the
current
fiscal
year
was
part
of
the
constitution.
in
1932,
the
tax
limitation
amendment
was
adopted
which
set
forth
maximum
tax
rates
for
each
political
subdivision
and
this
limitation
amendment
provide
that
these
rates
could
not
be
exceeded
except
by
vote
of
the
people
and
60%
voting
in
the
affirmative.
in
1966,
an
amendment
was
presented
to
the
people
of
west
virginia
and
the
only
question
in
that
amendment
was
whether
or
not
to
amend
and
cancel
the
60%
requirement
and
substitute
a
simple
majority
requirement
and
the
people
voted
by
a
majority
to
retain
the
60%
rule.
despite
this
background
--
in
light
of
this
background,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
decided
at
the
instance
of
five
citizens
of
our
county,
allegedly
voted
in
the
affirmative
on
each
of
these
issues,
that
the
60%
requirement,
the
extraordinary
majority
requirement
was
inherently
discriminatory
in
that
it
diluted
or
debased
the
vote
of
the
persons
who
voted
yes
as
compared
to
the
vote
of
the
persons
who
voted
no.
these
issues
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
when
it's
submitted.
it's
submitted
at
the
instance
of
the
two-thirds
vote
of
each
house
of
the
legislature,
but
on
the
vote
of
the
people,
it
is
a
majority
vote
when
submitted
to
the
electorate
at
large.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
am
not
certain
your
honor,
i
think
the
dissent
of
judge
haymond
does
show
that.
mr.
george
m.
scott
1966,
your
honor.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
right.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
tax
limitation
amendment
dates
back
to
1932,
that's
the
levy.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yeah,
limiting
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
the
levy
rates.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
dates
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
1932,
the
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
bonding
of
the
–
our
political
subdivisions
have
always
been
prohibited
from
borrowing
money
except
by
approval
of
two-thirds
of
the
persons
voting
on
the
question
of
borrowing
money.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
my
understanding,
this
is
from
the
1872
constitution,
our
constitution
as
one
of
the
older
ones
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
we
think
that
this
--
and
of
course,
this
case
doesn't
present,
a
situation
earlier
was
--
a
discrimination
based
upon
race
or
religion
or
wealth
or
place
of
residence
or
marital
status
or
any
circumstance
that
prevailed
in
any
of
the
so-called
one
man,
one
vote
cases.
there
is
i
think
no
factual
analogy
between
those
cases
and
this
case,
and
yet
our
court
felt
obliged
by
virtue
of
the
language
in
the
opinions
of
those
cases,
to
hold
that
this
60%
requirement
was
inherently
discriminatory.
we
think
and
its
our
submission
that
this
is
a
monstrous
misapplication
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
and
to
support
this
submission,
i
have
cited
to
the
court
in
my
brief,
articles
which
have
appeared
in
virginia
law
review
and
georgetown
law
review.
i
have
also
cited
articles
which
have
appeared
in
the
harvard
law
review,
the
columbia
law
review,
houston
law
review,
vanderbilt
law
review,
the
west
virginia
law
review
and
there
are
others
and
the
commentators
are
severely
critical
of
this
decision,
i
think
without
exception.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
it's
certainly
beyond
dispute
mr.
justice
harlan
that
60
does
not
equal
40
and
this
is
i
think
the
basic
error
that
the
court
fell
into.
they
treated
this
as
a
problem
of
arithmetic
rather
than
a
problem
of
definition
or
one
of
philosophy.
i
think
that
–-
and
they
reached
this
profound
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
60
is
to
40
is
one-one-half
is
to
one,
but
the
rules
of
arithmetic
i
think
must
lead
to
an
absurd
result
because
if
you
say,
speaking
mathematically,
that
this
provision
is
inherently
discriminatory
then
mathematically
speaking
you
have
to
say
that
a
majority
rule
is
likewise
discriminatory
and
majority
as
to
minority
as
more
is
to
less
and
inherently
unequal,
so
the
rules
of
mathematics
i
think
can't
be
used.
mr.
george
m.
scott
only
on
the
basis
of
comparison
i
think
in
a
geographical
sense
and
also
in
a
all
together
a
different
context
where
the
–-
so
many
more
people
have
the
right
to
elect
only
one
delegate
as
opposed
fewer
people
in
another
area.
so
mathematics
does
have
a
play
there,
but
not
in
the
sense
that
i
want
to
present
here,
but
it
is
the
sense
of
equality.
it
doesn't
have
to
–-
one
doesn't
have
to
equal
one
before
there
can
be
constitutional
equality
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
george
m.
scott
ignored
it.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
court
said
that
the
federal
analogy
was
frivolous
and
wholly
beside
the
point.
i
want
to
get
to
that
a
little
later
too.
i
do
not
think
that
it's
frivolous
and
wholly
beside
the
point.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
record
did
not
show
that,
i
can
tell
you.
i
have
an
agreement
of
the
counsel
here.
there
were
8,911
registered
voters
in
roane
county
at
the
time
of
this
election.
the
record
does
show
how
many
persons
voted.
there
was
something
--
approximately
5,700
people
voted.so
approximately,
60%
of
the
actual
voters
voted.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
was
not
a
general
election.
this
was
a
special
election.
they
had
excellent
turnout,
i
think.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
the
60%
turnout
is
an
excellent
turnout.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
rural
area
in
the
spring,
when
the
roads
are
bad
and
these
are
generally
scheduled
i
might
add
mr.
justice
white
so
there
won't
be
too
heavy
turnout.
mr.
george
m.
scott
no,
i'm
certain.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
is
a
strictly
guess
mr.
justice
white
but
i
would
say
roughly
75%.
we
have
in
politically
minor
county.
so,
as
i've
said
in
an
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
not
a
mathematical
problem,
it's
a
philosophical
problem
and
of
course
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
2,800,
yes.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
would
say
the
same
thing,
i
think
it's
valid.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
not.
we're
getting
here
i
think
with
the
situation,
the
minority
veto,
of
course
our
constitution
and
our
history
is
full
of
instances
of
minority
veto
and
not
necessarily
the
minority
rule
where
we're
getting
in
situation
where
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
m.
scott
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
before
this
decision
i
thought
that's
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
all
about.
there's
one
thing
that
i
think
is
prevalent
here,
the
essence
i
think
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
voting
situation
is
that
everybody
should
have
the
equality
of
voting
power,
and
i
believe
that
the
court
below
more
or
less
conceded,
the
california
court
and
it's
a
scholarly
decision,
a
62-page
decision,
i
think
did
concede,
and
i
believe
that
my
adversary
here,
i
think
we
will
all
have
to
admit
that
whenever
–-
and
in
situation
like
this,
when
any
man
enters
the
voting
booth,
when
all
the
voters
first
go
to
the
poll,
before
the
election
is
held,
each
has
exactly
the
same
opportunity,
each
has
exactly
the
same
power
to
affect
the
ultimate
decision
as
every
other
voter.
regardless
of
how
he
votes,
he's
got
the
same
power
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election
when
he
goes
in.
this
wasn't
the
case
in
any
of
the
one
man
one
vote
cases
and
those
cases
seems
to
me
the
state
had
told
these
people,
regardless
of
how
you
vote,
your
vote
as
a
resident
of
this
populous
county
can
have
as
much
effect
on
the
ultimate
decision
making
process
as
the
vote
of
the
man
who
lives
in
the
less
populous
rural
area.
but
here,
the
state
has
told
the
people
you
each
have
equal
voice,
you
each
have
the
equal
power
to
affect
the
outcome.
the
extraordinary
majority
requirement
is
merely
a
rule
of
decision.
it
prescribes
how
many
votes
it
takes
to
win,
in
other
plurality
not
a
majority
but
a
60%
of
the
votes
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
that'd
be
monstrous,
i
think
that'd
be
monstrous
and
of
course
plain
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
the
candidates
are
individuals,
their
people
and
are
subjected
to
discrimination,
they
couldn't
be
treated
unequally
on
such
measure.
mr.
george
m.
scott
and
affirmative
than
a
negative,
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
on
affirmative
bond
issue
or
negative
bond
issue
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
is
not
a
person
subject
to
discrimination.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
constitutional
amendment
is
one
certainly.
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
constitution
distinction
between
those
two.
i
think
that's
a
question
of
public
policy
which
the
people
of
the
state
has
spoken
to
on
separate
occasion.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
if
such
provision
were
addressed
to
the
voter,
i
think
that
would
be
bad.
mr.
george
m.
scott
possibly
on
a
mathematical
basis
yes
i
think
it
would
except
that
we're
dealing
here
with
60%
rather
than
two-thirds.
mr.
george
m.
scott
but
this
is
addressed
to
a
political
subdivision
mr.
justice
white,
this
says
--
this
restricts
the
part
of
political
subdivision.
it
says
you
cannot
borrow
money
unless
you
have
this
consensus.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
i
–-
it's
possible
that
it
would
--
yes,
you
are
going
to
have
precisely
the
same
result
on
the
mathematical
basis,
but
it's
not
a
question
of
mathematic
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
no
i
couldn't
make
that
argument.
mr.
george
m.
scott
if
it
were
addressed
to
the
voters
because
the
voters
were
being
treated
unequal.
here
the
voters
–-
every
man
stands
equally
before
this
court
mr.
justice
white,
every
man
has
the
same
burden,
that
is
to
carry
his
issue,
decide
the
issue
and
if
he
has
the
same
power
when
he
goes
in
to
the
polls,
i
don't
think
he
loses
that
power,
that
equality
of
power
by
casting
this
ballot.
mr.
george
m.
scott
but
the
method
of
–-
the
way
that
the
--
that
the
way
your
example
is
put
i
think
of
course
is
not
this
case,
but
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
it
would
be
addressed
to
the
voter
and
i
think
then
you
would
be
discriminating
between
people.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
you
certainly
have
to
take
the
–-
mr.
george
m.
scott
they
certainly
have
twice
the
effect
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
in
that
specific
context
is
justification
for
the
state
to
treat
its
citizens
unequally.
the
federal
analogy
hasn't
met
with
very
much
favor
at
the
hands
of
this
court,
although
i
do
want
to
employ
it
thereon
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
argument.
mr.
george
m.
scott
it
certainly
is
mr.
chief
justice
and
in
our
case
it's
spoken
to
it
in
three
separate
occasions
by
a
majority
vote
and
have
voluntary,
by
majority
vote.
a
restricted
to
powers
of
the
majority,
decided
to
protect
the
rights
to
the
minority
in
situations
like
this.
this
is
--
has
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
20
years,
5.5%,
amortized
over
a
period
of
20
years,
$1.800,000.00.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
turnout,
i
think
analogous.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
quite
so
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
it's
analogous
to
a
mortgage
of
real
estate.
it
is
and
in
fact
the
mortgage
of
property
even
a
person
is
not
born
at
that
time
of
the
election.
it
might
be
so,
people
not
yet
born
on
property
and
have
to
pay
taxes
on
it
as
minors
before
the
bonds
retire.
there
are
many
reasons,
many
justifications
i
think
for
such
a
public
policy
of
the
state,
but
i
don't
think
they
have
to
get
to
a
justification
of
this
because
i
don't
think
it's
discriminatory.
i
think
that
the
three-judge
district
court
in
missouri,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
reached
the
correct
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
discriminatory,
this
is
–-
every
person
stands
equally
before
this
type
of
provision.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
that's
true
where
as
here,
the
people
have
reserved
to
themselves
certain
legislative
powers
which
they
have
refused
to
delegate
to
the
public
office,
i
think
that's
true
and
whether
it's
a
10%
vote
or
a
90%
vote,
it
can
be
prohibited
entirely.
the
state
could
prohibit,
we
could
if
we
want
to
and
our
constitution
says
that
under
no
condition
shall
a
political
subdivision
borrow
money.
if
they
can
prohibit
it
entirely
why
can't
we
qualify
it?
i
think
we
can,
so
long
as
you
treat
everybody
alike
and
i
think
this
does,
every
man
stands
equally
when
they
face
this
type
of
the
requirement.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
george
m.
scott
we
have
separate
ballots
submitted
to
the
voter
and
if
we
accept
the
ballot
and
turned
it
back
in
to
the
poll
clerk
after
visiting
the
polling
booth
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
without
marking
it,
it
will
not
just
be
counted.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes
there
is
no
coram
requirement
in
our
state.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that
is
not
the
case
in
our
state.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
it
must
have
in
light
of
clay
versus
turner
which
this
court
–
it
came
up
from
south
carolina
this
past
summer
and
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question
when
that
argument
was
raised,
a
case
which
i
cited
in
my
reply
brief.
i
think
it
has
a
substantial
constitutional
deficiency.
i
don't
think
as
i
said
that
when
a
person
enters
the
polling
booth
that
he
loses,
regardless
of
how
he
marks
in
his
ballot,
he
loses
any
of
the
equality
that
he
had
before
he
went
in.
and
i
think
this
is
the
basic
error
made
in
the
california
case,
where
they
held
and
their
entire
62-page
opinion
rested
upon
one
thin
thread
when
they
said
that
it
was
classified
voters
and
it
was
sufficient
for
the
class
to
come
into
being
at
or
after
the
election.
it
was
not
necessary
for
there
to
be
prospective
discrimination,
it
was
sufficient
they
came
in
to
be
prospectively,
retrospectively
there
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
class.
there
is
not
even
an
identifiable
group
if
secrecy
of
the
ballot
is
to
be
preserved.
i
don't
think
you
that
can
come
in
of
course
i
suppose
and
say
i
voted
yey
or
ney,
but
if
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
is
to
be
present,
how
could
it
be
established
we
voted
yes
or
no.
and
i
think
this
is
the
reason
law
is
valid.
the
law
is
neutral,
the
law
is
based
on
neutral
principle
that's
addressed
not
to
the
voters
and
not
to
discriminate
against
people
but
against
specific
areas
of
government
action.
it's
addressed
to
specific
questions
of
public
policy,
shall
we
become
indebted
or
not.
it
doesn't,
i
mean
--
we
didn't
put
the
vote
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
go
ahead
have
them
schools
around
the
county.
the
question
was
are
we
going
to
go
ahead
with
the
program
that
we
have
or
were
going
to
increase
the
expenditures
in
a
certain
way
and
every
person
who
in
the
booth
had
a
different
reason
for
voting,
either
yes
or
no.
there's
many
reasons
for
voting
one
way
as
there
are
for
reverse
and
if
i
have
the
time
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
federal
analogy.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
hope
that
the
brenner
(ph)
opinion.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
don't
think
we
should
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
but
if
we
did,
i
think
certainly
there
are
good
reasons
as
i've
said
the
fact
that
the
people
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
didn't
brief
that
point
thoroughly,
no,
because
i
didn't
think
it
was
essential,
the
court
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
should
certainly
hope
not
mr.
justice
white
and
there
is
in
my
brief
the
arguments
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
missouri.
there
is
in
my
brief
the
argument
that
was
advanced
in
georgetown
law
journal
which
does
set
out
many
reasons
that
could
exist
here
to
justify
such
a
state
provision.
there
are
just
a
couple
of
things
about
the
provision.
i
know
that
the
in
the
allocation
of
senators,
when
used
for
college,
of
course
necessary
concessions
are
made
at
the
time
of
the
original
(inaudible)
but
we're
dealing
here
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
think
that
if
we
recall
that
the
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
contains
the
equal
protection
clause.
our
court
has
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
forbids
an
extraordinary
majority
requirement
and
yet
by
section
3
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
dealing
with
disqualification
of
officers
specifically
said,
that
congress
can
buy
two-thirds
of
vote
and
remove
those
disqualifications
seems
highly
irregular
to
me
to
suggest
that
one
section
of
this
amendment
forbids
an
extraordinary
majority
requirement
in
the
next
section
or
the
third
section
requires
it.
and
in
1967
the
twenty-fifth
amendment
(inaudible)
getting
down
in
more
recent
history
provides
for
an
extraordinary
majority
vote
by
congress
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
president
does
continue
to
disable
--
not
able
to
perform
the
duties
in
his
office.
so,
i
think
that
--
to
summarize
my
presentation
that
there's
no
specific
language
of
a
constitution
which
requires
this
result.
there
is
no
specific
holding
of
this
court
which
require
this
result.
there's
no
natural
law
or
rule
of
reason
which
requires
this
result.
our
--
framework
of
our
government
is
based
upon
a
delicate
balance
of
instances
of
minority
veto
such
as
we
have
here.
bicameral
legislatures,
this
doctrine
separation
of
powers,
doctrine
of
the
judicial
supremacy,
the
executive
veto,
all
instances
of
minority
veto
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
majority
rules,
strict
majority
is
to
become
the
only
acceptable
way
of
political
life
in
the
state
and
local
affairs
of
this
nation.
we
must
recognize
that
we've
embarked
upon
a
new
journey
of
uncertain
duration
down
a
new
avenue
of
judicial
activity.
this
unique
combination
as
i
spoke
of
has
been
the
very
source
of
strength
and
stability
of
this
great
nation
and
i
would
regret
to
see
it
destroyed.
mr.
george
m.
scott
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
by
way
of
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
two
of
three
things.
mr.
wise
has
made
the
point
at
the
last
that
30
odd
states
that
don't
have
this
rule,
don't
seemed
to
be
spendthrifts
and
getting
alright,
but
i
think
it
is
also
well
to
remember
that
the
20
odd
states
which
do
have,
at
least
a
great
percentage
of
them
as
far
as
we
know
are
getting
all
right
in
the
fields
of
education.
this
does
not
seemed
to
have
been
great
hindrance
to
them
in
that
area.
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
was
very
intriguing,
who
decides
where
lines
are
to
be
drawn
in
this
case
and
of
course
i
would
love
to
argue
that
this
is
political
question,
non-justiciable
and
if
there
was
anything
left
in
that
political
non-justiciable
political
question
in
theory,
i
think
this
would
be
a
classic
example
for
its
application.
i
would
like
to
remind
again
also
that
we're
dealing
here
not
with
the
question
of
minority
rule,
but
the
question
of
minority
veto.
it
seems
to
me
that
minority
rule
would
be
much
more
constitutionally
impermissible
than
minority
veto,
and
yet
we
elect
the
officers
everyday.
i
understand
the
last
election,
elected
senators
from
the
larger
states
by
39%
or
something
like
that
of
the
votes
cast.
we
elect
governors,
we
elect
members
of
the
legislatures
and
we
elect
--
as
i
recall
in
this
of
course
is
not
in
the
record
but
the
last
man
elected
to
the
board
of
education
of
roane
county
received
less
than
30%
of
the
total
vote
cast
in
the
election.
so
they
have
many
instances
of
minority
rule
which
i
think
are
much
worst
than
this,
and
this
is
of
course
just
minority
veto.
i
do
not
see
anything
wrong
with
protecting
minorities
as
i
said
earlier,
i
think
that
is
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
all
about.
then
the
use
of
this
word,
wait,
i
think
it
might
have
caused
some
of
the
--
what
i
considered
to
be
confusion
on
the
part
of
lower
court.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
i
could
have
used
a
better
word,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
it
means.
it
does
have
a
mathematical
connotation
when
we
should
i
think
are
dealing
with
philosophical
definition
of
this
word
equal.
and
i
recall
that
the
lower
court
quoted
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
gray
versus
sanders
in
which
he
--
it
was
stated
that
only
--
the
only
essence
of
weighting
of
votes
sanctioned
by
the
constitution
was
in
the
makeup
of
the
senate
and
used
for
electoral
college.
but
they
emphasized
the
world
only,
if
the
only
essence
of
weighting
a
vote
sanctioned
by
the
constitution
of
those
two
then
of
course
the
next
ordinary
majority
requirement
wouldn't
be
in
essence
of
weighting
a
vote
because
there
are
certainly
several
constitutional
areas
where
extra
ordinary
majority
votes
are
required.
mr.
george
m.
scott
no
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
no
provision
for
initiative
that
we
can
not
compel.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
george
m.
scott
exactly
and
they
expressed
it
very
clear
and
that
was
the
only
question
submitted
as
judge
haymond
points
in
his
dissent,
1966
in
a
majority
where
people
voted
three
times.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
could
not
answer
with
certainty.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
it
had
to
do
with
bond
issues
only
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
mr.
george
m.
scott
at
any
rate
it
was
the
question
of
policy
that
they
decided.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that
could
lead
to
60%
requirement
as
substitute
to
simple
majority.
mr.
george
m.
scott
majority
vote
carried
and
the
majority
to
vote
was
to
retain
a
60%
rule.
mr.
george
m.
scott
we
would
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
be
reversed.
mr.
george
m.
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
first
to
apologize
for
my
voice,
i've
had
laryngitis
the
last
few
days,
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
case
is
unique
i
think
in
the
annals
of
jurisprudence.
the
question
presented
has
never
before
been
presented
to
this
court.
the
question,
does
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
fourteenth
amendment
mean
majority
rule
in
special
elections
to
determine
questions
of
public
policy?
put
it
in
another
way,
does
the
60%
requirement,
the
extraordinary
majority
requirement
of
the
constitution
and
enabling
statutes
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution?
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute,
they're
simple
and
they're
brief.
in
my
home
county,
roane
county
in
west
virginia
on
april
1968,
the
board
of
education
submitted
to
the
people
for
decision,
two
issues.
the
first
question
was
whether
or
not
to
issue
of
a
$1,800,000.00
in
general
obligation
bond.
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
to
increase
the
rate
of
taxation
for
current
expenditures
beyond
the
constitutionally
prescribed
maximum
for
a
period
of
five
years.
on
each
of
these
issues,
approximately
51.51%
of
the
persons
voting,
voted
in
the
affirmative
and
of
course
the
issues
failed
the
passage
to
canvas
by
the
board
of
education
because
of
the
requisite
60%
of
the
voters
did
not
approve
the
issue.
constitution
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
was
adopted
in
1872.
at
that
time
the
60%
requirement
so
far
as
bond
indebtedness
or
any
indebtedness
extending
beyond
the
current
fiscal
year
was
part
of
the
constitution.
in
1932,
the
tax
limitation
amendment
was
adopted
which
set
forth
maximum
tax
rates
for
each
political
subdivision
and
this
limitation
amendment
provide
that
these
rates
could
not
be
exceeded
except
by
vote
of
the
people
and
60%
voting
in
the
affirmative.
in
1966,
an
amendment
was
presented
to
the
people
of
west
virginia
and
the
only
question
in
that
amendment
was
whether
or
not
to
amend
and
cancel
the
60%
requirement
and
substitute
a
simple
majority
requirement
and
the
people
voted
by
a
majority
to
retain
the
60%
rule.
despite
this
background
--
in
light
of
this
background,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
decided
at
the
instance
of
five
citizens
of
our
county,
allegedly
voted
in
the
affirmative
on
each
of
these
issues,
that
the
60%
requirement,
the
extraordinary
majority
requirement
was
inherently
discriminatory
in
that
it
diluted
or
debased
the
vote
of
the
persons
who
voted
yes
as
compared
to
the
vote
of
the
persons
who
voted
no.
these
issues
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
when
it's
submitted.
it's
submitted
at
the
instance
of
the
two-thirds
vote
of
each
house
of
the
legislature,
but
on
the
vote
of
the
people,
it
is
a
majority
vote
when
submitted
to
the
electorate
at
large.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
am
not
certain
your
honor,
i
think
the
dissent
of
judge
haymond
does
show
that.
mr.
george
m.
scott
1966,
your
honor.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
right.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
tax
limitation
amendment
dates
back
to
1932,
that's
the
levy.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yeah,
limiting
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
the
levy
rates.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
dates
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
1932,
the
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
bonding
of
the
–
our
political
subdivisions
have
always
been
prohibited
from
borrowing
money
except
by
approval
of
two-thirds
of
the
persons
voting
on
the
question
of
borrowing
money.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
my
understanding,
this
is
from
the
1872
constitution,
our
constitution
as
one
of
the
older
ones
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
we
think
that
this
--
and
of
course,
this
case
doesn't
present,
a
situation
earlier
was
--
a
discrimination
based
upon
race
or
religion
or
wealth
or
place
of
residence
or
marital
status
or
any
circumstance
that
prevailed
in
any
of
the
so-called
one
man,
one
vote
cases.
there
is
i
think
no
factual
analogy
between
those
cases
and
this
case,
and
yet
our
court
felt
obliged
by
virtue
of
the
language
in
the
opinions
of
those
cases,
to
hold
that
this
60%
requirement
was
inherently
discriminatory.
we
think
and
its
our
submission
that
this
is
a
monstrous
misapplication
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
and
to
support
this
submission,
i
have
cited
to
the
court
in
my
brief,
articles
which
have
appeared
in
virginia
law
review
and
georgetown
law
review.
i
have
also
cited
articles
which
have
appeared
in
the
harvard
law
review,
the
columbia
law
review,
houston
law
review,
vanderbilt
law
review,
the
west
virginia
law
review
and
there
are
others
and
the
commentators
are
severely
critical
of
this
decision,
i
think
without
exception.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
it's
certainly
beyond
dispute
mr.
justice
harlan
that
60
does
not
equal
40
and
this
is
i
think
the
basic
error
that
the
court
fell
into.
they
treated
this
as
a
problem
of
arithmetic
rather
than
a
problem
of
definition
or
one
of
philosophy.
i
think
that
–-
and
they
reached
this
profound
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
60
is
to
40
is
one-one-half
is
to
one,
but
the
rules
of
arithmetic
i
think
must
lead
to
an
absurd
result
because
if
you
say,
speaking
mathematically,
that
this
provision
is
inherently
discriminatory
then
mathematically
speaking
you
have
to
say
that
a
majority
rule
is
likewise
discriminatory
and
majority
as
to
minority
as
more
is
to
less
and
inherently
unequal,
so
the
rules
of
mathematics
i
think
can't
be
used.
mr.
george
m.
scott
only
on
the
basis
of
comparison
i
think
in
a
geographical
sense
and
also
in
a
all
together
a
different
context
where
the
–-
so
many
more
people
have
the
right
to
elect
only
one
delegate
as
opposed
fewer
people
in
another
area.
so
mathematics
does
have
a
play
there,
but
not
in
the
sense
that
i
want
to
present
here,
but
it
is
the
sense
of
equality.
it
doesn't
have
to
–-
one
doesn't
have
to
equal
one
before
there
can
be
constitutional
equality
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
george
m.
scott
ignored
it.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
court
said
that
the
federal
analogy
was
frivolous
and
wholly
beside
the
point.
i
want
to
get
to
that
a
little
later
too.
i
do
not
think
that
it's
frivolous
and
wholly
beside
the
point.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
record
did
not
show
that,
i
can
tell
you.
i
have
an
agreement
of
the
counsel
here.
there
were
8,911
registered
voters
in
roane
county
at
the
time
of
this
election.
the
record
does
show
how
many
persons
voted.
there
was
something
--
approximately
5,700
people
voted.so
approximately,
60%
of
the
actual
voters
voted.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
was
not
a
general
election.
this
was
a
special
election.
they
had
excellent
turnout,
i
think.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
the
60%
turnout
is
an
excellent
turnout.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
rural
area
in
the
spring,
when
the
roads
are
bad
and
these
are
generally
scheduled
i
might
add
mr.
justice
white
so
there
won't
be
too
heavy
turnout.
mr.
george
m.
scott
no,
i'm
certain.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
is
a
strictly
guess
mr.
justice
white
but
i
would
say
roughly
75%.
we
have
in
politically
minor
county.
so,
as
i've
said
in
an
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
not
a
mathematical
problem,
it's
a
philosophical
problem
and
of
course
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
2,800,
yes.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
would
say
the
same
thing,
i
think
it's
valid.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
not.
we're
getting
here
i
think
with
the
situation,
the
minority
veto,
of
course
our
constitution
and
our
history
is
full
of
instances
of
minority
veto
and
not
necessarily
the
minority
rule
where
we're
getting
in
situation
where
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
m.
scott
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
before
this
decision
i
thought
that's
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
all
about.
there's
one
thing
that
i
think
is
prevalent
here,
the
essence
i
think
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
voting
situation
is
that
everybody
should
have
the
equality
of
voting
power,
and
i
believe
that
the
court
below
more
or
less
conceded,
the
california
court
and
it's
a
scholarly
decision,
a
62-page
decision,
i
think
did
concede,
and
i
believe
that
my
adversary
here,
i
think
we
will
all
have
to
admit
that
whenever
–-
and
in
situation
like
this,
when
any
man
enters
the
voting
booth,
when
all
the
voters
first
go
to
the
poll,
before
the
election
is
held,
each
has
exactly
the
same
opportunity,
each
has
exactly
the
same
power
to
affect
the
ultimate
decision
as
every
other
voter.
regardless
of
how
he
votes,
he's
got
the
same
power
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election
when
he
goes
in.
this
wasn't
the
case
in
any
of
the
one
man
one
vote
cases
and
those
cases
seems
to
me
the
state
had
told
these
people,
regardless
of
how
you
vote,
your
vote
as
a
resident
of
this
populous
county
can
have
as
much
effect
on
the
ultimate
decision
making
process
as
the
vote
of
the
man
who
lives
in
the
less
populous
rural
area.
but
here,
the
state
has
told
the
people
you
each
have
equal
voice,
you
each
have
the
equal
power
to
affect
the
outcome.
the
extraordinary
majority
requirement
is
merely
a
rule
of
decision.
it
prescribes
how
many
votes
it
takes
to
win,
in
other
plurality
not
a
majority
but
a
60%
of
the
votes
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
that'd
be
monstrous,
i
think
that'd
be
monstrous
and
of
course
plain
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
the
candidates
are
individuals,
their
people
and
are
subjected
to
discrimination,
they
couldn't
be
treated
unequally
on
such
measure.
mr.
george
m.
scott
and
affirmative
than
a
negative,
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
on
affirmative
bond
issue
or
negative
bond
issue
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
is
not
a
person
subject
to
discrimination.
mr.
george
m.
scott
the
constitutional
amendment
is
one
certainly.
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
constitution
distinction
between
those
two.
i
think
that's
a
question
of
public
policy
which
the
people
of
the
state
has
spoken
to
on
separate
occasion.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
if
such
provision
were
addressed
to
the
voter,
i
think
that
would
be
bad.
mr.
george
m.
scott
possibly
on
a
mathematical
basis
yes
i
think
it
would
except
that
we're
dealing
here
with
60%
rather
than
two-thirds.
mr.
george
m.
scott
but
this
is
addressed
to
a
political
subdivision
mr.
justice
white,
this
says
--
this
restricts
the
part
of
political
subdivision.
it
says
you
cannot
borrow
money
unless
you
have
this
consensus.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
i
–-
it's
possible
that
it
would
--
yes,
you
are
going
to
have
precisely
the
same
result
on
the
mathematical
basis,
but
it's
not
a
question
of
mathematic
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
no
i
couldn't
make
that
argument.
mr.
george
m.
scott
if
it
were
addressed
to
the
voters
because
the
voters
were
being
treated
unequal.
here
the
voters
–-
every
man
stands
equally
before
this
court
mr.
justice
white,
every
man
has
the
same
burden,
that
is
to
carry
his
issue,
decide
the
issue
and
if
he
has
the
same
power
when
he
goes
in
to
the
polls,
i
don't
think
he
loses
that
power,
that
equality
of
power
by
casting
this
ballot.
mr.
george
m.
scott
but
the
method
of
–-
the
way
that
the
--
that
the
way
your
example
is
put
i
think
of
course
is
not
this
case,
but
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
it
would
be
addressed
to
the
voter
and
i
think
then
you
would
be
discriminating
between
people.
mr.
george
m.
scott
well,
you
certainly
have
to
take
the
–-
mr.
george
m.
scott
they
certainly
have
twice
the
effect
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
in
that
specific
context
is
justification
for
the
state
to
treat
its
citizens
unequally.
the
federal
analogy
hasn't
met
with
very
much
favor
at
the
hands
of
this
court,
although
i
do
want
to
employ
it
thereon
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
argument.
mr.
george
m.
scott
it
certainly
is
mr.
chief
justice
and
in
our
case
it's
spoken
to
it
in
three
separate
occasions
by
a
majority
vote
and
have
voluntary,
by
majority
vote.
a
restricted
to
powers
of
the
majority,
decided
to
protect
the
rights
to
the
minority
in
situations
like
this.
this
is
--
has
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
20
years,
5.5%,
amortized
over
a
period
of
20
years,
$1.800,000.00.
mr.
george
m.
scott
this
turnout,
i
think
analogous.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that's
quite
so
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
it's
analogous
to
a
mortgage
of
real
estate.
it
is
and
in
fact
the
mortgage
of
property
even
a
person
is
not
born
at
that
time
of
the
election.
it
might
be
so,
people
not
yet
born
on
property
and
have
to
pay
taxes
on
it
as
minors
before
the
bonds
retire.
there
are
many
reasons,
many
justifications
i
think
for
such
a
public
policy
of
the
state,
but
i
don't
think
they
have
to
get
to
a
justification
of
this
because
i
don't
think
it's
discriminatory.
i
think
that
the
three-judge
district
court
in
missouri,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
reached
the
correct
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
discriminatory,
this
is
–-
every
person
stands
equally
before
this
type
of
provision.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
that's
true
where
as
here,
the
people
have
reserved
to
themselves
certain
legislative
powers
which
they
have
refused
to
delegate
to
the
public
office,
i
think
that's
true
and
whether
it's
a
10%
vote
or
a
90%
vote,
it
can
be
prohibited
entirely.
the
state
could
prohibit,
we
could
if
we
want
to
and
our
constitution
says
that
under
no
condition
shall
a
political
subdivision
borrow
money.
if
they
can
prohibit
it
entirely
why
can't
we
qualify
it?
i
think
we
can,
so
long
as
you
treat
everybody
alike
and
i
think
this
does,
every
man
stands
equally
when
they
face
this
type
of
the
requirement.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
george
m.
scott
we
have
separate
ballots
submitted
to
the
voter
and
if
we
accept
the
ballot
and
turned
it
back
in
to
the
poll
clerk
after
visiting
the
polling
booth
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
--
without
marking
it,
it
will
not
just
be
counted.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes
there
is
no
coram
requirement
in
our
state.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that
is
not
the
case
in
our
state.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
it
must
have
in
light
of
clay
versus
turner
which
this
court
–
it
came
up
from
south
carolina
this
past
summer
and
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question
when
that
argument
was
raised,
a
case
which
i
cited
in
my
reply
brief.
i
think
it
has
a
substantial
constitutional
deficiency.
i
don't
think
as
i
said
that
when
a
person
enters
the
polling
booth
that
he
loses,
regardless
of
how
he
marks
in
his
ballot,
he
loses
any
of
the
equality
that
he
had
before
he
went
in.
and
i
think
this
is
the
basic
error
made
in
the
california
case,
where
they
held
and
their
entire
62-page
opinion
rested
upon
one
thin
thread
when
they
said
that
it
was
classified
voters
and
it
was
sufficient
for
the
class
to
come
into
being
at
or
after
the
election.
it
was
not
necessary
for
there
to
be
prospective
discrimination,
it
was
sufficient
they
came
in
to
be
prospectively,
retrospectively
there
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
class.
there
is
not
even
an
identifiable
group
if
secrecy
of
the
ballot
is
to
be
preserved.
i
don't
think
you
that
can
come
in
of
course
i
suppose
and
say
i
voted
yey
or
ney,
but
if
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
is
to
be
present,
how
could
it
be
established
we
voted
yes
or
no.
and
i
think
this
is
the
reason
law
is
valid.
the
law
is
neutral,
the
law
is
based
on
neutral
principle
that's
addressed
not
to
the
voters
and
not
to
discriminate
against
people
but
against
specific
areas
of
government
action.
it's
addressed
to
specific
questions
of
public
policy,
shall
we
become
indebted
or
not.
it
doesn't,
i
mean
--
we
didn't
put
the
vote
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
go
ahead
have
them
schools
around
the
county.
the
question
was
are
we
going
to
go
ahead
with
the
program
that
we
have
or
were
going
to
increase
the
expenditures
in
a
certain
way
and
every
person
who
in
the
booth
had
a
different
reason
for
voting,
either
yes
or
no.
there's
many
reasons
for
voting
one
way
as
there
are
for
reverse
and
if
i
have
the
time
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
federal
analogy.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
hope
that
the
brenner
(ph)
opinion.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
don't
think
we
should
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes,
but
if
we
did,
i
think
certainly
there
are
good
reasons
as
i've
said
the
fact
that
the
people
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
didn't
brief
that
point
thoroughly,
no,
because
i
didn't
think
it
was
essential,
the
court
--
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
should
certainly
hope
not
mr.
justice
white
and
there
is
in
my
brief
the
arguments
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
missouri.
there
is
in
my
brief
the
argument
that
was
advanced
in
georgetown
law
journal
which
does
set
out
many
reasons
that
could
exist
here
to
justify
such
a
state
provision.
there
are
just
a
couple
of
things
about
the
provision.
i
know
that
the
in
the
allocation
of
senators,
when
used
for
college,
of
course
necessary
concessions
are
made
at
the
time
of
the
original
(inaudible)
but
we're
dealing
here
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
think
that
if
we
recall
that
the
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
contains
the
equal
protection
clause.
our
court
has
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
forbids
an
extraordinary
majority
requirement
and
yet
by
section
3
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
dealing
with
disqualification
of
officers
specifically
said,
that
congress
can
buy
two-thirds
of
vote
and
remove
those
disqualifications
seems
highly
irregular
to
me
to
suggest
that
one
section
of
this
amendment
forbids
an
extraordinary
majority
requirement
in
the
next
section
or
the
third
section
requires
it.
and
in
1967
the
twenty-fifth
amendment
(inaudible)
getting
down
in
more
recent
history
provides
for
an
extraordinary
majority
vote
by
congress
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
president
does
continue
to
disable
--
not
able
to
perform
the
duties
in
his
office.
so,
i
think
that
--
to
summarize
my
presentation
that
there's
no
specific
language
of
a
constitution
which
requires
this
result.
there
is
no
specific
holding
of
this
court
which
require
this
result.
there's
no
natural
law
or
rule
of
reason
which
requires
this
result.
our
--
framework
of
our
government
is
based
upon
a
delicate
balance
of
instances
of
minority
veto
such
as
we
have
here.
bicameral
legislatures,
this
doctrine
separation
of
powers,
doctrine
of
the
judicial
supremacy,
the
executive
veto,
all
instances
of
minority
veto
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
majority
rules,
strict
majority
is
to
become
the
only
acceptable
way
of
political
life
in
the
state
and
local
affairs
of
this
nation.
we
must
recognize
that
we've
embarked
upon
a
new
journey
of
uncertain
duration
down
a
new
avenue
of
judicial
activity.
this
unique
combination
as
i
spoke
of
has
been
the
very
source
of
strength
and
stability
of
this
great
nation
and
i
would
regret
to
see
it
destroyed.
mr.
george
m.
scott
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
by
way
of
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
two
of
three
things.
mr.
wise
has
made
the
point
at
the
last
that
30
odd
states
that
don't
have
this
rule,
don't
seemed
to
be
spendthrifts
and
getting
alright,
but
i
think
it
is
also
well
to
remember
that
the
20
odd
states
which
do
have,
at
least
a
great
percentage
of
them
as
far
as
we
know
are
getting
all
right
in
the
fields
of
education.
this
does
not
seemed
to
have
been
great
hindrance
to
them
in
that
area.
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
was
very
intriguing,
who
decides
where
lines
are
to
be
drawn
in
this
case
and
of
course
i
would
love
to
argue
that
this
is
political
question,
non-justiciable
and
if
there
was
anything
left
in
that
political
non-justiciable
political
question
in
theory,
i
think
this
would
be
a
classic
example
for
its
application.
i
would
like
to
remind
again
also
that
we're
dealing
here
not
with
the
question
of
minority
rule,
but
the
question
of
minority
veto.
it
seems
to
me
that
minority
rule
would
be
much
more
constitutionally
impermissible
than
minority
veto,
and
yet
we
elect
the
officers
everyday.
i
understand
the
last
election,
elected
senators
from
the
larger
states
by
39%
or
something
like
that
of
the
votes
cast.
we
elect
governors,
we
elect
members
of
the
legislatures
and
we
elect
--
as
i
recall
in
this
of
course
is
not
in
the
record
but
the
last
man
elected
to
the
board
of
education
of
roane
county
received
less
than
30%
of
the
total
vote
cast
in
the
election.
so
they
have
many
instances
of
minority
rule
which
i
think
are
much
worst
than
this,
and
this
is
of
course
just
minority
veto.
i
do
not
see
anything
wrong
with
protecting
minorities
as
i
said
earlier,
i
think
that
is
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
all
about.
then
the
use
of
this
word,
wait,
i
think
it
might
have
caused
some
of
the
--
what
i
considered
to
be
confusion
on
the
part
of
lower
court.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
i
could
have
used
a
better
word,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
it
means.
it
does
have
a
mathematical
connotation
when
we
should
i
think
are
dealing
with
philosophical
definition
of
this
word
equal.
and
i
recall
that
the
lower
court
quoted
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
gray
versus
sanders
in
which
he
--
it
was
stated
that
only
--
the
only
essence
of
weighting
of
votes
sanctioned
by
the
constitution
was
in
the
makeup
of
the
senate
and
used
for
electoral
college.
but
they
emphasized
the
world
only,
if
the
only
essence
of
weighting
a
vote
sanctioned
by
the
constitution
of
those
two
then
of
course
the
next
ordinary
majority
requirement
wouldn't
be
in
essence
of
weighting
a
vote
because
there
are
certainly
several
constitutional
areas
where
extra
ordinary
majority
votes
are
required.
mr.
george
m.
scott
no
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
no
provision
for
initiative
that
we
can
not
compel.
mr.
george
m.
scott
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
george
m.
scott
exactly
and
they
expressed
it
very
clear
and
that
was
the
only
question
submitted
as
judge
haymond
points
in
his
dissent,
1966
in
a
majority
where
people
voted
three
times.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
could
not
answer
with
certainty.
mr.
george
m.
scott
i
think
it
had
to
do
with
bond
issues
only
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
mr.
george
m.
scott
at
any
rate
it
was
the
question
of
policy
that
they
decided.
mr.
george
m.
scott
that
could
lead
to
60%
requirement
as
substitute
to
simple
majority.
mr.
george
m.
scott
majority
vote
carried
and
the
majority
to
vote
was
to
retain
a
60%
rule.
mr.
george
m.
scott
we
would
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
be
reversed.
