j.
brennan,

well,
the
court's
opinion
says
to
show
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
that
that's
said
in
the
opinion
of
the
previous
court,
but
i
don't
know
why
they
did
tell
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
your
case
in
the
court,
then
they
do
not
have
to
comply
with
the
65?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
there
were
new
elections,
as
i
understand
you,
you
would
want
it
–
the
haven
of
the
1960--
under
the
haven
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
that
haven
was
the
violation
of
1962.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
made
what
by
statute
or
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
about
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
was
that
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
some
--
under
what
state
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather,
your
argument
is
even
if
–
that
in
any
event
on
either
those
changes,
there
is
a
requirement
of
either
attorney
general
approval
or
district
columbia
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
right
about
that
to
prevail
whatever
the
difficulty
then
arising
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
the
exhibits
support
a
contrary
conclusion
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
suggests
if
the
figure
instead
of
94
should
be
250
it
still
would
have
made
no
difference?
