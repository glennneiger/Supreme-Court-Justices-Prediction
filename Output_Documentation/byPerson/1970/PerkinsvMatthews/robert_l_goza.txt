mr.
robert
l.
goza
mr.
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellees
are
certainly
not
here
to
challenge
the
wisdom
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
upholding
its
constitutionality
generally
and
specifically
the
constitutionality
of
section
5.
we
are
here
to
defend
the
actions
of
the
city
of
canton
which
are
under
attack
by
the
appellants
and
that
attack
is
three-fold;
first
upon
the
annexation,
second
upon
on
the
polling
place
changes
and
third
upon
the
elections
at
large.
now
to
clarify
a
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
about
the
net
change
in
the
number
of
potential
voters
because
of
the
annexations,
perhaps
we
were
narrow,
but
it
was
my
understanding
that
three-judge
court
said
as
not
only
the
trier
of
the
fact,
but
to
make
the
decisions
in
regard
to
the
law,
at
the
hearing
in
the
lower
court.
that
court
found
that
there
was
a
net
gain
of
94
potential
white
voters
and
found
that
as
a
fact.
now
this
net
gain
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
stipulations
supports
those
figures
as
does
--
yes
your
honor,
as
does
of
the
testimony
and
as
does
the
finding
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
a
net
gain
of
94.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
the
majority
of
the
white
candidates
over
the
black
candidates
was
some
800
to
900
votes,
so
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
have
made
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
it
will
in
those,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes,
we
have
--
there
are
other
two
factors
which,
of
course,
they
contend
did
effect
the
election,
we
contend
did
not.
just
for
--
i
know
that
the
court
has
read
the
briefs,
but
just
to
clarify
the
point
i
made,
i
point
out
that
these
expansions
were
three.
there
were
three
separate
expansions.
they
were
done
in
1965
in
which
an
area
including
all
black
voters
--
all
potential
voters
was
annexed.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no
sir,
it
was
after
november
1,
1964
but
it
was
in
august
of
1965,
i
believe.
and
then
the
other
two
alleged,
one
in
1966
and
one
in
1968
and
stipulation
shows
that
these
were
done
pursuant
to
a
long
range
plan
of
the
city
of
canton
for
its
road
and
development.
it
was
not
something
that
cropped
the
path
to
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
statute
under
which
these
expansions
were
made
of
course
has
been
in
existence
long
before
the
voting
rights
act
was
never
dreamed
of
and
the
state
law
under
which
the
city
proceeded.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
1962
statute
which
permitted
elections
at
large
was
also
of
course
in
existence
prior
to
voting
rights
act,
and
it
was
true
that
city
had
not
followed
it
or
did
not
follow
in
1965.
those
were
the
two
things
which
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
view
of
the
statement
by
counsel
opposite
that
these
things
were
post
allen.
they
actually
were
not
post
allen.
they
were
done
prior
to
or
about
the
same
time
that
the
allen
decision
was
handed
down
by
this
court.
the
point
that
appellees
would
like
to
urge
is
this
and
the
question
before
the
court
as
we
see
it
is
this.
“does
the
court
wish
to
extend
or
expand
the
interpretation
of
section
5
as
laid
down
in
the
allen
case
to
the
extent
which
appellants
urge
and
reach
the
appalling
result
that
95%
of
any
municipal
enactment
or
administration
of
an
enactment
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
before
its
effective
or
should
the
court
put
the
bit
and
bridle
of
reason
of
the
common
sense
on
section
5
and
confine
it
within
that
practical
bounds
which
will
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
election
processes
shall
not
be
discriminatory
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
a
municipality
the
authority
and
the
power
to
conduct
the
management
of
its
affairs
in
an
orderly
fashion.
because
to
do
of
what
the
appellants
urge
you
to
do
and
to
hold
these
annexations
to
be
void
for
the
purpose
of
elections
which
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
that,
it's
either
got
to
be
a
valid
annexation
or
an
invalid
annexation.
you
cannot
have
the
people
in
the
city
paying
taxes
and
not
able
to
vote.
and
so
the
things
that,
that
will
happen
are
these.
you
question
the
policing
power
and
jurisdiction
in
these
areas
and
since
1965
in
one
case
and
1966
in
another
and
since
1968
in
another,
you
have
people
who
have
paid
municipal
taxes
for
period
of
five
years,
some
of
them
in
these
areas.
you
have
to
consider
the
affect
on
zoning,
housing
codes,
plumbing
building
codes,
on
just
about
every
facet
of
municipal
government
in
the
annexed
areas.
it
occurs
to
us
that
section
5
interpretation
should
be
limited
to
the
election
processes
which
we
could
summarize
as
this,
the
qualifications
and
eligibility
to
register.
the
registration
process
itself,
the
physical
act
of
casting
ballot
and
the
right
which
this
court
has
indelibly
inscribed
on
the
american
couches
of
having
your
vote,
or
the
vote
of
each
elector
cast
with
the
same
value
and
the
same
weight
as
all
other
votes
cast
in
that
election.
and
unless
some
enactment
or
administration
of
an
enactment
would
affect
one
of
these
four
phases
of
the
alleged
processes
then
it
should
not
come
within
section
5.
of
course
if
the
enactment
or
the
administration
of
the
enactment
remotely
affects
and
can
be
shown
to
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect,
inadequate
rights
prevail
under
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment,
as
the
case
might
be.
we
just
urge
upon
the
court,
these
annexations
should
not
be
construed
as
coming
within
section
5.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
you
run
here
all
into
the
practicalities
of
holding
an
election
in
a
small
town,
one
is
banning
a
polling
place.
now
at
first
blush,
you
might
think
that
that's
an
easy
thing
to
do,
but
it's
not
necessarily
so
and
you
have
to
take
a
place
with
adequate
facilities,
taking
into
consideration
parking,
the
effect
if
it
rains,
shelter
for
the
voters
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
it's
not
the
easiest
thing
in
world
to
do.
we
did
the
best
we
could
in
those
particular
cases,
the
polling
places
had
to
be
moved.
and
we
picked
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
is
the
only
logical
conclusion
to
reach.
that
if
it
can
be
shown,
that
these
polling
places
were
moved
for
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
that
if
they
had
a
discriminatory
effect
that
the
adequate
remedy
would
be
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
that
to
compel
the
city
of
canton
to
conduct
brand
new
election,
simply
because
the
two
banks
would
no
longer
permit
them
to
use
their
lobbies.
that
has
been
our
contention
all
the
way
through,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
could
be
held
and
we
think
the
record
adequately
shows
why
we
did
it.
we
tried
to
make
a
full
disclosure
to
the
three-judge
court
and
if
that
new
election
is
ordered
to
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
that's
correct
your
honor
and
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
well,
i
think
even
more
important
than
that
this
court
should
decide
whether
or
not
to
change
the
polling
place
with
no
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
is
a
change
within
the
meaning
of
section
5,
or
is
it
and
one
of
the
congressional
hearing
said,
the
distinction
between
voting
machines
and
paper
ballots.
we
also
went
to
voting
machines
in
this
election
and
had
been
using
paper
ballots
up
to
now,
has
as
such
a
change
as
to
warrant
the
holding
of
a
new
election
or
is
that
progress.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no
sir
that's
true
and
they
didn't
argue
about
the
1965
annexation
that
took
in
all
the
black
people
either
till
we
brought
into
the
case
ourselves.
but
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
this.
are
all
changes
regardless
of
the
degree,
such
changes
come
within
section
5
and
if
it's
violated,
require
new
election?
or
should
we
stick
to
the
things
which
effect
registration,
the
actual
voting
and
the
right
to
have
your
ballot
counted
equally.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
well,
the
district
lines
have
not
been
changed
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
well,
in
this
case
it
would
be
no
different
if
the
election
were
held
at
large.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
your
honor
it
is
a
change,
but
here
is
what
you
have
run
into
also
when
a
highway
or
anything
which
causes
as
an
increase
or
decrease
or
a
shift
in
population
from
one
area
of
the
city
to
another,
according
to
the
appellant's
contention,
is
a
change.
alright,
urban
renewal
projects,
(inaudible)
projects,
highway
relocations
all
of
those
things
have
that
effect.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no
sir
but
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
of
course,
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question
at
all.
to
me
the
things
are
different,
but
in
this
case
the
ward
lines
mean
absolutely
nothing
because
of
people
of
being
elected
at
large
now
or
at
least
that's
the
way
we
did
it.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
before
a
three-judge
court?
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes,
mr.
derfner
and
myself,
both
did.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
don't
recall
whether
it's
in
judge
coleman's
opinion
or
not,
but
we
contend
that
the
distinction
between
the
allen
case
as
we
did
before
the
three-judge
court
is
this
that
in
allen
case
what
the
court
decided
on
was
it
diluted
the
black
vote
by
extending
it
into
all
five
beats
of
the
county
when
in
effect
what
it
actually
did
was
it
put
the
influence
of
the
white
majority
into
the
two
black
beats.
in
this
case
there
is
a
majority
of
black
voters
in
the
city
of
canton.
what
we
did
when
the
election
was
called
at
large
was
to
extend
the
black
majority
through
all
four
beats
instead
of
confining
it
to
two
beats.
beats
three
and
four;
this
extended
it
to
all
four
beats
and
in
effect
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
polarization
and
the
black
vote,
in
effect
gave
the
black
majority
the
opportunity
to
elect
all
municipal
officers.
that
was
not
true
in
the
allen
case,
but
the
black
majority
prevails
in
the
city
of
canton.
and
they
had
an
opportunity
to
vote
in
wards
one
and
two
which
if
the
appellant's
contention
is
accepted
by
this
court
they
will
not
have.
we
contend
that
could
not
possibly
be
discriminatory
even
though
it
is
a
change.
now,
the
reason
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
why
the
1965
elections
was
not
held
in
accordance
with
the
1962
statute.
the
reason
is
it
was
a
my
mistake.
we
were
not
aware
of
the
1962
statute
when
the
1965
elections
was
held
and
therefore
was
not
followed.
at
the
time
of
1965
election,
there
were
some
200
black
voters
in
the
city
of
canton
and
it
was
certain
--
no
one
intend
to
discriminate
against
them
at
all
it
was
just
a
mistake
on
my
part,
even
though
that's
not
in
the
record,
that's
what
happened.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
mandatory.
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
i
just
said
that
mr.
(inaudible)
it
was
my
fault.
i
made
the
mistake.
i
did
not
read
the
pocket
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
robert
l.
goza
and
now
it
was
--
that
the
city
file
relied
on
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
it
was
just
a
mistake
which
was
stupid,
but
made
in
good
faith.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
not
that
i
am
aware
off.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
am
not
aware
if
it
sir
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
right,
in
1968
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
we
could
not
market
them.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
that's
correct
so
that
we
have
approximately
$1
million
worth
bonds
of
outstanding
now
in
annexed
areas
and
it
worked
to
prepare
to
take
in
the
annexed
areas.
and
i
don't
know
what
effect
that
will
have
on
all
those
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
canton,
mississippi.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
don't
know
what
the
1970
census
says
of
this;
1960
census
was
9707
and
we
expect
it
to
be
a
about
11,000
at
the
1970
census.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
sir.
but
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
must
be
some
practical
interpretation
placed
upon
section
5.
we
feel
that
the
allen
case
has
actually
gone
as
far
as
in
placing
the
broad
scope
on
it
as
it
can
and
still
allow
municipalities
who
acting
in
good
faith
and
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
record
or
suggestion
any
way,
that
the
city
has
acted
other
than
in
good
faith
which
would
permit
them
to
carry
on
the
normal
and
ordinary
functions
of
municipal
government
without
wearing
out
the
roads
to
washington
to
see
the
attorney
general
in
this
court
here.
it
cannot
be
that
every
single
act
that
the
city
performs,
because
everything
you
to
do
affects
the
people
in
the
city.
every
time
you
affect
people,
it
could
have
a
remote
affect
upon
voting
or
elections.
there
must
be
a
line
drawn
to
whether
the
effect
must
be
direct
rather
than
indirect.
we
urge
you
to
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
sir,
in
the
interest
of
small
municipalities
are
certainly
mr.
justice
black
because
it
is
hard
enough
to
function
as
bias
and
while
if
you
do
act
in
bad
faith
and
bad
motives
and
what
you
do
has
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect,
you
expect
to
be
called
or
told,
but
when
you
are
doing
the
best
you
can
and
have
the
best
interest
of
all
the
citizens,
black
or
white
within
the
city
at
heart
then
i
think
that
a
practical
approach
must
be
reached
to
this
section
5,
otherwise,
excuse
me
sir.
i
am
just
going
to
say
otherwise
everything
that
a
municipality
does
could
remotely
be
construed
is
coming
within
section
5
if
the
argument
of
the
appellants
is
accepted.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
sir?
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
that's
the
reason
we
called
ourselves
going
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
“the
one
man
one
vote”
cases
and
making
it
fair.
that's
what
we
really
felt
we
were
doing
and
because
we
understand
that
there
was
either
reapportion
of
the
wards
or
elect
the
officers
at
large
and
electing
at
large
seemed
to
be
the
fairest
way
to
do
it
and
that's
what
we
did.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
so
that
pretty
well
sums
up
our
contention
because
the
authority
to
veto
was
not
very
far
removed
from
the
power
to
compel
sub-division
to
do
something
if
you
can
veto
what
they
had
done
and
the
next
step
is
to
make
them
do
something
else
and
we
contend
that
it's
not.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
anything
that
did
not
pertain
to
qualifications
and
eligibility
to
register.
the
registration
process
itself,
the
physical
casting
of
the
ballot
and
the
right
to
have
your
ballot
counted
with
equal
weight
as
all
other
ballots
cast
in
elections.
if
it
did
not
come
within
those
four
things
and
i
don't
think
that
section
5
should
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
because
if
it
didn't
come
within
those
four
things
and
certainly
these
three
things
they
are
complaining
about
do
not,
then
any
remedy
should
be
under
either
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
mr.
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellees
are
certainly
not
here
to
challenge
the
wisdom
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
upholding
its
constitutionality
generally
and
specifically
the
constitutionality
of
section
5.
we
are
here
to
defend
the
actions
of
the
city
of
canton
which
are
under
attack
by
the
appellants
and
that
attack
is
three-fold;
first
upon
the
annexation,
second
upon
on
the
polling
place
changes
and
third
upon
the
elections
at
large.
now
to
clarify
a
question
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
about
the
net
change
in
the
number
of
potential
voters
because
of
the
annexations,
perhaps
we
were
narrow,
but
it
was
my
understanding
that
three-judge
court
said
as
not
only
the
trier
of
the
fact,
but
to
make
the
decisions
in
regard
to
the
law,
at
the
hearing
in
the
lower
court.
that
court
found
that
there
was
a
net
gain
of
94
potential
white
voters
and
found
that
as
a
fact.
now
this
net
gain
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
stipulations
supports
those
figures
as
does
--
yes
your
honor,
as
does
of
the
testimony
and
as
does
the
finding
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
a
net
gain
of
94.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
the
majority
of
the
white
candidates
over
the
black
candidates
was
some
800
to
900
votes,
so
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
have
made
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
it
will
in
those,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes,
we
have
--
there
are
other
two
factors
which,
of
course,
they
contend
did
effect
the
election,
we
contend
did
not.
just
for
--
i
know
that
the
court
has
read
the
briefs,
but
just
to
clarify
the
point
i
made,
i
point
out
that
these
expansions
were
three.
there
were
three
separate
expansions.
they
were
done
in
1965
in
which
an
area
including
all
black
voters
--
all
potential
voters
was
annexed.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no
sir,
it
was
after
november
1,
1964
but
it
was
in
august
of
1965,
i
believe.
and
then
the
other
two
alleged,
one
in
1966
and
one
in
1968
and
stipulation
shows
that
these
were
done
pursuant
to
a
long
range
plan
of
the
city
of
canton
for
its
road
and
development.
it
was
not
something
that
cropped
the
path
to
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
statute
under
which
these
expansions
were
made
of
course
has
been
in
existence
long
before
the
voting
rights
act
was
never
dreamed
of
and
the
state
law
under
which
the
city
proceeded.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
1962
statute
which
permitted
elections
at
large
was
also
of
course
in
existence
prior
to
voting
rights
act,
and
it
was
true
that
city
had
not
followed
it
or
did
not
follow
in
1965.
those
were
the
two
things
which
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
view
of
the
statement
by
counsel
opposite
that
these
things
were
post
allen.
they
actually
were
not
post
allen.
they
were
done
prior
to
or
about
the
same
time
that
the
allen
decision
was
handed
down
by
this
court.
the
point
that
appellees
would
like
to
urge
is
this
and
the
question
before
the
court
as
we
see
it
is
this.
“does
the
court
wish
to
extend
or
expand
the
interpretation
of
section
5
as
laid
down
in
the
allen
case
to
the
extent
which
appellants
urge
and
reach
the
appalling
result
that
95%
of
any
municipal
enactment
or
administration
of
an
enactment
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
before
its
effective
or
should
the
court
put
the
bit
and
bridle
of
reason
of
the
common
sense
on
section
5
and
confine
it
within
that
practical
bounds
which
will
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
election
processes
shall
not
be
discriminatory
and
at
the
same
time
ensure
a
municipality
the
authority
and
the
power
to
conduct
the
management
of
its
affairs
in
an
orderly
fashion.
because
to
do
of
what
the
appellants
urge
you
to
do
and
to
hold
these
annexations
to
be
void
for
the
purpose
of
elections
which
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
that,
it's
either
got
to
be
a
valid
annexation
or
an
invalid
annexation.
you
cannot
have
the
people
in
the
city
paying
taxes
and
not
able
to
vote.
and
so
the
things
that,
that
will
happen
are
these.
you
question
the
policing
power
and
jurisdiction
in
these
areas
and
since
1965
in
one
case
and
1966
in
another
and
since
1968
in
another,
you
have
people
who
have
paid
municipal
taxes
for
period
of
five
years,
some
of
them
in
these
areas.
you
have
to
consider
the
affect
on
zoning,
housing
codes,
plumbing
building
codes,
on
just
about
every
facet
of
municipal
government
in
the
annexed
areas.
it
occurs
to
us
that
section
5
interpretation
should
be
limited
to
the
election
processes
which
we
could
summarize
as
this,
the
qualifications
and
eligibility
to
register.
the
registration
process
itself,
the
physical
act
of
casting
ballot
and
the
right
which
this
court
has
indelibly
inscribed
on
the
american
couches
of
having
your
vote,
or
the
vote
of
each
elector
cast
with
the
same
value
and
the
same
weight
as
all
other
votes
cast
in
that
election.
and
unless
some
enactment
or
administration
of
an
enactment
would
affect
one
of
these
four
phases
of
the
alleged
processes
then
it
should
not
come
within
section
5.
of
course
if
the
enactment
or
the
administration
of
the
enactment
remotely
affects
and
can
be
shown
to
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect,
inadequate
rights
prevail
under
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment,
as
the
case
might
be.
we
just
urge
upon
the
court,
these
annexations
should
not
be
construed
as
coming
within
section
5.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
you
run
here
all
into
the
practicalities
of
holding
an
election
in
a
small
town,
one
is
banning
a
polling
place.
now
at
first
blush,
you
might
think
that
that's
an
easy
thing
to
do,
but
it's
not
necessarily
so
and
you
have
to
take
a
place
with
adequate
facilities,
taking
into
consideration
parking,
the
effect
if
it
rains,
shelter
for
the
voters
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
it's
not
the
easiest
thing
in
world
to
do.
we
did
the
best
we
could
in
those
particular
cases,
the
polling
places
had
to
be
moved.
and
we
picked
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
is
the
only
logical
conclusion
to
reach.
that
if
it
can
be
shown,
that
these
polling
places
were
moved
for
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
that
if
they
had
a
discriminatory
effect
that
the
adequate
remedy
would
be
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
that
to
compel
the
city
of
canton
to
conduct
brand
new
election,
simply
because
the
two
banks
would
no
longer
permit
them
to
use
their
lobbies.
that
has
been
our
contention
all
the
way
through,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
could
be
held
and
we
think
the
record
adequately
shows
why
we
did
it.
we
tried
to
make
a
full
disclosure
to
the
three-judge
court
and
if
that
new
election
is
ordered
to
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
that's
correct
your
honor
and
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
well,
i
think
even
more
important
than
that
this
court
should
decide
whether
or
not
to
change
the
polling
place
with
no
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect
is
a
change
within
the
meaning
of
section
5,
or
is
it
and
one
of
the
congressional
hearing
said,
the
distinction
between
voting
machines
and
paper
ballots.
we
also
went
to
voting
machines
in
this
election
and
had
been
using
paper
ballots
up
to
now,
has
as
such
a
change
as
to
warrant
the
holding
of
a
new
election
or
is
that
progress.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no
sir
that's
true
and
they
didn't
argue
about
the
1965
annexation
that
took
in
all
the
black
people
either
till
we
brought
into
the
case
ourselves.
but
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
this.
are
all
changes
regardless
of
the
degree,
such
changes
come
within
section
5
and
if
it's
violated,
require
new
election?
or
should
we
stick
to
the
things
which
effect
registration,
the
actual
voting
and
the
right
to
have
your
ballot
counted
equally.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
well,
the
district
lines
have
not
been
changed
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
well,
in
this
case
it
would
be
no
different
if
the
election
were
held
at
large.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
your
honor
it
is
a
change,
but
here
is
what
you
have
run
into
also
when
a
highway
or
anything
which
causes
as
an
increase
or
decrease
or
a
shift
in
population
from
one
area
of
the
city
to
another,
according
to
the
appellant's
contention,
is
a
change.
alright,
urban
renewal
projects,
(inaudible)
projects,
highway
relocations
all
of
those
things
have
that
effect.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no
sir
but
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
of
course,
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question
at
all.
to
me
the
things
are
different,
but
in
this
case
the
ward
lines
mean
absolutely
nothing
because
of
people
of
being
elected
at
large
now
or
at
least
that's
the
way
we
did
it.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
before
a
three-judge
court?
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes,
mr.
derfner
and
myself,
both
did.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
don't
recall
whether
it's
in
judge
coleman's
opinion
or
not,
but
we
contend
that
the
distinction
between
the
allen
case
as
we
did
before
the
three-judge
court
is
this
that
in
allen
case
what
the
court
decided
on
was
it
diluted
the
black
vote
by
extending
it
into
all
five
beats
of
the
county
when
in
effect
what
it
actually
did
was
it
put
the
influence
of
the
white
majority
into
the
two
black
beats.
in
this
case
there
is
a
majority
of
black
voters
in
the
city
of
canton.
what
we
did
when
the
election
was
called
at
large
was
to
extend
the
black
majority
through
all
four
beats
instead
of
confining
it
to
two
beats.
beats
three
and
four;
this
extended
it
to
all
four
beats
and
in
effect
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
polarization
and
the
black
vote,
in
effect
gave
the
black
majority
the
opportunity
to
elect
all
municipal
officers.
that
was
not
true
in
the
allen
case,
but
the
black
majority
prevails
in
the
city
of
canton.
and
they
had
an
opportunity
to
vote
in
wards
one
and
two
which
if
the
appellant's
contention
is
accepted
by
this
court
they
will
not
have.
we
contend
that
could
not
possibly
be
discriminatory
even
though
it
is
a
change.
now,
the
reason
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
why
the
1965
elections
was
not
held
in
accordance
with
the
1962
statute.
the
reason
is
it
was
a
my
mistake.
we
were
not
aware
of
the
1962
statute
when
the
1965
elections
was
held
and
therefore
was
not
followed.
at
the
time
of
1965
election,
there
were
some
200
black
voters
in
the
city
of
canton
and
it
was
certain
--
no
one
intend
to
discriminate
against
them
at
all
it
was
just
a
mistake
on
my
part,
even
though
that's
not
in
the
record,
that's
what
happened.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
mandatory.
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
i
just
said
that
mr.
(inaudible)
it
was
my
fault.
i
made
the
mistake.
i
did
not
read
the
pocket
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
robert
l.
goza
and
now
it
was
--
that
the
city
file
relied
on
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
it
was
just
a
mistake
which
was
stupid,
but
made
in
good
faith.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
not
that
i
am
aware
off.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
am
not
aware
if
it
sir
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
right,
in
1968
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
we
could
not
market
them.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
that's
correct
so
that
we
have
approximately
$1
million
worth
bonds
of
outstanding
now
in
annexed
areas
and
it
worked
to
prepare
to
take
in
the
annexed
areas.
and
i
don't
know
what
effect
that
will
have
on
all
those
--
mr.
robert
l.
goza
canton,
mississippi.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
i
don't
know
what
the
1970
census
says
of
this;
1960
census
was
9707
and
we
expect
it
to
be
a
about
11,000
at
the
1970
census.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
sir.
but
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
must
be
some
practical
interpretation
placed
upon
section
5.
we
feel
that
the
allen
case
has
actually
gone
as
far
as
in
placing
the
broad
scope
on
it
as
it
can
and
still
allow
municipalities
who
acting
in
good
faith
and
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
record
or
suggestion
any
way,
that
the
city
has
acted
other
than
in
good
faith
which
would
permit
them
to
carry
on
the
normal
and
ordinary
functions
of
municipal
government
without
wearing
out
the
roads
to
washington
to
see
the
attorney
general
in
this
court
here.
it
cannot
be
that
every
single
act
that
the
city
performs,
because
everything
you
to
do
affects
the
people
in
the
city.
every
time
you
affect
people,
it
could
have
a
remote
affect
upon
voting
or
elections.
there
must
be
a
line
drawn
to
whether
the
effect
must
be
direct
rather
than
indirect.
we
urge
you
to
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
sir,
in
the
interest
of
small
municipalities
are
certainly
mr.
justice
black
because
it
is
hard
enough
to
function
as
bias
and
while
if
you
do
act
in
bad
faith
and
bad
motives
and
what
you
do
has
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect,
you
expect
to
be
called
or
told,
but
when
you
are
doing
the
best
you
can
and
have
the
best
interest
of
all
the
citizens,
black
or
white
within
the
city
at
heart
then
i
think
that
a
practical
approach
must
be
reached
to
this
section
5,
otherwise,
excuse
me
sir.
i
am
just
going
to
say
otherwise
everything
that
a
municipality
does
could
remotely
be
construed
is
coming
within
section
5
if
the
argument
of
the
appellants
is
accepted.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
sir?
mr.
robert
l.
goza
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
that's
the
reason
we
called
ourselves
going
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
“the
one
man
one
vote”
cases
and
making
it
fair.
that's
what
we
really
felt
we
were
doing
and
because
we
understand
that
there
was
either
reapportion
of
the
wards
or
elect
the
officers
at
large
and
electing
at
large
seemed
to
be
the
fairest
way
to
do
it
and
that's
what
we
did.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
yes
so
that
pretty
well
sums
up
our
contention
because
the
authority
to
veto
was
not
very
far
removed
from
the
power
to
compel
sub-division
to
do
something
if
you
can
veto
what
they
had
done
and
the
next
step
is
to
make
them
do
something
else
and
we
contend
that
it's
not.
mr.
robert
l.
goza
your
honor,
anything
that
did
not
pertain
to
qualifications
and
eligibility
to
register.
the
registration
process
itself,
the
physical
casting
of
the
ballot
and
the
right
to
have
your
ballot
counted
with
equal
weight
as
all
other
ballots
cast
in
elections.
if
it
did
not
come
within
those
four
things
and
i
don't
think
that
section
5
should
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
because
if
it
didn't
come
within
those
four
things
and
certainly
these
three
things
they
are
complaining
about
do
not,
then
any
remedy
should
be
under
either
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment.
