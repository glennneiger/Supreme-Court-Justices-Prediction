have
we
done
that
in
reapportionment
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
now
how
can
you,
just
as
a
practical
matter
how
can
you
have,
if
you
had
an
election,
how
can
you
compel
these
people
who
have
refused
to
have
their
property
used
as
a
polling
places,
to
have
their
property
used
as
polling
places?
that's
private
property.
justice
potter
stewart
particularly,
the
property
of
bank
i
think
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you
have
three
--
there
are
three
factors
here
about
which
you
complaint.
one
is
the
changing
of
the
polling
places.
the
other
one
is
changing
to
an
at-large
election
of
the
ward,
who
had
previously
been
elected
by
wards,
and
the
third
is
the
annexation
of
a
territory
and
its
people
to
the
city
and
then
the
new
election,
these
people
have
been
annexed
to
the
city
without
be
allowed
to
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
respect
to
the
second
one
i
mentioned
there
should
be
at-large
--
there
should
be
a
ward
election,
even
though
that
violates
the
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
its
well
settled
that
the
other
two
factors
do
come
under
the
statute
and
it's
changing
places.
justice
potter
stewart
does
a
record
show
whether
these
polling
places
were
changed
--
there
were
some
change
at
least
in
the
polling
places
every
single
election?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
the
first
change
and
first
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
the
changes
made
after
the
1965
civil
rights
act,
after
section
5
came
on?
what
were
the
changes
made
here
after
the
1965
federal
act
came?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
what
were
they?
you
said
to
me
earlier
that
there
were
two
changes
anyway
so
you
would
still
be
here
