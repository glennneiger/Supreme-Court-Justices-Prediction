mr.
armand
derfner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
acts
of
1965
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
a
fourth
such
appeal
in
three
terms
of
court.
first
three
having
decided
by
this
court,
reversing
the
lower
court
in
the
case
of
allen
versus
state
board
of
elections.
i
believe
the
question
on
the
merits
here
is
quite
simple
and
i
plan
to
devote
about
a
small
portion
of
the
argument
in
demonstrating
the
court
below
was
wrong
on
all
three
of
the
questions
that
it
faced.
the
vital
question
in
this
case
is
a
question
for
relief
and
that
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
whether
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
acts
of
1965
is
to
be
permitted
to
occupy
the
critical
place
that
congress
intended
for
it
in
1965
and
reaffirmed
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
when
it
extended
the
act
in
1970.
to
advert
very
briefly
to
the
facts,
the
city
of
canton
in
mississippi
for
its
municipal
elections
in
1969
adopted
three
changes
from
the
procedure
that
it
had
governed
the
prior
municipal
election
in
1965.
they
went
from
individual
board
elections
to
at
large
elections
in
a
town
in
which
there
are
two
wards
that
are
very
heavily
black.
they
moved
the
polling
places,
in
one
case
from
the
town
square
to
an
old
jail
and
in
another
case
from
the
middle
of
the
black
neighborhood
and
heavily
black
ward
to
a
point
just
adjacent
to
a
newly
annexed
white
neighborhood,
and
third,
they
extended
the
boundaries
of
the
town
in
such
a
way
as
to
add
several
hundred
net
additional
white
residents,
that
is
several
hundred
more
white
residents
than
black
residents.
mr.
armand
derfner
wards,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
are
3
and
4
and
my
brief
gives,
i
believe
the
record
too
gives
the
registration
figures
for
all
the
wards.
all
these
changes
are
familiar
ones.
they
are
all
changes
of
the
type
that
had
been
submitted
by
other
jurisdictions
to
the
attorney
general
as
can
be
shown
by
looking
at
page
309
of
the
house
hearings.
they
are
all
changes
of
the
type
that
congress
mentioned
many,
many
times
in
the
debates
in
1969
and
1970
on
the
extension.
the
best
example
of
that
is
perhaps
congressman
mcculloch
who
was
perhaps
the
leading
minority
member
in
the
house,
involved
both
in
the
1965
act
and
1970
extension.
he
was
in
each
of
these
three
kinds
of
changes
as
types
they
were
covered
by
the
voting
by
section
5.
judge
nixon,
the
single
judge,
on
the
basis
of
the
boundary
extension
alone
granted
an
injunction
against
having
the
election.
the
case
then
went
forward
and
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court
which
held
without
quite
saying
ever,
without
saying
actually
that
any
of
these
changes
that
was
not
covered
by
section
5,
it
went
into
the
motives
of
the
changes
which
this
court
has
conclusively
held
are
to
be
decided
only
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
and
pronounced
these
changes
did
not
violate
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
of
course
we
do.
what
i
am
saying,
however
is
that,
that
is
not
a
question
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
this
court
in
the
allen
case
made
it
clear
and
i
think
justice
harlan
asked
that
precise
question
there
that
that
is
not
a
question
we
have
to
decide
now
or
have
to
prove.
all
we
have
to
prove
is,
if
there
was
a
change
and
there
is
an
adequate
procedure
set
up
by
section
5
to
determine
what
the
good
faith
or
lack
thereof
was.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
in
fact,
it
doesn't
even
have
to
alter
these
lines
invidiously.
all
it
has
to
do
is
alter
these
lines
and
at
that
point
congress
says
that
is
a
matter
that
you
cannot
take
up
any
place,
but
with
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
ends
the
matter
in
a
section
5
case.
the
court
below
had
only
to
decide
as
judge
nixon
said
when
he
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order,
i
have
to
decide,
was
there
a
change?
the
answer
is,
yes.
was
it
submitted?
the
answer
is,
no.
at
that
point
the
matter
is
taken
out
of
my
hands
and
the
election
cannot
go
forward
on
this
basis.
mr.
armand
derfner
certainly,
we
wouldn't
be
suing
on
meaningless
cases.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
believe
they
did
not
cite.
they
were
certainly
aware
of
it,
it
in
fact
having
come
from
--
well
three
of
those
cases
having
come
from
that
same
court.
so
i
say
that
the
merits
are
easy
question.
the
vital
question
is
what
is
the
relief
to
be
given
in
this
case,
and
on
a
very
simple
plain,
that
is
an
easy
question
too.
the
very
simple
plain
says
there
must
be
a
new
election,
and
we
maintain
there
must
be
a
new
election
and
that
there
can't
be
any
question
about
that.
the
law
is
clear
in
election
cases,
in
the
cases
such
as
hamer
versus
campbell
in
the
fifth
circuit,
united
states
versus
barbara
county,
a
case
in
the
district
court.
cases
such
as
hadnott
versus
amos
for
that
example,
that
if
you
assert
you
remedies
in
timely
fashion
in
a
voting
case,
particularly,
in
a
fifteenth
amendment
case,
but
certainly
equally
well
in
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
such
as
a
property
tax
cases
or
more
recently
apportionment
cases,
then
if
it
develops
after
the
election
has
being
held
--
that
you
didn't
get
the
relief
and
election
is
held.
if
it
develops
thereafter
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
an
injunction,
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
the
election
set
aside.
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
am
not
certain
that
this
court
has
done
that.
this
court
has
certainly
indicated
that
could
be
done
and
lower
courts
have
done
it.
i
know
that
fifth
circuit
has
done
it
in
the
case
coming
from
monroe
county,
mississippi.
mr.
armand
derfner
this
court
has
refused
to
do
it.
in
allen,
if
you
are
talking
about
this
case,
this
court
said
specifically
that
these
section
5
question,
coverage
questions
involve
complex
issues
of
first
impression.
issues
subject
to
rationale
disagreement.
the
state
enactments
were
not
so
clearly
subject
to
section
5
and
so
forth.
therefore,
we
give
only
prospective
affect
to
our
decision.
i
think
that
was
a
clear
indication
as
clear
--
perhaps
as
clear
as
the
indication
as
the
explicit
language
in
the
tax
cases
that
thenceforward,
jurisdiction
would
have
been
on
notice
that
if
they
didn't
submit
the
proper
remedy
was
a
new
election.
and
that
is
a
traditional,
as
i
say,
basically
it's
come
to
be
a
traditional
equitable
remedy
in
election
cases
and
i
think
that
the
ordinary
rule
there
would
be
that
there
should
a
new
election
unless
there
are
special
circumstances.
there
were
special
circumstances
in
allen
as
they
are
often
are
when
a
court,
and
this
court
especially
decides
a
case
involving
a
whole
new
body
of
law.
there
are
no
special
circumstances
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
reason
that
the
city
of
canton
has
advanced
or
could
advance
for
why
it
should
not
be
governed
by
the
general
rule.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
terms
are
four
years.
they
were
to
have
begun
in
july
of
1969.
they
will
close
in
july
of
1973.
the
election
in
this
case
did
take
place
in
october,
the
primaries
and
the
general
election
in
october,
1969.
the
basic
question,
and
this
is
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
as
to
that
particular
--
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
but
a
couple
of
them
were
public
places.
i
think
two
of
them
--
at
least
one
of
them
was
in
a
court
house
and
the
other
one
was
also
the
public
place.
i
certainly
admit
that
there
would
in
some
cases
have
to
be
an
impossibility
exception
indicating
that
there
might
have
be
a
change
and
if
that
was
so,
if
the
city
could
come
forward
and
show
that
it
was
totally
impossible,
not
simply
impractical
or
inadvisable,
but
impossible
to
hold
an
election
in
a
certain
place
or
impossible
to
do
a
certain
thing,
then
they
could
submit
that
to
the
attorney
general,
get
a
quick
approval
and
put
that
change
into
effect.
i
would
limit
that
to
the
very
barest
minimum
in
impossibility
cases.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
precisely
the
difficult
question
facing
this
court
and
that's
precisely
the
answer
i
give,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
not
be
allowed
to
vote.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
the
new
election
must
take
place
immediately
or
within
30
or
60
days.
only
as
much
time
as
is
required
to
prepare
ballots
and
do
the
things
that
are
necessary
for
a
election,
get
out
notice
and
so
forth
and
that
election
must
be
conducted
under
the
rules
that
applied
at
--
under
the
valid
rules
that
applied
at
the
time
the
election
should
have
taken
place.
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
correct,
and
if
i
may
just
take
a
few
moments,
i
will
explain
precisely
why
i
take
that
position.
the
short
answer,
why
that
position
must
be
taken
is
if
any
other
position
is
taken,
there
will
be
no
section
5
in
the
act.
section
5
will
have
become
almost
totally
meaningless.
the
only
change
it
will
have
resulted
in
is
a
significant
change,
yes,
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
in
some
of
this
cases.
mr.
armand
derfner
at
least
as
good
and
no
better
and
the
declaratory
judgment
doesn't
give
us
a
new
election.
quite
frankly,
i
think
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
the
advantage
of
a
congress
that
in
1969
and
1970
debated
extensively,
several
100
pages
of
a
congressional
record
and
at
least
1200
to
1500
pages
of
hearings
of
reports,
what
should
happen
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement,
that
the
bulk
of
that
debate
aside
from
question
such
--
involving
new
question
such
as
the
general
banning
of
the
literacy
test
and
the
18-year
old
vote
and
the
residence
and
absentee
provision,
the
bulk
of
the
argument
dealt
with
section
5
and
the
debate
is
replete
with
discussion
over
the
importance
of
section
5.
basically
the
history
is
quite
clear,
a
bill
was
introduced
which
i
believe
the
record
would
show
had
administration
backing,
the
justice
department
testified
for
it,
a
bill
was
introduced
which
would
have
abolished
the
pre-clearance
procedures
of
section
5.
this
bill
was
supported
in
critical
testimony
by
the
attorney
general
and
especially
by
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
david
norman.
in
his
testimony,
it
appears
at
pages
500
and
following
of
the
senate
hearings.
at
those
hearings,
both
the
attorney
general
and
mr.
norman
testified
explicitly
that
section
--
that
there
was
no
need
for
section
5
because
in
fact
all
section
5
did
was
to
provide
the
following
remedy.
this
is
explicitly
stated
by
mr.
norman,
section
5
provides
only
the
remedy
that
if
you
win
a
section
5
case,
then
the
jurisdiction
that
didn't
submit
the
matter
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
of
columbia
court
must
then
submit
it.
i
think
the
congressional
debates
and
the
outcome
of
what
happened
in
congress
is
as
clear
reputation
of
that
position
as
is
possible
to
take.
and
if
i
might
just,
at
this
point
discuss
very
briefly
the
legislative
history,
and
i
might
say
that
much
of
this
is
not
specifically
cited
in
the
brief.
there
were
numerous
statements
in
congress
dealing
with
the
importance
of
section
5.
there
was
no
report
from
the
senate
judiciary
committee
or
from
any
subcommittee
because
the
bill
had
been
submitted,
the
extension
bill
had
been
submitted
under
rule
requiring
a
report
or
requiring
to
be
reported
out
by
april
1st,
there
was
no
time
for
a
report.
there
was
however
a
joint
statement
signed
by
ten
senators
who
constituted
the
majority
of
the
17.
this
report
is
in
the
congressional
record
and
is
at
pages
2756
and
following.
it's
a
monthly
report,
discusses
section
5
in
great
detail
and
has
three
italicized
sentences
throughout
the
whole
report,
each
of
which
italicized
sentences
refers
to
section
5.
as
an
example,
this
section,
it's
on
page
2756,
this
section
in
effect
freezes
election
procedures
in
the
covered
areas
unless
the
changes
can
be
shown
to
be
non-discriminatory.
there
were
other
even
more
explicit
statements
representative
corman
(ph)
in
discussing
the
differences
between
the
two
bills
said,
the
key
point
is
whether
or
not
federal
power
can
effectively
stop
the
states
from
changing
their
voting
laws
for
discriminatory
purposes,
that
is
the
only
issue.
best
of
all
congressman
mcculloch,
put
it
in
a
nutshell
what
the
importance
of
the
section
5
was
and
how
it
had
to
work.
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
about
whether
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
compliance
or
a
small
degree
of
compliance.
there
had
been
at
that
time
some
400
enactments
or
changes
submitted
to
the
justice
department.
congressman
mcculloch
said,
it's
on
page
12136,
the
pre-clearance
procedure,
and
this
is
critical,
serves
psychologically
to
control
the
proliferation
of
discriminatory
laws
and
practices
because
each
change
must
first
be
federally
reviewed.
thus,
section
5
serves
to
prevent
discrimination
before
it
starts.
that
psychological
effect,
the
idea
of
creating
an
incentive
to
jurisdictions
to
comply
was
repeatedly
stated,
senator
kennedy
said
it,
congressman
ryan
said
it,
senator
bayh
said
it,
senator
tydings
said
it.
if
the
court
wishes,
i
can
supply
these
citations,
but
it
is
combed
through
the
hearings
and
combed
through
the
debates
on
the
floor.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
conceivable
way
to
carry
out
that
affect,
that
is
to
create
that
incentive
and
to
make
it
strong,
unless
section
5
carries
an
advantage
for
obeying
it
and
a
disadvantage
for
disobeying
it.
and
i
think
its
clear
and
congress,
i
think
certainly
meant
this
to
be
the
case
that
if
all
you
do
when
you
lose
a
case
is
go
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general,
you
have
not
suffered
a
disadvantage
and
there
is
no
conceivable
incentive
created
to
submit
laws
in
the
future.
it's
clear
that
in
this
situation
congress
meant
section
5
to
be
as
effective
as
possible.
senator
hart
made
it
very
plain.
he
said,
“we
don't
have
enough
successes
around
here
to
be
wasteful
of
them.
condition
of
this
country
argues
very
strong
that
we
manage
to
develop
an
instrument
effective
to
enable
us
to
deliver
on
promises
of
long
standing,
we
had
better
not
dilute
it.”
the
question
of
the
remedy
is
inseparable
from
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
congress
meant
section
5
to
carry
with
it
a
remedy
that
would
make
the
hopes
of
congress
in
passing
section
5
fully
effective.
the
only
possible
remedy
is
a
remedy
that
says,
“if
you
do
not
submit,
you
do
not
have
a
valid
law.”
mr.
armand
derfner
because
in
allen,
we
dealt
as
i
say
with
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
first
temptation
of
course
specifically
said,
complex
issues
of
first
impression.
in
this
case
it's
not
a
question
of
first
impression,
they
are
not
complex
issues.
the
act
has
been
in
effect
for
five
years
now,
that
this
is
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
this
is
post
allen,
the
case
arose
post
allen,
the
election
took
place
post
allen.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
it
would
be
fair
for
this
court
to
say
that
i
think
--
well,
i
think
that's
what
the
court
did
say
in
allen,
and
i
think
what
it
was
saying
is
that
no
elections
that
took
place
before
the
decision
in
allen
can
now
be
over
turned,
and
i
think
in
fact
the
general
rule
in
elections
would
indicate
that
you
can
not
overturn
any
elections
that
have
taken
place
in
the
past.
i
think
by
the
way,
that
would
not
indicate
that
you
can't
challenge
changes
that
have
been
made
in
the
past.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
would
be
here
on
the
other
two
changes,
i
certainly
would.
the
65
election
was
not
held
as
a
62
law
requires.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
record
here
doesn't
show,
yes
it's
in
violation,
record
here
doesn't
show
why
they
held
the
65
election
--
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me?
mr.
armand
derfner
we
were
not
told
why
was
--
we
never
told
in
the
record.
frankly
it
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
their
degree
of
compliance
are
not
with
the
law.
it's
a
matter
for
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
take
up
or
the
attorney
general
to
take
up
on
the
question
of
motive.
i
know
that
in
1969,
they
were
going
to
hold
the
election
in
different
way
from
the
1965.
it's
up
to
them
to
show
why
they
want
to
change
it
or
why
they
did
what
they
did
in
1965.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
would.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
would
want
that
election
law.
i
want
that
election
law
frozen
unless
they
could
justify
it
as
was
done
in
u.s.
versus
louisiana,
and
is
a
traditional
doctrine
in
voting
cases.
if
you
violate
a
law
in
the
past,
that
law
is
frozen,
at
least
in
fifteenth
amendment
cases
and
section
5
goes
to
the
very
limits
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
is
intended
to
carry
with
it,
all
the
possible
force
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
it
is
very
well
said,
both
from
administrative
practice
and
for
legislative
history.
there
are
any
number
of
citations,
and
i
give
the
court
those
if
the
court
likes
in
which
polling
places
and
the
boundary
extensions
were
mentioned
as
being
the
kinds
of
things
that
come
within
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
complaint
states
and
the
answer,
i
think
admits
that
the
polling
places
through
--
for
the
1965
elections
were
the
same
as
they
had
been
in
the
previous
three
or
four
elections.
mr.
armand
derfner
first
general
municipal
election
change.
there
had
been
a
bond
issue
election
the
previous
year
i
believe
in
which
there
were
some
changes
and
some
not.
mr.
armand
derfner
you
mean
the
changes
after
november
1,
1964
which
the
section
5
talks
about?
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
the
change
from
ward
elections
to
at-large
as
warding,
you
have
mentioned
that
justice
brennan.
the
other
changes
are
the
change
in
the
polling
places.
mr.
armand
derfner
just
by
the
election
commissioner
saying
these
would
be
the
polling
places.
mr.
armand
derfner
and
the
other
change
is
the
boundary
expansion.
mr.
armand
derfner
and
those
were
made
by
the
city
in
--
through
chancery
court
decree,
but
without
hearing
them.
mr.
armand
derfner
under
a
state
statute
allowing
cities
to
expand
by
going
to
chancery
court.
mr.
armand
derfner
quite
some
and
on
the
change--
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
all
i
need
is
one
of
three
and
then
the
question
becomes
as
i
said
one
of
relief.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
some
specific
material.
mr.
armand
derfner
there
are
four
wards
in
the
city
of
canton.
there
is
one
polling
place
in
each
ward.
there
are
four
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
there
is
not.
wards
one
and
two
are
heavily
white
and
basically
there
is
not
much
complaint
about
those
changes.
wards
three
and
four
are
heavily
black
and
that
is
where
the
polling
places
were
changed
in
one
case
to
an
old
jail,
in
the
other
case
moved
from
middle
of
the
black
neighborhood
to
an
area
right
adjacent
to
a
newly
annexed
white
neighborhood.
mr.
armand
derfner
they
were
not.
mr.
armand
derfner
quite
so
and
under
section
5,
i
would
say
that
failing
to
get
the
consent
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
i
would
say
that
failing
to
do
those
things
is
as
fatal
to
the
law
as
failing
to
get
the
governor's
signature
on
a
bill.
it
is
an
integral
part.
section
5
makes
these
procedures
integral
parts
of
the
validity
of
any
enactment
or
any
change
that
a
state
covers
state
or
subdivision
--
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
as
your
honor,
has
made
quite
claim
in
two
previous
decisions,
it
applies
to
the
states
covered
under
the
formula
which
happened
to
include
your
state,
i
am
afraid.
i
would
like
to
refer
specifically
to
the
colloquy
between
mr.
norman
and
senator
bayh
in
the
senate
hearings.
the
critical
portion
is
at
page
520
of
the
senate
hearings.
mr.
armand
derfner
this
is
not
in
the
brief,
i
am
afraid.
and
basically
mr.
norman
at
that
point
was
saying
--
had
just
said,
“all
you
win,
if
you
win
a
section
5
case
is
that
the
city
or
state
or
what
have
you
has
to
go
submit
the
law
to
the
attorney
general.”
senator
bayh
said
--
he
was
talking
about,
“it
is
an
easy
case
to
prove,
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
to
prove
actual
discrimination.”
mr.
norman
says,
“in
the
example
that
you
gave,
if
indeed
a
court
would
enter
an
order
based
on
my
proof
that
we
objected,
that
is
objected
to
the
enactment,
that
is
all
the
proof
that
would
be
put
in,
that
would
be
an
easier
burden
of
proof
than
proving
discrimination,
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
think
a
court
would
do
that."
there
i
think
it
is
clear
that
mr.
normal
is
talking
about
a
court
not
being
willing
to
give
any
relief
beyond
requiring
submission.
senator
bayh
says,
“is
it
necessary
for
me
to
read
the
words
of
section
5
to
take
issue
with
our
distinguished
witness
as
to
whether
the
court
would
be
violating
the
words
on
the
intent
of
section
5
if
it
held
the
courts
that
you
suggested.”
mr.
norman
said,
“no,
if
we
went
to
court
and
filed
the
paper
and
said
we
objected
to
this,
they
threaten
to
use
it
anyway,
please
enjoy
them
using
it.
it
is
not
inconceivable
to
me
that
a
court
would
say,
that
was
right,
why
did
you
object?
what
was
wrong
with
it?”
talking
about
requiring
this
thing
to
be
submitted.
senator
bayh
says,
“but
the
law
says
whether
the
court
makes
the
inquiry
or
not,
if
that
ruling
or
regulation
or
change
has
not
been
submitted
to
you
on
its
face,
it
is
invalid.”
now,
that
is
what
it
says
right
here
in
the
words
of
section
5,
i
won't
bother
to
prolong
the
hearing
by
reading
that,
but
that
is
what
it
says.
i
think
the
position
--
the
lines
are
quite
clearly
drawn,
they
were
quite
clearly
drawn
in
the
debates
over
--
overextending
the
act.
the
justice
department
took
the
position
that
the
only
relief
to
be
allowed
was
requiring
submission.
the
senate
and
the
house
quite
clearly
understood
that,
that
would
gut
the
act
and
they
quite
clearly
rejected
that
position.
now,
i
think
it
takes
no
great
difficulty
to
see
that
if
the
only
relief
to
be
gained
is
requiring
submission
to
the
attorney
general,
if
the
only
thing
that
the
appellants
in
this
case
can
gain
by
spending
$3000
or
$4000
and
how
many
hours
on
a
lawsuit
is
when
they
win
two
years
later
to
have
the
city
submit
its
changes,
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
private
suits.
justice
coleman
has
already
indicated
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
justice
department
suits
for
simple
violation
of
section
5.
i
think
congress
recognized
all
of
those
things.
i
might
add
there
were
a
number
of
other
references
in
the
debates,
references
to
the
hadnott
versus
amos
case
and
to
a
more
recent
case
filed
by
the
justice
department
called
united
states
against
democratic
executive
committee
of
wilcox
county
in
which
--
mr.
armand
derfner
allen
did
by
implication
because
--
mr.
armand
derfner
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
not,
but
it
did
hit
the
--
it
did
say
that
diluting
a
person's
vote
or
effecting
the
strength
of
his
vote
is
covered
by
changing
in
that
case
from
ward
to
at-large
or
beat
to
at-large.
there
is
--
it
seems
to
me
clear
for
example
that
drawing
in
the
boundaries
to
cut
out
black
votes
would
be
covered
and
i
think
the
allen
case
very
readily
reads
and
has
been
so
construed
by
both
congress
and
the
administrators
to
mean
that
if
you
add
x
number
of
white
voters
and
therefore
dilute
the
effectiveness
of
any
given
voter,
especially
black
voter
who
is
already
in
the
city
that
you
have
affected
his
right
to
vote
and
you
have
denied
his
right
to
vote
under
section
5,
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
quite
clearly.
the
election
results
--
both
primary
and
general
election
are
not
in
the
record
because
the
elections
took
place
after
the
case
was
closed,
but
the
figures
are
not
in
dispute
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
blacks
would
have
won
because
they
got
more
votes
in
both
wards
three
and
four.
mr.
armand
derfner
it
is
hard
to
tell.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
those
figures
are
wrong.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
do.
the
district
court
said
that
at
the
time
the
annexations
were
taken
in
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
you
should
take
the
figures
that
can
be
gained
from
the
record
and
the
exhibits
at
the
very
back
of
the
appendix
show
how
many
people
were
actually
counted
there
by
the
city's
enumerator.
they
had
a
man
go
out
mr.
smith,
who
was
a
witness
at
the
trial.
go
out
and
count
houses
and
count
people,
and
based
on
that,
you
can
figure
out
exactly
how
many
people
were
there.
district
court
made
it
quite
clear
it
was
talking
about
how
many
people
had
been
brought
in
at
the
time
of
annexation,
not
how
many
people
would
be
affected
at
the
time
of
the
election.
i
think
the
time
of
the
election
is
the
critical
part.
mr.
armand
derfner
you
would
have
a
net
of
approximately
250
or
more
extra
whites.
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
true,
but
it
is
not
thought
to
be
contrary
to
what
the
record
says.
mr.
armand
derfner
that
itself
might
not
have
made
a
difference,
would
not
have
made
a
difference
because
without
the
--
except
for
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
general
margin
in
the
general
election
was
some
800
votes
for
most
of
the
offices.
it
was
somewhat
less
than
that
in
the
primary
elections.
if
you
take
together
the
annexations
and
the
moving
of
the
polling
places
and
i
think
by
the
way
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
turn
out
in
ward
three,
you
will
see
that
it's
significantly
below
than
the
turn
out
in
the
other
wards,
ward
four
is
also
below.
if
you
take
the
moving
of
the
polling
place
plus
the
annexations,
i
think
you
will
find
that
there
is
enough
of
a
probability
that
a
change
would
have
taken
place,
so
that
this
court
should
--
so
that
a
new
election
would
be
fair,
would
be
equitable,
because
we're
not
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
a
change
in
the
results
was
a
(inaudible)
talking
about
and
remember
that
in
some
cases
as
in
bell
against
southwell,
you
do
not
need
any
effect
on
the
results.
we
are
talking
though
about
a
situation
in
which
the
results
could
well
have
been
changed.
mr.
armand
derfner
frankly,
your
honor,
if
--
when
i
had
been
here
in
allen
and
when
mr.
mcilwaine
had
been
here
in
allen,
if
we
had
thought
that's
--
that
the
court
meant
that
to
apply
beyond
the
allen
case,
we
would
not
have
brought
anymore
section
5
cases,
and
there
wouldn't
be
anymore
section
5.
this
is
just
not
worth
anything
if
it
doesn't
mean
a
new
election.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
with
the
short
life
for
the
act,
it
certainly
won't,
it
won't
mean
enough
to
make
a
difference.
at
the
time
we
brought
this
cases,
the
act
was
due
to
expire
in
a
year.
now
it's
been
extended
for
five
more.
there'd
be
one
more
municipal
election
under
these
terms.
frankly,
a
totally
perspective
ruling
just
doesn't
have
the
value
that
congress
meant
it
to
have.
mr.
armand
derfner
if
he
had
consented,
when?
mr.
armand
derfner
you
mean
before
the
election.
mr.
armand
derfner
certainly,
it
would
have.
well,
i
take
it
back,
it
would
have
been
valid
under
section
5.
we
still
would
attack
it
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armand
derfner
under
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
just
state
a
brief,
like
we
stated
in
response
to
questions
posed
in
slightly
different
force
by
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
harlan.
basically
the
question
was
how
can
you
expect
or
how
were
the
apportionment
fair
under
reynolds
against
sims
or
how
were
the
ward
elections
and
mr.
marshall's
question
was
relating
to
the
expansion
of
boundaries.
i
think
basically
what
section
5
had
said
is
that
--
is
that
the
certainty
that
these
are
valid
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
that
these
have
been
passed
in
good
faith
is
so
important
that
section
5
must
be
enforced
that
way.
but
these
are
not
questions
to
be
considered,
nor
even
that
we
have
to
make
any
proof
on
in
the
record
below
and
that
as
to
the
apportionment,
a
slight
dislocation
in
the
question
of
proper
apportionment
of
one
election
is
not
of
such
consequence,
will
not
dislocate
the
law
as
much
as
allowing
a
change
to
pass
without
proper
clearance
under
section
5,
which
if
it
happened,
would
create
every
incentive
for
every
jurisdiction,
never
to
submit
another
change
under
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
acts
of
1965
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
a
fourth
such
appeal
in
three
terms
of
court.
first
three
having
decided
by
this
court,
reversing
the
lower
court
in
the
case
of
allen
versus
state
board
of
elections.
i
believe
the
question
on
the
merits
here
is
quite
simple
and
i
plan
to
devote
about
a
small
portion
of
the
argument
in
demonstrating
the
court
below
was
wrong
on
all
three
of
the
questions
that
it
faced.
the
vital
question
in
this
case
is
a
question
for
relief
and
that
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
whether
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
acts
of
1965
is
to
be
permitted
to
occupy
the
critical
place
that
congress
intended
for
it
in
1965
and
reaffirmed
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
when
it
extended
the
act
in
1970.
to
advert
very
briefly
to
the
facts,
the
city
of
canton
in
mississippi
for
its
municipal
elections
in
1969
adopted
three
changes
from
the
procedure
that
it
had
governed
the
prior
municipal
election
in
1965.
they
went
from
individual
board
elections
to
at
large
elections
in
a
town
in
which
there
are
two
wards
that
are
very
heavily
black.
they
moved
the
polling
places,
in
one
case
from
the
town
square
to
an
old
jail
and
in
another
case
from
the
middle
of
the
black
neighborhood
and
heavily
black
ward
to
a
point
just
adjacent
to
a
newly
annexed
white
neighborhood,
and
third,
they
extended
the
boundaries
of
the
town
in
such
a
way
as
to
add
several
hundred
net
additional
white
residents,
that
is
several
hundred
more
white
residents
than
black
residents.
mr.
armand
derfner
wards,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
are
3
and
4
and
my
brief
gives,
i
believe
the
record
too
gives
the
registration
figures
for
all
the
wards.
all
these
changes
are
familiar
ones.
they
are
all
changes
of
the
type
that
had
been
submitted
by
other
jurisdictions
to
the
attorney
general
as
can
be
shown
by
looking
at
page
309
of
the
house
hearings.
they
are
all
changes
of
the
type
that
congress
mentioned
many,
many
times
in
the
debates
in
1969
and
1970
on
the
extension.
the
best
example
of
that
is
perhaps
congressman
mcculloch
who
was
perhaps
the
leading
minority
member
in
the
house,
involved
both
in
the
1965
act
and
1970
extension.
he
was
in
each
of
these
three
kinds
of
changes
as
types
they
were
covered
by
the
voting
by
section
5.
judge
nixon,
the
single
judge,
on
the
basis
of
the
boundary
extension
alone
granted
an
injunction
against
having
the
election.
the
case
then
went
forward
and
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court
which
held
without
quite
saying
ever,
without
saying
actually
that
any
of
these
changes
that
was
not
covered
by
section
5,
it
went
into
the
motives
of
the
changes
which
this
court
has
conclusively
held
are
to
be
decided
only
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
and
pronounced
these
changes
did
not
violate
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
of
course
we
do.
what
i
am
saying,
however
is
that,
that
is
not
a
question
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
this
court
in
the
allen
case
made
it
clear
and
i
think
justice
harlan
asked
that
precise
question
there
that
that
is
not
a
question
we
have
to
decide
now
or
have
to
prove.
all
we
have
to
prove
is,
if
there
was
a
change
and
there
is
an
adequate
procedure
set
up
by
section
5
to
determine
what
the
good
faith
or
lack
thereof
was.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
in
fact,
it
doesn't
even
have
to
alter
these
lines
invidiously.
all
it
has
to
do
is
alter
these
lines
and
at
that
point
congress
says
that
is
a
matter
that
you
cannot
take
up
any
place,
but
with
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
ends
the
matter
in
a
section
5
case.
the
court
below
had
only
to
decide
as
judge
nixon
said
when
he
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order,
i
have
to
decide,
was
there
a
change?
the
answer
is,
yes.
was
it
submitted?
the
answer
is,
no.
at
that
point
the
matter
is
taken
out
of
my
hands
and
the
election
cannot
go
forward
on
this
basis.
mr.
armand
derfner
certainly,
we
wouldn't
be
suing
on
meaningless
cases.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
believe
they
did
not
cite.
they
were
certainly
aware
of
it,
it
in
fact
having
come
from
--
well
three
of
those
cases
having
come
from
that
same
court.
so
i
say
that
the
merits
are
easy
question.
the
vital
question
is
what
is
the
relief
to
be
given
in
this
case,
and
on
a
very
simple
plain,
that
is
an
easy
question
too.
the
very
simple
plain
says
there
must
be
a
new
election,
and
we
maintain
there
must
be
a
new
election
and
that
there
can't
be
any
question
about
that.
the
law
is
clear
in
election
cases,
in
the
cases
such
as
hamer
versus
campbell
in
the
fifth
circuit,
united
states
versus
barbara
county,
a
case
in
the
district
court.
cases
such
as
hadnott
versus
amos
for
that
example,
that
if
you
assert
you
remedies
in
timely
fashion
in
a
voting
case,
particularly,
in
a
fifteenth
amendment
case,
but
certainly
equally
well
in
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
such
as
a
property
tax
cases
or
more
recently
apportionment
cases,
then
if
it
develops
after
the
election
has
being
held
--
that
you
didn't
get
the
relief
and
election
is
held.
if
it
develops
thereafter
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
an
injunction,
that
you
are
entitled
to
have
the
election
set
aside.
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
am
not
certain
that
this
court
has
done
that.
this
court
has
certainly
indicated
that
could
be
done
and
lower
courts
have
done
it.
i
know
that
fifth
circuit
has
done
it
in
the
case
coming
from
monroe
county,
mississippi.
mr.
armand
derfner
this
court
has
refused
to
do
it.
in
allen,
if
you
are
talking
about
this
case,
this
court
said
specifically
that
these
section
5
question,
coverage
questions
involve
complex
issues
of
first
impression.
issues
subject
to
rationale
disagreement.
the
state
enactments
were
not
so
clearly
subject
to
section
5
and
so
forth.
therefore,
we
give
only
prospective
affect
to
our
decision.
i
think
that
was
a
clear
indication
as
clear
--
perhaps
as
clear
as
the
indication
as
the
explicit
language
in
the
tax
cases
that
thenceforward,
jurisdiction
would
have
been
on
notice
that
if
they
didn't
submit
the
proper
remedy
was
a
new
election.
and
that
is
a
traditional,
as
i
say,
basically
it's
come
to
be
a
traditional
equitable
remedy
in
election
cases
and
i
think
that
the
ordinary
rule
there
would
be
that
there
should
a
new
election
unless
there
are
special
circumstances.
there
were
special
circumstances
in
allen
as
they
are
often
are
when
a
court,
and
this
court
especially
decides
a
case
involving
a
whole
new
body
of
law.
there
are
no
special
circumstances
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
reason
that
the
city
of
canton
has
advanced
or
could
advance
for
why
it
should
not
be
governed
by
the
general
rule.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
terms
are
four
years.
they
were
to
have
begun
in
july
of
1969.
they
will
close
in
july
of
1973.
the
election
in
this
case
did
take
place
in
october,
the
primaries
and
the
general
election
in
october,
1969.
the
basic
question,
and
this
is
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
as
to
that
particular
--
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
but
a
couple
of
them
were
public
places.
i
think
two
of
them
--
at
least
one
of
them
was
in
a
court
house
and
the
other
one
was
also
the
public
place.
i
certainly
admit
that
there
would
in
some
cases
have
to
be
an
impossibility
exception
indicating
that
there
might
have
be
a
change
and
if
that
was
so,
if
the
city
could
come
forward
and
show
that
it
was
totally
impossible,
not
simply
impractical
or
inadvisable,
but
impossible
to
hold
an
election
in
a
certain
place
or
impossible
to
do
a
certain
thing,
then
they
could
submit
that
to
the
attorney
general,
get
a
quick
approval
and
put
that
change
into
effect.
i
would
limit
that
to
the
very
barest
minimum
in
impossibility
cases.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
precisely
the
difficult
question
facing
this
court
and
that's
precisely
the
answer
i
give,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
not
be
allowed
to
vote.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
the
new
election
must
take
place
immediately
or
within
30
or
60
days.
only
as
much
time
as
is
required
to
prepare
ballots
and
do
the
things
that
are
necessary
for
a
election,
get
out
notice
and
so
forth
and
that
election
must
be
conducted
under
the
rules
that
applied
at
--
under
the
valid
rules
that
applied
at
the
time
the
election
should
have
taken
place.
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
correct,
and
if
i
may
just
take
a
few
moments,
i
will
explain
precisely
why
i
take
that
position.
the
short
answer,
why
that
position
must
be
taken
is
if
any
other
position
is
taken,
there
will
be
no
section
5
in
the
act.
section
5
will
have
become
almost
totally
meaningless.
the
only
change
it
will
have
resulted
in
is
a
significant
change,
yes,
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
in
some
of
this
cases.
mr.
armand
derfner
at
least
as
good
and
no
better
and
the
declaratory
judgment
doesn't
give
us
a
new
election.
quite
frankly,
i
think
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
the
advantage
of
a
congress
that
in
1969
and
1970
debated
extensively,
several
100
pages
of
a
congressional
record
and
at
least
1200
to
1500
pages
of
hearings
of
reports,
what
should
happen
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement,
that
the
bulk
of
that
debate
aside
from
question
such
--
involving
new
question
such
as
the
general
banning
of
the
literacy
test
and
the
18-year
old
vote
and
the
residence
and
absentee
provision,
the
bulk
of
the
argument
dealt
with
section
5
and
the
debate
is
replete
with
discussion
over
the
importance
of
section
5.
basically
the
history
is
quite
clear,
a
bill
was
introduced
which
i
believe
the
record
would
show
had
administration
backing,
the
justice
department
testified
for
it,
a
bill
was
introduced
which
would
have
abolished
the
pre-clearance
procedures
of
section
5.
this
bill
was
supported
in
critical
testimony
by
the
attorney
general
and
especially
by
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
david
norman.
in
his
testimony,
it
appears
at
pages
500
and
following
of
the
senate
hearings.
at
those
hearings,
both
the
attorney
general
and
mr.
norman
testified
explicitly
that
section
--
that
there
was
no
need
for
section
5
because
in
fact
all
section
5
did
was
to
provide
the
following
remedy.
this
is
explicitly
stated
by
mr.
norman,
section
5
provides
only
the
remedy
that
if
you
win
a
section
5
case,
then
the
jurisdiction
that
didn't
submit
the
matter
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
of
columbia
court
must
then
submit
it.
i
think
the
congressional
debates
and
the
outcome
of
what
happened
in
congress
is
as
clear
reputation
of
that
position
as
is
possible
to
take.
and
if
i
might
just,
at
this
point
discuss
very
briefly
the
legislative
history,
and
i
might
say
that
much
of
this
is
not
specifically
cited
in
the
brief.
there
were
numerous
statements
in
congress
dealing
with
the
importance
of
section
5.
there
was
no
report
from
the
senate
judiciary
committee
or
from
any
subcommittee
because
the
bill
had
been
submitted,
the
extension
bill
had
been
submitted
under
rule
requiring
a
report
or
requiring
to
be
reported
out
by
april
1st,
there
was
no
time
for
a
report.
there
was
however
a
joint
statement
signed
by
ten
senators
who
constituted
the
majority
of
the
17.
this
report
is
in
the
congressional
record
and
is
at
pages
2756
and
following.
it's
a
monthly
report,
discusses
section
5
in
great
detail
and
has
three
italicized
sentences
throughout
the
whole
report,
each
of
which
italicized
sentences
refers
to
section
5.
as
an
example,
this
section,
it's
on
page
2756,
this
section
in
effect
freezes
election
procedures
in
the
covered
areas
unless
the
changes
can
be
shown
to
be
non-discriminatory.
there
were
other
even
more
explicit
statements
representative
corman
(ph)
in
discussing
the
differences
between
the
two
bills
said,
the
key
point
is
whether
or
not
federal
power
can
effectively
stop
the
states
from
changing
their
voting
laws
for
discriminatory
purposes,
that
is
the
only
issue.
best
of
all
congressman
mcculloch,
put
it
in
a
nutshell
what
the
importance
of
the
section
5
was
and
how
it
had
to
work.
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
about
whether
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
compliance
or
a
small
degree
of
compliance.
there
had
been
at
that
time
some
400
enactments
or
changes
submitted
to
the
justice
department.
congressman
mcculloch
said,
it's
on
page
12136,
the
pre-clearance
procedure,
and
this
is
critical,
serves
psychologically
to
control
the
proliferation
of
discriminatory
laws
and
practices
because
each
change
must
first
be
federally
reviewed.
thus,
section
5
serves
to
prevent
discrimination
before
it
starts.
that
psychological
effect,
the
idea
of
creating
an
incentive
to
jurisdictions
to
comply
was
repeatedly
stated,
senator
kennedy
said
it,
congressman
ryan
said
it,
senator
bayh
said
it,
senator
tydings
said
it.
if
the
court
wishes,
i
can
supply
these
citations,
but
it
is
combed
through
the
hearings
and
combed
through
the
debates
on
the
floor.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
conceivable
way
to
carry
out
that
affect,
that
is
to
create
that
incentive
and
to
make
it
strong,
unless
section
5
carries
an
advantage
for
obeying
it
and
a
disadvantage
for
disobeying
it.
and
i
think
its
clear
and
congress,
i
think
certainly
meant
this
to
be
the
case
that
if
all
you
do
when
you
lose
a
case
is
go
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general,
you
have
not
suffered
a
disadvantage
and
there
is
no
conceivable
incentive
created
to
submit
laws
in
the
future.
it's
clear
that
in
this
situation
congress
meant
section
5
to
be
as
effective
as
possible.
senator
hart
made
it
very
plain.
he
said,
“we
don't
have
enough
successes
around
here
to
be
wasteful
of
them.
condition
of
this
country
argues
very
strong
that
we
manage
to
develop
an
instrument
effective
to
enable
us
to
deliver
on
promises
of
long
standing,
we
had
better
not
dilute
it.”
the
question
of
the
remedy
is
inseparable
from
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
congress
meant
section
5
to
carry
with
it
a
remedy
that
would
make
the
hopes
of
congress
in
passing
section
5
fully
effective.
the
only
possible
remedy
is
a
remedy
that
says,
“if
you
do
not
submit,
you
do
not
have
a
valid
law.”
mr.
armand
derfner
because
in
allen,
we
dealt
as
i
say
with
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
first
temptation
of
course
specifically
said,
complex
issues
of
first
impression.
in
this
case
it's
not
a
question
of
first
impression,
they
are
not
complex
issues.
the
act
has
been
in
effect
for
five
years
now,
that
this
is
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
this
is
post
allen,
the
case
arose
post
allen,
the
election
took
place
post
allen.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
it
would
be
fair
for
this
court
to
say
that
i
think
--
well,
i
think
that's
what
the
court
did
say
in
allen,
and
i
think
what
it
was
saying
is
that
no
elections
that
took
place
before
the
decision
in
allen
can
now
be
over
turned,
and
i
think
in
fact
the
general
rule
in
elections
would
indicate
that
you
can
not
overturn
any
elections
that
have
taken
place
in
the
past.
i
think
by
the
way,
that
would
not
indicate
that
you
can't
challenge
changes
that
have
been
made
in
the
past.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
would
be
here
on
the
other
two
changes,
i
certainly
would.
the
65
election
was
not
held
as
a
62
law
requires.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
record
here
doesn't
show,
yes
it's
in
violation,
record
here
doesn't
show
why
they
held
the
65
election
--
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me?
mr.
armand
derfner
we
were
not
told
why
was
--
we
never
told
in
the
record.
frankly
it
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
their
degree
of
compliance
are
not
with
the
law.
it's
a
matter
for
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
take
up
or
the
attorney
general
to
take
up
on
the
question
of
motive.
i
know
that
in
1969,
they
were
going
to
hold
the
election
in
different
way
from
the
1965.
it's
up
to
them
to
show
why
they
want
to
change
it
or
why
they
did
what
they
did
in
1965.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
would.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
would
want
that
election
law.
i
want
that
election
law
frozen
unless
they
could
justify
it
as
was
done
in
u.s.
versus
louisiana,
and
is
a
traditional
doctrine
in
voting
cases.
if
you
violate
a
law
in
the
past,
that
law
is
frozen,
at
least
in
fifteenth
amendment
cases
and
section
5
goes
to
the
very
limits
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
is
intended
to
carry
with
it,
all
the
possible
force
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
it
is
very
well
said,
both
from
administrative
practice
and
for
legislative
history.
there
are
any
number
of
citations,
and
i
give
the
court
those
if
the
court
likes
in
which
polling
places
and
the
boundary
extensions
were
mentioned
as
being
the
kinds
of
things
that
come
within
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
complaint
states
and
the
answer,
i
think
admits
that
the
polling
places
through
--
for
the
1965
elections
were
the
same
as
they
had
been
in
the
previous
three
or
four
elections.
mr.
armand
derfner
first
general
municipal
election
change.
there
had
been
a
bond
issue
election
the
previous
year
i
believe
in
which
there
were
some
changes
and
some
not.
mr.
armand
derfner
you
mean
the
changes
after
november
1,
1964
which
the
section
5
talks
about?
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
the
change
from
ward
elections
to
at-large
as
warding,
you
have
mentioned
that
justice
brennan.
the
other
changes
are
the
change
in
the
polling
places.
mr.
armand
derfner
just
by
the
election
commissioner
saying
these
would
be
the
polling
places.
mr.
armand
derfner
and
the
other
change
is
the
boundary
expansion.
mr.
armand
derfner
and
those
were
made
by
the
city
in
--
through
chancery
court
decree,
but
without
hearing
them.
mr.
armand
derfner
under
a
state
statute
allowing
cities
to
expand
by
going
to
chancery
court.
mr.
armand
derfner
quite
some
and
on
the
change--
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
all
i
need
is
one
of
three
and
then
the
question
becomes
as
i
said
one
of
relief.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
some
specific
material.
mr.
armand
derfner
there
are
four
wards
in
the
city
of
canton.
there
is
one
polling
place
in
each
ward.
there
are
four
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
there
is
not.
wards
one
and
two
are
heavily
white
and
basically
there
is
not
much
complaint
about
those
changes.
wards
three
and
four
are
heavily
black
and
that
is
where
the
polling
places
were
changed
in
one
case
to
an
old
jail,
in
the
other
case
moved
from
middle
of
the
black
neighborhood
to
an
area
right
adjacent
to
a
newly
annexed
white
neighborhood.
mr.
armand
derfner
they
were
not.
mr.
armand
derfner
quite
so
and
under
section
5,
i
would
say
that
failing
to
get
the
consent
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
i
would
say
that
failing
to
do
those
things
is
as
fatal
to
the
law
as
failing
to
get
the
governor's
signature
on
a
bill.
it
is
an
integral
part.
section
5
makes
these
procedures
integral
parts
of
the
validity
of
any
enactment
or
any
change
that
a
state
covers
state
or
subdivision
--
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
as
your
honor,
has
made
quite
claim
in
two
previous
decisions,
it
applies
to
the
states
covered
under
the
formula
which
happened
to
include
your
state,
i
am
afraid.
i
would
like
to
refer
specifically
to
the
colloquy
between
mr.
norman
and
senator
bayh
in
the
senate
hearings.
the
critical
portion
is
at
page
520
of
the
senate
hearings.
mr.
armand
derfner
this
is
not
in
the
brief,
i
am
afraid.
and
basically
mr.
norman
at
that
point
was
saying
--
had
just
said,
“all
you
win,
if
you
win
a
section
5
case
is
that
the
city
or
state
or
what
have
you
has
to
go
submit
the
law
to
the
attorney
general.”
senator
bayh
said
--
he
was
talking
about,
“it
is
an
easy
case
to
prove,
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
to
prove
actual
discrimination.”
mr.
norman
says,
“in
the
example
that
you
gave,
if
indeed
a
court
would
enter
an
order
based
on
my
proof
that
we
objected,
that
is
objected
to
the
enactment,
that
is
all
the
proof
that
would
be
put
in,
that
would
be
an
easier
burden
of
proof
than
proving
discrimination,
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
think
a
court
would
do
that."
there
i
think
it
is
clear
that
mr.
normal
is
talking
about
a
court
not
being
willing
to
give
any
relief
beyond
requiring
submission.
senator
bayh
says,
“is
it
necessary
for
me
to
read
the
words
of
section
5
to
take
issue
with
our
distinguished
witness
as
to
whether
the
court
would
be
violating
the
words
on
the
intent
of
section
5
if
it
held
the
courts
that
you
suggested.”
mr.
norman
said,
“no,
if
we
went
to
court
and
filed
the
paper
and
said
we
objected
to
this,
they
threaten
to
use
it
anyway,
please
enjoy
them
using
it.
it
is
not
inconceivable
to
me
that
a
court
would
say,
that
was
right,
why
did
you
object?
what
was
wrong
with
it?”
talking
about
requiring
this
thing
to
be
submitted.
senator
bayh
says,
“but
the
law
says
whether
the
court
makes
the
inquiry
or
not,
if
that
ruling
or
regulation
or
change
has
not
been
submitted
to
you
on
its
face,
it
is
invalid.”
now,
that
is
what
it
says
right
here
in
the
words
of
section
5,
i
won't
bother
to
prolong
the
hearing
by
reading
that,
but
that
is
what
it
says.
i
think
the
position
--
the
lines
are
quite
clearly
drawn,
they
were
quite
clearly
drawn
in
the
debates
over
--
overextending
the
act.
the
justice
department
took
the
position
that
the
only
relief
to
be
allowed
was
requiring
submission.
the
senate
and
the
house
quite
clearly
understood
that,
that
would
gut
the
act
and
they
quite
clearly
rejected
that
position.
now,
i
think
it
takes
no
great
difficulty
to
see
that
if
the
only
relief
to
be
gained
is
requiring
submission
to
the
attorney
general,
if
the
only
thing
that
the
appellants
in
this
case
can
gain
by
spending
$3000
or
$4000
and
how
many
hours
on
a
lawsuit
is
when
they
win
two
years
later
to
have
the
city
submit
its
changes,
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
private
suits.
justice
coleman
has
already
indicated
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
justice
department
suits
for
simple
violation
of
section
5.
i
think
congress
recognized
all
of
those
things.
i
might
add
there
were
a
number
of
other
references
in
the
debates,
references
to
the
hadnott
versus
amos
case
and
to
a
more
recent
case
filed
by
the
justice
department
called
united
states
against
democratic
executive
committee
of
wilcox
county
in
which
--
mr.
armand
derfner
allen
did
by
implication
because
--
mr.
armand
derfner
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
not,
but
it
did
hit
the
--
it
did
say
that
diluting
a
person's
vote
or
effecting
the
strength
of
his
vote
is
covered
by
changing
in
that
case
from
ward
to
at-large
or
beat
to
at-large.
there
is
--
it
seems
to
me
clear
for
example
that
drawing
in
the
boundaries
to
cut
out
black
votes
would
be
covered
and
i
think
the
allen
case
very
readily
reads
and
has
been
so
construed
by
both
congress
and
the
administrators
to
mean
that
if
you
add
x
number
of
white
voters
and
therefore
dilute
the
effectiveness
of
any
given
voter,
especially
black
voter
who
is
already
in
the
city
that
you
have
affected
his
right
to
vote
and
you
have
denied
his
right
to
vote
under
section
5,
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
quite
clearly.
the
election
results
--
both
primary
and
general
election
are
not
in
the
record
because
the
elections
took
place
after
the
case
was
closed,
but
the
figures
are
not
in
dispute
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
blacks
would
have
won
because
they
got
more
votes
in
both
wards
three
and
four.
mr.
armand
derfner
it
is
hard
to
tell.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
those
figures
are
wrong.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
do.
the
district
court
said
that
at
the
time
the
annexations
were
taken
in
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
you
should
take
the
figures
that
can
be
gained
from
the
record
and
the
exhibits
at
the
very
back
of
the
appendix
show
how
many
people
were
actually
counted
there
by
the
city's
enumerator.
they
had
a
man
go
out
mr.
smith,
who
was
a
witness
at
the
trial.
go
out
and
count
houses
and
count
people,
and
based
on
that,
you
can
figure
out
exactly
how
many
people
were
there.
district
court
made
it
quite
clear
it
was
talking
about
how
many
people
had
been
brought
in
at
the
time
of
annexation,
not
how
many
people
would
be
affected
at
the
time
of
the
election.
i
think
the
time
of
the
election
is
the
critical
part.
mr.
armand
derfner
you
would
have
a
net
of
approximately
250
or
more
extra
whites.
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
true,
but
it
is
not
thought
to
be
contrary
to
what
the
record
says.
mr.
armand
derfner
that
itself
might
not
have
made
a
difference,
would
not
have
made
a
difference
because
without
the
--
except
for
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
general
margin
in
the
general
election
was
some
800
votes
for
most
of
the
offices.
it
was
somewhat
less
than
that
in
the
primary
elections.
if
you
take
together
the
annexations
and
the
moving
of
the
polling
places
and
i
think
by
the
way
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
turn
out
in
ward
three,
you
will
see
that
it's
significantly
below
than
the
turn
out
in
the
other
wards,
ward
four
is
also
below.
if
you
take
the
moving
of
the
polling
place
plus
the
annexations,
i
think
you
will
find
that
there
is
enough
of
a
probability
that
a
change
would
have
taken
place,
so
that
this
court
should
--
so
that
a
new
election
would
be
fair,
would
be
equitable,
because
we're
not
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
a
change
in
the
results
was
a
(inaudible)
talking
about
and
remember
that
in
some
cases
as
in
bell
against
southwell,
you
do
not
need
any
effect
on
the
results.
we
are
talking
though
about
a
situation
in
which
the
results
could
well
have
been
changed.
mr.
armand
derfner
frankly,
your
honor,
if
--
when
i
had
been
here
in
allen
and
when
mr.
mcilwaine
had
been
here
in
allen,
if
we
had
thought
that's
--
that
the
court
meant
that
to
apply
beyond
the
allen
case,
we
would
not
have
brought
anymore
section
5
cases,
and
there
wouldn't
be
anymore
section
5.
this
is
just
not
worth
anything
if
it
doesn't
mean
a
new
election.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
with
the
short
life
for
the
act,
it
certainly
won't,
it
won't
mean
enough
to
make
a
difference.
at
the
time
we
brought
this
cases,
the
act
was
due
to
expire
in
a
year.
now
it's
been
extended
for
five
more.
there'd
be
one
more
municipal
election
under
these
terms.
frankly,
a
totally
perspective
ruling
just
doesn't
have
the
value
that
congress
meant
it
to
have.
mr.
armand
derfner
if
he
had
consented,
when?
mr.
armand
derfner
you
mean
before
the
election.
mr.
armand
derfner
certainly,
it
would
have.
well,
i
take
it
back,
it
would
have
been
valid
under
section
5.
we
still
would
attack
it
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armand
derfner
under
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
just
state
a
brief,
like
we
stated
in
response
to
questions
posed
in
slightly
different
force
by
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
harlan.
basically
the
question
was
how
can
you
expect
or
how
were
the
apportionment
fair
under
reynolds
against
sims
or
how
were
the
ward
elections
and
mr.
marshall's
question
was
relating
to
the
expansion
of
boundaries.
i
think
basically
what
section
5
had
said
is
that
--
is
that
the
certainty
that
these
are
valid
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
that
these
have
been
passed
in
good
faith
is
so
important
that
section
5
must
be
enforced
that
way.
but
these
are
not
questions
to
be
considered,
nor
even
that
we
have
to
make
any
proof
on
in
the
record
below
and
that
as
to
the
apportionment,
a
slight
dislocation
in
the
question
of
proper
apportionment
of
one
election
is
not
of
such
consequence,
will
not
dislocate
the
law
as
much
as
allowing
a
change
to
pass
without
proper
clearance
under
section
5,
which
if
it
happened,
would
create
every
incentive
for
every
jurisdiction,
never
to
submit
another
change
under
section
5.
