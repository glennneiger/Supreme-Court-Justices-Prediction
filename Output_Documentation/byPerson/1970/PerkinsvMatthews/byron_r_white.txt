justice
byron

white
would
the
election
and
it
maybe
that
the
section
5
as
you
say
covers
this
case
and
maybe
not,
but
even
if
it
does,
would
it
--
would
the
outcome
of
the
election
have
been
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
just
from
the
--
i
am
just
talking
about
the
annexation
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
early
1996
and
net
gain
in
1996?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
challenge
the
figures
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
we
supposed
to
accept,
your
figures
or
theirs?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
all
of
the
whites
who
lived
in
the
annexed
area,
registered
to
vote
and
all
the
blacks
registered?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
thought
to
be
contrary
to
what
the
district
court
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
have
made
a
difference
in
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
these
–
you
say
250,
without
these
250
white
votes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
in
allen,
in
allen
--
i
thought
the
court
may
clear
that
even
though
there
might
be
a
violation
of
section
5,
perhaps,
you
don't
always
order
an
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
mean
anything
prospectively.
justice
byron
r.

you
mean,
it
doesn't

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
94
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
that
possibly
have
made
any
difference
in
the
elections
by
itself?
