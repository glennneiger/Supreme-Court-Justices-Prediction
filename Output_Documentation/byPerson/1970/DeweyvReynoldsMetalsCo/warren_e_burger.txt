mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

suppose
an
employer
in
a
particular
--
in
a
small
enterprise
has
all
of
his
employees
who
share
this
belief.
what
does
he
do
about
that
and
no
one
will
work
on
sunday?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well,
there
are
many
enterprises
of
course
which
--
in
which
the
employer
has
no
choice
about
a
public
utility,
electric
power
company,
and
telephone
company.
let’s
assume
that
its
situation
in
which
the
employer
has
no
choice,
he
has
a
franchise
which
requires
him
to
give
24-hour
service,
seven
days
a
week
at
all
times.
and
then
alter
a
little
bit,
suppose
he
has
10
employees
and
five
of
them
assert
this
privilege
as
it
was
suggested
i
think
in
one
of
the
briefs
and
all
the
burden
of
sunday
work
falls
on
the
other
five
who
are
not
so
observant
of
the
sundays.
chief

mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief

warren
e.

well,
does
anyone
challenge
that
issue
here?
do
we
need
to
argue
that
this
man
is
sincere?
chief

e.

no,
i
don’t
read
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
griggs
case,
wasn’t
that
impact
discussion,
is
judging
it
by
its
impact
or
effect
tied
in
with
a
situation
in
which
there
had
been
a
long
history
of
discriminatory
employment
practice
--
chief

warren
e.

--
is
not
so?
chief

but
do
you
claim
any
long
history
of
discriminatory
practices
against
religious
beliefs
in
this
case?
chief

thank
you
mr.

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.

do
you
suggest
that
it
is
undesirable
to
have
rights
under
the
act
disposed
of
by
private
arbitration,
that
is
by
contractual
arbitration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
that
exclude
private
arbitration?
chief
justice
warren
e.

does
any
statute
ever
exclude
arbitration
unless
it
does
so
by
the
most
explicit
terms?
has
it
ever
been
so
held?
chief

setting
aside
for
a
moment,
even
though
not
setting
aside
is
unimportant
the
intervention
of
the

here
or
in
such
cases.
is
it
not
true
that
the
courts
generally
for
a
long
time
including
this
court
in
opinions
have
indicated
a
broad
approval
of
disposition
of
conflicts
by
arbitration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
didn’t
the
griggs
opinion
link
those
two
items
rather
intimately
together?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
a
different
question,
is
it
not,
from
conditioning
this
what
might
be
called
an
impact
test
or
impact
inquiry
to
the
existence
of
prior
discrimination
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
if
someone
suggested
that
your
argument
for
this
act
and
the
agency’s
construction
tends
to
create
a
governmental
preference
in
favor
of
religious
people
which
it
does
not
give
to
the
nonreligious
people,
would
you
say
that
reason
an
improper
inference?
chief

warren
e.

mr.

chief

e.

where
does
that
appear
in
the

could
you
tell
me?
chief
justice
warren
e.

don’t
interrupt
your
argument
now,
but
give
me
the
legislative
reference
sometime
after
your
argument.
chief

you
said
he
worked
overtime?
chief

is
it
overtime

chief

e.

that
would
not
be
remarkable
for
someone
to
change
his
views
on
a
religious
issue,
would
it?
chief

warren
e.

if
the

hypothetically
to
provide
for
final
binding
and
unreviewable
arbitration
of
all

claimed

would
that
be
the

your

opposition
with
the
question
something
like
that
said
the
union
cannot
bargain
away
the
employees’
rights
under
the
civil

what
would
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief

warren
e.

i
have
another
hypothetical
on
you
that
may
or
may
not
be
helpful
to
us.
suppose,
i
don’t
know
whether
you
have
a
union
shop
contract
here,
compulsory
union
membership
but
assume
--
chief
justice
warren

--
that’s
the
kind
you
had
and
suppose
mr.
dewey
had
a
tenet
of
this
religion
that
prohibits
him
from
joining
any
organization
against
his
will,
then
you
would
have
a
collision
between
the
compulsory

membership
claims
and
the
civil

act,
i
take
it?
chief

i'm
