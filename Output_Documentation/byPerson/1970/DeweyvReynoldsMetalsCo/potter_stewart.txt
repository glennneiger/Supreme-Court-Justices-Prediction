i
thought
your
point
mr.
wallace
was
that
this
arbitration
did
not
and
did
not
purport
to
settle
any
of
these
rights
under
the
act,
but
only
to
settle
this
right,
the
rights
on
the
parties
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
that
issue
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
earlier
this
term,
we
had
a
case
involving
a
very
ancient
statute,
18th
century
or
very
early
19th
century
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
affecting
seamen
and
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
which
that
seaman’s
union
and
his
employer
were
a
party.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wallace
didn’t
the
petitioner
also
seek
redress
under
the
state
statute,
the
michigan
civil
rights
law?
justice
potter
stewart
to
his
rights
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
necessary
condition
precedent
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
those
were
all
constitutional
cases,
first
amendment
cases.
this
is
not
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
question
is,
what
does
this
statute
mean
and
if
does
mean
that
congress
was,
by
statute
giving
employees
as
against
their
employer,
all
the
rights
that
all
of
us
have
against
government
under
the
first
amendment
then
what
you
say
is
obviously
correct,
but
that’s
the
issue
in
the
case,
isn’t
it?
that’s
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
issue
is,
what
does
this
statute
mean
as
related
to
these
facts?
