mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
an
action
for
money
damages
and
reinstatement
of
position
brought
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
respondent
reynolds
metals
company
discharged
petitioner
dewey
because
he
violated
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
by
his
union
and
his
employer
reynolds
metals
company.
the
violation
consisted
of
his
refusing
to
work
on
three
overtime
sunday
assignments
when
assigned
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
his
refusing
each
of
the
sundays
in
question
to
arrange
for
a
replacement.
this
was
an
ultimate
procedure
which
had
been
extensively
used
by
all
employees
including
petitioner
dewey.
if
you’ll
bear
with
me
and
we
feel
strongly
about
this,
there
are
six
separate
grounds
which
establish
in
this
matter
that
the
respondent
did
not
violate
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
outline
them
and
then
go
to
them.
one,
in
this
case,
the
discharge
did
not
violate
the
civil
rights
act
in
anyway.
two,
the
act
itself,
the
civil
rights
act
itself
contains
a
number
of
exemptions,
exceptions
and
limitations.
reynolds
falls
within
the
particular
exception.
three,
the
government
through
the
eeoc
has
stated
that
the
prohibition
against
discrimination
for
religious
reasons
includes
an
obligation
to
accommodate
religious
group
also.
respondent
argues
there
is
no
legal
basis
under
this
act
for
an
accommodation
and
the
enforcement
of
accommodation
by
the
eeoc
may
well
be
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
four,
even
if
accommodation
required
as
a
part
of
prohibition
against
discrimination
the
eeoc
has
issued
guidelines
which
in
two
instances
in
1966
read
up
by
the
conduct
the
reynolds
metals
company
and
in
a
third
part
of
the
1966
guideline,
we
accommodated
in
the
words
of
that
act.
five,
because
of
the
wording
of
the
act
itself
which
call
in
the
remedial
section
thereof
requiring
intentional
violation
which
mr.
wallace
just
referred
to,
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
right
under
the
law
to
reinstatement
of
back
pay.
and
finally
under
the
election
of
remedies
theory,
the
case
shouldn’t
even
be
here
as
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
indicated,
but
i
would
say
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
ruling
on
this
case
went
to
the
merits
first
and
then
to
the
procedure
and
so
it's
well
done
in
our
estimation
at
this
point
that
the
whole
matter
can
be
clarified
because
the
individual
involved,
the
petitioner
does
not
suffer
on
the
procedural
basis,
you
have
before
you
both
the
merits
and
the
procedure.
i’d
like
to
go
to
the
first
of
our
basis.
we
don’t
think
under
any
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act,
whether
you
go
discrimination
by
intent
or
discrimination
by
effect
that
there’s
any
violation.
the
objective
of
the
act
as
was
said
in
the
griggs
case
is
to
achieve
equal
employment
opportunity.
this
objective
is
to
be
achieved
through
prohibiting
selected
forms
employment
discrimination
involving
religion,
race,
color,
etcetera.
what
is
discrimination?
it
isn’t
defined
in
the
law.
the
classical
definition
has
to
do
and
it’s
that
of
making
a
distinction
or
making
a
difference
in
treatment
between
one
employer
and
another,
based
on
religion
in
this
particular
act.
the
more
important
question,
i
suppose,
is
what
kind
of
discrimination
is
prohibited.
what
are
we
talking
about?
are
we’re
talking
about
discrimination
by
intent?
are
we’re
talking
about
discrimination
by
effect?
i
would
summit
to
you
that
if
you
look
at
the
legislation
and
i
know
you
gentlemen
are
much
more
familiar
with
it
than
i,
but
nevertheless
i
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
act
itself,
for
instance,
703
(h)
in
this
particular
act.
it
says,
“an
employer
may
have
different
--
may
apply
different
terms
and
conditions
to
an
employee,”
and
then
the
magic
language,
“if
it
is
provided.”
if
it’s
based
on
a
bona
fide
seniority
system.“
provided
there
is
no
intention
to
discriminate.
go
to
706
(g);
the
remedial
relief
under
this
act
as
envisaged
by
congress
was
to
be
applied
reinstatement
and
back
pay
and
injunctive
action
if
the
employer
has
intentionally
engaged
in
unlawful
employment.
both
sections
seem
directed
at
discrimination
by
intent.
let
me
quote
to
you,
if
you
will,
and
it
is
very
hard
in
the
legislative
debates
because
of
the
way
that
the
act
was
passed
and
the
format
that
it
went
through
the
senate
and
the
house,
but
at
the
time
that
it
was
passed
then
senator
humphrey
had
this
to
say,
and
he
was
talking
about
section
706
(g)
and
he
said
in
part,
“706
(g)
is
amended
to
require
a
showing
of
intentional
violation
of
the
title
in
order
to
obtain
relief.”
this
is
a
clarifying
change.
since
the
title
bars
only
discrimination
because
of
race,
color,
religions,
sex
and
national
origin,
it
would
seem
already
to
require
intent
and
thus
the
proposed
change
does
not
involve
any
substantive
change
in
the
title.
the
express
requirement
of
intent
is
designed
to
make
it
wholly
clear
that
inadvertent
or
accidental
discriminations
will
not
violate
the
title
or
result
an
entry
of
court
orders.
it
means
simply
that
the
respondent
must
have
intended
--
must
have
intended
to
discriminate.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
would
probably
--
i’m
unable
to
say
that
it
is
in
the
brief,
or
the
appendix.
it
is
in
a
michigan
law
review
article
that
is
yet
unpublished.
senator
humphrey,
let
me
correct
myself
maybe
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
the
legislative
reference
would
be
110
congressional
record
12723
and
going
on
to
the
next
page,
12724,
1964.
a
further
support
for
this
definition
of
intent
is
found
in
the
views
expressed
by
senators
joseph
clark
and
clifford
case,
the
floor
managers
over
civil
rights
act.
in
their
interpretation
--
in
their
interpretive
memorandum
concerning
title
vii,
they
noted
inter
alia,
“it
has
been
suggested
that
the
concept
of
discrimination
is
vague.
in
fact,
it
is
clear
and
simple
and
has
no
hidden
meanings.
to
discriminate
is
to
make
a
distinction,
to
make
a
difference
in
treatment
or
favor
and
those
distinctions
are
differences
in
treatment
or
favor
which
are
prohibited
by
704,”
which
was
later
changed
to
703
when
the
act
to
came
out,
“are
those
which
are
based
on
any
five
of
the
forbidden
criteria:
race,
color,
religion,
sex
and
national
origin.
any
other
criterion
or
qualification
for
employment
is
not
affected
by
this
title.”
the
reference
is
110
congressional
records
7230.
i
submit
that
with
this
background,
i
would
like
to
take
you
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
case.
prior
to
1960,
this
plant
located
on
the
outskirts
of
grand
rapids,
michigan
was
found
it
impossible
not
difficult
as
the
district
judge
said,
but
as
the
stipulation
says
found
it
impossible
to
work
in
overtime
situations.
this
was
because
of
the
fact
that
overtime
under
the
uaw
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
based
on
a
voluntary
overtime
proposition
as
far
as
employees
were
concerned
and
the
plant
found
it
or
the
management
found
it
impossible
to
operate
on
overtime
situations.
the
company
negotiated
with
the
uaw
in
1960
as
the
bargaining
agent
and
achieved
the
compulsory
work
clause
which
provides
for
the
allocation
of
overtime
work
equally
among
the
classification
on
a
voluntary
basis.
and
let
me
explain
to
you
briefly
how
that’s
done.
in
that
situation,
when
there
is
an
overtime
situation,
according
to
union
contract,
you
equalize,
you
go
to
the
classification
and
you
at
first,
where
there
is
an
attempt
to
equalize
the
overtime
opportunities,
go
to
the
low
man
in
the
classification,
low
man
on
overtime
as
far
as
overtime
is
concerned,
his
past
experience.
he
is
given
first
opportunity
and
then
the
next
man
and
the
next
man
based
on
his
--
whether
where
they
are
on
the
overtime
regardless
of
seniority
for
the
moment.
if
enough
people
volunteer
then
there
is
no
reason
to
go
any
further.
if
you
don’t
have
enough
people
then
you
go
to
the
low
man
in
the
classification
by
seniority
and
you
compulse
until
you
get
enough
people
to
work
the
overtime.
this
compulsory
overtime
was
necessary
in
this
plant
to
enable
the
company
to
work
in
overtime
situations
when
business
demanded.
this
is
in
the
sense,
a
job
shop.
they
do
not
produce
for
storage.
they
produce
on
the
basis
of
orders
and
as
the
orders
to
accommodate
your
customers
to
compete
with
alcoa
and
kaiser.
this
is
the
necessity
that
arises
at
the
time.
this
was
the
business
necessity
to
enable
this
plan
to
work
on
six
and
seven
days
and
also
to
work
in
a
normal
overtime
situation.
beyond
that,
the
substitute
program
was
instituted
in
1965.
by
the
substitute
program
we
mean
that
if
an
individual
wanted
a
day
off
for
whatever
reason,
be
it
religion
or
otherwise,
he
could
have
a
day
off,
but
under
the
compulsory
overtime,
the
responsibility
was
his
to
seek
out
a
substitute.
this
system
of
accommodation
was
inaugurated
in
1965,
long
before
the
eeoc
suggested
accommodation
by
guidelines.
in
1964,
1965
and
1966,
there
was
an
increase
in
production
to
the
point
where
in
1966,
the
company
worked
substantial
overtime
on
24
out
of
37
sundays.
how
did
we
apply
this
compulsory
work
clause
in
the
substitute
system
in
the
contract?
the
company,
as
the
arbitration
indicates
and
as
all
courts
agree
to
this
point,
the
company
disciplined
all
who
refused
to
work
whether
it
was
because
of
sunday,
because
of
a
problem
on
sunday
or
because
of
any
other
day.
there
were
11
disciplinary
penalty
cases
involving
religion
prior
to
mr.
dewey’s
discharge.
there
were
a
host
of
other
disciplinary
actions
for
reasons
--
any
reason
on
any
day
on
overtime.
what
happened
to
mr.
dewey?
he
worked
overtime
prior
to
1961,
but
in
1960,
we
established,
as
i've
indicated,
a
compulsory
work
clause.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
he
work
over
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
he
worked
overtime
on
sunday
prior
to
1960.
that
will
found
in
the
appendix
at
77a.
in
other
words,
this
was
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
for
that
is,
as
you
will
see
is
that
his
present
or
his
--
and
i
don’t
want
to
say
present,
but
his
religious
preference
did
not
become
apparent
until
1961,
so
he
had
no
scruple
prior
to
1961.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
don’t
think
so
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
it
would
not
be
remarkable.
the
question
beyond
that.
i
agree
it
would
not
be.
the
question
beyond
that
is
how
much
protection
should
be
given
under
the
interpretation
of
the
act
and
i
agree
that
there's
no
reason
that
we
would
say
that
one
could
not
be
converted
to
whatever
faith
one
wanted
regardless
of
the
time
in
life.
in
1965,
i
believe,
in
october
--
on
november
of
1965,
mr.
dewey
refused
to
work
on
a
work
assignment
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
at
the
point,
he
was
warned,
at
that
point
he
was
not
disciplined.
in
1966,
as
the
record
indicates,
at
42a,
stipulation
15,
mr.
dewey
in
1966
used
the
substitute
system
on
five
occasions
and
then
finally
in
mid-1966,
august
28
to
be
specific,
mr.
dewey
refused
to
work.
he
refused
to
get
the
substitute.
on
september
4,
the
same
practice,
on
september
11,
the
same
practice.
for
each
of
these
situations,
on
the
first
occasion,
mr.
dewey
was
disciplined.
on
the
second,
he
was
discipline
again
in
the
form
of
a
three-day
layoff
and
on
the
third
occasion
he
was
discharged
for
refusal
to
work
or
to
get
a
substitute.
in
conclusion
on
that
point,
the
labor
agreement
and
the
replacement
system
was
nondiscriminatory
and
was
applied
uniformly
to
all
employees
via
the
seniority
system
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
dewey
was
never
assigned
nor
denied
overtime
because
of
religion.
reynolds
did
not
discriminate
against
dewey,
rather
it
afforded
him
and
everybody
else
equal
employment
opportunity.
the
sixth
circuit
says
very
definitely
and
says
it
as
well
as
i
can
say
it
that
the
collective
bargaining
--
there
was
nothing
discriminatory
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
nor
in
its
application.
it
was
a
fair
and
equitable
method
of
distributing
a
heavy
workload
among
all
the
employees
without
discrimination
against
any.
griggs
doesn’t
require
on
our
opinion
the
application
of
a
different
rule.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
rule
as
far
as
we
can
see
is
that
we
are
looking
at
discrimination
by
intention
and
griggs
doesn’t
require
in
our
opinion
the
application
of
the
different
rule.
the
court
said
in
griggs
with
all
do
deference
to
the
court,
our
understanding
of
it
that
practices
neutral
on
their
face,
neutral
in
intent,
uniformly
applied
cannot
be
maintained
if
they
operate
to
freeze
the
status
quo
of
prior
discriminatory
employment
practices.
in
this
situation
before
this
court,
there
are
no
prior
discriminatory
practices.
it
was
a
regular
policy
neutral
on
its
face,
nondiscriminatory
in
intent
and
even-handed
an
application.
that
can't
be
anything
more
fair
than
the
policy
that
was
used
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
mr.
dewey
has
been
with
the
company
since
approximately
1951.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
20
years
--
let
me
say
20
years
to
1971
until
the
time
of
the
discharge
in
1966,
he
had
been
there
15
sir.
he
acquired
his
religious
preference,
his
religious
scruple
in
1961.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
reformed
--
the
religious
scruple
was
that
it
was
against
the
tenets
of
his
religion
as
he
envisaged
his
religion
to
work
on
sunday.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
an
interesting
point,
that
aspect
of
this
tenet
did
not
develop
until
1965.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
present
tenet
is
that
he
can't
work
in
19
--
he
can’t
work
as
a
tenet
of
his
religion
and
secondly
he
can't
ask
someone
else
to.
now,
i
don’t
want
to
go
in
to
the
thing
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
religion
nor
do
i
really
want
to
engage
the
court
in
what
is
the
definition
of
religion.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
with
mr.
dewey?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
during
the
time
he
worked
we
had
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
how
many
days
we
have
a
dispute
over.
we
have
a
dispute
within
on
one
particular
sunday
in
1965,
on
three
particular
days
in
1966.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
your
question
--
your
question
suggests
why
would
not
the
company
get
the
substitute.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
alright.
alright,
i
will
answer
you
specifically.
the
discharge
was
in
our
opinion
mandatory
as
far
as
the
company
is
concerned
in
the
uniform
administration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
that
day,
this
contract
has
both
a
contractual,
it
has
a
--
it
has
the
contract
itself.
there
are
also
in
the
record
shop
rules
and
the
shop
rules
call
for
certain
penalties
under
certain
circumstances
with
the
ability
of
the
company
to
be
more
lenient
if
they
choose.
in
an
answer,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
to
your
question
if
we
back
off
this
situation,
we
have
to
back
off
every
religious
situation
and
we
know
not
where
we
go
as
far
as
how
deep
that
exception
is
if
we
release
as
to
dewey
or
accept
as
to
dewey.
our
fear
is
that
we
lose
our
--
we
lose
our
rule,
our
compulsory
work
rule
and
under
those
circumstances,
our
last
days
are
worse
than
our
first
in
the
sense
that
we’re
back
to
a
pre-1960
situation
where
we
will
not
be
able
to
work
overtime
when
the
company
has
a
business
necessity.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
or
saturday.
in
other
words,
this
rule
of
compulsory
overtime
applies
to
all
overtime
situations
and
if
we
accept
as
to
one
individual
whether
it'd
be
sunday,
whether
it'd
be
saturday,
whether
it'd
would
be
any
given
day,
a
normal
day,
then
we
are
of
opinion
that
we
can't
apply
it
uniformly.
we
will
have
great
resistance.
in
other
words,
the
essence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
my
experience
is
uniformity
of
application.
treat
me
just
the
same
way
you
treat
everybody
else
and
if
you
make
exemptions
for
me,
mr.
justice
black,
you
must
make
exceptions
for
everybody
else
under
the
labor
agreement
or
else
you
have
disparate
treatment
under
the
labor
agreement.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
mr.
dewey
was
put
back
to
work
in
the
plant
by
way
of
injunction,
by
virtue
of
the
injunction
of
the
district
judge
from
the
western
district
of
michigan.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
no
sir
because
we’re
under
injunction.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
we
would
--
if
he
stays
there,
we’re
under
injunction
at
the
present
time,
if
he
stays
there
he
will
be
obliged
to
take
his
term
overtime
just
as
every
single
person
in
the
plant
when
that
occasion
demands.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
no
sir
we’re
under
injunction
not
to
apply
overtime
to
him.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
because
we
--
yes
sir,
in
answer
to
your
specific
question.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
injunction
sir?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
contract
was
--
the
contract
--
the
essence
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
is
to
treat
everybody
the
same
and
to
avoid
disparate
treatment
that’s
the
essence
of
it.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
under
the
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
my
answer
is
that
under
our
opinion,
the
matter
was
settled
when
it
went
to
the
--
when
it
went
to
arbitration
and
in
that
situation,
the
arbitrator
held
for
the
company
as
against
mr.
dewey
and
that
was
a
final
resolution
in
the
ordinary
contract
situation,
that
would
be
final.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
that’s
final
except
that
--
except
that
under
the
way
that
the
civil
rights
act
is
applied
for
the
moment,
an
employee
has
two
bites
of
the
apple
and
this
is
the
election
of
remedies
problem.
it
reminds
me
into
a
certain
extent
of
two
small
boys,
we
say
let's
go
two
out
of
three
and
we’ll
flip
and
when
the
loser
flips,
loser
says,
let's
go
three
out
of
five.
in
this
situation,
it’s
heads,
the
employee
wins,
tails
let's
flip
again
because
if
he
loses
on
arbitration
then
he
goes
the
civil
rights
route.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
i’d
like
to
say,
mr.
justice
black
that
i
don’t
think
the
contract
needs
changing
because
i
don’t
think
the
law
says
that
we
have
to
do
it.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
have
to
say
to
you
at
that
point
we
would
have
to
attempt
to
negotiate
with
the
union
to
make
certain
exceptions
to
that
policy
and
at
that
point,
i
don’t
know
what
the
consequences
of
the
resolution
of
the
problem
would
be.
in
other
words,
can
you
accept,
can
you
get
the
union
to
accept
for
a
part
of
its
people
accept
overtime
requirements
on
certain
days
for
part
of
its
people.
i
guess
the
easy
answer
to
that
is
everybody
will
turn
religious
and
then
the
exception
will
swallow
up
the
rule.
but
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
you
can't
bargain
away
a
right,
but
let
me
say
that
in
this
case,
and
we
are
going
to
the
election
of
rights
theory,
the
right
--
the
right
in
the
contract
and
the
right
under
civil
rights,
now
the
right
in
the
agreements
was
discrimination
against
the
individual.
the
right
in
title
vii
that’s
alleged
is
discrimination
against
the
individual.
the
remedy
is
reinstatement
back
pay
under
arbitration.
the
remedy
under
title
vii
is
restatement
of
back
pay
and
my
answer
is
that
i
think
in
this
situation
that
the
rights
are
the
same
and
there
are
two
four
of
it
are
available,
but
you
can't
go
both
ways.
and
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
you
could
make
clause
of
that
sort
possibly,
but
i
suppose
it
might
not
be
applicable
in
every
case.
i'm
not
positive
in
this
particular
case.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rights
and
remedies
are
the
same.
the
hutchings
case
says
that
there
are
two
causes
of
action
here
and
you
can
see
that
and
look
at
the
distinction
between
the
rights
and
remedies.
hutchings
and
bowe
both
say
that
analysis
doesn’t
bear
the
amount
in
this
case
and
there’s
one
cause
of
action
or
one
claim
in
this
case,
one
common
claim
and
really
we
don’t
quarrel
with
whichever
way
you
go,
whether
you
go
the
arbitration
route
or
whether
you
the
civil
rights
litigation
route,
but
go
on
--
and
go
both
at
the
same
time
if
you
wish
but
when
you
get
a
judgment
at
one,
it
should
be
foreclosed.
and
in
that
regard,
in
that
regard
if
this
court
should
go
the
concurrent
remedy
route,
an
interesting
thing
will
come
to
pass,
i
believe,
in
this
that
the
vitality
of
arbitration
is
its
finality.
in
this
particular
situation,
if
you
go,
if
you
espouse
a
concurrent
route,
every
employee
will
write
his
grievance
in
the
language
of
the
contract,
in
a
discipline
case.
i
was
disciplined.
i
didn’t
get
a
promotion,
i
didn’t
get
my
vacation
on
time,
you
discipline
me
or
you
took
me
out
of
line
to
seniority
and
it
will
add
one
of
the
word
in
every
grievance
and
that
word
will
either
be
age
and
we
all
have
it
one
way
or
another.
it
will
be
sex,
we
all
have
it
one
way
or
another,
religion,
generally
we
have
it.
color,
we
have
it
one
way
or
other.
and
so
in
that
case
each
individual
add
one
word
and
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
too
cleverly
done,
then
the
matter
will
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
if
the
employee
wins,
that’s
the
end
of
the
case.
if
the
employee
loses,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
that
point,
he
said
that
was
too
bad
that
was
a
bad
ride,
now,
i
will
go
on
to
my
second
of
my
two
rides
to
the
litigation
route
by
statute
under
title
vii.
and
i
say
to
you
that
as
far
as
you
union
contracts
are
concerned
that
i
can
foresee
very
quickly
that
that
vitality
of
that
arbitration
as
a
final
and
binding
rule
is
gone
and
the
government
says
in
its
brief
at
a
certain
juncture,
“now
look,
what
we
really
mean
in
this
case
is
you
as
an
employer
get
a
quid
pro
quo
for
arbitration
is
a
no
straight
clause.
i
grant
you
that
but
there
is
also
a
significant
thing
that
when
you
get
arbitration
as
a
final
step,
it
won’t
be
final
anymore
because
these
things
are
the
basic
essences
of
life
when
you
take
those
things
that
are
on
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
arbitration
in
its
own
--
in
the
collective
bargaining
context
is
as
far
i'm
concerned,
i
agree
with
everything
this
court
and
prior
courts
has
said,
it's
an
excellent
way
to
keep
the
safety
valve
on
the
cap
and
it’s
the
one
way
that
companies
can
live
with
unions
and
unions
with
companies
and
they
can
resolve
their
difficulties
and
that
if
the
arbitrators
in
america
today
take
a
collection
of
these
cases
that
are
never
getting
to
the
court.
what
happens
is
when
you
get
a
title
vii
that
pops
up
and
i'm
not
disparaging
title
vii
but
there
isn’t
any
treatment,
congressionally
speaking,
as
to
how
this
thing
will
be
treated.
and
as
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
this
is
a
matter
for
judicial
discretion
as
to
how
we’re
going
to
handle
the
interrelationship
of
title
vii
and
arbitration.
i
think
arbitration
does
a
splendid
job
in
the
american
industrial
complex
today.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
oh
no
sir,
i
have
to
say
i've
been
in
the
labor
practice
for
20
years
and
i’ll
take
my
lumps
both
ways.
i
think
it’s
a
safety
valve
of
no
small
impact.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
alright,
let
me
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
let
me
say
this;
that
the
hypothetical
that
you
impose
and
the
actual
case
before
you,
in
other
words,
the
union
shop
clause
is
negotiate
--
the
taft-hartley
or
the
labor
management
relations
act
says
that
that
union
shop
is
a
--
can
be
negotiated
and
it
is
negotiated
and
practically
in
every
uaw
contract
with
which
we’re
most
familiar
the
union
shop
is
in
being.
and
it
--
and
also,
in
the
case
before
you,
the
taft-hartley
also
says
that
overtime
--
negotiation
in
overtime
is
a
compulsory
matter
of
negotiation
between
the
parties
and
it
can
be
negotiated,
so
that
taft-hartley
approves
both
of
these
situations.
and
your
question
to
me
i
gather
is
that
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
these
situations
as
far
as
religion
i
have
to
say
at
this
juncture,
at
the
present
state
of
the
law,
that
i
would
say
that
as
long
as
the
application
is
made
to
--
as
long
as
the
law
is
in
its
present
state
and
you
apply
the
law
to
everybody
the
same
rule,
there
isn’t
any
discrimination.
the
question
i
think
that
you’re
getting
at
or
what
i
sense
and
in
this
sense
is
what
has
the
civil
rights
act
done
as
far
as
espousing
discrimination?
some
say
and
i
think
this
is
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
what
they
really
did,
what
congress
really
did
was
they
took
the
first
amendment
and
moved
it
into
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
i
say
and
that
would
be
that
you
can
freely
exercise
your
religion
and
employment.
i
submit
to
you
sir
that
the
language
--
if
the
congress
wanted
to
do
that,
they
could
very
well
have
done
it
but
they
didn’t
do
it.
so
the
question
is
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
does
not
involve
a
first
amendment
transplant.
i
think
what
it
does
do
is
equal
employment
opportunity
and
it
says,
“look,
will
you
please
treat
everybody
the
same
as
far
as
religion
is
concerned.
treat
them
the
same
as
far
as
sex
is
concerned.”
for
instance,
in
martin
marietta
that
was
before
you,
you
say
--
the
court
says
that
you
can't
treat
married
woman
differently
from
married
man,
this
is
equalization.
so,
that
under
those
circumstances
--
under
those
circumstances
as
far
as
your
question
is
concerned,
i
must
say
that
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
think
that
the
civil
rights
act
would
not
prohibit
--
would
not
strike
down
the
union
shop.
in
my
--
in
summary
on
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
the
objective
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
we
see
the
act
as
equal
employment
opportunity.
however,
the
act
prescribes
discriminatory
preference
for
any
group,
minority
or
majority,
words
from
griggs
v.
duke
power.
in
our
estimation,
dewey
is
requesting
preferential
treatment
not
accorded
to
other
employees.
he
has
no
such
right
under
the
first
amendment.
he
has
no
such
right
under
the
civil
rights
act.
in
michigan
civil
rights
act
and
this
was
raised
today,
the
michigan
civil
rights
commission,
a
constitutional
body
in
the
state
of
michigan
treated
this
case
as
far
back
as
1966
and
said
that
an
employer
has
the
right
to
establish
a
normal
work
weekend
foreseeable
overtime
in
its
labor
agreement
and
absent
an
intent
to
discriminate
there
was
no
right
of
accommodation
and
there
were
no
violation.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
same
result
should
be
pertain
here.
i’d
like
to
touch
on
one
other
aspect
as
far
as
congress
is
concerned.
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
in
this
act
and
no
one
with
the
exception
of
the
sixth
circuit
would
pay
much
attention
to
them.
the
exception
to
which
i
refer
and
is
one
that
i
start
out
with
and
i
think
it
exemplifies
again
what
congress
intended.
703
(a)
specifies
that
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
apply
different
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
provided
that
differences
are
not
resolved
with
an
intention
discriminate
because
of
race,
color,
religion.
the
questions
in
the
senate
debate
are
very
revealing
and
they
ask
at
the
time
and
they
said
at
the
time
that
the
intent
of
the
act
was
that
it
shouldn’t
conflict
with
the
rights
of
seniority
nor
with
collective
bargaining
contract
which
are
based
on
bona
fide
seniority.
and
in
the
senate,
the
question
was
asked,
“well,
what
if
a
negro
were
the
last
man
hired
in
your
plant
and
you
came
to
a
layoff
situation
and
the
seniority
provision
says,
the
junior
man
will
be
laid
off
first
as
historically
it
does,
that
maybe
a
classification
of
seniority,
it
maybe
plant
wide
seniority
and
what
if
it
says
the
junior
man
is
to
be
laid
off
and
this
negro
is
the
last
man
in?”
then
the
answer
in
the
debates,
there
would
be
no
discrimination
on
that
theory
that
the
low
man
on
the
totem
pole
or
the
junior
man
goes
first.
in
the
reynolds
overtime
situation,
the
application
is
based
on
a
seniority
clause
negotiated
years
ago
based
on
classification
of
seniority.
you
get
your
seniority
when
you
go
to
the
classification.
no
one
chooses,
picks
or
does
otherwise.
you
get
it
when
you
go
in.
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
bona
fides
of
that
classification
of
the
seniority.
so,
the
assignment
of
overtime
is
tied
to
a
neutral
policy,
so
that
thus
there
arises
differences
in
terms
of
employment.
i
work
on
sunday,
you
don’t.
you
work
on
sunday,
i
don’t.
this
is
allowed
under
the
act
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
the
congress
said
this
is
an
exemption.
i
want
to
touch
on
one
other
point
and
this
was
alluded
to
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
white
and
by
mr.
justice
stewart
at
one
point.
two
things,
the
prohibition
against
discrimination
according
to
the
eeoc
includes
an
obligation
to
accommodate.
the
civil
rights
act
is
expressed
in
term
of
prohibition
meaning
that
an
employer
should
not
differentiate
between
employees
on
the
basis
of
religion,
i'll
restrict
myself
to
religion.
the
concept
of
accommodation
has
no
basis
in
the
statute
and
in
effect
is
a
form
of
discrimination
itself.
accommodation
in
its
simplest
form
means,
to
adjust,
to
help,
to
do
a
favor
for.
the
civil
rights
act
permits
the
eeoc
to
interpret
the
law.
the
civil
rights
act
doesn’t
permit
the
eeoc
to
legislate.
the
sixth
circuit
on
page
32
or
our
brief
said
that
the
requirement
of
accommodation
is
not
consistent
with
the
act.
the
stemple
case
from
california
which
was
refused
certiorari
by
this
court,
although
on
a
constitutional
question
because
the
relationship
is
the
government
to
an
employee,
also
takes
the
position
that
accommodation
is
not
necessary
under
the
first
amendment.
the
houston
greyhound
case
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york
holds
that
as
to
accommodation
one
not
need
making
accommodation
to
particularization
which
could
assume
many
variations
in
appearance
and
in
time
schedules.
and
not
only
is
their
apparent,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
that
accommodation
constitutes
legislation
not
interpretation
here,
but
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
i
think
that
authorizing
of
accommodation
by
the
eeoc
or
compelling
employees
to
accommodate
raises
a
question
of
whether
you
are
not
into
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
in
shepp,
you
held
that
the
government
must
be
neutral
with
respect
to
religious
matters.
in
gillette
versus
the
united
states,
this
term,
you
said
that
as
a
general
rule
the
establishment
clause
prohibits
the
government
from
departing
secular
purposes
in
order
to
put
in
it
premature
on
one
religion
or
on
religion
as
such
or
to
favor
the
adherence
of
any
sect
or
religious
organization.
by
issuing
guidelines
the
eeoc,
by
issuing
guidelines
in
which
religious
beliefs
are
to
be
accommodated,
the
government
find
itself
putting
it
in
premature
on
religion
as
such
and
this
seems
to
us
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
if
the
government
has
a
general
rule
as
without
power
to
support
or
favor
any
religion,
it
is
submitted
that
the
effect
on
this
case
is
that
eeoc
is
in
fact
favoring
religion
through
its
guidelines
and
such
action
could
well
be
unconstitutional.
this
question
was
raised
in
the
sixth
circuit.
another
step
and
this
was
raised
also
by
you
gentlemen
especially
i
think
by
mr.
justice
white.
if
accommodation
is
required,
i
suggest
that
the
guidelines
exempt
reynolds.
section
713
(b)
provides
a
guideline
upon
which
one
is,
this
is
a
congressional
act
of
a
civil
rights
act,
if
you
are
on
conformity
with
the
guideline,
if
you
rely
on
the
guideline
it’s
a
bar
to
actions
or
proceedings
under
this
act,
the
first
guideline
and
the
guideline
that
should
be
applied
in
this
case
is
the
1966
guideline.
employee
dewey
was
disciplined
and
subsequently
discharged
in
august
and
september
of
1966.
the
1966
guideline
set
forth
for
the
first
time
the
principle
of
accommodation
as
being
included
within
the
ambit
of
discrimination.
but
look
what
that
guideline
said
at
1605.1
(a)
(3),
it
said,
“however,
the
commission
believes
that
an
employer
is
free
under
title
vii
to
establish
a
normal
work
week
generally
applicable
to
all
employees,
notwithstanding
that
such
schedule
may
operate
with
uniformity
in
its
effect
may
not
operate
with
uniformity
in
its
effect
upon
the
religious
observances
of
one’s
employees.”
this
is
the
1966
guideline.
reynolds
established
a
normal
work
week
generally
applicable
to
all
employees
long
prior
to
the
discharge
of
dewey,
long
prior
to
the
effect
of
date
the
civil
rights
act
and
long
prior
to
the
effect
of
date
of
the
guidelines.
when
the
guidelines
came
out
in
june
1966,
reynolds
looked
at
those
guidelines
knew
that
they
were,
if
you’ll
excuse
the
expression,
“on
the
money.”
they
were
squarely
in
agreement
with
those
guidelines
with
the
exception
that’s
written
into
the
1966
guideline.
that
guidelines
sets
forth
the
impact,
it
sets
forth
the
uniformity
of
application
theory
and
specifies
that
regardless
of
the
impact
if
you
have
a
uniform
application,
you
are
free,
you
have
a
bar
to
this
action
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
case
should
have
been
taken
care
of
by
the
eeoc
years
ago
under
it's
own
guideline.
i
recognize
that
the
guideline
was
changed
in
1967,
a
year
later,
but
the
law
as
written
by
congress,
if
anybody
is
interested
in
it
and
i
know
you
gentlemen
are,
but
the
question
that
the
law
is
written
it
says
this
guideline
or
any
guideline,
if
you
are
in
conformity
with
it,
if
you
rely
on
it
under
those
circumstances
it
will
be
a
bar
to
any
action
for
discrimination
even
if
the
guideline
is
subsequently
changed
by
judicial
fiat,
by
administrated
decree,
it
makes
no
difference.
again,
look
at
the
1966
guideline,
it
says,
here
are
some
illustrations,
what
do
you
mean
by
accommodation?
it
says
we
authorized
the
employer.
the
employer
should
be
authorized
to
prescribe
the
normal
work
week
and
foreseeable
overtime
requirements
and
absent
any
intent
to
discriminate.
an
employee
who
knows
or
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
requirements
of
his
employment
will
conflict
with
his
religious
beliefs
is
not
entitled
to
request
an
accommodation
of
his
religious
needs.
we
negotiated
our
compulsory
work
clause
in
1960.
mr.
dewey
attained
and
we
have
no
question
he
attained
his
religious
scruple
in
1961
for
the
first
time.
when
he
did,
he
had
knowledge
of
our
compulsory
work
clause
and
under
the
guideline,
he
knew
that
our
schedules
had
presented
him
with
the
problem
and
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
the
eeoc
at
that
time
said
that
as
far
as
they’re
concerned,
in
such
a
situation
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
request
an
accommodation.
and
then
you
go
another
step,
what’s
the
accommodation
in
the
guideline?
the
accommodation
in
the
guideline
is
time
off.
that’s
what
it
reads
and
i
submit
to
you
that’s
what
we
have
done
as
far
as
time
off
is
concerned.
we
have
reasonably
accommodated,
if
there’s
an
accommodation
obligation
and
the
further
question
that's
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
by
the
government
is,
“look,
when
you
get
down
to
basics,
why
don’t
you
take
the
step
and
get
the
substitute?”
our
answer
is
this.
“in
1960,
prior
to
’60,
we
couldn’t
work
overtime.”
we
negotiated
--
we
negotiated
the
compulsory
overtime
clause.
we
worked
hard
for
that
and
in
1965,
it
was
renegotiated.
it
has
subsequently
been
renegotiated
beyond
this
--
beyond
the
confines
of
this
record
in
the
seven-week
strike
and
suit,
partly
on
that
clause.
disregard
that
if
you
will,
but
it's
hard
one,
this
clause.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
you
get
the
substitute.
if
we
get
the
substitute,
three
things
happen.
we
fear,
one
and
we
went
in
to
this
a
little
bit,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
at
that
point,
one
if
we
get
dewey’s
substitute,
obviously,
we
have
to
get
all
religious
--
substitutes
for
all
religious
people
who
request.
now,
the
second
step
is
what
holds
you
to
that?
in
other
words,
if
you
accept
as
to
one
element
in
your
organization
there
are
no
and
hand
holds
or
bars
to
accepting
to
all.
the
government
says
at
a
particular
point
in
its
brief
as
does
petitioner,
that
in
that
situation,
what
you
should
do
is
you
should
accept
as
to
the
religious
people
and
impress
the
other
people,
make
the
nonreligious
people
work
because
the
civil
rights
act
takes
precedence
over
the
contract.
i
submit
to
you
that
what
we’re
doing,
what
they
are
suggesting
that
we
do
we
will
be
back
here.
god
willing,
in
approximately
two
or
three
years
under
a
situation
where
what
we
then
are
doing
is
making
people
work
who
have
no
religious
beliefs.
whatever
their
beliefs
are,
we
must
say
there
are
no
religious
beliefs
and
under
that
circumstance,
the
religious
people
are
free
and
those
without
religion
or
impressed
into
work.
i
think
that’s
a
discrimination
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
think
we’re
making
our
decision
basically
on
religion.
this
is
just
what
the
act
says.
i
think
this
is
intentional
discrimination.
i
also
think
it's
a
violation
of
title
vii
and
it
is
also
a
violation
of
our
labor
contract
because
you
--
such
a
situation
would
be
making
us
go
back
up
the
ladder
and
skip
those
seniority
people
who
had
a
religious
exception.
and
under
these
circumstances
we’ll
not
only
have
grievances,
we
will
have
arbitration,
if
we
accept
as
to
religion,
i
would
if
i
were
on
the
other
side.
if
i
were
an
employee
and
i
i’m
with
uaw,
i
would
probe
us
through
arbitration
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
waiver
of
the
exception
that
we’re
doing
and
we
submit
to
you
that
if
we
were
forced
to
get
the
substitute,
these
results
come
about,
we
will
be
back
as
the
biblical
expression
is,
“our
last
days
will
be
worse
than
our
first.”
in
other
words,
we
will
back
to
pre-1960.
we
will
not
be
able
to
work
overtime
to
meet
our
demands.
we
will
be
possibly
faced
with
the
title
vii
violation.
we
will
also
be
faced
with
the
violation
of
our
contract.
so,
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
if
you
want
to
talk
in
terms
the
1966
guideline,
that
certainly
is
a
serious
inconvenience.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
1967
guideline,
that’s
undue
hardship.
i
would
say
that
on
the
--
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
that
we
have
not
violated
the
contract
under
any
--
the
civil
rights
act
under
any
interpretation
of
the
law
and
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
the
election
of
remedies
briefly
and
in
that
area,
the
two
general
theories
that
have
evolved
are
the
theories
they
were
posed
to
you
today,
the
sixth
circuit
saying
that
claims
that
when
you
have
an
employee
obtains
an
adjudication
in
arbitration,
he
should
not
be
permitted
to
proceed
on
the
same
claim
because
you
impose
upon
an
employer
multiple
legal
actions
on
the
same
claim
and
you
can
lead
to
an
erosion
of
arbitration
as
a
final
remedy.
the
second
theory
is
phrased
in
terms
of
hutchings
and
bowe
in
terms
of
the
rights
and
remedies
under
arbitration
and
under
title
vii
are
separate
and
i
mentioned
this
briefly
but
i
wish
you’d
bear
with
me.
in
the
grievance
that
was
presented,
in
the
arbitration
or
a
grievance
part
of
the
contract,
it
was
said
that
it
was
a
clear
case
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
company
in
applying
its
policy
to
a
petitioner.
in
the
process
of
arbitration
in
which
petitioner
was
represented
by
the
international
rep
of
the
uaw,
and
i
might
add,
notwithstanding
gideon
and
its
ramifications,
i
think
that
in
arbitration
and
in
those
areas
that
the
international
reps
have
most
unions
are
as
skilled,
if
not
more
so,
than
many
lawyers
and
do
a
better
job
because
this
is
their
bread
and
butter
vis-à-vis
the
lawyer
who
doesn’t
specialize.
but
i
say
that
in
that
situation,
the
union
suggested
in
that
arbitration
that
the
effect
of
the
application
of
the
labor
agreement
resulted
in
discrimination
against
its
employees
who
seek
to
be
excused
from
assigned
work
for
reasons
of
religion.
now,
the
arbitrator
found
the
employee
could
not
refuse
to
work
on
sunday
because
of
the
wording
of
the
labor
contract
and
the
employer’s
consistent
administration
as
to
all
employees
of
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
agreement.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
argument,
that
the
rights
under
arbitration
are
different
from
the
rights
under
the
law
or
under
the
statute
doesn’t
stand
up.
they
are
the
same
in
this
case.
again,
the
distinguishing
factor
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
remedies
are
different
and
i
said
before
in
this
case
the
remedy,
what
is
the
remedy?
the
remedy
in
arbitration
is
reinstatement
of
back
pay.
what
is
the
remedy
under
the
statute?
it's
reinstatement
on
back
pay.
someone
would
add,
yes,
but
you
can
get
in
injunction
under
title
vii
in
the
statutory
process.
i
say
you
can
get
a
prior
decision
of
an
arbitrator
or
a
decision
of
an
arbitrator
which
acts
as
precedent,
so
that
i
submit
that
under
circumstances,
the
better
judicial
principle
would
be
that
enunciated
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
district
court
in
california
to
the
effect
that
you
may
pursue
both
remedies
as
long
as
you
will,
but
when
you
get
a
decision
in
one
then
the
issue
becomes
moot
in
the
other
forum.
it
would
appear
that
this
approach
to
the
question
would
also
be
sound
administratively.
speaking
in
that
concurrent
jurisdiction,
it
brings
waste,
confusion,
forum
shopping
and
what
appears
to
be
an
unnecessary
series
of
litigations.
and
i
have
given
away
part
of
my
argument
in
the
sense
that
i
think
that
as
far
as
arbitration
is
concerned
and
mr.
justice
black
discussed
the
finality
of
the
arbitration,
i
think
that
we
are
in
serious
difficulty
as
a
remedy.
and
i
recognize
lincoln
mills
and
boys
market
and
steelworkers
trilogy
and
everything
that
this
court
is
said
and
it
can
be
undone
if
you
allow
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
theory.
and
then,
i
write
into
my
arbitration,
i
write
into
my
grievance,
you
violated
my
seniority
provisions
because
you
didn’t
follow
the
wording
in
the
contract
and
also
i'm
49
because
of
age
and
you
say
this
is
ridiculous.
what
it's
got
to
do
with
age?
don’t
use
age,
use
religion,
use
color,
use
sex
and
i
say
under
those
circumstances,
this
is
what
is
coming
in
this
situation
that
you
then
have
two
bites
of
the
apple
in
every
situation
and
unlike
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
matrix
of
the
civil
rights
act
is
interwoven
into
the
labor
contract.
everything
you
do
in
the
labor
contract
takes
all
the
condition
that
you
cover
involved
in
the
working
conditions
cover
the
prescriptions
of
the
civil
rights
act,
so
that
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
election
of
remedies
theory
should
be
applied.
i
read
--
arguelles
is
very
interesting
and
the
problem
that
was
raised
there
and
i
think
this
problem
that
is
raised
here
is
much
more
significant
than
the
problem
with
all
due
respect
to
arguelles
because
of
the
impact
that
you’re
going
to
suffer,
that
we
are
going
to
suffer
are
arbitration
as
a
final
process.
so
under
these
circumstances,
i
would
conclude
by
saying
that
it
is
submitted
that
the
civil
rights
act
--
under
the
civil
rights
act
management
should
have
the
right
to
establish
working
schedules
including
overtime.
the
working
schedules
in
this
case
were
applied
on
a
uniform
and
nondiscriminatory
basis.
an
employee
has
the
duty
to
observe
these
work
schedules
that
are
so
established
and
for
the
religious
beliefs
of
an
employee
don’t
entitle
of
individual
to
special
or
peculiar
privileges
denied
to
others.
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
you
gentlemen
are
faced
and
the
enormous
problems
don’t
balk
you,
they
don’t
bother
you.
i'm
a
lawyer
from
a
midwestern
state
and
i
am
overwhelmed
at
some
of
these
problems,
but
i
won’t
oppose
the
problem
that
faces
you
eventually.
according
to
the
1962
yearbook
of
american
churches
which
is
the
nearest
year
that
i
can
take
to
the
dewey
discharge
in
1965,
there
were
259
religious
bodies
reporting
membership
in
the
united
states.
they
had
a
membership
at
that
point
of
114
million
people.
the
work
force
of
the
united
states
today
amounts
to
70
million
employees.
as
to
religious
observances
of
various
days
i
selected
four
categories.
i
chose
catholic
because
i
am
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
they
did.
there
are
52
sundays
and
13
holidays,
holy
days
or
total
of
65
particular
days
where
we
could
wear
this
accommodation
may
work
in.
the
jewish
religion
has
52
saturdays
and
30
other
holy
days
for
a
total
of
82
days.
the
greek
orthodox
has
52
sundays
and
10
other
holy
days
for
a
total
of
62
days.
the
seventh
day
adventist
as
best
that
i
can
see
have
52
saturdays.
the
total
of
these
four
religions
alone
amounts
to
approximately
261
days
upon
which
the
employees
under
the
eeoc
accommodation
theory
might
ask
for
accommodation
in
terms
of
time
off.
the
problem
of
scheduling,
the
problem
of
extra
manpower,
the
problems
of
administration
which
are
difficult
in
ordinary
situations
become
a
great
deal
more
complicated.
such
an
analysis
brings
in
to
perspective
the
statement
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
in
the
stemple
matter
where
they
said
“the
proliferation
of
religions
with
an
infinite
variety
of
tenets
would
if
the
state
is
required
as
an
employer
to
accommodate
each
employee's
particular
scruple
place
an
intolerable
burden
upon
the
state
and
accommodation
was
not
required.
it
is
submitted
that
the
eeoc
approach
also
places
an
intolerable
burden
upon
the
private
employers
of
america
if
the
court
should
accept
the
eeoc
version
of
the
law.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
only
intolerable;
it
is
illegal
under
our
constitution
and
under
our
laws.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
an
action
for
money
damages
and
reinstatement
of
position
brought
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
respondent
reynolds
metals
company
discharged
petitioner
dewey
because
he
violated
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
by
his
union
and
his
employer
reynolds
metals
company.
the
violation
consisted
of
his
refusing
to
work
on
three
overtime
sunday
assignments
when
assigned
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
his
refusing
each
of
the
sundays
in
question
to
arrange
for
a
replacement.
this
was
an
ultimate
procedure
which
had
been
extensively
used
by
all
employees
including
petitioner
dewey.
if
you’ll
bear
with
me
and
we
feel
strongly
about
this,
there
are
six
separate
grounds
which
establish
in
this
matter
that
the
respondent
did
not
violate
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
outline
them
and
then
go
to
them.
one,
in
this
case,
the
discharge
did
not
violate
the
civil
rights
act
in
anyway.
two,
the
act
itself,
the
civil
rights
act
itself
contains
a
number
of
exemptions,
exceptions
and
limitations.
reynolds
falls
within
the
particular
exception.
three,
the
government
through
the
eeoc
has
stated
that
the
prohibition
against
discrimination
for
religious
reasons
includes
an
obligation
to
accommodate
religious
group
also.
respondent
argues
there
is
no
legal
basis
under
this
act
for
an
accommodation
and
the
enforcement
of
accommodation
by
the
eeoc
may
well
be
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
four,
even
if
accommodation
required
as
a
part
of
prohibition
against
discrimination
the
eeoc
has
issued
guidelines
which
in
two
instances
in
1966
read
up
by
the
conduct
the
reynolds
metals
company
and
in
a
third
part
of
the
1966
guideline,
we
accommodated
in
the
words
of
that
act.
five,
because
of
the
wording
of
the
act
itself
which
call
in
the
remedial
section
thereof
requiring
intentional
violation
which
mr.
wallace
just
referred
to,
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
right
under
the
law
to
reinstatement
of
back
pay.
and
finally
under
the
election
of
remedies
theory,
the
case
shouldn’t
even
be
here
as
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
indicated,
but
i
would
say
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
ruling
on
this
case
went
to
the
merits
first
and
then
to
the
procedure
and
so
it's
well
done
in
our
estimation
at
this
point
that
the
whole
matter
can
be
clarified
because
the
individual
involved,
the
petitioner
does
not
suffer
on
the
procedural
basis,
you
have
before
you
both
the
merits
and
the
procedure.
i’d
like
to
go
to
the
first
of
our
basis.
we
don’t
think
under
any
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act,
whether
you
go
discrimination
by
intent
or
discrimination
by
effect
that
there’s
any
violation.
the
objective
of
the
act
as
was
said
in
the
griggs
case
is
to
achieve
equal
employment
opportunity.
this
objective
is
to
be
achieved
through
prohibiting
selected
forms
employment
discrimination
involving
religion,
race,
color,
etcetera.
what
is
discrimination?
it
isn’t
defined
in
the
law.
the
classical
definition
has
to
do
and
it’s
that
of
making
a
distinction
or
making
a
difference
in
treatment
between
one
employer
and
another,
based
on
religion
in
this
particular
act.
the
more
important
question,
i
suppose,
is
what
kind
of
discrimination
is
prohibited.
what
are
we
talking
about?
are
we’re
talking
about
discrimination
by
intent?
are
we’re
talking
about
discrimination
by
effect?
i
would
summit
to
you
that
if
you
look
at
the
legislation
and
i
know
you
gentlemen
are
much
more
familiar
with
it
than
i,
but
nevertheless
i
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
act
itself,
for
instance,
703
(h)
in
this
particular
act.
it
says,
“an
employer
may
have
different
--
may
apply
different
terms
and
conditions
to
an
employee,”
and
then
the
magic
language,
“if
it
is
provided.”
if
it’s
based
on
a
bona
fide
seniority
system.“
provided
there
is
no
intention
to
discriminate.
go
to
706
(g);
the
remedial
relief
under
this
act
as
envisaged
by
congress
was
to
be
applied
reinstatement
and
back
pay
and
injunctive
action
if
the
employer
has
intentionally
engaged
in
unlawful
employment.
both
sections
seem
directed
at
discrimination
by
intent.
let
me
quote
to
you,
if
you
will,
and
it
is
very
hard
in
the
legislative
debates
because
of
the
way
that
the
act
was
passed
and
the
format
that
it
went
through
the
senate
and
the
house,
but
at
the
time
that
it
was
passed
then
senator
humphrey
had
this
to
say,
and
he
was
talking
about
section
706
(g)
and
he
said
in
part,
“706
(g)
is
amended
to
require
a
showing
of
intentional
violation
of
the
title
in
order
to
obtain
relief.”
this
is
a
clarifying
change.
since
the
title
bars
only
discrimination
because
of
race,
color,
religions,
sex
and
national
origin,
it
would
seem
already
to
require
intent
and
thus
the
proposed
change
does
not
involve
any
substantive
change
in
the
title.
the
express
requirement
of
intent
is
designed
to
make
it
wholly
clear
that
inadvertent
or
accidental
discriminations
will
not
violate
the
title
or
result
an
entry
of
court
orders.
it
means
simply
that
the
respondent
must
have
intended
--
must
have
intended
to
discriminate.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
would
probably
--
i’m
unable
to
say
that
it
is
in
the
brief,
or
the
appendix.
it
is
in
a
michigan
law
review
article
that
is
yet
unpublished.
senator
humphrey,
let
me
correct
myself
maybe
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
the
legislative
reference
would
be
110
congressional
record
12723
and
going
on
to
the
next
page,
12724,
1964.
a
further
support
for
this
definition
of
intent
is
found
in
the
views
expressed
by
senators
joseph
clark
and
clifford
case,
the
floor
managers
over
civil
rights
act.
in
their
interpretation
--
in
their
interpretive
memorandum
concerning
title
vii,
they
noted
inter
alia,
“it
has
been
suggested
that
the
concept
of
discrimination
is
vague.
in
fact,
it
is
clear
and
simple
and
has
no
hidden
meanings.
to
discriminate
is
to
make
a
distinction,
to
make
a
difference
in
treatment
or
favor
and
those
distinctions
are
differences
in
treatment
or
favor
which
are
prohibited
by
704,”
which
was
later
changed
to
703
when
the
act
to
came
out,
“are
those
which
are
based
on
any
five
of
the
forbidden
criteria:
race,
color,
religion,
sex
and
national
origin.
any
other
criterion
or
qualification
for
employment
is
not
affected
by
this
title.”
the
reference
is
110
congressional
records
7230.
i
submit
that
with
this
background,
i
would
like
to
take
you
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
case.
prior
to
1960,
this
plant
located
on
the
outskirts
of
grand
rapids,
michigan
was
found
it
impossible
not
difficult
as
the
district
judge
said,
but
as
the
stipulation
says
found
it
impossible
to
work
in
overtime
situations.
this
was
because
of
the
fact
that
overtime
under
the
uaw
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
based
on
a
voluntary
overtime
proposition
as
far
as
employees
were
concerned
and
the
plant
found
it
or
the
management
found
it
impossible
to
operate
on
overtime
situations.
the
company
negotiated
with
the
uaw
in
1960
as
the
bargaining
agent
and
achieved
the
compulsory
work
clause
which
provides
for
the
allocation
of
overtime
work
equally
among
the
classification
on
a
voluntary
basis.
and
let
me
explain
to
you
briefly
how
that’s
done.
in
that
situation,
when
there
is
an
overtime
situation,
according
to
union
contract,
you
equalize,
you
go
to
the
classification
and
you
at
first,
where
there
is
an
attempt
to
equalize
the
overtime
opportunities,
go
to
the
low
man
in
the
classification,
low
man
on
overtime
as
far
as
overtime
is
concerned,
his
past
experience.
he
is
given
first
opportunity
and
then
the
next
man
and
the
next
man
based
on
his
--
whether
where
they
are
on
the
overtime
regardless
of
seniority
for
the
moment.
if
enough
people
volunteer
then
there
is
no
reason
to
go
any
further.
if
you
don’t
have
enough
people
then
you
go
to
the
low
man
in
the
classification
by
seniority
and
you
compulse
until
you
get
enough
people
to
work
the
overtime.
this
compulsory
overtime
was
necessary
in
this
plant
to
enable
the
company
to
work
in
overtime
situations
when
business
demanded.
this
is
in
the
sense,
a
job
shop.
they
do
not
produce
for
storage.
they
produce
on
the
basis
of
orders
and
as
the
orders
to
accommodate
your
customers
to
compete
with
alcoa
and
kaiser.
this
is
the
necessity
that
arises
at
the
time.
this
was
the
business
necessity
to
enable
this
plan
to
work
on
six
and
seven
days
and
also
to
work
in
a
normal
overtime
situation.
beyond
that,
the
substitute
program
was
instituted
in
1965.
by
the
substitute
program
we
mean
that
if
an
individual
wanted
a
day
off
for
whatever
reason,
be
it
religion
or
otherwise,
he
could
have
a
day
off,
but
under
the
compulsory
overtime,
the
responsibility
was
his
to
seek
out
a
substitute.
this
system
of
accommodation
was
inaugurated
in
1965,
long
before
the
eeoc
suggested
accommodation
by
guidelines.
in
1964,
1965
and
1966,
there
was
an
increase
in
production
to
the
point
where
in
1966,
the
company
worked
substantial
overtime
on
24
out
of
37
sundays.
how
did
we
apply
this
compulsory
work
clause
in
the
substitute
system
in
the
contract?
the
company,
as
the
arbitration
indicates
and
as
all
courts
agree
to
this
point,
the
company
disciplined
all
who
refused
to
work
whether
it
was
because
of
sunday,
because
of
a
problem
on
sunday
or
because
of
any
other
day.
there
were
11
disciplinary
penalty
cases
involving
religion
prior
to
mr.
dewey’s
discharge.
there
were
a
host
of
other
disciplinary
actions
for
reasons
--
any
reason
on
any
day
on
overtime.
what
happened
to
mr.
dewey?
he
worked
overtime
prior
to
1961,
but
in
1960,
we
established,
as
i've
indicated,
a
compulsory
work
clause.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
he
work
over
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
he
worked
overtime
on
sunday
prior
to
1960.
that
will
found
in
the
appendix
at
77a.
in
other
words,
this
was
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
for
that
is,
as
you
will
see
is
that
his
present
or
his
--
and
i
don’t
want
to
say
present,
but
his
religious
preference
did
not
become
apparent
until
1961,
so
he
had
no
scruple
prior
to
1961.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
don’t
think
so
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
it
would
not
be
remarkable.
the
question
beyond
that.
i
agree
it
would
not
be.
the
question
beyond
that
is
how
much
protection
should
be
given
under
the
interpretation
of
the
act
and
i
agree
that
there's
no
reason
that
we
would
say
that
one
could
not
be
converted
to
whatever
faith
one
wanted
regardless
of
the
time
in
life.
in
1965,
i
believe,
in
october
--
on
november
of
1965,
mr.
dewey
refused
to
work
on
a
work
assignment
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
at
the
point,
he
was
warned,
at
that
point
he
was
not
disciplined.
in
1966,
as
the
record
indicates,
at
42a,
stipulation
15,
mr.
dewey
in
1966
used
the
substitute
system
on
five
occasions
and
then
finally
in
mid-1966,
august
28
to
be
specific,
mr.
dewey
refused
to
work.
he
refused
to
get
the
substitute.
on
september
4,
the
same
practice,
on
september
11,
the
same
practice.
for
each
of
these
situations,
on
the
first
occasion,
mr.
dewey
was
disciplined.
on
the
second,
he
was
discipline
again
in
the
form
of
a
three-day
layoff
and
on
the
third
occasion
he
was
discharged
for
refusal
to
work
or
to
get
a
substitute.
in
conclusion
on
that
point,
the
labor
agreement
and
the
replacement
system
was
nondiscriminatory
and
was
applied
uniformly
to
all
employees
via
the
seniority
system
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
dewey
was
never
assigned
nor
denied
overtime
because
of
religion.
reynolds
did
not
discriminate
against
dewey,
rather
it
afforded
him
and
everybody
else
equal
employment
opportunity.
the
sixth
circuit
says
very
definitely
and
says
it
as
well
as
i
can
say
it
that
the
collective
bargaining
--
there
was
nothing
discriminatory
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
nor
in
its
application.
it
was
a
fair
and
equitable
method
of
distributing
a
heavy
workload
among
all
the
employees
without
discrimination
against
any.
griggs
doesn’t
require
on
our
opinion
the
application
of
a
different
rule.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
rule
as
far
as
we
can
see
is
that
we
are
looking
at
discrimination
by
intention
and
griggs
doesn’t
require
in
our
opinion
the
application
of
the
different
rule.
the
court
said
in
griggs
with
all
do
deference
to
the
court,
our
understanding
of
it
that
practices
neutral
on
their
face,
neutral
in
intent,
uniformly
applied
cannot
be
maintained
if
they
operate
to
freeze
the
status
quo
of
prior
discriminatory
employment
practices.
in
this
situation
before
this
court,
there
are
no
prior
discriminatory
practices.
it
was
a
regular
policy
neutral
on
its
face,
nondiscriminatory
in
intent
and
even-handed
an
application.
that
can't
be
anything
more
fair
than
the
policy
that
was
used
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
mr.
dewey
has
been
with
the
company
since
approximately
1951.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
20
years
--
let
me
say
20
years
to
1971
until
the
time
of
the
discharge
in
1966,
he
had
been
there
15
sir.
he
acquired
his
religious
preference,
his
religious
scruple
in
1961.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
reformed
--
the
religious
scruple
was
that
it
was
against
the
tenets
of
his
religion
as
he
envisaged
his
religion
to
work
on
sunday.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
an
interesting
point,
that
aspect
of
this
tenet
did
not
develop
until
1965.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
present
tenet
is
that
he
can't
work
in
19
--
he
can’t
work
as
a
tenet
of
his
religion
and
secondly
he
can't
ask
someone
else
to.
now,
i
don’t
want
to
go
in
to
the
thing
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
religion
nor
do
i
really
want
to
engage
the
court
in
what
is
the
definition
of
religion.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
with
mr.
dewey?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
during
the
time
he
worked
we
had
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
how
many
days
we
have
a
dispute
over.
we
have
a
dispute
within
on
one
particular
sunday
in
1965,
on
three
particular
days
in
1966.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
your
question
--
your
question
suggests
why
would
not
the
company
get
the
substitute.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
alright.
alright,
i
will
answer
you
specifically.
the
discharge
was
in
our
opinion
mandatory
as
far
as
the
company
is
concerned
in
the
uniform
administration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
that
day,
this
contract
has
both
a
contractual,
it
has
a
--
it
has
the
contract
itself.
there
are
also
in
the
record
shop
rules
and
the
shop
rules
call
for
certain
penalties
under
certain
circumstances
with
the
ability
of
the
company
to
be
more
lenient
if
they
choose.
in
an
answer,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
to
your
question
if
we
back
off
this
situation,
we
have
to
back
off
every
religious
situation
and
we
know
not
where
we
go
as
far
as
how
deep
that
exception
is
if
we
release
as
to
dewey
or
accept
as
to
dewey.
our
fear
is
that
we
lose
our
--
we
lose
our
rule,
our
compulsory
work
rule
and
under
those
circumstances,
our
last
days
are
worse
than
our
first
in
the
sense
that
we’re
back
to
a
pre-1960
situation
where
we
will
not
be
able
to
work
overtime
when
the
company
has
a
business
necessity.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
or
saturday.
in
other
words,
this
rule
of
compulsory
overtime
applies
to
all
overtime
situations
and
if
we
accept
as
to
one
individual
whether
it'd
be
sunday,
whether
it'd
be
saturday,
whether
it'd
would
be
any
given
day,
a
normal
day,
then
we
are
of
opinion
that
we
can't
apply
it
uniformly.
we
will
have
great
resistance.
in
other
words,
the
essence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
my
experience
is
uniformity
of
application.
treat
me
just
the
same
way
you
treat
everybody
else
and
if
you
make
exemptions
for
me,
mr.
justice
black,
you
must
make
exceptions
for
everybody
else
under
the
labor
agreement
or
else
you
have
disparate
treatment
under
the
labor
agreement.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
mr.
dewey
was
put
back
to
work
in
the
plant
by
way
of
injunction,
by
virtue
of
the
injunction
of
the
district
judge
from
the
western
district
of
michigan.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
no
sir
because
we’re
under
injunction.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
we
would
--
if
he
stays
there,
we’re
under
injunction
at
the
present
time,
if
he
stays
there
he
will
be
obliged
to
take
his
term
overtime
just
as
every
single
person
in
the
plant
when
that
occasion
demands.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
no
sir
we’re
under
injunction
not
to
apply
overtime
to
him.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
because
we
--
yes
sir,
in
answer
to
your
specific
question.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
injunction
sir?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
the
contract
was
--
the
contract
--
the
essence
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
is
to
treat
everybody
the
same
and
to
avoid
disparate
treatment
that’s
the
essence
of
it.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
under
the
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
my
answer
is
that
under
our
opinion,
the
matter
was
settled
when
it
went
to
the
--
when
it
went
to
arbitration
and
in
that
situation,
the
arbitrator
held
for
the
company
as
against
mr.
dewey
and
that
was
a
final
resolution
in
the
ordinary
contract
situation,
that
would
be
final.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
that’s
final
except
that
--
except
that
under
the
way
that
the
civil
rights
act
is
applied
for
the
moment,
an
employee
has
two
bites
of
the
apple
and
this
is
the
election
of
remedies
problem.
it
reminds
me
into
a
certain
extent
of
two
small
boys,
we
say
let's
go
two
out
of
three
and
we’ll
flip
and
when
the
loser
flips,
loser
says,
let's
go
three
out
of
five.
in
this
situation,
it’s
heads,
the
employee
wins,
tails
let's
flip
again
because
if
he
loses
on
arbitration
then
he
goes
the
civil
rights
route.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
well,
i’d
like
to
say,
mr.
justice
black
that
i
don’t
think
the
contract
needs
changing
because
i
don’t
think
the
law
says
that
we
have
to
do
it.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
have
to
say
to
you
at
that
point
we
would
have
to
attempt
to
negotiate
with
the
union
to
make
certain
exceptions
to
that
policy
and
at
that
point,
i
don’t
know
what
the
consequences
of
the
resolution
of
the
problem
would
be.
in
other
words,
can
you
accept,
can
you
get
the
union
to
accept
for
a
part
of
its
people
accept
overtime
requirements
on
certain
days
for
part
of
its
people.
i
guess
the
easy
answer
to
that
is
everybody
will
turn
religious
and
then
the
exception
will
swallow
up
the
rule.
but
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
you
can't
bargain
away
a
right,
but
let
me
say
that
in
this
case,
and
we
are
going
to
the
election
of
rights
theory,
the
right
--
the
right
in
the
contract
and
the
right
under
civil
rights,
now
the
right
in
the
agreements
was
discrimination
against
the
individual.
the
right
in
title
vii
that’s
alleged
is
discrimination
against
the
individual.
the
remedy
is
reinstatement
back
pay
under
arbitration.
the
remedy
under
title
vii
is
restatement
of
back
pay
and
my
answer
is
that
i
think
in
this
situation
that
the
rights
are
the
same
and
there
are
two
four
of
it
are
available,
but
you
can't
go
both
ways.
and
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
you
could
make
clause
of
that
sort
possibly,
but
i
suppose
it
might
not
be
applicable
in
every
case.
i'm
not
positive
in
this
particular
case.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rights
and
remedies
are
the
same.
the
hutchings
case
says
that
there
are
two
causes
of
action
here
and
you
can
see
that
and
look
at
the
distinction
between
the
rights
and
remedies.
hutchings
and
bowe
both
say
that
analysis
doesn’t
bear
the
amount
in
this
case
and
there’s
one
cause
of
action
or
one
claim
in
this
case,
one
common
claim
and
really
we
don’t
quarrel
with
whichever
way
you
go,
whether
you
go
the
arbitration
route
or
whether
you
the
civil
rights
litigation
route,
but
go
on
--
and
go
both
at
the
same
time
if
you
wish
but
when
you
get
a
judgment
at
one,
it
should
be
foreclosed.
and
in
that
regard,
in
that
regard
if
this
court
should
go
the
concurrent
remedy
route,
an
interesting
thing
will
come
to
pass,
i
believe,
in
this
that
the
vitality
of
arbitration
is
its
finality.
in
this
particular
situation,
if
you
go,
if
you
espouse
a
concurrent
route,
every
employee
will
write
his
grievance
in
the
language
of
the
contract,
in
a
discipline
case.
i
was
disciplined.
i
didn’t
get
a
promotion,
i
didn’t
get
my
vacation
on
time,
you
discipline
me
or
you
took
me
out
of
line
to
seniority
and
it
will
add
one
of
the
word
in
every
grievance
and
that
word
will
either
be
age
and
we
all
have
it
one
way
or
another.
it
will
be
sex,
we
all
have
it
one
way
or
another,
religion,
generally
we
have
it.
color,
we
have
it
one
way
or
other.
and
so
in
that
case
each
individual
add
one
word
and
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
too
cleverly
done,
then
the
matter
will
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
if
the
employee
wins,
that’s
the
end
of
the
case.
if
the
employee
loses,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
that
point,
he
said
that
was
too
bad
that
was
a
bad
ride,
now,
i
will
go
on
to
my
second
of
my
two
rides
to
the
litigation
route
by
statute
under
title
vii.
and
i
say
to
you
that
as
far
as
you
union
contracts
are
concerned
that
i
can
foresee
very
quickly
that
that
vitality
of
that
arbitration
as
a
final
and
binding
rule
is
gone
and
the
government
says
in
its
brief
at
a
certain
juncture,
“now
look,
what
we
really
mean
in
this
case
is
you
as
an
employer
get
a
quid
pro
quo
for
arbitration
is
a
no
straight
clause.
i
grant
you
that
but
there
is
also
a
significant
thing
that
when
you
get
arbitration
as
a
final
step,
it
won’t
be
final
anymore
because
these
things
are
the
basic
essences
of
life
when
you
take
those
things
that
are
on
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
arbitration
in
its
own
--
in
the
collective
bargaining
context
is
as
far
i'm
concerned,
i
agree
with
everything
this
court
and
prior
courts
has
said,
it's
an
excellent
way
to
keep
the
safety
valve
on
the
cap
and
it’s
the
one
way
that
companies
can
live
with
unions
and
unions
with
companies
and
they
can
resolve
their
difficulties
and
that
if
the
arbitrators
in
america
today
take
a
collection
of
these
cases
that
are
never
getting
to
the
court.
what
happens
is
when
you
get
a
title
vii
that
pops
up
and
i'm
not
disparaging
title
vii
but
there
isn’t
any
treatment,
congressionally
speaking,
as
to
how
this
thing
will
be
treated.
and
as
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
this
is
a
matter
for
judicial
discretion
as
to
how
we’re
going
to
handle
the
interrelationship
of
title
vii
and
arbitration.
i
think
arbitration
does
a
splendid
job
in
the
american
industrial
complex
today.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
oh
no
sir,
i
have
to
say
i've
been
in
the
labor
practice
for
20
years
and
i’ll
take
my
lumps
both
ways.
i
think
it’s
a
safety
valve
of
no
small
impact.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
alright,
let
me
--
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
coughlin,
jr.
let
me
say
this;
that
the
hypothetical
that
you
impose
and
the
actual
case
before
you,
in
other
words,
the
union
shop
clause
is
negotiate
--
the
taft-hartley
or
the
labor
management
relations
act
says
that
that
union
shop
is
a
--
can
be
negotiated
and
it
is
negotiated
and
practically
in
every
uaw
contract
with
which
we’re
most
familiar
the
union
shop
is
in
being.
and
it
--
and
also,
in
the
case
before
you,
the
taft-hartley
also
says
that
overtime
--
negotiation
in
overtime
is
a
compulsory
matter
of
negotiation
between
the
parties
and
it
can
be
negotiated,
so
that
taft-hartley
approves
both
of
these
situations.
and
your
question
to
me
i
gather
is
that
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
these
situations
as
far
as
religion
i
have
to
say
at
this
juncture,
at
the
present
state
of
the
law,
that
i
would
say
that
as
long
as
the
application
is
made
to
--
as
long
as
the
law
is
in
its
present
state
and
you
apply
the
law
to
everybody
the
same
rule,
there
isn’t
any
discrimination.
the
question
i
think
that
you’re
getting
at
or
what
i
sense
and
in
this
sense
is
what
has
the
civil
rights
act
done
as
far
as
espousing
discrimination?
some
say
and
i
think
this
is
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
what
they
really
did,
what
congress
really
did
was
they
took
the
first
amendment
and
moved
it
into
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
i
say
and
that
would
be
that
you
can
freely
exercise
your
religion
and
employment.
i
submit
to
you
sir
that
the
language
--
if
the
congress
wanted
to
do
that,
they
could
very
well
have
done
it
but
they
didn’t
do
it.
so
the
question
is
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
does
not
involve
a
first
amendment
transplant.
i
think
what
it
does
do
is
equal
employment
opportunity
and
it
says,
“look,
will
you
please
treat
everybody
the
same
as
far
as
religion
is
concerned.
treat
them
the
same
as
far
as
sex
is
concerned.”
for
instance,
in
martin
marietta
that
was
before
you,
you
say
--
the
court
says
that
you
can't
treat
married
woman
differently
from
married
man,
this
is
equalization.
so,
that
under
those
circumstances
--
under
those
circumstances
as
far
as
your
question
is
concerned,
i
must
say
that
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
think
that
the
civil
rights
act
would
not
prohibit
--
would
not
strike
down
the
union
shop.
in
my
--
in
summary
on
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
the
objective
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
we
see
the
act
as
equal
employment
opportunity.
however,
the
act
prescribes
discriminatory
preference
for
any
group,
minority
or
majority,
words
from
griggs
v.
duke
power.
in
our
estimation,
dewey
is
requesting
preferential
treatment
not
accorded
to
other
employees.
he
has
no
such
right
under
the
first
amendment.
he
has
no
such
right
under
the
civil
rights
act.
in
michigan
civil
rights
act
and
this
was
raised
today,
the
michigan
civil
rights
commission,
a
constitutional
body
in
the
state
of
michigan
treated
this
case
as
far
back
as
1966
and
said
that
an
employer
has
the
right
to
establish
a
normal
work
weekend
foreseeable
overtime
in
its
labor
agreement
and
absent
an
intent
to
discriminate
there
was
no
right
of
accommodation
and
there
were
no
violation.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
same
result
should
be
pertain
here.
i’d
like
to
touch
on
one
other
aspect
as
far
as
congress
is
concerned.
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
in
this
act
and
no
one
with
the
exception
of
the
sixth
circuit
would
pay
much
attention
to
them.
the
exception
to
which
i
refer
and
is
one
that
i
start
out
with
and
i
think
it
exemplifies
again
what
congress
intended.
703
(a)
specifies
that
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
apply
different
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
provided
that
differences
are
not
resolved
with
an
intention
discriminate
because
of
race,
color,
religion.
the
questions
in
the
senate
debate
are
very
revealing
and
they
ask
at
the
time
and
they
said
at
the
time
that
the
intent
of
the
act
was
that
it
shouldn’t
conflict
with
the
rights
of
seniority
nor
with
collective
bargaining
contract
which
are
based
on
bona
fide
seniority.
and
in
the
senate,
the
question
was
asked,
“well,
what
if
a
negro
were
the
last
man
hired
in
your
plant
and
you
came
to
a
layoff
situation
and
the
seniority
provision
says,
the
junior
man
will
be
laid
off
first
as
historically
it
does,
that
maybe
a
classification
of
seniority,
it
maybe
plant
wide
seniority
and
what
if
it
says
the
junior
man
is
to
be
laid
off
and
this
negro
is
the
last
man
in?”
then
the
answer
in
the
debates,
there
would
be
no
discrimination
on
that
theory
that
the
low
man
on
the
totem
pole
or
the
junior
man
goes
first.
in
the
reynolds
overtime
situation,
the
application
is
based
on
a
seniority
clause
negotiated
years
ago
based
on
classification
of
seniority.
you
get
your
seniority
when
you
go
to
the
classification.
no
one
chooses,
picks
or
does
otherwise.
you
get
it
when
you
go
in.
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
bona
fides
of
that
classification
of
the
seniority.
so,
the
assignment
of
overtime
is
tied
to
a
neutral
policy,
so
that
thus
there
arises
differences
in
terms
of
employment.
i
work
on
sunday,
you
don’t.
you
work
on
sunday,
i
don’t.
this
is
allowed
under
the
act
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
the
congress
said
this
is
an
exemption.
i
want
to
touch
on
one
other
point
and
this
was
alluded
to
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
white
and
by
mr.
justice
stewart
at
one
point.
two
things,
the
prohibition
against
discrimination
according
to
the
eeoc
includes
an
obligation
to
accommodate.
the
civil
rights
act
is
expressed
in
term
of
prohibition
meaning
that
an
employer
should
not
differentiate
between
employees
on
the
basis
of
religion,
i'll
restrict
myself
to
religion.
the
concept
of
accommodation
has
no
basis
in
the
statute
and
in
effect
is
a
form
of
discrimination
itself.
accommodation
in
its
simplest
form
means,
to
adjust,
to
help,
to
do
a
favor
for.
the
civil
rights
act
permits
the
eeoc
to
interpret
the
law.
the
civil
rights
act
doesn’t
permit
the
eeoc
to
legislate.
the
sixth
circuit
on
page
32
or
our
brief
said
that
the
requirement
of
accommodation
is
not
consistent
with
the
act.
the
stemple
case
from
california
which
was
refused
certiorari
by
this
court,
although
on
a
constitutional
question
because
the
relationship
is
the
government
to
an
employee,
also
takes
the
position
that
accommodation
is
not
necessary
under
the
first
amendment.
the
houston
greyhound
case
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york
holds
that
as
to
accommodation
one
not
need
making
accommodation
to
particularization
which
could
assume
many
variations
in
appearance
and
in
time
schedules.
and
not
only
is
their
apparent,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
that
accommodation
constitutes
legislation
not
interpretation
here,
but
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
i
think
that
authorizing
of
accommodation
by
the
eeoc
or
compelling
employees
to
accommodate
raises
a
question
of
whether
you
are
not
into
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
in
shepp,
you
held
that
the
government
must
be
neutral
with
respect
to
religious
matters.
in
gillette
versus
the
united
states,
this
term,
you
said
that
as
a
general
rule
the
establishment
clause
prohibits
the
government
from
departing
secular
purposes
in
order
to
put
in
it
premature
on
one
religion
or
on
religion
as
such
or
to
favor
the
adherence
of
any
sect
or
religious
organization.
by
issuing
guidelines
the
eeoc,
by
issuing
guidelines
in
which
religious
beliefs
are
to
be
accommodated,
the
government
find
itself
putting
it
in
premature
on
religion
as
such
and
this
seems
to
us
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
if
the
government
has
a
general
rule
as
without
power
to
support
or
favor
any
religion,
it
is
submitted
that
the
effect
on
this
case
is
that
eeoc
is
in
fact
favoring
religion
through
its
guidelines
and
such
action
could
well
be
unconstitutional.
this
question
was
raised
in
the
sixth
circuit.
another
step
and
this
was
raised
also
by
you
gentlemen
especially
i
think
by
mr.
justice
white.
if
accommodation
is
required,
i
suggest
that
the
guidelines
exempt
reynolds.
section
713
(b)
provides
a
guideline
upon
which
one
is,
this
is
a
congressional
act
of
a
civil
rights
act,
if
you
are
on
conformity
with
the
guideline,
if
you
rely
on
the
guideline
it’s
a
bar
to
actions
or
proceedings
under
this
act,
the
first
guideline
and
the
guideline
that
should
be
applied
in
this
case
is
the
1966
guideline.
employee
dewey
was
disciplined
and
subsequently
discharged
in
august
and
september
of
1966.
the
1966
guideline
set
forth
for
the
first
time
the
principle
of
accommodation
as
being
included
within
the
ambit
of
discrimination.
but
look
what
that
guideline
said
at
1605.1
(a)
(3),
it
said,
“however,
the
commission
believes
that
an
employer
is
free
under
title
vii
to
establish
a
normal
work
week
generally
applicable
to
all
employees,
notwithstanding
that
such
schedule
may
operate
with
uniformity
in
its
effect
may
not
operate
with
uniformity
in
its
effect
upon
the
religious
observances
of
one’s
employees.”
this
is
the
1966
guideline.
reynolds
established
a
normal
work
week
generally
applicable
to
all
employees
long
prior
to
the
discharge
of
dewey,
long
prior
to
the
effect
of
date
the
civil
rights
act
and
long
prior
to
the
effect
of
date
of
the
guidelines.
when
the
guidelines
came
out
in
june
1966,
reynolds
looked
at
those
guidelines
knew
that
they
were,
if
you’ll
excuse
the
expression,
“on
the
money.”
they
were
squarely
in
agreement
with
those
guidelines
with
the
exception
that’s
written
into
the
1966
guideline.
that
guidelines
sets
forth
the
impact,
it
sets
forth
the
uniformity
of
application
theory
and
specifies
that
regardless
of
the
impact
if
you
have
a
uniform
application,
you
are
free,
you
have
a
bar
to
this
action
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
case
should
have
been
taken
care
of
by
the
eeoc
years
ago
under
it's
own
guideline.
i
recognize
that
the
guideline
was
changed
in
1967,
a
year
later,
but
the
law
as
written
by
congress,
if
anybody
is
interested
in
it
and
i
know
you
gentlemen
are,
but
the
question
that
the
law
is
written
it
says
this
guideline
or
any
guideline,
if
you
are
in
conformity
with
it,
if
you
rely
on
it
under
those
circumstances
it
will
be
a
bar
to
any
action
for
discrimination
even
if
the
guideline
is
subsequently
changed
by
judicial
fiat,
by
administrated
decree,
it
makes
no
difference.
again,
look
at
the
1966
guideline,
it
says,
here
are
some
illustrations,
what
do
you
mean
by
accommodation?
it
says
we
authorized
the
employer.
the
employer
should
be
authorized
to
prescribe
the
normal
work
week
and
foreseeable
overtime
requirements
and
absent
any
intent
to
discriminate.
an
employee
who
knows
or
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
requirements
of
his
employment
will
conflict
with
his
religious
beliefs
is
not
entitled
to
request
an
accommodation
of
his
religious
needs.
we
negotiated
our
compulsory
work
clause
in
1960.
mr.
dewey
attained
and
we
have
no
question
he
attained
his
religious
scruple
in
1961
for
the
first
time.
when
he
did,
he
had
knowledge
of
our
compulsory
work
clause
and
under
the
guideline,
he
knew
that
our
schedules
had
presented
him
with
the
problem
and
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
the
eeoc
at
that
time
said
that
as
far
as
they’re
concerned,
in
such
a
situation
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
request
an
accommodation.
and
then
you
go
another
step,
what’s
the
accommodation
in
the
guideline?
the
accommodation
in
the
guideline
is
time
off.
that’s
what
it
reads
and
i
submit
to
you
that’s
what
we
have
done
as
far
as
time
off
is
concerned.
we
have
reasonably
accommodated,
if
there’s
an
accommodation
obligation
and
the
further
question
that's
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
by
the
government
is,
“look,
when
you
get
down
to
basics,
why
don’t
you
take
the
step
and
get
the
substitute?”
our
answer
is
this.
“in
1960,
prior
to
’60,
we
couldn’t
work
overtime.”
we
negotiated
--
we
negotiated
the
compulsory
overtime
clause.
we
worked
hard
for
that
and
in
1965,
it
was
renegotiated.
it
has
subsequently
been
renegotiated
beyond
this
--
beyond
the
confines
of
this
record
in
the
seven-week
strike
and
suit,
partly
on
that
clause.
disregard
that
if
you
will,
but
it's
hard
one,
this
clause.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
you
get
the
substitute.
if
we
get
the
substitute,
three
things
happen.
we
fear,
one
and
we
went
in
to
this
a
little
bit,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
at
that
point,
one
if
we
get
dewey’s
substitute,
obviously,
we
have
to
get
all
religious
--
substitutes
for
all
religious
people
who
request.
now,
the
second
step
is
what
holds
you
to
that?
in
other
words,
if
you
accept
as
to
one
element
in
your
organization
there
are
no
and
hand
holds
or
bars
to
accepting
to
all.
the
government
says
at
a
particular
point
in
its
brief
as
does
petitioner,
that
in
that
situation,
what
you
should
do
is
you
should
accept
as
to
the
religious
people
and
impress
the
other
people,
make
the
nonreligious
people
work
because
the
civil
rights
act
takes
precedence
over
the
contract.
i
submit
to
you
that
what
we’re
doing,
what
they
are
suggesting
that
we
do
we
will
be
back
here.
god
willing,
in
approximately
two
or
three
years
under
a
situation
where
what
we
then
are
doing
is
making
people
work
who
have
no
religious
beliefs.
whatever
their
beliefs
are,
we
must
say
there
are
no
religious
beliefs
and
under
that
circumstance,
the
religious
people
are
free
and
those
without
religion
or
impressed
into
work.
i
think
that’s
a
discrimination
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
think
we’re
making
our
decision
basically
on
religion.
this
is
just
what
the
act
says.
i
think
this
is
intentional
discrimination.
i
also
think
it's
a
violation
of
title
vii
and
it
is
also
a
violation
of
our
labor
contract
because
you
--
such
a
situation
would
be
making
us
go
back
up
the
ladder
and
skip
those
seniority
people
who
had
a
religious
exception.
and
under
these
circumstances
we’ll
not
only
have
grievances,
we
will
have
arbitration,
if
we
accept
as
to
religion,
i
would
if
i
were
on
the
other
side.
if
i
were
an
employee
and
i
i’m
with
uaw,
i
would
probe
us
through
arbitration
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
waiver
of
the
exception
that
we’re
doing
and
we
submit
to
you
that
if
we
were
forced
to
get
the
substitute,
these
results
come
about,
we
will
be
back
as
the
biblical
expression
is,
“our
last
days
will
be
worse
than
our
first.”
in
other
words,
we
will
back
to
pre-1960.
we
will
not
be
able
to
work
overtime
to
meet
our
demands.
we
will
be
possibly
faced
with
the
title
vii
violation.
we
will
also
be
faced
with
the
violation
of
our
contract.
so,
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
if
you
want
to
talk
in
terms
the
1966
guideline,
that
certainly
is
a
serious
inconvenience.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
1967
guideline,
that’s
undue
hardship.
i
would
say
that
on
the
--
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
that
we
have
not
violated
the
contract
under
any
--
the
civil
rights
act
under
any
interpretation
of
the
law
and
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
the
election
of
remedies
briefly
and
in
that
area,
the
two
general
theories
that
have
evolved
are
the
theories
they
were
posed
to
you
today,
the
sixth
circuit
saying
that
claims
that
when
you
have
an
employee
obtains
an
adjudication
in
arbitration,
he
should
not
be
permitted
to
proceed
on
the
same
claim
because
you
impose
upon
an
employer
multiple
legal
actions
on
the
same
claim
and
you
can
lead
to
an
erosion
of
arbitration
as
a
final
remedy.
the
second
theory
is
phrased
in
terms
of
hutchings
and
bowe
in
terms
of
the
rights
and
remedies
under
arbitration
and
under
title
vii
are
separate
and
i
mentioned
this
briefly
but
i
wish
you’d
bear
with
me.
in
the
grievance
that
was
presented,
in
the
arbitration
or
a
grievance
part
of
the
contract,
it
was
said
that
it
was
a
clear
case
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
company
in
applying
its
policy
to
a
petitioner.
in
the
process
of
arbitration
in
which
petitioner
was
represented
by
the
international
rep
of
the
uaw,
and
i
might
add,
notwithstanding
gideon
and
its
ramifications,
i
think
that
in
arbitration
and
in
those
areas
that
the
international
reps
have
most
unions
are
as
skilled,
if
not
more
so,
than
many
lawyers
and
do
a
better
job
because
this
is
their
bread
and
butter
vis-à-vis
the
lawyer
who
doesn’t
specialize.
but
i
say
that
in
that
situation,
the
union
suggested
in
that
arbitration
that
the
effect
of
the
application
of
the
labor
agreement
resulted
in
discrimination
against
its
employees
who
seek
to
be
excused
from
assigned
work
for
reasons
of
religion.
now,
the
arbitrator
found
the
employee
could
not
refuse
to
work
on
sunday
because
of
the
wording
of
the
labor
contract
and
the
employer’s
consistent
administration
as
to
all
employees
of
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
agreement.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
argument,
that
the
rights
under
arbitration
are
different
from
the
rights
under
the
law
or
under
the
statute
doesn’t
stand
up.
they
are
the
same
in
this
case.
again,
the
distinguishing
factor
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
remedies
are
different
and
i
said
before
in
this
case
the
remedy,
what
is
the
remedy?
the
remedy
in
arbitration
is
reinstatement
of
back
pay.
what
is
the
remedy
under
the
statute?
it's
reinstatement
on
back
pay.
someone
would
add,
yes,
but
you
can
get
in
injunction
under
title
vii
in
the
statutory
process.
i
say
you
can
get
a
prior
decision
of
an
arbitrator
or
a
decision
of
an
arbitrator
which
acts
as
precedent,
so
that
i
submit
that
under
circumstances,
the
better
judicial
principle
would
be
that
enunciated
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
district
court
in
california
to
the
effect
that
you
may
pursue
both
remedies
as
long
as
you
will,
but
when
you
get
a
decision
in
one
then
the
issue
becomes
moot
in
the
other
forum.
it
would
appear
that
this
approach
to
the
question
would
also
be
sound
administratively.
speaking
in
that
concurrent
jurisdiction,
it
brings
waste,
confusion,
forum
shopping
and
what
appears
to
be
an
unnecessary
series
of
litigations.
and
i
have
given
away
part
of
my
argument
in
the
sense
that
i
think
that
as
far
as
arbitration
is
concerned
and
mr.
justice
black
discussed
the
finality
of
the
arbitration,
i
think
that
we
are
in
serious
difficulty
as
a
remedy.
and
i
recognize
lincoln
mills
and
boys
market
and
steelworkers
trilogy
and
everything
that
this
court
is
said
and
it
can
be
undone
if
you
allow
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
theory.
and
then,
i
write
into
my
arbitration,
i
write
into
my
grievance,
you
violated
my
seniority
provisions
because
you
didn’t
follow
the
wording
in
the
contract
and
also
i'm
49
because
of
age
and
you
say
this
is
ridiculous.
what
it's
got
to
do
with
age?
don’t
use
age,
use
religion,
use
color,
use
sex
and
i
say
under
those
circumstances,
this
is
what
is
coming
in
this
situation
that
you
then
have
two
bites
of
the
apple
in
every
situation
and
unlike
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
matrix
of
the
civil
rights
act
is
interwoven
into
the
labor
contract.
everything
you
do
in
the
labor
contract
takes
all
the
condition
that
you
cover
involved
in
the
working
conditions
cover
the
prescriptions
of
the
civil
rights
act,
so
that
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
election
of
remedies
theory
should
be
applied.
i
read
--
arguelles
is
very
interesting
and
the
problem
that
was
raised
there
and
i
think
this
problem
that
is
raised
here
is
much
more
significant
than
the
problem
with
all
due
respect
to
arguelles
because
of
the
impact
that
you’re
going
to
suffer,
that
we
are
going
to
suffer
are
arbitration
as
a
final
process.
so
under
these
circumstances,
i
would
conclude
by
saying
that
it
is
submitted
that
the
civil
rights
act
--
under
the
civil
rights
act
management
should
have
the
right
to
establish
working
schedules
including
overtime.
the
working
schedules
in
this
case
were
applied
on
a
uniform
and
nondiscriminatory
basis.
an
employee
has
the
duty
to
observe
these
work
schedules
that
are
so
established
and
for
the
religious
beliefs
of
an
employee
don’t
entitle
of
individual
to
special
or
peculiar
privileges
denied
to
others.
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
you
gentlemen
are
faced
and
the
enormous
problems
don’t
balk
you,
they
don’t
bother
you.
i'm
a
lawyer
from
a
midwestern
state
and
i
am
overwhelmed
at
some
of
these
problems,
but
i
won’t
oppose
the
problem
that
faces
you
eventually.
according
to
the
1962
yearbook
of
american
churches
which
is
the
nearest
year
that
i
can
take
to
the
dewey
discharge
in
1965,
there
were
259
religious
bodies
reporting
membership
in
the
united
states.
they
had
a
membership
at
that
point
of
114
million
people.
the
work
force
of
the
united
states
today
amounts
to
70
million
employees.
as
to
religious
observances
of
various
days
i
selected
four
categories.
i
chose
catholic
because
i
am
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
they
did.
there
are
52
sundays
and
13
holidays,
holy
days
or
total
of
65
particular
days
where
we
could
wear
this
accommodation
may
work
in.
the
jewish
religion
has
52
saturdays
and
30
other
holy
days
for
a
total
of
82
days.
the
greek
orthodox
has
52
sundays
and
10
other
holy
days
for
a
total
of
62
days.
the
seventh
day
adventist
as
best
that
i
can
see
have
52
saturdays.
the
total
of
these
four
religions
alone
amounts
to
approximately
261
days
upon
which
the
employees
under
the
eeoc
accommodation
theory
might
ask
for
accommodation
in
terms
of
time
off.
the
problem
of
scheduling,
the
problem
of
extra
manpower,
the
problems
of
administration
which
are
difficult
in
ordinary
situations
become
a
great
deal
more
complicated.
such
an
analysis
brings
in
to
perspective
the
statement
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
in
the
stemple
matter
where
they
said
“the
proliferation
of
religions
with
an
infinite
variety
of
tenets
would
if
the
state
is
required
as
an
employer
to
accommodate
each
employee's
particular
scruple
place
an
intolerable
burden
upon
the
state
and
accommodation
was
not
required.
it
is
submitted
that
the
eeoc
approach
also
places
an
intolerable
burden
upon
the
private
employers
of
america
if
the
court
should
accept
the
eeoc
version
of
the
law.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
only
intolerable;
it
is
illegal
under
our
constitution
and
under
our
laws.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
