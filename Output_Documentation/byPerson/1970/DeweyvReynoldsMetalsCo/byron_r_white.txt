justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statutory
issues
are
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
arbitrator
that
is
if
the
court
decided,
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
outside
the
arbitration
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
there's
a
--
all
disputes
clause
in
the
arbitration
and
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract
at
any
kind
of
dispute
according
to
the
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
--
you
do
not
think
that
the
statute
creates
separate
such
program
that
is
not
subject
to
independent
of
any
--
beyond
anybody’s
powers
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
have
a
provision
that
said
no
one
would
be
excused
from
overtime
except
for
a
good
cause.
there
were
some
provision
like
that
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
said
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
like
to
same
in
argument
though,
if
you
knew
--
if
the
other
employee
said
to
no,
we
don’t
want
to
work
on
sunday,
we
must
to
take
turns
at
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
argument
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
cases
that
are
broader
that
it
can’t
be
sustained,
how
about
this
--
how
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
be
here
making
the
argument
if
the
question
was
work
on
saturday
on
a
regular
shift?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he’s
always
working
on
six-day
a
week
and
anybody
who
worked
six
days
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
ask
somebody
else
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that’s
his
present?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
employer
here
would
be
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
religion
if
he
permitted
your
client
to
avoid
overtime
on
basis
of
this
religion
and
said,
nevertheless
the
seventh
day
adventist
is
just
going
to
work
on
saturday
or
be
fired?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
employer
--
and
yet
the
employer
in
your
case
can
easily
find
a
replacement,
you
say
he
must
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
can
easily
find
a
replacement
for
the
seventh
day
adventist
on
saturday,
he
must
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
that
duplicates
all
sorts
of
company
records
and
things
like
that
and
if
has
two
employees
instead
of
one
for
sixth
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
know
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you’re
saying
is
that
there
were
some
other
employees
who
weren’t
busy?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
they
were
available?
they
weren’t
asked.
justice
byron
r.
white
available,
what
does
that
mean
that
they
would
have
come
without
any
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
would
have
come
without
the
union
even
objecting
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that’s
the
basis
that
we
take
the
case
that
all
the
employer
had
to
do
is
pick
up
the
telephone
and
they
would
have
a
replacement.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
purport
of
the
stipulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
congress
would
have
the
power
absolutely
to
pass
a
statute
which
would
say
that
a
company
may
not
lawfully
force
with
the
threat
of
discharge,
hanging
over
him
if
he
doesn’t
--
force
any
person
to
work
on
sunday
who
has
religious
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
effect
the
guideline
says
that
in
circumstances
you
may
not
override
a
person’s
religious
scruples
and
make
him
work
on
sunday?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
have
take
then
you
would
say
that
congress
could
as
it
just
impose
a
flat
ban
by
statute
and
said
that
no
work
on
sundays
for
those
religious
groups?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
we
won’t
excuse
golf
players?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
agnostic
comes
in
and
says,
“i
don’t
want
to
work
on
sunday
either.
it’s
not
because
of
my
religion
but
because
i
just
don’t
like
to
work
on
sunday
and
you
can't
discriminate
against
me.
i
don’t
have
religion
but
if
you
let
some
off
who
do,
you’re
discriminating
against
me?”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
notwithstanding
the
congress
says
that
they
have
as
much
power
to
do
that
is
that
would
to
accept
people
from
draft
on
the
kind
of
religion?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statutory
issues
are
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
