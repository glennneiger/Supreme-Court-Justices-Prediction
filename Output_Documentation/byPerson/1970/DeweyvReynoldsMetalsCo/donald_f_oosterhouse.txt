mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
it
applies
to
discharge
of
an
employee
because
of
his
religion.
the
case
also
involves
the
question
of
election
of
remedies
where
an
employee
proceeds
to
arbitration
under
the
labor
contract
and
also
seeks
to
assert
his
rights
under
the
civil
rights
act
including
suit
in
federal
court.
after
15
years
of
employment
by
reynolds
metals
company,
petitioner
robert
dewey
was
progressively
disciplined
and
discharged
for
refusing
to
work
on
assigned
sundays.
there
were
three
sundays
involved
in
1966
august
28,
september
4
and
september
11.
dewey’s
refusal
to
work
on
those
sundays
was
based
on
his
stipulated
religious
beliefs
which
prohibited
him
from
working
on
sunday.
he
had
communicated
these
beliefs
to
reynolds
sometime
prior
to
any
of
the
sundays
in
question.
dewey’s
stipulated
religious
beliefs
also
forbade
him
from
asking
another
person
to
work
in
his
place.
and
this
religious
belief
also
had
been
communicated
to
reynolds
prior
to
any
of
the
sundays
in
question.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
surely
true.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
that’s
correct.
the
question
boils
down
to
who
must
ask
the
other
employee
to
work.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
certainly
our
position
that
with
this
stipulated
religious
beliefs,
the
duty
falls
on
reynolds
to
ask
another
employee
to
work
in
mr.
dewey’s
place.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
he
had
prior
to
this
time
asked
others
to
work
in
his
place.
the
religious
conviction
against
doing
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
--
fairly
developed
and
matured
later
as
he
was
in
this
situation.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
that
obviously
presents
a
difficult
situation
in
terms
of
the
commission’s
guidelines
and
it
might
well
be
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
that
undue
hardship
upon
the
employer
would
exist.
there
are
many
possible
variations
here
and
i
would
think
if
the
employer
schedules
sunday
work
as
a
regular
fulltime
day,
this
is
reasonably
within
in
his
discretion.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
i
think
the
rational
to
answer
this
has
to
be
in
terms
of
the
undue
hardship.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
well
hypothecs
of
much
more
difficult
situations
of
more
severe
hardship
can
be
easily
imagined.
the
facts
are
in
this
case
that
on
each
of
the
three
sundays
involved
substantially
less
than
all
of
the
employees
in
mr.
dewey’s
classification
were
called
upon
to
work.
and
further,
that
there
were
two
employees
out
of
the
classification
who
were
nonetheless
qualified
to
work
and
one
of
the
days
in
question,
reynolds
in
fact
asked
one
of
these
employees
to
work
in
dewey’s
place.
that
is
one
of
the
employees
outside
of
the
classification
and
he
did
work
and
none
of
the
horrible
consequences
which
we
read
about
predicted
in
reynolds’
brief
actually
happened
even
though
on
that
sunday
reynolds
did
accommodate
as
we
say
they
should.
however,
on
that
day,
they
still
disciplined
mr.
dewey.
now,
if
reynolds
had
scheduled
sunday
as
a
full-shift
day
regularly,
we
would
have
a
different
situation,
we
would
need
evidence
from
reynolds
which
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
as
to
attempts
to
accommodate
dewey’s
religious
beliefs
in
other
ways.
would
it
be
possible
for
example
to
schedule
extra
overtime
for
dewey
on
saturday
and
on
monday?
this
would
be
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
this
would
be
a
reasonable
solution
to
keep
--
to
get
the
work
done.
now,
if
you
take
an
example
wherein
the
--
every
single
person
in
a
classification
objects
to
working
on
sunday,
i
suppose
the
employer
would
experience
undue
hardship.
although
again,
this
might
bear
some
further
investigation
as
to
possible
ways
to
get
this
work
done
within
the
requirements
of
the
company
by
late
saturday
overtime
and
early
monday
overtime
or
any
one
of
a
number
possibilities
which
might
be
arrived
at
without
undue
hardship.
when
mr.
dewey
was
discharged,
he
pursued
his
rights
both
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
starting
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
michigan
civil
rights
commission
and
following
the
timely
procedures
filing
with
the
eeoc
and
ultimately
starting
action
in
the
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
michigan.
almost
simultaneously,
he
also
started
the
grievance
procedure
under
the
contract.
this
contract
had
a
provision
for
binding
arbitration,
his
grievance
was
processed
through
arbitration
prior
to
the
time
that
he
had
began
suit
in
the
western
district
of
michigan.
and
the
ruling
of
the
arbitrator
gave
him
no
relief.
the
ruling
of
the
arbitrator
was
based
on
language
in
the
contract
which
is
not
similar
to
the
language
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
he
found
that
while
this
language
was
intended
to
provide
relief
for
occasional
circumstances,
it
was
not
intended
to
exempt
an
employee
from
every
sunday
working.
in
the
arbitration
hearing,
mr.
dewey
was
represented
by
his
union
and
not
by
an
attorney.
reynolds
was
represented
by
attorney
william
coughlin
and
while
reynolds’
filed
a
post
hearing
brief
the
union
did
not.
the
arbitration
opinion,
i
think
makes
clear
that
the
civil
rights
act
was
not
in
fact
considered
by
the
arbitrator.
the
operative
language
of
the
statute
in
section
703
(a)
(1)
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
of
course
the
arbitrators
have
different
views
in
how
much
they
will
look
into
statutes.
i
would
think
the
correct
view
on
the
relation
between
this
statute
and
arbitration
is
that
even
if
he
had
discussed
the
civil
rights
act,
the
arbitration
should
not
be
considered
as
binding.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
you
mean
not
limited
to
disputes
arising
under
the
contract,
your
honor?
i
would
say
that
that
clause
if
agreed
to
by
the
union
is
going
to
beyond
its
power
in
bargaining
away
an
individual
employee’s
rights
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
do
think
that
this
is
the
best
interpretation
your
honor.
although,
i
recognize
that
it
is
possible
to
use
a
spielberg-type
approach
in
taking
a
look
at
the
arbitration
to
see
what
actually
happened
and
whether
proper
conditions
were
met.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
dewey
has
been
working
at
reynolds
metals
company
since
the
district
judge
ordered
him
reinstated
to
the
present
date.
the
last
time,
sunday,
work
was
scheduled
at
that
reynolds’
plant
was
in
november
of
1968.
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
section
703
(a)
(1),
deleting
the
material
not
bearing
on
religion
would
say,
“it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
discharge
any
individual
because
of
such
individual’s
religion.”
the
clause
in
the
entire
section
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against,
i
believe,
defines
discharge
for
religion
as
discrimination
and
thus
the
language
is
rather
broad
in
prohibiting
discharge
for
religion.
while
religion
is
difficult
to
define
precisely,
i
think
there
are
at
least
two
elements
always
present
in
that
they
are
beliefs
on
the
one
hand
and
conduct
flowing
out
of
these
beliefs
on
the
other.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
don’t
think
it’s
challenged,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
except
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief,
they
would
interpret
the
statute
to
cover
and
protect
naked
belief
only
rather
than
conduct.
this
court
has
applied
the
civil
rights
act.
i’m
thinking
particularly
of
griggs
against
duke
power
which
was
decided
march
8
of
this
year.
and
the
court
said
that
the
face
of
a
rule
or
even
the
uniform
application
of
the
rule
is
not
an
adequate
matter
for
investigation
“but
congress
directed
the
thrust
of
the
act
to
the
consequences
of
employment
practices
not
simply
the
motivation.”
this
of
course
followed
the
court’s
doctrine
in
the
constitutional
free
exercise
of
religion
also
in
such
a
case
as
sherbert
against
verner
and
barnett
where
it
is
the
effect
of
discrimination
rather
than
the
face
of
the
rule
that
counts.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
yes
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
correct.
that
case
involved
that
kind
of
a
fact
situation.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
we
do
not,
but
we
do
claim
that
the
language
which
this
court
used
in
griggs
is
broad
enough
to
cover
more
than
the
bare
fact
situation
in
that
case
that
the
approach
to
this
act
is
to
look
at
consequences
of
discrimination.
reynolds’
defense
that
this
rule
of
required
over
time
applied
uniformly
to
all
people
whether
they
had
religious
objections
to
working
on
sunday
or
not,
we
claim
therefore,
is
not
an
adequate
defense
because
the
effect
of
this
rule
is
to
put
a
person
with
dewey’s
religious
beliefs
to
a
choice
that
no
other
employee
is
put
to
and
that
is
of
either
sacrificing
his
job
or
sacrificing
his
religious
convictions
was
precisely
this
kind
of
a
conflict
which
this
court
disapproved
of
in
sherbert
against
verner,
even
though
that
was
under
the
constitution
i
think
the
principle
of
interpretation
is
applicable
to
the
conflict
between
religion
and
employment
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
commission
charged
with
enforcement
of
this
act
has
adopted
regulations
and
it
has
by
the
regulations
adopted
an
intermediate
interpretation
of
the
act.
as
i
indicated
before
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief
would
have
us
apply
the
protection
of
the
civil
rights
act
only
to
belief,
not
to
conduct
flowing
from
that
belief
at
all.
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
very
broad
in
prohibiting
discharge
because
of
religion
without
any
reference
to
the
degree
of
hardship
which
might
result
from
continuing
the
employment
of
a
person.
the
regulations
adopt
an
intermediate
interpretation,
saying
that
a
person
maybe
discharged
because
of
religion,
if
to
do
otherwise
would
create
undue
hardship
upon
an
employer.
the
regulations
place
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
this
undue
hardship
also
on
the
employer.
in
this
case,
the
accommodation
which
is
required
by
the
regulations
could
have
been
easily
accomplished
and
i
think
that
the
employer
here
has
completely
failed
in
his
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
to
accommodate
would
have
created
undue
hardship.
the
evidence
indicates
that
there
were,
on
each
of
the
sundays
involved,
several
people
in
dewey’s
classification
who
were
not
assigned
to
work.
the
evidence
shows
that
mr.
dewey
was
the
only
person
in
this
classification
with
the
religious
convictions
against
sunday
work.
the
evidence
also
shows
that
there
were
two
persons
outside
of
the
classification
who
were
qualified
and
that
in
fact
on
one
of
the
three
sundays
involved,
reynolds
did
ask
one
of
these
persons
outside
of
the
classification
to
work
and
he
did
work.
and
there
were
no
great
problems
according
to
the
facts
which
are
before
this
court
resulting
from
reynolds
doing
that.
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
presented,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
reynolds
was
unable
to
accommodate
by
getting
volunteers
to
take
dewey’s
place
on
the
three
sundays
in
question
and
that’s
an
accommodation
even
short
of
using
their
compulsory
overtime
clause.
i
don’t
think
that
we
on
the
evidence,
even
have
to
get
in
to
the
compulsory
overtime
clause.
they
could
have
done
it
without
directing
an
employee
to
work.
they
could
have
done
it
by
asking
another
employee
to
work.
however,
even
if
use
of
the
compulsory
overtime
clause
had
been
required,
i
think
this
is
still
in
the
area
of
reasonable
accommodation
and
does
not
show
undue
hardship.
reynolds
claims
that
at
one
point,
some
10
years
prior
to
the
three
sundays
which
dewey
was
involved,
they
had
trouble
obtaining
enough
people
to
do
overtime
work,
but
this
was
before
their
contract
contained
any
compulsory
overtime
clause,
so
i
don’t
think
that
that
constitutes
any
evidence
whatsoever
of
undue
hardship
in
dewey’s
situation.
their
other
claim
of
undue
hardship
is
that
to
accommodate
dewey
would
completely
negate
their
compulsory
overtime
clause
and
i
submit
that
this
too
is
not
correct.
if
the
statute
is
as
we
interpret
it,
it
will
supersede
the
provisions
of
the
contract
only
to
the
very
narrow
extent
necessary
to
comply
with
the
act.
if
the
law
be
that
accommodation
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
religious
belief,
this
does
not
mean
as
reynolds
argues
that
accommodation
has
to
be
made
for
every
personal
reason.
the
statute
only
lists
specific
classifications.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
to
respond
to
the
possible
broad
ramifications
of
employer
sometime
in
the
future
accommodating
all
of
the
different
possible
religious
days,
let
me
just
say
that
i'm
sure
that
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
diversity
of
religion
in
this
country
when
it
passed
the
civil
rights
act
and
said
employers
shall
not
discharge
because
of
religion.
i
think
this
is
an
argument
not
to
this
court
but
to
the
congress
to
repeal
this
part
of
the
act.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
he
would
have
to
give
the
seventh
day
adventist
relief
on
saturday
under
the
same
circumstances.
now,
if
you
would
--
if
the
employer
is
working
a
full
shift
on
saturday,
and
a
partial
shift
on
sunday
-
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
the
question
is
always
to
be
decided
in
terms
of
undue
hardship
but
if
as
we
say
in
this
case
and
i
think
the
evidence
quite
clearly
shows
this,
it
was
easy
for
reynolds
to
find
a
replacement
for
dewey,
then
they
must
do
so.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
they
were
available,
stipulation
said.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
the
stipulation
says
they
were
available.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
that’s
the
way
i
understand.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
that
the
stipulation
saying
they’re
available
combines
with
the
other
items
in
the
stipulation
showing
that
employees
could
get
other
employees
when
they
had
no
power
to
compel
them,
means
these
people
were
available
without
recourse
to
the
compulsory
overtime
clause.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
right.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
that
this
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
the
statute
says
–-
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
when
the
statute
says
that
you
may
not
discharge
because
of
religion
and
certain
other
things
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
it's
the
discharge
because
of
a
conduct
flowing
from
his
religion
in
not
working
on
sunday.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
a
way
to
say
it,
yes.
the
effect
of
this
practice
was
to
cause
his
discharge
because
of
religion.
i
think
to
come
back
to
your
question
on
golf,
there
is,
when
the
statute
sets
up
certain
classification
as
being
entitled
to
protection,
there
is
at
that
point
to
some
extent
a
preference
for
considerations
or
religion,
race,
sex
as
compared
to
considerations
of
golf
or
other
strictly
personal
preference.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
of
the
parallel
to
the
constitutional
right
of
free
exercise
where
the
compelling
state
interest
has
been
adopted
and
i
see
that
the
undue
hardship
as
a
parallel
limitation
in
whether
this
is
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
congress
or
strictly
on
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
would
think
that
is
within
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
agnostics
might
be
in
the
different
category.
maybe
this
is
a
religion,
but
golf
i
think
is
not.
there
is
a
distinction
drawn
between
protecting
religion
and
the
other
categories
as
distinguished
from
golf.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
the
statute
prohibits
discrimination
on
certain
classifications
and
to
the
extent
that
therefore
people
in
those
classifications
have
a
write
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
they
are
to
that
very
limited
extent
preferred
as
over
people
in
a
classification
who
are
not
protected
by
the
statute.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
there
certainly
is
a
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
it
is
distinguishable,
yes
but
i
think
the
act
protects
both
the
belief
and
the
conduct
flowing
from
that
belief.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
you
get
the
compelling
state
interest
or
the
undue
hardship
as
a
balancing
factor.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
it
applies
to
discharge
of
an
employee
because
of
his
religion.
the
case
also
involves
the
question
of
election
of
remedies
where
an
employee
proceeds
to
arbitration
under
the
labor
contract
and
also
seeks
to
assert
his
rights
under
the
civil
rights
act
including
suit
in
federal
court.
after
15
years
of
employment
by
reynolds
metals
company,
petitioner
robert
dewey
was
progressively
disciplined
and
discharged
for
refusing
to
work
on
assigned
sundays.
there
were
three
sundays
involved
in
1966
august
28,
september
4
and
september
11.
dewey’s
refusal
to
work
on
those
sundays
was
based
on
his
stipulated
religious
beliefs
which
prohibited
him
from
working
on
sunday.
he
had
communicated
these
beliefs
to
reynolds
sometime
prior
to
any
of
the
sundays
in
question.
dewey’s
stipulated
religious
beliefs
also
forbade
him
from
asking
another
person
to
work
in
his
place.
and
this
religious
belief
also
had
been
communicated
to
reynolds
prior
to
any
of
the
sundays
in
question.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
surely
true.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
that’s
correct.
the
question
boils
down
to
who
must
ask
the
other
employee
to
work.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
certainly
our
position
that
with
this
stipulated
religious
beliefs,
the
duty
falls
on
reynolds
to
ask
another
employee
to
work
in
mr.
dewey’s
place.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
he
had
prior
to
this
time
asked
others
to
work
in
his
place.
the
religious
conviction
against
doing
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
--
fairly
developed
and
matured
later
as
he
was
in
this
situation.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
that
obviously
presents
a
difficult
situation
in
terms
of
the
commission’s
guidelines
and
it
might
well
be
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
that
undue
hardship
upon
the
employer
would
exist.
there
are
many
possible
variations
here
and
i
would
think
if
the
employer
schedules
sunday
work
as
a
regular
fulltime
day,
this
is
reasonably
within
in
his
discretion.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
i
think
the
rational
to
answer
this
has
to
be
in
terms
of
the
undue
hardship.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
well
hypothecs
of
much
more
difficult
situations
of
more
severe
hardship
can
be
easily
imagined.
the
facts
are
in
this
case
that
on
each
of
the
three
sundays
involved
substantially
less
than
all
of
the
employees
in
mr.
dewey’s
classification
were
called
upon
to
work.
and
further,
that
there
were
two
employees
out
of
the
classification
who
were
nonetheless
qualified
to
work
and
one
of
the
days
in
question,
reynolds
in
fact
asked
one
of
these
employees
to
work
in
dewey’s
place.
that
is
one
of
the
employees
outside
of
the
classification
and
he
did
work
and
none
of
the
horrible
consequences
which
we
read
about
predicted
in
reynolds’
brief
actually
happened
even
though
on
that
sunday
reynolds
did
accommodate
as
we
say
they
should.
however,
on
that
day,
they
still
disciplined
mr.
dewey.
now,
if
reynolds
had
scheduled
sunday
as
a
full-shift
day
regularly,
we
would
have
a
different
situation,
we
would
need
evidence
from
reynolds
which
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
as
to
attempts
to
accommodate
dewey’s
religious
beliefs
in
other
ways.
would
it
be
possible
for
example
to
schedule
extra
overtime
for
dewey
on
saturday
and
on
monday?
this
would
be
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
this
would
be
a
reasonable
solution
to
keep
--
to
get
the
work
done.
now,
if
you
take
an
example
wherein
the
--
every
single
person
in
a
classification
objects
to
working
on
sunday,
i
suppose
the
employer
would
experience
undue
hardship.
although
again,
this
might
bear
some
further
investigation
as
to
possible
ways
to
get
this
work
done
within
the
requirements
of
the
company
by
late
saturday
overtime
and
early
monday
overtime
or
any
one
of
a
number
possibilities
which
might
be
arrived
at
without
undue
hardship.
when
mr.
dewey
was
discharged,
he
pursued
his
rights
both
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
starting
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
michigan
civil
rights
commission
and
following
the
timely
procedures
filing
with
the
eeoc
and
ultimately
starting
action
in
the
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
michigan.
almost
simultaneously,
he
also
started
the
grievance
procedure
under
the
contract.
this
contract
had
a
provision
for
binding
arbitration,
his
grievance
was
processed
through
arbitration
prior
to
the
time
that
he
had
began
suit
in
the
western
district
of
michigan.
and
the
ruling
of
the
arbitrator
gave
him
no
relief.
the
ruling
of
the
arbitrator
was
based
on
language
in
the
contract
which
is
not
similar
to
the
language
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
he
found
that
while
this
language
was
intended
to
provide
relief
for
occasional
circumstances,
it
was
not
intended
to
exempt
an
employee
from
every
sunday
working.
in
the
arbitration
hearing,
mr.
dewey
was
represented
by
his
union
and
not
by
an
attorney.
reynolds
was
represented
by
attorney
william
coughlin
and
while
reynolds’
filed
a
post
hearing
brief
the
union
did
not.
the
arbitration
opinion,
i
think
makes
clear
that
the
civil
rights
act
was
not
in
fact
considered
by
the
arbitrator.
the
operative
language
of
the
statute
in
section
703
(a)
(1)
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
of
course
the
arbitrators
have
different
views
in
how
much
they
will
look
into
statutes.
i
would
think
the
correct
view
on
the
relation
between
this
statute
and
arbitration
is
that
even
if
he
had
discussed
the
civil
rights
act,
the
arbitration
should
not
be
considered
as
binding.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
you
mean
not
limited
to
disputes
arising
under
the
contract,
your
honor?
i
would
say
that
that
clause
if
agreed
to
by
the
union
is
going
to
beyond
its
power
in
bargaining
away
an
individual
employee’s
rights
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
do
think
that
this
is
the
best
interpretation
your
honor.
although,
i
recognize
that
it
is
possible
to
use
a
spielberg-type
approach
in
taking
a
look
at
the
arbitration
to
see
what
actually
happened
and
whether
proper
conditions
were
met.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
dewey
has
been
working
at
reynolds
metals
company
since
the
district
judge
ordered
him
reinstated
to
the
present
date.
the
last
time,
sunday,
work
was
scheduled
at
that
reynolds’
plant
was
in
november
of
1968.
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
section
703
(a)
(1),
deleting
the
material
not
bearing
on
religion
would
say,
“it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
discharge
any
individual
because
of
such
individual’s
religion.”
the
clause
in
the
entire
section
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against,
i
believe,
defines
discharge
for
religion
as
discrimination
and
thus
the
language
is
rather
broad
in
prohibiting
discharge
for
religion.
while
religion
is
difficult
to
define
precisely,
i
think
there
are
at
least
two
elements
always
present
in
that
they
are
beliefs
on
the
one
hand
and
conduct
flowing
out
of
these
beliefs
on
the
other.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
don’t
think
it’s
challenged,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
except
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief,
they
would
interpret
the
statute
to
cover
and
protect
naked
belief
only
rather
than
conduct.
this
court
has
applied
the
civil
rights
act.
i’m
thinking
particularly
of
griggs
against
duke
power
which
was
decided
march
8
of
this
year.
and
the
court
said
that
the
face
of
a
rule
or
even
the
uniform
application
of
the
rule
is
not
an
adequate
matter
for
investigation
“but
congress
directed
the
thrust
of
the
act
to
the
consequences
of
employment
practices
not
simply
the
motivation.”
this
of
course
followed
the
court’s
doctrine
in
the
constitutional
free
exercise
of
religion
also
in
such
a
case
as
sherbert
against
verner
and
barnett
where
it
is
the
effect
of
discrimination
rather
than
the
face
of
the
rule
that
counts.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
yes
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
correct.
that
case
involved
that
kind
of
a
fact
situation.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
we
do
not,
but
we
do
claim
that
the
language
which
this
court
used
in
griggs
is
broad
enough
to
cover
more
than
the
bare
fact
situation
in
that
case
that
the
approach
to
this
act
is
to
look
at
consequences
of
discrimination.
reynolds’
defense
that
this
rule
of
required
over
time
applied
uniformly
to
all
people
whether
they
had
religious
objections
to
working
on
sunday
or
not,
we
claim
therefore,
is
not
an
adequate
defense
because
the
effect
of
this
rule
is
to
put
a
person
with
dewey’s
religious
beliefs
to
a
choice
that
no
other
employee
is
put
to
and
that
is
of
either
sacrificing
his
job
or
sacrificing
his
religious
convictions
was
precisely
this
kind
of
a
conflict
which
this
court
disapproved
of
in
sherbert
against
verner,
even
though
that
was
under
the
constitution
i
think
the
principle
of
interpretation
is
applicable
to
the
conflict
between
religion
and
employment
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
commission
charged
with
enforcement
of
this
act
has
adopted
regulations
and
it
has
by
the
regulations
adopted
an
intermediate
interpretation
of
the
act.
as
i
indicated
before
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief
would
have
us
apply
the
protection
of
the
civil
rights
act
only
to
belief,
not
to
conduct
flowing
from
that
belief
at
all.
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
very
broad
in
prohibiting
discharge
because
of
religion
without
any
reference
to
the
degree
of
hardship
which
might
result
from
continuing
the
employment
of
a
person.
the
regulations
adopt
an
intermediate
interpretation,
saying
that
a
person
maybe
discharged
because
of
religion,
if
to
do
otherwise
would
create
undue
hardship
upon
an
employer.
the
regulations
place
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
this
undue
hardship
also
on
the
employer.
in
this
case,
the
accommodation
which
is
required
by
the
regulations
could
have
been
easily
accomplished
and
i
think
that
the
employer
here
has
completely
failed
in
his
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
to
accommodate
would
have
created
undue
hardship.
the
evidence
indicates
that
there
were,
on
each
of
the
sundays
involved,
several
people
in
dewey’s
classification
who
were
not
assigned
to
work.
the
evidence
shows
that
mr.
dewey
was
the
only
person
in
this
classification
with
the
religious
convictions
against
sunday
work.
the
evidence
also
shows
that
there
were
two
persons
outside
of
the
classification
who
were
qualified
and
that
in
fact
on
one
of
the
three
sundays
involved,
reynolds
did
ask
one
of
these
persons
outside
of
the
classification
to
work
and
he
did
work.
and
there
were
no
great
problems
according
to
the
facts
which
are
before
this
court
resulting
from
reynolds
doing
that.
we
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
presented,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
reynolds
was
unable
to
accommodate
by
getting
volunteers
to
take
dewey’s
place
on
the
three
sundays
in
question
and
that’s
an
accommodation
even
short
of
using
their
compulsory
overtime
clause.
i
don’t
think
that
we
on
the
evidence,
even
have
to
get
in
to
the
compulsory
overtime
clause.
they
could
have
done
it
without
directing
an
employee
to
work.
they
could
have
done
it
by
asking
another
employee
to
work.
however,
even
if
use
of
the
compulsory
overtime
clause
had
been
required,
i
think
this
is
still
in
the
area
of
reasonable
accommodation
and
does
not
show
undue
hardship.
reynolds
claims
that
at
one
point,
some
10
years
prior
to
the
three
sundays
which
dewey
was
involved,
they
had
trouble
obtaining
enough
people
to
do
overtime
work,
but
this
was
before
their
contract
contained
any
compulsory
overtime
clause,
so
i
don’t
think
that
that
constitutes
any
evidence
whatsoever
of
undue
hardship
in
dewey’s
situation.
their
other
claim
of
undue
hardship
is
that
to
accommodate
dewey
would
completely
negate
their
compulsory
overtime
clause
and
i
submit
that
this
too
is
not
correct.
if
the
statute
is
as
we
interpret
it,
it
will
supersede
the
provisions
of
the
contract
only
to
the
very
narrow
extent
necessary
to
comply
with
the
act.
if
the
law
be
that
accommodation
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
religious
belief,
this
does
not
mean
as
reynolds
argues
that
accommodation
has
to
be
made
for
every
personal
reason.
the
statute
only
lists
specific
classifications.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
to
respond
to
the
possible
broad
ramifications
of
employer
sometime
in
the
future
accommodating
all
of
the
different
possible
religious
days,
let
me
just
say
that
i'm
sure
that
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
diversity
of
religion
in
this
country
when
it
passed
the
civil
rights
act
and
said
employers
shall
not
discharge
because
of
religion.
i
think
this
is
an
argument
not
to
this
court
but
to
the
congress
to
repeal
this
part
of
the
act.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
he
would
have
to
give
the
seventh
day
adventist
relief
on
saturday
under
the
same
circumstances.
now,
if
you
would
--
if
the
employer
is
working
a
full
shift
on
saturday,
and
a
partial
shift
on
sunday
-
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
the
question
is
always
to
be
decided
in
terms
of
undue
hardship
but
if
as
we
say
in
this
case
and
i
think
the
evidence
quite
clearly
shows
this,
it
was
easy
for
reynolds
to
find
a
replacement
for
dewey,
then
they
must
do
so.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
they
were
available,
stipulation
said.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
the
stipulation
says
they
were
available.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
that’s
the
way
i
understand.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
that
the
stipulation
saying
they’re
available
combines
with
the
other
items
in
the
stipulation
showing
that
employees
could
get
other
employees
when
they
had
no
power
to
compel
them,
means
these
people
were
available
without
recourse
to
the
compulsory
overtime
clause.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
right.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
that
this
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
the
statute
says
–-
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
when
the
statute
says
that
you
may
not
discharge
because
of
religion
and
certain
other
things
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
it's
the
discharge
because
of
a
conduct
flowing
from
his
religion
in
not
working
on
sunday.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
a
way
to
say
it,
yes.
the
effect
of
this
practice
was
to
cause
his
discharge
because
of
religion.
i
think
to
come
back
to
your
question
on
golf,
there
is,
when
the
statute
sets
up
certain
classification
as
being
entitled
to
protection,
there
is
at
that
point
to
some
extent
a
preference
for
considerations
or
religion,
race,
sex
as
compared
to
considerations
of
golf
or
other
strictly
personal
preference.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
think
of
the
parallel
to
the
constitutional
right
of
free
exercise
where
the
compelling
state
interest
has
been
adopted
and
i
see
that
the
undue
hardship
as
a
parallel
limitation
in
whether
this
is
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
congress
or
strictly
on
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
this
is
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
i
would
think
that
is
within
the
power
of
congress.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
well,
agnostics
might
be
in
the
different
category.
maybe
this
is
a
religion,
but
golf
i
think
is
not.
there
is
a
distinction
drawn
between
protecting
religion
and
the
other
categories
as
distinguished
from
golf.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
the
statute
prohibits
discrimination
on
certain
classifications
and
to
the
extent
that
therefore
people
in
those
classifications
have
a
write
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
they
are
to
that
very
limited
extent
preferred
as
over
people
in
a
classification
who
are
not
protected
by
the
statute.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
there
certainly
is
a
--
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
it
is
distinguishable,
yes
but
i
think
the
act
protects
both
the
belief
and
the
conduct
flowing
from
that
belief.
mr.
donald
f.
oosterhouse
no,
you
get
the
compelling
state
interest
or
the
undue
hardship
as
a
balancing
factor.
