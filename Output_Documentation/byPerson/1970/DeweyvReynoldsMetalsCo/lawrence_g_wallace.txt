mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
case
under
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
to
be
argued
in
this
court.
the
first
two
cases
were
decided
earlier
this
term.
in
all
three
cases,
the
complaint
had
been
acted
upon
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
prior
to
the
filing
of
suit
as
the
law
requires,
but
because
of
statutory
differences
between
the
enforcement
powers
of
that
commission
and
the
powers
of
other
federal
agencies
such
as
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
was
not
a
party
to
any
of
these
three
suits
in
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
title
vii.
since
we
believe
that
this
court’s
decisions
in
these
cases
are
in
many
ways
as
vital
to
the
work
and
responsibilities
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
as
this
court’s
decisions
under
the
statutes,
other
agencies
administer
are
to
those
agencies
and
since
the
attorney
general
also
has
important
statutory
responsibilities
for
the
enforcement
of
title
vii.
the
united
states
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
each
of
the
three
cases
and
asked
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument
in
each
of
them.
and
in
two
of
the
three
cases
including
the
present
one,
the
court
granted
our
request
to
participate
in
the
argument.
now,
the
district
court’s
judgment
in
this
case
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
two
grounds.
and
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
both
grounds
and
that
the
district
court’s
judgment
should
be
reinstated.
the
first
ground
of
reversal
was
that
arbitration
under
the
collective
agreement
foreclose
suit
in
the
courts
under
title
vii.
this
holding
is
of
great
concern
to
us
because
of
the
severe
impact
it
would
have
on
all
of
the
rights
against
discrimination
conferred
by
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
specified
a
different
method
for
enforcing
the
rights
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
terms,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
has
been
no
holding
in
this
court
to
my
knowledge
to
that
effect,
but
we
think
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
conferred
on
individuals
an
ultimate
right
to
vindication
of
the
rights
against
discrimination
conferred
under
title
vii
by
their
own
lawsuit
in
the
federal
courts
rather
than
through
representation
by
their
unions
against
whom
title
vii
was
also
directed
and
who
have
also
in
congress’
view,
been
in
some
instance
is
guilty
of
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
congress
wanted
to
eliminate
in
the
arbitration
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
believe
our
position
is
entirely
compatible
with
that
approval
because
if
the
decision
below
were
to
prevail,
if
an
employee
could
invoke
the
arbitration
remedy
only
at
the
cost
of
sacrificing
some
of
his
title
vii
rights,
he
would
be
discouraged
from
invoking
the
arbitration
remedy
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
our
point
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
entirely
true.
we
felt
that
--
in
our
brief
we
also
should
address
the
broader
issue
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
say
what
our
position
is.
that
issue
need
not
be
passed
upon
by
this
court
that
we
warrant
our
position
now
and
because
sometimes
the
court’s
opinion
do
speak
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
the
case.
in
this
case,
there’s
no
question
what
the
arbitrator
did
not
purport
to
pass
on
the
title
vii
issue
and
he
had
no
authority
under
the
collective
agreement
to
pass
on
anything,
but
a
claim
under
the
agreement.
the
agreement
did
not
contain
any
provision
relating
to
religious
discrimination.
it
did
have
a
provision
relating
to
sex
discrimination
and
that
is
the
only
anti-discrimination
provision
in
the
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
provisions
concerning
overtime.
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
the
employer’s
position
in
this
case
was
supported
by
those
provisions
and
the
title
vii
suit
in
no
way
questioned
that
decision
of
the
arbitrator
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
collective
agreement.
there
is
a
salutatory
right
at
issue
that’s
wholly
independent
of
the
collective
agreement
here
and
if
the
collective
agreement
hadn’t
existed
at
all,
the
statutory
issue
would
be
exactly
the
same
in
our
view
because
congress
conferred
a
right
on
individuals
that
doesn’t
depend
on
whether
they
are
have
a
union
or
whether
the
union
entered
into
a
collective
agreement
with
their
employers.
that’s
the
point
in
this
case
and
we
have
in
our
brief
elaborated
the
fact
that
under
what
have
been
recognized,
at
least
in
the
restatement
of
judgments,
is
elementary
principles
of
the
law
of
judgments
are
directly
contrary
to
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
in
this
case.
we’ve
cited
the
relevant
comments
and
illustrations
from
the
restatement
in
our
brief
and
as
we
pointed
out
to
other
courts
of
appeals,
those
in
the
fifth
and
seventh
circuits,
have
taken
the
opposite
view
about
the
relation
between
arbitration
and
title
vii
in
circumstances
essentially
similar
to
the
circumstances
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
arguelles
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
sir.
we’ve
discussed
that
case
in
our
brief
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief,
we
don’t
think
the
present
case
presents
the
difficulty
that
divided
the
court
in
the
arguelles
case.
even
in
that
case,
the
majority
was
the
arguelles
--
a-r-g-u-
double
l
-e-s,
that,
as
i
recall
as
the
second
rather
than
first
party.
it’s
discussed
on
page
19
of
our
brief
in
footnote
number
6,
united
states
bulk
carries
incorporated
against
arguelles.
we
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
the
dissenting
justices
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
statutory
penalty
in
those
circumstances
depended
quoting
from
mr.
justice
white’s
opinion
“entirely
an
interpretation
and
application
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
we're
not
involved
with
that
kind
of
right
at
all
here
and
for
other
reasons
that
we
discuss
in
the
course
of
the
brief,
we
don’t
think
that
the
difficulties
of
that
case
are
presented
here.
here,
all
the
arbitrator
decided
was
that
the
discharge
of
petitioner
did
not
violate
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
containing
no
anti
discrimination
provision
relevant
here.
in
other
words,
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
virtually
nothing
more
than
he
would
have
had
if
title
vii
had
never
been
enacted,
a
decision
by
the
arbitrator
about
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
afforded
a
protection
or
not.
i
say
virtually
nothing
more
because
he
did
have
the
benefit
of
conciliation
efforts
on
his
behalf
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
that
those
efforts
are
likely
to
be
of
little
effect
in
a
situation
in
which
any
possibility
of
enforcing
title
vii
will
be
foreclosed
and
because
of
the
grievance
procedure.
now
we
believe
that
in
enacting
title
vii,
congress
did
accomplish
more
than
this
otherwise,
a
large
category
of
employees
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
would
be
virtually
denied
the
benefits
of
title
vii
which
to
us
is
a
very
important
matter.
although
the
relationship
between
arbitration
in
title
vii
rights
was
not
explicitly
discussed
in
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii.
congress
was
of
course
aware
in
1964
of
the
widespread
use
of
arbitration
under
collective
agreements
and
this
is
another
distinction
of
the
arguelles
case
where
you
were
dealing
with
an
old
statute
and
yet
the
whole
design
and
intent
reflected
in
title
vii
was
to
confer
an
ultimate
individual
right
to
sue
that
would
not
displace
all
the
rights,
but
would
be
an
addition
to
them.
we
elaborate
that
in
our
brief
and
this
is
all
taken
into
account
in
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
and
seventh
circuits
which
have
held
that
the
selection
of
rights
doctrine
is
inappropriate
here.
those
decisions
i
cited
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
and
their
holding
is
that
arbitration
under
the
collective
agreement
and
remedies
under
title
vii
may
each
be
separately
pursued
to
judgment,
so
long
as
double
recovery
is
not
allowed
which
we
think
is
the
proper
approach.
it
may
be
coincidental
that
the
same
remedy
is
appropriate
if
rights
under
both
the
collective
agreement
and
title
vii
have
been
violated.
in
this
case,
no
right
under
the
collective
agreement
was
violated
by
the
employer,
so
that
issue
doesn’t
even
arise.
there
are
important
differences
between
arbitration
and
the
title
vii
rights
which
we
think
justify
this
view
and
one
is
the
fact
previously
mentioned
that
the
submission
of
the
grievance
to
the
arbitrator
is
controlled
by
the
union
whereas
congress
in
title
vii
conferred
the
right
to
sue
on
the
individual
complainant.
and
it
is
significant
in
this
context
that
congress
found
it
appropriate
to
afford
protection
under
title
vii
against
discrimination
by
the
unions
as
well
as
by
employers
and
thought
that
this
was
a
comparable
problem.
and
although
in
this
case,
no
claim
of
bad
faith
when
the
union’s
representations
is
made,
it
is
not
worthy
that
in
the
grievance
proceeding
before
the
arbitrator,
the
employer
was
represented
by
a
lawyer,
the
union
was
not
and
the
employer
filed
a
post-hearing
brief
and
the
union
did
not.
we
think
it’s
significant
that
congress
gave
of
the
complainant
the
right
to
control
his
own
litigation
under
title
vii.
another
important
difference
and
i
think
the
crucially
important
difference
is
that
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
an
arbitrator’s
award
is
very
limited
and
this
is
appropriate
because
arbitrators
are
applying
the
disparate
provisions
of
private
agreements.
but
in
title
vii,
congress
conferred
the
statutory
right
on
individual
and
provided
for
it’s
enforcement
through
the
normal
judicial
processes
which
assured
greater
uniformity
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
that
right.
and
there’s
a
corresponding
public
interest
in
assuring
that
access
to
the
courts
is
available
because
the
availability
of
that
access
encourages
compliance
with
the
act
as
the
courts
have
interpreted
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
prerequisite
to
his
seeking
of
rights
under
title
vii
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
that
is
correct
and
the
michigan
civil
rights
commission
determined
that
he
did
not
have
a
right
under
the
michigan
law
and
then
he
could
proceed
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
bringing
this
suit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
federal
statute
that
is
correct.
well,
if
i
may
i’ll
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
suit
since
we
believe
that
this
court
should
also
reach
the
merits
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
second
ground
for
its
reversal
of
the
district
court’s
judgment
also
ruled
against
the
petitioner
on
the
merits.
and
our
starting
point
on
the
merits
is
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
griggs
against
duke
power
company
which
held
that
where
employment
practices
are
neutral
on
their
face
but
discriminatory
in
their
effect,
the
employer
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
are
required
by
business
necessity.
this
has
a
long
been
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission’s
approach
to
the
act.
it’s
true
that
in
the
griggs
case,
as
the
chief
justice
just
pointed
out,
there
was
a
background
of
discrimination
by
the
employer.
this
is
relevant
to
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
bring
a
suit
under
title
vii
because
of
the
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
perhaps,
but
it
doesn’t
seem
to
us
to
make
a
difference
to
mr.
dewey.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
one
portion
of
the
opinion,
yes
your
honor.
but
congress
didn’t
require
the
individual
to
show
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination.
congress
said,
the
individual
has
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
his
employment
because
of
his
religion.
regardless
of
whether
anyone
else
is
being
discriminated
against
by
the
employer
and
indeed
it
doesn’t
really
comfort
mr.
dewey
very
much
if
he
loses
his
job
to
know
that
the
employer
is
not
discriminating
against
anyone
else.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
--
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
a
significant
difference
there
and
no
employer
today,
certainly
no
institutional
employer
of
the
type
largely
covered
by
the
title
vii
is
going
to
say
that
it
won’t
hire
a
member
of
the
faith
reformed
church
or
that
it’s
going
to
fire
people
because
they
belong
to
the
faith
reformed
church.
the
religious
discrimination
protection
afforded
by
congress
would
become
a
virtual
nullity
if
it
were
limited
only
to
discriminations
on
their
face
because
of
religion
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
religious
guarantee
that
congress
had
in
mind,
the
protection
of
religious
freedom
and
diversity
in
this
country
necessarily
must
extend
beyond
that
as
this
court’s
opinions
have
recognized
time
and
again.
whether
you
want
to
cite
sherbert
against
verner
or
the
west
virginia
board
of
education
against
barnette,
zorach
against
clauson
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
that.
this
is
a
statutory
right
that
congress
has
conferred
which
we
think
is
very
comparable
to
the
constitutional
right
against
governmental
action.
it
may
not
be
identical,
but
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
warrant
for
reading
it
so
drastically
more
narrowly
than
this
court
has
afforded
in
protections
of
individuals
against
governmental
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
didn’t
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
one
of
the
best
approaches
to
that
is
to
look
at
the
guidelines
adopted
by
the
agency
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
as
this
court
said
in
griggs,
those
guidelines
are
entitled
to
great
deference
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don’t
think
that
the
acts
in
material
difference
in
this
case.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there’s
really
no
substantial
difference
in
the
governing
portion
of
them
in
this
case.
none
of
the
--
the
only
difference
of
substance
between
the
earlier
ones
and
the
later
ones
is
that
earlier
ones
gave
a
number
of
examples
of
the
application,
none
of
which
that
these
precise
facts
and
so
the
general
standard
in
the
earlier
one
in
our
view
is
the
governing
standard
and
that
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
general
standard
applied
by
the
district
court
in
relying
on
the
1967
guidelines.
it’s
set
forth
in
the
1966
guideline
on
page
41,
appendix
b
of
our
brief
and
the
commission
there
referred
to
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
accommodate
to
the
reasonable
religious
needs
of
employees
so
long
as
this
can
be
done
without
serious
inconvenience
to
the
conduct
of
the
business
of
virtually
identical
formulation
of
the
1967
formulation.
and
this
approach
which
is
very
similar
to
the
griggs
approach
seems
to
us
entirely
appropriate
here.
its
application
in
this
case
is
indeed
much
less
disruptive
of
the
employer’s
preferences
than
was
the
application
of
the
general
business
necessity
standard
in
the
griggs
case
because
there
the
employer
was
required
to
give
up
its
high
school
diploma
and
testing
qualifications
altogether
for
jobs
to
which
they
were
not
shown
to
be
job-related
and
here
are
the
respondent
is
free
to
retain
its
over
time
substitute
policy
just
as
it
has
been
applying
it
and
all
it
need
do
is
make
a
simple
accommodation
to
the
religious
needs
of
this
employee
by
arranging
itself
for
a
voluntary
substitute
for
the
petitioner
rather
than
insisting
that
the
petitioner
make
the
arrangement
which
is
a
very
minor
intrusion
it
seems
to
us
on
is
the
employer’s
preferences.
the
record
shows
that
at
least
four
possible
substitutes
were
available
on
each
of
the
sundays
in
question
and
the
respondent
did
not
show
that
it
could
not
arrange
for
one
of
them
to
work
voluntarily
in
petitioner’s
place.
it
seems
to
us,
it
was
the
respondent’s
burden
to
make
a
showing
just
as
this
court
held
in
griggs.
the
stipulated
fact
and
this
is
on
page
42
of
the
appendix
that
the
petitioner
had
managed
to
get
a
voluntary
substitute
on
at
least
five
previous
sundays,
strongly
suggests
that
the
employer
could
similarly
have
made
satisfactory
arrangements
for
the
other
three
sundays
after
the
petitioner
decided
upon
further
reflection
that
his
religion
really
forbade
him
to
make
the
arrangements.
he
had
managed
on
five
sundays
to
get
a
voluntary
replacement
without
any
power
of
compulsion
over
these
individuals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
was
right
and
i
believe
that
man
was
available
also
on
two
of
the
three
other
sundays.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
make
the
same
argument,
but
the
court
need
not
reach
it
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
--
this
case
seems
to
us,
a
rather
easy
one.
i
don’t
want
to
exaggerate,
but
we
don’t
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
argument
does
in
the
brief.
we
feel
that
in
the
amicus
brief
of
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
that’s
inherent
and
i
might
say
the
court
need
not
reach
the
broader
ground.
i
think
this
kind
of
a
minor
adjustment
by
the
employer
is
certainly
justifiable
under
the
act.
if
the
employer
had
made
a
showing
that
he
could
not
get
a
voluntary
replacement
then
there
would
be
more
substance
it
seems
to
us
in
his
argument
that
the
seniority
exception
has
a
bearing
on
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
depend
on
the
evidence
in
that
case
and
what
showing
had
been
made
about
the
needs
of
the
employer’s
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
what
kind
of
problem
he
would
have
if
this
man
were
refused
--
were
excused
from
the
saturday
work
and
perhaps
work
compensatory
other
times.
it
would
depend
on
his
business
situation.
that’s
the
commission’s
approach
to
the
act
and
we
think
the
proper
approach.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
argument
is
made
in
this
case.
indeed,
the
argument
is
made
that
this
application
of
the
act
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
it
seems
to
us
to
be
almost
exactly
the
same
preference
that
this
court
held
in
sherbert
against
verner,
was
required
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
it
seems
a
little
strange
to
us
to
be
making
the
argument
so
much
the
other
way
with
that
case
in
west
virginia
board
of
education
against
barnette
and
zorach
against
clauson
on
the
books.
i
think
actually
the
case
that’s
most
closely
in
point
of
the
sunday
closing
law
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
the
1960
term
and
in
one
of
those
cases
braunfeld
against
brown.
the
court
held
that
while
an
exemption
for
sabbatarians
is
not
constitutionally
required,
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
indeed
the
opinion
of
the
court
said
that
may
well
be
the
wiser
way
of
handling
the
problem
of
sunday
closing
laws,
even
though
it
could
be
argued
that,
that
gives
sabbatarians
advantages
to
compete
on
saturdays
in
a
way
that
others
can’t
compete.
there
is
also
an
argument
advanced
here
by
the
respondent
that
even
if
the
district
court
was
otherwise
correct,
it
should
not
have
awarded
back
pay
because
the
respondent
relied
in
good
faith
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
respondent
there
cites
a
district
court
decision
in
oregon
in
which
the
district
judge
did
not
award
back
pay
because
the
respondent
there
had
relied
on
a
state
statute,
limiting
the
weights
that
can
be
lifted
by
women.
we
don’t
think,
in
the
first
place,
we
do
not
endorse
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
oregon,
but
we
don’t
think
it
is
really
apposite
here.
the
respondent
here
was
not
in
any
dilemma
comparable
to
that
of
the
employer
in
oregon
arguably
was
in,
where
he
felt
he
would
be
violating
a
requirement
of
state
law
if
he
exceeded
to
the
request
of
his
employee.
here,
although
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
arbitrator
held,
empowered
the
respondent
to
fire
dewey,
it
certainly
did
not
require
the
respondent
to
fire
dewey
in
these
circumstances.
and
the
respondent
could
hardly
claim
that
it
felt
its
obligations
under
the
agreement
to
the
union
required
that
it
fired
dewey
since
the
union
took
exactly
the
opposite
position
throughout
the
grievance
preceding
that
the
employer
should
not
fire
dewey
because
of
this
problem.
and
so
in
sum
argue
is
if
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
act
here
in
accordance
with
the
congressional
intent
to
protect
religious
freedom
and
diversity
in
this
country
from
unnecessary
rigidities
in
the
employment
practices
of
institutional
employer
such
as
the
respondent
and
accordingly
we
asked
that
the
district
court’s
judgment
be
reinstated.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
case
under
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
to
be
argued
in
this
court.
the
first
two
cases
were
decided
earlier
this
term.
in
all
three
cases,
the
complaint
had
been
acted
upon
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
prior
to
the
filing
of
suit
as
the
law
requires,
but
because
of
statutory
differences
between
the
enforcement
powers
of
that
commission
and
the
powers
of
other
federal
agencies
such
as
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
was
not
a
party
to
any
of
these
three
suits
in
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
title
vii.
since
we
believe
that
this
court’s
decisions
in
these
cases
are
in
many
ways
as
vital
to
the
work
and
responsibilities
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
as
this
court’s
decisions
under
the
statutes,
other
agencies
administer
are
to
those
agencies
and
since
the
attorney
general
also
has
important
statutory
responsibilities
for
the
enforcement
of
title
vii.
the
united
states
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
each
of
the
three
cases
and
asked
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument
in
each
of
them.
and
in
two
of
the
three
cases
including
the
present
one,
the
court
granted
our
request
to
participate
in
the
argument.
now,
the
district
court’s
judgment
in
this
case
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
two
grounds.
and
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
both
grounds
and
that
the
district
court’s
judgment
should
be
reinstated.
the
first
ground
of
reversal
was
that
arbitration
under
the
collective
agreement
foreclose
suit
in
the
courts
under
title
vii.
this
holding
is
of
great
concern
to
us
because
of
the
severe
impact
it
would
have
on
all
of
the
rights
against
discrimination
conferred
by
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
specified
a
different
method
for
enforcing
the
rights
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
terms,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
has
been
no
holding
in
this
court
to
my
knowledge
to
that
effect,
but
we
think
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
conferred
on
individuals
an
ultimate
right
to
vindication
of
the
rights
against
discrimination
conferred
under
title
vii
by
their
own
lawsuit
in
the
federal
courts
rather
than
through
representation
by
their
unions
against
whom
title
vii
was
also
directed
and
who
have
also
in
congress’
view,
been
in
some
instance
is
guilty
of
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
congress
wanted
to
eliminate
in
the
arbitration
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
believe
our
position
is
entirely
compatible
with
that
approval
because
if
the
decision
below
were
to
prevail,
if
an
employee
could
invoke
the
arbitration
remedy
only
at
the
cost
of
sacrificing
some
of
his
title
vii
rights,
he
would
be
discouraged
from
invoking
the
arbitration
remedy
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
our
point
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
entirely
true.
we
felt
that
--
in
our
brief
we
also
should
address
the
broader
issue
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
say
what
our
position
is.
that
issue
need
not
be
passed
upon
by
this
court
that
we
warrant
our
position
now
and
because
sometimes
the
court’s
opinion
do
speak
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
the
case.
in
this
case,
there’s
no
question
what
the
arbitrator
did
not
purport
to
pass
on
the
title
vii
issue
and
he
had
no
authority
under
the
collective
agreement
to
pass
on
anything,
but
a
claim
under
the
agreement.
the
agreement
did
not
contain
any
provision
relating
to
religious
discrimination.
it
did
have
a
provision
relating
to
sex
discrimination
and
that
is
the
only
anti-discrimination
provision
in
the
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
provisions
concerning
overtime.
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
the
employer’s
position
in
this
case
was
supported
by
those
provisions
and
the
title
vii
suit
in
no
way
questioned
that
decision
of
the
arbitrator
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
collective
agreement.
there
is
a
salutatory
right
at
issue
that’s
wholly
independent
of
the
collective
agreement
here
and
if
the
collective
agreement
hadn’t
existed
at
all,
the
statutory
issue
would
be
exactly
the
same
in
our
view
because
congress
conferred
a
right
on
individuals
that
doesn’t
depend
on
whether
they
are
have
a
union
or
whether
the
union
entered
into
a
collective
agreement
with
their
employers.
that’s
the
point
in
this
case
and
we
have
in
our
brief
elaborated
the
fact
that
under
what
have
been
recognized,
at
least
in
the
restatement
of
judgments,
is
elementary
principles
of
the
law
of
judgments
are
directly
contrary
to
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
in
this
case.
we’ve
cited
the
relevant
comments
and
illustrations
from
the
restatement
in
our
brief
and
as
we
pointed
out
to
other
courts
of
appeals,
those
in
the
fifth
and
seventh
circuits,
have
taken
the
opposite
view
about
the
relation
between
arbitration
and
title
vii
in
circumstances
essentially
similar
to
the
circumstances
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
arguelles
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
sir.
we’ve
discussed
that
case
in
our
brief
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief,
we
don’t
think
the
present
case
presents
the
difficulty
that
divided
the
court
in
the
arguelles
case.
even
in
that
case,
the
majority
was
the
arguelles
--
a-r-g-u-
double
l
-e-s,
that,
as
i
recall
as
the
second
rather
than
first
party.
it’s
discussed
on
page
19
of
our
brief
in
footnote
number
6,
united
states
bulk
carries
incorporated
against
arguelles.
we
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
the
dissenting
justices
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
statutory
penalty
in
those
circumstances
depended
quoting
from
mr.
justice
white’s
opinion
“entirely
an
interpretation
and
application
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
we're
not
involved
with
that
kind
of
right
at
all
here
and
for
other
reasons
that
we
discuss
in
the
course
of
the
brief,
we
don’t
think
that
the
difficulties
of
that
case
are
presented
here.
here,
all
the
arbitrator
decided
was
that
the
discharge
of
petitioner
did
not
violate
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
containing
no
anti
discrimination
provision
relevant
here.
in
other
words,
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
virtually
nothing
more
than
he
would
have
had
if
title
vii
had
never
been
enacted,
a
decision
by
the
arbitrator
about
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
afforded
a
protection
or
not.
i
say
virtually
nothing
more
because
he
did
have
the
benefit
of
conciliation
efforts
on
his
behalf
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
that
those
efforts
are
likely
to
be
of
little
effect
in
a
situation
in
which
any
possibility
of
enforcing
title
vii
will
be
foreclosed
and
because
of
the
grievance
procedure.
now
we
believe
that
in
enacting
title
vii,
congress
did
accomplish
more
than
this
otherwise,
a
large
category
of
employees
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
would
be
virtually
denied
the
benefits
of
title
vii
which
to
us
is
a
very
important
matter.
although
the
relationship
between
arbitration
in
title
vii
rights
was
not
explicitly
discussed
in
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii.
congress
was
of
course
aware
in
1964
of
the
widespread
use
of
arbitration
under
collective
agreements
and
this
is
another
distinction
of
the
arguelles
case
where
you
were
dealing
with
an
old
statute
and
yet
the
whole
design
and
intent
reflected
in
title
vii
was
to
confer
an
ultimate
individual
right
to
sue
that
would
not
displace
all
the
rights,
but
would
be
an
addition
to
them.
we
elaborate
that
in
our
brief
and
this
is
all
taken
into
account
in
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
and
seventh
circuits
which
have
held
that
the
selection
of
rights
doctrine
is
inappropriate
here.
those
decisions
i
cited
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
and
their
holding
is
that
arbitration
under
the
collective
agreement
and
remedies
under
title
vii
may
each
be
separately
pursued
to
judgment,
so
long
as
double
recovery
is
not
allowed
which
we
think
is
the
proper
approach.
it
may
be
coincidental
that
the
same
remedy
is
appropriate
if
rights
under
both
the
collective
agreement
and
title
vii
have
been
violated.
in
this
case,
no
right
under
the
collective
agreement
was
violated
by
the
employer,
so
that
issue
doesn’t
even
arise.
there
are
important
differences
between
arbitration
and
the
title
vii
rights
which
we
think
justify
this
view
and
one
is
the
fact
previously
mentioned
that
the
submission
of
the
grievance
to
the
arbitrator
is
controlled
by
the
union
whereas
congress
in
title
vii
conferred
the
right
to
sue
on
the
individual
complainant.
and
it
is
significant
in
this
context
that
congress
found
it
appropriate
to
afford
protection
under
title
vii
against
discrimination
by
the
unions
as
well
as
by
employers
and
thought
that
this
was
a
comparable
problem.
and
although
in
this
case,
no
claim
of
bad
faith
when
the
union’s
representations
is
made,
it
is
not
worthy
that
in
the
grievance
proceeding
before
the
arbitrator,
the
employer
was
represented
by
a
lawyer,
the
union
was
not
and
the
employer
filed
a
post-hearing
brief
and
the
union
did
not.
we
think
it’s
significant
that
congress
gave
of
the
complainant
the
right
to
control
his
own
litigation
under
title
vii.
another
important
difference
and
i
think
the
crucially
important
difference
is
that
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
an
arbitrator’s
award
is
very
limited
and
this
is
appropriate
because
arbitrators
are
applying
the
disparate
provisions
of
private
agreements.
but
in
title
vii,
congress
conferred
the
statutory
right
on
individual
and
provided
for
it’s
enforcement
through
the
normal
judicial
processes
which
assured
greater
uniformity
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
that
right.
and
there’s
a
corresponding
public
interest
in
assuring
that
access
to
the
courts
is
available
because
the
availability
of
that
access
encourages
compliance
with
the
act
as
the
courts
have
interpreted
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
prerequisite
to
his
seeking
of
rights
under
title
vii
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
that
is
correct
and
the
michigan
civil
rights
commission
determined
that
he
did
not
have
a
right
under
the
michigan
law
and
then
he
could
proceed
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
bringing
this
suit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
federal
statute
that
is
correct.
well,
if
i
may
i’ll
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
suit
since
we
believe
that
this
court
should
also
reach
the
merits
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
second
ground
for
its
reversal
of
the
district
court’s
judgment
also
ruled
against
the
petitioner
on
the
merits.
and
our
starting
point
on
the
merits
is
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
griggs
against
duke
power
company
which
held
that
where
employment
practices
are
neutral
on
their
face
but
discriminatory
in
their
effect,
the
employer
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
are
required
by
business
necessity.
this
has
a
long
been
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission’s
approach
to
the
act.
it’s
true
that
in
the
griggs
case,
as
the
chief
justice
just
pointed
out,
there
was
a
background
of
discrimination
by
the
employer.
this
is
relevant
to
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
bring
a
suit
under
title
vii
because
of
the
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
perhaps,
but
it
doesn’t
seem
to
us
to
make
a
difference
to
mr.
dewey.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
one
portion
of
the
opinion,
yes
your
honor.
but
congress
didn’t
require
the
individual
to
show
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination.
congress
said,
the
individual
has
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
his
employment
because
of
his
religion.
regardless
of
whether
anyone
else
is
being
discriminated
against
by
the
employer
and
indeed
it
doesn’t
really
comfort
mr.
dewey
very
much
if
he
loses
his
job
to
know
that
the
employer
is
not
discriminating
against
anyone
else.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
--
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
a
significant
difference
there
and
no
employer
today,
certainly
no
institutional
employer
of
the
type
largely
covered
by
the
title
vii
is
going
to
say
that
it
won’t
hire
a
member
of
the
faith
reformed
church
or
that
it’s
going
to
fire
people
because
they
belong
to
the
faith
reformed
church.
the
religious
discrimination
protection
afforded
by
congress
would
become
a
virtual
nullity
if
it
were
limited
only
to
discriminations
on
their
face
because
of
religion
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
religious
guarantee
that
congress
had
in
mind,
the
protection
of
religious
freedom
and
diversity
in
this
country
necessarily
must
extend
beyond
that
as
this
court’s
opinions
have
recognized
time
and
again.
whether
you
want
to
cite
sherbert
against
verner
or
the
west
virginia
board
of
education
against
barnette,
zorach
against
clauson
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
that.
this
is
a
statutory
right
that
congress
has
conferred
which
we
think
is
very
comparable
to
the
constitutional
right
against
governmental
action.
it
may
not
be
identical,
but
we
don’t
think
there’s
any
warrant
for
reading
it
so
drastically
more
narrowly
than
this
court
has
afforded
in
protections
of
individuals
against
governmental
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
didn’t
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
one
of
the
best
approaches
to
that
is
to
look
at
the
guidelines
adopted
by
the
agency
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
as
this
court
said
in
griggs,
those
guidelines
are
entitled
to
great
deference
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don’t
think
that
the
acts
in
material
difference
in
this
case.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there’s
really
no
substantial
difference
in
the
governing
portion
of
them
in
this
case.
none
of
the
--
the
only
difference
of
substance
between
the
earlier
ones
and
the
later
ones
is
that
earlier
ones
gave
a
number
of
examples
of
the
application,
none
of
which
that
these
precise
facts
and
so
the
general
standard
in
the
earlier
one
in
our
view
is
the
governing
standard
and
that
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
general
standard
applied
by
the
district
court
in
relying
on
the
1967
guidelines.
it’s
set
forth
in
the
1966
guideline
on
page
41,
appendix
b
of
our
brief
and
the
commission
there
referred
to
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
accommodate
to
the
reasonable
religious
needs
of
employees
so
long
as
this
can
be
done
without
serious
inconvenience
to
the
conduct
of
the
business
of
virtually
identical
formulation
of
the
1967
formulation.
and
this
approach
which
is
very
similar
to
the
griggs
approach
seems
to
us
entirely
appropriate
here.
its
application
in
this
case
is
indeed
much
less
disruptive
of
the
employer’s
preferences
than
was
the
application
of
the
general
business
necessity
standard
in
the
griggs
case
because
there
the
employer
was
required
to
give
up
its
high
school
diploma
and
testing
qualifications
altogether
for
jobs
to
which
they
were
not
shown
to
be
job-related
and
here
are
the
respondent
is
free
to
retain
its
over
time
substitute
policy
just
as
it
has
been
applying
it
and
all
it
need
do
is
make
a
simple
accommodation
to
the
religious
needs
of
this
employee
by
arranging
itself
for
a
voluntary
substitute
for
the
petitioner
rather
than
insisting
that
the
petitioner
make
the
arrangement
which
is
a
very
minor
intrusion
it
seems
to
us
on
is
the
employer’s
preferences.
the
record
shows
that
at
least
four
possible
substitutes
were
available
on
each
of
the
sundays
in
question
and
the
respondent
did
not
show
that
it
could
not
arrange
for
one
of
them
to
work
voluntarily
in
petitioner’s
place.
it
seems
to
us,
it
was
the
respondent’s
burden
to
make
a
showing
just
as
this
court
held
in
griggs.
the
stipulated
fact
and
this
is
on
page
42
of
the
appendix
that
the
petitioner
had
managed
to
get
a
voluntary
substitute
on
at
least
five
previous
sundays,
strongly
suggests
that
the
employer
could
similarly
have
made
satisfactory
arrangements
for
the
other
three
sundays
after
the
petitioner
decided
upon
further
reflection
that
his
religion
really
forbade
him
to
make
the
arrangements.
he
had
managed
on
five
sundays
to
get
a
voluntary
replacement
without
any
power
of
compulsion
over
these
individuals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
was
right
and
i
believe
that
man
was
available
also
on
two
of
the
three
other
sundays.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
make
the
same
argument,
but
the
court
need
not
reach
it
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
--
this
case
seems
to
us,
a
rather
easy
one.
i
don’t
want
to
exaggerate,
but
we
don’t
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
argument
does
in
the
brief.
we
feel
that
in
the
amicus
brief
of
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
that’s
inherent
and
i
might
say
the
court
need
not
reach
the
broader
ground.
i
think
this
kind
of
a
minor
adjustment
by
the
employer
is
certainly
justifiable
under
the
act.
if
the
employer
had
made
a
showing
that
he
could
not
get
a
voluntary
replacement
then
there
would
be
more
substance
it
seems
to
us
in
his
argument
that
the
seniority
exception
has
a
bearing
on
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
depend
on
the
evidence
in
that
case
and
what
showing
had
been
made
about
the
needs
of
the
employer’s
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
what
kind
of
problem
he
would
have
if
this
man
were
refused
--
were
excused
from
the
saturday
work
and
perhaps
work
compensatory
other
times.
it
would
depend
on
his
business
situation.
that’s
the
commission’s
approach
to
the
act
and
we
think
the
proper
approach.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
argument
is
made
in
this
case.
indeed,
the
argument
is
made
that
this
application
of
the
act
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
it
seems
to
us
to
be
almost
exactly
the
same
preference
that
this
court
held
in
sherbert
against
verner,
was
required
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
under
the
free
exercise
clause.
it
seems
a
little
strange
to
us
to
be
making
the
argument
so
much
the
other
way
with
that
case
in
west
virginia
board
of
education
against
barnette
and
zorach
against
clauson
on
the
books.
i
think
actually
the
case
that’s
most
closely
in
point
of
the
sunday
closing
law
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
the
1960
term
and
in
one
of
those
cases
braunfeld
against
brown.
the
court
held
that
while
an
exemption
for
sabbatarians
is
not
constitutionally
required,
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
indeed
the
opinion
of
the
court
said
that
may
well
be
the
wiser
way
of
handling
the
problem
of
sunday
closing
laws,
even
though
it
could
be
argued
that,
that
gives
sabbatarians
advantages
to
compete
on
saturdays
in
a
way
that
others
can’t
compete.
there
is
also
an
argument
advanced
here
by
the
respondent
that
even
if
the
district
court
was
otherwise
correct,
it
should
not
have
awarded
back
pay
because
the
respondent
relied
in
good
faith
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
respondent
there
cites
a
district
court
decision
in
oregon
in
which
the
district
judge
did
not
award
back
pay
because
the
respondent
there
had
relied
on
a
state
statute,
limiting
the
weights
that
can
be
lifted
by
women.
we
don’t
think,
in
the
first
place,
we
do
not
endorse
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
oregon,
but
we
don’t
think
it
is
really
apposite
here.
the
respondent
here
was
not
in
any
dilemma
comparable
to
that
of
the
employer
in
oregon
arguably
was
in,
where
he
felt
he
would
be
violating
a
requirement
of
state
law
if
he
exceeded
to
the
request
of
his
employee.
here,
although
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
arbitrator
held,
empowered
the
respondent
to
fire
dewey,
it
certainly
did
not
require
the
respondent
to
fire
dewey
in
these
circumstances.
and
the
respondent
could
hardly
claim
that
it
felt
its
obligations
under
the
agreement
to
the
union
required
that
it
fired
dewey
since
the
union
took
exactly
the
opposite
position
throughout
the
grievance
preceding
that
the
employer
should
not
fire
dewey
because
of
this
problem.
and
so
in
sum
argue
is
if
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
act
here
in
accordance
with
the
congressional
intent
to
protect
religious
freedom
and
diversity
in
this
country
from
unnecessary
rigidities
in
the
employment
practices
of
institutional
employer
such
as
the
respondent
and
accordingly
we
asked
that
the
district
court’s
judgment
be
reinstated.
thank
you.
