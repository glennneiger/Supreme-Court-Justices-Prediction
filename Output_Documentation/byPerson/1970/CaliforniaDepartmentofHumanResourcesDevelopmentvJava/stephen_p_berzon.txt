mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
throughout
this
case,
it
has
been
our
position
that
the
reason
that
thousands
of
working
people
in
california
are
denied
unemployment
benefits
each
year
during
the
time
in
which
they
most
need
them
is
because
they
have
been
found
eligible
for
unemployment
benefits
after
a
thorough
investigation
in
which
both
sides
have
had
a
chance
to
participate.
we
believe
that
this
denial
of
benefits
after
such
a
determination
frustrates
the
fundamental
purposes
of
the
unemployment
section
of
the
social
security
act.
therefore
we
believe
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
federal
statutory
grounds.
and
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
however
--
do
you
have
any
figures
in
this
record
on
the
mean
time
of
waiting?
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes
we
do.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
well,
first
it
takes
three-and-a-half
to
three
to
--
three
to
four-and-a-half
weeks
for
an
initial
eligibility
determination
to
be
made.
then
if
an
employer
files
an
appeal,
it
takes
in
a
median
period
of
seven
more
weeks
until
that
appeal
is
decided.
so
that
in
a
case
where
claimant
has
been
found
eligible
and
an
appeal
is
filed
by
an
employer
and
benefits
are
cut
off,
usually
after
two
payments,
no
further
benefits
are
paid
until
--
over
ten
weeks
after
the
claimant
first
walks
in
to
the
unemployment
office.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
this
delay
is
limited
at
present.
this
delay
based
on
employer
appeals
to
2%
of
the
all
the
people
who
come
into
an
office
for
unemployment
insurance.
however,
involved
over
8,000
people
in
1969.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
of
course
is
not
this
case
where
payments
are
commenced.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
i
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional
in
california.
it
may
not
be
unconstitutional
under
a
different
kind
of
procedure
that
is
where
a
different
kind
of
initial
eligibility
investigation
is
made
--
a
little
bit
further.
if
a
state
like
california
has
a
thorough
initial
eligibility
determination
and
makes
its
decision
on
information
provided
by
all
sides,
i'd
like
to
go
into
that
a
little
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yeah,
i
disagree
completely
and
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
it
was
indeed
a
thorough
investigation.
there
are
139,000
claimants
every
year
who
are
found
ineligible
because
they
left
their
last
job
for
the
wrong
reason.
over
a
136,000
of
these
claimants
are
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
eligibility
determination.
only
2,000
some
odd
are
found
ineligible
upon
an
employers
appeal.
that
means
that
the
initial
eligibility
determination,
there
are
500,000
and
some
odd
determinations,
400,000
pardon
me,
some
odd
determinations
made
each
year.
a
136,000
claimants
are
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
level
because
they
left
their
last
job
for
improper
reasons,
we
consider
that.
99%
of
the
cases
are
located
there.
we
consider
that
to
be
a
thorough
and
reliable
investigation.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
well,
the
statistics
seem
to
indicate
that
it's
done
as
a
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no,
not
at
all.
those
determinations
are
based
on
information
that's
been
supplied
by
the
employer.
and
the
decision
is
made
against
the
claimant.
and
in
those
cases
that
are
impelled
by
employers,
claimants
usually
prevail.
the
two
thirds
in
1969.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
the
fact
that
employers
lose
most
of
their
appeals
mr.
justice
white,
means
that
the
investigation
is
very
thorough.
the
investigation
decides
that
the
employee
is
properly
entitled
to
benefits.
upon
an
appeal,
the
investigator
is
upheld.
now
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
before
going
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
in
1969,
64%
of
employer
appeals
were
denied.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no
it's
not
but
--
that
means
that
those
5,900
claimants
in
1969
who
were
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
determination
and
then
were
found
eligible
again
upon
the
referee's
appeal,
received
no
benefits
during
the
time
they
were
entitled
to
receive
them.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct.
but
what
i
would
like
to
show
is
that
the
harm
that
would
be
caused
by
paying
employees
who
are
found
eligible
after
this
initial
investigation
pending
an
employer's
appeal
is
really
a
rather
minimal
amount
of
harm
even
for
a
large
state
like
california,
the
figures
are
very
low
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes
it
would.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
the
statute
requires
that
the
state
procedure
must
be
reasonably
calculated
to
pay
benefits
when
due,
to
ensure
the
payment
of
benefits
when
due.
and
we
believe
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question.
did
you
--
under
your
hypothetical?
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
whether
that
would
violate
the
statute
or
not,
would
depend
in
operation
upon
how
long
it
took
for
those
decisions
to
be
made.
that
is
if
it
took
months
and
months
for
decisions
of
that
kind
to
be
made,
then
under
our
theory
of
the
federal
unemployment
statute,
the
statute
would
be
violated.
however
if
california
hired
many
referees,
hearing
examiners
and
conducted
these
examinations
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
and
paid
benefits
during
the
period
of
eligibility
when
claimants
are
entitled
to
unemployment
insurance
when
they're
out
of
work
that
it
wouldn't
violate
the
statute.
but,
right
now,
over
a
130,000
claimants
are
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
level.
now,
for
all
of
those
claims
to
go
to
a
referee
would
require
the
state
to
make
an
enormous
expenditure
of
funds
for
referees.
now
that
is
totally
unnecessary
because
the
number
of
cases
that
we
are
asking
that
benefits
be
paid
pending
in
employers
appeal
is
a
very
small
number
of
cases
relatively
at
some
8,000
odd
cases,
only
less
than
3,000
of
those
claimants
would
be
found
not
to
have
been
entitled
to
benefits.
2/3
of
all
over
payments
are
recouped
by
the
state
of
california
under
their
own
statistics
so
that
we're
talking
about
a
figure
that's
rather
minimal
compared
to
the
nature
of
the
unemployment
fund.
to
hire
a
lot
more
referees
would
be
totally
cost
ineffective.
and
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
california
would
do
that.
it
has
not
done
that
since
the
case
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
two
third
under
the
64%.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
dollars,
two
thirds.
and
it's
right
--
and
it's
logical
that
they
would
because
unlike
the
goldberg
case
where
this
court
found
that
claimants
or
judgment
prove,
we're
dealing
with
working
people
here.
and
it's
very
likely
that
they'll
go
back
to
work
and
not
be
judgment
proof,
or
that
they'll
apply
for
unemployment
insurance
sometime
in
the
future,
they'll
be
out
of
work
again.
and
if
that
were
to
occur,
the
state
would
just
offset
the
over
payments
against
future
benefits.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
maximum
amount,
the
california
system
can
pay
is
26
weeks
but
the
average
claimant
in
california
gets
benefits
for
a
median
period
of
seven
weeks.
now
claimant
who's
found
eligible
and
whose
employer
appeals,
gets
no
benefits
until
some
10
weeks
after
he
first
walks
in
to
the
office.
some
7
weeks
after
the
appeal
is
filed.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
right,
but
at
the
time
when
he
was
never
--
when
he
was
no
--
when
he's
no
longer
really
entitled
to
receive
benefits,
clearly
at
that
time
the
congress
did
no
intend
them
to
be
getting
unemployment
compensation.
he
maybe
back
at
work
but
meanwhile
when
he
is
out
of
work,
he
has
no
money
at
all,
he
may
have
no
money
at
all.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
maximum
26
weeks.
now
this
case
we
believe
can
be
decided
on
federal
statutory
grounds
and
the
constitution
need
not
be
reached.
however
if
the
court
were
to
choose
to
reach
the
constitutional
question,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
california
procedure
violates
due
process
as
well
as
the
federal
statute.
well,
i
like
to
it
very
briefly
because
--
as
to
review
the
state
procedure
because
i
really
think
that
it's
critical
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
now
the
procedure
is
found
in
great
detail
on
pages
27
to
32
of
our
brief.
that
to
summarize
the
procedure
very
briefly,
an
unemployed
worker
who
believes
he
is
eligible
for
benefits,
applies
at
a
state
office.
he
fills
out
a
series
of
forms
including
a
form
revealing
why
he
left
his
last
job.
that
form
is
sent
to
his
employer
who
is
required
within
10
days
to
provide
any
information
he
has
concerning
the
claimants
eligibility.
he
is
required
to
do
that
by
section
1327
of
the
california
code
bylaw.
and
any
statement
made
by
an
employer
at
any
time
or
any
statement
made
by
an
employee
at
any
time
is
made
under
penalty
of
perjury.
so
it's
not
true
that
they're
not
made
under
oath.
in
addition,
the
employer
not
only
can
supply
information.
nor
he's
required
to
supply
information
in
writing
but
he
has
every
opportunity
to
communicate
with
the
examiner
who
is
charged
with
making
the
decision,
either
in
person
or
by
phone
with
or
without
witnesses.
after
the
form
is
returned,
the
examiner
interviews
the
claimant
an
interview
at
which
the
employer
is
free
to
appear.
if
the
claimant
presents
any
information
inconsistent
with
the
facts
given
by
the
employer
or
any
party,
the
examiner
must
telephone
the
employer
for
further
discussion.
this
is
assuming
the
employer
doesn't
come
in,
in
appear
with
witnesses
which
he
can
do.
and
if
the
employer
can't
be
reached,
the
examiner
postpones
the
decision
for
10
days.
that's
in
the
state
regulations.
then
once
the
examiner
has
gotten
all
the
information,
he
makes
a
decision.
he
reports
all
facts
and
he
gives
written
reasons
for
his
decision.
if
he
decides
the
claimant
is
eligible
for
benefits,
payments
commence
and
in
this
cases,
it's
my
understanding
that
each
of
the
two
claimants
receive
two
payments.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes
they
are.
and
it's
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
provide
weekly
payments
so
that
claimants
have
money
in
their
pocket,
each
week
so
they
can
buy
the
necessities
of
life
and
keep
purchasing
power
in
the
community.
this
decision
takes
three
to
four
and
a
half
weeks.
this
takes
quite
a
while.
it's
not
a
one
or
two
day
decision
as
is
true
for
example,
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
a
totally
different
kind
of
procedure
that's
not
before
us
in
this
case
where
a
claimant
comes
into
an
unemployment
office.
the
examiner
looks
at
its
papers
and
decides
if
he's
eligible
for
unemployment
insurance
on
its
face.
if
he
is,
the
employer
is
notified
that
a
claim
has
been
made.
and
that
the
employer
then
has
time
to
file
an
appeal.
if
the
employer
files
an
appeal,
the
decision
is
made
upon
an
appeal.
that's
the
first
time
the
employer
is
heard.
the
whole
process
works
much
more
quickly.
to
stay
there
pending
an
appeal
is
a
state
to
give
the
employer
chance
to
be
heard
not
after
there
has
been
an
investigation.
california's
own
regulations
on
page
116
of
the
appendix
state
very,
very
clear
language.
the
initial
determination
resolves
all
issues
involving
initial
eligibility.
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
eligibility
determination
was
very
thorough.
and
payments
commenced
at
the
initial
eligibility
investigation,
after
the
initial
eligibility
investigation,
the
worker
begins
receiving
benefits.
if
an
employer
then
files
an
appeal
at
any
time,
even
long
after
the
ten
days
that
he
has
to
file
an
appeal
has
expired,
benefits
are
cut
off
and
it
doesn't
matter
why
he
files
an
appeal.
he
can
dislike
the
employee.
any
reason
he
files
an
appeal
and
until
a
hearing
is
heard
which
is
--
over
50%
of
the
cases
is
more
than
10
weeks.
10
weeks
is
just
the
median.
no
benefits
are
paid
from
10
weeks
--
till
10
weeks
after
the
time
the
claimant
first
walks
into
the
office.
and
the
claimant
gets
no
funds.
the
employer
has
nothing
at
all
to
lose
in
filing
this
appeal.
his
unemployment,
he
has
everything
to
gain.
his
unemployment
taxes
are
based
according
to
his
record
as
an
employer.
that
is
that
he
pays
taxes
based
on
how
many
of
his
former
employees
get
benefits.
therefore,
he
does
have
an
interest
in
preventing
his
former
employees
from
receiving
benefits.
however,
he
loses
nothing,
absolutely
nothing,
the
individual
employer
if
payments
are
made
pending
appeal.
because
if
the
employer
wins
his
appeal,
at
any
level
including
judicial
review
in
the
state
of
california,
his
account
is
credited
as
if
his
employee
has
never
received
any
benefits.
therefore,
he
gains
nothing
by
the
suspension
but
he
has
every
reason
to
appeal
and
cut
off
his
employee's
funds
to
protect
his
record.
therefore
the
procedure
we
are
dealing
with
cuts
off
vitally
needed
benefits
on
the
basis
of
a
unilateral
fortuitous
act
by
one
with
an
adverse
private
interest.
and
it
does
so;
despite
carefully
made
and
fully
informed
decision
to
the
contrary
by
a
neutral
state
agency.
the
state
determines
them
eligible.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
is
true
but
that's
distinguishable
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
federal
statutory
question.
but
under
the
constitutional
question
that
a
tort
action
or
contract
action
against
an
insurance
company
is
totally
different
mr.
chief
justice
from
an
action
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
okay.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
this
is
not
an
insurance
claim
in
the
sense
of
private
insurance.
this
is
a
claim
against
the
state
for
benefits
which
the
state
is
paying
under
a
statute
designed
to
meet
a
particular
kind
of
problem.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes,
it
has
a
relationship.
the
difference
is
that
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
contract
action
in
a
court
of
law
that
benefits
are
not
necessarily
paid
at
a
particular
period
of
time.
lawsuits
are
by
nature
time
consuming,
payments
are
always
made
retroactively.
that
is
your
honor,
that
if
the
claimant
is
determined
eligible
and
the
insurance
–
the
court
says,
the
insurance
company
has
to
pay,
payments
are
always
retroactive.
that's
the
nature
of
the
game.
but
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
unemployment
insurance,
benefits
are
supposed
to
be
paid
in
a
weekly
manner.
time
is
very
critical.
the
congress
intended
these
benefits
to
be
made
at
a
particular
point
in
time
while
the
worker
is
out
of
work
before
he
finds
a
new
job.
that
is
not
true
with
respect
to
insurance
claims.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
is
a
very
strong
point
your
honor.
i
would
just
add
one
point
to
that,
that
a
corollary
to
that
was
filling
in
a
gap
for
those
claimants
who
are
not
eligible
to
receive
welfare
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
the
1935
congress
faced
with
a
desperate
economic
situation,
saw
two
distinct
groups
of
people
who
were
without
wages
and
without
liquid
assets.
they
saw
people
who
realty
couldn't
work,
old
people,
blind
people,
young
people,
disabled
people
and
they
also
saw
workers
who
couldn't
find
a
job
who
may
have
been
in
an
identical
economic
position
and
in
fact
this
court
held
and
explained
in
stewart
and
justifying
the
unemployment
compensation
law,
the
federal
act
that
the
congress
passed
the
act
because
workers
were
starving.
the
congress
did
not
want
to
lump
welfare
recipients
or
lump
non
workers
and
workers
into
one
program.
they
did
not
want
workers
to
go
on
a
dole
for
many
reasons.
and
therefore
what
the
congress
did
was
it
set
up
a
separate
program
for
unemployed
workers,
that
would
pay
them
benefits
at
a
particular
point
in
time,
they
would
work
for
these
benefits,
they
would
be
there.
hopefully
they
would
find
a
new
job
rather
quickly
and
then
they
would
be
off
benefits.
in
fact
they
have
to
be
off
benefits
rather
quickly.
and
since
the
congress
didn't
provide
welfare
for
these
people,
they
may
be
absolutely
penny
less
and
not
be
able
to
get
on
welfare.
and
therefore
there
is
a
gap
and
this
is
different
from
an
insurance
company
for
both
kind
of
situation
for
those
two
reasons.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
900,000
people
applied
the
initial
level.
there
are
roughly
500,000
to
600,000
determinations
made
initially
and
some
350,000
to
400,000
are
considered
eligible.
so
it
would
be
400,000
out
of
900,000.
now
the
reason
for
the
gap
between
determinations
and
between
people
who
come
in
to
the
office
is
that
many
people
who
come
in
to
the
office
aren't
eligible
because
they
haven't
worked
enough
weeks
or
made
enough
money.
so
that
they
are
--
they
are
just
eliminated
immediately,
then
in
other
cases,
employers
provide
no
information
and
it's
clear
that
a
claimant
has
a
valid
claim,
so
no
determination
is
made.
but
in
600,000
cases
i
believe
where
determinations
are
made,
some
400,000
are
determined
eligible,
some
200,000
are
determined
ineligible.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yeah.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
now
these
are
the
--
these
are
the
first
200,000
from
900,000
to
600,000?
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yeah.
most
of
them
because
they
haven't
earned
enough
money,
they
are
just
immediately
eliminated.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no.
those
statistics
aren't
in
the
record.
we
only
know
the
number
of
initial
determinations
in
1968,
960,000
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
but
under
the
constitution,
that's
a
very
--
that
would
be
a
very
close
case.
the
individual
builds
up
a
great
reliance
interest,
once
payments
do
begin
and
the
spectrum
of
interest
does
change.
he
gets
payments
for
one
or
for
two
weeks
and
habits
are
formed.
on
the
other
hand,
there
hasn't
been
a
thorough
investigation
as
there
has
been
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
there
hasn't
really
been
the
same
kind
of
determination
that
is
not
so
arbitrary
a
process.
i
would
imagine
that
the
fact
that
payments
are
made
alone
is
not
totally
--
it's
totally
determined.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
to
a
great
--
it
depends
on
that,
plus
the
fact
that
the
state
has
begun
making
the
payments
in
this
case.
the
state
has
chosen
to
make
the
payments,
it
begins
on
both.
it
hinges
on
both.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
because
both
sides
have
been
heard
and
that's
because
the
initial
determination
is
so
thorough.
yes,
the
initial
determination
is
critical
to
this
case.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
is
correct.
the
employer
is
not
charged.
the
only
part
he
charged
in
that
case
is
the
state
which
must
pay,
which
must
recoup
benefits
and
does
recoup
2/3.
now,
employers
do
have
an
interest
in
the
sense
that
while
the
reserved
account
is
not
charged.
all
over
payments
come
out
of
a
general
state
fund
and
that
it's
conceivable
that
as
a
tax
payer
group,
their
general
taxes
could
go
up
but
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
for
everybody,
300,000
employees.
not
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no,
the
employer
has
no
property
interest.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
the
only
property
interest
that
employer
has,
is
the
property
interest,
let's
say
of
a
property
tax
payer,
it's
school
expenditures
are
made,
or
the
property
interest
of
someone
who
uses
roads,
if
highway
expenditures
are
made.
the
employer
--
the
300,000
employers
are
interested
in
the
fund
in
the
sense
that
they
don't
want
it
to
plead
and
their
tax
could
conceivably
go
up.
but
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
possible
amount
of
over
payments
due
to
the
recoupment
rate
and
the
limited
nature
of
this
case
and
that
it's
the
employees
have
been
found
eligible.
and
it's
employers,
not
employees
who
are
appealing,
the
limited
nature
of
this
case
that
the
maximum
amount
of
over
payments
to
the
state
of
california
in
1969
would
have
been
some
$335,000.00.
the
reserve
fund
presently
has
1
billion
for
--
some
$304,000,000.00
and
since
this
case
is
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
employer
has
absolutely
no
doubt
a
constitutional
claim.
he
is
given
a
full
hearing
before
his
account
is
charged.
and
as
far
as
his
interest
in
the
property
that
is
his
interest
in
the
general
tax
fund,
his
ability
to
participate
in
the
initial
determination
certainly
needs
any
objection
he
might
have
as
a
tax
payer.
in
the
kanes
(ph)
case
back
in
the
mid
40's,
this
court
held
that
an
employer
in
a
similar
position
with
respect
to
workmen's
compensation
did
not
have
a
sufficient
due
process
interest
to
have
standing
to
bring
a
lawsuit
based
on
depletion
of
the
fund.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
oh,
yes
they
would
your
honor.
in
california,
the
employer
has
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct
except
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
they
are,
except
we've
got
to
analyze
why
california
is
withholding
benefits
pending
this
appeal
and
when
we
break
this
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
this
is
identical
to
goldberg
and
kelly
your
honor,
except
it
is
a
stronger
case.
it
is
squarely
controlled
by
goldberg
and
kelly.
in
this
case,
just
like
in
goldberg
and
kelly,
benefits,
this
rigorous
initial
eligibility
determination
has
begun,
benefits
have
been
commenced
and
benefits
have
then
been
cut
off.
and
the
difference
between
this
case
in
goldberg
and
kelly
makes
this
case
even
stronger.
the
individual
interest
in
this
case
is
much
like
the
individual
interest
in
goldberg.
the
benefit
serve
the
same
purpose
as
welfare
benefits.
the
median
income,
unemployment
compensation
recipients
is
some
$3,900.00
a
year.
and
for
family
of
four,
there
are
no
liquid
assets
with
the
median
income
of
that
kind.
the
situation
is
the
same
except
for
this
fact.
in
goldberg,
the
situation
involved
poor
people
and
in
this
case,
the
situation
involved
working
poor
people
who've
actually
been
at
work
and
who've
been
promised
these
benefits
in
the
event
that
they
would
be
suddenly
out
of
work.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
it
is
true
that
some
may
not
be
but
the
congress
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
well
in
california
right
now,
that's
true
that
there
is
a
high
aerospace
unemployment
rate
but
the
median
unemployment
--
the
median
income
figure
for
unemployment
recipients
that
i
gave
is
in
california
your
honor,
$3,900.00
for
a
family
of
four.
that's
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
it
would
reach
it,
because
the
reason
that
congress
--
the
reason
that
congress
setup
this
scheme
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct,
for
the
each
individual
case.
however,
the
reason
the
1935
congress
setup
this
scheme
your
honor
was
precisely
because
it
believed
that
people
in
this
position
were
in
desperate
need
of
funds.
now
in
each
individual
case
it's
true
that
it's
not
critical.
this
case
your
honor
is
much
stronger
than
goldberg
and
kelly
for
two
additional
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
interest
of
the
state
are
far
less
as
i
have
mentioned
before.
recoupment
is
available
in
this
kind
of
a
case
and
secondly,
more
so
that
the
interest
of
the
employers
are
not
very
great.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
mainly
because
workers
on
unemployment
compensation
tend
to
be
out
of
work
again.
they
are
the
working
poor,
the
marginally
unemployed.
and
the
state
can
offset
payments
--
over
payments
against
future
benefits.
but
the
state's
figures
tell
us
that
at
64%.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
there
are
exceptions
in
every
case,
there
are
obviously
some
over
payments
that
aren't
recouped,
some
one-third
are
not
recouped.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
throughout
this
case,
it
has
been
our
position
that
the
reason
that
thousands
of
working
people
in
california
are
denied
unemployment
benefits
each
year
during
the
time
in
which
they
most
need
them
is
because
they
have
been
found
eligible
for
unemployment
benefits
after
a
thorough
investigation
in
which
both
sides
have
had
a
chance
to
participate.
we
believe
that
this
denial
of
benefits
after
such
a
determination
frustrates
the
fundamental
purposes
of
the
unemployment
section
of
the
social
security
act.
therefore
we
believe
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
federal
statutory
grounds.
and
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
however
--
do
you
have
any
figures
in
this
record
on
the
mean
time
of
waiting?
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes
we
do.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
well,
first
it
takes
three-and-a-half
to
three
to
--
three
to
four-and-a-half
weeks
for
an
initial
eligibility
determination
to
be
made.
then
if
an
employer
files
an
appeal,
it
takes
in
a
median
period
of
seven
more
weeks
until
that
appeal
is
decided.
so
that
in
a
case
where
claimant
has
been
found
eligible
and
an
appeal
is
filed
by
an
employer
and
benefits
are
cut
off,
usually
after
two
payments,
no
further
benefits
are
paid
until
--
over
ten
weeks
after
the
claimant
first
walks
in
to
the
unemployment
office.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
this
delay
is
limited
at
present.
this
delay
based
on
employer
appeals
to
2%
of
the
all
the
people
who
come
into
an
office
for
unemployment
insurance.
however,
involved
over
8,000
people
in
1969.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
of
course
is
not
this
case
where
payments
are
commenced.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
i
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional
in
california.
it
may
not
be
unconstitutional
under
a
different
kind
of
procedure
that
is
where
a
different
kind
of
initial
eligibility
investigation
is
made
--
a
little
bit
further.
if
a
state
like
california
has
a
thorough
initial
eligibility
determination
and
makes
its
decision
on
information
provided
by
all
sides,
i'd
like
to
go
into
that
a
little
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yeah,
i
disagree
completely
and
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
it
was
indeed
a
thorough
investigation.
there
are
139,000
claimants
every
year
who
are
found
ineligible
because
they
left
their
last
job
for
the
wrong
reason.
over
a
136,000
of
these
claimants
are
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
eligibility
determination.
only
2,000
some
odd
are
found
ineligible
upon
an
employers
appeal.
that
means
that
the
initial
eligibility
determination,
there
are
500,000
and
some
odd
determinations,
400,000
pardon
me,
some
odd
determinations
made
each
year.
a
136,000
claimants
are
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
level
because
they
left
their
last
job
for
improper
reasons,
we
consider
that.
99%
of
the
cases
are
located
there.
we
consider
that
to
be
a
thorough
and
reliable
investigation.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
well,
the
statistics
seem
to
indicate
that
it's
done
as
a
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no,
not
at
all.
those
determinations
are
based
on
information
that's
been
supplied
by
the
employer.
and
the
decision
is
made
against
the
claimant.
and
in
those
cases
that
are
impelled
by
employers,
claimants
usually
prevail.
the
two
thirds
in
1969.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
the
fact
that
employers
lose
most
of
their
appeals
mr.
justice
white,
means
that
the
investigation
is
very
thorough.
the
investigation
decides
that
the
employee
is
properly
entitled
to
benefits.
upon
an
appeal,
the
investigator
is
upheld.
now
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
before
going
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
in
1969,
64%
of
employer
appeals
were
denied.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no
it's
not
but
--
that
means
that
those
5,900
claimants
in
1969
who
were
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
determination
and
then
were
found
eligible
again
upon
the
referee's
appeal,
received
no
benefits
during
the
time
they
were
entitled
to
receive
them.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct.
but
what
i
would
like
to
show
is
that
the
harm
that
would
be
caused
by
paying
employees
who
are
found
eligible
after
this
initial
investigation
pending
an
employer's
appeal
is
really
a
rather
minimal
amount
of
harm
even
for
a
large
state
like
california,
the
figures
are
very
low
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes
it
would.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
the
statute
requires
that
the
state
procedure
must
be
reasonably
calculated
to
pay
benefits
when
due,
to
ensure
the
payment
of
benefits
when
due.
and
we
believe
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question.
did
you
--
under
your
hypothetical?
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
whether
that
would
violate
the
statute
or
not,
would
depend
in
operation
upon
how
long
it
took
for
those
decisions
to
be
made.
that
is
if
it
took
months
and
months
for
decisions
of
that
kind
to
be
made,
then
under
our
theory
of
the
federal
unemployment
statute,
the
statute
would
be
violated.
however
if
california
hired
many
referees,
hearing
examiners
and
conducted
these
examinations
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
and
paid
benefits
during
the
period
of
eligibility
when
claimants
are
entitled
to
unemployment
insurance
when
they're
out
of
work
that
it
wouldn't
violate
the
statute.
but,
right
now,
over
a
130,000
claimants
are
found
ineligible
at
the
initial
level.
now,
for
all
of
those
claims
to
go
to
a
referee
would
require
the
state
to
make
an
enormous
expenditure
of
funds
for
referees.
now
that
is
totally
unnecessary
because
the
number
of
cases
that
we
are
asking
that
benefits
be
paid
pending
in
employers
appeal
is
a
very
small
number
of
cases
relatively
at
some
8,000
odd
cases,
only
less
than
3,000
of
those
claimants
would
be
found
not
to
have
been
entitled
to
benefits.
2/3
of
all
over
payments
are
recouped
by
the
state
of
california
under
their
own
statistics
so
that
we're
talking
about
a
figure
that's
rather
minimal
compared
to
the
nature
of
the
unemployment
fund.
to
hire
a
lot
more
referees
would
be
totally
cost
ineffective.
and
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
california
would
do
that.
it
has
not
done
that
since
the
case
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
two
third
under
the
64%.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
dollars,
two
thirds.
and
it's
right
--
and
it's
logical
that
they
would
because
unlike
the
goldberg
case
where
this
court
found
that
claimants
or
judgment
prove,
we're
dealing
with
working
people
here.
and
it's
very
likely
that
they'll
go
back
to
work
and
not
be
judgment
proof,
or
that
they'll
apply
for
unemployment
insurance
sometime
in
the
future,
they'll
be
out
of
work
again.
and
if
that
were
to
occur,
the
state
would
just
offset
the
over
payments
against
future
benefits.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
maximum
amount,
the
california
system
can
pay
is
26
weeks
but
the
average
claimant
in
california
gets
benefits
for
a
median
period
of
seven
weeks.
now
claimant
who's
found
eligible
and
whose
employer
appeals,
gets
no
benefits
until
some
10
weeks
after
he
first
walks
in
to
the
office.
some
7
weeks
after
the
appeal
is
filed.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
right,
but
at
the
time
when
he
was
never
--
when
he
was
no
--
when
he's
no
longer
really
entitled
to
receive
benefits,
clearly
at
that
time
the
congress
did
no
intend
them
to
be
getting
unemployment
compensation.
he
maybe
back
at
work
but
meanwhile
when
he
is
out
of
work,
he
has
no
money
at
all,
he
may
have
no
money
at
all.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
maximum
26
weeks.
now
this
case
we
believe
can
be
decided
on
federal
statutory
grounds
and
the
constitution
need
not
be
reached.
however
if
the
court
were
to
choose
to
reach
the
constitutional
question,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
california
procedure
violates
due
process
as
well
as
the
federal
statute.
well,
i
like
to
it
very
briefly
because
--
as
to
review
the
state
procedure
because
i
really
think
that
it's
critical
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
now
the
procedure
is
found
in
great
detail
on
pages
27
to
32
of
our
brief.
that
to
summarize
the
procedure
very
briefly,
an
unemployed
worker
who
believes
he
is
eligible
for
benefits,
applies
at
a
state
office.
he
fills
out
a
series
of
forms
including
a
form
revealing
why
he
left
his
last
job.
that
form
is
sent
to
his
employer
who
is
required
within
10
days
to
provide
any
information
he
has
concerning
the
claimants
eligibility.
he
is
required
to
do
that
by
section
1327
of
the
california
code
bylaw.
and
any
statement
made
by
an
employer
at
any
time
or
any
statement
made
by
an
employee
at
any
time
is
made
under
penalty
of
perjury.
so
it's
not
true
that
they're
not
made
under
oath.
in
addition,
the
employer
not
only
can
supply
information.
nor
he's
required
to
supply
information
in
writing
but
he
has
every
opportunity
to
communicate
with
the
examiner
who
is
charged
with
making
the
decision,
either
in
person
or
by
phone
with
or
without
witnesses.
after
the
form
is
returned,
the
examiner
interviews
the
claimant
an
interview
at
which
the
employer
is
free
to
appear.
if
the
claimant
presents
any
information
inconsistent
with
the
facts
given
by
the
employer
or
any
party,
the
examiner
must
telephone
the
employer
for
further
discussion.
this
is
assuming
the
employer
doesn't
come
in,
in
appear
with
witnesses
which
he
can
do.
and
if
the
employer
can't
be
reached,
the
examiner
postpones
the
decision
for
10
days.
that's
in
the
state
regulations.
then
once
the
examiner
has
gotten
all
the
information,
he
makes
a
decision.
he
reports
all
facts
and
he
gives
written
reasons
for
his
decision.
if
he
decides
the
claimant
is
eligible
for
benefits,
payments
commence
and
in
this
cases,
it's
my
understanding
that
each
of
the
two
claimants
receive
two
payments.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes
they
are.
and
it's
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
provide
weekly
payments
so
that
claimants
have
money
in
their
pocket,
each
week
so
they
can
buy
the
necessities
of
life
and
keep
purchasing
power
in
the
community.
this
decision
takes
three
to
four
and
a
half
weeks.
this
takes
quite
a
while.
it's
not
a
one
or
two
day
decision
as
is
true
for
example,
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
a
totally
different
kind
of
procedure
that's
not
before
us
in
this
case
where
a
claimant
comes
into
an
unemployment
office.
the
examiner
looks
at
its
papers
and
decides
if
he's
eligible
for
unemployment
insurance
on
its
face.
if
he
is,
the
employer
is
notified
that
a
claim
has
been
made.
and
that
the
employer
then
has
time
to
file
an
appeal.
if
the
employer
files
an
appeal,
the
decision
is
made
upon
an
appeal.
that's
the
first
time
the
employer
is
heard.
the
whole
process
works
much
more
quickly.
to
stay
there
pending
an
appeal
is
a
state
to
give
the
employer
chance
to
be
heard
not
after
there
has
been
an
investigation.
california's
own
regulations
on
page
116
of
the
appendix
state
very,
very
clear
language.
the
initial
determination
resolves
all
issues
involving
initial
eligibility.
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
eligibility
determination
was
very
thorough.
and
payments
commenced
at
the
initial
eligibility
investigation,
after
the
initial
eligibility
investigation,
the
worker
begins
receiving
benefits.
if
an
employer
then
files
an
appeal
at
any
time,
even
long
after
the
ten
days
that
he
has
to
file
an
appeal
has
expired,
benefits
are
cut
off
and
it
doesn't
matter
why
he
files
an
appeal.
he
can
dislike
the
employee.
any
reason
he
files
an
appeal
and
until
a
hearing
is
heard
which
is
--
over
50%
of
the
cases
is
more
than
10
weeks.
10
weeks
is
just
the
median.
no
benefits
are
paid
from
10
weeks
--
till
10
weeks
after
the
time
the
claimant
first
walks
into
the
office.
and
the
claimant
gets
no
funds.
the
employer
has
nothing
at
all
to
lose
in
filing
this
appeal.
his
unemployment,
he
has
everything
to
gain.
his
unemployment
taxes
are
based
according
to
his
record
as
an
employer.
that
is
that
he
pays
taxes
based
on
how
many
of
his
former
employees
get
benefits.
therefore,
he
does
have
an
interest
in
preventing
his
former
employees
from
receiving
benefits.
however,
he
loses
nothing,
absolutely
nothing,
the
individual
employer
if
payments
are
made
pending
appeal.
because
if
the
employer
wins
his
appeal,
at
any
level
including
judicial
review
in
the
state
of
california,
his
account
is
credited
as
if
his
employee
has
never
received
any
benefits.
therefore,
he
gains
nothing
by
the
suspension
but
he
has
every
reason
to
appeal
and
cut
off
his
employee's
funds
to
protect
his
record.
therefore
the
procedure
we
are
dealing
with
cuts
off
vitally
needed
benefits
on
the
basis
of
a
unilateral
fortuitous
act
by
one
with
an
adverse
private
interest.
and
it
does
so;
despite
carefully
made
and
fully
informed
decision
to
the
contrary
by
a
neutral
state
agency.
the
state
determines
them
eligible.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
is
true
but
that's
distinguishable
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
federal
statutory
question.
but
under
the
constitutional
question
that
a
tort
action
or
contract
action
against
an
insurance
company
is
totally
different
mr.
chief
justice
from
an
action
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
okay.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
this
is
not
an
insurance
claim
in
the
sense
of
private
insurance.
this
is
a
claim
against
the
state
for
benefits
which
the
state
is
paying
under
a
statute
designed
to
meet
a
particular
kind
of
problem.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes,
it
has
a
relationship.
the
difference
is
that
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
contract
action
in
a
court
of
law
that
benefits
are
not
necessarily
paid
at
a
particular
period
of
time.
lawsuits
are
by
nature
time
consuming,
payments
are
always
made
retroactively.
that
is
your
honor,
that
if
the
claimant
is
determined
eligible
and
the
insurance
–
the
court
says,
the
insurance
company
has
to
pay,
payments
are
always
retroactive.
that's
the
nature
of
the
game.
but
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
unemployment
insurance,
benefits
are
supposed
to
be
paid
in
a
weekly
manner.
time
is
very
critical.
the
congress
intended
these
benefits
to
be
made
at
a
particular
point
in
time
while
the
worker
is
out
of
work
before
he
finds
a
new
job.
that
is
not
true
with
respect
to
insurance
claims.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
is
a
very
strong
point
your
honor.
i
would
just
add
one
point
to
that,
that
a
corollary
to
that
was
filling
in
a
gap
for
those
claimants
who
are
not
eligible
to
receive
welfare
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
the
1935
congress
faced
with
a
desperate
economic
situation,
saw
two
distinct
groups
of
people
who
were
without
wages
and
without
liquid
assets.
they
saw
people
who
realty
couldn't
work,
old
people,
blind
people,
young
people,
disabled
people
and
they
also
saw
workers
who
couldn't
find
a
job
who
may
have
been
in
an
identical
economic
position
and
in
fact
this
court
held
and
explained
in
stewart
and
justifying
the
unemployment
compensation
law,
the
federal
act
that
the
congress
passed
the
act
because
workers
were
starving.
the
congress
did
not
want
to
lump
welfare
recipients
or
lump
non
workers
and
workers
into
one
program.
they
did
not
want
workers
to
go
on
a
dole
for
many
reasons.
and
therefore
what
the
congress
did
was
it
set
up
a
separate
program
for
unemployed
workers,
that
would
pay
them
benefits
at
a
particular
point
in
time,
they
would
work
for
these
benefits,
they
would
be
there.
hopefully
they
would
find
a
new
job
rather
quickly
and
then
they
would
be
off
benefits.
in
fact
they
have
to
be
off
benefits
rather
quickly.
and
since
the
congress
didn't
provide
welfare
for
these
people,
they
may
be
absolutely
penny
less
and
not
be
able
to
get
on
welfare.
and
therefore
there
is
a
gap
and
this
is
different
from
an
insurance
company
for
both
kind
of
situation
for
those
two
reasons.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
900,000
people
applied
the
initial
level.
there
are
roughly
500,000
to
600,000
determinations
made
initially
and
some
350,000
to
400,000
are
considered
eligible.
so
it
would
be
400,000
out
of
900,000.
now
the
reason
for
the
gap
between
determinations
and
between
people
who
come
in
to
the
office
is
that
many
people
who
come
in
to
the
office
aren't
eligible
because
they
haven't
worked
enough
weeks
or
made
enough
money.
so
that
they
are
--
they
are
just
eliminated
immediately,
then
in
other
cases,
employers
provide
no
information
and
it's
clear
that
a
claimant
has
a
valid
claim,
so
no
determination
is
made.
but
in
600,000
cases
i
believe
where
determinations
are
made,
some
400,000
are
determined
eligible,
some
200,000
are
determined
ineligible.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yeah.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
now
these
are
the
--
these
are
the
first
200,000
from
900,000
to
600,000?
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yeah.
most
of
them
because
they
haven't
earned
enough
money,
they
are
just
immediately
eliminated.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no.
those
statistics
aren't
in
the
record.
we
only
know
the
number
of
initial
determinations
in
1968,
960,000
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
but
under
the
constitution,
that's
a
very
--
that
would
be
a
very
close
case.
the
individual
builds
up
a
great
reliance
interest,
once
payments
do
begin
and
the
spectrum
of
interest
does
change.
he
gets
payments
for
one
or
for
two
weeks
and
habits
are
formed.
on
the
other
hand,
there
hasn't
been
a
thorough
investigation
as
there
has
been
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
there
hasn't
really
been
the
same
kind
of
determination
that
is
not
so
arbitrary
a
process.
i
would
imagine
that
the
fact
that
payments
are
made
alone
is
not
totally
--
it's
totally
determined.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
to
a
great
--
it
depends
on
that,
plus
the
fact
that
the
state
has
begun
making
the
payments
in
this
case.
the
state
has
chosen
to
make
the
payments,
it
begins
on
both.
it
hinges
on
both.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
because
both
sides
have
been
heard
and
that's
because
the
initial
determination
is
so
thorough.
yes,
the
initial
determination
is
critical
to
this
case.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that
is
correct.
the
employer
is
not
charged.
the
only
part
he
charged
in
that
case
is
the
state
which
must
pay,
which
must
recoup
benefits
and
does
recoup
2/3.
now,
employers
do
have
an
interest
in
the
sense
that
while
the
reserved
account
is
not
charged.
all
over
payments
come
out
of
a
general
state
fund
and
that
it's
conceivable
that
as
a
tax
payer
group,
their
general
taxes
could
go
up
but
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
for
everybody,
300,000
employees.
not
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
no,
the
employer
has
no
property
interest.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
the
only
property
interest
that
employer
has,
is
the
property
interest,
let's
say
of
a
property
tax
payer,
it's
school
expenditures
are
made,
or
the
property
interest
of
someone
who
uses
roads,
if
highway
expenditures
are
made.
the
employer
--
the
300,000
employers
are
interested
in
the
fund
in
the
sense
that
they
don't
want
it
to
plead
and
their
tax
could
conceivably
go
up.
but
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
possible
amount
of
over
payments
due
to
the
recoupment
rate
and
the
limited
nature
of
this
case
and
that
it's
the
employees
have
been
found
eligible.
and
it's
employers,
not
employees
who
are
appealing,
the
limited
nature
of
this
case
that
the
maximum
amount
of
over
payments
to
the
state
of
california
in
1969
would
have
been
some
$335,000.00.
the
reserve
fund
presently
has
1
billion
for
--
some
$304,000,000.00
and
since
this
case
is
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
employer
has
absolutely
no
doubt
a
constitutional
claim.
he
is
given
a
full
hearing
before
his
account
is
charged.
and
as
far
as
his
interest
in
the
property
that
is
his
interest
in
the
general
tax
fund,
his
ability
to
participate
in
the
initial
determination
certainly
needs
any
objection
he
might
have
as
a
tax
payer.
in
the
kanes
(ph)
case
back
in
the
mid
40's,
this
court
held
that
an
employer
in
a
similar
position
with
respect
to
workmen's
compensation
did
not
have
a
sufficient
due
process
interest
to
have
standing
to
bring
a
lawsuit
based
on
depletion
of
the
fund.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
oh,
yes
they
would
your
honor.
in
california,
the
employer
has
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct
except
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
they
are,
except
we've
got
to
analyze
why
california
is
withholding
benefits
pending
this
appeal
and
when
we
break
this
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
this
is
identical
to
goldberg
and
kelly
your
honor,
except
it
is
a
stronger
case.
it
is
squarely
controlled
by
goldberg
and
kelly.
in
this
case,
just
like
in
goldberg
and
kelly,
benefits,
this
rigorous
initial
eligibility
determination
has
begun,
benefits
have
been
commenced
and
benefits
have
then
been
cut
off.
and
the
difference
between
this
case
in
goldberg
and
kelly
makes
this
case
even
stronger.
the
individual
interest
in
this
case
is
much
like
the
individual
interest
in
goldberg.
the
benefit
serve
the
same
purpose
as
welfare
benefits.
the
median
income,
unemployment
compensation
recipients
is
some
$3,900.00
a
year.
and
for
family
of
four,
there
are
no
liquid
assets
with
the
median
income
of
that
kind.
the
situation
is
the
same
except
for
this
fact.
in
goldberg,
the
situation
involved
poor
people
and
in
this
case,
the
situation
involved
working
poor
people
who've
actually
been
at
work
and
who've
been
promised
these
benefits
in
the
event
that
they
would
be
suddenly
out
of
work.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
it
is
true
that
some
may
not
be
but
the
congress
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
well
in
california
right
now,
that's
true
that
there
is
a
high
aerospace
unemployment
rate
but
the
median
unemployment
--
the
median
income
figure
for
unemployment
recipients
that
i
gave
is
in
california
your
honor,
$3,900.00
for
a
family
of
four.
that's
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
it
would
reach
it,
because
the
reason
that
congress
--
the
reason
that
congress
setup
this
scheme
--
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
that's
correct,
for
the
each
individual
case.
however,
the
reason
the
1935
congress
setup
this
scheme
your
honor
was
precisely
because
it
believed
that
people
in
this
position
were
in
desperate
need
of
funds.
now
in
each
individual
case
it's
true
that
it's
not
critical.
this
case
your
honor
is
much
stronger
than
goldberg
and
kelly
for
two
additional
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
interest
of
the
state
are
far
less
as
i
have
mentioned
before.
recoupment
is
available
in
this
kind
of
a
case
and
secondly,
more
so
that
the
interest
of
the
employers
are
not
very
great.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
mainly
because
workers
on
unemployment
compensation
tend
to
be
out
of
work
again.
they
are
the
working
poor,
the
marginally
unemployed.
and
the
state
can
offset
payments
--
over
payments
against
future
benefits.
but
the
state's
figures
tell
us
that
at
64%.
mr.
stephen
p.
berzon
there
are
exceptions
in
every
case,
there
are
obviously
some
over
payments
that
aren't
recouped,
some
one-third
are
not
recouped.
