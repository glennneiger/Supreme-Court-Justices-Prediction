we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
507,
california
against
judith
java
and
others.
mr.
rubin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
you
should
direct
yourself
now
to
legal
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
telling
us
that
this
first
--
this
initial
interview
is
merely
an
informal
process
to
flush
out
the
obviously
clear
claims
which
are
usually
about
98%,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
real
processing
--
is
this
your
argument?
the
real
processing
begins
on
the
disputed
claims
which
are
2%
more
or
less.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
berzon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
that
figure
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
this
delay
is
limited
to
this
margin
of
2%
of
the
cases,
is
that,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
mean
by
recouping,
do
you
mean
in
the
cases
where
there
was
an
erroneous
payment,
a
payment
later
discovered
to
be
erroneous,
they
recoup
two
third?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
dollars
or
people,
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
often
happens
in
the
field
of
insurance,
does
it
not?
the
lawsuit
is
tried
on
an
ordinary
insurance
claim
or
life
insurance
policy
that
the
decision
goes
against
the
life
insurance
company
let
us
say
on
a
death
claim,
appeal
is
taken.
that
is
inconvenient
and
may
impose
hardships
but
it's
a
fact
of
life,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
to
be
a
contract
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
an
insurance
claim.
this
is
an
insurance
claim,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
i
said
it
was
using
the
term
insurance
claim
and
putting
it
in
quotation
marks,
it's
a
statutory
scheme
but
it
is
analogous
to
that
respect,
is
it
not
on
the
economics
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
your
strongest
point
really
in
terms
of
how
this
statute
should
be
viewed
and
construed.
the
purpose
was
to
fill
in
a
gap
and
income
and
anything
which
delays
that
payment
is
to
that
extent
negative
with
respect
to
the
statutory
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
gave
the
figure,
state
to
me
now
of
the
total
number
of
people
who
applied
for
benefits,
what
is
the
percentage
approximately
of
those
who
have
their
claim
approved
on
the
initial
interview?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
to
break
down
on
the
200,000,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
indicate
that
most
of
them
are
turned
down
simply
because
of
basic
ineligibility
that
is
--
they
haven't
worked?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
a
chart
that
shows
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
it's
not
in
the
record;
i
don't
want
in
any
length.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
present
a
much
more
difficult
question
than
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
statutory
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
these
funds
wouldn't
affect
california's
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
california,
the
state
of
california's
right
as
distinguished
from
the
private
employer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
are
quite
a
different
basis,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
differs
on
whether
they're
poor
in
vernacular
sense
or
whether
they're
not
quite
so
poor
wouldn't
really
reach
the
congressional
purpose
of
this
scheme
to
supply
some
income
during
the
unemployed
period,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
think
you
understood
my
question.
i
said
that
congress
wasn't
concerned
about
whether
they
were
poor
or
not
poor
but
only
whether
they
were
unemployed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
have
five
minutes
mr.
rubin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
assume
that
that's
the
central
issue,
mr.
berzon
doesn't
reach
that
statute
on
the
statutory
scheme
before
it's
a
basis
for
disposing
the
case,
of
course,
we're
going
to
dispose
it
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
employer
claims
he
was
discharged
for
cause
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
employee
claims
that
he
was
justified
in
his
conduct
as
here.
chief

wouldn't
it?
