justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
an
issue
for
as,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
must
decide
this
was
a
meritorious
discharge.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
point
mr.
rubin,
what
is
the
fact
of
the
employer's
right
to
appear
or
be
present
at
the
interviewer's
interview?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
now
the
obvious.
if
the
interviewer
decides
against
the
discharged
employee
and
i
take
it
the
claimant
then
has
a
right
to
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
payments
are
made
during
dependency
of
that
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
prevails
on
the
appeal,
does
he
get
a
lump
sum
payment
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
like,
perhaps
the
referee
decided
in
favor
of
the
claimant,
and
there
was
a
further
appeal,
the
state
terminated
the
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
what
about
goldberg's
payment,
what
about
the
constitutional
right
of
the
state
to
terminate
payments
after
the
referee
has
found
them
to
be
due
and
the
employer
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
are
suspended?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
the
referee
has
found
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
a
while
ago
asked
you
about
the
question
of
whether
when
the
referee
finds
him
or
when
the
interviewer
him
ineligible
but
the
referee
finds
him
eligible.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
employer
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
make
the
same
argument
here
that
that
suspension
is
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there
has
been
an
initial
determination
after
a
full
hearing
of
eligibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
part
of
your
case
was
that
the
decision
at
the
interview
stage
is
really
not
a
very
reliable
determination
because
of
the
nature
of
the
hearing
of
the
unlikelihood
that
there
would
be
evidence
and
that
the
employer
would
respond
and
things
like
that.
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
you
don't
have
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
would,
then
it
would
also
be
more
difficult
if
it
appeared
that
the
hearing
and
the
procedures
gone
through
before
the
interview
really
were
intended
to
be
a
hearing
and
certain
kind
of
a
reliable
determination
of
eligibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
be
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
employer
could
precipitate
a
full
hearing
before
the
interviewer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
unconstitutional
with
that
kind
of
a
program
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
statute
provided
no
payments
during
the
10
day
period
after
the
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
98%
involves
many
more
hundreds
of
thousand
maybe.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
the
same
question,
i
asked
your
opponent.
suppose
that
the
statute
said
no
payments
at
all
until
10
days
after
a
favorable
determination,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
asking
you
the
question
however.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
disagree
with
your
opponent,
when
you
say
this
is
a
thorough
investigation,
he
says
it's
an
interview
in
an
office
desk.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
how
thorough
is
that
investigation,
that
the
employer
lost
most
of
their
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
use
the
term
“most”
you
say,
what
does
it
amount
in
fact,
two-thirds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
majority
but
it
isn't
98%,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you‘re
using
big
figures
here
because
california
is
a
big
state.
if
this
were
in
nevada,
your
figures
would
be
much
smaller,
would
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
berzon
what
severe
view
of
the
district
of
columbia
situation,
if
after
the
initial
filing
an
interview,
the
district
started
to
pay
unemployment
compensation
and
that
terminated
it,
the
employer
appealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
statutory
but
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
just
hasn't
been
a
determination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
case
really
turns
on
an
assessment
of
the
content
subsequent
to
this
initial
determination
insofar
as
the
constitutional
issue
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
but
you
would
say
that
would
be
a
statutory
bar
in
this
event
that
california
did
not
begin
making
payments
as
soon
as
the
initial
interview
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
berzon,
you
said
earlier
i
think
that
the
employer's
experience
waiting
a
count
is
not
charged
even
if
this
could
happen
that
the
applicant
has
paid
benefits
pending
appeal,
the
employer
then
prevails
on
the
appeal.
the
employee
–
he
keeps
and
the
employer
is
not
charged,
experience
within
count
is
not
charged.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rate
for
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
enough
additional
charges
on
this
fund
as
a
result
of
this
action
it
might
get
the
rates
into
a
higher
level,
into
a
higher
bracket.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
does
the
employer
have
a
property
interest
to
state
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
that
you
suggested
the
overall
rate
for
everybody
may
go
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
employer
has
no
property
at
stake
here,
then
what's
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
claim
at
least
as
it
relates
to
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
the
constitutional
question
if
there
are
only
california
and
the
claimant
involved
because
there
is
no
property
interest
to
the
employer
at
stake,
then
why
isn't
this
in
the
context
to
goldberg
and
kelly?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
draw
the
conclusion
that
they
are
working
poor
people,
it
might
not
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
in
california
now
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
true
for
every
individual
employee--
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
an
issue

is
it?

he
must
decide
