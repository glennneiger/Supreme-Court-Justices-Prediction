how
about
being
down
to
a
meaning
of
the
two
words
“when
due?”
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
that
be
the
main
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
want
us
to
reverse
the
interviewer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
recollection
is
we
usually
dismiss
petitions
as
in
privately
granted,
when
we
discovered,
there's
nothing
but
a
little
tangle
of
the
facts.

the
lady
in
the
goldberg
versus
kelly
ended
up
in
a
bar?
i
don't
understand
this
saloon
aspect
of
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we're
not
a
jury
unless
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
statutory
question
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
all
has
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
the
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
federal
grant
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
started
to
argue
this
on
statutory
grounds,
as
i
understood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
supposing
california
said
all
of
these
claim
when
filed
noticeably
have
to
be
given
to
the
employer,
there
would
be
a
hearing
before
a
referee
and
no
compensation
of
any
kind
would
be
paid
and
after
it
is
determined,
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
figure
that
i'm
suggesting
would
be
a
full
goldberg,
ultra
goldberg-
kelly
type
hearing
prosecution.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
hypothetical
was
that
if
california
instead
of
processing
these
claims
in
this
way
in
its
doing,
it
said
we
will
process
the
claims
properly
but
will
do
it
on
a
full
addressed
hearing
before
referee
where
both
sides
can
be
heard.
