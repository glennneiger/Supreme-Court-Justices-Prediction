mr.
asher
rubin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
a
direct
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
judith
java
was
working
for
a
small
newspaper
in
the
town
of
pittsburg
california
in
august
of
1969.
during
this
employment,
she
stepped
out
one
day
at
about
noon
with
another
reporter,
went
to
a
bar
next
to
the
newspaper
office,
stayed
there
for
a
while
and
returned
to
the
office.
the
managing
editor
of
the
newspaper
observed
that
the
reporter
with
mrs.
java
appeared
to
be
drunk.
there
was
some
exchange,
the
reporter
was
fired
on
the
spot
and
mrs.
java
was
also
fired
on
the
spot.
later
when
mrs.
java
applied
for
unemployment
insurance
benefits,
she
claimed
that
when
she
was
in
the
bar,
she
had
some
tomato
juice
and
nothing
more.
the
referee
however
found
that
she
had
alcoholic
beverages,
she
smelled
of
alcohol,
she
was
glassy
eyed,
she
was
staggered
or
speech
was
slurred
and
the
referee
in
short
believed
the
employer
who
maintained
that
that
was
the
reason,
he
fired
her
for
misconduct.
after
her
employment
was
terminated,
mrs.
java
applied
for
unemployment
insurance
benefits.
she
went
to
the
unemployment
insurance
office,
she
had
an
interview.
she
was
given
some
forms
to
fill
out.
she
went
home,
came
back
some
time
later
after
the
interviewer
had
a
chance
to
verify
whether
she
had
sufficient
wages
in
her
base
period.
and
a
form
was
sent
out
to
the
employer
for
him
to
state
his
version
of
the
facts
and
why
she
was
terminated.
it
does
not
appear
that
this
form
was
ever
returned
by
the
employer
but
when
mrs.
java
returned
for
her
eligibility
interview,
the
interviewer
listened
to
her
and
apparently
contacted
the
employer
and
the
interviewer
believed
mrs.
java
who
was
sitting
right
there.
the
interviewer
believed
she'd
had
tomato
juice
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
otherwise
and
found
in
her
favor.
mr.
asher
rubin
no
your
honor.
but
the
reason
i
outlined
these
facts
is
because
i
feel
that
the
factual
circumstances
and
cases
like
these
maybe
dispositive.
when
we
get
to
the
point
later,
when
we
discuss
the
goldberg
versus
kelly
case,
i
believe
the
difference
in
factual
approach,
factual
circumstances
may
be
--
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
that
issue
goes
to
the
conformity
question
as
to
whether
the
--
mr.
asher
rubin
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
and
i
had
intended
to
leave
that
question
“when
due,”
in
a
context
of
the
statute
to
the
briefs.
i
believe
that
the
court
as
you
know
decided
this
case
on
two
grounds,
on
a
conformity
question,
whether
we're
paying
“when
due,”
and
secondly
on
a
due
process
question.
it
went
on
from
the
statutory
ground
then
decided
it
on
due
process.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
more
important
issue
here
today.
i
think
that
the
“when
due”
problem,
while
it
bears
on
due
process
is
essentially
a
statutory
problem
which
has
been
covered
in
the
briefs.
in
any
event
the
employer
--
mr.
asher
rubin
the
interviewer
did
decide
that
she
had
been
terminated
and
there
was
no
misconduct
on
her
part.
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
the
referee
reversed
the
interviewer
and
basically,
i'd
like
you
to
affirm
what
the
referee
found.
now,
after
the
interviewer
made
this
determination,
he
sent
a
notice
of
this
ruling
to
the
employer.
the
employer
immediately
appealed.
mr.
asher
rubin
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
give
that
impression.
i
believe
that
there
are
serious
and
constitutional
problems
here.
the
lower
court
found
that
this
case
was
indistinguishable
from
goldberg
versus
kelly.
and
i'm
about
to
get
to
what
i
consider
to
be
a
serious
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
asher
rubin
no,
i
mentioned
those
preliminary
facts
only
in
the
interest
of
completeness
your
honor.
i'm
not
trying
to
prejudice
those
cases
by
bringing
up
those
facts.
the
referee
later
accepted
the
version
of
the
employer,
there
was
disagreement.
but
this
wasn't
the
referee's
decision.
mr.
asher
rubin
well
you
honor,
the
lower
court
found
that
the
california
procedure
which
suspends
benefits
to
a
claimant
while
the
employer
appeals
was
out
of
conformity
with
a
provision
of
the
social
security
act.
the
social
security
act
says
that
the
secretary
of
labor
shall
certify
a
state
program
for
unemployment
insurance
only
if
it
has
methods
of
administration
which
are
reasonably
calculated
to
ensure
full
payments
when
due.
and
that's
how
we
get
to
the
“when
due”
problem.
the
lower
court
found
that
we
were
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
i
believe
that
that
would
be
right
your
honor
because
that
would
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
i
believe
we
have
to
proceed
to
the
constitutional
question
because
the
concept
of
whether
with
paying
“when
due”
does
involve
some
constitutional
problems
of
due
process.
if
you
find
that
the
--
on
the
statutory
ground,
if
you
reverse
on
the
statutory
ground,
then
it
may
simply
mean
that
the
secretary
of
labor
should
have
the
initial
power
to
examine
the
california
procedure
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
would
totally
dispose
the
case.
the
lower
court
did
go
on
to
talk
about
the
constitutional
problem
and
we
feel
that
it
is
presented
here.
we
should
discuss
it.
in
any
event
your
honor
the
question
of
whether
we
are
inconformity
with
that
with
this
act
and
whether
we
make
these
payments
“when
due”
is
covered
in
our
briefs.
so,
i
think
that
here,
we've
got
to
look
at
goldberg
versus
kelly
and
determine
whether
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
that
one
or
whether
this
one
is
different.
whether
goldberg
compels
the
decision
that
the
district
court
made
or
whether
it
doesn't.
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
that
this
course
is
--
this
case
is
very
different
from
goldberg
versus
kelly.
in
the
goldberg
situation
firstly,
you
have
only
two
parties.
you
have
the
state
and
you
have
the
welfare
claimant.
in
unemployment
insurance,
you
have
three
parties.
you
have
the
state,
you
have
the
claimant
and
you
have
the
employer
who
pays
for
this
program.
it's
his
contributions
exclusively
which
pay
the
unemployment
insurance
benefits.
we
maintain
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
your
honor,
the
federal
government
pays
the
cost
of
administering
the
program
but
it's
all
traceable
back
to
the
employer.
he
pays
90%
of
his
contributions
to
the
state
and
10%
go
to
the
federal
government.
out
of
that
10%,
the
federal
government
pays
the
cost
of
administration.
so
we
have
three
parties
here
that
we
have
to
worry
about.
we
have
the
state,
we
have
the
claimant
and
we
have
the
employer.
and
the
employer
interest
wasn't
present
in
goldberg.
now,
second
ground
of
distinction
is
that
in
the
goldberg
case,
this
court
was
concerned
about
termination
of
benefits
which
had
already
been
deemed
with
--
been
ruled
eligible.
that
is
that
the
claimant
had
already
been
ruled
eligible.
there
was
no
question
in
goldberg
about
the
initial
eligibility
of
the
claimant.
the
claimant
was
ruled
eligible;
the
claimant
was
receiving
welfare
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
came
the
abrupt
termination.
in
this
case
your
honors,
we
maintain
that
the
initial
question
of
eligibility
has
not
yet
been
made
final.
on
the
very
form
that
a
claimant
receives,
notifying
him
of
his
eligibility,
the
form
says,
this
determination
is
final
unless
an
appeal
is
filed.
it's
our
contention
your
honor
and
that
appeal
must
be
filed
within
10
days
of
the
initial
determination.
it's
our
contention
that
all
this
is
within
the
res
gestae
if
you
will,
of
the
initial
determination.
the
fact
that
the
interviewer
has
found
this
claim
ineligible
has
not
completed
the
initial
finding
of
eligibility
in
our
view.
and
this
is
we
think
the
critical
distinction.
the
employer
still
has
the
right
to
request
to
be
heard,
to
have
an
appeal,
to
have
a
hearing
to
present
his
views.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
technically
he
has
the
right.
practically,
he
almost
never
appears.
the
claimant
comes
back
in
all
candor
your
honors
in
the
manual
that
says
that
the
interviewer
may
contact
the
employer
and
should
contact
the
employer
while
the
claimant
is
sitting
there.
and
get
the
employer's
point
of
view
as
urgent.
of
course
if
the
employer
isn't
at
his
office,
the
interviewer
may
speak
to
a
foreman,
may
speak
to
someone
else.
then
the
interviewer
will
hang-up
and
will
tell
the
claimant
what
the
employer
says
and
a
determination
will
be
made
right
there.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
it
doesn't
pay
for
the
employer
to
try
to
come
down
to
this
interview.
98%
of
the
time,
there'll
be
no
problem.
he's
not
going
to
appeal.
the
statistics
which
we
have
presented
in
the
brief
show
that
98
cases
out
of
a
hundred,
the
employer
will
not
appeal.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
if
he
prevails
on
the
initial
appeal,
he
gets
payments
which
are
retroactive
and
irrespective
of
any
further
appeals
by
the
employer,
he
is
paid.
this
is
called
the
double
affirmation.
the
interviewers
found
them
eligible,
the
referee
has
found
them
eligible
under
section
1335
(b)
of
the
california
unemployment
insurance
code.
the
claimant
has
immediately
paid.
now,
your
honors
to
further
distinguish
goldberg
and
i
think
we're
coming
now
to
the
most
important
grounds
for
distinguishing
that
case.
in
welfare
by
hypothesis,
the
claimant
is
destitute,
has
no
assets.
mr.
justice
douglas
found
that
the
claimant
suffers
from
brutal
need,
is
in
a
situation
where
he
is
immediately
desperate
and
he
has
to
spend
his
day
just
finding
the
very
means
of
subsistence.
in
unemployment
insurance,
need
is
not
the
basis
for
entitlement.
indeed,
the
needier
the
claimant,
the
less
he
gets.
if
he
hasn't
made
out
$720.00
during
his
past
year,
he
gets
nothing
and
he
is
obviously
the
neediest.
if
he
makes
more
than
that,
he'll
get
the
minimum
payment.
the
person
who
makes
the
most
receives
the
most.
need
is
not
strictly
relevant.
indeed,
if
you
go
back
to
the
legislative
history,
unemployment
insurance
was
meant
to
be
paid
with
out
a
needs
test,
the
means
test.
just
a
few
weeks
ago,
the
new
york
three-judge
district
court
in
the
case
of
torres
versus
new
york,
decided
on
january
7,
rejected
the
lower
court's
decision
in
this
case,
java.
and
found
that
this
was
a
valid
ground
for
distinguishing
goldberg.
that
in
the
welfare
case,
need
is
the
engine
that
pulls
goldberg.
we
don't
believe
that
that
engine
should
be
harness
to
unemployment
insurance
to
pull
it
along
the
same
track.
and
we
recognize
that
in
actuality
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
once
that
referee
decides
once
more
in
favor
of
the
claimant,
then
as
i
stated
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
that
case
is
presented
when
a
claimant
is
initially
ruled
ineligible.
then
appeals
the
referee
finds
them
eligible
and
then
the
employer
appeals.
and
that
is
the
same
situation.
payments
are
suspended.
mr.
asher
rubin
they
are
suspended
because
the
--
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
the
referee
has
found
him
eligible
but
the
interviewer
found
them
ineligible.
mr.
asher
rubin
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
payments
are
suspended.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
i
would
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
this
is
the
reason
your
honor.
you
had
one
decision
by
the
interviewer
holding
the
claimant
ineligible.
you
had
one
decision
by
the
referee
holding
the
claimant
eligible.
now,
--
mr.
asher
rubin
yes
it
is
your
honor.
that
may
be
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
not
the
case
before
us
your
honor.
that
may
pose
more
difficult
problems.
i
would
--
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
right.
in
any
event,
i
believe
that
we
have
valid
grounds
for
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
goldberg
versus
kelly
situation.
now,
i
think
we
should
take
a
look,
focus
if
we
might
on
the
initial
interview
and
see
if
we
can
arrive
and
use
what
justice
cardozo
called
a
robust
common
sense.
the
interview
--
the
claimant
comes
in
for
an
interview.
there's
a
large
office,
there
are
number
of
desks,
the
claimant
sits
down
next
to
the
desk
of
an
interviewer.
the
interviewer
looks
over
the
forms,
there
are
other
people
waiting
to
be
interviewed.
it's
not
setup
to
be
an
adversarial
proceeding.
nobody
has
sworn.
there
is
no
testimony
taken
under
oath.
there
are
generally
no
witnesses.
you're
in
a
room
where
other
people
are
being
interviewed
in
the
same
fashion.
these
interviews
generally
take
about
40
to
45
minutes
including
all
the
paper
work.
and
the
claimant
is
right
there
to
talk
about
his
case.
it
is
true
that
the
interviewer
may
have
some
information
on
a
form
from
the
employer,
a
brief
statement
of
the
employer's
point
of
view.
it
is
also
true
that
the
interviewer
calls
the
employer
or
tries
to
reach
him
on
the
telephone
and
get
his
version.
and
then
he
hangs
up.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
then
he
hangs
up
and
he
comes
back
to
the
claimant
and
he
says,
the
employer
said
this,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
and
mrs.
java
said
“i
drank
tomato
juice,
this
is
my
version.”
and
then
the
interviewer
generally
makes
a
determination.
the
employer
is
not
there.
the
employer
gets
this
determination
and
he
files
his
appeal.
mr.
asher
rubin
technically
your
honor
he
could
be
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
asher
rubin
pardon
me?
mr.
asher
rubin
yes
is
the
answer
to
that.
but
your
honor
--
mr.
asher
rubin
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
because
there's
no
testimony
taken
under
oath
and
--
mr.
asher
rubin
no
your
honor.
it's
not
transcribed
whereas
the
hearing
before
the
referee
is
and
it
doesn't
have
any
of
the
trappings
--
mr.
asher
rubin
no
your
honor,
it
is
totally
informal
and
for
this
reason,
the
department
processes
thousands
and
thousands
of
claims
and
they
just
can't
have
the
hearings
where
you
will
have
adversaries
and
hear
it
from
one
and
from
the
other
and
have
it
transcribed
and
have
representatives
and
objections.
it
would
be
impossible.
in
1968
there
were
960,000
claims.
they
were
close
to
half
--
mr.
asher
rubin
in
california
alone.
they
were
as
close
to
half-a-million
eligibility
determinations
where
eligibility
was
involved.
in
1971,
the
benchmark
figures,
we
anticipate
1,230,000
claims.
this
is
going
to
cost
the
state
some
--
we
expect
to
pay
out
some
$980,000,000.00
in
1971.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
now
in
those
2%,
that's
a
different
ball
game.
the
2%
where
the
employer
appeals,
we
have
statistics
which
show
that
he
is
generally
successful,
close
to
50%
at
the

74
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
table
which
shows
out
of
the
appeals
filed,
certain
number
are
dismissed
or
withdrawn
and
generally
the
employer,
he
doesn't
file
a
frivolous
appeal.
in
these
2%
of
the
cases,
he
prevails
very
often.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
affidavits
submitted
in
connection
with
the
motion
of
southern
california
edison
company
to
intervene,
you'll
find
that
they've
done
very
well
in
these
appeals.
so
in
this
2%
of
the
cases,
it's
a
little
bit
different.
in
other
words,
we're
saying
that
this
initial
interview
procedure
--
let
me
make
one
more
point
while
that
occurs
to
me.
mrs.
java
did
after
the
interviewer,
found
her
eligible.
she
did
receive
one
payment
before
the
employer
appealed
or
shortly
thereafter.
she
did
receive
a
payment.
i
don't
think
that
this
should
be
misconstrued.
the
district
court
found
that
our
paying
claimants
“flies
in
the
face
of
actual
california
practice
that
our
claimant,
she
shouldn't
be
paid.”
she
was
--
one
payment
was
made
and
we
made
this
payment
because,
as
i
have
stated
earlier,
in
98%
of
the
cases,
there's
going
to
be
no
problem.
we
don't
feel
we
should
penalize
anybody.
we
don't
feel
that
they
should
have
to
wait
for
10
day
appeals
period
before
they
are
paid
because
the
chances
are
98%,
there
will
never
be
an
appeal.
so
let's
pay
him
right
away.
this
is
an
administrative
practice
and
is
very
generous
and
it
makes
a
good
sense.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
no
payments
are
made
while
the
appeals
time
is
running.
the
appeal's
time
runs
and
the
claimant
is
not
paid.
mr.
asher
rubin
i.e.
--
mr.
asher
rubin
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
alright.
your
honors,
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
asher
rubin
thank
you
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
just
come
back
if
i
might
to
what
we
consider
the
central
issue
in
the
case.
and
that
is
the
due
process
question
as
to
whether
it
violates
due
process
when
the
state
suspends
payments
while
the
employer
appeals.
mr.
asher
rubin
when
the
state
suspends
payments
to
the
claimants
after
the
initial
interview
once
the
employer
appeals.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
you
asked
that
question
of
mr.
berzon,
the
answer
is
that
the
employer
is
definitely
affected.
his
reserve
account
is
not
charged,
that's
true
but
the
balancing
account
to
which
he
also
contributes
is
affected
and
in
any
year
or
years,
this
is
another
unemployment
insurance
fund
when
the
reserve
accounts
are
depleted
to
a
certain
level,
then
the
balancing
account
maybe
affected
and
the
rate
will
go
up.
your
honor
this
is
--
mr.
asher
rubin
just
for
the
--
for
all
the
employers,
not
his
individual
account.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
our
honor
but
let
me
just
refer
you
to
a,
the
appendix
50
to
52,
and
the
appendix
75
to
76.
i
believe
on
those
pages,
it's
demonstrated
what
the
effect
is
on
the
employer
and
one
more
reference.
there
was
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
a
group
of
employers
and
i
believe
that
brief
together
with
the
affidavits
demonstrates
very
graphically
how
actual
employers
are
affected.
now,
we
feel
that
in
answer
to
the
central
issue
as
to
whether
due
process
is
violated,
we
feel
of
course
that
the
answer
is
no.
it
is
not
--
mr.
asher
rubin
yes
your
honor,
and
mr.
justice
harlan
opposed
that
early
in
my
argument
and
i've
been
considering
that.
the
question
as
to
whether
we
make
the
payments
when
due,
is
a
statutory
question
but
i
believe
that
it's
also
inextricably
bound
up
with
due
process
considerations.
and
i
believe
that
if
you
find
that
we
are
making
the
payments
when
due,
then
this
will
implicitly
validate
it
on
due
process
grounds.
now
perhaps,
i'm
wrong
but
we
fee
that
this
are
bound
up
together.
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
contending
precisely
the
opposite.
we
are
saying
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
your
honor
we
are
saying
that
when
a
person
wins
at
a
trial
court
let's
say
and
gets
a
judgment,
he's
not
entitled
to
be
paid
right
then
in
a
tort
judgment
let's
say.
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
appeal
and
that
the
payment
is
stayed
pending
the
appeal.
the
prevailing
party
does
not
get
payment
right
away.
mr.
asher
rubin
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
hope
that
makes
it
a
little
more
clear.
let
me
add
this
your
honors.
we
also
put
into
our
brief
a
statement
that
perhaps
a
lesser
delay,
a
lesser
number
of
weeks,
might
satisfy
due
process
considerations.
there
is
a
delay
of
some
six
or
seven
weeks
during
this
appeals
period.
right
now,
the
backlog
is
being
reduced
and
we
believe
that
we
can
have
that
delayed
down
to
between
three
and
four
weeks.
and
a
lesser
delay
we
think
would
help
a
claimant.
he
wouldn't
be
as
prejudiced
and
we
believe
this
would
fall
well
within
due
process
considerations.
there's
one
more
point
that
was
made
by
--
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
correct.
mr.
asher
rubin
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
exactly.
and
let
me
just
reiterate
that
this
is
a
viable
system.
98%
of
the
time,
this
system
works
with
extreme
expediency
and
dispatch.
and
it's
only
in
this
2%,
where
we
feel,
we
have
to
give
the
employer
a
chance
to
have
a
full
hearing
and
to
have
his
views
aired
and
get
his
decision.
we
believe
we
can
pull
a
delay
down
to
three
to
four
weeks,
many
claimants
as
you
well
know
have
severance
pay
and
other
assets
available.
we
believe
they
could
whither
this
delay.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
a
direct
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
judith
java
was
working
for
a
small
newspaper
in
the
town
of
pittsburg
california
in
august
of
1969.
during
this
employment,
she
stepped
out
one
day
at
about
noon
with
another
reporter,
went
to
a
bar
next
to
the
newspaper
office,
stayed
there
for
a
while
and
returned
to
the
office.
the
managing
editor
of
the
newspaper
observed
that
the
reporter
with
mrs.
java
appeared
to
be
drunk.
there
was
some
exchange,
the
reporter
was
fired
on
the
spot
and
mrs.
java
was
also
fired
on
the
spot.
later
when
mrs.
java
applied
for
unemployment
insurance
benefits,
she
claimed
that
when
she
was
in
the
bar,
she
had
some
tomato
juice
and
nothing
more.
the
referee
however
found
that
she
had
alcoholic
beverages,
she
smelled
of
alcohol,
she
was
glassy
eyed,
she
was
staggered
or
speech
was
slurred
and
the
referee
in
short
believed
the
employer
who
maintained
that
that
was
the
reason,
he
fired
her
for
misconduct.
after
her
employment
was
terminated,
mrs.
java
applied
for
unemployment
insurance
benefits.
she
went
to
the
unemployment
insurance
office,
she
had
an
interview.
she
was
given
some
forms
to
fill
out.
she
went
home,
came
back
some
time
later
after
the
interviewer
had
a
chance
to
verify
whether
she
had
sufficient
wages
in
her
base
period.
and
a
form
was
sent
out
to
the
employer
for
him
to
state
his
version
of
the
facts
and
why
she
was
terminated.
it
does
not
appear
that
this
form
was
ever
returned
by
the
employer
but
when
mrs.
java
returned
for
her
eligibility
interview,
the
interviewer
listened
to
her
and
apparently
contacted
the
employer
and
the
interviewer
believed
mrs.
java
who
was
sitting
right
there.
the
interviewer
believed
she'd
had
tomato
juice
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
otherwise
and
found
in
her
favor.
mr.
asher
rubin
no
your
honor.
but
the
reason
i
outlined
these
facts
is
because
i
feel
that
the
factual
circumstances
and
cases
like
these
maybe
dispositive.
when
we
get
to
the
point
later,
when
we
discuss
the
goldberg
versus
kelly
case,
i
believe
the
difference
in
factual
approach,
factual
circumstances
may
be
--
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
that
issue
goes
to
the
conformity
question
as
to
whether
the
--
mr.
asher
rubin
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
and
i
had
intended
to
leave
that
question
“when
due,”
in
a
context
of
the
statute
to
the
briefs.
i
believe
that
the
court
as
you
know
decided
this
case
on
two
grounds,
on
a
conformity
question,
whether
we're
paying
“when
due,”
and
secondly
on
a
due
process
question.
it
went
on
from
the
statutory
ground
then
decided
it
on
due
process.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
more
important
issue
here
today.
i
think
that
the
“when
due”
problem,
while
it
bears
on
due
process
is
essentially
a
statutory
problem
which
has
been
covered
in
the
briefs.
in
any
event
the
employer
--
mr.
asher
rubin
the
interviewer
did
decide
that
she
had
been
terminated
and
there
was
no
misconduct
on
her
part.
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
the
referee
reversed
the
interviewer
and
basically,
i'd
like
you
to
affirm
what
the
referee
found.
now,
after
the
interviewer
made
this
determination,
he
sent
a
notice
of
this
ruling
to
the
employer.
the
employer
immediately
appealed.
mr.
asher
rubin
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
give
that
impression.
i
believe
that
there
are
serious
and
constitutional
problems
here.
the
lower
court
found
that
this
case
was
indistinguishable
from
goldberg
versus
kelly.
and
i'm
about
to
get
to
what
i
consider
to
be
a
serious
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
asher
rubin
no,
i
mentioned
those
preliminary
facts
only
in
the
interest
of
completeness
your
honor.
i'm
not
trying
to
prejudice
those
cases
by
bringing
up
those
facts.
the
referee
later
accepted
the
version
of
the
employer,
there
was
disagreement.
but
this
wasn't
the
referee's
decision.
mr.
asher
rubin
well
you
honor,
the
lower
court
found
that
the
california
procedure
which
suspends
benefits
to
a
claimant
while
the
employer
appeals
was
out
of
conformity
with
a
provision
of
the
social
security
act.
the
social
security
act
says
that
the
secretary
of
labor
shall
certify
a
state
program
for
unemployment
insurance
only
if
it
has
methods
of
administration
which
are
reasonably
calculated
to
ensure
full
payments
when
due.
and
that's
how
we
get
to
the
“when
due”
problem.
the
lower
court
found
that
we
were
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
i
believe
that
that
would
be
right
your
honor
because
that
would
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
i
believe
we
have
to
proceed
to
the
constitutional
question
because
the
concept
of
whether
with
paying
“when
due”
does
involve
some
constitutional
problems
of
due
process.
if
you
find
that
the
--
on
the
statutory
ground,
if
you
reverse
on
the
statutory
ground,
then
it
may
simply
mean
that
the
secretary
of
labor
should
have
the
initial
power
to
examine
the
california
procedure
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
would
totally
dispose
the
case.
the
lower
court
did
go
on
to
talk
about
the
constitutional
problem
and
we
feel
that
it
is
presented
here.
we
should
discuss
it.
in
any
event
your
honor
the
question
of
whether
we
are
inconformity
with
that
with
this
act
and
whether
we
make
these
payments
“when
due”
is
covered
in
our
briefs.
so,
i
think
that
here,
we've
got
to
look
at
goldberg
versus
kelly
and
determine
whether
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
that
one
or
whether
this
one
is
different.
whether
goldberg
compels
the
decision
that
the
district
court
made
or
whether
it
doesn't.
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
that
this
course
is
--
this
case
is
very
different
from
goldberg
versus
kelly.
in
the
goldberg
situation
firstly,
you
have
only
two
parties.
you
have
the
state
and
you
have
the
welfare
claimant.
in
unemployment
insurance,
you
have
three
parties.
you
have
the
state,
you
have
the
claimant
and
you
have
the
employer
who
pays
for
this
program.
it's
his
contributions
exclusively
which
pay
the
unemployment
insurance
benefits.
we
maintain
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
your
honor,
the
federal
government
pays
the
cost
of
administering
the
program
but
it's
all
traceable
back
to
the
employer.
he
pays
90%
of
his
contributions
to
the
state
and
10%
go
to
the
federal
government.
out
of
that
10%,
the
federal
government
pays
the
cost
of
administration.
so
we
have
three
parties
here
that
we
have
to
worry
about.
we
have
the
state,
we
have
the
claimant
and
we
have
the
employer.
and
the
employer
interest
wasn't
present
in
goldberg.
now,
second
ground
of
distinction
is
that
in
the
goldberg
case,
this
court
was
concerned
about
termination
of
benefits
which
had
already
been
deemed
with
--
been
ruled
eligible.
that
is
that
the
claimant
had
already
been
ruled
eligible.
there
was
no
question
in
goldberg
about
the
initial
eligibility
of
the
claimant.
the
claimant
was
ruled
eligible;
the
claimant
was
receiving
welfare
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
came
the
abrupt
termination.
in
this
case
your
honors,
we
maintain
that
the
initial
question
of
eligibility
has
not
yet
been
made
final.
on
the
very
form
that
a
claimant
receives,
notifying
him
of
his
eligibility,
the
form
says,
this
determination
is
final
unless
an
appeal
is
filed.
it's
our
contention
your
honor
and
that
appeal
must
be
filed
within
10
days
of
the
initial
determination.
it's
our
contention
that
all
this
is
within
the
res
gestae
if
you
will,
of
the
initial
determination.
the
fact
that
the
interviewer
has
found
this
claim
ineligible
has
not
completed
the
initial
finding
of
eligibility
in
our
view.
and
this
is
we
think
the
critical
distinction.
the
employer
still
has
the
right
to
request
to
be
heard,
to
have
an
appeal,
to
have
a
hearing
to
present
his
views.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
technically
he
has
the
right.
practically,
he
almost
never
appears.
the
claimant
comes
back
in
all
candor
your
honors
in
the
manual
that
says
that
the
interviewer
may
contact
the
employer
and
should
contact
the
employer
while
the
claimant
is
sitting
there.
and
get
the
employer's
point
of
view
as
urgent.
of
course
if
the
employer
isn't
at
his
office,
the
interviewer
may
speak
to
a
foreman,
may
speak
to
someone
else.
then
the
interviewer
will
hang-up
and
will
tell
the
claimant
what
the
employer
says
and
a
determination
will
be
made
right
there.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
it
doesn't
pay
for
the
employer
to
try
to
come
down
to
this
interview.
98%
of
the
time,
there'll
be
no
problem.
he's
not
going
to
appeal.
the
statistics
which
we
have
presented
in
the
brief
show
that
98
cases
out
of
a
hundred,
the
employer
will
not
appeal.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
if
he
prevails
on
the
initial
appeal,
he
gets
payments
which
are
retroactive
and
irrespective
of
any
further
appeals
by
the
employer,
he
is
paid.
this
is
called
the
double
affirmation.
the
interviewers
found
them
eligible,
the
referee
has
found
them
eligible
under
section
1335
(b)
of
the
california
unemployment
insurance
code.
the
claimant
has
immediately
paid.
now,
your
honors
to
further
distinguish
goldberg
and
i
think
we're
coming
now
to
the
most
important
grounds
for
distinguishing
that
case.
in
welfare
by
hypothesis,
the
claimant
is
destitute,
has
no
assets.
mr.
justice
douglas
found
that
the
claimant
suffers
from
brutal
need,
is
in
a
situation
where
he
is
immediately
desperate
and
he
has
to
spend
his
day
just
finding
the
very
means
of
subsistence.
in
unemployment
insurance,
need
is
not
the
basis
for
entitlement.
indeed,
the
needier
the
claimant,
the
less
he
gets.
if
he
hasn't
made
out
$720.00
during
his
past
year,
he
gets
nothing
and
he
is
obviously
the
neediest.
if
he
makes
more
than
that,
he'll
get
the
minimum
payment.
the
person
who
makes
the
most
receives
the
most.
need
is
not
strictly
relevant.
indeed,
if
you
go
back
to
the
legislative
history,
unemployment
insurance
was
meant
to
be
paid
with
out
a
needs
test,
the
means
test.
just
a
few
weeks
ago,
the
new
york
three-judge
district
court
in
the
case
of
torres
versus
new
york,
decided
on
january
7,
rejected
the
lower
court's
decision
in
this
case,
java.
and
found
that
this
was
a
valid
ground
for
distinguishing
goldberg.
that
in
the
welfare
case,
need
is
the
engine
that
pulls
goldberg.
we
don't
believe
that
that
engine
should
be
harness
to
unemployment
insurance
to
pull
it
along
the
same
track.
and
we
recognize
that
in
actuality
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
once
that
referee
decides
once
more
in
favor
of
the
claimant,
then
as
i
stated
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
that
case
is
presented
when
a
claimant
is
initially
ruled
ineligible.
then
appeals
the
referee
finds
them
eligible
and
then
the
employer
appeals.
and
that
is
the
same
situation.
payments
are
suspended.
mr.
asher
rubin
they
are
suspended
because
the
--
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
the
referee
has
found
him
eligible
but
the
interviewer
found
them
ineligible.
mr.
asher
rubin
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
payments
are
suspended.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
i
would
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
this
is
the
reason
your
honor.
you
had
one
decision
by
the
interviewer
holding
the
claimant
ineligible.
you
had
one
decision
by
the
referee
holding
the
claimant
eligible.
now,
--
mr.
asher
rubin
yes
it
is
your
honor.
that
may
be
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
not
the
case
before
us
your
honor.
that
may
pose
more
difficult
problems.
i
would
--
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
right.
in
any
event,
i
believe
that
we
have
valid
grounds
for
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
goldberg
versus
kelly
situation.
now,
i
think
we
should
take
a
look,
focus
if
we
might
on
the
initial
interview
and
see
if
we
can
arrive
and
use
what
justice
cardozo
called
a
robust
common
sense.
the
interview
--
the
claimant
comes
in
for
an
interview.
there's
a
large
office,
there
are
number
of
desks,
the
claimant
sits
down
next
to
the
desk
of
an
interviewer.
the
interviewer
looks
over
the
forms,
there
are
other
people
waiting
to
be
interviewed.
it's
not
setup
to
be
an
adversarial
proceeding.
nobody
has
sworn.
there
is
no
testimony
taken
under
oath.
there
are
generally
no
witnesses.
you're
in
a
room
where
other
people
are
being
interviewed
in
the
same
fashion.
these
interviews
generally
take
about
40
to
45
minutes
including
all
the
paper
work.
and
the
claimant
is
right
there
to
talk
about
his
case.
it
is
true
that
the
interviewer
may
have
some
information
on
a
form
from
the
employer,
a
brief
statement
of
the
employer's
point
of
view.
it
is
also
true
that
the
interviewer
calls
the
employer
or
tries
to
reach
him
on
the
telephone
and
get
his
version.
and
then
he
hangs
up.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
then
he
hangs
up
and
he
comes
back
to
the
claimant
and
he
says,
the
employer
said
this,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
and
mrs.
java
said
“i
drank
tomato
juice,
this
is
my
version.”
and
then
the
interviewer
generally
makes
a
determination.
the
employer
is
not
there.
the
employer
gets
this
determination
and
he
files
his
appeal.
mr.
asher
rubin
technically
your
honor
he
could
be
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
asher
rubin
pardon
me?
mr.
asher
rubin
yes
is
the
answer
to
that.
but
your
honor
--
mr.
asher
rubin
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
because
there's
no
testimony
taken
under
oath
and
--
mr.
asher
rubin
no
your
honor.
it's
not
transcribed
whereas
the
hearing
before
the
referee
is
and
it
doesn't
have
any
of
the
trappings
--
mr.
asher
rubin
no
your
honor,
it
is
totally
informal
and
for
this
reason,
the
department
processes
thousands
and
thousands
of
claims
and
they
just
can't
have
the
hearings
where
you
will
have
adversaries
and
hear
it
from
one
and
from
the
other
and
have
it
transcribed
and
have
representatives
and
objections.
it
would
be
impossible.
in
1968
there
were
960,000
claims.
they
were
close
to
half
--
mr.
asher
rubin
in
california
alone.
they
were
as
close
to
half-a-million
eligibility
determinations
where
eligibility
was
involved.
in
1971,
the
benchmark
figures,
we
anticipate
1,230,000
claims.
this
is
going
to
cost
the
state
some
--
we
expect
to
pay
out
some
$980,000,000.00
in
1971.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
now
in
those
2%,
that's
a
different
ball
game.
the
2%
where
the
employer
appeals,
we
have
statistics
which
show
that
he
is
generally
successful,
close
to
50%
at
the
time.
page
74
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
table
which
shows
out
of
the
appeals
filed,
certain
number
are
dismissed
or
withdrawn
and
generally
the
employer,
he
doesn't
file
a
frivolous
appeal.
in
these
2%
of
the
cases,
he
prevails
very
often.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
affidavits
submitted
in
connection
with
the
motion
of
southern
california
edison
company
to
intervene,
you'll
find
that
they've
done
very
well
in
these
appeals.
so
in
this
2%
of
the
cases,
it's
a
little
bit
different.
in
other
words,
we're
saying
that
this
initial
interview
procedure
--
let
me
make
one
more
point
while
that
occurs
to
me.
mrs.
java
did
after
the
interviewer,
found
her
eligible.
she
did
receive
one
payment
before
the
employer
appealed
or
shortly
thereafter.
she
did
receive
a
payment.
i
don't
think
that
this
should
be
misconstrued.
the
district
court
found
that
our
paying
claimants
“flies
in
the
face
of
actual
california
practice
that
our
claimant,
she
shouldn't
be
paid.”
she
was
--
one
payment
was
made
and
we
made
this
payment
because,
as
i
have
stated
earlier,
in
98%
of
the
cases,
there's
going
to
be
no
problem.
we
don't
feel
we
should
penalize
anybody.
we
don't
feel
that
they
should
have
to
wait
for
10
day
appeals
period
before
they
are
paid
because
the
chances
are
98%,
there
will
never
be
an
appeal.
so
let's
pay
him
right
away.
this
is
an
administrative
practice
and
is
very
generous
and
it
makes
a
good
sense.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
no
payments
are
made
while
the
appeals
time
is
running.
the
appeal's
time
runs
and
the
claimant
is
not
paid.
mr.
asher
rubin
i.e.
--
mr.
asher
rubin
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
alright.
your
honors,
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
asher
rubin
thank
you
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
just
come
back
if
i
might
to
what
we
consider
the
central
issue
in
the
case.
and
that
is
the
due
process
question
as
to
whether
it
violates
due
process
when
the
state
suspends
payments
while
the
employer
appeals.
mr.
asher
rubin
when
the
state
suspends
payments
to
the
claimants
after
the
initial
interview
once
the
employer
appeals.
mr.
asher
rubin
your
honor,
you
asked
that
question
of
mr.
berzon,
the
answer
is
that
the
employer
is
definitely
affected.
his
reserve
account
is
not
charged,
that's
true
but
the
balancing
account
to
which
he
also
contributes
is
affected
and
in
any
year
or
years,
this
is
another
unemployment
insurance
fund
when
the
reserve
accounts
are
depleted
to
a
certain
level,
then
the
balancing
account
maybe
affected
and
the
rate
will
go
up.
your
honor
this
is
--
mr.
asher
rubin
just
for
the
--
for
all
the
employers,
not
his
individual
account.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
our
honor
but
let
me
just
refer
you
to
a,
the
appendix
50
to
52,
and
the
appendix
75
to
76.
i
believe
on
those
pages,
it's
demonstrated
what
the
effect
is
on
the
employer
and
one
more
reference.
there
was
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
a
group
of
employers
and
i
believe
that
brief
together
with
the
affidavits
demonstrates
very
graphically
how
actual
employers
are
affected.
now,
we
feel
that
in
answer
to
the
central
issue
as
to
whether
due
process
is
violated,
we
feel
of
course
that
the
answer
is
no.
it
is
not
--
mr.
asher
rubin
yes
your
honor,
and
mr.
justice
harlan
opposed
that
early
in
my
argument
and
i've
been
considering
that.
the
question
as
to
whether
we
make
the
payments
when
due,
is
a
statutory
question
but
i
believe
that
it's
also
inextricably
bound
up
with
due
process
considerations.
and
i
believe
that
if
you
find
that
we
are
making
the
payments
when
due,
then
this
will
implicitly
validate
it
on
due
process
grounds.
now
perhaps,
i'm
wrong
but
we
fee
that
this
are
bound
up
together.
mr.
asher
rubin
well
your
honor,
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
contending
precisely
the
opposite.
we
are
saying
--
mr.
asher
rubin
well,
your
honor
we
are
saying
that
when
a
person
wins
at
a
trial
court
let's
say
and
gets
a
judgment,
he's
not
entitled
to
be
paid
right
then
in
a
tort
judgment
let's
say.
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
appeal
and
that
the
payment
is
stayed
pending
the
appeal.
the
prevailing
party
does
not
get
payment
right
away.
mr.
asher
rubin
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
hope
that
makes
it
a
little
more
clear.
let
me
add
this
your
honors.
we
also
put
into
our
brief
a
statement
that
perhaps
a
lesser
delay,
a
lesser
number
of
weeks,
might
satisfy
due
process
considerations.
there
is
a
delay
of
some
six
or
seven
weeks
during
this
appeals
period.
right
now,
the
backlog
is
being
reduced
and
we
believe
that
we
can
have
that
delayed
down
to
between
three
and
four
weeks.
and
a
lesser
delay
we
think
would
help
a
claimant.
he
wouldn't
be
as
prejudiced
and
we
believe
this
would
fall
well
within
due
process
considerations.
there's
one
more
point
that
was
made
by
--
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
correct.
mr.
asher
rubin
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
asher
rubin
that's
exactly.
and
let
me
just
reiterate
that
this
is
a
viable
system.
98%
of
the
time,
this
system
works
with
extreme
expediency
and
dispatch.
and
it's
only
in
this
2%,
where
we
feel,
we
have
to
give
the
employer
a
chance
to
have
a
full
hearing
and
to
have
his
views
aired
and
get
his
decision.
we
believe
we
can
pull
a
delay
down
to
three
to
four
weeks,
many
claimants
as
you
well
know
have
severance
pay
and
other
assets
available.
we
believe
they
could
whither
this
delay.
thank
you
your
honor.
