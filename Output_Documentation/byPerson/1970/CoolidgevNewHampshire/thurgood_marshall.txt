but
why
have
a
search
warrant
at
all
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
--
do
you
tell
us
that
the
attorney
general
at
that
stage
was
a
neutral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fact
being
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
like
to
just
warn
you
mr.
kalinski,
when
you
get
through,
i’m
still
going
to
ask
you
to
explain
that
after
knowing
all
of
that,
how
did
he
become
neutral
and
the
longer
you
give
me
facts,
the
more
difficult,
i
personally
am
going
to
add
in
finding
that
he’s
neutral
since
he
knows
all
of
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
he
issued
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
issued
the
arrest
warrant,
did
he
know
more
facts
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
conference
room,
what
was
the
purpose
of
that,
to
present
evidence
or
a
search
warrant
or
to
sum
up
just
how
good
a
case
you
got
against
this
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
he
participate
in
whether
or
not
we’ve
got
a
good
case
against
this
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that’s
what
they
were
discussing
weren’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
attorney
general
was
there
doing
the
discussion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
after
the
discussion,
was
he
neutral
at
the
beginning
of
the
discussion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn’t
he
the
prosecutor
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
did
he
--
well,
do
you
agree
with
me
that
the
prosecutor
is
not
neutral?
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
he’d
also
been
a
judge
under
new
hampshire
law,
could
he
have
tried
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
could
he
have
been
a
judge
and
found
him
guilty
if
new
hampshire
law
was
that
way?
could
he
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
investigated,
prosecuted,
issued
the
warrant
and
convict
it
just
because
massachusetts
says
that’s
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
didn’t
say
the
attorney
general
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
one
final
question,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
says
that
as
of
this
moment,
i
3817,
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
seize,
plea
and
prosecutor
and
become
magistrate?
that’s
not
in
the
record
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
just
trying
to
find
out
why
he
changed
his
head.
justice
thurgood

changed
them.
