mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
first
degree
murder
case
here
in
forma
pauperis
and
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire.
two
constitutional
questions
are
presented,
the
first
is
whether
a
search
warrant
issued
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
upon
the
un-sworn
reports,
oral
reports
of
his
subordinates,
while
he
is
in
active
charge
of
a
criminal
investigation
and
when
he
will
actually
himself
lead
the
prosecution,
is
a
valid
search
warrant
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
and
of
course
we
submit
that
it
plainly
is
not.
the
second
question
which
relates
to
an
entirely
different
incident
so
that
we
may
win
on
either
ground.
the
second
question
is
whether
a
wife’s
acquiescence
in
the
taking
of
her
husband’s
personal
belongings
will
validate
what
otherwise
is
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
as
this
being
a
state
case.
these
two
questions
are
better
understood
if
i
outline
the
salient
points
concerning
the
case.
on
january
13,
1964,
a
young
girl
pamela
mason
left
her
house
in
manchester,
new
hampshire
on
a
baby
sitting
assignment.
she
disappeared,
eight
days
later,
her
body
was
found
by
the
side
of
the
principal
interstate
highway
leading
south.
the
state’s
theory
later
became
that
she
had
been
shot
by
a
22-caliber
mossberg
rifle,
also,
her
throat
had
been
cut
with
a
knife
and
that
the
body
had
been
dumped
there
about
9
o’clock
or
9:30,
perhaps
that
same
evening
when
it
was
covered
by
an
unusually
heavy
snow
storm
and
then
after
a
rainstorm
eight
days
later
became
visible.
this
was
a
disappearance
and
crime
which
excited
enormous
attention
in
manchester
and
indeed
through
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
at
the
time,
the
police
broadcast
appeals
for
people
to
come
forward
with
the
names
of
anyone
who
were
out
of
the
house
that
evening
and
eventually
one
of
petitioner’s
neighbors
reported
to
the
police
that
he
had
been
out
of
his
house
that
night
and
they
went
to
the
house
on
january
28,
police,
two
of
them
and
questioned
him
about
his
whereabouts.
he
gave
an
explanation
which
unfortunately
for
him
later
turned
out
to
be
false.
he
also
showed
the
police
some
guns
that
he
had
in
the
house
at
that
time,
spoke
to
them
very
freely
and
they
asked
him
if
he
would
be
willing
to
go
up
to
concorde
to
the
headquarters
of
the
state
police
to
take
a
lie
detector
test,
he
said
that
he
would
and
since
he
was
working
as
a
bakery
truck
driver,
asked
that
it
be
on
his
day
off
sunday.
then
on
sunday,
february
2,
they
did
indeed
go
up
to
the
state
police
headquarters
and
he
took
the
lie
detector
test
which
produced
no
affirmative
indication
if
his
guilt,
but
at
that
time
he
did
admit
that
he
had
embezzled
a
small
sum
of
money
from
his
employer.
when
they
went
back
to
manchester,
he
was
questioned
late
into
the
night
by
the
police.
he
was
not
actually
arrested
in
a
formal
sense
till
after
midnight
but
the
trial
judge
found
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
leave
at
any
time
after
they
had
returned
from
manchester
--
from
concorde.
the
first
search
and
seizure
of
which
we
complain
occurred
on
that
day
february
2,
while
petitioner
was
in
custody
at
the
manchester
police
station,
two
different
officers
who
had
never
been
to
his
house
before
went
to
his
house
and
with
the
acquiescence
of
his
wife
mrs.
coolidge
obtained
his
guns
and
clothing
and
took
them
away.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
were
the
same
guns
the
different
police
had
seen
before
and
there’s
no
indication
that
these
two
men
had
any
information
about
what
had
happened
before.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
she
did
and
i
thought
it
would
be
convenient
mr.
chief
justice
if
i’m
going
to
argue
the
question
about
the
attorney
general’s
warrant
first
and
i
thought
it
might
be
convenient
if
i
refrain
from
stating
the
facts
about
this
search
which
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
took
place
chronologically
first
until
i
come
to
what
will
be
the
second
branch
of
my
argument
and
then
i
will
address
myself
to
the
specific
questions
that
you
mentioned.
the
second
--
so
i
say
petitioner
was
held
at
the
police
station,
he
was
held
overnight
on
this
larceny
charge
and
then
he
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance.
so
that
he
was
not
imprisoned
during
the
ensuing
weeks.
the
second
search
and
seizure
occurred
some
weeks
later
on
february
19,
you
see
almost
three
weeks
after
the
first.
attorney
general
menard
who
had
taken
active
charge
of
the
investigation
in
prosecution,
called
a
conference
in
his
office
in
concorde
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
the
evidence
that
had
best
far
have
been
developed.
there
were
president,
representatives
of
the
manchester
police
and
the
state
police
and
two
assistant
attorney
general.
those
officers
presented
to
him
what
their
investigation
had
revealed
presenting
it,
the
trial
judge
explicitly
found
to
him
in
his
capacity
as
the
chief
prosecuting
officer
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
there
was
no
record
made
of
that
and
none
of
what
was
said
was
under
oath.
police
chief
mcgranery
did
testify
during
the
trial
on
voir
dier
concerning
what
took
place
but
there
was
no
record
and
as
i
say
it
was
not
under
oath.
this
was
just
i
think
quite
genuinely,
subordinates
reviewing
with
the
chief
investigator
and
later
prosecutor
what
they’d
been
able
to
develop.
then
at
the
end
of
that
conference
after
about
two
hours,
we
know
from
chief
mcgranery’s
description,
he
asked
for
an
arrest
warrant
and
four
search
warrants
against
the
petitioner
and
the
attorney
general
having
a
commission
as
justice
and
peace,
took
chief
mcgranery’s
oath
to
the
complaint
and
then
he
himself
issued
the
five
warrants.
one
of
which
we’re
concerned
with
here,
the
warrant
for
an
old
pontiac
automobile.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
--
i
know
that
he
--
that
mr.
menard
did,
i
suspect
that
others
did,
new
hampshire
have
an
extraordinary
practice
at
this
time,
chief
mcgranery
testified
that
they
never
went
out
of
the
police
department
to
get
a
search
warrant,
they
just
had
the
inspectors
and
captains,
old
commissioned
justices
of
the
peace,
he
testified
this.
and
that
is
not,
i
don’t
want
to
overstate
it,
that
is
not
the
practice
today
because
the
statute
has
been
changed
but
it
was
a
settled
practice
at
this
time
so
this
wasn’t
denied,
it
happenstance
apparently.
'that
evening,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference
here,
there
was
a
challenge
to
mr.
coolidge’s
arrest.
it’s
very
clear
in
the
headings
to
petitioner’s
brief
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
that
they
challenged
the
arrest
warrants
on
the
same
grounds
as
the
search
warrants.
it’s
one
of
the
black
letter
head
things
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
does
not
make
any
difference
to
our
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes,
i
assume
that
and
hope
that
i
may.
i
--
that
evening,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
in
his
house
pursuant
to
the
arrest
warrant,
or
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
later,
the
pontiac
car
was
towed
to
the
police
station.
it
was
searched
the
next
day
and
then
again
a
year
later.
the
search
is
important
without
going
into
the
details
because
in
the
course
of
vacuuming
the
car,
the
police
obtained
tiny
particles
and
later
examined
under
a
microscope
which
an
experts
sought
to
associate
with
particles
that
they
said
were
substantially
similar
taken
from
the
clothes
of
this
unfortunate
girl.
and
the
expert
testimony
was
that
there
was
some
extraordinarily
load,
a
high
degree
of
probability
that
the
body
must
have
been
in
the
car.
this
i
would
say,
this
evidence
of
which
the
court
first
refused
to
suppress
on
our
motion
before
trial
and
which
was
admitted
over
our
objection
pressed
all
the
way
through
the
trial
an
on
appeal,
was
very
essential
to
the
prosecutions
case.
this
is
not
conceivably
a
case
where
you
could
say
that
this
was
harmless
error
within
this
court’s
rule.
indeed,
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
noted
three
or
four
or
five
times
the
very
dubious
character
of
the
evidence
against
the
--
of
the
proof
against
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
on
265,
it
says
the
proof
was
not
wholly
free
from
weakness,
then
it
speaks
of
how
the
limitations
of
time
cast
out
on
the
state’s
theory
and
how
further
doubts
were
cast
by
certain
other
evidence
and
how
the
ballistics
evidence
blow
up
to
put
it
colloquially
in
the
state’s
face
during
the
trial.
so
that
this,
i’m
simply
emphasizing
the
importance
of
this
question.
now,
our
first
contention
here
is
basically
a
very
simple
one
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
was
simply
negating
any
possibility
that
the
rule,
it’s
the
case
decided
the
same
day
as
cooper
in
california,
i
can’t
think
of
the
name
of
it
now,
could
be
applicable
here.
that
is
that
it
was
harmless
error.
i
think
that
isn’t
true
and
i
do
emphasize
that
this
was
a
very
close
case
on
the
trial
so
that
this
evidence,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
was
important
capital,
that’s
right,
was
important
to
the
prosecution.
now
our
first
and
primarily
contention
as
i
say,
is
that
the
admission
of
evidence
obtained
under
the
search
warrant
violated
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights
because
the
warrant
which
is
issued
by
the
chief
prosecutor
instead
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
and
i
need
hardly
remind
the
court
that
it
has
said
over
and
over
again
since
johnson
against
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
jackson’s
opinion
that
one
of
the
indispensable
conditions
to
a
valid
warrant
is
that
the
inferences
from
the
facts
which
lead
to
the
complaint
be
drawn
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
instead
of
being
judged
by
the
officer
engaged
in
the
often
competitive
enterprise
of
ferreting
out
crime.
the
closest
case
unquestionably
is
mancusi
v.
deforte
where
the
court
dealt
with
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
that
had
been
issued
by
the
district
attorney
in
new
york
and
justice
harlan
in
writing
the
opinion
considered
whether
this
would
be
–
whether
the
evidence
would
have
been
admissible
if
the
subpoena
could
be
treated
as
a
search
warrant.
and
he
said
no
and
there
was
no
dissent
on
that
point
in
the
court
because
the
district
attorney
was
not
a
detached
and
neutral
officer.
now,
the
state
replies
that
attorney
general
menard
before
he
signed
the
warrants
took
off
his
black
prosecutorial
hat
and
put
on
his
white
justice
of
the
peace
hat.
we
think
that
that
purely
formal
step
did
not,
indeed
could
not
confer
on
him
a
neutrality.
a
disinterestedness
under
these
circumstances.
he
was
i
say
inactive
charge
of
this
prosecution.
he
was
the
man
that
the
press
had
been
badgering
for
days.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
he
was
inactive
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
i
would
emphasize
too
he
was
inactive
charge
and
he
l
for
the
prosecution
at
the
trial.
he
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
he
had
promised
vigorous,
ruthless
investigation.
just
four
days
before
he
signed
the
warrants
and
the
banner
headline
was
menard
has
suspect.
he
was
thoroughly
wrapped
up
in
the
investigation
and
its
success.
now,
i
don’t
direct
this
at
him
personally,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
him
and
have
a
high
regard
for
him
but
it’s
beyond
any
man's
human
capability
to
be
neutral
and
detached
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
don’t
argue
that.
it
has
been
argued
in
the
courts
below,
i’m
prepared
to
assume
that
there
was
probable
cause
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
raise
a
question
and
do
raise
a
question
whether
where
the
police
rely
on
the
warrant
and
they
do
not
assert
any
exigent
circumstances,
where
that
matter
really
is
not
looked
into
in
the
court
below.
i
would
suggest
that
under
giordenello
against
the
united
states,
the
shift
in
claim
is
not
available
here
but
i
would
--
i’d
go
on
justice
white
and
i
was
about
to
deal
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
the
three
other
grounds
that
the
state
invokes
here,
apart
from
the
warrant
because
i
do
have
to
speak
to.
and
one
is
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
united
states
against
carol
and
ending
with
the
courts
opinion
which
you’ve
delivered
in
chambers
and
maroney.
i
say
that
those
cases
are
entirely
distinguishable.
it’s
one
thing
for
the
police
to
stop
a
car
in
motion
on
the
highway
when
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
driver
is
either
carrying
contraband
or
fleeing
the
scene
of
a
crime.
it’s
quite
another
i
submit
to
go
to
a
man’s
home
and
to
search
about
in
an
automobile
parked
in
his
driveway
which
is
not
in
motion
and
its
not
about
to
be
in
motion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
this
case,
of
course
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
manchester
police.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
what
i
meant
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
about
to
be
put
in
motion,
there
was
no
indication
of
an
exigent
circumstance.
i
think
the
burden
is
on
the
police,
if
they
are
seeking
to
shove
and
that
there
are
some
reason
for
not
getting
a
warrant
which
they
can
hardly
do
here
where
they’d
gotten
the
warrant
that
very
day
and
taking
the
time
to
do
but
i
think
the
burden
generally
speaking
is
on
the
police
to
show
some
exigency.
now,
if
you
got
the
car
going
carrying
contraband
with
somebody
who’s
engaged
in
that,
you
have
some
reason
to
think
you
should
act
quick
but
i
see
no
reason
at
all
candor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
no
way
if
you
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
yes
of
course
that
was
what
divided
the
court
in
chambers
and
maroney,
but
at
least
there,
one
was
able
to
say,
well,
what’s
the
difference
between
searching
it
then
and
there
and
taking
it
down
to
the
police
station
and
searching
it
later
at
the
police
station.
i’m
not
making
anything
turn
on
the
fact
that
this
car
was
not
searched
until
the
next
day
or
until
a
year
later.
i
make
nothing
about.
i
disclaim
any
emphasis
on
that.
i
make
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
this
was
not
incident
to
the
arrest
because
the
petitioner
had
been
arrested
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
earlier
and
was
in
custody
at
that
time
and
i
make
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
the
car
was
not
stopped
under
circumstances
indicating
that
if
you
took
time
to
get
a
warrant,
you
might
miss
your
chance
to
stop
it
and
search
it.
indeed,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
car
was
described
as
the
container
of
the
things
that
were
being
sought.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
was
not
described
as
the
object
to
the
search.
indeed,
i
think
that
it
indicates
the
police
weren’t
really
interested
in
the
car
except
as
a
container
or
vehicle.
and
i
would
suggest
perhaps
i
can
put
the
point
by
oversimplifying
it
most
dramatically.
i
don’t
see
the
difference
between
searching
for
this
object
in
that
car
parked
in
a
man’s
garage
and
saying
that
you
don’t
have
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
for
it
if
this
is
on
the
bench
in
the
garage
or
if
it’s
in
an
office
in
the
house
or
in
the
bedroom.
it’s
really
just
as
movable.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
carrol
involved
stopping
the
car
on
the
highway
when
it
was
in
motion
and
the
contraband
was
being
carried.
and
the
language
in
carroll
is
very
explicit
on
that
point.
the
chief
justice
taft
doesn’t
it
spoke
of
a
right
of
free
passage
except
under
these
circumstances,
he
was
talking
about
people
that
are
moving,
things
that
are
fleeting
as
your
honor
put
it
in
chambers
and
maroney.
not
about
something
which
is
simply
a
container
at
the
man’s
house.
i
press
again,
if
what
one
is
thinking
about
it
is
a
small
chapel,
what
difference
is
there
today
between
saying
it
may
disappear
because
its
in
the
glove
compartment
in
a
car
that
is
parked
by
house
and
saying
it
may
disappear
because
its
out
of
bench
in
the
barn
or
is
in
an
office
in
the
building,
where
it
could
just
as
readily
be
put
in
the
car
and
carried
away.
i
submit
that
once
your
honors
stepped
over
this
line,
the
whole
trend
of
law
of
searches
and
seizure
which
encourages
better
police
work
and
puts
a
disinterested
magistrate
between
the
police
and
the
citizen
would
virtually
begun
i
submit.
i’ve
always
skeptical
students
who
parade
horribles
to
me
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
would
be
true
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
said
i
wasn’t,
but
i
didn’t
think
i
had
to
dispute
that
part
and
i
would
point
out
mr.
chief
justice
that
from
silverthorne
lumber
through
(inaudible),
this
court
had
consistently
held
that
the
fact
that
you
might
get
a
search
warrant
the
right
way
will
not
excuse
a
search
and
seizure
made
without
a
warrant
or
upon
an
invalid
one.
and
of
course
the
reason
is
clear,
if
the
police
could
justify
by
saying
well,
we
could
have
gotten
the
warrant
the
right
way,
we
could
have
gotten
the
neutral
man
to
sign
this.
in
the
first
place
there’s
always
a
little
bit
of
uncertainty
or
speculation
after
the
event.
but
in
the
second
place,
the
whole
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
undermined
because
they
would
always
come
to
court
later
and
defend
it
if
they
could.
this
was
covered
again
in
mancusi
and
deforte
and
the
opinion
quotes
similar
language
by
justice
holmes
of
the
silverthorne
lumber
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
i
argued
it?
yes,
but
i
don’t
stress
the
point,
i
don’t
want
to
conceal
the
facts
that
i
don’t
stress
it,
we
don’t
volunteer
that
there
was
a
probable
cause.
i
don’t
know
where
it
was
it
not,
but
i’m
not
making
any
claim
about
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
now,
i
think
i
should
go
on
to
the
other
and
more
difficult
theoretically
more
difficult
issue
in
the
case
which
is
the
effect
of
the
wife’s
consent
to
the
taking
of
the
22-caliber
mossberg
rifle
and
some
clothing
from
petitioner’s
closet,
bedroom
closet.
very
briefly,
the
facts
were
these.
on
that
evening
on
february
2
while
he
was
being
detained
at
the
police
station,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
she
was.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
entirely
free
and
open
in
responding
showing
anything
and
responding
to
anything
they
ask.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
she
was
present.
i
would
simply
say
that
the
circumstances
had
changed
so
much
by
february
2
when
he
was
being
held
in
custody
that
neither
she
nor
the
police
would
be
entitled
to
infer
from
his
conduct
then
that
he
was
authorizing
her
to
make
up
his
mind
for
him
later.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
no
evidence
of
his
saying
anything
to
her
which
would
cause
her
to
draw
a
different
inference
so
i
suggest
there
was
a
marked
difference
in
the
circumstances.
and
his
willingness
to
do,
to
make
that
decision
at
that
time
does
not
seem
to
me
they
properly
authorized
her
to
infer
that
she
could
make
the
decisions.
may
i
speak
very
briefly
of
the
main
points
with
respect
to
the
wife’s
consent?
first,
i
would
emphasize
that
there
was
a
seizure
and
i
think
in
the
constitutional
sense
a
search
here.
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
said
no.
i
can
illustrate
the
point
best
by
putting
another
homely
little
example.
suppose
that
an
fbi
agent
were
to
come
to
my
office
in
lindale
hall
and
say
there
was
a
valuable
manuscript
missing
from
the
library
of
this
court
and
to
describe
it
and
say
they
had
some
reason
to
think
it
was
encumbered.
in
some
further
that
i
say,
oh
that’s
curious,
i’ve
seen
something
looks
very
like
that
in
my
colleague
professor
dawson’s
office
dawn
the
hall.
he
keeps
it
in
among
the
books
in
his
library.
come
on
i’ll
show
it
to
you,
each
of
us
has
a
key
that
fits
every
other
office
and
we
occasionally
go
in
to
borrow
books.
i
take
it
that
if
i’d
led
the
fbi
into
his
office
and
showed
them
that
document
at
their
request
that
everyone
would
say
there
was
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
quite
true,
fond
of
him,
but
that
goes
to
the
question
justice
harlan
which
i
think
is
the
heart
of
it
and
that
is
whether
the
wife
was
or
was
not
authorized.
i
clearly
would
not
be
authorized,
but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
simply
was
that
this
turns
on
the
matter
of
the
effect
of
the
consent
and
not
on
whether
they
had
to
hunt
her
around
and
it
took
them
an
hour
to
get
it
rather
than
being
taken
there
quickly.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
didn’t
present
that
in
our
petition,
because
i
didn’t
think
i
could
get
certiorari
on
that
question.
it
was
found
she
was
unusually
nervous,
it
was
found
that
the
police
discouraged
her
mother
from
staying
in
the
house.
it
was
found
that
she
had
been
threatened
by
a
captain
of
the
new
hampshire
police,
that
afternoon
told
if
she
could
go
to
jail
if
she
withheld
anything.
she
testified
she
felt
she
had
to.
i
think
the
point
is
and
the
reason
i
stress
is,
that
in
any
case
if
you
make
the
constitutional
effect
of
a
wife’s
consent
turn
--
if
you
make
the
constitutionality
of
a
search
and
seizure
turn
on
the
wife’s
consent,
you’re
inviting
all
kinds
of
over
reaching
and
pressures
from
taking
advantage
of
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
police.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
oh
yes.
well,
you
know,
what
happened
months
afterwards
is
always
hard
to
reconstruct.
voluntariness
is
a
matter
of
degree.
i
think
there’s
an
element,
i’m
not
--
the
real
point
i’ve
stressed
three
facts
here
that
i
try
to
build
this
few
minutes
available.
first,
that
these
were
petitioner’s
own
private
belongings
and
i
would
say
that
the
wife’s
general
custody
and
possession
does
not
extend
to
that.
secondly,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
do
not
deny
that.
second,
because
at
that
point,
the
officers
would
have
been
engaged
in
pursuing
their
business
with
mrs.
coolidge.
whereas,
at
this
point,
there
were
--
and
that
would
have
been
a
fallout,
an
incident.
at
this
stage,
they
had
followed
here
into
the
bedroom,
simply
seeking
to
make
her
the
instrument
of
defeating
her
husband’s
constitutional
rights.
and
the
third
point
i
stress
is
that
he
was
available
and
could’ve
been
asked.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
i
have
time
to
elaborate
it
by
i
submit
to
you
that
when
you
stop
and
think
about
it,
the
only
consequence
of
giving
effect,
legal
effect
to
the
wife’s
dissent
here
would
be
to
enable
the
police
to
circumvent
the
chance
that
he
would
disagree.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
consistent
with
this
apparent
letter
of
the
constitution,
so
that
we
think
on
either
ground,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
would
submit
to
you
sir
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
his
willingness
to
do
that
on
one
occasion,
what
was
it,
many
days
before
--
no,
four
days
before
excuse
me,
should
not
be
taken
of
a
surrender
of
the
privilege
of
making
up
his
own
mind
on
a
later
occasion
when
he
said
nothing,
he
certainly
didn’t
say
to
her
or
them
or
when
they
get
back,
got
married,
dear
wife,
remember,
you
have
authority
to
turn
my
most
personal
possessions
over
to
the
police
anytime
you
feel
like
it.
i
don’t
think
that
was
the
effect
of
his
conduct,
the
fair
of
that
could
either,
i
submit
that’s
the
answer
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
first
degree
murder
case
here
in
forma
pauperis
and
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire.
two
constitutional
questions
are
presented,
the
first
is
whether
a
search
warrant
issued
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
upon
the
un-sworn
reports,
oral
reports
of
his
subordinates,
while
he
is
in
active
charge
of
a
criminal
investigation
and
when
he
will
actually
himself
lead
the
prosecution,
is
a
valid
search
warrant
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
and
of
course
we
submit
that
it
plainly
is
not.
the
second
question
which
relates
to
an
entirely
different
incident
so
that
we
may
win
on
either
ground.
the
second
question
is
whether
a
wife’s
acquiescence
in
the
taking
of
her
husband’s
personal
belongings
will
validate
what
otherwise
is
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
as
this
being
a
state
case.
these
two
questions
are
better
understood
if
i
outline
the
salient
points
concerning
the
case.
on
january
13,
1964,
a
young
girl
pamela
mason
left
her
house
in
manchester,
new
hampshire
on
a
baby
sitting
assignment.
she
disappeared,
eight
days
later,
her
body
was
found
by
the
side
of
the
principal
interstate
highway
leading
south.
the
state’s
theory
later
became
that
she
had
been
shot
by
a
22-caliber
mossberg
rifle,
also,
her
throat
had
been
cut
with
a
knife
and
that
the
body
had
been
dumped
there
about
9
o’clock
or
9:30,
perhaps
that
same
evening
when
it
was
covered
by
an
unusually
heavy
snow
storm
and
then
after
a
rainstorm
eight
days
later
became
visible.
this
was
a
disappearance
and
crime
which
excited
enormous
attention
in
manchester
and
indeed
through
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
at
the
time,
the
police
broadcast
appeals
for
people
to
come
forward
with
the
names
of
anyone
who
were
out
of
the
house
that
evening
and
eventually
one
of
petitioner’s
neighbors
reported
to
the
police
that
he
had
been
out
of
his
house
that
night
and
they
went
to
the
house
on
january
28,
police,
two
of
them
and
questioned
him
about
his
whereabouts.
he
gave
an
explanation
which
unfortunately
for
him
later
turned
out
to
be
false.
he
also
showed
the
police
some
guns
that
he
had
in
the
house
at
that
time,
spoke
to
them
very
freely
and
they
asked
him
if
he
would
be
willing
to
go
up
to
concorde
to
the
headquarters
of
the
state
police
to
take
a
lie
detector
test,
he
said
that
he
would
and
since
he
was
working
as
a
bakery
truck
driver,
asked
that
it
be
on
his
day
off
sunday.
then
on
sunday,
february
2,
they
did
indeed
go
up
to
the
state
police
headquarters
and
he
took
the
lie
detector
test
which
produced
no
affirmative
indication
if
his
guilt,
but
at
that
time
he
did
admit
that
he
had
embezzled
a
small
sum
of
money
from
his
employer.
when
they
went
back
to
manchester,
he
was
questioned
late
into
the
night
by
the
police.
he
was
not
actually
arrested
in
a
formal
sense
till
after
midnight
but
the
trial
judge
found
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
leave
at
any
time
after
they
had
returned
from
manchester
--
from
concorde.
the
first
search
and
seizure
of
which
we
complain
occurred
on
that
day
february
2,
while
petitioner
was
in
custody
at
the
manchester
police
station,
two
different
officers
who
had
never
been
to
his
house
before
went
to
his
house
and
with
the
acquiescence
of
his
wife
mrs.
coolidge
obtained
his
guns
and
clothing
and
took
them
away.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
were
the
same
guns
the
different
police
had
seen
before
and
there’s
no
indication
that
these
two
men
had
any
information
about
what
had
happened
before.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
she
did
and
i
thought
it
would
be
convenient
mr.
chief
justice
if
i’m
going
to
argue
the
question
about
the
attorney
general’s
warrant
first
and
i
thought
it
might
be
convenient
if
i
refrain
from
stating
the
facts
about
this
search
which
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
took
place
chronologically
first
until
i
come
to
what
will
be
the
second
branch
of
my
argument
and
then
i
will
address
myself
to
the
specific
questions
that
you
mentioned.
the
second
--
so
i
say
petitioner
was
held
at
the
police
station,
he
was
held
overnight
on
this
larceny
charge
and
then
he
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance.
so
that
he
was
not
imprisoned
during
the
ensuing
weeks.
the
second
search
and
seizure
occurred
some
weeks
later
on
february
19,
you
see
almost
three
weeks
after
the
first.
attorney
general
menard
who
had
taken
active
charge
of
the
investigation
in
prosecution,
called
a
conference
in
his
office
in
concorde
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
the
evidence
that
had
best
far
have
been
developed.
there
were
president,
representatives
of
the
manchester
police
and
the
state
police
and
two
assistant
attorney
general.
those
officers
presented
to
him
what
their
investigation
had
revealed
presenting
it,
the
trial
judge
explicitly
found
to
him
in
his
capacity
as
the
chief
prosecuting
officer
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
there
was
no
record
made
of
that
and
none
of
what
was
said
was
under
oath.
police
chief
mcgranery
did
testify
during
the
trial
on
voir
dier
concerning
what
took
place
but
there
was
no
record
and
as
i
say
it
was
not
under
oath.
this
was
just
i
think
quite
genuinely,
subordinates
reviewing
with
the
chief
investigator
and
later
prosecutor
what
they’d
been
able
to
develop.
then
at
the
end
of
that
conference
after
about
two
hours,
we
know
from
chief
mcgranery’s
description,
he
asked
for
an
arrest
warrant
and
four
search
warrants
against
the
petitioner
and
the
attorney
general
having
a
commission
as
justice
and
peace,
took
chief
mcgranery’s
oath
to
the
complaint
and
then
he
himself
issued
the
five
warrants.
one
of
which
we’re
concerned
with
here,
the
warrant
for
an
old
pontiac
automobile.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
--
i
know
that
he
--
that
mr.
menard
did,
i
suspect
that
others
did,
new
hampshire
have
an
extraordinary
practice
at
this
time,
chief
mcgranery
testified
that
they
never
went
out
of
the
police
department
to
get
a
search
warrant,
they
just
had
the
inspectors
and
captains,
old
commissioned
justices
of
the
peace,
he
testified
this.
and
that
is
not,
i
don’t
want
to
overstate
it,
that
is
not
the
practice
today
because
the
statute
has
been
changed
but
it
was
a
settled
practice
at
this
time
so
this
wasn’t
denied,
it
happenstance
apparently.
'that
evening,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference
here,
there
was
a
challenge
to
mr.
coolidge’s
arrest.
it’s
very
clear
in
the
headings
to
petitioner’s
brief
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
that
they
challenged
the
arrest
warrants
on
the
same
grounds
as
the
search
warrants.
it’s
one
of
the
black
letter
head
things
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
does
not
make
any
difference
to
our
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes,
i
assume
that
and
hope
that
i
may.
i
--
that
evening,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
in
his
house
pursuant
to
the
arrest
warrant,
or
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
later,
the
pontiac
car
was
towed
to
the
police
station.
it
was
searched
the
next
day
and
then
again
a
year
later.
the
search
is
important
without
going
into
the
details
because
in
the
course
of
vacuuming
the
car,
the
police
obtained
tiny
particles
and
later
examined
under
a
microscope
which
an
experts
sought
to
associate
with
particles
that
they
said
were
substantially
similar
taken
from
the
clothes
of
this
unfortunate
girl.
and
the
expert
testimony
was
that
there
was
some
extraordinarily
load,
a
high
degree
of
probability
that
the
body
must
have
been
in
the
car.
this
i
would
say,
this
evidence
of
which
the
court
first
refused
to
suppress
on
our
motion
before
trial
and
which
was
admitted
over
our
objection
pressed
all
the
way
through
the
trial
an
on
appeal,
was
very
essential
to
the
prosecutions
case.
this
is
not
conceivably
a
case
where
you
could
say
that
this
was
harmless
error
within
this
court’s
rule.
indeed,
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
noted
three
or
four
or
five
times
the
very
dubious
character
of
the
evidence
against
the
--
of
the
proof
against
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
on
265,
it
says
the
proof
was
not
wholly
free
from
weakness,
then
it
speaks
of
how
the
limitations
of
time
cast
out
on
the
state’s
theory
and
how
further
doubts
were
cast
by
certain
other
evidence
and
how
the
ballistics
evidence
blow
up
to
put
it
colloquially
in
the
state’s
face
during
the
trial.
so
that
this,
i’m
simply
emphasizing
the
importance
of
this
question.
now,
our
first
contention
here
is
basically
a
very
simple
one
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
was
simply
negating
any
possibility
that
the
rule,
it’s
the
case
decided
the
same
day
as
cooper
in
california,
i
can’t
think
of
the
name
of
it
now,
could
be
applicable
here.
that
is
that
it
was
harmless
error.
i
think
that
isn’t
true
and
i
do
emphasize
that
this
was
a
very
close
case
on
the
trial
so
that
this
evidence,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
was
important
capital,
that’s
right,
was
important
to
the
prosecution.
now
our
first
and
primarily
contention
as
i
say,
is
that
the
admission
of
evidence
obtained
under
the
search
warrant
violated
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights
because
the
warrant
which
is
issued
by
the
chief
prosecutor
instead
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
and
i
need
hardly
remind
the
court
that
it
has
said
over
and
over
again
since
johnson
against
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
jackson’s
opinion
that
one
of
the
indispensable
conditions
to
a
valid
warrant
is
that
the
inferences
from
the
facts
which
lead
to
the
complaint
be
drawn
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
instead
of
being
judged
by
the
officer
engaged
in
the
often
competitive
enterprise
of
ferreting
out
crime.
the
closest
case
unquestionably
is
mancusi
v.
deforte
where
the
court
dealt
with
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
that
had
been
issued
by
the
district
attorney
in
new
york
and
justice
harlan
in
writing
the
opinion
considered
whether
this
would
be
–
whether
the
evidence
would
have
been
admissible
if
the
subpoena
could
be
treated
as
a
search
warrant.
and
he
said
no
and
there
was
no
dissent
on
that
point
in
the
court
because
the
district
attorney
was
not
a
detached
and
neutral
officer.
now,
the
state
replies
that
attorney
general
menard
before
he
signed
the
warrants
took
off
his
black
prosecutorial
hat
and
put
on
his
white
justice
of
the
peace
hat.
we
think
that
that
purely
formal
step
did
not,
indeed
could
not
confer
on
him
a
neutrality.
a
disinterestedness
under
these
circumstances.
he
was
i
say
inactive
charge
of
this
prosecution.
he
was
the
man
that
the
press
had
been
badgering
for
days.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
he
was
inactive
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
i
would
emphasize
too
he
was
inactive
charge
and
he
l
for
the
prosecution
at
the
trial.
he
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
he
had
promised
vigorous,
ruthless
investigation.
just
four
days
before
he
signed
the
warrants
and
the
banner
headline
was
menard
has
suspect.
he
was
thoroughly
wrapped
up
in
the
investigation
and
its
success.
now,
i
don’t
direct
this
at
him
personally,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
him
and
have
a
high
regard
for
him
but
it’s
beyond
any
man's
human
capability
to
be
neutral
and
detached
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
don’t
argue
that.
it
has
been
argued
in
the
courts
below,
i’m
prepared
to
assume
that
there
was
probable
cause
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
raise
a
question
and
do
raise
a
question
whether
where
the
police
rely
on
the
warrant
and
they
do
not
assert
any
exigent
circumstances,
where
that
matter
really
is
not
looked
into
in
the
court
below.
i
would
suggest
that
under
giordenello
against
the
united
states,
the
shift
in
claim
is
not
available
here
but
i
would
--
i’d
go
on
justice
white
and
i
was
about
to
deal
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
the
three
other
grounds
that
the
state
invokes
here,
apart
from
the
warrant
because
i
do
have
to
speak
to.
and
one
is
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
united
states
against
carol
and
ending
with
the
courts
opinion
which
you’ve
delivered
in
chambers
and
maroney.
i
say
that
those
cases
are
entirely
distinguishable.
it’s
one
thing
for
the
police
to
stop
a
car
in
motion
on
the
highway
when
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
driver
is
either
carrying
contraband
or
fleeing
the
scene
of
a
crime.
it’s
quite
another
i
submit
to
go
to
a
man’s
home
and
to
search
about
in
an
automobile
parked
in
his
driveway
which
is
not
in
motion
and
its
not
about
to
be
in
motion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
this
case,
of
course
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
manchester
police.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
what
i
meant
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
about
to
be
put
in
motion,
there
was
no
indication
of
an
exigent
circumstance.
i
think
the
burden
is
on
the
police,
if
they
are
seeking
to
shove
and
that
there
are
some
reason
for
not
getting
a
warrant
which
they
can
hardly
do
here
where
they’d
gotten
the
warrant
that
very
day
and
taking
the
time
to
do
but
i
think
the
burden
generally
speaking
is
on
the
police
to
show
some
exigency.
now,
if
you
got
the
car
going
carrying
contraband
with
somebody
who’s
engaged
in
that,
you
have
some
reason
to
think
you
should
act
quick
but
i
see
no
reason
at
all
candor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
no
way
if
you
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
yes
of
course
that
was
what
divided
the
court
in
chambers
and
maroney,
but
at
least
there,
one
was
able
to
say,
well,
what’s
the
difference
between
searching
it
then
and
there
and
taking
it
down
to
the
police
station
and
searching
it
later
at
the
police
station.
i’m
not
making
anything
turn
on
the
fact
that
this
car
was
not
searched
until
the
next
day
or
until
a
year
later.
i
make
nothing
about.
i
disclaim
any
emphasis
on
that.
i
make
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
this
was
not
incident
to
the
arrest
because
the
petitioner
had
been
arrested
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
earlier
and
was
in
custody
at
that
time
and
i
make
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
the
car
was
not
stopped
under
circumstances
indicating
that
if
you
took
time
to
get
a
warrant,
you
might
miss
your
chance
to
stop
it
and
search
it.
indeed,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
car
was
described
as
the
container
of
the
things
that
were
being
sought.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
was
not
described
as
the
object
to
the
search.
indeed,
i
think
that
it
indicates
the
police
weren’t
really
interested
in
the
car
except
as
a
container
or
vehicle.
and
i
would
suggest
perhaps
i
can
put
the
point
by
oversimplifying
it
most
dramatically.
i
don’t
see
the
difference
between
searching
for
this
object
in
that
car
parked
in
a
man’s
garage
and
saying
that
you
don’t
have
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
for
it
if
this
is
on
the
bench
in
the
garage
or
if
it’s
in
an
office
in
the
house
or
in
the
bedroom.
it’s
really
just
as
movable.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
carrol
involved
stopping
the
car
on
the
highway
when
it
was
in
motion
and
the
contraband
was
being
carried.
and
the
language
in
carroll
is
very
explicit
on
that
point.
the
chief
justice
taft
doesn’t
it
spoke
of
a
right
of
free
passage
except
under
these
circumstances,
he
was
talking
about
people
that
are
moving,
things
that
are
fleeting
as
your
honor
put
it
in
chambers
and
maroney.
not
about
something
which
is
simply
a
container
at
the
man’s
house.
i
press
again,
if
what
one
is
thinking
about
it
is
a
small
chapel,
what
difference
is
there
today
between
saying
it
may
disappear
because
its
in
the
glove
compartment
in
a
car
that
is
parked
by
house
and
saying
it
may
disappear
because
its
out
of
bench
in
the
barn
or
is
in
an
office
in
the
building,
where
it
could
just
as
readily
be
put
in
the
car
and
carried
away.
i
submit
that
once
your
honors
stepped
over
this
line,
the
whole
trend
of
law
of
searches
and
seizure
which
encourages
better
police
work
and
puts
a
disinterested
magistrate
between
the
police
and
the
citizen
would
virtually
begun
i
submit.
i’ve
always
skeptical
students
who
parade
horribles
to
me
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
would
be
true
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
said
i
wasn’t,
but
i
didn’t
think
i
had
to
dispute
that
part
and
i
would
point
out
mr.
chief
justice
that
from
silverthorne
lumber
through
(inaudible),
this
court
had
consistently
held
that
the
fact
that
you
might
get
a
search
warrant
the
right
way
will
not
excuse
a
search
and
seizure
made
without
a
warrant
or
upon
an
invalid
one.
and
of
course
the
reason
is
clear,
if
the
police
could
justify
by
saying
well,
we
could
have
gotten
the
warrant
the
right
way,
we
could
have
gotten
the
neutral
man
to
sign
this.
in
the
first
place
there’s
always
a
little
bit
of
uncertainty
or
speculation
after
the
event.
but
in
the
second
place,
the
whole
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
undermined
because
they
would
always
come
to
court
later
and
defend
it
if
they
could.
this
was
covered
again
in
mancusi
and
deforte
and
the
opinion
quotes
similar
language
by
justice
holmes
of
the
silverthorne
lumber
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
i
argued
it?
yes,
but
i
don’t
stress
the
point,
i
don’t
want
to
conceal
the
facts
that
i
don’t
stress
it,
we
don’t
volunteer
that
there
was
a
probable
cause.
i
don’t
know
where
it
was
it
not,
but
i’m
not
making
any
claim
about
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
now,
i
think
i
should
go
on
to
the
other
and
more
difficult
theoretically
more
difficult
issue
in
the
case
which
is
the
effect
of
the
wife’s
consent
to
the
taking
of
the
22-caliber
mossberg
rifle
and
some
clothing
from
petitioner’s
closet,
bedroom
closet.
very
briefly,
the
facts
were
these.
on
that
evening
on
february
2
while
he
was
being
detained
at
the
police
station,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
she
was.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
entirely
free
and
open
in
responding
showing
anything
and
responding
to
anything
they
ask.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
she
was
present.
i
would
simply
say
that
the
circumstances
had
changed
so
much
by
february
2
when
he
was
being
held
in
custody
that
neither
she
nor
the
police
would
be
entitled
to
infer
from
his
conduct
then
that
he
was
authorizing
her
to
make
up
his
mind
for
him
later.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
no
evidence
of
his
saying
anything
to
her
which
would
cause
her
to
draw
a
different
inference
so
i
suggest
there
was
a
marked
difference
in
the
circumstances.
and
his
willingness
to
do,
to
make
that
decision
at
that
time
does
not
seem
to
me
they
properly
authorized
her
to
infer
that
she
could
make
the
decisions.
may
i
speak
very
briefly
of
the
main
points
with
respect
to
the
wife’s
consent?
first,
i
would
emphasize
that
there
was
a
seizure
and
i
think
in
the
constitutional
sense
a
search
here.
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
said
no.
i
can
illustrate
the
point
best
by
putting
another
homely
little
example.
suppose
that
an
fbi
agent
were
to
come
to
my
office
in
lindale
hall
and
say
there
was
a
valuable
manuscript
missing
from
the
library
of
this
court
and
to
describe
it
and
say
they
had
some
reason
to
think
it
was
encumbered.
in
some
further
that
i
say,
oh
that’s
curious,
i’ve
seen
something
looks
very
like
that
in
my
colleague
professor
dawson’s
office
dawn
the
hall.
he
keeps
it
in
among
the
books
in
his
library.
come
on
i’ll
show
it
to
you,
each
of
us
has
a
key
that
fits
every
other
office
and
we
occasionally
go
in
to
borrow
books.
i
take
it
that
if
i’d
led
the
fbi
into
his
office
and
showed
them
that
document
at
their
request
that
everyone
would
say
there
was
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
quite
true,
fond
of
him,
but
that
goes
to
the
question
justice
harlan
which
i
think
is
the
heart
of
it
and
that
is
whether
the
wife
was
or
was
not
authorized.
i
clearly
would
not
be
authorized,
but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
simply
was
that
this
turns
on
the
matter
of
the
effect
of
the
consent
and
not
on
whether
they
had
to
hunt
her
around
and
it
took
them
an
hour
to
get
it
rather
than
being
taken
there
quickly.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
didn’t
present
that
in
our
petition,
because
i
didn’t
think
i
could
get
certiorari
on
that
question.
it
was
found
she
was
unusually
nervous,
it
was
found
that
the
police
discouraged
her
mother
from
staying
in
the
house.
it
was
found
that
she
had
been
threatened
by
a
captain
of
the
new
hampshire
police,
that
afternoon
told
if
she
could
go
to
jail
if
she
withheld
anything.
she
testified
she
felt
she
had
to.
i
think
the
point
is
and
the
reason
i
stress
is,
that
in
any
case
if
you
make
the
constitutional
effect
of
a
wife’s
consent
turn
--
if
you
make
the
constitutionality
of
a
search
and
seizure
turn
on
the
wife’s
consent,
you’re
inviting
all
kinds
of
over
reaching
and
pressures
from
taking
advantage
of
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
police.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
oh
yes.
well,
you
know,
what
happened
months
afterwards
is
always
hard
to
reconstruct.
voluntariness
is
a
matter
of
degree.
i
think
there’s
an
element,
i’m
not
--
the
real
point
i’ve
stressed
three
facts
here
that
i
try
to
build
this
few
minutes
available.
first,
that
these
were
petitioner’s
own
private
belongings
and
i
would
say
that
the
wife’s
general
custody
and
possession
does
not
extend
to
that.
secondly,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
do
not
deny
that.
second,
because
at
that
point,
the
officers
would
have
been
engaged
in
pursuing
their
business
with
mrs.
coolidge.
whereas,
at
this
point,
there
were
--
and
that
would
have
been
a
fallout,
an
incident.
at
this
stage,
they
had
followed
here
into
the
bedroom,
simply
seeking
to
make
her
the
instrument
of
defeating
her
husband’s
constitutional
rights.
and
the
third
point
i
stress
is
that
he
was
available
and
could’ve
been
asked.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
i
have
time
to
elaborate
it
by
i
submit
to
you
that
when
you
stop
and
think
about
it,
the
only
consequence
of
giving
effect,
legal
effect
to
the
wife’s
dissent
here
would
be
to
enable
the
police
to
circumvent
the
chance
that
he
would
disagree.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
consistent
with
this
apparent
letter
of
the
constitution,
so
that
we
think
on
either
ground,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
would
submit
to
you
sir
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
his
willingness
to
do
that
on
one
occasion,
what
was
it,
many
days
before
--
no,
four
days
before
excuse
me,
should
not
be
taken
of
a
surrender
of
the
privilege
of
making
up
his
own
mind
on
a
later
occasion
when
he
said
nothing,
he
certainly
didn’t
say
to
her
or
them
or
when
they
get
back,
got
married,
dear
wife,
remember,
you
have
authority
to
turn
my
most
personal
possessions
over
to
the
police
anytime
you
feel
like
it.
i
don’t
think
that
was
the
effect
of
his
conduct,
the
fair
of
that
could
either,
i
submit
that’s
the
answer
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you.
