(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cox,
before
you
go
to
february
2nd,
could
i
ask
you
about
january
28th?
was
mrs.
coolidge
present
when
the
police
went
out
to
the
coolidge
home
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
i
get
an
intimation
from
her
record
that
the
police
asked
questions
and
mr.
coolidge
showed
him
his
guns
and
helped
them
inspect
the
car
and
agreed
to
take
the
lie
detector
test
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
she
was
present
throughout
this
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
my
next
question.
if
there
is
anything
from
which
a
consent
can
be
inferred
in
january
28th,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
would
support
an
inference
that
it
was
withdrawn
between
january
28
and
february
2?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
all
receiving
the
plain
side
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
sentence
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there
has
been
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
by?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
only
aside
from
the
warrant
under
new
hampshire
law
that
the
state
impound
the
vehicle?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
aside
from
that,
would
you
have
--
are
there
any
grounds
for
seizing
the
vehicle
under
new
hampshire
law
and
impounding
it
as
evidence
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
it
is,
can
you
seize
--
are
you
authorized
to
impound
the
automobiles
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
search
warrant,
the
only
possible
item
would
be
the
petitioner’s
vehicle
and
the
vacuum
sweepings
which
were
obtained
from
it
subsequently
to
its
custody.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
vacuum
sweepings
of
certain
part,
minute
particles
which
were
taken
out
of
the
vehicle
after
it
was
in
police
custody.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
actually
you
think
that
the
situation
here
is
as
though
the
wife
had
taken
the
guns
out
of
the
closet
and
taking
them
down
to
the
police
station
--
justice
byron
r.
white
here
are
my
husband’s
guns.
now,
she
may
not
had
authority
to
do
that,
that’s
the
--
but
do
you
say
that
if
the
police
had
taken
them,
there
nevertheless
wouldn’t
have
been
any
search
and
seizures
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
weapon
you
say
the
wife
ave?

byron
r.
