mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
issues,
search
and
seizure
issues
which
have
been
raised
here
by
the
petitioner
turned
on
the
admissibility
of
--
or
rather
suggest
that
the
vehicle
which
belonged
to
the
petitioner
and
certain
vacuum
sweeping
is
taken
from
it
subsequent
to
the
time
it
came
into
the
custody
of
the
police
were
obtained
by
unlawful
means
because
of
the
issuance
of
an
invalid
search
warrant.
and
secondly,
that
certain
items
of
clothing
particularly
and
a
murder
weapon,
a
weapon
which
was
subsequently
testified
to
as
being
the
weapon
which
fired
a
fatal
bullets
was
obtained,
interrogation
of
his
rights
from
his
wife
at
the
time
when
he
was
not
present.
taking
the
first
issue
that
the
petitioner
raises,
we
suggest
that
the
petitioner
is
stressing
form
rather
than
substance.
the
basis
of
their
contention
is
that
the
search
warrants
were
invalid
because
they
were
not
issued
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
since
the
magistrate
so
to
speak
who
issued
the
warrants
was
the
attorney
general
who’s
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
then
and
subsequently
who
tried
the
case
to
the
jury.
and
the
real
issue
we
say
is,
were
the
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights
affected
or
denied
him
in
any
way
by
what
actually
happened
here,
taking,
looking
at
the
substance
of
what
happened,
the
trial
court
has
specifically
ruled
that
on
the
basis
of
the
following
facts,
any
magistrate,
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
would
have
found
probable
cause
and
would
have
issued
the
search
warrants
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
search
warrant,
the
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
police
officers
were
very
properly
under
the
circumstances
seeking
a
search
warrant
and
i’m
simply
stating
that
to
deny
the
substance
of
what
happened
here
and
say
that
the
search
warrants
were
illegally
issued
under
these
circumstances
would
be
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
this
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
say
he
was
neutral
in
fact,
yes
mr.
chief
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
which
were
presented
to
them
which
were
as
follows.
that
on
the
evening
of
the
murder,
the
petitioner
was
missing
from
his
home
from
5
to
11
pm,
the
time
of
death
was
fixed
at
about
9,
between
8
and
10
pm
that
evening,
at
the
time
of
death
at
rather
9:30
pm
that
evening,
the
petitioner
admitted
and
other
witness
testified
to
the
fact
that
his
vehicle,
his
1951
vehicle
was
on
the
highway
opposite
from
where
the
body
of
the
victim
was
discovered
eight
days
later,
plus
the
fact
that
he
tried
to
obtain
alibis
for
his
whereabouts
on
the
evening
of
the
13th
from
other
people
plus
the
fact
that
the
ballistics
indicated
that
his
weapon
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
no,
i
don’t
think
the
evidence
shows
that
he
knew
all
of
this
at
that
time,
this,
the
purpose
of
the
conference
was
to
acquaint
the
attorney
general
at
this
point
of
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
he
issued
the
arrest
warrant
and
four
search
warrants.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
no,
at
that
time,
all
the
facts
had
been
presented
to
him,
all
of
some
which
he
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
to
him,
some
of
which
he
knew
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
for
both
reasons
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
testimony
of
chief
macgraney
was
that
the
conference
was
called
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
everything
that
had
been
--
was
relevant
to
that
--
the
case
at
that
time.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
and
also
to
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
and
also
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
would
say
he
was
neutral
throughout
the
whole
thing
because
at
this
point,
when
all
of
this
according
to
chief
macgraney,
when
this
was
which
he
testified
to,
and
this
was
presented
to
him,
he
did
not
have
all
these
facts
before
him.
he
was
appointed
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
he
was
--
under
the
new
hampshire
law,
the
attorney
general
is
the
chief
prosecutor
and
in
that
capacity,
he
has
control
of
any
criminal
case
that
particularly
the
murder
case
that
comes
to
his
attention.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
can
accept
that
to
a
point
mr.
justice
marshall
but
not
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
point
is
that
in
this
case,
there
was
a
distinguishing
factor.
the
chief
prosecutor
also
held
a
commission
here
as
a
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
in
effect
he
was
also
a
judge,
yes
to
a
certain
extent,
to
the
extent
that
he
could
issue
a
search
warrant
lawfully
under
new
hampshire
law.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
new
hampshire
law
was
not
that
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
don’t
believe
that
that
would
be
proper
in
any
state
and
that
was
not
the
law
in
new
hampshire
but
it
was
the
law
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
could
issue
a
search
warrant
under
proper
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
did
say
that
a
justice
of
the
peace
could
do
so
and
in
fact,
many
justice
of
the
peace
who
are
not
even
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
don’t
quite
follow
the
questionnaire
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
that
nature,
no
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
when
he
signed
the
search
warrants
and
issued
them,
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
him
to
do
so
we
state
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
by
the
authority
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
he
applies
for
a
commission
and
it’s
issued
to
him
by
the
governor
and
the
governor’s
counsel
and
a
commission,
he
has
sworn
after
the
commission
has
issued
before
to
other
justices
of
the
peace
and
the
commission
constitutes
his
warrant
to
act
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
this
is
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
since
the
initiation
of
the
constitution
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
back
in
1700
something
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
not
the
attorney
general,
anyone
who
applies
for
a
commission
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
is
issued
a
warrant
by
--
a
commission
rather
by
the
governor
and
counsel.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
he
was
issued
a
commission.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
life
imprisonment
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i’m
not
sure
that
it
is
but
the
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
trial
justice
does
the
sentencing
in
a
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
in
a
capital
case,
it’s
up
to
the
jury
to
recommend
capital
punishment
or
not.
in
this
case
they
chose
not
to
recommend
it.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
there
has
been
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
by
the
trial
justice.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
there
are
quite
a
few
justices
of
the
peace.
many
of
whom
who
are
not
even
members
of
the
bar.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
and
this
has
been
the
--
incidentally
the
practices
mr.
cox
pointed
out.
in
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
the
legislature
changed
the
law
and
now
search
warrants
may
be
only
issued
by
a
justice
of
a
district
or
a
municipal
court.
the
prior
practice
of
any
justice
of
the
peace
having
authority
to
issue
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
has
been
changed.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
hundreds,
literally
hundreds,
the
commission
is
a
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
wouldn’t
say
there
are
thousands,
i
would
say
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
population
is
about
700,000.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
and
i
can’t
really
answer
your
question
definite,
definite
till
it
say
that
there
are
--
maybe
thousands
but
it
is
a
great
number.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
every
--
practically,
every
real
estate
broker,
every
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
--
every
accountant,
everyone,
many
offices
in
which
legal,
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
every
lawyer,
every
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
every
legal
secretary
practically
are
all
justices
of
peace.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
has
happened
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
it
has
happened
in
the
past
on
many
occasions.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
never
has
been
raised
before
and
in
fact,
that
practice
amongst
the
police
which
has
changed
substantially
back
in
around
this
time
after
this
case
was
for
a
police
officer
to
go
to
a
fellow
police
officer
who
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
have
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
issued.
the
practice
in
new
hampshire
never
was
for
police
officers
to
go
to
a
magistrate,
hardly
ever
to
go
to
a
magistrate
of
a
district
court
and
have
it
issued.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
he
probably
was.
he
was
the
chief
of
police
of
the
largest
city.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
because
then
he
would
be
passing
judgment
on
himself
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
think
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
well,
the
point
was
that
the
attorney
general
didn’t
have
the
information,
the
chief
of
police
did.
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
further
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
under
the
search
warrants,
the
only
item
of
evidence
that
was
seized
was
the
1951
pontiac
and
there
is
some
question
about
whether
that
was
under
the
search
warrant.
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
automobile
of
the
petitioner.
at
the
time
that
they
arrested
him,
the
automobile
was
parked
in
its
driveway
and
the
police
arrested
him,
took
him
to
the
police
station,
called
a
tow
truck
and
the
tow
truck
took
an
hour
to
an
hour
and
half
to
get
there
then
that
the
vehicle
was
removed.
the
search
warrant
authorized
the
executing
officer
to
search
the
vehicle
but
it
did
not
specifically
identify
the
vehicle
as
an
item
to
be
seized.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
i
think
that
on
several
independent
grounds
on
probable
cause
alone
which
i’ve
outlined
on
the
seizure
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
arrest
warrant
was
ever
challenged
here
but
maybe
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
only
that
it
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
and
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
under
the
statute
as
i
recall
it,
the
rsa
595,
one
of
the
section
enumerates
the
items
which
maybe
specifically
seized
and
the
fourth
or
fifth
one
is
a
general
one
which
dates
on
anything
connected
to
the
crime
for
which
the
respondent
is
arrested.
so,
under
that
particular
category
of
the
statute,
i
would
answer
your
question
yes,
it
would
be
something
that
could
be
seized
since
it
was
an
item
of
evidence
pertaining
directly
to
the
crime
for
which
he
was
arrested.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
that
is
what
in
controversy
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
vacuum
sweepings
were
examined
by
experts
and
the
--
they
were
segregated
under
a
microscope
and
also
items,
similar
items
were
taken
from
the
clothing
of
the
victim
and
compared
by
the
expert
and
on
probabilities,
he
testified
that
these
particular
particles
probably
had
a
common
source,
this
was
the
summoned
substance
of
the
evidence
on
that
point.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
no,
they
were
mostly
plastics,
paints,
metals,
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
date
of
the
conviction
was
june
of
1965
your
honor,
thank
you,
a
year
after
--
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
crime
took
place.
to
summarize
the
first
point,
we
simply
contend
that
on
a
substance
of
what
happened
here,
there
was
probable
cause,
the
trial
court
found
that
any
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
would
have
found
probable
cause
and
the
way
we
read
the
aguilar
case,
the
giordenello
and
the
other
cases
is
that
all
--
this
is
all
that
the
constitution
requires
is
that
on
the
basis
of
adequate
facts
presented
to
a
magistrate
who
was
in
fact
neutral
and
detached,
these
the
finding
of
the
search
warrants
are
issued.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
next
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
has
to
do
with
certain
items
of
clothing
and
the
murder
weapon
which
was
obtained
by
the
police
from
the
wife
on
the
date
of
february
2,
1964.
i
would
like
to
just
go
over
the
facts
briefly
with
respect
to
how
these
items
were
obtained
because
i
think
it’s
very
crucial
to
sustain
the
--
to
explain
rather
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
there
in
fact
was
no
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
murder
weapon
and
the
clothes.
as
mr.
cox
pointed
out,
on
january
the
28th,
when
the
police
were
conducting
a
very
general
investigation,
not
knowing
who
they
were
looking
for
or
even
what
they
were
looking
for
in
terms
of
a
murder
weapon
and
based
on
the
report
only
of
a
neighbor
that
this
particular
individual,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
not
at
home
on
that
evening
between
5
and
11
o’clock,
they
went
to
his
home
and
asked
him
about
where
he
was
that
evening,
during
the
course
of
this
visit,
he
freely
discussed
his
activities
on
that
evening.
during
the
course
of
this
visit,
he
took
them
out
and
showed
them
his
cars
and
he
brought
out
three
weapons
to
show
them.
the
police
officers
who
were
there
listed
the
three
weapons
and
neither
of
these
weapons
was
the
murder
weapon.
while
they
were
there,
they
asked
him
he
would
mind
taking
a
lie
detector
test
and
he
said
no
but
he
was
a
bakery
truck
driver
and
could
not
get
off
except
on
a
sunday
so
could
it
be
on
a
sunday.
and
they
set
a
date
for
the
following
sunday
which
is
february
the
2nd.
on
february
2,
one
of
the
officers
that
was
there
called
him
and
he
came
down
to
the
station
voluntarily,
they
stayed
at
the
station,
this
is
at
1
o’clock
in
the
afternoon,
they
stayed
till
about
3
to
3:30
talking
about
whether
he
should
take
a
test
or
not
and
finally,
he
agreed
to
go
with
them
to
state
police
headquarters
in
concorde.
before
or
rather
during
the
test,
there,
they
turned
them
over
to
sergeant
macbane
at
that
time
with
the
state
police
who
administered
the
lie
detector
test
which
was
inconclusive
but
in
the
course
of
administering
the
test,
the
petitioner
admitted
a
larceny
of
$300.00
from
his
employer.
the
police
then
took
the
petitioner
back
to
manchester
and
since
he
had
been
giving
him
conflicting
stories
about
where
he
was
on
that
evening
that
he
was
out
with
a
girl
or
that
he
was
out
with
somebody
else
or
that
he
had
gone
to
another
town.
they
kept
checking
what
he
told
them
and
they
stayed
--
he
stayed
at
the
police
station
until
2
o’clock
that
morning
and
at
10
--
about
9
o’clock
that
evening,
the
sergeant
came
down
from
concorde
and
talked
to
the
captain
in
charged
of
the
police
station
and
he
and
another
police
officer,
not
the
first
two
that
were
there
on
the
28th,
went
out
to
the
“petitioner’s
home
to
talk
to
the
wife
to
verify
one
thing
about
the
larceny
that
he
had
told
them,”
namely
that
he
had
bought
a
washing
machine
and
secondlth
y
to
discuss
with
her
his
whereabouts
on
the
evening
of
the
murder,
january
13,
1964.
when
they
arrived
there,
the
mother
in
law,
the
petitionr’s
mother
was
there,
they
started
to
talk
to
the
petitioner’s
wife
and
the
mother-in0law
made
some
statements
and
the
testimony
is
that
she
left
at
their
request.
after
the
mother-in-law
left,
the
petitioner’s
wife
discussed
this
with
the
two
police
officers
who
were
there
namely
about
where
the
petitioner
had
been
on
that
evening.
they
told
her
that
they
were
conducting
a
general
investigation,
an
investigation
into
the
crime,
the
murder
and
at
this
point
also,
they
had
no
knowledge
of
what
weapons
he
had
shown
to
the
other
two
officers.
they
had
no
knowledge
of
what
particular
weapon
they
were
looking
for.
they
asked
her
and
told
the
petitioner’s
wife
that
they
were
examining
clothing
and
weapons,
she
volunteered
that
they
--
that
he
had
some
riffles
and
asked
if
they
would
like
to
see
them.
they
said
yes
and
she
went
into
the
bedroom
and
they
followed
her
then
she
said
i
believed
i
asked
them
if
they
wanted
the
guns.
in
other
words,
the
request
for
the
--
to
take
the
guns
did
not
initiate
with
the
police
officers,
it
initiated
with
the
petitioner’s
wife.
and
one
of
the
police
officers
said
no
and
the
other
one
said
we
might
as
well
take
them,
which
is
consistent
with
the
finding
of
the
court
that
they
did
not
at
that
point
know
what
they
were
looking
for.
as
it
turned
out
later
that
evening
and
she
brought
out
not
three
but
four
weapons,
one
of
which
turned
out
to
be
the
murder
weapon.
later
that
evening
at
the
police
station,
the
other
police
officer
who
had
been
down
at
the
ballistics
laboratory
returned
about
post
of
midnight
and
for
the
first
time,
at
the
time
when
they
already
have
these
four
weapons
at
the
police
station,
they
know
that
they’re
looking
for
a
22-caliber
mossberg
rifle
and
he
recognizes
that
there’s
one
on
the
bench
of
the
police
station.
the
evidence
was
that
the
petitioner
saw
his
cloths
and
his
guns
at
the
police
station
that
evening,
in
fact,
the
next
morning
offered
to
sell
one
of
the
guns
to
the
one
of
the
police
officers,
and
it’s
within
this
factual
background
that
the
petitioner
raises
the
question
of
a
search
and
seizure.
the
trial
court
ruled
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
upheld
the
ruling
that
there
was
under
these
facts
and
circumstances,
no
search
and
no
seizure.
there
was
no
quest.
they
did
not
go
throughout
the
house
looking
for
anything.
in
fact,
it
was
only
at
the
offer
of
the
wife
that
they
took
the
rifles
with
them
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
contention
of
the
respondent
here
is
that
there
was
no
search
and
seizure
and
if
that’s
the
case,
then
there’s
no
issue
for
this
court
to
pass
upon
and
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
should
be
upheld.
but
even
assuming
that
there
was
a
search
or
a
seizure,
under
the
law,
it’s
the
contention
of
the
respondent
here
that
a
wife
has
the
authority
to
consent
to
a
--
voluntarily
consent
to
a
search
and
seizure
of
her
home
that
she
has
lawful
control
in
the
possession
of
and
i
think
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
and
handed
them
over.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
the
fact
that
she
also
made
a
statement
that
evening
which
i
haven’t
referred
to
before
was,
it’s
in
the
evidence
that
we
have
nothing
to
hide
and
the
basis
of
that
statement
is
obviously
the
events
that
happened
four
days
earlier
where
when
two
other
police
officers
were
there,
the
petitioner
himself
brought
out
and
showed
them,
show
them
through
the
car
and
answered
all
their
questions
without
any
hesitation.
there
was
no
reason
for
her
not
to
believe
otherwise
that
that
in
fact
they
did
have
nothing
to
hide
and
under
those
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
he
was
not
arrested
until
three
weeks
later,
he
was
not
even
the
prime
suspect
in
the
case
at
that
time
because
the
police
had
nothing
to
go
at
that
point
other
than
the
fact
that
he
was
not
at
home
that
evening.
it
was
not
until
several
weeks
later
that
the
weapon
that
was
tested
that
was
obtained
that
evening
indicated
that
it
was
the
murder
weapon
that
indicated
to
the
police
that
he
was
the
perpetrator
of
this
crime.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
mr.
justice
white.
so
that
under
those
circumstances
we
say
that
there
was
no
search
and
seizure
and
there
is
no
issue.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
issues,
search
and
seizure
issues
which
have
been
raised
here
by
the
petitioner
turned
on
the
admissibility
of
--
or
rather
suggest
that
the
vehicle
which
belonged
to
the
petitioner
and
certain
vacuum
sweeping
is
taken
from
it
subsequent
to
the
time
it
came
into
the
custody
of
the
police
were
obtained
by
unlawful
means
because
of
the
issuance
of
an
invalid
search
warrant.
and
secondly,
that
certain
items
of
clothing
particularly
and
a
murder
weapon,
a
weapon
which
was
subsequently
testified
to
as
being
the
weapon
which
fired
a
fatal
bullets
was
obtained,
interrogation
of
his
rights
from
his
wife
at
the
time
when
he
was
not
present.
taking
the
first
issue
that
the
petitioner
raises,
we
suggest
that
the
petitioner
is
stressing
form
rather
than
substance.
the
basis
of
their
contention
is
that
the
search
warrants
were
invalid
because
they
were
not
issued
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
since
the
magistrate
so
to
speak
who
issued
the
warrants
was
the
attorney
general
who’s
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
then
and
subsequently
who
tried
the
case
to
the
jury.
and
the
real
issue
we
say
is,
were
the
petitioner’s
constitutional
rights
affected
or
denied
him
in
any
way
by
what
actually
happened
here,
taking,
looking
at
the
substance
of
what
happened,
the
trial
court
has
specifically
ruled
that
on
the
basis
of
the
following
facts,
any
magistrate,
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
would
have
found
probable
cause
and
would
have
issued
the
search
warrants
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
search
warrant,
the
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
police
officers
were
very
properly
under
the
circumstances
seeking
a
search
warrant
and
i’m
simply
stating
that
to
deny
the
substance
of
what
happened
here
and
say
that
the
search
warrants
were
illegally
issued
under
these
circumstances
would
be
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
this
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
say
he
was
neutral
in
fact,
yes
mr.
chief
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
which
were
presented
to
them
which
were
as
follows.
that
on
the
evening
of
the
murder,
the
petitioner
was
missing
from
his
home
from
5
to
11
pm,
the
time
of
death
was
fixed
at
about
9,
between
8
and
10
pm
that
evening,
at
the
time
of
death
at
rather
9:30
pm
that
evening,
the
petitioner
admitted
and
other
witness
testified
to
the
fact
that
his
vehicle,
his
1951
vehicle
was
on
the
highway
opposite
from
where
the
body
of
the
victim
was
discovered
eight
days
later,
plus
the
fact
that
he
tried
to
obtain
alibis
for
his
whereabouts
on
the
evening
of
the
13th
from
other
people
plus
the
fact
that
the
ballistics
indicated
that
his
weapon
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
no,
i
don’t
think
the
evidence
shows
that
he
knew
all
of
this
at
that
time,
this,
the
purpose
of
the
conference
was
to
acquaint
the
attorney
general
at
this
point
of
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
he
issued
the
arrest
warrant
and
four
search
warrants.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
no,
at
that
time,
all
the
facts
had
been
presented
to
him,
all
of
some
which
he
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
to
him,
some
of
which
he
knew
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
for
both
reasons
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
testimony
of
chief
macgraney
was
that
the
conference
was
called
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
everything
that
had
been
--
was
relevant
to
that
--
the
case
at
that
time.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
and
also
to
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
and
also
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
would
say
he
was
neutral
throughout
the
whole
thing
because
at
this
point,
when
all
of
this
according
to
chief
macgraney,
when
this
was
which
he
testified
to,
and
this
was
presented
to
him,
he
did
not
have
all
these
facts
before
him.
he
was
appointed
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
he
was
--
under
the
new
hampshire
law,
the
attorney
general
is
the
chief
prosecutor
and
in
that
capacity,
he
has
control
of
any
criminal
case
that
particularly
the
murder
case
that
comes
to
his
attention.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
can
accept
that
to
a
point
mr.
justice
marshall
but
not
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
point
is
that
in
this
case,
there
was
a
distinguishing
factor.
the
chief
prosecutor
also
held
a
commission
here
as
a
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
in
effect
he
was
also
a
judge,
yes
to
a
certain
extent,
to
the
extent
that
he
could
issue
a
search
warrant
lawfully
under
new
hampshire
law.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
new
hampshire
law
was
not
that
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
don’t
believe
that
that
would
be
proper
in
any
state
and
that
was
not
the
law
in
new
hampshire
but
it
was
the
law
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
could
issue
a
search
warrant
under
proper
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
did
say
that
a
justice
of
the
peace
could
do
so
and
in
fact,
many
justice
of
the
peace
who
are
not
even
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
don’t
quite
follow
the
questionnaire
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
that
nature,
no
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
when
he
signed
the
search
warrants
and
issued
them,
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
him
to
do
so
we
state
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
by
the
authority
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
he
applies
for
a
commission
and
it’s
issued
to
him
by
the
governor
and
the
governor’s
counsel
and
a
commission,
he
has
sworn
after
the
commission
has
issued
before
to
other
justices
of
the
peace
and
the
commission
constitutes
his
warrant
to
act
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
this
is
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
since
the
initiation
of
the
constitution
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
back
in
1700
something
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
not
the
attorney
general,
anyone
who
applies
for
a
commission
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
is
issued
a
warrant
by
--
a
commission
rather
by
the
governor
and
counsel.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
he
was
issued
a
commission.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
life
imprisonment
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i’m
not
sure
that
it
is
but
the
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
trial
justice
does
the
sentencing
in
a
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
in
a
capital
case,
it’s
up
to
the
jury
to
recommend
capital
punishment
or
not.
in
this
case
they
chose
not
to
recommend
it.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
there
has
been
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
by
the
trial
justice.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
i
was
going
to
get
to
that.
there
are
quite
a
few
justices
of
the
peace.
many
of
whom
who
are
not
even
members
of
the
bar.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
and
this
has
been
the
--
incidentally
the
practices
mr.
cox
pointed
out.
in
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
the
legislature
changed
the
law
and
now
search
warrants
may
be
only
issued
by
a
justice
of
a
district
or
a
municipal
court.
the
prior
practice
of
any
justice
of
the
peace
having
authority
to
issue
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
has
been
changed.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
hundreds,
literally
hundreds,
the
commission
is
a
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
wouldn’t
say
there
are
thousands,
i
would
say
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
population
is
about
700,000.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
and
i
can’t
really
answer
your
question
definite,
definite
till
it
say
that
there
are
--
maybe
thousands
but
it
is
a
great
number.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
every
--
practically,
every
real
estate
broker,
every
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
--
every
accountant,
everyone,
many
offices
in
which
legal,
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
every
lawyer,
every
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
every
legal
secretary
practically
are
all
justices
of
peace.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
has
happened
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
it
has
happened
in
the
past
on
many
occasions.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
it
never
has
been
raised
before
and
in
fact,
that
practice
amongst
the
police
which
has
changed
substantially
back
in
around
this
time
after
this
case
was
for
a
police
officer
to
go
to
a
fellow
police
officer
who
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
have
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
issued.
the
practice
in
new
hampshire
never
was
for
police
officers
to
go
to
a
magistrate,
hardly
ever
to
go
to
a
magistrate
of
a
district
court
and
have
it
issued.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
he
probably
was.
he
was
the
chief
of
police
of
the
largest
city.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
because
then
he
would
be
passing
judgment
on
himself
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
i
think
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
well,
the
point
was
that
the
attorney
general
didn’t
have
the
information,
the
chief
of
police
did.
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
further
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
under
the
search
warrants,
the
only
item
of
evidence
that
was
seized
was
the
1951
pontiac
and
there
is
some
question
about
whether
that
was
under
the
search
warrant.
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
automobile
of
the
petitioner.
at
the
time
that
they
arrested
him,
the
automobile
was
parked
in
its
driveway
and
the
police
arrested
him,
took
him
to
the
police
station,
called
a
tow
truck
and
the
tow
truck
took
an
hour
to
an
hour
and
half
to
get
there
then
that
the
vehicle
was
removed.
the
search
warrant
authorized
the
executing
officer
to
search
the
vehicle
but
it
did
not
specifically
identify
the
vehicle
as
an
item
to
be
seized.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes,
i
think
that
on
several
independent
grounds
on
probable
cause
alone
which
i’ve
outlined
on
the
seizure
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
arrest
warrant
was
ever
challenged
here
but
maybe
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
only
that
it
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
and
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
under
the
statute
as
i
recall
it,
the
rsa
595,
one
of
the
section
enumerates
the
items
which
maybe
specifically
seized
and
the
fourth
or
fifth
one
is
a
general
one
which
dates
on
anything
connected
to
the
crime
for
which
the
respondent
is
arrested.
so,
under
that
particular
category
of
the
statute,
i
would
answer
your
question
yes,
it
would
be
something
that
could
be
seized
since
it
was
an
item
of
evidence
pertaining
directly
to
the
crime
for
which
he
was
arrested.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
that
is
what
in
controversy
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
vacuum
sweepings
were
examined
by
experts
and
the
--
they
were
segregated
under
a
microscope
and
also
items,
similar
items
were
taken
from
the
clothing
of
the
victim
and
compared
by
the
expert
and
on
probabilities,
he
testified
that
these
particular
particles
probably
had
a
common
source,
this
was
the
summoned
substance
of
the
evidence
on
that
point.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
no,
they
were
mostly
plastics,
paints,
metals,
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
date
of
the
conviction
was
june
of
1965
your
honor,
thank
you,
a
year
after
--
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
crime
took
place.
to
summarize
the
first
point,
we
simply
contend
that
on
a
substance
of
what
happened
here,
there
was
probable
cause,
the
trial
court
found
that
any
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
would
have
found
probable
cause
and
the
way
we
read
the
aguilar
case,
the
giordenello
and
the
other
cases
is
that
all
--
this
is
all
that
the
constitution
requires
is
that
on
the
basis
of
adequate
facts
presented
to
a
magistrate
who
was
in
fact
neutral
and
detached,
these
the
finding
of
the
search
warrants
are
issued.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
the
next
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
has
to
do
with
certain
items
of
clothing
and
the
murder
weapon
which
was
obtained
by
the
police
from
the
wife
on
the
date
of
february
2,
1964.
i
would
like
to
just
go
over
the
facts
briefly
with
respect
to
how
these
items
were
obtained
because
i
think
it’s
very
crucial
to
sustain
the
--
to
explain
rather
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
there
in
fact
was
no
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
murder
weapon
and
the
clothes.
as
mr.
cox
pointed
out,
on
january
the
28th,
when
the
police
were
conducting
a
very
general
investigation,
not
knowing
who
they
were
looking
for
or
even
what
they
were
looking
for
in
terms
of
a
murder
weapon
and
based
on
the
report
only
of
a
neighbor
that
this
particular
individual,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
not
at
home
on
that
evening
between
5
and
11
o’clock,
they
went
to
his
home
and
asked
him
about
where
he
was
that
evening,
during
the
course
of
this
visit,
he
freely
discussed
his
activities
on
that
evening.
during
the
course
of
this
visit,
he
took
them
out
and
showed
them
his
cars
and
he
brought
out
three
weapons
to
show
them.
the
police
officers
who
were
there
listed
the
three
weapons
and
neither
of
these
weapons
was
the
murder
weapon.
while
they
were
there,
they
asked
him
he
would
mind
taking
a
lie
detector
test
and
he
said
no
but
he
was
a
bakery
truck
driver
and
could
not
get
off
except
on
a
sunday
so
could
it
be
on
a
sunday.
and
they
set
a
date
for
the
following
sunday
which
is
february
the
2nd.
on
february
2,
one
of
the
officers
that
was
there
called
him
and
he
came
down
to
the
station
voluntarily,
they
stayed
at
the
station,
this
is
at
1
o’clock
in
the
afternoon,
they
stayed
till
about
3
to
3:30
talking
about
whether
he
should
take
a
test
or
not
and
finally,
he
agreed
to
go
with
them
to
state
police
headquarters
in
concorde.
before
or
rather
during
the
test,
there,
they
turned
them
over
to
sergeant
macbane
at
that
time
with
the
state
police
who
administered
the
lie
detector
test
which
was
inconclusive
but
in
the
course
of
administering
the
test,
the
petitioner
admitted
a
larceny
of
$300.00
from
his
employer.
the
police
then
took
the
petitioner
back
to
manchester
and
since
he
had
been
giving
him
conflicting
stories
about
where
he
was
on
that
evening
that
he
was
out
with
a
girl
or
that
he
was
out
with
somebody
else
or
that
he
had
gone
to
another
town.
they
kept
checking
what
he
told
them
and
they
stayed
--
he
stayed
at
the
police
station
until
2
o’clock
that
morning
and
at
10
--
about
9
o’clock
that
evening,
the
sergeant
came
down
from
concorde
and
talked
to
the
captain
in
charged
of
the
police
station
and
he
and
another
police
officer,
not
the
first
two
that
were
there
on
the
28th,
went
out
to
the
“petitioner’s
home
to
talk
to
the
wife
to
verify
one
thing
about
the
larceny
that
he
had
told
them,”
namely
that
he
had
bought
a
washing
machine
and
secondlth
y
to
discuss
with
her
his
whereabouts
on
the
evening
of
the
murder,
january
13,
1964.
when
they
arrived
there,
the
mother
in
law,
the
petitionr’s
mother
was
there,
they
started
to
talk
to
the
petitioner’s
wife
and
the
mother-in0law
made
some
statements
and
the
testimony
is
that
she
left
at
their
request.
after
the
mother-in-law
left,
the
petitioner’s
wife
discussed
this
with
the
two
police
officers
who
were
there
namely
about
where
the
petitioner
had
been
on
that
evening.
they
told
her
that
they
were
conducting
a
general
investigation,
an
investigation
into
the
crime,
the
murder
and
at
this
point
also,
they
had
no
knowledge
of
what
weapons
he
had
shown
to
the
other
two
officers.
they
had
no
knowledge
of
what
particular
weapon
they
were
looking
for.
they
asked
her
and
told
the
petitioner’s
wife
that
they
were
examining
clothing
and
weapons,
she
volunteered
that
they
--
that
he
had
some
riffles
and
asked
if
they
would
like
to
see
them.
they
said
yes
and
she
went
into
the
bedroom
and
they
followed
her
then
she
said
i
believed
i
asked
them
if
they
wanted
the
guns.
in
other
words,
the
request
for
the
--
to
take
the
guns
did
not
initiate
with
the
police
officers,
it
initiated
with
the
petitioner’s
wife.
and
one
of
the
police
officers
said
no
and
the
other
one
said
we
might
as
well
take
them,
which
is
consistent
with
the
finding
of
the
court
that
they
did
not
at
that
point
know
what
they
were
looking
for.
as
it
turned
out
later
that
evening
and
she
brought
out
not
three
but
four
weapons,
one
of
which
turned
out
to
be
the
murder
weapon.
later
that
evening
at
the
police
station,
the
other
police
officer
who
had
been
down
at
the
ballistics
laboratory
returned
about
post
of
midnight
and
for
the
first
time,
at
the
time
when
they
already
have
these
four
weapons
at
the
police
station,
they
know
that
they’re
looking
for
a
22-caliber
mossberg
rifle
and
he
recognizes
that
there’s
one
on
the
bench
of
the
police
station.
the
evidence
was
that
the
petitioner
saw
his
cloths
and
his
guns
at
the
police
station
that
evening,
in
fact,
the
next
morning
offered
to
sell
one
of
the
guns
to
the
one
of
the
police
officers,
and
it’s
within
this
factual
background
that
the
petitioner
raises
the
question
of
a
search
and
seizure.
the
trial
court
ruled
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
upheld
the
ruling
that
there
was
under
these
facts
and
circumstances,
no
search
and
no
seizure.
there
was
no
quest.
they
did
not
go
throughout
the
house
looking
for
anything.
in
fact,
it
was
only
at
the
offer
of
the
wife
that
they
took
the
rifles
with
them
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
contention
of
the
respondent
here
is
that
there
was
no
search
and
seizure
and
if
that’s
the
case,
then
there’s
no
issue
for
this
court
to
pass
upon
and
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
should
be
upheld.
but
even
assuming
that
there
was
a
search
or
a
seizure,
under
the
law,
it’s
the
contention
of
the
respondent
here
that
a
wife
has
the
authority
to
consent
to
a
--
voluntarily
consent
to
a
search
and
seizure
of
her
home
that
she
has
lawful
control
in
the
possession
of
and
i
think
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
and
handed
them
over.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
the
fact
that
she
also
made
a
statement
that
evening
which
i
haven’t
referred
to
before
was,
it’s
in
the
evidence
that
we
have
nothing
to
hide
and
the
basis
of
that
statement
is
obviously
the
events
that
happened
four
days
earlier
where
when
two
other
police
officers
were
there,
the
petitioner
himself
brought
out
and
showed
them,
show
them
through
the
car
and
answered
all
their
questions
without
any
hesitation.
there
was
no
reason
for
her
not
to
believe
otherwise
that
that
in
fact
they
did
have
nothing
to
hide
and
under
those
--
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
he
was
not
arrested
until
three
weeks
later,
he
was
not
even
the
prime
suspect
in
the
case
at
that
time
because
the
police
had
nothing
to
go
at
that
point
other
than
the
fact
that
he
was
not
at
home
that
evening.
it
was
not
until
several
weeks
later
that
the
weapon
that
was
tested
that
was
obtained
that
evening
indicated
that
it
was
the
murder
weapon
that
indicated
to
the
police
that
he
was
the
perpetrator
of
this
crime.
mr.
alexander
j.
kalinski
yes
mr.
justice
white.
so
that
under
those
circumstances
we
say
that
there
was
no
search
and
seizure
and
there
is
no
issue.
