justice
potter
stewart
both
branches
of
your
argument,
your
entire
argument
of
course
in
this
case
depends
upon
the
continuing
validity
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
the
attorney
general
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
filed
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
--
do
you
challenge
the
existence
of
probable
cause
for
the
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
and
would
you
say
that
the
invalid
warrant
would
have
prevented
the
police
who
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
pontiac
that
the
invalid
warrant
would
have
prevented
him
from
searching
it
if
they
had
found
it
in
motion
on
the
highway?
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
basis
do
you
say
it’s
not
about
to
be
in
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
but
i
suppose
other
people
in
his
family
had
access
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
of
course
he
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
stop
the
car,
mr.
cox
when
you
stop
the
car
on
the
highway
after
it’s
in
motion
where
you
can
always
immobilize
it
and
wait
for
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
car
itself
was
in
one
of
these
search
warrants?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
affidavit?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
you’ve
already
been
in
the
record,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
know
about
how
many
justices
of
the
peace
are
there
in
new
hampshire?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
about
how
many
are
there?
i
didn’t
get
that
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
thousands,
literally
thousands,
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
population
of
the
state
is
about
half
million?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
has
grown
greater.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
familiar
only
with
a
little
area
up
there
quite
closely
familiar
with
that
of
a
few
hundred
people
and
i’m
sure
there
are
dozens
of
justice
of
peace
--
justices
of
the
peace
among
those
areas.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
most
legal
secretaries.
justice
potter
stewart
and
most
real
estate
agents?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
all
had
--
at
the
time
of
this
search,
they
all
have
power
to
issue
search
warrants.
justice
potter
stewart
now
we
could
get
it
the
other
way,
the
attorney
general
could
have
made
out
the
affidavit,
he
could
have
issued
the
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
possible
that
these
both
had
the
same
information.
