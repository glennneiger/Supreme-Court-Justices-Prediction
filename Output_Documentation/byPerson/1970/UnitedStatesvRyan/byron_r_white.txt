the
issue
here
is
appealability?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
whether
the
order
was
valid
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
any
--
in
an
ordinary
civil
case,
any
order
for
inspection
and
copying
of
records
or
an
order
for
a
physical
examination,
for
example,
would
be
appealable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
be
an
order,
an
affirmative
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn’t
that
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
there
is
nothing
that
is
more
of
a
specific
order
to
a
specific
individual
than
to
submit
to
a
physical
examination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
only
--
that
there
wouldn’t
be
any
possibility
of
contempt,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
were,
appealable?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
does
subpoena
mean?
doesn’t
the
subpoena
pretty
well
command
somebody
to
do
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you’re
subject
to
a
contempt
order,
if
you
disobey
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what’s
the
difference
between
a
subpoena
and
an
order
--
an
ordinary
subpoena
and
what
happened
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
whether
it
commands
certain
affirmative
acts
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it’s
a
civil
litigation,
if
the
government
had
applied
to
inspect
and
copy
records
in
kenya,
and
the
court
had
ordered
mr.
ryan
to
turn
them
over
for
inspection

there
would

been

it
would
not

mr.

let’s
assume
that
in
a
criminal
case,
the
government
subpoenas
a
witness
not
a
party.

subpoenas
a
witness

for

for
the

isn’t
there
a
procedure
for
producing
records
at
a
specific
location
and
permitting
inspection
and
copying?

16?

byron

justice

would
that
kind
of
a
refusal
to
quash
that
kind
of
a
subpoena
which
would
demand
the
inspection
and
copying
or
permitted
inspection
and
copying,
would
that
be
appealable?
justice
byron

well,
i
suppose
the
defendant
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case
would
make
the
government
produce
for
inspection
and
copying
certain
documents?
justice
byron
r.

under

justice
byron

and
the

will
