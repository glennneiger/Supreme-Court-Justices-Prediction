mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subpoena
which
was
served
on
raymond
ryan
on
march
5,
1968
required
the
production
of
records,
corporate
records
covering
a
period
of
30
years,
required
the
production
of
these
records
even
though
they
were
kenya
corporations
and
all
of
the
records
subpoenaed
were
in
fact
located
in
kenya.
upon
receiving
the
subpoena,
ryan
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
mcflow
and
bryant
out
of
respect
whether
tribunal
seeking
the
records
filed
a
motion
to
quash
based
on
several
grounds
including
oppressiveness,
a
violation
of
the
law
of
kenya.
i
submit
that
petitioners
in
later
proceedings,
if
this
is
not
considered
an
appealable
order
would
be
well
advised
when
being
served
with
the
grand
jury
subpoena
not
to
file
a
motion
to
quash
and
not
to
obtain
an
interlocutory
ruling
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
compliance.
the
reason
is
very
simple.
that
had
this
subpoena
merely
been
ignored,
there
is
no
question
in
anyone’s
mind
to
just
look
at
it
that
this
subpoena
would
in
fact
have
been
void
and
invalid,
if
not
for
being
oppressive,
and
requiring
the
transportation
of
records
10,000
miles
into
the
united
states
because
the
subpoena
itself
did
in
fact
violate
the
law
of
kenya.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
pleases,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
order
of
july
25,
1968
issued
by
judge
manuel
real
of
the
district
court
of
california
requiring
respondent
ryan
to
travel
to
kenya
and
produce
2,000
pounds
of
records
at
his
own
expense
covering
a
30
year
period
was
an
appealable
order.
and
they
further
said
that,
it
was
appealable
because
it
was
a
mandatory
injunction
requiring
mr.
ryan
in
effect
to
sue
and
libel,
to
act
as
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury
to
travel
20,000
miles,
to
make
application
to
officials
of
a
foreign
country,
to
attend
and
superintend
the
packing,
the
crating
and
the
shipping
of
some
2000
pounds
of
records
to
the
united
states.
and
if
he
does
not,
if
he
was
unable
to
obtain
the
permission
of
the
kenya
officials
then
he
was
required
to
make
those
records
available
for
copying
and
i
quote,
“agents
of
the
department
of
justice
and/or
the
treasury
department.”
there
is
no
limitation
in
that
order
of
july
25,
1968
that
these
records
are
to
be
treated
as
though
they
were
subpoenaed
by
a
grand
jury,
that
they
are
under
the
secrecy
provisions
of
6
(e)
of
the
criminal
rules
as
required
by
the
grand
jury
and
in
fact,
there
was
no
limitation
on
what
right
the
government
had
with
respect
to
those
records.
they
could
publish
them
in
a
newspaper.
they
could
use
them
for
a
civil
proceeding.
they
could
use
them
for
any
purpose
even
though
ostensibly
this
proceeding
began
as
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
order
that
we’re
talking
about
and
the
subpoena,
the
district
court
himself
made
it
abundantly
clear
on
several
occasions.
he
said,
“it
is
not
the
subpoena
that
is
the
subject
of
the
contempt
charge.
it
is
not
the
subpoena
that
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
the
court’s
order
of
july
25,
1968.
it
is
the
court’s
order
that
mr.
ryan
has
to
comply
with.
it
is
the
court’s
order
that
mr.
ryan
is
in
contempt
of.
it
is
the
court’s
order
that
the
order
to
show
cause
was
directed
against
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
ryan
had
in
fact
violated
anything
issued
by
the
court.”
and
the
court
also
stated
in
a
colloquy
that
the
order
itself
of
july
25
was
like
a
civil
injunction.
therefore,
once
the
civil
injunction
was
entered,
compliance
must
be
had.
failure
to
comply
would
result
--
failure
to
comply
would
result
in
a
finding
of
contempt
and
the
findings
and
the
legal
issues
could
not
be
re-litigated
at
the
contempt
hearing.
thus,
the
--
i
know
it
and
incidentally,
i
know
that
the
government
argued
that
the
finding
and
the
various
legal
issues
would
reviewed
upon
--
reviewable
upon
appeal
if
ryan
had
in
fact
been
held
guilty
of
contempt
and
yet
there
is
respectable
which
looks
to
the
contrary
and
it
has
been
decided
by
this
court.
it
says,
when
a
civil
injunction
has
been
entered
as
here
and
there
is
a
failure
to
comply
that
then
becomes
a
contempt
and
you
may
not
re-litigate
the
factual
or
the
legal
basis
of
that
order
even
though
it
may
have
the
order
may
be
reversed
on
appeal
or
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
is
--
it
goes
far
beyond
the
capability
of
any
subpoena
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
experience
at
the
bar.
i
have
--
in
the
first
place,
it
is
an
order
requiring
a
man
to
make
an
application
to
a
high
official
of
a
foreign
government.
that’s
the
first
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no
sir,
it
does
not.
because
what
the
subpoena
says,
is
that
you
produce
the
records.
ryan,
if
he
had
custody
and
control
could
produce
the
record
or
where
it's
not
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
i
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
would
have
to
take
those
steps
that
were
within
his
power.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
order
itself.
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
order
went
far
beyond
any
legitimate
requirement
that
can
be
imposed
by
a
subpoena.
now,
if
i
may,
one,
i
do
not
believe
that
any
district
court
or
a
grand
jury
or
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury
has
the
authority
to
issue
a
subpoena
without
prepayment
of
cause
which
requires
an
individual
to
travel
10,000
miles
over
to
a
foreign
country
and
return
10,000
miles
back
carrying
with
him
2,000
pounds
of
records
for
getting
the
application
to
the
foreign
government
for
the
time
being.
i
don’t
believe
that
there
is
that
authority.
i
know
off
no
case
and
we
challenge
the
government
to
supply
us
with
any
case
in
which
that
was
in
fact
a
requirement
of
a
subpoena,
and
they
have
come
forth
with
none.
and
thus,
if
the
court
please,
equating
the
order
and
subpoena
together,
i
think
the
subpoena
goes
far
beyond
any
right
that
a
grand
jury
have
to
force
an
individual
to
sue
in
labor
as
would
be
required
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
to
forth
with
as
the
order
required,
leave,
drop
that
everything
the
citizen
is
doing,
drop
everything
the
citizen
is
doing,
go
to
a
foreign
country
10,000
miles,
25
hours
of
air
flight
to
get
to
kenya,
25
hours,
obtain
the
records,
freight
them
up,
bear
the
responsibility
of
bringing
them
back
to
the
southern
or
the
central
district
of
california
and
to
do
this
without
any
prepayment
of
expenses.
any
offer
of
round
trip
payment
of
the
aircraft
--
fare.
in
other
words,
if
ryan
were
person
an
abject
poverty,
there
isn’t
a
court
in
this
land
that
would
permit
such
a
thing
to
happen.
but
because
he
is
supposedly
a
man
of
some
means,
then
it’s
alright
that
he
has
to
spend
his
money,
thousands
of
dollars
required
for
air
fare,
the
thousands
of
dollars
to
hold
2000
pounds
of
record
back
to
the
united
states.
that
is
what
the
grand
jury
subpoena
required
and
that
is
what
the
july
25
order
requires.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
it
could
not
be
done
by
a
surface
travel,
i
don’t
believe.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
are
no
findings,
there
are
no
findings.
the
only
finding
in
this
record,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
ryan
at
times
before
and
after
the
commencement
of
the
government
investigation
had
custody
and
control
of
these
records.
and
i
submit
if
the
court
please,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
irs
investigations
commenced
in
1964.
so
what
the
finding
is
that
in
sometime
before
and
after
1964,
he
had
custody
and
control
of
the
record.
of
course,
i
challenged
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
didn’t
get
it
to
it.
but
if
i
could
address
myself
to
the
appealability
factor
here
because
i
think
it
bears
very
much
on
the
type
of
conduct
required
here.
i
would
be
concerned
if
this
court
or
if
the
court
of
appeals
have
no
supervisory
power
over
the
utilization
of
subpoena
to
require
an
individual,
for
example,
to
go
into
an
fbi
office
and
give
a
voice
exemplar.
the
grand
jury
subpoena
requiring
that,
so
that
his
voice
exemplar
might
be
compared
with
an
intercepted
telephone
conversation
to
see
whether
he
was
in
fact
the
individual.
i
think
we
are
entering
into
the
period
when
the
grand
jury
is
moving
from
its
original
purpose
and
moving
out
now
into
a
position
where
it
is
being
used
more
and
more
as
an
investigative
body
rather
than
merely
a
body
to
consider
whether
or
not
there
has
been
violation
of
crime.
and
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
you
--
that
this
order
and
this
subpoena
here
is
broader
than
anything
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
experience,
in
terms
of
requiring
an
individual
citizen
to
sue,
to
labor,
to
act
as
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury,
and
in
effect
to
investigate
for
the
grand
jury.
and
i
submit
that
the
subpoena
power
does
not
permit
that
and
i
submit
that
the
order
itself
that
the
court
could
not
in
fact
enter
an
order
of
this
nature.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
either
goes
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
orders
--
that
the
records
available
in
kenya
make
to
be
made
available
in
kenya,
be
returned
to
the
grand
jury
or
the
copies
be
returned
to
the
grand
jury.
all
it
was
that
the
record
be
turned
over
to
agents
of
the
department
of
justice
or
the
treasury
department
for
copying
and
this,
i
submit,
went
far
beyond
any
subpoena
requirements
that
could
come
out
of
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
grand
jury
subpoena
requires
those
records
be
submitted
to
the
grand
jury
and
produce
there.
this
order
did
not
require
that.
it
went
far
beyond
what
was
required.
the
--
on
the
issue
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
on
the
contrary,
it
would
not
be
appealable.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
would
be
an
affirmative
order
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
is
because
it
is
in
the
nature
of
an
order
entered
in
the
course
of
civil
litigation
and
the
requirements
there
are
that
the
way
the
order
is
enforced
is
that
the
pleadings
of
the
party
be
stricken
or
that
some
other
action
be
taken
with
respect
to
the
litigant
as
distinguished
from
here
where
you
have
an
order
directed
to
a
particular
individual.
i
would
submit,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
would
--
i
would
submit
if
that
order
were
directed
to
the
plaintiff
in
a
case,
and
if
he
refused
that
under
the
practice
certainly
of
the
federal
rules
that
that
individual
will
just
have
complaint
stricken.
that
they
would
not
--
it
would
not
be
treated
in
effect
as
mandatory
injunction
that
he
be
required
to
comply
with
the
physical
examination.
but
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
order
could
be
so
phrased
whereby
it
could
be
contempt
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
it
were
and
if
it
were
a
mandatory,
if
the
court
specifically
said,
as
was
in
this
case,
that
you
shall
forth
with
take
yourself
to
a
doctor’s
office
and
then
right
then,
under
those
circumstances
comparable
to
your
issue
here,
i
think,
you
would
have
a
question
of
an
appealability.
and
the
reason
is,
if
the
court
please,
congress
itself
which
has
established
the
appellate
jurisdiction
has
said,
that
certain
interlocutory
decisions
are
appealed,
that’s
1292.
now,
the
interlocutory
decisions
granting
an
injunction
or
a
mandatory
injunction
are
held
according
the
congress
requirement
then
may
be
appealable.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
heard
much
of
the
cobbledick
case
and
there,
you
did
not
have
any
aspects
of
an
injunction
or
a
mandatory
requirement
than
an
individual
to
take
action.
there,
all
you
had
was
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
quash
a
grand
jury
subpoena
and
the
decision
of
this
court
was
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
that
was
a
final
order,
whether
it
was
a
final
order
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1291.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mbecause,
if
the
court
please,
the
man
was
under
no
requirement
to
turn
records
over
for
copying,
for
example,
in
kenya.
there
was
no
requirement
in
that
subpoena
to
(inaudible)
for
copying
by
any
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
or
the
treasury
department.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
depending
on
the
type
of
order
and
depending
on
the
framework,
for
example,
if
it
were
in
fact
an
independent
action.
suppose
the
government
in
this
case,
instead
of
going
to
the
grand
jury
decided
to
apply
for
letters
rogatory.
then,
i
can
see
that
there
would
in
fact
when
the
letters
rogatory
had
been
entered
in
the
requirements
made
then
i
can
see
that
you
would,
in
fact,
have
a
final
order
that
would
perhaps
fall
under
the
provisions
of
1291
and
would
be
infield
because
then
you’ll
get
into
the
question
of
what
is
this
in
fact
such
an
independent
proceeding
as
will
support
an
appeal.
now
here
on
the
contrary,
you
have
the
different
situation
where
you
have
a
court
order
compelling
conduct
that
is
not
in
fact
required
by
the
original
subpoena
and
in
fact,
could
not
be
required
by
the
original
subpoena.
and
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
once
that
happens
you
go
far
beyond
any
requirements
of
merely
complying
with
the
subpoena
or
not,
you
have
moved
out
into
a
separate
independent
proceeding
where
an
individual
at
his
own
expense
has
to
fly
20,000
miles
to
get
2,000
pounds
of
records
and
bring
them
back
or
make
them
available
to
the
people
in
a
foreign
land.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
fact
that
he
was
in
kenya
was
in
fact
his
own
thing
to
be
sure,
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
imposition,
sir,
is
that
he
is
required
“forthwith”
to
make
application
and
to
do
the
things
required
in
the
order.
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
in
kenya
or
had
been
to
kenya,
i
do
not
think
makes
any
more
less
onerous
the
fact
that
he
is
required
to
produce
these
corporate
documents
from
kenya
and
plant
them
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir,
i
believe
it
goes
far
beyond
the
original
subpoena
because
it
does
what
the
subpoena
could
not
do.
it
requires
these
records
be
made
available
to
any
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
or
the
internal
revenue
service,
without
restriction.
and
the
court
of
appeals
years
ago
in
in
re
grand
jury,
229
f2nd
said
you
cannot
utilize
the
grand
jury
subpoena
in
that
matter,
it’s
improper.
that’s
been
the
law
for
years
and
that
is
where
this
order
has
gone
far
beyond,
what
a
subpoena
could
in
fact
do.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
further,
that
the
--
on
the
question
of
custody
and
control.
there
is
no
finding
that
ryan
was
in
fact,
the
director
of
these
companies
nor
could,
in
fact,
there
be
such
a
finding.
and
absent
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
finding,
it
is
a
violation
of
kenya
law
for
him
to
attempt
to
make
certain
of
these
records,
namely
the
books
of
account
available
even
in
kenya
for
copying.
and
this
argument
is
set
forth
in
extensive
in
the
brief
which
we
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
pages
22,
23,
and
24,
which
i
think
clearly
demonstrates
that
even
this
order
as
currently
drafted
violates
the
laws
of
kenya.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
is
under
rule
17.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
rule
17.
well,
rule
16
applies
to
certain
statements
and
document,
but
rule
17
submits
the
court
to
--
when
a
subpoenas
been
issued
to
require
the
records
be
produced
in
advance
of
trial
at
a
specific
date
and
time,
but
that
is
not
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
it
would
because
it
is
unlike
the
case
here
where
the
grand
jury
subpoena
subject
to
the
strictures
of
6
(e)
has
been
totally
violated
by
the
order
of
july
25
which
requires
the
records
be
made
available
to
either
treasury
or
department
of
justice
agents.
no
limitations,
no
requirement
the
record
to
be
produced
before
the
grand
jury
at
a
date
certain.
no
requirements
that
these
records
be
kept
in
camera
and
subject
to
the
rules
of
6
(e)
as
required
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
that
this
order
goes
far
beyond
what
is
compellable
by
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
mostly
to
it.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no.
it
is
not
appealable
mr.
justice
white,
for
the
simple
reason,
it
is
part
of
the
matters
proceeding
to
a
hearing.
this
case
was
not
that.
this
is
turned
into
a
completely
separate,
independent
action
to
compel
this
individual
to
produce
records.
i
would
like
to
refer
also
to
the
fact
that
when
we’re
talking
about
the
offer
of
the
federal
government
to
make
these
records
available
in
kenya
as
the
government
has
suggested,
that
offer
was
only
if
ryan
would
state,
would
authenticate
the
records.
the
trial
court
was
informed
he
could
not
authenticate
those
records
and
consequently
the
court
said,
“well
alright,
we
will
proceed
to
enter
the
order
that
we
have.”
the
--
getting
back
to
the
question
of
appealability.
under
cobbledick,
the
sole
question
was
one
of
finality
under
section
1291.
that
is
not
this
case.
that
was
solely
a
motion,
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
quash
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
this
was
not
that.
this
was
an
order
which
directed
an
individual
forthwith
to
make
application
to
a
foreign
official,
to
be
in
charge
of
bringing
back
2,000
pounds
of
records
located
10,000
miles
away
and
to
do
so
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
subpoena
would
by
implication
require
to
do
that
except,
if
the
court
please,
the
subpoena
would
not,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
apply
to
the
requirements
that
these
records
be
made
available
to
other
people.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
if
there
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
this.
i’m
saying
that
the
subpoena
is
oppressive,
i
want
the
court
very
clear
on
that,
i
was
trying
to
make
what
i
thought
was
the
distinction
between
what
the
subpoena
could
require
and
what
the
order
did
in
fact
required.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
--
in
effect,
the
subpoena
would
require
that
type
of
action
to
be
taken
except
that
the
--
when
a
subpoena
is
served,
you
have
to
use
what
capabilities
you
have
to
produce
the
records,
granted.
i
say,
that
this
order
went
far
beyond
the
subpoena
because
the
subpoena
did
not
even
by
implication
require
an
application
be
made
to
a
foreign
official
of
kenya.
now
if
in
fact,
ryan
had
to
do
this
to
get
the
records,
he
might
have
made
that
application.
he
might
have
been
required
to
make
that
application
but
this
order
made
it
specific.
furthermore,
he
was
required
to
turn
the
records
over.
he
was
tried
forthwith
to
make
that
implication.
there
was
no
time
schedule
involved.
furthermore,
he
was
required
to
bring
the
records
from
kenya
and
be
in
charge
of
those
records
to
the
court
in
los
angeles.
now,
granted
the
subpoena
would
requires
the
--
require
latter
part
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
that
even
though
the
subpoena
requirement,
this
subpoena
it
goes
far
beyond
any
that
i’ve
ever
seen
in
my
experience
and
i
wager
as
i
said
before,
we
try
as
challenged
the
government
to
show
us
a
comparable
expression
or
requirement
of
any
subpoena
or
court
order
to
produce
documents
and
they
came
up
with
exactly
no
cases
as
i
knew
they
would.
where
other
cases
have
indicated
that
if
subpoena
cannot
compel
an
individual
to
sue
and
labor,
to
act
as
an
agent
to
obtain
records,
to
get
records,
to
get
something
that
he
cannot,
does
not
have
right
at
that
available
time.
the
monroe
case
was
cited,
in
fact,
justice
frankfurter’s
comments
in
the
dissent
in
the
placement
case.
all
point
to
the
direction
i’m
saying,
that
you
cannot
use
the
grand
jury
or
its
subpoena
power
or
an
order,
a
separate
order
which
may
have
been
an
outgrowth
to
the
grand
jury
subpoena
to
require
an
individual
to
do
the
things
which
were
required
here
either
by
the
order
or
the
subpoena.
and
then
to
say
that
if
he
doesn’t
do
it,
then
he
is
guilty
of
contempt
and
has
no
chance
to
even
litigate
those
factual
issues
at
the
time
of
the
contempt
here.
as
the
court,
i’m
sure
is
aware
under
maggie
versus
zais
in
bankruptcy
turnover
orders
where
the
courts
have
those
years,
entered
an
order
saying,
“you
turn
over
these
records
or
these
assets.”
that
order
is
forthwith
and
immediately
appealable
and
then
when
the
case
goes
back
down,
the
findings
involved
in
that
case
are
not
re-litigated
at
the
trial
court
level.
they
are
considered
res
judicata
and
the
government
has
tried
to
put
ryan
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i'm
certain,
absolutely
not.
the
--
we
challenge
and
have
below,
the
finding
that
he
had
custody
and
control
of
these
records.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
are
--
well,
there
are
probably
records
there
but
he
doesn’t
have
any
control
over
those
records.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
it
is,
if
the
court
please,
we
filed
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
filed
a
motion
to
quash
and
submitted
an
affidavit
from
people
in
kenya
which
established
this
fact
and
the
court
ruled
to
the
contrary.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
certainly
do
and
i
submit
to
the
court,
he
could
not
do
so.
in
fact,
he
filed
an
affidavit
with
the
internal
revenue
service
two
years
before
the
subpoena
in
service
and
the
subpoena
in
question
was
served,
filed
an
affidavit
in
october
or
november
1968.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
couldn’t
agree
with
the
court
more
and
i
did
make
a
motion
to
quash
based
on
that.
and
of
course,
all
of
my
evidence,
i
had
to
get
in
affidavit
form
because
all
of
the
witnesses
were
in
fact
in
kenya.
and
i
filed
my
affidavits
and
the
court
--
and
the
government
filed
other
affidavits.
and
the
court
read
the
affidavits
and
says,
“i
find
that
at
times
before
and
after
the
commencement
of
the
investigation
of
mr.
ryan
by
the
federal
government,
he
had
control
of
these
documents.
and
of
course,
i
challenge
that
and
i
think
it’s
wholly
wrong
but
now,
what
happens.
so
now
if
there’s
an
order
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt
and
the
trial
court
is
saying,
“ah,
you
cannot
re-litigate
the
question
of
custody
and
control.”
the
only
thing
that
this
contempt
trial
is
going
to
be
the
government
is
not
going
to
have
to
prove
that
he
was
guilty
of
contempt
beyond
reasonable
doubt
or
had
custody
and
control
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
government,
all
they’re
going
to
have
to
show
is
that
he
had
the
capability
to
produce
the
records
on
july
25
whether
he
had
not
done
something
to
turn
it
over
and
that,
if
the
court
please,
demonstrates
the
terrible
dilemma
in
which
one
is
placed
by
filing
a
motion
to
quash.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
--
yes,
if
the
court
please,
could
be
reviewed
on
appeal.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
submit,
they
may
say
that
to
this
court
here
but
there
is
very
substantial
body
of
case
law
which
would
indicate
that
it
cannot
be
reviewed
on
appeal.
now,
whether
the
commitment
here
would
permit
us
to
raise
it
on
appeal
but
even
on
appeal,
if
the
court
please,
that’s
not
sufficient
for
my
client,
because
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
litigate
that
at
the
trial
level.
i
mean,
finding
a
man
in
contempt
is
a
very
serious
procedure.
and
the
fact
that
he
had
now
is
faced
with
the
argument
that
this
res
judicata,
i
mean,
it
will
be
held
in
contempt
on
that
issue
because
he
can’t
even
re-litigate
it
and
i
just
don’t
think
that
this
is
a
fair
or
proper
type
of
proceeding.
the
government
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
they
can’t
say
that
this
is
res
judicata
at
the
trial
level
and
then
argue
to
this
court
that
it’s
not
an
appealable
order.
i
mean
bankruptcy
orders
have
established
these
years
ago.
if
this
is
an
appealable
order,
then
that
ruling
below
is
res
judicata.
and
that’s
why
i
submit,
we
took
the
appeal
because
of
this
and
i
submit
the
court
of
appeal
held
it
was
an
appealable
order.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subpoena
which
was
served
on
raymond
ryan
on
march
5,
1968
required
the
production
of
records,
corporate
records
covering
a
period
of
30
years,
required
the
production
of
these
records
even
though
they
were
kenya
corporations
and
all
of
the
records
subpoenaed
were
in
fact
located
in
kenya.
upon
receiving
the
subpoena,
ryan
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
mcflow
and
bryant
out
of
respect
whether
tribunal
seeking
the
records
filed
a
motion
to
quash
based
on
several
grounds
including
oppressiveness,
a
violation
of
the
law
of
kenya.
i
submit
that
petitioners
in
later
proceedings,
if
this
is
not
considered
an
appealable
order
would
be
well
advised
when
being
served
with
the
grand
jury
subpoena
not
to
file
a
motion
to
quash
and
not
to
obtain
an
interlocutory
ruling
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
compliance.
the
reason
is
very
simple.
that
had
this
subpoena
merely
been
ignored,
there
is
no
question
in
anyone’s
mind
to
just
look
at
it
that
this
subpoena
would
in
fact
have
been
void
and
invalid,
if
not
for
being
oppressive,
and
requiring
the
transportation
of
records
10,000
miles
into
the
united
states
because
the
subpoena
itself
did
in
fact
violate
the
law
of
kenya.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
pleases,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
order
of
july
25,
1968
issued
by
judge
manuel
real
of
the
district
court
of
california
requiring
respondent
ryan
to
travel
to
kenya
and
produce
2,000
pounds
of
records
at
his
own
expense
covering
a
30
year
period
was
an
appealable
order.
and
they
further
said
that,
it
was
appealable
because
it
was
a
mandatory
injunction
requiring
mr.
ryan
in
effect
to
sue
and
libel,
to
act
as
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury
to
travel
20,000
miles,
to
make
application
to
officials
of
a
foreign
country,
to
attend
and
superintend
the
packing,
the
crating
and
the
shipping
of
some
2000
pounds
of
records
to
the
united
states.
and
if
he
does
not,
if
he
was
unable
to
obtain
the
permission
of
the
kenya
officials
then
he
was
required
to
make
those
records
available
for
copying
and
i
quote,
“agents
of
the
department
of
justice
and/or
the
treasury
department.”
there
is
no
limitation
in
that
order
of
july
25,
1968
that
these
records
are
to
be
treated
as
though
they
were
subpoenaed
by
a
grand
jury,
that
they
are
under
the
secrecy
provisions
of
6
(e)
of
the
criminal
rules
as
required
by
the
grand
jury
and
in
fact,
there
was
no
limitation
on
what
right
the
government
had
with
respect
to
those
records.
they
could
publish
them
in
a
newspaper.
they
could
use
them
for
a
civil
proceeding.
they
could
use
them
for
any
purpose
even
though
ostensibly
this
proceeding
began
as
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
order
that
we’re
talking
about
and
the
subpoena,
the
district
court
himself
made
it
abundantly
clear
on
several
occasions.
he
said,
“it
is
not
the
subpoena
that
is
the
subject
of
the
contempt
charge.
it
is
not
the
subpoena
that
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
the
court’s
order
of
july
25,
1968.
it
is
the
court’s
order
that
mr.
ryan
has
to
comply
with.
it
is
the
court’s
order
that
mr.
ryan
is
in
contempt
of.
it
is
the
court’s
order
that
the
order
to
show
cause
was
directed
against
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
ryan
had
in
fact
violated
anything
issued
by
the
court.”
and
the
court
also
stated
in
a
colloquy
that
the
order
itself
of
july
25
was
like
a
civil
injunction.
therefore,
once
the
civil
injunction
was
entered,
compliance
must
be
had.
failure
to
comply
would
result
--
failure
to
comply
would
result
in
a
finding
of
contempt
and
the
findings
and
the
legal
issues
could
not
be
re-litigated
at
the
contempt
hearing.
thus,
the
--
i
know
it
and
incidentally,
i
know
that
the
government
argued
that
the
finding
and
the
various
legal
issues
would
reviewed
upon
--
reviewable
upon
appeal
if
ryan
had
in
fact
been
held
guilty
of
contempt
and
yet
there
is
respectable
which
looks
to
the
contrary
and
it
has
been
decided
by
this
court.
it
says,
when
a
civil
injunction
has
been
entered
as
here
and
there
is
a
failure
to
comply
that
then
becomes
a
contempt
and
you
may
not
re-litigate
the
factual
or
the
legal
basis
of
that
order
even
though
it
may
have
the
order
may
be
reversed
on
appeal
or
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
is
--
it
goes
far
beyond
the
capability
of
any
subpoena
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
experience
at
the
bar.
i
have
--
in
the
first
place,
it
is
an
order
requiring
a
man
to
make
an
application
to
a
high
official
of
a
foreign
government.
that’s
the
first
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no
sir,
it
does
not.
because
what
the
subpoena
says,
is
that
you
produce
the
records.
ryan,
if
he
had
custody
and
control
could
produce
the
record
or
where
it's
not
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
i
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
would
have
to
take
those
steps
that
were
within
his
power.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
order
itself.
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
order
went
far
beyond
any
legitimate
requirement
that
can
be
imposed
by
a
subpoena.
now,
if
i
may,
one,
i
do
not
believe
that
any
district
court
or
a
grand
jury
or
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury
has
the
authority
to
issue
a
subpoena
without
prepayment
of
cause
which
requires
an
individual
to
travel
10,000
miles
over
to
a
foreign
country
and
return
10,000
miles
back
carrying
with
him
2,000
pounds
of
records
for
getting
the
application
to
the
foreign
government
for
the
time
being.
i
don’t
believe
that
there
is
that
authority.
i
know
off
no
case
and
we
challenge
the
government
to
supply
us
with
any
case
in
which
that
was
in
fact
a
requirement
of
a
subpoena,
and
they
have
come
forth
with
none.
and
thus,
if
the
court
please,
equating
the
order
and
subpoena
together,
i
think
the
subpoena
goes
far
beyond
any
right
that
a
grand
jury
have
to
force
an
individual
to
sue
in
labor
as
would
be
required
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
to
forth
with
as
the
order
required,
leave,
drop
that
everything
the
citizen
is
doing,
drop
everything
the
citizen
is
doing,
go
to
a
foreign
country
10,000
miles,
25
hours
of
air
flight
to
get
to
kenya,
25
hours,
obtain
the
records,
freight
them
up,
bear
the
responsibility
of
bringing
them
back
to
the
southern
or
the
central
district
of
california
and
to
do
this
without
any
prepayment
of
expenses.
any
offer
of
round
trip
payment
of
the
aircraft
--
fare.
in
other
words,
if
ryan
were
person
an
abject
poverty,
there
isn’t
a
court
in
this
land
that
would
permit
such
a
thing
to
happen.
but
because
he
is
supposedly
a
man
of
some
means,
then
it’s
alright
that
he
has
to
spend
his
money,
thousands
of
dollars
required
for
air
fare,
the
thousands
of
dollars
to
hold
2000
pounds
of
record
back
to
the
united
states.
that
is
what
the
grand
jury
subpoena
required
and
that
is
what
the
july
25
order
requires.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
it
could
not
be
done
by
a
surface
travel,
i
don’t
believe.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
are
no
findings,
there
are
no
findings.
the
only
finding
in
this
record,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
ryan
at
times
before
and
after
the
commencement
of
the
government
investigation
had
custody
and
control
of
these
records.
and
i
submit
if
the
court
please,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
irs
investigations
commenced
in
1964.
so
what
the
finding
is
that
in
sometime
before
and
after
1964,
he
had
custody
and
control
of
the
record.
of
course,
i
challenged
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
didn’t
get
it
to
it.
but
if
i
could
address
myself
to
the
appealability
factor
here
because
i
think
it
bears
very
much
on
the
type
of
conduct
required
here.
i
would
be
concerned
if
this
court
or
if
the
court
of
appeals
have
no
supervisory
power
over
the
utilization
of
subpoena
to
require
an
individual,
for
example,
to
go
into
an
fbi
office
and
give
a
voice
exemplar.
the
grand
jury
subpoena
requiring
that,
so
that
his
voice
exemplar
might
be
compared
with
an
intercepted
telephone
conversation
to
see
whether
he
was
in
fact
the
individual.
i
think
we
are
entering
into
the
period
when
the
grand
jury
is
moving
from
its
original
purpose
and
moving
out
now
into
a
position
where
it
is
being
used
more
and
more
as
an
investigative
body
rather
than
merely
a
body
to
consider
whether
or
not
there
has
been
violation
of
crime.
and
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
you
--
that
this
order
and
this
subpoena
here
is
broader
than
anything
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
experience,
in
terms
of
requiring
an
individual
citizen
to
sue,
to
labor,
to
act
as
an
agent
of
the
grand
jury,
and
in
effect
to
investigate
for
the
grand
jury.
and
i
submit
that
the
subpoena
power
does
not
permit
that
and
i
submit
that
the
order
itself
that
the
court
could
not
in
fact
enter
an
order
of
this
nature.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
either
goes
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
orders
--
that
the
records
available
in
kenya
make
to
be
made
available
in
kenya,
be
returned
to
the
grand
jury
or
the
copies
be
returned
to
the
grand
jury.
all
it
was
that
the
record
be
turned
over
to
agents
of
the
department
of
justice
or
the
treasury
department
for
copying
and
this,
i
submit,
went
far
beyond
any
subpoena
requirements
that
could
come
out
of
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
grand
jury
subpoena
requires
those
records
be
submitted
to
the
grand
jury
and
produce
there.
this
order
did
not
require
that.
it
went
far
beyond
what
was
required.
the
--
on
the
issue
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
on
the
contrary,
it
would
not
be
appealable.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
would
be
an
affirmative
order
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
is
because
it
is
in
the
nature
of
an
order
entered
in
the
course
of
civil
litigation
and
the
requirements
there
are
that
the
way
the
order
is
enforced
is
that
the
pleadings
of
the
party
be
stricken
or
that
some
other
action
be
taken
with
respect
to
the
litigant
as
distinguished
from
here
where
you
have
an
order
directed
to
a
particular
individual.
i
would
submit,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
would
--
i
would
submit
if
that
order
were
directed
to
the
plaintiff
in
a
case,
and
if
he
refused
that
under
the
practice
certainly
of
the
federal
rules
that
that
individual
will
just
have
complaint
stricken.
that
they
would
not
--
it
would
not
be
treated
in
effect
as
mandatory
injunction
that
he
be
required
to
comply
with
the
physical
examination.
but
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
order
could
be
so
phrased
whereby
it
could
be
contempt
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
it
were
and
if
it
were
a
mandatory,
if
the
court
specifically
said,
as
was
in
this
case,
that
you
shall
forth
with
take
yourself
to
a
doctor’s
office
and
then
right
then,
under
those
circumstances
comparable
to
your
issue
here,
i
think,
you
would
have
a
question
of
an
appealability.
and
the
reason
is,
if
the
court
please,
congress
itself
which
has
established
the
appellate
jurisdiction
has
said,
that
certain
interlocutory
decisions
are
appealed,
that’s
1292.
now,
the
interlocutory
decisions
granting
an
injunction
or
a
mandatory
injunction
are
held
according
the
congress
requirement
then
may
be
appealable.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
heard
much
of
the
cobbledick
case
and
there,
you
did
not
have
any
aspects
of
an
injunction
or
a
mandatory
requirement
than
an
individual
to
take
action.
there,
all
you
had
was
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
quash
a
grand
jury
subpoena
and
the
decision
of
this
court
was
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
that
was
a
final
order,
whether
it
was
a
final
order
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1291.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mbecause,
if
the
court
please,
the
man
was
under
no
requirement
to
turn
records
over
for
copying,
for
example,
in
kenya.
there
was
no
requirement
in
that
subpoena
to
(inaudible)
for
copying
by
any
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
or
the
treasury
department.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
depending
on
the
type
of
order
and
depending
on
the
framework,
for
example,
if
it
were
in
fact
an
independent
action.
suppose
the
government
in
this
case,
instead
of
going
to
the
grand
jury
decided
to
apply
for
letters
rogatory.
then,
i
can
see
that
there
would
in
fact
when
the
letters
rogatory
had
been
entered
in
the
requirements
made
then
i
can
see
that
you
would,
in
fact,
have
a
final
order
that
would
perhaps
fall
under
the
provisions
of
1291
and
would
be
infield
because
then
you’ll
get
into
the
question
of
what
is
this
in
fact
such
an
independent
proceeding
as
will
support
an
appeal.
now
here
on
the
contrary,
you
have
the
different
situation
where
you
have
a
court
order
compelling
conduct
that
is
not
in
fact
required
by
the
original
subpoena
and
in
fact,
could
not
be
required
by
the
original
subpoena.
and
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
once
that
happens
you
go
far
beyond
any
requirements
of
merely
complying
with
the
subpoena
or
not,
you
have
moved
out
into
a
separate
independent
proceeding
where
an
individual
at
his
own
expense
has
to
fly
20,000
miles
to
get
2,000
pounds
of
records
and
bring
them
back
or
make
them
available
to
the
people
in
a
foreign
land.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
fact
that
he
was
in
kenya
was
in
fact
his
own
thing
to
be
sure,
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
imposition,
sir,
is
that
he
is
required
“forthwith”
to
make
application
and
to
do
the
things
required
in
the
order.
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
in
kenya
or
had
been
to
kenya,
i
do
not
think
makes
any
more
less
onerous
the
fact
that
he
is
required
to
produce
these
corporate
documents
from
kenya
and
plant
them
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir,
i
believe
it
goes
far
beyond
the
original
subpoena
because
it
does
what
the
subpoena
could
not
do.
it
requires
these
records
be
made
available
to
any
agent
of
the
department
of
justice
or
the
internal
revenue
service,
without
restriction.
and
the
court
of
appeals
years
ago
in
in
re
grand
jury,
229
f2nd
said
you
cannot
utilize
the
grand
jury
subpoena
in
that
matter,
it’s
improper.
that’s
been
the
law
for
years
and
that
is
where
this
order
has
gone
far
beyond,
what
a
subpoena
could
in
fact
do.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
further,
that
the
--
on
the
question
of
custody
and
control.
there
is
no
finding
that
ryan
was
in
fact,
the
director
of
these
companies
nor
could,
in
fact,
there
be
such
a
finding.
and
absent
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
finding,
it
is
a
violation
of
kenya
law
for
him
to
attempt
to
make
certain
of
these
records,
namely
the
books
of
account
available
even
in
kenya
for
copying.
and
this
argument
is
set
forth
in
extensive
in
the
brief
which
we
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
pages
22,
23,
and
24,
which
i
think
clearly
demonstrates
that
even
this
order
as
currently
drafted
violates
the
laws
of
kenya.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
is
under
rule
17.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
rule
17.
well,
rule
16
applies
to
certain
statements
and
document,
but
rule
17
submits
the
court
to
--
when
a
subpoenas
been
issued
to
require
the
records
be
produced
in
advance
of
trial
at
a
specific
date
and
time,
but
that
is
not
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
it
would
because
it
is
unlike
the
case
here
where
the
grand
jury
subpoena
subject
to
the
strictures
of
6
(e)
has
been
totally
violated
by
the
order
of
july
25
which
requires
the
records
be
made
available
to
either
treasury
or
department
of
justice
agents.
no
limitations,
no
requirement
the
record
to
be
produced
before
the
grand
jury
at
a
date
certain.
no
requirements
that
these
records
be
kept
in
camera
and
subject
to
the
rules
of
6
(e)
as
required
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
that
this
order
goes
far
beyond
what
is
compellable
by
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
mostly
to
it.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no.
it
is
not
appealable
mr.
justice
white,
for
the
simple
reason,
it
is
part
of
the
matters
proceeding
to
a
hearing.
this
case
was
not
that.
this
is
turned
into
a
completely
separate,
independent
action
to
compel
this
individual
to
produce
records.
i
would
like
to
refer
also
to
the
fact
that
when
we’re
talking
about
the
offer
of
the
federal
government
to
make
these
records
available
in
kenya
as
the
government
has
suggested,
that
offer
was
only
if
ryan
would
state,
would
authenticate
the
records.
the
trial
court
was
informed
he
could
not
authenticate
those
records
and
consequently
the
court
said,
“well
alright,
we
will
proceed
to
enter
the
order
that
we
have.”
the
--
getting
back
to
the
question
of
appealability.
under
cobbledick,
the
sole
question
was
one
of
finality
under
section
1291.
that
is
not
this
case.
that
was
solely
a
motion,
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
quash
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
this
was
not
that.
this
was
an
order
which
directed
an
individual
forthwith
to
make
application
to
a
foreign
official,
to
be
in
charge
of
bringing
back
2,000
pounds
of
records
located
10,000
miles
away
and
to
do
so
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
subpoena
would
by
implication
require
to
do
that
except,
if
the
court
please,
the
subpoena
would
not,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
apply
to
the
requirements
that
these
records
be
made
available
to
other
people.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
if
there
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
this.
i’m
saying
that
the
subpoena
is
oppressive,
i
want
the
court
very
clear
on
that,
i
was
trying
to
make
what
i
thought
was
the
distinction
between
what
the
subpoena
could
require
and
what
the
order
did
in
fact
required.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
--
in
effect,
the
subpoena
would
require
that
type
of
action
to
be
taken
except
that
the
--
when
a
subpoena
is
served,
you
have
to
use
what
capabilities
you
have
to
produce
the
records,
granted.
i
say,
that
this
order
went
far
beyond
the
subpoena
because
the
subpoena
did
not
even
by
implication
require
an
application
be
made
to
a
foreign
official
of
kenya.
now
if
in
fact,
ryan
had
to
do
this
to
get
the
records,
he
might
have
made
that
application.
he
might
have
been
required
to
make
that
application
but
this
order
made
it
specific.
furthermore,
he
was
required
to
turn
the
records
over.
he
was
tried
forthwith
to
make
that
implication.
there
was
no
time
schedule
involved.
furthermore,
he
was
required
to
bring
the
records
from
kenya
and
be
in
charge
of
those
records
to
the
court
in
los
angeles.
now,
granted
the
subpoena
would
requires
the
--
require
latter
part
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
that
even
though
the
subpoena
requirement,
this
subpoena
it
goes
far
beyond
any
that
i’ve
ever
seen
in
my
experience
and
i
wager
as
i
said
before,
we
try
as
challenged
the
government
to
show
us
a
comparable
expression
or
requirement
of
any
subpoena
or
court
order
to
produce
documents
and
they
came
up
with
exactly
no
cases
as
i
knew
they
would.
where
other
cases
have
indicated
that
if
subpoena
cannot
compel
an
individual
to
sue
and
labor,
to
act
as
an
agent
to
obtain
records,
to
get
records,
to
get
something
that
he
cannot,
does
not
have
right
at
that
available
time.
the
monroe
case
was
cited,
in
fact,
justice
frankfurter’s
comments
in
the
dissent
in
the
placement
case.
all
point
to
the
direction
i’m
saying,
that
you
cannot
use
the
grand
jury
or
its
subpoena
power
or
an
order,
a
separate
order
which
may
have
been
an
outgrowth
to
the
grand
jury
subpoena
to
require
an
individual
to
do
the
things
which
were
required
here
either
by
the
order
or
the
subpoena.
and
then
to
say
that
if
he
doesn’t
do
it,
then
he
is
guilty
of
contempt
and
has
no
chance
to
even
litigate
those
factual
issues
at
the
time
of
the
contempt
here.
as
the
court,
i’m
sure
is
aware
under
maggie
versus
zais
in
bankruptcy
turnover
orders
where
the
courts
have
those
years,
entered
an
order
saying,
“you
turn
over
these
records
or
these
assets.”
that
order
is
forthwith
and
immediately
appealable
and
then
when
the
case
goes
back
down,
the
findings
involved
in
that
case
are
not
re-litigated
at
the
trial
court
level.
they
are
considered
res
judicata
and
the
government
has
tried
to
put
ryan
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i'm
certain,
absolutely
not.
the
--
we
challenge
and
have
below,
the
finding
that
he
had
custody
and
control
of
these
records.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
are
--
well,
there
are
probably
records
there
but
he
doesn’t
have
any
control
over
those
records.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
it
is,
if
the
court
please,
we
filed
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
filed
a
motion
to
quash
and
submitted
an
affidavit
from
people
in
kenya
which
established
this
fact
and
the
court
ruled
to
the
contrary.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
certainly
do
and
i
submit
to
the
court,
he
could
not
do
so.
in
fact,
he
filed
an
affidavit
with
the
internal
revenue
service
two
years
before
the
subpoena
in
service
and
the
subpoena
in
question
was
served,
filed
an
affidavit
in
october
or
november
1968.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
couldn’t
agree
with
the
court
more
and
i
did
make
a
motion
to
quash
based
on
that.
and
of
course,
all
of
my
evidence,
i
had
to
get
in
affidavit
form
because
all
of
the
witnesses
were
in
fact
in
kenya.
and
i
filed
my
affidavits
and
the
court
--
and
the
government
filed
other
affidavits.
and
the
court
read
the
affidavits
and
says,
“i
find
that
at
times
before
and
after
the
commencement
of
the
investigation
of
mr.
ryan
by
the
federal
government,
he
had
control
of
these
documents.
and
of
course,
i
challenge
that
and
i
think
it’s
wholly
wrong
but
now,
what
happens.
so
now
if
there’s
an
order
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt
and
the
trial
court
is
saying,
“ah,
you
cannot
re-litigate
the
question
of
custody
and
control.”
the
only
thing
that
this
contempt
trial
is
going
to
be
the
government
is
not
going
to
have
to
prove
that
he
was
guilty
of
contempt
beyond
reasonable
doubt
or
had
custody
and
control
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
government,
all
they’re
going
to
have
to
show
is
that
he
had
the
capability
to
produce
the
records
on
july
25
whether
he
had
not
done
something
to
turn
it
over
and
that,
if
the
court
please,
demonstrates
the
terrible
dilemma
in
which
one
is
placed
by
filing
a
motion
to
quash.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
--
yes,
if
the
court
please,
could
be
reviewed
on
appeal.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
submit,
they
may
say
that
to
this
court
here
but
there
is
very
substantial
body
of
case
law
which
would
indicate
that
it
cannot
be
reviewed
on
appeal.
now,
whether
the
commitment
here
would
permit
us
to
raise
it
on
appeal
but
even
on
appeal,
if
the
court
please,
that’s
not
sufficient
for
my
client,
because
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
litigate
that
at
the
trial
level.
i
mean,
finding
a
man
in
contempt
is
a
very
serious
procedure.
and
the
fact
that
he
had
now
is
faced
with
the
argument
that
this
res
judicata,
i
mean,
it
will
be
held
in
contempt
on
that
issue
because
he
can’t
even
re-litigate
it
and
i
just
don’t
think
that
this
is
a
fair
or
proper
type
of
proceeding.
the
government
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
they
can’t
say
that
this
is
res
judicata
at
the
trial
level
and
then
argue
to
this
court
that
it’s
not
an
appealable
order.
i
mean
bankruptcy
orders
have
established
these
years
ago.
if
this
is
an
appealable
order,
then
that
ruling
below
is
res
judicata.
and
that’s
why
i
submit,
we
took
the
appeal
because
of
this
and
i
submit
the
court
of
appeal
held
it
was
an
appealable
order.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
