warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
now
in
number
758,
united
states
against
raymond
j.
ryan.
mr.
feit,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
make
sure
i
have
this
clear.
is
there
anything
to
interfere
with
ryan’s
rights
to
get
these
copies
anytime
he
wants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
process
involved
here
is
directed
only
at
mr.
ryan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
tell
him
to
produce
what
he
could
get
any
day
in
the
week
for
himself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
his
own
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
feit.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miller,
is
that
order
anymore
than
an
implement
to
carry
out
the
subpoena
duces
tecum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
subpoena
not
to
do
that
by
clear
implication?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn’t
that
command
that
the
subpoena
mean
when
it
directs
that
you
produce
the
records
to
do
everything
necessary
to
accomplish
that
end
whatever
it
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apply
to
the
foreign
government
to
apply
to
warrant
state
department
to
make
a
request
to
the
foreign
government,
whatever
is
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
in
this
record
that
it’s
necessary
that
he’s
commanded
to
go
to
kenya?
can't
these
things
be
done
by
correspondence
or
surface
travel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
its
that
been
--
is
that
issue
been
litigated
and
are
there
findings
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
tie
anything
to
the
subpoena?
did
not
the
subpoena
by
implication
require
him
to
do
precisely
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
that
make
it
any
more
or
less
oppressive
mr.
miller,
the
fact
that
other
people
can
look
at
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
other
people
being
officials
of
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
coercive
impact
of
the
order
is
no
greater
and
broader
than
the
subpoena,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miller,
if
hypothetically,
mr.
ryan
needed
and
wanted
these
records
for
his
own
purposes
in
the
united
states,
do
you
say
he
could
not
get
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
why
should
this
have
been
litigated
in
the
first
place
at
the
level
where
it
seems
to
me
fundamental
that
no
man
can
be
held
in
contempt
for
not
performing
an
act
which
he
cannot
perform?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
feit,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
appeal
from
what,
mr.
feit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
going
to
the
points
of
the
contempt
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
of
course
that’s
where
it
would
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
triggered
by
an
order
to
show
cause,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
is
there
any
limit
on
what
cause,
he
could
show
as
an
explanation
why
he
had
not
complied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
he
open
up
the
whole
factual
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
mr.
feit.
