were
the
findings
--
the
district
court
had
made
findings
that
this
man
had
control
of
the
records?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
those
--
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
would
those
findings
can
be
open
for
review
on
appeal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
case
what
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
can
you
say
about
the
court
of
appeals’
reasoning
as
to
why
cobbledick
did
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
state
it
in
your
answer
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
july
25th
order
have
any
independent
source
except
the
subpoena?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i’m
getting
at
is
supposing
contempt
proceeding
was
brought
against
this
man
for
a
failure
to
obey
the
subpoena,
would
the
july
25th
order
would
sustain
a
separate
contempt
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
did
order
him
to
make
--
take
certain
affirmative
action
in
kenya?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
what
you
say,
is
that
although
in
part
a
mandatory
injunction
is
really
in
essence
of
interpretation
on
what
this
man
had
to
do
in
order
to
comply
with
the
subpoena?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
form
of
the
proceeding
that
triggered
july
25th
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
a
motion
of
the
government
for
supplemental
relief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
issues
before
us
in
this
stage,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
on
this,
read
through
oppressiveness
or
other
possible
illegalities
of
the
subpoena,
it
simply
dismissed
the
appeal?
