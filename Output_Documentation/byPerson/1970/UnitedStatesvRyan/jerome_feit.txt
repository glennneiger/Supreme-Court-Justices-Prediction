mr.
jerome
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
raises
as
its
basic
issue,
the
applicability
of
the
finality
rule
of
cobbledick
against
the
united
states,
to
an
order
of
a
district
court
which
denied
a
motion
to
quash
a
grand
jury
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
at
the
same
time
modified
the
terms
of
the
subpoena.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
court
below
in
holding
the
order
appealable
prior
to
any
contempt
conviction,
disregarded
the
central
conditions
of
a
consideration
and
finality
upon
which
cobbledick
rests.
the
relevant
facts
are
these.
on
march
5,
1968,
respondent
was
served
with
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
directing
to
he
produce
before
a
grand
jury
sitting
in
the
central
district
of
california,
those
records
in
his
possession,
control
or
custody,
either
personally
or
as
a
corporate
director
of
five
enumerated
kenya
corporations.
these
were
the
ryan
investments
limited,
mawingo
limited,
mount
kenya
safari
club
limited,
zimmerman
limited,
and
seven
up
bottling
company.
later
that
month,
respondent
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena,
asserting
among
other
things
that
its
terms
were
overly
broad,
that
he
did
not
have
control
or
possession
of
the
records
and
that
removal
from
kenya
as
to
certain
of
the
records
would
violate
kenya
law.
on
five
dates
thereafter,
the
first
april
9,
1968
and
the
last
july
25,
1968,
proceedings
were
held
before
the
district
court
concerning
this
motion
to
quash.
arguments
of
counsel
during
these
proceedings
send
it
primarily
on
the
issue
of
control,
the
relationship
between
internal
revenue
summonses,
and
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
the
restrictions
of
kenya
law
regarding
the
removability
from
kenya
of
certain
of
the
records
without
the
authorization
of
kenya
authorities.
in
dealing
with
this
latter
restriction
or
latter
consideration,
namely
the
limitations
of
kenya
law
at
certain
of
the
records,
the
court
at
july
12,
at
the
july
12,
1968
hearing,
indicated
that
it
was
making
a
finding
of
control
and
suggested
that
the
parties
enter
a
stipulation
under
which
none
of
the
records
would
have
to
be
removed
from
kenya,
but
that
instead,
agents
of
the
government
representing
the
grand
jury
would
be
permitted
to
inspect
and
copy
all
the
sought
after
records
in
kenya.
the
court
made
it
clear
that
if
defense
counsel
agreed
to
this
arrangement,
he
would
be
waving
only
the
authenticity
of
the
records
and
that
all
other
objections
would
be
preserved.
the
government
agreed
to
this
procedure
and
directed
that
the
parties
try
to
work
out
some
arrangement,
mutually
satisfactory
ones.
the
court
further
pointed
out
at
this
hearing
that
if
an
agreement
could
be
worked
out,
presumably
mr.
ryan
would
not
have
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
at
all
in
connection
with
these
documents.
mr.
jerome
feit
these
were
kenya
corporations.
mr.
jerome
feit
all
of
them.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
government’s
position
was
that
mr.
ryan
was
a
director
who
owned
80%
of
ryan
--
who
owned
80%
of
the
mawingo
which
was
doing
business
at
mount
kenya
safari
club
but
he
owned
98%
of
ryan
investments
and
that
in
fact
he
was
in
control
generally
of
all
these
corporations.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
that
was
subsequently,
that
was
in
the
original
subpoena
but
the
court’s
order
which
modified
the
subpoena
excluded
the
pepsi
cola
and
one
of
the
other
companies,
the
zimmerman
company
from
the
reach
of
the
subpoena
on
the
ground
that
pepsi
cola
company
apparently
had
gone
out
of
business
several
years
before.
mr.
jerome
feit
of
kenya,
not
the
pepsi
cola
generally.
on
july
25,
counsel
reappeared
before
the
court,
respondent’s
attorney
said
that
it
could
not
agree
proposed
stipulation
since
he
did
not
believe
his
clients
could
authenticate
the
record
source.
the
court
thereupon
entered
the
order
which
is
here
in
issue
and
it's
set
forth
for
the
court’s
convenience
at
63
and
64
of
the
appendix.
in
this
order,
the
court
first
made
clear
that
it
found
that
respondent
had
control
of
the
records
of
two
or
perhaps
three
as
the
way
one
reads
it
of
the
five
companies
originally
specified
in
the
subpoena,
that
ryan
investments
limited
and
mawingo
limited
doing
business
as
the
mount
kenya
safari
club.
the
order
then
contained
three
operative
parts.
paragraph
one,
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
paragraph
two,
required
production
before
the
grand
jury
of
all
the
sought
after
records
of
the
two
companies
except
for
the
type
restricted
by
kenya
law
which
were
books
of
account,
minutes
of
meetings
and
lists
of
members.
and
paragraph
three,
dealt
with
these
restricted
records
in
the
following
way
and
this
is
at
page
64
of
the
record.
it
directed
that
respondent
forthwith
make
application
to
the
registrar
of
companies
in
kenya
to
release
the
restricted
records
and
provided
further
that
if
you
are
unable
to
secure
consent,
official
consent
for
their
release,
he
would
be
required
and
was
required
to
make
these
records
available
to
government
agents
for
copying
in
kenya.
before
the
september
11
return
date,
respondent
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
jerome
feit
there
is
nothing
in
kenya
law.
at
pages
38
and
39
of
the
record,
kenya
law
provides
that
the
records
of
corporations
be
open
to
all
directors.
and
there
is
nothing
in
kenya
law
as
far
as
we
were
able
to
ascertain,
although
i
think
respondent
contends
the
contrary
which
prohibits
such
copy.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes.
the
--
without
the
consent
of
the
registrar
of
companies,
and
this
is
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
william
shirley
deveral,
which
was
a
--
who
was
respondent’s
counsel
in
kenya
and
the
appropriate
applicable
kenya
provisions
provide
that
the
books
of
account
may
not
be
removed
from
kenya
without
the
consent
of
the
registrar
of
companies
of
kenya.
however,
as
i
say
that
the
directors
have
as
the
law
specifically
provides
have
free
access
to
these
records
and
they
must
have
free
access
to
these
records
under
kenya
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
because
the
law
so
provides
and
i
think
most
--
mr.
jerome
feit
we
have
no
authority
over
kenya
officials.
our
authority
is
over
mr.
ryan
against
whom
the
subpoena
was
issued
and
upon
whom
the
subpoena
was
served.
mr.
jerome
feit
if
kenya
said,
“no”.
well,
as
i
say,
do
you
want
to
have
two
provisions?
one,
that
they
should
make
an
application
to
kenya
authorities.
if
kenya
said,
no
we
will
not
permit
you
to
remove
the
records,
that’s
it.
we
cannot
certainly,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it’s
perfectly
settled,
we
have
no
authority
to
direct
kenya
to
do
anything
and
this
was
certainly
not
the
purport
of
the
order,
the
order
was
directed
at
respondent.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
far
as
our
position
is,
the
--
no,
there
is
no
limitation
upon
mr.
ryan’s
rights
to
provide
copies
of
these
records
which
are
restricted.
now,
i
must
add
not
all
the
records
which
were
sought
and
which
are
covered
by
the
order
were
restricted
by
kenya
law.
for
example,
correspondence
is
also
sought
as
to
the
mawingo
company
doing
business
as
mount
kenya
safari
club.
there
are
no
restrictions
under
kenya
law
for
the
removal
of
those
records.
in
specific
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
again,
there
was
no
limitation
upon
copying
of
the
records
which
were
restricted
by
kenya
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
only
at
mr.
ryan.
there's
no
question
--
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely.
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely.
mr.
jerome
feit
in
evansville,
indiana
as
far
as
in
this
country,
as
far
as
we
know.
he
maintains
an
office
and
a
residence,
i
also
believe
in
california.
and
in
addition,
he
is
a
world
traveler.
of
course
our
position
is
that
--
well,
let
me
just
continue,
that’s
precisely
what
the
order
provided
in
part
three
of
these
two
alternatives.
one,
to
seek
permission,
if
not
authorized
then
to
permit
copying.
before
the
september
11th
return
date,
respondents
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
also
sought
extraordinary
relief
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
restrain
the
district
court
from
enforcing
its
july
25th
order.
after
oral
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
application
for
extraordinary
relief,
but
extended
the
return
date
two
weeks
until
september
23.
respondent
then
applied
to
the
circuit
justice
for
a
stay
and
that
was
denied.
on
the
september
23rd
return
date,
he
did
not
produce
any
records
as
the
court
had
directed
nor
had
he
permitted
any
copying
in
kenya
and
there
was
some
suggestion
at
the
september
23
hearing
that
he
had
made
an
application
to
kenya
authorities
for
removal
of
certain
of
the
restricted
records
and
that
had
been
denied.
however,
he
had
not
made
the
records
available
for
copying
nor
had
he
produced
the
correspondence
essentially
which
was
not
governed
by
the
restrictions
of
kenya
law.
as
i
say,
here
before
the
grand
jury
to
claim
his
privilege.
thereafter
civil
contempt
proceedings
were
instituted
by
an
order
to
show
cause
and
hearings
were
held
on
several
occasions
in
the
fall
of
1968.
on
december
10,
1968,
on
the
government’s
motion,
the
order
to
show
cause
was
transformed
into
an
order
to
show
cause
why
respondent
should
not
be
held
in
criminal
contempt.
now,
this
transformation
occurred
because
the
grand
jury
selection
act
of
1968
was
to
go
into
effect
on
the
21st
of
december
and
this
grand
jury
was
to
expire
on
that
date.
also
on
december
10,
1968,
an
indictment
was
returned
by
this
grand
jury
charging
that
respondent
had
falsified
records
which
he
had
been
ordered
to
produce
before
1967
grand
jury
in
the
summer
of
1967.
that
case
was
ultimately
tried
this
past
summer.
respondent
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
three
years
to
jail.
mr.
jerome
feit
on
the
charge
that
in
the
1967
grand
jury
subpoena
which
required
production
of
mount
kenya
correspondence
within
this
country
that
he
had
produced,
but
falsified
the
documents.
he
was
convicted,
as
i
say,
in
this
summer
and
is
presently
pending
on
appeal.
mr.
jerome
feit
for
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
the
authorization
dealt
primarily
--
well,
primarily
interstate
operation,
transformation
of
gambling
information,
income
tax
violations
perhaps.
beyond
that
primarily,
i
think
counsels
have
stated
to
the
court,
primarily
the
interstate
transportation
and
information
of
gambling
information
under
1952
which
was
basically
grand
jury’s
--
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury’s
investigation
as
i
understand.
of
course,
grand
jury’s
investigation
may
well
uncover
other
matters
not
specifically
within
that.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
he
has
not
been
convicted.
that’s
precisely
why
we’re
here.
he
was
not
convicted
of
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
what
happened
was
when
the
grand
jury,
just
before
the
grand
jury
expired
as
i
said
on
december
10th,
the
proceeding
was
transformed
into
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
and
it
dragged
on
with
letters
rogatory
being
sought
by
respondent,
false
interrogatories
being
sought
by
government
counsel
until
finally,
in
october
of
1969
trial
had
been
set
for
december
of
1969
on
the
contempt,
criminal
contempt
charge.
now,
the
grand
jury
had
expired.
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
that
proceeding
and
a
year
later,
more
than
a
year
later,
in
may
of
1970,
it
issued
the
opinion
and
order
which
is
presently
before
the
court
finding
that
the
order
was
appealable
despite
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
contempt
conviction
and
broad
and
vague
on
merits
and
it
is
that
question
which
is
here
before
the
court
namely
the
interlocutory
appeal
problem
before
there
has
been
any
contempt
conviction
which
leads
me
precisely
into
my
basic
argument.
i
think
there
is
no
dispute,
the
july
25,
1968
order
is
fully
appealable
if
and
when
is
held
in
contempt.
the
sole
dispute
is
whether,
it’s
now
appealable
and
its
common
ground
that
that
depends
upon
the
application
of
the
cobbledick
case
which
this
court
decided
some
30
years
ago,
unanimously.
mr.
jerome
feit
that’s
right.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
on
appeal
presumed
after
a
contempt
conviction
--
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
our
position
would
be
that
those
findings
are
clearly
not
foreclosed,
that
they’re
fully
open
to
review
on
appeal
from
a
contempt
conviction
and
this
is
precisely
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
say
cobbledick
controls
because
one
of
the
exceptions,
the
well-recognized
and
traditional
exceptions
to
cobbledick
is
the
case
in
where,
unless
you
permit
an
immediate
appeal,
stack
versus
boyle
comes
immediately
to
mind,
where
a
bail
was
sought
pending
trial.
unless
you
get
the
appeal,
that
issue
is
mooted
out,
there
is
nothing
further
to
decide.
our
position
is
quite
plain
that
the
july
25
order
is
fully
reviewable,
on
appeal,
should
respondent
be
held
in
contempt.
as
the
court
will
recall,
cobbledick
involved
the
question
of
a
district
court
denying
a
motion
to
quash
grand
jury
subpoena
duces
tecum.
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case,
that
case
was
also
a
ninth
circuit
case
had
held
there
had
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
appeals
and
dismissed
the
appeals.
this
court
affirmed
unanimously
and
announced
what
has
become
the
classic
expression
of
the
finality
doctrine
in
criminal
cases.
the
court
first
addressed
the
historic
roots,
noting
that
the
first
judiciary
act
had
contained
a
finality
provision,
but
did
not
solely
rely
under
historical
considerations.
on
the
contrary,
it
delineated
the
crucial
policy
considerations
which
give
continuing
vitality
to
the
concept
of
finality
under
cobbledick.
that
is
the
elimination
of
delay
and
harassment
and
costs
of
individual
appeal
of
each
order
in
a
unitary
court.
mr.
jerome
feit
we
don’t
think
so,
there
was
no
--
and
we
find
nothing
that
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
respondent
claims
that
the
order
in
the
court
of
appeal
held
here
that
the
order
was
appealable
under
the
interlocutory
provisions
of
1292
(a)
(1).
mr.
jerome
feit
yes.
it
seems
to
us
quite
clearly
no.
we
find
no
case
which
supports
the
notion
that
1292
(a)
(1)
applies
to
an
order
of
a
court
modifying
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
far
as
we
know,
there
was
no
application
made
for
certificate.
in
cobbledick,
the
court
stated
the
basic
rationale
which
we
think
governs
here
and
younger
and
harris
in
a
different,
in
a
somewhat
different
context.
the
court
suggested
the
same
type
of
consideration
that
is
bearing
that
and
i’m
quoting
from
cobbledick,
“bearing
a
discomfiture
and
cost
of
a
prosecution
for
crime
even
by
an
innocent
person
is
one
of
the
painful
obligations
of
citizenship.
the
correctness
of
a
trial
court’s
rejection
even
of
a
constitutional
claim
made
by
the
accused
in
the
process
of
prosecution
must
await
its
conviction
before
its
reconsideration
by
an
appellate
tribunal.
this
doctrine
was
particularly
applicable,”
the
court
was
of
the
view,
“in
a
grand
jury
situation
because
of
its
essential
and
primary
function
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law
as
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly.
short
18
months
generally
and
governed
by
a
statute,
an
interruption
of
its
work
have
to
be
avoided.”
cobbledick
concluded
that
interruption
of
its
proceedings
by
an
appeal
by
a
balking
witness
was
permissible
only
after
the
witness
had
been
held
in
contempt.
at
that
point,
even
though
the
grand
jury’s
process
was
being
interrupted
such
interruption
was
justified,
otherwise,
the
witness
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
abandon
his
claim
or
languish
in
jail.
obviously,
in
weighing
the
considerations
of
finality
against
immediate
interlocutory
review,
this
court
in
cobbledick
took
account
of
the
deterrent
nature
of
the
contempt
power.
that
the
threat
of
the
exercise
of
that
power
would
have
real
potential
in
compelling
an
otherwise
recalcitrant
witness
to
produce
or
testify
as
ordered.
this
coercive
potential,
i
submit,
was
deemed
proper
and
was
the
balance
struck
in
cobbledick
because
of
the
overwhelming
importance
of
the
grand
jury
function
and
the
need
to
prevent
its
interruption
by
the
frivolous
claim.
it
could
only
be
interrupted,
the
court
found
by
those
witnesses
whose
refusal
to
comply
was
of
such
paramount
significance
to
them
that
they
would
refuse
even
though
faced
with
a
contempt
citation,
contempt
conviction,
only
if
that
point,
the
detail
--
that
the
scales
fit
and
favor
of
appealability
and
permit
interruption
of
a
grand
jury
investigation.
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
have
strengthened
cobbledick
are
referred
by
dibella
against
the
united
states
where
this
court
held,
appeals
unavailable
to
challenge
orders
denying
motions
to
suppress
evidence
where
criminal
proceedings
were
in
frame
at
the
time
of
the
ruling.
in
the
course
of
dibella,
the
court
significantly
pointed
out
that
every
statutory
exception’s
finality
is
addressed
either
in
terms
or
by
necessary
operation
to
civil
actions.
there
has
been
thus
no
retreat
from
the
cobbledick
rule
that
the
cost
and
discomfiture
of
a
trial
even
as
to
a
constitutional
claim
must
be
gone
through
before
the
witness
challenging
a
grand
jury
subpoena
may
bring
that
matter
to
an
appellate
court.
there
is
no
sound
reason,
we
submit,
why
these
principles
should
not
govern
this
case.
we
point
out
again
that
the
question
regarding
control
and
all
other
issues
involved
in
the
july
25
order
will
be
fully
reviewable
on
appeal
if
respondent
is
held
in
contempt.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
find
it
somewhat
mystified.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
and
this
is
set
out
in
precise
language.
it
set
out
at
72
of
the
record
and
they
said,
“none
of
the
cases
cited
had
the
district
court
ordered
anything
other
than
compliance
with
the
subpoena.
in
contrast,
the
district
court
here
modified
the
subpoena
with
respect
to
certain
documents
and
directed
the
appellant
to
undertake
steps
in
a
foreign
country
to
have
those
documents
released
by
other
persons
for
transportation
to
this
country
or
for
inspection
in
kenya
by
united
states
agents.
in
directing
that
affirmative
action
be
taken
in
another
country,
the
district
court
did
more
than
deny
a
motion
to
quash.
it
in
effect
granted
a
mandatory
injunction,
which
given
full-effect,
would
require
action
by
officials
of
the
kenyan
government.”
my
answer
is
to
that
i
don’t
know
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
question
of
appealability.
the
court
simply,
it
seems
to
me,
by
calling
an
order
of
a
court
which
has
complete
control
over
the
grand
jury
process.
the
grand
jury
has
no
authority
to
subpoena
documents
without
the
authority
of
the
court.
and
the
court
has
full
authority
to
modify
and
change,
if
a
court
is
limited
by
the
notion
that
any
modification
which
might
have
some
affirmative
effect,
will
result
in
appealability,
we
think
that
the
courts
will
be
hesitant
to
do
what
they
should
do,
modify,
change
subpoenas
of
grand
juries.
i
see
nothing
in
the
fact
that
it
in
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
nor
in
the
cases
which
it
cites
which
takes
this
out
of
the
cobbledick
rule.
if
this
takes
it
out
of
the
cobbledick
rule,
then
i
don’t
know
why
a
subpoena
directing
production
of
documents,
for
example
which
are
located
in
new
york
city,
which
are
sought
by
a
grand
jury
sitting
in
central
district
of
california,
is
similarly
not
outside
the
cobbledick
rule.
the
problem
here,
it
seems
to
me
is
that
there’s
no
sound
basis
for
continued
adherence
to
cobbledick
if
one
can
simply
by
talking
about
affirmative
directions
of
an
order
transform
that
into
a
1292
(a)
(1)
injunction.
the
history
of
1292
(a)
(1),
neither
the
history
of
1292
(a)
(1)
nor
its
application
by
this
court
in
the
bollinger
case,
switzerland
cheese
association
case
have
indicated
--
has
indicated
that
even
in
civil
actions,
the
court
has
been
not
prone
to
apply
that
provision
except
where
there
is
truly
an
injunction,
and
here,
i
think
to
talk
about
this
being
an
injunction
in
terms
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
would
hamper
and
to
make
it
quite
easy,
to
avoid
the
grand
jury
investigation.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
far
as
i
know,
the
july
25th
order
was
based
upon
the
subpoena
because
it
part
one
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
mr.
jerome
feit
no.
the
order
of
july
25th,
what
that
did
was,
it
took
the
subpoena
and
in
our
view
eased
the
burdens
of
compliance.
it
transformed
the
subpoena
into
a
different
kind
of
a
document
retaining
the
grand
jury
function
that
it
was
perform,
but
there
are
no
two
independent
documents
now
outstanding.
in
answer
to
your
question
there
will
be
no
basis
for
a
contempt
with
regard
to
the
subpoena
and
then
a
contempt
with
regard
to
the
order.
there
would
be
one
contempt.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
order
did,
yes.
it
told
him
to
apply
the
registrar
of
companies
to
produce
or
permit
removal
from
kenya
a
certain
documents.
if
that
request
were
denied,
he
was
to
permit
agents
and
we
believe
agents
of
the
grand
jury,
an
argument
is
made
here
that
these
records
would
have
been
available
for
the
civil
tax.
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely
and
as
i
say,
my
point
was
that
the
subpoena
issues
through
the
authority
of
the
court
and
the
order
of
the
court,
modifying
the
subpoena,
requiring
affirmative
action,
was
merely
a
clarification
which
made
precise
and
particularized
the
duties
that
the
respondent
was
required
to
perform.
and
it’s
our
view
that
if
that
is
a
mandatory
injunction,
then
any
kind
of
modification
by
a
judge
of
a
subpoena
can
be
classified
the
same
way
and
that
the
policy
decisions
of
cobbledick
and
dibella
can
be
very
easily
avoided.
mr.
jerome
feit
it
was
a
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
duces
tecum.
mr.
jerome
feit
oh,
no.
the
situation
was
this.
the
subpoena
was
served,
as
i
said,
on
march
5,
1968.
a
motion
to
quash
alleging
a
variety
of
grounds
was
made
towards
the
end
of
march
and
thereafter,
the
five
proceedings
which
led
up
to
the
july
25
order,
where
wholly
in
connection
with
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
mr.
jerome
feit
well
we
--
mr.
jerome
feit
i
assume
so
because
any
subpoena
requires
some
affirmative
action
implicit
in
it
or
produce
records,
one
must,
if
he
has
them
in
his
warehouse,
he
must
go
to
the
warehouse
and
get
them.
so
that,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
it
seems
to
me
has
opened
the
door
for
an
easy
way
to
avoid
the
very
significant
requirements
of
cobbledick
and
which
this
court
has
reaffirmed
in
dibella
and
it
is
our
view
that
1292
(a)
(1)
does
not
provide
the
remedy
nor
the
cost
and
delay
argument
that
respondent
makes.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
the
court
exercising
its
authority,
historic
authority
to
promote
the
functioning
of
the
grand
jury.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
should
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
it
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
i’d
like
to
make
two
points.
first,
in
volume
three
of
the
original
record
which
is
here,
i’ll
refer
the
court
to
pages
112
in
which
the
united
states
attorney
makes
it
quite
plain
that
these
records
would
be
used
only
for
the
grand
jury
purpose
that
is
those
who
inspect
the
records
in
kenya.
again,
on
pages
90
and
91,
where
the
district
court
further
makes
it
plain
that
these
records
and
that
the
agents
who
were
to
examine
them
were
agents
in
fact
of
the
grand
jury
and
there
would
be
no
violation
of
rule
6
(e).
it
seems
to
me
that
the
thrust
to
the
argument
here
essentially
is
that
cobbledick
really
should
not
be
followed.
as
we
have
indicated,
there
is
no
question
that
this
issue
would
be
resolved
or
would
be
litigated
on
appeal,
the
validity
to
the
july
25
order.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
it
could
be
reviewed
in
contempt
proceeding.
it
seems
to
us
that
it’s
the
--
that
was
from
april
to
june
25,
1968,
the
issue
of
custody
and
control
was
litigated.
just
like
a
motion
to
suppress
it
seems
to
us,
if
respondent
has
additional
evidence
which
would
suggest
that
he
does
not
have
custody
and
control
as
the
court
in
a
motion
to
suppress
which
had
the
court
to
change
its
mind.
however,
it’s
clear
that
this
is
litigable
on
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jerome
feit
on
appeal
from
the
finding
in
contempt
which
is
precisely
cobbledick
and
precisely
what
this
court
has
reaffirmed
in
cases
since
cobbledick
and
i
may
have
one
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
i
would
assume
that
this
would
--
our
view
would
be.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
the
appeal
from
the
contempt
and
he
--
counsel
refers
to
cases
which
i
don’t
know
of
and
which
he
refers
to
cases
in
which
that
order
of
july
25
would
not
be
reviewable
on
appeal.
he
refers
to
cases,
i
know
of
no
such
cases
involving
grand
jury
subpoenas
and
orders
enforcing
grand
jury
subpoenas.
what
happened
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
is
that,
the
initial
determination
was
made
that
he
had
custody
and
control,
an
opportunity
to
litigate
that
on
five
occasions
from
april
to
july.
i
would
take
it.
it
would
be
something
like
law
of
the
case
not
res
judicata.
quite
clearly,
if
he
could
come
in
and
say
at
that
date,
“i
have
something
new.
i
can
show
you
by
an
evidentiary
basis
that
i
did
not
have
custody
and
control
of
the
records
as
of
the
date
of
july
25th.”
it
seems
to
me,
just
as
in
a
motion
to
suppress
where
the
court
could
reconsider,
the
court
could
say,
“we
reconsider
that,
and
we
find
that
you
do
not
have
control.
therefore,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
contempt.”
the
court
on
the
other
hand
could
well
say,
“you
haven’t
submitted
enough
for
me
to
reopen
this.
i
proceed
with
the
contempt
proceeding.
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.”
and
on
appeal
from
the
contempt
proceeding
quite
clearly,
the
july
25,
1968
order
would
be
subject
to
full
review.
and
again
i
say
counsel
referred
to
some
cases
to
the
contrary,
“i
know
of
none
involving
the
area
of
the
grand
jury
subpoena
and
the
enforcement
thereof
by
the
district
court
order.”
mr.
jerome
feit
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
as
it
was
here.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
there’s
no
limitation
--
mr.
jerome
feit
there’s
no
limitation
except
as
i
suggest
that
the
way
the
district
court
runs
the
contempt
proceeding.
the
district
court
can
say,
“i
don’t
know
what
the
evidence
of
control
that
mr.
miller,
might
or
might
not
bring
out,
the
proceedings
leading
up
to
the
july
25
order
were
essentially
arguments
of
counsel
would
some
testimony
but
very
little
and
affidavits
in
produced.
yes,
the
district
court
could
entertain
it
seems
to
me
all
of
these
matters
and
say,
“well,
if
you
have
something
to
show
that
you
didn’t
show
me
before,
that
suggests
that
you
have
no
control,
i’m
going
to
re-litigate
that
matter.
well,
i’m
suggesting
is
whether
the
court
does
or
does
not,
that
issue
would
be
fully
reviewable
on
appeal.
mr.
jerome
feit
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
raises
as
its
basic
issue,
the
applicability
of
the
finality
rule
of
cobbledick
against
the
united
states,
to
an
order
of
a
district
court
which
denied
a
motion
to
quash
a
grand
jury
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
at
the
same
time
modified
the
terms
of
the
subpoena.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
court
below
in
holding
the
order
appealable
prior
to
any
contempt
conviction,
disregarded
the
central
conditions
of
a
consideration
and
finality
upon
which
cobbledick
rests.
the
relevant
facts
are
these.
on
march
5,
1968,
respondent
was
served
with
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
directing
to
he
produce
before
a
grand
jury
sitting
in
the
central
district
of
california,
those
records
in
his
possession,
control
or
custody,
either
personally
or
as
a
corporate
director
of
five
enumerated
kenya
corporations.
these
were
the
ryan
investments
limited,
mawingo
limited,
mount
kenya
safari
club
limited,
zimmerman
limited,
and
seven
up
bottling
company.
later
that
month,
respondent
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena,
asserting
among
other
things
that
its
terms
were
overly
broad,
that
he
did
not
have
control
or
possession
of
the
records
and
that
removal
from
kenya
as
to
certain
of
the
records
would
violate
kenya
law.
on
five
dates
thereafter,
the
first
april
9,
1968
and
the
last
july
25,
1968,
proceedings
were
held
before
the
district
court
concerning
this
motion
to
quash.
arguments
of
counsel
during
these
proceedings
send
it
primarily
on
the
issue
of
control,
the
relationship
between
internal
revenue
summonses,
and
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
the
restrictions
of
kenya
law
regarding
the
removability
from
kenya
of
certain
of
the
records
without
the
authorization
of
kenya
authorities.
in
dealing
with
this
latter
restriction
or
latter
consideration,
namely
the
limitations
of
kenya
law
at
certain
of
the
records,
the
court
at
july
12,
at
the
july
12,
1968
hearing,
indicated
that
it
was
making
a
finding
of
control
and
suggested
that
the
parties
enter
a
stipulation
under
which
none
of
the
records
would
have
to
be
removed
from
kenya,
but
that
instead,
agents
of
the
government
representing
the
grand
jury
would
be
permitted
to
inspect
and
copy
all
the
sought
after
records
in
kenya.
the
court
made
it
clear
that
if
defense
counsel
agreed
to
this
arrangement,
he
would
be
waving
only
the
authenticity
of
the
records
and
that
all
other
objections
would
be
preserved.
the
government
agreed
to
this
procedure
and
directed
that
the
parties
try
to
work
out
some
arrangement,
mutually
satisfactory
ones.
the
court
further
pointed
out
at
this
hearing
that
if
an
agreement
could
be
worked
out,
presumably
mr.
ryan
would
not
have
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
at
all
in
connection
with
these
documents.
mr.
jerome
feit
these
were
kenya
corporations.
mr.
jerome
feit
all
of
them.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
government’s
position
was
that
mr.
ryan
was
a
director
who
owned
80%
of
ryan
--
who
owned
80%
of
the
mawingo
which
was
doing
business
at
mount
kenya
safari
club
but
he
owned
98%
of
ryan
investments
and
that
in
fact
he
was
in
control
generally
of
all
these
corporations.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
that
was
subsequently,
that
was
in
the
original
subpoena
but
the
court’s
order
which
modified
the
subpoena
excluded
the
pepsi
cola
and
one
of
the
other
companies,
the
zimmerman
company
from
the
reach
of
the
subpoena
on
the
ground
that
pepsi
cola
company
apparently
had
gone
out
of
business
several
years
before.
mr.
jerome
feit
of
kenya,
not
the
pepsi
cola
generally.
on
july
25,
counsel
reappeared
before
the
court,
respondent’s
attorney
said
that
it
could
not
agree
proposed
stipulation
since
he
did
not
believe
his
clients
could
authenticate
the
record
source.
the
court
thereupon
entered
the
order
which
is
here
in
issue
and
it's
set
forth
for
the
court’s
convenience
at
63
and
64
of
the
appendix.
in
this
order,
the
court
first
made
clear
that
it
found
that
respondent
had
control
of
the
records
of
two
or
perhaps
three
as
the
way
one
reads
it
of
the
five
companies
originally
specified
in
the
subpoena,
that
ryan
investments
limited
and
mawingo
limited
doing
business
as
the
mount
kenya
safari
club.
the
order
then
contained
three
operative
parts.
paragraph
one,
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
paragraph
two,
required
production
before
the
grand
jury
of
all
the
sought
after
records
of
the
two
companies
except
for
the
type
restricted
by
kenya
law
which
were
books
of
account,
minutes
of
meetings
and
lists
of
members.
and
paragraph
three,
dealt
with
these
restricted
records
in
the
following
way
and
this
is
at
page
64
of
the
record.
it
directed
that
respondent
forthwith
make
application
to
the
registrar
of
companies
in
kenya
to
release
the
restricted
records
and
provided
further
that
if
you
are
unable
to
secure
consent,
official
consent
for
their
release,
he
would
be
required
and
was
required
to
make
these
records
available
to
government
agents
for
copying
in
kenya.
before
the
september
11
return
date,
respondent
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
jerome
feit
there
is
nothing
in
kenya
law.
at
pages
38
and
39
of
the
record,
kenya
law
provides
that
the
records
of
corporations
be
open
to
all
directors.
and
there
is
nothing
in
kenya
law
as
far
as
we
were
able
to
ascertain,
although
i
think
respondent
contends
the
contrary
which
prohibits
such
copy.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes.
the
--
without
the
consent
of
the
registrar
of
companies,
and
this
is
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
william
shirley
deveral,
which
was
a
--
who
was
respondent’s
counsel
in
kenya
and
the
appropriate
applicable
kenya
provisions
provide
that
the
books
of
account
may
not
be
removed
from
kenya
without
the
consent
of
the
registrar
of
companies
of
kenya.
however,
as
i
say
that
the
directors
have
as
the
law
specifically
provides
have
free
access
to
these
records
and
they
must
have
free
access
to
these
records
under
kenya
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
because
the
law
so
provides
and
i
think
most
--
mr.
jerome
feit
we
have
no
authority
over
kenya
officials.
our
authority
is
over
mr.
ryan
against
whom
the
subpoena
was
issued
and
upon
whom
the
subpoena
was
served.
mr.
jerome
feit
if
kenya
said,
“no”.
well,
as
i
say,
do
you
want
to
have
two
provisions?
one,
that
they
should
make
an
application
to
kenya
authorities.
if
kenya
said,
no
we
will
not
permit
you
to
remove
the
records,
that’s
it.
we
cannot
certainly,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it’s
perfectly
settled,
we
have
no
authority
to
direct
kenya
to
do
anything
and
this
was
certainly
not
the
purport
of
the
order,
the
order
was
directed
at
respondent.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
far
as
our
position
is,
the
--
no,
there
is
no
limitation
upon
mr.
ryan’s
rights
to
provide
copies
of
these
records
which
are
restricted.
now,
i
must
add
not
all
the
records
which
were
sought
and
which
are
covered
by
the
order
were
restricted
by
kenya
law.
for
example,
correspondence
is
also
sought
as
to
the
mawingo
company
doing
business
as
mount
kenya
safari
club.
there
are
no
restrictions
under
kenya
law
for
the
removal
of
those
records.
in
specific
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
again,
there
was
no
limitation
upon
copying
of
the
records
which
were
restricted
by
kenya
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
only
at
mr.
ryan.
there's
no
question
--
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely.
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely.
mr.
jerome
feit
in
evansville,
indiana
as
far
as
in
this
country,
as
far
as
we
know.
he
maintains
an
office
and
a
residence,
i
also
believe
in
california.
and
in
addition,
he
is
a
world
traveler.
of
course
our
position
is
that
--
well,
let
me
just
continue,
that’s
precisely
what
the
order
provided
in
part
three
of
these
two
alternatives.
one,
to
seek
permission,
if
not
authorized
then
to
permit
copying.
before
the
september
11th
return
date,
respondents
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
also
sought
extraordinary
relief
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
restrain
the
district
court
from
enforcing
its
july
25th
order.
after
oral
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
application
for
extraordinary
relief,
but
extended
the
return
date
two
weeks
until
september
23.
respondent
then
applied
to
the
circuit
justice
for
a
stay
and
that
was
denied.
on
the
september
23rd
return
date,
he
did
not
produce
any
records
as
the
court
had
directed
nor
had
he
permitted
any
copying
in
kenya
and
there
was
some
suggestion
at
the
september
23
hearing
that
he
had
made
an
application
to
kenya
authorities
for
removal
of
certain
of
the
restricted
records
and
that
had
been
denied.
however,
he
had
not
made
the
records
available
for
copying
nor
had
he
produced
the
correspondence
essentially
which
was
not
governed
by
the
restrictions
of
kenya
law.
as
i
say,
here
before
the
grand
jury
to
claim
his
privilege.
thereafter
civil
contempt
proceedings
were
instituted
by
an
order
to
show
cause
and
hearings
were
held
on
several
occasions
in
the
fall
of
1968.
on
december
10,
1968,
on
the
government’s
motion,
the
order
to
show
cause
was
transformed
into
an
order
to
show
cause
why
respondent
should
not
be
held
in
criminal
contempt.
now,
this
transformation
occurred
because
the
grand
jury
selection
act
of
1968
was
to
go
into
effect
on
the
21st
of
december
and
this
grand
jury
was
to
expire
on
that
date.
also
on
december
10,
1968,
an
indictment
was
returned
by
this
grand
jury
charging
that
respondent
had
falsified
records
which
he
had
been
ordered
to
produce
before
1967
grand
jury
in
the
summer
of
1967.
that
case
was
ultimately
tried
this
past
summer.
respondent
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
three
years
to
jail.
mr.
jerome
feit
on
the
charge
that
in
the
1967
grand
jury
subpoena
which
required
production
of
mount
kenya
correspondence
within
this
country
that
he
had
produced,
but
falsified
the
documents.
he
was
convicted,
as
i
say,
in
this
summer
and
is
presently
pending
on
appeal.
mr.
jerome
feit
for
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
the
authorization
dealt
primarily
--
well,
primarily
interstate
operation,
transformation
of
gambling
information,
income
tax
violations
perhaps.
beyond
that
primarily,
i
think
counsels
have
stated
to
the
court,
primarily
the
interstate
transportation
and
information
of
gambling
information
under
1952
which
was
basically
grand
jury’s
--
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury’s
investigation
as
i
understand.
of
course,
grand
jury’s
investigation
may
well
uncover
other
matters
not
specifically
within
that.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
he
has
not
been
convicted.
that’s
precisely
why
we’re
here.
he
was
not
convicted
of
anything.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
what
happened
was
when
the
grand
jury,
just
before
the
grand
jury
expired
as
i
said
on
december
10th,
the
proceeding
was
transformed
into
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
and
it
dragged
on
with
letters
rogatory
being
sought
by
respondent,
false
interrogatories
being
sought
by
government
counsel
until
finally,
in
october
of
1969
trial
had
been
set
for
december
of
1969
on
the
contempt,
criminal
contempt
charge.
now,
the
grand
jury
had
expired.
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
that
proceeding
and
a
year
later,
more
than
a
year
later,
in
may
of
1970,
it
issued
the
opinion
and
order
which
is
presently
before
the
court
finding
that
the
order
was
appealable
despite
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
contempt
conviction
and
broad
and
vague
on
merits
and
it
is
that
question
which
is
here
before
the
court
namely
the
interlocutory
appeal
problem
before
there
has
been
any
contempt
conviction
which
leads
me
precisely
into
my
basic
argument.
i
think
there
is
no
dispute,
the
july
25,
1968
order
is
fully
appealable
if
and
when
is
held
in
contempt.
the
sole
dispute
is
whether,
it’s
now
appealable
and
its
common
ground
that
that
depends
upon
the
application
of
the
cobbledick
case
which
this
court
decided
some
30
years
ago,
unanimously.
mr.
jerome
feit
that’s
right.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
on
appeal
presumed
after
a
contempt
conviction
--
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
our
position
would
be
that
those
findings
are
clearly
not
foreclosed,
that
they’re
fully
open
to
review
on
appeal
from
a
contempt
conviction
and
this
is
precisely
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
say
cobbledick
controls
because
one
of
the
exceptions,
the
well-recognized
and
traditional
exceptions
to
cobbledick
is
the
case
in
where,
unless
you
permit
an
immediate
appeal,
stack
versus
boyle
comes
immediately
to
mind,
where
a
bail
was
sought
pending
trial.
unless
you
get
the
appeal,
that
issue
is
mooted
out,
there
is
nothing
further
to
decide.
our
position
is
quite
plain
that
the
july
25
order
is
fully
reviewable,
on
appeal,
should
respondent
be
held
in
contempt.
as
the
court
will
recall,
cobbledick
involved
the
question
of
a
district
court
denying
a
motion
to
quash
grand
jury
subpoena
duces
tecum.
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case,
that
case
was
also
a
ninth
circuit
case
had
held
there
had
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
appeals
and
dismissed
the
appeals.
this
court
affirmed
unanimously
and
announced
what
has
become
the
classic
expression
of
the
finality
doctrine
in
criminal
cases.
the
court
first
addressed
the
historic
roots,
noting
that
the
first
judiciary
act
had
contained
a
finality
provision,
but
did
not
solely
rely
under
historical
considerations.
on
the
contrary,
it
delineated
the
crucial
policy
considerations
which
give
continuing
vitality
to
the
concept
of
finality
under
cobbledick.
that
is
the
elimination
of
delay
and
harassment
and
costs
of
individual
appeal
of
each
order
in
a
unitary
court.
mr.
jerome
feit
we
don’t
think
so,
there
was
no
--
and
we
find
nothing
that
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
respondent
claims
that
the
order
in
the
court
of
appeal
held
here
that
the
order
was
appealable
under
the
interlocutory
provisions
of
1292
(a)
(1).
mr.
jerome
feit
yes.
it
seems
to
us
quite
clearly
no.
we
find
no
case
which
supports
the
notion
that
1292
(a)
(1)
applies
to
an
order
of
a
court
modifying
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
far
as
we
know,
there
was
no
application
made
for
certificate.
in
cobbledick,
the
court
stated
the
basic
rationale
which
we
think
governs
here
and
younger
and
harris
in
a
different,
in
a
somewhat
different
context.
the
court
suggested
the
same
type
of
consideration
that
is
bearing
that
and
i’m
quoting
from
cobbledick,
“bearing
a
discomfiture
and
cost
of
a
prosecution
for
crime
even
by
an
innocent
person
is
one
of
the
painful
obligations
of
citizenship.
the
correctness
of
a
trial
court’s
rejection
even
of
a
constitutional
claim
made
by
the
accused
in
the
process
of
prosecution
must
await
its
conviction
before
its
reconsideration
by
an
appellate
tribunal.
this
doctrine
was
particularly
applicable,”
the
court
was
of
the
view,
“in
a
grand
jury
situation
because
of
its
essential
and
primary
function
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law
as
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly.
short
18
months
generally
and
governed
by
a
statute,
an
interruption
of
its
work
have
to
be
avoided.”
cobbledick
concluded
that
interruption
of
its
proceedings
by
an
appeal
by
a
balking
witness
was
permissible
only
after
the
witness
had
been
held
in
contempt.
at
that
point,
even
though
the
grand
jury’s
process
was
being
interrupted
such
interruption
was
justified,
otherwise,
the
witness
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
abandon
his
claim
or
languish
in
jail.
obviously,
in
weighing
the
considerations
of
finality
against
immediate
interlocutory
review,
this
court
in
cobbledick
took
account
of
the
deterrent
nature
of
the
contempt
power.
that
the
threat
of
the
exercise
of
that
power
would
have
real
potential
in
compelling
an
otherwise
recalcitrant
witness
to
produce
or
testify
as
ordered.
this
coercive
potential,
i
submit,
was
deemed
proper
and
was
the
balance
struck
in
cobbledick
because
of
the
overwhelming
importance
of
the
grand
jury
function
and
the
need
to
prevent
its
interruption
by
the
frivolous
claim.
it
could
only
be
interrupted,
the
court
found
by
those
witnesses
whose
refusal
to
comply
was
of
such
paramount
significance
to
them
that
they
would
refuse
even
though
faced
with
a
contempt
citation,
contempt
conviction,
only
if
that
point,
the
detail
--
that
the
scales
fit
and
favor
of
appealability
and
permit
interruption
of
a
grand
jury
investigation.
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
have
strengthened
cobbledick
are
referred
by
dibella
against
the
united
states
where
this
court
held,
appeals
unavailable
to
challenge
orders
denying
motions
to
suppress
evidence
where
criminal
proceedings
were
in
frame
at
the
time
of
the
ruling.
in
the
course
of
dibella,
the
court
significantly
pointed
out
that
every
statutory
exception’s
finality
is
addressed
either
in
terms
or
by
necessary
operation
to
civil
actions.
there
has
been
thus
no
retreat
from
the
cobbledick
rule
that
the
cost
and
discomfiture
of
a
trial
even
as
to
a
constitutional
claim
must
be
gone
through
before
the
witness
challenging
a
grand
jury
subpoena
may
bring
that
matter
to
an
appellate
court.
there
is
no
sound
reason,
we
submit,
why
these
principles
should
not
govern
this
case.
we
point
out
again
that
the
question
regarding
control
and
all
other
issues
involved
in
the
july
25
order
will
be
fully
reviewable
on
appeal
if
respondent
is
held
in
contempt.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
find
it
somewhat
mystified.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
and
this
is
set
out
in
precise
language.
it
set
out
at
72
of
the
record
and
they
said,
“none
of
the
cases
cited
had
the
district
court
ordered
anything
other
than
compliance
with
the
subpoena.
in
contrast,
the
district
court
here
modified
the
subpoena
with
respect
to
certain
documents
and
directed
the
appellant
to
undertake
steps
in
a
foreign
country
to
have
those
documents
released
by
other
persons
for
transportation
to
this
country
or
for
inspection
in
kenya
by
united
states
agents.
in
directing
that
affirmative
action
be
taken
in
another
country,
the
district
court
did
more
than
deny
a
motion
to
quash.
it
in
effect
granted
a
mandatory
injunction,
which
given
full-effect,
would
require
action
by
officials
of
the
kenyan
government.”
my
answer
is
to
that
i
don’t
know
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
question
of
appealability.
the
court
simply,
it
seems
to
me,
by
calling
an
order
of
a
court
which
has
complete
control
over
the
grand
jury
process.
the
grand
jury
has
no
authority
to
subpoena
documents
without
the
authority
of
the
court.
and
the
court
has
full
authority
to
modify
and
change,
if
a
court
is
limited
by
the
notion
that
any
modification
which
might
have
some
affirmative
effect,
will
result
in
appealability,
we
think
that
the
courts
will
be
hesitant
to
do
what
they
should
do,
modify,
change
subpoenas
of
grand
juries.
i
see
nothing
in
the
fact
that
it
in
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
nor
in
the
cases
which
it
cites
which
takes
this
out
of
the
cobbledick
rule.
if
this
takes
it
out
of
the
cobbledick
rule,
then
i
don’t
know
why
a
subpoena
directing
production
of
documents,
for
example
which
are
located
in
new
york
city,
which
are
sought
by
a
grand
jury
sitting
in
central
district
of
california,
is
similarly
not
outside
the
cobbledick
rule.
the
problem
here,
it
seems
to
me
is
that
there’s
no
sound
basis
for
continued
adherence
to
cobbledick
if
one
can
simply
by
talking
about
affirmative
directions
of
an
order
transform
that
into
a
1292
(a)
(1)
injunction.
the
history
of
1292
(a)
(1),
neither
the
history
of
1292
(a)
(1)
nor
its
application
by
this
court
in
the
bollinger
case,
switzerland
cheese
association
case
have
indicated
--
has
indicated
that
even
in
civil
actions,
the
court
has
been
not
prone
to
apply
that
provision
except
where
there
is
truly
an
injunction,
and
here,
i
think
to
talk
about
this
being
an
injunction
in
terms
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
would
hamper
and
to
make
it
quite
easy,
to
avoid
the
grand
jury
investigation.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
far
as
i
know,
the
july
25th
order
was
based
upon
the
subpoena
because
it
part
one
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
mr.
jerome
feit
no.
the
order
of
july
25th,
what
that
did
was,
it
took
the
subpoena
and
in
our
view
eased
the
burdens
of
compliance.
it
transformed
the
subpoena
into
a
different
kind
of
a
document
retaining
the
grand
jury
function
that
it
was
perform,
but
there
are
no
two
independent
documents
now
outstanding.
in
answer
to
your
question
there
will
be
no
basis
for
a
contempt
with
regard
to
the
subpoena
and
then
a
contempt
with
regard
to
the
order.
there
would
be
one
contempt.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
order
did,
yes.
it
told
him
to
apply
the
registrar
of
companies
to
produce
or
permit
removal
from
kenya
a
certain
documents.
if
that
request
were
denied,
he
was
to
permit
agents
and
we
believe
agents
of
the
grand
jury,
an
argument
is
made
here
that
these
records
would
have
been
available
for
the
civil
tax.
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely
and
as
i
say,
my
point
was
that
the
subpoena
issues
through
the
authority
of
the
court
and
the
order
of
the
court,
modifying
the
subpoena,
requiring
affirmative
action,
was
merely
a
clarification
which
made
precise
and
particularized
the
duties
that
the
respondent
was
required
to
perform.
and
it’s
our
view
that
if
that
is
a
mandatory
injunction,
then
any
kind
of
modification
by
a
judge
of
a
subpoena
can
be
classified
the
same
way
and
that
the
policy
decisions
of
cobbledick
and
dibella
can
be
very
easily
avoided.
mr.
jerome
feit
it
was
a
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
duces
tecum.
mr.
jerome
feit
oh,
no.
the
situation
was
this.
the
subpoena
was
served,
as
i
said,
on
march
5,
1968.
a
motion
to
quash
alleging
a
variety
of
grounds
was
made
towards
the
end
of
march
and
thereafter,
the
five
proceedings
which
led
up
to
the
july
25
order,
where
wholly
in
connection
with
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
mr.
jerome
feit
well
we
--
mr.
jerome
feit
i
assume
so
because
any
subpoena
requires
some
affirmative
action
implicit
in
it
or
produce
records,
one
must,
if
he
has
them
in
his
warehouse,
he
must
go
to
the
warehouse
and
get
them.
so
that,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
it
seems
to
me
has
opened
the
door
for
an
easy
way
to
avoid
the
very
significant
requirements
of
cobbledick
and
which
this
court
has
reaffirmed
in
dibella
and
it
is
our
view
that
1292
(a)
(1)
does
not
provide
the
remedy
nor
the
cost
and
delay
argument
that
respondent
makes.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
the
court
exercising
its
authority,
historic
authority
to
promote
the
functioning
of
the
grand
jury.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
should
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
it
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
i’d
like
to
make
two
points.
first,
in
volume
three
of
the
original
record
which
is
here,
i’ll
refer
the
court
to
pages
112
in
which
the
united
states
attorney
makes
it
quite
plain
that
these
records
would
be
used
only
for
the
grand
jury
purpose
that
is
those
who
inspect
the
records
in
kenya.
again,
on
pages
90
and
91,
where
the
district
court
further
makes
it
plain
that
these
records
and
that
the
agents
who
were
to
examine
them
were
agents
in
fact
of
the
grand
jury
and
there
would
be
no
violation
of
rule
6
(e).
it
seems
to
me
that
the
thrust
to
the
argument
here
essentially
is
that
cobbledick
really
should
not
be
followed.
as
we
have
indicated,
there
is
no
question
that
this
issue
would
be
resolved
or
would
be
litigated
on
appeal,
the
validity
to
the
july
25
order.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
it
could
be
reviewed
in
contempt
proceeding.
it
seems
to
us
that
it’s
the
--
that
was
from
april
to
june
25,
1968,
the
issue
of
custody
and
control
was
litigated.
just
like
a
motion
to
suppress
it
seems
to
us,
if
respondent
has
additional
evidence
which
would
suggest
that
he
does
not
have
custody
and
control
as
the
court
in
a
motion
to
suppress
which
had
the
court
to
change
its
mind.
however,
it’s
clear
that
this
is
litigable
on
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jerome
feit
on
appeal
from
the
finding
in
contempt
which
is
precisely
cobbledick
and
precisely
what
this
court
has
reaffirmed
in
cases
since
cobbledick
and
i
may
have
one
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
i
would
assume
that
this
would
--
our
view
would
be.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
the
appeal
from
the
contempt
and
he
--
counsel
refers
to
cases
which
i
don’t
know
of
and
which
he
refers
to
cases
in
which
that
order
of
july
25
would
not
be
reviewable
on
appeal.
he
refers
to
cases,
i
know
of
no
such
cases
involving
grand
jury
subpoenas
and
orders
enforcing
grand
jury
subpoenas.
what
happened
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
is
that,
the
initial
determination
was
made
that
he
had
custody
and
control,
an
opportunity
to
litigate
that
on
five
occasions
from
april
to
july.
i
would
take
it.
it
would
be
something
like
law
of
the
case
not
res
judicata.
quite
clearly,
if
he
could
come
in
and
say
at
that
date,
“i
have
something
new.
i
can
show
you
by
an
evidentiary
basis
that
i
did
not
have
custody
and
control
of
the
records
as
of
the
date
of
july
25th.”
it
seems
to
me,
just
as
in
a
motion
to
suppress
where
the
court
could
reconsider,
the
court
could
say,
“we
reconsider
that,
and
we
find
that
you
do
not
have
control.
therefore,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
contempt.”
the
court
on
the
other
hand
could
well
say,
“you
haven’t
submitted
enough
for
me
to
reopen
this.
i
proceed
with
the
contempt
proceeding.
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.”
and
on
appeal
from
the
contempt
proceeding
quite
clearly,
the
july
25,
1968
order
would
be
subject
to
full
review.
and
again
i
say
counsel
referred
to
some
cases
to
the
contrary,
“i
know
of
none
involving
the
area
of
the
grand
jury
subpoena
and
the
enforcement
thereof
by
the
district
court
order.”
mr.
jerome
feit
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
feit
precisely.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes,
as
it
was
here.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
there’s
no
limitation
--
mr.
jerome
feit
there’s
no
limitation
except
as
i
suggest
that
the
way
the
district
court
runs
the
contempt
proceeding.
the
district
court
can
say,
“i
don’t
know
what
the
evidence
of
control
that
mr.
miller,
might
or
might
not
bring
out,
the
proceedings
leading
up
to
the
july
25
order
were
essentially
arguments
of
counsel
would
some
testimony
but
very
little
and
affidavits
in
produced.
yes,
the
district
court
could
entertain
it
seems
to
me
all
of
these
matters
and
say,
“well,
if
you
have
something
to
show
that
you
didn’t
show
me
before,
that
suggests
that
you
have
no
control,
i’m
going
to
re-litigate
that
matter.
well,
i’m
suggesting
is
whether
the
court
does
or
does
not,
that
issue
would
be
fully
reviewable
on
appeal.
mr.
jerome
feit
thank
you.
