justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was
that
any
jurisdictional
devision
will
be
of
a
very
limited
precedential
value
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
changes?
justice
potter
stewart
really
argument
is
not
as
you
just
stated
that
this
court
should
accept
this
appeal,
but
rather
that
this
court
must
accept
this
appeal,
is
it
not?
and
that
even
though
it
maybe
that
you
could
have
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
to
columbia,
nonetheless
having
appealed
here,
your
submission
is,
as
i
understood
it
from
your
brief,
this
court
has
no
power
now
to
transfer
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
must
accept
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
under
the
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
it
is
a
federal
case,
we
can
hardly
say
does
not
(voice
overlap)
congress,
can
we?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
it
almost
follow
then
on
your
reading
of
the
act
that
whenever
an
abortion
is
performed
by
licensed
physician
in
good
standing,
and
the
mother
survives
in
good
health
then
it's
a
legal
abortion
under
the
statute
as
you
read
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
assume
now
a
licensed
physician
in
good
standing
in
the
profession
that
is
not
under
any
discipline,
not
under
any
cloud,
to
perform
an
abortion,
it
doesn’t
follow
in
your
reading
of
the
statute
that,
that’s
not
a
criminal
act?
justice
potter
stewart
the
doctor
and
his
profession
is
to
take
of
people’s
health.
and
if
he
does
something
and
he’s
a
doctor,
licensed
doctor,
in
good
standing
and
he
does
something
in
the
scope
of
his
profession,
isn’t
there
presumption
that,
he
had
been
following
his
profession.
he
comes
to
my
house
and
treats
me
for
a
cold
and
that's
end
of
it.
he
may
use
good
judgment
or
bad,
but
he’s
following
his
profession.
justice
potter
stewart
well
may
be
this
particular
doctor
thinks
that
a
woman,
let's
assume
she
already
has
six
children,
her
health,
including
her
mental
health
isn’t
--
would
be
impaired
by
having
a
seventh
child,
then
he
performs
the
abortion,
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
i
should
think
that’s
not
a
illegal
act?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you’re
going
through
all
this
rigmarole
is
having
setup
a
defense
in
a
criminal
trial.
i
should
think
the
reading
that
you,
yourself
get
from
the
statute.
from
that
reading,
it
would
follow
that
whenever
a
doctor
in
good
standing
performs
an
abortion,
that’s
the
end
of
it,
it’s
not
a
criminal
act?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
believe,
of
course,
against
the
mother’s
will
or
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
not
agree
that
it
would
follow
from
the
very
fact
that
he
performed
the
abortion
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
had
made
that
judgment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
exercise
of
his
professional
judgment,
experience
and
skill.
justice
potter
stewart
most
of
the
other
states
permit
an
abortion
only
if
the
mother’s
life
is
endangered,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
most
of
these
--
most
of
the
state
criminal
statutes
in
the
abortion
area,
allow
defense
only
if
life
not
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
not
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
that
(voice
overlap)
isn't
that
still
true
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
answer
mr.
justice
white’s
question
who
put
to
you,
isn’t
it
perfectly
permissible
for
your
fellow
counsel
on
the
other
side
to
try
to
support
this
judgment
on
any
basis
that
it
can?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
----
i
thought
you
were
directing
yourself.
justice
potter
stewart
on
vagueness
grounds,
all
of
this
decisions
are
not?
justice
potter
stewart
under
which
provisions
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
liberty
of
what,
not
to
be
deprived
of
life,
of
property,
or
liberty
without
due
process
of
law?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
unrestrained
absolute
liberty
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
liberty
that
cannot
be
taken
away
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
what
the
right
derived
under
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
what
this
really
have
to
do
with
the
right
of
privacy?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
any
constitutional
right
to
woman?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
then
the
right
of
mother,
or
to
be
a
mother
or
not
to
be
mother?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was
that
any
jurisdictional
devision
will
be
of
a
very
limited
precedential
value
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
changes?
justice
potter
stewart
really
argument
is
not
as
you
just
stated
that
this
court
should
accept
this
appeal,
but
rather
that
this
court
must
accept
this
appeal,
is
it
not?
and
that
even
though
it
maybe
that
you
could
have
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
to
columbia,
nonetheless
having
appealed
here,
your
submission
is,
as
i
understood
it
from
your
brief,
this
court
has
no
power
now
to
transfer
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
must
accept
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
under

justice
potter
stewart
the

and
his

is

take

and
if
he
does
something

he’s
a
