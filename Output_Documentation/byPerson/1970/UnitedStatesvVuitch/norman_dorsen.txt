mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
language
of
the
statute
that
mr.
--
that
judge
gesell
found
to
be
unconstitutionally
vague.
now,
we’d
like
to
emphasize
in
turning
to
the
words
of
the
statute
that
this
is
the
only
case
we
know
of
in
which
the
professional
judgment
of
a
physician
is
being
second
guessed
by
the
police,
by
a
judge
or
jury
in
the
exercise
of
his
medical
judgment.
but
the
language
of
the
statutes
permits
an
abortion
to
be
made,
if
it’s
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother.
in
our
position,
every
term
in
that
statute
is
impermissibly
vague
and
cannot
support
the
criminal
indictment.
the
word
“preserve”
was
discussed
at
great
length
in
the
bello’s
opinion
in
the
california
supreme
court
in
which
judge
peters
in
the
first
case
reaching
the
conclusion
of
the
statute
of
this
kind
was
unconstitutionally
vague,
pointed
out
that
can
be
subjected
to
at
least
two
meanings,
preserving
life
or
a
health
in
the
abstract
or
maintaining
the
status
quo.
the
word
“necessary”
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
doctor
is
attempting
to
preserve
the
life
of
this
particular
individual
as
distinguished
from
the
person’s
health
at
a
particular
time.
the
word
“necessary”
was
commented
on
by
chief
justice
taft
as
long
ago
as
1926
in
the
trinidad
case
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
in
which
he
said
it’s
a
word
of
great
indefiniteness
and
it’s
objectionable
in
a
criminal
statute.
the
phrase
“necessary
to
preserve
life”
taken
in
this
statute
as
in
many
other
statutes
that
have
been
ruled
upon
by
district
courts
and
supreme
courts
throughout
country,
lay
down
no
standard
by
which
the
term
can
be
applied.
does
the
phrase
“necessary
to
preserve
life”
mean
that
it
is
likely
that
death
will
occur,
that
death
is
eminent,
that
death
is
possible?
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
sir.
it’s
the
brief
for
the
milan
vuitch
signed
by
messer’s
sitnic,
nellis
and
lucas.
the
statutory
language
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no.
not.
the
statutory
language
is
of
no
help
in
parsing
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
of
no
help
and
there
are
at
least
seven
courts
in
this
country
that
have
already
held
that
similar
language
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
most
of
those
are
cited
in
the
brief,
some
have
been
decided
in
the
succeeding
months.
judges
in
a
variety
of
courts
have
pointed
out
the
anomalous
and
indeed
indefensible
position
that
physicians
are
placed
under
statutes
of
this
kind.
for
example,
one
judge
said
this
would
place
the
physician
in
the
position
of
saying
to
his
patient
that
in
the
exercise
of
his
best
medical
judgment
an
abortion
was
advisable,
but
that
the
law
prevented
him
from
performing
the
same.
judge
neville,
in
an
earlier
stage
of
the
case
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to,
said
in
a
concurring
opinion,
the
case
itself
went
off
on
the
jurisdictional
ground,
but
judge
neville
said
i
subscribe
to
the
view
that
the
entire
medical
profession
an
innumerable
pregnant
women
live
under
sword
of
damocles.
the
exercise
of
their
best
medical
judgment,
the
giving
of
advice
and
the
pregnant
women’s
freedom
of
choice
is
chilled
by
the
cloud
of
a
statute
which
renders
their
actions
illegal.
similar
language,
similar
conclusions
can
be
found
in
several
other
cases.
now
if
the
word
“life”
which
has
been
the
subject
of
most
of
the
decisions
to
date
is
vague
'necessary
to
preserve
life,”
the
word
“health”
is
innumerably
vaguer.
there
is
no
possible
standard
that
can
be
derived
from
the
language
of
the
statute
it
seems
to
us
which
can
give
meaning
and
concreteness
to
that
phrase.
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
there
is
a
risk
to
the
health
of
the
patient?
how
great
must
be
the
danger
be
is
one
taken
to
effect
the
nature
of
the
operation?
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
person’s
mental
health,
the
effect
upon
her
family,
upon
her
marriage?
in
this
connection
i
would
merely
refer
to
at
recent
article
which
appeared
in
the
alabama
law
review
in
the
summer
of
1970,
it’s
not
sited
in
the
brief,
but
an
article
by
clifton
meder,
the
dean
of
the
alabama
medical
school
and
titled
“the
mind
of
the
physician”
pointed
out
to
a
legal
audience.
uncertainty
is
the
part
of
the
life
of
every
physician
and
he
goes
on
to
give
numerous
examples
of
how
its
impossible
frequently
for
diagnosis,
for
medical
judgment
to
be
solidly
based.
he
gives
numerous
examples
of
situations
where
precision
is
low
in
his
language
and
error
is
likely.
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
unfortunately
often
in
his
own
apprised
medical
uncertainty,
medicine
and
law
are
brought
together.
what
may
appear
to
be
negligence
to
a
patient
or
lawyer
may
in
fact
be
the
reasonable
decisions
of
a
physician
dealing
with
a
large
amount
of
uncertainty,
either
in
a
diagnosis
or
the
treatment
of
a
disease.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i
would
say
that
malpractice
which
of
course
an
important
problem
to
physicians,
perhaps
as
important
to
problem
as
this,
raises
a
different
question.
it
raises
the
question
whether
or
not
a
physician
is
living
up
to
the
standards
of
his
profession.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
criminal
statute
which
forces
him
to
guess
what
the
word
“health”
means
and
it
puts
him
in
a
wholly
different
position
for
a
man
who
is
being
judged
against
the
standard
of
the
profession.
for
example
in
this
case,
just
to
amplify
that
point,
there
is
no
suggestion
as
far
as
i
know
that
dr.
vuitch
did
not
live
up
to
the
standards
of
his
profession
in
terms
of
care,
in
terms
of
exercise
of
the
normal
physician’s
skills.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that‘s
right
and
i
think
it
applies
to
doctors
who
take
on
the
burden
of
making
a
medical
judgment
and
be
forced
to
--
in
the
face
of
the
statute
at
this
kind?
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
may
do
so
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
fair
question
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
there
is
this
difference.
only
in
this
type
of
operation,
is
there
a
criminal
statute
which
puts
the
issue
as
flatly
as
it
is
put
here,
in
the
case
that
you
mentioned
and
the
cases
i
take
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
discussing.
a
man,
a
doctor
as
i
understand
it,
must
depart
grossly
from
the
proper
standards
of
his
profession
before
he
can
be
criminally
liable.
in
this
statute,
there
is
no
indication
at
all
that
what
the
standard
is.
he
just
says
“preserve
the
life
for
health
of
the
patient.”
there
is
one
other
factor
here.
in
all
of
these
statutes
the
doctor
is
put
in
the
position
where
because
he
maybe
afraid
of
the
very
type
thing
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
you
both
referred
to,
he
is
acting,
he
is
bound
to
act
in
many
situations
inconsistently
with
the
interest
of
the
patient.
he
wants
to
stay
clear
of
the
zone
where
he
might
be
put
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
he
will
not
be
prosecuted,
and
therefore,
he
may
stay
as
hand.
he
may
refrain
from
exercising
what
would
ordinarily
be
his
medical
judgment
because
he
doesn’t
want
to
take
the
risk
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
if
a
jury
or
a
prosecutor
second
guessed
him.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
difference
is
in
the
standard.
the
malpractice
cases
as
i
understand
the
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
difference
i
think
is,
the
difference
i
think
is,
that
in
the
malpractice
case
there
is
a
well
established
standard
by
which
the
professional
judgment
of
the
physician
is
being
evaluated.
this
statute
neither
in
its
history
nor
in
its
language
suggests
what
that
standard
is.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
perhaps
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
think
in
most
cases
that
will
be
a
realistic.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it
is.
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
white
in
order
for
a
doctor
to
be
suspended,
he
would
have
to
depart
grossly
from
the
standards
of
his
profession.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
right.
the
suspension
of
course
would
not
be
a
criminal
offense,
i
might
add
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
might
add,
i
am
not
sure
our
brief
covers
this
fully,
but
to
indicate
the
difference
between
the
conventional
malpractice
situation
and
the
very
special
kind
of
situation
that
physicians
are
faced
with
here
that
this
past
summer,
both
the
american
medical
association
and
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologist,
as
well
as
the
american
public
health
association
all
voted
in
favor
of
having
criminal
penalties
for
abortions
removed.
in
other
words,
what
i’m
suggesting
is
that
the
physician
who
takes
it
upon
himself
to
operate
on
a
woman
in
the
abortion
context
is
not
departing
from
what
seem
to
be
the
present
standards
of
the
medical
profession
as
recently
stated,
this
past
summer
in
one
case
i
think
it
was
in
june
and
in
one
case
it
was
in
august.
now
i
think
training
to
a
point
that
the
government
stressed
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
we
are
making
--
they
certainly
do
have
significance,
and
we
are
making
no
suggestion,
i
hope
none
has
read
into
what
even
mr.
nellies
or
i
said
regarding
the
continued
applicability
of
professional
standards.
we
feel
these
should
be
applied.
what
we
are
speaking
about
is,
is
the
criminal
law
coming
in
this
context
with
a
vague
criminal
statute
and
imposing
an
additional
sanction
to
the
one
that
you've
talked
about,
and
the
one
mr.
justice
white
has
talked
about.
mr.
norman
dorsen
a
further
consequence
of
statutes
of
this
kind
is
what
seems
to
be
the
unfortunate
application
of
the
laws
concerning
abortion
in
a
way
which
operates
differently
against
the
poor
from
the
rich.
the
statistics
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
are
cited
in
our
briefs
and
are
found
in
medical
journals
with
respect
to
other
jurisdictions,
suggest
that
in
the
wards
where
people
without
funds
get
their
medical
treatment,
the
number
of
abortions
that
are
performed
is
significantly
less,
frequently
one-fifth
has
many,
has
in
private
divisions.
now
i
mention
this,
even
though
the
facts
are
not
here
in
the
record,
because
there
is
a
case
that
was
decided
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
doe
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
doe
v.
dc
general
hospital
which
indicates
the
special
problems
of
poor
people
in
getting
an
abortion.
a
second
important,
perhaps
ultimately
decisive
factor
here,
is
the
consideration
that
judge
gesell
did
allude
to,
did
not
decide,
but
did
allude
to
and
that
is
the
right
of
women
to
have
an
abortion.
underline
this
case
in
our
judgment
is
a
basic
constitutional
right
recognized
by
judge
gesell,
although
he
did
not
rule
on
the
point
specifically,
and
by
courts
in
many
other
jurisdictions
that
it
is
a
right
of
a
women
to
make
her
own
decision,
unaffected
by
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
could
myself
not
taking
firm
position
on
that.
we
are
not
making
the
claim
of
any
stage
in
this
case.
certainly
we
would
say
up
to
the
point
where
the
embryo
was
viable,
that
we
wouldn't,
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
know
that
further
in
that
here
and
and
i
would
decline
to
do
so.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon,
i
didn't
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
as
far
as
vagueness
is
concerned
but
not
in
the
terms
of
ultimate
question
of
whether
or
not
a
woman
is
entitled
to
abortion
at
every
point
up
to
birth.
the
text
books
on
the
subject
as
i
understand
once
the
embryo
reaches
a
certain
stage,
they
don't
even
call
it
an
abortion,
they
call
it
induced
labor,
and
becomes
a
somewhat
different
medical
problem
as
i
understand
it.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
now
that
is
a
question
i
would
not
have
an
answer
to
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
it
is.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
and
we
are
making
the
claim
as
spelled
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
that
certainly
up
to
the
traditional
lines
of
20,
22,
24
weeks
that
is
a
right
of
a
woman
to
have
an
abortion.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct
sir.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i
would
rely
on
the
liberty
of
the
women
in
the
federal
case
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct
and
if
our
position
more
explicitly
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
if
there
is
--
if
there
were
a
compelling
state
interest,
which
the
state
could
come
forward
with
to
justify
a
restriction
on
this
fundamental
right,
you
might
have
a
different
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
right
comes
from
the
liberty
of
the
individual
or
for
example,
cases
like
skinner
in
oklahoma,
specifically
talked
about
the
right
to
bear
a
child,
meyer
in
nebraska
discusses
that,
then
of
course
there
are
other
privacy
cases,
the
griswold
case
which
at
great
length
in
three
opinions
on
prevailing
side,
discuss
of
the
right
of
privacy.
the
position
in
other
words,
is
a
position
based
upon
both
the
right
of
privacy
and
liberty
of
the
woman.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
suggest
that
if
a
woman
wishes
to
have
to
use
of
her
body
in
a
way
which
would
mean
disposing
up
the
embryo
that,
that
is
a
choice
that
she
can
make,
and
that
the
doctor
in
the
exercise
of
his
professional
judgment
can
make
upon
her
request
without
the
intervention
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it's
certainly
related
to
that,
but
if
in
the
more
narrow
sense,
it's
the
use
of
the
woman's
body,
which
she
has
the
domain
over
and
which
this
court
should
protect.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i've
given
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
that
and
i
reluctantly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
the
women’s
right
and
not
the
father's
right.
that
it
is
her
body,
and
that
she
should
have
the
right
to
make
the
awesome
decision
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
myself
not
use
the
word
delegate,
she
could
consult
the
physician.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
permit
the
doctor
to
make
that
judgment
against
the
woman’s
will.
she
is
the
one
who
makes
the
decision,
just
as
a
client.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
not
sure.
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
it
would,
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
may
well
be
such
a
statute.
i
don't
think
that
this
case
even
presents
the
same
type
of
problem.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
–
a
human
being
in
the
same
sense
as
a
suicide
case
suggests.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
if
the
doctor
is
exercising
medical
judgment,
if
there
is
a
disease
situation,
if
there
is
a
situation
where
he
would
feel
that
he
should
do
it,
i
then
would
say
that
she
could
do
so
in
unrestrained
way.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
do
have
problems
with
that,
i
do
have
problems
with
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
take
the
position
because
the
abortion
is
a
well
recognized
medical
operation
and
that
the
operation
without
any
indication
at
all
perhaps
traces
out
the
question.
i
would
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
think
that
this
court
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
i
might
say
in
connection
with
the
very
point
that's
been
raised
here
that
mr.
justice
clark,
now
retired,
in
article
in
the
loyola
law
review,
2
loyola
bar
review,
dealt
with
the
some
of
the
same
problems
that
are
before
the
court
now
and
he
concluded
after
discussing
the
issue,
saying,
i
submit
that
until
the
time
that
life
is
present,
the
state
could
not
interfere
with
the
interruption
of
pregnancy
through
abortion
performed
in
a
hospital
or
under
appropriate
clinical
conditions.
and
he
discusses
the
argument
that
amicus
curiae
supporting
the
government's
position
here,
take
and
concludes
that
their
arguments
are
without
foundation.
he
discusses
it
at
length
and
i
won't
repeat
his
argument
except
to
say
one
more
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
no,
no.
what
he
says
and
i
think
i
can
quote
the
relevant
passage
very
briefly
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
"to
say
that
life
is
present
at
conception,
is
to
give
recognition
to
the
potential
rather
than
the
actual.
the
unfertilized
egg
has
life
and
if
fertilized
it
takes
on
human
proportion,
but
the
law
deals
in
reality
not
obscurely,
the
known
rather
than
the
unknown."
in
other
words
his
position
is
not
that
there
is
no
life,
but
that
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
the
court
should
approach
the
problem.
that
we
do
not
know
that
people
have
different
philosophical
and
theological
attitudes
towards
this
subject,
but
they
should
not
be
determinative
once
a
decision
is
made
by
a
woman.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
should
be
determined
on
the
medical
branch
(ph).
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
mr.
justice,
among
other
cases,
it
does.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i've
been
prepared,
but
--
i
suppose
it's
because
it's
cited
frequently
in
the
brief
almost
every
page,
but
i
would
like
to
go
back
in
concluding.
i
wouldn't
want
to
suggest
that
by
dealing
with
the
question,
we've
been
discussing
from
the
past
ten
minutes
or
so,
if
i
want
to
get
away
from
the
precise
issue
that
judge
gesell
dealt
with
below.
our
contention
is
that
this
language
is
unconstitutionally
vague,
that
it
cannot
be
cured
and
that
this
court
should
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
language
of
the
statute
that
mr.
--
that
judge
gesell
found
to
be
unconstitutionally
vague.
now,
we’d
like
to
emphasize
in
turning
to
the
words
of
the
statute
that
this
is
the
only
case
we
know
of
in
which
the
professional
judgment
of
a
physician
is
being
second
guessed
by
the
police,
by
a
judge
or
jury
in
the
exercise
of
his
medical
judgment.
but
the
language
of
the
statutes
permits
an
abortion
to
be
made,
if
it’s
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother.
in
our
position,
every
term
in
that
statute
is
impermissibly
vague
and
cannot
support
the
criminal
indictment.
the
word
“preserve”
was
discussed
at
great
length
in
the
bello’s
opinion
in
the
california
supreme
court
in
which
judge
peters
in
the
first
case
reaching
the
conclusion
of
the
statute
of
this
kind
was
unconstitutionally
vague,
pointed
out
that
can
be
subjected
to
at
least
two
meanings,
preserving
life
or
a
health
in
the
abstract
or
maintaining
the
status
quo.
the
word
“necessary”
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
doctor
is
attempting
to
preserve
the
life
of
this
particular
individual
as
distinguished
from
the
person’s
health
at
a
particular
time.
the
word
“necessary”
was
commented
on
by
chief
justice
taft
as
long
ago
as
1926
in
the
trinidad
case
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
in
which
he
said
it’s
a
word
of
great
indefiniteness
and
it’s
objectionable
in
a
criminal
statute.
the
phrase
“necessary
to
preserve
life”
taken
in
this
statute
as
in
many
other
statutes
that
have
been
ruled
upon
by
district
courts
and
supreme
courts
throughout
country,
lay
down
no
standard
by
which
the
term
can
be
applied.
does
the
phrase
“necessary
to
preserve
life”
mean
that
it
is
likely
that
death
will
occur,
that
death
is
eminent,
that
death
is
possible?
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
sir.
it’s
the
brief
for
the
milan
vuitch
signed
by
messer’s
sitnic,
nellis
and
lucas.
the
statutory
language
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no.
not.
the
statutory
language
is
of
no
help
in
parsing
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
of
no
help
and
there
are
at
least
seven
courts
in
this
country
that
have
already
held
that
similar
language
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
most
of
those
are
cited
in
the
brief,
some
have
been
decided
in
the
succeeding
months.
judges
in
a
variety
of
courts
have
pointed
out
the
anomalous
and
indeed
indefensible
position
that
physicians
are
placed
under
statutes
of
this
kind.
for
example,
one
judge
said
this
would
place
the
physician
in
the
position
of
saying
to
his
patient
that
in
the
exercise
of
his
best
medical
judgment
an
abortion
was
advisable,
but
that
the
law
prevented
him
from
performing
the
same.
judge
neville,
in
an
earlier
stage
of
the
case
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to,
said
in
a
concurring
opinion,
the
case
itself
went
off
on
the
jurisdictional
ground,
but
judge
neville
said
i
subscribe
to
the
view
that
the
entire
medical
profession
an
innumerable
pregnant
women
live
under
sword
of
damocles.
the
exercise
of
their
best
medical
judgment,
the
giving
of
advice
and
the
pregnant
women’s
freedom
of
choice
is
chilled
by
the
cloud
of
a
statute
which
renders
their
actions
illegal.
similar
language,
similar
conclusions
can
be
found
in
several
other
cases.
now
if
the
word
“life”
which
has
been
the
subject
of
most
of
the
decisions
to
date
is
vague
'necessary
to
preserve
life,”
the
word
“health”
is
innumerably
vaguer.
there
is
no
possible
standard
that
can
be
derived
from
the
language
of
the
statute
it
seems
to
us
which
can
give
meaning
and
concreteness
to
that
phrase.
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
there
is
a
risk
to
the
health
of
the
patient?
how
great
must
be
the
danger
be
is
one
taken
to
effect
the
nature
of
the
operation?
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
person’s
mental
health,
the
effect
upon
her
family,
upon
her
marriage?
in
this
connection
i
would
merely
refer
to
at
recent
article
which
appeared
in
the
alabama
law
review
in
the
summer
of
1970,
it’s
not
sited
in
the
brief,
but
an
article
by
clifton
meder,
the
dean
of
the
alabama
medical
school
and
titled
“the
mind
of
the
physician”
pointed
out
to
a
legal
audience.
uncertainty
is
the
part
of
the
life
of
every
physician
and
he
goes
on
to
give
numerous
examples
of
how
its
impossible
frequently
for
diagnosis,
for
medical
judgment
to
be
solidly
based.
he
gives
numerous
examples
of
situations
where
precision
is
low
in
his
language
and
error
is
likely.
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
unfortunately
often
in
his
own
apprised
medical
uncertainty,
medicine
and
law
are
brought
together.
what
may
appear
to
be
negligence
to
a
patient
or
lawyer
may
in
fact
be
the
reasonable
decisions
of
a
physician
dealing
with
a
large
amount
of
uncertainty,
either
in
a
diagnosis
or
the
treatment
of
a
disease.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i
would
say
that
malpractice
which
of
course
an
important
problem
to
physicians,
perhaps
as
important
to
problem
as
this,
raises
a
different
question.
it
raises
the
question
whether
or
not
a
physician
is
living
up
to
the
standards
of
his
profession.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
criminal
statute
which
forces
him
to
guess
what
the
word
“health”
means
and
it
puts
him
in
a
wholly
different
position
for
a
man
who
is
being
judged
against
the
standard
of
the
profession.
for
example
in
this
case,
just
to
amplify
that
point,
there
is
no
suggestion
as
far
as
i
know
that
dr.
vuitch
did
not
live
up
to
the
standards
of
his
profession
in
terms
of
care,
in
terms
of
exercise
of
the
normal
physician’s
skills.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that‘s
right
and
i
think
it
applies
to
doctors
who
take
on
the
burden
of
making
a
medical
judgment
and
be
forced
to
--
in
the
face
of
the
statute
at
this
kind?
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
he
may
do
so
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
fair
question
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
there
is
this
difference.
only
in
this
type
of
operation,
is
there
a
criminal
statute
which
puts
the
issue
as
flatly
as
it
is
put
here,
in
the
case
that
you
mentioned
and
the
cases
i
take
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
discussing.
a
man,
a
doctor
as
i
understand
it,
must
depart
grossly
from
the
proper
standards
of
his
profession
before
he
can
be
criminally
liable.
in
this
statute,
there
is
no
indication
at
all
that
what
the
standard
is.
he
just
says
“preserve
the
life
for
health
of
the
patient.”
there
is
one
other
factor
here.
in
all
of
these
statutes
the
doctor
is
put
in
the
position
where
because
he
maybe
afraid
of
the
very
type
thing
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
you
both
referred
to,
he
is
acting,
he
is
bound
to
act
in
many
situations
inconsistently
with
the
interest
of
the
patient.
he
wants
to
stay
clear
of
the
zone
where
he
might
be
put
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
he
will
not
be
prosecuted,
and
therefore,
he
may
stay
as
hand.
he
may
refrain
from
exercising
what
would
ordinarily
be
his
medical
judgment
because
he
doesn’t
want
to
take
the
risk
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
if
a
jury
or
a
prosecutor
second
guessed
him.
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
difference
is
in
the
standard.
the
malpractice
cases
as
i
understand
the
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
difference
i
think
is,
the
difference
i
think
is,
that
in
the
malpractice
case
there
is
a
well
established
standard
by
which
the
professional
judgment
of
the
physician
is
being
evaluated.
this
statute
neither
in
its
history
nor
in
its
language
suggests
what
that
standard
is.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
perhaps
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
think
in
most
cases
that
will
be
a
realistic.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it
is.
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
white
in
order
for
a
doctor
to
be
suspended,
he
would
have
to
depart
grossly
from
the
standards
of
his
profession.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
right.
the
suspension
of
course
would
not
be
a
criminal
offense,
i
might
add
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
might
add,
i
am
not
sure
our
brief
covers
this
fully,
but
to
indicate
the
difference
between
the
conventional
malpractice
situation
and
the
very
special
kind
of
situation
that
physicians
are
faced
with
here
that
this
past
summer,
both
the
american
medical
association
and
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologist,
as
well
as
the
american
public
health
association
all
voted
in
favor
of
having
criminal
penalties
for
abortions
removed.
in
other
words,
what
i’m
suggesting
is
that
the
physician
who
takes
it
upon
himself
to
operate
on
a
woman
in
the
abortion
context
is
not
departing
from
what
seem
to
be
the
present
standards
of
the
medical
profession
as
recently
stated,
this
past
summer
in
one
case
i
think
it
was
in
june
and
in
one
case
it
was
in
august.
now
i
think
training
to
a
point
that
the
government
stressed
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
we
are
making
--
they
certainly
do
have
significance,
and
we
are
making
no
suggestion,
i
hope
none
has
read
into
what
even
mr.
nellies
or
i
said
regarding
the
continued
applicability
of
professional
standards.
we
feel
these
should
be
applied.
what
we
are
speaking
about
is,
is
the
criminal
law
coming
in
this
context
with
a
vague
criminal
statute
and
imposing
an
additional
sanction
to
the
one
that
you've
talked
about,
and
the
one
mr.
justice
white
has
talked
about.
mr.
norman
dorsen
a
further
consequence
of
statutes
of
this
kind
is
what
seems
to
be
the
unfortunate
application
of
the
laws
concerning
abortion
in
a
way
which
operates
differently
against
the
poor
from
the
rich.
the
statistics
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
are
cited
in
our
briefs
and
are
found
in
medical
journals
with
respect
to
other
jurisdictions,
suggest
that
in
the
wards
where
people
without
funds
get
their
medical
treatment,
the
number
of
abortions
that
are
performed
is
significantly
less,
frequently
one-fifth
has
many,
has
in
private
divisions.
now
i
mention
this,
even
though
the
facts
are
not
here
in
the
record,
because
there
is
a
case
that
was
decided
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
doe
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
doe
v.
dc
general
hospital
which
indicates
the
special
problems
of
poor
people
in
getting
an
abortion.
a
second
important,
perhaps
ultimately
decisive
factor
here,
is
the
consideration
that
judge
gesell
did
allude
to,
did
not
decide,
but
did
allude
to
and
that
is
the
right
of
women
to
have
an
abortion.
underline
this
case
in
our
judgment
is
a
basic
constitutional
right
recognized
by
judge
gesell,
although
he
did
not
rule
on
the
point
specifically,
and
by
courts
in
many
other
jurisdictions
that
it
is
a
right
of
a
women
to
make
her
own
decision,
unaffected
by
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
could
myself
not
taking
firm
position
on
that.
we
are
not
making
the
claim
of
any
stage
in
this
case.
certainly
we
would
say
up
to
the
point
where
the
embryo
was
viable,
that
we
wouldn't,
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
know
that
further
in
that
here
and
and
i
would
decline
to
do
so.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon,
i
didn't
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
as
far
as
vagueness
is
concerned
but
not
in
the
terms
of
ultimate
question
of
whether
or
not
a
woman
is
entitled
to
abortion
at
every
point
up
to
birth.
the
text
books
on
the
subject
as
i
understand
once
the
embryo
reaches
a
certain
stage,
they
don't
even
call
it
an
abortion,
they
call
it
induced
labor,
and
becomes
a
somewhat
different
medical
problem
as
i
understand
it.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
now
that
is
a
question
i
would
not
have
an
answer
to
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
it
is.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
is
and
we
are
making
the
claim
as
spelled
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
that
certainly
up
to
the
traditional
lines
of
20,
22,
24
weeks
that
is
a
right
of
a
woman
to
have
an
abortion.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct
sir.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i
would
rely
on
the
liberty
of
the
women
in
the
federal
case
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct
and
if
our
position
more
explicitly
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
if
there
is
--
if
there
were
a
compelling
state
interest,
which
the
state
could
come
forward
with
to
justify
a
restriction
on
this
fundamental
right,
you
might
have
a
different
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
right
comes
from
the
liberty
of
the
individual
or
for
example,
cases
like
skinner
in
oklahoma,
specifically
talked
about
the
right
to
bear
a
child,
meyer
in
nebraska
discusses
that,
then
of
course
there
are
other
privacy
cases,
the
griswold
case
which
at
great
length
in
three
opinions
on
prevailing
side,
discuss
of
the
right
of
privacy.
the
position
in
other
words,
is
a
position
based
upon
both
the
right
of
privacy
and
liberty
of
the
woman.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
suggest
that
if
a
woman
wishes
to
have
to
use
of
her
body
in
a
way
which
would
mean
disposing
up
the
embryo
that,
that
is
a
choice
that
she
can
make,
and
that
the
doctor
in
the
exercise
of
his
professional
judgment
can
make
upon
her
request
without
the
intervention
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
it's
certainly
related
to
that,
but
if
in
the
more
narrow
sense,
it's
the
use
of
the
woman's
body,
which
she
has
the
domain
over
and
which
this
court
should
protect.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i've
given
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
that
and
i
reluctantly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
the
women’s
right
and
not
the
father's
right.
that
it
is
her
body,
and
that
she
should
have
the
right
to
make
the
awesome
decision
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
myself
not
use
the
word
delegate,
she
could
consult
the
physician.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
not
permit
the
doctor
to
make
that
judgment
against
the
woman’s
will.
she
is
the
one
who
makes
the
decision,
just
as
a
client.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes,
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
not
sure.
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
it
would,
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
may
well
be
such
a
statute.
i
don't
think
that
this
case
even
presents
the
same
type
of
problem.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
–
a
human
being
in
the
same
sense
as
a
suicide
case
suggests.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
think
if
the
doctor
is
exercising
medical
judgment,
if
there
is
a
disease
situation,
if
there
is
a
situation
where
he
would
feel
that
he
should
do
it,
i
then
would
say
that
she
could
do
so
in
unrestrained
way.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
do
have
problems
with
that,
i
do
have
problems
with
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
i
take
the
position
because
the
abortion
is
a
well
recognized
medical
operation
and
that
the
operation
without
any
indication
at
all
perhaps
traces
out
the
question.
i
would
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don't
think
that
this
court
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
right.
i
might
say
in
connection
with
the
very
point
that's
been
raised
here
that
mr.
justice
clark,
now
retired,
in
article
in
the
loyola
law
review,
2
loyola
bar
review,
dealt
with
the
some
of
the
same
problems
that
are
before
the
court
now
and
he
concluded
after
discussing
the
issue,
saying,
i
submit
that
until
the
time
that
life
is
present,
the
state
could
not
interfere
with
the
interruption
of
pregnancy
through
abortion
performed
in
a
hospital
or
under
appropriate
clinical
conditions.
and
he
discusses
the
argument
that
amicus
curiae
supporting
the
government's
position
here,
take
and
concludes
that
their
arguments
are
without
foundation.
he
discusses
it
at
length
and
i
won't
repeat
his
argument
except
to
say
one
more
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that's
correct.
no,
no.
what
he
says
and
i
think
i
can
quote
the
relevant
passage
very
briefly
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
"to
say
that
life
is
present
at
conception,
is
to
give
recognition
to
the
potential
rather
than
the
actual.
the
unfertilized
egg
has
life
and
if
fertilized
it
takes
on
human
proportion,
but
the
law
deals
in
reality
not
obscurely,
the
known
rather
than
the
unknown."
in
other
words
his
position
is
not
that
there
is
no
life,
but
that
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
the
court
should
approach
the
problem.
that
we
do
not
know
that
people
have
different
philosophical
and
theological
attitudes
towards
this
subject,
but
they
should
not
be
determinative
once
a
decision
is
made
by
a
woman.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it
should
be
determined
on
the
medical
branch
(ph).
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes
mr.
justice,
among
other
cases,
it
does.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
i've
been
prepared,
but
--
i
suppose
it's
because
it's
cited
frequently
in
the
brief
almost
every
page,
but
i
would
like
to
go
back
in
concluding.
i
wouldn't
want
to
suggest
that
by
dealing
with
the
question,
we've
been
discussing
from
the
past
ten
minutes
or
so,
if
i
want
to
get
away
from
the
precise
issue
that
judge
gesell
dealt
with
below.
our
contention
is
that
this
language
is
unconstitutionally
vague,
that
it
cannot
be
cured
and
that
this
court
should
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
