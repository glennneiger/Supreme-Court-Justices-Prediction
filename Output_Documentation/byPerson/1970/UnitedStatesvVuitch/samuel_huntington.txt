mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
court
struck
down
a
major
provision
of
the
district
of
columbia
abortion
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
vague
on
it’s
face.
two
indictments
were
returned
in
the
district
of
columbia,
charging
appellee,
dr.
milan
vuitch
who
was
a
licensed
physician,
with
procuring
or
attempting
to
procure
two
abortions
in
violation
of
section
22-201
of
the
dc
code.
that
section
makes
it
a
crime
to
procure
or
attempt
to
procure
an
abortion
“unless
the
same
were
done
as
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
mother’s
life
or
health.”
appellee’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
was
granted
before
trial
by
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
that
the
quoted
phrase
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
record
does
contain
no
development
whatever
of
any
of
the
facts
bearing
on
the
charges
contained
in
the
indictment.
our
basic
position
in
this
court
is
that
the
district
court
erred
in
striking
down
the
abortion
statue
for
vagueness
on
its
face.
the
result
of
the
court’s
decision,
if
allowed
to
stand,
is
that
there
is
now
no
limitation
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
performance
of
abortions
by
physicians.
we
believe
that
under
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute,
there
is
a
definite
class
of
situations
to
which
the
statute
can
be
applied
without
running
into
vagueness
problems.
for
this
reason,
we
think
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
before
reaching
the
merits
of
the
district
court’s
ruling
however,
there
are
certain
jurisdictional
questions,
which
this
court
has
requested
the
parties
to
brief
and
argue.
they
are
as
follows;
first,
does
this
court
have
jurisdiction
over
this
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
underlying
statute
applies
only
within
the
district
of
columbia.
second,
could
the
government
have
appealed
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
section
23-105
of
the
dc
code.
that
section
gives
the
government
the
same
right
of
appeal
that
is
given
to
the
defendant
and
third
if
the
government
could
have
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
should
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration,
abstain
from
accepting
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
first,
let
me
point
out
two
significant
developments
since
the
time
we
filed
our
brief.
these
are
the
passage
of
the
dc
reform
act
and
the
amendment
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
under
the
dc
court
reform
act
which
became
law,
signed
into
law
last
july
and
it
becomes
effective
february
1
of
this
year,
jurisdiction
over
“any
criminal
case
under
any
law
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
will
by
mid
1972
rest
in
the
superior
court
of
the
district
columbia.
appeals
from
that
court
will
run
to
the
district
court,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
of
course
is
not
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
is
the
court
of
record
and
its
judgments
are
reviewed
by
this
court
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
court
judgments
are
reviewed.
of
more
immediate
impact
and
perhaps
of
conclusive
impact
on
direct
appeals
of
course
is
the
amendment
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
which
abolishes
direct
appeals
to
this
court.
now,
that
does
not
apply
--
it
applies
only
to
cases
begun
and
by
that
we
mean,
we
interpret
that
to
mean
begun
by
indictment,
after
january
2nd
of
this
year
when
the
law
was
signed.
so
that
case
does
not
--
that
law
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
but
the
effect
of
these
two
laws
we
submit
is
to
make
issues,
the
jurisdictional
issues
presented
here
issues
which
do
not
have
ongoing
significance.
well,
turning
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i
believe
it
does
make
a
considerable
amount
of
difference
whether
you
take
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
i
just
mean
that
the
issues
you
decide
here,
the
jurisdictional
issues
will
not
have
overriding
significance
in
the
future.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
the
government’s
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
right,
that
is
true.
well,
turning
to
those
issues
now,
the
old
act
as
it
applies
to
this
case
states
that
an
appeal
maybe
taken
by
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
from
the
district
courts,
direct
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
decision
or
judgment
dismissing
any
indictment
with
such
decision
or
judgment
is
based
upon
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
is
founded.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
right,
yes.
we
believe
that
congress
perhaps
could
have
made
a
distinction
between
statue
applicable
only
within
the
district
of
columbia
and
statutes
of
nationwide
application,
but
the
congress
did
not
make
that
distinction
here?
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that
is
certainly
true.
i
think
an
analogy
can
be
drawn
to
the
review
of
the
challenges
of
state
statutes
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
under
that
statute,
this
court
has
interpreted
the
term
statute
in
that
three-judge
district
court
provision
to
mean
statute
of
statewide
applicability
rather
than
a
local
statute.
we
believe
that
this
distinction
was
not
carried
over
to
the
federal
area
in
the
case
shapiro
against
thompson,
involving
the
welfare
residency
requirements
of
the
district
of
columbia.
there
this
court
interpreted
the
statute
there
28
u.s.c
2282,
which
said
that
a
constitutional
challenge
to
an
act
of
congress
applicable
only
to
the
district
of
columbia
must
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
this
court
decided
that
any
act
of
congress
included
an
act
of
congress
limited
in
application
for
the
district
of
columbia.
now
i
would
suggest
that
at
the
time
of
shapiro
that
perhaps
were
arguments
for
restricting
the
scope
of
that
phrase,
they
were
rejected.
the
court
stated
they
could
see
no
reason
to
draw
that
distinction
and
we
submit
that,
that
is
dispositive
of
this
issue
here.
the
only
other
phrase
in
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
which
we
could
see
would
perhaps
lead
to
some
doubt
as
to
whether
this
court
had
jurisdiction
as
the
the
term
district
court
as
to
whether
that
includes
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
we
have
nothing
to
add
to
what
we
said
in
our
brief
there.
we
concluded
in
our
brief
that
when
the
statute
was
originally
passed,
it
did
not
include
that
term.
it
did
not
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia.
it
was
amended
in
1942
to
specifically
mention
the
dc
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
this
court
that,
that
amendment
had
the
effect
of
making
the
court
of
--
the
criminal
appeals
act
applicable
to
the
district
courts.
we
don’t
believe
that
is
a
substantial
issue.
well,
coming
to
the
second
point
that
is
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
whether
the
government
could
have
taken
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
dc
code
section
23-105.
i'd
point
out
that
that
section
has
been
amended
and
as
of
february
1st
it
is
part
of
the
dc
court
reform
act
as
of
february
1st
it
is
now
23-104
and
the
section
is
reworded
much
more
specific.
we
submit
that
it
doesn’t
have
a
material
effect
on
this
issue.
we
had
assumed
at
the
time
we
brought
appeal
here
that
our
only
choice
was
to
come
to
this
court.
it
was
because
in
carroll
against
united
states,
this
court
reviewed
the
overlap
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
in
the
dc
appeals
provision
and
concluded
that
the
explicit
directions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
will
apply
whether
it
too
might
apply
to
the
same
case.
that
decision,
however,
was
placed
in
doubt,
that
observation
was
placed
in
doubt
by
the
decision
last
spring
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
sweet.
in
that
case,
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
had
been
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
23-105.
the
court
of
appeals
without
determining
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
certified
the
case
to
this
court.
this
court
determined
that
certification
was
inappropriate
because
the
certification
provisions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
were
limited
to
situations
where
the
appeal
had
been
taken
to
the
court
appeals
pursuant
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
and
so
was
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
criminal
appeals
act,
but
in
its
opinion
this
court
noted
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
decided
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
under
23-105,
which
would
at
least
indicate
this
court
thought
there
was
a
possibility
that
it
did.
well,
assuming
that
can
be
said
that,
that
it
can
be
said
that
it
would,
the
question
then
becomes
whether
this
court
should
accept
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
on
the
standing
that
both
statutes
might
apply
to
its
case.
we
submit
that
because
the
criminal
appeals
act
states
that
an
appeal
maybe
taken
by
the
united
states
to
this
court
that
this
is
an
appeal
as
of
right
and
this
court
lacks
discretion
to
reject
--to
refuse
to
take
the
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
only
in
the
very
limited
sense
where
appeals
obviously
lack
merit
or
lack
--
were
not
based
in
a
substantial
federal
question
as
this
court
construed
its
appellate
jurisdiction
to
be
discretion.
mr.
samuel
huntington
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
it
was
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
in
united
states
against
burroughs,
this
court
specifically
said
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we’re
dealing
with
the
statute
as
amended
in
1942.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
that’s
right,
but
i
think
you
have
to
interpret
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
amendments
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
certainly
does
bear
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
in
caroll
acknowledged
the
decision
in
boroughs
and
concluded
that
the
affect
of
the
forty-two
amendment
had
been
to
open
up
direct
appeals
to
this
court
from
the
district
court.
now,
if
this
court
wishes
to
reexamine
those,
the
observations
in
caroll
and
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
hoffman,
certainly
the
provision
of
the
1907
act
is
relevant.
well,
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
district
court’s
ruling,
i’ll
state
again
that
our
basic
position
is
the
district
court
should
not
have
struck
down
the
statue
of
its
face.
we
believe
that
under
any
interpretation
of
the
statute,
there
is
a
distinct
class
of
cases
to
which
it
can
be
validly
applied.
namely,
we
believe
it
be
applied
where
a
doctor
has
made
no
attempt
to
determine
whether
or
not
health
reasons
exist
which
would
justify
an
abortion.
mr.
samuel
huntington
as
far
as
vagueness
is
concerned.
i’m
limiting
my
discussion
right
now
to
the
vagueness
point.
appellee
argues
that
in
view
of
the
constitutional
stature
of
the
rights
that
he
asserts
and
the
impact
which
the
statute
has
on
the
practice
of
medicine,
he
should
be
allowed
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face.
this
court
has
afforded
standing
in
certain
first
amendment
cases
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
and
it’s
presumably
on
these
cases
that
appellee
relies.
of
course,
the
leading
case
in
that
area
is
the
dombrowski
against
pfister
case
where
a
subversive
activity
statute
of
louisiana
was
struck
down
by
this
court.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
the
dombrowski
situation.
we
concede
of
course
the
point
that
appellee
stresses
in
his
brief
that
there
are
many
physicians
in
the
district
of
columbia
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
abortion
statute
and
that
perhaps
many
more
abortions
would
be
performed
if
statute
did
not
exist.
but
by
this
concession,
we
don’t
believe
that
establishes
that
the
rights
asserted
are
of
such
constitutional
significance
that
the
statute
should
be
struck
down
on
its
face.
just
that
comparing
this
case
with
the
dombrowski,
first
the
constitutional
rights
asserted
here
are
novel
and
for
the
most
part
unexplored.
we
submit
they
should
not
be
determined
in
the
abstract.
in
dombrowski
well
established
first
amendments
rights
were
an
issue.
second,
and
as
i
stated
we
believe
there
is
distinct
category
of
cases
this
statute
that
can
validly
be
applied
to.
in
dombrowski
it
is
very
questionable
as
to
whether
that
statute
could
be
applied
to
any
significant
category
of
cases.
finally,
in
dombrowski
the
conduct
of
those
challenging
the
state
statute
was
not
at
the
hardcore
type
which
would
be
prohibited
by
any
reading
of
the
statute.
here,
only
the
development
of
a
record
will
demonstrate
whether
appellee’s
conduct
is
at
the
hardcore
type
of
not.
assuming,
however,
that
the
appellee
should
be
allowed
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
district
court’s
holding
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
is
argued
that
the
district
court
misconstrued
the
statute
and
that
under
a
proper
interpretation
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
vague.
of
great
concerned
to
the
district
court
was
a
possibility
that
a
doctor
would
exercise
medical
judgment
and
determine
that
health
grounds
justify
an
abortion
and
that
this
judgment
would
then
be
subject
to
being
second
guessed
after
the
fact
by
first
the
prosecutor
and
then
the
(inaudible)
the
jury.
this
concern
follow
from
the
court’s
reading
of
the
1943
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
williams
against
united
states.
the
district
court
read
that
case
as
placing
the
burden
on
the
physician
of
persuading
the
jury
that
his
acts
were
necessary.
we
submit
that
williams
did
not
hold
that.
in
the
william’s
case,
neither
side
at
his
trial,
neither
side
introduced
any
evidence
of
justification.
the
sole
issue
in
that
case
was
who
had
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
the
issue,
who
had
the
burden
of
raising
the
issue.
in
affirming
the
conviction,
the
court
of
appeals
merely
held
that
burden
of
raising
justification
has
an
affirmative
defense
was
on
the
physician.
in
our
view,
william
is
consistent
with
the
proposition
that
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
is
on
the
government
and
remains
on
the
government,
once
the
issue
has
been
raised.
the
district
court
--.
mr.
samuel
huntington
if
the
doctor
makes
a
good
faith
judgment,
exercises
his
medical
judgment
that
health
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i
think
we
would
require
that
he
at
least
raised
the
issue
of
whether
he
determined
that
health
grounds
necessitated
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
believe
that
the
doctor
will
have
broad
scope
in
determining
what
health
is,
but
we
would
suggest
that
the
term
health
means
that
he
has
to
make
an
examination
of
the
woman
and
determine
that
for
some
--
that
because
some
condition
of
that
woman
(laughter),
some
condition
beyond
the
mere
fact
that
she
was
pregnant.
i
think
if
the
doctor
merely
determined
that
the
fact
she
was
pregnant
was
sufficient
grounds
for
performing
the
abortion
that,
that
would
raised
in
element
of
good
faith
and
his
good
faith
could
be
place
in
doubt
if
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
if
he
does
conclude
that,
if
he
does
conclude
that
her
mental
health
requires
that
she
have
the
abortion,
then
we
say
you
would
be
protected
as
long
as
that
judgment
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we
don’t
believe
that
would
necessarily
be
true
say
if
have
doctor
who
performs
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh!
of
course,
we
believe
that
if
a
doctor
merely
performed
an
abortion
on
demand,
on
the
woman’s
request,
solely
on
the
woman’s
request
without
determining
that
special
conditions
separate
that
woman
from
the
general
class
of
women,
a
pregnant
woman.
that
special
health
grounds
separate
that
woman
from
the
general
class
of
healthy
pregnant
woman.
we
believe
that
if
a
doctor
merely
because
of
the
fact
of
pregnancy
performs
an
abortion
on
her
request
that
he
would
violate
the
statute
that
he
would
have
to
make
a
good
faith
judgment
that
there
were
special
conditions
pertaining
to
that
woman
within
his
view
jeopardized
her
health,
whether
either
mental
health
or
her
medical
health.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
we
would
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
huntington
no.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
appellee,
appellee
does
argue
that
because
he
cites
the
statistics
to
show
that
the
abortion
operation
at
least
in
the
first
trimester
is
safer
than
proceeding
to
term
undergoing
natural,
regular
child
birth.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
that
type
of
danger
which
the
statute
is
aimed
at.
the
statute
was
passed
at
a
time
when
abortion
was
a
risky
operation.
we
believe
that
certainly
the
standard
health
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
adapted
the
statute,
would
involve
a
risk
to
health
which
would
be
greater
than
the
risk
of
the
abortion
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
they
had
in
mind
fairly
--
they
had
in
mind
complications
which
would
interfere
with
child
birth.
so
we
believe
that
just
the
fact
that
pregnancy
alone
is
insufficient,
if
a
doctor
wee
to
at
his
trial
if
he
were
to
introduce
medical
records
which
showed
that
the
woman
was
pregnant
and
rest
his
case,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
would
be
sufficient
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
but
nothing
more.
mr.
samuel
huntington
not
that
i
know
off.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
this
issue
i
believed
is
it
does
not
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court
as
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
do.
we
believe
that
it
is
reasonable
for
mainly
for
convenience
and
proof
purposes
to
place
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
evidence
on
the
justification
issue
on
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
that’s
true,
yes.
i
don’t
believe
it’s
necessary
to
go
in
with
that.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
at
any
rate
the
district
court
was
afraid
that
a
physician’s
professional
judgment
made
in
good
faith,
the
district
court
stated
that
judgment
should
not
be
challenged
and
we
say
we
agree
and
we
believe
that
the
williams
case
goes
a
long
ways
towards
establishing
a
good
faith
as
a
defense.
we
believe
it
is,
but
a
small
step
for
this
court
to
expand
on
the
williams
holding
and
certainly
this
court
has
the
power,
this
being
a
federal
statute,
this
court
has
the
power
to
construe
the
statute
so
as
to
limit
the
vagueness
attack
on
it.
now,
there
have
been
some
decisions
which
we
have
decided
in
our
brief
where
this
court
has
deferred
on
local
matters
to
the
decisions
of
the
district
courts.
the
case
of
the
district
of
columbia
against
little,
construing
a
search
regulation
of
the
dc
health
code,
this
court
concluded
that
where
statutory
questions
are
so
unmeshed
with
constitutional
issues
that
the
complete
disposition
of
the
case
is
appropriate
for
this
court.
this
is
such
a
case.
in
williams,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
a
decision
should
not
undertake
the
operation
unless
he
is
convinced
in
good
faith
of
its
therapeutic
necessity.
the
court
later
stated
a
competent
physician
who
acts
in
good
faith
will
always
be
in
the
position
to
come
forward
with
the
justification
for
any
operation.
we
do
not
believe
this
is
a
strained
interpretation
of
the
statute,
other
states
have
interpreted
their
statutes
to
allow
good
faith
as
a
defense.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
true.
in
massachusetts
however,
the
abortion
statute
there
has
been
interpreted
to
allow
health
grounds
as
a
justification
and
good
faith
has
been
recognized
there
as
a
defense.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
was
certainly
true
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
certainly
true
three
or
four
years
ago.
there
are
increasing
numbers
of
states
now
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
still
true.
i
think
alabama
is
the
only
one
that
specifically
mentions
health.
as
i
say
massachusetts
has
interpreted
their
statute
to
include
health.
well,
appellee
asserts
here
numerous
other
that
--
numerous
other
constitutional
issues
should
be
decided
by
this
court.
those
claims
were
presented
to
the
district
court,
but
the
district
court
did
not
cite
it.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
district
court
indicated
that
significant
constitutional
rights
were
involved.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
did.
it
certainly
--
it
stated
that
that
there
was
unquestionably
some
impingement
of
rights
involved
here.
now,
it
did
not
go
into
a
way
of
the
zone
of
interest
of
privacy
versus
state
interest
regulating
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we’re
submitting
that
there
are
sound
reasons
for
this
court
not
to
reach
the
issue.
it
reached
those
other
issues.
i
think
first
of
all
this
court
has
often
expressed
policy
against
deciding
constitutional
issues
unless
necessary
for
a
decision
of
a
case.
and
also
the
general
policy
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
to
construe
direct
appeals
narrowly,
but
more
directly,
we
believed
that
the
novel
rights
here
should
not
be
adjudicated
without
the
development
of
a
record.
we
believe
a
record
would
be
helpful
in
this
case,
the
precise
impact
of
the
dc
statute
is
far
from
clear.
mr.
samuel
huntington
he
might.
we
submit
that
the
proper
approach
would
be
to
develop
a
record.
i
think
that
the
questions
raised
which
relate
to
the
right
to
receive
medical
practice
and
the
rights
of
women
to
choose
when
and
whether
to
have
children
that
they’re
asserted
by
appellees
as
absolute
rights.
we
submit
that
the
state
interest
in
regulating
abortion
has
to
be
measured
against
these
absolute
rights
and
that
precisely
what
impact
the
dc
code
has
in
this
area
would
be
better
decided
on
a
specific
context
of
a
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
submit
that
the
issue
in
this
particular
case
is
somewhat
different
then
the
issues
in
most
of
the
other
cases
dealing
with
abortion
statutes.
only
in
--
i
think
it's
doe
v.
bolton,
the
georgia
three-judge
court,
was
a
statute
involved
that
used
the
term
health.
now,
because
under
our
interpretation
the
doctor
is
given
a
broad
scope
to
exercise
medical
judgment.
we
don’t
think
that
it
should
be
permitted
in
the
abstract
that
the
statute
interferes
with
that
--
with
a
basic
right
to
practice
medicine.
but
should
this
court
reach
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issues
here
involved,
i’d
like
to
state
very
briefly
the
government’s
position.
basic
questions
about
when
life
begins
and
when
it
should
be
protected
or
involved
and
underlie
all
of
these
abortion
statutes,
abortion
laws
that
reflect
the
views
of
the
major
segment
of
this
country’s
population,
that
the
embryo
should
be
protected.
contrary
views
of
course
are
held
by
many
people.
in
our
view,
resolution
of
this
very
fundamental
question
is
peculiarly
within
the
province
of
the
legislature.
we
believe
that
the
significance
of
the
medical
data
which
is
referred
to
in
the
amicus
brief
of
dr.
hapenan
(ph)
is
to
show
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
draw
a
line
at
some
stage
during
pregnancy.
the
common
law
drew
the
line
at
quickening
because
it
was
generally
felt
then
that
a
quickening
is
when
the
baby
became
alive.
but
the
--
during
the
19th
century
the
medical
profession
realized
that
was
really
relatively
insignificant.
it
may
have
had
an
effect
on
the
mother,
she
at
that
point
she
realized
that
something
was
moving
inside.
but
that
--
from
a
medical
point
of
view,
from
the
moment
of
conception
on
there
was
a
fairly
steady
development
which
continues
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
argue
that
you
should
not
reach
this
question
of
just
trying
to
state
our
views
just
to
meet
the
possibility
that
you
do
so
you
don’t
think
that
we
do
not
have
any
views
on
the
ultimate
question.
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh!
yes,
if
the
district
court
is
right
on
vagueness
and
of
course
we
don’t
reach
these
issues.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we
believe
it
would
be.
that’s
under
the
dc
code
if
the
mother
does
not
commit
a
crime.
the
codes
interpreted
that
way
and
we
believe
that
this
expresses
the
will
of
congress
in
regulating
abortion
if
it
was
sufficient
to
go
after
the
doctor.
i
believe
that
in
some
states
do
make
laws
do
cover
the
women,
but
because
it's
impossible
to
draw
a
line
here
or
because
it's
very
difficult,
there
is
substantial
medical
evidence.
it's
not
based
solely
on
the
views
of
the
church
as
some
would
contend,
but
it's
based
on
basic
evidence
as
to
what
happens
in
the
development
of
life.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
--
we
submit
that
is
correct.
this
court
should
not
reach
the
merits.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right
and
we
submit
that
there
are
sound
reasons
that
this
court
not
to
reach
the
issue,
but
if
you
do
reach
that
issue.
if
you
do
determine
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it's
not
an
absolute
rule,
there's
no
absolution
prohibition
in
this
court
reaching
these
issues
and
in
some
cases
you
have
reached
issues
which
is
not
yet
decided
by
the
district
court
and
those
are
sited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
statute
does
refer
to
the
health
of
the
mother
and
the
appellee
does
make
the
argument
that
the
statute
was
passed
solely
as
a
health
measure
to
protect
the
health
of
the
mother.
we
submit
that
while
the
legislative
history
of
the
dc
provision
is
indeed
sparse,
i
think
the
only
statement
we
could
determine
with
any
possible
relevance
is
that
the
author
of
the
code
drew
on
the
provisions
of
other
states.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
does
refer
to
the
mother’s
health,
but
by
limiting
abortions
to
instances
where
the
mother’s
health
required
it.
we
submit
that
the
statute
reflects
a
desire
to
protect
fetal
life.
that
if
that
was
not
a
factor
that
a
broader
statute
prohibiting
any
internal
surgery,
unless
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother
would
have
been
more
appropriate.
it
was
during
the
19th
century
in
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
that
most
of
the
laws
regulating
abortion
were
passed
in
the
states.
now,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
right,
many
of
the
other
statutes
passed
refer
only
to
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother.
they
don’t
mention
fetal
life
either.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
by
placing
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
our
position
is
that
the
statue
that
by
regulating
abortion
in
that
way,
prohibiting
it
less
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
mother,
it
reflects
a
judgment
on
behalf
of
congress
that
where
the
mother's
health
doesn’t
require
an
abortion,
the
fetus
should
be
protected.
in
other
words,
if
the
mother
just
wanted
an
abortion
on
demand
that
this
would
not
be
sufficient
and
that
in
that
case,
the
interest
of
the
state
of
protecting
the
fetus
prevails.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
correct,
that’s
the
only
thing
involved,
but
i
think
it
is
relevant
and
i’ll
just
draw
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
correct,
that’s
what
the
statute
states.
i
just
draw
the
court's
attention
in
closing
to
a
discussion
of
this
particular
issue
in
the
essay
by
professors
(inaudible)
and
noonan
in
constitutional
balance
at
pages,
it's
in
the
recent
book
by
noonan
entitled
the
morality
of
abortion
which
is
cited
in
page
36
of
our
brief
and
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
pages
223
to
226
of
that
essay
which
i
think
indicates
a
set
of
background
of
many
of
the
abortion
statutes.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
reminder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
huntington
at
first
i’d
like
to
refer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
blackmun
at
the
end
of
my
argument
that
the
question
of
rubella.
i
think
perhaps
i
was
too
hasty
in
my
response
to
that
question
that
that
would
not
be
grounds
for
an
abortion.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
chance
that
there
maybe
a
defect
in
the
fetus
that
it
quite
possibly
be
that
psychiatric
grounds
would
exist
for
justifying
the
abortion
in
that
case.
obviously,
the
prospect
of
the
raising
a
deform
trial
would
have
a
very
definite
traumatic
effect
on
a
woman
and
i
think
that
would
in
the
room
of
the
psychiatrist
to
determine
precisely
what
that
effect
would
be.
referring
to
the
professor
dorsen’s
attacks
on
the
vagueness
issue
and
mainly
that
it’s
interference
with
the
exercise
of
professional
judgment
by
doctors.
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
the
narrowness
of
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
don’t
believe
the
doctor
will
be
second
guessed
by
a
prosecutor
or
a
jury.
we
believe
that
if
he
in
good
faith
determines
that
health
grounds
exist
that
that
is
the
end
of
it.
i’d
like
to
refer
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
believe
it
is
a
possible
construction
and
the
logical
construction
which
we
are
offering
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
necessary
for
health.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
believe
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
is
that
the
word
health
is
a
medical
test,
in
that
if
a
doctor
concludes
in
good
faith
that
health
grounds
exist
that
that
should
be
the
end.
the
sole
question
before
the
jury
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
don’t
believe
it
would
be
a
crime,
provided
that
he
exercises
the
judgment.
i
just
like
to
point
that
this
statute
is
not
--
that
the
government
does
not
harass
physicians
with
numerous
indictments
that
this
court
is
going
to
be
face
with
the
flooded
cases
involving
the
physicians.
in
the
last
ten
years,
i
believe
something
like
six
or
seven
indictments
have
been
--
six
or
seven
physicians
have
been
prosecuted
in
the
memory
of
the
chief
of
the
us
attorney,
criminal
division.
in
none
of
those
cases
that
did
a
doctor
raise
the
defense
of
good
faith.
the
position
of
the
government
is
to
go
after
doctors
to
limit
the
enforcement
of
the
law
against
doctors
who
do
not
make
medical
judgment
to
perform
abortion
on
demand.
mr.
samuel
huntington
on
demand
without
making
a
determination
in
each
instance
that
health
grounds
exist.
mr.
samuel
huntington
if
he
thinks
that
it’s
in
good
faith,
then
he
is
protected.
if
he
believes
that
the
health
grounds,
that
there
is
some
complication
that
would
raise
a
medical
problem
in
carrying
the
pregnancy
to
term,
or
if
he’s
psychiatrist,
if
the
psychiatrist
concludes
that
the
pregnancy
will
have
a
harmful
effect
to
her
--
to
the
woman’s
mental
well
being
and
they
determine
that
in
good
faith
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
psychiatrist
or
the
doctor,
those
in
medical
tests
and
we
believe
that
their
judgment
on
that
issue
should
be
protected.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we
believe
that
it
can
be
administered
against
those
who
do
not
--
for
against
people
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
think
if
a
physician
said
it
was
in
good
faith
and
it
was
shown
by
the
government
that
at
every
single
case
where
a
woman
requested
an
abortion,
he
performed
it
that
that
would
place
an
issue
his
good
faith
in
meeting
the
grounds
of
the
statute.
mr.
samuel
huntington
a
doctor
was
acquitted?
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i’m
afraid
i’ve
haven’t
determined.
i
haven’t
read
over
the
all
cases
to
determine
that
your
honor.
well,
that’s
the
case
and
if
could
well
be.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
a
medical
judgment
made
in
good
faith.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
huntington
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
court
struck
down
a
major
provision
of
the
district
of
columbia
abortion
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
vague
on
it’s
face.
two
indictments
were
returned
in
the
district
of
columbia,
charging
appellee,
dr.
milan
vuitch
who
was
a
licensed
physician,
with
procuring
or
attempting
to
procure
two
abortions
in
violation
of
section
22-201
of
the
dc
code.
that
section
makes
it
a
crime
to
procure
or
attempt
to
procure
an
abortion
“unless
the
same
were
done
as
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
mother’s
life
or
health.”
appellee’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
was
granted
before
trial
by
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
that
the
quoted
phrase
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
record
does
contain
no
development
whatever
of
any
of
the
facts
bearing
on
the
charges
contained
in
the
indictment.
our
basic
position
in
this
court
is
that
the
district
court
erred
in
striking
down
the
abortion
statue
for
vagueness
on
its
face.
the
result
of
the
court’s
decision,
if
allowed
to
stand,
is
that
there
is
now
no
limitation
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
performance
of
abortions
by
physicians.
we
believe
that
under
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute,
there
is
a
definite
class
of
situations
to
which
the
statute
can
be
applied
without
running
into
vagueness
problems.
for
this
reason,
we
think
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
before
reaching
the
merits
of
the
district
court’s
ruling
however,
there
are
certain
jurisdictional
questions,
which
this
court
has
requested
the
parties
to
brief
and
argue.
they
are
as
follows;
first,
does
this
court
have
jurisdiction
over
this
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
underlying
statute
applies
only
within
the
district
of
columbia.
second,
could
the
government
have
appealed
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
section
23-105
of
the
dc
code.
that
section
gives
the
government
the
same
right
of
appeal
that
is
given
to
the
defendant
and
third
if
the
government
could
have
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
should
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration,
abstain
from
accepting
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
first,
let
me
point
out
two
significant
developments
since
the
time
we
filed
our
brief.
these
are
the
passage
of
the
dc
reform
act
and
the
amendment
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
under
the
dc
court
reform
act
which
became
law,
signed
into
law
last
july
and
it
becomes
effective
february
1
of
this
year,
jurisdiction
over
“any
criminal
case
under
any
law
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia
will
by
mid
1972
rest
in
the
superior
court
of
the
district
columbia.
appeals
from
that
court
will
run
to
the
district
court,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
of
course
is
not
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
is
the
court
of
record
and
its
judgments
are
reviewed
by
this
court
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
court
judgments
are
reviewed.
of
more
immediate
impact
and
perhaps
of
conclusive
impact
on
direct
appeals
of
course
is
the
amendment
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
which
abolishes
direct
appeals
to
this
court.
now,
that
does
not
apply
--
it
applies
only
to
cases
begun
and
by
that
we
mean,
we
interpret
that
to
mean
begun
by
indictment,
after
january
2nd
of
this
year
when
the
law
was
signed.
so
that
case
does
not
--
that
law
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
but
the
effect
of
these
two
laws
we
submit
is
to
make
issues,
the
jurisdictional
issues
presented
here
issues
which
do
not
have
ongoing
significance.
well,
turning
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i
believe
it
does
make
a
considerable
amount
of
difference
whether
you
take
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
i
just
mean
that
the
issues
you
decide
here,
the
jurisdictional
issues
will
not
have
overriding
significance
in
the
future.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
the
government’s
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
right,
that
is
true.
well,
turning
to
those
issues
now,
the
old
act
as
it
applies
to
this
case
states
that
an
appeal
maybe
taken
by
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
from
the
district
courts,
direct
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
decision
or
judgment
dismissing
any
indictment
with
such
decision
or
judgment
is
based
upon
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
is
founded.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
right,
yes.
we
believe
that
congress
perhaps
could
have
made
a
distinction
between
statue
applicable
only
within
the
district
of
columbia
and
statutes
of
nationwide
application,
but
the
congress
did
not
make
that
distinction
here?
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
that
is
certainly
true.
i
think
an
analogy
can
be
drawn
to
the
review
of
the
challenges
of
state
statutes
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
under
that
statute,
this
court
has
interpreted
the
term
statute
in
that
three-judge
district
court
provision
to
mean
statute
of
statewide
applicability
rather
than
a
local
statute.
we
believe
that
this
distinction
was
not
carried
over
to
the
federal
area
in
the
case
shapiro
against
thompson,
involving
the
welfare
residency
requirements
of
the
district
of
columbia.
there
this
court
interpreted
the
statute
there
28
u.s.c
2282,
which
said
that
a
constitutional
challenge
to
an
act
of
congress
applicable
only
to
the
district
of
columbia
must
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
this
court
decided
that
any
act
of
congress
included
an
act
of
congress
limited
in
application
for
the
district
of
columbia.
now
i
would
suggest
that
at
the
time
of
shapiro
that
perhaps
were
arguments
for
restricting
the
scope
of
that
phrase,
they
were
rejected.
the
court
stated
they
could
see
no
reason
to
draw
that
distinction
and
we
submit
that,
that
is
dispositive
of
this
issue
here.
the
only
other
phrase
in
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
which
we
could
see
would
perhaps
lead
to
some
doubt
as
to
whether
this
court
had
jurisdiction
as
the
the
term
district
court
as
to
whether
that
includes
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
we
have
nothing
to
add
to
what
we
said
in
our
brief
there.
we
concluded
in
our
brief
that
when
the
statute
was
originally
passed,
it
did
not
include
that
term.
it
did
not
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia.
it
was
amended
in
1942
to
specifically
mention
the
dc
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
this
court
that,
that
amendment
had
the
effect
of
making
the
court
of
--
the
criminal
appeals
act
applicable
to
the
district
courts.
we
don’t
believe
that
is
a
substantial
issue.
well,
coming
to
the
second
point
that
is
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
whether
the
government
could
have
taken
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
dc
code
section
23-105.
i'd
point
out
that
that
section
has
been
amended
and
as
of
february
1st
it
is
part
of
the
dc
court
reform
act
as
of
february
1st
it
is
now
23-104
and
the
section
is
reworded
much
more
specific.
we
submit
that
it
doesn’t
have
a
material
effect
on
this
issue.
we
had
assumed
at
the
time
we
brought
appeal
here
that
our
only
choice
was
to
come
to
this
court.
it
was
because
in
carroll
against
united
states,
this
court
reviewed
the
overlap
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
in
the
dc
appeals
provision
and
concluded
that
the
explicit
directions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
will
apply
whether
it
too
might
apply
to
the
same
case.
that
decision,
however,
was
placed
in
doubt,
that
observation
was
placed
in
doubt
by
the
decision
last
spring
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
sweet.
in
that
case,
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
had
been
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
23-105.
the
court
of
appeals
without
determining
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
certified
the
case
to
this
court.
this
court
determined
that
certification
was
inappropriate
because
the
certification
provisions
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
were
limited
to
situations
where
the
appeal
had
been
taken
to
the
court
appeals
pursuant
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
and
so
was
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
criminal
appeals
act,
but
in
its
opinion
this
court
noted
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
decided
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
under
23-105,
which
would
at
least
indicate
this
court
thought
there
was
a
possibility
that
it
did.
well,
assuming
that
can
be
said
that,
that
it
can
be
said
that
it
would,
the
question
then
becomes
whether
this
court
should
accept
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
on
the
standing
that
both
statutes
might
apply
to
its
case.
we
submit
that
because
the
criminal
appeals
act
states
that
an
appeal
maybe
taken
by
the
united
states
to
this
court
that
this
is
an
appeal
as
of
right
and
this
court
lacks
discretion
to
reject
--to
refuse
to
take
the
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
only
in
the
very
limited
sense
where
appeals
obviously
lack
merit
or
lack
--
were
not
based
in
a
substantial
federal
question
as
this
court
construed
its
appellate
jurisdiction
to
be
discretion.
mr.
samuel
huntington
right.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
it
was
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
in
united
states
against
burroughs,
this
court
specifically
said
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we’re
dealing
with
the
statute
as
amended
in
1942.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
that’s
right,
but
i
think
you
have
to
interpret
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
amendments
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it
certainly
does
bear
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
in
caroll
acknowledged
the
decision
in
boroughs
and
concluded
that
the
affect
of
the
forty-two
amendment
had
been
to
open
up
direct
appeals
to
this
court
from
the
district
court.
now,
if
this
court
wishes
to
reexamine
those,
the
observations
in
caroll
and
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
hoffman,
certainly
the
provision
of
the
1907
act
is
relevant.
well,
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
district
court’s
ruling,
i’ll
state
again
that
our
basic
position
is
the
district
court
should
not
have
struck
down
the
statue
of
its
face.
we
believe
that
under
any
interpretation
of
the
statute,
there
is
a
distinct
class
of
cases
to
which
it
can
be
validly
applied.
namely,
we
believe
it
be
applied
where
a
doctor
has
made
no
attempt
to
determine
whether
or
not
health
reasons
exist
which
would
justify
an
abortion.
mr.
samuel
huntington
as
far
as
vagueness
is
concerned.
i’m
limiting
my
discussion
right
now
to
the
vagueness
point.
appellee
argues
that
in
view
of
the
constitutional
stature
of
the
rights
that
he
asserts
and
the
impact
which
the
statute
has
on
the
practice
of
medicine,
he
should
be
allowed
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face.
this
court
has
afforded
standing
in
certain
first
amendment
cases
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
and
it’s
presumably
on
these
cases
that
appellee
relies.
of
course,
the
leading
case
in
that
area
is
the
dombrowski
against
pfister
case
where
a
subversive
activity
statute
of
louisiana
was
struck
down
by
this
court.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
the
dombrowski
situation.
we
concede
of
course
the
point
that
appellee
stresses
in
his
brief
that
there
are
many
physicians
in
the
district
of
columbia
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
abortion
statute
and
that
perhaps
many
more
abortions
would
be
performed
if
statute
did
not
exist.
but
by
this
concession,
we
don’t
believe
that
establishes
that
the
rights
asserted
are
of
such
constitutional
significance
that
the
statute
should
be
struck
down
on
its
face.
just
that
comparing
this
case
with
the
dombrowski,
first
the
constitutional
rights
asserted
here
are
novel
and
for
the
most
part
unexplored.
we
submit
they
should
not
be
determined
in
the
abstract.
in
dombrowski
well
established
first
amendments
rights
were
an
issue.
second,
and
as
i
stated
we
believe
there
is
distinct
category
of
cases
this
statute
that
can
validly
be
applied
to.
in
dombrowski
it
is
very
questionable
as
to
whether
that
statute
could
be
applied
to
any
significant
category
of
cases.
finally,
in
dombrowski
the
conduct
of
those
challenging
the
state
statute
was
not
at
the
hardcore
type
which
would
be
prohibited
by
any
reading
of
the
statute.
here,
only
the
development
of
a
record
will
demonstrate
whether
appellee’s
conduct
is
at
the
hardcore
type
of
not.
assuming,
however,
that
the
appellee
should
be
allowed
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
district
court’s
holding
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
is
argued
that
the
district
court
misconstrued
the
statute
and
that
under
a
proper
interpretation
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
vague.
of
great
concerned
to
the
district
court
was
a
possibility
that
a
doctor
would
exercise
medical
judgment
and
determine
that
health
grounds
justify
an
abortion
and
that
this
judgment
would
then
be
subject
to
being
second
guessed
after
the
fact
by
first
the
prosecutor
and
then
the
(inaudible)
the
jury.
this
concern
follow
from
the
court’s
reading
of
the
1943
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
williams
against
united
states.
the
district
court
read
that
case
as
placing
the
burden
on
the
physician
of
persuading
the
jury
that
his
acts
were
necessary.
we
submit
that
williams
did
not
hold
that.
in
the
william’s
case,
neither
side
at
his
trial,
neither
side
introduced
any
evidence
of
justification.
the
sole
issue
in
that
case
was
who
had
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
the
issue,
who
had
the
burden
of
raising
the
issue.
in
affirming
the
conviction,
the
court
of
appeals
merely
held
that
burden
of
raising
justification
has
an
affirmative
defense
was
on
the
physician.
in
our
view,
william
is
consistent
with
the
proposition
that
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
is
on
the
government
and
remains
on
the
government,
once
the
issue
has
been
raised.
the
district
court
--.
mr.
samuel
huntington
if
the
doctor
makes
a
good
faith
judgment,
exercises
his
medical
judgment
that
health
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i
think
we
would
require
that
he
at
least
raised
the
issue
of
whether
he
determined
that
health
grounds
necessitated
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
believe
that
the
doctor
will
have
broad
scope
in
determining
what
health
is,
but
we
would
suggest
that
the
term
health
means
that
he
has
to
make
an
examination
of
the
woman
and
determine
that
for
some
--
that
because
some
condition
of
that
woman
(laughter),
some
condition
beyond
the
mere
fact
that
she
was
pregnant.
i
think
if
the
doctor
merely
determined
that
the
fact
she
was
pregnant
was
sufficient
grounds
for
performing
the
abortion
that,
that
would
raised
in
element
of
good
faith
and
his
good
faith
could
be
place
in
doubt
if
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
if
he
does
conclude
that,
if
he
does
conclude
that
her
mental
health
requires
that
she
have
the
abortion,
then
we
say
you
would
be
protected
as
long
as
that
judgment
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
we
don’t
believe
that
would
necessarily
be
true
say
if
have
doctor
who
performs
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh!
of
course,
we
believe
that
if
a
doctor
merely
performed
an
abortion
on
demand,
on
the
woman’s
request,
solely
on
the
woman’s
request
without
determining
that
special
conditions
separate
that
woman
from
the
general
class
of
women,
a
pregnant
woman.
that
special
health
grounds
separate
that
woman
from
the
general
class
of
healthy
pregnant
woman.
we
believe
that
if
a
doctor
merely
because
of
the
fact
of
pregnancy
performs
an
abortion
on
her
request
that
he
would
violate
the
statute
that
he
would
have
to
make
a
good
faith
judgment
that
there
were
special
conditions
pertaining
to
that
woman
within
his
view
jeopardized
her
health,
whether
either
mental
health
or
her
medical
health.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
we
would
not
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
huntington
no.
mr.
samuel
huntington
no
appellee,
appellee
does
argue
that
because
he
cites
the
statistics
to
show
that
the
abortion
operation
at
least
in
the
first
trimester
is
safer
than
proceeding
to
term
undergoing
natural,
regular
child
birth.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
that
type
of
danger
which
the
statute
is
aimed
at.
the
statute
was
passed
at
a
time
when
abortion
was
a
risky
operation.
we
believe
that
certainly
the
standard
health
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
adapted
the
statute,
would
involve
a
risk
to
health
which
would
be
greater
than
the
risk
of
the
abortion
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
they
had
in
mind
fairly
--
they
had
in
mind
complications
which
would
interfere
with
child
birth.
so
we
believe
that
just
the
fact
that
pregnancy
alone
is
insufficient,
if
a
doctor
wee
to
at
his
trial
if
he
were
to
introduce
medical
records
which
showed
that
the
woman
was
pregnant
and
rest
his
case,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
would
be
sufficient
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes.
mr.
samuel
huntington
but
nothing
more.
mr.
samuel
huntington
not
that
i
know
off.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
this
issue
i
believed
is
it
does
not
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court
as
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
do.
we
believe
that
it
is
reasonable
for
mainly
for
convenience
and
proof
purposes
to
place
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
evidence
on
the
justification
issue
on
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
that’s
true,
yes.
i
don’t
believe
it’s
necessary
to
go
in
with
that.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
at
any
rate
the
district
court
was
afraid
that
a
physician’s
professional
judgment
made
in
good
faith,
the
district
court
stated
that
judgment
should
not
be
challenged
and
we
say
we
agree
and
we
believe
that
the
williams
case
goes
a
long
ways
towards
establishing
a
good
faith
as
a
defense.
we
believe
it
is,
but
a
small
step
for
this
court
to
expand
on
the
williams
holding
and
certainly
this
court
has
the
power,
this
being
a
federal
statute,
this
court
has
the
power
to
construe
the
statute
so
as
to
limit
the
vagueness
attack
on
it.
now,
there
have
been
some
decisions
which
we
have
decided
in
our
brief
where
this
court
has
deferred
on
local
matters
to
the
decisions
of
the
district
courts.
the
case
of
the
district
of
columbia
against
little,
construing
a
search
regulation
of
the
dc
health
code,
this
court
concluded
that
where
statutory
questions
are
so
unmeshed
with
constitutional
issues
that
the
complete
disposition
of
the
case
is
appropriate
for
this
court.
this
is
such
a
case.
in
williams,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
a
decision
should
not
undertake
the
operation
unless
he
is
convinced
in
good
faith
of
its
therapeutic
necessity.
the
court
later
stated
a
competent
physician
who
acts
in
good
faith
will
always
be
in
the
position
to
come
forward
with
the
justification
for
any
operation.
we
do
not
believe
this
is
a
strained
interpretation
of
the
statute,
other
states
have
interpreted
their
statutes
to
allow
good
faith
as
a
defense.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
true.
in
massachusetts
however,
the
abortion
statute
there
has
been
interpreted
to
allow
health
grounds
as
a
justification
and
good
faith
has
been
recognized
there
as
a
defense.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
was
certainly
true
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
certainly
true
three
or
four
years
ago.
there
are
increasing
numbers
of
states
now
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
still
true.
i
think
alabama
is
the
only
one
that
specifically
mentions
health.
as
i
say
massachusetts
has
interpreted
their
statute
to
include
health.
well,
appellee
asserts
here
numerous
other
that
--
numerous
other
constitutional
issues
should
be
decided
by
this
court.
those
claims
were
presented
to
the
district
court,
but
the
district
court
did
not
cite
it.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
district
court
indicated
that
significant
constitutional
rights
were
involved.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
did.
it
certainly
--
it
stated
that
that
there
was
unquestionably
some
impingement
of
rights
involved
here.
now,
it
did
not
go
into
a
way
of
the
zone
of
interest
of
privacy
versus
state
interest
regulating
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we’re
submitting
that
there
are
sound
reasons
for
this
court
not
to
reach
the
issue.
it
reached
those
other
issues.
i
think
first
of
all
this
court
has
often
expressed
policy
against
deciding
constitutional
issues
unless
necessary
for
a
decision
of
a
case.
and
also
the
general
policy
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
to
construe
direct
appeals
narrowly,
but
more
directly,
we
believed
that
the
novel
rights
here
should
not
be
adjudicated
without
the
development
of
a
record.
we
believe
a
record
would
be
helpful
in
this
case,
the
precise
impact
of
the
dc
statute
is
far
from
clear.
mr.
samuel
huntington
he
might.
we
submit
that
the
proper
approach
would
be
to
develop
a
record.
i
think
that
the
questions
raised
which
relate
to
the
right
to
receive
medical
practice
and
the
rights
of
women
to
choose
when
and
whether
to
have
children
that
they’re
asserted
by
appellees
as
absolute
rights.
we
submit
that
the
state
interest
in
regulating
abortion
has
to
be
measured
against
these
absolute
rights
and
that
precisely
what
impact
the
dc
code
has
in
this
area
would
be
better
decided
on
a
specific
context
of
a
case.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
submit
that
the
issue
in
this
particular
case
is
somewhat
different
then
the
issues
in
most
of
the
other
cases
dealing
with
abortion
statutes.
only
in
--
i
think
it's
doe
v.
bolton,
the
georgia
three-judge
court,
was
a
statute
involved
that
used
the
term
health.
now,
because
under
our
interpretation
the
doctor
is
given
a
broad
scope
to
exercise
medical
judgment.
we
don’t
think
that
it
should
be
permitted
in
the
abstract
that
the
statute
interferes
with
that
--
with
a
basic
right
to
practice
medicine.
but
should
this
court
reach
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issues
here
involved,
i’d
like
to
state
very
briefly
the
government’s
position.
basic
questions
about
when
life
begins
and
when
it
should
be
protected
or
involved
and
underlie
all
of
these
abortion
statutes,
abortion
laws
that
reflect
the
views
of
the
major
segment
of
this
country’s
population,
that
the
embryo
should
be
protected.
contrary
views
of
course
are
held
by
many
people.
in
our
view,
resolution
of
this
very
fundamental
question
is
peculiarly
within
the
province
of
the
legislature.
we
believe
that
the
significance
of
the
medical
data
which
is
referred
to
in
the
amicus
brief
of
dr.
hapenan
(ph)
is
to
show
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
draw
a
line
at
some
stage
during
pregnancy.
the
common
law
drew
the
line
at
quickening
because
it
was
generally
felt
then
that
a
quickening
is
when
the
baby
became
alive.
but
the
--
during
the
19th
century
the
medical
profession
realized
that
was
really
relatively
insignificant.
it
may
have
had
an
effect
on
the
mother,
she
at
that
point
she
realized
that
something
was
moving
inside.
but
that
--
from
a
medical
point
of
view,
from
the
moment
of
conception
on
there
was
a
fairly
steady
development
which
continues
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
argue
that
you
should
not
reach
this
question
of
just
trying
to
state
our
views
just
to
meet
the
possibility
that
you
do
so
you
don’t
think
that
we
do
not
have
any
views
on
the
ultimate
question.
mr.
samuel
huntington
oh!
yes,
if
the
district
court
is
right
on
vagueness
and
of
course
we
don’t
reach
these
issues.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
we
believe
it
would
be.
that’s
under
the
dc
code
if
the
mother
does
not
commit
a
crime.
the
codes
interpreted
that
way
and
we
believe
that
this
expresses
the
will
of
congress
in
regulating
abortion
if
it
was
sufficient
to
go
after
the
doctor.
i
believe
that
in
some
states
do
make
laws
do
cover
the
women,
but
because
it's
impossible
to
draw
a
line
here
or
because
it's
very
difficult,
there
is
substantial
medical
evidence.
it's
not
based
solely
on
the
views
of
the
church
as
some
would
contend,
but
it's
based
on
basic
evidence
as
to
what
happens
in
the
development
of
life.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
we
--
we
submit
that
is
correct.
this
court
should
not
reach
the
merits.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that’s
right
and
we
submit
that
there
are
sound
reasons
that
this
court
not
to
reach
the
issue,
but
if
you
do
reach
that
issue.
if
you
do
determine
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
it's
not
an
absolute
rule,
there's
no
absolution
prohibition
in
this
court
reaching
these
issues
and
in
some
cases
you
have
reached
issues
which
is
not
yet
decided
by
the
district
court
and
those
are
sited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
statute
does
refer
to
the
health
of
the
mother
and
the
appellee
does
make
the
argument
that
the
statute
was
passed
solely
as
a
health
measure
to
protect
the
health
of
the
mother.
we
submit
that
while
the
legislative
history
of
the
dc
provision
is
indeed
sparse,
i
think
the
only
statement
we
could
determine
with
any
possible
relevance
is
that
the
author
of
the
code
drew
on
the
provisions
of
other
states.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
it
does
refer
to
the
mother’s
health,
but
by
limiting
abortions
to
instances
where
the
mother’s
health
required
it.
we
submit
that
the
statute
reflects
a
desire
to
protect
fetal
life.
that
if
that
was
not
a
factor
that
a
broader
statute
prohibiting
any
internal
surgery,
unless
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother
would
have
been
more
appropriate.
it
was
during
the
19th
century
in
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
that
most
of
the
laws
regulating
abortion
were
passed
in
the
states.
now,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
right,
many
of
the
other
statutes
passed
refer
only
to
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother.
they
don’t
mention
fetal
life
either.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
by
placing
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well
our
position
is
that
the
statue
that
by
regulating
abortion
in
that
way,
prohibiting
it
less
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
mother,
it
reflects
a
judgment
on
behalf
of
congress
that
where
the
mother's
health
doesn’t
require
an
abortion,
the
fetus
should
be
protected.
in
other
words,
if
the
mother
just
wanted
an
abortion
on
demand
that
this
would
not
be
sufficient
and
that
in
that
case,
the
interest
of
the
state
of
protecting
the
fetus
prevails.
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
correct,
that’s
the
only
thing
involved,
but
i
think
it
is
relevant
and
i’ll
just
draw
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
that
is
correct,
that’s
what
the
statute
states.
i
just
draw
the
court's
attention
in
closing
to
a
discussion
of
this
particular
issue
in
the
essay
by
professors
(inaudible)
and
noonan
in
constitutional
balance
at
pages,
it's
in
the
recent
book
by
noonan
entitled
the
morality
of
abortion
which
is
cited
in
page
36
of
our
brief
and
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
pages
223
to
226
of
that
essay
which
i
think
indicates
a
set
of
background
of
many
of
the
abortion
statutes.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
reminder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
huntington
at
first
i’d
like
to
refer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
blackmun
at
the
end
of
my
argument
that
the
question
of
rubella.
i
think
perhaps
i
was
too
hasty
in
my
response
to
that
question
that
that
would
not
be
grounds
for
an
abortion.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
chance
that
there
maybe
a
defect
in
the
fetus
that
it
quite
possibly
be
that
psychiatric
grounds
would
exist
for
justifying
the
abortion
in
that
case.
obviously,
the
prospect
of
the
raising
a
deform
trial
would
have
a
very
definite
traumatic
effect
on
a
woman
and
i
think
that
would
in
the
room
of
the
psychiatrist
to
determine
precisely
what
that
effect
would
be.
referring
to
the
professor
dorsen’s
attacks
on
the
vagueness
issue
and
mainly
that
it’s
interference
with
the
exercise
of
professional
judgment
by
doctors.
i
would
just
like
to
emphasize
the
narrowness
of
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
don’t
believe
the
doctor
will
be
second
guessed
by
a
prosecutor
or
a
jury.
we
believe
that
if
he
in
good
faith
determines
that
health
grounds
exist
that
that
is
the
end
of
it.
i’d
like
to
refer
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
i
believe
it
is
a
possible
construction
and
the
logical
construction
which
we
are
offering
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
necessary
for
health.
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
believe
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
is
that
the
word
health
is
a
medical
test,
in
that
if
a
doctor
concludes
in
good
faith
that
health
grounds
exist
that
that
should
be
the
end.
the
sole
question
before
the
jury
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
well,
we
don’t
believe
it
would
be
a
crime,
provided
that
he
exercises
the
judgment.
i
just
like
to
point
that
this
statute
is
not
--
that
the
government
does
not
harass
physicians
with
numerous
indictments
that
this
court
is
going
to
be
face
with
the
flooded
cases
involving
the
physicians.
in
the
last
ten
years,
i
believe
something
like
six
or
seven
indictments
have
been
--
six
or
seven
physicians
have
been
prosecuted
in
the
memory
of
the
chief
of
the
us
attorney,
criminal
division.
in
none
of
those
cases
that
did
a
doctor
raise
the
defense
of
good
faith.
the
position
of
the
government
is
to
go
after
doctors
to
limit
the
enforcement
of
the
law
against
doctors
who
do
not
make
medical
judgment
to
perform
abortion
on
demand.
mr.
samuel
huntington
on
demand
without
making
a
determination
in
each
instance
that
health
grounds
exist.
mr.
samuel
huntington
if
he
thinks
that
it’s
in
good
faith,
then
he
is
protected.
if
he
believes
that
the
health
grounds,
that
there
is
some
complication
that
would
raise
a
medical
problem
in
carrying
the
pregnancy
to
term,
or
if
he’s
psychiatrist,
if
the
psychiatrist
concludes
that
the
pregnancy
will
have
a
harmful
effect
to
her
--
to
the
woman’s
mental
well
being
and
they
determine
that
in
good
faith
--
mr.
samuel
huntington
the
psychiatrist
or
the
doctor,
those
in
medical
tests
and
we
believe
that
their
judgment
on
that
issue
should
be
protected.

no,
we
believe
that
it
can
be
administered
against
those
who
do
not
--

mr.
samuel

i
think
if
a
physician
said
it
was
in
good
faith
and
it
was
shown
by
the
government
that
at
every
single
case
where
a
woman
requested
an
abortion,
he
performed
it
that
that
would
place
an
issue
his
good
faith
in
meeting
the
grounds
of
the
statute.
mr.
samuel
huntington
a
doctor
was
acquitted?
mr.
samuel
huntington
no,
i’m
afraid
i’ve
haven’t
determined.
i
haven’t
read
over
the
all
cases
to
determine
that
your
honor.
well,
that’s
the
case
and
if
could
well
be.
mr.
samuel
huntington
yes,
a
medical
judgment
made
in
good
faith.
thank
you.
