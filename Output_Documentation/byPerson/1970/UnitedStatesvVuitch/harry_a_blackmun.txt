justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it,
it’s
your
position
that
that
applies
even
to
a
statue
restricted
in
its
application
to
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
it
stands
in
contrast
to
one
which
is
applicable
throughout
the
country
in
which
the
normal
district
court
elsewhere
will
have
to
do
with?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
certainly
it
is
true
on
the
state
side,
we
have
entirely
separate
criminal
procedure
with
channels
its
way
up
through
the
state
supreme
courts
and
here
we
have
or
dealing
with
a
local
statue,
which
conceivably
could
be
argued
anyway,
should
go
up
to
the
court
appeals
rather
than
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
i
understand
you,
you’re
really
speaking
of
abortion
on
request?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
nothing
more?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
in
the
district
any
statute
that
applicable
to
vasectomy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
do
not,
alright.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
i
follow
through
with
one
question
mr.
huntington
in
line
with
what
mr.
justice
black
was
saying.
if
we
had
a
situation
where
the
mother,
during
pregnancy,
was
exposed
to
rubella
or
there
was
some
thalidomide
background
or
something
and
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
dc
statute
would
not
warrant
an
abortion
under
those
circumstances
because
the
health
of
the
mother
is
not
involved.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
nellis,
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
referred
to
pending
cases
in
wisconsin
and
another
three-judge
cases
and
indicated
that
those
statutes
were
undergoing
severe
strain
and
had
been
held
unconstitutional
for
vagueness.
this
is
not
true
across
the
board,
is
it,
there
are
cases
the
other
way?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
have
this
in
mind.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
the
state
court
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
the
state
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
my
intimation
there
merely
is
that
that
is
a
case,
if
it
ever
comes
here,
which
is
fully
developed
because
there
has
been
a
trial
with
testimony,
medical
and
otherwise,
in
contrast
to
this
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
this
certainly
goes
to
your
point
of,
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
rid
of
these
statutes,
which
is
what
you’re
arguing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dorsen,
(inaudible)
all
those
words
regarding
malpractice
generally?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
accept
your
explanation
because
and
i
shouldn’t
draw
on
my
own
experience,
but
i’ve
seen
physician
after
physician
after
physicians
say
the
same
thing
about
malpractice
that
you
have
just
said
and
i
might
also
say,
drawing
on
my
own
experience
that
i
have
known
of
many
physicians
who
are
not
concerned
about
so
sword
of
damocles
in
these
decision
making
and
who
are
courageous
and
make
the
decisions,
they
have
to
do
it.
so
that
i
take
it
what
your
argument
comes
down
to
is
that,
fundamentally
it
applies
to
the
profession
as
a
whole,
that
there
are
of
course
exceptions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dorsen
may
i
interrupt
you
one
more
and
i
hope
that
neither
you
nor
mr.
nellies
nor
mr.
huntington
regard
these
questions
as
hostile.
i
think
it
is
better
in
the
interest
of
the
subject
matter.
is
it
not
true
or
i
suggest
that
the
average
physician
and
certainly
the
operating
surgeon
also
has
another
avenue
which
he
must
bear
in
mind
and
that
is
the
investigating
team
set
off
by
the
aha,
the
american
hospital
association
and
the
aama
checking
records
to
see
whether
there
is
any
unnecessary
surgery
going
on.
so
that
speaking
of
your
sword
of
damocle
is
not
only
is
the
criminal
aspect
here,
but
also
professional
standards
which
bear
upon
it
and
i've
already
mentioned
that
the
criminal
aspect
is
one,
but
are
there
not
these
other
factors
which
have
some
significance?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
abortion
area
probably,
investigation
by
aha
and
aama
teams
is
probably
more
acute
than
in
almost
any
other
area?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dorsen,
does
your
argument
about
her
right
to
do
with
her
body
what
you
have
suggested,
have
as
it's
ultimate
conclusion,
the
right
to
commit
suicide?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
next
step
is
a
challenge
to
the
statute
which
makes
suicide
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
your
argument
has
this
logical
conclusion
that
if
she
can
do
this
with
the
fetus,
can
she
come
in
to
the
doctor
and
say
saw
off
my
right
arm
because
i
want
it
off
and
saw
that
off.
i
really
not
–
i
am
just
asking.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it,
it’s
your
position
that
that
applies
even
to
a

restricted
in
its
