(inaudible)
wouldn't
you
suggest
the
government
if
it
was
persecuting
a
doctor
would
have
to
do
something
more
on
its
side
of
the
case
then
show
that
an
abortion
was
performed?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
it
may
not
have
to
be
decided,
but
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
would
think
that
the
government’s
appearance
in
such
case
would
be
limited
to
showing
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
isn’t
at
all
critical
your
case.
you
could
say
that
your
burden
would
be
to
prove
that
the
abortion
was
not
done
for
a
health
reason
and
you
would
still
reach
the
--
present
the
issues
that
you're
presenting
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
shouldn't
take
on
more
below
than
you
need
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
discuss
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
district
court
indicated
its
views
about
any
of
these
issues
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’re
suggesting
that
the
appellees
here
should
not
be
permitted
to
support
this
judgment
on
any
other
ground
than
the
vagueness
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
on
the
remand
that
you
have
to
order
evidence.
i
mean,
the
district
court
if
it
didn’t
reach
this
other
issues,
might
strike
down
the
statute
on
its
face
on
another
ground
without
any
record
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
i
gather
then
prefer
that
you
actually
make
a
record
of
a
lot
of
these
medical
and
factual
considerations
rather
than
attempt
to
take
judicial
notice,
and
texts,
and
treaties
and
opinions
and
like?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
then
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
–
(inaudible)
be
the
same
(inaudible)
with
respect
to
(inaudible)
crime
for
a
mother
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
nellis,
how
about
the
ground
on
which
the
district
court
proceeded,
namely
vagueness?
now,
let’s
assume
that
a
doctor
proceeds
to
give
an
abortion
on
demand
makes
no
medical
diagnosis
whatsoever,
doesn’t
purport
to
act
on
to
protect
the
health
of
either
the
mother
or
the
child
or
that
fetus.
why
is
that
particular
in
the
vuitch
or
in
any
position
to
claim
vagueness
in
the
statute
to
which
is
encountered
only
if
you
really
have
been
dealing
with
a
health
question?
he
hasn't
been
--
this
fellow
hasn’t
been
confused
at
all,
he’s
says
health
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
just
--
i’ll
just
have
to
pursue
you
further
then.
let’s
assume
the
patient
comes
in
and
wants
an
examination,
the
doctor
says
that
“you’re
pregnant,
you’re
perfectly
healthy,
it’s
going
to
be
a
wonderful
child.”
i
foresee
no
difficulty.
she
says,
well,
“by
the
way
doctor,
i
don’t
want
the
child,
i
want
an
abortion.”
and
he
says,
“oh,
you
do,
well
fine.”
there’s
no
health
reason
or
whatsoever
for
you
not
having
the
child,
but
if
you
don’t
want
the
child,
well,
that’s
your
right,”
that’s
your
right
and
then
he’s
indicted
under
the
statute
and
is
he
in
any
position
to
claim
that
the
statute
is
vague?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
on
the
facts
i
said,
he
said
there
is
no
health
reason
whatsoever
for
you
not
having
a
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
strange
health
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
based
on
those
facts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
shouldn’t.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well
now
you’ll
have
to
deal
with
the
case
of
the
first
child,
no
problems
in
money
whatsoever
and
the
doctor
says
“it’s
going
to
be
a
wonderful
child,
no
health
reasons
whatsoever,”
and
she
says,
“well,
by
the
way
i
don’t
want
it.”
justice
byron
r.
white
vagueness?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
after
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
claim
he
didn’t
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
argument
on
vagueness
and
the
court
below's
judgment
or
opinion
would
mean
that
--
well,
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
how
the
law
was
drafted
in
terms
of
the
time
of
the
pregnancy?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
law
would
be
as
just
as
vague
if
they
provided
that
abortions
could
be
performed
after
three
months,
but
not
afterwards.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dorsen,
this
is
one
of
the
standards
of
the
medical
profession
and
with
respect
to
surgeons
that
surgeons
are
not
to
perform
operations
that
are
not
required
but
they
help
the
patient?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
risk
of
that
if
the
doctor
performs,
he
must
make
the
judgment
at
the
risk
of
being
suspended
if
he’s
wrong
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
respect
to
the
whether
the
health
of
the
patient
requires
the
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
standard
though
for
medical
profession
with
respect
to
surgeon?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don’t
care
whether
its
gross
or
not,
but
the
standard
is
the
health
of
the
patient
requiring
the
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
do
you
think
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
through
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
so
far
as
--
insofar
as
it
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
somewhat
of
a
different
problems
occurs
so
that
fundamental
right
of
the
women
not
to
bear
a
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
difficult?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
draw
any
distinction?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
have
problems
with
that
mr.
dorsen
if
you're
not
take
the
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
am
talking
--
if
you
have
the
trouble
with
the
arm,
i
think
you
would
have
trouble
with
the
abortion,
especially
and
a
fortiori
if
you
recall
--
and
you
even
thought
that
the
unborn
child
had
some
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
an
arm
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
there
isn't
life?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
shouldn't
be
determined
on
medical
branch
(ph)?
justice
byron
