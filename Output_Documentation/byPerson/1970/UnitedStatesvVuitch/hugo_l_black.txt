justice

l.
black
i
don’t
quite
understand
why
your
arguing
about
the
health
of
the
embryo?
i
thought
the
statute
referred
to
the
health
of
the
mother.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don’t
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
drew
on
the
provision
of
other
states,
i
thought
this
referred
to
the
mother’s
health
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
was,
this
as
i
understand
it,
am
i
wrong,
refers
to
the
health
of
the
mother,
what
is
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
mother?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
the
fetal
life
problem,
when
the
statue
is
limited
to
the
preserving
the
health
or
life
of
the
mother?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
as
i
gather
it
that
the
only
thing
involved
is
the
health
of
the
mother?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
she
has
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
as
she
sees
fit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
kill
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
its
after
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
dispose
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
use
ordinary
language,
you
mean
to
dispose
of
the
child?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
disposed
of
the
child?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
its
wrong
but
i
just
don’t
care
to
be
cluttered
up
in
a
maze
of
words
that
means
something
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
whatever
it
is,
right
to
dispose
of
it
as
she
fits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
in
the
abstract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
the
brief
mr.
dorsen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it’s
not
a
separate
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
constitutional
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
the
way
that
you're
also
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
she
can
delegate
that
right
to
a
doctor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
constitutional
right
that
she
can
delegate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
we
wouldn't
do.
would
the
constitution
allow
you
to
say
that
a
doctor
had
a
right
make
a
woman
have
an
abortion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
can
convey
the
right
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitutional
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
your
brief
relying
on
griswold
against
connecticut?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
notice
that
it
doesn't
have
any
page;
that
says
passage.
what
is
that
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
necessary,
under
the
(inaudible)
statutes,
is
that
a
necessary
construction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
necessary
for
health?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
juror
is
not
capable
of
determining
that
from
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
rather
an
unusual
criminal
act
to
let
the
man
charged
with
the
crime
to
determine
whether
in
good
faith
that
crime
ought
to
be
performed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
good
faith?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
any
chance
that
you
have
leave
if
he
thought
it
was
was
in
good
faith,
usually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
determine
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
concede
that
i
guess
i
--
you
have
always
conceded
as
the
too
ambiguous
to
be
administered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
–
how
can
they
prove
it,
he
said
its
in
good
faith
and
not
judge
to
them
out
