mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
large
part
i
believe
agrees
with
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
this
court
has
asked
twice
in
this
case
whether
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration
it
should
abstain
from
accepting
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
because
the
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
statute,
the
application
of
which
is
confined
solely
to
the
district
of
columbia.
your
honors,
the
statute
certainly
contains
sufficiently
broad
language
to
make
it
appear,
at
least
facially,
that
the
government
had
the
right
to
make
the
executive
choice
of
brining
this
case
directly
to
the
court.
if
i
may
i
would
just
like
to
read
the
first
paragraph,
title
18,
u.s.c.
3731,
“an
appeal
may
be
taken
by
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
from
the
district
courts
direct
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
all
criminal
cases
in
the
following
instances”
and
the
instance
of
course
of
which
we
in
the
government
rely
jointly
is
“from
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information
or
any
count
thereof
where
such
decision
is
based
upon
invalidity
of
the
construction
of
the
statute.”
so
we
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
united
states
is
correct
in
stating
that
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
the
case
is
here
mandatory,
but
should
the
court
feel
that
the
case
is
not
mandatory
before
it
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
we
would
like
to
suggest
that
there
are
factors
other
than
the
scope
of
applicability
of
the
statute
which
dictate
that
the
court
should
entertain
jurisdiction.
i
believe
that
it
is
fair
statement
that
this
court
should
accept
jurisdiction
by
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
if
nothing
else.
what
your
honors
have
before
you
today
is
a
matter
of
landmark
and
historic
importance
in
the
area
of
constitutional
law.
whatever
merit
there
might
be
to
a
general
policy
of
waiting
in
event
initial
decision
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
your
honors
that
there
are
myriads
of
cases
brewing
it
the
lower
courts
and
i'm
sure
your
honors
are
aware
of
it.
we
now
have
situations
where
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
a
three-judge
federal
court
has
declared
the
wisconsin
abortion
statute
unconstitutional.
this
is
also
true
with
respect
with
georgia
and
texas
and
i'm
advised
that
a
three-judge
court
in
pennsylvania
has
done
the
same.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
no
your
honor,
they
vary.
in
the
wisconsin
case
mr.
justice
stewart
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
was
that
under
the
ninth
amendment,
embryo
the
rights
described
in
the
griswold
case,
the
woman
has
the
right
of
privacy
and
indeed
and
i
want
to
state
it
as
succinctly
as
i
can
as
an
absolute
right
to
an
abortion.
she
has
the
absolute
right,
the
court
said
not
to
carry
on
statutory
term,
if
i
may
use
that
phrase,
an
embryo
which
she
does
not
desire
to
carry
to
term.
so
my
point
is
really
this
that
there
are
so
many
cases
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes
your
honor,
the
court
in
the
wisconsin
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
no,
your
honor.
i
don’t
accept
the
notion
that
the
abortion
of
an
embryo
before
the
20th
week
before
the
common
law
quickening
is
an
act
of
killing
at
all.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor
various
statutes
have
held
on
the
basis
of
medical
knowledge
that
had
since
overtaken
it
that
after
quickening,
an
abortion
should
be
performed
only
for
the
utmost
and
consequential
health,
a
mental
health
as
well
as
physical
health
reasons.
but
in
the
wisconsin
case
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
held
that
the
woman
has
the
absolute
right
not
to
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
not
to
have
the
embryo
continue
to
a
point
of
birth
up
to
20
weeks.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
to
have
an
abortion
which
in
effect
disposes
of
a
fetus,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
justice
black
i'm
not
trying
to
offer
an
escape
to
my
answer.
i
cannot
accept,
if
you
don’t
mind
me
saying
so,
the
word
“child”
as
related
to
a
fetus.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
of
the
fetus,
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct
and
in
fact
that
the
more
modern
american
penal
code
statutes
provide
for
terminations
of
pregnancies
under
therapeutic
conditions
up
to
20
and
24
weeks.
our
neighboring
state
of
maryland
has
such
a
statute
and
there
are
13
others.
my
only
point
is
that
there
are
so
many
cases
pending,
this
matter
is
of
such
enormous
national
significance
that
i
would
hope
that
your
honors
would,
if
you
don’t
accept
the
mandatory
provision
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
that
you
would
exercise
your
sound
judicial
discretion
and
take
this
mater
under
advisement
on
its
merits
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
my
answer
would
be
two-fold.
first,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
an
enormous
problem
with
the
judicial
administration
to
deal
with
every
variegated
facet
of
the
abortion
area
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
that
is
to
say,
the
authorities
which
have
been
decided
in
our
briefs,
and
in
the
government’s
brief,
the
statistics,
the
material,
the
medical
knowledge,
all
of
it
is
available.
it’s
before
your
honors
now.
if
in
each
case
where
a
doctor,
and
i
feel
strongly
that
it’s
an
unjust
indictment,
a
doctor
were
indicted,
we
would
have
to
send
the
case
back
in
order
to
find
out
in
each
instance
what
his
justification
was
for
performing
a
particular
abortion.
your
honors
would
never
be
able
to
decide
the
tremendous
variety
of
instances
that
occur
in
medical
practice.
so,
the
first
part
of
my
answer
is
that
this
is
not
a
subject
matter
in
my
humble
opinion
which
can
be
dealt
with
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
on
the
second
level,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
you
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
is
hardly
any
area
of
criminal
law
more
unique
than
this.
here
you
have
a
situation
in
which
a
woman
comes
to
a
doctor
and
pleads
with
him
to
help
her
medically.
he
helps
her
and
he
becomes
the
offender.
he
faces
the
one
to
10
years
in
jail.
it
is
the
most
anomalous
situation
in
which
the
complaining
witness
and
has
been
in
the
courtroom
and
have
handled
these
cases,
becomes
the
most
reluctant
witness
against
this
doctor.
as
a
result
of
what
i
am
saying,
my
point
is
simply
that
there
are
no
facts
that
i
can
think
of,
that
could
be
developed
in
a
context
of
a
criminal
case
that
are
not
already
fully
before
your
honors
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
say
there
for
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
your
home
state
of
minnesota
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes
sir,
i’m
sure
you
did.
in
your
home
state
of
minnesota,
i
regret
to
say
a
three-judge
court
has
recently
held
otherwise,
but
in
the
first
instance
in
that
case
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
held
otherwise
as
well.
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
three-judge
court
in
the
hudson
case
originally
held
that
the
statute
was
not
in
jeopardy
because
the
doctor
had
not
been
indicted,
but
i
am
very
hopeful,
your
honor,
that
in
the
great
state
of
minnesota,
the
same
enlightened
opinion
will
resolve
this
as
resolved
in
another
great
states.
i
feel
very
strongly
that
the
proliferation,
the
multiplicity
of
suits
which
will
be
reaching,
which
are
reaching
this
court
now,
could
be
very
deftly
and
intelligently
approached
by
a
decision
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
i
see
the
difference,
of
course,
between
the
situations
in
which
a
doctor
has
been
put
on
trial.
evidence
has
been
adduced.
he
is
required
to
come
forward
and
give
his
good
faith
justification
for
his
medical
acts
and
the
jury
has
either
accepted
or
rejected
than
one
of
these
justifications,
which
i
think
is
another
serious
area
of
constitutional
conformity.
but
there
are
also
cases
where
three-judge
courts
as
in
wisconsin,
mr.
justice,
have
said
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
in
the
case
of
the
wisconsin’s
statute,
the
court
said
in
the
doctrine
of
griswold
and
other
cases
in
this
court
that
a
woman
has
an
absolute
right
of
privacy
under
the
ninth
amendment
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
factual
record
that
would
either
enhance
or
detract
from
the
ability
of
the
court
to
determine
that
right
of
privacy.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
factual
circumstances
you
put
would
only
be
applicable
in
my
judgment
to
a
non-medical
practitioner,
in
other
words,
“a
quack.”
i
do
not
know
of
any
instance
in
which
a
woman
coming
to
a
reputable
doctor's
office
would
not
be
examined
medically,
questioned
as
to
her
history
and
a
determination
made
with
respect
to
why
it
is,
what
it
is,
that
is
causing
the
doctor
to
make
a
judgment.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor
has
put
a
case
which
makes
a
very
clear
it
very
clear
i
think,
the
word
“health.”
what
does
the
word
“health”
mean
in
this
statute?
i
will
ask.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
but
if
you
want
to
restrict
me
to
the
fact
that
you
put
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
have
a
difficult
time,
may
i
have
one
fact
of
my
own?
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
oh,
not
that
that
the
doctor
suggests
that
you
can
have
an
abortion
just
because
she
wants
it,
but
that
she
says,
“i’ve
been
married
for
10
years
and
i
have
four
children
and
we
can't
afford
another
child.”
now,
we’ve
added
a
factor
which
raises
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
of
columbia
statute
when
it
uses
the
word
“health,”
encompasses
that
kind
of
treatment.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
and
i
don’t
feel
cornered
if
i
may
say
so
sir
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
socioeconomic
reasons
in
modern
days
apparently
approach
health
reasons,
that
it
takes
money
to
raise
children.
it
takes
love
to
want
children.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
and
your
question
is
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
oh!
statute
is
completely
vagueness
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
oh,
certainly.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
i
think
that
he
could
give
no
reason,
he
could
do
the
job,
although
i
can’t
perceive
of
any
such
circumstance
occurring,
could
do
the
job
on
the
request
of
the
mother.
and
faced
with
an
indictment
under
this
statute
could,
i
maintain,
claim
that
the
statute
is
completely
vague
as
to
whether
or
not
the
consideration
you
and
i
have
been
discussing
mr.
justice
white
is
a
proper
one
under
the
term
“health.”
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
if
i
gave
that
impression
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i
apologize,
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
say.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
under
those
factual
circumstances
where
a
woman
would
not
be
examined
medically,
that
would
probably
take
place
in
a
back
alley
on
a
back
room
where
many
abortions
have
performed
because
of
the
abortion
law
of
the
united
states.
i
did
not
mean
to
distinguish
between
reputable
and
disreputable
doctors.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
there
are
abortions
being
performed
daily
as
a
result
of
laws
like
the
one
we
have
under
examination
here
mr.
chief
justice
that
are
performed
by
non-medical
men
and
judge
gesell
wisely,
in
his
decision
in
the
court
below,
stated
that
all
that
i
am
saying
about
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
is
that
abortions
maybe
performed
only
by
compliment,
duly
licensed
and
qualified
physicians.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i’m
sorry.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
provided
there
were
no
other
criteria.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
i
wanted
briefly
to
return
and
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me
when
i
say
that
i
wanted
briefly
to
return
to
the
question
of
review
because
i
know
that
this
is
troubling
the
court
and
i
feel
that
in
some
recent
cases,
this
court
has
acted
in
the
manner
to
enhance
the
prospect
of
taking
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
in
the
sisson
case,
which
this
court
decided
in
june
of
1970,
review
was
denied
because
in
that
case
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
which
the
judge
wisesky
in
boston
had
granted
in
connection
with
a
selective
service
case,
but
i’m
very
impressed
with
the
fact
that
in
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
dissent,
this
court
states
that
if
a
statute
is
unclear
and
as
ambiguous
as
the
criminal
appeals
act,
which
your
honors
will
not
have
to
contend
with
after
the
effective
date
on
january
2
anymore,
the
words
of
the
statute
are
the
only
the
first
place
to
begin
interpretation.
and
i
would
say
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute
on
the
carroll
–
on
the
face
of
the
carroll
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
that
this
court
mandatorily
should
take
jurisdiction
and
that
if
there’s
any
doubt
in
this
court’s
mind,
it
should
exercise
discretion
in
that
regard.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
large
part
i
believe
agrees
with
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
this
court
has
asked
twice
in
this
case
whether
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration
it
should
abstain
from
accepting
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
because
the
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
statute,
the
application
of
which
is
confined
solely
to
the
district
of
columbia.
your
honors,
the
statute
certainly
contains
sufficiently
broad
language
to
make
it
appear,
at
least
facially,
that
the
government
had
the
right
to
make
the
executive
choice
of
brining
this
case
directly
to
the
court.
if
i
may
i
would
just
like
to
read
the
first
paragraph,
title
18,
u.s.c.
3731,
“an
appeal
may
be
taken
by
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
from
the
district
courts
direct
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
all
criminal
cases
in
the
following
instances”
and
the
instance
of
course
of
which
we
in
the
government
rely
jointly
is
“from
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment
or
information
or
any
count
thereof
where
such
decision
is
based
upon
invalidity
of
the
construction
of
the
statute.”
so
we
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
united
states
is
correct
in
stating
that
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
the
case
is
here
mandatory,
but
should
the
court
feel
that
the
case
is
not
mandatory
before
it
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
we
would
like
to
suggest
that
there
are
factors
other
than
the
scope
of
applicability
of
the
statute
which
dictate
that
the
court
should
entertain
jurisdiction.
i
believe
that
it
is
fair
statement
that
this
court
should
accept
jurisdiction
by
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
if
nothing
else.
what
your
honors
have
before
you
today
is
a
matter
of
landmark
and
historic
importance
in
the
area
of
constitutional
law.
whatever
merit
there
might
be
to
a
general
policy
of
waiting
in
event
initial
decision
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
your
honors
that
there
are
myriads
of
cases
brewing
it
the
lower
courts
and
i'm
sure
your
honors
are
aware
of
it.
we
now
have
situations
where
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
a
three-judge
federal
court
has
declared
the
wisconsin
abortion
statute
unconstitutional.
this
is
also
true
with
respect
with
georgia
and
texas
and
i'm
advised
that
a
three-judge
court
in
pennsylvania
has
done
the
same.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
no
your
honor,
they
vary.
in
the
wisconsin
case
mr.
justice
stewart
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
was
that
under
the
ninth
amendment,
embryo
the
rights
described
in
the
griswold
case,
the
woman
has
the
right
of
privacy
and
indeed
and
i
want
to
state
it
as
succinctly
as
i
can
as
an
absolute
right
to
an
abortion.
she
has
the
absolute
right,
the
court
said
not
to
carry
on
statutory
term,
if
i
may
use
that
phrase,
an
embryo
which
she
does
not
desire
to
carry
to
term.
so
my
point
is
really
this
that
there
are
so
many
cases
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes
your
honor,
the
court
in
the
wisconsin
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
no,
your
honor.
i
don’t
accept
the
notion
that
the
abortion
of
an
embryo
before
the
20th
week
before
the
common
law
quickening
is
an
act
of
killing
at
all.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor
various
statutes
have
held
on
the
basis
of
medical
knowledge
that
had
since
overtaken
it
that
after
quickening,
an
abortion
should
be
performed
only
for
the
utmost
and
consequential
health,
a
mental
health
as
well
as
physical
health
reasons.
but
in
the
wisconsin
case
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
held
that
the
woman
has
the
absolute
right
not
to
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
not
to
have
the
embryo
continue
to
a
point
of
birth
up
to
20
weeks.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
to
have
an
abortion
which
in
effect
disposes
of
a
fetus,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
justice
black
i'm
not
trying
to
offer
an
escape
to
my
answer.
i
cannot
accept,
if
you
don’t
mind
me
saying
so,
the
word
“child”
as
related
to
a
fetus.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
of
the
fetus,
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct
and
in
fact
that
the
more
modern
american
penal
code
statutes
provide
for
terminations
of
pregnancies
under
therapeutic
conditions
up
to
20
and
24
weeks.
our
neighboring
state
of
maryland
has
such
a
statute
and
there
are
13
others.
my
only
point
is
that
there
are
so
many
cases
pending,
this
matter
is
of
such
enormous
national
significance
that
i
would
hope
that
your
honors
would,
if
you
don’t
accept
the
mandatory
provision
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
that
you
would
exercise
your
sound
judicial
discretion
and
take
this
mater
under
advisement
on
its
merits
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
my
answer
would
be
two-fold.
first,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
an
enormous
problem
with
the
judicial
administration
to
deal
with
every
variegated
facet
of
the
abortion
area
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
that
is
to
say,
the
authorities
which
have
been
decided
in
our
briefs,
and
in
the
government’s
brief,
the
statistics,
the
material,
the
medical
knowledge,
all
of
it
is
available.
it’s
before
your
honors
now.
if
in
each
case
where
a
doctor,
and
i
feel
strongly
that
it’s
an
unjust
indictment,
a
doctor
were
indicted,
we
would
have
to
send
the
case
back
in
order
to
find
out
in
each
instance
what
his
justification
was
for
performing
a
particular
abortion.
your
honors
would
never
be
able
to
decide
the
tremendous
variety
of
instances
that
occur
in
medical
practice.
so,
the
first
part
of
my
answer
is
that
this
is
not
a
subject
matter
in
my
humble
opinion
which
can
be
dealt
with
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
on
the
second
level,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
you
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
is
hardly
any
area
of
criminal
law
more
unique
than
this.
here
you
have
a
situation
in
which
a
woman
comes
to
a
doctor
and
pleads
with
him
to
help
her
medically.
he
helps
her
and
he
becomes
the
offender.
he
faces
the
one
to
10
years
in
jail.
it
is
the
most
anomalous
situation
in
which
the
complaining
witness
and
has
been
in
the
courtroom
and
have
handled
these
cases,
becomes
the
most
reluctant
witness
against
this
doctor.
as
a
result
of
what
i
am
saying,
my
point
is
simply
that
there
are
no
facts
that
i
can
think
of,
that
could
be
developed
in
a
context
of
a
criminal
case
that
are
not
already
fully
before
your
honors
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
say
there
for
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
your
home
state
of
minnesota
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes
sir,
i’m
sure
you
did.
in
your
home
state
of
minnesota,
i
regret
to
say
a
three-judge
court
has
recently
held
otherwise,
but
in
the
first
instance
in
that
case
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
held
otherwise
as
well.
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
three-judge
court
in
the
hudson
case
originally
held
that
the
statute
was
not
in
jeopardy
because
the
doctor
had
not
been
indicted,
but
i
am
very
hopeful,
your
honor,
that
in
the
great
state
of
minnesota,
the
same
enlightened
opinion
will
resolve
this
as
resolved
in
another
great
states.
i
feel
very
strongly
that
the
proliferation,
the
multiplicity
of
suits
which
will
be
reaching,
which
are
reaching
this
court
now,
could
be
very
deftly
and
intelligently
approached
by
a
decision
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
i
see
the
difference,
of
course,
between
the
situations
in
which
a
doctor
has
been
put
on
trial.
evidence
has
been
adduced.
he
is
required
to
come
forward
and
give
his
good
faith
justification
for
his
medical
acts
and
the
jury
has
either
accepted
or
rejected
than
one
of
these
justifications,
which
i
think
is
another
serious
area
of
constitutional
conformity.
but
there
are
also
cases
where
three-judge
courts
as
in
wisconsin,
mr.
justice,
have
said
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
in
the
case
of
the
wisconsin’s
statute,
the
court
said
in
the
doctrine
of
griswold
and
other
cases
in
this
court
that
a
woman
has
an
absolute
right
of
privacy
under
the
ninth
amendment
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
factual
record
that
would
either
enhance
or
detract
from
the
ability
of
the
court
to
determine
that
right
of
privacy.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
factual
circumstances
you
put
would
only
be
applicable
in
my
judgment
to
a
non-medical
practitioner,
in
other
words,
“a
quack.”
i
do
not
know
of
any
instance
in
which
a
woman
coming
to
a
reputable
doctor's
office
would
not
be
examined
medically,
questioned
as
to
her
history
and
a
determination
made
with
respect
to
why
it
is,
what
it
is,
that
is
causing
the
doctor
to
make
a
judgment.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor
has
put
a
case
which
makes
a
very
clear
it
very
clear
i
think,
the
word
“health.”
what
does
the
word
“health”
mean
in
this
statute?
i
will
ask.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
but
if
you
want
to
restrict
me
to
the
fact
that
you
put
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
have
a
difficult
time,
may
i
have
one
fact
of
my
own?
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
oh,
not
that
that
the
doctor
suggests
that
you
can
have
an
abortion
just
because
she
wants
it,
but
that
she
says,
“i’ve
been
married
for
10
years
and
i
have
four
children
and
we
can't
afford
another
child.”
now,
we’ve
added
a
factor
which
raises
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
of
columbia
statute
when
it
uses
the
word
“health,”
encompasses
that
kind
of
treatment.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
and
i
don’t
feel
cornered
if
i
may
say
so
sir
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
socioeconomic
reasons
in
modern
days
apparently
approach
health
reasons,
that
it
takes
money
to
raise
children.
it
takes
love
to
want
children.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
and
your
question
is
sir?
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
oh!
statute
is
completely
vagueness
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
oh,
certainly.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
your
honor,
i
think
that
he
could
give
no
reason,
he
could
do
the
job,
although
i
can’t
perceive
of
any
such
circumstance
occurring,
could
do
the
job
on
the
request
of
the
mother.
and
faced
with
an
indictment
under
this
statute
could,
i
maintain,
claim
that
the
statute
is
completely
vague
as
to
whether
or
not
the
consideration
you
and
i
have
been
discussing
mr.
justice
white
is
a
proper
one
under
the
term
“health.”
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
if
i
gave
that
impression
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i
apologize,
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
say.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
under
those
factual
circumstances
where
a
woman
would
not
be
examined
medically,
that
would
probably
take
place
in
a
back
alley
on
a
back
room
where
many
abortions
have
performed
because
of
the
abortion
law
of
the
united
states.
i
did
not
mean
to
distinguish
between
reputable
and
disreputable
doctors.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
there
are
abortions
being
performed
daily
as
a
result
of
laws
like
the
one
we
have
under
examination
here
mr.
chief
justice
that
are
performed
by
non-medical
men
and
judge
gesell
wisely,
in
his
decision
in
the
court
below,
stated
that
all
that
i
am
saying
about
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
is
that
abortions
maybe
performed
only
by
compliment,
duly
licensed
and
qualified
physicians.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
i’m
sorry.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
provided
there
were
no
other
criteria.
mr.
joseph
l.
nellis
yes,
your
honor.
i
wanted
briefly
to
return
and
i
hope
the
court
will
indulge
me
when
i
say
that
i
wanted
briefly
to
return
to
the
question
of
review
because
i
know
that
this
is
troubling
the
court
and
i
feel
that
in
some
recent
cases,
this
court
has
acted
in
the
manner
to
enhance
the
prospect
of
taking
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
in
the
sisson
case,
which
this
court
decided
in
june
of
1970,
review
was
denied
because
in
that
case
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
which
the
judge
wisesky
in
boston
had
granted
in
connection
with
a
selective
service
case,
but
i’m
very
impressed
with
the
fact
that
in
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
dissent,
this
court
states
that
if
a
statute
is
unclear
and
as
ambiguous
as
the
criminal
appeals
act,
which
your
honors
will
not
have
to
contend
with
after
the
effective
date
on
january
2
anymore,
the
words
of
the
statute
are
the
only
the
first
place
to
begin
interpretation.
and
i
would
say
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute
on
the
carroll
–
on
the
face
of
the
carroll
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
that
this
court
mandatorily
should
take
jurisdiction
and
that
if
there’s
any
doubt
in
this
court’s
mind,
it
should
exercise
discretion
in
that
regard.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
