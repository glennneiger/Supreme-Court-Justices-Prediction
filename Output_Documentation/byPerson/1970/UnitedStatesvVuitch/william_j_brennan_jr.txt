mr.
huntington
was
there
any
united
states
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
1907?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
1907
or
1908
had
done
what
was
done
here
by
the
district
court
would
that
case
dismissed
of
indictment
and
appealed
directly
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
have
any
relevance?
now
this
statute
we’re
dealing
with
i
gather
is
1907
version,
isn’t,
not
the
1942
version?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
the
amendment
in
1942
as
i
recall
it,
am
i
right,
simply
to
establish
the
government’s
right
of
appealed
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
government's
right
of
appeal
directly
to
this
court
derives
only
from
1907
statute,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my
question
then
is
if
that
so,
as
a
fact
that
you
could
not
have
compile
directly
from
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
does
that
bear
on
the
instruction
we
only
give
the
3731
in
its
1907?
