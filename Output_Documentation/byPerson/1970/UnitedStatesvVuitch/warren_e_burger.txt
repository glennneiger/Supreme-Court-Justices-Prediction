i
don’t
yet
see

counsel.
once
it's
stricken

then
this

reach
the

that
i
can
see

it
now
stands?
chief

i
think
the

have
been
sufficiently
explored
here
so
that
were
going

reduce

a
little
bit
counsel.
i’d
allow

we’ll
reduce

you

in

chief

mr.

i
detected
in
one
of

responses
a
suggestion
that
you
were
contemplating
one
rule
under
this
statute
for
reputable
doctors,
i
think
you
use
that
term
and
another
for
doctors
who
are
not
reputable.
now,
how
can
you
have
any
difference?
chief

what
i
wanted
to
do
in

take,
pursue

client.
a
doctor
who
has
a
serious
cardiac
patient
and
needs
certain
surgery,
unrelated
to
the
cardiac

he
must
make
a
very
difficult
decision
there
which
whether
this
will
endanger
the
health
or
the
life
of
the
patient,
isn't
that
true?
chief

and
if
he
makes
the
wrong
decision
as
the

sees
it
later,
the

is
pretty
disabled,
he
risks
what
has
just
blackmun
was
talking
about
the
malpractice,
doesn't
he?
chief

e.

is
that
different
from

malpractice
case?
chief

warren
e.

you’re
speaking
of
the
caution
professor

if
he
wants
to
be
this
very
cautious
practitioner
and
cautious
in
the
sense
of
protecting
himself
and
he
would
simply
say
it’s
too
risky
to
this
surgery
and
then
he
refrains
from
doing
the
surgery.
now,
is
that
any
different?

the
