mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
an
appeal
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california.
the
case
is
a
customs
seizure
case.
the
claimant
returned
to
this
country
by
air
on
october
24,
1969
arriving
in
los
angeles.
during
customs
inspection,
the
thirty-seven
photographs
involved
here
were
seized
together
with
certain
other
items.
all
but
the
photographs
have
been
returned
and
only
the
seizure
of
the
photographs
is
involved
here.
it
is
stipulated
and
that
the
photographs
were
intended
to
be
incorporated
into
a
hard
covered
book
and
i
quote
from
page
16
of
the
record
in
the
stipulation,
which
book
describes
candidly
a
large
number
of
sexual
positions.
on
october
31,
i
may
say
the
photographs
have
been
lodged
with
the
cleric
of
the
court.
on
october
31,
1969,
the
district
director
of
customs
advised
the
claimant
luros
that
the
matter
had
been
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
forfeiture
action.
on
november
4,
the
claimant’s
attorney
demanded
the
return
of
the
photographs.
on
november
6,
13
days
after
the
arrival
in
los
angeles,
the
united
states
started
this
action
for
forfeiture,
under
title
19
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1305(a),
a
statutory
provision
which
is
printed
at
pages
2-4
of
our
brief.
eight
days
later,
the
claimant
filed
an
answer
and
counter
claim
contending
that
the
photographs
were
not
obscene
and
that
the
statutory
provision
was
unconstitutional.
he
moved
for
a
three-judge
court
because
he
sought
a
declaration
and
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
and
in
order
to
convene,
a
three-judge
court
was
entered
on
november
20,
1969.
the
hearing
was
held
on
january
9,
1970
and
the
three-judge
court’s
opinion
was
issued
on
january
27,
1970.
the
court
treated
the
motion
for
injunction
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
assumed
that
the
pictures
are
obscene.
that
issue
has
never
been
adjudicated
and
is
not
directly
involved
here.
what
the
court
did
was
to
rule
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
it
reached
this
conclusion
by
an
application
or
perhaps
one
can
fairly
say
by
an
extension
of
this
court’s
decision
in
stanley
against
georgia,
in
394
u.s.
although,
the
claimant
had
stipulated
that
he
imported
the
pictures
for
commercial
use.
the
court
held
that
he
had
standing
to
attack
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
its
application
to
importation
for
private
use,
to
which
it
said
the
stanley
case
applied.
the
court
also
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
under
freedman
against
maryland
in
380
u.s.
because
it
failed
to
guarantee
that
any
restraint
on
allegedly
obscene
material
would
be
imposed
for
only
a
specified
brief
period
prior
to
judicial
resolution
of
the
issue
of
“obscenity”.
the
first
question,
i
wish
to
present
is
that
with
respect
to
stanley
against
georgia.
that
case
was
won
as
the
court
observed
in
the
opinion
of
first
impression.
the
court
wrote
a
careful
opinion
which
was
narrowly
limited.
but
in
less
than
two
years,
it
has
proliferated
in
the
lower
courts,
afar
beyond
anything
that
was
presaged
in
this
court’s
opinion.
from
protection
to
a
man
in
his
home,
it
has
blossomed
out
to
cover
the
whole
world.
that
extension
is
involved
in
this
case
in
the
reidel
case
which
is
the
next
on
the
calendar,
and
in
several
other
cases
which
we
have
felt
it
necessary
to
bring
to
the
court
and
in
many
others
which
are
pending
in
lower
courts
awaiting
this
court’s
decision.
it’s
also
involved
in
the
case
of
burn
against
carolexis
(ph)
at
number
83
which
was
argued
last
term
and
re-argued
on
november
17th.
stanley
against
georgia
is
obviously
an
important
case,
one
that
will
be
discussed
for
many
years
to
come.
it
has
roots
in
the
boyd
case
of
8
years
ago
and
justice
brandeis's
dissent
in
the
olmstead
case,
in
justice
harlan’s
dissent
peo
against
ullman,
in
justice
stewart’s
memorandum
in
mapp
against
ohio
and
in
this
court’s
decision
in
griswold
against
connecticut.
it
is
not
the
worst
for
the
fact
that
its
conclusion
has
never
been
firmly
bound
to
the
text
of
any
particular
constitutional
provision.
that
fact
may
indicate
however
that
those
sound
in
result,
the
verbalization
may
be
subject
to
further
refinement
as
applied
to
particular
new
situations.
in
the
stanley
opinion
itself,
the
court
seemed
to
cover
a
case
such
as
this.
it
distinguished
in
earlier
cases
on
the
ground
that
they
and
i
quote,
“deal
for
the
most
part
with
the
use
of
the
mails
to
distribute
objectionable
material
or
was
some
sort
of
public
distribution
or
dissemination,”.
that
appears
in
page
561
of
394
u.s.
it
referred
to
other
cases
as
dealing
and
i
quote,
“with
the
power
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
to
prohibit
or
regulate
certain
public
actions
taken
or
intended
to
be
taken
with
respect
to
obscene
matter.
citing
prosecutions
for
sale
and
distribution,”
that
likewise
is
on
page
561.
it
referred
to
this
court’s
decision
in
the
roth
case
as
involving
and
i
quote,
“the
regulation
of
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material.”
that’s
on
pages
563
and
564.
and
finally
the
court
specifically
stated
that
and
again
i
quote,
“roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding,”.
this
seems
clear
enough
and
it
seems
clearly
applicable
to
the
present
case
which
after
all
involves
importation
and
area
traditionally
subject
to
close
control
by
congress
and
importation
for
commercial
purposes.
the
difficulty
arises
because
of
some
passages
in
the
opinion
which
i
think
must
be
regarded
as
passing
references
and
not
central
to
the
decision
itself.
the
court
did
say
that
and
i
quote,
“it
is
now
well
established
that
the
constitution
protects
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas.”
and
a
little
later
on
in
the
same
paragraph,
the
court
said
that
and
i
quote,
“this
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas
regardless
of
their
social
worth
is
fundamental
to
our
free
society.
that
is
fairly
strong
language
but
even
that
refers
to
the
recipient
and
does
not
assert
any
such
right
to
distribute.”
a
little
later,
the
court
referred
to
“the
transmission
of
ideas.”
but
the
essence
of
this
court’s
decision,
we
submit
is
found
in
it’s
concern
for
mr.
stanley.
it
referred
to
a
man
sitting
alone
in
his
own
home
and
in
his
own
house.
it
referred
to
his
right
to
satisfy
his
intellectual
and
emotional
needs
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
the
majority
of
the
court
used
some
first
amendment
language.
other
members
of
the
court
preferred
to
express
the
conclusion
in
fourth
amendment
terms.
perhaps
it
could
fairly
be
said
here
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
suffice.
but
it
was
mr.
stanley
who
was
protected
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home,
it
was
not
the
materials.
they
are
still
expressly
subject
to
roth.
indeed
it
was
only
last
thursday
in
the
mailbox’s
case
that
the
court
reiterated
its
previous
determination
that
constitutionally
protected
expression
is
separated,
and
that
is
the
word
use
by
the
court
in
quoting
from
one
of
its
earlier
opinions
is
separated
from
obscenity.
mr.
stanley
was
found
to
be
protected
within
wide
limits,
within
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
even
on
that
however,
there
are
i
think
some
limits
and
this
maybe
shown
by
a
case
which
crossed
my
desk
last
week
and
is
before
the
court.
this
is
reidel
against
the
united
states
no.
6266,
this
term
where
a
man
was
legally
arrested
in
his
own
apartment.
if
you
remember
in
stanley,
there
was
a
valid
search
warrant
to
search
the
apartment.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
a
sort
of
shotgun
was
in
plain
view
and
this
was
seized
by
the
police.
his
conviction
for
possession
of
an
unregistered
sort
of
shotgun
was
affirmed
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals.
apparently,
it
is
not
the
privacy
alone
which
is
the
test,
but
privacy
in
association
with
ideas
regardless
of
the
character
of
the
ideas.
the
significant
point,
i
think,
is
that
it
is
not
the
material
which
is
protected
by
stanley,
just
as
sort
of
shutdown
was
not
protected
in
the
biddle
case.
it
is
the
man
in
his
house,
it
was
not
the
obscene
film
which
was
the
object
of
this
court’s
concern,
it
was
the
knock
on
the
door,
the
intrusion
on
privacy
under
a
warrant
which
did
not
in
anyway
referred
to
the
material
actually
seized.
this
was
indeed
very
closely
parallel
to
situation
in
mapp
against
ohio
where
a
similar
results
were
reached
quashing
of
the
conviction
though
by
a
some
what
different
root.
as
one
author
has
said,
quoted
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
“the
privilege
recognized
in
stanley
is
in
short,
a
shield
for
the
private
citizen
not
a
sword
for
the
prevail.”
there
is,
we
submit
no
right
to
be
let
alone
in
a
custom
search
at
the
nation’s
borders.
at
that
point,
a
man
is
not
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home
or
sitting
in
his
own
house
to
use
the
phrases
used
by
the
court
in
the
stanley
opinion,
mr.
stanley
was
accused
of
a
crime,
here,
no
crime
is
charged.
the
procedures
in
rem
against
the
merchandise.
congress
is
exercising
its
undoubted
power
to
exclude
what
it
deems
not
just
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
which
in
itself
can
claim
no
first
amendment
protection.
once
beyond
the
custom’s
barrier,
materials
cannot
be
retrieved
no
matter
how
they
are
used.
the
importation
here
was
for
a
commercial
purpose
but
this
court’s
decision
should
not
turn
on
that
fact.
what
is
important
here
was
that
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy,
no
entry
into
a
man’s
home
in
either
case.
i
now
turn
to
the
second
question
covered
in
our
brief.
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
commercial
importation.
instead,
it
held
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
applied
to
an
importation
for
private
use
relying
on
stanley.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
but
one
i
believe
mr.
justice,
it's
very
widespread,
it’s
recited
at
length
in
the
appendices
to
the
brief
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
i
believe
there
is
one
case
which
has
narrowed
the
extension
of
stanley.
it
has
been
from
our
point
of
view
a
very
insidious
disease.
the
court
below
held
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
apply
the
statute
in
this
case,
to
an
importation
for
private
use
relying
on
stanley
and
then
held
that
the
claimant
here
could
attack
the
statute
on
that
ground
even
though
his
importation
was
avowedly
a
commercial
one.
as
i’ve
indicated,
we
think
the
court
was
wrong
in
its
decision
as
to
importation
for
private
use.
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
legitimately
a
difference
between
importations
for
commercial
or
for
private
use
or
that
the
stanley
case
so
requires.
but
that
question
is
involved
in
the
united
against
1200
foot
reels
of
film,
no.
364
of
this
term
and
in
the
united
states
against
various
articles
of
obscene
merchandise,
number
706
this
term
which
are
now
pending
on
jurisdictional
statement
but
there
is
no
justification
we
submit
for
denying
the
application
of
the
statute
to
an
avowed
commercial
and
imported
merely
because
there
may
be
a
question
in
another
application
of
the
statute.
the
statute
itself
has
a
clear
and
broad
separability
clause
applicable
not
only
to
provisions
of
the
statute
but
to
application
to
persons
and
places
and
this
should
be
applied
here.
it
would
be
improper
to
strike
down
the
entire
statute,
we
submit
as
the
court
below
did
at
the
behest
of
one
to
whom
it
validly
applies.
and
finally,
i
come
to
the
question
arising
under
freedman
against
maryland
and
under
the
recent
application
of
that
decision
in
the
mailbox
case
of
last
week.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
our
position
although
we
don’t
have
to
sustain
that
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
when
it
was
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home,
sitting
by
his
own
fire.
the
man’s
home
is
his
castle
idea
seems
to
me
to
be
central
to
the
stanley
decision.
however
i
point
out
that
that
issue
is
not
involved
here
directly
because
this
importation
was
avowedly
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
saying
that
stanley
is
an
obscenity
or
most
at
all
but
i
put
in
the
sort
of
shotgun
to
shows
that
stanley
doesn’t
protect
everything
in
the
home.
what
it
really
shows
is
that
stanley
doesn’t
protect
the
material.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
think
--
i
repeat,
there’s
a
lot
of
first
amendment
language
in
stanley
but
i
don’t
know
that
the
case
has
been
rested
on
the
first
amendment
and
if
so,
i
don’t
know
the
clause
or
the
wording
in
the
first
amendment
which
is
applicable
to
it
and
which
covers
it.
it
can
be
rested
it
seems
to
me
only
on
some
sort
of
a
penumbra
over
the
first
amendment
and
i
find
penumbras
rather
cloudy
i
think
and
it
isn’t
clear
to
me
--
i
am
satisfied
with
the
result
in
stanley
but
it
isn’t
clear
to
me
just
what
the
verbalization
is
which
firmly
supports
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
respect
to
importation
for
private
purposes,
there
maybe
even
more
than
two,
i’ve
been
trying
to
hold
these
off
but
when
lower
courts
won’t
grant
injunctions
and
won’t
grant
stays,
and
the
consequence
and
in
rem
matter
is,
that
it
is
imported
and
you
lose
jurisdiction,
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
file
a
number
of
jurisdictional
statements
which
i
hope
can
simply
be
held
in
advance
until
the
issue
is
determined.
with
respect
to
the
freedman
problem,
the
procedural
system
involved
in
this
case
affords
we
submit,
the
protection
with
freedman
and
its
progeny
require.
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proof
throughout,
not
merely
the
burden
of
proof
but
the
burden
of
taking
action.
it
must
secure
judicial
condemnation
of
any
material
it
seeks
to
buy.
the
periods
of
time
involved
are
the
shortest
which
are
compatible
with
sound
resolution
of
the
question
of
obscenity.
that
is
shown
by
the
situation
in
this
case
where
the
importation
was
on
october
24,
1969.
one
week
later,
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
forfeiture
action
and
to
get
this
government
to
move
within
one
week
is
a
remarkable
achievement
and
the
claimant
was
so
advised.
on
november
6
or
13
days
after
the
importation,
the
united
states
commenced
the
present
action
in
the
court.
any
further
delays
had
been
required
by
judicial
proceedings
and
had
been
affected
by
the
fact
that
the
claimants
sought
a
hearing
by
a
three-judge
court.
if
the
claimant
had
been
willing
simply
to
go
to
trial
on
the
issue
of
obscenity,
as
a
case
cited
in
a
footnote,
and
our
brief
shows,
the
whole
matter
could’ve
been
disposed
off
within
two
to
three
months
at
the
outside.
although
fixed
time
limits
are
not
prescribed
by
the
statute.
statutory
provisions
do
require
custom’s
agents
to
report
their
actions
on
these
matters
“immediately,”
to
the
collector.
and
when
the
matter
is
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney,
another
statutory
provision
directs
him
to
start
and
prosecute
the
proceedings
“forthwith
without
delay.”
the
latter
provision
is
section
1604
in
title
19
of
the
u.s.
code.
the
only
gap
in
this
procedure
is
with
respect
to
the
collector’s
transmission
of
the
case
to
the
united
states
attorney.
this
is
however
covered
by
a
bureau
of
customs’
circular
cited
in
the
footnote
to
page
26
of
our
brief,
which
was
developed
by
the
customs’
bureau
and
the
department
of
justice
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
delays.
now,
that
circular
provision,
it
seems
to
me
is
worth
looking
at.
it’s
the
footnote
on
page
26,
it
provides
that
the
first
examination
shall
be
made
“as
soon
as
possible,”
after
it’s
available
for
customs’
examination.
if
the
first
examining
officer
concludes
that
it
is
something
that
should
be
looked
into,
it
shall
be
reviewed
by
the
district
director
or
his
delegate
“no
later
than
the
following
business
day.”
if
at
any
review
the
material
is
determined
not
to
be
obscene,
it
shall
be
released.
if
at
any
review
the
material
is
determined
to
be
obscene,
and
assent
to
forfeiture
shall
be
solicited
“forthwith.”
if
dissent
is
not
forthcoming
“within
one
week,”
or
if
assent
is
declined,
the
material
shall
be
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
immediately.
and
if
it
is
felt
that
the
material
is
probably
obscene
but
there
is
no
clear
precedent
for
the
determination,
the
material
shall
immediately
be
forward
for
review
by
the
bureau,
by
the
most
expeditious
means.
this
procedure
worked
well
in
this
case
both
administratively
and
judicially.
moreover,
the
materials
here
have
a
sort
of
timeless
quality.
they
are
not
like
news
or
even
like
a
current
motion
picture
film.
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
have
commercial
value
if
they
can
be
use
commercially.
and
i
do
not
think
that
value
can
be
said
to
be
lessened
by
the
lapse
of
time.
there
will
no
doubt
always
be
audiences
for
such
items.
as
they
were
in
greece
and
(inaudible).
i
do
not
say
this
to
excuse
delay
because
i
do
not
think
there
was
in
fact
inappropriate
delay
on
this
case
or
any
delay
that
is
held
invalid
by
the
freedman
case.
it
is
simply
that
i
think
that
the
time
pressures
on
these
facts
may
well
be
less
than
they
would
be
in
some
other
case
not
now
before
the
court.
the
period
here
was
we
submit
completely
consistent
with
prompt
yet
responsible
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings
on
the
issue
of
the
obscenity
of
the
material
seized.
and
for
these
reasons,
because
stanley
against
georgia
does
not
apply
to
this
case
where
no
privacy
of
the
home
is
involved,
because
the
importation
here
was
commercial
and
the
claimant
should
not
be
allowed
to
assert
any
defect
in
the
statute,
if
there
is
one
in
its
application
to
importation
for
private
use,
and
because
the
requirements
of
freedman
against
maryland
were
met
here,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
an
administrative
within
the
treasury
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
nothing
like
that
all
and
it
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
necessary
and
appropriate
administrative
determination
as
to
whether
the
matter
shall
be
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
starting
judicial
proceedings
forthwith.
there
is
no
binding
determination
of
any
sort
within
the
treasury
except
that
the
matter
shall
be
forwarded
to
the
u.s.
attorney.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
the
obscenity
has
not
been
passed
on
by
the
lower
court
and
is
not
involved
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
go
back
to
the
trail
court
presumably
a
one
judge
district
court
then
for
determination
of
that
issue
as
it
was
done
in
another
case
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
time
i
have
available,
i
want
to
make
only
two
points.
first
in
my
principal
argument,
i
said
that
i
was
not
aware
of
any
cases
which
had
taken
our
view
with
respect
to
stanley
and
on
that
i
was
wrong,
i
think
it
is
a
mechanic
of
the
solicitor
general’s
office
that
i
see
the
case
if
we
lose
and
don’t
see
the
cases
if
we
win.
there
are
in
fact
three
decisions
of
courts
of
appeals,
all
of
which
i
think
can
be
distinguished
somewhere
on
their
facts,
one
of
them
is
a
clear
case
of
pandering
and
another
could
be
said
to
be
pandering.
but
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
all
held
that
stanley
should
not
be
enlarged
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
submit
a
memorandum
to
the
clerk
which
gives
the
citations
in
these
cases.
i
would
like
only
to
read
from
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
in
united
states
against
melvin
in
419
u.s.
the
cases
stanley
against
georgia
decided
this
year
and
relied
upon
by
the
appellant
is
not
to
the
contrary.
there
the
supreme
court
merely
stuck
down
the
statute
as
unconstitutional,
insofar
as
it
made
criminal,
the
mere
private
possession
of
obscene
material
in
one’s
own
home,
the
decision
did
not
deal
with
congressional
power
to
regulate
the
interstate
transportation
of
obscene
material
by
common
carrier.
and
then
finally,
there
is
a
three-judge
district
court
decision
in--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
that
happens
to
be
a
transport
by
common
carrier
case
which
is
like
the
next
case
we’re
going
to
present
to
the
court
which
is
mail
but
i
think
the
principle
of
the
extended
stanley
is
exactly
parallel
in
all
of
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
in
the
united
states
against
melvin,
the
one
to
which
i
just
referred
419
federal
second,
136
a
fourth
circuit
decision,
fragus
against
united
states
428
f.2d
1211,
a
fifth
circuit
decision
and
plainly
involving
pandering
and
miller
against
the
united
states
431
f.2d
655
a
ninth
circuit
decision
and
then
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
georgia,
gable
against
jenkins,
309
federal
supplement
998,
which
also
took
a
narrower
or
a
non-expensive
view
of
stanley.
it
was
appealed
to
this
court
and
this
court
affirmed
the
decision
below
per
curiam
in
397
u.s
205
and
that
should
surely
have
been
cited
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
only
to
say
in
conclusion
that
i
think
there
is
verbal
explanations
for
these
words
in
the
stanley
opinion
which
have
caused
us
trouble.
the
court
in
stanley
said
and
spoke
twice
of
the
right
to
receive
information
or
ideas
but
in
the
roth
decision,
the
court
said
that
obscenity
is
not
ideas
or
information
and
so
that
language
in
stanley
may
have
been
very
carefully
chosen
to
exclude
the
right
to
receive
obscenity.
it’s
true
that
in
the
stanley
case,
the
court
said--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
affirmance
mr.
justice
is
in
397
u.s.
205.
two
members
of
the
court
who
thought
the
probably
jurisdiction
should
be
noted
but
the
court
affirmed
the
decision.
in
the
stanley
case,
it
is
true
that
the
court
said
it
would
not
decide
whether
the
movies
in
stanley
had
ideational
content
that
is
constituted
information
and
ideas
under
the
facts
of
that
case
because
of
the
risk
to
stanley’s
first
amendment
rights
inherent
in
that
inquiry.
but
that
again,
returned
one
to
stanley’s
right
not
to
have
his
thoughts
pride
into.
we
need
not
concede
and
do
not
that
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas
referred
to
in
the
stanley
opinion
included
the
films
there
involved.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
an
appeal
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
central
district
of
california.
the
case
is
a
customs
seizure
case.
the
claimant
returned
to
this
country
by
air
on
october
24,
1969
arriving
in
los
angeles.
during
customs
inspection,
the
thirty-seven
photographs
involved
here
were
seized
together
with
certain
other
items.
all
but
the
photographs
have
been
returned
and
only
the
seizure
of
the
photographs
is
involved
here.
it
is
stipulated
and
that
the
photographs
were
intended
to
be
incorporated
into
a
hard
covered
book
and
i
quote
from
page
16
of
the
record
in
the
stipulation,
which
book
describes
candidly
a
large
number
of
sexual
positions.
on
october
31,
i
may
say
the
photographs
have
been
lodged
with
the
cleric
of
the
court.
on
october
31,
1969,
the
district
director
of
customs
advised
the
claimant
luros
that
the
matter
had
been
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
forfeiture
action.
on
november
4,
the
claimant’s
attorney
demanded
the
return
of
the
photographs.
on
november
6,
13
days
after
the
arrival
in
los
angeles,
the
united
states
started
this
action
for
forfeiture,
under
title
19
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1305(a),
a
statutory
provision
which
is
printed
at
pages
2-4
of
our
brief.
eight
days
later,
the
claimant
filed
an
answer
and
counter
claim
contending
that
the
photographs
were
not
obscene
and
that
the
statutory
provision
was
unconstitutional.
he
moved
for
a
three-judge
court
because
he
sought
a
declaration
and
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
and
in
order
to
convene,
a
three-judge
court
was
entered
on
november
20,
1969.
the
hearing
was
held
on
january
9,
1970
and
the
three-judge
court’s
opinion
was
issued
on
january
27,
1970.
the
court
treated
the
motion
for
injunction
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
assumed
that
the
pictures
are
obscene.
that
issue
has
never
been
adjudicated
and
is
not
directly
involved
here.
what
the
court
did
was
to
rule
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
it
reached
this
conclusion
by
an
application
or
perhaps
one
can
fairly
say
by
an
extension
of
this
court’s
decision
in
stanley
against
georgia,
in
394
u.s.
although,
the
claimant
had
stipulated
that
he
imported
the
pictures
for
commercial
use.
the
court
held
that
he
had
standing
to
attack
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
its
application
to
importation
for
private
use,
to
which
it
said
the
stanley
case
applied.
the
court
also
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
under
freedman
against
maryland
in
380
u.s.
because
it
failed
to
guarantee
that
any
restraint
on
allegedly
obscene
material
would
be
imposed
for
only
a
specified
brief
period
prior
to
judicial
resolution
of
the
issue
of
“obscenity”.
the
first
question,
i
wish
to
present
is
that
with
respect
to
stanley
against
georgia.
that
case
was
won
as
the
court
observed
in
the
opinion
of
first
impression.
the
court
wrote
a
careful
opinion
which
was
narrowly
limited.
but
in
less
than
two
years,
it
has
proliferated
in
the
lower
courts,
afar
beyond
anything
that
was
presaged
in
this
court’s
opinion.
from
protection
to
a
man
in
his
home,
it
has
blossomed
out
to
cover
the
whole
world.
that
extension
is
involved
in
this
case
in
the
reidel
case
which
is
the
next
on
the
calendar,
and
in
several
other
cases
which
we
have
felt
it
necessary
to
bring
to
the
court
and
in
many
others
which
are
pending
in
lower
courts
awaiting
this
court’s
decision.
it’s
also
involved
in
the
case
of
burn
against
carolexis
(ph)
at
number
83
which
was
argued
last
term
and
re-argued
on
november
17th.
stanley
against
georgia
is
obviously
an
important
case,
one
that
will
be
discussed
for
many
years
to
come.
it
has
roots
in
the
boyd
case
of
8
years
ago
and
justice
brandeis's
dissent
in
the
olmstead
case,
in
justice
harlan’s
dissent
peo
against
ullman,
in
justice
stewart’s
memorandum
in
mapp
against
ohio
and
in
this
court’s
decision
in
griswold
against
connecticut.
it
is
not
the
worst
for
the
fact
that
its
conclusion
has
never
been
firmly
bound
to
the
text
of
any
particular
constitutional
provision.
that
fact
may
indicate
however
that
those
sound
in
result,
the
verbalization
may
be
subject
to
further
refinement
as
applied
to
particular
new
situations.
in
the
stanley
opinion
itself,
the
court
seemed
to
cover
a
case
such
as
this.
it
distinguished
in
earlier
cases
on
the
ground
that
they
and
i
quote,
“deal
for
the
most
part
with
the
use
of
the
mails
to
distribute
objectionable
material
or
was
some
sort
of
public
distribution
or
dissemination,”.
that
appears
in
page
561
of
394
u.s.
it
referred
to
other
cases
as
dealing
and
i
quote,
“with
the
power
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
to
prohibit
or
regulate
certain
public
actions
taken
or
intended
to
be
taken
with
respect
to
obscene
matter.
citing
prosecutions
for
sale
and
distribution,”
that
likewise
is
on
page
561.
it
referred
to
this
court’s
decision
in
the
roth
case
as
involving
and
i
quote,
“the
regulation
of
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
material.”
that’s
on
pages
563
and
564.
and
finally
the
court
specifically
stated
that
and
again
i
quote,
“roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today’s
holding,”.
this
seems
clear
enough
and
it
seems
clearly
applicable
to
the
present
case
which
after
all
involves
importation
and
area
traditionally
subject
to
close
control
by
congress
and
importation
for
commercial
purposes.
the
difficulty
arises
because
of
some
passages
in
the
opinion
which
i
think
must
be
regarded
as
passing
references
and
not
central
to
the
decision
itself.
the
court
did
say
that
and
i
quote,
“it
is
now
well
established
that
the
constitution
protects
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas.”
and
a
little
later
on
in
the
same
paragraph,
the
court
said
that
and
i
quote,
“this
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas
regardless
of
their
social
worth
is
fundamental
to
our
free
society.
that
is
fairly
strong
language
but
even
that
refers
to
the
recipient
and
does
not
assert
any
such
right
to
distribute.”
a
little
later,
the
court
referred
to
“the
transmission
of
ideas.”
but
the
essence
of
this
court’s
decision,
we
submit
is
found
in
it’s
concern
for
mr.
stanley.
it
referred
to
a
man
sitting
alone
in
his
own
home
and
in
his
own
house.
it
referred
to
his
right
to
satisfy
his
intellectual
and
emotional
needs
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
the
majority
of
the
court
used
some
first
amendment
language.
other
members
of
the
court
preferred
to
express
the
conclusion
in
fourth
amendment
terms.
perhaps
it
could
fairly
be
said
here
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
suffice.
but
it
was
mr.
stanley
who
was
protected
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home,
it
was
not
the
materials.
they
are
still
expressly
subject
to
roth.
indeed
it
was
only
last
thursday
in
the
mailbox’s
case
that
the
court
reiterated
its
previous
determination
that
constitutionally
protected
expression
is
separated,
and
that
is
the
word
use
by
the
court
in
quoting
from
one
of
its
earlier
opinions
is
separated
from
obscenity.
mr.
stanley
was
found
to
be
protected
within
wide
limits,
within
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
even
on
that
however,
there
are
i
think
some
limits
and
this
maybe
shown
by
a
case
which
crossed
my
desk
last
week
and
is
before
the
court.
this
is
reidel
against
the
united
states
no.
6266,
this
term
where
a
man
was
legally
arrested
in
his
own
apartment.
if
you
remember
in
stanley,
there
was
a
valid
search
warrant
to
search
the
apartment.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
a
sort
of
shotgun
was
in
plain
view
and
this
was
seized
by
the
police.
his
conviction
for
possession
of
an
unregistered
sort
of
shotgun
was
affirmed
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals.
apparently,
it
is
not
the
privacy
alone
which
is
the
test,
but
privacy
in
association
with
ideas
regardless
of
the
character
of
the
ideas.
the
significant
point,
i
think,
is
that
it
is
not
the
material
which
is
protected
by
stanley,
just
as
sort
of
shutdown
was
not
protected
in
the
biddle
case.
it
is
the
man
in
his
house,
it
was
not
the
obscene
film
which
was
the
object
of
this
court’s
concern,
it
was
the
knock
on
the
door,
the
intrusion
on
privacy
under
a
warrant
which
did
not
in
anyway
referred
to
the
material
actually
seized.
this
was
indeed
very
closely
parallel
to
situation
in
mapp
against
ohio
where
a
similar
results
were
reached
quashing
of
the
conviction
though
by
a
some
what
different
root.
as
one
author
has
said,
quoted
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
“the
privilege
recognized
in
stanley
is
in
short,
a
shield
for
the
private
citizen
not
a
sword
for
the
prevail.”
there
is,
we
submit
no
right
to
be
let
alone
in
a
custom
search
at
the
nation’s
borders.
at
that
point,
a
man
is
not
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home
or
sitting
in
his
own
house
to
use
the
phrases
used
by
the
court
in
the
stanley
opinion,
mr.
stanley
was
accused
of
a
crime,
here,
no
crime
is
charged.
the
procedures
in
rem
against
the
merchandise.
congress
is
exercising
its
undoubted
power
to
exclude
what
it
deems
not
just
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
which
in
itself
can
claim
no
first
amendment
protection.
once
beyond
the
custom’s
barrier,
materials
cannot
be
retrieved
no
matter
how
they
are
used.
the
importation
here
was
for
a
commercial
purpose
but
this
court’s
decision
should
not
turn
on
that
fact.
what
is
important
here
was
that
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy,
no
entry
into
a
man’s
home
in
either
case.
i
now
turn
to
the
second
question
covered
in
our
brief.
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
commercial
importation.
instead,
it
held
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
applied
to
an
importation
for
private
use
relying
on
stanley.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
but
one
i
believe
mr.
justice,
it's
very
widespread,
it’s
recited
at
length
in
the
appendices
to
the
brief
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
i
believe
there
is
one
case
which
has
narrowed
the
extension
of
stanley.
it
has
been
from
our
point
of
view
a
very
insidious
disease.
the
court
below
held
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
apply
the
statute
in
this
case,
to
an
importation
for
private
use
relying
on
stanley
and
then
held
that
the
claimant
here
could
attack
the
statute
on
that
ground
even
though
his
importation
was
avowedly
a
commercial
one.
as
i’ve
indicated,
we
think
the
court
was
wrong
in
its
decision
as
to
importation
for
private
use.
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
legitimately
a
difference
between
importations
for
commercial
or
for
private
use
or
that
the
stanley
case
so
requires.
but
that
question
is
involved
in
the
united
against
1200
foot
reels
of
film,
no.
364
of
this
term
and
in
the
united
states
against
various
articles
of
obscene
merchandise,
number
706
this
term
which
are
now
pending
on
jurisdictional
statement
but
there
is
no
justification
we
submit
for
denying
the
application
of
the
statute
to
an
avowed
commercial
and
imported
merely
because
there
may
be
a
question
in
another
application
of
the
statute.
the
statute
itself
has
a
clear
and
broad
separability
clause
applicable
not
only
to
provisions
of
the
statute
but
to
application
to
persons
and
places
and
this
should
be
applied
here.
it
would
be
improper
to
strike
down
the
entire
statute,
we
submit
as
the
court
below
did
at
the
behest
of
one
to
whom
it
validly
applies.
and
finally,
i
come
to
the
question
arising
under
freedman
against
maryland
and
under
the
recent
application
of
that
decision
in
the
mailbox
case
of
last
week.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
our
position
although
we
don’t
have
to
sustain
that
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
when
it
was
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home,
sitting
by
his
own
fire.
the
man’s
home
is
his
castle
idea
seems
to
me
to
be
central
to
the
stanley
decision.
however
i
point
out
that
that
issue
is
not
involved
here
directly
because
this
importation
was
avowedly
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
saying
that
stanley
is
an
obscenity
or
most
at
all
but
i
put
in
the
sort
of
shotgun
to
shows
that
stanley
doesn’t
protect
everything
in
the
home.
what
it
really
shows
is
that
stanley
doesn’t
protect
the
material.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
think
--
i
repeat,
there’s
a
lot
of
first
amendment
language
in
stanley
but
i
don’t
know
that
the
case
has
been
rested
on
the
first
amendment
and
if
so,
i
don’t
know
the
clause
or
the
wording
in
the
first
amendment
which
is
applicable
to
it
and
which
covers
it.
it
can
be
rested
it
seems
to
me
only
on
some
sort
of
a
penumbra
over
the
first
amendment
and
i
find
penumbras
rather
cloudy
i
think
and
it
isn’t
clear
to
me
--
i
am
satisfied
with
the
result
in
stanley
but
it
isn’t
clear
to
me
just
what
the
verbalization
is
which
firmly
supports
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
respect
to
importation
for
private
purposes,
there
maybe
even
more
than
two,
i’ve
been
trying
to
hold
these
off
but
when
lower
courts
won’t
grant
injunctions
and
won’t
grant
stays,
and
the
consequence
and
in
rem
matter
is,
that
it
is
imported
and
you
lose
jurisdiction,
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
file
a
number
of
jurisdictional
statements
which
i
hope
can
simply
be
held
in
advance
until
the
issue
is
determined.
with
respect
to
the
freedman
problem,
the
procedural
system
involved
in
this
case
affords
we
submit,
the
protection
with
freedman
and
its
progeny
require.
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proof
throughout,
not
merely
the
burden
of
proof
but
the
burden
of
taking
action.
it
must
secure
judicial
condemnation
of
any
material
it
seeks
to
buy.
the
periods
of
time
involved
are
the
shortest
which
are
compatible
with
sound
resolution
of
the
question
of
obscenity.
that
is
shown
by
the
situation
in
this
case
where
the
importation
was
on
october
24,
1969.
one
week
later,
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
forfeiture
action
and
to
get
this
government
to
move
within
one
week
is
a
remarkable
achievement
and
the
claimant
was
so
advised.
on
november
6
or
13
days
after
the
importation,
the
united
states
commenced
the
present
action
in
the
court.
any
further
delays
had
been
required
by
judicial
proceedings
and
had
been
affected
by
the
fact
that
the
claimants
sought
a
hearing
by
a
three-judge
court.
if
the
claimant
had
been
willing
simply
to
go
to
trial
on
the
issue
of
obscenity,
as
a
case
cited
in
a
footnote,
and
our
brief
shows,
the
whole
matter
could’ve
been
disposed
off
within
two
to
three
months
at
the
outside.
although
fixed
time
limits
are
not
prescribed
by
the
statute.
statutory
provisions
do
require
custom’s
agents
to
report
their
actions
on
these
matters
“immediately,”
to
the
collector.
and
when
the
matter
is
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney,
another
statutory
provision
directs
him
to
start
and
prosecute
the
proceedings
“forthwith
without
delay.”
the
latter
provision
is
section
1604
in
title
19
of
the
u.s.
code.
the
only
gap
in
this
procedure
is
with
respect
to
the
collector’s
transmission
of
the
case
to
the
united
states
attorney.
this
is
however
covered
by
a
bureau
of
customs’
circular
cited
in
the
footnote
to
page
26
of
our
brief,
which
was
developed
by
the
customs’
bureau
and
the
department
of
justice
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
delays.
now,
that
circular
provision,
it
seems
to
me
is
worth
looking
at.
it’s
the
footnote
on
page
26,
it
provides
that
the
first
examination
shall
be
made
“as
soon
as
possible,”
after
it’s
available
for
customs’
examination.
if
the
first
examining
officer
concludes
that
it
is
something
that
should
be
looked
into,
it
shall
be
reviewed
by
the
district
director
or
his
delegate
“no
later
than
the
following
business
day.”
if
at
any
review
the
material
is
determined
not
to
be
obscene,
it
shall
be
released.
if
at
any
review
the
material
is
determined
to
be
obscene,
and
assent
to
forfeiture
shall
be
solicited
“forthwith.”
if
dissent
is
not
forthcoming
“within
one
week,”
or
if
assent
is
declined,
the
material
shall
be
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
immediately.
and
if
it
is
felt
that
the
material
is
probably
obscene
but
there
is
no
clear
precedent
for
the
determination,
the
material
shall
immediately
be
forward
for
review
by
the
bureau,
by
the
most
expeditious
means.
this
procedure
worked
well
in
this
case
both
administratively
and
judicially.
moreover,
the
materials
here
have
a
sort
of
timeless
quality.
they
are
not
like
news
or
even
like
a
current
motion
picture
film.
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
have
commercial
value
if
they
can
be
use
commercially.
and
i
do
not
think
that
value
can
be
said
to
be
lessened
by
the
lapse
of
time.
there
will
no
doubt
always
be
audiences
for
such
items.
as
they
were
in
greece
and
(inaudible).
i
do
not
say
this
to
excuse
delay
because
i
do
not
think
there
was
in
fact
inappropriate
delay
on
this
case
or
any
delay
that
is
held
invalid
by
the
freedman
case.
it
is
simply
that
i
think
that
the
time
pressures
on
these
facts
may
well
be
less
than
they
would
be
in
some
other
case
not
now
before
the
court.
the
period
here
was
we
submit
completely
consistent
with
prompt
yet
responsible
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings
on
the
issue
of
the
obscenity
of
the
material
seized.
and
for
these
reasons,
because
stanley
against
georgia
does
not
apply
to
this
case
where
no
privacy
of
the
home
is
involved,
because
the
importation
here
was
commercial
and
the
claimant
should
not
be
allowed
to
assert
any
defect
in
the
statute,
if
there
is
one
in
its
application
to
importation
for
private
use,
and
because
the
requirements
of
freedman
against
maryland
were
met
here,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
an
administrative
within
the
treasury
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
nothing
like
that
all
and
it
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
necessary
and
appropriate
administrative
determination
as
to
whether
the
matter
shall
be
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
starting
judicial
proceedings
forthwith.
there
is
no
binding
determination
of
any
sort
within
the
treasury
except
that
the
matter
shall
be
forwarded
to
the
u.s.
attorney.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
the
obscenity
has
not
been
passed
on
by
the
lower
court
and
is
not
involved
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
go
back
to
the
trail
court
presumably
a
one
judge
district
court
then
for
determination
of
that
issue
as
it
was
done
in
another
case
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
our
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
time
i
have
available,
i
want
to
make
only
two
points.
first
in
my
principal
argument,
i
said
that
i
was
not
aware
of
any
cases
which
had
taken
our
view
with
respect
to
stanley
and
on
that
i
was
wrong,
i
think
it
is
a
mechanic
of
the
solicitor
general’s
office
that
i
see
the
case
if
we
lose
and
don’t
see
the
cases
if
we
win.
there
are
in
fact
three
decisions
of
courts
of
appeals,
all
of
which
i
think
can
be
distinguished
somewhere
on
their
facts,
one
of
them
is
a
clear
case
of
pandering
and
another
could
be
said
to
be
pandering.
but
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
all
held
that
stanley
should
not
be
enlarged
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
submit
a
memorandum
to
the
clerk
which
gives
the
citations
in
these
cases.
i
would
like
only
to
read
from
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
in
united
states
against
melvin
in
419
u.s.
the
cases
stanley
against
georgia
decided
this
year
and
relied
upon
by
the
appellant
is
not
to
the
contrary.
there
the
supreme
court
merely
stuck
down
the
statute
as
unconstitutional,
insofar
as
it
made
criminal,
the
mere
private
possession
of
obscene
material
in
one’s
own
home,
the
decision
did
not
deal
with
congressional
power
to
regulate
the
interstate
transportation
of
obscene
material
by
common
carrier.
and
then
finally,
there
is
a
three-judge
district
court
decision
in--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
that
happens
to
be
a
transport
by
common
carrier
case
which
is
like
the
next
case
we’re
going
to
present
to
the
court
which
is
mail
but
i
think
the
principle
of
the
extended
stanley
is
exactly
parallel
in
all
of
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
in
the
united
states
against
melvin,
the
one
to
which
i
just
referred
419
federal
second,
136
a
fourth
circuit
decision,
fragus
against
united
states
428
f.2d
1211,
a
fifth
circuit
decision
and
plainly
involving
pandering
and
miller
against
the
united
states
431
f.2d
655
a
ninth
circuit
decision
and
then
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
georgia,
gable
against
jenkins,
309
federal
supplement
998,
which
also
took
a
narrower
or
a
non-expensive
view
of
stanley.
it
was
appealed
to
this
court
and
this
court
affirmed
the
decision
below
per
curiam
in
397
u.s
205
and
that
should
surely
have
been
cited
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
only
to
say
in
conclusion
that
i
think
there
is
verbal
explanations
for
these
words
in
the
stanley
opinion
which
have
caused
us
trouble.
the
court
in
stanley
said
and
spoke
twice
of
the
right
to
receive
information
or
ideas
but
in
the
roth
decision,
the
court
said
that
obscenity
is
not
ideas
or
information
and
so
that
language
in
stanley
may
have
been
very
carefully
chosen
to
exclude
the
right
to
receive
obscenity.
it’s
true
that
in
the
stanley
case,
the
court
said--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
affirmance
mr.
justice
is
in
397
u.s.
205.
two
members
of
the
court
who
thought
the
probably
jurisdiction
should
be
noted
but
the
court
affirmed
the
decision.
in
the
stanley
case,
it
is
true
that
the
court
said
it
would
not
decide
whether
the
movies
in
stanley
had
ideational
content
that
is
constituted
information
and
ideas
under
the
facts
of
that
case
because
of
the
risk
to
stanley’s
first
amendment
rights
inherent
in
that
inquiry.
but
that
again,
returned
one
to
stanley’s
right
not
to
have
his
thoughts
pride
into.
we
need
not
concede
and
do
not
that
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas
referred
to
in
the
stanley
opinion
included
the
films
there
involved.
