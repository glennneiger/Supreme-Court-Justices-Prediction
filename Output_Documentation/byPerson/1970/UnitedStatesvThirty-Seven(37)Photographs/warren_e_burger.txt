chief

warren
e.
burger
solicitor
general,
before
you
leave
the
stanley,
have
all
the
lower
court,
have
they
been
uniformed
in
giving
what
you
call
this
standard
due
stanley?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
on
with
that
mr.
solicitor
general,
let
me
see
if
i
clarify
that
last
point.
your
statement
goes
there’s
no
difference
in
an
importation
case.
we
put
in
another
way
there.
the
purpose,
the
intended
use
is
irrelevant
in
an
importation
case
i
take
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
casual
tourist
coming
back
with
the
same
material
for
the
private
use
in
his
home
is
not
protected
by
stanley
at
least
you
argued
because
stanley
protected
it
only
when
it
was
in
his
home.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you’re
saying
is
that
stanley
isn’t
an
obscenity
case
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
part
of
the
obscenity
of
the
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
prevail
this
case
it
goes
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fleishman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
certification
that
you
speak
of
the
protection
is
that
the
purchaser
must
certify
that
he’s
over
21
or
over?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
relating
now
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
questioning
to
you
when
you
called
it
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fleishman,
do
you
mean
that
in
the
sense
that
it’s
important
in
its
impact
in
obscenity
per
se?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
the
solicitor
general
said,
at
least
i
didn't
hear
him
say
that
that
was
an
important
case
in
obscenity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
the
court
say
that
or
did
the
court
merely
indicate
at
whole
that
congress
permissibly
has
such
a
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you’re
making
is
the
court
didn’t
invent
that
concept
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
for
constitution.
it
didn't
violate
the
constitution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fleishman.
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don’t
you
think
you
could
have
a
little
more
precise
definition
of
a
classic
on
that
in
the
abstract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
it’s
not
for
a
criminal
statute
but
i
think
don't
you
think
it
could
be
a
little
bit
less
expensive
than
you
suggest
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
