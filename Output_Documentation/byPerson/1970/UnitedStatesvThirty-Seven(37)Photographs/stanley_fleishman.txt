mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
when
mr.
luros
was
returning
from
europe.
he
had
in
his
luggage
the
37
photographs
involved
in
this
case.
he
also
had
the
two
odd
books,
one,
a
rollingsons
and
one
of
peter
fendi
and
he
also
had
a
girlie
magazine.
the
customs’
inspector
made
his
snap
judgment
and
found
all
of
these
items
to
be
obscene.
after
we
intervened
in
the
case
as
the
government
did
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
did
return
everything
except
the
37
photographs.
it
was
stipulated
that
the
photographs
were
intended
to
be
used
in
the
kama
sutra;
a
book
which
the
customs
used
to
think
was
obscene
but
no
longer
believes
to
be
obscene.
we
call
to
the
attention
of
customs
at
the
time
by
letter
that
the
use
of
the
book
would
be
private
in
the
sense
that
it
was
to
be
distributed
only
to
consenting
adults
under
such
circumstances
that
it
would
not
offend
the
general
public.
this
was
not
to
be
distributed
broadside.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
it
can
be
accomplished
by
inviting
people
who
are
interested
in
buying
an
illustrated
kama
sutra
to
write
in
and
say
that
they
would
like
to
purchase
such
a
book
and
to
have
adequate
safeguards
that
the
person
is
an
adult.
under
those
circumstances,
it’s
a
private
person
who
privately
elects
to
read
a
book
illustrated.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
an
adult
that
it
defers.
of
course
that’s
not
in
occasional
although
it
was
in
the
case,
it’s
all
let
into
the
customs
and
now
pleaded.
our
pleading
is
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
your
honor,
one
can
protect
it
in
a
lot
of
ways.
i
have
clients
who
require
adults
to
send
in
a
statement
with
some
kind
of
proof
as
to
their
age.
some
clients
require,
for
example,
that
they
send
in
a
copy
of
their
driver’s
license.
so
that
there
are
ways
where
you
can
assure
yourself
that
it
will
in
fact
be
to
consenting
adults
only.
the
point
that
i’m
making
is
that
this
case
really
is
a
privacy
case
in
the
same
sense
if
we
will,
that
it
was
privacy
in
mr.
stanley’s
situation.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
page
19,
your
honor
there
is
a
copy
of
my
letter
and
it
states
that
it
was
to
be
distributed
in
the
fashion
that
i
have
indicated.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
material
is
not
being
imported
for
distribution
to
minors
nor
to
be
trusted
upon
unwilling
dealers
and
it
is
spelled
out
a
little
bit
more
fully
in
our
answer
to
the
complaint
and
our
cross
complaint
which
also
sets
forth
the
intention.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
the
letter
was
part
of
the
stipulation.
yes
that
was
attached
to
the
stipulation
your
honor.
that
is
exhibit
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
this
is
appendix
c,
your
honor
to
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
said
that
i
wrote
this
letter
and
that
this
was
the
content.
so
as
we
come
knowing
in
this
case,
it’s
stipulated
that
customs
was
told
that
this
was
the
intended
purpose
of
the
distribution.
now,
the
case
your
honor
is
not
the
case
as
set
forth
in
the
government’s
brief
of
the
power
to
regulate
customs
and
foreign
trade.
we
conceive
that
of
course,
government
does
have
a
broad
power
to
exclude
materials
all
we
say
is
that
government
in
this
area
is
an
all
area
as
circumscribed
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that
it
may
not
pass
a
shotgun
law
such
as
the
customs
law
here
which
prohibits
an
adult
from
bringing
in
which
satisfies
his;
the
emotional
needs
will
satisfy
some
informational
needs
that
he
may
have
nor
does
it
permit
that
we
submit
the
government
to
keep
such
material
from
circulating
under
the
controlled
circumstances
that
we
have
here.
the
government’s
argument
really
comes
down
to
this.
the
government
states
that,
“roth
held
in
the
first
instance
that
obscenity
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
then
as
if
nothing
else
has
happened
since
roth,
as
if
there
hadn’t
been
really
dozens
and
dozens
of
cases
with
refinements
and
nuances
and
cutbacks,
as
if
nothing
had
happened
since
roth,
they
mechanically
argued
that
obscenity
is
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
can
be
handled
exactly
as
any
other
merchandise.
that
is
the
burden
of
the
government’s
argument.
the
solicitor
general
here
interestingly
calls
to
our
attention
the
biddle
case
which
seems
to
me
to
show
what
is
obvious
that
a
book
or
other
matter
of
communication
cannot
be
treated
and
never
has
been
treated
by
this
court,
the
same
as
shotguns
or
gambling
devices
or
the
like.
i’d
like
to
spend,
if
i
may
a
moment
in
terms
of
roth
and
what
has
happened
since
roth
because
i
think
that
we
cannot
fairly
evaluate
stanley
without
such
a
background
and
i
agree
completely
with
the
solicitor
general
that
stanley
is
a
very
important
case
and
a
case
which
will
be
looked
at
for
many
years
to
come.
as
i
stated,
in
1957
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
important
as
an
important
obscenity
case.
i
think
that
stanley
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i
believe
he
was
suggesting
that
it
was
an
important
case
and
that
it
would
be
debated
for
a
long
period
of
time.
i
think
it
will
be
discussed
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
i
think
that
just
as
the
lower
courts
have
embraced
it
as
holding
essentially
that
adults,
consenting
adults
have
the
right
to
read
what
they
want
to
that
it
will
be
important
for
that
reason
too.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
oh,
i
would
not
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
was,
your
honor.
but
i
would
submit
in
all
deference
mr.
justice
marshall
that
just
as
a
bachelor
can
get
some
information
and
can
satisfy
some
of
his
emotional
needs
by
viewing
such
a
film,
a
married
person
may
also
get
it.
i
suspect
that
stanley
is
not
limited
to
bachelor’s
reading
or
viewing
of
such
material.
the
government
in
burn
initially
stated
that
it
was
not
only
in
the
privacy
of
one’s
home
but
also
in
an
office.
that’s
what
burn
says.
when
the
government
wrote
burn,
they
said
it
was
the
privacy
of
a
home
and
office.
well,
i
would
suspect
that
a
person
could
take
a
book
and
go
to
the
park
and
get
whatever
information
or
emotional
satisfaction
there
just
as
well.
the
crucial
point
as
i
read
and
read
stanley
is
that
government
does
have
legitimate
interests
and
those
will
be
protected
completely
but
that
those
legitimate
interests
are
narrow.
one
of
the
legitimate
interest
is
not
ever
to
tell
adults
what
they
should
read
or
what
they
should
see
and
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
they
see
it
in
a
private
boot
walk,
they
see
it
in
a
friend’s
home.
if
they
see
it
in
their
office,
the
important
thing
is,
that
it’s
not
thrust
upon
an
un-willing
audience
and
that
we
have
adequate
of
protection
to
see
that
the
material
is
not
distributed
to
minors.
and
those
are
we
submit,
the
synthesis
of
all
that
has
happened
since
roth.
now
at
the
time
of
roth,
the
court
was
faced
really
with
choices
as
the
court
has
always
faced.
there
were
three
arguments
that
were
being
put
forward.
i
was
here
then
and
i
was
making
an
absolutist
argument.
i
was
saying
that
obscenity
was
absolutely
protected.
there
was,
and
before
the
house,
the
whole
(inaudible)
arguments
that
obscenity
had
a
very
broad
reach
in
terms
of
minors
or
portions
of
a
book
condemned
the
(inaudible).
and
what
the
court
did,
it
seems
to
me
was
to
strike
a
balance
and
i
must
say
in
retrospect,
the
balance
was
one
that
although
i
didn’t
agree
with
it
then
as
i
look
back
has
a
logic
to
it.
the
balance
that
was
struck
was
to
try
and
get
at
the
legitimate
interests
of
society
in
this
whole
area
and
there
was
an
enormous
amount
of
protection
given
to
such
material
in
the
roth
case
even
as
the
court
said
that
“obscenity”
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
and
almost
everything
that
this
court
has
done
since
roth
with
a
few
unhappy
exceptions
but
almost
everything
that
has
been
done
since
then
has
been
to,
first
of
all
narrow
the
reach
of
the
obscenity
laws
and
secondly
to
expand
and
of
course
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin
to
expand
the
first
amendment
protection
afforded
to
sex
material.
the
cases
came
down
procedurally.
searches
and
seizures
were
narrowly
cutback
so
that
a
lot
of
material
would
not
be
suppressed
under
roth.
the
(inaudible)
requirement
was
found
necessary
in
smith.
in
case
after
case,
this
court
has
said
that
this
person
or
that
person,
this
organization
or
that
organization,
it
was
not
a
fifth
party
to
determine
what
is
and
what
is
not
obscene
until
finally
in
rowen,
the
court
came
down
and
really
sad,
yes
we’re
entitled
to
have
censorship
and
the
censorship
by
200
million
people.
each
person
is
his
own
censor
and
responsible
to
himself.
and
we
don’t
need
postal
inspectors
or
customs
inspectors
or
district
attorneys
or
police
officers
to
make
this
determination.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
this
court
has
said
even
that
or
suggested,
i
know
that
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
and
the
earliest
case,
the
kingsley
boot
case
that
a
judge
without
a
jury
wasn’t
qualified.
there
was
a
thought
that
we
need
juries
and
yet
we
see
within
many
jury
cases
coming
up
that
the
juries
also
are
not
able
to
make
the
sensitive
judgment.
so
jury
verdicts
have
been
overturned
by
this
court
which
was
necessarily
then
forced
to
act
as
a
super
censor
to
everybody’s
discomfort
and
so
this
court
has
been
attempting
i
submit,
and
properly
to
extricate
itself
from
having
to
sit
as
a
board
of
super
censors.
and
what
has
come
down
out
of
all
this,
it
seems
to
me
is
to
get
away
from
this
business
of
reading
a
book
and
looking
in
a
movie
and
said
yes,
this
is
good
or
this
is
bad.
it’s
futile.
i
think
in
that
sense,
that
the
stanley
opinion
really
synthesizes
all
of
the
legitimate
interest
and
says
a
number
of
things.
first
of
all,
it
says
that
government
simply
has
no
business
telling
people
what
to
read
or
view.
all
of
the
traditional
arguments
are
no
good;
protect
his
morality,
that’s
his
business.
the
government
shouldn’t
be
protecting
the
morality
of
individuals.
anti-social
conduct,
no
proof
of
that
at
all
and
besides,
when
the
conduct
appears,
it’s
time
enough
to
act.
in
short,
the
court
seemed
to
have
said,
now
let’s
get
to
it
and
what
is
it
that
we’re
concerned
with?
we’re
concerned
with
minors,
we
have
said
so
in
the
ginsburg
against
new
york
file,
minors
can
be
protected.
we’re
concerned
with
trusting
it
upon
unwilling
audiences
because
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
for
many
people
to
have
a
strong,
explicit,
sexual
material
thrust
upon
them,
is
very
offensive
not
too
unlike.
perhaps
the
analogy
in
chiplinsky
which
is
thrusting
and
has
some
kind
of
a
physical,
emotional
reaction.
but
beyond
that,
to
say
that
government
has
the
right
to
tell
adults
that
they
ought
to
read
this
because
they
may
become
aroused
sexually
or
because
they
may
have
some
fantasies,
we
know
now,
that
that
was
a
futile
task
which
really
bred
a
great
deal
of
lawlessness
below
because
the
standards
were
always
impossibly
vague
and
there
wasn’t
always
an
enormous
of
hypocrisy.
and
so
it
was
that
after
some
14
years
of
dealing
with
roth
and
with
a
number
of
suggestions
as
to
where
we
were
going.
mr.
justice
brennan
in
jacobella
(ph)
suggested
back
in
1964
that
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
or
in
better,
if
the
states
were
to
pinpoint
their
legislation
at
minors
which
then
seemed
to
be
the
major
concern
of
society.
then
in
the
ginsburg
case,
ralph
ginsburg,
another
legitimate
state
interest,
governmental
emerged
and
that
was
the
business
of
thrusting
it
upon
an
unwilling
audience
and
then
finally
in
the
sam-ginsburg
case,
this
court
said
that
minors
could
have
a
different
standards.
so
that
this
court
before
stanley
had
carved
down,
it
seems
to
me
and
had
suggested
that
most
of
it
in
redrup
had
carved
out
legitimate
state
interest
and
had
said
that
here
the
government
has
a
legitimate
concern
and
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
we
submit
is
that
beyond
that,
there
is
no
legitimate
concern.
and
that
i
believe
is
where
rowen
also
seems
to
have
a
relevance
to
this
because
rowen,
it's
not
mentioned
by
the
government
at
all
here
but
rowen
also
has
the
two
sides.
rowen
says
that
if
a
person
doesn’t
want
something
to
cross
the
threshold
of
his
home
by
mail,
he
can
say
no
to
that
and
he
has
the
broadest
power
in
saying
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
the
court
of
course
held
that
congress
might
permissibly
passage
a
statute
but
the
opinion
said
that
the
right
of
mailer
to
send
into
a
home
ends
at
that
point
where
the
mailer
says
no.
beyond
that,
has
a
right
to
communicate
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
to
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
although,
in
all
fairness,
i
think
the
court
did
kind
of
invent
it
in
ginsburg
which
preceded
the
legislation
that
was
somewhat
comparable.
but
of
course,
it’s
true
that
section
4009
was
then
enacted
by
congress
and
this
court
merely
said
that
that
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
rights.
now,
it’s
within
this
framework,
as
i
say
that
we
come
to
stanley,
the
solicitor
general
says,
he
doesn’t
know
what
provision
of
the
first
amendment
is
applicable.
over
and
over
again,
the
court
said
it
was
the
first
amendment
and
we’re
dealing
with
pure
speech.
we’re
really
dealing
with
pure
speech;
we’re
talking
about
the
right
of
a
person
to
just
read.
it’s
got
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
conduct
cases
in
any
way.
we’re
not
talking
about
anything
that’s
peripheral.
we’re
saying
that
the
court
has
said
that
a
man
has
the
right
to
satisfy
his
curiosity,
to
get
information
from
sexual
material
by
reading
what
is
explicit
as
explicit
as
it
can
be.
so
that,
i
don’t
see
how
the
opinion
really
could’ve
been
any
clearer
that
it
was
bottomed
on
the
first
amendment.
the
entire
argument
about
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas,
the
court
wasn’t
right
talking
abstractly,
i
suppose,
we
were
talking
within
the
framework
of
stanley.
stanley
had
a
film
which
was
explicitly
sexual
and
the
court
said
he
had
the
right
to
possess
it,
he
had
the
right
to
view
it
and
he
had
the
right
to
receive
it.
all
of
that
is
traditional,
clean
first
amendment
arguments.
so
that
the
attempt
of
the
government
now
to
bootleg
in
a
fourth
amendment
argument
is
really
as
has
been
suggested
before
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
solicitor
general
to
make
the
concurring
opinion,
the
majority
opinion.
it
was
before
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
wanted
to
go
off
on
the
search
and
seizure
privacy
aspect.
but
the
court
didn’t.
the
court
went
off
absolutely
on
the
first
amendment.
the
text
which
precedes
footnote
11
of
the
opinion
states,
that
this
case
is
decided
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
then
the
footnote
points
out
the
kind
of
illustration
that
the
solicitor
general
gave
and
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
that
does
not
mean
that
a
person
has
the
right
of
privacy
in
his
home
to
have
such
things
as
sort
of
shotguns
or
dope
or
other
things,
but
he
does
have
the
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
have
books
and
films
because
they
are
protected
expression.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
comment
was
made
earlier
of
the
fact
that
most
of
the
lower
courts
considering
stanley
have
concluded
that
it
has
the
meaning
that
we
attribute
to
it
here.
and
i
believe
there’s
a
good
reason
for
that.
i
believe
truly
that
stanley
as
we
interpret
it,
represents
an
idea
whose
time
has
come.
virtually,
everyone
of
the
thoughts
expressed
in
stanley
has
found
reflection
in
the
lockhart
commission
report
which
was
a
study
as
your
honors
know
of
some
two
years.
for
example,
in
stanley,
it
was
stated
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
reading
or
viewing
of
obscene
material
had
any
anti-social
effect.
that’s
exactly
what
the
commission
concluded.
the
commission
stated,
empirical
investigations
supports
the
opinion
of
a
substantial
majority
of
persons
professionally
engaged
in
the
subject
that
exposure
to
sexually
explicit
materials
has
no
harmful
causal
role.
i
go
on
to
say
that
it
appears
to
be
a
usual
and
harmless
part
of
the
process
of
growing
up
in
our
society
and
a
frequent
and
non-damaging
occurrence
among
adults.
the
commission
report
also
stated
that
this
explicit
material
which
was
thought
to
be
totally
valueless
in
fact
does
have
a
great
deal
of
value
that
many
persons
find
that
they
are
benefited
by
having
exposure
to
this
material,
and
i
suspect
that
this
was
part
of
what
was
meant
in
stanley
when
the
court
said
that
mr.
stanley
had
the
right
to
satisfy
his
emotional
and
his
intellectual
needs
by
viewing
this
motion
picture
film
which
was
plainly
extraordinarily
explicit.
the
commission
also
found
that
a
majority
of
people
in
this
country
believed
that
adults
are
to
be
able
to
read
and
view
this
explicit
material
if
they
so
choose.
the
commission
also
found
that
a
majority
of
the
people
believed
that
minors
ought
not
be
exposed
to
such
material.
the
commission
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
morality
which
has
been
discussed
here.
and
also
came
up
with
the
conclusion
and
with
some
arguments
that
i
think
are
persuasive,
that
historically
and
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
there
simply
is
no
power
in
government
to
try
and
control
the
morality
of
individuals
or
society
by
reason
of
what
goes
into
their
heads
as
opposed
to
the
conduct
of
persons.
the
argument
has
been
made
here
in
the
brief
and
by
the
solicitor
general
that
you
have
to
have
a
stopping
of
this
material
at
the
board
and
because
otherwise
you
don’t
know
how
the
material
will
be
used.
that’s
exactly
the
argument
that
the
state
made
in
the
georgia
case,
georgia
argued
that
if
the
state
was
powerless
to
get
the
material
while
it
was
at
the
home,
then
there
would
be
difficulty
of
law
enforcement
and
this
court
said
that
has
never
been
thought
to
be
a
sufficient
reason
to
interfere
with
the
great
rights
that
we’re
being
asserted
in
stanley
and
those
great
rights
again
were
the
right
to
satisfy
an
intellectual
and
emotional
need
of
the
individual.
now
there
is
a
statute,
an
interesting
provision
which
i
believe
also
supports
the
argument
we
are
making
here.
although
the
government
has
sought
to
use
it
somewhere
differently.
the
provision
i
have
reference
to
is
the
so
called
discretionary
clause.
there
is
in
this
customs
law
a
provision
which
says
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
absolute
discretion
can
permit
the
so
called
“classics”
to
be
brought
into
this
country,
if
they
are
brought
in
for
non-commercial
purposes.
there
is
no
limits
on
the
discretion
that
can
be
exercised.
now,
the
government
argues,
of
course
that
provision
doesn’t
mean
anything
now
because
under
the
opinions
of
this
court,
if
the
obscenity
is
a
classic,
it
has
redeeming
social
value
and
therefore
it’s
protected
so
there’s
no
need
for
the
exception.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
it’s
a
classic,
it
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
would
says
that
classical
obscenity
may
be
brought
in
and
to
say
if
it’s
obscene
for
an
intellectual,
it’s
all
right
but
if
it’s
obscene
for
a
truck
driver,
presumably
it’s
not.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
statute
says
that
secretary
of
the
treasury
may
permit
obscene
classics
to
be
brought
in
for
private
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
does
not.
and
the
way
it’s
been
applied
really
has
been
strictly
on
a
class
basis
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
his
friends
think
its
good,
then
it
can
be
brought
in
but
if
it’s
below
their
intellectual
standards,
then
presumably
it’s
not
a
classic
and
it
may
not
be
brought
in.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
really,
the
way
it’s
been
applied
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
perhaps,
this
was
broad
argument
mr.
chief
justice.
the
argument
has
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
appellee
here
does
not
have
standing
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
because,
as
it
quite
properly
points
out
we
did
stipulate
that
the
material
was
to
be
used
commercially
under
the
limitations
that
we
have
spoken
about.
the
solicitor
general
doesn’t
deny
the
general
rule
that
where
there
is
a
statute
which
affects
first
amendment
rights
that
you
don’t
have
to
show
that
the
particular
conduct
is
covered
by
the
person
who
raises
the
fact,
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutionally
broad
because
of
its
possible
chilling
effects
upon
freedom
of
speech.
but
the
solicitor
general
says,
there’s
an
additional
requirement,
the
statute
must
not
only
be
overbroad
but
it
must
be
vague
and
he
says
this
statute
of
course
is
a
model
of
clarity
and
there
is
no
vagueness
in
this
customs
law.
now,
i
submit
that
if
we
do
have
to
have
both
over
breadth
and
vagueness,
we
have
over
breadth
and
we
do
have
vagueness.
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
is
more
vague
than
the
obscenity
statute,
plus
the
fact
that
the
lying
that
the
government
suggest
is
a
lying
between
commercial
and
non-commercial
without
any
attempts
to
refine
how
that
might
be
applied.
for
example,
there
are
cases
which
say
that
it’s
really
not
commercial
as
a
person
just
charges
what
it
costs
him
for
example,
one
would
look
at
that
as
possibly
commercial
or
possibly
not
commercial.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
obscenity
--
this
customs
obscenity
law
is
vague
as
well
as
being
overbroad
and
that
the
appellee
does
in
fact
have
the
standing
to
challenge
it
and
that
the
court
was
quite
the
court
below
was
quite
proper
in
stating
that
if
there
was
any
way
that
the
statute
could
be
applied
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
then
it
should
be
stricken
down.
i
hasten
to
add
that
we
also
contended
below
and
we
contend
here
that
the
court
below
should
have
reached
the
other
view,
also
that
it
was
not
only
unconstitutional
for
the
reason
given
that
it
would
interfere
with
the
right
of
consenting
adults
to
import
obscene
material
but
it
was
also
unconstitutional,
we
contend
because
it
interfered
with
the
specific
conduct
that
appellee
was
talking
about.
that
is
to
say
to
put
the
pictures
into
a
hard-covered
book
for
distribution
to
consenting
adults
only.
that
we
believe
is
the
correct
construction
that
the
limitations
rather
that
congress
has
and
that
the
any
statute
that
went
beyond
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
so
that,
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
below
was
plainly
right
on
the
ground
that
it
decided
the
case
and
that
it
was
also
in
order
to
go
beyond
that.
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
only
say
that
on
the
point
of
procedure,
the
freedman
versus
maryland,
the
vice
that
this
court
found
in
the
mailbox
case
with
regard
to
time
is
equally
applicable
in
this
case.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
when
mr.
luros
was
returning
from
europe.
he
had
in
his
luggage
the
37
photographs
involved
in
this
case.
he
also
had
the
two
odd
books,
one,
a
rollingsons
and
one
of
peter
fendi
and
he
also
had
a
girlie
magazine.
the
customs’
inspector
made
his
snap
judgment
and
found
all
of
these
items
to
be
obscene.
after
we
intervened
in
the
case
as
the
government
did
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
did
return
everything
except
the
37
photographs.
it
was
stipulated
that
the
photographs
were
intended
to
be
used
in
the
kama
sutra;
a
book
which
the
customs
used
to
think
was
obscene
but
no
longer
believes
to
be
obscene.
we
call
to
the
attention
of
customs
at
the
time
by
letter
that
the
use
of
the
book
would
be
private
in
the
sense
that
it
was
to
be
distributed
only
to
consenting
adults
under
such
circumstances
that
it
would
not
offend
the
general
public.
this
was
not
to
be
distributed
broadside.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
it
can
be
accomplished
by
inviting
people
who
are
interested
in
buying
an
illustrated
kama
sutra
to
write
in
and
say
that
they
would
like
to
purchase
such
a
book
and
to
have
adequate
safeguards
that
the
person
is
an
adult.
under
those
circumstances,
it’s
a
private
person
who
privately
elects
to
read
a
book
illustrated.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
an
adult
that
it
defers.
of
course
that’s
not
in
occasional
although
it
was
in
the
case,
it’s
all
let
into
the
customs
and
now
pleaded.
our
pleading
is
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
your
honor,
one
can
protect
it
in
a
lot
of
ways.
i
have
clients
who
require
adults
to
send
in
a
statement
with
some
kind
of
proof
as
to
their
age.
some
clients
require,
for
example,
that
they
send
in
a
copy
of
their
driver’s
license.
so
that
there
are
ways
where
you
can
assure
yourself
that
it
will
in
fact
be
to
consenting
adults
only.
the
point
that
i’m
making
is
that
this
case
really
is
a
privacy
case
in
the
same
sense
if
we
will,
that
it
was
privacy
in
mr.
stanley’s
situation.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
page
19,
your
honor
there
is
a
copy
of
my
letter
and
it
states
that
it
was
to
be
distributed
in
the
fashion
that
i
have
indicated.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
material
is
not
being
imported
for
distribution
to
minors
nor
to
be
trusted
upon
unwilling
dealers
and
it
is
spelled
out
a
little
bit
more
fully
in
our
answer
to
the
complaint
and
our
cross
complaint
which
also
sets
forth
the
intention.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
the
letter
was
part
of
the
stipulation.
yes
that
was
attached
to
the
stipulation
your
honor.
that
is
exhibit
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
this
is
appendix
c,
your
honor
to
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
said
that
i
wrote
this
letter
and
that
this
was
the
content.
so
as
we
come
knowing
in
this
case,
it’s
stipulated
that
customs
was
told
that
this
was
the
intended
purpose
of
the
distribution.
now,
the
case
your
honor
is
not
the
case
as
set
forth
in
the
government’s
brief
of
the
power
to
regulate
customs
and
foreign
trade.
we
conceive
that
of
course,
government
does
have
a
broad
power
to
exclude
materials
all
we
say
is
that
government
in
this
area
is
an
all
area
as
circumscribed
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that
it
may
not
pass
a
shotgun
law
such
as
the
customs
law
here
which
prohibits
an
adult
from
bringing
in
which
satisfies
his;
the
emotional
needs
will
satisfy
some
informational
needs
that
he
may
have
nor
does
it
permit
that
we
submit
the
government
to
keep
such
material
from
circulating
under
the
controlled
circumstances
that
we
have
here.
the
government’s
argument
really
comes
down
to
this.
the
government
states
that,
“roth
held
in
the
first
instance
that
obscenity
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
then
as
if
nothing
else
has
happened
since
roth,
as
if
there
hadn’t
been
really
dozens
and
dozens
of
cases
with
refinements
and
nuances
and
cutbacks,
as
if
nothing
had
happened
since
roth,
they
mechanically
argued
that
obscenity
is
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
can
be
handled
exactly
as
any
other
merchandise.
that
is
the
burden
of
the
government’s
argument.
the
solicitor
general
here
interestingly
calls
to
our
attention
the
biddle
case
which
seems
to
me
to
show
what
is
obvious
that
a
book
or
other
matter
of
communication
cannot
be
treated
and
never
has
been
treated
by
this
court,
the
same
as
shotguns
or
gambling
devices
or
the
like.
i’d
like
to
spend,
if
i
may
a
moment
in
terms
of
roth
and
what
has
happened
since
roth
because
i
think
that
we
cannot
fairly
evaluate
stanley
without
such
a
background
and
i
agree
completely
with
the
solicitor
general
that
stanley
is
a
very
important
case
and
a
case
which
will
be
looked
at
for
many
years
to
come.
as
i
stated,
in
1957
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
important
as
an
important
obscenity
case.
i
think
that
stanley
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i
believe
he
was
suggesting
that
it
was
an
important
case
and
that
it
would
be
debated
for
a
long
period
of
time.
i
think
it
will
be
discussed
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
i
think
that
just
as
the
lower
courts
have
embraced
it
as
holding
essentially
that
adults,
consenting
adults
have
the
right
to
read
what
they
want
to
that
it
will
be
important
for
that
reason
too.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
oh,
i
would
not
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
was,
your
honor.
but
i
would
submit
in
all
deference
mr.
justice
marshall
that
just
as
a
bachelor
can
get
some
information
and
can
satisfy
some
of
his
emotional
needs
by
viewing
such
a
film,
a
married
person
may
also
get
it.
i
suspect
that
stanley
is
not
limited
to
bachelor’s
reading
or
viewing
of
such
material.
the
government
in
burn
initially
stated
that
it
was
not
only
in
the
privacy
of
one’s
home
but
also
in
an
office.
that’s
what
burn
says.
when
the
government
wrote
burn,
they
said
it
was
the
privacy
of
a
home
and
office.
well,
i
would
suspect
that
a
person
could
take
a
book
and
go
to
the
park
and
get
whatever
information
or
emotional
satisfaction
there
just
as
well.
the
crucial
point
as
i
read
and
read
stanley
is
that
government
does
have
legitimate
interests
and
those
will
be
protected
completely
but
that
those
legitimate
interests
are
narrow.
one
of
the
legitimate
interest
is
not
ever
to
tell
adults
what
they
should
read
or
what
they
should
see
and
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
they
see
it
in
a
private
boot
walk,
they
see
it
in
a
friend’s
home.
if
they
see
it
in
their
office,
the
important
thing
is,
that
it’s
not
thrust
upon
an
un-willing
audience
and
that
we
have
adequate
of
protection
to
see
that
the
material
is
not
distributed
to
minors.
and
those
are
we
submit,
the
synthesis
of
all
that
has
happened
since
roth.
now
at
the
time
of
roth,
the
court
was
faced
really
with
choices
as
the
court
has
always
faced.
there
were
three
arguments
that
were
being
put
forward.
i
was
here
then
and
i
was
making
an
absolutist
argument.
i
was
saying
that
obscenity
was
absolutely
protected.
there
was,
and
before
the
house,
the
whole
(inaudible)
arguments
that
obscenity
had
a
very
broad
reach
in
terms
of
minors
or
portions
of
a
book
condemned
the
(inaudible).
and
what
the
court
did,
it
seems
to
me
was
to
strike
a
balance
and
i
must
say
in
retrospect,
the
balance
was
one
that
although
i
didn’t
agree
with
it
then
as
i
look
back
has
a
logic
to
it.
the
balance
that
was
struck
was
to
try
and
get
at
the
legitimate
interests
of
society
in
this
whole
area
and
there
was
an
enormous
amount
of
protection
given
to
such
material
in
the
roth
case
even
as
the
court
said
that
“obscenity”
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
and
almost
everything
that
this
court
has
done
since
roth
with
a
few
unhappy
exceptions
but
almost
everything
that
has
been
done
since
then
has
been
to,
first
of
all
narrow
the
reach
of
the
obscenity
laws
and
secondly
to
expand
and
of
course
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin
to
expand
the
first
amendment
protection
afforded
to
sex
material.
the
cases
came
down
procedurally.
searches
and
seizures
were
narrowly
cutback
so
that
a
lot
of
material
would
not
be
suppressed
under
roth.
the
(inaudible)
requirement
was
found
necessary
in
smith.
in
case
after
case,
this
court
has
said
that
this
person
or
that
person,
this
organization
or
that
organization,
it
was
not
a
fifth
party
to
determine
what
is
and
what
is
not
obscene
until
finally
in
rowen,
the
court
came
down
and
really
sad,
yes
we’re
entitled
to
have
censorship
and
the
censorship
by
200
million
people.
each
person
is
his
own
censor
and
responsible
to
himself.
and
we
don’t
need
postal
inspectors
or
customs
inspectors
or
district
attorneys
or
police
officers
to
make
this
determination.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
this
court
has
said
even
that
or
suggested,
i
know
that
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
and
the
earliest
case,
the
kingsley
boot
case
that
a
judge
without
a
jury
wasn’t
qualified.
there
was
a
thought
that
we
need
juries
and
yet
we
see
within
many
jury
cases
coming
up
that
the
juries
also
are
not
able
to
make
the
sensitive
judgment.
so
jury
verdicts
have
been
overturned
by
this
court
which
was
necessarily
then
forced
to
act
as
a
super
censor
to
everybody’s
discomfort
and
so
this
court
has
been
attempting
i
submit,
and
properly
to
extricate
itself
from
having
to
sit
as
a
board
of
super
censors.
and
what
has
come
down
out
of
all
this,
it
seems
to
me
is
to
get
away
from
this
business
of
reading
a
book
and
looking
in
a
movie
and
said
yes,
this
is
good
or
this
is
bad.
it’s
futile.
i
think
in
that
sense,
that
the
stanley
opinion
really
synthesizes
all
of
the
legitimate
interest
and
says
a
number
of
things.
first
of
all,
it
says
that
government
simply
has
no
business
telling
people
what
to
read
or
view.
all
of
the
traditional
arguments
are
no
good;
protect
his
morality,
that’s
his
business.
the
government
shouldn’t
be
protecting
the
morality
of
individuals.
anti-social
conduct,
no
proof
of
that
at
all
and
besides,
when
the
conduct
appears,
it’s
time
enough
to
act.
in
short,
the
court
seemed
to
have
said,
now
let’s
get
to
it
and
what
is
it
that
we’re
concerned
with?
we’re
concerned
with
minors,
we
have
said
so
in
the
ginsburg
against
new
york
file,
minors
can
be
protected.
we’re
concerned
with
trusting
it
upon
unwilling
audiences
because
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
for
many
people
to
have
a
strong,
explicit,
sexual
material
thrust
upon
them,
is
very
offensive
not
too
unlike.
perhaps
the
analogy
in
chiplinsky
which
is
thrusting
and
has
some
kind
of
a
physical,
emotional
reaction.
but
beyond
that,
to
say
that
government
has
the
right
to
tell
adults
that
they
ought
to
read
this
because
they
may
become
aroused
sexually
or
because
they
may
have
some
fantasies,
we
know
now,
that
that
was
a
futile
task
which
really
bred
a
great
deal
of
lawlessness
below
because
the
standards
were
always
impossibly
vague
and
there
wasn’t
always
an
enormous
of
hypocrisy.
and
so
it
was
that
after
some
14
years
of
dealing
with
roth
and
with
a
number
of
suggestions
as
to
where
we
were
going.
mr.
justice
brennan
in
jacobella
(ph)
suggested
back
in
1964
that
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
or
in
better,
if
the
states
were
to
pinpoint
their
legislation
at
minors
which
then
seemed
to
be
the
major
concern
of
society.
then
in
the
ginsburg
case,
ralph
ginsburg,
another
legitimate
state
interest,
governmental
emerged
and
that
was
the
business
of
thrusting
it
upon
an
unwilling
audience
and
then
finally
in
the
sam-ginsburg
case,
this
court
said
that
minors
could
have
a
different
standards.
so
that
this
court
before
stanley
had
carved
down,
it
seems
to
me
and
had
suggested
that
most
of
it
in
redrup
had
carved
out
legitimate
state
interest
and
had
said
that
here
the
government
has
a
legitimate
concern
and
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
we
submit
is
that
beyond
that,
there
is
no
legitimate
concern.
and
that
i
believe
is
where
rowen
also
seems
to
have
a
relevance
to
this
because
rowen,
it's
not
mentioned
by
the
government
at
all
here
but
rowen
also
has
the
two
sides.
rowen
says
that
if
a
person
doesn’t
want
something
to
cross
the
threshold
of
his
home
by
mail,
he
can
say
no
to
that
and
he
has
the
broadest
power
in
saying
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
the
court
of
course
held
that
congress
might
permissibly
passage
a
statute
but
the
opinion
said
that
the
right
of
mailer
to
send
into
a
home
ends
at
that
point
where
the
mailer
says
no.
beyond
that,
has
a
right
to
communicate
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
to
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
although,
in
all
fairness,
i
think
the
court
did
kind
of
invent
it
in
ginsburg
which
preceded
the
legislation
that
was
somewhat
comparable.
but
of
course,
it’s
true
that
section
4009
was
then
enacted
by
congress
and
this
court
merely
said
that
that
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
rights.
now,
it’s
within
this
framework,
as
i
say
that
we
come
to
stanley,
the
solicitor
general
says,
he
doesn’t
know
what
provision
of
the
first
amendment
is
applicable.
over
and
over
again,
the
court
said
it
was
the
first
amendment
and
we’re
dealing
with
pure
speech.
we’re
really
dealing
with
pure
speech;
we’re
talking
about
the
right
of
a
person
to
just
read.
it’s
got
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
conduct
cases
in
any
way.
we’re
not
talking
about
anything
that’s
peripheral.
we’re
saying
that
the
court
has
said
that
a
man
has
the
right
to
satisfy
his
curiosity,
to
get
information
from
sexual
material
by
reading
what
is
explicit
as
explicit
as
it
can
be.
so
that,
i
don’t
see
how
the
opinion
really
could’ve
been
any
clearer
that
it
was
bottomed
on
the
first
amendment.
the
entire
argument
about
the
right
to
receive
information
and
ideas,
the
court
wasn’t
right
talking
abstractly,
i
suppose,
we
were
talking
within
the
framework
of
stanley.
stanley
had
a
film
which
was
explicitly
sexual
and
the
court
said
he
had
the
right
to
possess
it,
he
had
the
right
to
view
it
and
he
had
the
right
to
receive
it.
all
of
that
is
traditional,
clean
first
amendment
arguments.
so
that
the
attempt
of
the
government
now
to
bootleg
in
a
fourth
amendment
argument
is
really
as
has
been
suggested
before
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
solicitor
general
to
make
the
concurring
opinion,
the
majority
opinion.
it
was
before
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
wanted
to
go
off
on
the
search
and
seizure
privacy
aspect.
but
the
court
didn’t.
the
court
went
off
absolutely
on
the
first
amendment.
the
text
which
precedes
footnote
11
of
the
opinion
states,
that
this
case
is
decided
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
then
the
footnote
points
out
the
kind
of
illustration
that
the
solicitor
general
gave
and
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
that
does
not
mean
that
a
person
has
the
right
of
privacy
in
his
home
to
have
such
things
as
sort
of
shotguns
or
dope
or
other
things,
but
he
does
have
the
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
have
books
and
films
because
they
are
protected
expression.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
comment
was
made
earlier
of
the
fact
that
most
of
the
lower
courts
considering
stanley
have
concluded
that
it
has
the
meaning
that
we
attribute
to
it
here.
and
i
believe
there’s
a
good
reason
for
that.
i
believe
truly
that
stanley
as
we
interpret
it,
represents
an
idea
whose
time
has
come.
virtually,
everyone
of
the
thoughts
expressed
in
stanley
has
found
reflection
in
the
lockhart
commission
report
which
was
a
study
as
your
honors
know
of
some
two
years.
for
example,
in
stanley,
it
was
stated
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
reading
or
viewing
of
obscene
material
had
any
anti-social
effect.
that’s
exactly
what
the
commission
concluded.
the
commission
stated,
empirical
investigations
supports
the
opinion
of
a
substantial
majority
of
persons
professionally
engaged
in
the
subject
that
exposure
to
sexually
explicit
materials
has
no
harmful
causal
role.
i
go
on
to
say
that
it
appears
to
be
a
usual
and
harmless
part
of
the
process
of
growing
up
in
our
society
and
a
frequent
and
non-damaging
occurrence
among
adults.
the
commission
report
also
stated
that
this
explicit
material
which
was
thought
to
be
totally
valueless
in
fact
does
have
a
great
deal
of
value
that
many
persons
find
that
they
are
benefited
by
having
exposure
to
this
material,
and
i
suspect
that
this
was
part
of
what
was
meant
in
stanley
when
the
court
said
that
mr.
stanley
had
the
right
to
satisfy
his
emotional
and
his
intellectual
needs
by
viewing
this
motion
picture
film
which
was
plainly
extraordinarily
explicit.
the
commission
also
found
that
a
majority
of
people
in
this
country
believed
that
adults
are
to
be
able
to
read
and
view
this
explicit
material
if
they
so
choose.
the
commission
also
found
that
a
majority
of
the
people
believed
that
minors
ought
not
be
exposed
to
such
material.
the
commission
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
morality
which
has
been
discussed
here.
and
also
came
up
with
the
conclusion
and
with
some
arguments
that
i
think
are
persuasive,
that
historically
and
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
there
simply
is
no
power
in
government
to
try
and
control
the
morality
of
individuals
or
society
by
reason
of
what
goes
into
their
heads
as
opposed
to
the
conduct
of
persons.
the
argument
has
been
made
here
in
the
brief
and
by
the
solicitor
general
that
you
have
to
have
a
stopping
of
this
material
at
the
board
and
because
otherwise
you
don’t
know
how
the
material
will
be
used.
that’s
exactly
the
argument
that
the
state
made
in
the
georgia
case,
georgia
argued
that
if
the
state
was
powerless
to
get
the
material
while
it
was
at
the
home,
then
there
would
be
difficulty
of
law
enforcement
and
this
court
said
that
has
never
been
thought
to
be
a
sufficient
reason
to
interfere
with
the
great
rights
that
we’re
being
asserted
in
stanley
and
those
great
rights
again
were
the
right
to
satisfy
an
intellectual
and
emotional
need
of
the
individual.
now
there
is
a
statute,
an
interesting
provision
which
i
believe
also
supports
the
argument
we
are
making
here.
although
the
government
has
sought
to
use
it
somewhere
differently.
the
provision
i
have
reference
to
is
the
so
called
discretionary
clause.
there
is
in
this
customs
law
a
provision
which
says
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
absolute
discretion
can
permit
the
so
called
“classics”
to
be
brought
into
this
country,
if
they
are
brought
in
for
non-commercial
purposes.
there
is
no
limits
on
the
discretion
that
can
be
exercised.
now,
the
government
argues,
of
course
that
provision
doesn’t
mean
anything
now
because
under
the
opinions
of
this
court,
if
the
obscenity
is
a
classic,
it
has
redeeming
social
value
and
therefore
it’s
protected
so
there’s
no
need
for
the
exception.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
it’s
a
classic,
it
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
would
says
that
classical
obscenity
may
be
brought
in
and
to
say
if
it’s
obscene
for
an
intellectual,
it’s
all
right
but
if
it’s
obscene
for
a
truck
driver,
presumably
it’s
not.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
statute
says
that
secretary
of
the
treasury
may
permit
obscene
classics
to
be
brought
in
for
private
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
does
not.
and
the
way
it’s
been
applied
really
has
been
strictly
on
a
class
basis
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
his
friends
think
its
good,
then
it
can
be
brought
in
but
if
it’s
below
their
intellectual
standards,
then
presumably
it’s
not
a
classic
and
it
may
not
be
brought
in.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
really,
the
way
it’s
been
applied
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
perhaps,
this
was
broad
argument
mr.
chief
justice.
the
argument
has
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
appellee
here
does
not
have
standing
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
because,
as
it
quite
properly
points
out
we
did
stipulate
that
the
material
was
to
be
used
commercially
under
the
limitations
that
we
have
spoken
about.
the
solicitor
general
doesn’t
deny
the
general
rule
that
where
there
is
a
statute
which
affects
first
amendment
rights
that
you
don’t
have
to
show
that
the
particular
conduct
is
covered
by
the
person
who
raises
the
fact,
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutionally
broad
because
of
its
possible
chilling
effects
upon
freedom
of
speech.
but
the
solicitor
general
says,
there’s
an
additional
requirement,
the
statute
must
not
only
be
overbroad
but
it
must
be
vague
and
he
says
this
statute
of
course
is
a
model
of
clarity
and
there
is
no
vagueness
in
this
customs
law.
now,
i
submit
that
if
we
do
have
to
have
both
over
breadth
and
vagueness,
we
have
over
breadth
and
we
do
have
vagueness.
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
is
more
vague
than
the
obscenity
statute,
plus
the
fact
that
the
lying
that
the
government
suggest
is
a
lying
between
commercial
and
non-commercial
without
any
attempts
to
refine
how
that
might
be
applied.
for
example,
there
are
cases
which
say
that
it’s
really
not
commercial
as
a
person
just
charges
what
it
costs
him
for
example,
one
would
look
at
that
as
possibly
commercial
or
possibly
not
commercial.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
obscenity
--
this
customs
obscenity
law
is
vague
as
well
as
being
overbroad
and
that
the
appellee
does
in
fact
have
the
standing
to
challenge
it
and
that
the
court
was
quite
the
court
below
was
quite
proper
in
stating
that
if
there
was
any
way
that
the
statute
could
be
applied
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
then
it
should
be
stricken
down.
i
hasten
to
add
that
we
also
contended
below
and
we
contend
here
that
the
court
below
should
have
reached
the
other
view,
also
that
it
was
not
only
unconstitutional
for
the
reason
given
that
it
would
interfere
with
the
right
of
consenting
adults
to
import
obscene
material
but
it
was
also
unconstitutional,
we
contend
because
it
interfered
with
the
specific
conduct
that
appellee
was
talking
about.
that
is
to
say
to
put
the
pictures
into
a
hard-covered
book
for
distribution
to
consenting
adults
only.
that
we
believe
is
the
correct
construction
that
the
limitations
rather
that
congress
has
and
that
the
any
statute
that
went
beyond
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
so
that,
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
below
was
plainly
right
on
the
ground
that
it
decided
the
case
and
that
it
was
also
in
order
to
go
beyond
that.
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
only
say
that
on
the
point
of
procedure,
the
freedman
versus
maryland,
the
vice
that
this
court
found
in
the
mailbox
case
with
regard
to
time
is
equally
applicable
in
this
case.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
