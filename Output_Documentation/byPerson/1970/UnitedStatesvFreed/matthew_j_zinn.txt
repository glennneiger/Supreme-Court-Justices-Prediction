mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government’s
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
dismissing
a
two-count
indictment
against
the
appellees,
the
first
for
conspiracy
to
possess
and
the
second
for
the
completed
substantive
act
of
possession
of
unregistered
hand
grenades
in
violation
of
26
u.s.c.
section
5861
(d).
that
provision
which
appears
on
page
4
of
our
brief
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
“to
receive
or
possess
a
firearm
which
is
not
registered
to
him
in
the
national
firearms
registration
and
transfer
record.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
only
hand
grenades.
and
i
guess
i
ought
to
point
out
now
although
i
was
going
to
do
so
later
that
the
provisions
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
do
not
apply
to
all
firearms,
but
generally
to
sawed-off
rifles
and
shotguns,
short-barrel
rifles
and
shotguns,
silencers,
machineguns,
other
automatic
weapons
and
destructive
devices
such
as
bombs,
rockets
and
hand
grenades.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
on
two
constitutional
grounds.
first,
it
ruled
that
section
5841
(c)
which
requires
that
certain
information
be
furnished
the
government
before
a
firearm
is
registered
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
before
a
firearm
is
transferred
and
section
5861
(d)
are
unconstitutional
because
section
5841
(c)
requires
appellees
to
furnish
evidence
incriminating
to
themselves
under
california
law
making
it
unlawful
to
possess
hand
grenades.
second,
the
district
court
rule
that
section
5861
(b)
violates
the
due
process
clause
because
it
does
not
require
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
that
a
transferee
obtained
possession
of
a
firearm
with
specific
knowledge
and
intent
that
the
firearm
be
unregistered.
section
5861
(d)
and
section
5841
(c)
were
enacted
as
part
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968.
that
act
was
passed
by
congress
in
response
to
the
violence
occurring
earlier
in
1968
and
to
the
fact
that
during
1967
more
than
130,000
people
in
the
united
states
were
victimized
by
gunman.
title
ii
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
would
which
is
concerned
here
substantially
amended
the
national
firearms
act
which
this
court
had
dealt
with
in
haynes
against
the
united
states
which
was
decided
in
january
of
1968
together
with
marchetti
and
grosso.
in
haynes,
this
court
concluded
that
the
old
registration
and
possession
provisions
of
the
national
firearms
act
compelled
self-incrimination
and
that
the
privilege
was
a
complete
defense
to
a
prosecution
under
either
the
possession
or
registration
provisions.
in
amending
the
national
firearms
act
in
october
of
1968,
congress
set
out
to
cure
the
constitutional
infirmities
which
were
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
opinion
as
existing
under
the
prior
statutory
scheme.
the
pertinent
legislative
history
is
replete
with
congressional
references
to
its
purpose
to
overcome
the
prior
infirmities
and
in
this
respect
the
congress
was
doing
just
what
mr.
justice
harlan
invited
it
to
do
in
his
opinion
in
haynes.
he
explained
that
a
valid
statute
could
be
enacted
which
would
achieve
substantially
the
same
purposes
as
the
statutory
scheme
dealt
with
by
the
court
in
haynes
and
which
would
not
run
a
foul
of
constitutional
limitations.
our
position
here
is
that
congress
has
done
just
this
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
it
is.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
at
the
outset
for
me
to
describe
briefly
how
the
new
national
firearms
act
works
in
actual
practice.
to
illustrate
the
provisions
of
the
new
act,
let
us
assume
that
a
manufacturer
who
is
license
to
manufacture
hand
grenades
in
fact
does
so.
he
is
required
to
register
the
hand
grenades
with
the
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
division
of
the
internal
revenue
service
that's
the
atfd
by
giving
notice
of
their
manufacture
and
of
the
serial
number
of
each
grenade.
this
is
required
by
section
5841
(d)
and
(c)
which
is
set
out
on
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief.
upon
giving
the
notice
to
the
atfd,
the
hand
grenades
are
then
registered
to
the
manufacturer.
if
he
wishes
to
transfer
them
to
another,
he
may
do
so
lawfully
and
the
transferee
may
receive
them
lawfully
only
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
5812
of
title
26
which
appears
on
page
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
under
section
5812,
a
grenade
may
not
be
transferred
unless
the
transferor
has
filed
the
requisite
application
in
duplicate
with
atfd
and
has
paid
the
transfer
tax
which
is
$200.00
in
the
case
of
grenade.
the
transferor,
the
transferee
and
the
firearm
to
be
transferred
must
be
identified
in
the
application.
in
addition,
they
must
be
appended
to
the
application
--
a
set
of
fingerprints
of
the
transferee,
his
photograph
and
a
statement
from
the
local
chief
of
police
or
other
similar
official
that
receive
or
possession
of
the
firearm
would
not
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
state
or
local
law.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
law
enforce
--
i
am
advised
that
there
are
collectors
mr.
justice
harlan,
people
who
like
to
have
more
trophies
and
much
to
my
own
surprise
some
people
just
like
to
have
rockets
--
live
rockets
or
live
bombs
in
their
basements
and
so
long
as
it’s
not
prohibited
by
state
law,
it’s
possible
to
do
that.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
don’t
really
know
what
they
do
with
them
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
more
than
180,000
firearms
described
in
title
ii
are
registered.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don’t
know
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
bombs
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right
plus
i
assume
the
cost
of
acquiring
the
firearm.
now,
admittedly
mr.
justice
most
of
the
firearms
registered
are
registered
to
law
enforcement
officials
but
there
are
substantial
numbers
in
museums
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
don’t
have
to
pay
the
tax,
but
except
in
the
case
of
a
firearm
in
the
possession
or
under
the
control
of
united
states.
the
application
must
be
filed
and
notice
must
be
given
that
is
being
transferred
to
a
local
official.
the
fact
remains
if
there
are
actually
people
who
enjoy
having
these
things.
as
i
have
said
that
in
addition
to
the
transferor’s
application,
there
is
appended
the
set
of
the
fingerprints
of
the
transferee,
his
photograph
and
a
statement
from
the
local
chief
of
police
that
receipt
or
possession
of
the
firearm
would
not
the
transferee
in
violation
of
local
law.
now,
this
package
is
sent
to
the
atfd
right
here
in
washington,
that
body
is
empowered
to
approve
an
application
only
if
and
this
is
critical
to
our
case
receipt
or
possession
of
the
firearm
would
not
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
state
local
or
federal
law.
if
atfd
rejects
an
application,
it
returns
the
original
application
and
gives
the
reasons
for
its
action.
if
it
approves
it
so
indicates
on
the
original
and
returns
it
to
the
transferor,
it
places
the
duplicate
in
the
national
firearms
transfer
and
registration
record.
only
after
the
transferor
has
received
the
approved
application,
is
he
permitted
to
transfer
the
firearm
to
the
transferee.
only
then
is
the
transferee
permitted
to
take
possession
of
the
firearm
and
only
then
when
he
takes
possession
together
with
the
approved
application
which
the
transferor
delivers
to
him
with
the
weapon.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
which
violate
local
or
federal
law
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right
similar
to
what
you
suggested
in
minor
and
buie.
i
should
like
before
turning
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
if
i
may
to
set
out
in
some
detail,
our
understanding
of
the
old
national
firearms
act
which
this
court
found
in
haynes.
the
old
section
5841
imposed
on
anyone
possessing
a
firearm,
the
duty
to
register
that
firearm
unless
it
had
been
made
or
transferred
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
old
act.
but
if
a
person
possessing
a
firearm
required
to
be
registered
came
forward
to
register
under
the
old
act,
he
necessarily
incriminated
himself
for
possession
of
a
firearm
that
had
been
made
or
transferred
in
violation
of
the
act
which
was
proscribed
by
the
old
section
5851.
in
short,
a
person
was
required
to
come
forward
to
comply
with
one
provision
of
the
statutory
scheme,
but
if
the
risk
of
incriminating
himself
under
another
provision
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
subsequently
in
the
minor
and
buie
case
last
term
the
vice
of
the
old
national
firearms
act
was
the
same
vice
that
this
court
found
existed
with
respect
to
the
occupational
and
excise
taxes
on
gamblers
in
the
marchetti
and
grosso
cases.
in
those
cases,
a
person
was
required
to
come
forward
and
reveal
information
as
to
his
gambling
activities
to
federal
authorities
even
though
disclosure
of
those
activities
could
be
made
to
other
federal
authorities
and
to
state
authorities
and
even
though
such
activities
were
proscribed
by
both
state
and
federal
law.
moreover,
mr.
justice
harlan
found
in
haynes
that
under
the
old
statute,
the
only
persons
required
to
register
were
those
unlawfully
in
possession
of
firearms.
the
registration
requirements
thus
applied
only
to
those
inherently
suspect
of
criminality
as
did
the
requirement
held
impermissible
in
the
albertson
case.
in
the
new
national
firearms
act,
congress
has
eliminated
any
possibility
of
self-incrimination
of
a
transferee
of
a
firearm
whereas
the
old
statute
required
registration
only
by
those
unlawfully
in
possession
of
firearms.
the
new
statute
requires
registration
by
all
possesses
of
firearms
with
the
single
exception
of
the
united
states.
appellees
do
not
dispute
this.
second,
under
the
new
statute,
the
only
persons
permitted
to
accept
possession
of
firearms
are
those
whose
possession
would
not
place
them
in
violation
of
law.
in
so
far
as
relevant
here,
this
limitation
is
spelled
out
in
the
last
sentence
of
section
5812
(a)
which
appears
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
thus,
unlike
the
situation
in
haynes
not
only
does
a
person
unlawfully
in
possession
not
have
a
duty
to
come
forward
and
admit
his
unlawful
possession,
but
he
cannot
register
firearm.
a
person
is
not
compelled
as
he
was
in
haynes
to
come
forward
under
one
provision
only
to
be
incriminating
himself
under
another.
completion
of
the
substantive
crime
under
the
new
act
occurs
when
a
person
accepts
possession
before
the
atfd
has
approved
the
transfer
to
him.
after
that,
there
is
no
duty
imposed
upon
the
unlawful
transferee
as
there
was
in
haynes
and
if
he
is
convicted
of
unlawful
possession
it
is
not
because
of
any
information
he
furnished
but
simply
because
of
his
unlawful
possession.
the
appellees’
position
here
is
not
that
they
are
whipsawed
between
one
provision
of
the
federal
statute
and
another
as
was
the
petitioner
in
haynes.
they
make
no
such
contention,
they
allege
only
that
the
self-incrimination
has
it
for
them
arises
because
california
law
prohibits
them
from
possessing
hand
grenades.
but
since
the
statute
provides
that
atfd
may
approve
a
transfer
only
if
it
is
lawful
under
california
law.
appellees
would
not
self-incrimination
under
that
law
by
complying
with
the
federal
requirements.
the
possession
by
appellees
would
be
unlawful
under
california
law,
the
application
to
transfer
would
be
denied
by
atfd.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
that
atfd
would
make
a
judgment
as
to
its
opinion
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
has
codified
or
i
should
say
collected
all
the
local
laws
and
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
real
dispute
however
about
california
law
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
in
substance
it
was
mr.
justice.
there
is
a
very
short
record
appendix
and
i
think
that
you
will
see
that
the
essence
of
the
arguments
was
made
if
not
in
the
full
detail
which
we
are
making
them
here
and
it
would
--
we
made
in
our
brief.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
appellees
are
in
the
same
position
as
what
the
seller
of
narcotics
in
the
minor
case
which
was
decided
last
term.
if
that
person
would
be
an
unlawful
transferee,
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
approach
someone
who
is
lawfully
in
possession
in
order
to
obtain
a
firearm.
it
is
for
more
likely
that
he
would
approach
it
would
transferor
who
is
unlawfully
in
possession.
and
if
the
transferor
is
unlawfully
in
possession,
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
transfer
the
firearm
to
the
transferee
under
the
provisions
of
the
new
national
firearms
act.
the
act
provides
that
weapons
may
be
transferred
only
by
those
lawfully
in
possession.
in
the
unusual
case
where
he
does
approach
a
lawful
transferee
it
seems
to
us
unlikely
that
such
a
transferee
would
file
an
application
for
transfer
knowing
that
it
would
be
rejected
because
the
possession
of
the
firearm
would
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
local
law.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
the
statute
was
passed
or
enacted
into
law
on
october
22,
1968.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
they
were
in
the
records
of
the
atfd
before
the
new
act
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
never
registered.
the
act
set
a
30-day
amnesty
period,
beginning
on
november
1
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
that’s
not
this
case
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
don’t
think
it
--
well,
it
is
a
different
case
but
our
position
is
that
even
that
situation
would
not
run
afoul
of
constitutional
limitations.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
used
limitation,
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
will
in
just
one
moment.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
even
in
a
case
where
the
would
be
transferee
approaches
a
lawful
transferor
and
the
local
transferor
agrees
to
file
an
application.
our
position
is
that
the
--
would
be
transferee
is
not
required
to
incriminate
themselves.
the
burden
of
filing
the
application
is
on
the
transferor
under
the
statute.
now,
while
it’s
true
that
the
transferee,
the
proposed
transferee
must
submit
his
fingerprints
and
a
photograph,
these
have
never
been
thought
to
be
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
our
position
is
that
before
going
statutory
scheme
would
be
sufficient
without
more
to
sustain
the
indictment
against
appellees’
self-incrimination
challenge.
but
any
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
federal
national
firearms
act
is
resolve
we
believe
by
two
other
steps
that
congress
took
in
1968.
first,
it
repealed
26
u.s.c.
6107
which
provided
for
the
sharing
of
firearms
registration
and
transfer
information
with
other
law
enforcement
officials.
secondly,
it
enacted
section
5848
which
provides
that
no
information
provided
to
the
government
in
connection
with
the
registration
or
transfer
of
firearms
can
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
as
evidence
against
the
registrant
or
applicant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
involving
prior
or
concurrent
offenses.
while
the
immunity
from
used
provision
does
not
apply
to
future
crimes,
there
is
no
realistic
possibility
of
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
future
acts.
this
court
did
not
hold
as
a
general
rule
in
the
marchetti
case
that
the
possibility
of
future
incrimination
is
sufficient
to
justify
present
indication
of
the
privilege
in
all
circumstances.
on
a
contrary,
the
court
pointed
out
quite
clearly
that
in
most
instances
the
problem
of
future
conduct
will
not
give
rise
to
substantial
risks
of
self-incrimination.
the
marchetti
case
was
atypical
because
anyone
who
pays
the
occupational
tax
imposed
on
gamblers
can
be
expected
to
engage
in
gambling,
an
activity
that
is
prohibited
or
limited
in
49
states.
here
on
the
other
hand,
possession
of
one
type
or
another
of
the
kind
of
firearms
that
are
dealt
within
title
ii
is
permitted
by
state
law
as
evidence
by
the
fact
that
more
than
180,000
firearms
have
been
registered.
more
importantly,
unlike
the
situation
in
marchetti
and
application
to
transfer
will
only
be
approved
if
the
application
would
not
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
law.
at
the
similar
provision
been
operative
in
the
gambling
tax
area
only
gamblers
in
nevada
would’ve
attempted
to
register.
the
possibility
that
a
person
once
having
lawfully
obtained
possession
of
a
firearm
under
these
registration
provisions
would
subsequently
permit
an
unrelated
unlawful
act
and
that
the
prior
registration
will
incriminate
of
that
act
is
in
our
view
too
speculative
to
want
protection
of
the
privilege.
i
will
turn
briefly
to
the
due
process
issue.
this
breaks
down
into
two
sub-issues.
first,
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
that
violations
of
the
statute
can
be
punished
without
specific
intent
on
the
part
of
the
transferee
to
obtain
an
unregistered
firearm
and
secondly,
whether
if
congress
so
intended
as
we
submit
it
did
such
as
statute
runs
afoul
of
due
process
limitations.
on
the
first
aspect
of
this
but
we
don’t
believe
there's
any
substantial
problem.
nothing
in
the
statute
indicates
that
scienter
is
required.
moreover,
every
court
of
appeals
which
passed
on
this
question
under
the
old
national
firearms
act
which
in
so
far
as
pertinent
here
was
identical
to
the
new.
ever
held
anything
that
scienter
--
what
that
scienter
was
not
required
nor
does
anything
in
the
legislative
history
hint
that
congress
was
going
to
change
the
ground
rules
in
this
regard.
there
is
not
one
word
to
this
effect.
under
these
circumstances,
we
believe
it
would
be
wholly
improper
for
this
court
to
read
in
a
specific
intent
requirement
particularly
since
another
sub-section
of
the
same
provision
of
the
act
section
5861
(l)
expressly
requires
and
no
in
violation
for
prosecution
and
particularly
since
to
read
in
such
a
requirement
would
totally
frustrate
the
congressional
purpose
in
this
case.
finally,
as
to
the
due
process
claim,
as
we
understand
the
appellees
position
it
is
based
in
large
part
on
this
court’s
five
to
four
decision
in
lambert
against
california
which
found
repugnant
under
the
due
process
clause
on
los
angeles
ordinance
requiring
convicted
felons
who
spent
more
than
five
days
in
los
angeles
to
register
with
the
chief
of
police.
we
think
that
accepting
lambert
as
stating
the
present
possible
view
of
this
court
that
it
is
quite
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
situation
we
have
here.
we’re
not
concerned
with
somebody
passively
remaining
in
los
angeles
for
more
than
five
days.
we’re
concerned
here
with
people
acquiring
highly
dangerous
weapons,
hand
grenades
and
we
believe
that
the
authorities
of
this
court
as
early
as
the
balint
case
in
258
u.s.
which
dealt
with
narcotics
and
in
the
banger
and
barnett
case
in
255
u.s.
dealing
with
possession
of
dyes
for
the
making
of
government
coins
established
quite
clearly
that
this
kind
of
conduct
can
be
regulated
without
regard
to
a
specific
intent
requirement
but
no
more
than
congressional
reasonableness
in
this
area
of
involving
dangerous
weapons
as
necessary
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirements.
we
urge
therefore
that
the
indictment
be
reinstated
and
that
this
case
be
returned
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
matthew

yes,
sir.
mr.

i
believe
it
is.
mr.

of
an

mr.
matthew

yes.
mr.
matthew

of
our
brief
mr.
justice.
to
receive
or
possess
a
firearm
which
is
not
registered
to
him
in
the
national
firearms
act.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
there's
no
way
he
can
register.
the
crime
is
complete
under
this
act
when
he
receives
the
firearm.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
there's
no
--
that’s
correct
except
for
the
amnesty
period
to
which
you
referred
earlier.
there
is
no
way
that
a
recipient
of
an
unregistered
firearm
can
cure
his
failing.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
do
concede
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
true,
we
think
that
use
of
the
word
“possession”
in
count
two
is
a
self-sufficient
to
mean
conscious
possession
but
i
would
remind
this
court
that
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
under
18
u.s.c.
3731
and
that
if
the
court
resolves
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
or
construction
of
the
statute
in
our
favor
the
question
whether
the
count
two
sufficiently
states
the
offense
is
not
one
that
can
be
reached
by
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
goes
only
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
mr.
justice
stewart
and
quite
clearly
could
not
be
reached
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh!
yes
if
it
did.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
it
did
we
agree
that
we
could
not
be
here.
we
think
that
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
in
this
regard
as
the
dismissal
order
itself
mr.
justice
which
refers
only
to
the
constitutional
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
appellee’s
position
here
is
internally
inconsistent.
in
order
to
make
their
self-incrimination
argument
they
explained
that
the
appellees
were
incriminated
because
these
are
dangerous
weapons
and
even
if
they
just
register
them
lawfully
it’s
going
to
lead
to
their
exposure
for
some
future
crimes.
but
in
making
the
due
process
argument,
they
say
they
need
scienter.
if
the
weapons
are
so
dangerous
that
anybody
would
be
unnoticed
that
some
regulation
may
be
in
order,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
can't
make
the
due
process
argument
and
the
self-incrimination
argument
at
the
same
time.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
future
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i'm
suggesting
that
they’re
both
incorrect
mr.
justice
that
the
due
process
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
they
are
internally
inconsistent
but
looking
at
each
one
separately
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
i
think
both
are
bad.
as
far
as
due
process,
i
think
they
are
sufficiently
dangerous
to
put
somebody
unnoticed
that
they
are
to
acquire
before
they
take
possession
of
such
weapons
as
to
what
regulations
may
be
applicable
to
them.
as
far
as
the
self-incrimination
aspect,
the
only
possible
self-incrimination
is
for
future
incrimination
and
i
think
we
have
to
break
it
down
between
applications
that
are
accepted
on
the
one
hand
and
those
that
are
rejected
on
the
other.
as
for
applications
that
are
accepted,
i
think
it’s
far-fetched
to
think
that
somebody
who
goes
through
this
registration
procedure
and
is
entitled
to
take
possession
of
a
firearm,
a
hand
grenade
is
later
going
to
commit
an
unlawful
act.
completely
unrelated
to
the
possession
of
the
hand
grenades
such
as
blowing
up
a
building
and
that
this
registration
record
will
provide
a
link
in
the
chain,
that
is
far
most
speculative
than
the
kind
of
future
incrimination
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
the
marchetti
case.
now,
turning
to
applications
that
are
rejected,
i
think
it’s
important
for
me
to
make
clear
to
the
court
just
what
happens
to
those
applications.
if
they're
accepted,
they
have
to
become
part
of
the
national
firearms
transfer
and
registration
record.
if
they
are
rejected
they
do
not
become
part
of
that
record,
they
do
not
go
into
the
permanent
file.
we
are
advised
by
atfd
that
they're
go
into
a
correspondence
file
under
correspondence
with
the
trans
--
proposed
transferor
that
those
files
unlike
the
permanent
record
of
accepted
applications
are
purged
periodically
as
all
government
files
for
general
correspondence.
and
there's
just
no
record
of
a
rejected
application
that
could
incriminate
anybody.
finally,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
questions
which
appellees
continue
to
press
in
this
court
as
far
as
the
entrapment
question
i
refer
to
court
to
pages
26
and
38
of
the
record
appendix.
where
the
trial
judge
indicated
unmistakably
that
he
was
improving
on
entrapment
grounds
and
i
would
of
course
refer
the
court
to
the
dismissal
order
itself
where
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
going
lawful
beyond
the
constitutional
grounds.
as
for
appellees’
argument
in
reliance
on
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
mersky
case,
our
position
is
that
even
under
the
dissenter’s
view
this
court
properly
has
jurisdiction.
there's
no
question
here
about
the
meaning
of
the
regulations
as
there
was
in
mersky.
we’re
concerned
with
the
statute
itself,
the
regulations
merely
elaborate
the
statute.
the
requirements
imposed
upon
the
proposed
transferee
are
set
out
in
fairly
good
detail
in
section
5812
and
there's
no
basis
even
under
the
dissenting
opinion
in
mersky
for
a
conclusion
that
this
court
is
without
jurisdiction
under
18
u.s.c.
3731.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
seems
to
me
if
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
usually,
it
would
be
but
it
seems
to
me
if
the
court
adhered
to
the
views
expressed
by
the
majority
in
the
sorrels
and
sherman
case
that
the
question
of
entrapment
is
one
of
--
going
to
the
statutory
interpretation
--
going
to
statutory
interpretation
rather
than
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court.
it
is
conceivable
that
some
entrapment
issues
could
be
brought
directly
to
this
court
but
as
this
court
well
knows
the
criminal
appeals
act
has
now
been
--
is
now
being
faced
out
unfortunately
these
kinds
of
questions
won't
be
brought
here
directly
in
any
event.
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
in
most
cases
entrapment
would
be
a
question
of
fact
irrespective
of
which
view
of
entrapment
is
adopted
by
this
court
even
when
it’s
called
upon
to
pass
on
it.
it’s
not
involved
in
this
case
at
this
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government’s
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
dismissing
a
two-count
indictment
against
the
appellees,
the
first
for
conspiracy
to
possess
and
the
second
for
the
completed
substantive
act
of
possession
of
unregistered
hand
grenades
in
violation
of
26
u.s.c.
section
5861
(d).
that
provision
which
appears
on
page
4
of
our
brief
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
“to
receive
or
possess
a
firearm
which
is
not
registered
to
him
in
the
national
firearms
registration
and
transfer
record.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
harlan
only
hand
grenades.
and
i
guess
i
ought
to
point
out
now
although
i
was
going
to
do
so
later
that
the
provisions
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
do
not
apply
to
all
firearms,
but
generally
to
sawed-off
rifles
and
shotguns,
short-barrel
rifles
and
shotguns,
silencers,
machineguns,
other
automatic
weapons
and
destructive
devices
such
as
bombs,
rockets
and
hand
grenades.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
on
two
constitutional
grounds.
first,
it
ruled
that
section
5841
(c)
which
requires
that
certain
information
be
furnished
the
government
before
a
firearm
is
registered
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
before
a
firearm
is
transferred
and
section
5861
(d)
are
unconstitutional
because
section
5841
(c)
requires
appellees
to
furnish
evidence
incriminating
to
themselves
under
california
law
making
it
unlawful
to
possess
hand
grenades.
second,
the
district
court
rule
that
section
5861
(b)
violates
the
due
process
clause
because
it
does
not
require
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
that
a
transferee
obtained
possession
of
a
firearm
with
specific
knowledge
and
intent
that
the
firearm
be
unregistered.
section
5861
(d)
and
section
5841
(c)
were
enacted
as
part
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968.
that
act
was
passed
by
congress
in
response
to
the
violence
occurring
earlier
in
1968
and
to
the
fact
that
during
1967
more
than
130,000
people
in
the
united
states
were
victimized
by
gunman.
title
ii
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
would
which
is
concerned
here
substantially
amended
the
national
firearms
act
which
this
court
had
dealt
with
in
haynes
against
the
united
states
which
was
decided
in
january
of
1968
together
with
marchetti
and
grosso.
in
haynes,
this
court
concluded
that
the
old
registration
and
possession
provisions
of
the
national
firearms
act
compelled
self-incrimination
and
that
the
privilege
was
a
complete
defense
to
a
prosecution
under
either
the
possession
or
registration
provisions.
in
amending
the
national
firearms
act
in
october
of
1968,
congress
set
out
to
cure
the
constitutional
infirmities
which
were
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
opinion
as
existing
under
the
prior
statutory
scheme.
the
pertinent
legislative
history
is
replete
with
congressional
references
to
its
purpose
to
overcome
the
prior
infirmities
and
in
this
respect
the
congress
was
doing
just
what
mr.
justice
harlan
invited
it
to
do
in
his
opinion
in
haynes.
he
explained
that
a
valid
statute
could
be
enacted
which
would
achieve
substantially
the
same
purposes
as
the
statutory
scheme
dealt
with
by
the
court
in
haynes
and
which
would
not
run
a
foul
of
constitutional
limitations.
our
position
here
is
that
congress
has
done
just
this
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
it
is.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
at
the
outset
for
me
to
describe
briefly
how
the
new
national
firearms
act
works
in
actual
practice.
to
illustrate
the
provisions
of
the
new
act,
let
us
assume
that
a
manufacturer
who
is
license
to
manufacture
hand
grenades
in
fact
does
so.
he
is
required
to
register
the
hand
grenades
with
the
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
division
of
the
internal
revenue
service
that's
the
atfd
by
giving
notice
of
their
manufacture
and
of
the
serial
number
of
each
grenade.
this
is
required
by
section
5841
(d)
and
(c)
which
is
set
out
on
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief.
upon
giving
the
notice
to
the
atfd,
the
hand
grenades
are
then
registered
to
the
manufacturer.
if
he
wishes
to
transfer
them
to
another,
he
may
do
so
lawfully
and
the
transferee
may
receive
them
lawfully
only
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
5812
of
title
26
which
appears
on
page
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
under
section
5812,
a
grenade
may
not
be
transferred
unless
the
transferor
has
filed
the
requisite
application
in
duplicate
with
atfd
and
has
paid
the
transfer
tax
which
is
$200.00
in
the
case
of
grenade.
the
transferor,
the
transferee
and
the
firearm
to
be
transferred
must
be
identified
in
the
application.
in
addition,
they
must
be
appended
to
the
application
--
a
set
of
fingerprints
of
the
transferee,
his
photograph
and
a
statement
from
the
local
chief
of
police
or
other
similar
official
that
receive
or
possession
of
the
firearm
would
not
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
state
or
local
law.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
law
enforce
--
i
am
advised
that
there
are
collectors
mr.
justice
harlan,
people
who
like
to
have
more
trophies
and
much
to
my
own
surprise
some
people
just
like
to
have
rockets
--
live
rockets
or
live
bombs
in
their
basements
and
so
long
as
it’s
not
prohibited
by
state
law,
it’s
possible
to
do
that.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
don’t
really
know
what
they
do
with
them
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
more
than
180,000
firearms
described
in
title
ii
are
registered.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don’t
know
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
bombs
and
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right
plus
i
assume
the
cost
of
acquiring
the
firearm.
now,
admittedly
mr.
justice
most
of
the
firearms
registered
are
registered
to
law
enforcement
officials
but
there
are
substantial
numbers
in
museums
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
don’t
have
to
pay
the
tax,
but
except
in
the
case
of
a
firearm
in
the
possession
or
under
the
control
of
united
states.
the
application
must
be
filed
and
notice
must
be
given
that
is
being
transferred
to
a
local
official.
the
fact
remains
if
there
are
actually
people
who
enjoy
having
these
things.
as
i
have
said
that
in
addition
to
the
transferor’s
application,
there
is
appended
the
set
of
the
fingerprints
of
the
transferee,
his
photograph
and
a
statement
from
the
local
chief
of
police
that
receipt
or
possession
of
the
firearm
would
not
the
transferee
in
violation
of
local
law.
now,
this
package
is
sent
to
the
atfd
right
here
in
washington,
that
body
is
empowered
to
approve
an
application
only
if
and
this
is
critical
to
our
case
receipt
or
possession
of
the
firearm
would
not
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
state
local
or
federal
law.
if
atfd
rejects
an
application,
it
returns
the
original
application
and
gives
the
reasons
for
its
action.
if
it
approves
it
so
indicates
on
the
original
and
returns
it
to
the
transferor,
it
places
the
duplicate
in
the
national
firearms
transfer
and
registration
record.
only
after
the
transferor
has
received
the
approved
application,
is
he
permitted
to
transfer
the
firearm
to
the
transferee.
only
then
is
the
transferee
permitted
to
take
possession
of
the
firearm
and
only
then
when
he
takes
possession
together
with
the
approved
application
which
the
transferor
delivers
to
him
with
the
weapon.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
which
violate
local
or
federal
law
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right
similar
to
what
you
suggested
in
minor
and
buie.
i
should
like
before
turning
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
if
i
may
to
set
out
in
some
detail,
our
understanding
of
the
old
national
firearms
act
which
this
court
found
in
haynes.
the
old
section
5841
imposed
on
anyone
possessing
a
firearm,
the
duty
to
register
that
firearm
unless
it
had
been
made
or
transferred
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
old
act.
but
if
a
person
possessing
a
firearm
required
to
be
registered
came
forward
to
register
under
the
old
act,
he
necessarily
incriminated
himself
for
possession
of
a
firearm
that
had
been
made
or
transferred
in
violation
of
the
act
which
was
proscribed
by
the
old
section
5851.
in
short,
a
person
was
required
to
come
forward
to
comply
with
one
provision
of
the
statutory
scheme,
but
if
the
risk
of
incriminating
himself
under
another
provision
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
subsequently
in
the
minor
and
buie
case
last
term
the
vice
of
the
old
national
firearms
act
was
the
same
vice
that
this
court
found
existed
with
respect
to
the
occupational
and
excise
taxes
on
gamblers
in
the
marchetti
and
grosso
cases.
in
those
cases,
a
person
was
required
to
come
forward
and
reveal
information
as
to
his
gambling
activities
to
federal
authorities
even
though
disclosure
of
those
activities
could
be
made
to
other
federal
authorities
and
to
state
authorities
and
even
though
such
activities
were
proscribed
by
both
state
and
federal
law.
moreover,
mr.
justice
harlan
found
in
haynes
that
under
the
old
statute,
the
only
persons
required
to
register
were
those
unlawfully
in
possession
of
firearms.
the
registration
requirements
thus
applied
only
to
those
inherently
suspect
of
criminality
as
did
the
requirement
held
impermissible
in
the
albertson
case.
in
the
new
national
firearms
act,
congress
has
eliminated
any
possibility
of
self-incrimination
of
a
transferee
of
a
firearm
whereas
the
old
statute
required
registration
only
by
those
unlawfully
in
possession
of
firearms.
the
new
statute
requires
registration
by
all
possesses
of
firearms
with
the
single
exception
of
the
united
states.
appellees
do
not
dispute
this.
second,
under
the
new
statute,
the
only
persons
permitted
to
accept
possession
of
firearms
are
those
whose
possession
would
not
place
them
in
violation
of
law.
in
so
far
as
relevant
here,
this
limitation
is
spelled
out
in
the
last
sentence
of
section
5812
(a)
which
appears
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
thus,
unlike
the
situation
in
haynes
not
only
does
a
person
unlawfully
in
possession
not
have
a
duty
to
come
forward
and
admit
his
unlawful
possession,
but
he
cannot
register
firearm.
a
person
is
not
compelled
as
he
was
in
haynes
to
come
forward
under
one
provision
only
to
be
incriminating
himself
under
another.
completion
of
the
substantive
crime
under
the
new
act
occurs
when
a
person
accepts
possession
before
the
atfd
has
approved
the
transfer
to
him.
after
that,
there
is
no
duty
imposed
upon
the
unlawful
transferee
as
there
was
in
haynes
and
if
he
is
convicted
of
unlawful
possession
it
is
not
because
of
any
information
he
furnished
but
simply
because
of
his
unlawful
possession.
the
appellees’
position
here
is
not
that
they
are
whipsawed
between
one
provision
of
the
federal
statute
and
another
as
was
the
petitioner
in
haynes.
they
make
no
such
contention,
they
allege
only
that
the
self-incrimination
has
it
for
them
arises
because
california
law
prohibits
them
from
possessing
hand
grenades.
but
since
the
statute
provides
that
atfd
may
approve
a
transfer
only
if
it
is
lawful
under
california
law.
appellees
would
not
self-incrimination
under
that
law
by
complying
with
the
federal
requirements.
the
possession
by
appellees
would
be
unlawful
under
california
law,
the
application
to
transfer
would
be
denied
by
atfd.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
that
atfd
would
make
a
judgment
as
to
its
opinion
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
has
codified
or
i
should
say
collected
all
the
local
laws
and
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
real
dispute
however
about
california
law
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
say
in
substance
it
was
mr.
justice.
there
is
a
very
short
record
appendix
and
i
think
that
you
will
see
that
the
essence
of
the
arguments
was
made
if
not
in
the
full
detail
which
we
are
making
them
here
and
it
would
--
we
made
in
our
brief.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
appellees
are
in
the
same
position
as
what
the
seller
of
narcotics
in
the
minor
case
which
was
decided
last
term.
if
that
person
would
be
an
unlawful
transferee,
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
approach
someone
who
is
lawfully
in
possession
in
order
to
obtain
a
firearm.
it
is
for
more
likely
that
he
would
approach
it
would
transferor
who
is
unlawfully
in
possession.
and
if
the
transferor
is
unlawfully
in
possession,
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
transfer
the
firearm
to
the
transferee
under
the
provisions
of
the
new
national
firearms
act.
the
act
provides
that
weapons
may
be
transferred
only
by
those
lawfully
in
possession.
in
the
unusual
case
where
he
does
approach
a
lawful
transferee
it
seems
to
us
unlikely
that
such
a
transferee
would
file
an
application
for
transfer
knowing
that
it
would
be
rejected
because
the
possession
of
the
firearm
would
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
local
law.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
the
statute
was
passed
or
enacted
into
law
on
october
22,
1968.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
they
were
in
the
records
of
the
atfd
before
the
new
act
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
never
registered.
the
act
set
a
30-day
amnesty
period,
beginning
on
november
1
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
that’s
not
this
case
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
i
don’t
think
it
--
well,
it
is
a
different
case
but
our
position
is
that
even
that
situation
would
not
run
afoul
of
constitutional
limitations.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
used
limitation,
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
will
in
just
one
moment.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir.
even
in
a
case
where
the
would
be
transferee
approaches
a
lawful
transferor
and
the
local
transferor
agrees
to
file
an
application.
our
position
is
that
the
--
would
be
transferee
is
not
required
to
incriminate
themselves.
the
burden
of
filing
the
application
is
on
the
transferor
under
the
statute.
now,
while
it’s
true
that
the
transferee,
the
proposed
transferee
must
submit
his
fingerprints
and
a
photograph,
these
have
never
been
thought
to
be
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
our
position
is
that
before
going
statutory
scheme
would
be
sufficient
without
more
to
sustain
the
indictment
against
appellees’
self-incrimination
challenge.
but
any
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
federal
national
firearms
act
is
resolve
we
believe
by
two
other
steps
that
congress
took
in
1968.
first,
it
repealed
26
u.s.c.
6107
which
provided
for
the
sharing
of
firearms
registration
and
transfer
information
with
other
law
enforcement
officials.
secondly,
it
enacted
section
5848
which
provides
that
no
information
provided
to
the
government
in
connection
with
the
registration
or
transfer
of
firearms
can
be
used
directly
or
indirectly
as
evidence
against
the
registrant
or
applicant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
involving
prior
or
concurrent
offenses.
while
the
immunity
from
used
provision
does
not
apply
to
future
crimes,
there
is
no
realistic
possibility
of
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
future
acts.
this
court
did
not
hold
as
a
general
rule
in
the
marchetti
case
that
the
possibility
of
future
incrimination
is
sufficient
to
justify
present
indication
of
the
privilege
in
all
circumstances.
on
a
contrary,
the
court
pointed
out
quite
clearly
that
in
most
instances
the
problem
of
future
conduct
will
not
give
rise
to
substantial
risks
of
self-incrimination.
the
marchetti
case
was
atypical
because
anyone
who
pays
the
occupational
tax
imposed
on
gamblers
can
be
expected
to
engage
in
gambling,
an
activity
that
is
prohibited
or
limited
in
49
states.
here
on
the
other
hand,
possession
of
one
type
or
another
of
the
kind
of
firearms
that
are
dealt
within
title
ii
is
permitted
by
state
law
as
evidence
by
the
fact
that
more
than
180,000
firearms
have
been
registered.
more
importantly,
unlike
the
situation
in
marchetti
and
application
to
transfer
will
only
be
approved
if
the
application
would
not
place
the
transferee
in
violation
of
law.
at
the
similar
provision
been
operative
in
the
gambling
tax
area
only
gamblers
in
nevada
would’ve
attempted
to
register.
the
possibility
that
a
person
once
having
lawfully
obtained
possession
of
a
firearm
under
these
registration
provisions
would
subsequently
permit
an
unrelated
unlawful
act
and
that
the
prior
registration
will
incriminate
of
that
act
is
in
our
view
too
speculative
to
want
protection
of
the
privilege.
i
will
turn
briefly
to
the
due
process
issue.
this
breaks
down
into
two
sub-issues.
first,
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
that
violations
of
the
statute
can
be
punished
without
specific
intent
on
the
part
of
the
transferee
to
obtain
an
unregistered
firearm
and
secondly,
whether
if
congress
so
intended
as
we
submit
it
did
such
as
statute
runs
afoul
of
due
process
limitations.
on
the
first
aspect
of
this
but
we
don’t
believe
there's
any
substantial
problem.
nothing
in
the
statute
indicates
that
scienter
is
required.
moreover,
every
court
of
appeals
which
passed
on
this
question
under
the
old
national
firearms
act
which
in
so
far
as
pertinent
here
was
identical
to
the
new.
ever
held
anything
that
scienter
--
what
that
scienter
was
not
required
nor
does
anything
in
the
legislative
history
hint
that
congress
was
going
to
change
the
ground
rules
in
this
regard.
there
is
not
one
word
to
this
effect.
under
these
circumstances,
we
believe
it
would
be
wholly
improper
for
this
court
to
read
in
a
specific
intent
requirement
particularly
since
another
sub-section
of
the
same
provision
of
the
act
section
5861
(l)
expressly
requires
and
no
in
violation
for
prosecution
and
particularly
since
to
read
in
such
a
requirement
would
totally
frustrate
the
congressional
purpose
in
this
case.
finally,
as
to
the
due
process
claim,
as
we
understand
the
appellees
position
it
is
based
in
large
part
on
this
court’s
five
to
four
decision
in
lambert
against
california
which
found
repugnant
under
the
due
process
clause
on
los
angeles
ordinance
requiring
convicted
felons
who
spent
more
than
five
days
in
los
angeles
to
register
with
the
chief
of
police.
we
think
that
accepting
lambert
as
stating
the
present
possible
view
of
this
court
that
it
is
quite
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
situation
we
have
here.
we’re
not
concerned
with
somebody
passively
remaining
in
los
angeles
for
more
than
five
days.
we’re
concerned
here
with
people
acquiring
highly
dangerous
weapons,
hand
grenades
and
we
believe
that
the
authorities
of
this
court
as
early
as
the
balint
case
in
258
u.s.
which
dealt
with
narcotics
and
in
the
banger
and
barnett
case
in
255
u.s.
dealing
with
possession
of
dyes
for
the
making
of
government
coins
established
quite
clearly
that
this
kind
of
conduct
can
be
regulated
without
regard
to
a
specific
intent
requirement
but
no
more
than
congressional
reasonableness
in
this
area
of
involving
dangerous
weapons
as
necessary
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirements.
we
urge
therefore
that
the
indictment
be
reinstated
and
that
this
case
be
returned
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
receiving
an
unregistered
firearm,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
possessing
of
an
unregistered
firearms?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
to
receive
or
possess
page
4
of
our
brief
mr.
justice.
to
receive
or
possess
a
firearm
which
is
not
registered
to
him
in
the
national
firearms
act.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
there's
no
way
he
can
register.
the
crime
is
complete
under
this
act
when
he
receives
the
firearm.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
there's
no
--
that’s
correct
except
for
the
amnesty
period
to
which
you
referred
earlier.
there
is
no
way
that
a
recipient
of
an
unregistered
firearm
can
cure
his
failing.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
do
concede
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
true,
we
think
that
use
of
the
word
“possession”
in
count
two
is
a
self-sufficient
to
mean
conscious
possession
but
i
would
remind
this
court
that
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
under
18
u.s.c.
3731
and
that
if
the
court
resolves
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
or
construction
of
the
statute
in
our
favor
the
question
whether
the
count
two
sufficiently
states
the
offense
is
not
one
that
can
be
reached
by
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
goes
only
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
mr.
justice
stewart
and
quite
clearly
could
not
be
reached
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh!
yes
if
it
did.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
it
did
we
agree
that
we
could
not
be
here.
we
think
that
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
in
this
regard
as
the
dismissal
order
itself
mr.
justice
which
refers
only
to
the
constitutional
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
appellee’s
position
here
is
internally
inconsistent.
in
order
to
make
their
self-incrimination
argument
they
explained
that
the
appellees
were
incriminated
because
these
are
dangerous
weapons
and
even
if
they
just
register
them
lawfully
it’s
going
to
lead
to
their
exposure
for
some
future
crimes.
but
in
making
the
due
process
argument,
they
say
they
need
scienter.
if
the
weapons
are
so
dangerous
that
anybody
would
be
unnoticed
that
some
regulation
may
be
in
order,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
can't
make
the
due
process
argument
and
the
self-incrimination
argument
at
the
same
time.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
future
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i'm
suggesting
that
they’re
both
incorrect
mr.
justice
that
the
due
process
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
they
are
internally
inconsistent
but
looking
at
each
one
separately
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
i
think
both
are
bad.
as
far
as
due
process,
i
think
they
are
sufficiently
dangerous
to
put
somebody
unnoticed
that
they
are
to
acquire
before
they
take
possession
of
such
weapons
as
to
what
regulations
may
be
applicable
to
them.
as
far
as
the
self-incrimination
aspect,
the
only
possible
self-incrimination
is
for
future
incrimination
and
i
think
we
have
to
break
it
down
between
applications
that
are
accepted
on
the
one
hand
and
those
that
are
rejected
on
the
other.
as
for
applications
that
are
accepted,
i
think
it’s
far-fetched
to
think
that
somebody
who
goes
through
this
registration
procedure
and
is
entitled
to
take
possession
of
a
firearm,
a
hand
grenade
is
later
going
to
commit
an
unlawful
act.
completely
unrelated
to
the
possession
of
the
hand
grenades
such
as
blowing
up
a
building
and
that
this
registration
record
will
provide
a
link
in
the
chain,
that
is
far
most
speculative
than
the
kind
of
future
incrimination
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
the
marchetti
case.
now,
turning
to
applications
that
are
rejected,
i
think
it’s
important
for
me
to
make
clear
to
the
court
just
what
happens
to
those
applications.
if
they're
accepted,
they
have
to
become
part
of
the
national
firearms
transfer
and
registration
record.
if
they
are
rejected
they
do
not
become
part
of
that
record,
they
do
not
go
into
the
permanent
file.
we
are
advised
by
atfd
that
they're
go
into
a
correspondence
file
under
correspondence
with
the
trans
--
proposed
transferor
that
those
files
unlike
the
permanent
record
of
accepted
applications
are
purged
periodically
as
all
government
files
for
general
correspondence.
and
there's
just
no
record
of
a
rejected
application
that
could
incriminate
anybody.
finally,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
questions
which
appellees
continue
to
press
in
this
court
as
far
as
the
entrapment
question
i
refer
to
court
to
pages
26
and
38
of
the
record
appendix.
where
the
trial
judge
indicated
unmistakably
that
he
was
improving
on
entrapment
grounds
and
i
would
of
course
refer
the
court
to
the
dismissal
order
itself
where
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
going
lawful
beyond
the
constitutional
grounds.
as
for
appellees’
argument
in
reliance
on
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
mersky
case,
our
position
is
that
even
under
the
dissenter’s
view
this
court
properly
has
jurisdiction.
there's
no
question
here
about
the
meaning
of
the
regulations
as
there
was
in
mersky.
we’re
concerned
with
the
statute
itself,
the
regulations
merely
elaborate
the
statute.
the
requirements
imposed
upon
the
proposed
transferee
are
set
out
in
fairly
good
detail
in
section
5812
and
there's
no
basis
even
under
the
dissenting
opinion
in
mersky
for
a
conclusion
that
this
court
is
without
jurisdiction
under
18
u.s.c.
3731.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
seems
to
me
if
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
usually,
it
would
be
but
it
seems
to
me
if
the
court
adhered
to
the
views
expressed
by
the
majority
in
the
sorrels
and
sherman
case
that
the
question
of
entrapment
is
one
of
--
going
to
the
statutory
interpretation
--
going
to
statutory
interpretation
rather
than
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court.
it
is
conceivable
that
some
entrapment
issues
could
be
brought
directly
to
this
court
but
as
this
court
well
knows
the
criminal
appeals
act
has
now
been
--
is
now
being
faced
out
unfortunately
these
kinds
of
questions
won't
be
brought
here
directly
in
any
event.
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
in
most
cases
entrapment
would
be
a
question
of
fact
irrespective
of
which
view
of
entrapment
is
adopted
by
this
court
even
when
it’s
called
upon
to
pass
on
it.
it’s
not
involved
in
this
case
at
this
time.
