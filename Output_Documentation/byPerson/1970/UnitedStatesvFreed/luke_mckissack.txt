mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
begin
by
referring
to
just
a
few
moments
to
an
issue
that
we
raised
when
the
appellants
sought
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
we
suggested
at
that
time
that
perhaps
this
court
do
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
i
just
like
to
make
couple
of
comments
along
that
line.
we
suggest
that
an
examination
of
the
appendix
which
contains
the
colloquy
in
the
trial
court
between
the
judge
and
attorney
etcetera
will
indicate
that
the
judges’
decision
was
quite
highbred
and
was
based
upon
a
number
of
considerations
that
it’s
replete
with
notion
that
the
judge
felt
that
in
as
much
as
the
bill
of
particulars
inform
the
court
that
what
actually
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
los
angeles
police
department
officer
apparently
and
conjunction
with
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
people
of
the
federal
government
had
gone
to
the
long
beach
arsenal
and
picked
up
a
hand
grenade
and
he
himself
had
sought
no
exemption
which
is
available
to
him
and
it
deliberately
flouted
the
law
and
did
not
obey
the
law.
and
only
by
his
action
that
he
caused
the
transferees
to
become
criminals
of
criminal
at
all,
he
suggested
that
this
might
amount
to
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
merely
say
that’s
not
to
say
that
necessarily
this
was
even
the
correct
decision
even
though
it
would
appear
that
he
was
following
the
line
of
thinking
of
the
concurring
justices
in
the
sorrel
and
sherman
thinking.
basically,
that
society
really
has
no
interest
in
trying
to
transform
inchoate
criminals
and
actual
ones.
but
whether
or
not,
this
is
a
correct
interpretation
to
this
court
would
follow
it
today,
i
think
it
does
recognize
the
fact
that
the
judge
was
thinking
along
that
line.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
but
what
we’re
talking
--
well,
because
the
conduct
of
the
police
officer
creates
the
crime
without
which
there
would
be
no
crime.
mr.
luke
mckissack
if
he
complied
with
the
law
the
transferee
would’ve
not
committed
the
crime,
that's
correct.
mr.
luke
mckissack
in
other
words,
the
police
officer
by
violating
the
law
and
created
the
criminal
that
is
the
transferee.
had
the
police
officer
done
what
the
law
required,
the
transferee
would
not
been
a
criminal.
only
because
of
the
activities
of
the
police
officer
did
the
transferee
become
a
criminal
and
this
was
the
thinking
expressed
by
the
court.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
statutory
history,
or
one
way
or
the
other
the
appellants
concede
for
example
that
it’s
entirely
silent
and
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
much
discussion
at
all
other
than
the
fact
that
if
you
like,
they
like
to
get
around
the
haynes
decision
in
passing
the
legislation.
i
don’t
know
--
there's
nothing
in
their
suggesting
that
the
transferee
should
have
any
affirmative
burden.
i
know
nothing
in
the
legislative
hearings
to
say
that
and
there's
no
basis
for
really
assuming
that
he
has
any
kind
of
a
burden.
as
i
say
the
statute
is
entirely
silent,
but
i'm
saying
in
this
case
that
we’re
not
talking
about
prosecution
under
state
charge,
we’re
not
talking
about
using
the
commerce
clause
which
perhaps
the
congress
could
to
make
just
raw
possession
a
crime.
we’re
talking
about
something
that’s
a
crime
only
because
the
transferee
takes
possession
of
something
which
the
transferor
has
failed
to
do
and
in
this
case
the
transferor
is
an
agent
of
the
government
and
acts
knowingly.
and
the
judge
did
considerable
thinking
along
that
lines
and
i
would
suggest
that
an
examination
of
his
thinking
would
show
that
perhaps
it
would
put
this
case
outside
the
legitimacy
of
the
appeal
and
i
would
merely
add
to
that
that
we’re
not
just
talking
about
interpretation
of
federal
statutes
here.
but
for
those
dissenters
in
the
mirsky
decision
that
we
have
involved
the
number
of
integral
treasury
regulations.
some
of
them
which
preexisted
the
haynes
decision
and
haven’t
even
been
altered
in
a
couple
of
them
which
don’t
even
make
the
change
between
transferee
and
transferor
and
there
are
some
interpretation
of
the
treasury
regulations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
the
self-incrimination
material
which
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute
is
found
in
its
treasury
regulations
rather
than
in
the
official
statutes.
because
the
statutes
will
say
that
the
transferor
must
do
certain
things
to
have
the
weapon
registered
and
the
transferee
must
do
certain
things
which
must
be
specified
by
the
secretary
of
treasury,
his
authorized
delegate.
and
then
in
certain
of
this
sections
178.9
(a)
etcetera
it
explains
that
there
has
to
be
--
there's
an
affirmative
obligation
of
the
transferee
to
get
a
photograph
of
himself
which
is
no
more
than
one-year-old
and
plaster
that
on
the
application.
he
has
to
put
his
fingerprints
on
there,
it
has
to
be
an
identification
in
the
serial
number
of
the
weapon
etcetera
and
all
of
these
things
then
there
has
to
be
an
approval
by
a
sheriff
or
a
police
official
or
someone
who
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
finds
it
suitable
to
verify
that
this
is
his
photograph
and
this
is
his
identification
and
it’s
going
to
be
use
lawfully.
and
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
don’t
think
that
only
goes
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
terms
of
what
you
actually
have
to
do,
but
if
you
take
the
raw
activity
of
something
let’s
say
we
have
no
fifth
amendment,
nothing
testimonial
about
say
a
fingerprint
or
the
handwriting
is
similar.
the
majority
of
the
court
is
disposed
to
that
opinion.
but
if
you
take
that
material
and
you
require
the
person
to
lay
that
information
on
top
of
something
which
amounts
to
an
attestation
that
he
is
seeking
to
take
possession
of
hand
grenades
which
would
then
amount
to
perhaps
the
conspiracy
to
violate
california
law
or
maybe
even
an
attempt.
and
that
the
very
minimum
a
furnish
that
link
in
the
chain
that
this
man
maybe
a
person
who’s
desirous
of
buying
hand
grenades
and
if
the
authorization
doesn’t
go
through
you
go
ahead
and
purchase
at
any
house
so
they
can
key
on
his
house
or
on
his
business.
i
suggest
this
is
highly
incriminatory,
i
don’t
think
it
can
be
simply
head
noted
by
just
calling
it
a
fingerprint
case
or
a
photograph.
i
think
it’s
the
totality
of
the
context
and
when
these
things
appear
and
in
fact
there
has
to
be
a
witness
to
it
which
is
a
witness
for
the
government
who’s
standing
ready
to
testify
in
a
state
proceeding
against
the
man
who
does
these
things.
i
think
when
it’s
put
in
the
context
of
saying
i'm
going
to
take
possession
of
hand
grenade
that
certainly
has
a
testimonial
character
and
this
would
be
our
position.
but
just
to
sum
up
this
point
because
i
want
to
move
on
to
the
others
i
think
there
is
a
serious
question
on
two
grounds
as
to
whether
this
court
should
or
can
retain
jurisdiction.
a
probable
jurisdiction
has
been
noted
but
there
is
the
question
of
to
what
extent
the
judge
realizing
the
treasury
regulations
as
opposed
to
the
statutes
for
those
justices
who
think
that’s
important.
and
secondly,
there's
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
more
than
just
a
determination
of
self-incrimination
or
scienter
with
an
investigation
of
the
facts
and
rightfully
or
wrongfully
a
determination
by
judge
ferguson
that
this
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
if
i
may
in
reversal
to
go
perhaps
to
the
issue
of
scienter.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
an
allegation
of
any
kind
of
knowledge
here
and
the
judge
of
the
trial
level
found
that
as
we
see
the
indictment
neither
the
statute
nor
the
indictment
requires
any
kind
of
scienter.
not
even
the
most
minimal
kind,
not
even
that
congress
says
that
the
transferee
knows
that
he
has
something
and
knows
what
he
has,
that
is
its
characteristics,
because
its
hand
grenade
or
whatever
firearm.
much
less
does
it
allege
that
he
knows
that
it
was
unregistered
at
the
time
of
its
receipt
and
none
of
these
are
alleged
and
if
you
would
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
we’re
talking
only
about
count
two
of
the
indictment
at
that
point,
yes
sir.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes
it
does
just
through
the
--
i
have
a
quarrel
with
count
one
of
the
indictment
or
another
for
another
reason
but
at
that
point,
no.
count
two
we’re
talking
about,
there's
no
kind
of
scienter
or
whatsoever.
now,
the
government
below
conceded
the
government
here
conceded
that
the
scienter
had
to
be
proved.
so
the
question
is,
does
the
indictment
have
to
obtain
and
have
to
spell
out
some
kind
of
scienter
requirement.
and
although
this
would
not
be
perhaps
the
place
to
reinvestigate
the
whole
function
of
the
grand
jury
system
etcetera,
i
assume
that
the
--
as
the
statute
was
laid
out,
it
was
laid
out
to
the
grand
jurors
and
even
they
in
passing
prima
facie
on
some
kind
of
responsibility
that
would
justify
taking
the
man
to
trial
would
not
or
have
knowledge
apparently
that
the
transferee
was
suppose
to
know
what
he
had
and
all
the
character
what
he
had.
so
we
don’t
know
anything
about
the
findings
here.
secondly,
as
i
say
there
is
a
string
of
cases
saying
that
the
indictment
has
to
allege
this
and
it
can't
be
cured
by
bill
of
particulars
as
the
old
caryll
case
which
i
referred
to
where
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
allege
the
necessary
scienter
requirement
that
renders
it
fatal
and
i
will
suggest
that
on
that
ground
that
the
indictment
in
this
case
is
deficient.
not
only
that
i
feel
that
the
statute
is
deficient
because
it
doesn’t
have
any
allegation
of
even
that
general
kind
of
knowledge.
there
is
in
the
government’s
brief
footnote
9
on
page
14,
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
a
statute
without
any
kind
of
scienter
could
reach
ridiculous
results
and
they
point
that
out.
they
suggest
the
remedy
is
that
if
you
have
a
noble
prosecutor
that
he
won't
prosecute
and
the
same
question
was
argued
again
before
judge
ferguson
and
he
seem
to
feel
that
there
should
be
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
and
this
was
an
adequate
answer
and
consequently
at
page
38
of
the
appendix,
they
insist
that
the
government
must
allege
scienter.
now,
i
also
make
the
argument
that
regarding
count
one,
if
we
take
the
reigning
law
in
this
country
that
when
we
have
the
conspiracy
to
violate
a
particular
statute
that
it
requires
a
more
of
an
intent
than
in
a
substantive
crime
and
we
definitely
involve
knowledge
of
the
law
in
an
attempt
to
run
afoul
of
the
law
and
there
are
string
of
cases
that
are
cited
state
cases
and
federal
cases.
indicating
if
that’s
the
case
at
least
in
so
far
as
mowlem
prohibit
to
more
public
welfare
crimes
are
concerned.
i
don’t
think
that
either
one
of
those
terms
are
too
helpful
in
trying
to
decide
on
whether
the
--
there
had
been
many
--
much
dispute
and
many
text
writers
who
have
had
argument
as
to
what
fits
in
their
category.
but
some
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
for
example
to
refer
to
the
mann
act,
white
slavery,
allegations
of
fraud
and
things
of
that
sort.
they
are
generically
different
and
say
perhaps
the
possession
of
firearms
in
this
case
in
terms
of
perhaps
the
gravity
of
the
action.
and
nevertheless
the
conspiracy
must
embrace
an
intent
to
run
afoul
of
the
law
and
that
is
not
alleged
and
that
was
another
one
of
the
grounds
which
the
trial
court
used
for
dismissing
the
indictment.
now,
on
the
issue
of
the
allegation
of
scienter
in
so
far
as
the
unregistered
character
of
the
firearm
is
concerned
that
it’s
our
contention
that
this
is
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
although
we
cite
the
lambert
decision,
we
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
as
having
totally
rely
upon
that.
there's
no
question
that
simplest
term
is
an
example
of
where
the
court
has
decided
all
things
considered
that
ignorance
of
the
law
must
be
an
excuse
--
the
majority
of
the
court
so
held.
but
here,
we
really
not
even
talking
about
ignorance
of
the
law,
we’re
talking
if
anything
about
one
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
let
me
distinguish
two
situations
where
crime
involved
here.
in
other
words,
the
defense
is
not
that
the
defendants
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
law
saying
that
you
could
not
possess
a
firearm
unless
it
was
registered.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
one
of
the
elements
which
should
be
pled
and
proved
is
that
the
defendants
took
possession
of
firearm
knowing
that
the
transferor
had
not
had
it
registered
and
there's
a
world
of
difference
because
as
the
one
case
we’re
talking
about
just
not
knowing
what
the
law
is
and
the
person
is
presumed
to
know
the
law.
here,
we’re
talking
about
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
that
brings
the
legal
proposition
into
play
and
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
is
the
characterization
of
the
weapon
being
taken
and
that
characterization
is
that
it
is
of
unregistered
character.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
scienter
requirements
should
reach
this
far
and
the
question
of
analysis
of
what
kind
of
scienter
this
court
should
decide
the
statute
intended
to
contain
or
it’s
a
matter
of
due
process.
i’ve
gone
to
the
various
authorities
of
analyze
the
whole
notion
of
mens
rea,
history
etcetera
and
i'm
disposed
to
think
that
perhaps
the
court
should
reevaluate
the
whole
area
and
i
have
sort
of
find
of
sayers
test
when
he
talks
about
the
fact
that
when
we
get
to
a
crime
that’s
sufficiently
grave.
that
is
clear
as
just
not
a
regulatory
measure.
we
were
trying
to
single
out
raw
and
wrongdoers
for
criminal
treatment
which
was
expressed
in
the
law
before
haynes.
it
have
been
re-expressed
that
they’re
trying
to
do
away
with
people
who
are
engaged
in
wrongful
acts
and
have
even
expanded
the
number
of
weapons
to
cover
rockets
and
missiles
and
things
like
this
which
are
not
normally
possessed
by
people
just
for
hobbies.
and
secondly,
where
the
imprisonment
is
too
grave
to
allow
the
deletion
of
mens
rea
as
he
puts
it.
i
think
the
court
should
at
that
point
intercede
and
require
a
stronger
scienter
requirement
or
in
the
absence
of
any
legislative
finding
that
is
not
required,
the
court
should
assume
that
it
should
be
there
based
upon
the
common
law
history
and
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
now,
this
crime
is
count
two
for
example
carries
a
penalty
about
to
10
years
or
$10,000.00.
formally,
it
was
five
years
or
$5,000.00.
the
court
might
wish
borrow
by
analogy
from
its
decisions
in
the
area
of
where
they
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
evaluating
the
potential
length
of
sentence
or
the
actual
sentence
or
its
decisions
in
the
question
of
right
to
counsel
is
to
whether
you
may
be
have
a
right
to
counsel
for
a
traffic
ticket
or
as
opposed
to
say
a
felony
or
major
felony
or
major
misdemeanor
and
i
think
perhaps
some
of
the
same
considerations
that
go
into
making
a
decision
is
to
whether
it’s
significant
enough
to
attach
the
right
to
counsel
to
insist
on
the
right
to
jury
might
also
be
implemented
here
in
deciding
whether
or
not
we
can
have
a
strict
liability
statute
or
in
effect
punish
somebody
for
a
crime
is
not
meant
to
be
a
crime
unless
we
are
possessing
an
unregistered
firearm
and
say
that
the
person
doesn’t
have
to
have
knowledge
of
it.
again,
i
repeat
i
know
nothing
in
the
statutory
history
that
causes
a
person
to
have
to
seek
out,
and
finally
whether
or
not
the
weapon
has
been
registered.
it
has
been
suggested
by
the
appellant
in
his
brief
that
if
you're
dealing
with
firearms
or
you're
dealing
with
hand
grenades
you
must
know
that
there
some
kind
of
requirement
that
they
be
treated
this
way.
i
subject
that
this
is
--
suggest
that
this
is
just
a
matter
of
speculation.
if
i
were
taking
a
possession
of
a
firearm
or
hand
grenade
i
might
think
a
number
of
things.
one
thing
i
might
think
is,
this
is
just
totally
illegal
and
i
better
not
get
caught
with
it.
a
second
thing
i
might
think
is
that
perhaps
it’s
illegal
but
it
may
not
be
illegal
to
possess
but
i’d
better
be
careful
what
i
do
with
it
and
if
put
on
the
mantelpiece
it’s
okay.
thirdly,
i
might
to
think
that
perhaps
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
permit
in
order
to
get
it.
fourthly,
i
might
think
that
it’s
alright
for
me
to
take
possession
of
it
but
after
i
do
so
i
better
report
it
to
someone
and
register
it.
and
if
a
person
was
guilty
for
example
of
quite
reasonable
kind
of
thinking
the
fourth
type
that
certainly
you
would
have
to
have
a
statute
which
would
allow
reasonable
period
of
time
to
register
the
weapon
and
as
the
appellant
candidly
concedes.
once
the
purpose
takes
possession
of
it
that
is
the
crime
and
there’s
nothing
on
earth
that
he
can
do
to
make
himself
law-abiding
thereafter.
so,
i
just
think
the
fact
that
we’re
dealing
with
hand
grenades
should
not
cause
the
court
to
feel
like
a
strong
mens
rea
requirement
should
not
be
exacted
when
we’re
talking
about
a
very
severe
crime
with
a
great
deal
of
gravity.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that’s
a
tricky
question
and
i
suggest
i
have
some
thoughts
on
it
but
on
either
basis
i
think
the
court
might
say
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
but
if
it
chooses
not
to
put
on
that
basis,
i
think
it
would
be
a
reasonable
statement
to
say
that
when
we’re
talking
about
this
kind
of
crime
with
this
kind
of
penalty
that
congress
should
have
the
affirmative
obligation
of
making
a
quite
express
as
to
whether
they
feel
they
want
strict
liability
or
whether
they're
going
to
eliminate
the
mens
rea
requirement
rather
than
to
rely
upon
the
position
of
the
appellant
which
is
because
it’s
not
spelled
out
in
the
statute
that
congress
never
intended
to
be
there.
i
don’t
see
anything
inherently
unfair
or
imprudent
about
asking
congress
to
do
that
given
the
huge
common
law
background
and
given
the
gravity
of
the
offense
and
all
of
the
statements
to
the
effect
that
mens
rea
in
grave
crimes
does
play
a
great
role
in
our
jurisprudence
and
i
see
no
great
imposition
on
congress.
they
can
hold
hearings.
it
would
be
very
simple
to
pass
a
statute
and
say,
that
we
find
based
upon
in
information
that
only
way
we
can
control
these
weapons
or
get
them
properly
taxed
is
to
do
such
and
such
and
if
we
put
the
mens
rea
requirement
in
there,
it
cannot
effectively
be
done
because
of
this
or
because
of
that
and
then
the
court
would
have
a
legislative
basis
for
the
elimination
or
the
failure
to
put
a
mens
rea
requirement
in
there.
and
i
see
nothing
in
statutory
history
along
this
line.
mr.
luke
mckissack
on
the
constitutional
level?
well,
frankly
you
know
we
have
a
dearth
of
authority
as
this
court
said
in
the
powell
case.
the
court
has
not
laid
out
it
--
a
definitive
doctrine
of
mens
rea
and
all
we
have
is
the
all
more
old
morissette
case
to
go
from.
mr.
luke
mckissack
pardon
me?
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
well
the
dotterweich
case
of
course
involves
only
a
misdemeanor
really.
we’re
talking
about
there
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
on
a
corporate
officer
and
i
think
there
the
decision
is
the
majority
that
court
felt
or
the
court
might
feel
that,
to
use,
i
think
he
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
phrase
about
“we’re
living
an
age
where
the
consumer
is
made
unwary
of
certain
conditions
of
modern
industrial.”
i
can
see
why
and
certain
regulatory
statutes
why
you
might
--
where
a
person
is
in
a
business
let’s
say
if
dealing
with
certain
items
that
he
might
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
seek
out
the
law
pertaining
to
that
and
know
the
rule
and
regulations.
and
i
think
that's
the
case
there.
and
again
i
think
the
maximum
penalty
was
one
year
in
that
case.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
could,
i
think
it
will
be
for
this
court
to
say
one
way
or
the
other.
as
far
as
i
know
it’s
never
been
ruled
upon
but
i
think
if
we
do
not
limit
morissette
to
its
particular
facts
in
saying
that
the
crime
there
was
of
common
law
origin
or
a
composition
of
certain
common
law
of
crimes.
but
it
strike
from
it
the
basic
proposition
that
we’re
talking
about
its
potentially
serious
crime
that
there
should
be
mens
rea
requirement.
i
think
that
would
limit
itself
to
the
conclusion
that
the
gravity
of
the
crime
should
perhaps
way
some
role.
i
think
we’re
always
dealing
with
the
balancing
of
interest
and
you
might
say
to
the
person
who
parks
overtime
in
his
own
that
perhaps
he
was
even
unconscious
of
the
time
he
did
it.
he
should
have
to
pay
a
penalty
of
the
fine,
but
i
think
if
we’re
talking
about
putting
somebody
in
prison
for
a
period
of
time
it’s
got
to
be
some
affirmative
obligation
shown
by
congress
is
to
why
they
should
not
be
some
kind
of
criminal
culpability
or
corrupt
mind
or
some
kind
of
mens
rea
that
is
historically
been
accepted
and
as
a
part
of
this
culture
because
otherwise
then
we
run
in
to
the
problem
suggested
by
the
text
writers
that
if
the
laws
do
not
reflect
the
general
more
outlook
of
the
society
there's
an
extent
to
--
some
extent
they're
going
to
crumble.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i
would
necessarily
say
that
even
though
that's
i
think
attainable
proposition
but
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
they
would
have
to
justify
it.
i
think
they
would
have
to
say
that
i
think
constitutionally
they
could
but
if
we’re
talking
about
eliminating
scienter,
i
think
that
congress
would
have
to
make
a
finding
for
that
scienter
would
be
such
a
detriment
to
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
i
think
thinking
along
that
lines
would
be
permissible
and
if
they
said
we
got
a
lot
of
killings
in
the
streets
and
weapons
are
going
to
do
this
and
that
and
if
we
have
a
scienter
requirement
they’ll
be
able
to
dodge
here
and
there.
then
as
i
can
see
there's
an
acceptable
proposition
but
without
that
kind
of
finding
i
think
this
court
should
require
that
mens
rea
be
present
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
of
course
the
easiest
thing
would
be
make
a
construction
of
the
statute
because
then
the
congress
has
the
option
of
making
a
change
and
the
court
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
pardon
me?
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
the
court
would
have
to
in
that
particular
proposition
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
adopt
the
kind
of
thinking
that’s
been
reflected
in
some
of
other
members
of
the
court
about
using
the
due
process
clause
and
the
vague
contours.
i
don’t
think
he
could
spring
necessarily
from
the
kind
of
you
that
you
take
of
the
constitution.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
wouldn’t
expect
that
we
would
get
your
vote
on
that
kind
of
an
analysis
reaching
that
kind
of
a
result.
now,
if
i
may
return
to
the
self-incrimination
argument.
i
think
here
that
the
appellant
ignores
the
number
of
things;
i
think
you
were
talking
really
about
potential
self-incrimination.
i
don’t
think
this
is
been
analyzed
really
in
the
buie
case
or
minor
or
any
of
them
to
the
fullest
extent.
we’re
talking
here
about
the
appellant
says
that
there's
no
way
in
the
world
that
the
transferee
in
this
case
can
incriminate
himself.
we
claim
that
the
transferor
is
being
used
as
a
conduit
to
do
that.
they
say
he
can
incriminate
himself
because
after
the
application
is
turned
in
with
all
of
these
germane
material
about
name
and
address
and
fingerprints,
photograph
etcetera
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
i
don’t
know
if
he
has
an
illegal
background
will
read
california
law
i
presume
in
all
of
its
decisions
and
tell
him
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
run
afoul
of
it
and
if
he
does
so,
he
will
receive
a
letter
and
therefore
knowing
it’s
unlawful
he
won't
do
anything.
and
therefore,
compliance
with
the
statute
will
not
require
him
to
incriminate
himself.
now,
my
objection
to
that
is
that
all
of
these
that
he
has
to
do
before
he
reach
that
stage
is
highly
incriminatory
and
attempting
to
comply
with
the
statute
and
filling
out
all
of
these
information
and
lodging
as
in
the
registry
and
making
this
information
available.
he
makes
it
quite
clear
that
he
is
a
person
who
would
very
much
like
to
possess
a
hand
grenade.
perhaps,
illegally
if
not
legally
and
the
person
who
may
well
be
in
possession
of
other
hand
grenades
and
i
would
then
borrow
from
the
futuristic
analysis
of
the
marchetti
case
that
there
we
have
an
assumption
really
that
we’re
not
just
talking
about
law-abiding
people.
we
may
have
individuals
and
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
i’ve
reached
the
self-incrimination
argument
and
i
was
saying
that
i
think
that
more
is
required
of
the
transferee
here
and
would
be
the
party
we’d
be
concern
about
let’s
say
the
minor
case
or
some
others.
now,
i
mentioned
also
the
question
of
statutory
regulations
that
were
used
to
embroider
the
statute.
they
were
quite
exacting
in
so
far
as
the
transferee
is
concerned.
i’d
like
to
refer
to
a
couple
of
them.
referring
now
to
title
26
of
code
of
federal
regulations
179.99
and
this
is
the
one
where
the
individual
himself
as
to
attach
a
copy
of
his
photograph
made
within
a
year,
affix
to
his
fingerprints
to
this
application
where
he
is
saying
i
want
to
take
charge
of
hand
grenades
indicating
he’s
ready,
willing
and
able.
they
got
to
be
clear
etcetera
and
then
this
application
has
to
be
authenticated
by
local
chief
of
police
or
the
sheriff,
united
states
attorney,
united
states
marshal
or
anybody
acceptable
to
the
director
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
tax
division
saying
that
the
fingerprints
or
the
photographs
are
correct
and
so
forth.
now,
if
you
take
this
in
conjunction
with
another
section
which
is
178.98
which
talks
about
the
delivery
or
sale
and
it’s
prohibited
unless
the
person
to
receive
such
device
or
firearms
furnishes
the
likes
and
see
a
sworn
statement
in
triplicate
setting
forth:
(a)
the
reasons
why
there
is
a
reasonable
necessity
for
such
person
to
purchase
or
otherwise
inquire
the
device
or
weapon
and
(b)
that
such
person’s
receipt
or
possession
of
the
device
or
weapon
would
be
consistent
with
public
safety.
such
sworn
statement
shall
be
attached
to
the
application
to
transfer
and
register
the
firearm
required
by
part
179
of
this
chapter.
the
sale
or
delivery
of
the
device
shall
not
be
made
until
after
the
application
is
approved
etcetera.
in
other
words,
all
these
things
take
place
before
the
director
it
makes
the
ultimate
determination
as
to
whether
he
thinks
it’s
lawful
and
whether
the
transfer
is
going
to
be
approved.
so,
i
think
then
we
have
the
kind
of
situation
envisioned
by
as
much
of
the
language
in
marchetti
decision
or
we’re
not
just
talking
about
confession
of
past
crimes.
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
who
said
something
about
the
fact
that
a
person
may
confess
before
the
act
is
evidence
to
maybe
or
the
act
is
done.
and
then
we’re
not
talking
just
about
totally
in
the
fifth
amendment
area
--
the
protection
of
necessarily
innocent
people
and
we’re
talking
about
society
making
a
judgment
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
place
off
limits.
as
a
criminal
investigative
team,
a
defendant
presumably
his
lawyer
and
in
some
jurisdiction
perhaps
his
wife
and
i
don’t
think
that’s
unreasonable
and
i
think
by
doing
that
we
not
only
preserve
domestic
tranquility,
the
legal
process
to
the
presence
of
the
attorney
and
also
the
sanctity
individual,
that's
all
we’re
talking
about.
he’s
using
the
individual
--
not
using
the
individual
as
his
own
accuser
and
in
marchetti,
the
court
has
mentioned
that
we’re
protecting
the
imprudent
as
well
as
the
innocent
in
the
foresighted.
i
think
therefore
if
we
put
all
these
together
and
you
got
the
fingerprints,
the
photographs,
the
affidavit
as
to
why
you
should
have
it
etcetera
and
all
of
these
stuff
is
transferred
then
merely
it
say
that
subsequently
someone
makes
a
decision
that
is
unlawful
for
him
to
have
it.
it
doesn’t
mean
that
there's
no
self-incrimination
problem.
in
fact,
as
the
government
concedes
on
page
6
of
its
jurisdictional
statement
of
facts
something
the
effect
that
it’s
true
that
the
regulations
involved
the
potential
transferee
more
deeply
in
the
application
process
than
was
the
case
in
minor.
i
think
it’s
quite
deeply
involved
and
of
course
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
question
of
future
acts.
the
appellants
suggest
that
there
is
an
immunity
provision
that
they
feel
is
sufficiently
pervasive
to
justify
the
legislations
so
that
we
have
no
objections
to
it.
however,
they
were
only
talking
about
these
items
that
run
the
registry
not
being
used
to
prove
past
crimes
or
contemporaneous
crimes.
crime
contemporaneous
for
the
filing
i
assume.
now
there
are
some
other
problems
too
but
basically
i
would
assert
that
certainly
the
information
that
the
immunity
provision
does
not
prevent
this
information
from
being
made
available
to
numerous
people.
let’s
say
here’s
a
person
who
obviously
wants
to
get
hand
grenades
and
they
get
them
illegally
and
tell
other
things
about
it
etcetera.
this
is
available
and
it
also
raises
the
problem
which
mr.
justice
harlan
asserted
in
a
couple
of
the
grosso
and
aims
decisions
or
marchetti
about
we
were
being
embroiled
in
a
state
taint
hearing.
if
we’re
talking
about
a
violation
of
state
law
in
summiting
in
witnesses
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
information
had
been
passed
down
by
the
officials
and
of
course
this
can
lead
to
--
this
is
a
difficult
problem
to
wrestle
with.
i
think
that
all
of
these
things
together
mean
nothing
more
the
fact
that
the
transferee
is
saying,
“i
do.
i
am
willing
to
receive
hand
grenades
and
thus,
point
the
finger
of
suspicion
at
himself.”
they’re
dealing
with
a
highly
dangerous
object
that
indeed
he
would
like
to
possess
it
and
perhaps
even
illegally
if
not
legally.
this
law
in
summary
attempts
to
make
a
transfer
of
weapons
lawful
but
even
if
it’s
determined
to
be
unlawful
as
i
say,
the
transferee
incriminates
himself.
the
appellants
have
suggested
that
when
we
have
a
lawful
procedure
has
been
the
concession
that
a
number
of
people
apparently
have
registered
these
items
to
put
on
their
medals
or
whatever
they
do
with
them,
maybe
make
war
films
i
don’t
know.
but
still
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
fact
that
we
have
all
these
destructive
weapons
added
together
that
it
is
basically
still
a
criminal
statute
is
an
attempt
and
try
to
isolate
individuals
that
they
think
are
violative
of
law
and
use
a
tax
statute
for
that
kind
of
purpose.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
if
there
are
other
statutes
they
would
make
the
possession
a
fissionable
material
unlawful
per
se
then
i
would
think
that
we
would
have
a
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes
situation.
i
think
that
he
can’t
have
two
co-existing
statutes
whether
on
the
state
or
federal
level
for
one
punishes
raw
possession
and
the
other
demands
that
the
possessor
register
or
make
a
clear
that
he
wants
to
possess
it.
i
think
that’s
the
evil
(voice
overlap).
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i’ll
be
quite
honest
with
you.
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
act
but
it’s
possible
that
if
it’s
constructed
along
those
lines,
it
would
have
an
infirmity.
perhaps
for
me
evil,
perhaps
not
but
i
think
that's
the
guts
of
the
whole
case
is
that
i
don’t
know
why
congress
can't
simply
if
he
wants
to
--
if
we’re
talking
about
preserving
the
right
of
congress.
he
could
probably
pass
a
statute
against
possession
as
far
as
that’s
going
to
set
up
certain
exemptions
like
states
do,
like
law
enforcement
people
or
people
who
fight
fires
and
whoever
needs
these
various
items
can
have
them
or
if
you're
a
collector
and
you
come
in
and
prove
it
that's
alright.
but
i
think
that
to
just
require
that
they
registered
and
make
every
individual
who
touches
the
many
way
lawful
or
unlawful
come
forth.
in
the
form
of
the
written
declaration
or
in
person
is
the
kind
of
evil
that
those
cases
are
designed
to
prevent.
i
therefore
feel
that
the
haynes
problems
have
not
been
overcome
in
this
legislation
and
so
the
trial
court
held.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that’s
it.
mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
begin
by
referring
to
just
a
few
moments
to
an
issue
that
we
raised
when
the
appellants
sought
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
we
suggested
at
that
time
that
perhaps
this
court
do
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
i
just
like
to
make
couple
of
comments
along
that
line.
we
suggest
that
an
examination
of
the
appendix
which
contains
the
colloquy
in
the
trial
court
between
the
judge
and
attorney
etcetera
will
indicate
that
the
judges’
decision
was
quite
highbred
and
was
based
upon
a
number
of
considerations
that
it’s
replete
with
notion
that
the
judge
felt
that
in
as
much
as
the
bill
of
particulars
inform
the
court
that
what
actually
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
los
angeles
police
department
officer
apparently
and
conjunction
with
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
people
of
the
federal
government
had
gone
to
the
long
beach
arsenal
and
picked
up
a
hand
grenade
and
he
himself
had
sought
no
exemption
which
is
available
to
him
and
it
deliberately
flouted
the
law
and
did
not
obey
the
law.
and
only
by
his
action
that
he
caused
the
transferees
to
become
criminals
of
criminal
at
all,
he
suggested
that
this
might
amount
to
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
merely
say
that’s
not
to
say
that
necessarily
this
was
even
the
correct
decision
even
though
it
would
appear
that
he
was
following
the
line
of
thinking
of
the
concurring
justices
in
the
sorrel
and
sherman
thinking.
basically,
that
society
really
has
no
interest
in
trying
to
transform
inchoate
criminals
and
actual
ones.
but
whether
or
not,
this
is
a
correct
interpretation
to
this
court
would
follow
it
today,
i
think
it
does
recognize
the
fact
that
the
judge
was
thinking
along
that
line.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
but
what
we’re
talking
--
well,
because
the
conduct
of
the
police
officer
creates
the
crime
without
which
there
would
be
no
crime.
mr.
luke
mckissack
if
he
complied
with
the
law
the
transferee
would’ve
not
committed
the
crime,
that's
correct.
mr.
luke
mckissack
in
other
words,
the
police
officer
by
violating
the
law
and
created
the
criminal
that
is
the
transferee.
had
the
police
officer
done
what
the
law
required,
the
transferee
would
not
been
a
criminal.
only
because
of
the
activities
of
the
police
officer
did
the
transferee
become
a
criminal
and
this
was
the
thinking
expressed
by
the
court.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
statutory
history,
or
one
way
or
the
other
the
appellants
concede
for
example
that
it’s
entirely
silent
and
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
much
discussion
at
all
other
than
the
fact
that
if
you
like,
they
like
to
get
around
the
haynes
decision
in
passing
the
legislation.
i
don’t
know
--
there's
nothing
in
their
suggesting
that
the
transferee
should
have
any
affirmative
burden.
i
know
nothing
in
the
legislative
hearings
to
say
that
and
there's
no
basis
for
really
assuming
that
he
has
any
kind
of
a
burden.
as
i
say
the
statute
is
entirely
silent,
but
i'm
saying
in
this
case
that
we’re
not
talking
about
prosecution
under
state
charge,
we’re
not
talking
about
using
the
commerce
clause
which
perhaps
the
congress
could
to
make
just
raw
possession
a
crime.
we’re
talking
about
something
that’s
a
crime
only
because
the
transferee
takes
possession
of
something
which
the
transferor
has
failed
to
do
and
in
this
case
the
transferor
is
an
agent
of
the
government
and
acts
knowingly.
and
the
judge
did
considerable
thinking
along
that
lines
and
i
would
suggest
that
an
examination
of
his
thinking
would
show
that
perhaps
it
would
put
this
case
outside
the
legitimacy
of
the
appeal
and
i
would
merely
add
to
that
that
we’re
not
just
talking
about
interpretation
of
federal
statutes
here.
but
for
those
dissenters
in
the
mirsky
decision
that
we
have
involved
the
number
of
integral
treasury
regulations.
some
of
them
which
preexisted
the
haynes
decision
and
haven’t
even
been
altered
in
a
couple
of
them
which
don’t
even
make
the
change
between
transferee
and
transferor
and
there
are
some
interpretation
of
the
treasury
regulations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
the
self-incrimination
material
which
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute
is
found
in
its
treasury
regulations
rather
than
in
the
official
statutes.
because
the
statutes
will
say
that
the
transferor
must
do
certain
things
to
have
the
weapon
registered
and
the
transferee
must
do
certain
things
which
must
be
specified
by
the
secretary
of
treasury,
his
authorized
delegate.
and
then
in
certain
of
this
sections
178.9
(a)
etcetera
it
explains
that
there
has
to
be
--
there's
an
affirmative
obligation
of
the
transferee
to
get
a
photograph
of
himself
which
is
no
more
than
one-year-old
and
plaster
that
on
the
application.
he
has
to
put
his
fingerprints
on
there,
it
has
to
be
an
identification
in
the
serial
number
of
the
weapon
etcetera
and
all
of
these
things
then
there
has
to
be
an
approval
by
a
sheriff
or
a
police
official
or
someone
who
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
finds
it
suitable
to
verify
that
this
is
his
photograph
and
this
is
his
identification
and
it’s
going
to
be
use
lawfully.
and
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i
don’t
think
that
only
goes
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
terms
of
what
you
actually
have
to
do,
but
if
you
take
the
raw
activity
of
something
let’s
say
we
have
no
fifth
amendment,
nothing
testimonial
about
say
a
fingerprint
or
the
handwriting
is
similar.
the
majority
of
the
court
is
disposed
to
that
opinion.
but
if
you
take
that
material
and
you
require
the
person
to
lay
that
information
on
top
of
something
which
amounts
to
an
attestation
that
he
is
seeking
to
take
possession
of
hand
grenades
which
would
then
amount
to
perhaps
the
conspiracy
to
violate
california
law
or
maybe
even
an
attempt.
and
that
the
very
minimum
a
furnish
that
link
in
the
chain
that
this
man
maybe
a
person
who’s
desirous
of
buying
hand
grenades
and
if
the
authorization
doesn’t
go
through
you
go
ahead
and
purchase
at
any
house
so
they
can
key
on
his
house
or
on
his
business.
i
suggest
this
is
highly
incriminatory,
i
don’t
think
it
can
be
simply
head
noted
by
just
calling
it
a
fingerprint
case
or
a
photograph.
i
think
it’s
the
totality
of
the
context
and
when
these
things
appear
and
in
fact
there
has
to
be
a
witness
to
it
which
is
a
witness
for
the
government
who’s
standing
ready
to
testify
in
a
state
proceeding
against
the
man
who
does
these
things.
i
think
when
it’s
put
in
the
context
of
saying
i'm
going
to
take
possession
of
hand
grenade
that
certainly
has
a
testimonial
character
and
this
would
be
our
position.
but
just
to
sum
up
this
point
because
i
want
to
move
on
to
the
others
i
think
there
is
a
serious
question
on
two
grounds
as
to
whether
this
court
should
or
can
retain
jurisdiction.
a
probable
jurisdiction
has
been
noted
but
there
is
the
question
of
to
what
extent
the
judge
realizing
the
treasury
regulations
as
opposed
to
the
statutes
for
those
justices
who
think
that’s
important.
and
secondly,
there's
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
more
than
just
a
determination
of
self-incrimination
or
scienter
with
an
investigation
of
the
facts
and
rightfully
or
wrongfully
a
determination
by
judge
ferguson
that
this
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
if
i
may
in
reversal
to
go
perhaps
to
the
issue
of
scienter.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
an
allegation
of
any
kind
of
knowledge
here
and
the
judge
of
the
trial
level
found
that
as
we
see
the
indictment
neither
the
statute
nor
the
indictment
requires
any
kind
of
scienter.
not
even
the
most
minimal
kind,
not
even
that
congress
says
that
the
transferee
knows
that
he
has
something
and
knows
what
he
has,
that
is
its
characteristics,
because
its
hand
grenade
or
whatever
firearm.
much
less
does
it
allege
that
he
knows
that
it
was
unregistered
at
the
time
of
its
receipt
and
none
of
these
are
alleged
and
if
you
would
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
we’re
talking
only
about
count
two
of
the
indictment
at
that
point,
yes
sir.
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes
it
does
just
through
the
--
i
have
a
quarrel
with
count
one
of
the
indictment
or
another
for
another
reason
but
at
that
point,
no.
count
two
we’re
talking
about,
there's
no
kind
of
scienter
or
whatsoever.
now,
the
government
below
conceded
the
government
here
conceded
that
the
scienter
had
to
be
proved.
so
the
question
is,
does
the
indictment
have
to
obtain
and
have
to
spell
out
some
kind
of
scienter
requirement.
and
although
this
would
not
be
perhaps
the
place
to
reinvestigate
the
whole
function
of
the
grand
jury
system
etcetera,
i
assume
that
the
--
as
the
statute
was
laid
out,
it
was
laid
out
to
the
grand
jurors
and
even
they
in
passing
prima
facie
on
some
kind
of
responsibility
that
would
justify
taking
the
man
to
trial
would
not
or
have
knowledge
apparently
that
the
transferee
was
suppose
to
know
what
he
had
and
all
the
character
what
he
had.
so
we
don’t
know
anything
about
the
findings
here.
secondly,
as
i
say
there
is
a
string
of
cases
saying
that
the
indictment
has
to
allege
this
and
it
can't
be
cured
by
bill
of
particulars
as
the
old
caryll
case
which
i
referred
to
where
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
allege
the
necessary
scienter
requirement
that
renders
it
fatal
and
i
will
suggest
that
on
that
ground
that
the
indictment
in
this
case
is
deficient.
not
only
that
i
feel
that
the
statute
is
deficient
because
it
doesn’t
have
any
allegation
of
even
that
general
kind
of
knowledge.
there
is
in
the
government’s
brief
footnote
9
on
page
14,
the
suggestion
that
perhaps
a
statute
without
any
kind
of
scienter
could
reach
ridiculous
results
and
they
point
that
out.
they
suggest
the
remedy
is
that
if
you
have
a
noble
prosecutor
that
he
won't
prosecute
and
the
same
question
was
argued
again
before
judge
ferguson
and
he
seem
to
feel
that
there
should
be
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
and
this
was
an
adequate
answer
and
consequently
at
page
38
of
the
appendix,
they
insist
that
the
government
must
allege
scienter.
now,
i
also
make
the
argument
that
regarding
count
one,
if
we
take
the
reigning
law
in
this
country
that
when
we
have
the
conspiracy
to
violate
a
particular
statute
that
it
requires
a
more
of
an
intent
than
in
a
substantive
crime
and
we
definitely
involve
knowledge
of
the
law
in
an
attempt
to
run
afoul
of
the
law
and
there
are
string
of
cases
that
are
cited
state
cases
and
federal
cases.
indicating
if
that’s
the
case
at
least
in
so
far
as
mowlem
prohibit
to
more
public
welfare
crimes
are
concerned.
i
don’t
think
that
either
one
of
those
terms
are
too
helpful
in
trying
to
decide
on
whether
the
--
there
had
been
many
--
much
dispute
and
many
text
writers
who
have
had
argument
as
to
what
fits
in
their
category.
but
some
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
for
example
to
refer
to
the
mann
act,
white
slavery,
allegations
of
fraud
and
things
of
that
sort.
they
are
generically
different
and
say
perhaps
the
possession
of
firearms
in
this
case
in
terms
of
perhaps
the
gravity
of
the
action.
and
nevertheless
the
conspiracy
must
embrace
an
intent
to
run
afoul
of
the
law
and
that
is
not
alleged
and
that
was
another
one
of
the
grounds
which
the
trial
court
used
for
dismissing
the
indictment.
now,
on
the
issue
of
the
allegation
of
scienter
in
so
far
as
the
unregistered
character
of
the
firearm
is
concerned
that
it’s
our
contention
that
this
is
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
although
we
cite
the
lambert
decision,
we
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
as
having
totally
rely
upon
that.
there's
no
question
that
simplest
term
is
an
example
of
where
the
court
has
decided
all
things
considered
that
ignorance
of
the
law
must
be
an
excuse
--
the
majority
of
the
court
so
held.
but
here,
we
really
not
even
talking
about
ignorance
of
the
law,
we’re
talking
if
anything
about
one
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
let
me
distinguish
two
situations
where
crime
involved
here.
in
other
words,
the
defense
is
not
that
the
defendants
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
law
saying
that
you
could
not
possess
a
firearm
unless
it
was
registered.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
one
of
the
elements
which
should
be
pled
and
proved
is
that
the
defendants
took
possession
of
firearm
knowing
that
the
transferor
had
not
had
it
registered
and
there's
a
world
of
difference
because
as
the
one
case
we’re
talking
about
just
not
knowing
what
the
law
is
and
the
person
is
presumed
to
know
the
law.
here,
we’re
talking
about
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
that
brings
the
legal
proposition
into
play
and
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
is
the
characterization
of
the
weapon
being
taken
and
that
characterization
is
that
it
is
of
unregistered
character.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
scienter
requirements
should
reach
this
far
and
the
question
of
analysis
of
what
kind
of
scienter
this
court
should
decide
the
statute
intended
to
contain
or
it’s
a
matter
of
due
process.
i’ve
gone
to
the
various
authorities
of
analyze
the
whole
notion
of
mens
rea,
history
etcetera
and
i'm
disposed
to
think
that
perhaps
the
court
should
reevaluate
the
whole
area
and
i
have
sort
of
find
of
sayers
test
when
he
talks
about
the
fact
that
when
we
get
to
a
crime
that’s
sufficiently
grave.
that
is
clear
as
just
not
a
regulatory
measure.
we
were
trying
to
single
out
raw
and
wrongdoers
for
criminal
treatment
which
was
expressed
in
the
law
before
haynes.
it
have
been
re-expressed
that
they’re
trying
to
do
away
with
people
who
are
engaged
in
wrongful
acts
and
have
even
expanded
the
number
of
weapons
to
cover
rockets
and
missiles
and
things
like
this
which
are
not
normally
possessed
by
people
just
for
hobbies.
and
secondly,
where
the
imprisonment
is
too
grave
to
allow
the
deletion
of
mens
rea
as
he
puts
it.
i
think
the
court
should
at
that
point
intercede
and
require
a
stronger
scienter
requirement
or
in
the
absence
of
any
legislative
finding
that
is
not
required,
the
court
should
assume
that
it
should
be
there
based
upon
the
common
law
history
and
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
now,
this
crime
is
count
two
for
example
carries
a
penalty
about
to
10
years
or
$10,000.00.
formally,
it
was
five
years
or
$5,000.00.
the
court
might
wish
borrow
by
analogy
from
its
decisions
in
the
area
of
where
they
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
evaluating
the
potential
length
of
sentence
or
the
actual
sentence
or
its
decisions
in
the
question
of
right
to
counsel
is
to
whether
you
may
be
have
a
right
to
counsel
for
a
traffic
ticket
or
as
opposed
to
say
a
felony
or
major
felony
or
major
misdemeanor
and
i
think
perhaps
some
of
the
same
considerations
that
go
into
making
a
decision
is
to
whether
it’s
significant
enough
to
attach
the
right
to
counsel
to
insist
on
the
right
to
jury
might
also
be
implemented
here
in
deciding
whether
or
not
we
can
have
a
strict
liability
statute
or
in
effect
punish
somebody
for
a
crime
is
not
meant
to
be
a
crime
unless
we
are
possessing
an
unregistered
firearm
and
say
that
the
person
doesn’t
have
to
have
knowledge
of
it.
again,
i
repeat
i
know
nothing
in
the
statutory
history
that
causes
a
person
to
have
to
seek
out,
and
finally
whether
or
not
the
weapon
has
been
registered.
it
has
been
suggested
by
the
appellant
in
his
brief
that
if
you're
dealing
with
firearms
or
you're
dealing
with
hand
grenades
you
must
know
that
there
some
kind
of
requirement
that
they
be
treated
this
way.
i
subject
that
this
is
--
suggest
that
this
is
just
a
matter
of
speculation.
if
i
were
taking
a
possession
of
a
firearm
or
hand
grenade
i
might
think
a
number
of
things.
one
thing
i
might
think
is,
this
is
just
totally
illegal
and
i
better
not
get
caught
with
it.
a
second
thing
i
might
think
is
that
perhaps
it’s
illegal
but
it
may
not
be
illegal
to
possess
but
i’d
better
be
careful
what
i
do
with
it
and
if
put
on
the
mantelpiece
it’s
okay.
thirdly,
i
might
to
think
that
perhaps
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
permit
in
order
to
get
it.
fourthly,
i
might
think
that
it’s
alright
for
me
to
take
possession
of
it
but
after
i
do
so
i
better
report
it
to
someone
and
register
it.
and
if
a
person
was
guilty
for
example
of
quite
reasonable
kind
of
thinking
the
fourth
type
that
certainly
you
would
have
to
have
a
statute
which
would
allow
reasonable
period
of
time
to
register
the
weapon
and
as
the
appellant
candidly
concedes.
once
the
purpose
takes
possession
of
it
that
is
the
crime
and
there’s
nothing
on
earth
that
he
can
do
to
make
himself
law-abiding
thereafter.
so,
i
just
think
the
fact
that
we’re
dealing
with
hand
grenades
should
not
cause
the
court
to
feel
like
a
strong
mens
rea
requirement
should
not
be
exacted
when
we’re
talking
about
a
very
severe
crime
with
a
great
deal
of
gravity.
mr.
luke
mckissack
that’s
a
tricky
question
and
i
suggest
i
have
some
thoughts
on
it
but
on
either
basis
i
think
the
court
might
say
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
but
if
it
chooses
not
to
put
on
that
basis,
i
think
it
would
be
a
reasonable
statement
to
say
that
when
we’re
talking
about
this
kind
of
crime
with
this
kind
of
penalty
that
congress
should
have
the
affirmative
obligation
of
making
a
quite
express
as
to
whether
they
feel
they
want
strict
liability
or
whether
they're
going
to
eliminate
the
mens
rea
requirement
rather
than
to
rely
upon
the
position
of
the
appellant
which
is
because
it’s
not
spelled
out
in
the
statute
that
congress
never
intended
to
be
there.
i
don’t
see
anything
inherently
unfair
or
imprudent
about
asking
congress
to
do
that
given
the
huge
common
law
background
and
given
the
gravity
of
the
offense
and
all
of
the
statements
to
the
effect
that
mens
rea
in
grave
crimes
does
play
a
great
role
in
our
jurisprudence
and
i
see
no
great
imposition
on
congress.
they
can
hold
hearings.
it
would
be
very
simple
to
pass
a
statute
and
say,
that
we
find
based
upon
in
information
that
only
way
we
can
control
these
weapons
or
get
them
properly
taxed
is
to
do
such
and
such
and
if
we
put
the
mens
rea
requirement
in
there,
it
cannot
effectively
be
done
because
of
this
or
because
of
that
and
then
the
court
would
have
a
legislative
basis
for
the
elimination
or
the
failure
to
put
a
mens
rea
requirement
in
there.
and
i
see
nothing
in
statutory
history
along
this
line.
mr.
luke
mckissack
on
the
constitutional
level?
well,
frankly
you
know
we
have
a
dearth
of
authority
as
this
court
said
in
the
powell
case.
the
court
has
not
laid
out
it
--
a
definitive
doctrine
of
mens
rea
and
all
we
have
is
the
all
more
old
morissette
case
to
go
from.
mr.
luke
mckissack
pardon
me?
mr.
luke
mckissack
yes,
well
the
dotterweich
case
of
course
involves
only
a
misdemeanor
really.
we’re
talking
about
there
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
on
a
corporate
officer
and
i
think
there
the
decision
is
the
majority
that
court
felt
or
the
court
might
feel
that,
to
use,
i
think
he
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
phrase
about
“we’re
living
an
age
where
the
consumer
is
made
unwary
of
certain
conditions
of
modern
industrial.”
i
can
see
why
and
certain
regulatory
statutes
why
you
might
--
where
a
person
is
in
a
business
let’s
say
if
dealing
with
certain
items
that
he
might
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
seek
out
the
law
pertaining
to
that
and
know
the
rule
and
regulations.
and
i
think
that's
the
case
there.
and
again
i
think
the
maximum
penalty
was
one
year
in
that
case.
mr.
luke
mckissack
it
could,
i
think
it
will
be
for
this
court
to
say
one
way
or
the
other.
as
far
as
i
know
it’s
never
been
ruled
upon
but
i
think
if
we
do
not
limit
morissette
to
its
particular
facts
in
saying
that
the
crime
there
was
of
common
law
origin
or
a
composition
of
certain
common
law
of
crimes.
but
it
strike
from
it
the
basic
proposition
that
we’re
talking
about
its
potentially
serious
crime
that
there
should
be
mens
rea
requirement.
i
think
that
would
limit
itself
to
the
conclusion
that
the
gravity
of
the
crime
should
perhaps
way
some
role.
i
think
we’re
always
dealing
with
the
balancing
of
interest
and
you
might
say
to
the
person
who
parks
overtime
in
his
own
that
perhaps
he
was
even
unconscious
of
the
time
he
did
it.
he
should
have
to
pay
a
penalty
of
the
fine,
but
i
think
if
we’re
talking
about
putting
somebody
in
prison
for
a
period
of
time
it’s
got
to
be
some
affirmative
obligation
shown
by
congress
is
to
why
they
should
not
be
some
kind
of
criminal
culpability
or
corrupt
mind
or
some
kind
of
mens
rea
that
is
historically
been
accepted
and
as
a
part
of
this
culture
because
otherwise
then
we
run
in
to
the
problem
suggested
by
the
text
writers
that
if
the
laws
do
not
reflect
the
general
more
outlook
of
the
society
there's
an
extent
to
--
some
extent
they're
going
to
crumble.
mr.
luke
mckissack
no,
i
would
necessarily
say
that
even
though
that's
i
think
attainable
proposition
but
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
they
would
have
to
justify
it.
i
think
they
would
have
to
say
that
i
think
constitutionally
they
could
but
if
we’re
talking
about
eliminating
scienter,
i
think
that
congress
would
have
to
make
a
finding
for
that
scienter
would
be
such
a
detriment
to
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
i
think
thinking
along
that
lines
would
be
permissible
and
if
they
said
we
got
a
lot
of
killings
in
the
streets
and
weapons
are
going
to
do
this
and
that
and
if
we
have
a
scienter
requirement
they’ll
be
able
to
dodge
here
and
there.
then
as
i
can
see
there's
an
acceptable
proposition
but
without
that
kind
of
finding
i
think
this
court
should
require
that
mens
rea
be
present
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
of
course
the
easiest
thing
would
be
make
a
construction
of
the
statute
because
then
the
congress
has
the
option
of
making
a
change
and
the
court
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
luke
mckissack
pardon
me?
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
the
court
would
have
to
in
that
particular
proposition
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
adopt
the
kind
of
thinking
that’s
been
reflected
in
some
of
other
members
of
the
court
about
using
the
due
process
clause
and
the
vague
contours.
i
don’t
think
he
could
spring
necessarily
from
the
kind
of
you
that
you
take
of
the
constitution.
mr.
luke
mckissack
i
wouldn’t
expect
that
we
would
get
your
vote
on
that
kind
of
an
analysis
reaching
that
kind
of
a
result.
now,
if
i
may
return
to
the
self-incrimination
argument.
i
think
here
that
the
appellant
ignores
the
number
of
things;
i
think
you
were
talking
really
about
potential
self-incrimination.
i
don’t
think
this
is
been
analyzed
really
in
the
buie
case
or
minor
or
any
of
them
to
the
fullest
extent.
we’re
talking
here
about
the
appellant
says
that
there's
no
way
in
the
world
that
the
transferee
in
this
case
can
incriminate
himself.
we
claim
that
the
transferor
is
being
used
as
a
conduit
to
do
that.
they
say
he
can
incriminate
himself
because
after
the
application
is
turned
in
with
all
of
these
germane
material
about
name
and
address
and
fingerprints,
photograph
etcetera
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
i
don’t
know
if
he
has
an
illegal
background
will
read
california
law
i
presume
in
all
of
its
decisions
and
tell
him
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
run
afoul
of
it
and
if
he
does
so,
he
will
receive
a
letter
and
therefore
knowing
it’s
unlawful
he
won't
do
anything.
and
therefore,
compliance
with
the
statute
will
not
require
him
to
incriminate
himself.
now,
my
objection
to
that
is
that
all
of
these
that
he
has
to
do
before
he
reach
that
stage
is
highly
incriminatory
and
attempting
to
comply
with
the
statute
and
filling
out
all
of
these
information
and
lodging
as
in
the
registry
and
making
this
information
available.
he
makes
it
quite
clear
that
he
is
a
person
who
would
very
much
like
to
possess
a
hand
grenade.
perhaps,
illegally
if
not
legally
and
the
person
who
may
well
be
in
possession
of
other
hand
grenades
and
i
would
then
borrow
from
the
futuristic
analysis
of
the
marchetti
case
that
there
we
have
an
assumption
really
that
we’re
not
just
talking
about
law-abiding
people.
we
may
have
individuals
and
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
luke
mckissack
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
i’ve
reached
the
self-incrimination
argument
and
i
was
saying
that
i
think
that
more
is
required
of
the
transferee
here
and
would
be
the
party
we’d
be
concern
about
let’s
say
the
minor
case
or
some
others.
now,
i
mentioned
also
the
question
of
statutory
regulations
that
were
used
to
embroider
the
statute.
they
were
quite
exacting
in
so
far
as
the
transferee
is
concerned.
i’d
like
to
refer
to
a
couple
of
them.
referring
now
to
title
26
of
code
of
federal
regulations
179.99
and
this
is
the
one
where
the
individual
himself
as
to
attach
a
copy
of
his
photograph
made
within
a
year,
affix
to
his
fingerprints
to
this
application
where
he
is
saying
i
want
to
take
charge
of
hand
grenades
indicating
he’s
ready,
willing
and
able.
they
got
to
be
clear
etcetera
and
then
this
application
has
to
be
authenticated
by
local
chief
of
police
or
the
sheriff,
united
states
attorney,
united
states
marshal
or
anybody
acceptable
to
the
director
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
tax
division
saying
that
the
fingerprints
or
the
photographs
are
correct
and
so
forth.
now,
if
you
take
this
in
conjunction
with
another
section
which
is
178.98
which
talks
about
the
delivery
or
sale
and
it’s
prohibited
unless
the
person
to
receive
such
device
or
firearms
furnishes
the
likes
and
see
a
sworn
statement
in
triplicate
setting
forth:
(a)
the
reasons
why
there
is
a
reasonable
necessity
for
such
person
to
purchase
or
otherwise
inquire
the
device
or
weapon
and
(b)
that
such
person’s
receipt
or
possession
of
the
device
or
weapon
would
be
consistent
with
public
safety.
such
sworn
statement
shall
be
attached
to
the
application
to
transfer
and
register
the
firearm
required
by
part
179
of
this
chapter.
the
sale
or
delivery
of
the
device
shall
not
be
made
until
after
the
application
is
approved
etcetera.
in
other
words,
all
these
things
take
place
before
the
director
it
makes
the
ultimate
determination
as
to
whether
he
thinks
it’s
lawful
and
whether
the
transfer
is
going
to
be
approved.
so,
i
think
then
we
have
the
kind
of
situation
envisioned
by
as
much
of
the
language
in
marchetti
decision
or
we’re
not
just
talking
about
confession
of
past
crimes.
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
who
said
something
about
the
fact
that
a
person
may
confess
before
the
act
is
evidence
to
maybe
or
the
act
is
done.
and
then
we’re
not
talking
just
about
totally
in
the
fifth
amendment
area
--
the
protection
of
necessarily
innocent
people
and
we’re
talking
about
society
making
a
judgment
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
place
off
limits.
as
a
criminal
investigative
team,
a
defendant
presumably
his
lawyer
and
in
some
jurisdiction
perhaps
his
wife
and
i
don’t
think
that’s
unreasonable
and
i
think
by
doing
that
we
not
only
preserve
domestic
tranquility,
the
legal
process
to
the
presence
of
the
attorney
and
also
the
sanctity
individual,
that's
all
we’re
talking
about.
he’s
using
the
individual
--
not
using
the
individual
as
his
own
accuser
and
in
marchetti,
the
court
has
mentioned
that
we’re
protecting
the
imprudent
as
well
as
the
innocent
in
the
foresighted.
i
think
therefore
if
we
put
all
these
together
and
you
got
the
fingerprints,
the
photographs,
the
affidavit
as
to
why
you
should
have
it
etcetera
and
all
of
these
stuff
is
transferred
then
merely
it
say
that
subsequently
someone
makes
a
decision
that
is
unlawful
for
him
to
have
it.
it
doesn’t
mean
that
there's
no
self-incrimination
problem.
in
fact,
as
the
government
concedes
on
page
6
of
its
jurisdictional
statement
of
facts
something
the
effect
that
it’s
true
that
the
regulations
involved
the
potential
transferee
more
deeply
in
the
application
process
than
was
the
case
in
minor.
i
think
it’s
quite
deeply
involved
and
of
course
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
question
of
future
acts.
the
appellants
suggest
that
there
is
an
immunity
provision
that
they
feel
is
sufficiently
pervasive
to
justify
the
legislations
so
that
we
have
no
objections
to
it.
however,
they
were
only
talking
about
these
items
that
run
the
registry
not
being
used
to
prove
past
crimes
or
contemporaneous
crimes.
crime
contemporaneous
for
the
filing
i
assume.
now
there
are
some
other
problems
too
but
basically
i
would
assert
that
certainly
the
information
that
the
immunity
provision
does
not
prevent
this
information
from
being
made
available
to
numerous
people.
let’s
say
here’s
a
person
who
obviously
wants
to
get
hand
grenades
and
they
get
them
illegally
and
tell
other
things
about
it
etcetera.
this
is
available
and
it
also
raises
the
problem
which
mr.
justice
harlan
asserted
in
a
couple
of
the
grosso
and
aims
decisions
or
marchetti
about
we
were
being
embroiled
in
a
state
taint
hearing.
if
we’re
talking
about
a
violation
of
state
law
in
summiting
in
witnesses
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
information
had
been
passed
down
by
the
officials
and
of
course
this
can
lead
to
--
this
is
a
difficult
problem
to
wrestle
with.
i
think
that
all
of
these
things
together
mean
nothing
more
the
fact
that
the
transferee
is
saying,
“i
do.
i
am
willing
to
receive
hand
grenades
and
thus,
point
the
finger
of
suspicion
at
himself.”
they’re
dealing
with
a
highly
dangerous
object
that
indeed
he
would
like
to
possess
it
and
perhaps
even
illegally
if
not
legally.
this
law
in
summary
attempts
to
make
a
transfer
of
weapons
lawful
but
even
if
it’s
determined
to
be
unlawful
as
i
say,
the
transferee
incriminates
himself.
the
appellants
have
suggested
that
when
we
have
a
lawful
procedure
has
been
the
concession
that
a
number
of
people
apparently
have
registered
these
items
to
put
on
their
medals
or
whatever
they
do
with
them,
maybe
make
war
films
i
don’t
know.
but
still
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
fact
that
we
have
all
these
destructive
weapons
added
together
that
it
is
basically
still
a
criminal
statute
is
an
attempt
and
try
to
isolate
individuals
that
they
think
are
violative
of
law
and
use
a
tax
statute
for
that
kind
of
purpose.
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
if
there
are
other
statutes
they
would
make
the
possession
a
fissionable
material
unlawful
per
se
then
i
would
think
that
we
would
have
a
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes
situation.
i
think
that
he
can’t
have
two
co-existing
statutes
whether
on
the
state
or
federal
level
for
one
punishes
raw
possession
and
the
other
demands
that
the
possessor
register
or
make
a
clear
that
he
wants
to
possess
it.
i
think
that’s
the
evil
(voice
overlap).
mr.
luke
mckissack
well,
i’ll
be
quite
honest
with
you.
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
act
but
it’s
possible
that
if
it’s
constructed
along
those
lines,
it
would
have
an
infirmity.
perhaps
for
me
evil,
perhaps
not
but
i
think
that's
the
guts
of
the
whole
case
is
that
i
don’t
know
why
congress
can't
simply
if
he
wants
to
--
if
we’re
talking
about
preserving
the
right
of
congress.
he
could
probably
pass
a
statute
against
possession
as
far
as
that’s
going
to
set
up
certain
exemptions
like
states
do,
like
law
enforcement
people
or
people
who
fight
fires
and
whoever
needs
these
various
items
can
have
them
or
if
you're
a
collector
and
you
come
in
and
prove
it
that's
alright.
but
i
think
that
to
just
require
that
they
registered
and
make
every
individual
who
touches
the
many
way
lawful
or
unlawful
come
forth.
in
the
form
of
the
written
declaration
or
in
person
is
the
kind
of
evil
that
those
cases
are
designed
to
prevent.
i
therefore
feel
that
the
haynes
problems
have
not
been
overcome
in
this
legislation
and
so
the
trial
court
held.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that’s
it.
