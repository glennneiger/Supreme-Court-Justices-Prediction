mr.
frank
g.
raichle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
unusual
antitrust
case.
its
genesis
is
this,
a
man
by
the
name
of
hornaday
who
worked
for
king
which
is
a
division
of
hearst,
so
when
counsel
refers
to
king,
he
is
referring
to
hearst,
hearst
newspaper.
hornaday
left
king
for
hearst
and
went
to
work
for
another
smaller
syndicate
selling
color
comic
supplement
printing,
and
while
he
had
a
little
initial
success
he
soon
encountered
the
effects
of
the
tie-ins
of
hearst
with
its
features
and
its
printing.
hearst
would
tell
him
to
come
up,
you
aren’t
going
to
have
your
printing
done
through
us,
while
you
have
to
pay
more
for
your
features,
typical
violation.
so,
hornaday
began
to
complain
about
hearst.
in
fact,
he
complained
about
the
things
he
used
to
do
while
he
was
with
hearst.
and
so
the
government
got
busy,
and
started
investigation
of
the
industry
at
the
instance
of
hornaday
who
had
not
complained
about
us
in
any
way
and
in
the
course
of
events,
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
which
resulted
in
the
no
bills,
i
recall
it,
and
subsequently,
the
commencement
of
this
suit
in
the
year
1961.
and
a
strange
course
of
events
at
least
to
me
a
strange
course
of
events
ensued.
the
original
argument
trial
counsel
for
the
government
told
the
court
that
the
action
was
brought
primarily
against
hearst
to
stop
hearst
from
its
tie
end
practices.
indeed,
it
was
brought
for
our
protection
and
find
that
off
repeated
in
the
record,
a
strange
kind
of
protection
in
the
light
of
the
relief
by
way
of
divestiture
of
our
sylacauga
plant
that
sought
in
the
complaint.
well,
in
any
event,
greater
buffalo
if
i
might
take
just
a
minute
to
describe
it,
had
a
very
inauspicious
and
amble
beginning
back
in
1926,
the
kessler
family,
walter
kessler
who
was
a
reporter
on
the
newspaper
went
into
business
for
himself
but
members
of
his
family
assisting
him
with
an
investment
of
a
$1000
to
$3,000.00,
they
put
up
a
little
printing
press
right
in
their
own
home.
members
of
the
family
worked
and
they
printed
a
little
neighborhood
newspaper.
and
i
guess
they
were
helped
by
the
depression
in
the
30’s
because
it
began
to
print
these
mortgage
foreclosures
and
happenings,
and
legal
notices
in
connection
with
bankruptcies
and
so
forth.
and
they
began
to
print
a
few
adds
for
the
local
stores
and
started
to
print
colored
adds,
and
sometime
in
the
30’s,
one
of
the
buffalo
papers
suggested
to
him
that
they
might
be
able
to
print
a
comic
section.
furnish
them
with
an
old
press,
they
started
to
print.
from
that
the
start
they
to
print
for
the
2927
newspaper
and
then
from
that
chicago
paper
and
the
thing
grew,
that’s
one
of
the
typical
american
success
stories
of
its
kind.
so,
as
the
year
1950,
51,
52,
53
year
all
around,
buffalo
press
by
some
innovations
of
walter
kessler,
its
president,
some
ingenuity
on
the
part
of
all
of
the
hard
work
on
the
part
of
the
whole
family
had
succeeded
in
developing
quite
a
business
in
this
color
comic
supplement
field.
and
they
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
king
tie-in.
king
had
the
major
features,
not
only
comic
features
but
the
syndication
of
the
columnist
popular
of
the
day.
and
the
competition
between
greater
buffalo
and
hearst
as
i
put
it,
king
if
you
please,
was
intense,
there's
no
question
about
it.
we
didn’t
conceive
it,
we
were
competing
with
international
which
printed
exclusively
for
hearst.
strange
thing
about
it
to
me
has
always
been,
and
i’ll
say
more
about
that
when
we
talk
about
the
absence
of
barriers
to
entry
in
this
field.
international
never
printed
for
the
hearst
papers,
they
always
printed
their
own,
whole
country.
the
hearst
papers
print
their
own
comics.
while
in
any
event,
in
1951,
52,
53,
red
buffalo
press
build
a
plant
on
lufkin,
texas
to
accommodate
the
self
to
the
transportation
charges
more
beneficial
to
its
costumers
in
that
area
and
began
the
plant,
in
fact,
at
an
earlier
date
began
to
plan
for
a
plant
in
sylacauga,
alabama
and
it's
that
plant
with
which
we’re
particularly
concerned
and
there’s
more
or
less
unmentioned
by
my
opponents.
i’ll
have
to
get
to
that
in
a
few
minutes.
by
then,
in
any
event,
the
owners
of
the
international,
a
golden
family
by
name
who
lived,
i
think
one
of
them
lived
in
cuba
and
one
of
them
in
alabama
and
refused
to
make
any
investment
in
the
company
after
the
original
investment
and
were
contempt
to
let
this
man
gorman,
a
very
competent
operator
who
run
the
plant
for
him.
and
now
i
don’t
suppose,
i
could
say
with
candor
to
the
court
that
by
1955,
international
squared
with
your
decisions,
definitions
of
a
failing
company
but
if
it
wasn’t
a
failing
company
then,
it
was
destined
to
become
one
whatever
artificial
difference
-–
making
that
observation.
its
working
capital
was
impaired,
its
machinery
was
obsolete
and
getting
worst,
its
only
costumer
king
was
threatening
to
take
the
business
away
and
put
it
somewhere
else
and
in
an
answer
to
the
inquiry
from
the
bench,
the
first
business
of
the
king
that
greater
buffalo
got
was
in
the
year
1954,
when
the
run
from
youngstown
toledo
and
i
think
erie
pennsylvania
was
transferred
to
it
by
knight
and
of
hearst.
in
the
extreme,
as
in
which
international
found
itself,
it
sought
to
sell
the
plant,
the
business
if
you
could
call
that
to
hearst.
the
opportunities
were
made,
insistent
opportunities
were
made
to
hearst
to
buy
it
and
the
answer
was
hearst
wasn’t
interested
in
it
at
any
price
and
refused
to.
mr.
gorman
testified
on
the
trial
that
he
knew
of
no
other
purchaser
so
he
offered
it
to
mr.
kessler
of
greater
buffalo
press,
kessler
bought
it
for
$575,000.00
back
in
1955.
along
was
antitrust
litigation
that
is
ensued
since.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
international
was
engaged
in
negotiations
looking
toward
a
long
term
contract.
those
negotiations
had
not
ripened
into
a
contract
and
at
the
time
that
greater
buffalo
bought
it
on
june
25,
1955,
it
had
no
contract
assurance
of
business
and
it
took
a
calculated
business
risk.
but
was
the
equivalent
of
some
obsolete
machinery
which
it
hoped
to
modernize
with
its
own
techniques
and
make
efficient.
well,
there
is
an
element
to
the
case
which
i
don’t
think
from
which
i
think
i
should
talk
about
for
just
a
moment.
after
greater
buffalo
build
its
lufkin
plant
or
the
lufkin
plant
became
a
reality
and
knight
learned
of
it
and
about
the
time,
the
purchase
of
the
international
plant,
knight
began
to
put
pressure
on
kessler,
so
as
tie-ins.
in
other
words,
that
he
wanted
to
become
or
wanted
hearst
to
become
the
exclusive
sales
agent
for
greater
buffalo
press
and
that
greater
buffalo
press
should
print
only
for
international
and
there’s
extensive
correspondence
on
that
subject
in
the
record.
and
i
would
characterize
it
as
a
flirtation
on
the
part
of
the
parties
looking
toward
a
lineup
where
and
whereby
hearst
would
be
the
seller,
king
would
be
the
seller
and
greater
buffalo
would
be
the
printer.
and
it
went
on
over
a
period
two
or
three
years
and
accounts
for
some
of
the
documents
in
the
record
which
had
first
flushed
somewhat
embarrassing,
i
think
the
king
and
greater
buffalo.
but
in
the
course
of
events,
kessler
was
advised
and
knight
was
advised
that
any
such
arrangement
--
as
knight
was
proposing
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
antitrust
law,
that
was
abandoned.
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
the
abandonment
of
their
plant.
well,
greater
buffalo
went
ahead
and
build
the
sylacauga
plant,
five
years
after
this
acquisition
and
that’s
what
they
wanted
divested.
now,
i
don’t
care
at
the
moment
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
discussion
whether
you
take
the
relevant
market
as
that
which
the
court
found
or
the
relevant
market
as
counsel
contends
that
it
should
be
considered.
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
no
barriers,
the
interesting
thing,
people
--
newspapers
for
whom
we
have
printed
and
whom
we
thought
we
have
so
that
because
of
our
wanted
efficiency
have
gone
back
to
printing
their
own.
i
think
i
can
say
without
fear
of
serious
dispute,
certainly
not
effective
dispute,
that
most
any
newspaper
in
this
country
can
print
its
own
and
that
there
is
great
access
capacity
in
this
country
for
the
printing
of
these
comic
color
supplements.
your
honors
know
from
your
daily
reading,
most
evening
paper
you
pick
up
prints
colored
ads
for
stores
or
automobile
companies,
dress
designers
and
whatever
and
it
takes
very
little
adaptation
to
put
those
presses
to
work,
to
print
the
colored
comic
supplement.
now,
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
governance
exhibit
show
that
certain
newspapers
print
for
others,
that’s
other
newspapers.
exhibit
--
i
think
on
page
1823
of
the
record
is
something
that’s
printed
at
page
14
of
my
brief,
the
red
one.
it
shows
that
hearst,
the
hearst
papers
in
chicago
prints
for
two
non-hearst
papers,
one
in
chicago
and
one
in
pittsburg.
the
same
exhibit
shows
that
hearst
plants
have
a
surplus
capacity
for
the
printing
of
12,504
page
sections
incidentally,
that’s
the
unit
of
production,
i
was
talking
about.
mr.
frank
g.
raichle
its
page
14
of
our
brief
and
its
page
1823
of
the
record.
mr.
frank
g.
raichle
1823
your
honor,
of
the
appendix,
as
of
the
record,
i
mean
the
appendix
of
course.
now
then,
i
say
that
the
competitive
effects,
if
any
were
minimal
and
immediately
dispelled
long
since
dissipated.
i
don’t
have
time
but
let
me
cite
one
example.
the
principal
competitor
of
greater
buffalo
press
runs
head
on
to
greater
buffalo
press
and
at
sylacauga
plant,
the
southern
colored
print.
it's
an
undisputed
fact
clear
as
a
(inaudible)
in
the
records
that
between
the
time
that
we
acquired
international
and
the
time
of
the
trial
that
southern
color
which
incidentally
is
hornadey's
company,
the
man
who
started
all
of
this
stuff
has
gone
from
477,714
four
page
sections
per
week
to
3,400,000
per
week.
that
during
the
same
period
of
time
translated
in
the
dollars,
it's
gone
from
a
$600,000.00
volume
to
$3,300,000.00.
it’s
an
established
fact
that
every
printing
company
that
is
a
factor
in
this
industry
or
was
a
factor
in
1955
at
that
time
of
our
acquisition
has
an
increase
in
its
business
and
it
is
an
undisputed
fact
that
most
of
the
increase
of
the
business
came
from
us
and
that
we
took
no
compensating
business
from
them.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
divestiture
and
introduce
your
honors
to
that
subject
and
i
know
that
this
historic
courtroom,
this
court
has
heard
many
strange
contentions
that
i
have
asked
this
one
or
i
call
attention
to
one
advance
by
my
friends
as
one
of
the
strangest
that
i’ve
ever
heard
and
perhaps
if
you
--
now
they
say
that
this
violation,
this
purchase
of
this
old
machinery
back
in
1955
took
with
it
the
planning
which
international
had
for
a
plant
at
sylacauga,
alabama.
and
at
page
37
of
their
brief
they
say
effective
relief
in
this
case
which
would
create
a
viable
independent
color
comic
supplement
printer
capable
of
providing
king
with
an
ultimate
source
of
printing
from
greater
buffalo
requires
divestiture
of
all
the
assets
owned
by
international
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
and
the
sylacauga,
alabama
plant
planned
by
international
but
constructed
and
operated
after
the
acquisition
by
dixie
color
printing
company
and
the
buffalo
subsidiary,
dixie
color
is
the
company
who
owns
a
title
to
the
building
which
we
built.
now,
that’s
cumulative
to
the
effect
that
intended
beneficiary
of
the
requested
divestiture
is
hearst.
now,
in
our
early
days
of
this
case
i
repeat,
we
were
described
as
the
victim
and
hearst
was
described
as
the
predator.
this
is
the
first
time,
i
ever
heard
a
government
counsel
seek
the
divestiture
from
the
victim
for
the
benefit
of
the
predator.
now,
let
me
give
you
the
history
of
the
building
of
the
sylacauga
plant.
right
it,
two
or
three
people
hid
upon
sylacauga,
might
sound
like
a
strange
coincidence,
not
at
all.
there’s
something
called
the
coosa
river
paper
company
down
there
and
as
early
as
1950,
coosa
river
paper
company
had
called
the
greater
buffalo
to
see
if
they
could
build
a
plant
for
us
if
we
would
take
their
product
and
use
it
in
our
printing.
well,
at
that
time,
we
were
engrossed
in
going
forth
with
lufkin
and
we
didn’t
pursue
it
seriously,
although
we
made
some
investigation.
indeed,
that’s
five
years
before
the
acquisition,
back
in
1947
which
was
eight
years
before
the
acquisition,
we
had
planned
a
plant
in
the
deep
south.
and
in
1950,
we
had
in
writing
which
is
a
exhibit
in
this
record,
committed
ourselves
to
atlanta
paper,
i
forgot
the
name
of
it
to
build
the
plant.
we
did
specify
at
sylacauga
but
we
said
in
the
deep
south
probably
in
alabama.
well,
it
seems
that
the
district
coosa
river
contacting
printers
generally
to
see
if
they
could
get
someone
to
build
a
plant,
also
contacted
international.
and
that
international
had
at
least
in
the
minds
of
gorman,
that
operating
head
had
planned
to
pursue
the
subject
on
its
own.
well,
he
went
to
hearst,
hearst
wouldn’t
give
them
a
long
term
contract
at
the
price
that
will
permit
the
investment
and
a
new
plant
hearst
as
i
said
wouldn’t
buy
the
international
plant.
hearst
wouldn’t
do
a
thing
to
promote
the
development
of
a
plant
in
sylacauga.
now,
after
--
not
before
but
after
the
acquisition,
we
built
the
plant,
completed
it
five
years
later.
well,
this
i
say
in
all
confidence.
the
government’s
brief
says
that
we
changed
some
details
and
furnished
some
things,
details,
but
we
built
the
plant
in
accordance
with
the
same
plans
which
we
have
used
some
years
before
in
lufkin.
it
is
a
reproduction
of
our
lufkin
plant.
we
went
to
baltimore
and
bought
a
press.
i
heard
the
competitor
bought
the
other
available
press
from
the
same
newspaper.
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
baltimore
newspaper.
the
press
was
worked
on
transiently
--
and
the
international
employees.
this
was
after
the
acquisition.
but
we
reimbursed
them
for
all
the
work.
the
plant
was
built
to
install
the
press.
the
press
was
installed.
no
equipment
of
consequence
came
from
wilkes
barre.
the
only
equipment
that
did
come
was
a
little
office
furniture
and
i
think
one
color
duplicator
or
something.
we
have
the
inventories
in
evidence
as
worth
less
than
$350.00
in
the
aggregate
and
the
plant
cost
us
3
million
dollars.
now
he
says,
or
the
brief
says,
that
for
some
reason
or
other
we
should
divest
that
plant
so
that
hearst
could
buy
it.
preposterous,
i
say
your
honors.
now
in
continuing
because
that’s
what
the
case
is
all
about
apparently.
did
we
build
a
plant
for
any
business
form
hearst?
no.
74%
of
the
color
comic
supplement
printing
which
is
done
in
that
plant
is
by
contracts
made
with
greater
buffalo
and
not
international
directly
with
newspaper.
they
didn't
afford
to
print
it
their
own.
now,
30%
of
the
business
down
there
is
what
we
call
commercial
printing
subject
to
which
we
have
not
alluded.
that
means
advertising
for
a
chain
stores,
sears
roebuck,
montgomery
ward,
safeway
stores
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
that
constitutes
30%
of
the
printing
being
done
in
that
plant.
and
if
you
give
up
in
fact
to
30%,
then
84%
of
the
printing
down
there
is
ours.
and
i
think
some
--
that
is
from
contracts
of
ours
and
minimal
amount
came
from
wilkes
barre
or
from
international.
now,
one
or
more
things.
this
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
a
printer
out
of
hearst
or
out
of
king,
is
so
in
congress
because
time
and
again,
the
evidence
showed
and
it’s
undisputed
that
is
a
matter
of
policy
hearst
would
not
enter
the
printing.
option
saving
a
statement
by
hearst
senior
officer
that
i
get
it
right.
this
sums
up
the
case
from
hearst
point
of
view
what
the
government
is
trying
to
point
it.
mr.
green
who
is
mr.
knight
sr.
said
that
hearst
would
never
be
interested
in
printing.
then
he
cites
the
fact
that
(inaudible)
sold
50
million
gum
drafts
a
year
and
never
made
one
and
made
money
not
withstanding.
now,
i
just
don’t
know,
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
under
all
the
cases,
as
under
any
case
on
this
subject,
there
cannot
be
a
divestiture
for
equitable
reasons,
let
alone
those
associated
with
the
due
process.
now
if
he
wants
to
talk
about
a
divestiture
of
the
old
machinery,
we
bought
15
years
ago
up
in
wilkes
barre,
that
at
the
moment
is
idle.
i
think
all
the
arguments
i
am
advanced,
those
showing
that
there
were
no
anti-competitive
effects,
if
indeed
there
was
any
technical
violation,
easy
access
to
the
market,
the
passage
of
time,
the
development
and
the
growth
of
competition.
just
one
more
thing
is
probably
it
is
the
least
important.
merely
days
of
the
case,
the
unions
were
appearing,
amicus
here,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
urging
that
we
don’t
take
things
out
of
wilkes
barre
predicting
dire
consequences
to
the
economy
if
we
did.
why
the
economy
has
grown
largely
through
what
we
have
done
up
there
if
i
might
boast
about
it.
all
our
fears
have
gone
away.
senator
sparkman
was
coming
up
to
complain
that
if
we
didn’t
bring
things
down
to
sylacauga
after
we
started.
and
i
think
we
brought
prosperity
to
that
part
of
the
country,
would
buy
the
newsprint.
we
employ
people,
we
do
a
wholesome
business
and
i
think
it’s
wholesome
at
this
little
family
business
and
the
tradition
of
the
free
enterprise
could
flourish
as
it
has
and
do
so
well
and
violate
no
law.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
g.
raichle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
unusual
antitrust
case.
its
genesis
is
this,
a
man
by
the
name
of
hornaday
who
worked
for
king
which
is
a
division
of
hearst,
so
when
counsel
refers
to
king,
he
is
referring
to
hearst,
hearst
newspaper.
hornaday
left
king
for
hearst
and
went
to
work
for
another
smaller
syndicate
selling
color
comic
supplement
printing,
and
while
he
had
a
little
initial
success
he
soon
encountered
the
effects
of
the
tie-ins
of
hearst
with
its
features
and
its
printing.
hearst
would
tell
him
to
come
up,
you
aren’t
going
to
have
your
printing
done
through
us,
while
you
have
to
pay
more
for
your
features,
typical
violation.
so,
hornaday
began
to
complain
about
hearst.
in
fact,
he
complained
about
the
things
he
used
to
do
while
he
was
with
hearst.
and
so
the
government
got
busy,
and
started
investigation
of
the
industry
at
the
instance
of
hornaday
who
had
not
complained
about
us
in
any
way
and
in
the
course
of
events,
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
which
resulted
in
the
no
bills,
i
recall
it,
and
subsequently,
the
commencement
of
this
suit
in
the
year
1961.
and
a
strange
course
of
events
at
least
to
me
a
strange
course
of
events
ensued.
the
original
argument
trial
counsel
for
the
government
told
the
court
that
the
action
was
brought
primarily
against
hearst
to
stop
hearst
from
its
tie
end
practices.
indeed,
it
was
brought
for
our
protection
and
find
that
off
repeated
in
the
record,
a
strange
kind
of
protection
in
the
light
of
the
relief
by
way
of
divestiture
of
our
sylacauga
plant
that
sought
in
the
complaint.
well,
in
any
event,
greater
buffalo
if
i
might
take
just
a
minute
to
describe
it,
had
a
very
inauspicious
and
amble
beginning
back
in
1926,
the
kessler
family,
walter
kessler
who
was
a
reporter
on
the
newspaper
went
into
business
for
himself
but
members
of
his
family
assisting
him
with
an
investment
of
a
$1000
to
$3,000.00,
they
put
up
a
little
printing
press
right
in
their
own
home.
members
of
the
family
worked
and
they
printed
a
little
neighborhood
newspaper.
and
i
guess
they
were
helped
by
the
depression
in
the
30’s
because
it
began
to
print
these
mortgage
foreclosures
and
happenings,
and
legal
notices
in
connection
with
bankruptcies
and
so
forth.
and
they
began
to
print
a
few
adds
for
the
local
stores
and
started
to
print
colored
adds,
and
sometime
in
the
30’s,
one
of
the
buffalo
papers
suggested
to
him
that
they
might
be
able
to
print
a
comic
section.
furnish
them
with
an
old
press,
they
started
to
print.
from
that
the
start
they
to
print
for
the
2927
newspaper
and
then
from
that
chicago
paper
and
the
thing
grew,
that’s
one
of
the
typical
american
success
stories
of
its
kind.
so,
as
the
year
1950,
51,
52,
53
year
all
around,
buffalo
press
by
some
innovations
of
walter
kessler,
its
president,
some
ingenuity
on
the
part
of
all
of
the
hard
work
on
the
part
of
the
whole
family
had
succeeded
in
developing
quite
a
business
in
this
color
comic
supplement
field.
and
they
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
king
tie-in.
king
had
the
major
features,
not
only
comic
features
but
the
syndication
of
the
columnist
popular
of
the
day.
and
the
competition
between
greater
buffalo
and
hearst
as
i
put
it,
king
if
you
please,
was
intense,
there's
no
question
about
it.
we
didn’t
conceive
it,
we
were
competing
with
international
which
printed
exclusively
for
hearst.
strange
thing
about
it
to
me
has
always
been,
and
i’ll
say
more
about
that
when
we
talk
about
the
absence
of
barriers
to
entry
in
this
field.
international
never
printed
for
the
hearst
papers,
they
always
printed
their
own,
whole
country.
the
hearst
papers
print
their
own
comics.
while
in
any
event,
in
1951,
52,
53,
red
buffalo
press
build
a
plant
on
lufkin,
texas
to
accommodate
the
self
to
the
transportation
charges
more
beneficial
to
its
costumers
in
that
area
and
began
the
plant,
in
fact,
at
an
earlier
date
began
to
plan
for
a
plant
in
sylacauga,
alabama
and
it's
that
plant
with
which
we’re
particularly
concerned
and
there’s
more
or
less
unmentioned
by
my
opponents.
i’ll
have
to
get
to
that
in
a
few
minutes.
by
then,
in
any
event,
the
owners
of
the
international,
a
golden
family
by
name
who
lived,
i
think
one
of
them
lived
in
cuba
and
one
of
them
in
alabama
and
refused
to
make
any
investment
in
the
company
after
the
original
investment
and
were
contempt
to
let
this
man
gorman,
a
very
competent
operator
who
run
the
plant
for
him.
and
now
i
don’t
suppose,
i
could
say
with
candor
to
the
court
that
by
1955,
international
squared
with
your
decisions,
definitions
of
a
failing
company
but
if
it
wasn’t
a
failing
company
then,
it
was
destined
to
become
one
whatever
artificial
difference
-–
making
that
observation.
its
working
capital
was
impaired,
its
machinery
was
obsolete
and
getting
worst,
its
only
costumer
king
was
threatening
to
take
the
business
away
and
put
it
somewhere
else
and
in
an
answer
to
the
inquiry
from
the
bench,
the
first
business
of
the
king
that
greater
buffalo
got
was
in
the
year
1954,
when
the
run
from
youngstown
toledo
and
i
think
erie
pennsylvania
was
transferred
to
it
by
knight
and
of
hearst.
in
the
extreme,
as
in
which
international
found
itself,
it
sought
to
sell
the
plant,
the
business
if
you
could
call
that
to
hearst.
the
opportunities
were
made,
insistent
opportunities
were
made
to
hearst
to
buy
it
and
the
answer
was
hearst
wasn’t
interested
in
it
at
any
price
and
refused
to.
mr.
gorman
testified
on
the
trial
that
he
knew
of
no
other
purchaser
so
he
offered
it
to
mr.
kessler
of
greater
buffalo
press,
kessler
bought
it
for
$575,000.00
back
in
1955.
along
was
antitrust
litigation
that
is
ensued
since.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
purchase,
international
was
engaged
in
negotiations
looking
toward
a
long
term
contract.
those
negotiations
had
not
ripened
into
a
contract
and
at
the
time
that
greater
buffalo
bought
it
on
june
25,
1955,
it
had
no
contract
assurance
of
business
and
it
took
a
calculated
business
risk.
but
was
the
equivalent
of
some
obsolete
machinery
which
it
hoped
to
modernize
with
its
own
techniques
and
make
efficient.
well,
there
is
an
element
to
the
case
which
i
don’t
think
from
which
i
think
i
should
talk
about
for
just
a
moment.
after
greater
buffalo
build
its
lufkin
plant
or
the
lufkin
plant
became
a
reality
and
knight
learned
of
it
and
about
the
time,
the
purchase
of
the
international
plant,
knight
began
to
put
pressure
on
kessler,
so
as
tie-ins.
in
other
words,
that
he
wanted
to
become
or
wanted
hearst
to
become
the
exclusive
sales
agent
for
greater
buffalo
press
and
that
greater
buffalo
press
should
print
only
for
international
and
there’s
extensive
correspondence
on
that
subject
in
the
record.
and
i
would
characterize
it
as
a
flirtation
on
the
part
of
the
parties
looking
toward
a
lineup
where
and
whereby
hearst
would
be
the
seller,
king
would
be
the
seller
and
greater
buffalo
would
be
the
printer.
and
it
went
on
over
a
period
two
or
three
years
and
accounts
for
some
of
the
documents
in
the
record
which
had
first
flushed
somewhat
embarrassing,
i
think
the
king
and
greater
buffalo.
but
in
the
course
of
events,
kessler
was
advised
and
knight
was
advised
that
any
such
arrangement
--
as
knight
was
proposing
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
antitrust
law,
that
was
abandoned.
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
the
abandonment
of
their
plant.
well,
greater
buffalo
went
ahead
and
build
the
sylacauga
plant,
five
years
after
this
acquisition
and
that’s
what
they
wanted
divested.
now,
i
don’t
care
at
the
moment
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
discussion
whether
you
take
the
relevant
market
as
that
which
the
court
found
or
the
relevant
market
as
counsel
contends
that
it
should
be
considered.
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
no
barriers,
the
interesting
thing,
people
--
newspapers
for
whom
we
have
printed
and
whom
we
thought
we
have
so
that
because
of
our
wanted
efficiency
have
gone
back
to
printing
their
own.
i
think
i
can
say
without
fear
of
serious
dispute,
certainly
not
effective
dispute,
that
most
any
newspaper
in
this
country
can
print
its
own
and
that
there
is
great
access
capacity
in
this
country
for
the
printing
of
these
comic
color
supplements.
your
honors
know
from
your
daily
reading,
most
evening
paper
you
pick
up
prints
colored
ads
for
stores
or
automobile
companies,
dress
designers
and
whatever
and
it
takes
very
little
adaptation
to
put
those
presses
to
work,
to
print
the
colored
comic
supplement.
now,
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
governance
exhibit
show
that
certain
newspapers
print
for
others,
that’s
other
newspapers.
exhibit
--
i
think
on
page
1823
of
the
record
is
something
that’s
printed
at
page
14
of
my
brief,
the
red
one.
it
shows
that
hearst,
the
hearst
papers
in
chicago
prints
for
two
non-hearst
papers,
one
in
chicago
and
one
in
pittsburg.
the
same
exhibit
shows
that
hearst
plants
have
a
surplus
capacity
for
the
printing
of
12,504
page
sections
incidentally,
that’s
the
unit
of
production,
i
was
talking
about.
mr.
frank
g.
raichle

page

of
our
brief
and
its
page

of
the

mr.
frank
g.
raichle
1823
your
honor,
of
the
appendix,
as
of
the
record,
i
mean
the
appendix
of
course.
now
then,
i
say
that
the
competitive
effects,
if
any
were
minimal
and
immediately
dispelled
long
since
dissipated.
i
don’t
have
time
but
let
me
cite
one
example.
the
principal
competitor
of
greater
buffalo
press
runs
head
on
to
greater
buffalo
press
and
at
sylacauga
plant,
the
southern
colored
print.
it's
an
undisputed
fact
clear
as
a
(inaudible)
in
the
records
that
between
the
time
that
we
acquired
international
and
the
time
of
the
trial
that
southern
color
which
incidentally
is
hornadey's
company,
the
man
who
started
all
of
this
stuff
has
gone
from
477,714
four
page
sections
per
week
to
3,400,000
per
week.
that
during
the
same
period
of
time
translated
in
the
dollars,
it's
gone
from
a
$600,000.00
volume
to
$3,300,000.00.
it’s
an
established
fact
that
every
printing
company
that
is
a
factor
in
this
industry
or
was
a
factor
in
1955
at
that
time
of
our
acquisition
has
an
increase
in
its
business
and
it
is
an
undisputed
fact
that
most
of
the
increase
of
the
business
came
from
us
and
that
we
took
no
compensating
business
from
them.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
divestiture
and
introduce
your
honors
to
that
subject
and
i
know
that
this
historic
courtroom,
this
court
has
heard
many
strange
contentions
that
i
have
asked
this
one
or
i
call
attention
to
one
advance
by
my
friends
as
one
of
the
strangest
that
i’ve
ever
heard
and
perhaps
if
you
--
now
they
say
that
this
violation,
this
purchase
of
this
old
machinery
back
in
1955
took
with
it
the
planning
which
international
had
for
a
plant
at
sylacauga,
alabama.
and
at
page
37
of
their
brief
they
say
effective
relief
in
this
case
which
would
create
a
viable
independent
color
comic
supplement
printer
capable
of
providing
king
with
an
ultimate
source
of
printing
from
greater
buffalo
requires
divestiture
of
all
the
assets
owned
by
international
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
and
the
sylacauga,
alabama
plant
planned
by
international
but
constructed
and
operated
after
the
acquisition
by
dixie
color
printing
company
and
the
buffalo
subsidiary,
dixie
color
is
the
company
who
owns
a
title
to
the
building
which
we
built.
now,
that’s
cumulative
to
the
effect
that
intended
beneficiary
of
the
requested
divestiture
is
hearst.
now,
in
our
early
days
of
this
case
i
repeat,
we
were
described
as
the
victim
and
hearst
was
described
as
the
predator.
this
is
the
first
time,
i
ever
heard
a
government
counsel
seek
the
divestiture
from
the
victim
for
the
benefit
of
the
predator.
now,
let
me
give
you
the
history
of
the
building
of
the
sylacauga
plant.
right
it,
two
or
three
people
hid
upon
sylacauga,
might
sound
like
a
strange
coincidence,
not
at
all.
there’s
something
called
the
coosa
river
paper
company
down
there
and
as
early
as
1950,
coosa
river
paper
company
had
called
the
greater
buffalo
to
see
if
they
could
build
a
plant
for
us
if
we
would
take
their
product
and
use
it
in
our
printing.
well,
at
that
time,
we
were
engrossed
in
going
forth
with
lufkin
and
we
didn’t
pursue
it
seriously,
although
we
made
some
investigation.
indeed,
that’s
five
years
before
the
acquisition,
back
in
1947
which
was
eight
years
before
the
acquisition,
we
had
planned
a
plant
in
the
deep
south.
and
in
1950,
we
had
in
writing
which
is
a
exhibit
in
this
record,
committed
ourselves
to
atlanta
paper,
i
forgot
the
name
of
it
to
build
the
plant.
we
did
specify
at
sylacauga
but
we
said
in
the
deep
south
probably
in
alabama.
well,
it
seems
that
the
district
coosa
river
contacting
printers
generally
to
see
if
they
could
get
someone
to
build
a
plant,
also
contacted
international.
and
that
international
had
at
least
in
the
minds
of
gorman,
that
operating
head
had
planned
to
pursue
the
subject
on
its
own.
well,
he
went
to
hearst,
hearst
wouldn’t
give
them
a
long
term
contract
at
the
price
that
will
permit
the
investment
and
a
new
plant
hearst
as
i
said
wouldn’t
buy
the
international
plant.
hearst
wouldn’t
do
a
thing
to
promote
the
development
of
a
plant
in
sylacauga.
now,
after
--
not
before
but
after
the
acquisition,
we
built
the
plant,
completed
it
five
years
later.
well,
this
i
say
in
all
confidence.
the
government’s
brief
says
that
we
changed
some
details
and
furnished
some
things,
details,
but
we
built
the
plant
in
accordance
with
the
same
plans
which
we
have
used
some
years
before
in
lufkin.
it
is
a
reproduction
of
our
lufkin
plant.
we
went
to
baltimore
and
bought
a
press.
i
heard
the
competitor
bought
the
other
available
press
from
the
same
newspaper.
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
baltimore
newspaper.
the
press
was
worked
on
transiently
--
and
the
international
employees.
this
was
after
the
acquisition.
but
we
reimbursed
them
for
all
the
work.
the
plant
was
built
to
install
the
press.
the
press
was
installed.
no
equipment
of
consequence
came
from
wilkes
barre.
the
only
equipment
that
did
come
was
a
little
office
furniture
and
i
think
one
color
duplicator
or
something.
we
have
the
inventories
in
evidence
as
worth
less
than
$350.00
in
the
aggregate
and
the
plant
cost
us
3
million
dollars.
now
he
says,
or
the
brief
says,
that
for
some
reason
or
other
we
should
divest
that
plant
so
that
hearst
could
buy
it.
preposterous,
i
say
your
honors.
now
in
continuing
because
that’s
what
the
case
is
all
about
apparently.
did
we
build
a
plant
for
any
business
form
hearst?
no.
74%
of
the
color
comic
supplement
printing
which
is
done
in
that
plant
is
by
contracts
made
with
greater
buffalo
and
not
international
directly
with
newspaper.
they
didn't
afford
to
print
it
their
own.
now,
30%
of
the
business
down
there
is
what
we
call
commercial
printing
subject
to
which
we
have
not
alluded.
that
means
advertising
for
a
chain
stores,
sears
roebuck,
montgomery
ward,
safeway
stores
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
that
constitutes
30%
of
the
printing
being
done
in
that
plant.
and
if
you
give
up
in
fact
to
30%,
then
84%
of
the
printing
down
there
is
ours.
and
i
think
some
--
that
is
from
contracts
of
ours
and
minimal
amount
came
from
wilkes
barre
or
from
international.
now,
one
or
more
things.
this
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
a
printer
out
of
hearst
or
out
of
king,
is
so
in
congress
because
time
and
again,
the
evidence
showed
and
it’s
undisputed
that
is
a
matter
of
policy
hearst
would
not
enter
the
printing.
option
saving
a
statement
by
hearst
senior
officer
that
i
get
it
right.
this
sums
up
the
case
from
hearst
point
of
view
what
the
government
is
trying
to
point
it.
mr.
green
who
is
mr.
knight
sr.
said
that
hearst
would
never
be
interested
in
printing.
then
he
cites
the
fact
that
(inaudible)
sold
50
million
gum
drafts
a
year
and
never
made
one
and
made
money
not
withstanding.
now,
i
just
don’t
know,
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
under
all
the
cases,
as
under
any
case
on
this
subject,
there
cannot
be
a
divestiture
for
equitable
reasons,
let
alone
those
associated
with
the
due
process.
now
if
he
wants
to
talk
about
a
divestiture
of
the
old
machinery,
we
bought
15
years
ago
up
in
wilkes
barre,
that
at
the
moment
is
idle.
i
think
all
the
arguments
i
am
advanced,
those
showing
that
there
were
no
anti-competitive
effects,
if
indeed
there
was
any
technical
violation,
easy
access
to
the
market,
the
passage
of
time,
the
development
and
the
growth
of
competition.
just
one
more
thing
is
probably
it
is
the
least
important.
merely
days
of
the
case,
the
unions
were
appearing,
amicus
here,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
urging
that
we
don’t
take
things
out
of
wilkes
barre
predicting
dire
consequences
to
the
economy
if
we
did.
why
the
economy
has
grown
largely
through
what
we
have
done
up
there
if
i
might
boast
about
it.
all
our
fears
have
gone
away.
senator
sparkman
was
coming
up
to
complain
that
if
we
didn’t
bring
things
down
to
sylacauga
after
we
started.
and
i
think
we
brought
prosperity
to
that
part
of
the
country,
would
buy
the
newsprint.
we
employ
people,
we
do
a
wholesome
business
and
i
think
it’s
wholesome
at
this
little
family
business
and
the
tradition
of
the
free
enterprise
could
flourish
as
it
has
and
do
so
well
and
violate
no
law.
thank
you.
