mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
direct
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york,
brings
before
the
court
the
validity
of
a
1955
merger
between
the
two
leading
firms
engaged
in
the
printing
of
color
comic
supplements
for
newspapers.
the
appeal
presents
a
group
of
typical
section
7
questions,
the
definition
of
the
relevant
product
market,
the
question
whether
the
effect
of
the
merger
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition,
the
question
whether
the
acquired
company
was
a
failing
company
and
the
question
of
whether
divestiture
was
a
appropriate
relief.
there
are
three
principal
firms
involved
in
this
case
which
i
will
describe
briefly.the
acquiring
firm,
the
appellee
greater
buffalo
press,
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
had
a
plant
in
buffalo
and
also
a
plant
in
dunkirk,
new
york.
the
second
firm
is
the
acquired
company,
international
color
press.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
it
also
had
two
plants,
one
in
wilkes
barre,
pennsylvania
and
the
other
in
peoria,
illinois
but
the
peoria
plant
has
been
closed.
the
third
principal
actor
in
this
story
is
a
firm
called
king
syndicate,
that
is
a
division
of
the
hearst
corporation.
king
itself
is
not
a
printer.
it
is
engaged
in
syndication
of
copywrited
articles,
features,
comic
scripts,
cartoons,
two
newspapers.
what
king
does
is
engages
in
two
forms
of
activity.
first,
it
licenses
features
to
the
newspapers
and
secondly,
it
arranges
for
the
printing
of
those
comic
supplements
to
the
newspapers
that
wish
it.
the
government
complaint
which
was
filed
in
1961
challenged
not
only
the
merger
that
is
here
before
the
court
but
also
alleged
that
greater
buffalo,
hearst
through
king
and
another
syndicate
had
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
divide
costumers,
to
fix
prices
and
to
monopolize
the
printing
of
color
comic
supplements
alleged
that
king
and
the
other
newspaper
syndicate
had
also
engaged
in
illegal
tying
agreements
under
which
the
claim
was
that
the
licensing
of
the
comic
supplements
was
tied
to
the
dealing
with
the
syndicate
for
printing.
in
1965,
the
government
settled
a
case
against
hearst
through
the
entry
of
a
consent
judgment
under
which
there
were
various
prohibitions
upon
hearst
including
a
prohibition
upon
engaging
in
tying
agreements
although
the
judgment
at
that
--
that
judgment
does
not
preclude
king
from
quoting
a
single
price
for
features
and
printing
for
the
licensing
that
is
and
the
printing.
however,
that
judgment
also
contains
provisions
that
in
the
event
greater
buffalo
is
found
to
have
violated
any
provision
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
judgment
may
then
be
reopened.
the

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
10
years,
well,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
describe
about
the
chronology
of
it
and
explain
why.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
10
years
from
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
16
since
the
merger
filed,
let
me
--
if
i
may
explain
just
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
merger
took
place
in
1955,
two
or
three
years
thereafter,
an
employee
of
another
firm
made
a
complaint
to
the
department
of
justice
that
hearst
was
engaging
in
tie-ins.
following
this
complaint
and
some
preliminary
investigation,
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
in
buffalo,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
grand
jury,
the
government
decided
not
to
seek
an
indictment
but
instead
to
bring
a
civil
suit.
now,
the
original
complaint
did
not
relate
of
course
to
the
merger,
the
original
complaint
related
to
the
tie-ins
by
hearst
and
king
but
in
the
course
of
our
investigation,
we
developed
other
facts
including
the
fact
relating
to
the
merger
which
led
us
to
conclude
that
there
were
violations
in
addition
to
those
that
had
been
brought
to
our
attention.
now,
the
10
years
between
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed
and
the
case
comes
to
this
court
as
occupied
by
a
series
of
situations.
first,
two
or
three
years
were
occupied
by
the
government’s
first
successful
attempt
to
obtain
a
preliminary
injunction
against
greater,
the
transfer
of
certain
assets
in
the
wilkes
barre
plant
of
international
to
a
plant
that
had
been
built
down
in
sylacauga,
alabama.
following
that,
we
had
the
negotiations
over
the
consent
decree
which
led
to
the
consent
decree
against
hearst.
the
trial
actually
began
in
october
of
1965
and
of
course,
in
the
end
of
all,
i
might
add
that
after
we
had
gotten
the
preliminary
injunction,
then
there
were
further
proceedings
with
more
testimony
taken
on
a
motion
by
the
appellee
to
modify
the
injunction.
following
the
completion
of
the
government’s
case
in
october
of
1965,
in
1966
there
was
hearing
on
whether
the
government
had
established
a
prima
facia
case
and
a
year
and
a
half
elapsed
after
that
hearing
until
the
defendant’s
case
came
in.
the
defendant’s
case
came
in
in
the
summer
of
1967.
briefs
were
filed
about
a
year
thereafter.
closing
arguments
were
not
had
until
a
year
thereafter
which
was
in
december
of
1969.
now,
the
reason
for
all
these
delays
was
basically,
this
is
as
i
understand
it,
at
that
time
in
the
latter
part
of
the
1960’s,
there
was
only
one
judge
on
the
bench
in
baltimore,
that
was
judge
henderson
of
those
buffalo,
i’m
sorry,
buffalo.
after
a
successor
judge
was
appointed,
the
man
selected
for
the
post
was
the
united
states
attorney
and
as
a
result,
this
new
judge
was
not
qualified
to
hear
any
of
the
pending
criminal
cases.
and
since
criminal
cases
were
given
a
priority,
it
meant
that
judge
henderson
was
required
to
spend
the
major
part
of
his
time
in
this
period
on
trying
the
criminal
cases
and
just
had
to
work
this
case
in
as
he
could,
that
this
was
the
reason
for
the
delay.
i
don’t
think
that
the
delay
is
attributable
to
the
government
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it’s
an
unfortunate,
i
think
these
delays
in
these
cases
are
always
unfortunate,
i’m
afraid
this
was
just
one
of
those
circumstances,
we
tried
to
do
everything
we
could,
we
dropped
a
charge
of
violating
section
2,
a
monopolization
charge
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
expedite
the
thing,
we
did
everything
we
could
to
get
the
case
moving
because
i
think
just
one
of
those
unfortunate
things
where
the
judicial
process
sometimes
moves
slowly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
that’s
all
we
have
appealed
from,
is
the
court’s
dismissal
of
the
section
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
stated
explicitly
in
a
motion,
in
a
notice
we
filed
stating
that
we
were
dropping
the
monopolization
charges,
we
were
doing
so
for
the
purpose
of
expediting
trial
of
the
case.
that
is
set
forth
at
page
518
and
519
i
think
of
the
record,
that
was
the
reason.
now,
coming
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
most
sunday
newspapers
in
this
country
have
what
i
have
in
my
hand
a
typical
comic
color
supplements.
the
supplement
has
two
elements
to
it
basically,
a
newspaper
that
wants
a
supplement
has
to
get
two
things.
these
different
features
are
all
copyrighted
and
the
newspaper
has
to
get
a
license
for
these
features.
in
addition,
the
newspaper
has
to
arrange
to
have
the
supplement
printed
and
the
printing
of
comic
color
supplements
is
a
very
--
requires
special
skill,
it’s
not
something
that
can
be
done,
they’re
done
with
four
different
inks
and
it
takes
great
techniques
to
accomplish
this.
the
licenses
for
using
the
comic
color
comics
themselves
are
controlled
by
the
syndicates
and
the
syndicate’s
license
to
a
newspaper
as
many
of
these
particular
comics
as
they
want.
sometimes,
the
newspaper
will
get
all
of
its
particular
comics
from
a
single
syndicate
more
likely
it
will
be
a
combination
in
this
one
of
the
washington
post
shows
that
the
different
comics
come
from
half
a
dozen
or
more
syndicates.
now,
approximately
one
third
of
all
of
these
color
comic
supplements
are
printed
by
the
newspapers
themselves,
the
remaining
two
thirds
are
printed
by
the
so-called
comic
color
supplement
printers
which
the
two
merging
companies
were
the
two
leading
ones.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
and
even
to
this
day,
everyone
concedes
that
greater
buffalo
press
is
the
leader
in
the
comic
supplement
field,
it
is
the
most
skilled
one.
it
is
the
firm
that
can
produce
the
best
product.
both
of
these
firms
of
course
produced
the
same
product.
the
end
result
is
identical
whether
or
not
it’s
produced
by
greater
buffalo
or
international,
it’s
this
comic
supplement.
but
the
two
firms
follow
a
different
method
of
distributing
their
product.
greater
buffalo
sells
primarily
directly
to
newspapers.
it
sells
to
a
few
of
the
syndicates
but
basically
sells
to
the
newspapers.
international
has
no
business
relations
at
all
with
the
newspapers
except
that
it
ships
the
comics,
it
deals
exclusively
with
king
and
it
has
dealt
exclusively
with
king
for
almost
30
years.
king
under
the
contracts
is
obligated
to
give
at
least
75%
of
its
printing
requirements
to
international.
the
other
25%
i
might
add
in
passing
is
because
on
the
west
coast,
it’s
just
not
economically
feasible
to
print
in
the
east
and
ship
it
to
the
west
coast
because
printing
is
very
expensive.
now,
what
happens
in
the
case
of
king
is
that
king
goes
out
and
actually
sells
the
comics
to
the
newspapers.
king
sells
the
comics
to
the
newspapers.
king
has
his
arrangement
with
international
and
has
had
it
for
many
years
under
which
international
does
the
printing
and
king’s
profit
of
course
represents
the
difference
between
what
it
pays
international
and
what
it
can
sell
the
comics
to
the
newspapers
for.
and
the
newspapers,
all
of
their
business
dealings
are
with
king,
they
pay
their
bills
to
king
and
king
in
turn
then
pays
international.
but
of
course,
the
price
that
king
pays
to
international
necessarily
determines
what
kind
of
an
offer
king
in
turn
can
make
to
the
newspapers
and
not
unexpectedly,
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
over
the
years,
there
were
constant
battles
between
king
on
the
one
hand
and
international
on
the
other
over
price.
and
king
on
occasions
forced
international
to
cut
its
prices
in
order
that
king
could
meet
a
particular
competitive
situation.
king
had
something
of
a
club
over1210
international
in
this
respect
because
up
to
the
time
of
the
merger,
king
had
a
six
month
cancellation
clause
in
its
contract.
it
could
cancel
for
any
reason
within
six
months.
at
the
time
of
the
merger
in
june
of
1965,
king
and
international
were
negotiating
a
new
printing
contract
which
they
wanted
to
be
a
long
term
contract.
about
a
month
after
the
acquisition
was
consummated,
they
did
sign
a
long
term
contract
with
the
same
prices
they
had
before
but
it
had
no
six
months
cancellation
clause.
however,
and
we
think
this
is
quite
significant
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment,
at
the
time
the
merger
was
taking
place,
a
week
before
the
merger
agreement
was
finally
signed,
international
and
king
had
agreed
upon
the
prices
to
be
charged
under
that
contract.
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
king
and
international
each
had
sales
of
about
$8,500,000.00.
there’s
a
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
what
their
respective
shares
of
the
market
was.
the
disputes
is
over
whether
or
not
in
calculating
the
market,
you
include
in
the
market
printing
that
is
done
by
newspapers
themselves.
the
government
contends
that
that
printing
should
not
be
included
because
we
say
while
the
newspaper
might
give
its
business
to
one
of
this
printers,
it's
unlikely
that
any
newspaper
would
be
a
source
of
printing
for
other
newspapers.
under
our
study
of
the
market
as
we
interpret
under
our
evaluation
of
it,
together,
these
two
firms
had
roughly
75%
of
volume
of
printing
done
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
under
the
--mr.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
75%
of
the
two-thirds.
under
the
defendant’s
evaluation,
the
two
firms
together
had
just
under
42%
of
the
whole
market.
their
42%
is
42%
of
the
whole
market,
or
it
is
75%
of
the
two-third.
but
under
either
standard,
these
two
firms
simply
dwarf
the
rest
of
the
industry.
each
of
these
firms
was
at
least
five
times
as
large
as
any
of
the
other
four
or
five
independent
printers.
now,
the
facts
relating
to
the
acquisition
were
relatively
simple,
the
original
organizer
of
internationally
acquired
company
had
been
dead
for
many
years.
the
stock
of
the
company
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
owned
by
two
of
his
children
who
had
made
no
investment
in
the
company,
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
running
of
the
business,
they
let
mr.
gorman,
the
president
of
international
run
it
and
the
sole
interest
was
in
the
dividend,
as
they
could
get
out
of
the
company.
and
finally,
they
tried
to
sell
this
plant
in
1952
to
hearst
and
king
and
hearst
was
not
interested.
in
1954,
in
the
december
of
1954,
negotiations
began
between
the
president
of
international
and
the
president
of
greater
buffalo.
international’s
men
indicated
the
property,
thought
could
be
purchased
at
the
book
value
and
that
was
ultimately
done
in
june
of
1955
at
a
price
of
$575,000.00.
the
record
shows
that
gorman,
the
president
of
international
kept
king
fully
informed
during
the
whole
course
of
these
negotiations
of
what
was
going
on.
and
three
months
before
the
acquisition
took
place,
in
march
of
1955,
the
sale’s
manager
of
king,
a
man
named
knight
wrote
a
memo
to
his
superior
in
which
he
pointed
out
the
key
role
that
king
occupied
in
connection
with
this
merger.
as
he
said
that
although
the
owners
of
international
are
anxious
to
sell,
they
can
hardly
sell
without
our
consent
and
cooperation.
and
he
further
added
that
the
greater
buffalo
realizes
they
can
hardly
continue
the
purchased
plans
without
our
approval.
now
of
course,
the
reason
for
king’s
control
over
this
thing
is
quite
obvious.
without
the
arrangements
that
international
had
with
king,
or
international
had
with
the
printing
plant
and
no
costumers.
international
did
not
have
any
selling
organization.
but
on
the
other
hand,
king
also
had
a
very
real
stake
in
this
thing
because
king
at
this
time
was
basically
dependent
upon
international
for
its
printing.
and
i
will
come
in
a
minute
now
to
what
the
district
court
said
and
explain
the
significance
of
why
this
interrelationship
as
a
practical
matter
meant
that
even
though
the
contract
between
king
and
international
was
not
signed
until
a
month
after
merger
in
fact,
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
greater
buffalo
knew
that
by
acquiring
international,
it
was
acquiring
basically
king’s
printing
presses.
the
district
court
held
against
us
under
section
7
issue
on
really
two
grounds.
first,
the
district
court
said
that
because
of
the
advantage
king
has
in
selling
printing
as
a
result
of
its
control
over
the
features,
there
were
two
different
markets
here,
one
market
said
the
court
was
a
printing
of
comic
color
supplements
for
sale
directly
to
the
newspapers.
and
the
other
market
was
for
sale
to
the
syndicates
which
then
sell
them
to
those
newspapers.
and
then
the
court
went
on
and
said
this
--
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
may
not
have
been
substantially
to
lessen
competition
because
in
the
first
place
it
said,
greater
buffalo
and
international
not
in
competition,
they’re
not
in
the
same
markets.
international
is
selling
to
one
market
that
is
to
the
syndicates,
greater
buffalo
is
selling
only
to
the
other
market
to
the
newspapers
themselves,
they’re
not
in
the
same
market
so
there
could
be
no
elimination
of
competition
between
them.
secondly,
they
said
that
since
at
the
time
of
the
--
court
said
since
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
king
had
no
firm
contract
with
international,
greater
buffalo
was
not
acquiring
any
share
of
the
printing
business.
it
was
just
acquiring
an
expectation
that
with
its
skills,
it
could
pickup
some
of
this
business
and
finally,
it
said
i
any
event,
international
was
a
failing
company.
then
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
portion
dealing
with
the
section
7
violation,
the
court
said
but
even
if
there
were
some
violations
of
section
7
here
would
not
be
appropriate
to
order
the
divestiture
15
years
after
the
acquisition
takes
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
is
an
evidence
that
there’s
one
firm
developed
very
rapidly
short
in
the
early
1960’s.
there’s
a
dispute
between
as
there's
to
the
ease
of
entry.
the
district
court
found
that
there
were
no
substantial
barriers
to
entry.
the
claim
is
that
anybody
can
print,
all
you
need
is
a
printing
press,
that
there’s
plenty
of
surplus
capacity
in
this
great
ease
of
entry.
we
think
that
there
are
real
serious
barriers
to
entry
in
this
business
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
is
a
very
skilled
thing,
this
is
not
just
turning
a
press
on
and
printing,
you’ve
got
to
know
what
you’re
doing.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
large
number
of
newspapers
have
found
it
financially
advantageous
to
them
to
ship
their
printing
business
from
their
own
printing
facilities
to
one
of
these
printers.
in
addition,
once
you
have
a
firm
which
has
75%
of
the
printing
market
available,
that
is
for
the
purpose
who
don’t
print
their
own,
it
seems
to
me
this
itself
as
has
been
recognized
creates
a
substantial
barrier
to
entry
and
i
can
say
i
know
of
no
new
firms
that
have
gone
into
the
business.
in
fact,
in
1965,
i’m
sorry,
1955
shortly
after
this
acquisition,
another
independent
color
printer
went
out
of
business,
that
was
a
firm
called
buffalo
color
press,
a
smaller
printer
which
greater
buffalo
also
acquired
it
was
doing
printing
for
another
one
of
the
syndicates
in
this
case.
now,
we
start
it
seems
to
me
with
a
self
evident
proposition
which
is
basically
greater
buffalo
and
international
are
in
the
same
business,
they’re
both
printing
this
thing.
and
of
course,
an
essential
element
of
the
printing
of
this
thing
is
getting
it
distributed
to
its
costumers,
to
the
ultimate
costumers
the
newspapers.
and
it
seems
to
us
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
that
a
particular
distributor
such
as
king
may
have
had
some
advantages
in
distribution,
it’s
still
the
same
product.
it
doesn’t
seize
to
be
a
differ
--
it
doesn’t
become
a
different
product
merely
because
one
firm
is
distributing
it
through
king
and
the
other
firm
is
distributing
directly.
and
therefore,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we
think
that
the
business
of
printing
and
selling
color
comic
supplements
was
a
relevant
market.
i
stress
the
word
“a”
because
it
may
well
be
that
printing
for
syndicates
is
also
an
independent
relevant
market
but
certainly,
this
is
a
relevant
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
international,
three
quarters.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
of
it,
all
of
it.
international
printed
only
for
king.
international
had
no
contacts,
no
contracts,
no
printing
itself
for
any
respective
direct
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
that’s
the
way
international
had
done
business
and
i
think
when
it
started
in
1925,
it
had
two
small
customers
and
for
almost
30-years,
it
was
printing
exclusively
for
king.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
within
this
broader
line
of
commerce
which
we
think
is
the
relevant
market
that
is
sale
and
printing,
we
think
that
it
would
be
no
doubt
that
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
may
have
been
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
the
district
court
found
and
no
one
disputes
it
that
greater
buffalo
and
king
were
engaged
in
active
competition
for
the
business
of
printing
color
comic
supplements.
and
this
competition
between
them
and
selling
the
printing
necessarily
reflected
and
was
dependent
upon
the
competition
between
greater
buffalo
and
international
in
printing
because
only
if
international
kept
its
prices
low
enough,
would
king
be
in
a
position
to
compete
effectively
with
greater
buffalo
and
i
think
the
realities
of
this
were
recognized
in
1954
in
a
letter
that
mr.
gorman,
the
president
of
international
wrote
to
the
unions
when
he
was
complaining
that
the
unions
were
putting
very
owner’s
conditions
upon
but
he
couldn’t
be
with
them
because
his
complaint.
he
said,
he
referred
to
greater
buffalo
repeatedly
as
his
competitor
and
he
was
complaining
that
greater
buffalo
was
taking
business
away
from
him
because
of
the
owner’s
burdens.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
it,
yes.
what
international
said,
this
is
exhibit
p9
at
785
of
the
record.
that's
a
rather
long
letter
and
he
keeps
complaining
for
the
unions,
he
says
“i’m
losing
business
to
my
competitors
and
the
demands
you’re
making
for
me
in
the
way
of
labor
conditions
are
unfair
for
that
reason.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
greater
buffalo
was
doing
a
little
printing
for
king
back
in
the
mid
1950’s
and
those
evidence
that
on
one
occasion,
it
began
that
mr.
knight
of
king
was
distressed
because
he
didn’t
think
he
was
getting
a
good
enough
deal
from
international.
so
he
transferred
some
business
to
greater
buffalo
and
as
a
rather
revealing
quotation
in
which
he
said
and
this
is
at
page
1428
of
the
record,
he
said
he
had
shifted
business
to
greater
buffalo
at
a
lower
rate
and
that
gorman,
the
president
of
international
understands,
he
is
likely
to
lose
other
business
because
of
inability
to
meet
the
rates
i’ve
been
able
to
obtain
from
greater
buffalo?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
about
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
this
was
within
a
few
months
or
two
of
each
other,
both
of
these
were
1954.
now,
the
effect
of
this
merger
was
very
drastically
to
change
the
structure
of
the
market.
previous
to
the
merger,
what
you
had
was
two
very
large
firms,
each
with
roughly
35%
to
40%
of
the
market
competing
with
each
other
in
four
and
five
smaller
firms.
after
the
merger,
you
had
one
major
firm
that
really
stood
like
a
colossus
over
this
market,
had
roughly
75%
of
the
business.
the
competition
that
previously
had
existed
between
international
and
greater
buffalo
in
printing
in
keeping
prices
down
and
approving
service
necessarily
was
basically
eliminated.
and
while
my
opponent
will
tell
the
court
as
he
had
in
brief
that
despite
all
of
these
facts,
there
was
plenty
of
competition
in
the
industry,
the
significant
thing
it
seems
to
me
for
section
7
purpose
is
whether
or
not
this
merger
significantly
lessened
competition,
and
on
that
issue
we
think
the
record
abundantly
shows
that
it
did.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
is
seeking
the
divestiture
of
the
sylacauga
plant
not
to
aid
the
wrong
doer
hearst.
but
because
we
think
that
under
normal
principles
governing
divestiture,
what
you
have
to
have
is
plant,
the
entity
to
be
divested
must
be
capable
at
functioning
as
a
strong
effective
competitive
factor
in
the
market.
now,
the
way
this
market
is
now
structured,
what
it
means
is
for
international
to
take
up
the
kind
--
to
become
the
kind
of
plant
that
is
necessary
to
provide
competition
to
greater
buffalo,
it’s
got
to
have
a
facility
in
the
south.
because
the
newspaper
customers
down
there
now
are
used
to
a
sudden
plant.
they
save
substantial
money
as
a
result
of
the
saving
of
transportation
costs.
we’re
not
of
course
suggesting
–-
as
mr.
raichle
somehow
suggested
that
we’re
trying
to
put
hearst
into
the
printing
business.
well
of
course,
we’re
not
saying
that
the
plant
has
to
be
divested
to
hearst.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
when
you
divest
international
and
of
course
i
just
mentioned
in
passing
divestiture
is
the
normal
remedy,
when
you
have
a
--
has
stock
out
position
that
violates
the
act.
when
you
divest
it,
you
got
to
divest
it
in
a
way
that
makes
it
into
a
strong
competitive
force
in
the
market.
and
that
requires,
we
think
sylacauga
plant
be
included.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
equities
relating
for
the
situation
of
the
individual
firms
in
this
situation
must
be
bounced
against
the
demands
of
the
public
interest
in
restoring
effective
competition
here
and
i
think
that
in
this
situation,
it
is
appropriate
to
divest.
i’d
like
to
add
if
i
may
just
one
thing
on
how
this
sylacauga
plant
was
developed
for
a
year
before
the
acquisition,
international
was
playing
a
very
active
role
in
working
out
its
own
plants.
many
of
its
people
had
made
lengthy
trips
to
sylacauga
to
investigate
the
situation.
international
was
under
constant
pressure
for
king
to
build
a
southern
plant.
and
indeed,
they
had
written
in
the
spring
of
1955.
international
had
twice
informed
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
sylacauga
that
it
had
definitely
decided
to
move
to
sylacauga,
to
build
a
plant
in
sylacauga.
and
it’s
true
that
at
that
point,
it
did
not
have
the
financing
available
but
it
seems
in
the
light
of
the
pressures
that
were
coming
upon
international
from
king
and
in
the
light
of
all
these
extensive
plants,
it’s
certainly
most
reasonable
and
most
likely
that
it
--
there
hasn’t
been
a
situation,
international
somehow
would
have
found
a
way
to
build
the
plant.
now
it’s
quite
true
the
plant
was
actually
built
by
greater
buffalo
and
greater
buffalo
paid
for
it.
but
it
seems
at
least
in
inception
and
spirit
of
the
thing,
that
this
was
enough
of
an
international
plant
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
require
that
it
be
divested
in
order
to
establish
the
kind
of
a
strong
company
that
is
necessary
to
restore
competition
in
this
industry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
nothing
remarkable
about
but
with
this
exception
mr.
chief
justice,
this
move
into
the
deep
south
was
not
the
typical
move
where
a
firm
finds
that
this
is
an
attractive
area
for
various
reasons
to
develop
a
new
factory.
this
move
into
the
deep
south
was
because
of
the
--
basically
because
of
the
transportation
situation,
that
is
the
newspapers
located
in
the
deep
south
would
be
much
better-off
financially
if
they
had
a
nearby
plant.
and
it’s
the
newspapers
i
should
mention,
it’s
the
newspapers
not
the
printers
that
pay
the
cost
of
transporting
the
supplements
form
the
printing
plant
to
the
newspaper
plant.
and
i
think,
this
is
what’s
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
an
attempt,
it
is,
they
moved
in
there
because
they
needed
the
plant
and
i
think
is
a
realistic
matter
if
you
divest
international.
if
you
divest
international
without
this
plant
down
south,
it’s
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
there
to
be
any
really
effective
competition
created
by
international.
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
basic
purpose
of
relief
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
direct
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york,
brings
before
the
court
the
validity
of
a
1955
merger
between
the
two
leading
firms
engaged
in
the
printing
of
color
comic
supplements
for
newspapers.
the
appeal
presents
a
group
of
typical
section
7
questions,
the
definition
of
the
relevant
product
market,
the
question
whether
the
effect
of
the
merger
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition,
the
question
whether
the
acquired
company
was
a
failing
company
and
the
question
of
whether
divestiture
was
a
appropriate
relief.
there
are
three
principal
firms
involved
in
this
case
which
i
will
describe
briefly.the
acquiring
firm,
the
appellee
greater
buffalo
press,
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
had
a
plant
in
buffalo
and
also
a
plant
in
dunkirk,
new
york.
the
second
firm
is
the
acquired
company,
international
color
press.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
it
also
had
two
plants,
one
in
wilkes
barre,
pennsylvania
and
the
other
in
peoria,
illinois
but
the
peoria
plant
has
been
closed.
the
third
principal
actor
in
this
story
is
a
firm
called
king
syndicate,
that
is
a
division
of
the
hearst
corporation.
king
itself
is
not
a
printer.
it
is
engaged
in
syndication
of
copywrited
articles,
features,
comic
scripts,
cartoons,
two
newspapers.
what
king
does
is
engages
in
two
forms
of
activity.
first,
it
licenses
features
to
the
newspapers
and
secondly,
it
arranges
for
the
printing
of
those
comic
supplements
to
the
newspapers
that
wish
it.
the
government
complaint
which
was
filed
in
1961
challenged
not
only
the
merger
that
is
here
before
the
court
but
also
alleged
that
greater
buffalo,
hearst
through
king
and
another
syndicate
had
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
divide
costumers,
to
fix
prices
and
to
monopolize
the
printing
of
color
comic
supplements
alleged
that
king
and
the
other
newspaper
syndicate
had
also
engaged
in
illegal
tying
agreements
under
which
the
claim
was
that
the
licensing
of
the
comic
supplements
was
tied
to
the
dealing
with
the
syndicate
for
printing.
in
1965,
the
government
settled
a
case
against
hearst
through
the
entry
of
a
consent
judgment
under
which
there
were
various
prohibitions
upon
hearst
including
a
prohibition
upon
engaging
in
tying
agreements
although
the
judgment
at
that
--
that
judgment
does
not
preclude
king
from
quoting
a
single
price
for
features
and
printing
for
the
licensing
that
is
and
the
printing.
however,
that
judgment
also
contains
provisions
that
in
the
event
greater
buffalo
is
found
to
have
violated
any
provision
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
judgment
may
then
be
reopened.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
10
years,
well,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
describe
about
the
chronology
of
it
and
explain
why.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
10
years
from
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
16
since
the
merger
filed,
let
me
--
if
i
may
explain
just
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
merger
took
place
in
1955,
two
or
three
years
thereafter,
an
employee
of
another
firm
made
a
complaint
to
the
department
of
justice
that
hearst
was
engaging
in
tie-ins.
following
this
complaint
and
some
preliminary
investigation,
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
in
buffalo,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
grand
jury,
the
government
decided
not
to
seek
an
indictment
but
instead
to
bring
a
civil
suit.
now,
the
original
complaint
did
not
relate
of
course
to
the
merger,
the
original
complaint
related
to
the
tie-ins
by
hearst
and
king
but
in
the
course
of
our
investigation,
we
developed
other
facts
including
the
fact
relating
to
the
merger
which
led
us
to
conclude
that
there
were
violations
in
addition
to
those
that
had
been
brought
to
our
attention.
now,
the
10
years
between
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed
and
the
case
comes
to
this
court
as
occupied
by
a
series
of
situations.
first,
two
or
three
years
were
occupied
by
the
government’s
first
successful
attempt
to
obtain
a
preliminary
injunction
against
greater,
the
transfer
of
certain
assets
in
the
wilkes
barre
plant
of
international
to
a
plant
that
had
been
built
down
in
sylacauga,
alabama.
following
that,
we
had
the
negotiations
over
the
consent
decree
which
led
to
the
consent
decree
against
hearst.
the
trial
actually
began
in
october
of
1965
and
of
course,
in
the
end
of
all,
i
might
add
that
after
we
had
gotten
the
preliminary
injunction,
then
there
were
further
proceedings
with
more
testimony
taken
on
a
motion
by
the
appellee
to
modify
the
injunction.
following
the
completion
of
the
government’s
case
in
october
of
1965,
in
1966
there
was
hearing
on
whether
the
government
had
established
a
prima
facia
case
and
a
year
and
a
half
elapsed
after
that
hearing
until
the
defendant’s
case
came
in.
the
defendant’s
case
came
in
in
the
summer
of
1967.
briefs
were
filed
about
a
year
thereafter.
closing
arguments
were
not
had
until
a
year
thereafter
which
was
in
december
of
1969.
now,
the
reason
for
all
these
delays
was
basically,
this
is
as
i
understand
it,
at
that
time
in
the
latter
part
of
the
1960’s,
there
was
only
one
judge
on
the
bench
in
baltimore,
that
was
judge
henderson
of
those
buffalo,
i’m
sorry,
buffalo.
after
a
successor
judge
was
appointed,
the
man
selected
for
the
post
was
the
united
states
attorney
and
as
a
result,
this
new
judge
was
not
qualified
to
hear
any
of
the
pending
criminal
cases.
and
since
criminal
cases
were
given
a
priority,
it
meant
that
judge
henderson
was
required
to
spend
the
major
part
of
his
time
in
this
period
on
trying
the
criminal
cases
and
just
had
to
work
this
case
in
as
he
could,
that
this
was
the
reason
for
the
delay.
i
don’t
think
that
the
delay
is
attributable
to
the
government
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it’s
an
unfortunate,
i
think
these
delays
in
these
cases
are
always
unfortunate,
i’m
afraid
this
was
just
one
of
those
circumstances,
we
tried
to
do
everything
we
could,
we
dropped
a
charge
of
violating
section
2,
a
monopolization
charge
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
expedite
the
thing,
we
did
everything
we
could
to
get
the
case
moving
because
i
think
just
one
of
those
unfortunate
things
where
the
judicial
process
sometimes
moves
slowly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
that’s
all
we
have
appealed
from,
is
the
court’s
dismissal
of
the
section
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
stated
explicitly
in
a
motion,
in
a
notice
we
filed
stating
that
we
were
dropping
the
monopolization
charges,
we
were
doing
so
for
the
purpose
of
expediting
trial
of
the
case.
that
is
set
forth
at
page
518
and
519
i
think
of
the
record,
that
was
the
reason.
now,
coming
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
most
sunday
newspapers
in
this
country
have
what
i
have
in
my
hand
a
typical
comic
color
supplements.
the
supplement
has
two
elements
to
it
basically,
a
newspaper
that
wants
a
supplement
has
to
get
two
things.
these
different
features
are
all
copyrighted
and
the
newspaper
has
to
get
a
license
for
these
features.
in
addition,
the
newspaper
has
to
arrange
to
have
the
supplement
printed
and
the
printing
of
comic
color
supplements
is
a
very
--
requires
special
skill,
it’s
not
something
that
can
be
done,
they’re
done
with
four
different
inks
and
it
takes
great
techniques
to
accomplish
this.
the
licenses
for
using
the
comic
color
comics
themselves
are
controlled
by
the
syndicates
and
the
syndicate’s
license
to
a
newspaper
as
many
of
these
particular
comics
as
they
want.
sometimes,
the
newspaper
will
get
all
of
its
particular
comics
from
a
single
syndicate
more
likely
it
will
be
a
combination
in
this
one
of
the
washington
post
shows
that
the
different
comics
come
from
half
a
dozen
or
more
syndicates.
now,
approximately
one
third
of
all
of
these
color
comic
supplements
are
printed
by
the
newspapers
themselves,
the
remaining
two
thirds
are
printed
by
the
so-called
comic
color
supplement
printers
which
the
two
merging
companies
were
the
two
leading
ones.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
and
even
to
this
day,
everyone
concedes
that
greater
buffalo
press
is
the
leader
in
the
comic
supplement
field,
it
is
the
most
skilled
one.
it
is
the
firm
that
can
produce
the
best
product.
both
of
these
firms
of
course
produced
the
same
product.
the
end
result
is
identical
whether
or
not
it’s
produced
by
greater
buffalo
or
international,
it’s
this
comic
supplement.
but
the
two
firms
follow
a
different
method
of
distributing
their
product.
greater
buffalo
sells
primarily
directly
to
newspapers.
it
sells
to
a
few
of
the
syndicates
but
basically
sells
to
the
newspapers.
international
has
no
business
relations
at
all
with
the
newspapers
except
that
it
ships
the
comics,
it
deals
exclusively
with
king
and
it
has
dealt
exclusively
with
king
for
almost
30
years.
king
under
the
contracts
is
obligated
to
give
at
least
75%
of
its
printing
requirements
to
international.
the
other
25%
i
might
add
in
passing
is
because
on
the
west
coast,
it’s
just
not
economically
feasible
to
print
in
the
east
and
ship
it
to
the
west
coast
because
printing
is
very
expensive.
now,
what
happens
in
the
case
of
king
is
that
king
goes
out
and
actually
sells
the
comics
to
the
newspapers.
king
sells
the
comics
to
the
newspapers.
king
has
his
arrangement
with
international
and
has
had
it
for
many
years
under
which
international
does
the
printing
and
king’s
profit
of
course
represents
the
difference
between
what
it
pays
international
and
what
it
can
sell
the
comics
to
the
newspapers
for.
and
the
newspapers,
all
of
their
business
dealings
are
with
king,
they
pay
their
bills
to
king
and
king
in
turn
then
pays
international.
but
of
course,
the
price
that
king
pays
to
international
necessarily
determines
what
kind
of
an
offer
king
in
turn
can
make
to
the
newspapers
and
not
unexpectedly,
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
over
the
years,
there
were
constant
battles
between
king
on
the
one
hand
and
international
on
the
other
over
price.
and
king
on
occasions
forced
international
to
cut
its
prices
in
order
that
king
could
meet
a
particular
competitive
situation.
king
had
something
of
a
club
over1210
international
in
this
respect
because
up
to
the
time
of
the
merger,
king
had
a
six
month
cancellation
clause
in
its
contract.
it
could
cancel
for
any
reason
within
six
months.
at
the
time
of
the
merger
in
june
of
1965,
king
and
international
were
negotiating
a
new
printing
contract
which
they
wanted
to
be
a
long
term
contract.
about
a
month
after
the
acquisition
was
consummated,
they
did
sign
a
long
term
contract
with
the
same
prices
they
had
before
but
it
had
no
six
months
cancellation
clause.
however,
and
we
think
this
is
quite
significant
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment,
at
the
time
the
merger
was
taking
place,
a
week
before
the
merger
agreement
was
finally
signed,
international
and
king
had
agreed
upon
the
prices
to
be
charged
under
that
contract.
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
king
and
international
each
had
sales
of
about
$8,500,000.00.
there’s
a
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
what
their
respective
shares
of
the
market
was.
the
disputes
is
over
whether
or
not
in
calculating
the
market,
you
include
in
the
market
printing
that
is
done
by
newspapers
themselves.
the
government
contends
that
that
printing
should
not
be
included
because
we
say
while
the
newspaper
might
give
its
business
to
one
of
this
printers,
it's
unlikely
that
any
newspaper
would
be
a
source
of
printing
for
other
newspapers.
under
our
study
of
the
market
as
we
interpret
under
our
evaluation
of
it,
together,
these
two
firms
had
roughly
75%
of
volume
of
printing
done
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
under
the
--mr.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
75%
of
the
two-thirds.
under
the
defendant’s
evaluation,
the
two
firms
together
had
just
under
42%
of
the
whole
market.
their
42%
is
42%
of
the
whole
market,
or
it
is
75%
of
the
two-third.
but
under
either
standard,
these
two
firms
simply
dwarf
the
rest
of
the
industry.
each
of
these
firms
was
at
least
five
times
as
large
as
any
of
the
other
four
or
five
independent
printers.
now,
the
facts
relating
to
the
acquisition
were
relatively
simple,
the
original
organizer
of
internationally
acquired
company
had
been
dead
for
many
years.
the
stock
of
the
company
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
owned
by
two
of
his
children
who
had
made
no
investment
in
the
company,
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
running
of
the
business,
they
let
mr.
gorman,
the
president
of
international
run
it
and
the
sole
interest
was
in
the
dividend,
as
they
could
get
out
of
the
company.
and
finally,
they
tried
to
sell
this
plant
in
1952
to
hearst
and
king
and
hearst
was
not
interested.
in
1954,
in
the
december
of
1954,
negotiations
began
between
the
president
of
international
and
the
president
of
greater
buffalo.
international’s
men
indicated
the
property,
thought
could
be
purchased
at
the
book
value
and
that
was
ultimately
done
in
june
of
1955
at
a
price
of
$575,000.00.
the
record
shows
that
gorman,
the
president
of
international
kept
king
fully
informed
during
the
whole
course
of
these
negotiations
of
what
was
going
on.
and
three
months
before
the
acquisition
took
place,
in
march
of
1955,
the
sale’s
manager
of
king,
a
man
named
knight
wrote
a
memo
to
his
superior
in
which
he
pointed
out
the
key
role
that
king
occupied
in
connection
with
this
merger.
as
he
said
that
although
the
owners
of
international
are
anxious
to
sell,
they
can
hardly
sell
without
our
consent
and
cooperation.
and
he
further
added
that
the
greater
buffalo
realizes
they
can
hardly
continue
the
purchased
plans
without
our
approval.
now
of
course,
the
reason
for
king’s
control
over
this
thing
is
quite
obvious.
without
the
arrangements
that
international
had
with
king,
or
international
had
with
the
printing
plant
and
no
costumers.
international
did
not
have
any
selling
organization.
but
on
the
other
hand,
king
also
had
a
very
real
stake
in
this
thing
because
king
at
this
time
was
basically
dependent
upon
international
for
its
printing.
and
i
will
come
in
a
minute
now
to
what
the
district
court
said
and
explain
the
significance
of
why
this
interrelationship
as
a
practical
matter
meant
that
even
though
the
contract
between
king
and
international
was
not
signed
until
a
month
after
merger
in
fact,
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
greater
buffalo
knew
that
by
acquiring
international,
it
was
acquiring
basically
king’s
printing
presses.
the
district
court
held
against
us
under
section
7
issue
on
really
two
grounds.
first,
the
district
court
said
that
because
of
the
advantage
king
has
in
selling
printing
as
a
result
of
its
control
over
the
features,
there
were
two
different
markets
here,
one
market
said
the
court
was
a
printing
of
comic
color
supplements
for
sale
directly
to
the
newspapers.
and
the
other
market
was
for
sale
to
the
syndicates
which
then
sell
them
to
those
newspapers.
and
then
the
court
went
on
and
said
this
--
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
may
not
have
been
substantially
to
lessen
competition
because
in
the
first
place
it
said,
greater
buffalo
and
international
not
in
competition,
they’re
not
in
the
same
markets.
international
is
selling
to
one
market
that
is
to
the
syndicates,
greater
buffalo
is
selling
only
to
the
other
market
to
the
newspapers
themselves,
they’re
not
in
the
same
market
so
there
could
be
no
elimination
of
competition
between
them.
secondly,
they
said
that
since
at
the
time
of
the
--
court
said
since
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
king
had
no
firm
contract
with
international,
greater
buffalo
was
not
acquiring
any
share
of
the
printing
business.
it
was
just
acquiring
an
expectation
that
with
its
skills,
it
could
pickup
some
of
this
business
and
finally,
it
said
i
any
event,
international
was
a
failing
company.
then
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
portion
dealing
with
the
section
7
violation,
the
court
said
but
even
if
there
were
some
violations
of
section
7
here
would
not
be
appropriate
to
order
the
divestiture
15
years
after
the
acquisition
takes
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
is
an
evidence
that
there’s
one
firm
developed
very
rapidly
short
in
the
early
1960’s.
there’s
a
dispute
between
as
there's
to
the
ease
of
entry.
the
district
court
found
that
there
were
no
substantial
barriers
to
entry.
the
claim
is
that
anybody
can
print,
all
you
need
is
a
printing
press,
that
there’s
plenty
of
surplus
capacity
in
this
great
ease
of
entry.
we
think
that
there
are
real
serious
barriers
to
entry
in
this
business
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
is
a
very
skilled
thing,
this
is
not
just
turning
a
press
on
and
printing,
you’ve
got
to
know
what
you’re
doing.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
large
number
of
newspapers
have
found
it
financially
advantageous
to
them
to
ship
their
printing
business
from
their
own
printing
facilities
to
one
of
these
printers.
in
addition,
once
you
have
a
firm
which
has
75%
of
the
printing
market
available,
that
is
for
the
purpose
who
don’t
print
their
own,
it
seems
to
me
this
itself
as
has
been
recognized
creates
a
substantial
barrier
to
entry
and
i
can
say
i
know
of
no
new
firms
that
have
gone
into
the
business.
in
fact,
in
1965,
i’m
sorry,
1955
shortly
after
this
acquisition,
another
independent
color
printer
went
out
of
business,
that
was
a
firm
called
buffalo
color
press,
a
smaller
printer
which
greater
buffalo
also
acquired
it
was
doing
printing
for
another
one
of
the
syndicates
in
this
case.
now,
we
start
it
seems
to
me
with
a
self
evident
proposition
which
is
basically
greater
buffalo
and
international
are
in
the
same
business,
they’re
both
printing
this
thing.
and
of
course,
an
essential
element
of
the
printing
of
this
thing
is
getting
it
distributed
to
its
costumers,
to
the
ultimate
costumers
the
newspapers.
and
it
seems
to
us
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
that
a
particular
distributor
such
as
king
may
have
had
some
advantages
in
distribution,
it’s
still
the
same
product.
it
doesn’t
seize
to
be
a
differ
--
it
doesn’t
become
a
different
product
merely
because
one
firm
is
distributing
it
through
king
and
the
other
firm
is
distributing
directly.
and
therefore,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
we
think
that
the
business
of
printing
and
selling
color
comic
supplements
was
a
relevant
market.
i
stress
the
word
“a”
because
it
may
well
be
that
printing
for
syndicates
is
also
an
independent
relevant
market
but
certainly,
this
is
a
relevant
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
international,
three
quarters.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
of
it,
all
of
it.
international
printed
only
for
king.
international
had
no
contacts,
no
contracts,
no
printing
itself
for
any
respective
direct
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
that’s
the
way
international
had
done
business
and
i
think
when
it
started
in
1925,
it
had
two
small
customers
and
for
almost
30-years,
it
was
printing
exclusively
for
king.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
within
this
broader
line
of
commerce
which
we
think
is
the
relevant
market
that
is
sale
and
printing,
we
think
that
it
would
be
no
doubt
that
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
may
have
been
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
the
district
court
found
and
no
one
disputes
it
that
greater
buffalo
and
king
were
engaged
in
active
competition
for
the
business
of
printing
color
comic
supplements.
and
this
competition
between
them
and
selling
the
printing
necessarily
reflected
and
was
dependent
upon
the
competition
between
greater
buffalo
and
international
in
printing
because
only
if
international
kept
its
prices
low
enough,
would
king
be
in
a
position
to
compete
effectively
with
greater
buffalo
and
i
think
the
realities
of
this
were
recognized
in
1954
in
a
letter
that
mr.
gorman,
the
president
of
international
wrote
to
the
unions
when
he
was
complaining
that
the
unions
were
putting
very
owner’s
conditions
upon
but
he
couldn’t
be
with
them
because
his
complaint.
he
said,
he
referred
to
greater
buffalo
repeatedly
as
his
competitor
and
he
was
complaining
that
greater
buffalo
was
taking
business
away
from
him
because
of
the
owner’s
burdens.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
it,
yes.
what
international
said,
this
is
exhibit
p9
at
785
of
the
record.
that's
a
rather
long
letter
and
he
keeps
complaining
for
the
unions,
he
says
“i’m
losing
business
to
my
competitors
and
the
demands
you’re
making
for
me
in
the
way
of
labor
conditions
are
unfair
for
that
reason.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
greater
buffalo
was
doing
a
little
printing
for
king
back
in
the
mid
1950’s
and
those
evidence
that
on
one
occasion,
it
began
that
mr.
knight
of
king
was
distressed
because
he
didn’t
think
he
was
getting
a
good
enough
deal
from
international.
so
he
transferred
some
business
to
greater
buffalo
and
as
a
rather
revealing
quotation
in
which
he
said
and
this
is
at
page
1428
of
the
record,
he
said
he
had
shifted
business
to
greater
buffalo
at
a
lower
rate
and
that
gorman,
the
president
of
international
understands,
he
is
likely
to
lose
other
business
because
of
inability
to
meet
the
rates
i’ve
been
able
to
obtain
from
greater
buffalo?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
about
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
this
was
within
a
few
months
or
two
of
each
other,
both
of
these
were
1954.
now,
the
effect
of
this
merger
was
very
drastically
to
change
the
structure
of
the
market.
previous
to
the
merger,
what
you
had
was
two
very
large
firms,
each
with
roughly
35%
to
40%
of
the
market
competing
with
each
other
in
four
and
five
smaller
firms.
after
the
merger,
you
had
one
major
firm
that
really
stood
like
a
colossus
over
this
market,
had
roughly
75%
of
the
business.
the
competition
that
previously
had
existed
between
international
and
greater
buffalo
in
printing
in
keeping
prices
down
and
approving
service
necessarily
was
basically
eliminated.
and
while
my
opponent
will
tell
the
court
as
he
had
in
brief
that
despite
all
of
these
facts,
there
was
plenty
of
competition
in
the
industry,
the
significant
thing
it
seems
to
me
for
section
7
purpose
is
whether
or
not
this
merger
significantly
lessened
competition,
and
on
that
issue
we
think
the
record
abundantly
shows
that
it
did.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
is
seeking
the
divestiture
of
the
sylacauga
plant
not
to
aid
the
wrong
doer
hearst.
but
because
we
think
that
under
normal
principles
governing
divestiture,
what
you
have
to
have
is
plant,
the
entity
to
be
divested
must
be
capable
at
functioning
as
a
strong
effective
competitive
factor
in
the
market.
now,
the
way
this
market
is
now
structured,
what
it
means
is
for
international
to
take
up
the
kind
--
to
become
the
kind
of
plant
that
is
necessary
to
provide
competition
to
greater
buffalo,
it’s
got
to
have
a
facility
in
the
south.
because
the
newspaper
customers
down
there
now
are
used
to
a
sudden
plant.
they
save
substantial
money
as
a
result
of
the
saving
of
transportation
costs.
we’re
not
of
course
suggesting
–-
as
mr.
raichle
somehow
suggested
that
we’re
trying
to
put
hearst
into
the
printing
business.
well
of
course,
we’re
not
saying
that
the
plant
has
to
be
divested
to
hearst.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
when
you
divest
international
and
of
course
i
just
mentioned
in
passing
divestiture
is
the
normal
remedy,
when
you
have
a
--
has
stock
out
position
that
violates
the
act.
when
you
divest
it,
you
got
to
divest
it
in
a
way
that
makes
it
into
a
strong
competitive
force
in
the
market.
and
that
requires,
we
think
sylacauga
plant
be
included.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
the
equities
relating
for
the
situation
of
the
individual
firms
in
this
situation
must
be
bounced
against
the
demands
of
the
public
interest
in
restoring
effective
competition
here
and
i
think
that
in
this
situation,
it
is
appropriate
to
divest.
i’d
like
to
add
if
i
may
just
one
thing
on
how
this
sylacauga
plant
was
developed
for
a
year
before
the
acquisition,
international
was
playing
a
very
active
role
in
working
out
its
own
plants.
many
of
its
people
had
made
lengthy
trips
to
sylacauga
to
investigate
the
situation.
international
was
under
constant
pressure
for
king
to
build
a
southern
plant.
and
indeed,
they
had
written
in
the
spring
of
1955.
international
had
twice
informed
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
sylacauga
that
it
had
definitely
decided
to
move
to
sylacauga,
to
build
a
plant
in
sylacauga.
and
it’s
true
that
at
that
point,
it
did
not
have
the
financing
available
but
it
seems
in
the
light
of
the
pressures
that
were
coming
upon
international
from
king
and
in
the
light
of
all
these
extensive
plants,
it’s
certainly
most
reasonable
and
most
likely
that
it
--
there
hasn’t
been
a
situation,
international
somehow
would
have
found
a
way
to
build
the
plant.
now
it’s
quite
true
the
plant
was
actually
built
by
greater
buffalo
and
greater
buffalo
paid
for
it.
but
it
seems
at
least
in
inception
and
spirit
of
the
thing,
that
this
was
enough
of
an
international
plant
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
require
that
it
be
divested
in
order
to
establish
the
kind
of
a
strong
company
that
is
necessary
to
restore
competition
in
this
industry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
nothing
remarkable
about
but
with
this
exception
mr.
chief
justice,
this
move
into
the
deep
south
was
not
the
typical
move
where
a
firm
finds
that
this
is
an
attractive
area
for
various
reasons
to
develop
a
new
factory.
this
move
into
the
deep
south
was
because
of
the
--
basically
because
of
the
transportation
situation,
that
is
the
newspapers
located
in
the
deep
south
would
be
much
better-off
financially
if
they
had
a
nearby
plant.
and
it’s
the
newspapers
i
should
mention,
it’s
the
newspapers
not
the
printers
that
pay
the
cost
of
transporting
the
supplements
form
the
printing
plant
to
the
newspaper
plant.
and
i
think,
this
is
what’s
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
an
attempt,
it
is,
they
moved
in
there
because
they
needed
the
plant
and
i
think
is
a
realistic
matter
if
you
divest
international.
if
you
divest
international
without
this
plant
down
south,
it’s
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
there
to
be
any
really
effective
competition
created
by
international.
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
basic
purpose
of
relief
in
this
case.
