why
did
he
take
his
jacket
off
when
he
went
in
the
courtroom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
missed
the
import
of
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
willing
to
do
all
this
demonstrating
but
he
wouldn’t
want
to
do
it
in
the
courtroom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
lead
me
to
believe
he
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
knew
better
than
to
wear
it
in
the
courtroom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
knew
better
than
to
wear
it
in
the
courtroom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
put
emphasis
that
he
folded
it
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
still
has
the
right
to
parade
around
the
courthouse
halls
with
him
knowing
that
that
building
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
draft,
in
any
form
or
fashion,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
emphasized
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
my
question
is
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
emphasize
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
could
he
have
stepped
on
the
court
hallways
and
yelled
those
words?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
fact
that
he
has
it
placed
on
his
jacket
we
can’t
tell
whether
that’s
allowed
or
why
can't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
somebody
was
walking
up
the
hall
directly
behind
him
couldn’t
help
from
seeing
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
obviously
that’s
why
he
did
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he’d
--
he
didn’t
want
people
to
see
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
people
were
in
the
hallway?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn’t
that
be
helpful
to
know
how
many
were
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
this
same
man
had
used
those
same
words
to
one
person
in
the
corridor
in
a
very
quiet
voice,
would
that
have
violated
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
violate
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
the
record,
in
testimony
that
shows
that
these
words
were
offensive
to
any
person
in
that
building
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
who
in
the
building
was
interested
in
the
draft,
does
the
record
show?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
great
difficulty
is
as
to
what’s
the
difference
between
the
man
whispering
something
in
this
form
up
to
somebody
and
wearing
the
jacket
that
so
far
this
record
shows
only
one
person
saw.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
you
take
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
when
he
came
in
the
building,
how
he
came
in,
how
long
he
was
there
or
how
many
people
saw
him.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
that
two
people
saw
him
and
testified
that
there
were
women
and
children
who
might
have
seen
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
might
not
have
seen
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
say
it
was
offensive
to
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean,
one
word,
don't
you?
but
suppose
he
had
on
his
jacket
“i
don’t
like
the
draft,”
no
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
“i
dislike
the
draft”.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it’s
the
word
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
all
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
absolutely.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
everybody
in
los
angeles
walking
down
the
streets
who
might
use
that
word
subject
to
be
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
got
jail
big
enough.
justice
thurgood

(voice

why

he
