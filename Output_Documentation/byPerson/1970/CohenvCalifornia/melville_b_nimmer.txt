mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
of
course
here
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
state
of
california
upon
this
court’s
order
postponing
jurisdiction
pending
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
chief
justice’s
suggestion
i
certainly
will
keep
very
brief
this
statement
of
facts,
but
fundamentally
we
do
have
here
the
appellant
charged
and
convicted
of
engaging
in
tumultuous
and
offensive
conduct
in
violation
of
the
california
disturbing
the
peace
statute
penal
code
section
415.
although
there
was
a
reversal
upon
the
first
level
of
appeal,
appellant
affirmed
the
superior
of
court,
it
was
then
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
vacated
and
affirmed
the
judgment.
california
supreme
court
refused
the
hearing,
four-to-three
decision
on
that.
and
of
course
fundamentally,
may
it
please
the
court
what
this
young
man
did
was
to
walk
through
a
courthouse
corridor
in
los
angeles
county
on
his
way
to
a
courtroom
where
he
had
some
business.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
blackmun,
he
was
--
although
it’s
not
on
the
record
the
fact
is
he
was
called
there
as
a
witness
in
a
case
which
he
was
not
involved
in
himself.
while
walking
through
that
corridor
he
was
wearing
a
jacket
upon
which
were
inscribed
the
words
“fuck
the
draft”,
also
were
inscribed
the
words
“stop
war”
and
several
peace
symbols.
when
he
entered
the
courtroom,
he
took
off
his
jacket
and
held
it
folded.
when
he
left
the
courtroom,
he
was
arrested
for
disturbing
the
peace,
specifically
engaging
in
tumultuous
and
offensive
conduct.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
held
it
folded
over
his
arm
and
it
was
not
on
view
there.
furthermore,
the
policeman
who
observed
him
walking
through
the
corridor
before
he
went
into
the
courtroom
--
this
is
in
the
record,
requested
the
judge
in
courtroom
to
hold
the
young
man
in
contempt.
the
judge
refused
to
hold
the
young
man
in
contempt
because
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
in
the
courtroom.
i
shouldn’t
say
that,
i
don’t
know
what
he
would
have
done
if
he
did
see
anything.
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen.
and
then
he
left
and
at
that
point
he
was
arrested.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
precisely
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
exactly
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that’s
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
think
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
think
there
are
some
things
that
in
the
courtroom
itself,
while
court
is
in
session
would
be
improper
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
don’t
think
that
arises
in
this
case.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
i
was
making
the
distinction
here
hypothetically
something
had
occurred
in
the
courtroom
while
court
was
in
session
it
might
be
a
different
case.
that
is
not
that
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor
as
far
as
the
record
indicate
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
when
you
get
into
the
question
of
contempt,
which
that
really
raises
this
court’s
standard
that
has
been
adopted
in
numerous
cases
namely
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
speech
creates
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
interference
with
a
judicial
process
would
apply
and
conceivably
and
given
facts
where
those
words
do
appear
during
session
of
the
court
not
merely
in
the
physical
courtroom
but
while
court
is
in
session.
conceivably
that
would
apply
but
that
is
not
this
case
with
all
respect
your
honor.
so
that
this
young
man
was
arrested
while
walking
in
the
corridor
and
i
think
it
is
vital
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
it
is
in
the
los
angeles
county
courthouse
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
it
is,
yes
it
is
a
very
large
one.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
something
like
that
your
honor,
yes.
it
incidentally
is
not
a
courtroom
where
draft
cases
are
tried,
it’s
not
the
federal
court
it’s
the
state
courts.
well,
i
think
it’s
important
at
the
outset
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
violence,
no
component
of
violence
present.
it
is
stated
in
the
settled
statements
signed
by
the
trial
judge
that
the
appellant
did
not
engage
in
violence,
did
not
threaten
violence,
that
no
one
observing
him
engaged
in
violence
or
threat
in
violence.
so
the
violence
component
is
completely
out
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
terribly
significant
for
the
significance
the
broader
significance
of
this
case.
pointing
out
as
it
does
as
it
can
do
depending
on
this
court’s
decision
the
very
vital
distinction
between
dissent
which
may
be
offensive
to
people,
some
people
may
not
like
it
but
non
violent
dissent
and
violent
dissent
--
a
distinction
that
all
too
often
are
younger
--
members
of
the
younger
generation
tend
to
forget.
they
tend
to
equate
violent
dissent
and
dissent
that
may
be
regarded
as
objectionable
or
offensive.
it
is
terribly
important
we
submit
your
honors
that
this
court
may
clear
that
distinction,
that
dissent
by
its
very
nature
involves
the
right
to
be
offensive
if
non-offensive
dissent
is
almost
a
contradiction
in
terms.
because
if
it’s
not
offensive
it
means
you
agree
with
it.
but
on
the
other
hand
violent
dissent
is
something
quite
different.
and
this
--
the
facts
this
case
point
out
precisely
that
distinction,
yet
the
trial
court,
first
of
all,
erroneously
we
submit
quite
clearly
erroneously,
rule
that
it
was
completely
unnecessary
to
show
any
component
of
violence
in
connection
with
the
statute.
and
that
set
forth,
i
think
at
appendix
19
where
they
said
--
the
trial
judge
said,
“simply
if
it’s
offensive
that’s
enough.”
and
we
submit
that
that
clearly
is
unconstitutional
given
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
beyond
that
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
came
to
rule
in
this
case
and
affirmed
the
decision
below
was
not
prepared
to
go
that
far
indicated
that
there
wasn’t
necessity
for
a
violence
component.
but
it’s
very
interesting
to
note
the
way
they
handled
that.
what
they
said
was,
first
they
quoted
appellant’s
position
that
there
must
be
a
likelihood
of
violence
arising
from
offensive
conduct.
and
the
courts
--
the
court
of
appeals,
state
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
the
beginning
says,
“that’s
right.
we
subscribe
to
that
view.
there
must
be
a
likelihood
of
violence
arising
from
the
offensive
conduct.”
but
then
on
the
course
of
the
opinion
they
go
on
to
say,
“it’s
sufficient
if
there’s
a
tendency
to
violence
if
a
violent
act
might
occur.”
and
then
they
say,
“this
might
occur”
because
a
man
walking
with
his
wife
and
children
seeing
this
words
on
the
jacket
“might
emphasize”,
it
was
my
emphasis,
might
resort
to
violence
to
attack
this
man
who
was
exhibiting
this
word
that
is
found
offensive.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
white
i
don’t
think
the
distinction
lies
on
whether
it’s
oral
or
written.
but
if
you
are
suggesting
the
distinction
based
upon
the
fighting
words
concept
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
what?
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes.
if
you
use
these
precise
words
namely
relating
to
the
draft.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
don’t
offhand
see
a
viable
distinction
between
the
written
and
the
oral,
yes.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
but
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
terribly
important
to
suggest,
perhaps
you
were
not
suggesting,
but
it
could
suggest
to
me
this
line
of
fighting
--
the
fighting
words
concept
taken
from
the
chaplinsky
case
decided
by
this
court
some
years
ago.
where
this
court
suggested
that
in
certain
circumstances,
words
may
be
regarded
as
fighting
words
because
men
will
reasonably
know
that
they
will
result
in
violence
and
hence
that
those
words
are
outside
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
no
your
honor.
that’s
precisely
my
point
i
think
they’re
synonymous.
and
hence,
these
are
not
fighting
words
because
they’re
--
well
perhaps
i
should
be
more
specific.
insulting
words,
insulting
the
hearer,
insulting
the
word
--
the
person
to
whom
the
words
are
addressed
is
what
the
basic
concept
of
fighting
words
refers
to,
as
in
chaplinsky,
“dammed,
racketeer
and
fascist.”
here,
there
was
no
attack
of
the
hearer.
there
was
an
opposition
verbal
attack
if
you
will
on
an
institution,
the
selective
service
system
but
not
as
against
any
of
the
viewers
of
this
side.
hence,
we
submit
this
does
not
at
all
come
under
the
chaplinsky
fighting
words
concept.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all
in
terms
of
the
fighting
words
i
don’t
see
any
likelihood
to
the
facts
constituting
those
fighting
words.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
the
fundamental
point
is
it
is
the
burden
of
the
state
to
show
that
in
the
given
circumstances
that
these
were
fighting
words.
that
is
given
the
factual
situation
that
you
described
with
servicemen
around
and
so
on
that
it’s
a
factual
burden
on
the
state
to
show
that
in
those
particular
circumstances
there
was
a
likelihood
of
violence.
no
such
showing
was
made
in
this
case.
beyond
that,
perhaps
i
should
further
elucidate
on
the
possible
distinction
between
oral
and
written.
it
is
certainly
true
that
there
maybe
some
non-speech
interest
that
arise
in
the
connection
with
an
oral
statement
that
may
not
arise
with
the
written
statement.
for
example,
you
spoke
of
him
chanting,
well
if
there
were
a
constant
oral
kind
of
communication
that
became
disturbing
then
regardless
of
the
content
of
the
speech
that
might
be
grounds
for
the
state
moving
in
and
stopping
this.
so
in
that
sense
there
can
be
a
distinction
between
oral
and
verbal
but
i
don’t
make
the
distinction
in
terms
of
the
intellectual
content
of
what
is
said.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
then,
the
california
state
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
defend
the
lower
court
decision
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
a
possibility.
it
might
have
happened
that
there
would
be
violence
despite
the
fact
that
the
settled
statement
clearly
says,
signed
by
the
trial
judge
that
there
was
no
violence
and
no
likelihood
of
violence
either
by
the
appellant
or
by
anyone
hostile
to
him
or
with
him
viewing
him.
and
so
this
was
quite
contrary
to
the
facts
of
the
record.
beyond
that,
quite
apart
from
that,
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
quite
improper
in
view
of
the
carefully
worked
out
doctrine
that
this
court
has
enunciated
through
the
years
about
first
amendment.
note
the
possible
implications
for
example
in
cases
like
edwards
versus
south
carolina,
where
negro
demonstrators
peacefully
present
their
views
at
the
state
house.
now,
one
could
certainly
say
there
that
it
is
possible
given
the
southern
atmosphere
it
is
possible
there
might
be
someone
in
the
audience,
a
white
person
observing,
who
might
resort
to
violence,
that’s
possible.
but
this
court
has
made
very
clear
that
that’s
not
enough
of
a
standard.
the
mere
possibility,
there
must
be
a
likelihood,
a
real
likelihood
and
an
imminence
in
order
to
justify
abridging
freedom
of
speech.
that
standard
was
certainly
not
met
here
and
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
reflect
such
a
standard
here.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
chief
justice
it
is
not
our
position
that
because
it
happens
to
be
profanity,
automatically
there
is
an
absolute
right,
no
your
honor.
we
certainly
recognize
that
in
given
circumstances
the
issuance
of
profanity
may
cause
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
violent
reaction
and
if
that
--
if
those
are
the
circumstances
then
the
profanity
can
be
prohibited.
it
is
also
conceivable
that
in
given
circumstances
the
profanity
will
be
used
in
an
obscenity
setting
as
this
court
has
defined
obscenity.
again,
under
this
court’s
decision
the
first
amendment
would
not
apply.
it
is
also
possible
the
profanity
or
whatever
is
said
maybe
used
in
circumstances
where
the
person
had
no
right
to
be
where
he
was
although
the
adderly
doctrine
and
then
again
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
using
profanity
does
not
give
him
an
absolute
right
to
speak.
but
in
the
situation
where
the
various
contexts
that
this
court
has
found
justify
not
applying
the
first
amendment
where
those
context
do
not
arise
as
they
do
not
arise
here
then
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
happens
to
be
profanity
does
not
justify
the
state
from
coming
in
and
stopping
the
statement.
we
submit
your
honors
that
there
are
very
serious
and
important
first
amendment
implications
here
that
should
be
realized
and
i’d
like
at
this
point
then
to
trace
them.
because
having
passed
the
point
and
i
certainly
would
be
happy
to
come
back
if
any
of
the
court
wishes
on
any
of
these
various
exclusionary
grounds
why
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply.
assuming
that
none
of
those
are
pertained
and
we
submit
they
do
not
as
set
forth
in
the
whole
part
one
of
our
brief.
going
to
part
two
of
our
brief,
why
is
profanity
itself
worthy
of
protection?
well,
one
really
doesn’t
have
to
put
it
in
that
context
because
the
first
amendment
says,
“speech
is
protected.”
you
don’t
have
to
justify
it
on
any
other
ground.
but
let’s
look
for
a
moment
at
the
policy
reasons
which
underlie
the
first
amendment
if
we
may
and
see
why
they
do
apply
in
the
area
of
profanity,
as
well
as
elsewhere.
we
know
that
one
fundamental
reason
as
justice
brandeis
pointed
out
in
his
famous
whitney
concurrence,
one
fundamental
reason
why
free
speech
is
important
is
because
of
its
contribution
to
the
democratic
dialog.
a
self-governing
people
can
govern
wisely
only
if
they
hear
all
material,
all
data
from
all
sources.
and
this
court
made
that
point
again
most
recently
in
the
red
lion
case.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor
,i
understand
the
argument
can
be
made
and
perhaps
you
by
implication
are
making
it.
why
do
they
have
to
use
these
words?
why
couldn’t
he
simply
said,
“i
hate
the
draft”
and
if
put
forward
the
democratic
dialog
equally
as
well?
and
we
have
several
fold
answer
to
that.
first
of
all,
on
a
more
superficial
level
if
you
will,
if
this
appellant
had
used
the
more
laundered
form
of
expression.
if
he
had
said,
“i
hate
the
draft”,
then
the
self-governing
people,
the
people
who
must
make
decisions
based
upon
freedom
of
speech
and
what
they
hear
from
that
freedom
of
speech
would
be
somewhat
less
wise
than
they
are.
now,
what
do
i
mean
by
that?
i
mean
by
that
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
young
man
chose
to
choose
a
word
which
many
people
would
no
doubt
find
disagreeable
and
no
doubt
no
question
of
that.
the
mere
fact
that
he
chose
to
use
that
word
is
important
data
for
the
self-governing
people
to
know,
to
know
that
he
feels
this
deeply
about
this
subject.
if
they
don’t
--
if
you
use
the
laundered
form
of
expression
“i
hate
the
draft”
they
would
have
been
ignorant
to
a
degree.
and
as
dr.
meiklejohn
said
in
his
famous
work,
following
the
brandeis
formula,
the
self-governing
people
must
know
--
have
access
to
all
material
and
all
data.
now
if
they
didn’t
know
about
his
depth
of
feeling
that
was
evidenced
by
this
word
or
knowing
that
what
are
the
consequences?
well
it
--
they
could
be
any
one
of
the
number.
maybe
the
self-governing
people
decide
that
if
that’s
the
attitude
of
the
young
people
the
penalty
for
the
draft
was
made
for
avoiding
the
draft
must
be
made
more
severe.
or
on
the
contrary
it
might
be
repeal
the
draft,
or
any
one
of
the
number
of
other
possibilities.
the
point
is
they
know
somewhat
less
by
the
state
stepping
in
and
changing
that
kind
of
expression.
a
little
more
profoundly
though,
but
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
took
the
jacket
off
because
he
was
wearing
the
jacket
as
one
would
ordinarily
wear
the
jacket,
he
was
somewhat
chilly.
he
knew
that
the
sign
was
on
there
and
he
knew
that
this
showed
the
depth
of
feeling
of
young
man.
but
he
wasn't
there
to
demonstrate
or
parade.
and
that’s
the
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
makes
in
that
course
of
their
opinion,
pardon
me,
says
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
but
your
honor,
he
was
not
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
he
was--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
that
he
knew
--
i
didn’t
hear
the
last.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
perhaps
he
knew
it
would
be
improper
to
wear
it
in
the
courtroom.
i
have
never
questioned
him
on
that
and
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
i
don’t
know.
i’d
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
indeed.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
you’re
quite
right
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
question
is
what
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
because
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
this
does
not
get
into
the
area
of
possible
contempt
of
court.
this
is
an
ordinary
free
--
exercise
in
freedom
of
expression.
certainly,
one
is
not
limited
in
one’s
freedom
of
expression
to
expressing
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
certainly
not.
that
would
have
been
highly
improper
your
honor.
but
that
raises
another
non-speech
element
namely
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
well
your
honor,
it
was
on
his
jacket,
which
meant
that
a
person
if
he
wishes
to
could
see
it
on
his
jacket,
but
the
person
was
not
forced
to
continue
to
observe
that
as
in
terms
of
a
loud
noise
one
can’t
help
but
hear
it.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
for
the
moment
but
there
--
but
for
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
no.
and
i’m
certainly
not
stating
that
at
all.
quite
definitely
he
did
want
to
pass
that
message,
but
it’s
a
somewhat
different
question,
one,
what
his
motive
was
in
wearing
it
and
in
part
it
was
to
convey
this
message
although
he
was
not
parading
or
picketing
or
anything
of
the
sort.
he
was
making
his
way
to
the
courtroom
and
then
made
his
way
back.
but
he
did
want
people
to
see
this.
on
the
other
hand,
it’s
a
different
question
to
conclude
whether
or
not
people
have
to
see
it
for
any
considerable
period
of
time
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
was
not
necessary
in
the
circumstances.
it
is
true
that
some
people
momentarily
probably
couldn’t
avoid
seeing
it.
but
there
was
no
continuing
requirement
at
all
and
that
gets
to
this
captive
audience
doctrine,
it
was
of
the
kind
of
fleeting
contact
as
one
has,
if
one
walks
through
a
hyde
park
type
area
where
you
may
hear
fleetingly
offensive
sounds
but
they
are
no
more
than
fleeting.
well,
i
started
to
get
to
what
i
--
if
i
may,
--
what
i
think
is
the
more
profound
reason
why
this
court
must
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
goes
not
only
to
offensive
content.
and
certainly
this
court
has
made
clear
over
and
over
again
that
no
matter
how
offensive
the
idea
conveyed
its
still
is
protected.
the
writings
of
adolf
hitler
and
joseph
stalin
certainly
are
far
more
offensive
to
many
people
than
the
word
before
this
court
and
this
case
that
appears
in
7
out
of
10
of
the
best
selling
works
of
1969,
as
indicated
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
certainly,
offensiveness
per
se
does
not
derogate
from
the
right
to
speak
under
the
first
amendment.
but
then
the
question
comes
back
what
about
the
form
of
the
offense?
if
the
offensiveness
comes
in
form
rather
than
in
substance,
and
i
have
made
one
point
on
that
knowing
the
depth
of
the
feeling,
this
is
data
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
know.
there’s
a
more
profound
point
if
i
may
and
that
is,
linguists
tell
us
that
language
performs
two
functions,
there
is
the
emotive
content
of
the
language
and
there
is
the
intellectual
content
of
language
and
that
these
intersperse.
that
is
the
intellectual
content
is
that
which
carries
the
message
per
se.
the
emotive
content
of
language
is
that
which
persuades
we
are
all
human
beings,
we
are
all
moved
to
a
degree
by
emotional
considerations,
as
well
as
by
intellectual
considerations.
and
then
emotive
content
is
also
important.
now
we
get
to
what
the
first
amendment
is
all
about.
and
what
it
is
all
about
of
course
is
competition
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
what
ideas
are
going
to
prevail.
we
subscribe
to
the
democratic
faith
that
the
ideas
that
prevail
by
a
majority
are
the
ideas
which
should
be
followed.
but
in
order
for
that
system
to
work,
it’s
important
that
the
state
not
step
in
and
try
to
censor
either
emotive
content
or
intellectual
content
because
depending
on
the
emotive
content,
particular
emotive
content
it
will
appeal,
the
message
will
appeal
to
various
groups
of
citizens.
and
by
determining
what
the
emotive
--
by
censoring
the
emotive
content
even
if
not
the
intellectual
content,
the
state
is
thereby
enabled
to
a
great
degree
to
determine
what
group
will
buy
this
idea,
to
what
group
this
idea
will
appeal.
and
hence,
ultimately
we’ll
be
able
to
determine
what
ideas
prevail
in
the
competition
of
the
market.
and
so
for
that
reason
we
submit
to
the
court
respectfully
that
emotive
content
just
as
much
as
intellectual
content
or
to
put
it
on
other
way
that
the
four
offensiveness
of
form
no
less
than
offensiveness
of
substance
must
be
preserved
by
the
first
amendment
if
the
first
amendment
is
to
be
meaningful.
now,
i
should
like
to
if
i
may
with
the
court’s
permission
point
out
one
other
aspect.
and
that
has
to
do
with
this
hostile
audience
veto
that
was
referred
to
a
little
bit
in
the
last
case.
this
is
another
element
that
comes
into
play
in
this
case.
the
court
could
decide
the
decision
here
without
deciding
that.
we
submit
it
would
be
both
proper
and
desirable
for
the
court
to
get
into
this
issue.
what
that
has
to
do
with
is
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
saying
there
was
a
likelihood
of
violence
not
from
those
who
were
followers
of
the
defendant
here
but
from
those
who
were
hostile
to
what
he
had
to
say,
they
might
resort
to
violence.
and
the
question
is
posed
even
if
there
was
such
a
likelihood
or
even
if
a
mere
tendency
is
a
sufficient
standard,
is
it
enough
to
put
down
the
speaker
because
those
who
dislike
what
he
says
may
resort
to
violence.
as
professor
chasey
(ph)
said,
as
quoted
more
accurately
in
my
brief,
but
does
a
man
have
to
--
can
a
man
be
arrested
because
his
neighbors
don’t
have
enough
self-control
to
stop
themselves
when
they
see
--
when
they
hear
something
or
read
something
they
don’t
like.
we
suggest
that
the
time
has
come
when
this
court
should
make
very
clear
as
it
has
in
part
in
edwards
and
in
cox
that
a
hostile
audience
at
least
if
the
police
can
control
the
hostile
audience
is
not
sufficient
to
stop
the
speaker.
this
becomes
a
very
current
issue
on
college
campuses
today
where
many
members
of
the
government
and
other
established
people
cannot
go
on
campus
because
the
college
audiences
are
sufficiently
hostile
so
that
they
attempt
by
sometimes
by
violent
acts
to
stop
the
speaker.
this
is
wrong.
this
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
and
this
is
the
time
for
this
court
to
say
so.
there
was
a
case,
a
lower
court
case
cited
in
our
brief
in
stacy
versus
williams
in
which
precisely
that
issue
pertaining
to
the
college
campus
was
decided
by
a
federal
district
court
in
mississippi,
overruling
a
state
regulation
stating
that
if
--
that
a
speaker
might
not
come
on
a
college
campus,
if
there
is
a
likelihood
that
the
students
will
resort
to
violence.
the
court
said
“not
so.
the
police
must
put
down
the
mob,
not
the
speaker.”
well
that
too
is
involved
in
this
case
and
we
submit
that
this
is
an
opportunity
for
this
court
to
make
clear
the
nature
of
free
speech
for
students,
as
well
as
for
others.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
your
honor,
several
points
if
i
may
mr.
justice
blackmun.
first
of
all
it’s
to
be
noted
that
the
bushman
case
further
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court,
the
very
statute
we
have
here,
but
it
occurred
after
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
after
the
california
supreme
court
refused
to
hear
our
case
then
the
bushman
case
per
--
mr.
chief
justice
treanor
construed
section
415
and
the
offensive
conduct.
now
that
construction
is
somewhat
ambiguous
it
seems
to
me
because
part
of
the
opinion
speaks
of
the
requirement
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
offensive
conduct
will
produce
violence.
elsewhere,
the
opinion
speaks
of
a
tendency
to
produce
violence.
and
so
on
the
very
issue
i
have
suggested
i
think
there
is
some
ambiguity.
beyond
that
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
bushman
cites
this
case,
cohen,
as
standing
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
violence
here.
well,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
and
--
to
the
contrary
there
is
in
the
settled
statement,
page
20
of
the
appendix,
a
statement
directly
countering
that.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor
i
have
to
conclude
that
the
california
supreme
court
approved
the
holding
because
they
cited
apparently
with
approval
the
cohen
case
as
standing
for
the
correct
proposition
namely
that
there
must
be
a
likelihood
of
violence
in
order
to
justify
convicting
a
speaker
for
the
use
of
words
under
the
offensive
conduct,
section
415.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
i
think
it
comes
a
lot
closer
to
meeting
it
than
does
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case.
i
would
still
suggest
with
respect
your
honor
that
it
does
not
meet
federal
standards
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
because
it
is
ambiguous
as
i
say
on
the
question
of
whether
on
the
one
hand
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
violence
arising
from
the
words
which
constitute
offensive
conduct
or
whether
there
need
merely
be
a
tendency,
that's
one
point.
second
point
is,
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
bushman
in
no
way
goes
into
this
hostile
audience
doctrine
indicating
that
the
statute
would
not
apply
if
the
likelihood
of
violence
arises
from
a
hostile
audience.
and
indeed,
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
davis,
which
is
cited
in
appellee’s
brief
took
the
contrary
position,
not
on
the
same
statute
but
on
anti-riot
statute
saying
that
“even
if
the
danger
comes
from
a
hostile
audience
that’s
still
enough
to
abridge
the
speech.”
so
the
suggestion
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
does
not
recognize
that
doctrine.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
certainly
do
not
your
honor.
first
of
all
of
course
it
would
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
look
at
the
bushman
opinion
and
see
the
california
supreme
court
citation
of
cohen
as
having
been
correctly
decided
and
there
would
be
nothing
further
for
them
to
do
but
reaffirm.
and
then
perhaps
ultimately
it
would
come
back
here
again.
it
would
simply
be
a
delay
if
the
court
is
of
the
view
that
there
were
improper
standards
applied
by
the
lower
courts
in
california.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
if
he
wore
the
jacket
in
the
courtroom
during
courtroom
proceedings
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
i
should
further
qualify
that.
i
could
then
see
the
possibility
of
a
charge
on
contempt.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
would
still
say
it
would
be
a
proper
to
charge
him
under
this
statute.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
well,
i’m
only
looking
at
the
possibility.
there
i
could
see
the
possibility
of
the
court
concluding
that
the
use
of
that
word
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
so
interfering
with
the
decorum
of
the
courtroom
that
it
did
create
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
interfering
with
justice.
now,
i’m
only
perhaps
taking
a
devil’s
advocate
there.
i
can
see
that
as
a
possibility
but
even
if
it
is
a
possibility
it
is
not
this
case.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
perhaps
not
your
honor.
the
courtroom
is
no
place
to
go
around
making
speeches
either
written
or
verbal
during
trial
proceedings.
your
honor,
does
that
mean
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
don’t
have
any
rebuttal
time?
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
comments
simply
about
taking
off
from
mr.
sauer
said
about
the
number
of
arrest
that
have
occurred.
actually
if
you
look
at
the
amicus
brief
of
the
aclu
of
northern
california
in
this
case
there
is
a
suggestion
there
are
numerous
arrests
all
over
the
country
all
the
time
for
this
kind
of
offense,
and
particularly
relating
to
minority
groups
where
no
charge
is
made
against
the
minority
person
other
than
that
he
engaged
--
he
uttered
something
that
it
was
offensive.
now
sometimes
it
may
be
fighting
words
but
not
necessarily.
sometimes
that
is
--
it
may
be
a
preliminary
to
violence.
but
even
if
it’s
not
this
kind
of
thing
occurs
and
that
gets
me
with
the
final
point
is,
the
point
made
by
the
aclu
amicus
brief
of
northern
california,
where
they
suggest
that
this
court
may
decide
this
case
under
a
narrow
grounds.
and
of
course
we
agree
on
the
narrow
grounds
suggested
by
them
that
the
--
and
i
won’t
repeat
them
because
of
lack
of
time.
but
may
i
close
your
honors
with
the
suggestion
that
if
this
case
is
decided
for
our
side
on
narrow
grounds,
what
it
will
mean
is
it
will
continue
to
be
the
fact
that
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
all
over
the
country
are
arrested
because
they
simply
have
used
a
word
that
others
find
offensive
in
this
profanity
area
where
there
is
no
likelihood
of
violence.
we
suggest
your
honors
that
just
as
the
basic
underlying
theory
of
the
doctrine
of
over
breadth
in
order
to
avoid
a
chilling
effect,
you
decide
a
case
even
though
you
could
decide
it
more
narrowly
in
order
to
avoid
the
chilling
effect
on
those
not
before
the
court
then
it
would
be
particularly
appropriate
for
this
court
in
this
decision,
if
it
does
decide
that
there
should
be
a
reversal
to
go
further
and
make
clear
that
the
language
of
profanity
is
not
outside
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment,
simply
because
it’s
offensive.
it
may
be
outside
in
given
circumstances
where
it
is
a
preliminary
to
violence
or
where
there
are
other
specific
other
grounds.
but
simply
because
it
is
offensive
it
should
be
made
clear
this
is
within
the
first
amendment.
and
one
other
point,
final
point
on
the
hostile
audience
doctrine,
again
to
make
clear
to
college
students
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
engaging
in
dissent
in
such
a
way
that
you
don’t
like
it
and
engaging
in
dissent
as
to
put
down
the
speaker,
that
too
is
outside
the
bounds
of
the
first
amendment
and
this
court
could
make
that
clear.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
of
course
here
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
state
of
california
upon
this
court’s
order
postponing
jurisdiction
pending
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
chief
justice’s
suggestion
i
certainly
will
keep
very
brief
this
statement
of
facts,
but
fundamentally
we
do
have
here
the
appellant
charged
and
convicted
of
engaging
in
tumultuous
and
offensive
conduct
in
violation
of
the
california
disturbing
the
peace
statute
penal
code
section
415.
although
there
was
a
reversal
upon
the
first
level
of
appeal,
appellant
affirmed
the
superior
of
court,
it
was
then
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
vacated
and
affirmed
the
judgment.
california
supreme
court
refused
the
hearing,
four-to-three
decision
on
that.
and
of
course
fundamentally,
may
it
please
the
court
what
this
young
man
did
was
to
walk
through
a
courthouse
corridor
in
los
angeles
county
on
his
way
to
a
courtroom
where
he
had
some
business.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
blackmun,
he
was
--
although
it’s
not
on
the
record
the
fact
is
he
was
called
there
as
a
witness
in
a
case
which
he
was
not
involved
in
himself.
while
walking
through
that
corridor
he
was
wearing
a
jacket
upon
which
were
inscribed
the
words
“fuck
the
draft”,
also
were
inscribed
the
words
“stop
war”
and
several
peace
symbols.
when
he
entered
the
courtroom,
he
took
off
his
jacket
and
held
it
folded.
when
he
left
the
courtroom,
he
was
arrested
for
disturbing
the
peace,
specifically
engaging
in
tumultuous
and
offensive
conduct.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
held
it
folded
over
his
arm
and
it
was
not
on
view
there.
furthermore,
the
policeman
who
observed
him
walking
through
the
corridor
before
he
went
into
the
courtroom
--
this
is
in
the
record,
requested
the
judge
in
courtroom
to
hold
the
young
man
in
contempt.
the
judge
refused
to
hold
the
young
man
in
contempt
because
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
in
the
courtroom.
i
shouldn’t
say
that,
i
don’t
know
what
he
would
have
done
if
he
did
see
anything.
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen.
and
then
he
left
and
at
that
point
he
was
arrested.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
precisely
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
exactly
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that’s
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
think
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
think
there
are
some
things
that
in
the
courtroom
itself,
while
court
is
in
session
would
be
improper
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
don’t
think
that
arises
in
this
case.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
i
was
making
the
distinction
here
hypothetically
something
had
occurred
in
the
courtroom
while
court
was
in
session
it
might
be
a
different
case.
that
is
not
that
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor
as
far
as
the
record
indicate
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
when
you
get
into
the
question
of
contempt,
which
that
really
raises
this
court’s
standard
that
has
been
adopted
in
numerous
cases
namely
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
speech
creates
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
interference
with
a
judicial
process
would
apply
and
conceivably
and
given
facts
where
those
words
do
appear
during
session
of
the
court
not
merely
in
the
physical
courtroom
but
while
court
is
in
session.
conceivably
that
would
apply
but
that
is
not
this
case
with
all
respect
your
honor.
so
that
this
young
man
was
arrested
while
walking
in
the
corridor
and
i
think
it
is
vital
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
it
is
in
the
los
angeles
county
courthouse
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
it
is,
yes
it
is
a
very
large
one.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
something
like
that
your
honor,
yes.
it
incidentally
is
not
a
courtroom
where
draft
cases
are
tried,
it’s
not
the
federal
court
it’s
the
state
courts.
well,
i
think
it’s
important
at
the
outset
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
violence,
no
component
of
violence
present.
it
is
stated
in
the
settled
statements
signed
by
the
trial
judge
that
the
appellant
did
not
engage
in
violence,
did
not
threaten
violence,
that
no
one
observing
him
engaged
in
violence
or
threat
in
violence.
so
the
violence
component
is
completely
out
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
terribly
significant
for
the
significance
the
broader
significance
of
this
case.
pointing
out
as
it
does
as
it
can
do
depending
on
this
court’s
decision
the
very
vital
distinction
between
dissent
which
may
be
offensive
to
people,
some
people
may
not
like
it
but
non
violent
dissent
and
violent
dissent
--
a
distinction
that
all
too
often
are
younger
--
members
of
the
younger
generation
tend
to
forget.
they
tend
to
equate
violent
dissent
and
dissent
that
may
be
regarded
as
objectionable
or
offensive.
it
is
terribly
important
we
submit
your
honors
that
this
court
may
clear
that
distinction,
that
dissent
by
its
very
nature
involves
the
right
to
be
offensive
if
non-offensive
dissent
is
almost
a
contradiction
in
terms.
because
if
it’s
not
offensive
it
means
you
agree
with
it.
but
on
the
other
hand
violent
dissent
is
something
quite
different.
and
this
--
the
facts
this
case
point
out
precisely
that
distinction,
yet
the
trial
court,
first
of
all,
erroneously
we
submit
quite
clearly
erroneously,
rule
that
it
was
completely
unnecessary
to
show
any
component
of
violence
in
connection
with
the
statute.
and
that
set
forth,
i
think
at
appendix
19
where
they
said
--
the
trial
judge
said,
“simply
if
it’s
offensive
that’s
enough.”
and
we
submit
that
that
clearly
is
unconstitutional
given
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
beyond
that
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
came
to
rule
in
this
case
and
affirmed
the
decision
below
was
not
prepared
to
go
that
far
indicated
that
there
wasn’t
necessity
for
a
violence
component.
but
it’s
very
interesting
to
note
the
way
they
handled
that.
what
they
said
was,
first
they
quoted
appellant’s
position
that
there
must
be
a
likelihood
of
violence
arising
from
offensive
conduct.
and
the
courts
--
the
court
of
appeals,
state
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
the
beginning
says,
“that’s
right.
we
subscribe
to
that
view.
there
must
be
a
likelihood
of
violence
arising
from
the
offensive
conduct.”
but
then
on
the
course
of
the
opinion
they
go
on
to
say,
“it’s
sufficient
if
there’s
a
tendency
to
violence
if
a
violent
act
might
occur.”
and
then
they
say,
“this
might
occur”
because
a
man
walking
with
his
wife
and
children
seeing
this
words
on
the
jacket
“might
emphasize”,
it
was
my
emphasis,
might
resort
to
violence
to
attack
this
man
who
was
exhibiting
this
word
that
is
found
offensive.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
white
i
don’t
think
the
distinction
lies
on
whether
it’s
oral
or
written.
but
if
you
are
suggesting
the
distinction
based
upon
the
fighting
words
concept
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
what?
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes.
if
you
use
these
precise
words
namely
relating
to
the
draft.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
don’t
offhand
see
a
viable
distinction
between
the
written
and
the
oral,
yes.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
but
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
terribly
important
to
suggest,
perhaps
you
were
not
suggesting,
but
it
could
suggest
to
me
this
line
of
fighting
--
the
fighting
words
concept
taken
from
the
chaplinsky
case
decided
by
this
court
some
years
ago.
where
this
court
suggested
that
in
certain
circumstances,
words
may
be
regarded
as
fighting
words
because
men
will
reasonably
know
that
they
will
result
in
violence
and
hence
that
those
words
are
outside
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
no
your
honor.
that’s
precisely
my
point
i
think
they’re
synonymous.
and
hence,
these
are
not
fighting
words
because
they’re
--
well
perhaps
i
should
be
more
specific.
insulting
words,
insulting
the
hearer,
insulting
the
word
--
the
person
to
whom
the
words
are
addressed
is
what
the
basic
concept
of
fighting
words
refers
to,
as
in
chaplinsky,
“dammed,
racketeer
and
fascist.”
here,
there
was
no
attack
of
the
hearer.
there
was
an
opposition
verbal
attack
if
you
will
on
an
institution,
the
selective
service
system
but
not
as
against
any
of
the
viewers
of
this
side.
hence,
we
submit
this
does
not
at
all
come
under
the
chaplinsky
fighting
words
concept.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all
in
terms
of
the
fighting
words
i
don’t
see
any
likelihood
to
the
facts
constituting
those
fighting
words.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
the
fundamental
point
is
it
is
the
burden
of
the
state
to
show
that
in
the
given
circumstances
that
these
were
fighting
words.
that
is
given
the
factual
situation
that
you
described
with
servicemen
around
and
so
on
that
it’s
a
factual
burden
on
the
state
to
show
that
in
those
particular
circumstances
there
was
a
likelihood
of
violence.
no
such
showing
was
made
in
this
case.
beyond
that,
perhaps
i
should
further
elucidate
on
the
possible
distinction
between
oral
and
written.
it
is
certainly
true
that
there
maybe
some
non-speech
interest
that
arise
in
the
connection
with
an
oral
statement
that
may
not
arise
with
the
written
statement.
for
example,
you
spoke
of
him
chanting,
well
if
there
were
a
constant
oral
kind
of
communication
that
became
disturbing
then
regardless
of
the
content
of
the
speech
that
might
be
grounds
for
the
state
moving
in
and
stopping
this.
so
in
that
sense
there
can
be
a
distinction
between
oral
and
verbal
but
i
don’t
make
the
distinction
in
terms
of
the
intellectual
content
of
what
is
said.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
then,
the
california
state
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
defend
the
lower
court
decision
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
a
possibility.
it
might
have
happened
that
there
would
be
violence
despite
the
fact
that
the
settled
statement
clearly
says,
signed
by
the
trial
judge
that
there
was
no
violence
and
no
likelihood
of
violence
either
by
the
appellant
or
by
anyone
hostile
to
him
or
with
him
viewing
him.
and
so
this
was
quite
contrary
to
the
facts
of
the
record.
beyond
that,
quite
apart
from
that,
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
quite
improper
in
view
of
the
carefully
worked
out
doctrine
that
this
court
has
enunciated
through
the
years
about
first
amendment.
note
the
possible
implications
for
example
in
cases
like
edwards
versus
south
carolina,
where
negro
demonstrators
peacefully
present
their
views
at
the
state
house.
now,
one
could
certainly
say
there
that
it
is
possible
given
the
southern
atmosphere
it
is
possible
there
might
be
someone
in
the
audience,
a
white
person
observing,
who
might
resort
to
violence,
that’s
possible.
but
this
court
has
made
very
clear
that
that’s
not
enough
of
a
standard.
the
mere
possibility,
there
must
be
a
likelihood,
a
real
likelihood
and
an
imminence
in
order
to
justify
abridging
freedom
of
speech.
that
standard
was
certainly
not
met
here
and
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
reflect
such
a
standard
here.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
chief
justice
it
is
not
our
position
that
because
it
happens
to
be
profanity,
automatically
there
is
an
absolute
right,
no
your
honor.
we
certainly
recognize
that
in
given
circumstances
the
issuance
of
profanity
may
cause
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
violent
reaction
and
if
that
--
if
those
are
the
circumstances
then
the
profanity
can
be
prohibited.
it
is
also
conceivable
that
in
given
circumstances
the
profanity
will
be
used
in
an
obscenity
setting
as
this
court
has
defined
obscenity.
again,
under
this
court’s
decision
the
first
amendment
would
not
apply.
it
is
also
possible
the
profanity
or
whatever
is
said
maybe
used
in
circumstances
where
the
person
had
no
right
to
be
where
he
was
although
the
adderly
doctrine
and
then
again
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
using
profanity
does
not
give
him
an
absolute
right
to
speak.
but
in
the
situation
where
the
various
contexts
that
this
court
has
found
justify
not
applying
the
first
amendment
where
those
context
do
not
arise
as
they
do
not
arise
here
then
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
happens
to
be
profanity
does
not
justify
the
state
from
coming
in
and
stopping
the
statement.
we
submit
your
honors
that
there
are
very
serious
and
important
first
amendment
implications
here
that
should
be
realized
and
i’d
like
at
this
point
then
to
trace
them.
because
having
passed
the
point
and
i
certainly
would
be
happy
to
come
back
if
any
of
the
court
wishes
on
any
of
these
various
exclusionary
grounds
why
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply.
assuming
that
none
of
those
are
pertained
and
we
submit
they
do
not
as
set
forth
in
the
whole
part
one
of
our
brief.
going
to
part
two
of
our
brief,
why
is
profanity
itself
worthy
of
protection?
well,
one
really
doesn’t
have
to
put
it
in
that
context
because
the
first
amendment
says,
“speech
is
protected.”
you
don’t
have
to
justify
it
on
any
other
ground.
but
let’s
look
for
a
moment
at
the
policy
reasons
which
underlie
the
first
amendment
if
we
may
and
see
why
they
do
apply
in
the
area
of
profanity,
as
well
as
elsewhere.
we
know
that
one
fundamental
reason
as
justice
brandeis
pointed
out
in
his
famous
whitney
concurrence,
one
fundamental
reason
why
free
speech
is
important
is
because
of
its
contribution
to
the
democratic
dialog.
a
self-governing
people
can
govern
wisely
only
if
they
hear
all
material,
all
data
from
all
sources.
and
this
court
made
that
point
again
most
recently
in
the
red
lion
case.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor
,i
understand
the
argument
can
be
made
and
perhaps
you
by
implication
are
making
it.
why
do
they
have
to
use
these
words?
why
couldn’t
he
simply
said,
“i
hate
the
draft”
and
if
put
forward
the
democratic
dialog
equally
as
well?
and
we
have
several
fold
answer
to
that.
first
of
all,
on
a
more
superficial
level
if
you
will,
if
this
appellant
had
used
the
more
laundered
form
of
expression.
if
he
had
said,
“i
hate
the
draft”,
then
the
self-governing
people,
the
people
who
must
make
decisions
based
upon
freedom
of
speech
and
what
they
hear
from
that
freedom
of
speech
would
be
somewhat
less
wise
than
they
are.
now,
what
do
i
mean
by
that?
i
mean
by
that
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
young
man
chose
to
choose
a
word
which
many
people
would
no
doubt
find
disagreeable
and
no
doubt
no
question
of
that.
the
mere
fact
that
he
chose
to
use
that
word
is
important
data
for
the
self-governing
people
to
know,
to
know
that
he
feels
this
deeply
about
this
subject.
if
they
don’t
--
if
you
use
the
laundered
form
of
expression
“i
hate
the
draft”
they
would
have
been
ignorant
to
a
degree.
and
as
dr.
meiklejohn
said
in
his
famous
work,
following
the
brandeis
formula,
the
self-governing
people
must
know
--
have
access
to
all
material
and
all
data.
now
if
they
didn’t
know
about
his
depth
of
feeling
that
was
evidenced
by
this
word
or
knowing
that
what
are
the
consequences?
well
it
--
they
could
be
any
one
of
the
number.
maybe
the
self-governing
people
decide
that
if
that’s
the
attitude
of
the
young
people
the
penalty
for
the
draft
was
made
for
avoiding
the
draft
must
be
made
more
severe.
or
on
the
contrary
it
might
be
repeal
the
draft,
or
any
one
of
the
number
of
other
possibilities.
the
point
is
they
know
somewhat
less
by
the
state
stepping
in
and
changing
that
kind
of
expression.
a
little
more
profoundly
though,
but
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
took
the
jacket
off
because
he
was
wearing
the
jacket
as
one
would
ordinarily
wear
the
jacket,
he
was
somewhat
chilly.
he
knew
that
the
sign
was
on
there
and
he
knew
that
this
showed
the
depth
of
feeling
of
young
man.
but
he
wasn't
there
to
demonstrate
or
parade.
and
that’s
the
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
makes
in
that
course
of
their
opinion,
pardon
me,
says
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
but
your
honor,
he
was
not
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
he
was--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
that
he
knew
--
i
didn’t
hear
the
last.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
perhaps
he
knew
it
would
be
improper
to
wear
it
in
the
courtroom.
i
have
never
questioned
him
on
that
and
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
i
don’t
know.
i’d
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
indeed.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
you’re
quite
right
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
question
is
what
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
because
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
this
does
not
get
into
the
area
of
possible
contempt
of
court.
this
is
an
ordinary
free
--
exercise
in
freedom
of
expression.
certainly,
one
is
not
limited
in
one’s
freedom
of
expression
to
expressing
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
certainly
not.
that
would
have
been
highly
improper
your
honor.
but
that
raises
another
non-speech
element
namely
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
well
your
honor,
it
was
on
his
jacket,
which
meant
that
a
person
if
he
wishes
to
could
see
it
on
his
jacket,
but
the
person
was
not
forced
to
continue
to
observe
that
as
in
terms
of
a
loud
noise
one
can’t
help
but
hear
it.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
for
the
moment
but
there
--
but
for
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
no.
and
i’m
certainly
not
stating
that
at
all.
quite
definitely
he
did
want
to
pass
that
message,
but
it’s
a
somewhat
different
question,
one,
what
his
motive
was
in
wearing
it
and
in
part
it
was
to
convey
this
message
although
he
was
not
parading
or
picketing
or
anything
of
the
sort.
he
was
making
his
way
to
the
courtroom
and
then
made
his
way
back.
but
he
did
want
people
to
see
this.
on
the
other
hand,
it’s
a
different
question
to
conclude
whether
or
not
people
have
to
see
it
for
any
considerable
period
of
time
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
was
not
necessary
in
the
circumstances.
it
is
true
that
some
people
momentarily
probably
couldn’t
avoid
seeing
it.
but
there
was
no
continuing
requirement
at
all
and
that
gets
to
this
captive
audience
doctrine,
it
was
of
the
kind
of
fleeting
contact
as
one
has,
if
one
walks
through
a
hyde
park
type
area
where
you
may
hear
fleetingly
offensive
sounds
but
they
are
no
more
than
fleeting.
well,
i
started
to
get
to
what
i
--
if
i
may,
--
what
i
think
is
the
more
profound
reason
why
this
court
must
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
goes
not
only
to
offensive
content.
and
certainly
this
court
has
made
clear
over
and
over
again
that
no
matter
how
offensive
the
idea
conveyed
its
still
is
protected.
the
writings
of
adolf
hitler
and
joseph
stalin
certainly
are
far
more
offensive
to
many
people
than
the
word
before
this
court
and
this
case
that
appears
in
7
out
of
10
of
the
best
selling
works
of
1969,
as
indicated
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
certainly,
offensiveness
per
se
does
not
derogate
from
the
right
to
speak
under
the
first
amendment.
but
then
the
question
comes
back
what
about
the
form
of
the
offense?
if
the
offensiveness
comes
in
form
rather
than
in
substance,
and
i
have
made
one
point
on
that
knowing
the
depth
of
the
feeling,
this
is
data
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
know.
there’s
a
more
profound
point
if
i
may
and
that
is,
linguists
tell
us
that
language
performs
two
functions,
there
is
the
emotive
content
of
the
language
and
there
is
the
intellectual
content
of
language
and
that
these
intersperse.
that
is
the
intellectual
content
is
that
which
carries
the
message
per
se.
the
emotive
content
of
language
is
that
which
persuades
we
are
all
human
beings,
we
are
all
moved
to
a
degree
by
emotional
considerations,
as
well
as
by
intellectual
considerations.
and
then
emotive
content
is
also
important.
now
we
get
to
what
the
first
amendment
is
all
about.
and
what
it
is
all
about
of
course
is
competition
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
what
ideas
are
going
to
prevail.
we
subscribe
to
the
democratic
faith
that
the
ideas
that
prevail
by
a
majority
are
the
ideas
which
should
be
followed.
but
in
order
for
that
system
to
work,
it’s
important
that
the
state
not
step
in
and
try
to
censor
either
emotive
content
or
intellectual
content
because
depending
on
the
emotive
content,
particular
emotive
content
it
will
appeal,
the
message
will
appeal
to
various
groups
of
citizens.
and
by
determining
what
the
emotive
--
by
censoring
the
emotive
content
even
if
not
the
intellectual
content,
the
state
is
thereby
enabled
to
a
great
degree
to
determine
what
group
will
buy
this
idea,
to
what
group
this
idea
will
appeal.
and
hence,
ultimately
we’ll
be
able
to
determine
what
ideas
prevail
in
the
competition
of
the
market.
and
so
for
that
reason
we
submit
to
the
court
respectfully
that
emotive
content
just
as
much
as
intellectual
content
or
to
put
it
on
other
way
that
the
four
offensiveness
of
form
no
less
than
offensiveness
of
substance
must
be
preserved
by
the
first
amendment
if
the
first
amendment
is
to
be
meaningful.
now,
i
should
like
to
if
i
may
with
the
court’s
permission
point
out
one
other
aspect.
and
that
has
to
do
with
this
hostile
audience
veto
that
was
referred
to
a
little
bit
in
the
last
case.
this
is
another
element
that
comes
into
play
in
this
case.
the
court
could
decide
the
decision
here
without
deciding
that.
we
submit
it
would
be
both
proper
and
desirable
for
the
court
to
get
into
this
issue.
what
that
has
to
do
with
is
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
saying
there
was
a
likelihood
of
violence
not
from
those
who
were
followers
of
the
defendant
here
but
from
those
who
were
hostile
to
what
he
had
to
say,
they
might
resort
to
violence.
and
the
question
is
posed
even
if
there
was
such
a
likelihood
or
even
if
a
mere
tendency
is
a
sufficient
standard,
is
it
enough
to
put
down
the
speaker
because
those
who
dislike
what
he
says
may
resort
to
violence.
as
professor
chasey
(ph)
said,
as
quoted
more
accurately
in
my
brief,
but
does
a
man
have
to
--
can
a
man
be
arrested
because
his
neighbors
don’t
have
enough
self-control
to
stop
themselves
when
they
see
--
when
they
hear
something
or
read
something
they
don’t
like.
we
suggest
that
the
time
has
come
when
this
court
should
make
very
clear
as
it
has
in
part
in
edwards
and
in
cox
that
a
hostile
audience
at
least
if
the
police
can
control
the
hostile
audience
is
not
sufficient
to
stop
the
speaker.
this
becomes
a
very
current
issue
on
college
campuses
today
where
many
members
of
the
government
and
other
established
people
cannot
go
on
campus
because
the
college
audiences
are
sufficiently
hostile
so
that
they
attempt
by
sometimes
by
violent
acts
to
stop
the
speaker.
this
is
wrong.
this
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
and
this
is
the
time
for
this
court
to
say
so.
there
was
a
case,
a
lower
court
case
cited
in
our
brief
in
stacy
versus
williams
in
which
precisely
that
issue
pertaining
to
the
college
campus
was
decided
by
a
federal
district
court
in
mississippi,
overruling
a
state
regulation
stating
that
if
--
that
a
speaker
might
not
come
on
a
college
campus,
if
there
is
a
likelihood
that
the
students
will
resort
to
violence.
the
court
said
“not
so.
the
police
must
put
down
the
mob,
not
the
speaker.”
well
that
too
is
involved
in
this
case
and
we
submit
that
this
is
an
opportunity
for
this
court
to
make
clear
the
nature
of
free
speech
for
students,
as
well
as
for
others.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
yes
your
honor,
several
points
if
i
may
mr.
justice
blackmun.
first
of
all
it’s
to
be
noted
that
the
bushman
case
further
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court,
the
very
statute
we
have
here,
but
it
occurred
after
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
after
the
california
supreme
court
refused
to
hear
our
case
then
the
bushman
case
per
--
mr.
chief
justice
treanor
construed
section
415
and
the
offensive
conduct.
now
that
construction
is
somewhat
ambiguous
it
seems
to
me
because
part
of
the
opinion
speaks
of
the
requirement
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
offensive
conduct
will
produce
violence.
elsewhere,
the
opinion
speaks
of
a
tendency
to
produce
violence.
and
so
on
the
very
issue
i
have
suggested
i
think
there
is
some
ambiguity.
beyond
that
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
bushman
cites
this
case,
cohen,
as
standing
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
violence
here.
well,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
and
--
to
the
contrary
there
is
in
the
settled
statement,
page
20
of
the
appendix,
a
statement
directly
countering
that.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor
i
have
to
conclude
that
the
california
supreme
court
approved
the
holding
because
they
cited
apparently
with
approval
the
cohen
case
as
standing
for
the
correct
proposition
namely
that
there
must
be
a
likelihood
of
violence
in
order
to
justify
convicting
a
speaker
for
the
use
of
words
under
the
offensive
conduct,
section
415.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
i
think
it
comes
a
lot
closer
to
meeting
it
than
does
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case.
i
would
still
suggest
with
respect
your
honor
that
it
does
not
meet
federal
standards
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
because
it
is
ambiguous
as
i
say
on
the
question
of
whether
on
the
one
hand
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
violence
arising
from
the
words
which
constitute
offensive
conduct
or
whether
there
need
merely
be
a
tendency,
that's
one
point.
second
point
is,
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
bushman
in
no
way
goes
into
this
hostile
audience
doctrine
indicating
that
the
statute
would
not
apply
if
the
likelihood
of
violence
arises
from
a
hostile
audience.
and
indeed,
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
davis,
which
is
cited
in
appellee’s
brief
took
the
contrary
position,
not
on
the
same
statute
but
on
anti-riot
statute
saying
that
“even
if
the
danger
comes
from
a
hostile
audience
that’s
still
enough
to
abridge
the
speech.”
so
the
suggestion
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
does
not
recognize
that
doctrine.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
certainly
do
not
your
honor.
first
of
all
of
course
it
would
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
look
at
the
bushman
opinion
and
see
the
california
supreme
court
citation
of
cohen
as
having
been
correctly
decided
and
there
would
be
nothing
further
for
them
to
do
but
reaffirm.
and
then
perhaps
ultimately
it
would
come
back
here
again.
it
would
simply
be
a
delay
if
the
court
is
of
the
view
that
there
were
improper
standards
applied
by
the
lower
courts
in
california.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
if
he
wore
the
jacket
in
the
courtroom
during
courtroom
proceedings
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
your
honor,
i
should
further
qualify
that.
i
could
then
see
the
possibility
of
a
charge
on
contempt.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
i
would
still
say
it
would
be
a
proper
to
charge
him
under
this
statute.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
well,
i’m
only
looking
at
the
possibility.
there
i
could
see
the
possibility
of
the
court
concluding
that
the
use
of
that
word
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
so
interfering
with
the
decorum
of
the
courtroom
that
it
did
create
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
--
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
interfering
with
justice.
now,
i’m
only
perhaps
taking
a
devil’s
advocate
there.
i
can
see
that
as
a
possibility
but
even
if
it
is
a
possibility
it
is
not
this
case.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
perhaps
not
your
honor.
the
courtroom
is
no
place
to
go
around
making
speeches
either
written
or
verbal
during
trial
proceedings.
your
honor,
does
that
mean
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
don’t
have
any
rebuttal
time?
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
melville
b.
nimmer
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
comments
simply
about
taking
off
from
mr.
sauer
said
about
the
number
of
arrest
that
have
occurred.
actually
if
you
look
at
the
amicus
brief
of
the
aclu
of
northern
california
in
this
case
there
is
a
suggestion
there
are
numerous
arrests
all
over
the
country
all
the
time
for
this
kind
of
offense,
and
particularly
relating
to
minority
groups
where
no
charge
is
made
against
the
minority
person
other
than
that
he
engaged
--
he
uttered
something
that
it
was
offensive.
now
sometimes
it
may
be
fighting
words
but
not
necessarily.
sometimes
that
is
--
it
may
be
a
preliminary
to
violence.
but
even
if
it’s
not
this
kind
of
thing
occurs
and
that
gets
me
with
the
final
point
is,
the
point
made
by
the
aclu
amicus
brief
of
northern
california,
where
they
suggest
that
this
court
may
decide
this
case
under
a
narrow
grounds.
and
of
course
we
agree
on
the
narrow
grounds
suggested
by
them
that
the
--
and
i
won’t
repeat
them
because
of
lack
of
time.
but
may
i
close
your
honors
with
the
suggestion
that
if
this
case
is
decided
for
our
side
on
narrow
grounds,
what
it
will
mean
is
it
will
continue
to
be
the
fact
that
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
all
over
the
country
are
arrested
because
they
simply
have
used
a
word
that
others
find
offensive
in
this
profanity
area
where
there
is
no
likelihood
of
violence.
we
suggest
your
honors
that
just
as
the
basic
underlying
theory
of
the
doctrine
of
over
breadth
in
order
to
avoid
a
chilling
effect,
you
decide
a
case
even
though
you
could
decide
it
more
narrowly
in
order
to
avoid
the
chilling
effect
on
those
not
before
the
court
then
it
would
be
particularly
appropriate
for
this
court
in
this
decision,
if
it
does
decide
that
there
should
be
a
reversal
to
go
further
and
make
clear
that
the
language
of
profanity
is
not
outside
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment,
simply
because
it’s
offensive.
it
may
be
outside
in
given
circumstances
where
it
is
a
preliminary
to
violence
or
where
there
are
other
specific
other
grounds.
but
simply
because
it
is
offensive
it
should
be
made
clear
this
is
within
the
first
amendment.
and
one
other
point,
final
point
on
the
hostile
audience
doctrine,
again
to
make
clear
to
college
students
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
engaging
in
dissent
in
such
a
way
that
you
don’t
like
it
and
engaging
in
dissent
as
to
put
down
the
speaker,
that
too
is
outside
the
bounds
of
the
first
amendment
and
this
court
could
make
that
clear.
thank
you
your
honors.
