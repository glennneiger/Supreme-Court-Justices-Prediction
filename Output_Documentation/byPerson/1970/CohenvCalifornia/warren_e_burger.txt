chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
299,
cohen
against
california.
mr.
nimmer
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
i
might
suggest
to
you
that
as
in
most
cases,
the
court’s
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
factual
setting
of
this
case
and
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
i’m
sure
to
dwell
on
the
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
respect
it’s
no
different
is
it
from
what
it
would
be
if
he’d
been
picked
up
out
on
the
street,
in
front
of
the
building
or
in
any
other
public
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
courthouse
atmosphere
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
said
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
he
did
not
wear
this
jacket
in
the
courtroom.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
go
back
to
what
justice
white
was
addressing
himself
to.
you
have
indicated
that
your
case
is
the
same
situation
as
it
would
be
if
he
walked
through
the
courthouse
chanting
or
shouting
these
words.
and
let’s
say
that
you
would
have
a
miscellany
of
people
that
might
include
members
of
draft
boards,
members
of
the
american
legion,
soldiers
from
the
armed
--
members
of
the
armed
forces,
parents
with
young
children,
you
suggest
that
this
might
not
be
fighting
words
in
the
context
of
that
kind
of
an
audience,
potential
audience?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be,
at
least
if
i
follow
you.
what
you’re
really
saying
is
that
this
is
an
absolute
right
under
the
first
amendment
in
the
context
of
either
speaking
it
as
long
as
it
is
not
shouted,
speaking
it
or
carrying
a
picket
sign,
or
having
it
on
a
jacket
in
the
corridor
of
the
courthouse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
the
communicating
dialog
or
discussion
of
public
issues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is.
we’ll
see
if
we
can
do
something
about
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sauer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
speaking
of
it
as
a
violation
independent
of
what
it
might
it
be
with
as
a
contempt
of
the
court
or
an
interference
with
judicial
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
contempt,
i
take
it.

justice
warren
e.

mr.

your
time
is

but

in
light
of
the
fact
the
questions
came
after,
you
had
undertaken
to
submit,
we’ll
give
you
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
