justice
potter
stewart
now,
inside
the
courtroom,
you
say
he
took
the
jacket
off,
and
did
he
put
it
in
a
place
where
it
was
prominently
on
view?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
conviction
rests
basically
upon
his
wearing
it
in
the
courtroom
--
in
the
corridor
of
the
building.
justice
potter
stewart
the
violation
is
just
what?
what
was
he
convicted
of
violating,
a
statute
that
says
--?
justice
potter
stewart
that
person
then
and
there
being
present,
he
then
and
there
engaged
in
tumultuous
and
offensive
conduct,
is
that
--?
justice
potter
stewart
are
those
the
words
we’re
dealing
with
here?
justice
potter
stewart
tumultuous
and
offensive
conduct
with
other
people
present,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
offensive
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
conduct
was
what,
walking
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wearing
it
--
was
it,
the
conduct
was
precisely
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
walking
wasn't
offensive
conduct,
just
the
walking
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
what
was
the
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
displaying?
justice
potter
stewart
the
words?
justice
potter
stewart
that
were
painted
on
or
sown
on
or
whatever
it
was
on
the
jacket.
justice
potter
stewart
the
jacket?
justice
potter
stewart
the
display
of
the
words?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
persons
then
and
there
are
present
under
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
read
in
your
brief
as
to
what
the
statute
says.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
have
so
much
problem
with
the
tumultuous
or
offensive
as
i
do
with
the
--
what
the
conduct
is
here.
justice
potter
stewart
just
displaying
the
words.
that's
all
the

there
is,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we’re
not
talking
about
decibels
here
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
quite
a
different
case.
this
is
displaying
of
message
and
that’s
only
conduct
involved,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
these
words
have
been
“nuts
to
the
draft”,
would
this
case
have
here?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it’s
not
the
--
it
narrows
down
to
this
one
four-letter
word,

that
it?
