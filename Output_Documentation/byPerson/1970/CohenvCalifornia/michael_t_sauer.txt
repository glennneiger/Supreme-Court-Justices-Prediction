mr.
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
issue
developed
appellants
opening
argument
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
difference
whether
the
appellant
wore
it
in
a
courtroom
or
in
a
corridor.
if
the
defendant
were
protesting
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
carried
a
similar
sign,
and
walked
across
the
plaza
up
the
marble
staircase
and
down
the
corridor
here,
i
don’t
think
it’d
be
any
different
if
he
stopped
and
took
his
jacket
off
at
the
corridor
or
if
he
entered
the
courtroom
here
with
the
same
type
of
sign.
i
believe
the
same
violation
would
have
occurred
that
that
would
have
been
engaging
an
offensive
conduct.
or
if
the
man
wore
it
on
a
public
street
i
would
say
the
same
type
of
conviction
should
stand.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
that’s
true
your
honor
but
if
the
man
were
yelling
the
words
--
if
the
man
spoke
them
in
here
just
to
say
to
someone
else
or
spoke
them
out
in
the
hallway
i
would
still
think
it
would
be
a
violation.
if
he
just
said
it
to
someone
next
to
him
who
might
be
offended
by
the
terms
and
might
react
to
the
statement
made
to
him.
whether
the
man
folded
it
over
his
jacket,
we
don’t
know.
it
says
he
went
in
the
courtroom
but
there
is
no
showing
whether
the
court
was
in
session
or
somebody
walked
in
here
at
quarter
to
one
when
the
court
is
still
in
recess
and
had
the
sign.
and
none
of
your
honors
were
on
the
bench
and
no
one
saw
the
sign.
i
would
say
it
would
still
be
a
violation
then.

he
entered
the
courtroom
prior

mr.

our
argument.
say
the
man
was
sitting
here
and
none
of
your
honors
could
see
him.
everybody
else
in
the
courtroom,
say,
might
be
offended
but
i
could
be
having
a
sign
right
now
and
none
of
you
could
see
my
back,
and
the
argument
goes
on
and
say
i
wouldn’t
be
held
in
contempt.
yet
i
would
still
say
it
would
be
a
violation
because
other
people
in
the
place
might
be
offended
by
what
is
going
on.
mr.

mr.

yes.
mr.

right,
that’s
correct.
now
the
statute
in
california
says,
“tumultuous

as
pleaded
in
the
complaint
is
“tumultuous
and”,
but
i
believe
the
opinion
shows
that
we
never
contented
that
it
was

i
believe
we
conceded
it
was
not

barely
offensive.

mr.

that
is
our
contention.
mr.

mr.

the
record
is
devoid

all
i
could
say
is
the
building
is
the
main
courthouse
in
los
angeles
county
that
has
nine
storeys.
he
was
on
the
seventh
storey,
which
it
means
you
can
enter
on
the
first,
the
second,
or
the
fourth.
so
if
he
entered
the
closest
floor
up,
he
would’ve
entered
the
fourth,
he
would’ve
had
to
walk
down
half
a
block
and
then
ridden
up
three
floors.
so,
unless
he
suddenly
produced
the
jacket
out
of
nowhere
he
had
to
walk
at
least
half
a
block.
mr.
michael

we
do
not

present
at

time.
mr.
michael

unfortunately,
the
record
as
it
came
up
does
not
go
into
that.
apparently,
there
were
at
least
three
people
present.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
if
he
said
it
to
someone
who
doesn’t
accept
those
words,
yes,
i
would

that
might

there
is
another
part
of

mr.

mr.

t.
sauer
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
just
said
the
effect
on
the
average
person.
as
i
go
back
and
read
chaplinsky
there’s
no
showing
that
major
browning
(ph)
when
the
man
yelled
at
him
“you
damn
fascist,
you
damn
racketeer”
was
offended
by
the
statement.
there’s
no
showing
that
major
bowering
was
going
to
react
against
them.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
there’s
no
showing.
even
appellant
admits
the
man
was
there
because
just
citizens
who
would
be
present
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no.
i
believe
three
people
saw
it.
there
was
a
sergeant
splaun
(ph),
there
was
someone
named
alexander
and
one
other
person
i
believe
saw
it.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun,
yes.
i
said
the
record
shows
that
there
were
other
individuals
present,
as
well
as
three
specifically
named
individuals.
there
were
women
and
children
present
in
the
corridors.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
i
believe
is
he
was
to
be
a
defense
witness
in
another
case
as
i
understand
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
the
record
doesn’t
show
but
i
would
stipulate
that
he
was
there
as
a
defense
witness
in
another
case
which
this
has
no
bearing
on.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no,
three
people
saw
him
and
they
testified
that
they
had
seen
it
and
that
there
were
women
and
children
present
in
the
corridor.
there
were
at
least
three
people
specifically
named
that
saw
him.
mr.

no
the
three
specifically
named
people
did
see
him.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no.
there’s
no
evidence
of
that.
i
believe
you
have
to
--
if
you
take
offensive
as
defined
in
chaplinsky,
you
have
to
apply
it
as
what
the
average
man
would
think.
and
i
would
say
these
words
would
be
offensive
to
the
average
man.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
then
i
don’t
believe
we
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
then
i
doubt
if
we
would
be
here
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
or
a
word
yes,
i
think
collectively
throughout
the
cases
referred
to
the
three
words.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
the
terms
“offensive”
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
past.
in
feiner
versus
new
york
the
defendant
was
charged
among
other
thing
with
using
offensive
language
conduct
or
behavior,
acting
in
a
manner
so
as
to
be
offensive
to
others.
in
chaplinsky,
the
man
was
charged
with
using
offensive
word.
this
word
has
stood
the
test
of
time
in
the
past.
in
other
cases,
in
beauharnais
and
roth
in
discussing
an
area
of
obscene
speech,
if
these
words
are
determined
of
the
obscene
speech,
the
court,
it
was
said,
certainly
no
one
would
contend
that
obscene
speech
may
be
punished
only
upon
a
showing
of
circumstances
of
a
clear
and
present
danger.
in
roth
and
in
beauharnais,
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
if
someone
used
obscene
speech
in
public
that
would
be
a
sufficient
violation.
when
the
court
agreed
to
take
the
case,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
postponed.
one
of
the
arguments
that
people
made
in
their
brief
would
be
that
this
is
merely
the
state
interpretation
of
its
own
statute.
the
trial
court
found
the
man
guilty
as
charged
with
--
the
only
two
words
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
california
upheld
department
of
superior
court
held
that
term
“tumultuous
or
offensive”
they
said
the
only
violation
you
could
have
would
be
“tumultuous
and
offensive”.
and
they
reversed
the
case
twice.
when
they
certified
it
to
the
california
court
of
appeal,
they
did
it
to
settle
an
important
question
of
statutory
interpretation
as
how
is
the
phrase
tumultuous
or
offensive
to
be
read.
the
california
court
of
appeal
read
it
based
on
the
facts
and
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
to
mean
tumultuous
or
offensive
and
that
any
one
of
those
violations
in
and
of
itself
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
the
conduct
is
wearing
the
jacket
displaying
the
sign.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes,
correct.
if
the
man
had
yelled
the
word
mr.
justice
stewart
that
part
of
the
statute
is
not
before
it,
but
it
says
“if
he
yells
it
in
a
loud
and
boisterous
manner
--”
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
okay.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
that’s
correct.
displaying
the
term
that
we
would
contend
is
not
accepted
for
public
display.
the
fact
that
it
appears
in
best
seller’s
i
don’t
believe
is
sufficient
reason
to
allow
it
to
be
displayed
in
public.
there
are
people
who
may
wish
to
read
a
best
seller.
that
is
their
choice.
but
here
individuals
were
a
captive
audience,
they
were
--
with
the
words
foisted
upon
them.
they
could
not
avoid
it
other
than
to
close
their
eyes
but
they
had
the
right
to
be
in
the
corridor
also.
if
it
then
be
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
that
is
correct.
a
word
that
we
contend
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
not
generally
accepted
for
public
display.
i
would
say
if
the
persons
were
in
front
of
the
white
house
picketing
the
president
using
this
word
in
relation
to
the
president,
or
picketing
this
court
with
the
word
in
relation
to
the
court
it
would
still
be
offensive
conduct
of
words
that
are
not
accepted
at
this
time.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
if
they
were
displaying
the
word,
we
would
consider
that
to
be
offensive
conduct.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
well,
in
six-and-a-half
years
at
the
city
attorney’s
office
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
is
the
only
time
i’ve
seen
a
case
of
this
type
come
up,
and
which
has
been
publicly
displayed.
i’m
not
saying
the
word
isn’t
used
but
written
in
public
is
something
else.
people
yelling
it
--
that
we
have
had,
there
have
been,
say
numerous
convictions
where
someone
has
yelled
it.
but
this
is
the
first
case
of
this
instance.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
i
believe
he
got
30
days
in
jail
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
arguments
been
made
that
we
should
have
a
democratic
dialog.
i
agree
that,
conversations
in
part
in
the
streets
are
to
be
used
for
public
arguments.
i
don’t
believe
this
type
of
language
has
to
be
subjected
upon
an
unwilling
public.
i
think
in
the
past
we’ve
seen
candidates
for
public
office
who
have
been
subjected
to
offensive
signs,
language
being
yelled
at
them,
things
that
at
the
moment
are
not
accepted
by
all
the
public.
i
don’t
believe
this
is
the
same
as
an
individual
in
edwards
or
some
of
the
(inaudible)
cases
from
the
south.
the
fact
that
some
white
individuals
may
have
objected
to
the
fact
these
people
were
peacefully
protesting.
because
there’s
no
showing
that
they
displayed
such
signs.
many
of
them
saying
“freedom
songs”
and
engaged
in
say
conduct
like
that.
but
in
this
case
the
man
has
displayed
a
sign
that
the
state
of
california
has
found
to
be
offensive
by
its
decisions.
apparently,
the
decision
was
approved
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
bushman
in
relation
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
is
interesting
that
the
bushman
case
originally
came
to
this
court
and
was
denied
a
writ
of
certiorari,
and
then
went
to
the
california
supreme
court
where
they
granted
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
ruled
where
they
did
approving
apparently
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
we
believe
that
this
is
verbal
communication
that
is
not
permitted
again
i
would
go
back
to
the
chaplinsky
case
where
it's
no
showing
that
major
browning
(ph)
who
was
yelled
was
going
to
react
to
these
words
in
any
way.
the
man
yelled
at
him
and
this
court
approved
the
words
offensive
conduct
in
relation
to
the
lower
court
decision.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
believe
that
would
be
the
only
way
--
one,
in
the
fact
that
california
supreme
court
denied
a
hearing
in
cohen,
and
two
by
the
fact
they
cited
with
approval
what
offensive
conduct
is.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no.
but
going
into
offensive
is
something
that
is
likely
or
would
tend
to
cause
others
to
violence
or
if
the
individual
actually
engages
in
violent
conduct
on
his
own.
i
don’t
believe
there
is
any
discrepancy
between
the
two
court’s
opinions.
because
this
very
same
court,
the
same
seven
justices
who
ruled
in
bushman
unanimously
were
the
same
seven
by
four-to-three
who
denied
a
hearing
in
cohen
and
by
the
fact
that
they
--
one
of
the
dissenters
in
cohen,
chief
justice
treanor,
the
retired
chief
justice
treanor
wrote
the
opinion
in
bushman
so
i
would
have
to
assume
that
they
have
been
approving
of
cohen.
we
would
just
repeat
as
i
had
cited
in
our
brief
and
going
back
to
chaplinsky
it’s
been
well
urged,
paraphrased
in
that
that
words
of
these
type
are
no
essential
part
of
any
exposition
of
ideas
and
sight
social
value
as
to
step
to
the
truth
that
any
benefit
that
may
be
(inaudible)
was
clearly
outweighed
by
the
social
interest
in
order
and
morality.
we
believe
the
conviction
the
california
court
of
appeal
is
valid
and
that
the
judgment
should
stand.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
mr.
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
issue
developed
appellants
opening
argument
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
difference
whether
the
appellant
wore
it
in
a
courtroom
or
in
a
corridor.
if
the
defendant
were
protesting
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
carried
a
similar
sign,
and
walked
across
the
plaza
up
the
marble
staircase
and
down
the
corridor
here,
i
don’t
think
it’d
be
any
different
if
he
stopped
and
took
his
jacket
off
at
the
corridor
or
if
he
entered
the
courtroom
here
with
the
same
type
of

i
believe
the
same
violation
would
have
occurred
that
that
would
have
been
engaging
an
offensive
conduct.
or
if
the

wore

the

just
to
say
to
someone
else
or
spoke

out
in
the
hallway
i
would
still
think
it
would
be
a
violation.
if

there
is
no

i

the

goes

yet
i
would
still
say
it
would

now
the
statute
in
california
says,
“tumultuous

as
pleaded
in
the
complaint
is
“tumultuous

but
i
believe
the
opinion
shows
that
we
never

we

barely

is
our

mr.

mr.

the
record
is
devoid

all
i
could
say
is
the
building
is
the
main
courthouse
in
los
angeles
county
that
has
nine
storeys.
he
was
on
the
seventh
storey,
which
it
means
you
can
enter
on
the
first,
the
second,
or
the
fourth.
so
if
he
entered
the
closest
floor
up,
he
would’ve
entered
the
fourth,
he
would’ve
had
to
walk
down
half
a
block
and
then
ridden
up
three
floors.
so,
unless
he
suddenly
produced
the
jacket
out
of
nowhere
he
had
to
walk
at
least
half
a
block.
mr.
michael

on
a

there’ll
probably
at

of

there’s
probably
200
people
there
but
we
do
not
know
how

were
present
at
this
time.
mr.
michael

unfortunately,
the
record
as
it
came
up
does
not
go
into
that.
apparently,
there
were
at
least
three
people
present.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
if
he
said
it
to
someone
who
doesn’t
accept
those
words,
yes,
i
would
say
that
might
be
offensive

there
is
another
part
of
the

of

we
quote
the
statute
on
page
seven
mr.
justice

mr.
michael
t.
sauer
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
just
said
the
effect
on
the
average
person.
as
i
go
back
and
read
chaplinsky
there’s
no
showing
that
major
browning
(ph)
when
the
man
yelled
at
him
“you
damn
fascist,
you
damn
racketeer”
was
offended
by
the
statement.
there’s
no
showing
that
major
bowering
was
going
to
react
against
them.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
there’s
no
showing.
even
appellant
admits
the
man
was
there
because
just
citizens
who
would
be
present
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no.
i
believe
three
people
saw
it.
there
was
a
sergeant
splaun
(ph),
there
was
someone
named
alexander
and
one
other
person
i
believe
saw
it.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun,
yes.
i
said
the
record
shows
that
there
were
other
individuals
present,
as
well
as
three
specifically
named
individuals.
there
were
women
and
children
present
in
the
corridors.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
i
believe
is
he
was
to
be
a
defense
witness
in
another
case
as
i
understand
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
the
record
doesn’t
show
but
i
would
stipulate
that
he
was
there
as
a
defense
witness
in
another
case
which
this
has
no
bearing
on.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no,
three
people
saw
him
and
they
testified
that
they
had
seen
it
and
that
there
were
women
and
children
present
in
the
corridor.
there
were
at
least
three
people
specifically
named
that
saw
him.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no
the
three
specifically
named
people
did
see
him.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no.
there’s
no
evidence
of
that.
i
believe
you
have
to
--
if
you
take
offensive
as
defined
in
chaplinsky,
you
have
to
apply
it
as
what
the
average
man
would
think.
and
i
would
say
these
words
would
be
offensive
to
the
average
man.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
then
i
don’t
believe
we
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
then
i
doubt
if
we
would
be
here
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
or
a
word
yes,
i
think
collectively
throughout
the
cases
referred
to
the
three
words.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
the
terms
“offensive”
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
past.
in
feiner
versus
new
york
the
defendant
was
charged
among
other
thing
with
using
offensive
language
conduct
or
behavior,
acting
in
a
manner
so
as
to
be
offensive
to
others.
in
chaplinsky,
the
man
was
charged
with
using
offensive
word.
this
word
has
stood
the
test
of
time
in
the
past.
in
other
cases,
in
beauharnais
and
roth
in
discussing
an
area
of
obscene
speech,
if
these
words
are
determined
of
the
obscene
speech,
the
court,
it
was
said,
certainly
no
one
would
contend
that
obscene
speech
may
be
punished
only
upon
a
showing
of
circumstances
of
a
clear
and
present
danger.
in
roth
and
in
beauharnais,
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
if
someone
used
obscene
speech
in
public
that
would
be
a
sufficient
violation.
when
the
court
agreed
to
take
the
case,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
postponed.
one
of
the
arguments
that
people
made
in
their
brief
would
be
that
this
is
merely
the
state
interpretation
of
its
own
statute.
the
trial
court
found
the
man
guilty
as
charged
with
--
the
only
two
words
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
california
upheld
department
of
superior
court
held
that
term
“tumultuous
or
offensive”
they
said
the
only
violation
you
could
have
would
be
“tumultuous
and
offensive”.
and
they
reversed
the
case
twice.
when
they
certified
it
to
the
california
court
of
appeal,
they
did
it
to
settle
an
important
question
of
statutory
interpretation
as
how
is
the
phrase
tumultuous
or
offensive
to
be
read.
the
california
court
of
appeal
read
it
based
on
the
facts
and
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
to
mean
tumultuous
or
offensive
and
that
any
one
of
those
violations
in
and
of
itself
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
the
conduct
is
wearing
the
jacket
displaying
the
sign.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes,
correct.
if
the
man
had
yelled
the
word
mr.
justice
stewart
that
part
of
the
statute
is
not
before
it,
but
it
says
“if
he
yells
it
in
a
loud
and
boisterous
manner
--”
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
okay.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
that’s
correct.
displaying
the
term
that
we
would
contend
is
not
accepted
for
public
display.
the
fact
that
it
appears
in
best
seller’s
i
don’t
believe
is
sufficient
reason
to
allow
it
to
be
displayed
in
public.
there
are
people
who
may
wish
to
read
a
best
seller.
that
is
their
choice.
but
here
individuals
were
a
captive
audience,
they
were
--
with
the
words
foisted
upon
them.
they
could
not
avoid
it
other
than
to
close
their
eyes
but
they
had
the
right
to
be
in
the
corridor
also.
if
it
then
be
--
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
that
is
correct.
a
word
that
we
contend
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
not
generally
accepted
for
public
display.
i
would
say
if
the
persons
were
in
front
of
the
white
house
picketing
the
president
using
this
word
in
relation
to
the
president,
or
picketing
this
court
with
the
word
in
relation
to
the
court
it
would
still
be
offensive
conduct
of
words
that
are
not
accepted
at
this
time.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
if
they
were
displaying
the
word,
we
would
consider
that
to
be
offensive
conduct.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
well,
in
six-and-a-half
years
at
the
city
attorney’s
office
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
is
the
only
time
i’ve
seen
a
case
of
this
type
come
up,
and
which
has
been
publicly
displayed.
i’m
not
saying
the
word
isn’t
used
but
written
in
public
is
something
else.
people
yelling
it
--
that
we
have
had,
there
have
been,
say
numerous
convictions
where
someone
has
yelled
it.
but
this
is
the
first
case
of
this
instance.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
i
believe
he
got
30
days
in
jail
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
arguments
been
made
that
we
should
have
a
democratic
dialog.
i
agree
that,
conversations
in
part
in
the
streets
are
to
be
used
for
public
arguments.
i
don’t
believe
this
type
of
language
has
to
be
subjected
upon
an
unwilling
public.
i
think
in
the
past
we’ve
seen
candidates
for
public
office
who
have
been
subjected
to
offensive
signs,
language
being
yelled
at
them,
things
that
at
the
moment
are
not
accepted
by
all
the
public.
i
don’t
believe
this
is
the
same
as
an
individual
in
edwards
or
some
of
the
(inaudible)
cases
from
the
south.
the
fact
that
some
white
individuals
may
have
objected
to
the
fact
these
people
were
peacefully
protesting.
because
there’s
no
showing
that
they
displayed
such
signs.
many
of
them
saying
“freedom
songs”
and
engaged
in
say
conduct
like
that.
but
in
this
case
the
man
has
displayed
a
sign
that
the
state
of
california
has
found
to
be
offensive
by
its
decisions.
apparently,
the
decision
was
approved
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
bushman
in
relation
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
is
interesting
that
the
bushman
case
originally
came
to
this
court
and
was
denied
a
writ
of
certiorari,
and
then
went
to
the
california
supreme
court
where
they
granted
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
ruled
where
they
did
approving
apparently
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
we
believe
that
this
is
verbal
communication
that
is
not
permitted
again
i
would
go
back
to
the
chaplinsky
case
where
it's
no
showing
that
major
browning
(ph)
who
was
yelled
was
going
to
react
to
these
words
in
any
way.
the
man
yelled
at
him
and
this
court
approved
the
words
offensive
conduct
in
relation
to
the
lower
court
decision.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
believe
that
would
be
the
only
way
--
one,
in
the
fact
that
california
supreme
court
denied
a
hearing
in
cohen,
and
two
by
the
fact
they
cited
with
approval
what
offensive
conduct
is.
mr.
michael
t.
sauer
no.
but
going
into
offensive
is
something
that
is
likely
or
would
tend
to
cause
others
to
violence
or
if
the
individual
actually
engages
in
violent
conduct
on
his
own.
i
don’t
believe
there
is
any
discrepancy
between
the
two
court’s
opinions.
because
this
very
same
court,
the
same
seven
justices
who
ruled
in
bushman
unanimously
were
the
same
seven
by
four-to-three
who
denied
a
hearing
in
cohen
and
by
the
fact
that
they
--
one
of
the
dissenters
in
cohen,
chief
justice
treanor,
the
retired
chief
justice
treanor
wrote
the
opinion
in
bushman
so
i
would
have
to
assume
that
they
have
been
approving
of
cohen.
we
would
just
repeat
as
i
had
cited
in
our
brief
and
going
back
to
chaplinsky
it’s
been
well
urged,
paraphrased
in
that
that
words
of
these
type
are
no
essential
part
of
any
exposition
of
ideas
and
sight
social
value
as
to
step
to
the
truth
that
any
benefit
that
may
be
(inaudible)
was
clearly
outweighed
by
the
social
interest
in
order
and
morality.
we
believe
the
conviction
the
california
court
of
appeal
is
valid
and
that
the
judgment
should
stand.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
