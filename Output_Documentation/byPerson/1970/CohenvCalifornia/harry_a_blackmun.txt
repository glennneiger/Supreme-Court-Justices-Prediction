mr.
nimmer,
before
you
sit
down
may
i
ask
for
a
comment
because
you
haven’t
made
one
on
the
bushman
case
in
california
since
this
one
was
decided.
justice
harry
a.

do
you
feel
that
the
california

bushman
disapproved
of
the
holding
of
the
court

appeals
in
the
present
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
my
next
question
is,
do
you
feel
that
the
bushman
construction
of
the
statute
meets
federal
constitutional
standards?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
would
see
no
point
in
our
remanding
this
case
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
bushman?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.

may
i
read
from
the
settled
statement
on

the
