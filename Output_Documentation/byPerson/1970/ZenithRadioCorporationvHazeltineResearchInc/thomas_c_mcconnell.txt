mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
zenith
radio
corporation,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
it
comes
here
by
way
--
the
case
comes
here
by
way
of
certiorari
to
review
an
order
of
the
court
below,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
vacated
an
award
of
damages
in
favor
of
the
zenith
radio
against
hazeltine
research
inc.,
the
respondent.
the
single
damages
were
$6,297,391.00,
which
tripled,
in
a
damage
award
and
judgment
of
$19,077,173.00.
this
is
a
second
time
this
case
has
been
before
this
court
on
certiorari
and
to
understand
the
present
issue,
i
believe
that
it’s
necessary
for
me
to
briefly
review
the
prior
proceedings.
in
november
of
1959,
the
respondent
sued
the
petitioner
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
chicago
for
the
infringement
of
an
electronic
patent.
the
petitioner
filed
an
answer
setting
up
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
that
it
was
misused
because
its
counterpart
was
placed
in
a
patent
pool
in
canada
known
as
canadian
radio
patents
limited.
in
may
of
--
may
22nd
of
1963,
the
petitioner
filed
a
counterclaim
under
the
antitrust
laws
setting
up
that
it
had
been
interfered
with
in
its
business
in
attempting
to
export
radio
and
television
sets
from
the
united
states
into
the
canadian
market.
its
business
had
been
seriously
damaged
and
asked
for
treble
damages.
on
a
trial,
the
trial
court
found
that
zenith
had
been
damaged
and
in
the
canadian
market
had
been
damaged
to
the
extent
of
over
$6
million,
and
on
april
5,
1965
entered
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
against
the
respondent
in
that
amount
of
money.
after
findings
had
been
made
and
after
the
court
--
i
mean
a
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried
and
the
court
had
entered
its
findings
and
conclusions
against
the
contentions
of
the
respondent,
the
respondent
appearing
with
new
counsel
attempted
to
bring
into
the
case
two
new
defenses,
affirmative
defenses
so
called,
namely
an
attempt
to
plead
the
statute
of
limitations
and
an
attempt
to
bring
in
a
release,
which
had
been
executed
in
a
prior
proceeding
against
rca,
general
electric
and
western
electric,
a
proceeding
to
which
the
respondent
was
not
a
part.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
those
issues
had
not
been
raised
in
the
trial
itself
because
no
pleading
of
the
affirmative
defenses
was
ever
made
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
and
the
first
time
they
appeared
was
a
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried
and
the
proofs
have
been
closed.
the
trial
court
refused
to
reopen
its
findings
and
conclusions
so
far
as
the
canadian
damage
case
was
concerned
and
affirmed
its
judgment.
on
appeal,
the
court
below
reversed
the
canadian
damage
award
on
the
ground
that
it
said
there
was
no
fact
of
damage
shown
by
the
proofs
in
the
case.
the
case
then
came
here
by
certiorari
and
this
court
reversed
the
court
below
on
the
canadian
damage
issue,
and
held
that
there
was
abundant
proof
of
the
fact
of
damage
and
held
that
the
case
should
be
sent
back
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
in
accord
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
now,
i
want
to
quote
one
paragraph
from
this
court’s
prior
opinion
because
it
seems
to
me
it
really
summarizes
the
whole
case
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
this
court
said
in
its
prior
opinion,
“we
conclude
that
the
record
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
damage
resulting
from
events
occurring
after
the
beginning
of
that
damage.
hri
frankly
conceded
the
continuation
of
the
pool
before
the
district
court
and
it
appears
sufficiently
clear
that
throughout
the
time
zenith
was
deprived,
was
always
had
been
refused
a
license
on
pool
patents
preventing
it
to
sell
american-made
merchandise
in
canada.
and
here,
zenith
was
denied
a
valuable
license
and
submitted
testimony
that
without
the
license,
it
had
encountered
distribution
difficulties,
which
prevented
it
securing
a
share
of
the
market,
comparable
to
that
which
it
had
enjoyed
in
the
united
states
and
which
its
business
proficiency
demonstrated
in
the
united
states
dictated
it
should
have
obtained
in
canada.
crpo
was
an
established
organization
with
a
long
history
of
successfully
excluding
imported
merchandise
and
in
view
of
its
continued
existence,
during
the
damage
period,
the
injury
alleged
by
zenith
was
precisely
the
type
of
loss
that
the
claimed
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
be
likely
to
cause.
the
trial
court
was
entitled
to
infer
from
this
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
necessary
cause
or
relation
between
the
pool’s
conduct
and
the
claimed
damage
existed.
now
the
claim
damage
was
or
may
hear
of
damages,
which
has
been
approved
by
every
court
that’s
dealt
with
it
here
in
this
case,
even
the
court
below,
with
a
comparison
between
what
zenith
made
in
the
way
of
profit
in
the
american
market
against
comparable
competition
to
which
it
had
in
canada.
and
during
the
same
period
of
time,
and
the
theory
of
that
was
that
we
were
comparing
what
zenith
could
do
in
an
open
market
as
compared
with
what
it
couldn’t
do
--
could
do
in
an
absolutely
closed
and
restricted
market.
that
computation
showed
that
the
best
zenith
could
do
in
zenith
during
the
damage
period
which
is
a
definite
four-year
period
from
may
22,
1959
to
june
1,
1963,
the
best
that
zenith
could
do
was
3%m
well,
there
was
one
year
that
it
went
up
i
think
5%,
but
it
started
at
3%
and
it
ended
at
3%
faced
with
the
opposition
of
the
pool.
in
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand,
it
had
16%
of
the
radio
and
television
market.
so
transposing
the
profits
on
that
volume
of
business,
we
reach
the
computation
of
the
amount
of
the
damage.
now
the
only
thing
before
this
court
today
is
the
amount
of
petitioner's
damages.
this
court
has
already
held
that
the
fact
of
damages
--
damage,
has
been
proved
and
has
concluded
the
issue
as
between
these
parties
by
a
decision
which
is
res
judicata
and
cannot
be
in
any
way
attacked.
so
we
have
a
very
narrow
issue
here
and
that
is,
was
the
proof
sufficient
here
to
establish
the
amount
of
the
petitioner’s
damage.
on
the
remand,
the
court
below
construed
this
court’s
mandate
as
permitting
it
to
re-examine,
as
if
the
statute
of
limitation’s
defense
and
the
release
defense
was
already
in
the
case,
to
re-examine
what
effect
those
two
defenses
might
have
on
the
amount
of
petitioner’s
damage.
and
it
paraphrased
a
part
of
this
court’s
opinion.
i
think
the
court
--
i
can’t
quote
it
exactly
but
the
substance
of
it
was
--
this
court
said,
“that
since
the
damage
amounts
were
computed
by
assuming
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
four-year
damage
period,
zenith
had
a
mature
market”
which
the
evidence
showed
it
would’ve
had
in
the
absence
of
the
conspiracy,
or
as
testimony
to
that
effect,
not
denied.
since
it
assumed
that,
then
some
part
of
the
damage
which
was
allowed
--
must
have
arisen
from
acts,
overt
acts
or
causative
acts
which
occurred
prior
to
the
damage
period.
and
taking
that
as
a
basis,
the
court
below
then
said
that
any
damages
caused
by
overt
acts
prior
to
the
damage
period,
which
could
be
traced
back
to
show
that
they
have
caused
the
actual
damage
that
that
could
be
considered
on
a
damage
award
in
the
face
of
a
play
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
also
in
the
face
of
a
play
of
release.
now,
there’s
a
question
of
waiver
here
but
i’m
not
going
to
argue
that
here
this
morning
because
our
case
is
so
clear
on
the
merits
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it’s
diverting
and
it
gives
substance
to
the
defenses,
which
it
is
our
position
are
absolutely
irrelevant
and
have
no
merit
whatsoever
on
this
consideration.
it’s
our
position
and
it’s
our
submission
that
only
four
years
of
damages
were
ever
claimed,
that
only
four
years
of
damages
were
ever
awarded,
and
that
the
only
damages
which
were
awarded
were
profits,
which
had
been
lost
by
zenith
in
that
four-year
damage
period.
now,
my
opponents
can
define
the
issue
in
this
way
and
i
think
i’d
better
take
their
word
for
it
because
it’s
a
pretty
good
definition
of
what
this
issue
is.
at
page
62
of
their
brief,
they
say,
“the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
not,
that
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
the
trial
court
should
have
granted
a
new
trial.
on
the
contrary,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
trial
court
had
committed
errors
of
law,
namely
the
failure
to
give
proper
effect
to
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
release
defenses,
and
that
to
correct
those
errors
of
law,
the
taking
of
additional
evidence
on
the
issue
of
the
amount
of
recoverable
damages
is
necessary.”
well
now,
it’s
apparent
that
if
there
was
no
error
of
law
in
that
district
court’s
refusal
to
entertain
those
offenses,
there’s
no
possible
basis
for
the
grant
of
a
new
trial
by
the
court
below.
now
it’s
our
contention
that
since
none
of
the
petitioner’s
damages
accrued
are
came
into
be
until
the
damage
period,
it’s
absolutely
irrelevant
whether
they’ve
caused
any
of
act
or
originated
in
some
previous
time,
or
whether
they
trace
back
by
some
sort
of
proof
how
much
of
the
award
was
due
to
this
or
that,
that
happened
prior
to
the
damage
award.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
of
limitations
which
is
applicable
to
this
case,
which
bars
recovery
on
damages
which
accrue
in
the
four-year
period.
section
4
(b)
of
the
act
provides
and
is
very
specific,
there
isn’t
any
ambiguity
about
it
at
all.
“any
action
to
enforce
any
cause
of
action
under
sections
15
or
15
(a)
or
this
title
shall
be
forever
barred
unless
commenced
within
four
years
after
the
cause
of
action
accrued.”
the
court
below
interpolated
into
that
statute
the
following
words.
it
said,
“the
law
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations
in
section
15
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
that
the
period
commences
to
run
from
the
last
overt
act
of
the
conspiracy.”
so
there’s
nothing
like
that
in
this
statute.
it’s
a
complete
reading
into
the
act
of
something
which
isn’t
there,
and
this
court
said
in
radovich
against
the
national
football
league
that
it
was
the
province
of
the
court
to
construe
the
statute
as
it
was
and
not
read
into
it.
it
should
not
add
requirements
to
burden
to
private
litigant
beyond
what
is
specifically
set
forth
by
the
congress
in
those
laws,
and
there’s
no
congressional
authority
whatever
for
reading
into
this
very
clear
statute
of
limitations
the
words
which
the
court
below
did.
now,
that
brings
us
to
when
does
this
cause
of
action
accrue.
in
a
civil
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
until
damage
has
ensued
which
is
actionable.
that’s
when
your
cause
of
action
accrues
and
that
is
admitted
at
pages
41
to
42
of
the
respondent’s
brief.
here,
the
cause
of
action
could
not
accrue
until
zenith
lost
profits.
it
hadn’t
lost
the
profits
until
the
four-year
damage
period
and
there
was
no
way
on
which
it
could
sue
for
a
lost
of
profits
before
the
profits
had
been
lost.
it
had
to
await
the
time
when
it
had
lost
its
profits
and
all
of
its
proof
was
based
on
a
computation,
which
by
the
way
was
never
denied.
no
testimony
against
it
of
how
much
profit
was
lost
during
a
particular
four-year
damage
period.
the
court
below
and
my
opponent
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
must
run
from
the
overt
acts
which
caused
the
loss
of
profits
and
let’s
see
where
that
leads
us.
that
means
that
if
any
of
the
acts
which
caused
this
loss
of
profits
occurred
prior
to
this
damage
period,
zenith
couldn’t
have
sued
for
them
then.
it
hadn’t
lost
any
profits
and
when
it
got
down
to
the
time
when
it
had
lost
the
profits,
it
couldn’t
sue
for
the
overt
acts
because
they’re
barred
by
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
whole
argument
obviously
just
proves
too
much
and
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
now,
bear
in
mind,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
continuing
conspiracy.
this
court
found
that
this
conspiracy
existed
all
during
the
damage
period,
found
that
specifically
in
it’s
opinion
and
that
we’re
dealing
with
constant
invasions
of
our
rights
all
during
the
time
we’re
trying
to
compete
in
canada
during
this
four-year
period.
now,
could
we
have
sued
for
those
profits
prior
to
the
damage
period?
well,
all
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
proof
that
it
was
a
adduced
here
to
see
that
that’s
impossible.
first,
zenith
had
to
show
and
this
court
on
another
branch
of
this
case
held
that
in
order
to
show
fact
of
damage,
you’ve
got
to
show
that
you
are
equipped
to
compete,
that
you’re
ready
and
willing
to
compete
in
the
foreign
markets
from
which
you’ve
claim
to
be
excluded,
and
that
absent
to
conspiracy,
you
would’ve
been
there
competing
on
that,
the
(inaudible)
said
that
we
hadn’t
made
that
proof
in
england
and
australia.
so
how
could
you
make
proof
of
that
kind
prior
to
the
damage
period?
you
had
to
show
that
you
were
in
business,
that
you
wanted
to
compete,
that
you
were
equipped
to
compete,
and
that
you
were
prevented
from
competing.
secondly,
we
had
to
show
that
this
pool
was
in
operation
during
this
whole
four-year
damage
period,
and
we
couldn’t
show
that
prior
to
the
damage
period.
they
could’ve
disbanded
their
pool.
it
would
be
entirely
speculative
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would’ve
continued
it.
and
thirdly,
we
had
to
show
a
comparable
measure
of
damage
in
the
united
states,
which
meant
that
we
had
to
be
in
business
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
canada
during
the
damage
period.
so
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
zenith
to
have
proved
up
the
loss
of
profits,
which
it
did
prior
to
this
damage
period.
and
the
fact
that
overt
acts
enter
into
it,
i
don’t
care
where
they
originated.
if
they
originated
way
back
in
1926
when
this
pool
originated,
they
had
a
causative
effect
that
didn’t
result
in
damages
until
a
damage
period.
there
was
no
cause
of
action
until
they
did
originate
in
damages,
but
when
they
did
originate
from
damage,
it
was
only
during
a
four-year
period
and
the
statute
does
not
bar
them,
and
the
act
so
says,
because
the
act
says
that
it
starts
when
the
cause
of
action
accrued,
not
when
overt
acts
were
performed
but
when
the
cause
of
action
accrued.
so
much
for
the
statute
of
limitations,
we
say
it’s
absolutely,
utterly
irrelevant
even
if
it
had
properly
gotten
into
the
case,
which
we
do
not
agree.
so
i
want
to
turn
now
to
the
release
point.
there
was
a
release
given
in
this
record
but
it
hadn’t
anything
to
do
with
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that
release
was
in
a
prior
proceeding
between
zenith
rca,
western
electric,
and
general
electric.
we
had
been
excluded
continuously
by
this
pool
since
1926.
we
sued
them
in
our
counterclaim
in
the
untied
states
district
court,
and
we
settled
the
case.
and
we’ve
settled
it
with
a
release
given
september
of
1957,
a
year-and-a-half
before
this
damage
period
started.
now
the
court
below
had
a
little
difficulty
with
this
and
understandably
so
so.
following
chronically
occurred
between
the
court
and
counsel.
the
court:
“when
was
the
rca
release
signed?”
mr.
kayser:
“it
was
signed
as
i
understand
it
on
september
27,
1957.”
the
court:
“as
i
understand
it,
they
are
only
claiming,
according
to
your
chart,
from
may
22nd
of
1959
to
may
22nd
of
1963.”
mr.
kayser:
“yes,
your
honor,
that
is
very
true.”
the
court:
“i
am
not
sufficiently
astute
today
to
understand
your
theory
so
that
i
can
understand
how
this
release
in
’57
had
anything
to
do
with
what
occurred
in
’59
to
’63.”
now,
it’s
our
position
that
if
the
court
below
can
construe
a
release
executed
in
1957
to
bar
our
cause
of
action
which
did
not
arise
and
did
not
exist
until
1959,
then
this
release
is
construed
in
a
manner
to
release
a
future
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
which
would
be
illegal,
invalid,
and
against
public
policy
because
the
public
has
an
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
the
treble
damage
provisions
of
the
antitrust
laws.
there
are
other
reasons
why
this
release
is
not
that
and
they’re
discussed
in
the
briefs.
so
it’s
our
submission
that
there’s
no
relevance
in
either
of
these
defenses,
if
they’d
been
in
the
case,
there
was
nothing
to
them
and
they
never
got
on
in
the
case,
and
this
court
referred
to
them
as
belatedly
raised
in
its
prior
opinion.
now,
i
have
one
further
point.
bear
in
mind
this
court
has
already
found
the
fact
of
damage.
the
only
question
is
the
amount
and
going
back
to
the
eastman
kodak
case,
this
court
has
held
that
once
the
fact
of
damage
is
established,
mere
on
certainty
as
to
amount
will
not
vitiate
an
award
of
damages
because
the
uncertainty,
which
we’re
talking
about,
and
we’re
talking
about
it
here,
the
claim
is
that
we
didn’t
have
a
mature
market
to
begin
with
and
it's
speculative
whether
we
would’ve
had
and
therefore,
there’s
uncertainty
and
therefore,
our
whole
damage
computation
is
uncertain
and
the
damages
awarded
are
uncertain,
but
throughout
their
briefs
and
throughout
the
argument,
the
respondent
has
taken
the
position
that
they
have
been
in
this
pool
since
well,
20
years,
and
they
have
contributed
along
with
their
co-conspirators
to
our
inability
to
commit
--
compete
in
any
way
in
canada.
of
course,
we
had
no
mature
market.
we
couldn’t
get
a
mature
market,
and
the
reason
we
didn’t
have
a
mature
market
was
because
they
had
prevented
it.
in
other
words,
to
apply
that
argument
to
this
case,
means
that
the
uncertainty,
if
there
is
an
uncertainty,
and
we
do
not
believe
there
is
in
view
of
the
evidence
in
the
case,
first,
that
we
would’ve
had
it
absent
the
conspiracy
not
denied,
computation
of
damages
not
denied,
not
objected
to,
no
objection
on
the
ground
that
it
was
uncertain,
went
in
without
objection,
no
contrary
proof,
no
opinion
proof
that’s
contrary
within
that
situation.
this
court
said
in
the
bigelow
and
it
said
in
other
cases.
the
jury
may
make
a
just
and
reasonable
estimate
of
the
damage
based
on
relevant
data
and
render
the
verdict
accordingly.
in
such
circumstances,
juries
are
allowed
to
act
upon
probable
and
inferential,
as
well
as
direct
and
positive
proof.
any
other
rule
would
enable
the
wrongdoer
to
profit
by
his
wrongdoing
at
the
expense
of
his
victim,
and
they
said
it
in
another
way.
this
court
said
it
in
another
way
by
saying
in
the
absence
of
more
precise
proof,
the
best
evidence
that
can
be
produced
is
all
right
because,
quote,
“the
most
elementary
conceptions
of
justice
and
public
policy
required
that
the
wrongdoer
shall
bear
the
risk
of
the
uncertainty,
which
his
own
wrong
has
created.”
and
here
throughout
their
briefs,
these
gentlemen
say
they
have
created
the
uncertainty
because
they’ve
kept
us
out
of
this
market
during
all
the
prior
period
of
the
damage
period.
now,
as
i
say,
this
court
has
held
the
fact
of
damage.
what
did
the
court
below
say?
court
below
says
there
was
a
testimony
for
zenith
relied
on
by
the
district
court
that
in
the
four-year
damage
period,
had
zenith
been
free
from
the
unlawful
activity
of
the
canadian
pool
which
virtually
excluded
it
from
the
canadian
market,
it
would
have
enjoyed
the
same
proportion
of
that
market
as
it
did
in
the
united
states.
in
canada,
its
principal
competitors
were
the
same
as
those
in
the
united
states.
its
promotion
and
advertising
float
back
and
forth
between
the
two
countries.
distributors
in
canada
were
available,
but
were
frightened
off
by
the
pool’s
activities
and
threats.
it
is
our
view
that
this
was
competent
evidence
prima
facie
upon
which
the
amount
of
damages
could
be
reasonable
approximated
by
virtue
of
the
supreme
court’s
decision
in
bigelow
and
there
is
not
one
iota
of
countervailing
evidence,
and
i
submit
that
the
judgment
entered
april
5,
1965
should
be
reinstated.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
zenith
radio
corporation,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
it
comes
here
by
way
--
the
case
comes
here
by
way
of
certiorari
to
review
an
order
of
the
court
below,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
vacated
an
award
of
damages
in
favor
of
the
zenith
radio
against
hazeltine
research
inc.,
the
respondent.
the
single
damages
were
$6,297,391.00,
which
tripled,
in
a
damage
award
and
judgment
of
$19,077,173.00.
this
is
a
second
time
this
case
has
been
before
this
court
on
certiorari
and
to
understand
the
present
issue,
i
believe
that
it’s
necessary
for
me
to
briefly
review
the
prior
proceedings.
in
november
of
1959,
the
respondent
sued
the
petitioner
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
chicago
for
the
infringement
of
an
electronic
patent.
the
petitioner
filed
an
answer
setting
up
that
the
patent
was
invalid
and
that
it
was
misused
because
its
counterpart
was
placed
in
a
patent
pool
in
canada
known
as
canadian
radio
patents
limited.
in
may
of
--
may
22nd
of
1963,
the
petitioner
filed
a
counterclaim
under
the
antitrust
laws
setting
up
that
it
had
been
interfered
with
in
its
business
in
attempting
to
export
radio
and
television
sets
from
the
united
states
into
the
canadian
market.
its
business
had
been
seriously
damaged
and
asked
for
treble
damages.
on
a
trial,
the
trial
court
found
that
zenith
had
been
damaged
and
in
the
canadian
market
had
been
damaged
to
the
extent
of
over
$6
million,
and
on
april
5,
1965
entered
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
against
the
respondent
in
that
amount
of
money.
after
findings
had
been
made
and
after
the
court
--
i
mean
a
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried
and
the
court
had
entered
its
findings
and
conclusions
against
the
contentions
of
the
respondent,
the
respondent
appearing
with
new
counsel
attempted
to
bring
into
the
case
two
new
defenses,
affirmative
defenses
so
called,
namely
an
attempt
to
plead
the
statute
of
limitations
and
an
attempt
to
bring
in
a
release,
which
had
been
executed
in
a
prior
proceeding
against
rca,
general
electric
and
western
electric,
a
proceeding
to
which
the
respondent
was
not
a
part.
mr.
thomas
c.
mcconnell
those
issues
had
not
been
raised
in
the
trial
itself
because
no
pleading
of
the
affirmative
defenses
was
ever
made
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
and
the
first
time
they
appeared
was
a
year
after
the
case
had
been
tried
and
the
proofs
have
been
closed.
the
trial
court
refused
to
reopen
its
findings
and
conclusions
so
far
as
the
canadian
damage
case
was
concerned
and
affirmed
its
judgment.
on
appeal,
the
court
below
reversed
the
canadian
damage
award
on
the
ground
that
it
said
there
was
no
fact
of
damage
shown
by
the
proofs
in
the
case.
the
case
then
came
here
by
certiorari
and
this
court
reversed
the
court
below
on
the
canadian
damage
issue,
and
held
that
there
was
abundant
proof
of
the
fact
of
damage
and
held
that
the
case
should
be
sent
back
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
in
accord
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
now,
i
want
to
quote
one
paragraph
from
this
court’s
prior
opinion
because
it
seems
to
me
it
really
summarizes
the
whole
case
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
this
court
said
in
its
prior
opinion,
“we
conclude
that
the
record
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
damage
resulting
from
events
occurring
after
the
beginning
of
that
damage.
hri
frankly
conceded
the
continuation
of
the
pool
before
the
district
court
and
it
appears
sufficiently
clear
that
throughout
the
time
zenith
was
deprived,
was
always
had
been
refused
a
license
on
pool
patents
preventing
it
to
sell
american-made
merchandise
in
canada.
and
here,
zenith
was
denied
a
valuable
license
and
submitted
testimony
that
without
the
license,
it
had
encountered
distribution
difficulties,
which
prevented
it
securing
a
share
of
the
market,
comparable
to
that
which
it
had
enjoyed
in
the
united
states
and
which
its
business
proficiency
demonstrated
in
the
united
states
dictated
it
should
have
obtained
in
canada.
crpo
was
an
established
organization
with
a
long
history
of
successfully
excluding
imported
merchandise
and
in
view
of
its
continued
existence,
during
the
damage
period,
the
injury
alleged
by
zenith
was
precisely
the
type
of
loss
that
the
claimed
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
be
likely
to
cause.
the
trial
court
was
entitled
to
infer
from
this
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
necessary
cause
or
relation
between
the
pool’s
conduct
and
the
claimed
damage
existed.
now
the
claim
damage
was
or
may
hear
of
damages,
which
has
been
approved
by
every
court
that’s
dealt
with
it
here
in
this
case,
even
the
court
below,
with
a
comparison
between
what
zenith
made
in
the
way
of
profit
in
the
american
market
against
comparable
competition
to
which
it
had
in
canada.
and
during
the
same
period
of
time,
and
the
theory
of
that
was
that
we
were
comparing
what
zenith
could
do
in
an
open
market
as
compared
with
what
it
couldn’t
do
--
could
do
in
an
absolutely
closed
and
restricted
market.
that
computation
showed
that
the
best
zenith
could
do
in
zenith
during
the
damage
period
which
is
a
definite
four-year
period
from
may
22,
1959
to
june
1,
1963,
the
best
that
zenith
could
do
was
3%m
well,
there
was
one
year
that
it
went
up
i
think
5%,
but
it
started
at
3%
and
it
ended
at
3%
faced
with
the
opposition
of
the
pool.
in
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand,
it
had
16%
of
the
radio
and
television
market.
so
transposing
the
profits
on
that
volume
of
business,
we
reach
the
computation
of
the
amount
of
the
damage.
now
the
only
thing
before
this
court
today
is
the
amount
of
petitioner's
damages.
this
court
has
already
held
that
the
fact
of
damages
--
damage,
has
been
proved
and
has
concluded
the
issue
as
between
these
parties
by
a
decision
which
is
res
judicata
and
cannot
be
in
any
way
attacked.
so
we
have
a
very
narrow
issue
here
and
that
is,
was
the
proof
sufficient
here
to
establish
the
amount
of
the
petitioner’s
damage.
on
the
remand,
the
court
below
construed
this
court’s
mandate
as
permitting
it
to
re-examine,
as
if
the
statute
of
limitation’s
defense
and
the
release
defense
was
already
in
the
case,
to
re-examine
what
effect
those
two
defenses
might
have
on
the
amount
of
petitioner’s
damage.
and
it
paraphrased
a
part
of
this
court’s
opinion.
i
think
the
court
--
i
can’t
quote
it
exactly
but
the
substance
of
it
was
--
this
court
said,
“that
since
the
damage
amounts
were
computed
by
assuming
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
four-year
damage
period,
zenith
had
a
mature
market”
which
the
evidence
showed
it
would’ve
had
in
the
absence
of
the
conspiracy,
or
as
testimony
to
that
effect,
not
denied.
since
it
assumed
that,
then
some
part
of
the
damage
which
was
allowed
--
must
have
arisen
from
acts,
overt
acts
or
causative
acts
which
occurred
prior
to
the
damage
period.
and
taking
that
as
a
basis,
the
court
below
then
said
that
any
damages
caused
by
overt
acts
prior
to
the
damage
period,
which
could
be
traced
back
to
show
that
they
have
caused
the
actual
damage
that
that
could
be
considered
on
a
damage
award
in
the
face
of
a
play
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
also
in
the
face
of
a
play
of
release.
now,
there’s
a
question
of
waiver
here
but
i’m
not
going
to
argue
that
here
this
morning
because
our
case
is
so
clear
on
the
merits
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it’s
diverting
and
it
gives
substance
to
the
defenses,
which
it
is
our
position
are
absolutely
irrelevant
and
have
no
merit
whatsoever
on
this
consideration.
it’s
our
position
and
it’s
our
submission
that
only
four
years
of
damages
were
ever
claimed,
that
only
four
years
of
damages
were
ever
awarded,
and
that
the
only
damages
which
were
awarded
were
profits,
which
had
been
lost
by
zenith
in
that
four-year
damage
period.
now,
my
opponents
can
define
the
issue
in
this
way
and
i
think
i’d
better
take
their
word
for
it
because
it’s
a
pretty
good
definition
of
what
this
issue
is.
at
page
62
of
their
brief,
they
say,
“the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
not,
that
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
the
trial
court
should
have
granted
a
new
trial.
on
the
contrary,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
trial
court
had
committed
errors
of
law,
namely
the
failure
to
give
proper
effect
to
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
release
defenses,
and
that
to
correct
those
errors
of
law,
the
taking
of
additional
evidence
on
the
issue
of
the
amount
of
recoverable
damages
is
necessary.”
well
now,
it’s
apparent
that
if
there
was
no
error
of
law
in
that
district
court’s
refusal
to
entertain
those
offenses,
there’s
no
possible
basis
for
the
grant
of
a
new
trial
by
the
court
below.
now
it’s
our
contention
that
since
none
of
the
petitioner’s
damages
accrued
are
came
into
be
until
the
damage
period,
it’s
absolutely
irrelevant
whether
they’ve
caused
any
of
act
or
originated
in
some
previous
time,
or
whether
they
trace
back
by
some
sort
of
proof
how
much
of
the
award
was
due
to
this
or
that,
that
happened
prior
to
the
damage
award.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
of
limitations
which
is
applicable
to
this
case,
which
bars
recovery
on
damages
which
accrue
in
the
four-year
period.
section
4
(b)
of
the
act
provides
and
is
very
specific,
there
isn’t
any
ambiguity
about
it
at
all.
“any
action
to
enforce
any
cause
of
action
under
sections
15
or
15
(a)
or
this
title
shall
be
forever
barred
unless
commenced
within
four
years
after
the
cause
of
action
accrued.”
the
court
below
interpolated
into
that
statute
the
following
words.
it
said,
“the
law
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations
in
section
15
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
that
the
period
commences
to
run
from
the
last
overt
act
of
the
conspiracy.”
so
there’s
nothing
like
that
in
this
statute.
it’s
a
complete
reading
into
the
act
of
something
which
isn’t
there,
and
this
court
said
in
radovich
against
the
national
football
league
that
it
was
the
province
of
the
court
to
construe
the
statute
as
it
was
and
not
read
into
it.
it
should
not
add
requirements
to
burden
to
private
litigant
beyond
what
is
specifically
set
forth
by
the
congress
in
those
laws,
and
there’s
no
congressional
authority
whatever
for
reading
into
this
very
clear
statute
of
limitations
the
words
which
the
court
below
did.
now,
that
brings
us
to
when
does
this
cause
of
action
accrue.
in
a
civil
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
until
damage
has
ensued
which
is
actionable.
that’s
when
your
cause
of
action
accrues
and
that
is
admitted
at
pages
41
to
42
of
the
respondent’s
brief.
here,
the
cause
of
action
could
not
accrue
until
zenith
lost
profits.
it
hadn’t
lost
the
profits
until
the
four-year
damage
period
and
there
was
no
way
on
which
it
could
sue
for
a
lost
of
profits
before
the
profits
had
been
lost.
it
had
to
await
the
time
when
it
had
lost
its
profits
and
all
of
its
proof
was
based
on
a
computation,
which
by
the
way
was
never
denied.
no
testimony
against
it
of
how
much
profit
was
lost
during
a
particular
four-year
damage
period.
the
court
below
and
my
opponent
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
must
run
from
the
overt
acts
which
caused
the
loss
of
profits
and
let’s
see
where
that
leads
us.
that
means
that
if
any
of
the
acts
which
caused
this
loss
of
profits
occurred
prior
to
this
damage
period,
zenith
couldn’t
have
sued
for
them
then.
it
hadn’t
lost
any
profits
and
when
it
got
down
to
the
time
when
it
had
lost
the
profits,
it
couldn’t
sue
for
the
overt
acts
because
they’re
barred
by
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
whole
argument
obviously
just
proves
too
much
and
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
now,
bear
in
mind,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
continuing
conspiracy.
this
court
found
that
this
conspiracy
existed
all
during
the
damage
period,
found
that
specifically
in
it’s
opinion
and
that
we’re
dealing
with
constant
invasions
of
our
rights
all
during
the
time
we’re
trying
to
compete
in
canada
during
this
four-year
period.
now,
could
we
have
sued
for
those
profits
prior
to
the
damage
period?
well,
all
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
proof
that
it
was
a
adduced
here
to
see
that
that’s
impossible.
first,
zenith
had
to
show
and
this
court
on
another
branch
of
this
case
held
that
in
order
to
show
fact
of
damage,
you’ve
got
to
show
that
you
are
equipped
to
compete,
that
you’re
ready
and
willing
to
compete
in
the
foreign
markets
from
which
you’ve
claim
to
be
excluded,
and
that
absent
to
conspiracy,
you
would’ve
been
there
competing
on
that,
the
(inaudible)
said
that
we
hadn’t
made
that
proof
in
england
and
australia.
so
how
could
you
make
proof
of
that
kind
prior
to
the
damage
period?
you
had
to
show
that
you
were
in
business,
that
you
wanted
to
compete,
that
you
were
equipped
to
compete,
and
that
you
were
prevented
from
competing.
secondly,
we
had
to
show
that
this
pool
was
in
operation
during
this
whole
four-year
damage
period,
and
we
couldn’t
show
that
prior
to
the
damage
period.
they
could’ve
disbanded
their
pool.
it
would
be
entirely
speculative
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would’ve
continued
it.
and
thirdly,
we
had
to
show
a
comparable
measure
of
damage
in
the
united
states,
which
meant
that
we
had
to
be
in
business
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
canada
during
the
damage
period.
so
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
zenith
to
have
proved
up
the
loss
of
profits,
which
it
did
prior
to
this
damage
period.
and
the
fact
that
overt
acts
enter
into
it,
i
don’t
care
where
they
originated.
if
they
originated
way
back
in
1926
when
this
pool
originated,
they
had
a
causative
effect
that
didn’t
result
in
damages
until
a
damage
period.
there
was
no
cause
of
action
until
they
did
originate
in
damages,
but
when
they
did
originate
from
damage,
it
was
only
during
a
four-year
period
and
the
statute
does
not
bar
them,
and
the
act
so
says,
because
the
act
says
that
it
starts
when
the
cause
of
action
accrued,
not
when
overt
acts
were
performed
but
when
the
cause
of
action
accrued.
so
much
for
the
statute
of
limitations,
we
say
it’s
absolutely,
utterly
irrelevant
even
if
it
had
properly
gotten
into
the
case,
which
we
do
not
agree.
so
i
want
to
turn
now
to
the
release
point.
there
was
a
release
given
in
this
record
but
it
hadn’t
anything
to
do
with
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that
release
was
in
a
prior
proceeding
between
zenith
rca,
western
electric,
and
general
electric.
we
had
been
excluded
continuously
by
this
pool
since
1926.
we
sued
them
in
our
counterclaim
in
the
untied
states
district
court,
and
we
settled
the
case.
and
we’ve
settled
it
with
a
release
given
september
of
1957,
a
year-and-a-half
before
this
damage
period
started.
now
the
court
below
had
a
little
difficulty
with
this
and
understandably
so
so.
following
chronically
occurred
between
the
court
and
counsel.
the
court:
“when
was
the
rca
release
signed?”
mr.
kayser:
“it
was
signed
as
i
understand
it
on
september
27,
1957.”
the
court:
“as
i
understand
it,
they
are
only
claiming,
according
to
your
chart,
from
may
22nd
of
1959
to
may
22nd
of
1963.”
mr.
kayser:
“yes,
your
honor,
that
is
very
true.”
the
court:
“i
am
not
sufficiently
astute
today
to
understand
your
theory
so
that
i
can
understand
how
this
release
in
’57
had
anything
to
do
with
what
occurred
in
’59
to
’63.”
now,
it’s
our
position
that
if
the
court
below
can
construe
a
release
executed
in
1957
to
bar
our
cause
of
action
which
did
not
arise
and
did
not
exist
until
1959,
then
this
release
is
construed
in
a
manner
to
release
a
future
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
which
would
be
illegal,
invalid,
and
against
public
policy
because
the
public
has
an
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
the
treble
damage
provisions
of
the
antitrust
laws.
there
are
other
reasons
why
this
release
is
not
that
and
they’re
discussed
in
the
briefs.
so
it’s
our
submission
that
there’s
no
relevance
in
either
of
these
defenses,
if
they’d
been
in
the
case,
there
was
nothing
to
them
and
they
never
got
on
in
the
case,
and
this
court
referred
to
them
as
belatedly
raised
in
its
prior
opinion.
now,
i
have
one
further
point.
bear
in
mind
this
court
has
already
found
the
fact
of
damage.
the
only
question
is
the
amount
and
going
back
to
the
eastman
kodak
case,
this
court
has
held
that
once
the
fact
of
damage
is
established,
mere
on
certainty
as
to
amount
will
not
vitiate
an
award
of
damages
because
the
uncertainty,
which
we’re
talking
about,
and
we’re
talking
about
it
here,
the
claim
is
that
we
didn’t
have
a
mature
market
to
begin
with
and
it's
speculative
whether
we
would’ve
had
and
therefore,
there’s
uncertainty
and
therefore,
our
whole
damage
computation
is
uncertain
and
the
damages
awarded
are
uncertain,
but
throughout
their
briefs
and
throughout
the
argument,
the
respondent
has
taken
the
position
that
they
have
been
in
this
pool
since
well,
20
years,
and
they
have
contributed
along
with
their
co-conspirators
to
our
inability
to
commit
--
compete
in
any
way
in
canada.
of
course,
we
had
no
mature
market.
we
couldn’t
get
a
mature
market,
and
the
reason
we
didn’t
have
a
mature
market
was
because
they
had
prevented
it.
in
other
words,
to
apply
that
argument
to
this
case,
means
that
the
uncertainty,
if
there
is
an
uncertainty,
and
we
do
not
believe
there
is
in
view
of
the
evidence
in
the
case,
first,
that
we
would’ve
had
it
absent
the
conspiracy
not
denied,
computation
of
damages
not
denied,
not
objected
to,
no
objection
on
the
ground
that
it
was
uncertain,
went
in
without
objection,
no
contrary
proof,
no
opinion
proof
that’s
contrary
within
that
situation.
this
court
said
in
the
bigelow
and
it
said
in
other
cases.
the
jury
may
make
a
just
and
reasonable
estimate
of
the
damage
based
on
relevant
data
and
render
the
verdict
accordingly.
in
such
circumstances,
juries
are
allowed
to
act
upon
probable
and
inferential,
as
well
as
direct
and
positive
proof.
any
other
rule
would
enable
the
wrongdoer
to
profit
by
his
wrongdoing
at
the
expense
of
his
victim,
and
they
said
it
in
another
way.
this
court
said
it
in
another
way
by
saying
in
the
absence
of
more
precise
proof,
the
best
evidence
that
can
be
produced
is
all
right
because,
quote,
“the
most
elementary
conceptions
of
justice
and
public
policy
required
that
the
wrongdoer
shall
bear
the
risk
of
the
uncertainty,
which
his
own
wrong
has
created.”
and
here
throughout
their
briefs,
these
gentlemen
say
they
have
created
the
uncertainty
because
they’ve
kept
us
out
of
this
market
during
all
the
prior
period
of
the
damage
period.
now,
as
i
say,
this
court
has
held
the
fact
of
damage.
what
did
the
court
below
say?
court
below
says
there
was
a
testimony
for
zenith
relied
on
by
the
district
court
that
in
the
four-year
damage
period,
had
zenith
been
free
from
the
unlawful
activity
of
the
canadian
pool
which
virtually
excluded
it
from
the
canadian
market,
it
would
have
enjoyed
the
same
proportion
of
that
market
as
it
did
in
the
united
states.
in
canada,
its
principal
competitors
were
the
same
as
those
in
the
united
states.
its
promotion
and
advertising
float
back
and
forth
between
the
two
countries.
distributors
in
canada
were
available,
but
were
frightened
off
by
the
pool’s
activities
and
threats.
it
is
our
view
that
this
was
competent
evidence
prima
facie
upon
which
the
amount
of
damages
could
be
reasonable
approximated
by
virtue
of
the
supreme
court’s
decision
in
bigelow
and
there
is
not
one
iota
of
countervailing
evidence,
and
i
submit
that
the
judgment
entered
april
5,
1965
should
be
reinstated.
