justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kayser,
there
are
some
indications
in
the
opinion
below
that
this
is
not
the
only
problem
in
dealing
with
damages
in
this
case.
some
indications
that
there
might
be
some
further
limitation
was
on
based
on
what
caused
the
damages
during
the
damage
period.
let’s
assume
that
zenith
proved
that
without
the
conspiracy,
that
it
had
been
a
free
market,
it
could
have
had
and
if
it
were
starting
in
a
price
at
the
beginning
of
the
damage
period,
it
could’ve
had
5%
the
first
year,
10
the
second,
15
the
third,
and
16
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
year.
would
it
be
entitled
under
the
opinion
below
to
recover
the
difference
between
those
percentages
and
what
it
actually
had
during
those
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
mean
that
it
would
be
enough
to
--
for
example,
if
he
could
recover
the
difference
between
15%
that
it
would’ve
had
in
the
third
year,
and
the
3%
that
it
had
in
the
third
year,
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
that’s
just
--
all
that
is,
is
a
matter
of
show
of
evidence
to
show
what
it
could’ve
done
in
the
market,
in
the
free
market
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
practically,
established
already.
i
mean
you
don’t
have
enough
time
to
get
to
16%?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
but
isn’t
it
established
in
the
case
that
they
could’ve
reached
16%,
given
the
free
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
not
challenging
that
really
here,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
isn’t
this
--
isn’t
the
--
isn’t
that
question
really
disposed
of
by
the
right
to
litigation
up
to
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
really
is
quite
a
bit
left
over
--
pertinent
point
in
this
case.
you’re
challenging
not
only
this
pre-damage
period
matter,
but
also
zenith’s
ability
to
achieve
15%
within
this
damage
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
--
i’ll
just
ask
one
more
important
question.
let’s
assume
that
it
approved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
at
the
end
of
four
years
it
could’ve
had
10%.
let’s
just
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
could
figure,
and
it
only
had
3%
in
the
fourth
year.
now
do
you
think
that
on
the
facts
are
already
established
in
this
record
if
it
is
--
it
could
be
cover
as
damages
illustrating
a
10%
and
the
7%
in
the
fourth
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
just
avoiding
that,
just
avoiding
the
question.
i
said,
let’s
assume
that
you
have
to
prove
that
they
would’ve
had
10%
in
the
fourth
year
and
they
only
had
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
--
do
you
have
any
legal
basis
per
se
that
they
could
not
recover
the
7%?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
content,
what
would
have
caused
that
damage,
that
7%,
mr.
kayser?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
wouldn’t
say
that
they
were
not
used
to
the
area?
the
court
below
indicated
that
perhaps
it
could
only
recover
damages
traceable
to
some
specific
overt
acts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
did,
you
wouldn’t
agree
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
release
apply
to
a
less
than
a
49%
home
subsidiary?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
release
applied
to
subsidiaries,
then
the
time
subsidiaries
as
being
only
subsidiaries
with
around
49%
or
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
what
purpose
could
they
possibly
wanted
to
define
subsidiaries
if
they
meant
to
include
all
subsidiaries?
justice

r.
white
