mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
propose
to
spend
my
half
hour
primarily
answering
the
assertions
made
by
zenith’s
counsel
but
i
would
like
first
to
give
a
brief
background
against
which
this
discussion
may
be
conducted.
zenith
counsel
stated
correctly
the
issue
here
involves
the
amount
of
damages
recoverable
by
zenith,
and
zenith’s
right
to
recover
some
damages
is
not
in
dispute.
this
court
ruled
on
the
prior
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
recognized
on
remand
that
zenith
is
entitled
to
recover
those
damages
flowing
from
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
canadian
patent
pool
taking
place
during
the
four-year
period,
may
22,
1959
to
may
22,
1963.
but
the
question
which
remains
is
whether
zenith
is
entitled
to
recover
those
damages
suffered
during
the
four-year
period
but
as
a
result
of
acts
of
the
canadian
pool
taking
place
prior
to
the
four-year
period.
the
period
--
the
prior
period
during
which
the
canadian
pool
is
supposed
to
have
interfered
with
zenith’s
operations
began
in
1926.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
i
will
come
--
i
might
as
well
go
to
that
right
directly
now.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fact
is
that
the
defenses
of
statute
of
limitations
and
the
defenses
of
the
september
27,
1957
releases
were
raised
after
trial
and
after
findings,
but
before
entry
of
judgment.
at
that
time,
we
entered
the
litigation
and
moved
for
a
reopening.
we
moved
for
leave
to
plead
these
defenses.
that
leave
was
granted
and
we
have
outlined
the
circumstances,
the
events
and
the
statements
of
the
trial
court
at
pages
51
to
55
of
our
opening
brief.
the
leave
was
granted
to
plead
those
defenses.
they
were
pleaded.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
reciting
that
those
defenses
had
been
pleaded.
the
motion
was
overruled,
obviously
for
the
reason
that
the
trial
court
felt
that
the
defenses
had
no
merit.
as
this
court
said,
the
trial
court
apparently
felt
it
was
immaterial
as
to
whether
the
damage
causing
acts
had
taken
place
during
the
period
or
prior
to
the
period.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
zenith
itself
has
admitted
both
in
its
reply
brief
on
the
original,
the
first
appeal
and
in
this
appeal
that
we
were
granted
leave
to
file
the
defenses,
that
the
defenses
were
overruled
on
the
merits
or
were
held
to
have
no
merit.
and
for
that
reason,
the
final
judgment
was
entered
as
to
canada,
and
i
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice,
i
think
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
point
for
example
to
the
granger
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
a
similar
suggestion
was
made,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
second
circuit
that
said
the
record
speaks
and
it
says
that
leave
was
granted.
that
is
on
the
record,
leave
was
granted
to
file
these
defenses,
and
i
suggest
that
the
record
speaks
the
fact
and
that
that
is
the
record
before
this
court.
in
that
connection,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
court
also,
based
on
the
same
motion,
did
grant
us
partial
relief
in
the
case
of
england
and
australia
and
permitted
to
limit
its
reopening
and
the
result
of
that
of
course
was
that
the
claims
there
were
completely
disposed
of.
but
the
motion,
we
had
a
single
motion
directed
to
all
of
these
matters
which
we
submitted
to
the
trial
court
should
be
permitted
by
reason
of
the
fact
among
others
that
the
proposed
judgment
of
almost
14
--
49
million,
which
is
so
devastating
and
would’ve
have
been
so
fatal
that
in
the
interest
of
justice
that
the
trial
court
in
its
discretion
should
permit
these
things
to
be
done.
now,
this
court
in
its
first
opinion
pointed
out
specifically
that
the
damage
award
as
to
canada
had
been
based
on
the
assumption
not
only
that
there
had
been
wrongful
conduct
during
the
period,
but
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
wrongful
conduct
during
the
prior
years,
1926
to
1959,
and
that
zenith
had
been
damaged
by
those
prior
acts.
in
fact,
the
opinion
here
specifically
pointed
out
that
zenith
asserted
it
should
have
had
16%
share
of
the
canadian
television
market
at
the
beginning
of
that
period,
of
the
four-year
period,
that
zenith’s
claim
it
should
have
had
13%
share
of
the
radio
market
but
for
pool
activities,
instead
of
which
it
had
3%
of
television
and
4%
of
radio.
and
accordingly,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
a
portion
of
the
damage
award
and
i
submit,
a
very
large
portion
was
necessarily
based
on
the
pre-damage
period
conduct
of
the
pool
during
the
period
1926
to
1959.
and
on
remand,
pursuant
to
remand
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
the
defenses
of
release
and
limitations
were
in
the
case,
and
did
hold
that
they
barred
recovery
of
damages
suffered
during
the
damage
period
by
reason
of
these
pre-damage
period
and
pre-release
period
acts.
and
that
accordingly
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
trial
court
so
that
they
might
be
excluded,
that
portion
of
the
original
award
which
was
based
on
pre-damage
period
conduct
and
so
that
the
award
might
be
limited
to
damages
resulting
from
conduct
occurring
during
the
damage
period.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
assuming
that
it
started
with
its
actual
market
share
at
the
beginning?
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
if
that
is
--
if
that
fact
is
established
on
remand,
yes.
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
it’s
--
it
is
not
established,
i
submit
mr.
justice,
because
the
figures
that
we
have
now
start
with
16%
of
the
television
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
it
can
be
automated
at
some
day
in
the
future.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
it
is
--
the
record
shows
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
we
--
we
have
taken
the
position
below
that
the
two
markets
are
not
truly
comparable.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
as
i
see
the
litigation
up
to
now,
the
thing
that
is
established
is
that
zenith
did
have
a
3%
market
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
and
4%
as
to
television,
and
prima
facie,
the
record
--
the
court
below
has
said
in
effect
that
assuming
that
zenith
began
back
in
1926
on
radio
and
in
1948
on
television,
which
is
when
they
began
in
the
us
market
that
the
evidence
indicates
a
prima
facie,
that
in
that
span
of
years
under
those
conditions,
they
could’ve
done
the
same
in
canada
as
in
the
united
states.
the
record
does
indicate
that.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
you
mean
within
--
starting
at
3%,
we
most
firmly
say
mr.
justice
that
that
would
be
seriously
in
contention
because
zenith’s
own
proof
--
for
example,
let’s
take
television.
zenith’s
own
proof
is
that
starting
in
the
united
states
when
they
started
as
a
new
competitor
that
by
1959,
after
ten
years,
they
had
gotten
16%
in
the
canadian
market.
their
own
proof
is
that
starting
in
the
united
states
in
the
‘20’s
in
radio
and
over
a
span
of
over
30
years,
they
had
gotten
up
and
they’re
taking
that
long
to
get
up
to
13%
of
the
radio
market.
and
in
canada,
they
are
not
in
new
entrant,
the
conditions
are
different,
and
i
most
firmly
submit
that
to
think
that
zenith
could’ve
have
started
in
1959
with
its
3%
share
of
the
television
market
and
4%
of
the
radio
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
starting
with
3%
in
a
free
market?
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice,
your
--
your
question
i
think
begs
one
of
the
additional
questions
that
must
be
asked.
you
say,
“do
you
think
that
on
the
facts
in
this
record,”
there
are
no
facts
on
this
record
on
which
you
could
assume
that
based
on
3%
at
the
beginning
of
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
then
what
they
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
assuming
it
started
with
3%?
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
i
have
no
legal
basis
just
to
say
that
they
could
not
recover
the
7%.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
this
court
has
already
ruled
in
its
first
opinion
that
the
continuation
of
the
pool
during
the
four-year
period
with
a
continued
policy
against
licensing
of
imports
had
an
impact
on
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
read
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion
that
way
at
all.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
--
no
sir
because
we
are
bound
by
the
opinion
of
this
court,
and
this
court
has
ruled,
as
i
understand,
as
i
just
started.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
now,
i’d
like
to
go
briefly
to
the
point
of
the
release,
which
zenith’s
counsel
suggests
number
one,
can
have
no
application
and
number
two,
if
so
would
involve
a
violation
of
law.
the
counsel
asks,
how
can
this
release
executed
in
1957,
have
any
conceivable
bearing
on
the
damages
which
were
suffered
after
1957.
the
answer
is
of
course,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
that
this
release
by
its
terms
released
all
past,
present,
and
future
claims,
causes
of
action,
etcetera,
which
might
have
resulted
or
might
thereafter
result
from
acts,
conduct
prior
to
the
release
namely
up
to
the
day
or
the
day
to
these
presents,
the
usual
language.
now
zenith
argues
that
if
this
release
has
such
an
effect,
it
is
against
public
policy.
and
in
its
brief
as
urged
for
example,
the
fox
midwest
theatre's
case,
which
came
out
of
the
eight
circuit,
now
that
case
held
that
it
would
be
against
public
policy
and
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
to
permit
a
release
which
covered
future
damages
based
on
future
violations
of
the
sherman
act
because
that
obviously
would
be
an
encouragement
to
and
in
fact
to
some
extent
a
license
for
future
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
but
in
this
case,
all
we
have
here,
and
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
release
which
covers
damages
suffered
in
the
future
as
--
by
reason
of
past
acts.
it
covers
that
and
it
covers
nothing
more
it
purports
to
cover
nothing
more.
and
it
must
be
quite
obvious
that
when
zenith
asserts
that
it
was
the
conduct
of
the
pool
over
the
period
from
1926
to
may
22,
1959
that
prevented
zenith
from
building
up
to
this
16%
and
14%
share
of
the
market,
which
it
would’ve
enjoyed
during
this
period.
it
must
be
quite
obvious
i
submit
that
the
major
portion
of
that
conduct
between
1926
and
1959
which
interfered
with
the
pool
build
up
had
occurred
prior
to
september
27,
1957.
in
fact,
zenith’s
evidence
in
this
case
was
largely
testimony
and
documents
as
concerns
early
affairs.
i
would
say
finally
on
the
subject
of
the
releases
that
zenith
itself
has
admitted
to
the
trial
court
that,
hri
hazeltine
research
has
the
benefit
of
the
releases
because
when
we
brought
up
the
question
at
the
reopening
hearing,
the
court
asked,
“what
is
your
reply
to
his
contention
that
the
1957
release
also
released
hazeltine
from
anything
prior
to
the
day
of
the
releases?”
answer:
“well,
any
money
damages
which
had
accrued
prior
to
1957,
if
they
were
joint
tortfeasor,
which
we
allege
they
were,
would
be
released.
but
we
are
not
asking
for
damages
prior
to
19”
--
then
the
court,
“you’ve
answered
my
question.”
and
then
zen
--
zenith’s
counsel
went
on
to
argue
this
contention
about
future
damages
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
policy
and
so
forth.
but
the
application
of
the
release
to
hri
as
an
alleged
joint
tortfeasor
is
clear.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
the
release,
if
that
less
than
49%
subsidiary
was
an
alleged
co-conspirator,
it
would
apply.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
it
would
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
mr.
justice,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
release
not
only
released
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
but
was
also
a
general
release,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
to
apply
it
to
the
general
--
to
apply
the
general
releases
to
the
parents
and
subsidiaries.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
to
--
in
order
to
define
them
--
to
include
them
under
the
general
release,
but
absent
any
mention,
if
they
were
in
fact
co-conspirators,
they
would
have
the
benefit.
now
as
to
the
subject
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
and
the
contention
that
it
does
not
apply
on
the
ground,
zenith
asserts
that
no
cause
of
action
accrued
until
after
the
actual
damages
were
suffered.
i
submit
that
zenith’s
argument
here
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
long
established
legal
principles,
not
only
in
the
application
in
antitrust
cases,
but
generally
in
the
law.
those
principles
are
that
a
cause
of
action
accrues
when
it
can
first
be
brought.
and
in
the
case
of
sherman
act
violations
as
well
as
on
other
fields
of
law,
the
action
can
be
brought
--
and
in
the
case
of
sherman
act
violations,
when
the
wrongful
conduct
has
an
impact
on
the
business
of
the
plaintiff
or
on
his
property.
that
is
when
there
has
been
an
invasion
of
his
rights.
at
that
time,
he
has
a
cause
of
action
not
only
for
the
damages
he
has
already
suffered,
but
for
the
damages
he
is
likely
to
suffer,
is
reasonably
certain
to
suffer
in
the
future
as
the
result
of
that
impact.
now
zenith’s
counsel
has
referred
to
the
fact
of
constant
invasions,
namely
that
there
was
admittedly
impact,
wrongful
conduct
during
the
period,
but
all
that
amounts
to,
is
that
zenith
would
therefore
have
additional
causes
of
action
for
the
damages
caused
by
the
damage
period
conduct.
and
in
fact,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
and
this
court
recognized
that
zenith
does
have
a
cause
of
action
for
the
damages
caused
during
the
period.
but
as
to
the
damages
resulting
from
the
previous
acts,
it
had
its
cause
of
action
for
past
and
future
damages
more
than
four
years
ago.
it
did
not
sue
and
therefore,
its
claim
based
on
the
prior
conduct
is
barred.
now
i
have
said
that
this
is
a
well
settled
principle.
we
have
cited
a
number
of
antitrust
cases
in
our
briefs
on
this
at
pages
40
to
41
of
our
opening
brief,
13
to
--
on
pages
10
to
13
of
our
reply.
i
would
like
to
add
a
case
that
zenith
cited
in
its
reply
brief,
the
dairy
foods
case
which
also
enunciated
the
principle
that
you
can
recover
future
damages
without
waiting
for
the
time
to
pass
during
which
those
damages
would
be
suffered.
this
is
like
saying
to
a
personal
injury
plaintiff
who
has
lost
a
leg
and
can
no
longer
pursue
his
livelihood,
“oh
no,
you
may
not
sue
for
future
loss
of
income.
you
must
wait
year
after
year
as
you
lose
the
income
and
you
must
file
suit
year
after
year.”
that
i
submit
to
this
court
is
not
the
law,
and
what
zenith
is
really
doing
here
is
attempting
to
subvert
the
effect
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
which
says
the
cause
of
action
must
be
brought
within
four
years
from
the
time
it
accrues,
or
it
is
barred.
by
attempting
a
redefinition
of
the
cause
of
action,
which
in
fact
would
fly
right
in
the
face
of
the
statute
itself
because
the
law
has
long
been
settled
and
was
so
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
section
4
(b)
that
when
there
is
an
impact,
you
can
sue
both
for
damages
already
suffered
and
for
those
which
are
reasonably
anticipated
to
be
suffered
in
the
future.
now
i
think
that
possibly,
the
best
way
to
summarize
this
point
is
to
read
two
sentences
from
the
momand
case,
which
is
an
antitrust
case.
this
is
a
quotation
from
a
district
court
but
the
case
was
affirmed
by
the
first
circuit
and
certiorari
denied
in
1949,
and
i
read,
“each
time
a
plaintiff’s
interest
is
invaded
by
an
act
of
the
defendant’s,
he
has
a
new
cause
of
action.
for
that
particular
invasion,
he
is
at
once
entitled
to
recover
as
damages
not
only
for
the
injuries
he
suffers
at
once,
but
also
for
those
he
will
suffer
in
the
future
from
that
particular
invasion,
including
what
he
has
suffered
during
and
will
suffer
after
the
trial,”
quoting
the
order
below,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
235
u.s.
now
finally,
i
would
like
to
go
to
this
contention
that
has
been
made
concerning
uncertainty
as
to
damages
and
somehow
it
is
suggestive
that
our
position
is
contrary
to
the
bigelow
case.
now
the
bigelow
case
has
said
that
if
it
is
established
that
the
damage
is
--
some
damages
have
been
suffered
by
reason
of
unlawful
acts
and
if
there
is
an
uncertainty
as
to
whether
those
damages
result
from
that
unlawful
conduct
or
may
result
from
other
conduct
that
that
uncertainty
will
be
resolved
against
the
defendant
who
may
have
created
the
uncertainty.
but
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
uncertainty.
that
the
amount
of
damages
resulting
from
damage
period
conduct
are
ascertainable.
this
court
itself
has
said
that
a
portion
of
the
award
necessarily
results
from
pre-damage
period
conduct.
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
award
was
based
on
the
assumption
of
a
16%
share
as
to
television,
when
in
fact
the
share
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
was
3%.
thus,
it
is
obvious
that
13%
out
of
that
initial
16%
claim
resulted
from
pre-damage
period
conduct.
the
same
is
true
on
radio
where
the
assumed
share
was
13%
and
the
actual
share
was
4%.
it
is
obvious
that
9/13th
of
the
original
assumed
share
traced
to
pre-damage
period
conduct.
it
could
trace
to
nothing
else.
and
the
way
that
this
thing
would
be
resolved
is
to
start
on
a
remand
with
a
3%
share
of
television
and
the
4%
share
of
radio,
put
in
your
relevant
estimates,
make
your
determination
through
experts
--
marketing
experts,
company
officials,
whoever
is
qualified
to
determine
what
zenith
could
have
achieved
during
the
four
years
in
a
free
market,
starting
with
its
actual
3%
and
4%
share,
apply
those
percentages
to
volume,
apply
to
profit,
and
subtract
the
share
and
the
profits
that
zenith
actually
achieved.
and
the
difference
would
be
clearly
and
ascertainably,
with
reasonable
certainty,
the
difference
would
be
zenith’s
damages.
and
we
submit
that
under
this
state
of
facts
when
so
great
a
portion
of
this
$19
million,
this
devastating
$19
million
is
obviously
based
on
pre-damage
period
conduct,
we
submit
that
the
clear
road
to
be
followed
here
is
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
below
so
that
there
may
be
a
determination,
so
that
there
may
be
a
fixing
of
the
amount
which
zenith
actually
suffered
based
on
conduct
during
the
four-year
period,
and
then
bring
the
litigation
to
an
end.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
propose
to
spend
my
half
hour
primarily
answering
the
assertions
made
by
zenith’s
counsel
but
i
would
like
first
to
give
a
brief
background
against
which
this
discussion
may
be
conducted.
zenith
counsel
stated
correctly
the
issue
here
involves
the
amount
of
damages
recoverable
by
zenith,
and
zenith’s
right
to
recover
some
damages
is
not
in
dispute.
this
court
ruled
on
the
prior
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
recognized
on
remand
that
zenith
is
entitled
to
recover
those
damages
flowing
from
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
canadian
patent
pool
taking
place
during
the
four-year
period,
may
22,
1959
to
may
22,
1963.
but
the
question
which
remains
is
whether
zenith
is
entitled
to
recover
those
damages
suffered
during
the
four-year
period
but
as
a
result
of
acts
of
the
canadian
pool
taking
place
prior
to
the
four-year
period.
the
period
--
the
prior
period
during
which
the
canadian
pool
is
supposed
to
have
interfered
with
zenith’s
operations
began
in
1926.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes,
i
will
come
--
i
might
as
well
go
to
that
right
directly
now.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fact
is
that
the
defenses
of
statute
of
limitations
and
the
defenses
of
the
september
27,
1957
releases
were
raised
after
trial
and
after
findings,
but
before
entry
of
judgment.
at
that
time,
we
entered
the
litigation
and
moved
for
a
reopening.
we
moved
for
leave
to
plead
these
defenses.
that
leave
was
granted
and
we
have
outlined
the
circumstances,
the
events
and
the
statements
of
the
trial
court
at
pages
51
to
55
of
our
opening
brief.
the
leave
was
granted
to
plead
those
defenses.
they
were
pleaded.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
reciting
that
those
defenses
had
been
pleaded.
the
motion
was
overruled,
obviously
for
the
reason
that
the
trial
court
felt
that
the
defenses
had
no
merit.
as
this
court
said,
the
trial
court
apparently
felt
it
was
immaterial
as
to
whether
the
damage
causing
acts
had
taken
place
during
the
period
or
prior
to
the
period.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
zenith
itself
has
admitted
both
in
its
reply
brief
on
the
original,
the
first
appeal
and
in
this
appeal
that
we
were
granted
leave
to
file
the
defenses,
that
the
defenses
were
overruled
on
the
merits
or
were
held
to
have
no
merit.
and
for
that
reason,
the
final
judgment
was
entered
as
to
canada,
and
i
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice,
i
think
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
point
for
example
to
the
granger
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
a
similar
suggestion
was
made,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
second
circuit
that
said
the
record
speaks
and
it
says
that
leave
was
granted.
that
is
on
the
record,
leave
was
granted
to
file
these
defenses,
and
i
suggest
that
the
record
speaks
the
fact
and
that
that
is
the
record
before
this
court.
in
that
connection,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
court
also,
based
on
the
same
motion,
did
grant
us
partial
relief
in
the
case
of
england
and
australia
and
permitted
to
limit
its
reopening
and
the
result
of
that
of
course
was
that
the
claims
there
were
completely
disposed
of.
but
the
motion,
we
had
a
single
motion
directed
to
all
of
these
matters
which
we
submitted
to
the
trial
court
should
be
permitted
by
reason
of
the
fact
among
others
that
the
proposed
judgment
of
almost
14
--
49
million,
which
is
so
devastating
and
would’ve
have
been
so
fatal
that
in
the
interest
of
justice
that
the
trial
court
in
its
discretion
should
permit
these
things
to
be
done.
now,
this
court
in
its
first
opinion
pointed
out
specifically
that
the
damage
award
as
to
canada
had
been
based
on
the
assumption
not
only
that
there
had
been
wrongful
conduct
during
the
period,
but
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
wrongful
conduct
during
the
prior
years,
1926
to
1959,
and
that
zenith
had
been
damaged
by
those
prior
acts.
in
fact,
the
opinion
here
specifically
pointed
out
that
zenith
asserted
it
should
have
had
16%
share
of
the
canadian
television
market
at
the
beginning
of
that
period,
of
the
four-year
period,
that
zenith’s
claim
it
should
have
had
13%
share
of
the
radio
market
but
for
pool
activities,
instead
of
which
it
had
3%
of
television
and
4%
of
radio.
and
accordingly,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
a
portion
of
the
damage
award
and
i
submit,
a
very
large
portion
was
necessarily
based
on
the
pre-damage
period
conduct
of
the
pool
during
the
period
1926
to
1959.
and
on
remand,
pursuant
to
remand
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
the
defenses
of
release
and
limitations
were
in
the
case,
and
did
hold
that
they
barred
recovery
of
damages
suffered
during
the
damage
period
by
reason
of
these
pre-damage
period
and
pre-release
period
acts.
and
that
accordingly
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
trial
court
so
that
they
might
be
excluded,
that
portion
of
the
original
award
which
was
based
on
pre-damage
period
conduct
and
so
that
the
award
might
be
limited
to
damages
resulting
from
conduct
occurring
during
the
damage
period.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
assuming
that
it
started
with
its
actual
market
share
at
the
beginning?
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
if
that
is
--
if
that
fact
is
established
on
remand,
yes.
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
yes.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
it’s
--
it
is
not
established,
i
submit
mr.
justice,
because
the
figures
that
we
have
now
start
with
16%
of
the
television
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
it
can
be
automated
at
some
day
in
the
future.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
it
is
--
the
record
shows
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
we
--
we
have
taken
the
position
below
that
the
two
markets
are
not
truly
comparable.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
as
i
see
the
litigation
up
to
now,
the
thing
that
is
established
is
that
zenith
did
have
a
3%
market
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
and
4%
as
to
television,
and
prima
facie,
the
record
--
the
court
below
has
said
in
effect
that
assuming
that
zenith
began
back
in
1926
on
radio
and
in
1948
on
television,
which
is
when
they
began
in
the
us
market
that
the
evidence
indicates
a
prima
facie,
that
in
that
span
of
years
under
those
conditions,
they
could’ve
done
the
same
in
canada
as
in
the
united
states.
the
record
does
indicate
that.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
you
mean
within
--
starting
at
3%,
we
most
firmly
say
mr.
justice
that
that
would
be
seriously
in
contention
because
zenith’s
own
proof
--
for
example,
let’s
take
television.
zenith’s
own
proof
is
that
starting
in
the
united
states
when
they
started
as
a
new
competitor
that
by
1959,
after
ten
years,
they
had
gotten
16%
in
the
canadian
market.
their
own
proof
is
that
starting
in
the
united
states
in
the
‘20’s
in
radio
and
over
a
span
of
over
30
years,
they
had
gotten
up
and
they’re
taking
that
long
to
get
up
to
13%
of
the
radio
market.
and
in
canada,
they
are
not
in
new
entrant,
the
conditions
are
different,
and
i
most
firmly
submit
that
to
think
that
zenith
could’ve
have
started
in
1959
with
its
3%
share
of
the
television
market
and
4%
of
the
radio
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
starting
with
3%
in
a
free
market?
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice,
your
--
your
question
i
think
begs
one
of
the
additional
questions
that
must
be
asked.
you
say,
“do
you
think
that
on
the
facts
in
this
record,”
there
are
no
facts
on
this
record
on
which
you
could
assume
that
based
on
3%
at
the
beginning
of
the
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
then
what
they
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
assuming
it
started
with
3%?
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
no,
i
have
no
legal
basis
just
to
say
that
they
could
not
recover
the
7%.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
this
court
has
already
ruled
in
its
first
opinion
that
the
continuation
of
the
pool
during
the
four-year
period
with
a
continued
policy
against
licensing
of
imports
had
an
impact
on
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
read
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion
that
way
at
all.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
i
--
no
sir
because
we
are
bound
by
the
opinion
of
this
court,
and
this
court
has
ruled,
as
i
understand,
as
i
just
started.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
now,
i’d
like
to
go
briefly
to
the
point
of
the
release,
which
zenith’s
counsel
suggests
number
one,
can
have
no
application
and
number
two,
if
so
would
involve
a
violation
of
law.
the
counsel
asks,
how
can
this
release
executed
in
1957,
have
any
conceivable
bearing
on
the
damages
which
were
suffered
after
1957.
the
answer
is
of
course,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
that
this
release
by
its
terms
released
all
past,
present,
and
future
claims,
causes
of
action,
etcetera,
which
might
have
resulted
or
might
thereafter
result
from
acts,
conduct
prior
to
the
release
namely
up
to
the
day
or
the
day
to
these
presents,
the
usual
language.
now
zenith
argues
that
if
this
release
has
such
an
effect,
it
is
against
public
policy.
and
in
its
brief
as
urged
for
example,
the
fox
midwest
theatre's
case,
which
came
out
of
the
eight
circuit,
now
that
case
held
that
it
would
be
against
public
policy
and
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
to
permit
a
release
which
covered
future
damages
based
on
future
violations
of
the
sherman
act
because
that
obviously
would
be
an
encouragement
to
and
in
fact
to
some
extent
a
license
for
future
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
but
in
this
case,
all
we
have
here,
and
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
release
which
covers
damages
suffered
in
the
future
as
--
by
reason
of
past
acts.
it
covers
that
and
it
covers
nothing
more
it
purports
to
cover
nothing
more.
and
it
must
be
quite
obvious
that
when
zenith
asserts
that
it
was
the
conduct
of
the
pool
over
the
period
from
1926
to
may
22,
1959
that
prevented
zenith
from
building
up
to
this
16%
and
14%
share
of
the
market,
which
it
would’ve
enjoyed
during
this
period.
it
must
be
quite
obvious
i
submit
that
the
major
portion
of
that
conduct
between
1926
and
1959
which
interfered
with
the
pool
build
up
had
occurred
prior
to
september
27,
1957.
in
fact,
zenith’s
evidence
in
this
case
was
largely
testimony
and
documents
as
concerns
early
affairs.
i
would
say
finally
on
the
subject
of
the
releases
that
zenith
itself
has
admitted
to
the
trial
court
that,
hri
hazeltine
research
has
the
benefit
of
the
releases
because
when
we
brought
up
the
question
at
the
reopening
hearing,
the
court
asked,
“what
is
your
reply
to
his
contention
that
the
1957
release
also
released
hazeltine
from
anything
prior
to
the
day
of
the
releases?”
answer:
“well,
any
money
damages
which
had
accrued
prior
to
1957,
if
they
were
joint
tortfeasor,
which
we
allege
they
were,
would
be
released.
but
we
are
not
asking
for
damages
prior
to
19”
--
then
the
court,
“you’ve
answered
my
question.”
and
then
zen
--
zenith’s
counsel
went
on
to
argue
this
contention
about
future
damages
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
public
policy
and
so
forth.
but
the
application
of
the
release
to
hri
as
an
alleged
joint
tortfeasor
is
clear.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
the
release,
if
that
less
than
49%
subsidiary
was
an
alleged
co-conspirator,
it
would
apply.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
it
would
--
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well
mr.
justice,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
release
not
only
released
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
but
was
also
a
general
release,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
to
apply
it
to
the
general
--
to
apply
the
general
releases
to
the
parents
and
subsidiaries.
mr.
victor
p.
kayser
well,
to
--
in
order
to
define
them
--
to
include
them
under
the
general
release,
but
absent
any
mention,
if
they
were
in
fact
co-conspirators,
they
would
have
the
benefit.
now
as
to
the
subject
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
and
the
contention
that
it
does
not
apply
on
the
ground,
zenith
asserts
that
no
cause
of
action
accrued
until
after
the
actual
damages
were
suffered.
i
submit
that
zenith’s
argument
here
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
long
established
legal
principles,
not
only
in
the
application
in
antitrust
cases,
but
generally
in
the
law.
those
principles
are
that
a
cause
of
action
accrues
when
it
can
first
be
brought.
and
in
the
case
of
sherman
act
violations
as
well
as
on
other
fields
of
law,
the
action
can
be
brought
--
and
in
the
case
of
sherman
act
violations,
when
the
wrongful
conduct
has
an
impact
on
the
business
of
the
plaintiff
or
on
his
property.
that
is
when
there
has
been
an
invasion
of
his
rights.
at
that
time,
he
has
a
cause
of
action
not
only
for
the
damages
he
has
already
suffered,
but
for
the
damages
he
is
likely
to
suffer,
is
reasonably
certain
to
suffer
in
the
future
as
the
result
of
that
impact.
now
zenith’s
counsel
has
referred
to
the
fact
of
constant
invasions,
namely
that
there
was
admittedly
impact,
wrongful
conduct
during
the
period,
but
all
that
amounts
to,
is
that
zenith
would
therefore
have
additional
causes
of
action
for
the
damages
caused
by
the
damage
period
conduct.
and
in
fact,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
and
this
court
recognized
that
zenith
does
have
a
cause
of
action
for
the
damages
caused
during
the
period.
but
as
to
the
damages
resulting
from
the
previous
acts,
it
had
its
cause
of
action
for
past
and
future
damages
more
than
four
years
ago.
it
did
not
sue
and
therefore,
its
claim
based
on
the
prior
conduct
is
barred.
now
i
have
said
that
this
is
a
well
settled
principle.
we
have
cited
a
number
of
antitrust
cases
in
our
briefs
on
this
at
pages
40
to
41
of
our
opening
brief,
13
to
--
on
pages
10
to
13
of
our
reply.
i
would
like
to
add
a
case
that
zenith
cited
in
its
reply
brief,
the
dairy
foods
case
which
also
enunciated
the
principle
that
you
can
recover
future
damages
without
waiting
for
the
time
to
pass
during
which
those
damages
would
be
suffered.
this
is
like
saying
to
a
personal
injury
plaintiff
who
has
lost
a
leg
and
can
no
longer
pursue
his
livelihood,
“oh
no,
you
may
not
sue
for
future
loss
of
income.
you
must
wait
year
after
year
as
you
lose
the
income
and
you
must
file
suit
year
after
year.”
that
i
submit
to
this
court
is
not
the
law,
and
what
zenith
is
really
doing
here
is
attempting
to
subvert
the
effect
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
which
says
the
cause
of
action
must
be
brought
within
four
years
from
the
time
it
accrues,
or
it
is
barred.
by
attempting
a
redefinition
of
the
cause
of
action,
which
in
fact
would
fly
right
in
the
face
of
the
statute
itself
because
the
law
has
long
been
settled
and
was
so
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
section
4
(b)
that
when
there
is
an
impact,
you
can
sue
both
for
damages
already
suffered
and
for
those
which
are
reasonably
anticipated
to
be
suffered
in
the
future.
now
i
think
that
possibly,
the
best
way
to
summarize
this
point
is
to
read
two
sentences
from
the
momand
case,
which
is
an
antitrust
case.
this
is
a
quotation
from
a
district
court
but
the
case
was
affirmed
by
the
first
circuit
and
certiorari
denied
in
1949,
and
i
read,
“each
time
a
plaintiff’s
interest
is
invaded
by
an
act
of
the
defendant’s,
he
has
a
new
cause
of
action.
for
that
particular
invasion,
he
is
at
once
entitled
to
recover
as
damages
not
only
for
the
injuries
he
suffers
at
once,
but
also
for
those
he
will
suffer
in
the
future
from
that
particular
invasion,
including
what
he
has
suffered
during
and
will
suffer
after
the
trial,”
quoting
the
order
below,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
235
u.s.
now
finally,
i
would
like
to
go
to
this
contention
that
has
been
made
concerning
uncertainty
as
to
damages
and
somehow
it
is
suggestive
that
our
position
is
contrary
to
the
bigelow
case.
now
the
bigelow
case
has
said
that
if
it
is
established
that
the
damage
is
--
some
damages
have
been
suffered
by
reason
of
unlawful
acts
and
if
there
is
an
uncertainty
as
to
whether
those
damages
result
from
that
unlawful
conduct
or
may
result
from
other
conduct
that
that
uncertainty
will
be
resolved
against
the
defendant
who
may
have
created
the
uncertainty.
but
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
uncertainty.
that
the
amount
of
damages
resulting
from
damage
period
conduct
are
ascertainable.
this
court
itself
has
said
that
a
portion
of
the
award
necessarily
results
from
pre-damage
period
conduct.
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
award
was
based
on
the
assumption
of
a
16%
share
as
to
television,
when
in
fact
the
share
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
was
3%.
thus,
it
is
obvious
that
13%
out
of
that
initial
16%
claim
resulted
from
pre-damage
period
conduct.
the
same
is
true
on
radio
where
the
assumed
share
was
13%
and
the
actual
share
was
4%.
it
is
obvious
that
9/13th
of
the
original
assumed
share
traced
to
pre-damage
period
conduct.
it
could
trace
to
nothing
else.
and
the
way
that
this
thing
would
be
resolved
is
to
start
on
a
remand
with
a
3%
share
of
television
and
the
4%
share
of
radio,
put
in
your
relevant
estimates,
make
your
determination
through
experts
--
marketing
experts,
company
officials,
whoever
is
qualified
to
determine
what
zenith
could
have
achieved
during
the
four
years
in
a
free
market,
starting
with
its
actual
3%
and
4%
share,
apply
those
percentages
to
volume,
apply
to
profit,
and
subtract
the
share
and
the
profits
that
zenith
actually
achieved.
and
the
difference
would
be
clearly
and
ascertainably,
with
reasonable
certainty,
the
difference
would
be
zenith’s
damages.
and
we
submit
that
under
this
state
of
facts
when
so
great
a
portion
of
this
$19
million,
this
devastating
$19
million
is
obviously
based
on
pre-damage
period
conduct,
we
submit
that
the
clear
road
to
be
followed
here
is
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
below
so
that
there
may
be
a
determination,
so
that
there
may
be
a
fixing
of
the
amount
which
zenith
actually
suffered
based
on
conduct
during
the
four-year
period,
and
then
bring
the
litigation
to
an
end.
