mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
under
the
existing
law
it
would
be
the
united
states
government.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well,
i
would
say
the
legal
owner
under
the
trust
theory.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
the
legal
title
of
course
is
in
the
holder
of
funds
and
the
equitable
title
would
be
in
the
united
states
government.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
oh!
if
the
act
had
been
repealed.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i'm
sorry.
if
the
act
had
been
appealed,
i
think
then
that
the
equitable
title
would
be
in
the
employees.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
--
if
the
law
were
repealed?
yes.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
but
we're
now
talking
about
a
bankruptcy
proceedings.
i
understood
mr.
chief
justice
to
be
talking
about
in
any
given
situation
exclusive
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well,
i
would
say
that
once
the
case
is
in
the
bankruptcy
court
either
by
a
chapter
proceedings
or
by
an
adjudication,
then
the
entire
bankruptcy
act
prevails
and
then
the
systems
of
priorities
are
set
forth
by
section
64.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
if
this
law
were
rescinded
or
if
it
were
repealed,
or
if
the
courts
were
to
strike
it
down
and
there
were
no
bankruptcy
then
i
think
there'll
be
no
question
as
to
where
it
would
go.
the
equitable
title
would
be
in
the
employees.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
think
by
the
nature
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
i
believe
that
the
trust
company
is
specifically
excluded
by
the
act.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
all
hypothetical,
assuming
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that
it
went,
so
i
understand
you
fully
that
it
--
the
trust
company
became
insolvent
or
bankrupt.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
at
all
that
the
bankruptcy
act
would
prevail
assuming
that
it
did
go
and
come
in
the
bankruptcy
act
either
voluntarily
or
involuntarily.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
in
so
far
as
i
understand
trust
companies,
they
hold
some
of
them
in
trust
pools
where
they
commingle
funds.
(voice
overlap)
i
think
they
get
a
different
problem
there.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
or
the
individual.
well
then
again,
i
think
you
have
an
entirely
different
situation
here.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes.
the
government
seems
to
be
relying
rather
heavily
upon
the
trust
fund
theory
and
the
theory
of
trust
and
trust
ex
mal
officio
and
question
why
the
seventh
circuit
court
did
not
address
itself
to
this.
and
i
think
it's
very
obvious
that
the
reason
why
the
seventh
circuit
court
did
not
address
itself
to
this
particular
argument
of
the
government,
is
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
it
to
do
so
because
the
court
there
interpreted
section
64
(a)
to
the
same
as
the
connecticut
general
case
did
and
the
same
as
the
green
case
is
that
number
one,
they
were
not
in
conflict
with
one
another
that
section
7501
(a)
and
64
(a)
(1)
could
be
read
separately
and
by
the
second
sentence
in
7501
(a),
it
provided
that
the
trust
have
the
same
limitations
on
it
as
the
taxes
from
which
the
fund
arose
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
taxes
arose
from
and
by
virtue
with
the
bankruptcy
act
and
therefore
the
bankruptcy
act
would
prevail
and
there
goes
section
64
(a).
but
further,
if
these
were
not
the
case,
that
the
strong
policy
of
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
would
prevail
over
the
general
provisions
and
the
general
policy
of
section
7501.
i
would
like
to
review
rather
briefly
the
history
of
these
cases
starting
out
with
the
guaranty
title
company
case,
an
opinion
in
1912
where
the
section
3466
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provided
for
a
priority
as
opposed
to
7501
which
provides
for
trust
fund.
there
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
a
beneficent
policy
that
64
(a)
should
prevail
especially
in
that
case
that
pertain
to
wage
earners.
this
was
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
davis
versus
pringle
in
1925.
now,
this
line
of
cases
goes
undisturbed
up
until
the
time
of
u.s.
versus
nicholas
or
nicholas
versus
u.s.
which
was
decided
in
this
court
in
1964.
the
problem
arises
with
the
line
of
cases
under
the
city
of
new
york
versus
rassner
and
then
the
rassner
case.
the
first
case
in
1942
in
which
this
trust
fund
was
found
to
apply.
the
rassner
case
provided
or
the
rassner
case
said
that
it
was
a
general
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
section
64
(a)
as
opposed
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
trust.
and
the
rassner
case
went
on
to
say
that
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
policy
or
if
the
provisions
of
64
(a)
were
other
than
general
then
the
result
would
be
different.
and
this
court
has
shown
in
nicholas
versus
united
states
in
express
language
said
that
it
is
a
strong
policy
that
prevails
in
64
(a).
that
being
the
case
than
the
perhaps
fall
from
underneath
the
rassner
case
and
all
of
the
cases
that
follow
it
fall
like
dominoes.
this
is
the
theory
of
the
trustee.
this
has
been
the
position
of
the
trustee
from
its
very
--
the
very
inception
of
this
case.
in
the
nicholas
case,
the
court
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
taxes
that
were
incurred
during
the
chapter
xi,
and
this
is
precisely
what
we're
talking
about
here,
come
within
the
first
priorities
of
section
64,
the
bankruptcy
act.
that
is
the
cost
of
administration.
the
history
of
the
administrative
and
cost
of
administration
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
have
constantly
worked
towards
allowance
across
of
administration
and
the
way
from
tax
collecting.
when
you
trace
the
history
in
the
bankruptcy
act
is
enacted
in
1800
and
1841,
1867
and
1898.
all
gave
top
priority
to
taxes.
it
wasn't
until
1926
that
the
priorities
were
changed,
the
cost
of
administration
was
advanced
and
that
the
taxes
were
reduced
to
a
sixth
priority.
then
under
the
chandler
act
of
1938,
the
system
of
priorities
was
retained
and
further
the
tax
collector
was
further
restricted
but
being
required
to
file
this
claim
within
the
limitation
set
on
all
other
claimants.
and
again
in
1952,
the
act
was
again
amended
to
give
further
priority
to
cost
of
administration
by
providing
that
cost
of
administration
in
a
superseding
bankruptcy
takes
priority
over
the
cost
of
administration
in
the
superseded
chapter
proceedings,
further
strengthening
the
position
of
cost
of
administration.
and
lastly
in
1966,
the
most
recent
amendment
which
changed
the
priorities
further
or
limited
further
the
claim
for
taxes
by
holding
that
the
taxes
could
only
be
claimed
for
a
three-year
period
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy.
so
we
see
historically,
this
picture
of
the
reducing
of
the
tax
claim
in
advancing
the
cost
of
administration.
and
i
think
as
the
court
below
in
the
very
scholarly
opinion
by
mr.
justice
hastings
points
out
and
refers
to
the
congressional
or
rather
the
senate
reports
and
the
house
conference
reports
as
it
apply
to
the
cost
of
administration.
and
the
need
to
preserve
this
cost
of
administration
because
let's
take
just
what
could
happen
very
easily
in
this
case.
we
are
only
--
the
government
is
only
seeking
to
impress
the
trust
on
those
taxes
that
were
collected
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
but
if
you
were
to
read
section
7501
that
says
any
person
who
collects
taxes
that
would
also
mean
the
bankrupt
prior
to
filing.
further
and
following
the
rassner
line
of
cases,
if
you
have
every
state
and
every
municipality
enacting
trust
fund
legislation,
there's
nothing
left
to
administer
in
these
cases
or
were
still,
you
have
a
trustee
who
is
going
to
wait
and
to
see
if
anyone
is
going
to
assert
his
trust
rights
and
the
estate
is
going
to
go
unadministered
during
this
period
of
time.
and
as
the
house
reports
and
the
house
conference
report
and
the
senate
report,
i
believe
it
was
in
the
82nd
congress
emphasized
the
necessity
to
protect
the
trustee
in
order
to
have
orderly
administration
of
the
estate.
if
you
don't
protect
the
trustee,
if
you
don't
give
him
the
first
priority,
then
you
are
not
going
to
have
orderly
administration
of
estate
just
the
normal
routine
that's
employed
by
the
trustee.
first
of
all,
he
ceases
the
property
in
order
to
protect
it
and
so
doing
here
immediately
in
first
liabilities.
he's
got
to
post
the
bond
as
required
by
court.
he's
got
to
assume
rent
liabilities
for
use
in
occupancy.
he's
got
to
employ
inventory
clerks.
he
has
got
to
employ
appraiser
by
rule
of
court.
these
are
all
obligations
that
he
himself
must
pay.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
if
the
lien
has
been
perfected
the
same
as
any
lien
under
the
uniform
commercial
code.
if
it
has
been
perfected,
it
is
a
valid
and
subsisting
lien.
and
that
property
is
excluded
from
the
bankrupt
estate.
but
that's
by
separate
statute
though,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
usually
does
has
some
accommodation,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no
sir,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
mr.
justice
white.
the
usually
an
accommodation
is
worked
up.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
but
if
the
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well
i
--
you're
speaking
now
of
the
second
sentence
of
7501
(a).
well,
i
feel
that
after
the
interpretation
put
on
that
language
in
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case
and
the
green
case
and
also
in
this
case
in
the
court
below
is
that
the
trust
has
a
limitations
placed
upon
it
by
that
as
a
taxes
from
which
the
fund
arose
and
that
is
the
bankruptcy
act
and
therefore
the
bankruptcy
act
would
apply.
now,
i
think
in
the
hypothesis
that
you
gave
me
is
it
pertains
to
something
entirely
different
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
because
it
is
again
a
separate
statutory
procedure.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
there
is
none
sir.
they
did
not
protect
or
perfect
the
lien.
well,
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
white,
if
that
were
the
case,
the
trustee
wouldn't
take
possession
of
the
property
and
there
be
no
estate
to
administer.
he
would
file
a
“no
assets”
report
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
if
that's
all
the
assets
there
were,
certainly.
and
that
happens
in
any
number
of
cases
not
only
in
tax
liens,
but
on
uniform
commercial
code
liens.
this
is
very
common
place.
(voice
overlap)
but
there
you
have
it,
you
have
it
set
forth
with
clarity
in
the
law
and
if
they
have
protected
their
position,
then
there
is
nothing
to
administer
for
the
title
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
he
would
treat
that,
sir.
i
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
because
if
i
understand
you
mr.
justice
white,
you're
talking
about
funds
that
have
been
segregated.
that
there
any
withholding
tax
account
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
i
would
not
because
the
government
has
not
perfected
its
lien
rights
in
that
instance.
and
it
becomes
the
general
funds
of
the
estate.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
then
if
you
get
back
again
to
7401
and
64
(a),
where
does
the
priorities
lie?
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well,
i
think
you
have
a
different
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
exactly
what
we
did
sir
in
this
case.
what
we
did
--
let
me
change
that.
that's
exactly
the
way
the
trustee
treated
funds
that
were
on
deposit
in
the
bank
account
that
was
created
and
set
up
in
this
case
for
deposit
of
tax
moneys.
there
was
an
account
that
was
set
up
here.
and
i
refer
you
to
abstract
39
which
show
in
the
petition
that
when
the
president
of
the
corporation
was
questioned
about
the
assets,
he
said
that
a
bank
account
had
been
set
up
and
this
was
--
this
was
set
forth
in
the
petition
paragraph
1
in
abstract
44.
paragraph
1
of
the
referee's
orders
makes
an
order
with
reference
to
that
bank
account.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
precisely
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i'm
afraid
i
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
they
were
filed
during
the
chapter
xi
proceedings
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
he
deposited
them
in
a
special
account
in
the
state
bank
of
elk
grove
village
in
elk
grove,
illinois.
those
moneys
may
still
be
there
for
all
i
know.
we
exercise
no
jurisdiction
over
them.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
we're
talking
about
separate
funds
that
were
--
when
the
debtor
went
into
possession,
an
order
was
entered
ordering
him
to
open
up
three
accounts.
he
did
open
up
an
account
in
the
elk
grove
bank
for
the
purpose
of
withholding
taxes
and
fica
he
did
make
some
deposits
in
there.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
he
made
some
deposits.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
but
not
enough.
that's
right.
we
haven't
touched
these
funds.
we
had
--
we
don't
claim
that.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
make
no
claim.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
right.
and
they
want
to
impress
the
trust
on
property,
on
capital
assets
of
the
corporation
that
existed
long
before
the
chapter
xi
proceedings
and
in
no
way
traceable
and
there's
no
question
of
commingling.
there
is
no
question
of
trust
ex
mal
officio
as
it
provide
--
as
it
pertains
to
the
capital
funds.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
roughly
maybe
$200
to
$300.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
oh!
excuse
me,
the
total
amount
that
was
withheld
i'm
sorry
was
$10,075.52,
the
amount
that
was
deposited
that
was
maybe
$200
to
$300.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
the
government
wants
the
entire
sum.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
actually
that
would
be
it
and
would
be
whatever
is
in
that
account.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
the
wage
earners
at
least
to
the
extent
that
credit
is
given
to
them
for
the
moneys
that
should
have
been
deposited.
i
can't
see
in
no
way
at
all
that
the
estate
has
been
enhanced.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
you
mean
as
subrogees,
i
don't
know
any
statutory
provision.
i
know
of
no
case
law.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well
except
that
that
is
--
i
would
say
under
ordinary
circumstances,
i
would
have
to
buy
your
argument.
however,
i
feel
that
what
we're
here
before
this
court
to
interpret
is
the
effect
of
7501
and
that's
in
the
relationship
with
64
(a)
(1).
and
i'm
just
asking
the
court
to
follow
the
precedent
that's
here
before
have
been
sent
is
that
it
is
a
strong
policy
of
64
(a)
that
must
prevail
over
7501
if
there
is
a
conflict.
in
other
words,
this
7501
(a)
applies
up
until
the
moment
that
the
bankrupt
--
any
proceeding
on
bankruptcy
is
filed.
then
the
bankruptcy
act
takes
over
completely.
i
don't
think
you
can
have
the
bankruptcy
applied
just
piecemeal
and
have
collateral
legislation
that
is
going
to
interfere
with
the
administration
of
the
estates
which
is
what
7501
does
because
you're
in
real
serious
problems
when
it
comes
to
the
administration
of
estates.
if
you're
going
to
ask
a
trustee
whose
worth
is
sought
to
come
in
and
to
expend
money,
his
own
money
and
incur
personal
liabilities
and
not
know
whether
or
not
there
is
a
trust
that
is
going
to
be
exerted
by
the
united
states
government
and
i
suggest
later
on
if
the
court
is
to
reverse
the
courts
below.
all
the
municipalities
that
would
pass
that
legislation
and
all
the
states
that
would
pass
that
legislation
you
would
have
no
orderly
administration
of
the
estate
until
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
untangle
it.
now,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
irreparable
damage
done
to
the
system
during
that
hiatus.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir?
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
they
are
claiming
over
and
above
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
they
enjoy
a
fourth
priority
under
section
64
(a)
(1).
excuse
me,
no.
i'm
sorry.
they
enjoy
a
first
priority.
they
enjoy
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
administrative
expense
after
--
the
administrative
expense
of
the
proceeding
bankrupt.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
that
would
the
cost
of
administration.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
right.
they
do
enjoy
that
first
priority
with
the
subject
to
the
one
condition
that
i
stated.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes
sir,
but
i
think
the
principle
is
much
larger
than
that
what
could
be
done
to
the
entire
system.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
under
the
existing
law
it
would
be
the
united
states
government.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well,
i
would
say
the
legal
owner
under
the
trust
theory.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
the
legal
title
of
course
is
in
the
holder
of
funds
and
the
equitable
title
would
be
in
the
united
states
government.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
oh!
if
the
act
had
been
repealed.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i'm
sorry.
if
the
act
had
been
appealed,
i
think
then
that
the
equitable
title
would
be
in
the
employees.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
--
if
the
law
were
repealed?
yes.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
but
we're
now
talking
about
a
bankruptcy
proceedings.
i
understood
mr.
chief
justice
to
be
talking
about
in
any
given
situation
exclusive
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well,
i
would
say
that
once
the
case
is
in
the
bankruptcy
court
either
by
a
chapter
proceedings
or
by
an
adjudication,
then
the
entire
bankruptcy
act
prevails
and
then
the
systems
of
priorities
are
set
forth
by
section
64.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
if
this
law
were
rescinded
or
if
it
were
repealed,
or
if
the
courts
were
to
strike
it
down
and
there
were
no
bankruptcy
then
i
think
there'll
be
no
question
as
to
where
it
would
go.
the
equitable
title
would
be
in
the
employees.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
think
by
the
nature
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
i
believe
that
the
trust
company
is
specifically
excluded
by
the
act.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
all
hypothetical,
assuming
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that
it
went,
so
i
understand
you
fully
that
it
--
the
trust
company
became
insolvent
or
bankrupt.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
at
all
that
the
bankruptcy
act
would
prevail
assuming
that
it
did
go
and
come
in
the
bankruptcy
act
either
voluntarily
or
involuntarily.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
in
so
far
as
i
understand
trust
companies,
they
hold
some
of
them
in
trust
pools
where
they
commingle
funds.
(voice
overlap)
i
think
they
get
a
different
problem
there.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
or
the
individual.
well
then
again,
i
think
you
have
an
entirely
different
situation
here.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes.
the
government
seems
to
be
relying
rather
heavily
upon
the
trust
fund
theory
and
the
theory
of
trust
and
trust
ex
mal
officio
and
question
why
the
seventh
circuit
court
did
not
address
itself
to
this.
and
i
think
it's
very
obvious
that
the
reason
why
the
seventh
circuit
court
did
not
address
itself
to
this
particular
argument
of
the
government,
is
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
it
to
do
so
because
the
court
there
interpreted
section
64
(a)
to
the
same
as
the
connecticut
general
case
did
and
the
same
as
the
green
case
is
that
number
one,
they
were
not
in
conflict
with
one
another
that
section
7501
(a)
and
64
(a)
(1)
could
be
read
separately
and
by
the
second
sentence
in
7501
(a),
it
provided
that
the
trust
have
the
same
limitations
on
it
as
the
taxes
from
which
the
fund
arose
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
taxes
arose
from
and
by
virtue
with
the
bankruptcy
act
and
therefore
the
bankruptcy
act
would
prevail
and
there
goes
section
64
(a).
but
further,
if
these
were
not
the
case,
that
the
strong
policy
of
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
would
prevail
over
the
general
provisions
and
the
general
policy
of
section
7501.
i
would
like
to
review
rather
briefly
the
history
of
these
cases
starting
out
with
the
guaranty
title
company
case,
an
opinion
in
1912
where
the
section
3466
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provided
for
a
priority
as
opposed
to
7501
which
provides
for
trust
fund.
there
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
a
beneficent
policy
that
64
(a)
should
prevail
especially
in
that
case
that
pertain
to
wage
earners.
this
was
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
davis
versus
pringle
in
1925.
now,
this
line
of
cases
goes
undisturbed
up
until
the
time
of
u.s.
versus
nicholas
or
nicholas
versus
u.s.
which
was
decided
in
this
court
in
1964.
the
problem
arises
with
the
line
of
cases
under
the
city
of
new
york
versus
rassner
and
then
the
rassner
case.
the
first
case
in
1942
in
which
this
trust
fund
was
found
to
apply.
the
rassner
case
provided
or
the
rassner
case
said
that
it
was
a
general
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
section
64
(a)
as
opposed
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
trust.
and
the
rassner
case
went
on
to
say
that
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
policy
or
if
the
provisions
of
64
(a)
were
other
than
general
then
the
result
would
be
different.
and
this
court
has
shown
in
nicholas
versus
united
states
in
express
language
said
that
it
is
a
strong
policy
that
prevails
in
64
(a).
that
being
the
case
than
the
perhaps
fall
from
underneath
the
rassner
case
and
all
of
the
cases
that
follow
it
fall
like
dominoes.
this
is
the
theory
of
the
trustee.
this
has
been
the
position
of
the
trustee
from
its
very
--
the
very
inception
of
this
case.
in
the
nicholas
case,
the
court
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
taxes
that
were
incurred
during
the
chapter
xi,
and
this
is
precisely
what
we're
talking
about
here,
come
within
the
first
priorities
of
section
64,
the
bankruptcy
act.
that
is
the
cost
of
administration.
the
history
of
the
administrative
and
cost
of
administration
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
have
constantly
worked
towards
allowance
across
of
administration
and
the
way
from
tax
collecting.
when
you
trace
the
history
in
the
bankruptcy
act
is
enacted
in
1800
and
1841,
1867
and
1898.
all
gave
top
priority
to
taxes.
it
wasn't
until
1926
that
the
priorities
were
changed,
the
cost
of
administration
was
advanced
and
that
the
taxes
were
reduced
to
a
sixth
priority.
then
under
the
chandler
act
of
1938,
the
system
of
priorities
was
retained
and
further
the
tax
collector
was
further
restricted
but
being
required
to
file
this
claim
within
the
limitation
set
on
all
other
claimants.
and
again
in
1952,
the
act
was
again
amended
to
give
further
priority
to
cost
of
administration
by
providing
that
cost
of
administration
in
a
superseding
bankruptcy
takes
priority
over
the
cost
of
administration
in
the
superseded
chapter
proceedings,
further
strengthening
the
position
of
cost
of
administration.
and
lastly
in
1966,
the
most
recent
amendment
which
changed
the
priorities
further
or
limited
further
the
claim
for
taxes
by
holding
that
the
taxes
could
only
be
claimed
for
a
three-year
period
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy.
so
we
see
historically,
this
picture
of
the
reducing
of
the
tax
claim
in
advancing
the
cost
of
administration.
and
i
think
as
the
court
below
in
the
very
scholarly
opinion
by
mr.
justice
hastings
points
out
and
refers
to
the
congressional
or
rather
the
senate
reports
and
the
house
conference
reports
as
it
apply
to
the
cost
of
administration.
and
the
need
to
preserve
this
cost
of
administration
because
let's
take
just
what
could
happen
very
easily
in
this
case.
we
are
only
--
the
government
is
only
seeking
to
impress
the
trust
on
those
taxes
that
were
collected
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
but
if
you
were
to
read
section
7501
that
says
any
person
who
collects
taxes
that
would
also
mean
the
bankrupt
prior
to
filing.
further
and
following
the
rassner
line
of
cases,
if
you
have
every
state
and
every
municipality
enacting
trust
fund
legislation,
there's
nothing
left
to
administer
in
these
cases
or
were
still,
you
have
a
trustee
who
is
going
to
wait
and
to
see
if
anyone
is
going
to
assert
his
trust
rights
and
the
estate
is
going
to
go
unadministered
during
this
period
of
time.
and
as
the
house
reports
and
the
house
conference
report
and
the
senate
report,
i
believe
it
was
in
the
82nd
congress
emphasized
the
necessity
to
protect
the
trustee
in
order
to
have
orderly
administration
of
the
estate.
if
you
don't
protect
the
trustee,
if
you
don't
give
him
the
first
priority,
then
you
are
not
going
to
have
orderly
administration
of
estate
just
the
normal
routine
that's
employed
by
the
trustee.
first
of
all,
he
ceases
the
property
in
order
to
protect
it
and
so
doing
here
immediately
in
first
liabilities.
he's
got
to
post
the
bond
as
required
by
court.
he's
got
to
assume
rent
liabilities
for
use
in
occupancy.
he's
got
to
employ
inventory
clerks.
he
has
got
to
employ
appraiser
by
rule
of
court.
these
are
all
obligations
that
he
himself
must
pay.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
if
the
lien
has
been
perfected
the
same
as
any
lien
under
the
uniform
commercial
code.
if
it
has
been
perfected,
it
is
a
valid
and
subsisting
lien.
and
that
property
is
excluded
from
the
bankrupt
estate.
but
that's
by
separate
statute
though,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
usually
does
has
some
accommodation,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no
sir,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
mr.
justice
white.
the
usually
an
accommodation
is
worked
up.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
but
if
the
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well
i
--
you're
speaking
now
of
the
second
sentence
of
7501
(a).
well,
i
feel
that
after
the
interpretation
put
on
that
language
in
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case
and
the
green
case
and
also
in
this
case
in
the
court
below
is
that
the
trust
has
a
limitations
placed
upon
it
by
that
as
a
taxes
from
which
the
fund
arose
and
that
is
the
bankruptcy
act
and
therefore
the
bankruptcy
act
would
apply.
now,
i
think
in
the
hypothesis
that
you
gave
me
is
it
pertains
to
something
entirely
different
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
because
it
is
again
a
separate
statutory
procedure.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
there
is
none
sir.
they
did
not
protect
or
perfect
the
lien.
well,
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
white,
if
that
were
the
case,
the
trustee
wouldn't
take
possession
of
the
property
and
there
be
no
estate
to
administer.
he
would
file
a
“no
assets”
report
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
if
that's
all
the
assets
there
were,
certainly.
and
that
happens
in
any
number
of
cases
not
only
in
tax
liens,
but
on
uniform
commercial
code
liens.
this
is
very
common
place.
(voice
overlap)
but
there
you
have
it,
you
have
it
set
forth
with
clarity
in
the
law
and
if
they
have
protected
their
position,
then
there
is
nothing
to
administer
for
the
title
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
he
would
treat
that,
sir.
i
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
because
if
i
understand
you
mr.
justice
white,
you're
talking
about
funds
that
have
been
segregated.
that
there
any
withholding
tax
account
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
i
would
not
because
the
government
has
not
perfected
its
lien
rights
in
that
instance.
and
it
becomes
the
general
funds
of
the
estate.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
then
if
you
get
back
again
to
7401
and
64
(a),
where
does
the
priorities
lie?
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well,
i
think
you
have
a
different
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
exactly
what
we
did
sir
in
this
case.
what
we
did
--
let
me
change
that.
that's
exactly
the
way
the
trustee
treated
funds
that
were
on
deposit
in
the
bank
account
that
was
created
and
set
up
in
this
case
for
deposit
of
tax
moneys.
there
was
an
account
that
was
set
up
here.
and
i
refer
you
to
abstract
39
which
show
in
the
petition
that
when
the
president
of
the
corporation
was
questioned
about
the
assets,
he
said
that
a
bank
account
had
been
set
up
and
this
was
--
this
was
set
forth
in
the
petition
paragraph
1
in
abstract
44.
paragraph
1
of
the
referee's
orders
makes
an
order
with
reference
to
that
bank
account.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
precisely
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i'm
afraid
i
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
they
were
filed
during
the
chapter
xi
proceedings
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
he
deposited
them
in
a
special
account
in
the
state
bank
of
elk
grove
village
in
elk
grove,
illinois.
those
moneys
may
still
be
there
for
all
i
know.
we
exercise
no
jurisdiction
over
them.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
we're
talking
about
separate
funds
that
were
--
when
the
debtor
went
into
possession,
an
order
was
entered
ordering
him
to
open
up
three
accounts.
he
did
open
up
an
account
in
the
elk
grove
bank
for
the
purpose
of
withholding
taxes
and
fica
he
did
make
some
deposits
in
there.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
he
made
some
deposits.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
but
not
enough.
that's
right.
we
haven't
touched
these
funds.
we
had
--
we
don't
claim
that.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
make
no
claim.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
right.
and
they
want
to
impress
the
trust
on
property,
on
capital
assets
of
the
corporation
that
existed
long
before
the
chapter
xi
proceedings
and
in
no
way
traceable
and
there's
no
question
of
commingling.
there
is
no
question
of
trust
ex
mal
officio
as
it
provide
--
as
it
pertains
to
the
capital
funds.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
roughly
maybe
$200
to
$300.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
oh!
excuse
me,
the
total
amount
that
was
withheld
i'm
sorry
was
$10,075.52,
the
amount
that
was
deposited
that
was
maybe
$200
to
$300.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
no,
the
government
wants
the
entire
sum.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
actually
that
would
be
it
and
would
be
whatever
is
in
that
account.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
i
would
say
the
wage
earners
at
least
to
the
extent
that
credit
is
given
to
them
for
the
moneys
that
should
have
been
deposited.
i
can't
see
in
no
way
at
all
that
the
estate
has
been
enhanced.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
you
mean
as
subrogees,
i
don't
know
any
statutory
provision.
i
know
of
no
case
law.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
well
except
that
that
is
--
i
would
say
under
ordinary
circumstances,
i
would
have
to
buy
your
argument.
however,
i
feel
that
what
we're
here
before
this
court
to
interpret
is
the
effect
of
7501
and
that's
in
the
relationship
with
64
(a)
(1).
and
i'm
just
asking
the
court
to
follow
the
precedent
that's
here
before
have
been
sent
is
that
it
is
a
strong
policy
of
64
(a)
that
must
prevail
over
7501
if
there
is
a
conflict.
in
other
words,
this
7501
(a)
applies
up
until
the
moment
that
the
bankrupt
--
any
proceeding
on
bankruptcy
is
filed.
then
the
bankruptcy
act
takes
over
completely.
i
don't
think
you
can
have
the
bankruptcy
applied
just
piecemeal
and
have
collateral
legislation
that
is
going
to
interfere
with
the
administration
of
the
estates
which
is
what
7501
does
because
you're
in
real
serious
problems
when
it
comes
to
the
administration
of
estates.
if
you're
going
to
ask
a
trustee
whose
worth
is
sought
to
come
in
and
to
expend
money,
his
own
money
and
incur
personal
liabilities
and
not
know
whether
or
not
there
is
a
trust
that
is
going
to
be
exerted
by
the
united
states
government
and
i
suggest
later
on
if
the
court
is
to
reverse
the
courts
below.
all
the
municipalities
that
would
pass
that
legislation
and
all
the
states
that
would
pass
that
legislation
you
would
have
no
orderly
administration
of
the
estate
until
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
untangle
it.
now,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
irreparable
damage
done
to
the
system
during
that
hiatus.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir?
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
oh!
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
they
are
claiming
over
and
above
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
they
enjoy
a
fourth
priority
under
section
64
(a)
(1).
excuse
me,
no.
i'm
sorry.
they
enjoy
a
first
priority.
they
enjoy
--
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
administrative
expense
after
--
the
administrative
expense
of
the
proceeding
bankrupt.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
that
would
the
cost
of
administration.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
that's
right.
they
do
enjoy
that
first
priority
with
the
subject
to
the
one
condition
that
i
stated.
mr.
kevin
j.
gillogly
yes
sir,
but
i
think
the
principle
is
much
larger
than
that
what
could
be
done
to
the
entire
system.
