does
the

justice

white
the
government
doesn't
have
the
same
lien
for
these
withheld
taxes
as
it
would
for
the
income
taxes
of
the
employer
himself
owed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
government
has
a
protected
lien
for
income
taxes
and
the
employer
goes
bankrupt.
what's
the
relative
position
of
the
government
vis-à-vis
of
taxes
and
where
it's
got
a
lien
for
income
taxes,
how
do
they
stand
as
against
administrative
expenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
ordinary
taxes
the
government
--
that
a
bankrupt
owes
a
government
--
a
bankrupt
company
owes
a
government.
let's
assume
the
government
has
perfected
a
lien
on
the
prior
to
bankruptcy
on
the
assets
of
the
individual
or
the
company.
what
is
the
status
of
that
lien
in
bankruptcy
with
respect
to
administration
expense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
is
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
this.
it's
excluded
in
the
bankrupt
estate
and
yet
the
trustee
takes
position
of
it
at
the
outset.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
know,
it
it's
still
--
it's
still
the
bankrupt's
property
just
subject
to
the
lien
that's
all
it
is.
it's
just
a
protective
lien.
the
government
has
to
take
possession
of
it.
now
the
trustee
takes
position
of
the
properties
as
the
bankrupt's
property
just
subject
to
the
lien.
now,
does
the
lien
holder
have
to
share
administrative
expenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
even
if
there
is
any
other
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
the
question
that
i
asked
mr.
stone.
is
this
--
under
7501,
it
says
that
these
amounts
owing
the
withholding
taxes
shall
be
assessed,
collected,
and
paid
in
the
same
manner
and
such
the
same
provisions
limitations,
as
other
as
applicable
with
respect
to
taxes
from
which
said
fund
arose?
now,
does
that
mean
that
the
government
did
not
want
to
lien
if
it
wants
some
priority
over
other
creditors
if
it
wants
the
position
of
the
lien
holder,
must
it
perfect
its
lien
and
what
else
could
that
language
mean?
i
mean
it
may
be
a
trust
fund
but
it
says
it's
collectible
in
the
same
manner
as
other
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
why
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
the
government
didn't
take
the
position.
it
didn't
take
the
normal
steps
to
perfect
its
tax
claim
here
in
order
to
give
it
priority
over
administration
expenses.
there's
no
claim
that
the
government
has
perfected
any
lien
in
these
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
all
the
assets.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
if
a
trustee
is
appointed
before
a
company
that
has
been
adjudicated
and
he
finds
that
the
only
sizeable
assets
the
company
has,
is
made
up
of
withholding
taxes
and
haven't
been
paid
over
to
the
government.
he
won't
treat
that
as
a
no
asset
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
just
say.
i'll
just
say
that
you
find
some
bank
accounts
and
you
find
that
the
total
amount
owed
for
withholding
taxes
exceed
the
money
in
the
bank.
there
hasn't
been
any
segregation
or
anything.
the
only
assets
are
bank
accounts
but
the
obligation
here
withholding
taxes
exceeds
the
amount
in
the
bank.
now,
would
you
make
that
a
no
asset
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.

he
found
$700
that
he
didn't
deposit,
is
that
what
we're
trying
to
--
justice
byron

white
what
do
you
say
about
subject
liable
in
so
far
as
it
says
that

the

will
be
collected
by
the
