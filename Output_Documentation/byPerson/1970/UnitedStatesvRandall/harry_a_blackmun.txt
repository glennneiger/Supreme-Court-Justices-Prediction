justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stone,
on
your
theory
the
bankrupt
estate
is
really
enjoying
the
windfall
if
it
prevails
here
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
trust
fund
you're
talking
about
is
in
every
case
of
this
kind
is
a
fund
that
arises
from
the
bankrupt's
asset
themselves,
from
the
bankrupt's
own
assets.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
just
something
that
he
paid
wages
but
he
wrote
checks
to
his
employees
for
an
amount
left
than
they're
--
what
they
were
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
paid
and
so
he
just
kept
the
rest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
so
there's
never
been
a
transfer
creation
of
the
trust
fund?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
never
did.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stone,
we're
really
in
a
situation
here
of
tension
between
the
two
statutes,
aren't
we?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
has
to
be
your
position.
i
think
you
have
no
alternative.
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
however
is
there
anything
in
the
chronology
of
the
two
statutes
which
is
that
is
of
help
here,
which
is
the
older
of
the
two?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
other
one
which
is
i
recall
came
in
about
1934
is
the
newer
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
this
lend
you
any
support
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
what
prompted
at
its
birth
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
am
i
correct
that
this
statute
come
in
to
being
before
withholding
was
established?
