justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
mr.
stone,
i
gather
the
employees
get
credit
for
the
amount--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
books
indicated
as
withheld
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
payment
over
by
the
employer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
point
is
that
nothing
in
the
way
of
the
trust
involved
here
for
the
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
for
uncle
sam.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
stone,
i
gather
that
generally,
employer
not
a
bankrupt,
an
employer
doesn't
have
to
or
does
he
keep
withheld
taxes
in
the
separate
fund?
he
may
use
them,
can
he
in
the
business
ordinarily?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
absconds
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
prosecuted
as
embezzlement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
really?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
he
prosecuted
as
an
embezzlement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
they
prosecute
him
that
under?
this
must
happen
doesn't
it
that
an
employer
absconds
with
the
money?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
if
they're
not
and
it
has
to
be
a
prosecution
because
he
absconds
with
it.
under
what
do
you
prosecute?
some
special
provision
of
the
income
tax
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
it
would
have
to
be
as
an
embezzlement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let
me
–
you
said
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
where
the
government
has
perfected
the
lien
you
say
that's
treated
exactly
as
you
would
on
the
other
lien
case
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
it
has
not
perfected
the
lien,
take
mr.
justice
white's
hypothetical
except
that
money
in
the
bank
is
earmarked
on
the
account
title
as
withholding
taxes
belonging
to
united
states,
what
then
is
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
with
this
--
would
you
say
that
is
a
no
asset
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
i
gather
are
with
taxes
withheld
after
the
petition
had
replied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
the
taxes
withheld
have
not
been
deposited
in
any
bank
account
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
had
not
been
segregated.
they
have
not
been
segregated
in
an
account
as
had
the
--
with
the
taxes
withheld
before
in
filing
of
the
petition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
did
they
do
with
money
when
he
withheld
it?
what
did
he
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
are
talking
about
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
make
some.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
enough.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
to
the
extent
that
they
created
a
separate
fund
you
make
no
claim
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
but
the
government
makes
a
claim
with
respect
to
the
total
he
should
have
deposited.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
doesn't
need
it,
has
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
you
can
say
that
he
doesn't
need
it
because
of
his
estate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
this
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
mr.
