mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
raises
a
fundamental
question
as
to
the
legal
status
of
taxes
which
an
employer
withholds
from
the
wages
of
his
employees
and
specifically
the
case
raises
the
proper
treatment
of
those
withheld
funds
in
the
event
that
the
employer
becomes
bankrupt
or
in
is
to
a
bankruptcy
procedure.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
relatively
simple.
halo
metal
products,
inc.
filed
a
petition
for
an
arrangement
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
that
is
the
provision
which
allows
operation
of
the
business
to
try
to
stow
up
the
bankruptcy.
it
was
allowed
by
the
referee
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
remain
in
possession
of
the
business
and
to
carry
on
the
business'
operation
subject
to
the
referee
supervision
during
the
chapter
xi
arrangement.
as
is
the
custom
in
such
an
arrangement,
the
referee
entered
in
elaborate
order
requiring
the
debtor
in
possession
to
file
periodic
reports
and
to
maintain
full
records
of
its
operations
during
the
arrangement
period.
and
in
addition,
the
referee
ordered
the
debtor
to
open
up
three
bank
accounts.
first
of
these
accounts
was
to
receive
all
revenues,
received
by
the
business
during
the
operation
in
the
arrangement
period.
and
the
second
account
was
to
receive
periodically
from
the
funds
deposited
in
the
first
revenues
account
the
amount
necessary
to
pay
all
employee
wages
and
disbursements
from
this
payroll
account
were
to
be
made
at
proper
intervals
with
the
approval
of
the
referee.
the
referee
ordered
that
simultaneously
with
meeting
the
debtor
in
possession's
payroll
obligations
that
the
debtor
deposit
into
a
third
special
account
the
amount
of
tax
and
social
security
deductions
that
the
debtor
was
required
to
withhold
from
his
employee's
wages
and
withdrawals
from
this
third
account
were
to
be
allowed
only
for
payment
of
withheld
taxes
and
welfare
benefits
as
those
payments
became
due
to
united
states
government.
the
debtor
failed
almost
entirely
to
comply
with
the
referee's
orders
with
the
orders
of
the
bankruptcy
court
with
respect
to
this
withheld
taxes.
although
the
income
in
social
security
taxes
were
withheld
from
the
employee
wages,
the
withheld
funds
were
not
placed
in
the
special
account
nor
would
they
pay
over
the
united
states
at
the
proper
time
as
required
by
the
arrangement
court.
during
the
arrangement,
the
united
stats
filed
the
proof
of
claim
for
payment
of
a
thousand
and
seventy-five
dollars
that
is
$1,075
of
fica
in
income
taxes
withheld
from
employees
salaries
on
the
ground
that
this
amount
was
a
special
trust
for
the
united
states
benefit
under
section
7501
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
and
about
the
section,
i
shall
elaborate
shortly.
subsequently,
about
three
months
after
the
filing
of
the
original
arrangement
petition,
halo
was
adjudicated
a
bankrupt.
in
a
month
later
on
december
22,
1967,
the
united
states
filed
the
petition
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
asking
that
the
withheld
taxes
at
which
it
claim
as
the
trust
fund
under
section
7501
be
paid
over
to
the
united
states
just
as
any
trust
fund
would
be
paid
over
prior
to
payment
of
the
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
the
referee
denied
the
government's
petition,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
referee's
denial
of
the
petition
and
it
is
that
which
we
are
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
contest
now.
both
of
these
courts
held
essentially
that
halo's
obligation
to
pay
over
to
the
government
the
taxes
withheld
from
employee
wages
was
merely
an
administrative
expense
of
the
bankrupt
estate
and
was
thereby
subject
to
the
scale
of
priorities
established
by
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
with
which
i
am
sure
this
court
is
quite
familiar.
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
view
the
issue
presented
here
which
is
whether
the
government
is
entitled
to
recognition
of
a
trust
fund
for
the
amount
of
taxes
withheld
from
the
salaries
of
the
bankrupt's
employees
during
the
arrangement
period.
as
breaking
down
essentially
into
two
parts,
two
questions.
the
first
question
is
and
this
is
as
really
the
question
is
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
whether
the
trust
fund
concept
is
simply
inapplicable
altogether
as
both
courts
below
seemed
to
have
felt
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
and
the
second
question
which
neither
court
reached
but
which
i
believe
was
the
focus
of
the
bankruptcy
referee's
decision
is
whether
assuming
that
the
trust
does
not
disappear
merely
by
virtue
of
the
withholding
employer's
bankruptcy.
whether
the
trust
is
nonetheless
defeated
or
enjoinment
of
the
trust
is
defeated
by
virtue
of
the
government's
inability
to
trace
the
race
of
the
trust
and
i
will
address
myself
to
both
of
these
questions.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
exactly
right
and
prior
to
several
years
ago,
i
believe
in
1965
when
the
third
circuit
decided
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case,
every
court
that
had
looked
into
this
and
all
the
commentators
as
i
shall
shortly
view
the
question
as
not
one
of
priorities
but
simply
the
recognition
of
a
trust
and
not
a
matter
of
relative
priorities.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
is
it
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
exactly,
exactly
that
is
precisely
what
i
think
is
important
to
show
and
what
we
are
really
alarmed
about
in
this
decision
is
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
these
trust
assets
as
debts
and
viewed
this
case
as
a
matter
of
priorities
between
conflicting
administrative
expenses.
now,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
blackmun
though
it
is
hard
to
trace
as
i
intend
to
discuss
at
length
that
is
hard
to
trace
precisely
what
happen
to
the
funds
one
likely
illogical
assumption
is
that
this
trust
fund
has
simply
been
added
to
the
amount
of
assets
available
to
the
collection
of
the
bankrupt's
creditors
and
therefore
collection
from
those
assets
would
be
windfall
to
those
creditors.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
and
so
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
though
it
was
ordered
by
the
referee
and
it
was
ordered
by
the
referee
that
the
trustee
make
a
transfer
at
the
time
he
paid
the
wages.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
in
fact,
he
never
did.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
one
of
the
points
which
i
plan
to
address
myself
to
is
whether
the
enjoyment
of
the
trust
ought
to
be
defeated
by
the
fact
that
the
trustee
never
did
make
these
deposits
and
so
that
all
that
we're
really
talking
about
is
whether
a
trust
ought
to
be
imposed
on
general
assets
of
the
bankrupt
estate.
that
is
the
question
in
this
case
as
we
view
it.
but
that
is
not
the
question
as
court
of
appeals
viewed
it
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
see
exactly
how
the
court
of
appeals
did
identify
this
question
and
to
make
sure
that
what
i
consider
the
gross
misconception
on
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
be
corrected.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
exactly
right.
it's
exactly
right
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
our
theory.
and
that
is
the
theory
of
professor
scott
and
that
is
the
theory
of
all
the
courts
which
have
directed
themselves
to
this
aspect
of
the
case
and
the
theory
which
these
courts
have
gone
on
and
ever
since
we've
gotten
into
this,
i
might
as
well
anticipate
what
i
expected
to
be
a
later
stage
of
the
argument.
the
theory
that
these
courts
have
gone
upon
is
that
yes,
in
a
situation
where
the
raise
of
a
trust
cannot
be
traced
where
you
are
simply
talking
about
general
assets,
it
is
you
run
a
risks
in
either
imposing
the
trust
or
disregarding
the
trust
you
run
a
risks
that
loss
in
the
--
that
the
actual
proceeds
have
been
lost
in
the
accounting
procedure,
there
is
no
record
to
say
where
the
assets
went
and
so
that
either
the
trustee,
either
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust
or
the
general
creditors
may
have
suffered
in
some
way.
now,
this
seems
to
me
the
most
likely
assumption
is
that
the
estate
has
been
fattened
by
the
failure
to
pay
over
these
funds
at
the
designated
time.
and
though
we
want
to
protect
the
creditors
with
respect
to
the
general
assets,
the
estate
has
been
the
view
of
all
the
courts
that
have
considered
this.
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
referee,
the
debtor
in
possession
is
himself
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court
and
because
the
debtor
in
possession
is
the
person
who
buy
his
negligence
failed
to
segregate
these
funds
and
failed
to
setup
the
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
that
we
ought
not
to
make
the
beneficiary
of
a
trust
suffer
because
of
the
negligence
of
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
we
ought
to
give
that
a
beneficiary
the
right
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court
is
going
to
do
what
the
bankruptcy
court
tells
him
to
particularly
when
the
bankruptcy
court
states
in
the
order
that
it
shall
supervise
all
these
operations
on
a
weekly
or
monthly
basis.
so
that
all
have
--
all
who
have
considered
this
question
have
felt
that
the
equitable
considerations
which
militate
in
favor
of
recognizing
this
right
to
rely
on
the
bankruptcy
court
doing
what
it
says
its
going
to
do
should
eliminate
the
requirement
of
tracing
the
raise
of
the
trust.
but
i
want
also
to
make
clear
is
that
this
is
not
the
ground.
this
issue
which
i
consider
to
be
the
crucial
issue
of
the
case
is
not
the
issue
that
the
courts
below
went
upon.
the
courts
below
in
my
opinion
fundamentally
misconstrued
the
whole
nature
of
withheld
taxes
and
the
interrelation
of
the
bankruptcy
act
with
this
trust
fund.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
a
very
different
case
from
the
one
we're
facing
mr.
chief
justice,
for
it.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
--
and
i
think
that
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is
perhaps
not
but
i
don't
think
that
controls
the
instant
case
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
if
you
can
identify
the
raise
of
this
trust
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
if
you
can
identify
the
raise
of
this
trust,
i
at
the
moment
find
no
argument
against
the
proposition
that
the
general
assets
of
the
creditors
of
this
company
ought
then
to
be
subject
of
the
government's
tax
claim.
i
would
not
want
to
go
on
record
is
committing
the
government
to
that
position.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
can
trace
the
raise
of
the
trust
then
the
government
ought
to
be
required
to
go
after
trace
of
a
raise
and
the
person
has
clearly
responsible
for
the
ways
of
the
raise
of
that
trust.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
their
liability
with
respect
to
those
withheld
funds
is
discharge
that
the
time
wages
are
paid
and
taxes
withheld
from
those
wages
which
we
think
identifies
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
there
and
similarly
if
any
refund
is
owed.
if
the
employer
although
withholds
it
is
the
employee
who
has
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
it's
a
trust
for
the
government.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
only
for
the
government.
now,
that
trust
is
set
forth
in
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
quoted
on
page
26
of
our
brief
to
which
i
refer
the
court
and
that
provision
states
as
follows.
“whenever
any
person
is
required
to
collect
or
withhold
any
internal
revenue
tax
from
any
other
person
and
to
pay
over
such
tax
of
the
united
states,
the
amount
of
tax
so
collected
or
withheld
shall
be
held
to
be
a
special
fund
in
trust
for
the
united
states.”
now,
i
take
it
that
neither
respondent
nor
the
courts
below
would
dispute
it
by
virtue
of
section
7501
an
employer
who
withholds
income
and
social
security
taxes
from
his
employee's
salaries
is
the
trustee
of
a
trust
at
least
up
until
the
point
that
the
employer
becomes
insolvent.
now,
let
us
consider
the
case
of
the
employees
--
of
the
employer's
insolvency
and
look
briefly
at
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
is
set
forth
in
relevant
part
of
page
23
of
our
brief.
that
section
entitled
“debts
which
have
priority”
establishes
those
debts
of
the
bankrupt
which
have
priority
over
general
unsecured
creditors
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
that
section
reads
as
follows,
“the
debts
to
have
priority,
in
advance
of
the
payment
of
dividends
to
creditors,
and
to
be
paid
in
full
out
of
bankrupt
estates,
and
the
order
of
payment,
shall
be
(1)
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration
including
the
actual
and
necessary
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
filing
the
petition.”
and
then
follows
a
general
enumeration
of
expenses
considered
to
be
administrative
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate
followed
by
four
other
categories
of
debts
which
have
priority.
and
i
note
in
that
regard
just
for
the
sake
of
clarity
that
the
fourth
category
of
debts
with
priority
includes
“taxes
which
became
legally
due
knowing
by
the
bankrupt
to
the
united
states
or
to
any
state
or
any
subdivision
thereof”
and
this
priority
for
tax
debts
includes
essentially
tax
debts
which
are
incurred
by
the
employer
prior
to
the
institution
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
it
is
not
disputed
that
tax
debts
incurred
by
the
bankrupt
during
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
are
administrative
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate
in
sharing
the
first
priority
but
that
would
not
in
our
view
include
these
taxes
for
the
reason
i
am
about
to
state.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
my
precise
point
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
we
are
not
in
the
state
of
tension
between
these
two
statutes
for
the
reason
that
though
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
felt
we
were
for
the
reason
that
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
trust
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
deals
with
administrative
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate
and
unless
you
can
at
some
point
identify
withheld
taxes
as
tax
debts
of
the
employers,
there
is
no
tension
because
section
64
has
no
bearing
on
those
amount.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
section
64,
the
bankruptcy
act
is
the
older
of
the
two.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
lends
--
i
think
it
does
lend
us
some
support.
of
course,
there
have
been
--
it
lends
us
some
support
but
the
trust
was
still
congressionally
enacted
even
though
section
64
is
already
on
the
book
and
the
trust
is
not,
the
trust
provision
section
7501
does
not
refer
in
any
way
to
a
limitation
arising
from
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
institution
of
the
trust
fund?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
provision?
yes,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
there
is
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report
of
both
are
unlimited
in
terms
of
explaining
the
purpose
but
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
the
trust
impose
in
section
7501
was
designed
to
forestall
the
possibility
that
courts
would
limit
the
government
to
mere
debt
collection
procedures
and
would
not
allow
either
trust
collection
or
tax
collection
extraordinary
procedures
against
those
withheld
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
withholding
of
income
tax
was
after.
yes,
it
came
between
before
the
withholding
of
income
tax
and
before
the
withholding
of
fica
but
there
was
already
on
the
board's
withholding
a
various
excise
taxes
and
it
was
this
particular
taxes
which
the
original
predecessor
section
7501
was
designed
to
take
care
of.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
is
imperative
to
the
structure
of
the
social
security
act
and
to
the
withholding
of
income
taxes.
yes
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
view
is
that
the
entire
legislative
scheme
which
we
discuss
at
length
at
pages
7
to
10
of
our
brief,
the
entire
legislative
scheme
behind
withholding
of
all
taxes
shows
that
the
government
serves
merely
as
a
collection
agent
with
respect
to
these
taxes
that
these
are
tax
debts
of
the
employee
to
the
government
and
not
of
the
employer
to
the
government.
and
therefore,
that
these
are
neither
taxes
nor
debts
of
the
bankrupt
to
the
government
and
therefore
don't
come
under
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
establish
priorities
for
the
debts
and
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate.
essentially,
if
employees
paid
$100
in
wages,
he
receives
$85
and
he
is
considered
to
have
discharged
the
$15
a
tax
liability,
and
the
employer
at
that
point
merely
holds
as
the
tenth
circuit
recently
said
holds
as
a
collection
agent
for
the
government.
he
holds
it
for
a
brief
period
of
time
and
is
required
to
pay
it
over
and
it's
my
submission
to
this
court
that
regardless
of
how
strong
a
policy
section
64,
the
bankruptcy
act
embodies
this
to
the
equal
priority
of
administrative
expenses
does
nothing
in
that
provision
which
converts
trust
funds
into
administrative
expenses
or
which
deals
in
any
way
with
the
bankrupt's
obligation
to
handle
the
funds
which
it
is
receive
in
the
capacity
of
collection
agent
and
neither
of
the
court's
below
nor
the
respondent
trustee
has
attempted
to
answer
this
what
i
considered
to
be
a
crucial
threshold
question
of
what
interplay
it
all
to
section
64
have
on
this
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
think
that
it
certainly
needs
to
be
discussed.
of
course,
this
court
reserved
in
nicholas
the
question
before
us
here.
nicholas
involved
the
question
where
the
interest
on
withheld
taxes
accrues
past
the
period
of
bankruptcy
or
whether
it
stops
with
the
institution
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
or
the
actual
institution
of
bankruptcy.
and
the
court
in
nicholas
held
that
interest
did
not
accrue,
it
held
on
the
broad
general
principle
that
interests
during
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
ought
not
to
accrue
it
all
because
it
eats
away
it
creditors,
assets,
and
creditors
ought
not
be
disadvantaged
merely
because
of
delays
attributable
to
the
long
length
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
a
lien?
not
a
special
lien
mr.
justice
white,
it
does
not
file
a
special
[voice
overlap]
trust
rather
than
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
a
question
that
hasn't
been
tested.
it
hasn't
--
it
can
go
in
i
suppose,
this
hasn't
been
tested
but
i
suppose
it
go
in
under
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
white
except
that
i
believe
that
if
the
lien
is
perfected
that
they
stand
ahead
of
all
and
secured
obligations
including
administrative
expenses
but
i'm
not
sure
about
the
answer
to
that.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
court
in
the
nicholas
case
cited
the
sentence
of
section
7501
and
i
think
it
is
important
since
no
doubt
the
nicholas
case
will
--
does
have
to
be
examined
to
determine
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
second
sentence
of
section
7501
after
the
trust
is
declared
says
as
follows,
the
withheld
taxes
shall
be
“assessed,
collected,
and
paid”
in
the
same
manner
and
subject
to
the
same
provisions
and
limitation
including
penalties
as
are
applicable
with
respect
to
the
taxes
from
such
fund
arose.
now
we
think
that
as
we've
discussed
in
our
brief
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
makes
it
clear
that
it
was
not
designed
really
though
it
says
limitations,
it
was
not
designed
to
limit
remedies
but
to
expand
government
revenues
but
even
the
quoted
language
taken
at
its
face
value
is
i
think
of
anything
favorable
to
our
position
in
this
case
because
the
phrase
“taxes
from
which
such
fund
arose”
clearly
refers
to
the
income
and
social
security
taxes
owed
by
the
employees
and
withheld
by
the
employer.
and
these
taxes
on
the
employees
would
not
subject
to
any
collection
limitation
by
virtue
of
the
employer's
bankruptcy.
now
they
would
be
subject
in
any
bankruptcy
proceeding
to
a
limitation
on
the
accrual
of
interests
during
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
but
they
would
not
be
subject
to
a
limitation
by
virtue
of
the
employer's
bankruptcy
and
there
and
i
think
lies
the
essential
distinction
even
given
the
fact
that
the
court
relied
on
the
second
sentence
of
section
7501
in
the
nicholas
case.
that
is
the
essential
distinction
between
nicholas
and
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
also
an
(inaudible),
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
has
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
could
be.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
could
be.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
would
think
he
could
be.
it
is
embezzlement
because
he
is
required
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
have
raised
that.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
will
have
to
say
that
the
government
has
not
attested
at
all
the
whole
range
of
permissible
activity
that
an
employer
can
conduct
with
respect
to
these
withheld
funds.
they
are
due
so
quickly.
in
the
ordinary
case,
they're
paid
over
so
quickly
because
they
are
due
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know
of
any
special
provision
that
would
cover
that.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
would
think
that
the
embezzling
remedy
would
be
available
but
i
suppose
the
willful,
a
criminal
prosecution
for
willful
avoidance
of
a
tax
payment
under
the
normal
criminal
provision
of
the
revenue
code.
for
these
reasons,
i
believe
first
that
this
court
are
too
definitely
make
it
clear
that
this
are
withheld
funds
are
expenses
are
not
expenses
and
eats
of
the
employer
to
the
government
but
are
held
in
trust
by
the
government
and
that
the
mere
fact
of
bankruptcy
does
not
defeat
the
trust
set
forth
in
section
7501
and
that
in
addition,
the
trust
in
this
case
ought
to
be
recognize
even
though
the
raise
is
not
specifically
traceable
and
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
which
i
have
collaborated
on.
i
would
like
to
save
whatever
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i'll
just
take
a
minute
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
clarify
one
point.
i
have
been
informed
by
my
co-counsel
that
as
to
the
government's
lien
on
these
taxes
if
it
is
on
real
property,
it
comes
ahead
of
administrative
expenses.
if
it's
on
personal
property
reduced
to
possession,
it
comes
ahead.
but
if
it
is
on
personal
property
not
reduced
to
possession,
it
comes
behind
for
preferred
expenses.
however,
in
a
lien
in
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
cannot
be
perfected
against
the
trustee
in
any
circumstances.
the
government
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
has
a
trust.
it
doesn't
need
it
because
it
has
trust
fund
anyway.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
i
suppose
is
an
undesirable
but
albeit
an
alternative.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh!
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
some
reference.
there
is
a
report
filed
after
the
institution
of
liquid
--
of
the
applicable
liquidation
have
occurred
which
refers
to
a
special
account
in
a
bank
of
special
tax
account
but
the
referee
specifically
found
and
i
guess
this
is
the
facts
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
no
such
moneys
have
in
fact
been
entered
and
it's
unclear
from
the
little
record
we
have
about
this
$200
to
$300
that
it
was
in
fact
a
special
government
account.
and
i
would
say
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
have
to
assume
that
that
we're
going
simply
at
the
general
funds
of
this
estate
in
imposing
the
trust
with
respect
to
those
funds.
i
want
to
say
in
conclusion
only
that,
i
think
that
respondent's
argument
in
this
case
merely
affirms
my
prior
statement
that
neither
the
courts
below
nor
the
respondent
have
dealt
with
the
issue
of
what
is
the
nature
of
these
debts.
are
they
tax
debts
of
the
employer
owed
to
the
government
or
does
the
employer
hold
them
merely
as
collecting
agent
for
debts
of
the
employee.
i
don't
see
on
the
theory
of
that
either
the
court
below
or
respondent
has
gone
on
how
they
would
recognize
this
trust
fund
even
if
the
amounts
--
the
proper
amounts
have
been
segregated.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
their
theory
which
precludes
operation
of
7501
trust
when
a
bankruptcy
proceedings
starts,
the
trustee
would
not
have
been
authorized
to
pay
over
segregated
funds
even
if
he
had
segregated
them
because
they
simply
would
he
no
trust
in
the
time
of
bankruptcy
and
that
is
a
totally
unacceptable
holding
form
our
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
length
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
white.
briefly,
to
reiterate,
we
say
that
first
of
all
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
real
purpose
of
that
second
sentence
was
to
make
sure
that
it
would
be
clear
that
the
tax
remedies
were
available
altogether
to
the
government.
there
was
a
fear
on
congress'
part
that
absent
that
ordinary
tax
remedies
would
not
be
available
precisely
because
this
was
not
a
tax
debt
of
the
bankrupt
and
the
congress
wanted
all
available
procedural
remedies,
trust,
tax,
and
debt
to
be
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
right.
but
even
if
it
is
viewed
as
restrictive
and
i
suppose
it
must
be
said
that
the
nicholas
court
and
i
believe
the
court
went
perhaps
further
than
ahead
to
as
an
alternative
ground,
the
nicholas
court
invoked
this
sentence
to
the
proposition
that
interests
couldn't
be
supported
during
this
time
to
the
extent
that
it
is
limiting.
i
believe
this
case
is
distinguishable
because
even
though
interests
would
have
been
precluded
on
any
debt
--
tax
debt
including
the
employee's
tax
debts
and
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
the
employee's
tax
debts
would
at
no
time
have
been
subjected
to
collecting
limitation
of
being
placed
in
the
bankrupt
employer's
estate
and
his
funds
available
to
general
creditors.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
raises
a
fundamental
question
as
to
the
legal
status
of
taxes
which
an
employer
withholds
from
the
wages
of
his
employees
and
specifically
the
case
raises
the
proper
treatment
of
those
withheld
funds
in
the
event
that
the
employer
becomes
bankrupt
or
in
is
to
a
bankruptcy
procedure.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
relatively
simple.
halo
metal
products,
inc.
filed
a
petition
for
an
arrangement
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
that
is
the
provision
which
allows
operation
of
the
business
to
try
to
stow
up
the
bankruptcy.
it
was
allowed
by
the
referee
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
remain
in
possession
of
the
business
and
to
carry
on
the
business'
operation
subject
to
the
referee
supervision
during
the
chapter
xi
arrangement.
as
is
the
custom
in
such
an
arrangement,
the
referee
entered
in
elaborate
order
requiring
the
debtor
in
possession
to
file
periodic
reports
and
to
maintain
full
records
of
its
operations
during
the
arrangement
period.
and
in
addition,
the
referee
ordered
the
debtor
to
open
up
three
bank
accounts.
first
of
these
accounts
was
to
receive
all
revenues,
received
by
the
business
during
the
operation
in
the
arrangement
period.
and
the
second
account
was
to
receive
periodically
from
the
funds
deposited
in
the
first
revenues
account
the
amount
necessary
to
pay
all
employee
wages
and
disbursements
from
this
payroll
account
were
to
be
made
at
proper
intervals
with
the
approval
of
the
referee.
the
referee
ordered
that
simultaneously
with
meeting
the
debtor
in
possession's
payroll
obligations
that
the
debtor
deposit
into
a
third
special
account
the
amount
of
tax
and
social
security
deductions
that
the
debtor
was
required
to
withhold
from
his
employee's
wages
and
withdrawals
from
this
third
account
were
to
be
allowed
only
for
payment
of
withheld
taxes
and
welfare
benefits
as
those
payments
became
due
to
united
states
government.
the
debtor
failed
almost
entirely
to
comply
with
the
referee's
orders
with
the
orders
of
the
bankruptcy
court
with
respect
to
this
withheld
taxes.
although
the
income
in
social
security
taxes
were
withheld
from
the
employee
wages,
the
withheld
funds
were
not
placed
in
the
special
account
nor
would
they
pay
over
the
united
states
at
the
proper
time
as
required
by
the
arrangement
court.
during
the
arrangement,
the
united
stats
filed
the
proof
of
claim
for
payment
of
a
thousand
and
seventy-five
dollars
that
is
$1,075
of
fica
in
income
taxes
withheld
from
employees
salaries
on
the
ground
that
this
amount
was
a
special
trust
for
the
united
states
benefit
under
section
7501
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
and
about
the
section,
i
shall
elaborate
shortly.
subsequently,
about
three
months
after
the
filing
of
the
original
arrangement
petition,
halo
was
adjudicated
a
bankrupt.
in
a
month
later
on
december
22,
1967,
the
united
states
filed
the
petition
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
asking
that
the
withheld
taxes
at
which
it
claim
as
the
trust
fund
under
section
7501
be
paid
over
to
the
united
states
just
as
any
trust
fund
would
be
paid
over
prior
to
payment
of
the
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
the
referee
denied
the
government's
petition,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
referee's
denial
of
the
petition
and
it
is
that
which
we
are
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
contest
now.
both
of
these
courts
held
essentially
that
halo's
obligation
to
pay
over
to
the
government
the
taxes
withheld
from
employee
wages
was
merely
an
administrative
expense
of
the
bankrupt
estate
and
was
thereby
subject
to
the
scale
of
priorities
established
by
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
with
which
i
am
sure
this
court
is
quite
familiar.
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
view
the
issue
presented
here
which
is
whether
the
government
is
entitled
to
recognition
of
a
trust
fund
for
the
amount
of
taxes
withheld
from
the
salaries
of
the
bankrupt's
employees
during
the
arrangement
period.
as
breaking
down
essentially
into
two
parts,
two
questions.
the
first
question
is
and
this
is
as
really
the
question
is
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
whether
the
trust
fund
concept
is
simply
inapplicable
altogether
as
both
courts
below
seemed
to
have
felt
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
and
the
second
question
which
neither
court
reached
but
which
i
believe
was
the
focus
of
the
bankruptcy
referee's
decision
is
whether
assuming
that
the
trust
does
not
disappear
merely
by
virtue
of
the
withholding
employer's
bankruptcy.
whether
the
trust
is
nonetheless
defeated
or
enjoinment
of
the
trust
is
defeated
by
virtue
of
the
government's
inability
to
trace
the
race
of
the
trust
and
i
will
address
myself
to
both
of
these
questions.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
exactly
right
and
prior
to
several
years
ago,
i
believe
in
1965
when
the
third
circuit
decided
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case,
every
court
that
had
looked
into
this
and
all
the
commentators
as
i
shall
shortly
view
the
question
as
not
one
of
priorities
but
simply
the
recognition
of
a
trust
and
not
a
matter
of
relative
priorities.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
is
it
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
exactly,
exactly
that
is
precisely
what
i
think
is
important
to
show
and
what
we
are
really
alarmed
about
in
this
decision
is
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
these
trust
assets
as
debts
and
viewed
this
case
as
a
matter
of
priorities
between
conflicting
administrative
expenses.
now,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
blackmun
though
it
is
hard
to
trace
as
i
intend
to
discuss
at
length
that
is
hard
to
trace
precisely
what
happen
to
the
funds
one
likely
illogical
assumption
is
that
this
trust
fund
has
simply
been
added
to
the
amount
of
assets
available
to
the
collection
of
the
bankrupt's
creditors
and
therefore
collection
from
those
assets
would
be
windfall
to
those
creditors.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
and
so
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
though
it
was
ordered
by
the
referee
and
it
was
ordered
by
the
referee
that
the
trustee
make
a
transfer
at
the
time
he
paid
the
wages.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
in
fact,
he
never
did.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
and
one
of
the
points
which
i
plan
to
address
myself
to
is
whether
the
enjoyment
of
the
trust
ought
to
be
defeated
by
the
fact
that
the
trustee
never
did
make
these
deposits
and
so
that
all
that
we're
really
talking
about
is
whether
a
trust
ought
to
be
imposed
on
general
assets
of
the
bankrupt
estate.
that
is
the
question
in
this
case
as
we
view
it.
but
that
is
not
the
question
as
court
of
appeals
viewed
it
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
see
exactly
how
the
court
of
appeals
did
identify
this
question
and
to
make
sure
that
what
i
consider
the
gross
misconception
on
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
be
corrected.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
exactly
right.
it's
exactly
right
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
our
theory.
and
that
is
the
theory
of
professor
scott
and
that
is
the
theory
of
all
the
courts
which
have
directed
themselves
to
this
aspect
of
the
case
and
the
theory
which
these
courts
have
gone
on
and
ever
since
we've
gotten
into
this,
i
might
as
well
anticipate
what
i
expected
to
be
a
later
stage
of
the
argument.
the
theory
that
these
courts
have
gone
upon
is
that
yes,
in
a
situation
where
the
raise
of
a
trust
cannot
be
traced
where
you
are
simply
talking
about
general
assets,
it
is
you
run
a
risks
in
either
imposing
the
trust
or
disregarding
the
trust
you
run
a
risks
that
loss
in
the
--
that
the
actual
proceeds
have
been
lost
in
the
accounting
procedure,
there
is
no
record
to
say
where
the
assets
went
and
so
that
either
the
trustee,
either
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust
or
the
general
creditors
may
have
suffered
in
some
way.
now,
this
seems
to
me
the
most
likely
assumption
is
that
the
estate
has
been
fattened
by
the
failure
to
pay
over
these
funds
at
the
designated
time.
and
though
we
want
to
protect
the
creditors
with
respect
to
the
general
assets,
the
estate
has
been
the
view
of
all
the
courts
that
have
considered
this.
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
referee,
the
debtor
in
possession
is
himself
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court
and
because
the
debtor
in
possession
is
the
person
who
buy
his
negligence
failed
to
segregate
these
funds
and
failed
to
setup
the
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
that
we
ought
not
to
make
the
beneficiary
of
a
trust
suffer
because
of
the
negligence
of
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
we
ought
to
give
that
a
beneficiary
the
right
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
an
officer
of
the
bankruptcy
court
is
going
to
do
what
the
bankruptcy
court
tells
him
to
particularly
when
the
bankruptcy
court
states
in
the
order
that
it
shall
supervise
all
these
operations
on
a
weekly
or
monthly
basis.
so
that
all
have
--
all
who
have
considered
this
question
have
felt
that
the
equitable
considerations
which
militate
in
favor
of
recognizing
this
right
to
rely
on
the
bankruptcy
court
doing
what
it
says
its
going
to
do
should
eliminate
the
requirement
of
tracing
the
raise
of
the
trust.
but
i
want
also
to
make
clear
is
that
this
is
not
the
ground.
this
issue
which
i
consider
to
be
the
crucial
issue
of
the
case
is
not
the
issue
that
the
courts
below
went
upon.
the
courts
below
in
my
opinion
fundamentally
misconstrued
the
whole
nature
of
withheld
taxes
and
the
interrelation
of
the
bankruptcy
act
with
this
trust
fund.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
a
very
different
case
from
the
one
we're
facing
mr.
chief
justice,
for
it.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
--
and
i
think
that
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is
perhaps
not
but
i
don't
think
that
controls
the
instant
case
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
if
you
can
identify
the
raise
of
this
trust
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
if
you
can
identify
the
raise
of
this
trust,
i
at
the
moment
find
no
argument
against
the
proposition
that
the
general
assets
of
the
creditors
of
this
company
ought
then
to
be
subject
of
the
government's
tax
claim.
i
would
not
want
to
go
on
record
is
committing
the
government
to
that
position.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
can
trace
the
raise
of
the
trust
then
the
government
ought
to
be
required
to
go
after
trace
of
a
raise
and
the
person
has
clearly
responsible
for
the
ways
of
the
raise
of
that
trust.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
their
liability
with
respect
to
those
withheld
funds
is
discharge
that
the
time
wages
are
paid
and
taxes
withheld
from
those
wages
which
we
think
identifies
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right
there
and
similarly
if
any
refund
is
owed.
if
the
employer
although
withholds
it
is
the
employee
who
has
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
it's
a
trust
for
the
government.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
only
for
the
government.
now,
that
trust
is
set
forth
in
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
quoted
on
page
26
of
our
brief
to
which
i
refer
the
court
and
that
provision
states
as
follows.
“whenever
any
person
is
required
to
collect
or
withhold
any
internal
revenue
tax
from
any
other
person
and
to
pay
over
such
tax
of
the
united
states,
the
amount
of
tax
so
collected
or
withheld
shall
be
held
to
be
a
special
fund
in
trust
for
the
united
states.”
now,
i
take
it
that
neither
respondent
nor
the
courts
below
would
dispute
it
by
virtue
of
section
7501
an
employer
who
withholds
income
and
social
security
taxes
from
his
employee's
salaries
is
the
trustee
of
a
trust
at
least
up
until
the
point
that
the
employer
becomes
insolvent.
now,
let
us
consider
the
case
of
the
employees
--
of
the
employer's
insolvency
and
look
briefly
at
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
is
set
forth
in
relevant
part
of
page
23
of
our
brief.
that
section
entitled
“debts
which
have
priority”
establishes
those
debts
of
the
bankrupt
which
have
priority
over
general
unsecured
creditors
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
that
section
reads
as
follows,
“the
debts
to
have
priority,
in
advance
of
the
payment
of
dividends
to
creditors,
and
to
be
paid
in
full
out
of
bankrupt
estates,
and
the
order
of
payment,
shall
be
(1)
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration
including
the
actual
and
necessary
costs
and
expenses
of
preserving
the
estate
subsequent
to
filing
the
petition.”
and
then
follows
a
general
enumeration
of
expenses
considered
to
be
administrative
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate
followed
by
four
other
categories
of
debts
which
have
priority.
and
i
note
in
that
regard
just
for
the
sake
of
clarity
that
the
fourth
category
of
debts
with
priority
includes
“taxes
which
became
legally
due
knowing
by
the
bankrupt
to
the
united
states
or
to
any
state
or
any
subdivision
thereof”
and
this
priority
for
tax
debts
includes
essentially
tax
debts
which
are
incurred
by
the
employer
prior
to
the
institution
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
it
is
not
disputed
that
tax
debts
incurred
by
the
bankrupt
during
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
are
administrative
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate
in
sharing
the
first
priority
but
that
would
not
in
our
view
include
these
taxes
for
the
reason
i
am
about
to
state.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
my
precise
point
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
we
are
not
in
the
state
of
tension
between
these
two
statutes
for
the
reason
that
though
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
felt
we
were
for
the
reason
that
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
trust
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
deals
with
administrative
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate
and
unless
you
can
at
some
point
identify
withheld
taxes
as
tax
debts
of
the
employers,
there
is
no
tension
because
section
64
has
no
bearing
on
those
amount.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
section
64,
the
bankruptcy
act
is
the
older
of
the
two.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
lends
--
i
think
it
does
lend
us
some
support.
of
course,
there
have
been
--
it
lends
us
some
support
but
the
trust
was
still
congressionally
enacted
even
though
section
64
is
already
on
the
book
and
the
trust
is
not,
the
trust
provision
section
7501
does
not
refer
in
any
way
to
a
limitation
arising
from
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
institution
of
the
trust
fund?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
provision?
yes,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
there
is
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report
of
both
are
unlimited
in
terms
of
explaining
the
purpose
but
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
the
trust
impose
in
section
7501
was
designed
to
forestall
the
possibility
that
courts
would
limit
the
government
to
mere
debt
collection
procedures
and
would
not
allow
either
trust
collection
or
tax
collection
extraordinary
procedures
against
those
withheld
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
withholding
of
income
tax
was
after.
yes,
it
came
between
before
the
withholding
of
income
tax
and
before
the
withholding
of
fica
but
there
was
already
on
the
board's
withholding
a
various
excise
taxes
and
it
was
this
particular
taxes
which
the
original
predecessor
section
7501
was
designed
to
take
care
of.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
is
imperative
to
the
structure
of
the
social
security
act
and
to
the
withholding
of
income
taxes.
yes
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
view
is
that
the
entire
legislative
scheme
which
we
discuss
at
length
at
pages
7
to
10
of
our
brief,
the
entire
legislative
scheme
behind
withholding
of
all
taxes
shows
that
the
government
serves
merely
as
a
collection
agent
with
respect
to
these
taxes
that
these
are
tax
debts
of
the
employee
to
the
government
and
not
of
the
employer
to
the
government.
and
therefore,
that
these
are
neither
taxes
nor
debts
of
the
bankrupt
to
the
government
and
therefore
don't
come
under
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
establish
priorities
for
the
debts
and
expenses
of
the
bankrupt
estate.
essentially,
if
employees
paid
$100
in
wages,
he
receives
$85
and
he
is
considered
to
have
discharged
the
$15
a
tax
liability,
and
the
employer
at
that
point
merely
holds
as
the
tenth
circuit
recently
said
holds
as
a
collection
agent
for
the
government.
he
holds
it
for
a
brief
period
of
time
and
is
required
to
pay
it
over
and
it's
my
submission
to
this
court
that
regardless
of
how
strong
a
policy
section
64,
the
bankruptcy
act
embodies
this
to
the
equal
priority
of
administrative
expenses
does
nothing
in
that
provision
which
converts
trust
funds
into
administrative
expenses
or
which
deals
in
any
way
with
the
bankrupt's
obligation
to
handle
the
funds
which
it
is
receive
in
the
capacity
of
collection
agent
and
neither
of
the
court's
below
nor
the
respondent
trustee
has
attempted
to
answer
this
what
i
considered
to
be
a
crucial
threshold
question
of
what
interplay
it
all
to
section
64
have
on
this
funds.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
think
that
it
certainly
needs
to
be
discussed.
of
course,
this
court
reserved
in
nicholas
the
question
before
us
here.
nicholas
involved
the
question
where
the
interest
on
withheld
taxes
accrues
past
the
period
of
bankruptcy
or
whether
it
stops
with
the
institution
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
or
the
actual
institution
of
bankruptcy.
and
the
court
in
nicholas
held
that
interest
did
not
accrue,
it
held
on
the
broad
general
principle
that
interests
during
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
ought
not
to
accrue
it
all
because
it
eats
away
it
creditors,
assets,
and
creditors
ought
not
be
disadvantaged
merely
because
of
delays
attributable
to
the
long
length
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
a
lien?
not
a
special
lien
mr.
justice
white,
it
does
not
file
a
special
[voice
overlap]
trust
rather
than
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
a
question
that
hasn't
been
tested.
it
hasn't
--
it
can
go
in
i
suppose,
this
hasn't
been
tested
but
i
suppose
it
go
in
under
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
white
except
that
i
believe
that
if
the
lien
is
perfected
that
they
stand
ahead
of
all
and
secured
obligations
including
administrative
expenses
but
i'm
not
sure
about
the
answer
to
that.
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
court
in
the
nicholas
case
cited
the
sentence
of
section
7501
and
i
think
it
is
important
since
no
doubt
the
nicholas
case
will
--
does
have
to
be
examined
to
determine
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
second
sentence
of
section
7501
after
the
trust
is
declared
says
as
follows,
the
withheld
taxes
shall
be
“assessed,
collected,
and
paid”
in
the
same
manner
and
subject
to
the
same
provisions
and
limitation
including
penalties
as
are
applicable
with
respect
to
the
taxes
from
such
fund
arose.
now
we
think
that
as
we've
discussed
in
our
brief
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
makes
it
clear
that
it
was
not
designed
really
though
it
says
limitations,
it
was
not
designed
to
limit
remedies
but
to
expand
government
revenues
but
even
the
quoted
language
taken
at
its
face
value
is
i
think
of
anything
favorable
to
our
position
in
this
case
because
the
phrase
“taxes
from
which
such
fund
arose”
clearly
refers
to
the
income
and
social
security
taxes
owed
by
the
employees
and
withheld
by
the
employer.
and
these
taxes
on
the
employees
would
not
subject
to
any
collection
limitation
by
virtue
of
the
employer's
bankruptcy.
now
they
would
be
subject
in
any
bankruptcy
proceeding
to
a
limitation
on
the
accrual
of
interests
during
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
but
they
would
not
be
subject
to
a
limitation
by
virtue
of
the
employer's
bankruptcy
and
there
and
i
think
lies
the
essential
distinction
even
given
the
fact
that
the
court
relied
on
the
second
sentence
of
section
7501
in
the
nicholas
case.
that
is
the
essential
distinction
between
nicholas
and
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
is
also
an
(inaudible),
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
has
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
could
be.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
he
could
be.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
would
think
he
could
be.
it
is
embezzlement
because
he
is
required
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
have
raised
that.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
will
have
to
say
that
the
government
has
not
attested
at
all
the
whole
range
of
permissible
activity
that
an
employer
can
conduct
with
respect
to
these
withheld
funds.
they
are
due
so
quickly.
in
the
ordinary
case,
they're
paid
over
so
quickly
because
they
are
due
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
know
of
any
special
provision
that
would
cover
that.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
would
think
that
the
embezzling
remedy
would
be
available
but
i
suppose
the
willful,
a
criminal
prosecution
for
willful
avoidance
of
a
tax
payment
under
the
normal
criminal
provision
of
the
revenue
code.
for
these
reasons,
i
believe
first
that
this
court
are
too
definitely
make
it
clear
that
this
are
withheld
funds
are
expenses
are
not
expenses
and
eats
of
the
employer
to
the
government
but
are
held
in
trust
by
the
government
and
that
the
mere
fact
of
bankruptcy
does
not
defeat
the
trust
set
forth
in
section
7501
and
that
in
addition,
the
trust
in
this
case
ought
to
be
recognize
even
though
the
raise
is
not
specifically
traceable
and
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
which
i
have
collaborated
on.
i
would
like
to
save
whatever
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i'll
just
take
a
minute
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
clarify
one
point.
i
have
been
informed
by
my
co-counsel
that
as
to
the
government's
lien
on
these
taxes
if
it
is
on
real
property,
it
comes
ahead
of
administrative
expenses.
if
it's
on
personal
property
reduced
to
possession,
it
comes
ahead.
but
if
it
is
on
personal
property
not
reduced
to
possession,
it
comes
behind
for
preferred
expenses.
however,
in
a
lien
in
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
cannot
be
perfected
against
the
trustee
in
any
circumstances.
the
government
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
has
a
trust.
it
doesn't
need
it
because
it
has
trust
fund
anyway.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
i
suppose
is
an
undesirable
but
albeit
an
alternative.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh!
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
some
reference.
there
is
a
report
filed
after
the
institution
of
liquid
--
of
the
applicable
liquidation
have
occurred
which
refers
to
a
special
account
in
a
bank
of
special
tax
account
but
the
referee
specifically
found
and
i
guess
this
is
the
facts
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
no
such
moneys
have
in
fact
been
entered
and
it's
unclear
from
the
little
record
we
have
about
this
$200
to
$300
that
it
was
in
fact
a
special
government
account.
and
i
would
say
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
have
to
assume
that
that
we're
going
simply
at
the
general
funds
of
this
estate
in
imposing
the
trust
with
respect
to
those
funds.
i
want
to
say
in
conclusion
only
that,
i
think
that
respondent's
argument
in
this
case
merely
affirms
my
prior
statement
that
neither
the
courts
below
nor
the
respondent
have
dealt
with
the
issue
of
what
is
the
nature
of
these
debts.
are
they
tax
debts
of
the
employer
owed
to
the
government
or
does
the
employer
hold
them
merely
as
collecting
agent
for
debts
of
the
employee.
i
don't
see
on
the
theory
of
that
either
the
court
below
or
respondent
has
gone
on
how
they
would
recognize
this
trust
fund
even
if
the
amounts
--
the
proper
amounts
have
been
segregated.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
their
theory
which
precludes
operation
of
7501
trust
when
a
bankruptcy
proceedings
starts,
the
trustee
would
not
have
been
authorized
to
pay
over
segregated
funds
even
if
he
had
segregated
them
because
they
simply
would
he
no
trust
in
the
time
of
bankruptcy
and
that
is
a
totally
unacceptable
holding
form
our
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
length
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
white.
briefly,
to
reiterate,
we
say
that
first
of
all
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
real
purpose
of
that
second
sentence
was
to
make
sure
that
it
would
be
clear
that
the
tax
remedies
were
available
altogether
to
the
government.
there
was
a
fear
on
congress'
part
that
absent
that
ordinary
tax
remedies
would
not
be
available
precisely
because
this
was
not
a
tax
debt
of
the
bankrupt
and
the
congress
wanted
all
available
procedural
remedies,
trust,
tax,
and
debt
to
be
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
right.
but
even
if
it
is
viewed
as
restrictive
and
i
suppose
it
must
be
said
that
the
nicholas
court
and
i
believe
the
court
went
perhaps
further
than
ahead
to
as
an
alternative
ground,
the
nicholas
court
invoked
this
sentence
to
the
proposition
that
interests
couldn't
be
supported
during
this
time
to
the
extent
that
it
is
limiting.
i
believe
this
case
is
distinguishable
because
even
though
interests
would
have
been
precluded
on
any
debt
--
tax
debt
including
the
employee's
tax
debts
and
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
the
employee's
tax
debts
would
at
no
time
have
been
subjected
to
collecting
limitation
of
being
placed
in
the
bankrupt
employer's
estate
and
his
funds
available
to
general
creditors.
thank
you.
