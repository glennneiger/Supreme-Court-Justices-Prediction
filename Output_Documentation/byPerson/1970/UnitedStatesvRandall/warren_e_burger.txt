we'll

arguments
next

against

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
your
theory,
this
statute
along
with
the
order
of
the
court
impresses
a
constructive
trust
on
the
total
receipts
of
the
bankrupt
and
regards
him
as
having
done
what
he
had
been
ordered
to
do,
is
that
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
stone,
let
me
test
your
argument
with
the
hypothetical
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
may.
suppose
the
money
had
been
indeed
put
in
the
segregated
account
and
had
build
up
to
many
thousands
of
dollars
over
a
period
of
time
and
if
the
weekly
check
had
been
made
and
money
was
always
there,
then
the
officer
of
the
company
having
control
of
the
account
suddenly
withdrew
it
all
of
the
segregated
account,
the
tax
--
the
trust
account
that
you're
arguing
about.
withdrew
all
of
it
out
in
currents
--
got
it
in
currency
and
flew
to
argentina.
then
would
you
say
that
you
could
impress
any
trust
--
constructive
trust
on
the
other
assets
of
the
company?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
yes,
i
realize.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
what
i'm
driving
at
is,
i
was
trying
to
setup
a
hypothesis
where
you
could
identify
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
trace
it
all
the
way
to
--
you
can
trace
it
all
the
way
to
argentina
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
your
view
isn't
the
trust
section
imperative
to
the
integrity
of
the
social
security
act
structure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gillogly.
in
order
to
avoid
interrupting
you,
mr.
gillogly,
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
question
to
that
may
help
further
something
on
my
mind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
i
would
assume
that
a
large
employer
like
general
motors
or
others
of
that
category
probably
have
it
any
given
day
millions
of
dollars
in
the
segregated
account.
now
hypothetically,
assume
the
impossible
which
is
that
congress
acted
very
swiftly
with
simply
abolished
the
whole
statutory
scheme.
whose
property
would
that
account
to
the
fund?
who
would
be
the
owners
of
that
fund?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
would
they
be
the
legal
owner
only
or
the
equitable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don't
you
think
the
equitable
title
would
vest
in
the
employees
if
the
act
had
been
repealed?
the
employees
had
made
this
contributions
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
right.
the
act
is
repealed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
employees.
in
other
words,
had
have
(inaudible)
an
accounting
procedure
to
unscramble
this
very
large
omelet
and
give
to
each
employee
what
he
had
according
to
the
records
of
the
employer
contributed
to
that
fund.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
thinking
at
one
step
at
a
time.
i
have
just
taken
the
first
stage
and
then
you
can
pursue
it
with
justice
white's
illustration
and
see
where
you'd
come
out
and
see
whether
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
pursue
with
the
hypothetical
a
little
bit
beyond
that.
take
a
trust
company
bank
that
has
a
large
trustee
fund
and
the
bank
becomes
insolvent
and
goes
through
these
processes,
are
they
accounts
of
the
trust
department
or
the
trust
company
segregated
accounts?
would
they
ever
find
there
way
into
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
of
the
corporate
trustee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
all
hypothetical.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
hypothetical.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
general
creditors
could
reach
into
the
segregated
accounts
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust?
you
don't
mean
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
not
a
trust
pool.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
equitable
owner
in
the
trust
company
hypothetical
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
taking
you
off
enough
--
track.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
would
you
say
has
benefited
by
the
money
which
should
have
lawfully
been
put
in
to
the
segregated
accounts
but
which
was
not
put
in
according
to
both
the
statute
and
the
directions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
the
government
stand
in
the
shoes
--
since
the
government
has
had
to
take
on
the
responsibility
of
discharging
the
employees
for
that
obligation?
doesn't
the
government
stand
on
the
shoes
of
those
employees?
shouldn't
they
preferably?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
of
equitable
--
established
equitable
principles
relating
to
trusts?
chief

you
have
four

remaining.
