insofar

(a)
(2)
would

it?

i
understand
that
you're
saying
that
even
so
the
state
court
has
no
jurisdiction?

that's
just
a

there

do
you
agree

with
the
adjudication
in

the
so

justice
william

yes.
justice
william

douglas
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william

douglas
well,
i
mean
is
it
the
principle
that
you
think
would
generally
apply
to
this
litigation?
justice
william

douglas
the
findings
of
the
master
that
the
setting
aside
of
the
indian
reservation
carried
with
it
by

the
right
to
use
water
because
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have
a
viable
reservation.
justice
william

douglas
again
i
gather
you
answered
me
earlier
that
it
may
be
even
as
to
those
rights,
they
are
superior
rights?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
appropriation
right
couldn't
override
any
reserved
right.
i
mean
the
government
sets
aside
and
then
the
appropriators
come
in,
sets
aside
a
federal
entrapment
that
river
of
course.
justice
william

nobody
knows
