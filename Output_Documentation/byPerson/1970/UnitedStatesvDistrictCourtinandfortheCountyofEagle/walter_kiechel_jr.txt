mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
from
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
and
presents
two
questions
important
to
the
proper
administration
and
conservation
of
the
water
resources
of
colorado
and
nationally.
first,
whether
congress
by
enacting
so
called
mccarran
amendment
codified
at
43,
united
states
codes
666
intended
to
consent
to
a
suit
against
the
united
states
for
adjudication
of
its
water
rights
in
one
of
70
water
districts
of
the
state
of
colorado.
and
secondly,
whether
in
the
absence
of
any
expressly
stated
intent
to
subject
?reserved
rights
of
the
united
states?
to
state
court
adjudication.
such
intent
can
be
implied.
i
plan
to
discuss
preliminary
and
briefly
the
nature
of
water
adjudications
of
the
west
and
specifically
that
proceeding
here
involved
in
colorado
then
address
the
threshold
question
of
the
application
or
the
rule
in
this
court's
opinion
in
dugan
v.
rank
in
372
u.s.
holding
that
the
consent
applied
only
to
general
adjudications
then
discussed
the
legislative
history
of
the
consent
statute
and
lastly,
the
nature
and
extent
of
reserve
water
rights
and
the
ability
of
the
state
courts
of
colorado
to
adjudicate
them.
historically,
water
rights
were
judicially
determined
in
the
western
states
by
flat
title
action
initiated
by
one
or
more
water
users.
the
other
claimants
to
water
rights
on
the
stream
system
were
joined.
each
party
affirmatively
presented
its
claim
and
contested
the
claims
of
others.
this
proceeding
resulted
in
a
determination
by
quantity
and
priority
of
the
rights
of
the
parties
inter
se
say
that
has
developed
in
most
to
the
western
states,
statutory
modification
of
this
procedure
or
by
the
state
engineer
or
some
other
official
initiates
the
proceeding
and
presents
the
evidence
in
the
first
instance,
but
it
instance
remains
the
same.
a
determination
by
the
court
of
the
rights
of
all
the
parties
on
the
supreme
system
inter
se
say.
this
proceeding
was
initiated
in
1967
in
the
water
district
37
which
at
that
time
was
one
of
70
water
districts
of
the
state
of
colorado.
these
districts
were
established
on
water
shed
lines.
water
district
37,
being
the
water
shed
of
the
eagle
river,
the
eagle
river
being
a
tributary
of
the
colorado
river.
this
was
a
supplemental
proceeding,
there
being
a
number
of
adjudications
in
water
district
37
over
the
years.
first
one,
over
eight
years
ago
and
the
last
one
as
recently
as
in
1966,
the
year
before
the
instant
proceeding
was
initiated.
now,
a
significant
attribute
of
a
supplemental
proceeding
under
colorado
law
is
that
the
earliest
priority
decreed
in
such
an
adjudication
must
be
later
than
the
last
priory
date
decreed
in
the
preceding
adjudication.
or
stated
otherwise,
all
rights
awarded
in
a
new
supplemental
proceeding
such
as
one
before
the
court
are
necessarily
junior
by
operation
of
colorado
law
to
those
decreed
in
previous
adjudications.
this
supplemental
proceeding
was
initiated
by
the
colorado
river
water
conservation
district
which
adds
before
adjudication
a
decree
of
certain
of
its
claimed
water
rights.
other
claimants
appeared
and
the
conservation
district
sought
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
partner.
the
united
states
moved
to
have
itself
dismissed,
asserting
among
other
things
that
this
was
not
the
type
of
proceeding
that
the
congress
has
consented.
the
motion
was
denied
by
the
district
court
of
colorado
for
eagle
county
and
the
united
states
sought
a
writ
from
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
to
prohibit
the
district
court
from
asserting
jurisdiction
over
it.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
determined
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
properly
denied
and
rendered
an
extensive
opinion
in
which
have
held
first
that
congress
had
intended
to
include
the
water
adjudication
procedure
of
colorado
among
the
suits
to
which
it
had
consented.
secondly,
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
notwithstanding
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
consent
statute
in
dugan
v.
rank
that
the
statute
permits
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
a
supplemental
proceeding
involving
only
a
tributary
water
shed.
with
respect
to
reserved
water
rights
of
the
united
states,
the
colorado
supreme
court
strongly
suggested
that
the
united
states
had
no
water
rights
in
colorado
except
those
arising
under
state
law.
the
court
said
that
the
decisions
of
this
court,
including
arizona
v.
california
in
373,
u.s.
were
not
determinative.
indeed,
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
that
the
only
decision
that
might
be
determinative
of
this
question
was
one
of
its
own
and
that
if
the
colorado
supreme
court
determined
that
the
united
states
has
reserved
rights
in
colorado
streams
then
that
decision
would
or
that
determination
would
require
the
overruling
of
its
previous
decision.
and
in
that
previous
decision
upon
which
the
colorado
supreme
court
relies
and
it
refers
to
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
colorado
supreme
court
had
said
that
by
admitting
colorado
into
the
union
with
a
provision
in
its
constitution
declaring
on
appropriated
waters
within
the
state
to
be
the
property
of
and
subject
to
appropriation
by
the
people
of
the
state,
that
the
united
states
lost
any
right
to
assert
water
rights
in
colorado
except
those
required
by
appropriation
subject
to
a
state
law.
and
in
its
ultimate
holding
here
for
review,
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
whatever
water
rights
the
united
states
has,
such
rights,
including
reserved
rights,
can
be
recognized
and
adequately
adjudicated
by
the
colorado
district
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that
is
correct
he
did
not.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes
your
honor
if
the
--
with
respect
to
the
congressional
intent
of
the
application
of
the
consent
statute,
it
is
necessary
to
decide
whether
those
rights
were
included
within
the
waiver
of
the
sovereign
immunity
that
congress
enacted
in
the
mccarran
amendment.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
douglas
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
it
is
indeed.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
wouldn't
know
the
percentage.
the
record
of
the
case
shows
that
many
of
the
water
rights
of
the
united
states
arise
on
national
forest
and
those
are
claimed
as
reserved
rights.
others
are
appropriative
rights
by
other
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
i
suppose
that
the
great
majority
of
the
water
rights
claimed
by
the
united
states
in
water
district
37
are
reserved
rights.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes
indeed.
that
is
our
position
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
cover
the
rights
acquired
under
state
law,
that
was
the
specification
of
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
we
say
that
because
with
respect
to
rights
acquired
under
state
law,
this
is
not
a
general
adjudication
in
the
terms
of
this
court's
rule
in
dugan
v.
rank.
in
that
case,
your
honor
please,
it
involved
part
of
the
san
joaquin
river
of
california
and
there
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
had
dismissed
the
united
states
as
a
party,
united
states
having
been
joined
there
under
the
authority
of
the
consent
statute,
43
u.s.
666.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
--
the
matter
of
the
scope
of
the
proceeding
to
which
congress
consented
that
united
states
be
joined.
the
ninth
circuit
had
said,
i'm
quoting
from
this
court's
opinion
372,
u.s.
on
618,
617
pardon
me,
?this
court
stated
that
we
go
directly
to
the
question
of
joinder
of
the
united
states
as
a
party.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue,
and
therefore,
do
not
consider
the
contention
at
length.?
now,
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
the
type
of
suit
congress
had
in
mind
was
a
quasi
public
proceeding,
known
as
a
general
adjudication
of
a
stream
system,
one
and
which
the
rights
of
all
claimants
on
a
stream
system
has
between
themselves
are
ascertained
and
officially
stated.
and
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
it
is
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
in
part
your
honor;
it's
neither
a
river
system
or
a
general
adjudication
geographically
nor
is
it
a
general
adjudication
with
respect
to
having
all
parties
before
the
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
consent
statute.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
your
honor
mr.
justice
white
that
the
reason
that
i
say
it
is
not
a
general
adjudication
is
that
not
all
of
the
parties
are
before
the
court
having
rights.
further
more,
the
colorado
law
which
bars
the
assertion
and
decree
does
not
just
bar
the
assertion,
but
it
bars
the
decree
of
any
earlier
rights.
that
is
the
rights
earlier
than
the
supplemental
proceeding
precludes
a
general
adjudication.
it
prevents
a
party
joined
in
the
supplemental
proceeding
in
1967
from
asserting
its
priory
of
1905
as
many
of
the
rights
of
the
united
states
are
in
this
case.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
says
that
their
lower
courts
held
the
plenary
power
to
accommodate
the
award
of
earlier
priorities
as
to
asserted
in
a
supplemental
procedure.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
they
said
as
to
both
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
but
your
question
is
addressed
to
appropriative
rights
and
i
am
responding
to
it
so
that
if
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
is
correct,
but
they
gave
no
specific
construction
or
direction
to
the
lower
court,
they
just
said
that,
that
the
lower
court
can
accommodate
somehow
and
modify
or
re-write
this
provision
of
the
colorado
law
which
says
no
priority
earlier
than
the
supplemental
proceeding.
then,
if
water
district
37
were
a
river
system
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
then
the
state
acquired
rights
or
the
rights
acquired
under
state
law
could
be
adjudicated
in
my
opinion
assuming
that
all
parties
who
had
rights
were
joined,
all
parties
on
that
river
system
and
this
is
not
the
nature
of
this
procedure
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
outside
of
the
colorado
conservation
district,
there
is
one
of
the
interveners
a
zinc
company
and
several
other
claimants,
but
certainly
it's
far
from
having
before
the
water
district
court
--
the
court
of
eagle
county,
all
of
the
water
claimants
of
the
eagle
system.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that
is,
yes
i
can
imagine
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
the
traditional
adjudication,
that
is
the
way
in
which
water
rights
of
the
west
have
been
historically
determined
to
have
all
the
parties
before
it.
i
say
that
that
was
the
type
of
adjudication,
the
proceeding
to
which
congress
--
that
congress
had
in
mind
and
this
is
very
clear
from
the
senate
report
which
is
referred
to
in
the
court's
opinion
in
dugan
v.
rank.
the
senate
report
755,
which
was
the
report
by
which
the
senate
judiciary
committee
reported
favorably
to
mccarran
bill
and
that
report
shows
unmistakably
that
it
was
this
general
adjudication
in
which
all
parties
were
present
and
that
was
the
type
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
their
consent.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
do
argue
it
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
say
that
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
to
quality
under
the
statute
in
this
court's
rule
in
dugan
v.
rank,
you
would
have
to
have
all
of
the
tributaries
and
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
if
they
are
claimants
to
water
rights
on
the
colorado
river,
yes.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
if
they
are
claiming
rights
to
use
water
of
the
colorado
river
or
its
tributaries
in
the
state
of
colorado,
yes.
i
believe
that,
that
is
within
this
court's
decision
in
dugan
v.
rank.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
douglas
water
rights
adjudications
are
by
nature
are
prolonged,
cumbersome
and
multi-party.
this
is
nothing
new.
the
congress
had
this
certainly
in
mind
when
they
enacted
consent
statute.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
when
you
use
the
word
?one
single
type,?
i
would
agree
that
it
is
the
general
type,
the
historic
type
of
determination
judicially
of
water
rights
to
which
congress
was
consenting.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i'm
not
making
any
argument
ti
that
effect,
no
sir.
but
i
was
answering
your
question
as
to
the
congressional
intent
and
i
think
that
not
only
the
senate
report,
the
discussion
on
the
floor,
all
of
those
things
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
mccarran
amendment
show
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
traditional
type
of
water
adjudication,
have
in
mind
state
a
right
acquired
under
state
law.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
if
united
states
has
to
be
joined
in
an
adjudication
under
the
consent
statute
that
the
requisites,
the
perquisites
of
that
jointer
must
be
satisfied
by
those
who
are
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
there's
any
defiance
by
the
united
states.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
if
we're
talking
about
rights
under
state
law
still
and
i
would
suggest
that
those
congress
had
in
mind
could
adjudicated
in
a
state
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
responded
to
your
earlier
question
by
saying
that
if
the
colorado
--
if
the
eagle
river
were
a
river
system
and
if
the
colorado
district
court
could
accommodate
this
bar
gate
that
i
saw
no
reason
why
united
states
couldn't
be
joined
and
be
required
to
assert
its
rights
acquired
by
appropriation
under
state
law
and
be
subject
to
the
decree
of
the
court
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
there
is
no
lack
of
water
adjudications
passed
and
being
in
process
in
the
state
of
colorado
that
the
water
--
colorado
conversation
district
sought
to
bring
the
united
states
in
this
case.
so
that
it
is
a
matter
at
the
instance
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
petitioner
to
join
the
united
states
and
if
in
the
absence
of
jointer
or
in
the
absence
of
satisfaction
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute
united
states
is
not
a
party
to
these
proceedings
then,
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
there
are
many
and
they
have
been
assembled
and
i
believe
that
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
record
in
the
case
and
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
the
reserved
right
doctrine
says
that
the
quantum
of
the
right
is
that
amount
of
water
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
reservation,
arizona
v.
california.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
oh!
no
mr.
justice
white.
they
can
quantified.
there
is
no
--
i'm
not
saying
that
they
can't
be
quantified.
the
record
shows
on
page
7.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
have
the
reference
to
the
record.
i
will
supply
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
it
shows
that
the
rights
as
i
said
in
earlier
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas
that
most
of
the
rights
to
be
asserted
in
water
district
37
are
reserved
rights
on
national
forest,
but
with
respect
to
your
question
as
to
whether
they
can
be
quantified,
they
can
be
quantified.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
they
are
established.
no,
there
would
be
no
contemplation
of
establishment.
they
are
by
operation
of
the
doctrine
and
the
rule
of
law
established
by
the
creation
of
the
reservation,
but
as
far
as
the
quantification,
considerable
effort
has
been
done
to
an
inventory
and
catalog
of
those
rights
and
they
are
determined
by
amount
and
location.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
not
as
party
defendant
joined
under
43
u.s.c.,
666
because
we
think
there
is
no
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
there
have
been
instances
in
which
those
rights
have
been
asserted
affirmatively
by
the
united
states
as
plaintiff.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
when
you
say
no
plans
that
there
is
this
considerable
activity
of
inventorying
the
rights.
the
department
of
justice
may
assert
proposals
to
the
public
land
law
review
commission
with
respect
to
a
means
by
which
these
rights
can
be
more
early
way
identified
and
quantified.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
the
proposals
of
department
of
justice
which
are
reflected
in
the
public
land
law
review
commission
report
shows
that
an
administrative
determination
which
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
it's
not
within
this
consent
statute.
i
would
want
to
make
one
qualification
of
an
earlier
question
which
i
do
not
change
that
they
can
be
quantified,
but
there
is
always
a
certain
open
endness
or
flexibility
to
a
reserved
right
because
of
the
nature
of
it.
inherently
in
that
right
is
the
need
or
the
requirement
to
meet
the
ultimate
--
to
meet
the
purposes,
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
reservation
and
that
by
definition
includes
a
certain
flexibility
and
the
right.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
we
are
participating,
have
participated
in
a
number
of
water
adjudication
proceedings.
in
some
and
perhaps
all,
we
have
raised
certain
jurisdictional
defenses,
but
they
have
been
--
the
problems
in
those
instances
in
other
states
i
might
say
have
been
overcome
and
the
united
states
has
adjudicated
and
presented
for
adjudication
its
rights
pursuant
to
this
statute
in
other
proceedings.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
can
we?
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
we
cannot,
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
there
have
been
determination
well
as
we
have
as
i
indicated
earlier
as
plaintiff
in
some
the
fallbrook
case
in
southern
california
and
united
states
was
plaintiff
there
but
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
there
have
been
determinations
by
the
state
court
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
over
our
objection
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
that
it
was
a
river
system
and
that
--
and
in
case
there
was
not
this
problem
of
adjudicating
going
back
and
given
a
true
priority
to
our
rights
acquired
under
state
law.
in
fact,
i
think
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
the
state
of
washington
brief
presents
its
litigation
program,
number
of
cases
that
it
has
brought
under
--
in
that
state
and
which
the
united
states
has
been
joined
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
they
include
one
of
the
decrees
which
shows
that
the
state
court
recognized
the
reserved
right
and
decreed
in
certain
quantity
with
the
provision
or
proviso
that
if
at
a
later
time
there
should
be
additional
need
for
additional
water
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
reservation,
this
was
within
the
contemplation
of
the
decree.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
we
took
no
appeal
from
that
decision
of
the
lower
washington
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
reserved
rights
were
not
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yeah,
you're
quite
right.
i'm
sorry
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
indeed
sir.
they
did
entail
what
was
determined
to
be
a
river
system,
the
chehalis
creek
river
system,
but
there
was
not
as
followed
in
that
case,
in
that
state
of
the
bar
date
of
the
priority
and
i
might
say
mr.
justice
white
in
all
candor
i
think
that
the
united
states
and
i
want
admit
that
they
have
asserted
reserved
rights
in
state
court
adjudications
because
this
court
has
not
spoken
on
this
matter
and
it
was
still
--
until
that
determination
is
made
that
in
abundance
of
caution
as
an
advocate
does,
those
rights
are
asserted
notwithstanding
our
position
here
and
i
might
say
in
further
answer
to
your
question
that
we
are
very
concerned
about
the
state
--
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
which
go
at
the
existence
of
reserved
rights
in
the
state
of
colorado.
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
declare,
reaffirm
the
reserved
by
doctrine
with
specific
application
to
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
please
the
supreme
court
of
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
we
have
asserted.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
if
we
have
asserted
and
made
known
those
reserved
rights,
they
are
before
the
court.
those
are
rights
which
we
will
assert
in
water
district
37,
if
we
are
required
to
proceed.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
easily,
but
it
could
be
done
as
a
part
of
plaintiff
yes
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
is
common
to
both
of
these
cases
and
i
will
treat
it
in
the
later
case
if
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
from
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
and
presents
two
questions
important
to
the
proper
administration
and
conservation
of
the
water
resources
of
colorado
and
nationally.
first,
whether
congress
by
enacting
so
called
mccarran
amendment
codified
at
43,
united
states
codes
666
intended
to
consent
to
a
suit
against
the
united
states
for
adjudication
of
its
water
rights
in
one
of
70
water
districts
of
the
state
of
colorado.
and
secondly,
whether
in
the
absence
of
any
expressly
stated
intent
to
subject
?reserved
rights
of
the
united
states?
to
state
court
adjudication.
such
intent
can
be
implied.
i
plan
to
discuss
preliminary
and
briefly
the
nature
of
water
adjudications
of
the
west
and
specifically
that
proceeding
here
involved
in
colorado
then
address
the
threshold
question
of
the
application
or
the
rule
in
this
court's
opinion
in
dugan
v.
rank
in
372
u.s.
holding
that
the
consent
applied
only
to
general
adjudications
then
discussed
the
legislative
history
of
the
consent
statute
and
lastly,
the
nature
and
extent
of
reserve
water
rights
and
the
ability
of
the
state
courts
of
colorado
to
adjudicate
them.
historically,
water
rights
were
judicially
determined
in
the
western
states
by
flat
title
action
initiated
by
one
or
more
water
users.
the
other
claimants
to
water
rights
on
the
stream
system
were
joined.
each
party
affirmatively
presented
its
claim
and
contested
the
claims
of
others.
this
proceeding
resulted
in
a
determination
by
quantity
and
priority
of
the
rights
of
the
parties
inter
se
say
that
has
developed
in
most
to
the
western
states,
statutory
modification
of
this
procedure
or
by
the
state
engineer
or
some
other
official
initiates
the
proceeding
and
presents
the
evidence
in
the
first
instance,
but
it
instance
remains
the
same.
a
determination
by
the
court
of
the
rights
of
all
the
parties
on
the
supreme
system
inter
se
say.
this
proceeding
was
initiated
in
1967
in
the
water
district
37
which
at
that
time
was
one
of
70
water
districts
of
the
state
of
colorado.
these
districts
were
established
on
water
shed
lines.
water
district
37,
being
the
water
shed
of
the
eagle
river,
the
eagle
river
being
a
tributary
of
the
colorado
river.
this
was
a
supplemental
proceeding,
there
being
a
number
of
adjudications
in
water
district
37
over
the
years.
first
one,
over
eight
years
ago
and
the
last
one
as
recently
as
in
1966,
the
year
before
the
instant
proceeding
was
initiated.
now,
a
significant
attribute
of
a
supplemental
proceeding
under
colorado
law
is
that
the
earliest
priority
decreed
in
such
an
adjudication
must
be
later
than
the
last
priory
date
decreed
in
the
preceding
adjudication.
or
stated
otherwise,
all
rights
awarded
in
a
new
supplemental
proceeding
such
as
one
before
the
court
are
necessarily
junior
by
operation
of
colorado
law
to
those
decreed
in
previous
adjudications.
this
supplemental
proceeding
was
initiated
by
the
colorado
river
water
conservation
district
which
adds
before
adjudication
a
decree
of
certain
of
its
claimed
water
rights.
other
claimants
appeared
and
the
conservation
district
sought
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
partner.
the
united
states
moved
to
have
itself
dismissed,
asserting
among
other
things
that
this
was
not
the
type
of
proceeding
that
the
congress
has
consented.
the
motion
was
denied
by
the
district
court
of
colorado
for
eagle
county
and
the
united
states
sought
a
writ
from
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
to
prohibit
the
district
court
from
asserting
jurisdiction
over
it.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
determined
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
properly
denied
and
rendered
an
extensive
opinion
in
which
have
held
first
that
congress
had
intended
to
include
the
water
adjudication
procedure
of
colorado
among
the
suits
to
which
it
had
consented.
secondly,
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
notwithstanding
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
consent
statute
in
dugan
v.
rank
that
the
statute
permits
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
a
supplemental
proceeding
involving
only
a
tributary
water
shed.
with
respect
to
reserved
water
rights
of
the
united
states,
the
colorado
supreme
court
strongly
suggested
that
the
united
states
had
no
water
rights
in
colorado
except
those
arising
under
state
law.
the
court
said
that
the
decisions
of
this
court,
including
arizona
v.
california
in
373,
u.s.
were
not
determinative.
indeed,
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
that
the
only
decision
that
might
be
determinative
of
this
question
was
one
of
its
own
and
that
if
the
colorado
supreme
court
determined
that
the
united
states
has
reserved
rights
in
colorado
streams
then
that
decision
would
or
that
determination
would
require
the
overruling
of
its
previous
decision.
and
in
that
previous
decision
upon
which
the
colorado
supreme
court
relies
and
it
refers
to
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
colorado
supreme
court
had
said
that
by
admitting
colorado
into
the
union
with
a
provision
in
its
constitution
declaring
on
appropriated
waters
within
the
state
to
be
the
property
of
and
subject
to
appropriation
by
the
people
of
the
state,
that
the
united
states
lost
any
right
to
assert
water
rights
in
colorado
except
those
required
by
appropriation
subject
to
a
state
law.
and
in
its
ultimate
holding
here
for
review,
the
colorado
supreme
court
held
that
whatever
water
rights
the
united
states
has,
such
rights,
including
reserved
rights,
can
be
recognized
and
adequately
adjudicated
by
the
colorado
district
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that
is
correct
he
did
not.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes
your
honor
if
the
--
with
respect
to
the
congressional
intent
of
the
application
of
the
consent
statute,
it
is
necessary
to
decide
whether
those
rights
were
included
within
the
waiver
of
the
sovereign
immunity
that
congress
enacted
in
the
mccarran
amendment.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
douglas
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
it
is
indeed.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
wouldn't
know
the
percentage.
the
record
of
the
case
shows
that
many
of
the
water
rights
of
the
united
states
arise
on
national
forest
and
those
are
claimed
as
reserved
rights.
others
are
appropriative
rights
by
other
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
i
suppose
that
the
great
majority
of
the
water
rights
claimed
by
the
united
states
in
water
district
37
are
reserved
rights.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes
indeed.
that
is
our
position
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
cover
the
rights
acquired
under
state
law,
that
was
the
specification
of
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
we
say
that
because
with
respect
to
rights
acquired
under
state
law,
this
is
not
a
general
adjudication
in
the
terms
of
this
court's
rule
in
dugan
v.
rank.
in
that
case,
your
honor
please,
it
involved
part
of
the
san
joaquin
river
of
california
and
there
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
had
dismissed
the
united
states
as
a
party,
united
states
having
been
joined
there
under
the
authority
of
the
consent
statute,
43
u.s.
666.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
--
the
matter
of
the
scope
of
the
proceeding
to
which
congress
consented
that
united
states
be
joined.
the
ninth
circuit
had
said,
i'm
quoting
from
this
court's
opinion
372,
u.s.
on
618,
617
pardon
me,
?this
court
stated
that
we
go
directly
to
the
question
of
joinder
of
the
united
states
as
a
party.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue,
and
therefore,
do
not
consider
the
contention
at
length.?
now,
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
the
type
of
suit
congress
had
in
mind
was
a
quasi
public
proceeding,
known
as
a
general
adjudication
of
a
stream
system,
one
and
which
the
rights
of
all
claimants
on
a
stream
system
has
between
themselves
are
ascertained
and
officially
stated.
and
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
it
is
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
in
part
your
honor;
it's
neither
a
river
system
or
a
general
adjudication
geographically
nor
is
it
a
general
adjudication
with
respect
to
having
all
parties
before
the
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
consent
statute.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
your
honor
mr.
justice
white
that
the
reason
that
i
say
it
is
not
a
general
adjudication
is
that
not
all
of
the
parties
are
before
the
court
having
rights.
further
more,
the
colorado
law
which
bars
the
assertion
and
decree
does
not
just
bar
the
assertion,
but
it
bars
the
decree
of
any
earlier
rights.
that
is
the
rights
earlier
than
the
supplemental
proceeding
precludes
a
general
adjudication.
it
prevents
a
party
joined
in
the
supplemental
proceeding
in
1967
from
asserting
its
priory
of
1905
as
many
of
the
rights
of
the
united
states
are
in
this
case.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
says
that
their
lower
courts
held
the
plenary
power
to
accommodate
the
award
of
earlier
priorities
as
to
asserted
in
a
supplemental
procedure.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
they
said
as
to
both
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
but
your
question
is
addressed
to
appropriative
rights
and
i
am
responding
to
it
so
that
if
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
is
correct,
but
they
gave
no
specific
construction
or
direction
to
the
lower
court,
they
just
said
that,
that
the
lower
court
can
accommodate
somehow
and
modify
or
re-write
this
provision
of
the
colorado
law
which
says
no
priority
earlier
than
the
supplemental
proceeding.
then,
if
water
district
37
were
a
river
system
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
then
the
state
acquired
rights
or
the
rights
acquired
under
state
law
could
be
adjudicated
in
my
opinion
assuming
that
all
parties
who
had
rights
were
joined,
all
parties
on
that
river
system
and
this
is
not
the
nature
of
this
procedure
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
outside
of
the
colorado
conservation
district,
there
is
one
of
the
interveners
a
zinc
company
and
several
other
claimants,
but
certainly
it's
far
from
having
before
the
water
district
court
--
the
court
of
eagle
county,
all
of
the
water
claimants
of
the
eagle
system.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that
is,
yes
i
can
imagine
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
the
traditional
adjudication,
that
is
the
way
in
which
water
rights
of
the
west
have
been
historically
determined
to
have
all
the
parties
before
it.
i
say
that
that
was
the
type
of
adjudication,
the
proceeding
to
which
congress
--
that
congress
had
in
mind
and
this
is
very
clear
from
the
senate
report
which
is
referred
to
in
the
court's
opinion
in
dugan
v.
rank.
the
senate
report
755,
which
was
the
report
by
which
the
senate
judiciary
committee
reported
favorably
to
mccarran
bill
and
that
report
shows
unmistakably
that
it
was
this
general
adjudication
in
which
all
parties
were
present
and
that
was
the
type
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
their
consent.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
do
argue
it
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
say
that
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
to
quality
under
the
statute
in
this
court's
rule
in
dugan
v.
rank,
you
would
have
to
have
all
of
the
tributaries
and
the
mainstream
of
the
colorado
river
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
if
they
are
claimants
to
water
rights
on
the
colorado
river,
yes.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
if
they
are
claiming
rights
to
use
water
of
the
colorado
river
or
its
tributaries
in
the
state
of
colorado,
yes.
i
believe
that,
that
is
within
this
court's
decision
in
dugan
v.
rank.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
douglas
water
rights
adjudications
are
by
nature
are
prolonged,
cumbersome
and
multi-party.
this
is
nothing
new.
the
congress
had
this
certainly
in
mind
when
they
enacted
consent
statute.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
when
you
use
the
word
?one
single
type,?
i
would
agree
that
it
is
the
general
type,
the
historic
type
of
determination
judicially
of
water
rights
to
which
congress
was
consenting.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i'm
not
making
any
argument
ti
that
effect,
no
sir.
but
i
was
answering
your
question
as
to
the
congressional
intent
and
i
think
that
not
only
the
senate
report,
the
discussion
on
the
floor,
all
of
those
things
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
mccarran
amendment
show
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
traditional
type
of
water
adjudication,
have
in
mind
state
a
right
acquired
under
state
law.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
if
united
states
has
to
be
joined
in
an
adjudication
under
the
consent
statute
that
the
requisites,
the
perquisites
of
that
jointer
must
be
satisfied
by
those
who
are
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
there's
any
defiance
by
the
united
states.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
if
we're
talking
about
rights
under
state
law
still
and
i
would
suggest
that
those
congress
had
in
mind
could
adjudicated
in
a
state
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
responded
to
your
earlier
question
by
saying
that
if
the
colorado
--
if
the
eagle
river
were
a
river
system
and
if
the
colorado
district
court
could
accommodate
this
bar
gate
that
i
saw
no
reason
why
united
states
couldn't
be
joined
and
be
required
to
assert
its
rights
acquired
by
appropriation
under
state
law
and
be
subject
to
the
decree
of
the
court
in
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
there
is
no
lack
of
water
adjudications
passed
and
being
in
process
in
the
state
of
colorado
that
the
water
--
colorado
conversation
district
sought
to
bring
the
united
states
in
this
case.
so
that
it
is
a
matter
at
the
instance
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
petitioner
to
join
the
united
states
and
if
in
the
absence
of
jointer
or
in
the
absence
of
satisfaction
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute
united
states
is
not
a
party
to
these
proceedings
then,
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
there
are
many
and
they
have
been
assembled
and
i
believe
that
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
record
in
the
case
and
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
the
reserved
right
doctrine
says
that
the
quantum
of
the
right
is
that
amount
of
water
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
reservation,
arizona
v.
california.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
oh!
no
mr.
justice
white.
they
can
quantified.
there
is
no
--
i'm
not
saying
that
they
can't
be
quantified.
the
record
shows
on
page
7.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
have
the
reference
to
the
record.
i
will
supply
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
it
shows
that
the
rights
as
i
said
in
earlier
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas
that
most
of
the
rights
to
be
asserted
in
water
district
37
are
reserved
rights
on
national
forest,
but
with
respect
to
your
question
as
to
whether
they
can
be
quantified,
they
can
be
quantified.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
they
are
established.
no,
there
would
be
no
contemplation
of
establishment.
they
are
by
operation
of
the
doctrine
and
the
rule
of
law
established
by
the
creation
of
the
reservation,
but
as
far
as
the
quantification,
considerable
effort
has
been
done
to
an
inventory
and
catalog
of
those
rights
and
they
are
determined
by
amount
and
location.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
not
as
party
defendant
joined
under
43
u.s.c.,
666
because
we
think
there
is
no
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
there
have
been
instances
in
which
those
rights
have
been
asserted
affirmatively
by
the
united
states
as
plaintiff.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
when
you
say
no
plans
that
there
is
this
considerable
activity
of
inventorying
the
rights.
the
department
of
justice
may
assert
proposals
to
the
public
land
law
review
commission
with
respect
to
a
means
by
which
these
rights
can
be
more
early
way
identified
and
quantified.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
the
proposals
of
department
of
justice
which
are
reflected
in
the
public
land
law
review
commission
report
shows
that
an
administrative
determination
which
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
it's
not
within
this
consent
statute.
i
would
want
to
make
one
qualification
of
an
earlier
question
which
i
do
not
change
that
they
can
be
quantified,
but
there
is
always
a
certain
open
endness
or
flexibility
to
a
reserved
right
because
of
the
nature
of
it.
inherently
in
that
right
is
the
need
or
the
requirement
to
meet
the
ultimate
--
to
meet
the
purposes,
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
reservation
and
that
by
definition
includes
a
certain
flexibility
and
the
right.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
we
are
participating,
have
participated
in
a
number
of
water
adjudication
proceedings.
in
some
and
perhaps
all,
we
have
raised
certain
jurisdictional
defenses,
but
they
have
been
--
the
problems
in
those
instances
in
other
states
i
might
say
have
been
overcome
and
the
united
states
has
adjudicated
and
presented
for
adjudication
its
rights
pursuant
to
this
statute
in
other
proceedings.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
can
we?
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
we
cannot,
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
there
have
been
determination
well
as
we
have
as
i
indicated
earlier
as
plaintiff
in
some
the
fallbrook
case
in
southern
california
and
united
states
was
plaintiff
there
but
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
there
have
been
determinations
by
the
state
court
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
over
our
objection
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
--
that
it
was
a
river
system
and
that
--
and
in
case
there
was
not
this
problem
of
adjudicating
going
back
and
given
a
true
priority
to
our
rights
acquired
under
state
law.
in
fact,
i
think
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
the
state
of
washington
brief
presents
its
litigation
program,
number
of
cases
that
it
has
brought
under
--
in
that
state
and
which
the
united
states
has
been
joined
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
they
include
one
of
the
decrees
which
shows
that
the
state
court
recognized
the
reserved
right
and
decreed
in
certain
quantity
with
the
provision
or
proviso
that
if
at
a
later
time
there
should
be
additional
need
for
additional
water
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
reservation,
this
was
within
the
contemplation
of
the
decree.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
we
took
no
appeal
from
that
decision
of
the
lower
washington
court.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
reserved
rights
were
not
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
yeah,
you're
quite
right.
i'm
sorry
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
no,
indeed
sir.
they
did
entail
what
was
determined
to
be
a
river
system,
the
chehalis
creek
river
system,
but
there
was
not
as
followed
in
that
case,
in
that
state
of
the
bar
date
of
the
priority
and
i
might
say
mr.
justice
white
in
all
candor
i
think
that
the
united
states
and
i
want
admit
that
they
have
asserted
reserved
rights
in
state
court
adjudications
because
this
court
has
not
spoken
on
this
matter
and
it
was
still
--
until
that
determination
is
made
that
in
abundance
of
caution
as
an
advocate
does,
those
rights
are
asserted
notwithstanding
our
position
here
and
i
might
say
in
further
answer
to
your
question
that
we
are
very
concerned
about
the
state
--
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
which
go
at
the
existence
of
reserved
rights
in
the
state
of
colorado.
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
declare,
reaffirm
the
reserved
by
doctrine
with
specific
application
to
the
state
of
colorado.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
please
the
supreme
court
of
--
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
well,
we
have
asserted.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
if
we
have
asserted
and
made
known
those
reserved
rights,
they
are
before
the
court.
those
are
rights
which
we
will
assert
in
water
district
37,
if
we
are
required
to
proceed.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
kiechel,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
easily,
but
it
could
be
done
as
a
part
of
plaintiff
yes
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
is
common
to
both
of
these
cases
and
i
will
treat
it
in
the
later
case
if
my
time
has
expired.
