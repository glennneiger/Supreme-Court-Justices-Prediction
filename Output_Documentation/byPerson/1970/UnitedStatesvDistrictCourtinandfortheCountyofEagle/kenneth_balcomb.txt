mr.
kenneth
balcomb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
client,
the
colorado
river
water
conservation
district
is
an
state
organization
by
statute
obligated
to
protect
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
for
the
state
of
colorado
--
that
is
the
waters
for
the
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries
within
the
state
and
it
was
in
this
pursuit
of
this
goal
that
i
as
counsel
for
the
district
in
the
adjudication
proceedings
and
in
water
district
number
37
caused
the
united
states
of
america
to
be
served.
because
as
is
indicated
they
not
only
have
substantial
what
i
would
call
rights
acquired
under
state
law,
but
substantial
rights
that
they
denominate
as
reserved
rights.
now,
this
water
district
number
37
encompasses
the
entire
eagle
river
and
its
tributaries
and
it's
a
rather
substantial
stream
though
you
might
say
small
by
comparison
to
colorado
as
a
whole,
nonetheless
is
a
compact
adjudication
and
administration
unit.
it
is
incidentally
included
within
the
area
that
is
involved
in
the
second
case
number
812,
the
division
5
case
by
reason
of
subsequent
colorado
law
amendments.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
view
the
main
and
principle
issue
in
this
case
your
honor
to
be
whether
or
not
the
state
courts
in
state
adjudicating
--
adjudicatory
procedures
have
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states
if
they
comply
with
the
service
requirements
of
the
mccarran
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
which
we
deem
was
granted
by
the
mccarran
amendment
over
the
united
states
upon
compliance
with
that
act
as
to
whether
you
have
to
break
this
out
and
i
do
not
believe
you
do
until
a
distinction
between
the
classes
of
rights
to
the
united
states
says
it
claims.
we
do
not
believe
it
to
be
necessary
because
once
you're
over
the
jurisdictional
problem,
it
looks
like
to
me
it
was
intent
of
the
act
to
catch
all
rights.
otherwise,
there
was
no
point
in
joining
the
united
states
at
all.
they
only
have
to
bring
in
part
of
their
bucket
of
water,
the
balance
of
the
bucket
water
still
being
hidden
the
whole
purpose
to
mccarran
amendment
is
lost
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
claim
with
jurisdiction
does,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
touch
kind
of
briefly
in
at
least
partial
response
to
some
of
the
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
on
just
exactly
what
an
adjudication
is
under
the
colorado
law
and
if
i
correctly
understand
the
laws
of
the
other
involved
states
primarily
the
17
western
arid
and
semi-arid
states,
colorado
has
a
really
somewhat
difference
system
of
the
balance
or
had
at
least
under
the
1943
act
and
that
was
purely
judicial,
without
any
involvement
of
a
state
officer.
but
nonetheless
it
was
a
state
sponsored
or
what
the
pacific
live
stock
case
decided
by
this
court
said
was
a
quasi
judicial
proceeding
sponsored
with
the
public,
quasi
public.
at
the
time
that
the
mccarran
amendment
was
passed,
i
would
say,
though
i
don't
know
this
precisely,
that
of
the
70
water
districts
referred
to
by
counsel,
probably
all
but
two
or
three
had
already
had
not
won
the
original
proceeding
but
possibly
a
half
a
dozen
others
or
more
denominated
supplementary
adjudications.
and
i
just
do
not
believe
it
can
be
possible
that
the
congress
intended
in
passing
this
law,
knowing
full
well
at
all
of
the
states
as
it
recognized,
that
long
head
this
type
of
system
intended
to
waste
its
times
by
passing
an
amendment
which
would
not
allow
the
enjoinment
of
the
united
states
because
the
proceeding
is
very
denominated
as
in
this
case
supplemental.
now,
the
subject
matter
of
an
adjudication
proceeding
is
not
people,
it
is
the
river
itself
that
raises
the
water
and
it
is
a
kind
of
an
action
in
rem
and
it
is
a
continuing
action
because
its
purpose
is
to
establish,
in
the
order
priority,
the
rights
of
those
persons
and
entities
claiming
the
right
to
use
water
out
of
the
particular
stream
involved.
so
though
you
use
supplementary
when
you
start
an
action
similar
to
the
one
that
was
started
in
eagle
county
as
involved
here,
nonetheless,
it
means
it
was
in
addition
to
a
continuation
of
the
original
proceedings
commenced
in
that
county
great
many
years
before
and
serves
as
the
method
and
the
means
of
not
only
quantifying
the
water
right,
but
putting
it
on
the
water
rights
ladder
in
its
proper
order.
and
that
is
all,
if
i
correctly
read
the
pacific
live
stock
case
that
any
western
water
adjudication
proceeding
does,
it's
established
under
the
appropriation
doctrine.
it
attempts
to
establish
a
comprehensive,
expeditious,
economical
scheme
to
provide
for
the
fixing
of
water
rights
and
their
distribution
and
determines
who
is
first
who
is
last.
it
provides
all
the
way
through
it,
for
at
least
if
not
initially,
and
a
final
appeal
to
the
court
to
establish
all
these
rights.
now,
questions
have
been
asked
of
counsel
for
the
united
states
regarding
whether
or
not
united
states
is
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
there
was.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
drafted
the
petition
i
should
know,
but
my
guess
would
be
as
early
as
1885
and
there
were
probably
10
or
12
supplementals
after
that.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
not
in
water
district
37
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
it
did,
but
i
doubt
that
they
go
back
prior
to
the
1900.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
some
of
the
supplemental
proceedings
that
were
after
the
passage
of
the
mccarran
amendment,
well
it
wasn't
until
as
we
view,
at
least
as
i--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
sir?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
or
more,
i'm
not
even
sure
of
that.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
till
1952
they
could
not
rejoin
because
they
had
not
raised
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
don't
believe
the
people
of
the
--
most
of
the
western
states
that
were
initiating
and
starting
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
were
particularly
concerned
about
this
so
called
reserved
right
problem
until
this
court
it's
decision
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well,
under
the
colorado
system,
primarily
the
--
in
person
or
the
applicant
who
opens
the
adjudication
proceeding
might
not
even
be
conscious
of
the
mccarran
amendment
or
have
any
concern
about
the
rights
of
the
federal
government.
it
is
the
people
more
interested
in
protecting
the
overall
state
rights
who
after
arizona
versus
california
relies
that
the
government
in
colorado
could,
if
she
pursued
her
approach
that
was
used
in
arizona
versus
california
and
dry
up
the
river.
it
was
just
as
simple
as
that
and
so
they
began
then
to
be
concerned
and
worry
about
whether
or
not
the
united
states
could
be
brought
in.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes,
they
are
bound.
they
have
a
limitation
statute
that
compel
that
to
be
binding.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
would
say,
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
to
make
a
strict
guess
out
of
that,
i
would
say
no.
i
might
observe
that
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
this
problem
is
raised
by
the
united
states
itself
and
not
by
anyone
else
and
citing
the
previous
arizona
versus
california
case
to
supreme
court
of
colorado,
they
said
we
have
never
been
a
part
in
the
action.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
says
you
can't
--
the
united
states
says
you
can't
bind
us
until
we
have
been
properly
a
party
and
therefore
the
prior
proceedings
cannot
cut
off
the
right
of
the
united
states.
and
as
i
understand
the
discussion
of
this
problem
by
mr.
justice
groves
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
he
was
reciting
in
effect
the
position
of
the
parties.
he
only
really
made
one
decision
for
the
court
and
that
was
that
colorado
courts
are
capable
of
adjudicating
the
water
rights
of
the
united
states
just
like
anybody
else.
he
didn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
could
andante
prior
decrees,
but
indicated
they
probably
could.
a
variety
of
questions
he
mentioned
in
passing,
but
he
did
not
necessarily
reach
them.
now,
i
would
like
to
if
i
could
touch
very
briefly
upon
some
of
the
cases
in
which
in
one
way
or
the
another,
the
united
states
is
been
involved,
effecting
the
water
rights
on
particular
streams
in
particular
states
and
whether
or
not
they
took
this
attitude
that
they
are
now
taking
in
this
case.
if
i
correctly
understand
the
washington
brief
and
i
believe
that
i
do,
page
10
of
the
washington
brief
in
in
in
re
chehalis
creek,
okanogan
county
is
cited
and
it
is
the
case
to
which
counsel
referred
that
it
is
just
one
of
nine
streams
in
which
the
state
of
washington
has
caused
united
states
to
be
joined
and
their
names
would
indicate
to
me
that
they
are
certainly
no
larger
or
more
prominent
than
the
eagle
river,
in
re
bonaparte
creek,
in
harvey
creek
creek,
in
re
magic
creek
and
this
got
a
matter
and
in
only
one
of
those
did
united
states
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
river
system
was
involved,
raised
this
before
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
washington
and
apparently
lost
the
matter
on
remand.
the
other
case
mentioned
by
counsel
involves
utah,
there
have
been
several
there.
the
most
principal
case
involving
this
particular
section
was
the
in
re
green
river
case
decided
by
judge
chilson.
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
the
united
states
federal
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
conduct
the
adjudication
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
rather
than
this
question
of
a
stream
system
being
involved.
now,
we
have
kind
of
i
believe
exhaustively
briefed
this
problem
with
regard
to
what
the
statute
intended
to
cover
at
the
time
of
its
passage.
we
think
it
very
clear
as
has
been
indicated
by
answers
to
questions
here
that
it
was
intended
to
be
allowed
if
the
united
states
had
one
appropriative
right
on
a
stream
to
join
united
states
in
the
action.
certainly
as
a
minimum,
this
is
what
the
mccarran
amendment
was
intended
to
reach.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
believe
at
the
time
your
honor
that
this
particular
act
was
passed,
this
question
about,
i
mean,
utilization
of
the
word
?reserved?
in
the
connection
of
the
water
rights
was
not
in
too
common
parlance,
not
even
by
the
government
itself.
it
had
be
come
up
only
as
an
implied
reservation
in
connection
with
indian
reservations
and
was
not
considered
to
be
particularly
serious.
i
do
think
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
passing
mccarran
amendment
and
utilizing
it
or
otherwise
was
to
avoid
a
long
listing,
it
can
cover
such
things
as
condemnation
or
right
as
subject
and
certainly
was
not
intended
by
use
of
that
word
to
exclude
reserved
rights,
because
i
believe
it
intended
to
catch
everything.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
they
certainly
did
at
the
time
in
the
mind
of
the
department
of
interior
witnesses
who
testified
as
well
as
the
department
of
justice
who
testified
and
pointed
out
that
this
language
that
you're
using
is
a
general
waiver
and
if
we
are
brought
into
the
court,
we'll
have
to
prove
up
on
all
of
our
rights,
our
indian
rights,
our
military
rights,
things
of
this
nature
and
they
then
did
not
call
them
reserved
rights,
they
were
specific
by
naming
those
rights.
and
i
think
that
the
letters
from
justice
and
from
interior
department
show
very
clearly
that
they
were
concerned
that
the
waiver
was
too
broad
and
in
both
letters
made
the
suggestion
that
the
waiver
should
be
confined
to
state
appropriated
rights
and
as
the
committee
report
755
notes,
they
considered
this
and
rejected
it,
considering
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
as
i
understand
the
legislative
history
your
honor,
it
was
a
combination
of
apparently
of
circumstances,
an
inability
in
senator
mccarran's
home
state
to
properly
administer
a
little
stream
called
the
queen
river
which
had
some
75
rights
adjudicated
out
of
it,
three
of
them
of
which
the
government
had
purchased.
there
was
the
two
pending
cases
in
the
united
states
district
court.
one
of
them
which
is
not
yet
in
judgment,
concerning
the
truckee
and
the
carson
rivers
and
the
rights
of
the
indian
for
the
recollection
project
there
which
apparently
had
involved
there.
there
was
the
fallbrook
cases
that
counsel
for
the
government
mentioned
that
were
bothering
then
senator
nixon
and
senator
nolan.
there
was
a
variety
of
these
kind
of
things,
even
the
colorado
senators
mentioned
the
problem
that
existing
in
connection
with
the
blue
river
which
was
then
pending
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
his
warning
you
might
say,
the
congress
--
the
step
that
they
were
about
to
take,
exemplifies
their
thought
that
it
covered
all
water
rights
was
not
related
to
expense
items
which
were
in
the
government
or
anything
like
that.
it
was
considered
by
the
people
who
sponsored
the
absolutely
necessary
to
bring
certainty
into
the
field
of
water
rights
in
the
west.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
you'd
have
to
have
a
district
attorney
in
every
county
in
western
united
states.
i
might
say
--
it
has
been
suggested
of
course,
well,
why
doesn't
this
court
give
the
justice
department
and
the
other
federal
agencies
time
to
make
a
list
and
put
it
somewhere?
well,
in
1952,
this
was
part
of
the
legislation
in
rejecting
and
they
have,
18
years
since
then,
the
time
this
suit
was
really
going
and
they
haven't
made
a
list
yet
until
they
were
brought
into
court.
but
when
they
were
brought
in
the
court
as
the
appendix
indicates,
they
were
able
to
detail
in
particularity
their
uses,
not
only
appropriative
but
also
reserved
uses
within
the
area
of
the
eagle
river.
i
wanted
to
touch,
if
i
might,
briefly
upon
some
11
to
12,
13
cases,
at
least
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
as
reported
decisions
that
relate
to
or
refer
to
this
particular
section
666.
counsel
has
mentioned
the
only
one
i
believe
it
is
been
this
court
for
a
direct
decision
on
it,
there
were
two
count
cases
at
the
time,
that's
in
dugan
versus
rank.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
every
time
this
court
or
the
circuit
court
for
the
ninth
circuit
or
for
practical
matter
any
other
court
has
held
that
666
did
not
confer
jurisdiction,
that
it
was
not
a
quasi
public
suit
that
was
involved.
it
was
request
for
declaratory
relief,
injunction,
sometimes
denominated
a
class
action
and
court
said
in
every
circumstance
that
is
not
what's
involved
because
it
is
not
the
quasi
public
proceeding
called
a
general
adjudication
in
western
states.
and
the
only
case
the
really
reaches
this
point
is
the
very
first
one
on
the
list
and
that's
the
in
re
green
river
case
that
judge
christensen
decided
in
utah.
and
he
thoroughly
discusses
the
legislative
history,
finds
that
it
was
intended
that
united
states
be
joined,
does
not
concern
himself
with
the
difference
in
kinds
of
rights,
but
merely
said,
go
back
to
the
state
court,
they
have
the
machinery.
i've
noted
that
sometimes
the
adjudications
in
utah,
they
go
on
for
years
and
there
is
thousands
of
people
involved
and
the
federal
court
just
doesn't
have
time
to
take
care
of
this.
this
got
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts
that
has
appropriate
machinery.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
another
point
and
it
is
this
attitude
of
the
government
today
and
the
attitude
as
changed
over
the
years
of
various
times
that
brings
i
think
monumental
confusion
for
the
other
departments
of
the
government.
they
don't
know
what
to
do.
the
four
sets
of
regulations
concerning
what
they
ought
to
do
change
time
and
again.
it
ends
up
that
if
united
states
is
not
held
into
this
action.
there
is
only
one
kind
of
right
that
must
be
barred
according
the
state
law
and
that
would
be
your
reclamation
rights
by
reason
of
section
8.
i
think
that
the
principle
problem
is
not
whether
or
not
a
reserve
right
exists,
but
if
it
does
in
fact
exist
when
--
what
occasion,
when
it
was
reserved
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
what
is
the
derivation?
i
believe
it
can
commence
with
witters
(ph)
and
progress
there
to
various
indian
reservation
matters
until
finally
culminating
in
arizona
versus
california.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no
sir,
i
don't
so
read
the
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
eagle
county
case
below?
no
sir,
i
do
not.
in
fact,
i
think
the
mr.
justice
groves
refused
to
reach
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
stockman
versus
leddy,
as
reaching
the
reserved
right
question?
that
reached
the
date
to
appropriation
question
i
believe
your
honor.
reserved
right
question
to
my
knowledge
is
not
been
reached
in
colorado.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that
whether
or
not
there's
a
reserved
right?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
subject
to
review
here
and
that's
the
right
of
the
government
if
the
colorado
courts
as
they're
afraid
will
not
follow
the
law,
but
i
submit
that
i
suggest
that
the
colorado
courts
will
follow
the
law,
both
federal
and
state
law,
without
hesitation.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that's
the
way
i
view
the
statute,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
if
i
as
opening
proceeding
i
have
not,
no,
sir.
in
fact,
as
i
would
give
recognition
to
them,
i'll
only
inquire
as
to
what
is
the
quantity
and
what
is
the
date.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
just
because
you
denominated
reservation
between
bad
and
the
word
?appropriation.?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that's
correct.
i
think
that
united
states
would
be
entitled
to
the
extent
of
a
can
show
what's
right
to
whatever
date
it
was
that
they
said
this
water
is
ours.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
might
be
subordinate
to
some
that
came
into
existence,
ahead
of
those
rights
of
united
states
(voice
overlaps)
to
the
other.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
what
i'm
trying
to
say
your
honor
is
that
i
recognize
united
states
does
have
appropriate
rights
under
state
law
and
likewise
has
appropriative
rights
under
federal
law,
they
chose
to
call
it
reserved
rights
under
the
federal
law.
those
are
all
implied,
they
have
to
be
found,
those
letter.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
do
i
agree
with
it?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
the
fact
system
quantity
but
i
certainly
agree
with
the
theory
that
was
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
i
do.
i
don't
think
i
have
very
much
choice
in
that
regard
in
any
[attempt
to
laughter]
event.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
we
agree
with
that
whole
heartedly
your
honor,
we
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
unquestionably,
if
the
indian
reservation
will
say
or
the
forest
was
withdrawn
in
1900
and
there
were
a
variety
water
rights
acquired
prior
thereto
they
would
be
a
likewise
entitled
to
their
priority
date,
that
is
the
appropriation
system.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
it
can't
go
back
when
they
came
into
existence
your
honor.
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
don't
believe
so.
no,
i
don't
mean
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no,
because
the
government's
claim
in
1905
here
not
1877.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
agree
with
the
position
the
government
takes
that
they're
entitled
to
show
their
date
and
go
back
to
it,
unquestionably
and
to
the
extent
that
this
takes
out
other
appropriate
rights,
i
guess
that's
just
one
of
the
ways
the
game
is
play
but
that's
the
purpose
of
the
system.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
i
can
answer
the
question
this
way
your
honor
is
that
about
1897,
i
believe
that
the
organic
act
setup
the
forests
and
largely,
they
were
timber
reserves
and
there
were
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
timber.
now,
i
would
say
in
that
original
withdraw,
this
was
the
purpose
for
which
the
water
was
drawn
and
whatever
the
united
states
could
show
it
needed
for
this
purpose
it's
be
entitled
to
reserve.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
in
1960,
i
believe
it
was
the
act
concerning
multiple
use
of
federal
land
went
in
when
they
dumped
all
these
other
things
and
on
top
of
it
as
a
purpose
for
the
forest.
and
it
might
be
the
court
would
--
a
court
would
hold
that
as
to
some
of
these
rights
that
the
united
states
claims
they
would
have
to
come
and
clear
up
to
1960.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no
what
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
can't
certainly
understand
that
some
of
them
would
be
so
de
minimis
that
there
would
no
point
wasting
time,
but
the
government
is
in
a
better
position
to
say
then
we
what's
that
going
to
be,
that's
the
problem.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
they
do
your
honor,
they
were
perfectly
able
to
list
in
the
eagle
county.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
were
able
to
that
there
also,
they
spoke
of
their
general
reserved
rights
and
then
spoke
of
these
things
that
they
were
going
to
claim
specifically
which
as
i
view
it,
is
a
double
claim
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
sir?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
have
not
offered
them
for
adjudication
and
that's
all
we
ask
them
to
do
and
all
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
direct
them
to
do
so.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
direct
the
government
to
offer
its
claims
for
adjudication
and
as
is
indicated
if
the
colorado
courts,
the
utah
courts,
the
washington
courts
go
straight
as
court
is
doing
here
is
to
straighten
that
problem
out.
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
state
courts
are
not
going
to
follow
federal
law
when
they
are
specifically
enjoined
to
follow.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
there
is.
as
matter
as
i
view
its
appearance
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong.
is
it
wrong
to
allow
the
government
standout
here
with
this
open
ended
mortgage
or
is
it
right
to
make
them
bring
that
open
ended
mortgage
into
court
and
declare
their
rights,
i
should
say
equitable
way
to
proceed
as
i
view.
i
might
mention,
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
that
there
is
a
--
i
would
have
an
opportunity
of
course
after
mr.
kiechel
speaks
concerning
a-12,
but
there
is
an
amazing
similarity
between
these
cases
and
i
think
that
the
result
probably
should
be
the
same.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
client,
the
colorado
river
water
conservation
district
is
an
state
organization
by
statute
obligated
to
protect
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
for
the
state
of
colorado
--
that
is
the
waters
for
the
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries
within
the
state
and
it
was
in
this
pursuit
of
this
goal
that
i
as
counsel
for
the
district
in
the
adjudication
proceedings
and
in
water
district
number
37
caused
the
united
states
of
america
to
be
served.
because
as
is
indicated
they
not
only
have
substantial
what
i
would
call
rights
acquired
under
state
law,
but
substantial
rights
that
they
denominate
as
reserved
rights.
now,
this
water
district
number
37
encompasses
the
entire
eagle
river
and
its
tributaries
and
it's
a
rather
substantial
stream
though
you
might
say
small
by
comparison
to
colorado
as
a
whole,
nonetheless
is
a
compact
adjudication
and
administration
unit.
it
is
incidentally
included
within
the
area
that
is
involved
in
the
second
case
number
812,
the
division
5
case
by
reason
of
subsequent
colorado
law
amendments.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
view
the
main
and
principle
issue
in
this
case
your
honor
to
be
whether
or
not
the
state
courts
in
state
adjudicating
--
adjudicatory
procedures
have
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states
if
they
comply
with
the
service
requirements
of
the
mccarran
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
which
we
deem
was
granted
by
the
mccarran
amendment
over
the
united
states
upon
compliance
with
that
act
as
to
whether
you
have
to
break
this
out
and
i
do
not
believe
you
do
until
a
distinction
between
the
classes
of
rights
to
the
united
states
says
it
claims.
we
do
not
believe
it
to
be
necessary
because
once
you're
over
the
jurisdictional
problem,
it
looks
like
to
me
it
was
intent
of
the
act
to
catch
all
rights.
otherwise,
there
was
no
point
in
joining
the
united
states
at
all.
they
only
have
to
bring
in
part
of
their
bucket
of
water,
the
balance
of
the
bucket
water
still
being
hidden
the
whole
purpose
to
mccarran
amendment
is
lost
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
claim
with
jurisdiction
does,
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to
touch
kind
of
briefly
in
at
least
partial
response
to
some
of
the
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
on
just
exactly
what
an
adjudication
is
under
the
colorado
law
and
if
i
correctly
understand
the
laws
of
the
other
involved
states
primarily
the
17
western
arid
and
semi-arid
states,
colorado
has
a
really
somewhat
difference
system
of
the
balance
or
had
at
least
under
the
1943
act
and
that
was
purely
judicial,
without
any
involvement
of
a
state
officer.
but
nonetheless
it
was
a
state
sponsored
or
what
the
pacific
live
stock
case
decided
by
this
court
said
was
a
quasi
judicial
proceeding
sponsored
with
the
public,
quasi
public.
at
the
time
that
the
mccarran
amendment
was
passed,
i
would
say,
though
i
don't
know
this
precisely,
that
of
the
70
water
districts
referred
to
by
counsel,
probably
all
but
two
or
three
had
already
had
not
won
the
original
proceeding
but
possibly
a
half
a
dozen
others
or
more
denominated
supplementary
adjudications.
and
i
just
do
not
believe
it
can
be
possible
that
the
congress
intended
in
passing
this
law,
knowing
full
well
at
all
of
the
states
as
it
recognized,
that
long
head
this
type
of
system
intended
to
waste
its
times
by
passing
an
amendment
which
would
not
allow
the
enjoinment
of
the
united
states
because
the
proceeding
is
very
denominated
as
in
this
case
supplemental.
now,
the
subject
matter
of
an
adjudication
proceeding
is
not
people,
it
is
the
river
itself
that
raises
the
water
and
it
is
a
kind
of
an
action
in
rem
and
it
is
a
continuing
action
because
its
purpose
is
to
establish,
in
the
order
priority,
the
rights
of
those
persons
and
entities
claiming
the
right
to
use
water
out
of
the
particular
stream
involved.
so
though
you
use
supplementary
when
you
start
an
action
similar
to
the
one
that
was
started
in
eagle
county
as
involved
here,
nonetheless,
it
means
it
was
in
addition
to
a
continuation
of
the
original
proceedings
commenced
in
that
county
great
many
years
before
and
serves
as
the
method
and
the
means
of
not
only
quantifying
the
water
right,
but
putting
it
on
the
water
rights
ladder
in
its
proper
order.
and
that
is
all,
if
i
correctly
read
the
pacific
live
stock
case
that
any
western
water
adjudication
proceeding
does,
it's
established
under
the
appropriation
doctrine.
it
attempts
to
establish
a
comprehensive,
expeditious,
economical
scheme
to
provide
for
the
fixing
of
water
rights
and
their
distribution
and
determines
who
is
first
who
is
last.
it
provides
all
the
way
through
it,
for
at
least
if
not
initially,
and
a
final
appeal
to
the
court
to
establish
all
these
rights.
now,
questions
have
been
asked
of
counsel
for
the
united
states
regarding
whether
or
not
united
states
is
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
there
was.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
drafted
the
petition
i
should
know,
but
my
guess
would
be
as
early
as
1885
and
there
were
probably
10
or
12
supplementals
after
that.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
not
in
water
district
37
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
it
did,
but
i
doubt
that
they
go
back
prior
to
the
1900.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
some
of
the
supplemental
proceedings
that
were
after
the
passage
of
the
mccarran
amendment,
well
it
wasn't
until
as
we
view,
at
least
as
i--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
sir?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
or
more,
i'm
not
even
sure
of
that.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
till
1952
they
could
not
rejoin
because
they
had
not
raised
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
don't
believe
the
people
of
the
--
most
of
the
western
states
that
were
initiating
and
starting
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
were
particularly
concerned
about
this
so
called
reserved
right
problem
until
this
court
it's
decision
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well,
under
the
colorado
system,
primarily
the
--
in
person
or
the
applicant
who
opens
the
adjudication
proceeding
might
not
even
be
conscious
of
the
mccarran
amendment
or
have
any
concern
about
the
rights
of
the
federal
government.
it
is
the
people
more
interested
in
protecting
the
overall
state
rights
who
after
arizona
versus
california
relies
that
the
government
in
colorado
could,
if
she
pursued
her
approach
that
was
used
in
arizona
versus
california
and
dry
up
the
river.
it
was
just
as
simple
as
that
and
so
they
began
then
to
be
concerned
and
worry
about
whether
or
not
the
united
states
could
be
brought
in.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes,
they
are
bound.
they
have
a
limitation
statute
that
compel
that
to
be
binding.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
would
say,
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
to
make
a
strict
guess
out
of
that,
i
would
say
no.
i
might
observe
that
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
this
problem
is
raised
by
the
united
states
itself
and
not
by
anyone
else
and
citing
the
previous
arizona
versus
california
case
to
supreme
court
of
colorado,
they
said
we
have
never
been
a
part
in
the
action.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
says
you
can't
--
the
united
states
says
you
can't
bind
us
until
we
have
been
properly
a
party
and
therefore
the
prior
proceedings
cannot
cut
off
the
right
of
the
united
states.
and
as
i
understand
the
discussion
of
this
problem
by
mr.
justice
groves
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
he
was
reciting
in
effect
the
position
of
the
parties.
he
only
really
made
one
decision
for
the
court
and
that
was
that
colorado
courts
are
capable
of
adjudicating
the
water
rights
of
the
united
states
just
like
anybody
else.
he
didn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
could
andante
prior
decrees,
but
indicated
they
probably
could.
a
variety
of
questions
he
mentioned
in
passing,
but
he
did
not
necessarily
reach
them.
now,
i
would
like
to
if
i
could
touch
very
briefly
upon
some
of
the
cases
in
which
in
one
way
or
the
another,
the
united
states
is
been
involved,
effecting
the
water
rights
on
particular
streams
in
particular
states
and
whether
or
not
they
took
this
attitude
that
they
are
now
taking
in
this
case.
if
i
correctly
understand
the
washington
brief
and
i
believe
that
i
do,
page
10
of
the
washington
brief
in
in
in
re
chehalis
creek,
okanogan
county
is
cited
and
it
is
the
case
to
which
counsel
referred
that
it
is
just
one
of
nine
streams
in
which
the
state
of
washington
has
caused
united
states
to
be
joined
and
their
names
would
indicate
to
me
that
they
are
certainly
no
larger
or
more
prominent
than
the
eagle
river,
in
re
bonaparte
creek,
in
harvey
creek
creek,
in
re
magic
creek
and
this
got
a
matter
and
in
only
one
of
those
did
united
states
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
river
system
was
involved,
raised
this
before
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
washington
and
apparently
lost
the
matter
on
remand.
the
other
case
mentioned
by
counsel
involves
utah,
there
have
been
several
there.
the
most
principal
case
involving
this
particular
section
was
the
in
re
green
river
case
decided
by
judge
chilson.
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
the
united
states
federal
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
conduct
the
adjudication
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
rather
than
this
question
of
a
stream
system
being
involved.
now,
we
have
kind
of
i
believe
exhaustively
briefed
this
problem
with
regard
to
what
the
statute
intended
to
cover
at
the
time
of
its
passage.
we
think
it
very
clear
as
has
been
indicated
by
answers
to
questions
here
that
it
was
intended
to
be
allowed
if
the
united
states
had
one
appropriative
right
on
a
stream
to
join
united
states
in
the
action.
certainly
as
a
minimum,
this
is
what
the
mccarran
amendment
was
intended
to
reach.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
believe
at
the
time
your
honor
that
this
particular
act
was
passed,
this
question
about,
i
mean,
utilization
of
the
word
?reserved?
in
the
connection
of
the
water
rights
was
not
in
too
common
parlance,
not
even
by
the
government
itself.
it
had
be
come
up
only
as
an
implied
reservation
in
connection
with
indian
reservations
and
was
not
considered
to
be
particularly
serious.
i
do
think
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
passing
mccarran
amendment
and
utilizing
it
or
otherwise
was
to
avoid
a
long
listing,
it
can
cover
such
things
as
condemnation
or
right
as
subject
and
certainly
was
not
intended
by
use
of
that
word
to
exclude
reserved
rights,
because
i
believe
it
intended
to
catch
everything.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
they
certainly
did
at
the
time
in
the
mind
of
the
department
of
interior
witnesses
who
testified
as
well
as
the
department
of
justice
who
testified
and
pointed
out
that
this
language
that
you're
using
is
a
general
waiver
and
if
we
are
brought
into
the
court,
we'll
have
to
prove
up
on
all
of
our
rights,
our
indian
rights,
our
military
rights,
things
of
this
nature
and
they
then
did
not
call
them
reserved
rights,
they
were
specific
by
naming
those
rights.
and
i
think
that
the
letters
from
justice
and
from
interior
department
show
very
clearly
that
they
were
concerned
that
the
waiver
was
too
broad
and
in
both
letters
made
the
suggestion
that
the
waiver
should
be
confined
to
state
appropriated
rights
and
as
the
committee
report
755
notes,
they
considered
this
and
rejected
it,
considering
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
as
i
understand
the
legislative
history
your
honor,
it
was
a
combination
of
apparently
of
circumstances,
an
inability
in
senator
mccarran's
home
state
to
properly
administer
a
little
stream
called
the
queen
river
which
had
some
75
rights
adjudicated
out
of
it,
three
of
them
of
which
the
government
had
purchased.
there
was
the
two
pending
cases
in
the
united
states
district
court.
one
of
them
which
is
not
yet
in
judgment,
concerning
the
truckee
and
the
carson
rivers
and
the
rights
of
the
indian
for
the
recollection
project
there
which
apparently
had
involved
there.
there
was
the
fallbrook
cases
that
counsel
for
the
government
mentioned
that
were
bothering
then
senator
nixon
and
senator
nolan.
there
was
a
variety
of
these
kind
of
things,
even
the
colorado
senators
mentioned
the
problem
that
existing
in
connection
with
the
blue
river
which
was
then
pending
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
his
warning
you
might
say,
the
congress
--
the
step
that
they
were
about
to
take,
exemplifies
their
thought
that
it
covered
all
water
rights
was
not
related
to
expense
items
which
were
in
the
government
or
anything
like
that.
it
was
considered
by
the
people
who
sponsored
the
absolutely
necessary
to
bring
certainty
into
the
field
of
water
rights
in
the
west.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
you'd
have
to
have
a
district
attorney
in
every
county
in
western
united
states.
i
might
say
--
it
has
been
suggested
of
course,
well,
why
doesn't
this
court
give
the
justice
department
and
the
other
federal
agencies
time
to
make
a
list
and
put
it
somewhere?
well,
in
1952,
this
was
part
of
the
legislation
in
rejecting
and
they
have,
18
years
since
then,
the
time
this
suit
was
really
going
and
they
haven't
made
a
list
yet
until
they
were
brought
into
court.
but
when
they
were
brought
in
the
court
as
the
appendix
indicates,
they
were
able
to
detail
in
particularity
their
uses,
not
only
appropriative
but
also
reserved
uses
within
the
area
of
the
eagle
river.
i
wanted
to
touch,
if
i
might,
briefly
upon
some
11
to
12,
13
cases,
at
least
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
as
reported
decisions
that
relate
to
or
refer
to
this
particular
section
666.
counsel
has
mentioned
the
only
one
i
believe
it
is
been
this
court
for
a
direct
decision
on
it,
there
were
two
count
cases
at
the
time,
that's
in
dugan
versus
rank.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
every
time
this
court
or
the
circuit
court
for
the
ninth
circuit
or
for
practical
matter
any
other
court
has
held
that
666
did
not
confer
jurisdiction,
that
it
was
not
a
quasi
public
suit
that
was
involved.
it
was
request
for
declaratory
relief,
injunction,
sometimes
denominated
a
class
action
and
court
said
in
every
circumstance
that
is
not
what's
involved
because
it
is
not
the
quasi
public
proceeding
called
a
general
adjudication
in
western
states.
and
the
only
case
the
really
reaches
this
point
is
the
very
first
one
on
the
list
and
that's
the
in
re
green
river
case
that
judge
christensen
decided
in
utah.
and
he
thoroughly
discusses
the
legislative
history,
finds
that
it
was
intended
that
united
states
be
joined,
does
not
concern
himself
with
the
difference
in
kinds
of
rights,
but
merely
said,
go
back
to
the
state
court,
they
have
the
machinery.
i've
noted
that
sometimes
the
adjudications
in
utah,
they
go
on
for
years
and
there
is
thousands
of
people
involved
and
the
federal
court
just
doesn't
have
time
to
take
care
of
this.
this
got
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts
that
has
appropriate
machinery.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
another
point
and
it
is
this
attitude
of
the
government
today
and
the
attitude
as
changed
over
the
years
of
various
times
that
brings
i
think
monumental
confusion
for
the
other
departments
of
the
government.
they
don't
know
what
to
do.
the
four
sets
of
regulations
concerning
what
they
ought
to
do
change
time
and
again.
it
ends
up
that
if
united
states
is
not
held
into
this
action.
there
is
only
one
kind
of
right
that
must
be
barred
according
the
state
law
and
that
would
be
your
reclamation
rights
by
reason
of
section
8.
i
think
that
the
principle
problem
is
not
whether
or
not
a
reserve
right
exists,
but
if
it
does
in
fact
exist
when
--
what
occasion,
when
it
was
reserved
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
what
is
the
derivation?
i
believe
it
can
commence
with
witters
(ph)
and
progress
there
to
various
indian
reservation
matters
until
finally
culminating
in
arizona
versus
california.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no
sir,
i
don't
so
read
the
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
eagle
county
case
below?
no
sir,
i
do
not.
in
fact,
i
think
the
mr.
justice
groves
refused
to
reach
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
stockman
versus
leddy,
as
reaching
the
reserved
right
question?
that
reached
the
date
to
appropriation
question
i
believe
your
honor.
reserved
right
question
to
my
knowledge
is
not
been
reached
in
colorado.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that
whether
or
not
there's
a
reserved
right?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
subject
to
review
here
and
that's
the
right
of
the
government
if
the
colorado
courts
as
they're
afraid
will
not
follow
the
law,
but
i
submit
that
i
suggest
that
the
colorado
courts
will
follow
the
law,
both
federal
and
state
law,
without
hesitation.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that's
the
way
i
view
the
statute,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
if
i
as
opening
proceeding
i
have
not,
no,
sir.
in
fact,
as
i
would
give
recognition
to
them,
i'll
only
inquire
as
to
what
is
the
quantity
and
what
is
the
date.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
just
because
you
denominated
reservation
between
bad
and
the
word
?appropriation.?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that's
correct.
i
think
that
united
states
would
be
entitled
to
the
extent
of
a
can
show
what's
right
to
whatever
date
it
was
that
they
said
this
water
is
ours.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
might
be
subordinate
to
some
that
came
into
existence,
ahead
of
those
rights
of
united
states
(voice
overlaps)
to
the
other.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
what
i'm
trying
to
say
your
honor
is
that
i
recognize
united
states
does
have
appropriate
rights
under
state
law
and
likewise
has
appropriative
rights
under
federal
law,
they
chose
to
call
it
reserved
rights
under
the
federal
law.
those
are
all
implied,
they
have
to
be
found,
those
letter.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
do
i
agree
with
it?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
the
fact
system
quantity
but
i
certainly
agree
with
the
theory
that
was
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
i
do.
i
don't
think
i
have
very
much
choice
in
that
regard
in
any
[attempt
to
laughter]
event.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
we
agree
with
that
whole
heartedly
your
honor,
we
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
unquestionably,
if
the
indian
reservation
will
say
or
the
forest
was
withdrawn
in
1900
and
there
were
a
variety
water
rights
acquired
prior
thereto
they
would
be
a
likewise
entitled
to
their
priority
date,
that
is
the
appropriation
system.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
it
can't
go
back
when
they
came
into
existence
your
honor.
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
don't
believe
so.
no,
i
don't
mean
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no,
because
the
government's
claim
in
1905
here
not
1877.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
agree
with
the
position
the
government
takes
that
they're
entitled
to
show
their
date
and
go
back
to
it,
unquestionably
and
to
the
extent
that
this
takes
out
other
appropriate
rights,
i
guess
that's
just
one
of
the
ways
the
game
is
play
but
that's
the
purpose
of
the
system.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
i
can
answer
the
question
this
way
your
honor
is
that
about
1897,
i
believe
that
the
organic
act
setup
the
forests
and
largely,
they
were
timber
reserves
and
there
were
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
timber.
now,
i
would
say
in
that
original
withdraw,
this
was
the
purpose
for
which
the
water
was
drawn
and
whatever
the
united
states
could
show
it
needed
for
this
purpose
it's
be
entitled
to
reserve.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
in
1960,
i
believe
it
was
the
act
concerning
multiple
use
of
federal
land
went
in
when
they
dumped
all
these
other
things
and
on
top
of
it
as
a
purpose
for
the
forest.
and
it
might
be
the
court
would
--
a
court
would
hold
that
as
to
some
of
these
rights
that
the
united
states
claims
they
would
have
to
come
and
clear
up
to
1960.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no
what
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
can't
certainly
understand
that
some
of
them
would
be
so
de
minimis
that
there
would
no
point
wasting
time,
but
the
government
is
in
a
better
position
to
say
then
we
what's
that
going
to
be,
that's
the
problem.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
they
do
your
honor,
they
were
perfectly
able
to
list
in
the
eagle
county.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
were
able
to
that
there
also,
they
spoke
of
their
general
reserved
rights
and
then
spoke
of
these
things
that
they
were
going
to
claim
specifically
which
as
i
view
it,
is
a
double
claim
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
sir?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
have
not
offered
them
for
adjudication
and
that's
all
we
ask
them
to
do
and
all
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
direct
them
to
do
so.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
direct
the
government
to
offer
its
claims
for
adjudication
and
as
is
indicated
if
the
colorado
courts,
the
utah
courts,
the
washington
courts
go
straight
as
court
is
doing
here
is
to
straighten
that
problem
out.
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
state
courts
are
not
going
to
follow
federal
law
when
they
are
specifically
enjoined
to
follow.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
there
is.
as
matter
as
i
view
its
appearance
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong.
is
it
wrong
to
allow
the
government
standout
here
with
this
open
ended
mortgage
or
is
it
right
to
make
them
bring
that
open
ended
mortgage
into
court
and
declare
their
rights,
i
should
say
equitable
way
to
proceed
as
i
view.
i
might
mention,
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
that
there
is
a
--
i
would
have
an
opportunity
of
course
after
mr.
kiechel
speaks
concerning
a-12,
but
there
is
an
amazing
similarity
between
these
cases
and
i
think
that
the
result
probably
should
be
the
same.
thank
you.
