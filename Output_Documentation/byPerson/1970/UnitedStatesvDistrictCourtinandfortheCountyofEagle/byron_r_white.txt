justice
byron
r.
white
what's
wrong
with
this
particular
proceeding
under
that
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
because
it
concerns
only
the
eagle
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
eagle
river
was
a
river
system,
but
you
don't
think
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
even
with
respect
to
the
eagle
river,
do
you
think
this
is
not
a
general
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
put
aside
reserved
rights.
let's
just
talk
about
united
states'
appropriative
rights
in
the
eagle
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
still
take
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
appropriative
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
put
aside
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
pretty
well
makes
a
shambles
out
of
the
whole
statute,
doesn't
it
in
terms
of
consent?
can
you
imagine
one
that
--
where
at
the
outside
you
could
guarantee
that
every
single
party
known
the
man
can't
quite
possibly
be
there?
if
they
miss
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
going
also
to
argue
that
i
suppose
that
this
isn't
a
general
adjudication
because
the
eagle
river
is
just
a
tributary?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
qualify
under
the
statute,
you
have
to
have
the
entire
colorado
river
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
all
people
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
and
all
of
people
in
the
eastern
slope
were
taking
it
out
to
colorado?
justice
byron
r.
white
specially,
if
somebody
is
claiming
at
earlier
date
that
to
have
all
them
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
some
state
comes
along
and
attempts
to
perhaps
modernize
the
statutes
and
its
adjudications
to
make
some
sense
out
of
them.
don't
you
think
congress'
consent
is
to
end,
it's
consent
for
one
single
type
of
adjudication
and
that's
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
present
colorado
system
is
unconstitutional,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
united
states
claiming
water
under
state
law
appropriative
rights
and
wants
to
assert
those
rights,
you
nevertheless
say
that
the
united
states
can
just
sit
back
and
use
the
water
and
until
and
unless
it
wants
to
go
into
a
court
and
establish
those
rights
there
is
nothing
anybody
can
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
how
about
my
question
--
how
about
my
question,
does
that
really
mean
that
united
states
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
suggesting
defiance.
i'm
just
saying
that
until
unless
you
want
to
go
to
court
that
you
can
just
use
the
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
what
are
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
meanwhile,
the
united
states
can
just
use
the
water
that
it's
appropriated
without
anything
more
until
and
unless
that
colorado
brings
--
institutes
a
proceeding
qualifying,
under
your
view
statute
of
the
united
states
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
united
states
know
what
its
claims
are,
its
appropriate
claims
are
under
state
law?
i
suppose
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
idea
what
reserved
rights
you're
claiming?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
reserved
claims
mean
whatever
you
may
need
in
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
that
would
be
as
far
you
could
go
in
quantifying
your
reserved
right
to
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
alright,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
does
the
united
states
--
if
you
win
this
case,
when
would
the
--
how
would
the
united
states
plan
to
establish
their
reserved
right
just
by
--
would
you
bring
some
proceeding
to
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
just
be
by
administrative
action,
you
wouldn't
ever
anticipates
subjecting
or
submitting
those
quantifications
to
a
court,
if
you
could
help
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
bit
you
would
never
anticipate
either
yourself
taking
these
claims
to
court
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
colorado
specially,
in
this
district
specifically
you
would
have
no
plans
to
participate
a
judicial
proceeding
to
clarify
the
amount
of
your
reserved
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
administrative?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
in
your
position
--
from
your
standpoint
that
was
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
your
view
is
that
that
decree
--
that
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
your
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
court
did
take
--
did
recognize
your
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
your
position
here
that
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
reach
reserved
rights
even
if
you
consent
it
because
you
have
no
power
to
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
we're
required
to
(inaudible)
be
helpful.
all
we
have
to
say
yes
there
were
reserved
rights
and
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
--
the
issue
here
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
specifically
to
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
(inaudible)
is
that
reserved
right
is
out
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
worry
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
general
adjudication
prior
to
this
proceeding
on
eagle
river
or
water
district
37?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
and
has
the
united
states
been
a
party
to
any
of
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
had
appropriative
rights
surely
before
this
supplemental
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
--
why
wouldn't
they
have
been
enjoined
in
some
of
the
supplementals?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
after
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
how
about
appropriative
rights?
apparently,
there
have
been
never
been
any
adjudication
of
the
appropriative
rights
of
the
united
states
in
water
district
37?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
there
have
been
some
adjudications
since
1952
in
the
state
courts,
why
wasn't
the
united
states
joined
in
those
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
in
a
supplemental
proceeding
after
1952
brought
some
person
to
establish
his
right
which
i
take
it
is
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
people
--
other
people
--
people
who
weren't
served
are
not
bound
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
if
you
win
this
case
would
the
united
states
be
bound
by
all
of
the
supplemental
adjudications
since
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
derivation
of
the
reserved
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
colorado
supreme
court
has
said
there
isn't
such
thing
as
reserved
right,
isn't
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
so
read
the
prior
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
a
prior
case
in
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
which
your
colleague
here
referred
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
idea
would
be
that
the
reserved
right
question
is
whether
every
thing
else
should
be
submitted
in
the
proceeding
like
is
now
before
the
court
and
that
it
should
go
up
through
the
state
courts
and
you
agree
that's
a
federal
question,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
subject
to
review
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
your
pleadings
in
this
case
or
take
the
position
or
have
your
clients
take
the
position
that
united
states
has
no
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they're
subject
to
date,
do
you
think
they're
subject
to
the
colorado
appropriation
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
there's
really
any
reserved
right
then,
any
different
from
appropriative
uses?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
be
subordinate
to
some
other
rights,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
united
states
either
has
appropriative
rights
under
colorado
law
or
does
it
and
the
reserved
rights
you
know
many
other
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
reserved
rights
can
override
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
government's
claim
is
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
do
you
say
that
when
a
government
sets
aside
a
national
forest
or
something
else
or
a
new
indian
reservation
that
its
appropriative
right
is
limited
by
what
it
actually
is
using
then
or
can
the
right
expand
as
the
need
expands
in
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
reserved
right
you
are
booked
with
--
have
no
open
end?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
open
end
--
wouldn't
be
open
end
to
cover
future
need
except
to
the
extent
was
water
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
wrong
with
this
particular
proceeding
under
that
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
because
it
concerns
only
the
eagle
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
eagle
river
was
a
river
system,
but
you
don't
think
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
even
with
respect
to
the
eagle
river,
do
you
think
this
is
not
a
general
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
put
aside
reserved
rights.
let's
just
talk
about
united
states'
appropriative
rights
in
the
eagle
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
still
take
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
appropriative
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
put
aside
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
pretty
well
makes
a
shambles
out
of
the
whole
statute,
doesn't
it
in
terms
of
consent?
can
you
imagine
one
that
--
where
at
the
outside
you
could
guarantee
that
every
single
party
known
the
man
can't
quite
possibly
be
there?
if
they
miss
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
going
also
to
argue
that
i
suppose
that
this
isn't
a
general
adjudication
because
the
eagle
river
is
just
a
tributary?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
qualify
under
the
statute,
you
have
to
have
the
entire
colorado
river
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
all
people
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
and
all
of
people
in
the
eastern
slope
were
taking
it
out
to
colorado?
justice
byron
r.
white
specially,
if
somebody
is
claiming
at
earlier
date
that
to
have
all
them
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
some
state
comes
along
and
attempts
to
perhaps
modernize
the
statutes
and
its
adjudications
to
make
some
sense
out
of
them.
don't
you
think
congress'
consent
is
to
end,
it's
consent
for
one
single
type
of
adjudication
and
that's
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
present
colorado
system
is
unconstitutional,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
united
states
claiming
water
under
state
law
appropriative
rights
and
wants
to
assert
those
rights,
you
nevertheless
say
that
the
united
states
can
just
sit
back
and
use
the
water
and
until
and
unless
it
wants
to
go
into
a
court
and
establish
those
rights
there
is
nothing
anybody
can
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
how
about
my
question
--
how
about
my
question,
does
that
really
mean
that
united
states
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
suggesting
defiance.
i'm
just
saying
that
until
unless
you
want
to
go
to
court
that
you
can
just
use
the
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
what
are
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
meanwhile,
the
united
states
can
just
use
the
water
that
it's
appropriated
without
anything
more
until
and
unless
that
colorado
brings
--
institutes
a
proceeding
qualifying,
under
your
view
statute
of
the
united
states
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
united
states
know
what
its
claims
are,
its
appropriate
claims
are
under
state
law?
i
suppose
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
idea
what
reserved
rights
you're
claiming?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
reserved
claims
mean
whatever
you
may
need
in
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
that
would
be
as
far
you
could
go
in
quantifying
your
reserved
right
to
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
alright,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
does
the
united
states
--
if
you
win
this
case,
when
would
the
--
how
would
the
united
states
plan
to
establish
their
reserved
right
just
by
--
would
you
bring
some
proceeding
to
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
just
be
by
administrative
action,
you
wouldn't
ever
anticipates
subjecting
or
submitting
those
quantifications
to
a
court,
if
you
could
help
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
bit
you
would
never
anticipate
either
yourself
taking
these
claims
to
court
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
colorado
specially,
in
this
district
specifically
you
would
have
no
plans
to
participate
a
judicial
proceeding
to
clarify
the
amount
of
your
reserved
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
administrative?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
in
your
position
--
from
your
standpoint
that
was
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
your
view
is
that
that
decree
--
that
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
your
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
court
did
take
--
did
recognize
your
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
your
position
here
that
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
reach
reserved
rights
even
if
you
consent
it
because
you
have
no
power
to
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
we're
required
to
(inaudible)
be
helpful.
all
we
have
to
say
yes
there
were
reserved
rights
and
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
--
the
issue
here
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
specifically
to
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
(inaudible)
is
that
reserved
right
is
out
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
worry
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
general
adjudication
prior
to
this
proceeding
on
eagle
river
or
water
district
37?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
and
has
the
united
states
been
a
party
to
any
of
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
had
appropriative
rights
surely
before
this
supplemental
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
--
why
wouldn't
they
have
been
enjoined
in
some
of
the
supplementals?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
after
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
how
about
appropriative
rights?
apparently,
there
have
been
never
been
any
adjudication
of
the
appropriative
rights
of
the
united
states
in
water
district
37?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
there
have
been
some
adjudications
since
1952
in
the
state
courts,
why
wasn't
the
united
states
joined
in
those
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
in
a
supplemental
proceeding
after
1952
brought
some
person
to
establish
his
right
which
i
take
it
is
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
people
--
other
people
--
people
who
weren't
served
are
not
bound
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
if
you
win
this
case
would
the
united
states
be
bound
by
all
of
the
supplemental
adjudications
since
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
derivation
of
the
reserved
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
colorado
supreme
court
has
said
there
isn't
such
thing
as
reserved
right,
isn't
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
so
read
the
prior
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
a
prior
case
in
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
which
your
colleague
here
referred
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
idea
would
be
that
the
reserved
right
question
is
whether
every
thing
else
should
be
submitted
in
the
proceeding
like
is
now
before
the
court
and
that
it
should
go
up
through
the
state
courts
and
you
agree
that's
a
federal
question,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
subject
to
review
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
your
pleadings
in
this
case
or
take
the
position
or
have
your
clients
take
the
position
that
united
states
has
no
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they're
subject
to
date,
do
you
think
they're
subject
to
the
colorado
appropriation
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
there's
really
any
reserved
right
then,
any
different
from
appropriative
uses?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
be
subordinate
to
some
other
rights,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
united
states
either
has
appropriative
rights
under
colorado
law
or
does
it
and
the
reserved
rights
you
know
many
other
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
reserved
rights
can
override
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
government's
claim
is
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
do
you
say
that
when
a
government
sets
aside
a
national
forest
or
something
else
or
a
new
indian
reservation
that
its
appropriative
right
is
limited
by
what
it
actually
is
using
then
or
can
the
right
expand
as
the
need
expands
in
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
reserved
right
you
are
booked
with
--
have
no
open
end?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
open
end
--
wouldn't
be
open
end
to
cover
future
need
except
to
the
extent
was
water
available?
