justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
a
condition
for
eligibility
that
it
works?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
when
--
would
you
just
indicate
briefly,
specifically
how
a
home
visit
contributes
to
determining
eligibility
based
on
those
few
factors
which
determine
eligibility,
not
some
peripheral
matters
that
might
be
able
to
--
that
might
interest
the
social
worker?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what's
that
got
to
do
with
eligibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
the
home
visit
contribute
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
that's
what
i
don't
understand
a
home
visit,
do
you
want
to
see
if
the
aid
is
being
used
for
the
child,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
tell
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
child
isn't
receiving
adequate
care
in
your
judgment,
does
that
terminate
eligibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
does
it
just
provides
some
ground
for
taking
some
action
under
some
other
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
new
york
provided
--
if
the
law
provided
that
there
would
be
a
crime
bar
the
case
worker?
you
don't
report
to
give
this
caseworker
the
authority
to
header
against
anybody's
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
make
any
difference
if
new
york
law
did
purport
to
give
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
really
saying,
what's
your
theory
of
really
that
your
conditioning
aid
on
the
ability
in
respect
of
the
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
and
that
without
a
home
visits,
the
information
is
furnished?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
only
alternative
to
the
home
visit
that
was
offered
here
was
a
testimony
of
the
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
--
tell
me
is
it
your
--
is
it
your
suggestion
that
the
welfare
department
must
be
and
is
required
to
take
the
client's
word
for
certain
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
someone
wants
to
verify
that
the
children
are
actually
living
in
a
home
rather
than
with
relatives
and
the
mother
says,
well,
they
are
living
in
the
house
and
the
welfare
department
says
they
would
like
to
go
and
check
and
make
sure.
your
contention
is
that
they
may
not
do
that
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
answer
is
yes,
you
would
say
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
say
that
the
state
just
isn't
entitled
to
make
a
home
visit
to
verify
what
the
mother
has
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
get
a
warrant
because
there
is
no
probable
cause
and
be
--
and
you
can't
go
in
without
a
warrant,
because
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
issue
seems
to
be
then
whether
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
verify
eligibility
information
by
home
visits?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
weiss,
suppose
she
applies
for
some
kind
of
categorical
aid
like
the
hot
water
heater
is
gone
out,
we
need
a
new
hot
water
heater
and
they
said,
well,
we'll
be
glad
to
give
you
one,
we
just
have
to
come
and
make
sure
it's
broken
and
see
how
big
it
is,
and
how
much
it's
going
to
cost,
and
the
things
like
that.
she
says,
sorry,
just
give
me
the
heater,
but
don't
come
in
the
house
and
here
is
the
same
answer,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
of
course
as
long
as
the
--
no
one
will
ever
have
any
idea
that
she
was
lying?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
usually
don't
get
money
every
month
when
you
fill
out
the
forms.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
either
a
statute
or
a
regulation
require
a
home
visit
regularly?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
policy
of
new
york
as
stated
in
the
statute
or
in
the
regulation,
does
not
--
is
in
fact
that
there
must
be
a
home
visit
in
order
to
assure
the
welfare
department
of
continued
eligibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
must
think
that
there
is
some
other
ways
of
doing
it
or
that
they
just
don't
care
actually.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
that
means
whatever,
worked
in
verifying
just
the
fact
that
three
children
are
living
in
the
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
a
condition
for
eligibility
that
it
works?

how
