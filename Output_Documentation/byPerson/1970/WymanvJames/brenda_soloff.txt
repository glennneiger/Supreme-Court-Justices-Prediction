ms.
brenda
soloff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
ability
of
the
agency
which
is
charged
with
administering
a
local
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program
to
verify
information
which
an
applicant
or
a
recipient
is
concededly
obliged
to
furnish
for
eligibility
purposes
and
to
verify
it
as
meaningfully
as
possible
by
a
visit
to
the
home
by
an
agency
caseworker.
or
put
another
way,
the
question
is
whether
the
adult
afdc
client
has
an
absolute
right
to
refuse
access
to
her
home
and
still
receive
assistance,
no
matter
what
her
conceded
obligations
maybe,
and
even
if
a
refusal
is
entirely
arbitrary.
essentially,
we
submit
that
since
afdc
assistance
is
premised
on
the
care
of
children
in
homes
which
would
otherwise
be
unable
to
provide
for
them,
that
the
request
for
access
to
the
home
is
a
reasonable
one.
in
addition,
since
that
request
is
denied
the
result
is
neither
entry
nor
a
contempt
proceeding
nor
automatic
termination
of
benefits,
but
a
hearing.
the
home
visit
apparatus
does
not
infringe
any
fourth
amendment
right.
no
warrant
procedures
required
to
validate
the
home
visit,
nor
could
any
such
procedure
more
fully
protect
the
afdc
client
against
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
the
party
than
the
one
that
we
have
now.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
was
given
in
this
case,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
a
policy
in
new
york
city
that
it
be
given.
the
affidavits
do
indicate
that
it
was
not
given
in
those
cases.
i
would
think
that,
that
could
be
an
issue
which
could
be
resolved
at
a
hearing
which
is
held.
ms.
brenda
soloff
in
this
case,
there
definitely
was
advance
notice
for
approximately
a
week.
the
adult
appellee
in
this
case
barbara
james
first
applied
for
assistance
in
april
1967,
pursuant
to
the
state
regulation,
requiring
that
a
home
visit
be
made
to
initial
applicants
for
assistance,
such
a
visit
was
made,
the
apartment
was
seen
and
various
aspects
of
eligibility
were
discussed.
the
worker
was
not
then
or
afterward
persuaded
the
appellee's
eligibility,
but
recommended
that
the
case
be
open
because
of
the
imminent
birth
of
her
child.
thereafter,
there
were
regular,
periodical
contacts
with
appellee,
also
as
required
by
regulation.
these
contacts
took
the
form
of
additional
home
visits
to
attempt
to
verify
eligibility
and
to
attempt
to
deal
with
appellee's
many
demands,
the
greater
number
of
which
were
seem
to
be
invalid.
during
these
visits,
no
worker
went
behind
close
doors
or
poked
or
probed
into
any
closed
area
and
at
each
visit
the
child
was
seen.
ultimately,
she
notified
a
caseworker
who
had
sought
to
make
an
appointment
by
letter
a
week
in
advance
that
under
no
circumstances
and
at
no
time
would
the
worker
be
admitted
to
the
home.
on
may
27,
1969
before
any
termination
of
benefits,
a
hearing
was
held
by
the
department
at
which
appellee
and
counsel
were
present
and
at
which
counsel
represented
that
although
his
client
would
talk
anywhere,
she
would
not
talk
at
home
because
that
would
violate
her
right
of
privacy.
the
referee
found
that
refusal
to
comply
with
the
policy
of
contact
by
home
visit
justified
the
case
--
closing
the
case,
pointing
out
and
i
quote
from
his
opinion,
“the
home
visit
which
mrs.
james
refuses
to
permit
is
for
the
purpose
of
determining
if
there
are
any
changes
in
her
situation
that
might
effect
her
eligibility
to
continue
to
receive
public
assistance
or
that
might
affect
the
amount
of
such
assistance
and
to
see
if
there
are
any
social
services
which
the
department
of
social
services
can
provide
to
the
family.”
he,
therefore,
affirmed
the
decision
to
close
the
case.
appellee
did
not
proceed
as
she
could
have
to
a
state
fair
hearing.
instead
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
termination
of
benefits
for
refusal
to
consent
to
a
home
visit
without
a
warrant.
a
statutory
three-judged
court
was
convened
and
its
majority
opinion,
the
court
held
that
a
home
visit
without
a
warrant
is
an
invasion
of
the
constitutionally
protected
right
of
privacy.
that
alternative
methods
are
available
to
verify
eligibility
and
that
should
a
home
visit
be
deemed
required
to
consider
a
certain
aspect
of
eligibility
and
the
applicant
or
recipient
refuses
to
allow
the
visit,
a
suitably
restricted
search
warrant
may
issue
to
force
the
client
to
disclose
the
terms
of
his
eligibility.
the
majority
rejected
any
idea
that
the
home
visit
could
legitimately
ascertain
the
wellbeing
of
the
child,
although
i
think
somewhat
inconsistently
it
also
provided
in
its
alternative
possibilities
for
verification
of
the
wellbeing
of
the
child.
the
first
point
to
be
made,
i
think,
is
that
the
home
visit
as
presently
structured
is
a
reasonable
and
necessary
investigative
tool
in
afdc
cases.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
serves
valid
purposes,
it
provides
information
on
a
need
for
and
the
extent
of
assistance,
and
it
provides
information
on
the
extent
to
which
the
assistance
is
being
used
for
and
is
working
for
the
only
purpose
of
the
program,
that
is
the
care
children
in
their
homes
and
in
this
connection
it
also
serves
to
identify
immediate
areas
of
service.
it
is
conceded
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
an
hew
--
if
you
mean
mr.
justice,
is
there
a
regulation
specifically
requiring
home
visits,
there
is
only
for
a
quality
control
sample
of
cases,
but
there
is
such
a
requirement
for
an
investigation
of
a
selected
sample
and
i
think,
it's
important
to
note
in
this
context
that
the
appellees
apparently
don't
challenge
the
fact
that
you
can
make
home
visits
to
this
selected
sample.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
not
that
i
know
of
specifically
designated
in
the
regulation,
but
each
household
is
a
potential
member
of
that
sample
and
it
seems
to
me
that
constitutionality
doesn't
rest
on
a
number
of
homes
that
you
include
in
the
sample.
if
the
sample
proves
inadequate,
you
must
increase
it.
and
in
this
case,
what's
essentially
happened
is
that
it's
increased
to
a
100%,
but
there
is
that
core
of
sample
cases
and
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
am
not
completely
familiar
with
the
mechanics
of
how
these
--
a
sample
is
selected,
but
i
do
know
that
each
state
is
required
to
furnish
a
sample
that
will
be
adequate
at
least
for
hew
purposes,
will
be
deemed
to
be
adequate
to
determine
if
in
fact
eligibility
requirements
are
being
met.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
there
is
no
constitutional
significance
to
it
mr.
justice,
as
far
as
whether
or
not
there
is
a
significance
in
the
fact
that
they
may
deemed
this
adequate.
this
is
a
policy
question,
they
may
or
may
not.
the
states
are
free
unless
there
is
a
specific
proscription
to
provide
for
such
testing
of
eligibility
as
they
deem
appropriate
in
their
own
programs
and
new
york,
of
course,
has
just
about
the
most
extensive,
i
think,
it
does
have
most
extensive
afdc
program
in
the
country
and
it
presents
a
great
number
of
problems
which
the
state
is
just
trying
to
cope
within
this
fashion
and
nothing
in
hew
regulations
proscribes
this.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
--
i
think
you
cannot
strictly
say
that
the
regulation
which
says
that
you
must
do
so
much
says
that
you
can
do
no
more.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
provide
statistics
to
hew,
based
on
selected
sample
of
cases.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
prepare
reports
for
hew.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
no.
a
sample,
a
full
field
investigation
of
eligibility
including
a
home
visit.
this
is
seen
--
i
am
more
familiar
with
what's
happening
now
in
the
simplified
declaration
experiment
which
is
presently
going
around
--
being
tried
out
around
the
country.
in
that
case
each
state
was
required
to
set
up
districts
or
experimental
districts
within
the
state,
not
the
entire
state.
to
try
to
see
if
eligibility
could
be
determined
on
a
simple
affidavit
process.
to
check
that,
a
home
visit
was
required
as
part
of
a
full
field
investigation
again
in
a
selected
sample
of
cases
and
the
results
that
have
come
in
from
that
so
far
are
inconclusive.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
eligibility
and
continued
eligibility
in
a
full
sense.
that
is,
that
the
person
is
in
need
and
that
would
respect
to
continued
eligibility
that
the
assistance
which
is
being
given
works
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
and
if
it
doesn't
work
then
that
is
an
aspect
of
eligibility
for
the
program.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
home
visit
can
verify
of
course
first
the
residence.
it
can
verify
the
number
of
people
in
the
family.
it
can
assess
management,
both
past
management
for
eligibility
purposes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
has
to
do
with
the
possibility
of
resources
and
this
is
in
terms
on
initial
eligibility
i
am
speaking
now.
it
has
to
do
with
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
undisclosed
resources.
ms.
brenda
soloff
by
seeing
what
is
in
the
home,
the
worker
maybe
able
to
have
an
idea
of
whether
or
not
the
conditions
which
the
claimant
--
which
the
client
has
stated
exists,
do
in
fact
exist.
and
in
terms
of
the
functioning
of
the
household
in
relation
to
the
child
a
home
visit
can
tell
more
than
an
office
visit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
you
can
tell
by
the
functioning,
the
relationship
of
the
child
to
the
home
whether
there
are
adequate
facilities
for
the
child
in
the
home,
whether
the
child
is
receiving
the
kind
of
care
which
does
now
or
may
create
a
dangerous
situation
which
must
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
under
the
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
but
the
ground
--
if
the
ground
--
the
ultimate
result
is
a
neglect
proceeding
which
the
statute
specifically
provides,
the
federal
social
security
act
provides
must
be
done
if
there
is
a
danger
to
the
child.
that
would
in
effect
terminate
eligibility.
it
maybe
that
services
will
have
to
be,
mandatory
services
will
have
to
be
provided
for
the
child
to
keep
the
child
in
the
home.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
your
honor,
mr.
justice,
it
means
that
steps
must
be
taken
to
protect
the
child
even
if
it
means
either
introducing
another
person
into
the
home
to
care
for
the
child
or
removing
the
child
from
the
home.
but
these
are,
this
is
a
purpose
of
the
program.
it's
a
statutory
congressional
policy
that
not
only
the
technical
criteria
of
eligibility,
but
the
home
conditions
of
the
child
are
relevant
to
maintaining
the
child
in
that
program.
if
the
child
cannot
be
maintained
in
their
home
then
he
must
either
be
removes
or
steps
taken
to
improve
the
home,
but
that's
as
important
an
aspect
of
the
program
as
the
other.
we
are
aiming
at
the
child,
and
seeing
the
home
in
this
respect
is
as
important
as
the
technical
eligibility
factors.
in
my
reply
brief
in
this
court,
i
cited
two
instances
which
i
think
illustrate
--
one
illustrates
one
of
these
factors
and
the
other
illustrates
the
other.
the
first
one
referred
to
was
an
example
from
the
selected
sample
in
the
declaration
system
and
it
was
a
woman
who
had
applied
for
assistance
and
been
accepted
for
assistance
on
the
ground
that
her
husband
had
deserted
her
and
assistance
was
given.
however,
a
spot
check
was
made
and
the
worker
discovered
the
husband
in
the
home.
it
was
quite
as
simple
as
that.
the
result
of
that
was
a
support
hearing,
a
payment
of
rent
arrears,
a
reference
to
a
marriage
counselor,
but
an
ineligible
family
was
not
put
on
the
rolls
and
that
was
purely
technical
eligibility
factor.
the
other
case
was
far
more
drastic
in
what
happened
and
far
less
precise
in
what
the
worker
could
determine.
this
was
a
recertification
visit
under
new
york
law
and
in
non-experimental
area,
under
the
present
system,
and
the
worker
walked
into
the
home
and
knew
that
the
family
consisted
of
the
mother
and
three
children.
and
she
walked
into
the
home
and
she
saw
the
mother
and
the
oldest
child
and
not
the
other
two
children
and
the
home
atmosphere
quite
simply
disturbed
her.
she
was
told
that
one
child
was
with
his
maternal
grandparents
and
that
the
other
child
was
with
some
neighbor,
but
she
wasn't
sure
which
and
that's
all
she
did.
but
she
was
disturbed
and
she
went
back
to
her
center
and
she
called
the
maternal
grandparents
and
they
had
not
heard,
they
did
not
have
the
infant
and
they
were
not
aware
of
where
the
infant
was.
the
maternal
grandparents
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
maternal
grandparents
who
apparently
were
more
aware
of
the
disturbed
nature
of
the
mother
than
the
other,
than
even
the
center,
went
immediately
to
the
home.
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
younger
two
children
in
fact
were
dead
and
that
the
oldest
child
was
brought
into
the
center.
but
there
was
no
precise
element
in
that
home
for
which
you
could
a
warrant
or
on
which
you
could
base
any
kind
of
determination
and
yet
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
agency
which
must
provide
for
the
care
children
in
the
home
only
so
long
as
they
can
be
cared
for
in
the
home,
to
find
out
what
happened
to
those
children
and
that
was
the
way
they
did
it.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
administrative
steps
are
established
by
regulation
mr.
justice
that
a
visit
must
be
made.
well,
a
contact
is
supposed
to
be
made
in
afdc
cases
every
three
months.
this
had
been
--
it
had
been
the
policy
to
make
the
visit
every
three
months
and
this
would
be
on
a
regular
schedule
devised
by
the
center
itself
which
was
sending
out
the
case
workers.
the
case
loads
have
made
every
three
months
impossible
in
new
york
city
and
it
has
been
reduced
to
every
six
months
at
this
point.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
have
no
authority
to
make
a
recertification
visit
for
that
purpose.
i
think
that
eligibility
itself,
technical
eligibility
is
only
in
those
set
slot
periods.
now
there
maybe
instances,
there
are
in
mrs.
james
case
where
home
visits
were
made
other
than
recertification
times,
but
in
those
instances
it
was
basically
two
verify
information
at
the
request
of
the
client.
certainly,
at
the
request
of
the
client
it
can
be
made
and
i
think
that
the
agency
would
have
discretion
where
factors
warranted
to
make
a
visit
outside
of
the
certification
period.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
district
court
did
make
some
suggestions.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
the
suggestions
for
the
warrant
the
district
court
made
which
are
no
other
alternative
available,
limited
to
a
specific
element
which
you
may
not
be
able
to
find
out
about
until
you
make
the
home
visit.
this
is
particularly
true
with
preschool
children
to
whom
there
is
otherwise
no
access
until
something
happens
to
them.
it's
simply
unworkable
and
it
would
require
on
an
individualized
case
basis
who
would
have
to
setup
the
kind
of
body
of
case
law
that
we
have
now
for
criminal
fourth
amendment
cases.
i
think
one
of
the
crucial
distinction
is
between
the
camara
decision
of
this
court
and
the
reliance
placed
on
it
by
the
district
court
is
just
this
distinction,
because
what
the
district
court
does
in
mandating
a
warrant
procedure
is
to
restructure
the
home
visit,
to
make
it
no
longer
reasonable,
to
make
it
on
a
periodic
basis
and
yet
it
clearly
is
and
it
is
related
so
closely
to
valid
purposes
that
it
clearly
is
reasonable.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
there
are
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
citations
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
they
are
not
in
the
appendix,
but
they
are
i
believe
in
the
record.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
regulations
preclude
a
visit
without
consent
that
is
it
may
not
be
a
forced
admission.
there
may
not
be
a
looking
into
closets
or
into
any
closed
area.
it
may
not
be
made
outside
of
normal
working
hours.
in
fact,
mrs.
james
in
this
case
proscribed
areas
such
as
the
bedroom,
when
she
said,
you
may
not
--
the
door
was
closed.
she
said,
you
may
not
enter;
the
worker
did
not
enter.
so
that
it
really
is
carefully
limited
by
federal
and
state
regulation
and
if
there
is
any
abuse
of
it,
of
course,
it
can
be
resolved
at
a
hearing
before
benefits
are
ever
terminated.
ms.
brenda
soloff
as
far
as
i
know
mr.
justice,
they
do.
mrs.
james
certainly
did.
she
was
not
at
least
bit
intimidated.
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
during
the
home
visit.
she
had
a
lawyer
after,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
how
much
prior
to
that
she
had
a
lawyer,
i
don't
know,
but
this
was
her
attitude
from
the
beginning
and
it
was
perfectly
proper.
ms.
brenda
soloff
mr.
justice,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
the
average
recipient
knows
the
regulations.
he
was
informed
at
the
time
when
his
application
is
taken
of
investigative
procedures.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
would
not
think
that
he
is
told
that,
but
i
would
also
not
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think,
no.
i
think
there
is
no
charge
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
is
looking
for
evidence
of
eligibility
and
of
the
wellbeing
of
the
children.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
means
whatever
he
can
establish
from
what
he
can
see
in
the
apartment
and
what
he
can
observe
of
the
workings
of
the
apartment,
the
relationship
of
the
people.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
average
warrant
would
authorize
greater
intrusion
into
more
areas
than
the
worker.
there
is
no
charge
in
any
of
these,
either
by
this
appellee
or
by
any
of
the
other
people
who
submitted
affidavits
that
that
is
their
problem
in
this
case.
none
of
them
has
ever
charged
that
kind
of
abuse
by
a
caseworker.
i
would
like
briefly
to
say
that
as
i
have
said
that
the
warrant
procedure
really
would
restructure
the
home
visit
and
that
it
is
reasonable
as
it
stands
that
the
reason
if
the
home
visit
is
to
be
allowed
as
it
presently
stands
than
the
warrant
would
serve
no
useful
purpose.
in
camara,
it
served
the
purpose
of
creating
a
relationship
between
the
client
or
the
householder
and
the
authority
which
sought
to
make
the
entry,
but
that's
not
necessary
in
this
case.
the
relationship
is
established
and
no
--
the
limitations
are
established
and
no
warrant
is
necessary
and
finally,
we
have
in
the
warrant,
pardon
me
in
the
home
visit
situation,
we
have
a
pre-termination
hearing
which
protects
against
any
arbitrary
use
of
authority
before
benefits
can
ever
be
terminated
and
this
protects
a
client
more
so
than
in
x
party
warrant
procedure
which
would
permit
invasion,
and
would
not
permit
the
client
to
state
his
side
of
the
case
and
would
not
protect
against
the
kind
of
abuse
that
is
suggested,
the
asking
of
the
relevant
questions,
looking
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
do
mr.
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
the
decision
of
this
court
basically
in
goldberg
against
kelly,
so
that
that
procedure
protects.
one
other
suggestion
is
made
that
the
warrant
is
necessary,
because
we
are
really
looking
for
signs
of
criminal
activity.
we
are
not
really
looking
for
signs
of
criminal
activity.
that
is
another
case.
it's
possible
that
it
could
be
excluded
at
a
criminal
proceeding,
it's
possible
that
it
would
be
valid
to
introduce
it
at
a
criminal
proceeding.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
know
of
no
prosecution
that's
based
on
results
of
a
home
visit
and
i
might
say
that
if
information
is
required
to
be
given
no
matter
where
it's
given
and
if
it's
false
in
a
really
--
in
a
fraudulent
sense,
then
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
given
in
the
home
or
obtained
for
the
home
or
if
it's
given
in
the
office.
the
same
result
can
follow
and
the
result
would
be
too
broad
for
a
reasonable
administrative
purpose.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
correct
mr.
justice.
it
has
been
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
at
all
mr.
justice,
it
does
not.
we
have
not
denied
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
relevant
aspect
of
this
case,
but
it's
the
right
of
privacy
and
not
the
traditional,
criminal
search.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no
we
do
not,
we
deny
in
that
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
then
you
come
much
closer
to
the
camara
situation,
but
we
don't
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
mr.
justice,
we
are
saying
that
we
must
be
able
to
determine
eligibility
to
the
extent
that
it's
conditioned.
it's
conditioned
on
the
furnishing
of
eligibility
information.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
in
most
cases.
now,
maybe
at
this
hearing
that
it
can
be
learned
that
the
information
is
available
without
the
home
visit,
but
that
really
is
a
question
for
the
agency
and
it's
not
for
the
client
to
exercise
an
option
to
decide
how
he
is
going
to
provide
the
information.
thank
you.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
are.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
have,
yes.
the
fact
that
a
client
understands
that
this
is
an
aspect
of
a
visit
would
be,
maybe
a
factor
in
his
determining
whether
to
pursue
the
application
just
as
all
other
investigative
aspects,
maybe
a
factor
in
his
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
pursue
the
application.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
would
just
like
to
say
that,
i
would
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
first
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
am
sorry.
mr.
justice
brennan's
first
question
to
mr.
weiss
in
respect
to
what
can
happen
at
a
hearing.
it
would
appear
that
mrs.
james'
assistance
was
terminated
because
of
her
refusal,
but
in
point
of
fact
as
i
said
the
referee
did
set
out
what
the
refusal
was
supposed
to,
what
the
visit
was
supposed
to
accomplish,
and
mrs.
james
did
not
set
forth
any
reason
why
the
visit
should
not
be
made.
in
fact
her
refusal
was
completely
arbitrary.
we
don't
have
another
case
in
which
--
at
least
there
is
none
that
has
come
to
anybody's
attention
in
which,
assistance
has
been
terminated
solely
for
refusal
to
permit
visit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
say
that
we
have
no
other
case
but
this
one,
mr.
justice
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
no
reason
was
advanced
why
the
visit
should
not
be
made
and
so
that
the
flat
face
of
the
record
appears
to
support
that
the
position
whereas
it's
not
least
bit
necessary.
ms.
brenda
soloff
then
i
think
it
is
up
to
--
again
we're
talking
somewhat
in
the
dark,
that
she
did
not
go
to
a
state
fair
hearing,
but
i
think
that
the
result
would
be
up
to
the
referee
to
determine
if
the
department
was
correct
that
the
option
was
unacceptable,
that
the
alternative
was
unacceptable.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
statute
requires
an
initial
home
visit.
the
regulation,
pardon
me
the
state
regulation.
thereafter
it
requires
periodic
contact
which
maybe
by
home
visit,
office
visit,
or
another
method.
it
does
not
explicitly
require
that
in
all
cases
for
a
continuing
eligibility
there
would
be
a
home
visit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
so
that
the
referee
would
have
some
latitude
in
this
respect.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
not
that
they
don't
care,
it's
that
there
is
the
possibility,
but
that
is
alternative
means,
but
that
it's
also
possible
that
alternative
means
will
not
work.
in
fact
that
home
visit
has
been
the
traditional
means
of
verifying.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
can't
think
that
another
one
would
work
as
effectively.
i
mean
that's
the
answer,
that's
the
closest
we
can
get,
whether
or
not
the
state
would
allow
or
the
federal
government
would
permit
it
to
accept
other
evidence.
it's
not
constitutionally
required
to
do
so.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
suppose
that,
that
is
possible
mr.
justice.
what's
happening
here
is
the
welfare
programs
are
changing.
we
are
trying
to
reconcile
the
recognized
dignity
of
the
individual
with
the
need
to
have
a
workable
welfare
program.
the
home
visit
is
changing
in
this
respect
too.
it
is
being
adapted
to
the
new
programs
and
we
are
trying
to
see
if
the
new
programs
work,
and
we
simply
don't
know,
and
what
what
they
are
asking
for
that
a
declaration
system
or
something
very
closely
akin
to
it,
be
established
as
a
constitutional
variety
at
a
time
when
the
evidence
simply
is
not
in
that
works
now.
ms.
brenda
soloff
mrs.
james
says
one
child.
he
is
now,
i
guess,
about
three
years
old
and
i
do
not
have
the
figure
for
a
family
of
two
under
the
revised
standard
of
need
in
new
york
city
at
this
time.
ms.
brenda
soloff
new
york
state
case
went
separately
from
its
grants
for
other
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
new
york
pays
rent
apart
from
the
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
remember
what
her
last
--
her
last
rent
that
i
recall
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
$100
a
month,
but
i
don't
remember
precisely
because
she
has
moved
a
number
of
times.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
an
apartment,
it's
an
apartment
i
believe,
it's
three
or
four
rooms.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
it
does,
but
i
can't
cite
the
section
of
the
law
in
which
that
happens,
it
would
be
under
the
family
law,
i
think.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
do.
i
am
quite
sure
they
check
foster
homes,
they
check
the
adopted
homes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
thank
you.
ms.
brenda
soloff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
ability
of
the
agency
which
is
charged
with
administering
a
local
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program
to
verify
information
which
an
applicant
or
a
recipient
is
concededly
obliged
to
furnish
for
eligibility
purposes
and
to
verify
it
as
meaningfully
as
possible
by
a
visit
to
the
home
by
an
agency
caseworker.
or
put
another
way,
the
question
is
whether
the
adult
afdc
client
has
an
absolute
right
to
refuse
access
to
her
home
and
still
receive
assistance,
no
matter
what
her
conceded
obligations
maybe,
and
even
if
a
refusal
is
entirely
arbitrary.
essentially,
we
submit
that
since
afdc
assistance
is
premised
on
the
care
of
children
in
homes
which
would
otherwise
be
unable
to
provide
for
them,
that
the
request
for
access
to
the
home
is
a
reasonable
one.
in
addition,
since
that
request
is
denied
the
result
is
neither
entry
nor
a
contempt
proceeding
nor
automatic
termination
of
benefits,
but
a
hearing.
the
home
visit
apparatus
does
not
infringe
any
fourth
amendment
right.
no
warrant
procedures
required
to
validate
the
home
visit,
nor
could
any
such
procedure
more
fully
protect
the
afdc
client
against
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
the
party
than
the
one
that
we
have
now.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
was
given
in
this
case,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
a
policy
in
new
york
city
that
it
be
given.
the
affidavits
do
indicate
that
it
was
not
given
in
those
cases.
i
would
think
that,
that
could
be
an
issue
which
could
be
resolved
at
a
hearing
which
is
held.
ms.
brenda
soloff
in
this
case,
there
definitely
was
advance
notice
for
approximately
a
week.
the
adult
appellee
in
this
case
barbara
james
first
applied
for
assistance
in
april
1967,
pursuant
to
the
state
regulation,
requiring
that
a
home
visit
be
made
to
initial
applicants
for
assistance,
such
a
visit
was
made,
the
apartment
was
seen
and
various
aspects
of
eligibility
were
discussed.
the
worker
was
not
then
or
afterward
persuaded
the
appellee's
eligibility,
but
recommended
that
the
case
be
open
because
of
the
imminent
birth
of
her
child.
thereafter,
there
were
regular,
periodical
contacts
with
appellee,
also
as
required
by
regulation.
these
contacts
took
the
form
of
additional
home
visits
to
attempt
to
verify
eligibility
and
to
attempt
to
deal
with
appellee's
many
demands,
the
greater
number
of
which
were
seem
to
be
invalid.
during
these
visits,
no
worker
went
behind
close
doors
or
poked
or
probed
into
any
closed
area
and
at
each
visit
the
child
was
seen.
ultimately,
she
notified
a
caseworker
who
had
sought
to
make
an
appointment
by
letter
a
week
in
advance
that
under
no
circumstances
and
at
no
time
would
the
worker
be
admitted
to
the
home.
on
may
27,
1969
before
any
termination
of
benefits,
a
hearing
was
held
by
the
department
at
which
appellee
and
counsel
were
present
and
at
which
counsel
represented
that
although
his
client
would
talk
anywhere,
she
would
not
talk
at
home
because
that
would
violate
her
right
of
privacy.
the
referee
found
that
refusal
to
comply
with
the
policy
of
contact
by
home
visit
justified
the
case
--
closing
the
case,
pointing
out
and
i
quote
from
his
opinion,
“the
home
visit
which
mrs.
james
refuses
to
permit
is
for
the
purpose
of
determining
if
there
are
any
changes
in
her
situation
that
might
effect
her
eligibility
to
continue
to
receive
public
assistance
or
that
might
affect
the
amount
of
such
assistance
and
to
see
if
there
are
any
social
services
which
the
department
of
social
services
can
provide
to
the
family.”
he,
therefore,
affirmed
the
decision
to
close
the
case.
appellee
did
not
proceed
as
she
could
have
to
a
state
fair
hearing.
instead
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
termination
of
benefits
for
refusal
to
consent
to
a
home
visit
without
a
warrant.
a
statutory
three-judged
court
was
convened
and
its
majority
opinion,
the
court
held
that
a
home
visit
without
a
warrant
is
an
invasion
of
the
constitutionally
protected
right
of
privacy.
that
alternative
methods
are
available
to
verify
eligibility
and
that
should
a
home
visit
be
deemed
required
to
consider
a
certain
aspect
of
eligibility
and
the
applicant
or
recipient
refuses
to
allow
the
visit,
a
suitably
restricted
search
warrant
may
issue
to
force
the
client
to
disclose
the
terms
of
his
eligibility.
the
majority
rejected
any
idea
that
the
home
visit
could
legitimately
ascertain
the
wellbeing
of
the
child,
although
i
think
somewhat
inconsistently
it
also
provided
in
its
alternative
possibilities
for
verification
of
the
wellbeing
of
the
child.
the
first
point
to
be
made,
i
think,
is
that
the
home
visit
as
presently
structured
is
a
reasonable
and
necessary
investigative
tool
in
afdc
cases.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
serves
valid
purposes,
it
provides
information
on
a
need
for
and
the
extent
of
assistance,
and
it
provides
information
on
the
extent
to
which
the
assistance
is
being
used
for
and
is
working
for
the
only
purpose
of
the
program,
that
is
the
care
children
in
their
homes
and
in
this
connection
it
also
serves
to
identify
immediate
areas
of
service.
it
is
conceded
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
an
hew
--
if
you
mean
mr.
justice,
is
there
a
regulation
specifically
requiring
home
visits,
there
is
only
for
a
quality
control
sample
of
cases,
but
there
is
such
a
requirement
for
an
investigation
of
a
selected
sample
and
i
think,
it's
important
to
note
in
this
context
that
the
appellees
apparently
don't
challenge
the
fact
that
you
can
make
home
visits
to
this
selected
sample.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
not
that
i
know
of
specifically
designated
in
the
regulation,
but
each
household
is
a
potential
member
of
that
sample
and
it
seems
to
me
that
constitutionality
doesn't
rest
on
a
number
of
homes
that
you
include
in
the
sample.
if
the
sample
proves
inadequate,
you
must
increase
it.
and
in
this
case,
what's
essentially
happened
is
that
it's
increased
to
a
100%,
but
there
is
that
core
of
sample
cases
and
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
am
not
completely
familiar
with
the
mechanics
of
how
these
--
a
sample
is
selected,
but
i
do
know
that
each
state
is
required
to
furnish
a
sample
that
will
be
adequate
at
least
for
hew
purposes,
will
be
deemed
to
be
adequate
to
determine
if
in
fact
eligibility
requirements
are
being
met.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
there
is
no
constitutional
significance
to
it
mr.
justice,
as
far
as
whether
or
not
there
is
a
significance
in
the
fact
that
they
may
deemed
this
adequate.
this
is
a
policy
question,
they
may
or
may
not.
the
states
are
free
unless
there
is
a
specific
proscription
to
provide
for
such
testing
of
eligibility
as
they
deem
appropriate
in
their
own
programs
and
new
york,
of
course,
has
just
about
the
most
extensive,
i
think,
it
does
have
most
extensive
afdc
program
in
the
country
and
it
presents
a
great
number
of
problems
which
the
state
is
just
trying
to
cope
within
this
fashion
and
nothing
in
hew
regulations
proscribes
this.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
--
i
think
you
cannot
strictly
say
that
the
regulation
which
says
that
you
must
do
so
much
says
that
you
can
do
no
more.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
provide
statistics
to
hew,
based
on
selected
sample
of
cases.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
prepare
reports
for
hew.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
no.
a
sample,
a
full
field
investigation
of
eligibility
including
a
home
visit.
this
is
seen
--
i
am
more
familiar
with
what's
happening
now
in
the
simplified
declaration
experiment
which
is
presently
going
around
--
being
tried
out
around
the
country.
in
that
case
each
state
was
required
to
set
up
districts
or
experimental
districts
within
the
state,
not
the
entire
state.
to
try
to
see
if
eligibility
could
be
determined
on
a
simple
affidavit
process.
to
check
that,
a
home
visit
was
required
as
part
of
a
full
field
investigation
again
in
a
selected
sample
of
cases
and
the
results
that
have
come
in
from
that
so
far
are
inconclusive.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
eligibility
and
continued
eligibility
in
a
full
sense.
that
is,
that
the
person
is
in
need
and
that
would
respect
to
continued
eligibility
that
the
assistance
which
is
being
given
works
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
and
if
it
doesn't
work
then
that
is
an
aspect
of
eligibility
for
the
program.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
home
visit
can
verify
of
course
first
the
residence.
it
can
verify
the
number
of
people
in
the
family.
it
can
assess
management,
both
past
management
for
eligibility
purposes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
has
to
do
with
the
possibility
of
resources
and
this
is
in
terms
on
initial
eligibility
i
am
speaking
now.
it
has
to
do
with
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
undisclosed
resources.
ms.
brenda
soloff
by
seeing
what
is
in
the
home,
the
worker
maybe
able
to
have
an
idea
of
whether
or
not
the
conditions
which
the
claimant
--
which
the
client
has
stated
exists,
do
in
fact
exist.
and
in
terms
of
the
functioning
of
the
household
in
relation
to
the
child
a
home
visit
can
tell
more
than
an
office
visit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
you
can
tell
by
the
functioning,
the
relationship
of
the
child
to
the
home
whether
there
are
adequate
facilities
for
the
child
in
the
home,
whether
the
child
is
receiving
the
kind
of
care
which
does
now
or
may
create
a
dangerous
situation
which
must
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
under
the
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
but
the
ground
--
if
the
ground
--
the
ultimate
result
is
a
neglect
proceeding
which
the
statute
specifically
provides,
the
federal
social
security
act
provides
must
be
done
if
there
is
a
danger
to
the
child.
that
would
in
effect
terminate
eligibility.
it
maybe
that
services
will
have
to
be,
mandatory
services
will
have
to
be
provided
for
the
child
to
keep
the
child
in
the
home.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
your
honor,
mr.
justice,
it
means
that
steps
must
be
taken
to
protect
the
child
even
if
it
means
either
introducing
another
person
into
the
home
to
care
for
the
child
or
removing
the
child
from
the
home.
but
these
are,
this
is
a
purpose
of
the
program.
it's
a
statutory
congressional
policy
that
not
only
the
technical
criteria
of
eligibility,
but
the
home
conditions
of
the
child
are
relevant
to
maintaining
the
child
in
that
program.
if
the
child
cannot
be
maintained
in
their
home
then
he
must
either
be
removes
or
steps
taken
to
improve
the
home,
but
that's
as
important
an
aspect
of
the
program
as
the
other.
we
are
aiming
at
the
child,
and
seeing
the
home
in
this
respect
is
as
important
as
the
technical
eligibility
factors.
in
my
reply
brief
in
this
court,
i
cited
two
instances
which
i
think
illustrate
--
one
illustrates
one
of
these
factors
and
the
other
illustrates
the
other.
the
first
one
referred
to
was
an
example
from
the
selected
sample
in
the
declaration
system
and
it
was
a
woman
who
had
applied
for
assistance
and
been
accepted
for
assistance
on
the
ground
that
her
husband
had
deserted
her
and
assistance
was
given.
however,
a
spot
check
was
made
and
the
worker
discovered
the
husband
in
the
home.
it
was
quite
as
simple
as
that.
the
result
of
that
was
a
support
hearing,
a
payment
of
rent
arrears,
a
reference
to
a
marriage
counselor,
but
an
ineligible
family
was
not
put
on
the
rolls
and
that
was
purely
technical
eligibility
factor.
the
other
case
was
far
more
drastic
in
what
happened
and
far
less
precise
in
what
the
worker
could
determine.
this
was
a
recertification
visit
under
new
york
law
and
in
non-experimental
area,
under
the
present
system,
and
the
worker
walked
into
the
home
and
knew
that
the
family
consisted
of
the
mother
and
three
children.
and
she
walked
into
the
home
and
she
saw
the
mother
and
the
oldest
child
and
not
the
other
two
children
and
the
home
atmosphere
quite
simply
disturbed
her.
she
was
told
that
one
child
was
with
his
maternal
grandparents
and
that
the
other
child
was
with
some
neighbor,
but
she
wasn't
sure
which
and
that's
all
she
did.
but
she
was
disturbed
and
she
went
back
to
her
center
and
she
called
the
maternal
grandparents
and
they
had
not
heard,
they
did
not
have
the
infant
and
they
were
not
aware
of
where
the
infant
was.
the
maternal
grandparents
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
maternal
grandparents
who
apparently
were
more
aware
of
the
disturbed
nature
of
the
mother
than
the
other,
than
even
the
center,
went
immediately
to
the
home.
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
younger
two
children
in
fact
were
dead
and
that
the
oldest
child
was
brought
into
the
center.
but
there
was
no
precise
element
in
that
home
for
which
you
could
a
warrant
or
on
which
you
could
base
any
kind
of
determination
and
yet
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
agency
which
must
provide
for
the
care
children
in
the
home
only
so
long
as
they
can
be
cared
for
in
the
home,
to
find
out
what
happened
to
those
children
and
that
was
the
way
they
did
it.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
administrative
steps
are
established
by
regulation
mr.
justice
that
a
visit
must
be
made.
well,
a
contact
is
supposed
to
be
made
in
afdc
cases
every
three
months.
this
had
been
--
it
had
been
the
policy
to
make
the
visit
every
three
months
and
this
would
be
on
a
regular
schedule
devised
by
the
center
itself
which
was
sending
out
the
case
workers.
the
case
loads
have
made
every
three
months
impossible
in
new
york
city
and
it
has
been
reduced
to
every
six
months
at
this
point.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
have
no
authority
to
make
a
recertification
visit
for
that
purpose.
i
think
that
eligibility
itself,
technical
eligibility
is
only
in
those
set
slot
periods.
now
there
maybe
instances,
there
are
in
mrs.
james
case
where
home
visits
were
made
other
than
recertification
times,
but
in
those
instances
it
was
basically
two
verify
information
at
the
request
of
the
client.
certainly,
at
the
request
of
the
client
it
can
be
made
and
i
think
that
the
agency
would
have
discretion
where
factors
warranted
to
make
a
visit
outside
of
the
certification
period.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
district
court
did
make
some
suggestions.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
the
suggestions
for
the
warrant
the
district
court
made
which
are
no
other
alternative
available,
limited
to
a
specific
element
which
you
may
not
be
able
to
find
out
about
until
you
make
the
home
visit.
this
is
particularly
true
with
preschool
children
to
whom
there
is
otherwise
no
access
until
something
happens
to
them.
it's
simply
unworkable
and
it
would
require
on
an
individualized
case
basis
who
would
have
to
setup
the
kind
of
body
of
case
law
that
we
have
now
for
criminal
fourth
amendment
cases.
i
think
one
of
the
crucial
distinction
is
between
the
camara
decision
of
this
court
and
the
reliance
placed
on
it
by
the
district
court
is
just
this
distinction,
because
what
the
district
court
does
in
mandating
a
warrant
procedure
is
to
restructure
the
home
visit,
to
make
it
no
longer
reasonable,
to
make
it
on
a
periodic
basis
and
yet
it
clearly
is
and
it
is
related
so
closely
to
valid
purposes
that
it
clearly
is
reasonable.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
there
are
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
citations
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
they
are
not
in
the
appendix,
but
they
are
i
believe
in
the
record.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
regulations
preclude
a
visit
without
consent
that
is
it
may
not
be
a
forced
admission.
there
may
not
be
a
looking
into
closets
or
into
any
closed
area.
it
may
not
be
made
outside
of
normal
working
hours.
in
fact,
mrs.
james
in
this
case
proscribed
areas
such
as
the
bedroom,
when
she
said,
you
may
not
--
the
door
was
closed.
she
said,
you
may
not
enter;
the
worker
did
not
enter.
so
that
it
really
is
carefully
limited
by
federal
and
state
regulation
and
if
there
is
any
abuse
of
it,
of
course,
it
can
be
resolved
at
a
hearing
before
benefits
are
ever
terminated.
ms.
brenda
soloff
as
far
as
i
know
mr.
justice,
they
do.
mrs.
james
certainly
did.
she
was
not
at
least
bit
intimidated.
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
during
the
home
visit.
she
had
a
lawyer
after,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
how
much
prior
to
that
she
had
a
lawyer,
i
don't
know,
but
this
was
her
attitude
from
the
beginning
and
it
was
perfectly
proper.
ms.
brenda
soloff
mr.
justice,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
the
average
recipient
knows
the
regulations.
he
was
informed
at
the
time
when
his
application
is
taken
of
investigative
procedures.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
would
not
think
that
he
is
told
that,
but
i
would
also
not
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think,
no.
i
think
there
is
no
charge
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
is
looking
for
evidence
of
eligibility
and
of
the
wellbeing
of
the
children.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
means
whatever
he
can
establish
from
what
he
can
see
in
the
apartment
and
what
he
can
observe
of
the
workings
of
the
apartment,
the
relationship
of
the
people.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
average
warrant
would
authorize
greater
intrusion
into
more
areas
than
the
worker.
there
is
no
charge
in
any
of
these,
either
by
this
appellee
or
by
any
of
the
other
people
who
submitted
affidavits
that
that
is
their
problem
in
this
case.
none
of
them
has
ever
charged
that
kind
of
abuse
by
a
caseworker.
i
would
like
briefly
to
say
that
as
i
have
said
that
the
warrant
procedure
really
would
restructure
the
home
visit
and
that
it
is
reasonable
as
it
stands
that
the
reason
if
the
home
visit
is
to
be
allowed
as
it
presently
stands
than
the
warrant
would
serve
no
useful
purpose.
in
camara,
it
served
the
purpose
of
creating
a
relationship
between
the
client
or
the
householder
and
the
authority
which
sought
to
make
the
entry,
but
that's
not
necessary
in
this
case.
the
relationship
is
established
and
no
--
the
limitations
are
established
and
no
warrant
is
necessary
and
finally,
we
have
in
the
warrant,
pardon
me
in
the
home
visit
situation,
we
have
a
pre-termination
hearing
which
protects
against
any
arbitrary
use
of
authority
before
benefits
can
ever
be
terminated
and
this
protects
a
client
more
so
than
in
x
party
warrant
procedure
which
would
permit
invasion,
and
would
not
permit
the
client
to
state
his
side
of
the
case
and
would
not
protect
against
the
kind
of
abuse
that
is
suggested,
the
asking
of
the
relevant
questions,
looking
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
do
mr.
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
the
decision
of
this
court
basically
in
goldberg
against
kelly,
so
that
that
procedure
protects.
one
other
suggestion
is
made
that
the
warrant
is
necessary,
because
we
are
really
looking
for
signs
of
criminal
activity.
we
are
not
really
looking
for
signs
of
criminal
activity.
that
is
another
case.
it's
possible
that
it
could
be
excluded
at
a
criminal
proceeding,
it's
possible
that
it
would
be
valid
to
introduce
it
at
a
criminal
proceeding.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
know
of
no
prosecution
that's
based
on
results
of
a
home
visit
and
i
might
say
that
if
information
is
required
to
be
given
no
matter
where
it's
given
and
if
it's
false
in
a
really
--
in
a
fraudulent
sense,
then
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
given
in
the
home
or
obtained
for
the
home
or
if
it's
given
in
the
office.
the
same
result
can
follow
and
the
result
would
be
too
broad
for
a
reasonable
administrative
purpose.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
correct
mr.
justice.
it
has
been
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
at
all
mr.
justice,
it
does
not.
we
have
not
denied
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
relevant
aspect
of
this
case,
but
it's
the
right
of
privacy
and
not
the
traditional,
criminal

ms.
brenda
soloff
no
we
do
not,
we
deny
in
that
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
then
you
come
much
closer
to
the
camara
situation,
but
we
don't
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
mr.
justice,
we
are
saying
that
we
must
be
able
to
determine
eligibility
to
the
extent
that
it's
conditioned.
it's
conditioned
on
the
furnishing
of
eligibility
information.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
in
most
cases.
now,
maybe
at
this
hearing
that
it
can
be
learned
that
the
information
is
available
without
the
home
visit,
but
that
really
is
a
question
for
the
agency
and
it's
not
for
the
client
to
exercise
an
option
to
decide
how
he
is
going
to
provide
the
information.
thank
you.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
are.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right
mr.
justice.
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
have,
yes.
the
fact
that
a
client
understands
that
this
is
an
aspect
of
a
visit
would
be,
maybe
a
factor
in
his
determining
whether
to
pursue
the
application
just
as
all
other
investigative
aspects,
maybe
a
factor
in
his
determining
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
pursue
the
application.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
would
just
like
to
say
that,
i
would
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
first
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
am
sorry.
mr.
justice
brennan's
first
question
to
mr.
weiss
in
respect
to
what
can
happen
at
a
hearing.
it
would
appear
that
mrs.
james'
assistance
was
terminated
because
of
her
refusal,
but
in
point
of
fact
as
i
said
the
referee
did
set
out
what
the
refusal
was
supposed
to,
what
the
visit
was
supposed
to
accomplish,
and
mrs.
james
did
not
set
forth
any
reason
why
the
visit
should
not
be
made.
in
fact
her
refusal
was
completely
arbitrary.
we
don't
have
another
case
in
which
--
at
least
there
is
none
that
has
come
to
anybody's
attention
in
which,
assistance
has
been
terminated
solely
for
refusal
to
permit
visit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
say
that
we
have
no
other
case
but
this
one,
mr.
justice
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
no
reason
was
advanced
why
the
visit
should
not
be
made
and
so
that
the
flat
face
of
the
record
appears
to
support
that
the
position
whereas
it's
not
least
bit
necessary.
ms.
brenda
soloff
then
i
think
it
is
up
to
--
again
we're
talking
somewhat
in
the
dark,
that
she
did
not
go
to
a
state
fair
hearing,
but
i
think
that
the
result
would
be
up
to
the
referee
to
determine
if
the
department
was
correct
that
the
option
was
unacceptable,
that
the
alternative
was
unacceptable.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
statute
requires
an
initial
home
visit.
the
regulation,
pardon
me
the
state
regulation.
thereafter
it
requires
periodic
contact
which
maybe
by
home
visit,
office
visit,
or
another
method.
it
does
not
explicitly
require
that
in
all
cases
for
a
continuing
eligibility
there
would
be
a
home
visit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
so
that
the
referee
would
have
some
latitude
in
this
respect.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
not
that
they
don't
care,
it's
that
there
is
the
possibility,
but
that
is
alternative
means,
but
that
it's
also
possible
that
alternative
means
will
not
work.
in
fact
that
home
visit
has
been
the
traditional
means
of
verifying.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
can't
think
that
another
one
would
work
as
effectively.
i
mean
that's
the
answer,
that's
the
closest
we
can
get,
whether
or
not
the
state
would
allow
or
the
federal
government
would
permit
it
to
accept
other
evidence.
it's
not
constitutionally
required
to
do
so.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
suppose
that,
that
is
possible
mr.
justice.
what's
happening
here
is
the
welfare
programs
are
changing.
we
are
trying
to
reconcile
the
recognized
dignity
of
the
individual
with
the
need
to
have
a
workable
welfare
program.
the
home
visit
is
changing
in
this
respect
too.
it
is
being
adapted
to
the
new
programs
and
we
are
trying
to
see
if
the
new
programs
work,
and
we
simply
don't
know,
and
what
what
they
are
asking
for
that
a
declaration
system
or
something
very
closely
akin
to
it,
be
established
as
a
constitutional
variety
at
a
time
when
the
evidence
simply
is
not
in
that
works
now.
ms.
brenda
soloff
mrs.
james
says
one
child.
he
is
now,
i
guess,
about
three
years
old
and
i
do
not
have
the
figure
for
a
family
of
two
under
the
revised
standard
of
need
in
new
york
city
at
this
time.
ms.
brenda
soloff
new
york
state
case
went
separately
from
its
grants
for
other
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
new
york
pays
rent
apart
from
the
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
remember
what
her
last
--
her
last
rent
that
i
recall
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
$100
a
month,
but
i
don't
remember
precisely
because
she
has
moved
a
number
of
times.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
an
apartment,
it's
an
apartment
i
believe,
it's
three
or
four
rooms.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
it
does,
but
i
can't
cite
the
section
of
the
law
in
which
that
happens,
it
would
be
under
the
family
law,
i
think.
ms.
brenda
soloff
they
do.
i
am
quite
sure
they
check
foster
homes,
they
check
the
adopted
homes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
thank
you.
