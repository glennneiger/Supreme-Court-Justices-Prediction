mr.
jonathan
weiss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
attempt
to
focus
the
argument
on
two
crucial
factors
to
present
this
case.
they
are,
the
place
involved,
the
act
involved.
what's
at
stake
here
is
an
unwanted
intrusion
into
the
home.
the
act
is
intrusion
against
the
will
into
a
person's
private
home.
there
is
no
claim
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
that
all
homes
visits
are
always
bad
when
welfare
recipients
want
welfare
workers,
or
friends
or
caseworker
at
their
home,
no
one
has
any
complaint.
what's
at
stake
here
is
the
forcing,
the
insistence
of
a
visit
by
a
welfare
caseworker,
a
person
who
is
hired
to
check
certain
elementary
facts
in
certain
mechanical
way,
who
has
no
training
and
no
experience,
a
social
worker
who
insists,
however,
of
going
into
the
home.
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think,
illustrate
all
the
various
dangers
involved
in
such
a
forcing
of
a
visit.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
there
is
much
more
that
happens.
what
happens
as
in
this
case,
they
have
prior
hearing
as
mandated
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
goldberg
versus
kelly
at
which
point
a
hearing
officer
who
is
not
empowered
to
reach
constitutional
issues,
who
is
not
a
lawyer,
informs
the
welfare
recipient
all
the
regulations
as
in
this
case
and
then
they
terminate
aid
at
that
moment.
with
that
termination
of
aid,
that
was
imminent
that
compelled
the
district
court
in
this
case
to
issue
a
temporary
restraining
warrant.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that
is
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
â€“
when
suit
is
from
that
as
pointed
out
in
the
appellant's
reply
brief
is
the
termination
of
aid
and
then
in
their
concern
for
the
child
they
may
then
decide
what
necessary
steps
i
believe
that
is
word
of
the
appellant's
reply
brief.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
that's
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case
and
then
aid
was
terminated.
at
the
hearing
where
mrs.
james
is
represented
by
counsel
the
welfare
department
informs
it
would
give
any
information,
any
sort,
any
place,
but
that
home
but
she
did
not
want
the
you
to
visit.
the
welfare
department
said
the
regulations
means
that
because
it's
refusal,
your
aid
must
now
be
terminated,
and
it
was
terminated.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
what
happened
here,
your
honor.
so
that
all
we
are
talking
about
in
the
prior
hearing
is
merely
internal
administrative
mechanical
apparatus
which
leads
the
termination
of
aid,
his
refusal
to
permit
an
unwanted
entry.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
your
honor
there
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
only
--
no.
what
the
client
said
was,
if
you
want
specific
information,
tell
me
what
you
want
and
i
will
go
any
place,
but
here
and
give
that
information.
they
then
at
that
point
had
said
to
her,
well,
we
need
this
and
that,
this
and
that.
i
presume
she
would
have
offered
it
and
i
believe
there
was
a
nature
of
proffer
at
that
moment.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
no
more
than
internal
revenue
service
is
required
to
take
the
word
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no
more
than
in
analogous
case
the
internal
revenue
service
wished
to
check
whether
somebody
had
a
dependent,
in
fact
living
with
him
or
whether
they
had
a
robbery
of
various
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
your
honor,
it's
our
contention
that
there
is
really
is
no
need
for
warrants
in
the
case
of
welfare
clients.
all
the
purposes
served
by
warrants
are
gotten
by
warrants
from
other
statutes.
if
in
fact
you
are
worried
about
somebody
misrepresenting,
whether
they
are
eligible,
what
resources
they
have.
if
in
fact
they
are
doing
that,
they
are
liable
under
the
statutes
of
fraud
and
a
warrant
could
issue
to
ascertain
that
upon
probable
cause.
if
we
are
dealing
with
specter
of
neglect
and
abuse
which
is
not
specter
only
for
welfare
clients,
who
suddenly
become
abusing,
neglecting
parents
because
they
need
money
from
the
state
for
all
people,
if
that
specter
arises,
we
proceed,
we
do
for
all
families,
that
is,
warrants
issue
under
the
family
court
act.
there
are
warrants
to
cover
every
single
possibility
for
the
purposes
of
statutes.
there
is
no
purpose
in
the
welfare
statute
that
i
think,
would
require
a
warrant.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor
unless
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
intrusion
at
home
is
defined,
the
strictures
are
definable
generally
and
specifically.
generally,
the
assumption
is
and
the
whole
historical
meaning
of
the
cases
and
the
tradition
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
that
no
one
should
go
into
home
except
for
matters
of
public
safety,
which
would
involve
damage,
for
example,
the
children
on
neglect
statutes,
crimes,
public
menaces
on
their
health,
that
is
a
category
under
which
this
court
deploying
the
fourth
amendment,
permits
intrusion
into
the
home.
that
sort
one
of
the
intrusion,
that's
what
general
warrant
for
intrusion,
you
need
a
specific
warrants
on
probable
cause.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
neither
there
is
general
nor
the
specifically
on
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
one
of
the
issue.
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
which
allows
for
double-checking
when
there
has
been
an
misrepresentation
just
as
we
have
for
example
again
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
if
the
welfare
department
has
reason
to
believe
that
somebody
has
misrepresented
their
eligibility,
then
they
can
refer
to
the
criminal
branch
to
get
a
warrant
to
check
whether
it
has
been
actual
welfare
fraud.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
conditioning
of
the
receipt
of
public
benefits
upon
a
surrender
of
a
constitutional
privilege
is
of
course
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
that
any
statute
which
permits
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
hew
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
as
i
was
trying
to
suggest
earlier
the
inspectors
for
plumbing
and
so
on
all
deal
with
protecting
lives
outside
that
home.
they
deal
with
problems
of
public
safety.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
well,
if
we
look
at
the
home,
what
we
mean
is
a
family
unit
inside
a
dwelling
place,
now
that
family
unit
can
do
such
a
destructive
act
one
to
the
other
that
is
as
if
they
did
out
in
the
street.
i
mean,
we
would
tolerate
murder
in
our
home.
we
will
not
tolerate
other
matters,
and
while
we
go
in
is
that
it
is
public
act
destructive
of
somebody
in
a
home.
that's
why
we
have
emergency
searches,
that's
why
there
are
warrants
for
various
and
that's
why
they
neglect
petitions.
all
these
deal
with
destruction
of
somebody
who
are
menace
to
the
public
health.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
in
many
cases,
no
doubt.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
make
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
creation
of
family
and
the
dwelling
or
established
family.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
your
honor,
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
is
that
when,
in
fact,
they
place
a
child
with
the
family,
when
they're
engaged
in
the
process
of
creating
that
family
unit,
in
that
home,
you
have
got
to
make
visit,
but
once
that
family
is
established,
once
there
is
an
ongoing
family,
they
have
placed
that
child
there
permanently,
then
i
would
say
they
have
no
warrant.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
there
are
permanent
places
in
the
foster
homes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
believe
the
state
would
have
the
same
duty
towards
that
child
as
they
have
to
any
other
child
living
in
any
other
home.
when
the
parents
are
not
properly
caring
for
the
child,
the
child
would
be
removed
in
line
with
normal
neglect
proceeding
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
--
but
there
are
establishments
of
foster
homes.
there
are
permanent
placements.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
that
you
make
inspection
up
to
the
point
at
which
there
is
a
permanent
placement
in
the
family
establishment.
at
that
point,
that
family
is
like
any
other
family,
and
they
may
not
make
the
visits.
now
it
seemed
to
be
also
a
logic
of
our
position
in
this
case
that
once
you
have
an
established
family,
no
matter
what/how
the
state
deals
with
it,
be
it
that
they
take
taxes,
be
they
give
welfare,
they
may
not
insist
upon
intruding
against
the
will
into
those
homes.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
within
the
dictates
of
cases
such
as
silverthron,
they
would
probably
issue
some
sort
of
process.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
under
the
internal
revenue
service,
of
course,
the
presumption
is
upon
the
taxpayer
to
prove
certain
types
of
deductions
and
they
might
do
that
on
the
grounds
that
they
didn't
have
to
come
forward
and
show
proof
but
that
will
not
allow
the
internal
revenue
service
to
go
into
that
home.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
consequence
of
not
coming
forth
with
evidence,
not
the
consequence
of
refusal
of
entering
into
the
home.
if
the
internal
revenue
service
said,
to
verify
deductions,
we
must
come
to
your
home
sometimes
with
notice,
sometimes
without
notice.
the
ability
to
compel
the
presence
of
your
child,
the
threat
of
cutting
off
all
your
tax
privileges
and
in
fact
attach
your
salary.
i
would
assume
that
this
court
would
find
that
type
of
insistence
as
unconstitutional,
i
hope
we'll
find
the
type
of
insistence
now
before
for
the
court.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
because
the
inspection,
the
intrusion
of
home
is
different
than
the
request
or
demand
for
the
proffering
of
the
information.
there
is
nothing
ingredient
in
the
presentation
of
papers
or
facts.
they
must
be
necessitated
being
in
a
home,
but
what's
crucial
about
a
home
is
how
the
people
living
in
that
home
regard
it
not
whether
the
government
wants
it
as
a
convenience.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
after
this
family
has
been
established,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
have
seen
placements
where
the
welfare
department
was
satisfied
within
a
week
and
never
returned
again.
i've
seen
places
that
have
had
continued
interest
for
a
number
of
years.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
have
seen
them
create
families
over
a
period
of
time,
much
longer
perhaps
made
short,
but
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
an
orphanage?
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
i
would
say,
of
course,
that
could
because
that
is
a
public
institution
using
public
funds,
what
we
deal
with
here
in
this
case
is
a
family
in
a
home.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
a
private
orphanage
is
taxable.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
check
it
out,
where
you
check
out
any
other
organization
making
any
other
exemption.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
difference
is,
in
one
case
you
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
establish
the
existence
of
children
without
a
home
visit,
certainly.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
there
are
two
answers.
one
is,
it's
not
clear
you
can
establish
with
a
visit,
it's
only
possible
to
have
three
children
there
at
certain
times
and
i
sleep
here,
i
sleep
there,
i
sleep
there,
and
that
will
be
true.
you
have
the
same
problem
of
verification
of
that
phenomenon
when
you
do
it
to
any
other.
you
can
ask,
i
suppose
if
that
doesn't
intrude
into
privacy,
neighbors,
you
can
ask
them
to
prove
it,
you
can
see
whether
the
children
are
registered
at
school,
you
can
take
all
types
of
testimony
you
can
for
that.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
if
they're
under
school
age,
you
talk
to
whatever
community
health
service
they
use,
where
they're
registered.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
don't
think
you
can
establish
anything
in
these
matters
beyond
a
certain
point.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
i
think
you
go
about
trying
to
verify
that
fact
to
do
any
other
fact.
you
can't
prove
it
to
a
certainty
of,
they
sleep
over
one
night,
they
sleep
over
five
nights,
ten
nights
or
hundred
nights
somewhere
else,
when
they
does
it
end,
when
do
they
not
live
in
there.
it's
not
clear,
but
in
any
event
the
fact
that
you
insist
upon
going
to
the
home
at
a
certain
point,
and
they
claim
that
they
give
notice
and
sometimes
they
do,
that
is
not
going
to
prove
anything
at
all.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
they
gave
notice
in
this
case
and
not
given
notice
in
others,
and
as
their
affidavits
bear
out,
it's
up
to
the
case
worker
to
decide
when
notice
is
appropriate,
but
leaving
the
notice
issue
aside,
there
is
problem
with
verifying
any
claim
any
person
makes
about
how
he
lives
in
his
home.
there
are
claims
all
the
time
made
for
all
sorts
of
purposes.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that
would
be
not
be
probable
cause,
i
would
think
cases
such
as
gouled
versus
united
states
suggest
that
probable
cause
involves
the
use
of
an
element
to
be
admissible
at
a
trial
for
the
proof
of
something
that
goes
to
the
statute,
and
i
would
think
you
would
have
to
find,
if
in
fact,
warrants
were
necessary
in
the
welfare
area,
certain
specific
items
that
were
necessary
to
be
found,
only
be
found
by
a
search
in
order
to
fulfill
certain
purposes
of
the
welfare
statute.
but
the
welfare
statute
as
it
now
is,
all
they
need
to
know
is
how
is
it
claimed,
and
the
fact
of
how
many
children
are
dependent
upon
that
person,
just
as
the
internal
revenue
service
needs
to
know
how
many
dependents
are
there
when
you
fill
out
your
tax
forms.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
well,
what
it
seemed
--
as
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
points
out,
the
practicality
goes
the
other
way,
of
course
that
lack
of
staff
means
you
shouldn't
make
home
visits,
that's
what
the
union
of
social
worker
say
that.
assuming
they
did,
administrative
convenience
can
never
be
an
excuse
for
unconstitutional
intrusions.
if
the
police
department
were
to
say,
we
are
having
trouble
locating
people
who
steal,
we
don't
have
staff,
therefore
we
are
going
to
make
a
blanket
search
of
say,
the
area
near
14th
and
park
road
here
that
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional,
so
too
is
unconstitutional
here,
if
they
were,
as
it
cannot
be
a
claim
that's
more
practical
and
more
easy
to
make
home
visits
to
verify
the
simple
questions
of
the
size
and
nature
of
the
family
composition.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
depends
on
what
our
attitude
towards
those
children
were.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
would
depend
on
her
attitude,
if
in
fact
she
viewed
it
as
an
insult,
an
embarrassment.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
think
she
might.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
am
not
privy
to
all
women
psychologies
at
all
times.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
what
she
was
saying
is
that
she
an
established
here
home
as
people
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
what's
reasonable
about
that
is
that
it's
reasonable
that
anybody
in
the
history
of
civilization
saying,
my
home
is
my
private
domain,
and
i
do
not
want
people
there,
i
do
not
want,
and
it
is
my
choice
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
is
not
true
they
support
her
children.
what
is
true
is
they
supply
money,
support
requires
more
than
money,
she
supports
her
children,
she
raises
them,
she
talks
to
them,
she
clothes
them,
she
feeds
them.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
if
you
are
getting
to
receiving
money
in
order
for
her
to
rear
her
children,
to
raise
them
as
every
other
family
raises
their
children.
she
is
in
receipt
of
money.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
am
saying,
it's
reasonable
for
her
to
refuse
as
every
other
family.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
and
i
would
say
it
is
not
typical
and
fundamental,
which
is
the
right
of
a
family
to
insist
on
its
privacy,
in
its
own
home.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
it's
true
in
new
york
that
there
is
no
longer
any
of
these
special
grants
as
they
were
called,
but
if
in
fact
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
they
were,
your
honor,
if
they
came
back
--
if
in
fact,
they
believe
that
she
were
lying,
she
would
be
liable
as
anybody
else
who
lies,
the
government
is
liable
for
criminal
prosecutions
and
a
warrant
could
issue
to
inspect
that
home
to
see
if
she
lied
about
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
heater
and
she
in
fact
had,
she
could
then
be
prosecuted,
and
necessary
steps
taken.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no
more
than
anytime
you
fill
out
government
forms
of
any
sort.
all
of
those
still
are
government
forms
anytime
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
but
some
of
them
will
get
much
more
money
much
more
often,
the
welfare
recipients.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
believe
that
new
york,
the
welfare
rolls
in
new
york
city
are
approximately
1,000,000
to
1,200,000.
i
think
it's
the
largest
welfare
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
the
majority
of
welfare
recipients
are
anymore
honest
or
dishonest
then
rest
of
us.
i
don't
believe
that
this
would
be
matter
for
welfare
workers,
but
if
a
welfare
worker
were
to
believe
that
a
particular
act
of
fraud
had
been
committed,
you
refer
to
the
police
department.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
think
it
would
not
be
justified
no
more
than
--
again
the
internal
revenue
service
would
be
justified
in
refusing
something.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
think
you
can
proffer
the
same
sort
of
the
evidence
for
a
heater,
bill
of
sale,
bill
of
repair,
that
you
would
in
fact
the
revenue
service
to
report
a
robbery
deduction,
a
proper
certain
types
of
proofs
of
sale.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
do
not
think
that
all
welfare
recipients
always
refuse
home
visits.
some
welcome
it,
some
welcome
the
conservation.
i
would
think
of
the
people
who
are
eager
or
willing
to
receive
home
visits,
they
would
get
an
adequate
sample
for
their
purposes.
there
are
also
are
as
the
amicus
from
san
mateo
county,
would
force
this
court
other
hew
regulations
which
seemed
in
fact
to
militate
against
the
type
of
home
visit
present
in
this
case.
those
regulations
i
believe
reflect
the
constitutional
commands
present
in
this
case
and
manifested
the
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
hew
regulation
says
that
nobody
should
demand
entrance,
they
should
not
go
into
homes
without
prior
consent.
yet
that
is
what
they
seek
to
do
here
by
saying,
if
you
do
not
let
us
in,
we
will
call
off
your
welfare.
that
of
course
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
coercion
in
the
confession
case
of
lynumn
versus
illinois,
so
to
here
this
coercion
and
therefore
not
consent,
i
would
say,
waiver
against
the
hew
regulation
reflects,
i
believe
a
constitutional
mandate.
in
sum,
i
would
say
that
what
the
welfare
department
seeks
to
do
is
send
improper
people
into
an
inappropriate
place
to
achieve
results
irrelevant
to
welfare
statute
which
in
fact
violates
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
attempt
to
focus
the
argument
on
two
crucial
factors
to
present
this
case.
they
are,
the
place
involved,
the
act
involved.
what's
at
stake
here
is
an
unwanted
intrusion
into
the
home.
the
act
is
intrusion
against
the
will
into
a
person's
private
home.
there
is
no
claim
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
that
all
homes
visits
are
always
bad
when
welfare
recipients
want
welfare
workers,
or
friends
or
caseworker
at
their
home,
no
one
has
any
complaint.
what's
at
stake
here
is
the
forcing,
the
insistence
of
a
visit
by
a
welfare
caseworker,
a
person
who
is
hired
to
check
certain
elementary
facts
in
certain
mechanical
way,
who
has
no
training
and
no
experience,
a
social
worker
who
insists,
however,
of
going
into
the
home.
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think,
illustrate
all
the
various
dangers
involved
in
such
a
forcing
of
a
visit.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
there
is
much
more
that
happens.
what
happens
as
in
this
case,
they
have
prior
hearing
as
mandated
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
goldberg
versus
kelly
at
which
point
a
hearing
officer
who
is
not
empowered
to
reach
constitutional
issues,
who
is
not
a
lawyer,
informs
the
welfare
recipient
all
the
regulations
as
in
this
case
and
then
they
terminate
aid
at
that
moment.
with
that
termination
of
aid,
that
was
imminent
that
compelled
the
district
court
in
this
case
to
issue
a
temporary
restraining
warrant.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that
is
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
â€“
when
suit
is
from
that
as
pointed
out
in
the
appellant's
reply
brief
is
the
termination
of
aid
and
then
in
their
concern
for
the
child
they
may
then
decide
what
necessary
steps
i
believe
that
is
word
of
the
appellant's
reply
brief.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
that's
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case
and
then
aid
was
terminated.
at
the
hearing
where
mrs.
james
is
represented
by
counsel
the
welfare
department
informs
it
would
give
any
information,
any
sort,
any
place,
but
that
home
but
she
did
not
want
the
you
to
visit.
the
welfare
department
said
the
regulations
means
that
because
it's
refusal,
your
aid
must
now
be
terminated,
and
it
was
terminated.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
what
happened
here,
your
honor.
so
that
all
we
are
talking
about
in
the
prior
hearing
is
merely
internal
administrative
mechanical
apparatus
which
leads
the
termination
of
aid,
his
refusal
to
permit
an
unwanted
entry.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
your
honor
there
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
only
--
no.
what
the
client
said
was,
if
you
want
specific
information,
tell
me
what
you
want
and
i
will
go
any
place,
but
here
and
give
that
information.
they
then
at
that
point
had
said
to
her,
well,
we
need
this
and
that,
this
and
that.
i
presume
she
would
have
offered
it
and
i
believe
there
was
a
nature
of
proffer
at
that
moment.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
no
more
than
internal
revenue
service
is
required
to
take
the
word
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no
more
than
in
analogous
case
the
internal
revenue
service
wished
to
check
whether
somebody
had
a
dependent,
in
fact
living
with
him
or
whether
they
had
a
robbery
of
various
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
your
honor,
it's
our
contention
that
there
is
really
is
no
need
for
warrants
in
the
case
of
welfare
clients.
all
the
purposes
served
by
warrants
are
gotten
by
warrants
from
other
statutes.
if
in
fact
you
are
worried
about
somebody
misrepresenting,
whether
they
are
eligible,
what
resources
they
have.
if
in
fact
they
are
doing
that,
they
are
liable
under
the
statutes
of
fraud
and
a
warrant
could
issue
to
ascertain
that
upon
probable
cause.
if
we
are
dealing
with
specter
of
neglect
and
abuse
which
is
not
specter
only
for
welfare
clients,
who
suddenly
become
abusing,
neglecting
parents
because
they
need
money
from
the
state
for
all
people,
if
that
specter
arises,
we
proceed,
we
do
for
all
families,
that
is,
warrants
issue
under
the
family
court
act.
there
are
warrants
to
cover
every
single
possibility
for
the
purposes
of
statutes.
there
is
no
purpose
in
the
welfare
statute
that
i
think,
would
require
a
warrant.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor
unless
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
intrusion
at
home
is
defined,
the
strictures
are
definable
generally
and
specifically.
generally,
the
assumption
is
and
the
whole
historical
meaning
of
the
cases
and
the
tradition
of
the
fourth
amendment
are
that
no
one
should
go
into
home
except
for
matters
of
public
safety,
which
would
involve
damage,
for
example,
the
children
on
neglect
statutes,
crimes,
public
menaces
on
their
health,
that
is
a
category
under
which
this
court
deploying
the
fourth
amendment,
permits
intrusion
into
the
home.
that
sort
one
of
the
intrusion,
that's
what
general
warrant
for
intrusion,
you
need
a
specific
warrants
on
probable
cause.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
neither
there
is
general
nor
the
specifically
on
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
one
of
the
issue.
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
which
allows
for
double-checking
when
there
has
been
an
misrepresentation
just
as
we
have
for
example
again
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
if
the
welfare
department
has
reason
to
believe
that
somebody
has
misrepresented
their
eligibility,
then
they
can
refer
to
the
criminal
branch
to
get
a
warrant
to
check
whether
it
has
been
actual
welfare
fraud.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
conditioning
of
the
receipt
of
public
benefits
upon
a
surrender
of
a
constitutional
privilege
is
of
course
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
that
any
statute
which
permits
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
hew
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
as
i
was
trying
to
suggest
earlier
the
inspectors
for
plumbing
and
so
on
all
deal
with
protecting
lives
outside
that
home.
they
deal
with
problems
of
public
safety.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
well,
if
we
look
at
the
home,
what
we
mean
is
a
family
unit
inside
a
dwelling
place,
now
that
family
unit
can
do
such
a
destructive
act
one
to
the
other
that
is
as
if
they
did
out
in
the
street.
i
mean,
we
would
tolerate
murder
in
our
home.
we
will
not
tolerate
other
matters,
and
while
we
go
in
is
that
it
is
public
act
destructive
of
somebody
in
a
home.
that's
why
we
have
emergency
searches,
that's
why
there
are
warrants
for
various
and
that's
why
they
neglect
petitions.
all
these
deal
with
destruction
of
somebody
who
are
menace
to
the
public
health.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
in
many
cases,
no
doubt.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
make
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
creation
of
family
and
the
dwelling
or
established
family.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
your
honor,
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
is
that
when,
in
fact,
they
place
a
child
with
the
family,
when
they're
engaged
in
the
process
of
creating
that
family
unit,
in
that
home,
you
have
got
to
make
visit,
but
once
that
family
is
established,
once
there
is
an
ongoing
family,
they
have
placed
that
child
there
permanently,
then
i
would
say
they
have
no
warrant.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
there
are
permanent
places
in
the
foster
homes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
believe
the
state
would
have
the
same
duty
towards
that
child
as
they
have
to
any
other
child
living
in
any
other
home.
when
the
parents
are
not
properly
caring
for
the
child,
the
child
would
be
removed
in
line
with
normal
neglect
proceeding
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
--
but
there
are
establishments
of
foster
homes.
there
are
permanent
placements.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
that
you
make
inspection
up
to
the
point
at
which
there
is
a
permanent
placement
in
the
family
establishment.
at
that
point,
that
family
is
like
any
other
family,
and
they
may
not
make
the
visits.
now
it
seemed
to
be
also
a
logic
of
our
position
in
this
case
that
once
you
have
an
established
family,
no
matter
what/how
the
state
deals
with
it,
be
it
that
they
take
taxes,
be
they
give
welfare,
they
may
not
insist
upon
intruding
against
the
will
into
those
homes.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
would
say
within
the
dictates
of
cases
such
as
silverthron,
they
would
probably
issue
some
sort
of
process.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
under
the
internal
revenue
service,
of
course,
the
presumption
is
upon
the
taxpayer
to
prove
certain
types
of
deductions
and
they
might
do
that
on
the
grounds
that
they
didn't
have
to
come
forward
and
show
proof
but
that
will
not
allow
the
internal
revenue
service
to
go
into
that
home.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
consequence
of
not
coming
forth
with
evidence,
not
the
consequence
of
refusal
of
entering
into
the
home.
if
the
internal
revenue
service
said,
to
verify
deductions,
we
must
come
to
your
home
sometimes
with
notice,
sometimes
without
notice.
the
ability
to
compel
the
presence
of
your
child,
the
threat
of
cutting
off
all
your
tax
privileges
and
in
fact
attach
your
salary.
i
would
assume
that
this
court
would
find
that
type
of
insistence
as
unconstitutional,
i
hope
we'll
find
the
type
of
insistence
now
before
for
the
court.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
because
the
inspection,
the
intrusion
of
home
is
different
than
the
request
or
demand
for
the
proffering
of
the
information.
there
is
nothing
ingredient
in
the
presentation
of
papers
or
facts.
they
must
be
necessitated
being
in
a
home,
but
what's
crucial
about
a
home
is
how
the
people
living
in
that
home
regard
it
not
whether
the
government
wants
it
as
a
convenience.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
after
this
family
has
been
established,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
have
seen
placements
where
the
welfare
department
was
satisfied
within
a
week
and
never
returned
again.
i've
seen
places
that
have
had
continued
interest
for
a
number
of
years.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
have
seen
them
create
families
over
a
period
of
time,
much
longer
perhaps
made
short,
but
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
an
orphanage?
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
i
would
say,
of
course,
that
could
because
that
is
a
public
institution
using
public
funds,
what
we
deal
with
here
in
this
case
is
a
family
in
a
home.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
a
private
orphanage
is
taxable.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
check
it
out,
where
you
check
out
any
other
organization
making
any
other
exemption.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
difference
is,
in
one
case
you
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
establish
the
existence
of
children
without
a
home
visit,
certainly.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
there
are
two
answers.
one
is,
it's
not
clear
you
can
establish
with
a
visit,
it's
only
possible
to
have
three
children
there
at
certain
times
and
i
sleep
here,
i
sleep
there,
i
sleep
there,
and
that
will
be
true.
you
have
the
same
problem
of
verification
of
that
phenomenon
when
you
do
it
to
any
other.
you
can
ask,
i
suppose
if
that
doesn't
intrude
into
privacy,
neighbors,
you
can
ask
them
to
prove
it,
you
can
see
whether
the
children
are
registered
at
school,
you
can
take
all
types
of
testimony
you
can
for
that.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
if
they're
under
school
age,
you
talk
to
whatever
community
health
service
they
use,
where
they're
registered.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
don't
think
you
can
establish
anything
in
these
matters
beyond
a
certain
point.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no,
i
think
you
go
about
trying
to
verify
that
fact
to
do
any
other
fact.
you
can't
prove
it
to
a
certainty
of,
they
sleep
over
one
night,
they
sleep
over
five
nights,
ten
nights
or
hundred
nights
somewhere
else,
when
they
does
it
end,
when
do
they
not
live
in
there.
it's
not
clear,
but
in
any
event
the
fact
that
you
insist
upon
going
to
the
home
at
a
certain
point,
and
they
claim
that
they
give
notice
and
sometimes
they
do,
that
is
not
going
to
prove
anything
at
all.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
they
gave
notice
in
this
case
and
not
given
notice
in
others,
and
as
their
affidavits
bear
out,
it's
up
to
the
case
worker
to
decide
when
notice
is
appropriate,
but
leaving
the
notice
issue
aside,
there
is
problem
with
verifying
any
claim
any
person
makes
about
how
he
lives
in
his
home.
there
are
claims
all
the
time
made
for
all
sorts
of
purposes.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that
would
be
not
be
probable
cause,
i
would
think
cases
such
as
gouled
versus
united
states
suggest
that
probable
cause
involves
the
use
of
an
element
to
be
admissible
at
a
trial
for
the
proof
of
something
that
goes
to
the
statute,
and
i
would
think
you
would
have
to
find,
if
in
fact,
warrants
were
necessary
in
the
welfare
area,
certain
specific
items
that
were
necessary
to
be
found,
only
be
found
by
a
search
in
order
to
fulfill
certain
purposes
of
the
welfare
statute.
but
the
welfare
statute
as
it
now
is,
all
they
need
to
know
is
how
is
it
claimed,
and
the
fact
of
how
many
children
are
dependent
upon
that
person,
just
as
the
internal
revenue
service
needs
to
know
how
many
dependents
are
there
when
you
fill
out
your
tax
forms.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
well,
what
it
seemed
--
as
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
points
out,
the
practicality
goes
the
other
way,
of
course
that
lack
of
staff
means
you
shouldn't
make
home
visits,
that's
what
the
union
of
social
worker
say
that.
assuming
they
did,
administrative
convenience
can
never
be
an
excuse
for
unconstitutional
intrusions.
if
the
police
department
were
to
say,
we
are
having
trouble
locating
people
who
steal,
we
don't
have
staff,
therefore
we
are
going
to
make
a
blanket
search
of
say,
the
area
near
14th
and
park
road
here
that
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional,
so
too
is
unconstitutional
here,
if
they
were,
as
it
cannot
be
a
claim
that's
more
practical
and
more
easy
to
make
home
visits
to
verify
the
simple
questions
of
the
size
and
nature
of
the
family
composition.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
depends
on
what
our
attitude
towards
those
children
were.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
would
depend
on
her
attitude,
if
in
fact
she
viewed
it
as
an
insult,
an
embarrassment.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
think
she
might.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
am
not
privy
to
all
women
psychologies
at
all
times.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
what
she
was
saying
is
that
she
an
established
here
home
as
people
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
what's
reasonable
about
that
is
that
it's
reasonable
that
anybody
in
the
history
of
civilization
saying,
my
home
is
my
private
domain,
and
i
do
not
want
people
there,
i
do
not
want,
and
it
is
my
choice
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
it
is
not
true
they
support
her
children.
what
is
true
is
they
supply
money,
support
requires
more
than
money,
she
supports
her
children,
she
raises
them,
she
talks
to
them,
she
clothes
them,
she
feeds
them.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
if
you
are
getting
to
receiving
money
in
order
for
her
to
rear
her
children,
to
raise
them
as
every
other
family
raises
their
children.
she
is
in
receipt
of
money.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
am
saying,
it's
reasonable
for
her
to
refuse
as
every
other
family.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
and
i
would
say
it
is
not
typical
and
fundamental,
which
is
the
right
of
a
family
to
insist
on
its
privacy,
in
its
own
home.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
it's
true
in
new
york
that
there
is
no
longer
any
of
these
special
grants
as
they
were
called,
but
if
in
fact
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
they
were,
your
honor,
if
they
came
back
--
if
in
fact,
they
believe
that
she
were
lying,
she
would
be
liable
as
anybody
else
who
lies,
the
government
is
liable
for
criminal
prosecutions
and
a
warrant
could
issue
to
inspect
that
home
to
see
if
she
lied
about
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
heater
and
she
in
fact
had,
she
could
then
be
prosecuted,
and
necessary
steps
taken.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
no
more
than
anytime
you
fill
out
government
forms
of
any
sort.
all
of
those
still
are
government
forms
anytime
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
but
some
of
them
will
get
much
more
money
much
more
often,
the
welfare
recipients.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
believe
that
new
york,
the
welfare
rolls
in
new
york
city
are
approximately
1,000,000
to
1,200,000.
i
think
it's
the
largest
welfare
--
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
the
majority
of
welfare
recipients
are
anymore
honest
or
dishonest
then
rest
of
us.
i
don't
believe
that
this
would
be
matter
for
welfare
workers,
but
if
a
welfare
worker
were
to
believe
that
a
particular
act
of
fraud
had
been
committed,
you
refer
to
the
police
department.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
think
it
would
not
be
justified
no
more
than
--
again
the
internal
revenue
service
would
be
justified
in
refusing
something.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
think
you
can
proffer
the
same
sort
of
the
evidence
for
a
heater,
bill
of
sale,
bill
of
repair,
that
you
would
in
fact
the
revenue
service
to
report
a
robbery
deduction,
a
proper
certain
types
of
proofs
of
sale.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
i
do
not
think
that
all
welfare
recipients
always
refuse
home
visits.
some
welcome
it,
some
welcome
the
conservation.
i
would
think
of
the
people
who
are
eager
or
willing
to
receive
home
visits,
they
would
get
an
adequate
sample
for
their
purposes.
there
are
also
are
as
the
amicus
from
san
mateo
county,
would
force
this
court
other
hew
regulations
which
seemed
in
fact
to
militate
against
the
type
of
home
visit
present
in
this
case.
those
regulations
i
believe
reflect
the
constitutional
commands
present
in
this
case
and
manifested
the
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court.
mr.
jonathan
weiss
the
hew
regulation
says
that
nobody
should
demand
entrance,
they
should
not
go
into
homes
without
prior
consent.
yet
that
is
what
they
seek
to
do
here
by
saying,
if
you
do
not
let
us
in,
we
will
call
off
your
welfare.
that
of
course
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
coercion
in
the
confession
case
of
lynumn
versus
illinois,
so
to
here
this
coercion
and
therefore
not
consent,
i
would
say,
waiver
against
the
hew
regulation
reflects,
i
believe
a
constitutional
mandate.
in
sum,
i
would
say
that
what
the
welfare
department
seeks
to
do
is
send
improper
people
into
an
inappropriate
place
to
achieve
results
irrelevant
to
welfare
statute
which
in
fact
violates
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
