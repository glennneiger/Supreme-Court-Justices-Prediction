justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
soloff,
there
is
a
no
relevant
hew
regulations
on
this
subject,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
sample?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
idea
that
under
that
regulation
the
purposes
of
the
visits
would
be
precisely
the
purpose
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
at
sample,
tell
me
something
more
about
that,
will
you?
how
do
you
select
the
houses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
significance
which
hew
to
the
fact
that
apparently
hew
requires
only
visits?
it
was
sample
of
places
and
not
to
all
those
sharing
in
the
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
you
delete
a
proscription
beyond
the
sample,
in
the
fact
that
that's
all
hew
refer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
the
state
authorities
do
in
compliance
with
the
hew
requirement
of
sample
of
visits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
what
do
new
york
societies
do
in
compliance
to
that
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
they
must
be
reports
of,
what,
a
sample
of
visits
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
the
investigation
including
the
home
visits
deemed
only
at
a
surveillance
to
determine
eligibility
or
continued
eligibility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see,
does
that
mean
the
example
of
an
investigation
is
closed.
the
mother
with
her
single
child
is
an
alcoholic,
and
all
of
the
money
she
gets
goes
into
the
purchase
of
liquor
and
she
doesn't
--
and
none
of
it
goes
buy
food
for
the
child
or
something
like
that.
that
then
means,
eligibility
maybe
terminated,
so
the
child
gets
nothing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
gather
until
hearing,
termination
hearing,
the
decision
following
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
have
there
been
prosecutions
based
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
(inaudible)
they
replied,
they
say,
well,
the
information
is
available
without
a
home
visit
in
this
way,
did
that
made
the
client
do
that
?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wait
a
minute.
i
mean
that
even
if
the
information
is
available
by
some
other
alternative
to
a
home
visit,
the
refusal
of
the
home
visit
automatically
results
in
a
hearing
officer's
finding
that
aid
is
terminated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
satisfy
the
requirement
of
probable
cause
for
warrant
in
this
context?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
your
view
of
this
scheme
by
statute
if
it
were
to
provide
a
client
must
permit
home
visits
to
continue
receiving
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
do
differ
that
from
the
requirements
and
inspection
of
plumbing
in
tenement
house
clause
and
as
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
weiss,
may
i
ask,
if
you
were
to
prevail
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
decision
upon
the
hew
regulation
which
is
the
(inaudible)
requires
that
some
kind
of
sampling
and
a
report
as
a
condition
i
gather
to
continue
participation
in
the
federal
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
sum
up
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought
that
is
what
mr.
weiss
said,
the
termination
hearing
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
an
inquiry,
it
was
a
refusal,
and
if
it's
found
that
it
was
refusal,
then
automatically
an
order
is
entered,
terminating
benefits.
you
say
that
it's
not
so,
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
that
it
had
been
said
that,
i
can
give
you
this
information,
whatever
it
is
you
want,
without
you
making
a
home
visit,
this
is
the
way
i
will
supply
it
or
whatever,
that
tender
was
made.
what
would
have
been
the
result
if
the
tender
had
been
a
satisfactory
tender
of
evidence
upon
which
it
could
be
concluded
no
home
visit
was
necessary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
soloff,
there
is
a
no
relevant
hew
regulations
on
this
subject,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
sample?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
idea
that
under
that
regulation
the
purposes
of
the
visits
would
be
precisely
the
purpose
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
at
sample,
tell
me
something
more
about
that,
will
you?
how
do
you
select
the
houses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
significance
which
hew
to

unless
you
delete
a
proscription
beyond
the
sample,
in
the
fact
that
that's
all
hew
refer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
the
state
authorities
do
in
compliance
with
the
hew
requirement
of
sample
of
visits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
what
do
new
york
societies
do
in
compliance
to
that
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
they
must
be
reports
of,
what,
a
sample
of

or
what?
justice
william
j.

now
if

that
then
means,
eligibility
maybe
terminated,
so
the
child
gets
nothing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
gather
until
hearing,
termination
hearing,
the
decision
following
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
so
have
there
been
prosecutions
based
on
--
justice
william
j.

now,
(inaudible)
they
replied,
they
say,

the

how
do

what

yes.
justice
william

mr.

may
i
ask,
if
you
were

what
would
be
the

of

you

but
suppose
that
it
had
been

that,
i
can
