black
mr.
weiss,
i
suppose
you
were
called
on
by
a
lady
to
make
a
charitable
constitution
to
her
children.
she
said
she
had
three
children
under
five,
she
was
keeping
them
in
a
house,
it
was
alright.
you
said,
i
will
make
a
contribution
to
them,
but
i
want
to
come
in
and
see
if
the
children
are
in
this
house.
would
that
be
an
unreasonable
request
on
your
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
give
them
anything
in
the
first
place.
would
that
be
an
unreasonable
request
on
your
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
she
did
so,
would
it
be,
you
would
view
it
as
an
insult
that
you
were
meant
to
support
her
children?
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
might.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
reason
now
you
think
it
was
reasonable
for
this
lady
to
say,
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
come
into
this
house,
while
you
are
supporting
my
children
at
all.
i
come
outside,
i
will
go
to
your
office,
but
you
can't
come
in
here
and
look
at
these
children
and
see
how
i
am
taking
care
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let's
get
away
from
establishment.
home
is
not
home,
it's
kept
up
by
the
chairs,
it's
given
by
the
(inaudible).
and
do
you
think
that
there
is
no
right
to
try
to
see
it,
that
she
is
really
taking
care
of
them.
there
are
history
there
are
incidents
in
the
history
of
this
country,
by
even
parents,
have
not
properly
taken
care
of
their
infant
children
when
they
didn't
wanted
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
unreasonable
for
them
to
want
to
look
and
see
how
they
are
taken
are
of?
the
question
is
reasonableness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fabric
and
everything
is
reasonableness.
i
think
it's
unreasonable
about
this
lady
telling
him,
she
won't
let
him
come
in,
she
won't
talk
to
him
in
her
house.
she
doesn't
want
him
to
see
her
children
there,
that
she
will
come
out
and
talk
to
him
at
their
office.
what's
reasonableness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
you
there
even
though
you
support
my
children?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
will
get
insured
from
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
most
of
them
is
of
course
who
pay
them
to
raise
their
children,
but
here
she
has
asked
to
the
state
and
the
government
to
support
her
and
it
is
doing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
it
unreasonable
for
them
to
want
to
go
in
and
see
where
she
is
keeping
these
children
that
they
are
supporting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
technical
reason
you
are
giving,
isn't
it?
it's
not
a
reasonable
one,
going
to
everyday
affairs
of
human
being?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
somebody
else
is
supporting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
how
many
children
they
are
and
what
are
their
ages
and
how
much
they
draw?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
contributed,
anything
for
rent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
she
get
anything
for
rent
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
does
she
get
for
the
rent
of
the
house
in
which
she
lived
with
the
child?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
big
is
the
house?
is
it
an
apartment
or
a
house?
