what
are
the
restrictions
on
the
visit?
they
go
in
any
room?
are
there
any
regulations
which
tell
the
worker
what
she
can
and
cannot
do
when
you
make
a
visit?
justice
thurgood

are
they
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
record,
but
not
in
the
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
the
recipient
know
what
those
regulations
are
and
that
they
have
right
to
tell
them,
you
can't
go
in
those
closed
rooms?
justice
thurgood

mrs.
james
had
lawyer,
didn't
she?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
present
to
this
court
the
fact
that
every
recipient
knows
those
regulations?
you
wouldn't
say
that,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
told
that
it's
up
to
him
or
her
as
to
whether
they
let
them
in
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
told
that
you
can
restrict
movement
when
you
get
in
the
apartment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
pretty
broad
warrant,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
social
work
he
is
looking
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
of
course,
if
you
have
this
warrant
then
its
vagueness
search
in
what
you
search
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
broader
than
a
search
warrant,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
soloff
when
the
application
is
made
aren't
they
told
that
a
part
of
this
is
that
we
will
come
to
your
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
understand
that
when
they
make
their
applications?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
put
any
reliance
on
that?
justice
thurgood

mr.
weiss,
getting
back
into
internal
revenue,
suppose
an
orphanage
gets
tax
an
exemption
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
an
orphanage,
do
you
say
that
internal
revenue
could
go
to
find
if
they
have
any
children
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
an
orphanage
is
a
public
welfare,
you
say
a
private
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
charitable
contributions,
that's
the
one
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
now
getting
closer
to
this
case.
if
there's
an
application
for
this
assessment
and
found
that
they
have
three
children
living
in
that
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
to
establish
without
a
visit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
that
they
said
they
had
three
children
living
in
this
apartment,
how
can
you
establish
that
without
a
visit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
children
that
are
under
school
age?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
you
establish
that
they
live
there
and
not
with
their
grandparents?
justice
thurgood
marshall
obviously,
i
understand
now
your
position
would
be
that
the
applicant
says
i
have
three
children
and
that's
it?
justice
thurgood
