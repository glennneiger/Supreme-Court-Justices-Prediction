you

chief

what
--
has
anyone
suggested
what
allegations
you
would
make
in
an
application
for
a
warrant?
chief

warren
e.

what
do
you
have
to
say
about
their
suggestions?
chief

warren
e.
burger
could
you
elaborate
on
that
a
little
bit
and
summarize
what
are
those
--
what
the
regulations
tell
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
ms.
soloff.
mr.
weiss
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
outside?
is
that
all
they
are
concerned
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
question
mr.
weiss,
were
you
through,
mr.
justice
brennan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
the
foster
home
program
in
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
just
hypothetically,
the
children
are
taken
out
of
their
normal
home,
put
into
a
foster
home
of
some
family
that
has
three
children,
as
sometimes
they
will
in
the
states.
there
are
provisions
for
visitation
by
social
workers
to
those
foster
homes,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
are
private
homes
in
the
same
sense
as
the
home
of
the
recipients
of
aid
dependent
children,
i
take
it
there
is
no
difference,
it's
same
kind
of
a
private
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
state
of
new
york
in
conducting
surveillance
to
see
that
these
foster
homes
need
prescribed
standards
in
the
regulations,
cannot
have
a
visit
to
those
foster
homes,
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
this
a
substitute
family
environment,
the
foster
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
a
child
ever
placed
permanently
in
a
foster
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can't
conceive
of
the
state
making
a
permanent
placement
because
if
the
child
wasn't
getting
the
care,
they'd
certainly
remove
it.
the
state
would
have
a
duty,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
can
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
come
back
to
my
question.
do
you
say
that
the
state
of
new
york
in
pursuance
of
its
program
of
foster
homes
for
the
children
cannot
make
an
inspection
of
these
foster
homes
in
the
conditions
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
take
an
analogy
then
you
referred
to
the
income
tax
problems.
suppose
a
taxpayer
takes
off
and
shows
$8,000
in
interest
payments
on
loans
during
a
given
year,
and
$12,000
in
contributions,
and
then
in
due
course
on
an
examination,
the
agent
writes
or
calls
and
says,
i
would
like
to
see
your
records
and
your
canceled
checks
to
support
these
payments,
and
the
taxpayer
says
no.
no,
these
are
private
records,
private
papers,
a
man's
most
scared
possession,
you
can't
look
at
them,
what
do
you
think
the
internal
revenue
service
is
going
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
they
just
disallow,
disallow
the
deduction
in
very
short
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
consequence
of
not
going
into
that
home
or
the
private
files
would
be
peremptory
disallowance
of
those
claims,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
seem
to
make
a
distinction
mr.
weiss.
you
said
the
internal
revenue
service
places
a
burden
on
the
taxpayer
to
do
certain
things
in
the
statute.
suppose
the
state
of
new
york
if
it
does
not
now
do
so,
places
a
burden
on
the
recipient
of
welfare
aid
as
a
condition
to
continue
the
receipt
of
that
aid
that
they
must
allow
inspections,
wouldn't
that
be
a
parallel
to
the
internal
revenue
illustration
you
gave
me?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
still
stand
on
your
proposition
that
the
foster
home
would
not
be
subject
to
inspection
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
long
after
the
children
are
placed
in
the
foster
home,
does
that
happen
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
can
go
for
a
number
of
years
without
warrants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
weiss,
how
many
people
in
new
york
are
receiving
one
kind
of
aid
and
another
in
new
york
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
big
a
staff
do
they
now
have
if
you
know
to
operate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
california
case
last
year,
the
record
showed
that
for
500,000
people
on
welfare
in
los
angeles
county,
they
had
12,500
caseworkers.
now
if
they
have
got
to
do
what
you've
just
said
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
then
it
would
take
quite
an
army
of
caseworkers
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
the
--
in
this
hypothetical
case,
mr.
justice
white
gave
you
that
they
would
be
justified
in
refusing
to
replace
the
heater
until
they
could
inspect
the
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
do
refuse
a
deduction
if
you
don't
let
them
inspect
your
records,
don't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
weiss.
ms.
soloff,
in
the
case,
i
believe
your
time
is
expired.
unless
you
have
any
factual
matter
that
you
want
to
make
a
correction
of
the
record
above.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
please
just
speak
a
little
louder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
if
you
had
unlimited
funds,
you
could
put
a
24
hours
surveillance
on
the
house
and
if
for
30
days
no
children
were
seen
coming
or
going,
that
might
lead
to
an
inference
that
they
were
either
very
ill
or
that
there
weren't
any
children
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
soloff,
if
you
have
heard
my
hypothetical,
a
factual
situation
i
presented
to
mr.
weiss
about
the
foster
homes.
if
you
know,
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
regulations
and
the
procedure,
does
new
york
state
or
its
subdivisions
conduct
periodic
visitation
to
foster
homes
where
they
place
children
for
time
to
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
certainty,
it'd
be
astonishing
if
they
place
children
in
home
and
then
made
no
check
on
them
to
determine
whether
they
were
being
properly
cared
for
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
