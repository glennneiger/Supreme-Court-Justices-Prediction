justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
own
a
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
could’ve
sold
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
if
a
man
has
64
charges
of
driving
without
a
license,
reckless
driving
and
doing
bodily
harm
with
an
automobile
and
he’s
broke?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
know
the
prison
farm
isn’t
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i’m
sure
texas
doesn’t
have
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
that
if
this
get
a
--
this
$425.00
out
of
figure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
$425.00
figure,
i
would
assume
maybe
he
got
a
$100.00
a
month,
he
could’ve
paid
that
two
buck
fine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
for
example
he
could’ve
bought
a
little
less
gasoline
and
paid
the
$2.00
fine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
want
to
suggest
the
one
thing,
it
might
turn
out
to
be
it
was
gasoline.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
is
$2.00-fine
is
different
from
a
$100.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
the
same
if
there
was
a
thousand
dollars
to
pay
your
argument
would
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
effort
was
made
during
this
year
of
two
period
to
collect
the
fines?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
now
at
the
hearing
when
he
was
sent
away,
what
happened
there
other
than
that
you
don’t
have
the
money
so
you
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
would’ve
been
possible
to
find
out
whether
he
could’ve
paid
it
in
installment?
obviously,
the
judge
could’ve
asked
one
question
“can
you
pay
this
$10.00
a
month?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
anything
in
your
law
that
prohibits
it?
i
would
assume
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
at
least
i
would
assume
that
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
judge
had
said
on
the
day
he
was
fined
$75.00,
you
have
got
two
years
to
pay
this
$75.00.
there
would
be
no
question
about
that.
you
could
do
that
under
the
taxes
law,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
isn’t
that
what
happened?
it
was
two
years
before
he
got
around
to
ask
him
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn’t
deliberately
delay
that
that
was
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you’re
also
make
the
point
that
it’s
different
from
when
he
first
was
picked
up
and
convicted
and
got
$75.00
if
the
judge
had
said
“either
this
or
you
go
to
jail.”
and
this
case
where
by
the
time
they
got
around
to
him,
he
had
nine
other
charges
against
him.
i
think
those
are
two
different
cases,
don’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rollins,
my
final
point
is
the
same
judge
does
have
right
of
probation,
and
do
you
not
have
a
probation
department
in
houston?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
they
could
it
--
no,
but
i’m
--
you
do
have
a
probation
department?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood

did
he
own
