and
that's
or
you
say
mr.

upon
investigation,
find
that
this
man
is
to
be
sure
not
able
to
pay
the
whole
$425.00
now,
but
that
he
can
reasonably
afford
to
pay
$10.00
a

--
justice

stewart
--
that
he
does
get
it
the

a
$104.00
a

from
the
veterans
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whether
or
not
he’s
employed
or
--
justice

--
and
that

he
doesn’t
pay
the
$10.00
a
month,
can
they
then
put

$10.00
a
month
out
of
a
$104.00
a
month,
then
he
doesn’t
pay
it,
then
can
they
put
him
in

that
even
this

--
even
this
court
which
other

has
no
power
to
do
anything

fine
people
as
you
point
out,

you
concede
that
under
the

it
could
put
him
in
jail
if
he
didn’t
pay
the
$10.00
a
month?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
maximum
fine
i
wonder
that
he

totaled,
aggregate
fine?
he
did
get
a
$425.00,
how
much
could’ve
he
been
fined,
a
few
thousand?
justice

found
him
guilty
of
two

for
not
having
a

license
on
a

justice

yes
but
--
the
day
of
the
trial,
you
mean
he
was
coming
homing
from
the
trial?
justice

stewart
well,
what
the
texas

judicial
notice
doesn’t

govern
what
