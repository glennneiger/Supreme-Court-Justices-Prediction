mr.
dorsen,
let
me
interrupt
you
now
and
help
me
out
in
this
respect.
i’d
like
to
change
the
facts
a
little
bit.
i
suppose
if
the
statute
were
only
one
sided,
that
for
this
offense,
ten
days
in
jail,
would
you
be
here
then,
rich
or
poor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
if
there
were
no
fine,
the
statute
were
ten
days
in
jail
for
this
offense,
the
statute
ordinance?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
would
not
be
here.
i
guess
my
question
then
is,
if
you
were
to
prevail
here
in
this
lawsuit,
would
not
the
resulting
tendency
in
ordinances
and
statutes
be
to
make
all
these
offenses
punishable
only
by
imprisonment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
only
suggestion
is
that
if
you
prevail
here,
you
may
provide
an
impetus
for
just
that
thing,
and
of
course
it
ties
in
with
the
thinking
of
some
people
that
one
of
the
solutions
to
our
traffic
carnage
is
to
impose
differ
