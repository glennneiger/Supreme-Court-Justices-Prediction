mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
arising
in
texas
is
a
sequel
to
the
decisions
last
term
in
this
court
in
williams
v.
illinois
and
morris
v.
schoonfield.
it
involves
the
imprisonment
of
an
indigent
for
an
inability
to
pay
certain
fines
imposed
for
traffic
offenses.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
petitioner,
mr.
tate,
committed
several
traffic
offenses
in
1966.
these
offenses
included
driving
without
an
operator’s
license,
driving
a
car
with
expired
license
plates
and
going
through
a
red
light.
neither
alone
nor
taken
together
were
these
offenses
punishable
by
a
jail
sentence.
they
were
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
were
nine
offenses.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
there
were
three
of
those.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
know
that.
it's
probably
$10.00
or
so,
$2.00.
mr.
norman
dorsen
neither
alone,
as
i
said,
or
taken
together
were
these
offenses
punishable
by
a
jail
sentence.
petitioner
was
tried
on
two
of
the
traffic
offenses
in
1966
in
the
houston
corporation
court,
a
court
whose
jurisdiction
is
limited
by
statute
to
offenses
punishable
by
fine
alone.
he
was
convicted
on
the
two
offenses
and
fined
$75.00,
but
the
judgment
was
not
executed.
this
was
explained
by
petitioner
at
the
subsequent
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
the
ground
that
he
had
paid
a
lawyer
to
appeal
the
convictions.
in
fact,
the
lawyer
failed
to
perfect
the
appeal.
if
the
appeal
had
been
perfected,
petitioner
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
county
court
and
relieved,
at
least
temporarily,
from
the
obligation
to
pay
the
fines.
instead,
as
i’ve
said,
the
convictions
became
final,
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
petitioner
ever
knew
that
this
had
occurred.
petitioner’s
attorney
incidentally
has
since
been
disbarred
for
other
reasons.
petitioner
was
not
tried
on
the
remaining
traffic
tickets
until
august
7,
1968.
he
appeared
then
in
the
same
corporation
court,
the
court
with
jurisdiction
only
to
punish
by
fines,
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
other
charges.
the
judge
imposed
fines
which
when
added
to
those
outstanding
from
1966,
totaled
$425.00.
petitioner
being
indigent
was
unable
to
pay
the
fine.
pursuant
to
texas
statutes
and
the
houston
code,
he
was
dispatched
forthwith
to
the
houston
prison
farm
to
serve
85
days
in
jail,
or
one
day
for
each
$5.00
of
the
fine,
the
statutory
rate
in
texas.
the
relevant
statutes
are
found
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
now,
this
was
on
august
7,
1968.
on
august
28,
1968,
petitioner
commenced
a
habeas
corpus
action
and
was
released
the
same
day
on
a
bond
posted
by
a
friend.
he
had
served
21
days
and
the
unpaid
fine
was
now
$320.00
which
would
subject
him
to
64
additional
days
in
jail.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
he
did
not
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
hearing
on
the
habeas
corpus
petition
was
held
in
the
county
criminal
court
on
august
30,
excerpts
from
the
record
of
which
appear
in
the
back
of
petitioner’s
brief,
not
in
the
brown
appendix.
the
certiorari
petition
contains
the
entire
record
of
the
habeas
corpus
petition
--
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
the
county
criminal
court
denied
the
habeas
corpus
petition
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
affirmed
and
the
case
then
came
here
on
certiorari.
there’s
one
further
important
factual
point
i’d
like
to
make
at
the
outset.
although
the
state
in
its
brief
seems
to
dispute
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
indigent
as
of
august
1968,
when
he
was
sent
to
jail
for
nonpayment
of
the
fine,
it
is
in
fact
perfectly
clear
from
the
record
that
the
state
had
stipulated
during
the
hearing
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition
that
petitioner
was
“poverty
stricken
and
that
his
whole
family
has
been
for
all
periods
of
time
therein,
and
probably
always
will
be.”
this
is
in
the
appendix
brief,
page
7a.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
the
reason
that
that
was
not
explored
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
the
garnishment
provisions
in
the
law
of
texas
exempt
levying
on
the
car
of
a
married
man,
so
that
car
couldn’t
have
been
used
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
he
might
have
done
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
first
thing
that
has
to
happen
is
--
if
he
has
no
money,
the
court
as
this
--
the
lower
court,
the
criminal
court
as
this
court
said
in
the
williams
case
last
year
has
several
alternatives.
one
is,
if
he
has
the
possibility
of
earning
some
money
to
stretch
out
the
fine
over
a
period
of
time.
if
that
won’t
work,
another
alternative
is
to
find
a
job
for
him
or
put
him
to
work
on
at
the
prison
farm
or
something
of
the
sort,
but
not
to
confine
him
24
hours
a
day.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
no.
what
i
have
in
mind
there
is
what
the
a.b.a.
in
its
minimum
standards
of
sentencing
provides,
they
call
that
partial
confinement.
the
study
by
the
a.b.a.
concluded
that
in
the
case
of
the
kind
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
they
do
not,
they
do
not.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
if
he
were
confined
only
for
the
purpose
of
having
him
work
out
on
a
job,
the
fine
we
suggest
would
not
be
constitutionally
offensive.
in
other
words,
if
the
man
cannot
pay,
if
it’s
clear
as
mr.
justice
marshall’s
hypothetical
put
it
that
he
wasn’t
able
to
pay,
our
first
constitutional
requirement
following
the
williams
opinion
is
that
perhaps
he
might
pay
if
the
fine
is
stretched
out
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
because
of
course
there
is
a
specific
exception
in
the
thirteenth
amendment
for
persons
convicted
of
a
crime,
but
even
more
important
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
state
--
we
are
not
claiming,
i
wish
to
be
perfectly
clear,
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
state
is
powerless
to
get
at
the
kind
of
person
that
mr.
marshall’s
--
that
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
referred
to.w
e
say
that
the
state
can
take
certain
action.
the
first
thing
they
should
try
to
do
is
to
use
the
installment
method.
if
that
doesn’t
work,
if
there’s
no
likelihood
that
the
installment
method
would
work,
the
kind
of
arrangements
for
working
off
the
fine
over
a
period
of
time
might
be
an
alternative.
now,
the
a.b.a.,
the
commission
to
study
the
federal
penal
code,
all
examined
this
extremely
difficult
problem
because
on
the
one
hand
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
state
should
not
be
powerless
to
proceed
against
an
individual.
on
the
other
hand,
the
underlying
principle
of
the
williams
case
as
i
understand
it
is
that
for
the
person
who
is
without
funds
to
put
him
into
jail
immediately,
which
is
what
happened
here.
there
was
no
hearing,
there
was
no
exploration
of
the
possibility
of
using
these
other
techniques,
we
say
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
court
should
deal
carefully,
to
use
the
phrase
that
mr.
justice
white
used
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
morris
case,
with
the
man
who
is
without
funds,
not
exempt
him,
not
exempt
him
because
as
i
think
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
pointed
out,
there
could
be
a
reverse
discrimination
in
the
case
of
a
person
who
is
indigent
who
won’t
be
able
to
be
proceeded
against
in
any
way
at
all,
we
are
not
claiming
that.
we’re
saying
that
if
a
man
has,
as
this
man
had,
fines
totaling
$425.00
or
whatever
the
sum
would
be
that
the
lower
court
must
deal
with
that
person
individually,
that
there
must
be
a
hearing,
this
also
is
suggested
by
the
a.b.a.
and
by
the
commission
to
reform
the
criminal
law,
and
deal
with
him
in
terms
of
his
particular
situation.
it’s
possible
in
this
case
for
example
since
he
was
getting
a
veteran’s
check
i
think
of
a
$104.00
a
month
that
he
would’ve
been
able
to
pay
out
the
fine
say
$5.00
a
week
or
something
of
this
sort.
the
infirmity
in
the
procedure
here
we’re
suggesting
is
the
immediate
transference
of
an
individual
who
is
poor
to
jail
without
exploration
of
the
various
alternatives
that
were
reviewed
in
the
williams
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
he
had
a
wife
and
two
children
and
a
$104.00
a
month
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
that’s
right.
the
problem
we
have
on
this
record,
mr.
justice
marshall,
which
is
--
which
from
another
point
of
view
is
relevant
to
the
question
you’re
raising
is
that
the
trial
court
did
not
do
what
we
say
is
constitutionally
required,
and
that
is
explore
the
very
questions
that
you’re
raising.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
the
lower
courts
in
these
situations
can
not
just
take
a
person
who
hasn’t
got
the
funds
and
put
him
in
jail.
we
are
not
disputing
the
implications
of
your
question,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice.
we’re
saying
that
as
the
williams
case
said,
the
choice
is
illusory
for
a
man
without
funds.
that
does
not
mean
he
should
be
exempt.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
again
and
again
because
i
think
that’s
a
critical
factor
in
cases
of
this
kind,
but
that
the
lower
court
cannot
just
take
him
and
put
him
in
jail
that
more
is
required
by
the
constitution
to
fulfill
the
mandates
of
the
cases
cited
in
williams
and
the
philosophy
of
the
williams
case
itself
as
i
read
it.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
we
would
say
in
a
case
like
that
that
the
court
should
then
hold
the
kind
of
informal
hearing
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that’s
a
case
of
willful
refusal
to
pay
and
they
could
put
him
in
jail.
we
are
not
claiming
that
in
the
case
like
that
and
i
think
that
the
chief
justice’s
could
express
the
reserve
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
we
would
concede
that
the
willful
refusal
and
i
think
it’s
pertinent
in
that
connection
because
i’m
glad
that
became
clear
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
if
the
fine
were
only
$10.00?
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
assume
we
would
not
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
might
be
such
a
tendency.
it’s
hard
to
speculate
that
what
would
happen
in
each
state.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
many
states
now
provide
for
the
kind
of
arrangement
that
we
are
suggesting
and
some
of
those
as
i
understand
it
to
have
--
have
not
changed
the
law
regarding
to
sentencing.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
other
point
which
i
think
is
related
to
your
question.
the
state
makes
much
of
the
point
and
i
think
that
perhaps
one
or
two
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
indicate
a
concern
about
it
that
this
is
a
scuff
law.
that
this
is
a
fellow
who’s
just
oblivious
to
the
normal
restrictions
that
all
of
us
would
feel
are
binding
in
connection
with
operating
a
motor
vehicle
or
a
license,
and
therefore,
perhaps
he
should
go
to
jail.
now
our
position
on
that
is
two-fold.
one
that
the
state,
as
you
suggest,
can
provide
for
jail
sentences
in
cases
of
this
kind,
repeaters,
people
who
are
chronic
violators.
the
state
of
texas,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
has
not
chosen
to
do
that.
the
second
point
i
would
--
but
we
are
emphasizing
that
that
would
be
a
perfectly
valid
mode
of
correctional
philosophy.
the
second
point
we
would
emphasize
on
this
problem
of,
to
use
the
word
the
state
uses,
the
scuff
law,
is
that
if
people
are
going
to
go
to
jail
for
being
scuff
laws,
rich
people
should
go
to
jail
as
well
as
poor
people.
that
if
a
fellow
were
a
playboy
or
a
fellow
who
had
some
money
in
one
way
or
another
and
violated
the
traffic
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
and
i
assume
there
have
been
some
people
who’ve
done
that
in
texas
as
well
as
in
new
york
and
other
states,
we
say
that
the
law
should
be
applied
equally
to
the
rich
and
the
poor.
texas
could
decide
to
put
them
in
jail.
we
are
not
at
all
disputing
that
power.
in
this
connection
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
may
well
be.
i
would
not
to
dispute
that
as
an
original
question.
i
might
say
in
connection
--
in
terms
of
the
state’s
interest,
the
state
at
several
points
and
very
understandably
from
its
viewpoint,
suggest
that
this
would
be
terrifically
inconvenient
for
the
state
to
do,
terrifically
inconvenient
to
do
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
a.b.a.
has
suggested,
that
the
commission
to
reform
the
federal
law,
federal
criminal
code
has
suggested
that
maryland
now
does,
that
delaware
does,
that
california
does.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
--
that
the
inconvenience
problem
is
to
use
the
vernacular,
a
red
herring,
that
all
the
state
already
has
a
probation
apparatus.
it
already
has
people
who
are
concerned
with
sentencing
--
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
texas
provide
incidentally
for
installment
payments
of
fine
above
$200.00
in
another
connection.
if
you
are
fined
above
$200.00
and
there’s
a
conditions
for
probation
--
as
a
condition
for
probation,
the
court
is
in
powered
under
the
texas
criminal
code
to
provide
for
installments
that
they
don’t
--
that
the
state
doesn’t
find
that
inconvenient.
and
the
american
bar
association
which
went
through
for
all
of
this,
at
great
care,
concluded
that
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask
in
the
interest
of
equal
protection
to
treat
the
people
without
funds
of
little
bit
more
carefully.
i
might
say,
i
pass
the
point
by,
i
suppose
it
may
have
been
implied
in
what
i
said
that
this
case
is
really
like
williams
in
the
critical
respect
that
the
maximum
sentence
that
can
be
provided
for
offenses
of
this
kind
is
zero
days,
which
brings
it
within
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
due
process
theory
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
amicus
curiae,
i
might
say,
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association,
which
has
come
into
this
case,
amicus
curiae
suggest
that
this
is
even
a
worst
case
than
williams,
a
more
severe
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
because
here,
you’re
not
just
adding
to
an
existing
jail
term
but
you're
substituting
jail
for
a
pecuniary
penalty.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it’s
not
clear
on
the
record.
the
maximum
that
this
court
could
impose
for
any
offense
was
$200.00.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
right.
so
1800
would’ve
been
the
presumably
the
absolute
jurisdictional
limit,
but
they
may
have
been
the
sure
the
limits
for
--.
now
there’s
another
aspect
to
this
case,
it
is
not
our
principle
point,
but
we
would
like
to
stress
it,
and
that
is
that
the
idea
of
exchanging
a
man’s
freedom
for
$5.00
a
day
strikes
us
as
being
itself
implicitly
irrational.
when
one
thinks
about
how
any
person
in
the
middle
class
or
with
comfortable
means
or
just
not
an
indigent,
would
feel
about
his
freedom
and
to
translate
that
precious
thing,
being
the
most
precious
thing
we
have
for
$5.00
seems
to
us
over
the
line.
and
of
course
the
american
bar
association,in
rather
strong
language,
in
rather
strong
language
made
a
similar
point
in
which
it
said,
i
think
it’s
on
page
12
of
our
brief
that
--
page
16,
i’m
sorry,
page
16
of
our
brief,
saying
it
even
more
strongly
than
we
did
that
the
exclusive
use
of
a
dollar
a
day
ratio
both
presents
the
possibility
of
a
brutally
long
sentence
and
provides
as
a
measure,
an
arbitrary
figure
which
makes
no
economic
sense
and
which
bears
no
relation
to
the
factors
which
ought
to
govern
the
choice
as
to
the
length
of
the
sentence.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it’s
a
rather
old
statute,
i
believe.
texas
--
a
hundred
years
ago,
120
years
or
i
think
in
1850
had
a
statute
which
provided
for
installments
of
some
kind.
it
was
repealed
i
think
in
--
well
that
the
state
will
correct
me
on
that,
but
it’s
not
a
new
statute
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
well
that’s
correct.
i
--
we’re
not
making
a
moral
judgment
on
the
legislature
of
texas
in
making
this
claim.
i
think
perhaps
notions
of
fairness
of
change
as
well
as
the
declining
value
of
the
dollar,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
one
court,
an
ohio
court
incidentally
held,
we
cite
the
case
in
that
long
footnote
on
page
16
that
$3.00
a
day
was
irrational.
we
would
say
$5.00
a
day
is
just
unacceptable
in
terms
of
fundamental
fairness
and
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
i’m
just
emphasizing
this
other
aspect
which
is
a
separate
point,
and
it
is
not
as
you
point
out
a
principle
point.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
he
could
be.
i
would
not
think
that
the
state
should
use
that
as
its
first
alternative.
i
think
they
should
follow
the
recommendations
made
by
the
american
bar
association
and
the
commission
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
did
not
mean
to
put
it
that
way.
what
i’m
suggesting
is
that
we
deal
here
with
the
deprivation
of
liberty.
it
seems
to
us
fully
consistent
with
this
court's
hearing
--
opinions
in
a
variety
of
cases
that
the
state
should
use
the
least
restrictive
means
in
enforcing
its
laws.
now
this
fellow,
as
we
discussed
earlier
happened
to
be
someone
who
was
of
a
special
kind
perhaps,
but
that
does
not
mean
he’s
an
outlaw
that
he
should
be,
you
know,
condemned
totally.
he
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
pay
it
off,
and
he
could
have
perhaps
and
this
incidentally
is
relevant
to
our
second
principle
point
and
that
is
that
the
lower
courts
in
these
cases,
we
assert
respectfully,
have
to
hold
some
kind
of
hearing.
some
kind
of
proceeding
to
find
out
what’s
happening
in
these
cases
and
they
can
not
be
just
mass
produced
justice
and
a
--
an
automatic
incarceration.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
i’d
like
to
just
reserve
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
first
of
all
that
some
of
the
catalogs
of
alleged
horrors
that
my
friend
from
texas
has
referred
to
are
really
unrealistic,
and
i
would
just
refer
the
court
rather
than
go
in
to
the
details
to
the
case
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
arthur
v.
schoonfield
which
is
the
maryland
case
that
was
back
on
remand
from
the
morris
v.
schoonfield
case,
in
which
the
three-judge
court,
there
are
only
two
judges
sitting,
the
three-judge
federal
court
reviewed
in
detail
the
new
maryland
statute
and
showed,
i
think,
very
clearly
in
that
statute
and
in
the
way
the
court
discusses
it
how
this
method
of
collection
can
work
consistently
with
williams
and
illinois
and
without
undue
burden
on
the
state.
i’m
advised
by
my
co-counsel
from
texas
that
the
p.
farm
that
was
referred
to
that
is
not
discussed
at
all
in
the
record,
is
not
really
what
--
i
had
first
thought
my
friend
from
texas
was
referring
about.
as
i
understand
it
from
texas
council
that
everyone
goes
to
the
p.
farm,
the
so
called
p.
farm,
but
the
people
who
work
there,
who
agree
to
work
get
$7.00
a
day
for
working.
now,
that’s
not
the
same
thing
as
i
was
suggesting
before,
because
what
we
were
suggesting
before
was,
absent
the
willfulness
problem
which
i
certainly
want
to
reemphasize
that
the
state
is
not
powerless
under
the
constitution
to
incarcerate
somebody
who
willfully
refuses
to
pay
the
fine.
but
absent
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it’s
the
first,
the
former.
that
we
stand
on
the
alternatives
as
discussed
in
the
williams
case.
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
that,
that
the
installment
process
is
one
process
and
the
work
process
is
another.
but
24-hour
a
day
confinement
is
not
necessary
in
the
absence
of
willfulness
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
maryland
case
and
the
maryland
statute
i
think
make
this
abundantly
clear.
another
case
recently
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
almost
unanimously
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
the
anzano
case
reaches
the
same
conclusion.
i
just
want
to
clear
up
finally
in
half
a
minute
a
timing
problem
that
may
not
been
completely
clear
and
this
is
my
final
point.
and
that
is
that
after
mr.
tate
was
convicted
and
fined
$75.00
in
1966,
as
far
as
this
record
shows
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
impeach
tate’s
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
this
point,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
until
1968
that
that
money
was
due.
his
lawyer
had
been
disbarred
and
his
lawyer
apparently
had
failed
and
this
case
also
to
perfect
the
appeal.
we
think
in
conclusion
your
honors
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i’m
not
sure
what
his
occupation
was.
he
had
some
odd
jobs,
but
i’m
not
sure
what
his
occupation
was.
mr.
norman
dorsen
what?
mr.
norman
dorsen
chrysler,
i
don’t
know
the
year?
do
you?
no?
we
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
doesn't
show
the
model?
well
i’m
just
going
to
say
in
conclusion
that
we
regard
this
case
in
the
essential
principles
as
indistinguishable
from
the
williams
case
and
we
therefore
respectfully
request
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
arising
in
texas
is
a
sequel
to
the
decisions
last
term
in
this
court
in
williams
v.
illinois
and
morris
v.
schoonfield.
it
involves
the
imprisonment
of
an
indigent
for
an
inability
to
pay
certain
fines
imposed
for
traffic
offenses.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
petitioner,
mr.
tate,
committed
several
traffic
offenses
in
1966.
these
offenses
included
driving
without
an
operator’s
license,
driving
a
car
with
expired
license
plates
and
going
through
a
red
light.
neither
alone
nor
taken
together
were
these
offenses
punishable
by
a
jail
sentence.
they
were
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
were
nine
offenses.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
there
were
three
of
those.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
know
that.
it's
probably
$10.00
or
so,
$2.00.
mr.
norman
dorsen
neither
alone,
as
i
said,
or
taken
together
were
these
offenses
punishable
by
a
jail
sentence.
petitioner
was
tried
on
two
of
the
traffic
offenses
in
1966
in
the
houston
corporation
court,
a
court
whose
jurisdiction
is
limited
by
statute
to
offenses
punishable
by
fine
alone.
he
was
convicted
on
the
two
offenses
and
fined
$75.00,
but
the
judgment
was
not
executed.
this
was
explained
by
petitioner
at
the
subsequent
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
the
ground
that
he
had
paid
a
lawyer
to
appeal
the
convictions.
in
fact,
the
lawyer
failed
to
perfect
the
appeal.
if
the
appeal
had
been
perfected,
petitioner
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
county
court
and
relieved,
at
least
temporarily,
from
the
obligation
to
pay
the
fines.
instead,
as
i’ve
said,
the
convictions
became
final,
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
petitioner
ever
knew
that
this
had
occurred.
petitioner’s
attorney
incidentally
has
since
been
disbarred
for
other
reasons.
petitioner
was
not
tried
on
the
remaining
traffic
tickets
until
august
7,
1968.
he
appeared
then
in
the
same
corporation
court,
the
court
with
jurisdiction
only
to
punish
by
fines,
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
other
charges.
the
judge
imposed
fines
which
when
added
to
those
outstanding
from
1966,
totaled
$425.00.
petitioner
being
indigent
was
unable
to
pay
the
fine.
pursuant
to
texas
statutes
and
the
houston
code,
he
was
dispatched
forthwith
to
the
houston
prison
farm
to
serve
85
days
in
jail,
or
one
day
for
each
$5.00
of
the
fine,
the
statutory
rate
in
texas.
the
relevant
statutes
are
found
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
now,
this
was
on
august
7,
1968.
on
august
28,
1968,
petitioner
commenced
a
habeas
corpus
action
and
was
released
the
same
day
on
a
bond
posted
by
a
friend.
he
had
served
21
days
and
the
unpaid
fine
was
now
$320.00
which
would
subject
him
to
64
additional
days
in
jail.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no
he
did
not
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
hearing
on
the
habeas
corpus
petition
was
held
in
the
county
criminal
court
on
august
30,
excerpts
from
the
record
of
which
appear
in
the
back
of
petitioner’s
brief,
not
in
the
brown
appendix.
the
certiorari
petition
contains
the
entire
record
of
the
habeas
corpus
petition
--
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing.
the
county
criminal
court
denied
the
habeas
corpus
petition
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
affirmed
and
the
case
then
came
here
on
certiorari.
there’s
one
further
important
factual
point
i’d
like
to
make
at
the
outset.
although
the
state
in
its
brief
seems
to
dispute
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
indigent
as
of
august
1968,
when
he
was
sent
to
jail
for
nonpayment
of
the
fine,
it
is
in
fact
perfectly
clear
from
the
record
that
the
state
had
stipulated
during
the
hearing
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition
that
petitioner
was
“poverty
stricken
and
that
his
whole
family
has
been
for
all
periods
of
time
therein,
and
probably
always
will
be.”
this
is
in
the
appendix
brief,
page
7a.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
the
reason
that
that
was
not
explored
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
the
garnishment
provisions
in
the
law
of
texas
exempt
levying
on
the
car
of
a
married
man,
so
that
car
couldn’t
have
been
used
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
he
might
have
done
that.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
the
first
thing
that
has
to
happen
is
--
if
he
has
no
money,
the
court
as
this
--
the
lower
court,
the
criminal
court
as
this
court
said
in
the
williams
case
last
year
has
several
alternatives.
one
is,
if
he
has
the
possibility
of
earning
some
money
to
stretch
out
the
fine
over
a
period
of
time.
if
that
won’t
work,
another
alternative
is
to
find
a
job
for
him
or
put
him
to
work
on
at
the
prison
farm
or
something
of
the
sort,
but
not
to
confine
him
24
hours
a
day.
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
no.
what
i
have
in
mind
there
is
what
the
a.b.a.
in
its
minimum
standards
of
sentencing
provides,
they
call
that
partial
confinement.
the
study
by
the
a.b.a.
concluded
that
in
the
case
of
the
kind
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
no,
they
do
not,
they
do
not.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
if
he
were
confined
only
for
the
purpose
of
having
him
work
out
on
a
job,
the
fine
we
suggest
would
not
be
constitutionally
offensive.
in
other
words,
if
the
man
cannot
pay,
if
it’s
clear
as
mr.
justice
marshall’s
hypothetical
put
it
that
he
wasn’t
able
to
pay,
our
first
constitutional
requirement
following
the
williams
opinion
is
that
perhaps
he
might
pay
if
the
fine
is
stretched
out
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
because
of
course
there
is
a
specific
exception
in
the
thirteenth
amendment
for
persons
convicted
of
a
crime,
but
even
more
important
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
the
state
--
we
are
not
claiming,
i
wish
to
be
perfectly
clear,
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
state
is
powerless
to
get
at
the
kind
of
person
that
mr.
marshall’s
--
that
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
referred
to.w
e
say
that
the
state
can
take
certain
action.
the
first
thing
they
should
try
to
do
is
to
use
the
installment
method.
if
that
doesn’t
work,
if
there’s
no
likelihood
that
the
installment
method
would
work,
the
kind
of
arrangements
for
working
off
the
fine
over
a
period
of
time
might
be
an
alternative.
now,
the
a.b.a.,
the
commission
to
study
the
federal
penal
code,
all
examined
this
extremely
difficult
problem
because
on
the
one
hand
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
state
should
not
be
powerless
to
proceed
against
an
individual.
on
the
other
hand,
the
underlying
principle
of
the
williams
case
as
i
understand
it
is
that
for
the
person
who
is
without
funds
to
put
him
into
jail
immediately,
which
is
what
happened
here.
there
was
no
hearing,
there
was
no
exploration
of
the
possibility
of
using
these
other
techniques,
we
say
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
court
should
deal
carefully,
to
use
the
phrase
that
mr.
justice
white
used
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
morris
case,
with
the
man
who
is
without
funds,
not
exempt
him,
not
exempt
him
because
as
i
think
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
pointed
out,
there
could
be
a
reverse
discrimination
in
the
case
of
a
person
who
is
indigent
who
won’t
be
able
to
be
proceeded
against
in
any
way
at
all,
we
are
not
claiming
that.
we’re
saying
that
if
a
man
has,
as
this
man
had,
fines
totaling
$425.00
or
whatever
the
sum
would
be
that
the
lower
court
must
deal
with
that
person
individually,
that
there
must
be
a
hearing,
this
also
is
suggested
by
the
a.b.a.
and
by
the
commission
to
reform
the
criminal
law,
and
deal
with
him
in
terms
of
his
particular
situation.
it’s
possible
in
this
case
for
example
since
he
was
getting
a
veteran’s
check
i
think
of
a
$104.00
a
month
that
he
would’ve
been
able
to
pay
out
the
fine
say
$5.00
a
week
or
something
of
this
sort.
the
infirmity
in
the
procedure
here
we’re
suggesting
is
the
immediate
transference
of
an
individual
who
is
poor
to
jail
without
exploration
of
the
various
alternatives
that
were
reviewed
in
the
williams
case.
mr.
norman
dorsen
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
dorsen
well,
he
had
a
wife
and
two
children
and
a
$104.00
a
month
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
that’s
right.
the
problem
we
have
on
this
record,
mr.
justice
marshall,
which
is
--
which
from
another
point
of
view
is
relevant
to
the
question
you’re
raising
is
that
the
trial
court
did
not
do
what
we
say
is
constitutionally
required,
and
that
is
explore
the
very
questions
that
you’re
raising.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
the
lower
courts
in
these
situations
can
not
just
take
a
person
who
hasn’t
got
the
funds
and
put
him
in
jail.
we
are
not
disputing
the
implications
of
your
question,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice.
we’re
saying
that
as
the
williams
case
said,
the
choice
is
illusory
for
a
man
without
funds.
that
does
not
mean
he
should
be
exempt.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
again
and
again
because
i
think
that’s
a
critical
factor
in
cases
of
this
kind,
but
that
the
lower
court
cannot
just
take
him
and
put
him
in
jail
that
more
is
required
by
the
constitution
to
fulfill
the
mandates
of
the
cases
cited
in
williams
and
the
philosophy
of
the
williams
case
itself
as
i
read
it.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
dorsen
well
we
would
say
in
a
case
like
that
that
the
court
should
then
hold
the
kind
of
informal
hearing
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
would
say
that’s
a
case
of
willful
refusal
to
pay
and
they
could
put
him
in
jail.
we
are
not
claiming
that
in
the
case
like
that
and
i
think
that
the
chief
justice’s
could
express
the
reserve
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
we
would
concede
that
the
willful
refusal
and
i
think
it’s
pertinent
in
that
connection
because
i’m
glad
that
became
clear
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
if
the
fine
were
only
$10.00?
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
assume
we
would
not
be.
mr.
norman
dorsen
there
might
be
such
a
tendency.
it’s
hard
to
speculate
that
what
would
happen
in
each
state.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
many
states
now
provide
for
the
kind
of
arrangement
that
we
are
suggesting
and
some
of
those
as
i
understand
it
to
have
--
have
not
changed
the
law
regarding
to
sentencing.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
other
point
which
i
think
is
related
to
your
question.
the
state
makes
much
of
the
point
and
i
think
that
perhaps
one
or
two
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
indicate
a
concern
about
it
that
this
is
a
scuff
law.
that
this
is
a
fellow
who’s
just
oblivious
to
the
normal
restrictions
that
all
of
us
would
feel
are
binding
in
connection
with
operating
a
motor
vehicle
or
a
license,
and
therefore,
perhaps
he
should
go
to
jail.
now
our
position
on
that
is
two-fold.
one
that
the
state,
as
you
suggest,
can
provide
for
jail
sentences
in
cases
of
this
kind,
repeaters,
people
who
are
chronic
violators.
the
state
of
texas,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
has
not
chosen
to
do
that.
the
second
point
i
would
--
but
we
are
emphasizing
that
that
would
be
a
perfectly
valid
mode
of
correctional
philosophy.
the
second
point
we
would
emphasize
on
this
problem
of,
to
use
the
word
the
state
uses,
the
scuff
law,
is
that
if
people
are
going
to
go
to
jail
for
being
scuff
laws,
rich
people
should
go
to
jail
as
well
as
poor
people.
that
if
a
fellow
were
a
playboy
or
a
fellow
who
had
some
money
in
one
way
or
another
and
violated
the
traffic
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
and
i
assume
there
have
been
some
people
who’ve
done
that
in
texas
as
well
as
in
new
york
and
other
states,
we
say
that
the
law
should
be
applied
equally
to
the
rich
and
the
poor.
texas
could
decide
to
put
them
in
jail.
we
are
not
at
all
disputing
that
power.
in
this
connection
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that
may
well
be.
i
would
not
to
dispute
that
as
an
original
question.
i
might
say
in
connection
--
in
terms
of
the
state’s
interest,
the
state
at
several
points
and
very
understandably
from
its
viewpoint,
suggest
that
this
would
be
terrifically
inconvenient
for
the
state
to
do,
terrifically
inconvenient
to
do
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
a.b.a.
has
suggested,
that
the
commission
to
reform
the
federal
law,
federal
criminal
code
has
suggested
that
maryland
now
does,
that
delaware
does,
that
california
does.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
--
that
the
inconvenience
problem
is
to
use
the
vernacular,
a
red
herring,
that
all
the
state
already
has
a
probation
apparatus.
it
already
has
people
who
are
concerned
with
sentencing
--
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
texas
provide
incidentally
for
installment
payments
of
fine
above
$200.00
in
another
connection.
if
you
are
fined
above
$200.00
and
there’s
a
conditions
for
probation
--
as
a
condition
for
probation,
the
court
is
in
powered
under
the
texas
criminal
code
to
provide
for
installments
that
they
don’t
--
that
the
state
doesn’t
find
that
inconvenient.
and
the
american
bar
association
which
went
through
for
all
of
this,
at
great
care,
concluded
that
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask
in
the
interest
of
equal
protection
to
treat
the
people
without
funds
of
little
bit
more
carefully.
i
might
say,
i
pass
the
point
by,
i
suppose
it
may
have
been
implied
in
what
i
said
that
this
case
is
really
like
williams
in
the
critical
respect
that
the
maximum
sentence
that
can
be
provided
for
offenses
of
this
kind
is
zero
days,
which
brings
it
within
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
due
process
theory
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
amicus
curiae,
i
might
say,
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association,
which
has
come
into
this
case,
amicus
curiae
suggest
that
this
is
even
a
worst
case
than
williams,
a
more
severe
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
because
here,
you’re
not
just
adding
to
an
existing
jail
term
but
you're
substituting
jail
for
a
pecuniary
penalty.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it’s
not
clear
on
the
record.
the
maximum
that
this
court
could
impose
for
any
offense
was
$200.00.
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
right.
so
1800
would’ve
been
the
presumably
the
absolute
jurisdictional
limit,
but
they
may
have
been
the
sure
the
limits
for
--.
now
there’s
another
aspect
to
this
case,
it
is
not
our
principle
point,
but
we
would
like
to
stress
it,
and
that
is
that
the
idea
of
exchanging
a
man’s
freedom
for
$5.00
a
day
strikes
us
as
being
itself
implicitly
irrational.
when
one
thinks
about
how
any
person
in
the
middle
class
or
with
comfortable
means
or
just
not
an
indigent,
would
feel
about
his
freedom
and
to
translate
that
precious
thing,
being
the
most
precious
thing
we
have
for
$5.00
seems
to
us
over
the
line.
and
of
course
the
american
bar
association,in
rather
strong
language,
in
rather
strong
language
made
a
similar
point
in
which
it
said,
i
think
it’s
on
page
12
of
our
brief
that
--
page
16,
i’m
sorry,
page
16
of
our
brief,
saying
it
even
more
strongly
than
we
did
that
the
exclusive
use
of
a
dollar
a
day
ratio
both
presents
the
possibility
of
a
brutally
long
sentence
and
provides
as
a
measure,
an
arbitrary
figure
which
makes
no
economic
sense
and
which
bears
no
relation
to
the
factors
which
ought
to
govern
the
choice
as
to
the
length
of
the
sentence.
mr.
norman
dorsen
it’s
a
rather
old
statute,
i
believe.
texas
--
a
hundred
years
ago,
120
years
or
i
think
in
1850
had
a
statute
which
provided
for
installments
of
some
kind.
it
was
repealed
i
think
in
--
well
that
the
state
will
correct
me
on
that,
but
it’s
not
a
new
statute
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
well
that’s
correct.
i
--
we’re
not
making
a
moral
judgment
on
the
legislature
of
texas
in
making
this
claim.
i
think
perhaps
notions
of
fairness
of
change
as
well
as
the
declining
value
of
the
dollar,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
one
court,
an
ohio
court
incidentally
held,
we
cite
the
case
in
that
long
footnote
on
page
16
that
$3.00
a
day
was
irrational.
we
would
say
$5.00
a
day
is
just
unacceptable
in
terms
of
fundamental
fairness
and
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
that’s
correct.
i’m
just
emphasizing
this
other
aspect
which
is
a
separate
point,
and
it
is
not
as
you
point
out
a
principle
point.
mr.
norman
dorsen
yes.
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
he
could
be.
i
would
not
think
that
the
state
should
use
that
as
its
first
alternative.
i
think
they
should
follow
the
recommendations
made
by
the
american
bar
association
and
the
commission
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
did
not
mean
to
put
it
that
way.
what
i’m
suggesting
is
that
we
deal
here
with
the
deprivation
of
liberty.
it
seems
to
us
fully
consistent
with
this
court's
hearing
--
opinions
in
a
variety
of
cases
that
the
state
should
use
the
least
restrictive
means
in
enforcing
its
laws.
now
this
fellow,
as
we
discussed
earlier
happened
to
be
someone
who
was
of
a
special
kind
perhaps,
but
that
does
not
mean
he’s
an
outlaw
that
he
should
be,
you
know,
condemned
totally.
he
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
pay
it
off,
and
he
could
have
perhaps
and
this
incidentally
is
relevant
to
our
second
principle
point
and
that
is
that
the
lower
courts
in
these
cases,
we
assert
respectfully,
have
to
hold
some
kind
of
hearing.
some
kind
of
proceeding
to
find
out
what’s
happening
in
these
cases
and
they
can
not
be
just
mass
produced
justice
and
a
--
an
automatic
incarceration.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
i’d
like
to
just
reserve
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norman
dorsen
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
first
of
all
that
some
of
the
catalogs
of
alleged
horrors
that
my
friend
from
texas
has
referred
to
are
really
unrealistic,
and
i
would
just
refer
the
court
rather
than
go
in
to
the
details
to
the
case
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
arthur
v.
schoonfield
which
is
the
maryland
case
that
was
back
on
remand
from
the
morris
v.
schoonfield
case,
in
which
the
three-judge
court,
there
are
only
two
judges
sitting,
the
three-judge
federal
court
reviewed
in
detail
the
new
maryland
statute
and
showed,
i
think,
very
clearly
in
that
statute
and
in
the
way
the
court
discusses
it
how
this
method
of
collection
can
work
consistently
with
williams
and
illinois
and
without
undue
burden
on
the
state.
i’m
advised
by
my
co-counsel
from
texas
that
the
p.
farm
that
was
referred
to
that
is
not
discussed
at
all
in
the
record,
is
not
really
what
--
i
had
first
thought
my
friend
from
texas
was
referring
about.
as
i
understand
it
from
texas
council
that
everyone
goes
to
the
p.
farm,
the
so
called
p.
farm,
but
the
people
who
work
there,
who
agree
to
work
get
$7.00
a
day
for
working.
now,
that’s
not
the
same
thing
as
i
was
suggesting
before,
because
what
we
were
suggesting
before
was,
absent
the
willfulness
problem
which
i
certainly
want
to
reemphasize
that
the
state
is
not
powerless
under
the
constitution
to
incarcerate
somebody
who
willfully
refuses
to
pay
the
fine.
but
absent
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i
think
it’s
the
first,
the
former.
that
we
stand
on
the
alternatives
as
discussed
in
the
williams
case.
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
that,
that
the
installment
process
is
one
process
and
the
work
process
is
another.
but
24-hour
a
day
confinement
is
not
necessary
in
the
absence
of
willfulness
to
deal
with
this
problem.
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
maryland
case
and
the
maryland
statute
i
think
make
this
abundantly
clear.
another
case
recently
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
almost
unanimously
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
the
anzano
case
reaches
the
same
conclusion.
i
just
want
to
clear
up
finally
in
half
a
minute
a
timing
problem
that
may
not
been
completely
clear
and
this
is
my
final
point.
and
that
is
that
after
mr.
tate
was
convicted
and
fined
$75.00
in
1966,
as
far
as
this
record
shows
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
impeach
tate’s
testimony
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
this
point,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
until
1968
that
that
money
was
due.
his
lawyer
had
been
disbarred
and
his
lawyer
apparently
had
failed
and
this
case
also
to
perfect
the
appeal.
we
think
in
conclusion
your
honors
that
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
i’m
not
sure
what
his
occupation
was.
he
had
some
odd
jobs,
but
i’m
not
sure
what
his
occupation
was.
mr.
norman
dorsen
what?
mr.
norman
dorsen
chrysler,
i
don’t
know
the
year?
do
you?
no?
we
--
mr.
norman
dorsen
doesn't
show
the
model?
well
i’m
just
going
to
say
in
conclusion
that
we
regard
this
case
in
the
essential
principles
as
indistinguishable
from
the
williams
case
and
we
therefore
respectfully
request
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
