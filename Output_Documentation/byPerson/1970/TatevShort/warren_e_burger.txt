chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
tate
against
short.
mr.
dorsen
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
a
constitutionally
any
less
offensive
if
he
was
only
confined
12
hours
a
day
instead
of
24?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
that
be
something
at
least
resembling
involuntary
servitude
if
the
sentence
of
the
court
was
that
he
fend
12
hours
a
day
at
the
local
prison
farm,
at
least
eight
hours
of
which
should
be
spent
working
at
$2.00
an
hour?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
the
statute
passed
in
texas?
is
it
some
statute
from
that
in
the
turn
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
you’d
agree
in
terms
of
the
economic
argument
you’re
making
that
at
the
turn
of
the
century,
$5.00
a
day
might
not
be
irrational,
might
not
have
been
irrational?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
if
you
from
your
argument
that
he
could
be
put
on
a
state
prison
farm
and
required
to
work
eight
hours
a
day
out
of
$2.00
an
hour
rate
or
something,
perhaps
something
geared
to
the
minimum
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
wages
under
the
federal
act
that
he
could
also
be
put
on
a
road
gang,
on
a
construction
job,
or
any
other
work
under
compelled
state
supervision.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
the
state
should
follow,
you’re
then
talking
in
terms
of
advice
to
the
state
legislatures.
how
can
this
court
or
any
court
give
advice
to
the
state
legislatures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
dorsen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
pursue
justice
marshall’s
question
about
installment
payments,
i
assume
texas
charges
interest
on
its
outstanding
fine,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
at
least
he
doesn’t
have
$3.00
a
month
interest
running
on
him
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
on
that
$10.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rollins,
in
the
appendix,
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
williams
last
year,
there
was
an
effort
to
summarize
what
various
states
did.
and
as
to
texas
of
course,
it
didn’t
purport
to
be
complete,
but
it
was
recited
that
he
maybe,
the
defendant
found
guilty
and
fined,
maybe
put
to
work
or
imprisoned
for
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
discharge
the
amount.
is
there
a
provision,
a
workout
provision,
under
justice
of
the
peace
fine,
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn’t
you
think
that’s
--
how
does
that
appear?
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that’s
a
rather
important
aspect
in
view
of
what
was
said
in
the
williams
case
about
alternatives,
wouldn’t
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
maybe
we
might
conceivably
take
a
different
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
professor
dorsen
didn’t
--
certainly,
he
didn’t
argue
that
there
was
anything
constitutionally
impermissible,
you
recall,
i’m
not
sure
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
necessarily
would
agree
with
that,
but
since
all
of
the
treatment
of
this
difficult
problem
has
dealt
in
terms
of
alternatives,
it’s
conceivable
that
even
at
the
rate
of
about
a
dollar
an
hour
which
texas
allows,
plus
presumably
some
food
on
a
workout
day,
you
might
have
a
different
case
from
the
case
you
have
without
that
evidence
in
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
a
8
--
$7.00
and
a
half
a
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
roughly
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
dollar
an
hour
and
i
suppose
they
give
the
man
something
to
eat
when
he’s
--
during
this
working
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
--
that
might
be
quite
a
different
case
from
the
one
you
have
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
furnish
us
with
the
memorandum
of
those
citations
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
your
friend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
we
can
judicially
notice
those
factors,
we
can’t
judicially
notice
that
the
record
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
shows
that
he
refused
to
take
this
alternative.
in
fact,
the
record
is
blank
on
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
--
was
that
before
the
texas
appellate
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
no
idea
whether
a
motion
to
supplement
the
record
would
be
granted
or
not,
but
you’re
certainly
are
free
to
make
such
a
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
referring
now
to
the
installment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dorsen.
chief
justice

e.

thank
you
