mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
we
would
like
to
discuss
what
this
case
does
not
concern.
it
does
not
concern
any
troubles
that
preston
a.
tate
that
may
have
had
with
his
lawyers.
we
think
that
this
is
not
in
the
case
nor
is
it
--
does
it
involve
any
arbitrary
action
on
the
power
of
the
state
of
texas
in
charging
$2.00
for
a
driver’s
license,
that’s
not
in
the
case.
the
case
actually
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
this
man,
preston
a.
tate,
ran
a
red
light
in
the
city
of
houston
and
the
policeman
stopped
him
and
as
part
of
their
routine
procedure,
they
asked
him
to
show
his
driver’s
license.
he
didn’t
have
a
driver’s
license.
he
went
in
to
corporation
court,
plead
not
guilty.
the
jury
found
him
$50.00
--
fined
him
50
on
one
offense,
they
could’ve
gone
at
200,
they
fined
him
25
on
the
other.
that
very
same
day
at
6
p.m.
that
evening
he
ran
a
stop
sign
and
fortunately,
a
policeman
saw
him
and
stopped
him
and
again
he
was
arrested,
and
then
subsequently
he
ran
up
a
total
of
nine
traffic
offenses.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
the
day
of
his
trial,
the
day
that
the
jury
found
him
guilty
and
fined
him
a
$50.00-fine
and
a
$25.00-fine
that
same
evening
--
the
offense
had
occurred
i
think
a
week
or
so
earlier,
but
then
on
then
on
the
day
of
his
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
--
i
doubt
it
your
honor,
because
it
was
6:30
something
p.m.,
and
i
don’t
believe
that
he
would
be
coming
home
from
the
trial,
but
nonetheless,
it
was
the
same
day.
he
ran
a
stop
sign
and
again
was
arrested,
or
given
a
ticket,
he
wasn’t
arrested
and
that
is
something
else
that
we
would
like
to
point
out
here.
they
say
that
he
was
immediately
and
forthwith
taken
to
jail.
he,
over
two
years,
expired
between
the
time
of
these
offenses
and
the
time
of
his
habeas
corpus
hearing.
and
although
he
might
have
had
a
wife
and
child
at
the
time
--
and
two
children
at
the
time
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
he
had
no
children
when
he
committed
these
offenses.
in
other
words,
there
was
enough
time
lag
in
there
for
him
to
father
two
children.
so
i
don’t
think
the
state
of
texas
has
really
been
forthwith
on
this
thing.
in
fact,
i
think
perhaps
we
could
be
--
if
we
were
to
be
criticized,
we
could
be
criticized
in
dragging
our
heels,
and
not
bringing
this
thing
to
the
head
before
now.
another
thing
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
they
question
the
jurisdiction
of
our
corporation
court
and
i
think
he
answered
his
question
when
he
stated
that
the
corporation
court
could
put
a
man
in
jail
after
he
had
failed
to
pay
his
installments.
well
now,
if
we
can
put
him
in
jail
after
failing
to
pay
the
installments,
we
could
--
we’d
have
the
jurisdiction
beforehand.
and
besides,
our
texas
supreme
court
and
texas
code
of
criminal
appeals
says
that
the
corporation
courts
and
the
jp
courts
have
the
right
to
enforce
their
orders
by
incarceration,
and
i
don’t
--
that
is
in
our
briefs,
and
i
don’t
think
that
it
would
serve
any
purpose
to
argue
that
further.
the
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
that’s
it.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
there
is
no
provision
in
our
law
for
paying
a
misdemeanor
of
this
type
out
in
installments.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
i’d
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
two
years?
i
don’t
believe,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
it
was
two
years
before
they
--
actually
what
happened
here,
they
had
some
capiases
out
for
him
on
some
of
these
other
subsequent
offenses,
and
they
finally
arrested
him.
they
finally
ran
him
down.
now
whether
we
didn’t
run
hard
enough
for
not,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
no
sir.
in
fact
he
was,
as
i
say,
and
i
was
not
on
this
case
in
the
trial
court
level,
and
i’m
not
as
acutely
familiar
with
the
facts
as
i
should
be,
but
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
about
seven
capiases
working
on
him
simultaneously.
they
were
looked
--
our
police
department
was
looking
for
him.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
seven
of
them
were
nolo
contendere,
and
two
that
the
jury
--
he
pled
not
guilty
on
two,
the
jury
found
him
guilty.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
i
don’t
know
sir.
i
don’t
--
when
a
person
gets
caught
red
handed
running
a
red
light,
i
really
don’t
see
a
much
defense.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
their
only
defense
was
that
he
was
too
poor
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir.
and
to
continue
with
justice
marshall’s
question,
i
don’t
believe
that
a
judge,
or
justice
of
the
peace
would
have
the
authority
under
our
law
to
set
up
his
own
little
time
payment
plan.
i
don’t
believe
that
when
the
law
says
that
the
fines
shall
be
collected
in
certain
manner,
i
don’t
believe
that
each
jp
in
all
of
our
many
counties
could
set
up
his
own
little
empire
so
to
speak
on
how
he’s
gong
to
collect
these
fines.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
as
far
as
the
equity
is
yes,
but
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
we
think
that
the
--
when
the
man
could
have
--
if
he
had
just
obeyed
the
law
right
there,
none
of
this
trouble
would’ve
happened,
but
he
chose
to
disobey
the
law.
he
chose
to
drive
without
a
driver’s
license
for
--
he
admitted
on
the
habeas
corpus
two-and-a-half
years
and
as
of
last
week,
he
hadn’t
got
a
driver’s
license
yet.
and
we
don’t
think
that
of
course
as
far
as
the
question
of
law
involved,
the
degree
of
a
man’s
perversity
probably
shouldn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
but
nonetheless,
it
certainly
should
be
something
that
we
should
not
be
blind
to.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
not
on
this
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
the
district
attorney
has
a
probation
department,
and
they
--
but
on
this
type
of
fine,
there
is
a
city
ordinance
which
allows
the
judge
to
delay
collection
of
the
fine
30
days
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
--
upon
application
of
the
defendant.
he
did
not
do
this.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
the
williams
case
by
the
specific
language
of
the
court,
and
i
think
at
least
ten
times
in
mr.
chief
justice
burger’s
opinion,
he
emphasized
that
what
the
court
was
condemning
in
williams
was
an
instance
where
they
had
a
statute
which
provided
for
imprisonment,
regardless.
and
in
addition
in
this
same
statute,
there
was
a
provision
for
a
fine
and
what
this
quote
said,
at
least
the
way
i
read
it
and
i
believe
that’s
what
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
schoonover
case
also
said
was
their
interpretation
of
it,
was
that
this
quote
said
that
when
you
transmute
a
fine
into
equivalent
jail
time
that
that
cannot
extend
beyond
the
maximum
jail
time
provided
in
the
statute.
that
was
what
was
before
the
court.
they
--
i
believe
you
all
said
that
you
had
a
very
limited
question,
and
that’s
what
you
decided
on,
but
i
was
impressed
by
the
number
of
times
that
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
his
opinion
kept
referring
to
that
circumscription
of
the
case
to
a
cases
where
it
extended
the
total
incarceration
period
beyond
the
period
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and
in
this
case,
this
is
a
case
where
the
only
sanction
for
a
violation
of
this
statute
was
a
fine
only.
we
submit
and
we
think
we
have
shown
it
in
our
briefs
that
in
cases
like
this
that
our
other
statutes
which
provide
that
upon
failure
to
pay
a
fine,
it
maybe
laid
out
in
jail
at
$5.00
a
day.
we
think
these
two
statutes
should
be
construed
in
para
materia.
in
other
words,
to
show
that
the
legislature
intended
that
the
man
should
not
get
off
scot-free,
but
that
if
he
would
pay
the
fine
that’s
fine.
if
he
couldn’t,
then
he
would
have
to
lay
it
out
in
jail.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
i
can
answer
that
for
the
city
of
houston,
that
we
have
an
ordinance
which
provides
that
if
he
will
go
--
voluntarily
go
to
what
we
call
our
p.
farm,
he
can
work
that
out
at
$7.50
per
day.
tate
refused
to
go
to
the
p.
farm
incidentally,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
here
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
is
that
--
was
that
in
the
habeas
corpus?
it’s
not
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
the
--
actually
as
far
as
principle
is
concerned,
i
don’t
see
that
there’s
any
difference
in
incarcerating
him
or
he
can
just
lie
around
in
jail
and
talk
to
the
boys
in
the
cell,
or
go
out
and
work
on
the
prison
farm.
it’s
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
that’s
obvious
sir.
but
you
asked
me
the
question
called,
i
can’t
see
that
the
principle
is
that
the
man
is
being
restrained
of
his
liberty
involuntarily.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
but,
i
couldn’t
understand
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
did
you
say
a
dollar
an
hour?
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
oh!
that
is
on
our
--
that’s
the
city
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
i
can
say
that
we
feed
real
good.
but
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
i
cannot
see
the
difference.
the
man
--
well,
what
would
be
the
difference
then?
and
my
answer
to
that
question
by
asking
a
question,
what
if
we
had
a
chain
gang
and
lease
the
amount
to
the
private
road
contractor
and
say
now
“if
you
go
out
here
and
work
on
this
chain
gang
out
in
the
hot
sun,
well,
we’ll
let
you
off
a
lot
sooner.”
i
can’t
see
the
difference
in
principle
and
the
idea
is
that
man
is
being
restrained
from
getting
out
in
society,
that’s
the
punishment.
and
we
believe
that
in
a
case
like
we
have
here
where
the
legislature
has
stated
that
sanction
shall
be
a
fine,
and
then
another
statute
which
we
think
ought
to
be
construed
in
para
materia
that
if
he
does
not
pay
the
fine,
then
he
has
to
go
to
jail.
we
think
that
that
is
entirely
different
and
we
would
submit,
there’s
two
early
cases
out
of
california
which
we
did
not
include
in
our
brief,
but
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court,
it’s
in
re.
wadley
in
23
pacific
190
and
in
re.
rosenheim,
23
pacific
372.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
i
certainly
will.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
and
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
in
the
wadley
case,
in
a
concurring
opinion,
mr.
justice
mcfarlane
mentioned
that
there
--
classified
the
three
types
of
sanctions
for
misdemeanor
fines:
imprisonment
only,
fine
only,
imprisonment
plus
fine.
in
in
re.
rosenheim,
there
was
a
situation
very
similar
to
the
situation
that
was
before
you
all
in
williams.
and
the
court
there,
in
the
california
court
said
that
the
language
of
the
statute
had
an
ambiguity
because
if
the
legislature
had
really
wanted
or
had
clearly
wanted
the
fine
to
be
transmuted
to
jail
time
and
added
on
to
the
imprisonment
time,
they
could
have
clearly
so
said,
but
that
they
didn’t,
and
that
the
misdemeanor
had
a
constitutional
right
for
california
to
pursue
its
policy
of
strict
construction
of
the
statute
against
the
state
and
for
the
prisoner.
in
which
case
and
they
further
stated
that
if
the
loose
construction
that
the
state
wanted
in
that
case
were
followed,
then
it
was
possible
for
a
judge
to
do
by
indirection
what
he
could
not
do
by
directly
and
i
believe
you
all
used
that
same
phrase
in
williams.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
long
before
the
times
germane
year.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor
in
texas,
city
ordinances
are
not.
our
supreme
court
or
our
district
courts
cannot
take
or
do
not
take
judicial
knowledge
of
city
ordinances.
they
do
have
city
charters.
so
in
strictly
legal
point
of
view,
i
would
presume
that
a
court
could
not
take
judicial
knowledge
of
a
city
ordinance
which
sets
up
the
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
well
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
it
is
in
our
city
code
and
if
the
supreme
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of
our
city
of
houston
code,
well
the
problem
is
solved.
and
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
if
it’s
not
in
the
record,
i
don’t
think
he
can.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
think
it
was.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
i
will
certainly
do
so.
and
your
honor,
in
what
little
time
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
protest
very
vigorously
about
this
idea
of
making
the
state
of
texas
or
city
of
houston
or
any
other
state
kind
of
adopt,
i
guess
it’s
going
to
be
something
like
the
american
automobile
association
has
for
their
subscribers.
they
go
out
and
pay
the
fines
for
you
and
its
just
all
the
part
of
the
service.
we
don’t
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
wildest
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
require
a
state
to
set
up
a
credit
card
classification
of
petty
crimes
and
misdemeanors
that
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
that’s
--
in
other
words,
that’s
what
really
what
you’re
asking
is
that
or
what
he’s
asking
is
that
the
sheriffs
and
chiefs
of
police
just
set
up
credits
with
people
like
preston
tate
and
let
him
pay
it
out
at
so
much
a
month
or
at
then
how
it’s
going
to
take
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
the
sophistication
of
a
computer
that
hasn’t
ever
been
invented
to
correlate
the
man’s
family
size,
his
personal
sensitivity,
his
--
the
value
of
his
car
which
he
has
committed
the
crimes
with
and
all
of
that
into
a
jumble
and
come
out
and
say
“alright
now,
for
you,
it’s
going
to
be
$4.75
a
week.”
and
then
does
he
propose
that
in
addition
to
having
solomon
setting
judgment
on
this
that
then
we
have
another
hearing
on
--
say
that
i
have
a
$2.00
parking
meter
violation
in
the
city
of
houston
and
i
go
down
there
say
“i’m
too
poor”
then
are
we
going
to
have
a
separate
hearing
on
my
guilt
vel
non.
and
then
another
hearing
on
whether
i
was
telling
the
truth
when
i
said
i
was
too
poor?
and
if
i
was
just
about
half
right
on
that
too
poor,
well
then
is
the
judge
going
to
have
to
figure
out
how
we’re
going
to
space
those
payments
out?
and
another
thing,
if
we
have
these
installment
payments,
the
people
are
going
to
start
getting
behind
that’s
just
human
nature
then
we’re
going
to
have
all
sorts
of
civil
rights
cases
coming
up
about
our
--
the
way
our
deputy
clerks
go
out
and
try
to
collect
the
fines
that
they
used
harsh
language.
and
we’re
going
to
--
we
think
that
this
is
just
leading
to
a
serbonian
bog
that
we
never
will
see
our
way
clear
off.
and
i
think
that
before
we
stretch
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
mean
something
that
clearly
was
not
written
in
it,
i
would
like
to
leave
in
parting
with
the
idea
that
the
poor
people
in
houston
in
texas
outnumber
the
rich.
they’ve
got
the
ballot
and
the
suffrage,
and
if
they
think
the
way
we
have
collected
their
fines
is
wrong,
they
can
elect
city
councilmen
and
state
legislators
to
change
the
law.
that
the
poor
people
of
texas
have
not
done
so
would
be
indicative
that
this
law
and
the
way
we
carry
it
out
is
not
oppressive
and
is
not
unworkable.
but
especially
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
have
the
--
and
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
that
the
same
congress
that
wrote
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
also
the
same
congress
that
passed
on
our
constitution,
and
that
we
had
to
submit
that
constitution
and
ratify
the
fourteenth
amendment
before
we
could
get
back
in
the
union.
that
same
congress
that
wrote
the
fourteenth
amendment
thought
our
state
constitution
was
all
right.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
strictly
a
matter
of
local
concern
and
that
it
would
be
beyond
the
wildest
stretch
of
imagination
to
require
the
state
of
texas
to
--
and
the
city
of
houston
to
set
up
this
installment
payment,
but
your
honors
if
you
do,
please
tell
us
exactly
how
to
work
it
because
the
district
courts
are
going
to
be
working
overtime
each
one
with
the
mutually
conflicting
subjective
idea
of
what
a
proper
installment
should
be
and
the
proper
collection
procedure
should
be.
and
i
can
see
of
all
three-man
courts
being
convened
all
over
texas
and
all
over
the
nation
for
matter,
trying
to
determine
whether
the
installment
payment
met
the
hood
cost
of
living
index
or
whether
we
should
go
on
the
guaranteed
minimum
income
as
an
index
for
fiscal
or
in
penal
responsibility.
and
then
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
add
one
thing.
what
about
the
people
that
just
won’t
pay?
we
ought
to
have
some
right
to
do
that
and
we
submit
that
it
is
our
local
--
that
this
is
within
the
province
of
our
people
and
our
legislators.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir.
the
--
a
married
man
--
a
married
man’s
automobile
is
not
subject
to
execution.
we
had
a
populist
inspired
legislature
in
the
early
1880’s
that
just
took
care
of
what
the
constitution
didn’t
take
care
of
and
if
a
man,
if
a
married
man
is
prudent
enough
in
texas
not
to
have
a
bank
account,
he
can
go
free.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
we
would
like
to
discuss
what
this
case
does
not
concern.
it
does
not
concern
any
troubles
that
preston
a.
tate
that
may
have
had
with
his
lawyers.
we
think
that
this
is
not
in
the
case
nor
is
it
--
does
it
involve
any
arbitrary
action
on
the
power
of
the
state
of
texas
in
charging
$2.00
for
a
driver’s
license,
that’s
not
in
the
case.
the
case
actually
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
this
man,
preston
a.
tate,
ran
a
red
light
in
the
city
of
houston
and
the
policeman
stopped
him
and
as
part
of
their
routine
procedure,
they
asked
him
to
show
his
driver’s
license.
he
didn’t
have
a
driver’s
license.
he
went
in
to
corporation
court,
plead
not
guilty.
the
jury
found
him
$50.00
--
fined
him
50
on
one
offense,
they
could’ve
gone
at
200,
they
fined
him
25
on
the
other.
that
very
same
day
at
6
p.m.
that
evening
he
ran
a
stop
sign
and
fortunately,
a
policeman
saw
him
and
stopped
him
and
again
he
was
arrested,
and
then
subsequently
he
ran
up
a
total
of
nine
traffic
offenses.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
the
day
of
his
trial,
the
day
that
the
jury
found
him
guilty
and
fined
him
a
$50.00-fine
and
a
$25.00-fine
that
same
evening
--
the
offense
had
occurred
i
think
a
week
or
so
earlier,
but
then
on
then
on
the
day
of
his
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
--
i
doubt
it
your
honor,
because
it
was
6:30
something
p.m.,
and
i
don’t
believe
that
he
would
be
coming
home
from
the
trial,
but
nonetheless,
it
was
the
same
day.
he
ran
a
stop
sign
and
again
was
arrested,
or
given
a
ticket,
he
wasn’t
arrested
and
that
is
something
else
that
we
would
like
to
point
out
here.
they
say
that
he
was
immediately
and
forthwith
taken
to
jail.
he,
over
two
years,
expired
between
the
time
of
these
offenses
and
the
time
of
his
habeas
corpus
hearing.
and
although
he
might
have
had
a
wife
and
child
at
the
time
--
and
two
children
at
the
time
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
he
had
no
children
when
he
committed
these
offenses.
in
other
words,
there
was
enough
time
lag
in
there
for
him
to
father
two
children.
so
i
don’t
think
the
state
of
texas
has
really
been
forthwith
on
this
thing.
in
fact,
i
think
perhaps
we
could
be
--
if
we
were
to
be
criticized,
we
could
be
criticized
in
dragging
our
heels,
and
not
bringing
this
thing
to
the
head
before
now.
another
thing
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
they
question
the
jurisdiction
of
our
corporation
court
and
i
think
he
answered
his
question
when
he
stated
that
the
corporation
court
could
put
a
man
in
jail
after
he
had
failed
to
pay
his
installments.
well
now,
if
we
can
put
him
in
jail
after
failing
to
pay
the
installments,
we
could
--
we’d
have
the
jurisdiction
beforehand.
and
besides,
our
texas
supreme
court
and
texas
code
of
criminal
appeals
says
that
the
corporation
courts
and
the
jp
courts
have
the
right
to
enforce
their
orders
by
incarceration,
and
i
don’t
--
that
is
in
our
briefs,
and
i
don’t
think
that
it
would
serve
any
purpose
to
argue
that
further.
the
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
that’s
it.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
there
is
no
provision
in
our
law
for
paying
a
misdemeanor
of
this
type
out
in
installments.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
i’d
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
two
years?
i
don’t
believe,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
it
was
two
years
before
they
--
actually
what
happened
here,
they
had
some
capiases
out
for
him
on
some
of
these
other
subsequent
offenses,
and
they
finally
arrested
him.
they
finally
ran
him
down.
now
whether
we
didn’t
run
hard
enough
for
not,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
no
sir.
in
fact
he
was,
as
i
say,
and
i
was
not
on
this
case
in
the
trial
court
level,
and
i’m
not
as
acutely
familiar
with
the
facts
as
i
should
be,
but
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
about
seven
capiases
working
on
him
simultaneously.
they
were
looked
--
our
police
department
was
looking
for
him.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
seven
of
them
were
nolo
contendere,
and
two
that
the
jury
--
he
pled
not
guilty
on
two,
the
jury
found
him
guilty.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
i
don’t
know
sir.
i
don’t
--
when
a
person
gets
caught
red
handed
running
a
red
light,
i
really
don’t
see
a
much
defense.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
their
only
defense
was
that
he
was
too
poor
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir.
and
to
continue
with
justice
marshall’s
question,
i
don’t
believe
that
a
judge,
or
justice
of
the
peace
would
have
the
authority
under
our
law
to
set
up
his
own
little
time
payment
plan.
i
don’t
believe
that
when
the
law
says
that
the
fines
shall
be
collected
in
certain
manner,
i
don’t
believe
that
each
jp
in
all
of
our
many
counties
could
set
up
his
own
little
empire
so
to
speak
on
how
he’s
gong
to
collect
these
fines.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
as
far
as
the
equity
is
yes,
but
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
we
think
that
the
--
when
the
man
could
have
--
if
he
had
just
obeyed
the
law
right
there,
none
of
this
trouble
would’ve
happened,
but
he
chose
to
disobey
the
law.
he
chose
to
drive
without
a
driver’s
license
for
--
he
admitted
on
the
habeas
corpus
two-and-a-half
years
and
as
of
last
week,
he
hadn’t
got
a
driver’s
license
yet.
and
we
don’t
think
that
of
course
as
far
as
the
question
of
law
involved,
the
degree
of
a
man’s
perversity
probably
shouldn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
but
nonetheless,
it
certainly
should
be
something
that
we
should
not
be
blind
to.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
not
on
this
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
the
district
attorney
has
a
probation
department,
and
they
--
but
on
this
type
of
fine,
there
is
a
city
ordinance
which
allows
the
judge
to
delay
collection
of
the
fine
30
days
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
--
upon
application
of
the
defendant.
he
did
not
do
this.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
the
williams
case
by
the
specific
language
of
the
court,
and
i
think
at
least
ten
times
in
mr.
chief
justice
burger’s
opinion,
he
emphasized
that
what
the
court
was
condemning
in
williams
was
an
instance
where
they
had
a
statute
which
provided
for
imprisonment,
regardless.
and
in
addition
in
this
same
statute,
there
was
a
provision
for
a
fine
and
what
this
quote
said,
at
least
the
way
i
read
it
and
i
believe
that’s
what
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
schoonover
case
also
said
was
their
interpretation
of
it,
was
that
this
quote
said
that
when
you
transmute
a
fine
into
equivalent
jail
time
that
that
cannot
extend
beyond
the
maximum
jail
time
provided
in
the
statute.
that
was
what
was
before
the
court.
they
--
i
believe
you
all
said
that
you
had
a
very
limited
question,
and
that’s
what
you
decided
on,
but
i
was
impressed
by
the
number
of
times
that
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
his
opinion
kept
referring
to
that
circumscription
of
the
case
to
a
cases
where
it
extended
the
total
incarceration
period
beyond
the
period
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and
in
this
case,
this
is
a
case
where
the
only
sanction
for
a
violation
of
this
statute
was
a
fine
only.
we
submit
and
we
think
we
have
shown
it
in
our
briefs
that
in
cases
like
this
that
our
other
statutes
which
provide
that
upon
failure
to
pay
a
fine,
it
maybe
laid
out
in
jail
at
$5.00
a
day.
we
think
these
two
statutes
should
be
construed
in
para
materia.
in
other
words,
to
show
that
the
legislature
intended
that
the
man
should
not
get
off
scot-free,
but
that
if
he
would
pay
the
fine
that’s
fine.
if
he
couldn’t,
then
he
would
have
to
lay
it
out
in
jail.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
i
can
answer
that
for
the
city
of
houston,
that
we
have
an
ordinance
which
provides
that
if
he
will
go
--
voluntarily
go
to
what
we
call
our
p.
farm,
he
can
work
that
out
at
$7.50
per
day.
tate
refused
to
go
to
the
p.
farm
incidentally,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
here
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
is
that
--
was
that
in
the
habeas
corpus?
it’s
not
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
the
--
actually
as
far
as
principle
is
concerned,
i
don’t
see
that
there’s
any
difference
in
incarcerating
him
or
he
can
just
lie
around
in
jail
and
talk
to
the
boys
in
the
cell,
or
go
out
and
work
on
the
prison
farm.
it’s
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
that’s
obvious
sir.
but
you
asked
me
the
question
called,
i
can’t
see
that
the
principle
is
that
the
man
is
being
restrained
of
his
liberty
involuntarily.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
but,
i
couldn’t
understand
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
did
you
say
a
dollar
an
hour?
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
oh!
that
is
on
our
--
that’s
the
city
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
i
can
say
that
we
feed
real
good.
but
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
i
cannot
see
the
difference.
the
man
--
well,
what
would
be
the
difference
then?
and
my
answer
to
that
question
by
asking
a
question,
what
if
we
had
a
chain
gang
and
lease
the
amount
to
the
private
road
contractor
and
say
now
“if
you
go
out
here
and
work
on
this
chain
gang
out
in
the
hot
sun,
well,
we’ll
let
you
off
a
lot
sooner.”
i
can’t
see
the
difference
in
principle
and
the
idea
is
that
man
is
being
restrained
from
getting
out
in
society,
that’s
the
punishment.
and
we
believe
that
in
a
case
like
we
have
here
where
the
legislature
has
stated
that
sanction
shall
be
a
fine,
and
then
another
statute
which
we
think
ought
to
be
construed
in
para
materia
that
if
he
does
not
pay
the
fine,
then
he
has
to
go
to
jail.
we
think
that
that
is
entirely
different
and
we
would
submit,
there’s
two
early
cases
out
of
california
which
we
did
not
include
in
our
brief,
but
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court,
it’s
in
re.
wadley
in
23
pacific
190
and
in
re.
rosenheim,
23
pacific
372.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
i
certainly
will.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
and
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
in
the
wadley
case,
in
a
concurring
opinion,
mr.
justice
mcfarlane
mentioned
that
there
--
classified
the
three
types
of
sanctions
for
misdemeanor
fines:
imprisonment
only,
fine
only,
imprisonment
plus
fine.
in
in
re.
rosenheim,
there
was
a
situation
very
similar
to
the
situation
that
was
before
you
all
in
williams.
and
the
court
there,
in
the
california
court
said
that
the
language
of
the
statute
had
an
ambiguity
because
if
the
legislature
had
really
wanted
or
had
clearly
wanted
the
fine
to
be
transmuted
to
jail
time
and
added
on
to
the
imprisonment
time,
they
could
have
clearly
so
said,
but
that
they
didn’t,
and
that
the
misdemeanor
had
a
constitutional
right
for
california
to
pursue
its
policy
of
strict
construction
of
the
statute
against
the
state
and
for
the
prisoner.
in
which
case
and
they
further
stated
that
if
the
loose
construction
that
the
state
wanted
in
that
case
were
followed,
then
it
was
possible
for
a
judge
to
do
by
indirection
what
he
could
not
do
by
directly
and
i
believe
you
all
used
that
same
phrase
in
williams.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
long
before
the
times
germane
year.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor
in
texas,
city
ordinances
are
not.
our
supreme
court
or
our
district
courts
cannot
take
or
do
not
take
judicial
knowledge
of
city
ordinances.
they
do
have
city
charters.
so
in
strictly
legal
point
of
view,
i
would
presume
that
a
court
could
not
take
judicial
knowledge
of
a
city
ordinance
which
sets
up
the
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
well
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
it
is
in
our
city
code
and
if
the
supreme
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of
our
city
of
houston
code,
well
the
problem
is
solved.
and
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir,
if
it’s
not
in
the
record,
i
don’t
think
he
can.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
your
honor,
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
think
it
was.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir,
i
will
certainly
do
so.
and
your
honor,
in
what
little
time
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
protest
very
vigorously
about
this
idea
of
making
the
state
of
texas
or
city
of
houston
or
any
other
state
kind
of
adopt,
i
guess
it’s
going
to
be
something
like
the
american
automobile
association
has
for
their
subscribers.
they
go
out
and
pay
the
fines
for
you
and
its
just
all
the
part
of
the
service.
we
don’t
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
wildest
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
require
a
state
to
set
up
a
credit
card
classification
of
petty
crimes
and
misdemeanors
that
--
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
yes
sir.
that’s
--
in
other
words,
that’s
what
really
what
you’re
asking
is
that
or
what
he’s
asking
is
that
the
sheriffs
and
chiefs
of
police
just
set
up
credits
with
people
like
preston
tate
and
let
him
pay
it
out
at
so
much
a
month
or
at
then
how
it’s
going
to
take
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
the
sophistication
of
a
computer
that
hasn’t
ever
been
invented
to
correlate
the
man’s
family
size,
his
personal
sensitivity,
his
--
the
value
of
his
car
which
he
has
committed
the
crimes
with
and
all
of
that
into
a
jumble
and
come
out
and
say
“alright
now,
for
you,
it’s
going
to
be
$4.75
a
week.”
and
then
does
he
propose
that
in
addition
to
having
solomon
setting
judgment
on
this
that
then
we
have
another
hearing
on
--
say
that
i
have
a
$2.00
parking
meter
violation
in
the
city
of
houston
and
i
go
down
there
say
“i’m
too
poor”
then
are
we
going
to
have
a
separate
hearing
on
my
guilt
vel
non.
and
then
another
hearing
on
whether
i
was
telling
the
truth
when
i
said
i
was
too
poor?
and
if
i
was
just
about
half
right
on
that
too
poor,
well
then
is
the
judge
going
to
have
to
figure
out
how
we’re
going
to
space
those
payments
out?
and
another
thing,
if
we
have
these
installment
payments,
the
people
are
going
to
start
getting
behind
that’s
just
human
nature
then
we’re
going
to
have
all
sorts
of
civil
rights
cases
coming
up
about
our
--
the
way
our
deputy
clerks
go
out
and
try
to
collect
the
fines
that
they
used
harsh
language.
and
we’re
going
to
--
we
think
that
this
is
just
leading
to
a
serbonian
bog
that
we
never
will
see
our
way
clear
off.
and
i
think
that
before
we
stretch
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
mean
something
that
clearly
was
not
written
in
it,
i
would
like
to
leave
in
parting
with
the
idea
that
the
poor
people
in
houston
in
texas
outnumber
the
rich.
they’ve
got
the
ballot
and
the
suffrage,
and
if
they
think
the
way
we
have
collected
their
fines
is
wrong,
they
can
elect
city
councilmen
and
state
legislators
to
change
the
law.
that
the
poor
people
of
texas
have
not
done
so
would
be
indicative
that
this
law
and
the
way
we
carry
it
out
is
not
oppressive
and
is
not
unworkable.
but
especially
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
have
the
--
and
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
that
the
same
congress
that
wrote
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
also
the
same
congress
that
passed
on
our
constitution,
and
that
we
had
to
submit
that
constitution
and
ratify
the
fourteenth
amendment
before
we
could
get
back
in
the
union.
that
same
congress
that
wrote
the
fourteenth
amendment
thought
our
state
constitution
was
all
right.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
strictly
a
matter
of
local
concern
and
that
it
would
be
beyond
the
wildest
stretch
of
imagination
to
require
the
state
of
texas
to
--
and
the
city
of
houston
to
set
up
this
installment
payment,
but
your
honors
if
you
do,
please
tell
us
exactly
how
to
work
it
because
the
district
courts
are
going
to
be
working
overtime
each
one
with
the
mutually
conflicting
subjective
idea
of
what
a
proper
installment
should
be
and
the
proper
collection
procedure
should
be.
and
i
can
see
of
all
three-man
courts
being
convened
all
over
texas
and
all
over
the
nation
for
matter,
trying
to
determine
whether
the
installment
payment
met
the
hood
cost
of
living
index
or
whether
we
should
go
on
the
guaranteed
minimum
income
as
an
index
for
fiscal
or
in
penal
responsibility.
and
then
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
add
one
thing.
what
about
the
people
that
just
won’t
pay?
we
ought
to
have
some
right
to
do
that
and
we
submit
that
it
is
our
local
--
that
this
is
within
the
province
of
our
people
and
our
legislators.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
g.
rollins
no
sir.
the
--
a
married
man

a
married
man’s
automobile
is
not
subject
to
execution.
we
had
a
populist
inspired
legislature
in
the
early
1880’s
that
just
took
care
of
what
the
constitution
didn’t
take
care
of
and
if
a
man,
if
a

man
is
prudent

not

he
can
go
