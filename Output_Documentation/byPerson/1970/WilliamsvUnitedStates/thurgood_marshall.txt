justice
thurgood
marshall

and
each

had
three
that’s

the
reason
in

thurgood
marshall
and
now,
at
this
point
question
arise.
the
question
to
search

do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
wherever
a
person
charge
of
a
not
colleagues
violation
is
arrested
without
a

automatically,
you
have
the
right
to
search
his
whole

without
a

justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
in
this

no
ingenuity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
see
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
was
engaged
then
the
interstate

justice
thurgood
marshall
you
see
--
justice
thurgood

i'm
interested

amendment
of
the
fourth

that
this
doesn’t
apply
in
narcotic
case.
