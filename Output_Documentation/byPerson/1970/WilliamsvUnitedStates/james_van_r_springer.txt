mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
in
the
last
case,
our
position
in
the
present
case,
the
williams
case,
is
quite
simply
that
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
because
the
evidence
in
question
was
obtained
by
a
search
that
was
legal
under
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
search
before
chimel
was
decided
and
chimel
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
so
as
to
illegitimize
that
search.
and
we
don’t
argue
here
as
we
did
in
elkanich
that
there
was
any
special
combination
of
exigent
circumstances
that
would
now
justify
the
search
without
a
warrant.
at
the
outset,
i
think
we
can
fairly
easily
dispose
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
retroactivity
question
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
search
was
reasonable
under
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
we
were
here
arguing
chimel
again,
we
would
argue
that
it
was
reasonable
mr.
justice
black.
however,
i
think
we
do
have
to
concede
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
do
concede
however
that
under
the
principle
of
chimel
if
it
applies,
we
cannot
really
justify
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
search
from
years
ago.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh,
if
i
understand
the
question
mr.
justice
black,
we
do
submit
that
there
are
circumstances
present
in
elkanich
going
to
reasonableness
under
post
chimel
standards
which
are
simply
not
there
to
be
argued
from
in
this
present
williams
case.
the
circumstances
of
the
searches
are
quite
different
in
the
two
cases
and
in
light
of
the
precedent
of
chimel
to
say
we’re
not
arguing
--
we’re
arguing
only
retroactivity
here
not
retroactive.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
certainly
mr.
justice
black,
given
the
decision
in
chimel
and
given
your
views
as
stated
in
the
linkletter
this
case
would
have
to
be
reversed.
of
course,
we
are
disagreeing
with
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
we
are
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that’s
certainly
true
and
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
the
two
cases
--
if
each
case
had
been
decided,
if
linkletter
had
been
decided
the
other
way
as
you
urge
mr.
justice
black
and
if
chimel
had
been
decided
of
the
other
way
as
you
also
urge
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
chimel
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
search,
we
would
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certain
to
be
arguing
that
this
was
a
traditional
reasonable
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
probably
so
without
having
obviously
gone
in
the
same
depth
into
the
record
in
chimel
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
case
--
the
searches
are
quite
similar
both
in
scope
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
we
would
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
we
have
frankly
not
interpreted
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
in
that
light.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
for
the
sake
of
arguments
hereafter
in
this
case,
i
think,
i'm
assuming
that
chimel
is
the
law.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
certainly
so
and
if
we
had
the
same
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
they’re
unquestionably
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
the
problem
is
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
much
like
the
chimel
case
two
years
ago.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
though
we
do
not
argue
that
there
is
such
a
difference
between
the
facts
of
chimel
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
we’ve
simply
not
taking
that
position
in
the
present
case
that
it
is
different
from
chimel
in
a
material
way.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand
mr.
justice
black
and
this
is
a
basic
principle
to
the
approach
that
the
court
has
taken,
the
majority
of
the
court
has
taken
retroactivity
cases
and
the
approach
that
we’re
here
arguing,
that
there
are
sub-principles
of
reasonableness
which
have
emerged
over
the
years
at
various
times
with
reasonable
clarity.
for
example,
we
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
not
absolute
rigid
principle
mr.
justice
black,
but
principles
nonetheless
on
which
the
police
officers
for
example
have
based
their
behavior.
for
example
the
rabinowitz
rule
that
--
if
there
is
an
arrest,
you
may
search
within
certain
limits
--
the
place
of
the
arrest.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
certainly
as
an
ultimate
principle
that
is
so,
but
it
is
certainly
is
true
that
the
precedences
are
of
some
value.
i
think
both
to
the
courts
and
particularly
to
police
officers
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
certainly
think
that
is
true,
though
of
course
there
are
substantially
some
cases
where
the
circumstances
are
substantially
the
same
as
in
others.
and
of
course
that’s
a
judging
problem
in
determining
which
circumstances
are
enough
like
others
to
lead
to
the
same
result.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice
white.
again,
because
as
i
indicated
this
search
was
very
much
like
the
chimel
search
which
the
court
in
chimel
itself
indicated
would
have
been
alright
under
the
prior
law.
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
as
mr.
florence
suggested
in
issue
as
to
the
ownership
of
this
house.
the
police
have
been
observing
williams
for
sometime
and
had
seen
him,
both
of
the
police
and
the
federal
narcotic
agents,
and
had
seen
him
come
and
go
repeatedly
from
this
house
that
hours
which
would
indicate
that
he
was
living
there
and
i
think
they
didn’t
need
to
search
the
title.
it
was
enough
to
know
that
this
was
his
apparent
residence
and
perhaps
even
that
would
be
necessary.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
--
mr.
justice
white,
we
do
not
have
to
make
that
argument
in
this
case.
of
course,
that
was
the
decision
in
the
harris
case
which
rabinowitz
had
said,
was
at
least
revived
or
continued
to
be
good
law
after
rabinowitz
and
i
think
clearly
until
the
chimel
decision
two
terms
that
go,
this
case
--
this
search
however,
was
a
considerably
more
focused
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
was
a
search
which
was
aimed
at
looking,
again
as
in
the
last
case,
from
what
currency
which
had
been
used
and
the
sale
on
which
the
arrest
was
based
and
was
in
fact
found
and
then
a
search
for
narcotics
which
also
were
found.
so,
it
was
not
a
general
exploratory
search
or
the
kind
of
mass
seizure
for
example
that
the
court
found
in
von
cleef
case
decided
at
the
same
time
as
chimel.
and
as
to
the
argument
that
the
officers
had
a
bad
motive
because
they
had
allegedly
discussed
searching
at
the
meeting,
i
think
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
was
a
factual
question
which
was
resolved
by
both
courts
below.
the
only
evidence
of
discussion
of
search
and
the
evidence
doesn’t
go
beyond
that.
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
that
the
officers
planned
the
arrest
as
a
pretext
for
a
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
the
real
explanation
and
i’m
speculating
of
course
is
that
there
were
three
jurisdictions
involved
here.
there
were
the
federal
narcotic
agents,
there
were
state
liquor
and
narcotic
agents,
and
the
local
police.
i
think
some
of
them
may
have
been
the
in
the
ease
of
cooperation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
each
of
those
jurisdiction
had
an
interest
in
this
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
that’s
i
believe
i
don’t
have
--
there
were
more
than
one
of
each
in
any
event.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
why
it
was
necessary
to
have
so
many
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
is
not.
there
are
some
suggestions
in
the
record
that
some
of
the
officers
had
more
passive
and
others
had
more
active
roles.
some
of
them
may
well
simply
have
been
standing
around
watching.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly
not
mr.
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
mr.
justice
marshall.
though
i
think
the
evidence
suggested
that
mr.
williams
was
a
substantial
narcotics
dealer.
given
the
right
and
obligation
in
fact
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
provide
against
contingencies.
they
might
well
when
they
went
to
his
house
to
come
up
against
the
substantial
number
of
people.
i
think
they
didn’t
know
what
to
expect
so
that
maybe
a
justification
what
may
seem
like
excessive
man
power
in
retrospect.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
actually
on
the
evening
of
the
arrest,
they
had
gotten
the
warrant
late
in
afternoon.
they
were
looking
for
him
all
evening,
they
traveled
around,
they
didn’t
know
where
he
was.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
though
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
admit
that
i
have
no
compelling
answer
for
that,
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
he
wasn’t
there
when
they
arrived
there.
he
arrived
while
they
were
watching
the
house.
he
might
well
have
arrived
with
a
car
full
of
confederates
for
all
that
the
agents
could
foresee.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
that
the
facts
suggest,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
i
don’t
have
the
exact
lay
out
of
the
house.
i
think
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record
he
drove
up
the
drive
way
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
the
distance
perhaps
from
you
to
me
between
the
car
and
the
house.
and
i
think,
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
the
officers
wait
until
he
got
into
the
house
and
i
think
that
probably
could’ve
done
anything
else
after
they
want
took
a
few
seconds
to
evaluate
what
had
happen
and
decide
whether
this
was
the
man
they
wanted
or
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
certainly
think
it
would
not
be
under
reasonableness
mr.
justice
black.
so,
that
this
case
does
boil
down
to
a,
i
think
a
simple
question
whether
the
chimel
should
be
retroactive
as
to
cases
that
were
on
direct
appeal
as
this
case
was
when
chimel
was
decided.
of
course,
we
think
our
situation
is
governed
by
the
court’s
express
decision
in
the
desist
case
which
was
also
a
direct
appeal
case
and
therefore,
we
think
that
a
decision
to
reverse
in
this
case
would
have
to
depend
upon
an
overruling
of
desist
which
like
this
case
was
a
fourth
amendment
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
we
do
not
as
the
court
did
not
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
desist
we
stand
on
desist
as
been
unreasonable
and
we
think
that
desist
as
desist
said
in
the
majority
opinion
reflects
appropriately
the
purpose
of
a
new
fourth
amendment
rule
such
as
the
katz
rule
or
the
chimel
rule
in
this
case
which
of
course
is
as
the
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
to
prevent
and
not
to
repair
to
court
for
service
in
the
elkanich
decision.
the
purpose
of
a
fourth
amendment
principle
is
to
deter
illegal
police
behavior,
so
that
we
think
that
in
determining
what
impact
a
rule
should
have
in
a
particular
case.
the
focus
should
be
upon
the
police
behavior
in
question.
if
in
a
rule
were
to
have
to
a
fact
on
searches
that
had
taken
place
while
the
old
rule
was
in
effect,
the
justification
and
any
kind
of
practical
terms
we
think
would
have
to
be
that
the
court
intended
to
penalize
law
enforcement
officials
for
activity
which
they
had
no
reason
to
think
was
in
the
least
bit
illegal
or
unreasonable
at
the
time
they
carried
it
out.
and
given
the
need
as
i
have
suggested
of
law
enforcement
officials
to
have
workable
rules,
almost
rules
of
thumb
that
thousands
of
policemen
and
other
officials
throughout
the
country
can
apply,
we
think
that
their
reliance
upon
such
rule
should
not
be
retroactively
punished.
in
terms
of
the
effects
on
cases,
i
think
it’s
instructive
to
consider
both
the
circumstances
of
both
to
this
case
and
of
elkanich.
if
this
search
--
the
searches
in
these
two
cases
are
held
to
have
been
unreasonable
and
their
fruits
are
excluded
from
evidence,
there
is
no
way
that
these
cases
can
be
reconstructed.
if
evidence
was
illegally
seized
there’s
no
way
that
the
police
can
--
what
i
can
think
of
that
the
police
can
after
the
fact
now
or
anytime
get
a
warrant
and
go
back
and
see
the
same
evidence
and
these
both
happened
to
be
cases
like
i
think
a
good
many
others
where
without
this
evidence
it
would
been
--
could’ve
been
very
hard
for
the
government
to
prove
its
case.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
case
where
there
is
other
proof,
there
is
the
traditional
kind
of
burden
upon
the
administration
of
justice
which
the
court
has
considered
to
be
pertinent
and
it's
other
retroactivity
cases.
the
problem
of
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it’s
awfully
hard
to
--
when
you
know
--
perhaps
in
the
situation
whether
it’s
clearly
probable
cause.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
this
case,
we
haven’t
contended
that
there
was
probable
cause.
if
there
was
probable
there
is
all
out
much
more
probable
cause
for
having
found
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
could
be
argued,
but
weren’t
--
we
haven’t
bitten
off
that
particular
point
here.
here,
the
problem
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
connecting
williams
as
narcotics
dealings
in
anyway
with
his
home.
now,
of
course
it
is
reasonable
in
narcotics
cases
and
heroine
cases
to
think
that
a
trafficker
may
well
be
keeping
narcotics
in
his
home.
i
don’t
think
we
would
abandon
the
argument
in
any
future
case
that
that
by
itself
the
fact
that
a
known
narcotics
trafficker
was
living
in
that
house
that
might
not
in
itself
be
a
basis
or
probable
cause.
we're
not
however
arguing
it
in
this
case
where
the
case
has
not
come
up
in
those
terms
through
lower
courts
i
think.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
they
had
known
that
he
was
--
well,
sale
on
which
the
arrest
warrant
was
based
was
the
9th
of
march
which
was
about
three
weeks
before
the
arrest
and
the
search.
i
think
there
is
evidence
that
at
least
the
local
police
had
been
observing
williams'
comings
and
goings
from
that
place
for
a
matter
of
months
before
that.
though,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
any
connection
between
that
house
and
the
narcotics
dealings
though
they
were
familiar
with
the
fact
that
he
lived
there.
we
suggest,
therefore,
that
the
court
should
stand
by
its
conclusion
that
the
rational
cut
off
point
in
any
search
and
seizure
case
at
least
for
retroactivity
purposes
is
the
date
of
the
police
activity
which
the
new
rule
determines
to
be
illegal.
i
think
upon
analysis
this
turns
out
to
be
the
most
rational
fairest
cut
off
point
that
could
be
evolved.
to
be
sure,
it’s
been
suggested
that
turning
down
a
man
whose
case
was
on
direct
review
at
the
time
the
new
rule
was
laid
down,
is
in
a
sense
unfair
to
him
because
one
man
who
comes
to
this
court,
one
day
he
gets
relief
and
a
man
who
comes
to
the
court
in
the
same
posture
the
next
day
does
not.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don’t
think
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
man
who
came
the
day
before
for
chimel
did
for
example,
should
be
given
relief
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
this
court
at
about
the
same
time
as
chimel,
and
of
course
he
is
penalized
perhaps
because
his
lawyer
or
if
he
had
one
didn’t
draft
his
petition
perhaps
as
artistically
has
chimel
did
or
for
some
reason
or
other
the
court
happen
to
take
a
wider
case
rather
than
an
earlier
one.
also,
i
think
it
has
to
be
now
recognized
that
how
long
a
particular
case
remains
pending
on
direct
review
is
the
product
of
a
number
of
factors
which
don’t
necessarily
reflect
upon
fairness.
a
more
affluent
defendant
or
a
defendant
with
a
less
responsible
lawyer
may
have
more
or
less
a
better
or
worse
lawyer
depending
on
the
circumstances
may
have
for
one
reason
or
another
kept
this
case
alive
on
direct
review
with
arguments
that
have
nothing
to
do
perhaps
with
the
new
rule
to
which
he
becomes
the
beneficiary
just
because
perhaps
his
case
had
been
kept
alive
on
the
basis
of
arguments
that
might
been
criminally
frivolous.
and
of
course,
the
states
of
--
the
dockets
of
the
various
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
around
the
country,
again,
are
--
these
factors
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
fairness
of
whether
one
defendant
should
be
in
jail
or
another
one
should
be
out.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
it
did
to
the
court
in
desist
that
the
fairest
most
rational
dividing
point
is
the
date
of
the
activity
upon
which
the
new
rule
focuses
and
if
the
new
rule
focuses
upon
pre-trial
investigatory
activity
as
many
of
the
new
rules
the
court
has
considered
to
the
cut
off
date
should
be,
the
date
of
the
activity
and
that
was
carried
out
in
reliance
on
the
old
rule.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
does
mr.
justice
blackmun.
of
course
that
i
believe,
i
think
that
the
--
and
some
justices
at
least
if
not
the
court
have
suggested
that
any
new
rule
could
be
made
wholly
perspective.
there’s
at
least
no
constitutional
barrier
to
doing
that,
though
as
the
opinion
in
stovall
against
denno
which
considered
this,
suggested
there
maybe
i
think
or
a
jurisprudential
reasons
for
not
doing
that
and
that’s
the
problem
of
simple
incentive
of
lawyers
to
bring
cases
raising
new
principles
to
the
further
consideration,
that
the
court
has
over
the
years
considered
that
its
decision
are
best
made
when
they
are
required
and
made
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
a
particular
record.
i
think
it
is
a
little
harsh
and
rigid
to
say
that
because
the
court
has
chosen
not
to
make
new
law
in
that
wholly
perspective
way
that
it
must
therefore
give
relief
to
everybody
whose
case
was
on
direct
review
either
in
this
court
or
some
other
court
at
the
time
of
the
new
decision.
because
and
as
i’ve
suggested
that
in
terms
of
the
practicalities
and
in
terms
of
the
hundreds
or
thousands
defendants
who
are
in
prison
around
the
country,
that
is
not
a
very
fair
or
i
would
submit
rational
dividing
line.
i
might
just
say
a
word
about
the
point
that
both
mr.
florence
and
the
petitioner
in
elkanich
raised
as
to
what
the
government
says,
the
principle
is
upon
which
the
court
should
determine
whether
there
is
a
retroactivity
question
or
not.
i
think
it’s
not
a
fair
reading
of
our
argument
to
say
that
we
have
concoctive
the
magical
term
landmark
and
that
it’s
only
landmark
cases
which
are
not
--
we
argue
would
not
be
a
retroactive.
i
think
that
the
question
whether
there
is
a
retroactivity
question
which
may
in
some
cases
be
a
hard
one,
though,
i
don’t
think
it
is
here
has
to
be
made
in
terms
of
the
practical
question
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
change
in
the
rules
by
which
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
for
example,
police
behavior
has
been
molded
and
could
reasonably
be
molded
or
in
the
case
of
matters
occurring
at
trial
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
change
in
a
rule
that
has
been
used
for
the
guidance
of
trial
courts.
i
think
in
each
case
as
all
of
these
retroactivity
considerations
that
must
considered
in
terms
of
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
without
anticipating
here
the
argument
in
the
next
case
which
i
also
be
doing
for
the
government,
the
williams
case.
it
may
be
helpful
to
take
a
minute
at
the
outset
to
outline
the
issues
that
are
in
this
pair
related
cases
in
the
government’s
position
and
presentation
in
each
of
them.
the
present
case
the
elkanich
case
can
we
think
the
affirmed
on
either
of
two
browns
and
i
think
mr.
miller
has
acknowledged
that
at
least
to
the
formal
letter.
first
of
the
search
which
happen
long
before
chimel
was
valid
under
pre-chimel
standards
and
chimel
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
here
on
plenary
review.
and
second,
that
even
a
part
from
that
even
assuming
that
chimel
did
apply.
the
search
in
this
case
would
be
consistent
with
the
principles
of
chimel
in
view
of
the
conglomeration
of
special
circumstances
that
i
will
discuss
in
a
couple
of
minutes.
in
the
next
case,
the
williams
case,
we
similarly
argue
that
the
search
was
valid
under
the
pre-chimel
standards
enforced
when
the
cert
was
made.
the
williams
contest
that
proposition
as
i
think
its
fair
to
say,
elkanich
does
not
but
we
do
not
argue
that
the
william
search
would
be
valid
that
if
it
had
taken
place
after
chimel.
accordingly,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
williams
judgment
on
the
sole
ground
of
nonretroactivity
of
chimel.
now
on
this
retroactivity
issue
that’s
common
to
the
two
cases.
they
differ
in
that
as
i’ve
indicated
chimel
--
elkanich
comes
here
on
collateral
review
whereas
williams
is
here
on
direct
review
of
the
conviction
and
was
in
fact
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
chimel
was
decided.
for
reasons
that
i
would
go
into
my
argument
in
the
next
case,
we
think
that
makes
no
difference
since
the
crucial
dividing
point
for
retroactivity
purposes
should
be
the
date
of
the
search
as
the
court
held
in
desist.
my
argument
on
retroactivity
in
the
present
case
will
be
a
simpler
one
presents
in
order
to
prevail
on
that
issue.
i
think
elkanich
would
have
to
convince
the
court
that
chimel
should
be
fully
retroactive
without
regard
to
the
more
delicate
questions
of
dividing.
but
before
i
go
into
the
retroactivity
question
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
our
proposition
that
the
search
of
elkanich’s
apartment
was
under
all
the
circumstances,
one
that
would
be
valid
even
if
it
were
carried
on
today.
this
is
a
very
important
proposition
for
the
government
and
we
asserted
here
just
as
strenuously
as
we
do
the
nonretroactivity
point
even
though
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
reach
it
depending
on
how
the
court
decides
the
case.
on
the
search
question,
we
start
with
the
premise
which
is
not
contested
that
this
was
a
search
made
pursuant
to
a
valid
arrest
without
a
warrant.
in
fact,
the
validity
of
the
arrest
was
the
question
that
was
litigated
on
direct
review
in
1963,
1964.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
ample
probable
cause
to
arrest
elkanich
in
his
apartment.
this
court
denies
certiorari
and
as
i
indicated,
i
think
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
validity
of
arrest
here
on
collateral
review.
we
acknowledge
however,
that
the
search
of
the
apartment
of
elkanich’s
apartment
was
more
extensive
than
what
chimel
indicated,
would
routinely
be
appropriate
as
an
instant
to
an
arrest
without
a
search
warrant
in
the
future.
it
is
not
simply
a
search
without
commit
himself
and
the
area
within
his
immediate
control
where
he
could
obtain
weapons
or
destructible
evidence.
we
acknowledge
this
was
a
search
by
several
narcotics
agent
and
at
least
two
of
the
three
rooms
of
elkanich’s
small
apartment
and
then
it
went
on
for
some
time
as
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
it’s
that’s
a
little
unclear.
the
agents
were
there
roughly
an
hour.
the
record
suggests
that
they
spent
a
good
deal
at
time,
trying
to
persuade
the
elkanich
to
cooperate
with
them
and
reveal
his
sources.
so,
it’s
hard
to
re-establish
exactly
how
many
agents
spent
how
long
searching
through
things.
we
do
admit
though
that
it
was
a
search
of
some
scope
and
time.
the
products
of
the
search
which
were
introduced
in
evidence
were
merely
two
things.
marked
currency
which
was
found
in
the
kitchen
closet
and
a
plastic
bag
which
was
found
in
the
living
room
closet;
and
which
was
similar
to
the
plastic
bag
that
have
been
used
in
some
of
the
sales
of
narcotics,
sales
of
heroin
that
were
involved
in
the
trial.
but
as
i
indicate,
we
believe
that
the
combination
of
special
circumstances
here
did
make
the
search
reasonable
without
--
and
that
the
search
therefore
should
not
be
judge
solely
by
the
standards
established
in
chimel
as
to
routine
searches
pursuant
to
arrest.
this
was
not
routine
search.
we
think
that
there
were
really
three
exceptional
factors
here.
first,
we
think
the
record
shows
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
relatively
narrowly
focus
search
in
terms
of
what
the
agents
apparently
were
looking
for
and
what
they
found
would
actually
occurred
here.
second,
there
was
a
real
danger.
we
think
the
record
shows
that
agents
did
not
search
the
apartment
when
they
did
when
they
went
there
to
arrest
elkanich.
the
evidence
they
reasonably
expected
to
find
in
the
apartment
would
be
removed
or
destroyed.
and
third
and
i
think
most
important
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
some
of
the
others
that
have
been
mentioned.
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
the
arrest
had
brought
the
agents
to
the
apartment
with
such
genuine
urgency
that
it
was
not
reasonably
practicable
for
them
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
even
though
we
think
they
could
have
if
they
had
have
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though,
i
think
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though,
i
think
on
examination
of
the
opinion
in
vale.
the
court
went
to
the
majority
went
to
some
pains
to
point
out
that
that
was
not
a
case
where
it
was
impracticable
to
get
a
search
warrant.
so,
on
this
third
point
which
i
emphasized
because
i
think
it
is
a
more
unique
point.
i
think
vale
does
not
by
any
means
foreclose
that.
that
the
vale
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
time.
i
think
there
was
an
arrest
warrant
there,
that
there
was
time
to
get
a
search
warrant.
now,
there
may
have
been
some
--
some
factual
disputes
as
i
guess
vale
was
characterized
by
a
good
deal
of
factual
dispute.
but
at
least
those
with
the
terms
in
which
the
majority
decided
that
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
will
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
will
get
to
the
facts
which
i
think.
i
hope
to
do
before
the
lunch
break.
of
course
as
i
indicate,
we
are
not
rearguing
chimel
here
even
though,
that
the
dissenters
in
that
case
believe
that
the
first
two
of
the
factors
probable
cause
and
danger
of
loss
of
evidence
were
present
there.
again,
i
think
this
case
is
different
from
that
because
of
this
third
factor
and
in
fact
the
chimel
rule
that
the
statement
of
the
rule
in
the
majority
opinion
does
not
really
focus
on
the
two
factors
of
probable
cause
and
danger
of
loss
of
evidence
that
the
dissenters
pointed
out.
so,
i
think
chimel
has
to
be
read
as
stating
the
rule
for
a
routine
search
pursuant
to
an
arrest.
this
brings
me
then
to
the
circumstances
that
we
think
made
it
impracticable
to
obtain
a
warrant
and
this
will
require
me
to
state
the
facts
of
the
case
and
considerable
more
detail
than
the
petitioner
did.
this
case
involved
three
sales
of
heroin
by
a
man
named
rios
to
an
undercover
agent
totaling
about
60
grams
and
these
three
sales
were
over
the
period
of
a
week
in
the
summer
of
1962.
one,
the
first
sale
was
july
13th
and
then
there
were
two
more
on
july
18th
and
19th.
each
time
the
intermediary
rios
was
given
marked
currency
by
the
undercover
agent.
he
went
away
and
came
back
with
the
heroin
which
suggested
of
course
that
he
was
obtaining
it
from
then
unknown
third
party.
rios
was
arrested
on
the
afternoon
very
shortly
after
the
last
of
these
sales
on
july
19th.
on
his
person,
he
had
two
keys
and
an
address
book.
when
questioned
that
afternoon
about
his
source
of
supply,
he
would
say
only
that
it
was
a
chinese
seaman
name
charlie.
it
was
no
--
unable
to
get
anymore
information
than
this
from
rios,
the
undercover
agent
mr.
lang,
testified
that
he
spent
the
evening
of
july
19th
testing
the
keys
he
had
found
in
an
apartment
house
where
apparently
he
had
some
reason
to
suspect
the
keys
might
belong
that
was
unsuccessful.
the
case
began
to
break
on
the
afternoon
of
july
20th,
the
next
day,
when
rios
became
a
bit
more
talkative
maintaining
his
story
about
the
chinese
seaman
named
charlie.
but
admitting
with
the
keys
where
to
room
30
of
a
place
called
the
marlow
hotel.
this
in
fact
was
a
place
where
lang
had
seen
rios
go
from
across
the
street
apparently
to
obtain
the
heroin
that
he
bought
from
him
at
the
first
sale
on
july
13th.
so,
that
marlow
hotel
rang
a
bell
in
lang’s
mind
base
on
his
own
observation
of
that
sale.
almost
immediately
lang
still
the
same
afternoon.
in
fact,
all
of
the
events
of
this
case
through
the
search
take
place
over
a
period
of,
perhaps,
three
or
four
hours
between
sometime
in
the
afternoon
which
had
been
flared
from
the
record
and
about
6
p.m.
when
the
search
took
place.
lang
as
i
say
went
promptly
to
the
hotel
to
check
what
rios
had
told
them
about
the
keys.
he
found
out
from
the
manager
of
the
hotel
that
on
july
13th
which
was
the
night
when
presumably
room
30
had
been
used
in
connection
with
this
sale.
room
30
had
been
rented
not
to
any
chinese
but
to
a
person
who’d
signed
his
name
as
joseph
elkanich,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
manager
describer
him
considerable
detail
and
said
that
the
she’d
been
little
suspicious
because
the
evidence
that
had
indicated
the
next
morning
when
he
hadn’t
slept
in
the
room.
lang
then
went
right
back
to
the
narcotics
headquarters
which
i
presume
i
gather
all
of
these
locations
are
in
fairly
close
proximity
to
each
other
since
the
rent
seem
to
move
quite
quickly.
there
he
looked
up
the
files
on
elkanich
found
that
he
had
been
involved
in
smuggling
of
heroin
from
orient
in
the
past.
he
had
some
other
matters
to
attend
to
in
court
that
afternoon
but
as
soon
as
he
could,
he
obtained
pictures
of
elkanich
from
the
san
francisco
police.
we
discover
he’d
had
him
had
arrested
him
and
it
served
some
time
on
a
local
robbery
i
believe
conviction.
but
he
take
pictures
from
them
then
he
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
verified
with
the
hotel
clerk
that
these
pictures
look
like
the
man
who
had
rented
room
30
on
july
13th,
the
night
of
the
first
sale.
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
at
this
point
and
probably
at
this
point
for
the
first
time
probable
cause
to
go
after
elkanich
had
emerged.
elkanich
was
tied
quite
clearly
to
the
place
where
apparently
the
narcotics
had
been
obtained
from
and
it
was,
perhaps
at
least
reasonable
to
suspect
that
elkanich
had
also
been
the
source
for
the
two
other
sales
within
the
very
short
period
of
a
few
days
that
rios
had
made
to
the
agent.
having
suddenly
discovered
that
elkanich
seem
to
be
the
man.
it
was
a
matter
of
considerable
urgency
to
the
police
to
the
narcotics
agents
to
go
after
him.
rios
had
obviously
made
efforts
to
conceal
his
source
of
supply
and
he
had
the
police
discovered
then
had
access
as
mr.
miller
mention
to
a
telephone
at
the
county
jail
where
he
was
being
held.
i
don’t
suppose
that
the
urgency
depends
on
what
he
might
have
done
after
that
point.
he
might
already
--
he
might
well
already
have
tipped
elkanich
off
and
elkanich
might
be
packing
to
leave
town
or
whatever.
so,
it
seemed
to
them
that
it
was
quite
urgent
to
pursue
elkanich
as
properly
as
they
could.
and
in
addition,
assuming
that
there
had
been
substantial
dealings
between
elkanich
and
rios,
elkanich
might
without
regard
any
telephone
call
had
suddenly
discovered
that
his
intermediary
was
missing.
so,
that
in
any
event
the
police,
the
agent
felt
and
i
think
in
good
faith
and
was
substantial
justification
that
they
should
find
this
man
as
soon
as
they
could.
in
fact,
they
proceeded
very
promptly
to
do
so.
they
check
with
the
telephone
company
by
subpoena
and
discovered
that
he
had
an
armless
to
telephone
having
listed
an
apartment
at
the
address,
in
fact,
the
apartment
where
he
was
where
they
went
to
find
him
and
arrested
him
and
searched.
in
addition,
they
found
in
the
notebook
which
rios
should
have
on
its
person
when
he
was
arrested,
a
notation
of
the
telephone
number
from
a
man
referred
to
as
joe.
this
telephone
number
was
the
telephone
number
that
they
had
found
from
the
dope.[lunch

mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
lunch
hour,
we
left
off
at
the
verge
of
the
trip
by
the
agents
to
elkanich's
apartment
where
they
arrested
and
searched.
at
that
point,
it
was
about
5:45
on
the
same
afternoon
that
leads
to
that
--
led
to
the
focus
on
elkanich
first
came
to
the
agents’
attention.
and
as
i
indicated
that
the
agents
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
they
should
pursue
elkanich
with
this
much
urgency
as
they
could.
at
this
time
at
5:45
in
the
afternoon,
agent
lang
who
was
handling
the
matter
principally
did
try
to
reach
the
united
states
commissioner;
he
was
unable
to
do
so.
in
any
event,
i
think
under
the
circumstances
as
that
it
might
have
been
imprudent
even
if
the
commissioner
was
right
on
hand
perhaps
to
take
the
time
for
the
mechanical
and
secretarial
work
of
preparing
papers
looking
toward
a
search
warrant.
but
in
any
event,
they
were
unable
to
find
the
commissioner
and
accordingly,
lang
and
two
other
agents
preceded
immediately
to
elkanich's
apartment
where
they
arrested
him
and
made
the
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well
that
really
leaves
me
into
another
factor.
i
think
under
these
circumstances,
it’s
fair
to
say
there
was
nothing
reasonable
they
could
do
to
freeze
the
status
in
the
apartment
pending
efforts
to
get
a
search
warrant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
for
example
there's
that
we
conceive
really
in
the
next
case,
in
the
williams
case,
there's
a
good
deal
of
difference.
there,
there
was
an
arrest
warrant.
the
arrest
was
made
on
the
basis
of
a
sale
of
narcotics
that
were
some
three
weeks
before
the
arrest.
i
think
that
kind
of
case
is
probably
also
quite
typical
of
narcotics
cases
where
sale
is
made
but
the
agents
hold
off
making
an
arrest
before
a
certain
period
of
time
which
of
course
can’t
go
too
far
while
they
try
to
find
sources
of
supply
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
the
difference
in
this
case
as
i
tried
to
show
in
the
facts
i
stated
is
that
the
case
broke
very
quickly
under
circumstances
where
there
were
good
grounds
to
believe
that
they
wouldn’t
be
able
to
find
the
man
they
were
looking
for
unless
they
went
for
him
promptly
and
then
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
they
didn’t
know
they
were
looking
for
and
until
i
don’t
how?
until
a
relatively
few
minutes
before
they
could
get
the
information
from
a
telephone
company
and
then
go
on
to
his
apartment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
they
didn’t
know
the
identity
of
the
man
they
were
looking
for
until
that
same
afternoon.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
so
though
there
is
an
additional
fact
when
we
get
into
it
but
danger
of
lost
of
evidence.
if
he
were
an
interstate
theft
of
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
television
sets
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
i’m
sure
of
course
there
are
additional
factors.
this
is
exigency,
the
impracticability
of
getting
a
search
warrant.
there's
also
the
fact
that
we
submit
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
look
for
the
specific
items
they
were
looking
for
and
there
were
circumstances
where
there
was
a
serious
danger
that
the
evidence
would
disappear;
and
it
was
impracticable
for
them,
unreasonable
in
fact
for
them
to
seal
off
the
area
where
the
evidence
might
be
until
they
can
a
search
warrant.
this
was
because
the
apartment
had
another
occupant
who
has
been
described
as
elkanich’s
common
law
wife
but
apparent
she
in
any
event
she
lived
there.
she
had
certain
rights
in
the
premises
since
it
was
narcotics
heroin
that
was
in
question
which
of
course
a
very
small
item,
the
only
way
that
the
agents
could
have
guarded
against
the
risk
that
the
evidence
would
disappear
or
be
flushed
down
the
toilet
or
something
like
that.
it
would
have
been
to
supervise
and
watch
this
ms.
egan’s
activities
very
closely.
i
think
under
circumstances
where
she
would
impractical
terms
had
been
virtually
under
arrest
until
they
could
get
a
search
warrant.
of
course
they
had
no
basis
for
restricting
her
freedom
in
that
way
or
they
could
have
excluded
her
from
the
apartment.
but
again
that
was
a
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
don’t
think
the
record
shows
anything.
i
mean
to
say
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not
as
far
as
the
record
shows.
it’s
a
--
i'm
not
sure
where
the
information
comes
from
that
she
will
a
common-law
wife.
but
anyway,
she
was
apparently
living
there.
she
was
present
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
she
was
present
in
the
apartment.
in
fact,
she
opened
the
door
to
let
the
agents
in.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
i
certainly
think
so
mr.
justice
black
and
it
was
i
think
entirely
proper
for
the
agents
to
have
considerable
concern
for
her
freedom
and
her
rights
to
go
on
living
in
her
apartment.
so,
then
to
the
circumstances,
i
think
the
search
considering
the
rights
of
both
of
parties
was
considerable
less
of
intrusion
than
an
attempt
to
freeze
the
situation
pending
efforts
to
get
a
warrant.
i
might
also
just
review
the
circumstances
that
we
think
made
for
the
additional
factor
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search.
in
other
words,
they
could
have
been
a
warrant
had
there
been
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
black
and
at
first
as
i
indicated
there
had
been
a
reasonable
identification
of
elkanich
as
the
source
of
the
narcotics
that
the
agent
had
bought
from
the
intermediary
rios.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that’s
certainly
so
mr.
justice
black.
though
there
are
of
course
over
the
years
they
have
developed
different
focuses
aspects
of
the
reasonableness
aspect.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
we
would
submit
of
course
that
under
special
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here.
it
should
be
open
despite
chimel
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that’s
exactly
one
mr.
justice
black
and
we
think
that
the
chimel
cannot
be
read
as
an
absolute
rigid
rule
as
to
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
by
way
of
search
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
according
that
we
say
this
additional
factors
here
highly
as
pungent.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
certainly
does
though
of
court
when
you
talk
about
trailer
truck,
you
may
get
into
the
vehicle
search
kind
of
situation
which
is
perhaps
a
different
category.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
well
without
as
i
indicate
the
very
serious
intrusions
upon
the
other
occupant
of
the
apartment.
i
think
of
a
further
factor
in
addition
to
the
three,
the
exigency,
the
probable
cause
and
the
danger
of
losing
the
evidence.
i
think
it
is
pertinent
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
a
search
at
the
time
of
arrest.
the
fact
that
there
is
an
arrest,
does
mean
that
the
defendant
will
quite
shortly
be
brought
before
magistrate
and
quite
shortly
have
a
lawyer
appointed
to
protect
him.
so,
its
--
i
think
the
context
in
which
this
occurs
is
somewhat
different
from
the
context,
where
their
might
not
be
with
few
minute
safeguards
that
arise
out
of
the
arrest
situation.
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
some
analogy
though
i
don’t
want
to
press
it
too
far
between
the
decision
last
term
in
chambers
against
maroney,
where
in
connection
with
the
vehicle
search,
the
two
factors
of
probable
cause
and
the
danger
of
loss
to
the
evidence
were
regarded
as
enough
without
either
an
arrest
or
perhaps
at
least
so
clearly
the
notion
of
impracticability
of
getting
a
warrant.
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
retroactivity
questions
that
have
been
raised
by
the
petitioner
here.
as
i
indicated
what
i
said
so
far
has
assumed
what
we
argue
not
to
be
the
case
but
the
chimel
governs
this
case.
i
emphasized
again
that
this
case
elkanich
is
a
collateral
review
case
since
the
search
took
place
in
1962
and
the
conviction
became
final
in
1964
so
that
in
order
to
prevail
the
petitioner
would
have
to
convince
the
court
of
the
chimel
rule
should
be
fully
retroactive.
its
principle
point
of
course
is
that,
i
guess
he
argues
that
we
don’t
have
a
retroactivity
case
here
because
chimel
was
not
the
kind
of
change
in
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
which
invokes
a
retroactivity
problem.
but
i
think
its
simplicity
at
least
in
what
mr.
miller
said
that
he
believes
that
if
we
do
have
a
retroactivity
problem
here
the
principles
of
desist
and
in
fact
all
of
the
court’s
cases
since
linkletter
in
1965
indicate
that
this
case
should
not
be
governed
by
chimel.
i
think,
the
first
place
to
look
in
determining
whether
chimel
is
a
kind
of
change
in
the
law
that
creates
a
retroactivity
problem
is
the
chimel
opinion
itself,
where
the
court
discuss
the
prior
law
at
some
length,
and
said
clearly
that
the
rabinowitz
case
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“has
come
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
warrantless
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
may
generally
extend
the
area
that
is
considered
to
be
in
the
possession
or
under
the
control
of
the
person
arrested.”
and
added
another
point
the
court
says,
the
rationale
that
allowed
the
searches
and
seizures
in
rabinowitz
and
harris
would
allow
the
searches
and
seizures
in
this
case.
chimel
involved
the
search
of
an
entire
three-bedroom
house
by
three
officers
that
went
on
for
a
good
part
of
an
hour.
rabinowitz
involved
a
meticulous
search
of
all
of
the
drawers
and
cabinets
of
an
office
that
went
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
harris
was
a
five-hour
search
of
a
four-room
apartment.
all
of
these
searches
were
i
think
considerably
more
elaborate
than
the
search
in
this
case
and
so,
i
think
the
--
it
was
contemporary
standards
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
search
as
express
explicitly
by
this
court
in
its
decisions
continued
to
be
good
law.
petitioner
suggest
that
any
policeman
worthy
of
the
name,
to
use
this
phrase,
should
have
noticed
some
years
before
chimel
that
this
court
had
lost
enthusiasm
for
the
rabinowitz
rule
and
therefore
should
have
seized
relying
on
it
as
a
guide
for
their
investigatory
work,
i
think
that’s
unrealistic.
in
1962
as
a
matter
of
fact,
though
as
petitioner
suggests
without
enthusiasm,
this
court
relied
on
the
rabinowitz
case
and
the
abel
case.
considering
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
rules
of
primary
behavior
by
police
officers
who
i
think
have
to
be
able
to
carry
on
their
work
with
some
degree
of
certainty
and
simplicity
as
to
rules.
i
think
that
it’s
simply
unrealistic
to
say
that
the
police
were
not
entitled
to
rely
upon
rabinowitz
rule
in
1962
or
for
that
matter
in
1964
when
the
conviction
began
final
here.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
in
the
last
case,
our
position
in
the
present
case,
the
williams
case,
is
quite
simply
that
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
because
the
evidence
in
question
was
obtained
by
a
search
that
was
legal
under
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
search
before
chimel
was
decided
and
chimel
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
so
as
to
illegitimize
that
search.
and
we
don’t
argue
here
as
we
did
in
elkanich
that
there
was
any
special
combination
of
exigent
circumstances
that
would
now
justify
the
search
without
a
warrant.
at
the
outset,
i
think
we
can
fairly
easily
dispose
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
retroactivity
question
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
search
was
reasonable
under
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
we
were
here
arguing
chimel
again,
we
would
argue
that
it
was
reasonable
mr.
justice
black.
however,
i
think
we
do
have
to
concede
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
do
concede
however
that
under
the
principle
of
chimel
if
it
applies,
we
cannot
really
justify
this
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
search
from
years
ago.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh,
if
i
understand
the
question
mr.
justice
black,
we
do
submit
that
there
are
circumstances
present
in
elkanich
going
to
reasonableness
under
post
chimel
standards
which
are
simply
not
there
to
be
argued
from
in
this
present
williams
case.
the
circumstances
of
the
searches
are
quite
different
in
the
two
cases
and
in
light
of
the
precedent
of
chimel
to
say
we’re
not
arguing
--
we’re
arguing
only
retroactivity
here
not
retroactive.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
certainly
mr.
justice
black,
given
the
decision
in
chimel
and
given
your
views
as
stated
in
the
linkletter
this
case
would
have
to
be
reversed.
of
course,
we
are
disagreeing
with
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
we
are
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that’s
certainly
true
and
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
the
two
cases
--
if
each
case
had
been
decided,
if
linkletter
had
been
decided
the
other
way
as
you
urge
mr.
justice
black
and
if
chimel
had
been
decided
of
the
other
way
as
you
also
urge
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
chimel
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
search,
we
would
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certain
to
be
arguing
that
this
was
a
traditional
reasonable
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
probably
so
without
having
obviously
gone
in
the
same
depth
into
the
record
in
chimel
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
case
--
the
searches
are
quite
similar
both
in
scope
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
we
would
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
we
have
frankly
not
interpreted
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
in
that
light.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
for
the
sake
of
arguments
hereafter
in
this
case,
i
think,
i'm
assuming
that
chimel
is
the
law.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
certainly
so
and
if
we
had
the
same
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
they’re
unquestionably
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
the
problem
is
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
much
like
the
chimel
case
two
years
ago.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
though
we
do
not
argue
that
there
is
such
a
difference
between
the
facts
of
chimel
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
we’ve
simply
not
taking
that
position
in
the
present
case
that
it
is
different
from
chimel
in
a
material
way.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand
mr.
justice
black
and
this
is
a
basic
principle
to
the
approach
that
the
court
has
taken,
the
majority
of
the
court
has
taken
retroactivity
cases
and
the
approach
that
we’re
here
arguing,
that
there
are
sub-principles
of
reasonableness
which
have
emerged
over
the
years
at
various
times
with
reasonable
clarity.
for
example,
we
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
not
absolute
rigid
principle
mr.
justice
black,
but
principles
nonetheless
on
which
the
police
officers
for
example
have
based
their
behavior.
for
example
the
rabinowitz
rule
that
--
if
there
is
an
arrest,
you
may
search
within
certain
limits
--
the
place
of
the
arrest.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
certainly
as
an
ultimate
principle
that
is
so,
but
it
is
certainly
is
true
that
the
precedences
are
of
some
value.
i
think
both
to
the
courts
and
particularly
to
police
officers
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
certainly
think
that
is
true,
though
of
course
there
are
substantially
some
cases
where
the
circumstances
are
substantially
the
same
as
in
others.
and
of
course
that’s
a
judging
problem
in
determining
which
circumstances
are
enough
like
others
to
lead
to
the
same
result.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice
white.
again,
because
as
i
indicated
this
search
was
very
much
like
the
chimel
search
which
the
court
in
chimel
itself
indicated
would
have
been
alright
under
the
prior
law.
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
as
mr.
florence
suggested
in
issue
as
to
the
ownership
of
this
house.
the
police
have
been
observing
williams
for
sometime
and
had
seen
him,
both
of
the
police
and
the
federal
narcotic
agents,
and
had
seen
him
come
and
go
repeatedly
from
this
house
that
hours
which
would
indicate
that
he
was
living
there
and
i
think
they
didn’t
need
to
search
the
title.
it
was
enough
to
know
that
this
was
his
apparent
residence
and
perhaps
even
that
would
be
necessary.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
--
mr.
justice
white,
we
do
not
have
to
make
that
argument
in
this
case.
of
course,
that
was
the
decision
in
the
harris
case
which
rabinowitz
had
said,
was
at
least
revived
or
continued
to
be
good
law
after
rabinowitz
and
i
think
clearly
until
the
chimel
decision
two
terms
that
go,
this
case
--
this
search
however,
was
a
considerably
more
focused
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
was
a
search
which
was
aimed
at
looking,
again
as
in
the
last
case,
from
what
currency
which
had
been
used
and
the
sale
on
which
the
arrest
was
based
and
was
in
fact
found
and
then
a
search
for
narcotics
which
also
were
found.
so,
it
was
not
a
general
exploratory
search
or
the
kind
of
mass
seizure
for
example
that
the
court
found
in
von
cleef
case
decided
at
the
same
time
as
chimel.
and
as
to
the
argument
that
the
officers
had
a
bad
motive
because
they
had
allegedly
discussed
searching
at
the
meeting,
i
think
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
was
a
factual
question
which
was
resolved
by
both
courts
below.
the
only
evidence
of
discussion
of
search
and
the
evidence
doesn’t
go
beyond
that.
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
that
the
officers
planned
the
arrest
as
a
pretext
for
a
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
the
real
explanation
and
i’m
speculating
of
course
is
that
there
were
three
jurisdictions
involved
here.
there
were
the
federal
narcotic
agents,
there
were
state
liquor
and
narcotic
agents,
and
the
local
police.
i
think
some
of
them
may
have
been
the
in
the
ease
of
cooperation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
each
of
those
jurisdiction
had
an
interest
in
this
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
that’s
i
believe
i
don’t
have
--
there
were
more
than
one
of
each
in
any
event.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
why
it
was
necessary
to
have
so
many
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
is
not.
there
are
some
suggestions
in
the
record
that
some
of
the
officers
had
more
passive
and
others
had
more
active
roles.
some
of
them
may
well
simply
have
been
standing
around
watching.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly
not
mr.
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
mr.
justice
marshall.
though
i
think
the
evidence
suggested
that
mr.
williams
was
a
substantial
narcotics
dealer.
given
the
right
and
obligation
in
fact
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
provide
against
contingencies.
they
might
well
when
they
went
to
his
house
to
come
up
against
the
substantial
number
of
people.
i
think
they
didn’t
know
what
to
expect
so
that
maybe
a
justification
what
may
seem
like
excessive
man
power
in
retrospect.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
actually
on
the
evening
of
the
arrest,
they
had
gotten
the
warrant
late
in
afternoon.
they
were
looking
for
him
all
evening,
they
traveled
around,
they
didn’t
know
where
he
was.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
though
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
admit
that
i
have
no
compelling
answer
for
that,
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
he
wasn’t
there
when
they
arrived
there.
he
arrived
while
they
were
watching
the
house.
he
might
well
have
arrived
with
a
car
full
of
confederates
for
all
that
the
agents
could
foresee.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
that
the
facts
suggest,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
i
don’t
have
the
exact
lay
out
of
the
house.
i
think
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record
he
drove
up
the
drive
way
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
the
distance
perhaps
from
you
to
me
between
the
car
and
the
house.
and
i
think,
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
the
officers
wait
until
he
got
into
the
house
and
i
think
that
probably
could’ve
done
anything
else
after
they
want
took
a
few
seconds
to
evaluate
what
had
happen
and
decide
whether
this
was
the
man
they
wanted
or
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
certainly
think
it
would
not
be
under
reasonableness
mr.
justice
black.
so,
that
this
case
does
boil
down
to
a,
i
think
a
simple
question
whether
the
chimel
should
be
retroactive
as
to
cases
that
were
on
direct
appeal
as
this
case
was
when
chimel
was
decided.
of
course,
we
think
our
situation
is
governed
by
the
court’s
express
decision
in
the
desist
case
which
was
also
a
direct
appeal
case
and
therefore,
we
think
that
a
decision
to
reverse
in
this
case
would
have
to
depend
upon
an
overruling
of
desist
which
like
this
case
was
a
fourth
amendment
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
we
do
not
as
the
court
did
not
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
desist
we
stand
on
desist
as
been
unreasonable
and
we
think
that
desist
as
desist
said
in
the
majority
opinion
reflects
appropriately
the
purpose
of
a
new
fourth
amendment
rule
such
as
the
katz
rule
or
the
chimel
rule
in
this
case
which
of
course
is
as
the
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
to
prevent
and
not
to
repair
to
court
for
service
in
the
elkanich
decision.
the
purpose
of
a
fourth
amendment
principle
is
to
deter
illegal
police
behavior,
so
that
we
think
that
in
determining
what
impact
a
rule
should
have
in
a
particular
case.
the
focus
should
be
upon
the
police
behavior
in
question.
if
in
a
rule
were
to
have
to
a
fact
on
searches
that
had
taken
place
while
the
old
rule
was
in
effect,
the
justification
and
any
kind
of
practical
terms
we
think
would
have
to
be
that
the
court
intended
to
penalize
law
enforcement
officials
for
activity
which
they
had
no
reason
to
think
was
in
the
least
bit
illegal
or
unreasonable
at
the
time
they
carried
it
out.
and
given
the
need
as
i
have
suggested
of
law
enforcement
officials
to
have
workable
rules,
almost
rules
of
thumb
that
thousands
of
policemen
and
other
officials
throughout
the
country
can
apply,
we
think
that
their
reliance
upon
such
rule
should
not
be
retroactively
punished.
in
terms
of
the
effects
on
cases,
i
think
it’s
instructive
to
consider
both
the
circumstances
of
both
to
this
case
and
of
elkanich.
if
this
search
--
the
searches
in
these
two
cases
are
held
to
have
been
unreasonable
and
their
fruits
are
excluded
from
evidence,
there
is
no
way
that
these
cases
can
be
reconstructed.
if
evidence
was
illegally
seized
there’s
no
way
that
the
police
can
--
what
i
can
think
of
that
the
police
can
after
the
fact
now
or
anytime
get
a
warrant
and
go
back
and
see
the
same
evidence
and
these
both
happened
to
be
cases
like
i
think
a
good
many
others
where
without
this
evidence
it
would
been
--
could’ve
been
very
hard
for
the
government
to
prove
its
case.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
case
where
there
is
other
proof,
there
is
the
traditional
kind
of
burden
upon
the
administration
of
justice
which
the
court
has
considered
to
be
pertinent
and
it's
other
retroactivity
cases.
the
problem
of
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it’s
awfully
hard
to
--
when
you
know
--
perhaps
in
the
situation
whether
it’s
clearly
probable
cause.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
this
case,
we
haven’t
contended
that
there
was
probable
cause.
if
there
was
probable
there
is
all
out
much
more
probable
cause
for
having
found
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
could
be
argued,
but
weren’t
--
we
haven’t
bitten
off
that
particular
point
here.
here,
the
problem
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
connecting
williams
as
narcotics
dealings
in
anyway
with
his
home.
now,
of
course
it
is
reasonable
in
narcotics
cases
and
heroine
cases
to
think
that
a
trafficker
may
well
be
keeping
narcotics
in
his
home.
i
don’t
think
we
would
abandon
the
argument
in
any
future
case
that
that
by
itself
the
fact
that
a
known
narcotics
trafficker
was
living
in
that
house
that
might
not
in
itself
be
a
basis
or
probable
cause.
we're
not
however
arguing
it
in
this
case
where
the
case
has
not
come
up
in
those
terms
through
lower
courts
i
think.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
they
had
known
that
he
was
--
well,
sale
on
which
the
arrest
warrant
was
based
was
the
9th
of
march
which
was
about
three
weeks
before
the
arrest
and
the
search.
i
think
there
is
evidence
that
at
least
the
local
police
had
been
observing
williams'
comings
and
goings
from
that
place
for
a
matter
of
months
before
that.
though,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
any
connection
between
that
house
and
the
narcotics
dealings
though
they
were
familiar
with
the
fact
that
he
lived
there.
we
suggest,
therefore,
that
the
court
should
stand
by
its
conclusion
that
the
rational
cut
off
point
in
any
search
and
seizure
case
at
least
for
retroactivity
purposes
is
the
date
of
the
police
activity
which
the
new
rule
determines
to
be
illegal.
i
think
upon
analysis
this
turns
out
to
be
the
most
rational
fairest
cut
off
point
that
could
be
evolved.
to
be
sure,
it’s
been
suggested
that
turning
down
a
man
whose
case
was
on
direct
review
at
the
time
the
new
rule
was
laid
down,
is
in
a
sense
unfair
to
him
because
one
man
who
comes
to
this
court,
one
day
he
gets
relief
and
a
man
who
comes
to
the
court
in
the
same
posture
the
next
day
does
not.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don’t
think
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
man
who
came
the
day
before
for
chimel
did
for
example,
should
be
given
relief
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
this
court
at
about
the
same
time
as
chimel,
and
of
course
he
is
penalized
perhaps
because
his
lawyer
or
if
he
had
one
didn’t
draft
his
petition
perhaps
as
artistically
has
chimel
did
or
for
some
reason
or
other
the
court
happen
to
take
a
wider
case
rather
than
an
earlier
one.
also,
i
think
it
has
to
be
now
recognized
that
how
long
a
particular
case
remains
pending
on
direct
review
is
the
product
of
a
number
of
factors
which
don’t
necessarily
reflect
upon
fairness.
a
more
affluent
defendant
or
a
defendant
with
a
less
responsible
lawyer
may
have
more
or
less
a
better
or
worse
lawyer
depending
on
the
circumstances
may
have
for
one
reason
or
another
kept
this
case
alive
on
direct
review
with
arguments
that
have
nothing
to
do
perhaps
with
the
new
rule
to
which
he
becomes
the
beneficiary
just
because
perhaps
his
case
had
been
kept
alive
on
the
basis
of
arguments
that
might
been
criminally
frivolous.
and
of
course,
the
states
of
--
the
dockets
of
the
various
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
around
the
country,
again,
are
--
these
factors
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
fairness
of
whether
one
defendant
should
be
in
jail
or
another
one
should
be
out.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
it
did
to
the
court
in
desist
that
the
fairest
most
rational
dividing
point
is
the
date
of
the
activity
upon
which
the
new
rule
focuses
and
if
the
new
rule
focuses
upon
pre-trial
investigatory
activity
as
many
of
the
new
rules
the
court
has
considered
to
the
cut
off
date
should
be,
the
date
of
the
activity
and
that
was
carried
out
in
reliance
on
the
old
rule.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that
does
mr.
justice
blackmun.
of
course
that
i
believe,
i
think
that
the
--
and
some
justices
at
least
if
not
the
court
have
suggested
that
any
new
rule
could
be
made
wholly
perspective.
there’s
at
least
no
constitutional
barrier
to
doing
that,
though
as
the
opinion
in
stovall
against
denno
which
considered
this,
suggested
there
maybe
i
think
or
a
jurisprudential
reasons
for
not
doing
that
and
that’s
the
problem
of
simple
incentive
of
lawyers
to
bring
cases
raising
new
principles
to
the
further
consideration,
that
the
court
has
over
the
years
considered
that
its
decision
are
best
made
when
they
are
required
and
made
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
a
particular
record.
i
think
it
is
a
little
harsh
and
rigid
to
say
that
because
the
court
has
chosen
not
to
make
new
law
in
that
wholly
perspective
way
that
it
must
therefore
give
relief
to
everybody
whose
case
was
on
direct
review
either
in
this
court
or
some
other
court
at
the
time
of
the
new
decision.
because
and
as
i’ve
suggested
that
in
terms
of
the
practicalities
and
in
terms
of
the
hundreds
or
thousands
defendants
who
are
in
prison
around
the
country,
that
is
not
a
very
fair
or
i
would
submit
rational
dividing
line.
i
might
just
say
a
word
about
the
point
that
both
mr.
florence
and
the
petitioner
in
elkanich
raised
as
to
what
the
government
says,
the
principle
is
upon
which
the
court
should
determine
whether
there
is
a
retroactivity
question
or
not.
i
think
it’s
not
a
fair
reading
of
our
argument
to
say
that
we
have
concoctive
the
magical
term
landmark
and
that
it’s
only
landmark
cases
which
are
not
--
we
argue
would
not
be
a
retroactive.
i
think
that
the
question
whether
there
is
a
retroactivity
question
which
may
in
some
cases
be
a
hard
one,
though,
i
don’t
think
it
is
here
has
to
be
made
in
terms
of
the
practical
question
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
change
in
the
rules
by
which
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
for
example,
police
behavior
has
been
molded
and
could
reasonably
be
molded
or
in
the
case
of
matters
occurring
at
trial
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
change
in
a
rule
that
has
been
used
for
the
guidance
of
trial
courts.
i
think
in
each
case
as
all
of
these
retroactivity
considerations
that
must
considered
in
terms
of
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
without
anticipating
here
the
argument
in
the
next
case
which
i
also
be
doing
for
the
government,
the
williams
case.
it
may
be
helpful
to
take
a
minute
at
the
outset
to
outline
the
issues
that
are
in
this
pair
related
cases
in
the
government’s
position
and
presentation
in
each
of
them.
the
present
case
the
elkanich
case
can
we
think
the
affirmed
on
either
of
two
browns
and
i
think
mr.
miller
has
acknowledged
that
at
least
to
the
formal
letter.
first
of
the
search
which
happen
long
before
chimel
was
valid
under
pre-chimel
standards
and
chimel
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
here
on
plenary
review.
and
second,
that
even
a
part
from
that
even
assuming
that
chimel
did
apply.
the
search
in
this
case
would
be
consistent
with
the
principles
of
chimel
in
view
of
the
conglomeration
of
special
circumstances
that
i
will
discuss
in
a
couple
of
minutes.
in
the
next
case,
the
williams
case,
we
similarly
argue
that
the
search
was
valid
under
the
pre-chimel
standards
enforced
when
the
cert
was
made.
the
williams
contest
that
proposition
as
i
think
its
fair
to
say,
elkanich
does
not
but
we
do
not
argue
that
the
william
search
would
be
valid
that
if
it
had
taken
place
after
chimel.
accordingly,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
williams
judgment
on
the
sole
ground
of
nonretroactivity
of
chimel.
now
on
this
retroactivity
issue
that’s
common
to
the
two
cases.
they
differ
in
that
as
i’ve
indicated
chimel
--
elkanich
comes
here
on
collateral
review
whereas
williams
is
here
on
direct
review
of
the
conviction
and
was
in
fact
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
chimel
was
decided.
for
reasons
that
i
would
go
into
my
argument
in
the
next
case,
we
think
that
makes
no
difference
since
the
crucial
dividing
point
for
retroactivity
purposes
should
be
the
date
of
the
search
as
the
court
held
in
desist.
my
argument
on
retroactivity
in
the
present
case
will
be
a
simpler
one
presents
in
order
to
prevail
on
that
issue.
i
think
elkanich
would
have
to
convince
the
court
that
chimel
should
be
fully
retroactive
without
regard
to
the
more
delicate
questions
of
dividing.
but
before
i
go
into
the
retroactivity
question
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
our
proposition
that
the
search
of
elkanich’s
apartment
was
under
all
the
circumstances,
one
that
would
be
valid
even
if
it
were
carried
on
today.
this
is
a
very
important
proposition
for
the
government
and
we
asserted
here
just
as
strenuously
as
we
do
the
nonretroactivity
point
even
though
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
reach
it
depending
on
how
the
court
decides
the
case.
on
the
search
question,
we
start
with
the
premise
which
is
not
contested
that
this
was
a
search
made
pursuant
to
a
valid
arrest
without
a
warrant.
in
fact,
the
validity
of
the
arrest
was
the
question
that
was
litigated
on
direct
review
in
1963,
1964.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
ample
probable
cause
to
arrest
elkanich
in
his
apartment.
this
court
denies
certiorari
and
as
i
indicated,
i
think
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
validity
of
arrest
here
on
collateral
review.
we
acknowledge
however,
that
the
search
of
the
apartment
of
elkanich’s
apartment
was
more
extensive
than
what
chimel
indicated,
would
routinely
be
appropriate
as
an
instant
to
an
arrest
without
a
search
warrant
in
the
future.
it
is
not
simply
a
search
without
commit
himself
and
the
area
within
his
immediate
control
where
he
could
obtain
weapons
or
destructible
evidence.
we
acknowledge
this
was
a
search
by
several
narcotics
agent
and
at
least
two
of
the
three
rooms
of
elkanich’s
small
apartment
and
then
it
went
on
for
some
time
as
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
it’s
that’s
a
little
unclear.
the
agents
were
there
roughly
an
hour.
the
record
suggests
that
they
spent
a
good
deal
at
time,
trying
to
persuade
the
elkanich
to
cooperate
with
them
and
reveal
his
sources.
so,
it’s
hard
to
re-establish
exactly
how
many
agents
spent
how
long
searching
through
things.
we
do
admit
though
that
it
was
a
search
of
some
scope
and
time.
the
products
of
the
search
which
were
introduced
in
evidence
were
merely
two
things.
marked
currency
which
was
found
in
the
kitchen
closet
and
a
plastic
bag
which
was
found
in
the
living
room
closet;
and
which
was
similar
to
the
plastic
bag
that
have
been
used
in
some
of
the
sales
of
narcotics,
sales
of
heroin
that
were
involved
in
the
trial.
but
as
i
indicate,
we
believe
that
the
combination
of
special
circumstances
here
did
make
the
search
reasonable
without
--
and
that
the
search
therefore
should
not
be
judge
solely
by
the
standards
established
in
chimel
as
to
routine
searches
pursuant
to
arrest.
this
was
not
routine
search.
we
think
that
there
were
really
three
exceptional
factors
here.
first,
we
think
the
record
shows
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
relatively
narrowly
focus
search
in
terms
of
what
the
agents
apparently
were
looking
for
and
what
they
found
would
actually
occurred
here.
second,
there
was
a
real
danger.
we
think
the
record
shows
that
agents
did
not
search
the
apartment
when
they
did
when
they
went
there
to
arrest
elkanich.
the
evidence
they
reasonably
expected
to
find
in
the
apartment
would
be
removed
or
destroyed.
and
third
and
i
think
most
important
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
some
of
the
others
that
have
been
mentioned.
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
the
arrest
had
brought
the
agents
to
the
apartment
with
such
genuine
urgency
that
it
was
not
reasonably
practicable
for
them
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
even
though
we
think
they
could
have
if
they
had
have
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though,
i
think
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though,
i
think
on
examination
of
the
opinion
in
vale.
the
court
went
to
the
majority
went
to
some
pains
to
point
out
that
that
was
not
a
case
where
it
was
impracticable
to
get
a
search
warrant.
so,
on
this
third
point
which
i
emphasized
because
i
think
it
is
a
more
unique
point.
i
think
vale
does
not
by
any
means
foreclose
that.
that
the
vale
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
time.
i
think
there
was
an
arrest
warrant
there,
that
there
was
time
to
get
a
search
warrant.
now,
there
may
have
been
some
--
some
factual
disputes
as
i
guess
vale
was
characterized
by
a
good
deal
of
factual
dispute.
but
at
least
those
with
the
terms
in
which
the
majority
decided
that
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
will
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
will
get
to
the
facts
which
i
think.
i
hope
to
do
before
the
lunch
break.
of
course
as
i
indicate,
we
are
not
rearguing
chimel
here
even
though,
that
the
dissenters
in
that
case
believe
that
the
first
two
of
the
factors
probable
cause
and
danger
of
loss
of
evidence
were
present
there.
again,
i
think
this
case
is
different
from
that
because
of
this
third
factor
and
in
fact
the
chimel
rule
that
the
statement
of
the
rule
in
the
majority
opinion
does
not
really
focus
on
the
two
factors
of
probable
cause
and
danger
of
loss
of
evidence
that
the
dissenters
pointed
out.
so,
i
think
chimel
has
to
be
read
as
stating
the
rule
for
a
routine
search
pursuant
to
an
arrest.
this
brings
me
then
to
the
circumstances
that
we
think
made
it
impracticable
to
obtain
a
warrant
and
this
will
require
me
to
state
the
facts
of
the
case
and
considerable
more
detail
than
the
petitioner
did.
this
case
involved
three
sales
of
heroin
by
a
man
named
rios
to
an
undercover
agent
totaling
about
60
grams
and
these
three
sales
were
over
the
period
of
a
week
in
the
summer
of
1962.
one,
the
first
sale
was
july
13th
and
then
there
were
two
more
on
july
18th
and
19th.
each
time
the
intermediary
rios
was
given
marked
currency
by
the
undercover
agent.
he
went
away
and
came
back
with
the
heroin
which
suggested
of
course
that
he
was
obtaining
it
from
then
unknown
third
party.
rios
was
arrested
on
the
afternoon
very
shortly
after
the
last
of
these
sales
on
july
19th.
on
his
person,
he
had
two
keys
and
an
address
book.
when
questioned
that
afternoon
about
his
source
of
supply,
he
would
say
only
that
it
was
a
chinese
seaman
name
charlie.
it
was
no
--
unable
to
get
anymore
information
than
this
from
rios,
the
undercover
agent
mr.
lang,
testified
that
he
spent
the
evening
of
july
19th
testing
the
keys
he
had
found
in
an
apartment
house
where
apparently
he
had
some
reason
to
suspect
the
keys
might
belong
that
was
unsuccessful.
the
case
began
to
break
on
the
afternoon
of
july
20th,
the
next
day,
when
rios
became
a
bit
more
talkative
maintaining
his
story
about
the
chinese
seaman
named
charlie.
but
admitting
with
the
keys
where
to
room
30
of
a
place
called
the
marlow
hotel.
this
in
fact
was
a
place
where
lang
had
seen
rios
go
from
across
the
street
apparently
to
obtain
the
heroin
that
he
bought
from
him
at
the
first
sale
on
july
13th.
so,
that
marlow
hotel
rang
a
bell
in
lang’s
mind
base
on
his
own
observation
of
that
sale.
almost
immediately
lang
still
the
same
afternoon.
in
fact,
all
of
the
events
of
this
case
through
the
search
take
place
over
a
period
of,
perhaps,
three
or
four
hours
between
sometime
in
the
afternoon
which
had
been
flared
from
the
record
and
about
6
p.m.
when
the
search
took
place.
lang
as
i
say
went
promptly
to
the
hotel
to
check
what
rios
had
told
them
about
the
keys.
he
found
out
from
the
manager
of
the
hotel
that
on
july
13th
which
was
the
night
when
presumably
room
30
had
been
used
in
connection
with
this
sale.
room
30
had
been
rented
not
to
any
chinese
but
to
a
person
who’d
signed
his
name
as
joseph
elkanich,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
manager
describer
him
considerable
detail
and
said
that
the
she’d
been
little
suspicious
because
the
evidence
that
had
indicated
the
next
morning
when
he
hadn’t
slept
in
the
room.
lang
then
went
right
back
to
the
narcotics
headquarters
which
i
presume
i
gather
all
of
these
locations
are
in
fairly
close
proximity
to
each
other
since
the
rent
seem
to
move
quite
quickly.
there
he
looked
up
the
files
on
elkanich
found
that
he
had
been
involved
in
smuggling
of
heroin
from
orient
in
the
past.
he
had
some
other
matters
to
attend
to
in
court
that
afternoon
but
as
soon
as
he
could,
he
obtained
pictures
of
elkanich
from
the
san
francisco
police.
we
discover
he’d
had
him
had
arrested
him
and
it
served
some
time
on
a
local
robbery
i
believe
conviction.
but
he
take
pictures
from
them
then
he
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
verified
with
the
hotel
clerk
that
these
pictures
look
like
the
man
who
had
rented
room
30
on
july
13th,
the
night
of
the
first
sale.
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
at
this
point
and
probably
at
this
point
for
the
first
time
probable
cause
to
go
after
elkanich
had
emerged.
elkanich
was
tied
quite
clearly
to
the
place
where
apparently
the
narcotics
had
been
obtained
from
and
it
was,
perhaps
at
least
reasonable
to
suspect
that
elkanich
had
also
been
the
source
for
the
two
other
sales
within
the
very
short
period
of
a
few
days
that
rios
had
made
to
the
agent.
having
suddenly
discovered
that
elkanich
seem
to
be
the
man.
it
was
a
matter
of
considerable
urgency
to
the
police
to
the
narcotics
agents
to
go
after
him.
rios
had
obviously
made
efforts
to
conceal
his
source
of
supply
and
he
had
the
police
discovered
then
had
access
as
mr.
miller
mention
to
a
telephone
at
the
county
jail
where
he
was
being
held.
i
don’t
suppose
that
the
urgency
depends
on
what
he
might
have
done
after
that
point.
he
might
already
--
he
might
well
already
have
tipped
elkanich
off
and
elkanich
might
be
packing
to
leave
town
or
whatever.
so,
it
seemed
to
them
that
it
was
quite
urgent
to
pursue
elkanich
as
properly
as
they
could.
and
in
addition,
assuming
that
there
had
been
substantial
dealings
between
elkanich
and
rios,
elkanich
might
without
regard
any
telephone
call
had
suddenly
discovered
that
his
intermediary
was
missing.
so,
that
in
any
event
the
police,
the
agent
felt
and
i
think
in
good
faith
and
was
substantial
justification
that
they
should
find
this
man
as
soon
as
they
could.
in
fact,
they
proceeded
very
promptly
to
do
so.
they
check
with
the
telephone
company
by
subpoena
and
discovered
that
he
had
an
armless
to
telephone
having
listed
an
apartment
at
the
address,
in
fact,
the
apartment
where
he
was
where
they
went
to
find
him
and
arrested
him
and
searched.
in
addition,
they
found

mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
lunch
hour,
we
left
off
at
the
verge
of
the
trip
by
the
agents
to
elkanich's
apartment
where
they
arrested
and
searched.
at
that
point,
it
was
about
5:45
on
the
same
afternoon
that
leads
to
that
--
led
to
the
focus
on
elkanich
first
came
to
the
agents’
attention.
and
as
i
indicated
that
the
agents
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
they
should
pursue
elkanich
with
this
much
urgency
as
they
could.
at
this
time
at
5:45
in
the
afternoon,
agent
lang
who
was
handling
the
matter
principally
did
try
to
reach
the
united
states
commissioner;
he
was
unable
to
do
so.
in
any
event,
i
think
under
the
circumstances
as
that
it
might
have
been
imprudent
even
if
the
commissioner
was
right
on
hand
perhaps
to
take
the
time
for
the
mechanical
and
secretarial
work
of
preparing
papers
looking
toward
a
search
warrant.
but
in
any
event,
they
were
unable
to
find
the
commissioner
and
accordingly,
lang
and
two
other
agents
preceded
immediately
to
elkanich's
apartment
where
they
arrested
him
and
made
the
search.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well
that
really
leaves
me
into
another
factor.
i
think
under
these
circumstances,
it’s
fair
to
say
there
was
nothing
reasonable
they
could
do
to
freeze
the
status
in
the
apartment
pending
efforts
to
get
a
search
warrant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
for
example
there's
that
we
conceive
really
in
the
next
case,
in
the
williams
case,
there's
a
good
deal
of
difference.
there,
there
was
an
arrest
warrant.
the
arrest
was
made
on
the
basis
of
a
sale
of
narcotics
that
were
some
three
weeks
before
the
arrest.
i
think
that
kind
of
case
is
probably
also
quite
typical
of
narcotics
cases
where
sale
is
made
but
the
agents
hold
off
making
an
arrest
before
a
certain
period
of
time
which
of
course
can’t
go
too
far
while
they
try
to
find
sources
of
supply
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
the
difference
in
this
case
as
i
tried
to
show
in
the
facts
i
stated
is
that
the
case
broke
very
quickly
under
circumstances
where
there
were
good
grounds
to
believe
that
they
wouldn’t
be
able
to
find
the
man
they
were
looking
for
unless
they
went
for
him
promptly
and
then
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
they
didn’t
know
they
were
looking
for
and
until
i
don’t
how?
until
a
relatively
few
minutes
before
they
could
get
the
information
from
a
telephone
company
and
then
go
on
to
his
apartment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
they
didn’t
know
the
identity
of
the
man
they
were
looking
for
until
that
same
afternoon.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
so
though
there
is
an
additional
fact
when
we
get
into
it
but
danger
of
lost
of
evidence.
if
he
were
an
interstate
theft
of
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
television
sets
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
i’m
sure
of
course
there
are
additional
factors.
this
is
exigency,
the
impracticability
of
getting
a
search
warrant.
there's
also
the
fact
that
we
submit
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
look
for
the
specific
items
they
were
looking
for
and
there
were
circumstances
where
there
was
a
serious
danger
that
the
evidence
would
disappear;
and
it
was
impracticable
for
them,
unreasonable
in
fact
for
them
to
seal
off
the
area
where
the
evidence
might
be
until
they
can
a
search
warrant.
this
was
because
the
apartment
had
another
occupant
who
has
been
described
as
elkanich’s
common
law
wife
but
apparent
she
in
any
event
she
lived
there.
she
had
certain
rights
in
the
premises
since
it
was
narcotics
heroin
that
was
in
question
which
of
course
a
very
small
item,
the
only
way
that
the
agents
could
have
guarded
against
the
risk
that
the
evidence
would
disappear
or
be
flushed
down
the
toilet
or
something
like
that.
it
would
have
been
to
supervise
and
watch
this
ms.
egan’s
activities
very
closely.
i
think
under
circumstances
where
she
would
impractical
terms
had
been
virtually
under
arrest
until
they
could
get
a
search
warrant.
of
course
they
had
no
basis
for
restricting
her
freedom
in
that
way
or
they
could
have
excluded
her
from
the
apartment.
but
again
that
was
a
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
don’t
think
the
record
shows
anything.
i
mean
to
say
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not
as
far
as
the
record
shows.
it’s
a
--
i'm
not
sure
where
the
information
comes
from
that
she
will
a
common-law
wife.
but
anyway,
she
was
apparently
living
there.
she
was
present
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
she
was
present
in
the
apartment.
in
fact,
she
opened
the
door
to
let
the
agents
in.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
i
certainly
think
so
mr.
justice
black
and
it
was
i
think
entirely
proper
for
the
agents
to
have
considerable
concern
for
her
freedom
and
her
rights
to
go
on
living
in
her
apartment.
so,
then
to
the
circumstances,
i
think
the
search
considering
the
rights
of
both
of
parties
was
considerable
less
of
intrusion
than
an
attempt
to
freeze
the
situation
pending
efforts
to
get
a
warrant.
i
might
also
just
review
the
circumstances
that
we
think
made
for
the
additional
factor
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search.
in
other
words,
they
could
have
been
a
warrant
had
there
been
time.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
black
and
at
first
as
i
indicated
there
had
been
a
reasonable
identification
of
elkanich
as
the
source
of
the
narcotics
that
the
agent
had
bought
from
the
intermediary
rios.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that’s
certainly
so
mr.
justice
black.
though
there
are
of
course
over
the
years
they
have
developed
different
focuses
aspects
of
the
reasonableness
aspect.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
we
would
submit
of
course
that
under
special
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here.
it
should
be
open
despite
chimel
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that’s
exactly
one
mr.
justice
black
and
we
think
that
the
chimel
cannot
be
read
as
an
absolute
rigid
rule
as
to
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
by
way
of
search
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
according
that
we
say
this
additional
factors
here
highly
as
pungent.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
certainly
does
though
of
court
when
you
talk
about
trailer
truck,
you
may
get
into
the
vehicle
search
kind
of
situation
which
is
perhaps
a
different
category.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
well
without
as
i
indicate
the
very
serious
intrusions
upon
the
other
occupant
of
the
apartment.
i
think
of
a
further
factor
in
addition
to
the
three,
the
exigency,
the
probable
cause
and
the
danger
of
losing
the
evidence.
i
think
it
is
pertinent
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
a
search
at
the
time
of
arrest.
the
fact
that
there
is
an
arrest,
does
mean
that
the
defendant
will
quite
shortly
be
brought
before
magistrate
and
quite
shortly
have
a
lawyer
appointed
to
protect
him.
so,
its
--
i
think
the
context
in
which
this
occurs
is
somewhat
different
from
the
context,
where
their
might
not
be
with
few
minute
safeguards
that
arise
out
of
the
arrest
situation.
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
some
analogy
though
i
don’t
want
to
press
it
too
far
between
the
decision
last
term
in
chambers
against
maroney,
where
in
connection
with
the
vehicle
search,
the
two
factors
of
probable
cause
and
the
danger
of
loss
to
the
evidence
were
regarded
as
enough
without
either
an
arrest
or
perhaps
at
least
so
clearly
the
notion
of
impracticability
of
getting
a
warrant.
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
retroactivity
questions
that
have
been
raised
by
the
petitioner
here.
as
i
indicated
what
i
said
so
far
has
assumed
what
we
argue
not
to
be
the
case
but
the
chimel
governs
this
case.
i
emphasized
again
that
this
case
elkanich
is
a
collateral
review
case
since
the
search
took
place
in
1962
and
the
conviction
became
final
in
1964
so
that
in
order
to
prevail
the
petitioner
would
have
to
convince
the
court
of
the
chimel
rule
should
be
fully
retroactive.
its
principle
point
of
course
is
that,
i
guess
he
argues
that
we
don’t
have
a
retroactivity
case
here
because
chimel
was
not
the
kind
of
change
in
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
which
invokes
a
retroactivity
problem.
but
i
think
its
simplicity
at
least
in
what
mr.
miller
said
that
he
believes
that
if
we
do
have
a
retroactivity
problem
here
the
principles
of
desist
and
in
fact
all
of
the
court’s
cases
since
linkletter
in
1965
indicate
that
this
case
should
not
be
governed
by
chimel.
i
think,
the
first
place
to
look
in
determining
whether
chimel
is
a
kind
of
change
in
the
law
that
creates
a
retroactivity
problem
is
the
chimel
opinion
itself,
where
the
court
discuss
the
prior
law
at
some
length,
and
said
clearly
that
the
rabinowitz
case
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“has
come
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
warrantless
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
may
generally
extend
the
area
that
is
considered
to
be
in
the
possession
or
under
the
control
of
the
person
arrested.”
and
added
another
point
the
court
says,
the
rationale
that
allowed
the
searches
and
seizures
in
rabinowitz
and
harris
would
allow
the
searches
and
seizures
in
this
case.
chimel
involved
the
search
of
an
entire
three-bedroom
house
by
three
officers
that
went
on
for
a
good
part
of
an
hour.
rabinowitz
involved
a
meticulous
search
of
all
of
the
drawers
and
cabinets
of
an
office
that
went
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
harris
was
a
five-hour
search
of
a
four-room
apartment.
all
of
these
searches
were
i
think
considerably
more
elaborate
than
the
search
in
this
case
and
so,
i
think
the
--
it
was
contemporary
standards
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
search
as
express
explicitly
by
this
court
in
its
decisions
continued
to
be
good
law.
petitioner
suggest
that
any
policeman
worthy
of
the
name,
to
use
this
phrase,
should
have
noticed
some
years
before
chimel
that
this
court
had
lost
enthusiasm
for
the
rabinowitz
rule
and
therefore
should
have
seized
relying
on
it
as
a
guide
for
their
investigatory
work,
i
think
that’s
unrealistic.
in
1962
as
a
matter
of
fact,
though
as
petitioner
suggests
without
enthusiasm,
this
court
relied
on
the
rabinowitz
case
and
the
abel
case.
considering
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
rules
of
primary
behavior
by
police
officers
who
i
think
have
to
be
able
to
carry
on
their
work
with
some
degree
of
certainty
and
simplicity
as
to
rules.
i
think
that
it’s
simply
unrealistic
to
say
that
the
police
were
not
entitled
to
rely
upon
rabinowitz
rule
in
1962
or
for
that
matter
in
1964
when
the
conviction
began
final
here.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
