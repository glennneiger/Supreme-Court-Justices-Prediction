mr.
charles
a.
miller
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
two
with
it
follow:
present
the
question
of
the
extent
of
retroactive
application
of
the
decision
in
chimel
versus
california,
decided
in
the
1968
term.
chimel
dealt
with
the
permissible
scope
of
a
search
without
a
warrant,
but
pursuant
to
a
lawful
arrest.
the
fourth
amendment
has
long
been
understood
to
permit
a
search
without
warrant
as
an
incident
to
a
valid
arrest.
the
question
in
chimel
was
how
far
can
a
search
go
and
still
be
deemed
an
incident
to
a
valid
arrest.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
to
be
incident
to
an
arrest,
a
search
must
be
confined
to
the
person
arrested
or
the
immediate
vicinity
from
which
he
might
reach
weapons
or
destructible
evidence.
any
search
beyond
the
immediate
person
or
the
immediate
vicinity
without
a
validly
issued
search
warrant
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
the
searcher?
i
think
that
there
is
other
doctrine
not
necessary
emanating
from
chimel
that
holds
that
if
the
officer
is
legally
on
the
premises,
he
may
seize
any
contraband
or
other
fruits
of
crime
that
are
visible
to
him.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
a
pistol,
yes.
now
in
chimel,
the
rule
of
that
case
was
applied
to
invalidate
a
search
of
an
entire
house
in
which
the
defendant
was
arrested.
in
the
present
case,
the
convict,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
evidence
seized
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
when
the
rushing
officers
have
no
warrant.
he
was
arrested
in
his
apartment,
and
after
entry
into
the
apartment
and
arrest
of
petitioner,
the
arresting
officers
proceeded
to
search
throughout
the
apartment.
and
in
the
course
of
their
search,
they
uncovered
the
hidden
in
the
closets
and
kitchen
a
certain
evidence
that
was
material
to
petitioner’s
conviction.
now
concededly,
the
search
without
warrant
in
this
case
went
far
beyond
the
petitioner’s
person
or
the
immediate
vicinity
of
his
arrest,
and
the
government
makes
no
claim
now
to
makes
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
defined
in
chimel.
the
government
does
urge
however
that
the
search
here
ought
not
be
deemed
a
violation
of
the
standard
announced
in
chimel
because
there
were
exigent
circumstances
that
justified
a
broader
search
without
warrant,
then
when
otherwise
be
permitted
under
the
chimel
doctrine.
we
treat
this
point
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
--
it
warns
just
a
few
words
this
morning.
the
exigent
circumstances
alleged
here
by
the
government
where
that
the
petitioner’s
wife
was
present
in
the
apartment
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
and
that
she
might
disposed
of
incriminating
evidence
if
a
search
and
seizure
where
not
immediately
undertaken.
this
explanation
for
the
warrantless
search
is
virtually
identical
to
the
justification
for
a
similar
warrantless
search
of
a
dwelling
in
last
year’s
case
of
vale
against
louisiana.
the
argument
was
rejected
in
that
case.
there
the
court
held
that
the
requirement
for
a
warrant
for
a
search
of
a
dwelling
was
subject
only
to
a
few
well
recognized
exceptions,
and
that
the
asserted
justification
advanced
there
which
is
identical
to
the
one
advanced
here
did
not
fall
within
one
of
those
exceptions.
now,
the
government
contends
that
the
present
case
is
different
because
the
officers
here
were
concerned
that
petitioner
might
be
forewarned
of
his
an
imminent
arrest
and
flee,
and
that
this
justified
the
officers
in
making
the
arrest
and
the
search
without
first
securing
the
warrant.
now,
the
basis
of
this
claim
is
that
an
alleged
middleman
in
the
narcotics
dealings
in
which
petitioner
is
accused
was
in
custody
and
the
he
knew,
he
the
middleman,
knew
that
the
officials
were
seeking
his
supplier,
and
that
he
might
therefore
forewarn
his
supplier
by
telephone.
we
think
this
claim
to
be
insufficient
on
the
facts.
the
alleged
middleman
here
had
been
in
custody
for
two
days
prior
to
the
arrest
of
petitioner.
had
he
been
disposed
and
able
to
forewarn
his
supplier,
he
would
have
done
so
for
long
before
petitioner
was
arrested.
moreover,
it
does
not
seem
likely
to
us
that
the
middleman’s
captors
would
have
allowed
him
unrestricted
access
to
a
telephone
for
the
purpose
of
forewarning
accomplices
of
impending
arrest.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well
your
honor,
that’s
the
point
that
was
--
that
is
precisely
the
point
made
in
vale
by
the
arresting
officers
in
that
case.
and
the
court
said
that’s
an
insufficient
ground
for
not
securing
a
warrant
before
making
the
search.
and
that’s
exactly
the
point
we
make
here.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
no,
your
honor,
this
is
here
on
collateral
attack
--
this
is
collateral
review.
this
conviction
became
final
and
cert
was
denied
i
think
in
1967,
1964
excuse
me,
i’ll
correct
it.
in
short,
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
which
i’ll
leave,
the
government
--
we
don’t
believe
has
shown
that
the
arresting
officers
in
this
case
were
justified
in
searching
petitioner’s
apartment
without
first
securing
the
warrant.
we
think
at
beyond
serious
dispute
that
the
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
cannot
pass
master
under
the
standards
for
searches
incident
to
arrest
that
were
announced
in
the
chimel
case.
and
so
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
chimel
should
be
applied
retroactively
in
this
case
which
is
i
said
mr.
justice
harlan
arises
on
collateral
review
of
petitioner’s
conviction.
we
begin
with
the
basic
rule
of
weeks
against
united
states
and
its
progeny
that
a
physical
search
of
the
person
or
his
dwelling
must
be
pursuant
to
a
valid
search
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate
upon
a
showing
of
probable
cause.
now,
there
are
exceptions
to
this
principle.
one
of
which
is
that
a
search
warrant
may
be
conducted
as
--
a
search
may
be
conducted
as
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
this
court
typically
decides
several
cases
each
year
that
explicate
the
basic
week’s
rule
or
its
generally
recognized
exceptions.
no
one
would
reasonably
suggest
that
each
of
these
decisions
and
each
term
of
this
court
be
given
only
prospective
effect,
and
we
know
of
no
such
contention.
indeed,
the
government
here
concedes
that
this
result
of
automatic
prospectivity
might
result
in
an
intolerable
burden
of
sorting
out
the
effective
date
of
each
new
ones
of
the
basic
rules.
even
more
intolerable,
we
submit
would
be
a
regime
whereby
this
court
considered
separately,
and
each
of
these
many
fourth
amendment
cases
whether
to
apply
the
case
retroactively
or
prospectively.
and
yet,
we
recognized
that
the
court
in
recent
years
has
limited
application
of
some
of
its
criminal
procedure
decisions,
including
some
decisions
arising
under
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
provisions,
and
the
question
as
we
see
it
is
therefore
in
what
kind
of
case,
in
what
class
of
case
should
the
court
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
to
apply
a
criminal
procedure
decision
retroactively
or
prospectively?
linkletter
versus
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
it
was
prepared
in
my
office
as
stated
--
i
think,
we
stated
this
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
the
outset
of
the
argument
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
oh
no
sir,
it’s
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
as
we
indicated
here,
the
court
have
not
indicated
prior
to
this
time
a
time
we
follow
our
brief
a
disposition
to
review
the
entire
question
of
retroactivity.
so
we
didn’t
feel
that
an
extended
argument
on
the
point
was
forwarded
but
then
points
raised
in
the
appendix
did
seem
appropriate.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
it’s
also
help
to
sort
out
to
some
of
the
cases
and
the
argument
that
now
with
i
am
going
to
make
this
morning.
i
do
think
that
linkletter
versus
walker
which
is
the
root
case
in
this
area
does
not
answer
the
question
that
is
now
before
this
court
in
this
case
which
is
when
do
you
make
the
determination
of
retroactivity?
linkletter
versus
walker
sets
out
standards
for
deciding
the
question
when
the
question
is
presented
to
the
court.
it
doesn’t
reveal
when
that
question
is
appropriately
raised.
however,
we
think
that
upon
reviewing
some
of
the
retroactivity
decisions
including
those
set
forth
in
the
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
emerges
from
those
cases,
an
appropriate
test
as
to
when
the
question
of
retroactivity
ought
to
be
raised.
there
are
seven
instances
in
which
constitutional
decisions
have
not
been
given
fully
retroactive
effect.
each
of
these
decisions
involved
the
extension
of
a
constitutional
provision
to
a
wholly
new
area
of
activity
where
it
had
not
been
thought
previously
to
apply.
for
example
in
the
katz
case
which
was
given
retroactive,
i
mean
prospective
only
effect
in
desist.
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
extended
for
the
first
time
to
electronic
eavesdropping
or
nontrespassory
invasions
of
property
--
of
privacy.
now
in
miranda
and
escobedo
whose
backward
reach
was
limited
at
johnson
versus
new
jersey
the
right
to
counsel
and
police
interrogations
before
as
well
as
after
indictment
was
established
for
the
first
time,
and
in
the
way
gilbert
case
which
was
given
prospective
only
effect
in
stovall
the
right
to
counsel
and
lineups
was
announced
for
the
first
time.
similarly,
mapp
against
ohio
given
limited
retroactive
effect
in
linkletter
was
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
states
for
the
first
time.
the
jury
cases,
the
bloom
against
illinois
and
duncan
against
louisiana
which
were
given
prospective
only
effect
in
destefano,
those
cases
extended
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
all
state
cases
for
the
first
time.
finally,
the
griffin
case
which
was
given
prospective
only
the
effect
in
tehan
extended
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
provision
to
comments
by
the
judge
for
the
first
time.
all
of
these
cases
involved
in
the
extension
of
a
constitutional
provision
to
a
new
area
of
activity
where
it
have
not
previously
been
thought
to
apply.
however,
the
chimel
decision
which
is
before
us
today
is
of
a
very
different
nature
from
those
cases
that
i’ve
just
canvassed.
chimel
does
not
extend
the
fourth
amendment
to
an
area
of
activity
where
it
had
not
been
thought
previously
to
apply.
from
the
beginning
it
has
been
clear
that
physical
searches
must
meet
fourth
amendment
standards,
even
where
deemed
incident
to
a
valid
arrest
so
that
the
warrant
is
not
mandated,
a
physical
search
is
still
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
chimel
like
many
other
cases
simply
added
refinement
to
the
principle
of
law
that
searches
incident
to
a
valid
arrest
may
be
conducted
without
a
warrant.
chimel
dealt
with
the
dividing
line
between
searches
incident
to
arrest
and
which
need
not
be
accompanied
by
warrant.
and
those
that
meet
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
standard
because
--
i
think
i
said
it
wrong.
chimel
in
affect
dealt
with
the
dividing
line
between
searches
for
which
a
warrant
is
required,
and
those
for
which
a
warrant
is
not
required
but
which
otherwise
meet
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
of
standard.
as
a
result
of
chimel
a
dividing
line
was
moved
somewhat,
and
so
the
incident
to
arrest
doctrine
has
been
constrictive.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well
mr.
justice,
the
rationale
of
chimel
was
that
it
was
a
return
to
pre-rabinowitz
law,
and
i
would
--
without
having
made
a
careful
review
of
the
facts
of
each
case
prior
to
rabinowitz,
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
the
precise
--
whether
the
return
was
precisely
on
all
force
to
where
the
law
was
before
or
this
to
the
general
area
of
where
the
law
was
before.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
it
is
clear
in
the
context
in
which
i’ve
used
this
morning
that
chimel
did
not
represent
an
extension
of
the
constitution
to
a
new
area
of
activity.
even
where
an
arrest
was
incident
to
--
even
where
a
search
was
an
appropriate
incident
to
arrest,
whether
by
rabinowitz
standard
or
by
the
pre-rabinowitz
standard
or
by
the
chimel
standards,
it
was
still
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
still
had
to
meet
the
reasonableness
standard.
no
one
is
ever
suggested
that
a
physical
search
was
wholly
unrelated
to
the
fourth
amendment.
actually,
we
think
that
chimel
does
not
really
differ
at
all
from
other
decisions
of
this
court,
recent
decision
in
which
retroactive
application
has
been
assumed,
and
the
car
search
cases
are
good
example.
they
also
happen
to
deal
with
the
incident
to
arrest
doctrine.
in
the
preston
case
in
376
u.s.,
the
court
ruled
that
a
search
of
a
car
is
police
custody
after
the
driver
had
been
removed
and
placed
in
jail
was
too
remote
to
be
considered
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
and
consequently,
a
warrant
was
required.
but
last
term
in
chambers
against
maroney,
the
court
held
in
almost
identical
factual
circumstances
that
the
car
search
there
was
incident
to
arrest.
now,
i
don’t
believe
it’s
contended
by
anyone
seriously
that
the
chambers
case
should
not
be
given
retroactive
effect
and
that
the
stricter
preston
rule
should
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
i
understand
that
i
am
going
to
point
out
later.
the
court
in
dealing
with
preston
and
the
chambers
case
sought
to
distinguish
preston,
and
i
want
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
a
--
distinguishing
cases
is
one
way
of
limiting
their
application,
as
just
as
overruling
a
past
precedent
in
other
way.
but
another
illustration
of
the
point
i
now
make
is
the
warden
against
hayden
in
387
u.s.,
and
i
think,
this
is
perhaps
even
more
appropriate
example.
here
is
a
case
where
the
prevailing
doctrine
that
seizure
of
mere
evidence
of
crime
was
not
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
rejected.
there
had
been
a
doctrine
that
police
could
search
and
seize
instrumentalities
and
fruits
of
crime,
but
not
“mere
evidence.”
well,
this
court
rejected
that
distinction
in
the
warden
against
hayden
case.
yet
i
know
of
no
suggestion
that
warden
against
hayden
should
be
applied
only
prospectively
with
the
earlier
mere
evidence
rule
left
on
the
books
to
apply
the
cases
that
annotated
warden.
now,
these
examples
and
others
i
think
illustrate
ebb
and
flow
in
the
--
that
is
characteristic
of
decisions
interpreting
the
fourth
amendment,
and
chimel
is
like
those
cases.
it
can’t
be
distinguished
from
them
and
unless
there
are
to
be
limits
on
the
applicability
of
every
fourth
amendment
decision,
an
approach
that
i
think
would
admittedly
wreak
havoc
with
the
administration
of
justice.
there
can
be
no
reason
to
basis
for
limiting
the
application
of
chimel.
it
maybe
suggested
that
chimel
is
different
because
it
expressly
overruled
to
prior
precedent,
the
rabinowitz
and
harris
cases,
and
this
i
think
comes
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
white
was
touching
on.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
would
not
be
a
meaningful
distinction
of
the
chimel
decision
from
the
other
myriad
of
fourth
amendment
decisions
announced
every
year
by
this
court.
many
of
the
court’s
decision
have
the
effect
of
dissipating
earlier
precedents.
sometimes,
it’s
done
by
an
express
overruling.
sometimes
by
distinguishing
a
case
out
of
existence
or
distinguishing
it
in
a
way
that
narrowly
limits
its
ambit.
sometimes
cases
are
discarded
without
mention
at
all,
and
chambers
is
a
good
example
because
there,
the
court
did
not
purport
to
overrule
preston,
but
conceded
--
but
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
chambers
decision
narrows
the
reach
of
preston;
there
can’t
be
too
much
left
to
preston
after
chambers.
indeed,
the
vale
decision
of
last
term
which
i
mentioned
earlier
provides
a
sort
of
different
illustration
to
this
point.
vale
refused
to
permit
a
search
without
warrant
of
a
dwelling
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest
of
the
man
standing
on
the
front
steps
of
the
door.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
yes.
there
was
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
he
was
somewhere
outside
the
front
door
of
his
house.
he
may
have
been
as
far
as
all
the
way
to
the
street.
he
may
have
been
one
step
in
the
front
door.
he
was
on
the
threshold
or
close
to
it.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
indeed.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that’s
right.
now
the
principle
of
that
case
cannot
be
consistent
with
the
underpinnings
of
rabinowitz
in
harris
which
were
that
you
can
--
as
an
incident
to
arrest,
search
any
place
within
the
control
of
the
person
arrested,
certainly
in
that
situation,
his
house
was
within
his
control.
had
chimel
not
intervened
to
overrule
rabinowitz
and
put
it
aside?
it
clearly
would
have
been
said
that
vale
eroded
the
most,
if
not
all
of
the
basis
of
rabinowitz.
yet,
there
is
no
indication
that
vale
is
to
be
applied
prospectively
only.
it’s
simply
another
in
the
continuum
of
cases,
that
add
judicial
interpretation
to
the
meaning
of
the
basic
rule
that
physical
searches
must
be
made
pursuant
to
warrant
except
were
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
yet,
it
would
be
quite
anomalous
to
hold
that
chimel
which
involve
a
search
without
a
warrant
after
arrest
just
inside
the
door
is
not
to
be
given
retroactive
effect,
if
vale
which
involve
a
search
without
warrant
after
arrest
just
outside
the
door
is
to
be
given
retroactive
effect.
the
point
is
that
there
is
nothing
unique
about
the
expressed
overruling
of
a
prior
precedent
that
would
warrant
limiting
the
effect
of
a
particular
new
decision.
and
we
think
the
gideon
case
and
jackson
against
denno
both
of
which
expressly
overruled
prior
precedents
yet
both
of
which
enjoy
full
retroactive
application.
our
further
indicate
that
there
is
no
necessary
requirement
that
a
decision
which
overrules
past
precedent
be
given
only
prospective
effect.
now,
the
government
in
this
brief
has
asserted
a
different
test
for
determining
when
to
consider,
limiting
the
application
of
new
procedural
due
process
rulings
and
the
government’s
test
is
whether
the
new
decision
is
a
landmark
decision.
and
if
it
is
landmark
the
court
then
may
consider
given
it
prospective
only
effect.
that’s
the
government
position
on
page
45.
with
all
respect,
we
submit
that
this
distinction
afford
no
real
standard.
the
term
landmark
is
not
an
objective
standard
and
provides
no
basis
for
distinguishing
cases.
it
cannot
be
said
for
example
that
chambers
which
altered
the
prevailing
law
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
search
of
a
car
incident
to
an
arrest
is
more
or
less
a
landmark
decision
then
chimel
which
altered
the
prevailing
law
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
search
of
a
house
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest.
the
rubric
landmark
does
not
answer
the
question
at
issue
which
is
to
what
class
of
cases
should
the
court
consider
given
prospective
on
the
application.
we
submit
the
only
objective
distinction
that
can
be
drawn
that
has
an
effect
been
drawn
in
the
cases
today
is
between
rulings
extending
the
fourth
amendment
and
other
constitutional
decision
to
new
areas
of
activity
where
they
were
previously
not
applied
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
rulings
that
merely
explicate
the
meaning
of
a
constitutional
provision
without
extending
it
to
a
new
area
of
activity.
the
office
of
the
linkletter
and
desist
line
of
cases
ought
to
be
limited
to
those
constitutional
decisions
where
the
constitution
has
been
extended
to
new
areas
of
activity.
for
this
other
cases,
the
traditional
rule
of
full
retroactive
application
should
be
observed
for
any
other
rule
for
these
cases
would
ultimately
lead
to
chaos
and
destruction
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
i
can
see
that
what
your,
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
your
question
suggests
is
that
what
maybe
reasonable
in
1950
may
on
the
same
effects
be
unreasonable
in
1960?
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
that
maybe
so
but
if
that
where
the
case
then
how
can
one
explain
the
chimel
decision
when
the
officer
was
acting
reasonably
by
the
standard
of
you
just
suggested
because
in
accord
--
acting
in
accordance
with
the
rabinowitz
case
which
was
on
the
books
as
of
the
time
of
the
search
in
chimel.
i
realized
that
you
may
say,
“well,
we
have
to
decide
cases
and
that’s
one
of
the
prices
we
pay
for
deciding
cases.”
but
i
suggest
at
that
that
is
not
a
complete
answer.
i
suggest
it
indeed
that
answer
carries
a
seized
of
a
broader
answer
to
your
question.
there
are
--
chimel
happen
to
be
convenient
and
that
involved
a
past
precedent
which
was
expressly
overruled.
in
the
whole
range
of
fourth
amendment
cases,
there
are
many
cases
that
do
not
present
on
all
force.
facts
that
previously
even
before
this
court
infinite
gradations
of
reasonableness
are
presented
in
every
case
if
--
and
if
an
officer
could
by
some
hindsight
justification
point
to
some
earlier
decision
of
the
courts
from
which
it
could
be
interpreted
that
his
action
was
reasonable.
under
the
suggestion
that
you
just
made
that
would
automatically
result
an
affirmance.
i
think
with
all
respect
to
mr.
justice
that
the
reasonableness
term
is
not
quite
that
elastic
in
the
fourth
amendment
area.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
mr.
justice,
i
haven’t
attempted
in
our
brief
to
go
into
an
extended
discussion
of
that
obviously
point
of
finality
because
it’s
been
canvass
so
thoroughly
by
this
court
in
recent
decisions
in
such
as
kaufman
and
others.
and
there
are
differences
of
opinion
on
them
as
you’re
well
aware.
kaufman
i
think
establishes
the
proposition
that
whatever
else
maybe
said.
notions
of
finality
under
layer
earlier
decisions
to
this
court
are
not
to
be
given
the
same
effect,
the
same
exalted
position
as
they
once
were.
finality
isn’t
important
but
this
cut
across
all
cases
involving
retroactivity
questions
as
against
finality
are
the
--
is
the
interest
in
maintaining
in
prison
or
in
custody,
one
who
has
been
convicted
in
ways
which
we
now
determine
are
contrary
to
the
constitution.
and
i
think
that
question
is
not
unique
to
chimel
but
it
arises
in
every
case
in
which
retroactivity
questions
arise.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i'm
sure
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you.
i
think
indeed
that’s
the
point
i've
tried
to
assert
this
morning.
when
there
is
a
distinction
that
is
marked,
landmark
or
whatever
word
you
want
--
adjective
you
want
to
apply
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
what
i'm
suggesting
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
mere
adjective
like
marked,
landmark
important
or
other
rubric
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
would
say
no
your
honor,
not
i
would
--
if
the
result
is
to
extend
the
constitutional
provision
to
a
new
area
where
it
had
not
previously
been
applied
that
i
would
say,
yes.
but
i
change
that
simply
--
i
change
as
in
chimel
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
marked
changed
but
is
concededly
a
change.
i
would
say
no
because
once
you
agree
that
a
change
in
the
law
is
--
gives
rise
to
prospectivity
or
the
possibility
of
it.
you
inevitably
led
to
the
regime
where
every
case
must
be
reviewed
for
prospective
or
retroactive
application
because
this
court
by
definition
practically
every
case
changes
the
law
to
some
extent.
this
court
doesn’t
sit
on
typical
cases.
it
sits
on
cases
at
the
edge
of
the
law.
it
extends
or
contracts.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i’d
say
that
the
certainly
in
the
fourth
amendment
cases,
i
agree
with
you.
candor
compels
to
agree
with
you.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
all
in
the
case
set
in
two
ways
if
i
may.
first,
i
think
we
--
there
may
be
some
tendency
to
exalt
this
notion
of
official
reliance
on
the
decision
of
this
court
and
especially
it
is
true
in
an
area
like
the
incident
to
arrest
area
which
is
typified
by
decisions
like
rabinowitz
which
say
that
each
case
return
on
its
own
facts.
and
that
the
circumstances
must
govern
in
every
case
and
we
can
make
no
real
hard
and
fast
rules.
we’ve
quoted
the
language
from
rabinowitz
in
our
brief
which
seems
to
me
to
suggests
that
the
--
we
can
carry
at
least
perhaps
to
some
reasonable
extremes
the
notion
that
officers
were
relying
on
supreme
court
decisions
every
time
they
take
an
action
in
this
area.
but
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
notion,
the
question
that
you’ve
just
raised
is
typical
of
the
questions
that
are
asked
when
one
is
applying
the
linkletter
versus
walker
standards.
that’s
one
the
questions
that
is
discussed
in
every
case.
we
suggest
that
linkletter
versus
walker
standards,
a
linkletter
versus
walker
analysis
need
not
and
ought
not
be
made
in
every
criminal
decisions
of
this
court
because
of
the
destructive
effects
that
it
would
have
--
that
would
ensue.
and
so
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
linkletter
versus
walker
type
of
analysis
ought
to
be
limited
to
a
certain
class
of
cases
and
i've
tried
this
morning
to
set
out
the
class
of
cases
which
i
think
it
is
here
before
been
limited
and
which
ought
to
be
limited
in
the
future.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
two
with
it
follow:
present
the
question
of
the
extent
of
retroactive
application
of
the
decision
in
chimel
versus
california,
decided
in
the
1968
term.
chimel
dealt
with
the
permissible
scope
of
a
search
without
a
warrant,
but
pursuant
to
a
lawful
arrest.
the
fourth
amendment
has
long
been
understood
to
permit
a
search
without
warrant
as
an
incident
to
a
valid
arrest.
the
question
in
chimel
was
how
far
can
a
search
go
and
still
be
deemed
an
incident
to
a
valid
arrest.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
to
be
incident
to
an
arrest,
a
search
must
be
confined
to
the
person
arrested
or
the
immediate
vicinity
from
which
he
might
reach
weapons
or
destructible
evidence.
any
search
beyond
the
immediate
person
or
the
immediate
vicinity
without
a
validly
issued
search
warrant
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
the
searcher?
i
think
that
there
is
other
doctrine
not
necessary
emanating
from
chimel
that
holds
that
if
the
officer
is
legally
on
the
premises,
he
may
seize
any
contraband
or
other
fruits
of
crime
that
are
visible
to
him.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
a
pistol,
yes.
now
in
chimel,
the
rule
of
that
case
was
applied
to
invalidate
a
search
of
an
entire
house
in
which
the
defendant
was
arrested.
in
the
present
case,
the
convict,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
the
basis
of
evidence
seized
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
when
the
rushing
officers
have
no
warrant.
he
was
arrested
in
his
apartment,
and
after
entry
into
the
apartment
and
arrest
of
petitioner,
the
arresting
officers
proceeded
to
search
throughout
the
apartment.
and
in
the
course
of
their
search,
they
uncovered
the
hidden
in
the
closets
and
kitchen
a
certain
evidence
that
was
material
to
petitioner’s
conviction.
now
concededly,
the
search
without
warrant
in
this
case
went
far
beyond
the
petitioner’s
person
or
the
immediate
vicinity
of
his
arrest,
and
the
government
makes
no
claim
now
to
makes
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
defined
in
chimel.
the
government
does
urge
however
that
the
search
here
ought
not
be
deemed
a
violation
of
the
standard
announced
in
chimel
because
there
were
exigent
circumstances
that
justified
a
broader
search
without
warrant,
then
when
otherwise
be
permitted
under
the
chimel
doctrine.
we
treat
this
point
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
--
it
warns
just
a
few
words
this
morning.
the
exigent
circumstances
alleged
here
by
the
government
where
that
the
petitioner’s
wife
was
present
in
the
apartment
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
and
that
she
might
disposed
of
incriminating
evidence
if
a
search
and
seizure
where
not
immediately
undertaken.
this
explanation
for
the
warrantless
search
is
virtually
identical
to
the
justification
for
a
similar
warrantless
search
of
a
dwelling
in
last
year’s
case
of
vale
against
louisiana.
the
argument
was
rejected
in
that
case.
there
the
court
held
that
the
requirement
for
a
warrant
for
a
search
of
a
dwelling
was
subject
only
to
a
few
well
recognized
exceptions,
and
that
the
asserted
justification
advanced
there
which
is
identical
to
the
one
advanced
here
did
not
fall
within
one
of
those
exceptions.
now,
the
government
contends
that
the
present
case
is
different
because
the
officers
here
were
concerned
that
petitioner
might
be
forewarned
of
his
an
imminent
arrest
and
flee,
and
that
this
justified
the
officers
in
making
the
arrest
and
the
search
without
first
securing
the
warrant.
now,
the
basis
of
this
claim
is
that
an
alleged
middleman
in
the
narcotics
dealings
in
which
petitioner
is
accused
was
in
custody
and
the
he
knew,
he
the
middleman,
knew
that
the
officials
were
seeking
his
supplier,
and
that
he
might
therefore
forewarn
his
supplier
by
telephone.
we
think
this
claim
to
be
insufficient
on
the
facts.
the
alleged
middleman
here
had
been
in
custody
for
two
days
prior
to
the
arrest
of
petitioner.
had
he
been
disposed
and
able
to
forewarn
his
supplier,
he
would
have
done
so
for
long
before
petitioner
was
arrested.
moreover,
it
does
not
seem
likely
to
us
that
the
middleman’s
captors
would
have
allowed
him
unrestricted
access
to
a
telephone
for
the
purpose
of
forewarning
accomplices
of
impending
arrest.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well
your
honor,
that’s
the
point
that
was
--
that
is
precisely
the
point
made
in
vale
by
the
arresting
officers
in
that
case.
and
the
court
said
that’s
an
insufficient
ground
for
not
securing
a
warrant
before
making
the
search.
and
that’s
exactly
the
point
we
make
here.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
no,
your
honor,
this
is
here
on
collateral
attack
--
this
is
collateral
review.
this
conviction
became
final
and
cert
was
denied
i
think
in
1967,
1964
excuse
me,
i’ll
correct
it.
in
short,
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
which
i’ll
leave,
the
government
--
we
don’t
believe
has
shown
that
the
arresting
officers
in
this
case
were
justified
in
searching
petitioner’s
apartment
without
first
securing
the
warrant.
we
think
at
beyond
serious
dispute
that
the
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
cannot
pass
master
under
the
standards
for
searches
incident
to
arrest
that
were
announced
in
the
chimel
case.
and
so
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
chimel
should
be
applied
retroactively
in
this
case
which
is
i
said
mr.
justice
harlan
arises
on
collateral
review
of
petitioner’s
conviction.
we
begin
with
the
basic
rule
of
weeks
against
united
states
and
its
progeny
that
a
physical
search
of
the
person
or
his
dwelling
must
be
pursuant
to
a
valid
search
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate
upon
a
showing
of
probable
cause.
now,
there
are
exceptions
to
this
principle.
one
of
which
is
that
a
search
warrant
may
be
conducted
as
--
a
search
may
be
conducted
as
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
this
court
typically
decides
several
cases
each
year
that
explicate
the
basic
week’s
rule
or
its
generally
recognized
exceptions.
no
one
would
reasonably
suggest
that
each
of
these
decisions
and
each
term
of
this
court
be
given
only
prospective
effect,
and
we
know
of
no
such
contention.
indeed,
the
government
here
concedes
that
this
result
of
automatic
prospectivity
might
result
in
an
intolerable
burden
of
sorting
out
the
effective
date
of
each
new
ones
of
the
basic
rules.
even
more
intolerable,
we
submit
would
be
a
regime
whereby
this
court
considered
separately,
and
each
of
these
many
fourth
amendment
cases
whether
to
apply
the
case
retroactively
or
prospectively.
and
yet,
we
recognized
that
the
court
in
recent
years
has
limited
application
of
some
of
its
criminal
procedure
decisions,
including
some
decisions
arising
under
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
provisions,
and
the
question
as
we
see
it
is
therefore
in
what
kind
of
case,
in
what
class
of
case
should
the
court
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
to
apply
a
criminal
procedure
decision
retroactively
or
prospectively?
linkletter
versus
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
it
was
prepared
in
my
office
as
stated
--
i
think,
we
stated
this
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
the
outset
of
the
argument
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
oh
no
sir,
it’s
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
as
we
indicated
here,
the
court
have
not
indicated
prior
to
this
time
a
time
we
follow
our
brief
a
disposition
to
review
the
entire
question
of
retroactivity.
so
we
didn’t
feel
that
an
extended
argument
on
the
point
was
forwarded
but
then
points
raised
in
the
appendix
did
seem
appropriate.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
it’s
also
help
to
sort
out
to
some
of
the
cases
and
the
argument
that
now
with
i
am
going
to
make
this
morning.
i
do
think
that
linkletter
versus
walker
which
is
the
root
case
in
this
area
does
not
answer
the
question
that
is
now
before
this
court
in
this
case
which
is
when
do
you
make
the
determination
of
retroactivity?
linkletter
versus
walker
sets
out
standards
for
deciding
the
question
when
the
question
is
presented
to
the
court.
it
doesn’t
reveal
when
that
question
is
appropriately
raised.
however,
we
think
that
upon
reviewing
some
of
the
retroactivity
decisions
including
those
set
forth
in
the
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
emerges
from
those
cases,
an
appropriate
test
as
to
when
the
question
of
retroactivity
ought
to
be
raised.
there
are
seven
instances
in
which
constitutional
decisions
have
not
been
given
fully
retroactive
effect.
each
of
these
decisions
involved
the
extension
of
a
constitutional
provision
to
a
wholly
new
area
of
activity
where
it
had
not
been
thought
previously
to
apply.
for
example
in
the
katz
case
which
was
given
retroactive,
i
mean
prospective
only
effect
in
desist.
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
extended
for
the
first
time
to
electronic
eavesdropping
or
nontrespassory
invasions
of
property
--
of
privacy.
now
in
miranda
and
escobedo
whose
backward
reach
was
limited
at
johnson
versus
new
jersey
the
right
to
counsel
and
police
interrogations
before
as
well
as
after
indictment
was
established
for
the
first
time,
and
in
the
way
gilbert
case
which
was
given
prospective
only
effect
in
stovall
the
right
to
counsel
and
lineups
was
announced
for
the
first
time.
similarly,
mapp
against
ohio
given
limited
retroactive
effect
in
linkletter
was
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
states
for
the
first
time.
the
jury
cases,
the
bloom
against
illinois
and
duncan
against
louisiana
which
were
given
prospective
only
effect
in
destefano,
those
cases
extended
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
all
state
cases
for
the
first
time.
finally,
the
griffin
case
which
was
given
prospective
only
the
effect
in
tehan
extended
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
provision
to
comments
by
the
judge
for
the
first
time.
all
of
these
cases
involved
in
the
extension
of
a
constitutional
provision
to
a
new
area
of
activity
where
it
have
not
previously
been
thought
to
apply.
however,
the
chimel
decision
which
is
before
us
today
is
of
a
very
different
nature
from
those
cases
that
i’ve
just
canvassed.
chimel
does
not
extend
the
fourth
amendment
to
an
area
of
activity
where
it
had
not
been
thought
previously
to
apply.
from
the
beginning
it
has
been
clear
that
physical
searches
must
meet
fourth
amendment
standards,
even
where
deemed
incident
to
a
valid
arrest
so
that
the
warrant
is
not
mandated,
a
physical
search
is
still
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
chimel
like
many
other
cases
simply
added
refinement
to
the
principle
of
law
that
searches
incident
to
a
valid
arrest
may
be
conducted
without
a
warrant.
chimel
dealt
with
the
dividing
line
between
searches
incident
to
arrest
and
which
need
not
be
accompanied
by
warrant.
and
those
that
meet
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
standard
because
--
i
think
i
said
it
wrong.
chimel
in
affect
dealt
with
the
dividing
line
between
searches
for
which
a
warrant
is
required,
and
those
for
which
a
warrant
is
not
required
but
which
otherwise
meet
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
of
standard.
as
a
result
of
chimel
a
dividing
line
was
moved
somewhat,
and
so
the
incident
to
arrest
doctrine
has
been
constrictive.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well
mr.
justice,
the
rationale
of
chimel
was
that
it
was
a
return
to
pre-rabinowitz
law,
and
i
would
--
without
having
made
a
careful
review
of
the
facts
of
each
case
prior
to
rabinowitz,
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
the
precise
--
whether
the
return
was
precisely
on
all
force
to
where
the
law
was
before
or
this
to
the
general
area
of
where
the
law
was
before.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
it
is
clear
in
the
context
in
which
i’ve
used
this
morning
that
chimel
did
not
represent
an
extension
of
the
constitution
to
a
new
area
of
activity.
even
where
an
arrest
was
incident
to
--
even
where
a
search
was
an
appropriate
incident
to
arrest,
whether
by
rabinowitz
standard
or
by
the
pre-rabinowitz
standard
or
by
the
chimel
standards,
it
was
still
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
still
had
to
meet
the
reasonableness
standard.
no
one
is
ever
suggested
that
a
physical
search
was
wholly
unrelated
to
the
fourth
amendment.
actually,
we
think
that
chimel
does
not
really
differ
at
all
from
other
decisions
of
this
court,
recent
decision
in
which
retroactive
application
has
been
assumed,
and
the
car
search
cases
are
good
example.
they
also
happen
to
deal
with
the
incident
to
arrest
doctrine.
in
the
preston
case
in
376
u.s.,
the
court
ruled
that
a
search
of
a
car
is
police
custody
after
the
driver
had
been
removed
and
placed
in
jail
was
too
remote
to
be
considered
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
and
consequently,
a
warrant
was
required.
but
last
term
in
chambers
against
maroney,
the
court
held
in
almost
identical
factual
circumstances
that
the
car
search
there
was
incident
to
arrest.
now,
i
don’t
believe
it’s
contended
by
anyone
seriously
that
the
chambers
case
should
not
be
given
retroactive
effect
and
that
the
stricter
preston
rule
should
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
i
understand
that
i
am
going
to
point
out
later.
the
court
in
dealing
with
preston
and
the
chambers
case
sought
to
distinguish
preston,
and
i
want
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
a
--
distinguishing
cases
is
one
way
of
limiting
their
application,
as
just
as
overruling
a
past
precedent
in
other
way.
but
another
illustration
of
the
point
i
now
make
is
the
warden
against
hayden
in
387
u.s.,
and
i
think,
this
is
perhaps
even
more
appropriate
example.
here
is
a
case
where
the
prevailing
doctrine
that
seizure
of
mere
evidence
of
crime
was
not
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
rejected.
there
had
been
a
doctrine
that
police
could
search
and
seize
instrumentalities
and
fruits
of
crime,
but
not
“mere
evidence.”
well,
this
court
rejected
that
distinction
in
the
warden
against
hayden
case.
yet
i
know
of
no
suggestion
that
warden
against
hayden
should
be
applied
only
prospectively
with
the
earlier
mere
evidence
rule
left
on
the
books
to
apply
the
cases
that
annotated
warden.
now,
these
examples
and
others
i
think
illustrate
ebb
and
flow
in
the
--
that
is
characteristic
of
decisions
interpreting
the
fourth
amendment,
and
chimel
is
like
those
cases.
it
can’t
be
distinguished
from
them
and
unless
there
are
to
be
limits
on
the
applicability
of
every
fourth
amendment
decision,
an
approach
that
i
think
would
admittedly
wreak
havoc
with
the
administration
of
justice.
there
can
be
no
reason
to
basis
for
limiting
the
application
of
chimel.
it
maybe
suggested
that
chimel
is
different
because
it
expressly
overruled
to
prior
precedent,
the
rabinowitz
and
harris
cases,
and
this
i
think
comes
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
white
was
touching
on.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
would
not
be
a
meaningful
distinction
of
the
chimel
decision
from
the
other
myriad
of
fourth
amendment
decisions
announced
every
year
by
this
court.
many
of
the
court’s
decision
have
the
effect
of
dissipating
earlier
precedents.
sometimes,
it’s
done
by
an
express
overruling.
sometimes
by
distinguishing
a
case
out
of
existence
or
distinguishing
it
in
a
way
that
narrowly
limits
its
ambit.
sometimes
cases
are
discarded
without
mention
at
all,
and
chambers
is
a
good
example
because
there,
the
court
did
not
purport
to
overrule
preston,
but
conceded
--
but
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
chambers
decision
narrows
the
reach
of
preston;
there
can’t
be
too
much
left
to
preston
after
chambers.
indeed,
the
vale
decision
of
last
term
which
i
mentioned
earlier
provides
a
sort
of
different
illustration
to
this
point.
vale
refused
to
permit
a
search
without
warrant
of
a
dwelling
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest
of
the
man
standing
on
the
front
steps
of
the
door.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
yes.
there
was
a
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
he
was
somewhere
outside
the
front
door
of
his
house.
he
may
have
been
as
far
as
all
the
way
to
the
street.
he
may
have
been
one
step
in
the
front
door.
he
was
on
the
threshold
or
close
to
it.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
indeed.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that’s
right.
now
the
principle
of
that
case
cannot
be
consistent
with
the
underpinnings
of
rabinowitz
in
harris
which
were
that
you
can
--
as
an
incident
to
arrest,
search
any
place
within
the
control
of
the
person
arrested,
certainly
in
that
situation,
his
house
was
within
his
control.
had
chimel
not
intervened
to
overrule
rabinowitz
and
put
it
aside?
it
clearly
would
have
been
said
that
vale
eroded
the
most,
if
not
all
of
the
basis
of
rabinowitz.
yet,
there
is
no
indication
that
vale
is
to
be
applied
prospectively
only.
it’s
simply
another
in
the
continuum
of
cases,
that
add
judicial
interpretation
to
the
meaning
of
the
basic
rule
that
physical
searches
must
be
made
pursuant
to
warrant
except
were
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
yet,
it
would
be
quite
anomalous
to
hold
that
chimel
which
involve
a
search
without
a
warrant
after
arrest
just
inside
the
door
is
not
to
be
given
retroactive
effect,
if
vale
which
involve
a
search
without
warrant
after
arrest
just
outside
the
door
is
to
be
given
retroactive
effect.
the
point
is
that
there
is
nothing
unique
about
the
expressed
overruling
of
a
prior
precedent
that
would
warrant
limiting
the
effect
of
a
particular
new
decision.
and
we
think
the
gideon
case
and
jackson
against
denno
both
of
which
expressly
overruled
prior
precedents
yet
both
of
which
enjoy
full
retroactive
application.
our
further
indicate
that
there
is
no
necessary
requirement
that
a
decision
which
overrules
past
precedent
be
given
only
prospective
effect.
now,
the
government
in
this
brief
has
asserted
a
different
test
for
determining
when
to
consider,
limiting
the
application
of
new
procedural
due
process
rulings
and
the
government’s
test
is
whether
the
new
decision
is
a
landmark
decision.
and
if
it
is
landmark
the
court
then
may
consider
given
it
prospective
only
effect.
that’s
the
government
position
on
page
45.
with
all
respect,
we
submit
that
this
distinction
afford
no
real
standard.
the
term
landmark
is
not
an
objective
standard
and
provides
no
basis
for
distinguishing
cases.
it
cannot
be
said
for
example
that
chambers
which
altered
the
prevailing
law
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
search
of
a
car
incident
to
an
arrest
is
more
or
less
a
landmark
decision
then
chimel
which
altered
the
prevailing
law
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
search
of
a
house
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest.
the
rubric
landmark
does
not
answer
the
question
at
issue
which
is
to
what
class
of
cases
should
the
court
consider
given
prospective
on
the
application.
we
submit
the
only
objective
distinction
that
can
be
drawn
that
has
an
effect
been
drawn
in
the
cases
today
is
between
rulings
extending
the
fourth
amendment
and
other
constitutional
decision
to
new
areas
of
activity
where
they
were
previously
not
applied
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
rulings
that
merely
explicate
the
meaning
of
a
constitutional
provision
without
extending
it
to
a
new
area
of
activity.
the
office
of
the
linkletter
and
desist
line
of
cases
ought
to
be
limited
to
those
constitutional
decisions
where
the
constitution
has
been
extended
to
new
areas
of
activity.
for
this
other
cases,
the
traditional
rule
of
full
retroactive
application
should
be
observed
for
any
other
rule
for
these
cases
would
ultimately
lead
to
chaos
and
destruction
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
i
can
see
that
what
your,
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
your
question
suggests
is
that
what
maybe
reasonable
in
1950
may
on
the
same
effects
be
unreasonable
in
1960?
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
that
maybe
so
but
if
that
where
the
case
then
how
can
one
explain
the
chimel
decision
when
the
officer
was
acting
reasonably
by
the
standard
of
you
just
suggested
because
in
accord
--
acting
in
accordance
with
the
rabinowitz
case
which
was
on
the
books
as
of
the
time
of
the
search
in
chimel.
i
realized
that
you
may
say,
“well,
we
have
to
decide
cases
and
that’s
one
of
the
prices
we
pay
for
deciding
cases.”
but
i
suggest
at
that
that
is
not
a
complete
answer.
i
suggest
it
indeed
that
answer
carries
a
seized
of
a
broader
answer
to
your
question.
there
are
--
chimel
happen
to
be
convenient
and
that
involved
a
past
precedent
which
was
expressly
overruled.
in
the
whole
range
of
fourth
amendment
cases,
there
are
many
cases
that
do
not
present
on
all
force.
facts
that
previously
even
before
this
court
infinite
gradations
of
reasonableness
are
presented
in
every
case
if
--
and
if
an
officer
could
by
some
hindsight
justification
point
to
some
earlier
decision
of
the
courts
from
which
it
could
be
interpreted
that
his
action
was
reasonable.
under
the
suggestion
that
you
just
made
that
would
automatically
result
an
affirmance.
i
think
with
all
respect
to
mr.
justice
that
the
reasonableness
term
is
not
quite
that
elastic
in
the
fourth
amendment
area.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
mr.
justice,
i
haven’t
attempted
in
our
brief
to
go
into
an
extended
discussion
of
that
obviously
point
of
finality
because
it’s
been
canvass
so
thoroughly
by
this
court
in
recent
decisions
in
such
as
kaufman
and
others.
and
there
are
differences
of
opinion
on
them
as
you’re
well
aware.
kaufman
i
think
establishes
the
proposition
that
whatever
else
maybe
said.
notions
of
finality
under
layer
earlier
decisions
to
this
court
are
not
to
be
given
the
same
effect,
the
same
exalted
position
as
they
once
were.
finality
isn’t
important
but
this
cut
across
all
cases
involving
retroactivity
questions
as
against
finality
are
the
--
is
the
interest
in
maintaining
in
prison
or
in
custody,
one
who
has
been
convicted
in
ways
which
we
now
determine
are
contrary
to
the
constitution.
and
i
think
that
question
is
not
unique
to
chimel
but
it
arises
in
every
case
in
which
retroactivity
questions
arise.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i'm
sure
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you.
i
think
indeed
that’s
the
point
i've
tried
to
assert
this
morning.
when
there
is
a
distinction
that
is
marked,
landmark
or
whatever
word
you
want
--
adjective
you
want
to
apply
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
what
i'm
suggesting
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
mere
adjective
like
marked,
landmark
important
or
other
rubric
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
would
say
no
your
honor,
not
i
would
--
if
the
result
is
to
extend
the
constitutional
provision
to
a
new
area
where
it
had
not
previously
been
applied
that
i
would
say,
yes.
but
i
change
that
simply
--
i
change
as
in
chimel
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
marked
changed
but
is
concededly
a
change.
i
would
say
no
because
once
you
agree
that
a
change
in
the
law
is
--
gives
rise
to
prospectivity
or
the
possibility
of
it.
you
inevitably
led
to
the
regime
where
every
case
must
be
reviewed
for
prospective
or
retroactive
application
because
this
court
by
definition
practically
every
case
changes
the
law
to
some
extent.
this
court
doesn’t
sit
on
typical
cases.
it
sits
on
cases
at
the
edge
of
the
law.
it
extends
or
contracts.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i’d
say
that
the
certainly
in
the
fourth
amendment
cases,
i
agree
with
you.
candor
compels
to
agree
with
you.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
all
in
the
case
set
in
two
ways
if
i
may.
first,
i
think
we
--
there
may
be
some
tendency
to
exalt
this
notion
of
official
reliance
on
the
decision
of
this
court
and
especially
it
is
true
in
an
area
like
the
incident
to
arrest
area
which
is
typified
by
decisions
like
rabinowitz
which
say
that
each
case
return
on
its
own
facts.
and
that
the
circumstances
must
govern
in
every
case
and
we
can
make
no
real
hard
and
fast
rules.
we’ve
quoted
the
language
from
rabinowitz
in
our
brief
which
seems
to
me
to
suggests
that
the
--
we
can
carry
at
least
perhaps
to
some
reasonable
extremes
the
notion
that
officers
were
relying
on
supreme
court
decisions
every
time
they
take
an
action
in
this
area.
but
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
notion,
the
question
that
you’ve
just
raised
is
typical
of
the
questions
that
are
asked
when
one
is
applying
the
linkletter
versus
walker
standards.
that’s
one
the
questions
that
is
discussed
in
every
case.
we
suggest
that
linkletter
versus
walker
standards,
a
linkletter
versus
walker
analysis
need
not
and
ought
not
be
made
in
every
criminal
decisions
of
this
court
because
of
the
destructive
effects
that
it
would
have
--
that
would
ensue.
and
so
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
linkletter
versus
walker
type
of
analysis
ought
to
be
limited
to
a
certain
class
of
cases
and
i've
tried
this
morning
to
set
out
the
class
of
cases
which
i
think
it
is
here
before
been
limited
and
which
ought
to
be
limited
in
the
future.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
