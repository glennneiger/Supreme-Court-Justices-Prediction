mr.
henry
j.
florence
thank
you
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
williams
case
we
have,
involves
two
questions
which
are
presented
to
the
court.
one
involves
again
the
question
of
chimel
and
retroactivity.
the
and
i
believe
the
us
government
has
agreed
that
there’s
no
question
about
it,
that
this
search
did
in
fact
violate
the
dictate
in
chimel.
but
because
of
the
second
question
presented
namely
of
the
--
which
we
presented
all
the
way
along,
namely
the
fact
that
this
search
was
a
merely
pretext
and
violate
even
pre-chimel
law,
we
will
have
to
go
into
the
facts
itself.
again,
it
should
be
noted
that
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
conviction
in
the
federal
court.
the
facts
are
such
that
on
march
9,
1967,
the
defendant
was
alleged
to
have
sold
heroine
to
a
federal
narcotics
agent.
a
warrant
was
issued
approximately
three
weeks
later.
during
this
period
of
time,
there
was
constant
surveillance
made
of
the
residence
in
question
and
nothing
was
observed
of
an
extraordinary
nature
except
the
fact
that
it
appeared
that
two
people
were
living
there,
the
defendant
and
a
woman,
who
later,
again,
turned
out
to
be
a
common
law
wife,
were
obviously
living
in
the
residence
itself.
later
on,
evidence
indicated
that
utility
bills
and
so
forth
were
in
name
of
the
woman,
there
was
nothing
found
in
the
name
of
the
man
himself.
a
--
after
the
warrant
was
obtained,
a
meeting
was
held
and
which
involves
approximately
at
least
nine
police
officers.
there
is
testimony
in
the
motion
to
suppressed
that
there
was
specific
discussions
occurred
about
the
manner
in
which
they
will
be
going
to
search
the
house.
in
other
words,
the
police
had
full
intentions
of
arresting
the
defendant
in
his
home
and
there
upon
searching
the
house.
now,
this
particular
evidence
is
contradicted
by
the
testimony
of
three
other
police
officers
who
denied
this
happened,
but
we
still
have
the
discrepancy
between
the
testimony
of
the
two
police
officers.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
the
court
--
the
ninth
circuits
specifically
found
that
the
--
that
they
would
believe
the
majority
of
the
most
of
the
police
officers
and
specifically
held
at
this
was
not
the
intention
of
the
police
in
their
findings.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
yes,
i
am
still
raising
a
question
about
the
findings
mr.
chief
justice.
the
nine
police
officers
proceeded
to
the
home
of
the
defendant
where
they
knocked
on
the
door
and
he
was
observed
in
the
living
of
the
house
in
his
underclothing
eating
some
dinner.
the
lady
in
question
was
also,
opened
the
door
for
the
police
upon
there
knock.
there
was
no
forcible
entry
required.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
arrest
warrant
--
mr.
henry
j.
florence
--
no,
no
search
warrant
at
all.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
no,
it
did
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
she
become
a
co-defendant
and
later
of
the
ninth
circuit
again
dismissed
the
conviction
as
to
her
--
mr.
henry
j.
florence
--
reversed
it.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
did
not
named
her.
the
--
upon
entering
the
house,
the
officers
immediately
without
delay
went
into
the
other
rooms
of
the
house.
in
fact,
there’s
testimony,
they
came
in
through
the
back
door
and
through
the
side
doors
and
so
forth,
and
they
proceeded
to
search
the
residence
for
approximately
two
hours.
in
a
three-bedroom
house,
in
the
northeast
bedroom
of
the
house,
they
found
a
container,
a
large
can
in
a
closet
which
turned
out
to
contain
heroine
and
from
which
both
parties
in
the
house
were
charged
with
the
crime
of
possession
of
heroine.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
there
was
a
storage
room
which
was
search
immediately
adjoining
the
house,
there
was
a
kitchen,
a
living
room,
dinning
room
combination
also
that
was
searched.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
about
six
rooms
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
six,
seven
rooms,
including
a
bathroom
up.
as
near
as
we
can
determine
there
were
nine
police
officers
involved
in
this
particular
case.
the
--
at
the
motion
to
suppress
which
was
argued
on
january
12th
in
the
us
district
court
in
phoenix,
arizona,
we
specifically
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
search
which
went
far
beyond
the
dictates
of
harris
and
rabinowitz.
we
also
argued
that
the
search
was
a
mere
pretext
and
in
fact
that
our
whole
motion
is
suppressed
was
based
upon
this
premise.
again,
when
we
appealed
the
conviction
to
the
ninth
circuit,
we
again
specifically
eluded
to
the
fact
of
the
pretext
and
the
fact
that
it
was
our
feeling
that
search
violated
the
rabinowitz
and
harris.
when
the
chimel
case
came
out,
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
requested
before
the
memoranda
with
reference
to
the
retroactivity
of
chimel
and
after
making
that
finding,
they
specifically
found
that
the
search
involved
did
violate
chimel.
however,
they
said
that
it
was
not
retroactive
and
therefore
they
affirmed
the
conviction
of
the
defendant
and
we
came
up
here
on
certiorari
and
hence
we
are
here.
the
first
issue
i’d
like
to
present
to
the
court
on
retroactivity.
it
would
seem
to
be
that
we
have
a
situation
where
if
mr.
williams
--
if
mr.
chimel
had
not
been
so
fortunate
to
arrive
here
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
before
us,
we
might
very
well
be
here
today
arguing
the
same
matters
that
were
argued
in
front
of
us
--
in
front
of
the
court
by
chimel
and
very
well
have
a
ruling
consistent
with
chimel
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
and
in
a
effect
by
refusing
to
give
retroactivity
to
this
particular
case
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
federal
court,
we
are
creating
an
equity
in
the
law
in
that
we
are
differentiating
between
merely
because
a
man
has
not
been
as
fast
as
someone
else
in
coming
here
to
supreme
court
of
united
states.
it
is
felt
that
all
the
cases
in
which
and
this
is
supreme
court
has
heard
many
times
and
which
--
all
the
cases
and
which
strictly
a
prospective
application
has
been
made,
our
cases
of
new
law
and
new
areas.
and
again,
it's
we
submit
that
in
this
particular
case,
and
that
chimel
is
not
a
new
area
in
that,
it
just
in
effect
advised
law
enforcement
authorities
of
what
is
reasonable,
what
is
a
reasonable
search
incidental
to
an
arrest?
harris
came
out
and
then
the
court
later
on
in
trepino
specifically
overruled
harris
and
again
specifically
held
that
the
search
incidental
to
an
arrest
should
be
strictly
construed.
rabinowitz,
in
the
language
of
rabinowitz
which
is
specifically
holds
that
rabinowitz
is
to
be
considered
on
its
facts
that
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
is
to
be
considered
by
all
of
facts
and
circumstances
arriving
at
that
particular
situation.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
facts
and
situation
in
this
particular
case
were
such
that
the
fact
situation
that
they
did
not
violate
so
to
speak
the
dictates
of
rabinowitz
in
this
particular
search.
in
rabinowitz,
there
was
a
one
room
office,
there
was
arrest
warrant.
the
search
is
for
an
hour-and-a-half
and
there
was
a
public
place
with
exclusive
possession
in
the
part
of
rabinowitz.
in
our
particular
case,
we
had
a
private
home,
the
government
was
not
able
to
establish
who
owned
the
home,
who
actually
had
possession
of
the
home.
the
search
lasted
for
over
two
hours
with
an
arrest
warrant
and
approximately
seven
homes
were
searched,
seven
--
i
would
say
that
this
particular
case
in
facts
situation
is
closer
to
the
von
cleef
in
which
the
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
it
was
a
illegal
search
pursuant
the
harris,
rabinowitz
rule.
and
for
that
reason,
they
–
if
the
court
should
deem
that
retroactivity
should
not
be
applied
in
this
particular
case
that
it
would
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
even
without
the
ruling
of
chimel
.i
believe
that
the
--
again,
the
question
of
retroactivity,
the
closest
case
i
can
really
come
to,
it
is
the
spinelli
case
in
which
i
think
there’s
no
doubt
about
it
that
no
one
argues
as
to
retroactivity
of
spinelli.
i
think
spinelli
again
took
the
search
warrant
in
the
narcotics
case
and
expressed
what
would
be
required,
what
is
required
to
show
probable
cause
to
a
magistrate?
i
believe
chimel
has
merely
stated
what
is
necessary
what
is
probable
cause,
what
is
the
basis
for
a
search
incidental
to
an
arrest,
and
the
similarity
between
the
two
are
quite
close.
neither
one
is
--
sets
up
new
law
such
as
the
tight
desist
opinion
which
in
effect
says
that
katz
is
--
will
not
be
replied
retroactive
and
it’s
quite
clear
that
before
katz
electronics
eavesdropping
was
allowed
although
the
court
was
starting
to
mitigate
it
in
many
aspects,
but
it’s
still
is
allowed
in
this
particular
session
just
do
without
completely.
i
think
mr.
miller
has
covered
that
in
his
appendix
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief
quite
excellently
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
direct
appeal,
on
view
of
the
fact
that
we
specifically
argued
chimel
two
years
before
chimel
ever
came
out
that
in
a
fact
if
the
what
--
if
the
court
denied
our
request
at
this
time
then,
in
effect
what
the
court
would
have
to
say
is
if
the
ninth
circuit
or
in
effect
if
the
lower
court
had
granted
our
motion
and
the
government
in
someway
and
a
motion
is
suppress
which
that
they
have
a
right
to
appeal
could
come
up
and
say,
object
to
it
and
argue
that
it
was
not
a
valid
ruling
by
the
trial
court.
i
think
this
would
be
ludicrous
and
yet
because
the
trial
court
so
to
speak
goofed,
did
not
follow
the
law
the
way
it
should
have
been
because
we
arrived
approximately
a
year
after
chimel
before
this
court
we
are
based
with
the
different
decision.
i
don’t
think
and
i
don’t
feel
that
this
is
equal
protection
in
law
which
should
be
given
--
being
given
to
mr.
williams.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
thank
you
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
williams
case
we
have,
involves
two
questions
which
are
presented
to
the
court.
one
involves
again
the
question
of
chimel
and
retroactivity.
the
and
i
believe
the
us
government
has
agreed
that
there’s
no
question
about
it,
that
this
search
did
in
fact
violate
the
dictate
in
chimel.
but
because
of
the
second
question
presented
namely
of
the
--
which
we
presented
all
the
way
along,
namely
the
fact
that
this
search
was
a
merely
pretext
and
violate
even
pre-chimel
law,
we
will
have
to
go
into
the
facts
itself.
again,
it
should
be
noted
that
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
conviction
in
the
federal
court.
the
facts
are
such
that
on
march
9,
1967,
the
defendant
was
alleged
to
have
sold
heroine
to
a

narcotics
agent.
a

was
issued
approximately
three
weeks
later.
during

later
on,

so
forth
were

of

there
was
nothing
found

the

of
the
man
himself.
a
--
after
the
warrant
was
obtained,
a
meeting
was
held
and
which
involves
approximately
at
least
nine
police
officers.
there
is
testimony
in
the
motion
to
suppressed
that
there
was
specific
discussions
occurred
about
the

in

now,
this
particular

is
contradicted

of
three
other
police
officers
who
denied
this

but
we
still
have
the
discrepancy

the
testimony
of
the
two
police
officers.
mr.
henry

the

mr.

j.
florence
yes,
i
am
still
raising
a
question
about
the
findings
mr.
chief

the
nine
police

proceeded
to
the
home
of
the
defendant
where
they
knocked
on
the
door
and
he
was

in

reversed

mr.

the

upon

the

immediately
without

would
seem
to
be
that
we
have
a
situation
where
if
mr.
williams
--
if
mr.
chimel
had
not
been
so
fortunate
to
arrive
here
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
before
us,
we
might
very
well
be
here
today
arguing
the
same
matters
that
were
argued
in
front
of
us
--
in
front
of
the
court
by
chimel
and
very
well
have
a
ruling
consistent
with
chimel
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
and
in
a
effect
by
refusing
to
give
retroactivity
to
this
particular
case
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
federal
court,
we
are
creating
an
equity
in
the
law
in
that
we
are
differentiating
between
merely
because
a
man
has
not
been
as
fast
as
someone
else
in
coming
here
to
supreme
court
of
united
states.
it
is
felt
that
all
the
cases
in
which
and
this
is
supreme
court
has
heard
many
times
and
which
--
all
the
cases
and
which
strictly
a
prospective
application
has
been
made,
our
cases
of
new
law
and
new
areas.
and
again,
it's
we
submit
that
in
this
particular
case,
and
that
chimel
is
not
a
new
area
in
that,
it
just
in
effect
advised
law
enforcement
authorities
of
what
is
reasonable,
what
is
a
reasonable
search
incidental
to
an
arrest?
harris
came
out
and
then
the
court
later
on
in
trepino
specifically
overruled
harris
and
again
specifically
held
that
the
search
incidental
to
an
arrest
should
be
strictly
construed.
rabinowitz,
in
the
language
of
rabinowitz
which
is
specifically
holds
that
rabinowitz
is
to
be
considered
on
its
facts
that
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
is
to
be
considered
by
all
of
facts
and
circumstances
arriving
at
that
particular
situation.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
facts
and
situation
in
this
particular
case
were
such
that
the
fact
situation
that
they
did
not
violate
so
to
speak
the
dictates
of
rabinowitz
in
this
particular
search.
in
rabinowitz,
there
was
a
one
room
office,
there
was
arrest
warrant.
the
search
is
for
an
hour-and-a-half
and
there
was
a
public
place
with
exclusive
possession
in
the
part
of
rabinowitz.
in
our
particular
case,
we
had
a
private
home,
the
government
was
not
able
to
establish
who
owned
the
home,
who
actually
had
possession
of
the
home.
the
search
lasted
for
over
two
hours
with
an
arrest
warrant
and
approximately
seven
homes
were
searched,
seven
--
i
would
say
that
this
particular
case
in
facts
situation
is
closer
to
the
von
cleef
in
which
the
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
it
was
a
illegal
search
pursuant
the
harris,
rabinowitz
rule.
and
for
that
reason,
they
–
if
the
court
should
deem
that
retroactivity
should
not
be
applied
in
this
particular
case
that
it
would
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
was
an
illegal
search
even
without
the
ruling
of
chimel
.i
believe
that
the
--
again,
the
question
of
retroactivity,
the
closest
case
i
can
really
come
to,
it
is
the
spinelli
case
in
which
i
think
there’s
no
doubt
about
it
that
no
one
argues
as
to
retroactivity
of
spinelli.
i
think
spinelli
again
took
the
search
warrant
in
the
narcotics
case
and
expressed
what
would
be
required,
what
is
required
to
show
probable
cause
to
a
magistrate?
i
believe
chimel
has
merely
stated
what
is
necessary
what
is
probable
cause,
what
is
the
basis
for
a
search
incidental
to
an
arrest,
and
the
similarity
between
the
two
are
quite
close.
neither
one
is
--
sets
up
new
law
such
as
the
tight
desist
opinion
which
in
effect
says
that
katz
is
--
will
not
be
replied
retroactive
and
it’s
quite
clear
that
before
katz
electronics
eavesdropping
was
allowed
although
the
court
was
starting
to
mitigate
it
in
many
aspects,
but
it’s
still
is
allowed
in
this
particular
session
just
do
without
completely.
i
think
mr.
miller
has
covered
that
in
his
appendix
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief
quite
excellently
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
direct
appeal,
on
view
of
the
fact
that
we
specifically
argued
chimel
two
years
before
chimel
ever
came
out
that
in
a
fact
if
the
what
--
if
the
court
denied
our
request
at
this
time
then,
in
effect
what
the
court
would
have
to
say
is
if
the
ninth
circuit
or
in
effect
if
the
lower
court
had
granted
our
motion
and
the
government
in
someway
and
a
motion
is
suppress
which
that
they
have
a
right
to
appeal
could
come
up
and
say,
object
to
it
and
argue
that
it
was
not
a
valid
ruling
by
the
trial
court.
i
think
this
would
be
ludicrous
and
yet
because
the
trial
court
so
to
speak
goofed,
did
not
follow
the
law
the
way
it
should
have
been
because
we
arrived
approximately
a
year
after
chimel
before
this
court
we
are
based
with
the
different
decision.
i
don’t
think
and
i
don’t
feel
that
this
is
equal
protection
in
law
which
should
be
given
--
being
given
to
mr.
williams.
mr.
henry
j.
florence
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
