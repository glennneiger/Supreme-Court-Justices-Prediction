against
the

mr.
florence,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
there
is
a
finding
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
case,
you’re
not
raising
any
question
about
that
finding
or
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
the
three-bedroom
house.
how
--
what’s
the
rest
of
the
description
of
the
house?
how
many
rooms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
again
about?
chief

warren
e.

six,
seven
rooms
there.
chief

thank
you

let

put

your
in
another
way
mr.
springer.
if
we
were
today
arguing
chimel
and
this
case,
do
you
think
they
would
both
have
the
same
disposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
had
the
police
known
that
this
was
his
base
of
operations
or
one
of
his
bases
of
operations,
would
you
indicated
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
springer.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
florence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
argument
in
number
82,
elkanich
against
the
united
states.
mr.
miller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
encompass
anything
that
he

does

the

the

chief

warren
e.

pistol
or
an
apple?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
was
a
little
dispute
about
where
he
was
then,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact,
these
weren’t
very
clear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
certainly
on
the
figure
to
the
threshold
of
going
into
his
house
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
on
the
physical
threshold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miller,
i'm
sure
you’d
agree
that
if
we
have
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
in
far
more
conventional
way,
we’ll
make
constitution
amendments
like
recent
ones.
there
would
be
no
questions
about
retroactivity
of
that
amendment
unless
by
its
terms
is
done
which
isn’t
very
often
likely,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
if
the
court
makes
a
marked
change,
a
marked
change,
in
the
thrust
and
scope
of
constitution.
why
should
the
rule
be
any
different
having
in
mind
justice
stewart’s
suggestion
about
official
reliance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
just
want
to
use
landmark.
that’s
use
maybe
a
word
not
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
said
marked
change
not
marked
opinion,
a
marked
change
in
the
thrust
and
scope
of
an
existing
provision
of
the
constitution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mentioned
that
following
the
same
rule
of
prospectivity
as
formal
and
official
amendments
to
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
over
the
years,
hasn’t
it
been
a
dominant
rationale,
all
the
exclusion
doctrine
that
it’s
to
deter
official
governmental
conduct
which
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
statutes?
the
deterrence
concept
isn’t
that
--
isn’t
that
the
most
constant
threads
through
all
the
exclusion
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
how
do
you
--
how
does
the
deterrence
concept
come
in
again
picking
up
justice
stewart’s
point?
how
does
the
deterrence
concept
come
into
play
when
the
action
as
taken
by
the
officer
at
the
time
under
rabinowitz
prior
interpretations
was
perfectly
covered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
miller.
mr.
springer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miller
pointed
out
that
the
court
--
this
court
in
vale
last
year
appears
at
least
to
have
rejected
the
idea
of
the
practical
considerations
are
of
no
concern
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
i
take
his
argument
to
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
springer,
i
think
you
have
the
podium.
you
may
continue
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
your
hypothesis
mr.
springer
as
to
what
officers
would
do
if
having
arrived
there
as
was
the
case
in
the
vale
against
louisiana
last
year?
and
then
undertook
to
try
to
freeze
the
status
code
while
they
sent
one
or
more
men
off
to
get
a
warrant.
what
will
ultimately
the
officers
do
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence
to
prevent
the
flight
or
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
springer
i
think
you
would
--
at
least
i
understood
you
do
agree
with
justice
marshall’s
suggestion
at
least
by
inference
that
there
can’t
be
a
difference
in
terms
of
amendment,
in
terms
of
the
constitution
on
the
aspect
of
the
dangers
this
courts
but
in
terms
of
evaluating
the
reasonableness,
you
did
suggest
television
sets
which
couldn’t
be
disposed
variously
but
taken
extreme.
now,
with
the
requirements
of
getting
a
warrant
perhaps
not
be
more
stringent
if
a
man
was
accused
of
stealing
trailer
trucks
as
distinguished
from
gambling
slips,
counterfeit
money
or
narcotics,
all
of
which
can
be
destroyed
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
is
does
that
enter
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
question
reasonableness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
it
which
would
go
is
lay
down
in
front
of
the
trailer
truck
until
his
colleagues
got
there
with
a
warrant
whereas
he
couldn’t
trace
the
situation
on
narcotics
with
counterfeit
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
springer.
your
time
has
exhausted
mr.
miller
but
let
me
say
you
acted
by
appointment
of
the
court

that
the
request
of
the

officer
of

you
for
your
assistance
to

defendant
and
to
the

mr.
florence,
you
may

chief

there
is
a

chief

e.

in
any
case,
you’re
not
raising
any
question
about
that
finding

are
you?
