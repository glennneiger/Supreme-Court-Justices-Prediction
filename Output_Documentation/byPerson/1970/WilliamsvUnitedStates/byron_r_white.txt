justice

mr.
springer,
i
take
it
your
claim
firmly
is
however
that
under
pre-chimel
law
the
search
was
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
under
pre-chimel
law
that
if
you
arrested
a
man
for
stealing
television
sets
and
you
arrested
him
in
his
own
house
and
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
television
sets
might
be
there
that
you
can
search
for
television
sets,
but
you
can
also
search
sealed
envelops
found
in
the
dresser
drawer,
would
take
him
along?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
others
have
a
probable
cause
of
search
and
the
officer
doesn’t
get
a
warrant
when
he
should
have
and
the
case
is
reversed,
the
conviction
is
reversed.
you
say
that
officers
cannot
then
get
a
warrant
to
seize
the
same
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s

well,
what
interest
do
you
