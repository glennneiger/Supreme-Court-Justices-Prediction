no

stewart
and
did
the
arrest
warrant
authorized
the
arrest
not

of
the
petitioner,

arlene
jackson

not?

she
did
become

didn’t
she?
justice

reversed
it?
justice

but
the
arrest
warrant
did
not
name
her?
justice

of
course,
as
mr.
justice
black
says
in
the
chimel
case
itself
that
wouldn’t
unless,
i
mean
given
those
views
that
would
not
lead
to
reversal
of
this
case,
would
it?
justice

you
say
there
was
the

you
mean
don’t
say
here
that
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
search
for
anything?
justice

is
this

this
is
here
on
direct
review
of.
justice
potter
stewart
while
you
pause
a
moment,
may
i
ask
you
perhaps
in
the
brief,
but
i
missed
it.
what
is
the
--
who
is
the
author
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief,
the
memorandum?
justice
potter
stewart
it
probably
is,
i
guess
it’s
not
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
a
published
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
one
on
factor
in
a
fourth
amendment
case
is
different
it
seems
to
me
and
considering
the
question
of
retroactivity
from
what
it
might
be
in
right
to
counsel
cases
of
something
else
and
that
is
the
--
because
the
fourth
amendment
talks
about
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
and
then
the
question
becomes,
is
it
unreasonable
search
or
seizure,
if
a
law
enforcement
officer
makes
a
search
or
seizure
relying
on
the
settled
law
as
of
the
time
he
makes
the
search
or
seizure.
in
other
words,
it
says
that
even
a
constitutional
violation
and
for
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
make
a
an
arrest
and
then
incident
search
and
seizure
in
reliance
on
the
settled
law
then
on
the
books
i.e.
harris
and
rabinowitz
--
harris
and
rabinowitz
is
not
even
a
constitutional
violation
because
it
is
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
it
adds
a
little
complication
to
the
simple
question
of
retroactivity
in
the
fourth
amendment
case,
does
it
not?
just
simply
because
of
the
wording
in
fourth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
that
certainly
a
difficult
to
say
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
is
acting
unreasonably
when
he
is
acting
in
accord
the
then
decisional
law
of
this
court
under
the
fourth
amendment,
is
it
not?
