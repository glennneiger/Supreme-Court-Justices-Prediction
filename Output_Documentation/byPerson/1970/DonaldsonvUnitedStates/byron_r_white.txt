what
if
he
--
what
if
it
had
a,
would
you
be
here,
would
you
still
be
wanting
--
i
suppose
you
would
still
be
asserting
that
you
would
have
a
right
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
urging
here,
(inaudible)
intervention
point
or
that
the
--
or
that
if
you
are
in
then
you
would've
had
a
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
your
position
that
if
he
--
if
you're
right,
if
we
think
you're
right
on
intervention,
and
hold
your
right
on
intervention,
we
should
remand
without
reaching
the
other
--
any
other
question
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
whether
the
administrative
summonses
can
be
used
when
there's
a
criminal
prosecution
in
the
background?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
is
it
your
suggestion
that
if
united
states
is
investigating
a
criminal
case
and
it
goes
to
some
third
parties
who
had
some
documents
that
belonged
to
them,
but
the
documents
are
irrelevant
to
their
investigation
that
have
--
they
shouldn?t
be
able
to
take
those
that
--
those
third
party
should
not
be
permitted
to
voluntarily
to
hand
over
those
documents
to
the
united
states
unless
you
have
some
opportunity
to
litigate
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
if
the
third
parties
had
simply
said,
if
you
want
these
papers,
we?ll
give
them
to
you.
you
wouldn?t
claim
you
would
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
get
an
injunction
against
turning
the
papers
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
really
making
a
purely
statutory
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
without
any
constitutional
overtones
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
take
the
same
position
if
the
third
was
summoned
to
give
a
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
them
--
you
would
want
to
write
and
sit
there
and
make
sure
they
didn?t
ask
you
to
make
a
question
which
went
beyond
this
--
the
proper
use
of
a
--
of
7602?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
he
wanted
the
summonses
in,
i
mean,
actually
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
should
think
that
at
soon
as
a
special
agent
does
it,
you
should
be
there
to
listen
to
the
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
would
be
--
i
take
it
your
position
is,
it
wouldn?t
make
any
difference
what
they
were
investigating
for
except,
let's
assume
admittedly
they
were
pursuing
a
criminal
investigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
suggest
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
--
well,
i
know,
but
would
you
suggest
that
it
would
be
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
it?d
be
quite
alright
for
the
congress
to
arm
the
internal
revenue
service
with
a
invest
--
with
a
coercive
investigative
powers
in
criminal
tax
cases
that
may
not
be
available
in
other
kind
of
criminal
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
asked
you
--
i
know,
well,
i
mean
if
--
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they're
investigating
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
criminal
liability,
assume
that
that?s
their
only
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
quite
willing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
quite
willing
to
take
this
position
even
though
you
say,
?yes,
we
are
investigating
to
see
whether
there
is
criminal
liability
or
not,
although
we?re
also
investigating
civil
liability.?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
argue
that
if
there
was
some
objections
to
these
records
at
the
trial
that
they
should
be
overruled
if
the
only
objection
is
that
they
were
coercibly
sought
before
any
case
was
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
issue
is
that
he
--
they
aren't
entitled
to
get
the
records
at
all
by
this
mode?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn?t
satisfy
you
if
the
ruling
was
that,
yes,
they
can
get
them,
but
you
can
be
present
after
they
get
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn't
satisfy
you,
that
isn?t
your
argument
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.

what
