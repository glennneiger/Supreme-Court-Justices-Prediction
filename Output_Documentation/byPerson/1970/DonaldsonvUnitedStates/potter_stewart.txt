justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
--
the
way
to
enforce
your
position
i
suppose
would
be
to
say
that
whenever
a
7602
summonses
is
issued
and
responded
to
the
taxpayer
then
being
investigated
cannot
be
criminally
prosecuted,
that
would
be
the
sanction
to
enforce
your
position,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
