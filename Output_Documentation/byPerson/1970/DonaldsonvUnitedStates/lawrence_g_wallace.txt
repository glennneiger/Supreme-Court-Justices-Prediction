mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
case
is
here
in
the
form
of
a
denial
of
intervention
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
have
briefed
and
are
prepared
to
argue
the
issues
involved
partly
with
reference
to
general
principles
of
the
law
of
intervention.
but
the
manner
in
which
the
case
arose
suggests
that
the
substance
of
what
is
at
issue
is
no
ordinary
question
of
intervention
at
all.
this
has
been
illuminated
to
some
extent
by
questions
from
the
bench
but
i
believe
that
it
will
be
helpful
to
make
this
analytical
framework
explicit.
the
court
proceeding
in
which
the
petitioner
seeks
to
intervene
is
in
effect
one
that
he
himself
created.
there
would
have
been
no
summonses
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
indeed
no
judicial
proceeding
of
any
kind
in
which
the
petitioner
or
anyone
else
could
seek
to
intervene
had
the
petitioner
not
secured
from
the
district
court
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
the
witnesses
summoned
by
the
internal
revenue
service
from
complying
with
the
summonses
until
ordered
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
the
record
shows
they
were
willing
to
comply
with
the
summonses
and
but
for
that
preliminary
injunction,
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
for
an
enforcement
proceeding.
so
the
petitioner
in
one
important
sense
understates
the
case
when
he
contends
that
he
is
the
real
party
in
interest
in
the
enforcement
proceeding.
there
is
simply
is
no
issue
in
that
proceeding
other
than
the
question
whether
the
petitioner
will
be
permitted
to
intervene.
and
if
so,
whatever
issues,
he
will
be
allowed
to
raise.
in
other
words,
the
case
in
substance
involves
nothing
but
an
attempt
by
the
petitioner
to
secure
judicial
interference
with
the
conducting
of
an
internal
revenue
service
investigation,
an
investigation
relating
to
his
tax
liabilities,
but
directed
in
this
instance
only
to
third
persons
and
to
records
that
are
not
his
and
that
do
not
embody
any
confidential
communication,
whose
disclosure
he
claims,
he
is
legally
privileged
to
prevent.
on
this
view
of
the
case,
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
the
petitioner
stands
on
any
different
footing
from
that
of
any
other
person
who
wishes
to
prevent
or
interfere
with
an
investigation
of
third
persons
by
government
officials
because
he
fears
that
the
investigation
may
eventuate
in
the
bringing
of
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
an
issue
if
indeed
there
are
parties
who
have
raised
it
here
that
the
--
the
first
issue
is
whether
there's
any
right
and
the
petitioner
intervene
to
raise
this
--
the
7602
issue.
that
that
is
the
statutory
issue
under
7602
that
i
believe
you
would
have
posed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it?s
really
a
question
of
whether
?
and
this
is
in
effect
a
form
of
his
trying
to
enjoin
the
use
of
the
summonses
here.
it
comes
to
us
in
the
form
of
an
intervention,
but
in
effect
the
proceeding
was
began
by
his
application
for
the
restraining
order.
there
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
contention
that
he
is
trying
to
make
here,
that
it
is
not
available
in
the
investigatory
stage
and
we
answered
that
both
in
our
brief
and
i
propose
answer
it
in
the
argument,
but
i
think
first,
there
is
this
preliminary
question
whether
he
has
any
right
to
raise
it
at
all
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
in
his
effort
to
enjoin
pro
tanto
the
investigation
by
preventing
this
particular
summonses
from
being
enforced.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
the
question
of
whether
the
fruits
can
be
introduced
against
him
if
and
when
a
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
is
ever
brought
against
him.
no
such
proceeding
has
ever
been
brought
that
this
is
an
anticipatory
suit
on
his
part.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
thought
a
hearing
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
in
the
summonses
proceeding
itself?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
the
witness
is
summoned
to
bring
with
him
records
to
be
produced
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here
and
also
he
sometimes
is
asked
questions,
usually
questions
concerning
those
records.
the
witness
is
usually
a
bank
or
an
employer
or
a
corporate
official
who
will
have
records
bearing
on
the
possible
tax
liability
of
a
third
person
when
the
witness
isn?t
the
taxpayer
himself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
authority
is
in
section
7602,
if
there's
a
question
of
statutory
authority.
it
is
not
very
different
from
the
authority
of
a
police
officer
who
just
goes
into
a
business
office
and
questions
someone
to
get
information
to
see
whether
there
may
be
a
violation
of
law
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
the
summonses,
it?s
a
form
of
subpoena.
that
is
a
form
administrative
subpoena
very
similar
to
what
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
issues
and
the
federal
trade
commission
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
not
only
his
complaint
but
the
summonses
itself
says
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
get
information
relating
to
his
tax
liability.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
asked
to
intervene
but
in
a
judicial
proceeding
that
he
has
brought
in
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
has
brought
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
hasn?t
--
he
never
asked
to
intervene
in
an
administrative
proceeding.
he
asked
that
the
records
not
be
produced.
he
asked
to
interfere
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
didn?t
asked
to
be
present
to
question
the
witness.
he
asked
that
the
witness
be
restrained
from
attending
it
at
all.
he
said
that
the
whole
thing
is
improper
and
can?t
be
had.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he
didn?t.
that
is
not
his
request.
he
is
not
trying
to
intervene
in
an
administrative
proceeding.
he
is
trying
to
prevent
the
summonses
at
all.
he
says
that
it
can?t
be
issued,
there
can?t
be
any
inquiry.
that
is
his
contention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
ground
that
its
unauthorized
for
the
internal
revenue
service
to
inquire
about
someone?s
income,
if
the
inquiry
may
lead
to
criminal
proceedings
later
on
if
they
find
out
that
he
is
fraudulently
understated
his
tax.
that
is
his
contention.
now,
the
courts
have
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
upheld
the
denial
of
intervention
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
lack
of
standing
but
he
did
say
that
the
standing
question
to
some
extent
implicates
whether
what
alleged
in
the
motion
to
intervene
would
be
any
ground
for
refusing
to
enforce
the
summonses.
he
looked
to
see
what
interest
was
being
alleged
in
deciding
whether
there
was
standing.
it
is
a
form
of
a
standing
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
its
just
a
subpoena
that
he
wanted
someone
to
produce
records
so
he
could
examine
them
and
that?s
done
by
having
the
man
bring
the
records
to
him
and
if
he
sees
something
there
that
he
thinks
is
of
importance,
the
internal
revenue
service
reproduces
the
record,
makes
a
copy
of
it
and
then
gives
them
back
to
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
the
statute
doesn?t
specify
that
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that?s
not
at
issue
here.
we?re
not
resisting
any
effort
of
the
taxpayer
to
attend
the
hearing.
in
fact,
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
just
said
he
didn?t
want
to
attend
the
hearing.
just
before
lunch,
he
said
that
he
had
to
rely
on
the
good
faith
of
the
government.
so
that?s
not
at
issue
here.
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
is
whether
the
--
he
can
prevent
the
government
from
subpoenaing
the
records
at
all.
that?s
his
claim
that
the
government
has
no
right
to
subpoena
the
records
at
all.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
anticipatory
challenge
by
someone
not
yet
directly
affected
by
an
investigation
that
the
courts
have
generally
refused
to
entertain
with
regard
to
any
kind
of
official
investigation.
the
general
rule
in
our
view
and
we
recognize
that
there
are
exceptions
to
it,
but
the
general
rule
whether
articulated
in
terms
of
standing
or
of
ripeness
or
of
adequate
remedy
at
law
has
been
that
such
challenges
should
be
made
in
the
form
of
a
motion
to
suppress
or
in
other
proper
objection
to
the
use
of
the
fruits
of
the
investigation
when
and
if
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
are
actually
brought
against
the
complainant.
and
one
consideration
underlying
this
general
is
the
prejudice
to
the
public
interest
that
would
result
from
unwarranted
interruptions
and
postponements
of
official
investigations.
to
cite
only
one
example,
statutes
of
limitations
would
continue
to
run
while
possibly
protracted
litigation
might
take
place
concerning
the
manner
in
which
the
officials
were
attempting
to
conduct
their
investigation.
and
this
general
rule
is
also
intended
to
protect
the
courts
against
unnecessary
impositions
on
their
time
by
the
bringing
of
anticipatory
and
piecemeal
litigation
by
persons
who
may
never
be
harmed
and
who
will
have
adequate
opportunities
to
assert
their
claims
if
and
when
they
are
directly
affected.
and
indeed
judicial
economy
is
also
a
significant
consideration
in
the
law
of
intervention
itself.
for
example,
on
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief,
there
is
a
quotation
from
a
recent
thoughtful
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
subject
of
intervention.
in
smuck
against
hobson,
and
with
the
court?s
permission
i?d
like
to
read
the
first
sentence
of
that
quotation
which
says,
?the
decision
whether
intervention
of
right
is
warranted
does
involve
an
accommodation
between
two
potentially
conflicting
goals
to
achieve
judicial
economies
of
scale
by
resolving
related
issues
in
a
single
lawsuit
and
to
prevent
the
single
lawsuit
from
becoming
fruitlessly
complex
or
unending.
but
in
the
present
case,
both
of
these
considerations
are
on
the
same
side
of
the
balance
and
the
side
opposing
intervention.
instead
of
seeking
to
consolidated
lawsuits,
the
petitioner
here
is
attempting
to
proliferate
them,
not
only
by
inducing
the
present
summonses
enforcement
proceeding,
but
also
as
we
show
in
our
brief
in
footnote
8
on
page
23,
by
inducing
similar
proceedings
in
the
district
courts
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
and
the
southern
district
of
illinois
in
which
the
same
issues
were
raised
in
an
attempt
to
intervene
against
subpoenas
of
other
witnesses
who
have
records
bearing
on
mr.
donaldson?s
tax
liabilities.
if
there
are
counterbalancing
considerations
favoring
intervention
or
favoring
standing
which
may
be
the
more
accurate
way
to
put
it,
they
must
inhere
and
whatever
interest
of
his
that
the
petitioner
claims
would
be
adversely
affected
by
compliance
with
the
subpoenas.
and
we
believe
therefore
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
analyzed
this
case
as
turning
on
the
nature
of
the
interests
the
petitioner
is
asserting
and
how
those
interests
would
be
affected
by
compliance
with
the
subpoenas
and
we
contend
that
the
court
correctly
concluded
that
the
interests
asserted
are
not
sufficient
to
bring
the
petitioner
within
any
proper
exception
to
the
general
rule
against
interference
with
investigations
of
third
persons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
that
is
improper
and
if
the
fruits
of
that
are
ever
sought
to
be
used
against
him,
that?s
the
time
when
he
maybe
permitted
to
raise
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
fewer
than
half
of
these
investigations
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
our
suggestion
is
quite
the
contrary
that
it?s
an
investigation
into
whether
there
has
been
fraudulent
understatement
of
taxes
which
involves
both
civil
and
criminal
implications.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
not
in
the
criminal
case.
there's
no
pending
criminal
case.
it's
just
an
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
unusual.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
well
as
whether
or
not
there's
a
civil
liability
or
possibly
no
liability
at
all.
it?s
the
same
thing
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
investigates
with
their
subpoenas,
this
is
not
unusual.
it's
--
there's
federal
trade
commission
subpoenas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
nature
of
investigation.
you
see
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
that
is
the
duty
of
the
internal
revenue
agent
to
conduct
the
investigation,
see
what
the
investigation
discloses
and
whether
he
should
recommend
a
criminal
prosecution
or
that
a
civil
penalty
be
assessed
or
that
no
action
be
taken.
or
possibly
both
the
criminal
prosecution
and
the
civil
assessment
and
then
his
recommendations
are
reviewed
and
sometimes
overruled.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
each
--
i
agree
with
that
contention.
it
should
be
overruled
if
that
is
the
only
basis
for
the
objection,
but
i
also
say
that
that
is
the
kind
of
objection
that
only
someone
with
an
interest
of
the
rec
--
in
the
record
should
have
the
standing
to
make
at
that
stage
in
the
first
place,
at
the
investigative
stage
in
the
first
place.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
or
a
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
kind
of
interest
that
was
involved
in
reisman
against
caplin.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
an
interest
in
the
records
themselves,
yes,
a
proprietary
or
privileged
interest
in
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
very
frequently
the
case.
in
fact,
very
often,
the
bank
will
supply
such
information
upon
informal
request
and
if
a
summonses
is
issued
at
all,
it
is
more
or
less
simultaneously
issued
to
be
put
in
the
files
against
the
possibility
of
a
future
complaint
that
the
bank
needlessly
turning
over
their
--
the
records
to
a
government
investigator.
this
is
the
method
in
which
these
investigations
are
made
and
it
has
been
for
a
very
long
time.
we?ve
traced
the
genesis
of
section
7602
in
our
brief
and
it
has
always
been
used
in
this
manner
and
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested
from
the
bench,
this
use
has
never
been
questioned
until
very
recently.
there
were
no
cases
under
the
1939
code
when
the
provisions
explicitly
said
that
the
summonses
could
be
used
for
fraud
investigations.
we
show
that
this
has
been
consolidated
now
into
one
provision
and
it
means
the
same
thing,
but
there
were
no
cases
at
all
challenging
this
on
the
basis
of
a
criminal
purpose
argument.
the
only
issue
that
ever
arose
was
the
issue
that
this
court
settled
in
the
powell
case,
that
there
need
not
be
a
showing
of
probable
cause
in
order
to
obtain
enforcement,
but
no
one
ever
claimed
that
because
of
the
possibility
of
criminal
liability,
this
process
couldn?t
be
used
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
a
useful
reference.
i
don?t
think
that
the
issue
would
be
essentially
different
if
we
happen
to
be
in
a
case
in
which
the
witness
himself
had
interposed
an
objection
and
an
enforcement
proceeding
had
been
brought
and
then
the
petitioner
without
having
induced
that
proceeding
tried
to
intervene
in
that
proceeding,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
way
this
case
arose
highlights
what's
really
involved
here
and
that
the
operative
consideration
is
the
stage
of
the
proceedings
at
which
he
is
trying
to
assert
his
interest
and
the
kind
of
interest
he
is
trying
to
assert.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
why
rule
81
says
that
the
rules
are
applicable
in
these
proceedings
to
enforce
a
subpoena
only
insofar
as
in
the
discretion
the
district
court
thinks
the
rule
is
a
proper
guideline
in
the
case.
we
argue
in
terms
of
the
rule,
but
the
case
is
not
really
a
conventional
intervention
case
and
i
don?t
think
it?s
a
case
about
the
law
of
intervention
as
such.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he?s
application
was
to
intervene
in
the
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
that?s
his
application
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
intervene
in
the
enforcement
proceeding
and
asked
the
judge
not
to
enforce
the
summonses,
not
to
let
there
be
a
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he,
i
mean
he
first
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
telling
the
witness
that
he
couldn?t
comply
with
the
subpoena
until
ordered
by
a
court
to
do
so.
and
then,
the
summonses
enforcement
proceeding
was
brought
and
that?s
what
he
wanted
to
intervene
in
to
prevent
the
court
from
ordering
the
witness
to
comply
with
the
summonses.
his
whole
contention
is
to
try
to
get
the
witness
not
to
comply
with
the
summonses,
that
there
cannot
be
any
summonses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
that
is
not
what
he
asserted.
he
said
before
lunch
that
he
did
not
wanted
to
attend
the
administrative
hearing
as
such,
but
that
he?s
never
made
that
claim,
mr.
justice
black.
he?s
claiming
only
that
its
improper
to
have
a
summonses
of
this
kind
of
a
witness
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
frankly
don?t
know
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
because
it
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
and
i
--
i?ve
never
had
any
occasion
to
look
into
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that?s
not
the
way
we
understand
the
case.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
that
isn?t
what
he?s
asked
to
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
no
one
has
ever
offered
an
opportunity.
no
one
has
ever
notified
of
a
summonses.
it's
only
through,
sort
of
a
haphazard
situation
that
someone
other
than
the
witness
knows
that
a
summonses
has
been
issued.
this
is
true
also
if
administrative
procedure,
subpoenas
and
the
agencies.
the
securities
in
exchange
commission
for
example
issues
a
subpoena
to
a
bank,
doesn?t
notify
anyone
else
about
it
and
if
the
bank
produces
the
records
that
are
asked
for,
that?s
that.
this
is
not
a
hearing,
all
this
is,
is
an
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
no.
the
summonses
is
nothing
but
an
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that?s
not
a
hearing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
say,
that?s
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
i
don?t
know
what
our
position
is.
i
really
--
i
don?t
feel
i
should
take
a
position
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
on
that
question.
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
me
to
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it's
essentially
the
same
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
policeman
does
everyday
when
he
questions
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
through
a
summonses,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
its
--
very
little
different,
our
law
is
that
he
is
going
to
ask
these
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
usually
these
summonses
operates
not
by
having
the
man
come
to
the
internal
revenue
man
at
all,
but
the
internal
revenue
man
goes
to
the
office
and
says,
he?d
like
to
see
these
records
and
the
custodian
of
the
records
says,
alright,
here
are
the
--
why
don?t
you
look
at
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
the
police
give
me
a
summonses
to
put
in
my
file.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
this
is
an
evidence
that
can
be
used
in
the
criminal
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
records,
--
the
records
can
be
introduced
and
he
has
a
chance
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
records
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
but
he
--
well,
he
has
a
right
to
confront
a
witness
before
his
testimony
can
be
used
against
him.
that?s
the
same
as
if
the
policeman
asked
somebody
on
the
street
something
about
him,
then
you
have
to
bring
him
into
court
and
make
him
say
it
again
then
have
him
cross-examined.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don?t
know
the
answer
to
that,
i
assume
he
is.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he
wants
to
stop
it
altogether.
he
doesn?t
want
to
be
there.
he
just
wants
to
stop
it.
he
says
it
can?t
be
done,
that?s
what
at
issue
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that?s
the
only
thing
he
--
that?s
the
claim
he
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
is
that
it
can?t
be
done.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
reason
in
kayes,
yes,
however
its
pronounced,
i
don?t
know
how
the
general
pronounces
his
name,
that
involved
an
attempt
to
get
from
the
accountant
the
working
papers
of
the
taxpayer?s
attorney.
and
in
that
situation,
there
was
a
proprietary
interest
being
asserted
by
the
attorney
and
a
claim
of
privilege
that
the
taxpayer
might
to
assert
and
in
that
situation,
the
court
said
that
the
general
method
that
was
used
by
the
petitioner
here
is
the
appropriate
way
to
assert
those
interests.
now
it
just
used
general
language,
but
i
don?t
think
that
it
forecloses
the
issue
of
whether
when
there
is
no
comparable
interest
in
the
records
being
disclosed,
there
should
be
any
kind
of
anticipatory
way
that
a
taxpayer
can
prevent
the
investigation
from
going
ahead
or
the
records
from
being
turned
over,
produced
by
a
third
person
who
was
willing
to
produce
them.
i
don?t
--
our
view
is
that
the
case
simply
did
not
itself
to
that
question
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
differed
as
to
the
implications
of
the
case.
as
to
that
question,
our
position
is
that
this
kind
of
anticipatory
cutoff
of
the
investigation
can
take
place
only
at
the
behest
of
summon
with
that
kind
of
an
interest.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
that
--
it
--
i
think
so.
i
think
that
was
the
taxpayer
and
that
was
the
would-be
intervener
that
the
court
was
referring
to.
and
there
the
court
did
keep
talking
about
how
to
assert
their
interests
and
that
was
the
kind
of
interest
involved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
it
was
much
nearer
to
it.
i
think
the
taxpayer
had
a
claim
of
privilege
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
valid
claim.
but
what
was
involved
there
according
to
the
complaint
was
that
the
working
papers
of
the
taxpayer?s
attorney
which
the
attorney
had
turned
over
to
the
accountant
and
the
accountant
was
being
asked
to
produce
them
in
the
investigation
and
the
attorney
wanted
to
enjoin
that
claiming
a
proprietary
interest
in
those
papers
and
the
court
said
that
the
attorney
could
intervene
to
assert
that
interest
in
a
summonses
enforcement
proceeding
and
that
the
taxpayer
could
intervene
to
assert
his
interest
which
would
have
been
a
privilege
interest,
an
interest
in
what
would
be
disclosed
there
other
than
an
anticipatory
interest
about
possible
future
use
that
might
be
made
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
true.
i
always
hesitate
to
say
what
may
accrue
to
someone
else?s
benefit
when
he
is
supposing
my
position,
but
it
certainly
is
true
that
in
fewer
than
half
of
the
cases
in
which
full
scale
fraud
investigations
are
made
by
special
agents,
are
criminal
prosecutions
ever
brought
and
yet
in
many
more
of
the
cases,
fraud
penalties
are
collected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe
he
would
be
under
oath,
but
i
just
--
i
am
--
frankly,
i?m
not
very
knowledgeable
about
the
proceedings
at
the
summonses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
then
perhaps
that?s
what
it
is.
i
--
i?m
sure
there?d
be
no
oath
taken
in
the
business
office
when
the
internal
revenue
agent
goes
there
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
alright,
i
would
be
happy
to
furnish
you
with
the
memorandum,
certainly
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
on
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
i
believe
that
reference
in
the
reisman
opinion
is
to
the
hearing
before
the
judge
or
before
a
magistrate
as
to
whether
--
as
--
at
the
hearing,
that?s
right,
as
to
whether
the
summonses
would
be
enforced.
i
believe
he?s
referring
to
the
summonses
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
can
be
brought
before
a
magistrate,
this
kind
of
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although
it?s
usually
brought
before
a
judge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
no
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
there
are
no
hearings
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
it?s
not
an
administrative
agency;
it?s
a
part
of
the
executive.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
case
is
here
in
the
form
of
a
denial
of
intervention
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
have
briefed
and
are
prepared
to
argue
the
issues
involved
partly
with
reference
to
general
principles
of
the
law
of
intervention.
but
the
manner
in
which
the
case
arose
suggests
that
the
substance
of
what
is
at
issue
is
no
ordinary
question
of
intervention
at
all.
this
has
been
illuminated
to
some
extent
by
questions
from
the
bench
but
i
believe
that
it
will
be
helpful
to
make
this
analytical
framework
explicit.
the
court
proceeding
in
which
the
petitioner
seeks
to
intervene
is
in
effect
one
that
he
himself
created.
there
would
have
been
no
summonses
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
indeed
no
judicial
proceeding
of
any
kind
in
which
the
petitioner
or
anyone
else
could
seek
to
intervene
had
the
petitioner
not
secured
from
the
district
court
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
the
witnesses
summoned
by
the
internal
revenue
service
from
complying
with
the
summonses
until
ordered
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
the
record
shows
they
were
willing
to
comply
with
the
summonses
and
but
for
that
preliminary
injunction,
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
for
an
enforcement
proceeding.
so
the
petitioner
in
one
important
sense
understates
the
case
when
he
contends
that
he
is
the
real
party
in
interest
in
the
enforcement
proceeding.
there
is
simply
is
no
issue
in
that
proceeding
other
than
the
question
whether
the
petitioner
will
be
permitted
to
intervene.
and
if
so,
whatever
issues,
he
will
be
allowed
to
raise.
in
other
words,
the
case
in
substance
involves
nothing
but
an
attempt
by
the
petitioner
to
secure
judicial
interference
with
the
conducting
of
an
internal
revenue
service
investigation,
an
investigation
relating
to
his
tax
liabilities,
but
directed
in
this
instance
only
to
third
persons
and
to
records
that
are
not
his
and
that
do
not
embody
any
confidential
communication,
whose
disclosure
he
claims,
he
is
legally
privileged
to
prevent.
on
this
view
of
the
case,
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
the
petitioner
stands
on
any
different
footing
from
that
of
any
other
person
who
wishes
to
prevent
or
interfere
with
an
investigation
of
third
persons
by
government
officials
because
he
fears
that
the
investigation
may
eventuate
in
the
bringing
of
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
an
issue
if
indeed
there
are
parties
who
have
raised
it
here
that
the
--
the
first
issue
is
whether
there's
any
right
and
the
petitioner
intervene
to
raise
this
--
the
7602
issue.
that
that
is
the
statutory
issue
under
7602
that
i
believe
you
would
have
posed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it?s
really
a
question
of
whether
?
and
this
is
in
effect
a
form
of
his
trying
to
enjoin
the
use
of
the
summonses
here.
it
comes
to
us
in
the
form
of
an
intervention,
but
in
effect
the
proceeding
was
began
by
his
application
for
the
restraining
order.
there
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
contention
that
he
is
trying
to
make
here,
that
it
is
not
available
in
the
investigatory
stage
and
we
answered
that
both
in
our
brief
and
i
propose
answer
it
in
the
argument,
but
i
think
first,
there
is
this
preliminary
question
whether
he
has
any
right
to
raise
it
at
all
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
in
his
effort
to
enjoin
pro
tanto
the
investigation
by
preventing
this
particular
summonses
from
being
enforced.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
the
question
of
whether
the
fruits
can
be
introduced
against
him
if
and
when
a
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
is
ever
brought
against
him.
no
such
proceeding
has
ever
been
brought
that
this
is
an
anticipatory
suit
on
his
part.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
thought
a
hearing
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
in
the
summonses
proceeding
itself?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
the
witness
is
summoned
to
bring
with
him
records
to
be
produced
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here
and
also
he
sometimes
is
asked
questions,
usually
questions
concerning
those
records.
the
witness
is
usually
a
bank
or
an
employer
or
a
corporate
official
who
will
have
records
bearing
on
the
possible
tax
liability
of
a
third
person
when
the
witness
isn?t
the
taxpayer
himself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
authority
is
in
section
7602,
if
there's
a
question
of
statutory
authority.
it
is
not
very
different
from
the
authority
of
a
police
officer
who
just
goes
into
a
business
office
and
questions
someone
to
get
information
to
see
whether
there
may
be
a
violation
of
law
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
the
summonses,
it?s
a
form
of
subpoena.
that
is
a
form
administrative
subpoena
very
similar
to
what
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
issues
and
the
federal
trade
commission
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
not
only
his
complaint
but
the
summonses
itself
says
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
get
information
relating
to
his
tax
liability.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
asked
to
intervene
but
in
a
judicial
proceeding
that
he
has
brought
in
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
has
brought
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
hasn?t
--
he
never
asked
to
intervene
in
an
administrative
proceeding.
he
asked
that
the
records
not
be
produced.
he
asked
to
interfere
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
didn?t
asked
to
be
present
to
question
the
witness.
he
asked
that
the
witness
be
restrained
from
attending
it
at
all.
he
said
that
the
whole
thing
is
improper
and
can?t
be
had.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he
didn?t.
that
is
not
his
request.
he
is
not
trying
to
intervene
in
an
administrative
proceeding.
he
is
trying
to
prevent
the
summonses
at
all.
he
says
that
it
can?t
be
issued,
there
can?t
be
any
inquiry.
that
is
his
contention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
ground
that
its
unauthorized
for
the
internal
revenue
service
to
inquire
about
someone?s
income,
if
the
inquiry
may
lead
to
criminal
proceedings
later
on
if
they
find
out
that
he
is
fraudulently
understated
his
tax.
that
is
his
contention.
now,
the
courts
have
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
upheld
the
denial
of
intervention
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
lack
of
standing
but
he
did
say
that
the
standing
question
to
some
extent
implicates
whether
what
alleged
in
the
motion
to
intervene
would
be
any
ground
for
refusing
to
enforce
the
summonses.
he
looked
to
see
what
interest
was
being
alleged
in
deciding
whether
there
was
standing.
it
is
a
form
of
a
standing
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
its
just
a
subpoena
that
he
wanted
someone
to
produce
records
so
he
could
examine
them
and
that?s
done
by
having
the
man
bring
the
records
to
him
and
if
he
sees
something
there
that
he
thinks
is
of
importance,
the
internal
revenue
service
reproduces
the
record,
makes
a
copy
of
it
and
then
gives
them
back
to
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
the
statute
doesn?t
specify
that
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that?s
not
at
issue
here.
we?re
not
resisting
any
effort
of
the
taxpayer
to
attend
the
hearing.
in
fact,
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
just
said
he
didn?t
want
to
attend
the
hearing.
just
before
lunch,
he
said
that
he
had
to
rely
on
the
good
faith
of
the
government.
so
that?s
not
at
issue
here.
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
is
whether
the
--
he
can
prevent
the
government
from
subpoenaing
the
records
at
all.
that?s
his
claim
that
the
government
has
no
right
to
subpoena
the
records
at
all.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
anticipatory
challenge
by
someone
not
yet
directly
affected
by
an
investigation
that
the
courts
have
generally
refused
to
entertain
with
regard
to
any
kind
of
official
investigation.
the
general
rule
in
our
view
and
we
recognize
that
there
are
exceptions
to
it,
but
the
general
rule
whether
articulated
in
terms
of
standing
or
of
ripeness
or
of
adequate
remedy
at
law
has
been
that
such
challenges
should
be
made
in
the
form
of
a
motion
to
suppress
or
in
other
proper
objection
to
the
use
of
the
fruits
of
the
investigation
when
and
if
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
are
actually
brought
against
the
complainant.
and
one
consideration
underlying
this
general
is
the
prejudice
to
the
public
interest
that
would
result
from
unwarranted
interruptions
and
postponements
of
official
investigations.
to
cite
only
one
example,
statutes
of
limitations
would
continue
to
run
while
possibly
protracted
litigation
might
take
place
concerning
the
manner
in
which
the
officials
were
attempting
to
conduct
their
investigation.
and
this
general
rule
is
also
intended
to
protect
the
courts
against
unnecessary
impositions
on
their
time
by
the
bringing
of
anticipatory
and
piecemeal
litigation
by
persons
who
may
never
be
harmed
and
who
will
have
adequate
opportunities
to
assert
their
claims
if
and
when
they
are
directly
affected.
and
indeed
judicial
economy
is
also
a
significant
consideration
in
the
law
of
intervention
itself.
for
example,
on
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief,
there
is
a
quotation
from
a
recent
thoughtful
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
subject
of
intervention.
in
smuck
against
hobson,
and
with
the
court?s
permission
i?d
like
to
read
the
first
sentence
of
that
quotation
which
says,
?the
decision
whether
intervention
of
right
is
warranted
does
involve
an
accommodation
between
two
potentially
conflicting
goals
to
achieve
judicial
economies
of
scale
by
resolving
related
issues
in
a
single
lawsuit
and
to
prevent
the
single
lawsuit
from
becoming
fruitlessly
complex
or
unending.
but
in
the
present
case,
both
of
these
considerations
are
on
the
same
side
of
the
balance
and
the
side
opposing
intervention.
instead
of
seeking
to
consolidated
lawsuits,
the
petitioner
here
is
attempting
to
proliferate
them,
not
only
by
inducing
the
present
summonses
enforcement
proceeding,
but
also
as
we
show
in
our
brief
in
footnote
8
on
page
23,
by
inducing
similar
proceedings
in
the
district
courts
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
and
the
southern
district
of
illinois
in
which
the
same
issues
were
raised
in
an
attempt
to
intervene
against
subpoenas
of
other
witnesses
who
have
records
bearing
on
mr.
donaldson?s
tax
liabilities.
if
there
are
counterbalancing
considerations
favoring
intervention
or
favoring
standing
which
may
be
the
more
accurate
way
to
put
it,
they
must
inhere
and
whatever
interest
of
his
that
the
petitioner
claims
would
be
adversely
affected
by
compliance
with
the
subpoenas.
and
we
believe
therefore
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
analyzed
this
case
as
turning
on
the
nature
of
the
interests
the
petitioner
is
asserting
and
how
those
interests
would
be
affected
by
compliance
with
the
subpoenas
and
we
contend
that
the
court
correctly
concluded
that
the
interests
asserted
are
not
sufficient
to
bring
the
petitioner
within
any
proper
exception
to
the
general
rule
against
interference
with
investigations
of
third
persons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
that
is
improper
and
if
the
fruits
of
that
are
ever
sought
to
be
used
against
him,
that?s
the
time
when
he
maybe
permitted
to
raise
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
fewer
than
half
of
these
investigations
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
our
suggestion
is
quite
the
contrary
that
it?s
an
investigation
into
whether
there
has
been
fraudulent
understatement
of
taxes
which
involves
both
civil
and
criminal
implications.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
not
in
the
criminal
case.
there's
no
pending
criminal
case.
it's
just
an
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
unusual.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
well
as
whether
or
not
there's
a
civil
liability
or
possibly
no
liability
at
all.
it?s
the
same
thing
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
investigates
with
their
subpoenas,
this
is
not
unusual.
it's
--
there's
federal
trade
commission
subpoenas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
nature
of
investigation.
you
see
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
that
is
the
duty
of
the
internal
revenue
agent
to
conduct
the
investigation,
see
what
the
investigation
discloses
and
whether
he
should
recommend
a
criminal
prosecution
or
that
a
civil
penalty
be
assessed
or
that
no
action
be
taken.
or
possibly
both
the
criminal
prosecution
and
the
civil
assessment
and
then
his
recommendations
are
reviewed
and
sometimes
overruled.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
each
--
i
agree
with
that
contention.
it
should
be
overruled
if
that
is
the
only
basis
for
the
objection,
but
i
also
say
that
that
is
the
kind
of
objection
that
only
someone
with
an
interest
of
the
rec
--
in
the
record
should
have
the
standing
to
make
at
that
stage
in
the
first
place,
at
the
investigative
stage
in
the
first
place.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
or
a
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
kind
of
interest
that
was
involved
in
reisman
against
caplin.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
an
interest
in
the
records
themselves,
yes,
a
proprietary
or
privileged
interest
in
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
very
frequently
the
case.
in
fact,
very
often,
the
bank
will
supply
such
information
upon
informal
request
and
if
a
summonses
is
issued
at
all,
it
is
more
or
less
simultaneously
issued
to
be
put
in
the
files
against
the
possibility
of
a
future
complaint
that
the
bank
needlessly
turning
over
their
--
the
records
to
a
government
investigator.
this
is
the
method
in
which
these
investigations
are
made
and
it
has
been
for
a
very
long
time.
we?ve
traced
the
genesis
of
section
7602
in
our
brief
and
it
has
always
been
used
in
this
manner
and
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested
from
the
bench,
this
use
has
never
been
questioned
until
very
recently.
there
were
no
cases
under
the
1939
code
when
the
provisions
explicitly
said
that
the
summonses
could
be
used
for
fraud
investigations.
we
show
that
this
has
been
consolidated
now
into
one
provision
and
it
means
the
same
thing,
but
there
were
no
cases
at
all
challenging
this
on
the
basis
of
a
criminal
purpose
argument.
the
only
issue
that
ever
arose
was
the
issue
that
this
court
settled
in
the
powell
case,
that
there
need
not
be
a
showing
of
probable
cause
in
order
to
obtain
enforcement,
but
no
one
ever
claimed
that
because
of
the
possibility
of
criminal
liability,
this
process
couldn?t
be
used
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
a
useful
reference.
i
don?t
think
that
the
issue
would
be
essentially
different
if
we
happen
to
be
in
a
case
in
which
the
witness
himself
had
interposed
an
objection
and
an
enforcement
proceeding
had
been
brought
and
then
the
petitioner
without
having
induced
that
proceeding
tried
to
intervene
in
that
proceeding,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
way
this
case
arose
highlights
what's
really
involved
here
and
that
the
operative
consideration
is
the
stage
of
the
proceedings
at
which
he
is
trying
to
assert
his
interest
and
the
kind
of
interest
he
is
trying
to
assert.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
why
rule
81
says
that
the
rules
are
applicable
in
these
proceedings
to
enforce
a
subpoena
only
insofar
as
in
the
discretion
the
district
court
thinks
the
rule
is
a
proper
guideline
in
the
case.
we
argue
in
terms
of
the
rule,
but
the
case
is
not
really
a
conventional
intervention
case
and
i
don?t
think
it?s
a
case
about
the
law
of
intervention
as
such.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he?s
application
was
to
intervene
in
the
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
that?s
his
application
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
intervene
in
the
enforcement
proceeding
and
asked
the
judge
not
to
enforce
the
summonses,
not
to
let
there
be
a
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he,
i
mean
he
first
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
telling
the
witness
that
he
couldn?t
comply
with
the
subpoena
until
ordered
by
a
court
to
do
so.
and
then,
the
summonses
enforcement
proceeding
was
brought
and
that?s
what
he
wanted
to
intervene
in
to
prevent
the
court
from
ordering
the
witness
to
comply
with
the
summonses.
his
whole
contention
is
to
try
to
get
the
witness
not
to
comply
with
the
summonses,
that
there
cannot
be
any
summonses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
that
is
not
what
he
asserted.
he
said
before
lunch
that
he
did
not
wanted
to
attend
the
administrative
hearing
as
such,
but
that
he?s
never
made
that
claim,
mr.
justice
black.
he?s
claiming
only
that
its
improper
to
have
a
summonses
of
this
kind
of
a
witness
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
frankly
don?t
know
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
because
it
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
and
i
--
i?ve
never
had
any
occasion
to
look
into
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that?s
not
the
way
we
understand
the
case.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
that
isn?t
what
he?s
asked
to
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
no
one
has
ever
offered
an
opportunity.
no
one
has
ever
notified
of
a
summonses.
it's
only
through,
sort
of
a
haphazard
situation
that
someone
other
than
the
witness
knows
that
a
summonses
has
been
issued.
this
is
true
also
if
administrative
procedure,
subpoenas
and
the
agencies.
the
securities
in
exchange
commission
for
example
issues
a
subpoena
to
a
bank,
doesn?t
notify
anyone
else
about
it
and
if
the
bank
produces
the
records
that
are
asked
for,
that?s
that.
this
is
not
a
hearing,
all
this
is,
is
an
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
no.
the
summonses
is
nothing
but
an
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that?s
not
a
hearing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
say,
that?s
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
i
don?t
know
what
our
position
is.
i
really
--
i
don?t
feel
i
should
take
a
position
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
on
that
question.
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
me
to
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it's
essentially
the
same
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
policeman
does
everyday
when
he
questions
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
through
a
summonses,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
its
--
very
little
different,
our
law
is
that
he
is
going
to
ask
these
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
usually
these
summonses
operates
not
by
having
the
man
come
to
the
internal
revenue
man
at
all,
but
the
internal
revenue
man
goes
to
the
office
and
says,
he?d
like
to
see
these
records
and
the
custodian
of
the
records
says,
alright,
here
are
the
--
why
don?t
you
look
at
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
the
police
give
me
a
summonses
to
put
in
my
file.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
this
is
an
evidence
that
can
be
used
in
the
criminal
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
records,
--
the
records
can
be
introduced
and
he
has
a
chance
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
the
records
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
but
he
--
well,
he
has
a
right
to
confront
a
witness
before
his
testimony
can
be
used
against
him.
that?s
the
same
as
if
the
policeman
asked
somebody
on
the
street
something
about
him,
then
you
have
to
bring
him
into
court
and
make
him
say
it
again
then
have
him
cross-examined.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don?t
know
the
answer
to
that,
i
assume
he
is.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he
wants
to
stop
it
altogether.
he
doesn?t
want
to
be
there.
he
just
wants
to
stop
it.
he
says
it
can?t
be
done,
that?s
what
at
issue
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that?s
the
only
thing
he
--
that?s
the
claim
he
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
is
that
it
can?t
be
done.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
reason
in
kayes,
yes,
however
its
pronounced,
i
don?t
know
how
the
general
pronounces
his
name,
that
involved
an
attempt
to
get
from
the
accountant
the
working
papers
of
the
taxpayer?s
attorney.
and
in
that
situation,
there
was
a
proprietary
interest
being
asserted
by
the
attorney
and
a
claim
of
privilege
that
the
taxpayer
might
to
assert
and
in
that
situation,
the
court
said
that
the
general
method
that
was
used
by
the
petitioner
here
is
the
appropriate
way
to
assert
those
interests.
now
it
just
used
general
language,
but
i
don?t
think
that
it
forecloses
the
issue
of
whether
when
there
is
no
comparable
interest
in
the
records
being
disclosed,
there
should
be
any
kind
of
anticipatory
way
that
a
taxpayer
can
prevent
the
investigation
from
going
ahead
or
the
records
from
being
turned
over,
produced
by
a
third
person
who
was
willing
to
produce
them.
i
don?t
--
our
view
is
that
the
case
simply
did
not
itself
to
that
question
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
differed
as
to
the
implications
of
the
case.
as
to
that
question,
our
position
is
that
this
kind
of
anticipatory
cutoff
of
the
investigation
can
take
place
only
at
the
behest
of
summon
with
that
kind
of
an
interest.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
that
--
it
--
i
think
so.
i
think
that
was
the
taxpayer
and
that
was
the
would-be
intervener
that
the
court
was
referring
to.
and
there
the
court
did
keep
talking
about
how
to
assert
their
interests
and
that
was
the
kind
of
interest
involved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
it
was
much
nearer
to
it.
i
think
the
taxpayer
had
a
claim
of
privilege
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
valid
claim.
but
what
was
involved
there
according
to
the
complaint
was
that
the
working
papers
of
the
taxpayer?s
attorney
which
the
attorney
had
turned
over
to
the
accountant
and
the
accountant
was
being
asked
to
produce
them
in
the
investigation
and
the
attorney
wanted
to
enjoin
that
claiming
a
proprietary
interest
in
those
papers
and
the
court
said
that
the
attorney
could
intervene
to
assert
that
interest
in
a
summonses
enforcement
proceeding
and
that
the
taxpayer
could
intervene
to
assert
his
interest
which
would
have
been
a
privilege
interest,
an
interest
in
what
would
be
disclosed
there
other
than
an
anticipatory
interest
about
possible
future
use
that
might
be
made
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
true.
i
always
hesitate
to
say
what
may
accrue
to
someone
else?s
benefit
when
he
is
supposing
my
position,
but
it
certainly
is
true
that
in
fewer
than
half
of
the
cases
in
which
full
scale
fraud
investigations
are
made
by
special
agents,
are
criminal
prosecutions
ever
brought
and
yet
in
many
more
of
the
cases,
fraud
penalties
are
collected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe
he
would
be
under
oath,
but
i
just
--
i
am
--
frankly,
i?m
not
very
knowledgeable
about
the
proceedings
at
the
summonses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
then
perhaps
that?s
what
it
is.
i
--
i?m
sure
there?d
be
no
oath
taken
in
the
business
office
when
the
internal
revenue
agent
goes
there
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
alright,
i
would
be
happy
to
furnish
you
with
the
memorandum,
certainly
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
on
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
i
believe
that
reference
in
the
reisman
opinion
is
to
the
hearing
before
the
judge
or
before
a
magistrate
as
to
whether
--
as
--
at
the
hearing,
that?s
right,
as
to
whether
the
summonses
would
be
enforced.
i
believe
he?s
referring
to
the
summonses
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
can
be
brought
before
a
magistrate,
this
kind
of
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although
it?s
usually
brought
before
a
judge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
no
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
there
are
no
hearings
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
it?s
not
an
administrative
agency;
it?s
a
part
of
the
executive.
