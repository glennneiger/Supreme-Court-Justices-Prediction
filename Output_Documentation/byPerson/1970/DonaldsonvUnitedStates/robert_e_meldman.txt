mr.
robert
e.
meldman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
issues
relating
to
administrative
summonses.
the
first
issue
concerns
the
right
of
intervention
in
summonses
enforcement
proceedings.
intervention
under
rule
24
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
an
intervention
under
this
court?s
1964
decision
in
reisman
versus
caplin.
the
second
issue
relates
to
the
use
of
administrative
summonses
in
criminal
investigations.
petitioner
moved
to
intervene
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
was
denied
intervention.
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
and
there
has
been
no
written
opinion
by
the
trial
court.
however,
the
court
below
when
it
considered
petitioner?s
intervention,
determined
that
intervention
should
be
governed
solely
by
this
court?s
decision
in
reisman
versus
caplin.
and
the
fifth
circuit
narrowly
construed
the
reisman
decision
to
require
that
a
proprietary
interest
or
a
privilege
relationship
be
established
by
the
proposed
intervener
before
he
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
case.
secondly,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
intervener
must
show
that
if
he
would
be
allowed
to
intervene,
he
could
successfully
defend
in
the
summonses
enforcement
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
petitioner
had
not
met
their
requirements
and
therefore
denied
intervention.
i
believe
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
basically
undisputed.
in
1968,
the
internal
revenue
service
began
conducting
an
investigation
of
mr.
donaldson
concerning
his
alleged
failure
to
file
federal
income
tax
returns.
in
connection
with
this
investigation,
special
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service
issued
administrative
summonses
to
various
third
parties
with
whom
mr.
donaldson
had
transactions.
the
respondents
in
this
action,
acme
circus
operating
company
inc.
and
its
accountant
joseph
j.
mercurio
were
such
third
party
witnesses
to
receive
summonses.
acme
and
mercurio
are
not
active
parties
in
this
appeal.
in
september
of
1968,
when
donaldson
learned
that
a
special
agent
had
inquired
at
the
acme
circus
company
and
requested
certain
information
and
certain
documents,
acme
informed
mr.
donaldson
that
they
would
comply
with
any
request
made
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
but
donaldson
believing
that
the
procedures
being
used
to
investigate
him
were
not
proper
and
sought
to
prevent
involuntary
compliance
by
the
acme
circus.
following
the
guidelines
set
down
by
this
court
in
the
reisman
case,
mr.
donaldson
petitioned
the
district
court
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
enjoining
this
third
party,
acme
circus
from
complying
with
any
request
through
summonses
by
the
internal
revenue.
the
district
court
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
the
third
parties
were
then
restrained.
about
seven
weeks
later
the
united
states
then
commenced
an
independent
action
on
petition
and
order
to
show
a
cause
to
enforce
the
administrative
summonses
that
had
been
issued
to
the
acme
circus.
the
summonses
required
that
acme
and
mercurio
furnish
information
concerning
their
financial
dealings
with
the
taxpayer.
in
the
government?s
petition,
it
alleged
that
these
summonses
issued
by
the
special
agent
were
to
obtain
information
necessary
for
a
determination
of
donaldson?s
correct
tax
liability.
donaldson
was
not
named
a
party
to
the
summonses
enforcement
action
and
therefore
moved
to
intervene
under
rule
24
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
intervention
of
right.
donaldson
alleged
that
he
had
an
interest
in
this
action
and
he
would
be
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
action
and
that
he
was
not
adequately
represented
by
the
existing
parties.
he
also
filed
proposed
answers
in
which
he
alleged
that
the
purpose
for
which
the
special
agent
had
issued
these
summonses
was
not
in
fact
determination
of
correct
tax
liability
but
rather
to
gather
evidence
for
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
donaldson
also
alleged
that
section
7602
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
statute
under
which
these
summonses
is
issued,
did
not
authorize
the
use
of
the
summonses
for
criminal
investigations.
as
we
have
mentioned,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing,
the
court
simply
denied
intervention
and
the
case
comes
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
and
we
believe
that
the
courts
below
have
erred
in
three
ways.
first,
we
believe
that
under
rule
24
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
donaldson
had
an
interest
which
was
not
adequately
represented
or
protected,
and
therefore,
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
intervene
under
rule
24
(a)
(2).
secondly,
this
court
in
its
decision
of
reisman
versus
caplin,
specifically
approved
taxpayer
intervention
in
third
party
summonses
enforcement
proceedings
in
order
to
allow
the
taxpayer
an
opportunity
to
challenge
and
improper
use
of
a
section
7602
summonses,
and
therefore,
under
the
reisman
case,
donaldson
was
also
a
proper
party
to
the
enforcement
proceedings.
finally,
section
7602,
the
section
of
internal
revenue
code
under
which
this
summonses
is
issued,
does
not
authorize
the
use
of
an
administrative
summonses
to
conduct
criminal
investigations
and
therefore
donaldson
would've
had
a
proper
defense
had
he
been
allowed
into
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor.
i
think
we
would.
i
believe
that
to
determine
the
merits
of
a
defense
prior
to
allowing
an
individual
to
litigate
his
defense
would
be
premature.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
the
way
this
case
came
up,
we
had
filed
our
petition
for
a
certiorari
on
the
intervention
question.
the
court
below,
the
fifth
circuit
had
denied
intervention
because
we
could
not
have
won
even
if
we
were
allowed
in.
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general,
both
the
defense
and
the
court
itself
has
now
raised
as
well
as
the
intervention
question.
it's
very
difficult
in
this
case
to
adequately
discuss
the
defenses
that
could've
been
raised
since
we
have
no
record,
there
is
no
evidentiary
hearing,
there?s
no
testimony
whatsoever
and
we
prepared
our
brief,
we
did
it
in
an
objective
manner.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
would
hope
that
you
would
reach
the
second
question
in
our
case.
however,
if
the
court
chose
not
to
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
practical
matter
or
possibly,
what
we?re
trying
to
say
is
true,
if
the
court
does
not
reach
the
second
issue
intervention,
maybe
meaningless
back
in
the
district
court.
however,
i
think
there
are
other
cases
pending
that
this
court
may
review
that
to
--
maybe
better
vehicles
for
decision
on
the
improper
purpose.
as
i
was
saying,
we
believe
there's
a
number
of
ways
we
can
reach
the
intervention
question.
the
first
would
be
under
rule
24
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
under
that
rule
where
an
individual
claims
an
interest
in
the
subject
matter,
disposition
of
the
action
may
as
a
practical
matter
impair
or
impede
his
ability
to
protect
that
interest.
and
the
existing
party
does
not
adequately
represented
his
interest,
he
is
to
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
a
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
now,
recently
rule
24
(a)
was
amended
so
as
to
eliminate
two
requirements
that
previously
existed.
first,
that
the
movement
be
bound
by
a
decree
in
that
action.
and
secondly,
that
he
have
either
a
legal
or
equitable
claim
in
the
property.
i
believe
under
rule
24
(a)
(2)
as
its
now
amended,
this
taxpayer
meets
the
tests
of
the
rule.
the
subject
to
the
internal
revenue
investigation
is
the
taxpayer?s
affairs,
a
matter
i
think
in
which
every
taxpayer
has
both
the
legitimate
and
substantial
interest.
this
interest
would
clearly
be
impaired
if
improper
investigative
procedures
are
utilized
to
go
about
making
an
investigation.
and
finally,
i
think
it?s
clear
even
on
the
limited
record
we
have
here
that
the
third
parties
who
were
participants
in
the
district
court
action
had
no
interest
in
defending
any
of
mr.
donaldson?s
rights
nor
challenging
the
summonses.
they
were
willing
to
comply
with
whatever
the
court
ruled,
both
in
the
district
court,
court
of
appeals
and
it
assumed
from
this
court.
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
test,
they
limit
intervention
where
a
taxpayer
has
a
proprietary
interest
or
a
privilege
relationship
in
the
summonses
material
would
be
improper.
donaldson
is
protesting
the
procedures
being
used
to
investigate
him
and
not
the
ownership
of
the
documents
that
are
sought
by
the
internal
revenue.
in
this
case,
we
really
only
have
two
interested
parties.
we
have
donaldson
on
the
one
hand
who
has
attempted
to
prevent
disclosure
of
information
through
improper
procedures.
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand,
was
trying
to
require
disclosure
of
information
under
what
they
claim
are
proper
procedures.
the
third
party
who
was
the
litigant
in
the
district
court
really
has
no
interest
in
which
side
wins.
the
second
test
i
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
your
honor,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
a
third
party
voluntarily
turning
the
papers
over.
our
objection
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
well,
your
honor,
the
way
the
request
is
made
in
internal
revenue
service
investigation
is
that
the
agent
will
make
an
oral
request
under
section
7602.
he
will
use
this
as
his
guide.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
your
honor,
i
don?t
believe
there
are
any
constitutional
claims
here.
i
think
if
you
would
have
a
situation
where
a
government
agency
would
simply
walk
in
and
ask
for
some
papers
and
the
third
party
would
voluntarily
turn
them
over,
i
don?t
think
that
we
would
have
a
situation
where
we?d
have
an
objection.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
there
are
other
means
to
get
these
records.
we?re
not
really
objecting
to
their
investigation,
but
rather
the
means
in
which
they?re
going
about
it.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor
we
did.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
it
was
a
restraining
order.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
the
request
however
again
was
made
under
the
statutory
authority.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
a
correct
statement.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
this
is
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
would
be
correct
to
the
view
of
our
case.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
we
believe
that
when
this
court
considered
this
issue
which
it
did
in
the
reisman
case
that
--
this
was
the
interpretation
that
the
courts
had
given.
if
the
court
will
recall
in
the
reisman
case,
a
special
agent
had
issued
a
summonses
to
a
taxpayer?s
accountant
for
a
work
papers
and
some
documents.
the
taxpayer?s
attorney
brought
an
injunctive
action
against
both
the
accountant
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
going
to
the
district
court
--
court
of
appeals?
level,
each
level
had
a
different
theory
for
denying
taxpayer
the
right
to
restraint.
when
it
came
before
this
court,
this
court
simply
said
that
what
they're
asking
for
is
equitable
relief.
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
therefore,
we
dismissed
the
suit
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
the
accountants.
however,
the
court
went
further
and
i
believe
that
the
court
could
have
stopped
at
that
point
had
they
not
wanted
to
examine
the
entire
procedures
under
which
summonses
are
issued
in
internal
revenue
investigations.
and
it's
our
believe
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
the
--
in
the
sixth
circuit
agree
with
us
that
upon
this
examination,
the
court
found
that
the
proper
procedure
to
be
used
would
be
for
a
taxpayer
to
intervene
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.
now,
the
court
went
on
there
and
said,
?should
you
have
a
willing
third
party
such
as
peat
marwick,
the
accountant
in
the
reisman,
obviously
the
taxpayer
wouldn?t
have
no
opportunity
to
raise
any
defenses
if
they
voluntarily
turn
the
records
over.?
so
the
court
suggested
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
a
situation
like
that,
was
to
restrain
that
third
party
and
thereby
triggering
an
enforcement
proceeding
into
which
the
taxpayer
could
then
intervene
and
have
a
--
have
an
adversary
hearing
and
this
is
a
procedure
that
we?ve
attempted
to
follow
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor
that
maybe
true,
however
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
it?ll
probably
be
so.
as
a
practical
mater
the
only
reason
than
an
accountant
or
a
bank
or
anyone
would
turn
these
records
over
to
the
internal
revenue
service
is
because
of
the
statutory
authority
that
has
been
built
up
and
the
exposure
that
it
gets
and
an
accountant
is
well
aware
of
7602
and
its
sanctions.
there
can
be
a
contempt
if
there
is
a
malicious
refusal.
this
is
the
reason
that
these
people
turn
the
records
over.
there
have
been
instances
such
as
your
honors
has
pointed
out
which
we?d
call
a
soft
summonses
where
a
special
agent
will
come
in
and
say,
?you
know,
i
have
the
authority
under
the
internal
revenue
code
to
demand
records
with
a
summonses.
now,
i
won?t
bother
with
this
piece
of
paper,
just
give
me
the
records,
i?ll
give
you
a
receipt?
and
this
is
not
an
uncommon
situation.
now,
we
don?t
believe
that
the
spirit
of
the
law
and
the
ruling
of
this
court
can
be
simply
pushed
aside
because
the
agent
doesn?t
mention
a
statute
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
this
is
what's
happening.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
well,
your
honor
i
believe
that
this
court
would
find
as
we
have
urged
them
to
do
that
section
7602
summonses
cannot
be
used
in
criminal
investigations,
that
the
matter
would
as
a
practical
sense
resolve
itself
since
the
special
agents
are
the
ones
issuing
this
summonses,
we
have
no
objection
to
a
summonses
by
a
revenue
agent
in
a
civil
audit
and
i
don?t
believe
that
there
has
ever
been
any
controversy
on
that
at
all
and
i
don?t
think
that
any
taxpayer
ever
objects
to
it.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
this
would
be
the
line.
we
base
this
on
the
fact
that
this
is
where
the
internal
revenue
service
has
separated
its
civil
and
criminal
investigations.
for
example
in
1968,
they
made
a
public
announcement
that
the
purposes
of
the
special
agent
were
to
investigate
criminal
tax
fraud.
that
henceforth
this
special
agent
must
issue
miranda
warnings
to
the
taxpayer
upon
his
contact.
thirdly,
their
internal
regulations
separate
the
functions
at
this
point
in
time.
they
say
that
all
civil
aspects
of
this
case
must
stop
when
a
special
agent
enters
the
case.
for
this
reason,
this
is
where
we
believe
that
the
line
should
be
drawn.
we
might
--
may
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
past
few
months,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
now
turned
to
using
regular
search
warrants
by
their
special
agents.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
at
page
29
in
the
green
cover,
the
regulations
that
govern
the
functions
of
the
special
agents
change.
the
case
most
prominently
cited
by
the
courts
is
boren
versus
tucker
saying
that
there
really
is
no
distinction
and
the
regulations
existing
in
1956
give
a
very
at
best
grey
area
between
their
functions.
however,
the
regulations
were
changed
in
1966
and
now
under
the
regulations,
the
special
agent
has
but
one
function,
to
investigate
criminal
cases.
he
is
not
responsible
in
any
manner
for
either
civil
penalties
or
civil
tax
or
civil
determinations
of
any
kind.
and
we
have
made
a
comparison
at
page
29
of
our
brief
of
the
two
regulations.
i
think
this
is
a
critical
difference
that
has
come
about
as
you
say
within
the
last
few
years.
i
might
also
point
out
to
the
court
in
this
connection
that
there
is
a
specific
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
sections
7608
that
authorizes
the
special
agents
to
use
a
search
warrant
and
he
need
not
go
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
find
this.
now,
we
believe
that
an
examination
of
the
history
of
section
7602
and
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
issued
makes
it
clear
that
this
was
meant
to
aid
the
internal
revenue
in
determining
correct
tax
liability,
not
to
allow
the
internal
revenue
service
to
conduct
criminal
investigations.
there
maybe
instances
during
the
pendency
of
a
criminal
case
where
a
tax
liability
may
be
unnecessary
element.
however,
we
wish
to
the
--
point
out
to
the
court
that,
for
example
in
this
case,
where
the
investigation
is
for
alleged
failure
to
file
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
civil
tax
liability
to
be
determined
and
we
don?t
feel
that
this
is
truly
the
function
that
the
special
agent
here
is
meeting.
the
second
alternative
they?ve
suggested,
by
the
solicitor
general
would
be
a
suppression.
he
said,
?this
maybe
an
adequate
remedy.
allow
the
summonses
to
be
enforced
and
then
if
and
when
there
is
a
criminal
prosecution,
the
taxpayer
could
then
bring
a
suppression
action.?
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
things
to
the
court
on
this
point.
first,
i
think
suppression
is
a
very
drastic
remedy.
by
its
very
nature
can
be
employed
only
limited
circumstances.
the
issuance
of
the
summonses
if
it?s
invalidly
issued,
i
don?t
think
it
would
be
proper
under
a
section
?
a
rule
41
(e)
motion.
if
it
was
issued
for
an
improper
purpose,
this
too
may
not
be
a
proper
41
(3)
motion
for
suppression.
secondly,
we
believe
had
this
court
believed
that
the
proper
procedure
to
be
followed
was
suppression
that
it
could've
done
away
with
the
entire
scope
of
the
reisman
opinion,
simply
denied
that
taxpayer
of
relief
and
stopped
and
said
that
any
time
a
summonses
is
issued
for
any
purpose
whatsoever,
let
the
summonses
be
complied
with
and
let
suppression
be
the
remedy.
however,
i
think
it's
a
very
impractical
test
to
use.
many
times
as
the
court
well
knows
when
you
get
to
the
suppression,
evidence
has
been
commingled
and
there's
no
way
to
marshal
one
from
the
other.
i
think
if
the
court
determines
and
sets
down
a
specific
point
in
time
when
this
summonses
can
no
longer
be
used
that
the
controversy
that?s
going
on
throughout
the
country
will
come
to
an
immediate
stop.
and
we
will
have
no
longer
a
problem
if
a
special
agent
trying
to
use
a
civil
summonses
for
the
criminal
case.
now,
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
same
thing
would
be
true.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
would
believe
whether
we
would
request
that
at
the
administrative
level,
i
don?t
know.
i
would
have
to
say
as
a
practical
matter,
we?d
have
to
go
with
the
faith
of
the
government.
the
only
determination
we
can
ever
make
is
that
when
a
special
agent
comes
in
that
they
have
now
started
a
criminal
case.
there
are
rare
instances
where
a
civil
agent
is
used
to
(inaudible)
but
i
think
is
a
very
rare
instance
and
i
think
most
taxpayers
would
take
the
position
that
if
a
revenue
agent
wanted
to
question
the
third
party,
they?d
have
no
objection
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
a
revenue
agent
wanted
to
summon
a
third
party,
i
don?t
think
the
taxpayer
would
object.
if
a
special
agent
attempted
to
do
this,
then
we
think
that
what
he?s
doing
is
in
essence
usurping
the
power
given
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
if
a
special
agent
issues
the
summonses,
the
third
party
should
not
be
complied
--
compelled
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
thank
you.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i?ll
reserve
it
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may
possibly
i
can
clarify
some
of
the
questions
that
were
left
open.
in
response
to
a
--
your
inquiry
mr.
justice
black
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individuals
are
put
under
oath.
there
--
as
a
practical
matter
two
procedures
are
followed.
when
a
summonses
is
served,
if
it
is
served
that
the
place
of
business,
an
individual
is
not
formally
sworn
under
oath
then
asked
to
give
the
records
over.
however,
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
any
information
given
to
an
officer
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
considered
to
be
the
equivalent
of
being
given
under
oath,
since
it
is
subject
to
a
perjury
charge
if
it
is
false
whether
he
be
sworn
actually
or
not
sworn.
the
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
specifically
for
perjury
charges.
the
second
type
of
practical
application
is
where
an
individual
will
be
served
with
a
summonses
and
requested
to
appear
at
the
internal
revenue
office,
in
office
there.
the
reference
to
the
hearing
officer
in
the
reisman
case
as
is
indicated
in
further
on
in
the
case
is
to
the
agent
that
issued
the
summonses.
he
in
essence
conducts
a
hearing.
i
think
as
justice
black
pointed
out,
it?s
an
informal
grand
jury
if
you
would
with
a
one
man
grand
jury
sitting
there
and
he
proceeds
to
gather
evidence
and
information.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
page
9
of
our
appendix
in
the
brown
cover,
the
summonses
reproduced
and
the
beginning
of
the
summonses
reads,
?greeting.
you
are
hereby
summoned
and
required
to
appear
before
me,
an
officer
of
internal
revenue
service,?
and
it
goes
on.
in
the
same
style
that
a
subpoena
would
be
given.
the
summonses
on
the
bottom
makes
note
of
the
fact
that
failure
to
comply
with
these
summonses
will
render
you
liable
to
proceedings
in
the
district
courts
and
on
the
backside
of
the
summonses,
it
proceeds
to
tell
you,
you
can
be
found
of
contempt
and
fined
up
to
a
thousand
dollars
and
so
on.
it?s
a
very
commanding
thing
given
to
an
individual
on
the
outside.
judge
--
chief
justice
burger
had
asked
whether
the
united
states
in
essence
is
really
saying
that,
had
something
else
been
used,
the
taxpayer
would
not
have
objected
if
the
same
information
could've
been
gotten
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
oh!
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
this
is
the
nub
of
our
case.
we
say
that
there
are
grand
jury
proceedings.
we
say
that
there
are
search
warrants.
there
are
many
remedies
available
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
what
we
are
objecting
to
is
the
use
of
this
adminaturn
--
administrative
internal
coercive
summonses
to
take
this
taxpayer
or
take
this
third
party
and
bring
him
in.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
never
denied
that.
we
are
strictly
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i
don?t
believe
so
mr.
chief
justice.
a
search
warrant
is
the
other
thing
that
can
be
used
and
the
internal
revenue
service
is
now
beginning
to
use
that.
this
is
what
all
the
other
law
enforcement
agencies
use,
is
a
search
warrant.
as
to
the
question
whether
this
is
criminal
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
mr.
justice
black,
it
is
not
in
the
record
that
came
up
here.
originally
a
letter
was
sent
to
the
agent
that
had
issued
this
summonses,
the
internal
revenue
agents.
we
had
objected
to
the
issuance
of
the
summonses
by
the
revenue
agent
and
asked
to
either
confer
ahead
of
--
have
a
hearing
with
him.
because
of
what
had
happened
in
the
past,
our
letter
read
if
we
did
not
receive
a
reply
within
20
days,
we
will
assume
that
you
have
rejected
our
request,
this
is
what
happened.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
well,
your
honor,
we
were
objecting
to
the
summonses
and
be
it
before
the
hearing
officer
or
otherwise.
if
the
hearing
officer
would
seat
in
the
position
where
he
could
make
a
determination,
whether
or
not
that
summonses
was
valid,
we
would
have
sought
a
full
hearing
there.
we
made
a
token
attempt
to
make
an
intervention
there
if
you
would.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
by
this
mode?
yes.
this
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
step
forward
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
it
isn?t.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i
may
tell
you
that.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
i
don?t
believe
so.
7602
is
to
be
used
in
investigating
civil
tax
liability
and
checking
a
man?s
income
tax
return
and
it
should
be
left
and
they
should
have
this
power
to
verify
deductions
to
see
if
proper
interest
has
been
reported
and
so
on.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
our
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
that?s
true
mr.
chief
justice,
however,
we
have
not
even
objected
to
the
summonses
in
that
case.
we?ve
only
objected
to
the
use
of
the
summonses
by
a
special
agent
after
a
referral
to
the
intelligence
division
when
he
is
making
a
full-scale
criminal
investigation.
our
objection
is
that
virtually
now,
the
only
use
of
these
summonses
and
the
government
admits
this
at
page
30
into
their
brief
is
in
criminal
cases
and
not
for
the
statutory
authority
that
they
were
originally
granted.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
if
they
continue
to
only
make
this
--
use
of
the
summonses,
yes
it
would.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor
and
there
have
been
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
i
believe
hinsky
(ph)
versus
clark
which
did
just
that.
the
district
court
enforce
the
summonses
with
the
provision
that
they
could
not
be
used
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
issues
relating
to
administrative
summonses.
the
first
issue
concerns
the
right
of
intervention
in
summonses
enforcement
proceedings.
intervention
under
rule
24
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
an
intervention
under
this
court?s
1964
decision
in
reisman
versus
caplin.
the
second
issue
relates
to
the
use
of
administrative
summonses
in
criminal
investigations.
petitioner
moved
to
intervene
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
was
denied
intervention.
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
and
there
has
been
no
written
opinion
by
the
trial
court.
however,
the
court
below
when
it
considered
petitioner?s
intervention,
determined
that
intervention
should
be
governed
solely
by
this
court?s
decision
in
reisman
versus
caplin.
and
the
fifth
circuit
narrowly
construed
the
reisman
decision
to
require
that
a
proprietary
interest
or
a
privilege
relationship
be
established
by
the
proposed
intervener
before
he
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
case.
secondly,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
intervener
must
show
that
if
he
would
be
allowed
to
intervene,
he
could
successfully
defend
in
the
summonses
enforcement
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
petitioner
had
not
met
their
requirements
and
therefore
denied
intervention.
i
believe
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
basically
undisputed.
in
1968,
the
internal
revenue
service
began
conducting
an
investigation
of
mr.
donaldson
concerning
his
alleged
failure
to
file
federal
income
tax
returns.
in
connection
with
this
investigation,
special
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service
issued
administrative
summonses
to
various
third
parties
with
whom
mr.
donaldson
had
transactions.
the
respondents
in
this
action,
acme
circus
operating
company
inc.
and
its
accountant
joseph
j.
mercurio
were
such
third
party
witnesses
to
receive
summonses.
acme
and
mercurio
are
not
active
parties
in
this
appeal.
in
september
of
1968,
when
donaldson
learned
that
a
special
agent
had
inquired
at
the
acme
circus
company
and
requested
certain
information
and
certain
documents,
acme
informed
mr.
donaldson
that
they
would
comply
with
any
request
made
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
but
donaldson
believing
that
the
procedures
being
used
to
investigate
him
were
not
proper
and
sought
to
prevent
involuntary
compliance
by
the
acme
circus.
following
the
guidelines
set
down
by
this
court
in
the
reisman
case,
mr.
donaldson
petitioned
the
district
court
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
enjoining
this
third
party,
acme
circus
from
complying
with
any
request
through
summonses
by
the
internal
revenue.
the
district
court
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
the
third
parties
were
then
restrained.
about
seven
weeks
later
the
united
states
then
commenced
an
independent
action
on
petition
and
order
to
show
a
cause
to
enforce
the
administrative
summonses
that
had
been
issued
to
the
acme
circus.
the
summonses
required
that
acme
and
mercurio
furnish
information
concerning
their
financial
dealings
with
the
taxpayer.
in
the
government?s
petition,
it
alleged
that
these
summonses
issued
by
the
special
agent
were
to
obtain
information
necessary
for
a
determination
of
donaldson?s
correct
tax
liability.
donaldson
was
not
named
a
party
to
the
summonses
enforcement
action
and
therefore
moved
to
intervene
under
rule
24
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
intervention
of
right.
donaldson
alleged
that
he
had
an
interest
in
this
action
and
he
would
be
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
action
and
that
he
was
not
adequately
represented
by
the
existing
parties.
he
also
filed
proposed
answers
in
which
he
alleged
that
the
purpose
for
which
the
special
agent
had
issued
these
summonses
was
not
in
fact
determination
of
correct
tax
liability
but
rather
to
gather
evidence
for
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
donaldson
also
alleged
that
section
7602
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
statute
under
which
these
summonses
is
issued,
did
not
authorize
the
use
of
the
summonses
for
criminal
investigations.
as
we
have
mentioned,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing,
the
court
simply
denied
intervention
and
the
case
comes
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
and
we
believe
that
the
courts
below
have
erred
in
three
ways.
first,
we
believe
that
under
rule
24
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
donaldson
had
an
interest
which
was
not
adequately
represented
or
protected,
and
therefore,
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
intervene
under
rule
24
(a)
(2).
secondly,
this
court
in
its
decision
of
reisman
versus
caplin,
specifically
approved
taxpayer
intervention
in
third
party
summonses
enforcement
proceedings
in
order
to
allow
the
taxpayer
an
opportunity
to
challenge
and
improper
use
of
a
section
7602
summonses,
and
therefore,
under
the
reisman
case,
donaldson
was
also
a
proper
party
to
the
enforcement
proceedings.
finally,
section
7602,
the
section
of
internal
revenue
code
under
which
this
summonses
is
issued,
does
not
authorize
the
use
of
an
administrative
summonses
to
conduct
criminal
investigations
and
therefore
donaldson
would've
had
a
proper
defense
had
he
been
allowed
into
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor.
i
think
we
would.
i
believe
that
to
determine
the
merits
of
a
defense
prior
to
allowing
an
individual
to
litigate
his
defense
would
be
premature.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
the
way
this
case
came
up,
we
had
filed
our
petition
for
a
certiorari
on
the
intervention
question.
the
court
below,
the
fifth
circuit
had
denied
intervention
because
we
could
not
have
won
even
if
we
were
allowed
in.
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general,
both
the
defense
and
the
court
itself
has
now
raised
as
well
as
the
intervention
question.
it's
very
difficult
in
this
case
to
adequately
discuss
the
defenses
that
could've
been
raised
since
we
have
no
record,
there
is
no
evidentiary
hearing,
there?s
no
testimony
whatsoever
and
we
prepared
our
brief,
we
did
it
in
an
objective
manner.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
would
hope
that
you
would
reach
the
second
question
in
our
case.
however,
if
the
court
chose
not
to
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
practical
matter
or
possibly,
what
we?re
trying
to
say
is
true,
if
the
court
does
not
reach
the
second
issue
intervention,
maybe
meaningless
back
in
the
district
court.
however,
i
think
there
are
other
cases
pending
that
this
court
may
review
that
to
--
maybe
better
vehicles
for
decision
on
the
improper
purpose.
as
i
was
saying,
we
believe
there's
a
number
of
ways
we
can
reach
the
intervention
question.
the
first
would
be
under
rule
24
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
under
that
rule
where
an
individual
claims
an
interest
in
the
subject
matter,
disposition
of
the
action
may
as
a
practical
matter
impair
or
impede
his
ability
to
protect
that
interest.
and
the
existing
party
does
not
adequately
represented
his
interest,
he
is
to
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
a
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
now,
recently
rule
24
(a)
was
amended
so
as
to
eliminate
two
requirements
that
previously
existed.
first,
that
the
movement
be
bound
by
a
decree
in
that
action.
and
secondly,
that
he
have
either
a
legal
or
equitable
claim
in
the
property.
i
believe
under
rule
24
(a)
(2)
as
its
now
amended,
this
taxpayer
meets
the
tests
of
the
rule.
the
subject
to
the
internal
revenue
investigation
is
the
taxpayer?s
affairs,
a
matter
i
think
in
which
every
taxpayer
has
both
the
legitimate
and
substantial
interest.
this
interest
would
clearly
be
impaired
if
improper
investigative
procedures
are
utilized
to
go
about
making
an
investigation.
and
finally,
i
think
it?s
clear
even
on
the
limited
record
we
have
here
that
the
third
parties
who
were
participants
in
the
district
court
action
had
no
interest
in
defending
any
of
mr.
donaldson?s
rights
nor
challenging
the
summonses.
they
were
willing
to
comply
with
whatever
the
court
ruled,
both
in
the
district
court,
court
of
appeals
and
it
assumed
from
this
court.
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
test,
they
limit
intervention
where
a
taxpayer
has
a
proprietary
interest
or
a
privilege
relationship
in
the
summonses
material
would
be
improper.
donaldson
is
protesting
the
procedures
being
used
to
investigate
him
and
not
the
ownership
of
the
documents
that
are
sought
by
the
internal
revenue.
in
this
case,
we
really
only
have
two
interested
parties.
we
have
donaldson
on
the
one
hand
who
has
attempted
to
prevent
disclosure
of
information
through
improper
procedures.
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand,
was
trying
to
require
disclosure
of
information
under
what
they
claim
are
proper
procedures.
the
third
party
who
was
the
litigant
in
the
district
court
really
has
no
interest
in
which
side
wins.
the
second
test
i
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
your
honor,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
a
third
party
voluntarily
turning
the
papers
over.
our
objection
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
well,
your
honor,
the
way
the
request
is
made
in
internal
revenue
service
investigation
is
that
the
agent
will
make
an
oral
request
under
section
7602.
he
will
use
this
as
his
guide.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
your
honor,
i
don?t
believe
there
are
any
constitutional
claims
here.
i
think
if
you
would
have
a
situation
where
a
government
agency
would
simply
walk
in
and
ask
for
some
papers
and
the
third
party
would
voluntarily
turn
them
over,
i
don?t
think
that
we
would
have
a
situation
where
we?d
have
an
objection.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
there
are
other
means
to
get
these
records.
we?re
not
really
objecting
to
their
investigation,
but
rather
the
means
in
which
they?re
going
about
it.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor
we
did.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
it
was
a
restraining
order.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
the
request
however
again
was
made
under
the
statutory
authority.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
a
correct
statement.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
this
is
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
would
be
correct
to
the
view
of
our
case.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
we
believe
that
when
this
court
considered
this
issue
which
it
did
in
the
reisman
case
that
--
this
was
the
interpretation
that
the
courts
had
given.
if
the
court
will
recall
in
the
reisman
case,
a
special
agent
had
issued
a
summonses
to
a
taxpayer?s
accountant
for
a
work
papers
and
some
documents.
the
taxpayer?s
attorney
brought
an
injunctive
action
against
both
the
accountant
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
going
to
the
district
court
--
court
of
appeals?
level,
each
level
had
a
different
theory
for
denying
taxpayer
the
right
to
restraint.
when
it
came
before
this
court,
this
court
simply
said
that
what
they're
asking
for
is
equitable
relief.
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
therefore,
we
dismissed
the
suit
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
the
accountants.
however,
the
court
went
further
and
i
believe
that
the
court
could
have
stopped
at
that
point
had
they
not
wanted
to
examine
the
entire
procedures
under
which
summonses
are
issued
in
internal
revenue
investigations.
and
it's
our
believe
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
the
--
in
the
sixth
circuit
agree
with
us
that
upon
this
examination,
the
court
found
that
the
proper
procedure
to
be
used
would
be
for
a
taxpayer
to
intervene
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.
now,
the
court
went
on
there
and
said,
?should
you
have
a
willing
third
party
such
as
peat
marwick,
the
accountant
in
the
reisman,
obviously
the
taxpayer
wouldn?t
have
no
opportunity
to
raise
any
defenses
if
they
voluntarily
turn
the
records
over.?
so
the
court
suggested
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
a
situation
like
that,
was
to
restrain
that
third
party
and
thereby
triggering
an
enforcement
proceeding
into
which
the
taxpayer
could
then
intervene
and
have
a
--
have
an
adversary
hearing
and
this
is
a
procedure
that
we?ve
attempted
to
follow
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor
that
maybe
true,
however
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
it?ll
probably
be
so.
as
a
practical
mater
the
only
reason
than
an
accountant
or
a
bank
or
anyone
would
turn
these
records
over
to
the
internal
revenue
service
is
because
of
the
statutory
authority
that
has
been
built
up
and
the
exposure
that
it
gets
and
an
accountant
is
well
aware
of
7602
and
its
sanctions.
there
can
be
a
contempt
if
there
is
a
malicious
refusal.
this
is
the
reason
that
these
people
turn
the
records
over.
there
have
been
instances
such
as
your
honors
has
pointed
out
which
we?d
call
a
soft
summonses
where
a
special
agent
will
come
in
and
say,
?you
know,
i
have
the
authority
under
the
internal
revenue
code
to
demand
records
with
a
summonses.
now,
i
won?t
bother
with
this
piece
of
paper,
just
give
me
the
records,
i?ll
give
you
a
receipt?
and
this
is
not
an
uncommon
situation.
now,
we
don?t
believe
that
the
spirit
of
the
law
and
the
ruling
of
this
court
can
be
simply
pushed
aside
because
the
agent
doesn?t
mention
a
statute
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
this
is
what's
happening.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
well,
your
honor
i
believe
that
this
court
would
find
as
we
have
urged
them
to
do
that
section
7602
summonses
cannot
be
used
in
criminal
investigations,
that
the
matter
would
as
a
practical
sense
resolve
itself
since
the
special
agents
are
the
ones
issuing
this
summonses,
we
have
no
objection
to
a
summonses
by
a
revenue
agent
in
a
civil
audit
and
i
don?t
believe
that
there
has
ever
been
any
controversy
on
that
at
all
and
i
don?t
think
that
any
taxpayer
ever
objects
to
it.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
this
would
be
the
line.
we
base
this
on
the
fact
that
this
is
where
the
internal
revenue
service
has
separated
its
civil
and
criminal
investigations.
for
example
in
1968,
they
made
a
public
announcement
that
the
purposes
of
the
special
agent
were
to
investigate
criminal
tax
fraud.
that
henceforth
this
special
agent
must
issue
miranda
warnings
to
the
taxpayer
upon
his
contact.
thirdly,
their
internal
regulations
separate
the
functions
at
this
point
in
time.
they
say
that
all
civil
aspects
of
this
case
must
stop
when
a
special
agent
enters
the
case.
for
this
reason,
this
is
where
we
believe
that
the
line
should
be
drawn.
we
might
--
may
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
past
few
months,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
now
turned
to
using
regular
search
warrants
by
their
special
agents.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
at
page
29
in
the
green
cover,
the
regulations
that
govern
the
functions
of
the
special
agents
change.
the
case
most
prominently
cited
by
the
courts
is
boren
versus
tucker
saying
that
there
really
is
no
distinction
and
the
regulations
existing
in
1956
give
a
very
at
best
grey
area
between
their
functions.
however,
the
regulations
were
changed
in
1966
and
now
under
the
regulations,
the
special
agent
has
but
one
function,
to
investigate
criminal
cases.
he
is
not
responsible
in
any
manner
for
either
civil
penalties
or
civil
tax
or
civil
determinations
of
any
kind.
and
we
have
made
a
comparison
at
page
29
of
our
brief
of
the
two
regulations.
i
think
this
is
a
critical
difference
that
has
come
about
as
you
say
within
the
last
few
years.
i
might
also
point
out
to
the
court
in
this
connection
that
there
is
a
specific
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
sections
7608
that
authorizes
the
special
agents
to
use
a
search
warrant
and
he
need
not
go
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
find
this.
now,
we
believe
that
an
examination
of
the
history
of
section
7602
and
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
issued
makes
it
clear
that
this
was
meant
to
aid
the
internal
revenue
in
determining
correct
tax
liability,
not
to
allow
the
internal
revenue
service
to
conduct
criminal
investigations.
there
maybe
instances
during
the
pendency
of
a
criminal
case
where
a
tax
liability
may
be
unnecessary
element.
however,
we
wish
to
the
--
point
out
to
the
court
that,
for
example
in
this
case,
where
the
investigation
is
for
alleged
failure
to
file
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
civil
tax
liability
to
be
determined
and
we
don?t
feel
that
this
is
truly
the
function
that
the
special
agent
here
is
meeting.
the
second
alternative
they?ve
suggested,
by
the
solicitor
general
would
be
a
suppression.
he
said,
?this
maybe
an
adequate
remedy.
allow
the
summonses
to
be
enforced
and
then
if
and
when
there
is
a
criminal
prosecution,
the
taxpayer
could
then
bring
a
suppression
action.?
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
things
to
the
court
on
this
point.
first,
i
think
suppression
is
a
very
drastic
remedy.
by
its
very
nature
can
be
employed
only
limited
circumstances.
the
issuance
of
the
summonses
if
it?s
invalidly
issued,
i
don?t
think
it
would
be
proper
under
a
section
?
a
rule
41
(e)
motion.
if
it
was
issued
for
an
improper
purpose,
this
too
may
not
be
a
proper
41
(3)
motion
for
suppression.
secondly,
we
believe
had
this
court
believed
that
the
proper
procedure
to
be
followed
was
suppression
that
it
could've
done
away
with
the
entire
scope
of
the
reisman
opinion,
simply
denied
that
taxpayer
of
relief
and
stopped
and
said
that
any
time
a
summonses
is
issued
for
any
purpose
whatsoever,
let
the
summonses
be
complied
with
and
let
suppression
be
the
remedy.
however,
i
think
it's
a
very
impractical
test
to
use.
many
times
as
the
court
well
knows
when
you
get
to
the
suppression,
evidence
has
been
commingled
and
there's
no
way
to
marshal
one
from
the
other.
i
think
if
the
court
determines
and
sets
down
a
specific
point
in
time
when
this
summonses
can
no
longer
be
used
that
the
controversy
that?s
going
on
throughout
the
country
will
come
to
an
immediate
stop.
and
we
will
have
no
longer
a
problem
if
a
special
agent
trying
to
use
a
civil
summonses
for
the
criminal
case.
now,
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
same
thing
would
be
true.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
would
believe
whether
we
would
request
that
at
the
administrative
level,
i
don?t
know.
i
would
have
to
say
as
a
practical
matter,
we?d
have
to
go
with
the
faith
of
the
government.
the
only
determination
we
can
ever
make
is
that
when
a
special
agent
comes
in
that
they
have
now
started
a
criminal
case.
there
are
rare
instances
where
a
civil
agent
is
used
to
(inaudible)
but
i
think
is
a
very
rare
instance
and
i
think
most
taxpayers
would
take
the
position
that
if
a
revenue
agent
wanted
to
question
the
third
party,
they?d
have
no
objection
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
a
revenue
agent
wanted
to
summon
a
third
party,
i
don?t
think
the
taxpayer
would
object.
if
a
special
agent
attempted
to
do
this,
then
we
think
that
what
he?s
doing
is
in
essence
usurping
the
power
given
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
if
a
special
agent
issues
the
summonses,
the
third
party
should
not
be
complied
--
compelled
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
thank
you.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i?ll
reserve
it
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may
possibly
i
can
clarify
some
of
the
questions
that
were
left
open.
in
response
to
a
--
your
inquiry
mr.
justice
black
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individuals
are
put
under
oath.
there
--
as
a
practical
matter
two
procedures
are
followed.
when
a
summonses
is
served,
if
it
is
served
that
the
place
of
business,
an
individual
is
not
formally
sworn
under
oath
then
asked
to
give
the
records
over.
however,
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
any
information
given
to
an
officer
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
considered
to
be
the
equivalent
of
being
given
under
oath,
since
it
is
subject
to
a
perjury
charge
if
it
is
false
whether
he
be
sworn
actually
or
not
sworn.
the
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
specifically
for
perjury
charges.
the
second
type
of
practical
application
is
where
an
individual
will
be
served
with
a
summonses
and
requested
to
appear
at
the
internal
revenue
office,
in
office
there.
the
reference
to
the
hearing
officer
in
the
reisman
case
as
is
indicated
in
further
on
in
the
case
is
to
the
agent
that
issued
the
summonses.
he
in
essence
conducts
a
hearing.
i
think
as
justice
black
pointed
out,
it?s
an
informal
grand
jury
if
you
would
with
a
one
man
grand
jury
sitting
there
and
he
proceeds
to
gather
evidence
and
information.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
page
9
of
our
appendix
in
the
brown
cover,
the
summonses
reproduced
and
the
beginning
of
the
summonses
reads,
?greeting.
you
are
hereby
summoned
and
required
to
appear
before
me,
an
officer
of
internal
revenue
service,?
and
it
goes
on.
in
the
same
style
that
a
subpoena
would
be
given.
the
summonses
on
the
bottom
makes
note
of
the
fact
that
failure
to
comply
with
these
summonses
will
render
you
liable
to
proceedings
in
the
district
courts
and
on
the
backside
of
the
summonses,
it
proceeds
to
tell
you,
you
can
be
found
of
contempt
and
fined
up
to
a
thousand
dollars
and
so
on.
it?s
a
very
commanding
thing
given
to
an
individual
on
the
outside.
judge
--
chief
justice
burger
had
asked
whether
the
united
states
in
essence
is
really
saying
that,
had
something
else
been
used,
the
taxpayer
would
not
have
objected
if
the
same
information
could've
been
gotten
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
oh!
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
this
is
the
nub
of
our
case.
we
say
that
there
are
grand
jury
proceedings.
we
say
that
there
are
search
warrants.
there
are
many
remedies
available
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
what
we
are
objecting
to
is
the
use
of
this
adminaturn
--
administrative
internal
coercive
summonses
to
take
this
taxpayer
or
take
this
third
party
and
bring
him
in.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
never
denied
that.
we
are
strictly
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i
don?t
believe
so
mr.
chief
justice.
a
search
warrant
is
the
other
thing
that
can
be
used
and
the
internal
revenue
service
is
now
beginning
to
use
that.
this
is
what
all
the
other
law
enforcement
agencies
use,
is
a
search
warrant.
as
to
the
question
whether
this
is
criminal
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
mr.
justice
black,
it
is
not
in
the
record
that
came
up
here.
originally
a
letter
was
sent
to
the
agent
that
had
issued
this
summonses,
the
internal
revenue
agents.
we
had
objected
to
the
issuance
of
the
summonses
by
the
revenue
agent
and
asked
to
either
confer
ahead
of
--
have
a
hearing
with
him.
because
of
what
had
happened
in
the
past,
our
letter
read
if
we
did
not
receive
a
reply
within
20
days,
we
will
assume
that
you
have
rejected
our
request,
this
is
what
happened.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
well,
your
honor,
we
were
objecting
to
the
summonses
and
be
it
before
the
hearing
officer
or
otherwise.
if
the
hearing
officer
would
seat
in
the
position
where
he
could
make
a
determination,
whether
or
not
that
summonses
was
valid,
we
would
have
sought
a
full
hearing
there.
we
made
a
token
attempt
to
make
an
intervention
there
if
you
would.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
by
this
mode?
yes.
this
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
step
forward
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
it
isn?t.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
i
may
tell
you
that.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
no,
i
don?t
believe
so.
7602
is
to
be
used
in
investigating
civil
tax
liability
and
checking
a
man?s
income
tax
return
and
it
should
be
left
and
they
should
have
this
power
to
verify
deductions
to
see
if
proper
interest
has
been
reported
and
so
on.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
our
--
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
that?s
true
mr.
chief
justice,
however,
we
have
not
even
objected
to
the
summonses
in
that
case.
we?ve
only
objected
to
the
use
of
the
summonses
by
a
special
agent
after
a
referral
to
the
intelligence
division
when
he
is
making
a
full-scale
criminal
investigation.
our
objection
is
that
virtually
now,
the
only
use
of
these
summonses
and
the
government
admits
this
at
page
30
into
their
brief
is
in
criminal
cases
and
not
for
the
statutory
authority
that
they
were
originally
granted.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
if
they
continue
to
only
make
this
--
use
of
the
summonses,
yes
it
would.
mr.
robert
e.
meldman
yes
your
honor
and
there
have
been
cases
cited
in
the
brief,
i
believe
hinsky
(ph)
versus
clark
which
did
just
that.
the
district
court
enforce
the
summonses
with
the
provision
that
they
could
not
be
used
in
a
criminal
case.
