but
if
the
third
party,
peat

for
example,
delivered
the
documents

made
them
available
on
a
simple
request,
the
taxpayer
would
be
denied
the
kind
of
protection
you're
arguing

it?
chief

peat

might
loose
a
client,
but
that
would
be
the

sanction,

chief

warren
e.

what
do
you
do
about
the
situation
that
i
set
up?
do
you
--
you
would
say
there
is
any
remedy?
chief

we?ll
take
that
up
after

if
you
want
to

your
answer.
chief

e.

do
you
want
to
continue
with
your
argument
in
chief
or
do
you
want
to
save
the
rest
for
rebuttal?
chief

e.

you
have
a
--
let?s
see
how
much,
you?ve
got
5
minutes
left.
chief

warren
e.
burger
fine,
very
well.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
the
material
is
material
which
could
be
secured
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
in
a
tax
fraud
case
or
by
other
discovery
processes,
does
that
automatically
mean
its
available
under
an
administrative
subpoena
or
summonses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
thought
you?ve
started
out
by
saying
that
intervention
is
not
the
real
issue
here
that
lurking
under
this
issue
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don?t
know
what
his
--
what
your
friend?s
position
would
be
on
it,
but
he
might
answer
the
question
i
put
to
you
by
saying
that
even
if,
even
if
this
would
be
available
upon
a
subpoena
served
after
they
were
in
trial
or
just
before
a
trial
in
a
tax
case,
that
doesn?t
mean
that
its
available
for
the
investigation
on
preparation
of
the
tax
case
against
him.
that?s
the
point
i?m
trying
to
address
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
of
course
as
a
practical
matter,
if
he
can?t
raise
it
now,
raising
it
in
any
other
occasion
as
somewhat
academic,
isn?t
it,
after
the
cat
is
on
the
bag?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
an
interest,
do
you
really
mean
a
proprietary
interest,
don?t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
privilege
or
proprietary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
a
general
interest
certainly
in
this
information,
in
a
broad
sense.
he
obviously
has
a
general
interest
in
not
letting
the
government
see
it,
but
what
you
mean
is
to
narrow
down
proprietary
or
privileged
interest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
section
7602
in
this
process
be
the
means
by
which
internal
revenue
agents
would
go
to
a
bank
and
find
out
the
total
amount
of
deposits
that
a
taxpayer
made
and
how
much
he
paid
in
interest
for
example
to
see
if
he
had
a
basis
for
his
deductions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
he
offered
an
opportunity
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
your
point
of
view
mr.
wallace,
is
this
different
in
any
way
from
the
government
agency
whether
treasury
or
fbi
or
others,
calling
on
a
person,
a
third
person,
for
example
a
gun
shop,
they
asked
the
gun
shop
to
disclose
its
records
to
see
whether
they
have
sold
a
.38
caliber
smith
&
wesson
to
a
man
who
is
under
investigation,
is
this
fundamentally
any
different
from
that
or
is
it
just
essentially
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
the
materials
sought
in
the
reisman
case
was
nearer
to
be
being
the
kind
in
which
the
taxpayer
had
a
proprietary
interest
than
in
the
present
case
or
less
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
so,
that?s
something
new
in
recent
years
because
in
former
years,
there
were
--
they
were
not,
they
were
merely
a
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
you
have
about
five
minutes
left
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
conceding
that
a
grand
jury
could
get
this
information
without
any
difficulty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
then
suggesting
as
part
of
your
total
argument
that
if
--
that
congress
has
no
power
to
get
it
in
this
way
that
that
leaves
the
enforcement
aspect
to
calling
people
before
grand
juries,
that?s
what
--
that?s
where
it
would
leave
them,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
sometimes
really
we
know
as
a
practical
matter,
that
if
the
agent
went
by
this
process
under
7602
and
found
out
that
the
deductions
that
a
taxpayer
has
been
claiming
for
interest
for
a
long
period
past,
as
a
regular
practice
had
never
been
in
fact
paid,
that
civil
inquiry
would
lead
very
likely
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
would
it
not?
