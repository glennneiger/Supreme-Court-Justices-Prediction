what
is
the
issue
to
be
decided
in
the
hearing?
you
say
there's
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i?m
not
talking
about
in
the
court.
i?m
talking
about
when
you
take
it
before
the
internal
revenue
officer,
what
is
the
issue
before
him
and
do
they
take
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
if
it
is
a
grand
jury,
he
couldn?t
hope
to
intervene
but
i
--
what
is
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
to
hold
a
secret
hearing
which
involves
another
man?s
faith
and
decline
to
let
him
om,
that
is
logical?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
here,
because
they
issued
a
summon
and
have
a
secret
hearing,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
but
did
you
give
(voice
overlap),
does
his
complaint
where
he
wants
to
intervene
so
that
he
is
an
object
of
investigation
and
that
secret
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
asked
to
intervene?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
his
judicial
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
not
to
(voice
overlap)
with
the
proceeding,
isn?t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn?t
ask
to
be
permitted
to
be
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
proceeding
is
this
at
the
moment,
internal
revenue
service,
what
--
how
would
you
designate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
does
a
statute
authorize
that
he
bring
in
the
witness
in
the
secret
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
the
government
claim,
that
they
have
the
right
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
on
his
application,
i
have
just
read,
he
seems
to
be
asking
for
more
than
that,
i
understood
you
to
say.
didn?t
he
ask
to
intervene
in
the
administrative
proceeding
where
this
witness
was
going
to
be
examined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
he
asked
the
district
court
to
protect
him
against
the
government?s
action
in
that
subpoena,
did
he
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
his
contention
in
his
complaint
was
that
he
wanted
to
intervene
in
this
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
protect
his
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
the
government?s
position
that
an
internal
revenue
collector
has
a
right
to
summon
somebody,
make
out
a
case
against
defendant
and
not
let
the
person
who
is
the
contemplated
defendant
get
into
the
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
rather
looks
to
me
like
it
is,
on
the
pleadings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don?t
know
how
you
define
a
hearing.
but
if
you
summon
a
witness
to
come
up
before
a
man
who
is
not
a
lawyer,
he
is
not
a
judge,
he
is
not
a
notary
public
ex
officio
justice
of
the
peace
and
you
summon
in
that
to
take
evidence
pointed
directly
to
some
individual,
is
it
the
government?s
position
that
he
has
no
right
to
be
there
or
knowing
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that?s
alright.
at
the
present
time,
it
looks
to
me
like
that
is
at
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
where
does
a
policeman
have
authority
to
summon
people
in
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that?s
alright,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
quite
different,
isn?t
it?
the
summoning
of
person
to
come
before
a
man
who
is
not
a
judge,
has
no
judicial
capacity
to
give
evidence
which
is
to
be
used
to
convict
a
man
of
a
crime,
that?s
the
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
be
it
can
(voice
overlap)
i
don?t
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i?m
talking
about
the
witness
who
is
summoned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can?t
quite
understand
why
you
say
it?s
the
same,
simply
meeting
the
man
on
the
street
and
asking
him
a
question.
you
summon
him
up
before
a
united
states
officer
and
ask
him
question,
does
he
put
onto
oath?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
somebody
finds
out
that
they
are
investigating
it
to
the
extent
that
they
want
to
be
there
to
protect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
maybe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
giving
us
a
memorandum
on
that,
i
understood
they
have
a
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
on
that
particular
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i
didn?t,
judge
--mr.
judge

justice
clark
said
in
the
reisman
case,
that
however
the
government
concedes
that
a
witness
or
any
interested
party
may
attack
the
summonses
before
the
hearing
officer
and
was
a
man
to
whom
who
was
required
to
appear
a
hearing
officer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that?s
right.
well,
the
hearing
officer,
not
before
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
imagine
he
knew
the
difference
between
a
judge
and
the
hearing
officer
and
he
said
before
a
hearing
officer,
they
have
them
note
it.
