against
the
third

turning
them
over?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
a
restraining
order.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
third
party
was
perfectly
willing
to
turn
them
over?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
does
ensure
even
though
it?s
a
statutory
argument,
doesn?t
your
position
go
to
the
length
of
saying
that
any
administrative
summonses
proceeding
under
these
sections,
you
have
an
automat
--
a
third
party,
the
person
whose
records
was
invest
--
who
was
a
subject
of
investigation
has
a
right
to
intervene
at
the
threshold
because
his
interest
is
not
being
protected?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
that?s
what
i
thought.
it?s
the
broad
proposition
you?re
arguing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
these
other
subsidiary
questions
as
to
the
construction
of
the
section
itself
and
the
--
are
matters
that
are
to
be
determined
after
you?ve
once
intervene?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah.
justice
john
m.
harlan
however,
but
not
yet
with
merits.
of
course
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
the
lack
of
standing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
view
of
the
rule
24,
the
intervention
doesn?t
come
to
play
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
understand
here
there's
a
summonses?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
hope
you're
?
(inaudible)
a
chance,
(inaudible)
to
give
your
views
about
the
reasonableness.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it
is
that
the
broad
language,
if
there
is
a
broad
language,
in
the
displacement,
has
to
be
read
in
context
to
what
the
particular
issue,
wasn?t
it?
