what

(inaudible)
justice

what
is
your
position
may
i
ask?
take
a
district
--
who
built
these
apartments,
it's
the
government
or
the
state?
justice
hugo

black
and
they
--
usually
they
move
in
and
let
us
suppose
you
have
one
of
those
areas
where
they
have
these
apartment,
let's
suppose,
if
by
reason
to
that
house
or
something
else,
90%
of
the
people
in
that
area,
of
that
school
building
rather,
wouldn't
have
to
be
bused
are
black.
10%
white,
are
you
objecting
to
the
fact
that
they
bused
these
people
from
that
area
into
another
area
in
order
to
make
the
blacks
and
the
whites
conform
to
a
county
of

justice

yes,
i'm
talking
about
the
those
--
are
you
objecting
to
the
ideas
that
the
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
haven't
fully
understood
your
position.
do
you
favor
all
of
the
district
court's
order,
do
you
favor
all
of
the
order
as
came
to
the
court
of
appeals,
or
do
you
favor
neither?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
any
more
than
2%
of
the
black
--
of
black
people
who
lived
in
the
area
of
that
school.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
simply
to
see
and
a
certain
percentage
as
shown
by
the
old
county
was
achieved
in
that
balance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
choose
--
what
do
you
think
has
an
order?
since
you
do
not
favor
either
of
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
view
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
what
the
board
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
i
understand
that
you
agree
that
so
far
as
disestablishment
and
so
far
as
they
have
discrimination
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
but
your
position
is
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
is
not
discrimination
forbidden
by
the
constitution
to
let
people
go
to
the
school
closest
to
them,
everything
else
being
equal.
justice

so
long
as
it
is
not
done
underground
the

justice

isn't
that
a
pretty
good
answer?
justice

black
may
i
ask
you
what
the
record
shows
with
reference
to
whether
they
are
black
people
in
that
--
white
people
live
in
that
area?
do
you

justice

black
do
you
say
he
ordered
that
there
should
be
no
all
black
school
in
that
area
where
there
were
17%
colored
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
defending
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difference
(inaudible)
so
what
is
balance,
what
do
you
mean
by
balance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
racial
balancing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
they
live
there
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
area
of
the
whole
county,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
percentage
to
be
based
on
the
respective
populations
of
white
and
colored.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thar's
because
you
think
as
i
gather,
that's
the
state
has
complete
control
of
its
school
except
so
far
as
forbidden
by
the
constitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
a
count
of
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
there's
no
absolute
rule?
by
this
you
mean,
there'll
be
no
discrimination
against
people
by
state
laws
on
account
of
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
courts
are
driven
back
to
the
rule
of
“feasibility”
are
reasonable
“issues”
(voice

well
as
to
say
whether
or
not
the
policy
is
reasonable,
which
appears
in
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
some
people
who
might
agree
to
some
of
your
argument
than
to
agree
with
that
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
other
question.
i
understood
you
to
say
something
about
this
matter.
and
i
don't
quite
to
get
but
you
go
ahead
and
i
guess
ask
you
in
a
minute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
was
because
i
think
you
gave
it
to
me
differently
and
you
have
easily
accessed
the
point
where
we
can
find
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
saying
that
remanding
the
case
in
order
that
they
might
use
the
doctrine
of
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.

i
mean
the
part
that
says
that,
remands
it
for
that
purpose.
it
might
be
very
important
to
(voice

--
justice

if
the

law
provides
it,
they
should
be
done
of

and
there,
it
should
be
done.
justice

i
wasn't
talking
about
the
test
of

there
is
a
question
in
this
case
with
reference
to
policy

i
want
to
find
out
where
that
has
been
remanded
for
the
question,
for
the
determination
of
dispute
between

in
this
case.
justice

did
they
in

coerce

intimidate
and
tell
the

that
it

to

into

a
balancing
process.
