now,
mr.
chambers
at
some
point
before
you
sit
down,
i
wonder
whether
you
could
summarize
precisely
as
you
can
the
legal
issues
that
you
think
must
be
decided
by
the
court
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
according
to
the
court's
plan
and
that
certainly
concludes
all
sorts
of
racial
assignments.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
and
you're
supporting
the
boards
plan,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
board
sat
down
and
gerrymandered
the
district
as
much
as
they
could,
paired
schools
in
order
to
achieve
some
inter-mixture
of
a
negro
and
white
students.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
just
didn't
know
as
far
as
the
district
court
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
constitutional
or
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
board
itself
has
proposed
this
kind
of
–
this
degree
of
integration
if
you
want
to
call
it
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
constitution
does
require
disestablishment,
how
do
you
go
about
disestablishment
unless
you
take
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
also
a
racial
assignment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it's
nevertheless
state
action
conditioning
which
school
you're
going
to
go
through
based
on
race.
no
white
child
is
transferred
out
of
the
school
and
negro
can't.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
you're
keeping
somebody
else
which
is
nevertheless
race
from
doing
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
90%
of
negro
school,
a
10%
white
schools.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
rule
would
say,
the
negro
may
transfer
to
any
school
where
his
race
is
in
minority.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
let
the
white
transfer
to
the
same
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
is
permissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
february
5
order
also
defined
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
state
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
reinstated
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
paragraph
six
also
says
that
pupils
of
all
grade
shall
be
assigned
in
such
a
way
that
is
nearly
is
practicable
of
various
schools
at
various
grade
levels,
have
about
the
same
proportion
of
black
and
white
students.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
argue
with
all
about
the
whether
or
not
this
order
exceeds
or
violates
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron

what
about

you
would
