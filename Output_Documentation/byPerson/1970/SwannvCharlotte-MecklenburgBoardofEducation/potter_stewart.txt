justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
define
a
racially
identifiable
school
as
to
use
your
phrase?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
system
it's
about
71%
white
and
29%
black?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
if
a
school
is
50-50,
is
that
racially
identifiable?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
school
system,
what
is
a
racially
identifiable
school?
justice
potter
stewart
and
an
excess
of
how
many
--
how
much
percentage
white?
71%
would
exactly
reflect
the
school
population
in
the
school
district,
so
i
suppose
71%
white
would
hardly
be
racially
identifiable
as
white,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
high
would
it
have
to
get
to
be
racially
identifiable?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
a
school
in
this
system
in
defining
ourselves
to
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
a
school
with
90%
or
more
white
students
would
be
racially
identifiable,
and
a
school
with
50%
or
more
negro
students
would
be
racially
identifiable?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
think
---
was
that
--
excuse
me.
was
that
the
test
of
that
phrase
used
in
the
district
court,
i
couldn't
find
really
any
further
–
bring
it
down
to
facts
or
figures
than
just
that
loose
phrase,
racially
identifiable,
that
maybe
i
missed
something.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
court's
figure
is
86
rather
than
90%.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
the
court's
figure
50%
black
(voice
overlap)
racially
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
identifiable
black
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
if
there's
any
and
i
don't
know,
i'm
asking
for
information,
is
there
any
state
in
the
united
states
that
at
one
time
another
historically
maybe
a
hundred
years
ago,
150
years
ago,
didn't
have
segregated
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
more
recent.
justice
potter
stewart
were
those
schools
located
in
that
northwest
quadrant,
that
you
pointed
out?
justice
potter
stewart
since
we've
already
interrupted
you,
may
i
--
could
you
answer
couple
of
questions
to
make
it
clear
to
me
what
--
just
what
is
and
what
is
not
in
controversy
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
mecklenburg
county
outside
the
city
school
situation
is
really
not
in
serious
controversy,
am
i
wrong
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
further
understand
that
the
big
argument
is
about
the
elementary
schools,
there
is
a
somewhat
more
limited
in
minor
argument
about
the
high
schools
involving
the
transfer
of
some
300
students
outward.
but
that
the
big
controversy
is
about
the
elementary
schools,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
right.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
analysis
on
this
previous
busing
mileage
that
you
told
us
about,
1969
and
1970
and
before,
how
much
--
what
was
out
the
county
in
connection
with
consolidated
schools
of
the
county
and
how
much
goes
in
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
that
was
public
transportation.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
talking
about
the
school
buses.
justice
potter
stewart
the
majority
of
them
was
out
in
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
they
handle
the
consolidated
--
the
typical
pattern
and
as
we
both
know
has
been
for
the
one
room
school
house,
rural
school
house,
ten
or
twelve
or
more
often
to
be
consolidated
into
a
school
and
involving
quite
apart
from
any
racial
considerations,
a
great
deal
of
the
busing
mileage.
that's
true
in
vermont
or
north
dakota
as
much
as
it
is
in
north
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
please
that
one
mr.
chambers,
that
was
the
school
board's
plan
as
of
when?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
again,
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
as
i
understand
it
involves
some,
what
one
might
call
benevolent
racial
gerrymandering,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
the
satellite
--
the
satellite
involves
one
way
busing
or
other
form
of
transportation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
one
way?
justice
potter
stewart
outwardly.
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
the
satellite
district
was
there
also
a
school
building?
justice
potter
stewart
when
there
is
a
satellite
district
and
this
really
–
i
didn't
get
the
definition
of
terms,
i
thought
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
involved
one
way
busing
to
--
outwardly
to
--
usually
outwardly
in
charlotte
to
a
school,
from
an
area
where
there
was
no
longer
a
school.
justice
potter
stewart
anymore,
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
say
in
a
few
words
what
clustering
means,
i
should
interject
maybe
that
i
think
bouvier
is
going
to
have
to
get
out
a
new
edition
of
his
dictionary,
in
at
least
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
comparing
and
clustering
in
satellites
and
these
new
terms.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
with
two-way
movement.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
clustering,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
but
usually
what
you
do
is
enlarge
your
zone
around
three
or
more
--
two
or
more
school
buildings,
isn't
that
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
then
would
be
pairing
rather
than
clustering,
if
they're
non-contiguous?
justice
potter
stewart
the
pairing
involves
by
definition
always
only
two
schools,
is
that
--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
two
way
movement?
justice
potter
stewart
and
non-contiguous?
justice
potter
stewart
they
can
be,
yeah,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
students.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
question
about
or
am
i
--
do
i
understand
there
is
no
question
about
faculty
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
single
racially
identifiable
faculty
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
is
no
issue
here
about
transfers
from
majority
to
minority,
for
anyone
who
wants
the
transfer?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
it
in
the
board's
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
it
specifically
approved
busing
with
respect
to
the
high
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
one
way
busing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
read
mcmillan's
opinion,
judge
mcmillan's
opinion
as
having
proceeded
on
the
premise
that
the
constitution
required
or
disestablishment
required
racial
balance
in
the
proportional
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
quotation
that
you've
just
read.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general
are
we
talking
here
about
as
you
seem
to
be
now
and
in
the
colloquy
with
my
brother
marshall,
about
the
substantive
right
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
confers
upon
a
public
school
student,
negro
or
white
or
are
we
talking
about
the
appropriate
remedy
for
the
disestablishment
of
a
concededly
unconstitutional
school
system,
they're
different,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
but
the
--
if
there
is
a
right
such
as
an
absolute
constitutional
right
such
as
it
was
suggested
by
my
brother
marshall
and
such
as
suggested
by
the
language
you
read
from
the
brief
in
the
other
case,
then
i
suppose
that
right
exists
everywhere
in
united
states
in
every
system
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
it's
humanly
possible
to
do
it
unless
you
have
an
all
white
school
population
or
an
all
negro
school
population
where
of
course
you
can't
have
any
schools
that
are
not
all
white
or
all
negro,
but
if
they're
to
exist,
that
substantive
constitutional
right,
that
each
individual
public
school
student
has,
that
same
one
thing,
but
if
we're
talking
about
what's
open
to
a
court
to
--
or
what
is
required
of
the
court,
to
disestablish
a
concededly
unconstitutional
system,
we're
talking
about
something
else
and
something
at
least
of
a
more
limited
perhaps,
perhaps
at
least
a
more
limited
geographic
scope,
if
it's
not
more
limited
in
other
ways,
aren't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
interrelated
but
they
are
different
also.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
our
point
is,
if
there
is
such
an
absolute
substantive
constitutional
right,
then
that
right
exists
in
chicago
or
in
north
dakota
or
cincinnati
or
detroit
as
well
as
in
charlotte?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general
do
you
suppose
there
are
many
school
districts
in
the
whole
united
states,
east
or
west,
north
or
south
that
don't
show
the
vestiges
of
prior
discrimination
at
least
when
you
include
some
of
the
elements
that
are
included
here,
such
as
the
enforcement
of
restrictive
residential
covenants
arrived
at
shelley
against
kraemer
or
the
building
of
school
buildings
by
school
boards
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
children
in
those
areas?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
there's
a
single
school
district
in
the
united
states
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
simply
prompted
by
the
--
you
suggest
that
your
argument
is
quite
limited
to
implicitly
few
situations
but
my
question
was
suggesting
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
sure
are
we
of
that,
i
mean
talking
about
a
hundred
years
ago?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
feasible.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
do
you
mean
when
you
use
the
phrase
racial
balance?
it
seems
to
have
different
content
in
the
words
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
each
school
building?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
school
district?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
what
you
--?
justice
potter
stewart
--
mean
when
you
use
that
phrase?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
against
the
background
of
the
dual
school
system
or
in
any
way?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
do
i
understand
you
then
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
white
concede
that
it
is
the
constitutional
duty
of
a
school
board
at
least
one
of
which
there
has
been
previously
or
recently
previously
been
a
dual
school
system,
it's
their
constitutional
duty
to
maximize
compulsory
integration?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
--
this
is
if
you've
done
the
first
five
things.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
come
to
students?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
now
as
i
understand
your
position
that
if
you've
done
the
first
five
things
with
respect
to
faculty
and
facilities,
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
with
transportation,
that
if
you've
done
that
then
your
constitution,
no
duty
is
satisfied
if
you
use
colorblind
neighborhood
attended
zones.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
you
correctly
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
seems
to
be
a
little
different
from
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
that
was
your
whole
challenge
in
this
case,
this
compulsory
--?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
be
on
bus
or
on
foot
or
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
philosophy,
what
you
are
challenging
is
the
district
court's
order
that
compels
this
pairing
and
clustering
in
the
satellite
zones
and
the
other
devices
to
compel
greater
integration
than
was
provided
by
the
school
board's
plan.
that
is
what
your
challenge
is,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that's
not
required
by
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
i
understand
what
you've
said,
it
is
that
the
--
your
client,
the
board
of
education
of
charlotte-mecklenburg,
in
its
plan
went
further
than
a
constitution
required
it
to
go.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
prohibited?
justice
potter
stewart
but
north
carolina
law
leaves
--
gives
a
great
deal
of
autonomy
to
the
local
school
districts
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
way
i
understood
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
well
didn't
he
say
mr.
horack,
i
don't
have
his
opinion
right
in
front
of
me
but
i've
read
it
more
than
once
recently.
didn't
he
say
that
the
touchstone
of
what
the
ideal
objective
should
be
would
be
71%
white
students,
29%
negro
students,
eight
school
building
in
the
district.
but
he
realized
that
that
optimum
objective
was
not
possible?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
said,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
but
it
can
using
the
court
of
appeal's
language,
what
can
recently
be
done
to
make
a
maximum
approach
to
that
objective.
and
that's
at
least
where
he
verbalized
what
he
did
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
not
but
at
least
--.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
ultimate
question
here
i
suppose
the
ultimate
basic
whereabouts
question
is,
whether
the
united
states
constitution
requires
an
effort,
whether
it
be
the
maximum
reasonable
effort,
or
a
maximum
feasible
effort,
or
the
stricter
test
proposed
by
the
petitioners
of
this
in
mobile
case,
the
maximum
humanly
possible
effort.
whether
or
not
the
constitution
requires
any
such
maximum
effort
towards
that
objective,
that
i've
mentioned
that
is
in
this
case
71%,
29%.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
the
ultimate
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
question,
that
is
just
--
that
is
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
may
be
then
i
have
misunderstood
it.
i
thought
the
school
board's
plan
did
have
a
benevolent
racial
bias.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
plan
in
fact
did
have
a
benign
racial
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
i
guess
is
that
this
is
not
perhaps
the
individual
constitutional
right
of
an
individual
public
school
student
but
rather
it's
the
constitutional
duty
of
every
school
board
to
operate
a
non
discriminatory
system
in
some
what
of
an
analogy
to
the
jury
cases
--
that's
the
duty
of
a
state
to
have
a
non
discriminatory
jury
system,
but
it's
not
the
right
of
any
particular
defendant
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
which
is
racially
representative
of
the
racial
make
up
of
the
community.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
constitutional
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
right
and
why
do
you
say
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
racially
non
discriminated.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
did
--
i
think
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
everything
you've
just
said
except
that
you
approved
the
court
of
appeals
rule
of
reason.
i
didn't
understand
that
you
did.
now,
not
of
course
every
--
no
man
is
going
to
say,
“i'm
against
being
reasonable”
but
then
and
i
don't
--
we're
not
talking
about
that
but
using
this
as
a
term
of
art,
because
as
i
understand,
the
rule
of
reason
is
that
--
as
explained
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
that
the
constitution
requires
maximum
racial
balancing,
consistent
with
what
is
reasonable.
and
i
didn't
think
you
did
agree
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking,
now
that
branch
of
what
you
just
said
is
talking,
is
directed
to
an
appropriate
or
at
least
permissible
exercise
of
a
district
court's
discretion,
equitable
discretion
to
correct
a
conceded
previous
constitutional
violation.
do
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
talking,
--
we've
not
been
talking
about
what
a
board's
constitutional
duty
substantively
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
proper
test
is
a
result
oriented
test
and
that
that
test
should
be
as
i
understand
it
that
there
be
no
racially
identifiable
school,
individual
schools.
however,
that
phrase
maybe
defined.
do
i
understand
it
correctly?
(voice
overlap)
very
heavy
burden
on
the
school
board
to
show
that
it's
impossible
to
eliminate
a
particular
racial
area.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
either
all
black
or
racially
identifiable.
isn't
that
even
though
not
all
black.
justice
potter
stewart
--
minority
in
that
particular
school
district.
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
if
they
are
the
majority
at
a
particular
school
district.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
the
senior
high
school
situation
in
this
particular
plan.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
define
a
racially
identifiable
school
as
to
use
your
phrase?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
system
it's
about
71%
white
and
29%
black?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
if
a
school
is
50-50,
is
that
racially
identifiable?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
school
system,
what
is
a
racially
identifiable
school?
justice
potter
stewart
and
an
excess
of
how
many
--
how
much
percentage
white?
71%
would
exactly
reflect
the
school
population
in
the
school
district,
so
i
suppose
71%
white
would
hardly
be
racially
identifiable
as
white,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
high
would
it
have
to
get
to
be
racially
identifiable?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
a
school
in
this
system
in
defining
ourselves
to
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
a
school
with
90%
or
more
white
students
would
be
racially
identifiable,
and
a
school
with
50%
or
more
negro
students
would
be
racially
identifiable?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
think
---
was
that
--
excuse
me.
was
that
the
test
of
that
phrase
used
in
the
district
court,
i
couldn't
find
really
any
further
–
bring
it
down
to
facts
or
figures
than
just
that
loose
phrase,
racially
identifiable,
that
maybe
i
missed
something.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
court's
figure
is
86
rather
than
90%.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
the
court's
figure
50%
black
(voice
overlap)
racially
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
identifiable
black
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
if
there's
any
and
i
don't
know,
i'm
asking
for
information,
is
there
any
state
in
the
united
states
that
at
one
time
another
historically
maybe
a
hundred
years
ago,
150
years
ago,
didn't
have
segregated
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
more
recent.
justice
potter
stewart
were
those
schools
located
in
that
northwest
quadrant,
that
you
pointed
out?
justice
potter
stewart
since
we've
already
interrupted
you,
may
i
--
could
you
answer
couple
of
questions
to
make
it
clear
to
me
what
--
just
what
is
and
what
is
not
in
controversy
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
mecklenburg
county
outside
the
city
school
situation
is
really
not
in
serious
controversy,
am
i
wrong
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
further
understand
that
the
big
argument
is
about
the
elementary
schools,
there
is
a
somewhat
more
limited
in
minor
argument
about
the
high
schools
involving
the
transfer
of
some
300
students
outward.
but
that
the
big
controversy
is
about
the
elementary
schools,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
right.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
analysis
on
this
previous
busing
mileage
that
you
told
us
about,
1969
and
1970
and
before,
how
much
--
what
was
out
the
county
in
connection
with
consolidated
schools
of
the
county
and
how
much
goes
in
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
that
was
public
transportation.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
talking
about
the
school
buses.
justice
potter
stewart
the
majority
of
them
was
out
in
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
they
handle
the
consolidated
--
the
typical
pattern
and
as
we
both
know
has
been
for
the
one
room
school
house,
rural
school
house,
ten
or
twelve
or
more
often
to
be
consolidated
into
a
school
and
involving
quite
apart
from
any
racial
considerations,
a
great
deal
of
the
busing
mileage.
that's
true
in
vermont
or
north
dakota
as
much
as
it
is
in
north
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
please
that
one
mr.
chambers,
that
was
the
school
board's
plan
as
of
when?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
again,
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
as
i
understand
it
involves
some,
what
one
might
call
benevolent
racial
gerrymandering,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
the
satellite
--
the
satellite
involves
one
way
busing
or
other
form
of
transportation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
one
way?
justice
potter
stewart
outwardly.
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
the
satellite
district
was
there
also
a
school
building?
justice
potter
stewart
when
there
is
a
satellite
district
and
this
really
–
i
didn't
get
the
definition
of
terms,
i
thought
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
involved
one
way
busing
to
--
outwardly
to
--
usually
outwardly
in
charlotte
to
a
school,
from
an
area
where
there
was
no
longer
a
school.
justice
potter
stewart
anymore,
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
say
in
a
few
words
what
clustering
means,
i
should
interject
maybe
that
i
think
bouvier
is
going
to
have
to
get
out
a
new
edition
of
his
dictionary,
in
at
least
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
comparing
and
clustering
in
satellites
and
these
new
terms.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
with
two-way
movement.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
clustering,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
but
usually
what
you
do
is
enlarge
your
zone
around
three
or
more
--
two
or
more
school
buildings,
isn't
that
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
then
would
be
pairing
rather
than
clustering,
if
they're
non-contiguous?
justice
potter
stewart
the
pairing
involves
by
definition
always
only
two
schools,
is
that
--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
two
way
movement?
justice
potter
stewart
and
non-contiguous?
justice
potter
stewart
they
can
be,
yeah,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
students.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
question
about
or
am
i
--
do
i
understand
there
is
no
question
about
faculty
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
single
racially
identifiable
faculty
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
is
no
issue
here
about
transfers
from
majority
to
minority,
for
anyone
who
wants
the
transfer?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
it
in
the
board's
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
it
specifically
approved
busing
with
respect
to
the
high
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
one
way
busing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
read
mcmillan's
opinion,
judge
mcmillan's
opinion
as
having
proceeded
on
the
premise
that
the
constitution
required
or
disestablishment
required
racial
balance
in
the
proportional
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
quotation
that
you've
just
read.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general
are
we
talking
here
about
as
you
seem
to
be
now
and
in
the
colloquy
with
my
brother
marshall,
about
the
substantive
right
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
confers
upon
a
public
school
student,
negro
or
white
or
are
we
talking
about
the
appropriate
remedy
for
the
disestablishment
of
a
concededly
unconstitutional
school
system,
they're
different,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
but
the
--
if
there
is
a
right
such
as
an
absolute
constitutional
right
such
as
it
was
suggested
by
my
brother
marshall
and
such
as
suggested
by
the
language
you
read
from
the
brief
in
the
other
case,
then
i
suppose
that
right
exists
everywhere
in
united
states
in
every
system
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
it's
humanly
possible
to
do
it
unless
you
have
an
all
white
school
population
or
an
all
negro
school
population
where
of
course
you
can't
have
any
schools
that
are
not
all
white
or
all
negro,
but
if
they're
to
exist,
that
substantive
constitutional
right,
that
each
individual
public
school
student
has,
that
same
one
thing,
but
if
we're
talking
about
what's
open
to
a
court
to
--
or
what
is
required
of
the
court,
to
disestablish
a
concededly
unconstitutional
system,
we're
talking
about
something
else
and
something
at
least
of
a
more
limited
perhaps,
perhaps
at
least
a
more
limited
geographic
scope,
if
it's
not
more
limited
in
other
ways,
aren't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
interrelated
but
they
are
different
also.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
our
point
is,
if
there
is
such
an
absolute
substantive
constitutional
right,
then
that
right
exists
in
chicago
or
in
north
dakota
or
cincinnati
or
detroit
as
well
as
in
charlotte?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general
do
you
suppose
there
are
many
school
districts
in
the
whole
united
states,
east
or
west,
north
or
south
that
don't
show
the
vestiges
of
prior
discrimination
at
least
when
you
include
some
of
the
elements
that
are
included
here,
such
as
the
enforcement
of
restrictive
residential
covenants
arrived
at
shelley
against
kraemer
or
the
building
of
school
buildings
by
school
boards
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
children
in
those
areas?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
there's
a
single
school
district
in
the
united
states
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
simply
prompted
by
the
--
you
suggest
that
your
argument
is
quite
limited
to
implicitly
few
situations
but
my
question
was
suggesting
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
sure
are
we
of
that,
i
mean
talking
about
a
hundred
years
ago?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
feasible.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
do
you
mean
when
you
use
the
phrase
racial
balance?
it
seems
to
have
different
content
in
the
words
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
each
school
building?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
school
district?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
what
you
--?
justice
potter
stewart
--
mean
when
you
use
that
phrase?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
against
the
background
of
the
dual
school
system
or
in
any
way?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
do
i
understand
you
then
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
white
concede
that
it
is
the
constitutional
duty
of
a
school
board
at
least
one
of
which
there
has
been
previously
or
recently
previously
been
a
dual
school
system,
it's
their
constitutional
duty
to
maximize
compulsory
integration?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
--
this
is
if
you've
done
the
first
five
things.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
come
to
students?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
now
as
i
understand
your
position
that
if
you've
done
the
first
five
things
with
respect
to
faculty
and
facilities,
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
with
transportation,
that
if
you've
done
that
then
your
constitution,
no
duty
is
satisfied
if
you
use
colorblind
neighborhood
attended
zones.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
you
correctly
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
seems
to
be
a
little
different
from
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
that
was
your
whole
challenge
in
this
case,
this
compulsory
--?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
be
on
bus
or
on
foot
or
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
philosophy,
what
you
are
challenging
is
the
district
court's
order
that
compels
this
pairing
and
clustering
in
the
satellite
zones
and
the
other
devices
to
compel
greater
integration
than
was
provided
by
the
school
board's
plan.
that
is
what
your
challenge
is,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that's
not
required
by
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
i
understand
what
you've
said,
it
is
that
the
--
your
client,
the
board
of
education
of
charlotte-mecklenburg,
in
its
plan
went
further
than
a
constitution
required
it
to
go.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
prohibited?
justice
potter
stewart
but
north
carolina
law
leaves
--
gives
a
great
deal
of
autonomy
to
the
local
school
districts
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
way
i
understood
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
well
didn't
he
say
mr.
horack,
i
don't
have
his
opinion
right
in
front
of
me
but
i've
read
it
more
than
once
recently.
didn't
he
say
that
the
touchstone
of
what
the
ideal
objective
should
be
would
be
71%
white
students,
29%
negro
students,
eight
school
building
in
the
district.
but
he
realized
that
that
optimum
objective
was
not
possible?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
said,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
but
it
can
using
the
court
of
appeal's
language,
what
can
recently
be
done
to
make
a
maximum
approach
to
that
objective.
and
that's
at
least
where
he
verbalized
what
he
did
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
not
but
at
least
--.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
ultimate
question
here
i
suppose
the
ultimate
basic
whereabouts
question
is,
whether
the
united
states
constitution
requires
an
effort,
whether
it
be
the
maximum
reasonable
effort,
or
a
maximum
feasible
effort,
or
the
stricter
test
proposed
by
the
petitioners
of
this
in
mobile
case,
the
maximum
humanly
possible
effort.
whether
or
not
the
constitution
requires
any
such
maximum
effort
towards
that
objective,
that
i've
mentioned
that
is
in
this
case
71%,
29%.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
the
ultimate
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
question,
that
is
just
--
that
is
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
may
be
then
i
have
misunderstood
it.
i
thought
the
school
board's
plan
did
have
a
benevolent
racial
bias.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
plan
in
fact
did
have
a
benign
racial
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
i
guess
is
that
this
is
not
perhaps
the
individual
constitutional
right
of
an
individual
public
school
student
but
rather
it's
the
constitutional
duty
of
every
school
board
to
operate
a
non
discriminatory
system
in
some
what
of
an
analogy
to
the
jury
cases
--
that's
the
duty
of
a
state
to
have
a
non
discriminatory
jury
system,
but
it's
not
the
right
of
any
particular
defendant
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
which
is
racially
representative
of
the
racial
make
up
of
the
community.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
constitutional
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
right
and
why
do
you
say
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
racially
non
discriminated.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
did
--
i
think
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
everything
you've
just
said
except
that
you
approved
the
court
of
appeals
rule
of
reason.
i
didn't
understand
that
you
did.
now,
not
of
course
every
--
no
man
is
going
to
say,
“i'm
against
being
reasonable”
but
then
and
i
don't
--
we're
not
talking
about
that
but
using
this
as
a
term
of
art,
because
as
i
understand,
the
rule
of
reason
is
that
--
as
explained
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
that
the
constitution
requires
maximum
racial
balancing,
consistent
with
what
is
reasonable.
and
i
didn't
think
you
did
agree
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking,
now
that
branch
of
what
you
just
said
is
talking,
is
directed
to
an
appropriate
or
at
least
permissible
exercise
of
a
district
court's
discretion,
equitable
discretion
to
correct
a
conceded
previous
constitutional
violation.
do
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
talking,
--
we've
not
been
talking
about
what
a
board's
constitutional
duty
substantively
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
proper
test
is
a
result
oriented
test
and
that
that
test
should
be
as
i
understand
it
that
there
be
