mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
a
long
road,
we've
made
substantial
progress
and
this
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
few
today
question
the
central
rightness
of
the
decision
which
was
reached
by
this
court
in
brown
against
the
board
of
education
16
years
ago.
it's
true
that
16
years
have
passed,
but
in
this
connection
that
may
be
observed
that
the
brown
case
itself
was
twice
argued
in
this
court,
and
before
the
initial
decision,
that
it
was
pending
here
for
two-and-a-half
years
before
it
was
decided.
it
was
also
here
in
additional
year
or
a
total
of
three-and-a-half
years
when
the
case
was
set
down
for
further
argument
with
respect
to
remedy.
for
many
years,
there
was
a
serious
problem
simply
in
getting
the
decision
accepted.
i
need
not
recall
little
rock
and
oxford
in
the
confrontation
at
the
university
of
alabama.
all
of
that
is
in
the
past
now,
and
fortunately
and
wisely
so.
because
of
this
situation,
the
court
has
only
recently
had
occasioned
to
consider
the
many
problems
of
detail,
which
arise
in
the
application
of
the
brown
decision.
on
the
basis
of
a
careful
survey,
i
find
that
there
are
25
school
cases
which
have
been
decided
on
the
merits
by
this
court
in
the
16
years
since
brown
was
decided.
many
of
these
are
per
curiam
decisions.
one
was
cooper
and
aaron
which
arose
out
of
the
little
rock
situation.
other
cases
involved
various
aspects
of
so-called
massive
resistance
and
interposition,
such
as
bush
against
the
orleans
parish
school
board.
then
only
six
years
ago,
in
griffin
against
prince
edward
county,
the
court
held
the
schools
could
not
be
closed
while
public
money
was
meant
to
support
private
white
only
schools.
during
these
years,
many
hundreds
of
cases
were
decided
in
lower
federal
courts
and
great
determination
and
courage
was
shown
there.
not
until
recently,
however,
has
this
court
had
occasioned
to
focus
on
detailed
aspects
of
the
problem.
at
first
in
the
brown
case,
there
was
only
the
start
question,
whether
legally
enforced
segregation
was
consistent
with
the
constitution.
this
court
rightly
held
that
it
was
not.
the
problem
was
inappropriately
remitted
to
the
school
boards
and
the
local
courts
to
work
out
the
details.
as
might
be
expected,
it
has
been
found
to
be
a
vastly
complex
problem.
one
can
look
at
it
first
with
a
glass,
and
then
with
the
microscope,
and
the
complexities
and
the
infinite
variations
soon
appear.
actually,
it
has
been
only
in
the
past
few
years
that
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
deal
with
any
of
these
matters
of
application
in
detail.
for
many
years,
school
boards
and
the
courts
too,
to
a
considerable
extent
had
felt
that
compliance
was
reached
under
freedom
of
choice
plans.
it
was
only
two
years
ago
last
may
that
the
court
held
that
freedom
of
choice
plans
alone
were
not
adequate
when
they
did
not
achieve
a
unitary
school
system.
as
for
one
reason
or
another,
they
almost
never
do.
and
it
was
only
a
year
ago
last
june
in
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
case
that
the
court
held
for
the
first
time,
that
a
district
court
could
properly
require
allocation
of
white
and
black
faculty
members
in
equal
proportions
to
all
schools.
and
there
is
nothing
which
more
clearly
marks
a
school
as
black
as
that
it
has
a
wholly
black
faculty.
now,
we
have
another
problem,
in
the
application
of
the
brown
decision,
an
extremely
important
and
difficult
problem.
i
think
i
can
put
the
issue
this
way
without
too
much
over
simplification.
what
is
the
standard
to
be
applied,
or
the
objective
to
be
sought
by
a
school
board
or
by
a
court
in
reviewing
what
the
school
board
has
done
is
the
standard
or
objective
to
achieve
racial
balance?
or
on
the
other
hand,
is
the
standard
or
objective
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
and
to
achieve
a
truly
unitary
system.
our
position
is
that
the
latter
is
the
correct
formulation
of
the
objective.
we
cannot
find
more
in
the
constitutional
command
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
of
due
process
of
law
which
as
far
as
i
know,
are
the
only
constitutional
provisions
and
likewise
the
most
specific
constitutional
provisions
involved
in
this
case.
before
going
further,
i
would
like
to
make
it
as
plain
as
i
can
that
this
not
a
retreat.
there
must
not
be
a
retreat
in
this
area,
where
so
much
has
already
been
done
to
redeem
the
promise
of
america.
i
recognized
too
that
determining
what
is
truly
a
unitary
school
system
may
in
actual
cases
present
practical
problems
of
very
great
difficulty.
my
central
position
is
that
there
is
not
any
basis
for
saying
that
this
can
only
be
achieved
through
racial
balance.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
disclaim
the
phrase
racial
balance,
both
in
their
briefs
and
in
the
argument
today,
but
i
find
a
passage
in
a
brief
which
was
filed
late
last
week.
actually
it's
in
number
436,
the
mobile
case
which
will
be
argued
tomorrow,
this
is
a
supplemental
brief
for
the
petitioners
in
mobile
on
page
three,
where
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
same
counsel
say,
petitioners
submit
that
mobile's
experience
under
the
fifth
circuit
plan
underscores
and
this
is
--
it
seems
to
me,
their
statement
of
their
contention.
the
necessity
for
the
declaration
of
a
constitutional
standard
that
in
a
unitary
school
system
no
--
and
that's
in
italics
--
no
-black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
black
school
at
any
grade
level.
and
i'm
quite
willing
to
accept
that
and
whenever
i
say
racial
balance
that's
what
it
means.
i
don't
understand
how
it
can
be
applied
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
mound
bayou
mississippi,
and
not
to
mention
all
kinds
of
intermediate
situations.
but
getting
back
to
the
question
as
to
what
standard
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
he
may
have
although
again
it
is
expressly
disclaimed
in
the
opinion
but
it
seems
to
me
that
looking
to
what
he
did
and
the
way
he
did
it,
and
i
certainly
have
a
great
understanding
and
sympathy
for
the
problem
with
which
he
was
confronted,
that
he
may
well
have
acted
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
required
to
produce
what
i
have
called
racial
balance
or
what
is
the
defined
as
no
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
school.
if
he
did,
then
i
think
that
he
ought
to
be
required
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
proper
standard,
in
any
event
as
i
will
conclude,
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
come
to
the
place
where
this
court
must
define
what
the
standard
is
and
judge
mcmillan
and
other
courts
can
then
proceed
in
the
light
of
that
standard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
mr.
chambers
said
more
than
51%
made
it
identifiable
as
a
black
school.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
really
the
issue
here
is,
if
whether
there
can
be
any
all
black
schools
in
the
--
on
the
facts
of
these
particular
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
would
be
the
same
in
the
charlotte
case.
there
were
two
all
black
schools
left
under
the
hew
plan
which
was
rejected
by
the
district
court
and
it's
largely
because
of
that
rejection
that
i
conclude
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
judge
acted
on
the
assumption
that
he
must
produce
a
racial
balance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
depends
entirely
on
the
circumstances
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
proper
circumstances,
and
they
maybe
hard
to
find,
but
a
100%
black
is
--
meets
the
constitutional
requirement.
that
is
the
position
that
i'm
taking
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
it
certainly
is
alright.
there
is
no
question
about
the
power
of
the
school
boards
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
the
great
importance
of
the
school
board
should
find
ways
to
exercise
that
power
in
the
meantime
to
improve
facilities
and
programs
there
until
they
can
get
it
brought
about
and
to
bring
about
activities
through
public
housing
programs
and
many
other
programs
to
minimize
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
it
seems
to
me
that
it
gets
back
to
the
question
i
have
put,
what
is
the
objective?
is
the
objective
to
eliminate
racial
balance?
is
to
provide
racial
balance
or
is
the
objective
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
and
establish
a
unitary
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
can
understand
that
position
and
that
is
the
argument
of
mr.
chambers,
i
cannot
find
that
in
the
constitution.
the
constitution
says,
“nor
shall
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.”
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia,
the
only
applicable
provision
is
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
there
is
no
affirmative
state
action
which
produces
or
requires
the
isolation
or
the
separation,
i
cannot
find
in
the
constitution
any
requirement
that
it'd
be
disestablished.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
there
is
a
great
deal
of
state
action
in
the
background
in
charlotte
and
that
of
course
is
an
important
reason
and
for
that
reason
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
and
the
following
case
in
which
we
contend
that
the
--
which
we
join
in
the
contention
that
the
north
carolina
statute
abolishing
busing
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
and
congress
could
do
it,
if
they
wanted
to.
congress
in
my
view,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that's
not
an
issue
that's
here
but
by
legislation
enacted
under
the
fourth
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
believe
that
congress
could
require
that
racial
balance
be
established
in
all
schools.
some
states
have
done
it,
and
massachusetts
had
the
statute
to
that
effect
and
new
york
has
a
regulation
of
the
state
commission
of
education
which
points
in
that
direction.
it
surely
is
an
objective,
my
position
is
that
it
is
not
a
requirement
which
can
properly
be
found
to
be
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
standing
alone.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
they're
intertwined.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
they
are
different
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
different
questions
but
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
contend
that
if
the
right
was
established,
that
the
remedy
could
not
be
devised
to
protect
the
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
there's
nothing
new
in
the
position
which
i
am
taking.
actually
it
seems
to
me
this
is
an
example
of
the
tendency
of
many
points
in
the
law
to
expand
themselves
to
their
logical
extreme.
it's
clear
i
think
that
with
the
success
which
has
so
far
been
achieved,
and
it
is
considerable,
though
in
many
places
not
enough,
there
has
been
an
expansion
of
rising
expectations.
specifically,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
racial
balance
was
not
regarded
as
the
objective.
and
i'm
using
racial
balance
in
the
sense
of
the
brief
from
which
i
have
quoted.
racial
balance
was
not
regarded
as
the
objective
when
the
brown
case
was
presented
before
this
court,
or
when
it
was
decided.
in
the
brown
case,
the
united
states
submitted
three
separate
briefs
for
the
court's
consideration.
one
was
filed
on
december
3,
1952,
and
was
signed
by
attorney
general
mcgranery
and
philip
elman.
the
next
brief
was
filed
in
connection
with
the
re-argument
of
the
cases.
and
was
filed
on
november
27,
1953,
it
was
signed
by
attorney
general
brownell
and
by
assistant
attorney
general
j.
lee
rankin
and
by
others.
and
finally,
a
brief
for
the
united
states
was
filed
in
connection
with
the
further
argument
on
questions
of
relief,
and
this
was
filed
on
november
24,
1954.
it
was
signed
by
attorney
general
brownell,
solicitor
general
sobeloff,
assistant
attorney
general
rankin
and
others.
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
the
same
in
all
of
these
briefs.
i
think
that
all
are
relevant,
but
i
will
quote
only
two
passages.
the
first
in
the
brief
filed
on
the
first
re-argument,
on
november
27,
1953,
and
this
appears
on
page
171
of
that
brief.
it
is
not
unlikely
that
in
many
communities
particularly
where
separate
white
and
colored
residential
districts
still
exist,
abolition
of
segregation
would
produce
no
serious
dislocations
and
no
wholesale
transfers
of
teachers
or
pupils
would
occur.
this
could
result
from
purely
geographical
factors
because
the
pupils
of
a
school
ordinarily
reflect
the
composition
of
the
population
of
the
district
in
which
it
is
located.
and
then
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
filed
in
connection
with
the
further
argument
on
the
question
of
relief,
we
found
the
following
on
page
12.
there's
more
along
the
same
lines
here,
i
have
only
picked
up
the
central
passage.
the
extent
of
the
boundary
alterations
required
in
the
reformulation
of
school
attendants
areas
on
a
non-racial
basis
will
vary.
this
is
illustrated
by
the
recent
experience
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
recasting
attendant's
boundaries
on
a
wholly
geographical
basis.
in
the
neighborhoods
where
there
is
little
or
no
mixtures
of
races
and
where
school
facilities
had
been
fully
utilized,
it
was
found
that
the
elimination
of
the
racial
factor
did
not
work
any
material
change
in
the
territory
served
by
each
school.
and
by
a
racial
neighborhoods
however,
the
objective
of
securing
maximum
utilization
of
facilities
on
a
non-racial
basis,
could
be
achieved
only
by
making
radical
revisions
in
the
area
covered
by
the
formerly
negro
and
white
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
before
i
proceed
to
the
chief
justices'
question,
i
would
like
to
finish
the
theme
of
the
argument
which
i
was
pursuing
when
the
court
recessed.
i
had
just
quoted
from
the
briefs
filed
by
the
government,
15
and
16
years
ago,
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
bear
in
mind
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
was
in
the
second
and
the
third
argument
mr.
justice,
those
briefs
i
quoted
from.
but
in
connection
with
the
second
argument
and
also
the
third
argument,
the
court
propounded
specific
questions
to
counsel,
these
appear
in
347
u.s.
at
pages
495
and
496,
and
4
(a)
was
this
was
the
question
of
the
court
at
that
time.
assuming
it
is
decided
that
segregation
in
public
schools
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
(a)
would
a
decree
necessarily
follow
providing
that
within
the
limits
set
by
normal
geographic
school
districting,
negro
children
should
forth
with
be
admitted
to
schools
of
their
choice.
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
court
there
was
contemplating
limits
set
by
normal
geographic
school
districting.
now
the
oral
arguments
of
all
three
of
those
cases
have
been
printed
in
a
book
called
argument,
and
if
they
are
examined,
it
is
found
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
there
proceeded
on
the
same
basis,
that
the
contention
was
not
in
favor
of
racial
balance
or
the
new
formulation
of
that
which
appears
in
the
present
brief,
but
was
in
terms
of
eliminating
a
dual
school
system.
and
then
finally,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
in
the
--
in
brown
too
in
349
u.s.,
i
think
we
find
recognition
of
this
understanding
of
the
court
and
this
appears
in
the
opinion
to
that
end,
the
courts
may
consider
problems
related
to
administration
arising
from
the
physical
condition
of
the
school
plan,
the
school
transportation
system,
personnel
and
here
is
the
important
passage,
“revision
of
school
districts
and
attendant's
areas
into
compact
units,
to
achieve
a
system
of
determining
admission
to
the
public
schools
on
a
non-racial
basis.
it's
apparent
i
think
that
16
years
ago,
when
brown
was
decided
and
15
years
ago
on
the
decision
on
remedies
was
announced.
the
objective
was
not
racial
balance
and
or
the
related
objective
is
stated
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
the
conception
of
racial
balance
is
something
rather
new,
and
it
has
a
reason
out
of
our
experience
in
the
intervening
years.
i
think
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
racial
balance
in
many
situations.
but
my
submission
is
that
it
was
not
thought
to
be
the
standard
or
objective
when
brown
case
was
considered
or
decided,
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
today
be
properly
found
within
the
text
or
within
the
appropriate
penumbra
of
the
two
constitutional
provisions
which
are
applicable
in
this
case.
certainly
this
court
has
never
so
decided.
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice,
if
the
court
will
examine
our
brief
with
great
care,
you
will
find
that
we
have
never
contended,
we
have
never
used
the
word
reasonable.
we
have
used
it
when
we
quoted
from
opinions,
but
we
have
never
used
the
work
reasonable.
the
word
which
we
have
used
is
feasible.
and
how
far
that
is
different
from
reasonable?
is
perhaps
a
question,
i
think
it
is
some
different
and
i
will
refer
to
it,
one
of
the
chief
reasons
we
have
used
feasible
is
because
that
is
what
the
court
used
in
the
green
opinion.
where
the
court
said
that
it
was
incumbent
for
the
federal
courts
to
assess
the
school
boards
proposals
under
the
orders
of
the
court
in
light
of
the
facts
at
hand,
and
in
light
of
any
alternatives
which
maybe
shown
as
feasible
and
more
promising
in
their
effectiveness.
now
i
think
that
feasible
is
a
stronger
word
than
reasonable.
reasonable
is
a
somewhat
negative
word.
oh!
well
you
don't
have
to
do
that
because
it
would
be
reasonable,
whereas
to
me
feasible
has
a
strong
affirmative
connotation,
you
must
do
it
if
you
can.
you
must
do
it
if
it
is
feasible.
feasible
means
practicable.
i
would
point
out
that
even
the
petitioner's
have
some
qualification
in
their
statement
of
the
situation,
perhaps
that
appears
best
in
their
brief
in
the
mobile
case
on
page
75,
their
phrase
is,
“absolute
unworkability”
now
that
is
certainly
vastly
stronger
than
feasible
but
even
that
shows
that
there
are
circumstances
where
they
can
see
that
that
doesn't
have
to
be
done.
their
wording
is,
“we
believe
that
our
proposed
principle,
forbidding
relocation
of
pupils
to
black
schools
except
in
cases
of
absolute
unworkability
of
integration
plans,
has
a
number
of
merits.”
now
we
believe
that
under
the
test
of
feasibility,
which
we
contend
for,
that
there
is
a
strong
governmental
obligation.
an
obligation
not
only
on
the
courts
but
also
on
the
school
boards,
to
--
not
only
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system,
but
to
eliminate
the
vestiges
of
a
dual
school
system,
and
here
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
dual
school
system,
we're
really
down
to
1965
maybe
a
completely
dual
school
system
down
to
1965
in
charlotte.
in
mobile
down
to
1969
and
that
much
of
the
present
picture
is
a
vestige
of
the
situation
which
arose
at
that
time.
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
very
strong
obligation
on
the
school
boards
and
the
courts
to
eliminate
not
only
the
dual
school
system
but
the
vestiges
of
the
dual
school
system.
in
that
connection
i
would
point
out
some
things
to
which
reference
has
not
been
made,
steps
have
now
been
taken
in
charlotte
to
provide
for
adjustment
of
faculties,
so
that
they
are
no
longer
are
white
faculties
or
black
faculties
in
any
school.
under
the
orders
of
the
court,
which
we
support
segregation
and
busing,
has
been
eliminated
and
finally
there
is
even
with
respect
to
these
children
in
the
all
black
schools
who
would
be
left
in
the
two
all
black
schools
under
the
hew
plan,
there
is
free
majority
to
minority
election
of,
so
that
any
black
student
who
wishes
to
go
to
a
school
which
is
not
all
black,
i
know
all
the
problems
of
that
but
still
the
fact
is,
that
he
can
go
to
another
school
under
the
government's
plan,
it
was
not
included
under
judge
mcmillan's
plan
because
he
left
no
all
black
schools.
but
under
the
mobile
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
such
children
must
be
provided
with
busing
and
they
are
given
a
priority
in
the
school
to
which
they
go,
they
cannot
be
told,
“you
cannot
go
to
that
school
because
it
is
already
overcrowded.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
it
becomes
a
question
only
with
the
amount
and
the
distance
of
the
busing,
and
there
is
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
which
is
relevant
there.
there
are
no
problems
in
the
charlotte
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
with
respect
to
high
schools
and
junior
high
schools.
we
have
supported
throughout
the
decision
of
the
court
which
leaves
no
all
black
high
schools
and
junior
high
schools
and
requires
a
substantial
amount
of
busing.
the
problem
arises
exclusively
with
respect
to
elementary
schools
and
that
becomes
relevant
with
respect
to
this
question
of
feasibility.
you're
dealing
with
very
small
children
and
the
distances
of
busing
are
relevant.
the
taking
away
from
their
home
areas
are
relevant.
i
know
that
in
countywide
consolidated
schools,
small
children
are
bused
to
ong
ways
but
there
you
have
the
question
of
feasibility
on
the
other
side.
the
all
one
room
school
house
no
longer
became
feasible
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
handled
in
an
obvious
improvement
was
to
take
the
children
in
to
the
centralized
school.
so,
in
many
ways
the
word
should
close
together,
but
we
feel
there's
something
much
stronger
than
merely
reasonable
action
as
required.
the
word
we
have
found
to
use
is
feasible
but
that
might
well
be
backed
up
with
further
language
to
the
effect
that
this
is
not
meant
in
the
passive
way.
it
is
meant
in
an
active
way,
and
that
in
particular
where
there
are
vestiges
of
a
dual
school
system,
continuing
steps
must
be
taken
to
eliminate
those
vestiges
but
that
finally,
the
test,
the
standard
is
not
whether
when
you
get
sued
doing
all
that
is
feasible,
there
remains
one
or
more
all
black
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
of
course.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
those
assignments
were
made
explicitly
by
taking
race
into
account.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
absent
that
or
absent
any
action
by
a
congress
under
section
four
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
i
think
could
also
make
this
as
a
requirement,
or
state
statutes
as
in
massachusetts,
but
assuming
that
there
is
a
school
zone
whether
there
is
no
vestige
of
prior
discrimination,
then
i
think
that
put
it
a
nutshell,
our
position
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
the
elimination
of
all
black
or
all
white
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
there
are
number
of
these
devices
which
have
been
developed.
we
have
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
here
we
have
what
clearly
was
a
dual
school
system
and
which
clearly
has
substantial
vestiges
of
a
dual
school
system
and
a
great
deal
of
the
existing
allocation
of
students
is
the
immediate
consequence
of
the
way
the
school
system
was
operated
in
the
past.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
very
hard
to
tell,
and
our
position
is
that
under
the
hew
plan
in
this
case,
all
that
was
feasible
would
have
been
done
leaving
to
all
black
schools.
and
the
judge
went
somewhat
further
in
order
to
eliminate
those
two
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
we
have
put
it
on
a
conditional
basis
in
our
brief.
it
seems
to
us
it
depends
upon
what
standard
judge
mcmillan
used
or
what
objective
he
sought
to
reach.
if
he
felt
that
he
was
required
to
eliminate
all
black
schools,
we
think
he
used
the
wrong
standard.
or
putting
it
in
another
way,
if
he
felt
that
he
was
required
to
meet
a
test
of
racial
balance
in
all
schools,
we
think
he
used
the
wrong
standard.
if
on
the
other
hand,
he
didn't
seek
that
objective,
if
all
he
was
trying
to
do
is
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
including
the
consequences
of
past
discrimination,
then
we
think
that
the
result
was
within
the
limits
of
his
discretion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
not
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
--
as
counsel
on
my
left
will
say
that
when
those
cases
come,
they
will
build
a
record
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
can
show
a
good
deal.
i
think
in
many
parts
of
the
north,
they
couldn't
show
racial
zoning
for
example,
which
existed
in
the
charlotte
case,
racial
restricted
covenants
probably
have
been
utilized
in
a
great
many
places,
and
the
decisions
of
school
boards
and
of
housing
authorities
and
where
to
place
a
housing
projects
and
where
to
build
schools
are
probably
there.
and
all
i
would
say
is
that
where
it
can
be
shown
that
existing
discrimination
is
in
part
a
consequence
of
past
discriminatory
decisions
made
by
public
officials,
that
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
situation
where
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
court
can
properly
intervene
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
these
are
all
questions
of
degree.
in
mobile,
i
suppose
we
have
it
in
the
degree
in
the
highest
intensity
and
charlotte
somewhat
less,
i
suppose
in
northern
cities,
you
can
find
quite
a
bit
but
still
a
great
deal
less.
in
particular
there
never
has
been
a
dual
school
system
as
such.
there
never
have
been
--
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
areas
in
which
i
am
familiar,
there
have
not
been
overlapping
attendant
zones
which
is
what
i
mean
by
dual
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
it
ought
to
be
remanded
to
him
to
find
out
whether
he
felt
that
he
was
applying
the
standard
that
he
had
to
eliminate
all
black
schools.
i
think
what
the
court
should
do
is
to
establish
what
is
the
proper
test
or
standard
here
and
then
remand
these
cases
to
the
lower
courts
for
the
application
of
that
standard.
if
in
the
light
of
that
standard,
judge
mcmillan
should
still
come
out
with
the
same
remedy,
i
would
think
there
would
be
much
to
be
said
in
support
of
his
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
all
turns
on
what
his
standard
or
his
objective
was.
if
he
felt
that
his
requirement
was
that
he
eliminate
all
black
schools,
he
said,
“i
can
do
that
and
it's
feasible.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
he
said,
“i
can
do
it
and
it
is
feasible.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
if
the
requirement
is
not
to
eliminate
all
black
schools,
if
the
requirement
on
the
contrary
is
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
and
to
establish
a
unitary
school
system,
he
need
not
have
required
as
much
as
he
did
require
to
achieve
that
other
standard
which
is
the
standard
that
we
think
is
all
that
can
be
found
in
the
constitution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
perhaps
he
was
in
error.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
a
long
road,
we've
made
substantial
progress
and
this
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
few
today
question
the
central
rightness
of
the
decision
which
was
reached
by
this
court
in
brown
against
the
board
of
education
16
years
ago.
it's
true
that
16
years
have
passed,
but
in
this
connection
that
may
be
observed
that
the
brown
case
itself
was
twice
argued
in
this
court,
and
before
the
initial
decision,
that
it
was
pending
here
for
two-and-a-half
years
before
it
was
decided.
it
was
also
here
in
additional
year
or
a
total
of
three-and-a-half
years
when
the
case
was
set
down
for
further
argument
with
respect
to
remedy.
for
many
years,
there
was
a
serious
problem
simply
in
getting
the
decision
accepted.
i
need
not
recall
little
rock
and
oxford
in
the
confrontation
at
the
university
of
alabama.
all
of
that
is
in
the
past
now,
and
fortunately
and
wisely
so.
because
of
this
situation,
the
court
has
only
recently
had
occasioned
to
consider
the
many
problems
of
detail,
which
arise
in
the
application
of
the
brown
decision.
on
the
basis
of
a
careful
survey,
i
find
that
there
are
25
school
cases
which
have
been
decided
on
the
merits
by
this
court
in
the
16
years
since
brown
was
decided.
many
of
these
are
per
curiam
decisions.
one
was
cooper
and
aaron
which
arose
out
of
the
little
rock
situation.
other
cases
involved
various
aspects
of
so-called
massive
resistance
and
interposition,
such
as
bush
against
the
orleans
parish
school
board.
then
only
six
years
ago,
in
griffin
against
prince
edward
county,
the
court
held
the
schools
could
not
be
closed
while
public
money
was
meant
to
support
private
white
only
schools.
during
these
years,
many
hundreds
of
cases
were
decided
in
lower
federal
courts
and
great
determination
and
courage
was
shown
there.
not
until
recently,
however,
has
this
court
had
occasioned
to
focus
on
detailed
aspects
of
the
problem.
at
first
in
the
brown
case,
there
was
only
the
start
question,
whether
legally
enforced
segregation
was
consistent
with
the
constitution.
this
court
rightly
held
that
it
was
not.
the
problem
was
inappropriately
remitted
to
the
school
boards
and
the
local
courts
to
work
out
the
details.
as
might
be
expected,
it
has
been
found
to
be
a
vastly
complex
problem.
one
can
look
at
it
first
with
a
glass,
and
then
with
the
microscope,
and
the
complexities
and
the
infinite
variations
soon
appear.
actually,
it
has
been
only
in
the
past
few
years
that
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
deal
with
any
of
these
matters
of
application
in
detail.
for
many
years,
school
boards
and
the
courts
too,
to
a
considerable
extent
had
felt
that
compliance
was
reached
under
freedom
of
choice
plans.
it
was
only
two
years
ago
last
may
that
the
court
held
that
freedom
of
choice
plans
alone
were
not
adequate
when
they
did
not
achieve
a
unitary
school
system.
as
for
one
reason
or
another,
they
almost
never
do.
and
it
was
only
a
year
ago
last
june
in
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
case
that
the
court
held
for
the
first
time,
that
a
district
court
could
properly
require
allocation
of
white
and
black
faculty
members
in
equal
proportions
to
all
schools.
and
there
is
nothing
which
more
clearly
marks
a
school
as
black
as
that
it
has
a
wholly
black
faculty.
now,
we
have
another
problem,
in
the
application
of
the
brown
decision,
an
extremely
important
and
difficult
problem.
i
think
i
can
put
the
issue
this
way
without
too
much
over
simplification.
what
is
the
standard
to
be
applied,
or
the
objective
to
be
sought
by
a
school
board
or
by
a
court
in
reviewing
what
the
school
board
has
done
is
the
standard
or
objective
to
achieve
racial
balance?
or
on
the
other
hand,
is
the
standard
or
objective
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
and
to
achieve
a
truly
unitary
system.
our
position
is
that
the
latter
is
the
correct
formulation
of
the
objective.
we
cannot
find
more
in
the
constitutional
command
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
of
due
process
of
law
which
as
far
as
i
know,
are
the
only
constitutional
provisions
and
likewise
the
most
specific
constitutional
provisions
involved
in
this
case.
before
going
further,
i
would
like
to
make
it
as
plain
as
i
can
that
this
not
a
retreat.
there
must
not
be
a
retreat
in
this
area,
where
so
much
has
already
been
done
to
redeem
the
promise
of
america.
i
recognized
too
that
determining
what
is
truly
a
unitary
school
system
may
in
actual
cases
present
practical
problems
of
very
great
difficulty.
my
central
position
is
that
there
is
not
any
basis
for
saying
that
this
can
only
be
achieved
through
racial
balance.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
disclaim
the
phrase
racial
balance,
both
in
their
briefs
and
in
the
argument
today,
but
i
find
a
passage
in
a
brief
which
was
filed
late
last
week.
actually
it's
in
number
436,
the
mobile
case
which
will
be
argued
tomorrow,
this
is
a
supplemental
brief
for
the
petitioners
in
mobile
on
page
three,
where
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
same
counsel
say,
petitioners
submit
that
mobile's
experience
under
the
fifth
circuit
plan
underscores
and
this
is
--
it
seems
to
me,
their
statement
of
their
contention.
the
necessity
for
the
declaration
of
a
constitutional
standard
that
in
a
unitary
school
system
no
--
and
that's
in
italics
--
no
-black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
black
school
at
any
grade
level.
and
i'm
quite
willing
to
accept
that
and
whenever
i
say
racial
balance
that's
what
it
means.
i
don't
understand
how
it
can
be
applied
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
mound
bayou
mississippi,
and
not
to
mention
all
kinds
of
intermediate
situations.
but
getting
back
to
the
question
as
to
what
standard
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
he
may
have
although
again
it
is
expressly
disclaimed
in
the
opinion
but
it
seems
to
me
that
looking
to
what
he
did
and
the
way
he
did
it,
and
i
certainly
have
a
great
understanding
and
sympathy
for
the
problem
with
which
he
was
confronted,
that
he
may
well
have
acted
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
required
to
produce
what
i
have
called
racial
balance
or
what
is
the
defined
as
no
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
school.
if
he
did,
then
i
think
that
he
ought
to
be
required
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
proper
standard,
in
any
event
as
i
will
conclude,
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
come
to
the
place
where
this
court
must
define
what
the
standard
is
and
judge
mcmillan
and
other
courts
can
then
proceed
in
the
light
of
that
standard.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
mr.
chambers
said
more
than
51%
made
it
identifiable
as
a
black
school.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
really
the
issue
here
is,
if
whether
there
can
be
any
all
black
schools
in
the
--
on
the
facts
of
these
particular
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
would
be
the
same
in
the
charlotte
case.
there
were
two
all
black
schools
left
under
the
hew
plan
which
was
rejected
by
the
district
court
and
it's
largely
because
of
that
rejection
that
i
conclude
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
judge
acted
on
the
assumption
that
he
must
produce
a
racial
balance.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
depends
entirely
on
the
circumstances
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
proper
circumstances,
and
they
maybe
hard
to
find,
but
a
100%
black
is
--
meets
the
constitutional
requirement.
that
is
the
position
that
i'm
taking
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
it
certainly
is
alright.
there
is
no
question
about
the
power
of
the
school
boards
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
the
great
importance
of
the
school
board
should
find
ways
to
exercise
that
power
in
the
meantime
to
improve
facilities
and
programs
there
until
they
can
get
it
brought
about
and
to
bring
about
activities
through
public
housing
programs
and
many
other
programs
to
minimize
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
it
seems
to
me
that
it
gets
back
to
the
question
i
have
put,
what
is
the
objective?
is
the
objective
to
eliminate
racial
balance?
is
to
provide
racial
balance
or
is
the
objective
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
and
establish
a
unitary
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
i
can
understand
that
position
and
that
is
the
argument
of
mr.
chambers,
i
cannot
find
that
in
the
constitution.
the
constitution
says,
“nor
shall
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.”
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia,
the
only
applicable
provision
is
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
there
is
no
affirmative
state
action
which
produces
or
requires
the
isolation
or
the
separation,
i
cannot
find
in
the
constitution
any
requirement
that
it'd
be
disestablished.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
there
is
a
great
deal
of
state
action
in
the
background
in
charlotte
and
that
of
course
is
an
important
reason
and
for
that
reason
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
and
the
following
case
in
which
we
contend
that
the
--
which
we
join
in
the
contention
that
the
north
carolina
statute
abolishing
busing
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
and
congress
could
do
it,
if
they
wanted
to.
congress
in
my
view,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that's
not
an
issue
that's
here
but
by
legislation
enacted
under
the
fourth
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
believe
that
congress
could
require
that
racial
balance
be
established
in
all
schools.
some
states
have
done
it,
and
massachusetts
had
the
statute
to
that
effect
and
new
york
has
a
regulation
of
the
state
commission
of
education
which
points
in
that
direction.
it
surely
is
an
objective,
my
position
is
that
it
is
not
a
requirement
which
can
properly
be
found
to
be
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
standing
alone.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
they're
intertwined.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
they
are
different
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
different
questions
but
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
contend
that
if
the
right
was
established,
that
the
remedy
could
not
be
devised
to
protect
the
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
there's
nothing
new
in
the
position
which
i
am
taking.
actually
it
seems
to
me
this
is
an
example
of
the
tendency
of
many
points
in
the
law
to
expand
themselves
to
their
logical
extreme.
it's
clear
i
think
that
with
the
success
which
has
so
far
been
achieved,
and
it
is
considerable,
though
in
many
places
not
enough,
there
has
been
an
expansion
of
rising
expectations.
specifically,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
racial
balance
was
not
regarded
as
the
objective.
and
i'm
using
racial
balance
in
the
sense
of
the
brief
from
which
i
have
quoted.
racial
balance
was
not
regarded
as
the
objective
when
the
brown
case
was
presented
before
this
court,
or
when
it
was
decided.
in
the
brown
case,
the
united
states
submitted
three
separate
briefs
for
the
court's
consideration.
one
was
filed
on
december
3,
1952,
and
was
signed
by
attorney
general
mcgranery
and
philip
elman.
the
next
brief
was
filed
in
connection
with
the
re-argument
of
the
cases.
and
was
filed
on
november
27,
1953,
it
was
signed
by
attorney
general
brownell
and
by
assistant
attorney
general
j.
lee
rankin
and
by
others.
and
finally,
a
brief
for
the
united
states
was
filed
in
connection
with
the
further
argument
on
questions
of
relief,
and
this
was
filed
on
november
24,
1954.
it
was
signed
by
attorney
general
brownell,
solicitor
general
sobeloff,
assistant
attorney
general
rankin
and
others.
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
the
same
in
all
of
these
briefs.
i
think
that
all
are
relevant,
but
i
will
quote
only
two
passages.
the
first
in
the
brief
filed
on
the
first
re-argument,
on
november
27,
1953,
and
this
appears
on
page
171
of
that
brief.
it
is
not
unlikely
that
in
many
communities
particularly
where
separate
white
and
colored
residential
districts
still
exist,
abolition
of
segregation
would
produce
no
serious
dislocations
and
no
wholesale
transfers
of
teachers
or
pupils
would
occur.
this
could
result
from
purely
geographical
factors
because
the
pupils
of
a
school
ordinarily
reflect
the
composition
of
the
population
of
the
district
in
which
it
is
located.
and
then
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
filed
in
connection
with
the
further
argument
on
the
question
of
relief,
we
found
the
following
on
page
12.
there's
more
along
the
same
lines
here,
i
have
only
picked
up
the
central
passage.
the
extent
of
the
boundary
alterations
required
in
the
reformulation
of
school
attendants
areas
on
a
non-racial
basis
will
vary.
this
is
illustrated
by
the
recent
experience
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
recasting
attendant's
boundaries
on
a
wholly
geographical
basis.
in
the
neighborhoods
where
there
is
little
or
no
mixtures
of
races
and
where
school
facilities
had
been
fully
utilized,
it
was
found
that
the
elimination
of
the
racial
factor
did
not
work
any
material
change
in
the
territory
served
by
each
school.
and
by
a
racial
neighborhoods
however,
the
objective
of
securing
maximum
utilization
of
facilities
on
a
non-racial
basis,
could
be
achieved
only
by
making
radical
revisions
in
the
area
covered
by
the
formerly
negro
and
white
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
before
i
proceed
to
the
chief
justices'
question,
i
would
like
to
finish
the
theme
of
the
argument
which
i
was
pursuing
when
the
court
recessed.
i
had
just
quoted
from
the
briefs
filed
by
the
government,
15
and
16
years
ago,
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
bear
in
mind
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
was
in
the
second
and
the
third
argument
mr.
justice,
those
briefs
i
quoted
from.
but
in
connection
with
the
second
argument
and
also
the
third
argument,
the
court
propounded
specific
questions
to
counsel,
these
appear
in
347
u.s.
at
pages
495
and
496,
and
4
(a)
was
this
was
the
question
of
the
court
at
that
time.
assuming
it
is
decided
that
segregation
in
public
schools
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
(a)
would
a
decree
necessarily
follow
providing
that
within
the
limits
set
by
normal
geographic
school
districting,
negro
children
should
forth
with
be
admitted
to
schools
of
their
choice.
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
court
there
was
contemplating
limits
set
by
normal
geographic
school
districting.
now
the
oral
arguments
of
all
three
of
those
cases
have
been
printed
in
a
book
called
argument,
and
if
they
are
examined,
it
is
found
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
there
proceeded
on
the
same
basis,
that
the
contention
was
not
in
favor
of
racial
balance
or
the
new
formulation
of
that
which
appears
in
the
present
brief,
but
was
in
terms
of
eliminating
a
dual
school
system.
and
then
finally,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
in
the
--
in
brown
too
in
349
u.s.,
i
think
we
find
recognition
of
this
understanding
of
the
court
and
this
appears
in
the
opinion
to
that
end,
the
courts
may
consider
problems
related
to
administration
arising
from
the
physical
condition
of
the
school
plan,
the
school
transportation
system,
personnel
and
here
is
the
important
passage,
“revision
of
school
districts
and
attendant's
areas
into
compact
units,
to
achieve
a
system
of
determining
admission
to
the
public
schools
on
a
non-racial
basis.
it's
apparent
i
think
that
16
years
ago,
when
brown
was
decided
and
15
years
ago
on
the
decision
on
remedies
was
announced.
the
objective
was
not
racial
balance
and
or
the
related
objective
is
stated
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
the
conception
of
racial
balance
is
something
rather
new,
and
it
has
a
reason
out
of
our
experience
in
the
intervening
years.
i
think
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
racial
balance
in
many
situations.
but
my
submission
is
that
it
was
not
thought
to
be
the
standard
or
objective
when
brown
case
was
considered
or
decided,
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
today
be
properly
found
within
the
text
or
within
the
appropriate
penumbra
of
the
two
constitutional
provisions
which
are
applicable
in
this
case.
certainly
this
court
has
never
so
decided.
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice,
if
the
court
will
examine
our
brief
with
great
care,
you
will
find
that
we
have
never
contended,
we
have
never
used
the
word
reasonable.
we
have
used
it
when
we
quoted
from
opinions,
but
we
have
never
used
the
work
reasonable.
the
word
which
we
have
used
is
feasible.
and
how
far
that
is
different
from
reasonable?
is
perhaps
a
question,
i
think
it
is
some
different
and
i
will
refer
to
it,
one
of
the
chief
reasons
we
have
used
feasible
is
because
that
is
what
the
court
used
in
the
green
opinion.
where
the
court
said
that
it
was
incumbent
for
the
federal
courts
to
assess
the
school
boards
proposals
under
the
orders
of
the
court
in
light
of
the
facts
at
hand,
and
in
light
of
any
alternatives
which
maybe
shown
as
feasible
and
more
promising
in
their
effectiveness.
now
i
think
that
feasible
is
a
stronger
word
than
reasonable.
reasonable
is
a
somewhat
negative
word.
oh!
well
you
don't
have
to
do
that
because
it
would
be
reasonable,
whereas
to
me
feasible
has
a
strong
affirmative
connotation,
you
must
do
it
if
you
can.
you
must
do
it
if
it
is
feasible.
feasible
means
practicable.
i
would
point
out
that
even
the
petitioner's
have
some
qualification
in
their
statement
of
the
situation,
perhaps
that
appears
best
in
their
brief
in
the
mobile
case
on
page
75,
their
phrase
is,
“absolute
unworkability”
now
that
is
certainly
vastly
stronger
than
feasible
but
even
that
shows
that
there
are
circumstances
where
they
can
see
that
that
doesn't
have
to
be
done.
their
wording
is,
“we
believe
that
our
proposed
principle,
forbidding
relocation
of
pupils
to
black
schools
except
in
cases
of
absolute
unworkability
of
integration
plans,
has
a
number
of
merits.”
now
we
believe
that
under
the
test
of
feasibility,
which
we
contend
for,
that
there
is
a
strong
governmental
obligation.
an
obligation
not
only
on
the
courts
but
also
on
the
school
boards,
to
--
not
only
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system,
but
to
eliminate
the
vestiges
of
a
dual
school
system,
and
here
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
dual
school
system,
we're
really
down
to
1965
maybe
a
completely
dual
school
system
down
to
1965
in
charlotte.
in
mobile
down
to
1969
and
that
much
of
the
present
picture
is
a
vestige
of
the
situation
which
arose
at
that
time.
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
very
strong
obligation
on
the
school
boards
and
the
courts
to
eliminate
not
only
the
dual
school
system
but
the
vestiges
of
the
dual
school
system.
in
that
connection
i
would
point
out
some
things
to
which
reference
has
not
been
made,
steps
have
now
been
taken
in
charlotte
to
provide
for
adjustment
of
faculties,
so
that
they
are
no
longer
are
white
faculties
or
black
faculties
in
any
school.
under
the
orders
of
the
court,
which
we
support
segregation
and
busing,
has
been
eliminated
and
finally
there
is
even
with
respect
to
these
children
in
the
all
black
schools
who
would
be
left
in
the
two
all
black
schools
under
the
hew
plan,
there
is
free
majority
to
minority
election
of,
so
that
any
black
student
who
wishes
to
go
to
a
school
which
is
not
all
black,
i
know
all
the
problems
of
that
but
still
the
fact
is,
that
he
can
go
to
another
school
under
the
government's
plan,
it
was
not
included
under
judge
mcmillan's
plan
because
he
left
no
all
black
schools.
but
under
the
mobile
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
such
children
must
be
provided
with
busing
and
they
are
given
a
priority
in
the
school
to
which
they
go,
they
cannot
be
told,
“you
cannot
go
to
that
school
because
it
is
already
overcrowded.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
it
becomes
a
question
only
with
the
amount
and
the
distance
of
the
busing,
and
there
is
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
which
is
relevant
there.
there
are
no
problems
in
the
charlotte
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
with
respect
to
high
schools
and
junior
high
schools.
we
have
supported
throughout
the
decision
of
the
court
which
leaves
no
all
black
high
schools
and
junior
high
schools
and
requires
a
substantial
amount
of
busing.
the
problem
arises
exclusively
with
respect
to
elementary
schools
and
that
becomes
relevant
with
respect
to
this
question
of
feasibility.
you're
dealing
with
very
small
children
and
the
distances
of
busing
are
relevant.
the
taking
away
from
their
home
areas
are
relevant.
i
know
that
in
countywide
consolidated
schools,
small
children
are
bused
to
ong
ways
but
there
you
have
the
question
of
feasibility
on
the
other
side.
the
all
one
room
school
house
no
longer
became
feasible
and
the
only
way
it
could
be
handled
in
an
obvious
improvement
was
to
take
the
children
in
to
the
centralized
school.
so,
in
many
ways
the
word
should
close
together,
but
we
feel
there's
something
much
stronger
than
merely
reasonable
action
as
required.
the
word
we
have
found
to
use
is
feasible
but
that
might
well
be
backed
up
with
further
language
to
the
effect
that
this
is
not
meant
in
the
passive
way.
it
is
meant
in
an
active
way,
and
that
in
particular
where
there
are
vestiges
of
a
dual
school
system,
continuing
steps
must
be
taken
to
eliminate
those
vestiges
but
that
finally,
the
test,
the
standard
is
not
whether
when
you
get
sued
doing
all
that
is
feasible,
there
remains
one
or
more
all
black
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
of
course.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
though
those
assignments
were
made
explicitly
by
taking
race
into
account.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
absent
that
or
absent
any
action
by
a
congress
under
section
four
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
i
think
could
also
make
this
as
a
requirement,
or
state
statutes
as
in
massachusetts,
but
assuming
that
there
is
a
school
zone
whether
there
is
no
vestige
of
prior
discrimination,
then
i
think
that
put
it
a
nutshell,
our
position
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
the
elimination
of
all
black
or
all
white
schools.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
there
are
number
of
these
devices
which
have
been
developed.
we
have
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
here
we
have
what
clearly
was
a
dual
school
system
and
which
clearly
has
substantial
vestiges
of
a
dual
school
system
and
a
great
deal
of
the
existing
allocation
of
students
is
the
immediate
consequence
of
the
way
the
school
system
was
operated
in
the
past.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
very
hard
to
tell,
and
our
position
is
that
under
the
hew
plan
in
this
case,
all
that
was
feasible
would
have
been
done
leaving
to
all
black
schools.
and
the
judge
went
somewhat
further
in
order
to
eliminate
those
two
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
we
have
put
it
on
a
conditional
basis
in
our
brief.
it
seems
to
us
it
depends
upon
what
standard
judge
mcmillan
used
or
what
objective
he
sought
to
reach.
if
he
felt
that
he
was
required
to
eliminate
all
black
schools,
we
think
he
used
the
wrong
standard.
or
putting
it
in
another
way,
if
he
felt
that
he
was
required
to
meet
a
test
of
racial
balance
in
all
schools,
we
think
he
used
the
wrong
standard.
if
on
the
other
hand,
he
didn't
seek
that
objective,
if
all
he
was
trying
to
do
is
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
including
the
consequences
of
past
discrimination,
then
we
think
that
the
result
was
within
the
limits
of
his
discretion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
not
all.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
--
as
counsel
on
my
left
will
say
that
when
those
cases
come,
they
will
build
a
record
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
can
show
a
good
deal.
i
think
in
many
parts
of
the
north,
they
couldn't
show
racial
zoning
for
example,
which
existed
in
the
charlotte
case,
racial
restricted
covenants
probably
have
been
utilized
in
a
great
many
places,
and
the
decisions
of
school
boards
and
of
housing
authorities
and
where
to
place
a
housing
projects
and
where
to
build
schools
are
probably
there.
and
all
i
would
say
is
that
where
it
can
be
shown
that
existing
discrimination
is
in
part
a
consequence
of
past
discriminatory
decisions
made
by
public
officials,
that
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
situation
where
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
court
can
properly
intervene
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
these
are
all
questions
of
degree.
in
mobile,
i
suppose
we
have
it
in
the
degree
in
the
highest
intensity
and
charlotte
somewhat
less,
i
suppose
in
northern
cities,
you
can
find
quite
a
bit
but
still
a
great
deal
less.
in
particular
there
never
has
been
a
dual
school
system
as
such.
there
never
have
been
--
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
areas
in
which
i
am
familiar,
there
have
not
been
overlapping
attendant
zones
which
is
what
i
mean
by
dual
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
it
ought
to
be
remanded
to
him
to
find
out
whether
he
felt
that
he
was
applying
the
standard
that
he
had
to
eliminate
all
black
schools.
i
think
what
the
court
should
do
is
to
establish
what
is
the
proper
test
or
standard
here
and
then
remand
these
cases
to
the
lower
courts
for
the
application
of
that
standard.
if
in
the
light
of
that
standard,
judge
mcmillan
should
still
come
out
with
the
same
remedy,
i
would
think
there
would
be
much
to
be
said
in
support
of
his
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
all
turns
on
what
his
standard
or
his
objective
was.
if
he
felt
that
his
requirement
was
that
he
eliminate
all
black
schools,
he
said,
“i
can
do
that
and
it's
feasible.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
he
said,
“i
can
do
it
and
it
is
feasible.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
if
the
requirement
is
not
to
eliminate
all
black
schools,
if
the
requirement
on
the
contrary
is
to
disestablish
a
dual
school
system
and
to
establish
a
unitary
school
system,
he
need
not
have
required
as
much
as
he
did
require
to
achieve
that
other
standard
which
is
the
standard
that
we
think
is
all
that
can
be
found
in
the
constitution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
perhaps
he
was
in
error.
