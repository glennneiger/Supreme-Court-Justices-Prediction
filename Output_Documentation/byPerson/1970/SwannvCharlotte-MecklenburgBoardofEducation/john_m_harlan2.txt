do
you
think
the
basis
was
for
the
court
of
appeals
setting
aside
of
the
district
court's
busing
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that
busing
was
an
impermissible
tool?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
let
me
put
another
question
to
you
which
perhaps
is
related
to
this.
what
do
you
concede
to
be
the
difference
between
the
green
feasible
test
as
i
understand
you
call
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
fields
reasonableness
test
as
the
measure
of
the
obligation
to
disestablish.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
green
test
could
also
contemplate
that
too
or
just
prevent
that
much
module,
if
it
isn't
feasible,
is
it
--
if
it
isn't
feasible
to
abolish
every
black
school,
then
they
would
permit
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
the
court
of
appeals
also
at
least
should
assume
that
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
we
got
that
problem
to
these
cases
–(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
down
in
mecklenburg.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do
not
contend
i
take
it
that
busing
as
such
as
an
impermissible
remedial
measure?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
argument
then
come
down
in
light
of
what
you
said
to
proposition
that
judge
mcmillan
abused
his
discretion
in
doing
what
he
did?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
solicitor
general,
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
a
reading
of
what
judge
mcmillan
did.
there
is
a
reading
of
what
he
did
and
what
he
said
in
these
opinions
under
which
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
government's
position
for
us
to
affirm
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question,wagonner.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
north
carolina
law,
does
a
child
has
a
right
to
go
to
a
particular
school?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
the
neighborhood
school
under
north
carolina
laws
is
not
a
requirement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
schools
zones
in
discretion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
child
has
no
right
under
north
carolina
law,
it
will
go
other--
that
where
under
the
board
plans,
supposed
to
go.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
they
offered
their
plan
that
the
issue
along
number
four
as
submitted.
