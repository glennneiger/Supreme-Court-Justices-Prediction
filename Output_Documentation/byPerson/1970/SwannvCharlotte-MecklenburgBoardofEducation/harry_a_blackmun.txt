how

had
the
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
chambers,
let
me
bring
you
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
inquiry
as
to
your
definition
of
a
racially
identifiable
school,
do
i
understand
from
your
question
that
under
no
circumstances
in
a
unitized
system,
could
a
school
be
beyond
the
prescribed
racial
balance?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'd
like
you
to
answer
on
a
general
as
a
matter
of
general
principle.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'd
like
to
get
away
from
the
facts
of
this
case
into
a
general
area.
one
other
question,
do
you
draw
any
distinction
between
the
reasonable
test
which
the
fourth
circuit
seemed
to
apply
and
the
feasibility
approach
of
the
district
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
chambers,
what
is
the
situation
there,
do
blacks
object
to
this
plan?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
though
that
the
plan
would
--
under
the
court's
order,
the
plan
wouldn't
let
blacks
opt
out
of
the
plan.
if
they
prefer
to
stay
in
a
black
school,
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
do
so.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
well,
what
if
they
wanted
to
opt
out
of
a
(inaudible)
and
stay
in
their
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what's
your
answer
to
the
arguments
that
you
find
in
the
briefs
that
this
is
just
reversed
discrimination
in
the
sense
that
some
blacks
are
kept
out
of
their
schools
and
sent
to
other
schools
because
they're
black
and
some
whites
are
kept
out
of
schools
because
they're
whites,
sent
to
other
schools
because
they're
white.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what's
your
answer
to
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
it,
(voice
overlap)
--?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
solicitor
general
could
i
ask
you,
let's
assume
a
school
district
or
school
system
where
there
has
not
been
a
dual
system,
and
there
is
no
proof
of
any
official
discrimination
and
pupil
assignments
or
building
schools
or
anything
else.
from
what
you
said
a
while
ago,
i
take
it
that
the
school
board
on
its
own,
well,
and
also
let's
assume
that
in
this
system
there
are
some
all
black
schools
and
some
all
white
schools.
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
that
the
school
board
on
its
own
could
to
achieve
--
you
think
that
to
achieve
educational
goals,
adopt
the
plan
which
would
redraw
attendant
zones,
fare,
bus
in
order
to
make
sure
the
blacks
and
whites
were
going
to
school
together.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
that
was
a
--
even
though
those
assignments
were
made
explicitly
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
now
you
would
say
the
constitution
permits
the
board
to
do
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
i
take
it
however
much
you
said
that
a
while
ago
about
the
necessity
or
a
state
action
and
discrimination
that
absent
that,
their
constitution
wouldn't
require
the
board
to
do
that,
in
a
zone,
in
a
district
like
i
described.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
i
take
it
that
your
argument
is
that
in
the
charlotte
case,
and
in
the
mobile
case,
it's
the
necessity
to
disestablish,
the
necessity
to
provide
an
adequate
remedy
for
official
discrimination
that
would
permit
or
that
is
the
basis
for
saying
the
constitution
requires
gerrymandering
zones,
pairing,
busing
or
any
of
these
other
devices
to
make
sure
that
blacks
and
whites
are
going
to
school
together.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
well,
i
understand
but
whatever
they
are,
nevertheless
their
justification,
the
fact
that
the
constitution
requires
them
is
based
on
the
--
or
the
position
that
the
constitution
requires
them
is
that
--
is
based
on
past
official
discretion.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
even
though
and
possibly
in
this
district
like
in
other
districts
across
the
country,
there
might
have
been
all
black
and
all
white
schools
even
though
there
had
never
been
any
official
discrimination.
it's
awfully
hard
to
tell
whether
there
would
have
been
or
not
or
where
they
might
have
been.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
the
county?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
character
in
the
neighborhood
of
some
of
these
schools
have
changed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
government
financed
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
wagonner.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
you
about
your
answer
in
response
to
the
question
about
remedy.
you
draw
no
distinction
between
a
situation
which
has
a
de
jure
background
and
one
which
is
purely
de
facto
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
we
possibly
can
under
the
test
of
reasonableness.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
would
you
stop
a
moment
--
what's
the
paragraph
710-a
that
you
refer?
because
as
i
see
it,
in
paragraph
12,
the
fixed
ratios
of
pupils
in
particular
schools
will
not
be
set
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
the
december
1
order,
710-a.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that's
why
i'm
looking
at
fixed
racial
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
that's
the
one
i
guess.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
say
the
school
board
went
beyond
what
do
you
think
the
constitution
required?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
say
it
went
there
on
its
own
initiative,
or
was
it
told
to
do
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
about
the
department
of
health
education
welfare?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
problem.
justice
