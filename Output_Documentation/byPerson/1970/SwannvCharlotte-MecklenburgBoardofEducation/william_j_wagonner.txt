mr.
william
j.
wagonner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
record
in
this
case
is
voluminous
as
evidenced
by
the
small
portion
of
the
record
that's
been
printed
and
presented
to
the
court.
and
although
the
record
is
substantial,
we
think
that
there
are
some
crucial
issues
which
may
be
simply
stated.
and
the
first
one
is,
is
racial
balance
a
constitutional
imperative?
this
has
been
discussed.
we
think
that
if
racial
balance
is
a
requirement
then
there
is
no
need
to
have
plans.
all
the
school
board
need
do
is
simply
report
to
the
court
we
have
achieved
a
racial
balance.
i
think
it
would
end
the
inquiry
of
the
court
with
reference
to
what
plan,
what
means
you're
using.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
pure
racial
balance,
if
you
went
to
the
limit
of
it,
i
would
say
would
be
that
you
would
have
7129.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
in
each
school
building.
but
i
think
there
are
varying
degrees.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
in
all
of
the
school.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
this
would
be
racial
balance.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
do
not
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
do
not
mean,
no
sir.
my
position
is
that
racial
balance
is
where
a
conscious
effort
is
made
through
extreme
means
to
achieve
the
approximate
racial
balance
in
each
school.
let
me
apply
this
to
the
plan
that
we
have.
the
board
plan
cut
across
district
lines.
the
district
court
accepted
those,
it
produced
a
racial
balance
somewhere
between
15%
and
35%.
he
went
further
and
said,
“this
is
not
enough.
take
these
10
schools,
nine
of
which
were
predominantly
black
and
one
predominantly
white
and
pair
it
with
24
other
schools
so
that
you
get
balance
in
these
schools.”
now,
it's
argued
that
there's
a
range
here
in
the
elementary
level
from
3%
to
41%.
but
you
can
move
out
of
the
44,000
elementary
students.
you
can
move
300
black
students
and
300
white
students,
and
the
range
of
desegregation
in
the
schools
would
be
between
20%
and
35%.
now,
think
at
a
range
of
15%
certainly
is
a
racial
balance.
the
500
students
who
happen
or
300
black
students
who
happen
to
be
in
these
other
schools
could
balance
the
school
system.
this
is
de
minimis
under
anybody's
interpretation
i
think.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
by
his
own
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
feel
this
would
be
at
the
constitutional
obligation
of
the
school
board
to
do
this.
if
it
can
be
accomplished
by
reasonable
means
to
disestablish
a
dual
system
by
gerrymandering
which
the
board
did
to
the
extent
it
could.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
would
be
against
a
dual
school
system
i
would
say.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
may
have
given
that
impression,
my
concept,
well,
my
concept
of
an
elimination,
the
affirmative
duty
is
to
take
the
green
case
in
the
sixth
criteria,
you
eliminated
discrimination
in
faculty,
staff,
activities,
transportation,
the
other
elements.
now
with
reference
to
students,
if
you
assign
children
on
a
non-racial
basis,
based
on
proximity
and
convenience,
then
you
have
accomplished
a
unitary
system
because
you
have
assigned
on
the
basis
of
non-racial.
this
is
what
brown
talks
about.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
perhaps
it
is.
let
me
state
this.
the
board
has
gone
further
than
i
perceive
the
constitutional
duty
to
be.
the
plaintiffs
are
not
objecting
to
it
but
i
think
that
their
only
objection
to
the
board
plan
is
that
we
have
used
racial
assignments.
i
think
that's
the
real
key
because
if
you
look
at
brown,
it
says
arrange
your
school
districts
in
compact
units.
these
certainly
are
not
compact
units
that
brown
spoke
of.
one
thing
i
might
point
out,
if
racial
balance
is
a
constitutional
imperative,
then
it
likewise
becomes
a
constitutional
duty
upon
all
children,
black
or
white
to
attend
a
balanced
school.
if
this
is
a
duty
then
--
is
this
court
to
permit
those
who
were
in
reason
of
wealth
are
able
to
buy
their
ways
out
of
the
public
school
system.
north
carolina
has
20,000
students
in
private
schools.
will
those
students
be
required
to
come
in
to
the
public
school
system
to
discharge
their
public
duty?
will
the
814,000
in
new
york
be
required
to
come
in
to
the
public
school
system?
the
544,000
in
pennsylvania?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
imposed
a
constitutional
duty
upon
each
person
because
of
his
race,
this
is
similar
to
the
old
draft
laws
where
a
person
was
able
to
buy
his
way
out
of
the
draft.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
i
think
the
state
acting
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
child
is
using
the
child
and
the
child
thereby
has
a
duty.
if
you
go
to
racial
balance,
you
are
imposing
a
duty
on
the
child.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
would
think
so.
one
of
them
just
built
a
100
unit
apartment
compound.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
this
but
i
think
that
if
a
duty
is
imposed
on
white
children
and
on
black
children
to
submit
themselves
the
purpose
of
balancing,
that
this
court
certainly
should
not
permit
by
reason
of
wealth,
a
child
to
avoid
the
duty.
this
to
me
is
a
very
real
point
in
this
case.
is
that
the
court
isn't
punishing
a
school
board,
it's
using
children
to
accomplish
constitutional
systems
and
system
is
what
this
court
has
consistently
spoke
of.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
second
one
that
i
would
say
if
it
is
in
the
constitutional
imperative,
then
what
is
a
unitary
system?
we
again
look
at
brown
and
we
look
at
green.
determine
a
non-racial
method
of
assigning
children
to
school,
build
compact
units,
don't
consider
race
in
assignment.
green
says
discharge
the
affirmative
duty.
we
have
discharged
the
affirmative
duty
because
we
have
desegregated
faculties
completely,
racially
percentage
wise.
we
have
no
dual
bus
system
except
that
that
the
district
court
has
introduced.
each
morning,
we
have
black
buses
going
out
and
white
buses
going
in.
so
we
do
have
a
dual
bus
system
but
it's
under
court
order.
so
under
my
interpretation,
it
would
be
a
non-racial
assignment
of
students
based
on
proximity
and
convenience.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
that
it's
unfair.
i'm
just
pointing
that
this
has
been
the
effect.
this
was
one
of
the
evils
of
the
old
dual
system
is
that
you
had
blacks
on
one
group
of
buses
and
whites
on
another.
the
district
court
order
has
done
this.
all
the
junior
high
black
students,
get
on
the
bus
and
go
to
white
schools.
in
the
afternoon,
they
get
on
the
bus
and
they
are
all
black,
and
they
go
back
home.
so
we
do
have
the
earmarks
of
a
dual
bus
system.
but
we're
not
contesting.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir.
we
are
not
challenging
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
are
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
are
not
challenging
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
let
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
let
me
state
it
this
way
if
i
may.
we
do
not
challenge
the
fact
that
the
buses
have
only
black
children
or
white
children
on
it.
but
we
do
object
to
the
fact
that
their
assignment
to
a
school
is
based
on
race.
black
or
white
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it
is,
yes
sir.
there's
no
way
around
it.
alright,
the
third
question
i
would
suggest
is,
does
the
board
plan
offer
a
unitary
system?
we
have
tried
to
compare
ourselves
to
other
systems
in
the
nation
that
did
not
have
the
laws
requiring
separation
of
races
to
see
how
far
they
had
gotten
along.
this
has
been
excluded.
but
nevertheless
in
our
plan,
68%
of
the
black
students
would
be
in
predominantly
white
schools.
32%
would
be
in
predominantly
black
schools.
there
are
103
schools.
there
would
be
both
races
in
attendance
at
a
100
of
these
schools.
now,
this
to
me
certainly
has
earmarks
of
unitary
system.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
is
our
position
and
again
i
will
state
that
if
the
plaintiffs
have
a
complaint,
it
is
that
we
went
too
far
because
we
have
assigned
children
under
the
board
plan
on
account
of
their
race.
now,
the
fourth
question
that
i
would
suggest
is
that
once
a
unitary
system
is
established,
is
there
an
affirmative
duty
to
police
and
maintain
ratios?
now,
assuming
the
district
court's
order,
as
upheld
by
the
court,
do
we
have
a
duty
to
maintain
these
ratios
indefinitely
in
our
schools?
do
we
have
to
continue
busing
for
years
and
years,
and
years?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
is
precisely
what
he
has
ordered.
and
mr.
horack
will
address
himself
to
this
particular
question
in
the
scope
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
may
i
use
this
illustration?
in
our
plan
this
year,
we
were
balanced.
as
of
figures
of
january
31,
when
we
opened
school,
we
have
three
predominantly
black
elementary
schools.
we
have
three
more
that
are
near
black.
we
have
the
junior
high
that's
going
to
be
black,
predominantly
black
before
the
year
is
over.
when
does
a
school
system
get
out
of
the
business
of
balancing?
now
here's
a
pure
at
case
of
racial
balance.
and
here
we
have
seven
schools,
three
of
which
are
already
predominantly
black
and
four
more
to
go.
and
next
year,
what's
going
to
happen?
could
charlotte
become
another
atlanta
where
the
race
is
60%
black,
40%
white?
how
do
you
balance
in
a
system
of
that
kind?
i
think
these
are
very,
very
pertinent
questions
and
the
court
should
give
some
deep
consideration
to
it.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
as
an
example
of
--
in
charlotte
if
i
can
give
the
court
a
little
understanding
of
the
city.
it's
not
like
washington
where
you
have
row
houses.
there
are
neighborhoods,
there
are
vacant
areas,
there's
another
neighborhood,
it's
a
fast
growing
and
has
been
leap
frogging
in
the
growth
of
the
city.
and
one
of
the
schools
called
berryhill
which
is
a
row
school
that
goes
to
the
river
to
the
west.
an
apartment
complex
has
been
built
there.
four,
five
other
apartment
complexes
have
been
built
in
other
schools
in
that
area.
these
aren't
low
rent
housing.
they
are
very
nice
--
it's
a
nice
housing.
as
the
judge
remarked,
it's
nice
to
get
these
people
out
of
the
shot
gun
houses
that
they
used
to
live
in,
the
old-three
room
house.
but
they
are
moving
to
these
nicer
homes
and
if
you
go
in
and
put
a
500
unit
apartment
complex
within
a
school
district,
the
blacks
are
--
most
of
the
public
housing
that
is
being
built
is
being
occupied
by
blacks.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
one
of
the
public
housing
projects
was
built
by
a
black
church
in
charlotte,
with
500
units.
another
one,
a
100
unit
apartment
complex
was
built
by
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
because
they
are
income
requirements
and
the
blacks
buy
and
large
are
the
lower
income
people,
they
are
in
the
poorest
housing
and
it's
just
a
fact
of
life
that
the
blacks
move
in
and
the
whites
don't
move
in.
this
is
something
that
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
whites
have
fairly
well
stayed
in
the
district
but
they
are
simply
over
populated.
if
you
have
a
school
of
600
and
you
have
it
with
a
ratio
of
400
to
200,
you
move
200
blocks
in
and
you're
50/50.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
it's
occurring.
they're
moving
to
the
suburban
areas
but
it
may
very
well
be
that
adjoining
counties
will
begin
receiving
the
white
population
of
charlotte,
i
don't
know,
there
is
some
small
tendency
along
that
line.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well
it
may
be
the
blacks
will
not
go
to
those
counties.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
blacks
have
historically
stayed
in
the
center
city
where
transportation
and
jobs
are
usually
available.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
in
another
question
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
government
financed
it.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
have
no
objection
as
long
as
they
do
it
voluntarily.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
constitution
does
not
require
this.
that's
my
position.
as
long
as
they
consent
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
there
is
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
elected
officials
could
go
that
far.
i
don't
believe
a
court
can.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
now,
there
are
several
misconceptions
about
the
facts
of
this
case
that
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
courts'
attention.
i've
already
alluded
to
the
fact
that
we
have
promised
great
desegregation
under
the
board's
plan.
there
has
been
a
tendency
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
also
the
plaintiffs
and
petitioners
in
this
case
to
suggest
that
the
racial
ratios
of
69:70
is
what
the
board
plan
produced,
where
we
had
17
predominantly
black
schools,
5
predominantly
black
junior
highs
and
one
predominantly
black
senior
high.
but
that
is
not
what
the
board
is
here
urging
this
court
to
approve
as
desegregation
plan.
as
our
68%
of
the
blacks
who
are
in
the
desegregated
schools.
another
one
is
that
and
we
have
been
continually
unable
to
clear
up
the
question
of
the
instructions
that
we
gave
to
the
computer.
we
asked
one
extension
of
time
and
judge
mcmillan
asked
us,
what
are
the
instructions
that
have
been
given
to
the
computer
and
we
responded
that
we
will
not
--
the
computer
will
not
make
any
assignments
unless
there
--
if
there
are
more
than
40%
black
students
in
a
student
body.
the
reason
for
this
was
to
gain
stability.
this
school
board
wants
to
get
out
of
the
courts
and
get
on
with
educating
children
and
if
we
could
build
a
more
stable
desegregation
plan,
this
was
our
goal.
when
the
plan
was
finally
put
together
of
necessity,
whites
were
assigned
to
minority
situations
in
all
of
the
black
schools,
ranging
from
a
handful
to
17%.
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
we
only
bus
514
blacks
to
all
black
schools.
may
i
ask
the
court
to
catch
the
connotation
of
all
black
schools?
what
about
all
the
blacks
that
live
in
the
county
that
go
to
desegregated
schools?
they
receive
transportation.
we
are
told
that
we
place
schools
so
that
they
would
be
handed
to
whites
--
i
mean
handed
to
blacks
and
we
bus
whites
to
the
predominantly
black
school,
i
mean
white
schools.
the
court
lists
eight
schools
that
has
96
children
live
around
these
schools.
the
court
will
look,
these
were
county
schools,
all
of
them
having
varying
degrees
of
desegregation.
alexander
has
30%
black,
east
mecklenburg
10%,
north
mecklenburg
28%,
and
olympic
41%.
these
blacks
have
bused
to
schools
where
there
are
only
96
people
living
around
these
eight
schools.
so
we
ask
the
court
to
not
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
statement
that
only
541
students
are
bused
to
black
schools.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
favor
neither.
i
don't
favor
the
district
court
because
he
uses
racial
assignment.
i
don't
favor
the
court
of
appeals,
only
secondary
level,
junior
and
senior
high
because
there
he
used
racial
assignment.
and
if
you
look
at
the
senior
high
plan
that
he
adopted,
there
was
no
predominantly
black
school.
the
highest
percentage
the
board
proposed
was
36%
but
the
judge
told
us
to
pick
up
300
blacks
out
of
these
two
schools
and
bus
some
way
out
here
to
the
south
eastern
corner
of
the
county.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
would
estimate
about
12
to
15
miles.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
would
tend
to
assure
stability.
it
was
a
school
that
had
2%
black
students
but
what
for
is
something
that
we
have
questioned
repeatedly
ourselves.
but
it's
racial
balance
i
think
this
is
clearly
evident
that
is
racial
balance.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir
they
do
not.
it's
a
large
rural
area.
20
years
ago,
a
number
of
blacks
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it
was
substantially
achieved,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
favor
as
an
alternate
and
something
that's
workable,
something
that's
understandable.
the
same
thing
that
was
argued
in
brown.
the
same
thing
that
was
argued
in
cooper
against
aaron,
the
same
thing
that
was
argued
in
green.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
you
assign
children
to
school
on
non-racial
grounds.
the
criteria
for
assignment
are
proximity
and
convenience
of
students
to
the
school.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
i
acknowledge
and
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
am
supporting
the
board's
plan
as
an
alternative
to
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
did
this.
but
the
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
it
is
not
constitutional
and
if
these
plaintiffs
wanted
to
race
it,
they
could
tell
us
that
we
have
used
racial
criteria
in
making
assignments
when
brown
has
told
us,
no
racial
assignments.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
the
board
has
disregarded
its
attorney's
advice.[laughter]
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
disestablishment
that
i
see,
comes
in
the
first
five
factors
over
which
we
have
control
of
the
green
checklist,
faculties,
teachers
don't
have
to
teach
but
students
have
to
go
to
school.
so
i
think
that
you
can
make
faculty
racial
assignments
because
teachers
does
not
have
to
teach.
but
under
compulsory
assignment,
the
students
has
to
go
to
school.
his
parents
can
be
jailed
if
he
doesn't.
transportation,
we
have
eliminated.
staff,
we
have
eliminated.
facilities,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
facilities
and
other
activities.
there's
no
discrimination
there.
so
this
gets
you
down.
you
discharge
the
affirmative
duty
with
the
first
five
items
of
the
green
checklist.
and
then
with
students
as
brown
commands
you
assign
students
on
non-racial
grounds,
non-racial
basis.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
now,
one
thing
that
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
he
has
no
right.
it's
an
untrammeled
discretion
of
the
board
of
education.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
but
i
think
under
even
north
carolina
law
or
constitutional
law,
the
child
has
a
right
to
go
to
a
school
on
grounds
other
than
race
or
be
assigned
on
grounds
other
than
race.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it's
a
historical
pattern
of
the
charlotte
system
that
schools
were
attempted
to
be
built
within
three
quarters
of
a
mile
of
a
child.
now
think
if
you
looked
at
our
elementary
attendance
map
which
is
number
two,
which
shows
location
of
schools,
this
has
been
accomplished
in
large
part.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir
i
had,
well
not
of
tender
age,
i
had
a
boy
in
the
seventh
grade.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
were
busing
children
of
tender
age.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
were
bused
to
get
them
to
school.
now
this
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
go
to
the
nearest
school
ordinarily.
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
there
are
no
colored
schools
in
charlotte.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i'll
say
this.
before
1965,
there
were
still
some
vestiges
of
the
old
state
dual
system.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
admit
that
we
were
a
dual
system
and
we
bused
children
to
get
to
school.
we
bused
white
children
to
pass
black
schools
and
black
children
pass
to
white
school.
this
is
uncontroverted.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
including
children
of
tender
age
whatever
their
age.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
do
two
wrongs
make
a
right?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
so.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
it
is.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it's
achieved
constitutionally,
any
child
who
wishes
to
get
out
of
the
ghetto,
simply
makes
application
to
the
school
for
transportation
and
it's
furnished
free.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
if
this
is
voluntary,
that
the
child
makes
that
election
to
improve
himself,
he
doesn't
require
others
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
no,
this
is
not
the
problem.
we
can
furnish
transportation
to
any
student
where
his
race
is
in
a
majority
to
a
school
where
his
race
is
in
the
minority.
this
is
the
feature
of
our
plan
that
gets
around
or
answers
the
effectively
excluded
portion
of
alexander.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it's
a
racial
assignment
but
it's
voluntary.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
and
a
white
child
can't
transfer
--
a
negro
child
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
that
it
is
because
this
is
voluntary.
you're
not
trading
on
the
rights
of
somebody
else
to
vindicate
your
own
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
you
are
making.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
that
is
permissible.
it's
been
suggested,
i
think
green
suggest
this,
not
in
this
context.
it
says
that
freedom
of
choice
is
used,
it
must
work.
so
here
is
one
that
works.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
there
is
no
distinction
and
this
is
something
that
time
hasn't
permitted
us
to
fully
controvert
on
the
very
shallow
finding
of
the
district
court
permitted
the
same
leeway
that
he
assumed.
i
can
find
the
jury
segregation
in
any
community
in
this
nation.
this
is
a
sincere
feeling
that
i
have.
let
me
give
you
one
example
of
the
shallowness
of
his
findings
and
said,
by
the
use
of
racial
restrictive
covenants,
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
when
it
was
over
the
district
court,
it
was
a
north
carolina
case
--north
carolina
supreme
court
case
involving
charlotte,
involving
the
community
called
chantelle.
there,
the
supreme
court
says,
“there
is
no
uniform
scheme
of
development.”
therefore,
there
are
no
restrictions
imposed
against
this
property.
but
because
of
the
provision
in
the
contract
against
sale
to
members
of
the
black
race,
that
part
of
the
contract
will
be
imposed.
chantelle
is
a
school
that
was
predominantly
white
in
1968-69.
we
gerrymandered
it
and
brought
in
children
from
the
old
(inaudible)
school.
and
now
it's
desegregated.
it's
not
the
paired.
but
my
point
is,
the
evidence
before
the
district
court
showed
on
its
face
that
there
were
no
residential
or
racial
restrictive
covenants
of
uniform
application
on
that
property,
right
in
the
city
of
charlotte.
i
have
hoped
in
the
time
that
i
was
here
to
point
out
the
various
aspects
of
the
plans.
there
is
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
do
and
addressing
myself
to
brief
the
solicitor
general.
on
page
25
of
their
brief,
they
suggest
that
we
should
consider
changing
the
great
structure.
there
was
substantial
evidence
developed
in
the
record
that
charlotte
-
mecklenburg,
is
moving
to
an
unrated
lower
school
grades.
this
permits
students
to
move
according
to
their
ability
within
a
homogeneous
group.
the
next
they
say,
permits
students
to
transfer
from
a
school
in
which
their
race
is
in
the
majority,
the
one
which
is
in
the
minority.
the
courts
below
in
adapting
this
technique
also
required
that
such
students
be
provided
transportation.
the
board
offered
transportation.
this
has
been
governed.
charlotte
has
done
this
and
it
is
opted
under
its
board
plan.
they
say
closed
unneeded
or
substandard
schools.
since
1965,
we've
closed
and
consolidated
20
schools.
is
this
no
action?
is
this
a
recalcitrant
school
board
not
exercising
any
affirmative
duty.
drawing
what
the
zone
lands
--
so
they
cut
across
racially
impacted
residential
areas
instead
of
encircling?
what
do
you
do
when
you
gerrymander
with
a
computer
that
doesn't
know
where
a
highway
or
a
creek
or
a
railroad
is.
we've
cut
across
these
zones.
as
they
plan
new
construction
of
school
facilities
so
as
to
serve
the
students
of
both
races.
this
we
can
recognize
as
being
something
that
can
be
handled
in
a
boarder
zone
between
black
and
white
areas.
i
read
in
the
paper
that
a
480
acres
golf
course,
affluent
neighborhood
is
going
to
be
built.
probably
some
400
to
500
homes
will
go
in
there.
this
is
located
near
the
end
of
the
county,
southern
end
of
the
county.
how
do
we
build
a
school
that
will
serve
those
students
and
also
be
desegregated.
this
is
an
enigma,
the
courts
are
going
to
have
to
face
one
of
these
days.
how
do
you
build
a
school
when
there's
a
vast
separation
between
a
large
group
of
people
of
one
race
and
a
large
group
of
another?
this
is
something
that
is
going
to
be
an
impossibility
and
i
think
the
court
needs
to
consider
this
in
considering
racial
balance
because
if
you
go
to
racial
balance,
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
more
transportation.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
record
in
this
case
is
voluminous
as
evidenced
by
the
small
portion
of
the
record
that's
been
printed
and
presented
to
the
court.
and
although
the
record
is
substantial,
we
think
that
there
are
some
crucial
issues
which
may
be
simply
stated.
and
the
first
one
is,
is
racial
balance
a
constitutional
imperative?
this
has
been
discussed.
we
think
that
if
racial
balance
is
a
requirement
then
there
is
no
need
to
have
plans.
all
the
school
board
need
do
is
simply
report
to
the
court
we
have
achieved
a
racial
balance.
i
think
it
would
end
the
inquiry
of
the
court
with
reference
to
what
plan,
what
means
you're
using.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
pure
racial
balance,
if
you
went
to
the
limit
of
it,
i
would
say
would
be
that
you
would
have
7129.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
in
each
school
building.
but
i
think
there
are
varying
degrees.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
in
all
of
the
school.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
this
would
be
racial
balance.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
do
not
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
do
not
mean,
no
sir.
my
position
is
that
racial
balance
is
where
a
conscious
effort
is
made
through
extreme
means
to
achieve
the
approximate
racial
balance
in
each
school.
let
me
apply
this
to
the
plan
that
we
have.
the
board
plan
cut
across
district
lines.
the
district
court
accepted
those,
it
produced
a
racial
balance
somewhere
between
15%
and
35%.
he
went
further
and
said,
“this
is
not
enough.
take
these
10
schools,
nine
of
which
were
predominantly
black
and
one
predominantly
white
and
pair
it
with
24
other
schools
so
that
you
get
balance
in
these
schools.”
now,
it's
argued
that
there's
a
range
here
in
the
elementary
level
from
3%
to
41%.
but
you
can
move
out
of
the
44,000
elementary
students.
you
can
move
300
black
students
and
300
white
students,
and
the
range
of
desegregation
in
the
schools
would
be
between
20%
and
35%.
now,
think
at
a
range
of
15%
certainly
is
a
racial
balance.
the
500
students
who
happen
or
300
black
students
who
happen
to
be
in
these
other
schools
could
balance
the
school
system.
this
is
de
minimis
under
anybody's
interpretation
i
think.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
by
his
own
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
feel
this
would
be
at
the
constitutional
obligation
of
the
school
board
to
do
this.
if
it
can
be
accomplished
by
reasonable
means
to
disestablish
a
dual
system
by
gerrymandering
which
the
board
did
to
the
extent
it
could.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
would
be
against
a
dual
school
system
i
would
say.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
may
have
given
that
impression,
my
concept,
well,
my
concept
of
an
elimination,
the
affirmative
duty
is
to
take
the
green
case
in
the
sixth
criteria,
you
eliminated
discrimination
in
faculty,
staff,
activities,
transportation,
the
other
elements.
now
with
reference
to
students,
if
you
assign
children
on
a
non-racial
basis,
based
on
proximity
and
convenience,
then
you
have
accomplished
a
unitary
system
because
you
have
assigned
on
the
basis
of
non-racial.
this
is
what
brown
talks
about.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
perhaps
it
is.
let
me
state
this.
the
board
has
gone
further
than
i
perceive
the
constitutional
duty
to
be.
the
plaintiffs
are
not
objecting
to
it
but
i
think
that
their
only
objection
to
the
board
plan
is
that
we
have
used
racial
assignments.
i
think
that's
the
real
key
because
if
you
look
at
brown,
it
says
arrange
your
school
districts
in
compact
units.
these
certainly
are
not
compact
units
that
brown
spoke
of.
one
thing
i
might
point
out,
if
racial
balance
is
a
constitutional
imperative,
then
it
likewise
becomes
a
constitutional
duty
upon
all
children,
black
or
white
to
attend
a
balanced
school.
if
this
is
a
duty
then
--
is
this
court
to
permit
those
who
were
in
reason
of
wealth
are
able
to
buy
their
ways
out
of
the
public
school
system.
north
carolina
has
20,000
students
in
private
schools.
will
those
students
be
required
to
come
in
to
the
public
school
system
to
discharge
their
public
duty?
will
the
814,000
in
new
york
be
required
to
come
in
to
the
public
school
system?
the
544,000
in
pennsylvania?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
imposed
a
constitutional
duty
upon
each
person
because
of
his
race,
this
is
similar
to
the
old
draft
laws
where
a
person
was
able
to
buy
his
way
out
of
the
draft.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
i
think
the
state
acting
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
child
is
using
the
child
and
the
child
thereby
has
a
duty.
if
you
go
to
racial
balance,
you
are
imposing
a
duty
on
the
child.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
would
think
so.
one
of
them
just
built
a
100
unit
apartment
compound.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
this
but
i
think
that
if
a
duty
is
imposed
on
white
children
and
on
black
children
to
submit
themselves
the
purpose
of
balancing,
that
this
court
certainly
should
not
permit
by
reason
of
wealth,
a
child
to
avoid
the
duty.
this
to
me
is
a
very
real
point
in
this
case.
is
that
the
court
isn't
punishing
a
school
board,
it's
using
children
to
accomplish
constitutional
systems
and
system
is
what
this
court
has
consistently
spoke
of.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
second
one
that
i
would
say
if
it
is
in
the
constitutional
imperative,
then
what
is
a
unitary
system?
we
again
look
at
brown
and
we
look
at
green.
determine
a
non-racial
method
of
assigning
children
to
school,
build
compact
units,
don't
consider
race
in
assignment.
green
says
discharge
the
affirmative
duty.
we
have
discharged
the
affirmative
duty
because
we
have
desegregated
faculties
completely,
racially
percentage
wise.
we
have
no
dual
bus
system
except
that
that
the
district
court
has
introduced.
each
morning,
we
have
black
buses
going
out
and
white
buses
going
in.
so
we
do
have
a
dual
bus
system
but
it's
under
court
order.
so
under
my
interpretation,
it
would
be
a
non-racial
assignment
of
students
based
on
proximity
and
convenience.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
that
it's
unfair.
i'm
just
pointing
that
this
has
been
the
effect.
this
was
one
of
the
evils
of
the
old
dual
system
is
that
you
had
blacks
on
one
group
of
buses
and
whites
on
another.
the
district
court
order
has
done
this.
all
the
junior
high
black
students,
get
on
the
bus
and
go
to
white
schools.
in
the
afternoon,
they
get
on
the
bus
and
they
are
all
black,
and
they
go
back
home.
so
we
do
have
the
earmarks
of
a
dual
bus
system.
but
we're
not
contesting.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir.
we
are
not
challenging
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
are
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
are
not
challenging
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
let
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
let
me
state
it
this
way
if
i
may.
we
do
not
challenge
the
fact
that
the
buses
have
only
black
children
or
white
children
on
it.
but
we
do
object
to
the
fact
that
their
assignment
to
a
school
is
based
on
race.
black
or
white
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it
is,
yes
sir.
there's
no
way
around
it.
alright,
the
third
question
i
would
suggest
is,
does
the
board
plan
offer
a
unitary
system?
we
have
tried
to
compare
ourselves
to
other
systems
in
the
nation
that
did
not
have
the
laws
requiring
separation
of
races
to
see
how
far
they
had
gotten
along.
this
has
been
excluded.
but
nevertheless
in
our
plan,
68%
of
the
black
students
would
be
in
predominantly
white
schools.
32%
would
be
in
predominantly
black
schools.
there
are
103
schools.
there
would
be
both
races
in
attendance
at
a
100
of
these
schools.
now,
this
to
me
certainly
has
earmarks
of
unitary
system.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
is
our
position
and
again
i
will
state
that
if
the
plaintiffs
have
a
complaint,
it
is
that
we
went
too
far
because
we
have
assigned
children
under
the
board
plan
on
account
of
their
race.
now,
the
fourth
question
that
i
would
suggest
is
that
once
a
unitary
system
is
established,
is
there
an
affirmative
duty
to
police
and
maintain
ratios?
now,
assuming
the
district
court's
order,
as
upheld
by
the
court,
do
we
have
a
duty
to
maintain
these
ratios
indefinitely
in
our
schools?
do
we
have
to
continue
busing
for
years
and
years,
and
years?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
is
precisely
what
he
has
ordered.
and
mr.
horack
will
address
himself
to
this
particular
question
in
the
scope
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
may
i
use
this
illustration?
in
our
plan
this
year,
we
were
balanced.
as
of
figures
of
january
31,
when
we
opened
school,
we
have
three
predominantly
black
elementary
schools.
we
have
three
more
that
are
near
black.
we
have
the
junior
high
that's
going
to
be
black,
predominantly
black
before
the
year
is
over.
when
does
a
school
system
get
out
of
the
business
of
balancing?
now
here's
a
pure
at
case
of
racial
balance.
and
here
we
have
seven
schools,
three
of
which
are
already
predominantly
black
and
four
more
to
go.
and
next
year,
what's
going
to
happen?
could
charlotte
become
another
atlanta
where
the
race
is
60%
black,
40%
white?
how
do
you
balance
in
a
system
of
that
kind?
i
think
these
are
very,
very
pertinent
questions
and
the
court
should
give
some
deep
consideration
to
it.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
as
an
example
of
--
in
charlotte
if
i
can
give
the
court
a
little
understanding
of
the
city.
it's
not
like
washington
where
you
have
row
houses.
there
are
neighborhoods,
there
are
vacant
areas,
there's
another
neighborhood,
it's
a
fast
growing
and
has
been
leap
frogging
in
the
growth
of
the
city.
and
one
of
the
schools
called
berryhill
which
is
a
row
school
that
goes
to
the
river
to
the
west.
an
apartment
complex
has
been
built
there.
four,
five
other
apartment
complexes
have
been
built
in
other
schools
in
that
area.
these
aren't
low
rent
housing.
they
are
very
nice
--
it's
a
nice
housing.
as
the
judge
remarked,
it's
nice
to
get
these
people
out
of
the
shot
gun
houses
that
they
used
to
live
in,
the
old-three
room
house.
but
they
are
moving
to
these
nicer
homes
and
if
you
go
in
and
put
a
500
unit
apartment
complex
within
a
school
district,
the
blacks
are
--
most
of
the
public
housing
that
is
being
built
is
being
occupied
by
blacks.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
one
of
the
public
housing
projects
was
built
by
a
black
church
in
charlotte,
with
500
units.
another
one,
a
100
unit
apartment
complex
was
built
by
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
because
they
are
income
requirements
and
the
blacks
buy
and
large
are
the
lower
income
people,
they
are
in
the
poorest
housing
and
it's
just
a
fact
of
life
that
the
blacks
move
in
and
the
whites
don't
move
in.
this
is
something
that
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
whites
have
fairly
well
stayed
in
the
district
but
they
are
simply
over
populated.
if
you
have
a
school
of
600
and
you
have
it
with
a
ratio
of
400
to
200,
you
move
200
blocks
in
and
you're
50/50.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
it's
occurring.
they're
moving
to
the
suburban
areas
but
it
may
very
well
be
that
adjoining
counties
will
begin
receiving
the
white
population
of
charlotte,
i
don't
know,
there
is
some
small
tendency
along
that
line.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well
it
may
be
the
blacks
will
not
go
to
those
counties.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
blacks
have
historically
stayed
in
the
center
city
where
transportation
and
jobs
are
usually
available.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
in
another
question
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
government
financed
it.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
have
no
objection
as
long
as
they
do
it
voluntarily.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
constitution
does
not
require
this.
that's
my
position.
as
long
as
they
consent
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
there
is
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
elected
officials
could
go
that
far.
i
don't
believe
a
court
can.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
now,
there
are
several
misconceptions
about
the
facts
of
this
case
that
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
courts'
attention.
i've
already
alluded
to
the
fact
that
we
have
promised
great
desegregation
under
the
board's
plan.
there
has
been
a
tendency
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
also
the
plaintiffs
and
petitioners
in
this
case
to
suggest
that
the
racial
ratios
of
69:70
is
what
the
board
plan
produced,
where
we
had
17
predominantly
black
schools,
5
predominantly
black
junior
highs
and
one
predominantly
black
senior
high.
but
that
is
not
what
the
board
is
here
urging
this
court
to
approve
as
desegregation
plan.
as
our
68%
of
the
blacks
who
are
in
the
desegregated
schools.
another
one
is
that
and
we
have
been
continually
unable
to
clear
up
the
question
of
the
instructions
that
we
gave
to
the
computer.
we
asked
one
extension
of
time
and
judge
mcmillan
asked
us,
what
are
the
instructions
that
have
been
given
to
the
computer
and
we
responded
that
we
will
not
--
the
computer
will
not
make
any
assignments
unless
there
--
if
there
are
more
than
40%
black
students
in
a
student
body.
the
reason
for
this
was
to
gain
stability.
this
school
board
wants
to
get
out
of
the
courts
and
get
on
with
educating
children
and
if
we
could
build
a
more
stable
desegregation
plan,
this
was
our
goal.
when
the
plan
was
finally
put
together
of
necessity,
whites
were
assigned
to
minority
situations
in
all
of
the
black
schools,
ranging
from
a
handful
to
17%.
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
we
only
bus
514
blacks
to
all
black
schools.
may
i
ask
the
court
to
catch
the
connotation
of
all
black
schools?
what
about
all
the
blacks
that
live
in
the
county
that
go
to
desegregated
schools?
they
receive
transportation.
we
are
told
that
we
place
schools
so
that
they
would
be
handed
to
whites
--
i
mean
handed
to
blacks
and
we
bus
whites
to
the
predominantly
black
school,
i
mean
white
schools.
the
court
lists
eight
schools
that
has
96
children
live
around
these
schools.
the
court
will
look,
these
were
county
schools,
all
of
them
having
varying
degrees
of
desegregation.
alexander
has
30%
black,
east
mecklenburg
10%,
north
mecklenburg
28%,
and
olympic
41%.
these
blacks
have
bused
to
schools
where
there
are
only
96
people
living
around
these
eight
schools.
so
we
ask
the
court
to
not
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
statement
that
only
541
students
are
bused
to
black
schools.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
favor
neither.
i
don't
favor
the
district
court
because
he
uses
racial
assignment.
i
don't
favor
the
court
of
appeals,
only
secondary
level,
junior
and
senior
high
because
there
he
used
racial
assignment.
and
if
you
look
at
the
senior
high
plan
that
he
adopted,
there
was
no
predominantly
black
school.
the
highest
percentage
the
board
proposed
was
36%
but
the
judge
told
us
to
pick
up
300
blacks
out
of
these
two
schools
and
bus
some
way
out
here
to
the
south
eastern
corner
of
the
county.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
would
estimate
about
12
to
15
miles.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
would
tend
to
assure
stability.
it
was
a
school
that
had
2%
black
students
but
what
for
is
something
that
we
have
questioned
repeatedly
ourselves.
but
it's
racial
balance
i
think
this
is
clearly
evident
that
is
racial
balance.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir
they
do
not.
it's
a
large
rural
area.
20
years
ago,
a
number
of
blacks
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it
was
substantially
achieved,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
favor
as
an
alternate
and
something
that's
workable,
something
that's
understandable.
the
same
thing
that
was
argued
in
brown.
the
same
thing
that
was
argued
in
cooper
against
aaron,
the
same
thing
that
was
argued
in
green.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
you
assign
children
to
school
on
non-racial
grounds.
the
criteria
for
assignment
are
proximity
and
convenience
of
students
to
the
school.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
this
i
acknowledge
and
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
am
supporting
the
board's
plan
as
an
alternative
to
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
did
this.
but
the
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
it
is
not
constitutional
and
if
these
plaintiffs
wanted
to
race
it,
they
could
tell
us
that
we
have
used
racial
criteria
in
making
assignments
when
brown
has
told
us,
no
racial
assignments.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
the
board
has
disregarded
its
attorney's
advice.[laughter]
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
the
disestablishment
that
i
see,
comes
in
the
first
five
factors
over
which
we
have
control
of
the
green
checklist,
faculties,
teachers
don't
have
to
teach
but
students
have
to
go
to
school.
so
i
think
that
you
can
make
faculty
racial
assignments
because
teachers
does
not
have
to
teach.
but
under
compulsory
assignment,
the
students
has
to
go
to
school.
his
parents
can
be
jailed
if
he
doesn't.
transportation,
we
have
eliminated.
staff,
we
have
eliminated.
facilities,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
facilities
and
other
activities.
there's
no
discrimination
there.
so
this
gets
you
down.
you
discharge
the
affirmative
duty
with
the
first
five
items
of
the
green
checklist.
and
then
with
students
as
brown
commands
you
assign
students
on
non-racial
grounds,
non-racial
basis.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
now,
one
thing
that
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
he
has
no
right.
it's
an
untrammeled
discretion
of
the
board
of
education.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
but
i
think
under
even
north
carolina
law
or
constitutional
law,
the
child
has
a
right
to
go
to
a
school
on
grounds
other
than
race
or
be
assigned
on
grounds
other
than
race.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it's
a
historical
pattern
of
the
charlotte
system
that
schools
were
attempted
to
be
built
within
three
quarters
of
a
mile
of
a
child.
now
think
if
you
looked
at
our
elementary
attendance
map
which
is
number
two,
which
shows
location
of
schools,
this
has
been
accomplished
in
large
part.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir
i
had,
well
not
of
tender
age,
i
had
a
boy
in
the
seventh
grade.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
were
busing
children
of
tender
age.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
no
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
were
bused
to
get
them
to
school.
now
this
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
they
go
to
the
nearest
school
ordinarily.
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
there
are
no
colored
schools
in
charlotte.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i'll
say
this.
before
1965,
there
were
still
some
vestiges
of
the
old
state
dual
system.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
we
admit
that
we
were
a
dual
system
and
we
bused
children
to
get
to
school.
we
bused
white
children
to
pass
black
schools
and
black
children
pass
to
white
school.
this
is
uncontroverted.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
including
children
of
tender
age
whatever
their
age.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
do
two
wrongs
make
a
right?
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
so.
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
it
is.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it's
achieved
constitutionally,
any
child
who
wishes
to
get
out
of
the
ghetto,
simply
makes
application
to
the
school
for
transportation
and
it's
furnished
free.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
if
this
is
voluntary,
that
the
child
makes
that
election
to
improve
himself,
he
doesn't
require
others
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
well,
no,
this
is
not
the
problem.
we
can
furnish
transportation
to
any
student
where
his
race
is
in
a
majority
to
a
school
where
his
race
is
in
the
minority.
this
is
the
feature
of
our
plan
that
gets
around
or
answers
the
effectively
excluded
portion
of
alexander.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
it's
a
racial
assignment
but
it's
voluntary.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
and
a
white
child
can't
transfer
--
a
negro
child
--
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
that
it
is
because
this
is
voluntary.
you're
not
trading
on
the
rights
of
somebody
else
to
vindicate
your
own
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
you
are
making.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
i
think
that
is
permissible.
it's
been
suggested,
i
think
green
suggest
this,
not
in
this
context.
it
says
that
freedom
of
choice
is
used,
it
must
work.
so
here
is
one
that
works.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
wagonner
there
is
no
distinction
and
this
is
something
that
time
hasn't
permitted
us
to
fully
controvert
on
the
very
shallow
finding
of
the
district
court
permitted
the
same
leeway
that
he
assumed.
i
can
find
the
jury
segregation
in
any
community
in
this
nation.
this
is
a
sincere
feeling
that
i
have.
let
me
give
you
one
example
of
the
shallowness
of
his
findings
and
said,
by
the
use
of
racial
restrictive
covenants,
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
when
it
was
over
the
district
court,
it
was
a
north
carolina
case
--north
carolina
supreme
court
case
involving
charlotte,
involving
the
community
called
chantelle.
there,
the
supreme
court
says,
“there
is
no
uniform
scheme
of
development.”
therefore,
there
are
no
restrictions
imposed
against
this
property.
but
because
of
the
provision
in
the
contract
against
sale
to
members
of
the
black
race,
that
part
of
the
contract
will
be
imposed.
chantelle
is
a
school
that
was
predominantly
white
in
1968-69.
we
gerrymandered
it
and
brought
in
children
from
the
old
(inaudible)
school.
and
now
it's
desegregated.
it's
not
the
paired.
but
my
point
is,
the
evidence
before
the
district
court
showed
on
its
face
that
there
were
no
residential
or
racial
restrictive
covenants
of
uniform
application
on
that
property,
right
in
the
city
of
charlotte.
i
have
hoped
in
the
time
that
i
was
here
to
point
out
the
various
aspects
of
the
plans.
there
is
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
do
and
addressing
myself
to
brief
the
solicitor
general.
on
page
25
of
their
brief,
they
suggest
that
we
should
consider
changing
the
great
structure.
there
was
substantial
evidence
developed
in
the
record
that
charlotte
-
mecklenburg,
is
moving
to
an
unrated
lower
school
grades.
this
permits
students
to
move
according
to
their
ability
within
a
homogeneous
group.
the
next
they
say,
permits
students
to
transfer
from
a
school
in
which
their
race
is
in
the
majority,
the
one
which
is
in
the
minority.
the
courts
below
in
adapting
this
technique
also
required
that
such
students
be
provided
transportation.
the
board
offered
transportation.
this
has
been
governed.
charlotte
has
done
this
and
it
is
opted
under
its
board
plan.
they
say
closed
unneeded
or
substandard
schools.
since
1965,
we've
closed
and
consolidated
20
schools.
is
this
no
action?
is
this
a
recalcitrant
school
board
not
exercising
any
affirmative
duty.
drawing
what
the
zone
lands
--
so
they
cut
across
racially
impacted
residential
areas
instead
of
encircling?
what
do
you
do
when
you
gerrymander
with
a
computer
that
doesn't
know
where
a
highway
or
a
creek
or
a
railroad
is.
we've
cut
across
these
zones.
as
they
plan
new
construction
of
school
facilities
so
as
to
serve
the
students
of
both
races.
this
we
can
recognize
as
being
something
that
can
be
handled
in
a
boarder
zone
between
black
and
white
areas.
i
read
in
the
paper
that
a
480
acres
golf
course,
affluent
neighborhood
is
going
to
be
built.
probably
some
400
to
500
homes
will
go
in
there.
this
is
located
near
the
end
of
the
county,
southern
end
of
the
county.
how
do
we
build
a
school
that
will
serve
those
students
and
also
be
desegregated.
this
is
an
enigma,
the
courts
are
going
to
have
to
face
one
of
these
days.
how
do
you
build
a
school
when
there's
a
vast
separation
between
a
large
group
of
people
of
one
race
and
a
large
group
of
another?
this
is
something
that
is
going
to
be
an
impossibility
and
i
think
the
court
needs
to
consider
this
in
considering
racial
balance
because
if
you
go
to
racial
balance,
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
more
transportation.
