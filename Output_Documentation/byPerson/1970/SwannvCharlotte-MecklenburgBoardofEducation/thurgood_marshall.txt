justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
mind
defining
a
satellite.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
maximum
mileage?
pupils
who
were
transported
in
buses,
(inaudible)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
what
is
the
maximum?
justice
thurgood
marshall
three-and-a-half
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
mileage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
90
miles
or
something
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
three
hours.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
maximum
mileage
under
the
recent
order
of
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
maximum
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
cluster,
i'm
just
talking
about
under
this
order,
under
the
operations
of
a
school
before
this
order
was
entered,
do
you
have
the
maximum
mileage
in
miles
and
not
in
hours?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
in
the
mileage,
maximum
mileage
in
the
old
order
and
in
this
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
point
of
the
most
interest
would
be
the
maximum
mileage
rather
than
the
average
mileage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
as
i
understand
that
your
position
is
that
to
put
your
views
in
effect,
the
court
would
have
to
hold
that
the
constitution
requires
busing
under
certain
facts,
and
that
the
state
can
be
compelled
to
buy
buses,
to
do
that
busing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
all
of
that
means
--
i'm
talking
about
the
concrete
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
other
words
the
courts
could
order
states
to
buy
a
large
number
of
buses
in
order
to
transport
pupils
and
but
be
required
to
do
so
by
the
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
all
the
abstract
generalities
about
necessary.
the
question
i'm
interested
in
is,
maybe
it
does
at
this
time.
whether
to
carry
out
your
view,
what
constitution
compels
a
court,
the
united
states
can
require
schools
and
states
to
buy
large
numbers
of
buses,
that
tremendous
expense
to
the
state
in
order
to
transport
pupils.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
particular
case,
how
many
extra
buses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
money
was
available?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
you
get
136
buses
without
any
outlay
of
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
schools
in
north
carolina
should
conclude
to
do
away
with
busing
entirely
have
none
in
the
state
for
the
school,
is
it
your
argument
or
your
view
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i'm
just
talking
about
the
legislature
or
a
state
passing
a
law
to
that
effect.
suppose
they
passed
the
law,
abolish
busing,
beside
not
have
busing
in
north
carolina,
could
that
be
an
unconstitutional
level?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it
will
be
acting
on
this
circumstances
that
the
state
didn't
want
to
have
busing
in
the
public
schools,
is
the
question
i
asked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
would
be
our
duty
to
see
whether
their
legislature
had
passed
that
law
solely
for
that
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
agree
though
there
is
no
black
school
and
it's
feasible
or
possible
to
desegregate
it,
that's
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
government
ought
to
have
housing
programs,
anything
else.
if
the
boards
refuses
to
do
it,
what
is
wrong
with
the
district
court
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
respectfully
submit,
it
might
be
the
duty
to
see
that
each
black
child
gets
a
desegregated
education.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
respectfully
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
agree
that
the
busing
of
the
white
children
in
charlotte
brought
about
desegregated
schools?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
an
individual
right
that
each
child
gets
and
do
you
agree
that
the
school
board
could
do
it,
if
they
wanted
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
court
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
there
any
parties
in
this
suit
rich
enough
to
go
to
private
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
know
if
whether
they
can
afford
it
or
not,
do
you?
with
respect
to
in
this
case?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
the
other
counties
receive
that
white
population
and
the
school
boards,
that
those
other
counties
are
persuaded
to
do
what
charlotte
has
done,
where
would
they
go
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
i
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
reason
i
raised
all
these
questions
is
to
whether
the
people
who
moved
out
or
in
or
anything,
we
got
the
situation
here,
we
are
dealing
with
charlotte
as
it
is
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
under
the
supplementary
power
given
under
the
amendment,
for
the
congress
to
supplement
a
program
to
prevent
discrimination,
congress
could
do
it
but
that
the
courts
cannot.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wagonner,
do
you
have
any
children
of
tender
age
that
rides
to
school
buses
as
of
'69?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
the
charlotte
school
system,
they
were
busing
children
of
tender
age,
weren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
a
segregation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
the
reasons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
the
school
near
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
was
so
far
away
from
the
school,
they
had
to
be
bused.
did
they
ever
pass
by
a
colored
school
on
their
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
before
this
plan
went
into
effect.
when
you
did
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
bus
elementary
school
children
of
tender
age
solely
to
maintain
segregation,
is
that
true
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
children
of
kinder
age.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what's
wrong
with
busing
them
for
the
purpose
of
integrating?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
only
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
sure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
is
this
case
been
in
court
already?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
not
70?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
worry
about
impingement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
referring
to
a
court
of
appeals
opinion
remanding
for
the
board
to
take
certain
action?
is
it
your
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
replied
them
to
taking
in
to
consideration
that
balancing
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
mind

a

justice
thurgood

what

thurgood

three

justice
thurgood

what
is
