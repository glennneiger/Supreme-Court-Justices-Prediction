powell,

the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
if
you
assume
that
historically,
the
state
has
created
a
neighborhood
that
is
segregated.
i'm
a
member
of
that
neighborhood,
i'm
a
black
and
the
school
is
black
and
the
teachers
are
black
and
as
justice
harlan
says
the
duty,
the
constitutional
duty
as
i
understand
is
to
disestablish
the
system
of
segregation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
do
you
go
about
getting
me
the
black
student
in
the
ghetto
who
wants
to
get
out
to
another
school
when
i
haven't
got
the
money
to
pay
the
daily
bus
fare?
how
how
was
that
disestablishment
achieved
constitutionally?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
we're
right
--
they
start
then
with
the
problem
of
busing
them.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
the
question
is
whether
the
board
can
make
an
appraisal
as
to
the
number
of
that
would
be
likely
to
apply
and
these
things
have
to
be
arranged
not
day
to
day
but
year
to
year.
in
order
of
the
number
of
buses
and
so
on
that
would
be
needed
to
transport
the
number
that
would
be
likely
to
want
the
shift,
isn't
that
the
problem?
