mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes.
the
court
please,
i
want
to
open
my
remarks
by
of
hearkening
back
to
a
comment
mr.
solicitor
general
here,
that
there
were
some
doubt
about
whether
the
district
court
had
ordered
that
there
shall
be
no
all
black
school
in
charlotte
mecklenburg.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
on
that
score,
i
refer
you
to
--
i
think
it's
paragraph
five,
i
maybe
near
in
the
paragraph
of
this
february
5th
order,
page
822
(a)
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
a
“in
his
order
that
no
school
be
operated
within
all
black
or
predominantly
black
student
body”
so
i
concede
that
on
that
score,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
that
is
his
order
and
i
suggest
that
we
can
move
from
that
point
without
being
played
by
any
doubts.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
there
be
no
black
school.
if
your
honor
please,
of
course
that
order
as
it
applies
to
the
charlotte
mecklenburg
school
board
plan
of
february
2nd
is
referring
to
the
nine
elementary
schools
and
the
one
junior
high
school,
that
remained
predominantly
black
under
the
board
plan
with
black
ratios
extending
from
83%
to
99%
which
means
that
in
some
of
those
total
of
10
schools,
there
were
up
to
17%
whites.
at
the
one
junior
high,
that
was
90%
black
and
10%
white.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
he
did.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no
sir.
on
the
contrary,
exactly
the
opposite.
it
is
because
of
his
order
in
this
extent.
that
there
was
imposed
on
the
board
what
is
called
the
court
ordered
finger
plan
with
all
its
cross
busing
at
the
elementary
level,
the
so
called
satellite
busing
is
the
junior
high
level
to
get
rid
of
the
one
black
school
and
incidentally
it's
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
junior
high
level,
that
involved
busing
out
2700
black
children
out
to
outlying
suburban
junior
high
school,
busing
2700
because
there
were
758
black
that
made
up
and
90%
of
this
one
junior
high.
and
of
course
the
same
as
true
at
the
senior
high
level
and
that's
already
been
alluded
to
except
that
had
a
different
switch
and
twist
on
it.
you
talk
about
balancing.
it's
there.
it's
there
at
the
elementary
level
with
its
cross
busing
and
satellite
busing
at
the
junior
high.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
if
your
honor,
please,
the
final
order
if
you're
referring
to
the
august
3rd
order,
i
remind
the
court
that
there
were
those
july
hearings
that
were
undertaken
as
result
of
remand.
where
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
on
the
test
of
reimburse
to
and
he
found
his
february
5
order
reasonable.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir,
he
reinstated
it.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir
that's
correct.
that's
in
both
and
there
again,
i
would
suggest
to
by
your
honors
if
there's
--
if
there
really
is
any
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
racial
balancing
is
involved
in
this
case.
i
refer
you
to
what
mr.
justice
white
just
alluded
to
and
upon
examination
mr.
justice
white,
you'll
find
several
other
portions
of
the
order
of
similar
import.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
black,
it's
hard
to
define
where
the
twilight
zone
but
you've
got
the
whole
hog
arrangement
where
every
school
in
a
system,
for
instance
charlotte-mecklenburg
has
70:30.
i
mean
that's
the
ultimate.
then
i
think
you
have
racial
balancing
as
the
goal,
the
objective
to
be
achieved.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
racial
balancing
is
a
device
that
has
as
its
objective,
the
proportionizing
of
the
student
bodies.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
whether
they
live
there
or
not
among
the
individual
schools.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
well,
every
school,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
believe
the
concept
of
racial
balancing
can
be
short.
you
can
still
have
something
that
is
properly
designated
as
racial
balancing
that
falls
short
of
the
ultimate.
now
judge
mcmillan,
he
had
and
matter
effect.
he
said,
“i'm
not
racial
balancing.
i
have
no
order
of
racial
balancing.
i'm
merely
directing
racial
diversity”
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it's
a
word
game.
and
so.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
but
what
i
do
suggest
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
give
real,
sincere
application
to
the
court
of
appeals
test
of
reasonableness.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
in
only
that
degree
would
i
put
a
proscriptive
your
honors
own
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
and
if
your
honor,
is
asking
me.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
do
i
think
that
is
the
ultimate
issue?
my
answer
is
yes.
if
your
honor
is
asking
me,
whether
i
think
that
it
is
a
constitutional
imperative,
i
say
no.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
intended
to
address
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
sir?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
throughout
the
session
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
your
honor,
that
is
a
tough
one
and
that's
why
you
asked
it.
i
would
say
no
but
i
want
to
put
–
that
no
the
school
board
could
not
even
within
the
realm
of
its
plenary
powers
and
those
powers
indeed
are
broad.
i
would
put
this
postscript
on
my
response.
as
i
again,
going
to
allude
to
later
but
i'll
now
to
an
extent.
and
you
talked
about
the
rights
of
individual.
be
they
blacks
to
attend
a
desegregated
as
part
of
a
desegregated
system
for
the
reverse
rights
that
mr.
justice
white
referred
to,
of
the
whites
whether
their
rights
are
being
imposed
upon
or
used
as
it
were
and
hence
denied
under
the
equal
protection.
i
think
that
both
of
those
rights
at
the
end
of
the
spectrum
like
almost
any
other
item
of
the
constitution
is
not
a
hard
nosed
absolute.
your
honors
may
recall
that
we
attempted
to
develop
that
thought
which
time
does
not
permit
now
in
detail
in
our
brief.
in
response
to
the
comments
of
judge
sobeloff
and
winters
and
judge
mcmillan
who
views
these
rights
as
absolute,
absolute
rights
to
attend
a
school
with
some
acceptable
mix.
and
that
is
an
individual
right
and
it
cannot
be
taken
away
from
them.
it
cannot
be
denied.
well
to
that
i
say,
as
we
said
in
brief
that
that
right
as
well
as
freedom
of
speech,
and
the
right
to
counsel,
jury
cases
for
all
the
rest
of
it.
they
all
and
this
court
has
recognized
long,
series
of
cases
are
subject
to
an
application
of
reasonable.
now,
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
a
school
board
can
reasonably
go
to
a
point
and
require
racial
balancing
or
maybe
i
would
better
say
that
they
would
have
to
go
to
a
point
that
might
involve
some
mixing.
a
countenance
of
the
races
as
it
were.
but
they
probably
could
not
go
even
on
their
own
inherent
power,
so-called,
plenary
powers.
i
mean,
they
could
not
go
beyond
the
point
where
they
edict
a
racial
balancing
if
that's
the
case.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
it
gets
down
with
a
reason
why
the
differential
was
made,
if
it
were
made
strictly
if
you
would
presume
with
me
for
a
racial
balancing
reason.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
certainly
they
can.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
goes
without
saying
that
school
boards
make
the
differences
such
as
your
honor
suggested
everyday
in
administrating
the
educational
program
for
one
reason
or
another
of
school
system.
so
of
course,
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
you
stated
it
much
better
than
i
did
mr.
justice
black.
with
reference
to
this,
all
black
school
business,
i
would
say
this
that
the
what
is
the
nature
of
the
right
that
let's
say
it's
a
black
child
or
although
it
could
be
of
white,
what
is
his
right
under
the
brown
and
green
decisions?
it's
our
view
that
it
is
not
a
right
to
attend
a
particular
school
of
a
particular
mix.
on
the
contrary,
it
is
the
right
of
a
child
to
go
to
school
in
a
system
where
every
vestige
of
discrimination
has
been
eradicated.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
on
a
count
of
race.
and
that
i
would
agree
therefore,
that
if
a
school
board
undertakes
to
evolve
a
plan
as
indeed
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
one
did,
that
evolve
zones,
evolve
zones
where
the
net
result
and
where
those
lines
ran
at
absolutely
no
racial
bias
to
them
at
all.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
excuse
me,
i
concede
that.
and
it
is
that
phase
of
it
which
your
honor
referred
that
occasions
are
coming
that
our
school
board
plan
of
february
2nd
went
far
beyond
what
the
constitutional
imperative
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
it
did.
i
mean
that
(voice
overlap)
obviously
it
did.
admittedly
it
did
and
it
went
far
beyond
what
we
say
we
were
required
to
do
it.
so
i
say
that
the
right
of
the
child
is
to
be
a
part
of
the
system.
and
hence
that
is
the
opposite
of
what
the
petitioners
contend
for
and
that
is
that
a
child
has
a
right
and
must
eradicate
every
black
school.
i'd
like
to
address
--
sir?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
not
quite,
i
say
your
last
namely
that
duty
of
a
school
board
who
established
a
non
discriminatory
system.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
so
i'm
with
you
on
that
phase
of
it.
there's
other
phase
of
it
is
the
first
part.
i
say
of
course
the,
let's
say
the
black
child
of
this
isn't
true.
he
has
a
constitutional
right
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
the
next
question
is
what
is?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
say
it
is
to
go
to
school
in
a
system
that
where
as
far
as
pupil
assignment
is
concerned,
the
areas
however
devised,
however
arranged
are
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
without
any
racial
balance.
that
is
his
right
to
be
a
part
of
that
system.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
as
far
as
back
to
this
racial
balancing
business,
the
time
is
running
short
but
i
would
commend
to
your
honor's
consideration,
the
following
portions
of
the
district
court
order
if
there's
any
lingering
doubt
that
in
fact
judge
mcmillan
did
prescribe
racial
balancing.
appendix
710-a
to
december
1
order,
the
appendix
822-a
of
the
february
5
order.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
well
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
appendix
710-a,
that's
the
december
1
order
and
that's
where
he
said
that
the
court
will
start
with
the
goal
or
that
there
should
be
idea
of
the
71:29
ratio.
appendix
822-a,
that's
the
february
5
order.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
this
was
the
portion
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
it's
at
paragraph
12
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
well
it
starts
down
there
and
default
of
any
such
plan,
the
court
will
start
with
authority
that
it
advanced
the
order
april
23,
that
effort
should
be
made
to
ratio
to
71:29
ratio.
how
well
i'll
do
on
this
other
paragraph
number,
but
second
is
february
5
order,
appendix
page
822-a.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
the
one
mr.
justice
white
referred
to.
and
the
next
one
which
needs
a
little
emphasis,
that
is
also
in
the
february
5
order,
823-a
wherein
the
court
said
that
the
school
board
shall
maintain
a
continuing
control
over
the
race
of
the
children.
and
then
at
appendix
page
824-a
of
the
february
5
order,
and
again,
shall
adapt
and
implement
a
continuing
program
computerized
or
otherwise
with
assigning
pupils
for
the
conscious
purpose
of
keeping
things
in
a
condition
of
desegregation.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
forever
you
mean?
is
that
your
question?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
chief
justice,
your
idea
about
this
is
good
as
mine,
and
i
have
none.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
think
very
definitely
that
is
what
he
is
saying
to
us
and
i
think
it
portends
rather
grave
problems
as
a
constitutional
matter
and
as
a
practical
matter,
from
here
now.
i
think
judge
mcmillan
basically
will
be
an
ex-official
member
of
our
school
board
for
i
don't
know
how
long.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
this
court
was
instituted
back
in
63,
64,
65.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no
sir,
we
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
marshall,
we're
deeply
concerned
about
the
future.
not
only
acquit
in
full
major
our
constitutional
obligation
and
apart
from
the
constitution
to
fully
acquit
our
sales
to
the
children.
black
and
white
in
our
community,
we
want
to
get
back
to
education.
that's
why
we're
concerned
about
the
future.
we
want
to
bring
this
thing
to
a
(inaudible).
and
we
hope
that
this
--
as
a
result
of
this
case,
we
may
be
enabled
to
do
that.
so
we're
very
much
concerned.
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
think
that,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
school
board
went
to
this
school
board
plan
that
we
say
it
went
beyond
the
constitution
“voluntarily”
under
the
pressure
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
there
was
no
problem
on
that
school.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no
sir.
see,
they
didn't
come
in
to
the
picture
really
until
the
july
hearings.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
the
hew
came
into
the
picture
as
a
result
of
the
court
of
appeals,
may
26
opinion,
when
it
was
remanded
with
the
strong
suggestion,
i
think
it
was
that
the
hew
be
brought
into
the
picture
and
this
is
the
result
of
their
plan.
our
plan,
i
might
add
that
was
shot
down
by
everybody
inside.
i
think
it's
well
known
that
we
have
had
a
badly
divided
board.
and
it's
nine
members,
five
to
four,
and
it
was
–
it's
significant
that
this
was
about
the
first
unanimous
vote
that
they've
had
on
that
board
and
i
don't
know
how
many
years,
unanimous
vote
against
the
hew
plan,
incidentally
for
these
reasons.
number
one,
it
had
a
great
structure
where
for
example,
when
zone
number
four,
there
are
three
elementary
schools,
i
don't
remember
specifics
but
there's
one
group
of
children
that
go
for
grades
one
and
two
here
and
three
and
four
here
and
then
another
one,
and
some
of
the
zones,
the
children
go
to
four
different
elementary
schools
during
the
course
of
their
sick
years
of
elementary
schooling.
that
busing
under
it
was
the
district
court
judge
found
was
about
on
a
par
with
what
his
estimates
were
of
the
finger
plan
and
the
board
minority
plan
and
furthermore
they
came
out
with
ratios
projected
to
50%
to
57%
that
we
knew
they
would
never
stick,
all
in
the
world,
you
would
have
would
be
to
end
up
with
re-segregation
and
in
the
next
place,
they
used
schools
in
these
clusters,
in
this
mixing
process
which
is
another
type
of
racial
balancing,
used
and
employed
schools
that
were
already
desegregated
under
our
school
plan.
well,
that
in
passing
are
the
few
reasons
why
neither
the
district
judge
nor
the
school
board
had
any
tolerance
for
the
hew
plan.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
white,
that's
going
to
be
a
subject
matter
of
the
next
two
cases
and
i
thought
as
we
would
finess.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
let
me
try
my
own
articulation
to
a
question
you
asked
mr.
wagonner.
as
far
as
the
district
court's
order
is
concerned,
we
are
offended
by
it
because
it
says
that
we
can't
have
a
black
school.
it
is
based
upon
racial
balancing
and
it
was
a
court
order
supplanting
of
a
board
plan
that
we
feel
was
thoroughly
constitutional
because
it
was
based
and
established
its
lines
on
completely
non
racial
ground.
now
that
is
why
we
take
offense
at
judge
mcmillan‘s
order.
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
is
concerned,
i
must
digress
to
remind
ourselves
what
did
they
do?
it's
then
the
objective
of
the
district
court
at
all
three
instructional
lesson,
with
elementary,
junior,
and
senior.
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeal
is
concerned,
what
did
they
do?
well,
we
approve
their
rule
or
reason,
simply
because
in
our
view,
in
the
name
of
commonsense,
you
got
to
have
a
rule
or
reason
about
almost
anything.
so,
but
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeal
applied,
misapplied
its
own
rule
in
the
sense
that
it
too
issued
a
ruling
that
was
based
on
the
racial
balancing
for
these
reasons.
what
did
just
court
of
appeals
did
that
the
elementary
level,
they
say
said,
the
school
board
--
you
haven't
done
enough
so
judge
mcmillan,
you've
done
too
much.
there's
too
much
busing
and
transportation
in
this
location
and
so
forth
when
that
super
imposed
upon
the
secondary
level,
junior,
and
senior
high.
so
in
effect,
this
court
of
appeals
found
judge
mcmillan's
elementary
plan
to
be
unreasonable,
you
went
back
took
another
look
at
it
and
found
that
sure
enough,
he
was
reasonable
all
along.
at
the
junior
and
senior
high
school
levels,
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
and
said
yes
that's
not
so
bad.
that's
okay”.
but
in
so
doing
it,
they
approved
the
satellite
busing
and
the
balancing
at
the
junior
high
and
what
is
the
most
glaring
example
already
alluded
to
at
the
senior
high,
they
approved
that.
that's
the
300
black
children
from
the
inner
city
that
bus
1213
miles
out
to
independence
high,
that
under
the
board
plan
had
a
2%
black
population.
it
took
to
300
from
schools
that
we
already
had
it
almost
perfect
mixing
under
the
board
plan.
and
the
only
reason
they
bus
those
300
black
kids
was
to
make
a
white
school
less
white.
so,
really
although
the
smaller
problem,
the
most
glaring
single
example
of
racial
balancing
is
the
senior
high.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
you're
so
right.
yes
you
correctly
state
--
i
was
using
our
approval
for
the
rule
of
reason
there
in
the
sense
that.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
that's
correct.
then
it
also
does
have
a
technical
connotation
in
the
sense
that
in
brief
as
i've
already
mentioned,
we
developed
a
line
of
argument
there
that
says
a
constitutional
right
and
an
individual's
constitutional
right
in
a
multitude
of
areas,
religion,
speech
the
jury
accounts
and
so
on,
is
nevertheless
subject
to,
it
is
not
absolute.
you
can't
run
into
a
building,
crowded
building,
horrified
and
so
forth.
the
counsel
you
know
that
six
months
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
think
the
rule
is
absolute
--
but
i
think
the
rule,
it's
an
absolute
as
a
requirement
but
in
order
as
complex
things
are
in
order
to
accord
that
right
or
protect
that
right.
i
think
you
immediately
thrust
back
into
some
type
of
feasibility
or
rule
of
reason
and
incidentally
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
and
i
think
it's
a
very
--
exact
standard.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
sir.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
perhaps
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
really
and
in
brief
--
where
we're
talking
about
the
cost
of
buses
and
numbers
of
buses,
and
this
location
in
brief
in
particular
what
is
it
involved
with
case
–
mere
distinction
between
where
petty
crimes
leave
off
and
they
have
a
right
to
counsel
--
if
it's
less
than
six
months
you
don't
but
why,
it
goes
for
the
efficient,
expedient
administration
of
justice
which
brings
you
right
into
a
practical
reasonable
feasibility
aspect.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
along
the
line.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
commences
at
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
because
it
is
reasonable.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
the
test
of
reasonableness
as
expounded
by
the
court
of
appeals,
appears
on
appendix
page
12
67-a.
i
don't
have
a
reason
for
this.
see,
what
they
did,
they
vacated
the
judgment
and
remanded
it.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
you're
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals
[voice
overlap]
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
not
specifically.
the
majority
of
the
court
never
admitted
that
they
were
condoning
or
using
racial
balancing.
the
dissenting
judge
who
joined
the
majority
in
order
to
have
a
requisite
vote,
bryan
called
it
like
it
was
and
said,
“you're
talking
terms
of
integration,
but
i'm
telling
that
like
it
is,
it's
really
racial
balancing
you're
doing”
so
you
have
to
read
the
opinion
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
--
.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
where
the
test
of
reasonableness
is
set
forth
by
the
court.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes.
the
court
please,
i
want
to
open
my
remarks
by
of
hearkening
back
to
a
comment
mr.
solicitor
general
here,
that
there
were
some
doubt
about
whether
the
district
court
had
ordered
that
there
shall
be
no
all
black
school
in
charlotte
mecklenburg.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
and
on
that
score,
i
refer
you
to
--
i
think
it's
paragraph
five,
i
maybe
near
in
the
paragraph
of
this
february
5th
order,
page
822
(a)
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
a
“in
his
order
that
no
school
be
operated
within
all
black
or
predominantly
black
student
body”
so
i
concede
that
on
that
score,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
that
is
his
order
and
i
suggest
that
we
can
move
from
that
point
without
being
played
by
any
doubts.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
there
be
no
black
school.
if
your
honor
please,
of
course
that
order
as
it
applies
to
the
charlotte
mecklenburg
school
board
plan
of
february
2nd
is
referring
to
the
nine
elementary
schools
and
the
one
junior
high
school,
that
remained
predominantly
black
under
the
board
plan
with
black
ratios
extending
from
83%
to
99%
which
means
that
in
some
of
those
total
of
10
schools,
there
were
up
to
17%
whites.
at
the
one
junior
high,
that
was
90%
black
and
10%
white.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
he
did.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no
sir.
on
the
contrary,
exactly
the
opposite.
it
is
because
of
his
order
in
this
extent.
that
there
was
imposed
on
the
board
what
is
called
the
court
ordered
finger
plan
with
all
its
cross
busing
at
the
elementary
level,
the
so
called
satellite
busing
is
the
junior
high
level
to
get
rid
of
the
one
black
school
and
incidentally
it's
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
junior
high
level,
that
involved
busing
out
2700
black
children
out
to
outlying
suburban
junior
high
school,
busing
2700
because
there
were
758
black
that
made
up
and
90%
of
this
one
junior
high.
and
of
course
the
same
as
true
at
the
senior
high
level
and
that's
already
been
alluded
to
except
that
had
a
different
switch
and
twist
on
it.
you
talk
about
balancing.
it's
there.
it's
there
at
the
elementary
level
with
its
cross
busing
and
satellite
busing
at
the
junior
high.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
if
your
honor,
please,
the
final
order
if
you're
referring
to
the
august
3rd
order,
i
remind
the
court
that
there
were
those
july
hearings
that
were
undertaken
as
result
of
remand.
where
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
on
the
test
of
reimburse
to
and
he
found
his
february
5
order
reasonable.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir,
he
reinstated
it.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir
that's
correct.
that's
in
both
and
there
again,
i
would
suggest
to
by
your
honors
if
there's
--
if
there
really
is
any
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
racial
balancing
is
involved
in
this
case.
i
refer
you
to
what
mr.
justice
white
just
alluded
to
and
upon
examination
mr.
justice
white,
you'll
find
several
other
portions
of
the
order
of
similar
import.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
black,
it's
hard
to
define
where
the
twilight
zone
but
you've
got
the
whole
hog
arrangement
where
every
school
in
a
system,
for
instance
charlotte-mecklenburg
has
70:30.
i
mean
that's
the
ultimate.
then
i
think
you
have
racial
balancing
as
the
goal,
the
objective
to
be
achieved.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
racial
balancing
is
a
device
that
has
as
its
objective,
the
proportionizing
of
the
student
bodies.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
whether
they
live
there
or
not
among
the
individual
schools.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
well,
every
school,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
believe
the
concept
of
racial
balancing
can
be
short.
you
can
still
have
something
that
is
properly
designated
as
racial
balancing
that
falls
short
of
the
ultimate.
now
judge
mcmillan,
he
had
and
matter
effect.
he
said,
“i'm
not
racial
balancing.
i
have
no
order
of
racial
balancing.
i'm
merely
directing
racial
diversity”
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it's
a
word
game.
and
so.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
but
what
i
do
suggest
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
give
real,
sincere
application
to
the
court
of
appeals
test
of
reasonableness.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
in
only
that
degree
would
i
put
a
proscriptive
your
honors
own
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
and
if
your
honor,
is
asking
me.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
do
i
think
that
is
the
ultimate
issue?
my
answer
is
yes.
if
your
honor
is
asking
me,
whether
i
think
that
it
is
a
constitutional
imperative,
i
say
no.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
intended
to
address
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
sir?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
throughout
the
session
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
your
honor,
that
is
a
tough
one
and
that's
why
you
asked
it.
i
would
say
no
but
i
want
to
put
–
that
no
the
school
board
could
not
even
within
the
realm
of
its
plenary
powers
and
those
powers
indeed
are
broad.
i
would
put
this
postscript
on
my
response.
as
i
again,
going
to
allude
to
later
but
i'll
now
to
an
extent.
and
you
talked
about
the
rights
of
individual.
be
they
blacks
to
attend
a
desegregated
as
part
of
a
desegregated
system
for
the
reverse
rights
that
mr.
justice
white
referred
to,
of
the
whites
whether
their
rights
are
being
imposed
upon
or
used
as
it
were
and
hence
denied
under
the
equal
protection.
i
think
that
both
of
those
rights
at
the
end
of
the
spectrum
like
almost
any
other
item
of
the
constitution
is
not
a
hard
nosed
absolute.
your
honors
may
recall
that
we
attempted
to
develop
that
thought
which
time
does
not
permit
now
in
detail
in
our
brief.
in
response
to
the
comments
of
judge
sobeloff
and
winters
and
judge
mcmillan
who
views
these
rights
as
absolute,
absolute
rights
to
attend
a
school
with
some
acceptable
mix.
and
that
is
an
individual
right
and
it
cannot
be
taken
away
from
them.
it
cannot
be
denied.
well
to
that
i
say,
as
we
said
in
brief
that
that
right
as
well
as
freedom
of
speech,
and
the
right
to
counsel,
jury
cases
for
all
the
rest
of
it.
they
all
and
this
court
has
recognized
long,
series
of
cases
are
subject
to
an
application
of
reasonable.
now,
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
a
school
board
can
reasonably
go
to
a
point
and
require
racial
balancing
or
maybe
i
would
better
say
that
they
would
have
to
go
to
a
point
that
might
involve
some
mixing.
a
countenance
of
the
races
as
it
were.
but
they
probably
could
not
go
even
on
their
own
inherent
power,
so-called,
plenary
powers.
i
mean,
they
could
not
go
beyond
the
point
where
they
edict
a
racial
balancing
if
that's
the
case.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
it
gets
down
with
a
reason
why
the
differential
was
made,
if
it
were
made
strictly
if
you
would
presume
with
me
for
a
racial
balancing
reason.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
certainly
they
can.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
goes
without
saying
that
school
boards
make
the
differences
such
as
your
honor
suggested
everyday
in
administrating
the
educational
program
for
one
reason
or
another
of
school
system.
so
of
course,
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
you
stated
it
much
better
than
i
did
mr.
justice
black.
with
reference
to
this,
all
black
school
business,
i
would
say
this
that
the
what
is
the
nature
of
the
right
that
let's
say
it's
a
black
child
or
although
it
could
be
of
white,
what
is
his
right
under
the
brown
and
green
decisions?
it's
our
view
that
it
is
not
a
right
to
attend
a
particular
school
of
a
particular
mix.
on
the
contrary,
it
is
the
right
of
a
child
to
go
to
school
in
a
system
where
every
vestige
of
discrimination
has
been
eradicated.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
on
a
count
of
race.
and
that
i
would
agree
therefore,
that
if
a
school
board
undertakes
to
evolve
a
plan
as
indeed
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
one
did,
that
evolve
zones,
evolve
zones
where
the
net
result
and
where
those
lines
ran
at
absolutely
no
racial
bias
to
them
at
all.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
excuse
me,
i
concede
that.
and
it
is
that
phase
of
it
which
your
honor
referred
that
occasions
are
coming
that
our
school
board
plan
of
february
2nd
went
far
beyond
what
the
constitutional
imperative
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
it
did.
i
mean
that
(voice
overlap)
obviously
it
did.
admittedly
it
did
and
it
went
far
beyond
what
we
say
we
were
required
to
do
it.
so
i
say
that
the
right
of
the
child
is
to
be
a
part
of
the
system.
and
hence
that
is
the
opposite
of
what
the
petitioners
contend
for
and
that
is
that
a
child
has
a
right
and
must
eradicate
every
black
school.
i'd
like
to
address
--
sir?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
not
quite,
i
say
your
last
namely
that
duty
of
a
school
board
who
established
a
non
discriminatory
system.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
so
i'm
with
you
on
that
phase
of
it.
there's
other
phase
of
it
is
the
first
part.
i
say
of
course
the,
let's
say
the
black
child
of
this
isn't
true.
he
has
a
constitutional
right
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
the
next
question
is
what
is?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
say
it
is
to
go
to
school
in
a
system
that
where
as
far
as
pupil
assignment
is
concerned,
the
areas
however
devised,
however
arranged
are
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
without
any
racial
balance.
that
is
his
right
to
be
a
part
of
that
system.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
as
far
as
back
to
this
racial
balancing
business,
the
time
is
running
short
but
i
would
commend
to
your
honor's
consideration,
the
following
portions
of
the
district
court
order
if
there's
any
lingering
doubt
that
in
fact
judge
mcmillan
did
prescribe
racial
balancing.
appendix
710-a
to
december
1
order,
the
appendix
822-a
of
the
february
5
order.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
well
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
appendix
710-a,
that's
the
december
1
order
and
that's
where
he
said
that
the
court
will
start
with
the
goal
or
that
there
should
be
idea
of
the
71:29
ratio.
appendix
822-a,
that's
the
february
5
order.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
this
was
the
portion
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
it's
at
paragraph
12
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
well
it
starts
down
there
and
default
of
any
such
plan,
the
court
will
start
with
authority
that
it
advanced
the
order
april
23,
that
effort
should
be
made
to
ratio
to
71:29
ratio.
how
well
i'll
do
on
this
other
paragraph
number,
but
second
is
february
5
order,
appendix
page
822-a.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
the
one
mr.
justice
white
referred
to.
and
the
next
one
which
needs
a
little
emphasis,
that
is
also
in
the
february
5
order,
823-a
wherein
the
court
said
that
the
school
board
shall
maintain
a
continuing
control
over
the
race
of
the
children.
and
then
at
appendix
page
824-a
of
the
february
5
order,
and
again,
shall
adapt
and
implement
a
continuing
program
computerized
or
otherwise
with
assigning
pupils
for
the
conscious
purpose
of
keeping
things
in
a
condition
of
desegregation.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
forever
you
mean?
is
that
your
question?
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
chief
justice,
your
idea
about
this
is
good
as
mine,
and
i
have
none.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
think
very
definitely
that
is
what
he
is
saying
to
us
and
i
think
it
portends
rather
grave
problems
as
a
constitutional
matter
and
as
a
practical
matter,
from
here
now.
i
think
judge
mcmillan
basically
will
be
an
ex-official
member
of
our
school
board
for
i
don't
know
how
long.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
this
court
was
instituted
back
in
63,
64,
65.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no
sir,
we
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
marshall,
we're
deeply
concerned
about
the
future.
not
only
acquit
in
full
major
our
constitutional
obligation
and
apart
from
the
constitution
to
fully
acquit
our
sales
to
the
children.
black
and
white
in
our
community,
we
want
to
get
back
to
education.
that's
why
we're
concerned
about
the
future.
we
want
to
bring
this
thing
to
a
(inaudible).
and
we
hope
that
this
--
as
a
result
of
this
case,
we
may
be
enabled
to
do
that.
so
we're
very
much
concerned.
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
think
that,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
school
board
went
to
this
school
board
plan
that
we
say
it
went
beyond
the
constitution
“voluntarily”
under
the
pressure
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
there
was
no
problem
on
that
school.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
no
sir.
see,
they
didn't
come
in
to
the
picture
really
until
the
july
hearings.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
the
hew
came
into
the
picture
as
a
result
of
the
court
of
appeals,
may
26
opinion,
when
it
was
remanded
with
the
strong
suggestion,
i
think
it
was
that
the
hew
be
brought
into
the
picture
and
this
is
the
result
of
their
plan.
our
plan,
i
might
add
that
was
shot
down
by
everybody
inside.
i
think
it's
well
known
that
we
have
had
a
badly
divided
board.
and
it's
nine
members,
five
to
four,
and
it
was
–
it's
significant
that
this
was
about
the
first
unanimous
vote
that
they've
had
on
that
board
and
i
don't
know
how
many
years,
unanimous
vote
against
the
hew
plan,
incidentally
for
these
reasons.
number
one,
it
had
a
great
structure
where
for
example,
when
zone
number
four,
there
are
three
elementary
schools,
i
don't
remember
specifics
but
there's
one
group
of
children
that
go
for
grades
one
and
two
here
and
three
and
four
here
and
then
another
one,
and
some
of
the
zones,
the
children
go
to
four
different
elementary
schools
during
the
course
of
their
sick
years
of
elementary
schooling.
that
busing
under
it
was
the
district
court
judge
found
was
about
on
a
par
with
what
his
estimates
were
of
the
finger
plan
and
the
board
minority
plan
and
furthermore
they
came
out
with
ratios
projected
to
50%
to
57%
that
we
knew
they
would
never
stick,
all
in
the
world,
you
would
have
would
be
to
end
up
with
re-segregation
and
in
the
next
place,
they
used
schools
in
these
clusters,
in
this
mixing
process
which
is
another
type
of
racial
balancing,
used
and
employed
schools
that
were
already
desegregated
under
our
school
plan.
well,
that
in
passing
are
the
few
reasons
why
neither
the
district
judge
nor
the
school
board
had
any
tolerance
for
the
hew
plan.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
mr.
justice
white,
that's
going
to
be
a
subject
matter
of
the
next
two
cases
and
i
thought
as
we
would
finess.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir.
let
me
try
my
own
articulation
to
a
question
you
asked
mr.
wagonner.
as
far
as
the
district
court's
order
is
concerned,
we
are
offended
by
it
because
it
says
that
we
can't
have
a
black
school.
it
is
based
upon
racial
balancing
and
it
was
a
court
order
supplanting
of
a
board
plan
that
we
feel
was
thoroughly
constitutional
because
it
was
based
and
established
its
lines
on
completely
non
racial
ground.
now
that
is
why
we
take
offense
at
judge
mcmillan‘s
order.
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
is
concerned,
i
must
digress
to
remind
ourselves
what
did
they
do?
it's
then
the
objective
of
the
district
court
at
all
three
instructional
lesson,
with
elementary,
junior,
and
senior.
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeal
is
concerned,
what
did
they
do?
well,
we
approve
their
rule
or
reason,
simply
because
in
our
view,
in
the
name
of
commonsense,
you
got
to
have
a
rule
or
reason
about
almost
anything.
so,
but
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeal
applied,
misapplied
its
own
rule
in
the
sense
that
it
too
issued
a
ruling
that
was
based
on
the
racial
balancing
for
these
reasons.
what
did
just
court
of
appeals
did
that
the
elementary
level,
they
say
said,
the
school
board
--
you
haven't
done
enough
so
judge
mcmillan,
you've
done
too
much.
there's
too
much
busing
and
transportation
in
this
location
and
so
forth
when
that
super
imposed
upon
the
secondary
level,
junior,
and
senior
high.
so
in
effect,
this
court
of
appeals
found
judge
mcmillan's
elementary
plan
to
be
unreasonable,
you
went
back
took
another
look
at
it
and
found
that
sure
enough,
he
was
reasonable
all
along.
at
the
junior
and
senior
high
school
levels,
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
and
said
yes
that's
not
so
bad.
that's
okay”.
but
in
so
doing
it,
they
approved
the
satellite
busing
and
the
balancing
at
the
junior
high
and
what
is
the
most
glaring
example
already
alluded
to
at
the
senior
high,
they
approved
that.
that's
the
300
black
children
from
the
inner
city
that
bus
1213
miles
out
to
independence
high,
that
under
the
board
plan
had
a
2%
black
population.
it
took
to
300
from
schools
that
we
already
had
it
almost
perfect
mixing
under
the
board
plan.
and
the
only
reason
they
bus
those
300
black
kids
was
to
make
a
white
school
less
white.
so,
really
although
the
smaller
problem,
the
most
glaring
single
example
of
racial
balancing
is
the
senior
high.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
you're
so
right.
yes
you
correctly
state
--
i
was
using
our
approval
for
the
rule
of
reason
there
in
the
sense
that.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
that's
correct.
then
it
also
does
have
a
technical
connotation
in
the
sense
that
in
brief
as
i've
already
mentioned,
we
developed
a
line
of
argument
there
that
says
a
constitutional
right
and
an
individual's
constitutional
right
in
a
multitude
of
areas,
religion,
speech
the
jury
accounts
and
so
on,
is
nevertheless
subject
to,
it
is
not
absolute.
you
can't
run
into
a
building,
crowded
building,
horrified
and
so
forth.
the
counsel
you
know
that
six
months
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
i
think
the
rule
is
absolute
--
but
i
think
the
rule,
it's
an
absolute
as
a
requirement
but
in
order
as
complex
things
are
in
order
to
accord
that
right
or
protect
that
right.
i
think
you
immediately
thrust
back
into
some
type
of
feasibility
or
rule
of
reason
and
incidentally
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
and
i
think
it's
a
very
--
exact
standard.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
sir.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
perhaps
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
really
and
in
brief
--
where
we're
talking
about
the
cost
of
buses
and
numbers
of
buses,
and
this
location
in
brief
in
particular
what
is
it
involved
with
case
–
mere
distinction
between
where
petty
crimes
leave
off
and
they
have
a
right
to
counsel
--
if
it's
less
than
six
months
you
don't
but
why,
it
goes
for
the
efficient,
expedient
administration
of
justice
which
brings
you
right
into
a
practical
reasonable
feasibility
aspect.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
along
the
line.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
yes
sir
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
commences
at
--
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
because
it
is
reasonable.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
the
test
of
reasonableness
as
expounded
by
the
court
of
appeals,
appears
on
appendix
page
12
67-a.
i
don't
have
a
reason
for
this.
see,
what
they
did,
they
vacated
the
judgment
and
remanded
it.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
you're
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals
[voice
overlap]
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
not
specifically.
the
majority
of
the
court
never
admitted
that
they
were
condoning
or
using
racial
balancing.
the
dissenting
judge
who
joined
the
majority
in
order
to
have
a
requisite
vote,
bryan
called
it
like
it
was
and
said,
“you're
talking
terms
of
integration,
but
i'm
telling
that
like
it
is,
it's
really
racial
balancing
you're
doing”
so
you
have
to
read
the
opinion
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
--
.
mr.
benjamin
s.
horack
that's
where
the
test
of
reasonableness
is
set
forth
by
the
court.
