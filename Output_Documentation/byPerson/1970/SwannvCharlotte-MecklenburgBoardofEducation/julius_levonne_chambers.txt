mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
number
281
and
349,
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
directed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
adopted
a
new
reasonableness
test,
approved
the
plan
of
the
district
court
for
the
junior
and
senior
high
schools,
and
vacated
the
decision
and
directed
further
consideration
of
a
plan
for
the
elementary
schools
requiring
that
the
district
court
apply
a
reasonableness
test.
the
plaintiff's
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari,
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
number
281
on
june
30,
reinstated
the
district
court's
plan
of
desegregation
and
authorized
further
hearing
by
the
district
court
as
had
been
directed
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
district
court
conducted
further
hearings
during
july
1970.
and
on
august
3,
1970,
applying
the
fourth
circuit's
new
test
of
reasonableness
found
a
plan
and
had
directed
in
february
1970
to
be
reasonable
and
reinstated
its
february
5th
order.
the
school
board
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari
prior
to
the
decision
by
the
fourth
circuit.
this
court
granted
that
petition
on
october
6th,
along
with
the
petition
of
the
school
board
to
review
the
plan
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
junior
and
senior
high
schools
which
the
fourth
circuit
had
approved
as
reasonable.
the
court
therefore
has
before
it,
the
complete
plan
of
the
district
court
which
had
been
directed
in
february
1970,
and
re-approved
by
the
district
court
on
august
3rd,
1970.
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
can
be
sustained
under
the
equitable
discretion
of
that
court
as
authorized
by
brown.
we
submit
however,
that
the
constitutional
principles
by
which
the
district
court
was
guided
particularly
the
requirement
for
the
elimination
of
all
black
and
racially
identifiable
black
schools.
on
this
record
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we're
clearly
correct
and
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
your
honor
that
under
the
appellate
procedural
rules
for
considering
cases
on
appeal
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
or
--
to
support
the
decision
below
that
the
court
should
sustain
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
the
issues
on
this
case
are
one,
whether
the
school
board
may
continue
to
perpetuate
all
black
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
where
such
schools
have
been
created
and
fostered
by
state
acts,
and
possible
means
are
available
to
disestablish
such
schools.
secondly,
whether
the
reasonableness
test
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
would
permit
continued
operation
or
state
created,
all
black
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
although
feasible
means
are
available
to
desegregate
such
schools
is
an
acceptable
constitutional
test
to
be
applied
in
school
desegregation
cases.
the
facts
briefly
summarized
are
these.
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
alexander
v.
holmes,
county
board
of
education,
45,012
up
to
59,828
white
students
in
this
system
were
attending
all
white
or
racially
identifiable
white
schools.
16,000
of
the
24,714
black
students
were
in
all
black
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
these
students
were
attending
82
of
the
106
schools
in
the
system,
only
24
of
these
schools
were
not
racially
identifiable.
judge
sobeloff
noted
in
his
dissent
that
the
extensive
segregation
in
this
system
was
not
fortuitous
that
it
had
resulted
from
practices
of
the
school
board
which
had
interacted
with
other
governmental
discriminatory
practices.
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
black
and
white
population
in
this
system,
in
school
and
at
home,
were
virtually,
entirely
segregated.
as
the
district
court
noted,
more
black
students
were
in
segregated
schools
in
1970
than
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
1954.
the
court
had
found
in
april
of
1969,
that
schools
had
been
segregated
or
their
racial
identity
perpetuated
by
practices
and
policies
of
the
school
board.
the
board
had
located
schools,
controlled
school
size,
grade
structure,
in
order
to
maintain
segregated
schools.
the
board
had
also
controlled
school
districts
and
transportation
to
perpetuate
racially
segregated
schools.
it
is
too
late
in
the
day,
16
years
after
brown
to
now
construct
some
ingenious
device
to
avoid
the
brown
decision.
black
children
and
parents
in
charlotte
have
struggled
since
brown
and
began
in
1965,
with
litigation
in
order
to
obtain
a
decree
as
the
district
court
entered
in
this
case.
they
desired
desegregated
education
and
know
that
it
can
only
be
obtained
under
a
plan
like
the
one
directed
by
the
district
court
below.
it
would
be
a
rejection
of
the
faith
that
black
children
and
parents
have
had
in
brown,
the
hope
of
eventually
obtaining
a
desegregated
education.
for
this
court
now
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
and
now
adopt
16
years
after
brown,
a
test
that
would
sanction
the
continued
operation
of
racially
segregated
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
one
your
honor
that
has
a
substantial
disproportionate
number
of
black
students
in
the
school
and
consideration
of
the
percentage
of
black
students
in
the
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
sir.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
of
a
case
and
the
facts
in
the
case.
in
this
system
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
excess
of
50%
black
in
a
particular
school
would
make
that
school
racially
identifiable.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
this
system
your
honor,
i
think
that
90%
white
would
perhaps
or
excess
of
90%
white
would
perhaps
make
it
racially
identifiable.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
this
system
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
district
court
was
basically
concerned
with
the
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
but
in
the
november
decision
of
the
district
court,
which
appears
on
page
655
of
the
appendix,
the
court
sets
out
the
schools
that
considers
to
be
racially
identifiable
white
and
racially
identifiable
black,
this
appears
on
page
660a,
and
here
the
court
says
that
schools
that
are
86
to
89%
white
or
higher
are
considered
racially
identifiable
white.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
86%,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
50%
black
or
higher.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
did
not
have
segregated
schools?
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
in
this
system
that
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct.
and
that
the
practices
of
the
board
which
perpetuated
the
segregated
system
continued
down
through
the
present
act.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
segregated
school
system
considered
by
the
district
court
below
was
the
result
of
the
blatant
practices
of
the
school
board
designed
to
perpetuate
a
racially
segregated
system,
that
the
district
court
directed
a
plan
that
was
both
feasible
and
effective
to
a
court,
equal
educational
opportunities
to
the
black
children.
that
the
reasonableness
test
of
the
fourth
circuit
were
merely
postponed
the
enjoinment
of
constitutional
rights
by
black
children
in
the
system,
that
the
school
board,
the
federal
government
and
the
amici
who
have
submitted
briefs
in
this
matter,
offer
no
viable
alternative
constitutional
standard
to
that
--
followed
by
the
district
court
below.
and
that
this
court
should
now
clearly
announce
the
rule,
that
every
black
child
who
has
been
segregated,
or
denied
equal
educational
opportunities
by
state
practices,
is
to
be
free
from
assignment
to
identifiable
black
schools
at
every
grade
and
every
stage
of
his
educational
experience.
the
district
court
described
charlotte-mecklenburg
“the
central
city
maybe
likened
to
an
automobile
hubcap.
the
perimeter
area
to
a
wheel
and
the
county
area
to
a
rubber
tire.”
we
have
here
a
map
which
shows
the
charlotte
and
mecklenburg
county
area
that
the
court
was
concerned
with.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
alright.
the
area
the
court
was
presently
concerned
with
was
the
central
area
of
the
city,
which
the
court
likened
to
a
hubcap.
this
is
where
the
blacks
are
principally
located
in
the
city.
the
court
described
the
dividing
line
between
the
black
and
white
residents
in
the
city
as
the
north
trans-southern
railroad
line.
95%
of
the
black
residents
in
the
city
are
concentrated
in
the
small
northwestern
part
of
the
city.
the
district
court
found
and
this
finding
was
approved
by
the
fourth
circuit
that
governmental
practices
had
created
and
contributed
to
this
racially
segregated
patterns.
one
of
the
most
pervasive
was
the
practice
of
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education,
both
before
and
after
1954.
both
before
and
after
1954,
the
board
located
schools
and
controlled
school
sites
to
perpetuate
segregation.
several
all
black
and
all
white
schools
have
been
built
and/or
have
had
additions
since
1954.
the
board
limited
the
capacities
of
schools,
controlled
grade
structure
and
school
districts
and
used
transportation
to
perpetuate
segregation.
the
district
court
found
that
the
board
had
limited
and
controlled
school
sizes
and
districts
to
perpetuate
segregation,
and
of
the
23,600
students
transported
in
this
system
in
1969
and
1970,
only
541
were
transported
to
black
schools.
the
court
further
considered
the
governmental
practices,
which
had
contributed
to
the
segregated
housing
pattern.
the
court
considered
the
urban
renewal
program,
public
housing,
zoning,
city
planning,
streets
and
highways,
and
private
discrimination.
all
of
these
practices
had
interacted
and
created
or
fostered
the
segregated
system
that
was
before
the
district
court.
additionally,
state
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions,
which
the
district
court
collected
in
its
august
3rd
opinion
all
contributed
to
the
segregated
system.
the
fourth
circuit
found
compelling
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
governmentally
created
segregated
schools
and
housing,
and
accepted
the
district
court's
findings
on
the
traditional
practices
of
appellate
review.
the
government
concedes
these
findings
and
indeed
asserts
that
these
practices,
particularly
those
of
the
school
board
contribute
it
to
the
segregated
system.
we
have
therefore
an
(inaudible)
state
action
case,
no
different
from
that
considered
by
the
court
in
brown.
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
district
court
was
constitutionally
obligated
to
direct
preparation
and
implementation
of
a
plan
that
would
disestablish
the
segregated
schools
root
and
branch.
the
district
court
sought
to
do
this
by
directing
the
board
to
prepare
such
a
plan.
on
three
occasions,
the
board
simply
refused
to
submit
a
plan
which
would
discharge
its
constitutional
obligation.
in
december,
in
default
by
the
board,
the
district
court
appointed
an
educational
consultant
to
assist
the
court
in
preparing
a
plan.
the
court
directed
that
the
consultant
followed
such
techniques
as
were
necessary
to
disestablish
the
all
black
schools
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools.
the
court
set
forth
19
principles
to
govern
the
court
consultant.
we
submit
that
the
principles
set
forth
were
clearly
within
the
discretionary
authority
of
the
court,
seeking
to
fashion
an
equitable
remedy.
this
is
particularly
true
where
the
party
principally
responsible
has
failed
to
discharge
its
obligation.
the
problem
facing
the
consultant
were
these,
one
senior
high
school,
four
junior
high
schools
and
17
elementary
schools
were
all
black.
the
concentration
of
negro
students,
and
these
schools
was
in
a
triangle,
roughly
four
or
five
miles
on
each
side.
nearly
two
third
or
16,000
of
the
black
students
were
concentrated
in
these
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor,
we
have
a
diagram
here
which
shows
the
concentration
of
these
schools
and
the
north-south
dividing
line
that
the
court
mentioned.
this
line
running
through
here
is
the
north
tryon
street,
and
it
picks
up
the
southern
railroad.
this
line
running
here
is
trade
street
which
the
district
court
mentioned
in
this
order.
the
concentration
of
the
black
students
were
in
this
triangle,
from
billingsville
school
up
to
the
northwestern
part
of
the
city
over
to
william
school
and
then
back
down
to
the
billingsville
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
a
traced
from
the
map
presented
here.
and
as
the
court
found,
sides
running
along
this
triangle
were
four
or
five
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
was
addressing
my
answer
to
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
depend
again
on
the
circumstances
of
a
case
and
as
we
defined
racially
identifiable
school
and
would
be
one
where
the
concentration
of
black
students
is
substantially
disproportioned
to
the
percentage
of
black
and
white
students
in
the
system.
now
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
would
agree
your
honor
provided
that
there
are
plans
available
which
can
be
implemented
to
eliminate
that
disproportionate
representation.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
for
racial
balance
as
we
understand
both
the
board
and
the
government
to
be
saying.
we
tried
to
set
that
forth
in
a
reply
brief
to
the
government's
brief.
we
are
asking
for
a
plan
that
would
disestablish
the
racial
identity
of
all
schools
in
the
system,
in
a
segregated
system.
and
we
think
that
particularly
in
this
system
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
we
have
a
plan
that
can
disestablish
all
racially
identifiable
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
i
do
your
honor.
the
fourth
circuit
begun
this
test
and
i
might
say
that
this
is
basically
the
test
that
is
proposed
by
the
government.
with
the
statement
that
some
schools
can
remain
all
black
or
segregated
in
a
unitary
system.
it
talks
about
the
limits
that
might
be
imposed
and
the
test
that
we
are
proposing
is
one
that
would
begin
with
the
assumption
that
all
schools
can
be
desegregated
and
would
require
that
these
schools
be
desegregated
unless
no
plan
would
be
workable
or
could
possibly
be
implemented.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
for
an
absolute
ratio
or
percentage
in
each
school.
we're
arguing
only
for
a
test
that
would
require
no
substantial
disproportionate
representation
or
concentration
of
black
students
in
a
particular
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
can't
say
because
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
could
be
a
factor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
have
some
difficulty
with
the
neighborhood
school
but
if
the
students
are
assigned
according
to
non-racial
district
lines
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
all
the
factors
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
it
might
but
again
i'm
talking
about
hypothetical
that
i
can't
really
discuss
because
it
would
all
depend
on
what
the
facts
and
the
situation
would
be.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
that
again
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
and
facts.
it
might
but
with
all
the
factors
that
the
court
should
consider,
it
might
be
that
all
the
students
could
be
assigned
to
schools
without
any
substantial
disproportionate
representation
of
blacks
in
any
school
or
concentration.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
would
say
however
that
as
the
district
court
sought
to
do
here
that
it
might
be
an
ideal
objective
that
a
district
court
or
a
school
board
might
use
in
its
discretion
to
prepare
a
plan.
the
district
court
sought
to
direct
the
plan
that
would
utilize
the
various
techniques
that
had
been
utilized
by
the
board
in
preserving
segregation.
this
board
has
transported
23,600
students
during
the
1969-70
school
year,
an
additional
5,000
students
rode
city
buses
at
reduced
fares,
55%
or
670,000
students
statewide
were
transported
in
north
carolina.
approximately
50%
of
these
students
in
the
state
and
in
charlotte
were
being
transported
were
elementary
students
in
grades
one
to
six.
students
were
transported
in
charlotte-mecklenburg
approximately
34
miles
ground
trip
each
day.
the
trip
averaged
one
hour
and
15
minutes,
one
way.
charlotte-mecklenburg
also
transported
approximately
700
kindergarten
and
pre-school
students
ages
4
to
five
years
of
age
from
7
to
39
miles,
one
way
each
day.
the
average
cost
for
transporting
students
was
$20
per
students
per
year
or
22
cents
per
day.
transportation
had
been
previously
used
to
accommodate
and
perpetuate
segregation.
the
district
court
felt
that
they
might
also
--
that
transportation
might
also
be
used
in
order
to
desegregate
the
schools.
charlotte-mecklenburg
does
not
adhere
to
any
neighborhood
concept,
the
extensive
transportation
in
the
system
refute
any
such
notion,
nor
is
the
board
proposing
such
now,
particularly
with
the
high
schools
and
junior
high
schools,
the
basic
difference
between
the
plan
proposed
by
the
board
and
that
ordered
by
the
court
is
the
lack
of
contiguous
links
or
connecting
grids
in
the
court's
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
the
majority
of
the
23,000
students
transported
were
in
the
county,
the
5,000
students
being
transported
by
city
buses
were
in
the
city.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
public
transportation,
that's
correct.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
majority
of
them
were
out
in
the
county.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor
but
one
revealing
fact
in
this
record
is
that
the
school
board
had
purposely
located
white
schools,
so
that
they
would
require
transportation,
they
were
away
from
black
neighborhoods
and
as
i
indicated
among
the
goal
of
the
23,000
students
transported,
only
541
were
black.
so
the
schools
were
purposely
located,
so
that
23,000
students
being
transported
would
be
in
the
county
and
majority
white.
we
would
like
to
show
the
court
another
exhibit
that
we
prepared
from
the
map
of
the
school
board,
showing
that
there
is
basically
no
difference
between
the
plan
proposed
by
the
board
and
that
ordered
by
the
court
for
the
junior
high
schools.
this
is
a
map
prepared
by
the
board
for
the
junior
high
schools
limited
the
zones
to
contiguous
grids
within
the
map.
they
resulted
in
odd
shaped
district
zones
as
the
district
court
noted.
the
map
prepared
by
the
court
consultant
which
the
school
board
elected
to
implement
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
as
of
february
2nd
1970.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct,
yes.
and
it
resulted
in
junior
high
school
remaining
90%
black
and
that's
piedmont
junior
high
school
which
is
in
the
inner
city.
the
court
offered
the
board
four
alternatives
in
order
to
desegregate
that
school.
the
court
said
that
the
board
could
rezone
piedmont
district,
it
could
close
piedmont
school,
it
could
pirate
or
it
could
adopt
the
plan
proposed
by
the
court
consultant.
the
court
consultant
proposed
the
plan
that
to
establish
satellite
districts,
non-satellite
districts
were
established
for
the
junior
high
school
and
the
colors
on
the
map
show
that
the
school
district
that
the
satellite
has
been
established
for,
the
blue
school
district
in
the
center
for
instance,
is
set
up
to
be
satellite
to
eastway
junior
high
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
only
one
way.
but
i
should
point
out
however
that
in
the
zone
lines
that
were
retained
under
the
court
consultant
plan,
some
white
students
are
being
transported
into
the
formerly
all
black
junior
high
school,
and
jt
williams
is
an
example.
in
order
to
desegregate
jt
williams
school
which
is
in
the
intercity,
the
school
board
had
to
carry
its
lines
out
into
the
county
to
get
some
white
residents
to
bring
them
into
jt
william
school.
but
the
satellite
districts
that
were
established
by
the
court
consultant
involved
only
one
way
busing,
that's
black
students
being
transported
out
to
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
alright.
these
(inaudible)
white
schools.
and
to
show
the
similarity
between
the
plans
of
the
core
consultant
and
the
school
board,
we
have
a
diagram
here
of
eastway
junior
high
school,
and
as
i
mentioned
the
intercity
blue
satellite
is
satellite
to
eastway
junior
high
school.
it's
shown
there
on
the
diagram
in
black,
the
red
zone,
the
red
lines
show
the
zones
for
the
junior
high
school
of
the
board.
the
black
shows
the
satellite
district
and
the
school
that
the
satellite
district
serves.
the
smith
junior
high
school
is
another
example.
the
black
again
shows
the
satellite
district
and
the
satellite
school.
the
red
zone
is
a
line
for
--
that
was
proposed
by
the
school
board.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
some
areas,
the
students
were
previously
assigned
to
either
northwest
junior
high
school,
an
all
black
school
or
piedmont
junior
high
school
or
jt
williams.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
satellite
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
way
the
satellite
districts
are
proposed
here,
no
junior
high
school
is
in
the
satellite
area.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
anymore.
correct.
the
other
example
that
we
have
is
cochrane
junior
high
school
in
ag
--
alexander
graham
junior
high
school.
again,
the
satellite
districts
are
shown
in
black
and
the
board's
plan
is
shown
in
red.
the
one
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
satellite,
your
honor
is
a
non-contiguous
zone
established
to
serve
a
school
district.
for
instance,
the
satellite
district
here
would
be
the
black
zone,
which
is
not
contiguous
to
the
black
zones
around
cochrane
junior
high
school.
as
the
court
point
out
in
this
opinion
also,
the
efforts
of
the
school
board
to
use
contiguous
grids,
ignore
the
traffic
arteries.
the
grid
zones
that
the
board
sought
to
adhere
to
ran
diagonally
to
the
traffic.
both
the
superintendent
of
schools
and
the
core
consultant
said
that
the
plan
directed
by
the
court,
or
the
core
consultant
plan
would
be
much
easier
to
implement.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
shortened
the
traffic
time
and
it
was
also
easier
to
implement
because
we
had
the
traffic
arteries
that
were
considered
by
the
core
consultant
in
proposing
the
satellite
districts.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor
because
the
satellite
districts
used
the
traffic
arteries
where
the
zone
lines,
the
contiguous
zones
did
not.
some
students,
for
instance,
in
the
(inaudible)
proposed
by
the
board
would
not
even
be
on
a
street
that
could
be
serviceable
for
the
school
to
which
the
students
were
assigned.
this
is
equally
true
of
the
elementary
schools.
the
board
proposed
again
to
adhere
to
contiguous
zones.
it
also
proposed
to
limit
the
schools
that
white
students
could
be
assigned
to,
to
schools
having
60%
or
more
white
students.
the
plan
proposed
by
the
board
would
leave
nine
elementary
schools,
90%
or
more
black.
the
plan
proposed
by
the
core
consultant
did
not
limit
itself
to
contiguous
zones.
the
core
consultant
clustered
ten
black
elementary
schools,
with
24
white
elementary
schools.
again,
the
core
consultant
was
utilizing
devices
that
had
been
used
by
the
board
to
preserve
the
segregated
system.
the
core
consultant
stated
that
the
clustered
schools
were
purposely
arranged
along
arterial
routes,
so
that
the
students
could
easily
be
transported
to
the
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
comparing
has
been
used
to
describe
the
consolidation
of
two
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
with
two
way
movement.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
clustering
means
the
pairing
of
one
might
use
that
were
a
grouping
of
three
or
more
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
it's
possible
your
honor,
or
you
might
use
the
school
district
that
is
not
contiguous
with
the
school
district
that
is
the
--
as
used
in
the
question.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
we're
talking
about
numbers
of
schools
for
pairing,
and
we're
talking
about
an
increased
number
of
schools
for
clustering.
in
the
plan
here
for
instance
that
was
proposed
by
the
core
consultant,
the
color
show
the
schools
that
are
clustered.
for
instance,
the
blue
cluster
in
the
intercity
is
lincoln
high
school,
and
it's
clustered
--
lincoln
high
school.
and
it's
clustered
with
mary
oaks
and
8
mile
road
(ph)
and
ottawa
school.
so
we
have
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
have
three
--
well
the
three
white
schools
clustered
with
one
black
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
are
all
either
two
white
and
one
black
or
three
white
and
one
black
school.
i
don't
think
either
one
involves
more
than
three
white
schools.
another
example
of
the
cluster
is
the
university
park
elementary
school
which
is
clustered
with
ray
marold
(ph)
and
montclair
elementary
school
and
they
are
shown
in
red.
and
as
the
core
consultant
stated,
these
schools
are
all
arranged
on
traffic
arteries,
so
that
the
students
can
be
easily
transported
to
and
from
the
elementary
schools,
and
the
cluster
is
taking
consideration
of
the
size
of
the
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
the
way
we
have
been
using
the
term.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
they
can
be
contiguous.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
you
mean
from
school
to
school,
or
from
the
outer
limits
of
the
perimeter.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
according
to
the
information
supplied
by
the
board,
at
the
february
--
at
the
july
1970
hearing,
the
longest
distance
in
any
of
the
clusters
would
be
12
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
but
the
board
was
measuring
from
the
outer
edge
of
the
boundary
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
boundary
of
the
school
that
was
involved.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
have
the
maximum
distance
from
school
to
school
in
that
cluster.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it's
less
than
12
miles.
and
in
addition
your
honor,
the
court
found
that
the
average
distance
that
the
student
would
be
transported
in
all
of
the
clusters
would
be
seven
miles.
and
it
would
take
35
minutes,
and
this
is
far
less
than
the
average
of
the
students
that
are
being
transported
in
the
system
today
or
in
1969-70.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
the
court
found
that
the
average
mile
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
have
the
actual
maximum
distance,
but
one
of
the
exhibits
that
we
produce
show
that
some
students
transported
as
much
as
three
-and-a-half
hours,
one
way.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
hours.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes.
one
way.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
know
the
mileage
of
that
your
honor,
as
shown
on
an
exhibit
that
was
produced
that
the
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
it
would
be
less
than
90
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
know
the
exact
mileage
that
was
involved
in
that
but
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
within
the
schools
affected,
the
maximum
mileage
according
to
the
information
supplied
by
the
board
was
12.5
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
sir.
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
other
23,000
students.
the
plan
that
was
directed
by
the
district
court
did
not
affect
the
majority
of
the
23,000
students
who
were
previously
transferred
or
transported.
they
were
in
the
areas,
that
are
marked
in
white
or
they
have
not
been
colored.
the
plan
that
the
district
court
ordered
for
the
elementary
schools
particularly,
involved
only
the
colored
zones.
the
core
consultant
used
the
zones
for
the
other
schools
that
were
not
involved
in
clusters.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
do
not
have
before
me
your
honor,
the
maximum
miles
that
students
were
transported
previously.
the
longest
distance
--
it
is
in
an
exhibit
that
we
introduced
at
the
march
1970
hearing.
it's
the
same
exhibit
that
shows
that
the
students
were
transported.
some
students
were
transported
three
hours
and
a
half.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
can't
say
the
maximum
difference
between
the
old
and
the
new
because
i
don't
know
the
maximum
distance
previously.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
average
previously
was
15
--
was
17
miles.
the
average
under
the
order
directed
by
the
district
court
is
seven
miles.
i
don't
know
the
longest
mile
previously
but
the
longest
mile
under
the
plan
directed
by
the
district
court,
was
12.5
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well
your
honor
as
the
district
court
found,
the
students
involved
in
the
plan
directed
by
the
court
were
being
transported
less
distance
and
at
less
time
than
previously
existed
in
the
system.
now,
we
do
not
have
or
i
don't
have
today
the
longest
distance
that
was
involved
under
the
old
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
we
will
be
glad
to
supply
the
court
with
it.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
issue
or
basic
issue
involved
is
whether
a
school
board
can
continue
to
perpetuate
segregated
schools,
where
these
schools
have
been
created
by
state
practices
or
state
action.
when
a
feasible
plan
is
available
to
disestablish
the
segregated
schools.
basically,
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
in
its
reasonableness
test,
that
some
schools
can
be
maintained
segregated
in
a
unitary
system.
we
submit
that
they
cannot
be.
we
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
a
feasible
plan
that
will
desegregate
the
schools,
and
that
the
district
court
was
properly
correct
in
saying
that
all
black
schools
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools
in
this
system
should
be
eliminated.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
from
the
point
of
view
of
students.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
under
the
plan
directed
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no
your
honor,
there
isn't.
we
contend
and
submit
that
that
provision
or
that
kind
of
a
provision
will
not
satisfy
the
board's
requirement
to
desegregate
the
schools.
it
is
a
provision
that
the
government
advocate
should
be
included
on
the
plan,
where
segregated
schools
are
retained.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
was
on
the
board's
plan
too.
but
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
the
board
had
imposed
limitations
on
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
be
unacceptable.
we
think
that
under
the
plan
that
the
district
court
has
directed
that
we
can
eliminate
all
black
and
racially
identifiable
black
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
blacks
are
interested
in
the
plan
being
implemented.
i
represent
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
your
honor
under
the
plan
directed,
there
wouldn't
be
any
black
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
this
court
has
answered
that
question
several
times.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
my
answer
is
the
same
as
this
court
that
the
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
the
school
board
and
the
court
might
legitimately
consider
race
and
has
to
consider
race
in
order
to
desegregate
a
school
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
this
court
has
said
that
in
green.
the
school
board
cannot
be
neutral.
it
has
created
a
segregated
system
and
it
has
to
now
consider
race
to
disestablish
it.
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
it,
said
it
in
weiner
(ph)
versus
the
arlington
school
board.
there
the
school
board
had
to
consider
race
in
order
to
desegregate
and
i
think
that
it's
absolutely
necessary
here
that
the
court
consider
race
to
desegregating.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
constitution
requires
that
school
boards
disestablish
or
dismantle
segregated
schools
that
they
have
created.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
an
equitable
remedy,
that
the
court
can
utilize
devices
that
have
been
used
by
school
officials
to
create
a
segregated
system.
i
think
further
that
the
school
board
and
the
court
are
not
limited
to
the
same
devices
that
have
been
used
to
create
a
segregated
system
but
can
go
use
other
devices
that
are
necessary
to
desegregate,
if
this
requires
busing
and
it
has
been
in
this
system
in
the
past
--
busing
has
been
used
in
the
past
to
segregate,
then
the
court
can
use
busing
in
order
to
desegregate.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
the
rule
would
be
a
bit
more
general,
that
being
that
the
court
--
the
board
would
have
to
use
what
means
were
necessary
which
would
require
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
if
it
would
require
busing,
then
i
think
that
the
constitution
will
require
that
the
board
utilize
the
facilities
to
do
so,
to
desegregate.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
the
constitution
requires
--
i
think
that
the
court
should
require
the
school
board
to
do
what
is
necessary
and
i
think
the
constitution
requires
that.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
this
way,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far
to
affirm
what
the
district
court
did
below.
i
think
however,
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
it
should
be
required.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
district
court
estimated,
it
would
be
138
buses.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
money
was
available
and
in
fact
the
court
found
below
that
no
additional
capital
outlay
was
necessary
in
order
to
desegregate
now.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
the
board
has
available
over
107
buses
which
the
district
court
found,
additionally
the
states
had
advised
the
board
that
it
would
loan
buses
to
it
which
the
board
would
have
to
replace
either
due
on
the
school
year
or
next
year.
and
in
fact
that's
what
i
understand
has
been
done.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
not
arguing
that
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
might
be
permissible
under
some
circumstances.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
green
said
that.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
correct.
the
test
proposed
by
the
government
and
by
the
school
board,
we
submit
is
unworkable
and
vague.
16
years
of
litigation
have
taught
us
that
vague
standards
and
test
of
good
faith
of
school
boards,
merely
prolong
the
day
that
black
children
are
able
to
enjoy
equal
educational
opportunities.
this
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
the
argument
advanced
by
the
school
board.
while
advocating
a
reasonableness
test,
the
board
contends
at
the
fourth
circuit
doesn't
know
how
to
apply
its
own
test,
because
the
fourth
circuit
was
sustaining
the
district
court's
order
with
respect
to
the
junior
and
senior
high
schools.
this
is
further
demonstrated
by
the
recent
case
considered
by
the
fourth
circuit
only
a
few
days
after
the
fourth
circuit
had
announced
its
new
rule.
this
was
a
case
in
clarendon
county,
where
small
school
district
contended
that
it
could
not
desegregate
the
schools
by
using
reasonable
means.
secondly,
the
fact
of
this
case
do
not
warrant
any
standard
as
proposed
or
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit.
again
the
facts
are
simple.
we
have
a
segregated
system
created
by
the
state
practices
and
we
have
at
hands
the
means
for
desegregation.
the
school
board
concedes
that
if
it
is
required
to
afford
black
children
in
the
system
and
equal
educational
opportunity
then
the
plan
directed
by
district
court
is
the
one
that
should
be
followed.
mr.
wagner,
my
opposing
counsel
reaffirmed
that
position
only
recently,
when
it
argued
before
the
district
court
during
july
1970
hearing,
stating,
“so
we
take
the
position
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
no
reasonable
alternative
between
the
finger
plan
and
the
board
plan.”
the
alternative
suggested
here
or
portions
thereof
are
unreasonable
and
it
was
referring
to
the
hew
plan.
and
this
places
the
board
and
the
plaintiffs
in
a
difficult
position
of
seeing
a
situation
where
an
appellate
court
has
ruled
one
plan
doesn't
go
for
enough
and
the
other
plan
goes
too
far.
we
feel
this
is
where
the
chips
in
this
case
fall,
there
is
no
middle
ground.
we
note
that
the
government
suggests
that
the
same
devices
used
to
create
a
segregated
system
may
be
used
to
disestablishing.
we
agree
and
go
further.
nothing
limits
this
court
or
the
federal
courts
to
these
same
devices.
the
court
might
use
these
or
more
or
different
ones
or
combinations.
the
school
board,
the
government
and
now
the
amici,
who
have
submitted
briefs
in
this
case,
suggests
any
viable
constitutional
alternative.
the
board
and
the
government
as
we
understand
their
positions,
advocate
that
some
non
standard
discretion
be
vested
in
the
school
boards
to
allow
them
to
offer
such
desegregation
as
they
deem
feasible
and
to
do
so,
when
they
think
the
time
is
appropriate.
we
do
not
think
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
black
children
in
this
system
should
be
left
to
the
whims
of
what
school
board
officials
happen
to
be
elected.
the
constitution
would
be
a
mere
mockery
if
such
were
the
case.
nor
do
we
feel
that
the
alleged
preference
for
neighborhood
schools,
which
would
preserve
racial
segregation,
is
an
acceptable
premise
upon
which
to
deny
constitutional
rights
to
the
children
in
the
system.
our
record
demonstrates
as
does
it
--
does
the
record
in
mobile,
that
neighborhood
schools
became
prominent
vogue
only
when
school
districts
were
being
required
to
desegregate.
additionally,
one
cannot
auger
that
there
is
any
less
neighborhood
under
the
plan
directed
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
than
that
proposed
by
the
school
board,
and
indeed
by
the
government.
as
we
have
shown,
the
only
difference
between
the
junior
high
school
plan
directed
by
the
district
court,
and
that
proposed
by
the
school
board,
is
the
board's
connecting
narrow
links
attempting
to
preserve
its
standard
of
contiguous
grids.
even
the
alleged
to
preference
of
government
for
a
contiguous
pairing
or
districts
is
equally
illusory.
for
the
contiguous
pairing
or
districts
for
neighborhoods
under
the
government
standard,
does
no
more
than
link
areas
which
are
unconnected
under
the
plan
directed
by
the
district
court.
the
clustered
elementary
zones
under
the
district
court's
plan
merely
live
out
of
those
clusters
in
between
school
districts
that
have
already
been
desegregated.
we'd
like
to
show
one
other
example
of
that.
the
map
item
number
four
shows
the
clusters
proposed
by
hew
at
the
july
hearing.
one
example
of
that
cluster
is
zone
number
seven,
which
is
colored
in
purple.
it
clusters
darida
(ph)
school,
state
monroe
(ph)
school
and
lincoln
high
school.
now
using
that
cluster
in
the
same
distance
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
smaller
district
is
lincoln
high
that
run
down
to
this
area.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
now
this
exhibit
here
shows
the
cluster
proposed
by
government
in
zone
number
seven
and
one
of
the
clusters
proposed
by
the
core
consultant.
the
core
consultant's
plan
is
in
black.
and
the
clusters
of
hew
are
in
red.
one
additional
example
of
how
the
core
consultant's
plan
leave
out
of
the
clusters
integrated
schools
is
the
exhibit
involving
marie
davis
and
pinewood
and
park
road
school,
which
is
shown
here
in
green.
a
cluster
proposed
by
hew
is
shown
here
in
the
overlay
in
purple,
involving
basically
these
same
schools,
the
hew
cluster
would
include
sedgefield
and
college
wood
school
which
had
been
desegregated
under
the
rezoning
plan
proposed
by
the
board.
it
would
additionally
result
in
a
predominantly
black
cluster.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
attempting
to
establish
a
standard
that
would
apply
nationally.
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
sufficient
facts
before
it
at
that
time
to
adopt
such
a
standard.
i
think
that
it
set
aside
the
district
court's
plan
with
respect
to
elementary
schools
in
order
to
see
if
some
other
plan
could
be
devised
that
would
involve
less
busing.
i
think
that
when
that
matter
went
back
before
the
district
court,
including
the
plans
presented
by
the
government
and
the
other
plan
presented
by
the
minority
of
the
board,
the
court
found
that
the
extent
of
busing
involved
in
the
february
5th
order,
would
be
basically
the
same
as
any
other
plan
that
required
desegregation
of
the
schools.
the
court
found
previously,
the
district
court
that
the
school
system
could
not
be
desegregated
without
busing
students
and
continuing
to
bus
students.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
in
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
all
--
again
your
honor
the
high
school
and
the
junior
high
school
involved
two
way
busing,
because
some
of
the
students
involved
in
the
zone
areas,
for
the
black
junior
high
schools
and
the
former
black
senior
high
school
where
white
students
being
transported
into
those
formerly
black
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
reasonableness
test
begins
with
the
premise,
that
some
black
schools
can
remain
in
a
unitary
system,
it
is
general,
it
has
no
standards,
and
it
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
your
honor
that
the
green
test
begins
with
the
premise
that
schools
should
be
desegregating,
that
there
should
be
no
black
or
white
schools
but
just
schools.
i
think
this
is
the
most
important
difference
between
the
two
tests.
if
we
begin
with
the
premise
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
begins
with
the
premise
that
some
--
all
black
schools
can
remain.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
if
the
school
board
uses
“reasonable
efforts
to
desegregate
the
school.”
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
test
that
can
be
applied
uniformly
and
that
will
eliminate
protracted
litigation
for
students
to
obtain
desegregated
education.
i
think
it's
only
--
as
judge
sobeloff
stated,
just
another
device
that
will
invite
protracted
litigation
and
continued
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
would
think
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
whether
the
decision
to
discontinue
transportation
was
racially
motivated.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
can't
say
at
this
time
because
i
don't
know
the
circumstances
under
which
the
legislature
is
acting.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
there
might
be
circumstances
under
which
the
legislature
could
adopt
such
legislation.
i
think
that
in
this
case
however,
if
the
legislature
were
to
adopt
such
legislation,
solely
to
prevent
desegregation
of
the
schools
that
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
direct
that
the
legislature
continued
with
transportation.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
would
be
one
of
the
considerations
of
the
court.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
number
281
and
349,
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
directed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
adopted
a
new
reasonableness
test,
approved
the
plan
of
the
district
court
for
the
junior
and
senior
high
schools,
and
vacated
the
decision
and
directed
further
consideration
of
a
plan
for
the
elementary
schools
requiring
that
the
district
court
apply
a
reasonableness
test.
the
plaintiff's
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari,
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
number
281
on
june
30,
reinstated
the
district
court's
plan
of
desegregation
and
authorized
further
hearing
by
the
district
court
as
had
been
directed
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
district
court
conducted
further
hearings
during
july
1970.
and
on
august
3,
1970,
applying
the
fourth
circuit's
new
test
of
reasonableness
found
a
plan
and
had
directed
in
february
1970
to
be
reasonable
and
reinstated
its
february
5th
order.
the
school
board
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari
prior
to
the
decision
by
the
fourth
circuit.
this
court
granted
that
petition
on
october
6th,
along
with
the
petition
of
the
school
board
to
review
the
plan
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
junior
and
senior
high
schools
which
the
fourth
circuit
had
approved
as
reasonable.
the
court
therefore
has
before
it,
the
complete
plan
of
the
district
court
which
had
been
directed
in
february
1970,
and
re-approved
by
the
district
court
on
august
3rd,
1970.
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
can
be
sustained
under
the
equitable
discretion
of
that
court
as
authorized
by
brown.
we
submit
however,
that
the
constitutional
principles
by
which
the
district
court
was
guided
particularly
the
requirement
for
the
elimination
of
all
black
and
racially
identifiable
black
schools.
on
this
record
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we're
clearly
correct
and
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
your
honor
that
under
the
appellate
procedural
rules
for
considering
cases
on
appeal
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
or
--
to
support
the
decision
below
that
the
court
should
sustain
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
the
issues
on
this
case
are
one,
whether
the
school
board
may
continue
to
perpetuate
all
black
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
where
such
schools
have
been
created
and
fostered
by
state
acts,
and
possible
means
are
available
to
disestablish
such
schools.
secondly,
whether
the
reasonableness
test
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
would
permit
continued
operation
or
state
created,
all
black
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
although
feasible
means
are
available
to
desegregate
such
schools
is
an
acceptable
constitutional
test
to
be
applied
in
school
desegregation
cases.
the
facts
briefly
summarized
are
these.
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
alexander
v.
holmes,
county
board
of
education,
45,012
up
to
59,828
white
students
in
this
system
were
attending
all
white
or
racially
identifiable
white
schools.
16,000
of
the
24,714
black
students
were
in
all
black
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
these
students
were
attending
82
of
the
106
schools
in
the
system,
only
24
of
these
schools
were
not
racially
identifiable.
judge
sobeloff
noted
in
his
dissent
that
the
extensive
segregation
in
this
system
was
not
fortuitous
that
it
had
resulted
from
practices
of
the
school
board
which
had
interacted
with
other
governmental
discriminatory
practices.
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
black
and
white
population
in
this
system,
in
school
and
at
home,
were
virtually,
entirely
segregated.
as
the
district
court
noted,
more
black
students
were
in
segregated
schools
in
1970
than
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
1954.
the
court
had
found
in
april
of
1969,
that
schools
had
been
segregated
or
their
racial
identity
perpetuated
by
practices
and
policies
of
the
school
board.
the
board
had
located
schools,
controlled
school
size,
grade
structure,
in
order
to
maintain
segregated
schools.
the
board
had
also
controlled
school
districts
and
transportation
to
perpetuate
racially
segregated
schools.
it
is
too
late
in
the
day,
16
years
after
brown
to
now
construct
some
ingenious
device
to
avoid
the
brown
decision.
black
children
and
parents
in
charlotte
have
struggled
since
brown
and
began
in
1965,
with
litigation
in
order
to
obtain
a
decree
as
the
district
court
entered
in
this
case.
they
desired
desegregated
education
and
know
that
it
can
only
be
obtained
under
a
plan
like
the
one
directed
by
the
district
court
below.
it
would
be
a
rejection
of
the
faith
that
black
children
and
parents
have
had
in
brown,
the
hope
of
eventually
obtaining
a
desegregated
education.
for
this
court
now
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
and
now
adopt
16
years
after
brown,
a
test
that
would
sanction
the
continued
operation
of
racially
segregated
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
one
your
honor
that
has
a
substantial
disproportionate
number
of
black
students
in
the
school
and
consideration
of
the
percentage
of
black
students
in
the
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
sir.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
of
a
case
and
the
facts
in
the
case.
in
this
system
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
excess
of
50%
black
in
a
particular
school
would
make
that
school
racially
identifiable.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
this
system
your
honor,
i
think
that
90%
white
would
perhaps
or
excess
of
90%
white
would
perhaps
make
it
racially
identifiable.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
this
system
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
district
court
was
basically
concerned
with
the
racially
identifiable
black
schools,
but
in
the
november
decision
of
the
district
court,
which
appears
on
page
655
of
the
appendix,
the
court
sets
out
the
schools
that
considers
to
be
racially
identifiable
white
and
racially
identifiable
black,
this
appears
on
page
660a,
and
here
the
court
says
that
schools
that
are
86
to
89%
white
or
higher
are
considered
racially
identifiable
white.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
86%,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
50%
black
or
higher.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
did
not
have
segregated
schools?
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
in
this
system
that
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct.
and
that
the
practices
of
the
board
which
perpetuated
the
segregated
system
continued
down
through
the
present
act.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
segregated
school
system
considered
by
the
district
court
below
was
the
result
of
the
blatant
practices
of
the
school
board
designed
to
perpetuate
a
racially
segregated
system,
that
the
district
court
directed
a
plan
that
was
both
feasible
and
effective
to
a
court,
equal
educational
opportunities
to
the
black
children.
that
the
reasonableness
test
of
the
fourth
circuit
were
merely
postponed
the
enjoinment
of
constitutional
rights
by
black
children
in
the
system,
that
the
school
board,
the
federal
government
and
the
amici
who
have
submitted
briefs
in
this
matter,
offer
no
viable
alternative
constitutional
standard
to
that
--
followed
by
the
district
court
below.
and
that
this
court
should
now
clearly
announce
the
rule,
that
every
black
child
who
has
been
segregated,
or
denied
equal
educational
opportunities
by
state
practices,
is
to
be
free
from
assignment
to
identifiable
black
schools
at
every
grade
and
every
stage
of
his
educational
experience.
the
district
court
described
charlotte-mecklenburg
“the
central
city
maybe
likened
to
an
automobile
hubcap.
the
perimeter
area
to
a
wheel
and
the
county
area
to
a
rubber
tire.”
we
have
here
a
map
which
shows
the
charlotte
and
mecklenburg
county
area
that
the
court
was
concerned
with.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
alright.
the
area
the
court
was
presently
concerned
with
was
the
central
area
of
the
city,
which
the
court
likened
to
a
hubcap.
this
is
where
the
blacks
are
principally
located
in
the
city.
the
court
described
the
dividing
line
between
the
black
and
white
residents
in
the
city
as
the
north
trans-southern
railroad
line.
95%
of
the
black
residents
in
the
city
are
concentrated
in
the
small
northwestern
part
of
the
city.
the
district
court
found
and
this
finding
was
approved
by
the
fourth
circuit
that
governmental
practices
had
created
and
contributed
to
this
racially
segregated
patterns.
one
of
the
most
pervasive
was
the
practice
of
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education,
both
before
and
after
1954.
both
before
and
after
1954,
the
board
located
schools
and
controlled
school
sites
to
perpetuate
segregation.
several
all
black
and
all
white
schools
have
been
built
and/or
have
had
additions
since
1954.
the
board
limited
the
capacities
of
schools,
controlled
grade
structure
and
school
districts
and
used
transportation
to
perpetuate
segregation.
the
district
court
found
that
the
board
had
limited
and
controlled
school
sizes
and
districts
to
perpetuate
segregation,
and
of
the
23,600
students
transported
in
this
system
in
1969
and
1970,
only
541
were
transported
to
black
schools.
the
court
further
considered
the
governmental
practices,
which
had
contributed
to
the
segregated
housing
pattern.
the
court
considered
the
urban
renewal
program,
public
housing,
zoning,
city
planning,
streets
and
highways,
and
private
discrimination.
all
of
these
practices
had
interacted
and
created
or
fostered
the
segregated
system
that
was
before
the
district
court.
additionally,
state
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions,
which
the
district
court
collected
in
its
august
3rd
opinion
all
contributed
to
the
segregated
system.
the
fourth
circuit
found
compelling
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
governmentally
created
segregated
schools
and
housing,
and
accepted
the
district
court's
findings
on
the
traditional
practices
of
appellate
review.
the
government
concedes
these
findings
and
indeed
asserts
that
these
practices,
particularly
those
of
the
school
board
contribute
it
to
the
segregated
system.
we
have
therefore
an
(inaudible)
state
action
case,
no
different
from
that
considered
by
the
court
in
brown.
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
district
court
was
constitutionally
obligated
to
direct
preparation
and
implementation
of
a
plan
that
would
disestablish
the
segregated
schools
root
and
branch.
the
district
court
sought
to
do
this
by
directing
the
board
to
prepare
such
a
plan.
on
three
occasions,
the
board
simply
refused
to
submit
a
plan
which
would
discharge
its
constitutional
obligation.
in
december,
in
default
by
the
board,
the
district
court
appointed
an
educational
consultant
to
assist
the
court
in
preparing
a
plan.
the
court
directed
that
the
consultant
followed
such
techniques
as
were
necessary
to
disestablish
the
all
black
schools
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools.
the
court
set
forth
19
principles
to
govern
the
court
consultant.
we
submit
that
the
principles
set
forth
were
clearly
within
the
discretionary
authority
of
the
court,
seeking
to
fashion
an
equitable
remedy.
this
is
particularly
true
where
the
party
principally
responsible
has
failed
to
discharge
its
obligation.
the
problem
facing
the
consultant
were
these,
one
senior
high
school,
four
junior
high
schools
and
17
elementary
schools
were
all
black.
the
concentration
of
negro
students,
and
these
schools
was
in
a
triangle,
roughly
four
or
five
miles
on
each
side.
nearly
two
third
or
16,000
of
the
black
students
were
concentrated
in
these
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor,
we
have
a
diagram
here
which
shows
the
concentration
of
these
schools
and
the
north-south
dividing
line
that
the
court
mentioned.
this
line
running
through
here
is
the
north
tryon
street,
and
it
picks
up
the
southern
railroad.
this
line
running
here
is
trade
street
which
the
district
court
mentioned
in
this
order.
the
concentration
of
the
black
students
were
in
this
triangle,
from
billingsville
school
up
to
the
northwestern
part
of
the
city
over
to
william
school
and
then
back
down
to
the
billingsville
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
a
traced
from
the
map
presented
here.
and
as
the
court
found,
sides
running
along
this
triangle
were
four
or
five
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
was
addressing
my
answer
to
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
depend
again
on
the
circumstances
of
a
case
and
as
we
defined
racially
identifiable
school
and
would
be
one
where
the
concentration
of
black
students
is
substantially
disproportioned
to
the
percentage
of
black
and
white
students
in
the
system.
now
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
would
agree
your
honor
provided
that
there
are
plans
available
which
can
be
implemented
to
eliminate
that
disproportionate
representation.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
for
racial
balance
as
we
understand
both
the
board
and
the
government
to
be
saying.
we
tried
to
set
that
forth
in
a
reply
brief
to
the
government's
brief.
we
are
asking
for
a
plan
that
would
disestablish
the
racial
identity
of
all
schools
in
the
system,
in
a
segregated
system.
and
we
think
that
particularly
in
this
system
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
we
have
a
plan
that
can
disestablish
all
racially
identifiable
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
i
do
your
honor.
the
fourth
circuit
begun
this
test
and
i
might
say
that
this
is
basically
the
test
that
is
proposed
by
the
government.
with
the
statement
that
some
schools
can
remain
all
black
or
segregated
in
a
unitary
system.
it
talks
about
the
limits
that
might
be
imposed
and
the
test
that
we
are
proposing
is
one
that
would
begin
with
the
assumption
that
all
schools
can
be
desegregated
and
would
require
that
these
schools
be
desegregated
unless
no
plan
would
be
workable
or
could
possibly
be
implemented.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
for
an
absolute
ratio
or
percentage
in
each
school.
we're
arguing
only
for
a
test
that
would
require
no
substantial
disproportionate
representation
or
concentration
of
black
students
in
a
particular
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
can't
say
because
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
could
be
a
factor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
have
some
difficulty
with
the
neighborhood
school
but
if
the
students
are
assigned
according
to
non-racial
district
lines
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
all
the
factors
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
it
might
but
again
i'm
talking
about
hypothetical
that
i
can't
really
discuss
because
it
would
all
depend
on
what
the
facts
and
the
situation
would
be.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
that
again
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
and
facts.
it
might
but
with
all
the
factors
that
the
court
should
consider,
it
might
be
that
all
the
students
could
be
assigned
to
schools
without
any
substantial
disproportionate
representation
of
blacks
in
any
school
or
concentration.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
would
say
however
that
as
the
district
court
sought
to
do
here
that
it
might
be
an
ideal
objective
that
a
district
court
or
a
school
board
might
use
in
its
discretion
to
prepare
a
plan.
the
district
court
sought
to
direct
the
plan
that
would
utilize
the
various
techniques
that
had
been
utilized
by
the
board
in
preserving
segregation.
this
board
has
transported
23,600
students
during
the
1969-70
school
year,
an
additional
5,000
students
rode
city
buses
at
reduced
fares,
55%
or
670,000
students
statewide
were
transported
in
north
carolina.
approximately
50%
of
these
students
in
the
state
and
in
charlotte
were
being
transported
were
elementary
students
in
grades
one
to
six.
students
were
transported
in
charlotte-mecklenburg
approximately
34
miles
ground
trip
each
day.
the
trip
averaged
one
hour
and
15
minutes,
one
way.
charlotte-mecklenburg
also
transported
approximately
700
kindergarten
and
pre-school
students
ages
4
to
five
years
of
age
from
7
to
39
miles,
one
way
each
day.
the
average
cost
for
transporting
students
was
$20
per
students
per
year
or
22
cents
per
day.
transportation
had
been
previously
used
to
accommodate
and
perpetuate
segregation.
the
district
court
felt
that
they
might
also
--
that
transportation
might
also
be
used
in
order
to
desegregate
the
schools.
charlotte-mecklenburg
does
not
adhere
to
any
neighborhood
concept,
the
extensive
transportation
in
the
system
refute
any
such
notion,
nor
is
the
board
proposing
such
now,
particularly
with
the
high
schools
and
junior
high
schools,
the
basic
difference
between
the
plan
proposed
by
the
board
and
that
ordered
by
the
court
is
the
lack
of
contiguous
links
or
connecting
grids
in
the
court's
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
the
majority
of
the
23,000
students
transported
were
in
the
county,
the
5,000
students
being
transported
by
city
buses
were
in
the
city.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
public
transportation,
that's
correct.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
majority
of
them
were
out
in
the
county.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor
but
one
revealing
fact
in
this
record
is
that
the
school
board
had
purposely
located
white
schools,
so
that
they
would
require
transportation,
they
were
away
from
black
neighborhoods
and
as
i
indicated
among
the
goal
of
the
23,000
students
transported,
only
541
were
black.
so
the
schools
were
purposely
located,
so
that
23,000
students
being
transported
would
be
in
the
county
and
majority
white.
we
would
like
to
show
the
court
another
exhibit
that
we
prepared
from
the
map
of
the
school
board,
showing
that
there
is
basically
no
difference
between
the
plan
proposed
by
the
board
and
that
ordered
by
the
court
for
the
junior
high
schools.
this
is
a
map
prepared
by
the
board
for
the
junior
high
schools
limited
the
zones
to
contiguous
grids
within
the
map.
they
resulted
in
odd
shaped
district
zones
as
the
district
court
noted.
the
map
prepared
by
the
court
consultant
which
the
school
board
elected
to
implement
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
as
of
february
2nd
1970.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct,
yes.
and
it
resulted
in
junior
high
school
remaining
90%
black
and
that's
piedmont
junior
high
school
which
is
in
the
inner
city.
the
court
offered
the
board
four
alternatives
in
order
to
desegregate
that
school.
the
court
said
that
the
board
could
rezone
piedmont
district,
it
could
close
piedmont
school,
it
could
pirate
or
it
could
adopt
the
plan
proposed
by
the
court
consultant.
the
court
consultant
proposed
the
plan
that
to
establish
satellite
districts,
non-satellite
districts
were
established
for
the
junior
high
school
and
the
colors
on
the
map
show
that
the
school
district
that
the
satellite
has
been
established
for,
the
blue
school
district
in
the
center
for
instance,
is
set
up
to
be
satellite
to
eastway
junior
high
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
only
one
way.
but
i
should
point
out
however
that
in
the
zone
lines
that
were
retained
under
the
court
consultant
plan,
some
white
students
are
being
transported
into
the
formerly
all
black
junior
high
school,
and
jt
williams
is
an
example.
in
order
to
desegregate
jt
williams
school
which
is
in
the
intercity,
the
school
board
had
to
carry
its
lines
out
into
the
county
to
get
some
white
residents
to
bring
them
into
jt
william
school.
but
the
satellite
districts
that
were
established
by
the
court
consultant
involved
only
one
way
busing,
that's
black
students
being
transported
out
to
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
alright.
these
(inaudible)
white
schools.
and
to
show
the
similarity
between
the
plans
of
the
core
consultant
and
the
school
board,
we
have
a
diagram
here
of
eastway
junior
high
school,
and
as
i
mentioned
the
intercity
blue
satellite
is
satellite
to
eastway
junior
high
school.
it's
shown
there
on
the
diagram
in
black,
the
red
zone,
the
red
lines
show
the
zones
for
the
junior
high
school
of
the
board.
the
black
shows
the
satellite
district
and
the
school
that
the
satellite
district
serves.
the
smith
junior
high
school
is
another
example.
the
black
again
shows
the
satellite
district
and
the
satellite
school.
the
red
zone
is
a
line
for
--
that
was
proposed
by
the
school
board.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
in
some
areas,
the
students
were
previously
assigned
to
either
northwest
junior
high
school,
an
all
black
school
or
piedmont
junior
high
school
or
jt
williams.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
satellite
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
way
the
satellite
districts
are
proposed
here,
no
junior
high
school
is
in
the
satellite
area.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
anymore.
correct.
the
other
example
that
we
have
is
cochrane
junior
high
school
in
ag
--
alexander
graham
junior
high
school.
again,
the
satellite
districts
are
shown
in
black
and
the
board's
plan
is
shown
in
red.
the
one
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
satellite,
your
honor
is
a
non-contiguous
zone
established
to
serve
a
school
district.
for
instance,
the
satellite
district
here
would
be
the
black
zone,
which
is
not
contiguous
to
the
black
zones
around
cochrane
junior
high
school.
as
the
court
point
out
in
this
opinion
also,
the
efforts
of
the
school
board
to
use
contiguous
grids,
ignore
the
traffic
arteries.
the
grid
zones
that
the
board
sought
to
adhere
to
ran
diagonally
to
the
traffic.
both
the
superintendent
of
schools
and
the
core
consultant
said
that
the
plan
directed
by
the
court,
or
the
core
consultant
plan
would
be
much
easier
to
implement.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
shortened
the
traffic
time
and
it
was
also
easier
to
implement
because
we
had
the
traffic
arteries
that
were
considered
by
the
core
consultant
in
proposing
the
satellite
districts.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
your
honor
because
the
satellite
districts
used
the
traffic
arteries
where
the
zone
lines,
the
contiguous
zones
did
not.
some
students,
for
instance,
in
the
(inaudible)
proposed
by
the
board
would
not
even
be
on
a
street
that
could
be
serviceable
for
the
school
to
which
the
students
were
assigned.
this
is
equally
true
of
the
elementary
schools.
the
board
proposed
again
to
adhere
to
contiguous
zones.
it
also
proposed
to
limit
the
schools
that
white
students
could
be
assigned
to,
to
schools
having
60%
or
more
white
students.
the
plan
proposed
by
the
board
would
leave
nine
elementary
schools,
90%
or
more
black.
the
plan
proposed
by
the
core
consultant
did
not
limit
itself
to
contiguous
zones.
the
core
consultant
clustered
ten
black
elementary
schools,
with
24
white
elementary
schools.
again,
the
core
consultant
was
utilizing
devices
that
had
been
used
by
the
board
to
preserve
the
segregated
system.
the
core
consultant
stated
that
the
clustered
schools
were
purposely
arranged
along
arterial
routes,
so
that
the
students
could
easily
be
transported
to
the
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
comparing
has
been
used
to
describe
the
consolidation
of
two
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
with
two
way
movement.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
clustering
means
the
pairing
of
one
might
use
that
were
a
grouping
of
three
or
more
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
it's
possible
your
honor,
or
you
might
use
the
school
district
that
is
not
contiguous
with
the
school
district
that
is
the
--
as
used
in
the
question.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no,
we're
talking
about
numbers
of
schools
for
pairing,
and
we're
talking
about
an
increased
number
of
schools
for
clustering.
in
the
plan
here
for
instance
that
was
proposed
by
the
core
consultant,
the
color
show
the
schools
that
are
clustered.
for
instance,
the
blue
cluster
in
the
intercity
is
lincoln
high
school,
and
it's
clustered
--
lincoln
high
school.
and
it's
clustered
with
mary
oaks
and
8
mile
road
(ph)
and
ottawa
school.
so
we
have
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
have
three
--
well
the
three
white
schools
clustered
with
one
black
school.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
are
all
either
two
white
and
one
black
or
three
white
and
one
black
school.
i
don't
think
either
one
involves
more
than
three
white
schools.
another
example
of
the
cluster
is
the
university
park
elementary
school
which
is
clustered
with
ray
marold
(ph)
and
montclair
elementary
school
and
they
are
shown
in
red.
and
as
the
core
consultant
stated,
these
schools
are
all
arranged
on
traffic
arteries,
so
that
the
students
can
be
easily
transported
to
and
from
the
elementary
schools,
and
the
cluster
is
taking
consideration
of
the
size
of
the
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
the
way
we
have
been
using
the
term.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well,
they
can
be
contiguous.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
you
mean
from
school
to
school,
or
from
the
outer
limits
of
the
perimeter.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
according
to
the
information
supplied
by
the
board,
at
the
february
--
at
the
july
1970
hearing,
the
longest
distance
in
any
of
the
clusters
would
be
12
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
but
the
board
was
measuring
from
the
outer
edge
of
the
boundary
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
boundary
of
the
school
that
was
involved.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
have
the
maximum
distance
from
school
to
school
in
that
cluster.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it's
less
than
12
miles.
and
in
addition
your
honor,
the
court
found
that
the
average
distance
that
the
student
would
be
transported
in
all
of
the
clusters
would
be
seven
miles.
and
it
would
take
35
minutes,
and
this
is
far
less
than
the
average
of
the
students
that
are
being
transported
in
the
system
today
or
in
1969-70.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
the
court
found
that
the
average
mile
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
have
the
actual
maximum
distance,
but
one
of
the
exhibits
that
we
produce
show
that
some
students
transported
as
much
as
three
-and-a-half
hours,
one
way.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
hours.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes.
one
way.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
know
the
mileage
of
that
your
honor,
as
shown
on
an
exhibit
that
was
produced
that
the
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
it
would
be
less
than
90
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
don't
know
the
exact
mileage
that
was
involved
in
that
but
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
within
the
schools
affected,
the
maximum
mileage
according
to
the
information
supplied
by
the
board
was
12.5
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
yes
sir.
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
other
23,000
students.
the
plan
that
was
directed
by
the
district
court
did
not
affect
the
majority
of
the
23,000
students
who
were
previously
transferred
or
transported.
they
were
in
the
areas,
that
are
marked
in
white
or
they
have
not
been
colored.
the
plan
that
the
district
court
ordered
for
the
elementary
schools
particularly,
involved
only
the
colored
zones.
the
core
consultant
used
the
zones
for
the
other
schools
that
were
not
involved
in
clusters.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
do
not
have
before
me
your
honor,
the
maximum
miles
that
students
were
transported
previously.
the
longest
distance
--
it
is
in
an
exhibit
that
we
introduced
at
the
march
1970
hearing.
it's
the
same
exhibit
that
shows
that
the
students
were
transported.
some
students
were
transported
three
hours
and
a
half.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
can't
say
the
maximum
difference
between
the
old
and
the
new
because
i
don't
know
the
maximum
distance
previously.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
average
previously
was
15
--
was
17
miles.
the
average
under
the
order
directed
by
the
district
court
is
seven
miles.
i
don't
know
the
longest
mile
previously
but
the
longest
mile
under
the
plan
directed
by
the
district
court,
was
12.5
miles.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
well
your
honor
as
the
district
court
found,
the
students
involved
in
the
plan
directed
by
the
court
were
being
transported
less
distance
and
at
less
time
than
previously
existed
in
the
system.
now,
we
do
not
have
or
i
don't
have
today
the
longest
distance
that
was
involved
under
the
old
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
we
will
be
glad
to
supply
the
court
with
it.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
issue
or
basic
issue
involved
is
whether
a
school
board
can
continue
to
perpetuate
segregated
schools,
where
these
schools
have
been
created
by
state
practices
or
state
action.
when
a
feasible
plan
is
available
to
disestablish
the
segregated
schools.
basically,
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
in
its
reasonableness
test,
that
some
schools
can
be
maintained
segregated
in
a
unitary
system.
we
submit
that
they
cannot
be.
we
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
a
feasible
plan
that
will
desegregate
the
schools,
and
that
the
district
court
was
properly
correct
in
saying
that
all
black
schools
or
racially
identifiable
black
schools
in
this
system
should
be
eliminated.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
from
the
point
of
view
of
students.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
under
the
plan
directed
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
no
your
honor,
there
isn't.
we
contend
and
submit
that
that
provision
or
that
kind
of
a
provision
will
not
satisfy
the
board's
requirement
to
desegregate
the
schools.
it
is
a
provision
that
the
government
advocate
should
be
included
on
the
plan,
where
segregated
schools
are
retained.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
was
on
the
board's
plan
too.
but
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
the
board
had
imposed
limitations
on
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
be
unacceptable.
we
think
that
under
the
plan
that
the
district
court
has
directed
that
we
can
eliminate
all
black
and
racially
identifiable
black
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that
blacks
are
interested
in
the
plan
being
implemented.
i
represent
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
your
honor
under
the
plan
directed,
there
wouldn't
be
any
black
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
plan.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
this
court
has
answered
that
question
several
times.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
my
answer
is
the
same
as
this
court
that
the
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that
the
school
board
and
the
court
might
legitimately
consider
race
and
has
to
consider
race
in
order
to
desegregate
a
school
system.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
this
court
has
said
that
in
green.
the
school
board
cannot
be
neutral.
it
has
created
a
segregated
system
and
it
has
to
now
consider
race
to
disestablish
it.
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
it,
said
it
in
weiner
(ph)
versus
the
arlington
school
board.
there
the
school
board
had
to
consider
race
in
order
to
desegregate
and
i
think
that
it's
absolutely
necessary
here
that
the
court
consider
race
to
desegregating.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
constitution
requires
that
school
boards
disestablish
or
dismantle
segregated
schools
that
they
have
created.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
an
equitable
remedy,
that
the
court
can
utilize
devices
that
have
been
used
by
school
officials
to
create
a
segregated
system.
i
think
further
that
the
school
board
and
the
court
are
not
limited
to
the
same
devices
that
have
been
used
to
create
a
segregated
system
but
can
go
use
other
devices
that
are
necessary
to
desegregate,
if
this
requires
busing
and
it
has
been
in
this
system
in
the
past
--
busing
has
been
used
in
the
past
to
segregate,
then
the
court
can
use
busing
in
order
to
desegregate.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
the
rule
would
be
a
bit
more
general,
that
being
that
the
court
--
the
board
would
have
to
use
what
means
were
necessary
which
would
require
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
if
it
would
require
busing,
then
i
think
that
the
constitution
will
require
that
the
board
utilize
the
facilities
to
do
so,
to
desegregate.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
the
constitution
requires
--
i
think
that
the
court
should
require
the
school
board
to
do
what
is
necessary
and
i
think
the
constitution
requires
that.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
this
way,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far
to
affirm
what
the
district
court
did
below.
i
think
however,
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
it
should
be
required.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
district
court
estimated,
it
would
be
138
buses.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
and
money
was
available
and
in
fact
the
court
found
below
that
no
additional
capital
outlay
was
necessary
in
order
to
desegregate
now.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
the
board
has
available
over
107
buses
which
the
district
court
found,
additionally
the
states
had
advised
the
board
that
it
would
loan
buses
to
it
which
the
board
would
have
to
replace
either
due
on
the
school
year
or
next
year.
and
in
fact
that's
what
i
understand
has
been
done.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i'm
not
arguing
that
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
might
be
permissible
under
some
circumstances.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
green
said
that.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
correct.
the
test
proposed
by
the
government
and
by
the
school
board,
we
submit
is
unworkable
and
vague.
16
years
of
litigation
have
taught
us
that
vague
standards
and
test
of
good
faith
of
school
boards,
merely
prolong
the
day
that
black
children
are
able
to
enjoy
equal
educational
opportunities.
this
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
the
argument
advanced
by
the
school
board.
while
advocating
a
reasonableness
test,
the
board
contends
at
the
fourth
circuit
doesn't
know
how
to
apply
its
own
test,
because
the
fourth
circuit
was
sustaining
the
district
court's
order
with
respect
to
the
junior
and
senior
high
schools.
this
is
further
demonstrated
by
the
recent
case
considered
by
the
fourth
circuit
only
a
few
days
after
the
fourth
circuit
had
announced
its
new
rule.
this
was
a
case
in
clarendon
county,
where
small
school
district
contended
that
it
could
not
desegregate
the
schools
by
using
reasonable
means.
secondly,
the
fact
of
this
case
do
not
warrant
any
standard
as
proposed
or
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit.
again
the
facts
are
simple.
we
have
a
segregated
system
created
by
the
state
practices
and
we
have
at
hands
the
means
for
desegregation.
the
school
board
concedes
that
if
it
is
required
to
afford
black
children
in
the
system
and
equal
educational
opportunity
then
the
plan
directed
by
district
court
is
the
one
that
should
be
followed.
mr.
wagner,
my
opposing
counsel
reaffirmed
that
position
only
recently,
when
it
argued
before
the
district
court
during
july
1970
hearing,
stating,
“so
we
take
the
position
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
no
reasonable
alternative
between
the
finger
plan
and
the
board
plan.”
the
alternative
suggested
here
or
portions
thereof
are
unreasonable
and
it
was
referring
to
the
hew
plan.
and
this
places
the
board
and
the
plaintiffs
in
a
difficult
position
of
seeing
a
situation
where
an
appellate
court
has
ruled
one
plan
doesn't
go
for
enough
and
the
other
plan
goes
too
far.
we
feel
this
is
where
the
chips
in
this
case
fall,
there
is
no
middle
ground.
we
note
that
the
government
suggests
that
the
same
devices
used
to
create
a
segregated
system
may
be
used
to
disestablishing.
we
agree
and
go
further.
nothing
limits
this
court
or
the
federal
courts
to
these
same
devices.
the
court
might
use
these
or
more
or
different
ones
or
combinations.
the
school
board,
the
government
and
now
the
amici,
who
have
submitted
briefs
in
this
case,
suggests
any
viable
constitutional
alternative.
the
board
and
the
government
as
we
understand
their
positions,
advocate
that
some
non
standard
discretion
be
vested
in
the
school
boards
to
allow
them
to
offer
such
desegregation
as
they
deem
feasible
and
to
do
so,
when
they
think
the
time
is
appropriate.
we
do
not
think
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
black
children
in
this
system
should
be
left
to
the
whims
of
what
school
board
officials
happen
to
be
elected.
the
constitution
would
be
a
mere
mockery
if
such
were
the
case.
nor
do
we
feel
that
the
alleged
preference
for
neighborhood
schools,
which
would
preserve
racial
segregation,
is
an
acceptable
premise
upon
which
to
deny
constitutional
rights
to
the
children
in
the
system.
our
record
demonstrates
as
does
it
--
does
the
record
in
mobile,
that
neighborhood
schools
became
prominent
vogue
only
when
school
districts
were
being
required
to
desegregate.
additionally,
one
cannot
auger
that
there
is
any
less
neighborhood
under
the
plan
directed
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
than
that
proposed
by
the
school
board,
and
indeed
by
the
government.
as
we
have
shown,
the
only
difference
between
the
junior
high
school
plan
directed
by
the
district
court,
and
that
proposed
by
the
school
board,
is
the
board's
connecting
narrow
links
attempting
to
preserve
its
standard
of
contiguous
grids.
even
the
alleged
to
preference
of
government
for
a
contiguous
pairing
or
districts
is
equally
illusory.
for
the
contiguous
pairing
or
districts
for
neighborhoods
under
the
government
standard,
does
no
more
than
link
areas
which
are
unconnected
under
the
plan
directed
by
the
district
court.
the
clustered
elementary
zones
under
the
district
court's
plan
merely
live
out
of
those
clusters
in
between
school
districts
that
have
already
been
desegregated.
we'd
like
to
show
one
other
example
of
that.
the
map
item
number
four
shows
the
clusters
proposed
by
hew
at
the
july
hearing.
one
example
of
that
cluster
is
zone
number
seven,
which
is
colored
in
purple.
it
clusters
darida
(ph)
school,
state
monroe
(ph)
school
and
lincoln
high
school.
now
using
that
cluster
in
the
same
distance
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
the
smaller
district
is
lincoln
high
that
run
down
to
this
area.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
now
this
exhibit
here
shows
the
cluster
proposed
by
government
in
zone
number
seven
and
one
of
the
clusters
proposed
by
the
core
consultant.
the
core
consultant's
plan
is
in
black.
and
the
clusters
of
hew
are
in
red.
one
additional
example
of
how
the
core
consultant's
plan
leave
out
of
the
clusters
integrated
schools
is
the
exhibit
involving
marie
davis
and
pinewood
and
park
road
school,
which
is
shown
here
in
green.
a
cluster
proposed
by
hew
is
shown
here
in
the
overlay
in
purple,
involving
basically
these
same
schools,
the
hew
cluster
would
include
sedgefield
and
college
wood
school
which
had
been
desegregated
under
the
rezoning
plan
proposed
by
the
board.
it
would
additionally
result
in
a
predominantly
black
cluster.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
attempting
to
establish
a
standard
that
would
apply
nationally.
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
sufficient
facts
before
it
at
that
time
to
adopt
such
a
standard.
i
think
that
it
set
aside
the
district
court's
plan
with
respect
to
elementary
schools
in
order
to
see
if
some
other
plan
could
be
devised
that
would
involve
less
busing.
i
think
that
when
that
matter
went
back
before
the
district
court,
including
the
plans
presented
by
the
government
and
the
other
plan
presented
by
the
minority
of
the
board,
the
court
found
that
the
extent
of
busing
involved
in
the
february
5th
order,
would
be
basically
the
same
as
any
other
plan
that
required
desegregation
of
the
schools.
the
court
found
previously,
the
district
court
that
the
school
system
could
not
be
desegregated
without
busing
students
and
continuing
to
bus
students.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
it
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
in
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
all
--
again
your
honor
the
high
school
and
the
junior
high
school
involved
two
way
busing,
because
some
of
the
students
involved
in
the
zone
areas,
for
the
black
junior
high
schools
and
the
former
black
senior
high
school
where
white
students
being
transported
into
those
formerly
black
schools.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
reasonableness
test
begins
with
the
premise,
that
some
black
schools
can
remain
in
a
unitary
system,
it
is
general,
it
has
no
standards,
and
it
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
your
honor
that
the
green
test
begins
with
the
premise
that
schools
should
be
desegregating,
that
there
should
be
no
black
or
white
schools
but
just
schools.
i
think
this
is
the
most
important
difference
between
the
two
tests.
if
we
begin
with
the
premise
--
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
begins
with
the
premise
that
some
--
all
black
schools
can
remain.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
if
the
school
board
uses
“reasonable
efforts
to
desegregate
the
school.”
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
test
that
can
be
applied
uniformly
and
that
will
eliminate
protracted
litigation
for
students
to
obtain
desegregated
education.
i
think
it's
only
--
as
judge
sobeloff
stated,
just
another
device
that
will
invite
protracted
litigation
and
continued
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
would
think
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
whether
the
decision
to
discontinue
transportation
was
racially
motivated.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
your
honor
i
can't
say
at
this
time
because
i
don't
know
the
circumstances
under
which
the
legislature
is
acting.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
there
might
be
circumstances
under
which
the
legislature
could
adopt
such
legislation.
i
think
that
in
this
case
however,
if
the
legislature
were
to
adopt
such
legislation,
solely
to
prevent
desegregation
of
the
schools
that
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
direct
that
the
legislature
continued
with
transportation.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
i
think
that
would
be
one
of
the
considerations
of
the
court.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
julius
levonne
chambers
that's
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
