is
counsel
ready?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
chambers
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
to
persuade
us
mr.
chambers
that
they're
clearly
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
it
will
be
difficult
to
have
your
argument
fully
and
accurately
recorded
if
you
get
too
far
away
from
the
podium.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
map
on
the
same
scale
as
the
ones
you
used
before
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
follows
from
that
if
there
is
one
school
beyond
the
limits
that
you
proposed
then
it
is
not
unitized,
the
system
is
not
unitized.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
means
then
that
you're
arguing
for
racial
balance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
there
is
a
difference
between
feasibility
and
reasonableness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
how
would
you
apply
this
standard
to
a
city
or
an
area,
school
area
which
is
97%
whites
and
3%
negro,
do
you
mean
that
every
school,
each
school
in
that
system
must
be
roughly
97-3?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
obviously
or
i
should
think
obviously,
very
likely
in
a
97:3
ratio,
you
wouldn't
have
any
all
black
schools,
all
negro
schools
would
you
but
--
would
you
concede
that
there
might
be
some
all
white
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
on
the
location
of
the
3%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
were
scattered
evenly
through
the
total
area
then
the
natural
consequence
even
of
the
neighborhood
school
concept
would
take
care
of
it
probably,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
assuming
that
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
part
of
my
hypothesis
that
no
effort
was
made
to
direct
them
to
a
particular
place,
but
you
do
concede
that
there
would
inevitably
be
some
all
white
schools
probably
in
that
kind
of
a
system,
it
could
happen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
then
conversely,
if
you
had
a
97
negro,
3%
white,
you
then
might
again
have
unavoidably
some
all
black
isn't
that
true,
all
negro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
glean
from
your
answer,
since
you
said
depends
on
the
fact
that
you're
suggesting
that
there
is
not
an
absolute
constitutional
requirement
to
take
this
percentage
and
mechanically
put
it
in
effect
in
each
individual
school
in
the
system.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
because
the
plan,
the
second
plan
took
the
flow
of
traffic
into
account
more
realistically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
this
significantly
shorten
the
travel
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
did
shorten
the
traffic
time
significantly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
have
three
areas
in
the
cluster?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah.
but
i'm
speaking
now
just
to
geography,
when
you
speak
of
cluster,
you
mean
three
or
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
any
of
these
more
than
three?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
go
back
for
a
moment
to
that
last
clustering
that
you
were
describing
which
is
colored
in
red
on
your
map
and
approximately
it's
a
triangle.
what's
the
distance
between
the
outer
perimeter
of
those
triangles
approximately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
outer
perimeter
of
one
to
the
outer
perimeter
of
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
schools
are
not
necessarily
located
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
perimeter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
maximum
distance
between
schools
in
that
particular
instance
of
the
red
cluster?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
necessity,
it's
less
than
12
miles.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
spoke
mr.
chambers
of
devices,
various
devices
the
court
could
use,
i
got
an
implication
perhaps,
erroneously
that
a
device
such
as
such
as
freedom
of
choice
might
in
your
view
be
impermissible,
would
that
be
your
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
green
said
that,
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it,
it
depends
on
the
judge
the
tool
according
to
its
efficacy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
works,
it's
a
good
tool.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
layers
in
here
is
not
all
that
good
mr.
chambers
and
mr.
nabrit,
is
the
pairing
the
one
that
runs
right
next
to
the
orange
area?
the
pairing
of
the
small
--
take
the
smaller
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
is
the
definition
that
you
use
for
a
racially
identifiable
school?
do
you
accept,
i
believe
mr.
chambers'
definition
that
perhaps
more
than
10%,
more
than
a
variation
from
the
90-10?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
somewhere
perhaps
it
was
in
one
of
the
opinions.
is
the
standard
that
if
it
has
less
than
10%
whites,
it's
all
black,
all
negro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
this
10%
suggestion
that
appears
in
some
of
the
papers
and
some
of
the
cases
now,
addressing
myself
to
general
and
broad
propositions,
is
that
anything
10%
or
less
is
mere
tokenism,
do
you
accept
that
concept?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general
after
lunch,
it'd
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
suggest,
if
you
will,
whether
the
feasibility
test
to
green
and
the
reasonableness
test
of
the
fourth
circuit
are
different
and
if
so
in
what
respects?
i'll
give
you
the
lunch
hour
to
formulate
some
ideas
on
that.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
read
your
remand
suggestion
--
i
read
it,
i
understood
that
as
you
articulated
it
here,
the
remand
suggestion
to
judge
mcmillan
has
meaning
that
perhaps
it
was
an
error
if
he
acted
on
the
assumption
that
he
must
achieve
a
fixed
racial
balance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
he
must
eliminate
all
blacks
and
all
white
school.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
nabrit
i
--
excuse
me,
mr.
waggoner
is
going
to
be
next.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
does
this
case
address
itself,
the
case
we
are
now
arguing
address
itself
to
anything
except
duty
of
a
publicly
supported
school
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
does
this
case
direct
itself
to
a
duty
on
the
child
or
does
it
direct
itself
to
a
duty
on
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
started
out
to
tell
us
what
you
thought
were
the
crucial
issues
in
this
case,
you
said
the
first
one
is
whether
racial
balance
is
a
constitutional
imperative.
now
what's
the
second
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
situation
you
described,
i
take
it,
you
consider
an
inescapable
consequence
of
the
court's
order.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
there
a
--
i
thought
you
were
about
to
put
it
in
a
different
way?
that
if
the
pattern
is
all
fixed
in
1970
and
then
by
--
an
exodus
of
people
who
are
moving
upwards
to
take
the
phrase
used
in
many
of
the
briefs,
moving
upward
to
better
homes,
up
where
there
are
more
green
trees,
and
with
more
green
grass.
and
there
are
other
people
moving
in
so
that
the
pattern
changes,
must
you
as
a
constitutional
matter,
as
you
see
it
under
judge
mcmillan's
order,
reexamine,
rephrase,
and
then
go
through
a
process
of
reassignment
to
bring
yourselves
in
line
with
the
new
population
pattern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
a
specific
period?
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
in
north
carolina,
the
school
board
can
say
all
children
in
the
first
four
grades
must
go
to
the
school
nearest
to
them.
and
all
students
in
the
next
four
grades
should
go
wherever
they
may
be
assigned
and
yet
the
next
four
grades
in
a
larger
perimeter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
there
been
any
traditional
pattern
in
north
carolina
with
respect
to
putting
historically
--
putting
children
of
tender
years
in
one
type
of
the
school
nearby
and
children
in
older
age
in
the
schools
in
greater
distance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wagonner.
mr.
horack.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
horack.
you
have
got
about
33
minutes,
am
i
correct
in
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
indeed
every
school,
is
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
agree
mr.
justice
for
your
interpretation
that
analysis
where
judge
mcmillan
said,
but
we
can't
get
it
would
do
it
all
the
way.
but
we're
going
to
come
just
as
darn
close
to
it
as
we
can.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think,
can
you
tell
me
whether
under
not
the
north
carolina
law,
the
school
board
would
be
permitted
to
establish
a
plan
that
went
beyond
the
constitutional
requirements
but
would
be
a
plan
which
because
of
their
plenary
authority
over
schools
would
be
one
which
the
public
or
the
citizens
and
the
students
had
to
accept.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
me
test
that
with
this
question.
could
the
school
board
survive
that
all
children
in
the
first
four
grades,
irrespective
of
race,
go
to
schools
within
one
mile
from
their
residence
and
not
to
have
that
vision
with
reference
to
any
other
grades?
is
there
any
constitutional
question
involved
in
the
school
board's
right
to
do
that
or
is
that
discretionary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
irrespective
of
race.
no
racial
factor
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
constitutional
question
there,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
going
a
little
fast
for
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
first
one
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
with
that
demands
of
the
continuing
surveillance
to
maintain
substantially
the
71:29
racial
balance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
asking
you.
what
do
you
say
that
judge
mcmillan
meant?
is
that
for
just
this
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
would
continuing
control
mean?
if
it
didn't
mean
that
he
was
going
to
continue
overseeing
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
keep
your
voice
up
the
counsel
so
we'll
stay
on
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
approve
of
people
being
reasonable?
we
all
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
in
the
same
sense
that
reasonable
search
are
permitted
under
the
constitution
but
under
unreasonable
searches
are
forbidden.
is
that
the
sense
in
which
you're
using
the
term
reasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
that
is
the
point.

appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
horack.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
nabrit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
during
the
course
of
your
discourse,
it
would
help
me,
if
you
would
suggest
something
about
your
view
on
the
continuing
surveillance
nature
of
this
order
and
what
does
the
court
do
if
in
rather
say
three
years
they
find
that
pattern
of
population
has
substantially
altered
so
that
the
7131
is
no
longer
a
remedial
measure,
under
the
standards
laid
down
by
that
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
you
agree
mr.
nabrit
that
the
school
boards
like
other
bodies
can
make
honest
mistakes
of
error
in
the
size
of
the
school
that
they
plan
and
the
location
of
it
and
honest
errors
in
the
sense
that
the
future
development
of
the
community
proves
that
their
original
judgment
was
not
very
good.
now
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
that
happens
with
respect
let's
say
to
anyone
of
those
two
paired
or
three,
or
four
of
those
paired
groups
so
that
at
the
end
of
three
years,
something
that
was
substantially
71:29
now,
under
judge
mcmillan's
order,
turns
out
to
be
80:20
or
90:10,
does
the
court
have
something
like
a
reapportionment
function
to
order
the
school
board
to
redraw
its
lines
and
be
gerrymandered
so
as
to
restore
the
71:29
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
to
say
that
we
allow
the
other
side
of
the
table
about
four
minutes
extra
and
so
we'll
allow
you
to
run
till
three
o'clock
which
will
give
you
a
little
bit
more
time
in
view
of
our
balancing
of
time
problem
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
suggested
this
is
a
continuing
duty
of
the
school
board.
i
have
no
difficulty
in
that
at
all
but
certainly
that's
the
function
of
the
school
board.
is
there
a
continuing
duty
of
surveillance
with
continuing
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
once
it
has
assumed
this
function
in
the
case?
chief

i
think
your
time

up

chief

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

do
you
have
to
persuade
us
mr.

that
they're
clearly
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
it
will
be
difficult
to
have
your
argument
fully
and
accurately
recorded
if
you
get
too
far
away
from
the
podium.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
map
on
the
same
scale
as
the
ones
you
used
before
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
follows
from
that
if
there
is
one
school
beyond
the
limits
that
you
proposed
then
it
is
not
unitized,
the
system
is
not
unitized.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
means
then
that
you're
arguing
for
racial
balance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
there
is
a
difference
between
feasibility
and
reasonableness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
how
would
you
apply
this
standard
to
a
city
or
an
area,
school
area
which
is
97%
whites
and
3%
negro,
do
you
mean
that
every
school,
each
school
in
that

must
be
roughly
97-3?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
obviously
or
i
should
think
obviously,
very
likely
in
a
97:3
ratio,
you
wouldn't
have
any
all
black
schools,
all
negro
schools
would
you
but
--
would
you
concede
that
there
might
be
some
all
white
school?
chief

warren
e.

you
mean
on
the
location
of

chief

e.

(voice

chief

e.

if

then
the
natural

would
take

wouldn't
it?
chief

warren
e.

i'm
assuming
that
one.
chief

e.

a
part
of
my
hypothesis
that
no

was
made
to
direct
them
to

particular

you
do
concede
that
there
would
inevitably
be
some
all
white
schools
probably
in
that
kind
of
a
system,
it
could
happen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
then
conversely,
if
you
had
a
97
negro,
3%
white,
you
then
might
again
have
unavoidably
some
all
black
isn't
that
true,
all
negro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
glean
from
your
answer,
since
you
said
depends
on
the
fact
that
you're
suggesting
that
there
is
not
an
absolute
constitutional
requirement
to
take
this
percentage
and
mechanically
put
it
in
effect
in
each
individual
school
in
the
system.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
because
the
plan,
the
second
plan
took
the
flow
of
traffic
into
account
more
realistically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
this
significantly
shorten
the
travel
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
did
shorten
the
traffic
time
significantly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
have
three
areas
in
the
cluster?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah.
but
i'm
speaking
now
just
to
geography,
when
you
speak
of
cluster,
you
mean
three
or
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
any
of
these
more
than
three?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
go
back
for
a
moment
to
that
last
clustering
that
you
were
describing
which
is
colored
in
red
on
your
map
and
approximately
it's
a
triangle.
what's
the
distance
between
the
outer
perimeter
of
those
triangles
approximately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
outer
perimeter
of
one
to
the
outer
perimeter
of
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
schools
are
not
necessarily
located
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
perimeter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
maximum
distance
between
schools
in
that
particular
instance
of
the
red
cluster?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
necessity,
it's
less
than
12
miles.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
spoke
mr.
chambers
of
devices,
various
devices
the
court
could
use,
i
got
an
implication
perhaps,
erroneously
that
a
device
such
as
such
as
freedom
of
choice
might
in
your
view
be
impermissible,
would
that
be
your
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
green
said
that,
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it,
it
depends
on
the
judge
the
tool
according
to
its
efficacy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
works,
it's
a
good
tool.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
layers
in
here
is
not
all
that
good
mr.
chambers
and
mr.
nabrit,
is
the
pairing
the
one
that
runs
right
next
to
the
orange
area?
the
pairing
of
the
small
--
take
the
smaller
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
is
the
definition
that
you
use
for
a
racially
identifiable
school?
do
you
accept,
i
believe
mr.
chambers'
definition
that
perhaps
more
than
10%,
more
than
a
variation
from
the
90-10?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
somewhere
perhaps
it
was
in
one
of
the
opinions.
is
the
standard
that
if
it
has
less
than
10%
whites,
it's
all
black,
all
negro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
this
10%
suggestion
that
appears
in
some
of
the
papers
and
some
of
the
cases
now,
addressing
myself
to
general
and
broad
propositions,
is
that
anything
10%
or
less
is
mere
tokenism,
do
you
accept
that
concept?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general
after
lunch,
it'd
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
would
suggest,
if
you
will,
whether
the
feasibility
test
to
green
and
the
reasonableness
test
of
the
fourth
circuit
are
different
and
if
so
in
what
respects?
i'll
give
you
the
lunch
hour
to
formulate
some
ideas
on
that.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
read
your
remand
suggestion
--
i
read
it,
i
understood
that
as
you
articulated
it
here,
the
remand
suggestion
to
judge
mcmillan
has
meaning
that
perhaps
it
was
an
error
if
he
acted
on
the
assumption
that
he
must
achieve
a
fixed
racial
balance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
he
must
eliminate
all
blacks
and
all
white
school.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
nabrit
i
--
excuse
me,
mr.
waggoner
is
going
to
be
next.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
does
this
case
address
itself,
the
case
we
are
now
arguing
address
itself
to
anything
except
duty
of
a
publicly
supported
school
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
does
this
case
direct
itself
to
a
duty
on
the
child
or
does
it
direct
itself
to
a
duty
on
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
started
out
to
tell
us
what
you
thought
were
the
crucial
issues
in
this
case,
you
said
the
first
one
is
whether
racial
balance
is
a
constitutional
imperative.
now
what's
the
second
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
situation
you
described,
i
take
it,
you
consider
an
inescapable
consequence
of
the
court's
order.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
there
a
--
i
thought
you
were
about
to
put
it
in
a
different
way?
that
if
the
pattern
is
all
fixed
in
1970
and
then
by
--
an
exodus
of
people
who
are
moving
upwards
to
take
the
phrase
used
in
many
of
the
briefs,
moving
upward
to
better
homes,
up
where
there
are
more
green
trees,
and
with
more
green
grass.
and
there
are
other
people
moving
in
so
that
the
pattern
changes,
must
you
as
a
constitutional
matter,
as
you
see
it
under
judge
mcmillan's
order,
reexamine,
rephrase,
and
then
go
through
a
process
of
reassignment
to
bring
yourselves
in
line
with
the
new
population
pattern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
a
specific
period?
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
in
north
carolina,
the
school
board
can
say
all
children
in
the
first
four
grades
must
go
to
the
school
nearest
to
them.
and
all
students
in
the
next
four
grades
should
go
wherever
they
may
be
assigned
and
yet
the
next
four
grades
in
a
larger
perimeter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
there
been
any
traditional
pattern
in
north
carolina
with
respect
to
putting
historically
--
putting
children
of
tender
years
in
one
type
of
the
school
nearby
and
children
in
older
age
in
the
schools
in
greater
distance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wagonner.
mr.
horack.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
horack.
you
have
got
about
33
minutes,
am
i
correct
in
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
indeed
every
school,
is
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
agree
mr.
justice
for
your
interpretation
that
analysis
where
judge
mcmillan
said,
but
we
can't
get
it
would
do
it
all
the
way.
but
we're
going
to
come
just
as
darn
close
to
it
as
we
can.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think,
can
you
tell
me
whether
under
not
the
north
carolina
law,
the
school
board
would
be
permitted
to
establish
a
plan
that
went
beyond
the
constitutional
requirements
but
would
be
a
plan
which
because
of
their
plenary
authority
over
schools
would
be
one
which
the
public
or
the
citizens
and
the
students
had
to
accept.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
me
test
that
with
this
question.
could
the
school
board
survive
that
all
children
in
the
first
four
grades,
irrespective
of
race,
go
to
schools
within
one
mile
from
their
residence
and
not
to
have
that
vision
with
reference
to
any
other
grades?
is
there
any
constitutional
question
involved
in
the
school
board's
right
to
do
that
or
is
that
discretionary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
irrespective
of
race.
no
racial
factor
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
constitutional
question
there,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
going
a
little
fast
for
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
first
one
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
with
that
demands
of
the
continuing
surveillance
to
maintain
substantially
the
71:29
racial
balance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
asking
you.
what
do
you
say
that
judge
mcmillan
meant?
is
that
for
just
this
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
would
continuing
control
mean?
if
it
didn't
mean
that
he
was
going
to
continue
overseeing
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
keep
your
voice
up
the
counsel
so
we'll
stay
on
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
approve
of
people
being
reasonable?
we
all
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
in
the
same
sense
that
reasonable
search
are
permitted
under
the
constitution
but
under
unreasonable
searches
are
forbidden.
is
that
the
sense
in
which
you're
using
the
term
reasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
is
the
point.
1267-a
in
the
appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
horack.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
nabrit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
during
the
course
of
your
discourse,
it
would
help
me,
if
you
would
suggest
something
about
your
view
on
the
continuing
surveillance
nature
of
this
order
and
what
does
the
court
do
if
in
rather
say
three
years
they
find
that
pattern
of
population
has
substantially
altered
so
that
the
7131
is
no
longer
a
remedial
measure,
under
the
standards
laid
down
by
that
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
you
agree
mr.
nabrit
that
the
school
boards
like
other
bodies
can
make
honest
mistakes
of
error
in
the
size
of
the
school
that
they
plan
and
the
location
of
it
and
honest
errors
in
the
sense
that
the
future
development
of
the
community
proves
that
their
original
judgment
was
not
very
good.
now
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
that
happens
with
respect
let's
say
to
anyone
of
those
two
paired
or
three,
or
four
of
those
paired
groups
so
that
at
the
end
of
three
years,
something
that
was
substantially
71:29
now,
under
judge
mcmillan's
order,
turns
out
to
be
80:20
or
90:10,
does
the
court
have
something
like
a
reapportionment
function
to
order
the
school
board
to
redraw
its
lines
and
be
gerrymandered
so
as
to
restore
the
71:29
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
to
say
that
we
allow
the
other
side
of
the
table
about
four
minutes
extra
and
so
we'll
allow
you
to
run
till
three
o'clock
which
will
give
you
a
little
bit
more
time
in
view
of
our
balancing
of
time
problem
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
suggested
this
is
a
continuing
duty
of
the
school
board.
i
have
no
difficulty
in
that
at
all
but
certainly
that's
the
function
of
the
school
board.
is
there
a
continuing
duty
of
surveillance
with
continuing
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
once
it
has
assumed
this
function
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
mr.
nabrit.
thank
you
for
your
submission.
thank
you
gentlemen.
