mr.
arnold
ordman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
consolidated
here
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
broad
terms,
the
questions
presented
in
both
these
cases
is
whether
the
union,
local
825,
of
the
operating
engineers
violated
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
so-called
secondary
boycott
provision
by
exerting
coercive
pressures
upon
neutral
employers
in
support
of
its
dispute
with
the
primary
employer,
the
white
construction
company.
now,
that
question
can
be
further
refined.
all
parties
and
the
board
and
the
court
below
are
in
agreement
here
that
the
union
did
exert
coercive
pressures
as
defined
by
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
upon
neutral
employers.
now,
that
statutory
section
further
requires,
for
purposes
relevant
here,
that
such
coercive
conduct
have,
as
an
object,
forcing
or
requiring
an
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
now,
this
is
the
pivotal
issue
in
the
case.
the
board
found
that
the
union’s
coercive
conduct
had
cessation
of
business
as
it
read
the
statute,
in
the
statutory
sense,
as
an
object
of
its
conduct
and
the
board,
therefore,
found
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b).
the
court
below
disagreed.
unlike
the
board
and
unlike
other
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
this
issue,
the
court
below
reads
the
language
in
the
statute
quite
literally.
on
the
basis
of
that
literal
reading,
the
court
below
held
that
the
proof
was
insufficient
to
prove
that
the
union
had
an
object
to--
had
a
“seize
doing
business”
object
because
the
union
did
not,
as
the
court
saw
the
case,
ask
for
a
total
cessation
of
business.
now,
the
underlying
facts
on
at
issue,
the
instant
labor
dispute
arose
at
a
construction
site
in
oyster
creek,
new
jersey
where
a
burns
&
roe,
inc.,
a
general
contractor,
was
building
a
$68-billion
nuclear
power
plant
for
the
jersey
central
power
and
light
company.
burns
&
roe,
the
general
contractor
in
charge
of
this
project,
had
no
employees
of
its
own.
it
delegated
all
the--
no
construction
workers.
it
delegated
all
the
construction
work
to
three
subcontractors,
the
white
construction
company,
the
chicago
bridge,
and--
iron
company,
and
the
poirier
&
mclane
corporation.
now,
all
these
three
subcontractors
had,
among
their
employees,
members
of
the
local
825
operating
engineers
union.
local
825
had
contracts
with
two
of
the
subcontractors,
chicago
bridge
and
poirier.
it
had
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
either
burns,
the
general
contractor,
or
with
the
white
construction
company.
now,
white’s
job,
one
of
the
three
subcontractors,
its
job
under
its
subcontractor
was
to
build
this
nuclear
power
plant,
to
create
the
reactor
building
for
the
nuclear
power
plant,
and
white’s
equipment
included,
among
other
things,
a
piece
of
equipment
known
as
an
electrical
welding
machine.
and,
as
soon
as
white
got
the
subcontract,
he
assigned
the
operation
of
this
electrical
welding
machine,
including--
starting
on
stopping
the
machine
to
employees
of
his
who
were
members
of
the
iron
workers
union
and
local
825,
the
operating
engineers
union,
who
wanted
that
work
and
urged
upon
white
that
employees
of
white
who
were
members
of
local
825
of
operating
engineers
be
given
the
job
of
pushing
the
buttons
which
started
and
stopped
the
welding
machine.
now,
local
825,
as
i
pointed
out,
didn’t
have
contracts
with
white,
this
subcontractor,
or
with
the
general
contractor
but,
in
support
of
its
demand,
they
presented
profit
agreements
to
white
and
to
burns.
as--
in
effect,
those
agreements
would
commit
white,
the
subcontractor,
and
the
general
contractor
to
give
all
power
equipment
including
specifically
welding
machines
and
give
that
jurisdiction
to
the
operating
engineers.
now,
these
agreements
would
not
only
have
bound
the
signatory,
white,
who
was
doing
that
work,
it
also
bound
subcontractors
of
the
signatory
so
that
burns
&
roe,
the
general
contractor,
would
have
been
bound
to
apply
that
subcontract
to
white
who
was
a
subcontractor.
now,
neither
white
nor
burns
agreed
to
sign
or
yielded
to
this
pressure
to
sign
the
agreements.
now,
while
this
dispute
was
going
on,
since
all
the
parties
involved
had
agreed
that
disputes
of
this
kind,
really
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
should
be
submitted
to
the
national
joint
board
for
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes.
the
dispute
was
submitted
around
october
6th
and,
within
a
couple
of
weeks,
the
national
joint
board
for
the
settlement
of--
i
think
it
used
to
be
called
the
dunlop
board,
settled
this
dispute
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
iron
workers
to
whom
white
had
given
the
work.
but,
the
operating
engineers
weren’t
satisfied.
they
didn’t
submit.
they
refused
to
comply
with
that
submission,
with
that
determination
of
the
joint
board
and
they
persisted
in
their
efforts
to
regain
the
work.
now,
i’m--
just
to
telescope
the
fact
just
a
little
bit
throughout
this
whole
period
before,
during,
and
after
the
joint
board
submission.
local
825
engaged
in
coercive
efforts,
this
is
agreed,
engaged
in
coercive
efforts
by
threats
of
work
stoppages
and
by
work
stoppages
to
compel
white
to
change
its
work
assignment.
now,
white,
of
course,
who
was
doing
the
work
in--
who
was
the
employer
who
was
doing
the
work
in
question
and
local
825,
so
long
as
it
observed
unlawful
efforts
including,
among
other
things,
section
8
(b)
4
(d),
had
a
perfect
right
to
try
to
get
this
work.
but,
the
fact
is
that
local
825
didn’t
confine
itself
to
lawful
efforts.
not
only
did
it
use
coercive
pressures
against
white,
the
employer
directly
involved,
the
primary
employer,
it
also
used
coercive
pressures
against
the
general
contractor
burns,
against
the
two
other
subcontractors
chicago
and
poirier
as
a
means
to
getting
white
to
comply
with
its
demands.
now,
burns,
chicago,
and
poirier
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
assignment
of
white’s
work.
white
was
the
only,
and
they
had
no
authority
with
respect
to
the
assignment
of
white’s
employees.
now,
on
this
state
of
the
record,
the
board
found
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
4
(d)
of
the
act
which
is
a
jurisdictional
disputes
provision,
but
the
board
further
found
that
insofar
as
the
union
exerted
coercive
pressures
on
burns,
chicago,
and
poirier
who
were
neutrals
in
this
dispute
over--
because
of
the
workers
on
dispute,
the
union
also
violated
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
of
the
act
since
an
additional
object
of
the
union’s
pressure
against
the
neutrals
was
to
cause
a
disruption
of
business
among
the
various
employers
at
the
job
site.
in
the
board’s
view,
such
an
object,
in
the
board’s
language,
although
something
less
than
a
total
cancellation
of
business
constitutes
a
“seize
doing
business”
object
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b).
now,
there’s
no
quarrel
here
about
the
jurisdictional
dispute
finding
that’s
not
in--
challenged,
but
very
much
an
issue
is
the
propriety
of
the
board’s
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
finding.
mr.
arnold
ordman
there
were--
for
one
thing,
they
asked
white,
the--
burns,
rather,
the
general
contractor,
to
sign
a
contract
which
would’ve
bund
the
general
contractor
and
his
subcontractors
to
give
this
work
to
operating
engineers.
they
told
him
that
unless
he
signed
the
contract
there
would
be
a
work
stoppage.
there
was
a
work
stoppage.
they
told
the
other
subcontractors
unless
operating
engineers
got
the
work,
there
would
be
work
stoppages,
and
there
were
work
stoppages.
and,
as
a
result
of
which,
operating
engineers
employed
by
the
other
two
subs
went
off
the
job.
these
were
the
pressures.
incidentally,
the
court
below
agrees
that
these
kind
of
pressures,
the
threats
of
work
stoppages
and
work
stoppages
fell
within
the
statutory
disagreement--
fell
within
the
statutory
definition.
that
finding
isn’t
challenged
her
by
any
party.
now,
the
court
below,
like
the
trial
examiner
in
the
board
proceeding,
gave
the
statutory
words
“to
seize
doing
business”
a
literal
reading,
in
our
view,
an
overly
literal
reading.
an
object
of
seizing
doing
business,
to
the
court
below,
meant
a
total
and
complete
cessation
of
business
and
intent
to
cause
a
disruption
or
successive
disruptions
as
here,
in
the
court’s
view,
was
not
enough.
according
to--
the
court
below
held
that
the
statutory
criterion
for
the
finding
of
a
violation,
namely
the
object
test,
was
not
met.
this
was
not,
the
court
below
thought,
the
kind
of
classical
boycott,
secondary
boycott,
which
congress
was
after.
now,
our
position
is
the
court
below
erred.
i
suppose
much
could
be
made
of
the
fact,
if
your
honors
please,
$68-million
project
was
repeatedly
interrupted
by
a
fight
as
to
who
is
to
push
a
button
on
an
electrical
welding
machine,
but
i
don’t
want
to
make
light
of
it.
this
case,
like
the
national
woodwork,
like
others
this
court
has
before
it
reflects
the
deep
and
really
the
understandable
concern
of
unions
who
are
trying
to
preserve
their
job
opportunities
and
their
job
security
in
the
face
of
automation
and
increasing
technology.
this
court
has
talked
about
it
often
and
lucidly
in
the
national
woodwork
case
among
others.
insofar
as
the
union
sought
to
preserve
its
work
opportunity
for
the
employees
it
represented
and
insofar
as
it
used
lawful
efforts,
it
was
entitled
to
protection.
our
position
here,
however,
is
that
the
union
went
beyond
lawful
grounds.
we
submit
that
even
if
the
court
below
was
right
and
that
the
only
possible
reading
of
“seize
doing
business”
is
a
total
cessation
of
business,
we
believe
the
court
erred
on
this
regard
on
the
side
of
literalism
and
we
think
a
few
basic
postulates
established
by
this
court
confirm
our
position.
now,
first,
the
basic
thrust
of
the
so-called
secondary
boycott
provision,
that’s
8
(b)
4
(b),
formally
8
(b)
4
(a),
is
that
it
is
designed
to
protect
unoffending
employers
from
involvement
pressures
in
controversies
not
their
own.
that
was
the
congressional
intent.
it’s
documented
in
the
legislative
history,
and
this
court
has
unim--
una--
uniformly
confirmed
that
in
its
own
decisions
as
far
back
as
denver
building
in
341
us
and
at
least
as
recently
as
national
woodwork
in
386
us.
no
one
in
this
case,
no
one
even
suggests
that
burns,
the
general
contractor,
and
chicago
bridge,
and
poirier
were
anything
other
than
neutrals
in
the
dispute
between
white
and
local
825.
no
one
but
white
could
assign
the
work
that
was
in
question.
white
was
the
primary
employer,
and
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
union’s
pressures
on
the
other
three
companies
was
to
involve
them
in
a
dispute
which
was
no
part
of
their--
not
their
own,
no
part
of
their
problem.
now,
the
second
proposition,
a
literal
reading
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
like
its
companion
provision
section
8
(e)
is,
in
our
view
and
we
believe
you
have
so
have,
a
literal
reading
of
those
sections
is
an
inadequate
basis
for
determining
the
statutory
reach.
it
would
be
an
imposition
on
your
time,
if
your
honors
please,
and
my
time
is
also
limited,
to
labor
the
point
that
the
statutory
provisions
in
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
and
section
8
(e)
were
the
product
of
congressional
conflict
and
congressional
compromise,
and
that
this
conflict
and
compromise
are
reflected
in
statutory
language
which,
in
fact
to
understate
the
matter,
is
somewhat
lacking
in
precision.
i
think
it
was
this
lack
of
language
precision
which
prompted,
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan
to
make
the
comment
in
national
woodwork
which
was
a
split
opinion
and,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
commented
that
both
sides
of
today’s
division
in
the
court
agreed
that,
in
pursuing
the
search
for
the
true
intent
of
congress,
we
should
not
stop
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
must
look
beneath
its
surface
to
the
legislative
history.
we
submit
the
court
below
rested
on
the
naked
language
of
the
statute
and
failed
to
carry
out
the
mandate.
now,
third,
a
proscribed
object
such
as
the
statute
says
that
one
of
them
is
seize
doing
business,
need
not
be
the
only
or
even
the
predominant
object
to
bring
conduct
within
the
ban
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b).
the
court
below
made
much
of
the
fact
that,
after
all,
the
real
goal
of
the
union
here
in
all
its
activities
against
all
the
employers
was
not
to
bring
about
a
permanent
cessation
of
business.
what
they
wanted
was
the
work
that
white
wasn’t
giving
to
them,
and
that
the
real
object,
the
real
goal
was
to
get
the
neutrals,
the
secondaries
to
pressure
the
primary
into
hiring
operating
engineers.
that
was
the
burden
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
and
we
concede
it.
the
board
so
found,
and
the
finding
was
the
crux
of
a
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
holding,
but
denver
building
again
was
the
first
of
a
long
line
of
cases
establishing
that
it
is
efficient,
as
the
board
here
found,
if
a
cessation
of
business
was
an
additional
object,
an
object
of
the
union’s
conduct.
and
this
court,
again,
pointed
out
in
these
two
cases
that
come
to
mind
immediately,
that
congress
deliberately
substituted
the
words
“an
object,”
for
the
original
bill
which
was
condemned
when
you
did--
when
you
exerted
coercive
pressures
for
a
purpose.
they
thought
that
was
too
limited
and
substituted
the
words
“an
object”
and,
plainly,
an
“object
of
the
union’s
conduct”
here
was
to
bring
out
about
the
kind
of
disruptions
of
business,
the
kind
of
work
stoppages,
such
work
stoppages
as
would
be
appropriate
or
necessary
to
achieve
its
goal
either
of
obtaining
that
work
from
white
or
conceivably
from
a
more
compliant
subcontractor.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
i
believe
because
the
board
has
worked
in
this
area.
frankly,
if
it
has
expertise,
it
has
expertise
in
the
secondary
boycott
area.
as
this
court
is
aware,
we’ve
been
before
this
court
any
number
of
times
in
this
area
and
i
think
the
board’s
expertise
is
entitled
to
consider
this.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
i
believe
it
is
a
pure
question
of
law
and
i
don’t--
and,
of
course,
the
board’s
position--
the
board’s
view
of
this
does
not
overbear
what
the
court
can
say
and,
of
course,
the
board
must
defer
to
the
court
on
the
question
of
law
but,
our
submission
is,
i
probably
meant
to
say
that
the
board’s
view
of
the
statute,
plus
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
is
entitled
to
consideration
not
controlling
exactly,
but
certainly
entitled
to
consideration.
mr.
arnold
ordman
8
(b)
4
(b)?
mr.
arnold
ordman
and
on
the--
mr.
arnold
ordman
on
the
1959,
yes.
mr.
arnold
ordman
both.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
but
national
woodwork
was
decided
after.
mr.
arnold
ordman
and,
jacksonville
terminal
which
is
also
based
here
was
decided
after,
and--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
the
same
general
content.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
i
think
they
do.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
the
decision
would
be
the
same.
congress
did
state
that
it
was
making
an
effort
in
1959
to--
mr.
arnold
ordman
to
blue
poles.
on
the
other
hand,
at
the
same
time,
it
interpolated
that
proviso
which
indicated
it
wanted
to
protect
primary--
that
it
wanted
to
protect
primary
picketing
but,
i
believe,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
both,
under
both
versions
in
1947
or--
mr.
arnold
ordman
has
no
real
significance
here.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
it
just
solidifies
that
it
does
contain
the
primary
proviso
protecting
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
that
was
an
interpretation
which
the
act
had
been
given
before
that
proviso
was
had.
mr.
arnold
ordman
of
course,
the
pure
question
of
law--
mr.
arnold
ordman
no.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the--
no,
we
do
not.
the
pure
question
of
law,
i
submit,
is
the
only--
is
the
pivotal
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
“to
seize
doing
business”
must
be
read
as
a
naked
statutory
language
of
whether
we
must
look
back
to
this
legislative
history
to
determine
the
real
meaning
of
that
language.
this
is
the
place,
i
think,
where
the
board
and
the
courts
are
real--
the
board
and
the
court
below
really
divide.
the
court
looked
at
the
that
language,
as
the
statute
wrote
it,
to
seize
doing
business,
i
might
almost
suggest
in
a
dictionary
sense
rather
than
looking
forward
and
looking
back
at
the
legislative
history
to
see
what
congress
was
really
after.
of
course,
once
you
decide
the
test
then,
of
course,
the
facts--
you
then
must
appraise
the
facts
to
see
whether
it
meets
that
test
or
the
meaning
that
that
language
meant
to
which
we
must--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct,
and
that’s
why
i
say
it’s
not
a
question
of
act--
of
the
actual
occurrences.
there’s
no
dispute
between
the
court
and
the
board
as
to
what
actually
happened.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
that
is
the
point--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
that
is
the
point
i
wish
to
make.
first,
i
think
a
broad
reading
certainly
does
pre--
i
think
we
prevail
even
on
a
narrow
meaning,
and
i’d
like
to
touch
on
that
quickly.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no.
the
court
below
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
union
didn’t
admit,
they
didn’t
say
it
wanted
a
total
cessation
of
business.
i
might
make
reference
to
a
footnote
in
the
board
decision
that
in
the--
to
the
board
decision.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
it’s
undisputed
here,
the
union
came
to
white--
to
burns,
the
general
contractor
who
had
no
employees.
he
had
asked
him
to
sign
a
contract
which
would
not
only
bind
him
to
give
this
kind
of
work
to--
electrical
welding
machine
work
to
operating
engineers,
it
would
also
bind
his
subcontractors.
now,
the
union
asked
the
general
contractor
to
sign
that
contract
and
said
“if
you
don’t,
you’ll
have
a
work
stoppage,”
and
there
was.
now,
if
the
general
contractor
had
signed
that
work
stop--
that
agreement,
white
either
would
have--
the
subcontractor,
either
would
have
to
comply
and
achieve
the
union’s
purpose
or,
under
his
contract
obligation,
the
general
contractor
would
have
to
say
“get
off
the
project.”
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
that
sense
alone,
moreover,
we
suggest
that--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board
took
a--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board
took
a
broader
view,
but
it
cites
this
fact,
and
it
did
decide
this
case
on
the
facts
and
this
very
submission
of
the
contract,
and
the
contract
is
noted
in
footnote
6
of
the
board--
in
footnote
of
the
board
decision.
i
think
you’ll
find
it
on
page
6of
the
appendix.
page
6
of
the
appendix,
footnote
5,
the
contracts
of
white
and
burns
provided
for
respondent’s
members
to
perform
the
disputed
work
and
said
they
couldn’t
subcontract
any
work
covered
by
the
agreement
unless
the
subcontractor
agreed
in
writing
to
perform
all
the
work.
besides
that,
we
submit
that
the
fact
is
that
the
union
did
bring
about
two
successive
work
stoppages
against
the
neutrals
which,
in
it
of
themselves,
can
be
read
as
cessations
of
business.
the
fact
is
that
the
union
sought
here
to
impose
a
wholly
new
working
arrangement.
in
other
words,
it
says
seize
doing
business
with
white,
the
subcontractor,
if
he’s
going
to
do
business
assigning
work
to
whom
he
pleases.
you
can
only
work
with
him
under
a
new
method
which
we
prescribe,
namely
that
you
hire
operating
engineers
to
do
this
work.
and,
incidentally,
the
suggestion
is
that
the
board
didn’t
spell
this
out
either
because
the
board
talked
only
about
something
less
than
a
total
cancellation
of
business
is
seize
doing
business.
we
believe
that
is
right,
but
the
board,
on
these
other
theories
and
i
believe
the
amicus
brief
of
the
afl-cio
didn’t
spell
out
its
rationale.
the
board
cited
the
local
3ivw
case
in
its
decision
in
support
of
its
present
holding,
in
which
precisely
this
rationale
is
spelled
out,
and
i
don’t
reach
in
re
as
requiring
the
board
having
cited
a
case
which
makes
such
a
holding
to
repeat
the
rationale
of
that
case.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
quick
caveat.
i
think
it’s
important.
preliminarily,
one,
the
court
below
was
concerned
about
the
classical
secondary
boycott.
i
really
submit
that
this
type
of
boycott
we
find
in
this
case,
the
ultimate
objection
of
the
union
and
there
were
a
lot
of
objectives
to
get
more
members,
that
the
type
of
boycott
we’ve
got
in
this
case,
which
is
typical
of
the
many
case
we
have
which
arise
in
the
construction
industry,
might
more
nearly
be
described
as
a
classical
boycott
as
the
one
the
court
below
described.
now,
one
very
important
caveat,
we
are
confining
this
analysis
to
situations,
whereas
in
the
instant
case,
the
thrust
of
the
union’s
conduct
is
directed
at
secondary
neutral
employers.
we
recognize
that
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing
which
are
protected
have
secondary
impacts,
and
this
court
has
noted
that
again
in
international
rice
milling
and
in
the
national
woodwork
case.
and,
primary
strikes
are
protected
under
the
statutory
scheme,
notwithstanding,
that
they
necessarily
even
have
intended
secondary
impacts.
we
recognize
also,
as
a
responded
union
urges
and
the
afl-cio
urges,
as
amicus,
argues,
we
recognize
that
congress
created
no
sweeping
prohibition
even
of
secondary
conduct.
we
don’t
want
to
clinch
on
these
limitations.
we
limit
ourselves
to
the
case
where
the
impact
is
purely
and
expressly
on
secondary
employers.
thank
you.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
there
was
a
contract
bargaining
dispute,
mr.
justice
harlan.
these
people,
both
burns
and
white,
were
part
of
a
multi-employer
contractual
arrangement.
during
this
period,
there
was
a
fight
they
had
gotten
out
of
it.
subsequently,
the
multi-employer
arrangement
was
found
valid
by
the
board
and
all
these
parties
now
are
governed
by
a
collective
bargaining
contract
which
disposes
of
this
kind
of
dispute.
there
was
a
temporary
hiatus
in
the
bargaining
relationship
between
the
subcontractor
and
the
union.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
gather
this
project,
this
building,
is
completed.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
gather
the
project
is
completed.
these
incidents
took
place
back
in
1965.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
your
honor,
the
question
still
remains
as
to
what
is
cessation
of
business
and
the
object
test.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
mr.
chief
justice,
just
one
observation.
i
think
mr.
gold
has
conceded
the
fact
that
the
cessation
of
business
can
be
something
less
than
total
and
complete.
i
merely
to--
wish
to
observe
that
his
definition
of
this
question
of
something
being
economically
disadvantageous
to
the
neutral
is
something
new
that
our
courts
have
not
adopted,
and
i
would
submit
that
there
were
many
subcontractors.
they
came
on
this
site
under
burns
&
roe,
subsequent
to
these
three
and
the
economic
disadvantageous
definition,
which
has
never
been
adopted,
no
legislative
history
to
support,
ignores:
one,
they
were
economically
damaged
by
having
their
jobs
stopped.
these
men
have
superintendents.
they
have
equipment.
they
have
running
expenses.
they
were
economically
damaged,
irrespective
of
what
would
happen
with
the
welding
machine.
moreover,
the
joint
board
procedure
and
the
appendix
indicates
clearly
that
under
the
engineer’s
contract,
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
324,
says
that
with
regard
to
that
joint
board
procedure
which
bound
all
of
these
employers,
that
the
last
known
job
decision
must
be
followed
by
each
of
them.
consequently,
if
the
engineers
had
won
this
particular
type
of
dispute,
that
would
have
been
a
condition
that
would
have
to
have
been
accepted
by
burns
and
any
of
his
sub
and,
consequently,
it
would’ve
been
economically
disadvantageous.
mr.
arnold
ordman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
consolidated
here
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
broad
terms,
the
questions
presented
in
both
these
cases
is
whether
the
union,
local
825,
of
the
operating
engineers
violated
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
so-called
secondary
boycott
provision
by
exerting
coercive
pressures
upon
neutral
employers
in
support
of
its
dispute
with
the
primary
employer,
the
white
construction
company.
now,
that
question
can
be
further
refined.
all
parties
and
the
board
and
the
court
below
are
in
agreement
here
that
the
union
did
exert
coercive
pressures
as
defined
by
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
upon
neutral
employers.
now,
that
statutory
section
further
requires,
for
purposes
relevant
here,
that
such
coercive
conduct
have,
as
an
object,
forcing
or
requiring
an
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
now,
this
is
the
pivotal
issue
in
the
case.
the
board
found
that
the
union’s
coercive
conduct
had
cessation
of
business
as
it
read
the
statute,
in
the
statutory
sense,
as
an
object
of
its
conduct
and
the
board,
therefore,
found
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b).
the
court
below
disagreed.
unlike
the
board
and
unlike
other
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
this
issue,
the
court
below
reads
the
language
in
the
statute
quite
literally.
on
the
basis
of
that
literal
reading,
the
court
below
held
that
the
proof
was
insufficient
to
prove
that
the
union
had
an
object
to--
had
a
“seize
doing
business”
object
because
the
union
did
not,
as
the
court
saw
the
case,
ask
for
a
total
cessation
of
business.
now,
the
underlying
facts
on
at
issue,
the
instant
labor
dispute
arose
at
a
construction
site
in
oyster
creek,
new
jersey
where
a
burns
&
roe,
inc.,
a
general
contractor,
was
building
a
$68-billion
nuclear
power
plant
for
the
jersey
central
power
and
light
company.
burns
&
roe,
the
general
contractor
in
charge
of
this
project,
had
no
employees
of
its
own.
it
delegated
all
the--
no
construction
workers.
it
delegated
all
the
construction
work
to
three
subcontractors,
the
white
construction
company,
the
chicago
bridge,
and--
iron
company,
and
the
poirier
&
mclane
corporation.
now,
all
these
three
subcontractors
had,
among
their
employees,
members
of
the
local
825
operating
engineers
union.
local
825
had
contracts
with
two
of
the
subcontractors,
chicago
bridge
and
poirier.
it
had
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
either
burns,
the
general
contractor,
or
with
the
white
construction
company.
now,
white’s
job,
one
of
the
three
subcontractors,
its
job
under
its
subcontractor
was
to
build
this
nuclear
power
plant,
to
create
the
reactor
building
for
the
nuclear
power
plant,
and
white’s
equipment
included,
among
other
things,
a
piece
of
equipment
known
as
an
electrical
welding
machine.
and,
as
soon
as
white
got
the
subcontract,
he
assigned
the
operation
of
this
electrical
welding
machine,
including--
starting
on
stopping
the
machine
to
employees
of
his
who
were
members
of
the
iron
workers
union
and
local
825,
the
operating
engineers
union,
who
wanted
that
work
and
urged
upon
white
that
employees
of
white
who
were
members
of
local
825
of
operating
engineers
be
given
the
job
of
pushing
the
buttons
which
started
and
stopped
the
welding
machine.
now,
local
825,
as
i
pointed
out,
didn’t
have
contracts
with
white,
this
subcontractor,
or
with
the
general
contractor
but,
in
support
of
its
demand,
they
presented
profit
agreements
to
white
and
to
burns.
as--
in
effect,
those
agreements
would
commit
white,
the
subcontractor,
and
the
general
contractor
to
give
all
power
equipment
including
specifically
welding
machines
and
give
that
jurisdiction
to
the
operating
engineers.
now,
these
agreements
would
not
only
have
bound
the
signatory,
white,
who
was
doing
that
work,
it
also
bound
subcontractors
of
the
signatory
so
that
burns
&
roe,
the
general
contractor,
would
have
been
bound
to
apply
that
subcontract
to
white
who
was
a
subcontractor.
now,
neither
white
nor
burns
agreed
to
sign
or
yielded
to
this
pressure
to
sign
the
agreements.
now,
while
this
dispute
was
going
on,
since
all
the
parties
involved
had
agreed
that
disputes
of
this
kind,
really
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
should
be
submitted
to
the
national
joint
board
for
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes.
the
dispute
was
submitted
around
october
6th
and,
within
a
couple
of
weeks,
the
national
joint
board
for
the
settlement
of--
i
think
it
used
to
be
called
the
dunlop
board,
settled
this
dispute
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
iron
workers
to
whom
white
had
given
the
work.
but,
the
operating
engineers
weren’t
satisfied.
they
didn’t
submit.
they
refused
to
comply
with
that
submission,
with
that
determination
of
the
joint
board
and
they
persisted
in
their
efforts
to
regain
the
work.
now,
i’m--
just
to
telescope
the
fact
just
a
little
bit
throughout
this
whole
period
before,
during,
and
after
the
joint
board
submission.
local
825
engaged
in
coercive
efforts,
this
is
agreed,
engaged
in
coercive
efforts
by
threats
of
work
stoppages
and
by
work
stoppages
to
compel
white
to
change
its
work
assignment.
now,
white,
of
course,
who
was
doing
the
work
in--
who
was
the
employer
who
was
doing
the
work
in
question
and
local
825,
so
long
as
it
observed
unlawful
efforts
including,
among
other
things,
section
8
(b)
4
(d),
had
a
perfect
right
to
try
to
get
this
work.
but,
the
fact
is
that
local
825
didn’t
confine
itself
to
lawful
efforts.
not
only
did
it
use
coercive
pressures
against
white,
the
employer
directly
involved,
the
primary
employer,
it
also
used
coercive
pressures
against
the
general
contractor
burns,
against
the
two
other
subcontractors
chicago
and
poirier
as
a
means
to
getting
white
to
comply
with
its
demands.
now,
burns,
chicago,
and
poirier
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
assignment
of
white’s
work.
white
was
the
only,
and
they
had
no
authority
with
respect
to
the
assignment
of
white’s
employees.
now,
on
this
state
of
the
record,
the
board
found
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
4
(d)
of
the
act
which
is
a
jurisdictional
disputes
provision,
but
the
board
further
found
that
insofar
as
the
union
exerted
coercive
pressures
on
burns,
chicago,
and
poirier
who
were
neutrals
in
this
dispute
over--
because
of
the
workers
on
dispute,
the
union
also
violated
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
of
the
act
since
an
additional
object
of
the
union’s
pressure
against
the
neutrals
was
to
cause
a
disruption
of
business
among
the
various
employers
at
the
job
site.
in
the
board’s
view,
such
an
object,
in
the
board’s
language,
although
something
less
than
a
total
cancellation
of
business
constitutes
a
“seize
doing
business”
object
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b).
now,
there’s
no
quarrel
here
about
the
jurisdictional
dispute
finding
that’s
not
in--
challenged,
but
very
much
an
issue
is
the
propriety
of
the
board’s
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
finding.
mr.
arnold
ordman
there
were--
for
one
thing,
they
asked
white,
the--
burns,
rather,
the
general
contractor,
to
sign
a
contract
which
would’ve
bund
the
general
contractor
and
his
subcontractors
to
give
this
work
to
operating
engineers.
they
told
him
that
unless
he
signed
the
contract
there
would
be
a
work
stoppage.
there
was
a
work
stoppage.
they
told
the
other
subcontractors
unless
operating
engineers
got
the
work,
there
would
be
work
stoppages,
and
there
were
work
stoppages.
and,
as
a
result
of
which,
operating
engineers
employed
by
the
other
two
subs
went
off
the
job.
these
were
the
pressures.
incidentally,
the
court
below
agrees
that
these
kind
of
pressures,
the
threats
of
work
stoppages
and
work
stoppages
fell
within
the
statutory
disagreement--
fell
within
the
statutory
definition.
that
finding
isn’t
challenged
her
by
any
party.
now,
the
court
below,
like
the
trial
examiner
in
the
board
proceeding,
gave
the
statutory
words
“to
seize
doing
business”
a
literal
reading,
in
our
view,
an
overly
literal
reading.
an
object
of
seizing
doing
business,
to
the
court
below,
meant
a
total
and
complete
cessation
of
business
and
intent
to
cause
a
disruption
or
successive
disruptions
as
here,
in
the
court’s
view,
was
not
enough.
according
to--
the
court
below
held
that
the
statutory
criterion
for
the
finding
of
a
violation,
namely
the
object
test,
was
not
met.
this
was
not,
the
court
below
thought,
the
kind
of
classical
boycott,
secondary
boycott,
which
congress
was
after.
now,
our
position
is
the
court
below
erred.
i
suppose
much
could
be
made
of
the
fact,
if
your
honors
please,
$68-million
project
was
repeatedly
interrupted
by
a
fight
as
to
who
is
to
push
a
button
on
an
electrical
welding
machine,
but
i
don’t
want
to
make
light
of
it.
this
case,
like
the
national
woodwork,
like
others
this
court
has
before
it
reflects
the
deep
and
really
the
understandable
concern
of
unions
who
are
trying
to
preserve
their
job
opportunities
and
their
job
security
in
the
face
of
automation
and
increasing
technology.
this
court
has
talked
about
it
often
and
lucidly
in
the
national
woodwork
case
among
others.
insofar
as
the
union
sought
to
preserve
its
work
opportunity
for
the
employees
it
represented
and
insofar
as
it
used
lawful
efforts,
it
was
entitled
to
protection.
our
position
here,
however,
is
that
the
union
went
beyond
lawful
grounds.
we
submit
that
even
if
the
court
below
was
right
and
that
the
only
possible
reading
of
“seize
doing
business”
is
a
total
cessation
of
business,
we
believe
the
court
erred
on
this
regard
on
the
side
of
literalism
and
we
think
a
few
basic
postulates
established
by
this
court
confirm
our
position.
now,
first,
the
basic
thrust
of
the
so-called
secondary
boycott
provision,
that’s
8
(b)
4
(b),
formally
8
(b)
4
(a),
is
that
it
is
designed
to
protect
unoffending
employers
from
involvement
pressures
in
controversies
not
their
own.
that
was
the
congressional
intent.
it’s
documented
in
the
legislative
history,
and
this
court
has
unim--
una--
uniformly
confirmed
that
in
its
own
decisions
as
far
back
as
denver
building
in
341
us
and
at
least
as
recently
as
national
woodwork
in
386
us.
no
one
in
this
case,
no
one
even
suggests
that
burns,
the
general
contractor,
and
chicago
bridge,
and
poirier
were
anything
other
than
neutrals
in
the
dispute
between
white
and
local
825.
no
one
but
white
could
assign
the
work
that
was
in
question.
white
was
the
primary
employer,
and
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
union’s
pressures
on
the
other
three
companies
was
to
involve
them
in
a
dispute
which
was
no
part
of
their--
not
their
own,
no
part
of
their
problem.
now,
the
second
proposition,
a
literal
reading
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
like
its
companion
provision
section
8
(e)
is,
in
our
view
and
we
believe
you
have
so
have,
a
literal
reading
of
those
sections
is
an
inadequate
basis
for
determining
the
statutory
reach.
it
would
be
an
imposition
on
your
time,
if
your
honors
please,
and
my
time
is
also
limited,
to
labor
the
point
that
the
statutory
provisions
in
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
and
section
8
(e)
were
the
product
of
congressional
conflict
and
congressional
compromise,
and
that
this
conflict
and
compromise
are
reflected
in
statutory
language
which,
in
fact
to
understate
the
matter,
is
somewhat
lacking
in
precision.
i
think
it
was
this
lack
of
language
precision
which
prompted,
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan
to
make
the
comment
in
national
woodwork
which
was
a
split
opinion
and,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
commented
that
both
sides
of
today’s
division
in
the
court
agreed
that,
in
pursuing
the
search
for
the
true
intent
of
congress,
we
should
not
stop
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
must
look
beneath
its
surface
to
the
legislative
history.
we
submit
the
court
below
rested
on
the
naked
language
of
the
statute
and
failed
to
carry
out
the
mandate.
now,
third,
a
proscribed
object
such
as
the
statute
says
that
one
of
them
is
seize
doing
business,
need
not
be
the
only
or
even
the
predominant
object
to
bring
conduct
within
the
ban
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b).
the
court
below
made
much
of
the
fact
that,
after
all,
the
real
goal
of
the
union
here
in
all
its
activities
against
all
the
employers
was
not
to
bring
about
a
permanent
cessation
of
business.
what
they
wanted
was
the
work
that
white
wasn’t
giving
to
them,
and
that
the
real
object,
the
real
goal
was
to
get
the
neutrals,
the
secondaries
to
pressure
the
primary
into
hiring
operating
engineers.
that
was
the
burden
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
and
we
concede
it.
the
board
so
found,
and
the
finding
was
the
crux
of
a
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
holding,
but
denver
building
again
was
the
first
of
a
long
line
of
cases
establishing
that
it
is
efficient,
as
the
board
here
found,
if
a
cessation
of
business
was
an
additional
object,
an
object
of
the
union’s
conduct.
and
this
court,
again,
pointed
out
in
these
two
cases
that
come
to
mind
immediately,
that
congress
deliberately
substituted
the
words
“an
object,”
for
the
original
bill
which
was
condemned
when
you
did--
when
you
exerted
coercive
pressures
for
a
purpose.
they
thought
that
was
too
limited
and
substituted
the
words
“an
object”
and,
plainly,
an
“object
of
the
union’s
conduct”
here
was
to
bring
out
about
the
kind
of
disruptions
of
business,
the
kind
of
work
stoppages,
such
work
stoppages
as
would
be
appropriate
or
necessary
to
achieve
its
goal
either
of
obtaining
that
work
from
white
or
conceivably
from
a
more
compliant
subcontractor.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
i
believe
because
the
board
has
worked
in
this
area.
frankly,
if
it
has
expertise,
it
has
expertise
in
the
secondary
boycott
area.
as
this
court
is
aware,
we’ve
been
before
this
court
any
number
of
times
in
this
area
and
i
think
the
board’s
expertise
is
entitled
to
consider
this.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
i
believe
it
is
a
pure
question
of
law
and
i
don’t--
and,
of
course,
the
board’s
position--
the
board’s
view
of
this
does
not
overbear
what
the
court
can
say
and,
of
course,
the
board
must
defer
to
the
court
on
the
question
of
law
but,
our
submission
is,
i
probably
meant
to
say
that
the
board’s
view
of
the
statute,
plus
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
is
entitled
to
consideration
not
controlling
exactly,
but
certainly
entitled
to
consideration.
mr.
arnold
ordman
8
(b)
4
(b)?
mr.
arnold
ordman
and
on
the--
mr.
arnold
ordman
on
the
1959,
yes.
mr.
arnold
ordman
both.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
but
national
woodwork
was
decided
after.
mr.
arnold
ordman
and,
jacksonville
terminal
which
is
also
based
here
was
decided
after,
and--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
the
same
general
content.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
i
think
they
do.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
the
decision
would
be
the
same.
congress
did
state
that
it
was
making
an
effort
in
1959
to--
mr.
arnold
ordman
to
blue
poles.
on
the
other
hand,
at
the
same
time,
it
interpolated
that
proviso
which
indicated
it
wanted
to
protect
primary--
that
it
wanted
to
protect
primary
picketing
but,
i
believe,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
both,
under
both
versions
in
1947
or--
mr.
arnold
ordman
has
no
real
significance
here.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
it
just
solidifies
that
it
does
contain
the
primary
proviso
protecting
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
that
was
an
interpretation
which
the
act
had
been
given
before
that
proviso
was
had.
mr.
arnold
ordman
of
course,
the
pure
question
of
law--
mr.
arnold
ordman
no.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the--
no,
we
do
not.
the
pure
question
of
law,
i
submit,
is
the
only--
is
the
pivotal
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
“to
seize
doing
business”
must
be
read
as
a
naked
statutory
language
of
whether
we
must
look
back
to
this
legislative
history
to
determine
the
real
meaning
of
that
language.
this
is
the
place,
i
think,
where
the
board
and
the
courts
are
real--
the
board
and
the
court
below
really
divide.
the
court
looked
at
the
that
language,
as
the
statute
wrote
it,
to
seize
doing
business,
i
might
almost
suggest
in
a
dictionary
sense
rather
than
looking
forward
and
looking
back
at
the
legislative
history
to
see
what
congress
was
really
after.
of
course,
once
you
decide
the
test
then,
of
course,
the
facts--
you
then
must
appraise
the
facts
to
see
whether
it
meets
that
test
or
the
meaning
that
that
language
meant
to
which
we
must--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct,
and
that’s
why
i
say
it’s
not
a
question
of
act--
of
the
actual
occurrences.
there’s
no
dispute
between
the
court
and
the
board
as
to
what
actually
happened.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
that
is
the
point--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
that
is
the
point
i
wish
to
make.
first,
i
think
a
broad
reading
certainly
does
pre--
i
think
we
prevail
even
on
a
narrow
meaning,
and
i’d
like
to
touch
on
that
quickly.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no.
the
court
below
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
union
didn’t
admit,
they
didn’t
say
it
wanted
a
total
cessation
of
business.
i
might
make
reference
to
a
footnote
in
the
board
decision
that
in
the--
to
the
board
decision.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
it’s
undisputed
here,
the
union
came
to
white--
to
burns,
the
general
contractor
who
had
no
employees.
he
had
asked
him
to
sign
a
contract
which
would
not
only
bind
him
to
give
this
kind
of
work
to--
electrical
welding
machine
work
to
operating
engineers,
it
would
also
bind
his
subcontractors.
now,
the
union
asked
the
general
contractor
to
sign
that
contract
and
said
“if
you
don’t,
you’ll
have
a
work
stoppage,”
and
there
was.
now,
if
the
general
contractor
had
signed
that
work
stop--
that
agreement,
white
either
would
have--
the
subcontractor,
either
would
have
to
comply
and
achieve
the
union’s
purpose
or,
under
his
contract
obligation,
the
general
contractor
would
have
to
say
“get
off
the
project.”
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
that
sense
alone,
moreover,
we
suggest
that--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board
took
a--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board
took
a
broader
view,
but
it
cites
this
fact,
and
it
did
decide
this
case
on
the
facts
and
this
very
submission
of
the
contract,
and
the
contract
is
noted
in
footnote
6
of
the
board--
in
footnote
of
the
board
decision.
i
think
you’ll
find
it
on
page
6of
the
appendix.
page
6
of
the
appendix,
footnote
5,
the
contracts
of
white
and
burns
provided
for
respondent’s
members
to
perform
the
disputed
work
and
said
they
couldn’t
subcontract
any
work
covered
by
the
agreement
unless
the
subcontractor
agreed
in
writing
to
perform
all
the
work.
besides
that,
we
submit
that
the
fact
is
that
the
union
did
bring
about
two
successive
work
stoppages
against
the
neutrals
which,
in
it
of
themselves,
can
be
read
as
cessations
of
business.
the
fact
is
that
the
union
sought
here
to
impose
a
wholly
new
working
arrangement.
in
other
words,
it
says
seize
doing
business
with
white,
the
subcontractor,
if
he’s
going
to
do
business
assigning
work
to
whom
he
pleases.
you
can
only
work
with
him
under
a
new
method
which
we
prescribe,
namely
that
you
hire
operating
engineers
to
do
this
work.
and,
incidentally,
the
suggestion
is
that
the
board
didn’t
spell
this
out
either
because
the
board
talked
only
about
something
less
than
a
total
cancellation
of
business
is
seize
doing
business.
we
believe
that
is
right,
but
the
board,
on
these
other
theories
and
i
believe
the
amicus
brief
of
the
afl-cio
didn’t
spell
out
its
rationale.
the
board
cited
the
local
3ivw
case
in
its
decision
in
support
of
its
present
holding,
in
which
precisely
this
rationale
is
spelled
out,
and
i
don’t
reach
in
re
as
requiring
the
board
having
cited
a
case
which
makes
such
a
holding
to
repeat
the
rationale
of
that
case.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
quick
caveat.
i
think
it’s
important.
preliminarily,
one,
the
court
below
was
concerned
about
the
classical
secondary
boycott.
i
really
submit
that
this
type
of
boycott
we
find
in
this
case,
the
ultimate
objection
of
the
union
and
there
were
a
lot
of
objectives
to
get
more
members,
that
the
type
of
boycott
we’ve
got
in
this
case,
which
is
typical
of
the
many
case
we
have
which
arise
in
the
construction
industry,
might
more
nearly
be
described
as
a
classical
boycott
as
the
one
the
court
below
described.
now,
one
very
important
caveat,
we
are
confining
this
analysis
to
situations,
whereas
in
the
instant
case,
the
thrust
of
the
union’s
conduct
is
directed
at
secondary
neutral
employers.
we
recognize
that
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing
which
are
protected
have
secondary
impacts,
and
this
court
has
noted
that
again
in
international
rice
milling
and
in
the
national
woodwork
case.
and,
primary
strikes
are
protected
under
the
statutory
scheme,
notwithstanding,
that
they
necessarily
even
have
intended
secondary
impacts.
we
recognize
also,
as
a
responded
union
urges
and
the
afl-cio
urges,
as
amicus,
argues,
we
recognize
that
congress
created
no
sweeping
prohibition
even
of
secondary
conduct.
we
don’t
want
to
clinch
on
these
limitations.
we
limit
ourselves
to
the
case
where
the
impact
is
purely
and
expressly
on
secondary
employers.
thank
you.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
there
was
a
contract
bargaining
dispute,
mr.
justice
harlan.
these
people,
both
burns
and
white,
were
part
of
a
multi-employer
contractual
arrangement.
during
this
period,
there
was
a
fight
they
had
gotten
out
of
it.
subsequently,
the
multi-employer
arrangement
was
found
valid
by
the
board
and
all
these
parties
now
are
governed
by
a
collective
bargaining
contract
which
disposes
of
this
kind
of
dispute.
there
was
a
temporary
hiatus
in
the
bargaining
relationship
between
the
subcontractor
and
the
union.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
gather
this
project,
this
building,
is
completed.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
gather
the
project
is
completed.
these
incidents
took
place
back
in
1965.
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
your
honor,
the
question
still
remains
as
to
what
is
cessation
of
business
and
the
object
test.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
mr.
chief
justice,
just
one
observation.
i
think
mr.
gold
has
conceded
the
fact
that
the
cessation
of
business
can
be
something
less
than
total
and
complete.
i
merely
to--
wish
to
observe
that
his
definition
of
this
question
of
something
being
economically
disadvantageous
to
the
neutral
is
something
new
that
our
courts
have
not
adopted,
and
i
would
submit
that
there
were
many
subcontractors.
they
came
on
this
site
under
burns
&
roe,
subsequent
to
these
three
and
the
economic
disadvantageous
definition,
which
has
never
been
adopted,
no
legislative
history
to
support,
ignores:
one,
they
were
economically
damaged
by
having
their
jobs
stopped.
these
men
have
superintendents.
they
have
equipment.
they
have
running
expenses.
they
were
economically
damaged,
irrespective
of
what
would
happen
with
the
welding
machine.
moreover,
the
joint
board
procedure
and
the
appendix
indicates
clearly
that
under
the
engineer’s
contract,
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
324,
says
that
with
regard
to
that
joint
board
procedure
which
bound
all
of
these
employers,
that
the
last
known
job
decision
must
be
followed
by
each
of
them.
consequently,
if
the
engineers
had
won
this
particular
type
of
dispute,
that
would
have
been
a
condition
that
would
have
to
have
been
accepted
by
burns
and
any
of
his
sub
and,
consequently,
it
would’ve
been
economically
disadvantageous.
