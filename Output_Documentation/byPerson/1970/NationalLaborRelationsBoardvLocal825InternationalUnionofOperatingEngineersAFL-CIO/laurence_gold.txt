mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
best
if
i
started
by
attempting
to
distinguish
between
what
we
regard
as
two
very
separate
issues
in
the
law
of
secondary
boycotts.
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
which
have
come
before
this
court
involved
situations
involving
the
primary-secondary
dichotomy,
whether
activity
is
primary
and,
therefore,
outside
the
sweep
of
section
8
(b)
4
because
of
the
explicit
proviso
in
the
1959
legislation
and
because
of
the
manifest
intent
of
congress,
as
this
court
recognized
prior
to
1959.
it
was
our
understanding
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
that
that
facet
of
the
overall
problem
relating
to
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
was
not
in
this
case.
the
decision
below
concentrates
on
quite
a
different
problem
but,
as
mr.
aronson
points
out,
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
in
carrier
and
general
electric
which
indicate
that
there’s
a
test
of
relatedness
of
work
and
there
are
no
findings
by
the
board
on
that
issue.
the
board
simply
states
and
assumes
that
all
the
employers
other
than
white
were
neutral,
and--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
this,
as
i
say
from
our
reading
of
the
decisions--
mr.
laurence
gold
by
the
trial
examiner
of
the
board
and
the
court
below
was
that
this
issue,
as
to
primary-secondary,
was
not
in
this
case,
and
we
briefed
the
case
accordingly.
i
just
note
that,
in
light
of
carrier
and
general
electric,
if
there
are
no
findings
about
relatedness
of
work
here
and
it
might
be
that
the
board’s
findings
are
defective
in
that
regard
in
addition
to
the
regard
which
i’d
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
now.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
that,
i
think
that
is
clearly
correct
and
i
think,
in
addition,
the
question
is
what
is--
narrowing
down
to
the
point
you
raised
in
putting
aside
the
primary-secondary
aspects,
the
question
is,
from
all
the
evidence,
can
the
board
rationally
infer
that
there
was
an
object
cessate--
seized
doing
business
object
or--
mr.
laurence
gold
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
well,
our
view
is--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
well,
i
feel
that
talking
in
terms
of
cessation
of
business
alone
isn’t
sufficient.
through
the
years,
we
have
fought
for
the
proposition
that
literalism
is
not
the
key
to
this
statute,
and
we
afford
for
it
because
we
think
that
that
is
the
correct
view
in
light
of
the
way
the
statute
was
written
and
in
light
of
the
legislative
history,
and
we’re
not
going
to
abandon
that
position
for
any
short-term
advantage
in
this
case.
however,
we
do
believe
that
the
board
has
to
make
a
finding
as
to
the
union’s
object.
it
has
to
find
that
there
was
an
illegal
means
and
an
illegal
object.
and,
in
finding
the
illegal
object,
it
has
to
look--
it
has
to
determine
what
the
policy
embodied
in
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
is,
and
whether
the
union
is
seeking
to
implement
that
policy.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
feel
that
the
board
failed
to
find
that
the
union--
the
conduct
was
designed
to
coerce
a
neutral,
to
take
action
which
is
economically
detrimental
to
him.
we
believe
that
8
(b)--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
believe
that
the
purpose
of
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
is
to
prevent
unions
from
coercing
neutral
employers
to
take
actions
which
hurt
them.
let’s
take
an
ex--
mr.
laurence
gold
the
finding
should
have
been,
as
to
them,
that
the
union
wanted
them
to
either
stop
doing
business
with
white
or
to
take
some
other--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
they
all
three--
i
think
all
four
were
doing
business
together.
there
was
a
general
and
three
subcontractors
work--
mr.
laurence
gold
either
to
stop
doing
business
with
white
or
to
take--
to
make
some
change
in
their
relationship
with
white
which
would
harm
them
in--
economically,
in
their
pocketbook.
if
all
the
union
does
is
go
to
a
neutral
and
ask
him
to
use
his
good
offices
or
his
influence
with
the--
with--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
is
the
means.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
the
means
to
one
end,
o
the
ending
to
get
white
to
give
them
the
work,
and
that
being
the
only
end.
in
other
words,
if
means
were
sufficient
in
themselves,
you
would
never
have
to
look
to
what
the
union
hoped
to
accomplish.
every
time
there
was
a
secondary
strike,
the
board
would
be
home
free.
mr.
laurence
gold
they
would
have
to
be--
certainly,
if
they
wanted
them
to
give
up
their
contract
and
to
get
off
the
job,
that
would
hurt
them
economically.
if
they
ask
them
to
give
up
some
work
that
they
were
doing
and
give
it
to
white,
that
would
hurt
them
economically.
something
has
to
be
shown
that
the
union
wants
the
neutral
to
do
something
which
hurts
him
economically.
we
believe
that
that
is
what
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
was
intended.
that
is
its
purpose.
if
that
wasn’t
its
purpose,
good
many
things
become
inexplicable.
first,
why
did
congress
talk
in
terms
of
means
and
objects?
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
go
somewhat
too
far.
i
think
that
its
view
has
a
kernel
of
soundness.
it
saw
the
defect
in
the
board.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
we
do.
we
rest
much
more
strongly
on
judge
prettyman’s
view
in
the
retail
clerks
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
we
believe
that
both
judge
prettyman
and
the
third
circuit
were
looking
towards
the
same
defect
in
the
board’s
reasoning.
in
other
words,
we
think
the
defect
is
that
the
board
is
seeking
to
read
objects
completely
out
of
the
act
and
find
that
secondary
conduct
and
secondary
boycotts
are
synonymous.
and,
we
believe
that
that’s
absolutely
incorrect
and
we
think
that
judge
prettyman
has
pulled
them
up
short
and
the
third
circuit
has
as
well,
but
we
believe
the
judge
prettyman
did
it
correctly
and
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit,
while
diagnosing
the
evil
problem,
may
well
have
gone
too
far.
now,
i
see
that
it’s
two
minutes
past
three
and
that
i
have
some
time
should--
mr.
laurence
gold
should
i
finish
at
this
time?
i
want
to
especially
note
the
applicability
here
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
opinion
in
sandor.
as
i
started
to
say,
we
think
that
two
quite
separate
problems
in
this
area.
one
is
the
primary-secondary
dichotomy.
the
second
is
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
secondary
conduct
and
secondary
boycotts.
we
believe
that
this
court,
starting
with
sandor
and
going
through
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
jacksonville
terminal,
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
distinction.
and,
sandor
is
especially
important
because
that
was,
as
we
read
it,
a
case
where
there
was
no
primary
aspect.
there’s
a
footnote
saying
that
there
was
a
contention
of
primary
activity
and
that
it
was
rejected,
and
all
that
was
in
issue--
mr.
laurence
gold
it
was,
your
honor,
a
hot
cargo
case.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
and
the
question
was
whether
both
means,
illegal
means
and
an
illegal
object,
had
been
shown.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
that
is
the
way
mr.
justice
frankfurter
analyzes
the
problem,
recognizing
that
the
conduct
was
secondary.
he
then
says
“do
we
have
both
illegal
means
and
an
illegal
object?”
and
he
finds
that,
in
that
case,
there
was
a
violation.
now,
however,
there
was
a
caveat
in
that
case
that
hot
cargo
agreements
in
it
of
themselves
were
not
illegal,
so
that
he
didn’t
completely
take
out
the
ability
to
use
certain
means
to
reach
a
clearly
illegal
object.
congress
responded
to
that
in
1959
by
leaving
the
structure
of
the
statute
the
same.
it
seems
to
us,
that
by
doing
so,
they
agreed
that
means
and
objects
had
to
be
shown,
but
they
reacted
by
broadening
the
prohibitions
against
means
to
accomplish
the
end
that
they
sought,
which
was
to
close
a
particular
loophole.
so,
we
think--
mr.
laurence
gold
congress?
mr.
laurence
gold
in
8
(b)
4
(b)?
mr.
laurence
gold
we
believe
they
intended
to
make
it
illegal
for
a
union
to
coerce
an
employer
to
take
ac--
to
coerce
a
neutral
employer
to
take
action
which
was
economically
detrimental
to
him,
such
as
seizing
to
do
business
with
someone
else,
the
assumption
in
our
economy
being
that
doing
business
with
someone
is
an
indication
that
the
relationship
is
advantageous
to
both
sides.
i
just
want
to
note,
in
concluding
probably
the
two
basic
points
i
want
to
make,
i
want
to
note
that,
in
concluding,
that
we
don’t
think
that
denver
building
trades
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case
other
than
the
fact
that
both
arose
at
a
work
site.
the
findings
which
we
note
in
our
brief
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
only
thing
that
denver
building
trade’s
counsel
wanted
was
this
electrical
subcontractor
off
the
job
because
he
was
a
thorn
in
their
side
and
they
were
going
to
try
to
drive
him
out
of
business.
the
board’s
findings
make
that
perfectly
plain.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
we’ve--
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
and
we
think
that
the
problem
is,
in
drawing
the
line,
the
board
is
trying
to
get
away
from
that
by
cutting
out
the
whole
problem
and
saying
wherever
you
ask
for
a
change
in
the
relationship,
they
can
find
that
you
have
violated
section
8
(b)
4,
that
they
don’t
have
to
find
any
object
to
harm
the
neutral
in
his
economic
situation.
and,
i
also
want
to
say
that,
in
disagreement
with--
mr.
laurence
gold
we
haven’t
cited
any
legislative
history
on
the
meaning
of
cessation
to
do
business
because
we
couldn’t
find
any--
mr.
laurence
gold
what
we
do
is--
our
argument
really
is
based
on
the
language
the
congress
used
of
the
reasonable
emanations
of
that
language
and
the
fact
that
a
reading
broader
than
one
we
would
give,
it
would
knock
out
or
make
nugatory
certain
other
provision
of
the
act,
and
we
believe
that
this
is
the
most
rational
meaning
that
we
can
give.
finally,
i
want
to
note
that
the
erie
resistor
argument
which
is
made
by
the
board
is
barred
by
chancery.
i
hate
to
disagree
with
the
general
counsel.
it
is
true
that
the
board
cited
a
case
called
local
3ivw
in
deter--
in
stating
why
it
was
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
here,
but
that
case
is
simply
one
which
states
that
anything--
that
any
request
of
an
employer
for
a
change
in
business
is
illegal
per
se
under
section
8
(b)
4,
and
the
board--
that
case
really
demonstrates
that--
why
the
board
would
never
have
turned
to
erie
resistor,
because
its
per
se
theory
makes
erie
resistor
which
is
one
about
drawing
inferences
irrelevant.
and,
we
think
that
this
is
a
demonstration
by
board
counsel
that
they
recognize
the
weakness
of
the
board’s
opinion
and
the
board’s
approach
in
this
case.
we
think
it’s
barred.
we
think
it
would
have
the
most
drastic
consequences.
thank
you.
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
best
if

mr.

by
the

take--
to
make
some
change
in
their
relationship
with
white
which
would
harm
them
in--
economically,
in
their
pocketbook.
if
all
the
union
does
is
go
to
a
neutral
and
ask
him
to
use
his
good
offices
or
his
influence
with
the--
with--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
is
the
means.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
the
means
to
one
end,
o
the
ending
to
get
white
to
give
them
the
work,
and
that
being
the
only
end.
in
other
words,
if
means
were
sufficient
in
themselves,
you
would
never
have
to
look
to
what
the
union
hoped
to
accomplish.
every
time
there
was
a
secondary
strike,
the
board
would
be
home
free.
mr.
laurence
gold
they
would
have
to
be--
certainly,
if
they
wanted
them
to
give
up
their
contract
and
to
get
off
the
job,
that
would
hurt
them
economically.
if
they
ask
them
to
give
up
some
work
that
they
were
doing
and
give
it
to
white,
that
would
hurt
them
economically.
something
has
to
be
shown
that
the
union
wants
the
neutral
to
do
something
which
hurts
him
economically.
we
believe
that
that
is
what
section
8
(b)
4
(b)
was
intended.
that
is
its
purpose.
if
that
wasn’t
its
purpose,
good
many
things
become
inexplicable.
first,
why
did
congress
talk
in
terms
of
means
and
objects?
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
go
somewhat
too
far.
i
think
that
its
view
has
a
kernel
of
soundness.
it
saw
the
defect
in
the
board.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
we
do.
we
rest
much
more
strongly
on
judge
prettyman’s
view
in
the
retail
clerks
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
we
believe
that
both
judge
prettyman
and
the
third
circuit
were
looking
towards
the
same
defect
in
the
board’s
reasoning.
in
other
words,
we
think
the
defect
is
that
the
board
is
seeking
to
read
objects
completely
out
of
the
act
and
find
that
secondary
conduct
and
secondary
boycotts
are
synonymous.
and,
we
believe
that
that’s
absolutely
incorrect
and
we
think
that
judge
prettyman
has
pulled
them
up
short
and
the
third
circuit
has
as
well,
but
we
believe
the
judge
prettyman
did
it
correctly
and
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit,
while
diagnosing
the
evil
problem,
may
well
have
gone
too
far.
now,
i
see
that
it’s
two
minutes
past
three
and
that
i
have
some
time
should--
mr.
laurence
gold
should
i
finish
at
this
time?
i
want
to
especially
note
the
applicability
here
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
opinion
in
sandor.
as
i
started
to
say,
we
think
that
two
quite
separate
problems
in
this
area.
one
is
the
primary-secondary
dichotomy.
the
second
is
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
secondary
conduct
and
secondary
boycotts.
we
believe
that
this
court,
starting
with
sandor
and
going
through
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
jacksonville
terminal,
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
distinction.
and,
sandor
is
especially
important
because
that
was,
as
we
read
it,
a
case
where
there
was
no
primary
aspect.
there’s
a
footnote
saying
that
there
was
a
contention
of
primary
activity
and
that
it
was
rejected,
and
all
that
was
in
issue--
mr.
laurence
gold
it
was,
your
honor,
a
hot
cargo
case.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
and
the
question
was
whether
both
means,
illegal
means
and
an
illegal
object,
had
been
shown.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
that
is
the
way
mr.
justice
frankfurter
analyzes
the
problem,
recognizing
that
the
conduct
was
secondary.
he
then
says
“do
we
have
both
illegal
means
and
an
illegal
object?”
and
he
finds
that,
in
that
case,
there
was
a
violation.
now,
however,
there
was
a
caveat
in
that
case
that
hot
cargo
agreements
in
it
of
themselves
were
not
illegal,
so
that
he
didn’t
completely
take
out
the
ability
to
use
certain
means
to
reach
a
clearly
illegal
object.
congress
responded
to
that
in
1959
by
leaving
the
structure
of
the
statute
the
same.
it
seems
to
us,
that
by
doing
so,
they
agreed
that
means
and
objects
had
to
be
shown,
but
they
reacted
by
broadening
the
prohibitions
against
means
to
accomplish
the
end
that
they
sought,
which
was
to
close
a
particular
loophole.
so,
we
think--
mr.
laurence
gold
congress?
mr.
laurence
gold
in
8
(b)
4
(b)?
mr.
laurence
gold
we
believe
they
intended
to
make
it
illegal
for
a
union
to
coerce
an
employer
to
take
ac--
to
coerce
a
neutral
employer
to
take
action
which
was
economically
detrimental
to
him,
such
as
seizing
to
do
business
with
someone
else,
the
assumption
in
our
economy
being
that
doing
business
with
someone
is
an
indication
that
the
relationship
is
advantageous
to
both
sides.
i
just
want
to
note,
in
concluding
probably
the
two
basic
points
i
want
to
make,
i
want
to
note
that,
in
concluding,
that
we
don’t
think
that
denver
building
trades
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case
other
than
the
fact
that
both
arose
at
a
work
site.
the
findings
which
we
note
in
our
brief
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
only
thing
that
denver
building
trade’s
counsel
wanted
was
this
electrical
subcontractor
off
the
job
because
he
was
a
thorn
in
their
side
and
they
were
going
to
try
to
drive
him
out
of
business.
the
board’s
findings
make
that
perfectly
plain.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
we’ve--
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
and
we
think
that
the
problem
is,
in
drawing
the
line,
the
board
is
trying
to
get
away
from
that
by
cutting
out
the
whole
problem
and
saying
wherever
you
ask
for
a
change
in
the
relationship,
they
can
find
that
you
have
violated
section
8
(b)
4,
that
they
don’t
have
to
find
any
object
to
harm
the
neutral
in
his
economic
situation.
and,
i
also
want
to
say
that,
in
disagreement
with--
mr.
laurence
gold
we
haven’t
cited
any
legislative
history
on
the
meaning
of
cessation
to
do
business
because
we
couldn’t
find
any--
mr.
laurence
gold
what
we
do
is--
our
argument
really
is
based
on
the
language
the
congress
used
of
the
reasonable
emanations
of
that
language
and
the
fact
that
a
reading
broader
than
one
we
would
give,
it
would
knock
out
or
make
nugatory
certain
other
provision
of
the
act,
and
we
believe
that
this
is
the
most
rational
meaning
that
we
can
give.
finally,
i
want
to
note
that
the
erie
resistor
argument
which
is
made
by
the
board
is
barred
by
chancery.
i
hate
to
disagree
with
the
general
counsel.
it
is
true
that
the
board
cited
a
case
called
local
3ivw
in
deter--
in
stating
why
it
was
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
here,
but
that
case
is
simply
one
which
states
that
anything--
that
any
request
of
an
employer
for
a
change
in
business
is
illegal
per
se
under
section
8
(b)
4,
and
the
board--
that
case
really
demonstrates
that--
why
the
board
would
never
have
turned
to
erie
resistor,
because
its
per
se
theory
makes
erie
resistor
which
is
one
about
drawing
inferences
irrelevant.
and,
we
think
that
this
is
a
demonstration
by
board
counsel
that
they
recognize
the
weakness
of
the
board’s
opinion
and
the
board’s
approach
in
this
case.
we
think
it’s
barred.
we
think
it
would
have
the
most
drastic
consequences.
thank
you.
