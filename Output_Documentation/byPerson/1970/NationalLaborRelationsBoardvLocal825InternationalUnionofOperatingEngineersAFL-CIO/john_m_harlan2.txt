what
form
do
the

do
you

the

justice
john
m.

well,
i
was
just
wondering.
this
is
a
pure
question
of
law,
isn’t
it,
as
to
what
the
statute--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
on
the
1959
justice
john
m.
harlan
both?
justice

denver
building
was
decided
before
the
1959
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
thereafter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
the--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
the
amendments
that
congress
made
to
this
legislation
in
1959
have
any
real
relevance
to
the
question
here
or
is
it--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
would’ve
been
on
the
same
side
of
the
case
between
1947
and
1959.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
the
inanimate

has
no
real--
justice
john
m.
harlan
bearing
on
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
pertinent
to
inquire
what
the
situation
is
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
all
the
differences
were
just
composed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
moots
the
case
and
i
can’t?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
an
argument
involving
the
contract
to
be
applied
as
a
primary?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
other
subcontractors?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
gather
the
strike’s
primarily
a
variable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
only
conduct
related
to
burns
was
the
approach
to
burns
to
decide
to
sign
the

is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
work
stoppages
would
be
of
the
employees
of
the
other
two
subcontractors.

justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
less

justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
there
must
be
a
contract
whether
if
it’s
cheated
or
not,
and
an
object
clause,
complete
cessation.
justice
john
m.
