mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
justice
harlan,
may
i
indicate
that
this
project
was
phase
i
of
the
jersey
central
power
and
lights
power
plant
construction
at
that
location.
they
are
still
in
the
process
of
developing
some
permanent
water
discharge
lines
to
this
project,
and
phase
ii
is
about
to
start
within
the
next
couple
of
months.
moreover,
the
broad
secondary
relief
that
is
outstanding
against
this
union
in
third
circuit
orders,
which
the
third
circuit
has
found
this
union
in
contempt
of
continue
and,
consequently,
this
is
a
continuing
question
of
significance
not
only
in
this
dispute,
but
to
the
entire
broad
question
of
secondary
conduct
generally.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
no,
it
is
a
matter
of
acute
controversy,
mr.
justice
black,
with
regard
to
conduct
that
may
be
considered
secondary.
i
think,
perhaps
what
mr.
ordman
meant
to
suggest
was
that
the
underlying
jurisdictional
controversy
with
regard
to
electric
welding
machines
has
been
resolved.
we
have
an
affirmative
decision
on
that
by
the
joint
board
which
is
the
equivalent
of
a
10k
determination
by
the
nlrb.
consequently,
that
specific
type
of
controversy
is
resolved,
but
the
secondary
boycott
conduct
of
this
union,
which
it
has
continually
engaged
in
over
the
years,
is
still
important
and
it
still
is
outstanding
a
broad
third
circuit
court
injunction
prohibiting--
a
permanent
injunction
prohibiting
secondary
conduct.
so
that,
the
question
involved
here
is
most
significant
with
regard
to
that
outstanding
secondary
boycott
order
in
other
cases,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
and
for
all
future
violations
that
come
under
the
ambit
of
this
section
of
the
law.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
the
union
will
be
affected,
as
will
all
unions,
in
the
whole
area
of
the
law,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
well
as
i
indicated,
mr.
justice
white,
the
power
plant
construction
by
jersey
central
power
and
light
has
various
phases.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
the
only
thing
on
appeal
here.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
no,
the
secondary
boycott
order
is
a
very
broad
order.
it’s
the
broadest
that
can
be
issued
by
the
third
circuit
court
or
the
board.
it
applies
as
against
any
employer,
as
yet
unnamed
employers,
sir,
because
of
the
nlrb’s
position
that
this
union
had
demonstrated
a
proclivity
to
violate
the
act.
so,
consequently,
the
nlrb
orders
outstanding
against
this
union
are
what
we
term
broad
orders.
they
have
been
enforced
by
the
third
circuit
and
at
least
two
cases,
the
united
engineers
case
quoted
in
our
brief
and
a
consent
decree
entered
into
by
the
union
in
1966
and,
consequently,
they
are
outstanding
orders
currently
and
we
must,
i
would
suggest,
have
an
answer
to
this
type
of
controversy
in
order
to
find
out
the
efficacy
of
those
outstanding
orders.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
no,
sir.
there
is
no
outstanding--
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes,
the
statute
does
provide
section
303
is--
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
they
could,
independently
of
how
this
case
is
decided,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
law
on
the
subject,
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
8
(b)
4
(b)
is
not
res
judicata
on
a
section
303
suit
for
damages
which
includes
the
identical
language.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
well,
i
would
say
so,
but
there
is--
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
well,
let
me
point
out,
sir,
i
have
represented
burns
&
roe
since
the
inception
of
this
matter.
no
damage
suit
has
been
instated
nor
is
one
contemplated.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes,
sir?
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
i
think
it
would
be
inadmissible
in
that
damage
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
that’s
correct,
sir.
as
mr.
ordman
has
pointed
out,
the
cessation
of
business
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
at
the
heart
of
the
third
circuit
opinion
and
i
would
submit
that
the
third
circuit
was
very
conscious
of
its
narrow
interpretation
of
this
language
because,
in
its
opinion,
it
alludes
to
and
cites
for
comparison
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
a
carpenter’s
district
council
of
new
orleans
which
we
have
cited,
and
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course,
adopts
the
board
ruling
that
something
less
than
a
total
cancellation
of
business
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
provisionally,
as
i
understand
and
read
that
decision
in
the
third
circuit,
it
would
virtually
make,
as
the
third
circuit
has
interpreted
this
statute,
the
evidentiary
standard
of
demonstrating
an
unlawful
object
virtually
impossible.
i
think
the
courts
and
the
board
have
held
many
times
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
conduct
and
not
its
effect.
there
can
be
an
unlawful
inducement.
there
can
be
unlawful
thread
with
an
improper
object
that
does
not
meet
with
success.
however
it
is,
nonetheless,
unlawful,
and
i
would
point
to
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
general
electric
case
in
which
this
court
said
that,
in
the
absence
of
admissions
by
the
union
of
an
illegal
intent,
the
nature
of
acts
performed
shows
the
intent.
it
cannot
be
gain
said,
of
course,
that
a
union
hardly
will
step
forward
and
admit
illegal
intent,
but
i
think
the
courts
and
the
board,
over
the
years,
have
developed
reasonable
criteria
and
reasonable
methods
of
finding
out
what
this
intent
is
and
it
is
demonstrated
by
that
citation
adopted
by
this
court
in
general
electric.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
development
of
our
labor
law,
if
we
look
to
the
pre-norris-laguardia
type
of
labor
disputes,
with
the
use
of
injunctive
power
that
has
been
criticized
in
the
development
of
our
law,
we
then
look
to
norris-laguardia
which
endeavored
to
stop
that
type
of
abuse
of
judicial
injunctive
process.
then,
we
have
to
have
taft-hartley
which,
if
the
court
please,
carved
out
certain
conduct
which
was
proscribed
by
congress,
subsequently,
landrum-griffin.
i
submit
that
the
purpose
in
the
development
of
all
of
this
law
was
to
confine
the
area
of
industrial
conflict.
the
purpose
was
to
reduce
or
minimize
the
disruption
of
commerce.
in
a
same
fashion,
the
boy’s
market
decision
of
this
court
in
june
of
this
year
endeavors
to
do
that.
so
that,
consequently,
we
find
the
emphasis
in
the
development
of
our
labor
law
an
effort
to
confine
the
conflict
and
i
would
submit
that
if
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
were
adopted
here,
it
would
so
enlarge
the
battle
field
as
to
undo
the
years
of
development
of
this
law,
the
legislative
history,
the
intent
of
congress.
indeed,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
building
trade
unions
have
tried
perennially
to
obtain
a
common
situs
bill
in
congress
that
would
allow
the
very
type
of
conduct
engaged
in
here
has
turned
back
that
effort
each
time
and,
consequently,
the
third
circuit
position,
it
seems
to
me,
should
be
rejected.
the
union
has
available
to
it
the
collective
bargaining--
free
collective
bargaining
process.
in
that
process,
it
has
available
to
it
arbitration.
the
joint
board
for
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes
is
a
type
of
arbitration.
it
has
been
so
held
the
union
in
this
instance,
as
mr.
ordman
points
out,
rejected
that
procedure
though
bound
by
it,
rejected
the
conclusion
of
that
body
though
bound
by
it,
and
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
injunctive
relief
for
the
enforcement
of
that
type
of
award.
moreover,
not
only
did
it
reject
the
arbitration
procedure
and
result
it
was
bound
by,
but
it
did
so
by
engaging
in
coercive
activities
against
neutrals,
not
involved
in
the
controversy.
poirier
&
mclane
had
no
dispute
with
the
union.
chicago
bridge
had
no
dispute
with
the
union.
burns
&
roe
had
no
dispute
with
the
union.
consequently,
if
we
squarely
recognize
the
realities
of
the
construction
industry,
here,
we
see
a
$68-million
project
where
30
men
operating
engineers
all
refuse
to
work,
leave
their
equipment
and,
by
their
refusal,
bring
to
an
absolute
standstill
a
project
employing
some-300
men.
obviously,
the
statute
is
designed
not
only
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
neutral
employers.
it
was
also
intended
to
protect
the
rights
of
their
employees.
this
dislocation--
this
massive
dislocation
also
causes
injury
to
these
other
employees.
i
would
submit
that
there
were
only
three
alternatives
available
with
regard
to
the
union
conduct.
one
of
them
was
the
parties
could’ve
remained
adamant.
no
one
would’ve
changed
their
stand
and,
perhaps,
the
project
might
not
be
completed.
in
the
absence
of
injunctive
relief,
the
project
would
not
have
resumed,
except
for
that
injunctive
relief
in
the
manner
that
it
was
proceeding.
the
other
alternative
was
to
terminate
the
contract
of
white
construction.
that
is
not
as
simple
a
thing
as
it
sounds.
certainly,
in
sophisticated
types
of
construction
such
as
a
nuclear
plant,
it
is
not
a
simple
thing
to
switch
horses,
midstream.
there
are
all
types
of
problems
with
regard
to
competence,
personnel,
planning,
approval
of
drawings.
the
other
alternative,
of
course,
was
to
exert
this
pressure
until
the
union
had
the
white
construction
company
bend
to
its
will,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasonable
course
here
dictates
in
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
deal
with
the
normal
type
of
dispute,
the
interdiction
or,
if
you
will,
the
disruption
of
business
designed
to
put
pressure
on
people
who
could
bring
about
a
change.
these
are
the
neutrals
that
are
to
be
protected.
the
respondent’s
brief
relies
upon
two
cases
rather
heavily,
the
miller
case
and
the
wed
nagle
case.
with
regard
to
miller,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
case
is
in
opposite.
the
miller
case,
if
we
read
the
language
of
it
clearly,
indicates
that
that
merely
was
an
effort
by
a
union
to
tell
a
general
contractor
that
if
a
painting
subcontractor
continued
to
resort
to
the
use
of
spray-painting
it
would
picket
the
job
and
clearly
indicate
that
its
dispute
was
with
the
primary.
that
case
did
not
involve
secondary
activity.
in
that
opinion,
it
was
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
superintendent
of
the
general
contractor
admitted
that
the
union
agent
never
specifically
asked
him
to
remove
miller
from
the
job
or
take
any
other
definitive
action
in
regard
to
miller.
we
said
that
that
case
is
in
opposite.
with
regard
to
wed
nagle,
wed
nagle
was
a
seventh
circuit
decision.
wed
nagle
was
decided
in
1958,
i
think
as
our
brief
cites,
the
seventh
circuit
has
rejected
that
approach.
we
cite
the
pure
milk
decision,
which
is
a
seventh
circuit
decision,
decided
in
1964
and
i
would
call
the
court’s
particular
attention
to
the
italics
in
a
quotation
in
our
brief
at
page
26
in
which
the
seventh
circuit
says
“less
than
a
total
cessation
of
an
existing
business
relationship
is
within
the
meaning
of
seize
doing
business.”
consequently,
we
would
submit
that
the
wood
neagle
case
is
rejected
authority.
obviously,
when
a
union
engages
in
this
conduct,
it
may
have
several
objects
and
we
have
cited
the
cases
talking
about
those
decisions
which
have
immediate
alternative
conditional
or
ultimate
objects.
the
point
that
mr.
ordman
makes
is
quite
right.
the
legislative
history
shows
clearly
that
the
language
of
“the
purpose
of”
was
substituted
with
the
language
of
“an
object”
and,
consequently,
the
broader
language
has
application.
with
regard
to
the
contention
made
by
the
respondents
that
8
(b)
4
(d)
is
involved
here
and,
therefore,
we
should
not
have
an
8
(b)
4
(b)
charge.
needless
to
say,
the
8
(b)
4
(b)
section,
the
secondary
boycott
section,
involves
mandatory
injunctive
powers
as
opposed
to
discretionary.
there’s
a
section
303
suit
that
can
be
instituted
by
anyone
who
is
injured
by
secondary
conduct,
irrespective
of
a
contractual
relationship
which
underscores
congress’
concern
for
neutrals
and
underscores
its
concern
for
prevention
of
a
disruption
of
commerce.
moreover,
after
a
10k
award
under
nlrb
procedures,
an
injunction
may
be
dissolved,
whereas
in
secondary
boycott
matters,
the
injunction
becomes
permanent.
this
case,
i
would
submit,
is
like
the
denver
building
trades
case.
we
have
the
pressures
brought
to
bear
on
a
general
and
other
subs
to
have
white
change
its
course,
to
have
white
change
the
method
by
which
it
was
doing
business.
this,
indeed,
was
a
longstanding
dispute,
has
been
a
longstanding
dispute
between
local
825
and
other
employers.
there
are
cases,
the
building
contractors
case
of
1957
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
moore
pipe
decision
in
1962,
the
building
contractors
again
in
1964,
and
moore
interaction
in
1967.
all
of
these
secondary
boycott
cases
involved
the
welding
machine
and
i
would
submit
as
well
that
there
have
been
two
contempts
found
by
the
third
circuit
with
regard
to
violation
of
its
order
on
secondary
boycotts
by
this
union
on
welding
machines.
in
short,
i
would
conclude
that
the
nature
of
the
construction
industry
is
such
that,
without
applying
the
sound
principles
of
denver
building
trades
and
all
of
the
decision
subsequent,
it
would
unduly
enlarge
the
battlefield
and
grant
to
construction
unions
what
they
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
to
the
common
situs
legislation.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
justice
harlan,
may
i
indicate
that
this
project
was
phase
i
of
the
jersey
central
power
and
lights
power
plant
construction
at
that
location.
they
are
still
in
the
process
of
developing
some
permanent
water
discharge
lines
to
this
project,
and
phase
ii
is
about
to
start
within
the
next
couple
of
months.
moreover,
the
broad
secondary
relief
that
is
outstanding
against
this
union
in
third
circuit
orders,
which
the
third
circuit
has
found
this
union
in
contempt
of
continue
and,
consequently,
this
is
a
continuing
question
of
significance
not
only
in
this
dispute,
but
to
the
entire
broad
question
of
secondary
conduct
generally.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
no,
it
is
a
matter
of
acute
controversy,
mr.
justice
black,
with
regard
to
conduct
that
may
be
considered
secondary.
i
think,
perhaps
what
mr.
ordman
meant
to
suggest
was
that
the
underlying
jurisdictional
controversy
with
regard
to
electric
welding
machines
has
been
resolved.
we
have
an
affirmative
decision
on
that
by
the
joint
board
which
is
the
equivalent
of
a
10k
determination
by
the
nlrb.
consequently,
that
specific
type
of
controversy
is
resolved,
but
the
secondary
boycott
conduct
of
this
union,
which
it
has
continually
engaged
in
over
the
years,
is
still
important
and
it
still
is
outstanding
a
broad
third
circuit
court
injunction
prohibiting--
a
permanent
injunction
prohibiting
secondary
conduct.
so
that,
the
question
involved
here
is
most
significant
with
regard
to
that
outstanding
secondary
boycott
order
in
other
cases,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
and
for
all
future
violations
that
come
under
the
ambit
of
this
section
of
the
law.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
the
union
will
be
affected,
as
will
all
unions,
in
the
whole
area
of
the
law,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
well
as
i
indicated,
mr.
justice
white,
the
power
plant
construction
by
jersey
central
power
and
light
has
various
phases.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
the
only
thing
on
appeal
here.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
no,
the
secondary
boycott
order
is
a
very
broad
order.
it’s
the
broadest
that
can
be
issued
by
the
third
circuit
court
or
the
board.
it
applies
as
against
any
employer,
as
yet
unnamed
employers,
sir,
because
of
the
nlrb’s
position
that
this
union
had
demonstrated
a
proclivity
to
violate
the
act.
so,
consequently,
the
nlrb
orders
outstanding
against
this
union
are
what
we
term
broad
orders.
they
have
been
enforced
by
the
third
circuit
and
at
least
two
cases,
the
united
engineers
case
quoted
in
our
brief
and
a
consent
decree
entered
into
by
the
union
in
1966
and,
consequently,
they
are
outstanding
orders
currently
and
we
must,
i
would
suggest,
have
an
answer
to
this
type
of
controversy
in
order
to
find
out
the
efficacy
of
those
outstanding
orders.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
no,
sir.
there
is
no
outstanding--
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes,
the
statute
does
provide
section
303
is--
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
they
could,
independently
of
how
this
case
is
decided,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
law
on
the
subject,
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
8
(b)
4
(b)
is
not
res
judicata
on
a
section
303
suit
for
damages
which
includes
the
identical
language.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
well,
i
would
say
so,
but
there
is--
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
well,
let
me
point
out,
sir,
i
have
represented
burns
&
roe
since
the
inception
of
this
matter.
no
damage
suit
has
been
instated
nor
is
one
contemplated.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes,
sir?
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
i
think
it
would
be
inadmissible
in
that
damage
suit,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
apruzzese
that’s
correct,
sir.
as
mr.
ordman
has
pointed
out,
the
cessation
of
business
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
at
the
heart
of
the
third
circuit
opinion
and
i
would
submit
that
the
third
circuit
was
very
conscious
of
its
narrow
interpretation
of
this
language
because,
in
its
opinion,
it
alludes
to
and
cites
for
comparison
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
a
carpenter’s
district
council
of
new
orleans
which
we
have
cited,
and
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course,
adopts
the
board
ruling
that
something
less
than
a
total
cancellation
of
business
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
provisionally,
as
i
understand
and
read
that
decision
in
the
third
circuit,
it
would
virtually
make,
as
the
third
circuit
has
interpreted
this
statute,
the
evidentiary
standard
of
demonstrating
an
unlawful
object
virtually
impossible.
i
think
the
courts
and
the
board
have
held
many
times
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
conduct
and
not
its
effect.
there
can
be
an
unlawful
inducement.
there
can
be
unlawful
thread
with
an
improper
object
that
does
not
meet
with
success.
however
it
is,
nonetheless,
unlawful,
and
i
would
point
to
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
general
electric
case
in
which
this
court
said
that,
in
the
absence
of
admissions
by
the
union
of
an
illegal
intent,
the
nature
of
acts
performed
shows
the
intent.
it
cannot
be
gain
said,
of
course,
that
a
union
hardly
will
step
forward
and
admit
illegal
intent,
but
i
think
the
courts
and
the
board,
over
the
years,
have
developed
reasonable
criteria
and
reasonable
methods
of
finding
out
what
this
intent
is
and
it
is
demonstrated
by
that
citation
adopted
by
this
court
in
general
electric.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
development
of
our
labor
law,
if
we
look
to
the
pre-norris-laguardia
type
of
labor
disputes,
with
the
use
of
injunctive
power
that
has
been
criticized
in
the
development
of
our
law,
we
then
look
to
norris-laguardia
which
endeavored
to
stop
that
type
of
abuse
of
judicial
injunctive
process.
then,
we
have
to
have
taft-hartley
which,
if
the
court
please,
carved
out
certain
conduct
which
was
proscribed
by
congress,
subsequently,
landrum-griffin.
i
submit
that
the
purpose
in
the
development
of
all
of
this
law
was
to
confine
the
area
of
industrial
conflict.
the
purpose
was
to
reduce
or
minimize
the
disruption
of
commerce.
in
a
same
fashion,
the
boy’s
market
decision
of
this
court
in
june
of
this
year
endeavors
to
do
that.
so
that,
consequently,
we
find
the
emphasis
in
the
development
of
our
labor
law
an
effort
to
confine
the
conflict
and
i
would
submit
that
if
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
were
adopted
here,
it
would
so
enlarge
the
battle
field
as
to
undo
the
years
of
development
of
this
law,
the
legislative
history,
the
intent
of
congress.
indeed,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
building
trade
unions
have
tried
perennially
to
obtain
a
common
situs
bill
in
congress
that
would
allow
the
very
type
of
conduct
engaged
in
here
has
turned
back
that
effort
each
time
and,
consequently,
the
third
circuit
position,
it
seems
to
me,
should
be
rejected.
the
union
has
available
to
it
the
collective
bargaining--
free
collective
bargaining
process.
in
that
process,
it
has
available
to
it
arbitration.
the
joint
board
for
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes
is
a
type
of
arbitration.
it
has
been
so
held
the
union
in
this
instance,
as
mr.
ordman
points
out,
rejected
that
procedure
though
bound
by
it,
rejected
the
conclusion
of
that
body
though
bound
by
it,
and
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
injunctive
relief
for
the
enforcement
of
that
type
of
award.
moreover,
not
only
did
it
reject
the
arbitration
procedure
and
result
it
was
bound
by,
but
it
did
so
by
engaging
in
coercive
activities
against
neutrals,
not
involved
in
the
controversy.
poirier
&
mclane
had
no
dispute
with
the
union.
chicago
bridge
had
no
dispute
with
the
union.
burns
&
roe
had
no
dispute
with
the
union.
consequently,
if
we
squarely
recognize
the
realities
of
the
construction
industry,
here,
we
see
a
$68-million
project
where
30
men
operating
engineers
all
refuse
to
work,
leave
their
equipment
and,
by
their
refusal,
bring
to
an
absolute
standstill
a
project
employing
some-300
men.
obviously,
the
statute
is
designed
not
only
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
neutral
employers.
it
was
also
intended
to
protect
the
rights
of
their
employees.
this
dislocation--
this
massive
dislocation
also
causes
injury
to
these
other
employees.
i
would
submit
that
there
were
only
three
alternatives
available
with
regard
to
the
union
conduct.
one
of
them
was
the
parties
could’ve
remained
adamant.
no
one
would’ve
changed
their
stand
and,
perhaps,
the
project
might
not
be
completed.
in
the
absence
of
injunctive
relief,
the
project
would
not
have
resumed,
except
for
that
injunctive
relief
in
the
manner
that
it
was
proceeding.
the
other
alternative
was
to
terminate
the
contract
of
white
construction.
that
is
not
as
simple
a
thing
as
it
sounds.
certainly,
in
sophisticated
types
of
construction
such
as
a
nuclear
plant,
it
is
not
a
simple
thing
to
switch
horses,
midstream.
there
are
all
types
of
problems
with
regard
to
competence,
personnel,
planning,
approval
of
drawings.
the
other
alternative,
of
course,
was
to
exert
this
pressure
until
the
union
had
the
white
construction
company
bend
to
its
will,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasonable
course
here
dictates
in
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
deal
with
the
normal
type
of
dispute,
the
interdiction
or,
if
you
will,
the
disruption
of
business
designed
to
put
pressure
on
people
who
could
bring
about
a
change.
these
are
the
neutrals
that
are
to
be
protected.
the
respondent’s
brief
relies
upon
two
cases
rather
heavily,
the
miller
case
and
the
wed
nagle
case.
with
regard
to
miller,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
case
is
in
opposite.
the
miller
case,
if
we
read
the
language
of
it
clearly,
indicates
that
that
merely
was
an
effort
by
a
union
to
tell
a
general
contractor
that
if
a
painting
subcontractor
continued
to
resort
to
the
use
of
spray-painting
it
would
picket
the
job
and
clearly
indicate
that
its
dispute
was
with
the
primary.
that
case
did
not
involve
secondary
activity.
in
that
opinion,
it
was
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
superintendent
of
the
general
contractor
admitted
that
the
union
agent
never
specifically
asked
him
to
remove
miller
from
the
job
or
take
any
other
definitive
action
in
regard
to
miller.
we
said
that
that
case
is
in
opposite.
with
regard
to
wed
nagle,
wed
nagle
was
a
seventh
circuit
decision.
wed
nagle
was
decided
in
1958,
i
think
as
our
brief
cites,
the
seventh
circuit
has
rejected
that
approach.
we
cite
the
pure
milk
decision,
which
is
a
seventh
circuit
decision,
decided
in
1964
and
i
would
call
the
court’s
particular
attention
to
the
italics
in
a
quotation
in
our
brief
at
page
26
in
which
the
seventh
circuit
says
“less
than
a
total
cessation
of
an
existing
business
relationship
is
within
the
meaning
of
seize
doing
business.”
consequently,
we
would
submit
that
the
wood
neagle
case
is
rejected
authority.
obviously,
when
a
union
engages
in
this
conduct,
it
may
have
several
objects
and
we
have
cited
the
cases
talking
about
those
decisions
which
have
immediate
alternative
conditional
or
ultimate
objects.
the
point
that
mr.
ordman
makes
is
quite
right.
the
legislative
history
shows
clearly
that
the
language
of
“the
purpose
of”
was
substituted
with
the
language
of
“an
object”
and,
consequently,
the
broader
language
has
application.
with
regard
to
the
contention
made
by
the
respondents
that
8
(b)
4
(d)
is
involved
here
and,
therefore,
we
should
not
have
an
8
(b)
4
(b)
charge.
needless
to
say,
the
8
(b)
4
(b)
section,
the
secondary
boycott
section,
involves
mandatory
injunctive
powers
as
opposed
to
discretionary.
there’s
a
section
303
suit
that
can
be
instituted
by
anyone
who
is
injured
by
secondary
conduct,
irrespective
of
a
contractual
relationship
which
underscores
congress’
concern
for
neutrals
and
underscores
its
concern
for
prevention
of
a
disruption
of
commerce.
moreover,
after
a
10k
award
under
nlrb
procedures,
an
injunction
may
be
dissolved,
whereas
in
secondary
boycott
matters,
the
injunction
becomes
permanent.
this
case,
i
would
submit,
is
like
the
denver
building
trades
case.
we
have
the
pressures
brought
to
bear
on
a
general
and
other
subs
to
have
white
change
its
course,
to
have
white
change
the
method
by
which
it
was
doing
business.
this,
indeed,
was
a
longstanding
dispute,
has
been
a
longstanding
dispute
between
local
825
and
other
employers.
there
are
cases,
the
building
contractors
case
of
1957
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
moore
pipe
decision
in
1962,
the
building
contractors
again
in
1964,
and
moore
interaction
in
1967.
all
of
these
secondary
boycott
cases
involved
the
welding
machine
and
i
would
submit
as
well
that
there
have
been
two
contempts
found
by
the
third
circuit
with
regard
to
violation
of
its
order
on
secondary
boycotts
by
this
union
on
welding
machines.
in
short,
i
would
conclude
that
the
nature
of
the
construction
industry
is
such
that,
without
applying
the
sound
principles
of
denver
building
trades
and
all
of
the
decision
subsequent,
it
would
unduly
enlarge
the
battlefield
and
grant
to
construction
unions
what
they
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
to
the
common
situs
legislation.
