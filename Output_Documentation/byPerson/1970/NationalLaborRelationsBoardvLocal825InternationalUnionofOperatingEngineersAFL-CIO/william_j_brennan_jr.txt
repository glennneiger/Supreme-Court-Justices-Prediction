justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
course
the
board
took?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
board--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
board
cited
the
case
on
this
basis,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there--
what
is
it?
there’s
a
damage
action
or
some
kind
in
the
secondary
boycott
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
say
is--
doesn’t
the
statute
provide
for
a
damage
action
for
secondary--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
for
burns
&
roe,
if
this
is
reversed,
would
they
have
such
an
action
against
this
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not
be
res
judicata,
but
a
bit
rather
important--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
afterwards,
you
would
have
to
bring
an
action
against--
for
burns,
against
this
union,
if
we
reversed,
wouldn’t
you?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
wasn’t
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
was,
it
would
be
helpful
to
such
a
damage
suit
if
this
were
reversed,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
any
court
accept
your
proposition
that
circumstances
like
this
on
construction
jobs,
the
conduct
in
which
your
client
engages
is
always
primary
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
protected
actually.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
there’s
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
any
of
these
provisions
which
supports
that
argument
as
related
to
a
construction
site,
as
to--
that
this
conduct
is
always
primary
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually,
isn’t
it
quite
the
other
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you--
are
you
saying
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
too
far
in
its
definition
of
what
the
objective
had
to
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
it
was
in
effect.
its
view
was
that
the
statute
is
not
violated
unless
the
object
was
to
get
white
off
the
job.
in
effect,
that’s
what
it
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that’s
not
what
the
board
had
to
find.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
less
short
of
that
would
be
enough.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
gold,
has
your
plea--
cited
on
the
legislative
history
which
supports
this
meaning
of
seize
to
do
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
couldn’t
either,
but
i
wonder.
