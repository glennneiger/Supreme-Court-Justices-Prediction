chief

warren
e.
burger
i’m
a
little
puzzled.
perhaps
you
can
clear
it
up.
with
your
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
is
a
pure
question
of
law,
that
the
board,
in
applying
this
statute,
had
to
take
into
account
the
factual
situation
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
the
impact
of
the
secondary
boycott
in
this
whole
situation,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can’
really
isolate
the
statute--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
impact,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
apruzzese.
chief
justice
warren
e.

do
you--
mr.
aronson,
if
you’d
like
to
finish
today,
you
may.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
give
us
as
a
hypothesis
as
to
what
they
were
trying
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
your
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you’re
challenging
the
findings--
the
factual
findings
of
the
board
then,
aren’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that,
on
this
record,
if
that
had
occurred,
it
would
be
an
incidental
effect
which
the
union
had
never
intended?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
your
view,
there
wouldn’t
really
be
a
secondary
boycott.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
such
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
way
of
life
in
the
real
world
of
industrial
relations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
proceeded
just
with
the
quorum
of
two
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
just
one
question.
is
it
your
submission
that
the--
isn’t
a
secondary
boycott
in
operation
lest
it
succeeds
in
bringing
about
a
complete
cessation
of
work?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
is
aimed
at
that,
it
is
enough,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’ve
got
about
four
more
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
one
more
question,
mr.
gold.
do
you
read
judge
prettyman’s
opinion
in
the
retail
clerks
case
as
meaning
that
there
must
be
an
objective
of
complete
cessation
of
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
he
merely
gave
that
as
an
illustration
of
a
pressure
which
would
produce
the
maximum
result
as
against
a
pressure
that
had
no
impact
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
the
line
between
those
two
extremes,
a
disruption
of
business
could
be
a
violation
clearly
under
retail
clerks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
you
have
one
minute
left
if
you--
chief

it.
