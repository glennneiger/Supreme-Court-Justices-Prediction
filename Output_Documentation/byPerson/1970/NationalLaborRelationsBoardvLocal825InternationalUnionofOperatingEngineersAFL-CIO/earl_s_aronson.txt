mr.
earl
s.
aronson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
let
me
say,
initially,
it
is
a
great
honor
for
me
to
appear
before
this
court
with
such
distinguished
adversaries
and
in
such
splendor,
and
it
is
a
day
that
i
shall
treasure
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
with
respect
to
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
both
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
for
the
charging
parties,
there
is
some
agreement
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
union.
there
is
more
disagreement.
with
respect
to
the
basic
facts
which
gave
rise
to
the
instant
dispute,
i
am
in
agreement.
there
is
no
question
there
were
two
work
stoppages
which
the
national
labor
relations
board,
in
its
decision,
found
to
be
illegal.
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
employers
are
neutral
employers
at
the
job
site
involved,
i
am
in
complete
disagreement.
the
national
labor
relations
act
requires,
with
respect
to
section
8
(b)
4
(b),
that
in
addition
to
engaging
in
certain
proscribed
conduct,
that
conduct
be
engaged
in
for
a
certain
specific
objective.
as
it
relates
to
this
case,
that
objective
is
to
force
one
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
another.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
or
in
the
legislative
history
preceding
the
passage
of
the
statute
which
sets
forth
that
congress
desired
to
have
a
sweeping
prohibition
against
all
secondary
activity.
this
court
so
recognizes
this
contention
and
in
the
general
electric
case,
among
others,
it
so
stated
that
the
only
areas
of
prohibition
are
those
areas
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
now,
if
the
board
is
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
can
state
that
in
every
secondary
situation
per
se,
there
must
be
found
an
illegal
seize
doing
business
objective
if
the
form
of
the
coercive
pressure
takes
that
of
a
strike
or
a
work
stoppage.
i
submit
that
the
form
of
the
pressure
is
irrelevant.
it
is
the
objective
that
the
union
desires
which
leads
to
the
ultimate
conclusion,
is
this
activity
to
force
one
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
another?
this
is
a
factual
question,
i
submit
to
the
court,
as
to
whether
a
union
engages
in
conduct
for
a
proscribed
objective.
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
its
decision
reversed
the
trial
examiner
who
held
that
there
was
not
a
saintlier
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
establish
that
the
local
union
involved
designed
to
seize
anyone
to
seize
doing
business
with
anyone
but,
rather,
all
they
wanted
was
that
white
assign
a
certain
man,
member
of
the
local,
to
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
a
welding
machine
or,
further,
that
white
and/or
burns
&
roe
execute
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
nothing
improper,
i
submit,
for
a
union
to
request
or
demand
or
even
strike
to
force
an
employer
to
execute
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
however,
the
board
in
its
decision
sets
forth
no
specific
factual
determination
which
can
support
the
conclusion
that
it
finds,
namely
that
this
conduct
is
to
force
one
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
another.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
the
board?
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
my
client?
my
client
was
seeking
to
have
union
conditions
uniform
throughout
this
job.
white
was
not
complying
with
what,
in
my
client’s
opinion,
were
the
uniform
conditions
on
the
job.
it,
thereafter,
went
to
burns
who
is
the
general
contractor,
who
is
not
a
completely
disinterested
party,
who
in
fact
is
so
interested
that
it
submitted
this
dispute
to
the
national
joint
board.
initially,
it
went
to
burns
to
advise
that
it
was
having
difficulty
with
white,
that
white
was
not
complying
with
the
terms
of
the
union
conditions
in
the
area
and
that
it
wanted
white
to
put
a
man
on
the
welding
machine.
the
general
contractor
was
asked
to
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
is
not
unusual
in
the
building
and
construction
industry,
and
he
refused.
the
union
was
seeking
to
have
burns
&
roe,
the
general
contractor,
exercise
its
influence
over
white
so
that
white
would
put
a
member
of
the
operating
engineers
on
the
welding
machine,
rather
than
an
iron
worker.
this
was
precisely
the
object
that
the
union
sought
in
the
wend
nagle
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
court
there
stated
that
there’s
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
objective.
this
is
not
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
maybe
if
there
are
strikes
and
pressure
it’s
an
illegal
jurisdictional
dispute,
and
i
do
not
argue
that
point
here,
but
it
is
not
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
it
would
have
served
no
purpose
in
this
case
to
have
the
union
or
the
employer
burns,
seize
doing
business
with
white.
the
trial
examiner
so
found,
the
union
didn’t
want
white
off
the
job.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
white
was
never
removed
from
the
job
and
the
two
work
stoppages
involved
a
seize
on
or
about
october
11th
of
the
year
involved.
white
stayed
on
the
job.
there
were
subsequent
jurisdictional
dispute
work
stoppages,
but
that
was
all.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i’m
challenging
them
because
when
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
court
below,
and
i
believe
that
both
counsel
misinterpreted
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
nowhere
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
does
it
state
“there
must
be
a
total
cessation
of
business.”
what
the
court
below
says,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
is
that
if
the
form
of
coercive
activity
takes
that
of
a
work
stoppage,
that
in
it
of
itself,
“without
moore,”
is
insufficient
to
establish
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
the
“without
moore,”
which
the
board
and
counsel
would
ask
be
found
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
the
crucial
fact,
the
fact
which
this
court
found
in
denver
not
by
implication
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
union
said
“we
don’t
want
them
on
the
job.
we
want
to
get
rid
of
his
business”
which
the
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
following
two
cases
which
were
decided
the
same
day
that
denver
was,
the
board
says
“this
is
what
the
union
must
have
wanted.
this
is
the
only
alternative
to
the
primary
employer
exceeding
to
the
union’s
demands.”
that
is
not
so.
that
is
pure
conjecture.
it
very
well
may
be
that
the
general
contractor
will
remove
the
primary
from
the
job
site.
that
might
happen,
but
the
mere
fact
that
it
might
happen
does
not
mean
that
the
union
desired
that
that
would
happen
or
had
the
remotest
wanting
for
that
to
happen.
the
mere
fact
that,
at
times,
there
are
incidental
effects
to
activity
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
that
is
the
desired
effect.
of
course,
the--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
sir.
i
suggest
that
because
that
was
not
the
only
alternative
opened
to
burns
&
roe.
if
the
union,
and
there
are
unions
and
there
are
cases
and
the
board
decisions
are
rife
with
these
cases,
goes
to
the
general
contractor
and
says
to
the
general
“i
want
you
to
utilize
your
influence
upon
the
subcontractor
to
have
him
comply
and,
if
you
can’t
do
it,
i
want
you
to
bounce
him
off
the
job,”
then
we
have
no
difficulty.
we
have
then
the
union
stating
what
its
alternative
objective
and
that
which
it
desires.
but,
in
this
case,
one,
white
did
not
put
a
man
on
the
welding
machine,
two,
he
was
not
removed
from
the
job,
and
three,
the
union
never
asked
that
he’d
be
removed
from
the
job
or
in
fact
is
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
it
desired
he’d
be
removed
from
the
job.
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
examiner
which
the
board
completely
disregards
and
just
substitutes
its
own
finding
as
a
conclusion,
establish
that
the
union
didn’t
want
white
removed
from
the
job
as
it
would’ve
served
absolutely
no
useful
purpose.
again,
in
contradiction
to
the
board’s
argument
of
per
se,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
retail
clerks
case,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief,
also
refused
to
accept
the
board’s
per
se
argument
that
every
time
a
union
engages
in
secondary
activity,
it
must
be
for
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
in
that
case,
the
union
was
seeking
to
force
the
primary
employer
to
recognize
it.
the
statute
prohibits
secondary
activity
for
that
purpose,
and
the
board
contended
to
the
court,
if
the
evidence
establishes
that
the
union
engaged
in
conduct,
secondary,
to
force
the
primary
to
recognize
it,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
must
be
found
that
the
union
engaged
in
the
conduct
also
to
force
the
secondary
to
seize
doing
business
with
the
primary.
the
court
rejected
the
argument.
it
said
it
could
visualize
situations
where
a
union
might
seek
recognition
but
not
a
cessation
of
business.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
a
change
in
business
operations,
such
as
the
imposition
upon
white
of
an
obligation
to
put
an
operating
engineer
on
its
payroll
to
operate
a
welding
machine,
is
the
equivalent
of
a
seize
doing
business
objective
is
an
exaggeration
of
this
statute
beyond
means
and
compare.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
show
that
congress
ever
intended
a
change
in
business
operations
to
be
proscribed.
had
it
so
intended,
it
would’ve
stated
it.
it
only
proscribed
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
there
is
an
important
area
of
disagreement,
and
that
is
the
neutrality
of
the
employers
involved
on
the
particular
job
site.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
union
extended
any
work
stoppages
or
any
threats
beyond
the
confines
of
this
job
site.
the
denver
case
has
been
in
existence
since
approximately
1951.
however,
its
principles
do
not,
in
my
opinion,
conclusively
establish
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
independent
corporations,
independent
contractors
on
a
construction
site,
that
that
alone
means
that
they
are
neutral.
i
believe
that
the
principle
set
forth
by
the
petitioners
has
been
altered
by
this
court
in
the
general
electric
case
and
in
the
carrier
case.
in
those
cases,
although
they
involved
separate
gate
picketing
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
the
principle
remains
the
same
because
if
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
4
has
any
meaning,
it
means
that
it’s
a
primary
strike,
there
are
primary
picketing,
picketing
situation
is
protected.
in
those
cases,
we
had
independent
contractors
at
the
same
job
location
and
this
court
developed
the
normal
operations
test
to
conclude
whether
the
employers
were
in
actuality
neutrals,
secondaries,
and
whether
the
union’s
right
to
extend
its
dispute
to
these
other
employers
was
protected.
the
board
does
not
apply
the
normal
operations
test
to
the
construction
industry.
it
utilizes
a
foreign
test,
that
is,
you’re
an
independent
contractor,
therefore,
you
are
neutral.
it
closes
its
eyes,
i
submit,
to
the
realities
of
the
construction
industry
and,
as
pointed
out
by
this
case,
it
claims
that
burns
was
a
neutral.
burns
had
more
interest
in
this
job
site,
i
submit,
than
any
employer
located
thereon.
he
was
the
general
contractor,
number
one.
number
two,
burns
was
the
one
who
could
have
bound
white
by
executing
a
contract
with
a
legal
subcontractor
clause.
number
three,
it
was
burns
who
submitted
the
dispute
to
national
joint
board.
now,
the
nlrb’s
decision
does
not
go
into
or
discuss
in
any
way
factually
what
the
operations
of
these
employers
were
in
relation
to
each
other
at
the
job
site.
if
it
is
permitted
to
disregard
the
carrier
case
and
the
general
electric
case,
it
will
be
discriminating
against
unions
in
the
construction
industry
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
states
that
unions
or
employers
in
the
construction
industry
are
under
a
different
set
of
rules
than
unions
in
industrial
plants.
there
is
further
support
for
this
type
of
an
argument
concerning
the
non-neutrality
of
employers
on
the
same
construction
site.
in
board
member
fanning’s
decisions,
he,
when
there
is
a
jurisdictional
dispute
and
a
secondary
boycott,
if
you
will,
holds
that
the
finding
of
a
jurisdictional
dispute
precludes
the
finding
of
a
secondary
boycott.
but,
he
also
states
that,
in
jurisdictional
dispute
situations,
it
is
clear
that
the
concept,
primary
and
secondary,
is
unreal.
that,
in
a
jurisdictional
dispute
situation,
a
union
should
have
the
right
to
exert
whatever
pressure
it
has
to
in
support
of
its
jurisdictional
claim
upon
all
of
the
contractors.
because
of
the
interrelationship
he,
in
effect,
applies
the
normal
operations
test
to
the
situation,
as
this
court
did
in
the
carrier
and
general
electric
cases.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
an
argument
that
the
conduct
directed
towards
burns
was
clearly
of
a
primary
nature.
it--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
the
other
subcontractors
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s
true.
burns
had
no
employees
of
its
own.
it
subcontracted
all
of
the
work.
it
is
our
position,
sir,
that--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no,
sir.
there
were
approaches
made
to
burns.
however,
as
well,
burns
was
advised
that
unless
he
did
sign
a
contract
and
unless
white
signed
a
contract
or
put
a
man
on
the
welding
machine,
there
would
be
work
stoppages.
there
were
threats.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
and
white
as
well.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
white
did
employ
operating
engineers
for
a
period
of
time
on
a
crane,
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
was
another
piece
of
equipment
but,
at
the
initial
work
stoppage,
the
october
1st
work
stoppage,
white
had
in
its
employ--
members
of
the
operating
engineers
owned
a
crane.
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
denver
case
is
still
the
law.
however,
there
are
some
facets
of
denver
which
this
court,
i
submit,
has
changed.
to
allow
a
union
in
the
industrial
plant
situation
more
leeway
than
you
do
in
the
construction
industry
is
not
proper.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
stated
in
his
dissent
in
the
denver
case,
if
a
union
has
the
right
to
obtain
certain
working
conditions,
why
then
must
it
be
forced
on
one
job
to
live
with
conditions
other
than
that
which
it
has
with
other
employers.
if
it
extends
its
activity
to
another
job,
i
have
no
difficulty
with
that
situation.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s,
your
honor.
in
the
mark,
will,
&
hart’s
case
it
was
rejected,
with
judge
winston
dissenting.
i
feel
that
the
national
labor
relations
board,
board
member
fanning
at
least,
accepts
the
argument,
and
in
the
mark,
will,
&
hart’s
case,
i
believe
there
were
two
dissenting
opinions
from
the
majority
opinion
accepting
the
argument.
it
is
an
inequity
that
i
feel
should
be
stopped.
i
feel
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
the
expertise
to
set
forth
in
its
decisions
criteria
other
than
the
mere
independent
contractor
test.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
i
cannot
pinpoint
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no.
i
can’t
agree
with
that
also,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no,
there
is
a
secondary
boycott
and
i
can
give
the
court
an
example
of
a
secondary
boycott.
i
thought
i
had.
if
a
union
goes
to
an
employer
and
says
“i
want
you
to
suspend
your
contractual
relationship
with
another
employer,
because
he
won’t
sign
a
contract
with
us,
and
not
to
do
business
with
him”
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
your
honor,
i--
it
is
the
way
of
life.
it
does
happen,
and
it
happens
more
frequently
than
people
could
believe
on
construction
jobs.
the
union
agents
are
not
as
sophisticated
as
attorneys
who
represent
them
or
as
attorneys
who
represent
the
employers
and,
when
they
get
on
a
job
site,
and
the
cases
before
the
nlrb
are
consistent
in
this
regard,
they
indicate
to
the
general
contractor
“we
got
a
problem
with
a
subcontractor
or
we
have
a
problem
with
another
employer,
and
unless
you
get
rid
of
him,
this
job
is
going
to
shut
down.”
now
the
board,
of
course,
can
make
its
ultimate
finding
of
fact
from
facts
other
than
that
which
i
have
just
stated
to
the
court,
and
it
has
done
so.
it
looks
at
the
entire
record
as
a
whole
to
find
out
what
the
true
object
of
the
union
was.
this
is
not
an
easy
area
for
the
board.
the
board
has
had
difficulty
over
the
years
in
finding,
in
many
cases,
what
the
true
objective
was.
however,
it
can
be
done.
i
don’t
say
that’s
the
only
way
it
can
be
done,
but
to
substitute
a
per
se
argument
as
the
board
has
done
here
without
any
basis
in
fact
is
improper.
thank
you.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
your
honor,
i
believe
there
was
a
third
judge
appointed
to
the
panel,
justice
van
duzen,
who
disqualified
himself.
that
is
my
recollection.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s
correct.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
let
me
say,
initially,
it
is
a
great
honor
for
me
to
appear
before
this
court
with
such
distinguished
adversaries
and
in
such
splendor,
and
it
is
a
day
that
i
shall
treasure
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
with
respect
to
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
both
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
for
the
charging
parties,
there
is
some
agreement
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
union.
there
is
more
disagreement.
with
respect
to
the
basic
facts
which
gave
rise
to
the
instant
dispute,
i
am
in
agreement.
there
is
no
question
there
were
two
work
stoppages
which
the
national
labor
relations
board,
in
its
decision,
found
to
be
illegal.
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
employers
are
neutral
employers
at
the
job
site
involved,
i
am
in
complete
disagreement.
the
national
labor
relations
act
requires,
with
respect
to
section
8
(b)
4
(b),
that
in
addition
to
engaging
in
certain
proscribed
conduct,
that
conduct
be
engaged
in
for
a
certain
specific
objective.
as
it
relates
to
this
case,
that
objective
is
to
force
one
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
another.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
or
in
the
legislative
history
preceding
the
passage
of
the
statute
which
sets
forth
that
congress
desired
to
have
a
sweeping
prohibition
against
all
secondary
activity.
this
court
so
recognizes
this
contention
and
in
the
general
electric
case,
among
others,
it
so
stated
that
the
only
areas
of
prohibition
are
those
areas
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
now,
if
the
board
is
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
can
state
that
in
every
secondary
situation
per
se,
there
must
be
found
an
illegal
seize
doing
business
objective
if
the
form
of
the
coercive
pressure
takes
that
of
a
strike
or
a
work
stoppage.
i
submit
that
the
form
of
the
pressure
is
irrelevant.
it
is
the
objective
that
the
union
desires
which
leads
to
the
ultimate
conclusion,
is
this
activity
to
force
one
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
another?
this
is
a
factual
question,
i
submit
to
the
court,
as
to
whether
a
union
engages
in
conduct
for
a
proscribed
objective.
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
its
decision
reversed
the
trial
examiner
who
held
that
there
was
not
a
saintlier
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
establish
that
the
local
union
involved
designed
to
seize
anyone
to
seize
doing
business
with
anyone
but,
rather,
all
they
wanted
was
that
white
assign
a
certain
man,
member
of
the
local,
to
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
a
welding
machine
or,
further,
that
white
and/or
burns
&
roe
execute
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
nothing
improper,
i
submit,
for
a
union
to
request
or
demand
or
even
strike
to
force
an
employer
to
execute
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
however,
the
board
in
its
decision
sets
forth
no
specific
factual
determination
which
can
support
the
conclusion
that
it
finds,
namely
that
this
conduct
is
to
force
one
employer
to
seize
doing
business
with
another.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
the
board?
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
my
client?
my
client
was
seeking
to
have
union
conditions
uniform
throughout
this
job.
white
was
not
complying
with
what,
in
my
client’s
opinion,
were
the
uniform
conditions
on
the
job.
it,
thereafter,
went
to
burns
who
is
the
general
contractor,
who
is
not
a
completely
disinterested
party,
who
in
fact
is
so
interested
that
it
submitted
this
dispute
to
the
national
joint
board.
initially,
it
went
to
burns
to
advise
that
it
was
having
difficulty
with
white,
that
white
was
not
complying
with
the
terms
of
the
union
conditions
in
the
area
and
that
it
wanted
white
to
put
a
man
on
the
welding
machine.
the
general
contractor
was
asked
to
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
is
not
unusual
in
the
building
and
construction
industry,
and
he
refused.
the
union
was
seeking
to
have
burns
&
roe,
the
general
contractor,
exercise
its
influence
over
white
so
that
white
would
put
a
member
of
the
operating
engineers
on
the
welding
machine,
rather
than
an
iron
worker.
this
was
precisely
the
object
that
the
union
sought
in
the
wend
nagle
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
court
there
stated
that
there’s
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
objective.
this
is
not
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
maybe
if
there
are
strikes
and
pressure
it’s
an
illegal
jurisdictional
dispute,
and
i
do
not
argue
that
point
here,
but
it
is
not
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
it
would
have
served
no
purpose
in
this
case
to
have
the
union
or
the
employer
burns,
seize
doing
business
with
white.
the
trial
examiner
so
found,
the
union
didn’t
want
white
off
the
job.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
white
was
never
removed
from
the
job
and
the
two
work
stoppages
involved
a
seize
on
or
about
october
11th
of
the
year
involved.
white
stayed
on
the
job.
there
were
subsequent
jurisdictional
dispute
work
stoppages,
but
that
was
all.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i’m
challenging
them
because
when
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
court
below,
and
i
believe
that
both
counsel
misinterpreted
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
nowhere
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
does
it
state
“there
must
be
a
total
cessation
of
business.”
what
the
court
below
says,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
is
that
if
the
form
of
coercive
activity
takes
that
of
a
work
stoppage,
that
in
it
of
itself,
“without
moore,”
is
insufficient
to
establish
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
the
“without
moore,”
which
the
board
and
counsel
would
ask
be
found
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
the
crucial
fact,
the
fact
which
this
court
found
in
denver
not
by
implication
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
union
said
“we
don’t
want
them
on
the
job.
we
want
to
get
rid
of
his
business”
which
the
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
following
two
cases
which
were
decided
the
same
day
that
denver
was,
the
board
says
“this
is
what
the
union
must
have
wanted.
this
is
the
only
alternative
to
the
primary
employer
exceeding
to
the
union’s
demands.”
that
is
not
so.
that
is
pure
conjecture.
it
very
well
may
be
that
the
general
contractor
will
remove
the
primary
from
the
job
site.
that
might
happen,
but
the
mere
fact
that
it
might
happen
does
not
mean
that
the
union
desired
that
that
would
happen
or
had
the
remotest
wanting
for
that
to
happen.
the
mere
fact
that,
at
times,
there
are
incidental
effects
to
activity
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
that
is
the
desired
effect.
of
course,
the--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
sir.
i
suggest
that
because
that
was
not
the
only
alternative
opened
to
burns
&
roe.
if
the
union,
and
there
are
unions
and
there
are
cases
and
the
board
decisions
are
rife
with
these
cases,
goes
to
the
general
contractor
and
says
to
the
general
“i
want
you
to
utilize
your
influence
upon
the
subcontractor
to
have
him
comply
and,
if
you
can’t
do
it,
i
want
you
to
bounce
him
off
the
job,”
then
we
have
no
difficulty.
we
have
then
the
union
stating
what
its
alternative
objective
and
that
which
it
desires.
but,
in
this
case,
one,
white
did
not
put
a
man
on
the
welding
machine,
two,
he
was
not
removed
from
the
job,
and
three,
the
union
never
asked
that
he’d
be
removed
from
the
job
or
in
fact
is
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
it
desired
he’d
be
removed
from
the
job.
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
examiner
which
the
board
completely
disregards
and
just
substitutes
its
own
finding
as
a
conclusion,
establish
that
the
union
didn’t
want
white
removed
from
the
job
as
it
would’ve
served
absolutely
no
useful
purpose.
again,
in
contradiction
to
the
board’s
argument
of
per
se,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
retail
clerks
case,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief,
also
refused
to
accept
the
board’s
per
se
argument
that
every
time
a
union
engages
in
secondary
activity,
it
must
be
for
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
in
that
case,
the
union
was
seeking
to
force
the
primary
employer
to
recognize
it.
the
statute
prohibits
secondary
activity
for
that
purpose,
and
the
board
contended
to
the
court,
if
the
evidence
establishes
that
the
union
engaged
in
conduct,
secondary,
to
force
the
primary
to
recognize
it,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
must
be
found
that
the
union
engaged
in
the
conduct
also
to
force
the
secondary
to
seize
doing
business
with
the
primary.
the
court
rejected
the
argument.
it
said
it
could
visualize
situations
where
a
union
might
seek
recognition
but
not
a
cessation
of
business.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
a
change
in
business
operations,
such
as
the
imposition
upon
white
of
an
obligation
to
put
an
operating
engineer
on
its
payroll
to
operate
a
welding
machine,
is
the
equivalent
of
a
seize
doing
business
objective
is
an
exaggeration
of
this
statute
beyond
means
and
compare.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
show
that
congress
ever
intended
a
change
in
business
operations
to
be
proscribed.
had
it
so
intended,
it
would’ve
stated
it.
it
only
proscribed
a
seize
doing
business
objective.
there
is
an
important
area
of
disagreement,
and
that
is
the
neutrality
of
the
employers
involved
on
the
particular
job
site.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
union
extended
any
work
stoppages
or
any
threats
beyond
the
confines
of
this
job
site.
the
denver
case
has
been
in
existence
since
approximately
1951.
however,
its
principles
do
not,
in
my
opinion,
conclusively
establish
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
independent
corporations,
independent
contractors
on
a
construction
site,
that
that
alone
means
that
they
are
neutral.
i
believe
that
the
principle
set
forth
by
the
petitioners
has
been
altered
by
this
court
in
the
general
electric
case
and
in
the
carrier
case.
in
those
cases,
although
they
involved
separate
gate
picketing
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
the
principle
remains
the
same
because
if
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
4
has
any
meaning,
it
means
that
it’s
a
primary
strike,
there
are
primary
picketing,
picketing
situation
is
protected.
in
those
cases,
we
had
independent
contractors
at
the
same
job
location
and
this
court
developed
the
normal
operations
test
to
conclude
whether
the
employers
were
in
actuality
neutrals,
secondaries,
and
whether
the
union’s
right
to
extend
its
dispute
to
these
other
employers
was
protected.
the
board
does
not
apply
the
normal
operations
test
to
the
construction
industry.
it
utilizes
a
foreign
test,
that
is,
you’re
an
independent
contractor,
therefore,
you
are
neutral.
it
closes
its
eyes,
i
submit,
to
the
realities
of
the
construction
industry
and,
as
pointed
out
by
this
case,
it
claims
that
burns
was
a
neutral.
burns
had
more
interest
in
this
job
site,
i
submit,
than
any
employer
located
thereon.
he
was
the
general
contractor,
number
one.
number
two,
burns
was
the
one
who
could
have
bound
white
by
executing
a
contract
with
a
legal
subcontractor
clause.
number
three,
it
was
burns
who
submitted
the
dispute
to
national
joint
board.
now,
the
nlrb’s
decision
does
not
go
into
or
discuss
in
any
way
factually
what
the
operations
of
these
employers
were
in
relation
to
each
other
at
the
job
site.
if
it
is
permitted
to
disregard
the
carrier
case
and
the
general
electric
case,
it
will
be
discriminating
against
unions
in
the
construction
industry
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
states
that
unions
or
employers
in
the
construction
industry
are
under
a
different
set
of
rules
than
unions
in
industrial
plants.
there
is
further
support
for
this
type
of
an
argument
concerning
the
non-neutrality
of
employers
on
the
same
construction
site.
in
board
member
fanning’s
decisions,
he,
when
there
is
a
jurisdictional
dispute
and
a
secondary
boycott,
if
you
will,
holds
that
the
finding
of
a
jurisdictional
dispute
precludes
the
finding
of
a
secondary
boycott.
but,
he
also
states
that,
in
jurisdictional
dispute
situations,
it
is
clear
that
the
concept,
primary
and
secondary,
is
unreal.
that,
in
a
jurisdictional
dispute
situation,
a
union
should
have
the
right
to
exert
whatever
pressure
it
has
to
in
support
of
its
jurisdictional
claim
upon
all
of
the
contractors.
because
of
the
interrelationship
he,
in
effect,
applies
the
normal
operations
test
to
the
situation,
as
this
court
did
in
the
carrier
and
general
electric
cases.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
an
argument
that
the
conduct
directed
towards
burns
was
clearly
of
a
primary
nature.
it--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
the
other
subcontractors
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s
true.
burns
had
no
employees
of
its
own.
it
subcontracted
all
of
the
work.
it
is
our
position,
sir,
that--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no,
sir.
there
were
approaches
made
to
burns.
however,
as
well,
burns
was
advised
that
unless
he
did
sign
a
contract
and
unless
white
signed
a
contract
or
put
a
man
on
the
welding
machine,
there
would
be
work
stoppages.
there
were
threats.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
and
white
as
well.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
yes,
white
did
employ
operating
engineers
for
a
period
of
time
on
a
crane,
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
was
another
piece
of
equipment
but,
at
the
initial
work
stoppage,
the
october
1st
work
stoppage,
white
had
in
its
employ--
members
of
the
operating
engineers
owned
a
crane.
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
denver
case
is
still
the
law.
however,
there
are
some
facets
of
denver
which
this
court,
i
submit,
has
changed.
to
allow
a
union
in
the
industrial
plant
situation
more
leeway
than
you
do
in
the
construction
industry
is
not
proper.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
stated
in
his
dissent
in
the
denver
case,
if
a
union
has
the
right
to
obtain
certain
working
conditions,
why
then
must
it
be
forced
on
one
job
to
live
with
conditions
other
than
that
which
it
has
with
other
employers.
if
it
extends
its
activity
to
another
job,
i
have
no
difficulty
with
that
situation.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s,
your
honor.
in
the
mark,
will,
&
hart’s
case
it
was
rejected,
with
judge
winston
dissenting.
i
feel
that
the
national
labor
relations
board,
board
member
fanning
at
least,
accepts
the
argument,
and
in
the
mark,
will,
&
hart’s
case,
i
believe
there
were
two
dissenting
opinions
from
the
majority
opinion
accepting
the
argument.
it
is
an
inequity
that
i
feel
should
be
stopped.
i
feel
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
the
expertise
to
set
forth
in
its
decisions
criteria
other
than
the
mere
independent
contractor
test.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
i
cannot
pinpoint
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which--
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no.
i
can’t
agree
with
that
also,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
no,
there
is
a
secondary
boycott
and
i
can
give
the
court
an
example
of
a
secondary
boycott.
i
thought
i
had.
if
a
union
goes
to
an
employer
and
says
“i
want
you
to
suspend
your
contractual
relationship
with
another
employer,
because
he
won’t
sign
a
contract
with
us,
and
not
to
do
business
with
him”
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
your
honor,
i--
it
is
the
way
of
life.
it
does
happen,
and
it
happens
more
frequently
than
people
could
believe
on
construction
jobs.
the
union
agents
are
not
as
sophisticated
as
attorneys
who
represent
them
or
as
attorneys
who
represent
the
employers
and,
when
they
get
on
a
job
site,
and
the
cases
before
the
nlrb
are
consistent
in
this
regard,
they
indicate
to
the
general
contractor
“we
got
a
problem
with
a
subcontractor
or
we
have
a
problem
with
another
employer,
and
unless
you
get
rid
of
him,
this
job
is
going
to
shut
down.”
now
the
board,
of
course,
can
make
its
ultimate
finding
of
fact
from
facts
other
than
that
which
i
have
just
stated
to
the
court,
and
it
has
done
so.
it
looks
at
the
entire
record
as
a
whole
to
find
out
what
the
true
object
of
the
union
was.
this
is
not
an
easy
area
for
the
board.
the
board
has
had
difficulty
over
the
years
in
finding,
in
many
cases,
what
the
true
objective
was.
however,
it
can
be
done.
i
don’t
say
that’s
the
only
way
it
can
be
done,
but
to
substitute
a
per
se
argument
as
the
board
has
done
here
without
any
basis
in
fact
is
improper.
thank
you.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
your
honor,
i
believe
there
was
a
third
judge
appointed
to
the
panel,
justice
van
duzen,
who
disqualified
himself.
that
is
my
recollection.
mr.
earl
s.
aronson
that’s
correct.
