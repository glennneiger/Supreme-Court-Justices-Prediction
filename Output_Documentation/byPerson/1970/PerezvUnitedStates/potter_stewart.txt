justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
conceded
that
run
of
the
mill
extortion
was
exercised.
and
threat
remained
--
i
take
it
from
your
statement
just
now
this
is
conceded.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
krieger,
you
repeated
several
times
as
i
have
understood
you
at
least
that
you
think
that
congress
would
have
constitutional
power
to
enact
the
criminal
statute
in
this
area
and
even
to
make
the
particular
conduct
involved
in
this
case,
a
federal
crime.
did
i
understand
you
correctly
but
i
know
that
you
said
that
this
statute
is
far
too
broad
in
scope?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
what
power
of
congress,
under
what
constitutional
provision?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
under
the
commerce
power,
congress
would
have
the
power
to
make
this
conduct
a
criminal
--
a
federal
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
now
proved
what
--
each
individual
a
criminal
prosecution
or
proved
in
congressional
hearings?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
that
if
congress
enacted
a
statute
saying
it’s
a
criminal
offense
to
be
engaged
in
a
business
of
loan
sharking
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
statute,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
then
where,
in
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
--
approved
in
the
particular
congressional
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
would
this
additional
embroidery
be?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
you
haven’t
agreed
that
at
least
under
existing
constitutional
law
that
congress
couldn’t
make
a
local
larceny
of
a
federal
criminal
offense
but
is
it
abjure
to
what
you
concede
that
if
a
person
were
in
the
business
of
being
of
grand
larceny
that
congress
could
do
so,
if
he
just
got
up
everyday
and
would
do
his
job
of
stealing
that
that
could
be
a
federal
offense
just
because
he
was
in
the
business
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
understand
your
point
at
all
really.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
not
just
as
organized,
it
has
to
--
there
has
to
be
findings
or
evidence
that
it’s
a
national
or
at
least
an
interstate
organization,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
or
an
international
organization.
it’s
got
to
be
more
than
just
organized
and
that
has
to
be
broader
than
merely
statewide
in
scope.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that’s
what
made
me
wonder
why
you
conceded
that
this
conduct
of
your
client
which
you
emphasized
to
us
earlier
was
all
within
the
city
of
brooklyn,
new
york.
why
you
conceded
as
i
--
you
tell
me
you
did
and
i
didn’t
misunderstand
that
it
could
have
been
made
a
federal
criminal
offense
by
a
properly
drawn
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor
general,
to
what
is
that
reference
in
the
last
sentence
of
section
2
of
the
findings
of
page
2
of
the
exclusionary
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
subsection
2
of
the
findings
of
page
2
of
your
brief.
the
last
sentence
makes
a
reference
to
factors
which
have
rendered
past
efforts
of
persecution
on
most
wholly
uneffected
has
been
the
existence
of
exclusionary
rules
of
evidence
stricter
than
necessary
for
the
protection
of
--[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
well
except
that
i
gather
he
concedes
that
his
conduct
by
any
definition,
constitute
extortion.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
perhaps
the
petitioner
could
straighten
this
out
later
but
i
haven’t
understood
that
any
such
concession
was
made,
i’d
understood
that
the
claim
in
this
case
is
that
this
statute
was
beyond
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
enact.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
then
he
would
probably
also
have
federal
income
tax
because
that
really
doesn’t
have
much
to
do
with
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
if
in
these
findings
that
are
reproduced
here
on
pages
two
and
three
of
your
brief,
congress
has
found
that
extortionate
credit
transactions,
every
place
where
we
now
read
extortionate
credit
transactions,
what
if
congress
had
found
this
about
grand
larceny
so
that
for
example,
a
fining
had
been
a
substantial
part
of
the
income
of
organized
crime
as
generated
by
grand
larceny
and
then
the
description
of
grand
larceny
works
and
grand
larceny
directly
impairs
the
effectiveness
and
frustrates
the
purpose
of
the
laws
enacted
and
is
subject
to
bankruptcies
also.
every
place
just
grand
larceny
and
then
congress
had
proceeded
to
say
that
whoever
commits
grand
larceny
or
conspires
to
do
so
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000.00
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
20
years
or
both.
would
that
have
been
a
constitutional
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
would
it
be
more
difficult
than
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
much
have
stolen
every
year
in
grand
larceny?
justice
potter
stewart
and
my
guess
would
be
that
considering
more
stolen
every
year
and
it
is
extortionate
credit
transactions
without
knowing
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
conceded
that
run
of
the
mill
extortion
was
exercised.
