mr.
albert
j.
krieger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
considering
the
constitutionality
of
title
ii
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
what
has
been
popularly
called
the
federal
anti-loan
sharking
statute.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
real
question
posed
is
whether
congress
may
constitutionally
enact
a
general
extortion
statute
because
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
does
not
reach
in
the
true
sense
the
crime
of
loan
sharking.
loan
sharking,
if
we
follow
the
definition
of
that
crime
as
testified
to
at
the
hearings
before
congress
is
a
lending
at
a
usurious
rate
of
interest.
this
statute
does
not
include
anywhere
within
it.
those
activities
as
a
criminal
offense.
that
which
it
makes
criminal
is
extortion
and
extortion
of
the
broadest
tribe
covering
the
myriad
extortionate
activities
to
which
criminals
may
resort
in
our
varied
society.
even
though,
the
statute
continually
refers
to
the
term,
the
phrase,
extension
of
credit,
extension
of
credit
as
defined
by
the
statute
refers
not
only
to
a
debt
but
to
a
claim,
be
that
claim
valid
or
invalid,
acknowledged
or
not,
disputed
or
not,
however
arising,
so
long
as
the
satisfaction
of
that
claim
is
deferred.
the
hearings
before
congress
certainly
disclosed
and
it
may
well
be
assumed
that
organized
crime
is
intestate
in
character
and
that
organized
crime
may
have
as
one
of
its
substantial
sources
of
revenue,
loan
sharking,
that
is
the
lending
of
money
at
usurious
rates
of
interest.
but
there
is
nothing
within
the
proceedings
had
before
congress
which
would
warrant
the
broad
and
sweeping
finding
that
extortion
per
se
is
a
crime
which
belongs
in
a
federal
lexicon.
the
types
of
extortion
covered
here
may
well
include
the
incidental
extortion
to
which
a
loan
shark
may
resort
in
seeking
collection
of
a
debt,
of
a
lending.
it
may
also
include
an
irate
wage
earner
going
to
his
employer
and
demanding
wages.
it
may
include
an
irate
motorist
after
a
collision
saying
to
another
driver,
“you
will
pay
me
for
this
damage,
one
way
or
the
other
and
by
the
end
of
the
week.”
these
are
all
included
within
what
we
contend
as
any
reasonable
reading
of
the
definition
extension
of
credit.
certainly,
and
we
concede,
there
are
times
when
extortionate
means
are
employed
by
loan
sharks
but
what
congress
has
done
here
is
because
organized
crime
may
be
well
involved
in
loan
sharking
and
loan
sharking
at
some
time
may
involve
extortion,
then
all
extortion
regardless
of
how
it
arises
becomes
a
federal
offense.
we
respectfully
submit
that
such
a
statute
is
a
classic
case
of
overkill.
certainly,
congress
may
legislate
against
the
crime
of
extortion.
congress
has
done
so
in
1951,
1952,
the
travel
act.
congress
may
broaden
what
it
includes
as
a
federal
offense
in
extortion,
so
long
as
that
extortion
may
reasonably
be
connected
with
a
federal
interest.
the
federal
interest
however,
between
extortion
generally,
extortion
generally
appears
to
be
lacking.
the
federal
interest
connection
to
extortion
generally
appears
to
be
lacking.
certainly,
it
did
not
appear
within
the
hearings.
the
hearings
were
directed
at
a
specific
definable
class
of
activity.
congress,
in
seeking
to
legislate
against
an
organized
crime
activity
enacted
the
statute
and
congress
stated
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
strike
at
the
second
most
lucrative
source
of
revenue
for
organized
crime
loan
sharking.
there
is
nothing
within
the
proceedings
before
congress
which
characterized
extortion
as
a
uniquely
organized
crime
activity
or
that
extortion
per
se
is
a
lucrative
source
of
funds
for
organized
crime.
the
federal
pay
for
the
general
extortion
statute
is
lacking.
there
is
no
definable
class
of
activity
or
activities
whose
very
nature
might
compel
the
finding
of
the
federal
interest,
all
of
the
current
gambling
statute,
where
congress
instead
of
making
all
gambling
illegal
said
gambling
of
a
certain
type
has
characteristics
which
compel
the
finding
of
the
federal
interest
such
as
it
must
involve
--
the
gambling
activity
must
involve
five
or
more
people
deal
in
an
amount
in
excess
of
$2,000.00
on
a
daily
rate
or
be
an
activity
which
is
continued
for
30
days
or
more
and
that
the
gambling
activity
be
the
business
of
the
individuals.
here,
any,
if
i
may
say
occasional
extortioner,
finds
himself
fully
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
even
if
his
activity
is
totally
unrelated
to
loan
sharking,
the
vice
which
congress
was
seeking
to
control.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
means
that
congress
has
selected
to
control
loan
sharking,
these
means
are
far
too
broad,
far
too
inclusive
and
exceeds
the
authority
of
congress
both
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
under
the
bankruptcy
clause.
we
believe
and
we
do
not
argue
here
that
every
specific
criminal
statute
requires
a
recitation
that
there
must
be
proved
to
a
jury,
an
interstate
activity
or
that
an
interstate
facility
was
used.
we
do
believe
however,
that
in
a
criminal
statute
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
trial
level
if
not
of
the
interstate
activity
itself
or
the
use
of
the
interstate
facility
but
such
a
state
of
facts
as
warrant
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
interest
is
involved.
the
current--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan
are
that
in
a
local
butcher’s
store
in
brooklyn,
mr.
miranda
was
the
owner
of
the
local
butcher’s
store
in
brooklyn,
that
he
needed
some
revenue.
he
was
not
able
to
obtain
monies
through
the
usual
sources
and
through
a
friend
was
introduced
to
a
petitioner.
the
petitioner
loaned
him
some
money
at
a
usurious
rate
of
interest.
eventually
the
--
mr.
miranda
was
unable
to
repay,
a
new
loans
worked
out,
again
at
usurious
rate
of
interest.
mr.
miranda
was
again
unable
to
repay
and
finally
extortionate
threats
were
made
to
mr.
miranda
to
attempt
to
effect
repayment.
there
were
no
interstate
facilities
used.
this
all
involved
a
transaction
occurring
in
brooklyn,
new
york
in
the
williamsburg
section.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
oh,
yes
your
honor.
there
was
extortion
under
the
proof
in
this
case,
there
was.
but
we
feel
that
the
fact
of
extortion
in
this
case
still
does
not
make
the
extortion
as
committed
by
the
defendant
here
a
federal
offense.
the
only
way
this
extortion
could
become
a
federal
offense
is
if
a
general
extortion
statute
were
part
of
a
federal
criminal
code
and
that
is
basically
what
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
is.
if
the
intent
of
congress
were
carried
out,
it
is
perhaps
quite
possible
that
mr.
perez’s
activities
would
fall
within
a
loan
sharking
definition
that
would
be
constitutionally
acceptable
but
we
are
dealing
not
with
such
a
statute.
i
repeat
we’re
dealing
with
a
general
extortion
statute
and
regardless
of
the
constant
reference
to
this
statute
as
a
loan
sharking
statute.
a
loan
sharking
statute,
its
basic
nature
is
not
changed.
the
congress
in
the
proposed
new
federal
criminal
code
treated
the
loan
sharking
statute
anew,
and
here
they
faced
up
to
the
problem
because
there
was
a
recognition
in
the
commentary
that
such
jurisdiction
referring
to
this
plenary
jurisdiction
over
extortionate
activity
may
well
be
over
broad
and
they
recognized
also
apparently
that
the
statute
--
the
current
statute
was
an
extortion
statute
and
they
rewrote.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
would
say
that
the
constitutional
difference
sir,
is
that
this
statute
just
generally
with
an
enormous
vacuum
cleaner
type
of
facts
sweeps
in
every
type
of
extortionate
activity
be
at
intrastate,
be
at
interstate,
be
it
connected
with
federal
interest,
be
it
not
connected
with
the
federal
interest.
a
loan
sharking
statute
such
as
the
one
that
appears
in
section
1771
of
the
proposed
code
defines
a
class
of
activity,
thereby
limiting
the
scope
of
the
statute.
it
legislates
against
loan
sharking
as
a
business.
it
implants
definitions
of
the
business,
the
character
of
the
business
and
the
nature
of
the
business
connects
it
with
organized
crime
activity,
so
that
the
casual
lender
just
as
the
casual
gambler
is
omitted
from
the
impact
of
federal
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
we
are
basically
dealing
sir,
with
matters
of
definition.
how
far
out
may
congress
reach
in
legislating
against
what
might
well
be
an
interstate
evil?
this
is
basically,
i
submit,
a
matter
of
scope.
it
is
true
that
extortion
within
the
loan
shark
gambit
may
be
reached
but
may
extortion
unrelated
to
the
loan
sharking
activity
be
reached
also.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
hearing
before
congress
so
state.
they
say
that
the
only
time
that
extortion
arises
is
when
there
is
a
failure
to
pay
that
loan
sharking
it’s
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
a
usurious
rate
of
interest.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
he
cannot
rely
of
course
upon
the
court
and
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
if
the
man
says
i
just
won’t
pay,
i
would
assume
that
the
loan
shark
would
then
have
to
resort
to
an
extortionate
pattern
of
conduct.
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
other
way.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
sir.
it
would
be
a
peculiarly
--
it
would
be
a
peculiar
part
of
loan
sharking
in
respect
of
that
part
of
loan
sharking
which
is
based
upon
a
failure
to
pay.
now,
we
certainly
are
well
aware
of
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
that’s
a
perfect
defense
to
the
loan,
if
the
loan
shark
would
so,
the
usurious
rate
of
interest
would
render
in
the
nature
of
a
defense,
the
loan
void
and
unenforceable
in
the
court,
yes.
but
we
also
have
the
situation
where
people
who
deal
with
loan
sharks
deal
to
a
great
extent
in
a
manner
of
trust
the
same
as
in
the
gambling
business
where
these
sort
of
obligations
apparently
are
honored.
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
an
extortioner
to
be
a
loan
shark.
and
i
think
that
the
hearing
in
it
bare
that
out.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
such
was
the
testimony,
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
are
many,
many
people
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
the
congressional
hearings,
that
there
are
many,
many
people
who
are
unable
to
resort
to
a
normal
avenues
of
commerce
in
order
to
obtain
loans
or
financing
and
the
specific
statement
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
mr.
medzker,
an
assistant
district
attorney
in
the
rocket
section
or
district
attorney
hogan’s
office
in
new
york
county
was
that
most
loan
sharking
transactions
are
amicable
transactions
in
their
commencement
and
in
their
conclusion.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
it
does
occur
sir.
it
does
occur,
mr.
chief
justice
but
it
isn’t
an
inherent
part
of
the
beast,
that
most
loan
sharking
transactions
according
to
what
we
find
from
the
congressional
hearings
and
amicably.
there
are
those
where
there
is
the
resort
to
extortion.
we
do
not
question
that
but
query
does
the
resort
to
extortion
in
'x'
percentage
of
loan
sharking
transactions
warrant
the
enactment
of
an
extortion’s
statute
which
reaches
all
and
every
type
of
extortion
to
which
the
human
mind
can
imagine
in
this
country,
and
make
that
a
federal
crime.
that,
i
think
is
the
basic
defect
in
the
statute.
certainly,
if
a
certain
type
of
extortionate
behavior
could
be
reasonably
be
defined
as
present
in
organized
crime
loan
sharking,
i
think
congress
could
legislate
against
that.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
originally,
it
was
$1,000.00.
it
went
up
to
$3,000.00
finally.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
oh,
i
would
estimate
well
and
excess
of
45%
which
is
mentioned
in
the
statute.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
it
was
payable
on
weekly
terms.
i
think
the
original
loan
was
a
thousand
dollars
payable
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
and
some
odd
dollars,
$105.00
a
week
for
14
weeks.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
when
mr.
miranda’s
business
proved
to
be
unsuccessful
and
he
was
unable
to
meet
the
payments.
the
petitioner
allegedly
went
to
mr.
miranda
and
told
him
that
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes,
sir
told
him
that
somebody
else
had
borrowed
from
them
and
had
and
paid
and
then
wound
up
in
the
hospital.
the
extortionate
character
of
the
statements
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no
one
was
hurt
if
that
is
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
he
wasn’t
successful.
i
think
one
payment
was
made
after
the
threat.
the
entire
debt
was
never
repaid.
the
defendant
was
arrested,
some
months
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
extortion
was
a
threat
of
bodily
injury
in
the
event
of
failure
to
pay
what
was
due
and
owing.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no.
no,
he
had
made
reference
to
other
people
to
another
person
who
had
gone
to
the
hospital.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
three
times.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
basically,
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
there
was
no
prosecution
brought
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
miranda
first
turned
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
the
city
police
and
i
am
unaware
as
to
what
happened
when
he
made
a
complaint
to
the
city
police
but
he
then
complained
to
the
fbi
and
then
about
a
month
after
he
complained
to
the
fbi.
the
petitioner
was
arrested.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
i
did
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
basically,
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
as
far
as
the
bankruptcy
clause
is
concerned
i
don’t
think
that
i
could
add
anything
to
what
judge
hay
said
in
the
dissent
in
this
case.
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
broad
reach
and
a
large
step
from
uniform
laws
on
bankruptcy
to
a
statute
such
as
this
dealing
with
extortion
generally.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
provided
that
the
loan
sharking
–
the
underlying
loan
sharking
was
connected
in
some
manner
with
a
federal
interest.
that
federal
interest
may
come
about
through
the
use
of
federal
facilities,
interstate
facilities
or
if
the
loan
sharking
activity
was
the
type
of
business,
was
proved
to
be
the
type
of
business
whereby
the
loan
sharking
would
be
thought
of
what
we
might
call
the
organized
crime
complex.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
it
should
be
proved
in
the
manner
in
which
suggested
in
the
proposed
code
where
they
say
there
should
be
proof
that
the
man
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
loan
sharking.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
loan
sharking
with
a
few
added
provisions
in
there
as
well.
i
don’t
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
the
statute
itself
which
of
course
would
be
part
of
the
proof
that
would
be
required
at
the
trial.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
as
the
sense
of
the
statute,
the
sense
of
the
hearings
is
to
attack
organized
crime.
there
should
be
requirement
that
there
is
an
organized
criminal
element
in
the
loan
sharking
transaction
against
which
the
prosecution
has
leveled.
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
gambling
statute,
they
seek
a
criminal
organization
in
order
to
bring
that
gambling
within
the
federal
gambit.
if
a
man
is
individually
a
loan
shark,
then
there
is
nothing
within
the
congressional
hearings
which
would
support
the
finding
that
he
has
an
impact
upon
interstate
commerce.
if
he
is
in
the
business
of
loan
sharking
and
he
utilizes
other
people,
then
he
may
well
be
engaged
in
an
organized
criminal
activity.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
if
he
is
in
an
organized
criminal
activity
and
congress
through
the
hearings
has
established
organized
criminal
activity
as
effecting
interstate
commerce,
it
may
well
be
that
under
the
wickard
against
filburn
rule,
he
may
find
himself
brought
in
within
the
gambit.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
do
not
contend
that
the
impact
on
interstate
commerce
has
to
be
proved
at
the
trial.
if
the
definition
of
a
criminal
activity
includes
within
it
such
provable
facts,
such
provable
facts
at
a
trial
level
as
of
necessity
linked
to
the
criminal
activity
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i’m
trying
to
equate
the
supposition
that
your
honor,
poses
with
the
federal
gambling
statute.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
but
they
used
certain
standards
sir
in
there
which
i
think
make
that
statute
not
necessarily
constitutionally
objectionable
as
opposed
to
this
statute.
they
say
their
man
should
be
in
the
business
of
gambling,
or
instance,
a
man
would
have
to
be
in
the
business
of
larceny
that
his
activity
by
definition
would
be
connected
with
organized
criminal
activity
which
has
been
established
before
congress
to
be
in
the
business
of
grand
larceny
of
the
type
and
nature
of
which
this
man
stands
accused
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well,
if
three
people
just
go
about
the
business
of
stealing,
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
federal
offense
nor
does
it
have
an
impact
upon
a
federal
interest.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
believe
so.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
did
not
intend
to
so
concede.
well,
then
i
made
a
mistake.
i
meant
to
surround
that
statement
with
other
things
such
as
organized
criminal
activity
of
a
nature
which
congress
has
found
to
be
part
of
organized
crime
which
congress
has
also
found
to
be
interstate
in
character
and
nature.
i
have
nothing
further
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
correct
one
impression
and
that
is
this
apparent
concession
of
mine
that
the
activities
of
mr.
perez
would
be
subject
to
a
federal
proscription.
i
do
not
intend
such
concession
and
i’m
intended
to
say
that
perhaps
congress
can
enact
the
statute
which
upon
the
addition
of
other
fact
that
is
not
present
in
this
case
could
reach
specific
loan
sharking.
the
case
as
it
has
come
here
affecting
the
specific
type
of
transaction
in
which
mr.
perez
engaged,
i
think
is
beyond
the
reach
of
congress.
it
cannot
be
the
subject
of
a
congressional
enactment.
i
think
that
all
necessary
points
have
been
covered
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well
i
think
that
that
would
cover
a
host
of
--
that
the
same
reasoning
could
be
applied
to
a
host
of
other
activities
to
pick
up
the
instance
which
mr.
justice
stewart
gave
in
regard
to
larceny.
certainly,
any
crime
which
affects
the
economic
stability
of
a
business
then
would
be
subject
to
federal
legislation.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well,
certainly
if
a
warehouse
of
amp
was
broken
into
and
a
$100,000.00
of
merchandise
was
stolen,
amp
would
survive.
if
mr.
perez’s
cash
box
--
if
mr.
miranda’s
cash
box
was
riffled
by
a
thief,
he
might
well
not
survive.
i
think
that
the
test
is
not
whether
--
the
test
is
not
that
the
criminal
activity
may
result
in
the
extermination
of
a
small
businessman
because
once
we
apply
that
test
i
think
we
have
opened
the
flood
gates
to
every
type
of
criminal
activity.
if
the
man
did
not
carry
automobile
insurance
and
he
was
in
an
accident
and
was
compelled
to
pay
a
heavy
judgment.
he
would
similarly
be
out
of
business.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
they
made
a
finding
sir
that
loan
sharking
activity
is
not
restricted
in
any
respect
to
small
business
activity.
they
have
found
that
loan
sharking
is
generally
utilized
by
the
person
who
is
unavailable
--
who
finds
other
credit
unavailable
be
he
a
small
businessman
or
a
large
businessman.
they
gave
instances
of
people
in
substantial
businesses
who’ve
turned
to
loan
sharks
because
of
their
financial
situation.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
thank
you.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
considering
the
constitutionality
of
title
ii
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
what
has
been
popularly
called
the
federal
anti-loan
sharking
statute.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
real
question
posed
is
whether
congress
may
constitutionally
enact
a
general
extortion
statute
because
in
truth
and
in
fact,
the
statute
enacted
by
congress
does
not
reach
in
the
true
sense
the
crime
of
loan
sharking.
loan
sharking,
if
we
follow
the
definition
of
that
crime
as
testified
to
at
the
hearings
before
congress
is
a
lending
at
a
usurious
rate
of
interest.
this
statute
does
not
include
anywhere
within
it.
those
activities
as
a
criminal
offense.
that
which
it
makes
criminal
is
extortion
and
extortion
of
the
broadest
tribe
covering
the
myriad
extortionate
activities
to
which
criminals
may
resort
in
our
varied
society.
even
though,
the
statute
continually
refers
to
the
term,
the
phrase,
extension
of
credit,
extension
of
credit
as
defined
by
the
statute
refers
not
only
to
a
debt
but
to
a
claim,
be
that
claim
valid
or
invalid,
acknowledged
or
not,
disputed
or
not,
however
arising,
so
long
as
the
satisfaction
of
that
claim
is
deferred.
the
hearings
before
congress
certainly
disclosed
and
it
may
well
be
assumed
that
organized
crime
is
intestate
in
character
and
that
organized
crime
may
have
as
one
of
its
substantial
sources
of
revenue,
loan
sharking,
that
is
the
lending
of
money
at
usurious
rates
of
interest.
but
there
is
nothing
within
the
proceedings
had
before
congress
which
would
warrant
the
broad
and
sweeping
finding
that
extortion
per
se
is
a
crime
which
belongs
in
a
federal
lexicon.
the
types
of
extortion
covered
here
may
well
include
the
incidental
extortion
to
which
a
loan
shark
may
resort
in
seeking
collection
of
a
debt,
of
a
lending.
it
may
also
include
an
irate
wage
earner
going
to
his
employer
and
demanding
wages.
it
may
include
an
irate
motorist
after
a
collision
saying
to
another
driver,
“you
will
pay
me
for
this
damage,
one
way
or
the
other
and
by
the
end
of
the
week.”
these
are
all
included
within
what
we
contend
as
any
reasonable
reading
of
the
definition
extension
of
credit.
certainly,
and
we
concede,
there
are
times
when
extortionate
means
are
employed
by
loan
sharks
but
what
congress
has
done
here
is
because
organized
crime
may
be
well
involved
in
loan
sharking
and
loan
sharking
at
some
time
may
involve
extortion,
then
all
extortion
regardless
of
how
it
arises
becomes
a
federal
offense.
we
respectfully
submit
that
such
a
statute
is
a
classic
case
of
overkill.
certainly,
congress
may
legislate
against
the
crime
of
extortion.
congress
has
done
so
in
1951,
1952,
the
travel
act.
congress
may
broaden
what
it
includes
as
a
federal
offense
in
extortion,
so
long
as
that
extortion
may
reasonably
be
connected
with
a
federal
interest.
the
federal
interest
however,
between
extortion
generally,
extortion
generally
appears
to
be
lacking.
the
federal
interest
connection
to
extortion
generally
appears
to
be
lacking.
certainly,
it
did
not
appear
within
the
hearings.
the
hearings
were
directed
at
a
specific
definable
class
of
activity.
congress,
in
seeking
to
legislate
against
an
organized
crime
activity
enacted
the
statute
and
congress
stated
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
strike
at
the
second
most
lucrative
source
of
revenue
for
organized
crime
loan
sharking.
there
is
nothing
within
the
proceedings
before
congress
which
characterized
extortion
as
a
uniquely
organized
crime
activity
or
that
extortion
per
se
is
a
lucrative
source
of
funds
for
organized
crime.
the
federal
pay
for
the
general
extortion
statute
is
lacking.
there
is
no
definable
class
of
activity
or
activities
whose
very
nature
might
compel
the
finding
of
the
federal
interest,
all
of
the
current
gambling
statute,
where
congress
instead
of
making
all
gambling
illegal
said
gambling
of
a
certain
type
has
characteristics
which
compel
the
finding
of
the
federal
interest
such
as
it
must
involve
--
the
gambling
activity
must
involve
five
or
more
people
deal
in
an
amount
in
excess
of
$2,000.00
on
a
daily
rate
or
be
an
activity
which
is
continued
for
30
days
or
more
and
that
the
gambling
activity
be
the
business
of
the
individuals.
here,
any,
if
i
may
say
occasional
extortioner,
finds
himself
fully
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
even
if
his
activity
is
totally
unrelated
to
loan
sharking,
the
vice
which
congress
was
seeking
to
control.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
means
that
congress
has
selected
to
control
loan
sharking,
these
means
are
far
too
broad,
far
too
inclusive
and
exceeds
the
authority
of
congress
both
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
under
the
bankruptcy
clause.
we
believe
and
we
do
not
argue
here
that
every
specific
criminal
statute
requires
a
recitation
that
there
must
be
proved
to
a
jury,
an
interstate
activity
or
that
an
interstate
facility
was
used.
we
do
believe
however,
that
in
a
criminal
statute
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
trial
level
if
not
of
the
interstate
activity
itself
or
the
use
of
the
interstate
facility
but
such
a
state
of
facts
as
warrant
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
interest
is
involved.
the
current--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
underlying
facts
in
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan
are
that
in
a
local
butcher’s
store
in
brooklyn,
mr.
miranda
was
the
owner
of
the
local
butcher’s
store
in
brooklyn,
that
he
needed
some
revenue.
he
was
not
able
to
obtain
monies
through
the
usual
sources
and
through
a
friend
was
introduced
to
a
petitioner.
the
petitioner
loaned
him
some
money
at
a
usurious
rate
of
interest.
eventually
the
--
mr.
miranda
was
unable
to
repay,
a
new
loans
worked
out,
again
at
usurious
rate
of
interest.
mr.
miranda
was
again
unable
to
repay
and
finally
extortionate
threats
were
made
to
mr.
miranda
to
attempt
to
effect
repayment.
there
were
no
interstate
facilities
used.
this
all
involved
a
transaction
occurring
in
brooklyn,
new
york
in
the
williamsburg
section.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
oh,
yes
your
honor.
there
was
extortion
under
the
proof
in
this
case,
there
was.
but
we
feel
that
the
fact
of
extortion
in
this
case
still
does
not
make
the
extortion
as
committed
by
the
defendant
here
a
federal
offense.
the
only
way
this
extortion
could
become
a
federal
offense
is
if
a
general
extortion
statute
were
part
of
a
federal
criminal
code
and
that
is
basically
what
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
is.
if
the
intent
of
congress
were
carried
out,
it
is
perhaps
quite
possible
that
mr.
perez’s
activities
would
fall
within
a
loan
sharking
definition
that
would
be
constitutionally
acceptable
but
we
are
dealing
not
with
such
a
statute.
i
repeat
we’re
dealing
with
a
general
extortion
statute
and
regardless
of
the
constant
reference
to
this
statute
as
a
loan
sharking
statute.
a
loan
sharking
statute,
its
basic
nature
is
not
changed.
the
congress
in
the
proposed
new
federal
criminal
code
treated
the
loan
sharking
statute
anew,
and
here
they
faced
up
to
the
problem
because
there
was
a
recognition
in
the
commentary
that
such
jurisdiction
referring
to
this
plenary
jurisdiction
over
extortionate
activity
may
well
be
over
broad
and
they
recognized
also
apparently
that
the
statute
--
the
current
statute
was
an
extortion
statute
and
they
rewrote.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
would
say
that
the
constitutional
difference
sir,
is
that
this
statute
just
generally
with
an
enormous
vacuum
cleaner
type
of
facts
sweeps
in
every
type
of
extortionate
activity
be
at
intrastate,
be
at
interstate,
be
it
connected
with
federal
interest,
be
it
not
connected
with
the
federal
interest.
a
loan
sharking
statute
such
as
the
one
that
appears
in
section
1771
of
the
proposed
code
defines
a
class
of
activity,
thereby
limiting
the
scope
of
the
statute.
it
legislates
against
loan
sharking
as
a
business.
it
implants
definitions
of
the
business,
the
character
of
the
business
and
the
nature
of
the
business
connects
it
with
organized
crime
activity,
so
that
the
casual
lender
just
as
the
casual
gambler
is
omitted
from
the
impact
of
federal
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
we
are
basically
dealing
sir,
with
matters
of
definition.
how
far
out
may
congress
reach
in
legislating
against
what
might
well
be
an
interstate
evil?
this
is
basically,
i
submit,
a
matter
of
scope.
it
is
true
that
extortion
within
the
loan
shark
gambit
may
be
reached
but
may
extortion
unrelated
to
the
loan
sharking
activity
be
reached
also.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
hearing
before
congress
so
state.
they
say
that
the
only
time
that
extortion
arises
is
when
there
is
a
failure
to
pay
that
loan
sharking
it’s
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
a
usurious
rate
of
interest.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
he
cannot
rely
of
course
upon
the
court
and
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
if
the
man
says
i
just
won’t
pay,
i
would
assume
that
the
loan
shark
would
then
have
to
resort
to
an
extortionate
pattern
of
conduct.
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
other
way.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
sir.
it
would
be
a
peculiarly
--
it
would
be
a
peculiar
part
of
loan
sharking
in
respect
of
that
part
of
loan
sharking
which
is
based
upon
a
failure
to
pay.
now,
we
certainly
are
well
aware
of
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
that’s
a
perfect
defense
to
the
loan,
if
the
loan
shark
would
so,
the
usurious
rate
of
interest
would
render
in
the
nature
of
a
defense,
the
loan
void
and
unenforceable
in
the
court,
yes.
but
we
also
have
the
situation
where
people
who
deal
with
loan
sharks
deal
to
a
great
extent
in
a
manner
of
trust
the
same
as
in
the
gambling
business
where
these
sort
of
obligations
apparently
are
honored.
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
an
extortioner
to
be
a
loan
shark.
and
i
think
that
the
hearing
in
it
bare
that
out.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
such
was
the
testimony,
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
are
many,
many
people
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
the
congressional
hearings,
that
there
are
many,
many
people
who
are
unable
to
resort
to
a
normal
avenues
of
commerce
in
order
to
obtain
loans
or
financing
and
the
specific
statement
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
mr.
medzker,
an
assistant
district
attorney
in
the
rocket
section
or
district
attorney
hogan’s
office
in
new
york
county
was
that
most
loan
sharking
transactions
are
amicable
transactions
in
their
commencement
and
in
their
conclusion.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
it
does
occur
sir.
it
does
occur,
mr.
chief
justice
but
it
isn’t
an
inherent
part
of
the
beast,
that
most
loan
sharking
transactions
according
to
what
we
find
from
the
congressional
hearings
and
amicably.
there
are
those
where
there
is
the
resort
to
extortion.
we
do
not
question
that
but
query
does
the
resort
to
extortion
in
'x'
percentage
of
loan
sharking
transactions
warrant
the
enactment
of
an
extortion’s
statute
which
reaches
all
and
every
type
of
extortion
to
which
the
human
mind
can
imagine
in
this
country,
and
make
that
a
federal
crime.
that,
i
think
is
the
basic
defect
in
the
statute.
certainly,
if
a
certain
type
of
extortionate
behavior
could
be
reasonably
be
defined
as
present
in
organized
crime
loan
sharking,
i
think
congress
could
legislate
against
that.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
originally,
it
was
$1,000.00.
it
went
up
to
$3,000.00
finally.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
oh,
i
would
estimate
well
and
excess
of
45%
which
is
mentioned
in
the
statute.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
it
was
payable
on
weekly
terms.
i
think
the
original
loan
was
a
thousand
dollars
payable
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
and
some
odd
dollars,
$105.00
a
week
for
14
weeks.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
when
mr.
miranda’s
business
proved
to
be
unsuccessful
and
he
was
unable
to
meet
the
payments.
the
petitioner
allegedly
went
to
mr.
miranda
and
told
him
that
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes,
sir
told
him
that
somebody
else
had
borrowed
from
them
and
had
and
paid
and
then
wound
up
in
the
hospital.
the
extortionate
character
of
the
statements
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no
one
was
hurt
if
that
is
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
he
wasn’t
successful.
i
think
one
payment
was
made
after
the
threat.
the
entire
debt
was
never
repaid.
the
defendant
was
arrested,
some
months
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
extortion
was
a
threat
of
bodily
injury
in
the
event
of
failure
to
pay
what
was
due
and
owing.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no.
no,
he
had
made
reference
to
other
people
to
another
person
who
had
gone
to
the
hospital.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
three
times.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
basically,
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
there
was
no
prosecution
brought
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
miranda
first
turned
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
the
city
police
and
i
am
unaware
as
to
what
happened
when
he
made
a
complaint
to
the
city
police
but
he
then
complained
to
the
fbi
and
then
about
a
month
after
he
complained
to
the
fbi.
the
petitioner
was
arrested.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
i
did
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
basically,
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
as
far
as
the
bankruptcy
clause
is
concerned
i
don’t
think
that
i
could
add
anything
to
what
judge
hay
said
in
the
dissent
in
this
case.
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
broad
reach
and
a
large
step
from
uniform
laws
on
bankruptcy
to
a
statute
such
as
this
dealing
with
extortion
generally.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
provided
that
the
loan
sharking
–
the
underlying
loan
sharking
was
connected
in
some
manner
with
a
federal
interest.
that
federal
interest
may
come
about
through
the
use
of
federal
facilities,
interstate
facilities
or
if
the
loan
sharking
activity
was
the
type
of
business,
was
proved
to
be
the
type
of
business
whereby
the
loan
sharking
would
be
thought
of
what
we
might
call
the
organized
crime
complex.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
it
should
be
proved
in
the
manner
in
which
suggested
in
the
proposed
code
where
they
say
there
should
be
proof
that
the
man
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
loan
sharking.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
loan
sharking
with
a
few
added
provisions
in
there
as
well.
i
don’t
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
the
statute
itself
which
of
course
would
be
part
of
the
proof
that
would
be
required
at
the
trial.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
as
the
sense
of
the
statute,
the
sense
of
the
hearings
is
to
attack
organized
crime.
there
should
be
requirement
that
there
is
an
organized
criminal
element
in
the
loan
sharking
transaction
against
which
the
prosecution
has
leveled.
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
gambling
statute,
they
seek
a
criminal
organization
in
order
to
bring
that
gambling
within
the
federal
gambit.
if
a
man
is
individually
a
loan
shark,
then
there
is
nothing
within
the
congressional
hearings
which
would
support
the
finding
that
he
has
an
impact
upon
interstate
commerce.
if
he
is
in
the
business
of
loan
sharking
and
he
utilizes
other
people,
then
he
may
well
be
engaged
in
an
organized
criminal
activity.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
if
he
is
in
an
organized
criminal
activity
and
congress
through
the
hearings
has
established
organized
criminal
activity
as
effecting
interstate
commerce,
it
may
well
be
that
under
the
wickard
against
filburn
rule,
he
may
find
himself
brought
in
within
the
gambit.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
do
not
contend
that
the
impact
on
interstate
commerce
has
to
be
proved
at
the
trial.
if
the
definition
of
a
criminal
activity
includes
within
it
such
provable
facts,
such
provable
facts
at
a
trial
level
as
of
necessity
linked
to
the
criminal
activity
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i’m
trying
to
equate
the
supposition
that
your
honor,
poses
with
the
federal
gambling
statute.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
but
they
used
certain
standards
sir
in
there
which
i
think
make
that
statute
not
necessarily
constitutionally
objectionable
as
opposed
to
this
statute.
they
say
their
man
should
be
in
the
business
of
gambling,
or
instance,
a
man
would
have
to
be
in
the
business
of
larceny
that
his
activity
by
definition
would
be
connected
with
organized
criminal
activity
which
has
been
established
before
congress
to
be
in
the
business
of
grand
larceny
of
the
type
and
nature
of
which
this
man
stands
accused
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well,
if
three
people
just
go
about
the
business
of
stealing,
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
federal
offense
nor
does
it
have
an
impact
upon
a
federal
interest.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
believe
so.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
did
not
intend
to
so
concede.
well,
then
i
made
a
mistake.
i
meant
to
surround
that
statement
with
other
things
such
as
organized
criminal
activity
of
a
nature
which
congress
has
found
to
be
part
of
organized
crime
which
congress
has
also
found
to
be
interstate
in
character
and
nature.
i
have
nothing
further
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
correct
one
impression
and
that
is
this
apparent
concession
of
mine
that
the
activities
of
mr.
perez
would
be
subject
to
a
federal
proscription.
i
do
not
intend
such
concession
and
i’m
intended
to
say
that
perhaps
congress
can
enact
the
statute
which
upon
the
addition
of
other
fact
that
is
not
present
in
this
case
could
reach
specific
loan
sharking.
the
case
as
it
has
come
here
affecting
the
specific
type
of
transaction
in
which
mr.
perez
engaged,
i
think
is
beyond
the
reach
of
congress.
it
cannot
be
the
subject
of
a
congressional
enactment.
i
think
that
all
necessary
points
have
been
covered
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well
i
think
that
that
would
cover
a
host
of
--
that
the
same
reasoning
could
be
applied
to
a
host
of
other
activities
to
pick
up
the
instance
which
mr.
justice
stewart
gave
in
regard
to
larceny.
certainly,
any
crime
which
affects
the
economic
stability
of
a
business
then
would
be
subject
to
federal
legislation.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well,
certainly
if
a
warehouse
of
amp
was
broken
into
and
a
$100,000.00
of
merchandise
was
stolen,
amp
would
survive.
if
mr.
perez’s
cash
box
--
if
mr.
miranda’s
cash
box
was
riffled
by
a
thief,
he
might
well
not
survive.
i
think
that
the
test
is
not
whether
--
the
test
is
not
that
the
criminal
activity
may
result
in
the
extermination
of
a
small
businessman
because
once
we
apply
that
test
i
think
we
have
opened
the
flood
gates
to
every
type
of
criminal
activity.
if
the
man
did
not
carry
automobile
insurance
and
he
was
in
an
accident
and
was
compelled
to
pay
a
heavy
judgment.
he
would
similarly
be
out
of
business.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
they
made
a
finding
sir
that
loan
sharking
activity
is
not
restricted
in
any
respect
to
small
business
activity.
they
have
found
that
loan
sharking
is
generally
utilized
by
the
person
who
is
unavailable
--
who
finds
other
credit
unavailable
be
he
a
small
businessman
or
a
large
businessman.
they
gave
instances
of
people
in
substantial
businesses
who’ve
turned
to
loan
sharks
because
of
their
financial
situation.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
thank
you.
