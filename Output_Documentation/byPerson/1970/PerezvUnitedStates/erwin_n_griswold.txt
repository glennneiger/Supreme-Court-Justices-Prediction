mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
there
was
a
divided
one
with
judges
feinberg
and
waterman
in
the
majority
and
judge
hayes
writing
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
question
is
solely
a
constitutional
one
and
no
question
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
or
the
weight
or
application
of
the
evidence
is
involved.
and
the
question
is
whether
title
ii
of
the
consumer
protection
act
enacted
in
1968
as
a
part
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
whether
that
is
constitutional.
and
specifically
section
894
which
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
the
government’s
brief
which
is
the
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
indicted
and
convicted
provides
that
whoever
knowingly
participates
in
any
way
or
conspires
to
do
so
and
no
conspiracies
involved
here
in
the
use
of
any
extortionate
means
to
collect
or
attempt
to
collect
any
extension
of
credit
or
to
punish
any
person
for
the
non-repayment
thereof
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000.00
or
imprisoned
no
more
than
20
years
or
both.
now
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
included
in
the
statute,
specific
findings
by
congress
and
these
are
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3.
they
are
the
result
of
extensive
consideration
and
hearings
in
congress
and
by
other
agencies.
we
have
outlined
beginning
on
pages
--
on
page
26
of
our
brief,
the
nature
of
the
information
which
was
before
congress
but
i
would
point
out
that
it
includes
extensive
consideration
of
a
report
by
the
new
york
state
commission
on
investigation
on
the
loan
shark
racket.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
section?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
not
sure
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don’t
--
no,
i
--
i’ll
ask
mr.
reynolds
to
give
me
a
note,
if
he
has
any
idea
what
that
refers
to.
in
addition
to
the
new
york
report,
it
was
referred
to
and
summarized
in
the
report
of
the
president’s
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
the
administration
of
justice
which
was
before
congress
and
two
of
the
task
force
reports
of
that
commission
which
where
before
congress
and
furthermore
there
was
further
information
before
congress
on
the
basis
of
which
by
formal
enactment,
the
congress
makes
the
following
findings.
one,
organized
crime
is
interstate
and
international
in
character
and
skipping
to
the
end
of
that
paragraph
is
substantial
part
of
the
income
of
organized
crime
is
generated
by
extortionate
credit
transactions
and
then
extortionate
credit
transactions
are
characterized
by
the
use
or
the
expressed
or
implicit
threat
or
the
use
of
violence
or
other
criminal
means
to
cause
harm
to
person,
reputation
or
property
as
a
means
of
enforcing
payment.
and
then
they
sentenced
that
i
cannot
give
more
information
about.
and
two
more
paragraphs
relating
to
findings
by
congress
with
respect
to
extortionate
credit
being
carried
on
extensively
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
through
the
means
and
instrumentalities
in
such
commerce
and
even
where
extortionate
credit
transactions
are
purely
intrastate
in
character,
they
nevertheless
directly
affect
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
and
extortionate
credit
transactions
directly
impair
the
effectiveness
and
frustrate
to
purposes
of
the
laws
enacted
by
congress
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcies
and
on
the
basis
of
these
findings
the
congress
determines
that
the
provisions
of
the
statute
including
that
involved
here
are
necessary
and
proper
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
into
execution
the
powers
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce
and
establish
uniform
and
effective
laws
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
i
will
rely
on
our
brief
for
that.
it
is
as
a
practical
matter
impossible
for
a
person
in
the
position
of
the
man
involved
here
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
bankruptcy
act
because
he
may
get
a
discharge
in
court
but
he
will
also
get
a
broken
arm
or
worse
from
the
enforcers
who
are
involved
here.
he
is
therefore
afraid
to
seek
bankruptcy
and
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
in
fact
thwarted
by
extortionate
credit
method.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
but
i
think
it
is
conceded
here
that
there
was
an
adequate
degree
of
extortion.
if
we
had
a
case
where
only
words
were
used,
now
really
you
are
a
very
low
fellow
because
you
don’t
repay
me
and
i
will
not
think
well
of
you
until
you
repay
me,
whether
that
is
extortion
or
not,
i
don’t
know.
i
suppose
that
extortion
involves
threats
of
violence
to
someone
or
threats
of
impairing
a
reputation
or
standing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
you
do
not
pay
me,
i
might?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
i
think
that
would
be
extorted
yes.
a
threat
to
do
bodily
harm,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
clear
instance
of
extortion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
krieger
i
think
made
the
statute
much
broader
that
congress
has
written
it.
congress
has
applied
threats
to
extortionate
credit
transactions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
a
real
threat,
yes.
i
think
there
maybe
a
question
of
degree
as
to
whether
relatively
mild
words
come
within
it.
there
is
certainly
no
problem
about
it
here.
the
man
involved
in
this
case
had
the
familiar
name
of
miranda.
he
was
26
years
old.
since
the
age
of
16,
he
had
worked
in
the
butcher
shop,
he
was
married.
he
wanted
to
setup
his
own
shop
which
he
did.
he
got
credit
from
suppliers
but
he
found
he
needed
more
cash
in
order
to
put
in
shelving
and
to
have
a
larger
stock
to
make
it
more
attractive.
he
went
to
the
chase,
manhattan
bank.
he
couldn’t
get
a
loan
which
was
understandable.
he
sought
information
about
small
business
administration,
he
was
told
it
would
take
eight
weeks
to
process
an
application
and
he
needed
the
money
sooner.
a
friend
told
him
that
he
could
get
the
money
through
the
defendant
in
this
case.
he
met
him
in
a
restaurant.
he
asked
for
a
$1000.
the
defendant
went
off
and
made
a
telephone
call
and
came
back
and
said
he
could
provide
$1000,
indicating
that
there
was
somebody
higher
up.
he
came
back
15
minutes
later
and
handed
him
the
$1000.
the
arrangement
was
that
he
was
to
pay
a
$105.00
a
week
for
14
weeks
which
would
be
$1,470.00
or
$470.00
interest
and
rather
less
than
third
of
a
year.
thereafter
he
demanded
a
$130.00
a
week
which
was
paid
for
a
while.
after
a
while
miranda
needed
$2,000.00
more
which
he
got.
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
make
further
payments
and
though
the
record
isn’t
wholly
clear,
we
have
pieced
it
out
and
it
appears
to
us
that
miranda
borrowed
a
total
of
$3,000.00
in
january
and
march
1968.
by
july
1968,
he
had
repaid
$6,000.00.
he
was
then
told
that
he
still
holds
$6,400.00,
thus
his
total
repayment
to
that
date
would
have
been
$12,400.00
on
a
$3,000.00
loan
or
interest
of
$9,400.00
on
a
$3,000.00
loan
held
for
less
than
six
months.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
crime
against
the
city
and
indeed
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
nothing
in
the
statute
shall
displace
in
any
way
any
local
remedy.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
is
an
effective
offense
against
the
federal
government
or
whether
congress
can
make
it
an
offense
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
a
question
of
standing.
this
defendant
is
the
defendant
and
the
criminal
charge
he
certainly
has
a
standing
to
be
here
to
raise
any
arguments
that
he
can
raise.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
but
he
doesn’t
concede
that
it
has
an
adequate
nexus
with
interstate
commerce
or
with
some
other
basis
of
federal
power.
incidentally
although
congress
made
no
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
statute
does
not
itself
have
any
requirement
in
it
that
the
particular
transaction
must
be
shown
to
have
a
relation
to
interstate
commerce.
perhaps
we
ought
to
ask
him
but
i
thought
on
this
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
had
said
this
conduct
might
be
made
a
crime
by
the
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
as
i
understand,
he
sought
to
withdraw
from
that
later
on.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
let
me
say,
i
was
going
to
take
some
time
to
refer
to
the
particular
extortion
that
acts
but
they
are
outlined
on
pages
7
to
9
of
our
brief
and
they
did
include
strong
threats
of
violence
not
only
to
miranda
but
also
to
his
wife.
as
i
have
been
working
on
this
case,
i
found
myself
repeatedly
with
the
feeling
that
i
have
heard
this
record
before.
by
that
i
don’t
mean
that
this
is
an
easy
case.
it
obviously
presents
a
problem
in
federalism
but
i
think
it
can
fairly
be
called
a
problem
in
constructive
or
creative
federalism.
indeed,
has
that
not
been
the
history
of
this
court’s
decisions
under
the
commerce
clause
beginning
with
gibbons
and
ogden,
a
140
years
ago.
it’s
true
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
court
took
a
rather
narrow
view
of
the
commerce
clause
as
in
hammer
and
dagenhart
and
in
carter
against
the
carter
coal
company.
but
those
decisions
did
not
stand
the
test
of
time
and
have
been
overruled.
in
many
other
cases
it
has
often
been
urged
on
the
court,
often
by
distinguished
counsel
that
particular
actions
taken
by
congress
extended
unduly
the
line
circumscribing
federal
power.
and
none
of
these
cases
was
easy.
but
again
and
again
the
court
has
upheld
the
exercise
of
federal
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
as
time
goes
on
it
becomes
clearer
and
clearer
in
the
view
of
history
that
these
decisions
have
been
sound
and
have
indeed
contributed
to
the
working
of
an
effective
federalism.
and
i
refer
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
fair
labor
standards
act
and
many
others
which
have
been
upheld.
nearly
50
years
ago,
in
1922
then
professor
philip
frankfurter
wrote
the
decisions
under
the
commerce
clause
either
allowing
or
confining
state
action
are
at
bottom,
acts
of
statesmanship.
and
he
quoted
a
passage
from
an
article
which
he
had
just
been
published
in
1922
by
thomas
repole,
the
dean
of
the
columbia
law
school.
professor
repole
said,
“the
court
has
drawn
its
lines
where
it
has
drawn
them
because
it
has
thought
it
wise
to
draw
them
there.
the
wisdom
of
its
wisdom
depends
upon
a
judgment
about
practical
matters
and
not
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
constitution.
and
another
passage
to
which
i
would
like
to
refer
in
the
general
portion
of
my
argument
comes
from
a
decision
of
this
court
more
than
25
years
ago.
the
interpenetrations
of
modern
society
have
not
wiped
out
state
lines.
it
is
not
for
us
to
make
inroads
upon
our
federal
system
either
by
indifference
to
its
maintenance
or
excessive
regard
for
the
unifying
forces
of
modern
technology.
scholastic
reasoning
may
prove
that
no
activity
is
isolated
within
the
boundaries
of
a
single
state
but
that
cannot
justify
absorption
of
legislative
power
by
the
united
states
over
every
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
the
old
admonition
never
becomes
still,
that
this
court
is
concerned
with
the
bounds
of
legal
power
and
not
with
the
bounds
of
wisdom
in
its
exercise
by
congress.
when
the
conduct
of
an
enterprise
affects
commerce
among
the
states
is
a
matter
of
practical
judgment
not
to
be
determined
by
abstract
notions.
the
exercise
of
this
practical
judgment,
the
constitution
entrusts
primarily
and
very
largely
to
congress
subject
to
the
ladders
controlled
by
the
electorate.
great
power
was
thus
given
to
the
congress.
the
power
of
legislation
and
thereby
the
power
of
passing
judgment
upon
the
needs
of
a
complex
society.
strictly
confined
though,
far
reaching
power
was
given
to
this
court,
that
in
determining
whether
the
congress
has
exceeded
limits
allowable
and
reason
for
the
judgment
which
it
has
exercised.
to
hold
that
to
effect
what
meant
a
practical
affairs
would
call
commerce.
and
to
deem
them
related
to
such
commerce
merely
by
gossamer
threats
and
not
by
solid
ties
would
be
to
disrespect
the
judgment
that
is
open
to
men
who
have
the
constitutional
power
and
responsibility
to
legislate
for
the
nation
and
that
comes
from
this
court’s
opinion
in
polish
national
alliance
against
the
national
labor
relation
board
decided
in
1944.
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
which
as
a
precedent,
clearly
requires
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
government
in
this
case.
but
the
problem
here
is
thoroughly
boxed
in
by
many
decisions
which
are
now
an
established
part
of
the
court’s
jurisprudence.
perhaps
the
closest
and
most
important
is
a
decision
of
more
than
50
years
ago,
the
great
opinion
by
justice
hughes
in
the
shreveport
case
in
234
u.s.
the
statue
involved
in
that
case
was
in
general
terms
without
any
reference
to
or
limitation
to
acts
burdening
or
affecting
interstate
commerce.
the
congress
provided
that
--
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
355
and
356
of
the
opinion
in
this
report
case,
“that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
common
carrier
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
act
to
make
or
give
any
undue
or
unreasonable
preference
or
advantage
to
any
particular
person,
company,
firm,
corporation
or
locality
in
any
respect
whatsoever
or
to
subject
any
particular
person,
company,
firm,
corporation
or
locality
to
any
undue
or
unreasonable
prejudice
or
disadvantage
in
any
respect
whatsoever.”
and
there’s
no
limitation
in
that
statute
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce.
and
the
court
will
recall
that
shreveport
case.
the
court
held
that
the
statute
was
broad
enough
to
apply
to
discrimination
in
intrastate
commerce
and
that
the
congress
had
the
constitutional
power
to
enact
that
statute.
we
come
good
many
years
later
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
first
great
decision
there
was
the
national
labor
relations
board
against
jones
and
laughlin
steel
company
in
301
u.s,
that
statute
by
its
terms
is
applicable
to
manufacturing
but
it
refers
to
matters
which
are
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce.
thus,
it
is
a
statute
which
is
worded
somewhat
differently
than
the
one
here
but
the
language
of
the
court
is
instructive.
on
page
37
of
301
u.s.
undoubtedly,
the
scope
of
this
power
must
be
considered
in
the
light
of
our
dual
system
of
government
and
may
not
be
extended
so
as
to
embrace
effects
upon
interstate
commerce
so
indirect
and
remote
that
to
embrace
them
in
view
of
our
complex
society
would
effectually
obliterate
the
distinction
between
what
is
national
and
what
is
local
and
create
a
completely
centralized
government.
and
we
of
course
make
no
contention
for
anything
of
that
sort
here.
we
make
no
suggestion
that
as
my
opponent
has
said
that
all
extortion
would
be
subject
to
federal
regulation.
the
only
extortion
which
is
involved
here
is
with
respect
to
credit
transactions.
there
are
other
powers
besides
the
commerce
power
and
the
bankruptcy
power
which
involved
credit,
the
power
for
example,
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
thereof
is
the
foundation
for
the
whole
national
bank
system,
the
federal
reserve
system
and
indeed
for
the
publicity
provisions
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
of
which
this
statute
is
a
part.
we
all
know
the
elementary
economics,
from
elementary
economics,
the
effect
of
credit
on
the
money
supply
and
certainly
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
the
next
case
to
which
i
would
refer
is
united
states
against
darby
in
312
u.s.
which
was
a
criminal
case
incidentally.
i
don’t
make
anything
of
the
point
that
judge
hayes
did
in
dissent
that
this
was
a
criminal
statute
and
of
course
criminal
statutes
must
be
carefully
and
narrowly
construed
but
no
question
of
construction
is
raised
in
this
case.
if
congress
has
power
in
this
area,
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
has
power
to
exercise,
to
impose
a
criminal
sanction
as
well
as
a
penalty
which
was
involved
in
wickard
and
filburn
or
regulation
as
was
involved
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
but
the
united
states
against
darby
was
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
applicable
to
goods
by
its
term
to
people
who
are
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
but
that
has
been
broadly
extended
in
recent
years
and
for
example
there
isn’t
the
slightest
doubt
that
mr.
miranda,
if
he
had
been
successful
in
operating
his
butcher
shop
would
have
been
subject
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
could
have
been
made
subject
to
it
and
also
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
but
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
turn
on
there
being
commerce
and
if
there
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
statute
than
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
which
we
haven’t
got
too
yet
and
i
hope
we
never
do
get
where
organized
crime
has
tentacles
which
reach
so
far
and
so
deep
and
the
states
find
that
they
are
unable
to
deal
with
it.
i
recall
for
example,
my
earlier
experience
in
the
department
of
justice
that
the
only
way
it
was
possible
to
proceed
against
al
capone
in
chicago
was
through
the
federal
income
tax.
the
state
authorities
were
unable
to
take
appropriate
steps,
and
i
can
imagine
other
circumstances
not
involved
here
which
might
induce
congress
to
pass
such
a
statute
and
if
congress
passed
such
a
statute
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
court
would
of
course,
give
very
careful
consideration
to
the
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
at
the
present
time
there
is
no
factual
basis
that
i
know
of
for
such
statute.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
obvious
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
extortionate
credit
transaction
here
directly
dealt
with
the
man
who
was
trying
to
engage
in
commerce
of
the
kind
which
congress
can
regulate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
such
transactions
do
not
so
frequently
recur
as
to
be
a
matter
which
is
a
proper
basis
for
national
concern
whereas
loan
sharking
is
on
the
basis
of
a
half
a
billion
dollars
a
year
at
least
in
the
economy
as
it
is
a
major
factor
in
the
economy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
about
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
you
will
persuade
me
that
such
a
federal
statute
would
have
a
constitutional
foundation.
and
it
is
not
involved
here,
and
i
think
that
the
factual
basis
for
saying
that
loan
sharking
has
an
important
bearing
on
commerce
is
a
strong
one.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
would
under
the
statute.
that
would
be
a
very
much
harder
case
than
this
but
on
such
a
matter
a
case
like
wickard
v.
filburn
seems
to
be
to
very
instructive
and
you
recall
will
that
that
involves
the
growing
of
239
bushels
of
wheat
on
an
intrastate
farm
in
the
center
of
the
state
which
wheat
was
as
all
consumed
on
that
farm
and
the
court
held
that
penalty
provisions
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
were
valid
and
applicable
to
that
case.
it
was
argued
that
what
was
involved
was
farming
and
not
commerce
but
the
court
--
there
is
a
particular
passage.
but
even
this
is
on
page
125,
but
even
if
appellee's
activity
be
local
and
though
it
may
not
be
regarded
as
commerce,
it
may
still
whatever
its
nature
be
reached
by
congress,
if
it
exerts
a
substantial
economic
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
and
this
irrespective
of
whether
such
effect
is
what
might
at
some
earlier
time
have
been
defined
as
direct
or
indirect.
and
there
the
239
bushels
of
wheat
were
founded
to
exert
an
adequate
effect
on
commerce
to
sustain
the
exercise
of
federal
power.
and
i’m
quite
willing
to
stand
on
the
proposition
that
if
it
can
be
shown
on
facts
put
before
congress,
that
grand
larceny
has
a
substantial
deterring
effect
on
commerce
that
congress,
if
in
its
judgment
it
decided
that
it
was
the
appropriate
thing
for
congress
to
do
would
have
that
power
and
it
should
be
sustained
by
the
court.
but
i
repeat
that
that
is
not
before
the
court
here.
what
we
have
here
is
loan
sharking
and
which
there
is
a
large
mass
of
material
to
support
the
proposition
that
it
has
an
important
bearing
on
commerce.
and
then
i
would
refer
to
the
case
of
katzenbach
against
mcclung
and
heart
of
atlanta
motel
against
united
states
where
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
or
1965
was
held
to
be
applicable
against
a
local
motel
in
one
case.
there,
the
statute
refers
to
transient
guests.
it
says
nothing
about
guests
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
the
transient
guest
might
all
have
been
within
georgia
as
far
as
the
statutory
language
is
concerned
there
but
the
court
found
no
difficulty
with
that.
and
in
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
the
statute
did
provide
that
it
served
interstate
travelers
or
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
moved
in
commerce.
the
last
case
which
seems
to
me
to
be
very
strong
in
this
area
is
maryland
against
wirtz
where
the
court
held
that
the
fair
labor
standard
act
could
be
applied
to
all
employees
of
a
business
even
though
those
employees
were
not
engaged
in
commerce
if
any
of
the
employees
were
engaged
in
commerce.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
make
reference
just
to
one
case
cited
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
defendant
united
states
against
denmark
which
he
says
controls
this.
that
is
a
case
27
years
ago
where
there
was
no
opinion
for
the
court.
it’s
rather
refreshing
to
see
that
these
things
happened
in
other
times.
three
justices
held
that
a
statute
with
respect
to
the
registration
of
gambling
equipment
should
not
be
construed
to
apply
to
the
registration
of
intrastate
gambling
devices.
two
justices,
justices
black
and
douglas,
the
only
two
of
that
court
who
are
still
here
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague
so
that
there
were
five
votes
against
sustaining
the
conviction
and
four
justices
held
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
apply
and
was
constitutional.
it’s
clear
that
there’s
no
judgment
or
opinion
in
that
case
which
is
authoritative.
and
this
case,
our
submission
is
that
this
statue
adequately
based
on
findings
of
fact
made
by
congress
after
full
and
careful
consideration
of
a
difficult
national
problem
though
not
squarely
supported
by
any
prior
case,
is
but
to
stop
on
all
sides
by
firm
decisions
of
this
court
and
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
there
was
a
divided
one
with
judges
feinberg
and
waterman
in
the
majority
and
judge
hayes
writing
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
question
is
solely
a
constitutional
one
and
no
question
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
or
the
weight
or
application
of
the
evidence
is
involved.
and
the
question
is
whether
title
ii
of
the
consumer
protection
act
enacted
in
1968
as
a
part
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
whether
that
is
constitutional.
and
specifically
section
894
which
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
the
government’s
brief
which
is
the
statute
under
which
the
defendant
was
indicted
and
convicted
provides
that
whoever
knowingly
participates
in
any
way
or
conspires
to
do
so
and
no
conspiracies
involved
here
in
the
use
of
any
extortionate
means
to
collect
or
attempt
to
collect
any
extension
of
credit
or
to
punish
any
person
for
the
non-repayment
thereof
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000.00
or
imprisoned
no
more
than
20
years
or
both.
now
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
included
in
the
statute,
specific
findings
by
congress
and
these
are
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3.
they
are
the
result
of
extensive
consideration
and
hearings
in
congress
and
by
other
agencies.
we
have
outlined
beginning
on
pages
--
on
page
26
of
our
brief,
the
nature
of
the
information
which
was
before
congress
but
i
would
point
out
that
it
includes
extensive
consideration
of
a
report
by
the
new
york
state
commission
on
investigation
on
the
loan
shark
racket.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
section?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
not
sure
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
don’t
--
no,
i
--
i’ll
ask
mr.
reynolds
to
give
me
a
note,
if
he
has
any
idea
what
that
refers
to.
in
addition
to
the
new
york
report,
it
was
referred
to
and
summarized
in
the
report
of
the
president’s
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
the
administration
of
justice
which
was
before
congress
and
two
of
the
task
force
reports
of
that
commission
which
where
before
congress
and
furthermore
there
was
further
information
before
congress
on
the
basis
of
which
by
formal
enactment,
the
congress
makes
the
following
findings.
one,
organized
crime
is
interstate
and
international
in
character
and
skipping
to
the
end
of
that
paragraph
is
substantial
part
of
the
income
of
organized
crime
is
generated
by
extortionate
credit
transactions
and
then
extortionate
credit
transactions
are
characterized
by
the
use
or
the
expressed
or
implicit
threat
or
the
use
of
violence
or
other
criminal
means
to
cause
harm
to
person,
reputation
or
property
as
a
means
of
enforcing
payment.
and
then
they
sentenced
that
i
cannot
give
more
information
about.
and
two
more
paragraphs
relating
to
findings
by
congress
with
respect
to
extortionate
credit
being
carried
on
extensively
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
through
the
means
and
instrumentalities
in
such
commerce
and
even
where
extortionate
credit
transactions
are
purely
intrastate
in
character,
they
nevertheless
directly
affect
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
and
extortionate
credit
transactions
directly
impair
the
effectiveness
and
frustrate
to
purposes
of
the
laws
enacted
by
congress
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcies
and
on
the
basis
of
these
findings
the
congress
determines
that
the
provisions
of
the
statute
including
that
involved
here
are
necessary
and
proper
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
into
execution
the
powers
of
congress
to
regulate
commerce
and
establish
uniform
and
effective
laws
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
i
will
rely
on
our
brief
for
that.
it
is
as
a
practical
matter
impossible
for
a
person
in
the
position
of
the
man
involved
here
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
bankruptcy
act
because
he
may
get
a
discharge
in
court
but
he
will
also
get
a
broken
arm
or
worse
from
the
enforcers
who
are
involved
here.
he
is
therefore
afraid
to
seek
bankruptcy
and
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
in
fact
thwarted
by
extortionate
credit
method.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
but
i
think
it
is
conceded
here
that
there
was
an
adequate
degree
of
extortion.
if
we
had
a
case
where
only
words
were
used,
now
really
you
are
a
very
low
fellow
because
you
don’t
repay
me
and
i
will
not
think
well
of
you
until
you
repay
me,
whether
that
is
extortion
or
not,
i
don’t
know.
i
suppose
that
extortion
involves
threats
of
violence
to
someone
or
threats
of
impairing
a
reputation
or
standing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
you
do
not
pay
me,
i
might?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
i
think
that
would
be
extorted
yes.
a
threat
to
do
bodily
harm,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
clear
instance
of
extortion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
krieger
i
think
made
the
statute
much
broader
that
congress
has
written
it.
congress
has
applied
threats
to
extortionate
credit
transactions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
a
real
threat,
yes.
i
think
there
maybe
a
question
of
degree
as
to
whether
relatively
mild
words
come
within
it.
there
is
certainly
no
problem
about
it
here.
the
man
involved
in
this
case
had
the
familiar
name
of
miranda.
he
was
26
years
old.
since
the
age
of
16,
he
had
worked
in
the
butcher
shop,
he
was
married.
he
wanted
to
setup
his
own
shop
which
he
did.
he
got
credit
from
suppliers
but
he
found
he
needed
more
cash
in
order
to
put
in
shelving
and
to
have
a
larger
stock
to
make
it
more
attractive.
he
went
to
the
chase,
manhattan
bank.
he
couldn’t
get
a
loan
which
was
understandable.
he
sought
information
about
small
business
administration,
he
was
told
it
would
take
eight
weeks
to
process
an
application
and
he
needed
the
money
sooner.
a
friend
told
him
that
he
could
get
the
money
through
the
defendant
in
this
case.
he
met
him
in
a
restaurant.
he
asked
for
a
$1000.
the
defendant
went
off
and
made
a
telephone
call
and
came
back
and
said
he
could
provide
$1000,
indicating
that
there
was
somebody
higher
up.
he
came
back
15
minutes
later
and
handed
him
the
$1000.
the
arrangement
was
that
he
was
to
pay
a
$105.00
a
week
for
14
weeks
which
would
be
$1,470.00
or
$470.00
interest
and
rather
less
than
third
of
a
year.
thereafter
he
demanded
a
$130.00
a
week
which
was
paid
for
a
while.
after
a
while
miranda
needed
$2,000.00
more
which
he
got.
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
make
further
payments
and
though
the
record
isn’t
wholly
clear,
we
have
pieced
it
out
and
it
appears
to
us
that
miranda
borrowed
a
total
of
$3,000.00
in
january
and
march
1968.
by
july
1968,
he
had
repaid
$6,000.00.
he
was
then
told
that
he
still
holds
$6,400.00,
thus
his
total
repayment
to
that
date
would
have
been
$12,400.00
on
a
$3,000.00
loan
or
interest
of
$9,400.00
on
a
$3,000.00
loan
held
for
less
than
six
months.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
crime
against
the
city
and
indeed
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
nothing
in
the
statute
shall
displace
in
any
way
any
local
remedy.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
is
an
effective
offense
against
the
federal
government
or
whether
congress
can
make
it
an
offense
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
a
question
of
standing.
this
defendant
is
the
defendant
and
the
criminal
charge
he
certainly
has
a
standing
to
be
here
to
raise
any
arguments
that
he
can
raise.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
but
he
doesn’t
concede
that
it
has
an
adequate
nexus
with
interstate
commerce
or
with
some
other
basis
of
federal
power.
incidentally
although
congress
made
no
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
the
statute
does
not
itself
have
any
requirement
in
it
that
the
particular
transaction
must
be
shown
to
have
a
relation
to
interstate
commerce.
perhaps
we
ought
to
ask
him
but
i
thought
on
this
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
had
said
this
conduct
might
be
made
a
crime
by
the
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
as
i
understand,
he
sought
to
withdraw
from
that
later
on.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
let
me
say,
i
was
going
to
take
some
time
to
refer
to
the
particular
extortion
that
acts
but
they
are
outlined
on
pages
7
to
9
of
our
brief
and
they
did
include
strong
threats
of
violence
not
only
to
miranda
but
also
to
his
wife.
as
i
have
been
working
on
this
case,
i
found
myself
repeatedly
with
the
feeling
that
i
have
heard
this
record
before.
by
that
i
don’t
mean
that
this
is
an
easy
case.
it
obviously
presents
a
problem
in
federalism
but
i
think
it
can
fairly
be
called
a
problem
in
constructive
or
creative
federalism.
indeed,
has
that
not
been
the
history
of
this
court’s
decisions
under
the
commerce
clause
beginning
with
gibbons
and
ogden,
a
140
years
ago.
it’s
true
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
court
took
a
rather
narrow
view
of
the
commerce
clause
as
in
hammer
and
dagenhart
and
in
carter
against
the
carter
coal
company.
but
those
decisions
did
not
stand
the
test
of
time
and
have
been
overruled.
in
many
other
cases
it
has
often
been
urged
on
the
court,
often
by
distinguished
counsel
that
particular
actions
taken
by
congress
extended
unduly
the
line
circumscribing
federal
power.
and
none
of
these
cases
was
easy.
but
again
and
again
the
court
has
upheld
the
exercise
of
federal
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
as
time
goes
on
it
becomes
clearer
and
clearer
in
the
view
of
history
that
these
decisions
have
been
sound
and
have
indeed
contributed
to
the
working
of
an
effective
federalism.
and
i
refer
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
fair
labor
standards
act
and
many
others
which
have
been
upheld.
nearly
50
years
ago,
in
1922
then
professor
philip
frankfurter
wrote
the
decisions
under
the
commerce
clause
either
allowing
or
confining
state
action
are
at
bottom,
acts
of
statesmanship.
and
he
quoted
a
passage
from
an
article
which
he
had
just
been
published
in
1922
by
thomas
repole,
the
dean
of
the
columbia
law
school.
professor
repole
said,
“the
court
has
drawn
its
lines
where
it
has
drawn
them
because
it
has
thought
it
wise
to
draw
them
there.
the
wisdom
of
its
wisdom
depends
upon
a
judgment
about
practical
matters
and
not
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
constitution.
and
another
passage
to
which
i
would
like
to
refer
in
the
general
portion
of
my
argument
comes
from
a
decision
of
this
court
more
than
25
years
ago.
the
interpenetrations
of
modern
society
have
not
wiped
out
state
lines.
it
is
not
for
us
to
make
inroads
upon
our
federal
system
either
by
indifference
to
its
maintenance
or
excessive
regard
for
the
unifying
forces
of
modern
technology.
scholastic
reasoning
may
prove
that
no
activity
is
isolated
within
the
boundaries
of
a
single
state
but
that
cannot
justify
absorption
of
legislative
power
by
the
united
states
over
every
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
the
old
admonition
never
becomes
still,
that
this
court
is
concerned
with
the
bounds
of
legal
power
and
not
with
the
bounds
of
wisdom
in
its
exercise
by
congress.
when
the
conduct
of
an
enterprise
affects
commerce
among
the
states
is
a
matter
of
practical
judgment
not
to
be
determined
by
abstract
notions.
the
exercise
of
this
practical
judgment,
the
constitution
entrusts
primarily
and
very
largely
to
congress
subject
to
the
ladders
controlled
by
the
electorate.
great
power
was
thus
given
to
the
congress.
the
power
of
legislation
and
thereby
the
power
of
passing
judgment
upon
the
needs
of
a
complex
society.
strictly
confined
though,
far
reaching
power
was
given
to
this
court,
that
in
determining
whether
the
congress
has
exceeded
limits
allowable
and
reason
for
the
judgment
which
it
has
exercised.
to
hold
that
to
effect
what
meant
a
practical
affairs
would
call
commerce.
and
to
deem
them
related
to
such
commerce
merely
by
gossamer
threats
and
not
by
solid
ties
would
be
to
disrespect
the
judgment
that
is
open
to
men
who
have
the
constitutional
power
and
responsibility
to
legislate
for
the
nation
and
that
comes
from
this
court’s
opinion
in
polish
national
alliance
against
the
national
labor
relation
board
decided
in
1944.
i
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
which
as
a
precedent,
clearly
requires
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
government
in
this
case.
but
the
problem
here
is
thoroughly
boxed
in
by
many
decisions
which
are
now
an
established
part
of
the
court’s
jurisprudence.
perhaps
the
closest
and
most
important
is
a
decision
of
more
than
50
years
ago,
the
great
opinion
by
justice
hughes
in
the
shreveport
case
in
234
u.s.
the
statue
involved
in
that
case
was
in
general
terms
without
any
reference
to
or
limitation
to
acts
burdening
or
affecting
interstate
commerce.
the
congress
provided
that
--
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
355
and
356
of
the
opinion
in
this
report
case,
“that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
common
carrier
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
act
to
make
or
give
any
undue
or
unreasonable
preference
or
advantage
to
any
particular
person,
company,
firm,
corporation
or
locality
in
any
respect
whatsoever
or
to
subject
any
particular
person,
company,
firm,
corporation
or
locality
to
any
undue
or
unreasonable
prejudice
or
disadvantage
in
any
respect
whatsoever.”
and
there’s
no
limitation
in
that
statute
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce.
and
the
court
will
recall
that
shreveport
case.
the
court
held
that
the
statute
was
broad
enough
to
apply
to
discrimination
in
intrastate
commerce
and
that
the
congress
had
the
constitutional
power
to
enact
that
statute.
we
come
good
many
years
later
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
first
great
decision
there
was
the
national
labor
relations
board
against
jones
and
laughlin
steel
company
in
301
u.s,
that
statute
by
its
terms
is
applicable
to
manufacturing
but
it
refers
to
matters
which
are
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce.
thus,
it
is
a
statute
which
is
worded
somewhat
differently
than
the
one
here
but
the
language
of
the
court
is
instructive.
on
page
37
of
301
u.s.
undoubtedly,
the
scope
of
this
power
must
be
considered
in
the
light
of
our
dual
system
of
government
and
may
not
be
extended
so
as
to
embrace
effects
upon
interstate
commerce
so
indirect
and
remote
that
to
embrace
them
in
view
of
our
complex
society
would
effectually
obliterate
the
distinction
between
what
is
national
and
what
is
local
and
create
a
completely
centralized
government.
and
we
of
course
make
no
contention
for
anything
of
that
sort
here.
we
make
no
suggestion
that
as
my
opponent
has
said
that
all
extortion
would
be
subject
to
federal
regulation.
the
only
extortion
which
is
involved
here
is
with
respect
to
credit
transactions.
there
are
other
powers
besides
the
commerce
power
and
the
bankruptcy
power
which
involved
credit,
the
power
for
example,
to
coin
money
and
regulate
the
value
thereof
is
the
foundation
for
the
whole
national
bank
system,
the
federal
reserve
system
and
indeed
for
the
publicity
provisions
of
the
truth
in
lending
act
of
which
this
statute
is
a
part.
we
all
know
the
elementary
economics,
from
elementary
economics,
the
effect
of
credit
on
the
money
supply
and
certainly
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
the
next
case
to
which
i
would
refer
is
united
states
against
darby
in
312
u.s.
which
was
a
criminal
case
incidentally.
i
don’t
make
anything
of
the
point
that
judge
hayes
did
in
dissent
that
this
was
a
criminal
statute
and
of
course
criminal
statutes
must
be
carefully
and
narrowly
construed
but
no
question
of
construction
is
raised
in
this
case.
if
congress
has
power
in
this
area,
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
has
power
to
exercise,
to
impose
a
criminal
sanction
as
well
as
a
penalty
which
was
involved
in
wickard
and
filburn
or
regulation
as
was
involved
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
but
the
united
states
against
darby
was
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
applicable
to
goods
by
its
term
to
people
who
are
engaged
in
commerce
or
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce.
but
that
has
been
broadly
extended
in
recent
years
and
for
example
there
isn’t
the
slightest
doubt
that
mr.
miranda,
if
he
had
been
successful
in
operating
his
butcher
shop
would
have
been
subject
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
could
have
been
made
subject
to
it
and
also
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
but
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
turn
on
there
being
commerce
and
if
there
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
statute
than
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
which
we
haven’t
got
too
yet
and
i
hope
we
never
do
get
where
organized
crime
has
tentacles
which
reach
so
far
and
so
deep
and
the
states
find
that
they
are
unable
to
deal
with
it.
i
recall
for
example,
my
earlier
experience
in
the
department
of
justice
that
the
only
way
it
was
possible
to
proceed
against
al
capone
in
chicago
was
through
the
federal
income
tax.
the
state
authorities
were
unable
to
take
appropriate
steps,
and
i
can
imagine
other
circumstances
not
involved
here
which
might
induce
congress
to
pass
such
a
statute
and
if
congress
passed
such
a
statute
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
court
would
of
course,
give
very
careful
consideration
to
the
problem.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
at
the
present
time
there
is
no
factual
basis
that
i
know
of
for
such
statute.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
obvious
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
extortionate
credit
transaction
here
directly
dealt
with
the
man
who
was
trying
to
engage
in
commerce
of
the
kind
which
congress
can
regulate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
such
transactions
do
not
so
frequently
recur
as
to
be
a
matter
which
is
a
proper
basis
for
national
concern
whereas
loan
sharking
is
on
the
basis
of
a
half
a
billion
dollars
a
year
at
least
in
the
economy
as
it
is
a
major
factor
in
the
economy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
about
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
you
will
persuade
me
that
such
a
federal
statute
would
have
a
constitutional
foundation.
and
it
is
not
involved
here,
and
i
think
that
the
factual
basis
for
saying
that
loan
sharking
has
an
important
bearing
on
commerce
is
a
strong
one.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
would
under
the
statute.
that
would
be
a
very
much
harder
case
than
this
but
on
such
a
matter
a
case
like
wickard
v.
filburn
seems
to
be
to
very
instructive
and
you
recall
will
that
that
involves
the
growing
of
239
bushels
of
wheat
on
an
intrastate
farm
in
the
center
of
the
state
which
wheat
was
as
all
consumed
on
that
farm
and
the
court
held
that
penalty
provisions
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
were
valid
and
applicable
to
that
case.
it
was
argued
that
what
was
involved
was
farming
and
not
commerce
but
the
court
--
there
is
a
particular
passage.
but
even
this
is
on
page
125,
but
even
if
appellee's
activity
be
local
and
though
it
may
not
be
regarded
as
commerce,
it
may
still
whatever
its
nature
be
reached
by
congress,
if
it
exerts
a
substantial
economic
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
and
this
irrespective
of
whether
such
effect
is
what
might
at
some
earlier
time
have
been
defined
as
direct
or
indirect.
and
there
the
239
bushels
of
wheat
were
founded
to
exert
an
adequate
effect
on
commerce
to
sustain
the
exercise
of
federal
power.
and
i’m
quite
willing
to
stand
on
the
proposition
that
if
it
can
be
shown
on
facts
put
before
congress,
that
grand
larceny
has
a
substantial
deterring
effect
on
commerce
that
congress,
if
in
its
judgment
it
decided
that
it
was
the
appropriate
thing
for
congress
to
do
would
have
that
power
and
it
should
be
sustained
by
the
court.
but
i
repeat
that
that
is
not
before
the
court
here.
what
we
have
here
is
loan
sharking
and
which
there
is
a
large
mass
of
material
to
support
the
proposition
that
it
has
an
important
bearing
on
commerce.
and
then
i
would
refer
to
the
case
of
katzenbach
against
mcclung
and
heart
of
atlanta
motel
against
united
states
where
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
or
1965
was
held
to
be
applicable
against
a
local
motel
in
one
case.
there,
the
statute
refers
to
transient
guests.
it
says
nothing
about
guests
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
the
transient
guest
might
all
have
been
within
georgia
as
far
as
the
statutory
language
is
concerned
there
but
the
court
found
no
difficulty
with
that.
and
in
katzenbach
against
mcclung,
the
statute
did
provide
that
it
served
interstate
travelers
or
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
moved
in
commerce.
the
last
case
which
seems
to
me
to
be
very
strong
in
this
area
is
maryland
against
wirtz
where
the
court
held
that
the
fair
labor
standard
act
could
be
applied
to
all
employees
of
a
business
even
though
those
employees
were
not
engaged
in
commerce
if
any
of
the
employees
were
engaged
in
commerce.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
make
reference
just
to
one
case
cited
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
defendant
united
states
against
denmark
which
he
says
controls
this.
that
is
a
case
27
years
ago
where
there
was
no
opinion
for
the
court.
it’s
rather
refreshing
to
see
that
these
things
happened
in
other
times.
three
justices
held
that
a
statute
with
respect
to
the
registration
of
gambling
equipment
should
not
be
construed
to
apply
to
the
registration
of
intrastate
gambling
devices.
two
justices,
justices
black
and
douglas,
the
only
two
of
that
court
who
are
still
here
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague
so
that
there
were
five
votes
against
sustaining
the
conviction
and
four
justices
held
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
apply
and
was
constitutional.
it’s
clear
that
there’s
no
judgment
or
opinion
in
that
case
which
is
authoritative.
and
this
case,
our
submission
is
that
this
statue
adequately
based
on
findings
of
fact
made
by
congress
after
full
and
careful
consideration
of
a
difficult
national
problem
though
not
squarely
supported
by
any
prior
case,
is
but
to
stop
on
all
sides
by
firm
decisions
of
this
court
and
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
