mr.
john
f.
dienelt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
five-count
information
alleging
violations
of
section
834
of
title
18
which
deals
with
the
transportation
of
explosives
and
other
dangerous
substances.
section
834
which
we
have
set
forth
in
part
on
page
3
of
our
brief
provides
that
“whoever
knowingly
violates
regulations
formulated
for
the
safe
transportation
of
hazardous
materials
shall
be
fined
up
to
$1,000.00
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
a
year.”
the
information
in
this
case
charge
the
appellee
which
is
a
corporation
engaged
primarily
in
the
manufacturing
and
shipping
of
chemicals
and
fertilizers
with
violations
of
a
regulation,
which
we’ve
also
set
forth
on
page
3,
dealing
with
the
contents
of
shipping
papers.
the
regulation
requires
that
the
shipper
state
on
a
shipping
paper
designated
names
and
classifications
of
substances
which
he
is
shipping.
in
this
case,
for
example
the
shipper
was
shipping
sulfuric
acid
and
the
regulations
required
him
to
state
sulfuric
acid
on
the
shipping
paper
which
is
the
name
and
corrosive
liquid,
which
is
the
classification.
and
this
safety
requirement
serves
essentially
two
purposes.
first,
it
indicates
to
the
carrier
what
kind
of
labels
he
should
put
on
the
packages
and
what
kind
of
placards
he
should
put
on
his
truck.
and
secondly,
the
shipping
paper
itself
which
is
kept
in
cab
of
the
truck
with
the
driver
enables
the
driver
or
anybody
else
who
might
be
involved
in
an
emergency
such
as
an
accident
or
a
fire
to
quickly
identify
what
the
substance
is
and
to
take
whatever
appropriate
steps
such
clearing
an
area
might
be
necessary.
the
five
counts
in
this
information
each
alleged
similar
conduct.
three
of
them
alleged
a
knowing
failure
to
state
the
required
classification
and
as
corrosive
liquid
on
the
shipping
papers.
and
two,
alleged
knowing
failure
to
state
both
the
required
classification
and
the
required
name
of
the
substance
being
shipped.
the
district
court
granted
the
appellee’s
motion
to
dismiss
this
information
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
state
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
and
that
essential
element
in
the
court’s
language
was
knowledge
of
violating
the
regulation.
as
we
read
that
ruling,
the
district
court
held
that
the
government
has
to
allege
and
prove
not
only
that
the
appellee
knew
it
was
shipping
a
dangerous
article
without
stating
its
proper
name
and
classification
on
the
shipping
papers,
which
we
alleged
in
the
information
but
also
that
it
knew
the
terms
of
the
regulation
forbidding
that
conduct
and
specifically
intended
to
violate
that
regulation
or
as
the
district
court
put
it,
an
added
ingredient
of
consciousness
that
it’s
illegal
not
to
do
the
act.
so,
the
question
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
yes,
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
gather
it
was,
i
didn’t
know.
the
question
in
the
case
then
is
the
simple
one
and
it’s
whether
a
defendant
can
be
convicted
under
this
statute
for
intentionally
engaging
in
conduct
that
is
prohibited
even
though
he
doesn’t
know
that
the
law
prohibits
it.
we
believe
that
a
shipper
or
carrier
can
be
convicted
under
these
circumstances.
our
position
is
simply
that
proof
of
knowledge
of
pertinent
the
facts
is
what
is
essential
and
proof
of
knowledge
of
law
is
not
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
know
the
regulations
governing
transportation
of
dangerous
articles.
now,
he's
charge
with
that
knowledge
under
the
fundamental
principle
that
ignorance
of
the
law
does
not
excuse
its
violations
by
one
who
intentionally
engages
in
conduct
which
the
law
forbids.
charging
shippers
and
carriers
of
dangerous
substances
with
knowledge
of
regulations
regarding
their
transport
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
to
do.
in
the
first
place,
the
substances
are
dangerous
and
that
alone
ought
to
signal,
the
possibility
of
existence
of
a
regulatory
scheme
regarding
the
transportation.
so
this
case
in
that
sense
is
similar
to
united
states
against
freed
which
this
court
decided
this
month.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
ruled
that
specific
intent
for
knowledge
that
gun
were
unregistered
was
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
of
possession
of
an
unregistered
firearm.
in
effect,
that
the
rule
that
the
individual
could
be
presumed
to
know
or
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
registration
requirement.
in
this
case
and
in
numerous
regulatory
areas,
there's
another
factor
which
makes
it
particularly
appropriate
to
charge
the
people
engaged
in
forbidden
conduct
with
knowledge
of
the
regulations
and
that
is
that
this
appellee
and
most
of
the
people
who
are
brought
under
a
prosecution
under
this
statute
are
in
the
business
of
shipping
dangerous
substances.
so,
our
fundamental
position
is
that
there
is
no
basis
in
this
case
for
making
an
exception
to
the
principle
that
ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
excuse.
we’d
like
to
emphasize
three
points
in
that
connection.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
effect
of
this
court’s
decision
in
boyce
motor
lines
against
the
united
states,
some
20
years
ago
in
342
u.s.,
and
the
history
of
the
statute.
the
first
point
deals
with
the
language,
the
statute
says,
“knowingly
violates
regulations.”
this
is
a
typical
regulatory
pattern
in
numerous
areas
where
congress
simply
can’t
fill
out
the
details
of
the
statute.
it
sets
forth
the
general
prohibition
and
leaves
to
the
administrative
agency
the
responsibility
for
filling
in
the
details
and
designating
the
specific
conduct
that’s
forbidden.
and
this
language
“knowingly
violates
regulations”
is
standard
terminology.
it’s
used
in
numerous
statutes
we've
cited,
some
of
them
in
footnote
7
of
our
brief
at
page
13.
we
submit
that
if
congress
in
these
various
regulatory
areas
had
set
forth
the
prohibited
conduct
in
the
statute
itself,
there
wouldn’t
be
any
question
but
that
the
government’s
only
obligation
would
be
to
prove
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
not
knowledge
of
the
law.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
congress
had
written
a
statute
that
says,
“whoever
knowingly
ships
sulfuric
acid
without
stating
on
the
shipping
papers
that
it
is
sulfuric
acid
and
that
it
is
a
corrosive
liquid
shall
be
punished.”
we
submit
in
that
situation
there
wouldn’t
be
any
question
that
our
burden
of
proof
would
be
what
we've
alleged
in
the
information
here,
knowing
conduct.
similarly,
if
congress
had
written
as
is
it
would
have
had
to
in
a
regulatory
statute
or
as
it
likely
would
and
as
it
has
in
cases
where
it
has
set
forth
conduct
that
is
prohibited
in
the
statute
itself,
set
forth
a
number
of
different
kinds
of
conduct
and
then
had
one
provision
that
says,
“whoever
knowingly
violates
the
statute
or
the
statutory
provisions
shall
be
punished.”
we
submit
the
same
result
would
obtain
that
we
would
have
to
prove
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
not
knowledge
of
the
law.
we
don’t
think
the
results
shall
be
any
different
because
congress
has
adopted
a
convenient
shorthand
in
this
case
as
a
means
of
delegating
responsibility
to
the
administrative
agency.
in
this
case,
the
department
of
transportation
and
for
incorporating
all
the
various
prohibitions
that
are
involved.
we
realize
it’s
possible
to
read
the
language
“knowingly
violate
regulations”
to
suggest
that
you
have
to
know
what
the
regulation
is.
but
we
think
that
the
position
which
evidently
is
the
appellee’s
position
and
which
was
the
position
stated
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
judge
magruder
in
the
st.
johnsbury
trucking
case
which
was
a
leading
early
court
of
appeals
decision
on
this
matter,
that
the
use
of
that
language
justifies
a
distinction
.we
don’t
believe
that
that’s
a
proper
reading.
it
places
too
much
emphasis
in
the
abstract
or
the
semantics.
it
ignores
the
practical
reality
which
we
feel
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
use
of
the
phrase
“knowingly
violates
regulations”
in
this
case
is
simply
a
shorthand.
in
fact,
there
are
some
cases
in
which
congress
has
on
a
rare
occasion
indicated
that
an
ignorance
of
a
regulation
or
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
a
regulation
will
be
an
excuse.
it
will
be
an
affirmative
defense
and
it
stated
that
quite
plainly
in
the
statute
in
language
quite
different
from
the
language
here
which
decided
two
similar
cases
in
footnote
11
of
our
brief
on
page
16.
now,
turning
specifically
to
the
judicial
and
legislative
consideration
of
the
statute,
our
second
point
is
that
this
court’s
decision
in
the
boyce
case
should
involve
the
same
statute.
it
does
not
require
the
government
to
prove
knowledge
of
the
regulations.
the
boyce
decision
didn’t
hold
that,
it
really
didn’t
reach
that
issue.
it
didn’t
specifically
address
itself
to
it.
the
court
there
assumed
as
did
the
parties
that
the
shipper,
it
was
a
carrier
on
that
case,
knew
the
regulations
and
proceeded
to
examine
factual
circumstances
not
the
question
of
knowledge
of
the
law.
the
issue
in
boyce
was
whether
a
regulation
was
vague
and
the
regulation
involved
dealt
with
the
routing
of
trucks
through
congested
areas
and
it
required
that
the
trucks
be
routed
this
so
far
as
practicable,
that
was
the
key
language
in
that
case
as
far
as
the
vagueness
is
concerned,
as
far
as
practicable
to
avoid
congested
areas
such
as
towns
and
the
defendant
in
that
case
had
routed
its
trucks
to
the
holland
town
in
new
york.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
with
rather
three
counts
of
an
indictment
there,
on
ground
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
this
court
affirmed.
and
in
affirming
the
decision,
this
court
indicated
that
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
required
“knowingly”
to
violate
the
regulations
was
crucial
and
it
stated
what
it
meant
by
that
requirement,
in
a
passage
that
we’ve
set
forth
on
page
10
of
our
brief.
it
said
the
government
must
prove
not
only
that
there
was
in
fact
a
preferable
route
but
also
that
the
defendant
knew
of
such
route
and
nevertheless
took
a
more
dangerous
one.
or
alternatively
that
the
defendant
willfully
neglected
to
inquire
whether
there
was
such
a
route.
the
comparable
requirement
to
that
proof
in
this
case,
we
submit
is
that
not
only
did
the
defendant
shipped
a
dangerous
commodity
without
stating
its
nature
on
the
shipping
papers
but
also
that
it
knew
what
he
was
doing
or
alternatively
that
he
willfully
neglected
to
ascertain
what
the
facts
were.
there
was
nothing
in
boyce
and
we
submit
there's
nothing
here
to
suggest
that
knowledge
of
the
law
was
also
an
element
of
the
government’s
proof
and
regulation
in
boyce
was
more
complex.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
defendant
as
the
court
suggested
in
boyce
might
very
well,
by
showing
a
good
faith
compliance
with
the
regulations,
by
showing
that
he
chose
a
route
and
he
tried
to
choose
the
safest
route
that
that
might
provide
a
defense
and
that
that
the
jury
in
that
case
might
equip
on
such
a
basis.
but
still
the
point
was
that
it
was
factual
circumstances
that
the
regulation
made
pertinent
and
not
the
knowledge
of
the
regulation
itself
that
was
critical.
and
we
don’t
suggest
here
that
a
showing
by
the
defendant
at
a
trial
that
he
didn’t
know
what
he
was
shipping
or
that
he
made
some
other
inadvertent
conduct
would
not
be
a
defense.
this
was
dismissal
of
an
information.
we
don’t
have
a
record.
we
don’t
know
what
the
defense
of
the
appellee
would
be.
we
submit
that
there
are
genuine
issues
which
in
some
cases
may
arise
and
that
those
should
properly
be
determined
at
a
trial.
finally,
we’d
like
briefly
to
turn
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
section.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
mixed
out.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
think
it
would
be
defense,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
a
claim
that
i
didn’t
know
what
i'm
was
shipping
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
question
for
the
jury
as
to
whether
to
believe
that.
these
cases
usually
are
based
on
largely
on
documentary
evidence,
so
you’d
have
the
shipping
paper
and
you,
be
able
to
see
what
he
put
on
the
shipping
paper
and
you’ll
be
able
to
see
what
he
put
on
the
shipping
paper.
and
he’d
have
a
very
strong
case
if
he
had
olive
oil
written
on
the
shipping
paper
that’s
what
he
thought
it
was.
it
would
be
a
hard
case
for
us
to
prove,
we
might
very
well
not
indict
in
such
a
situation.
i
was
advised
that
very
recently
there
was
a
case
where
the
government
decided
not
to
prosecute
and
which
an
employee
had
gotten
the
wrong
number
on
the
truck.
he’d
hitched
his
cab
up
to
1191
instead
of
1157
something
like
that
the
government
decided
that
it
wouldn’t
be
indicted.
situations
like
that
might
very
well
provide
offenses
of
trial.
but
we
don’t
believe
that
that
has
anything
to
bear
on
the
nature
of
the
elements
that
the
government
must
allege
in
the
indictment.
there
isn’t
any
legislative
history
of
the
very
early
provisions
stating
back
to
around
1908
regarding
what
congress
meant
by
using
“knowingly”
in
the
statute.
in
1960,
however,
when
congress
made
other
changes
in
the
statute,
it
did
consider
changing
the
“knowingly”
requirement.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
wanted
to
make
this
a
statute
imposing
absolute
liability.
in
other
words,
that
defense
of
“i
thought
i
was
shipping
olive
oil”
would
not
be
of
the
defense
that
the
shipper
would
be
absolutely
liable
for
what
was
in
that
truck
regardless
of
what
he
thought
it
was.
this
was
suggested
to
both
the
senate
and
the
house.
they
both
rejected
that
position.
what
the
senate
did
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate
which
would
have
taken
“knowingly”
out
of
the
statute
and
substituted
for
a
phrase,
“whoever
being
aware
that
the
icc
had
formulated
regulations
for
safe
transportation
of
explosives
and
other
dangerous
articles.”
the
house
then
deleted
that
phrase
and
put
“knowingly”
back
in
and
it
said
in
its
report
that
it
intended
to
retain
the
present
law.
it
made
reference
to
judicial
pronouncements
as
to
the
standards
of
conduct
under
the
law.
it
didn’t
say,
what
cases
it
was
referring
to
and
it
didn’t
say
what
its
interpretation
of
those
judicial
pronouncements
was.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that’s
true.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
there
was.
the
justification,
which
the
icc
had
submitted,
and
which
was
used
by
the
senate
in
its
proposal
had
made
reference
to
that
that
was
a
source
of
concern
as
we
believe
from
reading
the
cases,
boyce
as
well
as
st.
johnsbury
which
was
really
the
other
leading
case.
judge
magruder’s
opinion
was
the
only
one
which
really
addressed
itself
to
the
point
that
i
referred
to
earlier
whether
“knowing
violation
of
the
regulations”
meant
you
had
known
the
regulation.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
the
boyce
case
had
been
decided
and
so
had
st.
johnsbury
and
as
we've
argued
that
we
don’t
believe
the
boyce
case
reached
the
point
of
the
deciding
whether
knowledge
of
the
law
was
an
excuse.
we
believe
the
most
consistent
reading
of
that
case,
the
best
reading
of
that
case
is
that
it
assumed
and
it
presumed
that
the
shipper
would
have
that
knowledge
and
that
lack
of
that
knowledge
would
not
be
a
defense.
the
st.
johnsbury
case
in
the
concurring
opinion
as
i've
said,
judge
magruder
did
indicate
that
knowledge
of
the
regulations
would
be

lack
of
knowledge
with
the
regulations
would
be
a
defense
or
that
the
regulations
would
have
to
be
proved.
but
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case,
even
though
in
the
legislative
history
in
some
statements
by
interested
agencies.
it
was
interpreted
to
hold
that
knowledge
of
the
law
had
to
be
alleged
by
the
government.
the
opinion
is
not
that
clear,
the
facts
in
the
case.
it
was
a
case
very
similar
to
this
one.
it
involved
the
shipping
paper
requirement
which
at
that
time
required
the
shipper
to
attach
or
designate
a
label
which
would
be
then
put
on
the
dangerous
commodity
on
the
shipping
paper
and
the
proof
at
trial
according
to
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
was
that
the
rating
clerk
who
is
the
only
person
in
the
operation
responsible
for
this
either
negligently
failed
to
do
it
or
else
clipped
it
on
with
a
paper
clip
and
the
paper
clip
fell
off
and
the
papers
got
separated
as
a
result
of
that,
the
shipping
papers
didn’t
show
the
classification
and
the
truck
wasn’t
properly
placarded.
the
court
discussed
the
boyce
opinion
and
it
made
some
general
references
with
respect
to
the
knowledge
of
the
law
but
the
critical
holding
in
which
it
sort
of
paraphrased
boyce
was
that
the
government
must
prove
that
the
defendant,
i'm
quoting
from
the
case
now,
“aware
of
the
dangerous
nature
of
the
commodity
deliberately
chose
to
transport
it
without
placarding
its
trucks
or
labeling
it
shipping
papers
or
that
the
defendant
willfully
neglected
to
take
proper
precautions.”
now,
that’s
what
we
feel
we've
alleged
here.
that’s
what
we
believe
we
can
prove
at
trial.
our
point
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
revision
of
the
1960
act
as
we
stated
essentially
in
our
reply
brief
is
basically
that
it’s
neutral.
it
just
doesn’t
tell
us
enough
one
way
or
another
as
to
what
congress
intended
and
in
that
context,
we
feel
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
impute
the
congress
and
intent
to
bring
about
an
exemption
to
the
fundamental
principle
which
at
least
by
extension
would
apply
to
make
any
statute
which
says,
“knowingly
violates
regulations.”
one
in
which
the
government
must
prove
that
people
who
are
engaging
in
the
forbidding
conduct,
often
people
in
the
business,
know
the
regulations.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
not
as
such
--
its
carrier
and
ships
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that’s
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that
that’s
correct.
as
far
as
--
so
we've
--
in
that
sense
we
would
have
to
rely
as
far
as
justifying
the
presumption
of
knowledge
of
the
law
on
general
principles
and
on
the
fact
that
these
are
dangerous
commodities
which
ought
to
signal
to
somebody
the
fact
that
they
maybe
regulated
and
would
justify
the
government
imposing
upon
a
requirement
of
charging
them
with
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
precisely
and
is
bound
to
know
the
regulations
regarding
transport
of
a
dangerous
substance
so
that
if
it
fails
to
follow
those
regulations
knowingly,
it
can
be
convicted
under
the
statute
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
this
court
should
find
that
the
information
did
sufficiently
alleged
all
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime
in
this
case
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
a
trial.
i
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
only
have
about
two
brief
points.
first
with
respect
to
this
language,
the
point
is
that
it’s
a
standard
terminology
which
is
used
in
numerous
statutes.
we've
cited
the
statutes
at
footnote
7
of
our
brief
which
deal
with
the
federal
power
commission
and
federal
communications
commission,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
his
jurisdiction
over
conservation
and
there
are
numerous
other
areas.
and
although
we
are
willing
to
agree
that
there
maybe
a
certain
ambiguity
by
use
of
the
phrase
“knowingly
violates
regulations.”
if
you
read
it
in
the
abstract,
the
fact
that
it’s
used
so
frequently
means
to
us,
that
it
is
merely
a
means
by
which
congress
has
adopted
a
shorthand
to
incorporate
regulations
that
are
validly
promulgated
by
an
administrative
agency
with
respect
to
sections
822
and
823
of
this
act,
that
those
are
situations
in
which
congress
was
able
or
apparently
felt
itself
able
to
put
in
part
of
the
conduct
in
the
statute
itself
rather
than
delegating
full
responsibility.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
that
was
the
second
point,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
it
just
isn’t
clear
enough
as
to
what
congress
meant
when
it
revised
the
statute
that
we
can’t
get
enough
guidance
with
respect
to
what
the
congress
intended
to
impute
to
them
and
intent
to
override
what
we
consider
to
be
a
fundamental
proposition
that
that
ignorance
of
the
law
doesn’t
excuse
its
violation.
the
interstate
commerce
commission’s
justification
which
mr.
spencer
referred
to,
which
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
his
brief,
referred
to
the
commission’s
view
that
reference
to
culpable
intent
had
been
relied
upon
by
defense
attorneys
and
to
some
extent
by
courts
as
requiring
establishment
of
some
minimal
element
or
affirmative
intention
to
evade
the
law
in
addition
to
the
knowledge
of
the
facts.
this
we
think
emphasizes
that
even
the
interstate
commerce
commission
wasn’t
absolutely
clear
on
that.
it
felt
that
there
was
difficulty
and
it
wanted
to
create
absolute
liability.
i
submit
that
the
absolute
liability
would
have
been
much
more
helpful
to
it
in
terms
of
eliminating
knowledge
of
the
facts.
in
other
words,
eliminating
the
requirement
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
he
was
shipping
sulfuric
acid
for
example,
and
we
think
that
by
the
same
token,
it’s
possible
to
read
the
language
that
the
senate
substituted.
whoever
is
being
aware
that
regulations
had
been
formulated
as
referring
somewhat
ironically
perhaps
to
knowledge
of
the
law
but
not
knowledge
of
the
facts.
in
other
words,
you’d
have
a
situation
where
the
government
would
at
trial
have
to
prove
a
general
awareness
by
the
shipper
or
carrier
of
knowledge
of
the
regulations
but
no
knowledge
at
all,
absolute
liability
with
respect
to
the
facts.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
third
point
and
that
is
we
don’t
intend
to
say
here
that
there
isn’t
a
defense
of
a
mistake
of
fact.
i
think
that’s
for
the
jury,
however,
proof
necessarily
in
these
cases
depends
to
a
large
extent
on
inferring
from
conduct,
knowledge
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
regulations.
for
example
in
this
case,
we've
alleged
five
counts
in
the
indictment.
we
would
proffer
a
trial,
33
other
counts
and
we
would
ask
the
jury
to
infer
from
that
knowledge
of
the
facts.
and
in
that
sense,
an
intent,
a
culpable
intent
if
you
will,
to
violate
the
regulations
and
no
further
questions.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
five-count
information
alleging
violations
of
section
834
of
title
18
which
deals
with
the
transportation
of
explosives
and
other
dangerous
substances.
section
834
which
we
have
set
forth
in
part
on
page
3
of
our
brief
provides
that
“whoever
knowingly
violates
regulations
formulated
for
the
safe
transportation
of
hazardous
materials
shall
be
fined
up
to
$1,000.00
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
a
year.”
the
information
in
this
case
charge
the
appellee
which
is
a
corporation
engaged
primarily
in
the
manufacturing
and
shipping
of
chemicals
and
fertilizers
with
violations
of
a
regulation,
which
we’ve
also
set
forth
on
page
3,
dealing
with
the
contents
of
shipping
papers.
the
regulation
requires
that
the
shipper
state
on
a
shipping
paper
designated
names
and
classifications
of
substances
which
he
is
shipping.
in
this
case,
for
example
the
shipper
was
shipping
sulfuric
acid
and
the
regulations
required
him
to
state
sulfuric
acid
on
the
shipping
paper
which
is
the
name
and
corrosive
liquid,
which
is
the
classification.
and
this
safety
requirement
serves
essentially
two
purposes.
first,
it
indicates
to
the
carrier
what
kind
of
labels
he
should
put
on
the
packages
and
what
kind
of
placards
he
should
put
on
his
truck.
and
secondly,
the
shipping
paper
itself
which
is
kept
in
cab
of
the
truck
with
the
driver
enables
the
driver
or
anybody
else
who
might
be
involved
in
an
emergency
such
as
an
accident
or
a
fire
to
quickly
identify
what
the
substance
is
and
to
take
whatever
appropriate
steps
such
clearing
an
area
might
be
necessary.
the
five
counts
in
this
information
each
alleged
similar
conduct.
three
of
them
alleged
a
knowing
failure
to
state
the
required
classification
and
as
corrosive
liquid
on
the
shipping
papers.
and
two,
alleged
knowing
failure
to
state
both
the
required
classification
and
the
required
name
of
the
substance
being
shipped.
the
district
court
granted
the
appellee’s
motion
to
dismiss
this
information
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
state
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
and
that
essential
element
in
the
court’s
language
was
knowledge
of
violating
the
regulation.
as
we
read
that
ruling,
the
district
court
held
that
the
government
has
to
allege
and
prove
not
only
that
the
appellee
knew
it
was
shipping
a
dangerous
article
without
stating
its
proper
name
and
classification
on
the
shipping
papers,
which
we
alleged
in
the
information
but
also
that
it
knew
the
terms
of
the
regulation
forbidding
that
conduct
and
specifically
intended
to
violate
that
regulation
or
as
the
district
court
put
it,
an
added
ingredient
of
consciousness
that
it’s
illegal
not
to
do
the
act.
so,
the
question
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
yes,
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
gather
it
was,
i
didn’t
know.
the
question
in
the
case
then
is
the
simple
one
and
it’s
whether
a
defendant
can
be
convicted
under
this
statute
for
intentionally
engaging
in
conduct
that
is
prohibited
even
though
he
doesn’t
know
that
the
law
prohibits
it.
we
believe
that
a
shipper
or
carrier
can
be
convicted
under
these
circumstances.
our
position
is
simply
that
proof
of
knowledge
of
pertinent
the
facts
is
what
is
essential
and
proof
of
knowledge
of
law
is
not
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
know
the
regulations
governing
transportation
of
dangerous
articles.
now,
he's
charge
with
that
knowledge
under
the
fundamental
principle
that
ignorance
of
the
law
does
not
excuse
its
violations
by
one
who
intentionally
engages
in
conduct
which
the
law
forbids.
charging
shippers
and
carriers
of
dangerous
substances
with
knowledge
of
regulations
regarding
their
transport
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
to
do.
in
the
first
place,
the
substances
are
dangerous
and
that
alone
ought
to
signal,
the
possibility
of
existence
of
a
regulatory
scheme
regarding
the
transportation.
so
this
case
in
that
sense
is
similar
to
united
states
against
freed
which
this
court
decided
this
month.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
ruled
that
specific
intent
for
knowledge
that
gun
were
unregistered
was
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
of
possession
of
an
unregistered
firearm.
in
effect,
that
the
rule
that
the
individual
could
be
presumed
to
know
or
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
registration
requirement.
in
this
case
and
in
numerous
regulatory
areas,
there's
another
factor
which
makes
it
particularly
appropriate
to
charge
the
people
engaged
in
forbidden
conduct
with
knowledge
of
the
regulations
and
that
is
that
this
appellee
and
most
of
the
people
who
are
brought
under
a
prosecution
under
this
statute
are
in
the
business
of
shipping
dangerous
substances.
so,
our
fundamental
position
is
that
there
is
no
basis
in
this
case
for
making
an
exception
to
the
principle
that
ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
excuse.
we’d
like
to
emphasize
three
points
in
that
connection.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
effect
of
this
court’s
decision
in
boyce
motor
lines
against
the
united
states,
some
20
years
ago
in
342
u.s.,
and
the
history
of
the
statute.
the
first
point
deals
with
the
language,
the
statute
says,
“knowingly
violates
regulations.”
this
is
a
typical
regulatory
pattern
in
numerous
areas
where
congress
simply
can’t
fill
out
the
details
of
the
statute.
it
sets
forth
the
general
prohibition
and
leaves
to
the
administrative
agency
the
responsibility
for
filling
in
the
details
and
designating
the
specific
conduct
that’s
forbidden.
and
this
language
“knowingly
violates
regulations”
is
standard
terminology.
it’s
used
in
numerous
statutes
we've
cited,
some
of
them
in
footnote
7
of
our
brief
at
page
13.
we
submit
that
if
congress
in
these
various
regulatory
areas
had
set
forth
the
prohibited
conduct
in
the
statute
itself,
there
wouldn’t
be
any
question
but
that
the
government’s
only
obligation
would
be
to
prove
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
not
knowledge
of
the
law.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
congress
had
written
a
statute
that
says,
“whoever
knowingly
ships
sulfuric
acid
without
stating
on
the
shipping
papers
that
it
is
sulfuric
acid
and
that
it
is
a
corrosive
liquid
shall
be
punished.”
we
submit
in
that
situation
there
wouldn’t
be
any
question
that
our
burden
of
proof
would
be
what
we've
alleged
in
the
information
here,
knowing
conduct.
similarly,
if
congress
had
written
as
is
it
would
have
had
to
in
a
regulatory
statute
or
as
it
likely
would
and
as
it
has
in
cases
where
it
has
set
forth
conduct
that
is
prohibited
in
the
statute
itself,
set
forth
a
number
of
different
kinds
of
conduct
and
then
had
one
provision
that
says,
“whoever
knowingly
violates
the
statute
or
the
statutory
provisions
shall
be
punished.”
we
submit
the
same
result
would
obtain
that
we
would
have
to
prove
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
not
knowledge
of
the
law.
we
don’t
think
the
results
shall
be
any
different
because
congress
has
adopted
a
convenient
shorthand
in
this
case
as
a
means
of
delegating
responsibility
to
the
administrative
agency.
in
this
case,
the
department
of
transportation
and
for
incorporating
all
the
various
prohibitions
that
are
involved.
we
realize
it’s
possible
to
read
the
language
“knowingly
violate
regulations”
to
suggest
that
you
have
to
know
what
the
regulation
is.
but
we
think
that
the
position
which
evidently
is
the
appellee’s
position
and
which
was
the
position
stated
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
judge
magruder
in
the
st.
johnsbury
trucking
case
which
was
a
leading
early
court
of
appeals
decision
on
this
matter,
that
the
use
of
that
language
justifies
a
distinction
.we
don’t
believe
that
that’s
a
proper
reading.
it
places
too
much
emphasis
in
the
abstract
or
the
semantics.
it
ignores
the
practical
reality
which
we
feel
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
use
of
the
phrase
“knowingly
violates
regulations”
in
this
case
is
simply
a
shorthand.
in
fact,
there
are
some
cases
in
which
congress
has
on
a
rare
occasion
indicated
that
an
ignorance
of
a
regulation
or
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
a
regulation
will
be
an
excuse.
it
will
be
an
affirmative
defense
and
it
stated
that
quite
plainly
in
the
statute
in
language
quite
different
from
the
language
here
which
decided
two
similar
cases
in
footnote
11
of
our
brief
on
page
16.
now,
turning
specifically
to
the
judicial
and
legislative
consideration
of
the
statute,
our
second
point
is
that
this
court’s
decision
in
the
boyce
case
should
involve
the
same
statute.
it
does
not
require
the
government
to
prove
knowledge
of
the
regulations.
the
boyce
decision
didn’t
hold
that,
it
really
didn’t
reach
that
issue.
it
didn’t
specifically
address
itself
to
it.
the
court
there
assumed
as
did
the
parties
that
the
shipper,
it
was
a
carrier
on
that
case,
knew
the
regulations
and
proceeded
to
examine
factual
circumstances
not
the
question
of
knowledge
of
the
law.
the
issue
in
boyce
was
whether
a
regulation
was
vague
and
the
regulation
involved
dealt
with
the
routing
of
trucks
through
congested
areas
and
it
required
that
the
trucks
be
routed
this
so
far
as
practicable,
that
was
the
key
language
in
that
case
as
far
as
the
vagueness
is
concerned,
as
far
as
practicable
to
avoid
congested
areas
such
as
towns
and
the
defendant
in
that
case
had
routed
its
trucks
to
the
holland
town
in
new
york.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
with
rather
three
counts
of
an
indictment
there,
on
ground
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
this
court
affirmed.
and
in
affirming
the
decision,
this
court
indicated
that
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
required
“knowingly”
to
violate
the
regulations
was
crucial
and
it
stated
what
it
meant
by
that
requirement,
in
a
passage
that
we’ve
set
forth
on
page
10
of
our
brief.
it
said
the
government
must
prove
not
only
that
there
was
in
fact
a
preferable
route
but
also
that
the
defendant
knew
of
such
route
and
nevertheless
took
a
more
dangerous
one.
or
alternatively
that
the
defendant
willfully
neglected
to
inquire
whether
there
was
such
a
route.
the
comparable
requirement
to
that
proof
in
this
case,
we
submit
is
that
not
only
did
the
defendant
shipped
a
dangerous
commodity
without
stating
its
nature
on
the
shipping
papers
but
also
that
it
knew
what
he
was
doing
or
alternatively
that
he
willfully
neglected
to
ascertain
what
the
facts
were.
there
was
nothing
in
boyce
and
we
submit
there's
nothing
here
to
suggest
that
knowledge
of
the
law
was
also
an
element
of
the
government’s
proof
and
regulation
in
boyce
was
more
complex.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
defendant
as
the
court
suggested
in
boyce
might
very
well,
by
showing
a
good
faith
compliance
with
the
regulations,
by
showing
that
he
chose
a
route
and
he
tried
to
choose
the
safest
route
that
that
might
provide
a
defense
and
that
that
the
jury
in
that
case
might
equip
on
such
a
basis.
but
still
the
point
was
that
it
was
factual
circumstances
that
the
regulation
made
pertinent
and
not
the
knowledge
of
the
regulation
itself
that
was
critical.
and
we
don’t
suggest
here
that
a
showing
by
the
defendant
at
a
trial
that
he
didn’t
know
what
he
was
shipping
or
that
he
made
some
other
inadvertent
conduct
would
not
be
a
defense.
this
was
dismissal
of
an
information.
we
don’t
have
a
record.
we
don’t
know
what
the
defense
of
the
appellee
would
be.
we
submit
that
there
are
genuine
issues
which
in
some
cases
may
arise
and
that
those
should
properly
be
determined
at
a
trial.
finally,
we’d
like
briefly
to
turn
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
section.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
mixed
out.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
think
it
would
be
defense,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
a
claim
that
i
didn’t
know
what
i'm
was
shipping
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
question
for
the
jury
as
to
whether
to
believe
that.
these
cases
usually
are
based
on
largely
on
documentary
evidence,
so
you’d
have
the
shipping
paper
and
you,
be
able
to
see
what
he
put
on
the
shipping
paper
and
you’ll
be
able
to
see
what
he
put
on
the
shipping
paper.
and
he’d
have
a
very
strong
case
if
he
had
olive
oil
written
on
the
shipping
paper
that’s
what
he
thought
it
was.
it
would
be
a
hard
case
for
us
to
prove,
we
might
very
well
not
indict
in
such
a
situation.
i
was
advised
that
very
recently
there
was
a
case
where
the
government
decided
not
to
prosecute
and
which
an
employee
had
gotten
the
wrong
number
on
the
truck.
he’d
hitched
his
cab
up
to
1191
instead
of
1157
something
like
that
the
government
decided
that
it
wouldn’t
be
indicted.
situations
like
that
might
very
well
provide
offenses
of
trial.
but
we
don’t
believe
that
that
has
anything
to
bear
on
the
nature
of
the
elements
that
the
government
must
allege
in
the
indictment.
there
isn’t
any
legislative
history
of
the
very
early
provisions
stating
back
to
around
1908
regarding
what
congress
meant
by
using
“knowingly”
in
the
statute.
in
1960,
however,
when
congress
made
other
changes
in
the
statute,
it
did
consider
changing
the
“knowingly”
requirement.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
wanted
to
make
this
a
statute
imposing
absolute
liability.
in
other
words,
that
defense
of
“i
thought
i
was
shipping
olive
oil”
would
not
be
of
the
defense
that
the
shipper
would
be
absolutely
liable
for
what
was
in
that
truck
regardless
of
what
he
thought
it
was.
this
was
suggested
to
both
the
senate
and
the
house.
they
both
rejected
that
position.
what
the
senate
did
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate
which
would
have
taken
“knowingly”
out
of
the
statute
and
substituted
for
a
phrase,
“whoever
being
aware
that
the
icc
had
formulated
regulations
for
safe
transportation
of
explosives
and
other
dangerous
articles.”
the
house
then
deleted
that
phrase
and
put
“knowingly”
back
in
and
it
said
in
its
report
that
it
intended
to
retain
the
present
law.
it
made
reference
to
judicial
pronouncements
as
to
the
standards
of
conduct
under
the
law.
it
didn’t
say,
what
cases
it
was
referring
to
and
it
didn’t
say
what
its
interpretation
of
those
judicial
pronouncements
was.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that’s
true.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
there
was.
the
justification,
which
the
icc
had
submitted,
and
which
was
used
by
the
senate
in
its
proposal
had
made
reference
to
that
that
was
a
source
of
concern
as
we
believe
from
reading
the
cases,
boyce
as
well
as
st.
johnsbury
which
was
really
the
other
leading
case.
judge
magruder’s
opinion
was
the
only
one
which
really
addressed
itself
to
the
point
that
i
referred
to
earlier
whether
“knowing
violation
of
the
regulations”
meant
you
had
known
the
regulation.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
the
boyce
case
had
been
decided
and
so
had
st.
johnsbury
and
as
we've
argued
that
we
don’t
believe
the
boyce
case
reached
the
point
of
the
deciding
whether
knowledge
of
the
law
was
an
excuse.
we
believe
the
most
consistent
reading
of
that
case,
the
best
reading
of
that
case
is
that
it
assumed
and
it
presumed
that
the
shipper
would
have
that
knowledge
and
that
lack
of
that
knowledge
would
not
be
a
defense.
the
st.
johnsbury
case
in
the
concurring
opinion
as
i've
said,
judge
magruder
did
indicate
that
knowledge
of
the
regulations
would
be
a
--
lack
of
knowledge
with
the
regulations
would
be
a
defense
or
that
the
regulations
would
have
to
be
proved.
but
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case,
even
though
in
the
legislative
history
in
some
statements
by
interested
agencies.
it
was
interpreted
to
hold
that
knowledge
of
the
law
had
to
be
alleged
by
the
government.
the
opinion
is
not
that
clear,
the
facts
in
the
case.
it
was
a
case
very
similar
to
this
one.
it
involved
the
shipping
paper
requirement
which
at
that
time
required
the
shipper
to
attach
or
designate
a
label
which
would
be
then
put
on
the
dangerous
commodity
on
the
shipping
paper
and
the
proof
at
trial
according
to
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
was
that
the
rating
clerk
who
is
the
only
person
in
the
operation
responsible
for
this
either
negligently
failed
to
do
it
or
else
clipped
it
on
with
a
paper
clip
and
the
paper
clip
fell
off
and
the
papers
got
separated
as
a
result
of
that,
the
shipping
papers
didn’t
show
the
classification
and
the
truck
wasn’t
properly
placarded.
the
court
discussed
the
boyce
opinion
and
it
made
some
general
references
with
respect
to
the
knowledge
of
the
law
but
the
critical
holding
in
which
it
sort
of
paraphrased
boyce
was
that
the
government
must
prove
that
the
defendant,
i'm
quoting
from
the
case
now,
“aware
of
the
dangerous
nature
of
the
commodity
deliberately
chose
to
transport
it
without
placarding
its
trucks
or
labeling
it
shipping
papers
or
that
the
defendant
willfully
neglected
to
take
proper
precautions.”
now,
that’s
what
we
feel
we've
alleged
here.
that’s
what
we
believe
we
can
prove
at
trial.
our
point
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
revision
of
the
1960
act
as
we
stated
essentially
in
our
reply
brief
is
basically
that
it’s
neutral.
it
just
doesn’t
tell
us
enough
one
way
or
another
as
to
what
congress
intended
and
in
that
context,
we
feel
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
impute
the
congress
and
intent
to
bring
about
an
exemption
to
the
fundamental
principle
which
at
least
by
extension
would
apply
to
make
any
statute
which
says,
“knowingly
violates
regulations.”
one
in
which
the
government
must
prove
that
people
who
are
engaging
in
the
forbidding
conduct,
often
people
in
the
business,
know
the
regulations.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
not
as
such
--
its
carrier
and
ships
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that’s
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
that
that’s
correct.
as
far
as
--
so
we've
--
in
that
sense
we
would
have
to
rely
as
far
as
justifying
the
presumption
of
knowledge
of
the
law
on
general
principles
and
on
the
fact
that
these
are
dangerous
commodities
which
ought
to
signal
to
somebody
the
fact
that
they
maybe
regulated
and
would
justify
the
government
imposing
upon
a
requirement
of
charging
them
with
--
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
precisely
and
is
bound
to
know
the
regulations
regarding
transport
of
a
dangerous
substance
so
that
if
it
fails
to
follow
those
regulations
knowingly,
it
can
be
convicted
under
the
statute
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
this
court
should
find
that
the
information
did
sufficiently
alleged
all
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime
in
this
case
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
a
trial.
i
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
i
only
have
about
two
brief
points.
first
with
respect
to
this
language,
the
point
is
that
it’s
a
standard
terminology
which
is
used
in
numerous
statutes.
we've
cited
the
statutes
at
footnote
7
of
our
brief
which
deal
with
the
federal
power
commission
and
federal
communications
commission,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
his
jurisdiction
over
conservation
and
there
are
numerous
other
areas.
and
although
we
are
willing
to
agree
that
there
maybe
a
certain
ambiguity
by
use
of
the
phrase
“knowingly
violates
regulations.”
if
you
read
it
in
the
abstract,
the
fact
that
it’s
used
so
frequently
means
to
us,
that
it
is
merely
a
means
by
which
congress
has
adopted
a
shorthand
to
incorporate
regulations
that
are
validly
promulgated
by
an
administrative
agency
with
respect
to
sections
822
and
823
of
this
act,
that
those
are
situations
in
which
congress
was
able
or
apparently
felt
itself
able
to
put
in
part
of
the
conduct
in
the
statute
itself
rather
than
delegating
full
responsibility.
mr.
john
f.
dienelt
well,
that
was
the
second
point,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
it
just
isn’t
clear
enough
as
to
what
congress
meant
when
it
revised
the
statute
that
we
can’t
get
enough
guidance
with
respect
to
what
the
congress
intended
to
impute
to
them
and
intent
to
override
what
we
consider
to
be
a
fundamental
proposition
that
that
ignorance
of
the
law
doesn’t
excuse
its
violation.
the
interstate
commerce
commission’s
justification
which
mr.
spencer
referred
to,
which
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
his
brief,
referred
to
the
commission’s
view
that
reference
to
culpable
intent
had
been
relied
upon
by
defense
attorneys
and
to
some
extent
by
courts
as
requiring
establishment
of
some
minimal
element
or
affirmative
intention
to
evade
the
law
in
addition
to
the
knowledge
of
the
facts.
this
we
think
emphasizes
that
even
the
interstate
commerce
commission
wasn’t
absolutely
clear
on
that.
it
felt
that
there
was
difficulty
and
it
wanted
to
create
absolute
liability.
i
submit
that
the
absolute
liability
would
have
been
much
more
helpful
to
it
in
terms
of
eliminating
knowledge
of
the
facts.
in
other
words,
eliminating
the
requirement
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
he
was
shipping
sulfuric
acid
for
example,
and
we
think
that
by
the
same
token,
it’s
possible
to
read
the
language
that
the
senate
substituted.
whoever
is
being
aware
that
regulations
had
been
formulated
as
referring
somewhat
ironically
perhaps
to
knowledge
of
the
law
but
not
knowledge
of
the
facts.
in
other
words,
you’d
have
a
situation
where
the
government
would
at
trial
have
to
prove
a
general
awareness
by
the
shipper
or
carrier
of
knowledge
of
the
regulations
but
no
knowledge
at
all,
absolute
liability
with
respect
to
the
facts.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
third
point
and
that
is
we
don’t
intend
to
say
here
that
there
isn’t
a
defense
of
a
mistake
of
fact.
i
think
that’s
for
the
jury,
however,
proof
necessarily
in
these
cases
depends
to
a
large
extent
on
inferring
from
conduct,
knowledge
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
regulations.
for
example
in
this
case,
we've
alleged
five
counts
in
the
indictment.
we
would
proffer
a
trial,
33
other
counts
and
we
would
ask
the
jury
to
infer
from
that
knowledge
of
the
facts.
and
in
that
sense,
an
intent,
a
culpable
intent
if
you
will,
to
violate
the
regulations
and
no
further
questions.
