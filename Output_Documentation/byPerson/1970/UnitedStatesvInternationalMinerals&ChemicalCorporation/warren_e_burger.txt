mr.

you
may

whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
hypothetical
question.
suppose
by
some
coincidence
the
man
engaged
in
a
manufacturing
and
handling
of
sulfuric
acid
also
had
a
division
that
handled
olive
oil
and
by
sheer
inadvertence
of
employees
got
the
sulfuric
acid
in
the
olive
oil
tanks
and
tank
cars
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
impact
would
that
have
on
a
criminal
charge
for
failing
to
label
the
sulfuric
acid
accurately?
would
it
be
a
defense
from
another
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
saying
is
that
anybody
in
sulfuric
acid
business
is
bound
to
know
that
it’s
a
dangerous
substance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
spencer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
arguments
of
necessity
assumes
that
you
have
to
be
in
the
sulfuric
acid
business
and
not
know
that
it’s
a
such
dangerous
substance
that
it’s
regulated
by
a
lot
of
statutes
and
rules
about
having,
doesn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
take
that
first
part.
isn’t
anybody
in
the
sulfuric
acid
business,
bound
to
know
its
chemical
properties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
take
this
one
step
at
a
time.
what's
the
answer
to
that
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn’t
he
provide
in
his
own
handling
of
it,
a
lot
of
very
special
kinds
of
containers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
what
the
government
is
complaining
about
here.
that
they
never
had
the
chance
to
get
into
the
proof,
even
though
the
charge
follows,
tracks
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
justice
white’s
observation
made
that
pretty
clear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
what
justice
holmes
and
judge
magruder
and
justice
jackson
had
to
say
on
the
same
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
they
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
suspend
for
lunch--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
spencer,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
take
that
position
mr.
spencer,
you're
now
getting
into
the
merits
of
what
the
jury
might
do
with
it,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
intent?
can’t
the
jury
find
intent
from
conduct
and
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
take
the
jury
for
example,
specifically
conclude
that
the
man
that’s
engaged
or
a
company
that’s
engaged
in
the
manufacturing
and
processing
of
sulfuric
acid
knows
that
it’s
an
inherently
dangerous
substance
and
infer
from
that,
all
the
necessary
elements
of
the
criminal
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
telling
us
mr.
spencer
that
834
(f)
has
no
impact
on
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.

in
--
this
charge
is
under
834
(f)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
languages
is
whoever
uses
knowingly
violates,
is
it
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
come
back
to
my
original
question
on
that.
why
isn’t
tat
a
matter
for
a
jury?
you

a
statute
here
which
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
these
languages
whoever
knowingly
violates
and
an
indictment
that
says
that
this

did
knowingly
failed

the
proper
names
sulfuric
acid?
chief

that
something
for

to
worry
about
now?
chief
