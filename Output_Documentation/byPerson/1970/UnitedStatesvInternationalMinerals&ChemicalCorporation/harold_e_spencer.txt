mr.
harold
e.
spencer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
to
state
an
offense
against
the
united
states
under
section
834
(f)
of
title
18.
our
position
with
respect
to
that
issue
can
be
very
briefly
stated
in
three
propositions.
first,
the
involved
statute
punishes
only
one
who
knowingly
violates
the
regulation;
second,
to
state
an
offense
under
the
statute,
the
defendant
must
be
charged
with
knowingly
violating
the
regulations;
and
third,
the
information
here
does
not
charge
the
defendant
with
knowingly
violating
the
regulation.
therefore,
the
court
properly
dismissed
the
information.
that
was
the
sole
reasoning
of
the
court
and
i
submit
that
its
reasoning
was
correct.
the
court
didn’t
go
any
further
than
that.
there's
been
no
trial,
no
evidence
submitted.
the
court
simply
dismissed
the
information.
the
first
proposition
as
i
submit
self
evident
from
the
wording
of
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
punish
an
unknowing
violation
whether
or
not
the
defendant
intended
to
do
the
act
that
he
did.
it
only
punishes
a
knowing
violation.
the
second
proposition
naturally
follows
from
the
first
one
and
i
don’t
believe
there
can
be
any
argument
about
that
under
the
well-known
rule
that
the
information
must
charge
all
the
essential
elements
of
defense.
it
must
charge
the
defendant
with
the
knowing
violation.
so,
we
come
to
the
crucial
question
which
is,
“did
the
information
charge
the
defendant
with
a
knowing
violation.”
well,
it
didn’t
do
so
in
expressed
terms.
the
charge
is
a
knowing
act
which
happens
to
be
in
violation
of
the
regulation.
but
that
is
not
the
offense
which
is
punishable
by
the
statute.
the
government
doesn’t
really
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that’s
correct.
the
charges
that
the
defendant
knowingly
did
enact
which
happens
to
be
in
violation
of
the
regulation
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
which
was
in
violation
of
the
regulation.
but
our
position
is
that
the
statutory
offense
and
the
only
offense
is
a
knowing
violation
of
the
regulation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
they
should
have
been
charged
that
the
defendant
knowingly
violated
the
regulation
by
doing
whatever
acts
they
alleged.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
makes
it
a
very
vital
difference,
your
honor.
the
reasons
which
i
will
state
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
the
statute
says,
“whoever
knowingly
violates
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
your
honor.
“whoever
knowingly
violates
them
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
say
--
i
say
he
must
be
charged
with
a
“knowing
violation”.
now,
i
don’t
come
to
the
question
of
proof.
i
don’t
come
to
the
question
yet,
of
what
proof
would
be
sufficient
to
show
a
knowing
violation.
my
only
point
here
and
the
only
point
involved
here
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
that’s
our
contention
that
he
must
be
charged
with
a
“knowing
violation
of
the
regulation.”
now,
the
government
argument
deals
with
the
meaning
of
the
term
knowingly.
they
have
a
long
argument
in
their
brief
about
the
scienter
requirements
of
the
word
“knowingly.”
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
if
there,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
if
their
right
that
the
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
that’s
correct.
if
that’s
all
the
statute
punishes
but
that
isn’t
what
the
statute
punishes.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that’s
what
the
argument
about,
yes.
now,
the
district
court
didn’t
ever
consider
any
of
the
questions,
as
i
say.
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
and
i
would
agree
that
what
constitutes
knowing
violations
should
only
be
decided
upon
a
trial
of
the
issues.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
not
necessarily,
it
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
but
that
has
--
that
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
violation
of
this
particular
regulation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
don’t
think
necessarily
that
he
is
bound
to
know
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
think
if
you
got
to
a
question
of
proof
that
that
would
certainly
be
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
he
negligently
failed
to
be
aware
of
the
regulations.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
well,
no
the
charge
does
not
track
the
statute,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
and
certainly
the
decision
in
the
st.
johnsbury
case
makes
it
clear.
the
necessary
implication
of
the
boyce
case
makes
it
clear,
mr.
justice
brennan’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
freed
case,
i
believe
it
was,
makes
it
clear
that
there's
a
distinction
between
the
terms.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
they
didn’t
address
themselves
to
that
subject.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no.
no,
your
honor
they
did
not.
they
--
the
question
--
the
government’s
argument
necessarily
comes
down
to
this
proposition
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
statute
which
says,
“whosoever
knowingly
does
an
act
in
violation
of
a
regulation
is
guilty
of
an
offense.”
and
the
statute
which
says,
“whosoever
knowingly
violates
a
regulation
is
guilty
of
an
offense.”
the
government
says,
“this
is
typical
language,
that
it’s
standard
language.
it
isn’t
typical
standard
at
all.”
the
language
in
834
is
different
from
what
congress
used
in
832
and
833
of
the
same
statute.
that
is
the
language
that
the
government
wants
and
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
made
that
distinction.
it
wrote
that
scienter
requirements
are
different
in
section
834
from
the
requirements
in
832
and
833.
and
it
certainly
knew
exactly
what
it
was
doing
when
it
did
that.
the
question
that
the
government
wants
to
do
is
that
they
want
to
take
the
word
knowingly
out
of
a
place
in
the
statute
where
congress
put
it
and
put
it
somewhere
else
which
completely
changes
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
government
--
it
isn’t
the
question
of
proving
it
--
i
think
the
government
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
the
statute
means
what
it
says
and
they
have
to
charge
it
“knowing
violation”,
they
probable
can’t
prove
it
in
this
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
i
also
have
the
three
points
that
mr.
dienelt
had
with
respect
to
the
argument.
the
meaning
of
the
words,
the
judicial
interpretations
and
the
legislative
intent,
as
i
have
pointed
out
that
this
is
not
a
typical
statute.
it
is
not
standard
terminology,
congress
itself
drew
the
distinction
between
the
meaning
of
the
word,
“knowingly”
as
they
used
it
section
834
and
as
they
used
it
in
sections
832
and
833.
in
the
boyce
motor
line
case,
this
court
said
that
that
statute
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
thank
you.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
just
finished
discussing
the
wording
of
the
statute.
before
getting
to
the
legislative
history,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
few
minutes
with
respect
to
the
boyce
case
and
the
st.
johnsbury
case.
in
the
boyce
motor
lines
case,
this
court
held
that
the
statute
in
question
punishes
only
those
who
“knowingly
violate
the
regulation.”
the
court
said
that
the
presence
of
a
culpable
intent
is
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense.
the
government
says
that
the
court
did
not
discuss
the
question
of
knowledge
which
is
true
because
that
question
was
not
involved
in
the
case.
however,
the
presence
of
the
culpable
intent
cannot
be
squared
with
the
wording
of
the
information
which
the
government
wants
to
use
in
this
case.
now,
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
only
to
the
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
think
--
oh
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
correct,
that
could.
that
is
a
question
for
the
trial
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
government
does
not
have
to
charge
the
offense
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
confine
its
proof
to
the
offense
set
forth
in
the
statute.
now
in
the
st.
johnsbury
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
first
circuit
reversed
the
district
court’s
finding
of
guilty
under
this
statute
and
said
that
the
court
had
erred
because
it
found
that
there
was
no
element
of
culpable
intent
necessary.
and
in
chief
judge
magruder’s
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
he
took
up
this
very
point
and
he
explained
the
difference
between
an
act
knowingly
done
and
which
happened
to
be
in
violation
of
the
regulation
and
a
knowing
violation
of
the
regulation.
and
he
made
that
very
clear
and
he
says,
“it
depends
upon
how
the
offense
is
defined
by
congress.”
he
says,
“that
this
makes
the
hard
for
the
government
to
prosecute
the
cases.
it’s
up
to
congress
to
fix
it
because
they
can
define
the
offense.”
now,
i
think
if
those
cases
are
not
the
answer
to
this.
the
legislative
history
for
the
1960
amendments
is
conclusive
because
the
commission
which
at
that
time
had
jurisdiction
over
these
regulations,
they’ve
since
been
transferred
to
the
department
of
transportation.
but
at
that
time,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
jurisdiction
and
they
took
judge
magruder’s
suggestion.
and
they
requested
in
the
85th
congress,
they
requested
the
passage
of
a
bill
making
various
amendments
to
this
act
and
among
that
was
an
amendment
to
delete
the
word
“knowingly”
from
what
was
then
section
835.
it’s
the
same
section
which
is
now
834.
the
senate
and
the
85th
congress
noted
that
the
deletion
of
the
word
“knowingly”
would
create
an
absolute
liability
for
violation
of
the
section
and
the
senate
said,
“we
don’t
want
to
go
that
far.”
so,
they
substituted
the
language
reading
as
follows,
“any
person
who
being
aware
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
formulated
regulations
for
the
safe
transportation
of
explosives
and
other
dangerous
articles,
now
i'm
paraphrasing,
would
be
guilty
of
an
offense
if
there
was
a
noncompliance
with
the
regulations.”
that
bill
passed
the
senate,
i
believe,
but
failed
to
pass
the
house.
in
the
86th
congress,
the
commission
resubmitted
the
draft
bill
and
in
this
case
they
took
the
senate’s
language.
they
submitted
the
statement
of
justification
in
favor
of
the
proposed
amendment,
a
portion
of
which
we
have
printed
in
the
appendix.
that
position
--
the
position
of
the
commission
was
that
the
word,
“knowingly”
should
be
simply
deleted
from
the
statute.
but
in
view
of
the
amendments
which
a
senate
language
had
made
in
the
85th
congress,
the
commission
now
took
the
senate
language
and
said,
“this
is
preferable
to
what
we
have.”
now,
in
the
statement
of
justification,
the
principle
reason
that
they
used
was
the
fact
that
the
decisions
in
the
boyce
motor
lines
and
the
st.
johnsbury
cases
had
made
prosecutions
under
the
statute
very
difficult.
that’s
set
forth
in
the
memorandum.
the
senate
passed
the
bill
and
it
went
to
the
house.
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
considered
it
and
a
portion
of
its
report
is
printed
on
page
10
of
our
brief.
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
noted
that
the
senate's
language
created
an
almost
absolute
liability.
the
house
committee
said,
“there
are
judicial
pronouncements
as
to
what
constitutes
a
knowing
violation
under
the
present
act
and
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
anything,
except
a
reference
to
the
boyce
and
the
st.
johnsbury
cases.”
the
house
committee
also
said,
that
under
the
senate
language,
little
more
than
proof
that
the
violation
had
occurred
would
be
needed.
the
house
said,
“in
view
of
the
various
substantial
penalties
which
are
provided
under
the
statute,
it
is
our
considered
judgment
that
such
a
substantial
departure
from
the
existing
law
is
not
warranted.”
they
said,
“it
is
our
purpose
to
retain
the
present
law
by
providing
that
a
person
must
knowingly
violate
the
regulations.”
now,
the
government
says
in
oral
argument
and
in
its
brief,
“that
congress
only
wanted
to
preserve
traditional
scienter
requirements
of
the
word
“knowingly”,
that
is
not
correct.
both
the
senate
and
the
house
committees
in
their
reports
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
specifically
referred
to
the
fact
that
under
section
835,
the
defendant
must
have
knowledge
of
violating
the
regulation
under
that
section
of
the
statute.
now,
it
is
clear
that
the
senate
did
not
want
the
absolute
liability
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
version.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no.
i'm
saying
that
at
that
time,
the
provision
which
now
appears
in
834
(f)
appeared
in
835
and
when
congress
passed
these
amendments
in
1960,
they
re-codified
those
two
sections
which
were
then
834
and
835,
and
that
specific
provision
which
was
then
an
835
is
now
834
(f).
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
this
charge
is
under
834
(f)
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
correct.
now,
the
government’s
position
here
would
impose
a
more
stringent
liability
than
the
senate
language
and
as
i
say,
the
senate
did
not
want
the
absolute
liability
of
the
commission
version
and
the
house
did
not
want
the
almost
absolute
liability
of
the
senate
version.
and
i
think
an
illustration
would
make
that
clear.
suppose
that
a
shipper
who
had
never
heard
of
these
regulations
brought
a
shipment
of
sulfuric
acid
to
the
carrier
and
said,
“ship
this
for
me”,
and
he
perhaps
abbreviated
the
names
sulfuric
acid
or
perhaps
didn’t
put
on
the
proper
shipping
classification.
under
the
senate
version,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
because
he
who
had
no
knowledge
of
the
regulations.
but
under
this
version
that
the
government
now
supposes,
he
could
be
prosecuted
because
that
would
be
all
that
would
be
required
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
chief
justice’s
illustration
on
the
olive
oil.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
wording
of
the
information
that
if
that
there
was
a
mistake,
if
they
actually
shipped
sulfuric
acid,
and
that
they
knowingly
failed
to
show
on
the
shipping
papers
that
it
was
sulfuric
acid.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
because
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
because
your
honor,
when
they
get
to
a
jury,
they’re
going
to
argue
that
this
particular
violation
and
the
wording
of
the
information
that
carriers
no
element
of
a
culpable
intent
as
this
court
has
said
in
boyce
and
as
they
said
in
st.
johnsbury,
and
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
should
say
it
is.
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
be
subjected
to
a
trial
on
an
information
that
properly
doesn’t
charge
an
offense
under
the
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
things,
i
don’t
really
quite
understand
what
so
wrong
about
requiring
the
government
to
charge
an
offense
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
why
is
the
government
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
--
so
reluctant
to
do
that
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
the
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
it
should
have
said
that
the
defendant
did
knowingly
violate
the
regulation.
knowingly
violate
the
regulation,
not
knowingly
do
an
act
in
violation
of
the
regulation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
but
it’s
our
contention
that
the
defendant
did
not
knowingly
violate
the
regulation.
this
was
a
little
--
this
had
happened
to
be
a
little
phrase
that
got
slipped
into
the
regulations
about
when
the
department
of
transportation
took
over
these
things
from
the
commission
and
they
added
this
requirement
of
the
showing
of
a
classification
on
the
shipping
papers.
now,
i
grant
that
that
is
something
that
can
be
shown
at
the
trial.
but
i
think
that
if
the
issue
on
the
trial
is
whether
we
knowingly
violated
the
regulation
then
i
see
no
reason
at
all,
why
the
government
should
not
be
required
to
allege
that
we
knowingly
violated
the
regulation
and
to
prove
that
violation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no.
at
this
point,
we
are
not
your
honor.
now,
in
throughout
all
of
these
cases
and
a
lot
of
them
have
been
decided
here
they
run
the
gamut
from
the
common
law
crimes
which
been
taken
over
by
the
statute,
the
public
welfare
offenses
in
which
this
court
have
said
that,
no
such
element
is
required.
but
there
is
one
thing
that
goes
through
all
of
these
cases
and
that
is
that
the
intent
of
congress
must
govern.
now,
congress
has
wide
latitude
in
defining
this
offense.
as
i
have
pointed
out
previously,
they
defined
the
offense
differently
in
section
834
and
the
way
they
defined
it
in
832
and
833,
and
i
submit
that
the
intent
of
congress
must
govern.
it’s
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
subject
to
these
heavy
penalties
of
a
$1,000.00
for
each
offense
and
a
year
in
the
federal
penitentiary
for
an
inadvertent
violation
of
these
regulations.
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
district
court
was
quite
correct
in
its
reasoning,
that
the
information
here
does
not
charge
an
offense
under
section
834
and
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
to
state
an
offense
against
the
united
states
under
section
834
(f)
of
title
18.
our
position
with
respect
to
that
issue
can
be
very
briefly
stated
in
three
propositions.
first,
the
involved
statute
punishes
only
one
who
knowingly
violates
the
regulation;
second,
to
state
an
offense
under
the
statute,
the
defendant
must
be
charged
with
knowingly
violating
the
regulations;
and
third,
the
information
here
does
not
charge
the
defendant
with
knowingly
violating
the
regulation.
therefore,
the
court
properly
dismissed
the
information.
that
was
the
sole
reasoning
of
the
court
and
i
submit
that
its
reasoning
was
correct.
the
court
didn’t
go
any
further
than
that.
there's
been
no
trial,
no
evidence
submitted.
the
court
simply
dismissed
the
information.
the
first
proposition
as
i
submit
self
evident
from
the
wording
of
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
punish
an
unknowing
violation
whether
or
not
the
defendant
intended
to
do
the
act
that
he
did.
it
only
punishes
a
knowing
violation.
the
second
proposition
naturally
follows
from
the
first
one
and
i
don’t
believe
there
can
be
any
argument
about
that
under
the
well-known
rule
that
the
information
must
charge
all
the
essential
elements
of
defense.
it
must
charge
the
defendant
with
the
knowing
violation.
so,
we
come
to
the
crucial
question
which
is,
“did
the
information
charge
the
defendant
with
a
knowing
violation.”
well,
it
didn’t
do
so
in
expressed
terms.
the
charge
is
a
knowing
act
which
happens
to
be
in
violation
of
the
regulation.
but
that
is
not
the
offense
which
is
punishable
by
the
statute.
the
government
doesn’t
really
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that’s
correct.
the
charges
that
the
defendant
knowingly
did
enact
which
happens
to
be
in
violation
of
the
regulation
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
which
was
in
violation
of
the
regulation.
but
our
position
is
that
the
statutory
offense
and
the
only
offense
is
a
knowing
violation
of
the
regulation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
they
should
have
been
charged
that
the
defendant
knowingly
violated
the
regulation
by
doing
whatever
acts
they
alleged.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
makes
it
a
very
vital
difference,
your
honor.
the
reasons
which
i
will
state
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
the
statute
says,
“whoever
knowingly
violates
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
your
honor.
“whoever
knowingly
violates
them
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
say
--
i
say
he
must
be
charged
with
a
“knowing
violation”.
now,
i
don’t
come
to
the
question
of
proof.
i
don’t
come
to
the
question
yet,
of
what
proof
would
be
sufficient
to
show
a
knowing
violation.
my
only
point
here
and
the
only
point
involved
here
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
that’s
our
contention
that
he
must
be
charged
with
a
“knowing
violation
of
the
regulation.”
now,
the
government
argument
deals
with
the
meaning
of
the
term
knowingly.
they
have
a
long
argument
in
their
brief
about
the
scienter
requirements
of
the
word
“knowingly.”
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
if
there,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
if
their
right
that
the
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
that’s
correct.
if
that’s
all
the
statute
punishes
but
that
isn’t
what
the
statute
punishes.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that’s
what
the
argument
about,
yes.
now,
the
district
court
didn’t
ever
consider
any
of
the
questions,
as
i
say.
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
and
i
would
agree
that
what
constitutes
knowing
violations
should
only
be
decided
upon
a
trial
of
the
issues.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
not
necessarily,
it
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
but
that
has
--
that
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
violation
of
this
particular
regulation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
don’t
think
necessarily
that
he
is
bound
to
know
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
think
if
you
got
to
a
question
of
proof
that
that
would
certainly
be
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
he
negligently
failed
to
be
aware
of
the
regulations.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
well,
no
the
charge
does
not
track
the
statute,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
and
certainly
the
decision
in
the
st.
johnsbury
case
makes
it
clear.
the
necessary
implication
of
the
boyce
case
makes
it
clear,
mr.
justice
brennan’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
freed
case,
i
believe
it
was,
makes
it
clear
that
there's
a
distinction
between
the
terms.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
they
didn’t
address
themselves
to
that
subject.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no.
no,
your
honor
they
did
not.
they
--
the
question
--
the
government’s
argument
necessarily
comes
down
to
this
proposition
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
statute
which
says,
“whosoever
knowingly
does
an
act
in
violation
of
a
regulation
is
guilty
of
an
offense.”
and
the
statute
which
says,
“whosoever
knowingly
violates
a
regulation
is
guilty
of
an
offense.”
the
government
says,
“this
is
typical
language,
that
it’s
standard
language.
it
isn’t
typical
standard
at
all.”
the
language
in
834
is
different
from
what
congress
used
in
832
and
833
of
the
same
statute.
that
is
the
language
that
the
government
wants
and
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
made
that
distinction.
it
wrote
that
scienter
requirements
are
different
in
section
834
from
the
requirements
in
832
and
833.
and
it
certainly
knew
exactly
what
it
was
doing
when
it
did
that.
the
question
that
the
government
wants
to
do
is
that
they
want
to
take
the
word
knowingly
out
of
a
place
in
the
statute
where
congress
put
it
and
put
it
somewhere
else
which
completely
changes
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
government
--
it
isn’t
the
question
of
proving
it
--
i
think
the
government
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
the
statute
means
what
it
says
and
they
have
to
charge
it
“knowing
violation”,
they
probable
can’t
prove
it
in
this
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
i
also
have
the
three
points
that
mr.
dienelt
had
with
respect
to
the
argument.
the
meaning
of
the
words,
the
judicial
interpretations
and
the
legislative
intent,
as
i
have
pointed
out
that
this
is
not
a
typical
statute.
it
is
not
standard
terminology,
congress
itself
drew
the
distinction
between
the
meaning
of
the
word,
“knowingly”
as
they
used
it
section
834
and
as
they
used
it
in
sections
832
and
833.
in
the
boyce
motor
line
case,
this
court
said
that
that
statute
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
thank
you.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
just
finished
discussing
the
wording
of
the
statute.
before
getting
to
the
legislative
history,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
few
minutes
with
respect
to
the
boyce
case
and
the
st.
johnsbury
case.
in
the
boyce
motor
lines
case,
this
court
held
that
the
statute
in
question
punishes
only
those
who
“knowingly
violate
the
regulation.”
the
court
said
that
the
presence
of
a
culpable
intent
is
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense.
the
government
says
that
the
court
did
not
discuss
the
question
of
knowledge
which
is
true
because
that
question
was
not
involved
in
the
case.
however,
the
presence
of
the
culpable
intent
cannot
be
squared
with
the
wording
of
the
information
which
the
government
wants
to
use
in
this
case.
now,
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
only
to
the
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
think
--
oh
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
correct,
that
could.
that
is
a
question
for
the
trial
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
government
does
not
have
to
charge
the
offense
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
confine
its
proof
to
the
offense
set
forth
in
the
statute.
now
in
the
st.
johnsbury
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
first
circuit
reversed
the
district
court’s
finding
of
guilty
under
this
statute
and
said
that
the
court
had
erred
because
it
found
that
there
was
no
element
of
culpable
intent
necessary.
and
in
chief
judge
magruder’s
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
he
took
up
this
very
point
and
he
explained
the
difference
between
an
act
knowingly
done
and
which
happened
to
be
in
violation
of
the
regulation
and
a
knowing
violation
of
the
regulation.
and
he
made
that
very
clear
and
he
says,
“it
depends
upon
how
the
offense
is
defined
by
congress.”
he
says,
“that
this
makes
the
hard
for
the
government
to
prosecute
the
cases.
it’s
up
to
congress
to
fix
it
because
they
can
define
the
offense.”
now,
i
think
if
those
cases
are
not
the
answer
to
this.
the
legislative
history
for
the
1960
amendments
is
conclusive
because
the
commission
which
at
that
time
had
jurisdiction
over
these
regulations,
they’ve
since
been
transferred
to
the
department
of
transportation.
but
at
that
time,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
jurisdiction
and
they
took
judge
magruder’s
suggestion.
and
they
requested
in
the
85th
congress,
they
requested
the
passage
of
a
bill
making
various
amendments
to
this
act
and
among
that
was
an
amendment
to
delete
the
word
“knowingly”
from
what
was
then
section
835.
it’s
the
same
section
which
is
now
834.
the
senate
and
the
85th
congress
noted
that
the
deletion
of
the
word
“knowingly”
would
create
an
absolute
liability
for
violation
of
the
section
and
the
senate
said,
“we
don’t
want
to
go
that
far.”
so,
they
substituted
the
language
reading
as
follows,
“any
person
who
being
aware
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
formulated
regulations
for
the
safe
transportation
of
explosives
and
other
dangerous
articles,
now
i'm
paraphrasing,
would
be
guilty
of
an
offense
if
there
was
a
noncompliance
with
the
regulations.”
that
bill
passed
the
senate,
i
believe,
but
failed
to
pass
the
house.
in
the
86th
congress,
the
commission
resubmitted
the
draft
bill
and
in
this
case
they
took
the
senate’s
language.
they
submitted
the
statement
of
justification
in
favor
of
the
proposed
amendment,
a
portion
of
which
we
have
printed
in
the
appendix.
that
position
--
the
position
of
the
commission
was
that
the
word,
“knowingly”
should
be
simply
deleted
from
the
statute.
but
in
view
of
the
amendments
which
a
senate
language
had
made
in
the
85th
congress,
the
commission
now
took
the
senate
language
and
said,
“this
is
preferable
to
what
we
have.”
now,
in
the
statement
of
justification,
the
principle
reason
that
they
used
was
the
fact
that
the
decisions
in
the
boyce
motor
lines
and
the
st.
johnsbury
cases
had
made
prosecutions
under
the
statute
very
difficult.
that’s
set
forth
in
the
memorandum.
the
senate
passed
the
bill
and
it
went
to
the
house.
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
considered
it
and
a
portion
of
its
report
is
printed
on
page
10
of
our
brief.
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
noted
that
the
senate's
language
created
an
almost
absolute
liability.
the
house
committee
said,
“there
are
judicial
pronouncements
as
to
what
constitutes
a
knowing
violation
under
the
present
act
and
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
anything,
except
a
reference
to
the
boyce
and
the
st.
johnsbury
cases.”
the
house
committee
also
said,
that
under
the
senate
language,
little
more
than
proof
that
the
violation
had
occurred
would
be
needed.
the
house
said,
“in
view
of
the
various
substantial
penalties
which
are
provided
under
the
statute,
it
is
our
considered
judgment
that
such
a
substantial
departure
from
the
existing
law
is
not
warranted.”
they
said,
“it
is
our
purpose
to
retain
the
present
law
by
providing
that
a
person
must
knowingly
violate
the
regulations.”
now,
the
government
says
in
oral
argument
and
in
its
brief,
“that
congress
only
wanted
to
preserve
traditional
scienter
requirements
of
the
word
“knowingly”,
that
is
not
correct.
both
the
senate
and
the
house
committees
in
their
reports
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
specifically
referred
to
the
fact
that
under
section
835,
the
defendant
must
have
knowledge
of
violating
the
regulation
under
that
section
of
the
statute.
now,
it
is
clear
that
the
senate
did
not
want
the
absolute
liability
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
version.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no.
i'm
saying
that
at
that
time,
the
provision
which
now
appears
in
834
(f)
appeared
in
835
and
when
congress
passed
these
amendments
in
1960,
they
re-codified
those
two
sections
which
were
then
834
and
835,
and
that
specific
provision
which
was
then
an
835
is
now
834
(f).
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
this
charge
is
under
834
(f)
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
correct.
now,
the
government’s
position
here
would
impose
a
more
stringent
liability
than
the
senate
language
and
as
i
say,
the
senate
did
not
want
the
absolute
liability
of
the
commission
version
and
the
house
did
not
want
the
almost
absolute
liability
of
the
senate
version.
and
i
think
an
illustration
would
make
that
clear.
suppose
that
a
shipper
who
had
never
heard
of
these
regulations
brought
a
shipment
of
sulfuric
acid
to
the
carrier
and
said,
“ship
this
for
me”,
and
he
perhaps
abbreviated
the
names
sulfuric
acid
or
perhaps
didn’t
put
on
the
proper
shipping
classification.
under
the
senate
version,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
because
he
who
had
no
knowledge
of
the
regulations.
but
under
this
version
that
the
government
now
supposes,
he
could
be
prosecuted
because
that
would
be
all
that
would
be
required
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
chief
justice’s
illustration
on
the
olive
oil.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
wording
of
the
information
that
if
that
there
was
a
mistake,
if
they
actually
shipped
sulfuric
acid,
and
that
they
knowingly
failed
to
show
on
the
shipping
papers
that
it
was
sulfuric
acid.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
because
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
because
your
honor,
when
they
get
to
a
jury,
they’re
going
to
argue
that
this
particular
violation
and
the
wording
of
the
information
that
carriers
no
element
of
a
culpable
intent
as
this
court
has
said
in
boyce
and
as
they
said
in
st.
johnsbury,
and
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
i
should
say
it
is.
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
be
subjected
to
a
trial
on
an
information
that
properly
doesn’t
charge
an
offense
under
the
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
things,
i
don’t
really
quite
understand
what
so
wrong
about
requiring
the
government
to
charge
an
offense
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
why
is
the
government
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
--
so
reluctant
to
do
that
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
the
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
it
should
have
said
that
the
defendant
did
knowingly
violate
the
regulation.
knowingly
violate
the
regulation,
not
knowingly
do
an
act
in
violation
of
the
regulation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
but
it’s
our
contention
that
the
defendant
did
not
knowingly
violate
the
regulation.
this
was
a
little
--
this
had
happened
to
be
a
little
phrase
that
got
slipped
into
the
regulations
about
when
the
department
of
transportation
took
over
these
things
from
the
commission
and
they
added
this
requirement
of
the
showing
of
a
classification
on
the
shipping
papers.
now,
i
grant
that
that
is
something
that
can
be
shown
at
the
trial.
but
i
think
that
if
the
issue
on
the
trial
is
whether
we
knowingly
violated
the
regulation
then
i
see
no
reason
at
all,
why
the
government
should
not
be
required
to
allege
that
we
knowingly
violated
the
regulation
and
to
prove
that
violation.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no.
at
this
point,
we
are
not
your
honor.
now,
in
throughout
all
of
these
cases
and
a
lot
of
them
have
been
decided
here
they
run
the
gamut
from
the
common
law
crimes
which
been
taken
over
by
the
statute,
the
public
welfare
offenses
in
which
this
court
have
said
that,
no
such
element
is
required.
but
there
is
one
thing
that
goes
through
all
of
these
cases
and
that
is
that
the
intent
of
congress
must
govern.
now,
congress
has
wide
latitude
in
defining
this
offense.
as
i
have
pointed
out
previously,
they
defined
the
offense
differently
in
section
834
and
the
way
they
defined
it
in
832
and
833,
and
i
submit
that
the
intent
of
congress
must
govern.
it’s
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
subject
to
these
heavy
penalties
of
a
$1,000.00
for
each
offense
and
a
year
in
the
federal
penitentiary
for
an
inadvertent
violation
of
these
regulations.
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
district
court
was
quite
correct
in
its
reasoning,
that
the
information
here
does
not
charge
an
offense
under
section
834
and
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
