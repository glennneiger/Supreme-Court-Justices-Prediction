mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland
which
affirmed
an
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
baltimore
city,
upholding
a
decision
by
the
state
board
of
censors
disapproving
the
film
“i
am
curious
yellow”
for
exhibition
in
the
state
of
maryland.
the
maryland
film
censorship
scheme
under
which
“i
am
curious
yellow”
was
banned
throughout
the
state
is
an
amended
version
of
the
law
which
this
court
held
without
dissent
to
be
an
unconstitutional
previous
restraint
in
freedman
v.
maryland.
maryland
in
fact
is
the
only
state
today
which
still
retains
a
law
on
its
books,
making
criminal
the
failure
of
motion
picture
exhibitors
to
obtain
prior
approval
by
a
censorship
board
of
a
film
intended
to
be
shown
to
adults.
“i
am
curios
yellow”
was
imported
from
sweden
by
it's
american
distributor
grove
press
and
it
immediately
became
the
subject
of
a
custom's
forfeiture
proceeding,
but
11
months
later
was
finally
held
to
be
constitutionally
protected
and
not
obscene
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
soon
thereafter,
appellant,
five
west
amusement
company,
inc.
contracted
with
grove
to
exhibit
“i
am
curios
yellow”
in
baltimore.
in
accordance
with
grove's
national
distribution
policy,
the
agreement
provided
that
admission
to
the
film
would
be
limited
to
persons
18
years
of
age
and
older
and
the
grove
would
control
all
advertising
copy.
on
july
1,
1969
as
required
by
the
statute,
appellants
submitted
“i
am
curious
yellow”
to
the
maryland
film
censorship
board
consisting
of
three
adult
ladies,
who
following
consultation
with
the
state's
chief
law
enforcement
officer
and
the
honorable
attorney
general
of
maryland,
found
the
film
obscene.
no
record
was
made
of
the
board's
proceedings
and
although
witnesses
were
heard,
their
identity
and
their
testimony
was
kept
secret.
no
findings
or
supporting
reasons
were
given
by
the
board
in
issuing
its
decision.
as
required
by
the
statute,
following
its
disapproval,
the
censorship
board
petitioned
the
circuit
court
of
baltimore
city
asking
it
to
approve
its
decision.
and
after
a
hearing,
an
adversary
hearing
in
which
witnesses
were
heard
on
both
sides,
the
court
affirmed
the
board's
decision.
appellants
here
appealed
that
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
which
considered
the
matter
de
novo
and
found
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
the
motion
picture
obscene.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
reached
its
decision
by
a
four
to
three
division,
disagreeing
sharply
over
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
application
of
this
court's
roth-memoirs
test
for
distinguishing
protected
expression
from
obscenity.
the
majority
saw
fit
also
to
disregard
the
decision
reached
with
regard
to
the
same
film
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
two
to
one.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
was
a
majority
of
two
to
one,
judges
hayes
and
friendly
in
the
majority
and
chief
judge
lumbard
dissenting.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
i
was
going
to
--
in
fact
your
honor,
would
have
referred
later
to
chief
judge
lumbard's
dissent
in
that
case.
i
think
it
is
notorious
that
there
are
very
rare
cases
in
this
field
in
which
there
is
not
a
division
of
the
justices
at
whatever
level
of
court
we
may
look
at.
the
issues
presented
by
this
appeal
are
two-fold.
before
i
get
to
the
issues,
i
would
like
to
state
that
in
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland's
majority
opinion,
although
the
majority
applied
the
roth-memoirs
three-pronged
test,
the
court
gave
special
weight
to
“the
visual
impact
of
a
motion
picture
as
contrasted
with
the
printed
word.”
the
issues
presented
by
this
appeal
are
two.
first
is
the
maryland
statute
defective
as
applied
to
“i
am
curious
yellow,”
and
second
is
“i
am
curious
yellow”
obscenity
or
is
it
protected
expression.
it
is
our
position
that
the
maryland
film
censorship
scheme
is
fatally
defective
because
it
is
over
broad
and
because
it
fails
to
provide
adequate
procedural
safeguards.
the
statute
requires
the
board
to
disapprove
any
film
that
is
obscene.
the
only
definition
of
obscene
provided
by
the
statute
however
reaches
any
film
whose
effect
is
to
“arouse
sexual
desires,”
if
that
affect
probably
“outweighs
whatever
other
merits
the
film
may
posses.”
the
trouble
with
this
definition
is
that
it
is
in
conflict
with
roth
and
every
other
case
that
is
followed.
this
court
has
never
to
my
knowledge
suggested
that
books
or
films
maybe
censored
for
arousing
sexual
desires.
any
film
with
a
handsome
actor
might
be
perceived
by
lady
censors
as
arousing
sexual
desires
particularly
if
the
actor
appears
naked
if
only
for
a
few
moments
as
he
did
in
“i
am
curious
yellow.”
similarly,
any
film
starring
a
nude
woman
maybe
perceived
by
a
man
as
arousing
sexual
desires,
particularly
if
the
man
--
i'm
sorry,
particularly
if
the
actress
appears
naked
even
for
a
few
moments
as
she
did
in
“i
am
curious
yellow.”
moreover,
the
statute
commands
that
the
arousing
affect
be
weighed
against
the
film's
other
values.
in
this
respect
it
is
submitted,
the
statute
is
in
conflict
with
this
court's
judgment
and
mr.
justice
goldberg's
opinion
in
jacobellis
versus
ohio
and
is
also
in
conflict,
we
submit,
with
mr.
justice
white's
dissent
in
memoirs
v.
massachusetts.
finally,
the
board
is
not
required
by
the
statute
to
consider
whether
the
film
goes
substantially
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
in
its
sexual
depictions
as
this
court
in
manual
enterprises
versus
day
held
must
be
done
before
material
can
be
found
obscene.
in
this
regard,
the
film
is
also
in
conflict
with
this
court's
judgments
and
the
prevailing
opinions
in
jacobellis,
memoirs
and
redrup
versus
united
states.
secondly,
the
maryland
censorship
scheme
is
defective
because
of
its
procedural
defects.
no
record
is
made
or
required
to
be
made.
the
witnesses,
there
is
no
requirement
that
witnesses
be
revealed
and
their
deliberations,
the
deliberations
of
the
board
are
secret.
no
grounds
are
given
for
a
decision.
the
censors
here
have
no
function
other
than
censorship
whereas
in
the
case
of
the
post
office
as
has
been
described
today
a
possibly
analogous
role,
the
censors
deal
with
other
matters
than
obscenity.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
that
is
sure
correct.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
believe
that
there
have
been
opinions
of
the
justices
of
this
court,
including
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
the
effect
that
it
maybe
necessary
for
the
statute
itself
to
define
with
specificity
the
requirements
and
criterion
for
censorship.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
--
and
in
the
case
of
aptheker
versus
secretary
of
state
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
44,
the
court
i
think
clearly
held
that
the
courts
are
not
unlimited
in
the
authority
to
rewrite
otherwise
defective
statutes.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
maybe
the
way
you
take
them.
i'm
not
sure
that
a
censorship
board
would
take
it
that
way.
the
ladies
on
the
censorship
board
are
not
i
think
trained
in
the
law.
there
is
no
indication
to
what
extent
of
[voice
overlap]
mr.
edward
de
grazia
we
are,
yes
your
honor,
but
we
are
here
dealing
also
with
the
censorship
system
which
requires
the
prior
submission
and
the
suppression
by
a
board,
an
administrative
board
of
material
which
only
later
is
judicially
adjudicated
for
its
obscenity.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
statute
permitted
this
film
or
any
film,
at
least
any
film
which
had
been
the
subject
of
a
prior
positive
judicial
action
to
remain
free
for
exhibition
during
the
pendency
of
the
board's
hearings
and
the
legal
proceedings
thereafter,
i
would
say
yes.
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
the
teaching
of
this
court
that
censors
are
--
the
censorship
boards
are
free
to
reach
erroneous
conclusions
through
inadequate
practices
and
procedures
subject
to
the
saving
grace
of
a
final
judicial
decision
which
as
is
perfectly
plain
in
this
case
is
more
than
a
year
after
the
film
was
originally
suppressed
in
maryland.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
also
to
kingsley
books
v.
brown
in
which
the
court
held
that
material
ought
to
be
permitted
to
circulate,
pending
a
judicial
decision
--
pending
a
final
judicial
decision
subject
only
to
a
subsequent
contempt
proceeding.
again,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
film
already
known
to
the
censorship
board
and
known
to
the
courts,
the
film
already
had
been
held
constitutionally
protected
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
surely
in
the
case
such
as
this,
there
is
no
sufficient
warrant
for
a
board
or
a
court
to
suppress
the
exhibition
of
a
film,
pending
a
final
adjudication
by
this
court.
my
second
point
is
that
“i
am
curious
yellow”
cannot
be
held
obscene
under
any
of
this
court's
test
since
roth.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
would
suggest
that
in
an
area
as
filled
with
difficulties
as
this
one
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
indeed,
the
district,
the
circuit
court
of
baltimore
should
have
heeded
the
--
should
have
not
followed
the
decision
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
but
should
have
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
if
a
majority
of
a
high
federal
bench
sees
social
importance
in
a
film,
sees
no
insufficient
prurient
appeal
and
insufficient
patent
offensiveness
in
a
film,
that
surely,
the
film
cannot
be
said
to
be
utterly
without
for
example
social
importance,
utterly
without
value.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
decision
by
any
justice,
any
judge
of
a
federal
or
state
court
should
be
enough
to
warn
another
--
a
sister
court
away
from
a
decision
which
suppresses
a
film.
in
roth,
this
court
said
that
obscenity
was
not
protected
expression,
but
in
doing
so,
the
court
emphasized
that
sex
was
not
synonymous
with
obscenity.
the
portrayal
of
sex
for
example
in
art,
literature
and
scientific
works
is
not
sufficient
reason
this
court
said,
to
deny
material
of
the
constitutional
protection
of
speech
and
press.
that
reasoning,
we
feel
precisely
covers
this
case.
“i
am
curious
yellow”
is
two
hours
of
filmed
art.
dozens
of
witnesses
and
critiques
prove
that
were
it
not
otherwise
perfectly
clear
from
a
viewing
of
this
film.
the
portrayal
in
this
film
of
ten
minutes
of
sexual
relations
cannot
be
taken
to
destroy
the
film's
entitlement
to
constitutional
protection.
the
relationship
of
the
sexual
episodes
to
the
balance
of
the
film
was
described
at
the
trial
and
is
contained
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
at
footnote
32.
i
would
like
to
merely
read
to
you
one
sentence
of
what
mr.
vincent
canby,
the
new
york
times
film
critique
said
on
this
point.
“a
full
length
portrait
of
lena,
the
troubled,
liberated
woman
simply
could
not
exist
without
these
sexual
scenes.”
as
judge
hayes
said
in
the
second
circuit
decision,
“whatever
the
dominant
theme
of
this
film
may
said
to
be,
it
is
certainly
not
sex.”
moreover,
not
only
is
the
sexual
theme
subordinate,
but
it
is
handled
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
at
least
extremely
doubtful
that
interest
in
it
should
be
characterized
as
prurient.
the
same
conclusion
that
this
film
is
constitutionally
protected
also
plainly
follows
from
this
court's
decision
subsequent
to
roth.
i
would
wish
to
mention
at
this
juncture
two
important
facts
about
the
roth-memoirs
test.
first
as
was
documented
by
the
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography's
recent
report,
and
i
must
quote
this
to
you,
“the
three-part
definition
adopted
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
the
fanny
hill
case
is
the
version
which
has
been
codified
into
a
number
of
state
statutes,
and
it
is
the
one
which
is
almost
universally
used
in
state
and
lower
federal
courts.”
second,
the
judgments
required
by
memoirs
are
enormously
difficult
to
make
with
regard
to
particular
materials
and
it
is
very
easy
for
different
judges
and
jurors
to
reach
opposite
conclusions
as
the
same
works.
as
is
well
known,
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
are
that
all
laws
which
prohibit
or
interfere
with
consensual
distribution
of
obscene
materials
to
adult
should
be
repealed.
and
that
as
this
court
has
intimated
in
such
decisions
as
redrup
and
stanley,
and
rowan
v.
post
office,
only
laws
aimed
at
the
protection
of
juveniles
or
at
the
prevention
of
obtrusive
or
assaultive
communications
to
unwilling
or
captive
adults,
are
consistent
with
the
constitutional
values
of
free
expression.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
that
is
our
position.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
perhaps,
i
could
say
a
few
more
words
about
it.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
seems
to
me
that
this
field
already
replete
with
conflicting
decisions,
conflicting
rules,
overlapping
tests
could
be
improved
where
state
courts
to
lend
the
courtesy
or
the
supremacy
to
the
judgments
of
federal
courts
in
this
area.
i
would
think
that
the
federal
courts
might
similarly
respect
the
prior
judgments
of
state
courts
at
least
if
the
state
courts
are
applying
the
correct
standards.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
applied
standards
different
from
those
which
maryland
chose
to
apply.
in
such
situations,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prior
judicial
decision
should
be
treated
as
in
effect
binding
on
the
second
court.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
wouldn't.
i
haven't
investigated
that
matter,
but
i
doubt
that
i
would.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
if,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
differently,
we
would
have
appealed
that
decision
to
this
court.
and
i
had
being
involved
in
that
case
had
every
confidence
that
this
court
would've
reversed
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
we
should
keep
in
mind
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i'm
sure
that
any
competent
counsel
in
that
case
would
have
appealed
to
this
court.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
a
point
which
now
with
the
report
of
the
commission
on
pornography,
it
seems
to
me
is
doubly
persuasive
and
that
is
in
this
area
where
there's
a
doubt,
the
expression
should
be
permitted
to
continue
and
to
exist.
and
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
expression
and
the
decisions
upholding
the
expression
because
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
social
danger
to
individuals
or
to
society
from
materials
of
the
kind
which
are
suppressed
by
statutes
like
this.
i
mentioned
the
commission's
report
today
not
because
its
findings
are
necessary
to
support
our
side,
they
are
not.
the
roth-memoirs
test
and
in
the
alternative,
the
kingsley
books
v.
brown
and
freedman
cases
are
all
the
law
--
we
believe
we
need
for
reversal.
however,
the
report
is
unquestionably
the
most
important
and
authoritative
commentary
in
this
field
of
obscenity
to
have
appeared
since
the
american
law
institutes's
draft
at
a
modeled
penal
code
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
have
reference
to
it.
in
the
event,
you
should
decide
on
clearer
definitions
or
tests
should
be
introduced
in
this
or
related
cases.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
in
my
judgment,
this
case
and
this
film
provides
this
court
with
a
rare
opportunity
to
reach
a
judgment
that
is
unanimous
and
announce
a
clear
and
uniform
opinion
which
might
significantly
relieve
this
bench
and
lower
state
and
federal
courts
as
well
of
the
flood
of
litigation
and
conflicting
decisions
which
have
been
the
inevitable
prices
paid
for
the
disagreements
between
the
members
of
this
bench
and
for
a
tests
which
fail
adequately
to
be
in
touch
with
the
realities
of
sexual
attitudes,
behavior
and
expression.
i
therefore
suggest
the
court
might
wish
o
go
beyond
the
reversal
of
maryland
on
the
basis
of
roth-memoirs
or
brown-freedman
and
reverse
on
a
basis
of
a
new
formulation
which
finds
it's
common
rationale
in
a
distillation
of
the
wisdom
contained
in
the
opinions
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
manual
enterprises,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
memoirs,
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
ginzburg
and
michigan,
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
redrup,
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
memoirs,
mr.
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
stanley
and
the
chief
justice
opinion
in
rowan.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
yes,
the
rule
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
federal
agencies
and
courts
alike
would
be
admonished
not
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
disseminations
of
films
or
any
other
materials
unless
they
are
hardcore
pornography.
but
they
would
be
given
leeway
to
prevent
or
prosecute
these
whenever
the
mode
of
their
distribution
carries
with
it
the
risk
of
exposure
to
unwilling
adults
or
to
children.
here,
may
i
remind
you
that
general
commercial
motion
picture
distributions
generally
carries
far
fewer
such
risks
that
is
of
exposure
to
children
or
to
unwilling
adults
than
general
distribution
of
books
and
magazines.
your
honors,
you
all
have
had
an
opportunity
to
see
this
film
and
to
have
experience
its
dominating
concern
with
political
and
social
and
moral
values.
its
exploration
of
personal
and
national
ethics
of
violence
and
non-violence,
of
criticism
of
american,
swedish,
russian,
chinese
and
spanish
governments,
of
youthful
reactions
to
the
war
in
vietnam
and
the
aspirations
for
a
country
which
could
adopt
the
policy
of
non-violent
defense,
of
the
ideals
of
martin
luther
king,
of
the
irresponsibility
of
some
parents
and
the
anger
of
their
children.
we
have
furnished
the
court
with
--
the
members
of
the
court
with
copies
of
the
film
scenario
so
that
you
may
be
able
if
desire
to
refresh
your
recollection
of
the
film's
social
themes
and
intellectual
ideas.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
this
film
has
been
shown
to
5.5
million
persons
in
40
states
of
the
union
and
approximately
180
cities.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
south
seems
to
be
a
little
more
resistant
to
the
exhibition
of
this
film
and
parts
of
the
midwest
also
than
the
north
and
the
far
west.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
people
are
going
to
see
it
all
over,
yes.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
except
in
maryland.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
your
honor,
we
are
concerned.
we
were
concerned
for
the
state
of
freedom
in
this
country
for
motion
pictures.
we're
concerned
about
--
for
the
state
of
freedom
for
other
motion
pictures
that
these
appellants
might
want
to
distribute
or
exhibit
and
we're
concerned
for
the
fate
of
other
films,
books,
magazines
and
newspapers
that
it
should
be
distributed
throughout
the
country.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
mentioned
that.
we
touched
on
that
in
our
brief,
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
our
brief
on
the
merits.
i
think
that
--
i
personally
cannot
see
how
this
country
can
tolerate
a
constitution
which
gives
a
man
freedom
of
expression
or
to
receive
--
gives
a
man
freedom
to
receive
ideas
which
is
totally
dependent
on
state,
county
or
municipal
boundaries.
i
think
there
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
of
the
constitutional
laws
in
such
a
case.
i
would
like
to
say
the
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
de
grazia
distributors
and
exhibitors
under
the
laws
as
it
stands
in
this
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
didn't
hear
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i'm
sorry,
would
you
repeat
your
question?
mr.
edward
de
grazia
they
are
not
parties.
it
is
the
responsibility
for
supporting
their
rights,
and
defending
their
rights
under
the
law
of
this
land
seems
to
rest
on
the
shoulders
of
the
commercial
distributors
and
exhibitors
of
films
and
books
of
this
kind.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it's
the
only
way
we
can
get
to
it.
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
few
minutes
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
would
--
i
believe
almost
--
i
believe
entirely
because
of
litigation
which
commenced
in
those
cases
which
has
not
finally
been
resolved
in
cases
both
civil
and
criminal
which
are
pending
--
which
have
been
suspended
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
have
nothing
to
add
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland
which
affirmed
an
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
baltimore
city,
upholding
a
decision
by
the
state
board
of
censors
disapproving
the
film
“i
am
curious
yellow”
for
exhibition
in
the
state
of
maryland.
the
maryland
film
censorship
scheme
under
which
“i
am
curious
yellow”
was
banned
throughout
the
state
is
an
amended
version
of
the
law
which
this
court
held
without
dissent
to
be
an
unconstitutional
previous
restraint
in
freedman
v.
maryland.
maryland
in
fact
is
the
only
state
today
which
still
retains
a
law
on
its
books,
making
criminal
the
failure
of
motion
picture
exhibitors
to
obtain
prior
approval
by
a
censorship
board
of
a
film
intended
to
be
shown
to
adults.
“i
am
curios
yellow”
was
imported
from
sweden
by
it's
american
distributor
grove
press
and
it
immediately
became
the
subject
of
a
custom's
forfeiture
proceeding,
but
11
months
later
was
finally
held
to
be
constitutionally
protected
and
not
obscene
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
soon
thereafter,
appellant,
five
west
amusement
company,
inc.
contracted
with
grove
to
exhibit
“i
am
curios
yellow”
in
baltimore.
in
accordance
with
grove's
national
distribution
policy,
the
agreement
provided
that
admission
to
the
film
would
be
limited
to
persons
18
years
of
age
and
older
and
the
grove
would
control
all
advertising
copy.
on
july
1,
1969
as
required
by
the
statute,
appellants
submitted
“i
am
curious
yellow”
to
the
maryland
film
censorship
board
consisting
of
three
adult
ladies,
who
following
consultation
with
the
state's
chief
law
enforcement
officer
and
the
honorable
attorney
general
of
maryland,
found
the
film
obscene.
no
record
was
made
of
the
board's
proceedings
and
although
witnesses
were
heard,
their
identity
and
their
testimony
was
kept
secret.
no
findings
or
supporting
reasons
were
given
by
the
board
in
issuing
its
decision.
as
required
by
the
statute,
following
its
disapproval,
the
censorship
board
petitioned
the
circuit
court
of
baltimore
city
asking
it
to
approve
its
decision.
and
after
a
hearing,
an
adversary
hearing
in
which
witnesses
were
heard
on
both
sides,
the
court
affirmed
the
board's
decision.
appellants
here
appealed
that
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
which
considered
the
matter
de
novo
and
found
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
the
motion
picture
obscene.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
reached
its
decision
by
a
four
to
three
division,
disagreeing
sharply
over
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
application
of
this
court's
roth-memoirs
test
for
distinguishing
protected
expression
from
obscenity.
the
majority
saw
fit
also
to
disregard
the
decision
reached
with
regard
to
the
same
film
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
two
to
one.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
was
a
majority
of
two
to
one,
judges
hayes
and
friendly
in
the
majority
and
chief
judge
lumbard
dissenting.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
i
was
going
to
--
in
fact
your
honor,
would
have
referred
later
to
chief
judge
lumbard's
dissent
in
that
case.
i
think
it
is
notorious
that
there
are
very
rare
cases
in
this
field
in
which
there
is
not
a
division
of
the
justices
at
whatever
level
of
court
we
may
look
at.
the
issues
presented
by
this
appeal
are
two-fold.
before
i
get
to
the
issues,
i
would
like
to
state
that
in
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland's
majority
opinion,
although
the
majority
applied
the
roth-memoirs
three-pronged
test,
the
court
gave
special
weight
to
“the
visual
impact
of
a
motion
picture
as
contrasted
with
the
printed
word.”
the
issues
presented
by
this
appeal
are
two.
first
is
the
maryland
statute
defective
as
applied
to
“i
am
curious
yellow,”
and
second
is
“i
am
curious
yellow”
obscenity
or
is
it
protected
expression.
it
is
our
position
that
the
maryland
film
censorship
scheme
is
fatally
defective
because
it
is
over
broad
and
because
it
fails
to
provide
adequate
procedural
safeguards.
the
statute
requires
the
board
to
disapprove
any
film
that
is
obscene.
the
only
definition
of
obscene
provided
by
the
statute
however
reaches
any
film
whose
effect
is
to
“arouse
sexual
desires,”
if
that
affect
probably
“outweighs
whatever
other
merits
the
film
may
posses.”
the
trouble
with
this
definition
is
that
it
is
in
conflict
with
roth
and
every
other
case
that
is
followed.
this
court
has
never
to
my
knowledge
suggested
that
books
or
films
maybe
censored
for
arousing
sexual
desires.
any
film
with
a
handsome
actor
might
be
perceived
by
lady
censors
as
arousing
sexual
desires
particularly
if
the
actor
appears
naked
if
only
for
a
few
moments
as
he
did
in
“i
am
curious
yellow.”
similarly,
any
film
starring
a
nude
woman
maybe
perceived
by
a
man
as
arousing
sexual
desires,
particularly
if
the
man
--
i'm
sorry,
particularly
if
the
actress
appears
naked
even
for
a
few
moments
as
she
did
in
“i
am
curious
yellow.”
moreover,
the
statute
commands
that
the
arousing
affect
be
weighed
against
the
film's
other
values.
in
this
respect
it
is
submitted,
the
statute
is
in
conflict
with
this
court's
judgment
and
mr.
justice
goldberg's
opinion
in
jacobellis
versus
ohio
and
is
also
in
conflict,
we
submit,
with
mr.
justice
white's
dissent
in
memoirs
v.
massachusetts.
finally,
the
board
is
not
required
by
the
statute
to
consider
whether
the
film
goes
substantially
beyond
contemporary
community
standards
in
its
sexual
depictions
as
this
court
in
manual
enterprises
versus
day
held
must
be
done
before
material
can
be
found
obscene.
in
this
regard,
the
film
is
also
in
conflict
with
this
court's
judgments
and
the
prevailing
opinions
in
jacobellis,
memoirs
and
redrup
versus
united
states.
secondly,
the
maryland
censorship
scheme
is
defective
because
of
its
procedural
defects.
no
record
is
made
or
required
to
be
made.
the
witnesses,
there
is
no
requirement
that
witnesses
be
revealed
and
their
deliberations,
the
deliberations
of
the
board
are
secret.
no
grounds
are
given
for
a
decision.
the
censors
here
have
no
function
other
than
censorship
whereas
in
the
case
of
the
post
office
as
has
been
described
today
a
possibly
analogous
role,
the
censors
deal
with
other
matters
than
obscenity.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
that
is
sure
correct.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
believe
that
there
have
been
opinions
of
the
justices
of
this
court,
including
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
the
effect
that
it
maybe
necessary
for
the
statute
itself
to
define
with
specificity
the
requirements
and
criterion
for
censorship.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
--
and
in
the
case
of
aptheker
versus
secretary
of
state
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
44,
the
court
i
think
clearly
held
that
the
courts
are
not
unlimited
in
the
authority
to
rewrite
otherwise
defective
statutes.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
maybe
the
way
you
take
them.
i'm
not
sure
that
a
censorship
board
would
take
it
that
way.
the
ladies
on
the
censorship
board
are
not
i
think
trained
in
the
law.
there
is
no
indication
to
what
extent
of
[voice
overlap]
mr.
edward
de
grazia
we
are,
yes
your
honor,
but
we
are
here
dealing
also
with
the
censorship
system
which
requires
the
prior
submission
and
the
suppression
by
a
board,
an
administrative
board
of
material
which
only
later
is
judicially
adjudicated
for
its
obscenity.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
statute
permitted
this
film
or
any
film,
at
least
any
film
which
had
been
the
subject
of
a
prior
positive
judicial
action
to
remain
free
for
exhibition
during
the
pendency
of
the
board's
hearings
and
the
legal
proceedings
thereafter,
i
would
say
yes.
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
the
teaching
of
this
court
that
censors
are
--
the
censorship
boards
are
free
to
reach
erroneous
conclusions
through
inadequate
practices
and
procedures
subject
to
the
saving
grace
of
a
final
judicial
decision
which
as
is
perfectly
plain
in
this
case
is
more
than
a
year
after
the
film
was
originally
suppressed
in
maryland.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
also
to
kingsley
books
v.
brown
in
which
the
court
held
that
material
ought
to
be
permitted
to
circulate,
pending
a
judicial
decision
--
pending
a
final
judicial
decision
subject
only
to
a
subsequent
contempt
proceeding.
again,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
film
already
known
to
the
censorship
board
and
known
to
the
courts,
the
film
already
had
been
held
constitutionally
protected
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
surely
in
the
case
such
as
this,
there
is
no
sufficient
warrant
for
a
board
or
a
court
to
suppress
the
exhibition
of
a
film,
pending
a
final
adjudication
by
this
court.
my
second
point
is
that
“i
am
curious
yellow”
cannot
be
held
obscene
under
any
of
this
court's
test
since
roth.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
would
suggest
that
in
an
area
as
filled
with
difficulties
as
this
one
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
indeed,
the
district,
the
circuit
court
of
baltimore
should
have
heeded
the
--
should
have
not
followed
the
decision
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
but
should
have
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
if
a
majority
of
a
high
federal
bench
sees
social
importance
in
a
film,
sees
no
insufficient
prurient
appeal
and
insufficient
patent
offensiveness
in
a
film,
that
surely,
the
film
cannot
be
said
to
be
utterly
without
for
example
social
importance,
utterly
without
value.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
decision
by
any
justice,
any
judge
of
a
federal
or
state
court
should
be
enough
to
warn
another
--
a
sister
court
away
from
a
decision
which
suppresses
a
film.
in
roth,
this
court
said
that
obscenity
was
not
protected
expression,
but
in
doing
so,
the
court
emphasized
that
sex
was
not
synonymous
with
obscenity.
the
portrayal
of
sex
for
example
in
art,
literature
and
scientific
works
is
not
sufficient
reason
this
court
said,
to
deny
material
of
the
constitutional
protection
of
speech
and
press.
that
reasoning,
we
feel
precisely
covers
this
case.
“i
am
curious
yellow”
is
two
hours
of
filmed
art.
dozens
of
witnesses
and
critiques
prove
that
were
it
not
otherwise
perfectly
clear
from
a
viewing
of
this
film.
the
portrayal
in
this
film
of
ten
minutes
of
sexual
relations
cannot
be
taken
to
destroy
the
film's
entitlement
to
constitutional
protection.
the
relationship
of
the
sexual
episodes
to
the
balance
of
the
film
was
described
at
the
trial
and
is
contained
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
at
footnote
32.
i
would
like
to
merely
read
to
you
one
sentence
of
what
mr.
vincent
canby,
the
new
york
times
film
critique
said
on
this
point.
“a
full
length
portrait
of
lena,
the
troubled,
liberated
woman
simply
could
not
exist
without
these
sexual
scenes.”
as
judge
hayes
said
in
the
second
circuit
decision,
“whatever
the
dominant
theme
of
this
film
may
said
to
be,
it
is
certainly
not
sex.”
moreover,
not
only
is
the
sexual
theme
subordinate,
but
it
is
handled
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
at
least
extremely
doubtful
that
interest
in
it
should
be
characterized
as
prurient.
the
same
conclusion
that
this
film
is
constitutionally
protected
also
plainly
follows
from
this
court's
decision
subsequent
to
roth.
i
would
wish
to
mention
at
this
juncture
two
important
facts
about
the
roth-memoirs
test.
first
as
was
documented
by
the
commission
on
obscenity
and
pornography's
recent
report,
and
i
must
quote
this
to
you,
“the
three-part
definition
adopted
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
the
fanny
hill
case
is
the
version
which
has
been
codified
into
a
number
of
state
statutes,
and
it
is
the
one
which
is
almost
universally
used
in
state
and
lower
federal
courts.”
second,
the
judgments
required
by
memoirs
are
enormously
difficult
to
make
with
regard
to
particular
materials
and
it
is
very
easy
for
different
judges
and
jurors
to
reach
opposite
conclusions
as
the
same
works.
as
is
well
known,
the
recommendations
of
the
commission
are
that
all
laws
which
prohibit
or
interfere
with
consensual
distribution
of
obscene
materials
to
adult
should
be
repealed.
and
that
as
this
court
has
intimated
in
such
decisions
as
redrup
and
stanley,
and
rowan
v.
post
office,
only
laws
aimed
at
the
protection
of
juveniles
or
at
the
prevention
of
obtrusive
or
assaultive
communications
to
unwilling
or
captive
adults,
are
consistent
with
the
constitutional
values
of
free
expression.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
that
is
our
position.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
perhaps,
i
could
say
a
few
more
words
about
it.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it
seems
to
me
that
this
field
already
replete
with
conflicting
decisions,
conflicting
rules,
overlapping
tests
could
be
improved
where
state
courts
to
lend
the
courtesy
or
the
supremacy
to
the
judgments
of
federal
courts
in
this
area.
i
would
think
that
the
federal
courts
might
similarly
respect
the
prior
judgments
of
state
courts
at
least
if
the
state
courts
are
applying
the
correct
standards.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
applied
standards
different
from
those
which
maryland
chose
to
apply.
in
such
situations,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prior
judicial
decision
should
be
treated
as
in
effect
binding
on
the
second
court.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
wouldn't.
i
haven't
investigated
that
matter,
but
i
doubt
that
i
would.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
if,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
differently,
we
would
have
appealed
that
decision
to
this
court.
and
i
had
being
involved
in
that
case
had
every
confidence
that
this
court
would've
reversed
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
we
should
keep
in
mind
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i'm
sure
that
any
competent
counsel
in
that
case
would
have
appealed
to
this
court.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
a
point
which
now
with
the
report
of
the
commission
on
pornography,
it
seems
to
me
is
doubly
persuasive
and
that
is
in
this
area
where
there's
a
doubt,
the
expression
should
be
permitted
to
continue
and
to
exist.
and
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
expression
and
the
decisions
upholding
the
expression
because
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
social
danger
to
individuals
or
to
society
from
materials
of
the
kind
which
are
suppressed
by
statutes
like
this.
i
mentioned
the
commission's
report
today
not
because
its
findings
are
necessary
to
support
our
side,
they
are
not.
the
roth-memoirs
test
and
in
the
alternative,
the
kingsley
books
v.
brown
and
freedman
cases
are
all
the
law
--
we
believe
we
need
for
reversal.
however,
the
report
is
unquestionably
the
most
important
and
authoritative
commentary
in
this
field
of
obscenity
to
have
appeared
since
the
american
law
institutes's
draft
at
a
modeled
penal
code
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
have
reference
to
it.
in
the
event,
you
should
decide
on
clearer
definitions
or
tests
should
be
introduced
in
this
or
related
cases.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
in
my
judgment,
this
case
and
this
film
provides
this
court
with
a
rare
opportunity
to
reach
a
judgment
that
is
unanimous
and
announce
a
clear
and
uniform
opinion
which
might
significantly
relieve
this
bench
and
lower
state
and
federal
courts
as
well
of
the
flood
of
litigation
and
conflicting
decisions
which
have
been
the
inevitable
prices
paid
for
the
disagreements
between
the
members
of
this
bench
and
for
a
tests
which
fail
adequately
to
be
in
touch
with
the
realities
of
sexual
attitudes,
behavior
and
expression.
i
therefore
suggest
the
court
might
wish
o
go
beyond
the
reversal
of
maryland
on
the
basis
of
roth-memoirs
or
brown-freedman
and
reverse
on
a
basis
of
a
new
formulation
which
finds
it's
common
rationale
in
a
distillation
of
the
wisdom
contained
in
the
opinions
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
manual
enterprises,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
memoirs,
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
ginzburg
and
michigan,
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
redrup,
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
memoirs,
mr.
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
stanley
and
the
chief
justice
opinion
in
rowan.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
yes,
the
rule
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
federal
agencies
and
courts
alike
would
be
admonished
not
to
obstruct
or
interfere
with
disseminations
of
films
or
any
other
materials
unless
they
are
hardcore
pornography.
but
they
would
be
given
leeway
to
prevent
or
prosecute
these
whenever
the
mode
of
their
distribution
carries
with
it
the
risk
of
exposure
to
unwilling
adults
or
to
children.
here,
may
i
remind
you
that
general
commercial
motion
picture
distributions
generally
carries
far
fewer
such
risks
that
is
of
exposure
to
children
or
to
unwilling
adults
than
general
distribution
of
books
and
magazines.
your
honors,
you
all
have
had
an
opportunity
to
see
this
film
and
to
have
experience
its
dominating
concern
with
political
and
social
and
moral
values.
its
exploration
of
personal
and
national
ethics
of
violence
and
non-violence,
of
criticism
of
american,
swedish,
russian,
chinese
and
spanish
governments,
of
youthful
reactions
to
the
war
in
vietnam
and
the
aspirations
for
a
country
which
could
adopt
the
policy
of
non-violent
defense,
of
the
ideals
of
martin
luther
king,
of
the
irresponsibility
of
some
parents
and
the
anger
of
their
children.
we
have
furnished
the
court
with
--
the
members
of
the
court
with
copies
of
the
film
scenario
so
that
you
may
be
able
if
desire
to
refresh
your
recollection
of
the
film's
social
themes
and
intellectual
ideas.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
this
film
has
been
shown
to
5.5
million
persons
in
40
states
of
the
union
and
approximately
180
cities.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
the
south
seems
to
be
a
little
more
resistant
to
the
exhibition
of
this
film
and
parts
of
the
midwest
also
than
the
north
and
the
far
west.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
people
are
going
to
see
it
all
over,
yes.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
well,
except
in
maryland.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
your
honor,
we
are
concerned.
we
were
concerned
for
the
state
of
freedom
in
this
country
for
motion
pictures.
we're
concerned
about
--
for
the
state
of
freedom
for
other
motion
pictures
that
these
appellants
might
want
to
distribute
or
exhibit
and
we're
concerned
for
the
fate
of
other
films,
books,
magazines
and
newspapers
that
it
should
be
distributed
throughout
the
country.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
mentioned
that.
we
touched
on
that
in
our
brief,
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
our
brief
on
the
merits.
i
think
that
--
i
personally
cannot
see
how
this
country
can
tolerate
a
constitution
which
gives
a
man
freedom
of
expression
or
to
receive
--
gives
a
man
freedom
to
receive
ideas
which
is
totally
dependent
on
state,
county
or
municipal
boundaries.
i
think
there
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
of
the
constitutional
laws
in
such
a
case.
i
would
like
to
say
the
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
de
grazia
distributors
and
exhibitors
under
the
laws
as
it
stands
in
this
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
didn't
hear
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i'm
sorry,
would
you
repeat
your
question?
mr.
edward
de
grazia
they
are
not
parties.
it
is
the
responsibility
for
supporting
their
rights,
and
defending
their
rights
under
the
law
of
this
land
seems
to
rest
on
the
shoulders
of
the
commercial
distributors
and
exhibitors
of
films
and
books
of
this
kind.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
it's
the
only
way
we
can
get
to
it.
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
few
minutes
--
mr.
edward
de
grazia
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
would
--
i
believe
almost
--
i
believe
entirely
because
of
litigation
which
commenced
in
those
cases
which
has
not
finally
been
resolved
in
cases
both
civil
and
criminal
which
are
pending
--
which
have
been
suspended
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
de
grazia
i
have
nothing
to
add
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
