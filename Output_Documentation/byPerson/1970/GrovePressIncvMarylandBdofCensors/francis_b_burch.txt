mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
make
apologies
at
the
outset
if
i
have
a
question
put
to
me
and
have
a
little
difficulty
in
hearing
it
and
i
just
simply
want
to
apologize
in
advance.
i
had
originally
intended
to
argue
this
case
by
addressing
myself
first
to
the
obscenity
issue
and
then
very
lightly
at
the
end
to
the
questions
raised
by
my
brother
with
respect
to
the
statute
itself,
the
whole
system
of
pre-censorship
in
maryland
and
the
question
of
preemption
by
the
second
circuit.
but
let
me,
since
he
have
made
quite
a
point
of
both
of
those
matters,
let
me
first,
if
i
may,
go
to
the
question
of
the
over
breadth
of
the
maryland
statute.
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
pointed
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
in
the
sansone
case
addressed
itself
specifically
to
that
problem
and
held
that
obscenity
was
obscenity
within
the
constitutional
sense
and
that
is
all
that
could
be
banned
by
the
maryland
censorship
board.
and
i
might
say
that
that
brings
to
mind
the
shuttlesworth
case
in
alabama
where
this
court
held
that
plastic
surgery
on
a
statute
which
would
otherwise
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
could
act
prospectively
so
that
the
surgery
would
correct
whatever
defect
there
was.
so
we
think
shuttlesworth
is
a
complete
answer
to
the
point
raised
by
my
brother
on
that
question.
with
respect
to
the
preemption,
again,
going
to
the
question
of
the
statute
itself,
my
brother
refers
to
the
kingsley
case,
the
brown
case.
i
simply
point
out
that
that
was
in
1957.
the
freedman
case
which
dealt
specifically
with
the
maryland's
system
of
pre-censorship
was
decided
in
1965
and
it's
very
much
on
point,
so
i
don't
know
why
he
would
ask
this
court
having
once
addressed
itself
to
the
maryland
statute,
having
found
that
it
could
constitutionally
be
amended
which
it
was,
sorry,
and
it
was
so
amended
that
now,
he
brings
up
the
brown
case
of
1957.
on
the
question
of
preemption
by
the
second
circuit,
first
of
all,
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
it
would
be
a
completely
new
theory
of
the
law
and
frankly,
we've
researched
it
and
we
find
nothing
which
would
suggest
that
preemption
would
be
appropriate
in
this
particular
case,
but
let's
look
at
the
facts.
first
of
all,
we
were
not
party
to
the
federal
suit
in
new
york.
there
was
no
expert
witness
offered
by
the
federal
government.
the
case
was
tried
before
a
jury.
we
had
no
right
of
appeal
so
he
would
say
that
if
a
court
in
some
other
jurisdiction
were
to
decide
the
issue
without
ever
our
having
had
any
opportunity
whatsoever
to
enforce
the
rights
of
our
statutes
that
we
should
be
preempted.
i
think
simply
to
state
the
question
is
to
answer,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
will
ever
take
such
a
position.
now,
i
can't
let
it
pass
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
obscenity,
the
description
that
my
brother
had
or
gave
of
the
sex
in
this
picture.
he
talked
about
a
few
fleeting
moments
of
a
man
in
the
nude
and
a
girl
in
the
nude.
he
says
and
he
acknowledges
that
hardcore
pornography
even
under
the
unusual
test
that
he
suggests
that
hardcore
pornography
would
be
properly
banned
by
any
jurisdiction
whether
it
be
federal
or
state.
i
would
like
,if
the
court
is
not
already
familiar
with
it,
simply
to
refer
of
the
description
of
the
17
--
in
the
--
your
honors
would
pardon
me
for
just
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
find
the
particular
reference
of
what
this
film
is
all
about.
while
i
look
for
that,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
comment
about
the
theme
of
this
movie.
there
were
some
very
interesting
characterizations
of
the
various
things,
martin
luther
king,
the
unrest
in
sweden
and
this
and
that,
and
the
other
thing,
and
that
this
therefore
gave
it
a
redeeming
social
value.
i
think
it's
interesting
if
the
court
will
recall
in
our
brief
the
reference
to
rex
reed's
critique
of
the
film
i
think
in
the
new
york
times
in
which
he
related
a
very
interesting
incident.
when
the
film
had
been
shown
to
those
who
were
going
to
write
it
to
the
critics
that
after
the
film
had
been
shown,
it
was
found
out
that
the
projectionist
had
put
the
second
reel
--
the
third
reel
second
and
the
second
reel
last.
in
other
words,
the
theme
was
so
completely
disorganized
and
that
there
really
wasn't
anything
that
they
didn't
even
know
which
film
went
where.
and
if
you
will
look
at
judge
lumbard's
opinion
in
the
new
york
case,
you
will
find
that
they
did
the
same
thing
when
that
case
--
when
that
film
was
exhibited
to
the
court
and
the
jury
because
in
his
opinion,
judge
lumbard
says
“the
final
scene
in
conformity
to
the
dominant
theme
shows
the
female
lead
performing
an
orchiectomy
or
a
episiotomy,
or
both
on
her
murdered
lover
with
a
kitchen
carving
knife.
this
happened
to
be
in
the
second
reel
and
not
in
the
third
reel,
but
when
they
showed
it
to
the
jury
and
to
the
court,
it
ended
up
but
being
in
the
third
reel.
now,
let's
look
at
what
the
sex
is
in
this
movie.
i'm
not
going
to
use
some
of
the
expressions
that
we
use
such
as
in
the
opening
scene
when
the
young
lady
talks
about
what
she
can
do
in
rio
de
janeiro
for
free,
but
you
have
a
display
of
erotic
indian
sculpture
depicting
a
man
with
his
hand
on
the
woman's
vagina.
you
have
a
discussion
between
lena
and
another
girl
about
different
methods
of
masturbation.
you
have
the
dialogue
“are
you
that
stupid,”
so
you
don't
give
a
--
you
know
what
about
it.
detailed
love
making
scene
in
lena's
room
showing
both
parties
completely
naked,
exposing
the
male
genital
area,
showing
attempted
intercourse
against
a
wall,
and
also
showing
a
scene
of
börje
caressing
the
girl's
breast
with
his
tongue.
a
scene
depicting
sexual
intercourse
between
börje
and
lena
on
the
palace
balustrade
in
which
although
the
parties
are
clothed,
the
act
of
intercourse
is
vividly
displayed.
scenes
of
nudity
at
the
retreat
and
scenes
depicting
lena
looking
at
a
sex
manual
showing
various
unusual
positions
for
sexual
intercourse.
scene
at
the
retreat
showing
börje
throwing
lena
to
the
ground
and
committing
an
act
of
cunnilingus
followed
by
a
scene
depicting
the
parties
both
completely
nude
with
lena
kissing
börje's
penis
as
he
caresses
her
vagina.
a
discussion
regarding
sex
which
makes
both
of
them
horny.
scenes
depicting
intercourse
in
the
water,
scenes
depicting
sexual
intercourse
in
a
tree
between
lena
and
börje,
scenes
showing
fully
the
naked
bodies
of
the
two
lying
on
the
floor
engaged
in
either
actual
sodomy
or
sexual
intercourse
with
the
man
behind
the
woman.
this
scene
also
dramatically
emphasizes
the
erotic
effects
of
the
copulation.
i
could
go
one
and
i
could
talk
about
the
genitals
in
other
scenes,
i
could
talk
about
the
tremendous
active
scene
when
he
chases
her
into
another
room,
throws
her
to
the
floor
and
has
what
appears
to
be
intercourse
in
the
nude.
throughout
this
picture,
you
have
ten
or
twelve
minutes
of
sexuality,
but
it's
the
most
explicit
sexuality
that's
ever
been
shown.
you
also
have
in
the
record
the
statement
of
the
producer
that
what
he
sent
over
here
to
the
united
states
to
grove
press
as
the
material
that
would
be
used
to
sell
the
picture
was
mostly
the
emphasis
on
the
sexual
aspect
of
the
film.
all
of
these
is
the
dominant
theme
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
lower
court
in
our
case,
it
was
held
by
the
lower
court
by
the
jury
in
the
new
york
case,
it
was
held
by
the
lower
court
in
the
new
york
case,
it
was
held
by
one
of
the
two
judges
in
the
second
circuit.
it
was
held
by
the
lower
court
in
our
case
and
it
was
held
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
divided
four
to
three
opinion.
it
was
also
held
by
a
number
of
other
cases,
courts
throughout
the
country
that
had
had
the
opportunity
to
address
itself
to
the
issue.
they
have
found
that
this
is
a
predominantly
sexual
obscene
picture
and
that
it
has
no
redeeming
social
value.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
--
do
you
have
the
--
we
recite
in
our
brief
the
number
of
cases
where
it
has
been
held
to
be
obscene,
where
it
has
been
held
to
be
hardcore
pornography
and
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
the
sex
in
here
is
only
to
sell
the
film,
the
rest
of
it
is
nothing.
the
“i
am
curious
blue”
case;
this
picture
was
developed
by
a
series
of
interviews
such
as
you
see
lena
conducting
on
the
street
and
what
not.
they
took
all
of
that,
they
extracted
from
it,
that
which
they
wanted
to
put
in
“i
am
curious
yellow”
with
about
95%
of
the
sex
that
they've
seen
--
that
they
filmed.
they
put
that
together
and
they
sold
“i
am
curious
yellow.”
then
they
came
along
with
“i
am
curious
blue”
and
what
a
disappointment
to
those
who
we're
looking
for
sex
because
if
--
it
reminded
me
of
the
comment
by
mr.
justice
stewart
or
mr.
justice
goldberg
who
said
that
the
--
in
the
lover's
case,
jacobellis'
case
that
the
sex
in
it
was
so
fleeting
that
you
would've
known
it
except
how
you've
been
censored.
in
this
case,
this
is
exactly
what
they
did
and
they
ended
up
with
“i
am
curious
blue”
and
what
happened?
5.5
million
people
have
gone
to
see
“i
am
curious
yellow”
according
to
my
brother.
in
40
states
it
has
been
shown
in.
it
was
at
the
top
of
the
box
office.
i'd
tell
you,
i've
gone
all
over
those
figures.
it
was
in
the
top
ten
--
top
two
or
three
in
the
country
for
four
or
five
weeks
running.
along
came
on
“i
am
curious
blue”,
no
sex,
the
same
types
have
been
used,
the
same
depiction
of
unrest
and
social
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing,
and
what
happened
in
about
four
or
five
weeks,
it's
fallen
flat
on
its
face
and
i
doubt
very
seriously
whether
it's
being
shown
in
the
other
states
in
the
county
today.
why,
because
it
has
no
theme,
it
has
no
social
redeeming
value
and
it
has
no
sex.
if
it
had
the
sex
that
“i
am
curious
yellow”
had,
it
would
also
probably
be
seen
by
the
same
number
of
people
if
they
continued
to
show
it
as
they
have
in
the
past.
so
it
is
now
against
me
to
the
part
of
the
argument
of
addressing
myself
to
what
is
the
state
of
the
law
on
this
whole
question
and
i
agree
is
confusing.
i
agree
that
it's
very
difficult
to
read
the
opinions
in
these
cases,
i
have
been
trying
to
make
a
summary
of
what
each
of
the
justices
in
the
last
15
years
have
done
in
the
various
cases
and
quite
frankly,
and
i
say
it
with
some
apology,
there
is
really
no
complete
consistency
among
the
views
of
the
justices
and
among
some
of
the
justices'
own
views.
they
say
one
thing
one
time,
they
say
something
else
another
time
and
they
come
back
and
they
end
up
with
a
somewhat
different
view
that
they
had
even
the
second
time.
and
again,
i
say
it
with
apology,
but
this
is
really
the
problem
and
i
think
the
court
recognized
the
problem,
i
think
the
court
sees
that
it
has
to
resolve
the
problem.
now,
throughout
the
country
today,
all
of
the
courts
are
viewing
the
whole
question
of
obscenity
with
the
three-prong
test
as
being
the
applicable
test.
while
i
have
read
every
case
on
this
subject
and
i
have
yet
to
find
where
a
majority
of
the
court
has
agreed
on
the
three-prong
test,
the
majority
of
any
court
has
agreed
on
the
three-pronged
test.
mr.
justice
brennan
introduced
the
three-prong
test
in
memoirs
and
came
out
with
the
socially
utterly
without
social
redeeming
value.
but
there
hasn't
been
majority
of
the
court
that
has
subscribed
to
this
as
the
viable
concept
and
the
principle
that
shall
be
applied
in
decision
such
as
this.
what
is
the
test?
i
think
the
answer
is
what
mr.
justice
harlan
has
suggested
and
which
i
believe
has
been
generally
adopted
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
to
somewhat
lesser
extent
by
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
that
we've
got
to
let
the
state
if
they
use
a
rational
basis
in
making
a
determination,
we
have
got
to
let
the
states
determine
what
is
obscene
and
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
that
particular
statute.
this
is
the
only
way
we're
going
to
make
any
sense
out
of
it
and
it's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
end
up
the
clogging
of
the
courts
with
these
cases
coming
in
day
in
and
day
out
all
over
the
united
states
whether
we're
talking
about
federal
courts
or
whether
we're
talking
about
state
courts,
whether
we're
talking
at
the
lower
level
or
whether
we're
talking
at
the
appellate
level.
we
have
today
the
greatest
backlog
in
cases
in
the
criminal
field
throughout
all
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
because
of
the
inability
of
the
court
to
come
to
some
reasonable
definition
of
what
constitutes
obscenity
that
the
states
have
a
right
to
control,
because
of
that,
we
are
causing
all
of
these
criminals
or
these
ones
that
have
been
charged
with
being
criminal
to
languish
in
jail
waiting
for
these
other
cases
to
be
heard
and
to
be
tried.
quite
frankly,
i
know
that
some
will
criticize
me
for
what
i'm
about
to
say,
but
i
would
rather
see
the
whole
law
abolished
than
to
have
this
state
of
confusion
continue.
i
think
it
serves
no
good
purpose.
i
think
however
that
the
public
has
a
right
based
upon
the
acts
of
the
legislature
to
have
some
protection
in
the
field
of
obscenity.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
it
has
to.
in
roth,
it
said
that
obscenity
is
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
believe
it
is
correct,
i
believe
it
will
be
a
sad
day
if
it
is
ever
the
view
of
this
court
that
obscenity
can
run
rampant
and
nobody
can
do
anything
about
it.
now,
let's
talk
for
a
minute
about
the
difference
between
censorship
in
books,
obscenity
in
books
and
obscenities
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
just
saying
that
there
are
144
cases
dealing
with
“i
am
curious
yellow”
throughout
the
united
states
right
now.
this
is
by
the
brief
of
my
brother
here.
we
have
maybe
three
or
four
or
five
cases
a
year
that
may
come
up
when
you
go
to
the
courts
which
then
have
to
go
through
the
process
of
the
appellate
court
then
come
up
here
to
the
supreme
court.
aside
from
anything
else
on
the
great
constitutional
questions
dealing
with
other
first
amendment
rights
for
this
court,
obscenity
cases
seem
to
me
to
have
taken
up
a
good
part
of
this
court's
time.
i'd
be
hopeful
that
this
court
might
be
able
to
come
up
with
a
definition
and
quite
frankly
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
subscribe
to
your
approach
to
the
problem
because
i
think
it's
the
reasonable
one.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
it's
determined
by
a
judicially
--
a
state
court
that
on
a
reasonable
basis
that
the
particular
matter
is
obscene
then
on
the
sufficient
evidence
rule,
that
would
be
permitted
to
stand.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
they
--
if
it
is
--
if
after
there
is
reasonable
[voice
overlap]
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
there
has
been
a
reasonable
basis,
there's
an
evidence
introduced
as
to
the
nature
of
the
sexuality,
as
to
the
experts
if
you
must
have
experts
say
that
there
is
a
predominantly
prurient
theme.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
i'm
sure
wouldn't
use
the
experts
that
my
brother
has
used
in
the
“i
am
curious
yellow”.
we
used
them
--
we
have
people
who
are
professors,
who
have
studied
in
the
arts
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
at
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
at
john
hopkins
university,
psychologist.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
psychologist.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
would
like
to
see
somebody
who
represents
the
community
as
distinguished
from
somebody
who
is
a
man
of
letters.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
there
are
about
some
210
million
that
may
well
be
upset
by
what
has
been
done
and
i
don't
say
that
every
--
of
those
--
one
of
those
5.5
million
attended
that
movie
for
sex
and
many
other
i'm
sure
walked
in
without
the
realization
what
it
was,
others
i'm
sure
went
out
of
curiosity
and
many
of
them
who
came
out
were
disgusted
and
probably
would
never
go
back
to
see
a
picture
like
that
again.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
maybe
true
but
those
people
who
walk
in
as
that
theater
is
a
semi--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
do
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
believe
in
everybody
having
their
rights
within
reasonable
bounds.
i
believe
that
everybody
should
have
the
right
to
read
what
they
want
to
read
in
their
own
and
i
agree
100%
with
stanley.
but
i
do
not
agree
that
the
public
should
have
forced
it
upon
it's
sensitivities
that
which
somebody
wants
to
see
themselves
in
a
public
or
semipublic
place.
that's
why
i
think
there's
a
distinction.
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
say
this
with
some
respect
sir.
i
believe
that
even
under
your
own
principle
that
this
film
can
be
barred
because
you
say
that
censorship
is
permissible
where
there
is
--
or
where
it
is
brigaded
with
illegal
action.
and
i
say
that
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
concurring
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
conduct,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
say
this
is
conduct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me
sir?
i
didn't
hear
you
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
was
the
point
i
was
about
to
address
myself
to.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
exactly
that.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
my
question.
i'd
like
to
answer
it
by
posing
the
question.
suppose
we
were
in
a
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
there's
no
difference
except
maybe
the
body
of
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
that
if
in
a
public
place
or
a
semipublic
place
there
is
obscene
conduct,
i
see
no
distinction
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
copulation,
homosexuality,
lesbianism,
i
call
that
obscene.
if
that's
not
obscene,
mr.
justice
stewart
says
he
can't
define
pornography
but
he
knows
it
when
he
sees
it.
and
i
could
tell
you
that
he
referred
to
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
very
acts
we're
talking
about
in
“i
am
curious
yellow”
are
the
very
acts
which
we've
referred
to
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
in
which
the
justice
potter
stewart
gave
--
made
reference
to
when
he
said
i
know
a
pornography
when
i
see
it.
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
and
i
don't
think
any
person
knows
it.
those
who
want
to
close
their
eyes
to
it
and
say
it
doesn't
exist,
no.
those
who
want
to
sell
their
spot,
no.
it
doesn't
exist.
it's
not
pornography.
it's
not
obscene.
it's
just
a
freedom
of
expression
or
freedom
of
somebody
to
do
what
he
wants
to
do
when
he
wants
to
do
it
and
society
be
damned.
but
my
point
is
let's
go
into
that
theater
where
this
movie
is
being
shown.
let's
have
a
couple
sitting
there
copulating
in
the
isle.
are
they
going
to
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
obscenity,
for
lewdness?
if
they
are,
would
their
first
amendment
rights
be
denied
because
they
were
in
a
place
where
there
was
a
little
privacy
that
didn't
have
to
go
in
there
in
the
first
place?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
the
counsel
in
the
case
who
argued
memoirs
has
written
a
book
and
he
made
quite
a
bit
to
do
about
how
he
addressed
this
court
on
the
so
called
parade
of
horribles.
he
said
that
he
could
see
that
members
of
this
court
would
not
buy
the
possibility
that
these
other
things
could
happen
so
that
what
he
did
was
he
devised
his
argument
to
say
that
what
applies
to
a
book
obviously
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
a
movie
or
apply
to
conduct.
it
doesn't
apply
to
what
you'll
show
in
your
home
on
television,
but
we've
given
them
an
inch.
they
haven't
taken
a
mile,
they've
taken
the
proverbial
20
leagues
and
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
because
if
this
court
says
that
this
kind
of
stuff
can't
be
shown
indiscriminately
in
the
movies,
i'm
telling
you
that
you're
going
to
have
people
that
are
going
to
be
able
to
live
acts
of
sexual
intercourse
down
in
the
block
in
baltimore
city
or
down
in
bourbon
street
in
new
orleans,
or
in
other
places
of
like
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
say
that
i
can
see
that
as
an
logical
extension
of
the
argument,
yes,
i
can
see
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
pray
to
god
it
would
never
come
to
pass.
but
i
could
see
that
it
would
logically
happen,
it
could
logically.
because
basically,
what
is
the
difference
between
live
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
a
portrayal
of
it
with
music
and
all
of
the
other
with
a
living
color
and
what
not
on
the
other
on
the
screen.
it
maybe
even
far
more
sexually
stimulating
to
see
it
with
all
of
the
adornments
that
you
would
have
with
the
technical
color
and
the
music
and
as
i
said
before,
far
more
so
than
seeing
somebody
sitting
at
the
park,
engaging
in
some
form
of
sexual
activity.
is
it
possible?
yes,
it's
possible.
this
is
what
i'm
saying
that
i
see
this
is
a
logical
extension.
i
have
seen
with
all
apologies
again
to
the
court,
i
have
been
at
the
bar
for
27
years,
i
have
seen
the
extension
of
doctrines
who
later
along
--
today's
test
is
not
tomorrows.
you
don't
measure
today
against
what
happened
yesterday
or
what
happened
a
year
ago.
you
measure
it
against
what
happened
yesterday.
that
now
becomes
a
new
test.
then
you
go
over
here
and
you
got
the
new
test
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
first
thing
you
know,
you're
diametrically
at
opposite
poles.
this
is
what
i
say
can
and
this
is
what
i
say
might
well
happen.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
not
saying
i
want
you
to
straighten
anything
else
up
other
than
this
particular
matter
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
like
we
have
in
the
trial
of
criminal
cases
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
as
i
believe
former
chief
justice
warren
and
mr.
justice
clark
suggested
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
as
i
believe
it's
the
view
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
might
well
be
mr.
justice
white's
view
that
i
think
that
if
that
is
established
at
least,
we
put
to
rest
unless
there
is
clear
air
as
long
as
there
is
a
substantial
basis
--
amount
of
evidence
to
support
the
finding
that
then
the
banning
of
the
particular
law
might
apply.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
seven.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
seven
and
five
sitting
--
generally
only
five
sit
there,
they're
rotating.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
everything
in
life
has
got
to
be
based
upon
somebody's
judgment
evaluation.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
de
grazia
was
making
a
great
part
that
there
we're
two
justices
--
judges
in
new
york
against
one
but
if
i
got
that
jury
of
12
that
held
that
this
was
obscene
and
that
it
offended
temporary
community
standards
and
that
it
was
without
redeeming
social
value,
all
of
these
people
found
it
was
bad.
but
two
judges
against
one
said
it
was
all
right
and
with
all
due
respect
again
to
this
court,
this
court
acts
as
the
ultimate
censor.
you're
putting
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
community
and
i've
heard
other
members
of
this
court
criticize
the
fact
that
this
is
happening.
and
i
heard
mr.
--
i
read
mr.
justice
brennan
say
unless
don't
talk
about
super
censors,
but
then
i
read
other
opinions
that
say
that
this
is
what
this
court
is.
it's
a
super
censor
and
as
long
as
you're
going
to
be
a
super
censor,
you're
going
to
end
up
by
having
yourself
completely
choked
by
the
mass
of
cases
that
are
going
to
continue
to
come
before
or
unless
you,
if
i
may
that
i
won't
use
the
expression,
but
you
know
that
confucius
once
said
that
unless
you
--
unless
you
just
suddenly
realized
that
you're
going
to
throw
everything
to
the
winds
and
let
it
happen,
this
is
what
you're
faced
with.
in
the
continual
of
--
i'm
sorry,
i
hope
i
tried
to
address
myself
to
some
of
the
problems
that
the
court
is
having.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
make
apologies
at
the
outset
if
i
have
a
question
put
to
me
and
have
a
little
difficulty
in
hearing
it
and
i
just
simply
want
to
apologize
in
advance.
i
had
originally
intended
to
argue
this
case
by
addressing
myself
first
to
the
obscenity
issue
and
then
very
lightly
at
the
end
to
the
questions
raised
by
my
brother
with
respect
to
the
statute
itself,
the
whole
system
of
pre-censorship
in
maryland
and
the
question
of
preemption
by
the
second
circuit.
but
let
me,
since
he
have
made
quite
a
point
of
both
of
those
matters,
let
me
first,
if
i
may,
go
to
the
question
of
the
over
breadth
of
the
maryland
statute.
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
pointed
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
in
the
sansone
case
addressed
itself
specifically
to
that
problem
and
held
that
obscenity
was
obscenity
within
the
constitutional
sense
and
that
is
all
that
could
be
banned
by
the
maryland
censorship
board.
and
i
might
say
that
that
brings
to
mind
the
shuttlesworth
case
in
alabama
where
this
court
held
that
plastic
surgery
on
a
statute
which
would
otherwise
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
could
act
prospectively
so
that
the
surgery
would
correct
whatever
defect
there
was.
so
we
think
shuttlesworth
is
a
complete
answer
to
the
point
raised
by
my
brother
on
that
question.
with
respect
to
the
preemption,
again,
going
to
the
question
of
the
statute
itself,
my
brother
refers
to
the
kingsley
case,
the
brown
case.
i
simply
point
out
that
that
was
in
1957.
the
freedman
case
which
dealt
specifically
with
the
maryland's
system
of
pre-censorship
was
decided
in
1965
and
it's
very
much
on
point,
so
i
don't
know
why
he
would
ask
this
court
having
once
addressed
itself
to
the
maryland
statute,
having
found
that
it
could
constitutionally
be
amended
which
it
was,
sorry,
and
it
was
so
amended
that
now,
he
brings
up
the
brown
case
of
1957.
on
the
question
of
preemption
by
the
second
circuit,
first
of
all,
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
it
would
be
a
completely
new
theory
of
the
law
and
frankly,
we've
researched
it
and
we
find
nothing
which
would
suggest
that
preemption
would
be
appropriate
in
this
particular
case,
but
let's
look
at
the
facts.
first
of
all,
we
were
not
party
to
the
federal
suit
in
new
york.
there
was
no
expert
witness
offered
by
the
federal
government.
the
case
was
tried
before
a
jury.
we
had
no
right
of
appeal
so
he
would
say
that
if
a
court
in
some
other
jurisdiction
were
to
decide
the
issue
without
ever
our
having
had
any
opportunity
whatsoever
to
enforce
the
rights
of
our
statutes
that
we
should
be
preempted.
i
think
simply
to
state
the
question
is
to
answer,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
will
ever
take
such
a
position.
now,
i
can't
let
it
pass
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
obscenity,
the
description
that
my
brother
had
or
gave
of
the
sex
in
this
picture.
he
talked
about
a
few
fleeting
moments
of
a
man
in
the
nude
and
a
girl
in
the
nude.
he
says
and
he
acknowledges
that
hardcore
pornography
even
under
the
unusual
test
that
he
suggests
that
hardcore
pornography
would
be
properly
banned
by
any
jurisdiction
whether
it
be
federal
or
state.
i
would
like
,if
the
court
is
not
already
familiar
with
it,
simply
to
refer
of
the
description
of
the
17
--
in
the
--
your
honors
would
pardon
me
for
just
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
find
the
particular
reference
of
what
this
film
is
all
about.
while
i
look
for
that,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
comment
about
the
theme
of
this
movie.
there
were
some
very
interesting
characterizations
of
the
various
things,
martin
luther
king,
the
unrest
in
sweden
and
this
and
that,
and
the
other
thing,
and
that
this
therefore
gave
it
a
redeeming
social
value.
i
think
it's
interesting
if
the
court
will
recall
in
our
brief
the
reference
to
rex
reed's
critique
of
the
film
i
think
in
the
new
york
times
in
which
he
related
a
very
interesting
incident.
when
the
film
had
been
shown
to
those
who
were
going
to
write
it
to
the
critics
that
after
the
film
had
been
shown,
it
was
found
out
that
the
projectionist
had
put
the
second
reel
--
the
third
reel
second
and
the
second
reel
last.
in
other
words,
the
theme
was
so
completely
disorganized
and
that
there
really
wasn't
anything
that
they
didn't
even
know
which
film
went
where.
and
if
you
will
look
at
judge
lumbard's
opinion
in
the
new
york
case,
you
will
find
that
they
did
the
same
thing
when
that
case
--
when
that
film
was
exhibited
to
the
court
and
the
jury
because
in
his
opinion,
judge
lumbard
says
“the
final
scene
in
conformity
to
the
dominant
theme
shows
the
female
lead
performing
an
orchiectomy
or
a
episiotomy,
or
both
on
her
murdered
lover
with
a
kitchen
carving
knife.
this
happened
to
be
in
the
second
reel
and
not
in
the
third
reel,
but
when
they
showed
it
to
the
jury
and
to
the
court,
it
ended
up
but
being
in
the
third
reel.
now,
let's
look
at
what
the
sex
is
in
this
movie.
i'm
not
going
to
use
some
of
the
expressions
that
we
use
such
as
in
the
opening
scene
when
the
young
lady
talks
about
what
she
can
do
in
rio
de
janeiro
for
free,
but
you
have
a
display
of
erotic
indian
sculpture
depicting
a
man
with
his
hand
on
the
woman's
vagina.
you
have
a
discussion
between
lena
and
another
girl
about
different
methods
of
masturbation.
you
have
the
dialogue
“are
you
that
stupid,”
so
you
don't
give
a
--
you
know
what
about
it.
detailed
love
making
scene
in
lena's
room
showing
both
parties
completely
naked,
exposing
the
male
genital
area,
showing
attempted
intercourse
against
a
wall,
and
also
showing
a
scene
of
börje
caressing
the
girl's
breast
with
his
tongue.
a
scene
depicting
sexual
intercourse
between
börje
and
lena
on
the
palace
balustrade
in
which
although
the
parties
are
clothed,
the
act
of
intercourse
is
vividly
displayed.
scenes
of
nudity
at
the
retreat
and
scenes
depicting
lena
looking
at
a
sex
manual
showing
various
unusual
positions
for
sexual
intercourse.
scene
at
the
retreat
showing
börje
throwing
lena
to
the
ground
and
committing
an
act
of
cunnilingus
followed
by
a
scene
depicting
the
parties
both
completely
nude
with
lena
kissing
börje's
penis
as
he
caresses
her
vagina.
a
discussion
regarding
sex
which
makes
both
of
them
horny.
scenes
depicting
intercourse
in
the
water,
scenes
depicting
sexual
intercourse
in
a
tree
between
lena
and
börje,
scenes
showing
fully
the
naked
bodies
of
the
two
lying
on
the
floor
engaged
in
either
actual
sodomy
or
sexual
intercourse
with
the
man
behind
the
woman.
this
scene
also
dramatically
emphasizes
the
erotic
effects
of
the
copulation.
i
could
go
one
and
i
could
talk
about
the
genitals
in
other
scenes,
i
could
talk
about
the
tremendous
active
scene
when
he
chases
her
into
another
room,
throws
her
to
the
floor
and
has
what
appears
to
be
intercourse
in
the
nude.
throughout
this
picture,
you
have
ten
or
twelve
minutes
of
sexuality,
but
it's
the
most
explicit
sexuality
that's
ever
been
shown.
you
also
have
in
the
record
the
statement
of
the
producer
that
what
he
sent
over
here
to
the
united
states
to
grove
press
as
the
material
that
would
be
used
to
sell
the
picture
was
mostly
the
emphasis
on
the
sexual
aspect
of
the
film.
all
of
these
is
the
dominant
theme
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
lower
court
in
our
case,
it
was
held
by
the
lower
court
by
the
jury
in
the
new
york
case,
it
was
held
by
the
lower
court
in
the
new
york
case,
it
was
held
by
one
of
the
two
judges
in
the
second
circuit.
it
was
held
by
the
lower
court
in
our
case
and
it
was
held
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
divided
four
to
three
opinion.
it
was
also
held
by
a
number
of
other
cases,
courts
throughout
the
country
that
had
had
the
opportunity
to
address
itself
to
the
issue.
they
have
found
that
this
is
a
predominantly
sexual
obscene
picture
and
that
it
has
no
redeeming
social
value.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
--
do
you
have
the
--
we
recite
in
our
brief
the
number
of
cases
where
it
has
been
held
to
be
obscene,
where
it
has
been
held
to
be
hardcore
pornography
and
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
the
sex
in
here
is
only
to
sell
the
film,
the
rest
of
it
is
nothing.
the
“i
am
curious
blue”
case;
this
picture
was
developed
by
a
series
of
interviews
such
as
you
see
lena
conducting
on
the
street
and
what
not.
they
took
all
of
that,
they
extracted
from
it,
that
which
they
wanted
to
put
in
“i
am
curious
yellow”
with
about
95%
of
the
sex
that
they've
seen
--
that
they
filmed.
they
put
that
together
and
they
sold
“i
am
curious
yellow.”
then
they
came
along
with
“i
am
curious
blue”
and
what
a
disappointment
to
those
who
we're
looking
for
sex
because
if
--
it
reminded
me
of
the
comment
by
mr.
justice
stewart
or
mr.
justice
goldberg
who
said
that
the
--
in
the
lover's
case,
jacobellis'
case
that
the
sex
in
it
was
so
fleeting
that
you
would've
known
it
except
how
you've
been
censored.
in
this
case,
this
is
exactly
what
they
did
and
they
ended
up
with
“i
am
curious
blue”
and
what
happened?
5.5
million
people
have
gone
to
see
“i
am
curious
yellow”
according
to
my
brother.
in
40
states
it
has
been
shown
in.
it
was
at
the
top
of
the
box
office.
i'd
tell
you,
i've
gone
all
over
those
figures.
it
was
in
the
top
ten
--
top
two
or
three
in
the
country
for
four
or
five
weeks
running.
along
came
on
“i
am
curious
blue”,
no
sex,
the
same
types
have
been
used,
the
same
depiction
of
unrest
and
social
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing,
and
what
happened
in
about
four
or
five
weeks,
it's
fallen
flat
on
its
face
and
i
doubt
very
seriously
whether
it's
being
shown
in
the
other
states
in
the
county
today.
why,
because
it
has
no
theme,
it
has
no
social
redeeming
value
and
it
has
no
sex.
if
it
had
the
sex
that
“i
am
curious
yellow”
had,
it
would
also
probably
be
seen
by
the
same
number
of
people
if
they
continued
to
show
it
as
they
have
in
the
past.
so
it
is
now
against
me
to
the
part
of
the
argument
of
addressing
myself
to
what
is
the
state
of
the
law
on
this
whole
question
and
i
agree
is
confusing.
i
agree
that
it's
very
difficult
to
read
the
opinions
in
these
cases,
i
have
been
trying
to
make
a
summary
of
what
each
of
the
justices
in
the
last
15
years
have
done
in
the
various
cases
and
quite
frankly,
and
i
say
it
with
some
apology,
there
is
really
no
complete
consistency
among
the
views
of
the
justices
and
among
some
of
the
justices'
own
views.
they
say
one
thing
one
time,
they
say
something
else
another
time
and
they
come
back
and
they
end
up
with
a
somewhat
different
view
that
they
had
even
the
second
time.
and
again,
i
say
it
with
apology,
but
this
is
really
the
problem
and
i
think
the
court
recognized
the
problem,
i
think
the
court
sees
that
it
has
to
resolve
the
problem.
now,
throughout
the
country
today,
all
of
the
courts
are
viewing
the
whole
question
of
obscenity
with
the
three-prong
test
as
being
the
applicable
test.
while
i
have
read
every
case
on
this
subject
and
i
have
yet
to
find
where
a
majority
of
the
court
has
agreed
on
the
three-prong
test,
the
majority
of
any
court
has
agreed
on
the
three-pronged
test.
mr.
justice
brennan
introduced
the
three-prong
test
in
memoirs
and
came
out
with
the
socially
utterly
without
social
redeeming
value.
but
there
hasn't
been
majority
of
the
court
that
has
subscribed
to
this
as
the
viable
concept
and
the
principle
that
shall
be
applied
in
decision
such
as
this.
what
is
the
test?
i
think
the
answer
is
what
mr.
justice
harlan
has
suggested
and
which
i
believe
has
been
generally
adopted
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
to
somewhat
lesser
extent
by
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
that
we've
got
to
let
the
state
if
they
use
a
rational
basis
in
making
a
determination,
we
have
got
to
let
the
states
determine
what
is
obscene
and
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
that
particular
statute.
this
is
the
only
way
we're
going
to
make
any
sense
out
of
it
and
it's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
end
up
the
clogging
of
the
courts
with
these
cases
coming
in
day
in
and
day
out
all
over
the
united
states
whether
we're
talking
about
federal
courts
or
whether
we're
talking
about
state
courts,
whether
we're
talking
at
the
lower
level
or
whether
we're
talking
at
the
appellate
level.
we
have
today
the
greatest
backlog
in
cases
in
the
criminal
field
throughout
all
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
because
of
the
inability
of
the
court
to
come
to
some
reasonable
definition
of
what
constitutes
obscenity
that
the
states
have
a
right
to
control,
because
of
that,
we
are
causing
all
of
these
criminals
or
these
ones
that
have
been
charged
with
being
criminal
to
languish
in
jail
waiting
for
these
other
cases
to
be
heard
and
to
be
tried.
quite
frankly,
i
know
that
some
will
criticize
me
for
what
i'm
about
to
say,
but
i
would
rather
see
the
whole
law
abolished
than
to
have
this
state
of
confusion
continue.
i
think
it
serves
no
good
purpose.
i
think
however
that
the
public
has
a
right
based
upon
the
acts
of
the
legislature
to
have
some
protection
in
the
field
of
obscenity.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
it
has
to.
in
roth,
it
said
that
obscenity
is
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
believe
it
is
correct,
i
believe
it
will
be
a
sad
day
if
it
is
ever
the
view
of
this
court
that
obscenity
can
run
rampant
and
nobody
can
do
anything
about
it.
now,
let's
talk
for
a
minute
about
the
difference
between
censorship
in
books,
obscenity
in
books
and
obscenities
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
just
saying
that
there
are
144
cases
dealing
with
“i
am
curious
yellow”
throughout
the
united
states
right
now.
this
is
by
the
brief
of
my
brother
here.
we
have
maybe
three
or
four
or
five
cases
a
year
that
may
come
up
when
you
go
to
the
courts
which
then
have
to
go
through
the
process
of
the
appellate
court
then
come
up
here
to
the
supreme
court.
aside
from
anything
else
on
the
great
constitutional
questions
dealing
with
other
first
amendment
rights
for
this
court,
obscenity
cases
seem
to
me
to
have
taken
up
a
good
part
of
this
court's
time.
i'd
be
hopeful
that
this
court
might
be
able
to
come
up
with
a
definition
and
quite
frankly
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
subscribe
to
your
approach
to
the
problem
because
i
think
it's
the
reasonable
one.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
it's
determined
by
a
judicially
--
a
state
court
that
on
a
reasonable
basis
that
the
particular
matter
is
obscene
then
on
the
sufficient
evidence
rule,
that
would
be
permitted
to
stand.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
they
--
if
it
is
--
if
after
there
is
reasonable
[voice
overlap]
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
there
has
been
a
reasonable
basis,
there's
an
evidence
introduced
as
to
the
nature
of
the
sexuality,
as
to
the
experts
if
you
must
have
experts
say
that
there
is
a
predominantly
prurient
theme.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
i'm
sure
wouldn't
use
the
experts
that
my
brother
has
used
in
the
“i
am
curious
yellow”.
we
used
them
--
we
have
people
who
are
professors,
who
have
studied
in
the
arts
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
at
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
at
john
hopkins
university,
psychologist.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
psychologist.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
would
like
to
see
somebody
who
represents
the
community
as
distinguished
from
somebody
who
is
a
man
of
letters.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
there
are
about
some
210
million
that
may
well
be
upset
by
what
has
been
done
and
i
don't
say
that
every
--
of
those
--
one
of
those
5.5
million
attended
that
movie
for
sex
and
many
other
i'm
sure
walked
in
without
the
realization
what
it
was,
others
i'm
sure
went
out
of
curiosity
and
many
of
them
who
came
out
were
disgusted
and
probably
would
never
go
back
to
see
a
picture
like
that
again.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
maybe
true
but
those
people
who
walk
in
as
that
theater
is
a
semi--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
do
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
believe
in
everybody
having
their
rights
within
reasonable
bounds.
i
believe
that
everybody
should
have
the
right
to
read
what
they
want
to
read
in
their
own
and
i
agree
100%
with
stanley.
but
i
do
not
agree
that
the
public
should
have
forced
it
upon
it's
sensitivities
that
which
somebody
wants
to
see
themselves
in
a
public
or
semipublic
place.
that's
why
i
think
there's
a
distinction.
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
say
this
with
some
respect
sir.
i
believe
that
even
under
your
own
principle
that
this
film
can
be
barred
because
you
say
that
censorship
is
permissible
where
there
is
--
or
where
it
is
brigaded
with
illegal
action.
and
i
say
that
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
concurring
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
conduct,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
say
this
is
conduct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me
sir?
i
didn't
hear
you
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
was
the
point
i
was
about
to
address
myself
to.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
exactly
that.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
my
question.
i'd
like
to
answer
it
by
posing
the
question.
suppose
we
were
in
a
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
there's
no
difference
except
maybe
the
body
of
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
that
if
in
a
public
place
or
a
semipublic
place
there
is
obscene
conduct,
i
see
no
distinction
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
copulation,
homosexuality,
lesbianism,
i
call
that
obscene.
if
that's
not
obscene,
mr.
justice
stewart
says
he
can't
define
pornography
but
he
knows
it
when
he
sees
it.
and
i
could
tell
you
that
he
referred
to
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
very
acts
we're
talking
about
in
“i
am
curious
yellow”
are
the
very
acts
which
we've
referred
to
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
in
which
the
justice
potter
stewart
gave
--
made
reference
to
when
he
said
i
know
a
pornography
when
i
see
it.
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
and
i
don't
think
any
person
knows
it.
those
who
want
to
close
their
eyes
to
it
and
say
it
doesn't
exist,
no.
those
who
want
to
sell
their
spot,
no.
it
doesn't
exist.
it's
not
pornography.
it's
not
obscene.
it's
just
a
freedom
of
expression
or
freedom
of
somebody
to
do
what
he
wants
to
do
when
he
wants
to
do
it
and
society
be
damned.
but
my
point
is
let's
go
into
that
theater
where
this
movie
is
being
shown.
let's
have
a
couple
sitting
there
copulating
in
the
isle.
are
they
going
to
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
obscenity,
for
lewdness?
if
they
are,
would
their
first
amendment
rights
be
denied
because
they
were
in
a
place
where
there
was
a
little
privacy
that
didn't
have
to
go
in
there
in
the
first
place?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
the
counsel
in
the
case
who
argued
memoirs
has
written
a
book
and
he
made
quite
a
bit
to
do
about
how
he
addressed
this
court
on
the
so
called
parade
of
horribles.
he
said
that
he
could
see
that
members
of
this
court
would
not
buy
the
possibility
that
these
other
things
could
happen
so
that
what
he
did
was
he
devised
his
argument
to
say
that
what
applies
to
a
book
obviously
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
a
movie
or
apply
to
conduct.
it
doesn't
apply
to
what
you'll
show
in
your
home
on
television,
but
we've
given
them
an
inch.
they
haven't
taken
a
mile,
they've
taken
the
proverbial
20
leagues
and
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
because
if
this
court
says
that
this
kind
of
stuff
can't
be
shown
indiscriminately
in
the
movies,
i'm
telling
you
that
you're
going
to
have
people
that
are
going
to
be
able
to
live
acts
of
sexual
intercourse
down
in
the
block
in
baltimore
city
or
down
in
bourbon
street
in
new
orleans,
or
in
other
places
of
like
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
say
that
i
can
see
that
as
an
logical
extension
of
the
argument,
yes,
i
can
see
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
pray
to
god
it
would
never
come
to
pass.
but
i
could
see
that
it
would
logically
happen,
it
could
logically.
because
basically,
what
is
the
difference
between
live
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
a
portrayal
of
it
with
music
and
all
of
the
other
with
a
living
color
and
what
not
on
the
other
on
the
screen.
it
maybe
even
far
more
sexually
stimulating
to
see
it
with
all
of
the
adornments
that
you
would
have
with
the
technical
color
and
the
music
and
as
i
said
before,
far
more
so
than
seeing
somebody
sitting
at
the
park,
engaging
in
some
form
of
sexual
activity.
is
it
possible?
yes,
it's
possible.
this
is
what
i'm
saying
that
i
see
this
is
a
logical
extension.
i
have
seen
with
all
apologies
again
to
the
court,
i
have
been
at
the
bar
for
27
years,
i
have
seen
the
extension
of
doctrines
who
later
along
--
today's
test
is
not
tomorrows.
you
don't
measure
today
against
what
happened
yesterday
or
what
happened
a
year
ago.
you
measure
it
against
what
happened
yesterday.
that
now
becomes
a
new
test.
then
you
go
over
here
and
you
got
the
new
test
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
first
thing
you
know,
you're
diametrically
at
opposite
poles.
this
is
what
i
say
can
and
this
is
what
i
say
might
well
happen.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
not
saying
i
want
you
to
straighten
anything
else
up
other
than
this
particular
matter
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
like
we
have
in
the
trial
of
criminal
cases
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
as
i
believe
former
chief
justice
warren
and
mr.
justice
clark
suggested
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
as
i
believe
it's
the
view
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
might
well
be
mr.
justice
white's
view
that
i
think
that
if
that
is
established
at
least,
we
put
to
rest
unless
there
is
clear
air
as
long
as
there
is
a
substantial
basis
--
amount
of
evidence
to
support
the
finding
that
then
the
banning
of
the
particular
law
might
apply.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
seven.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
seven
and
five
sitting
--
generally
only
five
sit
there,
they're
rotating.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
everything
in
life
has
got
to
be
based
upon
somebody's
judgment
evaluation.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
de
grazia
was
making
a
great
part
that
there
we're
two
justices
--
judges
in
new
york
against
one
but
if
i
got
that
jury
of
12
that
held
that
this
was
obscene
and
that
it
offended
temporary
community
standards
and
that
it
was
without
redeeming
social
value,
all
of
these
people
found
it
was
bad.
but
two
judges
against
one
said
it
was
all
right
and
with
all
due
respect
again
to
this
court,
this
court
acts
as
the
ultimate
censor.
you're
putting
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
community
and
i've
heard
other
members
of
this
court
criticize
the
fact
that
this
is
happening.
and
i
heard
mr.
--
i
read
mr.
justice
brennan
say
unless
don't
talk
about
super
censors,
but
then
i
read
other
opinions
that
say
that
this
is
what
this
court
is.
it's
a
super
censor
and
as
long
as
you're
going
to
be
a
super
censor,
you're
going
to
end
up
by
having
yourself
completely
choked
by
the
mass
of
cases
that
are
going
to
continue
to
come
before
or
unless
you,
if
i
may
that
i
won't
use
the
expression,
but
you
know
that
confucius
once
said
that
unless
you
--
unless
you
just
suddenly
realized
that
you're
going
to
throw
everything
to
the
winds
and
let
it
happen,
this
is
what
you're
faced
with.
in
the
continual
of
--
i'm
sorry,
i
hope
i
tried
to
address
myself
to
some
of
the
problems
that
the
court
is
having.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
thank
you
very
much.
