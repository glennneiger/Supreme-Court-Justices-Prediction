mr.
de
grazia,
am
i
right
that
despite
the
wording
of
the
statute,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
who
took
--
judge
in
this
film
in
terms
of
the
roth
and
memoirs
statutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
you're
not
making
--
not
a
basis
for
statute
on
its
face
but
rather
material
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
devote
any
more
time
with
the
argument
of
chief
justice
inquired
about
and
what
the
impact
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
should
be?
i
understood
your
brief
to
argue
that
in
the
first
common
error,
first
amendment
right
field,
not
as
a
matter
of
reason
you
dictated
but
it's
a
matter
of
giving
protective
effect
to
the
supremacy
matter
or
to
a
preemption
matter,
the
--
and
to
relieve
the
rule
in
this
field
from
the
threat
of
different
kinds
of
decisions
from
the
state
courts,
and
then
given
by
the
federal
courts
that
the
first
federal
decision
as
a
matter
of
supremacy
law
or
preemption
law,
as
we
used
to
call
it,
should
be
controlling?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
argue
that
for
me?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
thought
it
was
quite
an
interesting
argument?[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
carry
that
beyond
the
(inaudible)
that
in
all
areas
of
the
federal
adjudication
--
federal
constitution?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
ruling
of
this
court?[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
states
of
the
union
has
this
film
been
shown
to?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan

much
concerned
about
the
maryland
decision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
score
board
of
the
judiciary
on
this?
how
many
courts
have
voted
obscene
and
how
many
have
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
got
an
enormous
background
of
obscenity
cases
in
maryland
in
regards
to
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
sure
there's
lots
of
conduct
in
this
film?
justice
john
m.

never
mind.
