mr.
sam
rosenwein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
at
the
very
offset
in
the
light
of
the
last
remarks
of
the
solicitor
general
that
i
too
perhaps
with
less
indulgence
of
the
court
conclude
with
a
few
general
remarks
that
are
not
exactly
related
to
the
record
in
any
specific
manner,
but
i
should
probably
take
as
my
angle
of
vision,
the
rights
of
adult
citizens
in
the
united
states
to
choose
for
themselves
what
they
want
to
see,
what
they
want
to
read
and
how
they
want
to
live
and
i
shall
probably
also
refer
to
the
fact
that
mr.
cousins
has
not
yet
qualified
either
as
a
expert
in
constitutional
law
nor
a
member
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
freedoms
guaranteed
to
us
by
the
first
amendment.
i
would
like
to
say
that
some
of
the
remarks
of
mr.
cousins
bordered
to
me
on
the
--
well
i
won't
say
that.
to
the
merits
of
this
proceeding,
we
deal
here
with
a
situation
involving
only
an
adult
citizen
who
has
requested
that
explicit
sexual
material
be
sent
to
him.
that
is
the
only
issue
here
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
power
to
forbid
the
mailing
to
such
an
adult
citizen
expression,
explicit
sexual
material
that
he
has
requested
and
that
he
wants
to
pay
for
it,
that
is
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
think
the
difference
would
be
that
we're
dealing
in
one
case
with
the
first
amendment
application,
implication
and
the
other
with
something
that
falls
outside
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
in
the
light
of
first
amendment
protection
let
me
add
that
first.
now
i
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
proper
dimension.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
it
would
in
one
sense
require
overruling
roth,
but
not
on
the
narrow
ground
that
your
honor
is
putting
it
for
this
reason.
obviously
in
roth,
that
issue
was
not
presented
to
this
court
nor
any
of
the
court
in
roth.
no
one
focused
on
the
recipient.
what
was
involved
simply
was
whether
or
not
the
person
who
had
disseminated
the
material
was
liable
to
prosecution.
we
have
since
roth
gone
through
14
years
of
decision.
it
seems
to
me
when
one
seeks
the
meaning
of
a
decision
that
one
can't
look
at
it
statically
as
does
roth
mean
what
it
meant
in
1957.
no
roth
means
something
now
different
in
1971.
it
has
the
impress
of
14
years
of
decisions
mr.
fleishman
has
developed
that
and
now
we
deal
with
the
situation
which
stanley
brought
--
stanley
against
georgia
brought
into
focus,
what
about
the
right
of
a
citizen.
after
all
he
is
the
one
that
we
are
dealing
with.
now,
i
am
not
going
again
to
repeat
all
of
the
arguments
that
were
by
mr.
fleishman.
i
associate
myself
with
him.
i
adopt
his
arguments
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
stanley.
i
agree
with
him
that
stanley
stands
for
the
proposition
that
one
has
the
right
to
receive
explicit
sexual
materials
which
may
in
the
opinion
of
some
people
have
no
ideas
at
all.
in
other
words,
people
have
the
right
to
have
ideas,
information
entertainment
which
may
seem
have
no
value
to
anybody,
they
have
the
right
to
receive
that
in
their
home
and
they
have
that
right
under
the
first
amendment.
i
interpret
stanley
as
saying
again
and
again
that
under
the
first
amendment
one
has
that
right.
if
one
has
that
right,
if
obscene
material
therefore
has
that
protection
when
mr.
stanley
can
read
it
etcetera
i
would
assume
that
a
traditional
first
amendment
principles
apply.
under
what
respects
can
that
right
to
read
to
be
limited?
now,
the
only
justifications
that
we
can
see
for
a
limitation
on
that
right
would
be
if
those
materials
were
distributed
to
the
children.
the
another
limitation
were
if
they
were
obtrusively
forced
upon
other
persons,
but
in
all
other
respects
mr.
stanley
has
the
right
to
read
and
if
that
first
amendment
right
means
anything
it
must
mean
right
to
acquire
it.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
exactly
the
point.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
stanley
says
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
specific
language
obviously,
nothing
is
mentioned
of
that
because
we're
not
at
that
moment
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
dealing
first.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
that's
exactly
the
position
i
take.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i'm
getting
by
roth
by
that
and
i'm
getting
--
i
am
making
my
argument
built
on
roth
and
all
the
cases
including
redrup
and
stanley
thereafter
for
this
reason
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
possess
it,
to
read
it,
as
was
stated
in
stanley,
there
are
dozens
of
cases,
some
of
them
were
cited
in
stanley
which
says
that
one
has
the
right
to
acquire
it,
one
has
the
right
to
send,
to
communicate
to
that
man.
of
course,
in
fact
your
honor,
it
was
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
to
send
through
the
mails
because
you
have
said
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
your
honor
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
the
court
has
said
on
the
number
of
occasions
that
on
today’s
situation
not
to
send
through
the
mails
which
is
a
form
of
communication
that
is
most
often
used
in
an
organized
society
today
and
of
course
the
government's
position
cuts
broader
than
your
honor’s
inquiry
because
they
would
say
that
you
can’t
disseminate
in
any
form
from
which
its
follows.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
is
true
your
honor.
stanley
did
not
specifically
deal
with
the
mailing
situation,
but
all
i’m
arguing
for
in
this
case
is
that
if
you
have
that
right
to
possess
it
then
surely
there
must
be
a
right
to
both
acquire
it,
to
receive
it
and
to
communicate.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
byrne
against
karalexis,
you
will
find
a
concession
by
the
government
that
of
course
if
there
is
a
right
to
receive,
there
is
obviously
a
right
to
communicate,
there
is
a
right
to
disseminate,
that
is
conceded
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
here
another
a
concession
from
the
government.
they
say
well
we
have
a
policy
that
you
could
use
the
mails
and
to
send
obscene
material
to
mr.
stanley,
if
you
didn’t
charge
or
force.
now,
so
far
as
the
federal
government’s
interest
in
this,
take
that
for
example,
the
attenuated
interest
in
obscenity
that
justice
harlan
has
referred
to,
here
you
have
a
concession
from
government,
well
of
course
you
can
mail
pornography,
and
of
course
mr.
--
he
has
the
right
to
receive
it.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well
he’s
only
different
in
the
sense
that
the
material
is
different,
but
he
is
sending
at
the
request
of
somebody
who
wants
it,
that's
all.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
we
have
three
solicitations
here
and
three
adult
citizens
asked
for
it
and
received
the
material.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
there
was
some
material
seized,
yes,
but
your
honor
this
started
with
an
advertisement
and
adults
answered
an
advertisement,
three
adults
answered
the
advertisement
and
it
was
sent
to
those
three
of
those.
now,
what
is
the
right
of
those
citizens?
can
anyone
be
prosecuted
for
sending
that
material
at
an
adult's
request?
what
right
has
mr.
stanley
got
under
the
today's
situation
when
you
build
a
wall
around
him
and
say
look
mr.
stanley,
you
can
have
that
in
your
library
and
by
the
way
he
only
got
his
library
through
the
mail,
i
mean,
he
didn't
manufacture
that
library.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
my
only
point
is
that
you
get
libraries
through
the
mail.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
but
there
was
a
reference
to
the
library
in
the
(inaudible)
opinion.
there
was
a
reference
to
the
library.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
but
now
my
only
point
is
that
and
i‘m
only
quoting
--
i
quote
here
from
blount
against
rizzi,
mr.
fleishman
has
handed
me
the
opinion.
the
united
states
may
give
up
the
post
office
when
it
sees
fit,
but
while
it
carries
on
the
use
of
the
mail,
it
is
almost
as
much
a
part
of
free
speech
as
the
right
to
use
our
tongues.
now
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
in
generally
speaking,
in
broad
terms,
there
have
been
so
called,
imitations
of
what
we
call
time,
place
and
manner.
so
for
example
while
you
have
the
right
to
speak
freely
and
the
right
to
assemble
freely,
one
could
not
do
that
at
5
o'
clock
on
the
main
street
when
the
traffic
is
going.
now,
in
the
same
fashion,
in
this
area,
we
have
accepted
for
present
purposes
that
the
two
compelling
considerations
that
we
think
the
state
properly
might
point
to
and
limiting
the
distribution
of
obscene
material.
one
that
it
not
be
distributed
to
minors,
this
under
a
specific
statute
and
they
--
we
have
now
in
about
35
to
40
states,
specific
statutes
to
deal
with
distribution
to
minors
and
the
other
is
obtrusive
forcing.
you
dealt
with
that
in
rowan
to
some
degree.
now,
i
myself
confessed
that
as
far
as
obtrusiveness
and
the
front
is
concerned,
there
will
have
to
be
some
further
thinking
in
cases
as
to
what
that
means
because
obviously
i’m
not
talking
of
the
kind
of
a
front
that
sometimes
comes
when
we
have
to
listen
to
speakers
we
don’t
like.
this
court
has
never
held
at
that
justified
limitations,
but
i
think
i’m
talking
about
a
front
that
virtually
invades
the
privacy
of
someone
that
really
forces
itself
upon
him.
that
kind
of
situation,
but
this
is
the
situation
in
which
the
adult
citizen
is
merely
asking
that
he
--
can
it
be
--
you
--
when
your
honor
wrote
in
rowan,
you
pointed
out
that
congress
has
permitted
citizens
to
build
the
wall
around
their
homes
so
that
obtrusive
material
cannot
be
forced
upon
them,
can
it
be
now
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
put
a
wall
around
mr.
stanley,
when
mr.
stanley
wants
to
go
out
and
get
a
book,
he
wants
to
get
some
explicit
material
for
himself?
can
it
be
that
he
cannot
write
and
say
to
someone
who
has
put
an
ad
in
the
paper,
yes
i
would
like
to
have
that
material?
if
our
country
needs
anything,
the
right
of
people
to
choose,
i
would
think
that
this
is
fundamental.
certainly,
this
is
perhaps
some
part
of
my
answer
to
the
solicitor
general,
it’s
a
little
different
from
contemporaneous
offense
in
other
parts
of
the
world,
in
czechoslovakia
or
russia.
this
country
lets
individuals
choose.
would
you
say
to
a
man
who’s
getting
a
social
security
at
65,
look
here
to
your
money,
but
don’t
spend
it
for
this
event.
no,
we
give
the
money
to
the
individual
and
we
have
confidence
that
he
will
use
it.
the
government
does
not
concern
itself
with
what
amend
choose
as
to
do
with
his
money.
can
you
say
to
a
man,
you
can
read
this
or
you
cannot
read
this
for
his
own
intellectual
nourishment
and
can
it
be
argued
that
a
political
speech
or
as
was
held
in
kingsley,
the
advocacy
of
a
adultery
as
a
permissible
way
of
life
which
was
held
to
be
constitutionally
protecting
is
alright
for
a
citizen
to
look
at
it.
it’s
a
100%
protected,
but
the
explicit
sexual
materials
which
might
deal
with
the
very
same
subject
in
a
little
more
detail,
that
citizen
cannot
read.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
i
think
that’s
–
and
to
some
degree
that’s
true
and
that
congressional
decision
has
been
upheld.
now,
on
the
question
that
congressional
action
i
think
of
the
congressional
action
is
quite
appropriate.
we
should
have
congressional
action
in
this
area
and
the
reason
we
should
have
congressional
action
in
this
area
is
this.
now
this
100-year
so
called
venerable
statute
which
is
called
the
comstock
act
and
i
don’t
believe
that
mr.
comstock
was
venerable,
not
in
my
opinion,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened,
it
is
time
for
congress
to
do
what
it
is
doing,
begin
to
go
over
all
of
these
statutes
were
obviously
overbroad.
the
point
that
we
are
asking
this
court
is
only
to
perform
a
judicial
function
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
covers
consenting
adults
as
well
as
others.
it
covers
people
who
really
want
it.
congress
has
indicated
that
it
can
act
and
it
has
done
that,
it
has
done
its
part.
it
has
now
provided
that
if
an
adult
and
his
minors
included
a
rather
old
minor,
but
in
any
event
minors
included,
can
even
not
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
subject
to
even
one
mailing.
he
can
put
his
name
on
the
list
now
and
get
no
mailings
of
sexually
oriented
material
and
congress
has
provided
both
civil
and
penal
sanctions
for
that.
so,
we
have
carefully
edged
out
those
upon
whom
material
is
obtrusively
forced
ought
minus.
what
congress
cannot
do
under
the
constitution,
we
submit,
is
forbid
the
mailing
of
obscene
material
to
an
individual,
an
adult
citizen
who
has
requested
it
and
i
think
that
the
court
below
properly
concluded
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
because
the
failure
to
allege
the
essential
allegations,
but
again
like
mr.
fleishman,
i
think
the
court
here
might
properly
say
that
this
comstock
act
is
too
broad
and
therefore
it
cannot
stand
compatible
with
the
first
amendment.
it
is
true
as
the
solicitor
general
says
that
two
or
three
decisions
that
are
dealt
with
stanley
have
limited,
saying,
well
it
deals
only
with
privacy,
but
17
district
judges
from
california,
massachusetts,
oregon,
minnesota
some
of
the
most
eminent
jurists
have
read
stanley
and
have
understood
in
the
light
of
everything
that’s
gone
up
to
this
point
and
so
far
as
a
consenting
adult
is
concerned,
he
should
have
his
freedom
and
the
man
who
mails
to
him
should
certainly
as
his
steward,
as
the
man
who
will
furnish
him
this
communication
to
certainly
be
protected
from
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
might
say
if
the
court
reads
those
opinions
that
we
have
added
to
our
brief,
you
will
find
implicit
in
it,
a
great
sigh
of
relief
from
all
the
judges
because
we
are
clogged
and
our
calendars
are
clogged
with
cases
that
really
don’t
belong
there.
and
some
of
the
members
of
the
squad
maybe
too
young
to
remember
the
probation
days,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
we
are
reaching
about
the
same
kind
of
disrespect
for
the
law
in
those
aspects,
the
enforceability
of
it.
i
recall
myself
coming
into
the
eastern
district
in
new
york
and
chief
judge
saying
well,
this
is
bogging
day.
everybody
$10
fine
and
pharmacists
and
bootleggers
and
everybody
is
marching
up.
shall
we
return
to
bootleggers
and
a
first
amendment
material,
i
think
not.
thank
you.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
at
the
very
offset
in
the
light
of
the
last
remarks
of
the
solicitor
general
that
i
too
perhaps
with
less
indulgence
of
the
court
conclude
with
a
few
general
remarks
that
are
not
exactly
related
to
the
record
in
any
specific
manner,
but
i
should
probably
take
as
my
angle
of
vision,
the
rights
of
adult
citizens
in
the
united
states
to
choose
for
themselves
what
they
want
to
see,
what
they
want
to
read
and
how
they
want
to
live
and
i
shall
probably
also
refer
to
the
fact
that
mr.
cousins
has
not
yet
qualified
either
as
a
expert
in
constitutional
law
nor
a
member
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
freedoms
guaranteed
to
us
by
the
first
amendment.
i
would
like
to
say
that
some
of
the
remarks
of
mr.
cousins
bordered
to
me
on
the
--
well
i
won't
say
that.
to
the
merits
of
this
proceeding,
we
deal
here
with
a
situation
involving
only
an
adult
citizen
who
has
requested
that
explicit
sexual
material
be
sent
to
him.
that
is
the
only
issue
here
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
power
to
forbid
the
mailing
to
such
an
adult
citizen
expression,
explicit
sexual
material
that
he
has
requested
and
that
he
wants
to
pay
for
it,
that
is
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
think
the
difference
would
be
that
we're
dealing
in
one
case
with
the
first
amendment
application,
implication
and
the
other
with
something
that
falls
outside
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
in
the
light
of
first
amendment
protection
let
me
add
that
first.
now
i
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
proper
dimension.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
it
would
in
one
sense
require
overruling
roth,
but
not
on
the
narrow
ground
that
your
honor
is
putting
it
for
this
reason.
obviously
in
roth,
that
issue
was
not
presented
to
this
court
nor
any
of
the
court
in
roth.
no
one
focused
on
the
recipient.
what
was
involved
simply
was
whether
or
not
the
person
who
had
disseminated
the
material
was
liable
to
prosecution.
we
have
since
roth
gone
through
14
years
of
decision.
it
seems
to
me
when
one
seeks
the
meaning
of
a
decision
that
one
can't
look
at
it
statically
as
does
roth
mean
what
it
meant
in
1957.
no
roth
means
something
now
different
in
1971.
it
has
the
impress
of
14
years
of
decisions
mr.
fleishman
has
developed
that
and
now
we
deal
with
the
situation
which
stanley
brought
--
stanley
against
georgia
brought
into
focus,
what
about
the
right
of
a
citizen.
after
all
he
is
the
one
that
we
are
dealing
with.
now,
i
am
not
going
again
to
repeat
all
of
the
arguments
that
were
by
mr.
fleishman.
i
associate
myself
with
him.
i
adopt
his
arguments
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
stanley.
i
agree
with
him
that
stanley
stands
for
the
proposition
that
one
has
the
right
to
receive
explicit
sexual
materials
which
may
in
the
opinion
of
some
people
have
no
ideas
at
all.
in
other
words,
people
have
the
right
to
have
ideas,
information
entertainment
which
may
seem
have
no
value
to
anybody,
they
have
the
right
to
receive
that
in
their
home
and
they
have
that
right
under
the
first
amendment.
i
interpret
stanley
as
saying
again
and
again
that
under
the
first
amendment
one
has
that
right.
if
one
has
that
right,
if
obscene
material
therefore
has
that
protection
when
mr.
stanley
can
read
it
etcetera
i
would
assume
that
a
traditional
first
amendment
principles
apply.
under
what
respects
can
that
right
to
read
to
be
limited?
now,
the
only
justifications
that
we
can
see
for
a
limitation
on
that
right
would
be
if
those
materials
were
distributed
to
the
children.
the
another
limitation
were
if
they
were
obtrusively
forced
upon
other
persons,
but
in
all
other
respects
mr.
stanley
has
the
right
to
read
and
if
that
first
amendment
right
means
anything
it
must
mean
right
to
acquire
it.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
exactly
the
point.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
stanley
says
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
specific
language
obviously,
nothing
is
mentioned
of
that
because
we're
not
at
that
moment
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
dealing
first.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
that's
exactly
the
position
i
take.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i'm
getting
by
roth
by
that
and
i'm
getting
--
i
am
making
my
argument
built
on
roth
and
all
the
cases
including
redrup
and
stanley
thereafter
for
this
reason
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
possess
it,
to
read
it,
as
was
stated
in
stanley,
there
are
dozens
of
cases,
some
of
them
were
cited
in
stanley
which
says
that
one
has
the
right
to
acquire
it,
one
has
the
right
to
send,
to
communicate
to
that
man.
of
course,
in
fact
your
honor,
it
was
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes,
to
send
through
the
mails
because
you
have
said
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
your
honor
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
the
court
has
said
on
the
number
of
occasions
that
on
today’s
situation
not
to
send
through
the
mails
which
is
a
form
of
communication
that
is
most
often
used
in
an
organized
society
today
and
of
course
the
government's
position
cuts
broader
than
your
honor’s
inquiry
because
they
would
say
that
you
can’t
disseminate
in
any
form
from
which
its
follows.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
that
is
true
your
honor.
stanley
did
not
specifically
deal
with
the
mailing
situation,
but
all
i’m
arguing
for
in
this
case
is
that
if
you
have
that
right
to
possess
it
then
surely
there
must
be
a
right
to
both
acquire
it,
to
receive
it
and
to
communicate.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
byrne
against
karalexis,
you
will
find
a
concession
by
the
government
that
of
course
if
there
is
a
right
to
receive,
there
is
obviously
a
right
to
communicate,
there
is
a
right
to
disseminate,
that
is
conceded
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
here
another
a
concession
from
the
government.
they
say
well
we
have
a
policy
that
you
could
use
the
mails
and
to
send
obscene
material
to
mr.
stanley,
if
you
didn’t
charge
or
force.
now,
so
far
as
the
federal
government’s
interest
in
this,
take
that
for
example,
the
attenuated
interest
in
obscenity
that
justice
harlan
has
referred
to,
here
you
have
a
concession
from
government,
well
of
course
you
can
mail
pornography,
and
of
course
mr.
--
he
has
the
right
to
receive
it.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well
he’s
only
different
in
the
sense
that
the
material
is
different,
but
he
is
sending
at
the
request
of
somebody
who
wants
it,
that's
all.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
we
have
three
solicitations
here
and
three
adult
citizens
asked
for
it
and
received
the
material.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
there
was
some
material
seized,
yes,
but
your
honor
this
started
with
an
advertisement
and
adults
answered
an
advertisement,
three
adults
answered
the
advertisement
and
it
was
sent
to
those
three
of
those.
now,
what
is
the
right
of
those
citizens?
can
anyone
be
prosecuted
for
sending
that
material
at
an
adult's
request?
what
right
has
mr.
stanley
got
under
the
today's
situation
when
you
build
a
wall
around
him
and
say
look
mr.
stanley,
you
can
have
that
in
your
library
and
by
the
way
he
only
got
his
library
through
the
mail,
i
mean,
he
didn't
manufacture
that
library.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes.
my
only
point
is
that
you
get
libraries
through
the
mail.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
but
there
was
a
reference
to
the
library
in
the
(inaudible)
opinion.
there
was
a
reference
to
the
library.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
but
now
my
only
point
is
that
and
i‘m
only
quoting
--
i
quote
here
from
blount
against
rizzi,
mr.
fleishman
has
handed
me
the
opinion.
the
united
states
may
give
up
the
post
office
when
it
sees
fit,
but
while
it
carries
on
the
use
of
the
mail,
it
is
almost
as
much
a
part
of
free
speech
as
the
right
to
use
our
tongues.
now
--
mr.
sam
rosenwein
right.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
well,
in
generally
speaking,
in
broad
terms,
there
have
been
so
called,
imitations
of
what
we
call
time,
place
and
manner.
so
for
example
while
you
have
the
right
to
speak
freely
and
the
right
to
assemble
freely,
one
could
not
do
that
at
5
o'
clock
on
the
main
street
when
the
traffic
is
going.
now,
in
the
same
fashion,
in
this
area,
we
have
accepted
for
present
purposes
that
the
two
compelling
considerations
that
we
think
the
state
properly
might
point
to
and
limiting
the
distribution
of
obscene
material.
one
that
it
not
be
distributed
to
minors,
this
under
a
specific
statute
and
they
--
we
have
now
in
about
35
to
40
states,
specific
statutes
to
deal
with
distribution
to
minors
and
the
other
is
obtrusive
forcing.
you
dealt
with
that
in
rowan
to
some
degree.
now,
i
myself
confessed
that
as
far
as
obtrusiveness
and
the
front
is
concerned,
there
will
have
to
be
some
further
thinking
in
cases
as
to
what
that
means
because
obviously
i’m
not
talking
of
the
kind
of
a
front
that
sometimes
comes
when
we
have
to
listen
to
speakers
we
don’t
like.
this
court
has
never
held
at
that
justified
limitations,
but
i
think
i’m
talking
about
a
front
that
virtually
invades
the
privacy
of
someone
that
really
forces
itself
upon
him.
that
kind
of
situation,
but
this
is
the
situation
in
which
the
adult
citizen
is
merely
asking
that
he
--
can
it
be
--
you
--
when
your
honor
wrote
in
rowan,
you
pointed
out
that
congress
has
permitted
citizens
to
build
the
wall
around
their
homes
so
that
obtrusive
material
cannot
be
forced
upon
them,
can
it
be
now
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
put
a
wall
around
mr.
stanley,
when
mr.
stanley
wants
to
go
out
and
get
a
book,
he
wants
to
get
some
explicit
material
for
himself?
can
it
be
that
he
cannot
write
and
say
to
someone
who
has
put
an
ad
in
the
paper,
yes
i
would
like
to
have
that
material?
if
our
country
needs
anything,
the
right
of
people
to
choose,
i
would
think
that
this
is
fundamental.
certainly,
this
is
perhaps
some
part
of
my
answer
to
the
solicitor
general,
it’s
a
little
different
from
contemporaneous
offense
in
other
parts
of
the
world,
in
czechoslovakia
or
russia.
this
country
lets
individuals
choose.
would
you
say
to
a
man
who’s
getting
a
social
security
at
65,
look
here
to
your
money,
but
don’t
spend
it
for
this
event.
no,
we
give
the
money
to
the
individual
and
we
have
confidence
that
he
will
use
it.
the
government
does
not
concern
itself
with
what
amend
choose
as
to
do
with
his
money.
can
you
say
to
a
man,
you
can
read
this
or
you
cannot
read
this
for
his
own
intellectual
nourishment
and
can
it
be
argued
that
a
political
speech
or
as
was
held
in
kingsley,
the
advocacy
of
a
adultery
as
a
permissible
way
of
life
which
was
held
to
be
constitutionally
protecting
is
alright
for
a
citizen
to
look
at
it.
it’s
a
100%
protected,
but
the
explicit
sexual
materials
which
might
deal
with
the
very
same
subject
in
a
little
more
detail,
that
citizen
cannot
read.
mr.
sam
rosenwein
yes
i
think
that’s
–
and
to
some
degree
that’s
true
and
that
congressional
decision
has
been
upheld.
now,
on
the
question
that
congressional
action
i
think
of
the
congressional
action
is
quite
appropriate.
we
should
have
congressional
action
in
this
area
and
the
reason
we
should
have
congressional
action
in
this
area
is
this.
now
this
100-year
so
called
venerable
statute
which
is
called
the
comstock
act
and
i
don’t
believe
that
mr.
comstock
was
venerable,
not
in
my
opinion,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened,
it
is
time
for
congress
to
do
what
it
is
doing,
begin
to
go
over
all
of
these
statutes
were
obviously
overbroad.
the
point
that
we
are
asking
this
court
is
only
to
perform
a
judicial
function
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
covers
consenting
adults
as
well
as
others.
it
covers
people
who
really
want
it.
congress
has
indicated
that
it
can
act
and
it
has
done
that,
it
has
done
its
part.
it
has
now
provided
that
if
an
adult
and
his
minors
included
a
rather
old
minor,
but
in
any
event
minors
included,
can
even
not
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
subject
to
even
one
mailing.
he
can
put
his
name
on
the
list
now
and
get
no
mailings
of
sexually
oriented
material
and
congress
has
provided
both
civil
and
penal
sanctions
for
that.
so,
we
have
carefully
edged
out
those
upon
whom
material
is
obtrusively
forced
ought
minus.
what
congress
cannot
do
under
the
constitution,
we
submit,
is
forbid
the
mailing
of
obscene
material
to
an
individual,
an
adult
citizen
who
has
requested
it
and
i
think
that
the
court
below
properly
concluded
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
because
the
failure
to
allege
the
essential
allegations,
but
again
like
mr.
fleishman,
i
think
the
court
here
might
properly
say
that
this
comstock
act
is
too
broad
and
therefore
it
cannot
stand
compatible
with
the
first
amendment.
it
is
true
as
the
solicitor
general
says
that
two
or
three
decisions
that
are
dealt
with
stanley
have
limited,
saying,
well
it
deals
only
with
privacy,
but
17
district
judges
from
california,
massachusetts,
oregon,
minnesota
some
of
the
most
eminent
jurists
have
read
stanley
and
have
understood
in
the
light
of
everything
that’s
gone
up
to
this
point
and
so
far
as
a
consenting
adult
is
concerned,
he
should
have
his
freedom
and
the
man
who
mails
to
him
should
certainly
as
his
steward,
as
the
man
who
will
furnish
him
this
communication
to
certainly
be
protected
from
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
might
say
if
the
court
reads
those
opinions
that
we
have
added
to
our
brief,
you
will
find
implicit
in
it,
a
great
sigh
of
relief
from
all
the
judges
because
we
are
clogged
and
our
calendars
are
clogged
with
cases
that
really
don’t
belong
there.
and
some
of
the
members
of
the
squad
maybe
too
young
to
remember
the
probation
days,
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
we
are
reaching
about
the
same
kind
of
disrespect
for
the
law
in
those
aspects,
the
enforceability
of
it.
i
recall
myself
coming
into
the
eastern
district
in
new
york
and
chief
judge
saying
well,
this
is
bogging
day.
everybody
$10
fine
and
pharmacists
and
bootleggers
and
everybody
is
marching
up.
shall
we
return
to
bootleggers
and
a
first
amendment
material,
i
think
not.
thank
you.
