chief

the
only
thing
mr.
rosenwein
that
if
you
make
that
same
argument,
if
he
were
requesting
from
a
pharmaceutical
house
a
forbidden
drug
like
narcotics
on
the
ground
that
he
was
going
to
use
it
just
for
himself,
wouldn’t
possibly
hurt
anybody
else.

well,
i
was
taking
your
rather
sweeping
phrase
about
people
doing
what
they
want
to
do?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
rosenwein,
you
were
speaking
before
about
a
point
that
i
would
like
to
have
you
clarify.
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
suggested
that
there
were
limitations
on
even
first
amendment
rights
in
dealing
with
ideas,
if
the
presentation
was
obtrusive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
where
do
you
find
any
constitutional
limitation
to
exercise
your
first
amendments
rights
in
a
particular
way
as
distinguished
from
exercising
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
the
rowan
holding
must
be
read
as
a
having
placed
limits
on
the
use
of
the
mails
in
a
way
that
had
not
been
done
before?
chief
