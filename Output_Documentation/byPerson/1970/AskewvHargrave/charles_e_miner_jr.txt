mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
february
of
1968
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
in
february
of
1968,
we,
in
florida,
underwent
a
rather
disquieting
situation
when
--
in
our
public
schools,
when
roughly
one
half
of
florida
school
teachers
went
out
on
what
they
termed
a
period
of
resignation.
they
blamed
insufficient
state
support
to
the
public
school
systems
for
their
determination
to
do
this.
the
legislature
was
responsive
to
the
plea
of
the
teachers
for
increased
state
funding
and
went
into,
at
the
call
of
the
governor,
to
executive
session
to
remedy
as
best
it
could
at
that
time,
the
inequities
in
public
school
financing
that
existed
at
that
time.
as
a
portion
of
the
legislative
amendments
that
were
passed
in
february
of
1968,
the
so-called
millage
rollback
act,
which
is
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
for
determination
was
enacted.
this
simply
stated
that
millage
rollback
act
told
to
each
county
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
people
within
your
county
vote
for
you
for
public
school
operating
purposes
in
addition
to
10
mills,
you
must
rollback
to
10
mills.
and
when
you
do
so,
we
will
then
guarantee
you
additional
state
funding
in
the
amount
of
at
least
$1,000.
now,
this
is
the
statute
that
is
under
attack.
appellees
contend
that
it
denies
to
florida
school
children
an
equal
economic
educational
opportunity,
which
they
say,
is
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
sources
of
revenue
--
no
sir.
the
sources
of
revenue
are
the
sales
and
use
taxes,
gasoline
taxes
sir.
primarily,
the
sales
tax
is
a
source
of
florida’s
revenue.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
as
i
will
expand
into
this
argument,
a
portion
of
the
property
tax,
a
certain
millage
figure,
is
figured
into
the
state
funding
formula,
but
it
does
not
come
into
the
state
as
such.
the
millage
rollback
act
set
a
10-mill
cap.
in
effect,
telling
the
counties
you
will
not
levy
an
excess
of
10
mills
if
you
want
to
participate
in
minimum
foundation
funding
program.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir
a
max
--
well,
there
were
certain
exceptions
to
the
10
mill
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
but
in
maximum
of
10
mills.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
capital
outlay.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
10-mill
limitation.
it’s
popularly
referred
to
in
florida
or
unpopular
in
some
circles
as
a
cap.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
a
maximum
of
10
mills.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
that
is
real
ad
valorem,
real
property.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
real
and
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right,
it’s
voted
--
that’s
owned
by
individual
citizens.
it’s
just
the
real
property
and
the
--
or
rather
the
tangible
personal
property
in
a
given
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes.
we
are
taxing
the
property
within
the
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes,
the
nonexempt
property.
we
have
a
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
well
--
we
--
there’s
a
constitutional
limitation
on
the
amount
of
personal
property
that
can
be
taxed,
constitution
limit.
and
florida
has
a
$5,000
homestead
exemption.
so
that
homestead
exemption,
that
$5,000,
comes
out
the
top.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
am
of
opinion
that
they
could
your
honor.
that
they
could
--
since
it
grants
the
taxing
power
through
its
legislature
them
i’m
of
the
opinion
that
it
can
identify
sources
that
can
be
utilized
for
public
school
financing
and
we,
in
florida,
in
fact,
do
so.
the
public
schools
in
florida
are
financed
as
a
partnership
between
the
state
and
the
county.
the
argument
made
by
appellees
that
it,
the
operation
of
the
millage
rollback,
act
discriminates
against
the
school
children
in
florida’s
property
poor
counties,
i.e.
property
poor
in
relation
to
their
student
numbers,
would
have
great
appeal
if
the
public
schools
in
florida
were
financed
solely
from
local
ad
valorem
taxes,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
what
this
10-mill
cap
serves
to
do,
or
the
10-mill
maximum
limitations
serves
to
do,
is
to
narrow
the
gap
that
has
historically
existed
in
florida.
an
example,
glades
county
florida,
1-mill
of
tax
applied
to
the
assessment
rules,
glades
county
will
raise
$89.00
and
some
cents
per
student.
and
gadsden
county,
florida,
one
of
florida’s
property
poor
counties,
it
will
only
raise
$8.21.
in
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
to
unleash,
as
it
were,
the
taxing
power
of
the
wealthier
school
districts
would
be
as
to
magnify
the
very
inequities
that
the
plaintiffs
or
rather
the
appellee
suggest
that
that
exist.
so,
florida
has,
for
some
years,
realized
that
we
could
not
forever
rely
on
the
property
tax
within
a
given
county.
we
had
to
do
something
at
the
state
level
to
infuse
more
state
dollars
into
education,
public
education.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
socio
--
actually
the
socioeconomic
fact
that
some
counties
are
poor
in
relation
to
their
student
numbers
and
others
are
rich.
glades
county,
the
small
county
that
i’ve
mentioned,
has
844
students.
dade
county,
on
the
other
hand,
has
thousand
and
thousands
of
students.
and
this
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
there
were
two
or
three
affidavits
submitted
at
that
time
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
i
did
not
--
at
that
time
i
was
not
representing
the
state
board
of
education.
it
was
handled
by
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
this
was
included
your
honor,
because
these
facts
at
the
time
were
not
available
to
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
were
very
relevant
and
significant
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes.
yes
it
could
be
made.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
could
not
answer
that
your
honor,
because
as
i
say
was
--
i
did
not
represent
the
state
board
of
education
at
that
time.
if
the
millage
rollback
act
is
considered
in
context
with
other
of
the
legislative
enactments,
the
very
reversed
proposition
that,
as
asserted
by
appellees,
is
the
case.
it
protects
the
school
children
in
florida’s
property
poor
counties
by
bringing
--
by
narrowing
or
bridging
the
gap
that
presently
exists.
appellees
suggest
that
we
might
--
one
way
that
we
might
finance
our
public
education
is
to
give
each
student
in
each
county
a
given
amount
of
dollars.
in
the
reply
brief
that
was
filed
in
this
case,
we
suggested
that
that
sum
be
$400,
and
as
they
are
requesting,
the
millage
rollback
act
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
per
pupil,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
$400.00
will
come
from
the
state.
the
millage
limitation,
the
maximum
--
or
the
cap,
will
be
eliminated
if
the
release
sought
by
appellees
is
afforded.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that
this
is
only
the
state
source.
we
are
going
to
eliminate
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
this
is
what
the
appellees
suggest
that
might
be
done
and
might
be
constitutional.
so,
i
am
taking
their
argument
in
finding
out
just
what
happened
if
we
did
this,
but
assuming
that
we
would
give
$400.00
per
pupil,
to
every
pupil
in
florida,
from
state
source.
or
--
yes,
state
sources,
assuming
then,
no
10-mill
cap,
alright.
if
we
did
this,
florida’s
richest
county
in
terms
of
its
student
population
to
its
assessed
value
or
to
--
yes
to
its
assessed
value
would
have
333%
more
money
with
which
to
educate
its
children
than
the
--
than
the
father
in
florida’s
poorest
county,
gadsden.
so,
the
cap
was
simply
a
transitional
equalizing
device
that
was
placed
on
local
tax
authority
until
such
time.
and
until
--
and
it
will
be
removed.
it
has
been
repealed.
this
very
statute
has
been
repealed
effective
july
1,
1974.
at
which
time
in
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature,
we
will
have
increased
state
support
to
the
basic
funding
unit
of
public
education
that
is
the
instructional
unit.
we
will
have
increased
it
by
50%
above
what
it
is
today.
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
well,
i
think
yes
your
honor
that
the
voters
are
going
to
take
care
of
that
by
themselves
with
regard
to
voting
additional
millage.
we
don’t
feel
that
there
would
be
any
necessity
for
the
cap
at
that
time,
because
we
will
have
funneled
in
such
a
great
proportion
of
state
monies
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
levy
any
substantial
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
the
state
has
recognized
its
burden
under
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
true.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
right.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
on
local
sources.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
instead
of
depending
primarily
on
ad
valorem
tax,
local
property
taxes,
they
now
get
in
taxes
that
are
raised
by
use
taxes,
or
gasoline
tax
or
sales
tax.
the
sources
of
taxes
is
somewhat
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
because
at
the
same
time
the
millage
rollback
act
was
enacted,
there
was
a
pledge
in
the
same
provision
that
farther
would
guarantee,
at
least
for
that
particular
year,
an
additional
$1,000
in
state
sources.
now,
this
act
was
further
amended
in
1970
to
provide
that
for
the
next
four
years,
ending
and
--
at
the
end
of
fiscal
year
in
1974
that
florida
would
infuse
each
year
an
additional
$1,100
into
each
instruction
unit.
so
that
at
that
time
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
still
the
sales
and
use
taxes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
these
are
projections.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
based
on
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
right.
so
by
that
time,
the
instructional
unit,
which
is
the
basic
unit
to
financing
in
florida,
will
have
achieved
the
worth
of
$14,100
per
unit.
it
is
presently
$9,700
per
unit.
and
at
that
time,
we
feel
that
the
state
will
have
acquitted
itself
of
its
responsibility
to
as
nearly
equalize
as
possible
economic
education
opportunity
for
all
of
its
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
an
instruction
on
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
a
statutory
formula
contained
in
the
minimum
foundation
funding
program
body
of
statutes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
an
educational
unit,
if
your
honor
will
permit,
an
educational
unit,
a
typical
educational
unit
in
florida,
is
one
teacher
and
27
pupils
in
the
educational
situation.
now,
that
is
the
typical.
now,
the
value
of
a
given
education
or
rather
unit
of
identified
need
or
an
instructional
unit,
it
does
vary.
for
instance,
an
exceptional
children
in
the
florida
school
for
the
deaf
and
the
blind.
an
instructional,
a
typical
instruction
unit
is
one
teacher
in
five
pupils.
so
--
and
the
value
varies
depending
upon
the
time
in
rates
so
to
speak
of
the
teacher
who
is
teaching
the
unit,
but
on
the
average,
the
typical
unit
is
worth
presently
$9,700.
those
units
are
distributed
throughout
florida
on
an
equal
basis.
there
is
no
--
depending
on
the
number
of
students.
you
divide
the
number
of
students
by
27
and
put
a
teacher
with
them
and
that
is
an
instructional
unit.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
to
the
--
yes
sir.
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
in
answer
to
direct
response
sir,
i
would
suggest
that
there
were
--
the
reason
that
it
was
put
on
there
to
begin
with,
was
as
the
result
of
an
overview
that
there
had
to
be
afforded
to
the
tax
payers
in
some
of
florida’s
counties
ad
valorem
tax
relief.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
say
in
all,
honestly
this
was
--
this
was
a
determination,
but
that
was
not
the
primary
determination
as
far
as
the
cap
was
concerned.
we
had
long
been
concerned
in
florida
with
the
fact
that
some
counties
could
raise
and
could
infuse
local
funds
into
their
system
greatly
in
excess
of
the
ability
of
other
counties
to
do
the
same
thing.
and
while
we
were
attempting
to
equalize,
equalize
education
--
economic
educational
opportunity,
it
was
felt
that
a
cap
would
be
the
prudent
thing.
now,
to
take
the
cap
away
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
if
i
may
sir
go
back
to
one
point
and
then
perhaps
i
can
respond
more
fully
to
your
query.
the
way
that
we
arrive
at
how
much
money
is
going
to
be
spent
in
the
florida
public
schools
each
year,
is
done
statutorily.
but
identified
units
of
need
are
first
compiled.
that
gives
us
a
figure
of
how
much
education
in
florida
is
going
to
cost
us
this
year.
the
states
are
required,
as
part
of
what
we
call
local
effort,
it’s
their
local
effort
to
levy
at
least
for
this
year
four
mills.
it’s
either
three
or
four
this
year.
but
whatever
that
amount
of
money
will
raise
on
the
tax
role
of
that
individual
county
is
subtracted
from
the
additive,
the
units
of
need.
and
the
remainder
there
is
what
the
state
will
be
required
to
put
into
that
particular
county.
as
a
part
of
the
1970
equalization
act,
all
counties
are
--
or
rather
it
was
mandated
by
the
legislature
that
each
county
--
the
auditor
general
of
florida
would
conduct
a
so-called
racial
study
to
find
out
what
the
assessment
practices
were
in
the
several
states.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
counties.
the
counties,
there
has
always
historically
in
florida
been
wide
variation
in
assessment
practices.
i’m
certain
it’s
not
unusual
in
florida.
but
there
was
--
this
was
also
at
the
time
the
millage
rollback
act
was
--
or
at
the
following
year.
this
review
was
mandated
and
in
attempt
to
find
out
who
was
assessing
fairly
and
who
was
not
assessing
fairly,
because
we
had
traditionally,
we
had
traditionally
rewarded
those
counties
for
bad
assessment
practices
by
given
them
additional
state
monies.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
that
is
the
direction
that
we
are
moving
in
florida
as
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir
i
don’t
--
i
think
it
wasn’t
part
of
political
decision.
i
think
it
was
a
decision
that
was
made
as
a
result
of
what
we
saw
could
happen
to
the
public
schools
in
florida
with
great
dissatisfaction
among
our
parents
and
among
our
teachers.
and
it
was
this
sad
occurrence
that
focused
the
attention
on
the
need
for
additional
state
participation
in
the
funding
process.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that
is
the
typical
instruction
unit.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
there
are,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
in
terms
to
the
fact
that
there
are
some
classes
with
--
in
addition
to
27
pupils.
there
are
some
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes,
i
would
say,
but
then
there
are
large
number
of
instructional
units
that
have
less
than
27,
the
exceptional
children
etcetera.
this
is
simply
a
state
balance,
a
state
average,
this
is
a
starting
point.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
glades,
in
terms
of
its
pupil
population.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
glades
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
would
say
dade
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
true.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
true.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
inevitable.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
to
equalize
that
money.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
insofar
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
--
and
in
terms
of
the
total
funding
of
education,
we
are
trying
to
provide
each
child
with
its
nearly
as
equal
economic
education
as
possible.
but
in
direct
response
to
your
question,
in
1969
and
1970,
in
dade
county,
the
average
per
pupil
expenditure
was
$823.79,
the
state
average
was
$728.00.
so
we
recognize
that
it
does
cost
additional
money
problems,
county
to
county
and
the
states
--
rather
from
county
to
county
within
the
state
of
florida
that
it
doesn’t
cost
as
much
perhaps
to
educate
a
child
in
bradford
county
as
it
does
in
dade
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right,
the
transportation
factor,
the
number
of
students
to
be
transported.
obviously,
the
number
of
students
within
the
county,
the
number
of
counties
that
have
exceptional
children
programs.
all
of
the
counties
in
florida
do
not
have
those.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
well,
and
also
there
are
the
impacted
areas
that
are
deriving
funds
on
the
public
law
874
where
they
have
large
military
installation.
actually
in
florida,
we
are
now
spending
about
56
--
or
rather
the
state
is
funding
56%
to
57%
of
the
total
cost
of
public
education.
the
counties
are
only
funding
41%
and
the
federal
government
perhaps
2%
or
3%.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
now
the
law
is
at
presently
reached
mr.
justice
is
that
for
the
next
ensuing
fiscal
year,
there
will
be
a
4-mill
required
effort
on
the
part
of
the
counties.
the
next
year
five,
the
next
year
six,
the
next
year
seven
and
all
years
thereafter.
each
county
will
be
expected
to
raise
at
least
seven
mills
and
that
seven
mills
will
be
figured
into
the
state
funding
formulas
which
is
--
it
is
the
equalizing
funding
point
but
each
county
will
always
be
expected
to
maintain
or
to
levy
mills
for
school
purposes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
to
equalize
of
the
impact
of
tax
mill
per
mill
levy.
the
impact
--
the
tax
impact
per
mill
levy.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
they
can
do
what
they
will
because
at
that
time,
we
will
have
reached
the
goal
that
we
have
set
for
ourselves.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that
is
--
can
go
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no.
you
see,
that
is
the
only
--
they’re
only
required
to
levy
seven
mills
but
they
can
levy
under
the
law
of
ten
mills.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
they
don’t
lose
anything
because
they
do.
that
is
money
that
we
call
the
fact.
they
can
pour
that
back
into
the
frills
of
the
system
if
they’d
like,
but
they
are
not
required
to
levy
anything
in
addition
up
to
ten
mills.
if
the
voters
vote
additional
millage
and
they
want
to
go
up
to
15
mills
for
the
frills,
they
can
do
so.
but
this
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
say
--
i
could
not
say
exactly
what
was
submitted
to
the
state
court,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
you
have
the
entire
record.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
there
is
also,
in
answer
to
your
question
sir,
there
is
also
in
our
brief,
in
the
appellants’
brief,
a
prayer
for
abstention.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
because
there
is
a
case
testing
the
validity
of
this
particular
statute,
this
millage
rollback
act.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
was
going
to
say
in
conclusion
of
my
argument,
i
was
going
to
refer
the
court
to
the
argument
that
we
had
made
for
abstention.
i
wanted
to
get
this
much
as
the
merits
as
i
could
and
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
to
the
argument
that
we
have
already
made
for
abstention,
except
to
say
that
the
case
that
is
testing
the
validity
of
this
vis-à-vis
to
florida
constitution
and
florida
statutes
is
still
a
viable
case.
it
has
not
been
dismissed
although
no
action
has
been
taken
under
it
since
november
i
think.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me.
there
are
different
parties,
yes
sir.
the
questions
are
precisely
--
almost
precisely
the
same.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
i’m
not.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
it
hasn’t
moved
along,
yet
it
is
--
it
has
not
been
dismissed
for
lack
of
prosecution.
now,
the
reason
why
it
has
not
moved
along,
i
could
not
say.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
the
circuit
court
for
leon
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes,
it
is
a
possibility.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
if
i
have
anytime
available,
i
would
like
to
have
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
as
the
court
wishes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
in
all
kind
or
that
the
first
time
that
i
read
the
pleadings
in
this
case
and
the
arguments
of
mr.
shanks’
brief,
i
did
not
then
understand
how
or
if
florida
was
in
fact
discriminating
against
the
school
children.
i
still
do
not.
the
whole
underlying
concept
of
the
minimum
foundation
funding
formula
in
florida
is
a
recognition
of
the
social
economic
fact
that
some
of
florida’s
counties
are
poor
in
relation
to
the
student
numbers
and
some
are
wealthy.
we
go
in
and
with
the
minimum
foundation
funding
formula,
a
complex
series
of
statutes,
we
recognized
that
some
counties
cannot
fund
for
themselves
and
we
are
going
to
see
that
they
can
at
least
give
their
children
a
minimum
acceptable
education.
mr.
shanks
has
indicated
this
morning
that
he
is
focusing
on
a
narrow
or
he’s
making
a
narrow
argument.
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
judge
whether
or
not
florida
is
in
fact
discriminating
against
its
school
children
without
looking
at
the
total
concept
of
the
minimum
foundation
program.
mr.
shanks
has
indicated
in
his
brief
and
in
argument
that
several
of
florida’s
county,
16
i
think
suffered
in
excess
of
$50,000,000.00
loss
because
the
minimum
or
because
the
millage
rollback
act
was
enacted.
in
truth
and
in
fact,
when
they
considered
the
infusion
of
state
moneys
to
make
up
for
those
moneys
that
were
lost,
there
is
an
increase
in
excess
of
$112,000,000.00.
so,
the
counties
have
not
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
minimum
or
rather
of
the
millage
rollback
act.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
in
florida
are
discriminating
against
our
school
children
in
our
poor
counties,
in
fact
and
not
in
theory.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
february
of
1968
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
in
february
of
1968,
we,
in
florida,
underwent
a
rather
disquieting
situation
when
--
in
our
public
schools,
when
roughly
one
half
of
florida
school
teachers
went
out
on
what
they
termed
a
period
of
resignation.
they
blamed
insufficient
state
support
to
the
public
school
systems
for
their
determination
to
do
this.
the
legislature
was
responsive
to
the
plea
of
the
teachers
for
increased
state
funding
and
went
into,
at
the
call
of
the
governor,
to
executive
session
to
remedy
as
best
it
could
at
that
time,
the
inequities
in
public
school
financing
that
existed
at
that
time.
as
a
portion
of
the
legislative
amendments
that
were
passed
in
february
of
1968,
the
so-called
millage
rollback
act,
which
is
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
for
determination
was
enacted.
this
simply
stated
that
millage
rollback
act
told
to
each
county
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
people
within
your
county
vote
for
you
for
public
school
operating
purposes
in
addition
to
10
mills,
you
must
rollback
to
10
mills.
and
when
you
do
so,
we
will
then
guarantee
you
additional
state
funding
in
the
amount
of
at
least
$1,000.
now,
this
is
the
statute
that
is
under
attack.
appellees
contend
that
it
denies
to
florida
school
children
an
equal
economic
educational
opportunity,
which
they
say,
is
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
sources
of
revenue
--
no
sir.
the
sources
of
revenue
are
the
sales
and
use
taxes,
gasoline
taxes
sir.
primarily,
the
sales
tax
is
a
source
of
florida’s
revenue.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
as
i
will
expand
into
this
argument,
a
portion
of
the
property
tax,
a
certain
millage
figure,
is
figured
into
the
state
funding
formula,
but
it
does
not
come
into
the
state
as
such.
the
millage
rollback
act
set
a
10-mill
cap.
in
effect,
telling
the
counties
you
will
not
levy
an
excess
of
10
mills
if
you
want
to
participate
in
minimum
foundation
funding
program.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir
a
max
--
well,
there
were
certain
exceptions
to
the
10
mill
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
but
in
maximum
of
10
mills.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
capital
outlay.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
10-mill
limitation.
it’s
popularly
referred
to
in
florida
or
unpopular
in
some
circles
as
a
cap.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
a
maximum
of
10
mills.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
that
is
real
ad
valorem,
real
property.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
real
and
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right,
it’s
voted
--
that’s
owned
by
individual
citizens.
it’s
just
the
real
property
and
the
--
or
rather
the
tangible
personal
property
in
a
given
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes.
we
are
taxing
the
property
within
the
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes,
the
nonexempt
property.
we
have
a
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
well
--
we
--
there’s
a
constitutional
limitation
on
the
amount
of
personal
property
that
can
be
taxed,
constitution
limit.
and
florida
has
a
$5,000
homestead
exemption.
so
that
homestead
exemption,
that
$5,000,
comes
out
the
top.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
am
of
opinion
that
they
could
your
honor.
that
they
could
--
since
it
grants
the
taxing
power
through
its
legislature
them
i’m
of
the
opinion
that
it
can
identify
sources
that
can
be
utilized
for
public
school
financing
and
we,
in
florida,
in
fact,
do
so.
the
public
schools
in
florida
are
financed
as
a
partnership
between
the
state
and
the
county.
the
argument
made
by
appellees
that
it,
the
operation
of
the
millage
rollback,
act
discriminates
against
the
school
children
in
florida’s
property
poor
counties,
i.e.
property
poor
in
relation
to
their
student
numbers,
would
have
great
appeal
if
the
public
schools
in
florida
were
financed
solely
from
local
ad
valorem
taxes,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
what
this
10-mill
cap
serves
to
do,
or
the
10-mill
maximum
limitations
serves
to
do,
is
to
narrow
the
gap
that
has
historically
existed
in
florida.
an
example,
glades
county
florida,
1-mill
of
tax
applied
to
the
assessment
rules,
glades
county
will
raise
$89.00
and
some
cents
per
student.
and
gadsden
county,
florida,
one
of
florida’s
property
poor
counties,
it
will
only
raise
$8.21.
in
our
brief,
we
have
suggested
that
to
unleash,
as
it
were,
the
taxing
power
of
the
wealthier
school
districts
would
be
as
to
magnify
the
very
inequities
that
the
plaintiffs
or
rather
the
appellee
suggest
that
that
exist.
so,
florida
has,
for
some
years,
realized
that
we
could
not
forever
rely
on
the
property
tax
within
a
given
county.
we
had
to
do
something
at
the
state
level
to
infuse
more
state
dollars
into
education,
public
education.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
socio
--
actually
the
socioeconomic
fact
that
some
counties
are
poor
in
relation
to
their
student
numbers
and
others
are
rich.
glades
county,
the
small
county
that
i’ve
mentioned,
has
844
students.
dade
county,
on
the
other
hand,
has
thousand
and
thousands
of
students.
and
this
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
there
were
two
or
three
affidavits
submitted
at
that
time
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
i
did
not
--
at
that
time
i
was
not
representing
the
state
board
of
education.
it
was
handled
by
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
this
was
included
your
honor,
because
these
facts
at
the
time
were
not
available
to
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
were
very
relevant
and
significant
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes.
yes
it
could
be
made.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
could
not
answer
that
your
honor,
because
as
i
say
was
--
i
did
not
represent
the
state
board
of
education
at
that
time.
if
the
millage
rollback
act
is
considered
in
context
with
other
of
the
legislative
enactments,
the
very
reversed
proposition
that,
as
asserted
by
appellees,
is
the
case.
it
protects
the
school
children
in
florida’s
property
poor
counties
by
bringing
--
by
narrowing
or
bridging
the
gap
that
presently
exists.
appellees
suggest
that
we
might
--
one
way
that
we
might
finance
our
public
education
is
to
give
each
student
in
each
county
a
given
amount
of
dollars.
in
the
reply
brief
that
was
filed
in
this
case,
we
suggested
that
that
sum
be
$400,
and
as
they
are
requesting,
the
millage
rollback
act
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
per
pupil,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
$400.00
will
come
from
the
state.
the
millage
limitation,
the
maximum
--
or
the
cap,
will
be
eliminated
if
the
release
sought
by
appellees
is
afforded.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that
this
is
only
the
state
source.
we
are
going
to
eliminate
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
this
is
what
the
appellees
suggest
that
might
be
done
and
might
be
constitutional.
so,
i
am
taking
their
argument
in
finding
out
just
what
happened
if
we
did
this,
but
assuming
that
we
would
give
$400.00
per
pupil,
to
every
pupil
in
florida,
from
state
source.
or
--
yes,
state
sources,
assuming
then,
no
10-mill
cap,
alright.
if
we
did
this,
florida’s
richest
county
in
terms
of
its
student
population
to
its
assessed
value
or
to
--
yes
to
its
assessed
value
would
have
333%
more
money
with
which
to
educate
its
children
than
the
--
than
the
father
in
florida’s
poorest
county,
gadsden.
so,
the
cap
was
simply
a
transitional
equalizing
device
that
was
placed
on
local
tax
authority
until
such
time.
and
until
--
and
it
will
be
removed.
it
has
been
repealed.
this
very
statute
has
been
repealed
effective
july
1,
1974.
at
which
time
in
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature,
we
will
have
increased
state
support
to
the
basic
funding
unit
of
public
education
that
is
the
instructional
unit.
we
will
have
increased
it
by
50%
above
what
it
is
today.
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
well,
i
think
yes
your
honor
that
the
voters
are
going
to
take
care
of
that
by
themselves
with
regard
to
voting
additional
millage.
we
don’t
feel
that
there
would
be
any
necessity
for
the
cap
at
that
time,
because
we
will
have
funneled
in
such
a
great
proportion
of
state
monies
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
levy
any
substantial
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
the
state
has
recognized
its
burden
under
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
true.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
right.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
on
local
sources.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
instead
of
depending
primarily
on
ad
valorem
tax,
local
property
taxes,
they
now
get
in
taxes
that
are
raised
by
use
taxes,
or
gasoline
tax
or
sales
tax.
the
sources
of
taxes
is
somewhat
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
because
at
the
same
time
the
millage
rollback
act
was
enacted,
there
was
a
pledge
in
the
same
provision
that
farther
would
guarantee,
at
least
for
that
particular
year,
an
additional
$1,000
in
state
sources.
now,
this
act
was
further
amended
in
1970
to
provide
that
for
the
next
four
years,
ending
and
--
at
the
end
of
fiscal
year
in
1974
that
florida
would
infuse
each
year
an
additional
$1,100
into
each
instruction
unit.
so
that
at
that
time
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
still
the
sales
and
use
taxes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
these
are
projections.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
based
on
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
right.
so
by
that
time,
the
instructional
unit,
which
is
the
basic
unit
to
financing
in
florida,
will
have
achieved
the
worth
of
$14,100
per
unit.
it
is
presently
$9,700
per
unit.
and
at
that
time,
we
feel
that
the
state
will
have
acquitted
itself
of
its
responsibility
to
as
nearly
equalize
as
possible
economic
education
opportunity
for
all
of
its
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
an
instruction
on
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
a
statutory
formula
contained
in
the
minimum
foundation
funding
program
body
of
statutes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
an
educational
unit,
if
your
honor
will
permit,
an
educational
unit,
a
typical
educational
unit
in
florida,
is
one
teacher
and
27
pupils
in
the
educational
situation.
now,
that
is
the
typical.
now,
the
value
of
a
given
education
or
rather
unit
of
identified
need
or
an
instructional
unit,
it
does
vary.
for
instance,
an
exceptional
children
in
the
florida
school
for
the
deaf
and
the
blind.
an
instructional,
a
typical
instruction
unit
is
one
teacher
in
five
pupils.
so
--
and
the
value
varies
depending
upon
the
time
in
rates
so
to
speak
of
the
teacher
who
is
teaching
the
unit,
but
on
the
average,
the
typical
unit
is
worth
presently
$9,700.
those
units
are
distributed
throughout
florida
on
an
equal
basis.
there
is
no
--
depending
on
the
number
of
students.
you
divide
the
number
of
students
by
27
and
put
a
teacher
with
them
and
that
is
an
instructional
unit.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
to
the
--
yes
sir.
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
in
answer
to
direct
response
sir,
i
would
suggest
that
there
were
--
the
reason
that
it
was
put
on
there
to
begin
with,
was
as
the
result
of
an
overview
that
there
had
to
be
afforded
to
the
tax
payers
in
some
of
florida’s
counties
ad
valorem
tax
relief.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
say
in
all,
honestly
this
was
--
this
was
a
determination,
but
that
was
not
the
primary
determination
as
far
as
the
cap
was
concerned.
we
had
long
been
concerned
in
florida
with
the
fact
that
some
counties
could
raise
and
could
infuse
local
funds
into
their
system
greatly
in
excess
of
the
ability
of
other
counties
to
do
the
same
thing.
and
while
we
were
attempting
to
equalize,
equalize
education
--
economic
educational
opportunity,
it
was
felt
that
a
cap
would
be
the
prudent
thing.
now,
to
take
the
cap
away
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
if
i
may
sir
go
back
to
one
point
and
then
perhaps
i
can
respond
more
fully
to
your
query.
the
way
that
we
arrive
at
how
much
money
is
going
to
be
spent
in
the
florida
public
schools
each
year,
is
done
statutorily.
but
identified
units
of
need
are
first
compiled.
that
gives
us
a
figure
of
how
much
education
in
florida
is
going
to
cost
us
this
year.
the
states
are
required,
as
part
of
what
we
call
local
effort,
it’s
their
local
effort
to
levy
at
least
for
this
year
four
mills.
it’s
either
three
or
four
this
year.
but
whatever
that
amount
of
money
will
raise
on
the
tax
role
of
that
individual
county
is
subtracted
from
the
additive,
the
units
of
need.
and
the
remainder
there
is
what
the
state
will
be
required
to
put
into
that
particular
county.
as
a
part
of
the
1970
equalization
act,
all
counties
are
--
or
rather
it
was
mandated
by
the
legislature
that
each
county
--
the
auditor
general
of
florida
would
conduct
a
so-called
racial
study
to
find
out
what
the
assessment
practices
were
in
the
several
states.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
counties.
the
counties,
there
has
always
historically
in
florida
been
wide
variation
in
assessment
practices.
i’m
certain
it’s
not
unusual
in
florida.
but
there
was
--
this
was
also
at
the
time
the
millage
rollback
act
was
--
or
at
the
following
year.
this
review
was
mandated
and
in
attempt
to
find
out
who
was
assessing
fairly
and
who
was
not
assessing
fairly,
because
we
had
traditionally,
we
had
traditionally
rewarded
those
counties
for
bad
assessment
practices
by
given
them
additional
state
monies.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
that
is
the
direction
that
we
are
moving
in
florida
as
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir
i
don’t
--
i
think
it
wasn’t
part
of
political
decision.
i
think
it
was
a
decision
that
was
made
as
a
result
of
what
we
saw
could
happen
to
the
public
schools
in
florida
with
great
dissatisfaction
among
our
parents
and
among
our
teachers.
and
it
was
this
sad
occurrence
that
focused
the
attention
on
the
need
for
additional
state
participation
in
the
funding
process.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that
is
the
typical
instruction
unit.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
there
are,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
in
terms
to
the
fact
that
there
are
some
classes
with
--
in
addition
to
27
pupils.
there
are
some
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes,
i
would
say,
but
then
there
are
large
number
of
instructional
units
that
have
less
than
27,
the
exceptional
children
etcetera.
this
is
simply
a
state
balance,
a
state
average,
this
is
a
starting
point.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
glades,
in
terms
of
its
pupil
population.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
glades
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
would
say
dade
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
true.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
true.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
inevitable.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
to
equalize
that
money.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
insofar
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
the
--
and
in
terms
of
the
total
funding
of
education,
we
are
trying
to
provide
each
child
with
its
nearly
as
equal
economic
education
as
possible.
but
in
direct
response
to
your
question,
in
1969
and
1970,
in
dade
county,
the
average
per
pupil
expenditure
was
$823.79,
the
state
average
was
$728.00.
so
we
recognize
that
it
does
cost
additional
money
problems,
county
to
county
and
the
states
--
rather
from
county
to
county
within
the
state
of
florida
that
it
doesn’t
cost
as
much
perhaps
to
educate
a
child
in
bradford
county
as
it
does
in
dade
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right,
the
transportation
factor,
the
number
of
students
to
be
transported.
obviously,
the
number
of
students
within
the
county,
the
number
of
counties
that
have
exceptional
children
programs.
all
of
the
counties
in
florida
do
not
have
those.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
well,
and
also
there
are
the
impacted
areas
that
are
deriving
funds
on
the
public
law
874
where
they
have
large
military
installation.
actually
in
florida,
we
are
now
spending
about
56
--
or
rather
the
state
is
funding
56%
to
57%
of
the
total
cost
of
public
education.
the
counties
are
only
funding
41%
and
the
federal
government
perhaps
2%
or
3%.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
now
the
law
is
at
presently
reached
mr.
justice
is
that
for
the
next
ensuing
fiscal
year,
there
will
be
a
4-mill
required
effort
on
the
part
of
the
counties.
the
next
year
five,
the
next
year
six,
the
next
year
seven
and
all
years
thereafter.
each
county
will
be
expected
to
raise
at
least
seven
mills
and
that
seven
mills
will
be
figured
into
the
state
funding
formulas
which
is
--
it
is
the
equalizing
funding
point
but
each
county
will
always
be
expected
to
maintain
or
to
levy
mills
for
school
purposes.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that’s
right.
to
equalize
of
the
impact
of
tax
mill
per
mill
levy.
the
impact
--
the
tax
impact
per
mill
levy.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
they
can
do
what
they
will
because
at
that
time,
we
will
have
reached
the
goal
that
we
have
set
for
ourselves.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
that
is
--
can
go
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no.
you
see,
that
is
the
only
--
they’re
only
required
to
levy
seven
mills
but
they
can
levy
under
the
law
of
ten
mills.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
they
don’t
lose
anything
because
they
do.
that
is
money
that
we
call
the
fact.
they
can
pour
that
back
into
the
frills
of
the
system
if
they’d
like,
but
they
are
not
required
to
levy
anything
in
addition
up
to
ten
mills.
if
the
voters
vote
additional
millage
and
they
want
to
go
up
to
15
mills
for
the
frills,
they
can
do
so.
but
this
--
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
i
say
--
i
could
not
say
exactly
what
was
submitted
to
the
state
court,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
you
have
the
entire
record.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
there
is
also,
in
answer
to
your
question
sir,
there
is
also
in
our
brief,
in
the
appellants’
brief,
a
prayer
for
abstention.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
because
there
is
a
case
testing
the
validity
of
this
particular
statute,
this
millage
rollback
act.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
was
going
to
say
in
conclusion
of
my
argument,
i
was
going
to
refer
the
court
to
the
argument
that
we
had
made
for
abstention.
i
wanted
to
get
this
much
as
the
merits
as
i
could
and
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
to
the
argument
that
we
have
already
made
for
abstention,
except
to
say
that
the
case
that
is
testing
the
validity
of
this
vis-à-vis
to
florida
constitution
and
florida
statutes
is
still
a
viable
case.
it
has
not
been
dismissed
although
no
action
has
been
taken
under
it
since
november
i
think.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me.
there
are
different
parties,
yes
sir.
the
questions
are
precisely
--
almost
precisely
the
same.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
no
sir,
i’m
not.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
it
hasn’t
moved
along,
yet
it
is
--
it
has
not
been
dismissed
for
lack
of
prosecution.
now,
the
reason
why
it
has
not
moved
along,
i
could
not
say.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
the
circuit
court
for
leon
county.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
yes,
it
is
a
possibility.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
if
i
have
anytime
available,
i
would
like
to
have
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
as
the
court
wishes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
miner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
in
all
kind
or
that
the
first
time
that
i
read
the
pleadings
in
this
case
and
the
arguments
of
mr.
shanks’
brief,
i
did
not
then
understand
how
or
if
florida
was
in
fact
discriminating
against
the
school
children.
i
still
do
not.
the
whole
underlying
concept
of
the
minimum
foundation
funding
formula
in
florida
is
a
recognition
of
the
social
economic
fact
that
some
of
florida’s
counties
are
poor
in
relation
to
the
student
numbers
and
some
are
wealthy.
we
go
in
and
with
the
minimum
foundation
funding
formula,
a
complex
series
of
statutes,
we
recognized
that
some
counties
cannot
fund
for
themselves
and
we
are
going
to
see
that
they
can
at
least
give
their
children
a
minimum
acceptable
education.
mr.
shanks
has
indicated
this
morning
that
he
is
focusing
on
a
narrow
or
he’s
making
a
narrow
argument.
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
judge
whether
or
not
florida
is
in
fact
discriminating
against
its
school
children
without
looking
at
the
total
concept
of
the
minimum
foundation
program.
mr.
shanks
has
indicated
in
his
brief
and
in
argument
that
several
of
florida’s
county,
16
i
think
suffered
in
excess
of
$50,000,000.00
loss
because
the
minimum
or
because
the
millage
rollback
act
was
enacted.
in
truth
and
in
fact,
when
they
considered
the
infusion
of
state
moneys
to
make
up
for
those
moneys
that
were
lost,
there
is
an
increase
in
excess
of
$112,000,000.00.
so,
the
counties
have
not
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
minimum
or
rather
of
the
millage
rollback
act.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
in
florida
are
discriminating
against
our
school
children
in
our
poor
counties,
in
fact
and
not
in
theory.
