justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
share
of
the
property
tax
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
--
was
proceeding
in
the
district
court
below
just
a
common
place
in
the
pleadings?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
affidavits
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
sort
of
a
presentation
at
the
three-judge
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
rest
of
the
table,
11
to
13
i
believe
(inaudible)
?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
the
florida
--
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
very
relevant
and
significant.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
argument
you’re
making,
does
that
made
up
of
the
exact
figures.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
what
purpose
of
the
legislature
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
the
consequences
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
per
pupil?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
it
would
remove
any
temptation
over
tax
properties?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
consequence
the
mill
limit
was
to
redistribute
the
burden
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
--
even
if
it
didn’t
reduce
the
amount
of
per
pupil
expenditures
below
an
acceptable
figure.
even
such
to
do
that,
it
did
redistribute
the
burden
of
dividing
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
in
terms
of
the
--
the
state
doesn’t
have
any
money
except
what
it
gets
from
other
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
they
redistributed
the
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
of
the
property
holders
to
the
people
who
take
the
other
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
that
i
gather
is
that
the
poor
counties
didn’t
have
that
much,
that
was
you
position,
the
contribution
in
taxes
from
other
sources,
which
enables
that
to
poor
counties
to
give
a
better
quality
education
when
they
did
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
have
to
rely
primarily
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
personal
property
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
still
have
some
trouble
and
wondering
why
you
needed
the
typical
limit,
because
you’re
going
to
go
away
with
it,
because
you
wouldn’t
need
this
as
soon
as
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know
why
you
get
the
10-mill
limit
on
during
the
transition
period,
if
you
could
let
that
off,
still
build
up
state
aid
and
local
governments
with
the
tax
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
they
can
put
up
the
limit
taxes,
they
are
going
to
be
assessed
by
the
assessment
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn’t
need
to
limit
the
richer
counties
of
10
mills
or
the
poorer
counties
of
10
mills
in
florida
to
bring
up
the
poorer
counties
to,
at
this
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
after
the
10-mill
limit
goes
off,
the
local,
all
those
counties
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
raised
their
--
to
the
extent
they
have
raised
their
mill
levy
on
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
amount
of
dollars
--
amount
of
dollars
state
aid
had
reduced.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
you
must
--
your
argument
has
to
go
insofar
as
to
say
that
a
state
may
not
limit
the
amount
of
educational
support
that
is
to
be
derived
from
proper
taxes
and
substitute
for
that
support,
other
revenue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
you
--
because
the
state
says
take
no
more
than
10
mills,
don’t
burden
property
owners
any
more
than
10
mills
as
part
of
education
because
we’re
going
to
make
that
sum
from
other
sources.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you’re
saying,
your
saying
that
the
state’s
equalization
program
isn’t
satisfactory?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
this
program
they
have
of
pouring
more
money
in
equalizing
education
opportunity
still
denies
equal
protection
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
really
then
involves
the
whole
picture
of
all
states
to
afford
to
pay
education
which
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
the
district
court
had
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
you
would
also
have
to
say
that
the
state,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
remove
the
taxing
power
from
all
counties
and
school
districts
and
the
state
itself
assess
and
levy
the
property
tax
and
if
it
just
levied
the
property
tax
at
10
mills
right
across
the
board,
you
would
say
that
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
share
of
the
property
tax
of
the
state?
justice
byron

was
