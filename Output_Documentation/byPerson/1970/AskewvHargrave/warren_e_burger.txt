well,
this

on
geographical
factors,
the
extensive
travel

all
of
that
sort
of
stuff
then.

e.

mr.
shanks,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shanks,
would
you
be
that
after
hearing
mr.
miner’s
argument
and
reading
his
brief
that
there’s
quite
a
lot
of
material
here
which
was
not
before
the
three-judge
court
in
florida?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
what
you
really
mean
is
that
some
of
the
taxpayers
in
those
counties
have
that
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don’t
know
from
anything
of
this
record
what
their
views
really
are
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
mr.
shanks
with
regards
to
what
justice
white
and
i
were
both
enquiring
about
as
to
what
was
before
the
district
court
and
was
not?
in
mr.
miners
brief
at
pages
i
think
11
and
onward,
there
are
some
figures
that
are
certainly
very
interesting
and
intriguing
if
not
very
crucial
to
this
case.
now,
my
impression
is
that
these
figures
were
not
before
the
district
court
is
that
right?

mr.
white’s
--mr.
justice
white’s
suggestion
that
if
the
state
took
this
entire
operation
over

eliminated

the

do
precisely
that,

misunderstand
you?
