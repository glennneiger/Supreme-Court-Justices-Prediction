justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
miner,
where
does
the
state
as
such
get
its
funds
to
make
up
$1,000
you
referred
to?
does
florida
have
an
income
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
miner,
there’s
a
lot
of
talking
to
briefs
too
about
counties
taxing
themselves.
the
voters
voting
to
tax
themselves.
i
suppose
what
it
really
means,
translated
is,
that
it’s
taxing
their
property
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
it
will
be
corporate
property?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
real
property?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
might
be
owned
by
nonvoting
corporations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
it’s
a
bit
of
a
euphemism
to
say
that
the
voters
vote
to
tax
themselves
in
terms?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
for
the
personal
staff,
could
florida
remove
constitutionally
the
county
power
to
tax,
do
you
think,
and
take
it
onto
it
because
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
miner,
let
me
be
sure
of
one
thing
that
florida
isn’t
aiming
to
the
point
where
there
will
be
no
county
contribution
to
the
board
of
education.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
counsel
in
that
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
case
has
been
dead,
it
hasn’t
moved
along.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
is
it?
in
the
florida
trial
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
the
litigants
there
are
waiting
on
with
this
case.
there
is
a
possibility,
isn’t
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that’s
a
possibility,
isn’t
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
very
well.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
fine.
would
you
prefer
not
to
divide
your
argument
or
would
you
--
is
it
acceptable
to
open
now?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
we
may
open
it.
