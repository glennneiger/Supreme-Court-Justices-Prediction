mr.
hershel
shanks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
true
mr.
justice
brennan
that
in
the
reply
brief
in
this
court,
the
appellants
have
i
think
raised
a
new
justification
for
the
millage
rollback
act.
however,
we
feel
that
we’re
prepared
to
meet
that
here
and
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
stand
--
send
the
case
back.
this
is
essentially
a
statistical
case
and
certain
things
are
necessarily
so.
the
argument
that
they
make
here
for
the
first
time
in
their
reply
brief,
i
think
puts
the
best
light
on
the
millage
rollback
act
that
can
be
put
on
it.
previously,
it
appeared
that
the
millage
rollback
act
had
been
passed
as
a
basis
to
certain
powerful
property
interests
as
a
tradeoff,
so
that
they
would
support
legislation
increasing
state
funding
of
education.
and
our
argument
was
that
a
wealth
discrimination,
a
limitation
that
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
wealth
was
an
unconstitutional
price
to
pay
for
the
increased
state
funding.
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
are
freeholders,
parents
and
students
from
16
counties
who
have
been
adversely
affected
by
the
millage
rollback
act.
mr.
hershel
shanks
prior
to
the
millage
rollback
act,
they
had
voted
to
tax
themselves,
their
properties
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
at
a
higher
rate
than
is
allowed
in
the
millage
rollback
act,
so
that
when
the
--
this
was
a
two-year
authorization.
all
that
was
needed
was
the
vote
of
a
school
board
to
assess
and
levy.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
i
think
that
they
--
on
the
whole,
they’re
from
relatively
poor
counties,
but
i
think
it
extends
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
go
above
the
10-mill
limit.
it
depends
not
only
on
how
poor
they
are,
how
rich
they
are
but
also
on
what
kind
of
an
effort
they
want
to
make.
and
if
they’re
poor,
they
have
to
make
a
greater
effort,
but
sometimes,
some
of
the
middle
range
counties
maybe
willing
to
make
more
of
an
effort
too.
but
these
counties
all
did
tax
themselves
at
a
higher
rate
before
fell
back
as
they
were
required
to
do
by
the
millage
rollback
act
and
in
one
case,
the
school
board
said
it
couldn’t
produce
a
budget
with
the
ten
mills
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
hershel
shanks
personally
i’m
just
not
sure.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
i
don’t
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
i’m
just
not
sure
of
the
locations
of
broward
county.
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes
sir.
mr.
hershel
shanks
but
our
question
--
our
point
is
really
a
relative
one.
a
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
they
are
prevented
as
--
they
are
really
asserting
a
right
of
a
county
in
the
same
way
as
in
gray
v.
sanders,
where
the
disadvantaged
voters
were
asserting
the
right
of
the
county.
these
people
come
from
the
counties
which
have
voted
higher
taxes
and
i
think
it’s
a
fair
assumption
not
on
the
case
of
broward
county
but
in
the
case
of
other
counties
where
they
have
been
collecting
higher
taxes.
and
then
they
fall
back
and
they
don’t
fall
back
to
let’s
say
nine-and-a-half
or
nine,
they
fall
back
right
to
that
limit.
and
i
think
it’s
a
fair
assumption
that
when
you
have
a
higher
tax
rate
that
falls
back
just
to
the
limit,
immediately
after
the
limit
is
opposed
--
imposed
that
this
limitation
is
an
effective
limitation
on
what
they
would
otherwise
be
doing.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
that’s
not
our
argument.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct
and
our
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
our
basic
position
is
that
a
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
i’m
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
precisely
so.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
in
other
words,
they’re
willing
to
--
i
think
if
we
look
at
it
as
tax
authorization
that
the
state
is
actually
giving.
and
if
they
give
the
rich
man
or
the
rich
county
more
than
the
poor
county,
then
that
is
denial
of
equal
protection.
and
our
position
is
that
a
flat
rate
limitation
that
is
ten
mills
does
operate
unequally,
because
in
the
rich
county,
it
authorizes
or
gives
to
the
counties
an
authorization
to
tax
themselves
to
the
extent
of
$750
a
pupil
whereas
in
the
poorer
counties,
it’s
limited
to
$50
a
pupil.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that
raises
a
very
important
point,
your
honor.
there
are
two
elements
of
disparity
which
i
think
conceptually
it’s
important
to
keep
in
mind.
some
of
the
disparity
between
the
--
per
child
in
miami
beach
and
the
child
in
panhandle
result
in
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
child’s
parents
or
the
taxpayers
in
palm
beach
or
miami
beach
can
afford
more.
and
this
case
is
not
raising
squarely
that
issue.
that
issue
is
raised
in
(inaudible)
that
we
discussed
in
our
brief.
but
the
other
kind
of
unequal
treatment
is
where
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no
i
don’t
you
honor
and
i
--
and
we’re
not
contending
in
this
case
but
that’s
what
must
be
done.
we
are
simply
asking
for
the
same
--
we’re
not
even
opposing
a
limitation.
we
are
just
opposing
an
unequal
limitation,
so
that
across
the
board
limitations
--
we
are
quite
--
we
believe
that’s
constitutional.
mr.
hershel
shanks
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hershel
shanks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
this
morning
by
noting
that
there
are
many
aspects
of
the
florida
educational
financing
system
which
are
very
fine
indeed
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
good
we
applaud,
but
there
is
one
element
in
this
system
which
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
wealth
and
to
that
extent
we
attack
it
is
unconstitutional.
basically,
the
florida
system
is
this,
the
state
distributes
to
each
of
the
counties
on
a
very
fair
and
well
considered
basis,
a
major
portion
of
the
funds
to
finance
a
school
system.
now,
i
am
willing
to
assume
here
contrary
to
present
fact
that
this
is
sufficient
to
fund
an
adequate
educational
system.
added
to
this
basic
grant
and
on
top
of
this
is
the
amount
that
the
local
counties
add
through
their
local
tax
effort.
now,
i’m
even
willing
to
assume
here
that
this
added
amount
is
an
educational
frosting.
mr.
hershel
shanks
frosting
on
the
cake
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
in
other
words,
its
something
additional
which
the
--
i
don’t
think
in
fact
of
this
but
i’m
willing
to
assume
that
in
here.
but
we
insist
that
even
the
frosting
be
distributed
on
an
equal
basis
that
is
without
discrimination
based
on
wealth.
the
millage
rollback
act
together
with
the
statutes
which
authorized
florida
counties
to
tax,
create
a
system
where
they
give
to
each
county
a
certain
authority
to
add
this
educational
frosting,
to
raise
these
dollars.
in
some
counties,
it’s
$700.00
a
pupil.
in
other
counties,
it’s
$6.00,
$5.00,
$4.00
and
down
to
$50.00
a
pupil.
each
is
treated
less
well
depending
as
it
goes
down
the
wealth
scale
so
that
it’s
not
a
question
of
only
two
categories,
it’s
a
sliding
scale
and
everybody
but
the
top
county
is
disadvantaged.
now,
we
are
not
opposed
to
limitations
as
such
on
local
effort.
we
don’t
even
insist
on
a
particular
formula
that
the
limitation
should
take.
there
are
variety
of
constitutional
formulas,
for
example,
a
florida
could
in
its
wisdom
say
that
each
county
will
be
limited
to
a
$100.00
a
pupil
or
could
say
each
county
could
be
--
would
be
limited
to
a
$1,000.00
in
instruction
unit
of
the
instruction
unit
as
was
discussed
yesterday
is
a
very
complicated
formula
which
takes
into
account
a
myriad
of
factors,
it
could
take
--
if
there
are
infinite
number
of
reasonable
formulas
for
determining
instruction
units,
to
take
account
of
any
reasonable
difference
in
educational
need,
transportation,
exceptional
children,
guidance
programs,
anything
so
that
we
wouldn’t
object
to
any
limitation
which
applied
without
regard
to
wealth
which
was
reasonably
related
to
the
responsibility
which
each
of
the
local
communities
has
and
if
they
have
the
same
responsibility,
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
must
give
them
the
same
tools
to
meet
that
responsibility.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that
your
honor
would
depend
on
a
number
of
considerations.
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
probably
would
but
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
--
i
can’t
be
sure
--
the
considerations
would
be
this
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
--
yes,
the
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
a
single
tax
rate
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
probably
would,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
there
would
be
a
number
of
different
factors
but
it
would
be
related
to
the
justice
in
this
case,
it
would
be
related
to
the
wealth
of
the
community
rather
than
the
responsibility
to
the
community,
the
task
that
they
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
would
be
unconstitutional
given
the
--
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
as
it
probably
could
that
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
that
it’s
equal
on
its
face,
it’s
equal
and
that
it
says
that
the
same
number,
flat
tax
rate
is
applicable
but
i
think
the
court
must
ask
the
question,
how
does
this
operate,
does
it
operate
equally
or
unequally.
let
me,
if
i
may
put
a
hypothetical.
instead
of
--
in
this
case
where
we
have
the
state
giving
to
the
local
communities
tax
authorization,
let’s
consider
the
case
where
the
state
was
giving
money
for
educational
purposes
and
suppose
that
the
formula
which
that
they
distributed
money
was
the
same
as
they
distribute
tax
authority
in
this
case.
and
suppose
that
the
state
of
florida
said
that
we
will
give
to
each
county
10
mills,
a
percentage
of
its
tax
base
for
educational
purposes
and
there’s
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
court
would
strike
that
down
nine
to
nothing.
that
has
no
relationship
to
the
educational
task
that
the
counties
are
required
to
undertake.
now,
the
state
of
florida
in
its
presentation
nor
in
its
briefs
has
suggested
a
single
reason
why
an
equal
limitation.
if
an
equal
limitation
--
if
they
want
a
limitation,
why
an
equal
limitation
would
not
serve
all
of
its
purposes?
the
state
suggested
yesterday
that
the
millage
rollback
act
narrows
the
gap
between
the
poor
counties
and
the
rich
counties.
i
think
it
is
obviously
true
that
it
narrows
the
potential
gap
that
is
to
say
that
there’s
a
limit
of
10
mils
on
each
county,
the
potential
gap
is
less
than
if
there’s
a
limitation
of
15
mills
and
a
limitation
of
15
mills
creates
less
of
a
potential
gap
than
no
limitation
at
all
but
the
question
that
we
urge
on
the
court
is
not
the
validity
of
a
limitation,
it’s
the
validity
of
unequal
wealth
related
limitation
expressed
as
a
flat
rate
tax
limitation.
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
am
familiar
with
it
to
the
extent
that
i
have
seen
the
pleadings
and
i
have
talked
to
counsel,
its
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
the
questions
that
are
raised
under
the
state
constitution
mr.
justice
brennan
are
--
that
the
millage
rollback
act
violates
the
provision
of
florida
law
which
says
that
adequate
provision
shall
be
made
by
law
for
a
uniform
system
of
free
public
schools,
another
provisions
which
says
that
all
natural
persons
are
equal
before
the
law
and
have
an
--
rights
and
another
provision
which
i
think
is
even
weaker,
its
rather
complicated,
but
our
position
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that
is
correct
your
honor,
our
position
here
is
that
we
are
suing
under
1983
and
we
have
a
right
to
come
to
a
federal
forum
with
our
federal
claim,
we
have
pressed
only
federal
claims,
i
believe
the
position
that
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
pardon
me?
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
i
believe
that
that
is
the
teaching
in
monroe
v
pape
as
i
read
it
and
the
suggestion
that
a
state
law
issue
or
a
state
constitutional
issue
maybe
a
ground
for
abstention
was
rejected
by
this
court
just
last
month
in
wisconsin
against
constantineau
where
mr.
chief
justice
burger
dissenting
urged
that
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
grounds
your
honor,
i
think
there’s
several
others.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
ambiguity
here
in
the
statute
itself
in
the
millage
rollback
act,
there’s
no
conceivable
vagueness
or
other
way
that
it
could
be
interpreted
that
would
change
the
constitutional
question
here.
moreover,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
that
realistically
speaking,
of
course
it
has
been
tested
but
as
a
lawyer
assessing
a
case,
i
would
say
that
you
would
be
plowing
all
new
ground
under
the
florida
constitution
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
no,
i
say
a
lawyer
would
be,
the
florida
courts
would
be.
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
--
there’s
a
kind
of
guidelines
existing
in
florida
constitutional
law.
mr.
hershel
shanks
raise
--
no,
they
wouldn’t
be
raised
in
the
defense
rather
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
were
not
pressed
by
us.
mr.
hershel
shanks
we
--
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
did
put
in
our
complaint
or
one
of
this
grounds
we
never
referred
to
it
again
though
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
we
never
really,
it
was
quite
candidly,
when
we’re
drafting
a
complaint,
we
try
to
put
everything
conceivable
in.
at
the
--
as
we
press
forward
in
litigation
and
we
assess
our
chances
on
each
--
i
think
we
concluded
that
this
was
not
a
realistically
possibility
of
obtaining
relief
on
this
ground
and
we
are
pressing
only
our
federal
ground
as
we
think
we
have
the
right
to
do
under
monroe
against
pape
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
was
not
before
the
three-judge
court
in
florida
your
honor
is
the
argument
that
this
statute
may
possibly
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
it
narrows
the
gap
and
that
argument
i
think
is
very
easily
met,
the
answer
to
it
is
we
have
no
objection
to
your
trying
to
narrow
the
gap,
all
we
have
objection
to,
is
when
you
do
it
in
an
--
by
imposing
an
unequal
wealth
discrimination.
there’s
an
analogy
i
think
in
this
case
to
1245
against
florida
and
which
mr.
justice
stewart
i
believe
wrote
the
opinion
where
there
was
an
attempt
by
florida,
the
same
state
to
suppress
extramarital
promiscuity
and
the
court
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
excuse
me;
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
in
which
the
court
indicated
there
was
perfectly
proper
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
florida
to
do
something
about
extramarital,
premarital
promiscuity
but
they
said
don’t
do
it
by
drawing
a
racial
line
and
its
--
the
analogy
here
is
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
states
imposing
limitation,
if
that’s
what
they
want
to
do
but
don’t
do
it
by
a
wealth
discriminating
limitation.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
that’s
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
if
they
make
up
the
sums
from
other
sources,
in
other
words,
suppose
a
county
says
aright,
we
would
normally
--
there’s
another
county
here
that’s
raising
a
$150.00
a
pupil
but
the
$10.00
in
our
county,
10
mills
in
our
county
only
raises
a
$100.00
a
pupil
and
if
we
were
free,
if
you
treated
us
equally
with
the
other
county,
we
would
therefore
raise
a
$150.00.
mr.
hershel
shanks
if
the
state
says
we’ll
make
that
$50.00
up
to
you
so
that
you
really
are
being
treated
equally,
that
would
be
alright.
the
only
thing
we
object
to
is
the
unequal
treatment,
we
don’t
know.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
well,
that’s
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
respectfully
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it
does
not
because
the
only
thing
that
is
necessary
to
examine
is
the
millage
rollback
act
to
see
whether
it
operates
equally
and
if
it
does
not,
is
there
something
which
equalizes
the
operation
and
the
state
hasn’t
appointed
to
anything
which
equalizes
the
operation.
if
the
state
--
all
the
state
has
said
is
that
well,
we
poured
in
more
money
on
a
fair
basis,
yes
they
have
poured
in
more
money
on
a
fair
basis.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
no,
that
would
be
constitutional.
it’s
not
how
you
get
the
money,
it’s
how
you
give
it
back.
in
other
words,
if
the
state
levy
to
10
mill
or
20
mill
or
30
mill
property
tax
throughout
florida,
there’d
be
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that.
what
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
took
that
money
and
distributed
it
on
the
basis
of
wealth.
and
here,
were
talking
-
there’s
a
big
difference
and
i
think
its
important
to
maintain
the
distinction
between
getting
the
money
in
whether
the
state
is
treating
someone
equally
in
the
way
its
taxing,
from
a
taxpayers
point
of
view
and
on
the
other
hand,
whether
the
state
is
distributing
its
large
or
its
benefits
unequally
here.
and
here,
we
claim
that
the
state
is
distributing
its
benefits
unequally,
not
money
but
in
this
case
authority
to
tax,
and
i
think
it
is
a
discrete
part
of
the
taxing
system
in
florida
and
of
course
it
could
be
met
if
florida
was
to
come
in
here
and
say
yes,
its
true
that
it
does
operate
unequally
but
we
have
made
it
up
by
this.
now,
they
haven’t
come
in
and
said
that
and
that’s
why
i
don’t
think
mr.
justice
white
that
it’s
necessary
to
examine
anymore
of
the
florida
system.
mr.
hershel
shanks
in
that
case
mr.
justice
marshall,
property
maybe
a
measure
of
the
need
for
fire
prevention.
in
other
words,
there
maybe
a
relationship
between
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
don’t
know,
you’re
getting
into
borderline
cases,
but
if
there
is
no
--
in
education
there
is
demonstrably
no
relationship
between
property
and
need.
we
have
shown
in
the
record
here
that
the
--
that
the
tax
base
varies
between
--
between
$5,000.00
a
pupil
and
$72,000.00
a
pupil,
so
that
there’s
no
relationship
whatever.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct,
i’d
like
to
go
back
to
something
you
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all
and
i’d
like
to
comment
on
that
if
i
may
because
i
think
it’s
important.
there
are
--
as
your
honor
noted
yesterday,
there
are
variations
in
almost
every
state,
i
think
hawaii
is
the
only
exception
between
the
rich
districts
and
the
poor
districts
and
that
is
because
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
and
we
are
not
urging
equality,
all
we
are
urging
is
a
negative
proposition
that
you
can’t
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
wealth.
there
--
we
don’t
believe
that
a
plaintiff
meets
his
case
simply
by
showing
for
example
that
i’ve
got
a
school
bill
five
years
ago
and
you’ve
got
a
school
bill
just
last
year.
we
say
that
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
is
to
establish
that
there
has
been
a
discrimination
based
--
an
invidious
discrimination
on
race
or
wealth
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i’m
obviously
defacing
myself
in
trying
to
explain
it.
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
a
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
what
--
the
state
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
the
equalization
fund
operates
in
this
way.
the
state
gives
--
determines
the
total
amount
of
an
adequate
system
by
a
formula
and
there
is
one
equalization
element
which
my
brother
miner
touched
upon
which
works
this
way.
one
element
of
the
total
picture
is
they
determine
how
much
would
be
raised
by
four
mills
tax
in
the
local
taxing
unit.
and
then
there’s
an
x
figure
up
here
and
they
take
whatever
is
raised
by
four
mills,
the
state
will
makeup
up
to
x.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
right.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
right.
now,
between
four
and
10,
the
state
--
the
local
district
is
free
to
add
its
own
tax
effort.
mr.
hershel
shanks
up
to
10
and
that
is
where
we
say
that
inevitably
and
necessarily
and
inequity
is
a
discrimination
by
wealth
has
built
in
because
they
say
to
the
one
county,
alright
you
can
tax
an
additional
six
mils
over
the
four
and
whatever
that
is
you
can
add
it
to
your
system
and
whatever
--
given
the
fact
that
there’s
a
wide
variation
in
tax
based
per
pupil,
the
inevitable
result
is
that
in
one
county,
they
can
add
four
or
$500.00
per
pupil
and
the
other
county
is
prevented
from
doing
the
very
same
thing.
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes
your
honor,
there
were
24
counties.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
most
important
table
in
the
case
which
appears
at
the
--
in
the
appendix
at
25
and
26
and
that
is
unfortunately
in
small
type
but
it
has
got
a
lot
of
numbers
in
it
and
shows
that
24
counties
which
prior
to
the
millage
rollback
act
were
taxing
at
up
to
17
and
18
mills.
mr.
hershel
shanks
there
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
there
is
no
line
your
honor,
everybody
below
the
richest
man
is
poor
in
a
relative
sense.
in
other
word,
this
is
a
discrimination
by
wealth.
when
you
--
if
the
state
gives
one
county
authority
to
tax
$700.00
and
another
one
$600.00,
the
one
at
$600.00
--
that’s
getting
$600.00
maybe
what
we
would
normally
call
pretty
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
--well
to
do
country
but
is
still
discriminated
against
compared
to
the
$700.00.
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
we’d
have
to
examine
each
case
and
maybe
in
some
of
this
case,
something
should
be
done
about
it
your
honor.
i’m
trying
to
make
a
very
narrow
attack
here
on
a
very
clear
discrimination
that
the
statute
imposes
that
doesn’t
result
from
the
fact
that
they
are
poor
and
can’t
afford
it,
they’re
willing
to
tax
themselves
at
a
higher
rate,
they’re
willing
to
raise
more
money
for
their
children
but
this
statute
prevents
them
from
doing
so.
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
cannot
do
what
some
of
the
taxpayers
in
wealthier
counties
can
do.
mr.
hershel
shanks
we
know
that
they’re
denied
the
same
rights
as
the
taxpayers
in
a
neighboring
wealthier
county.
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
were
not
before
because
they
--
could
not
before
--
be
before
them
at
the
time
because
they
occurred
afterward,
and
all
they
represent
your
honor
is
the
additions
that
the
state
has
distributed
to
the
counties
on
a
fair
basis
and
we
don’t
contest
that,
we
acknowledge
that
the
state
has
distributed
to
the
monofair
basis
and
increase
the
funds.
the
only
thing
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
only
thing
that
we
attack
is
that
narrow
area
above
the
basic
state
grant
which
is
a
grant
of
authority
to
the
counties
to
help
themselves
and
we
say
that
grant
of
authority
is
unequal
one
because
it’s
based
on
how
rich
you
are.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
you
did,
i’m
sorry
to
have
given
that
impression
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
the
state
could
tax
at
10
mills,
that
part
is
alright,
the
taxing
part,
but
it
couldn’t
take
that
money
and
distribute
it
on
the
basis
of
how
rich
the
counties
were.
it
doesn’t
distribute,
for
example,
it
takes
the
sales
and
used
tax
where
it
gets
most
of
the
money
to
support
the
public
schools.
it
takes
that
sales
and
used
tax
but
it
doesn’t
give
it
back
to
the
counties
on
the
basis
of
where
the
money
came
from,
it
has
a
formula
which
is
related
to
the
educational
needs
of
the
varying
counties,
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
50%
of
it
came
from
dade
county.
dade
county
doesn’t
get
50%,
it
gets
it
in
terms
of
a
formula
related
to
need
and
if
they
tax
--
if
the
state
tax
10
mills
on
real
property,
that
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
from
the
taxpayers
point
of
view
and
from
the
point
of
view
or
revenue
gathering
but
it
would
be
entirely
unconstitutional
we
submit
for
the
state
to
take
those
funds
and
distribute
it
back
to
the
counties
on
the
basis
of
how
rich
they
are.
and
instead
of
taking
money
and
giving
it
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
could
increase
it
because
they’re
poor,
that’s
a
benign
wealth
classification
which
we
entirely
support,
but
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
--
but
they
couldn’t
decrease
it
because
they’re
poor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
benignly,
that
is
to
favor
the
poor
but
not
to
favor
the
rich.
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
hershel
shanks
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
we’re
making
here
today,
the
answer
is
nothing
would
prohibit
them
although
if
a
case
could
be
made
where
--
i’ve
got
enough
problems
here
without
making
that
case.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no
it
doesn’t
your
honor
for
this
reason.
in
the
case
where
the
state
says
we’re
not
going
to
do
anything,
the
localities
can
do
it,
do
whatever
they
want.
mr.
hershel
shanks
right,
and
the
difficulty
and
this
is
i
think
crucial
to
an
understanding
of
the
case
i’m
trying
to
make.
the
difficulty
that
the
poor
counties
have
and
the
case
you
put
is
that
they
are
too
poor
that
they
can’t
afford,
they
are
unable
to
pay
but
that
isn’t
what
keeps
them
back
here.
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
might
have
the
same
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
might
have
the
same
effect
but
the
source
of
that
effect
would
be
in
the
fact
that
they
are
poor,
the
many
things
--
many
laws
operate
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
if,
a
case
as
i
say
could
be
made
that
even
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
it
is
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
because
it
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
if
the
responsibility
is
the
states,
i’m
arguing
a
case
which
isn’t
mine
today.
i’m
saying
that
it’s
much
worse
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
the
status
of
being
poor
than
it
is
to
pass
a
law
which
operates
equally
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
and
leave
it
up
to
the
localities?
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
equal
and
i
don’t
see
anything
wrong
with
the
constitution.
i
think
it’d
be
very
foolish
and
unwise
but
if
they
authorize
the
localities,
it
can
be
argued
that
they
are
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
an
ability
to
pay
and
the
poor
ones
can’t
afford
it,
but
even
if
that
is
alright
and
i’m
willing
to
assume
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
it
is
alright.
they
can’t
say
for
example
if
they
abolish
all
schools
and
live
it
up
to
the
locality,
they
can’t
say
to
the
rich
locality,
well,
you
can
have
a
school
with
$1,500.00
a
pupil
in
it
and
say
to
the
poor
county,
you’re
poor
and
for
that
reason
we
won’t
let
you
have
a
$1,500.00
school
system,
we’ll
only
let
you
have
a
$500.00
school
system.
and
the
difference
is
that
in
the
second
case
i
put,
the
state
is
forbidding
the
poor
from
doing
the
same
thing
as
the
rich
even
if
the
poor
are
willing
to
sacrifice
to
do
it.
mr.
hershel
shanks
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
true
mr.
justice
brennan
that
in
the
reply
brief
in
this
court,
the
appellants
have
i
think
raised
a
new
justification
for
the
millage
rollback
act.
however,
we
feel
that
we’re
prepared
to
meet
that
here
and
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
stand
--
send
the
case
back.
this
is
essentially
a
statistical
case
and
certain
things
are
necessarily
so.
the
argument
that
they
make
here
for
the
first
time
in
their
reply
brief,
i
think
puts
the
best
light
on
the
millage
rollback
act
that
can
be
put
on
it.
previously,
it
appeared
that
the
millage
rollback
act
had
been
passed
as
a
basis
to
certain
powerful
property
interests
as
a
tradeoff,
so
that
they
would
support
legislation
increasing
state
funding
of
education.
and
our
argument
was
that
a
wealth
discrimination,
a
limitation
that
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
wealth
was
an
unconstitutional
price
to
pay
for
the
increased
state
funding.
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
are
freeholders,
parents
and
students
from
16
counties
who
have
been
adversely
affected
by
the
millage
rollback
act.
mr.
hershel
shanks
prior
to
the
millage
rollback
act,
they
had
voted
to
tax
themselves,
their
properties
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
at
a
higher
rate
than
is
allowed
in
the
millage
rollback
act,
so
that
when
the
--
this
was
a
two-year
authorization.
all
that
was
needed
was
the
vote
of
a
school
board
to
assess
and
levy.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
i
think
that
they
--
on
the
whole,
they’re
from
relatively
poor
counties,
but
i
think
it
extends
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
go
above
the
10-mill
limit.
it
depends
not
only
on
how
poor
they
are,
how
rich
they
are
but
also
on
what
kind
of
an
effort
they
want
to
make.
and
if
they’re
poor,
they
have
to
make
a
greater
effort,
but
sometimes,
some
of
the
middle
range
counties
maybe
willing
to
make
more
of
an
effort
too.
but
these
counties
all
did
tax
themselves
at
a
higher
rate
before
fell
back
as
they
were
required
to
do
by
the
millage
rollback
act
and
in
one
case,
the
school
board
said
it
couldn’t
produce
a
budget
with
the
ten
mills
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
hershel
shanks
personally
i’m
just
not
sure.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
i
don’t
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
i’m
just
not
sure
of
the
locations
of
broward
county.
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes
sir.
mr.
hershel
shanks
but
our
question
--
our
point
is
really
a
relative
one.
a
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
they
are
prevented
as
--
they
are
really
asserting
a
right
of
a
county
in
the
same
way
as
in
gray
v.
sanders,
where
the
disadvantaged
voters
were
asserting
the
right
of
the
county.
these
people
come
from
the
counties
which
have
voted
higher
taxes
and
i
think
it’s
a
fair
assumption
not
on
the
case
of
broward
county
but
in
the
case
of
other
counties
where
they
have
been
collecting
higher
taxes.
and
then
they
fall
back
and
they
don’t
fall
back
to
let’s
say
nine-and-a-half
or
nine,
they
fall
back
right
to
that
limit.
and
i
think
it’s
a
fair
assumption
that
when
you
have
a
higher
tax
rate
that
falls
back
just
to
the
limit,
immediately
after
the
limit
is
opposed
--
imposed
that
this
limitation
is
an
effective
limitation
on
what
they
would
otherwise
be
doing.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
that’s
not
our
argument.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct
and
our
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
our
basic
position
is
that
a
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
i’m
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
precisely
so.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
in
other
words,
they’re
willing
to
--
i
think
if
we
look
at
it
as
tax
authorization
that
the
state
is
actually
giving.
and
if
they
give
the
rich
man
or
the
rich
county
more
than
the
poor
county,
then
that
is
denial
of
equal
protection.
and
our
position
is
that
a
flat
rate
limitation
that
is
ten
mills
does
operate
unequally,
because
in
the
rich
county,
it
authorizes
or
gives
to
the
counties
an
authorization
to
tax
themselves
to
the
extent
of
$750
a
pupil
whereas
in
the
poorer
counties,
it’s
limited
to
$50
a
pupil.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that
raises
a
very
important
point,
your
honor.
there
are
two
elements
of
disparity
which
i
think
conceptually
it’s
important
to
keep
in
mind.
some
of
the
disparity
between
the
--
per
child
in
miami
beach
and
the
child
in
panhandle
result
in
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
child’s
parents
or
the
taxpayers
in
palm
beach
or
miami
beach
can
afford
more.
and
this
case
is
not
raising
squarely
that
issue.
that
issue
is
raised
in
(inaudible)
that
we
discussed
in
our
brief.
but
the
other
kind
of
unequal
treatment
is
where
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no
i
don’t
you
honor
and
i
--
and
we’re
not
contending
in
this
case
but
that’s
what
must
be
done.
we
are
simply
asking
for
the
same
--
we’re
not
even
opposing
a
limitation.
we
are
just
opposing
an
unequal
limitation,
so
that
across
the
board
limitations
--
we
are
quite
--
we
believe
that’s
constitutional.
mr.
hershel
shanks
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hershel
shanks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
this
morning
by
noting
that
there
are
many
aspects
of
the
florida
educational
financing
system
which
are
very
fine
indeed
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
good
we
applaud,
but
there
is
one
element
in
this
system
which
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
wealth
and
to
that
extent
we
attack
it
is
unconstitutional.
basically,
the
florida
system
is
this,
the
state
distributes
to
each
of
the
counties
on
a
very
fair
and
well
considered
basis,
a
major
portion
of
the
funds
to
finance
a
school
system.
now,
i
am
willing
to
assume
here
contrary
to
present
fact
that
this
is
sufficient
to
fund
an
adequate
educational
system.
added
to
this
basic
grant
and
on
top
of
this
is
the
amount
that
the
local
counties
add
through
their
local
tax
effort.
now,
i’m
even
willing
to
assume
here
that
this
added
amount
is
an
educational
frosting.
mr.
hershel
shanks
frosting
on
the
cake
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
in
other
words,
its
something
additional
which
the
--
i
don’t
think
in
fact
of
this
but
i’m
willing
to
assume
that
in
here.
but
we
insist
that
even
the
frosting
be
distributed
on
an
equal
basis
that
is
without
discrimination
based
on
wealth.
the
millage
rollback
act
together
with
the
statutes
which
authorized
florida
counties
to
tax,
create
a
system
where
they
give
to
each
county
a
certain
authority
to
add
this
educational
frosting,
to
raise
these
dollars.
in
some
counties,
it’s
$700.00
a
pupil.
in
other
counties,
it’s
$6.00,
$5.00,
$4.00
and
down
to
$50.00
a
pupil.
each
is
treated
less
well
depending
as
it
goes
down
the
wealth
scale
so
that
it’s
not
a
question
of
only
two
categories,
it’s
a
sliding
scale
and
everybody
but
the
top
county
is
disadvantaged.
now,
we
are
not
opposed
to
limitations
as
such
on
local
effort.
we
don’t
even
insist
on
a
particular
formula
that
the
limitation
should
take.
there
are
variety
of
constitutional
formulas,
for
example,
a
florida
could
in
its
wisdom
say
that
each
county
will
be
limited
to
a
$100.00
a
pupil
or
could
say
each
county
could
be
--
would
be
limited
to
a
$1,000.00
in
instruction
unit
of
the
instruction
unit
as
was
discussed
yesterday
is
a
very
complicated
formula
which
takes
into
account
a
myriad
of
factors,
it
could
take
--
if
there
are
infinite
number
of
reasonable
formulas
for
determining
instruction
units,
to
take
account
of
any
reasonable
difference
in
educational
need,
transportation,
exceptional
children,
guidance
programs,
anything
so
that
we
wouldn’t
object
to
any
limitation
which
applied
without
regard
to
wealth
which
was
reasonably
related
to
the
responsibility
which
each
of
the
local
communities
has
and
if
they
have
the
same
responsibility,
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
must
give
them
the
same
tools
to
meet
that
responsibility.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that
your
honor
would
depend
on
a
number
of
considerations.
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
probably
would
but
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
--
i
can’t
be
sure
--
the
considerations
would
be
this
your
honor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
--
yes,
the
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
a
single
tax
rate
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
probably
would,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
there
would
be
a
number
of
different
factors
but
it
would
be
related
to
the
justice
in
this
case,
it
would
be
related
to
the
wealth
of
the
community
rather
than
the
responsibility
to
the
community,
the
task
that
they
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
would
be
unconstitutional
given
the
--
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
as
it
probably
could
that
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
that
it’s
equal
on
its
face,
it’s
equal
and
that
it
says
that
the
same
number,
flat
tax
rate
is
applicable
but
i
think
the
court
must
ask
the
question,
how
does
this
operate,
does
it
operate
equally
or
unequally.
let
me,
if
i
may
put
a
hypothetical.
instead
of
--
in
this
case
where
we
have
the
state
giving
to
the
local
communities
tax
authorization,
let’s
consider
the
case
where
the
state
was
giving
money
for
educational
purposes
and
suppose
that
the
formula
which
that
they
distributed
money
was
the
same
as
they
distribute
tax
authority
in
this
case.
and
suppose
that
the
state
of
florida
said
that
we
will
give
to
each
county
10
mills,
a
percentage
of
its
tax
base
for
educational
purposes
and
there’s
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
court
would
strike
that
down
nine
to
nothing.
that
has
no
relationship
to
the
educational
task
that
the
counties
are
required
to
undertake.
now,
the
state
of
florida
in
its
presentation
nor
in
its
briefs
has
suggested
a
single
reason
why
an
equal
limitation.
if
an
equal
limitation
--
if
they
want
a
limitation,
why
an
equal
limitation
would
not
serve
all
of
its
purposes?
the
state
suggested
yesterday
that
the
millage
rollback
act
narrows
the
gap
between
the
poor
counties
and
the
rich
counties.
i
think
it
is
obviously
true
that
it
narrows
the
potential
gap
that
is
to
say
that
there’s
a
limit
of
10
mils
on
each
county,
the
potential
gap
is
less
than
if
there’s
a
limitation
of
15
mills
and
a
limitation
of
15
mills
creates
less
of
a
potential
gap
than
no
limitation
at
all
but
the
question
that
we
urge
on
the
court
is
not
the
validity
of
a
limitation,
it’s
the
validity
of
unequal
wealth
related
limitation
expressed
as
a
flat
rate
tax
limitation.
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
am
familiar
with
it
to
the
extent
that
i
have
seen
the
pleadings
and
i
have
talked
to
counsel,
its
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
the
questions
that
are
raised
under
the
state
constitution
mr.
justice
brennan
are
--
that
the
millage
rollback
act
violates
the
provision
of
florida
law
which
says
that
adequate
provision
shall
be
made
by
law
for
a
uniform
system
of
free
public
schools,
another
provisions
which
says
that
all
natural
persons
are
equal
before
the
law
and
have
an
--
rights
and
another
provision
which
i
think
is
even
weaker,
its
rather
complicated,
but
our
position
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that
is
correct
your
honor,
our
position
here
is
that
we
are
suing
under
1983
and
we
have
a
right
to
come
to
a
federal
forum
with
our
federal
claim,
we
have
pressed
only
federal
claims,
i
believe
the
position
that
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
pardon
me?
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
i
believe
that
that
is
the
teaching
in
monroe
v
pape
as
i
read
it
and
the
suggestion
that
a
state
law
issue
or
a
state
constitutional
issue
maybe
a
ground
for
abstention
was
rejected
by
this
court
just
last
month
in
wisconsin
against
constantineau
where
mr.
chief
justice
burger
dissenting
urged
that
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
grounds
your
honor,
i
think
there’s
several
others.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
ambiguity
here
in
the
statute
itself
in
the
millage
rollback
act,
there’s
no
conceivable
vagueness
or
other
way
that
it
could
be
interpreted
that
would
change
the
constitutional
question
here.
moreover,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
that
realistically
speaking,
of
course
it
has
been
tested
but
as
a
lawyer
assessing
a
case,
i
would
say
that
you
would
be
plowing
all
new
ground
under
the
florida
constitution
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
no,
i
say
a
lawyer
would
be,
the
florida
courts
would
be.
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
--
there’s
a
kind
of
guidelines
existing
in
florida
constitutional
law.
mr.
hershel
shanks
raise
--
no,
they
wouldn’t
be
raised
in
the
defense
rather
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
were
not
pressed
by
us.
mr.
hershel
shanks
we
--
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
did
put
in
our
complaint
or
one
of
this
grounds
we
never
referred
to
it
again
though
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
we
never
really,
it
was
quite
candidly,
when
we’re
drafting
a
complaint,
we
try
to
put
everything
conceivable
in.
at
the
--
as
we
press
forward
in
litigation
and
we
assess
our
chances
on
each
--
i
think
we
concluded
that
this
was
not
a
realistically
possibility
of
obtaining
relief
on
this
ground
and
we
are
pressing
only
our
federal
ground
as
we
think
we
have
the
right
to
do
under
monroe
against
pape
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
was
not
before
the
three-judge
court
in
florida
your
honor
is
the
argument
that
this
statute
may
possibly
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
it
narrows
the
gap
and
that
argument
i
think
is
very
easily
met,
the
answer
to
it
is
we
have
no
objection
to
your
trying
to
narrow
the
gap,
all
we
have
objection
to,
is
when
you
do
it
in
an
--
by
imposing
an
unequal
wealth
discrimination.
there’s
an
analogy
i
think
in
this
case
to
1245
against
florida
and
which
mr.
justice
stewart
i
believe
wrote
the
opinion
where
there
was
an
attempt
by
florida,
the
same
state
to
suppress
extramarital
promiscuity
and
the
court
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
excuse
me;
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
in
which
the
court
indicated
there
was
perfectly
proper
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
florida
to
do
something
about
extramarital,
premarital
promiscuity
but
they
said
don’t
do
it
by
drawing
a
racial
line
and
its
--
the
analogy
here
is
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
states
imposing
limitation,
if
that’s
what
they
want
to
do
but
don’t
do
it
by
a
wealth
discriminating
limitation.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
that’s
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
if
they
make
up
the
sums
from
other
sources,
in
other
words,
suppose
a
county
says
aright,
we
would
normally
--
there’s
another
county
here
that’s
raising
a
$150.00
a
pupil
but
the
$10.00
in
our
county,
10
mills
in
our
county
only
raises
a
$100.00
a
pupil
and
if
we
were
free,
if
you
treated
us
equally
with
the
other
county,
we
would
therefore
raise
a
$150.00.
mr.
hershel
shanks
if
the
state
says
we’ll
make
that
$50.00
up
to
you
so
that
you
really
are
being
treated
equally,
that
would
be
alright.
the
only
thing
we
object
to
is
the
unequal
treatment,
we
don’t
know.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct.
well,
that’s
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
respectfully
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it
does
not
because
the
only
thing
that
is
necessary
to
examine
is
the
millage
rollback
act
to
see
whether
it
operates
equally
and
if
it
does
not,
is
there
something
which
equalizes
the
operation
and
the
state
hasn’t
appointed
to
anything
which
equalizes
the
operation.
if
the
state
--
all
the
state
has
said
is
that
well,
we
poured
in
more
money
on
a
fair
basis,
yes
they
have
poured
in
more
money
on
a
fair
basis.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
no,
that
would
be
constitutional.
it’s
not
how
you
get
the
money,
it’s
how
you
give
it
back.
in
other
words,
if
the
state
levy
to
10
mill
or
20
mill
or
30
mill
property
tax
throughout
florida,
there’d
be
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that.
what
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
took
that
money
and
distributed
it
on
the
basis
of
wealth.
and
here,
were
talking
-
there’s
a
big
difference
and
i
think
its
important
to
maintain
the
distinction
between
getting
the
money
in
whether
the
state
is
treating
someone
equally
in
the
way
its
taxing,
from
a
taxpayers
point
of
view
and
on
the
other
hand,
whether
the
state
is
distributing
its
large
or
its
benefits
unequally
here.
and
here,
we
claim
that
the
state
is
distributing
its
benefits
unequally,
not
money
but
in
this
case
authority
to
tax,
and
i
think
it
is
a
discrete
part
of
the
taxing
system
in
florida
and
of
course
it
could
be
met
if
florida
was
to
come
in
here
and
say
yes,
its
true
that
it
does
operate
unequally
but
we
have
made
it
up
by
this.
now,
they
haven’t
come
in
and
said
that
and
that’s
why
i
don’t
think
mr.
justice
white
that
it’s
necessary
to
examine
anymore
of
the
florida
system.
mr.
hershel
shanks
in
that
case
mr.
justice
marshall,
property
maybe
a
measure
of
the
need
for
fire
prevention.
in
other
words,
there
maybe
a
relationship
between
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
don’t
know,
you’re
getting
into
borderline
cases,
but
if
there
is
no
--
in
education
there
is
demonstrably
no
relationship
between
property
and
need.
we
have
shown
in
the
record
here
that
the
--
that
the
tax
base
varies
between
--
between
$5,000.00
a
pupil
and
$72,000.00
a
pupil,
so
that
there’s
no
relationship
whatever.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
correct,
i’d
like
to
go
back
to
something
you
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
not
at
all,
not
at
all
and
i’d
like
to
comment
on
that
if
i
may
because
i
think
it’s
important.
there
are
--
as
your
honor
noted
yesterday,
there
are
variations
in
almost
every
state,
i
think
hawaii
is
the
only
exception
between
the
rich
districts
and
the
poor
districts
and
that
is
because
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
and
we
are
not
urging
equality,
all
we
are
urging
is
a
negative
proposition
that
you
can’t
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
wealth.
there
--
we
don’t
believe
that
a
plaintiff
meets
his
case
simply
by
showing
for
example
that
i’ve
got
a
school
bill
five
years
ago
and
you’ve
got
a
school
bill
just
last
year.
we
say
that
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
is
to
establish
that
there
has
been
a
discrimination
based
--
an
invidious
discrimination
on
race
or
wealth
and
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i’m
obviously
defacing
myself
in
trying
to
explain
it.
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
a
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
what
--
the
state
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
the
equalization
fund
operates
in
this
way.
the
state
gives
--
determines
the
total
amount
of
an
adequate
system
by
a
formula
and
there
is
one
equalization
element
which
my
brother
miner
touched
upon
which
works
this
way.
one
element
of
the
total
picture
is
they
determine
how
much
would
be
raised
by
four
mills
tax
in
the
local
taxing
unit.
and
then
there’s
an
x
figure
up
here
and
they
take
whatever
is
raised
by
four
mills,
the
state
will
makeup
up
to
x.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
right.
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
right.
now,
between
four
and
10,
the
state
--
the
local
district
is
free
to
add
its
own
tax
effort.
mr.
hershel
shanks
up
to
10
and
that
is
where
we
say
that
inevitably
and
necessarily
and
inequity
is
a
discrimination
by
wealth
has
built
in
because
they
say
to
the
one
county,
alright
you
can
tax
an
additional
six
mils
over
the
four
and
whatever
that
is
you
can
add
it
to
your
system
and
whatever
--
given
the
fact
that
there’s
a
wide
variation
in
tax
based
per
pupil,
the
inevitable
result
is
that
in
one
county,
they
can
add
four
or
$500.00
per
pupil
and
the
other
county
is
prevented
from
doing
the
very
same
thing.
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes
your
honor,
there
were
24
counties.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
most
important
table
in
the
case
which
appears
at
the
--
in
the
appendix
at
25
and
26
and
that
is
unfortunately
in
small
type
but
it
has
got
a
lot
of
numbers
in
it
and
shows
that
24
counties
which
prior
to
the
millage
rollback
act
were
taxing
at
up
to
17
and
18
mills.
mr.
hershel
shanks
there
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
there
is
no
line
your
honor,
everybody
below
the
richest
man
is
poor
in
a
relative
sense.
in
other
word,
this
is
a
discrimination
by
wealth.
when
you
--
if
the
state
gives
one
county
authority
to
tax
$700.00
and
another
one
$600.00,
the
one
at
$600.00
--
that’s
getting
$600.00
maybe
what
we
would
normally
call
pretty
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
--well
to
do
country
but
is
still
discriminated
against
compared
to
the
$700.00.
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
i
think
we’d
have
to
examine
each
case
and
maybe
in
some
of
this
case,
something
should
be
done
about
it
your
honor.
i’m
trying
to
make
a
very
narrow
attack
here
on
a
very
clear
discrimination
that
the
statute
imposes
that
doesn’t
result
from
the
fact
that
they
are
poor
and
can’t
afford
it,
they’re
willing
to
tax
themselves
at
a
higher
rate,
they’re
willing
to
raise
more
money
for
their
children
but
this
statute
prevents
them
from
doing
so.
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
cannot
do
what
some
of
the
taxpayers
in
wealthier
counties
can
do.
mr.
hershel
shanks
we
know
that
they’re
denied
the
same
rights
as
the
taxpayers
in
a
neighboring
wealthier
county.
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
were
not
before
because
they
--
could
not
before
--
be
before
them
at
the
time
because
they
occurred
afterward,
and
all
they
represent
your
honor
is
the
additions
that
the
state
has
distributed
to
the
counties
on
a
fair
basis
and
we
don’t
contest
that,
we
acknowledge
that
the
state
has
distributed
to
the
monofair
basis
and
increase
the
funds.
the
only
thing
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
only
thing
that
we
attack
is
that
narrow
area
above
the
basic
state
grant
which
is
a
grant
of
authority
to
the
counties
to
help
themselves
and
we
say
that
grant
of
authority
is
unequal
one
because
it’s
based
on
how
rich
you
are.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no,
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
you
did,
i’m
sorry
to
have
given
that
impression
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
the
state
could
tax
at
10
mills,
that
part
is
alright,
the
taxing
part,
but
it
couldn’t
take
that
money
and
distribute
it
on
the
basis
of
how
rich
the
counties
were.
it
doesn’t
distribute,
for
example,
it
takes
the
sales
and
used
tax
where
it
gets
most
of
the
money
to
support
the
public
schools.
it
takes
that
sales
and
used
tax
but
it
doesn’t
give
it
back
to
the
counties
on
the
basis
of
where
the
money
came
from,
it
has
a
formula
which
is
related
to
the
educational
needs
of
the
varying
counties,
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
50%
of
it
came
from
dade
county.
dade
county
doesn’t
get
50%,
it
gets
it
in
terms
of
a
formula
related
to
need
and
if
they
tax
--
if
the
state
tax
10
mills
on
real
property,
that
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
from
the
taxpayers
point
of
view
and
from
the
point
of
view
or
revenue
gathering
but
it
would
be
entirely
unconstitutional
we
submit
for
the
state
to
take
those
funds
and
distribute
it
back
to
the
counties
on
the
basis
of
how
rich
they
are.
and
instead
of
taking
money
and
giving
it
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
they
could
increase
it
because
they’re
poor,
that’s
a
benign
wealth
classification
which
we
entirely
support,
but
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
--
but
they
couldn’t
decrease
it
because
they’re
poor.
mr.
hershel
shanks
benignly,
that
is
to
favor
the
poor
but
not
to
favor
the
rich.
mr.
hershel
shanks
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
hershel
shanks
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
we’re
making
here
today,
the
answer
is
nothing
would
prohibit
them
although
if
a
case
could
be
made
where
--
i’ve
got
enough
problems
here
without
making
that
case.
mr.
hershel
shanks
no
it
doesn’t
your
honor
for
this
reason.
in
the
case
where
the
state
says
we’re
not
going
to
do
anything,
the
localities
can
do
it,
do
whatever
they
want.
mr.
hershel
shanks
right,
and
the
difficulty
and
this
is
i
think
crucial
to
an
understanding
of
the
case
i’m
trying
to
make.
the
difficulty
that
the
poor
counties
have
and
the
case
you
put
is
that
they
are
too
poor
that
they
can’t
afford,
they
are
unable
to
pay
but
that
isn’t
what
keeps
them
back
here.
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
might
have
the
same
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
it
might
have
the
same
effect
but
the
source
of
that
effect
would
be
in
the
fact
that
they
are
poor,
the
many
things
--
many
laws
operate
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
if,
a
case
as
i
say
could
be
made
that
even
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
it
is
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
because
it
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
if
the
responsibility
is
the
states,
i’m
arguing
a
case
which
isn’t
mine
today.
i’m
saying
that
it’s
much
worse
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
the
status
of
being
poor
than
it
is
to
pass
a
law
which
operates
equally
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
and
leave
it
up
to
the
localities?
mr.
hershel
shanks
well,
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
hershel
shanks
that’s
equal
and
i
don’t
see
anything
wrong
with
the
constitution.
i
think
it’d
be
very
foolish
and
unwise
but
if
they
authorize
the
localities,
it
can
be
argued
that
they
are
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
an
ability
to
pay
and
the
poor
ones
can’t
afford
it,
but
even
if
that
is
alright
and
i’m
willing
to
assume
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
it
is
alright.
they
can’t
say
for
example
if
they
abolish
all
schools
and
live
it
up
to
the
locality,
they
can’t
say
to
the
rich
locality,
well,
you
can
have
a
school
with
$1,500.00
a
pupil
in
it
and
say
to
the
poor
county,
you’re
poor
and
for
that
reason
we
won’t
let
you
have
a
$1,500.00
school
system,
we’ll
only
let
you
have
a
$500.00
school
system.
and
the
difference
is
that
in
the
second
case
i
put,
the
state
is
forbidding
the
poor
from
doing
the
same
thing
as
the
rich
even
if
the
poor
are
willing
to
sacrifice
to
do
it.
mr.
hershel
shanks
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
