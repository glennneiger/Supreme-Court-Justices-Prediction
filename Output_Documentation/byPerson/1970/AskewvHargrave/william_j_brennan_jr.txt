the
expenditures
and
included
from,
to
some
extent,
property
tax
to
other
source
of
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
might
as
far
be
two
years
to
1974
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
raised
that
much
from
property
taxes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have
the
kind
of
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
are
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
part
of
same
preference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
with
the
instructional
unit,
is
that
a
statewide
conference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
authorize
that
at
some
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
amount
required
in
order
to
provide
statewide
education
of
the
same
quality
throughout
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
20%
in
some
places?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
100
or
150
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
counsel,
i
think
--
would
this
be
mean
by
and
large,
education
primarily,
state
operation
on
the
county
or
throughout?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
that
you
have
to
make
this
limitation
in
order
to
let
people
--
get
counties
to
give
up
their
autonomy
in
the
education,
i
mean
with
political
decisions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
(inaudible)
which
is
also
an
equalization
to
set
mill
and
on
a
thousand
dollars
for
the
county
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
realize
the
same
amount
of
seven
mills
on
a
thousand
dollars.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
if
they
do,
they
don’t
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
think
this
one
offers
the
summary
judgment
to
florida.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
told
us
mr.
miner
that
none
of
the
things
you
were
arguing
today
in
this
materially
brief
apparently
submitted
to
the
district
court,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i’m
just
wondering
if
it
is
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right,
this
was
not
submitted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
exactly
is
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
already
have
the
record,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
might
be,
is
this
question
in
the
light
that
you
put
of
course
that
we
are
trying
to
decide
here
or
rather
are
just
sentenced
back
that
the
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
they
can,
why
should
we
direct
that,
this
ought
--
if
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate,
this
ought
to
go
back
to
be
redone
by
the
district
court,
shouldn’t
that
include
in
the
question
of
abstention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
different
parties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
0747
can
the
act
of
the
state
court
on
the
subject
of
other
plaintiff,
are
you
familiar
with
the
accusation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
the
issues
that
are
raised
in
the
state
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
well,
i
gather
if
those
contention
would
prevail
under
the
state
law
would
be
necessary
to
us
or
any
court
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
of
1983
i
assume?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
facts
that
its
1983
would
not
conclude
with
it
an
appropriate
phase
essentially
until
the
state
law
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
1983
action,
new
submission
include
the
statute,
do
you
haev
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however,
any
ambiguity
may
nevertheless
may
not
be
unconstitutional
under
the
state
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

we
would?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

are
there
any
state

grounds
raised
in
defense
litigation?
justice
william
j.

were

were
