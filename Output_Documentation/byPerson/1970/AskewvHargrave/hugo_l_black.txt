may
i
suggest
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
confess
this
case
is
rather
mysterious
to
me
after
all
the
argument,
i
do
not
fully
understand
what
these
issues
mean
to
somebody,
in
someway.
i
suppose
the
state
had
decided
to
abandon
a
state
school
system
and
leave
it
up
to
each
county
to
have
the
system
that
they
wanted
to
pay
for,
could
they
do
that?
what
--
would
there
be
in
the
constitution
to
prohibit
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i’m
just
trying
to
find
out,
it
seems
to
me
like
it
has
a
pretty
close
relationship
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
original
way
of
running
the
schools
in
this
country
wasn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
it
have
the
same
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
left
it
up
to
the
county
to
pay
taxes
education
on
children
wouldn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
the
source
would
be
that
the
state
decided,
let
the
county
run
their
own
school,
elect
their
own
taxes
in
their
own
way,
suppose
it
did
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
what
would
it
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
depends
on
who
has
the
right
to
run
--
basic
right
to
run
the
public
schools.
justice
hugo
l.

suppose
the
state
decided
and
wanted
to
abolish
all
the
schools.
justice

no,
