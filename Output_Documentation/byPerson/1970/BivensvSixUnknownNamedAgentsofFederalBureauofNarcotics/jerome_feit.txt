mr.
jerome
feit
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
clear
what
in
the
government's
view
is
and
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
under
section
1331
(a)
in
the
sense
of
bell
v.
hood
for
a
cause
of
action
as
stated
on
one
construction
of
the
constitution
and
defeated
on
another.
the
critical
question
here
and
the
one
left
undecided
in
bell
and
hood
by
this
court,
is
recognizing
that
the
complaint
on
its
face
for
pleading
purposes
states
an
actionable
tort
under
state
law.
should
it
also
be
read
as
giving
rise
to
a
constitutional
tort,
so
that
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
type
of
injuries
compensable
and
the
kinds
of
damages
recoverable
should
be
governed
by
federally
created
law.
our
answer
is
no,
basically,
because
of
lack
of
necessity.
indeed
the
tort
remedy
as
i
would
suggest
a
little
later
in
the
argument
is
basically
ineffectual
as
most
of
the
commentators
have
suggested.
mr.
jerome
feit
what
happens
--
well,
what
happens
to
practical
matter
mr.
justice
is
that
if
this
suit
have
been
brought
in
state
court,
it
would
have
been
removed
by
the
federal
government
to
the
federal
court
under
1442
(a)
of
the
removal
statute
because
the
federal
defenses
under
these
--
mr.
jerome
feit
the
governing
law
with
regard
to
the
issues
of
justification
for
the
officer's
action
in
arresting
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
--
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
law
with
regards
to
perhaps
defenses
of
immunity
would
be
governed
by
federal
law,
but
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
itself
as
i
had
indicated,
the
type
of
injuries
compensable,
the
kind
of
damages
recoverable
would
not
be
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
unless
this
court
creates
a
constitutional
tort
because
historically
--
mr.
jerome
feit
state
court
could
say
assuming
as
i've
said
that
it's
not
being
removed
to
the
federal
court
as
it
always
will
be
against
a
federal
officer
under
1442
(a),
the
state
court
could
under
settled
precedent
say,
looking
to
the
officer's
action,
we
will
determine
this
as
it
has
to
under
federal
law.
but
i
have
great
difficulty
unless
this
court
decides
that
the
arising
under
jurisdiction
of
1331
(a)
creates
a
federal
cause
of
action
that
the
state
court
could
look
to
federal
law
with
regard
to
the
injuries
and
the
damages
compensable.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
i
didn't
--
i
meant
to
say,
if
i
did
say
that
excuse
mr.
justice.
as
i've
said
that
the
case
will
always
be
removed
to
the
federal
court
as
it
has
been
in
the
past
under
1442
(a).
mr.
jerome
feit
right.
mr.
jerome
feit
and
what
would
happen,
that's
correct.
it
will
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
this
was
never
commenced
in
the
state
court,
so
that
the
issue
is
not
what
would
be
gained.
i
think
that
to
our
point
of
view,
what
would
happen
would
be
that
the
court
would
be
creating
a
constitutional
tort
and
petitioners
talked
about
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
i'd
like
to
indicate
the
government's
view
is
entirely
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jerome
feit
in
terms
of
--
you
mean,
in
terms
of
the
government's
favor,
your
honor?
well,
in
terms
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
--
this
alleged
invasion
of
privacy
occurred
in
november
26,
1965.
the
lawsuit
was
not
commenced
until
june
of
1967,
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
events.
if
they
haven't
been
broad
in
state
court
against
the
state
office,
there
was
a
one
year
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
and
even
if
this
court
decides
to
create
a
cause
of
action
and
we,
of
course
suggest
that
do
not
--
does
not
reach
barr
and
matteo
at
all,
and
if
it
goes
back
to
the
federal
court,
for
example,
and
you
say
there
is
such
cause
of
action,
presumably,
it
would
be
dismissed
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
government
can
allege
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
jerome
feit
there
–
and
i
think
this
fits
in
with
our
general
proposition.
historically,
there
has
been
recognition
of
a
cause
of
action
and
injunctive
relief
primarily
against
situations,
against
the
enforcement
of
state
statutes
allegedly
unconstitutional
state
statutes.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
would
assume
that
there
could
be
a
situation
where
they
would
be.
mr.
jerome
feit
it
would
be
arising
under
the
constitution
in
terms
of
the
injunctive
remedy.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
the
government
--
mr.
jerome
feit
because,
we
think
that
the
two
are
somewhat
different.
for
example
---
mr.
jerome
feit
that
is
–
that
the
cause
--
that
the
injunction,
the
action
for
injunctive
relief
which
is
essentially
an
action
which
rests
on
necessity.
for
example,
as
to
a
federal
officer,
the
law
is
not
clear
and
i
think
it
looks
the
other
way,
the
state
cannot
enjoin
the
federal
law
officer,
at
least
professor
warren
thinks
that,
and
you've
suggested
that
in
wheeler
and
wheeldin.
so,
there
is
no
remedy
with
regard
in
a
state
court
with
regard
to
a
federal
officer
in
terms
of
injunctive
relief.
in
that
sense,
it
fits
our
general
preposition.
in
other
words,
this
court
recognizes
that
a
remedy
should
exist
in
the
federal
courts,
if
there's
no
remedy
existing
in
state
courts
and
the
injunction
proceeding
fits
the
need
of
necessity.
it
would
be
monstrous
i
submit,
that
there
should
a
right
without
a
remedy.
clearly
here,
there
is
a
remedy
in
damages
in
state
court.
it
seems
to
me
its
petitioner's
burden
to
show
there
was
necessity
to
create
a
damage
action.
it
is
our
position
and
the
position
of
those
who
have
--
the
commentators
who
have
dealt
with
this
matter
in
complete
detail
that
the
difficulties
with
regard
to
the
damage
action
do
not
lie
in
the
vagaries
of
state
law
as
is
alleged
here
by
petitioner.
essentially,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
hesitancy
of
those
who
have
been
arrested
to
sue
the
police
and
if
they
do
sue
the
undeniable
fact
that
juries
are
reluctant
to
hold
federal
or
a
state
officers
personally
responsible
in
damages
at
the
request
of
one
who
may
have
a
criminal
record
or
comes
from
the
lowest
economic
levels
of
society.
it
seems
to
us
as
the
writers
have
pointed
out
that
other
remedy
should
be
sought
perhaps
against
the
police
entity
in
terms
of
governmental
liability,
amending
the
tort
claims
act
perhaps.
should
administrative
boards
independent
to
the
police
be
established
to
monitor
the
police
behavior
and
if
such
bodies
are
created
what
are
their
duties
to
be
and
these
are
kinds
of
questions
that
seems
to
me
that
are
best
suited
for
legislative
determination
and
study
in
judgment.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes
and
of
course,
i
think
that
tends
to
support
our
position
that
is
congress
in
1983
as
this
court
read
it
in
monroe
and
pape
created
by
statute
a
civil
remedy
against
state
officers.
mr.
jerome
feit
and
acting
under
the
color
of
state
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
under
the
1983
you
look
to
the
federal
--
you
look
to
whatever
federal
common
law
applies
and
you
can
look
to
state
law
certainly.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
this
is
a
not
a
real
meaningful
distinction
because
all
of
these
cases
against
federal
offices
brought
in
the
state
courts
will
be
removed
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
law
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
damages
and
regard
to
the
injuries,
the
type
of
injuries
compensable.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
officer
acted
on
probable
cause
whether
the
--
he
had
immunity
from
suit.
these
questions
quite
clearly
will
be
governed
by
federal
law.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
--
to
the
court
is
that
the
notion
that
the
vagaries
of
state
law,
the
difference
in
state
law,
are
the
reasons
why
the
tort
remedy
has
been
ineffectual
are
not
really
accurate.
the
reason
is
as
i've
said
is
that
wherever
the
case
is
tried
juries
generally
do
not
like
to
impose
liability
on
police
officers.
and
no
one
--
none
of
the
commentators
even
professor
foote
who
is
cited
so
extensively
by
petitioner
in
his
brief
suggests
governmental
responsibility,
deduction
of
governmental
responsibility,
perhaps
liquidated
damages
other
writers
talked
as
i
have
said
about
the
setting
up
of
watch
dog
committees.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
case
is
removed
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
say
that,
as
to
the
--
essentially
as
to
the
defense
as
federal
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
i
understand
it
what
would
be
left
for
state
law
would
be
the
measure
of
damages.
mr.
jerome
feit
what
the
type
of
damages
that
can
be
recoverable.
mr.
jerome
feit
punitive,
punitive
compensatory
damages.
i
might
point
out,
for
example,
that
new
york
state
where
this
action
was
--
where
this
occurred
is
a
leader
in
allowing
responsibility
for
damages
for
mental
suffering.
that
kind
of
thing
which
would
--
we
submit
would
be
governed
by
state
law.
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
question
of
justification,
that
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
was
engaged,
that
would
be
governed
by
federal
law
whether
there
was
immunity
from
suit
that
would
be
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
it's
not
to
protect
the
federal
courts
in
that
sense.
i
think
that
essentially
what
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
first
as
a
jurisprudential
kind
of
thing
is
to
whether
or
not
this
court
--
as
it
is
not
done
in
over
200
years
of
litigation
in
these
areas
to
determine
that
a
cause
of
action
exists
under
the
constitution
without
the
showing
any
necessity.
it
seems
to
us,
for
example,
that
if
this
court
says
that
the
cause
of
action
is
governed
by
federal
law,
maybe
creating
a
constitutional
tort.
could
congress
then
--
could
congress
then
decide
well
we
do
not
think
that
the
tort
remedy
is
effective?
would
congress
be
barred
from
saying,
we
do
not
think
the
tort
remedy
is
an
effective
method,
we
want
to
try
something
else,
assuming
that
the
federal
law
enforcement
officer
is
the
type
which
requires
some
other
kind
of
treatment?
would
you
need
a
constitutional
amendment
for
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
you
raise
quite
difficult
problems
even
if
it
doesn't
raise
constitutional
questions.
would
congress
be
chilled
in
further
examination
and
decide
well,
we
will
leave
this
matter
to
the
courts
for
determination?
mr.
jerome
feit
i
would
have
great
doubt
about
that.
i've
--
this
court
has
not
decided
whether
--
mr.
jerome
feit
no.
well,
i
think
what
i
am
suggesting
is
--
mr.
jerome
feit
it's
a
replevin
action,
isn't
it?
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
i
know
but
a
replevin
action
rests
on
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
would
the
federal
law
govern
it
or
not?
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
why
wouldn't
it?
mr.
jerome
feit
excuse
me
that
why
state
law
would
not
be
applicable?
mr.
jerome
feit
i
thought
that
my
position
is
that
state
law
would
be
applicable
because
the
cause
of
action
as
a
common
law
basis,
did
not
arise
from
the
constitution
in
the
fourth
amendment.
the
constitution
essentially
is
that
historical
basis,
i
think
clearly
shows,
was
aimed
at
securing
that
right
and
creating
of
the
rule
that
you
could
not
rely
upon
writs
of
assistance
and
the
general
warrants
for
justification.
mr.
jerome
feit
assuming
a
cause
of
action
for
trespass,
false
imprisonment,
of
that
nature
against
a
federal
officer.
mr.
jerome
feit
possibly
replevin
--
mr.
jerome
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
--
mr.
jerome
feit
as
i
say
it
may
--
mr.
jerome
feit
correct.
mr.
jerome
feit
that's
removed
to
the
federal
court
--
mr.
jerome
feit
he
is
a
federal
officer.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
you
have
then
in
a
sense
in
which
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
other
second
point
again,
the
thing
you
have
just
then
it
seems
to
us
is
the
creation
of
a
constitutional
cause
of
action.
mr.
jerome
feit
because
if
you
do
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
defects
in
creating
that
kind
of
remedy,
even
if
it
isn't
a
constitutional
tort
in
that
sense
could
congress
then
change
it
as
against
federal
officers.
mr.
jerome
feit
and
secondly,
for
example,
if
you
recognize
the
existence
of
this
federal
cause
of
action,
might
it
not
be
or
have
an
over
deterring
effect
on
federal
officers.
again,
its
against
wheeler
and
wheeldin
which
was
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago,
where
this
court
refused
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
from
a
statute
dealing
with
the
granting
of
process
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
that
we're
not
in
the
free
wheeling
days
of
erie
against
tompkins.
essentially
our
position
are
on
the
cause
of
action
issue
is
that
we're
concerned
as
to
what
may
be
the
consequences
of
that
creation,
of
that
kind
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
suing
individual
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
possibilities
that
congress
may
not
act.
it's
a
kind
of
an
area
where
what
are
the
burden
--
what
are
the
natures
of
the
remedies
that
should
be
afforded
are
quite
difficult
to
determine.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
counsel's
judicial
restraint
and
--
requires
legislative
or
perhaps
congressional
action
in
the
area.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
remedy
asked
for
here
was
$15,000.00
against
each
federal
officer.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
it
does
not.
that's
fairly
clear
on.
i've
tried
to
indicate
the
reasons
why
we
feel,
however,
that
the
court
should
not
create
the
cause
of
action
for
reasons
of
as
we
have
tried
--
as
i've
tried
to
say,
for
fear
that
it
might
create
a
constitutional
tort,
limit
the
congress.
but
if
the
court
should
reject
our
view,
if
i
may
use
my
remaining
time
on
my
remaining
issue,
and
should
reject
our
view
and
determine
at
the
cause
of
action
for
damages
should
be
created
on
the
fourth
--
under
the
fourth
amendment,
so
that
this
was
properly
brought
in
the
federal
courts.
we
strongly
urge
that
it
should
not
now
decide
the
question
of
official
immunity
pressed
upon
it
by
petitioner.
what
petitioner
says
so
and
the
record
can
read
both
ways.
it's
not
clear
that
the
district
court
reached
that
issue.
but
even
if
it
did,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did
not.
it
clearly
refrained
from
reaching
the
question
of
immunity.
the
only
facts
in
the
record
consists
of
petitioner's
brief
complaint,
his
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
and
its
accompanying
affidavit.
without
a
hearing,
the
district
court
dismissed
in
a
short
memorandum
on
the
ground
that
it
have
no
jurisdiction
and
it
subsequent
memorandum
denying
the
motion
to
appeal
at
in
forma
pauperis,
found
additionally
that
no
cause
of
action
had
been
stated.
the
record
i
think
is,
in
our
judgment,
is
wholly
inadequate
to
permit
an
informed
judgment
as
to
whether
the
agents
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
duties.
it
may
well
be
on
the
development
of
the
facts
that
the
agents
were
indeed
acting
with
probable
cause.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
plaintiff
complaint
if
one
reads
the
record
at
page
one
and
two
for
example
that's
set
forth
in
monroe
v.
pape
where
13
chicago
police
officers
entered
early
hours
in
the
morning
and
forced
mr.
monroe
and
his
family
to
stand
naked,
then
took
mr.
monroe
down
to
headquarters
for
intensive
investigation.
as
i
say
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
officers'
actions
maybe
explainable
as
completely
justified
under
the
fourth
amendment.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
maybe
able
to
assert
that
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
was
wholly
technical.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
should
--
mr.
jerome
feit
the
government
moved
to
dismissed
the
complaint.
and
moved
--
mr.
jerome
feit
and
file
an
affidavit
relying
on
part
on
the
claim
that
the
action
was
brought
under
the
civil
rights
statute.
mr.
jerome
feit
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
the
government
may
have
made
a
mistake
or
that
the
court
did
not
require,
the
district
court
did
not
require
further
governmental
affidavits
of
further
showing.
it
seems
to
us
the
government
--
that
this
court
should
--
that
this
court
should
not
be
required
to
decide
a
question
of
such
significance
as
the
barr
and
matteo
proposition
on
this
kind
of
barren
record.
thus,
if
--
it
seems
to
us
under
the
procedures
for
relief
based
upon
the
new
federal
rules
of
procedure,
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
further
affidavit
should
be
submitted
to
permit
the
record
to
be
flushed
out.
and
this
court
should
not
reach
on
this
very
barren
context,
this
very
significant
question
as
to
the
scope
of
the
immunity
doctrine
as
applied
to
federal
agents.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
the
suggestion
was
not
made
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
courts
of
appeals
specifically
however,
refrained.
the
government
argued
barr
and
matteo
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
specifically
refrained
from
deciding
that
question
finding
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
available,
pleading
that
it
should
not
create
one
because
of
the
rule
of
exclusion
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
the
creation
of
such
remedy.
for
these
reasons,
it
is
our
basic
position
that
the
court
should
not
create
a
constitutional
tort
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
and
if
it
disagrees
with
us
on
this
issue,
however,
we
strongly
urge
that
it
not
reach
the
immunity
issue,
since
no
record
exists
upon
which
that
issue
can
fairly
be
decided.
it
should
instead
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
further
development
of
the
record
on
that
issue
and
on
other
possible
issues
of
justification
for
the
official
action.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
feit
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
make
clear
what
in
the
government's
view
is
and
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
under
section
1331
(a)
in
the
sense
of
bell
v.
hood
for
a
cause
of
action
as
stated
on
one
construction
of
the
constitution
and
defeated
on
another.
the
critical
question
here
and
the
one
left
undecided
in
bell
and
hood
by
this
court,
is
recognizing
that
the
complaint
on
its
face
for
pleading
purposes
states
an
actionable
tort
under
state
law.
should
it
also
be
read
as
giving
rise
to
a
constitutional
tort,
so
that
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
type
of
injuries
compensable
and
the
kinds
of
damages
recoverable
should
be
governed
by
federally
created
law.
our
answer
is
no,
basically,
because
of
lack
of
necessity.
indeed
the
tort
remedy
as
i
would
suggest
a
little
later
in
the
argument
is
basically
ineffectual
as
most
of
the
commentators
have
suggested.
mr.
jerome
feit
what
happens
--
well,
what
happens
to
practical
matter
mr.
justice
is
that
if
this
suit
have
been
brought
in
state
court,
it
would
have
been
removed
by
the
federal
government
to
the
federal
court
under
1442
(a)
of
the
removal
statute
because
the
federal
defenses
under
these
--
mr.
jerome
feit
the
governing
law
with
regard
to
the
issues
of
justification
for
the
officer's
action
in
arresting
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
--
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
law
with
regards
to
perhaps
defenses
of
immunity
would
be
governed
by
federal
law,
but
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
itself
as
i
had
indicated,
the
type
of
injuries
compensable,
the
kind
of
damages
recoverable
would
not
be
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
unless
this
court
creates
a
constitutional
tort
because
historically
--
mr.
jerome
feit
state
court
could
say
assuming
as
i've
said
that
it's
not
being
removed
to
the
federal
court
as
it
always
will
be
against
a
federal
officer
under
1442
(a),
the
state
court
could
under
settled
precedent
say,
looking
to
the
officer's
action,
we
will
determine
this
as
it
has
to
under
federal
law.
but
i
have
great
difficulty
unless
this
court
decides
that
the
arising
under
jurisdiction
of
1331
(a)
creates
a
federal
cause
of
action
that
the
state
court
could
look
to
federal
law
with
regard
to
the
injuries
and
the
damages
compensable.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
i
didn't
--
i
meant
to
say,
if
i
did
say
that
excuse
mr.
justice.
as
i've
said
that
the
case
will
always
be
removed
to
the
federal
court
as
it
has
been
in
the
past
under
1442
(a).
mr.
jerome
feit
right.
mr.
jerome
feit
and
what
would
happen,
that's
correct.
it
will
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
this
was
never
commenced
in
the
state
court,
so
that
the
issue
is
not
what
would
be
gained.
i
think
that
to
our
point
of
view,
what
would
happen
would
be
that
the
court
would
be
creating
a
constitutional
tort
and
petitioners
talked
about
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
i'd
like
to
indicate
the
government's
view
is
entirely
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jerome
feit
in
terms
of
--
you
mean,
in
terms
of
the
government's
favor,
your
honor?
well,
in
terms
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
--
this
alleged
invasion
of
privacy
occurred
in
november
26,
1965.
the
lawsuit
was
not
commenced
until
june
of
1967,
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
events.
if
they
haven't
been
broad
in
state
court
against
the
state
office,
there
was
a
one
year
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
and
even
if
this
court
decides
to
create
a
cause
of
action
and
we,
of
course
suggest
that
do
not
--
does
not
reach
barr
and
matteo
at
all,
and
if
it
goes
back
to
the
federal
court,
for
example,
and
you
say
there
is
such
cause
of
action,
presumably,
it
would
be
dismissed
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
government
can
allege
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
jerome
feit
there
–
and
i
think
this
fits
in
with
our
general
proposition.
historically,
there
has
been
recognition
of
a
cause
of
action
and
injunctive
relief
primarily
against
situations,
against
the
enforcement
of
state
statutes
allegedly
unconstitutional
state
statutes.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
would
assume
that
there
could
be
a
situation
where
they
would
be.
mr.
jerome
feit
it
would
be
arising
under
the
constitution
in
terms
of
the
injunctive
remedy.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
the
government
--
mr.
jerome
feit
because,
we
think
that
the
two
are
somewhat
different.
for
example
---
mr.
jerome
feit
that
is
–
that
the
cause
--
that
the
injunction,
the
action
for
injunctive
relief
which
is
essentially
an
action
which
rests
on
necessity.
for
example,
as
to
a
federal
officer,
the
law
is
not
clear
and
i
think
it
looks
the
other
way,
the
state
cannot
enjoin
the
federal
law
officer,
at
least
professor
warren
thinks
that,
and
you've
suggested
that
in
wheeler
and
wheeldin.
so,
there
is
no
remedy
with
regard
in
a
state
court
with
regard
to
a
federal
officer
in
terms
of
injunctive
relief.
in
that
sense,
it
fits
our
general
preposition.
in
other
words,
this
court
recognizes
that
a
remedy
should
exist
in
the
federal
courts,
if
there's
no
remedy
existing
in
state
courts
and
the
injunction
proceeding
fits
the
need
of
necessity.
it
would
be
monstrous
i
submit,
that
there
should
a
right
without
a
remedy.
clearly
here,
there
is
a
remedy
in
damages
in
state
court.
it
seems
to
me
its
petitioner's
burden
to
show
there
was
necessity
to
create
a
damage
action.
it
is
our
position
and
the
position
of
those
who
have
--
the
commentators
who
have
dealt
with
this
matter
in
complete
detail
that
the
difficulties
with
regard
to
the
damage
action
do
not
lie
in
the
vagaries
of
state
law
as
is
alleged
here
by
petitioner.
essentially,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
hesitancy
of
those
who
have
been
arrested
to
sue
the
police
and
if
they
do
sue
the
undeniable
fact
that
juries
are
reluctant
to
hold
federal
or
a
state
officers
personally
responsible
in
damages
at
the
request
of
one
who
may
have
a
criminal
record
or
comes
from
the
lowest
economic
levels
of
society.
it
seems
to
us
as
the
writers
have
pointed
out
that
other
remedy
should
be
sought
perhaps
against
the
police
entity
in
terms
of
governmental
liability,
amending
the
tort
claims
act
perhaps.
should
administrative
boards
independent
to
the
police
be
established
to
monitor
the
police
behavior
and
if
such
bodies
are
created
what
are
their
duties
to
be
and
these
are
kinds
of
questions
that
seems
to
me
that
are
best
suited
for
legislative
determination
and
study
in
judgment.
mr.
jerome
feit
yes
and
of
course,
i
think
that
tends
to
support
our
position
that
is
congress
in
1983
as
this
court
read
it
in
monroe
and
pape
created
by
statute
a
civil
remedy
against
state
officers.
mr.
jerome
feit
and
acting
under
the
color
of
state
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
under
the
1983
you
look
to
the
federal
--
you
look
to
whatever
federal
common
law
applies
and
you
can
look
to
state
law
certainly.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
this
is
a
not
a
real
meaningful
distinction
because
all
of
these
cases
against
federal
offices
brought
in
the
state
courts
will
be
removed
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
law
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
damages
and
regard
to
the
injuries,
the
type
of
injuries
compensable.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
officer
acted
on
probable
cause
whether
the
--
he
had
immunity
from
suit.
these
questions
quite
clearly
will
be
governed
by
federal
law.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
--
to
the
court
is
that
the
notion
that
the
vagaries
of
state
law,
the
difference
in
state
law,
are
the
reasons
why
the
tort
remedy
has
been
ineffectual
are
not
really
accurate.
the
reason
is
as
i've
said
is
that
wherever
the
case
is
tried
juries
generally
do
not
like
to
impose
liability
on
police
officers.
and
no
one
--
none
of
the
commentators
even
professor
foote
who
is
cited
so
extensively
by
petitioner
in
his
brief
suggests
governmental
responsibility,
deduction
of
governmental
responsibility,
perhaps
liquidated
damages
other
writers
talked
as
i
have
said
about
the
setting
up
of
watch
dog
committees.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
case
is
removed
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
say
that,
as
to
the
--
essentially
as
to
the
defense
as
federal
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
as
i
understand
it
what
would
be
left
for
state
law
would
be
the
measure
of
damages.
mr.
jerome
feit
what
the
type
of
damages
that
can
be
recoverable.
mr.
jerome
feit
punitive,
punitive
compensatory
damages.
i
might
point
out,
for
example,
that
new
york
state
where
this
action
was
--
where
this
occurred
is
a
leader
in
allowing
responsibility
for
damages
for
mental
suffering.
that
kind
of
thing
which
would
--
we
submit
would
be
governed
by
state
law.
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
question
of
justification,
that
is
the
kind
of
conduct
that
was
engaged,
that
would
be
governed
by
federal
law
whether
there
was
immunity
from
suit
that
would
be
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
it's
not
to
protect
the
federal
courts
in
that
sense.
i
think
that
essentially
what
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
first
as
a
jurisprudential
kind
of
thing
is
to
whether
or
not
this
court
--
as
it
is
not
done
in
over
200
years
of
litigation
in
these
areas
to
determine
that
a
cause
of
action
exists
under
the
constitution
without
the
showing
any
necessity.
it
seems
to
us,
for
example,
that
if
this
court
says
that
the
cause
of
action
is
governed
by
federal
law,
maybe
creating
a
constitutional
tort.
could
congress
then
--
could
congress
then
decide
well
we
do
not
think
that
the
tort
remedy
is
effective?
would
congress
be
barred
from
saying,
we
do
not
think
the
tort
remedy
is
an
effective
method,
we
want
to
try
something
else,
assuming
that
the
federal
law
enforcement
officer
is
the
type
which
requires
some
other
kind
of
treatment?
would
you
need
a
constitutional
amendment
for
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
you
raise
quite
difficult
problems
even
if
it
doesn't
raise
constitutional
questions.
would
congress
be
chilled
in
further
examination
and
decide
well,
we
will
leave
this
matter
to
the
courts
for
determination?
mr.
jerome
feit
i
would
have
great
doubt
about
that.
i've
--
this
court
has
not
decided
whether
--
mr.
jerome
feit
no.
well,
i
think
what
i
am
suggesting
is
--
mr.
jerome
feit
it's
a
replevin
action,
isn't
it?
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
i
know
but
a
replevin
action
rests
on
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
would
the
federal
law
govern
it
or
not?
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
why
wouldn't
it?
mr.
jerome
feit
excuse
me
that
why
state
law
would
not
be
applicable?
mr.
jerome
feit
i
thought
that
my
position
is
that
state
law
would
be
applicable
because
the
cause
of
action
as
a
common
law
basis,
did
not
arise
from
the
constitution
in
the
fourth
amendment.
the
constitution
essentially
is
that
historical
basis,
i
think
clearly
shows,
was
aimed
at
securing
that
right
and
creating
of
the
rule
that
you
could
not
rely
upon
writs
of
assistance
and
the
general
warrants
for
justification.
mr.
jerome
feit
assuming
a
cause
of
action
for
trespass,
false
imprisonment,
of
that
nature
against
a
federal
officer.
mr.
jerome
feit
possibly
replevin
--
mr.
jerome
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
--
mr.
jerome
feit
as
i
say
it
may
--
mr.
jerome
feit
correct.
mr.
jerome
feit
that's
removed
to
the
federal
court
--
mr.
jerome
feit
he
is
a
federal
officer.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
you
have
then
in
a
sense
in
which
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
other
second
point
again,
the
thing
you
have
just
then
it
seems
to
us
is
the
creation
of
a
constitutional
cause
of
action.
mr.
jerome
feit
because
if
you
do
--
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
defects
in
creating
that
kind
of
remedy,
even
if
it
isn't
a
constitutional
tort
in
that
sense
could
congress
then
change
it
as
against
federal
officers.
mr.
jerome
feit
and
secondly,
for
example,
if
you
recognize
the
existence
of
this
federal
cause
of
action,
might
it
not
be
or
have
an
over
deterring
effect
on
federal
officers.
again,
its
against
wheeler
and
wheeldin
which
was
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago,
where
this
court
refused
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
from
a
statute
dealing
with
the
granting
of
process
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
that
we're
not
in
the
free
wheeling
days
of
erie
against
tompkins.
essentially
our
position
are
on
the
cause
of
action
issue
is
that
we're
concerned
as
to
what
may
be
the
consequences
of
that
creation,
of
that
kind
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
suing
individual
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
possibilities
that
congress
may
not
act.
it's
a
kind
of
an
area
where
what
are
the
burden
--
what
are
the
natures
of
the
remedies
that
should
be
afforded
are
quite
difficult
to
determine.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
counsel's
judicial
restraint
and
--
requires
legislative
or
perhaps
congressional
action
in
the
area.
mr.
jerome
feit
the
remedy
asked
for
here
was
$15,000.00
against
each
federal
officer.
mr.
jerome
feit
no,
it
does
not.
that's
fairly
clear
on.
i've
tried
to
indicate
the
reasons
why
we
feel,
however,
that
the
court
should
not
create
the
cause
of
action
for
reasons
of
as
we
have
tried
--
as
i've
tried
to
say,
for
fear
that
it
might
create
a
constitutional
tort,
limit
the
congress.
but
if
the
court
should
reject
our
view,
if
i
may
use
my
remaining
time
on
my
remaining
issue,
and
should
reject
our
view
and
determine
at
the
cause
of
action
for
damages
should
be
created
on
the
fourth
--
under
the
fourth
amendment,
so
that
this
was
properly
brought
in
the
federal
courts.
we
strongly
urge
that
it
should
not
now
decide
the
question
of
official
immunity
pressed
upon
it
by
petitioner.
what
petitioner
says
so
and
the
record
can
read
both
ways.
it's
not
clear
that
the
district
court
reached
that
issue.
but
even
if
it
did,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did
not.
it
clearly
refrained
from
reaching
the
question
of
immunity.
the
only
facts
in
the
record
consists
of
petitioner's
brief
complaint,
his
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
and
its
accompanying
affidavit.
without
a
hearing,
the
district
court
dismissed
in
a
short
memorandum
on
the
ground
that
it
have
no
jurisdiction
and
it
subsequent
memorandum
denying
the
motion
to
appeal
at
in
forma
pauperis,
found
additionally
that
no
cause
of
action
had
been
stated.
the
record
i
think
is,
in
our
judgment,
is
wholly
inadequate
to
permit
an
informed
judgment
as
to
whether
the
agents
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
duties.
it
may
well
be
on
the
development
of
the
facts
that
the
agents
were
indeed
acting
with
probable
cause.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
plaintiff
complaint
if
one
reads
the
record
at
page
one
and
two
for
example
that's
set
forth
in
monroe
v.
pape
where
13
chicago
police
officers
entered
early
hours
in
the
morning
and
forced
mr.
monroe
and
his
family
to
stand
naked,
then
took
mr.
monroe
down
to
headquarters
for
intensive
investigation.
as
i
say
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
officers'
actions
maybe
explainable
as
completely
justified
under
the
fourth
amendment.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
maybe
able
to
assert
that
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
was
wholly
technical.
mr.
jerome
feit
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
should
--
mr.
jerome
feit
the
government
moved
to
dismissed
the
complaint.
and
moved
--
mr.
jerome
feit
and
file
an
affidavit
relying
on
part
on
the
claim
that
the
action
was
brought
under
the
civil
rights
statute.
mr.
jerome
feit
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
the
government
may
have
made
a
mistake
or
that
the
court
did
not
require,
the
district
court
did
not
require
further
governmental
affidavits
of
further
showing.
it
seems
to
us
the
government
--
that
this
court
should
--
that
this
court
should
not
be
required
to
decide
a
question
of
such
significance
as
the
barr
and
matteo
proposition
on
this
kind
of
barren
record.
thus,
if
--
it
seems
to
us
under
the
procedures
for
relief
based
upon
the
new
federal
rules
of
procedure,
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
further
affidavit
should
be
submitted
to
permit
the
record
to
be
flushed
out.
and
this
court
should
not
reach
on
this
very
barren
context,
this
very
significant
question
as
to
the
scope
of
the
immunity
doctrine
as
applied
to
federal
agents.
mr.
jerome
feit
i
think
the
suggestion
was
not
made
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
courts
of
appeals
specifically
however,
refrained.
the
government
argued
barr
and
matteo
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
specifically
refrained
from
deciding
that
question
finding
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
available,
pleading
that
it
should
not
create
one
because
of
the
rule
of
exclusion
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
the
creation
of
such
remedy.
for
these
reasons,
it
is
our
basic
position
that
the
court
should
not
create
a
constitutional
tort
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
and
if
it
disagrees
with
us
on
this
issue,
however,
we
strongly
urge
that
it
not
reach
the
immunity
issue,
since
no
record
exists
upon
which
that
issue
can
fairly
be
decided.
it
should
instead
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
further
development
of
the
record
on
that
issue
and
on
other
possible
issues
of
justification
for
the
official
action.
thank
you.
