mr.
stephen
a.
grant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
25
years
have
elapsed
since
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
in
bell
against
hood,
left
for
another
day
the
question
whether
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
gives
rise
to
a
federal
claim
for
damages.
after
long
last
that
question
is
once
again
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case.
briefly
the
facts;
the
name
of
the
case,
bivens
against
six
unknown
federal
agents
in
a
way
tells
a
story.
began
in
the
early
morning
darkness
in
november
five
years
ago,
when
six
narcotics
agents
with
guns
drawn
forced
their
way
into
bivens'
home
in
bronx
and
preceded
to
conduct
a
thorough
and
apparently
fruitful
search.
they
put
handcuffs
on
him
in
front
of
his
wife
and
children.
they
took
him
away
to
be
further
questioned
and
booked
as
well
as
subjected
to
an
extremely
thorough
humiliating
search
of
his
person.
at
all
times
the
agents
acted
without
legal
authority,
without
a
search
or
arrest
warrant.
after
complaint
against
bivens
was
dismissed,
(inaudible)
to
hire
a
lawyer,
he
decided
to
sue
the
agents
for
the
outrage
he'd
suffered.
he
knew
the
us
constitution
guaranteed
to
each
citizen
the
right
to
be
secured
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
he
knew
that
the
federal
courts
had
general
jurisdiction
over
cases
arising
under
the
constitution.
he
must
naively
have
thought
he
had
a
pretty
good
case.
with
able
assistance
of
the
us
attorneys'
office,
the
district
court
made
a
short
trip
to
bivens
handwritten
compliant.
no
statute
afforded
a
remedy
against
federal
officers.
in
any
case,
the
defendants
had
acted
in
their
performance
of
duty,
compliant
dismissed.
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
denied,
and
the
district
court
judge's
certification
that
an
appeal
with
frivolous.
fortunately
for
bivens,
a
distinguished
judge
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
considered
the
appeal
not
so
frivolous.
leave
was
granted
and
i
was
assigned
counsel.
this
time
the
department
of
justice
represented
the
defendants,
arguing
with
the
admirable
dexterity
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
intended
simply
to
bar
the
defensive
privilege
for
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
the
privilege
is
nevertheless
available
here
because
the
defendants
had
acted
within
the
outer
perimeter
of
their
line
of
duty.
the
circuit
panel
was
impressed
by
the
lack
of
precedent
affording
a
damage
remedy
and
concluded
that
in
enforcing
the
fourth
amendment,
was
the
matter
for
the
congress.
it
recognized
that
the
privilege
question
was
properly
raised.
the
ruling
that
bivens
had
no
cause
of
action
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
issue.
the
judgment
dismissing
the
compliant
was
affirmed.
the
first
question,
the
first
issue
is
whether
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
to
be
secure
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
gives
rise
to
a
federal
claim
for
damages.
the
answer
turns
first
in
the
intent
of
the
framers;
second,
on
the
adequacy
of
existing
remedies
to
fulfill
that
intent
and
finally
on
the
role
of
the
court's
in
enforcing
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
first
the
intent
of
the
framers;
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
in
their
person's
house,
his
papers
and
affects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated.
these
words
were
of
course
a
promise
to
the
people,
and
an
imperative
to
the
executive,
but
perhaps
most
important
of
all
to
man
acutely
aware
of
the
problems,
practical
problems
of
controlling
governmental
power,
they
were
special
mandate
to
the
judiciary,
it
stood
between
the
people
and
their
government.
this
is
clear
from
madison's
famous
statement
that
if
the
bill
of
rights
were
incorporated
into
the
constitution,
independent
tribunals
of
justice
would
consider
themselves
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
guardians
of
those
rights,
and
would
resist
every
encroachment
by
the
legislative
or
executive.
the
framers
didn't
say
how
the
courts
would
act
as
guardians.
how
they
were
to
resist
the
encroachments
sooner
or
later
must
come,
they
didn't
have
to.
as
the
members
of
this
court
well
know,
the
amendment
itself
was
based
on
one
of
the
great
landmarks
of
english
constitutional
law,
entick
against
carrington.
the
civil
action
in
trespass
against
the
king's
messengers
for
search
and
seizure
conducted
under
the
invalid
authority
of
a
general
warrant.
lord
camden's
renowned
denunciation
of
unjustifiable
government
intrusions
in
1765
was
well
known
to
the
colonists
in
their
struggles
against
the
king's
custom
officers
prior
to
the
revolution.
there
was,
as
this
court
noted
several
times
in
a
very
minds
of
the
framers
when
they
drafted
the
fourth
amendment,
and
with
the
entick
case
in
mind,
they
were
no
doubt
confident
that
the
courts
would
enforce
the
constitutional
guarantee
by
the
traditional
remedy
of
civil
damages.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes,
your
honor.
on
remand
to
the
district
court,
the
plaintiff's
claim
for
federal
claim
was
rejected
on
the
merits
on
the
theory
that
if
the
agents
--
it
was
either
claim
against
the
agent
personally,
in
which
case
they
were
immune
from
suit
or
if
it
was
a
claim
against
the
government,
they
were
also
immune
under
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
was
affirmed,
i
believe
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
was
where
the
matter
rested.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
think
that
is
an
extraordinary
question
and
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
for
later,
if
i
can.
i
think
that's
one
of
extraordinary
questions
in
this
case.
having
said
this
much
as
to
which
i
believe
there
is
no
disagreement,
the
precise
question
becomes
the
presumed
intent
of
framers
as
to
the
application
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
in
such
a
civil
damage
action,
our
position
is
that
federal
common
law
is
the
source
of
the
plaintiff's
right
that
the
constitutional
guarantee
provides
a
basis
in
federal
law
for
all
subsequent
incidents
of
the
suit,
including
the
claim
itself
whether
there's
been
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
the
measure
of
damages,
and
the
scope
of
the
officer's
defense.
in
saying
this,
i
rely
first
and
foremost
on
the
language
of
the
amendment
which
says
that,
“the
constitutional
freedom
shall
not
be
violated,
speaking
in
categorical
terms
of
securing
the
fundamental
right
and
in
no
way
suggesting
a
more
limited
application
such
as
merely
foreclosing
a
defense
in
a
suit.”
and
i
rely
secondly,
on
the
historical
background,
on
the
very
fact
that
the
amendment's
adoption
at
a
time
when
everyone
knew
that
common
law
under
entick
against
carrington
already
protected
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
the
amendment
meant
nothing,
unless
it
elevated
the
common
law
right
to
the
level
of
the
guarantee
that
could
not
negated
by
the
state
or
even
federal
law.
and
it
meant
little
as
a
guarantee
of
it
was
merely
lofty
statement
of
principle,
a
right
without
a
remedy,
depended
on
legislative
action
for
its
enforcement
or
was
otherwise
subject
to
the
vicissitudes
of
state
law.
how
little
indeed
when
we
consider
that
the
congress
has
enacted
in
180
years
and
under
the
uncertainties
of
varying
local
rules,
remedy
under
state
law
has
become
all
but
completely
impotent.
the
government
however
argues
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
speak
of
vicissitudes
not
in
the
sense
--
vicissitudes
in
the
sense
that
state
law
has
developed
in
response
to
different
considerations
in
the
area
of
trespass
and
those
considerations
are
more
or
less
developed
in
all
of
the
50
states.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
certainly
did,
your
honor.
but
it
developed
with
respect
to
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
this
out
in
monroe
against
pape.
it
developed
in
a
context
where
the
only
question
was
a
private
right
of
action
against
another
private
citizen
and
the
facts,
the
measure
of
recovery
particularly,
the
question
whether
you
could
only
recover
for
the
damages
to
--
physical
damage
to
property.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
if
they
do,
which
i
cannot
answer
when
you
say
is
any
of
the
fact
because
i
do
not
know,
but
if
they
do,
again,
i
would
rely
on
the
argument
that
it
happens
to
be
a
coincidence
than
which
state
does
and
which
state
doesn't,
and
what
principles
govern
that
cause
of
action
as
well.
and
it's
precisely
that
element
of
chance
and
what
state
you're
in
and
whether
state
law
happens
to
provide
for
it,
that
i
don't
think
a
federal
right
can
prevail.
the
government
however,
argues
that
the
framers
must
have
been
thinking
in
procedural
terms,
merely
a
foreclosing
the
defense
of
justification,
that
the
amendment
was
intended
simply
to
bar
a
claim,
that
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
was
justified
in
the
name
of
the
law.
the
argument
is
weak
at
both
ends.
first
it
tests
too
little.
in
failing
to
explain
how
under
a
long
line
of
decisions
upholding
constitutional
claims
in
equity,
the
amendment
could
provide
the
basis
for
one
type
of
relief
but
another.
emphasis
in
decisions
clearly
suggests,
an
injunction
would
be
available
to
bar
threat
in
fourth
amendment
violation.
surely,
this
must
be
because
the
framer's
intent
in
a
federal
interest
goes
beyond
procedural
niceties
like
foreclosing
defenses
to
the
very
securing
of
the
constitutional
right.
yet,
how
can
this
interest
be
sufficient
for
an
injunction
and
not
for
damages,
particularly
under
a
system
of
law
where
equitable
relief
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government's
position
says
too
much.
for
the
mere
fact,
a
foreclosing
the
justification
defense,
implies
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
framers
to
vindicate
the
constitutional
right
by
an
award
of
civil
damages.
yet,
if
absent
congressional
actions
state
law
were
intended
to
govern
the
plaintiff's
claim,
then
the
states
we
are
in
are
free,
not
only
to
leave
the
right
uncertain
as
it
now
is
but
even
to
oppose
affirmative
obstacles
or
bar
a
civil
remedy
all
together.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
want
to
make
my
position
very
clear
that
these
--
the
two
questions
are
very
definitely
raised
in
this
case,
but
i
want
to
focus
on
the
substantive
law
in
particular
and
not
on
the
question
of
which
forum
the
case
is
decided.
to
my
mind,
if
the
plaintiff
is
sued
in
the
state
court,
the
law
that
should
govern
this
claim
is
federal
law
because
it's
the
federal
right
that
he
will
be
seeking
to
vindicate.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that's
right!
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
certainly
could.
the
government's
final
argument
is
that
the
framers
cannot
have
intended
to
create
a
federal
law
--
cause
of
action
because
if
they
had
the
federal
courts
would
at
the
outset
have
been
given
jurisdictional
of
the
cases
arising
under
the
constitution.
the
logic
of
this
position
compels
a
conclusion
that
the
congress
can
similarly
not
have
intended
to
create
any
enforceable
federal
rights
on
the
statutes
until
1875,
when
the
original
jurisdiction
was
finally
granted.
now
obviously,
this
wasn't
true.
the
framers
and
the
congress
assumed
that
the
federal
rights
would
be
enforced
in
the
state
courts.
in
the
effectiveness
of
this
enforcement
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
assured
by
then
accepted
omnipresence
of
the
common
law.
for
when
the
amendment
was
adopted,
entick
against
carrington,
was
assumed
to
be
the
common
law
throughout
the
land.
there
can
hardly
have
been
any
compelling
need
for
original
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
state
courts
could
be
expected
to
enforce
the
principles
of
entick
with
the
uniformity
derived
from
common
custom
and
tradition.
indeed,
there
was
little
need
to
distinguish
between
state
and
federal
common
law
rights
for
well
over
century
afterward,
when
under
the
philosophy
of
swift
against
tyson,
the
common
law
was
regarded
as
single
and
cohesive
body
of
principles.
this
is
why
slocum
against
mayberry
on
which
the
government
heavily
relies
for
its
view,
in
fact
what's
precisely
the
other
way.
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
court,
what
chief
justice
marshall
did
say,
was
the
damages
were
to
be
sought
in
“suit
at
common
law”
but
that
the
“common
law
tribunals
of
united
states”
were
not
available
to
hear
the
claim
because
congress
had
not
given
them
jurisdiction.
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
suit
had
to
therefore
be
brought
in
the
state
court.
but
contrary
to
the
government's
suggestion,
what
he
did
not
say,
was
that,
“the
claim
therefore
arose
under
and
was
governed
by
state
law.”
for
him
and
indeed
for
the
courts
for
many
years
afterwards
such
a
parochial
dissection
of
the
common
law
was
unthinkable.
and
thus
it
is
that
the
question
of
the
governing
law
becomes
vital
only
when
the
common
law
becomes
what
the
court
said
is
in
fact,
when
under
erie
against
tompkins,
the
pronouncements
of
state
judges
are
recognized
as
binding
on
the
federal
courts
and
when
asserting
that
the
claim
arises
under
and
is
governed
by
state
law
may
defeat
the
federal
right.
and
in
this
context,
i
repeat,
in
this
context,
looking
at
the
language
and
the
background
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
inconceivable
that
the
framers
could
have
intended
its
enforcement
to
be
subject
to
compromise
under
state
law.
and
the
rights
recognized
in
entick
against
carrington
forfeited
because
of
congressional
inaction.
turning
to
the
second
issue,
the
adequacy
of
existing
remedies.
from
the
framer's
intent
to
its
fulfillment,
it
is
arguable
at
least
in
principle
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
court
should
look
to
state
law
in
civil
damage
actions
for
unreasonable
searches
until
the
congress
says
otherwise.
but
surely
this
turns
most
of
all,
on
whether
the
framer's
intent
would
thereby
be
fulfilled.
the
court
below
concluded
that
it
would.
the
plaintiff
should
be
left
to
sue
under
the
state
law
because
the
existing
remedies
substantially
vindicate
fourth
amendment
rights.
with
due
respect
this
conclusion
cannot
be
sustained.
it
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
against
ohio
and
monroe
against
pape,
both
of
which
required
overriding
substantial
state
interests
because
i
said
in
the
mapp,
existing
civil
remedies
under
state
law
were
worthless
and
futile.
moreover,
given
federal
rules
under
the
civil
rights
act
against
state
officers
and
the
variety
in
local
rules,
and
this
is
the
point
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
the
variety
in
local
rules
from
state
to
state,
it
means
that
identical
conduct
and
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
will
give
rise
to
liability,
if
committed
by
a
state
but
not
a
federal
officer
and
if
committed
in
one
jurisdiction
but
not
in
another.
at
least
enforcement
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
subject
to
the
accidents
of
which
badge
the
defendant
is
wearing
and
on
which
side
of
a
particular
state
boundary
he
happens
to
act.
and
in
terms
of
the
larger
question
of
the
detouring
police
misconduct,
the
lower
court's
conclusion
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
results
of
more
detailed
studies
but
scholar
in
the
field.
the
most
extensive
worked
today
which
no
doubt
the
members
of
the
court
have
seen
is
that
professor
oaks
of
the
university
of
chicago
law
school.
his
recently
published
article
is
cited
on
page
31
of
the
under
the
government's
brief.
he
concludes
that
the
exclusionary
rule
has
a
as
relatively
little
impact
as
a
deterrent
to
police
misconduct,
as
most
police
activity
is
directed
not
at
securing
evidence
for
prosecution,
but
apprehending
criminals
and
maintaining
order.
more
important,
he
sights
evidence
in
canada
that
suggests
that
a
civil
remedy
is
reasonably
effective
in
curbing
the
police
and
strongly
urges
that
such
a
remedy
be
given
a
chance
to
do
job
here.
turning
finally
to
the
role
of
the
courts;
what
is
the
responsibility
of
the
courts
when
a
aggrieved
citizen
in
this
theory
to
vindicate
a
claim
based
on
the
naked
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
of
course,
the
government
executive
insists
that
court
shouldn't
act.
they
argue
and
i
quote,
“that
there
must
be
showing
of
utmost
necessity.
it
must
be
vital,
indispensable,
essential,
and
absolutely
necessary
and
having
themselves
so
restrictively
set
the
stage
and
the
question
to
be
so
decided.
they
proceed
to
argue
that
ineffectual
state
remedies
are
nonetheless
not
totally
worthless
that
the
matter
should
be
left
to
a
congress
that
hasn't
enacted
in
180
years.”
to
all
this
i
would
say
only
three
things.
first,
if
indeed
necessity
must
be
shown
for
the
courts
to
act.
it
is
here
as
plaintiffs
anything
can
be.
if
the
need
to
protect
fourth
amendment
rights
requires
the
courts
to
suppress
reliable
evidence
in
criminal
prosecutions
at
the
expense
of
the
society,
surely
it
provides
a
basis
for
a
civil
tort
remedy.
it
would
be
available
to
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
alike
and
place
the
burden
on
the
irresponsible
police
officer
where
it
more
properly
belong.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
there
are
two
different
questions.
one
is
whether
the
plaintiff
has
a
cause
of
action
and
developing
the
federal
rule
and
one
which
i
think
your
questions
is
directed
to
which
is
that
defendant's
defense
of
privilege
which
should
be
sufficiently
broad
to
protect
a
policeman
acting
reasonably
in
discharging
his
duty.
and
i
think
your
question
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
certainly
accept
that.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
even
though
it
was
quite
wrong.
if
he
reasonably
believed
that
he
had
probable
cause
that
should
be
a
sufficient
defense
in
my
view
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
pierson
against
ray.
but
i
think
it's
a
separate
question
from
whether
the
plaintiff
has
the
right
sue,
he
has
the
federal
right
that
should
be
govern
by
the
federal
rules,
that's
already
governed
by
federal
rule.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
don't
think
i
said
that
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
on
that
--
i
think
that
this
is
beyond
the
scope
of
what
the
court
--
no,
i'm
not
so
sure.
if
the
court
goes
on
to
decide,
which
i
urge
you
to
do
that
barr
against
matteo
should
be
explained
as
applying
to
definition
with
respect
to
its
discussion
within
the
outer
perimeter
of
line
of
duty
then
it
should
indicate
what
the
defense
of
governmental
privilege
is
in
trespass
and
the
basis
for
that
defense
is
established
in
the
traditional
cases
in
trespass
and
in
pierson
against
ray
and
that
would
be
privilege
for
the
officer's
reasonable
conduct
in
discharging
his
duty
and
that
is
not
subject
to
good
faith
and
i
don't
think
society
has
an
interest
in
subjective
law
enforcement.
if
the
other
people
and
society
for
held
up
to
standard
of
reasonable
conduct,
i
think
the
police
should
be
as
well.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
no,
it
would
not
be
the
same
test
because
the
question
–-
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
don't
think
it
would
stricter
test
and
also,
i
think
when
you
take
the
practical
question
of
suing
an
officer
who's
trying
to
do
his
duty
personal
liability
in
front
of
a
civil
jury
that
in
effect
the
test
would
not
be
as
rigid
as
the
court
trying
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
for
instance.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
think
the
question
now
is
the
privilege
of
the
officer
which
is
a
defense
in
a
suit
for
a
personal
liability
whereas
the
question,
for
instance,
of
the
probable
cause
at
least
were
it
has
risen
for
the
most
part
has
been
in
whether
you
can
use
the
evidence
against
a
criminal
in
the
prosecution
and
i'm
not
they
are
the
same.
franky
i
wish
i
could
give
you
satisfactory
answer
to
that.
i
don't
think
i
can.
but
i
will
move
on
right
to
the
second
question
since
i
have
only
have
a
minute.
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
in
preliminary
papers
that
the
government
invoked
the
defense
of
governmental
privilege
in
the
district
court
as
well
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
even
urged
the
circuit
court
to
go
so
far
as
to
sustain
the
defense
in
the
face
of
clear
and
conscious
violation
of
the
constitution
and
they
cited
three
circuit
court
decisions
to
that
effect
which
i
noted
on
pages
20
and
21
on
my
brief.
now
that
the
issue
is
finally
in
front
of
this
court,
they
say
that
the
same
complaint
preliminary
papers
afford
insufficient
facts
to
--
for
an
informed
judgment.
obviously,
suggesting
that
on
remand
there
would
be
additional
facts
to
excuse
the
defendants.
i
think
clearly
problem
is
not
with
the
facts,
with
the
judgment.
it
has
to
be
reversed
and
reversed
by
this
court
because
it
has
arisen.
because
this
court's
pronouncement
since
following
its
(inaudible)
barr
v.
mateo
where
misapplied
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
norton
against
mcshane
to
shield
an
unconstitutional
arrest
and
detention.
the
first
circuit
has
already
rejected
the
norton
decision.
remanding
the
issue
here
to
the
second
circuit
will
simply
perpetuate
a
conflict
that
can
only
be
resolved
by
this
court.
and
so
the
position
of
the
petitioner
are
very
--
we
very
strongly
urge
that
this
issue
is
in
the
case
and
that
it
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
portion
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i'll
make
only
a
few
remarks
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
bench.
first,
when
you
ask
whether
--
if
state
law
governs
this
claim.
if
state
law
governs
this
claim,
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
we
are
out
of
the
court
if
mr.
feit
is
correct
in
saying
the
state
statute
of
limitations
bars
a
suit.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
because
i
think
we
brought
it
two
years
after
the
trespass
and
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
question
that
and
there
are
obviously,
others
issues
beside
the
damages
that
would
bear
on
the
federal
right.
what
is
required
here
is
not
as
the
government
so
strongly
suggests
creating
a
new
cause
of
action,
in
the
sense
of
defining
a
new
and
certainly
not
a
constitutional
tort.
here,
unlike
wheeldin
against
wheeler,
we
already
have
in
the
constitution
of
prescription
against
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
the
tort
of
trespass
is
as
old
any
of
common
law.
this
court
is
asked
to
hold
nothing
more
than
in
such
a
time
honored
claim
on
trespass
is
governed
by
federal
law
when
based
on
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
and
what
is
required
would
not,
again,
as
the
government
suggests,
freeze
fourth
amendment
remedies
in
a
mold
that
can
only
be
broken
by
a
constitutional
amendment.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not
redefining
the
fourth
amendment
but
about
its
enforcement
being
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
free
from
local
rules.
such
common
law
could
consistent
with
the
amendment
be
changed
by
legislative
action
and
even
if
the
right
to
damages
where
called
the
constitutional
right,
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
congress
from
acquiring
a
claim
to
be
asserted
against
the
government
itself
or
providing
for
indemnity
for
its
officers.
finally,
what
we
are
asking
would
not
has
worried
the
court
below,
lead
down
a
long
and
uncertain
road
in
creating
federal
rules
or
even
open
a
pandora's
box
of
civil
litigation
to
vindicate
constitutional
claims.
the
courts
and
particularly
the
federal
court's
responsibility
to
formulate
federal
rules
and
to
determine
the
difficult
question
which
constitutional
violations
give
rise
to
damage
claims
is
already
present
under
the
civil
rights
act.
recognizing
the
federal
nature
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
here
would
be,
if
the
courts
later
so
wished
an
easily
distinguished
decision
resting
as
it
must,
not
merely
on
the
face
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
on
the
specific
intent
of
the
framers
and
on
the
background
of
common
law
that
imposed
personal
liability.
in
concluding,
i
would
like
to
return
of
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
a
thought
that
i
suggested
at
the
beginning.
for
me
its
extra
ordinary
that
the
fundamental
questions
in
this
case
raised
with
this
court's
decision.
over
200
years
after,
they
were
settled
in
england
in
entick
against
carrington,
in
180
years
after
the
framers
attempted
to
incorporate
the
promise
of
entick
into
the
fourth
amendment
and
as
i
said,
25
years
after
this
court
so
pointedly
suggested
the
availability
of
a
federal
claim
and
bell
against
hood,
the
explanation,
as
the
courts
know
too
well,
does
not
lie
in
any
dearth
of
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
such
abuses
continue,
and
apparently
unabated
by
judicial
suppression
of
the
legally
seized
evidence.
obviously,
there
is
something
fundamentally
wrong
in
the
understanding
of
the
people
and
of
the
police
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
it
is
in
a
practical
sense
a
guarantee
that
can,
and
will
be
enforced.
if
there's
to
be
a
change,
it
will
not
come
from
simply
sustaining
the
right
to
sue
in
federal
court
and
as
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
the
civil
right
act
was
recognize
over
10
years
ago,
and
yet
the
use
of
the
civil
rights
act
remedy
has
been
minimal.
stronger
medicine
is
needed.
a
reaffirmation
of
the
citizens
right
under
federal
law
and
the
government's
liability
in
clear
and
resounding
terms
that
will
be
heard
and
understood
by
the
people
and
by
the
police
and
from
where
would
it
come.
from
a
congress
that
recently
authorized
no
knock
entry
by
the
police,
clearly
not.
it
will
be
from
this
court
or
not
at
all
and
looking
at
the
25
years
between
bell
against
hood
today,
it
would
now
a
very
possibly
never
or
no
time.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
this
court
would
hold
that
the
plaintiff
had
a
right
under
the
constitution
for
compensation
for
violation
of
fourth
amendment,
such
a
law,
i
believe
would
be
in
derogation
of
fourth
amendment,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
doesn't
have
considerable
flexibility.
as
i
pointed
out,
they
could
easily
adopt
a
bill
that
would
require
like
the
federal
torts
claim
act.
all
they
have
to
do
would
be
the
modify
it
so
that
the
suit
could
be
brought
against
the
government.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
would
certainly
differ
to
the
court's
judgment
but
that
would
be
my
position,
yes.
i
believe
it
would
be
in
derogation
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
such
a
statute.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that
is
precisely
why
i
insist
that
the
question
is
not
simply
jurisdictional
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
to
that
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that
would
be
fine,
the
suits
will
be
brought
in
the
state
courts,
but
the
point
is
that
the
law
in
the
state
courts
would
be
federal
law
and
it
would
be
subject
to
being
brought
up
to
this
court,
and
the
rules
hopefully
would
be
loud
and
clear
on
the
right
to
damages
for
all
kinds
of
suffering,
and
the
rule
on
the
defendant's
liability
would
be
equally
clear.
and
so,
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
vindicated
in
the
state
courts.
that
of
course
were
the
system
prior
to
1875
exactly
there.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that
is
very
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
but
the
question
--
there
is
no
question
that
mapp
against
ohio
rested
very
strongly
on
the
inadequacy
of
other
remedies.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
think
that's
right
but
there
made
very
well
be
room
once
the
underpinning
of
the
inadequacy
of
civil
remedies
if
there
were
effective
civil
remedy
for
an
argument
that
it
is
essential
in
a
case
where
it
is
being
used
with
an
over
reaching
part
--
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
prosecute
the
defendant
and
in
that
type
of
case
maybe
it
is
certainly
an
essential
part
where
is
in
the
technical
case
where
there
is
no
over
reaching
no
authorization
from
higher
government
officers
then
perhaps,
once
the
other
basis
is
removed
the
question
should
be
reexamined.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
certainly
might.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
25
years
have
elapsed
since
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
in
bell
against
hood,
left
for
another
day
the
question
whether
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
gives
rise
to
a
federal
claim
for
damages.
after
long
last
that
question
is
once
again
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case.
briefly
the
facts;
the
name
of
the
case,
bivens
against
six
unknown
federal
agents
in
a
way
tells
a
story.
began
in
the
early
morning
darkness
in
november
five
years
ago,
when
six
narcotics
agents
with
guns
drawn
forced
their
way
into
bivens'
home
in
bronx
and
preceded
to
conduct
a
thorough
and
apparently
fruitful
search.
they
put
handcuffs
on
him
in
front
of
his
wife
and
children.
they
took
him
away
to
be
further
questioned
and
booked
as
well
as
subjected
to
an
extremely
thorough
humiliating
search
of
his
person.
at
all
times
the
agents
acted
without
legal
authority,
without
a
search
or
arrest
warrant.
after
complaint
against
bivens
was
dismissed,
(inaudible)
to
hire
a
lawyer,
he
decided
to
sue
the
agents
for
the
outrage
he'd
suffered.
he
knew
the
us
constitution
guaranteed
to
each
citizen
the
right
to
be
secured
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
he
knew
that
the
federal
courts
had
general
jurisdiction
over
cases
arising
under
the
constitution.
he
must
naively
have
thought
he
had
a
pretty
good
case.
with
able
assistance
of
the
us
attorneys'
office,
the
district
court
made
a
short
trip
to
bivens
handwritten
compliant.
no
statute
afforded
a
remedy
against
federal
officers.
in
any
case,
the
defendants
had
acted
in
their
performance
of
duty,
compliant
dismissed.
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
denied,
and
the
district
court
judge's
certification
that
an
appeal
with
frivolous.
fortunately
for
bivens,
a
distinguished
judge
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
considered
the
appeal
not
so
frivolous.
leave
was
granted
and
i
was
assigned
counsel.
this
time
the
department
of
justice
represented
the
defendants,
arguing
with
the
admirable
dexterity
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
intended
simply
to
bar
the
defensive
privilege
for
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
the
privilege
is
nevertheless
available
here
because
the
defendants
had
acted
within
the
outer
perimeter
of
their
line
of
duty.
the
circuit
panel
was
impressed
by
the
lack
of
precedent
affording
a
damage
remedy
and
concluded
that
in
enforcing
the
fourth
amendment,
was
the
matter
for
the
congress.
it
recognized
that
the
privilege
question
was
properly
raised.
the
ruling
that
bivens
had
no
cause
of
action
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
issue.
the
judgment
dismissing
the
compliant
was
affirmed.
the
first
question,
the
first
issue
is
whether
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
to
be
secure
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
gives
rise
to
a
federal
claim
for
damages.
the
answer
turns
first
in
the
intent
of
the
framers;
second,
on
the
adequacy
of
existing
remedies
to
fulfill
that
intent
and
finally
on
the
role
of
the
court's
in
enforcing
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
first
the
intent
of
the
framers;
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
in
their
person's
house,
his
papers
and
affects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated.
these
words
were
of
course
a
promise
to
the
people,
and
an
imperative
to
the
executive,
but
perhaps
most
important
of
all
to
man
acutely
aware
of
the
problems,
practical
problems
of
controlling
governmental
power,
they
were
special
mandate
to
the
judiciary,
it
stood
between
the
people
and
their
government.
this
is
clear
from
madison's
famous
statement
that
if
the
bill
of
rights
were
incorporated
into
the
constitution,
independent
tribunals
of
justice
would
consider
themselves
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
guardians
of
those
rights,
and
would
resist
every
encroachment
by
the
legislative
or
executive.
the
framers
didn't
say
how
the
courts
would
act
as
guardians.
how
they
were
to
resist
the
encroachments
sooner
or
later
must
come,
they
didn't
have
to.
as
the
members
of
this
court
well
know,
the
amendment
itself
was
based
on
one
of
the
great
landmarks
of
english
constitutional
law,
entick
against
carrington.
the
civil
action
in
trespass
against
the
king's
messengers
for
search
and
seizure
conducted
under
the
invalid
authority
of
a
general
warrant.
lord
camden's
renowned
denunciation
of
unjustifiable
government
intrusions
in
1765
was
well
known
to
the
colonists
in
their
struggles
against
the
king's
custom
officers
prior
to
the
revolution.
there
was,
as
this
court
noted
several
times
in
a
very
minds
of
the
framers
when
they
drafted
the
fourth
amendment,
and
with
the
entick
case
in
mind,
they
were
no
doubt
confident
that
the
courts
would
enforce
the
constitutional
guarantee
by
the
traditional
remedy
of
civil
damages.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes,
your
honor.
on
remand
to
the
district
court,
the
plaintiff's
claim
for
federal
claim
was
rejected
on
the
merits
on
the
theory
that
if
the
agents
--
it
was
either
claim
against
the
agent
personally,
in
which
case
they
were
immune
from
suit
or
if
it
was
a
claim
against
the
government,
they
were
also
immune
under
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
was
affirmed,
i
believe
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
was
where
the
matter
rested.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
think
that
is
an
extraordinary
question
and
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
for
later,
if
i
can.
i
think
that's
one
of
extraordinary
questions
in
this
case.
having
said
this
much
as
to
which
i
believe
there
is
no
disagreement,
the
precise
question
becomes
the
presumed
intent
of
framers
as
to
the
application
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
in
such
a
civil
damage
action,
our
position
is
that
federal
common
law
is
the
source
of
the
plaintiff's
right
that
the
constitutional
guarantee
provides
a
basis
in
federal
law
for
all
subsequent
incidents
of
the
suit,
including
the
claim
itself
whether
there's
been
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
the
measure
of
damages,
and
the
scope
of
the
officer's
defense.
in
saying
this,
i
rely
first
and
foremost
on
the
language
of
the
amendment
which
says
that,
“the
constitutional
freedom
shall
not
be
violated,
speaking
in
categorical
terms
of
securing
the
fundamental
right
and
in
no
way
suggesting
a
more
limited
application
such
as
merely
foreclosing
a
defense
in
a
suit.”
and
i
rely
secondly,
on
the
historical
background,
on
the
very
fact
that
the
amendment's
adoption
at
a
time
when
everyone
knew
that
common
law
under
entick
against
carrington
already
protected
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
the
amendment
meant
nothing,
unless
it
elevated
the
common
law
right
to
the
level
of
the
guarantee
that
could
not
negated
by
the
state
or
even
federal
law.
and
it
meant
little
as
a
guarantee
of
it
was
merely
lofty
statement
of
principle,
a
right
without
a
remedy,
depended
on
legislative
action
for
its
enforcement
or
was
otherwise
subject
to
the
vicissitudes
of
state
law.
how
little
indeed
when
we
consider
that
the
congress
has
enacted
in
180
years
and
under
the
uncertainties
of
varying
local
rules,
remedy
under
state
law
has
become
all
but
completely
impotent.
the
government
however
argues
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
speak
of
vicissitudes
not
in
the
sense
--
vicissitudes
in
the
sense
that
state
law
has
developed
in
response
to
different
considerations
in
the
area
of
trespass
and
those
considerations
are
more
or
less
developed
in
all
of
the
50
states.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
certainly
did,
your
honor.
but
it
developed
with
respect
to
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
this
out
in
monroe
against
pape.
it
developed
in
a
context
where
the
only
question
was
a
private
right
of
action
against
another
private
citizen
and
the
facts,
the
measure
of
recovery
particularly,
the
question
whether
you
could
only
recover
for
the
damages
to
--
physical
damage
to
property.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
if
they
do,
which
i
cannot
answer
when
you
say
is
any
of
the
fact
because
i
do
not
know,
but
if
they
do,
again,
i
would
rely
on
the
argument
that
it
happens
to
be
a
coincidence
than
which
state
does
and
which
state
doesn't,
and
what
principles
govern
that
cause
of
action
as
well.
and
it's
precisely
that
element
of
chance
and
what
state
you're
in
and
whether
state
law
happens
to
provide
for
it,
that
i
don't
think
a
federal
right
can
prevail.
the
government
however,
argues
that
the
framers
must
have
been
thinking
in
procedural
terms,
merely
a
foreclosing
the
defense
of
justification,
that
the
amendment
was
intended
simply
to
bar
a
claim,
that
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
was
justified
in
the
name
of
the
law.
the
argument
is
weak
at
both
ends.
first
it
tests
too
little.
in
failing
to
explain
how
under
a
long
line
of
decisions
upholding
constitutional
claims
in
equity,
the
amendment
could
provide
the
basis
for
one
type
of
relief
but
another.
emphasis
in
decisions
clearly
suggests,
an
injunction
would
be
available
to
bar
threat
in
fourth
amendment
violation.
surely,
this
must
be
because
the
framer's
intent
in
a
federal
interest
goes
beyond
procedural
niceties
like
foreclosing
defenses
to
the
very
securing
of
the
constitutional
right.
yet,
how
can
this
interest
be
sufficient
for
an
injunction
and
not
for
damages,
particularly
under
a
system
of
law
where
equitable
relief
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government's
position
says
too
much.
for
the
mere
fact,
a
foreclosing
the
justification
defense,
implies
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
framers
to
vindicate
the
constitutional
right
by
an
award
of
civil
damages.
yet,
if
absent
congressional
actions
state
law
were
intended
to
govern
the
plaintiff's
claim,
then
the
states
we
are
in
are
free,
not
only
to
leave
the
right
uncertain
as
it
now
is
but
even
to
oppose
affirmative
obstacles
or
bar
a
civil
remedy
all
together.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
want
to
make
my
position
very
clear
that
these
--
the
two
questions
are
very
definitely
raised
in
this
case,
but
i
want
to
focus
on
the
substantive
law
in
particular
and
not
on
the
question
of
which
forum
the
case
is
decided.
to
my
mind,
if
the
plaintiff
is
sued
in
the
state
court,
the
law
that
should
govern
this
claim
is
federal
law
because
it's
the
federal
right
that
he
will
be
seeking
to
vindicate.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that's
right!
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
certainly
could.
the
government's
final
argument
is
that
the
framers
cannot
have
intended
to
create
a
federal
law
--
cause
of
action
because
if
they
had
the
federal
courts
would
at
the
outset
have
been
given
jurisdictional
of
the
cases
arising
under
the
constitution.
the
logic
of
this
position
compels
a
conclusion
that
the
congress
can
similarly
not
have
intended
to
create
any
enforceable
federal
rights
on
the
statutes
until
1875,
when
the
original
jurisdiction
was
finally
granted.
now
obviously,
this
wasn't
true.
the
framers
and
the
congress
assumed
that
the
federal
rights
would
be
enforced
in
the
state
courts.
in
the
effectiveness
of
this
enforcement
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
assured
by
then
accepted
omnipresence
of
the
common
law.
for
when
the
amendment
was
adopted,
entick
against
carrington,
was
assumed
to
be
the
common
law
throughout
the
land.
there
can
hardly
have
been
any
compelling
need
for
original
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
state
courts
could
be
expected
to
enforce
the
principles
of
entick
with
the
uniformity
derived
from
common
custom
and
tradition.
indeed,
there
was
little
need
to
distinguish
between
state
and
federal
common
law
rights
for
well
over
century
afterward,
when
under
the
philosophy
of
swift
against
tyson,
the
common
law
was
regarded
as
single
and
cohesive
body
of
principles.
this
is
why
slocum
against
mayberry
on
which
the
government
heavily
relies
for
its
view,
in
fact
what's
precisely
the
other
way.
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
court,
what
chief
justice
marshall
did
say,
was
the
damages
were
to
be
sought
in
“suit
at
common
law”
but
that
the
“common
law
tribunals
of
united
states”
were
not
available
to
hear
the
claim
because
congress
had
not
given
them
jurisdiction.
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
suit
had
to
therefore
be
brought
in
the
state
court.
but
contrary
to
the
government's
suggestion,
what
he
did
not
say,
was
that,
“the
claim
therefore
arose
under
and
was
governed
by
state
law.”
for
him
and
indeed
for
the
courts
for
many
years
afterwards
such
a
parochial
dissection
of
the
common
law
was
unthinkable.
and
thus
it
is
that
the
question
of
the
governing
law
becomes
vital
only
when
the
common
law
becomes
what
the
court
said
is
in
fact,
when
under
erie
against
tompkins,
the
pronouncements
of
state
judges
are
recognized
as
binding
on
the
federal
courts
and
when
asserting
that
the
claim
arises
under
and
is
governed
by
state
law
may
defeat
the
federal
right.
and
in
this
context,
i
repeat,
in
this
context,
looking
at
the
language
and
the
background
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
inconceivable
that
the
framers
could
have
intended
its
enforcement
to
be
subject
to
compromise
under
state
law.
and
the
rights
recognized
in
entick
against
carrington
forfeited
because
of
congressional
inaction.
turning
to
the
second
issue,
the
adequacy
of
existing
remedies.
from
the
framer's
intent
to
its
fulfillment,
it
is
arguable
at
least
in
principle
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
court
should
look
to
state
law
in
civil
damage
actions
for
unreasonable
searches
until
the
congress
says
otherwise.
but
surely
this
turns
most
of
all,
on
whether
the
framer's
intent
would
thereby
be
fulfilled.
the
court
below
concluded
that
it
would.
the
plaintiff
should
be
left
to
sue
under
the
state
law
because
the
existing
remedies
substantially
vindicate
fourth
amendment
rights.
with
due
respect
this
conclusion
cannot
be
sustained.
it
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
against
ohio
and
monroe
against
pape,
both
of
which
required
overriding
substantial
state
interests
because
i
said
in
the
mapp,
existing
civil
remedies
under
state
law
were
worthless
and
futile.
moreover,
given
federal
rules
under
the
civil
rights
act
against
state
officers
and
the
variety
in
local
rules,
and
this
is
the
point
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
the
variety
in
local
rules
from
state
to
state,
it
means
that
identical
conduct
and
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
will
give
rise
to
liability,
if
committed
by
a
state
but
not
a
federal
officer
and
if
committed
in
one
jurisdiction
but
not
in
another.
at
least
enforcement
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
subject
to
the
accidents
of
which
badge
the
defendant
is
wearing
and
on
which
side
of
a
particular
state
boundary
he
happens
to
act.
and
in
terms
of
the
larger
question
of
the
detouring
police
misconduct,
the
lower
court's
conclusion
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
results
of
more
detailed
studies
but
scholar
in
the
field.
the
most
extensive
worked
today
which
no
doubt
the
members
of
the
court
have
seen
is
that
professor
oaks
of
the
university
of
chicago
law
school.
his
recently
published
article
is
cited
on
page
31
of
the
under
the
government's
brief.
he
concludes
that
the
exclusionary
rule
has
a
as
relatively
little
impact
as
a
deterrent
to
police
misconduct,
as
most
police
activity
is
directed
not
at
securing
evidence
for
prosecution,
but
apprehending
criminals
and
maintaining
order.
more
important,
he
sights
evidence
in
canada
that
suggests
that
a
civil
remedy
is
reasonably
effective
in
curbing
the
police
and
strongly
urges
that
such
a
remedy
be
given
a
chance
to
do
job
here.
turning
finally
to
the
role
of
the
courts;
what
is
the
responsibility
of
the
courts
when
a
aggrieved
citizen
in
this
theory
to
vindicate
a
claim
based
on
the
naked
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
of
course,
the
government
executive
insists
that
court
shouldn't
act.
they
argue
and
i
quote,
“that
there
must
be
showing
of
utmost
necessity.
it
must
be
vital,
indispensable,
essential,
and
absolutely
necessary
and
having
themselves
so
restrictively
set
the
stage
and
the
question
to
be
so
decided.
they
proceed
to
argue
that
ineffectual
state
remedies
are
nonetheless
not
totally
worthless
that
the
matter
should
be
left
to
a
congress
that
hasn't
enacted
in
180
years.”
to
all
this
i
would
say
only
three
things.
first,
if
indeed
necessity
must
be
shown
for
the
courts
to
act.
it
is
here
as
plaintiffs
anything
can
be.
if
the
need
to
protect
fourth
amendment
rights
requires
the
courts
to
suppress
reliable
evidence
in
criminal
prosecutions
at
the
expense
of
the
society,
surely
it
provides
a
basis
for
a
civil
tort
remedy.
it
would
be
available
to
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
alike
and
place
the
burden
on
the
irresponsible
police
officer
where
it
more
properly
belong.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
there
are
two
different
questions.
one
is
whether
the
plaintiff
has
a
cause
of
action
and
developing
the
federal
rule
and
one
which
i
think
your
questions
is
directed
to
which
is
that
defendant's
defense
of
privilege
which
should
be
sufficiently
broad
to
protect
a
policeman
acting
reasonably
in
discharging
his
duty.
and
i
think
your
question
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
certainly
accept
that.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
even
though
it
was
quite
wrong.
if
he
reasonably
believed
that
he
had
probable
cause
that
should
be
a
sufficient
defense
in
my
view
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
pierson
against
ray.
but
i
think
it's
a
separate
question
from
whether
the
plaintiff
has
the
right
sue,
he
has
the
federal
right
that
should
be
govern
by
the
federal
rules,
that's
already
governed
by
federal
rule.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
don't
think
i
said
that
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
on
that
--
i
think
that
this
is
beyond
the
scope
of
what
the
court
--
no,
i'm
not
so
sure.
if
the
court
goes
on
to
decide,
which
i
urge
you
to
do
that
barr
against
matteo
should
be
explained
as
applying
to
definition
with
respect
to
its
discussion
within
the
outer
perimeter
of
line
of
duty
then
it
should
indicate
what
the
defense
of
governmental
privilege
is
in
trespass
and
the
basis
for
that
defense
is
established
in
the
traditional
cases
in
trespass
and
in
pierson
against
ray
and
that
would
be
privilege
for
the
officer's
reasonable
conduct
in
discharging
his
duty
and
that
is
not
subject
to
good
faith
and
i
don't
think
society
has
an
interest
in
subjective
law
enforcement.
if
the
other
people
and
society
for
held
up
to
standard
of
reasonable
conduct,
i
think
the
police
should
be
as
well.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
no,
it
would
not
be
the
same
test
because
the
question
–-
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
don't
think
it
would
stricter
test
and
also,
i
think
when
you
take
the
practical
question
of
suing
an
officer
who's
trying
to
do
his
duty
personal
liability
in
front
of
a
civil
jury
that
in
effect
the
test
would
not
be
as
rigid
as
the
court
trying
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
for
instance.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
think
the
question
now
is
the
privilege
of
the
officer
which
is
a
defense
in
a
suit
for
a
personal
liability
whereas
the
question,
for
instance,
of
the
probable
cause
at
least
were
it
has
risen
for
the
most
part
has
been
in
whether
you
can
use
the
evidence
against
a
criminal
in
the
prosecution
and
i'm
not
they
are
the
same.
franky
i
wish
i
could
give
you
satisfactory
answer
to
that.
i
don't
think
i
can.
but
i
will
move
on
right
to
the
second
question
since
i
have
only
have
a
minute.
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
in
preliminary
papers
that
the
government
invoked
the
defense
of
governmental
privilege
in
the
district
court
as
well
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
even
urged
the
circuit
court
to
go
so
far
as
to
sustain
the
defense
in
the
face
of
clear
and
conscious
violation
of
the
constitution
and
they
cited
three
circuit
court
decisions
to
that
effect
which
i
noted
on
pages
20
and
21
on
my
brief.
now
that
the
issue
is
finally
in
front
of
this
court,
they
say
that
the
same
complaint
preliminary
papers
afford
insufficient
facts
to
--
for
an
informed
judgment.
obviously,
suggesting
that
on
remand
there
would
be
additional
facts
to
excuse
the
defendants.
i
think
clearly
problem
is
not
with
the
facts,
with
the
judgment.
it
has
to
be
reversed
and
reversed
by
this
court
because
it
has
arisen.
because
this
court's
pronouncement
since
following
its
(inaudible)
barr
v.
mateo
where
misapplied
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
norton
against
mcshane
to
shield
an
unconstitutional
arrest
and
detention.
the
first
circuit
has
already
rejected
the
norton
decision.
remanding
the
issue
here
to
the
second
circuit
will
simply
perpetuate
a
conflict
that
can
only
be
resolved
by
this
court.
and
so
the
position
of
the
petitioner
are
very
--
we
very
strongly
urge
that
this
issue
is
in
the
case
and
that
it
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
portion
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i'll
make
only
a
few
remarks
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
bench.
first,
when
you
ask
whether
--
if
state
law
governs
this
claim.
if
state
law
governs
this
claim,
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
we
are
out
of
the
court
if
mr.
feit
is
correct
in
saying
the
state
statute
of
limitations
bars
a
suit.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
because
i
think
we
brought
it
two
years
after
the
trespass
and
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
question
that
and
there
are
obviously,
others
issues
beside
the
damages
that
would
bear
on
the
federal
right.
what
is
required
here
is
not
as
the
government
so
strongly
suggests
creating
a
new
cause
of
action,
in
the
sense
of
defining
a
new
and
certainly
not
a
constitutional
tort.
here,
unlike
wheeldin
against
wheeler,
we
already
have
in
the
constitution
of
prescription
against
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
the
tort
of
trespass
is
as
old
any
of
common
law.
this
court
is
asked
to
hold
nothing
more
than
in
such
a
time
honored
claim
on
trespass
is
governed
by
federal
law
when
based
on
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
and
what
is
required
would
not,
again,
as
the
government
suggests,
freeze
fourth
amendment
remedies
in
a
mold
that
can
only
be
broken
by
a
constitutional
amendment.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not
redefining
the
fourth
amendment
but
about
its
enforcement
being
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
free
from
local
rules.
such
common
law
could
consistent
with
the
amendment
be
changed
by
legislative
action
and
even
if
the
right
to
damages
where
called
the
constitutional
right,
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
congress
from
acquiring
a
claim
to
be
asserted
against
the
government
itself
or
providing
for
indemnity
for
its
officers.
finally,
what
we
are
asking
would
not
has
worried
the
court
below,
lead
down
a
long
and
uncertain
road
in
creating
federal
rules
or
even
open
a
pandora's
box
of
civil
litigation
to
vindicate
constitutional
claims.
the
courts
and
particularly
the
federal
court's
responsibility
to
formulate
federal
rules
and
to
determine
the
difficult
question
which
constitutional
violations
give
rise
to
damage
claims
is
already
present
under
the
civil
rights
act.
recognizing
the
federal
nature
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
here
would
be,
if
the
courts
later
so
wished
an
easily
distinguished
decision
resting
as
it
must,
not
merely
on
the
face
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
on
the
specific
intent
of
the
framers
and
on
the
background
of
common
law
that
imposed
personal
liability.
in
concluding,
i
would
like
to
return
of
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
a
thought
that
i
suggested
at
the
beginning.
for
me
its
extra
ordinary
that
the
fundamental
questions
in
this
case
raised
with
this
court's
decision.
over
200
years
after,
they
were
settled
in
england
in
entick
against
carrington,
in
180
years
after
the
framers
attempted
to
incorporate
the
promise
of
entick
into
the
fourth
amendment
and
as
i
said,
25
years
after
this
court
so
pointedly
suggested
the
availability
of
a
federal
claim
and
bell
against
hood,
the
explanation,
as
the
courts
know
too
well,
does
not
lie
in
any
dearth
of
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
such
abuses
continue,
and
apparently
unabated
by
judicial
suppression
of
the
legally
seized
evidence.
obviously,
there
is
something
fundamentally
wrong
in
the
understanding
of
the
people
and
of
the
police
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
it
is
in
a
practical
sense
a
guarantee
that
can,
and
will
be
enforced.
if
there's
to
be
a
change,
it
will
not
come
from
simply
sustaining
the
right
to
sue
in
federal
court
and
as
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
the
civil
right
act
was
recognize
over
10
years
ago,
and
yet
the
use
of
the
civil
rights
act
remedy
has
been
minimal.
stronger
medicine
is
needed.
a
reaffirmation
of
the
citizens
right
under
federal
law
and
the
government's
liability
in
clear
and
resounding
terms
that
will
be
heard
and
understood
by
the
people
and
by
the
police
and
from
where
would
it
come.
from
a
congress
that
recently
authorized
no
knock
entry
by
the
police,
clearly
not.
it
will
be
from
this
court
or
not
at
all
and
looking
at
the
25
years
between
bell
against
hood
today,
it
would
now
a
very
possibly
never
or
no
time.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
this
court
would
hold
that
the
plaintiff
had
a
right
under
the
constitution
for
compensation
for
violation
of
fourth
amendment,
such
a
law,
i
believe
would
be
in
derogation
of
fourth
amendment,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
doesn't
have
considerable
flexibility.
as
i
pointed
out,
they
could
easily
adopt
a
bill
that
would
require
like
the
federal
torts
claim
act.
all
they
have
to
do
would
be
the
modify
it
so
that
the
suit
could
be
brought
against
the
government.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
would
certainly
differ
to
the
court's
judgment
but
that
would
be
my
position,
yes.
i
believe
it
would
be
in
derogation
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
such
a
statute.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that
is
precisely
why
i
insist
that
the
question
is
not
simply
jurisdictional
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
to
that
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that
would
be
fine,
the
suits
will
be
brought
in
the
state
courts,
but
the
point
is
that
the
law
in
the
state
courts
would
be
federal
law
and
it
would
be
subject
to
being
brought
up
to
this
court,
and
the
rules
hopefully
would
be
loud
and
clear
on
the
right
to
damages
for
all
kinds
of
suffering,
and
the
rule
on
the
defendant's
liability
would
be
equally
clear.
and
so,
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
vindicated
in
the
state
courts.
that
of
course
were
the
system
prior
to
1875
exactly
there.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
that
is
very
--
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
yes.
but
the
question
--
there
is
no
question
that
mapp
against
ohio
rested
very
strongly
on
the
inadequacy
of
other
remedies.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
i
think
that's
right
but
there
made
very
well
be
room
once
the
underpinning
of
the
inadequacy
of
civil
remedies
if
there
were
effective
civil
remedy
for
an
argument
that
it
is
essential
in
a
case
where
it
is
being
used
with
an
over
reaching
part
--
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
prosecute
the
defendant
and
in
that
type
of
case
maybe
it
is
certainly
an
essential
part
where
is
in
the
technical
case
where
there
is
no
over
reaching
no
authorization
from
higher
government
officers
then
perhaps,
once
the
other
basis
is
removed
the
question
should
be
reexamined.
mr.
stephen
a.
grant
it
certainly
might.
thank
you.
