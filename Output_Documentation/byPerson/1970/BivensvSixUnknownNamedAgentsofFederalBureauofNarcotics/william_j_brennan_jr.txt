j.
brennan,

is
there
a
cause
of
action
for
injunctive
relief
as
mr.
grant
suggested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
is
there
for
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
would
this
court
be
creating
a
cause
of
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question
mr.
feit.
if
there
is
already
a
cause
of
action
an
injunctive
relief
for
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
why
does
the
government
suggest
that
we
would
be
creating
a
cause
of
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
remedy
of
damages
for
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
two
are
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
left
in
the
state
law
under
your
submission.
it's
now
--
the
case
is
now
removed
to
the
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
now
most
of
the
important
elements
both
of
the
cause
of
action
and
the
defense
is
federal
law
of
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say
now
then
what's
left
for
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
type,
i
mean
as
between?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
difficult
is
you
--
government
apparently
concedes
so
much
--
so
many
the
issues
would
be
ruled
by
federal
law
but
something
you
tell
us
is
left
for
state
law
and
i
must
confess,
i
don't
follow
why
the
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
difference
is
it
going
to
make
in
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action?
you
have
now
conceded
that
he
has
one.
all
the
issues
are
governed
by
federal
law,
those
that
you
specified
assuming
they
all
result
favorably
to
the
plaintiff.
now,
where
is
he
as
between
state
law
and
federal
law
on
the
issue
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
extent
you
say
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
gather
it's
a
very
small?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
cause
of
action
for
injunctive
relief
