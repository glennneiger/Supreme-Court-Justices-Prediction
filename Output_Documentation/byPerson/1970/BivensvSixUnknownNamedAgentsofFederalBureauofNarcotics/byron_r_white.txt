justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
what's
involved
here
is
both
whether
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
and
what
the
applicable
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
state
law
would
govern,
if
the
federal
courts
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
in
other
words
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
still
could
be
held
that
there
is
not
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
with
that
in
the
state
court,
the
federal
law
would
govern?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standard
of
liability
would
you
suggest
the
court's
action
that
they
take
on
the
job
of
enforcing
fourth
amendment
directly?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
reasonably
believing
that
he
had
reasonable
--
that
he
had
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
he
was
quite
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
would
you
say,
if
the
state
court
entertained
a
suit
by
this
very
plaintiff
based
on
the
constitution
and
said
certainly
we'll
give
a
remedy
and
we
have
no
jurisdictional
problems
in
our
court
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
this
is
the
point.
the
point
is,
i'm
trying
to
ask
if
you
brought
a
suit
in
a
state
court
the
same
plaintiff
suing
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
state
court
said
certainly
we'll
entertain
an
action
to
enforce
the
fourth
amendment
against
the
officer
and
that
the
governing
law
would
be
federal
law
then,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
if
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
couldn't
that
--
a
state
court
--
it
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
court
to
say
to
this
plaintiff
you
seek
to
sue
under
the
fourth
amendment,
we
accept
the
suit
for
that
--
in
that
very
sense.
it
is
a
suit
under
the
fourth
amendment,
we're
going
enforced
fourth
amendment
in
this
suit,
a
state
court
couldn't
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
congress
had
pass
in
1983
and
keeping
it
on
the
books
all
these
years
turn
over
it
back
to
the
courts
the
task
of
fashioning
a
good
many
--
a
good
part
of
a
federal
law
of
constitutional
rights
against
state
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
left
a
–
left
it
very
open
ended
in
the
sense
that
all
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
all
of
the
internal
rules
and
standards
are
to
be
fashioned
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it,
you
don't
think
it's
odd
at
all
to
have
the
cases
against
state
officers
rest
on
federal
law
and
the
liability
of
federal
officers
rest
exclusively
on
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
on
your
position
the
law
applied
in
the
federal
court
will
be
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
it
can't
be
to
protect
the
federal
courts
because
you
suggest
that
all
the
cases
are
going
to
end
up
in
the
federal
court
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
you
think
you
could
go
into
a
state
court
or
federal
court
to
sue
a
federal
law
officer
for
having
broken
into
the
house
at
night
and
seized
a
bunch
of
drugs
and
asked
for
an
injunction
and
turned
it
over,
have
him
return
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
an
injunction,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
sue
the
federal
officer
to
get
the
property
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
replevin
action,
you
mean,
to
sue
to
get
the
property
back
in
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
of
course,
again,
that
question
when
we
remove
to
the
federal
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
state
law
would
govern
the
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
i
have
been
able
to
establish
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
it
might
lead
to
is
really
what
we
concerned
about
is
if
you
start
creating
federal
causes
of
actions
as
i
say,
they
maybe
constitutional
kinds
of
remedies
that
are
being
created.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
is
our
submission
that
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
governed
by
state
law
and
i
might
point
out
that
new
york
state
is
a
leader
in
compensatory
damage
recovery
for
alleged
invasions
--
in
mental
invasions
of
the
petitioners
or
claimants.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
would
be
very
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
if
this
case
were
filed
in
the
state
court,
removed
to
the
federal
court
and
we
tried
out
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
think
congress
could
instead
of
putting
it
that
way
say
the
federal
court
should
have
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
suits
against
federal
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
answering
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
congress
didn't
put
it
the
way
you,
mr.
justice
black
put
it
to
you
but
just
said
that
federal
court
shall
have
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
any
cases
against
federal
officer?
