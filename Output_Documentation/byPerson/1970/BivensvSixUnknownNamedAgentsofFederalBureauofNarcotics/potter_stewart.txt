justice
potter
stewart
he's
subject
to
good
faith
with
this
sufficient
defense
for
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
the
same
test
as
would
make
a
search
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
now
whether
it
would
be
in
logic
and
in
theory,
should
it
be
the
--
you
used
the
word
reasonableness
and
that's
the
same
word,
form
of
the
same
word
that
the
united
states
constitution
uses
that
makes
a
search
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
erie
railroad.
it's
not
erie
railroad
because
this
is
not
a
diversity
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
i
missed
somewhere
along
the
line
is,
why
do
you
say
that
state
law
would
be
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
would
be,
would
be?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
assuming
what
kind
of
a
cause
of
action
for
trespass?
justice
potter
stewart
for
possibly
replevin
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested?
justice
potter
stewart
if
wanted
the
property
back?
justice
potter
stewart
the
$2
million
worth
of
whatever
contraband,
you
want
that
back?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
you
sued
in
the
state
court
simply
for
a
violation
of
your
fourth
amendment
rights
in
the
state
and
that
particular
state
said,
that's
fine,
we
have
tort
remedy
for
that.
we
are
under
the
constitution
of
united
states,
around
here
in
the
state
and
we
give
a
tort
remedy
for
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
that's
removed
to
federal
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
you
have
an
action
then
in
the
federal
court
removable
only
because
the
defendant
is
a
federal
officer
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
the
difference
then
between
the
what
have
then
and
what
the
petitioner
alleges
you
have
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
cause
of
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
damages
based
upon
rights
that
are
accorded
to
you
under
the
constitution.
now,
you
might
have
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
based
upon
rights
that
are
accorded
upon
you
by
the
common
law
of
negligence,
if
you
are
hit
by
an
automobile.
it
doesn't
mean
it's
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
another
case,
isn't
it
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
remedy
asked
for
here,
money
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
certainly
not
a
very
unusual
remedy,
is
it?
it's
nothing
that
takes
a
great
deal
of
craftsmanship
or
creativity
to
understand
the
cause
of
action
for
money
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
statute
limitations,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
could
congress
repeal
the
exclusionary
rule?
i
guess
not
after
mapp
against
ohio
which
held
that
it
is
part
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
rested
as
--
part
of
the
rest
on
finding
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
part
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
which
was
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
if
you
prevail
here
the
logic
of
progressive
events
might
lead
the
court
to
be
invited
to
reconsider
the
--
at
least
the
full
force
of
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
subject
to
good
faith
with
this
sufficient
defense
for
