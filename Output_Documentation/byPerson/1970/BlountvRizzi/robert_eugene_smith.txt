mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
factual
circumstances
in
the
case
involving
the
book
bin
are
slightly
different
than
the
factual
circumstances
involved
in
the
mailbox.
and
as
to
those
differences
and
as
not
covered
by
my
brother
here,
i
would
like
to
make
mention
of
those
facts.
first
if
it
please
the
court,
a
particular
publication
is
involved
--
the
particular
publication
involved
is
just
one,
it's
called
models
de
france.
the
advertising
brochure
sent
out
to
a
postal
inspector,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
on
page
58
and
59
of
the
appendix,
has
a
notation
at
the
top
right
hand
corner
and
the
date
2/4/69,
february
4,
1969.
now,
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
what
thereafter
occurred
is
nothing
for
four
months.
and
then
in
june,
approximately
june
6,
a
motion
is
filed
--
a
petition
is
filed,
to
complain
before
the
judicial
hearing
officer
as
well
as
a
motion
for
expedited
hearing
because
of
the
tremendous
danger
suggested
in
this
particular
regard.
and
then
almost
instantaneously,
a
motion
is
made
under
4007
to
have
the
court
declare
a
probable
cause
that
this
material
is
obscene.
but
yet
four
months
went
by
under
the
scheme
as
it
operated
by
the
government's
own
exhibit
as
put
into
this
particular
case.
and,
we
point
out
to
the
court,
the
material,
the
magazine
models
de
france
which
in
19
--
which
was
the
subject
of
the
1969
proceedings
was
no
more
candid
than
the
magazine
that
this
court
found
not
obscene
applying
the
redrup
concept
in
exclusive
in
the
magazine
case
involving
exclusive
or
titled
central
magazine
sales
versus
united
sates
in
october
of
1967.
so
this
is
two
--
almost
two
years
later
--
a
year-and-a-half-later,
there
is
an
attempt
to
take
one
magazine
out
of
an
entire
brochure
and
we
suggest
that
these
are
separate
factual
circumstances.
in
this
particular
context,
what
occurred
is
a
us
attorney
sent
a
letter
to
the
book
bin,
telling
them
that
he
was
going
to
move
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
counsel
appeared
at
the
time
and
shortly
thereafter
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
application
as
well
as
asking
for
a
three-judge
court
to
declare
the
constitutionality.
it
is
true
in
this
case,
there
was
no
time
any
mail
stopped
because
of
the
action
of
counsel
in
this
particular
regard.
and
in
that
context,
we
say
this
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
case.
now,
we
divide
our
argument
into
several
parts.
first
is
the
concept
of
whether
the
administrative
proceedings
here
are
appropriate
under
the
first
amendment,
dealing
with
presumably
protected
publications.
we
have,
as
we
suggested,
a
post
office
proceeding
that
does
not
have
an
adversary
concept
before
a
judicial
officer,
a
court,
that
what
occurs
is
that
the
publication
is
displayed
and
an
affidavit
is
obtained
by
the
general
counsel,
the
materials
are
then
submitted
to
the
hearing
examiner
who
then
dockets
a
complaint
and
goes
forward
from
there.
now,
in
this
instance,
there
is
no
expertise
suggested
in
this
hearing
officer
as
you've
heard,
80%
of
his
time
is
spent
in
matters
relating
to
contracts
for
post
office
buildings
that
the
proceedings
at
that
time,
there's
no
time
period
within
which
the
hearing
must
be
convened.
there
is
no
time
period
as
we
would
suggest
is
required
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
title
film
corporation
and
in
freedman
within
which
there
must
be
a
prompt
judicial
determination
and
we
say
that
in
this
regard,
this
is
a
failure
in
this
context.
then
there
is
no
obviously
no
jury
in
the
context
of
the
administrative
proceedings
that
can
determine
whether
or
not
something
is
or
is
not
obscene.
and
we
suggest
the
publications
in
the
mailbox
case
were
determined
by
that
same
hearing
--
acting
judicial
officer
to
be
obscene
as
mr.
fleishman
indicated
counsel
that
these
were
comparable
to
the
materials
in
bloss
and
we
suggest
they
were
also
comparable
to
the
materials
in
the
central
magazine
case.
so
in
that
particular
context,
we
say
that
they
are
not
--
these
are
not
appropriate
procedures.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
a
4007
order,
we
suggest
that
there
are
several
deficiencies
in
that
particular
section
which
are
special
to
the
book
bin
case.
first
is
what
is
probable
cause
or
what
is
the
probable
cause
test?
there
is
no
guide
left
as
to
what
is
the
probable
cause
in
the
context
of
a
4007
hearing
because
in
that
instance,
are
we
talking
about
an
opportunity
--
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard?
is
one
day
or
two
days
sufficient?
this
is
not
a
kind
of
situation
like
carroll
versus
president
and
commissioners
of
princess
anne
county
wherein
a
speech
was
about
to
be
heard
that
almost
the
next
evening
or
that
evening
and
that
there
was
emergency
concepts
involved
and
there
was
no
opportunity
--
there
could've
been
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
an
immediate
hearing
could've
been
held.
in
this
context,
they
waited
as
we
suggested
from
february
until
june
and
then
they
moved
for
an
immediate
hearing
and
we
say
that
unlike
carroll
versus
president
and
commissioners
of
princess
anne
county,
there
was
no
overriding
emergency
and
in
this
regard
what
is
probable
cause
consistent
with
due
process?
is
it
one
or
two
days
notice
to
go
in
and
be
prepared
to
demonstrate
one's
case?
in
this
particular
regard,
we
also
go
on
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reasonable
construction
that
could
obtain
to
save
what
we
consider
to
be
an
unconstitutional
mail
block
requiring
an
affirmative
action
on
the
part
of
the
addressee
under
the
doctrine
suggested
by
this
court
in
lamont.
the
order,
yes,
suggested
could
be
drawn
very
narrowly
and
that
a
postal
inspector
could
be
delegated
to
sit
down
with
the
addressee
on
a
day
by
day
basis,
sort
through
every
piece
of
mail
there
to
determine
whether
any
of
the
material
alleged
to
be
obscene
could
be
determined
--
could
be
released
to
them
and
only
that
material
which
was
not
would
be
released.
so,
we
suggest
that
this
in
effect
creates
a
chilling
effect
or
self
censorship
which
we
feel
this
court
has
condemned
on
numerous
and
prior
occasions
that
the
trial
court
or
the
three-judge
court
suggests
that
under
the
broad
wording
of
the
statute,
that
under
a
4770
order
that
the
united
states
could
obtain
a
court
order
detaining
all
incoming
mail.
however,
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
could
be
somewhat
reduced.
we
get
in
part
two
the
concept
that
this
court,
as
mr.
fleishman
has
discussed,
mr.
strauss
has
discussed
with
respect
to
roth
and
its
applicability
in
this
regard.
we
are
--
in
essence,
we
say
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
receive
material
which
to
him
is
for
his
amusement
value
or
for
the
conveyance
of
ideological
content.
the
individual
asserts
that
right
by
ordering
merchandise.
now,
it
is
not
suggested,
we
say
that
this
brochure
necessarily
goes
to
an
unwilling
or
to
an
unsolicited
individual
and
he
then
responds
by
ordering
a
magazine.
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
that
this
man
can
get
on
the
mailing
list
so
to
speak.
he
can
buy
a
publication
that
is
put
out
by
a
firm.
he
may
have
an
advertisement
in
there
and
he
may
write
and
say
“send
me
your
brochure”
and
the
brochure
is
send
in
response
to
this
and
in
kind
than
the
publication
is
sent
to
him
after
he
orders
from
the
brochure.
and
this
is
in
effect
the
part
of
the
people
like
the
book
bin
or
the
mailbox
trying
to
follow
what
is
suggested
or
what
has
been
suggested
by
this
court
in
the
treatment
of
the
redrup
cases.
whereas
are
we
dealing
with
an
individual
who
wants
to
avoid
exposure
to
adult
type
materials
and
if
this
is
the
unsolicited
intrusive
mailing.
but
if
john
doe,
postal
inspector
wants
to
go
in
a
mailbox
list
and
he
wants
to
buy
adult
type
of
material
from
the
mailbox
and
ultimately
as
this
court
recognized
in
rowan,
there
is
an
exchange
of
list
in
every
commercial
enterprise
in
mail
order
that
if
ultimately,
what
occurs
is
that
this
list
is
exchanged
and
he
then
gets
an
advertisement
from
the
book
bin
or
whatever.
he
is
not
in
the
category
of
the
individual
who
says
“i
wanted
to
avoid
confrontation
with
this
kind
of
material.”
he
is
not
that
particular
person.
so
we're
not
--
it's
not
a
solicitation.
it's
just
sent
out
widespread
which
seems
to
us
to
have
been
suggested
in
the
stanley
case
when
the
court
took
particular
pains
as
this
counsel
reads
it,
to
point
out
in
a
footnote
a
quotation
from
the
various
cases
and
said,
“the
court
found
it”
--
this
is
on
page
548
of
the
lawyer's
edition,
“the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions
presented
by
the
claimant,
but
did
notice
the
belief
that
the
statement
in
roth
concerning
the
rejection
of
obscenity
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
widespread
distribution
of
the
material
in
roth.”
and
again
later
in
the
particular
case,
this
court
--
in
the
stanley
case,
this
court
has
reiterated
what
it
was
said
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
roth,
the
door
barring
federal
and
state
intrusions,
this
area
cannot
be
left
ajar.
it
must
be
kept
tightly
closed
and
open
to
slightest
crack
necessary
to
prevent
encroachment
upon
more
important
interest.
and
at
that
particular
point,
there
was
a
footnote
which
led
us
back
ultimately
to
breard
versus
city
of
alexandria
would
seem
to
be
an
expression
of
the
kind
of
intrusion
that
we
were
talking
about.
that
certain
material
could
be
disseminated.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
in
ginsburg
versus
u.s.
that
unless
the
material
is
hardcore,
certainly
there
should
be
some
intrusive
quality
about
the
nature
of
it's
dissemination
before
it
should
be
prohibited,
at
least
that's
as
this
counsel
has
read
the
particular
point.
so
we're
not
--
we're
in
this
particular
position
that
we
are
not
engaged
in
a
widespread
indiscriminate
circulation.
we
have
an
individual
who
by
one
form
or
the
other
has
gotten
onto
a
mailing
list,
who
was
indicated
by
his
prior
correspondence
or
such
that
he
wants
to
receive
adult
type
material.
the
characterization
by
mr.
strauss
as
this
being,
you
know,
that
these
people
are
in
a
particular
industry
or
they're
involved
with
the
monetary
aspect,
everyone
is
involved
in
the
monetary
aspect.
in
this
regard,
these
people
have
suggested
they
want
to
receive
something.
they
want
to
order.
they
write
to
the
book
bin
to
get
it.
the
post
office
department
comes
in
and
decides
that
they
shouldn't
get
it
for
one
reason
or
the
other
a
particular
publication
which
was
known
to
them
to
be
at
least
comparable
to
the
material
before
this
court
in
the
exclusive
case,
not
even
as
candid
as
the
material
in
the
bloss
case,
later
determined
by
this
court
i
think
on
june
1,
197
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that
particular
point.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
there
was
no
factual
inquiry
conducted
by
the
court
in
reaching
the
question
in
the
abstract
your
honor.
but
i
was
answering
as
i
thought
mr.
justice
blackmun's
questions
earlier
regarding
the
manner
of
how
someone
might
get
this
and
how
someone
may
respond
to
it
in
this
particular
regard.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor
that
is
correct.
the
court
did
not
get
into
the
application
of
the
law
in
this
particular
context
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
reluctantly
admit
that
is
correct.
and
we
suggest
that
it's
not
just
freedman,
we
suggest
also
it's
a
lamont
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
those
two
factors
are
the
factors
that
we
concern
ourselves
with.
the
burden
for
instituting
judicial
review
at
the
conclusion
of
a
post
office
determination
is
on
the
addressee.
the
burden
is
on
the
censor.
this
we
suggest
is
in
violation
of
freedman.
there
is
no
time
period
within
which
this
administrative
process
must
be
concluded.
we
say
--
we
suggest
that
that
is
in
violation
of
the
title
film
corporation
which
was
in
essence
bottomed
on
freedman
versus
maryland,
that
the
burden
of
carrying
persuasion
certainly
by
virtue
of
an
administrative
determination
of
obscenity
would
then
be
on
the
person
seeking
to
reverse
or
change
that
particular
thing
in
the
judicial
review.
and
we
say
that
these
things
are
inaccurate.
and
as
to
4007,
there
is
no
standard
as
to
determination
of
what
probable
cause
is
and
the
probable
cause
issue,
once
the
court
finds
probable
cause
whether
it's
to
the
--
under
any
standard
could
something
be
said
to
be
obscene
under
any
test
could
something
be
said
to
be
obscene.
if
the
court
follows
that
as
to
the
issue
of
probable
cause,
then
we
have
something
tied
up,
we
have
correspondence
tied
up,
we
have
obviously
a
chilling
effect
we
suggest
your
honor
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
freedom
and
it
is
the
public
that
in
great
measure
is
deprived.
there
is
in
this
instance,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
particular
exhibit
quoting
in
this
publication
on
page
58
and
59
of
the
appendix,
the
material
in
models
de
france,
the
publication
on
the
cover
is
indistinguishable
from
any
of
the
other
material.
so
what
we
have
is
an
invidious
one
magazine
proposition.
we're
coming
in
one
magazine
and
we're
going
to
do
it
on
one
magazine.
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
stop
there
and
we
suggest
that
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
that
there
has
to
be
as
this
court
has
said
so
many
times
a
very
strict
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that's
correct
but--i
don't
get
your
point.
are
you
saying
they
singled
you
out
for
some
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
i'm
not
saying
they
singled
us
out.
they
singled
a
publication
out
that
this
was
a
pilot
procedure
we
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
court
undertook
--
the
post
office
department
undertook
in
two
different
jurisdictions.
one
in
california
and
one
in
atlanta,
georgia
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
oh!
no
sir.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
government
can
argue
today
one
magazine
is
all
that's
involved
and
all
of
those
publications.
we
say
that
if
this
procedure
is
allowed
to
go
on
unchecked
as
it
is
presently
constituted
that
it
is
the
beginning
of
and
could
be
the
beginning
of
and
could
have
deleterious
results
upon
again
the
public's
right
to
receive
access
to
material
which
is
in
this
instance
certainly
not
hardcore
pornography
by
any
definition
that
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
and
times
gone
by
and
as
been
set
out
in
the
margin
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
ginsburg
versus
us
dissent.
so
we
say
that
as
to
the
lamont
issue,
we
feel
it
controls
as
written
and
we
feel
certainly
that
the
freedman
factors
as
argued
control
as
written.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
factual
circumstances
in
the
case
involving
the
book
bin
are
slightly
different
than
the
factual
circumstances
involved
in
the
mailbox.
and
as
to
those
differences
and
as
not
covered
by
my
brother
here,
i
would
like
to
make
mention
of
those
facts.
first
if
it
please
the
court,
a
particular
publication
is
involved
--
the
particular
publication
involved
is
just
one,
it's
called
models
de
france.
the
advertising
brochure
sent
out
to
a
postal
inspector,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
on
page
58
and
59
of
the
appendix,
has
a
notation
at
the
top
right
hand
corner
and
the
date
2/4/69,
february
4,
1969.
now,
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
what
thereafter
occurred
is
nothing
for
four
months.
and
then
in
june,
approximately
june
6,
a
motion
is
filed
--
a
petition
is
filed,
to
complain
before
the
judicial
hearing
officer
as
well
as
a
motion
for
expedited
hearing
because
of
the
tremendous
danger
suggested
in
this
particular
regard.
and
then
almost
instantaneously,
a
motion
is
made
under
4007
to
have
the
court
declare
a
probable
cause
that
this
material
is
obscene.
but
yet
four
months
went
by
under
the
scheme
as
it
operated
by
the
government's
own
exhibit
as
put
into
this
particular
case.
and,
we
point
out
to
the
court,
the
material,
the
magazine
models
de
france
which
in
19
--
which
was
the
subject
of
the
1969
proceedings
was
no
more
candid
than
the
magazine
that
this
court
found
not
obscene
applying
the
redrup
concept
in
exclusive
in
the
magazine
case
involving
exclusive
or
titled
central
magazine
sales
versus
united
sates
in
october
of
1967.
so
this
is
two
--
almost
two
years
later
--
a
year-and-a-half-later,
there
is
an
attempt
to
take
one
magazine
out
of
an
entire
brochure
and
we
suggest
that
these
are
separate
factual
circumstances.
in
this
particular
context,
what
occurred
is
a
us
attorney
sent
a
letter
to
the
book
bin,
telling
them
that
he
was
going
to
move
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
counsel
appeared
at
the
time
and
shortly
thereafter
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
application
as
well
as
asking
for
a
three-judge
court
to
declare
the
constitutionality.
it
is
true
in
this
case,
there
was
no
time
any
mail
stopped
because
of
the
action
of
counsel
in
this
particular
regard.
and
in
that
context,
we
say
this
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
case.
now,
we
divide
our
argument
into
several
parts.
first
is
the
concept
of
whether
the
administrative
proceedings
here
are
appropriate
under
the
first
amendment,
dealing
with
presumably
protected
publications.
we
have,
as
we
suggested,
a
post
office
proceeding
that
does
not
have
an
adversary
concept
before
a
judicial
officer,
a
court,
that
what
occurs
is
that
the
publication
is
displayed
and
an
affidavit
is
obtained
by
the
general
counsel,
the
materials
are
then
submitted
to
the
hearing
examiner
who
then
dockets
a
complaint
and
goes
forward
from
there.
now,
in
this
instance,
there
is
no
expertise
suggested
in
this
hearing
officer
as
you've
heard,
80%
of
his
time
is
spent
in
matters
relating
to
contracts
for
post
office
buildings
that
the
proceedings
at
that
time,
there's
no
time
period
within
which
the
hearing
must
be
convened.
there
is
no
time
period
as
we
would
suggest
is
required
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
title
film
corporation
and
in
freedman
within
which
there
must
be
a
prompt
judicial
determination
and
we
say
that
in
this
regard,
this
is
a
failure
in
this
context.
then
there
is
no
obviously
no
jury
in
the
context
of
the
administrative
proceedings
that
can
determine
whether
or
not
something
is
or
is
not
obscene.
and
we
suggest
the
publications
in
the
mailbox
case
were
determined
by
that
same
hearing
--
acting
judicial
officer
to
be
obscene
as
mr.
fleishman
indicated
counsel
that
these
were
comparable
to
the
materials
in
bloss
and
we
suggest
they
were
also
comparable
to
the
materials
in
the
central
magazine
case.
so
in
that
particular
context,
we
say
that
they
are
not
--
these
are
not
appropriate
procedures.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
a
4007
order,
we
suggest
that
there
are
several
deficiencies
in
that
particular
section
which
are
special
to
the
book
bin
case.
first
is
what
is
probable
cause
or
what
is
the
probable
cause
test?
there
is
no
guide
left
as
to
what
is
the
probable
cause
in
the
context
of
a
4007
hearing
because
in
that
instance,
are
we
talking
about
an
opportunity
--
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard?
is
one
day
or
two
days
sufficient?
this
is
not
a
kind
of
situation
like
carroll
versus
president
and
commissioners
of
princess
anne
county
wherein
a
speech
was
about
to
be
heard
that
almost
the
next
evening
or
that
evening
and
that
there
was
emergency
concepts
involved
and
there
was
no
opportunity
--
there
could've
been
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
an
immediate
hearing
could've
been
held.
in
this
context,
they
waited
as
we
suggested
from
february
until
june
and
then
they
moved
for
an
immediate
hearing
and
we
say
that
unlike
carroll
versus
president
and
commissioners
of
princess
anne
county,
there
was
no
overriding
emergency
and
in
this
regard
what
is
probable
cause
consistent
with
due
process?
is
it
one
or
two
days
notice
to
go
in
and
be
prepared
to
demonstrate
one's
case?
in
this
particular
regard,
we
also
go
on
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reasonable
construction
that
could
obtain
to
save
what
we
consider
to
be
an
unconstitutional
mail
block
requiring
an
affirmative
action
on
the
part
of
the
addressee
under
the
doctrine
suggested
by
this
court
in
lamont.
the
order,
yes,
suggested
could
be
drawn
very
narrowly
and
that
a
postal
inspector
could
be
delegated
to
sit
down
with
the
addressee
on
a
day
by
day
basis,
sort
through
every
piece
of
mail
there
to
determine
whether
any
of
the
material
alleged
to
be
obscene
could
be
determined
--
could
be
released
to
them
and
only
that
material
which
was
not
would
be
released.
so,
we
suggest
that
this
in
effect
creates
a
chilling
effect
or
self
censorship
which
we
feel
this
court
has
condemned
on
numerous
and
prior
occasions
that
the
trial
court
or
the
three-judge
court
suggests
that
under
the
broad
wording
of
the
statute,
that
under
a
4770
order
that
the
united
states
could
obtain
a
court
order
detaining
all
incoming
mail.
however,
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
could
be
somewhat
reduced.
we
get
in
part
two
the
concept
that
this
court,
as
mr.
fleishman
has
discussed,
mr.
strauss
has
discussed
with
respect
to
roth
and
its
applicability
in
this
regard.
we
are
--
in
essence,
we
say
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
receive
material
which
to
him
is
for
his
amusement
value
or
for
the
conveyance
of
ideological
content.
the
individual
asserts
that
right
by
ordering
merchandise.
now,
it
is
not
suggested,
we
say
that
this
brochure
necessarily
goes
to
an
unwilling
or
to
an
unsolicited
individual
and
he
then
responds
by
ordering
a
magazine.
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
that
this
man
can
get
on
the
mailing
list
so
to
speak.
he
can
buy
a
publication
that
is
put
out
by
a
firm.
he
may
have
an
advertisement
in
there
and
he
may
write
and
say
“send
me
your
brochure”
and
the
brochure
is
send
in
response
to
this
and
in
kind
than
the
publication
is
sent
to
him
after
he
orders
from
the
brochure.
and
this
is
in
effect
the
part
of
the
people
like
the
book
bin
or
the
mailbox
trying
to
follow
what
is
suggested
or
what
has
been
suggested
by
this
court
in
the
treatment
of
the
redrup
cases.
whereas
are
we
dealing
with
an
individual
who
wants
to
avoid
exposure
to
adult
type
materials
and
if
this
is
the
unsolicited
intrusive
mailing.
but
if
john
doe,
postal
inspector
wants
to
go
in
a
mailbox
list
and
he
wants
to
buy
adult
type
of
material
from
the
mailbox
and
ultimately
as
this
court
recognized
in
rowan,
there
is
an
exchange
of
list
in
every
commercial
enterprise
in
mail
order
that
if
ultimately,
what
occurs
is
that
this
list
is
exchanged
and
he
then
gets
an
advertisement
from
the
book
bin
or
whatever.
he
is
not
in
the
category
of
the
individual
who
says
“i
wanted
to
avoid
confrontation
with
this
kind
of
material.”
he
is
not
that
particular
person.
so
we're
not
--
it's
not
a
solicitation.
it's
just
sent
out
widespread
which
seems
to
us
to
have
been
suggested
in
the
stanley
case
when
the
court
took
particular
pains
as
this
counsel
reads
it,
to
point
out
in
a
footnote
a
quotation
from
the
various
cases
and
said,
“the
court
found
it”
--
this
is
on
page
548
of
the
lawyer's
edition,
“the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions
presented
by
the
claimant,
but
did
notice
the
belief
that
the
statement
in
roth
concerning
the
rejection
of
obscenity
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
widespread
distribution
of
the
material
in
roth.”
and
again
later
in
the
particular
case,
this
court
--
in
the
stanley
case,
this
court
has
reiterated
what
it
was
said
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
roth,
the
door
barring
federal
and
state
intrusions,
this
area
cannot
be
left
ajar.
it
must
be
kept
tightly
closed
and
open
to
slightest
crack
necessary
to
prevent
encroachment
upon
more
important
interest.
and
at
that
particular
point,
there
was
a
footnote
which
led
us
back
ultimately
to
breard
versus
city
of
alexandria
would
seem
to
be
an
expression
of
the
kind
of
intrusion
that
we
were
talking
about.
that
certain
material
could
be
disseminated.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
in
ginsburg
versus
u.s.
that
unless
the
material
is
hardcore,
certainly
there
should
be
some
intrusive
quality
about
the
nature
of
it's
dissemination
before
it
should
be
prohibited,
at
least
that's
as
this
counsel
has
read
the
particular
point.
so
we're
not
--
we're
in
this
particular
position
that
we
are
not
engaged
in
a
widespread
indiscriminate
circulation.
we
have
an
individual
who
by
one
form
or
the
other
has
gotten
onto
a
mailing
list,
who
was
indicated
by
his
prior
correspondence
or
such
that
he
wants
to
receive
adult
type
material.
the
characterization
by
mr.
strauss
as
this
being,
you
know,
that
these
people
are
in
a
particular
industry
or
they're
involved
with
the
monetary
aspect,
everyone
is
involved
in
the
monetary
aspect.
in
this
regard,
these
people
have
suggested
they
want
to
receive
something.
they
want
to
order.
they
write
to
the
book
bin
to
get
it.
the
post
office
department
comes
in
and
decides
that
they
shouldn't
get
it
for
one
reason
or
the
other
a
particular
publication
which
was
known
to
them
to
be
at
least
comparable
to
the
material
before
this
court
in
the
exclusive
case,
not
even
as
candid
as
the
material
in
the
bloss
case,
later
determined
by
this
court
i
think
on
june
1,
197
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that
particular
point.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
there
was
no
factual
inquiry
conducted
by
the
court
in
reaching
the
question
in
the
abstract
your
honor.
but
i
was
answering
as
i
thought
mr.
justice
blackmun's
questions
earlier
regarding
the
manner
of
how
someone
might
get
this
and
how
someone
may
respond
to
it
in
this
particular
regard.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor
that
is
correct.
the
court
did
not
get
into
the
application
of
the
law
in
this
particular
context
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
i
reluctantly
admit
that
is
correct.
and
we
suggest
that
it's
not
just
freedman,
we
suggest
also
it's
a
lamont
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
those
two
factors
are
the
factors
that
we
concern
ourselves
with.
the
burden
for
instituting
judicial
review
at
the
conclusion
of
a
post
office
determination
is
on
the
addressee.
the
burden
is
on
the
censor.
this
we
suggest
is
in
violation
of
freedman.
there
is
no
time
period
within
which
this
administrative
process
must
be
concluded.
we
say
--
we
suggest
that
that
is
in
violation
of
the
title
film
corporation
which
was
in
essence
bottomed
on
freedman
versus
maryland,
that
the
burden
of
carrying
persuasion
certainly
by
virtue
of
an
administrative
determination
of
obscenity
would
then
be
on
the
person
seeking
to
reverse
or
change
that
particular
thing
in
the
judicial
review.
and
we
say
that
these
things
are
inaccurate.
and
as
to
4007,
there
is
no
standard
as
to
determination
of
what
probable
cause
is
and
the
probable
cause
issue,
once
the
court
finds
probable
cause
whether
it's
to
the
--
under
any
standard
could
something
be
said
to
be
obscene
under
any
test
could
something
be
said
to
be
obscene.
if
the
court
follows
that
as
to
the
issue
of
probable
cause,
then
we
have
something
tied
up,
we
have
correspondence
tied
up,
we
have
obviously
a
chilling
effect
we
suggest
your
honor
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
freedom
and
it
is
the
public
that
in
great
measure
is
deprived.
there
is
in
this
instance,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
particular
exhibit
quoting
in
this
publication
on
page
58
and
59
of
the
appendix,
the
material
in
models
de
france,
the
publication
on
the
cover
is
indistinguishable
from
any
of
the
other
material.
so
what
we
have
is
an
invidious
one
magazine
proposition.
we're
coming
in
one
magazine
and
we're
going
to
do
it
on
one
magazine.
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
stop
there
and
we
suggest
that
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
that
there
has
to
be
as
this
court
has
said
so
many
times
a
very
strict
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that's
correct
but--i
don't
get
your
point.
are
you
saying
they
singled
you
out
for
some
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
i'm
not
saying
they
singled
us
out.
they
singled
a
publication
out
that
this
was
a
pilot
procedure
we
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
court
undertook
--
the
post
office
department
undertook
in
two
different
jurisdictions.
one
in
california
and
one
in
atlanta,
georgia
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
oh!
no
sir.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
government
can
argue
today
one
magazine
is
all
that's
involved
and
all
of
those
publications.
we
say
that
if
this
procedure
is
allowed
to
go
on
unchecked
as
it
is
presently
constituted
that
it
is
the
beginning
of
and
could
be
the
beginning
of
and
could
have
deleterious
results
upon
again
the
public's
right
to
receive
access
to
material
which
is
in
this
instance
certainly
not
hardcore
pornography
by
any
definition
that
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
and
times
gone
by
and
as
been
set
out
in
the
margin
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
ginsburg
versus
us
dissent.
so
we
say
that
as
to
the
lamont
issue,
we
feel
it
controls
as
written
and
we
feel
certainly
that
the
freedman
factors
as
argued
control
as
written.
thank
you.
