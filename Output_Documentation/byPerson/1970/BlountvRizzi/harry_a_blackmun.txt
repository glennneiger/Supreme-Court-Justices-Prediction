a.
blackmun
i
take
it
then,
you
feel
that
if
an
affirmance
comes
along
here,
then
section
4005
and
the
integrity
of
the
donaldson
holding
are
both
placed
in
jeopardy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
strauss,
you
mentioned
just
now
burden
on
the
other
party.
as
i
read
the
decisions
below,
each
of
them
place
great
emphasis
on
the
burden
aspect
of
the
case.
do
you
wish
to
come
out
any
further
on
that?
do
i
correctly
interpret
your
remark
to
mean
that
you
feel
there
is
no
burden
of
any
consequence
in
this
administrative
procedure
that
is
placed
upon
the
advertiser
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
doesn’t
your
brochure
itself
contain
the
very
material
which
the
publications
you
are
trying
to
sell
contain?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
suppose
your
brochure
did
contain
some
sample
pictures,
and
then
is
your
case
different?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
fleishman
let
me
ask
you
what
i
asked
mr.
strauss.
if
you
prevail
here
is
in
the
integrity
of
the
donaldson
decision
in
any
way
affected
in
your
view?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
feel
there
is
a
distinction
between
fraud
in
the
one
hand
and
obscenity
on
the
other
if
i
over
simplify?
