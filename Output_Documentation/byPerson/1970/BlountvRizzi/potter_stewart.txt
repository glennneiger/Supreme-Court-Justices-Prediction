stewart
when
was
this
particular
statute
first
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
i
misunderstood
you
then,
i
thought
you
said
this
was
second
and
fourth
class
mail?
justice
potter
stewart
this
doesn’t
it
--
this
case
involves
what,
the
second
and
fourth
class
mail?
justice
potter
stewart
first
class
mail?
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
they
get
the
owner
blank?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it’s
fair
to
say
mr.
fleishman
that
the
lockhart
commission
was
dealing
with
questions
of
policy
and
not
with
where
it
matters
of
constitutional
law.
i
haven't
read
the
report,
but
i
have
only
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
the
commission
itself
purport
to
becoming
to
reaching
the
constitutional
decisions
that
is
decisions
of
constitutional
law?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
recommending
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
the
construction
--
the
alternative
construction
of
the
statue
that
the
government
suggests
on
pages
26
and
27
of
government’s
brief
would
serve
to
eliminate
at
least
the
freedman
objections
to
in
your
submissions
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
unless
they
did
there
would
be
no
impounding.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
pretty
much
governed
by
lamont,
i
should
think
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
after
the
final
administrative
order
and
before
the
appeal
during
that
period?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
--
it's
your
alternative
--
your
talking
about
your
alternative
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
whole
purpose
of
it
was
that
as
i
understand
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
stop
matters
during
the
time
necessary
for
the
administrative
procedures
to
present
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
that
too
is
appealable?
justice
potter
stewart
the
interference
with
incoming
mail,
with
who's
incoming
mail?
you're
talking
about
the
target
of
these
proceedings
or
the
--
justice

stewart
--or
the
incoming
mail
of
the
members
of
the
public
who
send
the
order
for
this
material?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
it
prevents
the
members
of
the
public
who
order
this
material
from
getting
it
and
to
that
extent,
it
interferes
with
their
incoming

justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
that
mr.
strauss,
i
don't
want
to
slow
you
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
why
shouldn't
we
consider
this
as
the
way
the
department
would
ordinarily
proceed
under
the
statute?
what
did
it
do,
it
shouldn't
have
done?
justice
potter

you're
talking
about
the
nature
of
the
--
