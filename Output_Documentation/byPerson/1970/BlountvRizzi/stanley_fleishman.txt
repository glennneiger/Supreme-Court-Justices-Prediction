mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
court
please,
this
case
started
when
a
postal
inspector
inspector
representing
himself
as
being
over
21
years
of
age,
ordered
seven
magazines
which
he
said
he
wanted.
thereafter,
the
post
office
started
the
administrative
proceedings
that
were
discussed
by
mr.
strauss
and
had
the
order.
the
effect
of
which
was
to
keep
every
adult
person
in
america
who
made
similarly,
have
wanted
to
order
these
magazines
from
getting
these
magazines.
it
also
had
the
effect
of
invading
the
privacy
of
the
mail
because
persons
who
sent
first
class
mail
to
appellee
had
their
mail
poked
over
by
post
office
persons
in
the
office
there
to
see
whether
this
was
mailed
that
“could
or
should”
be
delivered
to
appellee.
so
that
a
person
who
may
privately
have
wanted
to
obtain
these
magazines
for
his
own
entertainment,
for
his
own
amusement,
or
for
his
own
information
would
have
this
fact
known
into
the
postal
authorities
whether
he
wanted
them
to
know
about
it
or
not.
we
have
here
in
short
the
kind
of
federal
censorship
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
was
not
tolerable
under
the
first
amendment.
very
interesting
to
me
is
the
fact
that
counsel
has
not
mentioned
at
all
the
most
recent
case
decided
by
this
court,
rowan
which
seems
to
me
to
be
dispositive
of
the
issue.
because
after
all
in
rowan,
this
court
said
that
the
householder,
the
free
american
citizen
was
to
decide
what
came
into
his
home
or
what
did
not
come
into
his
home.
so
that
in
rowan,
the
focus
was
on
the
right
of
the
free
citizen
to
say,
i
do
not
want
this.
this
case
deals
with
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
free
citizen
to
say,
i
do,
yes
i
want
this,
and
the
right
of
the
government
to
say
in
spite
of
that
that
you
cannot
have
it.
the
question
is
not
as
the
government
has
put
it
of
whether
the
first
amendment
confers
complete
freedom
uncontrollable
by
congress
to
use
the
mails
for
commercial
purposes.
we
of
course
do
recognize
the
binding
effect
of
rowan
which
puts
a
limitation
on
the
use
of
the
mails
and
not
yet
in
effect.
congress
has
already
implemented
perhaps,
without
knowing
yet,
important
portions
of
the
lockhart
commission
report
on
obscenity
and
pornography.
the
congress
has
enacted
39
u.s.c.
section
3010
and
3011
which
now
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
--
no,
i’m
sorry
that’s
section
18
u.s.c.
1735
and
1737
which
now
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
to
mail
to
unwilling
persons
material
dealing
with
sex
and
section
3010
and
3011
imposes
additional
burdens
on
a
mailer
to
make
sure
that
a
mail
or
a
person
does
not
mail
to
those
persons
who
don’t
want
it
and
does
not
mail
to
minors.
those
sections
provide
for
the
post
office
department
to
make
up
a
list
throughout
america
of
everybody
who
does
not
want
to
be
contaminated
by
sex.
if
a
person
doesn’t
want
have
anything
to
do
with
sex,
he
can
put
his
name
on
the
list
and
he
won’t
have
any,
fine,
but
we
have
that
kind
of
protection
in
the
law
now.
so
the
good
question
we
have
here
is,
what
about
the
right,
what
about
the
right
of
the
people
who
want
to
have
material
dealing
with
sex
and
it’s
about
that
i
want
to
address
myself.
the
government
takes
interesting
positions.
in
rowan,
in
rowan
the
government
said
perhaps
the
most
private
kind
of
communication
is
by
the
mail.
perhaps
if
ever
stanley
can
be
appropriately
given
full
bloom,
it’s
when
you
have
distribution
by
first
class
mail
to
consenting
adults.
in
its
brief,
the
government
says
“if
stanley
does
protect
such
activity
then
it
might
appear
that
use
of
the
mails
inherently
private
and
the
case
of
mail
ordered
blank
ordinarily
consensual
is
indeed
protected
from
government
regulation.”
on
that
reasoning,
only
the
uninvited
advertisement
or
mailing
of
obscene
mandatory
minor
could
be
made
an
offense
and
roth
would
have
not
only
been
a
limited,
but
the
government
says
overruled.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
nothing
in
stanley
that
deals
with
mail.
there
is
a
lot
in
stanley
though
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
i
know
where
i
got
it
from
mr.
justice
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
see,
that‘s
true
but
as
we
read
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
he
might
have
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
everything.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
everything
because
as
i
read
stanley,
stanley
was
decided
on
first
amendment
grounds.
mr.
justice
stewart
didn’t
join
in
that
opinion
thinking
that
it
ought
have
gone
off
on
privacy
grounds
or
fourth
amendment
grounds
and
as
i
read
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
he’s
here
to
correct
me,
where
he
said
he
was
not
anxious
to
hurry
on
to
new
constitutional
frontiers.
now
i
read
stanley
as
going
on
to
new
constitutional
frontiers
and
rightly
so
because
roth
was
a
debouch
in
its
application.
after
13
years
of
using
roth
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
honor
you
wrote
the
opinion
and
all
i
can
do
is
read
the
opinion,
but
in
stanley
you
went
back
to
winters.
the
key
to
roth,
the
whole
key
to
roth
was
that
obscenity
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
and
that
because
it
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
then
it
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now
your
honor
twice,
twice
in
stanley
said
that
a
person
has
right
to
obtain
obscene
materials,
so
called
“sexual
explicit
material”
whether
or
not
it
had
any
redeeming
social
value,
twice
you
sided
winters.
winters
says
that
material
is
protected
whether
or
not
it
has
any
social
value,
that
is
the
underpinning
of
roth.
now
it
maybe
but
that
i
--
because
roth
had
us
its
premise
two
things,
both
of
which
are
now
gone.
first
was
the
reliance
on
beauharnais.
in
roth
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
beauharnais
had
recognized
that
there
was
a
kind
of
speech,
libel
and
obscenity
which
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
since
then,
beauharnais
has
been
significantly
changed
as
we
see
it
by
the
new
york
times
case
and
cases
which
have
followed
it.
the
other
underpinning
for
roth
was
this
social
value
test
and
stanley
rejected
the
social
value
test.
i
don’t
know
what
else
was
in
your
mind
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
that
was
the
pinning
and
that
was
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
i
hesitate
to
quarrel
with
the
author
of
an
opinion.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
perhaps
your
honor,
i
would
hope
that
it
would
make
it
clearer
to
bring
about
the
kind
of
rationality
that
we
need
in
this
area
because
if
we
are
going
to
follow
the
confusion
that
has
been
brought
about
by
saying
that
obscenity
is
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
i
very
much
fear
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
will
have
really
the
kind
of
witch
hunt
that
we
have
not
had
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
in
this
country.
so
that
i
would
hope
that
when
this
is
clarified,
that
the
clarification
would
be
in
the
direction
of
sanity
which
is
basically
that
consenting
adults
should
have
the
right
to
choose
their
own
reading
matter
even
if
the
reading
matter
has
to
do
with
sex.
i
have
never
understood
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
with
the
what
opinion?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
i
agree.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
i
know
that
court
will,
because
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
problem
now
for
13
years.
it
was
a
difficult
problem
and
i
don’t
think
that
anybody
sitting
on
the
bench
or
who
has
considered
the
problem
at
all
could
be
satisfied
with
what
has
happened
in
the
area
of
obscenity
and
the
first
amendment.
no
one
knows
to
this
day
what
obscenity
is,
mr.
justice
harlin
had
occasion
to
comment
on
--
in
the
sam
ginsburg
case
that
anyone
looking
at
the
opinions
in
the
13
years
would
find
them
self
in
total
complete
bewilderment.
and
the
reason
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
after
13
years
if
the
rule
isn’t
working,
there’s
something
wrong
with
the
rule
and
what
was
wrong
with
the
rule
was
i
submit
that
the
notion
that
sex
speech
was
not
speech
and
therefore
that
it
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
was
a
false
premise.
obscenity
after
all
is
nothing
but
sex
speech
which
a
lot
of
people
don’t
like,
that’s
all
it
is.
it’s
like
saying
that
religious
speech
that
we
don’t
like
is
somehow
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now
there
is
a
great
deal
of
additional
knowledge
that
we
have
obtained
since
roth
came
down
which
ties
into
the
correctness
mr.
justice
marshall
of
your
statement
that
a
social
value
is
not
a
correct
test.
and
it’s
very
interesting
that
in
the
lockhart
commission
report
where
they
spent
something
like
$2
million
and
two
years,
the
commission
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
material
which
we
have
all
been
calling
obscene
in
fact
does
have
social
value.
that
is
to
say
that
the
people
who
have
been
buying
the
material
and
reading
it
have
benefited
by
it.
they
have
learned
about
sex
in
a
way
that
was
helpful
to
them.
they
have
had
their
entertainment
satisfied.
they
have
had
their
curiosity
satisfied
so
that
the
whole
assumption
of
roth
that
explicitly
sexual
material
was
totally
without
any
value,
i
submit
is
factually
untrue
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
that’s
at
least
what
the
lockhart
commission
has
concluded.
now
also
in
stanley
as
i
read
it,
is
the
recognition
of
the
right
to
receive
material,
again,
the
right
to
receive
material
regardless
of
the
social
worth
of
the
material.
so
that
if
a
person
has
the
right
to
possess
it
and
if
he
has
the
right
to
receive
it,
then
we
submit
that
there
must
be
the
right
to
distribute
it
subject
to
the
legitimate
state
interest
and
we
grant
there
are
legitimate
federal
interests.
those
interests
are
represented
in
part
by
the
rowan
decision,
that’s
one
of
it,
un-consenting
persons,
minors
are
out.
you
cannot
thrust
this
kind
of
material
upon
those
who
do
not
want
it
and
as
i
say
rowan
is
one
recognition
of
this
aspect,
the
other
recognition
is
in
the
recently
passed
laws
which
have
not
yet
gone
into
effect.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
it
did
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
two
federal
statutes
which
have
passed
--
have
been
passed
are
modeled
although
they
are
parallel,
i
don’t
think
the
congress
modeled
it
upon
the
lockhart
report,
but
they
come
out
about
the
same
and
the
lockhart
report
says
that
they
think
there
were
two
alternatives
and
that
the
commission
believe
that
the
path
that
congress
took
in
terms
of
making
it
a
criminal
offense
in
addition
to
what
rowan
did,
was
just
to
say
you
could
keep
it
out,
but
now
it
is
a
criminal
offense
to
mail
to
un-consenting
adults
or
to
minors
and
the
lockhart
commission
has
stated
that
that
was
the
preference
for
them
so
far
as
federal
is
concerned.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
part
of
it
but
the
new
legislation
your
honor
goes
further
than
that
because
the
new
legislation
permits
the
post
office
department
to
prepare
a
list
of
persons
who
either
do
not
want
any
material
that’s
explicitly
sexual
or
do
not
want
it
for
their
minors
so
that
any
family
that
wants
to,
right
off
the
bat,
they
can
get
themselves
on
the
list
and
then
that
material
is
sent
to
that
house
on
the
penalty
of
being
a
criminal
offense
because
then
the
mailer
is
told
not
to
send
it
there.
so
that
actually
under
the
new
legislation
which
may
raise
some
problems,
i
don’t
want
to
talk
to
those,
but
at
least
that’s
where
the
lockhart
commission
went
in
terms
of
giving
maximum
freedom
really
to
everybody.
freedom
for
those
who
don’t
want
the
material
and
freedom
for
those
who
do,
it
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
it
is
actually
19
under
the
congressional
act,
a
person
under
--
between
18
and
19,
the
minors
would
be
denied
that
right
even
though
they
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
they
can
also
go
to
war
and
die
and
not
receive
the
literature.
now
in
rowan,
this
court
repeatedly,
seems
to
me
to
have
made
two
points.
number
one,
that
we
do
not
want
to
have
federal
censorship
or
the
appearance
of
federal
censorship.
and
an
order
to
even
prevent
the
appearance
of
federal
censorship
that
the
household
would
be
given
total
and
complete
discretion
to
decide
what
could
be
kept
from
his
home
even
if
this
was
a
cs
robot
catalog,
i
think
was
one
of
the
illustrations.
and
instinct
with
that
whole
opinion
was
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
the
household
of
being
king
of
his
home.
that
if
he
didn’t
want
anything
he
could
keep
it
out
and
if
he
did
want
it,
he
had
every
right
to
have
it
come
in
to
his
home.
in
the
rowan
brief
and
i
understand
really
why
the
government
did
not
side
rowan
because
in
rowan
the
government
made
an
awful
lot
of
concessions
that
are
totally
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking
here.
for
example
in
its
brief
in
rowan,
on
page
six
at
footnote
1,
the
government
said
“that
adults
who
want
to
receive
obscene
material
can
receive
it
under
this
bill.”
that's
section
4009
which
was
involved
in
rowan,“
but
a
free
society
does
not
compel
people
to
receive
sexually
provocative
material.
it
does
not
compel
them
to
be
part
of
a
captive
audience.”
just
so,
just
so,
but
in
our
case
we’re
not
talking
about
a
captive
audience,
we
are
talking
about
adults
who
say
they
want
to
get
this
seven
girlie
magazines
and
incidentally
that’s
all
they
were.
they
were
girlie
magazines
of
the
kind
that
this
court
in
bloss
held
were
constitutionally
protected.
so
that
what
we
have
is
the
government
saying
“you
can’t
get
these
magazines
even
though
you
want
it
because
papa
knows
best.
we’re
going
to
protect
you
from
that.”
again
in
their
brief
in
rowan,
this
is
what
the
government
said
and
compare
it
with
their
argument
here
that
there
is
no
right
to
receive.
in
rowan
they
say
“in
making
the
assessment”
that’s
with
regard
to
section
4009
“congress
was
of
course
aware
that
the
freedoms
of
speech
and
press
embrace
the
rights
necessary
to
effectuate
those
freedoms,
including
the
right
to
circulate
and
receive
publications,
the
right
to
listen
and
the
right
to
read,”
citing
stanley,
martin
and
lamont
and
then
they
went
on
to
say
“as
this
court
suggested
in
martin,
section
4009
leaves
the
decision
to
accept
or
reject
the
material
with
the
homeowner
himself
and
again
the
government
goes
on
to
say
“the
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
wiling
recipients
are
unimpaired
by
section
4009.
they
are
put
under
no
burden
of
action
or
self
identification
to
receive
the
material
they
desire.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
this
is
the
government’s
brief
in
rowan.
and
then
finally
form
the
rowan
brief
at
page
36,
the
government
said
“the
determination
of
a
front
ought
to
be
left
to
individual
discretion
where
that
is
possible
without
impinging
on
the
free
circulation
of
ideas.
that
cause
is
possible
in
the
mails
as
it
is
perhaps
nowhere
else.”
now
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
told
us
and
quite
correctly
so
that
the
first
class
mail
is
just
as
private
as
the
home.
this
case
mr.
justice
stewart
does
involve
first
class
mail
only.
people
by
first
class
mail
ordered
material,
they
sent
their
money
in,
they
signed
an
order
blank
in
which
they
say
they
are
21
years
of
age
or
over
and
they
want
this
material
for
their
own
entertainment.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
from
the
mailer,
we
sent
out
the
brochure
and
the
persons
who
want
it
fill
in.
now
again
we
know
of
course
that
rowan
keeps
us
from
mailing
that
the
people
that
don’t
want
it.
if
they
don’t
want
it,
they
don’t
have
to
receive
the
mailer
in
the
first
place,
but
we
invite
them
to
buy
if
they
want.
so
that
what
the
post
office
now
is
doing
is
saying
that
those
persons
who
say
that
they’re
adults,
who
say
that
they
want
the
material,
who
spent
their
money
to
get
the
material,
the
government
says
“nope,
they
can’t
have
it.”
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
don’t
believe
that’s
in
the
record
and
i’m
not
sure
that
i
could
answer
that.
there
is
in
the
record,
the
brochure
in
the
second
case
in
section
4000,
the
book
bin.
well
i
don’t
believe
the
brochure
is
here,
but
i
would
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
record
where
they
describe
the
brochure.
on
page
55
of
the
government’s
brief
they
say
at
the
middle
of
the
page
for
accuracy
“none
of
the
advertising
can
surpass
exhibit
f2
which
in
touting
girlfriend,
bunny
golden
girl
and
match
promises,
unusual
photographic
techniques
exploring
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
female
form.
additional
emphasizes
is
placed
on
the
inner
beauty
of
our
models
as
the
camera
explores
bodily
regions
never
attempted
before,
close
attention
to
detail.”
that’s
the
brochure,
they
say
that
that
describes
it
accurately,
so
that
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
an
advertisement
which
says
you
are
going
to
get
pictures
of
nudes
if
you
want
them
and
then
you
can
pay
your
money
and
obtain
it.
so
that
there
is
no
question
here
of
any
intrusion
upon
any
unwilling
recipient.
the
record
shows
only
that
as
i
said
before
a
postal
inspector
sent
in
his
money,
he
filled
out
the
order
blank
and
got
his
magazines
and
based
upon
this
postal
inspector
who
is
over
21
years
of
age
getting
the
publication,
all
of
these
proceedings
were
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
is
not,
it
would
reach
--
it
would
go
into
section
4009
then,
there
might
be
a
4009
problem
but
it
would
not
change
this
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
just
one
more
word
about
the
stanley
case
and
its
relationship
to
the
lockhart
commission.
i
don’t
think
i
should
go
on
without
commenting
on
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
courts
throughout
the
country,
federal
and
state
have
interpreted
stanley
generally
the
way
we
have
been
talking
about
it
today.
the
lockhart
commission,
after
a
great
deal
of
study,
came
to
basically
the
same
conclusion
that
in
a
free
society
there
is
no
other
way
to
handle
the
problem
other
than
by
permitting,
consenting
adults
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
and
interest
in
matters
pertaining
to
sex.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
only
of
course
partially
true
mr.
justice
stewart
because
underlying
the
questions
of
law,
are
certain
assumed
facts.
for
example
once
we
learn
that
there
is
social
value
in
what
we
have
always
been
calling
obscenity
then
we
have
a
whole
different
legal
question.
the
assumption
upon
which
the
law
proceeded
we
now
know
is
false
if
we
accept
a
conclusion
of
the
lockhart
commission.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
of
course
not,
that’s
what
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
recommending
policy
but
based
on
facts
instead
of
prejudice
and
fear,
which
i
think
makes
a
big
difference.
it
should
also
be
observed
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
the
free
world
appears
to
be
traveling
in
the
same
direction.
not
only
denmark
has
abolished
its
obscenity
laws,
sweden,
the
last
i
heard
was
about
to
do
so
and
i
think
they
have
by
now.
in
west
germany,
the
highest
court
has
concluded
that
so
far
as
consenting
adults
are
concerned
that
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
receive
and
should
be
the
opportunity
of
selling
to
consenting
adults.
there
have
been
studies
in
both
israel
and
great
britain
which
were
comparable
to
the
lockhart
report
reaching
basically
the
same
conclusions.
and
indeed
the
whole
area
of
saying
that
people
should
be
able
to
read
what
they
want
in
this
area
touches
upon
another
area
of
the
law
that
has
a
relevance
and
that
is
that
consenting
adults
ought
to
be
able
to
do
what
they
want
to
do
at
least
in
the
area
of
sex.
we
all
know
about
the
model
penal
code
turn
to
the
graph
number
four
which
came
out
in
1954
and
which
basically
said
that
what
adults
do
privately
is
no
legitimate
concern
of
government.
whatever
approach
we
take
in
that
regard
surely
by
1970,
we
have
to
agree,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
think
about
and
dream
about
all
of
the
sexual
fantasies
that
are
running
through
our
heads
anyhow.
there
was
one
very
interesting
study
in
the
lockhart
report
that
perhaps
bears
repeating
here.
a
group
of
persons
were
showing
the
most
pornographic
pictures
that
the
researchers
could
get
and
then
they
were
measured
for
the
impact
on
the
individuals
both
in
terms
of
heartbeat,
blood
pressure,
dilation
of
eyes
and
things
like
that.
then
the
same
people
were
told
to
just
imagine
to
draw
their
own
pictures
in
their
own
heads
and
the
effect
was
twice
as
much.
in
short
the
individual
was
able
to
create
his
own
much
better
than
any
of
the
mailers
could
create.
the
short
of
the
matter
is
we
are
going
to
dream
anyhow
so
we
may
as
well
accept
it
in
terms
of
having
a
little
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
and
i
will
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
have
saved
the
remaining
5
minutes
for
that
and
i
will
now
address
myself
to
it.
first
of
all,
the
statute
plainly
does
violate
the
freedman
principle.
under
the
--
under
this
federal
censorship
law,
the
post
office
department
can
execute
its
own
order.
that
is
to
say
once
the
post
office
department
decides
that
the
material
is
obscene
then
the
mail
is
interfered
with.
the
burden
is
upon
us
to
file
a
lawsuit
if
we
want
to
do
something
and
even
up
until
--
even
if
we
would
file
a
lawsuit
there
is
no
assurance
that
the
mail
will
not
be
sent
back.
when
we
file
the
lawsuit
there
are
no
time
requirements
within
which
the
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
we
are
right
or
wrong
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
placed
upon
us
when
we
file
the
lawsuit.
the
statute
is
also
dead
because
it
permits
an
administrative
official,
a
post
office
judicial
office
who
really
is
a
censor
in
spite
of
what
government
counsel
says,
it
says
censorship
board
when
this
judicial
officer
acts,
he
is
acting
as
a
censor.
he
makes
the
determination
rather
than
a
jury
and
as
far
back
is
the
kingsley
book
case
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
that
obscenity
could
only
be
properly
decided
by
a
jury
because
it
was
so
linked
with
the
question
of
the
average
person.
but
here
we
have
dispensation
of
the
jury
in
favor
of
a
postal
censor.
there
is
no
requirement
of
sceinta
at
all
and
this
court
has
said
even
though
the
obscenity
is
especially
vague
law
that
the
scienta
requirement
compensates
in
some
regard.
here
we
do
not
have
the
compensation
of
scienta
because
scienta
is
irrelevant
to
it
so
that
--
and
we
have
also
what’s
basically
a
lamont
point
because
here
what
happens
is
if
we
think
of
it
in
terms
of
the
householder
who
mails
a
letter
to
the
appellee
then
his
mail
is
interfered
with.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happens
is
a
man
will
send
in
his
money
and
he‘ll
never
get
a
response
because
the
post
office
department
has
impounded
really
the
mail.
now
if
it’s
true
that
under
the
unlawful
order
it
can
be
sent
back,
but
the
way
the
government
handles
it
while
litigation
is
pending,
it’s
neither
sent
back
nor
is
it
delivered
to
us
so
it’s
held.
now
you
take
this
case
so
for
about
a
year-and-half
people
have
been
sending
in
money
to
appellee
and
the
government
has
that
money.
so
that
we
have
the
kind
of
heavy
handed
intrusion
upon
the
mail
that
has
been
repeatedly
as
i
said
found
upon
by
this
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
the
government
is
just
holding
the
money,
mr.
justice
black.
they
don’t
hold
it,
they
don’t
return
it,
and
they
don’t
give
it
to
us.
they
say
that
when
this
case
is
finally
decided
then
they
will
either
return
it
to
the
person
who
sent
in
their
money
or
give
it
to
us.
in
the
meantime
though
something
like
a
year-and-half
has
expired
while
we
have
been
proceeding
this
way
and
again
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
are
talking
about
magazines
which
are
identical
to
magazines
found
to
be
not
obscene
by
this
court
where
a
state
proceeding
was
involved
not
a
federal
proceeding
and
at
least
as
so
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concerned
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
there
is
no
question,
but
that
the
material
is
not
hardcore
pornography
either
that
and
that
it’s
in
fact
constitutionally
protected
material
under
this
court’s
standards
vague
as
they
are
and
unsatisfactory
as
those
standards
are.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
go
to
some
of
it,
but
not
really
cure
it
because
what
the
government
says
is
that
you
can
interpret
the
statute
and
say
that
first
of
all
if,
if
we
file
a
lawsuit,
first
of
all
the
burden
is
still
upon
us
to
file
the
lawsuit
while
in
freedman
the
burden
was
on
the
censor
to
file
the
lawsuit
to
vindicate
its
censorship
so
the
first
thing
is
that
it
becomes
our
burden
to
go
into
federal
court
to
bring
an
action
which
distinguishes
it
in
the
first
instance.
secondly
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
not
the
government’s
position
at
all.
what
the
government
did
say
was
that
there
is
another
of
section
of
the
law,
section
4007
and
that
4007
takes
care
of
some
of
the
problem,
but
if
you’re
thinking
in
terms
of
section
4006
alone,
it
is
not
the
government’s
contention
that
they
have
to
go
into
court
to
have
that
order
in
force.
they
do
not
treat
this
as
an
fcc
order
an
analogue
d
order
at
all,
they
still
say
that
we
would
have
to
go
into
court.
they
don’t
say
within
what
period
of
time
or
what
happens
really
to
the
mail
at
all.
but
their
proposal
is
that
we
could
go
into
court
and
then
when
we
go
to
court
then
the
mail
would
be
impounded
and
it
would
not
be
sent
back
to
the
persons
who
sent
it
to
us.
but
that
does
not
meet
freedman
and
at
least
and
really
any
other
respects.
we
have
to
go
into
court,
it’s
our
burden
to
prove,
to
satisfy
the
court
that
the
administrative
agency
was
wrong
and
there
still
would
be
no
time
requirements
of
the
time
required
by
friedman.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
another
statute
your
honor,
section
4009,
your
honor
is
quite
correct,
first
of
all
the
householder
gets
mail
and
he
is
to
satisfy
it
with
it.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
the
rowan,
but
under
section
3010
though
and
3011
which
are
new
statutes
which
have
just
been
passed
under
the
reorganization
law,
there
the
congress
has
said
that
there
is
a
way
of
preventing
the
householder
from
getting
even
the
first
mailing
and
that’s
when
the
householder
can
put
himself
on
this
list
and
say
i
do
not
want
to
receive
any
material
dealing
with
sex.
once
he
puts
himself
on
that
list
it
becomes
a
crime
to
send
it
to
him.so
he
doesn’t
get
the
first
mail.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
without
knowing
that
the
person
receiving
it
does
not
want
it,
is
that
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
don’t
think
congress
can
do
that
because
i
believe
that
just
as
people
who
do
not
want
it
have
the
right
to
say,
“no,
i
don’t
want
it,”
the
avenues
of
communication
must
be
left
free
for
those
who
in
fact
do
want
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
legislative
history
behind
section
4009
specifically
stated
that
that’s
what
they
wanted
to
keep
open.
for
those
people
who
wanted
to
receive
such
material
congress
said,
they
should
be
permitted
to.
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
every
way
that’s
fair
in
terms
of
saying
a
person
does
not
want
it
then
i
think
congress
can
have
a
lot
of
free
way
there
and
free
discretion
in
terms
of
preventing
that
where
there’s
an
unwilling
audience.
but
i
think
just
to
blanketly
say
you
can
send
out
any
advertisements
for
dealing
with
sex.
i
do
not
think
that
congress
could
constitutionally
do
that.
that’s
going
too
far.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
i
believe
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
necessarily,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
a
very
distinct
one
and
this
court
has
commented
upon
it
because
we
have
a
first
amendment,
which
protects
the
right
to
distribute
books
and
magazines
at
least
to
willing
persons.
there
is
no
comparable
or
constitutional
right
to
perpetuate
a
fraud.
additionally,
whatever
else
we
may
say
about
the
vagueness
inherent
in
the
term
obscenity,
we
know
that
a
post
office
hearing
examiner
who
is
really
a
censor
is
the
least
qualified
person
to
draw
that
fine
line
which
protect
--
which
separates
unconditionally
protected
speech
from
criminal
speech.
that’s
a
different
situation
than
you
have
with
fraud
so
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
in
my
judgment
to
say
that
this
statute
is
dead
as
it
applies
to
obscenity
because
we’re
either
in
the
first
amendment
area
of
directly
if
read
stanley
correctly
or
we
are
so
close
to
it
that
different
principles
apply
than
would
apply
in
fraud
area.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
court
please,
this
case
started
when
a
postal
inspector
inspector
representing
himself
as
being
over
21
years
of
age,
ordered
seven
magazines
which
he
said
he
wanted.
thereafter,
the
post
office
started
the
administrative
proceedings
that
were
discussed
by
mr.
strauss
and
had
the
order.
the
effect
of
which
was
to
keep
every
adult
person
in
america
who
made
similarly,
have
wanted
to
order
these
magazines
from
getting
these
magazines.
it
also
had
the
effect
of
invading
the
privacy
of
the
mail
because
persons
who
sent
first
class
mail
to
appellee
had
their
mail
poked
over
by
post
office
persons
in
the
office
there
to
see
whether
this
was
mailed
that
“could
or
should”
be
delivered
to
appellee.
so
that
a
person
who
may
privately
have
wanted
to
obtain
these
magazines
for
his
own
entertainment,
for
his
own
amusement,
or
for
his
own
information
would
have
this
fact
known
into
the
postal
authorities
whether
he
wanted
them
to
know
about
it
or
not.
we
have
here
in
short
the
kind
of
federal
censorship
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
was
not
tolerable
under
the
first
amendment.
very
interesting
to
me
is
the
fact
that
counsel
has
not
mentioned
at
all
the
most
recent
case
decided
by
this
court,
rowan
which
seems
to
me
to
be
dispositive
of
the
issue.
because
after
all
in
rowan,
this
court
said
that
the
householder,
the
free
american
citizen
was
to
decide
what
came
into
his
home
or
what
did
not
come
into
his
home.
so
that
in
rowan,
the
focus
was
on
the
right
of
the
free
citizen
to
say,
i
do
not
want
this.
this
case
deals
with
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
free
citizen
to
say,
i
do,
yes
i
want
this,
and
the
right
of
the
government
to
say
in
spite
of
that
that
you
cannot
have
it.
the
question
is
not
as
the
government
has
put
it
of
whether
the
first
amendment
confers
complete
freedom
uncontrollable
by
congress
to
use
the
mails
for
commercial
purposes.
we
of
course
do
recognize
the
binding
effect
of
rowan
which
puts
a
limitation
on
the
use
of
the
mails
and
not
yet
in
effect.
congress
has
already
implemented
perhaps,
without
knowing
yet,
important
portions
of
the
lockhart
commission
report
on
obscenity
and
pornography.
the
congress
has
enacted
39
u.s.c.
section
3010
and
3011
which
now
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
--
no,
i’m
sorry
that’s
section
18
u.s.c.
1735
and
1737
which
now
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
to
mail
to
unwilling
persons
material
dealing
with
sex
and
section
3010
and
3011
imposes
additional
burdens
on
a
mailer
to
make
sure
that
a
mail
or
a
person
does
not
mail
to
those
persons
who
don’t
want
it
and
does
not
mail
to
minors.
those
sections
provide
for
the
post
office
department
to
make
up
a
list
throughout
america
of
everybody
who
does
not
want
to
be
contaminated
by
sex.
if
a
person
doesn’t
want
have
anything
to
do
with
sex,
he
can
put
his
name
on
the
list
and
he
won’t
have
any,
fine,
but
we
have
that
kind
of
protection
in
the
law
now.
so
the
good
question
we
have
here
is,
what
about
the
right,
what
about
the
right
of
the
people
who
want
to
have
material
dealing
with
sex
and
it’s
about
that
i
want
to
address
myself.
the
government
takes
interesting
positions.
in
rowan,
in
rowan
the
government
said
perhaps
the
most
private
kind
of
communication
is
by
the
mail.
perhaps
if
ever
stanley
can
be
appropriately
given
full
bloom,
it’s
when
you
have
distribution
by
first
class
mail
to
consenting
adults.
in
its
brief,
the
government
says
“if
stanley
does
protect
such
activity
then
it
might
appear
that
use
of
the
mails
inherently
private
and
the
case
of
mail
ordered
blank
ordinarily
consensual
is
indeed
protected
from
government
regulation.”
on
that
reasoning,
only
the
uninvited
advertisement
or
mailing
of
obscene
mandatory
minor
could
be
made
an
offense
and
roth
would
have
not
only
been
a
limited,
but
the
government
says
overruled.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
nothing
in
stanley
that
deals
with
mail.
there
is
a
lot
in
stanley
though
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
i
know
where
i
got
it
from
mr.
justice
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
see,
that‘s
true
but
as
we
read
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
he
might
have
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
everything.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
everything
because
as
i
read
stanley,
stanley
was
decided
on
first
amendment
grounds.
mr.
justice
stewart
didn’t
join
in
that
opinion
thinking
that
it
ought
have
gone
off
on
privacy
grounds
or
fourth
amendment
grounds
and
as
i
read
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
he’s
here
to
correct
me,
where
he
said
he
was
not
anxious
to
hurry
on
to
new
constitutional
frontiers.
now
i
read
stanley
as
going
on
to
new
constitutional
frontiers
and
rightly
so
because
roth
was
a
debouch
in
its
application.
after
13
years
of
using
roth
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
your
honor
you
wrote
the
opinion
and
all
i
can
do
is
read
the
opinion,
but
in
stanley
you
went
back
to
winters.
the
key
to
roth,
the
whole
key
to
roth
was
that
obscenity
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
and
that
because
it
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
then
it
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now
your
honor
twice,
twice
in
stanley
said
that
a
person
has
right
to
obtain
obscene
materials,
so
called
“sexual
explicit
material”
whether
or
not
it
had
any
redeeming
social
value,
twice
you
sided
winters.
winters
says
that
material
is
protected
whether
or
not
it
has
any
social
value,
that
is
the
underpinning
of
roth.
now
it
maybe
but
that
i
--
because
roth
had
us
its
premise
two
things,
both
of
which
are
now
gone.
first
was
the
reliance
on
beauharnais.
in
roth
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
beauharnais
had
recognized
that
there
was
a
kind
of
speech,
libel
and
obscenity
which
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
since
then,
beauharnais
has
been
significantly
changed
as
we
see
it
by
the
new
york
times
case
and
cases
which
have
followed
it.
the
other
underpinning
for
roth
was
this
social
value
test
and
stanley
rejected
the
social
value
test.
i
don’t
know
what
else
was
in
your
mind
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
that
was
the
pinning
and
that
was
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
i
hesitate
to
quarrel
with
the
author
of
an
opinion.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
perhaps
your
honor,
i
would
hope
that
it
would
make
it
clearer
to
bring
about
the
kind
of
rationality
that
we
need
in
this
area
because
if
we
are
going
to
follow
the
confusion
that
has
been
brought
about
by
saying
that
obscenity
is
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
i
very
much
fear
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
will
have
really
the
kind
of
witch
hunt
that
we
have
not
had
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
in
this
country.
so
that
i
would
hope
that
when
this
is
clarified,
that
the
clarification
would
be
in
the
direction
of
sanity
which
is
basically
that
consenting
adults
should
have
the
right
to
choose
their
own
reading
matter
even
if
the
reading
matter
has
to
do
with
sex.
i
have
never
understood
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
with
the
what
opinion?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
i
agree.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
i
know
that
court
will,
because
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
problem
now
for
13
years.
it
was
a
difficult
problem
and
i
don’t
think
that
anybody
sitting
on
the
bench
or
who
has
considered
the
problem
at
all
could
be
satisfied
with
what
has
happened
in
the
area
of
obscenity
and
the
first
amendment.
no
one
knows
to
this
day
what
obscenity
is,
mr.
justice
harlin
had
occasion
to
comment
on
--
in
the
sam
ginsburg
case
that
anyone
looking
at
the
opinions
in
the
13
years
would
find
them
self
in
total
complete
bewilderment.
and
the
reason
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
after
13
years
if
the
rule
isn’t
working,
there’s
something
wrong
with
the
rule
and
what
was
wrong
with
the
rule
was
i
submit
that
the
notion
that
sex
speech
was
not
speech
and
therefore
that
it
was
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
was
a
false
premise.
obscenity
after
all
is
nothing
but
sex
speech
which
a
lot
of
people
don’t
like,
that’s
all
it
is.
it’s
like
saying
that
religious
speech
that
we
don’t
like
is
somehow
outside
of
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now
there
is
a
great
deal
of
additional
knowledge
that
we
have
obtained
since
roth
came
down
which
ties
into
the
correctness
mr.
justice
marshall
of
your
statement
that
a
social
value
is
not
a
correct
test.
and
it’s
very
interesting
that
in
the
lockhart
commission
report
where
they
spent
something
like
$2
million
and
two
years,
the
commission
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
material
which
we
have
all
been
calling
obscene
in
fact
does
have
social
value.
that
is
to
say
that
the
people
who
have
been
buying
the
material
and
reading
it
have
benefited
by
it.
they
have
learned
about
sex
in
a
way
that
was
helpful
to
them.
they
have
had
their
entertainment
satisfied.
they
have
had
their
curiosity
satisfied
so
that
the
whole
assumption
of
roth
that
explicitly
sexual
material
was
totally
without
any
value,
i
submit
is
factually
untrue
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
that’s
at
least
what
the
lockhart
commission
has
concluded.
now
also
in
stanley
as
i
read
it,
is
the
recognition
of
the
right
to
receive
material,
again,
the
right
to
receive
material
regardless
of
the
social
worth
of
the
material.
so
that
if
a
person
has
the
right
to
possess
it
and
if
he
has
the
right
to
receive
it,
then
we
submit
that
there
must
be
the
right
to
distribute
it
subject
to
the
legitimate
state
interest
and
we
grant
there
are
legitimate
federal
interests.
those
interests
are
represented
in
part
by
the
rowan
decision,
that’s
one
of
it,
un-consenting
persons,
minors
are
out.
you
cannot
thrust
this
kind
of
material
upon
those
who
do
not
want
it
and
as
i
say
rowan
is
one
recognition
of
this
aspect,
the
other
recognition
is
in
the
recently
passed
laws
which
have
not
yet
gone
into
effect.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
it
did
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
two
federal
statutes
which
have
passed
--
have
been
passed
are
modeled
although
they
are
parallel,
i
don’t
think
the
congress
modeled
it
upon
the
lockhart
report,
but
they
come
out
about
the
same
and
the
lockhart
report
says
that
they
think
there
were
two
alternatives
and
that
the
commission
believe
that
the
path
that
congress
took
in
terms
of
making
it
a
criminal
offense
in
addition
to
what
rowan
did,
was
just
to
say
you
could
keep
it
out,
but
now
it
is
a
criminal
offense
to
mail
to
un-consenting
adults
or
to
minors
and
the
lockhart
commission
has
stated
that
that
was
the
preference
for
them
so
far
as
federal
is
concerned.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
part
of
it
but
the
new
legislation
your
honor
goes
further
than
that
because
the
new
legislation
permits
the
post
office
department
to
prepare
a
list
of
persons
who
either
do
not
want
any
material
that’s
explicitly
sexual
or
do
not
want
it
for
their
minors
so
that
any
family
that
wants
to,
right
off
the
bat,
they
can
get
themselves
on
the
list
and
then
that
material
is
sent
to
that
house
on
the
penalty
of
being
a
criminal
offense
because
then
the
mailer
is
told
not
to
send
it
there.
so
that
actually
under
the
new
legislation
which
may
raise
some
problems,
i
don’t
want
to
talk
to
those,
but
at
least
that’s
where
the
lockhart
commission
went
in
terms
of
giving
maximum
freedom
really
to
everybody.
freedom
for
those
who
don’t
want
the
material
and
freedom
for
those
who
do,
it
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
it
is
actually
19
under
the
congressional
act,
a
person
under
--
between
18
and
19,
the
minors
would
be
denied
that
right
even
though
they
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
your
honor.
they
can
also
go
to
war
and
die
and
not
receive
the
literature.
now
in
rowan,
this
court
repeatedly,
seems
to
me
to
have
made
two
points.
number
one,
that
we
do
not
want
to
have
federal
censorship
or
the
appearance
of
federal
censorship.
and
an
order
to
even
prevent
the
appearance
of
federal
censorship
that
the
household
would
be
given
total
and
complete
discretion
to
decide
what
could
be
kept
from
his
home
even
if
this
was
a
cs
robot
catalog,
i
think
was
one
of
the
illustrations.
and
instinct
with
that
whole
opinion
was
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
the
household
of
being
king
of
his
home.
that
if
he
didn’t
want
anything
he
could
keep
it
out
and
if
he
did
want
it,
he
had
every
right
to
have
it
come
in
to
his
home.
in
the
rowan
brief
and
i
understand
really
why
the
government
did
not
side
rowan
because
in
rowan
the
government
made
an
awful
lot
of
concessions
that
are
totally
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking
here.
for
example
in
its
brief
in
rowan,
on
page
six
at
footnote
1,
the
government
said
“that
adults
who
want
to
receive
obscene
material
can
receive
it
under
this
bill.”
that's
section
4009
which
was
involved
in
rowan,“
but
a
free
society
does
not
compel
people
to
receive
sexually
provocative
material.
it
does
not
compel
them
to
be
part
of
a
captive
audience.”
just
so,
just
so,
but
in
our
case
we’re
not
talking
about
a
captive
audience,
we
are
talking
about
adults
who
say
they
want
to
get
this
seven
girlie
magazines
and
incidentally
that’s
all
they
were.
they
were
girlie
magazines
of
the
kind
that
this
court
in
bloss
held
were
constitutionally
protected.
so
that
what
we
have
is
the
government
saying
“you
can’t
get
these
magazines
even
though
you
want
it
because
papa
knows
best.
we’re
going
to
protect
you
from
that.”
again
in
their
brief
in
rowan,
this
is
what
the
government
said
and
compare
it
with
their
argument
here
that
there
is
no
right
to
receive.
in
rowan
they
say
“in
making
the
assessment”
that’s
with
regard
to
section
4009
“congress
was
of
course
aware
that
the
freedoms
of
speech
and
press
embrace
the
rights
necessary
to
effectuate
those
freedoms,
including
the
right
to
circulate
and
receive
publications,
the
right
to
listen
and
the
right
to
read,”
citing
stanley,
martin
and
lamont
and
then
they
went
on
to
say
“as
this
court
suggested
in
martin,
section
4009
leaves
the
decision
to
accept
or
reject
the
material
with
the
homeowner
himself
and
again
the
government
goes
on
to
say
“the
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
wiling
recipients
are
unimpaired
by
section
4009.
they
are
put
under
no
burden
of
action
or
self
identification
to
receive
the
material
they
desire.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
this
is
the
government’s
brief
in
rowan.
and
then
finally
form
the
rowan
brief
at
page
36,
the
government
said
“the
determination
of
a
front
ought
to
be
left
to
individual
discretion
where
that
is
possible
without
impinging
on
the
free
circulation
of
ideas.
that
cause
is
possible
in
the
mails
as
it
is
perhaps
nowhere
else.”
now
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
told
us
and
quite
correctly
so
that
the
first
class
mail
is
just
as
private
as
the
home.
this
case
mr.
justice
stewart
does
involve
first
class
mail
only.
people
by
first
class
mail
ordered
material,
they
sent
their
money
in,
they
signed
an
order
blank
in
which
they
say
they
are
21
years
of
age
or
over
and
they
want
this
material
for
their
own
entertainment.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
from
the
mailer,
we
sent
out
the
brochure
and
the
persons
who
want
it
fill
in.
now
again
we
know
of
course
that
rowan
keeps
us
from
mailing
that
the
people
that
don’t
want
it.
if
they
don’t
want
it,
they
don’t
have
to
receive
the
mailer
in
the
first
place,
but
we
invite
them
to
buy
if
they
want.
so
that
what
the
post
office
now
is
doing
is
saying
that
those
persons
who
say
that
they’re
adults,
who
say
that
they
want
the
material,
who
spent
their
money
to
get
the
material,
the
government
says
“nope,
they
can’t
have
it.”
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
don’t
believe
that’s
in
the
record
and
i’m
not
sure
that
i
could
answer
that.
there
is
in
the
record,
the
brochure
in
the
second
case
in
section
4000,
the
book
bin.
well
i
don’t
believe
the
brochure
is
here,
but
i
would
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
record
where
they
describe
the
brochure.
on
page
55
of
the
government’s
brief
they
say
at
the
middle
of
the
page
for
accuracy
“none
of
the
advertising
can
surpass
exhibit
f2
which
in
touting
girlfriend,
bunny
golden
girl
and
match
promises,
unusual
photographic
techniques
exploring
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
female
form.
additional
emphasizes
is
placed
on
the
inner
beauty
of
our
models
as
the
camera
explores
bodily
regions
never
attempted
before,
close
attention
to
detail.”
that’s
the
brochure,
they
say
that
that
describes
it
accurately,
so
that
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
an
advertisement
which
says
you
are
going
to
get
pictures
of
nudes
if
you
want
them
and
then
you
can
pay
your
money
and
obtain
it.
so
that
there
is
no
question
here
of
any
intrusion
upon
any
unwilling
recipient.
the
record
shows
only
that
as
i
said
before
a
postal
inspector
sent
in
his
money,
he
filled
out
the
order
blank
and
got
his
magazines
and
based
upon
this
postal
inspector
who
is
over
21
years
of
age
getting
the
publication,
all
of
these
proceedings
were
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
is
not,
it
would
reach
--
it
would
go
into
section
4009
then,
there
might
be
a
4009
problem
but
it
would
not
change
this
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
just
one
more
word
about
the
stanley
case
and
its
relationship
to
the
lockhart
commission.
i
don’t
think
i
should
go
on
without
commenting
on
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
courts
throughout
the
country,
federal
and
state
have
interpreted
stanley
generally
the
way
we
have
been
talking
about
it
today.
the
lockhart
commission,
after
a
great
deal
of
study,
came
to
basically
the
same
conclusion
that
in
a
free
society
there
is
no
other
way
to
handle
the
problem
other
than
by
permitting,
consenting
adults
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
and
interest
in
matters
pertaining
to
sex.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
only
of
course
partially
true
mr.
justice
stewart
because
underlying
the
questions
of
law,
are
certain
assumed
facts.
for
example
once
we
learn
that
there
is
social
value
in
what
we
have
always
been
calling
obscenity
then
we
have
a
whole
different
legal
question.
the
assumption
upon
which
the
law
proceeded
we
now
know
is
false
if
we
accept
a
conclusion
of
the
lockhart
commission.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
of
course
not,
that’s
what
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
recommending
policy
but
based
on
facts
instead
of
prejudice
and
fear,
which
i
think
makes
a
big
difference.
it
should
also
be
observed
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
the
free
world
appears
to
be
traveling
in
the
same
direction.
not
only
denmark
has
abolished
its
obscenity
laws,
sweden,
the
last
i
heard
was
about
to
do
so
and
i
think
they
have
by
now.
in
west
germany,
the
highest
court
has
concluded
that
so
far
as
consenting
adults
are
concerned
that
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
receive
and
should
be
the
opportunity
of
selling
to
consenting
adults.
there
have
been
studies
in
both
israel
and
great
britain
which
were
comparable
to
the
lockhart
report
reaching
basically
the
same
conclusions.
and
indeed
the
whole
area
of
saying
that
people
should
be
able
to
read
what
they
want
in
this
area
touches
upon
another
area
of
the
law
that
has
a
relevance
and
that
is
that
consenting
adults
ought
to
be
able
to
do
what
they
want
to
do
at
least
in
the
area
of
sex.
we
all
know
about
the
model
penal
code
turn
to
the
graph
number
four
which
came
out
in
1954
and
which
basically
said
that
what
adults
do
privately
is
no
legitimate
concern
of
government.
whatever
approach
we
take
in
that
regard
surely
by
1970,
we
have
to
agree,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
think
about
and
dream
about
all
of
the
sexual
fantasies
that
are
running
through
our
heads
anyhow.
there
was
one
very
interesting
study
in
the
lockhart
report
that
perhaps
bears
repeating
here.
a
group
of
persons
were
showing
the
most
pornographic
pictures
that
the
researchers
could
get
and
then
they
were
measured
for
the
impact
on
the
individuals
both
in
terms
of
heartbeat,
blood
pressure,
dilation
of
eyes
and
things
like
that.
then
the
same
people
were
told
to
just
imagine
to
draw
their
own
pictures
in
their
own
heads
and
the
effect
was
twice
as
much.
in
short
the
individual
was
able
to
create
his
own
much
better
than
any
of
the
mailers
could
create.
the
short
of
the
matter
is
we
are
going
to
dream
anyhow
so
we
may
as
well
accept
it
in
terms
of
having
a
little
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
and
i
will
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
have
saved
the
remaining
5
minutes
for
that
and
i
will
now
address
myself
to
it.
first
of
all,
the
statute
plainly
does
violate
the
freedman
principle.
under
the
--
under
this
federal
censorship
law,
the
post
office
department
can
execute
its
own
order.
that
is
to
say
once
the
post
office
department
decides
that
the
material
is
obscene
then
the
mail
is
interfered
with.
the
burden
is
upon
us
to
file
a
lawsuit
if
we
want
to
do
something
and
even
up
until
--
even
if
we
would
file
a
lawsuit
there
is
no
assurance
that
the
mail
will
not
be
sent
back.
when
we
file
the
lawsuit
there
are
no
time
requirements
within
which
the
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
we
are
right
or
wrong
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
placed
upon
us
when
we
file
the
lawsuit.
the
statute
is
also
dead
because
it
permits
an
administrative
official,
a
post
office
judicial
office
who
really
is
a
censor
in
spite
of
what
government
counsel
says,
it
says
censorship
board
when
this
judicial
officer
acts,
he
is
acting
as
a
censor.
he
makes
the
determination
rather
than
a
jury
and
as
far
back
is
the
kingsley
book
case
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
that
obscenity
could
only
be
properly
decided
by
a
jury
because
it
was
so
linked
with
the
question
of
the
average
person.
but
here
we
have
dispensation
of
the
jury
in
favor
of
a
postal
censor.
there
is
no
requirement
of
sceinta
at
all
and
this
court
has
said
even
though
the
obscenity
is
especially
vague
law
that
the
scienta
requirement
compensates
in
some
regard.
here
we
do
not
have
the
compensation
of
scienta
because
scienta
is
irrelevant
to
it
so
that
--
and
we
have
also
what’s
basically
a
lamont
point
because
here
what
happens
is
if
we
think
of
it
in
terms
of
the
householder
who
mails
a
letter
to
the
appellee
then
his
mail
is
interfered
with.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happens
is
a
man
will
send
in
his
money
and
he‘ll
never
get
a
response
because
the
post
office
department
has
impounded
really
the
mail.
now
if
it’s
true
that
under
the
unlawful
order
it
can
be
sent
back,
but
the
way
the
government
handles
it
while
litigation
is
pending,
it’s
neither
sent
back
nor
is
it
delivered
to
us
so
it’s
held.
now
you
take
this
case
so
for
about
a
year-and-half
people
have
been
sending
in
money
to
appellee
and
the
government
has
that
money.
so
that
we
have
the
kind
of
heavy
handed
intrusion
upon
the
mail
that
has
been
repeatedly
as
i
said
found
upon
by
this
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
the
government
is
just
holding
the
money,
mr.
justice
black.
they
don’t
hold
it,
they
don’t
return
it,
and
they
don’t
give
it
to
us.
they
say
that
when
this
case
is
finally
decided
then
they
will
either
return
it
to
the
person
who
sent
in
their
money
or
give
it
to
us.
in
the
meantime
though
something
like
a
year-and-half
has
expired
while
we
have
been
proceeding
this
way
and
again
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
are
talking
about
magazines
which
are
identical
to
magazines
found
to
be
not
obscene
by
this
court
where
a
state
proceeding
was
involved
not
a
federal
proceeding
and
at
least
as
so
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concerned
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
there
is
no
question,
but
that
the
material
is
not
hardcore
pornography
either
that
and
that
it’s
in
fact
constitutionally
protected
material
under
this
court’s
standards
vague
as
they
are
and
unsatisfactory
as
those
standards
are.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
go
to
some
of
it,
but
not
really
cure
it
because
what
the
government
says
is
that
you
can
interpret
the
statute
and
say
that
first
of
all
if,
if
we
file
a
lawsuit,
first
of
all
the
burden
is
still
upon
us
to
file
the
lawsuit
while
in
freedman
the
burden
was
on
the
censor
to
file
the
lawsuit
to
vindicate
its
censorship
so
the
first
thing
is
that
it
becomes
our
burden
to
go
into
federal
court
to
bring
an
action
which
distinguishes
it
in
the
first
instance.
secondly
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
not
the
government’s
position
at
all.
what
the
government
did
say
was
that
there
is
another
of
section
of
the
law,
section
4007
and
that
4007
takes
care
of
some
of
the
problem,
but
if
you’re
thinking
in
terms
of
section
4006
alone,
it
is
not
the
government’s
contention
that
they
have
to
go
into
court
to
have
that
order
in
force.
they
do
not
treat
this
as
an
fcc
order
an
analogue
d
order
at
all,
they
still
say
that
we
would
have
to
go
into
court.
they
don’t
say
within
what
period
of
time
or
what
happens
really
to
the
mail
at
all.
but
their
proposal
is
that
we
could
go
into
court
and
then
when
we
go
to
court
then
the
mail
would
be
impounded
and
it
would
not
be
sent
back
to
the
persons
who
sent
it
to
us.
but
that
does
not
meet
freedman
and
at
least
and
really
any
other
respects.
we
have
to
go
into
court,
it’s
our
burden
to
prove,
to
satisfy
the
court
that
the
administrative
agency
was
wrong
and
there
still
would
be
no
time
requirements
of
the
time
required
by
friedman.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
another
statute
your
honor,
section
4009,
your
honor
is
quite
correct,
first
of
all
the
householder
gets
mail
and
he
is
to
satisfy
it
with
it.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that’s
the
rowan,
but
under
section
3010
though
and
3011
which
are
new
statutes
which
have
just
been
passed
under
the
reorganization
law,
there
the
congress
has
said
that
there
is
a
way
of
preventing
the
householder
from
getting
even
the
first
mailing
and
that’s
when
the
householder
can
put
himself
on
this
list
and
say
i
do
not
want
to
receive
any
material
dealing
with
sex.
once
he
puts
himself
on
that
list
it
becomes
a
crime
to
send
it
to
him.so
he
doesn’t
get
the
first
mail.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
without
knowing
that
the
person
receiving
it
does
not
want
it,
is
that
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
don’t
think
congress
can
do
that
because
i
believe
that
just
as
people
who
do
not
want
it
have
the
right
to
say,
“no,
i
don’t
want
it,”
the
avenues
of
communication
must
be
left
free
for
those
who
in
fact
do
want
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
legislative
history
behind
section
4009
specifically
stated
that
that’s
what
they
wanted
to
keep
open.
for
those
people
who
wanted
to
receive
such
material
congress
said,
they
should
be
permitted
to.
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
every
way
that’s
fair
in
terms
of
saying
a
person
does
not
want
it
then
i
think
congress
can
have
a
lot
of
free
way
there
and
free
discretion
in
terms
of
preventing
that
where
there’s
an
unwilling
audience.
but
i
think
just
to
blanketly
say
you
can
send
out
any
advertisements
for
dealing
with
sex.
i
do
not
think
that
congress
could
constitutionally
do
that.
that’s
going
too
far.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
i
believe
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
not
necessarily,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
a
very
distinct
one
and
this
court
has
commented
upon
it
because
we
have
a
first
amendment,
which
protects
the
right
to
distribute
books
and
magazines
at
least
to
willing
persons.
there
is
no
comparable
or
constitutional
right
to
perpetuate
a
fraud.
additionally,
whatever
else
we
may
say
about
the
vagueness
inherent
in
the
term
obscenity,
we
know
that
a
post
office
hearing
examiner
who
is
really
a
censor
is
the
least
qualified
person
to
draw
that
fine
line
which
protect
--
which
separates
unconditionally
protected
speech
from
criminal
speech.
that’s
a
different
situation
than
you
have
with
fraud
so
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
in
my
judgment
to
say
that
this
statute
is
dead
as
it
applies
to
obscenity
because
we’re
either
in
the
first
amendment
area
of
directly
if
read
stanley
correctly
or
we
are
so
close
to
it
that
different
principles
apply
than
would
apply
in
fraud
area.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
