mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
central
district
of
california
has
held
section
4006
of
the
postal
code
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
in
the
book
bin
case
which
immediately
follows,
another
such
court
sitting
in
the
northern
district
to
georgia
also
held
section
4006
unconstitutional
on
its
face
together
with
section
4007
of
the
code.
and
because
of
the
similarity
of
the
issues,
the
government
filed
a
single
jurisdictional
statement,
brief
and
appendix
and
i
believe
that
will
be
helpful
now
to
make
a
statement
in
sufficient
detailed
to
illuminate
the
issue
in
both
cases.
and
i
say
parenthetically
that
while
i
will
continue
to
refer
to
the
statute
of
sections
4005
and
4006
under
the
postal
reform
act
passed
in
the
middle
of
the
summer,
they
are
now
actually
section
or
they
will
shortly
be
sections
3005
and
3006,
but
they
are
otherwise
unchanged.
the
decisions
in
both
courts
were
limited
to
procedural
questions
arising
under
the
statute.
while
the
papers
for
appellees
contended
that
the
publications
in
question
are
not
obscene,
my
understanding
is
that
the
proceedings
never
reached
that
point
and
that
in
fact
neither
of
the
three-judge
courts
which
decided
these
cases
ever
had
the
magazines
in
issue
before
them.
the
decisions
assumed
that
the
traffic
in
obscenity
could
be
barred
from
the
mails
and
considered
only
whether
these
two
sections
were
constitutionally
appropriate
procedures
for
accomplishing
that
purpose.
section
4006
provides
that
when
the
postmaster
general
finds
the
person
as
using
the
mails
to
sell
or
advertise
obscene
matter,
he
may
issue
an
administrative
order
intercepting
mail
addressed
to
that
person
and
directing
that
it
be
returned
to
the
sender
marked
as
unlawful.
the
section
and
its
remedy
are
almost
precisely
the
same
as
that
provided
in
section
4005
of
the
code.
again,
now
we
numbered
section
3005,
dealing
with
the
use
of
the
mails
to
promote
fraudulent
enterprises,
a
section
which
this
court
has
twice
sustained
most
recently
an
opinion
my
mr.
justice
black
in
donaldson
versus
read
magazine,
333
u.s.
178.
administrative
proceedings
under
section
4006
again
are
governed
by
the
same
regulations
as
are
used
in
broad
proceedings
under
section
4005.
section
4007
governs
preliminary
juridical
relief
for
both
section
4005
and
section
4006.
the
regulations
concerned
that
to
govern
the
administrative
proceedings
are
set
out
and
extend
so
and
in
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement.
under
these
regulations,
the
statute
has
much
narrower
scope
than
might
at
first
appeared
from
its
language.
proceedings
start
when
the
postmaster
general
discovers
that
possibly
obscene
matter
is
being
sold
or
advertised
through
the
mail.
there
is,
that
is
no
obligation
to
submit
any
material
to
him
for
clearance
of
any
kind
or
for
any
other
purpose.
after
complaint
and
notice
a
trial
type
administrative
hearing,
fully
complying
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
held.
in
that
hearing,
the
government
not
only
has
the
burden
of
initiating
it
by
complaint,
but
also
of
establishing
the
obscenity
of
the
materials
or
the
fraudulent
nature
of
the
materials
challenged.
during
the
period
in
which
the
hearings
are
taking
twice,
unless
there
has
been
judicial
relief
under
section
4007,
the
mailer
continuous
to
receive
his
mail
completely
unimpeded.
the
hearing
officer
is
a
regular
departmental
examiner
whose
time
typically
is
principally
devoted
to
contractual
issues
and
other
departmental
matters.
he
is
required
to
write
as
full
an
opinion
on
as
carefully
preserved
a
record
as
any
federal
district
judge
would
be.
the
regulations
urge
speed
in
conducting
the
hearings
and
disposing
of
the
complaint,
but
again
it
is
only
when
a
final
administrative
determination
has
been
made
that
the
item
sold
or
advertised
are
indeed
obscene
that
any
step
can
be
taken
by
the
post
office
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
proceedings
to
interdict
the
defendant’s
mail.
like
these
procedures,
the
order
entered
by
the
postmaster
in
a
section
4006
case
is
identical
in
form
and
in
execution
to
that
which
is
entered
in
fraud
cases
under
section
4005.
it
directs
the
postmaster
to
remove
from
the
mail
and
return
to
the
sender
appropriately
stamped,
all
mail
connected
with
the
items
which
have
been
found
obscene
or
fraudulent
as
the
case
maybe.
it
also
directs
the
postmaster
to
refuse
to
honor
postal
money
orders
drawn
in
payment
for
these
items
or
in
response
to
the
fraudulent
enterprise.
it
maybe
clear
from
the
form
of
address
used
or
from
information
on
the
envelope
that
some
mail
is
unconnected
with
the
adjudicated
items.
that
mail
is
immediately
delivered.
the
rest
generally
speaking,
the
postmaster
cannot
inspect
on
its
own
but
since
the
constitution
and
statutes
protect
first
class
mail
from
such
inspection.
it
is
therefore
held
that
the
post
office
for
inspection
by
the
addressee
and
anything
not
concerned
with
the
adjudicated
items
will
be
delivered
to
him
when
he
inspects
it.
only
mail
which
is
connected
with
the
adjudicated
items
or
which
is
not
inspected
within
a
reasonable
time,
they
are
stamped
and
returned
to
the
sender
marked
as
the
statute
directs.
once
the
section
4006
order
has
become
final
in
administrative
proceedings,
the
order
goes
into
effect
automatically
without
any
need
for
judicial
enforcement.
review
maybe
sought
however
in
district
court.
and
in
order
to
describe
the
effect
that
we
believe
that
review
has
on
the
administrative
order,
it
will
be
helpful
to
turn
now
to
section
4007
which
is
principally
at
issue
here
in
the
second
of
these
two
cases,
the
book
bin
case.
section
4007
provides
for
preliminary
judicial
relief
during
the
pendency
of
administrative
proceedings
under
both
the
fraud
and
the
obscenity
provisions.
it
has
been
prominently
used
in
fraud
cases
and
it
might
be
instructive
to
give
an
example
of
that.
an
advertisement
was
recently
paste
--
placed
in
a
california
newspaper
offering
a
very
low
cost
to
hawaii
vacation
if
the
person
responding
would
only
send
a
$25.00
registration
fee.
the
post
office,
suspecting
fraud
and
able
to
convince
district
judge
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
advertisement
was
fraudulent,
obtained
a
section
4007
order
and
under
that
order
was
able
to
intercept
$250,000.00
in
remittances
that
had
been
sent
to
the
advertiser
who
indeed
did
prove
as
i
understand
to
be
conducting
a
fraudulent
campaign.
similarly
in
a
section
4006
case,
that
is
in
an
obscenity
case
use
of
a
section
4007
order
might
be
proper
or
helpful
in
preventing
widespread
dissemination
of
the
materials
concerned
before
administrative
proceedings
could
be
complete.
procedures
under
section
4007
are
those
which
govern
interim
injunctive
relief
generally
in
federal
courts
and
in
particular
those
specified
by
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
correct
and
of
course
the
same
situation
here.
the
mailer
may
continue
to,
when
i
speak
of
the
mailer,
the
person
against
whom
the
order
is
directed,
may
continue
to
advertise,
and
may
continue
solicit
remittances
and
if
he
ultimately
prevails
well
he
will
receive
all
those
orders
and
remittances.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
any
letter
to
him
would
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
way
as
under
the
statute
except
that
it
wouldn’t
be
returned.
that
is
mail
which
clearly
was
not
connected
with
the
enterprise
would
be
delivered.
a
mail
which
might
be
would
be
held
for
inspection
and
could
be
removed
if
it
was
found
not
to
be
connected.
the
relationship
of
the
statute
to
rule
65,
i
think
is
significant
because
of
that
section's
limitations
on
the
possibility
of
ex
parte
relief.
if
the
government
knows
the
mailer's
address
for
the
purpose
of
getting
relief
under
section
4007,
that
obviously
also
knows
his
address
for
the
purpose
serving
notice
of
those
proceedings.
and
for
these
reasons,
such
proceedings
can
never
be
ex
parte.
in
order
to
justify
interim
relief,
the
government
must
produce
the
material
thought
to
obscene
and
must
satisfy
the
judge
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
is
obscene.
the
interim
relief
granted
as
i
just
explained
is
the
impounding
of
the
incoming
mail
with
delivery
of
mail
which
seems
not
to
be
concerned
with
the
enterprise
in
question
and
possible
delivery
of
other
mail
with
an
inspection
it
is
found
not
to
have
to
do
with
it.
in
addition,
as
in
the
case
of
all
interim
relief
in
this
nature,
there
is
always
available
through
judicial
processes,
the
possibility
of
modification
of
the
order
when
either
delay
or
other
circumstances
would
tend
to
warrant
that
relief.
because
section
4007,
if
i
may
return
now
to
section
4006,
because
section
4007
provides
only
for
impounding
the
mail
during
review
of
an
administrative
order
and
section
4007
specifically
states
that
it
is
preliminary
relief
both
during
the
administrative
proceedings
and
during
any
appeal
there
from.
because
section
4007
provides
only
for
impounding
of
the
mail
during
review
of
the
order,
we
have
interpreted
section
4006
as
subject
to
the
same
limitation.
that
is
if
review
of
the
section
4006
order
is
sought,
the
post
office
can
only
impound
incoming
mail
until
its
order
has
been
judicially
approved.
the
statute
on
its
face
is
subject
to
the
contrary
interpretation
and
indeed
if
no
review
were
sought,
the
post
office
believes
that
the
section
4006
orders
immediately
effective.
but
we
think
the
necessary
consequence
of
section
4007
is
at
least
that
where
review
of
the
section
4006
order
is
sought.
that
has
the
effect
of
transmuting
the
relief
for
the
interim
to
simple
impoundment
only
when
judicial
approval
has
been
obtained
were
review
is
sought,
could
the
post
office
begin
to
return
mail
to
the
sender
stamped
as
the
statute
directs.
and
indeed
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
one
of
the
possibilities
open
in
this
case,
we
don’t
urge
it,
but
we
don’t
believe
it
would
wrench
the
statute
if
it
we’re
necessary,
would
be
to
give
an
even
more
restrictive
interpretation
to
section
4006
and
hold
that
where
review
is
sought
no
effect
could
be
given
to
section
4006
order
so
that
interim
relief
would
depend
entirely
on
the
availability
and
the
obtaining
of
judicial
relief
under
section
4007.
turning
very
briefly
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
appellee
publishes
advertises
and
sells
through
the
mails
a
variety
of
magazines
to
the
character
described
in
our
brief.
in
the
fall
of
1968,
the
postmaster
general
become
aware
of
seven
of
these
in
particular
and
directed
that
section
4006
proceedings
be
brought.
a
complaint
was
filed
and
an
administrative
hearing
set
for
december
3,
1968.
on
the
same
day
as
the
hearing
december
3,
the
post
office
secured
the
temporary
restraining
order
under
section
4007
specifically
limited
to
the
seven
magazines
charged
on
the
basis
of
the
finding
of
probable
cause
to
believe
them
obscene.
on
december
31,
the
judicial
officer
filed
the
length
of
the
opinion,
set
out
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
and
our
jurisdictional
statement
finding
that
each
of
the
magazines
was
obscene.
appellee
then
brought
this
injunctive
action
to
bar
enforcement
of
the
resulting
administrative
order.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
held
section
4006
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
sole
stated
ground
of
decision
was
that
the
statute
failed
to
meet
the
standard
set
by
this
court
in
freedman
versus
maryland
380
u.s.
51.
on
the
government’s
appeal,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
march
2,
of
this
year.
now
i
think
there
are
three
principle
points
to
which
i
have
to
address
myself.
one
of
them
not
decided
by
either
of
the
courts
below,
but
suggested
i
think
more
or
less
inevitably
by
intervening
decisions
which
as
this
court
knows
we
have
appealed
here.
and
that
is
the
question
extensively
settled
in
roth
versus
united
states
whether
indeed
the
congress
can
regulate
the
use
of
mails
for
the
sending
of
obscene
matter.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
particular
procedures,
administrative
procedures
in
this
case
as
i
mentioned
this
case,
the
mailbox
case
deals
only
with
section
4006
and
when
i
refer
to
section
4007
any
discussion
of
it,
i
think
it
would
appropriately
deferred
to
the
book
bin
case
whether
the
administrative
procedures
for
determining
obscenity
are
appropriate
under
this
court’s
decision
in
freedman
versus
maryland,
now
with
the
sole
grounded
decision
below.
the
third
point
which
was
a
grounded
decision
in
the
book
bin
case
is
the
issue
whether
the
orders
which
maybe
obtained
as
relief
are
a
proper
form
of
relief
in
light
of
this
court’s
decisions
and
in
particular
decision
lamont
versus
the
postmaster
general.
on
the
question
of
authority
to
close
the
mails
to
this
kind
of
matter,
the
general
authority
of
congress
over
the
mails
is
firmly
established
in
as
i
mentioned
before
precisely
similar
circumstances
except
that
it
--
the
occasion
was
fraud
rather
than
obscenity.
this
court
has
upheld
by
a
substantial
margin,
precisely
the
same
form
of
relief,
that
is
the
donaldson
case
which
we
discuss
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
but
it
might
be
helpful
i
think
to
simply
read
one
short
passage
from
the
opinion
appearing
at
page
190
of
the
report
which
it
seems
to
us
is
equally
applicable
here.
all
the
forgoing
statutes
and
others
which
need
not
be
referred
to
manifest
a
purpose
of
congress
to
utilize
its
powers
to
protect
people
against
fraud
in
that
case,
this
government
power
has
always
been
recognized
in
this
country
and
it’s
firmly
established.
the
particular
statutes
here
attacked
have
been
regularly
enforced
by
the
executive
officers
in
the
courts
for
more
than
half
a
century.
they
are
now
part
and
parcel
of
our
governmental
fabric.
the
same
maybe
said
with
equal
strength
i
think
of
the
obscenity
statutes
which
were
upheld
not
six
years
later,
not
this
particular
statute,
but
other
statutes
dealing
with
the
government’s
authority
over
the
mails
in
the
roth
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1950,
two
years
after
the
decision
in
donaldson
and
on
the
map,
excuse
me
on
the
model,
on
the
model
of
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
obviously
mr.
justice
blackmun
it
would
depend
somewhat
on
the
character
of
the
affirmance.
i
think
there
is
a
particular
risk
in
that
direction
under
section
4007
which
treats
both
statutes
and
the
objections
to
what
seems
to
me
to
run
equally
to
the
fraud
statute
as
to
here.
the
court
maybe
able
to
discern
some
differences
between
fraud
and
obscenity,
the
government
does
not.
other
than
that,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
certainly
yes.
the
interests
of
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
mails
have
sometimes
been
questioned.
i
realize
that
there
is
a
position
which
now
has
substantial
adherence
in
the
court
that
the
federal
government
has
somewhat
less
interest
in
regulation
of
these
matters
than
perhaps
the
states
have.
but
i
think
it’s
fair
to
observe
that
that
position
is
always
been
articulated
in
terms
of
a
level
of
obscenity
rather
than
the
question
whether
the
regulation
is
not
possible,
whether
the
materials
in
question
must
be
hardcore
or
not
which
might
be
insisted
upon
to
the
federal
government
and
not
for
the
states
and
not
whether
a
particular
form
of
regulation
would
or
would
not
be
possible.
and
i
think
it's
incumbent
on
me
to
point
out
that
the
consequences
for
the
government
and
for
the
government’s
posture
here
are
not
at
all
abstract
as
the
court
knows,
use
of
the
postal
services
which
is
a
government
enterprise
is
a
very
valuable
tool
for
distributors
through
the
mail
and
i
think
anytime
that
the
government
becomes
involved
in
this
enterprise
by
lending
this
aid,
there
must
be
some
appearance
to
the
people
of
the
country
that
this
legitimizes
in
some
sense,
the
enterprise
which
is
taking
place.
and
if
indeed
it
is
an
illegitimate
enterprise
one
which
the
government
has
a
right
to
interfere
with,
why
then
the
government
cannot
tolerate,
indeed
will
not
tolerate
that
situation.
it’s
not
irrelevant
in
these
circumstances
that
these
mailers
have
a
claim
not
simply
to
pay
their
own
way,
but
to
have
the
government
pay
part
of
the
way
for
them
through
use
of
second
or
fourth
class
mailing
privileges.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
believe
though
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
this
case
must
be
decided
on
the
proposition
that
any
material
could
be
sent.
if
i
may
turn
now
to
stanley
versus
georgia,
only
briefly
i
--
as
the
court
knows
expect
to
be
back
on
that
question
later
on,
but
the
suggestion
has
been
made
now.
well,
here
we
have
some
transactions
that
take
place
through
the
first
class
mails,
sealed
mails,
isn’t
this
a
special
situation
in
which
the
government
could
not
interfere.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
publications
that
might
be
so
sent.
the
remittances
to
--
this
particular
statute
interferes
that
with
the
remittances
which
are
received
by
the
publishers
and
those
would
generally
be
sent
by
this
first
class
mail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
the
first
class
mail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
in
referring
to
that
i
was
simply
trying
to
lay
some
groundwork
for
the
proposition
established
by
roth
but
that
to
be
called
into
question
by
stanley
that
indeed
there
is
some
interest
in
regulating
in
this
area
that
the
government
had
some
very
substantial
interest
in
dealing
with
this
field.m
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
also
true.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
any
--
i
think
any
sort
of
fraud
that’s
dealt
with
through
the
mail
there’s
also
a
section
which
was
initially
the
sections
sought
to
--
that
sought
to
deal
with
obscenity
simply
because
that
was
the
way
that
the
purveyors
of
this
stuff
originally
conducted
their
business
having
to
do
with
the
use
of
false
names
and
addresses.
i
might
point
out
again
and
it’s
the
special
character
of
the
mails
that
even
if
one
gave
stanley
its
broadest
reading,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
it
necessarily
foreclosed
the
type
of
relief
which
the
statute
embodies
in
that
one
cannot
know
as
one
can
where
material
is
sold
over
the
counter.
one
cannot
know
whether
the
sale
involved
is
indeed
to
an
adult
or
consensual
of
the
two
parameters
of
the
stanley
opinion
on
which
a
considerable
weight
has
been
placed.
but
going
beyond
that,
i
think
it’s
sufficient
to
observe
at
this
point
that
the
stanley
opinion
carefully
preserved
the
right
of
state
and
federal
government
to
proceed
against
commercial
enterprises
in
this
field
and
it
is
not
hard
to
discern
in
that
opinion
which
cites
the
first
amendment,
nonetheless
a
considerable
degree
of
emphasis
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
on
conceded
notions
of
privacy
which
are
especially
appropriate
there.
indeed
as
we
suggest,
it
seems
to
us
more
appropriate
to
deal
with
stanley
as
a
case
imposing
a
disability
on
the
government
because
of
the
particular
dangers
of
the
situation
with
which
the
georgia
statute
in
that
case
attempted
to
deal
than
a
case
which
recognizes
any
kind
of
right
to
receive
on
the
part
of
the
individual
involved
in
which
might
therefore
be
used
as
a
tool
as
indeed
the
purveyors
of
this
material
are
seeking
to
use
it
for
expanding
the
area
in
which
they
may
operate
free
of
government
interference
or
supervision.
turning
to
the
freedman
question,
it
seems
to
us
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief
that
this
case
is
entirely
different
in
the
situation
which
confronted
this
court
in
freedman
versus
maryland.
if
i
may
recount
that
briefly,
that
case
was
concerned
with
movies.
the
law
before
the
court
require
that
anyone
who
wish
to
show
a
movie
in
maryland
before
he
could
show
it,
he
must
submit
it
to
a
board
of
censors
and
that
board
would
then
decide
whether
or
not
he
would
be
permitted
to
show
it
in
the
state.
there
was
no
particular
certainty
about
how
long
that
would
take
about
that
process.
there
was
no
particular
certainty
about
how
long
it
might
take
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
it
reviewed.
here
entirely
in
contrast,
these
magazines
were
being
advertised
and
sent
through
the
mails
for
the
moment,
we
may
assume
at
the
moment
that
they
came
off
the
press.
there
was
no
governmental
interference,
no
governmental
clearance
of
any
kind.
similarly,
the
board
which
reviewed
the
movies
in
freedman,
was
a
board
which
did
nothing
else.
here,
the
matter
goes
to
a
federal
hearing
examiner
or
judicial
officer,
someone
within
the
administrative
process
to
be
sure
about
the
person
who
as
many
of
the
insulations
of
which
judges
enjoy,
who
sees
a
broad
range
of
problems
come
before
him.
one
of
whom
it
certainly
could
not
be
said
as
the
court
remarked
that
the
board
in
freedman
versus
maryland
that
his
business
is
to
censor.
there
is
a
necessity
here
that
the
government
go
forward
by
filing
a
complaint.
there
is
no
burden
of
going
forward
on
the
part
of
the
mailer.
there
is
a
necessity
here
that
the
government
prove
that
the
matter
is
obscene.
there
is
no
burden
to
be
carried
by
the
person
using
the
mails.
indeed,
the
only
point
at
which
the
appellee
is
here
have
been
able
to
rely
on
freedman
as
in
a
singular
question
of
appealing.
it
is
true
that
the
section
4006
order
goes
into
effect
automatically
and
if
they
don’t
appeal,
then
it
will
have
effect
on
them
and
to
that
extent
it
can
be
said
that
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
require
judicial
involvement.
but
that
we
submit
is
no
different
from
the
possibility
of
default
which
always
inheres
in
any
kind
of
process
because
every
incentive
under
the
statute
is
for
these
individuals
to
appeal
to
the
courts.
if
they
do
so,
at
the
least,
under
the
reading
of
section
4006,
which
we
consider
mandatory,
they
will
have
preserved
their
mail
for
the
possibility
that
on
judicial
review
it
will
be
found
to
have
been
not
obscene
and
during
that
period
of
course
they
are
free
to
go
forward
and
to
continue
to
solicit
remittances
for
these
magazines,
remittances
which
they
know
if
they
succeed
they
will
receive
and
if
they
don’t
succeed,
i
suppose
in
this
line
of
enterprise
that
that
might
even
be
some
kind
of
a
badge
on
the
sleeve
as
well.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
only
burden
is
the
burden
to
file
an
appeal.
there
are
possible
issues
of
timeliness,
but
as
i
shall
discuss
in
the
book
bin
case,
i
think
those
are
amply
dealt
with
by
court's
powers
to
modify
section
4007
relief.
certainly,
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
on
appeal,
will
the
sender
carry
some
kind
of
burden
of
showing
that
its
material
was
not
obscene,
that
the
post
office
decided
the
case
wrongly.
at
least
as
long
as
this
court’s
present
practice
continues,
i
think
it
must
be
clear
to
any
court
in
this
country
that
they
may
not
accept
the
judgment
which
someone
else
may
have
made
about
whether
material
is
obscene
or
not.
that
they
must
themselves
inspect
and
consider
the
material
in
light
of
the
record
which
has
been
made,
yes,
but
it’s
a
full
record
with
transcript
and
everything
else
which
could
be
hoped
for
and
must
themselves
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
constitution
protects
it
or
does
not
do
so.
and
as
long
as
that
line
of
cases
persists
certainly
then
the
answer
is
the
only
burden
on
the
appellees
in
a
case
like
this
is
the
burden
of
filing
an
appeal
and
indeed
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
footnote
22
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
that’s
true.
i
think
that
gets
to
the
other
third
aspect
of
the
case
what
i
might
call
the
lamont
issues
although
i
don’t
think
it’s
precisely
that
scope
of
relief
as
distinct
from
a
question
of
the
regularity
of
the
proceedings
and
i
have
been
dealing
with
freedman
as
directed
principally
at
questions
of
proceedings
in
whether
the
proceedings
are
themselves
adequate.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
just
--mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
obviously,
this
case
concerns
the
same
legal
questions
and
so
i
will
be
making
a
continuous
argument
in
that
sense,
but
if
i
may
just
a
moment,
correct
a
couple
that
i
think
a
factual
overstatement
regarding
the
case
just
concluded.
my
understanding
is
that
the
stays
which
are
in
effect
concerning
the
mail
received
by
the
mailbox
in
this
case
were
consented
to
or
at
least
not
opposed
by
mr.
fleishman
on
behalf
of
his
client
and
--
well,
he
may
have
given
a
contrary
impression.
the
original
orders
in
this
case
came
on
as
a
result
of
unsolicited
advertisement
which
the
post
inspectors
received
from
the
mailbox.
now
proceeding
to
the
book
bin
then
i
think
my
statement
may
be
brief.
appellee
advertises
and
sells
through
the
mail
and
like
the
mailbox,
a
substantial
number
of
publications
of
the
character
suggested
by
the
advertising
exhibit
reproduced
at
pages
58
and
59
of
the
record.
a
section
4006
proceeding
was
brought
against
the
book
bin
alleging
that
one
of
these
publications
entitled
novels
of
france
was
obscene
and
on
june
6,
1969,
the
government
sought
a
section
4007
protective
order
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
appellees
counterclaimed
for
an
injunction
forbidding
enforcement
of
sections
4006
and
4007.
a
three-judge
district
court
was
convened
and
granted
the
counterclaim.
the
court
found
that
the
procedures
for
examining
mail
possibly
connected
with
the
challenged
publication
were
overbroad
and
that
the
procedures
generally
failed
to
meet
the
standards
of
freedman
versus
maryland.
on
the
government's
appeal,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
march
2
of
this
year.
if
i
may
go
--
turn
first
and
i
realize
mr.
justice
harlan
that
your
question
regarding
the
scope
of
relief
in
this
case
remains
open
and
is
perhaps
the
most
serious
of
the
questions
in
this
case,
but
i
do
want
first
to
examine
briefly
the
other
procedures
of
section
4007,
the
operative
procedures
as
it
were.
the
procedures
that
put
in
an
operation
because
the
scope
of
relief
question
is
really
shared
with
section
4006.
section
4007
as
i
stated
at
the
beginning
of
the
prior
case
is
basically
a
reference
to
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
entitles
the
government
to
get
interim
relief
against
the
distribution
of
the
magazines
of
this
type
or
against
fraudulent
enterprises
and
circumstances
in
which
such
relief
could
be
obtained
under
rule
65.
that
means
among
other
things
that
the
proceedings
cannot
be
ex-parte
and
therefore,
the
consideration,
which
principally
i
think
animated
this
court's
decision
or
the
concern
i
suppose,
which
principally
animated
this
court's
decision
in
kingsley
books
and
subsequent
opinions
construing
that
case
as
absent.
in
addition,
there
is
the
necessity
of
showing
a
probable
cause
in
two
respects.
first
to
believe
that
the
magazines
are
obscene
and
that
would
be
a
judicial
finding
and
second
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
indeed,
the
government
will
be
irreparably
injured,
that
there
is
some
need
for
emergency
relief
and
kingsley
books
spoke
to
both
of
those
issues.
the
court
said
at
page
440
of
volume
354
of
the
report,
“authorization
of
an
injunction
pendente
lite
as
part
of
this
scheme
during
the
period
within
which
the
issue
of
obscenity
must
be
promptly
tried
and
adjudicated
in
an
adversary
proceeding
for
which
adequate
notice,
judicial
hearing
and
fair
determination
are
assured
is
a
safeguard
against
frustration
of
the
public
interest
in
effectuating
the
judicial
condemnation
of
obscene
matter.”
it
is
a
break
on
the
temptation
to
exploit
a
filthy
business
offered
by
the
limited
hazards
of
piecemeal
prosecutions
sale
by
sale
of
a
publication
already
condemned
as
obscene.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
concurrence
characterizing
it
accurately
in
his
dissent
rather
in
quantity
of
books,
stated
the
grounds
that
were
important
to
that
decision
and
into
the
distinction
of
that
decision
that
was
made
by
this
court
in
the
market
case
--
excuse
me,
on
the
marcus
case.
first,
that
the
court
could
exercise
an
independent
check
on
the
judgment
of
the
prosecuting
authority
at
the
point
before
any
restraint
took
place,
second
that
the
restraints
ran
only
against
the
named
publication,
third,
that
no
extensive
restraints
were
imposed
before
an
adversary
proceeding
and
fourth,
that
the
new
york
code
required
decision
within
two
days
of
the
trial
on
the
obscenity
question.
now,
the
only
issue
regarding
those
four
statements
in
this
case
i
believe
is
the
matter
of
time
and
it
is
the
government's
position
basically
that
that
question
is
adequately
controlled
by
the
power
which
a
court
of
equity
always
retains
to
modify
its
judgment
when
subsequent
events
show
that
indeed,
the
person
against
whom
a
temporary
restraint
runs
is
being
improperly
or
unfairly
injured
by
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings
by
the
continuation
of
the
relief
during
a
period
of
undue
delay.
in
that
respect,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
some
confusion
which
i
think
may
exist
regarding
the
relationship
that
we
see
between
section
4007
and
4006.
4006
in
no
event
takes
effect
before
a
final
administrative
decision
has
been
reached.
once
a
final
administrative
decision
has
been
reached,
it
does
take
effect
of
its
own
force
and
without
need
for
enforcement.
the
person
against
whom
the
order
is
entered
may
then
seek
review
as
was
done
in
these
cases
essentially
and
the
issue
then
is
what
is
the
affect
of
that
petition
for
review.
the
government's
position,
principle
position
is
that
that
petition
for
review
operates
to
convert
the
section
4006
order
into
what
is
in
effect
a
section
4007
order,
an
order
impounding
the
mail
for
the
duration
of
the
proceedings
to
challenge
the
administrative
decision.
so
that
there
would
be
no
return
of
the
mail
once
an
appeal
had
been
filed.
now,
there
might
be
in
the
intervening
period
some
slight
length
of
time
during
which
mail
would
be
returned
or
would
in
that
sense
and
some
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
during
that
brief
period,
the
length
of
that
period
is
in
counsel's
control
and
i
am
sure
that
if
representations
were
made
that
an
appeal
would
be
taken
that
an
appropriate
stay
would
be
issued.
it
takes
time
to
transmit
these
orders
after
all
from
washington
where
they
are
entered
to
the
postmasters
out
in
the
field
and
if
such
a
stay
wouldn't
be
entered,
i'm
sure
this
court
and
other
courts
would
be
quick
to
grant
one.
so
that
that
is
the
necessary
affect
of
an
appeal.
and
now,
we
say
in
addition
although
we
don't
urge
it
but
if
the
court
feels
that
incumbent
upon
it,
it
would
not
disturb
the
statutory
scheme
in
view
of
the
history
of
section
4007
to
say
that
the
appeal
has
a
more
radical
effect,
that
is
that
it
suspends
any
impact
whatever
of
the
administrative
order
and
leaves
the
government
completely
dependent
on
it's
ability
to
get
a
judicial
order
under
section
4007.
so
that
under
that
second
reading,
i
think
you
were
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
in
your
question
that
there
would
be
no
burden
so
far
as
section
4006
is
concerned
on
the
person
subject
to
the
order
other
than
the
burden
of
filing
his
appeal
and
seeing
to
it
that
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
now,
i'm
talking
about
section
4007
and
which
need
not
--
the
government
i
think
need
not
wait.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
the
government
cannot
invoke
section
4007
before
there
has
been
an
administrative
decision.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
keep
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
and
therefore,
i
think
it's
certainly
appropriate
for
the
government
to
seek
such
an
order
as
it
did
in
the
mailbox
case
when
the
hearing
begins.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
of
course
will
be
before
the
decision
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
in
the
particular
case.
it
was
a
month
before
the
decision.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
so
that
there
will
be
possibly
a
period
of
time
during
which
there
is
not
yet
any
administrative
decision.
there
could
not
yet
be
any
administrative
restraint,
but
there
maybe
a
judicial
order
outstanding
which
does
impose
a
restraint
of
impounding
the
mail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
course
that's
appealable
and
maybe
stayed.
it
requires
as
i
have
said
before
that
the
judge
have
the
specific
material
before
him
and
that
he
inspect
them
and
determine
that
there
is
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
are
obscene.
and
indeed,
that
was
precisely
the
procedure.
if
the
court
will
see
we
have
reproduced
it
at
the
rear
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
preliminary
injunction
which
were
in
fact
entered
in
the
mailbox
case
and
the
court
will
see
that
they
refer
specifically
to
the
seven
magazines
which
were
at
issue
here.
and
i
may
say
too,
kingsley
itself
is
probably
sufficient
authority
or
a
sufficient
demonstration
of
the
need
for
this
sort
of
pendente
lite
relief,
if
it
were
necessary
to
give
anymore,
the
question
arose
with
regard
to
the
specific
provision
of
section
4006.
before
passage
of
section
4007,
the
postmaster
general
attempted
to
forge
his
own
impoundment
authority.
he
was
ultimately
unsuccessful
in
the
court
of
appeal,
but
in
the
interim
a
motion
for
stay
came
before
mr.
justice
douglas.
he
wrote
a
lengthy
opinion
which
is
reported
and
commented
on
by
the
appellees
here.
what's
notable
about
that
action
i
think
is
that
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
impoundment
that
he
acknowledged
that
there
are
many
situations.
one
of
the
burdens
of
litigation
may
be
putting
things
aside
for
the
time
in
order
to
preserve
the
status
quo
and
that
was
standard
versus
olsen
which
is
reported
in
the
supreme
court
report
volume
74,
at
page
768.
so
as
i
say,
the
principal
things
to
be
said
here
are
that
there
is
this
need
to
--
that
the
government
must
show
probable
cause.
it
must
show
a
need
for
emergency
relief.
there
is
complete
judicial
control
over
the
period
of
time
during
which
the
order
remains
in
effect.
it
is
at
once
appealable
on
the
issues
of
probable
cause
and
need
for
emergency
relief.
there
is
the
constant
possibility
of
modification
and
we
submit
that
all
of
this
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
the
correctness
of
the
procedure
even
if
what
were
involved
was
some
form
of
censorship,
but
of
course
that's
not
the
case.
it's
a
simple
postponement.
the
mailbox
man
for
all
we
know,
or
the
book
bin
may
and
for
all
we
know
has
continued
to
solicit
orders
and
those
orders
come
in
and
are
kept
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
period
of
time,
they
may
indeed
be
received.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
mailbox
or
the
book
bin
from
re-circulating
their
lists
with
a
letter
saying
“perhaps
you
didn't
receive
some
orders
that
you
sent
to
list.
we
want
you
to
know
we
are
in
this
trouble.”
while
in
many
industries,
advertisement
of
troubles
like
that
might
not
be
to
commercial
advantage,
it
seems
to
me
at
least
conceivable
that
in
this
industry,
it
would
be.
there
is
a
further
point
that
mr.
justice
harlan
has
averted
to
in
some
of
his
decisions
and
that
is
that
there
is
involved
in
these
materials
here
unlike
movies
that
communicate
ideas
or
political
speeches
that
have
a
certain
timeliness
still
in
the
materials
of
the
sort
involved
in
this
case
really
carry
no
urgency
of
that
sort.
whatever,
they
are
essentially
timeless
as
the
court
knows
from
the
descriptions
of
the
materials.
there
is
against
that
balance
to
the
need
of
the
government
for
relief
if
the
scheme
of
the
statute
is
to
be
upheld.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
what
i've
called
the
lamont
issues
which
i
think
i
would
agree
were
--
are
the
more
troublesome
in
the
case.
still
it
does
seem
to
me
that
they
were
principally
settled
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
donaldson
because
as
to
this
question,
the
way
in
which
an
order
interferes
or
may
interfere
with
a
person's
incoming
mail,
it
seems
to
me
the
effect
of
this
order
is
indistinguishable
from
the
orders
which
were
--
from
the
mail
which
was
involved
in
the
donaldson
case.
as
the
court
may
recall
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
target
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
only
mail
that
this
order
operates
on
is
incoming
mail
are
the
target
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
then
i
should
say
directly
operates
upon.
it
doesn't
prevent
them
from
getting
it
from
some
other
source
or
at
their
neighborhood
bookstore.
of
course
it
doesn't
in
that
sense
suppress
or
remove
the
materials
from
the
market.
it
does
remove
them
from
this
one
particular
market.
in
this
respect,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
order
is
essentially
of
the
same
impact
and
it's
essentially
indistinguishable
from
the
situation
in
donaldson.
i
might
remind
the
court
and
that
while
it
maybe
unusual,
nonetheless
in
donaldson
the
court
was
dealing
indeed
with
a
magazine.
fax
magazine,
reed
magazine
and
these
are
magazines
with
subscription
lists.
these
were
magazines
which
undoubtedly
had
persons
writing
to
them
for
proper
purposes.
as
the
case
started
out,
the
order
entered
against
the
magazines
in
question
was
quite
broad.
the
court
was
evidently,
properly
i
would
say
alarmed
at
the
breath
of
that
order.
it
heard
argument
once
and
then
set
the
case
for
re-argument
specifically
on
the
question
of
the
breath
of
order.
in
the
interim,
the
order
was
modified
and
the
court
then
concluded
that
with
that
modification,
a
modification
which
essentially
narrowed
the
orders
so
that
its
predictable
impact
was
principally
on
the
transactions
in
question
that
the
order
was
not
overbroad
and
indeed
was
proper.
the
problems
here
stem
from
the
necessity
of
honoring
the
privacy
of
the
mail
in
the
sense
that
the
government
may
not
open
a
person's
domestic
first
class
mail
out
of
his
presence
and
that
means
that
if
the
statutory
remedy
is
to
be
applied,
it
must
either
be
applied
against
all
mail
incoming
to
the
person
which
we
don't
assert
would
be
proper
and
do
not
attempt
or
there
must
be
some
provision
made
for
an
inspection
procedure
and
the
provision
for
an
inspection
procedure
is
what
at
issue
here.
i
don't
think
it
is
irrelevant
to
point
out
that
here
as
distinct
from
a
case
like
lamont,
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
innocent
party
whom
the
government
presumes
to
protect.
but
we
are
dealing
with
an
individual
who
has
either
been
adjudicated
or
whom
it
has
been
adjudicated
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
using
the
mails
for
an
illegal
improper
purpose
and
it
is
upon
the
basis
of
that
adjudication,
a
specific
adjudication
directed
to
him,
directed
after
adversary
proceedings
fully
consonant
with
due
process
that
this
remedy
is
applied.
now,
the
order
of
course
is
a
restraint
in
some
respects
but
that
is
a
restraint
which
can
readily
be
reduced
in
its
impact.
commercial
publishing
houses,
commercial
mailers
regularly
use
special
forms
of
address
in
connection
with
their
order
blanks.
where
that
is
done
only
envelopes
addressed
to
that
special
form
of
address
are
intercepted
and
detained
or
returned
as
the
case
maybe
and
again,
that
was
the
situation
in
donaldson.
as
a
practical
reality,
there
are
not
terribly
many
situations
where
an
individual
would
receive
private
mail
or
anything
of
that
sort
at
a
commercial
address
which
would
be
used
in
this
kind
of
situation.
there
are
for
the
specific
provisions
made
for
“for
waiting”
mail
without
interference
which
appears
from
its
cover
not
to
be
related
to
the
specific
publications
which
have
been
adjudicated.
and
in
sum
as
i
think
is
demonstrated
by
the
donaldson
opinion,
there
maybe
a
problem
in
particular
cases
about
an
order
being
overbroad.
i
think
there
is
not
a
problem
about
the
statute
necessarily
being
so.
even
the
inspection
itself
when
it
occurs
i
might
point
out,
it
need
not
and
in
fact
probably
is
not
in
the
realities
of
this
situation
to
be
a
reading
of
the
person's
mail
as
such.
we
know
that
the
way
these
publishing
houses
operate
is
on
a
cash
basis.
they
do
not
accept
orders
cod.
consequently,
any
letter
which
when
opening
was
found
to
include
no
check
would
immediately
be
a
candidate
for
passage
on.
there's
no
necessity
to
see
whether
it's
an
order
or
not
what
knows
it
on
the
basis
of
this
type
of
commercial
reality
or
usually,
there
will
be
order
blanks
or
something
else
of
the
sort
which
would
also
serve
in
identifying
function.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
are
some
issues
of
fact
that
might
be
explored.
there
maybe
some
questions
of
social
utility,
maybe
special
evidence
that
could
be
introduced
at
one
way
or
another
on
various,
the
elements
to
the
court's
obscenity
standards
as
they
have
evolved.
but
i
must
say
that
certainly
in
this
court's
practice,
it
does
seem
to
come
principally
down
to
a
matter
of
inspecting
the
materials
themselves
and
to
the
extent
that
that
is
the
test,
of
course,
there
s
no
difference.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
and
i
think
any
conscientious
judge
in
that
situation
would
take
more
time
rather
than
issue
the
order.
i
might
say
that
again,
that
there
are
substantial
interests
on
the
government's
side
warranting
this
procedure.
whatever
certificates
of
age
there
maybe
in
the
mail,
it
is
nonetheless
impossible
to
know
whether
in
fact
the
person
is
saying
that
he
is
21,
is
21.
if
you
sell
this
material
over
the
counter,
you
can
at
least
make
some
obvious
sorts
of
differentiations
along
that
score.
there
is
the
need
i
think
recognized
by
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
memoirs
for
cooperating
in
the
sense,
in
a
sense
with
the
states
who
are
inhibiting
the
spread
of
this
material
which
all
states
of
the
union
find
obnoxious
and
within
constitutional
bounds
properly
so.
and
as
kingsley
itself
recognized,
that
cannot
effectively
be
done
without
some
form
of
restraint.
there
is
the
matter
of
post
office
involvement
indeed
with
what
is
in
offense
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
time
for
the
prosecution
of
a
criminal
case
again,
there's
a
time
during
which
the
material
may
continue
to
be
sent.
in
sum,
i
believe
this
is
a
remedy
which
is
as
narrow
as
possible
under
the
exigent
circumstances
of
the
act,
something
which
this
court
indicated
in
the
burrstone
case,
it
would
consider
as
a
proper
consideration
in
passing
unconstitutionality
of
regulation
in
this
field.
a
few
concluding
observations
that
i'd
like
to
make
regarding
this
court's
decision
in
stanley
and
the
meaning
that
ought
to
be
given
to
it.
i
think
the
government's
approach
or
understanding
of
that
opinion
maybe
reflected
not
only
in
griswold
versus
connecticut
but
perhaps
better
than
elsewhere
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
poe
versus
ullman.
we
are
not
presented
simply
with
the
moral
judgment
to
be
passed
on
as
an
abstract
proposition.
a
secular
state
is
not
an
examiner
of
consciences
and
must
operate
in
the
realm
of
behavior
of
overt
actions
and
where
it
does
so
operate,
not
only
the
underlying
moral
purpose
of
it's
operations
but
also
the
choice
of
means
becomes
relevant
to
any
constitutional
judgment
on
what
is
done.
i
believe
that
stanley
was
a
decision
about
the
choice
of
means
for
regulating
obscenity
and
as
such,
the
government
has
no
qualms
with
it.
i
do
not
believe
as
the
court
said.
it
was
not
that
the
opinion
was
amended
in
any
way
to
interfere
with
general
government
regulation
in
this
particular
area,
but
someone
suggested
that
the
roth
opinion
has
proved
the
debacle.
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
remembering
back
to
what
was
available
on
the
news
stands
and
through
the
mails
in
1957
in
considering
what
is
there
now
that
is
was
a
debacle
at
least
for
anyone
on
the
side
of
the
fence
represented
by
the
person
who
made
the
observation
nor
do
i
think
that
the
issue
with
social
value
can
be
equated
with
monetary
value.
no
one
suggested
and
surely
the
authors
of
the
roth
opinion
understood
that
obscenity
was
handed
out
for
no
compensation
because
people
wouldn't
pay
for
it.
obviously
it
has
some
social
value
in
that
sense,
but
i
do
not
think
any
value
which
has
been
suggested
for
it
amounts
to
the
type
of
value
which
the
court
was
discussing
in
roth,
a
value
connected
with
ideas.
counsel
has
made
a
great
deal
of
our
brief
in
rowan.
those
quotes
were
taken
widely
out
of
context.
they
were
principally
quotations
which
the
government
itself
had
made
in
its
brief.
one
for
example
was
from
our
statement
of
facts
at
page
six
where
we
quoted
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
who
was
explaining
his
bill
and
other
was
from
the
harvard
law
review
and
so
forth.
the
principle
thing
to
be
noted
about
the
government's
position
in
that
case
is
that
that
deals
with
the
statute
which
has
much
wider
impact
than
on
materials
which
this
court
has
held
may
constitutionally
be
designated
obscene.
and
in
that
wider
area
where
the
individual
may
very
well
believe
and
many
individuals
do
believe
that
materials
this
court
has
held
are
not
obscene
and
nonetheless
objectionable.
the
mail
holder
is
given
a
quite
proper
control
over
what
comes
into
his
home.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
judicial
officer
is
the
judicial
officer
of
the
post
office.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
a
position
very
much
like
similar
positions
in
the
department
of
the
agriculture
and
other
places.
it's
defined
by
the
postal
laws
section
308
of
title
39
shall
perform
such
quasi
judicial
duties
that
the
postmaster
general
may
designate
and
he
is
the
agency
for
the
purposes
of
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
passes
on.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
more
than
a
trial
examiner
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
serve
the
same.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
a
censor
deals
strictly
with
these
materials.
80%
of
the
judicial
officer's
time
is
spent
passing
on
contractual
disputes
involving
the
building
of
post
officers.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
that's
a
lot
of
what
he
does,
yes.
he
passes
on
issues
of
second
class
mail
ability,
any
administrative
dispute
that
may
come
up
within
the
department
and
have
to
be
settled.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
precisely.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
precisely.
finally,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
say
that
the
government
does
indeed
assert
that
it
has
the
right
not
to
have
to
deliver
through
its
mails
some
of
the
materials
that
people
assert
the
right
to
send
through
it.
that
may
ultimately
be
what's
at
issue
on
this
case,
although
i
thought
it
had
been
settled
by
roth,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
overriding
interest
here
because
carriage
through
the
mails
is
not
simply
a
neutral
act.
it
involves
the
government
in
this
business
and
in
some
sense
puts
a
stamp
of
government
approval
if
not
government
subsidy
on
it.
that
is
why
i'm
quoting
from
an
editorial
in
the
london
times
which
was
written
on
a
somewhat
different
issue,
but
i
think
it's
perfectly
apt.
“that
is
why
those
who
were
of
the
opinion
that
material
passes
the
balance
of
decency
are
justified
in
denouncing
it
in
circumstances
like
these,
it
is
not
because
they
personally
are
affronted,
they
need
not
be
so
but
because
it
shifts
the
limits
of
the
publicly
permissible
sexual
display
and
shifts
them
in
a
direction
that
they
have
reason
to
believe
it
is
hurtful
to
the
values
they
uphold
and
to
the
well
being
of
their
society.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
have
only
three
very
short
points
to
make.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
first
is
this
was
as
i
think
counsel
just
stated,
a
test
case
and
as
test
cases
sometimes
do
it
had
many
flaws.
it
was
brought
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
kind
of
conflict
with
the
proceedings
on
the
west
coast,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
evaluated
as
an
ordinary
case
of
how
the
department
would
proceed
under
the
statute.
the
second
point
i
should
make
in
connection
with
this
issue
of
time
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
question
whether
that
was
a
case
in
which
had
it
come
to
an
issue,
the
government
could
have
demonstrated
that
it
was
entitled
to
the
extraordinary
relief
of
section
4007
is
not
an
issue
which
was
decided,
and
should
not
i
think
be
assumed
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
the
nature
of
the
magazine
and
the
nature
of
the
prosecution,
i
suppose
that
a
showing
that
four
months
had
elapsed
and
the
government
hadn't
shown
that
there
was
any
emergency
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
would
tend
to
persuade
you
that
there
was
no
need
for
this
extraordinary
relief.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
regarding
the
question
of
the
amount
of
time
these
proceedings
might
take,
i
think
there's
one
further
observation
i
might
make.
i've
already
suggested
that
this
is
always
under
judicial
control.
i
would
also
suggest
as
i
believe
we
have
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief
that
it
is
indistinguishable
from
the
question
how
long
shall
a
criminal
prosecution
take.
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
once
and
indictment
is
brought
in
an
obscenity
case,
that
case
must
be
listed
--
lifted
on
the
calendar
over
cases
involving
prosecutions
for
murder
or
interstate
bank
theft,
of
the
like.
similarly
here,
simply
because
an
administrative
complaint
may
have
been
filed,
that
fact
alone
doesn't
introduce
any
particular
compulsions
of
time,
although
the
existence
of
a
section
4007
order
might.
finally,
i
should
just
like
to
remind
the
court
of
footnote
22
in
the
interstate
circuit
opinion
again,
in
which
the
court
did
indicate
i
think
clearly
that
the
simple
burden
of
an
administrative
act
to
avoid
default
was
not
the
kind
of
burden
which
was
involved
in
the
freedman
holding.
on
these
grounds,
we
suggest
that
the
decisions
in
both
of
these
cases
must
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
central
district
of
california
has
held
section
4006
of
the
postal
code
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
in
the
book
bin
case
which
immediately
follows,
another
such
court
sitting
in
the
northern
district
to
georgia
also
held
section
4006
unconstitutional
on
its
face
together
with
section
4007
of
the
code.
and
because
of
the
similarity
of
the
issues,
the
government
filed
a
single
jurisdictional
statement,
brief
and
appendix
and
i
believe
that
will
be
helpful
now
to
make
a
statement
in
sufficient
detailed
to
illuminate
the
issue
in
both
cases.
and
i
say
parenthetically
that
while
i
will
continue
to
refer
to
the
statute
of
sections
4005
and
4006
under
the
postal
reform
act
passed
in
the
middle
of
the
summer,
they
are
now
actually
section
or
they
will
shortly
be
sections
3005
and
3006,
but
they
are
otherwise
unchanged.
the
decisions
in
both
courts
were
limited
to
procedural
questions
arising
under
the
statute.
while
the
papers
for
appellees
contended
that
the
publications
in
question
are
not
obscene,
my
understanding
is
that
the
proceedings
never
reached
that
point
and
that
in
fact
neither
of
the
three-judge
courts
which
decided
these
cases
ever
had
the
magazines
in
issue
before
them.
the
decisions
assumed
that
the
traffic
in
obscenity
could
be
barred
from
the
mails
and
considered
only
whether
these
two
sections
were
constitutionally
appropriate
procedures
for
accomplishing
that
purpose.
section
4006
provides
that
when
the
postmaster
general
finds
the
person
as
using
the
mails
to
sell
or
advertise
obscene
matter,
he
may
issue
an
administrative
order
intercepting
mail
addressed
to
that
person
and
directing
that
it
be
returned
to
the
sender
marked
as
unlawful.
the
section
and
its
remedy
are
almost
precisely
the
same
as
that
provided
in
section
4005
of
the
code.
again,
now
we
numbered
section
3005,
dealing
with
the
use
of
the
mails
to
promote
fraudulent
enterprises,
a
section
which
this
court
has
twice
sustained
most
recently
an
opinion
my
mr.
justice
black
in
donaldson
versus
read
magazine,
333
u.s.
178.
administrative
proceedings
under
section
4006
again
are
governed
by
the
same
regulations
as
are
used
in
broad
proceedings
under
section
4005.
section
4007
governs
preliminary
juridical
relief
for
both
section
4005
and
section
4006.
the
regulations
concerned
that
to
govern
the
administrative
proceedings
are
set
out
and
extend
so
and
in
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement.
under
these
regulations,
the
statute
has
much
narrower
scope
than
might
at
first
appeared
from
its
language.
proceedings
start
when
the
postmaster
general
discovers
that
possibly
obscene
matter
is
being
sold
or
advertised
through
the
mail.
there
is,
that
is
no
obligation
to
submit
any
material
to
him
for
clearance
of
any
kind
or
for
any
other
purpose.
after
complaint
and
notice
a
trial
type
administrative
hearing,
fully
complying
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
held.
in
that
hearing,
the
government
not
only
has
the
burden
of
initiating
it
by
complaint,
but
also
of
establishing
the
obscenity
of
the
materials
or
the
fraudulent
nature
of
the
materials
challenged.
during
the
period
in
which
the
hearings
are
taking
twice,
unless
there
has
been
judicial
relief
under
section
4007,
the
mailer
continuous
to
receive
his
mail
completely
unimpeded.
the
hearing
officer
is
a
regular
departmental
examiner
whose
time
typically
is
principally
devoted
to
contractual
issues
and
other
departmental
matters.
he
is
required
to
write
as
full
an
opinion
on
as
carefully
preserved
a
record
as
any
federal
district
judge
would
be.
the
regulations
urge
speed
in
conducting
the
hearings
and
disposing
of
the
complaint,
but
again
it
is
only
when
a
final
administrative
determination
has
been
made
that
the
item
sold
or
advertised
are
indeed
obscene
that
any
step
can
be
taken
by
the
post
office
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
proceedings
to
interdict
the
defendant’s
mail.
like
these
procedures,
the
order
entered
by
the
postmaster
in
a
section
4006
case
is
identical
in
form
and
in
execution
to
that
which
is
entered
in
fraud
cases
under
section
4005.
it
directs
the
postmaster
to
remove
from
the
mail
and
return
to
the
sender
appropriately
stamped,
all
mail
connected
with
the
items
which
have
been
found
obscene
or
fraudulent
as
the
case
maybe.
it
also
directs
the
postmaster
to
refuse
to
honor
postal
money
orders
drawn
in
payment
for
these
items
or
in
response
to
the
fraudulent
enterprise.
it
maybe
clear
from
the
form
of
address
used
or
from
information
on
the
envelope
that
some
mail
is
unconnected
with
the
adjudicated
items.
that
mail
is
immediately
delivered.
the
rest
generally
speaking,
the
postmaster
cannot
inspect
on
its
own
but
since
the
constitution
and
statutes
protect
first
class
mail
from
such
inspection.
it
is
therefore
held
that
the
post
office
for
inspection
by
the
addressee
and
anything
not
concerned
with
the
adjudicated
items
will
be
delivered
to
him
when
he
inspects
it.
only
mail
which
is
connected
with
the
adjudicated
items
or
which
is
not
inspected
within
a
reasonable
time,
they
are
stamped
and
returned
to
the
sender
marked
as
the
statute
directs.
once
the
section
4006
order
has
become
final
in
administrative
proceedings,
the
order
goes
into
effect
automatically
without
any
need
for
judicial
enforcement.
review
maybe
sought
however
in
district
court.
and
in
order
to
describe
the
effect
that
we
believe
that
review
has
on
the
administrative
order,
it
will
be
helpful
to
turn
now
to
section
4007
which
is
principally
at
issue
here
in
the
second
of
these
two
cases,
the
book
bin
case.
section
4007
provides
for
preliminary
judicial
relief
during
the
pendency
of
administrative
proceedings
under
both
the
fraud
and
the
obscenity
provisions.
it
has
been
prominently
used
in
fraud
cases
and
it
might
be
instructive
to
give
an
example
of
that.
an
advertisement
was
recently
paste
--
placed
in
a
california
newspaper
offering
a
very
low
cost
to
hawaii
vacation
if
the
person
responding
would
only
send
a
$25.00
registration
fee.
the
post
office,
suspecting
fraud
and
able
to
convince
district
judge
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
advertisement
was
fraudulent,
obtained
a
section
4007
order
and
under
that
order
was
able
to
intercept
$250,000.00
in
remittances
that
had
been
sent
to
the
advertiser
who
indeed
did
prove
as
i
understand
to
be
conducting
a
fraudulent
campaign.
similarly
in
a
section
4006
case,
that
is
in
an
obscenity
case
use
of
a
section
4007
order
might
be
proper
or
helpful
in
preventing
widespread
dissemination
of
the
materials
concerned
before
administrative
proceedings
could
be
complete.
procedures
under
section
4007
are
those
which
govern
interim
injunctive
relief
generally
in
federal
courts
and
in
particular
those
specified
by
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
correct
and
of
course
the
same
situation
here.
the
mailer
may
continue
to,
when
i
speak
of
the
mailer,
the
person
against
whom
the
order
is
directed,
may
continue
to
advertise,
and
may
continue
solicit
remittances
and
if
he
ultimately
prevails
well
he
will
receive
all
those
orders
and
remittances.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
any
letter
to
him
would
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
way
as
under
the
statute
except
that
it
wouldn’t
be
returned.
that
is
mail
which
clearly
was
not
connected
with
the
enterprise
would
be
delivered.
a
mail
which
might
be
would
be
held
for
inspection
and
could
be
removed
if
it
was
found
not
to
be
connected.
the
relationship
of
the
statute
to
rule
65,
i
think
is
significant
because
of
that
section's
limitations
on
the
possibility
of
ex
parte
relief.
if
the
government
knows
the
mailer's
address
for
the
purpose
of
getting
relief
under
section
4007,
that
obviously
also
knows
his
address
for
the
purpose
serving
notice
of
those
proceedings.
and
for
these
reasons,
such
proceedings
can
never
be
ex
parte.
in
order
to
justify
interim
relief,
the
government
must
produce
the
material
thought
to
obscene
and
must
satisfy
the
judge
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
is
obscene.
the
interim
relief
granted
as
i
just
explained
is
the
impounding
of
the
incoming
mail
with
delivery
of
mail
which
seems
not
to
be
concerned
with
the
enterprise
in
question
and
possible
delivery
of
other
mail
with
an
inspection
it
is
found
not
to
have
to
do
with
it.
in
addition,
as
in
the
case
of
all
interim
relief
in
this
nature,
there
is
always
available
through
judicial
processes,
the
possibility
of
modification
of
the
order
when
either
delay
or
other
circumstances
would
tend
to
warrant
that
relief.
because
section
4007,
if
i
may
return
now
to
section
4006,
because
section
4007
provides
only
for
impounding
the
mail
during
review
of
an
administrative
order
and
section
4007
specifically
states
that
it
is
preliminary
relief
both
during
the
administrative
proceedings
and
during
any
appeal
there
from.
because
section
4007
provides
only
for
impounding
of
the
mail
during
review
of
the
order,
we
have
interpreted
section
4006
as
subject
to
the
same
limitation.
that
is
if
review
of
the
section
4006
order
is
sought,
the
post
office
can
only
impound
incoming
mail
until
its
order
has
been
judicially
approved.
the
statute
on
its
face
is
subject
to
the
contrary
interpretation
and
indeed
if
no
review
were
sought,
the
post
office
believes
that
the
section
4006
orders
immediately
effective.
but
we
think
the
necessary
consequence
of
section
4007
is
at
least
that
where
review
of
the
section
4006
order
is
sought.
that
has
the
effect
of
transmuting
the
relief
for
the
interim
to
simple
impoundment
only
when
judicial
approval
has
been
obtained
were
review
is
sought,
could
the
post
office
begin
to
return
mail
to
the
sender
stamped
as
the
statute
directs.
and
indeed
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
one
of
the
possibilities
open
in
this
case,
we
don’t
urge
it,
but
we
don’t
believe
it
would
wrench
the
statute
if
it
we’re
necessary,
would
be
to
give
an
even
more
restrictive
interpretation
to
section
4006
and
hold
that
where
review
is
sought
no
effect
could
be
given
to
section
4006
order
so
that
interim
relief
would
depend
entirely
on
the
availability
and
the
obtaining
of
judicial
relief
under
section
4007.
turning
very
briefly
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
appellee
publishes
advertises
and
sells
through
the
mails
a
variety
of
magazines
to
the
character
described
in
our
brief.
in
the
fall
of
1968,
the
postmaster
general
become
aware
of
seven
of
these
in
particular
and
directed
that
section
4006
proceedings
be
brought.
a
complaint
was
filed
and
an
administrative
hearing
set
for
december
3,
1968.
on
the
same
day
as
the
hearing
december
3,
the
post
office
secured
the
temporary
restraining
order
under
section
4007
specifically
limited
to
the
seven
magazines
charged
on
the
basis
of
the
finding
of
probable
cause
to
believe
them
obscene.
on
december
31,
the
judicial
officer
filed
the
length
of
the
opinion,
set
out
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
and
our
jurisdictional
statement
finding
that
each
of
the
magazines
was
obscene.
appellee
then
brought
this
injunctive
action
to
bar
enforcement
of
the
resulting
administrative
order.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
held
section
4006
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
sole
stated
ground
of
decision
was
that
the
statute
failed
to
meet
the
standard
set
by
this
court
in
freedman
versus
maryland
380
u.s.
51.
on
the
government’s
appeal,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
march
2,
of
this
year.
now
i
think
there
are
three
principle
points
to
which
i
have
to
address
myself.
one
of
them
not
decided
by
either
of
the
courts
below,
but
suggested
i
think
more
or
less
inevitably
by
intervening
decisions
which
as
this
court
knows
we
have
appealed
here.
and
that
is
the
question
extensively
settled
in
roth
versus
united
states
whether
indeed
the
congress
can
regulate
the
use
of
mails
for
the
sending
of
obscene
matter.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
particular
procedures,
administrative
procedures
in
this
case
as
i
mentioned
this
case,
the
mailbox
case
deals
only
with
section
4006
and
when
i
refer
to
section
4007
any
discussion
of
it,
i
think
it
would
appropriately
deferred
to
the
book
bin
case
whether
the
administrative
procedures
for
determining
obscenity
are
appropriate
under
this
court’s
decision
in
freedman
versus
maryland,
now
with
the
sole
grounded
decision
below.
the
third
point
which
was
a
grounded
decision
in
the
book
bin
case
is
the
issue
whether
the
orders
which
maybe
obtained
as
relief
are
a
proper
form
of
relief
in
light
of
this
court’s
decisions
and
in
particular
decision
lamont
versus
the
postmaster
general.
on
the
question
of
authority
to
close
the
mails
to
this
kind
of
matter,
the
general
authority
of
congress
over
the
mails
is
firmly
established
in
as
i
mentioned
before
precisely
similar
circumstances
except
that
it
--
the
occasion
was
fraud
rather
than
obscenity.
this
court
has
upheld
by
a
substantial
margin,
precisely
the
same
form
of
relief,
that
is
the
donaldson
case
which
we
discuss
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
but
it
might
be
helpful
i
think
to
simply
read
one
short
passage
from
the
opinion
appearing
at
page
190
of
the
report
which
it
seems
to
us
is
equally
applicable
here.
all
the
forgoing
statutes
and
others
which
need
not
be
referred
to
manifest
a
purpose
of
congress
to
utilize
its
powers
to
protect
people
against
fraud
in
that
case,
this
government
power
has
always
been
recognized
in
this
country
and
it’s
firmly
established.
the
particular
statutes
here
attacked
have
been
regularly
enforced
by
the
executive
officers
in
the
courts
for
more
than
half
a
century.
they
are
now
part
and
parcel
of
our
governmental
fabric.
the
same
maybe
said
with
equal
strength
i
think
of
the
obscenity
statutes
which
were
upheld
not
six
years
later,
not
this
particular
statute,
but
other
statutes
dealing
with
the
government’s
authority
over
the
mails
in
the
roth
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1950,
two
years
after
the
decision
in
donaldson
and
on
the
map,
excuse
me
on
the
model,
on
the
model
of
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
obviously
mr.
justice
blackmun
it
would
depend
somewhat
on
the
character
of
the
affirmance.
i
think
there
is
a
particular
risk
in
that
direction
under
section
4007
which
treats
both
statutes
and
the
objections
to
what
seems
to
me
to
run
equally
to
the
fraud
statute
as
to
here.
the
court
maybe
able
to
discern
some
differences
between
fraud
and
obscenity,
the
government
does
not.
other
than
that,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
certainly
yes.
the
interests
of
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
mails
have
sometimes
been
questioned.
i
realize
that
there
is
a
position
which
now
has
substantial
adherence
in
the
court
that
the
federal
government
has
somewhat
less
interest
in
regulation
of
these
matters
than
perhaps
the
states
have.
but
i
think
it’s
fair
to
observe
that
that
position
is
always
been
articulated
in
terms
of
a
level
of
obscenity
rather
than
the
question
whether
the
regulation
is
not
possible,
whether
the
materials
in
question
must
be
hardcore
or
not
which
might
be
insisted
upon
to
the
federal
government
and
not
for
the
states
and
not
whether
a
particular
form
of
regulation
would
or
would
not
be
possible.
and
i
think
it's
incumbent
on
me
to
point
out
that
the
consequences
for
the
government
and
for
the
government’s
posture
here
are
not
at
all
abstract
as
the
court
knows,
use
of
the
postal
services
which
is
a
government
enterprise
is
a
very
valuable
tool
for
distributors
through
the
mail
and
i
think
anytime
that
the
government
becomes
involved
in
this
enterprise
by
lending
this
aid,
there
must
be
some
appearance
to
the
people
of
the
country
that
this
legitimizes
in
some
sense,
the
enterprise
which
is
taking
place.
and
if
indeed
it
is
an
illegitimate
enterprise
one
which
the
government
has
a
right
to
interfere
with,
why
then
the
government
cannot
tolerate,
indeed
will
not
tolerate
that
situation.
it’s
not
irrelevant
in
these
circumstances
that
these
mailers
have
a
claim
not
simply
to
pay
their
own
way,
but
to
have
the
government
pay
part
of
the
way
for
them
through
use
of
second
or
fourth
class
mailing
privileges.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
believe
though
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
this
case
must
be
decided
on
the
proposition
that
any
material
could
be
sent.
if
i
may
turn
now
to
stanley
versus
georgia,
only
briefly
i
--
as
the
court
knows
expect
to
be
back
on
that
question
later
on,
but
the
suggestion
has
been
made
now.
well,
here
we
have
some
transactions
that
take
place
through
the
first
class
mails,
sealed
mails,
isn’t
this
a
special
situation
in
which
the
government
could
not
interfere.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
publications
that
might
be
so
sent.
the
remittances
to
--
this
particular
statute
interferes
that
with
the
remittances
which
are
received
by
the
publishers
and
those
would
generally
be
sent
by
this
first
class
mail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
the
first
class
mail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
in
referring
to
that
i
was
simply
trying
to
lay
some
groundwork
for
the
proposition
established
by
roth
but
that
to
be
called
into
question
by
stanley
that
indeed
there
is
some
interest
in
regulating
in
this
area
that
the
government
had
some
very
substantial
interest
in
dealing
with
this
field.m
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
also
true.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
any
--
i
think
any
sort
of
fraud
that’s
dealt
with
through
the
mail
there’s
also
a
section
which
was
initially
the
sections
sought
to
--
that
sought
to
deal
with
obscenity
simply
because
that
was
the
way
that
the
purveyors
of
this
stuff
originally
conducted
their
business
having
to
do
with
the
use
of
false
names
and
addresses.
i
might
point
out
again
and
it’s
the
special
character
of
the
mails
that
even
if
one
gave
stanley
its
broadest
reading,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
it
necessarily
foreclosed
the
type
of
relief
which
the
statute
embodies
in
that
one
cannot
know
as
one
can
where
material
is
sold
over
the
counter.
one
cannot
know
whether
the
sale
involved
is
indeed
to
an
adult
or
consensual
of
the
two
parameters
of
the
stanley
opinion
on
which
a
considerable
weight
has
been
placed.
but
going
beyond
that,
i
think
it’s
sufficient
to
observe
at
this
point
that
the
stanley
opinion
carefully
preserved
the
right
of
state
and
federal
government
to
proceed
against
commercial
enterprises
in
this
field
and
it
is
not
hard
to
discern
in
that
opinion
which
cites
the
first
amendment,
nonetheless
a
considerable
degree
of
emphasis
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
on
conceded
notions
of
privacy
which
are
especially
appropriate
there.
indeed
as
we
suggest,
it
seems
to
us
more
appropriate
to
deal
with
stanley
as
a
case
imposing
a
disability
on
the
government
because
of
the
particular
dangers
of
the
situation
with
which
the
georgia
statute
in
that
case
attempted
to
deal
than
a
case
which
recognizes
any
kind
of
right
to
receive
on
the
part
of
the
individual
involved
in
which
might
therefore
be
used
as
a
tool
as
indeed
the
purveyors
of
this
material
are
seeking
to
use
it
for
expanding
the
area
in
which
they
may
operate
free
of
government
interference
or
supervision.
turning
to
the
freedman
question,
it
seems
to
us
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief
that
this
case
is
entirely
different
in
the
situation
which
confronted
this
court
in
freedman
versus
maryland.
if
i
may
recount
that
briefly,
that
case
was
concerned
with
movies.
the
law
before
the
court
require
that
anyone
who
wish
to
show
a
movie
in
maryland
before
he
could
show
it,
he
must
submit
it
to
a
board
of
censors
and
that
board
would
then
decide
whether
or
not
he
would
be
permitted
to
show
it
in
the
state.
there
was
no
particular
certainty
about
how
long
that
would
take
about
that
process.
there
was
no
particular
certainty
about
how
long
it
might
take
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
it
reviewed.
here
entirely
in
contrast,
these
magazines
were
being
advertised
and
sent
through
the
mails
for
the
moment,
we
may
assume
at
the
moment
that
they
came
off
the
press.
there
was
no
governmental
interference,
no
governmental
clearance
of
any
kind.
similarly,
the
board
which
reviewed
the
movies
in
freedman,
was
a
board
which
did
nothing
else.
here,
the
matter
goes
to
a
federal
hearing
examiner
or
judicial
officer,
someone
within
the
administrative
process
to
be
sure
about
the
person
who
as
many
of
the
insulations
of
which
judges
enjoy,
who
sees
a
broad
range
of
problems
come
before
him.
one
of
whom
it
certainly
could
not
be
said
as
the
court
remarked
that
the
board
in
freedman
versus
maryland
that
his
business
is
to
censor.
there
is
a
necessity
here
that
the
government
go
forward
by
filing
a
complaint.
there
is
no
burden
of
going
forward
on
the
part
of
the
mailer.
there
is
a
necessity
here
that
the
government
prove
that
the
matter
is
obscene.
there
is
no
burden
to
be
carried
by
the
person
using
the
mails.
indeed,
the
only
point
at
which
the
appellee
is
here
have
been
able
to
rely
on
freedman
as
in
a
singular
question
of
appealing.
it
is
true
that
the
section
4006
order
goes
into
effect
automatically
and
if
they
don’t
appeal,
then
it
will
have
effect
on
them
and
to
that
extent
it
can
be
said
that
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
require
judicial
involvement.
but
that
we
submit
is
no
different
from
the
possibility
of
default
which
always
inheres
in
any
kind
of
process
because
every
incentive
under
the
statute
is
for
these
individuals
to
appeal
to
the
courts.
if
they
do
so,
at
the
least,
under
the
reading
of
section
4006,
which
we
consider
mandatory,
they
will
have
preserved
their
mail
for
the
possibility
that
on
judicial
review
it
will
be
found
to
have
been
not
obscene
and
during
that
period
of
course
they
are
free
to
go
forward
and
to
continue
to
solicit
remittances
for
these
magazines,
remittances
which
they
know
if
they
succeed
they
will
receive
and
if
they
don’t
succeed,
i
suppose
in
this
line
of
enterprise
that
that
might
even
be
some
kind
of
a
badge
on
the
sleeve
as
well.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
the
only
burden
is
the
burden
to
file
an
appeal.
there
are
possible
issues
of
timeliness,
but
as
i
shall
discuss
in
the
book
bin
case,
i
think
those
are
amply
dealt
with
by
court's
powers
to
modify
section
4007
relief.
certainly,
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
on
appeal,
will
the
sender
carry
some
kind
of
burden
of
showing
that
its
material
was
not
obscene,
that
the
post
office
decided
the
case
wrongly.
at
least
as
long
as
this
court’s
present
practice
continues,
i
think
it
must
be
clear
to
any
court
in
this
country
that
they
may
not
accept
the
judgment
which
someone
else
may
have
made
about
whether
material
is
obscene
or
not.
that
they
must
themselves
inspect
and
consider
the
material
in
light
of
the
record
which
has
been
made,
yes,
but
it’s
a
full
record
with
transcript
and
everything
else
which
could
be
hoped
for
and
must
themselves
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
constitution
protects
it
or
does
not
do
so.
and
as
long
as
that
line
of
cases
persists
certainly
then
the
answer
is
the
only
burden
on
the
appellees
in
a
case
like
this
is
the
burden
of
filing
an
appeal
and
indeed
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
footnote
22
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
that’s
true.
i
think
that
gets
to
the
other
third
aspect
of
the
case
what
i
might
call
the
lamont
issues
although
i
don’t
think
it’s
precisely
that
scope
of
relief
as
distinct
from
a
question
of
the
regularity
of
the
proceedings
and
i
have
been
dealing
with
freedman
as
directed
principally
at
questions
of
proceedings
in
whether
the
proceedings
are
themselves
adequate.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
just
--mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
obviously,
this
case
concerns
the
same
legal
questions
and
so
i
will
be
making
a
continuous
argument
in
that
sense,
but
if
i
may
just
a
moment,
correct
a
couple
that
i
think
a
factual
overstatement
regarding
the
case
just
concluded.
my
understanding
is
that
the
stays
which
are
in
effect
concerning
the
mail
received
by
the
mailbox
in
this
case
were
consented
to
or
at
least
not
opposed
by
mr.
fleishman
on
behalf
of
his
client
and
--
well,
he
may
have
given
a
contrary
impression.
the
original
orders
in
this
case
came
on
as
a
result
of
unsolicited
advertisement
which
the
post
inspectors
received
from
the
mailbox.
now
proceeding
to
the
book
bin
then
i
think
my
statement
may
be
brief.
appellee
advertises
and
sells
through
the
mail
and
like
the
mailbox,
a
substantial
number
of
publications
of
the
character
suggested
by
the
advertising
exhibit
reproduced
at
pages
58
and
59
of
the
record.
a
section
4006
proceeding
was
brought
against
the
book
bin
alleging
that
one
of
these
publications
entitled
novels
of
france
was
obscene
and
on
june
6,
1969,
the
government
sought
a
section
4007
protective
order
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
appellees
counterclaimed
for
an
injunction
forbidding
enforcement
of
sections
4006
and
4007.
a
three-judge
district
court
was
convened
and
granted
the
counterclaim.
the
court
found
that
the
procedures
for
examining
mail
possibly
connected
with
the
challenged
publication
were
overbroad
and
that
the
procedures
generally
failed
to
meet
the
standards
of
freedman
versus
maryland.
on
the
government's
appeal,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
march
2
of
this
year.
if
i
may
go
--
turn
first
and
i
realize
mr.
justice
harlan
that
your
question
regarding
the
scope
of
relief
in
this
case
remains
open
and
is
perhaps
the
most
serious
of
the
questions
in
this
case,
but
i
do
want
first
to
examine
briefly
the
other
procedures
of
section
4007,
the
operative
procedures
as
it
were.
the
procedures
that
put
in
an
operation
because
the
scope
of
relief
question
is
really
shared
with
section
4006.
section
4007
as
i
stated
at
the
beginning
of
the
prior
case
is
basically
a
reference
to
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
entitles
the
government
to
get
interim
relief
against
the
distribution
of
the
magazines
of
this
type
or
against
fraudulent
enterprises
and
circumstances
in
which
such
relief
could
be
obtained
under
rule
65.
that
means
among
other
things
that
the
proceedings
cannot
be
ex-parte
and
therefore,
the
consideration,
which
principally
i
think
animated
this
court's
decision
or
the
concern
i
suppose,
which
principally
animated
this
court's
decision
in
kingsley
books
and
subsequent
opinions
construing
that
case
as
absent.
in
addition,
there
is
the
necessity
of
showing
a
probable
cause
in
two
respects.
first
to
believe
that
the
magazines
are
obscene
and
that
would
be
a
judicial
finding
and
second
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
indeed,
the
government
will
be
irreparably
injured,
that
there
is
some
need
for
emergency
relief
and
kingsley
books
spoke
to
both
of
those
issues.
the
court
said
at
page
440
of
volume
354
of
the
report,
“authorization
of
an
injunction
pendente
lite
as
part
of
this
scheme
during
the
period
within
which
the
issue
of
obscenity
must
be
promptly
tried
and
adjudicated
in
an
adversary
proceeding
for
which
adequate
notice,
judicial
hearing
and
fair
determination
are
assured
is
a
safeguard
against
frustration
of
the
public
interest
in
effectuating
the
judicial
condemnation
of
obscene
matter.”
it
is
a
break
on
the
temptation
to
exploit
a
filthy
business
offered
by
the
limited
hazards
of
piecemeal
prosecutions
sale
by
sale
of
a
publication
already
condemned
as
obscene.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
concurrence
characterizing
it
accurately
in
his
dissent
rather
in
quantity
of
books,
stated
the
grounds
that
were
important
to
that
decision
and
into
the
distinction
of
that
decision
that
was
made
by
this
court
in
the
market
case
--
excuse
me,
on
the
marcus
case.
first,
that
the
court
could
exercise
an
independent
check
on
the
judgment
of
the
prosecuting
authority
at
the
point
before
any
restraint
took
place,
second
that
the
restraints
ran
only
against
the
named
publication,
third,
that
no
extensive
restraints
were
imposed
before
an
adversary
proceeding
and
fourth,
that
the
new
york
code
required
decision
within
two
days
of
the
trial
on
the
obscenity
question.
now,
the
only
issue
regarding
those
four
statements
in
this
case
i
believe
is
the
matter
of
time
and
it
is
the
government's
position
basically
that
that
question
is
adequately
controlled
by
the
power
which
a
court
of
equity
always
retains
to
modify
its
judgment
when
subsequent
events
show
that
indeed,
the
person
against
whom
a
temporary
restraint
runs
is
being
improperly
or
unfairly
injured
by
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings
by
the
continuation
of
the
relief
during
a
period
of
undue
delay.
in
that
respect,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
some
confusion
which
i
think
may
exist
regarding
the
relationship
that
we
see
between
section
4007
and
4006.
4006
in
no
event
takes
effect
before
a
final
administrative
decision
has
been
reached.
once
a
final
administrative
decision
has
been
reached,
it
does
take
effect
of
its
own
force
and
without
need
for
enforcement.
the
person
against
whom
the
order
is
entered
may
then
seek
review
as
was
done
in
these
cases
essentially
and
the
issue
then
is
what
is
the
affect
of
that
petition
for
review.
the
government's
position,
principle
position
is
that
that
petition
for
review
operates
to
convert
the
section
4006
order
into
what
is
in
effect
a
section
4007
order,
an
order
impounding
the
mail
for
the
duration
of
the
proceedings
to
challenge
the
administrative
decision.
so
that
there
would
be
no
return
of
the
mail
once
an
appeal
had
been
filed.
now,
there
might
be
in
the
intervening
period
some
slight
length
of
time
during
which
mail
would
be
returned
or
would
in
that
sense
and
some
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
during
that
brief
period,
the
length
of
that
period
is
in
counsel's
control
and
i
am
sure
that
if
representations
were
made
that
an
appeal
would
be
taken
that
an
appropriate
stay
would
be
issued.
it
takes
time
to
transmit
these
orders
after
all
from
washington
where
they
are
entered
to
the
postmasters
out
in
the
field
and
if
such
a
stay
wouldn't
be
entered,
i'm
sure
this
court
and
other
courts
would
be
quick
to
grant
one.
so
that
that
is
the
necessary
affect
of
an
appeal.
and
now,
we
say
in
addition
although
we
don't
urge
it
but
if
the
court
feels
that
incumbent
upon
it,
it
would
not
disturb
the
statutory
scheme
in
view
of
the
history
of
section
4007
to
say
that
the
appeal
has
a
more
radical
effect,
that
is
that
it
suspends
any
impact
whatever
of
the
administrative
order
and
leaves
the
government
completely
dependent
on
it's
ability
to
get
a
judicial
order
under
section
4007.
so
that
under
that
second
reading,
i
think
you
were
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
in
your
question
that
there
would
be
no
burden
so
far
as
section
4006
is
concerned
on
the
person
subject
to
the
order
other
than
the
burden
of
filing
his
appeal
and
seeing
to
it
that
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
now,
i'm
talking
about
section
4007
and
which
need
not
--
the
government
i
think
need
not
wait.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
the
government
cannot
invoke
section
4007
before
there
has
been
an
administrative
decision.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
keep
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
and
therefore,
i
think
it's
certainly
appropriate
for
the
government
to
seek
such
an
order
as
it
did
in
the
mailbox
case
when
the
hearing
begins.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
of
course
will
be
before
the
decision
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
in
the
particular
case.
it
was
a
month
before
the
decision.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
so
that
there
will
be
possibly
a
period
of
time
during
which
there
is
not
yet
any
administrative
decision.
there
could
not
yet
be
any
administrative
restraint,
but
there
maybe
a
judicial
order
outstanding
which
does
impose
a
restraint
of
impounding
the
mail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
course
that's
appealable
and
maybe
stayed.
it
requires
as
i
have
said
before
that
the
judge
have
the
specific
material
before
him
and
that
he
inspect
them
and
determine
that
there
is
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
are
obscene.
and
indeed,
that
was
precisely
the
procedure.
if
the
court
will
see
we
have
reproduced
it
at
the
rear
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
preliminary
injunction
which
were
in
fact
entered
in
the
mailbox
case
and
the
court
will
see
that
they
refer
specifically
to
the
seven
magazines
which
were
at
issue
here.
and
i
may
say
too,
kingsley
itself
is
probably
sufficient
authority
or
a
sufficient
demonstration
of
the
need
for
this
sort
of
pendente
lite
relief,
if
it
were
necessary
to
give
anymore,
the
question
arose
with
regard
to
the
specific
provision
of
section
4006.
before
passage
of
section
4007,
the
postmaster
general
attempted
to
forge
his
own
impoundment
authority.
he
was
ultimately
unsuccessful
in
the
court
of
appeal,
but
in
the
interim
a
motion
for
stay
came
before
mr.
justice
douglas.
he
wrote
a
lengthy
opinion
which
is
reported
and
commented
on
by
the
appellees
here.
what's
notable
about
that
action
i
think
is
that
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
impoundment
that
he
acknowledged
that
there
are
many
situations.
one
of
the
burdens
of
litigation
may
be
putting
things
aside
for
the
time
in
order
to
preserve
the
status
quo
and
that
was
standard
versus
olsen
which
is
reported
in
the
supreme
court
report
volume
74,
at
page
768.
so
as
i
say,
the
principal
things
to
be
said
here
are
that
there
is
this
need
to
--
that
the
government
must
show
probable
cause.
it
must
show
a
need
for
emergency
relief.
there
is
complete
judicial
control
over
the
period
of
time
during
which
the
order
remains
in
effect.
it
is
at
once
appealable
on
the
issues
of
probable
cause
and
need
for
emergency
relief.
there
is
the
constant
possibility
of
modification
and
we
submit
that
all
of
this
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
the
correctness
of
the
procedure
even
if
what
were
involved
was
some
form
of
censorship,
but
of
course
that's
not
the
case.
it's
a
simple
postponement.
the
mailbox
man
for
all
we
know,
or
the
book
bin
may
and
for
all
we
know
has
continued
to
solicit
orders
and
those
orders
come
in
and
are
kept
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
period
of
time,
they
may
indeed
be
received.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
mailbox
or
the
book
bin
from
re-circulating
their
lists
with
a
letter
saying
“perhaps
you
didn't
receive
some
orders
that
you
sent
to
list.
we
want
you
to
know
we
are
in
this
trouble.”
while
in
many
industries,
advertisement
of
troubles
like
that
might
not
be
to
commercial
advantage,
it
seems
to
me
at
least
conceivable
that
in
this
industry,
it
would
be.
there
is
a
further
point
that
mr.
justice
harlan
has
averted
to
in
some
of
his
decisions
and
that
is
that
there
is
involved
in
these
materials
here
unlike
movies
that
communicate
ideas
or
political
speeches
that
have
a
certain
timeliness
still
in
the
materials
of
the
sort
involved
in
this
case
really
carry
no
urgency
of
that
sort.
whatever,
they
are
essentially
timeless
as
the
court
knows
from
the
descriptions
of
the
materials.
there
is
against
that
balance
to
the
need
of
the
government
for
relief
if
the
scheme
of
the
statute
is
to
be
upheld.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
what
i've
called
the
lamont
issues
which
i
think
i
would
agree
were
--
are
the
more
troublesome
in
the
case.
still
it
does
seem
to
me
that
they
were
principally
settled
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
donaldson
because
as
to
this
question,
the
way
in
which
an
order
interferes
or
may
interfere
with
a
person's
incoming
mail,
it
seems
to
me
the
effect
of
this
order
is
indistinguishable
from
the
orders
which
were
--
from
the
mail
which
was
involved
in
the
donaldson
case.
as
the
court
may
recall
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
target
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
only
mail
that
this
order
operates
on
is
incoming
mail
are
the
target
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
then
i
should
say
directly
operates
upon.
it
doesn't
prevent
them
from
getting
it
from
some
other
source
or
at
their
neighborhood
bookstore.
of
course
it
doesn't
in
that
sense
suppress
or
remove
the
materials
from
the
market.
it
does
remove
them
from
this
one
particular
market.
in
this
respect,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
order
is
essentially
of
the
same
impact
and
it's
essentially
indistinguishable
from
the
situation
in
donaldson.
i
might
remind
the
court
and
that
while
it
maybe
unusual,
nonetheless
in
donaldson
the
court
was
dealing
indeed
with
a
magazine.
fax
magazine,
reed
magazine
and
these
are
magazines
with
subscription
lists.
these
were
magazines
which
undoubtedly
had
persons
writing
to
them
for
proper
purposes.
as
the
case
started
out,
the
order
entered
against
the
magazines
in
question
was
quite
broad.
the
court
was
evidently,
properly
i
would
say
alarmed
at
the
breath
of
that
order.
it
heard
argument
once
and
then
set
the
case
for
re-argument
specifically
on
the
question
of
the
breath
of
order.
in
the
interim,
the
order
was
modified
and
the
court
then
concluded
that
with
that
modification,
a
modification
which
essentially
narrowed
the
orders
so
that
its
predictable
impact
was
principally
on
the
transactions
in
question
that
the
order
was
not
overbroad
and
indeed
was
proper.
the
problems
here
stem
from
the
necessity
of
honoring
the
privacy
of
the
mail
in
the
sense
that
the
government
may
not
open
a
person's
domestic
first
class
mail
out
of
his
presence
and
that
means
that
if
the
statutory
remedy
is
to
be
applied,
it
must
either
be
applied
against
all
mail
incoming
to
the
person
which
we
don't
assert
would
be
proper
and
do
not
attempt
or
there
must
be
some
provision
made
for
an
inspection
procedure
and
the
provision
for
an
inspection
procedure
is
what
at
issue
here.
i
don't
think
it
is
irrelevant
to
point
out
that
here
as
distinct
from
a
case
like
lamont,
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
innocent
party
whom
the
government
presumes
to
protect.
but
we
are
dealing
with
an
individual
who
has
either
been
adjudicated
or
whom
it
has
been
adjudicated
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
using
the
mails
for
an
illegal
improper
purpose
and
it
is
upon
the
basis
of
that
adjudication,
a
specific
adjudication
directed
to
him,
directed
after
adversary
proceedings
fully
consonant
with
due
process
that
this
remedy
is
applied.
now,
the
order
of
course
is
a
restraint
in
some
respects
but
that
is
a
restraint
which
can
readily
be
reduced
in
its
impact.
commercial
publishing
houses,
commercial
mailers
regularly
use
special
forms
of
address
in
connection
with
their
order
blanks.
where
that
is
done
only
envelopes
addressed
to
that
special
form
of
address
are
intercepted
and
detained
or
returned
as
the
case
maybe
and
again,
that
was
the
situation
in
donaldson.
as
a
practical
reality,
there
are
not
terribly
many
situations
where
an
individual
would
receive
private
mail
or
anything
of
that
sort
at
a
commercial
address
which
would
be
used
in
this
kind
of
situation.
there
are
for
the
specific
provisions
made
for
“for
waiting”
mail
without
interference
which
appears
from
its
cover
not
to
be
related
to
the
specific
publications
which
have
been
adjudicated.
and
in
sum
as
i
think
is
demonstrated
by
the
donaldson
opinion,
there
maybe
a
problem
in
particular
cases
about
an
order
being
overbroad.
i
think
there
is
not
a
problem
about
the
statute
necessarily
being
so.
even
the
inspection
itself
when
it
occurs
i
might
point
out,
it
need
not
and
in
fact
probably
is
not
in
the
realities
of
this
situation
to
be
a
reading
of
the
person's
mail
as
such.
we
know
that
the
way
these
publishing
houses
operate
is
on
a
cash
basis.
they
do
not
accept
orders
cod.
consequently,
any
letter
which
when
opening
was
found
to
include
no
check
would
immediately
be
a
candidate
for
passage
on.
there's
no
necessity
to
see
whether
it's
an
order
or
not
what
knows
it
on
the
basis
of
this
type
of
commercial
reality
or
usually,
there
will
be
order
blanks
or
something
else
of
the
sort
which
would
also
serve
in
identifying
function.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
are
some
issues
of
fact
that
might
be
explored.
there
maybe
some
questions
of
social
utility,
maybe
special
evidence
that
could
be
introduced
at
one
way
or
another
on
various,
the
elements
to
the
court's
obscenity
standards
as
they
have
evolved.
but
i
must
say
that
certainly
in
this
court's
practice,
it
does
seem
to
come
principally
down
to
a
matter
of
inspecting
the
materials
themselves
and
to
the
extent
that
that
is
the
test,
of
course,
there
s
no
difference.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
and
i
think
any
conscientious
judge
in
that
situation
would
take
more
time
rather
than
issue
the
order.
i
might
say
that
again,
that
there
are
substantial
interests
on
the
government's
side
warranting
this
procedure.
whatever
certificates
of
age
there
maybe
in
the
mail,
it
is
nonetheless
impossible
to
know
whether
in
fact
the
person
is
saying
that
he
is
21,
is
21.
if
you
sell
this
material
over
the
counter,
you
can
at
least
make
some
obvious
sorts
of
differentiations
along
that
score.
there
is
the
need
i
think
recognized
by
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
memoirs
for
cooperating
in
the
sense,
in
a
sense
with
the
states
who
are
inhibiting
the
spread
of
this
material
which
all
states
of
the
union
find
obnoxious
and
within
constitutional
bounds
properly
so.
and
as
kingsley
itself
recognized,
that
cannot
effectively
be
done
without
some
form
of
restraint.
there
is
the
matter
of
post
office
involvement
indeed
with
what
is
in
offense
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
time
for
the
prosecution
of
a
criminal
case
again,
there's
a
time
during
which
the
material
may
continue
to
be
sent.
in
sum,
i
believe
this
is
a
remedy
which
is
as
narrow
as
possible
under
the
exigent
circumstances
of
the
act,
something
which
this
court
indicated
in
the
burrstone
case,
it
would
consider
as
a
proper
consideration
in
passing
unconstitutionality
of
regulation
in
this
field.
a
few
concluding
observations
that
i'd
like
to
make
regarding
this
court's
decision
in
stanley
and
the
meaning
that
ought
to
be
given
to
it.
i
think
the
government's
approach
or
understanding
of
that
opinion
maybe
reflected
not
only
in
griswold
versus
connecticut
but
perhaps
better
than
elsewhere
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
poe
versus
ullman.
we
are
not
presented
simply
with
the
moral
judgment
to
be
passed
on
as
an
abstract
proposition.
a
secular
state
is
not
an
examiner
of
consciences
and
must
operate
in
the
realm
of
behavior
of
overt
actions
and
where
it
does
so
operate,
not
only
the
underlying
moral
purpose
of
it's
operations
but
also
the
choice
of
means
becomes
relevant
to
any
constitutional
judgment
on
what
is
done.
i
believe
that
stanley
was
a
decision
about
the
choice
of
means
for
regulating
obscenity
and
as
such,
the
government
has
no
qualms
with
it.
i
do
not
believe
as
the
court
said.
it
was
not
that
the
opinion
was
amended
in
any
way
to
interfere
with
general
government
regulation
in
this
particular
area,
but
someone
suggested
that
the
roth
opinion
has
proved
the
debacle.
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
remembering
back
to
what
was
available
on
the
news
stands
and
through
the
mails
in
1957
in
considering
what
is
there
now
that
is
was
a
debacle
at
least
for
anyone
on
the
side
of
the
fence
represented
by
the
person
who
made
the
observation
nor
do
i
think
that
the
issue
with
social
value
can
be
equated
with
monetary
value.
no
one
suggested
and
surely
the
authors
of
the
roth
opinion
understood
that
obscenity
was
handed
out
for
no
compensation
because
people
wouldn't
pay
for
it.
obviously
it
has
some
social
value
in
that
sense,
but
i
do
not
think
any
value
which
has
been
suggested
for
it
amounts
to
the
type
of
value
which
the
court
was
discussing
in
roth,
a
value
connected
with
ideas.
counsel
has
made
a
great
deal
of
our
brief
in
rowan.
those
quotes
were
taken
widely
out
of
context.
they
were
principally
quotations
which
the
government
itself
had
made
in
its
brief.
one
for
example
was
from
our
statement
of
facts
at
page
six
where
we
quoted
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
who
was
explaining
his
bill
and
other
was
from
the
harvard
law
review
and
so
forth.
the
principle
thing
to
be
noted
about
the
government's
position
in
that
case
is
that
that
deals
with
the
statute
which
has
much
wider
impact
than
on
materials
which
this
court
has
held
may
constitutionally
be
designated
obscene.
and
in
that
wider
area
where
the
individual
may
very
well
believe
and
many
individuals
do
believe
that
materials
this
court
has
held
are
not
obscene
and
nonetheless
objectionable.
the
mail
holder
is
given
a
quite
proper
control
over
what
comes
into
his
home.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
judicial
officer
is
the
judicial
officer
of
the
post
office.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
a
position
very
much
like
similar
positions
in
the
department
of
the
agriculture
and
other
places.
it's
defined
by
the
postal
laws
section
308
of
title
39
shall
perform
such
quasi
judicial
duties
that
the
postmaster
general
may
designate
and
he
is
the
agency
for
the
purposes
of
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
passes
on.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
more
than
a
trial
examiner
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
serve
the
same.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
a
censor
deals
strictly
with
these
materials.
80%
of
the
judicial
officer's
time
is
spent
passing
on
contractual
disputes
involving
the
building
of
post
officers.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
that's
a
lot
of
what
he
does,
yes.
he
passes
on
issues
of
second
class
mail
ability,
any
administrative
dispute
that
may
come
up
within
the
department
and
have
to
be
settled.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
precisely.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
precisely.
finally,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
say
that
the
government
does
indeed
assert
that
it
has
the
right
not
to
have
to
deliver
through
its
mails
some
of
the
materials
that
people
assert
the
right
to
send
through
it.
that
may
ultimately
be
what's
at
issue
on
this
case,
although
i
thought
it
had
been
settled
by
roth,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
overriding
interest
here
because
carriage
through
the
mails
is
not
simply
a
neutral
act.
it
involves
the
government
in
this
business
and
in
some
sense
puts
a
stamp
of
government
approval
if
not
government
subsidy
on
it.
that
is
why
i'm
quoting
from
an
editorial
in
the
london
times
which
was
written
on
a
somewhat
different
issue,
but
i
think
it's
perfectly
apt.
“that
is
why
those
who
were
of
the
opinion
that
material
passes
the
balance
of
decency
are
justified
in
denouncing
it
in
circumstances
like
these,
it
is
not
because
they
personally
are
affronted,
they
need
not
be
so
but
because
it
shifts
the
limits
of
the
publicly
permissible
sexual
display
and
shifts
them
in
a
direction
that
they
have
reason
to
believe
it
is
hurtful
to
the
values
they
uphold
and
to
the
well
being
of
their
society.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
have
only
three
very
short
points
to
make.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
first
is
this
was
as
i
think
counsel
just
stated,
a
test
case
and
as
test
cases
sometimes
do
it
had
many
flaws.
it
was
brought
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
kind
of
conflict
with
the
proceedings
on
the
west
coast,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
evaluated
as
an
ordinary
case
of
how
the
department
would
proceed
under
the
statute.
the
second
point
i
should
make
in
connection
with
this
issue
of
time
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
question
whether
that
was
a
case
in
which
had
it
come
to
an
issue,
the
government
could
have
demonstrated
that
it
was
entitled
to
the
extraordinary
relief
of
section
4007
is
not
an
issue
which
was
decided,
and
should
not
i
think
be
assumed
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
the
nature
of
the
magazine
and
the
nature
of
the
prosecution,
i
suppose
that
a
showing
that
four
months
had
elapsed
and
the
government
hadn't
shown
that
there
was
any
emergency
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
would
tend
to
persuade
you
that
there
was
no
need
for
this
extraordinary
relief.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
regarding
the
question
of
the
amount
of
time
these
proceedings
might
take,
i
think
there's
one
further
observation
i
might
make.
i've
already
suggested
that
this
is
always
under
judicial
control.
i
would
also
suggest
as
i
believe
we
have
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief
that
it
is
indistinguishable
from
the
question
how
long
shall
a
criminal
prosecution
take.
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
once
and
indictment
is
brought
in
an
obscenity
case,
that
case
must
be
listed
--
lifted
on
the
calendar
over
cases
involving
prosecutions
for
murder
or
interstate
bank
theft,
of
the
like.
similarly
here,
simply
because
an
administrative
complaint
may
have
been
filed,
that
fact
alone
doesn't
introduce
any
particular
compulsions
of
time,
although
the
existence
of
a
section
4007
order
might.
finally,
i
should
just
like
to
remind
the
court
of
footnote
22
in
the
interstate
circuit
opinion
again,
in
which
the
court
did
indicate
i
think
clearly
that
the
simple
burden
of
an
administrative
act
to
avoid
default
was
not
the
kind
of
burden
which
was
involved
in
the
freedman
holding.
on
these
grounds,
we
suggest
that
the
decisions
in
both
of
these
cases
must
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
