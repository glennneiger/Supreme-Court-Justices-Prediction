justice

stewart
the
statute
certainly
does
not
mention
misdemeanors,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
constitutional
right
to
a
change
of
venue
in
any
kind
of
a
case,
wholly
apart
from
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
sufficient
showing
it
was
community
prejudice
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
you
can
sense
mind
struggling
with
the
question
why
the
wisconsin
court
interpreted
its
statute
in
the
way
it
did
when
it
didn't
refer,
make
any
mention
to
misdemeanor
cases
whatsoever.
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
dubois,
does
the
record
show,
i
wish
to
be
sure
as
to
this
whether
there
was
any
offer
or
proof
of
community
prejudice?
justice
potter
stewart
with
an
affidavit?
it's
on
page
23-a
of
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
you
say
that
it
wasn't
clear
until
this
case
that
a
change
of
venue
on
a
misdemeanor
case
in
the
state
was
absolutely
impermissible.
that
was
only
in
this
case
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
and
then
the
subsequent
affirmance
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
that
it
became
clear
that
the
language
of
the
rather
ambiguous
language
of
the
state
statute
meant
that
only
felony
and
only
felony
cases
could
you
get
that
change
of
venue
and
that
they
were
absolutely
forbidden
in
misdemeanor
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
--
it
may
have
implication
i
suppose
but
i
thought
you
agreed
earlier
with
justice
blackmun
when
he
said
the
statutory
language
wasn't
all
that
clear.
and
now
in
your
responses
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
say
that
the
reason
that
our
case,
a
better
factual
case
wasn't
put
in
for
a
change
of
venue
was
that
counsel
for
the
defendant
merely
at
a
hopeless
case
anyway
because
clearly
they
would
--
couldn't
be
a
change
of
venue.
that's
in
--
for
me
a
little
inconsistent,
i
wondered,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
the
appellant's
theory
to
be
that
since
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
not
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
showing
of
--
no
sufficient
showing
of
community
prejudice
but
rather
on
the
ground
that
no
matter
how
much
community
prejudice,
you
may
show
i
cannot
and
will
not
listen
to
any
evidence
among
those
lines
because
the
statute
of
the
state
absolutely
forbids
me
to
grant
a
change
of
venue
so
any
hearing
on
that
community
prejudice
would
be
a
waste
of
time
for
both
of
us.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
that
we
must
assume
in
this
case
that
what
this
case
amounts
to
is
a
denial
of
a
hearing
on
community
prejudice
and
we
perhaps
may
assume
that
there
would
have
been,
could
have
been
an
extraordinary
showing
of
it,
right
along
the
lines
of
rideau
against
louisiana.
but
that
the
district
court
said
even
assuming
that
kind
of
a
case,
i
can't
hear
it,
won't
hear
it
because
i
can't
grant
a
change
of
venue
anyway.
it
makes
a
little
bit
like
that,
the
chicago
censorship
case
where
there
was
no
evidence
really
either
of
what
the
movie
was
but
assuming
the
very
most
defensive
imaginable
kind
of
a
movie,
the
question
was
that
was
there
any
power
to
have
a
prior
restraint
of
a
showing?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
last
question.
i
thought
the
state
had
taken
a
very
positive
position
as
to
the
availability
of
a
change
of
venue
in
a
misdemeanor
case
on
grounds
of
community
prejudice
and
if
this
is
so,
is
the
state
in
the
position
to
complain
about
the
deficiency
of
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
that
tileston
case
in
chicago?
justice
potter
stewart
it
required
different
area
of
the
law
but
i
think
in
this
respect,
there
is
an
analogy.
it
had
to
deal
with
the
right
to
sensor
a
movie,
any
movie
and
the
place
in
that
case
deliberately
kept
out
of
the
record
the
nature
of
the
movie.
and
therefore
ask
the
court
to
assume
that
it
was
the
worst
possible
kind
of
movie
and
said
even
on
that
assumption.
our
claim
is
there
can
be
no
censorship
of
it.
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
whatever
of
the
nature
of
the
movie
and
the
case
was
decided
and
the
constitutional
question
was
decided
as
i
remember
by
the
three-judge
district
court
and
i
know
by
this
court
that
kind
of
a
record
i.e.
no
record
at
all
to
speak
out.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
has
held
that
there
at
least
can
be
situations
where
in
order
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
of
law,
there
must
be
a
change
of
venue.
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
when
it
comes
to
rideau
case,
that's
one
that
comes
to
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
case
as
i
understand
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
said
even
in
a
rideau
case
there
cannot
be
a
change
of
venue
if
it's
a
misdemeanor.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
didn't
need
to
decide
that.
justice
potter
stewart
in
august
of
1968
and
page
205-a
of
the
record
indicates
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
was,
the
4th
day
of
february,
anno
domini
1969,
that's
within
a
year
so
as
of
the
time
of
the
opinion,
one
year
had
not
elapsed.
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
has
since.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
perhaps
the
answer
to
that
is
it
doesn't
say
one
year
after
final
judgment
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
one
year
after
trial.
