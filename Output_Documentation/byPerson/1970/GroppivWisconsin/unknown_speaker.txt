unknown
speaker
counsel,
at
this
point,
does
the
statute
in
so
many
terms
prohibit
the
change
of
venue
in
misdemeanor
cases?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
does
the
facts
that
the
jury
was
expeditiously
selected
way
against
that,
any
suggestion
of
community
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
counsel?
unknown
speaker
but
did
you
afterwards,
your
motion
for
new
trial
submit
any
evidence
with
respect
to
community
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
well
if
the
court,
i
take
it
the
wisconsin
court
said
that
that
they
were
certainly
weren't
holding
that
the
--
you
didn't
have
a
right
to
a
fair
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
as
there
had
been
community,
this
found
evidence,
community
prejudice,
you
could
have
concluded
that
--
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
constitutional
standard
is?
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
you
prevail,
do
you
think
that
by
the
graphic
that
a
–
you
bare
ground
now?
unknown
speaker
but
you
knew
the
statute
to
play
wouldn't
you.
i
suppose
the
new
statute
gives
you
the
projection?
unknown
speaker
now
there
is
the
position
that
justice
heffernan
took
on
the
dissent.
unknown
speaker
what
position
that
the
prosecution
take
below
on
this
question
of
publicity
and
burden
of
proof
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
well
is
it
possible
for
to
say
that
the
prosecution
prevented
the
presentation
of
such
facts?
unknown
speaker
or
forever
not
defending
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
was
there
ever
a
motion
based
on
--
for
a
continuance
based
on
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
did
the
counsel
say
that
such
a
motion
would
have
had
unfortunate
consequences
to
the
defense
in
the
sense
of
the
speedy
trial?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
a
motion
like
that
for
continuance?
you
waive
your
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
is
that
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
although
a
change
of
venue
would
involve
some
delay.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
your
argument
because
even
if
they
had
been
in
mass,
in
great
detail
they
would
not
be
admissible
by
your
own
interpretation
of
the
statute.
they
are
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
why
should
a
reviewing
court
act
like
a
trial
court?
i
have
looked
in
the
first
instance,
had
evidence
which
the
trial
court
had
said,
i
won't
look
at
all
and
the
trial
court
does
it
because
of
(inaudible)
law.
wouldn't
an
appellant
court
just
reversing
remand,
would
have
a
trial
judge
take
the
evidence
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
actually,
this
is
--
let's
say
this
had
been
a
felony
case
and
the
petitioner
wanted
to
a
change
of
venue
on
the
grounds
of
prejudice
and
the
trial
court
said,
awfully
sorry
that
we
don't
listen
to
evidence
like
that
in
this
court.
they
just
don't
listen
to
it,
at
least
as
for
my
confession
on
television.
sorry,
we
just
don't
listen
to
that
on
court
and
he
was
convicted
and
that
i
suppose
you
had
make
the
argument.
it
seems
to
me
like
you
would
that
unless
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record.
no
appellate
court
could
reverse
for
refusal
to
accept
evidence.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
unknown
speaker
so
it
acted
the
way
it
did.
unknown
speaker
at
that
very
place,
as
that
the
trial
ended
on
february
9,
1968
and
i
think
the
opinion
came
down
during
the
august
term
of
1968,
wasn't
that
supply
your
dates?
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
should
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
anyway
in
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
i
noticed
in
page
232-a
--
unknown
speaker
on
the
1st
day
of
april.
unknown
speaker
so
wasn't
until
after
the
year
it
expired
in
any
event
before
the
proceedings
and
the
supreme
court
were
precluded.
well,
if
the
statute
of
limitations
in
your
judgment
designed
to
run
from
the
date
of
judgment
as
final
or
from
the
date
of
the
trial.
here,
judgment
of
course
not
filed
until
our
--
we
(inaudible)
the
case.
unknown
speaker
would
not
be
what?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
if
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
from
the
date
of
final
judgment
of
one
year,
why
is
this
question
not
still
open
in
the
court
of
wisconsin
to
make
a
notion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
an
unfair
trial?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
you
take
it
here
and
after
appeal
and
get
decided
in
the
court
of
wisconsin,
do
you
think
that
you
have
been
barred?
unknown
speaker
well
it
might
be,
it
might
be
but
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
seemed
to
think
that
it
has
still
had
the
right
at
that
time.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
an
(inaudible)
from
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
which
is
final
after
appeal?
unknown
speaker
never
before
been
suggested
but
you
see
which
have
been
suggested
here
in
this
case,
in
this
opinion
of
the
supreme
court.
unknown
