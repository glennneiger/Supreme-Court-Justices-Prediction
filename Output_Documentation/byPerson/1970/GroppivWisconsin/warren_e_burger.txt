chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
26,
groppi
against
wisconsin.
mrs.
dubois
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible,
mrs.
dubois,
that
you
might
have
a
situation
that
the
jurisdiction,
the
original
jurisdiction
having
special
misdemeanor
court
conceivably
there
might
be
no
other
place
where
they
have
a
comparable
court
but
what
would
that
do
for
your
argument?
what
would
that
do
with
respect
to
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
be
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
might
be
no
misdemeanor
court
anywhere
else
in
the
state
and
some
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
what
impact
if
any
is
there
from
the
fact
that
wisconsin
legislature
has
now
extended
the
change
of
venue
provisions
to
cover
misdemeanor
cases
as
i
understand
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
--
going
back
to
the
point
raised
before
or
question
raised
before.
if
there
was
that
much
community
prejudice,
wouldn't
it
normally
be
a
matter
that
counsel
would
explore
very
extensively
in
examining
the
jurors
to
be
sure
that
he
had
eliminated
such
those
persons
who
had
been
tainted
by
that
excessive
coverage
that
you
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
can't
really
assume
that,
can
you?
suppose
a
trial
judge
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
by
which
time
he
had
seen
the
whole
panorama,
decided
that
this
could
have
been
a
miscarriage
of
justice
because
of
community
feeling
permeating
the
jury,
he
might
then
on
some
broad
ground
independent
of
the
statute
decide
to
grant
a
new
trial,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mrs.
dubois.
mr.
tinglum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tinglum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
it
get
in
the
record
with
the
label,
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
no
other
explanations,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
challenge
the
inclusion
of
this
item
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
best
it
should
have
been
labeled
proposed
or
something
of
that
kind,
should
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tinglum,
do
you
know
whether
it
is
or
is
not
in
the
original
record
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
record
before
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
that's
suggesting
you
have
a
responsibility
for
this,
you
did
not
bring
the
case
here
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
request
in
moving
papers
as
to
where
the
appropriate
venue
might
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
none
was
suggested
specifically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
recall
that
it's
a
motion
identified
the
source
of
the
editorials
as
the
milwaukee
journal
or
sent
in
any
other
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
presumably
can't,
doesn't
this
record
show
whether
the
year
had
run
or
if
it
had,
as
justice
black
suggested,
perhaps
the
tendency
of
the
appeal
had
suspended,
wouldn't
that
withhold
the
running
of
that
statute.
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
came
down
within
a
year
after
the
conviction
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
occur
to
me
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
writing
that
opinion
would
not
have
said
what
it
said
if
the
year
--
if
this
was
an
academic
exercise
if
the
year
had
already
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
[voice
overlap]
that
to
do
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
the
trial
did
end
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
dubois,
your
time
has
expired
but
we'll
extend
that
a
little
bit
so
that
you
can
offer
a
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
point,
isn't
that
the
conventional
way
if
you
are
asking
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
whole
category
at
least
to
suggest
by
way
of
proffer,
some
specific
instances
as
to
alert
the
court
to
the
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
interrupt
one
thing
in
the
last
page
with
your
appendix.
was
the
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin?
now,
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
footnote
in
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
new
trial
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
new
trial.
when
that
notice
of
appeal
was
filed,
i
would
surmise
must
be
what
is
on
the
reverse
side
of
the
certification,
the
third
of
april
6,
1969.
is
that
correct?
that's
233-a
and
234-a.
is
that
the
tape
then
on
which
you
perfected
an
appeal
to
this
court?
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
time
to
appeal
in
--
on
what
--
what
was
your
deadline
here?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
time,
the
one
year
had
expired
by
that
time?
had
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
could,
that
motion
could
have
been
made
after
the
judgment.
there's
still
time
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
