mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
mr.
chief
justice
---
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
first
of
all
just
to
mention
briefly
a
--
what
is
the
difference
of
opinion
about
the
statement
of
facts,
the
respondent
did
not
take
issue
in
its
brief
with
the
statement
of
facts
presented
in
the
appellants
brief.
the
misunderstanding
arises
in
this
fashion.
that
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
appellants
brief
contains
considerable
detail,
factual
detail
about
what
happened
at
the
trial,
what
the
testimony
of
this
witness
was
and
that
witness
was
and
our
disagreement
arises
and
that
the
respondent
takes
a
position
that
such
facts
do
not
have
any
relevance
whatsoever
with
respect
to
the
issue
which
the
appellant
seeks
to
raise
and
seeks
to
have
decided
by
this
court.
the
ground
rules
of
this
court
as
i
understand
them
and
as
expressed
by
this
court
in
mooney
versus
holohan
and
other
cases
is
that,
an
appellant
who
seeks
reversal
of
his
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
he
has
been
denied
a
constitutional
right
must
show
that
he
and
not
some
hypothetical
member
of
a
class
has
been
denied
due
process.
the
constitutional
right
the
appellant
seeks
to
have
indicated
here
is
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
that
is
a
jury
that
is
not
affected
by
community
prejudice
to
the
point
where
it
cannot
judge
the
issues
of
fact
impartially
in
the
case.
the
constitutional
right
is
sought
to
be
indicated
is
not
change
of
venue
but
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury.
now,
the
appellant
says
that
under
certain
circumstances
and
this
is
following
this
expression
or
something
similar
to
it
is
found
four
different
places
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
appellant.
the
court
is
told
that
under
certain
circumstances
a
change
of
venue
may
be
constitutionally
necessary
even
in
a
misdemeanor
case
to
protect
a
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
and
the
reason
we
contend
that
the
appellant
repeatedly
says
under
some
circumstances,
this
may
be
constitutionally
necessary
is
because
the
appellant
recognizes
that
this
court
has
not
been
given
a
factual
record,
a
factual
setting
in
which
against
which
the
constitutional
issue
can
be
decided.
the
question
that
the
appellant
seeks
to
raise
is
certainly
an
interesting
one,
it's
a
tantalizing
one.
there
is
not
much
law
previous
authority
on
the
subject.
there
will
apparently
be
less
in
the
future
because
of
the
trend
among
the
states
to
grant
changes
of
venue
in
all
criminal
cases
and
not
to
limit
the
right
to
change
venue
to
felonies
or
capital
crimes
or
make
such
other
distinctions.
it's
the
respondent's
position
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
give
an
advisory
opinion
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
the
past
that
it
does
not
seat
to
give
advisory
opinions.
now
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
this
case
decided,
made
a
decision
on
the
constitutional
issue
raised
and
argued
by
the
parties
in
that
court.
and
its
respondents
position
here
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
should
not
have
done
so
because
it
did
not
have
a
factual
record
that
would
raise
the
constitutional
issue.
no
one
to
my
knowledge
raised
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
the
question
of
standing
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
the
court
there
had
to
--
when
you
look
at
the
record
hand
to
deal
in
abstractions
and
this
court
have
said
in
the
past,
specifically
referring
the
united
public
workers
versus
mitchell
as
one
case
where
this
court
has
said
it
will
not
deal
in
abstractions
but
it
must
be
presented
with
concrete
legal
issues
in
factual
settings
before
it
will
undertake
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
all
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
justice
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
addressed
himself,
that
seem
to
address
himself
to
the
question
of
the
appellants
standing
to
raise
the
issue
of
constitutionality
was
mr.
chief
justice
hallows
that
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
expressed
on
opinion
on
the
constitutional
question
but
said
that
this
record
show
no
prejudice
and
therefore
we
would
vote
to
affirm
the
conviction
below.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
20-a
and
21-a
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
marshall
is
a
document
that
was
submitted
to
the
trial
court
at
the
time
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
change
the
venue.
the
defendant
as
i
understand
it
presented
this
document
at
20
and
21
to
the
trial
court
and
asked
the
court
to
sign
this
document
in
which
the
court
would
find
facts
that
where
more
or
less
in
accordance
with
the
affidavits
submitted
by
the
defendant
and
the
--
it's
also
my
understanding
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
pardon?
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
understand
it
was
a
separate
document.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
--
a
fugitive
document,
i
don't
know.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
know.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
did
not.
i
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
perhaps
should
have,
but
i
assumed
that
this
was
a
document
that
the
defendant
asked
the
trial
judge
to
sign
and
he
said
no,
i'm
not
going
to
sign
it,
you
can
file
it
if
you
want
but
i'm
not
going
to
sign
it.
but
i
assume
that's
how
it
found
its
way
in
to
the
record
but
i
don't
know
how.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
i
do
not.
again,
i
assume
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
know.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
the
prosecution
at
the
trial
court
level
took
the
position
that
it
would
--
that
a
change
of
venue
that
the
whole
question
of
the
change
of
venue
was
a
problematic
matter
for
legislative
regulation
and
that
the
wisconsin
legislature
had
only
acted
to
grant
the
right
to
change
venue
in
felony
cases.
the
prosecution
at
the
trial
court
level
took
the
position
that
in
as
much
as
the
legislature
had
not
granted,
extended
the
right
to
change
of
venue
to
misdemeanor
cases
that
it
would
resist
and
it
did
resist
and
opposed
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
now,
regardless
of
--
i
feel
with
somewhat
of
a
disadvantage
because
here
as
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
has
decided
the
very
issue
that
i
claim
it
would
not
be
proper
for
this
court
to
decide.
here
again
this
court
has
said
in
the
past,
in
the
tileston
case,
in
cramp
versus
board
of
public
instruction
that
this
court
will
exercise
its
independent
judgment
on
a
question
of
standing
and
will
not
simply
follow
the
lead
of
a
state
supreme
court.
the
court
has
stated
the
question
as
the
question
of
standing
as
being
one
of
whether
the
defendant
has
sustained
an
injury
by
the
statute
that
is
attacked
by
enforcement
of
the
statute
has
been
attacked.
the
record
in
this
case
when
you
compare
it
with
the
record
in
rideau,
irvin
versus
dowd,
estes
versus
texas,
shepherd
versus
maxwell.
the
record
here
doesn't
even
give
this
court
an
opportunity
to
say
that
--
well
it
was
even
comparable,
or
it
was
even
likely
that
this
defendant
had
to
go
before
a
jury
from
a
community
that
was
even
probably
prejudiced.
the
facts
simply
aren't
in
the
record.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
sir.
i
do
not
believe
so.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
said
that
there
was
no
bar
to
the
presentation
of
facts
at
the
trial
court
level
and
the
only
thing
we
find
is
the
--
this
affidavit
that
has
been
discussed
here
earlier
on
pages
23
--
24
and
25
which
is
in
very
general
conclusory
terms.
now
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
so
and
i
think
i
misunderstood
your
earlier
question
and
that
is
why
i
perhaps,
i
should
have
phrase
the
answer
differently.
the
state
could
not
have,
that
is
the
prosecution,
could
not
have
prevented
under
any
circumstances
could
not
have
prevented
the
defendant
from
making
a
record
of
facts
about
community
prejudice.
the
opportunity
was
therefore
the
defendant
in
the
first
place
to
file
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
mentioned
to
file
affidavits,
to
file
exhibits,
newspaper
clippings
being
denied.
that
opportunity
after
the
first
denial
of
the
motion,
the
defendant
had
many
other
opportunities
introduced
the
same
evidence
a
renewed
motion
for
change
of
venue
with
exhibits,
with
affidavits.
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
to
file
the
same
evidence
with
the
motion
for
continuance.
it
would
have
been
relevant
there.
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
to
file
the
same
type
of
evidence,
would
have
been
relevant
on
a
post
trial
or
post
verdict
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
community
prejudice.
furthermore,
the
defendant
didn't
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
record
that
courts
have
traditionally
considered
of
utmost
importance
in
community
prejudice
cases
and
that
is
a
record
on
the
voir
dire
examination.
there,
certainly
we
know
that
there
is
no
request
in
the
record,
anywhere
that
the
voir
dire
examination
be
reported.
we
have
to
assume
that
there
was
a
careful
examination
of
jurors
by
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
but
we
don't
know.
and
the
blame
for
this
can
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
defense
because
it's
the
defense's
responsibility
to
make
a
record.
if
it
is
going
to
stand
on
a
constitutional
issue
and
hopes
to
show
some
reviewing
court
that
the
defendant
was
denied
irrelevant
constitutional
right.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i'm
not
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
would
say
that
i
would
think
that
would
be
just
the
reversed
of
our
situation.
that
we
have
in
this
case
because
in
that
sort
of
a
case,
you
can
safely
assume
for
constitutional
purposes
that
the
film
was
the
worst
possible
kind
of
garbage
but
in
this
type
of
case,
you
cannot
assume
that
milwaukee
was
a
flame
with
prejudice
and
that
there
were
lynch
mobs
roving
the
streets
and
crowds
inside
and
outside
the
courthouse
yelling
for
the
defendant's
blood.
you
don't
have
any
of
the
facts
that
were
presented
in
the
records,
in
the
rideau
case
where
they
had
been
a
televised
confession.
you
don't
have
any
of
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
this
court
in
irvin
versus
dowd
or
in
shepherd
versus
maxwell.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
exactly
the
reverse
of
that
situation.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
and
it's
my
--
it's
the
respondent's
position
here
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
it
didn't
need
to
decide
that
and
shouldn't
have
because
it
didn't
have.
now,
if
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
believe
it
is
because
this
court
has
said
that
it
will
take
exercises
independent
judgment
on
the
matter
of
standing.
and
that
--
so
that
that
is
a
new
issue
and
we
don't
have
to
go
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
look
at
the
basis
of
their
decision
because
they
didn't
decide
that
issue.
looking
at
the
record,
all
we
know
about
this
case
was
that
there
was
an
arrest
at
the
end
of
august
1967.
there
were
six
postponements
along
the
way
that
cannot
be
laid
at
the
door
of
either
the
defense
or
the
prosecution.
one
of
them
was
caused
by
a
mistrial
but
there
were
a
number
of
postponements.
there
was
an
affidavit
of
prejudice
filed
against
the
judge
and
it
was
honored.
there
were
no
exhibits
filed,
there
was
no
renewal
of
the
motion
for
change
of
venue.
there
was
no
request
to
the
court
that
the
voir
dire
examination
be
reported.
the
voir
dire
was
conducted
and
finished
in
one
half
a
day.
the
jury
was
selected,
the
state
put
in
its
case
all
in
the
course
of
one
afternoon.
the
defense
put
in
its
case
the
following
morning
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no,
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
the
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
correct
and
that
they
might
have
a
very
valid
reason
for
wanting
a
speedy
trial
and
not
wanting
a
continuance
and
it
was
the
defendant's
right
to
insist
upon
observance
of
that
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
therefore
the
defendant
should
not
be
compelled
to
make
that
motion
in
order
to
make
a
record
of
community
prejudice.
that
is
the
defense
position.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
the
change
of
venue
would
involve
some
delay,
it
ordinarily
does.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
in
general
language
to
some
county,
as
i
recall
where
an
impartial
trial
may
be
had.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
county
was
suggested
specifically
and
the
motion
is
on
page
23.
the
motion
is
for
a
change
of
venue
to
a
county
where
a
community
prejudice
against
this
defendant
does
not
exist
but
there's
no
specific
county
mentioned
or
requested
by
the
defendant.
the
--
in
the
record
then
we
have
examined
what's
in
the
record
but
it
leaves
unanswered.
the
basic
question
of
was
there
a
prejudice
in
milwaukee?
was
there,
where
there
lynch
mobs?
was
there
the
tremendous
intensity
of
feeling
in
milwaukee
either
bearing
on
this
incident
or
other
incidents
in
the
defendant's
history?
where
there
crowds?
was
there
a
credible
atmosphere?
all
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
this
to
this
court
in
this
other
cases
that
are
relied
upon
by
the
defendant
were
in
the
record
but
they're
not
here.
we
don't
know
whether
the
editorials
mentioned
in
this
affidavit.
the
editorials
are
described
as
being
sometimes
critical
or
frequently
critical
of
the
defendant.
this
isn't
saying
that
an
editorial
has
condemned
this
man
or
has
prejudged
him
on
the
issue
of
his
guilt
of
innocence
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
sir,
it
did
not.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
obviously,
if
--
unless
the
trial
judge
had
been
so
tremendously
impressed
by
these
evidence
that
he
would
have
taken
a
more
careful,
look
at
the
statute
and
decided
to
construe
it
differently.
but
you're
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
the
filing
of
the
affidavits
and
of
the
rims
of
newspaper
clippings
if
there
were
such
with
the
--
as
an
exhibit
to
be
attached
to
this
motion
would
have
put
these
matters
of
record
in
this
case
and
would
have
given
a
reviewing
court
an
opportunity
to
look,
to
see
whether
there
was
a
likelihood
that
an
impartial
jury
could
not
be
impaneled
to
hear
this
case.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
if
the
issue
weren't
a
sixth
amendment
question
of
whether
or
not,
this
defendant
had
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal
by
an
impartial
jury.
the
issue
raised
and
the
only
basis
upon
which
a
reversal
could
be
predicated
is
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
and
so
this
court
has
required
in
the
past
even
in
the
rideau
case
and
in
shepherd
and
in
irvin
versus
dowd
has
required
that
there
be
something
in
the
record
so
that
this
court
could
say,
this
situation
was
so
bad
in
that
community
that
it's
likely.
we
don't
ask
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
sir.
i
have
to
make
that
argument
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
would
have
said
in
the
rideau
case
for
example
where
there
was
a
televised
confession.
if
the
record
brought
to
this
court
in
the
rideau
case,
had
had
nothing
in
it.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
by
showing
a
televised
confession,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
have
decided
the
rideau
case
the
way
it
did.
if
the
court
hadn't
known
about
a
televised
confession,
the
court
couldn't
have
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
got
to
be
some
offer
or
proof
with
some
specific,
yes
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
understand
that
paragraph
to
mean,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
court
was
saying,
if
counsel
was
convinced
that
there
was
serious
community
prejudice,
serious
enough
to
warrant
a
change
of
venue,
counsel
could
have
made
a
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
yes.
oh!
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
yes,
the
court
was
saying
that
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
within
that
one
year
period.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
within
the
one
year
period
following
the
conviction,
yes
sir.
that
time
is
now
elapsed.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
presumably
the
opportunity
to
file
that
motion
in
the
trial
court
was
still
there
at
the
time
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decision
was
rendered.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
it
did,
i
don't
have
the
date.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
to
put
on
that
paragraph.
i
believe
what
is
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
pardon,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
would
be
in
wisconsin
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
believe
this
appeal
to
this
court
would
toll,
would
extend
that
one
year
period
within
which
a
motion
can
be
made
to
vacate
a
judgment
in
wisconsin.
i
don't
--
that's
my
offhand
opinion.
i
don't
believe
it
would
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
occurs
to
me
too
but
i
just
don't
have
the
dates
in
mind.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no,
its
five
days
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
while
this
remedy
was
being
pursued
by
the
defendant
while
this
constitutional
issue
was
being
pursued
on
appeal.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question,
the
due
process
question,
i
believe
that
in
order
to
--
as
i
said
before,
in
order
to
even
reach
the
question,
you
have
to
begin
assuming
a
parade
of
horrible
facts
about
milwaukee
in
february
of
1968
which
is
the
respondent's
position
that
this
court
should
not
and
in
the
past
has
refused
to
do.
the
--
there
are
two
cases
other
than
this
current
case
in
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
i've
discussed
this
question
and
they're
both
against
our
position
with
respect
to
the
balance
of
the
argument
by
relying
on
their
brief.
thank
you.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
mr.
chief
justice
---
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
first
of
all
just
to
mention
briefly
a
--
what
is
the
difference
of
opinion
about
the
statement
of
facts,
the
respondent
did
not
take
issue
in
its
brief
with
the
statement
of
facts
presented
in
the
appellants
brief.
the
misunderstanding
arises
in
this
fashion.
that
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
appellants
brief
contains
considerable
detail,
factual
detail
about
what
happened
at
the
trial,
what
the
testimony
of
this
witness
was
and
that
witness
was
and
our
disagreement
arises
and
that
the
respondent
takes
a
position
that
such
facts
do
not
have
any
relevance
whatsoever
with
respect
to
the
issue
which
the
appellant
seeks
to
raise
and
seeks
to
have
decided
by
this
court.
the
ground
rules
of
this
court
as
i
understand
them
and
as
expressed
by
this
court
in
mooney
versus
holohan
and
other
cases
is
that,
an
appellant
who
seeks
reversal
of
his
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
he
has
been
denied
a
constitutional
right
must
show
that
he
and
not
some
hypothetical
member
of
a
class
has
been
denied
due
process.
the
constitutional
right
the
appellant
seeks
to
have
indicated
here
is
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
that
is
a
jury
that
is
not
affected
by
community
prejudice
to
the
point
where
it
cannot
judge
the
issues
of
fact
impartially
in
the
case.
the
constitutional
right
is
sought
to
be
indicated
is
not
change
of
venue
but
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury.
now,
the
appellant
says
that
under
certain
circumstances
and
this
is
following
this
expression
or
something
similar
to
it
is
found
four
different
places
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
appellant.
the
court
is
told
that
under
certain
circumstances
a
change
of
venue
may
be
constitutionally
necessary
even
in
a
misdemeanor
case
to
protect
a
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
and
the
reason
we
contend
that
the
appellant
repeatedly
says
under
some
circumstances,
this
may
be
constitutionally
necessary
is
because
the
appellant
recognizes
that
this
court
has
not
been
given
a
factual
record,
a
factual
setting
in
which
against
which
the
constitutional
issue
can
be
decided.
the
question
that
the
appellant
seeks
to
raise
is
certainly
an
interesting
one,
it's
a
tantalizing
one.
there
is
not
much
law
previous
authority
on
the
subject.
there
will
apparently
be
less
in
the
future
because
of
the
trend
among
the
states
to
grant
changes
of
venue
in
all
criminal
cases
and
not
to
limit
the
right
to
change
venue
to
felonies
or
capital
crimes
or
make
such
other
distinctions.
it's
the
respondent's
position
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
give
an
advisory
opinion
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
the
past
that
it
does
not
seat
to
give
advisory
opinions.
now
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
this
case
decided,
made
a
decision
on
the
constitutional
issue
raised
and
argued
by
the
parties
in
that
court.
and
its
respondents
position
here
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
should
not
have
done
so
because
it
did
not
have
a
factual
record
that
would
raise
the
constitutional
issue.
no
one
to
my
knowledge
raised
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
the
question
of
standing
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
the
court
there
had
to
--
when
you
look
at
the
record
hand
to
deal
in
abstractions
and
this
court
have
said
in
the
past,
specifically
referring
the
united
public
workers
versus
mitchell
as
one
case
where
this
court
has
said
it
will
not
deal
in
abstractions
but
it
must
be
presented
with
concrete
legal
issues
in
factual
settings
before
it
will
undertake
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
all
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
it
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
justice
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
addressed
himself,
that
seem
to
address
himself
to
the
question
of
the
appellants
standing
to
raise
the
issue
of
constitutionality
was
mr.
chief
justice
hallows
that
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
expressed
on
opinion
on
the
constitutional
question
but
said
that
this
record
show
no
prejudice
and
therefore
we
would
vote
to
affirm
the
conviction
below.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
20-a
and
21-a
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
marshall
is
a
document
that
was
submitted
to
the
trial
court
at
the
time
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
change
the
venue.
the
defendant
as
i
understand
it
presented
this
document
at
20
and
21
to
the
trial
court
and
asked
the
court
to
sign
this
document
in
which
the
court
would
find
facts
that
where
more
or
less
in
accordance
with
the
affidavits
submitted
by
the
defendant
and
the
--
it's
also
my
understanding
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
pardon?
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
understand
it
was
a
separate
document.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
--
a
fugitive
document,
i
don't
know.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
know.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
did
not.
i
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
perhaps
should
have,
but
i
assumed
that
this
was
a
document
that
the
defendant
asked
the
trial
judge
to
sign
and
he
said
no,
i'm
not
going
to
sign
it,
you
can
file
it
if
you
want
but
i'm
not
going
to
sign
it.
but
i
assume
that's
how
it
found
its
way
in
to
the
record
but
i
don't
know
how.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
i
do
not.
again,
i
assume
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
know.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
the
prosecution
at
the
trial
court
level
took
the
position
that
it
would
--
that
a
change
of
venue
that
the
whole
question
of
the
change
of
venue
was
a
problematic
matter
for
legislative
regulation
and
that
the
wisconsin
legislature
had
only
acted
to
grant
the
right
to
change
venue
in
felony
cases.
the
prosecution
at
the
trial
court
level
took
the
position
that
in
as
much
as
the
legislature
had
not
granted,
extended
the
right
to
change
of
venue
to
misdemeanor
cases
that
it
would
resist
and
it
did
resist
and
opposed
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
now,
regardless
of
--
i
feel
with
somewhat
of
a
disadvantage
because
here
as
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
has
decided
the
very
issue
that
i
claim
it
would
not
be
proper
for
this
court
to
decide.
here
again
this
court
has
said
in
the
past,
in
the
tileston
case,
in
cramp
versus
board
of
public
instruction
that
this
court
will
exercise
its
independent
judgment
on
a
question
of
standing
and
will
not
simply
follow
the
lead
of
a
state
supreme
court.
the
court
has
stated
the
question
as
the
question
of
standing
as
being
one
of
whether
the
defendant
has
sustained
an
injury
by
the
statute
that
is
attacked
by
enforcement
of
the
statute
has
been
attacked.
the
record
in
this
case
when
you
compare
it
with
the
record
in
rideau,
irvin
versus
dowd,
estes
versus
texas,
shepherd
versus
maxwell.
the
record
here
doesn't
even
give
this
court
an
opportunity
to
say
that
--
well
it
was
even
comparable,
or
it
was
even
likely
that
this
defendant
had
to
go
before
a
jury
from
a
community
that
was
even
probably
prejudiced.
the
facts
simply
aren't
in
the
record.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
sir.
i
do
not
believe
so.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
said
that
there
was
no
bar
to
the
presentation
of
facts
at
the
trial
court
level
and
the
only
thing
we
find
is
the
--
this
affidavit
that
has
been
discussed
here
earlier
on
pages
23
--
24
and
25
which
is
in
very
general
conclusory
terms.
now
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
so
and
i
think
i
misunderstood
your
earlier
question
and
that
is
why
i
perhaps,
i
should
have
phrase
the
answer
differently.
the
state
could
not
have,
that
is
the
prosecution,
could
not
have
prevented
under
any
circumstances
could
not
have
prevented
the
defendant
from
making
a
record
of
facts
about
community
prejudice.
the
opportunity
was
therefore
the
defendant
in
the
first
place
to
file
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
mentioned
to
file
affidavits,
to
file
exhibits,
newspaper
clippings
being
denied.
that
opportunity
after
the
first
denial
of
the
motion,
the
defendant
had
many
other
opportunities
introduced
the
same
evidence
a
renewed
motion
for
change
of
venue
with
exhibits,
with
affidavits.
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
to
file
the
same
evidence
with
the
motion
for
continuance.
it
would
have
been
relevant
there.
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
to
file
the
same
type
of
evidence,
would
have
been
relevant
on
a
post
trial
or
post
verdict
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
community
prejudice.
furthermore,
the
defendant
didn't
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
record
that
courts
have
traditionally
considered
of
utmost
importance
in
community
prejudice
cases
and
that
is
a
record
on
the
voir
dire
examination.
there,
certainly
we
know
that
there
is
no
request
in
the
record,
anywhere
that
the
voir
dire
examination
be
reported.
we
have
to
assume
that
there
was
a
careful
examination
of
jurors
by
defense
counsel
at
the
trial
but
we
don't
know.
and
the
blame
for
this
can
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
defense
because
it's
the
defense's
responsibility
to
make
a
record.
if
it
is
going
to
stand
on
a
constitutional
issue
and
hopes
to
show
some
reviewing
court
that
the
defendant
was
denied
irrelevant
constitutional
right.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i'm
not
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
would
say
that
i
would
think
that
would
be
just
the
reversed
of
our
situation.
that
we
have
in
this
case
because
in
that
sort
of
a
case,
you
can
safely
assume
for
constitutional
purposes
that
the
film
was
the
worst
possible
kind
of
garbage
but
in
this
type
of
case,
you
cannot
assume
that
milwaukee
was
a
flame
with
prejudice
and
that
there
were
lynch
mobs
roving
the
streets
and
crowds
inside
and
outside
the
courthouse
yelling
for
the
defendant's
blood.
you
don't
have
any
of
the
facts
that
were
presented
in
the
records,
in
the
rideau
case
where
they
had
been
a
televised
confession.
you
don't
have
any
of
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
this
court
in
irvin
versus
dowd
or
in
shepherd
versus
maxwell.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
exactly
the
reverse
of
that
situation.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
and
it's
my
--
it's
the
respondent's
position
here
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that
it
didn't
need
to
decide
that
and
shouldn't
have
because
it
didn't
have.
now,
if
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
believe
it
is
because
this
court
has
said
that
it
will
take
exercises
independent
judgment
on
the
matter
of
standing.
and
that
--
so
that
that
is
a
new
issue
and
we
don't
have
to
go
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
look
at
the
basis
of
their
decision
because
they
didn't
decide
that
issue.
looking
at
the
record,
all
we
know
about
this
case
was
that
there
was
an
arrest
at
the
end
of
august
1967.
there
were
six
postponements
along
the
way
that
cannot
be
laid
at
the
door
of
either
the
defense
or
the
prosecution.
one
of
them
was
caused
by
a
mistrial
but
there
were
a
number
of
postponements.
there
was
an
affidavit
of
prejudice
filed
against
the
judge
and
it
was
honored.
there
were
no
exhibits
filed,
there
was
no
renewal
of
the
motion
for
change
of
venue.
there
was
no
request
to
the
court
that
the
voir
dire
examination
be
reported.
the
voir
dire
was
conducted
and
finished
in
one
half
a
day.
the
jury
was
selected,
the
state
put
in
its
case
all
in
the
course
of
one
afternoon.
the
defense
put
in
its
case
the
following
morning
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no,
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
the
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
correct
and
that
they
might
have
a
very
valid
reason
for
wanting
a
speedy
trial
and
not
wanting
a
continuance
and
it
was
the
defendant's
right
to
insist
upon
observance
of
that
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
therefore
the
defendant
should
not
be
compelled
to
make
that
motion
in
order
to
make
a
record
of
community
prejudice.
that
is
the
defense
position.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
the
change
of
venue
would
involve
some
delay,
it
ordinarily
does.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
in
general
language
to
some
county,
as
i
recall
where
an
impartial
trial
may
be
had.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
county
was
suggested
specifically
and
the
motion
is
on
page
23.
the
motion
is
for
a
change
of
venue
to
a
county
where
a
community
prejudice
against
this
defendant
does
not
exist
but
there's
no
specific
county
mentioned
or
requested
by
the
defendant.
the
--
in
the
record
then
we
have
examined
what's
in
the
record
but
it
leaves
unanswered.
the
basic
question
of
was
there
a
prejudice
in
milwaukee?
was
there,
where
there
lynch
mobs?
was
there
the
tremendous
intensity
of
feeling
in
milwaukee
either
bearing
on
this
incident
or
other
incidents
in
the
defendant's
history?
where
there
crowds?
was
there
a
credible
atmosphere?
all
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
this
to
this
court
in
this
other
cases
that
are
relied
upon
by
the
defendant
were
in
the
record
but
they're
not
here.
we
don't
know
whether
the
editorials
mentioned
in
this
affidavit.
the
editorials
are
described
as
being
sometimes
critical
or
frequently
critical
of
the
defendant.
this
isn't
saying
that
an
editorial
has
condemned
this
man
or
has
prejudged
him
on
the
issue
of
his
guilt
of
innocence
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no
sir,
it
did
not.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
obviously,
if
--
unless
the
trial
judge
had
been
so
tremendously
impressed
by
these
evidence
that
he
would
have
taken
a
more
careful,
look
at
the
statute
and
decided
to
construe
it
differently.
but
you're
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
the
filing
of
the
affidavits
and
of
the
rims
of
newspaper
clippings
if
there
were
such
with
the
--
as
an
exhibit
to
be
attached
to
this
motion
would
have
put
these
matters
of
record
in
this
case
and
would
have
given
a
reviewing
court
an
opportunity
to
look,
to
see
whether
there
was
a
likelihood
that
an
impartial
jury
could
not
be
impaneled
to
hear
this
case.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
if
the
issue
weren't
a
sixth
amendment
question
of
whether
or
not,
this
defendant
had
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal
by
an
impartial
jury.
the
issue
raised
and
the
only
basis
upon
which
a
reversal
could
be
predicated
is
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
and
so
this
court
has
required
in
the
past
even
in
the
rideau
case
and
in
shepherd
and
in
irvin
versus
dowd
has
required
that
there
be
something
in
the
record
so
that
this
court
could
say,
this
situation
was
so
bad
in
that
community
that
it's
likely.
we
don't
ask
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes,
sir.
i
have
to
make
that
argument
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
would
have
said
in
the
rideau
case
for
example
where
there
was
a
televised
confession.
if
the
record
brought
to
this
court
in
the
rideau
case,
had
had
nothing
in
it.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
by
showing
a
televised
confession,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
have
decided
the
rideau
case
the
way
it
did.
if
the
court
hadn't
known
about
a
televised
confession,
the
court
couldn't
have
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
got
to
be
some
offer
or
proof
with
some
specific,
yes
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
understand
that
paragraph
to
mean,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
court
was
saying,
if
counsel
was
convinced
that
there
was
serious
community
prejudice,
serious
enough
to
warrant
a
change
of
venue,
counsel
could
have
made
a
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
that's
yes.
oh!
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
yes,
the
court
was
saying
that
that
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
within
that
one
year
period.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
within
the
one
year
period
following
the
conviction,
yes
sir.
that
time
is
now
elapsed.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
presumably
the
opportunity
to
file
that
motion
in
the
trial
court
was
still
there
at
the
time
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decision
was
rendered.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
it
did,
i
don't
have
the
date.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
believe
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
to
put
on
that
paragraph.
i
believe
what
is
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
pardon,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
would
be
in
wisconsin
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
i
don't
believe
this
appeal
to
this
court
would
toll,
would
extend
that
one
year
period
within
which
a
motion
can
be
made
to
vacate
a
judgment
in
wisconsin.
i
don't
--
that's
my
offhand
opinion.
i
don't
believe
it
would
sir.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
it
occurs
to
me
too
but
i
just
don't
have
the
dates
in
mind.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
no,
its
five
days
--
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
while
this
remedy
was
being
pursued
by
the
defendant
while
this
constitutional
issue
was
being
pursued
on
appeal.
mr.
sverre
o.
tinglum
yes.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question,
the
due
process
question,
i
believe
that
in
order
to
--
as
i
said
before,
in
order
to
even
reach
the
question,
you
have
to
begin
assuming
a
parade
of
horrible
facts
about
milwaukee
in
february
of
1968
which
is
the
respondent's
position
that
this
court
should
not
and
in
the
past
has
refused
to
do.
the
--
there
are
two
cases
other
than
this
current
case
in
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
i've
discussed
this
question
and
they're
both
against
our
position
with
respect
to
the
balance
of
the
argument
by
relying
on
their
brief.
thank
you.
