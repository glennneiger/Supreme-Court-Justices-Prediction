and
impartial
trial,
no
such
claim
has
been
made
in
this
court.
the
issue
can
be
passed,
raised
and
the
evidence
can
be
presented
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
based
on
a
denial
to
a
fair
and
impartial

what
do

you
could
raise
a
question
in
the
lower
court
now
as
to
whether
you've
been
denied.

question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
main
interest
i
have
and
it
is,
is
the
affirmance
of
the
supreme
court
to
be
read
as
meaning
that
even
now,
he
can
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
that
you
denied
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
reads
that
way.
