ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
it
involves
the
criminal
conviction
of
father
james
e.
groppi
from
resisting
arrest
during
a
civil
rights
demonstration
that
took
place
in
august
of
1967.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
prohibited
the
change
of
venue
in
father
groppi's
case
because
he
was
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
rather
than
a
felony.
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly
state
are
as
follows:
father
groppi,
a
roman
catholic
priest,
advisor
to
the
naacp
youth
council
and
an
active
civil
rights
leader
for
number
of
years
in
milwaukee
was
arrested
on
august
31,
1967.
he
was
charged
with
resisting
arrest,
a
misdemeanor
punishable
under
wisconsin
law
by
a
maximum
of
one
year
and
a
$500.00
fine.
he
was
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
february
9,
1968.
the
testimony
at
trial
just
laid
out
in
some
detail
in
our
brief,
is
significant
in
two
respects.
first,
it
is
clear
that
the
activities
out
of
which
his
criminal
charge
arose
were
considered
crimes
of
major
precautions
by
the
people
of
milwaukee,
whatever
the
technical
classification
of
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged.
thus,
the
defendant's
arrest
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
civil
rights
march,
protesting
a
proclamation
issued
by
the
mayor
of
milwaukee,
banning
all
marches
and
demonstrations
from
4
p.m.
to
9
a.m.
for
a
30-day
period.
that
proclamation
had
itself
been
issued
in
response
to
a
series
of
civil
rights
demonstrations,
marches
and
activities
participated
in
by
father
groppi
and
the
youth
council.
the
testimony
is
also
significant
in
that
the
states
and
the
defenses'
versions
of
the
facts
essential
to
his
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
resisting
arrest
charge
were
in
basic
conflict.
the
state
witnesses
testified
that
while
father
groppi
was
being
carried
in
a
limp
position
to
the
police
wagon.
he
kicked
the
policeman
who
was
carrying
him
by
the
left
leg,
meanwhile
shouting
a
profanity.
defense
witnesses
testified
that
that
same
officer
had
gouged
father
groppi's
leg
and
then
it
was
in
response
to
that
that
father
groppi
demanded
his
name
and
badge
number.
the
defense
denied
that
there've
been
any
kicking
or
any
profanity.
the
defendant
moved
prior
to
trial
for
change
of
venue
on
the
grounds
that
massive
and
prejudicial
news
coverage
that
he
had
received
as
a
civil
rights
leader
and
in
connection
with
this
case
in
milwaukee
county
had
created
community
prejudice
preventing
an
impartial
jury
trial
in
that
county.
he
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
the
nature
in
extent
of
that
news
coverage
and
its
effect
on
the
community
and
then
the
likelihood
of
an
impartial
trial
in
that
county.
this
motion
was
denied
for
that
in
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
wisconsin
statute
at
issue
prohibited
a
change
of
venue
in
misdemeanor
cases.
the
defendant
challenged
the
validity
and
constitutionality
of
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
today
your
honor
or
at
the
time
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
at
that
time,
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
trial
court
in
its
terms
prohibited.
the
trial
court
interpreted
that
very
specifically
to
prohibit
change
of
venue.
it
was
on
that
ground
such
denied
the
motion.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
its
opinion
again
interprets
that
statute
to
absolutely
prohibit
change
of
venue
in
a
misdemeanor
case.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
it
does
not
mention
it.
it
says
only
that
in
a
felony
case
of
change
of
venue
may
be
allowed
but
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
opinion
specifically
says
both
that
the
motion
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
provided
for
change
of
venue
only
in
felony
matters,
that's
208
of
the
record.
and
then
if
the
supreme
court
itself
said,
the
applicable
statute
specifies
that
a
change
of
venue
based
on
community
prejudice
shall
only
be
permitted
in
felony
cases.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
it's
our
contention
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
that
on
a
sufficient
showing
of
community
prejudice,
a
change
venue
may
be
constitutionally
required
and
that
these
such
statute
is
subject
to
due
process
challenge
because
it
absolutely
prohibits
change
of
venue
without
even
according
a
right
to
a
hearing
in
which
one
can
show
the
kind
of
community
prejudice
that
would
justify
change
of
venue.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
well,
i
think
it's
because
the
statute
--
the
language
of
the
statue
seems
to
assume
that
no
change
of
venue
exists
except
before
the
statute
and
that
it's
because
of
the
statute
that
a
change
of
venue
is
allowed
in
a
felony
case.
if
the
wisconsin
itself
recognized
a
federal
due
process
right
to
change
a
venue
only
after
the
statute
had
been
enacted.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
mean
that
in
a
particular
county
for
example
in
wisconsin,
it
might
be
a
special
misdemeanor
court
but
it
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
--
but
in
other
counties
there
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
if
there
was
a
showing
in
such
a
case
that
community
prejudice
was
such
that
it
was
impossible
to
try
that
misdemeanor
fairly
in
that
county
that
the
state
would
simply
have
to
provide
some
means
of
trying
them
in
other
county.
in
fact
that
a
specific
misdemeanor
court
did
not
exist,
it
seems
to
me
wouldn't
be
at
bar
to
that.
certainly,
another
court
would
be
able
to
try
the
case.
so
the
state
would
simply
be
inadvertent
of
providing
some
means
of
trying
it
somewhere
else,
if
it
was
going
to
try
the
case
at
all.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
well,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
impact
at
all
in
this
case
your
honor
because
the
wisconsin
statute
that
extended
that
change
the
law
if
we
refer
to
in
the
reply
brief
page
2,
footnote
1,
specifically
makes
that
change
in
the
law
perspective
only.
the
entire
--
the
section
we
quote
there
applies
to
the
entire
new
revised
criminal
procedure
code
and
it
says
that
the
code
shall
given
--
govern
prosecutions
commenced
on
or
after
july
1,
1970.
it
says
the
prosecutions
commenced
prior
to
july
1,
1970
shall
be
governed
by
the
law
existing
prior
thereto.
this
prosecution
was
commenced
before
that
day.
the
trial
itself
took
place
in
1968.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
on
the
original
motion
for
change
of
venue
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
pages
23
to
25,
the
defendant
offered
--
he
offered
--
he
asked
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
massive
news
coverage
of
this
defendant
and
of
this
particular
case.
in
addition
he
proffered
proof
as
to
the
nature
in
extent
of
the
coverage
and
as
to
the
effect
on
the
community.
the
motion
was
denied
without
hearing
in
the
specific
grounds
the
judge
gave
were
not
that
inadequate
evidence
had
been
produced
but
that
the
wisconsin
statute
prohibited
a
change
of
venue.
we
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
does
because
it's
our
contention
that
change
of
venue
may
in
some
cases
depending
on
the
circumstances
be
constitutionally
require
because
voir
dire
and
continuance
in
other
available
methods.
it
may
simply
not
be
adequate
to
protect
the
defendant's
right
to
an
impartial
jury
trial.
therefore
the
fact
that
in
a
particular
case,
voir
dire
may
be
in
expeditiously
dispatched
doesn't
affect
the
constitutional
claim.
the
periphery
challenges
were
all
exercised
in
this
case
and
there's
simply
no
way
of
telling
what
else
went
on
at
the
voir
dire.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
counsel
has
a
right
to
question
perspective
jurors.
the
reason
that
voir
dire,
when
the
state
makes
the
argument
that
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
to
show
community
prejudice
in
this
case
either
on
voir
dire
or
on
a
motion
for
continuance
or
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
it's
the
failure
to
do
this
that
deprives
them
of
standing.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
whereas
claim
constitutional
is
claim,
is
that
the
circumstances
are
such
that
only
a
change
of
venue
can
protect
his
right
to
an
impartial
trial.
there
is
no
reason
that
he
should
be
required
to
pursue
remedies
which
he
considers
inadequate
in
order
to
get
a
record
of
community
prejudice
into
the
case.
and
we
contend
this
is
so
particularly
because
pursuit
of
those
remedies
might
involve
waiver
of
vital
constitutional
rights
and
might
be
fruitless.
in
particular,
both
continuance
and
voir
dire,
continuance
under
wisconsin
law
had
the
defendant
move
for
a
continuance.
he
would
have
waived
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
secondly,
the
kind
of
proof
he
might
have
been
able
to
get
in
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
would
have
been
that
he
would
indeed
have
been
able
to
get
a
fair
trial
in
wisconsin
eventually
and
it's
not
a
very
thing
that
he
is
claiming
he
could
not
get.
as
far
as
voir
dire
is
concerned,
he
is
allowed
under
wisconsin
law
to
ask
questions
of
particular
jurors
or
presumably
is
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
they
heard
particular
information
of
same
things
but
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
bring
in
outside
witnesses
to
show
that
the
community
as
a
whole
was
exposed
to
prejudice
which
is
the
kind
of
evidence
to
this
court
found
in
rideau
was
relevant.
in
rideau,
this
court
found
that
it
was
not
the
exposure
of
the
three
jurors
that
was
showing
on
voir
dire
that
was
relevant.
it
found,
it
was
the
exposure
of
the
community
as
a
whole.
and
on
voir
dire,
there
would
be
no
way
in
wisconsin
or
in
any
jurisdiction
that
i
know
of,
that
the
defendant
could
show
that
kind
of
exposure
with
the
community
as
a
whole.
he
would
be
limited
to
showing
simply
exposure
of
particular
jurors.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
the
defendant
was
faced
with
a
statute
which
prohibited
as
wisconsin
courts
had
interpreted,
prohibited
a
change
of
venue.
he
did
make
on
--
he
made
conclusory
allegations.
he
asked
the
court
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no
your
honor,
he
could
have
been,
he
did
in
fact
file
an
affidavit
which
is
in
the
record
and
he
did
also
ask
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
news
coverage
which
courts
--
many
courts
have
in
this
kind
of
case,
considered
news
coverage
out
of
the
things
being
attached
but
the
most
important
thing
is
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
he
could
have
put
some
of
the
clippings
into
the
record
but
he
was
denied
any
opportunity
to
bring
in
witnesses
which
is
another
important
way
of
showing
the
community
prejudice.
it
was
denied
in
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no,
he
wasn't
your
honor
but
that
may
be
an
inadequate
way
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
--
of
showing
community
prejudice.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
would
agree.
if
either
the
trial
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
had
ruled
that
his
failure
to
get
community
prejudice
into
the
record
had
anything
to
do
with
his
failure
to
produce
proof
on
the
change
of
venue
motion
but
neither
of
them
win
on
those
grounds.
the
only
contention
--
the
trial
judge
on
that
motion
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
would
say
not
to
that
reason
your
honor
but
i
would
say
that
where
he
proffered
proof
that
--
and
where
the
trial
court
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
it's
on
page
23-a
of
the
record.
and
the
defendant
request
that
this
court
take
judicial
notice
of
the
massive
coverage
by
all
news
media
in
this
community
of
the
activities
of
this
defendant
and
such
activities
has
have
been
related
to
him
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
offer
proof
of
the
nature
in
extent
thereof,
its
effect
upon
this
community
and
on
the
right
of
defendant
to
an
impartial
jury
trial.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
neither
masses
of
news
paper
articles
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
and
none
of
them
were
attached.
that
is
true.
the
courts
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
where
not
---
no.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
the
defendant
was
faced
with
a
statute
prohibiting
change
of
venue.
he
came
in
and
proffered
proof
and
asked
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice.
he
also
attached
an
affidavit
by
father
groppi.
if
the
court
did
not
go
on
the
ground
that
these
things
were
inadequate,
if
the
court
at
that
point
had
said
these
are
inadequate,
the
defendant
could
have
produced
more
proofs.
but
what
the
court
rule
was,
that
he
had
no
right
whatsoever
to
produce
any
proof
and
that
it
did
not
even
rule
that
that
proof
was
inadequate.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no,
your
honor.
at
this
point,
and
if
the
only
appropriate
remedy
could
be
to
be
reversed
the
conviction
because
at
this
point
to
put
in
proof
that's
three
years
old
as
to
the
kind
of
community
prejudice
that
existed
in
what
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
want
the
court
to
reverse
the
conviction.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
a
reversal
so
that
the
defendant
could
have
a
new
trial
at
which
it
would
have
an
opportunity
to
show
the
kind
of
community
prejudice
which
would
justify
a
change
of
venue
of
indeed
under
circumstances
that
would
justify.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
it
had
never
been
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
but
i
believe
that
it
was
commonly
understood
like
counsel
in
wisconsin
that
this
was
not
allowed
and
the
changes
of
venue
were
not
allowed
in
misdemeanor
cases
and
this
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
do
not
believe,
is
that
ambiguous
because
it's
a
--
it
presumes
that
no
change
of
venue
was
allowed.
it
permits
change
of
venue
in
a
felony
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
that
the
statute
and
that
the
practice
in
wisconsin
was
fairly
clear
that
no
change
of
venue
would
be
allowed
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
defendant
produced.
i
do
not
think
that
--
and
i
think
he
produced
adequate
proof
in
any
and
even
an
adequate
proffer
for
the
said
that
the
judge
should
have
either
said
this
is
not
enough
evidence
or
allowed
him
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
there's
no
way
of
telling
exactly
what
kind
of
examination
was
made
in
this
case
but
under
wisconsin
law
as
under
the
law
in
most
jurisdictions.
the
juror
who
was
been
exposed
to
prejudicial
news
coverage,
they
stay
on
the
jury
so
long
as
he
can
tell
the
judge
that
he
has
not
formed
an
irrevocable
opinion
that
the
defendant
is
guilty.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
yes
there
was.
after
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
that
was
a
motion
again
before
trial
to
dismiss
challenging
the
statute.
there
was
also
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
after
its
challenging
the
statute
and
in
both
cases
the
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
at
that
stage,
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
but
again,
our
argument
is
that
the
reason
that
its
--
are
necessary
to
submit
evidence
or
that
it's
unfair
to
require
the
defendant
to
get
the
evidence
of
community
prejudice
in
at
that
stage
is
because
it
would
be
fruitless.
in
the
first
place,
in
a
motion
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
they
say
that
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
they
say
that
but
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
they
have
indicated
it
any
way
that
the
way
to
get
community
prejudice,
justifying
a
change
of
venue
at
the
record
is
on
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
there
are
several
cases
indicating
that
the
standard
for
reversal
on
a
fair
--
unfair
trial
theory
is
entirely
different
from
the
standard
on
the
change
of
venue.
in
the
case
of
state
versus
nutley
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
case.
they
described
the
two
different
standards
very
specifically.
they
described
then
that
the
standard
on
a
change
of
venue
motion
is
whether
there
is
community
prejudice
which
might
color
the
perceptions
of
the
jurors.
they
described
the
standard
on
the
reversal
for
an
unfair
trial
standard
as
whether
the
publicity
was
such
that
the
jurors
could
not
help
but
predetermine
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
assume
we
don't
think
it's
the
second
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
in
its
cases
that
it
would
not
be
a
standard
that
the
guilt
that
the
jurors
clearly
couldn't
help
but
predetermine
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
the
other
problem,
with
the
introducing
this
evidence
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
the
other
reason
that
it
would
be
fruitless
is
that
there
is
no
indication,
a
change
of
venue
would
be
possible
in
wisconsin
even
such
motion
will
want.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
he
might
decide
to
grant
a
new
trial
but
a
new
trial
in
the
same
community.
i
think
the
given
of
the
wisconsin
statute
denying
change
of
venue
and
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
their
granting
a
change
of
venue
and
it
says
groppi's
contention
in
this
case
that
a
simple
--
i
mean
granting
a
new
trial
under
those
circumstances
would
really
be
the
same
as
granting
a
continuance.
that's
his
contention
that
that
would
be
an
inadequate
remedy
because
of
--
in
the
circumstances,
particular
case
because
of
his
continued
civil
rights
activity
because
the
prejudice
really
resulted
from
his
notoriety
as
a
person
not
from
the
facts
of
the
particular
crime.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
prejudice
would
disappear.
in
any
event,
our
only
real
contention
is
that
he
was
entirely
at
least
to
unhearing
to
show
that
a
continuance
would
not
have
been
inadequate
remedy.
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
one
case
which
--
or
the
two
cases
which
have
really
dealt
with
the
statute
like
wisconsin's
both
held
that
on
the
record
where
the
defendant
had
no
opportunity
to
get
community
prejudice
in
at
the
change
of
venue
motion
hearing.
the
fact
that
there
was
no
community
prejudice
in
the
record
was
irrelevant.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
discuss
the
arguments.
our
basic
argument
is
the
statute
is
in
violation
of
the
defendant's
right
both
under
the
due
process
and
under
the
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
constitution.
we
start
with
the
fundamental
proposition
that
a
criminal
defendant
in
our
system
has
a
right
to
have
his
innocence
or
guilt
determined
on
the
evidence
by
an
impartial
trier
of
fact
whether
the
case
is
a
felony
or
misdemeanor,
a
serious
or
petty
offense.
since
wisconsin
law
provides
that
the
trial
of
fact
in
all
criminal
cases
be
a
jury,
it's
our
contention
that
the
defendant
had
a
federal
due
process
right
to
all
procedures
essential
to
ensure
that
that
jury
was
impartial.
the
court
below
and
the
state
contend
the
change
of
venue
has
only
one
or
several
methods
to
insure
jury
impartiality.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
other
methods
available
to
deal
with
pretrial
publicity
have
inherent
limitations
and
that
therefore
change
of
venue
may
under
some
circumstances
be
constitutionally
necessary.
continuance,
as
i've
said
may
be
ineffective
but
the
publicity
may
revive
and
that
it
conflicts
with
the
defendant's
right
to
a
jury
trial.
voir
dire
may
be
ineffective
for
reasons
i've
also
described
and
for
--
also
for
reasons
that
this
court
in
rideau
recognized.
in
rideau,
this
court
based
its
finding
that
due
process
required
a
change
of
venue.
in
that
case,
on
the
exposure
of
the
community
to
prejudicial
publicity
it
specifically
refused
to
base
its
finding
on
a
particularized
examination
of
the
transcript
of
the
voir
dire
proceedings.
if
change
of
venue
is
required
depending
on
the
circumstances
by
due
process,
then
we
contend
that
it
cannot
be
limited
to
felony
cases,
that
there
is
no
rational
for
this
distinction
because
as
this
case
indicates
community
prejudice
may
arise
from
the
personality
and
notoriety
of
the
individual,
rather
than
the
particular
crime
and
also
from
the
substance
of
the
activities
not
just
from
the
technical
charge.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
that
there's
no
way
of
knowing
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
only
way
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
i
think
if
we
prevail
that
the
solution
would
be
a
reversal
of
the
conviction,
the
new
trial
which
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
he
has
the
right
to
change
of
venue.
we
don't
claim
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
change
a
venue
in
this
case.
we
don't
know,
we
claim
here
as
a
right
to
have
a
hearing
in
which
he
can
introduce
evidence
to
show
that
and
under
the
new
statute
of
course,
he
now
would
have
that
right
in
any
event
also
under
this
court's
reversal.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
missed
the
beginning.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
would
say
that
--
no,
i
don't
answer
that
as
absolute
rule.
i
mean
i
can
imagine
that
there
might
be
circumstances
in
which
it
was
necessary
to
bring
in
people
from
the
community
to
actually
testify.
also
it's
been
recognized
that
one
of
the
--
you
know,
perhaps
best
ways
of
showing
community
prejudice
is
not
the
traditional
ways
that
have
been
used
in
the
past.
the
advice
is
but
some
kind
of
opinion
in
poe.
something,
i
think
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
mean
what
more
opportunity
than
there
was
in
this
case?
your
honor,
one
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no
your
honor,
it's
not
just
that.
it's
just
that
the
judge
would
not
deal
with
the
merits
of
the
situation.
the
judge
did
not
rule
that
he
would
refuse
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
massive
news
coverage.
he
did
not
rule
that
that
massive
news
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
the
affidavit
of
the
defendant
is
also
news
coverage
which
is
not
in
the
record
but
which
is
before
the
judge
and
which
the
judge
new
of.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases
i
believe.
well
in
the
case
like
coleman
versus
alabama
where
the
court
refused
to
consider
the
issue
or
hold
the
hearing
that
that
in
itself
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
what
we're
asking
is
the
refusal
not
just
to
hold
a
hearing
but
to
consider
the
issue
on
the
merits
that
is
the
denial
of
due
process.
that
in
the
contingent
of
the
state
ex
rel.
ricco
versus
biggs
case
which
was
cited
--
which
declared
unconstitutional
statute
like
this.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record.
all
that
happened
was
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
defendant
came
in
and
asked
for
change
of
venue.
the
court
said
that
it
wasn't
allowed
for.
it
was
ruled
that
he
had
a
chance
to
at
least
be
heard
on
the
merits.
this
judge,
it
wasn't
just
that
he
denied
on
the
hearing,
he
refused
to
decide
on
the
merits
that
this
coverage
which
he
knew
of
was
inadequate
or
that
the
coverage
should
have
been
brought
in.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
alright,
i
just
have
a
few
points
to
make
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
with
respect
to
new
trial,
i
just
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
under
the
two
cases
that
we
had
found
dealing
with
the
standards
from
reversal
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
was
unfair
on
a
motion
after
verdict.
the
standard
is
entirely
different
from
the
constitutionally
required
standard
for
a
change
of
venue.
one
case
is
state
versus
nutley,
says
that
reversal
for
an
unfair
trial
can
be
granted
only
with
the
publicity
with
such
that
the
jurors
could
not
help
but
predetermine
the
issue.
the
other
case
is
zelmer
versus
state
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
at
159
northwest
2d
669.
it's
a
1968
wisconsin
supreme
court
case.
it
says
that
you
can
reverse
only
if
the
court
is
convinced
that
the
defendant
should
not
have
been
found
guilty.
i
think
the
constitutional
standard
that
this
court
has
defined
in
cases
like
rideau,
irvin,
shepherd
and
a
number
of
others
is
a
standard
of
potential
for
prejudice
not
an
extreme
likelihood
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
found
guilty.
secondly,
on
the
continuance
remedy,
i
think
it's
clear
that
in
the
case
like
this
continuance
would
be
inadequate
unless
somebody
like
father
groppi
is
simply
to
stop
the
kind
of
civil
rights
activity
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
continues
to
be
engaged.
thirdly,
in
considering
the
adequacy
of
the
record
of
community
prejudice
made
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
is
not
an
entirely
new
issue
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
decide
that
in
rideau,
this
court
made
it
very
clear
the
change
of
venue
was
a
constitutionally
required
method
of
guaranteeing
theory
impartiality
in
certain
circumstances.
all
we
asked
for
below
and
all
we're
asking
for
it
now
is
the
chance
to
prove
those
circumstances.
finally,
as
the
few
points
with
respect
to
the
record
of
community
prejudice
in
this
court.
that
it
gets
important
to
recognize
that
when
the
defense
counsel
went
before
the
judge
in
this
case
and
asked
him
to
take
judicial
notice
of
adverse
news
coverage,
it
was
before
that
court
at
that
time
which
had
been
living
for
months
indeed
years
with
prejudicial
publicity
about
father
groppi
not
before
this
court.
secondly,
i
believe
it's
fairly
common
for
courts
to
take
judicial
notice
of
or
to
be
asked
to
take
judicial
notice
of
adverse
news
coverage
and
that
if
they
consider
that
inadequate,
want
to
see
it
or
want
some
kind
of
showing
that
they
can
ask
for
hearing.
thirdly,
on
the
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
i
think
your
honor
in
this
case.
the
defendant
did
suggest
both
in
his
affidavit
in
the
motion
and
also
in
those
proposed
findings
of
fact
which
you
asked
about.
the
kind
of
television
and
newspaper
coverage
and
to
answer
finally
specifically
that
question
about
the
proposed
findings
of
fact
that
appear,
i
think
it's
in
record
23.
they
were
rejected
in
the
record
at
page
9
is
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
and
the
court
rejected
those
charge
findings
of
fact
on
the
same
grounds
that
it
rejected
that
proffer
of
proof,
saying
in
page
9
that
change
of
venue
was
asked
for
and
the
motion
will
be
denied
and
not
being
provided
for
in
the
wisconsin
statutes.
also
filed
with
the
court
as
the
findings
of
fact
in
conclusion
of
law,
i
leave
that
unsigned.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
at
least,
i'm
not
sure.
i
only
know
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
came
down
shortly
before
the
expiration
of
the
year.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
may
6,
1969.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes,
your
honor
because
february
9,
1968
was
when
he
was
tried
so
it
had
expired
at
that
time.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
they
--
i
think
there
was
something
like
three
days,
three
or
four
days.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
there
had
been
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes,
there
was
a
motion
for
the
hearing
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
law
--
my
understanding
of
wisconsin
law
that
be
no
question
that
it
run
from
the
date
that
it
was
final
before,
that
it
wouldn't
run
from
this
courts
decision.
and
it
would
not
be
moved
now
for
new
trial.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
if
i
understand
your
honors
questions,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
defendant
would
not
now
be
able
to
move
for
a
new
trial
under
wisconsin
law,
his
year
has
run.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
the
words
of
the
wisconsin
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
although,
i
think
that
the
whole
remedy
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
something
that
under
wisconsin
law,
you
make
after
the
trial,
you
try
to
correct
certain
errors
or
ask
the
court
to
rule
again
on
certain
errors.
i
think
that
it
is
not
designed
to
provide
the
kind
of
remedy
for
change
of
venue.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
oh!
i
think
that
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
that
it's
perhaps
because
it
was
an
after
thought
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
had
never
before
that
opinion
suggested
that
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
the
proper
way
to
bring
in
community
prejudice
just
to
find
a
change
of
venue.
it
never
before
suggested
that
anything
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
in
order
to
justify
the
constitutionality
of
its
statute.
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
it
involves
the
criminal
conviction
of
father
james
e.
groppi
from
resisting
arrest
during
a
civil
rights
demonstration
that
took
place
in
august
of
1967.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
prohibited
the
change
of
venue
in
father
groppi's
case
because
he
was
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
rather
than
a
felony.
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly
state
are
as
follows:
father
groppi,
a
roman
catholic
priest,
advisor
to
the
naacp
youth
council
and
an
active
civil
rights
leader
for
number
of
years
in
milwaukee
was
arrested
on
august
31,
1967.
he
was
charged
with
resisting
arrest,
a
misdemeanor
punishable
under
wisconsin
law
by
a
maximum
of
one
year
and
a
$500.00
fine.
he
was
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
february
9,
1968.
the
testimony
at
trial
just
laid
out
in
some
detail
in
our
brief,
is
significant
in
two
respects.
first,
it
is
clear
that
the
activities
out
of
which
his
criminal
charge
arose
were
considered
crimes
of
major
precautions
by
the
people
of
milwaukee,
whatever
the
technical
classification
of
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged.
thus,
the
defendant's
arrest
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
civil
rights
march,
protesting
a
proclamation
issued
by
the
mayor
of
milwaukee,
banning
all
marches
and
demonstrations
from
4
p.m.
to
9
a.m.
for
a
30-day
period.
that
proclamation
had
itself
been
issued
in
response
to
a
series
of
civil
rights
demonstrations,
marches
and
activities
participated
in
by
father
groppi
and
the
youth
council.
the
testimony
is
also
significant
in
that
the
states
and
the
defenses'
versions
of
the
facts
essential
to
his
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
resisting
arrest
charge
were
in
basic
conflict.
the
state
witnesses
testified
that
while
father
groppi
was
being
carried
in
a
limp
position
to
the
police
wagon.
he
kicked
the
policeman
who
was
carrying
him
by
the
left
leg,
meanwhile
shouting
a
profanity.
defense
witnesses
testified
that
that
same
officer
had
gouged
father
groppi's
leg
and
then
it
was
in
response
to
that
that
father
groppi
demanded
his
name
and
badge
number.
the
defense
denied
that
there've
been
any
kicking
or
any
profanity.
the
defendant
moved
prior
to
trial
for
change
of
venue
on
the
grounds
that
massive
and
prejudicial
news
coverage
that
he
had
received
as
a
civil
rights
leader
and
in
connection
with
this
case
in
milwaukee
county
had
created
community
prejudice
preventing
an
impartial
jury
trial
in
that
county.
he
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
the
nature
in
extent
of
that
news
coverage
and
its
effect
on
the
community
and
then
the
likelihood
of
an
impartial
trial
in
that
county.
this
motion
was
denied
for
that
in
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
wisconsin
statute
at
issue
prohibited
a
change
of
venue
in
misdemeanor
cases.
the
defendant
challenged
the
validity
and
constitutionality
of
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
today
your
honor
or
at
the
time
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
at
that
time,
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
trial
court
in
its
terms
prohibited.
the
trial
court
interpreted
that
very
specifically
to
prohibit
change
of
venue.
it
was
on
that
ground
such
denied
the
motion.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
its
opinion
again
interprets
that
statute
to
absolutely
prohibit
change
of
venue
in
a
misdemeanor
case.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
it
does
not
mention
it.
it
says
only
that
in
a
felony
case
of
change
of
venue
may
be
allowed
but
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
opinion
specifically
says
both
that
the
motion
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
provided
for
change
of
venue
only
in
felony
matters,
that's
208
of
the
record.
and
then
if
the
supreme
court
itself
said,
the
applicable
statute
specifies
that
a
change
of
venue
based
on
community
prejudice
shall
only
be
permitted
in
felony
cases.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
it's
our
contention
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
that
on
a
sufficient
showing
of
community
prejudice,
a
change
venue
may
be
constitutionally
required
and
that
these
such
statute
is
subject
to
due
process
challenge
because
it
absolutely
prohibits
change
of
venue
without
even
according
a
right
to
a
hearing
in
which
one
can
show
the
kind
of
community
prejudice
that
would
justify
change
of
venue.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
well,
i
think
it's
because
the
statute
--
the
language
of
the
statue
seems
to
assume
that
no
change
of
venue
exists
except
before
the
statute
and
that
it's
because
of
the
statute
that
a
change
of
venue
is
allowed
in
a
felony
case.
if
the
wisconsin
itself
recognized
a
federal
due
process
right
to
change
a
venue
only
after
the
statute
had
been
enacted.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
mean
that
in
a
particular
county
for
example
in
wisconsin,
it
might
be
a
special
misdemeanor
court
but
it
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
--
but
in
other
counties
there
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
if
there
was
a
showing
in
such
a
case
that
community
prejudice
was
such
that
it
was
impossible
to
try
that
misdemeanor
fairly
in
that
county
that
the
state
would
simply
have
to
provide
some
means
of
trying
them
in
other
county.
in
fact
that
a
specific
misdemeanor
court
did
not
exist,
it
seems
to
me
wouldn't
be
at
bar
to
that.
certainly,
another
court
would
be
able
to
try
the
case.
so
the
state
would
simply
be
inadvertent
of
providing
some
means
of
trying
it
somewhere
else,
if
it
was
going
to
try
the
case
at
all.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
well,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
impact
at
all
in
this
case
your
honor
because
the
wisconsin
statute
that
extended
that
change
the
law
if
we
refer
to
in
the
reply
brief
page
2,
footnote
1,
specifically
makes
that
change
in
the
law
perspective
only.
the
entire
--
the
section
we
quote
there
applies
to
the
entire
new
revised
criminal
procedure
code
and
it
says
that
the
code
shall
given
--
govern
prosecutions
commenced
on
or
after
july
1,
1970.
it
says
the
prosecutions
commenced
prior
to
july
1,
1970
shall
be
governed
by
the
law
existing
prior
thereto.
this
prosecution
was
commenced
before
that
day.
the
trial
itself
took
place
in
1968.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
on
the
original
motion
for
change
of
venue
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
pages
23
to
25,
the
defendant
offered
--
he
offered
--
he
asked
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
massive
news
coverage
of
this
defendant
and
of
this
particular
case.
in
addition
he
proffered
proof
as
to
the
nature
in
extent
of
the
coverage
and
as
to
the
effect
on
the
community.
the
motion
was
denied
without
hearing
in
the
specific
grounds
the
judge
gave
were
not
that
inadequate
evidence
had
been
produced
but
that
the
wisconsin
statute
prohibited
a
change
of
venue.
we
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
does
because
it's
our
contention
that
change
of
venue
may
in
some
cases
depending
on
the
circumstances
be
constitutionally
require
because
voir
dire
and
continuance
in
other
available
methods.
it
may
simply
not
be
adequate
to
protect
the
defendant's
right
to
an
impartial
jury
trial.
therefore
the
fact
that
in
a
particular
case,
voir
dire
may
be
in
expeditiously
dispatched
doesn't
affect
the
constitutional
claim.
the
periphery
challenges
were
all
exercised
in
this
case
and
there's
simply
no
way
of
telling
what
else
went
on
at
the
voir
dire.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
counsel
has
a
right
to
question
perspective
jurors.
the
reason
that
voir
dire,
when
the
state
makes
the
argument
that
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
to
show
community
prejudice
in
this
case
either
on
voir
dire
or
on
a
motion
for
continuance
or
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
it's
the
failure
to
do
this
that
deprives
them
of
standing.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
whereas
claim
constitutional
is
claim,
is
that
the
circumstances
are
such
that
only
a
change
of
venue
can
protect
his
right
to
an
impartial
trial.
there
is
no
reason
that
he
should
be
required
to
pursue
remedies
which
he
considers
inadequate
in
order
to
get
a
record
of
community
prejudice
into
the
case.
and
we
contend
this
is
so
particularly
because
pursuit
of
those
remedies
might
involve
waiver
of
vital
constitutional
rights
and
might
be
fruitless.
in
particular,
both
continuance
and
voir
dire,
continuance
under
wisconsin
law
had
the
defendant
move
for
a
continuance.
he
would
have
waived
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
secondly,
the
kind
of
proof
he
might
have
been
able
to
get
in
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
would
have
been
that
he
would
indeed
have
been
able
to
get
a
fair
trial
in
wisconsin
eventually
and
it's
not
a
very
thing
that
he
is
claiming
he
could
not
get.
as
far
as
voir
dire
is
concerned,
he
is
allowed
under
wisconsin
law
to
ask
questions
of
particular
jurors
or
presumably
is
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
they
heard
particular
information
of
same
things
but
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
bring
in
outside
witnesses
to
show
that
the
community
as
a
whole
was
exposed
to
prejudice
which
is
the
kind
of
evidence
to
this
court
found
in
rideau
was
relevant.
in
rideau,
this
court
found
that
it
was
not
the
exposure
of
the
three
jurors
that
was
showing
on
voir
dire
that
was
relevant.
it
found,
it
was
the
exposure
of
the
community
as
a
whole.
and
on
voir
dire,
there
would
be
no
way
in
wisconsin
or
in
any
jurisdiction
that
i
know
of,
that
the
defendant
could
show
that
kind
of
exposure
with
the
community
as
a
whole.
he
would
be
limited
to
showing
simply
exposure
of
particular
jurors.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
the
defendant
was
faced
with
a
statute
which
prohibited
as
wisconsin
courts
had
interpreted,
prohibited
a
change
of
venue.
he
did
make
on
--
he
made
conclusory
allegations.
he
asked
the
court
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no
your
honor,
he
could
have
been,
he
did
in
fact
file
an
affidavit
which
is
in
the
record
and
he
did
also
ask
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
news
coverage
which
courts
--
many
courts
have
in
this
kind
of
case,
considered
news
coverage
out
of
the
things
being
attached
but
the
most
important
thing
is
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
he
could
have
put
some
of
the
clippings
into
the
record
but
he
was
denied
any
opportunity
to
bring
in
witnesses
which
is
another
important
way
of
showing
the
community
prejudice.
it
was
denied
in
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no,
he
wasn't
your
honor
but
that
may
be
an
inadequate
way
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
--
of
showing
community
prejudice.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
would
agree.
if
either
the
trial
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
had
ruled
that
his
failure
to
get
community
prejudice
into
the
record
had
anything
to
do
with
his
failure
to
produce
proof
on
the
change
of
venue
motion
but
neither
of
them
win
on
those
grounds.
the
only
contention
--
the
trial
judge
on
that
motion
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
would
say
not
to
that
reason
your
honor
but
i
would
say
that
where
he
proffered
proof
that
--
and
where
the
trial
court
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
it's
on
page
23-a
of
the
record.
and
the
defendant
request
that
this
court
take
judicial
notice
of
the
massive
coverage
by
all
news
media
in
this
community
of
the
activities
of
this
defendant
and
such
activities
has
have
been
related
to
him
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
offer
proof
of
the
nature
in
extent
thereof,
its
effect
upon
this
community
and
on
the
right
of
defendant
to
an
impartial
jury
trial.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
neither
masses
of
news
paper
articles
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
and
none
of
them
were
attached.
that
is
true.
the
courts
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
where
not
---
no.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
the
defendant
was
faced
with
a
statute
prohibiting
change
of
venue.
he
came
in
and
proffered
proof
and
asked
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice.
he
also
attached
an
affidavit
by
father
groppi.
if
the
court
did
not
go
on
the
ground
that
these
things
were
inadequate,
if
the
court
at
that
point
had
said
these
are
inadequate,
the
defendant
could
have
produced
more
proofs.
but
what
the
court
rule
was,
that
he
had
no
right
whatsoever
to
produce
any
proof
and
that
it
did
not
even
rule
that
that
proof
was
inadequate.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no,
your
honor.
at
this
point,
and
if
the
only
appropriate
remedy
could
be
to
be
reversed
the
conviction
because
at
this
point
to
put
in
proof
that's
three
years
old
as
to
the
kind
of
community
prejudice
that
existed
in
what
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
want
the
court
to
reverse
the
conviction.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
a
reversal
so
that
the
defendant
could
have
a
new
trial
at
which
it
would
have
an
opportunity
to
show
the
kind
of
community
prejudice
which
would
justify
a
change
of
venue
of
indeed
under
circumstances
that
would
justify.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
it
had
never
been
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
but
i
believe
that
it
was
commonly
understood
like
counsel
in
wisconsin
that
this
was
not
allowed
and
the
changes
of
venue
were
not
allowed
in
misdemeanor
cases
and
this
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
do
not
believe,
is
that
ambiguous
because
it's
a
--
it
presumes
that
no
change
of
venue
was
allowed.
it
permits
change
of
venue
in
a
felony
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
that
the
statute
and
that
the
practice
in
wisconsin
was
fairly
clear
that
no
change
of
venue
would
be
allowed
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
defendant
produced.
i
do
not
think
that
--
and
i
think
he
produced
adequate
proof
in
any
and
even
an
adequate
proffer
for
the
said
that
the
judge
should
have
either
said
this
is
not
enough
evidence
or
allowed
him
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
there's
no
way
of
telling
exactly
what
kind
of
examination
was
made
in
this
case
but
under
wisconsin
law
as
under
the
law
in
most
jurisdictions.
the
juror
who
was
been
exposed
to
prejudicial
news
coverage,
they
stay
on
the
jury
so
long
as
he
can
tell
the
judge
that
he
has
not
formed
an
irrevocable
opinion
that
the
defendant
is
guilty.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
yes
there
was.
after
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
that
was
a
motion
again
before
trial
to
dismiss
challenging
the
statute.
there
was
also
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
after
its
challenging
the
statute
and
in
both
cases
the
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
at
that
stage,
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
but
again,
our
argument
is
that
the
reason
that
its
--
are
necessary
to
submit
evidence
or
that
it's
unfair
to
require
the
defendant
to
get
the
evidence
of
community
prejudice
in
at
that
stage
is
because
it
would
be
fruitless.
in
the
first
place,
in
a
motion
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
they
say
that
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
they
say
that
but
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
they
have
indicated
it
any
way
that
the
way
to
get
community
prejudice,
justifying
a
change
of
venue
at
the
record
is
on
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
there
are
several
cases
indicating
that
the
standard
for
reversal
on
a
fair
--
unfair
trial
theory
is
entirely
different
from
the
standard
on
the
change
of
venue.
in
the
case
of
state
versus
nutley
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
case.
they
described
the
two
different
standards
very
specifically.
they
described
then
that
the
standard
on
a
change
of
venue
motion
is
whether
there
is
community
prejudice
which
might
color
the
perceptions
of
the
jurors.
they
described
the
standard
on
the
reversal
for
an
unfair
trial
standard
as
whether
the
publicity
was
such
that
the
jurors
could
not
help
but
predetermine
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
assume
we
don't
think
it's
the
second
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
in
its
cases
that
it
would
not
be
a
standard
that
the
guilt
that
the
jurors
clearly
couldn't
help
but
predetermine
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
the
other
problem,
with
the
introducing
this
evidence
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
the
other
reason
that
it
would
be
fruitless
is
that
there
is
no
indication,
a
change
of
venue
would
be
possible
in
wisconsin
even
such
motion
will
want.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
he
might
decide
to
grant
a
new
trial
but
a
new
trial
in
the
same
community.
i
think
the
given
of
the
wisconsin
statute
denying
change
of
venue
and
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
their
granting
a
change
of
venue
and
it
says
groppi's
contention
in
this
case
that
a
simple
--
i
mean
granting
a
new
trial
under
those
circumstances
would
really
be
the
same
as
granting
a
continuance.
that's
his
contention
that
that
would
be
an
inadequate
remedy
because
of
--
in
the
circumstances,
particular
case
because
of
his
continued
civil
rights
activity
because
the
prejudice
really
resulted
from
his
notoriety
as
a
person
not
from
the
facts
of
the
particular
crime.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
prejudice
would
disappear.
in
any
event,
our
only
real
contention
is
that
he
was
entirely
at
least
to
unhearing
to
show
that
a
continuance
would
not
have
been
inadequate
remedy.
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
one
case
which
--
or
the
two
cases
which
have
really
dealt
with
the
statute
like
wisconsin's
both
held
that
on
the
record
where
the
defendant
had
no
opportunity
to
get
community
prejudice
in
at
the
change
of
venue
motion
hearing.
the
fact
that
there
was
no
community
prejudice
in
the
record
was
irrelevant.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
discuss
the
arguments.
our
basic
argument
is
the
statute
is
in
violation
of
the
defendant's
right
both
under
the
due
process
and
under
the
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
constitution.
we
start
with
the
fundamental
proposition
that
a
criminal
defendant
in
our
system
has
a
right
to
have
his
innocence
or
guilt
determined
on
the
evidence
by
an
impartial
trier
of
fact
whether
the
case
is
a
felony
or
misdemeanor,
a
serious
or
petty
offense.
since
wisconsin
law
provides
that
the
trial
of
fact
in
all
criminal
cases
be
a
jury,
it's
our
contention
that
the
defendant
had
a
federal
due
process
right
to
all
procedures
essential
to
ensure
that
that
jury
was
impartial.
the
court
below
and
the
state
contend
the
change
of
venue
has
only
one
or
several
methods
to
insure
jury
impartiality.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
other
methods
available
to
deal
with
pretrial
publicity
have
inherent
limitations
and
that
therefore
change
of
venue
may
under
some
circumstances
be
constitutionally
necessary.
continuance,
as
i've
said
may
be
ineffective
but
the
publicity
may
revive
and
that
it
conflicts
with
the
defendant's
right
to
a
jury
trial.
voir
dire
may
be
ineffective
for
reasons
i've
also
described
and
for
--
also
for
reasons
that
this
court
in
rideau
recognized.
in
rideau,
this
court
based
its
finding
that
due
process
required
a
change
of
venue.
in
that
case,
on
the
exposure
of
the
community
to
prejudicial
publicity
it
specifically
refused
to
base
its
finding
on
a
particularized
examination
of
the
transcript
of
the
voir
dire
proceedings.
if
change
of
venue
is
required
depending
on
the
circumstances
by
due
process,
then
we
contend
that
it
cannot
be
limited
to
felony
cases,
that
there
is
no
rational
for
this
distinction
because
as
this
case
indicates
community
prejudice
may
arise
from
the
personality
and
notoriety
of
the
individual,
rather
than
the
particular
crime
and
also
from
the
substance
of
the
activities
not
just
from
the
technical
charge.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
that
there's
no
way
of
knowing
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
only
way
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
i
think
if
we
prevail
that
the
solution
would
be
a
reversal
of
the
conviction,
the
new
trial
which
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
he
has
the
right
to
change
of
venue.
we
don't
claim
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
change
a
venue
in
this
case.
we
don't
know,
we
claim
here
as
a
right
to
have
a
hearing
in
which
he
can
introduce
evidence
to
show
that
and
under
the
new
statute
of
course,
he
now
would
have
that
right
in
any
event
also
under
this
court's
reversal.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
missed
the
beginning.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
would
say
that
--
no,
i
don't
answer
that
as
absolute
rule.
i
mean
i
can
imagine
that
there
might
be
circumstances
in
which
it
was
necessary
to
bring
in
people
from
the
community
to
actually
testify.
also
it's
been
recognized
that
one
of
the
--
you
know,
perhaps
best
ways
of
showing
community
prejudice
is
not
the
traditional
ways
that
have
been
used
in
the
past.
the
advice
is
but
some
kind
of
opinion
in
poe.
something,
i
think
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
mean
what
more
opportunity
than
there
was
in
this
case?
your
honor,
one
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no
your
honor,
it's
not
just
that.
it's
just
that
the
judge
would
not
deal
with
the
merits
of
the
situation.
the
judge
did
not
rule
that
he
would
refuse
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
massive
news
coverage.
he
did
not
rule
that
that
massive
news
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
the
affidavit
of
the
defendant
is
also
news
coverage
which
is
not
in
the
record
but
which
is
before
the
judge
and
which
the
judge
new
of.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
your
honor,
this
court
has
held
in
other
cases
i
believe.
well
in
the
case
like
coleman
versus
alabama
where
the
court
refused
to
consider
the
issue
or
hold
the
hearing
that
that
in
itself
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
what
we're
asking
is
the
refusal
not
just
to
hold
a
hearing
but
to
consider
the
issue
on
the
merits
that
is
the
denial
of
due
process.
that
in
the
contingent
of
the
state
ex
rel.
ricco
versus
biggs
case
which
was
cited
--
which
declared
unconstitutional
statute
like
this.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record.
all
that
happened
was
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
defendant
came
in
and
asked
for
change
of
venue.
the
court
said
that
it
wasn't
allowed
for.
it
was
ruled
that
he
had
a
chance
to
at
least
be
heard
on
the
merits.
this
judge,
it
wasn't
just
that
he
denied
on
the
hearing,
he
refused
to
decide
on
the
merits
that
this
coverage
which
he
knew
of
was
inadequate
or
that
the
coverage
should
have
been
brought
in.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
alright,
i
just
have
a
few
points
to
make
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
with
respect
to
new
trial,
i
just
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
under
the
two
cases
that
we
had
found
dealing
with
the
standards
from
reversal
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
was
unfair
on
a
motion
after
verdict.
the
standard
is
entirely
different
from
the
constitutionally
required
standard
for
a
change
of
venue.
one
case
is
state
versus
nutley,
says
that
reversal
for
an
unfair
trial
can
be
granted
only
with
the
publicity
with
such
that
the
jurors
could
not
help
but
predetermine
the
issue.
the
other
case
is
zelmer
versus
state
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
at
159
northwest
2d
669.
it's
a
1968
wisconsin
supreme
court
case.
it
says
that
you
can
reverse
only
if
the
court
is
convinced
that
the
defendant
should
not
have
been
found
guilty.
i
think
the
constitutional
standard
that
this
court
has
defined
in
cases
like
rideau,
irvin,
shepherd
and
a
number
of
others
is
a
standard
of
potential
for
prejudice
not
an
extreme
likelihood
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
found
guilty.
secondly,
on
the
continuance
remedy,
i
think
it's
clear
that
in
the
case
like
this
continuance
would
be
inadequate
unless
somebody
like
father
groppi
is
simply
to
stop
the
kind
of
civil
rights
activity
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
continues
to
be
engaged.
thirdly,
in
considering
the
adequacy
of
the
record
of
community
prejudice
made
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
is
not
an
entirely
new
issue
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
decide
that
in
rideau,
this
court
made
it
very
clear
the
change
of
venue
was
a
constitutionally
required
method
of
guaranteeing
theory
impartiality
in
certain
circumstances.
all
we
asked
for
below
and
all
we're
asking
for
it
now
is
the
chance
to
prove
those
circumstances.
finally,
as
the
few
points
with
respect
to
the
record
of
community
prejudice
in
this
court.
that
it
gets
important
to
recognize
that
when
the
defense
counsel
went
before
the
judge
in
this
case
and
asked
him
to
take
judicial
notice
of
adverse
news
coverage,
it
was
before
that
court
at
that
time
which
had
been
living
for
months
indeed
years
with
prejudicial
publicity
about
father
groppi
not
before
this
court.
secondly,
i
believe
it's
fairly
common
for
courts
to
take
judicial
notice
of
or
to
be
asked
to
take
judicial
notice
of
adverse
news
coverage
and
that
if
they
consider
that
inadequate,
want
to
see
it
or
want
some
kind
of
showing
that
they
can
ask
for
hearing.
thirdly,
on
the
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
i
think
your
honor
in
this
case.
the
defendant
did
suggest
both
in
his
affidavit
in
the
motion
and
also
in
those
proposed
findings
of
fact
which
you
asked
about.
the
kind
of
television
and
newspaper
coverage
and
to
answer
finally
specifically
that
question
about
the
proposed
findings
of
fact
that
appear,
i
think
it's
in
record
23.
they
were
rejected
in
the
record
at
page
9
is
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
and
the
court
rejected
those
charge
findings
of
fact
on
the
same
grounds
that
it
rejected
that
proffer
of
proof,
saying
in
page
9
that
change
of
venue
was
asked
for
and
the
motion
will
be
denied
and
not
being
provided
for
in
the
wisconsin
statutes.
also
filed
with
the
court
as
the
findings
of
fact
in
conclusion
of
law,
i
leave
that
unsigned.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
at
least,
i'm
not
sure.
i
only
know
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
came
down
shortly
before
the
expiration
of
the
year.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
may
6,
1969.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes,
your
honor
because
february
9,
1968
was
when
he
was
tried
so
it
had
expired
at
that
time.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
they
--
i
think
there
was
something
like
three
days,
three
or
four
days.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
there
had
been
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes,
there
was
a
motion
for
the
hearing
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
law
--
my
understanding
of
wisconsin
law
that
be
no
question
that
it
run
from
the
date
that
it
was
final
before,
that
it
wouldn't
run
from
this
courts
decision.
and
it
would
not
be
moved
now
for
new
trial.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
if
i
understand
your
honors
questions,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
defendant
would
not
now
be
able
to
move
for
a
new
trial
under
wisconsin
law,
his
year
has
run.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
no.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
the
words
of
the
wisconsin
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
although,
i
think
that
the
whole
remedy
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
something
that
under
wisconsin
law,
you
make
after
the
trial,
you
try
to
correct
certain
errors
or
ask
the
court
to
rule
again
on
certain
errors.
i
think
that
it
is
not
designed
to
provide
the
kind
of
remedy
for
change
of
venue.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
oh!
i
think
that
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
i
think
that
it's
perhaps
because
it
was
an
after
thought
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
had
never
before
that
opinion
suggested
that
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
the
proper
way
to
bring
in
community
prejudice
just
to
find
a
change
of
venue.
it
never
before
suggested
that
anything
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
dubois
in
order
to
justify
the
constitutionality
of
its
statute.
thank
you.
