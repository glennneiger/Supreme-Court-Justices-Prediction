justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
dubois,
what
do
you
say
about
the
state's
point
that
it
wasn't
a
prima
facie
showing
in
the
motion,
it
was
just
general
conclusions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
any
rule
of
court
or
law
in
wisconsin
that
says
you
can't
file
exhibits
to
a
motion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
he
have
put
into
the
record
why
he
wanted
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
namely
the
clippings
that
he
said
was
so
declamatory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
denied
the
opportunity
to
put
in
a
thousand
affidavits
and
4500
clippings,
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
mean,
doesn't
the
court
get
some
control
over
the
fact
that
he
wants
a
prima
facie
showing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that
we
are
prohibited
from
affirming
on
that
ground?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
his
proffer
of
proof?
all
i
say
was
a
general
statement
which
asks
the
court
for
your
reason
to
infer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
which
in
those
paper
articles
are
you
asking
that
court
in
third
judicial
notice
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
article?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
you
want
the
court
to
go
back
and
research
from
the
newspapers
and
find
the
clippings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
sure
if
you
did
that,
it
would
have
been
much
simpler
to
have
presented
what
you
wanted
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
want
to
send
the
case
back
so
that
evidence
can
be
put
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
want
us
to
release
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
want
[voice
overlap].
you
want
just
to
out
--
an
out
reversal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
[voice
overlap]
you
didn't
say
you
wanted
complete
reversal,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
court
limited
due
to
affidavits
and
exhibits,
would
you
say
that's
a
denial
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
says
the
only
way
you
can
show
prejudice
is
by
affidavits
and
exhibits.
would
you
say
that's
a
denial
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
now
you
get,
what
more
you
want
than
you
had
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
only
complain
is
that
the
judge
would
not
let
you
put
on
evidence.
is
that
your
own?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
that
i
agree
on
for
the
sake
of
my
question,
but
made
no
effort
to.
he
couldn't
have
restricted
you
from
filing
exhibits.
he
couldn't
have
restricted
you
and
prohibited
you
from
filing
affidavits
and
we
would
have
had
something
to
go
on
but
here
all
we
have
is
the
affidavit
of
the
defendant
that
on
the
advice
of
his
lawyer,
he
didn't
think
he
could
get
a
fair
trial.
that's
all
we
have.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
just
want
to
read
the
milwaukee
newspaper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
page
20-a
and
21-a,
what
is
that
document?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
don't
you
know
why
it
was
charged
to
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
separate
documents?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
it
get
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
know
nothing
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
elapsed,
however
while
the
case
was
still
pending
in
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
