ms.
malvine
nathanson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
question
of
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
a
witness
before
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
bribery
conviction,
which
is
presently
being
appealed,
was
obtained
in
violation
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
further
in
violation
of
his
right
to
counsel,
under
the
federal
constitution.
in
about
march
of
1964,
the
petitioner
with
another
person,
were
arrested
for
an
assault
for
which
crime
they
were
subsequently
convicted.
on
the
same
day
that
they
were
arraigned
for
this
assault
charge,
they
allegedly
offered
a
bribe
to
the
arresting
police
officer
to
induce
the
officer
to
dispose
of
the
weapons
in
the
case
and
to
change
his
testimony
to
reveal
the
names
of
other
witnesses
and
so
on.
this
bribe
offer
was
fully
reported
to
the
district
attorney
in
march
of
1964.
they
obtained
a
mini-phone,
tape
recording
of
conversation
between
the
petitioner
and
the
police
officer,
and
all
of
these
was
in
the
hands
of
the
district
attorney
in
march
of
1964.
in
march
of
1965,
one
year
later,
while
the
petitioner
was
serving
his
sentence,
under
this
assault
conviction,
for
which
he
had
pleaded
guilty,
he
was
called
before
grand
jury,
which
was
reportedly
investigating
the
assault
that
had
been
committed
by
the
petitioner
and
the
conspiracies
arising
therefrom.
his
co-defendant
in
the
assault
case
was
called
first,
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment,
was
granted
immunity
and
testified.
the
petitioner
never
had
a
chance
to
plead
the
fifth
but
was
immediately
offered
immunity
--
was
voted
immunity.
immediately
prior
to
his
actual
testimony,
he
requested
to
see
his
lawyer
and
he
was
assured
by
the
district
attorney
conducting
the
investigation
that
he
had
nothing
to
worry
about.
he
was
being
fully
protected,
he
didn’t
need
a
lawyer
at
all,
and
so
he
testified.
four
days
later,
the
district
attorney
had
the
police
officer
to
whom
the
bribe
was
offered
come
in
and
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
several
months
later,
the
petitioner
who
had
been
told
that
he
was
being
fully
protected
was
indicted
for
bribery.
the
bribery
conviction
is
the
case
that
is
presently
on
appeal.
and
during
the
course
of
the
petitioner’s
grand
jury
testimony,
which
is
--
i
stated
was
given
under
a
grant
of
immunity.
he
was
asked
to
testify
about
the
particular
facts
surrounding
the
assault
itself.
what
weapons
were
used,
where
the
assault
took
place,
they
were
interested
in
who
would
hired
him.
the
petitioner
could
only
give
a
name
and
a
vague
description.
as
i
said,
he
was
asked
about
the
weapons
that
were
used.
he
was
asked
where
the
assault
took
place
and
so
on.
there
was,
i
may
point
out,
no
eyewitness
to
this
assault,
so
the
only
direct
evidence
of
the
assault
itself
would
have
to
come
either
from
the
victim
of
the
assault
or
the
petitioner
and
his
co-defendant.
the
police
officer
was
also
asked
about
the
assault
and
was
particularly
asked
about
what
petitioner
had
told
him
about
the
facts
of
the
assault.
and
the
police
officer’s
version
of
what
the
petitioner
told
him
jived
very,
very
closely
with
what
the
petitioner
had
testified
to.
as
it
turns
out,
the
petitioner
had
described
all
of
these
events
to
the
police
officer
during
the
course
of
making
the
bribe
offer,
for
which
the
petitioner
was
indicted.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
first
that
the
grand
jury
actually
relied
or
probably
relied
upon
the
petitioner’s
testimony,
when
they
decided
to
indict
him
for
bribery.
it
is
secondly
our
position
that
the
petitioner
should
have
been
protected
from
indictment
for
bribery,
because
under
the
constitution,
as
you
can
see
he
had
been
compelled
to
testify
to
matters
relevant
to
the
bribery.
he
had
to
be
given
protection
for
such
a
prosecution
and
it
is
further
our
position
that
the
petitioner
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
consult
with
his
attorney
before
he
testified
and
as
a
result
the
indictment
that
was
obtained
must
be
dismissed.
we
submit
that
the
grand
jury,
in
fact,
actually
relied
upon
the
petitioner’s
testimony.
he
used
the
petitioner’s
testimony
as
a
basis
for
indicting
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner’s
testimony
supplied
the
grand
jury
with
a
motive
for
the
bribe
offer
to
which
the
officer
would
later
testify.
and
although,
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
motive
may
not
be
a
necessary
element
of
the
crime
of
bribery,
it’s
certainly
easier
to
get
a
conviction
and
we
submit
easier
to
get
an
indictment
if
the
prosecuting
agency
is
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
motive.
and
so,
the
petitioner’s
admission
that
he
had
committed
the
assault
and
that
he
committed
the
assault
with
the
weapons
that
the
police
officer
later
said
he
was
suppose
to
dispose
of
it
in
some
way.
but
we
think
was
crucial
in
this
case
and
may
very
--
there
was
a
strong
likelihood
that
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
indict
was
in
fact
based
upon
the
grand
jury’s
knowledge
that
there
was
a
strong
motive
for
bribery
in
this
case.
it
is
further
out
position
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner’s
testimony
jives
so
closely
with
the
police
officer’s
version
of
what
the
petitioner
had
told
him
made
the
police
officer
more
credible
to
the
grand
jury.
they
didn’t
have
to
believe
the
police
officer.
he
hadn’t
seen
the
assault
and
so
that
all
that
he
could
testify
to
really
was
what
the
petitioner
told
him.
and
it
wasn’t
necessary
that
they
believe
the
police
officer,
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner’s
testimony
supported
the
police
officer’s
testimony
in
so
many
respects,
they
also
have
led
to
the
grand
jury
decision
that
in
fact,
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
bribery
and
should
be
indicted
therefore.
in
addition,
there’s
always
a
possibility
that
the
grand
jury
saw
the
petitioner,
made
an
evaluation
of
his
character,
of
his
demeanor,
of
his
honesty,
of
his
forthrightness,
and
in
view
of
their
evaluation
of
his
character
determined
that
he
had
committed
the
bribery
and
therefore
should
be
indicted
for.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
no,
it's
our
position
that
a
person
who
has
been
forced
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
forced
to
give
up
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
should
not
be
indicted
by
that
same
grand
jury.
particularly,
not
in
the
case
like
this,
where
the
subject
matter
of
his
testimony
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment
are
so
close.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
i
--
this
certainly
is
a
problem
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
a
grand
jury
will
take
a
claim
of
privileges
being
some
sort
of
an
admission
of
guilt.
the
several
cases
which
we
relied
upon
which
established
that
--
which
stated
that
the
grand
jury
may
be
affected
by
the
considerations
i
have
mentioned,
point
this
out
as
well.
this
is
a
chance
that
a
man
must
take
if
he
wishes
to
assert
his
privilege.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
once
he
has
been
--
his
privilege
has
been
taken
away
from
him,
and
he
has
been
told
that
he
would
be
protected
and
the
grand
jury
should
be
entitled
to
rely
upon
these
factors.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
on
point
one,
i
would
not
be
here.
certainly,
however,
the
remainder
of
my
argument
would
be
equally
valid.
but
i
certainly
agree
if
it
a
different
grand
jury
than
the
problem
i
raised
in
the
first
point
of
my
brief
would
not
exist.
but
in
fact,
he
was
indicted
by
this
very
same
grand
jury.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
between
--
i’m
sorry,
between
what?
ms.
malvine
nathanson
in
the
indictment?
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
he
appeared
in
march
of
1965
and
he
was
indicted
in
july
of
1965,
as
a
formal
matter.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
your
honor,
there
is
no
way,
there
is
certainly
no
way
of
defense
counsel
to
be
aware
of
the
names
who
appeared
in
the
grand
jury.
there
is
however,
the
statutory
framework
in
new
york
would
require
that
there
at
least
be
seven
people
there
at
the
same
time.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
no,
no,
i
didn’t
make
myself
clear.
the
grand
jury
system
provides
that
there
are
23
people,
16
to
23
people
on
the
grand
jury.
but
16
are
necessary
for
a
quorum.
so,
there
must
be
16
of
23
present
on
each
occasion.
in
addition,
there
can
be
no
indictment,
except
by
the
concurrence
of
12
of
those
minimum
16.
and
if
we
work
out
the
numbers,
at
least
seven
people
must
be
identical
in
any
two
sittings
of
the
grand
jury.
there
would
be
no
way
of
having
it
be
a
completely
different
group
of
people.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
seven
is
a
majority
of
12,
which
is
what
we
required
to
indict.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
23
maximum,
16
for
a
quorum
and
12
to
indict.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
we
just
don’t
know
what
happened
in
this
occasion.
this
information
is
not
available,
but
there
certainly
were
many
people,
who
heard
both
the
testimony.
that
testimony
was
four
days
apart
over
a
weekend,
the
police
officer
and
the
petitioner.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
no,
your
honor,
but
where
the
witness’
testimony
has
some
relevance,
so
that
their
evaluation
of
this
witness
would
directly
bear
upon
the
subsequent
indictment,
then
they
can't.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
your
honor,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
that
one
of
the
factors,
which
not
only
in
this
case
was
the
defendant
in
fact,
the
petitioner
in
fact
testify
to
the
same
matter
that
the
patrol
man
later
testified
too,
and
that
form
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment.
but
in
addition,
the
grand
jury
may
have
evaluated
his
demeanor
and
so
on.
this
is
not
–
i
am
not
saying
this
would
be
a
sufficient
ground
for
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
but
i
believe
it
is
another
factor
in
the
context
to
this
case,
which
should
be
considered.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
the
result
would
be
the
same.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
about
seven
months
after
their
decision
in
this
case,
overruled
this
case
and
so
far
it
has
set
down
certain
general
legal
principles.
however,
they
stated
that
they
had
taken
another
look
at
the
record.
what
they
said
was
this
is
not
to
say
we
have
decided
piccirillo
incorrectly,
because
in
fact,
in
piccirillo,
the
legal
testimonies
that
we’re
setting
down
now
would
not
absolve
them
of
this
conviction.
there
is
certainly
no
question
that
this
court
of
appeals
has
in
fact
considered
piccirillo
in
light
of
its
subsequent
decision
in
people
again
--
the
matter
of
menna,
which
i
assume
that
you
are
alluding
to,
and
has
reaffirmed
its
decision
in
piccirillo
as
to
the
result.
they
have
again
found
that
mr.
piccirillo’s
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
were
not
violated.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
subsequent
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
purports
to
adopt
what
we
say,
is
a
federal
constitutional
rule.
really,
there's
no
more
than
pay
lip
service
to
that
federal
constitutional
rule,
i
think
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
way
they
apply
that
rule
in
this
case.
the
spirit
with
which
they
apply,
the
federal
constitutional
rule
does
not
give
its
full
effect,
to
the
effect
that
we
believe
it
should
have
with
regard
to
the
second
point
of
my
brief.
this
is
of
the
transactional
immunity
rule
that
we
assert
is
required
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
is
that
a
witness
who
is
compelled
to
give
up
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
must
be
guaranteed
that
he
will
be
immune
from
prosecution
by
the
compelling
jurisdiction,
as
to
any
transaction
relevant
to
his
testimony.
this
is
commonly
known
as
the
transactional
immunity
rule.
it
is
our
position
that
this
the
rule
that
was
first
enunciated
in
the
first
occasion
in
this
court
to
deal
with
the
question
of
immunity
and
the
abrogation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
counselman
v.
hitchcock.
it
has
been
constantly
reiterated,
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
and
we
believe
is
a
very
sound
rule.
the
rationale
for
the
rule,
i
think
is
quite
simple.
the
fifth
amendment
states
very
explicitly,
“no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself.”
there's
no
ifs,
and,
buts,
no
qualifications.
only
if
the
incriminatory
aspect
of
his
testimony
can
be
removed,
if
in
fact
as
he
testifies,
he
is
not
subject
to
any
criminal
prosecution
that
could
be
based
on
his
testimony.
only
then
can
you
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
no
longer
applies
and
he
may
be
forced
to
testify.
and
we
submit
that
this
can
only
done
by
granting
him
immunity
as
to
any
crime,
which
could
be
related
to
his
testimony
and
which
could
be
proved
through
his
testimony
worthily
leads.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
exclusionary
rule
with
the
district
attorney
contends
this
as
a
sufficient
rule,
under
the
constitution,
is
in
fact
a
sufficient
rule.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
yes.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
oh!
no,
no,
immunity
would
only
protect
somebody
up
to
the
point
of
its
testimony.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
yes,
i
do.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
your
question
and
i
thought
you
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
subsequent
to
the
bribe,
and
not
subsequent
to
his
testimony.
that’s
what
i
misunderstood,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
certainly
not
subsequent
to
his
testimony,
because
his
immunity
at
the
time
of
his
testimony
would
only
cover
what
had
happened
before.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
on
the
basis
of
your
question
and
without
having
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
analyze
the
facts,
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
covered
by
the
transaction
immunity.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well
actually,
in
new
york,
i
believe
that
kidnapping
is
not
covered
by
immunity,
and
nobody
would
have
power
to
grant
him
immunity
in
an
investigation
of
that
sort.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
--
without
a
chance
to
actually
analyze
the
testimony,
because
i
think
it
all
depends
on
exactly
what
he
testified
to
and
is
it
substantially
related
to
the
crime
for
which
he
is
being
prosecuted.
and
to
be
perfectly
honest,
i
would
have
to
sit
down,
read
his
testimony,
take
a
look
at
the
facts
of
the
crime
and
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
substantial
relation
and
this
is
hypothetical,
because
i
haven’t
previously
considered.
but
this
would
be
the
test,
and
if
after
analysis
it
would
be
determined
that
the
testimony
that
he
gave
was
substantially
related
to
the
beating
up
of
the
children.
then,
it
certainly
would
be
covered.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
it’s
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
that’s
right.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
but
the
test
is
not
--
is
not
whether
there
might
be
a
similar
motivation
between
the
two
crimes
or
anything
like
that.
the
test
is
his
testimony
itself,
what
he
said
in
the
grand
jury
are
the
words
that
he
uttered
substantially
related
to
the
subsequent
crime.
and
in
fact,
they
are
substantially
related.
then
under
this
court’s
holding
in
heike
he
would
be
covered,
under
a
transaction
immunity
standard.
i
would
hesitate
at
this
moment
to
make
that
evaluation
of
a
hypothetical
that
i,
you
know,
had
not
had
chance
to
evaluate.
it
is
our
position
certainly
in
this
case
that
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
and
the
bribery
prosecution
that
was
subsequently
commenced.
for
the
same
reasons
that
we
feel
that
the
testimony
could
in
fact
have
been
relied
upon
by
the
grand
jury
in
indicting,
that
kind
of
create
the
same
kind
of
relevancy.
the
testimony
established
the
motive
for
the
bribe
offer.
it
was
in
fact
about
the
same
tire
irons
that
had
been
used
during
the
assault
and
that
were
the
subject
matter
of
a
bribe
offer.
so,
we
feel
there's
no
question,
but
if
there
was
a
substantial
relationship
and
that
under
the
transaction
immunity
test,
which
we
contend
as
a
federal
constitutional
test
and
as
it
has
been
explained
by
this
court
in
heike
and
applied
in
other
cases,
the
bribery
indictment
must
be
found
to
have
been
covered
by
the
transaction
immunity
to
which
this
petitioner
was
entitled.
it
is
finally
our
contention
that
the
petitioner’s
right
to
counsel
was
very
seriously
abrogated
in
this
case.
as
i
mentioned
before,
prior
to
his
giving
any
testimony,
he
asked
if
he
could
speak
to
his
lawyer.
and
he
was
told
by
the
--
or
whether
he
stated
that
he
would
like
to
speak
to
his
lawyer
first.
and
he
was
by
told
by
the
district
attorney,
who
is
in-charge
of
the
case,
that
this
would
not
be
necessary.
in
effect,
what
mr.
piccirillo
told
him
after
he
asked
for
his
lawyer,
he
said,
“under
these
circumstances
you
are
not
a
defendant,
you
are
a
witness,”
this
is
at
page
7
of
my
brief,
“you
have
been
given
immunity
that
means
you
cannot
be
prosecuted.
your
rights
are
fully
protected
and
there’s
no
reason
for
your
conferring
with
your
attorney.”
now,
of
course
they
pointed
that
the
man
was
indicted
by
the
same
grand
jury
several
months
later.
and
i
think
there
is
at
least
a
very
serious
question
whether
some
of
his
rights
were
being
affected
during
his
grand
jury
proceeding.
and
perhaps
the
advice
of
counsel
might
have
been
helpful
to
him.
at
the
very
least,
counsel
might
have
clarified
for
him
what
this
immunity.
they
were
talking
about
was
about
as
the
question
mr.
blackmun
--
mr.
justice
blackmun
points
out
there
is
somewhat
of
a
problem,
where
has
been
in
new
york
state
as
to
what
the
immunity
standard
should
be
to
compare
this
case
with
the
subsequently
decided
case
of
matter
of
menna.
the
advice
given
by
the
district
attorney
himself,
his
definition
of
what
the
immunity
would
be,
kind
of
veers
between
a
testimonial
standard
and
a
transactional
immunity
standard.
we
also
submit
that
a
counsel
could
have
been
important
perhaps
even
in
negotiating,
an
additional
amount
of
immunity
for
his
client,
which
is
certainly
a
perfectly
appropriate
role
of
counsel,
if
counsel
can
accomplish
this
sort
of
thing.
counsel
could
at
least
have
made
clear
to
petitioner,
what
was
being
covered
and
what
was
not
being
covered.
now,
all
the
parties
in
this
proceeding
knew
about
the
bribery.
the
da
had
had
information
about
this
bribery,
at
least
a
year
before,
when
it
has
first
occurred.
he
had
mini-phone,
he
had
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
the
statements
of
the
police
officer.
the
lawyer
for
the
petitioner
knew
about
the
bribe
offer
and
obviously
petitioner
knew
about
the
bribe
offer.
certainly,
the
parties
involved
could
have
clarified
whether
or
not
the
district
attorney
thought
that
this
bribe
offer
was
being
covered
by
this
offer
of
immunity.
and,
if
in
fact,
it
was
not
being
covered,
petitioner
may
just
not
want
to
have
given
up
his
privilege,
he
may
have
rather
subject
himself
to
a
contempt
for
execution,
which
i
submit
it's
just
perfect
right
to
do.
even
with
the
grant
of
immunity
there
is
no
reason
why
a
man
can't
elect
to
go
to
jail
for
contempt,
rather
than
perhaps
get
into
worst
trouble
by
being
indicted
for
substantive
crime.
and
so,
we
think
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
counsel
could
have
done
during
these
proceedings
to
advise
the
petitioner,
to
assist
him,
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
district
attorney
and
to
have
been
able
the
petitioner
to
make
a
considered
reason,
well-informed
decision
as
to
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
do
when
called
before
the
grand
jury.
and
the
district
attorney’s
cavalier
dismissal
of
his
request
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
with
the
assurance
that
he
had
nothing
to
worry
about
and
he
was
being
fully
protected.
this
points
up
the
need
that
this
petitioner
had
for
a
lawyer
to
advise
him.
and
so,
it's
our
position
that
for
these
three
reasons,
the
fact
that
his
testimony,
his
compelled
testimony,
in
fact,
was
used
in
obtaining
the
indictment.
the
fact
that
he
should
have
been
given
an
immunity
that
would
cover
the
bribery
prosecution
under
the
transaction
immunity
standard,
the
fact
that
he
was
deprived
his
right
to
counsel,
all
require
that
the
conviction
of
this
case
be
reversed.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
on
this
question
of
the
effect
of
the
rule
that
we
state
as
constitutional
required
upon
criminal
prosecutions
throughout
this
entire
country,
first,
i
believe
the
district
attorney
has
misinterpreted
what
we
state
as
constitutionally
required.
the
counselman
rule
as
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief,
refers
to
the
requirement
that
the
compelling
jurisdiction
--
compelling
jurisdiction
grant
transactional
immunity
to
the
witness.
the
murphy
situation
of
course
was
a
case
where
the
compelling
jurisdiction
and
the
using
jurisdiction,
or
potentially
using
jurisdiction,
were
two
different
places.
it
is
not
the
situation
on
this
case
but
that
distinction
is
very
important.
we
have
not
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
we
have
not
proposed
that
a
jurisdiction
other
than
the
one
which
has
compelled
the
testimony
be
bound
by
the
transactional
immunity
rule.
so
we
have
not
proposed
this
parade
of
horrors
that
the
district
attorney
refers
to
when
some
small
state
prosecution
willing
to
lay
the
witness
from
large
important
federal
prosecution.
this
is
not
what
we
are
saying
at
all.
it
is
our
position
that
the
jurisdiction
which
makes
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
compel
the
testimony
and
presumably
evaluates
so
far
as
the
down
jurisdiction
is
concerned
how
important
the
testimony
is
or
how
important
the
prosecution
against
that
witness
would
be.
that
jurisdiction
which
makes
that
definite
decision
to
grant
immunity
should
be
bound
by
that
decision.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
and
must
grant
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
that’s
correct.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
by
that
jurisdiction
but
the
jurisdiction
which
is
not
participated
in
this
decision
would
not
be
bound
to
that
extent
as
to
that
jurisdiction
of
the
murphy
rule
which
says
a
protection
use
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
use
and
fruits.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
would
be
the
proper
rule
to
apply.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
i
think
it's
very--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
it
is
our
position
that
a
--
well,
a
man
who
has
in
fact
been
forced
to
testify
can
never
be
placed
in
exact
same
spot
as
though
he
had
never
testified
and
this
is
a
fact
that
has
occurred
and
there's
no
way
of
pretending
that
it
never
happened.
but
to
get
him
as
close
as
possible
to
that
point
in
time
when
he
was
not
compelled
to
testify
which
meant
that
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
give
him
full
protection.
for
this
reason,
if
he’s
only
given
protection
against
the
use
of
his
testimony
or
his
fruits,
first
of
all,
this
involves
a
very,
very
difficult
factual
evidentiary
kind
of
a
hearing.
even
assuming
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
prosecuting
agency
as
it
was
mentioned,
it
would
be
in
murphy,
it
still
is
a
difficult
factual
question
because
it
almost
involves
the
--
an
exploration
into
the
thought
process
of
the
prosecuting
agency.
now,
we
are
assuming
that
this
is
the
same
agency
which
has
compelled
the
jurisdiction
so
we
can
further
assume
that
they
have
--
that
they
are
aware
of
the
compelled
testimony.
now,
you’d
have
to
go
into
their
minds
and
find
out
whether
that
testimony
set
off
any
trains
of
thought,
gave
them
any
ideas,
gave
them
any
hunches
that
they
acted
upon.
these
are
very,
very
difficult
things
to
trace
and
i
don’t
believe
that
you
can
ever
have
assurance
that
there
would
be
full
protection.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
this
is
true
except
for
the
fact
that
you're
dealing
with
two
different
jurisdictions
and
the
likelihood.
well,
for
example
in
this
case,
there
is
very
little
chance
that
the
district
attorney
of
kings
county
was
not
aware
of
the
petitioner’s
testimony.
but
if
there
were
federal
prosecution,
it
would
not
be
as
likely
that
the
federal
authorities
would
know
what
he
had
said.
and
so
you
wouldn’t
have
this
difficult
problem
of
determining
how
the
other
state
may
have
--
how
his
investigation
or
procedure
may
have
been
somehow
determined
by
what
he
heard
because
it's
not
so
clear
that
he
was
up
for
the
compelled
testimony.
certainly,
within
a
jurisdiction,
this
is
a
much,
much
greater
problem
and
we
can
see
that
because
of
certain
practical
considerations
involved
in
our
federal
system,
it
may
be
that
the
rule
would
have
to
be
different
between
the
two
jurisdictions
although
it's
not
easy
to
formulate
the
rationale.
apart
from
just
saying
that
without
some
kind
of
differing
standards,
the
problems
that
the
district
attorney
has
presented
might
in
fact
come
into
being.
we
do
live
in
a
federal
system
and
as
murphy
recognized,
we
have
to
make
accommodations
between
federal
and
state
interests
and
we
submit
that
this
is
the
best
way
of
doing
it
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution.
it's
interesting
that
in
murphy,
they
stated
that
the
witness
who
is
being
protected
from
the
use
of
his
testimony
was
being
placed
in
substantially
the
same
position,
substantially,
as
though
he
had
not
testified
which
is
something
different
from
what
counselman
said
which
is
that
he
must
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
though
he
had
not
testified.
i
think
this
is
a
recognition
that
this
isn't
really
completely
what
the
constitution
would
require
but
because
it's
not
the
compelling
jurisdiction
and
because
of
our
federal
system,
this
would
be
a
proper
rule
under
the
constitution.
if
i
could
just
make
one
more
comment.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
these
questions
do
not
appear
in
this
case.
and
again
to
stress
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
compelling
jurisdiction
being
the
very
same
one
that
has
embarked
upon
the
prosecution
and
so
under
the
transactional
immunity
test
as
we
have
as
we
believe
it
is
evident
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
constitution,
the
indictment
in
this
case
must
necessarily
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
question
of
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
a
witness
before
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
bribery
conviction,
which
is
presently
being
appealed,
was
obtained
in
violation
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
further
in
violation
of
his
right
to
counsel,
under
the
federal
constitution.
in
about
march
of
1964,
the
petitioner
with
another
person,
were
arrested
for
an
assault
for
which
crime
they
were
subsequently
convicted.
on
the
same
day
that
they
were
arraigned
for
this
assault
charge,
they
allegedly
offered
a
bribe
to
the
arresting
police
officer
to
induce
the
officer
to
dispose
of
the
weapons
in
the
case
and
to
change
his
testimony
to
reveal
the
names
of
other
witnesses
and
so
on.
this
bribe
offer
was
fully
reported
to
the
district
attorney
in
march
of
1964.
they
obtained
a
mini-phone,
tape
recording
of
conversation
between
the
petitioner
and
the
police
officer,
and
all
of
these
was
in
the
hands
of
the
district
attorney
in
march
of
1964.
in
march
of
1965,
one
year
later,
while
the
petitioner
was
serving
his
sentence,
under
this
assault
conviction,
for
which
he
had
pleaded
guilty,
he
was
called
before
grand
jury,
which
was
reportedly
investigating
the
assault
that
had
been
committed
by
the
petitioner
and
the
conspiracies
arising
therefrom.
his
co-defendant
in
the
assault
case
was
called
first,
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment,
was
granted
immunity
and
testified.
the
petitioner
never
had
a
chance
to
plead
the
fifth
but
was
immediately
offered
immunity
--
was
voted
immunity.
immediately
prior
to
his
actual
testimony,
he
requested
to
see
his
lawyer
and
he
was
assured
by
the
district
attorney
conducting
the
investigation
that
he
had
nothing
to
worry
about.
he
was
being
fully
protected,
he
didn’t
need
a
lawyer
at
all,
and
so
he
testified.
four
days
later,
the
district
attorney
had
the
police
officer
to
whom
the
bribe
was
offered
come
in
and
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
several
months
later,
the
petitioner
who
had
been
told
that
he
was
being
fully
protected
was
indicted
for
bribery.
the
bribery
conviction
is
the
case
that
is
presently
on
appeal.
and
during
the
course
of
the
petitioner’s
grand
jury
testimony,
which
is
--
i
stated
was
given
under
a
grant
of
immunity.
he
was
asked
to
testify
about
the
particular
facts
surrounding
the
assault
itself.
what
weapons
were
used,
where
the
assault
took
place,
they
were
interested
in
who
would
hired
him.
the
petitioner
could
only
give
a
name
and
a
vague
description.
as
i
said,
he
was
asked
about
the
weapons
that
were
used.
he
was
asked
where
the
assault
took
place
and
so
on.
there
was,
i
may
point
out,
no
eyewitness
to
this
assault,
so
the
only
direct
evidence
of
the
assault
itself
would
have
to
come
either
from
the
victim
of
the
assault
or
the
petitioner
and
his
co-defendant.
the
police
officer
was
also
asked
about
the
assault
and
was
particularly
asked
about
what
petitioner
had
told
him
about
the
facts
of
the
assault.
and
the
police
officer’s
version
of
what
the
petitioner
told
him
jived
very,
very
closely
with
what
the
petitioner
had
testified
to.
as
it
turns
out,
the
petitioner
had
described
all
of
these
events
to
the
police
officer
during
the
course
of
making
the
bribe
offer,
for
which
the
petitioner
was
indicted.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
first
that
the
grand
jury
actually
relied
or
probably
relied
upon
the
petitioner’s
testimony,
when
they
decided
to
indict
him
for
bribery.
it
is
secondly
our
position
that
the
petitioner
should
have
been
protected
from
indictment
for
bribery,
because
under
the
constitution,
as
you
can
see
he
had
been
compelled
to
testify
to
matters
relevant
to
the
bribery.
he
had
to
be
given
protection
for
such
a
prosecution
and
it
is
further
our
position
that
the
petitioner
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
consult
with
his
attorney
before
he
testified
and
as
a
result
the
indictment
that
was
obtained
must
be
dismissed.
we
submit
that
the
grand
jury,
in
fact,
actually
relied
upon
the
petitioner’s
testimony.
he
used
the
petitioner’s
testimony
as
a
basis
for
indicting
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner’s
testimony
supplied
the
grand
jury
with
a
motive
for
the
bribe
offer
to
which
the
officer
would
later
testify.
and
although,
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
motive
may
not
be
a
necessary
element
of
the
crime
of
bribery,
it’s
certainly
easier
to
get
a
conviction
and
we
submit
easier
to
get
an
indictment
if
the
prosecuting
agency
is
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
motive.
and
so,
the
petitioner’s
admission
that
he
had
committed
the
assault
and
that
he
committed
the
assault
with
the
weapons
that
the
police
officer
later
said
he
was
suppose
to
dispose
of
it
in
some
way.
but
we
think
was
crucial
in
this
case
and
may
very
--
there
was
a
strong
likelihood
that
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
indict
was
in
fact
based
upon
the
grand
jury’s
knowledge
that
there
was
a
strong
motive
for
bribery
in
this
case.
it
is
further
out
position
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner’s
testimony
jives
so
closely
with
the
police
officer’s
version
of
what
the
petitioner
had
told
him
made
the
police
officer
more
credible
to
the
grand
jury.
they
didn’t
have
to
believe
the
police
officer.
he
hadn’t
seen
the
assault
and
so
that
all
that
he
could
testify
to
really
was
what
the
petitioner
told
him.
and
it
wasn’t
necessary
that
they
believe
the
police
officer,
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner’s
testimony
supported
the
police
officer’s
testimony
in
so
many
respects,
they
also
have
led
to
the
grand
jury
decision
that
in
fact,
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
bribery
and
should
be
indicted
therefore.
in
addition,
there’s
always
a
possibility
that
the
grand
jury
saw
the
petitioner,
made
an
evaluation
of
his
character,
of
his
demeanor,
of
his
honesty,
of
his
forthrightness,
and
in
view
of
their
evaluation
of
his
character
determined
that
he
had
committed
the
bribery
and
therefore
should
be
indicted
for.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
no,
it's
our
position
that
a
person
who
has
been
forced
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
forced
to
give
up
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
should
not
be
indicted
by
that
same
grand
jury.
particularly,
not
in
the
case
like
this,
where
the
subject
matter
of
his
testimony
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment
are
so
close.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
i
--
this
certainly
is
a
problem
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
a
grand
jury
will
take
a
claim
of
privileges
being
some
sort
of
an
admission
of
guilt.
the
several
cases
which
we
relied
upon
which
established
that
--
which
stated
that
the
grand
jury
may
be
affected
by
the
considerations
i
have
mentioned,
point
this
out
as
well.
this
is
a
chance
that
a
man
must
take
if
he
wishes
to
assert
his
privilege.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
once
he
has
been
--
his
privilege
has
been
taken
away
from
him,
and
he
has
been
told
that
he
would
be
protected
and
the
grand
jury
should
be
entitled
to
rely
upon
these
factors.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
on
point
one,
i
would
not
be
here.
certainly,
however,
the
remainder
of
my
argument
would
be
equally
valid.
but
i
certainly
agree
if
it
a
different
grand
jury
than
the
problem
i
raised
in
the
first
point
of
my
brief
would
not
exist.
but
in
fact,
he
was
indicted
by
this
very
same
grand
jury.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
between
--
i’m
sorry,
between
what?
ms.
malvine
nathanson
in
the
indictment?
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
he
appeared
in
march
of
1965
and
he
was
indicted
in
july
of
1965,
as
a
formal
matter.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
your
honor,
there
is
no
way,
there
is
certainly
no
way
of
defense
counsel
to
be
aware
of
the
names
who
appeared
in
the
grand
jury.
there
is
however,
the
statutory
framework
in
new
york
would
require
that
there
at
least
be
seven
people
there
at
the
same
time.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
no,
no,
i
didn’t
make
myself
clear.
the
grand
jury
system
provides
that
there
are
23
people,
16
to
23
people
on
the
grand
jury.
but
16
are
necessary
for
a
quorum.
so,
there
must
be
16
of
23
present
on
each
occasion.
in
addition,
there
can
be
no
indictment,
except
by
the
concurrence
of
12
of
those
minimum
16.
and
if
we
work
out
the
numbers,
at
least
seven
people
must
be
identical
in
any
two
sittings
of
the
grand
jury.
there
would
be
no
way
of
having
it
be
a
completely
different
group
of
people.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
seven
is
a
majority
of
12,
which
is
what
we
required
to
indict.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
23
maximum,
16
for
a
quorum
and
12
to
indict.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
we
just
don’t
know
what
happened
in
this
occasion.
this
information
is
not
available,
but
there
certainly
were
many
people,
who
heard
both
the
testimony.
that
testimony
was
four
days
apart
over
a
weekend,
the
police
officer
and
the
petitioner.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
no,
your
honor,
but
where
the
witness’
testimony
has
some
relevance,
so
that
their
evaluation
of
this
witness
would
directly
bear
upon
the
subsequent
indictment,
then
they
can't.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
your
honor,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
that
one
of
the
factors,
which
not
only
in
this
case
was
the
defendant
in
fact,
the
petitioner
in
fact
testify
to
the
same
matter
that
the
patrol
man
later
testified
too,
and
that
form
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment.
but
in
addition,
the
grand
jury
may
have
evaluated
his
demeanor
and
so
on.
this
is
not
–
i
am
not
saying
this
would
be
a
sufficient
ground
for
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
but
i
believe
it
is
another
factor
in
the
context
to
this
case,
which
should
be
considered.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
the
result
would
be
the
same.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
about
seven
months
after
their
decision
in
this
case,
overruled
this
case
and
so
far
it
has
set
down
certain
general
legal
principles.
however,
they
stated
that
they
had
taken
another
look
at
the
record.
what
they
said
was
this
is
not
to
say
we
have
decided
piccirillo
incorrectly,
because
in
fact,
in
piccirillo,
the
legal
testimonies
that
we’re
setting
down
now
would
not
absolve
them
of
this
conviction.
there
is
certainly
no
question
that
this
court
of
appeals
has
in
fact
considered
piccirillo
in
light
of
its
subsequent
decision
in
people
again
--
the
matter
of
menna,
which
i
assume
that
you
are
alluding
to,
and
has
reaffirmed
its
decision
in
piccirillo
as
to
the
result.
they
have
again
found
that
mr.
piccirillo’s
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
were
not
violated.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
subsequent
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
purports
to
adopt
what
we
say,
is
a
federal
constitutional
rule.
really,
there's
no
more
than
pay
lip
service
to
that
federal
constitutional
rule,
i
think
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
way
they
apply
that
rule
in
this
case.
the
spirit
with
which
they
apply,
the
federal
constitutional
rule
does
not
give
its
full
effect,
to
the
effect
that
we
believe
it
should
have
with
regard
to
the
second
point
of
my
brief.
this
is
of
the
transactional
immunity
rule
that
we
assert
is
required
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
is
that
a
witness
who
is
compelled
to
give
up
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
must
be
guaranteed
that
he
will
be
immune
from
prosecution
by
the
compelling
jurisdiction,
as
to
any
transaction
relevant
to
his
testimony.
this
is
commonly
known
as
the
transactional
immunity
rule.
it
is
our
position
that
this
the
rule
that
was
first
enunciated
in
the
first
occasion
in
this
court
to
deal
with
the
question
of
immunity
and
the
abrogation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
counselman
v.
hitchcock.
it
has
been
constantly
reiterated,
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
and
we
believe
is
a
very
sound
rule.
the
rationale
for
the
rule,
i
think
is
quite
simple.
the
fifth
amendment
states
very
explicitly,
“no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself.”
there's
no
ifs,
and,
buts,
no
qualifications.
only
if
the
incriminatory
aspect
of
his
testimony
can
be
removed,
if
in
fact
as
he
testifies,
he
is
not
subject
to
any
criminal
prosecution
that
could
be
based
on
his
testimony.
only
then
can
you
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
no
longer
applies
and
he
may
be
forced
to
testify.
and
we
submit
that
this
can
only
done
by
granting
him
immunity
as
to
any
crime,
which
could
be
related
to
his
testimony
and
which
could
be
proved
through
his
testimony
worthily
leads.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
exclusionary
rule
with
the
district
attorney
contends
this
as
a
sufficient
rule,
under
the
constitution,
is
in
fact
a
sufficient
rule.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
yes.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
oh!
no,
no,
immunity
would
only
protect
somebody
up
to
the
point
of
its
testimony.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
yes,
i
do.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
your
question
and
i
thought
you
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
subsequent
to
the
bribe,
and
not
subsequent
to
his
testimony.
that’s
what
i
misunderstood,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
certainly
not
subsequent
to
his
testimony,
because
his
immunity
at
the
time
of
his
testimony
would
only
cover
what
had
happened
before.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
on
the
basis
of
your
question
and
without
having
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
analyze
the
facts,
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
covered
by
the
transaction
immunity.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well
actually,
in
new
york,
i
believe
that
kidnapping
is
not
covered
by
immunity,
and
nobody
would
have
power
to
grant
him
immunity
in
an
investigation
of
that
sort.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
--
without
a
chance
to
actually
analyze
the
testimony,
because
i
think
it
all
depends
on
exactly
what
he
testified
to
and
is
it
substantially
related
to
the
crime
for
which
he
is
being
prosecuted.
and
to
be
perfectly
honest,
i
would
have
to
sit
down,
read
his
testimony,
take
a
look
at
the
facts
of
the
crime
and
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
substantial
relation
and
this
is
hypothetical,
because
i
haven’t
previously
considered.
but
this
would
be
the
test,
and
if
after
analysis
it
would
be
determined
that
the
testimony
that
he
gave
was
substantially
related
to
the
beating
up
of
the
children.
then,
it
certainly
would
be
covered.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
it’s
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
that’s
right.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
but
the
test
is
not
--
is
not
whether
there
might
be
a
similar
motivation
between
the
two
crimes
or
anything
like
that.
the
test
is
his
testimony
itself,
what
he
said
in
the
grand
jury
are
the
words
that
he
uttered
substantially
related
to
the
subsequent
crime.
and
in
fact,
they
are
substantially
related.
then
under
this
court’s
holding
in
heike
he
would
be
covered,
under
a
transaction
immunity
standard.
i
would
hesitate
at
this
moment
to
make
that
evaluation
of
a
hypothetical
that
i,
you
know,
had
not
had
chance
to
evaluate.
it
is
our
position
certainly
in
this
case
that
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
and
the
bribery
prosecution
that
was
subsequently
commenced.
for
the
same
reasons
that
we
feel
that
the
testimony
could
in
fact
have
been
relied
upon
by
the
grand
jury
in
indicting,
that
kind
of
create
the
same
kind
of
relevancy.
the
testimony
established
the
motive
for
the
bribe
offer.
it
was
in
fact
about
the
same
tire
irons
that
had
been
used
during
the
assault
and
that
were
the
subject
matter
of
a
bribe
offer.
so,
we
feel
there's
no
question,
but
if
there
was
a
substantial
relationship
and
that
under
the
transaction
immunity
test,
which
we
contend
as
a
federal
constitutional
test
and
as
it
has
been
explained
by
this
court
in
heike
and
applied
in
other
cases,
the
bribery
indictment
must
be
found
to
have
been
covered
by
the
transaction
immunity
to
which
this
petitioner
was
entitled.
it
is
finally
our
contention
that
the
petitioner’s
right
to
counsel
was
very
seriously
abrogated
in
this
case.
as
i
mentioned
before,
prior
to
his
giving
any
testimony,
he
asked
if
he
could
speak
to
his
lawyer.
and
he
was
told
by
the
--
or
whether
he
stated
that
he
would
like
to
speak
to
his
lawyer
first.
and
he
was
by
told
by
the
district
attorney,
who
is
in-charge
of
the
case,
that
this
would
not
be
necessary.
in
effect,
what
mr.
piccirillo
told
him
after
he
asked
for
his
lawyer,
he
said,
“under
these
circumstances
you
are
not
a
defendant,
you
are
a
witness,”
this
is
at
page
7
of
my
brief,
“you
have
been
given
immunity
that
means
you
cannot
be
prosecuted.
your
rights
are
fully
protected
and
there’s
no
reason
for
your
conferring
with
your
attorney.”
now,
of
course
they
pointed
that
the
man
was
indicted
by
the
same
grand
jury
several
months
later.
and
i
think
there
is
at
least
a
very
serious
question
whether
some
of
his
rights
were
being
affected
during
his
grand
jury
proceeding.
and
perhaps
the
advice
of
counsel
might
have
been
helpful
to
him.
at
the
very
least,
counsel
might
have
clarified
for
him
what
this
immunity.
they
were
talking
about
was
about
as
the
question
mr.
blackmun
--
mr.
justice
blackmun
points
out
there
is
somewhat
of
a
problem,
where
has
been
in
new
york
state
as
to
what
the
immunity
standard
should
be
to
compare
this
case
with
the
subsequently
decided
case
of
matter
of
menna.
the
advice
given
by
the
district
attorney
himself,
his
definition
of
what
the
immunity
would
be,
kind
of
veers
between
a
testimonial
standard
and
a
transactional
immunity
standard.
we
also
submit
that
a
counsel
could
have
been
important
perhaps
even
in
negotiating,
an
additional
amount
of
immunity
for
his
client,
which
is
certainly
a
perfectly
appropriate
role
of
counsel,
if
counsel
can
accomplish
this
sort
of
thing.
counsel
could
at
least
have
made
clear
to
petitioner,
what
was
being
covered
and
what
was
not
being
covered.
now,
all
the
parties
in
this
proceeding
knew
about
the
bribery.
the
da
had
had
information
about
this
bribery,
at
least
a
year
before,
when
it
has
first
occurred.
he
had
mini-phone,
he
had
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
the
statements
of
the
police
officer.
the
lawyer
for
the
petitioner
knew
about
the
bribe
offer
and
obviously
petitioner
knew
about
the
bribe
offer.
certainly,
the
parties
involved
could
have
clarified
whether
or
not
the
district
attorney
thought
that
this
bribe
offer
was
being
covered
by
this
offer
of
immunity.
and,
if
in
fact,
it
was
not
being
covered,
petitioner
may
just
not
want
to
have
given
up
his
privilege,
he
may
have
rather
subject
himself
to
a
contempt
for
execution,
which
i
submit
it's
just
perfect
right
to
do.
even
with
the
grant
of
immunity
there
is
no
reason
why
a
man
can't
elect
to
go
to
jail
for
contempt,
rather
than
perhaps
get
into
worst
trouble
by
being
indicted
for
substantive
crime.
and
so,
we
think
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
counsel
could
have
done
during
these
proceedings
to
advise
the
petitioner,
to
assist
him,
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
district
attorney
and
to
have
been
able
the
petitioner
to
make
a
considered
reason,
well-informed
decision
as
to
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
do
when
called
before
the
grand
jury.
and
the
district
attorney’s
cavalier
dismissal
of
his
request
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
with
the
assurance
that
he
had
nothing
to
worry
about
and
he
was
being
fully
protected.
this
points
up
the
need
that
this
petitioner
had
for
a
lawyer
to
advise
him.
and
so,
it's
our
position
that
for
these
three
reasons,
the
fact
that
his
testimony,
his
compelled
testimony,
in
fact,
was
used
in
obtaining
the
indictment.
the
fact
that
he
should
have
been
given
an
immunity
that
would
cover
the
bribery
prosecution
under
the
transaction
immunity
standard,
the
fact
that
he
was
deprived
his
right
to
counsel,
all
require
that
the
conviction
of
this
case
be
reversed.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
on
this
question
of
the
effect
of
the
rule
that
we
state
as
constitutional
required
upon
criminal
prosecutions
throughout
this
entire
country,
first,
i
believe
the
district
attorney
has
misinterpreted
what
we
state
as
constitutionally
required.
the
counselman
rule
as
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief,
refers
to
the
requirement
that
the
compelling
jurisdiction
--
compelling
jurisdiction
grant
transactional
immunity
to
the
witness.
the
murphy
situation
of
course
was
a
case
where
the
compelling
jurisdiction
and
the
using
jurisdiction,
or
potentially
using
jurisdiction,
were
two
different
places.
it
is
not
the
situation
on
this
case
but
that
distinction
is
very
important.
we
have
not
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well,
we
have
not
proposed
that
a
jurisdiction
other
than
the
one
which
has
compelled
the
testimony
be
bound
by
the
transactional
immunity
rule.
so
we
have
not
proposed
this
parade
of
horrors
that
the
district
attorney
refers
to
when
some
small
state
prosecution
willing
to
lay
the
witness
from
large
important
federal
prosecution.
this
is
not
what
we
are
saying
at
all.
it
is
our
position
that
the
jurisdiction
which
makes
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
compel
the
testimony
and
presumably
evaluates
so
far
as
the
down
jurisdiction
is
concerned
how
important
the
testimony
is
or
how
important
the
prosecution
against
that
witness
would
be.
that
jurisdiction
which
makes
that
definite
decision
to
grant
immunity
should
be
bound
by
that
decision.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
and
must
grant
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
that’s
correct.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
by
that
jurisdiction
but
the
jurisdiction
which
is
not
participated
in
this
decision
would
not
be
bound
to
that
extent
as
to
that
jurisdiction
of
the
murphy
rule
which
says
a
protection
use
--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
use
and
fruits.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
would
be
the
proper
rule
to
apply.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
i
think
it's
very--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
it
is
our
position
that
a
--
well,
a
man
who
has
in
fact
been
forced
to
testify
can
never
be
placed
in
exact
same
spot
as
though
he
had
never
testified
and
this
is
a
fact
that
has
occurred
and
there's
no
way
of
pretending
that
it
never
happened.
but
to
get
him
as
close
as
possible
to
that
point
in
time
when
he
was
not
compelled
to
testify
which
meant
that
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
give
him
full
protection.
for
this
reason,
if
he’s
only
given
protection
against
the
use
of
his
testimony
or
his
fruits,
first
of
all,
this
involves
a
very,
very
difficult
factual
evidentiary
kind
of
a
hearing.
even
assuming
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
prosecuting
agency
as
it
was
mentioned,
it
would
be
in
murphy,
it
still
is
a
difficult
factual
question
because
it
almost
involves
the
--
an
exploration
into
the
thought
process
of
the
prosecuting
agency.
now,
we
are
assuming
that
this
is
the
same
agency
which
has
compelled
the
jurisdiction
so
we
can
further
assume
that
they
have
--
that
they
are
aware
of
the
compelled
testimony.
now,
you’d
have
to
go
into
their
minds
and
find
out
whether
that
testimony
set
off
any
trains
of
thought,
gave
them
any
ideas,
gave
them
any
hunches
that
they
acted
upon.
these
are
very,
very
difficult
things
to
trace
and
i
don’t
believe
that
you
can
ever
have
assurance
that
there
would
be
full
protection.
ms.
malvine
nathanson
well--
ms.
malvine
nathanson
this
is
true
except
for
the
fact
that
you're
dealing
with
two
different
jurisdictions
and
the
likelihood.
well,
for
example
in
this
case,
there
is
very
little
chance
that
the
district
attorney
of
kings
county
was
not
aware
of
the
petitioner’s
testimony.
but
if
there
were
federal
prosecution,
it
would
not
be
as
likely
that
the
federal
authorities
would
know
what
he
had
said.
and
so
you
wouldn’t
have
this
difficult
problem
of
determining
how
the
other
state
may
have
--
how
his
investigation
or
procedure
may
have
been
somehow
determined
by
what
he
heard
because
it's
not
so
clear
that
he
was
up
for
the
compelled
testimony.
certainly,
within
a
jurisdiction,
this
is
a
much,
much
greater
problem
and
we
can
see
that
because
of
certain
practical
considerations
involved
in
our
federal
system,
it
may
be
that
the
rule
would
have
to
be
different
between
the
two
jurisdictions
although
it's
not
easy
to
formulate
the
rationale.
apart
from
just
saying
that
without
some
kind
of
differing
standards,
the
problems
that
the
district
attorney
has
presented
might
in
fact
come
into
being.
we
do
live
in
a
federal
system
and
as
murphy
recognized,
we
have
to
make
accommodations
between
federal
and
state
interests
and
we
submit
that
this
is
the
best
way
of
doing
it
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution.
it's
interesting
that
in
murphy,
they
stated
that
the
witness
who
is
being
protected
from
the
use
of
his
testimony
was
being
placed
in
substantially
the
same
position,
substantially,
as
though
he
had
not
testified
which
is
something
different
from
what
counselman
said
which
is
that
he
must
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
though
he
had
not
testified.
i
think
this
is
a
recognition
that
this
isn't
really
completely
what
the
constitution
would
require
but
because
it's
not
the
compelling
jurisdiction
and
because
of
our
federal
system,
this
would
be
a
proper
rule
under
the
constitution.
if
i
could
just
make
one
more
comment.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
these
questions
do
not
appear
in
this
case.
and
again
to
stress
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
compelling
jurisdiction
being
the
very
same
one
that
has
embarked
upon
the
prosecution
and
so
under
the
transactional
immunity
test
as
we
have
as
we
believe
it
is
evident
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
constitution,
the
indictment
in
this
case
must
necessarily
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
