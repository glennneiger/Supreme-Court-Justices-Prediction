mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
if
the
court
please,
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
just
mention
two
things
before
i
actually
get
into
the
discussion
of
the
law.
first,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question,
i
think
it's
safe
to
assume
that
the
grand
jury
that
voted
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
the
same
jury
that
did
here,
the
defendant
testified.
i
believe
this
was
an
extended
grand
jury,
normally
in
kings
county
the
jury
sits
to
periods
of
30
or
60
days.
but
i
believe
this
jury
sat
for
an
extended
period,
something
like
a
year
or
so.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
i
believe
that
it
was
the
jury
with
the
same
people
that
heard
him
testified.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
yes,
that’s
true.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
your
honor,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
looking
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
hindsight,
tactically
speaking,
that
would
have
been
a
better
procedure,
however
the
question
here
is
whether
the
procedure
violated
the
constitutional
requirements.
and
with
your
honor’s
permission
i
would
prefer
to
wait
and
discuss
that
point
after
the
first
one.
and
second,
i
think
it's
important
to
place
the
facts
of
what
happened
here
in
their
proper
perspective.
and
what
i'm
going
to
discuss
now
is
in
the
record,
it
was
mentioned
on
sentence
and
so
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
these
are
not
things
that
have
not
been
in
this
case.
this
case
led
to
a
scandal
and
basically
in
new
york
county,
involving
(inaudible),
involving
the
new
york
housing
authority.
now,
apparently
the
victim
in
this
case,
a
person
by
the
name
of
jack
graham
was
employed
by
the
housing
authority.
and
apparently,
there
was
something
about
him
revealing
some
of
the
things
that
had
been
going
on
and
he
had
been
apparently
talking
to
police
or
the
district
attorney.
and
the
petitioner
here
and
co-defendant,
who
was
no
longer
alive,
were
hired
to
beat
this
fellow
up.
and
they
met
him
one
night
in
the
parking
lot
of
his
home,
they
assaulted
him,
they
hit
him
with
tire
irons.
this
occurred
in
march
of
1964.
now,
the
very
next
day,
when
he
was
being
arraigned
in
the
criminal
court,
the
bribe
offer
was
made
to
the
patrolman.
the
patrolman
advised
us
about
it,
we
advised
him
to
meet
the
petitioner
at
a
different
time.
he
did
and
we
had
mini-phone
equipment.
eventually,
the
petitioner
pleaded
guilty,
he
was
convicted
of
assault
and
he
was
sentenced
to
the
term
of
imprisonment.
now,
approximately
a
year
later,
while
he
was
serving
their
sentence,
he
was
called
to
the
grand
jury.
he
had
not
been
arrested
or
in
any
way,
there
had
been
no
proceedings
instituted
regarding
the
bribery
conviction.
now,
when
the
grand
jury
called
him
in,
they
weren’t
interested
in
prosecuting
this
man
for
bribery
at
all.
they
were
interested
in
finding
out,
who
paid
him
to
commit
the
assault
and
to
get
into
the
background
of
this
whole
thing.
they
wanted
names,
they
wanted
to
know
when
the
meeting
took
place
and
so
forth
and
this
is
how
this
case
arose.
and
so
in
march
1965,
the
witness
was
called
back
and
was
given
immunity.
now,
new
york
has
a
use
plus
transactional
immunity
statute.
the
statutes
are
reprinted
in
both
petitioner’s
and
respondent’s
briefs.
and
that
statute
protects
a
witness
from
the
use
of
his
testimony,
plus
fruits
or
leads
and
the
statute
also
gives
him
transactional
immunity,
regarding
any
manner
or
thing,
concerning
which
he
testifies.
now,
that’s
clear.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
decided
if
analyzing
counselman
versus
hitchcock,
the
murphy
case,
and
all
of
the
relevant
decisions.
that
the
only
thing
that
constitution
required
was,
that
a
witness
be
given
use
plus-fruits
immunity
and
that
the
transactional
portion
of
the
new
york
statute
was
not
mandated
by
the
federal
constitution.
then
the
court
concluded
that
the
new
york
statute
was
passed,
because
of
the
dicta
in
counselman
and
that
it
really
was
the
intention
of
the
legislature
to
give
the
witness
no
more
than
the
constitution
would
require
if
to
give
any
witness.
and
so,
the
court
held
that
the
new
york
statute
only
prevented
the
use
of
his
testimony
plus-fruits
or
leads.
then
seven
months
later,
the
court
overruled
this
case,
but
only
to
the
extent
of
its
interpretation
of
the
second
portion
of
the
new
york
statute.
in
other
words,
it
said,
“we
were
right.
we
still
believe
that
the
constitution
only
requires
a
use
plus-fruits
immunity.”
however,
the
new
york
statute
is
clear
and
there
really
has
never
been
any
doubt.
and
we
must
interpret
the
statute
according
to
its
plain
language.
and
so
we
hold
that
the
new
york
statute
does
give
transactional
immunity,
although
it's
not
required
by
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
no,
i
don’t
believe
there
was
any
change,
it's
very
interesting,
i
believe
judge
keating
who
wrote
the
majority
of
opinion
had
left
the
court
though.
when
we
argued
this
case
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
we
really
didn’t
even
argue
this
point.
and
so,
we
were
quite
surprise
when
the
court
decided
that
the
new
york
statue,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
was
not
an
immunity
statute.
apparently,
they
just
felt
that
they
had
misinterpreted
the
statute.
i
think
it's
clear
from
reading
gold
versus
menna
and
nothing
more.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
that’s
right,
because
we
all
assumed
that
new
york
statute
granted
transaction
immunity,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
now,
i
think
that’s
very
important,
and
it's
important
for
this
reason,
if
transaction
immunity
or
first
let
me
say
this,
then
he
was
brought
into
the
grand
jury
in
1965
and
questioned
about
the
events
leading
up
to
the
assault
and
there’s
a
lot
of
testimony.
he
was
asked
many,
many
questions,
but
as
a
matter
of
introduction,
of
course,
the
testimony
started
of
by
the
prosecutor
saying
to
him,
“now,
you’ve
been
indicted
--
you’ve
been
convicted
of
assault
and
you’re
serving
a
sentence
for
it
and
isn’t
it
true
that
has
all
occurred
on
such,
and
such
a
date
where
you
hit
this
man
with
a
tire
iron.”
and
the
word
“tire
iron”
was
mentioned.
now,
it
was
argued
that
by
use
of
tire
iron,
that
the
defendant
got
immunity
from
prosecution
for
the
bribery,
because
when
he
made
the
bribe
offer
to
the
officer,
he
said,
he
offered
him
money,
in
exchange
for
changing
his
testimony
and
losing
the
tire
iron.
and
so,
the
argument
was
made
that
because
the
phrase
or
the
two-words
“tire
iron”
was
used
in
the
grand
jury,
that
this
meant
that
the
defendant
testified
to
a
thing
or
matter
as
set
forth
in
the
new
york
statute.
now,
if
transactional
immunity
is
required
by
--
incidentally,
the
court
below,
all
the
way
down
the
line
held,
as
matter
of
fact
that
this
was
not
a
thing
testified
to
and
that
the
testimony
he
gave
had
no
relation,
as
matter
of
fact,
to
the
testimony
which
supported
the
indictment.
now,
this
is
important
because
if
transaction
immunity
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution,
then
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
or
wasn’t
a
thing
as
specified
in
the
new
york
state
statute
is
a
matter
of
federal
importance
and
it
is
to
be
decided
by
uniform
standard.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
only
thing
that
the
constitution
requires
is
a
use
plus
fruits
immunity,
then
when
new
york
decided
whether
this
crime
as
bribery
was
one
of
the
things
testified
too
in
the
grand
jury
becomes
strictly
a
matter
of
a
state
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
and
there
was
no
federal
constitutional
question
involved.
and
so
it
is
necessary
to
decide
whether
transactional
immunity
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution.
now,
the
petitioner
relies
a
great
deal
on
the
case
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock.
now,
it's
our
position
that
counselman
is
not
the
law
anymore
that
it
has
been
overruled
or
that
if
it
hasn’t,
it
should
be.
and
that
the
consequences
of
our
holding
in
counselman
are
much
greater
and
dangerous
today
than
they
we're
in
the
days
when
it
was
decided.
we
also
take
the
position
at
the
murphy
versus
the
waterfront
commission
case
and
malloy
versus
hogan
have
closed
this
question.
and
that
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
constitution
only
requires
a
witness
to
be
put
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
pleaded
his
privilege
or
as
if
he
had
never
testified.
in
other
words,
he
is
to
get
only
that
protection
that
the
constitution
gives
him.
and
to
protect
the
use
by
any
government
of
the
testimony
he
gives
and
the
leads
obtained
from
or
the
fruits
of
that
testimony
would
do
that.
to
give
him
transactional
protection
is
to
give
him
a
benefit
not
required
by
the
constitution
and
it's
a
benefit
which
each
and
every
state
should
have
the
right
to
decide
for
themselves.
that
is
whether
they
want
to
give
it
to
them
or
not.
now,
this
is
really
the
key
issue
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
there
really
is
not
much
doubt
about
the
law
in
this
area.
now,
this
court
in
murphy
said
that
we
hold
the
constitutional
rule
to
be
that
a
state
witness
may
not
be
compelled
to
give
testimony
which
may
be
incriminating
on
the
federal
law
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
we
conclude
moreover,
that
in
order
to
implement
this
constitutional
rule
and
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
in
investigating
and
prosecuting
crime,
the
federal
government
must
be
prohibited
for
making
any
such
use
of
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits.
this
exclusionary
rule
while
permitting
the
states
to
secure
information
necessary
for
effective
law
enforcement
leaves
the
witness
and
the
federal
government
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
if
the
witness
had
claimed
this
privilege
in
the
absence
of
a
state
granted
immunity.
and
in
footnote
18,
in
that
decision
made
it
clear
as
far
as
the
rationale
was
concerned
that
this
court
was
only
saying
that
use
plus
fruits
was
required.
and
the
footnote
indicates
that
once
a
defendant
has
been
granted
immunity
and
compelled
to
testify
in
a
state
proceeding,
and
then
he
was
later
indicted
in
the
federal
jurisdiction
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
federal
government
to
show
that
the
source
of
the
evidence
used
against
in
was
untainted
and
did
not
in
any
way
stem
from
the
evidence
he
gave
before
state
grand
jury
which
indicated
that
each
government
would
be
free
to
prosecute
or
obtain
indictments
against
the
witness
provided
that
were
totally
completely
independent.
and
this,
i
submit
would
be
the
same
situation
that
a
witness
would
find
himself
in
if
he
never
were
a
witness,
if
he
were
never
compelled
to
testify.
you're
sort
of
saying
to
a
witness
tell
us
things;
give
us
information
which
we
intend
to
use
against
other
people
sort
of
off
the
record.
we're
not
going
to
use
it
against
you,
use
it
in
any
way
to
obtain
evidence
against
you.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
something
comes
up
clearly
from
an
independent
source,
we
do
not
want
to
be
prohibited
from
doing
what
we
normally
could
do.
now,
the
statement
in
counselman
which
caused
all
the
problem
was
a
dicta
in
that
decision.
now,
that
case
declared
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional
because
in
that
case
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
statute
only
gave
use
immunity
and
did
not
protect
mr.
counselman
from
the
federal
government’s
using
the
fruits
of
his
testimony
or
obtaining
leads
from
his
testimony.
and
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
statement
which
has
been
discussed
very
often
came
later
on
in
the
opinion
and
was
not
necessary
to
its
decision.
now,
this
was
pointed
out
in
the
murphy
case,
in
this
case,
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
new
jersey’s
opinion
in
the
zicarelli
case
which
i
submit
as
highly
persuasive.
also,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
effect
of
the
decision
in
counselman
was
not
very
great
because
you
had
the
two
sovereignties
doctrine.
and
it
really
made
no
difference
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
because
the
fifth
amendment
could
not
be
pleaded
in
the
state
prosecution
and
vice
versa
--
the
opposite
was
true.
however,
since
this
court’s
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan
applying
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
states
has
come
down
a
holding
such
as
petitioner
suggests
counselman
requires
would
have
disastrous
effects
on
law
enforcement
throughout
the
united
states.
and
i
suggest
that
if
the
basis
for
counselman
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
was
decided
no
longer
exist,
then
counselman
should
be
reevaluated.
now,
many
courts
have
considered
this
problem
and
have
taken
the
position
and
this
court
has
overruled
counselman
even
though
it
didn’t
specifically
say
so
in
the
murphy
decision.
for
instance,
in
new
jersey,
in
the
zicarelli
case,
the
supreme
court
said
we,
and
incidentally,
new
jersey
enacted
a
statute
which
only
gave
use
plus
fruits
immunity,
this
statute
was
enacted
after
murphy
was
decided.
and
so
the
legislature
took
the
position
that
this
court
had
overruled
counselman
and
the
state
was
now
free
to
take
away
the
transactional
portion
of
the
protection
that
had
previously
afforded
witnesses.
and
so
it
passed
the
new
statute.
and
the
statute
was
tested
and
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
i
understand
the
case
is
here
on
a
sort
of
application
at
this
time.
and
the
court
said,
“we
heretofore
deemed
the
constitution
to
require
immunity
against
use
of
testimony
rather
than
immunity
from
prosecution.”
and
recently
all
legislatures
in
adopting
the
model
state
immunity
act
substituted
an
immunity
from
use
for
an
immunity
from
prosecution
which
i've
just
referred
to.
there
is
a
difference
in
that
murphy
dealt
with
a
federal
state
setting,
whereas
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
claim
that
our
statute
does
not
protect
the
witness
from
prosecution
under
state
law.
but
the
question
involved
is
the
same.
in
other
words,
what
immunity
of
the
fifth
amendment
requires
in
exchange
for
a
compulsion
to
answer.
the
values
involved
are
the
same.
we
see
no
sensible
basis
for
different
answer.
gardner
versus
broderick
treated
the
issue
as
one
and
the
same
siding
both
counselman
and
murphy.
murphy
held
and
gardner
repeated
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
protection
only
from
the
use
of
the
compelled
testimony
and
the
leads
it
furnishes
and
that
protection
of
our
statute
expressly
provides.
so
we
have
new
jersey
taking
that
field.
you
have
new
york
of
course
taking
that
view
in
this
case
and
in
the
many
cases.
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
judge
friendly
writing
for
the
majority
in
the
uniformed
sanitation
case.
it
took
the
same
view
and
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
in
two
cases
falls
at
the
(inaudible).
also,
california
in
interpreting
murphy
agreed
that
complete
immunity
such
as
what's
discussed
in
counselman
was
not
required
by
the
constitution
and
that
answers
could
be
compelled
as
long
there
was
immunity
from
federal
and
state
use
of
the
testimony
and
its
fruits.
i
also
point
out
that
maine
has
taken
the
same
view
and
kansas
in
dicta
has
also
agreed.
now,
the
appellants
cites
--
the
petitioners
cites
statutes
in
a
very
impressive
compilation
at
the
end
of
our
brief
four
or
in
the
appendix
of
all
of
the
50
states
in
which
it
is
clear
that
most
of
the
states
have
adopted
transactional
immunity
statutes.
and
apparently,
this
is
done
to
argue
that
if
the
states
felt
it
was
necessary
to
give
that
type
of
protection,
then
it
would’ve
be
persuasive.
and
this
court
order
be
persuaded
that
that
it
too
should
take
the
same
position.
i
would
like
to
point
out
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief
that
prior
to
counselman,
the
situation
was
just
the
opposite.
most
every
state
had
only
a
use
plus
fruits
statue.
but
because
of
the
dicta
in
the
counselman,
it
was
thought
that
transactional
immunity
was
now
required
as
a
federal
proposition
and
all
of
the
states
amended
their
statues.
and
so
since
the
state
statutes
were
only
changed
because
of
counselman,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
argue
that
these
statutes
are
themselves
persuasive
is
truly
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
also,
the
practical
effects
of
the
contrary
rule
or
as
the
--
or
of
a
rule
as
petitioner
argues
is
quite,
quite
important.
now,
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
murphy
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
if
this
court
adopts
a
transactional
rule,
it
will
in
effect
be
abrogating
the
immunity
statutes
in
every
single
state
because
a
state
cannot
give
federal
transaction
immunities
beyond
it's
power
but
since
because
of
malloy,
a
witness
can
now
plead
his
federal
privilege
in
a
state
proceeding
he
can
successfully
forward
an
attempt
of
any
state
to
give
him
immunity
and
secure
his
answers.
and
the
court
--
and
mr.
justice
white
said,
“the
invalid
--
that
this
would
invalidate
the
immunity
statutes
of
the
50
states
since
the
states
are
without
authority
to
confer
immunity
from
federal
prosecutions
and
would
thereby
cut
deeply
and
significantly
into
traditional
and
important
areas
of
state
authority
and
responsibility
in
our
federal
system.”
of
course
the
converse
should
be
looked
at
also.
if
it
could
be
said,
and
i
don’t
urge
it
that
a
state
did
have
the
power
to
grant
federal
transactional
immunity
in
a
state
proceeding,
and
that
if
the
state
in
granting
immunity
--
transactional
immunity
bound
the
federal
government,
then
the
effect
is
even
worse
because
if
that
were
true,
a
state
of
course
without
consultation
with
the
federal
government
and
without
the
government’s
knowledge
could
sterilize
the
federal
government
from
ever
proceeding
against
an
individual.
and
the
example
of
course
comes
to
mind
at
the
situation
where
the
government
may
have
a
case
prepared
against
a
particular
individual,
the
case
may
be
either
in
the
grand
jury
or
be
ready
to
go
to
a
grand
jury
when
all
of
a
sudden
it's
discovered
that
this
witness
in
a
state
prosecution
which
may
not
have
been
very
important
admitted
in
ans
--
responsive
answers
to
relevant
questions
that
he
had
committed
various
federal
crimes
which
were
then
under
investigation
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
so
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
witness
would’ve
--
would
gain
a
federal
immunity
and
would
prevent
the
federal
government
from
taking
any
sort
of
action.
now,
the
other
argument
is
made
that
we
used
the
testimony
of
this
witness
against
him
on
the
bribery
case
and
that
the
grand
jury
heard
him
testify
and
that
the
--
he
furnished
the
background
and
the
motive
for
their
action.
now,
the
record
i
think
dispels
that
argument.
first,
it
is
conceded
that
motive
on
the
new
york
law
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
but
the
court
of
appeals
decided
as
did
the
original
supreme
court
in
new
york
that
the
testimony
of
patrolman
sewell
was
complete
in
and
off
itself
that
any
testimony
given
by
this
witness
was
insubstantial
and
played
no
part
in
the
subsequent
indictment.
now,
of
course
the
only
thing
that
this
witness
said
was
that
he
had
used
the
tire
iron.
but
that
was
repeated
by
sewell
in
the
grand
jury
who
testified
that
when
the
bribe
offer
was
made
to
him,
the
witness
admitted
the
assault
admitted
using
a
tire
iron
and
admitted
many
things
and
this
is
in
the
appendix.
so,
that
the
testimony
of
this
witness
was
totally
unnecessary
to
support
the
indictment
which
was
obtained.
i
think
that
merely
using
the
same
grand
jury
does
not
in
and
of
itself
violate
anyone’s
rights.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
it
is
common
practice
for
instance
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
present
a
case
against
a
man
have
all
the
evidence
completed
and
then
subpoena
him
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
when
he
testifies
pleads
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
and
then
leaves
the
grand
jury
room,
it's
very
common
for
that
grand
jury
who
had
just
heard
him
plea
that
privilege
to
indict
him.
incidentally,
such
a
procedure
would
be
illegal
in
new
york.
and
this
type
of
situation
has
been
upheld
many,
many
times.
i
think
it's
far
more
questionable
than
what
happened
here.
because
here,
truly,
the
grand
jury
and
the
district
attorney
did
not
call
this
man
in
order
to
have
him
say
anything
that
would
be
used
against
him
in
a
bribery
case.
they
weren’t
interested
in
bribery.
they
would
have
forgone
for
all
times
any
bribery
prosecution.
they
were
only
interested
in
learning
about
the
background
of
the
assault
and
getting
into
this
area
involving
so
to
speak
bigger
and
better
things.
and
i
think
that
this
must
be
kept
in
mind
and
i
just
would
say
one
word
about
this
business
of
counsel.
now,
it's
true.
this
is
what
happened.
he
was
explained
the
meaning
of
immunity
and
he
went
outside
presumably
his
attorney
was
with
him
in
the
court
and
then
the
grand
jury
came
back
and
granted
him
immunity.
it
was
explained
to
him
again
and
the
witness
said,
“well,
okay.
i'm
going
to
answer
the
questions
but
can
i
just
talk
to
my
lawyer
for
a
second?”
and
the
prosecutor
said,
“well,
no,
you
don’t
really
have
to
because
you
have
immunity.”
now
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea.
of
course,
it
would’ve
been
much
better
to
let
the
man
go
outside.
it
wouldn’t
have
changed
anything
because
presumably
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,
your
honor,
he
was
unaware
that
there
was
any
type
of
bribery
proceeding
pending
so
he
couldn’t
have
talk
about
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,
that’s
true.
we
can
see
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
we
offered
him
complete
immunity,
transactional
immunity
but
transactional
immunity
is
a
matter
of
state
law
and
we
contend
that
this
was
not
a
transactional
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
it
was
explained
to
him
and
he
had
an
attorney
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
grand
jury
and
he
had
a
lawyer
presumably
outside
who
he
consulted
with.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,
an
answer
to
that
[voice
overlap],
the
court
of
appeals
considered
that
problem.
and
let
me
just
read
you
their
answer,
in
gold
versus
menna
when
they
reconsidered
this
situation,
they
said,
“since
piccirillo’s
answers
did
not
form
the
basis
of
the
present
indictment,
his
claim
that
his
constitutional
right
to
counsel
was
violated
because
he
was
not
permitted
to
confer
with
his
attorneys
without
merit
because
his
answered
weren’t
used.
no
prejudice
did
or
could
result
for
the
attorney
could
have
done
nothing
more
for
piccirillo
than
to
assure
that
he
was
given
the
immunity
which
in
fact
he
did
receive.”
so
he
got
it
anyway.
piccirillo
situation
is
to
be
distinguished
from
that
of
a
witness
who
denied
permission
to
confer
with
his
counsel,
refuses
to
answer
and
is
held
in
contempt.
such
a
witness
might
properly
claim
that
had
he
been
given
an
opportunity
to
obtain
advice
from
his
lawyer,
he
would
undoubtedly
have
testified
and
thereby
been
spared
a
prosecution
on
a
contempt
charge.
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
if
the
court
please,
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
just
mention
two
things
before
i
actually
get
into
the
discussion
of
the
law.
first,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question,
i
think
it's
safe
to
assume
that
the
grand
jury
that
voted
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
the
same
jury
that
did
here,
the
defendant
testified.
i
believe
this
was
an
extended
grand
jury,
normally
in
kings
county
the
jury
sits
to
periods
of
30
or
60
days.
but
i
believe
this
jury
sat
for
an
extended
period,
something
like
a
year
or
so.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
i
believe
that
it
was
the
jury
with
the
same
people
that
heard
him
testified.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
yes,
that’s
true.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
your
honor,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
looking
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
hindsight,
tactically
speaking,
that
would
have
been
a
better
procedure,
however
the
question
here
is
whether
the
procedure
violated
the
constitutional
requirements.
and
with
your
honor’s
permission
i
would
prefer
to
wait
and
discuss
that
point
after
the
first
one.
and
second,
i
think
it's
important
to
place
the
facts
of
what
happened
here
in
their
proper
perspective.
and
what
i'm
going
to
discuss
now
is
in
the
record,
it
was
mentioned
on
sentence
and
so
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
these
are
not
things
that
have
not
been
in
this
case.
this
case
led
to
a
scandal
and
basically
in
new
york
county,
involving
(inaudible),
involving
the
new
york
housing
authority.
now,
apparently
the
victim
in
this
case,
a
person
by
the
name
of
jack
graham
was
employed
by
the
housing
authority.
and
apparently,
there
was
something
about
him
revealing
some
of
the
things
that
had
been
going
on
and
he
had
been
apparently
talking
to
police
or
the
district
attorney.
and
the
petitioner
here
and
co-defendant,
who
was
no
longer
alive,
were
hired
to
beat
this
fellow
up.
and
they
met
him
one
night
in
the
parking
lot
of
his
home,
they
assaulted
him,
they
hit
him
with
tire
irons.
this
occurred
in
march
of
1964.
now,
the
very
next
day,
when
he
was
being
arraigned
in
the
criminal
court,
the
bribe
offer
was
made
to
the
patrolman.
the
patrolman
advised
us
about
it,
we
advised
him
to
meet
the
petitioner
at
a
different
time.
he
did
and
we
had
mini-phone
equipment.
eventually,
the
petitioner
pleaded
guilty,
he
was
convicted
of
assault
and
he
was
sentenced
to
the
term
of
imprisonment.
now,
approximately
a
year
later,
while
he
was
serving
their
sentence,
he
was
called
to
the
grand
jury.
he
had
not
been
arrested
or
in
any
way,
there
had
been
no
proceedings
instituted
regarding
the
bribery
conviction.
now,
when
the
grand
jury
called
him
in,
they
weren’t
interested
in
prosecuting
this
man
for
bribery
at
all.
they
were
interested
in
finding
out,
who
paid
him
to
commit
the
assault
and
to
get
into
the
background
of
this
whole
thing.
they
wanted
names,
they
wanted
to
know
when
the
meeting
took
place
and
so
forth
and
this
is
how
this
case
arose.
and
so
in
march
1965,
the
witness
was
called
back
and
was
given
immunity.
now,
new
york
has
a
use
plus
transactional
immunity
statute.
the
statutes
are
reprinted
in
both
petitioner’s
and
respondent’s
briefs.
and
that
statute
protects
a
witness
from
the
use
of
his
testimony,
plus
fruits
or
leads
and
the
statute
also
gives
him
transactional
immunity,
regarding
any
manner
or
thing,
concerning
which
he
testifies.
now,
that’s
clear.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
decided
if
analyzing
counselman
versus
hitchcock,
the
murphy
case,
and
all
of
the
relevant
decisions.
that
the
only
thing
that
constitution
required
was,
that
a
witness
be
given
use
plus-fruits
immunity
and
that
the
transactional
portion
of
the
new
york
statute
was
not
mandated
by
the
federal
constitution.
then
the
court
concluded
that
the
new
york
statute
was
passed,
because
of
the
dicta
in
counselman
and
that
it
really
was
the
intention
of
the
legislature
to
give
the
witness
no
more
than
the
constitution
would
require
if
to
give
any
witness.
and
so,
the
court
held
that
the
new
york
statute
only
prevented
the
use
of
his
testimony
plus-fruits
or
leads.
then
seven
months
later,
the
court
overruled
this
case,
but
only
to
the
extent
of
its
interpretation
of
the
second
portion
of
the
new
york
statute.
in
other
words,
it
said,
“we
were
right.
we
still
believe
that
the
constitution
only
requires
a
use
plus-fruits
immunity.”
however,
the
new
york
statute
is
clear
and
there
really
has
never
been
any
doubt.
and
we
must
interpret
the
statute
according
to
its
plain
language.
and
so
we
hold
that
the
new
york
statute
does
give
transactional
immunity,
although
it's
not
required
by
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
no,
i
don’t
believe
there
was
any
change,
it's
very
interesting,
i
believe
judge
keating
who
wrote
the
majority
of
opinion
had
left
the
court
though.
when
we
argued
this
case
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
we
really
didn’t
even
argue
this
point.
and
so,
we
were
quite
surprise
when
the
court
decided
that
the
new
york
statue,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
was
not
an
immunity
statute.
apparently,
they
just
felt
that
they
had
misinterpreted
the
statute.
i
think
it's
clear
from
reading
gold
versus
menna
and
nothing
more.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
that’s
right,
because
we
all
assumed
that
new
york
statute
granted
transaction
immunity,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
now,
i
think
that’s
very
important,
and
it's
important
for
this
reason,
if
transaction
immunity
or
first
let
me
say
this,
then
he
was
brought
into
the
grand
jury
in
1965
and
questioned
about
the
events
leading
up
to
the
assault
and
there’s
a
lot
of
testimony.
he
was
asked
many,
many
questions,
but
as
a
matter
of
introduction,
of
course,
the
testimony
started
of
by
the
prosecutor
saying
to
him,
“now,
you’ve
been
indicted
--
you’ve
been
convicted
of
assault
and
you’re
serving
a
sentence
for
it
and
isn’t
it
true
that
has
all
occurred
on
such,
and
such
a
date
where
you
hit
this
man
with
a
tire
iron.”
and
the
word
“tire
iron”
was
mentioned.
now,
it
was
argued
that
by
use
of
tire
iron,
that
the
defendant
got
immunity
from
prosecution
for
the
bribery,
because
when
he
made
the
bribe
offer
to
the
officer,
he
said,
he
offered
him
money,
in
exchange
for
changing
his
testimony
and
losing
the
tire
iron.
and
so,
the
argument
was
made
that
because
the
phrase
or
the
two-words
“tire
iron”
was
used
in
the
grand
jury,
that
this
meant
that
the
defendant
testified
to
a
thing
or
matter
as
set
forth
in
the
new
york
statute.
now,
if
transactional
immunity
is
required
by
--
incidentally,
the
court
below,
all
the
way
down
the
line
held,
as
matter
of
fact
that
this
was
not
a
thing
testified
to
and
that
the
testimony
he
gave
had
no
relation,
as
matter
of
fact,
to
the
testimony
which
supported
the
indictment.
now,
this
is
important
because
if
transaction
immunity
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution,
then
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
or
wasn’t
a
thing
as
specified
in
the
new
york
state
statute
is
a
matter
of
federal
importance
and
it
is
to
be
decided
by
uniform
standard.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
only
thing
that
the
constitution
requires
is
a
use
plus
fruits
immunity,
then
when
new
york
decided
whether
this
crime
as
bribery
was
one
of
the
things
testified
too
in
the
grand
jury
becomes
strictly
a
matter
of
a
state
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
and
there
was
no
federal
constitutional
question
involved.
and
so
it
is
necessary
to
decide
whether
transactional
immunity
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution.
now,
the
petitioner
relies
a
great
deal
on
the
case
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock.
now,
it's
our
position
that
counselman
is
not
the
law
anymore
that
it
has
been
overruled
or
that
if
it
hasn’t,
it
should
be.
and
that
the
consequences
of
our
holding
in
counselman
are
much
greater
and
dangerous
today
than
they
we're
in
the
days
when
it
was
decided.
we
also
take
the
position
at
the
murphy
versus
the
waterfront
commission
case
and
malloy
versus
hogan
have
closed
this
question.
and
that
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
constitution
only
requires
a
witness
to
be
put
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
pleaded
his
privilege
or
as
if
he
had
never
testified.
in
other
words,
he
is
to
get
only
that
protection
that
the
constitution
gives
him.
and
to
protect
the
use
by
any
government
of
the
testimony
he
gives
and
the
leads
obtained
from
or
the
fruits
of
that
testimony
would
do
that.
to
give
him
transactional
protection
is
to
give
him
a
benefit
not
required
by
the
constitution
and
it's
a
benefit
which
each
and
every
state
should
have
the
right
to
decide
for
themselves.
that
is
whether
they
want
to
give
it
to
them
or
not.
now,
this
is
really
the
key
issue
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
there
really
is
not
much
doubt
about
the
law
in
this
area.
now,
this
court
in
murphy
said
that
we
hold
the
constitutional
rule
to
be
that
a
state
witness
may
not
be
compelled
to
give
testimony
which
may
be
incriminating
on
the
federal
law
unless
the
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits
cannot
be
used
in
any
manner
by
federal
officials
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
we
conclude
moreover,
that
in
order
to
implement
this
constitutional
rule
and
accommodate
the
interest
of
the
state
and
federal
governments
in
investigating
and
prosecuting
crime,
the
federal
government
must
be
prohibited
for
making
any
such
use
of
compelled
testimony
and
its
fruits.
this
exclusionary
rule
while
permitting
the
states
to
secure
information
necessary
for
effective
law
enforcement
leaves
the
witness
and
the
federal
government
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
if
the
witness
had
claimed
this
privilege
in
the
absence
of
a
state
granted
immunity.
and
in
footnote
18,
in
that
decision
made
it
clear
as
far
as
the
rationale
was
concerned
that
this
court
was
only
saying
that
use
plus
fruits
was
required.
and
the
footnote
indicates
that
once
a
defendant
has
been
granted
immunity
and
compelled
to
testify
in
a
state
proceeding,
and
then
he
was
later
indicted
in
the
federal
jurisdiction
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
federal
government
to
show
that
the
source
of
the
evidence
used
against
in
was
untainted
and
did
not
in
any
way
stem
from
the
evidence
he
gave
before
state
grand
jury
which
indicated
that
each
government
would
be
free
to
prosecute
or
obtain
indictments
against
the
witness
provided
that
were
totally
completely
independent.
and
this,
i
submit
would
be
the
same
situation
that
a
witness
would
find
himself
in
if
he
never
were
a
witness,
if
he
were
never
compelled
to
testify.
you're
sort
of
saying
to
a
witness
tell
us
things;
give
us
information
which
we
intend
to
use
against
other
people
sort
of
off
the
record.
we're
not
going
to
use
it
against
you,
use
it
in
any
way
to
obtain
evidence
against
you.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
something
comes
up
clearly
from
an
independent
source,
we
do
not
want
to
be
prohibited
from
doing
what
we
normally
could
do.
now,
the
statement
in
counselman
which
caused
all
the
problem
was
a
dicta
in
that
decision.
now,
that
case
declared
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional
because
in
that
case
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
statute
only
gave
use
immunity
and
did
not
protect
mr.
counselman
from
the
federal
government’s
using
the
fruits
of
his
testimony
or
obtaining
leads
from
his
testimony.
and
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
statement
which
has
been
discussed
very
often
came
later
on
in
the
opinion
and
was
not
necessary
to
its
decision.
now,
this
was
pointed
out
in
the
murphy
case,
in
this
case,
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
new
jersey’s
opinion
in
the
zicarelli
case
which
i
submit
as
highly
persuasive.
also,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
effect
of
the
decision
in
counselman
was
not
very
great
because
you
had
the
two
sovereignties
doctrine.
and
it
really
made
no
difference
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
because
the
fifth
amendment
could
not
be
pleaded
in
the
state
prosecution
and
vice
versa
--
the
opposite
was
true.
however,
since
this
court’s
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan
applying
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
states
has
come
down
a
holding
such
as
petitioner
suggests
counselman
requires
would
have
disastrous
effects
on
law
enforcement
throughout
the
united
states.
and
i
suggest
that
if
the
basis
for
counselman
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
was
decided
no
longer
exist,
then
counselman
should
be
reevaluated.
now,
many
courts
have
considered
this
problem
and
have
taken
the
position
and
this
court
has
overruled
counselman
even
though
it
didn’t
specifically
say
so
in
the
murphy
decision.
for
instance,
in
new
jersey,
in
the
zicarelli
case,
the
supreme
court
said
we,
and
incidentally,
new
jersey
enacted
a
statute
which
only
gave
use
plus
fruits
immunity,
this
statute
was
enacted
after
murphy
was
decided.
and
so
the
legislature
took
the
position
that
this
court
had
overruled
counselman
and
the
state
was
now
free
to
take
away
the
transactional
portion
of
the
protection
that
had
previously
afforded
witnesses.
and
so
it
passed
the
new
statute.
and
the
statute
was
tested
and
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
i
understand
the
case
is
here
on
a
sort
of
application
at
this
time.
and
the
court
said,
“we
heretofore
deemed
the
constitution
to
require
immunity
against
use
of
testimony
rather
than
immunity
from
prosecution.”
and
recently
all
legislatures
in
adopting
the
model
state
immunity
act
substituted
an
immunity
from
use
for
an
immunity
from
prosecution
which
i've
just
referred
to.
there
is
a
difference
in
that
murphy
dealt
with
a
federal
state
setting,
whereas
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
claim
that
our
statute
does
not
protect
the
witness
from
prosecution
under
state
law.
but
the
question
involved
is
the
same.
in
other
words,
what
immunity
of
the
fifth
amendment
requires
in
exchange
for
a
compulsion
to
answer.
the
values
involved
are
the
same.
we
see
no
sensible
basis
for
different
answer.
gardner
versus
broderick
treated
the
issue
as
one
and
the
same
siding
both
counselman
and
murphy.
murphy
held
and
gardner
repeated
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
protection
only
from
the
use
of
the
compelled
testimony
and
the
leads
it
furnishes
and
that
protection
of
our
statute
expressly
provides.
so
we
have
new
jersey
taking
that
field.
you
have
new
york
of
course
taking
that
view
in
this
case
and
in
the
many
cases.
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
judge
friendly
writing
for
the
majority
in
the
uniformed
sanitation
case.
it
took
the
same
view
and
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
in
two
cases
falls
at
the
(inaudible).
also,
california
in
interpreting
murphy
agreed
that
complete
immunity
such
as
what's
discussed
in
counselman
was
not
required
by
the
constitution
and
that
answers
could
be
compelled
as
long
there
was
immunity
from
federal
and
state
use
of
the
testimony
and
its
fruits.
i
also
point
out
that
maine
has
taken
the
same
view
and
kansas
in
dicta
has
also
agreed.
now,
the
appellants
cites
--
the
petitioners
cites
statutes
in
a
very
impressive
compilation
at
the
end
of
our
brief
four
or
in
the
appendix
of
all
of
the
50
states
in
which
it
is
clear
that
most
of
the
states
have
adopted
transactional
immunity
statutes.
and
apparently,
this
is
done
to
argue
that
if
the
states
felt
it
was
necessary
to
give
that
type
of
protection,
then
it
would’ve
be
persuasive.
and
this
court
order
be
persuaded
that
that
it
too
should
take
the
same
position.
i
would
like
to
point
out
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief
that
prior
to
counselman,
the
situation
was
just
the
opposite.
most
every
state
had
only
a
use
plus
fruits
statue.
but
because
of
the
dicta
in
the
counselman,
it
was
thought
that
transactional
immunity
was
now
required
as
a
federal
proposition
and
all
of
the
states
amended
their
statues.
and
so
since
the
state
statutes
were
only
changed
because
of
counselman,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
argue
that
these
statutes
are
themselves
persuasive
is
truly
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
also,
the
practical
effects
of
the
contrary
rule
or
as
the
--
or
of
a
rule
as
petitioner
argues
is
quite,
quite
important.
now,
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
murphy
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
if
this
court
adopts
a
transactional
rule,
it
will
in
effect
be
abrogating
the
immunity
statutes
in
every
single
state
because
a
state
cannot
give
federal
transaction
immunities
beyond
it's
power
but
since
because
of
malloy,
a
witness
can
now
plead
his
federal
privilege
in
a
state
proceeding
he
can
successfully
forward
an
attempt
of
any
state
to
give
him
immunity
and
secure
his
answers.
and
the
court
--
and
mr.
justice
white
said,
“the
invalid
--
that
this
would
invalidate
the
immunity
statutes
of
the
50
states
since
the
states
are
without
authority
to
confer
immunity
from
federal
prosecutions
and
would
thereby
cut
deeply
and
significantly
into
traditional
and
important
areas
of
state
authority
and
responsibility
in
our
federal
system.”
of
course
the
converse
should
be
looked
at
also.
if
it
could
be
said,
and
i
don’t
urge
it
that
a
state
did
have
the
power
to
grant
federal
transactional
immunity
in
a
state
proceeding,
and
that
if
the
state
in
granting
immunity
--
transactional
immunity
bound
the
federal
government,
then
the
effect
is
even
worse
because
if
that
were
true,
a
state
of
course
without
consultation
with
the
federal
government
and
without
the
government’s
knowledge
could
sterilize
the
federal
government
from
ever
proceeding
against
an
individual.
and
the
example
of
course
comes
to
mind
at
the
situation
where
the
government
may
have
a
case
prepared
against
a
particular
individual,
the
case
may
be
either
in
the
grand
jury
or
be
ready
to
go
to
a
grand
jury
when
all
of
a
sudden
it's
discovered
that
this
witness
in
a
state
prosecution
which
may
not
have
been
very
important
admitted
in
ans
--
responsive
answers
to
relevant
questions
that
he
had
committed
various
federal
crimes
which
were
then
under
investigation
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
so
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
witness
would’ve
--
would
gain
a
federal
immunity
and
would
prevent
the
federal
government
from
taking
any
sort
of
action.
now,
the
other
argument
is
made
that
we
used
the
testimony
of
this
witness
against
him
on
the
bribery
case
and
that
the
grand
jury
heard
him
testify
and
that
the
--
he
furnished
the
background
and
the
motive
for
their
action.
now,
the
record
i
think
dispels
that
argument.
first,
it
is
conceded
that
motive
on
the
new
york
law
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
but
the
court
of
appeals
decided
as
did
the
original
supreme
court
in
new
york
that
the
testimony
of
patrolman
sewell
was
complete
in
and
off
itself
that
any
testimony
given
by
this
witness
was
insubstantial
and
played
no
part
in
the
subsequent
indictment.
now,
of
course
the
only
thing
that
this
witness
said
was
that
he
had
used
the
tire
iron.
but
that
was
repeated
by
sewell
in
the
grand
jury
who
testified
that
when
the
bribe
offer
was
made
to
him,
the
witness
admitted
the
assault
admitted
using
a
tire
iron
and
admitted
many
things
and
this
is
in
the
appendix.
so,
that
the
testimony
of
this
witness
was
totally
unnecessary
to
support
the
indictment
which
was
obtained.
i
think
that
merely
using
the
same
grand
jury
does
not
in
and
of
itself
violate
anyone’s
rights.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
it
is
common
practice
for
instance
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
present
a
case
against
a
man
have
all
the
evidence
completed
and
then
subpoena
him
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
when
he
testifies
pleads
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
and
then
leaves
the
grand
jury
room,
it's
very
common
for
that
grand
jury
who
had
just
heard
him
plea
that
privilege
to
indict
him.
incidentally,
such
a
procedure
would
be
illegal
in
new
york.
and
this
type
of
situation
has
been
upheld
many,
many
times.
i
think
it's
far
more
questionable
than
what
happened
here.
because
here,
truly,
the
grand
jury
and
the
district
attorney
did
not
call
this
man
in
order
to
have
him
say
anything
that
would
be
used
against
him
in
a
bribery
case.
they
weren’t
interested
in
bribery.
they
would
have
forgone
for
all
times
any
bribery
prosecution.
they
were
only
interested
in
learning
about
the
background
of
the
assault
and
getting
into
this
area
involving
so
to
speak
bigger
and
better
things.
and
i
think
that
this
must
be
kept
in
mind
and
i
just
would
say
one
word
about
this
business
of
counsel.
now,
it's
true.
this
is
what
happened.
he
was
explained
the
meaning
of
immunity
and
he
went
outside
presumably
his
attorney
was
with
him
in
the
court
and
then
the
grand
jury
came
back
and
granted
him
immunity.
it
was
explained
to
him
again
and
the
witness
said,
“well,
okay.
i'm
going
to
answer
the
questions
but
can
i
just
talk
to
my
lawyer
for
a
second?”
and
the
prosecutor
said,
“well,
no,
you
don’t
really
have
to
because
you
have
immunity.”
now
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
your
honor,
i
have
no
idea.
of
course,
it
would’ve
been
much
better
to
let
the
man
go
outside.
it
wouldn’t
have
changed
anything
because
presumably
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,
your
honor,
he
was
unaware
that
there
was
any
type
of
bribery
proceeding
pending
so
he
couldn’t
have
talk
about
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,
that’s
true.
we
can
see
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
we
offered
him
complete
immunity,
transactional
immunity
but
transactional
immunity
is
a
matter
of
state
law
and
we
contend
that
this
was
not
a
transactional
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
it
was
explained
to
him
and
he
had
an
attorney
--
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
grand
jury
and
he
had
a
lawyer
presumably
outside
who
he
consulted
with.
mr.
stanley
m.
meyer
well,
an
answer
to
that
[voice
overlap],
the
court
of
appeals
considered
that
problem.
and
let
me
just
read
you
their
answer,
in
gold
versus
menna
when
they
reconsidered
this
situation,
they
said,
“since
piccirillo’s
answers
did
not
form
the
basis
of
the
present
indictment,
his
claim
that
his
constitutional
right
to
counsel
was
violated
because
he
was
not
permitted
to
confer
with
his
attorneys
without
merit
because
his
answered
weren’t
used.
no
prejudice
did
or
could
result
for
the
attorney
could
have
done
nothing
more
for
piccirillo
than
to
assure
that
he
was
given
the
immunity
which
in
fact
he
did
receive.”
so
he
got
it
anyway.
piccirillo
situation
is
to
be
distinguished
from
that
of
a
witness
who
denied
permission
to
confer
with
his
counsel,
refuses
to
answer
and
is
held
in
contempt.
such
a
witness
might
properly
claim
that
had
he
been
given
an
opportunity
to
obtain
advice
from
his
lawyer,
he
would
undoubtedly
have
testified
and
thereby
been
spared
a
prosecution
on
a
contempt
charge.
thank
you.
