justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
tax
aliens
in
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
an
alien
has
lived
there
for
10
years
and
has
had
a
job
but
he
has
paid
taxes
and
if
he
loses
his
job
and
needs
relief,
he
can’t
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
we’ll
that’s
probably
--
maybe
perhaps
that’s
true
for
your
citizens
too,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
equal
protection
here
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know
if
the
charter
or
the
treaty
would
prevent
the
united
states
from
insisting
that
the
alien
leave
the
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
this
charter
requires
aliens
to
be
treated
like
u.s.
citizens
in
all
respects,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
except,
in
the
most
important
part
that
they
can
deport
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
not
treating
them
very
equally
with
the
citizens.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
so
that
the
charter
covers
everything
and
the
treaty
--
charter
covers
anything
except
what
is
inherent
in
the
status
of
an
alien.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
there
are
some
ways
the
treaty
doesn’t
keep
the
united
states
from
treating
aliens
differently.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
federal
government
say
about
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
residency
in
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
are
you
suggesting
that
what
congress
has
done
is
as
vulnerable
as
what
the
state
has
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
the
social
security
act
expressly
said
that
no
plan
shall
--
we
shall
finance,
no
plans,
that
include
aliens,
you
would
say
it
beyond
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
their
obligation
--
do
aliens
have
in
the
country
than
citizens?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don’t
know
of
any
obligations
that
the
citizen
has
that
an
alien
doesn’t;
a
resident
alien?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
the
state
get
away
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ching,
how
about
if
--
i
can't
remember
whether
congress
has
its
provision
or
not
but
if
an
alien
is
admitted,
i
take
it
that
it’s
because
one
of
the
reasons
is
that’s
he’s
not
going
to
be
public
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
he’s
admitted
and
later
he
becomes
a
public
charge,
is
he
then
subject
to
deportation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
congress
did
provide
that,
that
your
entrance
is
conditioned
on
remaining
self-supported?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
love
to
stay
right
on
your
topic,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
what
respect,
would
you
think
make
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
the
discrimination
isn’t
on
race
or
national
origin
but
on
citizenship?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
might
make
a
difference
in
the
test
that
would
reapply
it
to
a
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
you
would
have
to
had
some
compelling
state
interest
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words
pennsylvania
could
give
welfare
to
everybody
except
mexicans.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
not
that
the
federal
government
contributes
nothing
to
this
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
mistake?
to
put
them
out
or
put
them
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
did
takahashi
say
the
thing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
provision
that
only
citizens
and
not
aliens
maybe
employed
on
public
projects?
do
you
think
that
kind
of
a
rule
could
survive
takahashi?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
crane,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
crane,
neither
crane
nor
hines
survived
takahashi?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
crane
has
already
been
overruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course
crane
didn’t
deal
with
welfare
benefits
either
so
it’s
no
authority
even
if
it
were
still
alive.
i
mean,
either
of
them
--
haven’t
been
overruled.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
preceded
by
heim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
against
mccall
on
the
same
day
and
they
both
relied
on
the
mccrady,
didn’t
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
fundamental
position
here
on
an
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is,
why
isn’t
that
as
much
on
a
fortiori,
why
isn't
the
pennsylvania
law
incompetent
with
the
section
1981?
justice
byron
r.
white
can’t
you
make
exactly
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
voting,
exactly
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
what
i
suspect
and
i
assume
that
if
this
case
is
affirmed
you’ll
be
back
here
next
year
with
a
voting
case.
and
i’d
like
to
get
your
definitive
answer
to
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
particularly
if
the
office
for
which
the
voting
case
comes
up
is
for
local
sheriff
or
city
councilor.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
at
the
same
time
haven’t
they
chosen
not
to
become
naturalized?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
they
have
chosen
not
to
become
naturalized
by
becoming
literate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
–
let's
assume
anyone
here
could’ve
become
a
citizen,
quite
literate,
but
he
chose
not
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
takahashi
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
what
do
you
think
about
the
law
of
the
united
states
which
said
that
no
alien
may
become
a
citizen,
who
at
that
time
may
apply
for
citizenship
or
public
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
congress
also
went
on
and
said
that
no
welfare
benefit
shall
be
taken
by
anyone
until
they
become

justice

(voice

an
equal

clause?
justice

clause,
the

of

--
justice
byron

white
why
can't
then
they
say
that
(inaudible)

do
you
tax
aliens
in

justice

and
if
an

he
has
paid

and
if
he
loses
his

and
needs
relief,
he
can’t
get
it?
justice
byron

white
we’ll
that’s
probably
--
maybe
perhaps
that’s
true
for
your
citizens
too,
isn’t
it?
justice

the

mean
that
you
would
have
to
had
some
compelling
state
interest
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words
pennsylvania
could
give
welfare
to
everybody
except
mexicans.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
not
that
the
federal
government
contributes
nothing
to
this
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
mistake?
to
put
them
out
or
put
them
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
did
takahashi
say
the
thing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
provision
that
only
citizens
and
not
aliens
maybe
employed
on
public
projects?
do
you
think
that
kind
of
a
rule
could
survive
takahashi?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
crane,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
crane,
neither
crane
nor
hines
survived
takahashi?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
crane
has
already
been
overruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course
crane
didn’t
deal
with
welfare
benefits
either
so
it’s
no
authority
even
if
it
were
still
alive.
i
mean,
either
of
them
--
haven’t
been
overruled.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
preceded
by
heim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
against
mccall
on
the
same
day
and
they
both
relied
on
the
mccrady,
didn’t
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
fundamental
position
here
on
an
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is,
why
isn’t
that
as
much
on
a
fortiori,
why
isn't
the
pennsylvania
law
incompetent
with
the
section
1981?
justice
byron
r.
white
can’t
you
make
exactly
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
voting,
exactly
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
what
i
suspect
and
i
assume
that
if
this
case
is
affirmed
you’ll
be
back
here
next
year
with
a
voting
case.
and
i’d
like
to
get
your
definitive
answer
to
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
particularly
if
the
office
for
which
the
voting
case
comes
up
is
for
local
sheriff
or
city
councilor.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
at
the
same
time
haven’t
they
chosen
not
to
become
naturalized?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
they
have
chosen
not
to
become
naturalized
by
becoming
literate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
–
let's
assume
anyone
here
could’ve
become
a
citizen,
quite
literate,
but
he
chose
not
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
takahashi
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
about
the
law
of
the
united
states
which
said
that
no
alien
may
become
a
citizen,
who
at
that
time
may
apply
for
citizenship
or
public
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
congress
also
went
on
and
said
that
no
welfare
benefit
shall
be
taken
by
anyone
until
they
become
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
an
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
due
process
clause,
the
counterpart
of
federal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
then
they
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
tax
aliens
in
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
an
alien
has
lived
there
for
10
years
and
has
had
a
job
but
he
has
paid
taxes
and
if
he
loses
his
job
and
needs
relief,
he
can’t
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
we’ll
that’s
probably
--
maybe
perhaps
that’s
true
for
your
citizens
too,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
equal
protection
here
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know
if
the
charter
or
the
treaty
would
prevent
the
united
states
from
insisting
that
the
alien
leave
the
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
this
charter
requires
aliens
to
be
treated
like
u.s.
citizens
in
all
respects,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
except,
in
the
most
important
part
that
they
can
deport
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
not
treating
them
very
equally
with
the
citizens.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
so
that
the
charter
covers
everything
and
the
treaty
--
charter
covers
anything
except
what
is
inherent
in
the
status
of
an
alien.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
there
are
some
ways
the
treaty
doesn’t
keep
the
united
states
from
treating
aliens
differently.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
federal
government
say
about
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
residency
in
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
are
you
suggesting
that
what
congress
has
done
is
as
vulnerable
as
what
the
state
has
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
the
social
security
act
expressly
said
that
no
plan
shall
--
we
shall
finance,
no
plans,
that
include
aliens,
you
would
say
it
beyond
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
their
obligation
--
do
aliens
have
in
the
country
than
citizens?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don’t
know
of
any
obligations
that
the
citizen
has
that
an
alien
doesn’t;
a
resident
alien?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
the
state
get
away
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ching,
how
about
if
--
i
can't
remember
whether
congress
has
its
provision
or
not
but
if
an
alien
is
admitted,
i
take
it
that
it’s
because
one
of
the
reasons
is
that’s
he’s
not
going
to
be
public
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
he’s
admitted
and
later
he
becomes
a
public
charge,
is
he
then
subject
to
deportation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
congress
did
provide
that,
that
your
entrance
is
conditioned
on
remaining
self-supported?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
love
to
stay
right
on
your
topic,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
what
respect,
would
you
think
make
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
the
discrimination
isn’t
on
race
or
national
origin
but
on
citizenship?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
might
make
a
difference
in
the
test
that
would
reapply
it
to
a
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
you
would
have
to
had
some
compelling
state
interest
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words
pennsylvania
could
give
welfare
to
everybody
except
mexicans.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
not
that
the
federal
government
contributes
nothing
to
this
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
do
that?
justice
byron

white
what
was
the
mistake?
to
put
them
out
or
put

in

do

do
you
think

of
a

could

takahashi?
justice
byron

white
well,
the
crane,
did
it?
justice
byron

white
then
crane,
neither
crane
nor
hines
survived
takahashi?
justice
byron

white
do
you
think

has
already
been

of
