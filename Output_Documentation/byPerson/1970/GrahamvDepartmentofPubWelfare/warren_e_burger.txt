thank
you
mr.

mr.
ching?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
could
be
classifications
among
aliens
that
some
could
be
permitted
--
some
would
have
a
right
to
vote
and
some
would
not
depending
on
their
place
of
origin?
chief

e.

i
think

recess

and
i
require
you
to

your
rebuttal.
mr.

mr.

chief

warren
e.

your
motion
is
granted,
we’ll
be
glad
to
hear
from
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
whether
these
parties
or
either
of

ever
paid
any
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
work.
mr.
stein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
you
think
the
limitations
which
state
places
on
voters
and
holding
public
office
is
rooted
in
some
of
the
same
kind
of
hostility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
a
good
argument
for
giving
all
those
people
to
vote,
the
right
to
run
for
office
so
they
can
protect
their
interests?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
protect
it
from
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
soon
as
you
use
the
term
like
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
process,
haven’t
you
established
an
invidious
category
for
the
people
against
whom
that
wall
is
erected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
aren’t
the
wartime,
these
measures
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
reference
to
voting
and
holding
office
are
not
war
measures.
most
of
the
states
have
had
these
since
time
immemorial,
haven’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
right
now
they
don’t
have
the
right
that
you’re
arguing
for
as
yet,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
your
arguments,
don’t
we
have
to
resolve
the
constitutional
issues
precisely
as
those
600,000
of
the
700,000
for
aliens?
does
it
make
any
difference
how
many
or
how
few
aliens
are
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
is
that
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
had
the
state
of
pennsylvania
setting
aside,
well,
lets
say
arbitrarily
$600
million
for
this
program
and
600
of
the
700,000
total
eligible
people
were
aliens
would
that
not
work
a
hardship
to
the
reduction
of
the
amount
paid
to
the
citizens,
if
we
accept
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
not
talking
about
the
saving.
i
was
talking
about
the
sharing,
the
division
of
it.
chief

warren
e.

shapiro
didn’t

chief

warren
e.
burger
shapiro
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
aliens,
did
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
if
the
alien
receiving
this
benefit,
spends
six
months
of
the
year
in
some
other
country,
his
native
country
or
any
other
country,
do
you
--
what
would
you
think
would
happen
to
his
right,
the
right
that
you
argue
for,
to
receive
that
benefit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
could
only
receive
the
assistance
for
the
days
and
months
that
they
spent
within
the
state’s
center
of
limitation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
by
the
same
token,
residents
of
scotland
or
panama
or
elsewhere
would
be
discouraged
from
coming
to
pennsylvania
in
the
first
instance
as
compared
with
other
states
that
did
not
draw
this
line.
chief

warren
e.

well,
isn’t
it
just
as
much
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
an
economic
impulse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
your
argument
mean
that
every
state
must
have
the
same
--
must
meet
a
certain
standard
of
welfare
payments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
florida
gives
twice
as
much
as
indiana,
doesn’t
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

--
all
right
within
the
pattern
of
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i’m
just
talking
about
the
urge
to
go

florida
would
be
twice

mr.
flam,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
flam.
mr.
ching?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
could
be
classifications
among
aliens
that
some
could
be
permitted
--
some
would
have
a
right
to
vote
and
some
would
not
depending
on
their
place
of
origin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
recess
for
lunch
now.
and
i
require
you
to
divide
your
rebuttal.
mr.
flam,
you
have
about
10
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
apparently
are
none,
thank
you
mr.
flam.
thank
you
mr.
ching.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
727,
sailer
against
leger
and
jervis.
mr.
work.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
motion
is
granted,
we’ll
be
glad
to
hear
from
mr.
stein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
whether
these
parties
or
either
of
them
ever
paid
any
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
work.
mr.
stein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
you
think
the
limitations
which
state
places
on
voters
and
holding
public
office
is
rooted
in
some
of
the
same
kind
of
hostility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
that
a
good
argument
for
giving
all
those
people
to
vote,
the
right
to
run
for
office
so
they
can
protect
their
interests?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
protect
it
from
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
soon
as
you
use
the
term
like
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
process,
haven’t
you
established
an
invidious
category
for
the
people
against
whom
that
wall
is
erected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
aren’t
the
wartime,
these
measures
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
reference
to
voting
and
holding
office
are
not
war
measures.
most
of
the
states
have
had
these
since
time
immemorial,
haven’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
right
now
they
don’t
have
the
right
that
you’re
arguing
for
as
yet,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
your
arguments,
don’t
we
have
to
resolve
the
constitutional
issues
precisely
as
those
600,000
of
the
700,000
for
aliens?
does
it
make
any
difference
how
many
or
how
few
aliens
are
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
is
that
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
had
the
state
of
pennsylvania
setting
aside,
well,
lets
say
arbitrarily
$600
million
for
this
program
and
600
of
the
700,000
total
eligible
people
were
aliens
would
that
not
work
a
hardship
to
the
reduction
of
the
amount
paid
to
the
citizens,
if
we
accept
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
not
talking
about
the
saving.
i
was
talking
about
the
sharing,
the
division
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
shapiro
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
alienage,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
shapiro
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
aliens,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
alien
receiving
this
benefit,
spends
six
months
of
the
year
in
some
other
country,
his
native
country
or
any
other
country,
do
you
--
what
would
you
think
would
happen
to
his
right,
the
right
that
you
argue
for,
to
receive
that
benefit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
could
only
receive
the
assistance
for
the
days
and
months
that
they
spent
within
the
state’s
center
of
limitation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
by
the
same
token,
residents
of
scotland
or
panama
or
elsewhere
would
be
discouraged
from
coming
to
pennsylvania
in
the
first
instance
as
compared
with
other
states
that
did
not
draw
this
line.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
it
just
as
much
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
an
economic
impulse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
your
argument
mean
that
every
state
must
have
the
same
--
must
meet
a
certain
standard
of
welfare
payments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
florida
gives
twice
as
much
as
indiana,
doesn’t
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
all
right
within
the
pattern
of
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i’m
just
talking
about
the
urge
to
go
to
florida
would
be
twice
as
good
for
people
who
are
on
relief
as
it
is
to
go
to
indiana.
you're
not
talking
about
--
you
were
addressing
yourself
to
this
right
to
travel,
the
movement
argument
as
i
understood
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
stein.
you
have
four
minutes
left
mr.
work
if
you
wish
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
work,
thank
you
mr.
stein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
work.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
