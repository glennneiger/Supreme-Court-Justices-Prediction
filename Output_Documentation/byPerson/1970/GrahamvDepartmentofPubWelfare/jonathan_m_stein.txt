mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
before
us
today,
a
case
of
alien
discrimination
which
is
rooted
in
the
prejudice
and
ill-will
of
an
early
year
in
pennsylvania.
the
fact
of
this
was
past
at
a
time
of
war
hysteria
and
anti-alien
feelings
in
pennsylvania
was
made
clear
in
a
memorandum
commission,
a
study
commissioned
by
the
state,
by
the
welfare
department
which
is
part
of
the
record.
in
addition,
this
law
which
was
passed
in
1939
was
passed
within
five
days
of
the
state's
alien
registration
act
which
this
court
struck
down
in
hines
v.
davidowitz
and
in
a
sense,
the
motivations
behind
a
citizenship
requirement
not
unlike
the
motivations
behind
the
residency
requirement
as
in
shapiro
v.
thompson,
both
basically
rest
in
a
basic
distrust
or
dislike
perhaps
a
fear
of
the
foreigner,
of
the
out
of
state
person.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
maybe
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
voting
area
and
this
political
public
office
area
is
very
much
distinguishable
from
this
area
before
the
court
today.
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
in
acting
to
protect
its
political
processes,
the
governmental
processes
and
they
just
--
and
they
don’t
have
that
latitude
in
the
area
which
is
before
us
today
of
social
or
economic
benefits
which
are
based
upon
a
classification
on
alienage.
that’s
the
teaching
of
takahashi
which
says
that
a
state
is
very
much
limited
in
making
a
classification
based
on
alienage.
i
might
point
out
in
response
to
the
commonwealth’s
argument
that
takahashi
wasn’t
an
alienage
case,
that
the
provision
of
the
state
law
based
upon
a
federal
citizenship
requirement
did
not
mention
any
racial
exclusion.
and
footnotes
both
in
takahashi
and
oyama
point
to
japanese
and
other
groups
which
were
affected
by
that
provision.
more
over
this
court
had
an
opportunity
in
takahashi
to
view
this
as
a
racial
case,
as
an
anti-japanese
case.
and
in
fact,
this
option
is
made
clear
by
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
murphy
who
perhaps
would
have
preferred
to
view
it
as
an
anti-japanese
case,
but
that’s
not
the
way
the
majority
of
the
court
view
the
case.
the
majority
of
the
court
viewed
the
case
and
equated
alienage
with
color
as
both
being
impermissible
basis
for
classification
both
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
both
under
the
civil
rights
act.
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
add
your
honor
that
it
is
in
conflict
both
of
the
equal
protection
argument
and
those
statutes
that
put
that
clause
in
effect
like
section
1981,
like
the
section
2000
(d)
in
42
u.s.c.
which
promulgate
that
principle
of
equality
between
citizens
and
aliens.
we
have
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
or
aliens,
permanent
resident
aliens
of
pennsylvania
who
have
had
a
history
of
productive
and
sustained
work
before
becoming
ill
and
requiring
public
assistance.
the
classification
established
is
one
between
two
indistinguishable
classes,
needy
residents
of
pennsylvania
on
the
one
hand
who
are
citizens,
needy
residents
of
the
state
who
are
not
u.s.
citizens,
and
we
maintain
that
on
either
of
the
two
equal
protection
tests,
this
classification
must
fall
either
on
the
basis
that
there
is
simply
no
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
permissible
legislative
purpose
or
on
--
perhaps
an
equally
applicable
test
that
the
state
must
meet
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
in
validating
and
justifying
this
discrimination.
the
latter
test
we
suggest
is
applicable
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
suspect
criteria.
suspect
because
history
has
shown
that
when
this
criterion
is
used
to
basic
classification,
it’s
often
been
amassed
where
simply
a
rational
prejudice
against
that
particular
group.
i
might
add
in
addition,
we’re
dealing
with
a
group
which
is
a
(inaudible)
minority,
disenfranchised
and
which
is
politically
defenseless
and
can’t
rely
upon
the
political
processes
for
redress
of
grievances.
this
is
an
additional
reason
why
we
suggest
that
a
special
scrutiny
test
is
applicable.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
suggest
your
honor
that
that
realm
of
political
activity
and
that
realm
of
holding
public
office
and
voting
does
involve
the
government’s
attempt
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
processes.
perhaps
there
is
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
perhaps
a
concern
about
loyalty
to
another
country.
it
may
well
be
that
that
may
not
be
that
rational
a
basis.
this
court
in
oyama,
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
where
mr.
justice
murphy
and
rutledge
suggested
that
assuming
a
priority,
the
disloyalty
of
aliens
cannot
be
done.
but
we’re
just
suggesting
now
that
because
the
scenario
of
political
concern
involving
the
integrity
of
the
political
processes,
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
to
legislate,
to
regulate
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
not
necessarily,
there
are
certain
exigencies
as
certain
wartime
concerns
where
national
security
which
may
be
not
unrelated
to
voting
and
holding
public
office.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
that’s
right.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
but
voting
can
involve
questions
of
national
security
of
political
questions
which
the
government,
in
our
view
has
much
wider
latitude
in
regulating
than
than
they
do
in
the
fishing
license,
welfare
benefit
scheme.
what
is
really,
i
think
at
issue
here
in
terms
of
what
the
basis
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
really
an
assumption
that
the
aliens
are
less
deserving
than
citizens
and
it
has
been
judicially
recognized
both
by
the
court
below,
both
by
the
purdy
&
fitzpatrick
california
supreme
court
opinion
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
that
aliens
have
contributed
their
energies
and
the
tax
dollars
to
this
country.
they
have
often
been
long
domiciled
in
this
country
with
the
history,
work
history,
a
productive
history
of
contributing
to
the
states
of
the
nation.
they
have
established
families
and
reared
children.
they
have
entered
into
this
social
and
religious
fabric
of
this
nation.
and
of
course
they
have
obligations
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
think
one
could
and
that’s
why
i
would
only
suggest
that
the
two
areas
are
distinguishable
but
it
may
well
be
that
for
certain
voting
rights
as
my
colleague
from
arizona,
mr.
ching
suggested
that
voting
privileges
maybe
those
privileges
which
are
and
should
be
extended
to
aliens.
i’m
not
closing
my
mind
to
that,
you
know,
to
that
point.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
definitive
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
answer
today
is
that
there
--
since
there
is
wide
latitude
for
state
government
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
political
concerns
that
right
now
aliens
do
not
have
that
right
to
vote
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
fact
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
your
honor,
in
fact
they
do
in
terms
of
how
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
interpreted
in
its
application
to
aliens.
this
case
in
one
sense
presents
a
stronger
factual
pattern
and
does
the
shapiro
v.
thompson
residency
case.
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification.
in
the
residency
case,
you
had
newcomers
to
the
state,
people
living
in
the
state
less
than
one
year.
in
our
case,
we
have
people
who
have
been
in
the
state
for
many
years
who
have
clearly
made
a
contribution
to
the
state
and
to
the
nation.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no
your
honor.
in
many
cases
as
the
record
shows,
many
resident
aliens
cannot
become
naturalized
simply
because
they
can’t
pass
the
literacy
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
that
is
a
choice
of
volition,
a
question
of
volition,
i
would
say
that
for
people,
at
least
literacy
is
not
always
for
everyone
a
voluntary
act.
i
mean
there
are
people
who
haven’t
been
literate
and
can
speak
english
so
they
maybe
quite
literate
in
russian
or
spanish
due
to
no
fault
of
their
own.
and
so
that
that
aspect
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
think
that’s
really
an
irrelevant
concern
because
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens
irrespective
of
their
desire
to
become
naturalized,
irrespective
of
their
literacy
qualifications.
the
pennsylvania
in
a
census
is
saying
that
they're
trying
to
save
money
for
their
own
people.
but
through
this
citizenship
bar,
they
are
in
fact
denying
assistance
to
their
own
people,
to
residents
of
pennsylvania.
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
to
these
classifications.
this
conservation
of
funds
argument,
we
maintain
also
comes
down
to
really
to
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
what
has
amounted
to
a
casual
and
quite
pointless
discrimination.
the
court
below
questioned
the
physical
concern
when
i
pointed
out
that
but
65
or
70
people
each
year
are
denied
general
assistance
in
pennsylvania,
in
a
state
where
there
are
over
700,000
people
on
assistance.
in
addition,
pennsylvania
although
they’re
saving
money
for
u.s.
citizens
and
denying
it
to
aliens
or
giving
money
to
aliens
in
the
federal
categories.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
it
doesn’t
your
honor.
it
only
makes
a
difference
as
to
the
state’s
argument
in
suggesting
a
rational
basis
in
a
physical
concern.
the
court
below
said
where
is
the
physical
concern
really
when
merely
65
or
70
people
are
at
issue.
but
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
mean
to
say
its
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right.
it
is
not
relevant
in
the
abstracts
of
the
constitutional
issue
but
in
this
case
where
the
sole
basis
for
justification
resides
in
conserving
of
state
funds.
one
has
to
scrutinize
that
state
interest
and
see
it
for
what
it
is
which
is
we
suggest
a
fiction
in
this
case,
because
there’s
really
no
physical
concern
here.
this
was
an
argument
which
is
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
a
discrimination
made
30
odd
years
ago
when
prejudice
ill-will
against
aliens
was
really
the
motivation
for
this
statute.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
your
honor,
the
clear
holding
of
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
established
that
the
saving
of
welfare
cost
if
that’s
what
the
state
is
concerned
in
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
can’t
--
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
numbers
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
state
can
base
a
classification
upon
alienage,
whether
there
are
60,
whether
there
are
600
or
longer.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
pardon?
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
fundamental
freedom
there
of
interstate
travel
which
established
the
basis
for
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
we
are
suggesting
in
this
case
that
the
inherently
suspect
criterion
of
alienage
would
justify
applications
of
that
test.
but
even
if
one
doesn’t
apply
that
test,
using
the
traditional
test
of
a
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
acceptable
legislative
purpose,
this
law
fails.
in
fact,
shapiro
itself
suggested
that
the
residency
requirement
would
seem
to
fail
even
on
the
test
of
the
rational
relationship
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
would
not
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
receive
welfare
in
panama
or
great
britain
as
the
two
named
plaintiffs
here.
residents
in
the
state
without
being
a
durational
residency
requirement
would
be
a
valid
requirement
because
that
cuts
equally
for
u.s.
citizens
or
aliens
and
so
that,
you
know,
the
fact
that
that
a
state
can
--
we
maintain
a
state
could
and
could
validly
set
residence
in
the
state
as
a
bona
fide
constitutional
requirement
for
receiving
assistance.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
if
they
are
in
the
state,
they
would
be
illegible
like
other
u.s.
citizens
in
pennsylvania
to
receive
assistance.
they
couldn’t
go
some
place
else
and
ask
for
benefits
when
they’re
not
residing
in
pennsylvania.
the
commonwealth
does
give
much
leeway
or
support
on
williams
v.
dandridge,
dandridge
v.
williams,
a
recent
decision
of
this
court.
and
that
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case
since
that
case
did
not
deal
with
inherently
suspect
criterion
such
as
alienage.
in
fact,
there
the
argument
used
of
saving
a
welfare
cost
really
cuts
quite
far
because
it
can
justify
a
variety
of
discrimination,
invidious
discriminations
which
are
clearly
not
permissible
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
wish
to
further
suggest
that
the
--
well,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
distinguishing
fact
drawn
on
takahashi
that
earning
a
livelihood
really
is
not
a
distinguishing
factor
in
this
case.
both
takahashi
and
both
this
case
deal
with
access
to
necessities
of
life.
in
fact
there’s
a
stronger
argument
in
our
case
for
that
point
because
at
least
in
takahashi,
there
was
a
bar
to
one
aspect
of
employment
and
conceivably
those
fishermen
could
have
had
access
to
some
other
applications.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right,
i
think
crane
--
i
think
it
is
quite
weak
on
its
own
grounds.
i
think
the
underlying
doctrine,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
is
something
which
takahashi,
at
least
very
seriously
questioned
if
not
overruled.
and
if
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
itself
which
the
state
does
rely
upon
really
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
because
there’s
no
special
public
interest
in
tax
dollars
where
you
have
aliens
themselves
contributing
to
the
tax
dollars
to
that
resource.
and
that
whole
rationale
of
early
cases
of
somehow
a
property
interest
among
members
of
the
state
just
doesn’t
hold
when
those
members
of
the
state
or
aliens
have
contributed
to
that
source
of
resources.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
that
is
a
different
case
precisely
because
the
federal
government
has
plenary
powers
in
that
instance
of
regulating
expressed
powers
in
the
constitution
of
regulating
immigration
naturalization.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
the
constitution
would
grant
that
power
to
congress
if
congress
was
employing
their
immigration
and
naturalization
powers.
if
they
did
this
as
part
of
an
immigration
naturalization
scheme
so
they
could
justify
that
exercise
of
power.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
through
the
fifth
amendment
the
equal
protection
--
through
the
due
process
causes
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
is.
and
there
would
obviously
be
a
balancing
between
the
equal
protection
principles
through
the
due
process
clause
on
these
plenary
powers.
i
would
suggest
that
congress
could
probably
have
that
power
in
terms
of
that
balance
between
those
powers.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
did
state
that
that
congress
could
not
authorize
states
to
deny
equal
protection
to
a
class
discriminated
against
and
because
you
do
have
in
this
instance
expressed
immigration
powers
given
to
congress,
what
might
be
reasonable
and
constitutional
for
congress
to
do
may
not
be
or
constitutional
or
reasonable
for
states
to
do.
i
might
go
into
this
by
continuing
my
argument
that
the
same
scrutiny
which
the
equal
protection
clause
does
require
of
this
legislation
is
also
required
because
this
is
an
area
that
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government
and
as
heim
states
must
be
an
area
confined
to
the
narrowest
limits
to
a
state
regulation.
there
is
clear
conflict
with
federal
policy
and
law.
there’s
a
whole
scheme,
a
very
complex
scheme
of
federal
regulation
in
this
area
which
does
exclude
paupers
from
the
country
and
does
provide
for
deportation.
in
a
very
limited
case
where
the
person
becomes
a
public
charge
within
five
years
from
reasons
which
predated
entry
but
there
is
also
like
a
humane
aspect
to
that
provision
of
the
law
that
once
you
are
legally
admitted
in
this
country
you
can’t
--
and
you
have
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
in
any
state.
you
have
a
right
to
live
under
all
equal
privileges
of
citizens
under
non-discriminatory
laws.
the
pennsylvania
is
acting
in
this
case
irrespective
of
whether
the
person’s
been
here
for
five
years,
irrespective
of
what
the
cause
of
indigency
was.
in
addition,
the
effect
of
their
act,
as
was
stipulated
below,
the
effect
of
pennsylvania’s
act
is
to
discourage
continued
residence
in
pennsylvania
and
force
needy
resident
aliens
out
of
pennsylvania
into
other
states
that
would
be
hospitable
to
them
to
meet
their
needs.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
well
might
be
although,
the
record
doesn’t
suggest
that
fact.
the
record
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yeah!
there
may
well
be
some
aliens
who
might
think
that,
although
they
would
probably
be
people
who’d
be
excluded
because
the
federal
law
really
almost
insures
and
this
is
where
the
state’s
interest
is
really
insured
by
federal
law
that
those
admitted
into
the
country
will
be
productive
citizens.
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
secretary
of
labor
approval
for
the
jobs
they
had
so
there
is
a
very
real
screening
process
to
prevent
those
people
who
states
might
consider
a
burden
from
coming
into
the
united
states
but
this
aspect
of
segregating
poor
aliens
into
other
states
really
flies
in
the
face
of
our
concept
of
a
federal
union.
the
edwards
v.
california
case
established
that
interstate
migration
of
poor
people
is
an
aspect
of
national
concern
which
doesn’t
admit
of
diverse
treatment
of
the
states.
and
this
is
precisely
what
pennsylvania
is
doing
by
denying
resident
aliens
their
rights,
their
federal
privileges
of
entrance
and
abode
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no.
i
think
the
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
the
basis
of
giving
different
payments
is
based
upon
alienage.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
yes.
but
as
an
aspect
of
a
federally
conferred
privilege
under
truax
and
takahashi
which
state
clearly
that
the
alien
has
a
right
to
enter
and
abide,
to
live
among
the
community,
perhaps
among
these
ethnic
or
religious
fellows,
and
can’t
be
forced
out
of
the
state
as
what
is
happening
here
in
pennsylvania
where
it’s
clear,
it's
not
speculation.
it’s
stipulated
fact
below
that
poor
aliens
are
being
forced
out
of
the
state
as
a
result
of
this
requirement.
i
might
further
add
in
terms
conflict
with
federal
law,
i
think
a
number
of
the
civil
right
statutes
have
been
cited.
i
don’t
think
they
require
further
elaboration
at
this
point
but
there
are
other
conflicts
of
federal
law.
six
months
state
residence
is
a
requirement
of
naturalization
to
become
a
u.s.
citizen,
and
for
that
alien
who
is
forced
out
of
a
particular
state
and
who
wishes
to
become
naturalized,
that
six
months
period
of
naturalization
is
terminated
and
is
interrupted.
i
might
also
in
terms
of
embroiling
ourselves
with
other
nations,
both
panama
and
great
britain
grant
public
benefits
to
aliens,
to
u.s.
citizens
in
panama
and
great
britain.
and
if
either
of
these
states
were
to
retaliate
against
americans,
they
wouldn’t
be
retaliating
against
pennsylvanians
but
they're
retaliating
against
americans
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
i
believe
panama
gives
various
social
security
benefits
and
hospital
benefits
to
aliens
in
the
country.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
don’t
think
they
do.
great
britain
does
though
and
u.s.
citizens
in
great
britain
are
eligible
for
supplementary
benefits.
i’d
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
we
are
really
as
president
kennedy's
book
set
forth
a
nation
of
immigrants
with
a
proud
--
with
a
tradition
and
i
guess
our
strengths
of
our
history
reside
in
the
fact
that
when
immigrants
have
come
to
our
shores
and
to
live
among
us,
they
have
been
afforded
equal
treatment.
this
tradition
has
often
required
the
protection
and
vigilance
of
this
court
when
such
immigrants
have
been
met
with
ill
will
and
prejudice
when
they
have
come
to
this
shore
and
appellees
stand
before
this
court
today
seeking
this
protection
and
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
before
us
today,
a
case
of
alien
discrimination
which
is
rooted
in
the
prejudice
and
ill-will
of
an
early
year
in
pennsylvania.
the
fact
of
this
was
past
at
a
time
of
war
hysteria
and
anti-alien
feelings
in
pennsylvania
was
made
clear
in
a
memorandum
commission,
a
study
commissioned
by
the
state,
by
the
welfare
department
which
is
part
of
the
record.
in
addition,
this
law
which
was
passed
in
1939
was
passed
within
five
days
of
the
state's
alien
registration
act
which
this
court
struck
down
in
hines
v.
davidowitz
and
in
a
sense,
the
motivations
behind
a
citizenship
requirement
not
unlike
the
motivations
behind
the
residency
requirement
as
in
shapiro
v.
thompson,
both
basically
rest
in
a
basic
distrust
or
dislike
perhaps
a
fear
of
the
foreigner,
of
the
out
of
state
person.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
maybe
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
voting
area
and
this
political
public
office
area
is
very
much
distinguishable
from
this
area
before
the
court
today.
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
in
acting
to
protect
its
political
processes,
the
governmental
processes
and
they
just
--
and
they
don’t
have
that
latitude
in
the
area
which
is
before
us
today
of
social
or
economic
benefits
which
are
based
upon
a
classification
on
alienage.
that’s
the
teaching
of
takahashi
which
says
that
a
state
is
very
much
limited
in
making
a
classification
based
on
alienage.
i
might
point
out
in
response
to
the
commonwealth’s
argument
that
takahashi
wasn’t
an
alienage
case,
that
the
provision
of
the
state
law
based
upon
a
federal
citizenship
requirement
did
not
mention
any
racial
exclusion.
and
footnotes
both
in
takahashi
and
oyama
point
to
japanese
and
other
groups
which
were
affected
by
that
provision.
more
over
this
court
had
an
opportunity
in
takahashi
to
view
this
as
a
racial
case,
as
an
anti-japanese
case.
and
in
fact,
this
option
is
made
clear
by
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
murphy
who
perhaps
would
have
preferred
to
view
it
as
an
anti-japanese
case,
but
that’s
not
the
way
the
majority
of
the
court
view
the
case.
the
majority
of
the
court
viewed
the
case
and
equated
alienage
with
color
as
both
being
impermissible
basis
for
classification
both
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
both
under
the
civil
rights
act.
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
add
your
honor
that
it
is
in
conflict
both
of
the
equal
protection
argument
and
those
statutes
that
put
that
clause
in
effect
like
section
1981,
like
the
section
2000
(d)
in
42
u.s.c.
which
promulgate
that
principle
of
equality
between
citizens
and
aliens.
we
have
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
or
aliens,
permanent
resident
aliens
of
pennsylvania
who
have
had
a
history
of
productive
and
sustained
work
before
becoming
ill
and
requiring
public
assistance.
the
classification
established
is
one
between
two
indistinguishable
classes,
needy
residents
of
pennsylvania
on
the
one
hand
who
are
citizens,
needy
residents
of
the
state
who
are
not
u.s.
citizens,
and
we
maintain
that
on
either
of
the
two
equal
protection
tests,
this
classification
must
fall
either
on
the
basis
that
there
is
simply
no
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
permissible
legislative
purpose
or
on
--
perhaps
an
equally
applicable
test
that
the
state
must
meet
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
in
validating
and
justifying
this
discrimination.
the
latter
test
we
suggest
is
applicable
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
suspect
criteria.
suspect
because
history
has
shown
that
when
this
criterion
is
used
to
basic
classification,
it’s
often
been
amassed
where
simply
a
rational
prejudice
against
that
particular
group.
i
might
add
in
addition,
we’re
dealing
with
a
group
which
is
a
(inaudible)
minority,
disenfranchised
and
which
is
politically
defenseless
and
can’t
rely
upon
the
political
processes
for
redress
of
grievances.
this
is
an
additional
reason
why
we
suggest
that
a
special
scrutiny
test
is
applicable.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
suggest
your
honor
that
that
realm
of
political
activity
and
that
realm
of
holding
public
office
and
voting
does
involve
the
government’s
attempt
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
processes.
perhaps
there
is
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
perhaps
a
concern
about
loyalty
to
another
country.
it
may
well
be
that
that
may
not
be
that
rational
a
basis.
this
court
in
oyama,
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
where
mr.
justice
murphy
and
rutledge
suggested
that
assuming
a
priority,
the
disloyalty
of
aliens
cannot
be
done.
but
we’re
just
suggesting
now
that
because
the
scenario
of
political
concern
involving
the
integrity
of
the
political
processes,
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
to
legislate,
to
regulate
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
not
necessarily,
there
are
certain
exigencies
as
certain
wartime
concerns
where
national
security
which
may
be
not
unrelated
to
voting
and
holding
public
office.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
that’s
right.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
but
voting
can
involve
questions
of
national
security
of
political
questions
which
the
government,
in
our
view
has
much
wider
latitude
in
regulating
than
than
they
do
in
the
fishing
license,
welfare
benefit
scheme.
what
is
really,
i
think
at
issue
here
in
terms
of
what
the
basis
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
really
an
assumption
that
the
aliens
are
less
deserving
than
citizens
and
it
has
been
judicially
recognized
both
by
the
court
below,
both
by
the
purdy
&
fitzpatrick
california
supreme
court
opinion
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
that
aliens
have
contributed
their
energies
and
the
tax
dollars
to
this
country.
they
have
often
been
long
domiciled
in
this
country
with
the
history,
work
history,
a
productive
history
of
contributing
to
the
states
of
the
nation.
they
have
established
families
and
reared
children.
they
have
entered
into
this
social
and
religious
fabric
of
this
nation.
and
of
course
they
have
obligations
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
think
one
could
and
that’s
why
i
would
only
suggest
that
the
two
areas
are
distinguishable
but
it
may
well
be
that
for
certain
voting
rights
as
my
colleague
from
arizona,
mr.
ching
suggested
that
voting
privileges
maybe
those
privileges
which
are
and
should
be
extended
to
aliens.
i’m
not
closing
my
mind
to
that,
you
know,
to
that
point.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
definitive
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
answer
today
is
that
there
--
since
there
is
wide
latitude
for
state
government
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
political
concerns
that
right
now
aliens
do
not
have
that
right
to
vote
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
fact
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
your
honor,
in
fact
they
do
in
terms
of
how
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
interpreted
in
its
application
to
aliens.
this
case
in
one
sense
presents
a
stronger
factual
pattern
and
does
the
shapiro
v.
thompson
residency
case.
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification.
in
the
residency
case,
you
had
newcomers
to
the
state,
people
living
in
the
state
less
than
one
year.
in
our
case,
we
have
people
who
have
been
in
the
state
for
many
years
who
have
clearly
made
a
contribution
to
the
state
and
to
the
nation.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no
your
honor.
in
many
cases
as
the
record
shows,
many
resident
aliens
cannot
become
naturalized
simply
because
they
can’t
pass
the
literacy
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
that
is
a
choice
of
volition,
a
question
of
volition,
i
would
say
that
for
people,
at
least
literacy
is
not
always
for
everyone
a
voluntary
act.
i
mean
there
are
people
who
haven’t
been
literate
and
can
speak
english
so
they
maybe
quite
literate
in
russian
or
spanish
due
to
no
fault
of
their
own.
and
so
that
that
aspect
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
think
that’s
really
an
irrelevant
concern
because
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens
irrespective
of
their
desire
to
become
naturalized,
irrespective
of
their
literacy
qualifications.
the
pennsylvania
in
a
census
is
saying
that
they're
trying
to
save
money
for
their
own
people.
but
through
this
citizenship
bar,
they
are
in
fact
denying
assistance
to
their
own
people,
to
residents
of
pennsylvania.
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
to
these
classifications.
this
conservation
of
funds
argument,
we
maintain
also
comes
down
to
really
to
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
what
has
amounted
to
a
casual
and
quite
pointless
discrimination.
the
court
below
questioned
the
physical
concern
when
i
pointed
out
that
but
65
or
70
people
each
year
are
denied
general
assistance
in
pennsylvania,
in
a
state
where
there
are
over
700,000
people
on
assistance.
in
addition,
pennsylvania
although
they’re
saving
money
for
u.s.
citizens
and
denying
it
to
aliens
or
giving
money
to
aliens
in
the
federal
categories.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
it
doesn’t
your
honor.
it
only
makes
a
difference
as
to
the
state’s
argument
in
suggesting
a
rational
basis
in
a
physical
concern.
the
court
below
said
where
is
the
physical
concern
really
when
merely
65
or
70
people
are
at
issue.
but
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
mean
to
say
its
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right.
it
is
not
relevant
in
the
abstracts
of
the
constitutional
issue
but
in
this
case
where
the
sole
basis
for
justification
resides
in
conserving
of
state
funds.
one
has
to
scrutinize
that
state
interest
and
see
it
for
what
it
is
which
is
we
suggest
a
fiction
in
this
case,
because
there’s
really
no
physical
concern
here.
this
was
an
argument
which
is
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
a
discrimination
made
30
odd
years
ago
when
prejudice
ill-will
against
aliens
was
really
the
motivation
for
this
statute.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
your
honor,
the
clear
holding
of
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
established
that
the
saving
of
welfare
cost
if
that’s
what
the
state
is
concerned
in
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
can’t
--
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
numbers
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
state
can
base
a
classification
upon
alienage,
whether
there
are
60,
whether
there
are
600
or
longer.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
pardon?
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
fundamental
freedom
there
of
interstate
travel
which
established
the
basis
for
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
we
are
suggesting
in
this
case
that
the
inherently
suspect
criterion
of
alienage
would
justify
applications
of
that
test.
but
even
if
one
doesn’t
apply
that
test,
using
the
traditional
test
of
a
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
acceptable
legislative
purpose,
this
law
fails.
in
fact,
shapiro
itself
suggested
that
the
residency
requirement
would
seem
to
fail
even
on
the
test
of
the
rational
relationship
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
would
not
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
receive
welfare
in
panama
or
great
britain
as
the
two
named
plaintiffs
here.
residents
in
the
state
without
being
a
durational
residency
requirement
would
be
a
valid
requirement
because
that
cuts
equally
for
u.s.
citizens
or
aliens
and
so
that,
you
know,
the
fact
that
that
a
state
can
--
we
maintain
a
state
could
and
could
validly
set
residence
in
the
state
as
a
bona
fide
constitutional
requirement
for
receiving
assistance.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
if
they
are
in
the
state,
they
would
be
illegible
like
other
u.s.
citizens
in
pennsylvania
to
receive
assistance.
they
couldn’t
go
some
place
else
and
ask
for
benefits
when
they’re
not
residing
in
pennsylvania.
the
commonwealth
does
give
much
leeway
or
support
on
williams
v.
dandridge,
dandridge
v.
williams,
a
recent
decision
of
this
court.
and
that
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case
since
that
case
did
not
deal
with
inherently
suspect
criterion
such
as
alienage.
in
fact,
there
the
argument
used
of
saving
a
welfare
cost
really
cuts
quite
far
because
it
can
justify
a
variety
of
discrimination,
invidious
discriminations
which
are
clearly
not
permissible
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
wish
to
further
suggest
that
the
--
well,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
distinguishing
fact
drawn
on
takahashi
that
earning
a
livelihood
really
is
not
a
distinguishing
factor
in
this
case.
both
takahashi
and
both
this
case
deal
with
access
to
necessities
of
life.
in
fact
there’s
a
stronger
argument
in
our
case
for
that
point
because
at
least
in
takahashi,
there
was
a
bar
to
one
aspect
of
employment
and
conceivably
those
fishermen
could
have
had
access
to
some
other
applications.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right,
i
think
crane
--
i
think
it
is
quite
weak
on
its
own
grounds.
i
think
the
underlying
doctrine,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
is
something
which
takahashi,
at
least
very
seriously
questioned
if
not
overruled.
and
if
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
itself
which
the
state
does
rely
upon
really
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
because
there’s
no
special
public
interest
in
tax
dollars
where
you
have
aliens
themselves
contributing
to
the
tax
dollars
to
that
resource.
and
that
whole
rationale
of
early
cases
of
somehow
a
property
interest
among
members
of
the
state
just
doesn’t
hold
when
those
members
of
the
state
or
aliens
have
contributed
to
that
source
of
resources.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
that
is
a
different
case
precisely
because
the
federal
government
has
plenary
powers
in
that
instance
of
regulating
expressed
powers
in
the
constitution
of
regulating
immigration
naturalization.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
the
constitution
would
grant
that
power
to
congress
if
congress
was
employing
their
immigration
and
naturalization
powers.
if
they
did
this
as
part
of
an
immigration
naturalization
scheme
so
they
could
justify
that
exercise
of
power.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
through
the
fifth
amendment
the
equal
protection
--
through
the
due
process
causes
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
is.
and
there
would
obviously
be
a
balancing
between
the
equal
protection
principles
through
the
due
process
clause
on
these
plenary
powers.
i
would
suggest
that
congress
could
probably
have
that
power
in
terms
of
that
balance
between
those
powers.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
did
state
that
that
congress
could
not
authorize
states
to
deny
equal
protection
to
a
class
discriminated
against
and
because
you
do
have
in
this
instance
expressed
immigration
powers
given
to
congress,
what
might
be
reasonable
and
constitutional
for
congress
to
do
may
not
be
or
constitutional
or
reasonable
for
states
to
do.
i
might
go
into
this
by
continuing
my
argument
that
the
same
scrutiny
which
the
equal
protection
clause
does
require
of
this
legislation
is
also
required
because
this
is
an
area
that
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government
and
as
heim
states
must
be
an
area
confined
to
the
narrowest
limits
to
a
state
regulation.
there
is
clear
conflict
with
federal
policy
and
law.
there’s
a
whole
scheme,
a
very
complex
scheme
of
federal
regulation
in
this
area
which
does
exclude
paupers
from
the
country
and
does
provide
for
deportation.
in
a
very
limited
case
where
the
person
becomes
a
public
charge
within
five
years
from
reasons
which
predated
entry
but
there
is
also
like
a
humane
aspect
to
that
provision
of
the
law
that
once
you
are
legally
admitted
in
this
country
you
can’t
--
and
you
have
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
in
any
state.
you
have
a
right
to
live
under
all
equal
privileges
of
citizens
under
non-discriminatory
laws.
the
pennsylvania
is
acting
in
this
case
irrespective
of
whether
the
person’s
been
here
for
five
years,
irrespective
of
what
the
cause
of
indigency
was.
in
addition,
the
effect
of
their
act,
as
was
stipulated
below,
the
effect
of
pennsylvania’s
act
is
to
discourage
continued
residence
in
pennsylvania
and
force
needy
resident
aliens
out
of
pennsylvania
into
other
states
that
would
be
hospitable
to
them
to
meet
their
needs.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
well
might
be
although,
the
record
doesn’t
suggest
that
fact.
the
record
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yeah!
there
may
well
be
some
aliens
who
might
think
that,
although
they
would
probably
be
people
who’d
be
excluded
because
the
federal
law
really
almost
insures
and
this
is
where
the
state’s
interest
is
really
insured
by
federal
law
that
those
admitted
into
the
country
will
be
productive
citizens.
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
secretary
of
labor
approval
for
the
jobs
they
had
so
there
is
a
very
real
screening
process
to
prevent
those
people
who
states
might
consider
a
burden
from
coming
into
the
united
states
but
this
aspect
of
segregating
poor
aliens
into
other
states
really
flies
in
the
face
of
our
concept
of
a
federal
union.
the
edwards
v.
california
case
established
that
interstate
migration
of
poor
people
is
an
aspect
of
national
concern
which
doesn’t
admit
of
diverse
treatment
of
the
states.
and
this
is
precisely
what
pennsylvania
is
doing
by
denying
resident
aliens
their
rights,
their
federal
privileges
of
entrance
and
abode
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no.
i
think
the
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
the
basis
of
giving
different
payments
is
based
upon
alienage.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
yes.
but
as
an
aspect
of
a
federally
conferred
privilege
under
truax
and
takahashi
which
state
clearly
that
the
alien
has
a
right
to
enter
and
abide,
to
live
among
the
community,
perhaps
among
these
ethnic
or
religious
fellows,
and
can’t
be
forced
out
of
the
state
as
what
is
happening
here
in
pennsylvania
where
it’s
clear,
it's
not
speculation.
it’s
stipulated
fact
below
that
poor
aliens
are
being
forced
out
of
the
state
as
a
result
of
this
requirement.
i
might
further
add
in
terms
conflict
with
federal
law,
i
think
a
number
of
the
civil
right
statutes
have
been
cited.
i
don’t
think
they
require
further
elaboration
at
this
point
but
there
are
other
conflicts
of
federal
law.
six
months
state
residence
is
a
requirement
of
naturalization
to
become
a
u.s.
citizen,
and
for
that
alien
who
is
forced
out
of
a
particular
state
and
who
wishes
to
become
naturalized,
that
six
months
period
of
naturalization
is
terminated
and
is
interrupted.
i
might
also
in
terms
of
embroiling
ourselves
with
other
nations,
both
panama
and
great
britain
grant
public
benefits
to
aliens,
to
u.s.
citizens
in
panama
and
great
britain.
and
if
either
of
these
states
were
to
retaliate
against
americans,
they
wouldn’t
be
retaliating
against
pennsylvanians
but
they're
retaliating
against
americans
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
i
believe
panama
gives
various
social
security
benefits
and
hospital
benefits
to
aliens
in
the
country.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
don’t
think
they
do.
great
britain
does
though
and
u.s.
citizens
in
great
britain
are
eligible
for
supplementary
benefits.
i’d
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
we
are
really
as
president
kennedy's
book
set
forth
a
nation
of
immigrants
with
a
proud
--
with
a
tradition
and
i
guess
our
strengths
of
our
history
reside
in
the
fact
that
when
immigrants
have
come
to
our
shores
and
to
live
among
us,
they
have
been
afforded
equal
treatment.
this
tradition
has
often
required
the
protection
and
vigilance
of
this
court
when
such
immigrants
have
been
met
with
ill
will
and
prejudice
when
they
have
come
to
this
shore
and
appellees
stand
before
this
court
today
seeking
this
protection
and
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
before
us
today,
a
case
of
alien
discrimination
which
is
rooted
in
the
prejudice
and
ill-will
of
an
early
year
in
pennsylvania.
the
fact
of
this
was
past
at
a
time
of
war
hysteria
and
anti-alien
feelings
in
pennsylvania
was
made
clear
in
a
memorandum
commission,
a
study
commissioned
by
the
state,
by
the
welfare
department
which
is
part
of
the
record.
in
addition,
this
law
which
was
passed
in
1939
was
passed
within
five
days
of
the
state's
alien
registration
act
which
this
court
struck
down
in
hines
v.
davidowitz
and
in
a
sense,
the
motivations
behind
a
citizenship
requirement
not
unlike
the
motivations
behind
the
residency
requirement
as
in
shapiro
v.
thompson,
both
basically
rest
in
a
basic
distrust
or
dislike
perhaps
a
fear
of
the
foreigner,
of
the
out
of
state
person.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
maybe
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
voting
area
and
this
political
public
office
area
is
very
much
distinguishable
from
this
area
before
the
court
today.
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
in
acting
to
protect
its
political
processes,
the
governmental
processes
and
they
just
--
and
they
don’t
have
that
latitude
in
the
area
which
is
before
us
today
of
social
or
economic
benefits
which
are
based
upon
a
classification
on
alienage.
that’s
the
teaching
of
takahashi
which
says
that
a
state
is
very
much
limited
in
making
a
classification
based
on
alienage.
i
might
point
out
in
response
to
the
commonwealth’s
argument
that
takahashi
wasn’t
an
alienage
case,
that
the
provision
of
the
state
law
based
upon
a
federal
citizenship
requirement
did
not
mention
any
racial
exclusion.
and
footnotes
both
in
takahashi
and
oyama
point
to
japanese
and
other
groups
which
were
affected
by
that
provision.
more
over
this
court
had
an
opportunity
in
takahashi
to
view
this
as
a
racial
case,
as
an
anti-japanese
case.
and
in
fact,
this
option
is
made
clear
by
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
murphy
who
perhaps
would
have
preferred
to
view
it
as
an
anti-japanese
case,
but
that’s
not
the
way
the
majority
of
the
court
view
the
case.
the
majority
of
the
court
viewed
the
case
and
equated
alienage
with
color
as
both
being
impermissible
basis
for
classification
both
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
both
under
the
civil
rights
act.
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
add
your
honor
that
it
is
in
conflict
both
of
the
equal
protection
argument
and
those
statutes
that
put
that
clause
in
effect
like
section
1981,
like
the
section
2000
(d)
in
42
u.s.c.
which
promulgate
that
principle
of
equality
between
citizens
and
aliens.
we
have
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
or
aliens,
permanent
resident
aliens
of
pennsylvania
who
have
had
a
history
of
productive
and
sustained
work
before
becoming
ill
and
requiring
public
assistance.
the
classification
established
is
one
between
two
indistinguishable
classes,
needy
residents
of
pennsylvania
on
the
one
hand
who
are
citizens,
needy
residents
of
the
state
who
are
not
u.s.
citizens,
and
we
maintain
that
on
either
of
the
two
equal
protection
tests,
this
classification
must
fall
either
on
the
basis
that
there
is
simply
no
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
permissible
legislative
purpose
or
on
--
perhaps
an
equally
applicable
test
that
the
state
must
meet
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
in
validating
and
justifying
this
discrimination.
the
latter
test
we
suggest
is
applicable
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
suspect
criteria.
suspect
because
history
has
shown
that
when
this
criterion
is
used
to
basic
classification,
it’s
often
been
amassed
where
simply
a
rational
prejudice
against
that
particular
group.
i
might
add
in
addition,
we’re
dealing
with
a
group
which
is
a
(inaudible)
minority,
disenfranchised
and
which
is
politically
defenseless
and
can’t
rely
upon
the
political
processes
for
redress
of
grievances.
this
is
an
additional
reason
why
we
suggest
that
a
special
scrutiny
test
is
applicable.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
suggest
your
honor
that
that
realm
of
political
activity
and
that
realm
of
holding
public
office
and
voting
does
involve
the
government’s
attempt
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
processes.
perhaps
there
is
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
perhaps
a
concern
about
loyalty
to
another
country.
it
may
well
be
that
that
may
not
be
that
rational
a
basis.
this
court
in
oyama,
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
where
mr.
justice
murphy
and
rutledge
suggested
that
assuming
a
priority,
the
disloyalty
of
aliens
cannot
be
done.
but
we’re
just
suggesting
now
that
because
the
scenario
of
political
concern
involving
the
integrity
of
the
political
processes,
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
to
legislate,
to
regulate
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
not
necessarily,
there
are
certain
exigencies
as
certain
wartime
concerns
where
national
security
which
may
be
not
unrelated
to
voting
and
holding
public
office.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
that’s
right.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
but
voting
can
involve
questions
of
national
security
of
political
questions
which
the
government,
in
our
view
has
much
wider
latitude
in
regulating
than
than
they
do
in
the
fishing
license,
welfare
benefit
scheme.
what
is
really,
i
think
at
issue
here
in
terms
of
what
the
basis
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
really
an
assumption
that
the
aliens
are
less
deserving
than
citizens
and
it
has
been
judicially
recognized
both
by
the
court
below,
both
by
the
purdy
&
fitzpatrick
california
supreme
court
opinion
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
that
aliens
have
contributed
their
energies
and
the
tax
dollars
to
this
country.
they
have
often
been
long
domiciled
in
this
country
with
the
history,
work
history,
a
productive
history
of
contributing
to
the
states
of
the
nation.
they
have
established
families
and
reared
children.
they
have
entered
into
this
social
and
religious
fabric
of
this
nation.
and
of
course
they
have
obligations
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
think
one
could
and
that’s
why
i
would
only
suggest
that
the
two
areas
are
distinguishable
but
it
may
well
be
that
for
certain
voting
rights
as
my
colleague
from
arizona,
mr.
ching
suggested
that
voting
privileges
maybe
those
privileges
which
are
and
should
be
extended
to
aliens.
i’m
not
closing
my
mind
to
that,
you
know,
to
that
point.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
definitive
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
answer
today
is
that
there
--
since
there
is
wide
latitude
for
state
government
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
political
concerns
that
right
now
aliens
do
not
have
that
right
to
vote
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
fact
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
your
honor,
in
fact
they
do
in
terms
of
how
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
interpreted
in
its
application
to
aliens.
this
case
in
one
sense
presents
a
stronger
factual
pattern
and
does
the
shapiro
v.
thompson
residency
case.
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification.
in
the
residency
case,
you
had
newcomers
to
the
state,
people
living
in
the
state
less
than
one
year.
in
our
case,
we
have
people
who
have
been
in
the
state
for
many
years
who
have
clearly
made
a
contribution
to
the
state
and
to
the
nation.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no
your
honor.
in
many
cases
as
the
record
shows,
many
resident
aliens
cannot
become
naturalized
simply
because
they
can’t
pass
the
literacy
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
that
is
a
choice
of
volition,
a
question
of
volition,
i
would
say
that
for
people,
at
least
literacy
is
not
always
for
everyone
a
voluntary
act.
i
mean
there
are
people
who
haven’t
been
literate
and
can
speak
english
so
they
maybe
quite
literate
in
russian
or
spanish
due
to
no
fault
of
their
own.
and
so
that
that
aspect
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
think
that’s
really
an
irrelevant
concern
because
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens
irrespective
of
their
desire
to
become
naturalized,
irrespective
of
their
literacy
qualifications.
the
pennsylvania
in
a
census
is
saying
that
they're
trying
to
save
money
for
their
own
people.
but
through
this
citizenship
bar,
they
are
in
fact
denying
assistance
to
their
own
people,
to
residents
of
pennsylvania.
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
to
these
classifications.
this
conservation
of
funds
argument,
we
maintain
also
comes
down
to
really
to
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
what
has
amounted
to
a
casual
and
quite
pointless
discrimination.
the
court
below
questioned
the
physical
concern
when
i
pointed
out
that
but
65
or
70
people
each
year
are
denied
general
assistance
in
pennsylvania,
in
a
state
where
there
are
over
700,000
people
on
assistance.
in
addition,
pennsylvania
although
they’re
saving
money
for
u.s.
citizens
and
denying
it
to
aliens
or
giving
money
to
aliens
in
the
federal
categories.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
it
doesn’t
your
honor.
it
only
makes
a
difference
as
to
the
state’s
argument
in
suggesting
a
rational
basis
in
a
physical
concern.
the
court
below
said
where
is
the
physical
concern
really
when
merely
65
or
70
people
are
at
issue.
but
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
mean
to
say
its
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right.
it
is
not
relevant
in
the
abstracts
of
the
constitutional
issue
but
in
this
case
where
the
sole
basis
for
justification
resides
in
conserving
of
state
funds.
one
has
to
scrutinize
that
state
interest
and
see
it
for
what
it
is
which
is
we
suggest
a
fiction
in
this
case,
because
there’s
really
no
physical
concern
here.
this
was
an
argument
which
is
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
a
discrimination
made
30
odd
years
ago
when
prejudice
ill-will
against
aliens
was
really
the
motivation
for
this
statute.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
your
honor,
the
clear
holding
of
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
established
that
the
saving
of
welfare
cost
if
that’s
what
the
state
is
concerned
in
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
can’t
--
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
numbers
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
state
can
base
a
classification
upon
alienage,
whether
there
are
60,
whether
there
are
600
or
longer.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
pardon?
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
fundamental
freedom
there
of
interstate
travel
which
established
the
basis
for
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
we
are
suggesting
in
this
case
that
the
inherently
suspect
criterion
of
alienage
would
justify
applications
of
that
test.
but
even
if
one
doesn’t
apply
that
test,
using
the
traditional
test
of
a
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
acceptable
legislative
purpose,
this
law
fails.
in
fact,
shapiro
itself
suggested
that
the
residency
requirement
would
seem
to
fail
even
on
the
test
of
the
rational
relationship
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
would
not
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
receive
welfare
in
panama
or
great
britain
as
the
two
named
plaintiffs
here.
residents
in
the
state
without
being
a
durational
residency
requirement
would
be
a
valid
requirement
because
that
cuts
equally
for
u.s.
citizens
or
aliens
and
so
that,
you
know,
the
fact
that
that
a
state
can
--
we
maintain
a
state
could
and
could
validly
set
residence
in
the
state
as
a
bona
fide
constitutional
requirement
for
receiving
assistance.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
if
they
are
in
the
state,
they
would
be
illegible
like
other
u.s.
citizens
in
pennsylvania
to
receive
assistance.
they
couldn’t
go
some
place
else
and
ask
for
benefits
when
they’re
not
residing
in
pennsylvania.
the
commonwealth
does
give
much
leeway
or
support
on
williams
v.
dandridge,
dandridge
v.
williams,
a
recent
decision
of
this
court.
and
that
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case
since
that
case
did
not
deal
with
inherently
suspect
criterion
such
as
alienage.
in
fact,
there
the
argument
used
of
saving
a
welfare
cost
really
cuts
quite
far
because
it
can
justify
a
variety
of
discrimination,
invidious
discriminations
which
are
clearly
not
permissible
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
wish
to
further
suggest
that
the
--
well,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
distinguishing
fact
drawn
on
takahashi
that
earning
a
livelihood
really
is
not
a
distinguishing
factor
in
this
case.
both
takahashi
and
both
this
case
deal
with
access
to
necessities
of
life.
in
fact
there’s
a
stronger
argument
in
our
case
for
that
point
because
at
least
in
takahashi,
there
was
a
bar
to
one
aspect
of
employment
and
conceivably
those
fishermen
could
have
had
access
to
some
other
applications.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right,
i
think
crane
--
i
think
it
is
quite
weak
on
its
own
grounds.
i
think
the
underlying
doctrine,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
is
something
which
takahashi,
at
least
very
seriously
questioned
if
not
overruled.
and
if
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
itself
which
the
state
does
rely
upon
really
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
because
there’s
no
special
public
interest
in
tax
dollars
where
you
have
aliens
themselves
contributing
to
the
tax
dollars
to
that
resource.
and
that
whole
rationale
of
early
cases
of
somehow
a
property
interest
among
members
of
the
state
just
doesn’t
hold
when
those
members
of
the
state
or
aliens
have
contributed
to
that
source
of
resources.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
that
is
a
different
case
precisely
because
the
federal
government
has
plenary
powers
in
that
instance
of
regulating
expressed
powers
in
the
constitution
of
regulating
immigration
naturalization.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
the
constitution
would
grant
that
power
to
congress
if
congress
was
employing
their
immigration
and
naturalization
powers.
if
they
did
this
as
part
of
an
immigration
naturalization
scheme
so
they
could
justify
that
exercise
of
power.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
through
the
fifth
amendment
the
equal
protection
--
through
the
due
process
causes
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
is.
and
there
would
obviously
be
a
balancing
between
the
equal
protection
principles
through
the
due
process
clause
on
these
plenary
powers.
i
would
suggest
that
congress
could
probably
have
that
power
in
terms
of
that
balance
between
those
powers.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
did
state
that
that
congress
could
not
authorize
states
to
deny
equal
protection
to
a
class
discriminated
against
and
because
you
do
have
in
this
instance
expressed
immigration
powers
given
to
congress,
what
might
be
reasonable
and
constitutional
for
congress
to
do
may
not
be
or
constitutional
or
reasonable
for
states
to
do.
i
might
go
into
this
by
continuing
my
argument
that
the
same
scrutiny
which
the
equal
protection
clause
does
require
of
this
legislation
is
also
required
because
this
is
an
area
that
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government
and
as
heim
states
must
be
an
area
confined
to
the
narrowest
limits
to
a
state
regulation.
there
is
clear
conflict
with
federal
policy
and
law.
there’s
a
whole
scheme,
a
very
complex
scheme
of
federal
regulation
in
this
area
which
does
exclude
paupers
from
the
country
and
does
provide
for
deportation.
in
a
very
limited
case
where
the
person
becomes
a
public
charge
within
five
years
from
reasons
which
predated
entry
but
there
is
also
like
a
humane
aspect
to
that
provision
of
the
law
that
once
you
are
legally
admitted
in
this
country
you
can’t
--
and
you
have
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
in
any
state.
you
have
a
right
to
live
under
all
equal
privileges
of
citizens
under
non-discriminatory
laws.
the
pennsylvania
is
acting
in
this
case
irrespective
of
whether
the
person’s
been
here
for
five
years,
irrespective
of
what
the
cause
of
indigency
was.
in
addition,
the
effect
of
their
act,
as
was
stipulated
below,
the
effect
of
pennsylvania’s
act
is
to
discourage
continued
residence
in
pennsylvania
and
force
needy
resident
aliens
out
of
pennsylvania
into
other
states
that
would
be
hospitable
to
them
to
meet
their
needs.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
well
might
be
although,
the
record
doesn’t
suggest
that
fact.
the
record
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yeah!
there
may
well
be
some
aliens
who
might
think
that,
although
they
would
probably
be
people
who’d
be
excluded
because
the
federal
law
really
almost
insures
and
this
is
where
the
state’s
interest
is
really
insured
by
federal
law
that
those
admitted
into
the
country
will
be
productive
citizens.
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
secretary
of
labor
approval
for
the
jobs
they
had
so
there
is
a
very
real
screening
process
to
prevent
those
people
who
states
might
consider
a
burden
from
coming
into
the
united
states
but
this
aspect
of
segregating
poor
aliens
into
other
states
really
flies
in
the
face
of
our
concept
of
a
federal
union.
the
edwards
v.
california
case
established
that
interstate
migration
of
poor
people
is
an
aspect
of
national
concern
which
doesn’t
admit
of
diverse
treatment
of
the
states.
and
this
is
precisely
what
pennsylvania
is
doing
by
denying
resident
aliens
their
rights,
their
federal
privileges
of
entrance
and
abode
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no.
i
think
the
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
the
basis
of
giving
different
payments
is
based
upon
alienage.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
yes.
but
as
an
aspect
of
a
federally
conferred
privilege
under
truax
and
takahashi
which
state
clearly
that
the
alien
has
a
right
to
enter
and
abide,
to
live
among
the
community,
perhaps
among
these
ethnic
or
religious
fellows,
and
can’t
be
forced
out
of
the
state
as
what
is
happening
here
in
pennsylvania
where
it’s
clear,
it's
not
speculation.
it’s
stipulated
fact
below
that
poor
aliens
are
being
forced
out
of
the
state
as
a
result
of
this
requirement.
i
might
further
add
in
terms
conflict
with
federal
law,
i
think
a
number
of
the
civil
right
statutes
have
been
cited.
i
don’t
think
they
require
further
elaboration
at
this
point
but
there
are
other
conflicts
of
federal
law.
six
months
state
residence
is
a
requirement
of
naturalization
to
become
a
u.s.
citizen,
and
for
that
alien
who
is
forced
out
of
a
particular
state
and
who
wishes
to
become
naturalized,
that
six
months
period
of
naturalization
is
terminated
and
is
interrupted.
i
might
also
in
terms
of
embroiling
ourselves
with
other
nations,
both
panama
and
great
britain
grant
public
benefits
to
aliens,
to
u.s.
citizens
in
panama
and
great
britain.
and
if
either
of
these
states
were
to
retaliate
against
americans,
they
wouldn’t
be
retaliating
against
pennsylvanians
but
they're
retaliating
against
americans
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
i
believe
panama
gives
various
social
security
benefits
and
hospital
benefits
to
aliens
in
the
country.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
don’t
think
they
do.
great
britain
does
though
and
u.s.
citizens
in
great
britain
are
eligible
for
supplementary
benefits.
i’d
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
we
are
really
as
president
kennedy's
book
set
forth
a
nation
of
immigrants
with
a
proud
--
with
a
tradition
and
i
guess
our
strengths
of
our
history
reside
in
the
fact
that
when
immigrants
have
come
to
our
shores
and
to
live
among
us,
they
have
been
afforded
equal
treatment.
this
tradition
has
often
required
the
protection
and
vigilance
of
this
court
when
such
immigrants
have
been
met
with
ill
will
and
prejudice
when
they
have
come
to
this
shore
and
appellees
stand
before
this
court
today
seeking
this
protection
and
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
before
us
today,
a
case
of
alien
discrimination
which
is
rooted
in
the
prejudice
and
ill-will
of
an
early
year
in
pennsylvania.
the
fact
of
this
was
past
at
a
time
of
war
hysteria
and
anti-alien
feelings
in
pennsylvania
was
made
clear
in
a
memorandum
commission,
a
study
commissioned
by
the
state,
by
the
welfare
department
which
is
part
of
the
record.
in
addition,
this
law
which
was
passed
in
1939
was
passed
within
five
days
of
the
state's
alien
registration
act
which
this
court
struck
down
in
hines
v.
davidowitz
and
in
a
sense,
the
motivations
behind
a
citizenship
requirement
not
unlike
the
motivations
behind
the
residency
requirement
as
in
shapiro
v.
thompson,
both
basically
rest
in
a
basic
distrust
or
dislike
perhaps
a
fear
of
the
foreigner,
of
the
out
of
state
person.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
maybe
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
voting
area
and
this
political
public
office
area
is
very
much
distinguishable
from
this
area
before
the
court
today.
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
in
acting
to
protect
its
political
processes,
the
governmental
processes
and
they
just
--
and
they
don’t
have
that
latitude
in
the
area
which
is
before
us
today
of
social
or
economic
benefits
which
are
based
upon
a
classification
on
alienage.
that’s
the
teaching
of
takahashi
which
says
that
a
state
is
very
much
limited
in
making
a
classification
based
on
alienage.
i
might
point
out
in
response
to
the
commonwealth’s
argument
that
takahashi
wasn’t
an
alienage
case,
that
the
provision
of
the
state
law
based
upon
a
federal
citizenship
requirement
did
not
mention
any
racial
exclusion.
and
footnotes
both
in
takahashi
and
oyama
point
to
japanese
and
other
groups
which
were
affected
by
that
provision.
more
over
this
court
had
an
opportunity
in
takahashi
to
view
this
as
a
racial
case,
as
an
anti-japanese
case.
and
in
fact,
this
option
is
made
clear
by
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
murphy
who
perhaps
would
have
preferred
to
view
it
as
an
anti-japanese
case,
but
that’s
not
the
way
the
majority
of
the
court
view
the
case.
the
majority
of
the
court
viewed
the
case
and
equated
alienage
with
color
as
both
being
impermissible
basis
for
classification
both
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
both
under
the
civil
rights
act.
i
might
add
that
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
add
your
honor
that
it
is
in
conflict
both
of
the
equal
protection
argument
and
those
statutes
that
put
that
clause
in
effect
like
section
1981,
like
the
section
2000
(d)
in
42
u.s.c.
which
promulgate
that
principle
of
equality
between
citizens
and
aliens.
we
have
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
or
aliens,
permanent
resident
aliens
of
pennsylvania
who
have
had
a
history
of
productive
and
sustained
work
before
becoming
ill
and
requiring
public
assistance.
the
classification
established
is
one
between
two
indistinguishable
classes,
needy
residents
of
pennsylvania
on
the
one
hand
who
are
citizens,
needy
residents
of
the
state
who
are
not
u.s.
citizens,
and
we
maintain
that
on
either
of
the
two
equal
protection
tests,
this
classification
must
fall
either
on
the
basis
that
there
is
simply
no
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
permissible
legislative
purpose
or
on
--
perhaps
an
equally
applicable
test
that
the
state
must
meet
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
in
validating
and
justifying
this
discrimination.
the
latter
test
we
suggest
is
applicable
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
suspect
criteria.
suspect
because
history
has
shown
that
when
this
criterion
is
used
to
basic
classification,
it’s
often
been
amassed
where
simply
a
rational
prejudice
against
that
particular
group.
i
might
add
in
addition,
we’re
dealing
with
a
group
which
is
a
(inaudible)
minority,
disenfranchised
and
which
is
politically
defenseless
and
can’t
rely
upon
the
political
processes
for
redress
of
grievances.
this
is
an
additional
reason
why
we
suggest
that
a
special
scrutiny
test
is
applicable.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
we
suggest
your
honor
that
that
realm
of
political
activity
and
that
realm
of
holding
public
office
and
voting
does
involve
the
government’s
attempt
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
processes.
perhaps
there
is
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
perhaps
a
concern
about
loyalty
to
another
country.
it
may
well
be
that
that
may
not
be
that
rational
a
basis.
this
court
in
oyama,
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
where
mr.
justice
murphy
and
rutledge
suggested
that
assuming
a
priority,
the
disloyalty
of
aliens
cannot
be
done.
but
we’re
just
suggesting
now
that
because
the
scenario
of
political
concern
involving
the
integrity
of
the
political
processes,
the
government
has
much
wider
latitude
to
legislate,
to
regulate
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
not
necessarily,
there
are
certain
exigencies
as
certain
wartime
concerns
where
national
security
which
may
be
not
unrelated
to
voting
and
holding
public
office.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
that’s
right.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yes,
but
voting
can
involve
questions
of
national
security
of
political
questions
which
the
government,
in
our
view
has
much
wider
latitude
in
regulating
than
than
they
do
in
the
fishing
license,
welfare
benefit
scheme.
what
is
really,
i
think
at
issue
here
in
terms
of
what
the
basis
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
really
an
assumption
that
the
aliens
are
less
deserving
than
citizens
and
it
has
been
judicially
recognized
both
by
the
court
below,
both
by
the
purdy
&
fitzpatrick
california
supreme
court
opinion
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
oyama
that
aliens
have
contributed
their
energies
and
the
tax
dollars
to
this
country.
they
have
often
been
long
domiciled
in
this
country
with
the
history,
work
history,
a
productive
history
of
contributing
to
the
states
of
the
nation.
they
have
established
families
and
reared
children.
they
have
entered
into
this
social
and
religious
fabric
of
this
nation.
and
of
course
they
have
obligations
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
think
one
could
and
that’s
why
i
would
only
suggest
that
the
two
areas
are
distinguishable
but
it
may
well
be
that
for
certain
voting
rights
as
my
colleague
from
arizona,
mr.
ching
suggested
that
voting
privileges
maybe
those
privileges
which
are
and
should
be
extended
to
aliens.
i’m
not
closing
my
mind
to
that,
you
know,
to
that
point.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
definitive
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
my
answer
today
is
that
there
--
since
there
is
wide
latitude
for
state
government
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
political
concerns
that
right
now
aliens
do
not
have
that
right
to
vote
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
fact
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
your
honor,
in
fact
they
do
in
terms
of
how
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
interpreted
in
its
application
to
aliens.
this
case
in
one
sense
presents
a
stronger
factual
pattern
and
does
the
shapiro
v.
thompson
residency
case.
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
classification.
in
the
residency
case,
you
had
newcomers
to
the
state,
people
living
in
the
state
less
than
one
year.
in
our
case,
we
have
people
who
have
been
in
the
state
for
many
years
who
have
clearly
made
a
contribution
to
the
state
and
to
the
nation.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no
your
honor.
in
many
cases
as
the
record
shows,
many
resident
aliens
cannot
become
naturalized
simply
because
they
can’t
pass
the
literacy
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
that
is
a
choice
of
volition,
a
question
of
volition,
i
would
say
that
for
people,
at
least
literacy
is
not
always
for
everyone
a
voluntary
act.
i
mean
there
are
people
who
haven’t
been
literate
and
can
speak
english
so
they
maybe
quite
literate
in
russian
or
spanish
due
to
no
fault
of
their
own.
and
so
that
that
aspect
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
think
that’s
really
an
irrelevant
concern
because
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens
irrespective
of
their
desire
to
become
naturalized,
irrespective
of
their
literacy
qualifications.
the
pennsylvania
in
a
census
is
saying
that
they're
trying
to
save
money
for
their
own
people.
but
through
this
citizenship
bar,
they
are
in
fact
denying
assistance
to
their
own
people,
to
residents
of
pennsylvania.
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
to
these
classifications.
this
conservation
of
funds
argument,
we
maintain
also
comes
down
to
really
to
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
what
has
amounted
to
a
casual
and
quite
pointless
discrimination.
the
court
below
questioned
the
physical
concern
when
i
pointed
out
that
but
65
or
70
people
each
year
are
denied
general
assistance
in
pennsylvania,
in
a
state
where
there
are
over
700,000
people
on
assistance.
in
addition,
pennsylvania
although
they’re
saving
money
for
u.s.
citizens
and
denying
it
to
aliens
or
giving
money
to
aliens
in
the
federal
categories.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
it
doesn’t
your
honor.
it
only
makes
a
difference
as
to
the
state’s
argument
in
suggesting
a
rational
basis
in
a
physical
concern.
the
court
below
said
where
is
the
physical
concern
really
when
merely
65
or
70
people
are
at
issue.
but
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
mean
to
say
its
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right.
it
is
not
relevant
in
the
abstracts
of
the
constitutional
issue
but
in
this
case
where
the
sole
basis
for
justification
resides
in
conserving
of
state
funds.
one
has
to
scrutinize
that
state
interest
and
see
it
for
what
it
is
which
is
we
suggest
a
fiction
in
this
case,
because
there’s
really
no
physical
concern
here.
this
was
an
argument
which
is
a
post
hoc
rationalization
for
a
discrimination
made
30
odd
years
ago
when
prejudice
ill-will
against
aliens
was
really
the
motivation
for
this
statute.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
your
honor,
the
clear
holding
of
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
established
that
the
saving
of
welfare
cost
if
that’s
what
the
state
is
concerned
in
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
i
can’t
--
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
numbers
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
state
can
base
a
classification
upon
alienage,
whether
there
are
60,
whether
there
are
600
or
longer.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
pardon?
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
fundamental
freedom
there
of
interstate
travel
which
established
the
basis
for
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
we
are
suggesting
in
this
case
that
the
inherently
suspect
criterion
of
alienage
would
justify
applications
of
that
test.
but
even
if
one
doesn’t
apply
that
test,
using
the
traditional
test
of
a
rational
relationship
to
a
constitutionally
acceptable
legislative
purpose,
this
law
fails.
in
fact,
shapiro
itself
suggested
that
the
residency
requirement
would
seem
to
fail
even
on
the
test
of
the
rational
relationship
test.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
would
not
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
receive
welfare
in
panama
or
great
britain
as
the
two
named
plaintiffs
here.
residents
in
the
state
without
being
a
durational
residency
requirement
would
be
a
valid
requirement
because
that
cuts
equally
for
u.s.
citizens
or
aliens
and
so
that,
you
know,
the
fact
that
that
a
state
can
--
we
maintain
a
state
could
and
could
validly
set
residence
in
the
state
as
a
bona
fide
constitutional
requirement
for
receiving
assistance.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
if
they
are
in
the
state,
they
would
be
illegible
like
other
u.s.
citizens
in
pennsylvania
to
receive
assistance.
they
couldn’t
go
some
place
else
and
ask
for
benefits
when
they’re
not
residing
in
pennsylvania.
the
commonwealth
does
give
much
leeway
or
support
on
williams
v.
dandridge,
dandridge
v.
williams,
a
recent
decision
of
this
court.
and
that
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case
since
that
case
did
not
deal
with
inherently
suspect
criterion
such
as
alienage.
in
fact,
there
the
argument
used
of
saving
a
welfare
cost
really
cuts
quite
far
because
it
can
justify
a
variety
of
discrimination,
invidious
discriminations
which
are
clearly
not
permissible
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
wish
to
further
suggest
that
the
--
well,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
distinguishing
fact
drawn
on
takahashi
that
earning
a
livelihood
really
is
not
a
distinguishing
factor
in
this
case.
both
takahashi
and
both
this
case
deal
with
access
to
necessities
of
life.
in
fact
there’s
a
stronger
argument
in
our
case
for
that
point
because
at
least
in
takahashi,
there
was
a
bar
to
one
aspect
of
employment
and
conceivably
those
fishermen
could
have
had
access
to
some
other
applications.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
right,
i
think
crane
--
i
think
it
is
quite
weak
on
its
own
grounds.
i
think
the
underlying
doctrine,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
is
something
which
takahashi,
at
least
very
seriously
questioned
if
not
overruled.
and
if
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
itself
which
the
state
does
rely
upon
really
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
because
there’s
no
special
public
interest
in
tax
dollars
where
you
have
aliens
themselves
contributing
to
the
tax
dollars
to
that
resource.
and
that
whole
rationale
of
early
cases
of
somehow
a
property
interest
among
members
of
the
state
just
doesn’t
hold
when
those
members
of
the
state
or
aliens
have
contributed
to
that
source
of
resources.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
that
is
a
different
case
precisely
because
the
federal
government
has
plenary
powers
in
that
instance
of
regulating
expressed
powers
in
the
constitution
of
regulating
immigration
naturalization.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
the
constitution
would
grant
that
power
to
congress
if
congress
was
employing
their
immigration
and
naturalization
powers.
if
they
did
this
as
part
of
an
immigration
naturalization
scheme
so
they
could
justify
that
exercise
of
power.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
through
the
fifth
amendment
the
equal
protection
--
through
the
due
process
causes
of
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
is.
and
there
would
obviously
be
a
balancing
between
the
equal
protection
principles
through
the
due
process
clause
on
these
plenary
powers.
i
would
suggest
that
congress
could
probably
have
that
power
in
terms
of
that
balance
between
those
powers.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
did
state
that
that
congress
could
not
authorize
states
to
deny
equal
protection
to
a
class
discriminated
against
and
because
you
do
have
in
this
instance
expressed
immigration
powers
given
to
congress,
what
might
be
reasonable
and
constitutional
for
congress
to
do
may
not
be
or
constitutional
or
reasonable
for
states
to
do.
i
might
go
into
this
by
continuing
my
argument
that
the
same
scrutiny
which
the
equal
protection
clause
does
require
of
this
legislation
is
also
required
because
this
is
an
area
that
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government
and
as
heim
states
must
be
an
area
confined
to
the
narrowest
limits
to
a
state
regulation.
there
is
clear
conflict
with
federal
policy
and
law.
there’s
a
whole
scheme,
a
very
complex
scheme
of
federal
regulation
in
this
area
which
does
exclude
paupers
from
the
country
and
does
provide
for
deportation.
in
a
very
limited
case
where
the
person
becomes
a
public
charge
within
five
years
from
reasons
which
predated
entry
but
there
is
also
like
a
humane
aspect
to
that
provision
of
the
law
that
once
you
are
legally
admitted
in
this
country
you
can’t
--
and
you
have
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
in
any
state.
you
have
a
right
to
live
under
all
equal
privileges
of
citizens
under
non-discriminatory
laws.
the
pennsylvania
is
acting
in
this
case
irrespective
of
whether
the
person’s
been
here
for
five
years,
irrespective
of
what
the
cause
of
indigency
was.
in
addition,
the
effect
of
their
act,
as
was
stipulated
below,
the
effect
of
pennsylvania’s
act
is
to
discourage
continued
residence
in
pennsylvania
and
force
needy
resident
aliens
out
of
pennsylvania
into
other
states
that
would
be
hospitable
to
them
to
meet
their
needs.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
it
well
might
be
although,
the
record
doesn’t
suggest
that
fact.
the
record
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
yeah!
there
may
well
be
some
aliens
who
might
think
that,
although
they
would
probably
be
people
who’d
be
excluded
because
the
federal
law
really
almost
insures
and
this
is
where
the
state’s
interest
is
really
insured
by
federal
law
that
those
admitted
into
the
country
will
be
productive
citizens.
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
secretary
of
labor
approval
for
the
jobs
they
had
so
there
is
a
very
real
screening
process
to
prevent
those
people
who
states
might
consider
a
burden
from
coming
into
the
united
states
but
this
aspect
of
segregating
poor
aliens
into
other
states
really
flies
in
the
face
of
our
concept
of
a
federal
union.
the
edwards
v.
california
case
established
that
interstate
migration
of
poor
people
is
an
aspect
of
national
concern
which
doesn’t
admit
of
diverse
treatment
of
the
states.
and
this
is
precisely
what
pennsylvania
is
doing
by
denying
resident
aliens
their
rights,
their
federal
privileges
of
entrance
and
abode
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
no.
i
think
the
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well,
if
the
basis
of
giving
different
payments
is
based
upon
alienage.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
yes.
but
as
an
aspect
of
a
federally
conferred
privilege
under
truax
and
takahashi
which
state
clearly
that
the
alien
has
a
right
to
enter
and
abide,
to
live
among
the
community,
perhaps
among
these
ethnic
or
religious
fellows,
and
can’t
be
forced
out
of
the
state
as
what
is
happening
here
in
pennsylvania
where
it’s
clear,
it's
not
speculation.
it’s
stipulated
fact
below
that
poor
aliens
are
being
forced
out
of
the
state
as
a
result
of
this
requirement.
i
might
further
add
in
terms
conflict
with
federal
law,
i
think
a
number
of
the
civil
right
statutes
have
been
cited.
i
don’t
think
they
require
further
elaboration
at
this
point
but
there
are
other
conflicts
of
federal
law.
six
months
state
residence
is
a
requirement
of
naturalization
to
become
a
u.s.
citizen,
and
for
that
alien
who
is
forced
out
of
a
particular
state
and
who
wishes
to
become
naturalized,
that
six
months
period
of
naturalization
is
terminated
and
is
interrupted.
i
might
also
in
terms
of
embroiling
ourselves
with
other
nations,
both
panama
and
great
britain
grant
public
benefits
to
aliens,
to
u.s.
citizens
in
panama
and
great
britain.
and
if
either
of
these
states
were
to
retaliate
against
americans,
they
wouldn’t
be
retaliating
against
pennsylvanians
but
they're
retaliating
against
americans
--
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
well
i
believe
panama
gives
various
social
security
benefits
and
hospital
benefits
to
aliens
in
the
country.
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein
i
don’t
think
they
do.
great
britain
does
though
and
u.s.
citizens
in
great
britain
are
eligible
for
supplementary
benefits.
i’d
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
we
are
really
as
president
kennedy's
book
set
forth
a
nation
of
immigrants
with
a
proud
--
with
a
tradition
and
i
guess
our
strengths
of
our
history
reside
in
the
fact
that
when
immigrants
have
come
to
our
shores
and
to
live
among
us,
they
have
been
afforded
equal
treatment.
this
tradition
has
often
required
the
protection
and
vigilance
of
this
court
when
such
immigrants
have
been
met
with
ill
will
and
prejudice
when
they
have
come
to
this
shore
and
appellees
stand
before
this
court
today
seeking
this
protection
and
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
