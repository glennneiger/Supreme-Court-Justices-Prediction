mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
this
time
reply
very
briefly
to
the
reply
brief
submitted
by
the
appellant.
the
appellant
apparently
found
that
one
of
the
argument
raised
in
the
appellee’s
brief,
the
argument
that
the
state
law
here
conflicts
with
the
treaties
made
by
united
states,
namely
the
u.n.
charter
and
the
charter
of
the
oas.
since
that
argument
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below,
we
should
not
raise
it
here.
in
reply
to
that
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
is
a
general
appellate
rule
that
any
decision
by
a
lower
court
should
be
affirmed
if
there’s
any
basis
or
ground
to
affirm
that
decision
even
if
the
affirming
of
the
case
would
rely
on
grounds
not
otherwise
raised
in
a
court
below.
this
is
different
than
appellant’s
position
which
is
--
you
can
reverse
a
case
on
a
basis
of
a
ground
which
has
not
been
established
below.
in
other
words,
the
lower
court
had
no
opportunity
to
review
that
claim
and
somehow
the
result
would
have
been
different.
and
to
support
my
theory,
there
are
two
cases
decided
by
this
court,
very
squarely
in
point.
these
cases
are
helvering
versus
gowran
in
302
u.s.
238
and
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery
corporation
318
u.s.
80.
the
appellees’
brief
raised
four
different
grounds
for
the
affirmance
of
a
decision
below.
i
would
discuss
each
of
them
in
this
argument.
the
first
basis
for
affirming
the
decision
is
that
the
united
states
government
has
on
several
occasions
entered
into
multilateral
treaties
with
other
nations
and
particularly,
the
united
nations
charter
which
governs
this
country,
the
same
as
any
other
treaty.
this
was
the
view
that
was
advanced
in
an
earlier
case
argued
before
this
court
in
rice
versus
sioux
city,
cemetery
case
cited
in
my
brief
and
the
court
on
rehearing
has
said
that
that
argument
was
not
without
merit.
we
know
that
the
united
states
is
a
leader
of
the
free
world
and
that
everything
that
we
do
reflect
very
seriously
on
our
posture
broad.
specifically,
if
the
states
are
allowed
to
discriminate
against
aliens,
nationals
of
other
countries
who
are
invited
to
come
to
this
country
and
there
are
immigration
powers,
it
will
weaken
our
posture
before
the
other
nations.
and
for
this
reason,
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
conflict
with
the
national
interest
and
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states
government.
and
more
particularly,
since
it
is
established
that
most
of
the
aliens
in
arizona
are
aliens
of
mexican
origin,
we
are
bound
by
the
treaty
called
the
charter
of
the
organization
of
american
states
and
the
oas
charter
as
cited
in
my
brief,
very
specifically
provided
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
within
the
respective
jurisdictions.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
as
for
the
alien's
right
to
vote
is
concerned,
it
raises
two
different
issues
which
is
near
them
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
however,
if
the
court
wishes
i
will
very
briefly
discuss
that.
first
of
all,
as
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
aware
of
that,
however
in
oyama
v.
california
again
cited
before
this
court
and
decided
by
this
court,
four
of
the
justice
of
this
court
felt
that
the
united
nation
charter
has
some
relevancy
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
justice
white,
i
didn't
quite
follow
your
question.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
if
they
reside
within
the
jurisdictional
boundary
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
for
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
believe
this
is
an
area
which
is
reserved
to
the
countries
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly,
plus
a
federal
deportation
is
a
question
of
congressional
powers.
we’re
dealing
here
with
states
who
attempt
to
exercise
powers
that
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
powers
and
the
federal
policy
as
established
by
treaties
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
raises
a
host
of
other
problems
which
i’m
not
prepared
this
time
to
go
into
it
whether
or
not
alien
has
standing
to
raise
congressional
statutes
which
maybe
unconstitutional.
i
will
now
argue
the
equal
protection
argument
which
i
believe
is
our
chief
argument
and
which
is
the
argument
sustained
by
the
court
below
in
rendering
the
favorable
decision.
although
the
argument
was
listed
last
in
my
brief.
there
was
no
question
in
my
mind
that
based
on
previous
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens.
the
only
argument
that
is
raised
by
mr.
flam
is
that
for
some
reason
the
states
can
discriminate
against
aliens,
if
they
have
a
so-called
special
public
interest.
i
do
not
believe
that
mr.
flam
had
re-articulated
what
that
interest
is,
other
than
the
saving
of
money.
we
do
have
a
classification
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
there
are
two
classes,
a
and
b;
a
would
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
residing
in
arizona,
and
b
will
be
the
resident
aliens
in
arizona.
and
under
b,
there
are
two
subclasses.
first,
those
aliens
who
have
lived
in
arizona
for
15
years
or
more,
who
have
lived
in
united
states
for
15
years
or
more
and,
two,
those
who
have
not
lived
in
the
united
states
for
15
years.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
because
it
still
discriminates
against
the
alien
residents
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
unless
the
state
can
show
that
the
six-month
period
is
necessary
for
them
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
an
alien.
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
why
is
it
that
it
would
take
less
time
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
a
citizen.
as
i
see
it,
to
determine
eligibility
is
something
which
you
have
to
do
for
both
alien
and
citizens
alike.
and
certainly,
there’s
a
period
of
time
for
the
application
to
be
processed
and
to
conduct
proper
investigation
as
to
eligibility.
but
there’s
no
reason
to
require
a
longer
period
for
that
purpose
for
aliens.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
social
security
act
as
argued
by
mr.
flam
is
not
expressly
in
point.
it
permits
the
states
under
the
interpretation
placed
by
hew
in
the
handbook
provision
for
the
states
to
enact
requirements
of
residency
or
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
or
to
deny
aliens
from
any
benefits
entirely.
the
statute
is
not
a
mandatory
one
and
that
the
statute
merely
permits
them
to
so
discriminate.
i
would
submit
that
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
merely
permissive
and
secondly
congress
can
no
more
authorize
the
states
to
violate
equal
protection,
then
the
states
can
violate
equal
protection.
this
is
a
precise
language
used
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
this
issue
was
before
this
court
as
to
durational
residency
requirement
for
all
persons
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
the
congressional
act
provided
the
states
may
enact
duration
of
residency
requirement.
and
this
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
act.
the
argument
on
the
other
side
of
course,
will
be
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
immigration
and
if
congress
exercised
that
power
and
expressly
provided
that
as
part
of
the
immigration
scheme
that
aliens
should
not
get
welfare
and
if
the
congressional
history
adequately
established
that
and
if
it
has
been
through
an
overall
scheme
to
regulate
immigration,
then
that
maybe
supportable
to
the
extent
of
our
argument
as
to
the
preemption
aspect
of
federal
law
over
state
law.
however,
that
is
not
supportable
in
our
equal
protection
argument.
i
would
go
on
now
to
the
interest
affected.
the
interest
affected
by
the
operation
of
the
arizona
act,
is
a
very,
very
serious
interest.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
observed
earlier,
these
people
may
well
starve.
these
are
people
who
came
to
this
country
by
permission
of
the
federal
government
or
invitation,
these
people
came
here
and
for
some
reason
they
became
destitute.
and
the
public
systems
such
as
old-age
or
the
aid
to
the
disabled
as
sought
by
the
appellee
here
is
something
to
barely
keep
the
person
going.
the
interest
is
vital.
as
compared
to
the
interest
of
the
state,
the
interest
of
the
individual
must
prevail.
the
argument
that
the
state
is
trying
to
save
part
of
a
sinking
ship
is
not
very
convincing
to
me.
we
all
know
that
if
you’re
on
a
sinking
ship
and
you
may
have
to
throw
someone
overboard,
in
order
to
keep
the
ship
afloat.
now,
the
question
is
who
we
should
throw
overboard?
the
state’s
argument
say
we
can
throw
the
alien
overboard
because
this
court
had
allowed
the
states
to
do
so.
i
don’t
think
that
the
privacy
of
the
state
of
this
court
has
really
authorized
the
state
to
do
that
and
i
think
to
throw
aliens
overboard
without
more
is
unconstitutional
to
say
the
least,
that
there
is
a
greater
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
government
or
the
federal
government
based
on
humanitarian
interest
to
see
if
we
can
save
and
protect
every
person.
even
though
if
everybody
may
get
by
with
little
less.
to
arbitrarily
--
to
use
the
phrase,
“selfishness
to
just
preserve
one’s
immediate
family
and
throw
other
people
to
the
wolves”
is
not
a
type
of
doctrine
that
will
survive
today
when
the
existence
of
mankind
depends
on
the
cooperation
of
everybody
and
out
of
self-interest
to
protect
one's
immediate
surrounding
members.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
aliens
have
just
by
all
the
obligations
i
can
think
of
being
an
alien
myself
at
one
time.
i
would
say
that
the
aliens
pay
all
taxes;
property
tax,
income
tax,
sales
tax.
the
aliens
are
subject
to
the
draft,
the
military
service.
they
are
allowed
to
work
and
from
their
work,
they
pay
taxes.
i
cannot
think
of
any
obligation
that
the
aliens
are
exempted
from.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
unless
you
view
upon
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote
as
an
obligation
rather
than
a
right
and
the
aliens
do
not
vote.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i
believe
again
this
is
not
before
this
court,
i
believe
that
as
elections
are
purely
local
in
nature
which
affects
a
direct
interest
of
an
alien,
for
example,
a
bond
issue
which
will
affect
his
property
tax
and
if
that
alien
could
not
become
a
u.s.
citizen
solely
because
of
the
language
requirement,
i
will
say
to
deny
that
that
person’s
right
to
vote
may
well
be
unconstitutional.
as
to
election
for
national
offices
or
the
national
government,
where
the
aliens’
loyalty
to
another
country
may
color
his
vote,
i
would
say
that
can
be
sustained.
their
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
but
that
is
not
before
this
court
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
i’m
saying
that
depending
on
the
interest
affected.
in
other
words,
if
the
election
is
on
the
question
whether
or
not
your
taxes
on
your
home
will
be
increased
to
pay
for
new
schools
and
an
alien
owner
of
a
home
cannot
vote
and
yet
he’s
subject
to
the
tax,
i
would
say
that
denial
for
the
alien
to
vote
in
that
case,
assuming
that
he
had
not
become
a
citizen
within
the
requisite
time
due
to
other
considerations,
i
would
say
that
denial
may
well
be
unconstitutional
but
this
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
the
statute
as
cited
in
my
brief
provided
for
deportation
as
it
causes
arising
before
they
come
and
not
as
it
causes
after
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
nationalization
and
immigration
if
that
is
made
part
of
the
scheme
to
legislate
in
this
area.
whether
that
type
of
legislation
as
to
aliens
who
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
visa
become
residents
in
the
united
states,
whether
or
not
that
provision
violates
equal
protection.
it’s
something
that
i
cannot
even
speculate
at
this
time.
this
court
will
have
to
take
it
up
on
another
occasion.
that
will
be
the
question
between
one
power
of
congress
versus
another
power
or
where
this
is
a
same
situation
whether
or
not
that
provision
will
violate
the
treaties.
maybe
the
forum
to
raise
will
be
something
international
tribunal,
i
don’t
know
but
this
has
been
speculated
by
people
who
are
writing
legal
treatises
but
i
cannot
really
give
all
the
answers
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
think
the
issue
is
where
you
draw
the
line
as
to
where
the
direct
interest
disappears
and
the
interest
will
be
indirect
and
the
decision
of
this
court
has
always
been
trying
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i’m
just
responding
to
questions
from
the
bench
and
perhaps
i
am
being
too
loquacious
in
discussing
constitutional
law.
i
would
--[laughter]
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
enjoy
--
being
from
an
academic
community,
i
enjoy
talking
about
extract
principles.
i
understand
and
i
must
emphasize
that
my
answers
to
these
questions
has
no
bearing
to
this
particular
case
because
we’re
dealing
with
the
state
statute.
we
are
arguing
that
a
state
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
and
that
prior
decision
of
this
court
such
as
truax
v.
raich,
yick
wo,
and
the
latest
case
of
this
court
in
takahashi
v.
california
fish
and
game
commission
very
clearly
show
that
the
states
can
no
longer
deny
aliens
some
of
the
basic
necessities
of
life
such
as
employment,
on
this
case,
welfare
benefits.
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
flam,
the
case
of
heim
v.
mccall
which
came
out
the
same
year,
as
truax
v.
raich,
and
also
people
versus
crane,
these
are
cases
decided
in
another
day
and
age
based
on
the
right
of
privilege
to
the
economy
and
i
do
not
believe
that
these
cases
should
be
used
as
authority
for
this
court
today
and
that
these
case
should
be
overruled.
further,
we
have
additional
arguments
including
that
of
the
preemption
argument
that
since
the
federal
government
had
provided
for
immigration
nationalization
under
the
foreign
commerce
power
and
under
the
power
to
regulate
immigration
and
nationalization.
the
states
can
no
more
enter
the
area
because
it
conflicts
with
the
national
power
and
the
supremacy
clause.
here
we
got
several
cases
by
this
court,
fong
yue
ting
case
and
the
case
of
hines
versus
davidowitz
are
in
point.
further,
we
have
congressional
statutes
in
point
governing
the
equal
protection
of
laws
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1870
which
is
now
in
42
u.s.c
1981
and
that
statute
was
cited
with
approval
in
both
truax
v.
raich
and
the
takahashi
case
as
providing
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
including
aliens.
but
that
statute
is
very
specific
and
say
that,
“all
persons
within
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
must
be
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
the
full
and
equal
benefits
of
all
laws.”
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
civil
rights
of
1964
in
42
u.s.c.
2000d.
so,
it's
our
position
that
the
decision
in
the
lower
court
can
be
sustained
on
any
and
all
grounds
raised
by
our
brief
and
that
there
are
cases
squarely
in
point
--
from
precedents
decided
by
this
court
and
that
therefore
we
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
rendered
by
the
court
below.
are
there
any
more
questions?
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
this
time
reply
very
briefly
to
the
reply
brief
submitted
by
the
appellant.
the
appellant
apparently
found
that
one
of
the
argument
raised
in
the
appellee’s
brief,
the
argument
that
the
state
law
here
conflicts
with
the
treaties
made
by
united
states,
namely
the
u.n.
charter
and
the
charter
of
the
oas.
since
that
argument
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below,
we
should
not
raise
it
here.
in
reply
to
that
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
is
a
general
appellate
rule
that
any
decision
by
a
lower
court
should
be
affirmed
if
there’s
any
basis
or
ground
to
affirm
that
decision
even
if
the
affirming
of
the
case
would
rely
on
grounds
not
otherwise
raised
in
a
court
below.
this
is
different
than
appellant’s
position
which
is
--
you
can
reverse
a
case
on
a
basis
of
a
ground
which
has
not
been
established
below.
in
other
words,
the
lower
court
had
no
opportunity
to
review
that
claim
and
somehow
the
result
would
have
been
different.
and
to
support
my
theory,
there
are
two
cases
decided
by
this
court,
very
squarely
in
point.
these
cases
are
helvering
versus
gowran
in
302
u.s.
238
and
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery
corporation
318
u.s.
80.
the
appellees’
brief
raised
four
different
grounds
for
the
affirmance
of
a
decision
below.
i
would
discuss
each
of
them
in
this
argument.
the
first
basis
for
affirming
the
decision
is
that
the
united
states
government
has
on
several
occasions
entered
into
multilateral
treaties
with
other
nations
and
particularly,
the
united
nations
charter
which
governs
this
country,
the
same
as
any
other
treaty.
this
was
the
view
that
was
advanced
in
an
earlier
case
argued
before
this
court
in
rice
versus
sioux
city,
cemetery
case
cited
in
my
brief
and
the
court
on
rehearing
has
said
that
that
argument
was
not
without
merit.
we
know
that
the
united
states
is
a
leader
of
the
free
world
and
that
everything
that
we
do
reflect
very
seriously
on
our
posture
broad.
specifically,
if
the
states
are
allowed
to
discriminate
against
aliens,
nationals
of
other
countries
who
are
invited
to
come
to
this
country
and
there
are
immigration
powers,
it
will
weaken
our
posture
before
the
other
nations.
and
for
this
reason,
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
conflict
with
the
national
interest
and
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states
government.
and
more
particularly,
since
it
is
established
that
most
of
the
aliens
in
arizona
are
aliens
of
mexican
origin,
we
are
bound
by
the
treaty
called
the
charter
of
the
organization
of
american
states
and
the
oas
charter
as
cited
in
my
brief,
very
specifically
provided
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
within
the
respective
jurisdictions.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
as
for
the
alien's
right
to
vote
is
concerned,
it
raises
two
different
issues
which
is
near
them
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
however,
if
the
court
wishes
i
will
very
briefly
discuss
that.
first
of
all,
as
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
aware
of
that,
however
in
oyama
v.
california
again
cited
before
this
court
and
decided
by
this
court,
four
of
the
justice
of
this
court
felt
that
the
united
nation
charter
has
some
relevancy
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
justice
white,
i
didn't
quite
follow
your
question.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
if
they
reside
within
the
jurisdictional
boundary
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
for
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
believe
this
is
an
area
which
is
reserved
to
the
countries
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly,
plus
a
federal
deportation
is
a
question
of
congressional
powers.
we’re
dealing
here
with
states
who
attempt
to
exercise
powers
that
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
powers
and
the
federal
policy
as
established
by
treaties
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
raises
a
host
of
other
problems
which
i’m
not
prepared
this
time
to
go
into
it
whether
or
not
alien
has
standing
to
raise
congressional
statutes
which
maybe
unconstitutional.
i
will
now
argue
the
equal
protection
argument
which
i
believe
is
our
chief
argument
and
which
is
the
argument
sustained
by
the
court
below
in
rendering
the
favorable
decision.
although
the
argument
was
listed
last
in
my
brief.
there
was
no
question
in
my
mind
that
based
on
previous
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens.
the
only
argument
that
is
raised
by
mr.
flam
is
that
for
some
reason
the
states
can
discriminate
against
aliens,
if
they
have
a
so-called
special
public
interest.
i
do
not
believe
that
mr.
flam
had
re-articulated
what
that
interest
is,
other
than
the
saving
of
money.
we
do
have
a
classification
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
there
are
two
classes,
a
and
b;
a
would
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
residing
in
arizona,
and
b
will
be
the
resident
aliens
in
arizona.
and
under
b,
there
are
two
subclasses.
first,
those
aliens
who
have
lived
in
arizona
for
15
years
or
more,
who
have
lived
in
united
states
for
15
years
or
more
and,
two,
those
who
have
not
lived
in
the
united
states
for
15
years.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
because
it
still
discriminates
against
the
alien
residents
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
unless
the
state
can
show
that
the
six-month
period
is
necessary
for
them
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
an
alien.
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
why
is
it
that
it
would
take
less
time
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
a
citizen.
as
i
see
it,
to
determine
eligibility
is
something
which
you
have
to
do
for
both
alien
and
citizens
alike.
and
certainly,
there’s
a
period
of
time
for
the
application
to
be
processed
and
to
conduct
proper
investigation
as
to
eligibility.
but
there’s
no
reason
to
require
a
longer
period
for
that
purpose
for
aliens.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
social
security
act
as
argued
by
mr.
flam
is
not
expressly
in
point.
it
permits
the
states
under
the
interpretation
placed
by
hew
in
the
handbook
provision
for
the
states
to
enact
requirements
of
residency
or
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
or
to
deny
aliens
from
any
benefits
entirely.
the
statute
is
not
a
mandatory
one
and
that
the
statute
merely
permits
them
to
so
discriminate.
i
would
submit
that
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
merely
permissive
and
secondly
congress
can
no
more
authorize
the
states
to
violate
equal
protection,
then
the
states
can
violate
equal
protection.
this
is
a
precise
language
used
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
this
issue
was
before
this
court
as
to
durational
residency
requirement
for
all
persons
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
the
congressional
act
provided
the
states
may
enact
duration
of
residency
requirement.
and
this
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
act.
the
argument
on
the
other
side
of
course,
will
be
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
immigration
and
if
congress
exercised
that
power
and
expressly
provided
that
as
part
of
the
immigration
scheme
that
aliens
should
not
get
welfare
and
if
the
congressional
history
adequately
established
that
and
if
it
has
been
through
an
overall
scheme
to
regulate
immigration,
then
that
maybe
supportable
to
the
extent
of
our
argument
as
to
the
preemption
aspect
of
federal
law
over
state
law.
however,
that
is
not
supportable
in
our
equal
protection
argument.
i
would
go
on
now
to
the
interest
affected.
the
interest
affected
by
the
operation
of
the
arizona
act,
is
a
very,
very
serious
interest.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
observed
earlier,
these
people
may
well
starve.
these
are
people
who
came
to
this
country
by
permission
of
the
federal
government
or
invitation,
these
people
came
here
and
for
some
reason
they
became
destitute.
and
the
public
systems
such
as
old-age
or
the
aid
to
the
disabled
as
sought
by
the
appellee
here
is
something
to
barely
keep
the
person
going.
the
interest
is
vital.
as
compared
to
the
interest
of
the
state,
the
interest
of
the
individual
must
prevail.
the
argument
that
the
state
is
trying
to
save
part
of
a
sinking
ship
is
not
very
convincing
to
me.
we
all
know
that
if
you’re
on
a
sinking
ship
and
you
may
have
to
throw
someone
overboard,
in
order
to
keep
the
ship
afloat.
now,
the
question
is
who
we
should
throw
overboard?
the
state’s
argument
say
we
can
throw
the
alien
overboard
because
this
court
had
allowed
the
states
to
do
so.
i
don’t
think
that
the
privacy
of
the
state
of
this
court
has
really
authorized
the
state
to
do
that
and
i
think
to
throw
aliens
overboard
without
more
is
unconstitutional
to
say
the
least,
that
there
is
a
greater
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
government
or
the
federal
government
based
on
humanitarian
interest
to
see
if
we
can
save
and
protect
every
person.
even
though
if
everybody
may
get
by
with
little
less.
to
arbitrarily
--
to
use
the
phrase,
“selfishness
to
just
preserve
one’s
immediate
family
and
throw
other
people
to
the
wolves”
is
not
a
type
of
doctrine
that
will
survive
today
when
the
existence
of
mankind
depends
on
the
cooperation
of
everybody
and
out
of
self-interest
to
protect
one's
immediate
surrounding
members.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
aliens
have
just
by
all
the
obligations
i
can
think
of
being
an
alien
myself
at
one
time.
i
would
say
that
the
aliens
pay
all
taxes;
property
tax,
income
tax,
sales
tax.
the
aliens
are
subject
to
the
draft,
the
military
service.
they
are
allowed
to
work
and
from
their
work,
they
pay
taxes.
i
cannot
think
of
any
obligation
that
the
aliens
are
exempted
from.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
unless
you
view
upon
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote
as
an
obligation
rather
than
a
right
and
the
aliens
do
not
vote.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i
believe
again
this
is
not
before
this
court,
i
believe
that
as
elections
are
purely
local
in
nature
which
affects
a
direct
interest
of
an
alien,
for
example,
a
bond
issue
which
will
affect
his
property
tax
and
if
that
alien
could
not
become
a
u.s.
citizen
solely
because
of
the
language
requirement,
i
will
say
to
deny
that
that
person’s
right
to
vote
may
well
be
unconstitutional.
as
to
election
for
national
offices
or
the
national
government,
where
the
aliens’
loyalty
to
another
country
may
color
his
vote,
i
would
say
that
can
be
sustained.
their
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
but
that
is
not
before
this
court
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
i’m
saying
that
depending
on
the
interest
affected.
in
other
words,
if
the
election
is
on
the
question
whether
or
not
your
taxes
on
your
home
will
be
increased
to
pay
for
new
schools
and
an
alien
owner
of
a
home
cannot
vote
and
yet
he’s
subject
to
the
tax,
i
would
say
that
denial
for
the
alien
to
vote
in
that
case,
assuming
that
he
had
not
become
a
citizen
within
the
requisite
time
due
to
other
considerations,
i
would
say
that
denial
may
well
be
unconstitutional
but
this
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
the
statute
as
cited
in
my
brief
provided
for
deportation
as
it
causes
arising
before
they
come
and
not
as
it
causes
after
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
nationalization
and
immigration
if
that
is
made
part
of
the
scheme
to
legislate
in
this
area.
whether
that
type
of
legislation
as
to
aliens
who
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
visa
become
residents
in
the
united
states,
whether
or
not
that
provision
violates
equal
protection.
it’s
something
that
i
cannot
even
speculate
at
this
time.
this
court
will
have
to
take
it
up
on
another
occasion.
that
will
be
the
question
between
one
power
of
congress
versus
another
power
or
where
this
is
a
same
situation
whether
or
not
that
provision
will
violate
the
treaties.
maybe
the
forum
to
raise
will
be
something
international
tribunal,
i
don’t
know
but
this
has
been
speculated
by
people
who
are
writing
legal
treatises
but
i
cannot
really
give
all
the
answers
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
think
the
issue
is
where
you
draw
the
line
as
to
where
the
direct
interest
disappears
and
the
interest
will
be
indirect
and
the
decision
of
this
court
has
always
been
trying
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i’m
just
responding
to
questions
from
the
bench
and
perhaps
i
am
being
too
loquacious
in
discussing
constitutional
law.
i
would
--[laughter]
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
enjoy
--
being
from
an
academic
community,
i
enjoy
talking
about
extract
principles.
i
understand
and
i
must
emphasize
that
my
answers
to
these
questions
has
no
bearing
to
this
particular
case
because
we’re
dealing
with
the
state
statute.
we
are
arguing
that
a
state
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
and
that
prior
decision
of
this
court
such
as
truax
v.
raich,
yick
wo,
and
the
latest
case
of
this
court
in
takahashi
v.
california
fish
and
game
commission
very
clearly
show
that
the
states
can
no
longer
deny
aliens
some
of
the
basic
necessities
of
life
such
as
employment,
on
this
case,
welfare
benefits.
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
flam,
the
case
of
heim
v.
mccall
which
came
out
the
same
year,
as
truax
v.
raich,
and
also
people
versus
crane,
these
are
cases
decided
in
another
day
and
age
based
on
the
right
of
privilege
to
the
economy
and
i
do
not
believe
that
these
cases
should
be
used
as
authority
for
this
court
today
and
that
these
case
should
be
overruled.
further,
we
have
additional
arguments
including
that
of
the
preemption
argument
that
since
the
federal
government
had
provided
for
immigration
nationalization
under
the
foreign
commerce
power
and
under
the
power
to
regulate
immigration
and
nationalization.
the
states
can
no
more
enter
the
area
because
it
conflicts
with
the
national
power
and
the
supremacy
clause.
here
we
got
several
cases
by
this
court,
fong
yue
ting
case
and
the
case
of
hines
versus
davidowitz
are
in
point.
further,
we
have
congressional
statutes
in
point
governing
the
equal
protection
of
laws
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1870
which
is
now
in
42
u.s.c
1981
and
that
statute
was
cited
with
approval
in
both
truax
v.
raich
and
the
takahashi
case
as
providing
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
including
aliens.
but
that
statute
is
very
specific
and
say
that,
“all
persons
within
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
must
be
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
the
full
and
equal
benefits
of
all
laws.”
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
civil
rights
of
1964
in
42
u.s.c.
2000d.
so,
it's
our
position
that
the
decision
in
the
lower
court
can
be
sustained
on
any
and
all
grounds
raised
by
our
brief
and
that
there
are
cases
squarely
in
point
--
from
precedents
decided
by
this
court
and
that
therefore
we
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
rendered
by
the
court
below.
are
there
any
more
questions?
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
this
time
reply
very
briefly
to
the
reply
brief
submitted
by
the
appellant.
the
appellant
apparently
found
that
one
of
the
argument
raised
in
the
appellee’s
brief,
the
argument
that
the
state
law
here
conflicts
with
the
treaties
made
by
united
states,
namely
the
u.n.
charter
and
the
charter
of
the
oas.
since
that
argument
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below,
we
should
not
raise
it
here.
in
reply
to
that
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
is
a
general
appellate
rule
that
any
decision
by
a
lower
court
should
be
affirmed
if
there’s
any
basis
or
ground
to
affirm
that
decision
even
if
the
affirming
of
the
case
would
rely
on
grounds
not
otherwise
raised
in
a
court
below.
this
is
different
than
appellant’s
position
which
is
--
you
can
reverse
a
case
on
a
basis
of
a
ground
which
has
not
been
established
below.
in
other
words,
the
lower
court
had
no
opportunity
to
review
that
claim
and
somehow
the
result
would
have
been
different.
and
to
support
my
theory,
there
are
two
cases
decided
by
this
court,
very
squarely
in
point.
these
cases
are
helvering
versus
gowran
in
302
u.s.
238
and
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery
corporation
318
u.s.
80.
the
appellees’
brief
raised
four
different
grounds
for
the
affirmance
of
a
decision
below.
i
would
discuss
each
of
them
in
this
argument.
the
first
basis
for
affirming
the
decision
is
that
the
united
states
government
has
on
several
occasions
entered
into
multilateral
treaties
with
other
nations
and
particularly,
the
united
nations
charter
which
governs
this
country,
the
same
as
any
other
treaty.
this
was
the
view
that
was
advanced
in
an
earlier
case
argued
before
this
court
in
rice
versus
sioux
city,
cemetery
case
cited
in
my
brief
and
the
court
on
rehearing
has
said
that
that
argument
was
not
without
merit.
we
know
that
the
united
states
is
a
leader
of
the
free
world
and
that
everything
that
we
do
reflect
very
seriously
on
our
posture
broad.
specifically,
if
the
states
are
allowed
to
discriminate
against
aliens,
nationals
of
other
countries
who
are
invited
to
come
to
this
country
and
there
are
immigration
powers,
it
will
weaken
our
posture
before
the
other
nations.
and
for
this
reason,
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
conflict
with
the
national
interest
and
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states
government.
and
more
particularly,
since
it
is
established
that
most
of
the
aliens
in
arizona
are
aliens
of
mexican
origin,
we
are
bound
by
the
treaty
called
the
charter
of
the
organization
of
american
states
and
the
oas
charter
as
cited
in
my
brief,
very
specifically
provided
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
within
the
respective
jurisdictions.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
as
for
the
alien's
right
to
vote
is
concerned,
it
raises
two
different
issues
which
is
near
them
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
however,
if
the
court
wishes
i
will
very
briefly
discuss
that.
first
of
all,
as
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
aware
of
that,
however
in
oyama
v.
california
again
cited
before
this
court
and
decided
by
this
court,
four
of
the
justice
of
this
court
felt
that
the
united
nation
charter
has
some
relevancy
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
justice
white,
i
didn't
quite
follow
your
question.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
if
they
reside
within
the
jurisdictional
boundary
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
for
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
believe
this
is
an
area
which
is
reserved
to
the
countries
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly,
plus
a
federal
deportation
is
a
question
of
congressional
powers.
we’re
dealing
here
with
states
who
attempt
to
exercise
powers
that
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
powers
and
the
federal
policy
as
established
by
treaties
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
raises
a
host
of
other
problems
which
i’m
not
prepared
this
time
to
go
into
it
whether
or
not
alien
has
standing
to
raise
congressional
statutes
which
maybe
unconstitutional.
i
will
now
argue
the
equal
protection
argument
which
i
believe
is
our
chief
argument
and
which
is
the
argument
sustained
by
the
court
below
in
rendering
the
favorable
decision.
although
the
argument
was
listed
last
in
my
brief.
there
was
no
question
in
my
mind
that
based
on
previous
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens.
the
only
argument
that
is
raised
by
mr.
flam
is
that
for
some
reason
the
states
can
discriminate
against
aliens,
if
they
have
a
so-called
special
public
interest.
i
do
not
believe
that
mr.
flam
had
re-articulated
what
that
interest
is,
other
than
the
saving
of
money.
we
do
have
a
classification
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
there
are
two
classes,
a
and
b;
a
would
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
residing
in
arizona,
and
b
will
be
the
resident
aliens
in
arizona.
and
under
b,
there
are
two
subclasses.
first,
those
aliens
who
have
lived
in
arizona
for
15
years
or
more,
who
have
lived
in
united
states
for
15
years
or
more
and,
two,
those
who
have
not
lived
in
the
united
states
for
15
years.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
because
it
still
discriminates
against
the
alien
residents
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
unless
the
state
can
show
that
the
six-month
period
is
necessary
for
them
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
an
alien.
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
why
is
it
that
it
would
take
less
time
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
a
citizen.
as
i
see
it,
to
determine
eligibility
is
something
which
you
have
to
do
for
both
alien
and
citizens
alike.
and
certainly,
there’s
a
period
of
time
for
the
application
to
be
processed
and
to
conduct
proper
investigation
as
to
eligibility.
but
there’s
no
reason
to
require
a
longer
period
for
that
purpose
for
aliens.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
social
security
act
as
argued
by
mr.
flam
is
not
expressly
in
point.
it
permits
the
states
under
the
interpretation
placed
by
hew
in
the
handbook
provision
for
the
states
to
enact
requirements
of
residency
or
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
or
to
deny
aliens
from
any
benefits
entirely.
the
statute
is
not
a
mandatory
one
and
that
the
statute
merely
permits
them
to
so
discriminate.
i
would
submit
that
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
merely
permissive
and
secondly
congress
can
no
more
authorize
the
states
to
violate
equal
protection,
then
the
states
can
violate
equal
protection.
this
is
a
precise
language
used
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
this
issue
was
before
this
court
as
to
durational
residency
requirement
for
all
persons
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
the
congressional
act
provided
the
states
may
enact
duration
of
residency
requirement.
and
this
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
act.
the
argument
on
the
other
side
of
course,
will
be
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
immigration
and
if
congress
exercised
that
power
and
expressly
provided
that
as
part
of
the
immigration
scheme
that
aliens
should
not
get
welfare
and
if
the
congressional
history
adequately
established
that
and
if
it
has
been
through
an
overall
scheme
to
regulate
immigration,
then
that
maybe
supportable
to
the
extent
of
our
argument
as
to
the
preemption
aspect
of
federal
law
over
state
law.
however,
that
is
not
supportable
in
our
equal
protection
argument.
i
would
go
on
now
to
the
interest
affected.
the
interest
affected
by
the
operation
of
the
arizona
act,
is
a
very,
very
serious
interest.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
observed
earlier,
these
people
may
well
starve.
these
are
people
who
came
to
this
country
by
permission
of
the
federal
government
or
invitation,
these
people
came
here
and
for
some
reason
they
became
destitute.
and
the
public
systems
such
as
old-age
or
the
aid
to
the
disabled
as
sought
by
the
appellee
here
is
something
to
barely
keep
the
person
going.
the
interest
is
vital.
as
compared
to
the
interest
of
the
state,
the
interest
of
the
individual
must
prevail.
the
argument
that
the
state
is
trying
to
save
part
of
a
sinking
ship
is
not
very
convincing
to
me.
we
all
know
that
if
you’re
on
a
sinking
ship
and
you
may
have
to
throw
someone
overboard,
in
order
to
keep
the
ship
afloat.
now,
the
question
is
who
we
should
throw
overboard?
the
state’s
argument
say
we
can
throw
the
alien
overboard
because
this
court
had
allowed
the
states
to
do
so.
i
don’t
think
that
the
privacy
of
the
state
of
this
court
has
really
authorized
the
state
to
do
that
and
i
think
to
throw
aliens
overboard
without
more
is
unconstitutional
to
say
the
least,
that
there
is
a
greater
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
government
or
the
federal
government
based
on
humanitarian
interest
to
see
if
we
can
save
and
protect
every
person.
even
though
if
everybody
may
get
by
with
little
less.
to
arbitrarily
--
to
use
the
phrase,
“selfishness
to
just
preserve
one’s
immediate
family
and
throw
other
people
to
the
wolves”
is
not
a
type
of
doctrine
that
will
survive
today
when
the
existence
of
mankind
depends
on
the
cooperation
of
everybody
and
out
of
self-interest
to
protect
one's
immediate
surrounding
members.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
aliens
have
just
by
all
the
obligations
i
can
think
of
being
an
alien
myself
at
one
time.
i
would
say
that
the
aliens
pay
all
taxes;
property
tax,
income
tax,
sales
tax.
the
aliens
are
subject
to
the
draft,
the
military
service.
they
are
allowed
to
work
and
from
their
work,
they
pay
taxes.
i
cannot
think
of
any
obligation
that
the
aliens
are
exempted
from.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
unless
you
view
upon
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote
as
an
obligation
rather
than
a
right
and
the
aliens
do
not
vote.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i
believe
again
this
is
not
before
this
court,
i
believe
that
as
elections
are
purely
local
in
nature
which
affects
a
direct
interest
of
an
alien,
for
example,
a
bond
issue
which
will
affect
his
property
tax
and
if
that
alien
could
not
become
a
u.s.
citizen
solely
because
of
the
language
requirement,
i
will
say
to
deny
that
that
person’s
right
to
vote
may
well
be
unconstitutional.
as
to
election
for
national
offices
or
the
national
government,
where
the
aliens’
loyalty
to
another
country
may
color
his
vote,
i
would
say
that
can
be
sustained.
their
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
but
that
is
not
before
this
court
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
i’m
saying
that
depending
on
the
interest
affected.
in
other
words,
if
the
election
is
on
the
question
whether
or
not
your
taxes
on
your
home
will
be
increased
to
pay
for
new
schools
and
an
alien
owner
of
a
home
cannot
vote
and
yet
he’s
subject
to
the
tax,
i
would
say
that
denial
for
the
alien
to
vote
in
that
case,
assuming
that
he
had
not
become
a
citizen
within
the
requisite
time
due
to
other
considerations,
i
would
say
that
denial
may
well
be
unconstitutional
but
this
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
the
statute
as
cited
in
my
brief
provided
for
deportation
as
it
causes
arising
before
they
come
and
not
as
it
causes
after
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
nationalization
and
immigration
if
that
is
made
part
of
the
scheme
to
legislate
in
this
area.
whether
that
type
of
legislation
as
to
aliens
who
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
visa
become
residents
in
the
united
states,
whether
or
not
that
provision
violates
equal
protection.
it’s
something
that
i
cannot
even
speculate
at
this
time.
this
court
will
have
to
take
it
up
on
another
occasion.
that
will
be
the
question
between
one
power
of
congress
versus
another
power
or
where
this
is
a
same
situation
whether
or
not
that
provision
will
violate
the
treaties.
maybe
the
forum
to
raise
will
be
something
international
tribunal,
i
don’t
know
but
this
has
been
speculated
by
people
who
are
writing
legal
treatises
but
i
cannot
really
give
all
the
answers
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
think
the
issue
is
where
you
draw
the
line
as
to
where
the
direct
interest
disappears
and
the
interest
will
be
indirect
and
the
decision
of
this
court
has
always
been
trying
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i’m
just
responding
to
questions
from
the
bench
and
perhaps
i
am
being
too
loquacious
in
discussing
constitutional
law.
i
would
--[laughter]
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
enjoy
--
being
from
an
academic
community,
i
enjoy
talking
about
extract
principles.
i
understand
and
i
must
emphasize
that
my
answers
to
these
questions
has
no
bearing
to
this
particular
case
because
we’re
dealing
with
the
state
statute.
we
are
arguing
that
a
state
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
and
that
prior
decision
of
this
court
such
as
truax
v.
raich,
yick
wo,
and
the
latest
case
of
this
court
in
takahashi
v.
california
fish
and
game
commission
very
clearly
show
that
the
states
can
no
longer
deny
aliens
some
of
the
basic
necessities
of
life
such
as
employment,
on
this
case,
welfare
benefits.
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
flam,
the
case
of
heim
v.
mccall
which
came
out
the
same
year,
as
truax
v.
raich,
and
also
people
versus
crane,
these
are
cases
decided
in
another
day
and
age
based
on
the
right
of
privilege
to
the
economy
and
i
do
not
believe
that
these
cases
should
be
used
as
authority
for
this
court
today
and
that
these
case
should
be
overruled.
further,
we
have
additional
arguments
including
that
of
the
preemption
argument
that
since
the
federal
government
had
provided
for
immigration
nationalization
under
the
foreign
commerce
power
and
under
the
power
to
regulate
immigration
and
nationalization.
the
states
can
no
more
enter
the
area
because
it
conflicts
with
the
national
power
and
the
supremacy
clause.
here
we
got
several
cases
by
this
court,
fong
yue
ting
case
and
the
case
of
hines
versus
davidowitz
are
in
point.
further,
we
have
congressional
statutes
in
point
governing
the
equal
protection
of
laws
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1870
which
is
now
in
42
u.s.c
1981
and
that
statute
was
cited
with
approval
in
both
truax
v.
raich
and
the
takahashi
case
as
providing
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
including
aliens.
but
that
statute
is
very
specific
and
say
that,
“all
persons
within
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
must
be
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
the
full
and
equal
benefits
of
all
laws.”
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
civil
rights
of
1964
in
42
u.s.c.
2000d.
so,
it's
our
position
that
the
decision
in
the
lower
court
can
be
sustained
on
any
and
all
grounds
raised
by
our
brief
and
that
there
are
cases
squarely
in
point
--
from
precedents
decided
by
this
court
and
that
therefore
we
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
rendered
by
the
court
below.
are
there
any
more
questions?
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
this
time
reply
very
briefly
to
the
reply
brief
submitted
by
the
appellant.
the
appellant
apparently
found
that
one
of
the
argument
raised
in
the
appellee’s
brief,
the
argument
that
the
state
law
here
conflicts
with
the
treaties
made
by
united
states,
namely
the
u.n.
charter
and
the
charter
of
the
oas.
since
that
argument
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below,
we
should
not
raise
it
here.
in
reply
to
that
argument,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
is
a
general
appellate
rule
that
any
decision
by
a
lower
court
should
be
affirmed
if
there’s
any
basis
or
ground
to
affirm
that
decision
even
if
the
affirming
of
the
case
would
rely
on
grounds
not
otherwise
raised
in
a
court
below.
this
is
different
than
appellant’s
position
which
is
--
you
can
reverse
a
case
on
a
basis
of
a
ground
which
has
not
been
established
below.
in
other
words,
the
lower
court
had
no
opportunity
to
review
that
claim
and
somehow
the
result
would
have
been
different.
and
to
support
my
theory,
there
are
two
cases
decided
by
this
court,
very
squarely
in
point.
these
cases
are
helvering
versus
gowran
in
302
u.s.
238
and
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
chenery
corporation
318
u.s.
80.
the
appellees’
brief
raised
four
different
grounds
for
the
affirmance
of
a
decision
below.
i
would
discuss
each
of
them
in
this
argument.
the
first
basis
for
affirming
the
decision
is
that
the
united
states
government
has
on
several
occasions
entered
into
multilateral
treaties
with
other
nations
and
particularly,
the
united
nations
charter
which
governs
this
country,
the
same
as
any
other
treaty.
this
was
the
view
that
was
advanced
in
an
earlier
case
argued
before
this
court
in
rice
versus
sioux
city,
cemetery
case
cited
in
my
brief
and
the
court
on
rehearing
has
said
that
that
argument
was
not
without
merit.
we
know
that
the
united
states
is
a
leader
of
the
free
world
and
that
everything
that
we
do
reflect
very
seriously
on
our
posture
broad.
specifically,
if
the
states
are
allowed
to
discriminate
against
aliens,
nationals
of
other
countries
who
are
invited
to
come
to
this
country
and
there
are
immigration
powers,
it
will
weaken
our
posture
before
the
other
nations.
and
for
this
reason,
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
conflict
with
the
national
interest
and
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states
government.
and
more
particularly,
since
it
is
established
that
most
of
the
aliens
in
arizona
are
aliens
of
mexican
origin,
we
are
bound
by
the
treaty
called
the
charter
of
the
organization
of
american
states
and
the
oas
charter
as
cited
in
my
brief,
very
specifically
provided
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
within
the
respective
jurisdictions.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
as
for
the
alien's
right
to
vote
is
concerned,
it
raises
two
different
issues
which
is
near
them
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
however,
if
the
court
wishes
i
will
very
briefly
discuss
that.
first
of
all,
as
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i’m
aware
of
that,
however
in
oyama
v.
california
again
cited
before
this
court
and
decided
by
this
court,
four
of
the
justice
of
this
court
felt
that
the
united
nation
charter
has
some
relevancy
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
mr.
justice
white,
i
didn't
quite
follow
your
question.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
if
they
reside
within
the
jurisdictional
boundary
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
for
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
believe
this
is
an
area
which
is
reserved
to
the
countries
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
exactly,
plus
a
federal
deportation
is
a
question
of
congressional
powers.
we’re
dealing
here
with
states
who
attempt
to
exercise
powers
that
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
powers
and
the
federal
policy
as
established
by
treaties
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
this
raises
a
host
of
other
problems
which
i’m
not
prepared
this
time
to
go
into
it
whether
or
not
alien
has
standing
to
raise
congressional
statutes
which
maybe
unconstitutional.
i
will
now
argue
the
equal
protection
argument
which
i
believe
is
our
chief
argument
and
which
is
the
argument
sustained
by
the
court
below
in
rendering
the
favorable
decision.
although
the
argument
was
listed
last
in
my
brief.
there
was
no
question
in
my
mind
that
based
on
previous
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
apply
to
aliens.
the
only
argument
that
is
raised
by
mr.
flam
is
that
for
some
reason
the
states
can
discriminate
against
aliens,
if
they
have
a
so-called
special
public
interest.
i
do
not
believe
that
mr.
flam
had
re-articulated
what
that
interest
is,
other
than
the
saving
of
money.
we
do
have
a
classification
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
there
are
two
classes,
a
and
b;
a
would
be
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
residing
in
arizona,
and
b
will
be
the
resident
aliens
in
arizona.
and
under
b,
there
are
two
subclasses.
first,
those
aliens
who
have
lived
in
arizona
for
15
years
or
more,
who
have
lived
in
united
states
for
15
years
or
more
and,
two,
those
who
have
not
lived
in
the
united
states
for
15
years.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
because
it
still
discriminates
against
the
alien
residents
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
unless
the
state
can
show
that
the
six-month
period
is
necessary
for
them
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
an
alien.
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
why
is
it
that
it
would
take
less
time
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
of
a
citizen.
as
i
see
it,
to
determine
eligibility
is
something
which
you
have
to
do
for
both
alien
and
citizens
alike.
and
certainly,
there’s
a
period
of
time
for
the
application
to
be
processed
and
to
conduct
proper
investigation
as
to
eligibility.
but
there’s
no
reason
to
require
a
longer
period
for
that
purpose
for
aliens.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
social
security
act
as
argued
by
mr.
flam
is
not
expressly
in
point.
it
permits
the
states
under
the
interpretation
placed
by
hew
in
the
handbook
provision
for
the
states
to
enact
requirements
of
residency
or
to
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
or
to
deny
aliens
from
any
benefits
entirely.
the
statute
is
not
a
mandatory
one
and
that
the
statute
merely
permits
them
to
so
discriminate.
i
would
submit
that
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
merely
permissive
and
secondly
congress
can
no
more
authorize
the
states
to
violate
equal
protection,
then
the
states
can
violate
equal
protection.
this
is
a
precise
language
used
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes,
this
issue
was
before
this
court
as
to
durational
residency
requirement
for
all
persons
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
the
congressional
act
provided
the
states
may
enact
duration
of
residency
requirement.
and
this
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
act.
the
argument
on
the
other
side
of
course,
will
be
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
immigration
and
if
congress
exercised
that
power
and
expressly
provided
that
as
part
of
the
immigration
scheme
that
aliens
should
not
get
welfare
and
if
the
congressional
history
adequately
established
that
and
if
it
has
been
through
an
overall
scheme
to
regulate
immigration,
then
that
maybe
supportable
to
the
extent
of
our
argument
as
to
the
preemption
aspect
of
federal
law
over
state
law.
however,
that
is
not
supportable
in
our
equal
protection
argument.
i
would
go
on
now
to
the
interest
affected.
the
interest
affected
by
the
operation
of
the
arizona
act,
is
a
very,
very
serious
interest.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
observed
earlier,
these
people
may
well
starve.
these
are
people
who
came
to
this
country
by
permission
of
the
federal
government
or
invitation,
these
people
came
here
and
for
some
reason
they
became
destitute.
and
the
public
systems
such
as
old-age
or
the
aid
to
the
disabled
as
sought
by
the
appellee
here
is
something
to
barely
keep
the
person
going.
the
interest
is
vital.
as
compared
to
the
interest
of
the
state,
the
interest
of
the
individual
must
prevail.
the
argument
that
the
state
is
trying
to
save
part
of
a
sinking
ship
is
not
very
convincing
to
me.
we
all
know
that
if
you’re
on
a
sinking
ship
and
you
may
have
to
throw
someone
overboard,
in
order
to
keep
the
ship
afloat.
now,
the
question
is
who
we
should
throw
overboard?
the
state’s
argument
say
we
can
throw
the
alien
overboard
because
this
court
had
allowed
the
states
to
do
so.
i
don’t
think
that
the
privacy
of
the
state
of
this
court
has
really
authorized
the
state
to
do
that
and
i
think
to
throw
aliens
overboard
without
more
is
unconstitutional
to
say
the
least,
that
there
is
a
greater
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
government
or
the
federal
government
based
on
humanitarian
interest
to
see
if
we
can
save
and
protect
every
person.
even
though
if
everybody
may
get
by
with
little
less.
to
arbitrarily
--
to
use
the
phrase,
“selfishness
to
just
preserve
one’s
immediate
family
and
throw
other
people
to
the
wolves”
is
not
a
type
of
doctrine
that
will
survive
today
when
the
existence
of
mankind
depends
on
the
cooperation
of
everybody
and
out
of
self-interest
to
protect
one's
immediate
surrounding
members.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
the
aliens
have
just
by
all
the
obligations
i
can
think
of
being
an
alien
myself
at
one
time.
i
would
say
that
the
aliens
pay
all
taxes;
property
tax,
income
tax,
sales
tax.
the
aliens
are
subject
to
the
draft,
the
military
service.
they
are
allowed
to
work
and
from
their
work,
they
pay
taxes.
i
cannot
think
of
any
obligation
that
the
aliens
are
exempted
from.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
unless
you
view
upon
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote
as
an
obligation
rather
than
a
right
and
the
aliens
do
not
vote.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i
believe
again
this
is
not
before
this
court,
i
believe
that
as
elections
are
purely
local
in
nature
which
affects
a
direct
interest
of
an
alien,
for
example,
a
bond
issue
which
will
affect
his
property
tax
and
if
that
alien
could
not
become
a
u.s.
citizen
solely
because
of
the
language
requirement,
i
will
say
to
deny
that
that
person’s
right
to
vote
may
well
be
unconstitutional.
as
to
election
for
national
offices
or
the
national
government,
where
the
aliens’
loyalty
to
another
country
may
color
his
vote,
i
would
say
that
can
be
sustained.
their
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
but
that
is
not
before
this
court
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
i’m
not
saying
that.
i’m
saying
that
depending
on
the
interest
affected.
in
other
words,
if
the
election
is
on
the
question
whether
or
not
your
taxes
on
your
home
will
be
increased
to
pay
for
new
schools
and
an
alien
owner
of
a
home
cannot
vote
and
yet
he’s
subject
to
the
tax,
i
would
say
that
denial
for
the
alien
to
vote
in
that
case,
assuming
that
he
had
not
become
a
citizen
within
the
requisite
time
due
to
other
considerations,
i
would
say
that
denial
may
well
be
unconstitutional
but
this
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
no,
the
statute
as
cited
in
my
brief
provided
for
deportation
as
it
causes
arising
before
they
come
and
not
as
it
causes
after
--
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce,
nationalization
and
immigration
if
that
is
made
part
of
the
scheme
to
legislate
in
this
area.
whether
that
type
of
legislation
as
to
aliens
who
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
visa
become
residents
in
the
united
states,
whether
or
not
that
provision
violates
equal
protection.
it’s
something
that
i
cannot
even
speculate
at
this
time.
this
court
will
have
to
take
it
up
on
another
occasion.
that
will
be
the
question
between
one
power
of
congress
versus
another
power
or
where
this
is
a
same
situation
whether
or
not
that
provision
will
violate
the
treaties.
maybe
the
forum
to
raise
will
be
something
international
tribunal,
i
don’t
know
but
this
has
been
speculated
by
people
who
are
writing
legal
treatises
but
i
cannot
really
give
all
the
answers
today.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
i
think
the
issue
is
where
you
draw
the
line
as
to
where
the
direct
interest
disappears
and
the
interest
will
be
indirect
and
the
decision
of
this
court
has
always
been
trying
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
yes.
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
i’m
just
responding
to
questions
from
the
bench
and
perhaps
i
am
being
too
loquacious
in
discussing
constitutional
law.
i
would
--[laughter]
mr.
anthony
b.
ching
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
enjoy
--
being
from
an
academic
community,
i
enjoy
talking
about
extract
principles.
i
understand
and
i
must
emphasize
that
my
answers
to
these
questions
has
no
bearing
to
this
particular
case
because
we’re
dealing
with
the
state
statute.
we
are
arguing
that
a
state
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
and
that
prior
decision
of
this
court
such
as
truax
v.
raich,
yick
wo,
and
the
latest
case
of
this
court
in
takahashi
v.
california
fish
and
game
commission
very
clearly
show
that
the
states
can
no
longer
deny
aliens
some
of
the
basic
necessities
of
life
such
as
employment,
on
this
case,
welfare
benefits.
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
flam,
the
case
of
heim
v.
mccall
which
came
out
the
same
year,
as
truax
v.
raich,
and
also
people
versus
crane,
these
are
cases
decided
in
another
day
and
age
based
on
the
right
of
privilege
to
the
economy
and
i
do
not
believe
that
these
cases
should
be
used
as
authority
for
this
court
today
and
that
these
case
should
be
overruled.
further,
we
have
additional
arguments
including
that
of
the
preemption
argument
that
since
the
federal
government
had
provided
for
immigration
nationalization
under
the
foreign
commerce
power
and
under
the
power
to
regulate
immigration
and
nationalization.
the
states
can
no
more
enter
the
area
because
it
conflicts
with
the
national
power
and
the
supremacy
clause.
here
we
got
several
cases
by
this
court,
fong
yue
ting
case
and
the
case
of
hines
versus
davidowitz
are
in
point.
further,
we
have
congressional
statutes
in
point
governing
the
equal
protection
of
laws
with
the
civil
rights
act
of
1870
which
is
now
in
42
u.s.c
1981
and
that
statute
was
cited
with
approval
in
both
truax
v.
raich
and
the
takahashi
case
as
providing
for
equal
treatment
of
all
persons
including
aliens.
but
that
statute
is
very
specific
and
say
that,
“all
persons
within
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
must
be
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
the
full
and
equal
benefits
of
all
laws.”
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
civil
rights
of
1964
in
42
u.s.c.
2000d.
so,
it's
our
position
that
the
decision
in
the
lower
court
can
be
sustained
on
any
and
all
grounds
raised
by
our
brief
and
that
there
are
cases
squarely
in
point
