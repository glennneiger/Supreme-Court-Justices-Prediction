mr.
michael
s.
flam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
arizona’s
legislative
policy
which
requires
a
person
to
be
a
united
states’
citizen
or
in
lieu
of
united
states
citizenship,
a
resident
of
the
united
states
for
15
years
as
a
condition
for
obtaining
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
there
are
seven
other
states
that
have
similar
provisions.
briefly,
the
facts,
the
named
appellee
carmen
richardson
is
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
to
this
country
under
our
laws.
she
has
been
a
continuous
resident
of
the
state
of
arizona
for
13
years.
mrs.
richardson,
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
was
eligible
for
assistance
under
the
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
program
but
for
the
united
states
citizenship
requirement
for
in
lieu
of
u.s.
citizenship
to
15
years
to
national
residency
requirement.
appellee
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
citizenship
requirements.
it
claimed
in
(inaudible)
was
that
the
citizenship
requirements
violated
her
right
to
travel
and
denied
her
equal
protection
under
the
law
as
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
constitution.
she
also
alleged
two
statutory
grounds;
one
that
the
statute
violated
the
social
security
act;
and
two,
that
the
statute
violated
42
united
states
code
2000d.
the
district
court
after
hearing
enjoined
the
appellant
from
enforcing
that
united
states
citizenship
requirement
as
provided
by
arizona
law
and
there
after
upon
motion
of
the
appellant
state
judgment
pending
judicial
review
by
this
court.
we
would
first
like
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case
as
was
found
in
the
case
of
shapiro
v.
thompson.
all
the
state
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
create
two
classes
for
determining
who
shall
be
eligible
for
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
one
class
is
citizens,
the
other
are
aliens.
this
court,
by
prior
decisions
have
allowed
states
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
their
war
on
poverty.
specifically
we
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
people
v.
crane
wherein
justice
cardozo
stated
“to
disqualify
aliens
as
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.”
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
it
was
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
which
is
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
without
an
opinion.
but
his
opinion
in
the
lower
courts
is
very
instructive.
to
disqualify
aliens
is
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.
for
the
principle
of
exclusion
is
the
restriction
of
a
resources
to
the
state
to
the
advancement
and
profit
of
members
of
the
state.
ungenerous
and
unwise,
such
a
discrimination
maybe
is
not
for
that
reason
unlawful.
further,
last
term
this
court
decided
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams,
which
we
feel
is
very
instructive.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
in
the
area
of
economics
and
social
welfare,
the
state
does
not
violate
equal
protection
merely
because
the
classification
made
by
its
laws
were
imperfect.
if
the
classification
has
some
reasonable
basis,
it
does
not
offend
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
submit
the
state
does
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
favoring
u.s.
citizens
over
aliens.
funds
available
for
welfare
purposes
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
quite
limited.
for
example,
a
family
of
four
in
the
state
of
arizona
draw
an
adc,
the
maximum
payment
is
a
$167.00
a
month.
for
the
adult
program
such
as
the
one
the
appellee
applied
for
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no,
we
don’t
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
a
reasonable
basis,
i
think
what
i
like
to
equate
to
the
court
--
the
sums,
these
sums
are
barely
enough
to
sustain
life
for
the
persons
presently
participating
in
the
program.
now
to
further
dilute
the
funds
available
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
primary
reason.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that’s
a
reasonable
basis
in
light
of
the
decision
of
dandridge
v.
williams.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
it
was
enacted
approximately
in
1937.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
at
the
time
the
states
provided
for
welfare
assistance
and
received
funds
from
the
federal
government.
at
one
time,
the
residency
requirement
was
25
years,
that
i
believe
in
1956
it
was
lowered
to
the
present
15
year
limitation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
sir,
there’s
no
legislative
history
or
records.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
such,
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
to
conserve
funds,
right.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it
appears
that
--
you
know,
from
reading
the
statute,
that’s
the
purpose,
in
arizona,
funds
are
appropriate
on
an
annual
basis
for
welfare
and
they
cannot
be
increased
except
by
an
act
of
the
legislature.
so,
the
appellant
in
administering
the
welfare
programs
must
divide
the
funds
available
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
now,
by
adding
aliens
to
the
welfare
roles
would
dilute
the
funds
available
to
the
persons
presently
participating
and
as
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
sums
are
quite
low
and
to
add
two
to
3000
aliens
who
may
become
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
arizona
would
damage
their
program
tremendously.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes,
when
the
appellant
moved
for
a
stay
at
--
of
the
judgment
in
the
lower
court,
the
department
of
public
welfare
submitted
an
affidavit
by
their
director
of
assistance
payments
and
i
could
refer
to
court
to
page
53
of
the
appendix.
in
the
affidavit,
we
estimate
that
there
are
between
2600
and
3900
resident
aliens
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
of
course
some
of
those
people
have
met
the
15
year
residency
requirement,
so
that’s
why
we
have
the
2600
figure
and
the
high
figure
3900,
put
out
variation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
we
concede
that
most
of
the
resident
aliens
living
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
from
mexico.
however,
the
statute
applies
to
all
aliens
equally
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct,
it’s
a
national
residency
requirement
and
this
is
distinguishable
from
the
residency
requirement
that
was
stricken
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
recent
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
special
state
interest
doctrine
wherein
states
may
favor
citizens
over
aliens,
1948
case
of
takahashi
v.
fish
&
game
commission
which
is
much
discussed
in
the
briefs
uphold
that
provision.
however,
in
that
case,
this
court
could
not
find
that
the
state
of
california
had
a
special
state
interest
in
conserving
the
fish
off
its
coast.
i
think
one
thing
that
is
very
important
that
this
court
must
take
notice
of
that
the
states
are
experiencing
difficulty
in
their
welfare
programs.
specifically,
this
court
is
directed
to
the
problems
the
state
of
new
york
and
california
are
having.
the
city
of
new
york
went
bankrupt
several
weeks
ago
because
of
welfare
costs.
surely,
the
problem
is
plagued
by
these
states,
illustrates
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
well,
that’s
prerogative
of
the
state
legislature
and
we
do
have
a
problem
pertaining
to
welfare
not
only
in
the
state
of
arizona
but
in
every
state
or
union.
i
think
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
but
the
state
of
arizona
is
not
duty
bound
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
pardon?
mr.
michael
s.
flam
they
eat
sir.
but
past
decisions
of
this
court
have
upheld
the
right
of
the
state
of
arizona
and
other
states.
i
shouldn’t
say
arizona
but
other
doctrines
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens.
what
we’re
trying
to
do
is
save
a
part
of
the
sinking
ship.
i
think
everybody
is
in
agreement
that
the
welfare
programs
in
the
united
states
and
that
every
state
in
the
union
are
in
serious
trouble
and
they
are
not
doing
their
job.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
approximately
--
i
believe
seven
or
eight
states
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
florida,
texas,
pennsylvania
--
they
spread
it
out.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it’s
not
specifically
the
southwest
or
close
states
which
border
canada.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
we
do
sir.
they
pay
sales
taxes,
income
taxes,
just
like
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct
but
it's
not
incumbent
upon
the
state
of
arizona,
once
a
person
comes
from
a
foreign
country
to
live
within
the
state,
to
maintain
his
existence,
i
don’t
think
we
could
find
that
under
the
constitution
or
any
statutory
scheme
of
congress
or
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
true
for
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
we
submit
based
upon
the
special
stay
interest
doctrine
which
has
been
announced
by
this
court
in
previous
decisions
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
the
right
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
its
welfare
programs.
i
cannot
over
emphasized
the
importance
we
rely
upon
in
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
wherein
this
court
has
stated
that
the
constitution
does
not
empower
this
court
to
second
guess
state
officials
charged
with
the
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
appellees
rely
heavily
upon
the
right
to
travel.
however,
they
do
not
show
or
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
that
right
extends
to
aliens.
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
that
right
was
the
reason,
primary
reason
why
citizens
who
had
to
wait
one
year
were
deprived
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
assuming
arguendo
that
the
right
to
travel
does
extend
to
aliens.
the
statutes
in
question
we
submit,
do
not
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
that
right.
for
one
thing,
indigency
alone
severely
limits
one’s
mobility.
another
fact
not
to
be
overlooked
is
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
national
residency
requirement.
we
do
not
require
an
alien
to
reside
in
the
state
of
arizona.
the
requirement
is
that
you
reside
in
the
united
states.
known
is
our
law
impede
free
movement
or
job
opportunities.
the
flaw
of
the
appellee's
position
can
be
shown
by
a
logical
extension
of
their
argument.
if
an
alien
is
residing
in
one
state
for
example,
new
mexico
and
wishes
to
move
to
another
state,
for
example
my
state,
arizona,
where
arizona’s
welfare
benefits
are
less
than
new
mexico’s,
can
he
compel
the
state
of
arizona
to
raise
its
benefits?i
think
not.
if
the
court
accepts
the
appellees’
position
as
tenable,
that
all
distinctions
affecting
aliens
and
citizens
would
be
suspect.
clearly,
this
has
not
been
the
wisdom
of
the
court
in
the
past.
furthermore,
arizona’s
citizenship
policy
is
articulated
by
the
social
security
act
which
does
not
forbid
states
from
favoring
citizens
over
aliens
in
the
distribution
of
welfare
benefits.
this
interpretation
is
bolstered
by
committee
report
of
the
congress
which
states,
“a
state
may
if
it
wishes
assist
only
those
who
are
citizens
but
must
not
insist
on
there
haven’t
been
born
citizens
or
on
there
having
been
naturalized
citizens
for
a
specified
period
of
time.”
further,
this
has
been
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
the
person
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
social
security
act.
the
arizona
citizenship
requirements,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
affect
three
federally
matched
programs.
the
old-age
assistance
program,
the
program
the
appellee
applied
for,
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
and
the
aid
to
the
blind
program.
there
is
one
state
program
involved
in
this
case
and
that’s
the
general
assistance
program
which
is
solely
funded
by
the
state
of
arizona.
one
more
point,
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
the
statutory
issue
of
42,
2000d.
this
statute
states
that
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
because
of
national
origin
under
a
program
which
is
financed
by
federal
funds.
arizona’s
citizenship
requirements
apply
to
all
aliens,
regardless
of
national
origin.
we
do
not
distinguish
between
germans
or
englishman
or
japanese.
and
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
lassiter
versus
north
hampton
board
of
elections,
a
statute
does
not
violate
equal
protection,
if
it’s
applied
equally.
in
that
case,
north
carolina’s
literacy
test
was
upheld
for
the
reason
it
applied
to
all
races
on
an
equal
basis.
one
other
point,
if
a
united
states
citizen,
who
has
not
resided
in
the
united
states
for
15
years,
was
expatriated
and
at
a
later
date
was
allowed
into
this
country,
he
too
would
not
be
eligible
for
welfare
assistance.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
none
to
my
recollection.
this
is
the
theory
which
i
desire
to
point
out
to
the
court.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
the
appellant
waives
rebuttal
unless
there’s
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
arizona’s
legislative
policy
which
requires
a
person
to
be
a
united
states’
citizen
or
in
lieu
of
united
states
citizenship,
a
resident
of
the
united
states
for
15
years
as
a
condition
for
obtaining
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
there
are
seven
other
states
that
have
similar
provisions.
briefly,
the
facts,
the
named
appellee
carmen
richardson
is
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
to
this
country
under
our
laws.
she
has
been
a
continuous
resident
of
the
state
of
arizona
for
13
years.
mrs.
richardson,
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
was
eligible
for
assistance
under
the
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
program
but
for
the
united
states
citizenship
requirement
for
in
lieu
of
u.s.
citizenship
to
15
years
to
national
residency
requirement.
appellee
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
citizenship
requirements.
it
claimed
in
(inaudible)
was
that
the
citizenship
requirements
violated
her
right
to
travel
and
denied
her
equal
protection
under
the
law
as
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
constitution.
she
also
alleged
two
statutory
grounds;
one
that
the
statute
violated
the
social
security
act;
and
two,
that
the
statute
violated
42
united
states
code
2000d.
the
district
court
after
hearing
enjoined
the
appellant
from
enforcing
that
united
states
citizenship
requirement
as
provided
by
arizona
law
and
there
after
upon
motion
of
the
appellant
state
judgment
pending
judicial
review
by
this
court.
we
would
first
like
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case
as
was
found
in
the
case
of
shapiro
v.
thompson.
all
the
state
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
create
two
classes
for
determining
who
shall
be
eligible
for
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
one
class
is
citizens,
the
other
are
aliens.
this
court,
by
prior
decisions
have
allowed
states
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
their
war
on
poverty.
specifically
we
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
people
v.
crane
wherein
justice
cardozo
stated
“to
disqualify
aliens
as
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.”
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
it
was
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
which
is
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
without
an
opinion.
but
his
opinion
in
the
lower
courts
is
very
instructive.
to
disqualify
aliens
is
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.
for
the
principle
of
exclusion
is
the
restriction
of
a
resources
to
the
state
to
the
advancement
and
profit
of
members
of
the
state.
ungenerous
and
unwise,
such
a
discrimination
maybe
is
not
for
that
reason
unlawful.
further,
last
term
this
court
decided
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams,
which
we
feel
is
very
instructive.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
in
the
area
of
economics
and
social
welfare,
the
state
does
not
violate
equal
protection
merely
because
the
classification
made
by
its
laws
were
imperfect.
if
the
classification
has
some
reasonable
basis,
it
does
not
offend
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
submit
the
state
does
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
favoring
u.s.
citizens
over
aliens.
funds
available
for
welfare
purposes
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
quite
limited.
for
example,
a
family
of
four
in
the
state
of
arizona
draw
an
adc,
the
maximum
payment
is
a
$167.00
a
month.
for
the
adult
program
such
as
the
one
the
appellee
applied
for
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no,
we
don’t
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
a
reasonable
basis,
i
think
what
i
like
to
equate
to
the
court
--
the
sums,
these
sums
are
barely
enough
to
sustain
life
for
the
persons
presently
participating
in
the
program.
now
to
further
dilute
the
funds
available
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
primary
reason.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that’s
a
reasonable
basis
in
light
of
the
decision
of
dandridge
v.
williams.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
it
was
enacted
approximately
in
1937.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
at
the
time
the
states
provided
for
welfare
assistance
and
received
funds
from
the
federal
government.
at
one
time,
the
residency
requirement
was
25
years,
that
i
believe
in
1956
it
was
lowered
to
the
present
15
year
limitation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
sir,
there’s
no
legislative
history
or
records.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
such,
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
to
conserve
funds,
right.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it
appears
that
--
you
know,
from
reading
the
statute,
that’s
the
purpose,
in
arizona,
funds
are
appropriate
on
an
annual
basis
for
welfare
and
they
cannot
be
increased
except
by
an
act
of
the
legislature.
so,
the
appellant
in
administering
the
welfare
programs
must
divide
the
funds
available
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
now,
by
adding
aliens
to
the
welfare
roles
would
dilute
the
funds
available
to
the
persons
presently
participating
and
as
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
sums
are
quite
low
and
to
add
two
to
3000
aliens
who
may
become
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
arizona
would
damage
their
program
tremendously.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes,
when
the
appellant
moved
for
a
stay
at
--
of
the
judgment
in
the
lower
court,
the
department
of
public
welfare
submitted
an
affidavit
by
their
director
of
assistance
payments
and
i
could
refer
to
court
to
page
53
of
the
appendix.
in
the
affidavit,
we
estimate
that
there
are
between
2600
and
3900
resident
aliens
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
of
course
some
of
those
people
have
met
the
15
year
residency
requirement,
so
that’s
why
we
have
the
2600
figure
and
the
high
figure
3900,
put
out
variation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
we
concede
that
most
of
the
resident
aliens
living
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
from
mexico.
however,
the
statute
applies
to
all
aliens
equally
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct,
it’s
a
national
residency
requirement
and
this
is
distinguishable
from
the
residency
requirement
that
was
stricken
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
recent
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
special
state
interest
doctrine
wherein
states
may
favor
citizens
over
aliens,
1948
case
of
takahashi
v.
fish
&
game
commission
which
is
much
discussed
in
the
briefs
uphold
that
provision.
however,
in
that
case,
this
court
could
not
find
that
the
state
of
california
had
a
special
state
interest
in
conserving
the
fish
off
its
coast.
i
think
one
thing
that
is
very
important
that
this
court
must
take
notice
of
that
the
states
are
experiencing
difficulty
in
their
welfare
programs.
specifically,
this
court
is
directed
to
the
problems
the
state
of
new
york
and
california
are
having.
the
city
of
new
york
went
bankrupt
several
weeks
ago
because
of
welfare
costs.
surely,
the
problem
is
plagued
by
these
states,
illustrates
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
well,
that’s
prerogative
of
the
state
legislature
and
we
do
have
a
problem
pertaining
to
welfare
not
only
in
the
state
of
arizona
but
in
every
state
or
union.
i
think
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
but
the
state
of
arizona
is
not
duty
bound
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
pardon?
mr.
michael
s.
flam
they
eat
sir.
but
past
decisions
of
this
court
have
upheld
the
right
of
the
state
of
arizona
and
other
states.
i
shouldn’t
say
arizona
but
other
doctrines
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens.
what
we’re
trying
to
do
is
save
a
part
of
the
sinking
ship.
i
think
everybody
is
in
agreement
that
the
welfare
programs
in
the
united
states
and
that
every
state
in
the
union
are
in
serious
trouble
and
they
are
not
doing
their
job.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
approximately
--
i
believe
seven
or
eight
states
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
florida,
texas,
pennsylvania
--
they
spread
it
out.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it’s
not
specifically
the
southwest
or
close
states
which
border
canada.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
we
do
sir.
they
pay
sales
taxes,
income
taxes,
just
like
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct
but
it's
not
incumbent
upon
the
state
of
arizona,
once
a
person
comes
from
a
foreign
country
to
live
within
the
state,
to
maintain
his
existence,
i
don’t
think
we
could
find
that
under
the
constitution
or
any
statutory
scheme
of
congress
or
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
true
for
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
we
submit
based
upon
the
special
stay
interest
doctrine
which
has
been
announced
by
this
court
in
previous
decisions
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
the
right
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
its
welfare
programs.
i
cannot
over
emphasized
the
importance
we
rely
upon
in
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
wherein
this
court
has
stated
that
the
constitution
does
not
empower
this
court
to
second
guess
state
officials
charged
with
the
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
appellees
rely
heavily
upon
the
right
to
travel.
however,
they
do
not
show
or
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
that
right
extends
to
aliens.
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
that
right
was
the
reason,
primary
reason
why
citizens
who
had
to
wait
one
year
were
deprived
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
assuming
arguendo
that
the
right
to
travel
does
extend
to
aliens.
the
statutes
in
question
we
submit,
do
not
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
that
right.
for
one
thing,
indigency
alone
severely
limits
one’s
mobility.
another
fact
not
to
be
overlooked
is
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
national
residency
requirement.
we
do
not
require
an
alien
to
reside
in
the
state
of
arizona.
the
requirement
is
that
you
reside
in
the
united
states.
known
is
our
law
impede
free
movement
or
job
opportunities.
the
flaw
of
the
appellee's
position
can
be
shown
by
a
logical
extension
of
their
argument.
if
an
alien
is
residing
in
one
state
for
example,
new
mexico
and
wishes
to
move
to
another
state,
for
example
my
state,
arizona,
where
arizona’s
welfare
benefits
are
less
than
new
mexico’s,
can
he
compel
the
state
of
arizona
to
raise
its
benefits?i
think
not.
if
the
court
accepts
the
appellees’
position
as
tenable,
that
all
distinctions
affecting
aliens
and
citizens
would
be
suspect.
clearly,
this
has
not
been
the
wisdom
of
the
court
in
the
past.
furthermore,
arizona’s
citizenship
policy
is
articulated
by
the
social
security
act
which
does
not
forbid
states
from
favoring
citizens
over
aliens
in
the
distribution
of
welfare
benefits.
this
interpretation
is
bolstered
by
committee
report
of
the
congress
which
states,
“a
state
may
if
it
wishes
assist
only
those
who
are
citizens
but
must
not
insist
on
there
haven’t
been
born
citizens
or
on
there
having
been
naturalized
citizens
for
a
specified
period
of
time.”
further,
this
has
been
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
the
person
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
social
security
act.
the
arizona
citizenship
requirements,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
affect
three
federally
matched
programs.
the
old-age
assistance
program,
the
program
the
appellee
applied
for,
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
and
the
aid
to
the
blind
program.
there
is
one
state
program
involved
in
this
case
and
that’s
the
general
assistance
program
which
is
solely
funded
by
the
state
of
arizona.
one
more
point,
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
the
statutory
issue
of
42,
2000d.
this
statute
states
that
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
because
of
national
origin
under
a
program
which
is
financed
by
federal
funds.
arizona’s
citizenship
requirements
apply
to
all
aliens,
regardless
of
national
origin.
we
do
not
distinguish
between
germans
or
englishman
or
japanese.
and
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
lassiter
versus
north
hampton
board
of
elections,
a
statute
does
not
violate
equal
protection,
if
it’s
applied
equally.
in
that
case,
north
carolina’s
literacy
test
was
upheld
for
the
reason
it
applied
to
all
races
on
an
equal
basis.
one
other
point,
if
a
united
states
citizen,
who
has
not
resided
in
the
united
states
for
15
years,
was
expatriated
and
at
a
later
date
was
allowed
into
this
country,
he
too
would
not
be
eligible
for
welfare
assistance.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
none
to
my
recollection.
this
is
the
theory
which
i
desire
to
point
out
to
the
court.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
the
appellant
waives
rebuttal
unless
there’s
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
arizona’s
legislative
policy
which
requires
a
person
to
be
a
united
states’
citizen
or
in
lieu
of
united
states
citizenship,
a
resident
of
the
united
states
for
15
years
as
a
condition
for
obtaining
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
there
are
seven
other
states
that
have
similar
provisions.
briefly,
the
facts,
the
named
appellee
carmen
richardson
is
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
to
this
country
under
our
laws.
she
has
been
a
continuous
resident
of
the
state
of
arizona
for
13
years.
mrs.
richardson,
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
was
eligible
for
assistance
under
the
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
program
but
for
the
united
states
citizenship
requirement
for
in
lieu
of
u.s.
citizenship
to
15
years
to
national
residency
requirement.
appellee
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
citizenship
requirements.
it
claimed
in
(inaudible)
was
that
the
citizenship
requirements
violated
her
right
to
travel
and
denied
her
equal
protection
under
the
law
as
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
constitution.
she
also
alleged
two
statutory
grounds;
one
that
the
statute
violated
the
social
security
act;
and
two,
that
the
statute
violated
42
united
states
code
2000d.
the
district
court
after
hearing
enjoined
the
appellant
from
enforcing
that
united
states
citizenship
requirement
as
provided
by
arizona
law
and
there
after
upon
motion
of
the
appellant
state
judgment
pending
judicial
review
by
this
court.
we
would
first
like
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case
as
was
found
in
the
case
of
shapiro
v.
thompson.
all
the
state
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
create
two
classes
for
determining
who
shall
be
eligible
for
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
one
class
is
citizens,
the
other
are
aliens.
this
court,
by
prior
decisions
have
allowed
states
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
their
war
on
poverty.
specifically
we
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
people
v.
crane
wherein
justice
cardozo
stated
“to
disqualify
aliens
as
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.”
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
it
was
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
which
is
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
without
an
opinion.
but
his
opinion
in
the
lower
courts
is
very
instructive.
to
disqualify
aliens
is
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.
for
the
principle
of
exclusion
is
the
restriction
of
a
resources
to
the
state
to
the
advancement
and
profit
of
members
of
the
state.
ungenerous
and
unwise,
such
a
discrimination
maybe
is
not
for
that
reason
unlawful.
further,
last
term
this
court
decided
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams,
which
we
feel
is
very
instructive.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
in
the
area
of
economics
and
social
welfare,
the
state
does
not
violate
equal
protection
merely
because
the
classification
made
by
its
laws
were
imperfect.
if
the
classification
has
some
reasonable
basis,
it
does
not
offend
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
submit
the
state
does
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
favoring
u.s.
citizens
over
aliens.
funds
available
for
welfare
purposes
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
quite
limited.
for
example,
a
family
of
four
in
the
state
of
arizona
draw
an
adc,
the
maximum
payment
is
a
$167.00
a
month.
for
the
adult
program
such
as
the
one
the
appellee
applied
for
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no,
we
don’t
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
a
reasonable
basis,
i
think
what
i
like
to
equate
to
the
court
--
the
sums,
these
sums
are
barely
enough
to
sustain
life
for
the
persons
presently
participating
in
the
program.
now
to
further
dilute
the
funds
available
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
primary
reason.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that’s
a
reasonable
basis
in
light
of
the
decision
of
dandridge
v.
williams.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
it
was
enacted
approximately
in
1937.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
at
the
time
the
states
provided
for
welfare
assistance
and
received
funds
from
the
federal
government.
at
one
time,
the
residency
requirement
was
25
years,
that
i
believe
in
1956
it
was
lowered
to
the
present
15
year
limitation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
sir,
there’s
no
legislative
history
or
records.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
such,
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
to
conserve
funds,
right.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it
appears
that
--
you
know,
from
reading
the
statute,
that’s
the
purpose,
in
arizona,
funds
are
appropriate
on
an
annual
basis
for
welfare
and
they
cannot
be
increased
except
by
an
act
of
the
legislature.
so,
the
appellant
in
administering
the
welfare
programs
must
divide
the
funds
available
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
now,
by
adding
aliens
to
the
welfare
roles
would
dilute
the
funds
available
to
the
persons
presently
participating
and
as
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
sums
are
quite
low
and
to
add
two
to
3000
aliens
who
may
become
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
arizona
would
damage
their
program
tremendously.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes,
when
the
appellant
moved
for
a
stay
at
--
of
the
judgment
in
the
lower
court,
the
department
of
public
welfare
submitted
an
affidavit
by
their
director
of
assistance
payments
and
i
could
refer
to
court
to
page
53
of
the
appendix.
in
the
affidavit,
we
estimate
that
there
are
between
2600
and
3900
resident
aliens
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
of
course
some
of
those
people
have
met
the
15
year
residency
requirement,
so
that’s
why
we
have
the
2600
figure
and
the
high
figure
3900,
put
out
variation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
we
concede
that
most
of
the
resident
aliens
living
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
from
mexico.
however,
the
statute
applies
to
all
aliens
equally
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct,
it’s
a
national
residency
requirement
and
this
is
distinguishable
from
the
residency
requirement
that
was
stricken
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
recent
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
special
state
interest
doctrine
wherein
states
may
favor
citizens
over
aliens,
1948
case
of
takahashi
v.
fish
&
game
commission
which
is
much
discussed
in
the
briefs
uphold
that
provision.
however,
in
that
case,
this
court
could
not
find
that
the
state
of
california
had
a
special
state
interest
in
conserving
the
fish
off
its
coast.
i
think
one
thing
that
is
very
important
that
this
court
must
take
notice
of
that
the
states
are
experiencing
difficulty
in
their
welfare
programs.
specifically,
this
court
is
directed
to
the
problems
the
state
of
new
york
and
california
are
having.
the
city
of
new
york
went
bankrupt
several
weeks
ago
because
of
welfare
costs.
surely,
the
problem
is
plagued
by
these
states,
illustrates
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
well,
that’s
prerogative
of
the
state
legislature
and
we
do
have
a
problem
pertaining
to
welfare
not
only
in
the
state
of
arizona
but
in
every
state
or
union.
i
think
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
but
the
state
of
arizona
is
not
duty
bound
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
pardon?
mr.
michael
s.
flam
they
eat
sir.
but
past
decisions
of
this
court
have
upheld
the
right
of
the
state
of
arizona
and
other
states.
i
shouldn’t
say
arizona
but
other
doctrines
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens.
what
we’re
trying
to
do
is
save
a
part
of
the
sinking
ship.
i
think
everybody
is
in
agreement
that
the
welfare
programs
in
the
united
states
and
that
every
state
in
the
union
are
in
serious
trouble
and
they
are
not
doing
their
job.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
approximately
--
i
believe
seven
or
eight
states
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
florida,
texas,
pennsylvania
--
they
spread
it
out.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it’s
not
specifically
the
southwest
or
close
states
which
border
canada.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
we
do
sir.
they
pay
sales
taxes,
income
taxes,
just
like
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct
but
it's
not
incumbent
upon
the
state
of
arizona,
once
a
person
comes
from
a
foreign
country
to
live
within
the
state,
to
maintain
his
existence,
i
don’t
think
we
could
find
that
under
the
constitution
or
any
statutory
scheme
of
congress
or
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
true
for
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
we
submit
based
upon
the
special
stay
interest
doctrine
which
has
been
announced
by
this
court
in
previous
decisions
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
the
right
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
its
welfare
programs.
i
cannot
over
emphasized
the
importance
we
rely
upon
in
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
wherein
this
court
has
stated
that
the
constitution
does
not
empower
this
court
to
second
guess
state
officials
charged
with
the
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
appellees
rely
heavily
upon
the
right
to
travel.
however,
they
do
not
show
or
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
that
right
extends
to
aliens.
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
that
right
was
the
reason,
primary
reason
why
citizens
who
had
to
wait
one
year
were
deprived
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
assuming
arguendo
that
the
right
to
travel
does
extend
to
aliens.
the
statutes
in
question
we
submit,
do
not
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
that
right.
for
one
thing,
indigency
alone
severely
limits
one’s
mobility.
another
fact
not
to
be
overlooked
is
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
national
residency
requirement.
we
do
not
require
an
alien
to
reside
in
the
state
of
arizona.
the
requirement
is
that
you
reside
in
the
united
states.
known
is
our
law
impede
free
movement
or
job
opportunities.
the
flaw
of
the
appellee's
position
can
be
shown
by
a
logical
extension
of
their
argument.
if
an
alien
is
residing
in
one
state
for
example,
new
mexico
and
wishes
to
move
to
another
state,
for
example
my
state,
arizona,
where
arizona’s
welfare
benefits
are
less
than
new
mexico’s,
can
he
compel
the
state
of
arizona
to
raise
its
benefits?i
think
not.
if
the
court
accepts
the
appellees’
position
as
tenable,
that
all
distinctions
affecting
aliens
and
citizens
would
be
suspect.
clearly,
this
has
not
been
the
wisdom
of
the
court
in
the
past.
furthermore,
arizona’s
citizenship
policy
is
articulated
by
the
social
security
act
which
does
not
forbid
states
from
favoring
citizens
over
aliens
in
the
distribution
of
welfare
benefits.
this
interpretation
is
bolstered
by
committee
report
of
the
congress
which
states,
“a
state
may
if
it
wishes
assist
only
those
who
are
citizens
but
must
not
insist
on
there
haven’t
been
born
citizens
or
on
there
having
been
naturalized
citizens
for
a
specified
period
of
time.”
further,
this
has
been
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
the
person
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
social
security
act.
the
arizona
citizenship
requirements,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
affect
three
federally
matched
programs.
the
old-age
assistance
program,
the
program
the
appellee
applied
for,
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
and
the
aid
to
the
blind
program.
there
is
one
state
program
involved
in
this
case
and
that’s
the
general
assistance
program
which
is
solely
funded
by
the
state
of
arizona.
one
more
point,
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
the
statutory
issue
of
42,
2000d.
this
statute
states
that
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
because
of
national
origin
under
a
program
which
is
financed
by
federal
funds.
arizona’s
citizenship
requirements
apply
to
all
aliens,
regardless
of
national
origin.
we
do
not
distinguish
between
germans
or
englishman
or
japanese.
and
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
lassiter
versus
north
hampton
board
of
elections,
a
statute
does
not
violate
equal
protection,
if
it’s
applied
equally.
in
that
case,
north
carolina’s
literacy
test
was
upheld
for
the
reason
it
applied
to
all
races
on
an
equal
basis.
one
other
point,
if
a
united
states
citizen,
who
has
not
resided
in
the
united
states
for
15
years,
was
expatriated
and
at
a
later
date
was
allowed
into
this
country,
he
too
would
not
be
eligible
for
welfare
assistance.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
none
to
my
recollection.
this
is
the
theory
which
i
desire
to
point
out
to
the
court.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
the
appellant
waives
rebuttal
unless
there’s
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
arizona’s
legislative
policy
which
requires
a
person
to
be
a
united
states’
citizen
or
in
lieu
of
united
states
citizenship,
a
resident
of
the
united
states
for
15
years
as
a
condition
for
obtaining
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
there
are
seven
other
states
that
have
similar
provisions.
briefly,
the
facts,
the
named
appellee
carmen
richardson
is
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
to
this
country
under
our
laws.
she
has
been
a
continuous
resident
of
the
state
of
arizona
for
13
years.
mrs.
richardson,
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
was
eligible
for
assistance
under
the
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
program
but
for
the
united
states
citizenship
requirement
for
in
lieu
of
u.s.
citizenship
to
15
years
to
national
residency
requirement.
appellee
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
citizenship
requirements.
it
claimed
in
(inaudible)
was
that
the
citizenship
requirements
violated
her
right
to
travel
and
denied
her
equal
protection
under
the
law
as
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
constitution.
she
also
alleged
two
statutory
grounds;
one
that
the
statute
violated
the
social
security
act;
and
two,
that
the
statute
violated
42
united
states
code
2000d.
the
district
court
after
hearing
enjoined
the
appellant
from
enforcing
that
united
states
citizenship
requirement
as
provided
by
arizona
law
and
there
after
upon
motion
of
the
appellant
state
judgment
pending
judicial
review
by
this
court.
we
would
first
like
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case
as
was
found
in
the
case
of
shapiro
v.
thompson.
all
the
state
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
create
two
classes
for
determining
who
shall
be
eligible
for
welfare
benefits
in
the
state
of
arizona.
one
class
is
citizens,
the
other
are
aliens.
this
court,
by
prior
decisions
have
allowed
states
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
their
war
on
poverty.
specifically
we
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
people
v.
crane
wherein
justice
cardozo
stated
“to
disqualify
aliens
as
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.”
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
it
was
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
which
is
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
without
an
opinion.
but
his
opinion
in
the
lower
courts
is
very
instructive.
to
disqualify
aliens
is
discrimination
indeed
but
not
arbitrary
discrimination.
for
the
principle
of
exclusion
is
the
restriction
of
a
resources
to
the
state
to
the
advancement
and
profit
of
members
of
the
state.
ungenerous
and
unwise,
such
a
discrimination
maybe
is
not
for
that
reason
unlawful.
further,
last
term
this
court
decided
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams,
which
we
feel
is
very
instructive.
in
that
case,
this
court
stated
in
the
area
of
economics
and
social
welfare,
the
state
does
not
violate
equal
protection
merely
because
the
classification
made
by
its
laws
were
imperfect.
if
the
classification
has
some
reasonable
basis,
it
does
not
offend
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
submit
the
state
does
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
favoring
u.s.
citizens
over
aliens.
funds
available
for
welfare
purposes
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
quite
limited.
for
example,
a
family
of
four
in
the
state
of
arizona
draw
an
adc,
the
maximum
payment
is
a
$167.00
a
month.
for
the
adult
program
such
as
the
one
the
appellee
applied
for
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no,
we
don’t
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
a
reasonable
basis,
i
think
what
i
like
to
equate
to
the
court
--
the
sums,
these
sums
are
barely
enough
to
sustain
life
for
the
persons
presently
participating
in
the
program.
now
to
further
dilute
the
funds
available
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
primary
reason.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
i
would
say
that’s
a
reasonable
basis
in
light
of
the
decision
of
dandridge
v.
williams.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
sir,
it
was
enacted
approximately
in
1937.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
at
the
time
the
states
provided
for
welfare
assistance
and
received
funds
from
the
federal
government.
at
one
time,
the
residency
requirement
was
25
years,
that
i
believe
in
1956
it
was
lowered
to
the
present
15
year
limitation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
no
sir,
there’s
no
legislative
history
or
records.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
as
such,
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
to
conserve
funds,
right.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it
appears
that
--
you
know,
from
reading
the
statute,
that’s
the
purpose,
in
arizona,
funds
are
appropriate
on
an
annual
basis
for
welfare
and
they
cannot
be
increased
except
by
an
act
of
the
legislature.
so,
the
appellant
in
administering
the
welfare
programs
must
divide
the
funds
available
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
now,
by
adding
aliens
to
the
welfare
roles
would
dilute
the
funds
available
to
the
persons
presently
participating
and
as
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
sums
are
quite
low
and
to
add
two
to
3000
aliens
who
may
become
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
arizona
would
damage
their
program
tremendously.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes,
when
the
appellant
moved
for
a
stay
at
--
of
the
judgment
in
the
lower
court,
the
department
of
public
welfare
submitted
an
affidavit
by
their
director
of
assistance
payments
and
i
could
refer
to
court
to
page
53
of
the
appendix.
in
the
affidavit,
we
estimate
that
there
are
between
2600
and
3900
resident
aliens
eligible
for
welfare
assistance
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
of
course
some
of
those
people
have
met
the
15
year
residency
requirement,
so
that’s
why
we
have
the
2600
figure
and
the
high
figure
3900,
put
out
variation.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
we
concede
that
most
of
the
resident
aliens
living
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
from
mexico.
however,
the
statute
applies
to
all
aliens
equally
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct,
it’s
a
national
residency
requirement
and
this
is
distinguishable
from
the
residency
requirement
that
was
stricken
by
this
court
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
recent
decisions
of
this
court
uphold
special
state
interest
doctrine
wherein
states
may
favor
citizens
over
aliens,
1948
case
of
takahashi
v.
fish
&
game
commission
which
is
much
discussed
in
the
briefs
uphold
that
provision.
however,
in
that
case,
this
court
could
not
find
that
the
state
of
california
had
a
special
state
interest
in
conserving
the
fish
off
its
coast.
i
think
one
thing
that
is
very
important
that
this
court
must
take
notice
of
that
the
states
are
experiencing
difficulty
in
their
welfare
programs.
specifically,
this
court
is
directed
to
the
problems
the
state
of
new
york
and
california
are
having.
the
city
of
new
york
went
bankrupt
several
weeks
ago
because
of
welfare
costs.
surely,
the
problem
is
plagued
by
these
states,
illustrates
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
well,
that’s
prerogative
of
the
state
legislature
and
we
do
have
a
problem
pertaining
to
welfare
not
only
in
the
state
of
arizona
but
in
every
state
or
union.
i
think
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
but
the
state
of
arizona
is
not
duty
bound
--
mr.
michael
s.
flam
pardon?
mr.
michael
s.
flam
they
eat
sir.
but
past
decisions
of
this
court
have
upheld
the
right
of
the
state
of
arizona
and
other
states.
i
shouldn’t
say
arizona
but
other
doctrines
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens.
what
we’re
trying
to
do
is
save
a
part
of
the
sinking
ship.
i
think
everybody
is
in
agreement
that
the
welfare
programs
in
the
united
states
and
that
every
state
in
the
union
are
in
serious
trouble
and
they
are
not
doing
their
job.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
approximately
--
i
believe
seven
or
eight
states
sir.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
florida,
texas,
pennsylvania
--
they
spread
it
out.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
it’s
not
specifically
the
southwest
or
close
states
which
border
canada.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
yes
we
do
sir.
they
pay
sales
taxes,
income
taxes,
just
like
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct
but
it's
not
incumbent
upon
the
state
of
arizona,
once
a
person
comes
from
a
foreign
country
to
live
within
the
state,
to
maintain
his
existence,
i
don’t
think
we
could
find
that
under
the
constitution
or
any
statutory
scheme
of
congress
or
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that’s
true
for
citizens.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
that
is
correct.
we
submit
based
upon
the
special
stay
interest
doctrine
which
has
been
announced
by
this
court
in
previous
decisions
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
the
right
to
favor
citizens
over
aliens
in
its
welfare
programs.
i
cannot
over
emphasized
the
importance
we
rely
upon
in
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
wherein
this
court
has
stated
that
the
constitution
does
not
empower
this
court
to
second
guess
state
officials
charged
with
the
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
limited
public
welfare
funds
amongst
the
myriad
of
potential
recipients.
appellees
rely
heavily
upon
the
right
to
travel.
however,
they
do
not
show
or
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
that
right
extends
to
aliens.
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
that
right
was
the
reason,
primary
reason
why
citizens
who
had
to
wait
one
year
were
deprived
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
assuming
arguendo
that
the
right
to
travel
does
extend
to
aliens.
the
statutes
in
question
we
submit,
do
not
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
that
right.
for
one
thing,
indigency
alone
severely
limits
one’s
mobility.
another
fact
not
to
be
overlooked
is
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
national
residency
requirement.
we
do
not
require
an
alien
to
reside
in
the
state
of
arizona.
the
requirement
is
that
you
reside
in
the
united
states.
known
is
our
law
impede
free
movement
or
job
opportunities.
the
flaw
of
the
appellee's
position
can
be
shown
by
a
logical
extension
of
their
argument.
if
an
alien
is
residing
in
one
state
for
example,
new
mexico
and
wishes
to
move
to
another
state,
for
example
my
state,
arizona,
where
arizona’s
welfare
benefits
are
less
than
new
mexico’s,
can
he
compel
the
state
of
arizona
to
raise
its
benefits?i
think
not.
if
the
court
accepts
the
appellees’
position
as
tenable,
that
all
distinctions
affecting
aliens
and
citizens
would
be
suspect.
clearly,
this
has
not
been
the
wisdom
of
the
court
in
the
past.
furthermore,
arizona’s
citizenship
policy
is
articulated
by
the
social
security
act
which
does
not
forbid
states
from
favoring
citizens
over
aliens
in
the
distribution
of
welfare
benefits.
this
interpretation
is
bolstered
by
committee
report
of
the
congress
which
states,
“a
state
may
if
it
wishes
assist
only
those
who
are
citizens
but
must
not
insist
on
there
haven’t
been
born
citizens
or
on
there
having
been
naturalized
citizens
for
a
specified
period
of
time.”
further,
this
has
been
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
the
person
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
social
security
act.
the
arizona
citizenship
requirements,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
affect
three
federally
matched
programs.
the
old-age
assistance
program,
the
program
the
appellee
applied
for,
aid
to
the
permanently
and
totally
disabled
and
the
aid
to
the
blind
program.
there
is
one
state
program
involved
in
this
case
and
that’s
the
general
assistance
program
which
is
solely
funded
by
the
state
of
arizona.
one
more
point,
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
the
statutory
issue
of
42,
2000d.
this
statute
states
that
no
person
shall
be
discriminated
because
of
national
origin
under
a
program
which
is
financed
by
federal
funds.
arizona’s
citizenship
requirements
apply
to
all
aliens,
regardless
of
national
origin.
we
do
not
distinguish
between
germans
or
englishman
or
japanese.
and
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
lassiter
versus
north
hampton
board
of
elections,
a
statute
does
not
violate
equal
protection,
if
it’s
applied
equally.
in
that
case,
north
carolina’s
literacy
test
was
upheld
for
the
reason
it
applied
to
all
races
on
an
equal
basis.
one
other
point,
if
a
united
states
citizen,
who
has
not
resided
in
the
united
states
for
15
years,
was
expatriated
and
at
a
later
date
was
allowed
into
this
country,
he
too
would
not
be
eligible
for
welfare
assistance.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
none
to
my
recollection.
this
is
the
theory
which
i
desire
to
point
out
to
the
court.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
michael
s.
flam
the
appellant
waives
rebuttal
unless
there’s
questions
from
the
court.
