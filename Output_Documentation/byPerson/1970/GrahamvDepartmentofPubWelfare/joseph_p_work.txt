mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
moved
for
a
leave
to
permit
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein,
a
member
of
the
pennsylvania
bar
to
argue
pro
hac
vice
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
thank
your
honor.
your
honors,
this
case
comes
before
you
on
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court
convened
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
decision
of
which
court
was
rendered
on
july
13,
1970
and
which
decision
held
section
432
(2)
of
the
pennsylvania
welfare
code
unconstitutional.
and
that
in
denying
general
assistance
to
aliens
who
are
residents
of
the
commonwealth,
it
violated
the
precepts
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fact
to
the
case
your
honor
is
relevantly
simple.
the
appellee,
elsie
mary
jane
leger
immigrated
to
this
country
from
scotland
on
may
18,
1965,
and
undertook
employment
for
which
she
remained
a
period
of
four
years.
she
applied
for
general
assistance
together
with
her
common-law
husband
shortly
prior
to
december
9,
1969
and
she
was
denied
assistance
at
that
time
solely
on
the
ground
that
she
was
an
alien.
she
commenced
her
action
in
the
federal
district
court
on
december
9,
1969.
the
court
subsequently
permitted
amendment
of
the
action
to
add
mrs.
jervis
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
to
permit
the
action
to
continue
as
a
class
action.
mrs.
beryl
jervis
who
is
the
other
party
plaintiff
to
this
action
immigrated
to
united
states
from
panama
on
march
1,
1968.
and
after
working
for
two
years,
ceased
her
employment
because
of
illness
and
applied
for
assistance.
she
too
was
denied
assistance
solely
on
the
basis
of
our
statute
which
prohibits
the
dispensing
of
assistance
to
aliens.
i
perhaps
said
that
wrong,
it
doesn’t
prohibit,
it
doesn't
provide
for
it.
presently,
there
are
two
assistance
programs
in
pennsylvania.
one
of
course
is
the
categorical
assistance
which
provides
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
aged,
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
and
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
these
are
all
federally
supported
categories
of
assistance
from
which
receive
slightly
over
one
half
of
the
funds
from
the
federal
government.
neither
of
the
named
parties
here
would
have
qualified
for
any
of
the
federal
assistance
categories.
the
other
assistance
program
which
we
have
in
pennsylvania
is
our
so-called
general
assistance
program
which
is
wholly
state
financed
and
which
provides
aid
for
all
other
persons
who
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
whom
no
aid
is
provided
under
the
categorical
assistance
programs.
i’m
going
to
be
completely
frank
with
this
court
as
i
was
with
the
lower
court
and
state
that
there
is
no
question
for
what
the
statute
draws
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens,
and
if,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
has
been
overruled,
sub
silentio
as
the
lower
court
found
that
it
was,
then
i
am
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
task
indeed
in
justifying
the
distinction.
however,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
for
a
few
short
moments,
i
should
like
to
discuss
just
briefly
the
two
cases
by
which
the
lower
court
found
that
this
court
had
overruled
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
the
first
of
these
of
course
is
a
truax
case
which
involved
the
employment
or
the
failure
to
employ
a
person
as
a
cook
in
the
state
of
arizona
because
of
the
fact
that
the
arizona
statute
provided
that
employment
had
to
be
80%
citizen,
just
as
used
in
that
case
however
specifically
noted
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
an
exception
to
the
ordinary
test
of
discrimination.
he
stated,
“this
discrimination
defined
by
the
act
does
not
pertain
to
the
regulation
or
distribution
of
the
public
domain
or
of
common
property
resources
or
the
people
of
the
state.
the
enjoinment
of
which
may
be
limited
to
citizens
as
it
begins
to
both,
as
against
both
aliens
and
citizens
of
other
states.”
we
of
course
admit
immediately
your
honors
that
we
realize
that
this
doctrine
has
been
somewhat
changed
by
your
decision
in
the
shapiro
case,
with
respect
at
least
to
citizens
of
other
states.
we
do
submit
however
that
it
retains
full
vitality
insofar
as
its
application
to
aliens
is
concerned.
32
years
later,
in
the
takahashi
case,
this
court
also
said
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
still
in
existence.
although
this
court
specifically
denied
the
claim
that
the
preservation
of
fish
within
its
three-mile
border
was
a
special
public
interest
to
the
state
of
california.
one
thing,
i
think
however
your
honors
is
very
imported
to
note
in
the
takahashi
case
and
that
is
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly,
the
statute
there
also
discriminated
among
aliens
and
that
those
who
would
have
been
denied
the
right
to
apply
for
the
fishing
permit
would
have
been
those
who
weren’t
ineligible
for
citizenship
in
the
united
states
and
therefore,
it
would
have
applied
only
to
orientals.
while
the
court
did
not
make
a
great
deal
of
this
fact,
i
do
think
it
is
a
very
important
distinction
between
that
case
and
the
case
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
finally
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
your
honor
that
we
have
agreed
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
aliens
with
of
course
the
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions.
but
if
it
does
apply
in
equal
protection,
it
would
therefore
follow
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens
because
its
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions
are
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
in
our
particular
case
here,
it
applies
regardless
of
origin.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
it
certainly
should
your
honor
because
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
at
all,
it
would
certainly
apply
to
say
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
really
think
that
it
would
go
beyond
that
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
a
compelling
state
would
justify
particular
--
i
mean
under
the
language
of
this
court
dandridge
versus
williams,
i
rather
doubt
that
there
could
be
a
compelling
state
interest
which
would
justify
discrimination
among
aliens,
between
one
class
of
aliens
and
another
class.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
finally,
this
court
has
intimated,
i
submit
in
those
cases
such
as
takahashi
and
truax
that
the
cases
involved
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
courts
have
gone
one
step
further
and
said
that
this
--
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
as
granted
to
aliens
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
would
meaningless
if
they
didn’t
have
the
right
to
employment.
and
i
for
one
your
honors
i’m
just
old
fashioned
enough
to
believe
that
there
is
still
a
distinction
in
our
law
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
accept
your
honor’s
statement
completely
and
i
think
if
i
may
at
this
time
just
by
departing
a
little
bit
refer
to
a
question
which
this
honor
asked
in
the
previous
case,
i
think
in
that
respect
your
honor
we
get
to
a
question
of
responsibility.
and
whose
responsibility
it
is.
and
of
course,
i’m
getting
a
little
ahead
in
my
argument,
but
if
the
federal
government
has
the
complete
right
to
regulate
aliens
then
of
course,
i
must
answer
your
honor
that
the
responsibility
for
these
persons,
if
it
lies
anywhere,
lies
with
the
federal
government
and
not
with
the
states.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
record
does
disclose
that
both
of
them
paid
at
least
sales
taxes
and
income
taxes
within
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
four
years,
yes
your
honor,
the
second
one
for
two.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
interest
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
complete
frank
answer
is
the
conversation
of
assets
for
its
citizen.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
saving
may
i
say,
due
the
fact
perhaps
that
we
can
serve
assets
for
our
citizens,
we
were
recently
able
to
go
to
a
100%
of
the
federal
level.
had
we
granted
to
aliens,
i’m
not
saying
we
couldn’t
have,
there’s
a
possibility
perhaps
we
couldn’t
have
gone
to
that
100%.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
just
to
the
--
completely
state
financed
general
assistance
program.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
absolutely
nothing
your
honor.
we
do
by
the
way
for
the
court’s
information,
we
do
in
our
federal
category,
we
do
grant
assistance
to
aliens
under
all
the
federal
categories.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
quite
honestly
your
honor,
it
was
a
mistake.
the
department
of
welfare
felt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no,
the
mistake
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
when
the
federal
statute
first
come
out,
our
department
felt
that
they
were
required
by
that
statute
to
grant
assist
under
the
federal
categories.
that
appears
in
the
transcript
to
the
hearing
in
the
lower
courts
your
honor.
preview
the
second
phase
of
the
appellee’s
argument
which
of
course
was
a
contention
which
was
not
important
in
the
lower
court’s
decision
but
it
was
alluded
to
there
and
of
course
is
raised
again
before
this
court
on
appeal
and
that
is
the
alien’s
right
to
travel
for
which
position
the
appellees
placed
great
reliance
on
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro
versus
thompson.
my
understanding
of
that
decision
your
honors
is
the
fact
that
this
court
found
that
the
right
of
citizens
to
travel
derives
from
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
union
itself.
the
court
did
not,
however,
according
to
my
understanding
of
that
case,
say
that
the
right
was
derived
solely
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
of
course
has
been
conceded
applies
equally
to
aliens
except
for
the
judicially
created
exception
which
we
are
advancing
to
this
court
at
this
time
which
is
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
we
would
further
point
out
your
honors
that
the
right
to
enter
and
abide,
we
feel
by
virtue
of
decisions
of
this
court
are
not
on
the
same
footing
as
the
citizen’s
right
to
travel.
the
truax
case
for
example,
this
court
noted
that
the
alien’s
right
to
enter
and
abide
stemmed
from
federal
law
and
not
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
such
right
might
therefore
be
retracted
by
federal
statute.
it
would
seem
to
follow
therefore
that
an
infringement
on
his
right
which
we
would
deny
as
brought
about
by
the
statue
here
in
question
might
be
invalid
under
the
federal
statute.
it
might
be
invalid
by
the
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause.
but
it
certainly
would
not
be
invalid
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
equal
protection
clause.
we
come
therefore
to
the
final
issue
raised
by
the
brief
and
that
is
whether
this
statute
in
pennsylvania
is
an
obstruction
of
federal
law
dealing
with
immigration
and
naturalization
or
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
regulate
aliens.
we
concede
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hines
versus
davidowitz,
the
state
can
only
do
this
within
very
narrow
limits.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
regulate
--
any
regulation
your
honor
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hines
case
must
be
construed
very,
very
strictly
and
within
very
narrow
limits.
however,
as
judge
wood
appropriately
noted
in
his
dissent
in
the
lower
court,
if
pennsylvania
had
no
general
assistance
program
at
all,
federal
laws
dealing
with
aliens
would
not
be
obstructed.
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
see
how
federal
laws
are
anymore
obstructed
because
the
state
decides
to
give
welfare
payments
to
its
citizens.
furthermore,
insofar
as
attempting
to
regulate
aliens
is
concerned,
how
can
a
statute
which
grants
assistance
to
citizens
be
said
to
regulate
aliens
anymore
than
a
statute
which
would
grant
assistance
to
person
over
65
can
be
said
to
be
regulating
persons
under
65
and
to
take
it
one
step
further,
let
us
assume
that
the
statute
grants
assistance
to
all
persons
over
65,
alien
or
citizen.
can
an
alien
then
come
in
and
challenge
the
statute
as
being
discriminatory
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
because
it
attempts
to
regulate
him.
we
respectfully
submit
to
state
that
proposition
indicates
its
absurdity.
appellee,
in
their
brief
assert
that
the
state's
denial
of
general
assistance
to
aliens
may
have
some
effect
on
the
decision
of
an
alien
to
settle
in
pennsylvania
or
it
may
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
of
course
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
pennsylvania’s
6%
sales
tax
or
its
liquor
tax
which
is
the
second
highest
in
the
nation,
or
its
cigarettes
tax
which
is
also
somewhere
near
the
highest.
no
one
we
submit,
however,
your
honors
would
seriously
contend
that
these
statutes
are
invalid
as
an
attempt
to
regulate
aliens
because
they
might
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
your
honor
except
that
as
i
understand
the
appellee’s
argument.
the
test
that
they
are
trying
to
assert
to
ask
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
are
violating
the
supremacy
clause
in
regulating
aliens
is
whether
or
not
this
statute
does
have
some
effect
on
their
decision
to
locate
elsewhere
or
not
to
locate
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and
any
of
these
thing
could
certainly
have
an
effect
on
that
decision.
we
would
also
submit
your
honors
that
because
of
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
scheme
of
intent
which
is
indicated
by
that
statute
and
their
requirement
that
aliens
entering
this
country
be
able
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
earn
a
livelihood.
we
sincerely
doubt
that
this
factor
has
given
much
if
any
consideration
at
the
time
of
entry.
that
is
the
factor
of
whether
or
not
pennsylvania
grants
assistance
to
aliens
or
not.
and
finally
your
honors
i
would
point
out
and
i
think
it
came
up
in
the
arizona
argument,
the
federal
statute
do
not
impose
any
duty
on
the
states
to
provide
assistance
to
aliens.
in
fact,
even
in
the
federal
assistance
categories,
the
statute
leaves
it
open
to
the
states
and
would
not
cause
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
to
hold
a
state
plan
invalid
where
it
does
discriminate
against
the
aliens.
we
would
further
submit
in
this
regard
that
the
statutory
intent
and
scheme
as
set
forth
in
the
federal
statute
on
immigration
and
naturalization
particularly
in
8
u.s.c.
1182
(a)
--
1182-87,
1182-8,
1182-15,
1183
and
1251
would
lead
one
to
presume
that
the
congressional
intent
was
to
relieve
both
the
states
and
the
federal
government
of
the
burden
of
aliens
who
were
or
who
might
become
public
charges.
we
submit
therefore
that
it’s
difficult
to
see
how
the
state’s
decision
to
grant
an
affirmant
of
benefit
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
residing
in
pennsylvania
conflicts
with
this
scheme
of
federal
regulation
of
aliens.
we
had
an
allegation
which
i
think
your
honors
that
i
have
to
systematically
respond
to
in
the
brief
and
that
was
that
this
statute
according
to
the
appellee’s
position
was
enacted
as
result
of
war
hysteria.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lower
court
transcript
which
the
court
has
before
it.
there
is
only
one
minute
quantity
of
proof
and
which
was
submitted
as
a
one
man’s
opinion
in
writing
on
the
scheme
of
assistance
in
pennsylvania
which
said
that
this
was
enacted
as
a
result
of
war
hysteria.
there
is
absolutely
no
legislative
history
to
support
that
assertion.
there
is
absolutely
no
other
credible
evidence
to
support
the
charge,
except
the
opinion
of
the
one
author.
we
submit
your
honors
that
it
is
just
as
logical
and
more
in
keeping
with
the
presumption
that
the
legislature
has
a
proper
motive
in
enacting
legislation
to
assume
that
after
the
enactment
of
the
federal
social
security
law
in
1935
and
after
four
years
of
trial
and
error
basis,
the
states
could
see
a
vast
area
of
persons
who
were
not
encompassed
within
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
and
they
enacted
a
general
assistance
statute
to
take
care
of
these
particular
persons.
we
would
not
say
that
they
did
not
at
that
time
have
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
much
in
mind
when
they
did
not
provide
for
aliens
under
that
same
scheme.
in
summary
therefore
your
honors,
we
would
submit
and
we
will
admit
that
these
laws
which
create
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens
which
have
evolved
in
the
formulation
of
the
special
public
interest
rule
are
based
upon
the
assumption
that
aliens
hold
allegiance
to
foreign
nations.
we
respectfully
submit,
however,
that
if
the
court
is
ready
to
say
that
this
distinction
violates
the
precepts
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
would
also
submit
that
this
court
may
in
the
very
near
future
be
ready
to
say
that
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
and
the
denial
of
the
right
to
hold
public
office
are
also
rights
which
may
not
be
denied
to
aliens
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
did
they
say
what
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
in
the
takahashi
case,
the
court
specifically
noted
that
there
was
such
a
doctrine,
as
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
they
denied
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no
your
honor
for
the
reason
that
i
expressed
before
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
pardon?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right
your
honor.
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
i
think
the
court
has
specifically
said
and
has
spelled
out
quite
completely
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
a
state
may
attempt
to
deny
a
person’s
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
yes.
i
still
submit
there's
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
to
the
extent
your
honor
that
the
crane
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
was
the
first
real
annunciation
of
the
so-called
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
heim
versus
mccall,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor,
they
did.
i
agree
completely
your
honor
that
this
court
has
certainly
by
its
later
decisions
said
that
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
may
not
be
denied.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
agree
your
honors,
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
you
mean
different
from
others,
from
citizens
your
honor?
no,
i
don’t
think
you
could
because
that
again
would
be
an
attempting
to
regulate
his
right
to
earn
a
living.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
believe
you’re
right
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
again,
i
think
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine,
if
it
has
vitality
today
which
i
submit
that
it
still
does,
it
has
been
at
least
watered
down
to
use
the
term
by
this
court
to
the
extent
that
if
it
involves
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
this
court
has
said
that
as
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rights
granted
to
enter
and
abide.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
would
presumably
be
so
your
honor
for
the
same
reasons,
i
may
submit
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
hold
public
office.
those
taxes
which
the
alien
pays
goes
to
all
public
elections.
they
go
to
print
the
ballots
upon
which
the
elections
are
held.
they
go
to
pay
the
office
holders
who
are
elected
to
those
offices.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
beg
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
not
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
is,
however,
the
logical
extension
of
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
presume
you
could
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
nothing
further
but
if
the
court
have
some
specific
questions.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
find
nothing
in
the
amendment
itself
your
honor
which
drives
that
distinction.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
that
there
is
some
difference,
however
your
honor
if
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
correctly
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
with
my
understanding
that
this
court
had
already
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
did
apply
to
aliens
as
well
as
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
the
only
distinction
that
i
see
your
honor
and
as
i
stated
in
the
beginning,
my
whole
position
in
being
here
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
the
overall
applicability
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
one
of
them
being
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
the
state
has
the
right
in
the
conservation
of
its
assets
for
its
own
citizens
to
draw
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
fully
appreciate
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
in
all
humility
say
to
his
honor
that
if
i
were
deciding
the
case
at
this
time
perhaps,
i
would
decide
it
differently.
but
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
they
have
said
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
that
specific
thing.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
but
only
as
to
aliens
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
not
drawn
a
distinction,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
moved
for
a
leave
to
permit
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein,
a
member
of
the
pennsylvania
bar
to
argue
pro
hac
vice
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
thank
your
honor.
your
honors,
this
case
comes
before
you
on
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court
convened
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
decision
of
which
court
was
rendered
on
july
13,
1970
and
which
decision
held
section
432
(2)
of
the
pennsylvania
welfare
code
unconstitutional.
and
that
in
denying
general
assistance
to
aliens
who
are
residents
of
the
commonwealth,
it
violated
the
precepts
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fact
to
the
case
your
honor
is
relevantly
simple.
the
appellee,
elsie
mary
jane
leger
immigrated
to
this
country
from
scotland
on
may
18,
1965,
and
undertook
employment
for
which
she
remained
a
period
of
four
years.
she
applied
for
general
assistance
together
with
her
common-law
husband
shortly
prior
to
december
9,
1969
and
she
was
denied
assistance
at
that
time
solely
on
the
ground
that
she
was
an
alien.
she
commenced
her
action
in
the
federal
district
court
on
december
9,
1969.
the
court
subsequently
permitted
amendment
of
the
action
to
add
mrs.
jervis
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
to
permit
the
action
to
continue
as
a
class
action.
mrs.
beryl
jervis
who
is
the
other
party
plaintiff
to
this
action
immigrated
to
united
states
from
panama
on
march
1,
1968.
and
after
working
for
two
years,
ceased
her
employment
because
of
illness
and
applied
for
assistance.
she
too
was
denied
assistance
solely
on
the
basis
of
our
statute
which
prohibits
the
dispensing
of
assistance
to
aliens.
i
perhaps
said
that
wrong,
it
doesn’t
prohibit,
it
doesn't
provide
for
it.
presently,
there
are
two
assistance
programs
in
pennsylvania.
one
of
course
is
the
categorical
assistance
which
provides
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
aged,
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
and
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
these
are
all
federally
supported
categories
of
assistance
from
which
receive
slightly
over
one
half
of
the
funds
from
the
federal
government.
neither
of
the
named
parties
here
would
have
qualified
for
any
of
the
federal
assistance
categories.
the
other
assistance
program
which
we
have
in
pennsylvania
is
our
so-called
general
assistance
program
which
is
wholly
state
financed
and
which
provides
aid
for
all
other
persons
who
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
whom
no
aid
is
provided
under
the
categorical
assistance
programs.
i’m
going
to
be
completely
frank
with
this
court
as
i
was
with
the
lower
court
and
state
that
there
is
no
question
for
what
the
statute
draws
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens,
and
if,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
has
been
overruled,
sub
silentio
as
the
lower
court
found
that
it
was,
then
i
am
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
task
indeed
in
justifying
the
distinction.
however,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
for
a
few
short
moments,
i
should
like
to
discuss
just
briefly
the
two
cases
by
which
the
lower
court
found
that
this
court
had
overruled
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
the
first
of
these
of
course
is
a
truax
case
which
involved
the
employment
or
the
failure
to
employ
a
person
as
a
cook
in
the
state
of
arizona
because
of
the
fact
that
the
arizona
statute
provided
that
employment
had
to
be
80%
citizen,
just
as
used
in
that
case
however
specifically
noted
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
an
exception
to
the
ordinary
test
of
discrimination.
he
stated,
“this
discrimination
defined
by
the
act
does
not
pertain
to
the
regulation
or
distribution
of
the
public
domain
or
of
common
property
resources
or
the
people
of
the
state.
the
enjoinment
of
which
may
be
limited
to
citizens
as
it
begins
to
both,
as
against
both
aliens
and
citizens
of
other
states.”
we
of
course
admit
immediately
your
honors
that
we
realize
that
this
doctrine
has
been
somewhat
changed
by
your
decision
in
the
shapiro
case,
with
respect
at
least
to
citizens
of
other
states.
we
do
submit
however
that
it
retains
full
vitality
insofar
as
its
application
to
aliens
is
concerned.
32
years
later,
in
the
takahashi
case,
this
court
also
said
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
still
in
existence.
although
this
court
specifically
denied
the
claim
that
the
preservation
of
fish
within
its
three-mile
border
was
a
special
public
interest
to
the
state
of
california.
one
thing,
i
think
however
your
honors
is
very
imported
to
note
in
the
takahashi
case
and
that
is
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly,
the
statute
there
also
discriminated
among
aliens
and
that
those
who
would
have
been
denied
the
right
to
apply
for
the
fishing
permit
would
have
been
those
who
weren’t
ineligible
for
citizenship
in
the
united
states
and
therefore,
it
would
have
applied
only
to
orientals.
while
the
court
did
not
make
a
great
deal
of
this
fact,
i
do
think
it
is
a
very
important
distinction
between
that
case
and
the
case
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
finally
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
your
honor
that
we
have
agreed
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
aliens
with
of
course
the
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions.
but
if
it
does
apply
in
equal
protection,
it
would
therefore
follow
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens
because
its
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions
are
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
in
our
particular
case
here,
it
applies
regardless
of
origin.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
it
certainly
should
your
honor
because
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
at
all,
it
would
certainly
apply
to
say
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
really
think
that
it
would
go
beyond
that
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
a
compelling
state
would
justify
particular
--
i
mean
under
the
language
of
this
court
dandridge
versus
williams,
i
rather
doubt
that
there
could
be
a
compelling
state
interest
which
would
justify
discrimination
among
aliens,
between
one
class
of
aliens
and
another
class.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
finally,
this
court
has
intimated,
i
submit
in
those
cases
such
as
takahashi
and
truax
that
the
cases
involved
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
courts
have
gone
one
step
further
and
said
that
this
--
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
as
granted
to
aliens
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
would
meaningless
if
they
didn’t
have
the
right
to
employment.
and
i
for
one
your
honors
i’m
just
old
fashioned
enough
to
believe
that
there
is
still
a
distinction
in
our
law
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
accept
your
honor’s
statement
completely
and
i
think
if
i
may
at
this
time
just
by
departing
a
little
bit
refer
to
a
question
which
this
honor
asked
in
the
previous
case,
i
think
in
that
respect
your
honor
we
get
to
a
question
of
responsibility.
and
whose
responsibility
it
is.
and
of
course,
i’m
getting
a
little
ahead
in
my
argument,
but
if
the
federal
government
has
the
complete
right
to
regulate
aliens
then
of
course,
i
must
answer
your
honor
that
the
responsibility
for
these
persons,
if
it
lies
anywhere,
lies
with
the
federal
government
and
not
with
the
states.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
record
does
disclose
that
both
of
them
paid
at
least
sales
taxes
and
income
taxes
within
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
four
years,
yes
your
honor,
the
second
one
for
two.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
interest
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
complete
frank
answer
is
the
conversation
of
assets
for
its
citizen.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
saving
may
i
say,
due
the
fact
perhaps
that
we
can
serve
assets
for
our
citizens,
we
were
recently
able
to
go
to
a
100%
of
the
federal
level.
had
we
granted
to
aliens,
i’m
not
saying
we
couldn’t
have,
there’s
a
possibility
perhaps
we
couldn’t
have
gone
to
that
100%.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
just
to
the
--
completely
state
financed
general
assistance
program.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
absolutely
nothing
your
honor.
we
do
by
the
way
for
the
court’s
information,
we
do
in
our
federal
category,
we
do
grant
assistance
to
aliens
under
all
the
federal
categories.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
quite
honestly
your
honor,
it
was
a
mistake.
the
department
of
welfare
felt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no,
the
mistake
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
when
the
federal
statute
first
come
out,
our
department
felt
that
they
were
required
by
that
statute
to
grant
assist
under
the
federal
categories.
that
appears
in
the
transcript
to
the
hearing
in
the
lower
courts
your
honor.

phase
of
the
appellee’s
argument
which
of
course
was
a
contention
which
was
not
important
in
the
lower
court’s
decision
but
it
was
alluded
to
there
and
of
course
is
raised
again
before
this
court
on
appeal
and
that
is
the
alien’s
right
to
travel
for
which
position
the
appellees
placed
great
reliance
on
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro
versus
thompson.
my
understanding
of
that
decision
your
honors
is
the
fact
that
this
court
found
that
the
right
of
citizens
to
travel
derives
from
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
union
itself.
the
court
did
not,
however,
according
to
my
understanding
of
that
case,
say
that
the
right
was
derived
solely
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
of
course
has
been
conceded
applies
equally
to
aliens
except
for
the
judicially
created
exception
which
we
are
advancing
to
this
court
at
this
time
which
is
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
we
would
further
point
out
your
honors
that
the
right
to
enter
and
abide,
we
feel
by
virtue
of
decisions
of
this
court
are
not
on
the
same
footing
as
the
citizen’s
right
to
travel.
the
truax
case
for
example,
this
court
noted
that
the
alien’s
right
to
enter
and
abide
stemmed
from
federal
law
and
not
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
such
right
might
therefore
be
retracted
by
federal
statute.
it
would
seem
to
follow
therefore
that
an
infringement
on
his
right
which
we
would
deny
as
brought
about
by
the
statue
here
in
question
might
be
invalid
under
the
federal
statute.
it
might
be
invalid
by
the
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause.
but
it
certainly
would
not
be
invalid
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
equal
protection
clause.
we
come
therefore
to
the
final
issue
raised
by
the
brief
and
that
is
whether
this
statute
in
pennsylvania
is
an
obstruction
of
federal
law
dealing
with
immigration
and
naturalization
or
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
regulate
aliens.
we
concede
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hines
versus
davidowitz,
the
state
can
only
do
this
within
very
narrow
limits.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
regulate
--
any
regulation
your
honor
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hines
case
must
be
construed
very,
very
strictly
and
within
very
narrow
limits.
however,
as
judge
wood
appropriately
noted
in
his
dissent
in
the
lower
court,
if
pennsylvania
had
no
general
assistance
program
at
all,
federal
laws
dealing
with
aliens
would
not
be
obstructed.
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
see
how
federal
laws
are
anymore
obstructed
because
the
state
decides
to
give
welfare
payments
to
its
citizens.
furthermore,
insofar
as
attempting
to
regulate
aliens
is
concerned,
how
can
a
statute
which
grants
assistance
to
citizens
be
said
to
regulate
aliens
anymore
than
a
statute
which
would
grant
assistance
to
person
over
65
can
be
said
to
be
regulating
persons
under
65
and
to
take
it
one
step
further,
let
us
assume
that
the
statute
grants
assistance
to
all
persons
over
65,
alien
or
citizen.
can
an
alien
then
come
in
and
challenge
the
statute
as
being
discriminatory
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
because
it
attempts
to
regulate
him.
we
respectfully
submit
to
state
that
proposition
indicates
its
absurdity.
appellee,
in
their
brief
assert
that
the
state's
denial
of
general
assistance
to
aliens
may
have
some
effect
on
the
decision
of
an
alien
to
settle
in
pennsylvania
or
it
may
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
of
course
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
pennsylvania’s
6%
sales
tax
or
its
liquor
tax
which
is
the
second
highest
in
the
nation,
or
its
cigarettes
tax
which
is
also
somewhere
near
the
highest.
no
one
we
submit,
however,
your
honors
would
seriously
contend
that
these
statutes
are
invalid
as
an
attempt
to
regulate
aliens
because
they
might
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
your
honor
except
that
as
i
understand
the
appellee’s
argument.
the
test
that
they
are
trying
to
assert
to
ask
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
are
violating
the
supremacy
clause
in
regulating
aliens
is
whether
or
not
this
statute
does
have
some
effect
on
their
decision
to
locate
elsewhere
or
not
to
locate
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and
any
of
these
thing
could
certainly
have
an
effect
on
that
decision.
we
would
also
submit
your
honors
that
because
of
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
scheme
of
intent
which
is
indicated
by
that
statute
and
their
requirement
that
aliens
entering
this
country
be
able
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
earn
a
livelihood.
we
sincerely
doubt
that
this
factor
has
given
much
if
any
consideration
at
the
time
of
entry.
that
is
the
factor
of
whether
or
not
pennsylvania
grants
assistance
to
aliens
or
not.
and
finally
your
honors
i
would
point
out
and
i
think
it
came
up
in
the
arizona
argument,
the
federal
statute
do
not
impose
any
duty
on
the
states
to
provide
assistance
to
aliens.
in
fact,
even
in
the
federal
assistance
categories,
the
statute
leaves
it
open
to
the
states
and
would
not
cause
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
to
hold
a
state
plan
invalid
where
it
does
discriminate
against
the
aliens.
we
would
further
submit
in
this
regard
that
the
statutory
intent
and
scheme
as
set
forth
in
the
federal
statute
on
immigration
and
naturalization
particularly
in
8
u.s.c.
1182
(a)
--
1182-87,
1182-8,
1182-15,
1183
and
1251
would
lead
one
to
presume
that
the
congressional
intent
was
to
relieve
both
the
states
and
the
federal
government
of
the
burden
of
aliens
who
were
or
who
might
become
public
charges.
we
submit
therefore
that
it’s
difficult
to
see
how
the
state’s
decision
to
grant
an
affirmant
of
benefit
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
residing
in
pennsylvania
conflicts
with
this
scheme
of
federal
regulation
of
aliens.
we
had
an
allegation
which
i
think
your
honors
that
i
have
to
systematically
respond
to
in
the
brief
and
that
was
that
this
statute
according
to
the
appellee’s
position
was
enacted
as
result
of
war
hysteria.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lower
court
transcript
which
the
court
has
before
it.
there
is
only
one
minute
quantity
of
proof
and
which
was
submitted
as
a
one
man’s
opinion
in
writing
on
the
scheme
of
assistance
in
pennsylvania
which
said
that
this
was
enacted
as
a
result
of
war
hysteria.
there
is
absolutely
no
legislative
history
to
support
that
assertion.
there
is
absolutely
no
other
credible
evidence
to
support
the
charge,
except
the
opinion
of
the
one
author.
we
submit
your
honors
that
it
is
just
as
logical
and
more
in
keeping
with
the
presumption
that
the
legislature
has
a
proper
motive
in
enacting
legislation
to
assume
that
after
the
enactment
of
the
federal
social
security
law
in
1935
and
after
four
years
of
trial
and
error
basis,
the
states
could
see
a
vast
area
of
persons
who
were
not
encompassed
within
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
and
they
enacted
a
general
assistance
statute
to
take
care
of
these
particular
persons.
we
would
not
say
that
they
did
not
at
that
time
have
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
much
in
mind
when
they
did
not
provide
for
aliens
under
that
same
scheme.
in
summary
therefore
your
honors,
we
would
submit
and
we
will
admit
that
these
laws
which
create
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens
which
have
evolved
in
the
formulation
of
the
special
public
interest
rule
are
based
upon
the
assumption
that
aliens
hold
allegiance
to
foreign
nations.
we
respectfully
submit,
however,
that
if
the
court
is
ready
to
say
that
this
distinction
violates
the
precepts
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
would
also
submit
that
this
court
may
in
the
very
near
future
be
ready
to
say
that
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
and
the
denial
of
the
right
to
hold
public
office
are
also
rights
which
may
not
be
denied
to
aliens
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
did
they
say
what
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
in
the
takahashi
case,
the
court
specifically
noted
that
there
was
such
a
doctrine,
as
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
they
denied
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no
your
honor
for
the
reason
that
i
expressed
before
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
pardon?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right
your
honor.
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
i
think
the
court
has
specifically
said
and
has
spelled
out
quite
completely
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
a
state
may
attempt
to
deny
a
person’s
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
yes.
i
still
submit
there's
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
to
the
extent
your
honor
that
the
crane
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
was
the
first
real
annunciation
of
the
so-called
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
heim
versus
mccall,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor,
they
did.
i
agree
completely
your
honor
that
this
court
has
certainly
by
its
later
decisions
said
that
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
may
not
be
denied.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
agree
your
honors,
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
you
mean
different
from
others,
from
citizens
your
honor?
no,
i
don’t
think
you
could
because
that
again
would
be
an
attempting
to
regulate
his
right
to
earn
a
living.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
believe
you’re
right
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
again,
i
think
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine,
if
it
has
vitality
today
which
i
submit
that
it
still
does,
it
has
been
at
least
watered
down
to
use
the
term
by
this
court
to
the
extent
that
if
it
involves
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
this
court
has
said
that
as
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rights
granted
to
enter
and
abide.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
would
presumably
be
so
your
honor
for
the
same
reasons,
i
may
submit
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
hold
public
office.
those
taxes
which
the
alien
pays
goes
to
all
public
elections.
they
go
to
print
the
ballots
upon
which
the
elections
are
held.
they
go
to
pay
the
office
holders
who
are
elected
to
those
offices.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
beg
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
not
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
is,
however,
the
logical
extension
of
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
presume
you
could
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
nothing
further
but
if
the
court
have
some
specific
questions.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
find
nothing
in
the
amendment
itself
your
honor
which
drives
that
distinction.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
that
there
is
some
difference,
however
your
honor
if
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
correctly
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
with
my
understanding
that
this
court
had
already
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
did
apply
to
aliens
as
well
as
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
the
only
distinction
that
i
see
your
honor
and
as
i
stated
in
the
beginning,
my
whole
position
in
being
here
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
the
overall
applicability
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
one
of
them
being
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
the
state
has
the
right
in
the
conservation
of
its
assets
for
its
own
citizens
to
draw
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
fully
appreciate
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
in
all
humility
say
to
his
honor
that
if
i
were
deciding
the
case
at
this
time
perhaps,
i
would
decide
it
differently.
but
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
they
have
said
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
that
specific
thing.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
but
only
as
to
aliens
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
not
drawn
a
distinction,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
moved
for
a
leave
to
permit
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein,
a
member
of
the
pennsylvania
bar
to
argue
pro
hac
vice
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
thank
your
honor.
your
honors,
this
case
comes
before
you
on
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court
convened
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
decision
of
which
court
was
rendered
on
july
13,
1970
and
which
decision
held
section
432
(2)
of
the
pennsylvania
welfare
code
unconstitutional.
and
that
in
denying
general
assistance
to
aliens
who
are
residents
of
the
commonwealth,
it
violated
the
precepts
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fact
to
the
case
your
honor
is
relevantly
simple.
the
appellee,
elsie
mary
jane
leger
immigrated
to
this
country
from
scotland
on
may
18,
1965,
and
undertook
employment
for
which
she
remained
a
period
of
four
years.
she
applied
for
general
assistance
together
with
her
common-law
husband
shortly
prior
to
december
9,
1969
and
she
was
denied
assistance
at
that
time
solely
on
the
ground
that
she
was
an
alien.
she
commenced
her
action
in
the
federal
district
court
on
december
9,
1969.
the
court
subsequently
permitted
amendment
of
the
action
to
add
mrs.
jervis
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
to
permit
the
action
to
continue
as
a
class
action.
mrs.
beryl
jervis
who
is
the
other
party
plaintiff
to
this
action
immigrated
to
united
states
from
panama
on
march
1,
1968.
and
after
working
for
two
years,
ceased
her
employment
because
of
illness
and
applied
for
assistance.
she
too
was
denied
assistance
solely
on
the
basis
of
our
statute
which
prohibits
the
dispensing
of
assistance
to
aliens.
i
perhaps
said
that
wrong,
it
doesn’t
prohibit,
it
doesn't
provide
for
it.
presently,
there
are
two
assistance
programs
in
pennsylvania.
one
of
course
is
the
categorical
assistance
which
provides
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
aged,
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
and
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
these
are
all
federally
supported
categories
of
assistance
from
which
receive
slightly
over
one
half
of
the
funds
from
the
federal
government.
neither
of
the
named
parties
here
would
have
qualified
for
any
of
the
federal
assistance
categories.
the
other
assistance
program
which
we
have
in
pennsylvania
is
our
so-called
general
assistance
program
which
is
wholly
state
financed
and
which
provides
aid
for
all
other
persons
who
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
whom
no
aid
is
provided
under
the
categorical
assistance
programs.
i’m
going
to
be
completely
frank
with
this
court
as
i
was
with
the
lower
court
and
state
that
there
is
no
question
for
what
the
statute
draws
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens,
and
if,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
has
been
overruled,
sub
silentio
as
the
lower
court
found
that
it
was,
then
i
am
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
task
indeed
in
justifying
the
distinction.
however,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
for
a
few
short
moments,
i
should
like
to
discuss
just
briefly
the
two
cases
by
which
the
lower
court
found
that
this
court
had
overruled
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
the
first
of
these
of
course
is
a
truax
case
which
involved
the
employment
or
the
failure
to
employ
a
person
as
a
cook
in
the
state
of
arizona
because
of
the
fact
that
the
arizona
statute
provided
that
employment
had
to
be
80%
citizen,
just
as
used
in
that
case
however
specifically
noted
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
an
exception
to
the
ordinary
test
of
discrimination.
he
stated,
“this
discrimination
defined
by
the
act
does
not
pertain
to
the
regulation
or
distribution
of
the
public
domain
or
of
common
property
resources
or
the
people
of
the
state.
the
enjoinment
of
which
may
be
limited
to
citizens
as
it
begins
to
both,
as
against
both
aliens
and
citizens
of
other
states.”
we
of
course
admit
immediately
your
honors
that
we
realize
that
this
doctrine
has
been
somewhat
changed
by
your
decision
in
the
shapiro
case,
with
respect
at
least
to
citizens
of
other
states.
we
do
submit
however
that
it
retains
full
vitality
insofar
as
its
application
to
aliens
is
concerned.
32
years
later,
in
the
takahashi
case,
this
court
also
said
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
still
in
existence.
although
this
court
specifically
denied
the
claim
that
the
preservation
of
fish
within
its
three-mile
border
was
a
special
public
interest
to
the
state
of
california.
one
thing,
i
think
however
your
honors
is
very
imported
to
note
in
the
takahashi
case
and
that
is
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly,
the
statute
there
also
discriminated
among
aliens
and
that
those
who
would
have
been
denied
the
right
to
apply
for
the
fishing
permit
would
have
been
those
who
weren’t
ineligible
for
citizenship
in
the
united
states
and
therefore,
it
would
have
applied
only
to
orientals.
while
the
court
did
not
make
a
great
deal
of
this
fact,
i
do
think
it
is
a
very
important
distinction
between
that
case
and
the
case
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
finally
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
your
honor
that
we
have
agreed
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
aliens
with
of
course
the
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions.
but
if
it
does
apply
in
equal
protection,
it
would
therefore
follow
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens
because
its
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions
are
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
in
our
particular
case
here,
it
applies
regardless
of
origin.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
it
certainly
should
your
honor
because
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
at
all,
it
would
certainly
apply
to
say
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
really
think
that
it
would
go
beyond
that
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
a
compelling
state
would
justify
particular
--
i
mean
under
the
language
of
this
court
dandridge
versus
williams,
i
rather
doubt
that
there
could
be
a
compelling
state
interest
which
would
justify
discrimination
among
aliens,
between
one
class
of
aliens
and
another
class.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
finally,
this
court
has
intimated,
i
submit
in
those
cases
such
as
takahashi
and
truax
that
the
cases
involved
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
courts
have
gone
one
step
further
and
said
that
this
--
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
as
granted
to
aliens
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
would
meaningless
if
they
didn’t
have
the
right
to
employment.
and
i
for
one
your
honors
i’m
just
old
fashioned
enough
to
believe
that
there
is
still
a
distinction
in
our
law
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
accept
your
honor’s
statement
completely
and
i
think
if
i
may
at
this
time
just
by
departing
a
little
bit
refer
to
a
question
which
this
honor
asked
in
the
previous
case,
i
think
in
that
respect
your
honor
we
get
to
a
question
of
responsibility.
and
whose
responsibility
it
is.
and
of
course,
i’m
getting
a
little
ahead
in
my
argument,
but
if
the
federal
government
has
the
complete
right
to
regulate
aliens
then
of
course,
i
must
answer
your
honor
that
the
responsibility
for
these
persons,
if
it
lies
anywhere,
lies
with
the
federal
government
and
not
with
the
states.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
record
does
disclose
that
both
of
them
paid
at
least
sales
taxes
and
income
taxes
within
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
four
years,
yes
your
honor,
the
second
one
for
two.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
interest
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
complete
frank
answer
is
the
conversation
of
assets
for
its
citizen.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
saving
may
i
say,
due
the
fact
perhaps
that
we
can
serve
assets
for
our
citizens,
we
were
recently
able
to
go
to
a
100%
of
the
federal
level.
had
we
granted
to
aliens,
i’m
not
saying
we
couldn’t
have,
there’s
a
possibility
perhaps
we
couldn’t
have
gone
to
that
100%.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
just
to
the
--
completely
state
financed
general
assistance
program.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
absolutely
nothing
your
honor.
we
do
by
the
way
for
the
court’s
information,
we
do
in
our
federal
category,
we
do
grant
assistance
to
aliens
under
all
the
federal
categories.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
quite
honestly
your
honor,
it
was
a
mistake.
the
department
of
welfare
felt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no,
the
mistake
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
when
the
federal
statute
first
come
out,
our
department
felt
that
they
were
required
by
that
statute
to
grant
assist
under
the
federal
categories.
that
appears
in
the
transcript
to
the
hearing
in
the
lower
courts
your
honor.
preview
the
second
phase
of
the
appellee’s
argument
which
of
course
was
a
contention
which
was
not
important
in
the
lower
court’s
decision
but
it
was
alluded
to
there
and
of
course
is
raised
again
before
this
court
on
appeal
and
that
is
the
alien’s
right
to
travel
for
which
position
the
appellees
placed
great
reliance
on
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro
versus
thompson.
my
understanding
of
that
decision
your
honors
is
the
fact
that
this
court
found
that
the
right
of
citizens
to
travel
derives
from
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
union
itself.
the
court
did
not,
however,
according
to
my
understanding
of
that
case,
say
that
the
right
was
derived
solely
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
of
course
has
been
conceded
applies
equally
to
aliens
except
for
the
judicially
created
exception
which
we
are
advancing
to
this
court
at
this
time
which
is
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
we
would
further
point
out
your
honors
that
the
right
to
enter
and
abide,
we
feel
by
virtue
of
decisions
of
this
court
are
not
on
the
same
footing
as
the
citizen’s
right
to
travel.
the
truax
case
for
example,
this
court
noted
that
the
alien’s
right
to
enter
and
abide
stemmed
from
federal
law
and
not
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
such
right
might
therefore
be
retracted
by
federal
statute.
it
would
seem
to
follow
therefore
that
an
infringement
on
his
right
which
we
would
deny
as
brought
about
by
the
statue
here
in
question
might
be
invalid
under
the
federal
statute.
it
might
be
invalid
by
the
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause.
but
it
certainly
would
not
be
invalid
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
equal
protection
clause.
we
come
therefore
to
the
final
issue
raised
by
the
brief
and
that
is
whether
this
statute
in
pennsylvania
is
an
obstruction
of
federal
law
dealing
with
immigration
and
naturalization
or
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
regulate
aliens.
we
concede
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hines
versus
davidowitz,
the
state
can
only
do
this
within
very
narrow
limits.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
regulate
--
any
regulation
your
honor
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hines
case
must
be
construed
very,
very
strictly
and
within
very
narrow
limits.
however,
as
judge
wood
appropriately
noted
in
his
dissent
in
the
lower
court,
if
pennsylvania
had
no
general
assistance
program
at
all,
federal
laws
dealing
with
aliens
would
not
be
obstructed.
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
see
how
federal
laws
are
anymore
obstructed
because
the
state
decides
to
give
welfare
payments
to
its
citizens.
furthermore,
insofar
as
attempting
to
regulate
aliens
is
concerned,
how
can
a
statute
which
grants
assistance
to
citizens
be
said
to
regulate
aliens
anymore
than
a
statute
which
would
grant
assistance
to
person
over
65
can
be
said
to
be
regulating
persons
under
65
and
to
take
it
one
step
further,
let
us
assume
that
the
statute
grants
assistance
to
all
persons
over
65,
alien
or
citizen.
can
an
alien
then
come
in
and
challenge
the
statute
as
being
discriminatory
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
because
it
attempts
to
regulate
him.
we
respectfully
submit
to
state
that
proposition
indicates
its
absurdity.
appellee,
in
their
brief
assert
that
the
state's
denial
of
general
assistance
to
aliens
may
have
some
effect
on
the
decision
of
an
alien
to
settle
in
pennsylvania
or
it
may
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
of
course
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
pennsylvania’s
6%
sales
tax
or
its
liquor
tax
which
is
the
second
highest
in
the
nation,
or
its
cigarettes
tax
which
is
also
somewhere
near
the
highest.
no
one
we
submit,
however,
your
honors
would
seriously
contend
that
these
statutes
are
invalid
as
an
attempt
to
regulate
aliens
because
they
might
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
your
honor
except
that
as
i
understand
the
appellee’s
argument.
the
test
that
they
are
trying
to
assert
to
ask
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
are
violating
the
supremacy
clause
in
regulating
aliens
is
whether
or
not
this
statute
does
have
some
effect
on
their
decision
to
locate
elsewhere
or
not
to
locate
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and
any
of
these
thing
could
certainly
have
an
effect
on
that
decision.
we
would
also
submit
your
honors
that
because
of
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
scheme
of
intent
which
is
indicated
by
that
statute
and
their
requirement
that
aliens
entering
this
country
be
able
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
earn
a
livelihood.
we
sincerely
doubt
that
this
factor
has
given
much
if
any
consideration
at
the
time
of
entry.
that
is
the
factor
of
whether
or
not
pennsylvania
grants
assistance
to
aliens
or
not.
and
finally
your
honors
i
would
point
out
and
i
think
it
came
up
in
the
arizona
argument,
the
federal
statute
do
not
impose
any
duty
on
the
states
to
provide
assistance
to
aliens.
in
fact,
even
in
the
federal
assistance
categories,
the
statute
leaves
it
open
to
the
states
and
would
not
cause
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
to
hold
a
state
plan
invalid
where
it
does
discriminate
against
the
aliens.
we
would
further
submit
in
this
regard
that
the
statutory
intent
and
scheme
as
set
forth
in
the
federal
statute
on
immigration
and
naturalization
particularly
in
8
u.s.c.
1182
(a)
--
1182-87,
1182-8,
1182-15,
1183
and
1251
would
lead
one
to
presume
that
the
congressional
intent
was
to
relieve
both
the
states
and
the
federal
government
of
the
burden
of
aliens
who
were
or
who
might
become
public
charges.
we
submit
therefore
that
it’s
difficult
to
see
how
the
state’s
decision
to
grant
an
affirmant
of
benefit
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
residing
in
pennsylvania
conflicts
with
this
scheme
of
federal
regulation
of
aliens.
we
had
an
allegation
which
i
think
your
honors
that
i
have
to
systematically
respond
to
in
the
brief
and
that
was
that
this
statute
according
to
the
appellee’s
position
was
enacted
as
result
of
war
hysteria.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lower
court
transcript
which
the
court
has
before
it.
there
is
only
one
minute
quantity
of
proof
and
which
was
submitted
as
a
one
man’s
opinion
in
writing
on
the
scheme
of
assistance
in
pennsylvania
which
said
that
this
was
enacted
as
a
result
of
war
hysteria.
there
is
absolutely
no
legislative
history
to
support
that
assertion.
there
is
absolutely
no
other
credible
evidence
to
support
the
charge,
except
the
opinion
of
the
one
author.
we
submit
your
honors
that
it
is
just
as
logical
and
more
in
keeping
with
the
presumption
that
the
legislature
has
a
proper
motive
in
enacting
legislation
to
assume
that
after
the
enactment
of
the
federal
social
security
law
in
1935
and
after
four
years
of
trial
and
error
basis,
the
states
could
see
a
vast
area
of
persons
who
were
not
encompassed
within
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
and
they
enacted
a
general
assistance
statute
to
take
care
of
these
particular
persons.
we
would
not
say
that
they
did
not
at
that
time
have
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
much
in
mind
when
they
did
not
provide
for
aliens
under
that
same
scheme.
in
summary
therefore
your
honors,
we
would
submit
and
we
will
admit
that
these
laws
which
create
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens
which
have
evolved
in
the
formulation
of
the
special
public
interest
rule
are
based
upon
the
assumption
that
aliens
hold
allegiance
to
foreign
nations.
we
respectfully
submit,
however,
that
if
the
court
is
ready
to
say
that
this
distinction
violates
the
precepts
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
would
also
submit
that
this
court
may
in
the
very
near
future
be
ready
to
say
that
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
and
the
denial
of
the
right
to
hold
public
office
are
also
rights
which
may
not
be
denied
to
aliens
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
did
they
say
what
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
in
the
takahashi
case,
the
court
specifically
noted
that
there
was
such
a
doctrine,
as
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
they
denied
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no
your
honor
for
the
reason
that
i
expressed
before
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
pardon?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right
your
honor.
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
i
think
the
court
has
specifically
said
and
has
spelled
out
quite
completely
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
a
state
may
attempt
to
deny
a
person’s
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
yes.
i
still
submit
there's
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
to
the
extent
your
honor
that
the
crane
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
was
the
first
real
annunciation
of
the
so-called
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
heim
versus
mccall,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor,
they
did.
i
agree
completely
your
honor
that
this
court
has
certainly
by
its
later
decisions
said
that
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
may
not
be
denied.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
agree
your
honors,
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
you
mean
different
from
others,
from
citizens
your
honor?
no,
i
don’t
think
you
could
because
that
again
would
be
an
attempting
to
regulate
his
right
to
earn
a
living.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
believe
you’re
right
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
again,
i
think
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine,
if
it
has
vitality
today
which
i
submit
that
it
still
does,
it
has
been
at
least
watered
down
to
use
the
term
by
this
court
to
the
extent
that
if
it
involves
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
this
court
has
said
that
as
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rights
granted
to
enter
and
abide.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
would
presumably
be
so
your
honor
for
the
same
reasons,
i
may
submit
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
hold
public
office.
those
taxes
which
the
alien
pays
goes
to
all
public
elections.
they
go
to
print
the
ballots
upon
which
the
elections
are
held.
they
go
to
pay
the
office
holders
who
are
elected
to
those
offices.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
beg
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
not
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
is,
however,
the
logical
extension
of
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
presume
you
could
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
nothing
further
but
if
the
court
have
some
specific
questions.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
find
nothing
in
the
amendment
itself
your
honor
which
drives
that
distinction.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
that
there
is
some
difference,
however
your
honor
if
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
correctly
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
with
my
understanding
that
this
court
had
already
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
did
apply
to
aliens
as
well
as
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
the
only
distinction
that
i
see
your
honor
and
as
i
stated
in
the
beginning,
my
whole
position
in
being
here
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
the
overall
applicability
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
one
of
them
being
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
the
state
has
the
right
in
the
conservation
of
its
assets
for
its
own
citizens
to
draw
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
fully
appreciate
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
in
all
humility
say
to
his
honor
that
if
i
were
deciding
the
case
at
this
time
perhaps,
i
would
decide
it
differently.
but
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
they
have
said
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
that
specific
thing.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
but
only
as
to
aliens
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
not
drawn
a
distinction,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
moved
for
a
leave
to
permit
mr.
jonathan
m.
stein,
a
member
of
the
pennsylvania
bar
to
argue
pro
hac
vice
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
thank
your
honor.
your
honors,
this
case
comes
before
you
on
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court
convened
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
decision
of
which
court
was
rendered
on
july
13,
1970
and
which
decision
held
section
432
(2)
of
the
pennsylvania
welfare
code
unconstitutional.
and
that
in
denying
general
assistance
to
aliens
who
are
residents
of
the
commonwealth,
it
violated
the
precepts
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fact
to
the
case
your
honor
is
relevantly
simple.
the
appellee,
elsie
mary
jane
leger
immigrated
to
this
country
from
scotland
on
may
18,
1965,
and
undertook
employment
for
which
she
remained
a
period
of
four
years.
she
applied
for
general
assistance
together
with
her
common-law
husband
shortly
prior
to
december
9,
1969
and
she
was
denied
assistance
at
that
time
solely
on
the
ground
that
she
was
an
alien.
she
commenced
her
action
in
the
federal
district
court
on
december
9,
1969.
the
court
subsequently
permitted
amendment
of
the
action
to
add
mrs.
jervis
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
to
permit
the
action
to
continue
as
a
class
action.
mrs.
beryl
jervis
who
is
the
other
party
plaintiff
to
this
action
immigrated
to
united
states
from
panama
on
march
1,
1968.
and
after
working
for
two
years,
ceased
her
employment
because
of
illness
and
applied
for
assistance.
she
too
was
denied
assistance
solely
on
the
basis
of
our
statute
which
prohibits
the
dispensing
of
assistance
to
aliens.
i
perhaps
said
that
wrong,
it
doesn’t
prohibit,
it
doesn't
provide
for
it.
presently,
there
are
two
assistance
programs
in
pennsylvania.
one
of
course
is
the
categorical
assistance
which
provides
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
aged,
aid
to
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
and
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
these
are
all
federally
supported
categories
of
assistance
from
which
receive
slightly
over
one
half
of
the
funds
from
the
federal
government.
neither
of
the
named
parties
here
would
have
qualified
for
any
of
the
federal
assistance
categories.
the
other
assistance
program
which
we
have
in
pennsylvania
is
our
so-called
general
assistance
program
which
is
wholly
state
financed
and
which
provides
aid
for
all
other
persons
who
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
for
whom
no
aid
is
provided
under
the
categorical
assistance
programs.
i’m
going
to
be
completely
frank
with
this
court
as
i
was
with
the
lower
court
and
state
that
there
is
no
question
for
what
the
statute
draws
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens,
and
if,
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
has
been
overruled,
sub
silentio
as
the
lower
court
found
that
it
was,
then
i
am
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
task
indeed
in
justifying
the
distinction.
however,
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
for
a
few
short
moments,
i
should
like
to
discuss
just
briefly
the
two
cases
by
which
the
lower
court
found
that
this
court
had
overruled
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
the
first
of
these
of
course
is
a
truax
case
which
involved
the
employment
or
the
failure
to
employ
a
person
as
a
cook
in
the
state
of
arizona
because
of
the
fact
that
the
arizona
statute
provided
that
employment
had
to
be
80%
citizen,
just
as
used
in
that
case
however
specifically
noted
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
an
exception
to
the
ordinary
test
of
discrimination.
he
stated,
“this
discrimination
defined
by
the
act
does
not
pertain
to
the
regulation
or
distribution
of
the
public
domain
or
of
common
property
resources
or
the
people
of
the
state.
the
enjoinment
of
which
may
be
limited
to
citizens
as
it
begins
to
both,
as
against
both
aliens
and
citizens
of
other
states.”
we
of
course
admit
immediately
your
honors
that
we
realize
that
this
doctrine
has
been
somewhat
changed
by
your
decision
in
the
shapiro
case,
with
respect
at
least
to
citizens
of
other
states.
we
do
submit
however
that
it
retains
full
vitality
insofar
as
its
application
to
aliens
is
concerned.
32
years
later,
in
the
takahashi
case,
this
court
also
said
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
was
still
in
existence.
although
this
court
specifically
denied
the
claim
that
the
preservation
of
fish
within
its
three-mile
border
was
a
special
public
interest
to
the
state
of
california.
one
thing,
i
think
however
your
honors
is
very
imported
to
note
in
the
takahashi
case
and
that
is
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly,
the
statute
there
also
discriminated
among
aliens
and
that
those
who
would
have
been
denied
the
right
to
apply
for
the
fishing
permit
would
have
been
those
who
weren’t
ineligible
for
citizenship
in
the
united
states
and
therefore,
it
would
have
applied
only
to
orientals.
while
the
court
did
not
make
a
great
deal
of
this
fact,
i
do
think
it
is
a
very
important
distinction
between
that
case
and
the
case
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
finally
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
your
honor
that
we
have
agreed
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
aliens
with
of
course
the
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions.
but
if
it
does
apply
in
equal
protection,
it
would
therefore
follow
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens
because
its
so-called
judicially
created
exceptions
are
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
in
our
particular
case
here,
it
applies
regardless
of
origin.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
it
certainly
should
your
honor
because
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
at
all,
it
would
certainly
apply
to
say
that
you
cannot
discriminate
among
aliens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
really
think
that
it
would
go
beyond
that
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
a
compelling
state
would
justify
particular
--
i
mean
under
the
language
of
this
court
dandridge
versus
williams,
i
rather
doubt
that
there
could
be
a
compelling
state
interest
which
would
justify
discrimination
among
aliens,
between
one
class
of
aliens
and
another
class.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
finally,
this
court
has
intimated,
i
submit
in
those
cases
such
as
takahashi
and
truax
that
the
cases
involved
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
courts
have
gone
one
step
further
and
said
that
this
--
the
right
to
enter
and
abide
as
granted
to
aliens
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
would
meaningless
if
they
didn’t
have
the
right
to
employment.
and
i
for
one
your
honors
i’m
just
old
fashioned
enough
to
believe
that
there
is
still
a
distinction
in
our
law
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
accept
your
honor’s
statement
completely
and
i
think
if
i
may
at
this
time
just
by
departing
a
little
bit
refer
to
a
question
which
this
honor
asked
in
the
previous
case,
i
think
in
that
respect
your
honor
we
get
to
a
question
of
responsibility.
and
whose
responsibility
it
is.
and
of
course,
i’m
getting
a
little
ahead
in
my
argument,
but
if
the
federal
government
has
the
complete
right
to
regulate
aliens
then
of
course,
i
must
answer
your
honor
that
the
responsibility
for
these
persons,
if
it
lies
anywhere,
lies
with
the
federal
government
and
not
with
the
states.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
record
does
disclose
that
both
of
them
paid
at
least
sales
taxes
and
income
taxes
within
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
four
years,
yes
your
honor,
the
second
one
for
two.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
interest
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
complete
frank
answer
is
the
conversation
of
assets
for
its
citizen.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
saving
may
i
say,
due
the
fact
perhaps
that
we
can
serve
assets
for
our
citizens,
we
were
recently
able
to
go
to
a
100%
of
the
federal
level.
had
we
granted
to
aliens,
i’m
not
saying
we
couldn’t
have,
there’s
a
possibility
perhaps
we
couldn’t
have
gone
to
that
100%.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
money,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor.
just
to
the
--
completely
state
financed
general
assistance
program.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
absolutely
nothing
your
honor.
we
do
by
the
way
for
the
court’s
information,
we
do
in
our
federal
category,
we
do
grant
assistance
to
aliens
under
all
the
federal
categories.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
quite
honestly
your
honor,
it
was
a
mistake.
the
department
of
welfare
felt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no,
the
mistake
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
when
the
federal
statute
first
come
out,
our
department
felt
that
they
were
required
by
that
statute
to
grant
assist
under
the
federal
categories.
that
appears
in
the
transcript
to
the
hearing
in
the
lower
courts
your
honor.
preview
the
second
phase
of
the
appellee’s
argument
which
of
course
was
a
contention
which
was
not
important
in
the
lower
court’s
decision
but
it
was
alluded
to
there
and
of
course
is
raised
again
before
this
court
on
appeal
and
that
is
the
alien’s
right
to
travel
for
which
position
the
appellees
placed
great
reliance
on
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro
versus
thompson.
my
understanding
of
that
decision
your
honors
is
the
fact
that
this
court
found
that
the
right
of
citizens
to
travel
derives
from
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
union
itself.
the
court
did
not,
however,
according
to
my
understanding
of
that
case,
say
that
the
right
was
derived
solely
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
of
course
has
been
conceded
applies
equally
to
aliens
except
for
the
judicially
created
exception
which
we
are
advancing
to
this
court
at
this
time
which
is
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
we
would
further
point
out
your
honors
that
the
right
to
enter
and
abide,
we
feel
by
virtue
of
decisions
of
this
court
are
not
on
the
same
footing
as
the
citizen’s
right
to
travel.
the
truax
case
for
example,
this
court
noted
that
the
alien’s
right
to
enter
and
abide
stemmed
from
federal
law
and
not
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
such
right
might
therefore
be
retracted
by
federal
statute.
it
would
seem
to
follow
therefore
that
an
infringement
on
his
right
which
we
would
deny
as
brought
about
by
the
statue
here
in
question
might
be
invalid
under
the
federal
statute.
it
might
be
invalid
by
the
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause.
but
it
certainly
would
not
be
invalid
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment’s
equal
protection
clause.
we
come
therefore
to
the
final
issue
raised
by
the
brief
and
that
is
whether
this
statute
in
pennsylvania
is
an
obstruction
of
federal
law
dealing
with
immigration
and
naturalization
or
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
regulate
aliens.
we
concede
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hines
versus
davidowitz,
the
state
can
only
do
this
within
very
narrow
limits.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
regulate
--
any
regulation
your
honor
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hines
case
must
be
construed
very,
very
strictly
and
within
very
narrow
limits.
however,
as
judge
wood
appropriately
noted
in
his
dissent
in
the
lower
court,
if
pennsylvania
had
no
general
assistance
program
at
all,
federal
laws
dealing
with
aliens
would
not
be
obstructed.
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
see
how
federal
laws
are
anymore
obstructed
because
the
state
decides
to
give
welfare
payments
to
its
citizens.
furthermore,
insofar
as
attempting
to
regulate
aliens
is
concerned,
how
can
a
statute
which
grants
assistance
to
citizens
be
said
to
regulate
aliens
anymore
than
a
statute
which
would
grant
assistance
to
person
over
65
can
be
said
to
be
regulating
persons
under
65
and
to
take
it
one
step
further,
let
us
assume
that
the
statute
grants
assistance
to
all
persons
over
65,
alien
or
citizen.
can
an
alien
then
come
in
and
challenge
the
statute
as
being
discriminatory
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
because
it
attempts
to
regulate
him.
we
respectfully
submit
to
state
that
proposition
indicates
its
absurdity.
appellee,
in
their
brief
assert
that
the
state's
denial
of
general
assistance
to
aliens
may
have
some
effect
on
the
decision
of
an
alien
to
settle
in
pennsylvania
or
it
may
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
of
course
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
pennsylvania’s
6%
sales
tax
or
its
liquor
tax
which
is
the
second
highest
in
the
nation,
or
its
cigarettes
tax
which
is
also
somewhere
near
the
highest.
no
one
we
submit,
however,
your
honors
would
seriously
contend
that
these
statutes
are
invalid
as
an
attempt
to
regulate
aliens
because
they
might
cause
him
to
remove
elsewhere.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
it
is
your
honor
except
that
as
i
understand
the
appellee’s
argument.
the
test
that
they
are
trying
to
assert
to
ask
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
are
violating
the
supremacy
clause
in
regulating
aliens
is
whether
or
not
this
statute
does
have
some
effect
on
their
decision
to
locate
elsewhere
or
not
to
locate
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and
any
of
these
thing
could
certainly
have
an
effect
on
that
decision.
we
would
also
submit
your
honors
that
because
of
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
scheme
of
intent
which
is
indicated
by
that
statute
and
their
requirement
that
aliens
entering
this
country
be
able
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
earn
a
livelihood.
we
sincerely
doubt
that
this
factor
has
given
much
if
any
consideration
at
the
time
of
entry.
that
is
the
factor
of
whether
or
not
pennsylvania
grants
assistance
to
aliens
or
not.
and
finally
your
honors
i
would
point
out
and
i
think
it
came
up
in
the
arizona
argument,
the
federal
statute
do
not
impose
any
duty
on
the
states
to
provide
assistance
to
aliens.
in
fact,
even
in
the
federal
assistance
categories,
the
statute
leaves
it
open
to
the
states
and
would
not
cause
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
to
hold
a
state
plan
invalid
where
it
does
discriminate
against
the
aliens.
we
would
further
submit
in
this
regard
that
the
statutory
intent
and
scheme
as
set
forth
in
the
federal
statute
on
immigration
and
naturalization
particularly
in
8
u.s.c.
1182
(a)
--
1182-87,
1182-8,
1182-15,
1183
and
1251
would
lead
one
to
presume
that
the
congressional
intent
was
to
relieve
both
the
states
and
the
federal
government
of
the
burden
of
aliens
who
were
or
who
might
become
public
charges.
we
submit
therefore
that
it’s
difficult
to
see
how
the
state’s
decision
to
grant
an
affirmant
of
benefit
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
residing
in
pennsylvania
conflicts
with
this
scheme
of
federal
regulation
of
aliens.
we
had
an
allegation
which
i
think
your
honors
that
i
have
to
systematically
respond
to
in
the
brief
and
that
was
that
this
statute
according
to
the
appellee’s
position
was
enacted
as
result
of
war
hysteria.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
lower
court
transcript
which
the
court
has
before
it.
there
is
only
one
minute
quantity
of
proof
and
which
was
submitted
as
a
one
man’s
opinion
in
writing
on
the
scheme
of
assistance
in
pennsylvania
which
said
that
this
was
enacted
as
a
result
of
war
hysteria.
there
is
absolutely
no
legislative
history
to
support
that
assertion.
there
is
absolutely
no
other
credible
evidence
to
support
the
charge,
except
the
opinion
of
the
one
author.
we
submit
your
honors
that
it
is
just
as
logical
and
more
in
keeping
with
the
presumption
that
the
legislature
has
a
proper
motive
in
enacting
legislation
to
assume
that
after
the
enactment
of
the
federal
social
security
law
in
1935
and
after
four
years
of
trial
and
error
basis,
the
states
could
see
a
vast
area
of
persons
who
were
not
encompassed
within
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
and
they
enacted
a
general
assistance
statute
to
take
care
of
these
particular
persons.
we
would
not
say
that
they
did
not
at
that
time
have
the
special
public
interest
doctrine
much
in
mind
when
they
did
not
provide
for
aliens
under
that
same
scheme.
in
summary
therefore
your
honors,
we
would
submit
and
we
will
admit
that
these
laws
which
create
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens
which
have
evolved
in
the
formulation
of
the
special
public
interest
rule
are
based
upon
the
assumption
that
aliens
hold
allegiance
to
foreign
nations.
we
respectfully
submit,
however,
that
if
the
court
is
ready
to
say
that
this
distinction
violates
the
precepts
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
would
also
submit
that
this
court
may
in
the
very
near
future
be
ready
to
say
that
denial
for
the
right
to
vote
and
the
denial
of
the
right
to
hold
public
office
are
also
rights
which
may
not
be
denied
to
aliens
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
did
they
say
what
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
in
the
takahashi
case,
the
court
specifically
noted
that
there
was
such
a
doctrine,
as
a
special
public
interest
doctrine.
they
denied
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
no
your
honor
for
the
reason
that
i
expressed
before
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
pardon?
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right
your
honor.
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
i
think
the
court
has
specifically
said
and
has
spelled
out
quite
completely
--
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
a
state
may
attempt
to
deny
a
person’s
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
yes.
i
still
submit
there's
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
the
right
to
receive
a
public
largess.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
only
to
the
extent
your
honor
that
the
crane
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
was
the
first
real
annunciation
of
the
so-called
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
heim
versus
mccall,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
your
honor,
they
did.
i
agree
completely
your
honor
that
this
court
has
certainly
by
its
later
decisions
said
that
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
may
not
be
denied.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
agree
your
honors,
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
you
mean
different
from
others,
from
citizens
your
honor?
no,
i
don’t
think
you
could
because
that
again
would
be
an
attempting
to
regulate
his
right
to
earn
a
living.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
believe
you’re
right
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
again,
i
think
that
the
special
public
interest
doctrine,
if
it
has
vitality
today
which
i
submit
that
it
still
does,
it
has
been
at
least
watered
down
to
use
the
term
by
this
court
to
the
extent
that
if
it
involves
the
right
to
earn
a
livelihood,
this
court
has
said
that
as
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rights
granted
to
enter
and
abide.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
would
presumably
be
so
your
honor
for
the
same
reasons,
i
may
submit
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
that
he
is
denied
the
right
to
hold
public
office.
those
taxes
which
the
alien
pays
goes
to
all
public
elections.
they
go
to
print
the
ballots
upon
which
the
elections
are
held.
they
go
to
pay
the
office
holders
who
are
elected
to
those
offices.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
beg
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
not
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
is,
however,
the
logical
extension
of
this
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
presume
you
could
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
mr.
chief
justice
i
have
nothing
further
but
if
the
court
have
some
specific
questions.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
find
nothing
in
the
amendment
itself
your
honor
which
drives
that
distinction.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
think
that
there
is
some
difference,
however
your
honor
if
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
correctly
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
with
my
understanding
that
this
court
had
already
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
did
apply
to
aliens
as
well
as
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
the
only
distinction
that
i
see
your
honor
and
as
i
stated
in
the
beginning,
my
whole
position
in
being
here
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
the
overall
applicability
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
one
of
them
being
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
the
special
public
interest
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
that
the
state
has
the
right
in
the
conservation
of
its
assets
for
its
own
citizens
to
draw
a
distinction
between
aliens
and
citizens.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
fully
appreciate
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
i
would
in
all
humility
say
to
his
honor
that
if
i
were
deciding
the
case
at
this
time
perhaps,
i
would
decide
it
differently.
but
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
they
have
said
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions
to
that
specific
thing.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
right.
but
only
as
to
aliens
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
work
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
not
drawn
a
distinction,
yes.
