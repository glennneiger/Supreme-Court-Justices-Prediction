unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
an
all
dispute
clause
in
the
contract
or
just
something
limited
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
statutory
penalty
got
to
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
the
employer
holds
some
overtime
and
but
he
was
late
to
paying
it,
but
then
he
finally
paid
it
and
that
was
the
only
thing
was
the
question
of
the
statutory
penalty?
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
pays
it?
unknown
speaker
then
there's
a
statutory
penalty
for
the
each
day
that
he
delayed,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
alright,
let's
say,
let's
just
assume
that's
all
that's
left
over
in
the
dispute
between
the
parties
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
employer
agrees.
he
has
paid
it
already.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
delay.
there
was
a
delay
and
the
employer
finally
pays
it.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
arbitration
should
then
consider
only
the
amount
of
the
overtime?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
was
an
all
disputes
clause
in
this
contract?
unknown
speaker
so,
when
the
lower
court,
the
judge
and
said
as
i
read
it,
they
agreed
that
in
order
to
bring
your
position
are
the
grievance
procedure
but
the
right
to
certify
to
the
seaman
had
to
have
their
source
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
that's
where
i
read
it
and
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is,
what's
the
difference
passage
for
this
man's
claim
can
be
traced
if
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
itself
or
do
the
articles
in
which
he
signed,
which
i
didn't
find
in
the
record,
how
do
you
face
it,
how
do
you
find
it?
unknown
speaker
of
what
--
the
contract
of
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
do
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
articles
have
no
relevance?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sullivan,
should
i
detect
in
this
record
a
reference
of
this
man
to
the
union's
agent
in
japan?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
fact
in
and
of
itself
indicative
of
the
desirability
of
such
statute?
unknown
speaker
how
long
is
the
statute
been
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
an
all
dispute
clause
in
the
contract
or
just
something
