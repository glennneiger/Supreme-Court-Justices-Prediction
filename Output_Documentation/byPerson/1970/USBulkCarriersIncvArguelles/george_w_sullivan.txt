mr.
george
w.
sullivan
we'll
do
our
best
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
a
steamship
operator
has
sought
to
review
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
divided
decision
which
reversed
the
u.s.
district
court
in
the
city
of
baltimore.
the
case
involves
an
essence
whether
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
was
negotiated
by
the
national
maritime
union
with
the
steamship
employer
will
be
the
basis
upon
which
the
disputes
that
have
arisen
and
are
referred
to
in
this
case
will
be
resolved.
the
initial
cause
of
action
as
stated
by
the
respondent
in
the
district
court
sought
to
recover
firstly
a
transportation
differential
between
first
class
and
second
class
transportation.
that
was
resolved
before
the
case
ever
got
to
its
final
posture
in
the
district
court.
the
next
item
in
his
claims
involved
certain
overtime
earnings
that
he
said,
he
was
entitled
to,
but
had
not
been
paid
and
these
were
disputed
by
the
master
of
the
vessel
the
time
he
signed
of
articles
in
the
port
of
saigon.
the
third
issue
involves
alleged
penalties
to
which
he
refers
as
a
source
of
entitlement
46
u.s.c.a.
section
596.
now,
to
see
this
case
more
or
less
in
the
posture,
i'd
like
to
review
briefly
the
facts.
mr.
arguelles,
american
merchant
seaman
was
engaged
in
the
court
of
galveston,
texas
on
august
3,
1965,
to
service
an
ordinary
seaman
aboard
the
ss
u.s.
pecos.
this
is
a
merchant
vessel.
it's
not
a
naval
vessel
despite
u.s.
in
the
title.
he
served
aboard
the
vessel
and
at
the
time
when
the
six
months
which
was
the
period
of
the
articles
he
signed
has
part
of
his
engagement
expired
on
february
3,
1966.
the
vessel
was
entering
an
anchor
--
anchorage
off
of
cap
st.
jacques
which
is
just
off
the
coast
of
south
vietnam.
the
vessel
was
destined
to
go
to
saigon
to
discharge
cargo
which
was
in
the
ship.
the
local
authorities
denied
pratique
--
they
didn't
deny
pratique,
they
just
didn't
run
it.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
vessel
couldn't
go
up
the
river
to
the
port
to
discharge
and
everyone
was
required
to
stay
on
the
vessel
until
pratique
was
granted.
this
is
a
form
of
clearance
to
establish
that
the
crew
is
healthy,
meets
the
quarantine
requirements
and
what
have
you.
on
february
13th,
pratique
was
granted
and
the
vessel
proceeded
up
the
river
to
saigon,
a
trip
of
some
seven
hours.
there
up
from
the
15th
cargo
discharge
was
started.
and
on
the
17th,
the
respondent,
in
the
company
of
17
other
men
asked
to
be
sign
off
articles.
they
were
referred
to
the
u.s.
consul
who
was
acting
in
that
court
in
the
capacity
of
shipping
commissioner
which
is
customarily
inform
ports
when
the
seaman
leave
the
ship.
the
men
were
given
a
payroll
voucher
which
outlined
the
earnings,
the
base
wages
and
overtime.
this
was
certified
by
the
consul
and
the
men
were
given
transportation
to
return
to
the
united
states,
a
dispute
arose
at
that
time.
the
men
wanted
to
be
paid
off
in
cash
because
of
the
situation
in
south
vietnam
and
the
currency
situation,
u.s.
currency
was
not
given
to
the
men.
they
were
allowed
$50
to
use
for
expenses
incidental
perhaps
to
travel
home.
because
of
the
dispute
that
arose,
the
men
respondent
included
mr.
kline.
they
left
the
next
day
and
based
on
the
testimony
of
the
respondent
in
his
pre-trial
deposition,
he
arrived
in
galveston
on
or
about
the
19th
of
february.
for
reasons
of
his
own
convenience
i
assumed,
he
didn't
report
to
the
company
agent
until
the
22nd
of
february
when
he
was
given
cash
as
certified
to
in
the
voucher.
it
is
his
claim
that
this
was
wrong,
he
shouldn't
been
paid
off
more
expeditiously
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
596.
the
failure
to
give
him
his
overtime
wages
was
likewise
a
failure
to
pay
earn
wages
even
though
they
have
been
disallowed
by
the
department
head
on
the
vessel
in
accordance
to
terms
and
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
further,
he
was
claiming
because
the
11
days
when
pratique
had
not
been
granted
at
the
anchorage
of
cap
st.
jacques,
that
he
was
unjustifiably
restricted
to
the
ship
and
it
was
entitled
additional
eight
days
or
rather
11
days
of
overtime,
eight
hours
a
day,
as
a
penalty.
it
gets
somewhat
confusing
in
analyzing
the
claim
for
penalties
due
to
it
appears
that
at
one
point
in
the
complaint
filed
the
district
court.
there
is
a
claim
of
double
a
day's
pay
as
provided
for
in
section
596
as
the
penalty.
on
top
of
the
penalty,
overtime
not
paid
the
rather
claim
for
restriction
to
ship
but
not
paid.
now,
our
position
in
essence
is
this,
that
all
of
the
claims
that
have
been
presented
here
are
based
on
the
terms
and
provision
to
collective-bargaining
agreement.
and
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
there
is
a
procedure
for
presenting
grievances,
a
procedure
for
arbitration
and
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
at
least
in
the
first
instance
based
on
the
decision
of
this
court,
he
is
required
to
pursue
those
procedures
to
get
the
remedy
available
if
he
is
entitle
rather
than
going
to
court
and
start
a
lawsuit.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
it
is
limited
to
the
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
the
statutory
penalty
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
if
the
employer
owed
the
overtime
and
was
late
in
paying
it
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
the
penalty
would
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
double
a
day's
pay
but
if
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
we
first
have
to
determine
the
overtime
is
due
now.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
then
there
would
be
no
basis
for
penalty
either
if
he
was
paid
unless
there
was
a
delay
beyond
the
theory.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
assume
you're
speaking
hypothetically
as
opposed
to
the
fact
of
this
particular
case
because
we
don't
concede
there
was
a
delay
in
this
case.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
if
i
may
read
from
section
--
article
xii
which
covers
this,
perhaps
we're
differing
on
terminology.
“in
case
a
dispute
arises
over
the
interpretation
of
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement,
whether
said
dispute
originates
on
board
ship
or
ashore,
the
union
agrees
to
take
the
matter
up
with
the
company
and
make
every
effort
to
adjust
the
said
dispute.
in
event
that
no
amicable
and
so
forth.”
this
would
pretty
much
be
resolve
to
the
disputes
arising
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
contract
itself
and
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
if
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
in
the
context
of
wages,
if
the
earned
wages
admittedly
due
to
a
man
were
not
paid.
i
don't
believe
the
contract
will
then
be
able
to
resolve
that
you
would
have
to
then
go
to
the
court
and
sue,
but
the
big
question
is
determining
under
the
contract
and
that's
what
i
think
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
whether
anything
is
due
in
the
first
instance.
if
the
money
itself
is
due
and
concededly
due
and
the
company
just
arbitrarily
refuses
the
pay
it,
i
think
the
man
then
has
of
cause
under
596
because
the
contract
doesn't
go
that
far.
but
before
you
can
even
get
to
anything
like
that
of
arbitrary
upon
payment,
one
has
to
first
determine
that
something
is
due
and
this
is
not
been
done
and
that's
where
i
believe
that
it's
very
important
that
grievance
procedure
be
pursued.
i
think
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
until
the
disputes
are
resolved
one
way
or
the
other
and
it
is
assumed
that
if
they're
resolve
in
favor
of
the
seaman,
the
wages
will
be
paid.
so,
it
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
the
penalty
in
that
instance.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
believe
the
decisions
have
held
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
overtime
wages
are
--
are
wages,
are
earnings
but
on
the
context
to
the
statutes.
so
there
wouldn't
be
any
distinction
between
the
base
wage
and
the
overtime
earnings.
once
it
is
determined,
the
overtime
earnings
are
due
if
they're
arbitrarily
would
held
beyond
the
period
provided
in
the
statute.
penalties
might
very
well
be
justified
unless
again
we
get
back
to
another
aspect
of
section
596
sufficient
cause.
if
it
can
be
shown
there
was
a
sufficient
cause
for
the
nonpayment
of
the
money
due
then
of
course
the
penalties
have
not
been
applied
in
most
instances.
this
court
in
johnson
versus
isbrandtsen
determines
the
case
that
doesn't
play
touch
the
facts
of
this
case
that
we're
dealing
here
determine
that
there
was
sufficient
cause
and
even
though
there
was
a
delay
in
the
payment
because
of
wrongful
withholding
of
certain
funds
out
of
earned
wages.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
think
that
purpose
where
money
is
due.
it
is
to
prevent
the
employer
from
being
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
paying
money
conceded
to
be
due
to
the
man.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
when
you
come
to
the
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
no,
but
there
may
be
sufficient
cause
if
that
is
resolve
then
we
come
to
another
problem
or
that
could
be
a
problem.
but
what
is
being
claimed
here.
these
overtimes
and
restrictions
to
ship
under
the
conditions
that
are
endeavored
to
describe
create
rights
that
were
created
by
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
themselves.
therefore,
if
there
is
a
dispute,
we
submit
it
should
be
resolve
on
the
basis
of
the
grievance
procedure,
any
arbitration
procedure
in
the
contract.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
agreement
that
would
provide
that
the
agreement
merely
provides
that
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
would
lead
to
the
payment.
the
union
will
refer
to
the
matters
of
the
company
for
payment.
you
see,
as
a
practical
matter
what
happens
when
these
ships
pay
off
at
the
end
of
a
voyage,
it
usually
have
a
union
patrolman
aboard
and
the
individual
crew
members
that
has
a
problem
he
says,
well
he
works
certain
overtime
that's
not
being
allowed.
the
union
patrol
man
will
talk
to
the
department
head
and
one
is
the
chief
mate
or
the
chief
engineer,
the
chief
steward
and
they
went
under
--
and
they
will
resolve
it
there.
if
this
can't
be
done
it
will
be
referred
to
the
contracting
officer,
contracting
enforcement
officer
at
the
union
headquarters
and
it
will
endeavor
to
be
resolved
there
between
the
contract
enforcement
officer
and
the
company
representative
and
the
company
office,
and
it
usually
would
be
done
if
not
then
it
would
go
on
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitration
finding.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
trace
into
the
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
was
entered
into
between
the
national
maritime
union
and
the
employer.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
have
endeavored
to
do
so
both
in
my
brief
and
in
the
outline
in
those
sections
in
our
single
appendix
we
have
referred
to
them.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
the
articles
contain
the
statutory
provisions
under
which
the
man
joins
the
vessel
and
they
do
set
forth
title
46
u.s.c.a.
596.
however,
the
conditions
under
which
he
worked
on
the
vessel,
the
nature
of
his
duties,
the
nature
of
overtime
which
is
not
covered
in
the
articles
is
determined
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
and
the
restriction
to
ship
which
he
is
talking
about
here
for
those
11
days
when
pratique
was
not
granted
off
at
cap
st.
jacques
would
be
something
that
has
been
created
a
right
given
to
him
by
the
contract
not
by
the
articles.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
true
and
this
is
our
position
and
in
reading
the
decisions
in
this
court
it
appears
that
the
court
has
gone
to
great
lengths
to
give
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
force
almost
of
law,
i
read
the
phrases
of
the
common
law
of
the
contract
and
the
code
of
the
industry
and
here
we
have
the
maritime
industry
that
operates
many,
many
vessels
generally
we're
talking
about
a
number
of
the
unions
as
well
as
the
number
of
companies
and
number
of
management
organizations.
and
they
have
endeavor
to
setup
a
practical
basis
on
which
to
keep
the
vessels
operating
smoothly.
determine
the
rights
of
the
union
members
especially
in
this
overtime
and
perhaps
restriction
to
ship
area
where
overtime
would
be
involved
and
provide
a
uniform
expeditious
basis
for
resolving
these
claim.
now,
if
you
go
to
litigation
and
you
come
into
the
u.s.
district
court
every
time
the
man
says,
“well,
the
chief
officer
didn't
allow
my
overtime.”
you'll
have
a
lot
of
cases.
you'll
also
have
lack
of
uniformity
and
resolution
because
the
men
in
the
union
and
in
the
company
offices
are
very
familiar
with
the
ships
and
their
operations.
and
the
conditions
under
which
his
claims
may
arise.
the
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
he
did.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
mr.
arguelles,
the
respondent
in
this
case
returned
to
galveston
which
was
at
port
of
saigon.
if
i
understand,
his
testimony
in
the
pre-trial
deposition
ordinarily
signed
the
ship
out
of
baltimore.
and
in
going
to
the
union
agent,
in
galveston,
i
think
the
first
problem
perhaps
was
to
resolve
this
question
of
the
restriction
to
ship
and
whether
it
was
justified
and
the
best
man
to
determine
is,
are
given
the
information
on
the
conditions
of
saigon
and
that
this
anchorage
where
the
ship
was
held
would
be
the
port
agent
in
yokohama.
now,
in
writing
to
him,
they
would
get
perhaps
an
authoritative
expression
on
whether
the
restriction
of
the
ship
was
in
fact
a
condition
of
matter
and
whether
the
basis
of
his
claim
that
he
was
entitled
to
eight
hours
a
day
overtime
for
those
11
days
when
they
couldn't
get
off
the
ship
was
justified.
the
idea
of
him
writing
to
the
agent
would
allow
an
opportunity
for
the
reply
from
japan
come
back
to
mr.
arguelles
at
baltimore.
he
apparently
not
living
in
galveston
and
not
regularly
shipping
out
of
galveston
made
it
base
of
operations
in
baltimore.
and
in
any
event,
under
that
article
ii,
section
2
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
that
advice,
it
says
as
you
read
down
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
further
merit
of
the
head
office
of
the
union
if
he
didn't
want
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
agent
in
galveston
which
apparently
he
didn't
do,
but
he
didn't
do
anything
else.
he
went
back
baltimore.
he
engaged
counsel
and
ultimately
brought
this
law
suit
which
gave
rise
to
the
problems
we
have
here.
now,
again,
i
go
back
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
similar
problems
in
other
industries
and
it
seems
that
in
the
following
the
provisions
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
section
301
(a)
that
it
is
desirable
to
have
these
things
resolved
between
the
companies
and
the
union
in
accordance
with
their
contract.
and
i
think
perhaps
one
thing
that
disturbed
the
fourth
circuit
more
than
anything
else
was
the
time-honored
concept
that
it
seems
is
award
of
the
(inaudible)
and
therefore
a
person
to
be
protected.
but
in
these
instances
you
have
on
one
side
a
very
powerful
union.
you
have
a
very
effective
labor
management
relations
system
working
in
the
maritime
industry
and
it
seems
that
at
least
to
make
an
exception
in
this
type
situation
to
let
the
parties
to
the
agreement
endeavor
to
work
this
out
and
i
think
they're
best
qualified
to
do
so.
now,
as
in
the
maddox
case
and
the
vaca
versus
sipes
case
decision
to
this
court,
it
was
suggested
that
the
effort
they
made
to
resolve
in
the
court's
grievance
procedure
before
litigation
would
be
resorted
to
and
perhaps,
that
is
what
you
had
mind
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
did
he
get
a
fair
treatment,
adequate
treatment
to
the
hands
of
his
union.
i
think
what
he
did
here;
he
didn't
give
the
union
really
a
chance
to
take
the
matter
up.
i
think
he
just
dropped
it
when
he
said,
right
yokohama,
he
didn't
take
any
further
and
i
think
he
should've.
he
eventually
engaged
counsel
and
the
counsel
was
certainly
been
qualified
to
take
the
matter
up
form
with
the
union
and
that
wasn't
done
instead
he
started
a
lawsuit.
and
really
in
granting
summary
judgment
to
district
court,
i
think
the
district
court
judge
reach
the
conclusion,
there
is
really
no
dispute
on
this
point
that
he
didn't
pursue
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
that's
why
to
summary
judgment
was
justified.
now,
today
again
with
shipping
industry
operating
all
over
the
world,
men
leading
ships
engaged
in
foreign
ports.
i
think
uniform
procedures
are
most
important
and
you
should
have
a
system
on
which
everyone
may
rely
and
expect
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
predictability
in
the
result
which
is
why
it
becomes
important.
i
believe,
to
follow
the
grievance
procedure
and
the
arbitration
procedure
set
up
in
the
agreement.
this
is
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
this
is
what
would
best
serve
the
needs
of
the
industry
generally.
we're
trying
to
strengthen
our
american
merchant
marines
what
remains
important
factor.
mr.
gibson,
the
secretary
of
state
for
commerce
recently
at
the
international
labor
organization
meeting
in
geneva
was
quoted
to
saying,
“that
the
american
seaman
today
enjoy
the
highest
wages
of
all
seaman
in
the
world
and
have
better
living
conditions
and
working
condition
on
the
ship
because
the
free
atmosphere
of
collective-bargaining.”
i
think
it's
a
desirable
result
to
uphold
the
agreement
and
that
basis
which
the
parties
of
the
agreement
wanted
to
utilize
to
resolve
their
differences.
litigation
is
always
there
as
the
last
resort,
but
really
that's
what
it
should
be
a
last
resort,
first
effort
should
be
made.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
if
i
may
then
i
would
like
to
say
something.
the
facts
of
the
case
in
so
far
as
lining
with
the
596
and
the
pay
off,
there
was
really
--
we've
always
contended
on
the
merits.
there
was
no
delay
in
this
case.
the
statute
provides
that
the
payment
of
wages
assuming
that
we're
talking
about
everything
that
is
concededly
due
to
the
man
may
be
made
within
four
days
after
the
discharge
or
within
24
hours
after
cargo
has
find
to
discharge
in
the
vessel.
now,
mr.
arguelles
and
this
is
in
his
deposition
which
is
set
forth
on
that
[voice
overlap].
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
but
they
made
the
certain
illusion
that
it
was
on
the
company
agent's,
a
dilatory
tactic
that
he
wasn't
paid
properly
in
galveston.
actually,
he
was
in
galveston
the
19th
based
on
his
testimony
and
he
didn't
go
the
company's
agent's
office
on
the
--
on
his
own.
he
took
the
time
himself
rather
than
go
over
there.
he
could've
been
paid
off
within
24
hours
that
the
cargo
was
out
of
the
vessel.
the
cargo
was
completely
discharged
on
the
18th
at
saigon.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
we'll
do
our
best
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
a
steamship
operator
has
sought
to
review
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
divided
decision
which
reversed
the
u.s.
district
court
in
the
city
of
baltimore.
the
case
involves
an
essence
whether
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
was
negotiated
by
the
national
maritime
union
with
the
steamship
employer
will
be
the
basis
upon
which
the
disputes
that
have
arisen
and
are
referred
to
in
this
case
will
be
resolved.
the
initial
cause
of
action
as
stated
by
the
respondent
in
the
district
court
sought
to
recover
firstly
a
transportation
differential
between
first
class
and
second
class
transportation.
that
was
resolved
before
the
case
ever
got
to
its
final
posture
in
the
district
court.
the
next
item
in
his
claims
involved
certain
overtime
earnings
that
he
said,
he
was
entitled
to,
but
had
not
been
paid
and
these
were
disputed
by
the
master
of
the
vessel
the
time
he
signed
of
articles
in
the
port
of
saigon.
the
third
issue
involves
alleged
penalties
to
which
he
refers
as
a
source
of
entitlement
46
u.s.c.a.
section
596.
now,
to
see
this
case
more
or
less
in
the
posture,
i'd
like
to
review
briefly
the
facts.
mr.
arguelles,
american
merchant
seaman
was
engaged
in
the
court
of
galveston,
texas
on
august
3,
1965,
to
service
an
ordinary
seaman
aboard
the
ss
u.s.
pecos.
this
is
a
merchant
vessel.
it's
not
a
naval
vessel
despite
u.s.
in
the
title.
he
served
aboard
the
vessel
and
at
the
time
when
the
six
months
which
was
the
period
of
the
articles
he
signed
has
part
of
his
engagement
expired
on
february
3,
1966.
the
vessel
was
entering
an
anchor
--
anchorage
off
of
cap
st.
jacques
which
is
just
off
the
coast
of
south
vietnam.
the
vessel
was
destined
to
go
to
saigon
to
discharge
cargo
which
was
in
the
ship.
the
local
authorities
denied
pratique
--
they
didn't
deny
pratique,
they
just
didn't
run
it.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
vessel
couldn't
go
up
the
river
to
the
port
to
discharge
and
everyone
was
required
to
stay
on
the
vessel
until
pratique
was
granted.
this
is
a
form
of
clearance
to
establish
that
the
crew
is
healthy,
meets
the
quarantine
requirements
and
what
have
you.
on
february
13th,
pratique
was
granted
and
the
vessel
proceeded
up
the
river
to
saigon,
a
trip
of
some
seven
hours.
there
up
from
the
15th
cargo
discharge
was
started.
and
on
the
17th,
the
respondent,
in
the
company
of
17
other
men
asked
to
be
sign
off
articles.
they
were
referred
to
the
u.s.
consul
who
was
acting
in
that
court
in
the
capacity
of
shipping
commissioner
which
is
customarily
inform
ports
when
the
seaman
leave
the
ship.
the
men
were
given
a
payroll
voucher
which
outlined
the
earnings,
the
base
wages
and
overtime.
this
was
certified
by
the
consul
and
the
men
were
given
transportation
to
return
to
the
united
states,
a
dispute
arose
at
that
time.
the
men
wanted
to
be
paid
off
in
cash
because
of
the
situation
in
south
vietnam
and
the
currency
situation,
u.s.
currency
was
not
given
to
the
men.
they
were
allowed
$50
to
use
for
expenses
incidental
perhaps
to
travel
home.
because
of
the
dispute
that
arose,
the
men
respondent
included
mr.
kline.
they
left
the
next
day
and
based
on
the
testimony
of
the
respondent
in
his
pre-trial
deposition,
he
arrived
in
galveston
on
or
about
the
19th
of
february.
for
reasons
of
his
own
convenience
i
assumed,
he
didn't
report
to
the
company
agent
until
the
22nd
of
february
when
he
was
given
cash
as
certified
to
in
the
voucher.
it
is
his
claim
that
this
was
wrong,
he
shouldn't
been
paid
off
more
expeditiously
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
596.
the
failure
to
give
him
his
overtime
wages
was
likewise
a
failure
to
pay
earn
wages
even
though
they
have
been
disallowed
by
the
department
head
on
the
vessel
in
accordance
to
terms
and
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
further,
he
was
claiming
because
the
11
days
when
pratique
had
not
been
granted
at
the
anchorage
of
cap
st.
jacques,
that
he
was
unjustifiably
restricted
to
the
ship
and
it
was
entitled
additional
eight
days
or
rather
11
days
of
overtime,
eight
hours
a
day,
as
a
penalty.
it
gets
somewhat
confusing
in
analyzing
the
claim
for
penalties
due
to
it
appears
that
at
one
point
in
the
complaint
filed
the
district
court.
there
is
a
claim
of
double
a
day's
pay
as
provided
for
in
section
596
as
the
penalty.
on
top
of
the
penalty,
overtime
not
paid
the
rather
claim
for
restriction
to
ship
but
not
paid.
now,
our
position
in
essence
is
this,
that
all
of
the
claims
that
have
been
presented
here
are
based
on
the
terms
and
provision
to
collective-bargaining
agreement.
and
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
there
is
a
procedure
for
presenting
grievances,
a
procedure
for
arbitration
and
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
at
least
in
the
first
instance
based
on
the
decision
of
this
court,
he
is
required
to
pursue
those
procedures
to
get
the
remedy
available
if
he
is
entitle
rather
than
going
to
court
and
start
a
lawsuit.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
it
is
limited
to
the
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
the
statutory
penalty
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
if
the
employer
owed
the
overtime
and
was
late
in
paying
it
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
the
penalty
would
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
double
a
day's
pay
but
if
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
we
first
have
to
determine
the
overtime
is
due
now.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
then
there
would
be
no
basis
for
penalty
either
if
he
was
paid
unless
there
was
a
delay
beyond
the
theory.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
assume
you're
speaking
hypothetically
as
opposed
to
the
fact
of
this
particular
case
because
we
don't
concede
there
was
a
delay
in
this
case.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
if
i
may
read
from
section
--
article
xii
which
covers
this,
perhaps
we're
differing
on
terminology.
“in
case
a
dispute
arises
over
the
interpretation
of
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement,
whether
said
dispute
originates
on
board
ship
or
ashore,
the
union
agrees
to
take
the
matter
up
with
the
company
and
make
every
effort
to
adjust
the
said
dispute.
in
event
that
no
amicable
and
so
forth.”
this
would
pretty
much
be
resolve
to
the
disputes
arising
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
contract
itself
and
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
if
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
in
the
context
of
wages,
if
the
earned
wages
admittedly
due
to
a
man
were
not
paid.
i
don't
believe
the
contract
will
then
be
able
to
resolve
that
you
would
have
to
then
go
to
the
court
and
sue,
but
the
big
question
is
determining
under
the
contract
and
that's
what
i
think
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
whether
anything
is
due
in
the
first
instance.
if
the
money
itself
is
due
and
concededly
due
and
the
company
just
arbitrarily
refuses
the
pay
it,
i
think
the
man
then
has
of
cause
under
596
because
the
contract
doesn't
go
that
far.
but
before
you
can
even
get
to
anything
like
that
of
arbitrary
upon
payment,
one
has
to
first
determine
that
something
is
due
and
this
is
not
been
done
and
that's
where
i
believe
that
it's
very
important
that
grievance
procedure
be
pursued.
i
think
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
until
the
disputes
are
resolved
one
way
or
the
other
and
it
is
assumed
that
if
they're
resolve
in
favor
of
the
seaman,
the
wages
will
be
paid.
so,
it
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
the
penalty
in
that
instance.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
believe
the
decisions
have
held
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
overtime
wages
are
--
are
wages,
are
earnings
but
on
the
context
to
the
statutes.
so
there
wouldn't
be
any
distinction
between
the
base
wage
and
the
overtime
earnings.
once
it
is
determined,
the
overtime
earnings
are
due
if
they're
arbitrarily
would
held
beyond
the
period
provided
in
the
statute.
penalties
might
very
well
be
justified
unless
again
we
get
back
to
another
aspect
of
section
596
sufficient
cause.
if
it
can
be
shown
there
was
a
sufficient
cause
for
the
nonpayment
of
the
money
due
then
of
course
the
penalties
have
not
been
applied
in
most
instances.
this
court
in
johnson
versus
isbrandtsen
determines
the
case
that
doesn't
play
touch
the
facts
of
this
case
that
we're
dealing
here
determine
that
there
was
sufficient
cause
and
even
though
there
was
a
delay
in
the
payment
because
of
wrongful
withholding
of
certain
funds
out
of
earned
wages.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
think
that
purpose
where
money
is
due.
it
is
to
prevent
the
employer
from
being
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
paying
money
conceded
to
be
due
to
the
man.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
when
you
come
to
the
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
no,
but
there
may
be
sufficient
cause
if
that
is
resolve
then
we
come
to
another
problem
or
that
could
be
a
problem.
but
what
is
being
claimed
here.
these
overtimes
and
restrictions
to
ship
under
the
conditions
that
are
endeavored
to
describe
create
rights
that
were
created
by
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
themselves.
therefore,
if
there
is
a
dispute,
we
submit
it
should
be
resolve
on
the
basis
of
the
grievance
procedure,
any
arbitration
procedure
in
the
contract.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
agreement
that
would
provide
that
the
agreement
merely
provides
that
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
would
lead
to
the
payment.
the
union
will
refer
to
the
matters
of
the
company
for
payment.
you
see,
as
a
practical
matter
what
happens
when
these
ships
pay
off
at
the
end
of
a
voyage,
it
usually
have
a
union
patrolman
aboard
and
the
individual
crew
members
that
has
a
problem
he
says,
well
he
works
certain
overtime
that's
not
being
allowed.
the
union
patrol
man
will
talk
to
the
department
head
and
one
is
the
chief
mate
or
the
chief
engineer,
the
chief
steward
and
they
went
under
--
and
they
will
resolve
it
there.
if
this
can't
be
done
it
will
be
referred
to
the
contracting
officer,
contracting
enforcement
officer
at
the
union
headquarters
and
it
will
endeavor
to
be
resolved
there
between
the
contract
enforcement
officer
and
the
company
representative
and
the
company
office,
and
it
usually
would
be
done
if
not
then
it
would
go
on
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitration
finding.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
trace
into
the
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
was
entered
into
between
the
national
maritime
union
and
the
employer.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
i
have
endeavored
to
do
so
both
in
my
brief
and
in
the
outline
in
those
sections
in
our
single
appendix
we
have
referred
to
them.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
the
articles
contain
the
statutory
provisions
under
which
the
man

and
they
do

forth

u.s.c.a.
596.
however,
the
conditions
under
which
he
worked
on
the
vessel,
the
nature
of
his
duties,
the
nature
of
overtime
which
is
not
covered
in
the
articles
is
determined
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
and
the
restriction
to
ship
which
he
is
talking
about
here
for
those
11
days
when
pratique
was
not
granted
off
at
cap
st.
jacques
would
be
something
that
has
been
created
a
right
given
to
him
by
the
contract
not
by
the
articles.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
true
and
this
is
our
position
and
in
reading
the
decisions
in
this
court
it
appears
that
the
court
has
gone
to
great
lengths
to
give
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
force
almost
of
law,
i
read
the
phrases
of
the
common
law
of
the
contract
and
the
code
of
the
industry
and
here
we
have
the
maritime
industry
that
operates
many,
many
vessels
generally
we're
talking
about
a
number
of
the
unions
as
well
as
the
number
of
companies
and
number
of
management
organizations.
and
they
have
endeavor
to
setup
a
practical
basis
on
which
to
keep
the
vessels
operating
smoothly.
determine
the
rights
of
the
union
members
especially
in
this
overtime
and
perhaps
restriction
to
ship
area
where
overtime
would
be
involved
and
provide
a
uniform
expeditious
basis
for
resolving
these
claim.
now,
if
you
go
to
litigation
and
you
come
into
the
u.s.
district
court
every
time
the
man
says,
“well,
the
chief
officer
didn't
allow
my
overtime.”
you'll
have
a
lot
of
cases.
you'll
also
have
lack
of
uniformity
and
resolution
because
the
men
in
the
union
and
in
the
company
offices
are
very
familiar
with
the
ships
and
their
operations.
and
the
conditions
under
which
his
claims
may
arise.
the
--
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
yes,
he
did.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
mr.
arguelles,
the
respondent
in
this
case
returned
to
galveston
which
was
at
port
of
saigon.
if
i
understand,
his
testimony
in
the
pre-trial
deposition
ordinarily
signed
the
ship
out
of
baltimore.
and
in
going
to
the
union
agent,
in
galveston,
i
think
the
first
problem
perhaps
was
to
resolve
this
question
of
the
restriction
to
ship
and
whether
it
was
justified
and
the
best
man
to
determine
is,
are
given
the
information
on
the
conditions
of
saigon
and
that
this
anchorage
where
the
ship
was
held
would
be
the
port
agent
in
yokohama.
now,
in
writing
to
him,
they
would
get
perhaps
an
authoritative
expression
on
whether
the
restriction
of
the
ship
was
in
fact
a
condition
of
matter
and
whether
the
basis
of
his
claim
that
he
was
entitled
to
eight
hours
a
day
overtime
for
those
11
days
when
they
couldn't
get
off
the
ship
was
justified.
the
idea
of
him
writing
to
the
agent
would
allow
an
opportunity
for
the
reply
from
japan
come
back
to
mr.
arguelles
at
baltimore.
he
apparently
not
living
in
galveston
and
not
regularly
shipping
out
of
galveston
made
it
base
of
operations
in
baltimore.
and
in
any
event,
under
that
article
ii,
section
2
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
that
advice,
it
says
as
you
read
down
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
further
merit
of
the
head
office
of
the
union
if
he
didn't
want
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
agent
in
galveston
which
apparently
he
didn't
do,
but
he
didn't
do
anything
else.
he
went
back
baltimore.
he
engaged
counsel
and
ultimately
brought
this
law
suit
which
gave
rise
to
the
problems
we
have
here.
now,
again,
i
go
back
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
similar
problems
in
other
industries
and
it
seems
that
in
the
following
the
provisions
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
section
301
(a)
that
it
is
desirable
to
have
these
things
resolved
between
the
companies
and
the
union
in
accordance
with
their
contract.
and
i
think
perhaps
one
thing
that
disturbed
the
fourth
circuit
more
than
anything
else
was
the
time-honored
concept
that
it
seems
is
award
of
the
(inaudible)
and
therefore
a
person
to
be
protected.
but
in
these
instances
you
have
on
one
side
a
very
powerful
union.
you
have
a
very
effective
labor
management
relations
system
working
in
the
maritime
industry
and
it
seems
that
at
least
to
make
an
exception
in
this
type
situation
to
let
the
parties
to
the
agreement
endeavor
to
work
this
out
and
i
think
they're
best
qualified
to
do
so.
now,
as
in
the
maddox
case
and
the
vaca
versus
sipes
case
decision
to
this
court,
it
was
suggested
that
the
effort
they
made
to
resolve
in
the
court's
grievance
procedure
before
litigation
would
be
resorted
to
and
perhaps,
that
is
what
you
had
mind
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
did
he
get
a
fair
treatment,
adequate
treatment
to
the
hands
of
his
union.
i
think
what
he
did
here;
he
didn't
give
the
union
really
a
chance
to
take
the
matter
up.
i
think
he
just
dropped
it
when
he
said,
right
yokohama,
he
didn't
take
any
further
and
i
think
he
should've.
he
eventually
engaged
counsel
and
the
counsel
was
certainly
been
qualified
to
take
the
matter
up
form
with
the
union
and
that
wasn't
done
instead
he
started
a
lawsuit.
and
really
in
granting
summary
judgment
to
district
court,
i
think
the
district
court
judge
reach
the
conclusion,
there
is
really
no
dispute
on
this
point
that
he
didn't
pursue
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
that's
why
to
summary
judgment
was
justified.
now,
today
again
with
shipping
industry
operating
all
over
the
world,
men
leading
ships
engaged
in
foreign
ports.
i
think
uniform
procedures
are
most
important
and
you
should
have
a
system
on
which
everyone
may
rely
and
expect
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
predictability
in
the
result
which
is
why
it
becomes
important.
i
believe,
to
follow
the
grievance
procedure
and
the
arbitration
procedure
set
up
in
the
agreement.
this
is
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
this
is
what
would
best
serve
the
needs
of
the
industry
generally.
we're
trying
to
strengthen
our
american
merchant
marines
what
remains
important
factor.
mr.
gibson,
the
secretary
of
state
for
commerce
recently
at
the
international
labor
organization
meeting
in
geneva
was
quoted
to
saying,
“that
the
american
seaman
today
enjoy
the
highest
wages
of
all
seaman
in
the
world
and
have
better
living
conditions
and
working
condition
on
the
ship
because
the
free
atmosphere
of
collective-bargaining.”
i
think
it's
a
desirable
result
to
uphold
the
agreement
and
that
basis
which
the
parties
of
the
agreement
wanted
to
utilize
to
resolve
their
differences.
litigation
is
always
there
as
the
last
resort,
but
really
that's
what
it
should
be
a
last
resort,
first
effort
should
be
made.
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
well,
if
i
may
then
i
would
like
to
say
something.
the
facts
of
the
case
in
so
far
as
lining
with
the
596
and
the
pay
off,
there
was
really
--
we've
always
contended
on
the
merits.
there
was
no
delay
in
this
case.
the
statute
provides
that
the
payment
of
wages
assuming
that
we're
talking
about
everything
that
is
concededly
due
to
the
man
may
be
made
within
four
days
after
the
discharge
or
within
24
hours
after
cargo
has
find
to
discharge
in
the
vessel.
now,
mr.
arguelles
and
this
is
in
his
deposition
which
is
set
forth
on
that
[voice
overlap].
mr.
george
w.
sullivan
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
but
they
made
the
certain
illusion
that
it
was
on
the
company
agent's,
a
dilatory
tactic
that
he
wasn't
paid
properly
in
galveston.
actually,
he
was
in
galveston
the
19th
based
on
his
testimony
and
he
didn't
go
the
company's
agent's
office
on
the
--
on
his
own.
he
took
the
time
himself
rather
than
go
over
there.
he
could've
been
paid
off
within
24
hours
that
the
cargo
was
out
of
the
vessel.
the
cargo
was
completely
discharged
on
the
18th
at
saigon.
