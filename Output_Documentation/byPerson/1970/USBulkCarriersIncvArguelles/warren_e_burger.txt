mr.
sullivan,
i'm
sure
that
you
and
your
friend
probably
realize
that
if
you
want
to
get
back
to
new
york,
one
way
to
do
it
--
to
new
york
and
baltimore
respectively,
one
way
to
do
it
is
to
finish
up
this
rapidly
as
you
can.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
kind
of
disputes
would
arise
that
would
not
be
covered
under
that
clause,
could
you
suggest
a
hypothesis
that
could
cover
all
conditions?
chief

e.
burger
wages,
hours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
there
a
strong
policy
reason
underlying
the
statutory
penalty?
i
think
in
terms
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
terms
of
protecting
a
seaman
who
doesn't
carry
much
of
a
reserve
as
a
businessman
does,
isn't
that
part
of
the
statutory
scheme?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
really
--
isn't
it
broader
than
that
that
it's
to
prevent
the
employer
from
delay
in
payment
of
money
dues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
main
difference
whether
it's
arbitrary
or
capricious
under
the
statute,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
avnet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
no
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
by
the
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
six
months
expiration
date
comes
at
the
time
they
are
in
the
foreign
court,
does
the
seaman
have
a
right
to
insist
upon
the
extending
the
articles
until
he
is
at
his
home
port
or
can
the
master
of
this
vessel
terminate
the
men
in
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
he
wants
to
stay
on,
but
the
captain
wants
to
terminate
him
and
my
question
is,
may
he
be
terminated
in
a
foreign
port?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sure
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
you're
emphasizing
these
facts
on
the
theory
that
this
is
the
kind
of
the
recall
sequence
that
statute
was
intended
to
penalize?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice

part
of
that
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
grievance
procedure
and
the
arbitration
operates
to
have
power
of
subpoena?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
if
the
employer
wanted
to
engage
in
dilatory
tactics
and
not
having
there
master
or
others
available
or
didn't
want
to
take
their
depositions
they
could
delay
at
an
arbitration
that
could
be
longer
than
you
could
do
it
in
federal
court
by
the
power
of
subpoena.
