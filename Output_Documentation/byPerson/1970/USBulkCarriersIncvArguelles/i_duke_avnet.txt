mr.
i.
duke
avnet
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
just
to
say
a
few
additional
facts
here
before
going
in
the
argument.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
statute
provides
that
in
the
foreign
voyage,
the
seaman
is
entitled
to
be
paid
off
within
24
hours
after
the
cargo
was
discharged
or
within
four
days
after
he
is
discharged
and
for
not
doing
so,
the
ship
is
liable
for
two
days'
pay
for
each
day
of
delay.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
and
that
the
wages
should
be
recoverable
“as
wages
in
any
claim
made
before
the
court.”
then
there's
another
section
597
which
provides
that
were
a
seaman
asked
for
a
draw
in
any
port,
he
must
be
paid
a
portion
of
his
wages
due,
a
third,
otherwise
the
whole
amount
becomes
due
and
he
entitled
to
be
discharged.
now,
in
this
case
mr.
arguelles,
the
seaman
went
first
to
saigon
during
the
six-month
period
of
the
shipping
articles,
and
then
went
back
to
taiwan
to
take
on
another
cargo
and
the
six
months
was
about
to
expire.
and
one
day
before
the
six-month
period
that
is
on
february
2,
1966,
mr.
arguelles
asked
the
captain
to
be
discharged.
the
captain
said,
no
and
he
said,
“well
i'd
like
my
draw”
and
the
captain
said,
“no.”
reading
between
the
lines,
it
is
obvious
here
that
the
captain
did
not
wish
to
lose
mr.
arguelles
and
intended
to
keep
beyond
the
six-month
period
of
his
articles
knowing
that
by
the
time
the
ship
drop
to
saigon
or
near
saigon
that
the
six
months
would
have
be
expired
and
it's
still
have
the
services
of
mr.
arguelles
even
though
mr.
arguelles
no
longer
want
to
serve
beyond
the
six-month
period.
i
like
to
point
out
it's
not
a
case
of
man
who
didn't
want
to
go
to
saigon,
the
thing
he
agreed
to
do
he
and
already
been
there,
but
because
the
articles
were
about
to
expire
he
won't
get
off
the
ship
and
get
paid.
when
the
vessel
arrived
in
cap
st.
jacques
which
was
on
the
third,
the
day
the
articles
expired,
he
again
asked
to
be
discharged
and
be
paid
off
and
again
it
was
refused.
now,
assuming
that
the
ship
was
not
granted
clearance
that
is
that
the
crew
was
not
granted
surely,
there
was
no
objection
apparently
to
the
agent
coming
aboard
with
an
american
counsel
if
necessary
so
that
the
man
who
want
to
get
paid
off
and
his
articles
had
expired
could
be
paid
off,
but
the
captain
didn't
want
that.
apparently,
reading
between
the
lines,
he
wants
to
keep
that
crew
on
that
ship
or
maybe
it's
because
he
couldn't
get
replacements
or
was
difficult
to
get
replacements.
but
be
that
is
not
made
this
violated
the
articles
so
far
as
mr.
arguelles
is
concerned
because
he
was
there
only
on
six-month
articles
and
there
were
forced
of
keeping
him
there
beyond
that.
well,
therein
we're
confined
that
the
ship
then
in
that
cap
st.
jacques
for
period
of
some
10
or
11
days
and
finally
the
ship
was
moved
up
the
river
toward
the
port
of
saigon,
the
harbor
of
saigon.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
yes,
sir.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
the
usual
procedure
on
a
risk
for
the
man
to
decide
whether
he
want
to
continue
on
and
then
he
resigns
articles
or
if
he
decided
he
doesn't
want
to
continue
on
then
he
is
paid
off
right
there
and
the
captain
replaces
him
with
someone
else.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
i
would
think
so.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
because
the
article
says,
it's
only
for
six
months.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
then
of
course,
it's
a
practical
measure,
he
would
be
continued
on
until
they
reach
the
next
port
and
then
be
paid
off
of
that
next
port.
well,
when
the
vessel
arrived
then
in
saigon,
now
this
is
on
the
13th
of
february.
again,
he
asked
to
be
discharged
and
be
paid
off
and
again
he
was
refused,
that
being
the
obvious
intention
of
the
captain
to
keep
him
aboard
their
regardless
of
the
articles
and
regardless
of
what
his
wishes
were.
finally,
it
was
on
the
17th
that
mr.
arguelles
was
finally
permitted
to
leave
the
ship
and
then
instead
of
being
paid
in
american
dollars
as
the
law
requires
that
he
was
paid
by
simply
a
voucher
and
given
$50
and
the
answer
was
given
not
there
but
here.
later
on,
that
was
their
policy
not
to
do
it.
now,
there's
no
proof
that
there
was
any
law
that
forbade
the
payment
in
american
dollars
in
saigon.
there's
no
proof
in
the
record
at
all.
on
the
contrary,
mr.
arguelles
testified
and
that's
the
only
testimony
we
have
here,
direct
testimony
namely
that
he
thought
he
was
entitled
be
paid
all
fairness,
prompted
an
argument
between
him
and
the
american
consul
and
some
of
the
other
seamen
that
wish
to
paid
off.
then
they
flew
him
to
the
states
and
there
he
had
to
wait
for
approximately
three
days
before
the
company
decides
to
pay
him
off.
now,
the
evidence
is
clear
contrary
to
what
my
brother
has
stated
that
he
waited
there
to
be
paid.
he
didn't
wait
around
and
go
direct
to
draw
to
the
office.
he
was
not
paid
by
the
company
until
the
22nd
when
the
others
were
paid
off.
now,
these
were
the
facts
in
the
case
and
then
the
man
said,
“you
haven't
to
pay
me
all
of
my
overtime.”
they
said,
“well,
you
have
to
go
to
your
union,
he
went
to
his
union.
the
union
says,
you
go
to
yokohama,
now
of
course
this
is
the
futile
thing
for
him
to
do,
he
couldn't
negotiate
to
with
yokohama
or
the
delegate
there
and
contrary
to
what
my
brother
says,
it
is
the
job
of
the
union
to
take
the
matter
off
on
a
higher
level
if
there
has
--
the
grievance
has
not
been
settled
in
the
local
port.
now,
grievance,
the
contract
says,
must
be
settled
in
an
american
continental
port
or
in
the
final
port
of
discharge
here
being
houston,
or
that
american
continental
port
which
would
have
been
also
houston.
now,
this
is
where
it
should
have
been
settled,
but
it
wasn't
settled
here
and
that
was
for
the
union
to
take
it
up
but
not
this
man
because
this
man
wasn't
getting
any
relief
from
this
union
and
therefore
he
came
to
me
and
after
i
wrote
to
the
company
trying
to
get
them
to
pay
the
man,
they
refuse
and
i
finally
took
it
to
court.
now,
these
are
the
facts
in
the
case,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice
and
to
answer
now
justice
stewart's
question
it
is
true
that
the
amount
of
the
overtime,
the
rate
of
the
overtime
is
fixed
by
the
collective-bargaining
contract,
but
the
remedy
your
honor
is
given
by
the
statute.
and
this
is
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
yes,
sir.
he
has
two
remedies
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
that's
correct
sir
and
the
question
arises
therefore
whether
the
collective-bargaining
remedy
is
a
mandatory
substitute
for
the
statutory
remedy.
we
say
no,
we
say
the
man
could
pursue
either
one
of
the
remedies.
now,
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
significantly
pointed
out
that
just
precisely
to
overcome
an
abuse
such
as
occurred
here
and
that
is
where
the
union
subjects
the
man
who
are
futile
--
to
a
futile
result.
that
is
to
try
to
contact
that
region
in
the
foreign
port
that
in
that
kind
of
a
contingency,
the
man
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
court
and
get
relief
which
is
guaranteed
by
that
statute.
and
of
course
that
statute
is
in
the
interest
of
making
and
building
a
strong
merchant
marine
for
the
defense
of
the
contrary
and
for
a
solid,
a
mercantile
development
in
our
country
with
regard
for
merchant
marine
as
was
indicated
by
this
court
in
a
decision
written
by
this
court
fairly
reasonably
which
i
cited
in
my
brief.
now,
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
the
statute
originated
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
the
statute
originated
mr.
justice
about
1790
and
there
was
amended
about
1915
in
its
present
form
and
this
has
been
the
policy
this
statute
was
based
of
course
upon
policy
to
have
a
strong
merchant
marine
dating
from
the
back
--
back
of
day
of
the
revolution.
i
would
like
to
point
out
now
at
this
point
that
mr.
sullivan,
my
opponent
is
arguing
that
there's
no
need
now
for
this
type
of
statute
because
the
american
seaman
are
much
better
of
than
they
were
a
century
ago.
i
don't
argue
with
him
that
they
are
better
off
now
and
that
that
is
due
to
the
collective-bargaining
machinery.
however,
it
is
not
is
in
his
good
situation
that's
counsel
would
had
you
believed.
today,
the
passenger
vessel
trade
for
--
there's
american
passenger
vessel
trade
as
very
much
off,
this
people
are
having
difficult
times
which
means
and
that
seaman
may
be
subjected
to
delay
in
payment
of
their
wages
or
nonpayment.
we
have
a
number
of
marginal
shippers
in
the
merchant
marine
today,
people
owning
one
ship
or
two
ships
who
are
making
their
profit
through
trade
in
the
saigon
run.
now,
where
unwinding
of
that
war,
at
the
end
of
that
war
obviously,
these
small
companies
are
going
to
be
in
financial
restraints.
and
these
seamen
then
will
suffer
as
consequence
because
they
will
be
delay
in
payment
and
which
will
mean
no
payment
at
all
eventually.
and
so,
it
isn't
important
to
have
this
two
for
one
specter
facing
the
shipowner
or
ship
operator
so
that
he
will
know
that
those
wages
must
be
paid
promptly
in
order
to
encourage
these
men
to
go
the
sea.
we're
having
a
number
of
mergers
today
and
people
don't
let
know
who
their
employer
is
and
in
this
instances
there
are
delays
and
none
payment
of
wages
compelling
the
men
to
go
to
the
court
under
the
statute.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
on
the
first
place
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
that
the
grievance
machinery
would
necessarily
work
any
faster
because
in
this
particular
industry
where
you
have
the
(inaudible)
involved
being
out
at
sea
whether
it
be
on
the
company
side
or
in
the
workman
side,
these
cases
are
long
handling.
now,
until
he
gets
parties
together
until
he
can
be
heard
particularly
in
our
arbitration
case
that
takes
a
long
time.
and
this
conserve
with
grumbling
about
this
in
the
industry
[voice
overlap].
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
well,
it
yes,
your
honor
because
usually
they
don't
go
this
long
or
this
far.
they
don't
flock
in
united
states
supreme
court,
they
usually
terminate
[voice
overlap].
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
but
they
usually
they
end
up
in
the
district
court
and
doesn't
grow
up
on
appeal.
to
answer
your
other
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
true
that
an
arbitrator
could
do
that
but
is
impose
of
penalty
of
241,
but
i
have
never
seen
it
done
and
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
arbitrator
would
do
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
grievance
procedure
that
would
require
them
to
do
that.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
he
didn't
do
what
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
you
mean
the
arbitrator?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
if
he
didn't
--
you
mean
recognize
the
grievance
of
the
seaman?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
and
then
the
saigon's
favor
then
the
court
a
seaman
wouldn't
get
anything
and
that
he'd
come
away
empty
handed
[voice
overlap]
and
that
would
be
controlling.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
i
doubt
could
then
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
because
if
he
did
then
there
would
be
nothing
due
him
because
he
had
agreed
to
go
into
the
arbitration
proceeding.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
not
that
i
know
of.
no,
sir.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
that's
correct
sir.
and
so
i
think
your
honors
that
discuss
to
leave
the
law
as
is
and
if
they
want
to
substitute
the
collective-bargaining
remedy
for
the
statute,
i
think
the
place
to
do
that
is
in
the
congress
and
not
to
come
here
and
ask
your
honors
to
do
that
and
i
think
it's
solitary
that
we
have
both
remedies
so
that
the
seaman
can
choose
which
one
he
wants.
thank
you.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
just
to
say
a
few
additional
facts
here
before
going
in
the
argument.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
statute
provides
that
in
the
foreign
voyage,
the
seaman
is
entitled
to
be
paid
off
within
24
hours
after
the
cargo
was
discharged
or
within
four
days
after
he
is
discharged
and
for
not
doing
so,
the
ship
is
liable
for
two
days'
pay
for
each
day
of
delay.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
and
that
the
wages
should
be
recoverable
“as
wages
in
any
claim
made
before
the
court.”
then
there's
another
section
597
which
provides
that
were
a
seaman
asked
for
a
draw
in
any
port,
he
must
be
paid
a
portion
of
his
wages
due,
a
third,
otherwise
the
whole
amount
becomes
due
and
he
entitled
to
be
discharged.
now,
in
this
case
mr.
arguelles,
the
seaman
went
first
to
saigon
during
the
six-month
period
of
the
shipping
articles,
and
then
went
back
to
taiwan
to
take
on
another
cargo
and
the
six
months
was
about
to
expire.
and
one
day
before
the
six-month
period
that
is
on
february
2,
1966,
mr.
arguelles
asked
the
captain
to
be
discharged.
the
captain
said,
no
and
he
said,
“well
i'd
like
my
draw”
and
the
captain
said,
“no.”
reading
between
the
lines,
it
is
obvious
here
that
the
captain
did
not
wish
to
lose
mr.
arguelles
and
intended
to
keep
beyond
the
six-month
period
of
his
articles
knowing
that
by
the
time
the
ship
drop
to
saigon
or
near
saigon
that
the
six
months
would
have
be
expired
and
it's
still
have
the
services
of
mr.
arguelles
even
though
mr.
arguelles
no
longer
want
to
serve
beyond
the
six-month
period.
i
like
to
point
out
it's
not
a
case
of
man
who
didn't
want
to
go
to
saigon,
the
thing
he
agreed
to
do
he
and
already
been
there,
but
because
the
articles
were
about
to
expire
he
won't
get
off
the
ship
and
get
paid.
when
the
vessel
arrived
in
cap
st.
jacques
which
was
on
the
third,
the
day
the
articles
expired,
he
again
asked
to
be
discharged
and
be
paid
off
and
again
it
was
refused.
now,
assuming
that
the
ship
was
not
granted
clearance
that
is
that
the
crew
was
not
granted
surely,
there
was
no
objection
apparently
to
the
agent
coming
aboard
with
an
american
counsel
if
necessary
so
that
the
man
who
want
to
get
paid
off
and
his
articles
had
expired
could
be
paid
off,
but
the
captain
didn't
want
that.
apparently,
reading
between
the
lines,
he
wants
to
keep
that
crew
on
that
ship
or
maybe
it's
because
he
couldn't
get
replacements
or
was
difficult
to
get
replacements.
but
be
that
is
not
made
this
violated
the
articles
so
far
as
mr.
arguelles
is
concerned
because
he
was
there
only
on
six-month
articles
and
there
were
forced
of
keeping
him
there
beyond
that.
well,
therein
we're
confined
that
the
ship
then
in
that
cap
st.
jacques
for
period
of
some
10
or
11
days
and
finally
the
ship
was
moved
up
the
river
toward
the
port
of
saigon,
the
harbor
of
saigon.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
yes,
sir.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
the
usual
procedure
on
a
risk
for
the
man
to
decide
whether
he
want
to
continue
on
and
then
he
resigns
articles
or
if
he
decided
he
doesn't
want
to
continue
on
then
he
is
paid
off
right
there
and
the
captain
replaces
him
with
someone
else.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
i
would
think
so.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
because
the
article
says,
it's
only
for
six
months.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
then
of
course,
it's
a
practical
measure,
he
would
be
continued
on
until
they
reach
the
next
port
and
then
be
paid
off
of
that
next
port.
well,
when
the
vessel
arrived
then
in
saigon,
now
this
is
on
the
13th
of
february.
again,
he
asked
to
be
discharged
and
be
paid
off
and
again
he
was
refused,
that
being
the
obvious
intention
of
the
captain
to
keep
him
aboard
their
regardless
of
the
articles
and
regardless
of
what
his
wishes
were.
finally,
it
was
on
the
17th
that
mr.
arguelles
was
finally
permitted
to
leave
the
ship
and
then
instead
of
being
paid
in
american
dollars
as
the
law
requires
that
he
was
paid
by
simply
a
voucher
and
given
$50
and
the
answer
was
given
not
there
but
here.
later
on,
that
was
their
policy
not
to
do
it.
now,
there's
no
proof
that
there
was
any
law
that
forbade
the
payment
in
american
dollars
in
saigon.
there's
no
proof
in
the
record
at
all.
on
the
contrary,
mr.
arguelles
testified
and
that's
the
only
testimony
we
have
here,
direct
testimony
namely
that
he
thought
he
was
entitled
be
paid
all
fairness,
prompted
an
argument
between
him
and
the
american
consul
and
some
of
the
other
seamen
that
wish
to
paid
off.
then
they
flew
him
to
the
states
and
there
he
had
to
wait
for
approximately
three
days
before
the
company
decides
to
pay
him
off.
now,
the
evidence
is
clear
contrary
to
what
my
brother
has
stated
that
he
waited
there
to
be
paid.
he
didn't
wait
around
and
go
direct
to
draw
to
the
office.
he
was
not
paid
by
the
company
until
the
22nd
when
the
others
were
paid
off.
now,
these
were
the
facts
in
the
case
and
then
the
man
said,
“you
haven't
to
pay
me
all
of
my
overtime.”
they
said,
“well,
you
have
to
go
to
your
union,
he
went
to
his
union.
the
union
says,
you
go
to
yokohama,
now
of
course
this
is
the
futile
thing
for
him
to
do,
he
couldn't
negotiate
to
with
yokohama
or
the
delegate
there
and
contrary
to
what
my
brother
says,
it
is
the
job
of
the
union
to
take
the
matter
off
on
a
higher
level
if
there
has
--
the
grievance
has
not
been
settled
in
the
local
port.
now,
grievance,
the
contract
says,
must
be
settled
in
an
american
continental
port
or
in
the
final
port
of
discharge
here
being
houston,
or
that
american
continental
port
which
would
have
been
also
houston.
now,
this
is
where
it
should
have
been
settled,
but
it
wasn't
settled
here
and
that
was
for
the
union
to
take
it
up
but
not
this
man
because
this
man
wasn't
getting
any
relief
from
this
union
and
therefore
he
came
to
me
and
after
i
wrote
to
the
company
trying
to
get
them
to
pay
the
man,
they
refuse
and
i
finally
took
it
to
court.
now,
these
are
the
facts
in
the
case,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice
and
to
answer
now
justice
stewart's
question
it
is
true
that
the
amount
of
the
overtime,
the
rate
of
the
overtime
is
fixed
by
the
collective-bargaining
contract,
but
the
remedy
your
honor
is
given
by
the
statute.
and
this
is
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
yes,
sir.
he
has
two
remedies
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
that's
correct
sir
and
the
question
arises
therefore
whether
the
collective-bargaining
remedy
is
a
mandatory
substitute
for
the
statutory
remedy.
we
say
no,
we
say
the
man
could
pursue
either
one
of
the
remedies.
now,
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
significantly
pointed
out
that
just
precisely
to
overcome
an
abuse
such
as
occurred
here
and
that
is
where
the
union
subjects
the
man
who
are
futile
--
to
a
futile
result.
that
is
to
try
to
contact
that
region
in
the
foreign
port
that
in
that
kind
of
a
contingency,
the
man
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
court
and
get
relief
which
is
guaranteed
by
that
statute.
and
of
course
that
statute
is
in
the
interest
of
making
and
building
a
strong
merchant
marine
for
the
defense
of
the
contrary
and
for
a
solid,
a
mercantile
development
in
our
country
with
regard
for
merchant
marine
as
was
indicated
by
this
court
in
a
decision
written
by
this
court
fairly
reasonably
which
i
cited
in
my
brief.
now,
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
the
statute
originated
--
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
the
statute
originated
mr.
justice
about
1790
and
there
was
amended
about
1915
in
its
present
form
and
this
has
been
the
policy
this
statute
was
based
of
course
upon
policy
to
have
a
strong
merchant
marine
dating
from
the
back
--
back
of
day
of
the
revolution.
i
would
like
to
point
out
now
at
this
point
that
mr.
sullivan,
my
opponent
is
arguing
that
there's
no
need
now
for
this
type
of
statute
because
the
american
seaman
are
much
better
of
than
they
were
a
century
ago.
i
don't
argue
with
him
that
they
are
better
off
now
and
that
that
is
due
to
the
collective-bargaining
machinery.
however,
it
is
not
is
in
his
good
situation
that's
counsel
would
had
you
believed.
today,
the
passenger
vessel
trade
for
--
there's
american
passenger
vessel
trade
as
very
much
off,
this
people
are
having
difficult
times
which
means
and
that
seaman
may
be
subjected
to
delay
in
payment
of
their
wages
or
nonpayment.
we
have
a
number
of
marginal
shippers
in
the
merchant
marine
today,
people
owning
one
ship
or
two
ships
who
are
making
their
profit
through
trade
in
the
saigon
run.
now,
where
unwinding
of
that
war,
at
the
end
of
that
war
obviously,
these
small
companies
are
going
to
be
in
financial
restraints.
and
these
seamen
then
will
suffer
as
consequence
because
they
will
be
delay
in
payment
and
which
will
mean
no
payment
at
all
eventually.
and
so,
it
isn't
important
to
have
this
two
for
one
specter
facing
the
shipowner
or
ship
operator
so
that
he
will
know
that
those
wages
must
be
paid
promptly
in
order
to
encourage
these
men
to
go
the
sea.
we're
having
a
number
of
mergers
today
and
people
don't
let
know
who
their
employer
is
and
in
this
instances
there
are
delays
and
none
payment
of
wages
compelling
the
men
to
go
to
the
court
under
the
statute.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
on
the
first
place
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
that
the
grievance
machinery
would
necessarily
work
any
faster
because
in
this
particular
industry
where
you
have
the
(inaudible)
involved
being
out
at
sea
whether
it
be
on
the
company
side
or
in
the
workman
side,
these
cases
are
long
handling.
now,
until
he
gets
parties
together
until
he
can
be
heard
particularly
in
our
arbitration
case
that
takes
a
long
time.
and
this
conserve
with
grumbling
about
this
in
the
industry
[voice
overlap].
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
well,
it
yes,
your
honor
because
usually
they
don't
go
this
long
or
this
far.
they
don't
flock
in
united
states
supreme
court,
they
usually
terminate
[voice
overlap].
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
but
they
usually
they
end
up
in
the
district
court
and
doesn't
grow
up
on
appeal.
to
answer
your
other
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
true
that
an
arbitrator
could
do
that
but
is
impose
of
penalty
of
241,
but
i
have
never
seen
it
done
and
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
arbitrator
would
do
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
grievance
procedure
that
would
require
them
to
do
that.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
he
didn't
do
what
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
you
mean
the
arbitrator?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
if
he
didn't
--
you
mean
recognize
the
grievance
of
the
seaman?
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
and
then
the
saigon's
favor
then
the
court
a
seaman
wouldn't
get
anything
and
that
he'd
come
away
empty
handed
[voice
overlap]
and
that
would
be
controlling.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
i
doubt
could
then
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
because
if
he
did
then
there
would
be
nothing
due
him
because
he
had
agreed
to
go
into
the
arbitration
proceeding.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
not
that
i
know
of.
no,
sir.
mr.
i.
duke
avnet
that's
correct
sir.
and
so
i
think
your
honors
that
discuss
to
leave
the
law
as
is
and
if
they
want
to
substitute
the
collective-bargaining
remedy
for
the
statute,
i
think
the
place
to
do
that
is
in
the
congress
and
not
to
come
here
and
ask
your
honors
to
do
that
and
i
think
it's
solitary
that
we
have
both
remedies
so
that
the
seaman
can
choose
which
one
he
wants.
thank
you.
