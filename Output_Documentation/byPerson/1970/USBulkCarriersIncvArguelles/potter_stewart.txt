well,
can
you
envision
that
the
grievance
procedure
itself
if
it
found
that
--
this
overtime
was
due
and
that
--
and
further
held,
further
of
it
was
determined
that
they
were
withheld
“without
sufficient
cause”
that
the
grievance
procedure
itself
could
take
cognizance
of
the
statute
and
give
double
pay?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
the
only
reason
he
is
entitled
to
overtime,
extra
overtime
pay
all
it's
because
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice

what
if
the
six
months
period
ends
when
the
ship
is

a

is

generally

the

works
faster

doesn't
it?

certainly
it
