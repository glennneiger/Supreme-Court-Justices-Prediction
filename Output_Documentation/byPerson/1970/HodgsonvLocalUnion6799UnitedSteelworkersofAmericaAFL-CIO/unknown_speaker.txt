unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
straight
from
that
on
one
thing,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
if
there
is
no
complaint
filed,
the
secretary
has
no
investigatory
powers
under
section
402
(b)?
unknown
speaker
then
you’re
in
a
position
where
the
presence
of
a
complaint
is
your
starting
point
who
have
to
have
this?
unknown
speaker
and
having
the
complaint
and
your
argument
is
that
you
can
go
off
in
the
points
not
raise
in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
but
then
having
the
complaint
you
can’t
do
this
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
was
unjust?
unknown
speaker
does
the
member
--
does
a
member
have
the
right
to
present
the
secretary
anything
other
than
what
any
issues
that
he
had
not
exhausted
within
the
union?
unknown
speaker
but
a
member
--
but
it
would
think
the
secretary
need
to
exhaust
within
the
union
the
issue
of
the
president’s
election
and
then
he
files
for
secretary,
is
free
to
force
the
secretary
to
investigate
some
issues
he
didn’t
exhaust
on?
unknown
speaker
let’s
say
secretary
says
that
“i’m
not
interested
to
get
into
questions
exhausted
on
the
union”
and
the
fellow
says,
“i’m
sorry
but
i’ve
exhausted
on
one
issue
in
that.”
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
what
if
the
secretary
has
any
authority
to
say
that
he
--
well,
is
he
suppose
to
investigate
in
respondent’s
claim?
unknown
speaker
he’s
a
union
member
who
exhausted
on
one
issue.
they
go
to
secretary
and
says
here
are
six
issues
and
the
secretary
say
i
will
not
investigate
the
other
five.
unknown
speaker
he
cannot
say
that
because
the
member
has
no
right
to
trigger
his
--
unknown
speaker
all
five,
all
six
issues?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
just
take
this
case,
mr.
wallace.
the
member
comes
to
him
with
the
complaint
about
the
president’s
election
and
the
meeting
rules
when
he
hasn’t
exhausted
on
the
meeting
rules
on
the
union?
unknown
speaker
may
the
sectary
say,
“well,
it
sounds
like
a
clear
violation
but
i
am
just
not
investigating
that
because
you
did
not
exhaust
it
on
the
union.”
may
he
do
that?
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
really
saying
is
that
the
exhaustion
provision
in
the
context
of
the
statute
is
a
notice
provision?
unknown
speaker
if
on
the
statute
does
the
election
exhaustion
has?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
impression
i
got
from
the
brief
but
there’s
no
dispute
that
this
complaining
member
was
qualified
under
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
was
that
this
whole
issue?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
think
they
use
the
words
“a
violation?”
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
it
instead
of
“a”
it
were
that
“the
complaint
of”
violation?
unknown
speaker
you’re
suggesting
an
interpretation
that
is
as
if
instead
of
“a”
the
words
were
“the
complaint
of?”
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the
member
after
having
exhausted
on
one
issue
may
legally
under
the
act
file
a
complaint
with
the
secretary
listing
six
issues?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you’re
saying
if
he
files
like
a
complaint
listing
six
issues
when
it's
only
accept
exhausted
on
one,
the
secretary
really
has
no
authority
to
investigate
in
order
to
investigate
to
file
a
lawsuit
on
any
but
one.
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
that
member’s
additions
of
the
five
alleged
violations
brings
about
then
as
a
601
investigation?
unknown
speaker
and
can’t
be
read.
do
you
say
cannot
be
read
literally?
unknown
speaker
what
case
was
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
i
think
that’s
been
said
in
other
cases
generally
about
labor
legislation,
hasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
aren’t
worried
about
literal
reading,
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
it
would
be
there.
you
can
be
as
literal
as
an
exhaust
to
that?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
the
secretary’s
the
right
to
have
the
membership-attendance
rule
cast
on
in
a
suit,
in
this
case
only
when
he
sues
--
if
he
sues
just
for
the
set
aside
the
election
of
president?
what
about
the
--
unknown
speaker
unless
that
all
--
isn’t
that
a
section
for
him
to
carry
out
his
--
unknown
speaker
in
cases
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
if
the
membership
is
unhappy
about
one
--
about
thing
and
if
there
has
to
be
a
new
election
in
order
to
satisfy
the
membership
you’re
gong
to
have
to
carry
out
an
election
and
in
the
access
you
carry
out
of
election,
you
carry
out
one
that’s
in
accordance
with
the
law.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
know
how
you
can
say
that
if
congress
said
that
if
you
find
the
violation
carry
on
a
new
election
but
you
must
carry
it
out
in
accordance
with
law.
unknown
speaker
say
congress
didn’t
intend
for
him
to
raise
the
question
of
the
meeting-attendance
rule?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
understand
your
statement
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
get
it
right
that
you
in
this
regard
as
the
secretary
this
man
would
qualify
it
under
the
union
rule
and
it
made
no
complaint
to
the
secretary
putting
aside
exhaustion
about
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
that’s
an
overstatement
ever
heard
or
misunderstanding
or
what?
unknown
speaker
what
does
his
--
what
did
he
complained
about?
unknown
speaker
that’s
irrelevant
under
your
position
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
he
could
have
expressly
attack
the
rule
and
he
would
still
be
here?
unknown
speaker
in
the
same
market?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
if
we
reach
the
merits
should
this
court
pass
on
them
or
should
it
remand?
unknown
speaker
does
mr.
wallace
join
you
in
that?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
other
union
that
has
a
three-year?
unknown
speaker
i
think
and
suppose
it
was
made
as
this
and
here
is
a
man
who’s
qualified
under
the
rule
that
you’re
attacking
and
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
he
be
complaining
about
a
rule
himself
exactly?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
is
there
any
effort
by
anybody
since
the
other
cases
were
decided
this
issue
was
expressly
left
open,
of
course
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
any
efforts
made
to
get
congress
do
anything
about
it?
unknown
speaker
or
maybe
it
was
unnoticed
that
this
was
a
rather
close
question,
i
should
think?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
straight
from
that
on
one
thing,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
if
there
is
no
complaint
filed,
the

unknown
speaker
then
you’re
in
a
position
where
the
presence
of
a
complaint
is
your
starting
point
who
have
to
have
this?
unknown
speaker
and
having
the
complaint
and
your
argument
is
that
you
can
go
off
in
the

not

in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
but
then
having
the
complaint
you
can’t
do
this
at

unknown
speaker
and
was
unjust?
unknown
speaker
does
the
member
--
does
a
member
have
the
right
to
present
the
secretary
anything
other
than
what
any
issues
that
he
had
not

unknown
speaker
but
a

but
it

is

unknown

let’s

secretary
says
that
“i’m
not

to
get
into
questions
exhausted
on
the

and
the
fellow
says,
“i’m

i’ve
exhausted
on
one
issue
in
that.”
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
what
if
the
secretary
has
any
authority
to
say
that
he
--
well,
is
he
suppose
to
investigate
in
respondent’s

unknown
speaker
he’s
a
union
member
who
exhausted
on
one

they
go
to
secretary
and
says
here
are
six
issues
and
the
secretary
say
i
will
not
investigate
the
other
five.
unknown
speaker
he
cannot
say
that
because
the
member
has
no
right
to
trigger
his
--
unknown
speaker
all
five,
all
six
issues?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
just
take
this
case,
mr.
wallace.
the
member
comes
to
him
with
the
complaint
about
the
president’s
election
and
the
meeting
rules
when
he
hasn’t
exhausted
on
the
meeting
rules
on
the
union?
unknown
speaker
may
the
sectary
say,
“well,
it
sounds
like
a
clear
violation
but
i
am
just
not
investigating
that
because
you
did
not
exhaust
it
on
the
union.”
may
he
do
that?
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
really
saying
is
that
the
exhaustion
provision
in
the
context
of
the
statute
is
a
notice
provision?
unknown
speaker
if
on
the

does
the
election
exhaustion
has?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
impression
i
got
from
the
brief
but
there’s
no
dispute
that
this
complaining
member
was

unknown
speaker
was
that
this

unknown
speaker
why
did
you

unknown
speaker
you

if
it

it
were

you’re

that

unknown

and
can’t
be

do
you
say
cannot
be
read
literally?
unknown
speaker
what
case
was
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
i
think
that’s
been
said

generally

hasn’t

but
you

aren’t

unknown

well,
i
thought
it
would
be
there.
you
can
be
as
literal
as
an
exhaust
to
that?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
the
secretary’s
the
right
to
have
the
membership-attendance
rule
cast
on
in
a
suit,
in
this
case
only
when
he

you
find
the
violation
carry
on
a
