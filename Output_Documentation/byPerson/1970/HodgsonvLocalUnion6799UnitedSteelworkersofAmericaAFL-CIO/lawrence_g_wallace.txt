mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
brought
by
the
secretary
of
labor
under
title
iv
sometimes
called
the
union
democracy
provisions
of
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959.
it
was
brought
to
set
aside
the
1967
election
of
officers
of
the
respondent
local
union.
after
the
election
a
member
of
the
local
who
had
been
an
unsuccessful
candidate
for
president
protested
the
elections
conduct
to
the
union
and
after
relief
was
denied
filed
a
complaint
with
the
secretary.
his
internal
protest
with
the
union
had
complained
among
other
things
of
the
use
of
union
facilities
to
prepare
campaign
literature
for
the
incumbent
president
who
was
his
opponent
in
the
election.
his
complaint
with
the
secretary
repeated
this
charge
and
added
for
the
first
time
a
charge
that
an
unreasonably
restrictive
meeting-attendance
requirement
had
been
imposed
as
a
condition
for
candidacy.
after
investigating
the
election,
the
secretary
concluded
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
act
had
been
violated
with
respect
to
each
of
these
matters
and
he
advised
the
respondent
unions
of
these
findings
and
invited
them
to
discuss
the
findings
and
to
take
internal
remedial
action.
when
after
discussions
the
respondent
unions
refused
to
undertake
remedial
measures
and
either
of
these
matters,
the
suit
was
filed.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
secretary’s
complaint
with
respect
to
the
use
of
union
facilities
to
promote
the
candidacy
of
the
incumbent
president.
the
election
for
that
office
was
accordingly
ordered
set
aside
on
that
ground
and
that
aspect
of
the
judgment
below
is
not
at
issue
in
this
court.
what
is
at
issue
are
the
rulings
of
the
courts
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
meeting-attendance
requirement.
the
district
court
held
that
the
secretary
did
have
authority
or
standing
to
raise
that
issue
in
this
litigation
even
though
it
had
not
been
a
subject
of
the
member’s
complaint
with
the
union
but
the
district
court
upheld
the
meeting-attendance
requirement
on
the
merits
as
authorized
by
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
but
on
the
ground
that
the
secretary
did
not
have
standing
to
raise
this
issue
and
the
suit,
did
not
reach
the
merits.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
we
asked
this
court
to
decide
the
standing
issue
and
if
it
decided
the
standing
issue
in
our
favor
also
to
go
on
and
reach
the
issue
on
the
merits
since
it
is
an
issue
of
national
importance
involved
in
litigation
against
several
locals
of
the
steelworkers
union
around
the
country
and
the
respondents
have
joined
in
urging
that
both
issues
be
reach
if
the
standing
issue
is
indeed
resolved
in
our
favor.
now
if
the
court
please,
i
plan
first
to
discuss
the
standing
issue
and
that
in
the
course
of
discussing
the
second
issue
to
summarize
the
facts
that
relate
to
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
meeting-attendance
requirement.
the
provisions
of
the
statute
relevant
to
the
standing
issue
can
be
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
pages
28
and
29
of
the
brief
in
section
402
of
the
act
and
i
wish
first
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
section
402
(b)
on
page
28.
and
there
the
governing
statutory
language
is
that
after
a
member
of
the
organization
has
filed
the
complaint,
the
secretary
shall
investigate
such
complaint
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
of
this
title
has
occurred
and
his
not
been
remedied
he
shall
within
a
certain
time
bring
the
suit.
now,
as
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief
the
statutory
language
is
consistent
with
our
position
that
the
secretary
has
authority
indeed
it
supports
our
position
of
the
secretary
has
authority
to
raise
in
the
lawsuit
any
violation
which
his
investigation
discloses
to
have
occurred
in
the
election
concerning
which
the
complaint
has
been
filed.
and
we
noted
also
that
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history,
congress
had
before
it
a
drafted
an
alternative
bill
which
would
have
limited
the
lawsuit
to
the
particular
allegation
made
in
the
complaint
and
while
there’s
no
explicit
reason
given
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
for
the
choice
of
this
language
rather
than
the
alternative
language
we
think
there
is
significance
in
the
fact
that
this
broader
formulation
was
chosen
by
congress.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
does
have
investigatory
powers
but
he
would
not
have
powers
to
bring
any
lawsuit.
he
will
have
powers
only
to
advice
the
union
if
he
believes
that
the
unions
procedures
were
not
in
accordance
with
the
act
but
those
powers
are
conferred
under
another
section
of
the
act
which
is
not
reproduced
in
our
appendix,
section
601.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
section
402
in
order
for
the
secretary
to
have
authority
to
bring
this
lawsuit
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
can
investigate
and
inform
the
union
but
cannot
bring
a
lawsuit
in
the
absence
of
a
complaint,
that
is
our
argument
and
i’ll
elaborate
on
the
reasons
for
it
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
without
exhaustion
by
the
union
member
although
in
practice
the
secretary
always
gives
the
union
an
opportunity
to
remedy
the
violations
he
has
found
internally.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
certainly
does
mr.
justice
harlan
and
this
lawsuit
never
could
have
been
brought
by
the
secretary
if
the
complaint
had
been
rectified
internally
by
the
union
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
complaining
member.
we
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
presumably
never
would
have
gone
to
the
secretary
if
the
union
had
redressed
to
specific
violation
which
he
complained.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
601,
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
except
unlike
the
union
member
he
does
not
have
ultimate
redress
to
anyone
who
can
then
bring
a
lawsuit,
[laughter]
if
the
negotiations
are
unsuccessful.
now,
before
we
leave
the
face
of
the
statute
we
think
there
is
another
provision
in
section
402
which
has
great
bearing
on
this
question
and
that
is
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
subsection
c-2.
and
that
indicates
that
if
the
secretary
suit
is
successful
the
court
shall
set
aside
the
election
declare
the
election
if
any
to
be
avoid
and
direct
the
conduct
of
a
new
election
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
and
so
far
as
lawful
impracticable
inconformity
with
the
constitution
and
by-laws
of
the
labor
organization.
this
raises
a
considerable
problem
if
the
scope
of
the
lawsuit
brought
by
the
secretary
is
to
be
limited
only
to
the
complaint
raise
by
the
union
member
because
the
secretary
is
charge
if
he
is
successful
in
that
lawsuit
with
supervising
a
new
election
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and
by
laws
in
so
far
as
they
are
lawful
and
in
this
instance
the
secretary
was
of
the
view
with
that
at
the
meeting-attendance
requirement
as
a
condition
of
candidacy
was
not
lawful
as
alternative
if
he
could
not
raise
that
issue
in
the
litigation
would
be
there
to
supervise
the
election
applying
what
he
believe
to
be
a
candidacy
qualification
violative
of
the
act
or
to
delay
the
election
while
this
issue
is
separately
litigated
before
the
new
election
is
conducted
which
we
think
would
be
inconsistent
with
congress’
purpose
to
expedite
the
provision
of
relief
under
this
statute.
once
the
district
court
has
in
fact
found
the
violation
of
the
statute
provides
that
there
can
be
no
stay
of
the
district
court
judgment
setting
aside
the
election
and
ordering
a
new
one
while
that
judgment
is
appeal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
the
possibility
of
this
intermediate
position
that
only
that
particular
election
would
then
be
conducted
in
conformity
with
the
law
as
the
secretary
views
the
law
and
as
the
courts
presumably
would
have
uphold
it.
but
this
would
have
the
disadvantage
that
admittedly
the
other
officers
would
have
been
elected
unlawfully
under
that
very
decision
and
yet
their
election
would
stand
which
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
once
his
intervention
is
warrant
under
the
statute
then
it
seems
to
us
on
a
proper
reading
of
the
legislative
history
and
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
statute
that
the
scope
of
the
redress
is
not
to
be
limited
by
what
may
have
been
the
limited
perception
of
the
individual
complain
into
what
was
wrong
with
the
election
or
by
his
own
self
interest.
there
is
a
broader
public
interest
to
be
serve
by
the
secretary’s
intervention
once
its
warranted
and
as
the
court
put
the
matter
in
the
glass
bottle
blowers
case
in
389
u.s.
although
congress
was
committed
to
minimal
intervention
it
was
obviously
equally
committed
to
making
that
intervention
once
warranted
effective
in
carrying
out
the
basic
aim
of
title
iv
which
is
to
assure
free
and
democratic
union
elections.
perhaps
the
most
significant
thing
about
the
legislative
history
of
title
iv
is
that
congress
chose
to
invest
the
enforcement
authority
in
the
secretary
rather
than
in
the
individual
complainant.
at
one
time
a
bill
was
passed
in
the
house
which
would
have
made
the
rights
enforceable
by
private
suit.
but
as
finally
enacted
the
law
recognizes
that
there
is
a
broader
public
interest
to
be
served
and
not
merely
they
redress
of
individual
grievances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
other
matters
that
can
be
challenge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
need
not
go
that
far
mr.
chief
justice.
that’s
perhaps
the
more
difficult
case.
here
at
that
challenge
about
the
secretary
is
limited
to
the
1967
election.
all
of
these
officers
were
elected
in
the
same
1967
election.
the
validity
of
which
have
been
questioned
and
it’s
been
questioned
by
the
secretary
on
the
ground
that
an
unlawful
meeting-attendance
requirement
was
impose
as
a
condition
for
the
candidacy
qualification
and
this
applied
to
all
the
candidates
elected
in
that
election.
and
title
iv
does
not
limit
the
investigation
after
unlawful
use
of
the
union
funds.
there
need
to
be
a
complaint
before
the
secretary
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
act
to
do
something
about
union
funds.
so,
this
--
really
this
argument
relates
to
the
setting
aside
of
elections
and
the
holding
of
new
supervise
elections.
now,
there
was
the
subsidiary
purpose
of
fostering
unions
self-government
in
the
act.
we
recognized
that.
it
wasn’t
the
dominant
purpose.
we
recognized
that
if
everyone
is
satisfied
the
election
cannot
be
disturb
or
if
everyone
can
be
made
satisfied
through
internal
procedures
the
election
cannot
be
disturb.
but
as
we
elaborate
in
our
brief
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
read
broader
implications
than
this
into
the
exhaustion
requirement
that
is
the
requirement
that
the
member
exhaust
union
remedies
because
this
is
very
different
from
the
normal
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
situation.
the
congress
has
not
conferred
a
factfinding
or
any
other
kind
of
governmental
authority
on
the
union
on
these
private
organizations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
will
entertain
complains
but
even
if
the
complain
and
then
in
this
case
had
not
raise
the
question
of
the
candidacy
qualification,
the
secretary
would
embrace
that
within
his
investigation
and
this
court
and
others
have
indicated
his
investigatory
powers
broad
and
if
he
concluded
that
there
was
a
violation
he
would
include
that
in
the
allegations
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
views
his
own
responsibility
as
investigating
the
entire
validity
of
the
election
so
that
the
members
enforcing
the
secretary
whether
he
alleges
the
additional
one
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
need
not
bring
the
suit.
under
section
601
the
secretary
can
investigate
any
matter
at
anyone’s
complain
at
any
time
or
without
a
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
certainly!
i
hate
to
get
that
he
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
can
but
if
that
has
not
been
the
secretary’s
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
to
investigate
the
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
the
secretary
believes
that
they
would
not
state
probable
cause
to
believe
the
act
was
violated
then
there
is
nothing
that
he
need
investigate
with
respect
to
some
of
the
issues
raise.
there
is
no
point
in
investigating
something
which
on
it
is
face
doesn’t
raise
an
issue
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
suppose
he
may
he
never
has
and
that
issue
has
never
arisen
and
it’s
hard
for
me
to
concede
that
the
secretary
would
do
that,
i
mean
his
responsibility
is
to
try
redress
violations
at
least
through
conciliatory
means.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
could
mr.
justice
under
our
view
of
the
statute.
now,
i
believe
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
secretary
does
invariably
afford
an
opportunity
for
the
union
to
remedy
anything
that
he
deems
a
violation
before
he
sues
as
he
did
here.
the
union
had
the
same
opportunity
that
would
have
had
if
the
member
had
presented
that
specific
complaint
along
with
his
other
complaints,
the
same
opportunity
to
redress
that
internally.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
the
statute
does
not
say
exhaustion
of
each
point,
the
statute
says
a
member
who
has
exhausted
his
remedy,
his
internal
remedy
can
file
a
complaint
with
the
secretary
and
then
the
secretary
after
his
investigation
if
he
finds
probable
cause,
he
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred,
they
bring
a
lawsuit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
violation,
it
doesn’t
say
the
violation
alleged
or
exhausted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
any
violation
surely
that
“a”
means
more
than
one
if
two
violations
were
alleges
initially.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
secretary
can
bring
a
lawsuit
because
there
has
been
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
member
of
the
local
with
this
election
and
the
secretary
upon
investigating
it
found
that
there
was
indeed
reason
to
believe
that
the
statute
was
violated.
it
may
be
that
the
disaffected
union
member
did
not
perceive
the
accurate
basis
on
which
there
was
a
violation
in
that
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
only
thing
required.
now
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
secretary
does
not
bring
a
lawsuit
in
a
situation
where
the
complaint
itself
was
in
his
view
completely
without
merit.
but
under
our
view
of
the
statute
he
has
the
authority
to
do
this
as
we
point
our
in
our
brief
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
read
too
much
into
this
exhaustion
requirement
so
long
as
internal
rectification
opportunity
for
internal
rectification
is
afforded
to
the
union.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
it
is
not
a
situation
comparable
to
exhaustion
of
remedies
in
a
governmental
agency.
when
the
suit
is
in
fact
brought
it’s
completely
de
novo.
it’s
not
suit
to
review
the
union’s
determination
and
it’s
not
a
suit
limited
to
the
record
that
was
made
before
the
union.
it’s
not
a
classical
case
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
a
familiar
word
but
given
the
entire
purpose
of
the
statute
the
dominant
purpose
of
congress
was
to
assure
free
and
democratic
union
elections
and
there
was
a
subsidiary
purpose
here
which
we
believe
the
secretary
honors
in
his
practices
of
permitting
union
self-government
and
not
intervening
if
everyone
in
the
local
is
satisfied
with
the
result.
all
of
these
purposes
are
served
by
the
approach
that
the
secretary
takes
but
the
dominant
purpose
would
be
this
serve
by
the
view
that
the
secretary
cannot
assure
the
free
and
democratic
election
under
the
statute
as
the
statute
requires
it
because
of
shortcomings
in
the
initial
complaint
when
in
fact
the
secretary
has
given
the
union
the
opportunity
to
rectify
those
shortcomings.
it
comes
down
to
almost
the
technicality
as
to
from
whom
the
union
heard
about
the
shortcomings
(voice
overlap)
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
well,
there
is
another
issue
in
this
case
and
my
time
for
discussing
it
is
quite
limited
but
we
believe
it
is
a
very
important
issue
and
it
is
an
issue
under
section
401
of
the
act
which
is
on
page
27
of
our
brief
whether
this
requirement
was
impose
is
a
requirement
authorized
by
the
act
is
a
reasonable
qualification
uniformly
imposed.
we
believe
that
it
wasn’t
under
the
approach
taken
by
this
court
in
the
hotel
workers
case
in
391
u.s.
which
elaborate
at
some
length
the
narrowness
of
the
statutory
exception
and
the
fact
that
congress
took
as
its
model
democratic
elections
in
which
a
requirement
of
this
sort
which
it
just
qualified
the
majority
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
of
a
possible
candidates
would
be
unthinkable
and
an
ordinary
political
election
this
kind
of
a
question
is
a
campaign
issue
rather
than
a
basis
for
disqualification.
and
if
i
may,
i’ll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondents
reading
of
the
statute
seems
to
us
perhaps
to
be
appropriate
one
if
the
house
version
had
been
enacted
giving
the
complainant
the
right
to
sue
but
it
seems.
we
believe
the
most
crucial
decision
in
the
legislative
history
was
when
congress
decide
instead
to
bring
the
secretary
into
the
picture.
under
the
respondents
reading
of
this,
the
only
possible
effect
of
bringing
the
secretary
into
the
picture
is
that
he
may
decide
not
to
sue
about
something
that
the
complainant
would
have
sued
about
he
cannot
expand
the
scope
of
the
lawsuit.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
brought
the
secretary
into
the
picture
for
exactly
the
opposite
reason
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
beyond
the
limited
self-interest
of
the
complainant,
to
look
at
the
broader
public
purposes
that
involve
in
this
statute
in
order
to
assure
free
and
democratic
elections
for
everyone.
now,
even
look
at
narrowly
it's
true
that
this
complainant
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
qualified
himself
but
it
was
a
close
election
for
president
and
the
result
might
well
have
been
different
if
someone
else
have
been
able
to
run
in
addition,
it
might
have
taken
away
more
votes
from
his
opponent
than
from
himself,
as
it
happens
in
national
elections.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
district
courts
reading
of
his
complaint
on
page
44
of
the
records
said
that
this
what
he
complained
about
of
the
secretary.
we
think
that
was
inaccurate
reading
and
it
may
have
been
because
he
felt
that
with
more
candidates
in
the
field
he
would
have
done
better.
there
are
people
who
are
helping
that
and
one
of
the
governors
will
run
for
president
on
third
party
ticket
this
year
because
they
think
they
will
benefit
from
it.
but
self-interest
is
not
what
congress
wanted
to
promote
under
this
statute
and
indeed
in
a
very
real
sense
since
the
secretary’s
policy
is
to
sue
only
if
in
his
view
the
members’
complain
to
the
union
had
validity
in
a
very
real
sense,
what
we
are
asking
for
here
is
to
enable
the
secretary
to
consolidate
the
lawsuits
that
otherwise
would
have
to
be
separately
brought
first
to
determine
whether
the
election
would
be
set
aside
and
then
to
determine
under
what
rules
the
new
election
would
be
held
which
would
it
seems
to
us
intolerably
delay
the
prompt
remedy
that
congress
wanted
to
provide.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
issue
was
open.
that
is
correct
but
congress
has
not
acted
and
there
has
not
been
an
effort.
there
have
been
attempts
to
clarify
the
issue
in
the
courts.
now,
i
do
want
to
point
out
before
i
sit
down
since
a
reference
has
been
to
the
secretary’s
interpretive
manual
which
is
on
page
203
of
the
appendix
and
it
does
say
that
12
of
--
that
in
an
attendance
requirement
for
12
of
24
may
be
reasonable.
this
is
not
a
regulation.
it
was
not
published
in
the
federal
register.
it
was
prepared
for
internal
purposes
as
a
guide
to
fieldworkers
in
the
department
and
was
made
public
only
by
virtue
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
it
was
not
designed
to
be
definitive
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
certainly
the
respondents
have
not
relied
on
that
provision
because
neither
in
that
provision
or
in
anything
else
as
the
secretary
ever
said
that
a
three-year
requirement
may
be
reasonable
and
it's
a
three-year
requirement
that’s
involved
here
and
is
necessary
implicated
in
the
case
on
the
rerun
of
the
election
even
though
the
violations
alleged
was
a
violation
for
the
application
to
21
months
to
three-year
requirement
is
what
is
to
be
applied
on
the
rerun.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
brought
by
the
secretary
of
labor
under
title
iv
sometimes
called
the
union
democracy
provisions
of
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959.
it
was
brought
to
set
aside
the
1967
election
of
officers
of
the
respondent
local
union.
after
the
election
a
member
of
the
local
who
had
been
an
unsuccessful
candidate
for
president
protested
the
elections
conduct
to
the
union
and
after
relief
was
denied
filed
a
complaint
with
the
secretary.
his
internal
protest
with
the
union
had
complained
among
other
things
of
the
use
of
union
facilities
to
prepare
campaign
literature
for
the
incumbent
president
who
was
his
opponent
in
the
election.
his
complaint
with
the
secretary
repeated
this
charge
and
added
for
the
first
time
a
charge
that
an
unreasonably
restrictive
meeting-attendance
requirement
had
been
imposed
as
a
condition
for
candidacy.
after
investigating
the
election,
the
secretary
concluded
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
act
had
been
violated
with
respect
to
each
of
these
matters
and
he
advised
the
respondent
unions
of
these
findings
and
invited
them
to
discuss
the
findings
and
to
take
internal
remedial
action.
when
after
discussions
the
respondent
unions
refused
to
undertake
remedial
measures
and
either
of
these
matters,
the
suit
was
filed.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
secretary’s
complaint
with
respect
to
the
use
of
union
facilities
to
promote
the
candidacy
of
the
incumbent
president.
the
election
for
that
office
was
accordingly
ordered
set
aside
on
that
ground
and
that
aspect
of
the
judgment
below
is
not
at
issue
in
this
court.
what
is
at
issue
are
the
rulings
of
the
courts
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
meeting-attendance
requirement.
the
district
court
held
that
the
secretary
did
have
authority
or
standing
to
raise
that
issue
in
this
litigation
even
though
it
had
not
been
a
subject
of
the
member’s
complaint
with
the
union
but
the
district
court
upheld
the
meeting-attendance
requirement
on
the
merits
as
authorized
by
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
but
on
the
ground
that
the
secretary
did
not
have
standing
to
raise
this
issue
and
the
suit,
did
not
reach
the
merits.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
we
asked
this
court
to
decide
the
standing
issue
and
if
it
decided
the
standing
issue
in
our
favor
also
to
go
on
and
reach
the
issue
on
the
merits
since
it
is
an
issue
of
national
importance
involved
in
litigation
against
several
locals
of
the
steelworkers
union
around
the
country
and
the
respondents
have
joined
in
urging
that
both
issues
be
reach
if
the
standing
issue
is
indeed
resolved
in
our
favor.
now
if
the
court
please,
i
plan
first
to
discuss
the
standing
issue
and
that
in
the
course
of
discussing
the
second
issue
to
summarize
the
facts
that
relate
to
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
meeting-attendance
requirement.
the
provisions
of
the
statute
relevant
to
the
standing
issue
can
be
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
pages
28
and
29
of
the
brief
in
section
402
of
the
act
and
i
wish
first
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
section
402
(b)
on
page
28.
and
there
the
governing
statutory
language
is
that
after
a
member
of
the
organization
has
filed
the
complaint,
the
secretary
shall
investigate
such
complaint
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
of
this
title
has
occurred
and
his
not
been
remedied
he
shall
within
a
certain
time
bring
the
suit.
now,
as
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief
the
statutory
language
is
consistent
with
our
position
that
the
secretary
has
authority
indeed
it
supports
our
position
of
the
secretary
has
authority
to
raise
in
the
lawsuit
any
violation
which
his
investigation
discloses
to
have
occurred
in
the
election
concerning
which
the
complaint
has
been
filed.
and
we
noted
also
that
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history,
congress
had
before
it
a
drafted
an
alternative
bill
which
would
have
limited
the
lawsuit
to
the
particular
allegation
made
in
the
complaint
and
while
there’s
no
explicit
reason
given
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
for
the
choice
of
this
language
rather
than
the
alternative
language
we
think
there
is
significance
in
the
fact
that
this
broader
formulation
was
chosen
by
congress.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
does
have
investigatory
powers
but
he
would
not
have
powers
to
bring
any
lawsuit.
he
will
have
powers
only
to
advice
the
union
if
he
believes
that
the
unions
procedures
were
not
in
accordance
with
the
act
but
those
powers
are
conferred
under
another
section
of
the
act
which
is
not
reproduced
in
our
appendix,
section
601.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
section
402
in
order
for
the
secretary
to
have
authority
to
bring
this
lawsuit
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
can
investigate
and
inform
the
union
but
cannot
bring
a
lawsuit
in
the
absence
of
a
complaint,
that
is
our
argument
and
i’ll
elaborate
on
the
reasons
for
it
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
without
exhaustion
by
the
union
member
although
in
practice
the
secretary
always
gives
the
union
an
opportunity
to
remedy
the
violations
he
has
found
internally.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
certainly
does
mr.
justice
harlan
and
this
lawsuit
never
could
have
been
brought
by
the
secretary
if
the
complaint
had
been
rectified
internally
by
the
union
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
complaining
member.
we
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
presumably
never
would
have
gone
to
the
secretary
if
the
union
had
redressed
to
specific
violation
which
he
complained.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
601,
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
except
unlike
the
union
member
he
does
not
have
ultimate
redress
to
anyone
who
can
then
bring
a
lawsuit,
[laughter]
if
the
negotiations
are
unsuccessful.
now,
before
we
leave
the
face
of
the
statute
we
think
there
is
another
provision
in
section
402
which
has
great
bearing
on
this
question
and
that
is
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
subsection
c-2.
and
that
indicates
that
if
the
secretary
suit
is
successful
the
court
shall
set
aside
the
election
declare
the
election
if
any
to
be
avoid
and
direct
the
conduct
of
a
new
election
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
and
so
far
as
lawful
impracticable
inconformity
with
the
constitution
and
by-laws
of
the
labor
organization.
this
raises
a
considerable
problem
if
the
scope
of
the
lawsuit
brought
by
the
secretary
is
to
be
limited
only
to
the
complaint
raise
by
the
union
member
because
the
secretary
is
charge
if
he
is
successful
in
that
lawsuit
with
supervising
a
new
election
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and
by
laws
in
so
far
as
they
are
lawful
and
in
this
instance
the
secretary
was
of
the
view
with
that
at
the
meeting-attendance
requirement
as
a
condition
of
candidacy
was
not
lawful
as
alternative
if
he
could
not
raise
that
issue
in
the
litigation
would
be
there
to
supervise
the
election
applying
what
he
believe
to
be
a
candidacy
qualification
violative
of
the
act
or
to
delay
the
election
while
this
issue
is
separately
litigated
before
the
new
election
is
conducted
which
we
think
would
be
inconsistent
with
congress’
purpose
to
expedite
the
provision
of
relief
under
this
statute.
once
the
district
court
has
in
fact
found
the
violation
of
the
statute
provides
that
there
can
be
no
stay
of
the
district
court
judgment
setting
aside
the
election
and
ordering
a
new
one
while
that
judgment
is
appeal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
the
possibility
of
this
intermediate
position
that
only
that
particular
election
would
then
be
conducted
in
conformity
with
the
law
as
the
secretary
views
the
law
and
as
the
courts
presumably
would
have
uphold
it.
but
this
would
have
the
disadvantage
that
admittedly
the
other
officers
would
have
been
elected
unlawfully
under
that
very
decision
and
yet
their
election
would
stand
which
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
once
his
intervention
is
warrant
under
the
statute
then
it
seems
to
us
on
a
proper
reading
of
the
legislative
history
and
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
statute
that
the
scope
of
the
redress
is
not
to
be
limited
by
what
may
have
been
the
limited
perception
of
the
individual
complain
into
what
was
wrong
with
the
election
or
by
his
own
self
interest.
there
is
a
broader
public
interest
to
be
serve
by
the
secretary’s
intervention
once
its
warranted
and
as
the
court
put
the
matter
in
the
glass
bottle
blowers
case
in
389
u.s.
although
congress
was
committed
to
minimal
intervention
it
was
obviously
equally
committed
to
making
that
intervention
once
warranted
effective
in
carrying
out
the
basic
aim
of
title
iv
which
is
to
assure
free
and
democratic
union
elections.
perhaps
the
most
significant
thing
about
the
legislative
history
of
title
iv
is
that
congress
chose
to
invest
the
enforcement
authority
in
the
secretary
rather
than
in
the
individual
complainant.
at
one
time
a
bill
was
passed
in
the
house
which
would
have
made
the
rights
enforceable
by
private
suit.
but
as
finally
enacted
the
law
recognizes
that
there
is
a
broader
public
interest
to
be
served
and
not
merely
they
redress
of
individual
grievances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
other
matters
that
can
be
challenge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
need
not
go
that
far
mr.
chief
justice.
that’s
perhaps
the
more
difficult
case.
here
at
that
challenge
about
the
secretary
is
limited
to
the
1967
election.
all
of
these
officers
were
elected
in
the
same
1967
election.
the
validity
of
which
have
been
questioned
and
it’s
been
questioned
by
the
secretary
on
the
ground
that
an
unlawful
meeting-attendance
requirement
was
impose
as
a
condition
for
the
candidacy
qualification
and
this
applied
to
all
the
candidates
elected
in
that
election.
and
title
iv
does
not
limit
the
investigation
after
unlawful
use
of
the
union
funds.
there
need
to
be
a
complaint
before
the
secretary
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
act
to
do
something
about
union
funds.
so,
this
--
really
this
argument
relates
to
the
setting
aside
of
elections
and
the
holding
of
new
supervise
elections.
now,
there
was
the
subsidiary
purpose
of
fostering
unions
self-government
in
the
act.
we
recognized
that.
it
wasn’t
the
dominant
purpose.
we
recognized
that
if
everyone
is
satisfied
the
election
cannot
be
disturb
or
if
everyone
can
be
made
satisfied
through
internal
procedures
the
election
cannot
be
disturb.
but
as
we
elaborate
in
our
brief
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
read
broader
implications
than
this
into
the
exhaustion
requirement
that
is
the
requirement
that
the
member
exhaust
union
remedies
because
this
is
very
different
from
the
normal
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
situation.
the
congress
has
not
conferred
a
factfinding
or
any
other
kind
of
governmental
authority
on
the
union
on
these
private
organizations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
will
entertain
complains
but
even
if
the
complain
and
then
in
this
case
had
not
raise
the
question
of
the
candidacy
qualification,
the
secretary
would
embrace
that
within
his
investigation
and
this
court
and
others
have
indicated
his
investigatory
powers
broad
and
if
he
concluded
that
there
was
a
violation
he
would
include
that
in
the
allegations
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
views
his
own
responsibility
as
investigating
the
entire
validity
of
the
election
so
that
the
members
enforcing
the
secretary
whether
he
alleges
the
additional
one
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
need
not
bring
the
suit.
under
section
601
the
secretary
can
investigate
any
matter
at
anyone’s
complain
at
any
time
or
without
a
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
certainly!
i
hate
to
get
that
he
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
secretary
can
but
if
that
has
not
been
the
secretary’s
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
to
investigate
the
complaint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
the
secretary
believes
that
they
would
not
state
probable
cause
to
believe
the
act
was
violated
then
there
is
nothing
that
he
need
investigate
with
respect
to
some
of
the
issues
raise.
there
is
no
point
in
investigating
something
which
on
it
is
face
doesn’t
raise
an
issue
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
suppose
he
may
he
never
has
and
that
issue
has
never
arisen
and
it’s
hard
for
me
to
concede
that
the
secretary
would
do
that,
i
mean
his
responsibility
is
to
try
redress
violations
at
least
through
conciliatory
means.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
could
mr.
justice
under
our
view
of
the
statute.
now,
i
believe
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
secretary
does
invariably
afford
an
opportunity
for
the
union
to
remedy
anything
that
he
deems
a
violation
before
he
sues
as
he
did
here.
the
union
had
the
same
opportunity
that
would
have
had
if
the
member
had
presented
that
specific
complaint
along
with
his
other
complaints,
the
same
opportunity
to
redress
that
internally.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
the
statute
does
not
say
exhaustion
of
each
point,
the
statute
says
a
member
who
has
exhausted
his
remedy,
his
internal
remedy
can
file
a
complaint
with
the
secretary
and
then
the
secretary
after
his
investigation
if
he
finds
probable
cause,
he
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred,
they
bring
a
lawsuit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
violation,
it
doesn’t
say
the
violation
alleged
or
exhausted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
any
violation
surely
that
“a”
means
more
than
one
if
two
violations
were
alleges
initially.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
secretary
can
bring
a
lawsuit
because
there
has
been
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
member
of
the
local
with
this
election
and
the
secretary
upon
investigating
it
found
that
there
was
indeed
reason
to
believe
that
the
statute
was
violated.
it
may
be
that
the
disaffected
union
member
did
not
perceive
the
accurate
basis
on
which
there
was
a
violation
in
that
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
only
thing
required.
now
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
secretary
does
not
bring
a
lawsuit
in
a
situation
where
the
complaint
itself
was
in
his
view
completely
without
merit.
but
under
our
view
of
the
statute
he
has
the
authority
to
do
this
as
we
point
our
in
our
brief
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
read
too
much
into
this
exhaustion
requirement
so
long
as
internal
rectification
opportunity
for
internal
rectification
is
afforded
to
the
union.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
it
is
not
a
situation
comparable
to
exhaustion
of
remedies
in
a
governmental
agency.
when
the
suit
is
in
fact
brought
it’s
completely
de
novo.
it’s
not
suit
to
review
the
union’s
determination
and
it’s
not
a
suit
limited
to
the
record
that
was
made
before
the
union.
it’s
not
a
classical
case
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
a
familiar
word
but
given
the
entire
purpose
of
the
statute
the
dominant
purpose
of
congress
was
to
assure
free
and
democratic
union
elections
and
there
was
a
subsidiary
purpose
here
which
we
believe
the
secretary
honors
in
his
practices
of
permitting
union
self-government
and
not
intervening
if
everyone
in
the
local
is
satisfied
with
the
result.
all
of
these
purposes
are
served
by
the
approach
that
the
secretary
takes
but
the
dominant
purpose
would
be
this
serve
by
the
view
that
the
secretary
cannot
assure
the
free
and
democratic
election
under
the
statute
as
the
statute
requires
it
because
of
shortcomings
in
the
initial
complaint
when
in
fact
the
secretary
has
given
the
union
the
opportunity
to
rectify
those
shortcomings.
it
comes
down
to
almost
the
technicality
as
to
from
whom
the
union
heard
about
the
shortcomings
(voice
overlap)
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
well,
there
is
another
issue
in
this
case
and
my
time
for
discussing
it
is
quite
limited
but
we
believe
it
is
a
very
important
issue
and
it
is
an
issue
under
section
401
of
the
act
which
is
on
page
27
of
our
brief
whether
this
requirement
was
impose
is
a
requirement
authorized
by
the
act
is
a
reasonable
qualification
uniformly
imposed.
we
believe
that
it
wasn’t
under
the
approach
taken
by
this
court
in
the
hotel
workers
case
in
391
u.s.
which
elaborate
at
some
length
the
narrowness
of
the
statutory
exception
and
the
fact
that
congress
took
as
its
model
democratic
elections
in
which
a
requirement
of
this
sort
which
it
just
qualified
the
majority
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
of
a
possible
candidates
would
be
unthinkable
and
an
ordinary
political
election
this
kind
of
a
question
is
a
campaign
issue
rather
than
a
basis
for
disqualification.
and
if
i
may,
i’ll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondents
reading
of
the
statute
seems
to
us
perhaps
to
be
appropriate
one
if
the
house
version
had
been
enacted
giving
the
complainant
the
right
to
sue
but
it
seems.
we
believe
the
most
crucial
decision
in
the
legislative
history
was
when
congress
decide
instead
to
bring
the
secretary
into
the
picture.
under
the
respondents
reading
of
this,
the
only
possible
effect
of
bringing
the
secretary
into
the
picture
is
that
he
may
decide
not
to
sue
about
something
that
the
complainant
would
have
sued
about
he
cannot
expand
the
scope
of
the
lawsuit.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
brought
the
secretary
into
the
picture
for
exactly
the
opposite
reason
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
beyond
the
limited
self-interest
of
the
complainant,
to
look
at
the
broader
public
purposes
that
involve
in
this
statute
in
order
to
assure
free
and
democratic
elections
for
everyone.
now,
even
look
at
narrowly
it's
true
that
this
complainant
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
qualified
himself
but
it
was
a
close
election
for
president
and
the
result
might
well
have
been
different
if
someone
else
have
been
able
to
run
in
addition,
it
might
have
taken
away
more
votes
from
his
opponent
than
from
himself,
as
it
happens
in
national
elections.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
district
courts
reading
of
his
complaint
on
page
44
of
the
records
said
that
this
what
he
complained
about
of
the
secretary.
we
think
that
was
inaccurate
reading
and
it
may
have
been
because
he
felt
that
with
more
candidates
in
the
field
he
would
have
done
better.
there
are
people
who
are
helping
that
and
one
of
the
governors
will
run
for
president
on
third
party
ticket
this
year
because
they
think
they
will
benefit
from
it.
but
self-interest
is
not
what
congress
wanted
to
promote
under
this
statute
and
indeed
in
a
very
real
sense
since
the
secretary’s
policy
is
to
sue
only
if
in
his
view
the
members’
complain
to
the
union
had
validity
in
a
very
real
sense,
what
we
are
asking
for
here
is
to
enable
the
secretary
to
consolidate
the
lawsuits
that
otherwise
would
have
to
be
separately
brought
first
to
determine
whether
the
election
would
be
set
aside
and
then
to
determine
under
what
rules
the
new
election
would
be
held
which
would
it
seems
to
us
intolerably
delay
the
prompt
remedy
that
congress
wanted
to
provide.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
issue
was
open.
that
is
correct
but
congress
has
not
acted
and
there
has
not
been
an
effort.
there
have
been
attempts
to
clarify
the
issue
in
the
courts.
now,
i
do
want
to
point
out
before
i
sit
down
since
a
reference
has
been
to
the
secretary’s
interpretive
manual
which
is
on
page
203
of
the
appendix
and
it
does
say
that
12
of
--
that
in
an
attendance
requirement
for
12
of
24
may
be
reasonable.
this
is
not
a
regulation.
it
was
not
published
in
the
federal
register.
it
was
prepared
for
internal
purposes
as
a
guide
to
fieldworkers
in
the
department
and
was
made
public
only
by
virtue
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
it
was
not
designed
to
be
definitive
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
certainly
the
respondents
have
not
relied
on
that
provision
because
neither
in
that
provision
or
in
anything
else
as
the
secretary
ever
said
that
a
three-year
requirement
may
be
reasonable
and
it's
a
three-year
requirement
that’s
involved
here
and
is
necessary
implicated
in
the
case
on
the
rerun
of
the
election
even
though
the
violations
alleged
was
a
violation
for
the
application
to
21
months
to
three-year
requirement
is
what
is
to
be
applied
on
the
rerun.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
