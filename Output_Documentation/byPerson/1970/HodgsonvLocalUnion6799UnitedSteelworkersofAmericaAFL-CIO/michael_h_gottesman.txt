mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
the
principal
thrust
of
mr.
wallace’s
argument
and
it’s
also
the
government’s
argument
in
the
brief
is
a
conception
of
this
statute
which
i
think
is
inconsistent
with
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
it
enacted
it.
over
and
over,
we
hear
that
the
broader
public
interest
is
the
correction
of
all
violations
of
title
iv
and
there’s
this
little
subsidiary
thing
over
here
about
exhaustion
of
remedies
which
somehow
crept
into
the
statute
and
somehow
the
secretary
of
labor
is
stock
with
it
and
somehow
it
does
indeed
unfortunately
limit
his
power
to
proceed
in
certain
instances
but
because
it’s
such
a
little
subsidiary
thing
then
by
all
mean
it
should
be
so
narrowly
construed
that
it
limits
him
only
where
the
court
has
to
say
that
it
limits
it.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
if
one
examines
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
that
does
not
accurately
balance
the
two
concerns
that
congress
had.
to
be
sure
congress
was
concerned
with
what
it
had
found
in
the
mcclellan
committee
hearings.
there
were
it
found
and
it
is
said
a
minority
of
unions
which
had
very
undemocratic
election
procedures,
the
effect
of
which
was
that
the
incumbents
were
able
to
entrench
themselves
and
the
membership
was
not
allowed
to
have
voice
in
selecting
its
governors.
and
for
that
reason,
congress
said
and
said
it
was
doing
it
very
reluctantly.
it
imposed
what
is
undoubtedly
the
most
elaborate
set
of
procedures
and
provisions
and
requirements
governing
the
election
of
any
non-public
body
in
the
united
states.
but
congress
realized
in
the
sense
the
enormity
of
what
it
was
doing
it
was
making
a
quite
unprecedented
intrusion
into
the
affairs
of
what
have
been
thought
to
be
private
institutions.
and
so,
throughout
the
debates
and
throughout
the
senate
report
which
is
really
the
principal
explanation
of
title
iv
is
well
been
the
concern
of
congress
that
union
self
government
not
be
invaded
anymore
than
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
accomplish
this
basic
purposes
for
which
the
statute
was
being
enacted.
congress
repeatedly
said
this
are
private
institutions
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
are
honestly
and
democratically
run.
it
made
a
finding
based
on
its
hearings
that
internal
union
appellate
processes
were
in
fact
equipped
to
and
had
in
fact
dealt
adequately
with
the
since
--
that
had
been
committed
within
unions
with
only
a
few
exceptions.
and
it
modeled
the
statute
which
as
it
sought
was
going
to
balance.
on
the
one
hand
it’s
concerned
that
where
democracy
was
not
existent
that
be
a
procedure
to
assure
its
existence
and
on
the
other
a
very
critical
concern
in
this
stature
that
the
government
not
go
trampling
into
the
affairs
of
unions
anymore
than
was
absolutely
necessary.
now,
to
that
end
according
to
this
statute,
section
402
(a),
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
that
perhaps
i
might
begin
as
mr.
wallace
did
with
reading.
section
402
(a)
says,
a
member
of
a
labor
organization
who
has
exhausted
the
remedies
available
under
the
constitution
and
by
laws
of
statute
organization
not
who
has
exhausted
some
remedies,
not
who
has
exhausted
a
remedy
on
one
issue
but
who
has
exhausted
the
remedies
available
and
we
would
suggest
that
if
we
are
to
resort
to
literalism
and
we
do
not
think
we
should
that
that
word
available
in
there
suggest
rather
strongly
that
what
congress
was
saying
is
you
must
give
the
union
all
of
the
opportunities
which
it
is
affords
you
to
bring
these
issues
to
it
for
correction
in
the
first
instance
and
when
you
have
exhausted
all
of
those
remedies
which
are
available
within
the
union
then
you
may
go
on
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
and
if
it
is
found
that
the
union
through
the
procedures
that
it
provides
has
not
adequately
dealt
with
an
allegation
of
the
statute.
then
in
default
of
its
correcting
the
problems,
the
secretary
of
labor
may
move
in.
there
was
no
default
in
this
case,
the
meeting-attendance
rule
which
is
the
issue
as
to
which
we
have
this
question
was
never
raise
within
the
union
and
though
there’s
talk
about
well
we
can’t
expect
members
to
be
able
to
draft
complaints
to
the
union
like
lawyers
would
and
we
can’t
expect
them
to
be
articulate.
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
this
isn’t
a
case
where
the
failure
to
raise
this
issue
was
in
artful
draftsmanship
or
a
lack
of
understanding.
this
is
was
candidate
for
the
president
who
had
himself
qualified
under
the
meeting-attendance
rule.
he
was
not
complaining
about
the
meeting-attendance
rule.
he
was
eligible
under
it.
he
was
complaining
because
one
of
his
opponents
had
run
off
a
leaflet
on
the
union’s
mimeograph
machine.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely
not,
he
run
he
was
on
the
ballot
and
he
was
defeated
and
having
been
defeated,
he
challenged
the
election
because
his
opponent,
he
challenged
it
within
the
union
because
his
opponent
had
run
off
a
leaflet
on
the
union’s
mimeograph
machine
and
he
had
not
been
told.
though
he
knew
it
had
happened,
he
had
not
been
told
that
he
had
permission
to
do
the
same.
now,
he
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
were
other
issues
which
the
secretary
agrees
that
he
raised
within
the
union
that
the
secretary
agrees
were
without
merit.
none
of
them
related
to
the
other
issue
which
the
secretary
raised
in
this
lawsuit
which
was
the
meeting-attendance
rule.
he
complained
about
the
placement
of
the
voting
booths
and
some
other
things
within
the
union.
the
union
found
those
complaints
without
merit
and
so
did
the
secretary.
but
for
our
relevant
purposes
he
did
raise
within
the
union
the
complaint
about
his
opponent
using
the
mimeograph
machine.
and
as
the
secretary
conceded
and
answered
to
an
interrogatory.
he
did
not
raise
within
the
union.
any
question
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
meeting-attendance
rule
under
which
he
had
in
fact
qualified.
now,
the
union
heard
those
issues
which
he
did
raise
and
concluded
that
the
election
should
not
be
set
aside
for
any
of
them.
he
then
filed
a
complaint
to
the
secretary
which
the
secretary
construes
as
having
raised
the
reasonableness
of
the
meeting-attendance
role.
i
think
if
you
read
it,
it
is
not
that
clear
that
it
raise
that.
what
he
was
really
complaining
about
was
not
the
existence
of
the
rule
but
the
fact
that
he
claimed
and
the
court
ultimately
found
to
the
contrary
but
he
claimed
that
the
rule
had
not
been
adequately
communicated
to
the
members
so
that
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
obligated
to
attend
the
meetings
in
order
to
run.
and
prior
to
trial,
we
had
interviewed
the
complainant
and
asked
him
whether
he
had
intended
to
raise
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule
with
the
secretary
and
he
said,
“no
it’s
a
great
rule.
i
am
all
for
it.”
and
at
trial,
we
began
to
asked
him
questions
says
to
whether
he
thought
the
rule
was
necessary
for
the
well-being
of
the
union
and
the
government
objected
and
they
said,
“we
don’t
think
the
views
of
any
one
man
are
relevant
to
the
resolution
of
this
question.
this
is
in
the
record.”
and
therefore
we
don’t
think
the
court
should
allow
the
complaining
witness
to
state
whether
he
is
or
is
not
in
agreement
with
this
rule
and
the
judge
sustained
that
objection.
so
the
record
does
not
show
the
view
of
the
complainant.
i
can
only
state
that
it
was
our
expectation
that
had
he
been
allowed
to
answer
that
question
he
would
have
said
that
a
man
cannot
be
an
adequate
officer
of
this
union
unless
he
has
attended
the
meetings.
so
it’s
doubtful
to
us
that
he
even
raised
the
question
in
his
complaint
to
the
secretary,
although
the
secretary
claims
that
he
did.
but
in
any
event
raising
it
in
the
complaint
to
the
secretary
is
not
sufficient
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute
because
the
statute
quite
clearly
requires
as
we
read
it,
that
a
member
have
exhausted
it
within
the
union
and
i
think
this
can
be
most
easily
demonstrated
by
examining
the
case
which
the
secretary
admits
that
is
if
a
member
does
not
exhaust
any
issue
within
the
union
then
the
secretary
concedes
no
matter
how
egregious
that
election,
no
matter
how
outrageous
the
violations
of
title
iv.
the
secretary
may
not
institute
a
lawsuit
to
set
that
election
aside.
he
may
indeed
investigate
and
publish
his
condemnation
of
it
but
he
may
not
institute
a
lawsuit
to
set
it
aside.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
we
don’t
your
honor
and
i
think
when
i
explained
what
we
understand
to
be
the
purposes
of
the
exhaustion,
it
will
become
clear
why
we
don’t
view
them
as
an
adequate
substitute.
but
i
might
begin
by
saying
that
if
i
understand
the
secretary’s
position,
he
doesn’t
view
it
as
an
adequate
substitute
either
in
those
cases
where
no
issue
was
exhausted
before
the
union.
in
other
words,
if
there’s
no
complaint
within
the
union,
a
member
simply
goes
directly
to
the
secretary.
if
we
understand
the
secretary’s
position,
he
is
not
claiming
that
by
giving
the
union
notice
before
his
sues
that
that’s
an
adequate
substitute
for
exhaustion.
in
any
event,
let’s
look
at
that
case
no
matter
how
egregious
the
violation
if
we
understand
the
secretary,
he
can’t
sue
without
some
complaint
within
the
union.
but
now
says
the
secretary,
if
there’s
a
complaint
about
something
no
matter
irrelevant
within
the
union.
if
a
member
files
a
complaint
saying
i
stub
my
toe
on
the
way
to
the
voting
booth
and
therefore
this
election
may
be
set
aside.
then
says
the
secretary,
all
of
these
egregious
things
that
happened
are
now
open
to
the
correction
of
the
secretary.
well,
that
seems
very
salutary.
it’s
always
nice
to
have
egregious
violations
corrected.
but
could
it
conceivably
have
been
congress’
intension
to
adopt
so
quick
studied
statute.
why
would
congress
say
that
no
matter
how
egregious
the
election
unless
a
member
exhaust
within
the
union,
the
secretary
can’t
proceed.
but
if
he
exhaust
about
anything
no
matter
how
irrelevant,
that
exhaustion
opens
the
door
for
the
secretary
to
come
through
and
then
correct
all
of
these
things
which
are
otherwise
not
beyond
his
reach.
just
from
a
logical
analysis,
it
wouldn’t
make
sense
for
congress
to
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
and
if
one
looks
indeed
at
what
congress
thought
was
going
to
be
served
by
the
exhaustion
requirement,
it
becomes
clear
that
not
only
is
it
illogical
but
it’s
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
was
as
i
stated
earlier
pre-occupied
with
its
concern
to
foster
union
self-government
and
as
the
senate
report
put
it,
to
keep
the
government’s
hands
off
the
unions
to
the
maximum
extent
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
i
believe
the
government’s
brief
rather
got
carried
away
on
that
point
and
if
i
may
i’ll
explain
what
happen.
in
19
--
this
bill
was
enacted
in
1959
and
it
was
the
kennedy
urban
bill
which
lead
to
title
iv.
in
1958
there
was
bill
called
the
kennedy-ives
bill,
introduced
and
passed
by
the
senate
but
not
by
the
house,
and
that
bill
as
passed
by
the
senate
had
exactly
this
language
which
appears
in
the
final
statute
but
because
it
was
not
passed
by
the
house,
it
came
up
again
in
1959
for
reconsideration
by
the
senate.
in
1959,
several
other
proposed
bills
were
also
introduced
in
the
senate.
one
of
which
was
introduced
by
senator
mundt
and
that
was
senate
bill
number
1002
and
that’s
the
one
which
the
government
refers
it.
senator
mundt’s
bill
was
completely
different
from
this.
it
required
no
exhaustion
of
remedies
within
the
union
at
all
but
it
prescribed
some
rules
about
how
election
would
have
to
be
conducted.
and
it
said
if
2%
of
the
members
of
the
union
are
dissatisfied
or
think
a
violation
has
occurred
they
may,
by
signing
a
petition
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor
alleging
that
a
violation
has
occurred
and
the
secretary
may
then
bring
a
lawsuit
challenging
such
violation.
now
that’s
where
that
language
came
from
that
they
cite
as
the
competing
bill
before
congress.
that
bill
in
fact
never
saw
the
light
of
day.
it’s
doubtful
if
anyone
other
than
senator
mundt
ever
read
it.
at
least
when
the
floor
debates
on
the
kennedy-ervin
bill
were
going
on,
senator
mundt
said
that
his
bill
had
been
given
short
shrift
in
the
committee
and
nobody
had
paid
any
attention
to
it
and
he
was
very
regretful
about
that.
but
the
fact
is
that
that
bill
was
never
seriously
before
the
senate
for
consideration.
the
language
as
it
appears
in
it's
final
form
had
been
adopted
a
year
prior
to
that
in
1958
was
simply
carried
forward
again
in
1959
and
readopted
by
the
senate
without
change
in
any
of
these
salient
points
so
that,
i
mean
it
does
use
the
words
“a
violation”
but
i
don’t
think
you
can
draw
any
inference
that
there
was
a
conscious
decision
by
congress
to
use
the
words
a
violation
rather
than
such
violation.
since
if
senator
mundt
is
to
be
believed,
no
one
else
ever
even
knew
that
his
bill
and
its
words
such
violation
was
even
before
them
for
competing
consideration.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
if
you
read
words
“a
violation”
in
context
they
don’t
mean
any
violation.
it
says
the
secretary
shall
investigate
such
complaint
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred.
now,
i
think
that
that
fairly
read
and
particularly
read
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
means
a
violation
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right,
i
mean
that
is
certainly
a
reading
of
it.
if
you
had
not
be
able
to
use
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that’s
correct
and
we
suggest
that
that
reading
is
both
consistent
with
the
structure
of
these
two
provisions.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
again
that
goes
to
whether
he
can
that
and
to
decide
whether
he
can
do
that
you
have
to
go
back
402
(a).
so
we
say
when
you
read
them
together
what
it
say
is
you
can
complain
to
the
secretary
about
that
which
you
exhausted
within
the
union
and
the
secretary
may
sue
with
respect
to
any
violation
about
which
you
complaint
which
means
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
may
investigate.
he
may
not
file
a
lawsuit
on
other
than
the
one.
he
may
not
file
a
lawsuit
on
any
issue
except
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
now,
that
resolve
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
there’s
still
time
consistent
with
the
unions
rules
for
the
member
to
go
back
and
exhaust,
then
undoubtedly
he
would
be
free
to
go
back
and
exhaust
and
bring
it
to
the
secretary.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
normally,
the
timing
in
such
that
that
wouldn’t
be
a
feasible
alternative
because
the
time
for
exhausting
was
in
the
union
would
have
expired
under
the
union’s
own
rules.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
not
cause
i
think
the
first
and
most
basic
canon
of
construction
is
to
discern
what
congress
intended
to
do
which
is
the
discernible
for
the
legislative
history
that
i
want
to
get
to
in
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
perhaps
not
so
much
with
this
statute
as
with
others.
this
court
is
made
very
clear
in
other
cases
dealing
with
this
various
section
that
this
is
not
a
statute
which
can
be
lead
--
read
literally
that
in
view
of
the
competing
and
contending
forces
that
when
into
it
so
construction
and
the
changes
that
were
made
on
the
floor,
etcetera,
etcetera
this
is
a
statute
that
has
to
be
approach
with
caution
as
to
it's
construction
and
that
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that’s
what
this
court
said
your
honor.
it
said
this
provision
said
labor
legislations
generally
and
this
statute
in
particular
cannot
be
read
literally
but
must
be
read
in
terms
of
the
purposes
which
congress
sought
to
serve
in
its
enactment
which
can
be
discerned
from
the
legislative
history.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
believe
it
was
the
laborers
case.
there
were
two
decided
on
the
same
day
laborers
and
glass
bottle
blowers
and
in
one
of
those
and
perhaps
in
both
the
court
made
the
statement
that
it
cannot
be
read
literally.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
has
your
honor.
indeed
it’s
glass
bottle
blowers
that
this
portion
is
quoted
in
page
32
of
our
brief.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
literal
reading
leads
to
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
i
mean
you
can
read
--
you
can
literally
read
this
to
mean
whatever
you
want
it
to
mean
and
i
think
that’s
why
this
assumption
about
how
one
can
construes
labor
legislation
began
was
that
you
can
read
things
to
reach
whatever
result
you
want.
if
you
read
the
senate
report
i
think
you
get
more
guidance
in
the
ambiguity
as
a
somewhat
resolve.
as
we
say
--
as
we
read
the
senate
report
this
--
the
exhaustion
requirement
was
intended
to
serve
four
functions.
number
one,
congress
didn’t
want
the
secretary
to
be
an
agent
at
large
bringing
lawsuits
wherever
he
thought
unions
weren’t
doing
things
right.
this
was
a
union
democracy
statute
as
mr.
wallace
said.
congress
wanted
to
allow
the
secretary
to
act
where
the
member
were
dissatisfied
with
the
way
their
union
was
being
run
and
if
the
members
are
not
dissatisfied
with
the
meeting-attendance
rule,
congress
didn’t
want
the
secretary
trampling
in
challenging
it
absent
their
consent.
now,
that
purpose
can’t
be
served
at
all
if
the
secretary
is
free
that
allege
anything
he
wants
to
allege
because
as
here
he
can
then
allege
things
as
to
which
there’s
no
indication
of
membership
dissatisfaction.
the
second
thing
congress
wanted
to
serve
by
this
is
that
it
wanted
to
instill
in
the
membership
respect
for
union
for
tribunals,
and
it
wanted
union
tribunals
to
function
as
administrative
agencies
notwithstanding
the
government’s
assertion
to
the
contrary.
this
court
said
that
it
was
congress’
emphatic
intention
that
unions
would
be
the
principal
enforcement
agencies
of
the
statute
and
so
congress
wanted
members
to
see
that
their
tribunals
would
indeed
be
available
for
the
resolution
of
these
problems.
now,
members
are
not
going
to
be
encouraged
to
take
their
disputes
to
the
union’s
tribunals
for
resolution
if
they
know
that
they
can
just
throw
any
old
thing
into
the
union
and
then
go
to
the
secretary
afterward
and
he’ll
take
it
whether
the
union
have
it
or
not.
and
indeed
when
unions
in
fact
they’re
behaving
in
a
responsible
fashion
as
indeed
the
steelworkers
is
in
resolving
election
disputes.
is
this
union
over
a
period
of
60
--
1964
through
1967?
it
provided
corrective
action
and
the
majority
of
the
election
complaints
that
came
before
it
and
so
it
was
doing
the
job
that
congress
hope
and
expected
unions
to
do.
but
if
the
members
see
that
the
union
tribunal
is
just
willfully
overruled
by
the
secretary
who
brings
the
lawsuits
then
i
cannot
be
convinced
that
this
union
is
doing
their
job
and
they’re
going
to
lose
their
motivation
to
bring
the
problems
to
the
union
for
correction.
now,
to
be
sure
if
the
union
has
fair
notice
of
a
problem
and
doesn’t
do
anything
about
it
then
it
deserves
to
disrepute
which
its
own
internal
proceedings
are
brought
to.
but
whereas
here
the
union
has
no
notice
whatsoever
that
an
issue
is
being
challenged
and
the
reason
it
has
no
such
notice
is
that
indeed
the
issue
is
not
being
challenged
by
any
of
its
member.
it
does
nothing
but
bring
the
union’s
tribunal
into
disrepute
for
the
membership
to
see
that
notwithstanding
without
the
union’s
action
the
secretary
of
labor
has
then
institute
a
lawsuit
to
set
that
election
aside.
and
finally,
this
statute
was
designed
with
very
specific
time
limits
in
mind
in
the
hopes
that
union
problems
would
be
corrected
very
promptly.
and
what
the
secretary’s
construction
means
is
that
particular
kinds
of
election
problems
can
be
raise
for
the
first
time.
many
months
in
this
case
it
was
four
to
five
months
after
the
elections
been
decided
and
long
after
all
of
the
union
internal
correction
procedures
had
been
exhausted.
the
senate
report
said
that
it
was
putting
the
time
limits
into
this
statute
because
time
as
of
the
essence
that’s
their
words.
time
sees
us
to
be
at
the
essence
when
five
months
later
the
secretary
as
a
result
of
it's
own
views
about
what’s
good
and
what’s
bad
in
union
can
raise
for
the
first
time
issues
which
were
never
raise
within
the
union.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we’re
ambivalent
about
that.
there’s
most
of
the
purposes
for
which
the
exhaustion
rule
was
designed
would
not
be
violated
by
allowing
the
secretary
to
get
what
amounted
to
a
declaratory
judgment
that
in
the
election
which
has
been
set
aside
for
another
reason.
this
thing
will
be
done
the
way
the
secretary
claims
it
must
be
done
under
the
statute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
is
except
for
one
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
except
but
it’s
not
really
essential
and
i’ll
explain
why.
there
is
one
purpose
of
the
exhaustion
which
would
not
be
served
by
that
and
that’s
the
purpose
that
unless
the
membership
unhappy
things
are
not
to
be
changed
which
i
stated
was
the
first
of
the
purpose
isn’t
the
only
one
incidentally
that
the
secretary
acknowledges
in
the
brief.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that’s
right
but
the
act
also
says
that
unless
somebody
is
unhappy
with
that
election
you
are
going
to
carry
out
it's
not
subject
to
challenge
so
you
get
the
following
–
you
get
the
following
do
a
problem.
under
one
hand,
if
all
of
the
members
are
delighted
with
the
meeting-attendance
rule
take
the
extreme
case,
every
one
of
the
million
in
quarter
steelworkers
signs
a
thing
saying,
“i
think
this
is
a
great
rule.”
congress
quite
clearly
didn’t
want
the
secretary
to
be
able
to
get
that
rule
set
aside
even
though
it
might
be
technically
a
violation.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
this
court
concludes
that
irrespective
of
membership
satisfaction,
the
new
election
must
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
t
title
--
with
the
every
requirement
of
title
iv
even
though
the
members
might
refer
it
another
way,
then
we
would
have
no
problem
with
the
court
saying
that
the
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
this
issue
can
be
made
not
for
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
anything
because
of
that
adjudication
but
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
union
and
the
secretary
as
to
how
a
rerun
ordered
for
other
reasons
is
to
be
conducted.
and
indeed
we
told
that
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
recall
that
we
won
this
case
in
a
district
court
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
said
the
meeting-attendance
rule
is
reasonable.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
for
the
first
time
made
the
argument
while
even
if
we’re
not
allowed
to
challenge
the
election
on
this
ground,
we
ought
to
be
entitled
to
guidance
if
we’re
to
rerun
the
election
for
the
president
for
other
reasons.
we
ought
to
have
guidance
as
to
how
to
do
something
and
we
indicated
that
we
had
no
serious
objection
with
the
court
deciding
the
issue
for
that
limited
purpose
not
for
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
the
election
of
all
11
officers
which
is
what
the
secretary
seeks
initially,
but
for
the
purpose
simply
of
instructing
the
parties
on
how
to
rerun
is
to
be
conducted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
no,
there
is
disagreement
between
the
secretary
and
us
as
to
what
he
complained
about
to
the
secretary.
his
words
were
ambiguous.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
said
the
union
conducted
the
election
under
a
rule
which
was
unfair.
a
meeting-attendance
rule
which
was
unfair
i'm
characterizing
it
because
it
was
not
adequately
communicated
to
the
members.
now,
the
secretary
said
he
was
complaining
about
both
the
unfairness
of
the
rule
as
such
and
the
failure
to
communicate.
we
say
no
he
was
only
complaining
about
authority
to
communicate
the
rule
and
we
were
prepared
to
have
him
testify
and
expected
fully
that
he
would
testify
but
that
he
was
only
complaining.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh!
yes,
irrelevant
under
ours.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely!
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
it's
irrelevant
under
ours
but
there
is
at
least
a
possible
middle
ground
of
saying
that
he
can
sue
about
--
the
secretary
can
sue
about
what’s
raise
in
the
complaint.
the
secretary
has
sort
of
alluded
to
that
middle
ground
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
even
if
there
were
such
a
middle
ground
which
we
don’t
agree
with,
we
say
you
got
exhaust
it
in
the
union.
even
if
there
were
such
a
middle
ground
this
record
would
not
justify
allowing
and
to
sue
on
that.
now,
i’d
like
to
turn
on
my
remaining
few
moments
to
the
meeting-attendance
rule
and
it's
reasonableness
as
so.
the
secretary
repeatedly
talks
about
this
is
just
like
hotel
employees
this
is
a
case
were
a
rule
has
disqualified
or
has
rendered
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
union
ineligible
to
run
for
that.
the
single
thing
i
would
most
like
to
emphasize
is
that
this
rule
disqualified
nobody.
every
single
member
of
this
union
and
the
secretary
conceded
it
could
qualify
under
this
rule
and
could
qualify
without
difficulty.
all
you
had
to
do
was
attend
11
meetings
over
the
course
of
a
21-month
period.
the
secretary
of
labor
had
a
regulation
published.
it
is
still
publish
today.
expressly
stating
that
a
meeting-attendance
requirement
requiring
50%
attendance
at
the
meeting
is
over
a
two-year
period
is
a
reasonable
rule
unless
there
is
difficulty
in
attendance.
we
are
ironically
here
defending
the
post
--
the
secretary’s
publish
regulation.
he
ironically
is
here
attacking
it.
and
the
basis
of
his
attack
is
that
well
it's
true
that’s
what
my
regulation
says
but
from
time
to
time
i
change
my
mind
and
indeed
as
the
record
on
this
case
showed
he
changed
that
often.
on
the
question
whether
and
otherwise
reasonable
rule
should
be
set
aside
because
in
fact
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
member
choose
to
qualify
themselves
under
it
by
attending
the
meetings.
six
months
before
this
election
was
held,
the
secretary
stated
he
conducted
a
review
and
had
determined
that
the
small
percentage
should
not
invalidate
the
rule
precisely
because
anybody
could
attend
to
one
or
two
and
if
they
chose
not
too
that’s
their
own
choice.
after
we
held
our
election,
he
changed
his
mind
again
and
decided
to
sue
us.
so
we
got
caught
betwixt
and
between.
what
we
did
was
lawful
when
done
but
unlawful
when
the
secretary
change
his
mind
again.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh!
we
strongly
urge
you
to
pass
on
and
then
the
reason
urge
it
is
that
the
secretary
has
now
brought
lawsuits
against
15
steelworker
local
unions
challenging
this
identical
meeting-attendance
rule.
they’re
in
just
about
every
circuit
in
the
united
states
and
we
will
be
involved
in
endless
litigation
over
this
issue
which
will
undoubtedly
result
in
a
conflict
and
will
undoubtedly
get
back
here
anyway.
and
since
the
issue
is
before
the
court
at
this
time,
if
you
conclude
that
the
issue
was
properly
raised
then
therefore
before
you
we
strongly
urge
that
you
reach
it
and
decide
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
he
does.
i
think
he
does.
one
think
i’d
like
to
say
about
percentages
because
that’s
really
the
only
argument
that
the
secretary’s
got
here
only
a
small
percentage
in
fact
chose
to
qualify.
the
fact
is
that
of
the
27
people
who
sought
to
run
for
office
23
qualified
and
that
proves
a
rather
salient
fact
which
is
as
only
a
small
percentage
of
people
in
any
institution
who
want
to
run
for
office
and
if
those
who
do
given
reasonable
requirements
for
qualifying
the
best
majority
will
in
fact
qualify.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
honestly
don’t
recall.
there
is
one
other
with
the
three-year
rule
but
this
election
was
only
a
21-month
rule
because
it
was
a
new
local
union
so
that
the
court
need
not
in
this
case
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
three-year
rule
but
only
a
21-month
rule.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
the
principal
thrust
of
mr.
wallace’s
argument
and
it’s
also
the
government’s
argument
in
the
brief
is
a
conception
of
this
statute
which
i
think
is
inconsistent
with
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
it
enacted
it.
over
and
over,
we
hear
that
the
broader
public
interest
is
the
correction
of
all
violations
of
title
iv
and
there’s
this
little
subsidiary
thing
over
here
about
exhaustion
of
remedies
which
somehow
crept
into
the
statute
and
somehow
the
secretary
of
labor
is
stock
with
it
and
somehow
it
does
indeed
unfortunately
limit
his
power
to
proceed
in
certain
instances
but
because
it’s
such
a
little
subsidiary
thing
then
by
all
mean
it
should
be
so
narrowly
construed
that
it
limits
him
only
where
the
court
has
to
say
that
it
limits
it.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
if
one
examines
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
that
does
not
accurately
balance
the
two
concerns
that
congress
had.
to
be
sure
congress
was
concerned
with
what
it
had
found
in
the
mcclellan
committee
hearings.
there
were
it
found
and
it
is
said
a
minority
of
unions
which
had
very
undemocratic
election
procedures,
the
effect
of
which
was
that
the
incumbents
were
able
to
entrench
themselves
and
the
membership
was
not
allowed
to
have
voice
in
selecting
its
governors.
and
for
that
reason,
congress
said
and
said
it
was
doing
it
very
reluctantly.
it
imposed
what
is
undoubtedly
the
most
elaborate
set
of
procedures
and
provisions
and
requirements
governing
the
election
of
any
non-public
body
in
the
united
states.
but
congress
realized
in
the
sense
the
enormity
of
what
it
was
doing
it
was
making
a
quite
unprecedented
intrusion
into
the
affairs
of
what
have
been
thought
to
be
private
institutions.
and
so,
throughout
the
debates
and
throughout
the
senate
report
which
is
really
the
principal
explanation
of
title
iv
is
well
been
the
concern
of
congress
that
union
self
government
not
be
invaded
anymore
than
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
accomplish
this
basic
purposes
for
which
the
statute
was
being
enacted.
congress
repeatedly
said
this
are
private
institutions
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
are
honestly
and
democratically
run.
it
made
a
finding
based
on
its
hearings
that
internal
union
appellate
processes
were
in
fact
equipped
to
and
had
in
fact
dealt
adequately
with
the
since
--
that
had
been
committed
within
unions
with
only
a
few
exceptions.
and
it
modeled
the
statute
which
as
it
sought
was
going
to
balance.
on
the
one
hand
it’s
concerned
that
where
democracy
was
not
existent
that
be
a
procedure
to
assure
its
existence
and
on
the
other
a
very
critical
concern
in
this
stature
that
the
government
not
go
trampling
into
the
affairs
of
unions
anymore
than
was
absolutely
necessary.
now,
to
that
end
according
to
this
statute,
section
402
(a),
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
that
perhaps
i
might
begin
as
mr.
wallace
did
with
reading.
section
402
(a)
says,
a
member
of
a
labor
organization
who
has
exhausted
the
remedies
available
under
the
constitution
and
by
laws
of
statute
organization
not
who
has
exhausted
some
remedies,
not
who
has
exhausted
a
remedy
on
one
issue
but
who
has
exhausted
the
remedies
available
and
we
would
suggest
that
if
we
are
to
resort
to
literalism
and
we
do
not
think
we
should
that
that
word
available
in
there
suggest
rather
strongly
that
what
congress
was
saying
is
you
must
give
the
union
all
of
the
opportunities
which
it
is
affords
you
to
bring
these
issues
to
it
for
correction
in
the
first
instance
and
when
you
have
exhausted
all
of
those
remedies
which
are
available
within
the
union
then
you
may
go
on
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
and
if
it
is
found
that
the
union
through
the
procedures
that
it
provides
has
not
adequately
dealt
with
an
allegation
of
the
statute.
then
in
default
of
its
correcting
the
problems,
the
secretary
of
labor
may
move
in.
there
was
no
default
in
this
case,
the
meeting-attendance
rule
which
is
the
issue
as
to
which
we
have
this
question
was
never
raise
within
the
union
and
though
there’s
talk
about
well
we
can’t
expect
members
to
be
able
to
draft
complaints
to
the
union
like
lawyers
would
and
we
can’t
expect
them
to
be
articulate.
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
this
isn’t
a
case
where
the
failure
to
raise
this
issue
was
in
artful
draftsmanship
or
a
lack
of
understanding.
this
is
was
candidate
for
the
president
who
had
himself
qualified
under
the
meeting-attendance
rule.
he
was
not
complaining
about
the
meeting-attendance
rule.
he
was
eligible
under
it.
he
was
complaining
because
one
of
his
opponents
had
run
off
a
leaflet
on
the
union’s
mimeograph
machine.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely
not,
he
run
he
was
on
the
ballot
and
he
was
defeated
and
having
been
defeated,
he
challenged
the
election
because
his
opponent,
he
challenged
it
within
the
union
because
his
opponent
had
run
off
a
leaflet
on
the
union’s
mimeograph
machine
and
he
had
not
been
told.
though
he
knew
it
had
happened,
he
had
not
been
told
that
he
had
permission
to
do
the
same.
now,
he
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
were
other
issues
which
the
secretary
agrees
that
he
raised
within
the
union
that
the
secretary
agrees
were
without
merit.
none
of
them
related
to
the
other
issue
which
the
secretary
raised
in
this
lawsuit
which
was
the
meeting-attendance
rule.
he
complained
about
the
placement
of
the
voting
booths
and
some
other
things
within
the
union.
the
union
found
those
complaints
without
merit
and
so
did
the
secretary.
but
for
our
relevant
purposes
he
did
raise
within
the
union
the
complaint
about
his
opponent
using
the
mimeograph
machine.
and
as
the
secretary
conceded
and
answered
to
an
interrogatory.
he
did
not
raise
within
the
union.
any
question
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
meeting-attendance
rule
under
which
he
had
in
fact
qualified.
now,
the
union
heard
those
issues
which
he
did
raise
and
concluded
that
the
election
should
not
be
set
aside
for
any
of
them.
he
then
filed
a
complaint
to
the
secretary
which
the
secretary
construes
as
having
raised
the
reasonableness
of
the
meeting-attendance
role.
i
think
if
you
read
it,
it
is
not
that
clear
that
it
raise
that.
what
he
was
really
complaining
about
was
not
the
existence
of
the
rule
but
the
fact
that
he
claimed
and
the
court
ultimately
found
to
the
contrary
but
he
claimed
that
the
rule
had
not
been
adequately
communicated
to
the
members
so
that
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
obligated
to
attend
the
meetings
in
order
to
run.
and
prior
to
trial,
we
had
interviewed
the
complainant
and
asked
him
whether
he
had
intended
to
raise
the
reasonableness
of
the
rule
with
the
secretary
and
he
said,
“no
it’s
a
great
rule.
i
am
all
for
it.”
and
at
trial,
we
began
to
asked
him
questions
says
to
whether
he
thought
the
rule
was
necessary
for
the
well-being
of
the
union
and
the
government
objected
and
they
said,
“we
don’t
think
the
views
of
any
one
man
are
relevant
to
the
resolution
of
this
question.
this
is
in
the
record.”
and
therefore
we
don’t
think
the
court
should
allow
the
complaining
witness
to
state
whether
he
is
or
is
not
in
agreement
with
this
rule
and
the
judge
sustained
that
objection.
so
the
record
does
not
show
the
view
of
the
complainant.
i
can
only
state
that
it
was
our
expectation
that
had
he
been
allowed
to
answer
that
question
he
would
have
said
that
a
man
cannot
be
an
adequate
officer
of
this
union
unless
he
has
attended
the
meetings.
so
it’s
doubtful
to
us
that
he
even
raised
the
question
in
his
complaint
to
the
secretary,
although
the
secretary
claims
that
he
did.
but
in
any
event
raising
it
in
the
complaint
to
the
secretary
is
not
sufficient
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute
because
the
statute
quite
clearly
requires
as
we
read
it,
that
a
member
have
exhausted
it
within
the
union
and
i
think
this
can
be
most
easily
demonstrated
by
examining
the
case
which
the
secretary
admits
that
is
if
a
member
does
not
exhaust
any
issue
within
the
union
then
the
secretary
concedes
no
matter
how
egregious
that
election,
no
matter
how
outrageous
the
violations
of
title
iv.
the
secretary
may
not
institute
a
lawsuit
to
set
that
election
aside.
he
may
indeed
investigate
and
publish
his
condemnation
of
it
but
he
may
not
institute
a
lawsuit
to
set
it
aside.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
we
don’t
your
honor
and
i
think
when
i
explained
what
we
understand
to
be
the
purposes
of
the
exhaustion,
it
will
become
clear
why
we
don’t
view
them
as
an
adequate
substitute.
but
i
might
begin
by
saying
that
if
i
understand
the
secretary’s
position,
he
doesn’t
view
it
as
an
adequate
substitute
either
in
those
cases
where
no
issue
was
exhausted
before
the
union.
in
other
words,
if
there’s
no
complaint
within
the
union,
a
member
simply
goes
directly
to
the
secretary.
if
we
understand
the
secretary’s
position,
he
is
not
claiming
that
by
giving
the
union
notice
before
his
sues
that
that’s
an
adequate
substitute
for
exhaustion.
in
any
event,
let’s
look
at
that
case
no
matter
how
egregious
the
violation
if
we
understand
the
secretary,
he
can’t
sue
without
some
complaint
within
the
union.
but
now
says
the
secretary,
if
there’s
a
complaint
about
something
no
matter
irrelevant
within
the
union.
if
a
member
files
a
complaint
saying
i
stub
my
toe
on
the
way
to
the
voting
booth
and
therefore
this
election
may
be
set
aside.
then
says
the
secretary,
all
of
these
egregious
things
that
happened
are
now
open
to
the
correction
of
the
secretary.
well,
that
seems
very
salutary.
it’s
always
nice
to
have
egregious
violations
corrected.
but
could
it
conceivably
have
been
congress’
intension
to
adopt
so
quick
studied
statute.
why
would
congress
say
that
no
matter
how
egregious
the
election
unless
a
member
exhaust
within
the
union,
the
secretary
can’t
proceed.
but
if
he
exhaust
about
anything
no
matter
how
irrelevant,
that
exhaustion
opens
the
door
for
the
secretary
to
come
through
and
then
correct
all
of
these
things
which
are
otherwise
not
beyond
his
reach.
just
from
a
logical
analysis,
it
wouldn’t
make
sense
for
congress
to
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
and
if
one
looks
indeed
at
what
congress
thought
was
going
to
be
served
by
the
exhaustion
requirement,
it
becomes
clear
that
not
only
is
it
illogical
but
it’s
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
was
as
i
stated
earlier
pre-occupied
with
its
concern
to
foster
union
self-government
and
as
the
senate
report
put
it,
to
keep
the
government’s
hands
off
the
unions
to
the
maximum
extent
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
i
believe
the
government’s
brief
rather
got
carried
away
on
that
point
and
if
i
may
i’ll
explain
what
happen.
in
19
--
this
bill
was
enacted
in
1959
and
it
was
the
kennedy
urban
bill
which
lead
to
title
iv.
in
1958
there
was
bill
called
the
kennedy-ives
bill,
introduced
and
passed
by
the
senate
but
not
by
the
house,
and
that
bill
as
passed
by
the
senate
had
exactly
this
language
which
appears
in
the
final
statute
but
because
it
was
not
passed
by
the
house,
it
came
up
again
in
1959
for
reconsideration
by
the
senate.
in
1959,
several
other
proposed
bills
were
also
introduced
in
the
senate.
one
of
which
was
introduced
by
senator
mundt
and
that
was
senate
bill
number
1002
and
that’s
the
one
which
the
government
refers
it.
senator
mundt’s
bill
was
completely
different
from
this.
it
required
no
exhaustion
of
remedies
within
the
union
at
all
but
it
prescribed
some
rules
about
how
election
would
have
to
be
conducted.
and
it
said
if
2%
of
the
members
of
the
union
are
dissatisfied
or
think
a
violation
has
occurred
they
may,
by
signing
a
petition
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor
alleging
that
a
violation
has
occurred
and
the
secretary
may
then
bring
a
lawsuit
challenging
such
violation.
now
that’s
where
that
language
came
from
that
they
cite
as
the
competing
bill
before
congress.
that
bill
in
fact
never
saw
the
light
of
day.
it’s
doubtful
if
anyone
other
than
senator
mundt
ever
read
it.
at
least
when
the
floor
debates
on
the
kennedy-ervin
bill
were
going
on,
senator
mundt
said
that
his
bill
had
been
given
short
shrift
in
the
committee
and
nobody
had
paid
any
attention
to
it
and
he
was
very
regretful
about
that.
but
the
fact
is
that
that
bill
was
never
seriously
before
the
senate
for
consideration.
the
language
as
it
appears
in
it's
final
form
had
been
adopted
a
year
prior
to
that
in
1958
was
simply
carried
forward
again
in
1959
and
readopted
by
the
senate
without
change
in
any
of
these
salient
points
so
that,
i
mean
it
does
use
the
words
“a
violation”
but
i
don’t
think
you
can
draw
any
inference
that
there
was
a
conscious
decision
by
congress
to
use
the
words
a
violation
rather
than
such
violation.
since
if
senator
mundt
is
to
be
believed,
no
one
else
ever
even
knew
that
his
bill
and
its
words
such
violation
was
even
before
them
for
competing
consideration.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
if
you
read
words
“a
violation”
in
context
they
don’t
mean
any
violation.
it
says
the
secretary
shall
investigate
such
complaint
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred.
now,
i
think
that
that
fairly
read
and
particularly
read
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
means
a
violation
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right,
i
mean
that
is
certainly
a
reading
of
it.
if
you
had
not
be
able
to
use
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that’s
correct
and
we
suggest
that
that
reading
is
both
consistent
with
the
structure
of
these
two
provisions.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
again
that
goes
to
whether
he
can
that
and
to
decide
whether
he
can
do
that
you
have
to
go
back
402
(a).
so
we
say
when
you
read
them
together
what
it
say
is
you
can
complain
to
the
secretary
about
that
which
you
exhausted
within
the
union
and
the
secretary
may
sue
with
respect
to
any
violation
about
which
you
complaint
which
means
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
may
investigate.
he
may
not
file
a
lawsuit
on
other
than
the
one.
he
may
not
file
a
lawsuit
on
any
issue
except
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
now,
that
resolve
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
there’s
still
time
consistent
with
the
unions
rules
for
the
member
to
go
back
and
exhaust,
then
undoubtedly
he
would
be
free
to
go
back
and
exhaust
and
bring
it
to
the
secretary.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
normally,
the
timing
in
such
that
that
wouldn’t
be
a
feasible
alternative
because
the
time
for
exhausting
was
in
the
union
would
have
expired
under
the
union’s
own
rules.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
not
cause
i
think
the
first
and
most
basic
canon
of
construction
is
to
discern
what
congress
intended
to
do
which
is
the
discernible
for
the
legislative
history
that
i
want
to
get
to
in
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
perhaps
not
so
much
with
this
statute
as
with
others.
this
court
is
made
very
clear
in
other
cases
dealing
with
this
various
section
that
this
is
not
a
statute
which
can
be
lead
--
read
literally
that
in
view
of
the
competing
and
contending
forces
that
when
into
it
so
construction
and
the
changes
that
were
made
on
the
floor,
etcetera,
etcetera
this
is
a
statute
that
has
to
be
approach
with
caution
as
to
it's
construction
and
that
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that’s
what
this
court
said
your
honor.
it
said
this
provision
said
labor
legislations
generally
and
this
statute
in
particular
cannot
be
read
literally
but
must
be
read
in
terms
of
the
purposes
which
congress
sought
to
serve
in
its
enactment
which
can
be
discerned
from
the
legislative
history.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
believe
it
was
the
laborers
case.
there
were
two
decided
on
the
same
day
laborers
and
glass
bottle
blowers
and
in
one
of
those
and
perhaps
in
both
the
court
made
the
statement
that
it
cannot
be
read
literally.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
has
your
honor.
indeed
it’s
glass
bottle
blowers
that
this
portion
is
quoted
in
page
32
of
our
brief.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
literal
reading
leads
to
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
i
mean
you
can
read
--
you
can
literally
read
this
to
mean
whatever
you
want
it
to
mean
and
i
think
that’s
why
this
assumption
about
how
one
can
construes
labor
legislation
began
was
that
you
can
read
things
to
reach
whatever
result
you
want.
if
you
read
the
senate
report
i
think
you
get
more
guidance
in
the
ambiguity
as
a
somewhat
resolve.
as
we
say
--
as
we
read
the
senate
report
this
--
the
exhaustion
requirement
was
intended
to
serve
four
functions.
number
one,
congress
didn’t
want
the
secretary
to
be
an
agent
at
large
bringing
lawsuits
wherever
he
thought
unions
weren’t
doing
things
right.
this
was
a
union
democracy
statute
as
mr.
wallace
said.
congress
wanted
to
allow
the
secretary
to
act
where
the
member
were
dissatisfied
with
the
way
their
union
was
being
run
and
if
the
members
are
not
dissatisfied
with
the
meeting-attendance
rule,
congress
didn’t
want
the
secretary
trampling
in
challenging
it
absent
their
consent.
now,
that
purpose
can’t
be
served
at
all
if
the
secretary
is
free
that
allege
anything
he
wants
to
allege
because
as
here
he
can
then
allege
things
as
to
which
there’s
no
indication
of
membership
dissatisfaction.
the
second
thing
congress
wanted
to
serve
by
this
is
that
it
wanted
to
instill
in
the
membership
respect
for
union
for
tribunals,
and
it
wanted
union
tribunals
to
function
as
administrative
agencies
notwithstanding
the
government’s
assertion
to
the
contrary.
this
court
said
that
it
was
congress’
emphatic
intention
that
unions
would
be
the
principal
enforcement
agencies
of
the
statute
and
so
congress
wanted
members
to
see
that
their
tribunals
would
indeed
be
available
for
the
resolution
of
these
problems.
now,
members
are
not
going
to
be
encouraged
to
take
their
disputes
to
the
union’s
tribunals
for
resolution
if
they
know
that
they
can
just
throw
any
old
thing
into
the
union
and
then
go
to
the
secretary
afterward
and
he’ll
take
it
whether
the
union
have
it
or
not.
and
indeed
when
unions
in
fact
they’re
behaving
in
a
responsible
fashion
as
indeed
the
steelworkers
is
in
resolving
election
disputes.
is
this
union
over
a
period
of
60
--
1964
through
1967?
it
provided
corrective
action
and
the
majority
of
the
election
complaints
that
came
before
it
and
so
it
was
doing
the
job
that
congress
hope
and
expected
unions
to
do.
but
if
the
members
see
that
the
union
tribunal
is
just
willfully
overruled
by
the
secretary
who
brings
the
lawsuits
then
i
cannot
be
convinced
that
this
union
is
doing
their
job
and
they’re
going
to
lose
their
motivation
to
bring
the
problems
to
the
union
for
correction.
now,
to
be
sure
if
the
union
has
fair
notice
of
a
problem
and
doesn’t
do
anything
about
it
then
it
deserves
to
disrepute
which
its
own
internal
proceedings
are
brought
to.
but
whereas
here
the
union
has
no
notice
whatsoever
that
an
issue
is
being
challenged
and
the
reason
it
has
no
such
notice
is
that
indeed
the
issue
is
not
being
challenged
by
any
of
its
member.
it
does
nothing
but
bring
the
union’s
tribunal
into
disrepute
for
the
membership
to
see
that
notwithstanding
without
the
union’s
action
the
secretary
of
labor
has
then
institute
a
lawsuit
to
set
that
election
aside.
and
finally,
this
statute
was
designed
with
very
specific
time
limits
in
mind
in
the
hopes
that
union
problems
would
be
corrected
very
promptly.
and
what
the
secretary’s
construction
means
is
that
particular
kinds
of
election
problems
can
be
raise
for
the
first
time.
many
months
in
this
case
it
was
four
to
five
months
after
the
elections
been
decided
and
long
after
all
of
the
union
internal
correction
procedures
had
been
exhausted.
the
senate
report
said
that
it
was
putting
the
time
limits
into
this
statute
because
time
as
of
the
essence
that’s
their
words.
time
sees
us
to
be
at
the
essence
when
five
months
later
the
secretary
as
a
result
of
it's
own
views
about
what’s
good
and
what’s
bad
in
union
can
raise
for
the
first
time
issues
which
were
never
raise
within
the
union.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we’re
ambivalent
about
that.
there’s
most
of
the
purposes
for
which
the
exhaustion
rule
was
designed
would
not
be
violated
by
allowing
the
secretary
to
get
what
amounted
to
a
declaratory
judgment
that
in
the
election
which
has
been
set
aside
for
another
reason.
this
thing
will
be
done
the
way
the
secretary
claims
it
must
be
done
under
the
statute.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
is
except
for
one
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
except
but
it’s
not
really
essential
and
i’ll
explain
why.
there
is
one
purpose
of
the
exhaustion
which
would
not
be
served
by
that
and
that’s
the
purpose
that
unless
the
membership
unhappy
things
are
not
to
be
changed
which
i
stated
was
the
first
of
the
purpose
isn’t
the
only
one
incidentally
that
the
secretary
acknowledges
in
the
brief.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that’s
right
but
the
act
also
says
that
unless
somebody
is
unhappy
with
that
election
you
are
going
to
carry
out
it's
not
subject
to
challenge
so
you
get
the
following
–
you
get
the
following
do
a
problem.
under
one
hand,
if
all
of
the
members
are
delighted
with
the
meeting-attendance
rule
take
the
extreme
case,
every
one
of
the
million
in
quarter
steelworkers
signs
a
thing
saying,
“i
think
this
is
a
great
rule.”
congress
quite
clearly
didn’t
want
the
secretary
to
be
able
to
get
that
rule
set
aside
even
though
it
might
be
technically
a
violation.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
this
court
concludes
that
irrespective
of
membership
satisfaction,
the
new
election
must
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
t
title
--
with
the
every
requirement
of
title
iv
even
though
the
members
might
refer
it
another
way,
then
we
would
have
no
problem
with
the
court
saying
that
the
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
this
issue
can
be
made
not
for
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
anything
because
of
that
adjudication
but
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
union
and
the
secretary
as
to
how
a
rerun
ordered
for
other
reasons
is
to
be
conducted.
and
indeed
we
told
that
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
recall
that
we
won
this
case
in
a
district
court
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
said
the
meeting-attendance
rule
is
reasonable.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
for
the
first
time
made
the
argument
while
even
if
we’re
not
allowed
to
challenge
the
election
on
this
ground,
we
ought
to
be
entitled
to
guidance
if
we’re
to
rerun
the
election
for
the
president
for
other
reasons.
we
ought
to
have
guidance
as
to
how
to
do
something
and
we
indicated
that
we
had
no
serious
objection
with
the
court
deciding
the
issue
for
that
limited
purpose
not
for
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
the
election
of
all
11
officers
which
is
what
the
secretary
seeks
initially,
but
for
the
purpose
simply
of
instructing
the
parties
on
how
to
rerun
is
to
be
conducted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
no,
there
is
disagreement
between
the
secretary
and
us
as
to
what
he
complained
about
to
the
secretary.
his
words
were
ambiguous.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
said
the
union
conducted
the
election
under
a
rule
which
was
unfair.
a
meeting-attendance
rule
which
was
unfair
i'm
characterizing
it
because
it
was
not
adequately
communicated
to
the
members.
now,
the
secretary
said
he
was
complaining
about
both
the
unfairness
of
the
rule
as
such
and
the
failure
to
communicate.
we
say
no
he
was
only
complaining
about
authority
to
communicate
the
rule
and
we
were
prepared
to
have
him
testify
and
expected
fully
that
he
would
testify
but
that
he
was
only
complaining.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh!
yes,
irrelevant
under
ours.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely!
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
it's
irrelevant
under
ours
but
there
is
at
least
a
possible
middle
ground
of
saying
that
he
can
sue
about
--
the
secretary
can
sue
about
what’s
raise
in
the
complaint.
the
secretary
has
sort
of
alluded
to
that
middle
ground
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
even
if
there
were
such
a
middle
ground
which
we
don’t
agree
with,
we
say
you
got
exhaust
it
in
the
union.
even
if
there
were
such
a
middle
ground
this
record
would
not
justify
allowing
and
to
sue
on
that.
now,
i’d
like
to
turn
on
my
remaining
few
moments
to
the
meeting-attendance
rule
and
it's
reasonableness
as
so.
the
secretary
repeatedly
talks
about
this
is
just
like
hotel
employees
this
is
a
case
were
a
rule
has
disqualified
or
has
rendered
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
union
ineligible
to
run
for
that.
the
single
thing
i
would
most
like
to
emphasize
is
that
this
rule
disqualified
nobody.
every
single
member
of
this
union
and
the
secretary
conceded
it
could
qualify
under
this
rule
and
could
qualify
without
difficulty.
all
you
had
to
do
was
attend
11
meetings
over
the
course
of
a
21-month
period.
the
secretary
of
labor
had
a
regulation
published.
it
is
still
publish
today.
expressly
stating
that
a
meeting-attendance
requirement
requiring
50%
attendance
at
the
meeting
is
over
a
two-year
period
is
a
reasonable
rule
unless
there
is
difficulty
in
attendance.
we
are
ironically
here
defending
the
post
--
the
secretary’s
publish
regulation.
he
ironically
is
here
attacking
it.
and
the
basis
of
his
attack
is
that
well
it's
true
that’s
what
my
regulation
says
but
from
time
to
time
i
change
my
mind
and
indeed
as
the
record
on
this
case
showed
he
changed
that
often.
on
the
question
whether
and
otherwise
reasonable
rule
should
be
set
aside
because
in
fact
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
member
choose
to
qualify
themselves
under
it
by
attending
the
meetings.
six
months
before
this
election
was
held,
the
secretary
stated
he
conducted
a
review
and
had
determined
that
the
small
percentage
should
not
invalidate
the
rule
precisely
because
anybody
could
attend
to
one
or
two
and
if
they
chose
not
too
that’s
their
own
choice.
after
we
held
our
election,
he
changed
his
mind
again
and
decided
to
sue
us.
so
we
got
caught
betwixt
and
between.
what
we
did
was
lawful
when
done
but
unlawful
when
the
secretary
change
his
mind
again.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh!
we
strongly
urge
you
to
pass
on
and
then
the
reason
urge
it
is
that
the
secretary
has
now
brought
lawsuits
against
15
steelworker
local
unions
challenging
this
identical
meeting-attendance
rule.
they’re
in
just
about
every
circuit
in
the
united
states
and
we
will
be
involved
in
endless
litigation
over
this
issue
which
will
undoubtedly
result
in
a
conflict
and
will
undoubtedly
get
back
here
anyway.
and
since
the
issue
is
before
the
court
at
this
time,
if
you
conclude
that
the
issue
was
properly
raised
then
therefore
before
you
we
strongly
urge
that
you
reach
it
and
decide
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
he
does.
i
think
he
does.
one
think
i’d
like
to
say
about
percentages
because
that’s
really
the
only
argument
that
the
secretary’s
got
here
only
a
small
percentage
in
fact
chose
to
qualify.
the
fact
is
that
of
the
27
people
who
sought
to
run
for
office
23
qualified
and
that
proves
a
rather
salient
fact
which
is
as
only
a
small
percentage
of
people
in
any
institution
who
want
to
run
for
office
and
if
those
who
do
given
reasonable
requirements
for
qualifying
the
best
majority
will
in
fact
qualify.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
honestly
don’t
recall.
there
is
one
other
with
the
three-year
rule
but
this
election
was
only
a
21-month
rule
because
it
was
a
new
local
union
so
that
the
court
need
not
in
this
case
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
three-year
rule
but
only
a
21-month
rule.
thank
you.
