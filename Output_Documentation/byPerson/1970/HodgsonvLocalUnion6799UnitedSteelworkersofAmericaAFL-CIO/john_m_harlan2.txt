the

can’t
go
to
the
secretary
until
after
he
as
a
member
has
exhausted
the

justice

independently
of
402,
as
i
understand
it
the
secretary
is
sua
sponte,
may
make
an
investigation
at
section
601?
justice
john
m.

and
then
he
does
the
same
things
virtually
that
the
union
member
who
is
complaining
of
something
does,
doesn’t
he?
in
which
he
sits
down
with
the
union
officials
to
see
if
they
will
not
themselves
do
something
about
it?

mr.
wallace
if
he
sets
aside
the
election
of
the
president
and
wants
to
order
a
new
election
he
can
certainly
conduct
the
election
in
accordance
with
the
law
without
setting
aside
the
election
for
their
officers.
and
even
if
he
was
right
about
being
able
to
litigate
the
meeting-attendance
rules
in
order
to
conduct
the
right
kind
of
an
election,
is
it
necessarily
to
follow
that
he
must
set
aside
the
election
of
officers
previously
elected
with
which
all
the
members
seem
to
be
satisfied?
justice

well,
that
may
be
true
but
as
i
understand
it
you
say
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
statute
was
to
cause
the
union
self-government
in
the
sense
that
the
secretary
can
intervene
in
an
election
and
all
the
members
happen
to
be
satisfied
with
it.

john
m.

the

how
it

it

the

of

permit
the

election
