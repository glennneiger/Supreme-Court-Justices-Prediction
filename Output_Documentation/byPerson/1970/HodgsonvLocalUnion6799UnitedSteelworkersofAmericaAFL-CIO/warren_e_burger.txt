mr.
wallace,
there

that

so
i
take
it,
your
theory
is
if
a
member
of
the
union
makes
a
complaint
about
one
particular
type
of
expenditure
which
he
considers
unlawful
and
improper
that
once
the
inquiry
is
made
by
the
secretary
he
can
pursue
every
instance
of
improper
expenditure
that
he
encounters?

mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
view
the
secretary’s
informal
efforts
at
adjustment
as
a
substitute
for
the
statutory
burden
of
the
member
to
exhaust
the
union
remedies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
suggestion
that
if
that
situation
occurred,
the
secretary
would
simply
be
able
to
say
to
the
union-member,
“now,
i
find
five
other
violations
that
you
didn’t
claim
about
and
i
can’t
do
anything
about
them
unless
you
exhaust
your
remedies
within
the
union,”
is
that
about
the
course
to
be
followed?

you’re

chief

which

in

line
and
“a

in

rather
it
adds
with
most
of
the
canons
of
