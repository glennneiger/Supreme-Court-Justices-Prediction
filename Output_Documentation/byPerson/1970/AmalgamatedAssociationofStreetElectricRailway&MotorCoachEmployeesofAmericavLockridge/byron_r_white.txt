r.
white
let’s
assume
that
all
he
asked
for
in
his
suit
was
restoration
of
his
membership
of
the
union,
that’s
his
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
sue
just
on
the
contract
basis
or
to
entertain
whatever
his
action
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
given
your
some
position
would
be
that
the
state
court
could
have
entertained
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
said
i
also
want
by
the
way
not
only
restoration,
but
i
would
like
some
damages
for
my
lost
wages
which
i
lost
because
i
didn’t
have
my
membership,
now
it’s
wrongfully
the
fact
--
that
act
let's
that
prayer
in
his
complaint,
is
he
awkward
right
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
says
i
was
wrongfully
terminated
from
membership
of
the
union
and
i
want
my
membership
back
and
i
want
damages
for
the
lost
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
give
the
same
answer
if
he
had
already
gone
to
the
general
counsel
and
filed
a
complaint
and
the
general
counsel
rejected
it,
and
then
he
said
well
i
must
get
a
hearing
some
place,
i’m
going
to
go
to
court.
you
would
say
you
couldn’t
go
to
court
then
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
(b)
had
alleged
discriminatory
conduct
amounting
to
what
he
alleged
was
a
breach
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
he
could
have
stayed
in
the
court?

yes.

mr.
groner,
what
the
--
i
suppose,
it’s
difficult
to
talk
abstractly,
but
let’s
assume
that
this
matter
had
gone
to
the
board
and
the
board
had
decided
that
there
was
no
unfairly
for
practice
here?
now,
is
your
position
that
therefore,
the
employee
would
have
no
remedy
against
the
union
under
his
contract
with
the
union
just
because
the
board
found
that
it
didn’t
amount

whatever
the
union
didn't
amount
to
an
unfair
labor
practice?
