mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
idaho,
preemption
is
the
issue.
whether
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
action
which
respondent
wilson
p.
lockridge
filed
against
petitioner
unions,
or
whether
the
state
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
because
congress
has
regulated
the
union
conduct
involved
in
this
case
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
for
some
years
prior
to
1959,
respondent
lockridge
was
an
interstate
bus
driver
employed
by
the
greyhound
bus
company.
pursuant
to
the
check-off
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
contracts
between
greyhound
and
the
petitioner
local
division,
lockridge
had
been
maintaining
his
union
dues
payments,
and
also,
his
employment
with
the
greyhound
in
as
much
as
the
collective-bargaining
agreements
provided
that
all
employees
shall
remain
members
as
a
condition
precedent
to
continued
employment.
the
union
constitution
provided
that
where
agreements
with
employing
companies
provide
that
members
must
be
in
continuous
good
financial
standing,
the
member
in
arrears
one
month
maybe
suspended
from
membership
and
removed
from
employment
in
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
in
august
1959,
lockridge
and
some
others
voluntarily
revoked
their
check-off
arrangements.
they
voluntarily
assumed
the
responsibility
of
maintaining
their
union
dues
payments
timely
to
maintain
their
membership
in
the
union
and
also
to
maintain
their
employment.
in
august
1959
and
also
in
october
1959,
the
union
in
writing
advised
the
--
lockridge
of
the
provisions
to
which
i
have
adverted
and
pointed
out
that
he
had
the
responsibility
to
maintain
these
payments.
nevertheless,
he
permitted
his
payments
to
become
delinquent
and
the
union
so
advised
greyhound,
and
in
november
1959,
being
delinquent
in
his
dues
for
the
month
of
october,
the
union
advised
greyhound
of
the
delinquency
and
greyhound
discharged
lockridge.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
union,
your
honor,
did
not
terminate
him.
the
union
advised
the
company
--
the
union
advised
the
company
on
november
2nd,
his
delinquency
having
arisen
on
november
1st.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
they
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
they
had
advised
him,
your
honor,
in
advanced
that
he
would
be
out
of
the
union
if
he
permitted
his
delinquency
to
be
in
arrears
more
than
one
month.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
he
was
delinquent
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
about
48
hours.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
after
having
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
record
indicates
two
things
with
respect
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
that
it
acted
uniformally
with
respect
to
everyone
who
had
been
given
these
notifications
and
were
in
this
precise
delinquency.
there
was
only
one
other
such
member,
an
employee
named
elmer
j.
day.
it
also
shows
as
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
union
had
suffered
delinquencies
--
had
permitted
other
people
who
were
in
arrears
a
comparable
length
of
time
to
remain
in
membership
and
to
remain
in
employment.
but
there
is
nothing
indicated
that
they
had
received
the
kind
of
notices
which
messrs
lockridge
and
day
had
received
here.
in
any
event,
lockridge
did
not
file
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
either
that
he
had
not
been
treated
like
others
in
the
same
situation
or
making
any
other
allegation
of
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
federal
act.
in
september
1960,
as
a
resident
of
idaho,
he
instituted
an
action
in
the
district
court
for
boise,
idaho
district
court
for
boise
against
petitioner
unions
and
originally
also
against
greyhound,
naming
greyhound
as
a
party
defendant
and
including
also
a
count
specifically
directed
to
the
just
cause
provision
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
alleging
that
greyhound
had
violated
that.
prior
to
any
judicial
action
on
the
original
complaint,
however,
lockridge
filed
an
amended
complaint
which
removed
greyhound
as
a
party
defendant
and
also
removed
the
particular
count
which
had
been
addressed
to
greyhound
in
its
action
under
the
collective-bargaining
contract.
basically
in
that
amended
complaint
there
were
in
essence
three
counts;
one,
tortuous
interference
with
employment;
two,
violation
of
the
contract
between
the
union
and
the
member
and
three,
conspiracy
all
purporting
to
be
stated
under
state
law.
the
union’s
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
including
among
other
things;
the
particular
ground
that
the
subject
matter
of
lockridge’s
action
was
preempted
by
virtue
of
its
regulation
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
district
judge
granted
that
motion,
relying
in
principle
part
upon
this
court’s
decision
in
the
garmon
case,
lockridge
appealed.
in
1962,
the
idaho
supreme
court
reversed
holding
that
it
was
confused
by
the
preemption
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
particular
purporting
to
see
confusion
between
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
gonzales
case
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
garmon
case.
the
case
was
remanded
for
trial.
prior
to
trial,
there
was
another
amendment
of
the
complaint.
in
all
of
these
complaints
and
of
course,
in
particular
in
the
second
amended
complaint
which
was
the
basis
for
the
trial,
all
that
lockridge
sought
was
money
damages.
at
no
time
did
he
request
the
relief
of
restoration
to
union
membership.
he
had
originally
sought
both
compensatory
damages
and
punitive
damages,
but
in
his
second
amended
complaint,
he
excised
the
count
which
was
addressed
to
punitive
damages
and
he
also
cut
out
the
prayer
of
a
request
for
punitive
damages.
in
a
preliminary
ruling
prior
to
trial,
the
idaho
district
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
the
documents
involved.
in
essence,
holding
that
the
contract
required
that
the
employee
remain
a
member,
whereas
the
constitution
required
that
members
must
be
in
good
or
the
constitution
referred
to
contracts
which
required
that
members
must
be
in
continuous
good
financial
standing
that
court
purporting
to
find
that
difference
unambiguous
and
declining
to
permit
the
unions
to
file
affidavits
both
from
their
officers
and
from
greyhound
representatives
which
stated
that
no
difference
was
intended
that
between
the
language
and
no
difference
was
intended
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
applicable
here
and
other
collective-bargaining
agreements
applicable
to
other
drivers
in
the
same
bargaining
unit
which
did
have
the
continuously
good
financial
standing
language.
the
trial
was
devoted
primarily
to
damages.
the
district
judge
in
idaho
held
again
that
he
believed
that
the
matter
was
preempted
and
that
the
union’
position
in
this
respect
had
been
strengthen
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
borden
and
in
perko.
the
1962
decision
of
the
idaho
supreme
court
was
rendered
prior
to
the
decision
of
this
court
--
decisions
of
this
court
in
borden
and
in
perko.
and
indeed,
the
idaho
supreme
court
in
1962
relied
upon
the
state
supreme
court
decisions
in
borden
and
in
perko
which
were
of
course
reversed
on
preemption
grounds
by
the
decisions
of
the
this
court.
the
idaho
district
judge
felt,
however,
that
he
was
mandated
to
proceed
by
the
idaho
supreme
court
decision,
and
he
awarded
damages
in
which
with
interest
approximate
$50,000.00.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
the
unions
on
the
ground
of
preemption.
the
decision
below
affirmed
by
a
vote
of
4
to
1
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
confining
themselves
to
the
issue
of
preemption,
and
indeed
almost
entirely
to
a
discussion
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
featuring
borden
and
perko.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
there’s
no
question
that
unions
in
general
have
a
duty
of
fairly
representing
all
those
in
the
bargaining
unit.
if
--
to
that
extent,
i
would
answer
your
question
in
the
affirmative
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no
sir.
no
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
in
this
case,
he
comported
himself
as
one
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
there
are
other
alternatives
your
honor
between
being
an
outright
adversary
and
responding
to
your
question
that
the
union
must
defend
him
in
every
way.
i
certainly
would
not
accept
the
proposition
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
so
broad.
at
least,
where
--
there
isn’t
presented
all
the
factual
reference
which
would
indicate
how
broad
you
would
like
to
extend
it.
with
respect
to
this
particular
case
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
question
is
directed
to
it,
the
duty
about
which
you
inquire
was
never
invoked
by
lockridge.
he
had
account
which
sought
punitive
damages
and
he
excised
that
and
even
in
that
count,
he
did
not
purport
to
rely
upon
any
duty
of
fair
representation
and
the
reason
for
that
mr.
chief
justice
in
our
view
is
quite
obvious.
he
wanted
no
part
of
any
federal
law.
he
wanted
no
part
of
any
action
that
could
possibly
be
thought
to
be
based
on
section
301,
so
as
to
give
rise
to
a
right
of
removal
in
the
unions;
a
right
of
removal
to
the
federal
district
court
which
would
be
acquainted
with
the
act
to
a
court
of
appeals
which
has
had
cases
under
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
are
directly
in
point.
the
fiduciary
duty
of
which
your
honor
maybe
thinking,
if
i
may
try
to
make
it
somewhat
more
precise,
the
duty
of
a
union
to
advise
the
member
when
he
is
delinquent
in
his
dues,
and
the
extent
to
which
he
is
delinquent
in
his
dues
is
a
duty
which
has
been
spelled
out
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
its
decisions
under
section
8
(b)
(2),
and
it
is
precisely
--
that
is
precisely
the
basis
or
one
of
the
basis
of
our
fundamental
position
that
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed
on
preemption
grounds
for
two
different
reasons.
one
is
that
congress
has
occupied
the
field
of
this
union
activity.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
that
was
all
he
asked
for
in
the
suit
and
if
all
the
other
circumstances
indicated
that
the
crux
of
the
action
was
the
membership
relationship
rather
than
the
employment
relationship,
then
the
state
courts
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
it.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no
your
honor,
no.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
oh
yes
and
could
have
granted
the
relief
of
restoration
to
union
membership.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
--
that
i
can
answer
your
question
directly
mr.
justice
white
because
it
would
depend
upon
many
other
factors.
it
depends
as
this
court’s
talked
in
borden
and
perko,
upon
decision
as
to
what
the
crux
of
the
action
is,
and
that
would
depend
upon
what
he
sought
in
his
action,
what
he
said
in
his
complaint
as
well
perhaps
upon
other
things.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
damages
for
lost
wages,
where
the
wages
of
course
would
relate
to
employment,
a
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
grant.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
under
any
circumstances,
yes
your
honor.
the
only
issue
would
be
whether
the
state
court
would
have
any
jurisdiction
in
the
premises
if
in
the
initial
analysis
to
conclusion
were
reached,
as
it
must
be
in
this
case
in
our
view,
that
the
nub
of
the
action
is
the
employment
relationship,
then,
the
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
but
in
any
event,
its
jurisdiction
would
be
limited
to
granting
relief
under
the
--
under
that
part
of
the
action
which
did
not
impinge
upon
federal
law,
that
part
of
the
relief
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
not
get.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes
your
honor.
i
will
say
that
he
could
not
and
that
is
this
court
has
made
clear
in
its
decisions
that
the
action
or
inaction
of
the
board
is
--
does
not
provide
an
exception
to
preemption
principles.
in
this
case
of
course,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
he
did
not
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
also
your
honor,
there
must
be
an
assumption
of
regularity
with
respect
to
the
general
counsel.
the
general
counsel
purportedly
would
issue
--
presumably
would
issue
a
complaint
if
the
facts
which
he
submitted
would
indicate
that
there
have
been
a
violation
of
the
act.
and
under
the
facts
as
he
states,
there
would
have
been
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(2)
and
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
he
had
done
so?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
he
had
done
so,
yes.
he
could
have
stayed
in
court,
but
he
couldn’t
not
have
stayed
in
the
state
court
because
that
would
have
given
rise
to
our
right
to
remove
and
our
right
to
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
in
our
view
that
would
have
led
to
a
far
different
consideration
of
the
case,
and
it
would
have
led
to
a
far
different
result.
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
--
these
state
courts
are
not
acquainted
with
labor
cases,
have
had
not
no
experience
with
the
labor
relations
act
that
we
find
ourselves
as
petitioners
here
in
our
view.
but
in
any
event,
he
did
not
do
that,
and
this
was
a
deliberate
election.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no.
he
originally
asked
for
it,
but
then
withdrew
it,
and
i
cite
that
partly
by
way
of
the
history
of
the
case,
but
also
by
way
of
lending
some
color
to
what
we
say
is
a
deliberate
election,
not
to
allege
any
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
there
is
no
such
issue
in
the
case.
he
did
not
allege
it.
indeed,
he
did
not
ask
for
punitive
damages.
the
district
court
found
that
petitioners
acted
out
of
an
honest
interpretation
of
what
their
legal
rights
were
and
the
court
below
also
found
that
this
was
an
honest
misunderstanding
with
respect
to
the
legal
documents
involved
and
had
been
no
discrimination
mr.
justice
white
in
the
invidious
sense
of
deliberately
in
individual
matter.
under
the
findings
here,
the
union’s
acted
in
good
faith,
but
the
issue
of
good
faith
was
never
fairly
litigated
because
he
never
alleged
it
and
it
was
never
tried.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
he
would
was.
the
lockridge
was
discharged
in
november
2,
1959,
so
that
by
the
time
--
and
then
the
case
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
is
the
back
pay,
yes.
but
the
back
pay
would
not
have
been
in
such
a
large
amount
because
he
would
have
to
file
his
charge
within
six
months
and
presumably
the
board
however
slowly,
it
may
grant
in
some
cases
would
have
dispose
of
this
case
prior
to
the
11
years
which
was
elapse
on
its
way
to
this
court?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
don’t
see
how
that
could
have
been
done.
we
could
have
removed
mr.
chief
justice
only
if
the
plaintiff
had
stated
a
complaint
under
federal
law.
the
plaintiff
is
in-charge
of
the
claim
he
states.
if
he
had
stated
a
claim
--
only
if
he
had
stated
a
claim
under
federal
law,
could
we
have
removed.
if
he
had
stated
a
claim
under
federal
law,
it
would
have
been
decided
under
federal
law.
it
presumably
would
have
been
a
section
301
claim,
and
the
federal
law
with
respect
to
that
is
under
many
decisions
of
this
court,
law
that
the
judges
pronounce
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
which
is
made
pursuant
to
section
301.
it
is
not
based
in
any
part
upon
the
law
of
equity
of
a
particular
state.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
in
some
other
--
i’m
sorry?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
is
con
--
in
any
lawsuit
your
honor,
no.
in
some
lawsuits
for
some
purposes,
the
considerations
which
you
advert
to
would
be
most
relevant
and
indeed,
decisive.
in
this
lawsuit,
under
the
allegations
made
in
the
complaint,
under
the
meets
and
bounds
of
the
cases
drawn
in
the
complaint
in
the
trial
and
in
the
consideration
by
all
parties
and
both
courts,
there
is
no
room
for
such
considerations.
in
any
event
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
been
discussing
matters
which
are
related
more
to
the
merits
and
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
in
our
view,
all
that
we
have
here
is
an
issue
of
a
jurisdiction
as
to
whether
the
state
courts
could
exercise
any
jurisdiction
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
particular
borden
and
perko,
and
under
the
prescriptions
of
the
congress
which
in
section
8
(b)
(2)
and
(7)
and
some
of
the
others
have
covered
all
cases
involving
union
conduct
of
requesting
or
obtaining
an
employee’s
discharge
by
advising
the
employer
that
he
has
been
delinquent
in
his
dues.
congress
has
made
all
such
activity,
either
protected
or
concerted.
and
therefore,
congress
is
occupied
the
field
and
therefore,
congress
--
and
therefore,
what
the
union
conduct
involved
here
is
arguably
either
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
protected
activity,
and
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
don’t’
know
as
it
would
--
as
it
would
be
therefore.
but
with
respect
to
the
union
conduct
directed
to
his
employment
relationship,
yes,
there
would
be
no
remedy.
congress
has
carved
this
out
and
put
it
beyond
the
state
--
the
state
domain.
now,
had
he
brought
a
suit
solely
to
restore
his
union
membership;
that
would
have
been
a
different
matter
if
the
crux
of
that
action
had
been
the
membership
relationship
rather
than
the
employment
relationship.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
under
borden
and
perko
your
honor
as
we
understand
it,
the
text
--
the
test
is
what
the
crux
of
the
action
is,
and
if
the
crux
of
the
action
is
the
employment
relationship,
yes,
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
if
it
solely
and
exclusively
membership
of
the
union,
that
would
be
a
matter
over
which
the
state
court
could
exercise
jurisdiction,
if
it
involved
the
membership
relationship.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
does
not
your
honor
because
with
respect
to
the
employment
aspects
of
it,
congress
has
litigated
and
in
the
congressional
litigation,
congress
covered
all
such
cases,
and
in
covering
all
such
cases,
congress
provided
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
shall
be
the
determining
law
and
provided
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
shall
be
the
tribunal.
these
cases
are
routinely
handled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
there
are
many
cases
of
alleged
violation
of
sections
8
(b)
(2)
and
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
this
is
the
way
cases
like
this
are
handled.
the
only
one
other
than
this
of
which
we
are
aware
is
the
day
case
where
the
oregon
supreme
court
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
preemption,
and
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
balance
i
have
and
perhaps
even
to
request
a
minute
or
two
more
for
rebuttal.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
it
would
for
a
reason
that
i’ll
come
to,
but
we
have
alternative
positions.
we
say
yes,
it
covers
the
whole
judgment,
but
if
it
does
not
cover
the
whole
judgment,
it
leaves
only
that
and
strikes
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
that
was
all
there
was
to
it,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
when
you
have
a
claim
which
involves
the
employment
relationship
and
presumably,
when
you
mentioned
the
word
damages,
you
are
i
assume
referring
to
damages
measured
by
wages.
if
they’re
measured
by
something
else
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
this
is
damages
measured
in
this
case,
measured
directly
by
wages
without
any
question.
yes,
then
the
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
award
that
and
we
say
your
honor
that
the
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
in
this
case
because
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
borden
and
perko
and
under
the
ruling
of
garmon
that
the
fundamental
thrust,
the
question
at
the
outset
is
whether
the
crux
of
the
case
involves
the
employment
relationship
or
the
membership
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
because
it
is
not
a
question
of
state
law
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
a
question
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
beyond
any
question.
mr.
kilcullen
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
he
cannot
advise
the
court
that
he
deliberately
took
out
the
breach
of
contract
point
because
he
knew
that
was
the
law
was
at
that
time
and
then
come
here
today
and
say
oh,
there
was
breach
of
contract
in
it.
he
took
it
out
and
took
it
out
deliberately.
he
wanted
to
focus
on
state
law.
he
wanted
to
focus
on
state
law
because
he
knew
and
has
known
all
the
time
that
he
can
come
away
with
a
judgment
in
this
case
of
any
kind
only
if
this
court
turns
its
back
on
borden
and
perko,
only
if
this
court
disregards
the
regulation
of
this
very
union
conduct,
every
type
of
union
conduct
which
involves
requesting
a
discharge
under
a
union
security
clause.
he’s
known
that
all
the
time
and
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
because
congress
has
occupied
the
field
and
because
this
certainly
and
not
arguably
is
either
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
protected
activity.
the
judgment
in
its
entirety
should
be
reversed,
but
if
it
is
not
to
be
reversed
for
whatever
reason
in
its
entirety,
only
the
portion
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
refer
to
and
maybe
left
standing
and
the
aspect
of
damages
which
in
this
case
beyond
any
doubt
is
based
upon
employment
must
be
stricken.
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
idaho,
preemption
is
the
issue.
whether
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
action
which
respondent
wilson
p.
lockridge
filed
against
petitioner
unions,
or
whether
the
state
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
because
congress
has
regulated
the
union
conduct
involved
in
this
case
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
for
some
years
prior
to
1959,
respondent
lockridge
was
an
interstate
bus
driver
employed
by
the
greyhound
bus
company.
pursuant
to
the
check-off
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
contracts
between
greyhound
and
the
petitioner
local
division,
lockridge
had
been
maintaining
his
union
dues
payments,
and
also,
his
employment
with
the
greyhound
in
as
much
as
the
collective-bargaining
agreements
provided
that
all
employees
shall
remain
members
as
a
condition
precedent
to
continued
employment.
the
union
constitution
provided
that
where
agreements
with
employing
companies
provide
that
members
must
be
in
continuous
good
financial
standing,
the
member
in
arrears
one
month
maybe
suspended
from
membership
and
removed
from
employment
in
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
in
august
1959,
lockridge
and
some
others
voluntarily
revoked
their
check-off
arrangements.
they
voluntarily
assumed
the
responsibility
of
maintaining
their
union
dues
payments
timely
to
maintain
their
membership
in
the
union
and
also
to
maintain
their
employment.
in
august
1959
and
also
in
october
1959,
the
union
in
writing
advised
the
--
lockridge
of
the
provisions
to
which
i
have
adverted
and
pointed
out
that
he
had
the
responsibility
to
maintain
these
payments.
nevertheless,
he
permitted
his
payments
to
become
delinquent
and
the
union
so
advised
greyhound,
and
in
november
1959,
being
delinquent
in
his
dues
for
the
month
of
october,
the
union
advised
greyhound
of
the
delinquency
and
greyhound
discharged
lockridge.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
union,
your
honor,
did
not
terminate
him.
the
union
advised
the
company
--
the
union
advised
the
company
on
november
2nd,
his
delinquency
having
arisen
on
november
1st.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
they
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
they
had
advised
him,
your
honor,
in
advanced
that
he
would
be
out
of
the
union
if
he
permitted
his
delinquency
to
be
in
arrears
more
than
one
month.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
he
was
delinquent
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
about
48
hours.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
after
having
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
record
indicates
two
things
with
respect
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
that
it
acted
uniformally
with
respect
to
everyone
who
had
been
given
these
notifications
and
were
in
this
precise
delinquency.
there
was
only
one
other
such
member,
an
employee
named
elmer
j.
day.
it
also
shows
as
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
union
had
suffered
delinquencies
--
had
permitted
other
people
who
were
in
arrears
a
comparable
length
of
time
to
remain
in
membership
and
to
remain
in
employment.
but
there
is
nothing
indicated
that
they
had
received
the
kind
of
notices
which
messrs
lockridge
and
day
had
received
here.
in
any
event,
lockridge
did
not
file
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
either
that
he
had
not
been
treated
like
others
in
the
same
situation
or
making
any
other
allegation
of
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
federal
act.
in
september
1960,
as
a
resident
of
idaho,
he
instituted
an
action
in
the
district
court
for
boise,
idaho
district
court
for
boise
against
petitioner
unions
and
originally
also
against
greyhound,
naming
greyhound
as
a
party
defendant
and
including
also
a
count
specifically
directed
to
the
just
cause
provision
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
alleging
that
greyhound
had
violated
that.
prior
to
any
judicial
action
on
the
original
complaint,
however,
lockridge
filed
an
amended
complaint
which
removed
greyhound
as
a
party
defendant
and
also
removed
the
particular
count
which
had
been
addressed
to
greyhound
in
its
action
under
the
collective-bargaining
contract.
basically
in
that
amended
complaint
there
were
in
essence
three
counts;
one,
tortuous
interference
with
employment;
two,
violation
of
the
contract
between
the
union
and
the
member
and
three,
conspiracy
all
purporting
to
be
stated
under
state
law.
the
union’s
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
including
among
other
things;
the
particular
ground
that
the
subject
matter
of
lockridge’s
action
was
preempted
by
virtue
of
its
regulation
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
district
judge
granted
that
motion,
relying
in
principle
part
upon
this
court’s
decision
in
the
garmon
case,
lockridge
appealed.
in
1962,
the
idaho
supreme
court
reversed
holding
that
it
was
confused
by
the
preemption
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
particular
purporting
to
see
confusion
between
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
gonzales
case
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
garmon
case.
the
case
was
remanded
for
trial.
prior
to
trial,
there
was
another
amendment
of
the
complaint.
in
all
of
these
complaints
and
of
course,
in
particular
in
the
second
amended
complaint
which
was
the
basis
for
the
trial,
all
that
lockridge
sought
was
money
damages.
at
no
time
did
he
request
the
relief
of
restoration
to
union
membership.
he
had
originally
sought
both
compensatory
damages
and
punitive
damages,
but
in
his
second
amended
complaint,
he
excised
the
count
which
was
addressed
to
punitive
damages
and
he
also
cut
out
the
prayer
of
a
request
for
punitive
damages.
in
a
preliminary
ruling
prior
to
trial,
the
idaho
district
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
the
documents
involved.
in
essence,
holding
that
the
contract
required
that
the
employee
remain
a
member,
whereas
the
constitution
required
that
members
must
be
in
good
or
the
constitution
referred
to
contracts
which
required
that
members
must
be
in
continuous
good
financial
standing
that
court
purporting
to
find
that
difference
unambiguous
and
declining
to
permit
the
unions
to
file
affidavits
both
from
their
officers
and
from
greyhound
representatives
which
stated
that
no
difference
was
intended
that
between
the
language
and
no
difference
was
intended
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
applicable
here
and
other
collective-bargaining
agreements
applicable
to
other
drivers
in
the
same
bargaining
unit
which
did
have
the
continuously
good
financial
standing
language.
the
trial
was
devoted
primarily
to
damages.
the
district
judge
in
idaho
held
again
that
he
believed
that
the
matter
was
preempted
and
that
the
union’
position
in
this
respect
had
been
strengthen
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
borden
and
in
perko.
the
1962
decision
of
the
idaho
supreme
court
was
rendered
prior
to
the
decision
of
this
court
--
decisions
of
this
court
in
borden
and
in
perko.
and
indeed,
the
idaho
supreme
court
in
1962
relied
upon
the
state
supreme
court
decisions
in
borden
and
in
perko
which
were
of
course
reversed
on
preemption
grounds
by
the
decisions
of
the
this
court.
the
idaho
district
judge
felt,
however,
that
he
was
mandated
to
proceed
by
the
idaho
supreme
court
decision,
and
he
awarded
damages
in
which
with
interest
approximate
$50,000.00.
an
appeal
was
taken
by
the
unions
on
the
ground
of
preemption.
the
decision
below
affirmed
by
a
vote
of
4
to
1
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
confining
themselves
to
the
issue
of
preemption,
and
indeed
almost
entirely
to
a
discussion
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
featuring
borden
and
perko.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
there’s
no
question
that
unions
in
general
have
a
duty
of
fairly
representing
all
those
in
the
bargaining
unit.
if
--
to
that
extent,
i
would
answer
your
question
in
the
affirmative
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no
sir.
no
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
in
this
case,
he
comported
himself
as
one
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
there
are
other
alternatives
your
honor
between
being
an
outright
adversary
and
responding
to
your
question
that
the
union
must
defend
him
in
every
way.
i
certainly
would
not
accept
the
proposition
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
so
broad.
at
least,
where
--
there
isn’t
presented
all
the
factual
reference
which
would
indicate
how
broad
you
would
like
to
extend
it.
with
respect
to
this
particular
case
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
question
is
directed
to
it,
the
duty
about
which
you
inquire
was
never
invoked
by
lockridge.
he
had
account
which
sought
punitive
damages
and
he
excised
that
and
even
in
that
count,
he
did
not
purport
to
rely
upon
any
duty
of
fair
representation
and
the
reason
for
that
mr.
chief
justice
in
our
view
is
quite
obvious.
he
wanted
no
part
of
any
federal
law.
he
wanted
no
part
of
any
action
that
could
possibly
be
thought
to
be
based
on
section
301,
so
as
to
give
rise
to
a
right
of
removal
in
the
unions;
a
right
of
removal
to
the
federal
district
court
which
would
be
acquainted
with
the
act
to
a
court
of
appeals
which
has
had
cases
under
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
are
directly
in
point.
the
fiduciary
duty
of
which
your
honor
maybe
thinking,
if
i
may
try
to
make
it
somewhat
more
precise,
the
duty
of
a
union
to
advise
the
member
when
he
is
delinquent
in
his
dues,
and
the
extent
to
which
he
is
delinquent
in
his
dues
is
a
duty
which
has
been
spelled
out
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
its
decisions
under
section
8
(b)
(2),
and
it
is
precisely
--
that
is
precisely
the
basis
or
one
of
the
basis
of
our
fundamental
position
that
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed
on
preemption
grounds
for
two
different
reasons.
one
is
that
congress
has
occupied
the
field
of
this
union
activity.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
that
was
all
he
asked
for
in
the
suit
and
if
all
the
other
circumstances
indicated
that
the
crux
of
the
action
was
the
membership
relationship
rather
than
the
employment
relationship,
then
the
state
courts
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
it.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no
your
honor,
no.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
oh
yes
and
could
have
granted
the
relief
of
restoration
to
union
membership.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
--
that
i
can
answer
your
question
directly
mr.
justice
white
because
it
would
depend
upon
many
other
factors.
it
depends
as
this
court’s
talked
in
borden
and
perko,
upon
decision
as
to
what
the
crux
of
the
action
is,
and
that
would
depend
upon
what
he
sought
in
his
action,
what
he
said
in
his
complaint
as
well
perhaps
upon
other
things.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
damages
for
lost
wages,
where
the
wages
of
course
would
relate
to
employment,
a
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
grant.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
under
any
circumstances,
yes
your
honor.
the
only
issue
would
be
whether
the
state
court
would
have
any
jurisdiction
in
the
premises
if
in
the
initial
analysis
to
conclusion
were
reached,
as
it
must
be
in
this
case
in
our
view,
that
the
nub
of
the
action
is
the
employment
relationship,
then,
the
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
but
in
any
event,
its
jurisdiction
would
be
limited
to
granting
relief
under
the
--
under
that
part
of
the
action
which
did
not
impinge
upon
federal
law,
that
part
of
the
relief
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
not
get.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes
your
honor.
i
will
say
that
he
could
not
and
that
is
this
court
has
made
clear
in
its
decisions
that
the
action
or
inaction
of
the
board
is
--
does
not
provide
an
exception
to
preemption
principles.
in
this
case
of
course,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
he
did
not
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
also
your
honor,
there
must
be
an
assumption
of
regularity
with
respect
to
the
general
counsel.
the
general
counsel
purportedly
would
issue
--
presumably
would
issue
a
complaint
if
the
facts
which
he
submitted
would
indicate
that
there
have
been
a
violation
of
the
act.
and
under
the
facts
as
he
states,
there
would
have
been
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(2)
and
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
he
had
done
so?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
he
had
done
so,
yes.
he
could
have
stayed
in
court,
but
he
couldn’t
not
have
stayed
in
the
state
court
because
that
would
have
given
rise
to
our
right
to
remove
and
our
right
to
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
in
our
view
that
would
have
led
to
a
far
different
consideration
of
the
case,
and
it
would
have
led
to
a
far
different
result.
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
--
these
state
courts
are
not
acquainted
with
labor
cases,
have
had
not
no
experience
with
the
labor
relations
act
that
we
find
ourselves
as
petitioners
here
in
our
view.
but
in
any
event,
he
did
not
do
that,
and
this
was
a
deliberate
election.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no.
he
originally
asked
for
it,
but
then
withdrew
it,
and
i
cite
that
partly
by
way
of
the
history
of
the
case,
but
also
by
way
of
lending
some
color
to
what
we
say
is
a
deliberate
election,
not
to
allege
any
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
there
is
no
such
issue
in
the
case.
he
did
not
allege
it.
indeed,
he
did
not
ask
for
punitive
damages.
the
district
court
found
that
petitioners
acted
out
of
an
honest
interpretation
of
what
their
legal
rights
were
and
the
court
below
also
found
that
this
was
an
honest
misunderstanding
with
respect
to
the
legal
documents
involved
and
had
been
no
discrimination
mr.
justice
white
in
the
invidious
sense
of
deliberately
in
individual
matter.
under
the
findings
here,
the
union’s
acted
in
good
faith,
but
the
issue
of
good
faith
was
never
fairly
litigated
because
he
never
alleged
it
and
it
was
never
tried.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
he
would
was.
the
lockridge
was
discharged
in
november
2,
1959,
so
that
by
the
time
--
and
then
the
case
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
is
the
back
pay,
yes.
but
the
back
pay
would
not
have
been
in
such
a
large
amount
because
he
would
have
to
file
his
charge
within
six
months
and
presumably
the
board
however
slowly,
it
may
grant
in
some
cases
would
have
dispose
of
this
case
prior
to
the
11
years
which
was
elapse
on
its
way
to
this
court?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
don’t
see
how
that
could
have
been
done.
we
could
have
removed
mr.
chief
justice
only
if
the
plaintiff
had
stated
a
complaint
under
federal
law.
the
plaintiff
is
in-charge
of
the
claim
he
states.
if
he
had
stated
a
claim
--
only
if
he
had
stated
a
claim
under
federal
law,
could
we
have
removed.
if
he
had
stated
a
claim
under
federal
law,
it
would
have
been
decided
under
federal
law.
it
presumably
would
have
been
a
section
301
claim,
and
the
federal
law
with
respect
to
that
is
under
many
decisions
of
this
court,
law
that
the
judges
pronounce
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
which
is
made
pursuant
to
section
301.
it
is
not
based
in
any
part
upon
the
law
of
equity
of
a
particular
state.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
in
some
other
--
i’m
sorry?
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
is
con
--
in
any
lawsuit
your
honor,
no.
in
some
lawsuits
for
some
purposes,
the
considerations
which
you
advert
to
would
be
most
relevant
and
indeed,
decisive.
in
this
lawsuit,
under
the
allegations
made
in
the
complaint,
under
the
meets
and
bounds
of
the
cases
drawn
in
the
complaint
in
the
trial
and
in
the
consideration
by
all
parties
and
both
courts,
there
is
no
room
for
such
considerations.
in
any
event
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
been
discussing
matters
which
are
related
more
to
the
merits
and
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
in
our
view,
all
that
we
have
here
is
an
issue
of
a
jurisdiction
as
to
whether
the
state
courts
could
exercise
any
jurisdiction
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
particular
borden
and
perko,
and
under
the
prescriptions
of
the
congress
which
in
section
8
(b)
(2)
and
(7)
and
some
of
the
others
have
covered
all
cases
involving
union
conduct
of
requesting
or
obtaining
an
employee’s
discharge
by
advising
the
employer
that
he
has
been
delinquent
in
his
dues.
congress
has
made
all
such
activity,
either
protected
or
concerted.
and
therefore,
congress
is
occupied
the
field
and
therefore,
congress
--
and
therefore,
what
the
union
conduct
involved
here
is
arguably
either
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
protected
activity,
and
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
i
don’t’
know
as
it
would
--
as
it
would
be
therefore.
but
with
respect
to
the
union
conduct
directed
to
his
employment
relationship,
yes,
there
would
be
no
remedy.
congress
has
carved
this
out
and
put
it
beyond
the
state
--
the
state
domain.
now,
had
he
brought
a
suit
solely
to
restore
his
union
membership;
that
would
have
been
a
different
matter
if
the
crux
of
that
action
had
been
the
membership
relationship
rather
than
the
employment
relationship.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
under
borden
and
perko
your
honor
as
we
understand
it,
the
text
--
the
test
is
what
the
crux
of
the
action
is,
and
if
the
crux
of
the
action
is
the
employment
relationship,
yes,
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
your
honor.
if
it
solely
and
exclusively
membership
of
the
union,
that
would
be
a
matter
over
which
the
state
court
could
exercise
jurisdiction,
if
it
involved
the
membership
relationship.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
it
does
not
your
honor
because
with
respect
to
the
employment
aspects
of
it,
congress
has
litigated
and
in
the
congressional
litigation,
congress
covered
all
such
cases,
and
in
covering
all
such
cases,
congress
provided
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
shall
be
the
determining
law
and
provided
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
shall
be
the
tribunal.
these
cases
are
routinely
handled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
there
are
many
cases
of
alleged
violation
of
sections
8
(b)
(2)
and
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
this
is
the
way
cases
like
this
are
handled.
the
only
one
other
than
this
of
which
we
are
aware
is
the
day
case
where
the
oregon
supreme
court
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
preemption,
and
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
balance
i
have
and
perhaps
even
to
request
a
minute
or
two
more
for
rebuttal.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
it
would
for
a
reason
that
i’ll
come
to,
but
we
have
alternative
positions.
we
say
yes,
it
covers
the
whole
judgment,
but
if
it
does
not
cover
the
whole
judgment,
it
leaves
only
that
and
strikes
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
if
that
was
all
there
was
to
it,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
when
you
have
a
claim
which
involves
the
employment
relationship
and
presumably,
when
you
mentioned
the
word
damages,
you
are
i
assume
referring
to
damages
measured
by
wages.
if
they’re
measured
by
something
else
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
this
is
damages
measured
in
this
case,
measured
directly
by
wages
without
any
question.
yes,
then
the
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
award
that
and
we
say
your
honor
that
the
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
in
this
case
because
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
borden
and
perko
and
under
the
ruling
of
garmon
that
the
fundamental
thrust,
the
question
at
the
outset
is
whether
the
crux
of
the
case
involves
the
employment
relationship
or
the
membership
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
because
it
is
not
a
question
of
state
law
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
a
question
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
beyond
any
question.
mr.
kilcullen
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
he
cannot
advise
the
court
that
he
deliberately
took
out
the
breach
of
contract
point
because
he
knew
that
was
the
law
was
at
that
time
and
then
come
here
today
and
say
oh,
there
was
breach
of
contract
in
it.
he
took
it
out
and
took
it
out
deliberately.
he
wanted
to
focus
on
state
law.
he
wanted
to
focus
on
state
law
because
he
knew
and
has
known
all
the
time
that
he
can
come
away
with
a
judgment
in
this
case
of
any
kind
only
if
this
court
turns
its
back
on
borden
and
perko,
only
if
this
court
disregards
the
regulation
of
this
very
union
conduct,
every
type
of
union
conduct
which
involves
requesting
a
discharge
under
a
union
security
clause.
he’s
known
that
all
the
time
and
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
because
congress
has
occupied
the
field
and
because
this
certainly
and
not
arguably
is
either
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
protected
activity.
the
judgment
in
its
entirety
should
be
reversed,
but
if
it
is
not
to
be
reversed
for
whatever
reason
in
its
entirety,
only
the
portion
mr.
justice
brennan
that
you
refer
to
and
maybe
left
standing
and
the
aspect
of
damages
which
in
this
case
beyond
any
doubt
is
based
upon
employment
must
be
stricken.
are
there
any
other
questions?
