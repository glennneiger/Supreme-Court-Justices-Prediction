mr.

my
i
ask
you
a
question
here,
a
general
question?
do
you
accept
the
idea
that’s
been
expressed
by
several
courts

i’m
not
sure
it’s
ever
been
articulated
here,
that
a
union
in

to
its
members
is
a
trusty,
a
fiduciary,
has
all
the
duties
of
a
fiduciary

i
put
it
little
further.
you

to
the
point
of
protecting
him
and
aiding

48

on

he
becomes
an
adversary

chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
groner,
assume
that
it
had
moved
over

federal
court

your
efforts.
would
the

do
you

the

is
it
controlled
exclusively

chief

you

be
within
the
jurisdiction
of

state
court
and
not
subject
to
preemption?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
if
it’s
membership
in

is
that
exclusively
federal
in
your
view?
chief

warren
e.
burger
and
why
doesn’t
the
--
to
pursue
justice
white’s
point,
why
doesn’t
the

of

the
employment
fall
in
the

slot?
