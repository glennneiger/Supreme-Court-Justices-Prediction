mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
there’s
no
question
that
respondent
lockridge
here
sustained
a
substantial
injury.
he
has
had
his
case
in
court
now
for
more
than
10
years.
he
was
out
of
work
entirely
for
almost
four
years
of
those
10
years.
in
order
to
find
another
job,
he
had
to
move
to
a
different
part
of
the
state
and
take
a
job
at
a
much
lower
rate
of
pay
than
he
had
been
earning
with
greyhound.
not
only
has
his
earning
level
been
reduced,
he
has
also
lost
all
of
the
benefits,
retirement,
medical
coverage,
burial
benefits
and
other
rights,
he
would
have
enjoyed
if
he
had
not
been
unlawfully
suspended
from
union
membership.
this
was
all
because
he
was
two
days
late
in
paying
$6.50
in
union
dues.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
under
the
--
but
the
union’s
right
to
suspend
him
from
membership
was
exe
--
or
the
union
suspension
of
him
from
membership
was
taken
on
the
basis
that
he
was
two
days
past
the
30
days
allowed
under
their
contention.
actually,
the
union
constitution
said
that
a
man
may
not
be
suspended
from
membership
unless
he
is
delinquent
from
dues,
unless
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
his
dues
are
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
his
dues
are
in
arrears,
and
where
a
member
allows
his
arrears
and
dues
finds
some
assessments
to
run
into
the
second
month
before
paying
the
same
shall
be
barred
from
benefit.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that
would
be
november
30th,
yes
sir.
if
lockridge
is
denied
a
remedy
for
these
--
for
the
wrongs
he
has
sustained,
there
will
be
a
grave
in
justice.
he
is
a
man
of
limited
education.
without
qualifications
to
do
much
else
and
drive
a
bus
and
he
is
a
physical
disability
which
limits
his
employment
opportunities.
now,
the
union
argues
that
the
remedy
given
him
by
the
state
court
cannot
stand
because
he
filed
the
wrong
form
of
pleading.
they
say
that
if
he
filed
a
complaint
asking
only
for
restoration
of
his
union
membership,
the
case
would
have
been
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
as
an
internal
union
matter.
his
mistake
they
say
was
that
he
asked
for
damages
for
loss
of
his
employment,
and
that
this
changed
the
whole
focus
of
this
case
to
one
for
interference
with
his
employment
relationship.
the
union
does
seeks
to
make
the
question
of
jurisdiction
turn
on
the
form
of
the
pleadings
rather
than
on
the
substance.
this
of
course
would
take
us
back
to
the
old
common
law
--
rules
of
common
law
pleading
with
all
the
hair
splitting
distinctions
between
different
forms
of
action,
whereas
under
current
practice,
it’s
the
substance
accounts
rather
than
the
form.
the
critical
act
which
gave
rise
to
this
case
was
the
suspension
of
respondent’s
membership
in
the
union.
the
loss
of
his
job
and
loss
of
his
income
was
a
result
of
that
act.
the
suit
which
he
brought
in
the
idaho
court
was
predicated
on
that
act.
the
money
damages
he
claimed
were
simply
the
measure
of
the
injury
he
sustained
because
of
that
act.
for
purposes
of
comparison,
let
us
take
a
situation
in
which
an
individual
is
unlawfully
arrested
and
detained
in
jail
and
as
a
consequence,
he
looses
his
job.
he
brings
suit
against
the
person
responsible
for
the
unlawful
arrest
and
he
claims
money
damages
for
the
loss
of
his
employment.
the
wrongful
act
on
which
such
a
suit
is
based
is
the
false
arrest
and
not
the
resulting
interference
with
his
employment.
if
the
false
arrest
had
not
taken
place,
there
would
not
have
been
any
interference
with
his
employment
or
consequent
damages
to
him
for
loss
of
earnings.
so
in
the
present
case,
the
wrongful
conduct
upon
which
his
suit
is
based
is
the
unlawful
suspension
from
union
membership.
without
this,
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action.
the
issue
to
which
the
idaho
court
addressed
itself
was
the
propriety
of
the
union’s
action
in
suspending
respondent
from
membership,
and
it
carefully
reviewed
and
followed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gonzales
in
fashioning
a
remedy.
it
pointed
out
that
under
idaho
law,
the
union
constitution
constitutes
a
contract
between
the
union
and
its
members,
and
that
the
wrongful
cancellation
of
respondent’s
union
membership
was
a
breach
of
contract
for
which
the
union
is
answerable
in
the
state
courts.
the
trial
judge
stated
in
his
memorandum
opinion
and
this
is
found
on
appendix
a
--
appendix
55,
“i
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
his
employer-employee
relation
in
this
relationship
in
this
action.
it
is
my
opinion
that
at
most,
i
can
restore
him
to
his
union
membership
as
of
the
date
of
his
wrongful
termination.
in
this,
i
am
attempting
to
follow
gonzales
as
i
see
it.”
the
idaho
supreme
court
similarly
concluded
that
the
trial
court
had
authority
to
correct
the
breach
of
contract
by
ordering
respondent
restored
to
membership,
and
that
in
line
with
gonzales,
it
had
authority
to
fill
out
the
remedy
by
awarding
damages
for
his
loss
of
earnings.
petitioner's
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
from
gonzales
is
really
an
exercise
in
semantics.
the
situation
here
is
in
all
respects
parallel
to
gonzales.
in
that
case,
the
employee
brought
suit
in
the
california
court
claiming
to
have
been
wrongfully
expelled
from
the
union
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
union
constitution,
and
he
asked
for
damages
for
the
resulting
loss
of
his
employment.
the
california
court
entered
judgment
ordering
his
reinstatement
and
awarded
damages
for
the
lost
earnings.
when
the
case
was
reviewed
by
this
court,
the
union
presented
the
same
preemption
argument
that
the
petitioner
is
now
advancing.
they
asserted
that
the
resulting
termination
of
respondent’s
employment
involved
discrimination
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
and
was
therefore
a
matter
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
this
court
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
undertake
to
protect
union
members
as
their
rights
in
their
rights
as
members
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
unions
and
union
officers
and
therefore,
the
state
court
had
the
power
to
grant
the
remedy
of
reinstatement.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
is
in
gonzales
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
held
that
the
labor
act
does
not
undertake
to
protect
union
members
in
their
rights
as
members
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
the
union
officers,
and
the
state
court
therefore
had
jurisdiction.
they
went
on
--
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
state
court
had
the
power
to
fill
out
this
remedy
by
an
award
of
damages
for
lost
of
wages
and
suffering
resulting
from
this
breach
of
contract
and
pointed
out
“no
radiation
of
the
taft-hartley
act
requires
us
to
mutilate
the
comprehensive
relief
of
equity
in
such
a
situation.”
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
closely
akin
to
those
presented
in
gonzales,
it
is
most
difficult
to
see
how
this
case
could
be
decided
in
any
other
manner.
the
borden
and
perko
cases
involved
substantially
different
factual
situations
than
the
present
case.
one
involved
the
hiring
hall
referral
system
under
which
the
union
refused
to
refer
man
to
a
job,
and
the
other
involved
discharge
of
a
foreman
for
assigning
work
to
another
trade.
neither
of
those
cases
involved
wrongful
suspension
of
union
membership
and
neither
affected
the
vitality
of
the
gonzales
decision.
it
was
not
necessary
in
any
event
for
the
idaho
supreme
court
to
rely
exclusively
on
gonzales
in
deciding
the
question
of
state
versus
nlrb
jurisdiction.
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings,
the
court
could
have
found
that
respondent
had
stated
a
proper
cause
of
action
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
which
authorizes
suits
for
violation
of
collective
bargaining
contracts
between
employers
and
unions.
it
was
clear
from
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
found
by
the
court
that
respondent’s
discharge
from
his
employment,
at
the
time
when
he
was
still
legally
and
rightfully
a
member
of
the
union
was
a
breach
of
the
existing
collective
contract
between
the
union
and
greyhound.
this
court
has
held
in
a
series
of
cases,
including
smith
versus
evening
news,
371
u.s.,
humphrey
versus
moore
in
375
u.s.,
and
vaca
versus
sipes
in
386
u.s.
that
an
employee
discharged
without
cause
may
sue
the
employer
or
the
union
under
section
301
in
either
federal
or
state
courts,
not
withstanding
that
the
discharge
also
involves
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
in
the
evening
news
case,
an
employee
of
a
newspaper
brought
suit
in
a
michigan
court
asserting
discriminatory
action
by
his
employer
in
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
discrimination
focused
on
employment
during
a
strike,
allowing
non-union
employees
to
report
for
work
and
paying
them
even
though
there
was
no
work
available,
but
denying
a
similar
privilege
to
the
plaintiff.
the
state
courts
refused
to
entertain
the
suit,
holding
that
the
discrimination
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
--
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
under
the
garmon
rule.
this
court
reversed,
holding
that
the
action
arose
under
section
301
and
was
not
preempted.
the
court
said
and
i
quote
“in
lucas
flour
as
well
as
in
atkinson,
the
court
expressly
refused
to
apply
the
preemption
doctrine
of
the
garmon
case,
and
we
likewise
reject
that
doctrine
here
where
the
alleged
conduct
of
the
employer,
not
only
arguably,
but
concededly
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
the
authority
of
the
board
to
deal
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
also
violates
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
is
not
displaced
by
section
301,
but
it
is
not
exclusive
and
does
not
destroy
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
suits
under
301.”
in
vaca
against
sipes,
again,
this
court
noted
that
under
the
section,
that
is
301,
“the
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
suits
to
enforce
collective-bargaining
agreements,
even
though
the
conduct
of
the
employer
which
is
challenged
as
a
breach
of
contract
is
also
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
he
could
have
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
he
could
also
have
removed
it
as
it
was
here.
there
was
sufficient
grounds
for
removal
in
the
case
as
filed
in
the
idaho
court
under
the
pleadings
as
filed.
there
was
a
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes.
there
was
diversity.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
say
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
say
could
have
removed
on
whatever
grounds
was
available
and
diversity
was
available
to
him
to
remove.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
think
it
would
be
removable,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
but
i
think
the
failure
to
remove
is
not
--
did
not
prejudice
the
petitioner
here,
for
the
reason
that
petitioner
had
the
opportunity
to
remove
the
case
as
it
was.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
right.
now,
the
union
argues
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
they
--
the
respondent
here
did
not
file
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
because
his
co-worker,
day,
filed
the
charge
with
the
labor
board,
and
the
labor
board
refused
to
entertain
it.
so
it
obviously
would
have
been
futile
for
him
to
file
with
the
labor
board.
now,
we
don’t
know
on
what
grounds
the
labor
board
refused
to
take
the
case
or
file
--
to
assume
jurisdiction.
it
might
very
well
be
that
the
labor
board
viewed
this
as
an
internal,
strictly
and
internal
of
the
union
matter,
which
was
within
the
state
court
jurisdiction,
and
they
just
said
we
won’t
handle
it.
that
left
him
with
no
place
to
go.
now,
the
petitioners
really
can’t
complain
that
they
didn’t
have
any
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
labor
board
in
this
respect.
the
--
they
had
all
of
the
opportunities
here
to
present
whatever
defenses
were
available
to
establish
that
their
conduct
was
not
unlawful
or
improper
or
prejudicial
or
discriminatory.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
is
the
--
the
source
of
this
action,
the
thing
that
caused
the
injury
was
his
suspension
from
the
union,
that
was
the
first
cause.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
correct.
now,
perko
did
not
involve
suspension
from
the
union
now.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
but
perko
was
never
suspended
from
the
union.
he
simply
couldn’t
get
a
job
because
the
union
put
him
on
some
kind
of
a
blacklist.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
no.
i
beg
your
pardon.
it’s
just
i
would
say
the
reverse
that
where
the
principal
point
is
between
the
man
and
a
union,
the
labor
board
has
no
jurisdiction.
this
--
in
gonzales,
this
court
held
very
clearly
that
the
congress
did
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
relationship
between
a
member
and
his
union
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
they
left
that
for
the
states
to
regulate
and
this
is
exactly
the
posture
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
no,
i
don’t
dispute
that.
this
was
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
was
a
distinction
that
i
believe
this
court
was
making
in
perko
and
borden
between
perko
and
borden
on
the
one
hand
and
gonzales
on
the
other.
that
perko
and
borden
dealt
primarily
with
the
employees,
the
member’s
efforts
to
obtain
employment,
whereas
gonzales
involved
his
unlawful
suspension
from
the
union
that
is
the
internal
union
relationship,
and
the
consequences
of
that
act.
the
consequences
being
his
loss
of
employment,
but
the
--
in
other
words,
it’s
a
two
step
proposition.
the
first
thing
the
union
does
is
suspend
him
from
membership
and
then
subsequently
or
as
a
consequence,
he
looses
his
job.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes,
he
would
have.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
he
could
have
sued
the
company
under
301.
the
company
did
breach
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes,
because
--
well
your
honor,
that
was
before
smith
versus
evening
news,
that
was
back
in
1960,
and
this
the
court
--
this
court
had
not
at
that
point
developed
quite
clearly
the
301
concept.
but
--
and
that
was
a
reason
why
he
dropped
the
suit
against
the
company.
but
today,
there’s
no
question
that
he
could
sustain
the
suit
against
a
company
under
301.
because
this
court
has
said
in
smith
versus
evening
news
and
humphrey
versus
moore
and
vaca
versus
sipes
and
the
whole
series
of
other
cases
that
a
man
who
is
improperly
discharged
may
sue
the
company
or
the
union
or
both
alleging
breach
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
and
he
can
maintain
that
suit
in
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
courts,
not
withstanding
that
the
conduct
complained
of
is
also
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
the
way
this
case
is
here,
right.
now,
he
can
sue
the
union
under
301.
he
doesn’t
have
to
join
the
employer
and
the
complaint
makes
out
a
case
for
jurisdiction
under
301.
it
alleges
facts
sufficient
to
support
a
breach
of
contract
between
the
union
and
the
company
in
greyhound.
now
in
humphrey
versus
moore,
the
same
question
was
presented.
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
not
alleged
301
as
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
his
suit
and
the
union
there
argued
as
the
union
argues
here
that
he
didn’t
because
he
didn’t
specifically
allege
301,
he
couldn’t
raise
its
subsequently.
but
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
two
allege
--
specifically
alleged
301
that
if
the
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action
under
301,
whether
or
not
it
involved
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
said
even
if
it
is
or
arguable
it
maybe
an
unfair
labor
practice,
the
complaint
here
alleged
that
moore’s
discharge
would
violate
the
contract,
and
was
therefore
within
the
cognizance
of
state
and
federal
courts;
citing
smith
versus
evening
news.
now,
the
trial
court
here
in
this
case
found
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
discharge
of
respondent
was
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
between
greyhound
and
the
union;
that’s
on
page
a60
of
the
appendix.
so,
there
was
in
effect
that
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
contract.
the
union
had
every
opportunity
to
defend
itself
on
that
point,
on
that
question
and
they
cannot
now
complain
that
they
didn’t
have
the
chance
to
remove
because
they
did
have
a
chance
to
remove.
in
addition
to
the
section
--
to
a
section
301
violation,
the
complaint
in
the
present
case
also
showed
on
it
face
a
violation
of
the
union’s
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
complaint
alleged
and
the
trial
court
found
on
page
60
--
appendix
61
that
not
withstanding
the
provisions
of
the
union
constitution,
relative
to
timely
payment
of
dues,
it
had
been
the
custom
and
practice
of
the
union
over
a
period
of
many
years
to
permit
members
to
be
in
arrears
of
their
dues
without
being
suspended,
even
though
the
arrears
exceeded
60
days.
that
respondent
and
his
fellow
worker
day
were
the
only
members
ever
suspended
for
this
reason,
and
that
the
union’s
purpose
was
to
punish
them
for
their
refusal
to
continue
their
check-off
authorization.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
for
their
refusal
to
continue
the
check-off.
they
had
revoked
their
check-offs
and
the
union
didn’t
like
it
and
they
said
we’re
going
to
punish
you
and
this
is
what
the
court
found
that
this
was
a
means
by
which
they
punished
them.
now,
this
we
say
is
an
invidious
violation
of
the
rights
of
the
employees.
it’s
discriminatory,
it’s
arbitrary
obviously
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
doctrine
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
doctrine
originated
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
with
the
steel
and
tunstall
cases,
and
it
has
evolved
through
the
years
and
has
been
most
recently
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
cases.
vaca
versus
sipes
being
one,
and
the
most
recent
being
sozack
versus
omara,
397
u.s.,
a
decision
handed
down
this
year
by
this
court.
this
--
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
difference
between
the
fiduciary
concept
and
the
duty
of
fair
representation
concept.
i
would
say
they
are
essentially
the
same.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
it
could
be.
it
maybe,
but
i
believe
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
strong
enough
concept
to
cover
this
situation.
it’s
obvious,
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
facts
as
pleaded
and
as
found
that
the
union
singled
this
man
out,
singled
him
and
day
out.
they
let
everybody
else
get
in
arrears
of
union
dues
and
they
didn’t
do
anything
about
it.
in
fact,
there
was
testimony
that
the
financial
secretary
of
the
union
made
it
a
practice
to
pay
up
the
union
dues
of
those
who
where
in
arrears.
in
this
case,
they
fired
the
man
or
had
him
fired,
even
before
he
was
notified.
on
the
2nd
of
november,
they
sent
notice
to
him.
he
didn’t
receive
it
until
some
time
later,
and
they
also
the
same
day,
obtained
his
discharge.
now,
he
immediately
upon
receipt
of
the
notice,
he
tried
to
pay
up
his
dues
and
he
repeatedly
proffered
his
dues
several
times
and
the
union
just
refused
to
take
it.
he
appealed
to
the
union
president
and
asked
them
to
take
the
money
and
the
union
president
wouldn’t
take
his
money
and
because
of
that,
because
of
$6.50,
he
has
been
deprived
of
a
job
for
10
years,
which
we
think
is
an
outrageous
consequence
of
such
a
minor
infraction
of
a
union
rule.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well
--
it
was
your
honor,
the
--
at
the
--
the
first
--
at
the
trial
court,
it
was
first
dismissed
on
the
preemption
doctrine.
the
plaintiff
had
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
idaho.
supreme
court
reinstated
the
case.
it
went
back
for
trial,
and
after
trial,
it
went
back
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
which
sustained
the
trial
court
finding
of
damages,
various
delays
in
between,
none
of
which
to
my
knowledge
were
the
fault
of
the
respondent
here.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
to
that
effect
your
honor
and
i
think
there
is
some
--
the
court
adverted
to
it.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
was
i
guess
before
the
check-off
was
instituted.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that
was
--
well,
prior
to
the
time,
this
suit
arose,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
there
were
others,
there
were
others.
there
was
a
movement
apparently
at
that
time
to
cancel
the
check-off.
there
was
a
petition
being
circulated
and
these
two
men
signed
it
and
they
were
the
two
that
got
caught
because
they
neglected
to
pay
the
dues
within
the
--
a
time
that
the
union
felt
that
they
were
required
to
pay
them,
but
again
at
the
constitution
of
the
union,
in
fact,
gave
them
60
days
to
pay.
they
couldn’t
be
suspended
unless
they
were
in
arrears
for
60
days.
i
have
one
final
point
i
believe
to
make
here.
the
--
well
in
summary,
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
to
the
--
i’m
sorry,
there
is
one
further
point.
section
83
of
the
union
constitution,
that
appears
on
page
87
of
the
appendix,
clearly
points
out
that
no
member
shall
be
allowed
to
injure
the
interest
of
a
fellow
member
by
undermining
him
in
place,
wages
or
in
any
other
willful
act
by
which
the
reputation
or
employment
of
any
member
maybe
injured.
now,
notwithstanding
that
provision
of
the
constitution,
the
union
clearly
did
interfere
with
his
employment
by
unlawfully
suspending
him
and
violated
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
in
summary,
there
are
number
of
exceptions
to
the
garmon
rule
which
would
sustain
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
exception
stated
in
garmon
and
gonzales,
“where
the
activity
regulated
is
of
merely
peripheral
concern
to
the
labor
management
act,
namely,
internal
union
matters,
the
second
is
jurisdiction
under
section
301
to
entertain
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
collective-bargaining
contract,
and
the
third
is
a
breach
of
the
duty
--
the
union’s
duty
of
fair
representation.”
the
fact
that
the
--
oh,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
there’s
no
question
that
respondent
lockridge
here
sustained
a
substantial
injury.
he
has
had
his
case
in
court
now
for
more
than
10
years.
he
was
out
of
work
entirely
for
almost
four
years
of
those
10
years.
in
order
to
find
another
job,
he
had
to
move
to
a
different
part
of
the
state
and
take
a
job
at
a
much
lower
rate
of
pay
than
he
had
been
earning
with
greyhound.
not
only
has
his
earning
level
been
reduced,
he
has
also
lost
all
of
the
benefits,
retirement,
medical
coverage,
burial
benefits
and
other
rights,
he
would
have
enjoyed
if
he
had
not
been
unlawfully
suspended
from
union
membership.
this
was
all
because
he
was
two
days
late
in
paying
$6.50
in
union
dues.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
under
the
--
but
the
union’s
right
to
suspend
him
from
membership
was
exe
--
or
the
union
suspension
of
him
from
membership
was
taken
on
the
basis
that
he
was
two
days
past
the
30
days
allowed
under
their
contention.
actually,
the
union
constitution
said
that
a
man
may
not
be
suspended
from
membership
unless
he
is
delinquent
from
dues,
unless
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
his
dues
are
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
his
dues
are
in
arrears,
and
where
a
member
allows
his
arrears
and
dues
finds
some
assessments
to
run
into
the
second
month
before
paying
the
same
shall
be
barred
from
benefit.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that
would
be
november
30th,
yes
sir.
if
lockridge
is
denied
a
remedy
for
these
--
for
the
wrongs
he
has
sustained,
there
will
be
a
grave
in
justice.
he
is
a
man
of
limited
education.
without
qualifications
to
do
much
else
and
drive
a
bus
and
he
is
a
physical
disability
which
limits
his
employment
opportunities.
now,
the
union
argues
that
the
remedy
given
him
by
the
state
court
cannot
stand
because
he
filed
the
wrong
form
of
pleading.
they
say
that
if
he
filed
a
complaint
asking
only
for
restoration
of
his
union
membership,
the
case
would
have
been
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
as
an
internal
union
matter.
his
mistake
they
say
was
that
he
asked
for
damages
for
loss
of
his
employment,
and
that
this
changed
the
whole
focus
of
this
case
to
one
for
interference
with
his
employment
relationship.
the
union
does
seeks
to
make
the
question
of
jurisdiction
turn
on
the
form
of
the
pleadings
rather
than
on
the
substance.
this
of
course
would
take
us
back
to
the
old
common
law
--
rules
of
common
law
pleading
with
all
the
hair
splitting
distinctions
between
different
forms
of
action,
whereas
under
current
practice,
it’s
the
substance
accounts
rather
than
the
form.
the
critical
act
which
gave
rise
to
this
case
was
the
suspension
of
respondent’s
membership
in
the
union.
the
loss
of
his
job
and
loss
of
his
income
was
a
result
of
that
act.
the
suit
which
he
brought
in
the
idaho
court
was
predicated
on
that
act.
the
money
damages
he
claimed
were
simply
the
measure
of
the
injury
he
sustained
because
of
that
act.
for
purposes
of
comparison,
let
us
take
a
situation
in
which
an
individual
is
unlawfully
arrested
and
detained
in
jail
and
as
a
consequence,
he
looses
his
job.
he
brings
suit
against
the
person
responsible
for
the
unlawful
arrest
and
he
claims
money
damages
for
the
loss
of
his
employment.
the
wrongful
act
on
which
such
a
suit
is
based
is
the
false
arrest
and
not
the
resulting
interference
with
his
employment.
if
the
false
arrest
had
not
taken
place,
there
would
not
have
been
any
interference
with
his
employment
or
consequent
damages
to
him
for
loss
of
earnings.
so
in
the
present
case,
the
wrongful
conduct
upon
which
his
suit
is
based
is
the
unlawful
suspension
from
union
membership.
without
this,
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action.
the
issue
to
which
the
idaho
court
addressed
itself
was
the
propriety
of
the
union’s
action
in
suspending
respondent
from
membership,
and
it
carefully
reviewed
and
followed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gonzales
in
fashioning
a
remedy.
it
pointed
out
that
under
idaho
law,
the
union
constitution
constitutes
a
contract
between
the
union
and
its
members,
and
that
the
wrongful
cancellation
of
respondent’s
union
membership
was
a
breach
of
contract
for
which
the
union
is
answerable
in
the
state
courts.
the
trial
judge
stated
in
his
memorandum
opinion
and
this
is
found
on
appendix
a
--
appendix
55,
“i
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
his
employer-employee
relation
in
this
relationship
in
this
action.
it
is
my
opinion
that
at
most,
i
can
restore
him
to
his
union
membership
as
of
the
date
of
his
wrongful
termination.
in
this,
i
am
attempting
to
follow
gonzales
as
i
see
it.”
the
idaho
supreme
court
similarly
concluded
that
the
trial
court
had
authority
to
correct
the
breach
of
contract
by
ordering
respondent
restored
to
membership,
and
that
in
line
with
gonzales,
it
had
authority
to
fill
out
the
remedy
by
awarding
damages
for
his
loss
of
earnings.
petitioner's
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
from
gonzales
is
really
an
exercise
in
semantics.
the
situation
here
is
in
all
respects
parallel
to
gonzales.
in
that
case,
the
employee
brought
suit
in
the
california
court
claiming
to
have
been
wrongfully
expelled
from
the
union
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
union
constitution,
and
he
asked
for
damages
for
the
resulting
loss
of
his
employment.
the
california
court
entered
judgment
ordering
his
reinstatement
and
awarded
damages
for
the
lost
earnings.
when
the
case
was
reviewed
by
this
court,
the
union
presented
the
same
preemption
argument
that
the
petitioner
is
now
advancing.
they
asserted
that
the
resulting
termination
of
respondent’s
employment
involved
discrimination
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
and
was
therefore
a
matter
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
this
court
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
undertake
to
protect
union
members
as
their
rights
in
their
rights
as
members
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
unions
and
union
officers
and
therefore,
the
state
court
had
the
power
to
grant
the
remedy
of
reinstatement.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
is
in
gonzales
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
held
that
the
labor
act
does
not
undertake
to
protect
union
members
in
their
rights
as
members
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
the
union
officers,
and
the
state
court
therefore
had
jurisdiction.
they
went
on
--
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
state
court
had
the
power
to
fill
out
this
remedy
by
an
award
of
damages
for
lost
of
wages
and
suffering
resulting
from
this
breach
of
contract
and
pointed
out
“no
radiation
of
the
taft-hartley
act
requires
us
to
mutilate
the
comprehensive
relief
of
equity
in
such
a
situation.”
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
closely
akin
to
those
presented
in
gonzales,
it
is
most
difficult
to
see
how
this
case
could
be
decided
in
any
other
manner.
the
borden
and
perko
cases
involved
substantially
different
factual
situations
than
the
present
case.
one
involved
the
hiring
hall
referral
system
under
which
the
union
refused
to
refer
man
to
a
job,
and
the
other
involved
discharge
of
a
foreman
for
assigning
work
to
another
trade.
neither
of
those
cases
involved
wrongful
suspension
of
union
membership
and
neither
affected
the
vitality
of
the
gonzales
decision.
it
was
not
necessary
in
any
event
for
the
idaho
supreme
court
to
rely
exclusively
on
gonzales
in
deciding
the
question
of
state
versus
nlrb
jurisdiction.
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings,
the
court
could
have
found
that
respondent
had
stated
a
proper
cause
of
action
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
which
authorizes
suits
for
violation
of
collective
bargaining
contracts
between
employers
and
unions.
it
was
clear
from
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
found
by
the
court
that
respondent’s
discharge
from
his
employment,
at
the
time
when
he
was
still
legally
and
rightfully
a
member
of
the
union
was
a
breach
of
the
existing
collective
contract
between
the
union
and
greyhound.
this
court
has
held
in
a
series
of
cases,
including
smith
versus
evening
news,
371
u.s.,
humphrey
versus
moore
in
375
u.s.,
and
vaca
versus
sipes
in
386
u.s.
that
an
employee
discharged
without
cause
may
sue
the
employer
or
the
union
under
section
301
in
either
federal
or
state
courts,
not
withstanding
that
the
discharge
also
involves
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
in
the
evening
news
case,
an
employee
of
a
newspaper
brought
suit
in
a
michigan
court
asserting
discriminatory
action
by
his
employer
in
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
discrimination
focused
on
employment
during
a
strike,
allowing
non-union
employees
to
report
for
work
and
paying
them
even
though
there
was
no
work
available,
but
denying
a
similar
privilege
to
the
plaintiff.
the
state
courts
refused
to
entertain
the
suit,
holding
that
the
discrimination
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
--
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
under
the
garmon
rule.
this
court
reversed,
holding
that
the
action
arose
under
section
301
and
was
not
preempted.
the
court
said
and
i
quote
“in
lucas
flour
as
well
as
in
atkinson,
the
court
expressly
refused
to
apply
the
preemption
doctrine
of
the
garmon
case,
and
we
likewise
reject
that
doctrine
here
where
the
alleged
conduct
of
the
employer,
not
only
arguably,
but
concededly
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
the
authority
of
the
board
to
deal
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
also
violates
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
is
not
displaced
by
section
301,
but
it
is
not
exclusive
and
does
not
destroy
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
suits
under
301.”
in
vaca
against
sipes,
again,
this
court
noted
that
under
the
section,
that
is
301,
“the
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
suits
to
enforce
collective-bargaining
agreements,
even
though
the
conduct
of
the
employer
which
is
challenged
as
a
breach
of
contract
is
also
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
he
could
have
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
he
could
also
have
removed
it
as
it
was
here.
there
was
sufficient
grounds
for
removal
in
the
case
as
filed
in
the
idaho
court
under
the
pleadings
as
filed.
there
was
a
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes.
there
was
diversity.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
say
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
say
could
have
removed
on
whatever
grounds
was
available
and
diversity
was
available
to
him
to
remove.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
think
it
would
be
removable,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
but
i
think
the
failure
to
remove
is
not
--
did
not
prejudice
the
petitioner
here,
for
the
reason
that
petitioner
had
the
opportunity
to
remove
the
case
as
it
was.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
right.
now,
the
union
argues
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
they
--
the
respondent
here
did
not
file
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
because
his
co-worker,
day,
filed
the
charge
with
the
labor
board,
and
the
labor
board
refused
to
entertain
it.
so
it
obviously
would
have
been
futile
for
him
to
file
with
the
labor
board.
now,
we
don’t
know
on
what
grounds
the
labor
board
refused
to
take
the
case
or
file
--
to
assume
jurisdiction.
it
might
very
well
be
that
the
labor
board
viewed
this
as
an
internal,
strictly
and
internal
of
the
union
matter,
which
was
within
the
state
court
jurisdiction,
and
they
just
said
we
won’t
handle
it.
that
left
him
with
no
place
to
go.
now,
the
petitioners
really
can’t
complain
that
they
didn’t
have
any
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
labor
board
in
this
respect.
the
--
they
had
all
of
the
opportunities
here
to
present
whatever
defenses
were
available
to
establish
that
their
conduct
was
not
unlawful
or
improper
or
prejudicial
or
discriminatory.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
is
the
--
the
source
of
this
action,
the
thing
that
caused
the
injury
was
his
suspension
from
the
union,
that
was
the
first
cause.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
correct.
now,
perko
did
not
involve
suspension
from
the
union
now.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
but
perko
was
never
suspended
from
the
union.
he
simply
couldn’t
get
a
job
because
the
union
put
him
on
some
kind
of
a
blacklist.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
no.
i
beg
your
pardon.
it’s
just
i
would
say
the
reverse
that
where
the
principal
point
is
between
the
man
and
a
union,
the
labor
board
has
no
jurisdiction.
this
--
in
gonzales,
this
court
held
very
clearly
that
the
congress
did
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
relationship
between
a
member
and
his
union
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
they
left
that
for
the
states
to
regulate
and
this
is
exactly
the
posture
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
no,
i
don’t
dispute
that.
this
was
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
was
a
distinction
that
i
believe
this
court
was
making
in
perko
and
borden
between
perko
and
borden
on
the
one
hand
and
gonzales
on
the
other.
that
perko
and
borden
dealt
primarily
with
the
employees,
the
member’s
efforts
to
obtain
employment,
whereas
gonzales
involved
his
unlawful
suspension
from
the
union
that
is
the
internal
union
relationship,
and
the
consequences
of
that
act.
the
consequences
being
his
loss
of
employment,
but
the
--
in
other
words,
it’s
a
two
step
proposition.
the
first
thing
the
union
does
is
suspend
him
from
membership
and
then
subsequently
or
as
a
consequence,
he
looses
his
job.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes,
he
would
have.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
he
could
have
sued
the
company
under
301.
the
company
did
breach
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes,
because
--
well
your
honor,
that
was
before
smith
versus
evening
news,
that
was
back
in
1960,
and
this
the
court
--
this
court
had
not
at
that
point
developed
quite
clearly
the
301
concept.
but
--
and
that
was
a
reason
why
he
dropped
the
suit
against
the
company.
but
today,
there’s
no
question
that
he
could
sustain
the
suit
against
a
company
under
301.
because
this
court
has
said
in
smith
versus
evening
news
and
humphrey
versus
moore
and
vaca
versus
sipes
and
the
whole
series
of
other
cases
that
a
man
who
is
improperly
discharged
may
sue
the
company
or
the
union
or
both
alleging
breach
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
and
he
can
maintain
that
suit
in
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
courts,
not
withstanding
that
the
conduct
complained
of
is
also
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that’s
the
way
this
case
is
here,
right.
now,
he
can
sue
the
union
under
301.
he
doesn’t
have
to
join
the
employer
and
the
complaint
makes
out
a
case
for
jurisdiction
under
301.
it
alleges
facts
sufficient
to
support
a
breach
of
contract
between
the
union
and
the
company
in
greyhound.
now
in
humphrey
versus
moore,
the
same
question
was
presented.
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
not
alleged
301
as
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
his
suit
and
the
union
there
argued
as
the
union
argues
here
that
he
didn’t
because
he
didn’t
specifically
allege
301,
he
couldn’t
raise
its
subsequently.
but
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
two
allege
--
specifically
alleged
301
that
if
the
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action
under
301,
whether
or
not
it
involved
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
said
even
if
it
is
or
arguable
it
maybe
an
unfair
labor
practice,
the
complaint
here
alleged
that
moore’s
discharge
would
violate
the
contract,
and
was
therefore
within
the
cognizance
of
state
and
federal
courts;
citing
smith
versus
evening
news.
now,
the
trial
court
here
in
this
case
found
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
discharge
of
respondent
was
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
between
greyhound
and
the
union;
that’s
on
page
a60
of
the
appendix.
so,
there
was
in
effect
that
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
contract.
the
union
had
every
opportunity
to
defend
itself
on
that
point,
on
that
question
and
they
cannot
now
complain
that
they
didn’t
have
the
chance
to
remove
because
they
did
have
a
chance
to
remove.
in
addition
to
the
section
--
to
a
section
301
violation,
the
complaint
in
the
present
case
also
showed
on
it
face
a
violation
of
the
union’s
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
complaint
alleged
and
the
trial
court
found
on
page
60
--
appendix
61
that
not
withstanding
the
provisions
of
the
union
constitution,
relative
to
timely
payment
of
dues,
it
had
been
the
custom
and
practice
of
the
union
over
a
period
of
many
years
to
permit
members
to
be
in
arrears
of
their
dues
without
being
suspended,
even
though
the
arrears
exceeded
60
days.
that
respondent
and
his
fellow
worker
day
were
the
only
members
ever
suspended
for
this
reason,
and
that
the
union’s
purpose
was
to
punish
them
for
their
refusal
to
continue
their
check-off
authorization.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
for
their
refusal
to
continue
the
check-off.
they
had
revoked
their
check-offs
and
the
union
didn’t
like
it
and
they
said
we’re
going
to
punish
you
and
this
is
what
the
court
found
that
this
was
a
means
by
which
they
punished
them.
now,
this
we
say
is
an
invidious
violation
of
the
rights
of
the
employees.
it’s
discriminatory,
it’s
arbitrary
obviously
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
doctrine
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
doctrine
originated
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
with
the
steel
and
tunstall
cases,
and
it
has
evolved
through
the
years
and
has
been
most
recently
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
cases.
vaca
versus
sipes
being
one,
and
the
most
recent
being
sozack
versus
omara,
397
u.s.,
a
decision
handed
down
this
year
by
this
court.
this
--
i’m
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
difference
between
the
fiduciary
concept
and
the
duty
of
fair
representation
concept.
i
would
say
they
are
essentially
the
same.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
it
could
be.
it
maybe,
but
i
believe
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
strong
enough
concept
to
cover
this
situation.
it’s
obvious,
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
facts
as
pleaded
and
as
found
that
the
union
singled
this
man
out,
singled
him
and
day
out.
they
let
everybody
else
get
in
arrears
of
union
dues
and
they
didn’t
do
anything
about
it.
in
fact,
there
was
testimony
that
the
financial
secretary
of
the
union
made
it
a
practice
to
pay
up
the
union
dues
of
those
who
where
in
arrears.
in
this
case,
they
fired
the
man
or
had
him
fired,
even
before
he
was
notified.
on
the
2nd
of
november,
they
sent
notice
to
him.
he
didn’t
receive
it
until
some
time
later,
and
they
also
the
same
day,
obtained
his
discharge.
now,
he
immediately
upon
receipt
of
the
notice,
he
tried
to
pay
up
his
dues
and
he
repeatedly
proffered
his
dues
several
times
and
the
union
just
refused
to
take
it.
he
appealed
to
the
union
president
and
asked
them
to
take
the
money
and
the
union
president
wouldn’t
take
his
money
and
because
of
that,
because
of
$6.50,
he
has
been
deprived
of
a
job
for
10
years,
which
we
think
is
an
outrageous
consequence
of
such
a
minor
infraction
of
a
union
rule.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well
--
it
was
your
honor,
the
--
at
the
--
the
first
--
at
the
trial
court,
it
was
first
dismissed
on
the
preemption
doctrine.
the
plaintiff
had
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
idaho.
supreme
court
reinstated
the
case.
it
went
back
for
trial,
and
after
trial,
it
went
back
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
which
sustained
the
trial
court
finding
of
damages,
various
delays
in
between,
none
of
which
to
my
knowledge
were
the
fault
of
the
respondent
here.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
to
that
effect
your
honor
and
i
think
there
is
some
--
the
court
adverted
to
it.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
was
i
guess
before
the
check-off
was
instituted.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
that
was
--
well,
prior
to
the
time,
this
suit
arose,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
there
were
others,
there
were
others.
there
was
a
movement
apparently
at
that
time
to
cancel
the
check-off.
there
was
a
petition
being
circulated
and
these
two
men
signed
it
and
they
were
the
two
that
got
caught
because
they
neglected
to
pay
the
dues
within
the
--
a
time
that
the
union
felt
that
they
were
required
to
pay
them,
but
again
at
the
constitution
of
the
union,
in
fact,
gave
them
60
days
to
pay.
they
couldn’t
be
suspended
unless
they
were
in
arrears
for
60
days.
i
have
one
final
point
i
believe
to
make
here.
the
--
well
in
summary,
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
to
the
--
i’m
sorry,
there
is
one
further
point.
section
83
of
the
union
constitution,
that
appears
on
page
87
of
the
appendix,
clearly
points
out
that
no
member
shall
be
allowed
to
injure
the
interest
of
a
fellow
member
by
undermining
him
in
place,
wages
or
in
any
other
willful
act
by
which
the
reputation
or
employment
of
any
member
maybe
injured.
now,
notwithstanding
that
provision
of
the
constitution,
the
union
clearly
did
interfere
with
his
employment
by
unlawfully
suspending
him
and
violated
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
in
summary,
there
are
number
of
exceptions
to
the
garmon
rule
which
would
sustain
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
exception
stated
in
garmon
and
gonzales,
“where
the
activity
regulated
is
of
merely
peripheral
concern
to
the
labor
management
act,
namely,
internal
union
matters,
the
second
is
jurisdiction
under
section
301
to
entertain
a
suit
for
breach
of
the
collective-bargaining
contract,
and
the
third
is
a
breach
of
the
duty
--
the
union’s
duty
of
fair
representation.”
the
fact
that
the
--
oh,
my
time
is
up.
