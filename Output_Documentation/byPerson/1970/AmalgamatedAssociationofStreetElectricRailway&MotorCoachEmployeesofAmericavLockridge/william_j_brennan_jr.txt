justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
groner,
may
i
ask
you.
the
judgment
of
page
66
has
both
an
awarded
damages,
$32,000.00
and
an
order
for
full
restoration
of
union
membership,
and
you
ask
i
gather
that
the
judgment
be
set
aside
in
toto.
i
notice
apparently
while
the
plaintiff
didn’t
seek
those
remedies,
that’s
the
way
the
paragraph
starts.
yet,
i
gather
idaho
law
is
that
he
is
entitled
to
all
relief
forwarded
by
the
evidence.
now,
would
preemption
reach
the
direction
for
full
restoration
of
union
membership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
thought
you
conceded
in
your
argument
in
chief
that
an
action
for
full
restoration
of
union
membership
is
a
state
law
action
between
the
member
and
the
union
which
would
be
maintainable
in
the
state
court,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
you
ask
for
that
in
the
state
court
and
also
damages,
then,
the
state
court
has
the
jurisdiction
as
to
both
remedies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
this
is
damages
for
loss
of
earnings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
i
know
your
time
is
limited,
but
why
is
it
this
to
say,
the
law
of
idaho
is
that
we
disregard
the
pleadings.
we
look
just
at
the
evidence,
and
the
evidence
indicates
that
this
is
an
action
among
other
things
for
restoration
of
union
membership,
and
therefore
we
going
to
enter
an
order
of
restoration
of
union
membership.
how
can
this
court
do
anything
about
that
question
of
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it,
this
is
only
a
remedy
for
an
action
with
--
the
thrust
of
which
was
directed
at
the
employment
relationship
and
not
at
the
membership
