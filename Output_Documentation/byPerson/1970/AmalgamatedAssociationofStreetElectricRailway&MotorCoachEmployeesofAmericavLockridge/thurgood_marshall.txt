oh
mr.
groner,
what
difference
of
punitive
damages
make,
if
any?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
difference
does
it
make
that
he
also
asked
for
punitive
damages,
is
that
necessary
at
all
in
your
case,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
amount
of
damages?
he
would
not
have
worked
that
long,
it's
just
back
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i’m
trying
to
get
at
that
that’s
the
same
thing
he
would
have
done
if
the
nlrb
had
agreed
to
him
and
given
him
back
wages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
true
are
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
petitioner
also
complains
that
he
didn’t
have
chance
at
the
nlrb?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
petitioner
also
complains
that
that
he
didn’t
have
a
chance
to
argue
the
case
before
the
nlrb?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
just
the
federal
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
agree
that
this
is
strictly
a
matter
between
lockridge
and
the
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
in
the
language
of
the
perko
that
was
principally
if
not
entirely
on
the
union’s
action
with
respect
to
the
member’s
efforts
to
obtain
employment.
that’s
the
language
of
perko,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
i
know,
but
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
that
one
of
the
basis
for
the
holding
of
this
court
that
where
it
is
entirely
or
at
least
principally
a
matter
between
the
man
--
the
union,
you
first
talk
to
nlrb?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
language,
you
dispute
is
language
that's
quoted
here
in
the
government’s
brief
on
page
11
at
the
top
of
the
page?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
was
just
quoted
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
union
gave
him
back
his
membership
wouldn’t
he
have
his
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
union
is
in
it
at
the
beginning
and
that
end
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
company
is
not
in
it
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
sue
the
company
and
then
dropped
the
charge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
to
that,
when
the
case
gets
to
us,
it’s
obvious
in
action
of
a
complaint
of
an
employee
against
his
own
labor
union.
justice
thurgood
marshall
period,
nothing
more
