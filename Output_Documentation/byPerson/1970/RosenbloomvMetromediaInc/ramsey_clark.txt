mr.
ramsey
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
defamation
suit
brought
under
the
laws
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
the
united
stated
district
court,
jurisdiction
being
on
its
diversity.
before
stating
the
facts,
let
me
state
the
question
briefly.
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
of
course
began
to
apply
the
first
amendment
to
the
laws
of
defamation
and
libel
which
had
interfered
historically.
it
began
in
that
area
of
conduct
of
public
officials
engaging
in
official
conduct
and
said
that
“only
where
an
actual
malice
can
be
shown,
can
the
state
statutes
permitting
recovery
for
defamation
applied”
otherwise
there’ll
be
a
chilling
effect,
there
will
not
be
adequate
breathing
room
for
freedom
of
speech.
the
question
here
is
whether
that
rule
is
to
be
extended
to
the
very
private
individual
to
the
200
million
americans
who
are
not
famous,
who
are
not
public
officials,
and
who
are
not
public
figures
such
as
coach
butch
or
general
edwin
walker,
who
are
just
plain
people
engaging
in
ordinary
life.
this
petitioner,
george
a.
rosenbloom,
was
a
successful
salesman
for
the
major
magazine
and
book
distributor
in
the
united
states.
in
that
capacity
in
1962,
he
was
offered
a
major
distributorship
for
american
outdoor
publishing
corporation
which
publishes
nudist
magazines.
he
carefully
considered
because
he
was
a
man
concerned,
as
the
record
shows
about
his
reputation,
whether
to
take
this
opportunity.
he
even
consulted
a
lawyer.
he
was
advised
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
held
that
these
publications
were
legal
and
after
many
months
on
the
first
of
may,
he
accepted
the
distributorship
and
became
the
distributor
in
the
philadelphia
area
for
this
publishing
company.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
emphasis
arises
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
emphasis
arises
from
what
i
believe
is
the
constitutional
and
certainly
the
national
concern
for
reputation.
here
was
a
man
that
was
concerned
about
his
reputation.
this
is
a
defamation
action,
and
as
the
facts
were
disclosed,
a
jury
found
he
was
defamed
and
he
was
a
man
who
was
cautious
enough
before
getting
into
this
business
to
be
sure
that
it
was
a
proper
business,
a
legal
business
and
it
happened
to
be
a
business
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
itself
had
reviewed
and
upheld.
on
october
the
1st
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
certainly
bears
on
that,
yes.
it
bears
also
on
his
care
for
his
reputation
too,
which
i
think
is
important.
on
the
1st
of
october
in
1963,
there
were
series
of
raids
on
newsstands
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
by
the
city
police.
on
that
day,
approximately
20
newsstands
employees
were
arrested.
this
petitioner,
george
rosenbloom
who
happened
to
be
making
a
delivery
of
his
magazines
at
one
at
the
time
was
also
arrested.
and
on
october
the
4th
of
1963,
there
begun
a
series
of
more
than
21
broadcast
in
which
this
respondent
here
referred
to
him
in
his
business,
this
first
broadcast
which
came
over
the
air
at
6
pm
on
october
the
4th
begun
city
cracks
down
on
smut
merchants.
there
had
been
7
or
8
arrests
on
october
the
4th
and
on
that
day
the
wip,
the
metromedia
station
philadelphia
now
says
mr.
rosenbloom’s
home
had
been
raided.
they
gave
his
whole
name
and
his
address.
they
referred
to
no
other
one
else
arrested.
they
stated
they
had
been
confiscated
at
his
home
1000
magazines
and
that
he
had
been
arrested
on
the
charge
of
possession
of
obscene
literature.
in
addition,
it
stated
that
a
barn
that
he
rented
had
been
raided,
and
there
were
confiscated
obscene
books.
it
did
not
say
allegedly
obscene
books,
it
said
obscene
books.
it
said
too
that
captain
ferguson
who
was
in
charge
of
special
investigating
unit
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
at
that
time
believed
the
police
had
hit
the
supply
of
the
main
distributor
of
obscene
material
in
the
philadelphia
area.
the
second
--
they
were
broadcast
through
that
night
through
the
next
day
that
repeated
generally
this.
the
word
allegedly
obscene
books
was
added
in
some
subsequent
broadcast.
a
second
series
of
broadcast
begun
on
october
21st,
repeated
in
variations
on
the
25th
and
on
november
the
1st.
these
addressed
themselves
to
a
lawsuit
that
the
petitioner
here
had
filed
to
enjoin
the
police
department
and
the
newspaper
and
radio
station
in
philadelphia
from
harassment
interfering
with
his
business.
it
did
not
endeavor
to
enjoin
generally
their
conduct,
but
only
insofar
as
he
was
concerned.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
this
was
a
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
record
doesn’t
show.
the
last
reference
in
the
record
indicates
that
the
judge
would
decide
next
week.
this
damage
suit
filed
later
and
came
up
before
the
same
judge,
judge
joseph
lord
iii
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
the
broadcast
characterized
plaintiffs
as
smut
distributors,
girly
book
peddlers
and
as
attempting
to
the
force
--
to
force
the
defendants,
which
included
the
chief
of
police
and
the
newspapers
and
radio
stations
to
lay
off
the
smut
literature
racket.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
the
characterization
by
its
choice,
by
the
radio
station
of
these
materials
as
obscene
is
certainly
a
major
element,
but
there
many
other
elements.
i
think
to
have
relied
upon
the
captain
of
police
who
had
phoned
this
in
under
the
impression
that
he
had
some
duty
to
inform
the
public.
in
other
words,
in
contrast
to
sullivan
v.
new
york
times,
here
you
have
sullivan
calling
new
york
times
and
giving
them
a
story
about
some
fellow
out
in
the
street,
and
as
the
fellow
out
in
the
street
in
this
situation
who
is
not
known
to
anybody.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
i
would
agree
with
judge
lord
that
the
editorialization
and
the
sensational
way
in
which
they
characterized
his
conduct
would
be
defamatory.
i
think
it
would
diminish
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
man,
and
i
think
it
would
damage
his
business
as
certainly
this
damaged
his
business
very
severely.
he
lost
34
out
of
60
accounts
that
he’d
been
able
to
build
up,
and
he
went
out
of
business
in
fact.
the
other
things
that
were
said
that
would
add
to
that
of
course,
that
he
was
the
main
distributor
of
obscene
material
in
philadelphia,
and
i
was
relying
on
captain
ferguson
perhaps,
but
do
they
really
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
him
without
any
examination.
is
this
going
to
protect
free
speech,
or
is
it
really
going
to
interfere
with
free
speech
when
the
police
use
the
press
as
an
extension
of
their
enforcement
arm,
or
vice
versa?
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
an
important
element,
yes
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
defamatory
nature
of
that
is
certainly
perfectly
clear
to
me.
i
think
there
could
be
very
little
doubt
about
it,
but
the
impression
too
that
he
is
trying
to
get
to
prevent
law
enforcement
from
doing
its
duty,
so
to
speak,
to
lay
off
the
smut
literature
racket
is
just
erroneous.
he
was
just
trying
to
protect
his
own
interest
as
a
businessman,
as
a
successful
small
business
man
in
these
sales.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
raid
was
on
the
day
of
the
4th,
october
the
4th
and
the
first
broadcast
was
at
6
p.m.
on
the
4th.
now
in
the
subsequent
broadcast,
because
this
went
on
from
october
4
through
november
1,
the
first
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
sir.
october
4th,
5th,
october
21,
25
and
november
1,
but
they’re
over
21
different
broadcast
going
out
to
the
entire
radio
audience
in
that
metropolitan
area.
of
course
mr.
rosenbloom
can’t
have
every
radio
station
on.
he
doesn’t
really
find
out
until
people
tell
him
what
been
said
about
him,
and
he
has
to
go
down
to
confirm
it.
but
there
was
a
delay
of
more
than
a
week
from
the
time
he
filed
his
injunction
suit
trying
to
prevent
harassment
and
interference
with
his
lawful
business
and
the
time
that
the
second
series,
as
we’ve
described
in
the
litigation
of
these
broadcast
began
on
october
21.
so
it
could
hardly
be
called
hot
news.
a
week
had
gone
by
before
they
came
on
and
characterized
him
as
a
smut
distributor
and
a
girly
book
peddler
and
attempting
to
force
the
police
and
the
district
attorney
to
lay
off
smut
literature
racket.
on
october
27,
mr.
rosenbloom
went
to
the
radio
station.
he
had
heard
this.
the
people
were
complaining
to
him
as
the
records
show,
the
people
he
sold
to.
his
friends
wouldn’t
talk
to
him,
and
he
asked
to
see
copies
or
to
hear
some
of
the
broadcast.
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
anybody.
this
is
the
plight
of
someone
trying
to
engage
in
robust
dispute
in
mass
society
with
the
media,
but
he
was
put
on
the
phone
with
a
part
time
employee
who
dug
up
one
of
the
tapes
and
played
it
back
to
him.
mr.
rosenbloom
protested
that
the
supreme
court
had
said
that
this
material
was
not
obscene.
the
individual
who
was
working
for
the
radio
station
said
the
da
had
said
it
was
obscene
and
mr.
rosenbloom
replied
that
the
da
had
said
in
fact
that
it
was
legal
and
at
that
time
they
hung
up
on
him
as
the
extent
of
his
opportunity
to
speak
out.
wally
butts
can
get
on
television
as
he
did,
general
edwin
walker
is
on
television
before
he
leaves
dallas
to
go
to
oxford,
mississippi,
a
judge
telling
the
public
what
it
ought
to
do
because
he’s
a
public
figure.
george
a.
rosenbloom
is
like
most
people
in
this
world,
the
overwhelming
majority,
not
a
public
figure.
the
jury
charge
said
that
there
be
four
elements
in
the
proof
of
defamation
for
general
damages.
first
that
there
was
harm
to
the
reputation
of
the
plaintiff
that
it
lowered
him
in
the
estimation
of
his
peers
and
that
it
deterred
third
persons
from
engaging
in
commerce
with
him.
second
that
the
allegations
that
were
made
could
reasonably
be
taken
to
refer
to
the
plaintiff
while
his
name
and
his
address
given
in
this
case.
third,
that
the
people
exercised
reasonable
care
to
determine
the
truth
of
what
they
were
saying
in
for
which
they
were
sued
and
fourth
that
it
was
false.
to
recover
punitive
damages,
it
was
required
that
malice
be
shown
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
and
the
malice
charge
there
roughly
was
that
it
was
published
or
caused
to
be
broadcast
with
the
bad
motive
or
reckless
indifference
to
the
rights
of
others.
the
jury
came
in,
the
judge
--
well
first
the
jury
came
in
with
a
verdict
of
general
damages
in
the
amount
of
$25,000.00
and
punitive
damages
in
the
amount
of
$725,000.00.
the
jury
had
seen
some
of
the
magazines.
the
judge
required
a
remitature
of
$500,000.00
but
he
found
that
malice
was
present
that
there
were
at
least
three
substantial
indications
of
it
in
the
record,
and
that
the
defendant
there
had
broadcast
in
a
sensational
way
and
in
an
editorializing
way
about
the
rights
of
this
private
citizen.
he
refused
to
apply
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
because
he
felt
that
it
applied
only
to
public
officials
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
individuals.
that
the
first
amendment
protection
was
intended
to
protect
the
processes
of
government
and
the
conduct
of
government
officials,
the
elective
process
and
such
things
and
did
not
intend
to
permit
people
to
defame
the
private
citizen
in
america
and
destroy
some
of
the
quality
of
his
life,
only
if
he
could
show
that
there
was
actual
malice
in
a
broadcast.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
basis
of
new
york
times.
the
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ramsey
clark
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
say
a
word
to
about
the
facts
first.
i
don’t
argue
facts,
the
record
can
speak
for
itself,
but
some
of
views
indicated
in
the
nature
of
the
argument
and
rebuttal.
mr.
segal
complaints
about
our
reference
to
a
headline,
there
has
been
no,
on
this
broadcast,
there
has
been
no
complaint
about
reference
to
headline
before,
it’s
clearly
in
the
record,
page
26a,
it’s
in
our
briefs
as
testified
to
at
the
trial
and
it
characterized
the
nature
of
the
broadcast.
he
complaints
about
our
describing
the
broadcast
to
series,
they
were
clearly
series,
they
would
go
on
every
30
minutes
after
they
began.
i
described
them
as
a
single
series,
but
its
two
series
that
over
a
period
of
time
occupied
almost
a
month
beginning
october
4
and
5
and
picking
up
again
october
21,
going
to
november
1.
i
think
his
reference
to
the
record
where
mr.
rosenbloom
met
someone
in
a
café
who
describe
the
broadcast
that
he
heard
and
his
reaction
shows
the
real
problem
of
a
little
man.
if
you’re
edwin
walker
or
if
you’re
wally
butts
or
someone
and
there
is
something
derogatory
said
about
you,
your
phone
rings
all
night,
the
press
wants
to
get
your
views
about
it,
they’re
anxious
to
hear
from
you.
if
you’re
george
a.
rosenbloom,
nobody
calls.
you
find
out
from
your
friends.
you
find
out
when
you
go
back
around
to
serve
some
account
and
they
won’t
buy
it
from
you
anymore.
you
find
out
you’re
ruined
and
then
you
got
to
find
out
why
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
do
it
on
your
own
because
you’re
a
little
man
and
nobody
is
going
to
take
care
of
you,
you
are
not
allowed
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
equal
time
theory
and
the
law
shows
that
we
are
prepared
to
require
the
radio
to
try
to
be
fair,
but
equal
time
refers
to
opinion
to
raise,
the
editorialization
of
this
did
smack
of
sensationalism
and
the
views
of
the
trial
judge
and
of
editorializing,
but
i
don’t
think
that
there
has
been
any
extension
of
equal
time
to
the
ideas
obtained
in
news
reporting,
people
as
to
whom
news
is
reported
have
an
opportunity
to
come
on
in
and
say
something
if
a
commentator
has
an
editorial
and
he
discusses
you
or
an
issue
then
you
have
an
opportunity,
but
certainly
within
my
experience,
there
has
been
no
equal
opportunity
time
on
fact
news
broadcasting
and
i’m
not
sure
how
you
would
function
with
something
like
that.
mr.
rosenbloom
couldn’t
even
get
them
to
discuss
the
issue
with
him,
how
he
would
have
gotten
in,
i
mean
they
hung
up
on
him,
that’s
how
he
can
reach
the
metromedia
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
(inaudible)
is
coming
and
reporters
find,
my
understanding
of
his
comment
was,
if
the
reporters
find
that
people
who
are
charged
with
crime
don’t
want
to
discuss
that
with
them,
their
lawyers
advises
them
not
to
discuss
that
with
them
and
that
maybe
generally
true,
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
law
that
indicates
that
there
is
a
right
to
equal
time
for
news
broadcasting,
but
even
if
there
were,
i
think
mr.
rosenbloom
quite
as
clearly
illustrated
in
this
situation,
you
know
mr.
segal
says
it
was
october
21
when
he
first
discovered
about
the
broadcast,
that
doesn’t
mean
he
wasn’t
hurt,
he
was
deeply
and
desperately
hurt,
but
how
could
he
know,
he
can’t
listen
to
every
radio
stations
broadcasting,
how
is
he
going
to
find
out.
he
finds
out
when
somebody
tells
him,
and
then
he
goes
down
and
he
tries
to
talk
as
a
little
man
at
the
people
at
the
station,
they
get
a
part
time
man
to
talk
to
him
on
a
telephone
that
he
can’t
even
see
and
that
person
hangs
up.
it’s
very
important
too
i
think
that
we
realize
if
this
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
a
single
charge.
there
was
no
effort
by
the
defense
in
the
trial
of
this
case
to
say
was
this
allegation
true
or
false
or
obscene,
it
was
all
submitted
on
a
single
charge,
the
whole
period
of
time.
had
there
been
some
distinction
there
then
i
think
maybe
this
court
could
try
to
make
some
distinctions
between
the
separate
allegations
but
when
you
take
them
all
as
a
whole,
they
wind
up
leaving
the
impression
that
the
man
in
the
café
who
gave
to
george
rosenbloom,
they
want
to
lock
that
guy
up
and
throw
the
key
away,
and
that’s
the
best
that
he
can
find
out
as
an
individual.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
the
libel
is
to
be
evaluated
on
what
the
jury
had
before
it
in
the
record,
all
these
material.
i’m
just
saying
that
they
could
--
that
the
impression
that
was
left
as
the
trial
judge
showed
in
his
opinion,
i
didn’t
say
just
charge
the
jury,
he
didn’t
say
anything
about
retraction
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
that
all
came
after
the
jury
verdict
when
he
wrote
his
opinion.
mr.
ramsey
clark
apparently
there
was
no
objection
to
it
and
certainly
respondent
shows
no
concern
about
this
time
because
he’s
the
one
that
injects
it
in
this
hearing
not
us.
but
i
assume
it
was
to
show
how
it
was
that
mr.
rosenbloom
came
to
inquire
of
the
radio
station,
why
he
went
down
to
the
radio
station
to
see
what
they
had
played.
it’s
very
interesting
to
note
too
that
there
are
eight
women
on
this
jury
that
they
saw
that
magazine
and
we
can
tell
what
impression
it
had
on
them
by
the
verdict
they
gave.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes
sir.
let
me
now
state
again
my
view
of
the
law,
before
i
do
it,
i
think
it’s
important
to
realize
that
mr.
rosenbloom
was
put
out
of
business.
he
lost
34
of
60
accounts
right
away
and
he
subsequently
had
to
go
out
of
business.
i
think
there’s
going
to
have
to
be
some
lines
your
honor
on
new
york
times
and
i
think
the
first
amendment
will
require
these
things.
where
the
discussion
is
of
an
issue
that
it
be
uninhibited,
robust,
wide
open,
you
can
discuss
nudism,
you
can
discuss
magazine
distribution.
that
to
have
actionable
defamation
of
a
public
official
or
a
public
figure
because
public
figures
are
part
of
the
story,
they’re
part
of
the
process
of
learning
the
truth,
they
can
be
the
done
only
where
there’s
actual
malice,
only
where
there
is
actual
malice
can
recovery
be
made
for
defamatory
action.
but
where
you
come
to
the
individual,
the
private
person
who
has
no
chance
to
engage
really
in
robust
or
wide
open
discussion
of
these
issues
with
metromedia,
that
the
power
of
technology
and
communication,
the
power
to
debate
these
issues
in
the
marketplace
of
public
opinion
for
private
citizens
in
this
country
is
very,
very
limited
and
they
can
be
crashed
as
well
as
mr.
rosenbloom.
so,
actionable
defamation
of
a
purely
private
person
such
as
he
can
be
maintained
only
where
there
is
a
lack
of
reasonable
care,
that
happened
to
be
the
pennsylvania
standard.
that
was
the
standard
that
was
applied
here,
but
to
support
the
punitive
damages,
there
was
also
a
charge
of
malice
and
the
jury
found
actionable
damages
and
it
found
malice
under
the
pennsylvania
law
and
that
charge
was
very
similar
to
the
charge
in
the
butts
case
and
as
you
know
the
butts
case,
the
recovery
was
allowed
to
stand,
i
think
that
would
be
fair
here
because
there
was
no
way
for
the
attorney
for
mr.
rosenbloom
at
that
time
to
ever
believe
that
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
could
be
extended
from
the
commissioner
of
police
in
montgomery
county
to
george
a.
rosenbloom
when
he
was
confronted
by
both
the
police
and
the
press
in
opposition
to
his
livelihood.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
my
opinion
of
where
the
law
ought
to
go,
it’s
not
there
at
this
time
in
my
judgment.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
don’t
argue
that.
i
think
timely
heal
shows
the
problems
there
but
i
think
there’s
immense
difference
between
defamation
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
sir,
i’m
really
arguing
for
the
constitutional
rule
that
you’ve
expressed
in
at
least
two
opinions
that
negligence
be
the
standard
where
it’s
a
private
individual.
but
as
to
the
masses
of
our
people,
they
don’t
have
no
opportunity
to
really
debate,
there
is
no
marketplace
in
which
their
opinions
can
be
tested
against
metromedia,
and
therefore,
anyone
who
will
defame
them
must
use
reasonable
care
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
what
he
says.
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
truth.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
would
fall
within
what
i
would
consider
an
acceptable
federal
constitutional
rule
and
therefore
it
would
be
any
lesser
rule
within
the
state
wanted
to
impose
would
be
adequate,
but
this
rule
requires
reasonable
care
even
for
the
private
citizen
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
any
rule
that
didn’t
impinge
more
greatly
on
free
speech,
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
was
perhaps
be
my
argument
as
an
advocate
in
this
case
that
mr.
rosenbloom’s
judgment
here
would
be
affirmed
under
any
of
those
tests.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
my
view
as
a
lawyer,
my
view
as
a
lawyer
is
that
the
constitution
does
provide
some
protection
to
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
discussion
even
of
the
little
people,
that
that
is
important
to
the
discovery
of
truth
too
but
where
you
are
going
to
discuss
the
little
people,
you’re
going
to
have
to
exercise
reasonable
care.
and
because
the
little
man
can’t
show
actual
malice,
how
can
george
rosenbloom
show
that
there
was
actual
malice
in
metromedia,
they
never
heard
of
him
before,
they
don’t
know
and
they
never
met
him,
he
can’t
see
them
face
to
face,
he
has
to
talk
to
them
over
telephone.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes
it
would
mr.
justice.
my
view
is
the
central
purpose
as
you
stated
so
beautifully
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
activities
of
government,
that
they
really
be
open
to
full
vigorous
discussion
and
debate
so
that
the
truth
maybe
known,
but
there’s
some
value
to
in
discussion
in
knowing
the
little
things
about
little
people,
but
if
you
discuss
them
in
a
way
that
does
more
than
invades
their
privacy,
that
actually
defames
them
and
injures
them
and
puts
them
out
of
business,
you’re
going
to
have
to
use
reasonable
care,
because
we
do
have
that
regard
for
the
individual
here
too.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
don’t
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
case
here
and
i’m
sure
that
it
won’t
feel
that
duty
itself.
in
my
judgment
though,
the
discussion
of
the
issue
is
valuable,
that’s
how
you
find
the
truth
and
we
need
to
have
some
room
there,
but
we
do
need
to
have
reasonable
care
because
it’s
awfully
important
that
press
have
exercise
care
too
with
the
concentration
we
have
there.
if
there
is
no
standard
of
care,
if
we
have
to
show
actual
malice,
how
will
get
excellence
to
professionalism
in
our
effort
to
report
the
truth.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
your
honor,
i
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
truth.
i
think
discussion
has
to
have
wide
breathing
room
and
certainly
everything
i’ve
tried
to
argue
indicates
that,
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
says
you
can
--
that
our
purpose
is
to
permit
untruthful
statement,
purposeful
untruthful
statements,
malicious
statements.
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
truth,
to
be
sure
that
the
truth
can
be
discovered
because
it’s
very
difficult
to
find,
we
have
to
give
it
a
wide,
wide
breathing
room,
where
public
officials
or
public
figures
are
involved,
actual
malice
should
be
the
rule,
as
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in
butts
and
walker
and
new
york
times.
but
when
it’s
a
private
individual,
if
you
feel
you
have
to
comment
on
them
rather
than
issues
which
they’re
engaged
in,
and
you
can
have
a
very
vigorous
discussion
of
the
issues
without
defaming
an
individual,
but
if
you
go
to
the
private
individual,
then
you
must
use
reasonable
care.
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
cherish
for
your
speech
and
it
think
that
is
indicated
here.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
the
fact
that
the
defendants
did
not
ask
for
special
charges
or
special
instructions
or
special
findings
on
the
various
broadcast
indicates
that
the
court
will
have
to
look
at
the
thing
as
a
whole
too.
as
i’m
sure
some
of
the
customers,
the
buyers
from
mr.
rosenbloom
did,
because
they
heard
them
all
and
they
knew
that
this
was
mr.
rosenbloom
that
they
knew.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
think
we’ve
sustained
verdicts
of
that
dimension.
i
think
it’s
impressive
that
the
jury
felt
that
an
individual
had
been
so
offended.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
true
and
i
think
the
biggest
verdict
of
all
was
in
the
butts
case
which
this
court
permitted
to
stand.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
that
maybe
somewhat
implicit
there,
we
talked
about
free
speech
and
we
talk
about
free
press.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
they’re
both
valuable
and
important,
and
i
think
that
reasonable
care
though
where
the
private
individual
is
concerned
in
mass
society,
it’s
going
to
be
essential
to
human
dignity.
i
just
don’t
how
the
little
man
can
survive
if
the
press
decides
to
go
after
him,
you’ll
never
show
actual
malice.
mr.
ramsey
clark
or
the
little
woman.
[laughter]
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
need
a
word
that
covers
both
or
a
little
yet
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
next
sentence
your
honor
says
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
first
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
first
two
sentences
would
probably
be
alright
under
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
think
they’re
reporting
a
new
story,
the
police
did
do
these
things.
the
second
too
involved
quite
different
considerations
but
the
headline
begins
with
the
characterization
of
smuts
--
scratch
down
on
smut
merchants,
there
were
on
that
day
seven
or
eight
arrests,
the
material
seized
on
october
1,
mr.
rosenbloom
were
only
a
small
part,
a
very
small
part
of
the
material
seized.
there
were
twenty
people
arrested
that
day.
in
this
enlargement
of
his
role,
this
characterization
of
him
is
not
going
to
raise
him
in
the
esteem
of
his
customers
or
his
fellow
man.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
listener
having
heard
the
george
a.
rosenbloom
and
hearing
this
all
around
together
is
going
to
assume
that
they’re
talking
about
anyone
else.
we
have,
i
think
even
mr.
segal
said
if
you
take
that
sounds
out
of
context
but
can
we
really
assume
that
the
radio
audience
takes
it
out
of
context?
you’re
driving
along
in
your
car
and
you
hear
george
a.
rosenbloom
and
they’ve
seized
3,000
obscene
books
and
they’re
cracking
down
on
smut
merchants.
mr.
ramsey
clark
for
the
actual
damages
or
general
damages
as
they’re
called
in
pennsylvania
$25,000.00
and
the
punitive
damages
as
reduced
by
remittitur
to
$250,000.00.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
your
honor,
we
haven’t
really
raised
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
the
power
of
the
court
to
reduce
it
and
if
--
or
in
the
court
below
so
if
that’s
something
is
really
not
here
on
the
record,
the
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
imagine
there
are
your
honor.
that
was
a
ruling
of
the
trial
court
and
it’s
here
without
objection
at
this
level.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
the
status
of
the
case
in
this
posture,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
we
would
have
an
obligation
to
raise
that
as
a
basis
for
our
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
haven’t
really
considered
that
your
honor,
and
i
think
i
would
have
to,
to
be
helpful
to
the
court.
that
maybe
something
down
the
road,
if
i
don’t
think
you
can
embrace
free
speech
i
think
we
have
to
live
by
the
first
amendment,
in
fact,
we
would
be
a
lot
better
of
if
we
insist
on
it.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
there
maybe
another
test,
the
only
other
test
i
can
see
is
the
newsworthy
test
or
the
issue
test,
and
i
don’t
believe
distinctions
can
be
made
there.
i
think
when
the
news
broadcast
something
it
is
ipso
facto
news
worthy.
and
i
think
really
what
defamation
is
all
about
is
people
and
reputations
and
that’s
where
the
hard
line
will
have
to
be
drawn
between
the
private
people.
they
were
not
within
the
original
contemplation
really
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
sense,
we’re
not
scrutinizing
the
conduct
of
public
officials
here
and
the
mass
power
of
media
that
they
can’t
answer
or
really
debate
with.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
at
first,
if
he’s
a
public
official,
i
think
that's
pretty
clear.
i
think
if
he
is
a
public
figure
then
the
test
might
be
whether
his
history
has
been
such
that
the
story
could
not
have
been
meaningfully
reported
without
his
inclusion
whether
there
was
something
about
it.
how
could
you
report
the
georgia
--
university
of
georgia
football
story
without
referring
to
the
coach?
clearly,
general
walker’s
involvement
was
at
the
most
important
news
worthiness
and
it
said
here
is
a
man
who
had
been
a
commander
in
germany,
who
had
been
at
little
rock
at
the
time
of
the
integration
desegregation
of
central
high
school
and
who
had
been
on
television
a
week
before
in
dallas
and
advising
governor
osborn,
they
don’t
have
the
act.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
person
has
an
identification
in
the
public
view,
in
the
community
involved,
among
the
people
whom
he
is
defamed
that
makes
his
inclusion
in
the
story
news
worthy.
now,
here
there
were
many
other
people
arrested,
they
are
not
mentioned
by
wip
just
george
a.
rosenbloom.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
i
think
so.
i
say
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
have
reported
the
story
on
the
university
of
georgia
without
--
and
the
football
team
and
the
allegations
there
as
to
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
maybe
more
so
in
the
some
parts
of
the
country.
mr.
ramsey
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
defamation
suit
brought
under
the
laws
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
the
united
stated
district
court,
jurisdiction
being
on
its
diversity.
before
stating
the
facts,
let
me
state
the
question
briefly.
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
of
course
began
to
apply
the
first
amendment
to
the
laws
of
defamation
and
libel
which
had
interfered
historically.
it
began
in
that
area
of
conduct
of
public
officials
engaging
in
official
conduct
and
said
that
“only
where
an
actual
malice
can
be
shown,
can
the
state
statutes
permitting
recovery
for
defamation
applied”
otherwise
there’ll
be
a
chilling
effect,
there
will
not
be
adequate
breathing
room
for
freedom
of
speech.
the
question
here
is
whether
that
rule
is
to
be
extended
to
the
very
private
individual
to
the
200
million
americans
who
are
not
famous,
who
are
not
public
officials,
and
who
are
not
public
figures
such
as
coach
butch
or
general
edwin
walker,
who
are
just
plain
people
engaging
in
ordinary
life.
this
petitioner,
george
a.
rosenbloom,
was
a
successful
salesman
for
the
major
magazine
and
book
distributor
in
the
united
states.
in
that
capacity
in
1962,
he
was
offered
a
major
distributorship
for
american
outdoor
publishing
corporation
which
publishes
nudist
magazines.
he
carefully
considered
because
he
was
a
man
concerned,
as
the
record
shows
about
his
reputation,
whether
to
take
this
opportunity.
he
even
consulted
a
lawyer.
he
was
advised
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
held
that
these
publications
were
legal
and
after
many
months
on
the
first
of
may,
he
accepted
the
distributorship
and
became
the
distributor
in
the
philadelphia
area
for
this
publishing
company.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
emphasis
arises
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
emphasis
arises
from
what
i
believe
is
the
constitutional
and
certainly
the
national
concern
for
reputation.
here
was
a
man
that
was
concerned
about
his
reputation.
this
is
a
defamation
action,
and
as
the
facts
were
disclosed,
a
jury
found
he
was
defamed
and
he
was
a
man
who
was
cautious
enough
before
getting
into
this
business
to
be
sure
that
it
was
a
proper
business,
a
legal
business
and
it
happened
to
be
a
business
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
itself
had
reviewed
and
upheld.
on
october
the
1st
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
certainly
bears
on
that,
yes.
it
bears
also
on
his
care
for
his
reputation
too,
which
i
think
is
important.
on
the
1st
of
october
in
1963,
there
were
series
of
raids
on
newsstands
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
by
the
city
police.
on
that
day,
approximately
20
newsstands
employees
were
arrested.
this
petitioner,
george
rosenbloom
who
happened
to
be
making
a
delivery
of
his
magazines
at
one
at
the
time
was
also
arrested.
and
on
october
the
4th
of
1963,
there
begun
a
series
of
more
than
21
broadcast
in
which
this
respondent
here
referred
to
him
in
his
business,
this
first
broadcast
which
came
over
the
air
at
6
pm
on
october
the
4th
begun
city
cracks
down
on
smut
merchants.
there
had
been
7
or
8
arrests
on
october
the
4th
and
on
that
day
the
wip,
the
metromedia
station
philadelphia
now
says
mr.
rosenbloom’s
home
had
been
raided.
they
gave
his
whole
name
and
his
address.
they
referred
to
no
other
one
else
arrested.
they
stated
they
had
been
confiscated
at
his
home
1000
magazines
and
that
he
had
been
arrested
on
the
charge
of
possession
of
obscene
literature.
in
addition,
it
stated
that
a
barn
that
he
rented
had
been
raided,
and
there
were
confiscated
obscene
books.
it
did
not
say
allegedly
obscene
books,
it
said
obscene
books.
it
said
too
that
captain
ferguson
who
was
in
charge
of
special
investigating
unit
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
at
that
time
believed
the
police
had
hit
the
supply
of
the
main
distributor
of
obscene
material
in
the
philadelphia
area.
the
second
--
they
were
broadcast
through
that
night
through
the
next
day
that
repeated
generally
this.
the
word
allegedly
obscene
books
was
added
in
some
subsequent
broadcast.
a
second
series
of
broadcast
begun
on
october
21st,
repeated
in
variations
on
the
25th
and
on
november
the
1st.
these
addressed
themselves
to
a
lawsuit
that
the
petitioner
here
had
filed
to
enjoin
the
police
department
and
the
newspaper
and
radio
station
in
philadelphia
from
harassment
interfering
with
his
business.
it
did
not
endeavor
to
enjoin
generally
their
conduct,
but
only
insofar
as
he
was
concerned.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
sir.
this
was
a
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
record
doesn’t
show.
the
last
reference
in
the
record
indicates
that
the
judge
would
decide
next
week.
this
damage
suit
filed
later
and
came
up
before
the
same
judge,
judge
joseph
lord
iii
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
the
broadcast
characterized
plaintiffs
as
smut
distributors,
girly
book
peddlers
and
as
attempting
to
the
force
--
to
force
the
defendants,
which
included
the
chief
of
police
and
the
newspapers
and
radio
stations
to
lay
off
the
smut
literature
racket.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
think
the
characterization
by
its
choice,
by
the
radio
station
of
these
materials
as
obscene
is
certainly
a
major
element,
but
there
many
other
elements.
i
think
to
have
relied
upon
the
captain
of
police
who
had
phoned
this
in
under
the
impression
that
he
had
some
duty
to
inform
the
public.
in
other
words,
in
contrast
to
sullivan
v.
new
york
times,
here
you
have
sullivan
calling
new
york
times
and
giving
them
a
story
about
some
fellow
out
in
the
street,
and
as
the
fellow
out
in
the
street
in
this
situation
who
is
not
known
to
anybody.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
i
would
agree
with
judge
lord
that
the
editorialization
and
the
sensational
way
in
which
they
characterized
his
conduct
would
be
defamatory.
i
think
it
would
diminish
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
man,
and
i
think
it
would
damage
his
business
as
certainly
this
damaged
his
business
very
severely.
he
lost
34
out
of
60
accounts
that
he’d
been
able
to
build
up,
and
he
went
out
of
business
in
fact.
the
other
things
that
were
said
that
would
add
to
that
of
course,
that
he
was
the
main
distributor
of
obscene
material
in
philadelphia,
and
i
was
relying
on
captain
ferguson
perhaps,
but
do
they
really
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
him
without
any
examination.
is
this
going
to
protect
free
speech,
or
is
it
really
going
to
interfere
with
free
speech
when
the
police
use
the
press
as
an
extension
of
their
enforcement
arm,
or
vice
versa?
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
an
important
element,
yes
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
defamatory
nature
of
that
is
certainly
perfectly
clear
to
me.
i
think
there
could
be
very
little
doubt
about
it,
but
the
impression
too
that
he
is
trying
to
get
to
prevent
law
enforcement
from
doing
its
duty,
so
to
speak,
to
lay
off
the
smut
literature
racket
is
just
erroneous.
he
was
just
trying
to
protect
his
own
interest
as
a
businessman,
as
a
successful
small
business
man
in
these
sales.
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
raid
was
on
the
day
of
the
4th,
october
the
4th
and
the
first
broadcast
was
at
6
p.m.
on
the
4th.
now
in
the
subsequent
broadcast,
because
this
went
on
from
october
4
through
november
1,
the
first
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
sir.
october
4th,
5th,
october
21,
25
and
november
1,
but
they’re
over
21
different
broadcast
going
out
to
the
entire
radio
audience
in
that
metropolitan
area.
of
course
mr.
rosenbloom
can’t
have
every
radio
station
on.
he
doesn’t
really
find
out
until
people
tell
him
what
been
said
about
him,
and
he
has
to
go
down
to
confirm
it.
but
there
was
a
delay
of
more
than
a
week
from
the
time
he
filed
his
injunction
suit
trying
to
prevent
harassment
and
interference
with
his
lawful
business
and
the
time
that
the
second
series,
as
we’ve
described
in
the
litigation
of
these
broadcast
began
on
october
21.
so
it
could
hardly
be
called
hot
news.
a
week
had
gone
by
before
they
came
on
and
characterized
him
as
a
smut
distributor
and
a
girly
book
peddler
and
attempting
to
force
the
police
and
the
district
attorney
to
lay
off
smut
literature
racket.
on
october
27,
mr.
rosenbloom
went
to
the
radio
station.
he
had
heard
this.
the
people
were
complaining
to
him
as
the
records
show,
the
people
he
sold
to.
his
friends
wouldn’t
talk
to
him,
and
he
asked
to
see
copies
or
to
hear
some
of
the
broadcast.
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
anybody.
this
is
the
plight
of
someone
trying
to
engage
in
robust
dispute
in
mass
society
with
the
media,
but
he
was
put
on
the
phone
with
a
part
time
employee
who
dug
up
one
of
the
tapes
and
played
it
back
to
him.
mr.
rosenbloom
protested
that
the
supreme
court
had
said
that
this
material
was
not
obscene.
the
individual
who
was
working
for
the
radio
station
said
the
da
had
said
it
was
obscene
and
mr.
rosenbloom
replied
that
the
da
had
said
in
fact
that
it
was
legal
and
at
that
time
they
hung
up
on
him
as
the
extent
of
his
opportunity
to
speak
out.
wally
butts
can
get
on
television
as
he
did,
general
edwin
walker
is
on
television
before
he
leaves
dallas
to
go
to
oxford,
mississippi,
a
judge
telling
the
public
what
it
ought
to
do
because
he’s
a
public
figure.
george
a.
rosenbloom
is
like
most
people
in
this
world,
the
overwhelming
majority,
not
a
public
figure.
the
jury
charge
said
that
there
be
four
elements
in
the
proof
of
defamation
for
general
damages.
first
that
there
was
harm
to
the
reputation
of
the
plaintiff
that
it
lowered
him
in
the
estimation
of
his
peers
and
that
it
deterred
third
persons
from
engaging
in
commerce
with
him.
second
that
the
allegations
that
were
made
could
reasonably
be
taken
to
refer
to
the
plaintiff
while
his
name
and
his
address
given
in
this
case.
third,
that
the
people
exercised
reasonable
care
to
determine
the
truth
of
what
they
were
saying
in
for
which
they
were
sued
and
fourth
that
it
was
false.
to
recover
punitive
damages,
it
was
required
that
malice
be
shown
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
and
the
malice
charge
there
roughly
was
that
it
was
published
or
caused
to
be
broadcast
with
the
bad
motive
or
reckless
indifference
to
the
rights
of
others.
the
jury
came
in,
the
judge
--
well
first
the
jury
came
in
with
a
verdict
of
general
damages
in
the
amount
of
$25,000.00
and
punitive
damages
in
the
amount
of
$725,000.00.
the
jury
had
seen
some
of
the
magazines.
the
judge
required
a
remitature
of
$500,000.00
but
he
found
that
malice
was
present
that
there
were
at
least
three
substantial
indications
of
it
in
the
record,
and
that
the
defendant
there
had
broadcast
in
a
sensational
way
and
in
an
editorializing
way
about
the
rights
of
this
private
citizen.
he
refused
to
apply
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
because
he
felt
that
it
applied
only
to
public
officials
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
individuals.
that
the
first
amendment
protection
was
intended
to
protect
the
processes
of
government
and
the
conduct
of
government
officials,
the
elective
process
and
such
things
and
did
not
intend
to
permit
people
to
defame
the
private
citizen
in
america
and
destroy
some
of
the
quality
of
his
life,
only
if
he
could
show
that
there
was
actual
malice
in
a
broadcast.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
basis
of
new
york
times.
the
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ramsey
clark
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
say
a
word
to
about
the
facts
first.
i
don’t
argue
facts,
the
record
can
speak
for
itself,
but
some
of
views
indicated
in
the
nature
of
the
argument
and
rebuttal.
mr.
segal
complaints
about
our
reference
to
a
headline,
there
has
been
no,
on
this
broadcast,
there
has
been
no
complaint
about
reference
to
headline
before,
it’s
clearly
in
the
record,
page
26a,
it’s
in
our
briefs
as
testified
to
at
the
trial
and
it
characterized
the
nature
of
the
broadcast.
he
complaints
about
our
describing
the
broadcast
to
series,
they
were
clearly
series,
they
would
go
on
every
30
minutes
after
they
began.
i
described
them
as
a
single
series,
but
its
two
series
that
over
a
period
of
time
occupied
almost
a
month
beginning
october
4
and
5
and
picking
up
again
october
21,
going
to
november
1.
i
think
his
reference
to
the
record
where
mr.
rosenbloom
met
someone
in
a
café
who
describe
the
broadcast
that
he
heard
and
his
reaction
shows
the
real
problem
of
a
little
man.
if
you’re
edwin
walker
or
if
you’re
wally
butts
or
someone
and
there
is
something
derogatory
said
about
you,
your
phone
rings
all
night,
the
press
wants
to
get
your
views
about
it,
they’re
anxious
to
hear
from
you.
if
you’re
george
a.
rosenbloom,
nobody
calls.
you
find
out
from
your
friends.
you
find
out
when
you
go
back
around
to
serve
some
account
and
they
won’t
buy
it
from
you
anymore.
you
find
out
you’re
ruined
and
then
you
got
to
find
out
why
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
do
it
on
your
own
because
you’re
a
little
man
and
nobody
is
going
to
take
care
of
you,
you
are
not
allowed
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
equal
time
theory
and
the
law
shows
that
we
are
prepared
to
require
the
radio
to
try
to
be
fair,
but
equal
time
refers
to
opinion
to
raise,
the
editorialization
of
this
did
smack
of
sensationalism
and
the
views
of
the
trial
judge
and
of
editorializing,
but
i
don’t
think
that
there
has
been
any
extension
of
equal
time
to
the
ideas
obtained
in
news
reporting,
people
as
to
whom
news
is
reported
have
an
opportunity
to
come
on
in
and
say
something
if
a
commentator
has
an
editorial
and
he
discusses
you
or
an
issue
then
you
have
an
opportunity,
but
certainly
within
my
experience,
there
has
been
no
equal
opportunity
time
on
fact
news
broadcasting
and
i’m
not
sure
how
you
would
function
with
something
like
that.
mr.
rosenbloom
couldn’t
even
get
them
to
discuss
the
issue
with
him,
how
he
would
have
gotten
in,
i
mean
they
hung
up
on
him,
that’s
how
he
can
reach
the
metromedia
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
(inaudible)
is
coming
and
reporters
find,
my
understanding
of
his
comment
was,
if
the
reporters
find
that
people
who
are
charged
with
crime
don’t
want
to
discuss
that
with
them,
their
lawyers
advises
them
not
to
discuss
that
with
them
and
that
maybe
generally
true,
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
law
that
indicates
that
there
is
a
right
to
equal
time
for
news
broadcasting,
but
even
if
there
were,
i
think
mr.
rosenbloom
quite
as
clearly
illustrated
in
this
situation,
you
know
mr.
segal
says
it
was
october
21
when
he
first
discovered
about
the
broadcast,
that
doesn’t
mean
he
wasn’t
hurt,
he
was
deeply
and
desperately
hurt,
but
how
could
he
know,
he
can’t
listen
to
every
radio
stations
broadcasting,
how
is
he
going
to
find
out.
he
finds
out
when
somebody
tells
him,
and
then
he
goes
down
and
he
tries
to
talk
as
a
little
man
at
the
people
at
the
station,
they
get
a
part
time
man
to
talk
to
him
on
a
telephone
that
he
can’t
even
see
and
that
person
hangs
up.
it’s
very
important
too
i
think
that
we
realize
if
this
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
a
single
charge.
there
was
no
effort
by
the
defense
in
the
trial
of
this
case
to
say
was
this
allegation
true
or
false
or
obscene,
it
was
all
submitted
on
a
single
charge,
the
whole
period
of
time.
had
there
been
some
distinction
there
then
i
think
maybe
this
court
could
try
to
make
some
distinctions
between
the
separate
allegations
but
when
you
take
them
all
as
a
whole,
they
wind
up
leaving
the
impression
that
the
man
in
the
café
who
gave
to
george
rosenbloom,
they
want
to
lock
that
guy
up
and
throw
the
key
away,
and
that’s
the
best
that
he
can
find
out
as
an
individual.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no,
the
libel
is
to
be
evaluated
on
what
the
jury
had
before
it
in
the
record,
all
these
material.
i’m
just
saying
that
they
could
--
that
the
impression
that
was
left
as
the
trial
judge
showed
in
his
opinion,
i
didn’t
say
just
charge
the
jury,
he
didn’t
say
anything
about
retraction
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
that
all
came
after
the
jury
verdict
when
he
wrote
his
opinion.
mr.
ramsey
clark
apparently
there
was
no
objection
to
it
and
certainly
respondent
shows
no
concern
about
this
time
because
he’s
the
one
that
injects
it
in
this
hearing
not
us.
but
i
assume
it
was
to
show
how
it
was
that
mr.
rosenbloom
came
to
inquire
of
the
radio
station,
why
he
went
down
to
the
radio
station
to
see
what
they
had
played.
it’s
very
interesting
to
note
too
that
there
are
eight
women
on
this
jury
that
they
saw
that
magazine
and
we
can
tell
what
impression
it
had
on
them
by
the
verdict
they
gave.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes
sir.
let
me
now
state
again
my
view
of
the
law,
before
i
do
it,
i
think
it’s
important
to
realize
that
mr.
rosenbloom
was
put
out
of
business.
he
lost
34
of
60
accounts
right
away
and
he
subsequently
had
to
go
out
of
business.
i
think
there’s
going
to
have
to
be
some
lines
your
honor
on
new
york
times
and
i
think
the
first
amendment
will
require
these
things.
where
the
discussion
is
of
an
issue
that
it
be
uninhibited,
robust,
wide
open,
you
can
discuss
nudism,
you
can
discuss
magazine
distribution.
that
to
have
actionable
defamation
of
a
public
official
or
a
public
figure
because
public
figures
are
part
of
the
story,
they’re
part
of
the
process
of
learning
the
truth,
they
can
be
the
done
only
where
there’s
actual
malice,
only
where
there
is
actual
malice
can
recovery
be
made
for
defamatory
action.
but
where
you
come
to
the
individual,
the
private
person
who
has
no
chance
to
engage
really
in
robust
or
wide
open
discussion
of
these
issues
with
metromedia,
that
the
power
of
technology
and
communication,
the
power
to
debate
these
issues
in
the
marketplace
of
public
opinion
for
private
citizens
in
this
country
is
very,
very
limited
and
they
can
be
crashed
as
well
as
mr.
rosenbloom.
so,
actionable
defamation
of
a
purely
private
person
such
as
he
can
be
maintained
only
where
there
is
a
lack
of
reasonable
care,
that
happened
to
be
the
pennsylvania
standard.
that
was
the
standard
that
was
applied
here,
but
to
support
the
punitive
damages,
there
was
also
a
charge
of
malice
and
the
jury
found
actionable
damages
and
it
found
malice
under
the
pennsylvania
law
and
that
charge
was
very
similar
to
the
charge
in
the
butts
case
and
as
you
know
the
butts
case,
the
recovery
was
allowed
to
stand,
i
think
that
would
be
fair
here
because
there
was
no
way
for
the
attorney
for
mr.
rosenbloom
at
that
time
to
ever
believe
that
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
could
be
extended
from
the
commissioner
of
police
in
montgomery
county
to
george
a.
rosenbloom
when
he
was
confronted
by
both
the
police
and
the
press
in
opposition
to
his
livelihood.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
my
opinion
of
where
the
law
ought
to
go,
it’s
not
there
at
this
time
in
my
judgment.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
don’t
argue
that.
i
think
timely
heal
shows
the
problems
there
but
i
think
there’s
immense
difference
between
defamation
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
sir,
i’m
really
arguing
for
the
constitutional
rule
that
you’ve
expressed
in
at
least
two
opinions
that
negligence
be
the
standard
where
it’s
a
private
individual.
but
as
to
the
masses
of
our
people,
they
don’t
have
no
opportunity
to
really
debate,
there
is
no
marketplace
in
which
their
opinions
can
be
tested
against
metromedia,
and
therefore,
anyone
who
will
defame
them
must
use
reasonable
care
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
what
he
says.
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
truth.
mr.
ramsey
clark
it
would
fall
within
what
i
would
consider
an
acceptable
federal
constitutional
rule
and
therefore
it
would
be
any
lesser
rule
within
the
state
wanted
to
impose
would
be
adequate,
but
this
rule
requires
reasonable
care
even
for
the
private
citizen
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
is
any
rule
that
didn’t
impinge
more
greatly
on
free
speech,
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that
was
perhaps
be
my
argument
as
an
advocate
in
this
case
that
mr.
rosenbloom’s
judgment
here
would
be
affirmed
under
any
of
those
tests.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
my
view
as
a
lawyer,
my
view
as
a
lawyer
is
that
the
constitution
does
provide
some
protection
to
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
discussion
even
of
the
little
people,
that
that
is
important
to
the
discovery
of
truth
too
but
where
you
are
going
to
discuss
the
little
people,
you’re
going
to
have
to
exercise
reasonable
care.
and
because
the
little
man
can’t
show
actual
malice,
how
can
george
rosenbloom
show
that
there
was
actual
malice
in
metromedia,
they
never
heard
of
him
before,
they
don’t
know
and
they
never
met
him,
he
can’t
see
them
face
to
face,
he
has
to
talk
to
them
over
telephone.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes
it
would
mr.
justice.
my
view
is
the
central
purpose
as
you
stated
so
beautifully
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
activities
of
government,
that
they
really
be
open
to
full
vigorous
discussion
and
debate
so
that
the
truth
maybe
known,
but
there’s
some
value
to
in
discussion
in
knowing
the
little
things
about
little
people,
but
if
you
discuss
them
in
a
way
that
does
more
than
invades
their
privacy,
that
actually
defames
them
and
injures
them
and
puts
them
out
of
business,
you’re
going
to
have
to
use
reasonable
care,
because
we
do
have
that
regard
for
the
individual
here
too.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
don’t
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
case
here
and
i’m
sure
that
it
won’t
feel
that
duty
itself.
in
my
judgment
though,
the
discussion
of
the
issue
is
valuable,
that’s
how
you
find
the
truth
and
we
need
to
have
some
room
there,
but
we
do
need
to
have
reasonable
care
because
it’s
awfully
important
that
press
have
exercise
care
too
with
the
concentration
we
have
there.
if
there
is
no
standard
of
care,
if
we
have
to
show
actual
malice,
how
will
get
excellence
to
professionalism
in
our
effort
to
report
the
truth.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
your
honor,
i
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
truth.
i
think
discussion
has
to
have
wide
breathing
room
and
certainly
everything
i’ve
tried
to
argue
indicates
that,
but
there’s
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
says
you
can
--
that
our
purpose
is
to
permit
untruthful
statement,
purposeful
untruthful
statements,
malicious
statements.
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
truth,
to
be
sure
that
the
truth
can
be
discovered
because
it’s
very
difficult
to
find,
we
have
to
give
it
a
wide,
wide
breathing
room,
where
public
officials
or
public
figures
are
involved,
actual
malice
should
be
the
rule,
as
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in
butts
and
walker
and
new
york
times.
but
when
it’s
a
private
individual,
if
you
feel
you
have
to
comment
on
them
rather
than
issues
which
they’re
engaged
in,
and
you
can
have
a
very
vigorous
discussion
of
the
issues
without
defaming
an
individual,
but
if
you
go
to
the
private
individual,
then
you
must
use
reasonable
care.
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
cherish
for
your
speech
and
it
think
that
is
indicated
here.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
the
fact
that
the
defendants
did
not
ask
for
special
charges
or
special
instructions
or
special
findings
on
the
various
broadcast
indicates
that
the
court
will
have
to
look
at
the
thing
as
a
whole
too.
as
i’m
sure
some
of
the
customers,
the
buyers
from
mr.
rosenbloom
did,
because
they
heard
them
all
and
they
knew
that
this
was
mr.
rosenbloom
that
they
knew.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
think
we’ve
sustained
verdicts
of
that
dimension.
i
think
it’s
impressive
that
the
jury
felt
that
an
individual
had
been
so
offended.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
true
and
i
think
the
biggest
verdict
of
all
was
in
the
butts
case
which
this
court
permitted
to
stand.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
that
maybe
somewhat
implicit
there,
we
talked
about
free
speech
and
we
talk
about
free
press.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
they’re
both
valuable
and
important,
and
i
think
that
reasonable
care
though
where
the
private
individual
is
concerned
in
mass
society,
it’s
going
to
be
essential
to
human
dignity.
i
just
don’t
how
the
little
man
can
survive
if
the
press
decides
to
go
after
him,
you’ll
never
show
actual
malice.
mr.
ramsey
clark
or
the
little
woman.
[laughter]
mr.
ramsey
clark
we
need
a
word
that
covers
both
or
a
little
yet
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
next
sentence
your
honor
says
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
first
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
first
two
sentences
would
probably
be
alright
under
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
think
they’re
reporting
a
new
story,
the
police
did
do
these
things.
the
second
too
involved
quite
different
considerations
but
the
headline
begins
with
the
characterization
of
smuts
--
scratch
down
on
smut
merchants,
there
were
on
that
day
seven
or
eight
arrests,
the
material
seized
on
october
1,
mr.
rosenbloom
were
only
a
small
part,
a
very
small
part
of
the
material
seized.
there
were
twenty
people
arrested
that
day.
in
this
enlargement
of
his
role,
this
characterization
of
him
is
not
going
to
raise
him
in
the
esteem
of
his
customers
or
his
fellow
man.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
listener
having
heard
the
george
a.
rosenbloom
and
hearing
this
all
around
together
is
going
to
assume
that
they’re
talking
about
anyone
else.
we
have,
i
think
even
mr.
segal
said
if
you
take
that
sounds
out
of
context
but
can
we
really
assume
that
the
radio
audience
takes
it
out
of
context?
you’re
driving
along
in
your
car
and
you
hear
george
a.
rosenbloom
and
they’ve
seized
3,000
obscene
books
and
they’re
cracking
down
on
smut
merchants.
mr.
ramsey
clark
for
the
actual
damages
or
general
damages
as
they’re
called
in
pennsylvania
$25,000.00
and
the
punitive
damages
as
reduced
by
remittitur
to
$250,000.00.
mr.
ramsey
clark
no
sir.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
your
honor,
we
haven’t
really
raised
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
the
power
of
the
court
to
reduce
it
and
if
--
or
in
the
court
below
so
if
that’s
something
is
really
not
here
on
the
record,
the
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
i
imagine
there
are
your
honor.
that
was
a
ruling
of
the
trial
court
and
it’s
here
without
objection
at
this
level.
mr.
ramsey
clark
that’s
the
status
of
the
case
in
this
posture,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ramsey
clark
i
think
we
would
have
an
obligation
to
raise
that
as
a
basis
for
our
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
i
haven’t
really
considered
that
your
honor,
and
i
think
i
would
have
to,
to
be
helpful
to
the
court.
that
maybe
something
down
the
road,
if
i
don’t
think
you
can
embrace
free
speech
i
think
we
have
to
live
by
the
first
amendment,
in
fact,
we
would
be
a
lot
better
of
if
we
insist
on
it.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
there
maybe
another
test,
the
only
other
test
i
can
see
is
the
newsworthy
test
or
the
issue
test,
and
i
don’t
believe
distinctions
can
be
made
there.
i
think
when
the
news
broadcast
something
it
is
ipso
facto
news
worthy.
and
i
think
really
what
defamation
is
all
about
is
people
and
reputations
and
that’s
where
the
hard
line
will
have
to
be
drawn
between
the
private
people.
they
were
not
within
the
original
contemplation
really
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
sense,
we’re
not
scrutinizing
the
conduct
of
public
officials
here
and
the
mass
power
of
media
that
they
can’t
answer
or
really
debate
with.
mr.
ramsey
clark
well,
at
first,
if
he’s
a
public
official,
i
think
that's
pretty
clear.
i
think
if
he
is
a
public
figure
then
the
test
might
be
whether
his
history
has
been
such
that
the
story
could
not
have
been
meaningfully
reported
without
his
inclusion
whether
there
was
something
about
it.
how
could
you
report
the
georgia
--
university
of
georgia
football
story
without
referring
to
the
coach?
clearly,
general
walker’s
involvement
was
at
the
most
important
news
worthiness
and
it
said
here
is
a
man
who
had
been
a
commander
in
germany,
who
had
been
at
little
rock
at
the
time
of
the
integration
desegregation
of
central
high
school
and
who
had
been
on
television
a
week
before
in
dallas
and
advising
governor
osborn,
they
don’t
have
the
act.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
person
has
an
identification
in
the
public
view,
in
the
community
involved,
among
the
people
whom
he
is
defamed
that
makes
his
inclusion
in
the
story
news
worthy.
now,
here
there
were
many
other
people
arrested,
they
are
not
mentioned
by
wip
just
george
a.
rosenbloom.
mr.
ramsey
clark
yes,
i
think
so.
i
say
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
have
reported
the
story
on
the
university
of
georgia
without
--
and
the
football
team
and
the
allegations
there
as
to
--
mr.
ramsey
clark
well
maybe
more
so
in
the
some
parts
of
the
country.
