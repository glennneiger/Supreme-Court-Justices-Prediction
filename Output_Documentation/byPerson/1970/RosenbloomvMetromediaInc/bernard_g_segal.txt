mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
it
please
the
court.
first
is
i
am
sure
the
court
would
know,
i
should
like
to
say
that
i
do
not
agree
at
all
with
my
friend
mr.
clark
with
the
question
here
is
whether
new
york
times
and
i
assume
he
would
include
though
he
did
not
say
butts
and
walker
in
the
rest
of
the
line
are
to
be
extended
i
quote
him
to
200
million
plain
people
engaging
in
ordinary
life.
that
is
not
the
question
on
which
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted.
it
is
not
the
question
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
it
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
further,
i
say
with
full
difference
that
i
do
not
agree
either
with
the
sketch
of
the
facts
presented
by
mr.
clark,
i
must
say
that
some
critical
facts
aren’t
exactly
stated
and
other
critical
facts
are
omitted.
therefore,
i
feel
called
upon
as
i
had
not
originally
intended
to
go
into
the
facts
with
the
court
particularly
since
in
the
cases
i
have
referred
to
this
court
has
adopted
the
salutary
policy
of
reviewing
de
novo
the
cases
to
find
whether
the
standard
for
constitutional
protection
pronounced
by
the
court
has
been
met
in
the
opinion
below
whether
jury
or
court.
in
the
first
place,
we
are
--
mr.
clark
creates
an
erroneous
impression
when
he
says
that
there
was
a
series
of
21
broadcasts,
a
series
of
21
broadcasts
on
wip
about
mr.
rosenbloom,
there
was
no
series
at
all.
we’re
not
dealing
here
with
a
feature
story,
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
documentary,
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
campaign
and
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
crusade,
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
series.
we’re
dealing
with
statements
which
occupied
one
sentence
to
four
sentences
at
the
maximum
in
newscasts
by
a
highly
oriented
station
which
every
half
hour
of
the
day,
24
hours
a
day,
48
times
a
day,
320
times
a
week,
every
week
of
the
year,
everyday
of
the
year,
broadcasts
every
half
hour
of
the
year,
and
every
statement
before
your
honor
fills
that
category.
it’s
a
one
sentence
statement
or
two
sentence
statement
or
a
four
sentence
statement
and
there
is
no
longer
one
there.
now,
the
second
thing
my
friend
mr.
clark
did
is
he
began
with
the
statement
of
facts
which
said
that
on
october
1st,
there
were
arrests,
20
of
them
he
said,
mr.
rosenbloom
was
one.
well,
they
were
news
dealers,
they
were
store
operators
and
they
were
distributor
who
supplied
these
store
operators
and
news
dealers,
mr.
rosenbloom.
and
then
he
says
the
next
to
that
was
on
october
4,
when
wip
had
a
broadcast
to
which
he
objects.
well,
your
honor,
a
great,
great
deal
happened
between
october
1
and
october
4,
to
which
mr.
clark
did
not
advert.
what
happened
here
is
that
is
a
result
of
complains
from
the
public,
and
after
a
two-month
investigation,
mr.
howard
leri,
not
captain
ferguson,
mr.
howard
leri
i
think
acknowledged
this
perhaps
at
that
time
america’s
leading
police
commissioner,
later
commissioner
in
new
york,
ordered
the
arrests
by
captain
ferguson
and
he
ordered
the
crackdown
on
what
he
then
regarded
as
obscene
material.
i
might
say
to
your
honors
that
mr.
clark
has
made
a
good
deal
of
captain
ferguson’s
definition
and
has
ridiculed
it
and
has
said
that
this
would
make
the
finest
paintings
in
the
museum
obscene.
but
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
just
a
few
years
ago,
few
years
before
that,
we’re
now
talking
about
talking
about
1963,
a
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
state
of
washington
gave
that
precise
definition
of
what
he
thought
a
majority
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
washington
considered
obscene
and
a
very
advertent
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
consisting
of
three
judges,
everyone
of
whom
served
as
a
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit,
affirmed
on
the
opinion
below
stating
that
the
judge
had
found
the
facts.
so
there
isn’t
any
shocking
finding
here,
it
was
erroneous,
erroneous
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
well,
on
october
1st,
when
the
arrest
came,
all
of
the
city
newspapers
had
headlines
about
it
and
necessarily
headlines
about
mr.
rosenbloom
who
was
the
supplier,
and
the
station
cbs
tv
had
headlines
about
it
and
that
happened
on
the
first
and
it
happened
on
the
second
and
it
happened
on
the
third
and
they
are
events
to
which
mr.
clark
did
not
have
heard.
and
those
newspaper
articles
and
that
cbs
tv
telecast
said
that
mr.
rosenbloom’s
products
were
smut
and
were
obscene.
and
what
did
mr.
rosenbloom
do
about
that?
i
mentioned
just
in
passing
he
brought
a
lawsuit
about
two
weeks
later
and
he
didn’t
name
wip
in
that
lawsuit.
i’m
going
to
show
he
didn’t
know
there
was
a
broadcast
in
wip
until
october
27th,
weeks
later,
didn’t
even
know
there
was
a
broadcast,
but
he
brought
a
suit
against
all
of
the
newspapers,
against
the
police
commissioner,
against
the
district
attorney,
one
for
a
million
dollars
in
damages
and
against
cbs
tv,
not
wip,
one
for
a
million
dollars
in
damages
and
the
second
to
enjoin
the
police
commissioner
and
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
him
for
criminal
violation
of
the
obscenity
law
and
against
the
newspapers
for
calling
his
products
smut
and
obscene
and
calling
him
a
smut
peddler
and
a
peddler
of
obscene
material.
did
not
name
wip
and
he
averred
there
that
so
great
was
his
damage
by
virtue
of
those
broadcasts
by
those
people
that
all,
nearly
all
of
his
costumers
as
the
language
his
used,
nearly
all
of
his
costumers
returned
all
of
his
material
to
him
which
he
had
supplied
to
them.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
suit
was
a
suit
for
defamation
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
for
injunction.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
damage
i
would
say
--
it’s
a
little
hard
to
tell
your
honor
but
i’d
say
it
had
to
be
defamation
because
i
don’t
know
what
else
it
could
be.
it’s
not
a
complaint
grounded
elegantly
for
libel
but
i
think
it
is.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
outcome
of
the
suit
your
honor
is
that
shortly
after
november
1,
when
we
broadcast
an
innocuous
statement
that
the
judge
would
decide
in
10
or
11
days,
he
did
decide,
he
dismissed
as
to
all
of
the
newspapers,
he
dismissed
as
to
cbs
tv
and
a
little
later
he
dismissed
as
to
the
two
city
officials.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that’s
the
end
of
those
suits.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
a
federal
court
suit.
i
might
say
to
you
your
honors
that
it
was
because
of
that,
that
judge
lord
ruled
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
recover
special
damages
against
wip
for
any
loss
of
business
at
any
kind.
he
said
he
has
no
right
to
special
damages.
now
i
suggest
the
allowance
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
might
say
to
you
your
honor
that
though
our
friends
on
the
other
side
have
the
strongest
condemnation
for
our
newscaster
because
he
confused
the
judges.
my
distinguished
friend
did
the
same
yesterday
when
he
said
they
were
the
same,
they’re
different.
the
judge
who
heard
this
case
is
judge
john
lord,
that
is
the
complaint.
the
judge
who
heard
this
case
is
judge
joseph
s.
lord.
judge
john
lord
has
since
become
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
and
it
has
been
good
deal
of
amusement
at
our
bar
of
constant
confusion.
well
now,
what
then
happened?
on
october
4th,
mr.
rosenbloom
was
rearrested
and
that
was
the
day
of
the
first
broadcast
of
which
my
friends
complained
about
wip.
now,
i’d
like
to
get
one
thing
straightened
out.
my
friend
says
that
there
was
a
headline
to
that
broadcast
which
read
“city
cracks
down
on
smut
merchants”.
i
submit
to
you
your
honors
he’s
in
error.
in
the
first
place,
the
station
doesn’t
have
headlines
and
i’ve
asked
my
friend,
one
of
the
counsel
who
had
all
of
the
original
records
because
the
clerk
had
sent
to
him
for
reasons
neither
he
nor
i
can
understand,
have
asked
him
to
give
one
of
our
boys
who
brought
down
to
me
yesterday
all
of
the
original
records
and
i’m
going
to
submit
them
to
the
clerk.
it
would
show
your
honors
that
most
of
them
don’t
have
anything
about
headlines
and
even
this
one
on
the
front
cover
apparently
for
the
advice
of
the
announcer
is
called
repeating
the
headline
news.
it
was
testified
to
by
nobody
as
having
been
broadcast.
the
manager
said
five
years
later,
he
wouldn’t
say
it
was
or
wasn’t,
but
he
pointed
out
that
on
the
same
day
of
the
broadcast
to
which
i’m
going
to
refer,
the
one
complained
of,
there
was
another
item
in
the
news
about
two
people
unconnected
with
this
crackdown
who
were
arrested
and
held
in
$35,000.00
bail
for
transporting
hardcore
pornography.
he
didn’t
even
know
whether
in
advising
the
newscaster
that
this
was
what
was
in
there
among
the
leading
news,
whether
it
referred
to
the
rosenbloom
group
or
whether
it
referred
to
the
other
group
and
there’s
not
a
word
of
testimony
in
the
record
by
anybody
on
the
subject.
now,
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
offensive
broadcast?
well,
your
honors,
it
consist
of
four
lines,
it’s
pretty
nearly
the
longest
of
them
and
it
says,
here
at
350a
of
the
record,
that
a
jury
of
six
men
and
six
women,
it’s
the
third
paragraph
if
your
honors
are
looking
at
it,
350a,
it
says
a
jury
of
--
it
says
that
the
special
investigation
squad,
it’s
the
second
item,
that
special
investigation
squad
raided
the
home
of
mr.
rosenbloom,
that’s
a
factual
statement.
the
second
is
police
confiscated
1,000
allegedly
obscene
books
at
rosenbloom’s
home
and
arrested
him
on
charges
of
possession
of
obscene
literature.
and
my
friend
say
they
don’t
object
to
that
--
those
two
sentences.
then
comes
the
third,
the
one
they
object
to,
the
special
investigation
squad
also
raided
a
barn
in
the
20
hundred
block
of
welsh
avenue
near
bustleton
and
confiscated
3,000
obscene
books.
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
if
that
is
read
in
context,
then
the
alleged
of
the
pre
proceeding
sentence
applies
there
and
if
it’s
read
out
of
context,
my
friend
mr.
clark
is
again
in
error
in
having
said
expressly
that
this
said
that
mr.
rosenbloom
rented
this
barn,
it
doesn’t.
if
it’s
read
out
of
context,
it
doesn’t
even
apply
to
rosenbloom.
it’s
just
an
independent
barn
at
an
independent
address.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
this
is
page
350a
your
honor,
paragraph
two.
so
read
in
context,
the
word
allegedly
simply
carries
over.
read
out
of
context,
it
doesn’t
apply
to
rosenbloom
at
all,
it
turns
out
later
it
was
rosenbloom’s
barn.
the
final
sentence,
they
don’t
object
to
and
that
is
that
captain
ferguson
says
he
believes
they
have
hit
the
supply
of
a
main
distributor
for
obscene
material
in
philadelphia
and
that’s
the
whole
broadcast
your
honors.
now,
and
then
what
happened?
within
an
hour,
it
was
corrected.
there
were
six
more
broadcasts,
there
was
one
and
a
half
hour
and
then
there
were
six
broadcasts
up
to
8
am
in
the
morning,
every
one
of
them
put
the
word
allegedly
in.
so
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
it’s
quite
turn
at
the
very
worst,
it
was
a
slip
of
the
pen
to
have
let
it
out
and
at
the
very
worst,
it
was
corrected
within
the
hour.
mr.
clark
said
some
of
the
later
broadcast
included
it,
every
one
of
them
starting
with
7
pm,
this
was
a
6
pm
broadcast,
had
the
word
allegedly
in
it.
now,
after
this
series
of
broadcast,
i
emphasize
this
to
your
honors,
there
was
never
again
a
broadcast
that
mentioned
mr.
rosenbloom,
never
again
a
broadcast
that
mentioned
mr.
rosenbloom.
indeed,
there
was
never
again
a
broadcast
on
the
subject
for
17
more
days,
not
till
october
21.
what
happened
was
that
on
october
15,
this
complaint
was
filed,
that
i’ve
told
your
honors
about
in
which
wip
was
not
named,
but
the
suit
drew
no
attention.
for
some
reason
our
friends
chose
not
to
publicize
it.
it
first
public
notice
the
suit
drew
was
on
october
21,
why?
because
on
that
day
the
court
set
it
down
for
hearing,
and
when
the
court
announced
it
was
set
down
for
hearing,
everyone
learned
for
the
first
time,
no
one
knew
about
the
suit's
existence
except
the
plaintiffs
and
presumably
if
the
defendants
were
served,
no
papers
had
been
filed
yet.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
federal
court
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
complaint
was
a
public
document
if
you
went
down
and
looked
at
it.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
you
had
the
right
to
see
it
if
you
knew
it
was
there.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
now,
mr.
clark
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
were
no
broadcasts
that
named
mr.
rosenbloom
after
the
ones
i’ve
told
you
about
starting
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
after
the
one
starting
october
4
and
continuing
through
to
the
next
morning,
announcing
the
arrest.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
right,
8
am,
it
ended.
mr.
clark
said
yesterday
that
this
was
not
hot
news
since
the
complaint
had
been
filed
several
days
before.
well,
i
suggest
to
you
it
was
not
news
at
all
until
october
21
when
people
got
to
know
about
it
and
then
it
surely
was
hot
news
because
it
was
the
first
notice
anyone
had.
now
that,
the
hearing
was
postponed
to
october
25
and
the
next
reference
to
the
case,
now,
there
were
these
broadcasts
on
the
21
saying
the
hearing.
on
october
25
was
the
next
set
of
broadcasts
and
the
last
of
which
complaint
is
made,
there
were
these
three,
the
october
4
arrest,
october
21
case
sat
down
for
argument,
the
court
announced
the
postponement
to
october
25.
and
so
on
that
day
there
are
two
newscasts
reporting
the
developments
on
that
date.
there’s
only
one
other
broadcast
on
november
1
to
which
i
referred
in
reply
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
that
simply
nobody
objects
to
it.
it
said
that
this
alleged
charge
was
to
be
decided
by
the
court
within
10
or
11
days
and
there
it
is.
none
of
these
broadcasts
on
october
21
or
25
named
the
defendants.
if
anyone
had
a
recollection
back
to
october
4
of
this
arrest,
there’s
no
way
he
could
know
whether
it
was
mr.
rosenbloom
or
whether
these
two
other
fellows
who
were
there,
was
announced
were
held
in
$35,000.00
bail
for
the
sale
of
pornographic
literature.
nothing
in
the
record
shows
that
a
single
individual
listened
or
heard
the
wip
broadcast.
we
know
that
after
the
most
offending
of
them,
a
suit
was
filed,
wip
was
not
even
mentioned.
we
know
that
the
plaintiff
said
that
he
never
heard
any
of
the
broadcasts
and
not
a
witness
was
produced
who
heard
any
of
the
broadcasts
to
this
day,
except
one
that
i
want
to
refer
to.
in
just
a
moment.
indeed,
i
think
it
would
be
well
if
i
refer
to
him
right
now,
out
of
the
order
of
my
argument.
mr.
rosenbloom
nor
his
attorney
and
he
obviously
had
an
attorney
very
early
in
this
matter,
ever
contacted
the
station.
they
never
asked
for
a
retraction,
they
never
asked
for
the
right
to
say
anything.
i
think
i
know
why
and
i
think
i’ll
tell
your
honor
why.
there
was
one
contact.
now,
mr.
clark
was
mistaken
as
to
what
brought
about
the
contact.
the
record
is
extremely
clear
on
that
and
has
two
witnesses
on
it.
mr.
clark
said
that
there
were
complaints
from
many
friends
as
to
the
wip
broadcast.
and
so
on
october
27,
he
said,
mr.
rosenbloom
went
to
wip,
was
not
permitted
to
see
anyone,
but
had
one
tape
played
back,
that
isn’t
the
story
in
the
record
at
all.
the
story
in
the
record
is
that
he
went
to
a
restaurant
where
he
met
a
friend
named
chews
(ph)
who
testified.
both
he
and
chews
testified
as
to
this
and
chews
said
to
him,
say
“i
heard
a
broad”,
he
knew
he
was
in
the
magazine
business,
say
“i
heard
a
broadcast”,
they
didn’t
mention
any
names,
“i
heard
a
broadcast
about
somebody
arrested
and
they
said
that
they
ought
to
put
that
guy
in
jail
and
throw
the
key
away”.
first,
let
me
say
there’s
no
such
broadcast
by
wip.
the
every
transcript
of
every
broadcast
was
brought
into
the
room
and
adlibbing
was
testified,
was
not
permitted,
but
he
said
that
he’d
heard
this.
rosenbloom
said
“oh
that’s
me”.
now
i
suggest
to
your
honors
it
probably
wasn’t
our
broadcast
because
if
you
look
at
the
broadcast
on
october
21
and
25,
they
don’t
mention
arrest.
but
nevertheless
this
upset
him
and
he
made
a
beeline
to
the
station,
that’s
what
sent
him
to
the
station.
and
when
he
came
to
the
station,
he
said
he
wanted
to
talk
to
somebody
about
newscasts
and
they
have
a
regular
line
right
in
the
lobby,
right
to
the
newscasters
for
anybody
who
inquires
about
newscasters,
he
wasn’t
denied
anything.
he
was
given
the
line
and
he
called
the
newscaster,
a
man
named
nick
wright,
and
he
said
to
the
newscaster
“i’ve
been
told
there
was
something
about
me
on
wip”.
according
to
the
record,
he
didn’t
tell
him
what
actually
happened
and
the
newscaster
said,
“well,
you
have
to
tell
me
the
broadcast”
and
he
said
well,
and
must
have
just
picked
the
21st
because
that
was
the
day
of
the
hearing,
give
me
the
one
at
noon.
so
the
newscaster
went
and
got
them,
the
one
at
noon.
now,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
of
what
was
read,
admittedly
it
was
this
one,
so
i’d
like
to
read
your
honor
what
was
read
to
him.
this
is
the
broadcast
at
noon
on
november
21,
united
states
district
court
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it’s
page
387a,
first
item,
was
a
90
second
broadcast.
this
broadcast
run
from
90
seconds
to
10
minutes
--
reads
as
follows,
“in
federal
court
today,
two
publishers
and
a
distributor
of
alleged
smut
literature
will
go
before
judge
gold,”
that
was
an
error,
it
wasn’t
judge
gold,
“claiming
they
are
suffering
economic
and
financial
hardship
because
of
a
recent
crackdown
on
such
material.”
now,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
upset
him.
but
his
response,
mr.
clark
spoke
about
what
he
said
concerning
the
united
states
attorney,
its
entirely
true,
he
said
to
the
newscaster,
rather
the
district
attorney.
that
the
district
attorney
had
said
something
and
here’s
what
he
said,
“the
district
attorney
says
that
my
publications
are”
and
i
quote
him.
“absolutely
legal,
absolutely
nothing
obscene
about
them,”
that’s
at
137a
of
the
record,
“absolutely
legal,
absolutely
nothing
obscene
about
them”.
well,
here
was
a
newscaster,
he
said
there
was
a
public
statement
by
the
district
attorney,
he
knew
one
there
was
no
public
statement.
he
knew
that
district
attorney
was
prosecuting
him
at
that
moment,
far
from
saying
they
were
absolutely
legal
as
nothing
obscene
about
them,
he
was
under
criminal
prosecution
and
number
three,
he
knew
there
was
a
lawsuit
by
this
very
man
to
enjoin
the
district
attorney
from
proceeding
with
the
criminal
prosecution.
by
that
time
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
this
man
is
subjected
to
half
hour
newscast.
he
had
the
conversation,
he’d
gone
back,
searched
out
this.
he
found
it,
he
read
it
to
him,
he
had
this
other
discussion
and
then
he
hung
up
the
phone.
now
i
suppose
he
might
have
said
“excuse
me”
before
he
hanged
up
the
phone,
my
friends
says
he
didn’t
say
excuse
me.
but
it’s
on
that
particular
finding,
that
particular
incident
that
judge
lord
said
that
there
was
a
request
for
retraction
or
even
worse
and
it’s
on
that
that
judge
lord
said
he
could
sustain
actual
malice,
that’s
the
only
thing
that
judge
lord
found
in
the
whole
record,
to
sustain
malice.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
if
you
read
mr.
rosenbloom’s
testimony
there,
if
that
is
malice
under
any
rule
of
law,
then
i
haven’t
read
the
case
that
would
sustain
it.
now,
there
never
was
a
request
for
retraction.
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
way,
this
is
what
it
said
about
that.
the
evidence
of
the
incident
lacks
both
sufficient
substance
and
clarity
to
meet
the
standard
required
to
show
actual
malice
and
it
amounted
to
a
little
more
than
an
argument
and
a
difference
of
opinion
between
plaintiff
and
one
of
defendant’s
employees,
who
i
had
was
a
part
time
newscaster.
now
your
honors,
there
are
the
facts.
your
honors,
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
it’s
entirely
clear
that
they
involved
matters
of
substantial
public
interest.
these
magazines
are
displayed
on
newsstands,
they
are
not
obscene.
but
this
particular
magazine,
the
only
one
in
the
record,
my
friend
said
the
jury
read
several
of
these
in
error,
there’s
only
one
in
the
record,
the
magazine,
this
one
was
devoted
to
youth,
youth
and
nudism.
it
has
a
big
article
to
teenagers.
it
was
displayed
in
drugstores,
it
was
displayed
on
news
counters
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
many
parents
would
object
to
having
their
children
go
into
a
drugstore
for
a
bar
of
chocolate,
see
this
magazine,
its
inside
cover
just
simply
has
a
nude
woman
with
all
parts
exposed,
its
other
inside
cover
has
the
same.
now,
i
know
that’s
not
obscenity,
but
i
know
an
awful
lot
of
the
public
consider
that
a
matter
of
public
controversy
as
to
whether
it
should
be
displayed
and
the
charge
was
against
the
display
and
sale.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes
i’m
going,
by
the
way,
it’s
not
in
the
record,
i’m
going
to
supply
it
to
the
clerk,
it’s
d2.
i
brought
it
down
with
me.
i
find
none
of
the
original
records
are
here
curiously.
its
d1,
it’s
marked
d2
for
identification,
d1
finally
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
absolutely
your
honor
or
i
wouldn’t
be
presenting
it.
the
petitioner
advances
that
in
this
situation,
in
this
situation,
a
test
of
reasonable
care
is
adequate
and
this
is
what
the
judge
below
said,
“plaintiff
is
protected
by
pennsylvania
libel
laws
without
first
amendment
strictures.”
and
that’s
what
the
petitioner
argued
in
the
court
below.
now
here
he
shifted
his
argument.
he
said
you
are
entitled
to
constitutional
protection,
but
only
for
reasonable
care.
in
the
court
below
there’s
not
a
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
of
that
and
the
court
adopted
his
view,
but
i
think
that’s
possibly
academic
because
under
either
event,
i
think
i
can
show
your
honor
is
that
newscasters
could
not
survive
at
least
under
the
present
method
of
giving
the
public
what
i
think
the
public
has
a
right
to
know.
this
court
decided
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
thus
far
public
official,
public
figure,
the
first
amendment
protection
is
needed
to
ensure
a
free
press,
to
ensure
an
uninhibited
robust
and
wide
open
discussion,
to
prevent
self
censorship.
to
prevent
the
chilling
effect
of
knowing
what
this
judge
said,
let
me
just
tell
your
honors
what
this
judge
said
was
the
obligation.
the
judge
said
the
news
medium
has
the
privilege,
this
is
charge
to
report
that
event,
but
the
word
event
i’ve
supplied.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
no
your
honor.
now
he
says
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
is
a
court
action,
it’s
not
as
liberal
as
the
common
law
rule,
less
liberal
than
the
common
law
rule.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
pennsylvania
rule
is
that
you’re
charge
with
proof.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
you’re
privileged
to
tell
the
truth.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
say
so.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
just
says
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
doubt
it
your
honor.
i
would
doubt
the
arrest
in
any
event.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
the
test
the
court
applied
here
was
the
correct
pennsylvania
rule,
the
rule
of
reasonable
care,
but
subject
to
state
standards.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
let
me
read
you
what
he
said,
i
think
this
may
give
you
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
applies
to
all.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
here
is
what
he
said,
the
news
medium
has
the
privilege
to
report
an
arrest,
but
the
news
medium
must
do
so
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care.
it
must
check
its
accuracy
and
it
must
determine
whether
or
not
it’s
true
or
false.
this
was
the
charge
that
went
to
the
jury.
apparently
it
was
checked
that
the
source
was
captain
ferguson
said
he,
should
there
--
should
the
defendant
have
gone
further
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that’s
the
question
he
left
for
the
jury.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
really
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
it
was
not
involved
here
and
i’m
not
a
libel
lawyer.
i
would
say
when
i
was
at
law
school
that
was
the
rule.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
would
have
to
recant
on
that.
i
would
say
that
first
of
all,
we
have
to
fear
a
comment
rule.
second,
i
would
say
that
you
are
held
to
a
high
degree
in
pennsylvania
and
i
think,
i’m
thinking
of
a
case
now
in
which
--
no
i
can’t
think
of
a
case,
i
can’t
think
of
a
case
in
which
a
newspaper
was
held
for,
after
reasonable
care.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
i
think
so
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
otherwise
you’re
liable.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
right.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
right.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
the
judge
made
that
crystal
clear.
he
said
that
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
he
was
talking
about
federal,
about
state.
he
said
the
plaintiff
is
protected
by
pennsylvania
libel
laws
without
first
amendment
strictures,
because
pennsylvania
libel
laws
recognize
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
we
have
a
more
innocuous
clause,
but
it
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
stricture
on
the
application
of
our
libel
laws.
i’m
sure
there’s
no
case
in
pennsylvania
that
so
holds.
now,
i
should
say
to
your
honors
that
the
record
will
show
the
way
these
broadcasts
have
gotten
up,
little
pieces
or
pasted
in
a
hurry,
it
doesn’t
show
in
the
fine
way
it’s
printed.
they’re
all
sort
of
things
crossed
out,
i
need
not
tell
your
honor
the
time
is
precious,
when
people
have
to
go
on
every
half
hour.
i’ve
asked
that
these
now
be
put
in
the
record
so
your
honors
can
see
them.
well
now,
i
have
very
little
time
left
and
therefore
i
should
like
merely
to
say
to
your
honors
as
to
access,
this
man
had
access.
anybody
arrested
in
a
headlined
item,
the
radio
stations
are
avid
to
have
them
appear,
but
mr.
ross,
the
manager
testified
that
they
find
they
can’t
get
people
who’ve
been
arrested
to
testify.
their
lawyers
tell
them
to
say
nothing,
that’s
why
even
want
to
come
on
the
radio
here,
that’s
why
he
never
complained,
that’s
why
his
lawyer
never
contacted
not
only
us
or
anybody
else.
i
want
to
say
in
conclusion
that
i
believe
that
when
he
got
into
this
highly
controversial
area
of
items
which
a
substantial
number
of
the
public
objects
to
he
assumed
the
risk
that
if
he
became
involved
in
a
public
controversy
that
the
newspaper
if
it
was
to
survive
with
our
modern
method
of
news
casting,
then
he
would
have
to
be
subject
to
the
rule
that
unless
there
was
calculated
falsehood
by
the
newspaper,
unless
it
acted
with
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
unless
it
acted
with
the
high
degree
of
knowledge
of
the
likelihood
of
the
falsity,
that
having
become
the
subject
of
a
public
controversy
in
an
area
which
he
entered
knowing
of
its
substantial
public
interest.
he,
different
from
the
other
200,000,000
members
of
the
public
became
subject
to
a
rule
which
is
necessary
if
the
freedom
of
the
press
in
this
kind
of
broadcast
to
survive
without
which,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
with
verdicts
today
going
to
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
for
a
man
whose
highest
income
in
his
lifetime
was
$5,700.00
would
have
to
stop
giving
their
present
kind
of
broadcast
and
find
some
other
way
to
meet
the
public’s
right
and
need
to
know
if
the
public
is
to
meet
its
--
the
obligations
of
a
modern
society
today.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
i
did
not
your
honor,
we
were
not
in
it
all.
our
firm
was
not
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes
i
can
very
clearly
your
honor.
the
judge
gave
complete
and
abysmal
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
this
man
came
to
the
station
and
the
phone
was
hung
down
on
him.
the
judge
said
that
that
was
worse
than
a
retraction.
his
opinion
shows
how
hotly
he
felt
about
him.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
and
judge
lord
was
wrong,
i
have
a
high
regard
for
judge
lord,
he
was
in
our
office
before
he
went
on
the
bench
but
he
was
just
in
error
in
this
situation,
and
that
exuded
to
the
jury.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
don’t
know
your
honor,
i
am
told
by
my
associate
we
do.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh
i
would
say,
i
would
say
that
under
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
have
doubt
whether
this
court
would
sustain
it
but
under
the
laws
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
i
would
doubt
whether
this
court
would
sustain
it.
but
under
the
laws
of
many
states,
i
believe
that
a
magazine
in
all
four
covers
of
which
have
nude
might
be
restricted
to
people
under
a
certain
age
and
its
display
might
be
restricted.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think
the
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
ginsberg
publications
were
far
worse
than
these.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
in
the
case
yes.
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
and
indeed
the
judge
in
this
case
dismissed
a
year
later,
dismissed
the
criminal
prosecution
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
violate
the
pennsylvania
obscenity
laws
and
also
that
it
would
be
proscribed
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
would
change
my
mind,
i
would
say
that
this
magazine
as
it
stands
today
directed
particularly
at
youth
with
articles
14
ages
so
labeled
would
be
proscribable
by
many
state
statutes
and
those
statutes
would
be
supported
by
this
court
insofar
as
they
apply
to
children
of
whatever
tender
years
are.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i’m
saying
mr.
justice
harlan
that
when
your
honors
extended
the
times
case
from
the
public
officials
to
the
public
figure,
that
what
all
of
the
scholars
have
said
in
what
all
of
the
lower
court
judges
have
said
is
the
fact
that
your
honors
were
necessarily
extending
it
to
where
issues
of
what
your
honor
called
substantial
and
important
public
interests
were
involved
that
in
those
issues
the
actual
malice
standard
would
be
applied.
now
your
honors
have
used
the
word
or
and
you
have
used
the
word
end
and
i
don’t
stand
on
that.
i
would
rather
stand
on
the
fact
that
anyone
who
reads
those
opinions
would
conclude
what
the
scholars
had
uniformly
concluded,
what
this
court
of
appeals
concluded,
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
macclenny
concluded,
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
united
medical
concluded
that
your
honors,
when
you
left
the
post
of
public
official
and
went
to
public
figure,
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
the
public’s
right
to
know
extended
to
public
issues
of
important
significant
matters.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
would
not
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
i
give
you
the
corollary
of
that
and
then
come
back
mr.
justice
stewart.
take
the
walker
situation.
suppose
instead
of
just
walker
suing,
you
had
a
university
authority
suing
on
the
same
story,
you
had
a
student
leader
suing
on
the
same
story
and
then
you
had
an
unanimous
student
who
because
of
his
articulateness
and
his
leadership
emerged
from
that
incident
as
the
man
who
really
there
after
was
able
to
lead
the
riot.
now
you
have
these
four
people,
admittedly
one
was
completely
unanimous.
if
i
were
to
answer
your
question
to
the
affirmative,
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
newspaper
in
publishing
that
same
story
had
to
say
well
we
can
publish
safely
as
to
walker.
maybe
as
to
the
university
officials
if
he
is
high
enough
to
be
a
public
figure,
probably
not
as
to
the
student
leader
but
certainly
not
as
to
the
unanimous
man,
how
can
the
newspaper
operate?
now
i
say
that
if
your
honors
could
show
that
in
order
to
involve
an
individual,
they
created
a
public
issue.
i
think
probably
that
might
demonstrate
actual
malice.
but
if
you
have
an
individual
who
becomes
involved
in
something
the
public
has
the
right
to
know
then
freedom
of
the
press
under
the
first
amendment
demands
that
it
be
held
for
fault
but
that
that
fault
be
calculated
falsehood
or
a
reckless
disregard.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
he
does
at
his
peril
because
i
would
accept,
i
would
accept
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
down
in
different
language,
it
happens
that
the
language
of
mr.
justice
harlan
used
in
which
he
said
that
it
had
to
be
a
matter
of
significant
and
important
interest
to
the
public,
i
think
that’s
right.
i
think
backyard
gossip
is
not.
i
think
if
you
want
to
engage
in
backyard
gossip,
it
maybe
even
about
a
public
figure,
you
may
be
liable.
this
court
hasn’t
yet
said
that
if
you
discuss
backyard
gossip
about
a
public
official,
i
know
a
case
is
coming
up
on
a
matter
that
was
spoken
30
years
before
or
more,
this
court
hasn’t
yet
said
that
the
instance
your
honor
presented,
the
actual
malice
will
apply
even
as
to
a
public
official,
let
alone
a
public
figure.
and
i
would
say
it
certainly
wouldn’t
apply
as
to
joe
doke.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
my
position
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
start
with
a
certainty
mr.
justice
harlan
that
if
this
court
holds
under
present
conditions
where
half
million
verdicts
and
million
dollar
and
three
quarter
million
have
become
par
for
the
course,
no
station
and
no
newspaper
can
operate
as
if
today
operates.
i
think
they’ve
got
to
sit
down
and
decide
what
they’re
going
to
do.
i’m
sure
that
if
i
were
counseling
wip,
i’d
say
you
have
to
give
up,
you’re
a
hot
news.
you
have
to
find
a
different
way
to
do
it
because
this
judge
has
said
that
every
time
there
is
an
arrest,
you
owe
an
obligation
of
investigation.
you’re
handling
an
arrest
two
minutes
before
broadcast,
what
do
you
do?
you
call
the
policeman,
he’s
not
there,
you
call
the
da
he’s
not
there,
do
you
let
it
go
the
next
day,
the
next
day
its
not
hot
news,
do
you
let
it
go
entirely?
i
suggest
to
your
honor,
that
with
20
items
on
a
broadcast
in
a
single
day,
i
looked
at
12
of
them
which
under
the
judges
standard,
we’d
owe
an
obligation
of
investigation
before
we
ran
the
newscast,
can
you
operate
that
way,
i
suggest
no.
so
i
say
to
your
honor,
that
it
looks
as
if
the
public
interest
in
a
time
and
i
suggest
that
there’s
never
been
a
time
when
news
has
been
important
dissent,
protest,
counter
protest,
people
are
avid
for
news,
they
act
more
quickly
on
news
and
never
before
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
think
news
is
more
important
today
than
ever.
that
at
such
a
time
and
with
jury
showing
what
they’ve
indicated,
and
i
suggest
to
you
these
verdicts
are
more
than
some
newspapers
cost,
they’re
more
than
most
radio
stations
cost,
that
at
such
a
time,
the
public
interest
is
served
by
protecting
the
individual
if
he
becomes
involved
in
a
matter
of
significant
and
important
public
interest
protecting
him
against
calculated
falsehood,
protecting
him
against
reckless
disregard
and
giving
the
newspapers
what
they
need
and
the
radio
stations
to
operate.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
under
modern
conditions
your
honor
i
sit
on
an
insurance
company
board.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it’s
not
in
my
view
under
what
the
developments
of
this
day
your
honor,
developments
to
this
day.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
it
please
the
court.
first
is
i
am
sure
the
court
would
know,
i
should
like
to
say
that
i
do
not
agree
at
all
with
my
friend
mr.
clark
with
the
question
here
is
whether
new
york
times
and
i
assume
he
would
include
though
he
did
not
say
butts
and
walker
in
the
rest
of
the
line
are
to
be
extended
i
quote
him
to
200
million
plain
people
engaging
in
ordinary
life.
that
is
not
the
question
on
which
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted.
it
is
not
the
question
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
it
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
further,
i
say
with
full
difference
that
i
do
not
agree
either
with
the
sketch
of
the
facts
presented
by
mr.
clark,
i
must
say
that
some
critical
facts
aren’t
exactly
stated
and
other
critical
facts
are
omitted.
therefore,
i
feel
called
upon
as
i
had
not
originally
intended
to
go
into
the
facts
with
the
court
particularly
since
in
the
cases
i
have
referred
to
this
court
has
adopted
the
salutary
policy
of
reviewing
de
novo
the
cases
to
find
whether
the
standard
for
constitutional
protection
pronounced
by
the
court
has
been
met
in
the
opinion
below
whether
jury
or
court.
in
the
first
place,
we
are
--
mr.
clark
creates
an
erroneous
impression
when
he
says
that
there
was
a
series
of
21
broadcasts,
a
series
of
21
broadcasts
on
wip
about
mr.
rosenbloom,
there
was
no
series
at
all.
we’re
not
dealing
here
with
a
feature
story,
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
documentary,
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
campaign
and
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
crusade,
we’re
not
dealing
with
the
series.
we’re
dealing
with
statements
which
occupied
one
sentence
to
four
sentences
at
the
maximum
in
newscasts
by
a
highly
oriented
station
which
every
half
hour
of
the
day,
24
hours
a
day,
48
times
a
day,
320
times
a
week,
every
week
of
the
year,
everyday
of
the
year,
broadcasts
every
half
hour
of
the
year,
and
every
statement
before
your
honor
fills
that
category.
it’s
a
one
sentence
statement
or
two
sentence
statement
or
a
four
sentence
statement
and
there
is
no
longer
one
there.
now,
the
second
thing
my
friend
mr.
clark
did
is
he
began
with
the
statement
of
facts
which
said
that
on
october
1st,
there
were
arrests,
20
of
them
he
said,
mr.
rosenbloom
was
one.
well,
they
were
news
dealers,
they
were
store
operators
and
they
were
distributor
who
supplied
these
store
operators
and
news
dealers,
mr.
rosenbloom.
and
then
he
says
the
next
to
that
was
on
october
4,
when
wip
had
a
broadcast
to
which
he
objects.
well,
your
honor,
a
great,
great
deal
happened
between
october
1
and
october
4,
to
which
mr.
clark
did
not
advert.
what
happened
here
is
that
is
a
result
of
complains
from
the
public,
and
after
a
two-month
investigation,
mr.
howard
leri,
not
captain
ferguson,
mr.
howard
leri
i
think
acknowledged
this
perhaps
at
that
time
america’s
leading
police
commissioner,
later
commissioner
in
new
york,
ordered
the
arrests
by
captain
ferguson
and
he
ordered
the
crackdown
on
what
he
then
regarded
as
obscene
material.
i
might
say
to
your
honors
that
mr.
clark
has
made
a
good
deal
of
captain
ferguson’s
definition
and
has
ridiculed
it
and
has
said
that
this
would
make
the
finest
paintings
in
the
museum
obscene.
but
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
just
a
few
years
ago,
few
years
before
that,
we’re
now
talking
about
talking
about
1963,
a
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
state
of
washington
gave
that
precise
definition
of
what
he
thought
a
majority
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
washington
considered
obscene
and
a
very
advertent
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
consisting
of
three
judges,
everyone
of
whom
served
as
a
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit,
affirmed
on
the
opinion
below
stating
that
the
judge
had
found
the
facts.
so
there
isn’t
any
shocking
finding
here,
it
was
erroneous,
erroneous
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
well,
on
october
1st,
when
the
arrest
came,
all
of
the
city
newspapers
had
headlines
about
it
and
necessarily
headlines
about
mr.
rosenbloom
who
was
the
supplier,
and
the
station
cbs
tv
had
headlines
about
it
and
that
happened
on
the
first
and
it
happened
on
the
second
and
it
happened
on
the
third
and
they
are
events
to
which
mr.
clark
did
not
have
heard.
and
those
newspaper
articles
and
that
cbs
tv
telecast
said
that
mr.
rosenbloom’s
products
were
smut
and
were
obscene.
and
what
did
mr.
rosenbloom
do
about
that?
i
mentioned
just
in
passing
he
brought
a
lawsuit
about
two
weeks
later
and
he
didn’t
name
wip
in
that
lawsuit.
i’m
going
to
show
he
didn’t
know
there
was
a
broadcast
in
wip
until
october
27th,
weeks
later,
didn’t
even
know
there
was
a
broadcast,
but
he
brought
a
suit
against
all
of
the
newspapers,
against
the
police
commissioner,
against
the
district
attorney,
one
for
a
million
dollars
in
damages
and
against
cbs
tv,
not
wip,
one
for
a
million
dollars
in
damages
and
the
second
to
enjoin
the
police
commissioner
and
the
district
attorney
from
prosecuting
him
for
criminal
violation
of
the
obscenity
law
and
against
the
newspapers
for
calling
his
products
smut
and
obscene
and
calling
him
a
smut
peddler
and
a
peddler
of
obscene
material.
did
not
name
wip
and
he
averred
there
that
so
great
was
his
damage
by
virtue
of
those
broadcasts
by
those
people
that
all,
nearly
all
of
his
costumers
as
the
language
his
used,
nearly
all
of
his
costumers
returned
all
of
his
material
to
him
which
he
had
supplied
to
them.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
suit
was
a
suit
for
defamation
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
for
injunction.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
damage
i
would
say
--
it’s
a
little
hard
to
tell
your
honor
but
i’d
say
it
had
to
be
defamation
because
i
don’t
know
what
else
it
could
be.
it’s
not
a
complaint
grounded
elegantly
for
libel
but
i
think
it
is.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
outcome
of
the
suit
your
honor
is
that
shortly
after
november
1,
when
we
broadcast
an
innocuous
statement
that
the
judge
would
decide
in
10
or
11
days,
he
did
decide,
he
dismissed
as
to
all
of
the
newspapers,
he
dismissed
as
to
cbs
tv
and
a
little
later
he
dismissed
as
to
the
two
city
officials.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that’s
the
end
of
those
suits.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
a
federal
court
suit.
i
might
say
to
you
your
honors
that
it
was
because
of
that,
that
judge
lord
ruled
in
this
case
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
recover
special
damages
against
wip
for
any
loss
of
business
at
any
kind.
he
said
he
has
no
right
to
special
damages.
now
i
suggest
the
allowance
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
might
say
to
you
your
honor
that
though
our
friends
on
the
other
side
have
the
strongest
condemnation
for
our
newscaster
because
he
confused
the
judges.
my
distinguished
friend
did
the
same
yesterday
when
he
said
they
were
the
same,
they’re
different.
the
judge
who
heard
this
case
is
judge
john
lord,
that
is
the
complaint.
the
judge
who
heard
this
case
is
judge
joseph
s.
lord.
judge
john
lord
has
since
become
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
and
it
has
been
good
deal
of
amusement
at
our
bar
of
constant
confusion.
well
now,
what
then
happened?
on
october
4th,
mr.
rosenbloom
was
rearrested
and
that
was
the
day
of
the
first
broadcast
of
which
my
friends
complained
about
wip.
now,
i’d
like
to
get
one
thing
straightened
out.
my
friend
says
that
there
was
a
headline
to
that
broadcast
which
read
“city
cracks
down
on
smut
merchants”.
i
submit
to
you
your
honors
he’s
in
error.
in
the
first
place,
the
station
doesn’t
have
headlines
and
i’ve
asked
my
friend,
one
of
the
counsel
who
had
all
of
the
original
records
because
the
clerk
had
sent
to
him
for
reasons
neither
he
nor
i
can
understand,
have
asked
him
to
give
one
of
our
boys
who
brought
down
to
me
yesterday
all
of
the
original
records
and
i’m
going
to
submit
them
to
the
clerk.
it
would
show
your
honors
that
most
of
them
don’t
have
anything
about
headlines
and
even
this
one
on
the
front
cover
apparently
for
the
advice
of
the
announcer
is
called
repeating
the
headline
news.
it
was
testified
to
by
nobody
as
having
been
broadcast.
the
manager
said
five
years
later,
he
wouldn’t
say
it
was
or
wasn’t,
but
he
pointed
out
that
on
the
same
day
of
the
broadcast
to
which
i’m
going
to
refer,
the
one
complained
of,
there
was
another
item
in
the
news
about
two
people
unconnected
with
this
crackdown
who
were
arrested
and
held
in
$35,000.00
bail
for
transporting
hardcore
pornography.
he
didn’t
even
know
whether
in
advising
the
newscaster
that
this
was
what
was
in
there
among
the
leading
news,
whether
it
referred
to
the
rosenbloom
group
or
whether
it
referred
to
the
other
group
and
there’s
not
a
word
of
testimony
in
the
record
by
anybody
on
the
subject.
now,
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
offensive
broadcast?
well,
your
honors,
it
consist
of
four
lines,
it’s
pretty
nearly
the
longest
of
them
and
it
says,
here
at
350a
of
the
record,
that
a
jury
of
six
men
and
six
women,
it’s
the
third
paragraph
if
your
honors
are
looking
at
it,
350a,
it
says
a
jury
of
--
it
says
that
the
special
investigation
squad,
it’s
the
second
item,
that
special
investigation
squad
raided
the
home
of
mr.
rosenbloom,
that’s
a
factual
statement.
the
second
is
police
confiscated
1,000
allegedly
obscene
books
at
rosenbloom’s
home
and
arrested
him
on
charges
of
possession
of
obscene
literature.
and
my
friend
say
they
don’t
object
to
that
--
those
two
sentences.
then
comes
the
third,
the
one
they
object
to,
the
special
investigation
squad
also
raided
a
barn
in
the
20
hundred
block
of
welsh
avenue
near
bustleton
and
confiscated
3,000
obscene
books.
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
if
that
is
read
in
context,
then
the
alleged
of
the
pre
proceeding
sentence
applies
there
and
if
it’s
read
out
of
context,
my
friend
mr.
clark
is
again
in
error
in
having
said
expressly
that
this
said
that
mr.
rosenbloom
rented
this
barn,
it
doesn’t.
if
it’s
read
out
of
context,
it
doesn’t
even
apply
to
rosenbloom.
it’s
just
an
independent
barn
at
an
independent
address.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
this
is
page
350a
your
honor,
paragraph
two.
so
read
in
context,
the
word
allegedly
simply
carries
over.
read
out
of
context,
it
doesn’t
apply
to
rosenbloom
at
all,
it
turns
out
later
it
was
rosenbloom’s
barn.
the
final
sentence,
they
don’t
object
to
and
that
is
that
captain
ferguson
says
he
believes
they
have
hit
the
supply
of
a
main
distributor
for
obscene
material
in
philadelphia
and
that’s
the
whole
broadcast
your
honors.
now,
and
then
what
happened?
within
an
hour,
it
was
corrected.
there
were
six
more
broadcasts,
there
was
one
and
a
half
hour
and
then
there
were
six
broadcasts
up
to
8
am
in
the
morning,
every
one
of
them
put
the
word
allegedly
in.
so
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
it’s
quite
turn
at
the
very
worst,
it
was
a
slip
of
the
pen
to
have
let
it
out
and
at
the
very
worst,
it
was
corrected
within
the
hour.
mr.
clark
said
some
of
the
later
broadcast
included
it,
every
one
of
them
starting
with
7
pm,
this
was
a
6
pm
broadcast,
had
the
word
allegedly
in
it.
now,
after
this
series
of
broadcast,
i
emphasize
this
to
your
honors,
there
was
never
again
a
broadcast
that
mentioned
mr.
rosenbloom,
never
again
a
broadcast
that
mentioned
mr.
rosenbloom.
indeed,
there
was
never
again
a
broadcast
on
the
subject
for
17
more
days,
not
till
october
21.
what
happened
was
that
on
october
15,
this
complaint
was
filed,
that
i’ve
told
your
honors
about
in
which
wip
was
not
named,
but
the
suit
drew
no
attention.
for
some
reason
our
friends
chose
not
to
publicize
it.
it
first
public
notice
the
suit
drew
was
on
october
21,
why?
because
on
that
day
the
court
set
it
down
for
hearing,
and
when
the
court
announced
it
was
set
down
for
hearing,
everyone
learned
for
the
first
time,
no
one
knew
about
the
suit's
existence
except
the
plaintiffs
and
presumably
if
the
defendants
were
served,
no
papers
had
been
filed
yet.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
federal
court
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
complaint
was
a
public
document
if
you
went
down
and
looked
at
it.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
you
had
the
right
to
see
it
if
you
knew
it
was
there.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
now,
mr.
clark
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
were
no
broadcasts
that
named
mr.
rosenbloom
after
the
ones
i’ve
told
you
about
starting
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
after
the
one
starting
october
4
and
continuing
through
to
the
next
morning,
announcing
the
arrest.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
right,
8
am,
it
ended.
mr.
clark
said
yesterday
that
this
was
not
hot
news
since
the
complaint
had
been
filed
several
days
before.
well,
i
suggest
to
you
it
was
not
news
at
all
until
october
21
when
people
got
to
know
about
it
and
then
it
surely
was
hot
news
because
it
was
the
first
notice
anyone
had.
now
that,
the
hearing
was
postponed
to
october
25
and
the
next
reference
to
the
case,
now,
there
were
these
broadcasts
on
the
21
saying
the
hearing.
on
october
25
was
the
next
set
of
broadcasts
and
the
last
of
which
complaint
is
made,
there
were
these
three,
the
october
4
arrest,
october
21
case
sat
down
for
argument,
the
court
announced
the
postponement
to
october
25.
and
so
on
that
day
there
are
two
newscasts
reporting
the
developments
on
that
date.
there’s
only
one
other
broadcast
on
november
1
to
which
i
referred
in
reply
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
that
simply
nobody
objects
to
it.
it
said
that
this
alleged
charge
was
to
be
decided
by
the
court
within
10
or
11
days
and
there
it
is.
none
of
these
broadcasts
on
october
21
or
25
named
the
defendants.
if
anyone
had
a
recollection
back
to
october
4
of
this
arrest,
there’s
no
way
he
could
know
whether
it
was
mr.
rosenbloom
or
whether
these
two
other
fellows
who
were
there,
was
announced
were
held
in
$35,000.00
bail
for
the
sale
of
pornographic
literature.
nothing
in
the
record
shows
that
a
single
individual
listened
or
heard
the
wip
broadcast.
we
know
that
after
the
most
offending
of
them,
a
suit
was
filed,
wip
was
not
even
mentioned.
we
know
that
the
plaintiff
said
that
he
never
heard
any
of
the
broadcasts
and
not
a
witness
was
produced
who
heard
any
of
the
broadcasts
to
this
day,
except
one
that
i
want
to
refer
to.
in
just
a
moment.
indeed,
i
think
it
would
be
well
if
i
refer
to
him
right
now,
out
of
the
order
of
my
argument.
mr.
rosenbloom
nor
his
attorney
and
he
obviously
had
an
attorney
very
early
in
this
matter,
ever
contacted
the
station.
they
never
asked
for
a
retraction,
they
never
asked
for
the
right
to
say
anything.
i
think
i
know
why
and
i
think
i’ll
tell
your
honor
why.
there
was
one
contact.
now,
mr.
clark
was
mistaken
as
to
what
brought
about
the
contact.
the
record
is
extremely
clear
on
that
and
has
two
witnesses
on
it.
mr.
clark
said
that
there
were
complaints
from
many
friends
as
to
the
wip
broadcast.
and
so
on
october
27,
he
said,
mr.
rosenbloom
went
to
wip,
was
not
permitted
to
see
anyone,
but
had
one
tape
played
back,
that
isn’t
the
story
in
the
record
at
all.
the
story
in
the
record
is
that
he
went
to
a
restaurant
where
he
met
a
friend
named
chews
(ph)
who
testified.
both
he
and
chews
testified
as
to
this
and
chews
said
to
him,
say
“i
heard
a
broad”,
he
knew
he
was
in
the
magazine
business,
say
“i
heard
a
broadcast”,
they
didn’t
mention
any
names,
“i
heard
a
broadcast
about
somebody
arrested
and
they
said
that
they
ought
to
put
that
guy
in
jail
and
throw
the
key
away”.
first,
let
me
say
there’s
no
such
broadcast
by
wip.
the
every
transcript
of
every
broadcast
was
brought
into
the
room
and
adlibbing
was
testified,
was
not
permitted,
but
he
said
that
he’d
heard
this.
rosenbloom
said
“oh
that’s
me”.
now
i
suggest
to
your
honors
it
probably
wasn’t
our
broadcast
because
if
you
look
at
the
broadcast
on
october
21
and
25,
they
don’t
mention
arrest.
but
nevertheless
this
upset
him
and
he
made
a
beeline
to
the
station,
that’s
what
sent
him
to
the
station.
and
when
he
came
to
the
station,
he
said
he
wanted
to
talk
to
somebody
about
newscasts
and
they
have
a
regular
line
right
in
the
lobby,
right
to
the
newscasters
for
anybody
who
inquires
about
newscasters,
he
wasn’t
denied
anything.
he
was
given
the
line
and
he
called
the
newscaster,
a
man
named
nick
wright,
and
he
said
to
the
newscaster
“i’ve
been
told
there
was
something
about
me
on
wip”.
according
to
the
record,
he
didn’t
tell
him
what
actually
happened
and
the
newscaster
said,
“well,
you
have
to
tell
me
the
broadcast”
and
he
said
well,
and
must
have
just
picked
the
21st
because
that
was
the
day
of
the
hearing,
give
me
the
one
at
noon.
so
the
newscaster
went
and
got
them,
the
one
at
noon.
now,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
of
what
was
read,
admittedly
it
was
this
one,
so
i’d
like
to
read
your
honor
what
was
read
to
him.
this
is
the
broadcast
at
noon
on
november
21,
united
states
district
court
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it’s
page
387a,
first
item,
was
a
90
second
broadcast.
this
broadcast
run
from
90
seconds
to
10
minutes
--
reads
as
follows,
“in
federal
court
today,
two
publishers
and
a
distributor
of
alleged
smut
literature
will
go
before
judge
gold,”
that
was
an
error,
it
wasn’t
judge
gold,
“claiming
they
are
suffering
economic
and
financial
hardship
because
of
a
recent
crackdown
on
such
material.”
now,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
upset
him.
but
his
response,
mr.
clark
spoke
about
what
he
said
concerning
the
united
states
attorney,
its
entirely
true,
he
said
to
the
newscaster,
rather
the
district
attorney.
that
the
district
attorney
had
said
something
and
here’s
what
he
said,
“the
district
attorney
says
that
my
publications
are”
and
i
quote
him.
“absolutely
legal,
absolutely
nothing
obscene
about
them,”
that’s
at
137a
of
the
record,
“absolutely
legal,
absolutely
nothing
obscene
about
them”.
well,
here
was
a
newscaster,
he
said
there
was
a
public
statement
by
the
district
attorney,
he
knew
one
there
was
no
public
statement.
he
knew
that
district
attorney
was
prosecuting
him
at
that
moment,
far
from
saying
they
were
absolutely
legal
as
nothing
obscene
about
them,
he
was
under
criminal
prosecution
and
number
three,
he
knew
there
was
a
lawsuit
by
this
very
man
to
enjoin
the
district
attorney
from
proceeding
with
the
criminal
prosecution.
by
that
time
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
this
man
is
subjected
to
half
hour
newscast.
he
had
the
conversation,
he’d
gone
back,
searched
out
this.
he
found
it,
he
read
it
to
him,
he
had
this
other
discussion
and
then
he
hung
up
the
phone.
now
i
suppose
he
might
have
said
“excuse
me”
before
he
hanged
up
the
phone,
my
friends
says
he
didn’t
say
excuse
me.
but
it’s
on
that
particular
finding,
that
particular
incident
that
judge
lord
said
that
there
was
a
request
for
retraction
or
even
worse
and
it’s
on
that
that
judge
lord
said
he
could
sustain
actual
malice,
that’s
the
only
thing
that
judge
lord
found
in
the
whole
record,
to
sustain
malice.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
if
you
read
mr.
rosenbloom’s
testimony
there,
if
that
is
malice
under
any
rule
of
law,
then
i
haven’t
read
the
case
that
would
sustain
it.
now,
there
never
was
a
request
for
retraction.
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
way,
this
is
what
it
said
about
that.
the
evidence
of
the
incident
lacks
both
sufficient
substance
and
clarity
to
meet
the
standard
required
to
show
actual
malice
and
it
amounted
to
a
little
more
than
an
argument
and
a
difference
of
opinion
between
plaintiff
and
one
of
defendant’s
employees,
who
i
had
was
a
part
time
newscaster.
now
your
honors,
there
are
the
facts.
your
honors,
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
that
it’s
entirely
clear
that
they
involved
matters
of
substantial
public
interest.
these
magazines
are
displayed
on
newsstands,
they
are
not
obscene.
but
this
particular
magazine,
the
only
one
in
the
record,
my
friend
said
the
jury
read
several
of
these
in
error,
there’s
only
one
in
the
record,
the
magazine,
this
one
was
devoted
to
youth,
youth
and
nudism.
it
has
a
big
article
to
teenagers.
it
was
displayed
in
drugstores,
it
was
displayed
on
news
counters
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
many
parents
would
object
to
having
their
children
go
into
a
drugstore
for
a
bar
of
chocolate,
see
this
magazine,
its
inside
cover
just
simply
has
a
nude
woman
with
all
parts
exposed,
its
other
inside
cover
has
the
same.
now,
i
know
that’s
not
obscenity,
but
i
know
an
awful
lot
of
the
public
consider
that
a
matter
of
public
controversy
as
to
whether
it
should
be
displayed
and
the
charge
was
against
the
display
and
sale.
now
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes
i’m
going,
by
the
way,
it’s
not
in
the
record,
i’m
going
to
supply
it
to
the
clerk,
it’s
d2.
i
brought
it
down
with
me.
i
find
none
of
the
original
records
are
here
curiously.
its
d1,
it’s
marked
d2
for
identification,
d1
finally
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
absolutely
your
honor
or
i
wouldn’t
be
presenting
it.
the
petitioner
advances
that
in
this
situation,
in
this
situation,
a
test
of
reasonable
care
is
adequate
and
this
is
what
the
judge
below
said,
“plaintiff
is
protected
by
pennsylvania
libel
laws
without
first
amendment
strictures.”
and
that’s
what
the
petitioner
argued
in
the
court
below.
now
here
he
shifted
his
argument.
he
said
you
are
entitled
to
constitutional
protection,
but
only
for
reasonable
care.
in
the
court
below
there’s
not
a
mentioned
by
the
petitioner
of
that
and
the
court
adopted
his
view,
but
i
think
that’s
possibly
academic
because
under
either
event,
i
think
i
can
show
your
honor
is
that
newscasters
could
not
survive
at
least
under
the
present
method
of
giving
the
public
what
i
think
the
public
has
a
right
to
know.
this
court
decided
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
thus
far
public
official,
public
figure,
the
first
amendment
protection
is
needed
to
ensure
a
free
press,
to
ensure
an
uninhibited
robust
and
wide
open
discussion,
to
prevent
self
censorship.
to
prevent
the
chilling
effect
of
knowing
what
this
judge
said,
let
me
just
tell
your
honors
what
this
judge
said
was
the
obligation.
the
judge
said
the
news
medium
has
the
privilege,
this
is
charge
to
report
that
event,
but
the
word
event
i’ve
supplied.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
no
your
honor.
now
he
says
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there
is
a
court
action,
it’s
not
as
liberal
as
the
common
law
rule,
less
liberal
than
the
common
law
rule.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
pennsylvania
rule
is
that
you’re
charge
with
proof.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
you’re
privileged
to
tell
the
truth.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
say
so.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
just
says
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
doubt
it
your
honor.
i
would
doubt
the
arrest
in
any
event.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
the
test
the
court
applied
here
was
the
correct
pennsylvania
rule,
the
rule
of
reasonable
care,
but
subject
to
state
standards.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
let
me
read
you
what
he
said,
i
think
this
may
give
you
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
it
applies
to
all.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
here
is
what
he
said,
the
news
medium
has
the
privilege
to
report
an
arrest,
but
the
news
medium
must
do
so
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care.
it
must
check
its
accuracy
and
it
must
determine
whether
or
not
it’s
true
or
false.
this
was
the
charge
that
went
to
the
jury.
apparently
it
was
checked
that
the
source
was
captain
ferguson
said
he,
should
there
--
should
the
defendant
have
gone
further
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that’s
the
question
he
left
for
the
jury.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
really
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
it
was
not
involved
here
and
i’m
not
a
libel
lawyer.
i
would
say
when
i
was
at
law
school
that
was
the
rule.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
would
have
to
recant
on
that.
i
would
say
that
first
of
all,
we
have
to
fear
a
comment
rule.
second,
i
would
say
that
you
are
held
to
a
high
degree
in
pennsylvania
and
i
think,
i’m
thinking
of
a
case
now
in
which
--
no
i
can’t
think
of
a
case,
i
can’t
think
of
a
case
in
which
a
newspaper
was
held
for,
after
reasonable
care.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
i
think
so
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
otherwise
you’re
liable.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
right.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
right.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
the
judge
made
that
crystal
clear.
he
said
that
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
he
was
talking
about
federal,
about
state.
he
said
the
plaintiff
is
protected
by
pennsylvania
libel
laws
without
first
amendment
strictures,
because
pennsylvania
libel
laws
recognize
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
we
have
a
more
innocuous
clause,
but
it
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
stricture
on
the
application
of
our
libel
laws.
i’m
sure
there’s
no
case
in
pennsylvania
that
so
holds.
now,
i
should
say
to
your
honors
that
the
record
will
show
the
way
these
broadcasts
have
gotten
up,
little
pieces
or
pasted
in
a
hurry,
it
doesn’t
show
in
the
fine
way
it’s
printed.
they’re
all
sort
of
things
crossed
out,
i
need
not
tell
your
honor
the
time
is
precious,
when
people
have
to
go
on
every
half
hour.
i’ve
asked
that
these
now
be
put
in
the
record
so
your
honors
can
see
them.
well
now,
i
have
very
little
time
left
and
therefore
i
should
like
merely
to
say
to
your
honors
as
to
access,
this
man
had
access.
anybody
arrested
in
a
headlined
item,
the
radio
stations
are
avid
to
have
them
appear,
but
mr.
ross,
the
manager
testified
that
they
find
they
can’t
get
people
who’ve
been
arrested
to
testify.
their
lawyers
tell
them
to
say
nothing,
that’s
why
even
want
to
come
on
the
radio
here,
that’s
why
he
never
complained,
that’s
why
his
lawyer
never
contacted
not
only
us
or
anybody
else.
i
want
to
say
in
conclusion
that
i
believe
that
when
he
got
into
this
highly
controversial
area
of
items
which
a
substantial
number
of
the
public
objects
to
he
assumed
the
risk
that
if
he
became
involved
in
a
public
controversy
that
the
newspaper
if
it
was
to
survive
with
our
modern
method
of
news
casting,
then
he
would
have
to
be
subject
to
the
rule
that
unless
there
was
calculated
falsehood
by
the
newspaper,
unless
it
acted
with
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
unless
it
acted
with
the
high
degree
of
knowledge
of
the
likelihood
of
the
falsity,
that
having
become
the
subject
of
a
public
controversy
in
an
area
which
he
entered
knowing
of
its
substantial
public
interest.
he,
different
from
the
other
200,000,000
members
of
the
public
became
subject
to
a
rule
which
is
necessary
if
the
freedom
of
the
press
in
this
kind
of
broadcast
to
survive
without
which,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
with
verdicts
today
going
to
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
for
a
man
whose
highest
income
in
his
lifetime
was
$5,700.00
would
have
to
stop
giving
their
present
kind
of
broadcast
and
find
some
other
way
to
meet
the
public’s
right
and
need
to
know
if
the
public
is
to
meet
its
--
the
obligations
of
a
modern
society
today.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
i
did
not
your
honor,
we
were
not
in
it
all.
our
firm
was
not
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes
i
can
very
clearly
your
honor.
the
judge
gave
complete
and
abysmal
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
this
man
came
to
the
station
and
the
phone
was
hung
down
on
him.
the
judge
said
that
that
was
worse
than
a
retraction.
his
opinion
shows
how
hotly
he
felt
about
him.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
and
judge
lord
was
wrong,
i
have
a
high
regard
for
judge
lord,
he
was
in
our
office
before
he
went
on
the
bench
but
he
was
just
in
error
in
this
situation,
and
that
exuded
to
the
jury.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
don’t
know
your
honor,
i
am
told
by
my
associate
we
do.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh
i
would
say,
i
would
say
that
under
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
have
doubt
whether
this
court
would
sustain
it
but
under
the
laws
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
i
would
doubt
whether
this
court
would
sustain
it.
but
under
the
laws
of
many
states,
i
believe
that
a
magazine
in
all
four
covers
of
which
have
nude
might
be
restricted
to
people
under
a
certain
age
and
its
display
might
be
restricted.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
think
the
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
ginsberg
publications
were
far
worse
than
these.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
in
the
case
yes.
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no
and
indeed
the
judge
in
this
case
dismissed
a
year
later,
dismissed
the
criminal
prosecution
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
violate
the
pennsylvania
obscenity
laws
and
also
that
it
would
be
proscribed
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
would
change
my
mind,
i
would
say
that
this
magazine
as
it
stands
today
directed
particularly
at
youth
with
articles
14
ages
so
labeled
would
be
proscribable
by
many
state
statutes
and
those
statutes
would
be
supported
by
this
court
insofar
as
they
apply
to
children
of
whatever
tender
years
are.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i’m
saying
mr.
justice
harlan
that
when
your
honors
extended
the
times
case
from
the
public
officials
to
the
public
figure,
that
what
all
of
the
scholars
have
said
in
what
all
of
the
lower
court
judges
have
said
is
the
fact
that
your
honors
were
necessarily
extending
it
to
where
issues
of
what
your
honor
called
substantial
and
important
public
interests
were
involved
that
in
those
issues
the
actual
malice
standard
would
be
applied.
now
your
honors
have
used
the
word
or
and
you
have
used
the
word
end
and
i
don’t
stand
on
that.
i
would
rather
stand
on
the
fact
that
anyone
who
reads
those
opinions
would
conclude
what
the
scholars
had
uniformly
concluded,
what
this
court
of
appeals
concluded,
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
macclenny
concluded,
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
united
medical
concluded
that
your
honors,
when
you
left
the
post
of
public
official
and
went
to
public
figure,
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
the
public’s
right
to
know
extended
to
public
issues
of
important
significant
matters.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
would
not
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
i
give
you
the
corollary
of
that
and
then
come
back
mr.
justice
stewart.
take
the
walker
situation.
suppose
instead
of
just
walker
suing,
you
had
a
university
authority
suing
on
the
same
story,
you
had
a
student
leader
suing
on
the
same
story
and
then
you
had
an
unanimous
student
who
because
of
his
articulateness
and
his
leadership
emerged
from
that
incident
as
the
man
who
really
there
after
was
able
to
lead
the
riot.
now
you
have
these
four
people,
admittedly
one
was
completely
unanimous.
if
i
were
to
answer
your
question
to
the
affirmative,
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
newspaper
in
publishing
that
same
story
had
to
say
well
we
can
publish
safely
as
to
walker.
maybe
as
to
the
university
officials
if
he
is
high
enough
to
be
a
public
figure,
probably
not
as
to
the
student
leader
but
certainly
not
as
to
the
unanimous
man,
how
can
the
newspaper
operate?
now
i
say
that
if
your
honors
could
show
that
in
order
to
involve
an
individual,
they
created
a
public
issue.
i
think
probably
that
might
demonstrate
actual
malice.
but
if
you
have
an
individual
who
becomes
involved
in
something
the
public
has
the
right
to
know
then
freedom
of
the
press
under
the
first
amendment
demands
that
it
be
held
for
fault
but
that
that
fault
be
calculated
falsehood
or
a
reckless
disregard.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
he
does
at
his
peril
because
i
would
accept,
i
would
accept
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
down
in
different
language,
it
happens
that
the
language
of
mr.
justice
harlan
used
in
which
he
said
that
it
had
to
be
a
matter
of
significant
and
important
interest
to
the
public,
i
think
that’s
right.
i
think
backyard
gossip
is
not.
i
think
if
you
want
to
engage
in
backyard
gossip,
it
maybe
even
about
a
public
figure,
you
may
be
liable.
this
court
hasn’t
yet
said
that
if
you
discuss
backyard
gossip
about
a
public
official,
i
know
a
case
is
coming
up
on
a
matter
that
was
spoken
30
years
before
or
more,
this
court
hasn’t
yet
said
that
the
instance
your
honor
presented,
the
actual
malice
will
apply
even
as
to
a
public
official,
let
alone
a
public
figure.
and
i
would
say
it
certainly
wouldn’t
apply
as
to
joe
doke.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
my
position
--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
start
with
a
certainty
mr.
justice
harlan
that
if
this
court
holds
under
present
conditions
where
half
million
verdicts
and
million
dollar
and
three
quarter
million
have
become
par
for
the
course,
no
station
and
no
newspaper
can
operate
as
if
today
operates.
i
think
they’ve
got
to
sit
down
and
decide
what
they’re
going
to
do.
i’m
sure
that
if
i
were
counseling
wip,
i’d
say
you
have
to
give
up,
you’re
a
hot
news.
you
have
to
find
a
different
way
to
do
it
because
this
judge
has
said
that
every
time
there
is
an
arrest,
you
owe
an
obligation
of
investigation.
you’re
handling
an
arrest
two
minutes
before
broadcast,
what
do
you
do?
you
call
the
policeman,
he’s
not
there,
you
call
the
da
he’s
not
there,
do
you
let
it
go
the
next
day,
the
next
day
its
not
hot
news,
do
you
let
it
go
entirely?
i
suggest
to
your
honor,
that
with
20
items
on
a
broadcast
in
a
single
day,
i
looked
at
12
of
them
which
under
the
judges
standard,
we’d
owe
an
obligation
of
investigation
before
we
ran
the
newscast,
can
you
operate
that
way,
i
suggest
no.
so
i
say
to
your
honor,
that
it
looks
as
if
the
public
interest
in
a
time
and
i
suggest
that
there’s
never
been
a
time
when
news
has
been
important
dissent,
protest,
counter
protest,
people
are
avid
for
news,
they
act
more
quickly
on
news
and
never
before
in
the
history
of
our
country.
i
think
news
is
more
important
today
than
ever.
that
at
such
a
time
and
with
jury
showing
what
they’ve
indicated,
and
i
suggest
to
you
these
verdicts
are
more
than
some
newspapers
cost,
they’re
more
than
most
radio
stations
cost,
that
at
such
a
time,
the
public
interest
is
served
by
protecting
the
individual
if
he
becomes
involved
in
a
matter
of
significant
and
important
public
interest
protecting
him
against
calculated
falsehood,
protecting
him
against
reckless
disregard
and
giving
the
newspapers
what
they
need
and
the
radio
stations
to
operate.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
under
modern
conditions
your
honor
i
sit
on
an
insurance
company
board.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it’s
not
in
my
view
under
what
the
developments
of
this
day
your
honor,
developments
to
this
day.
thank
you.
