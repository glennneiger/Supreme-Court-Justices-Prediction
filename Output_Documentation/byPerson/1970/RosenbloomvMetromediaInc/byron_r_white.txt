justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
special
pennsylvanian
rule
applicable
to
the
reporting
of
police
in
the
court
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
pennsylvanian
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
when
you
report,
there
is
no
--
if
you
report
the
truth
as
to
what
the
complaint
says,
you
have
privilege
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
it’s
the
reputation
and
one
that
might
not
be
a
libel?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
reporting
the
arrest
and
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
lead
you
back
to
the
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
court
had
test
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
that
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
rule
applied
to
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
applied
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
(inaudible)
through
reasonable
care
and
the
judge
said
applies
to
reporting
police
action,
applies
to
reporting
of
other
events?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
generally,
if
they
were,
the
use
of
reasonable
care
in
reporting
news
of
any
kind
is
an
upset?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
goes
beyond
news
worthiness,
any
news
worthy
item
and
this
maybe
the
reasonable
care
and
can
read
and
can
tell
a
lie,
a
libel
just
lies?
justice
byron
r.
white
reasonable
care
will
only
apply
when
reporting
of
public
activity?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
tell
a
lie,
if
you
tell
a
lie,
it
is
libelous,
your
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you’re
obligated?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’d
pay
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
none
of
that,
as
this
probably
shows
has
any
constitutional
underpinning
either
state
or
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
could
give
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
don’t
know
how
many
problems
occurred
to
the
first
amendment
to
your
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
segal,
does
pennsylvania
have
a
law
specially
to
the
publications
available
to
children
or
teenager
like
some
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
it
happens
that
some
reference
in
our
cases
anyway
to
perhaps
states
would
agree
with
me
and
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
give
example
of
this
particular
magazine
you
have
that
could
be
banned
in
new
york
and
texas
under
their
special
statutes
related
to
publications
like
display
and
sold
if
you’re
under
16?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wonder,
if
you
haven’t,
i
just
wonder
if
there
has
never
been
surfaced
in
this
litigation
whether
that
particular
magazine
might
actually
be
held
to
be
obscene
with
respect
to
younger
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
the
pennsylvania
law
has
been
what
it
is
for
a
long
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
simply
say
that
the
reasonable
care
standard
is
not
sufficient
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
is
not
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not,
not
sufficient.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
they
even
have
to
--
why
should
there
be
any
constitutional
rule
at
all,
federal
constitutional
law
at
all
as
between
private
persons
where
the
one
person,
one
kind
of
person
liable
to
another
private
person,
why
shouldn’t
just
the
existing
law
of
libel
be
permitted
to
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
special
pennsylvanian
rule
applicable
to
the
reporting
of
police
in
the
court
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
pennsylvanian
rule?

now,

would
it
lead
you
back

justice

if
the

justice
byron

and
what
does
that
say?
justice
byron

what
is
that
rule
applied
to
pennsylvania?
justice
byron

that
applied
(inaudible)
