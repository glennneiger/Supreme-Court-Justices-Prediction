we’ll
hear
arguments
in
number
66,
rosenbloom
against
metromedia.
mr.
clark
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
clark
you’re
putting
an
emphasis
on
that.
i’m
not
quite
sure
i
follow
it.
you’re
suggesting
that
the
situation
might
be
different
if
there
were
doubt
about
the
legality
of
the
publications
that
he
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
quality
zone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark,
if
the
word
obscene
without
the
adjective
alleged,
or
allegedly
obscene
had
not
been
in
the
case
if
they
just
said
he
was
a
peddler
of
girly
magazines,
etcetera,
what
would
be
your
view
of
his
claim
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
was,
would
you
regard
that
this
libel
as
if
they
said
that
he
was
a
peddler
of
girly
magazines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
term
obscene
becomes
quite
important
in
your
position
that
doesn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
just
in
--
i
take
it
you’re
arguing
that
that
would
imply
an
illegality
which
would
conceivably
might
not
be
present
in
the
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
arguments,
mr.
clark
are
you
reserving
the
rest
of
your
time
for
rebuttal
or
you
wish
to
continue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
segal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
the
end
of
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
not
in
the
record,
you
mean
not
in
the
record
here,
it’s
in
the
record
of
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
segal,
thank
you.
mr.
clark.
clark
we’ve
made
an
adjustment
in
your
time
in
relation
to
some
extra
time
for
mr.
segal’s
argument
in
chief,
not
for
all
the
interrogation,
you
may
get
enlarged
on
that
same
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
think
the
alleged
libel
is
to
be
evaluated
on
what
someone
thought
was
said
or
what
was
actually
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
theory
did
the
trial
judge
admit
an
evidence,
the
statement
of
this
friend
whom
he
met
at
the
restaurant
as
to
what
he
thought
he
had
heard?
how
is
that
in
relevance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark,
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
harlan,
i
thought
you
said
the,
something
to
the
fact
that
the
first
amendment
was
only
intended
to
protect
the
truth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark,--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
interested
on
that
testimony
on
page
26a,
could
you
put
your
eyes
at
that
for
a
moment.
that’s
the
testimony
relating
apparently
to
the
first
broadcast.
taking
the
first
sentence
which
is
five
lines,
that’s
the
sentence
in
which
they
refer
to
confiscating
1,000
allegedly
obscene
books.
if
that
is
all
they
have
said,
at
the
end
of
that
sentence
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
let’s
take
the
first
one.
well,
the
first
two
sentences
excuse
me,
but
particularly
one,
police
confiscated
a
thousand
allegedly
obscene
books
from
rosenbloom’s
home
and
so
forth.
would
that
be
libelous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
it
a
recital
of
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
say
that
the
first
two
sentences
are
probably
protected
utterance,
the
next
sentences
in
which
they
are
describing
this
whole
episode
with
involving
issue
say
20
men,
the
next
two
sentences
don’t
describe
mr.
rosenbloom
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
way
you
could
have
challenged
that
would
be
cross
appeal
