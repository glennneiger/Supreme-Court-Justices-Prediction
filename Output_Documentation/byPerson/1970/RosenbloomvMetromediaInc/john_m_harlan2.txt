justice
john
m.
harlan
every
day?
justice
john
m.
harlan
time
was
extended
to
public
figures
and
bodies--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
outcome
of
that
suit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
a
state
court
suit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what’s
the
number
of
that
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
count
from
the
record
i
assume
from
what
you
say
that
you
didn’t
try
the
case
below?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
indicate
in
your
account
for
this
$730,000
verdict?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down?
i’m
not
clear.
are
you
claiming
that
times
against
sullivan
rule
should
be
extended
to
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
your
argument
is
not
accepted,
the
new
york
times
would
not
be
accepted,
what
would
be
your
position
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
state
law,
libel
laws
of
peril
(inaudible)
or
that
there
should
be
some
special
constitutional
protection
as
to
listen
to
what
mr.
clark’s
argued
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
eight
women
on
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
go
back
to
something
you
have
said
yesterday
about
justice
brennan.
you
started
off
as
i
got
it
that
you
wrote
this
question
by
saying
that
you
recognize
at
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
rule,
federal
constitutional
rule
independently
of
state
law
was
necessary
in
the
case
like
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
you’re
not
--
you
don’t
stand
on
the
proposition
that
which
was
his
question
as
i
understood
it
that
whatever
state
law
maybe
in
this
none
public
figure
attitude,
state
laws
should
be
allowed
to
take
their
course?
you
don’t
argue
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
what
do
you
really
arguing
for
then
is
the
constitutional
rule
of
butts
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then
the
circumstance
that
pennsylvania
has
this
reasonableness
test
is
just
a
circumstance,
you’d
accept
that
as
the
constitutional
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
lesser
rule
would
be
adequate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
sure
your
preferences
on
constitutional
rules
is
called
for
federal
rules,
it
carries
with
it
i
think.
the
obligation
to
this
court
whatever
the
rule
is,
take
a
look
at
this
record
for
the
subject
for
itself,
after
what
we
said
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
and
what
we
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that’s
entirely
true.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
has
not
been
awarded.
you
think
that
this
record
would
sustain
any
constitutional
rule
except
the
$750,000.00
verdict?
justice
john
m.
harlan
new
york
times
verdict
as
i
recall
it,
my
recollection
was
$500,000.00
which
led
to
strenuous
events,
it
was
older
than
that
particular
constitution
rule
and
so
5852.
