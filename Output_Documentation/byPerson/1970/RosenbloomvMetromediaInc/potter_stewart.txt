justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
to
the
falsity
of
the
defamation,
ultimately
doesn’t
it,
the
fact
that
he
consulted
a
lawyer
and
that
he
to
be
sure
he
was
carrying
on
a
law
abiding
business?
justice
potter
stewart
that
damage
suit
was
a
suit
for
defamation
similar
to
this
one?
justice
potter
stewart
damage
from
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same,
was
it
the
same
district
judge,
in
both
cases
it
was,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
pocket
process,
well
this
is
in
the
federal
court
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it’s
not,
you
don’t
have
process
similar
to
new
york’s
filing
process?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
was
a
public,
the
complaint
was
a
public
document
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
then
that
means
mr.
segal
doesn’t
it
that
any
newspaper
or
radio
station
can
pick
out
any
one
of
the
two
hundred
million
joe
dokes’
in
the
united
states
and
just
by
the
fact,
you’re
picking
him
out
and
printing
a
news
story
about
him,
that
is
false,
a
false
into
the
story,
so
long
as
it’s
not
malicious
within
the
terms
of
new
york
times,
that
newspaper
is
absolutely
protected
though
it
falsely
defamed
him,
doesn’t
it
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
newspaper
itself
can
create
the
public
figure
in
your
situation.
take
any
little
joe
doke’s
in
the
country
and
create
immunity
for
itself
by
the
very
fact
you’re
publishing
a
false
story
about
him.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
under
our
system
of
free
enterprise
and
a
free
press,
it’s
up
to
these
newspaper
publisher
to
decide
what
he
thinks
that
the
public
has
the
right
to
know,
including
i
suppose
how
many
showers
joe
doke’s
took
this
afternoon
or
when
he
brushed
his
teeth?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
clark,
there
may
be
a
difference
between
a
newspaper
and
a
radio
in
this
respect
because
of
the
obligation
of
radio
to
give
equal
time,
an
obligation
that’s
not
shared
by
a
newspaper,
and
that
obligation
means
that
your
client
would
have
or
his
friends
and
supporters
will
have
access
to
the
radio,
wouldn’t
it,
on
at
least
very
station
to
express
his
point
of
view?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
understood
mr.
segal
to
say
and
i
--
perhaps
he
was
just
commenting
from
his
general
knowledge,
but
i
understood
him
to
say
that
the
record
showed
that
the
radio
stations
are
very
anxious
to
have
people
like
your
client
to
come
on
in
their
news
broadcast
and
he
can’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
it
may
have
to
do
with
the
difference
between
a
radio
and
a
newspaper.
a
newspaper
we
all
know
if
it
so
wishes
has
the
last
word,
it
prints
an
editorial
and
it
has
no
obligation
to
give
equal
time
and
equal
space
to
an
opposing
point
of
view,
but
a
radio
station
or
a
television
station
is
in
quite
a
different
legal
position,
it
has
an
obligation
to
make
its
own
facilities
available
for
an
opposing
point
of
view.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
think
it’s
just
sort
of
coincidence
that
the
pennsylvania
common
law
rule
happens
to
meet
your
view
of
what
the
federal
constitutional
standard
should
be?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
your
argument
was
at
least,
no
i
didn’t
think
so,
but
i,
you
can
certainly
make
the
argument
that
in
cases
of
private,
purely
private
--
suits
for
defamation
of
private
citizens,
the
federal
constitution
is
not
involved
at
all
but
if
it
is,
if
it
is
then
it
certainly
requires
no
more,
no
different
or
higher
or
more
stringent
standard
than
the
pennsylvania
common
law
rule
now
thus
provide.
frankly
is
what
i
thought
your
argument
was
before
the
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
mr.
clark
--
i’m
sorry,
excuse
me,
had
you
finished
your
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
you
it
to
be
your
view
that
there
is
no
constitutional
difference
between
defamation
published
or
uttered
by
a
newspaper
or
radio
station
and
news
program
on
one
hand
and
defamation
uttered
by
a
private
citizen
on
the
other?
in
other
words
if
i
say
our
neighbor
up
the
street
mrs.
jones
is
a
prostitute,
then
i’m
protected
by
the
first
amendment
even
though
that
is
false
so
long
as
in
the
exercise
for
ordinary
care
i
heard
she
was
and
just
casually
and
untruthfully
repeated
that
that
i
replayed.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don’t
distinguish?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
little
woman.
justice
potter

it
goes
