justice
thurgood
marshall
was
your
first
point
really
the
same
as
a
charge
that
the
government
hadn’t
provided
hearings
but
they
have
hearsay
hearings,
would
you
say
that’s
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
by
that,
in
this
instance,
i
gather
you
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
evidence
could
not
be
used.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
would
be
no
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
it
do
to
the
subpoena
to
the
doctors,
if
this
man
has
a
lawyer
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
for
a
moment,
if
you
subpoenaed
the
doctor,
do
you
think
that
you
would
be
able
to
shake
him
down
and
make
them
change
that
interest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
are
you
offering
experts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
did
you
offer
any
expert?
justice
thurgood
marshall
expert
in
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
you
prevented
from
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
the
proper
way
to
contradict
a
medical
testimony
by
your
cross
examination
that
could
be
done
by
contrary
affidavits?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
testify
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
on
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
when
put
on
government
lawyer
at
least
on
one
of
those
hearings
then
the
next
question
would
be
that
each
one
of
the
applicants
that
have
lawyers
to
represent
them
paid
for
by
the
government.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
with
that,
there
would
be
a
bigger
requirement
out
of
this.
if
you
raise
that
on
the
state
then
you
have
to
have
an
formal
fact
finder
presenting
the
evidence
and
gets
pretty
formal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
we
have
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
why
do
you
have
to
prove
that
you
object.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
examiner
do,
is
he
gets
the
medical
reports
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
takes
them,
he
reads
them,
and
puts
it
in
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
does
he
do
up
in
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
cross
examine
or
does
he
examine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
suppose
i
find
that
he
did
cross
examine
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
so
evil
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
this
case,
we
have
a
lawyer,
who
is
at
the
hearsay
testimony
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
just
trying
to
find
how
we
can
get
out
of
this,
particularly
what
you
said
in
this
argument
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)

gets
to
the
reports
of
these
doctors,
is
that
all
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
this
case
is
a
medical
adviser?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
says
you’ve
looked
over
this
with
your
expertise
and
give
me
your
impression
on
it
which
i
can
take
or
lead.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
how
do
you
extend
all
of
that
(inaudible)
the
evidence.
all
he
did
was
pick
up
what
was
mailed
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
this
case
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
get
out
to
gather?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
wasn’t
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
tinsman,
suppose
the
examiner
says
that
i'm
going
to
appoint
a
medical
advisor
and
i've
instructed
not
only
to
look
at
the
reports
but
to
personally
examine
the
man.
and
that
doctor
testified
is
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
difference
is
that
the
medical
advisor
didn’t
personally
examine
the
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
your
only
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
that
my
report
was
based
on
the
reports
of
the
other
doctors
plus
my
personal
examination
of
the
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
that
happens
to
agree
with
the
reports
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
you
don't
want
to
read
the
reports?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
satisfy
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
all
you
want?
