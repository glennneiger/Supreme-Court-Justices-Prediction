justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
have
any
real
objection
here
if
the
government
said
to
you
“look,
we
give
you
your
choice.
you
can
either
get
a
subpoena
out
to
the
doctor
or
not.”
now
you
have
got
your
choice
of
either
we
are
going
to
use
either
the
report
or
the
doctor
which
every
one
you
say.
now
we
are
going
to
--
i
mean
that
happens
to
be
the
rule
and
you
just
don’t
have
to
call
the
doctor
at
that
time
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
a
different
point
but
on
the
point
you
were
making,
would
have
any
real
complain
as
the
government
says?
you
just
tell
us
what
you
want,
the
report
or
the
doctor?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
always
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you’ve
got
an
expert
that
your
going
to
call?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
as
an
attorney?
would
you
demand
all
five
physicians
show
up
at
this
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
--
what
would
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
one
showed
up,
would
you
object
to
his
reference
to
the
reports
of
the
other
four?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
they
contained
what
they
usually
contain,
the
diagnosis,
would
you
object
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
want
--
in
this
case
you
would
insist
on
five
physicians
being
subpoenaed?
justice

r.
white
to
be
in
present.
justice

we
were
going
to
rely
on

is
tell
us
and
we
will
have
the
doctors
there
by
subpoena,

you
want
them?

that
the
practical
situation?

didn’t
even
ask
them.
