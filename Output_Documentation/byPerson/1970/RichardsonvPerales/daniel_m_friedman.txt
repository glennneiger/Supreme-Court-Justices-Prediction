mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
presents
an
important
question
as
to
the
evidence
that
maybe
utilized
by
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
in
disability
proceedings
under
the
social
security
act.
specifically,
the
question
is
the
correctness
of
a
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
written
reports
made
by
doctors
found
the
examination
of
the
patient
which
reflect
the
results
of
the
examination
and
the
doctor’s
analysis
and
conclusions
based
upon
that
examination
cannot
constitute
substantial
evidence
to
support
a
determination
of
disability
if,
one,
at
the
hearing
before
the
social
security
authorities,
the
claimant
objects
to
the
introduction
of
this
evidence.
and
two,
if
these
written
doctor’s
reports
are
contradicted
by
oral
testimony
given
at
the
hearing
by
the
claimant
and
the
claimant’s
doctor.
the
government
has
brought
this
case
to
this
court
because
of
the
serious
adverse
impact,
it
believes
this
rule
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
will
have
upon
the
operation
of
the
entire
social
security
disability
program.
there's
a
tremendous
number
of
these
administrative
hearings
conducted
each
year
in
disability
cases.
last
year,
our
figure
showed
that
27,000
of
these
hearings
were
held.
the
hearings
are
conducted
quite
informally,
they
are
not
adversary
in
characters,
we
know
the
term
and
the
examiner
who
presides
is
not
an
advocate
of
one
position
or
the
other.
he
attempts
to
develop
all
the
facts,
both
those
indicating
disability
and
both
--
and
those
questioning
disability.
now,
for
as
long
as
this
program
has
been
in
effect
for
at
least
15-years,
traditionally
these
cases
have
been
determined
on
the
basis
of
medical
reports,
written
reports
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
let
me
just
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
let
me
start
by
explaining
what
happened
perhaps
in
this
case.
this
man
filed
a
claim
for
disability
in
april
1966,
in
which
he
claimed
that
he
had
become
disabled
in
september
of
1965
as
a
result
of
a
back
injury.
before
he
had
actually
filed
his
claim,
he
had
undergone
some
treatment
which
had
been
unsuccessful.
and
when
he
flied
his
claim,
under
the
procedures
of
statutory
procedures,
the
claim
was
referred
by
the
social
security
agency
to
the
state
agency
that
handles
disability
problems.
in
this
case
the
texas
agency
and
under
the
statute,
the
statute
authorizes
the
secretary
to
enter
into
agreements
with
state
agencies
to
handle,
to
process
these
claims
originally.
the
state
agency
then
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
may
vary
some
but
the
basic
procedure
i
think
is
the
same
which
is
the
state
agency
makes
whatever
examinations
are
necessary
at
--
the
federal
government
pays
for
these
but
it
sends
the
man
out
for
medical
examinations.
in
this
case,
there
were
a
series
of
examinations
by
four
different
doctors.
first,
they
sent
the
man
to
an
orthopedic
surgeon
who
conducted
various
tests.
then
they
sent
him
to
a
neurologist,
following
that
they
also
had
--
i
might
mention
before
this.
they
also
attached
to
his
applications
were
various
reports
from
his
doctors
who
had
indicated
the
problems
they
saw.
and
at
an
early
stage
--
at
an
earlier
stage
before
he
filed
his
claim,
he
had
undergone
surgery,
something
called
a
laminectomy
for
this
pain
he
had
at
his
lower
back.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
may
i
give
the
chronology
of
what
happened
to
him?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
apparently
not,
apparently
not.
he
was
twice
hospitalized
by
the
orthopedic
surgeon
then
the
laminectomy
was
performed
and
following
this,
he
went
from
seeing
the
orthopedic
surgeon
he
consulted.
his
family
--
a
family
doctor,
dr.
morales
who
undertook
the
treatment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
he
was
a
neurosurgeon.
it's
a
doctor
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they
didn’t
find
much
they
thought,
and
this
is
one
of
the
points.
they
found
some
pressure
and
they
did
prescribed
certain
procedures
but
they
did
not
find
any
specific
neurological
involvement
of
the
kind
that
they
believe
would
cause
this
pain.
before
the
operation,
before
the
operation
the
neurologist
dr.
munslow
believed
there
was
some
problem
with
the
disc
but
apparently
the
laminectomy
did
not
disclose
that
fact.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
there
was
enough
there
apparently
to
suggest
that
they
performed
two
myelograms
before
the
surgery
and
the
first
one
is
not
on
the
record.
the
second
one
suggested
some
disc
involvement
but
apparently
after
the
surgery
was
performed,
they
did
not
find
anything
which
indicated
the
disc
involvement.
and
after
that,
the
man
put
himself
under
the
care
of
dr.
morales.
a
family
doctor
who
treated
him
more
conservatively
with
such
things
as
he
gave
him
some
x-ray,
not
x-ray
dp
therapy.
he
gave
him
drugs,
he
gave
him
pain
killers,
some
minor,
slight
exercise
and
so
but
none
of
these
conditions.
these
treatment
apparently
alleviated
his
pain.
so,
if
i
may
just
go
back
a
minute
to
what
happened
in
the
case
after
the
state
agency
has
examined
the
man.
the
state
agency
then
initially
at
least
decided
that
he
was
not
disabled.
and
subsequent
to
that,
he
then
said
he
wished
to
appeal
this
to
the
social
security
administration
after
the
state
agency
makes
the
initial
determination
which
they’re
permitted
to
do
under
the
stature
of
the
cases.
then
goes
back
to
the
bureau
of
old
age
and
disability
insurance
of
the
social
security
administration
which
makes
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
probably,
probably
and
mostly
i
think
in
almost
every
instance
where
the
state
agency
finds
the
man
is
disabled
social
security
administration
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
was
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
then
at
this
point
he
then
goes
to
the
social
security
administration
and
they
wrote
him
a
letter
which
is
pretty
much
a
form
letter
saying
that
the
examination
has
been
conducted
and
you’re
found
not
disabled.
and
then
i
said
you
have
certain
period
within
which
to
apply
for
reconsideration
and
he
applied
for
reconsideration.
and
after
he’d
applied
for
reconsideration
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
social
security
administration
by
the
bureau
of
disability
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
state
agency
is
out.
but
following
that,
following
that
and
before
--well
and
then
what
happened
is
reconsideration
was
denied
and
then
he
was
totally
had
the
right
to
request
a
hearing
and
he
requested
a
hearing.
now
between
that
period
and
before
the
hearing,
he
underwent
a
further
examination.
this
was
something
called
an
electromyographic
study
which
is
the
counterpart
of
the
electrocardiogram.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
done
at
the
instance
of
the
social
security
people
and
probably,
this
examination
was
conduced
and
then
he
had
a
hearing
as
he
had
requested.
now
at
the
hearing
he
was
represented
by
counsel
and
over
his
objection
there
were
admitted
the
six
doctors
reports
which
reflected
the
tests
that
had
been
made
by
these
doctors
during
the
series
of
examination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
examinations
were
made
not
by
--
let
me
make
this
clear.
they
were
not
made
by
the
state
agency;
they
were
all
made
by
independent
consultants
and
specialists
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they
were
referred
by
the
state
agency.
they
were
referred
by
the
state
agency
except
i
believe
for
the
electromyographic
study
but
paid
for
by
the
federal
government.
now
at
the
hearing,
testimony
was
presented
by
the
respondent
mr.
perales
by
mr.
perales’s
family
doctor,
dr.
morales
who
had
conducted
this
conservative
treatment
over
a
period
of
seven
months
by
a
fellow
employee
of
his,
by
a
vocational
advisor
who
testified
as
to
what
jobs
he
could
perform
and
by
a
man
that
the
examiner
had
called
who
was
known
as
the
medical
adviser.
now,
the
practice
in
these
cases
is
that
where
you
get
a
difficult
case,
where
the
examiner
feels
that
the
case
presents
medical
problems
that
are
somewhat
beyond
his
comprehension,
he
has
the
discretion
to
call
a
medical
adviser
to
advise
him.
it's
up
to
the
examiner
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
call
the
medical
adviser
and
medical
advisers
are
called
in
roughly
one
out
of
seven
cases.
the
medical
adviser
in
this
case
was
called
by
the
examiner
at
the
second
session
of
the
hearing.
first
session
was
held,
he
had
the
reports,
heard
the
testimony
and
decided
he
needed
some
assistance.
the
medical
adviser
was
a
dr.
leavitt
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
department
of
physical
medicine
at
baylor
university
medical
school
who
was
also
the
chief
of
staff
at
several
hospitals
and
a
consultant
to
the
va.
and
dr.
leavitt
was
sworn
as
a
witness,
dr.
leavitt
was
cross
examined
by
respondent’s
counsel
and
dr.
leavitt
explained
to
the
examiner
what
these
various
reports
were,
what
the
tests
were
in
one
case
and
explaining
the
consequences
of
the
electromyographic
study.
he
used
the
blackboard
and
drew
the
different
lines
and
graphs
to
show
precisely
what
the
effect
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
he
is
not
the
proponent
of
anyone,
he
is
an
object
--
he
tries
to
give
objective.
he
gives
objective
testimony,
he
interprets,
and
he
interprets
for
the
record,
for
the
examiner
what
the
medical
evidence
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
paid
by
the
government
or
rather
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
it's
a
rather
i
think
for
a
qualified
medical
--
he
gets
a
$125.00
for
appearing
as
the
medical
expert.
that
includes
studying
the
papers
before
the
hearing
and
testifying
for
as
long
as
he
has
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
$125.00
for
the
case,
that’s
all
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
cases
ordinarily
do
not
go
--
this
case
of
course
there
were
two
days
of
hearings
but
he
only
attend
one.
normally
these
hearings
just
take
up
a
couple
of
hours,
a
few
hours
at
most.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
they
have
in
each
city,
panels
of
different
experts
and
in
this
case
the
record
shows
that
the
examiner
did
not
select
the
particular
expert.
the
examiner
asked
his
assistance,
someone
called
a
hearing
assistant
to
select
a
doctor
from
a
doctor
from
a
panel
in
this
area
to
appear
some
medical
advice.
they
obviously
got
some
in
familiar
with
physical
problems
in
orthopedic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
varies,
again
it
depends
on
--
might
several
times
a
year,
it
might
be
just
once
or
twice.
again
it
would
depend
on
i
presume
on
how
many
cases
involving
the
particulate
type
of
condition
arose
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
which
she
is
a
specialist
arose
in
the
particular
locality
and
also
depending
on
the
examiner.
some
examiners
might
feel
the
particular
medical
problems
presented
a
case
that
they
could
handle
without
a
medical
adviser.
others
might
not
feel
that
confident
and
might
want
the
medical
adviser.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
this
doctor
was
a
specialist
in
something
called
physical
medicine
and
rehabilitation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
but
he
said
that
he
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
yes,
yes
it
does
and
he
just
advised
basically
advised
the
examiner
as
to
what
the
report
showed
and
what
the
significance
was.
now,
he
concluded
what
he
told
--
the
examiner’s
conclusion
was
that
these
reports
that
had
been
presented
and
the
evidence
adduced
at
the
hearing
indicated
that
mr.
perales
had
a
low
back
syndrome
of
mild
significance
--
mild
severance,
excuse
me,
that’s
what
he
said.
the
examiner
denied
the
claim,
he
said
that
on
all
the
evidence,
he
concluded
that
that
was
basically
what
the
man
had
was
this
low
back
syndrome
of
mild
significance
and
also
relying
on
certain
statements
made
by
the
psychiatrist
and
neurologist
that
there
was
an
emotional
overlay
to
this
illness
and
that
neither
of
these
factors
individually
are
in
combination
constituted
disability.
then
under
the
practice,
perales
brought
a
suit
in
the
district
court
to
set
aside
the
determination.
i
might
say
that
those
are
further
steps
in
the
interim
proceedings.
he
sought
review
of
the
examiner’s
decision
by
something
called
the
appeals
counsel
and
the
appeals
counsel
upheld
the
examiner’s
decision
and
under
the
statute,
that
then
became
the
final
decision
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case,
they
didn’t
hear
argument,
there
on
occasions,
they
do
hear
argument
but
in
most
instances
that
it’s
done
on
the
record
however
briefs
are
sometimes
filed.
i
don’t
believe
that
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case.
the
district
court
said
that
the
statements
and
the
written
reports
of
the
medical
advisers
were
not
substantial
evidence
and
that
the
testimony
of
the
medical
adviser
was
of
little
or
no
probative
value.
and
therefore
the
district
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
secretary
to
hold
a
new
hearing
before
a
different
examiner.
he
said
that
this
examiner
was
out
because
--
the
district
judge
a
month
before
this
hearing
had
condemned
the
use
of
these
medical
reports
and
despite
that
this
examiner
had
admitted
them.
and
so
he
said
there
had
to
be
before
a
new
hearing
and
the
indication
clearly
was
at
the
new
hearing,
only
the
doctor's
testimony
would
be
permitted,
not
the
reports
unless
the
parties
agreed
to
it.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
basically,
i
think
four
things.
first,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
in
view
of
a
provision
in
the
statute
that
the
rules
of
evidence
shall
not
be
binding
upon
the
secretary
in
these
proceedings.
that
the
medical
reports
although
hearsay
were
admissible.
that
was
the
first
thing
the
court
of
appeals
said.
secondly
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
under
the
regulations,
a
claimant
has
the
right
to
request
to
subpoena
witnesses
and
since
perales
had
never
sought
to
subpoena
the
doctors,
he
could
not
complain
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
cross
examine
the
doctors
because
he
hadn’t
sought
to
attempt
to
do
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
it’s
not
an
absolute
right,
the
--
in
effect
you
had
to
show
good
cause
and
the
practice
is
that
if
a
man
can
show
some
reason
why
it
is
necessary
to
call
the
doctor
to
the
stand.
for
example,
he
would
say
that
you
just
can't
tell
on
the
basis
of
these
tests
alone
what
his
condition
is.
that
the
significance
of
the
test
depends
upon
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
done,
how
long
you
lapsed
etcetera.
but
they
will
not
permit,
they
will
not
permit
into
subpoena
a
doctor
merely
because
he
says
he
wants
to
cross
examine
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
hadn’t
even
tried
and
then
they
went
on
however
and
said
that
despite
that,
nevertheless
because
the
doctor’s
statements
were
uncorroborated
hearsay,
that
could
not
constitute
substantial
evidence,
where
the
claimant
objected
to
the
introduction
of
the
reports
and
the
reports
were
contradicted
by
the
claimant’s
testimony
and
by
the
doctor’s
testimony.
the
court
also
said
that
it
agreed
that
the
medical
adviser
had
properly
been
permitted
to
testify
that
once
again,
his
testimony
was
properly
admitted
even
though
he
said
it
was
hearsay
because
it
was
built
and
turned
on
the
reports.
but
the
court
then
went
on
and
criticized
what
it
said
was
in
view
as
the
widespread
practice
of
these
medical
advisers
that
called
writing
the
circuit
with
the
examiners
for
the
purpose
of
reporting
on
the
condition
on
the
basis
of
the
reports
and
so
on.
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
this
procedure
should
be
frowned
upon
if
not
eliminated
entirely.
now,
and
that
therefore
affirmed
the
districts
court’s
decision.
i
want
to
stress
on
that
before
getting
into
the
discussion
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
neither
court
in
this
case
has
yet
passed
upon
the
question
whether
or
not
the
secretary
correctly
held
that
perales
was
not
disabled.
all
they
have
said
was
the
evidence
upon
which
the
secretary
based
its
decision
was
not
substantial
evidence.
we
don’t
know
in
this
case,
we
don’t
know
in
this
case
what
the
ultimate
outcome
will
be
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
government.
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
stand,
all
that
we
ask
is
the
case
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
court
now
to
review
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence
upon
which
the
secretary
based
his
determination.
i
make
this
point
because
some
of
the
amici
in
their
briefs
are
complaining
that
this
man
wasn’t
disabled
and
that
on
this
evidence
you
have
to
conclude
that
he
was
not
disabled
because
this
test
were
basically
unreliable.
that
is
an
issue
that
has
not
been
passed
upon
by
either
of
the
two
lower
courts.
now
i
would
like
if
i
may
just
briefly
to
indicate
the
importance
of
the
issue
before
coming
to
the
discussion
as
to
the
question
on
the
substantial
evidence.
as
i'd
indicated
earlier
in
my
argument
there
are
about
20,000
--
27,000
last
year
of
these
hearings
held
annually
and
since
the
program
has
been
in
effect,
they
have
always
relied
on
these
reports.
now,
the
doctors
have
been
very
cooperative
in
these
cases,
they
have
been
quite
willing
to
examine
the
people.
presumably
knowing
that
it's
only
going
to
be
in
the
unusual
case
when
they
will
be
asked
to
testify
and
the
secretary
has
some
information
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
if
this
rule
obtains
and
if
as
the
necessary
result,
there
going
to
be
have
to
be
a
great
deal
more
testifying
by
the
doctors
and
that
a
lot
of
doctors
who
have
headed
to,
been
willing
to
conduct
these
examinations
are
going
to
be
very,
very
reluctant
to
do
so
because
they
know
they
examine
a
man
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
making
tests
on
him.
and
so
the
end
result
of
this
maybe
that
several
months
later
they
will
find
themselves
forced
to
attend
a
hearing
at
some
distant
place.
perhaps
have
to
sit
for
a
whole
day
giving
--
listening
to
the
testimony,
then
giving
their
testimony.
now
not
only
will
this
make
and
this
reluctance
on
the
part
of
doctors
to
conduct
these
examinations
would
have
two
unfortunate
consequences.
first,
you
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
secretary
to
determine
this
vast
number
of
claims
and
secondly
in
the
long
run
we
think
it
would
re-down
to
the
detriment
of
the
claimants
themselves
because
the
majority
of
these
cases
in
which
claims
are
made
following
these
examinations,
the
claim
is
allowed
and
figures
out
roughly
two
thirds
of
all
claims
are
allowed
without
ever
going
to
hearing.
so
that
the
claimants
themselves
might
be
handicapped
if
the
doctors
would
generally
unwilling
and
reluctant
to
conduct
these
examinations
and
finally
we
read
in
the
papers
all
the
time
about
the
critical
shortage
of
physicians
in
this
country
today.
i
think
50,000
more
are
needed.
we
have
doctors
working
50
and
60
hours
a
week.
they
don’t
have
enough
time
to
see
patients
and
as
i
will
now
develop,
i
think
--
we
think
these
reports
are
thoroughly
reliable
and
that
really
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
that
the
doctors
should
spend
a
substantial
portion
of
their
time
particularly,
the
specialist
who
are
i
presume,
even
in
more
critical
short
supply
testifying
at
these
hearings.
now
in
the
social
security
act,
congress
has
provided
a
very
flexible
procedure
for
for
the
conduct
of
these
things.
i
might
just
mention
one
further
point
in
passing,
now
that
flexibility
which
has
characterized
these
proceedings
for
many
years
would
be
substantially
weakened
we
think,
if
everything
had
to
be
this
formal.
if
you
had
to
have
every
time
a
doctor’s
report
was
to
be
offered
in
evidence.
if
he
had
to
be
called
as
a
witness,
whenever
the
claimant
and
the
claimant’s
doctor
appeared
and
then
normally
of
course,
in
every
case,
the
claimant
appears
and
i
would
assume
this
got
to
be
the
rule.
the
normal
practice
would
be
that
the
claimant
would
always
have
his
physician
who
would
testify
and
then
it
would
be
necessary
to
call
all
of
these
doctors.
the
statute
gives
the
secretary
authority
to
provide
for
the
nature
in
extent
of
the
proofs
and
evidence
and
the
method
for
taking
and
furnishing
such
proof
and
evidence
in
disability
cases.
and
the
secretary
in
turn
of
his
regulations
leave
it
to
the
examiner
generally
to
determine
the
procedure
at
the
hearings
provided
that
the
procedure
will
afford
the
parties
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing.
and
as
i've
indicated,
the
statute
expressly
says
evidence
maybe
received
even
though
inadmissible
in
the
court
of
law
under
traditional
rules
of
evidence.
and
of
course
finally,
the
secretary’s
findings
if
they
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence
are
stated
by
the
statute
to
be
conclusive.
now,
substantial
evidence
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
it's
sufficient
to
support
an
administrative
determination
is
evidence
from
which
a
reasonable
mind
might
accept
as
adequate
to
support
a
conclusion.
evidence
as
it
stated
otherwise,
it
has
rational
probative
force.
and
we
think
under
this
standard,
these
reports
are
sufficient
to
constitute
substantial
evidence
and
of
course
i
won’t
debate
at
the
point
but
the
nature
of
this
statute,
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
secretary
makes
means
that
it's
to
the
secretary
to
decide
these
questions
to
evaluate
the
evidence
to
draw
inferences.
these
reports,
it
seems
to
us
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
whether
you
characterize
in
this
hearsay
or
non
hearsay
are
of
the
highest
probative
value.
let
for
a
moment,
let’s
just
look
and
see
what
these
reports
are.
the
reports
are
made
by
highly
skilled
professionals
in
the
performance
of
their
usual
duties.
this
is
what
a
doctor
usually
does,
he
examines
patients.
this
is
the
form
in
which
normally
a
doctor
reports
the
results
of
his
examination
and
the
results
of
his
diagnosis.
he
files
a
written
report.
the
reports
reflect
the
standardized
type
of
examination
and
medical
tests
that
doctors
traditionally
employ
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
a
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think,
what
i
would
say
is
that
these
technically,
probably
do
not
come
within
the
business
records
exception
because
they
are
made
in
response
to
an
individual
request
for
consultation
but
they
do
have
it
seems
to
me,
that’s
the
basic
thing.
it's
that
kind
of
reliability
and
we've
quoted
in
our
brief
a
fine
opinion
by
judge
parker
written
almost
40
years
ago
in
which
he
develops
in
considerable
detail
why
report
of
this
type
is
thoroughly
reliable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
hearings
--
the
hearing
serve
a
number
of
purposes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
we
do
find,
we
do
have
--
the
statistic
shows
that
roughly
one
third
of
all
the
cases
that
go
to
hearing
result
in
findings
of
non
disability.
we
have
a
statistic
in
our
brief
for
about
two
years
ago
there
are
roughly
20,000
hearings
in
that
year
and
i
think
6,900
of
the
cases
resulted
in
awards
to
the
claimant
so
that
in
one
thirds
of
the
cases
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
withstanding
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
like
this,
that’s
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
don’t
--
i
can't
say
that
there
will
be
unfavorable
reports
because
if
on
the
basis
of
the
reports,
it
was
decided
that
the
man
was
disabled
that
wouldn’t
be
a
hearing.
the
hearing
is
only
held
where
there’s
been
an
initial
rejection,
so
in
one
third
of
the
cases
--
and
the
evidence
for
example,
you
may
have
situations
in
which
the
man
brings
in
his
own
experts
who
explain
and
throw
some
doubt
about
these
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case
the
man,
mr.
justice
was
his
family
doctor
and
all
that
the
family
doctor
said
was
that
while
he
couldn’t
disagree
with
basically
with
the
reports
that
there
seemed
to
be
the
something
to
matter
with
this
man
which
in
his
view
indicated
he
couldn’t
work.
now
the
examiner
rejected
that
contention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
because
we
think
under
the
statute,
congress
is
basically
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
and
to
the
examiner
and
the
appeals
counsel
to
evaluate
the
evidence
to
weigh
it
and
to
compare
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that’s
right,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
because
we
think
that
in
the
majority
of
cases.
the
doctors
if
they
had
appeared
would
nearly
in
effect
repeat
what
they
had
stated
in
their
records.
and
i
think
that
is
the
point
that
judge
parker
made
so
effectively
in
his
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
the
claimant
may
--
if
i'm
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
if
i
may
with
the
court's
permission,
i
just
--
in
preparation
for
this
case
attended
the
disability
hearing
last
week
and
i
just
like
to
explain
what
happened
at
this
hearing
because
i
think
this
will
illustrate
it.
this
was
a
man
who
had
some
pulmonary
difficulties
and
the
question
was
whether
he
in
fact
had
tuberculosis
and
when
he
came
to
the
hearing,
he
was
very
short
of
breath.
and
this
was
noticed
by
the
medical
examiner
and
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
they
asked
them
about
this
and
they
asked
him
whether
he
walked
up
to
the
second
floor
or
taken
the
elevator
and
how
he
had
gotten
there.
and
during
the
medical
adviser’s
testimony,
the
medical
adviser
suggested
to
the
examiner
that
in
view
of
this
shortness
of
breathe
which
apparently
had
not
been
reflected
in
the
previous
reports.
that
he
suggested
appropriateness
of
performing
some
additional
tests
which
the
examiner
indicated
he
would
have
the
man
undergo.
now
this
it
seems
to
me
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
brought
out
at
the
hearing
which
may
serve
to
overcome
the
doctor’s
reports.
but
as
i
--
and
i
say
in
roughly
1/3
of
the
cases
this
happens.
but
our
basic
position
is
that
if
the
triar
of
the
fact
is
not
convinced
by
this
evidence.
if
the
triar
of
the
fact
just
concludes
on
balance,
the
record
is
enough
to
warn
a
conclusion
of
non-disability.
he
can
make
that
determination
even
though
the
basis
upon
which
he
makes
that
determination,
are
these
reports
made
by
the
doctors.
that’s
our
basic
submission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
might
--
there
might
be,
well
it's
hard
to
say.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which
i
think
would
be
unfortunate
certainly
and
--
but
i
also
suggest
that
there
might
be
fewer
awards
of
disability
for
another
reason
mr.
justice
is
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
doctors
to
make
the
examinations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
have
a
figure
on
that.
it's
rather
rough,
it's
about
540
or
560,000,
it's
roughly
two-thirds
of
all
applications.
i
can
give
you
the
figure
in
a
moment,
yes
it's
at
note
seven
pages
18
of
our
brief
and
there
were
in
the
fiscal
year
1968
515,000
disability
cases
were
processed
and
of
the
515,000
343,000
were
allowed
prior
to
hearings.
then,
out
of
the
remaining
160,000
that
were
initially
disallowed
only
20,000
went
to
hearing.
the
remaining
140,000
apparently
the
claimant
didn’t
wish
to
pursue
it
further
then
out
of
the
20,000
roughly
one-third
of
those,
that
went
to
hearing
resulted
in
awards
to
the
claimants.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right
and
these
are
all,
i
should
say
--
have
to
say
that
these
are
figures
which
have
been
supplied
to
us
by
the
department
of
health
education
whether
they’re
not
shown
by
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
are
public
records
but
they
may
have
involved
some
calculations.
i'm
sure
they’re
available.
i
don’t
know
exactly
where
they
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i
don’t,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
has
the
right
to
request
that
a
subpoena
be
issued
before
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
government
would
pay
whatever
the
usual
witness
needs
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
told
that
it's
relatively
rare.
the
doctors
generally
are
not
called,
i'm
also
told
that
what
frequently
happens
as
i've
indicated,
the
procedures
are
quite
informal.
and
what
sometimes
happen
is
if
the
claimant
indicates
he
would
like
to
have
a
doctor
and
gives
the
reasons
for
it,
without
a
formal
subpoena
being
issued,
the
examiner
has
someone
get
in
touch
with
the
doctor
and
arranges
for
the
doctor
to
appear.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right,
he
made
no
attempt
to
subpoena
the
doctor
and
under
the
regulations
he
can
see,
he
can
see
the
reports,
--
at
the
hearing
if
no
request
is
made,
customarily
these
reports
are
all
shown
to
the
claimant
in
advance
of
the
hearing
or
alternatively,
he
can
examine
the
reports
at
the
hearing
examiners
office.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
examinations
--
that’s
right.
there
were
that
number
of
examinations,
but
of
course
that
doesn’t
mean
that
almost
one
for
one
comparison
because
you
might
have
some
claimants
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
substantial
number
are
because
you
may
have
a
case
in
which
the
man’s
doctor
just
brings
an
evidence,
the
man
is
bedridden
and
has
been
bedridden
for
six
months.
i
mean
that
they
wouldn’t
press
that
anymore
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
claimant
wants
the
doctor?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
the
doctor
is
subpoenaed
you
mean?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
would
assume
that
would
they
first
present
the
report
and
then
the
doctor
would
testify
about
his
report.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
hearing
examiner
would
call
and
when
you
say
the
government
would
put
him
on,
i
mean
i
don’t
want
to
–
but
any
favor
comes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
not
precisely
mr.
justice.
this
is
not
an
adversary
hearing,
but
it's
not
on
the
one
side
of
the
government
and
on
the
other
side,
the
claimant.
thus
the
examiner
presides
informally,
people
sit
around
the
table.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you
mr.--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
i
think
another
five
minutes
would
certainly
be
plenty.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
just
make
three
little
factual
points.
first,
in
the
previous
discussion
over
the
role
of
the
examiner
in
this
case
i
want
to
make
it
clear
these
examiners
are
appointed
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they
are
the
typical
apa
examiners
who
presided
normal
agency
hearings.
they
are
not
under
the
control
of
the
sector
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
they
are
independent
examiners.
now
another
point
was
made
and
i've
been
advised
by
the
social
security
people
that
if
a
witness
is
subpoenaed
at
the
request
of
the
claimant.
the
government
will
pay
with
a
reasonable
fee
for
his
appearance.
i'm
also
told
that
if
a
request
is
made
to
examine
the
file
prior
to
the
hearing
and
if
the
hearing
examiner's
office
is
200
to
250
miles
away,
arrangements
can
be
made
to
temporarily
send
a
file
to
a
local
place
where
the
man
is,
so
that
the
claimant
or
his
attorney
can
examine
it.
now
finally,
i
think
it
is
important
and
on
the
two
aspects
of
the
case.
first,
on
the
medical
examiner's
testimony,
it
seems
to
me
that
basically
what
the
medical
examiner
is
doing
in
this
case
is
pretty
much
the
same
thing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
medical
adviser,
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke
myself.
the
medical
adviser
is
doing
this
case
with
any
expert
witness
is
doing.
the
only
difference
is
in
the
case
of
the
traditional
expert
witness
in
court
he
gives
his
opinion
in
response
to
a
hypothetical
question.
a
whole
string
of
hypothesis
have
put
together
and
i
take
it
if
in
his
case
the
examiner
had
attempted
to
summarize
the
medical
reports
that
have
bee
presented
and
then
to
summarize
what
had
been
testified
to
at
the
hearing,
there
will
no
objection
to
the
adviser
giving
his
expert
judgment
on
that
basis.
now
certainly,
in
this
kind
of
an
informal
procedure
that
we
have
in
these
hearings,
i
don’t
think,
there's
any
need
to
resort
to
such
formalism.
the
examiner
made
it
very
clear
in
his
questions
put
to
the
medical
examiner
that
he
was
asking
the
medical
examiner
to
give
his
opinion
on
the
basis
of
the
material
included
in
the
reports
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony.
and
to
whatever
extent
there
might
be
any
infirmities
in
the
reports,
to
whatever
extent
there
might
be
reasons
that
the
report
should
not
be
accepted,
that
was
clear
on
the
record.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
jury
having
to
have
medical
expert
opinion
solicited
on
the
basis
of
hypothetical
questions
because
otherwise
they
might
assume
facts
that
had
been
proven.
this
is
an
informal
administrative
proceeding.
now,
the
charge
has
been
made
here
that
the
examiner
is
unfair,
that
this
whole
proceeding
is
unfair
and
it
references
to
the
statement
of
the
need
for
cross
examination
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
the
statute
mr.
justice
says
that
the
secretary
shall
--
it
says
the
secretary
shall
have
full
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations
and
shall
adapt
reasonable
and
proper
rules
and
regulations
to
regulate
and
provide
for
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
proofs
and
the
evidence
and
the
method
of
taking
and
furnishing
to
say.
and
then
under
that
statute,
the
secretary
has
adopted
regulations
which
give
the
examiner
broad
authority
to
conduct
the
hearings
as
he
sees
fit.
and
he
says
that
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
examiner
to
determine
the
procedure
or
hearings
generally
provided
that
such
nature
is
for
the
parties
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing.
we
think
that
has
been
given
and
we
think
the
fairness
of
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
in
at
least
a
third
of
these
cases,
the
claimant
prevails
after
the
hearing.
and
i
suppose,
in
many
instances
it
maybe
that
when
the
examiner
sees
the
claimant
before
him,
he
gets
a
different
view
that
the
examiner's
judgment
as
to
what
the
report
show
and
what
their
significance
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
all
they
do
and
i
might
say
that
these
examiners
prior
to
the
time
they
start
on
the
job,
they
get
some
kind
of
a
course
in
which
they
get
some
basic
medical
information,
like
a
six
or
eight
week
course
in
which
they
are
instructed,
i
understand
by
various
specialists
in
the
field.
and
certainly
when
--
as
i
said
the
proceeding
is
not
an
adversary
one
and
the
failure
of
the
claimant
in
this
case
even
to
request
that
these
witnesses
be
made
available,
he
is
never
subpoenaed,
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals,
he
doesn’t
(inaudible).
the
court
of
appeals
itself
in
this
case
recognized
that
his
failure
to
call
the
witnesses
precluded
him
from
complaining
at
the
fact
they
weren’t
there
for
cross
examination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
in
effect,
i
would
think,
it
would
again
depend
on
what
kind
of
case
it
was.
there
might
be
some
problems
with
the
seventh
amendment
on
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
but
we
do
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
but
we
do
have
a
similar
kind
of
proceeding
mr.
justice
under
the
harbor
workmans
compensation
statute
which
traditionally
you
have
it
held
before
a
deputy
commissioner
and
that
is
there
are
two
parties
--
there's
usually
the
claimant
on
the
one
hand
and
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
government
case,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
that
is
right
this
is
the
government
and
the
government
i
think,
can
in
dealing
with
these
many
problems
resort
to
these
more
informal
procedures
that
have
been
developed
in
recent
years.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
presents
an
important
question
as
to
the
evidence
that
maybe
utilized
by
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
in
disability
proceedings
under
the
social
security
act.
specifically,
the
question
is
the
correctness
of
a
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
written
reports
made
by
doctors
found
the
examination
of
the
patient
which
reflect
the
results
of
the
examination
and
the
doctor’s
analysis
and
conclusions
based
upon
that
examination
cannot
constitute
substantial
evidence
to
support
a
determination
of
disability
if,
one,
at
the
hearing
before
the
social
security
authorities,
the
claimant
objects
to
the
introduction
of
this
evidence.
and
two,
if
these
written
doctor’s
reports
are
contradicted
by
oral
testimony
given
at
the
hearing
by
the
claimant
and
the
claimant’s
doctor.
the
government
has
brought
this
case
to
this
court
because
of
the
serious
adverse
impact,
it
believes
this
rule
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
will
have
upon
the
operation
of
the
entire
social
security
disability
program.
there's
a
tremendous
number
of
these
administrative
hearings
conducted
each
year
in
disability
cases.
last
year,
our
figure
showed
that
27,000
of
these
hearings
were
held.
the
hearings
are
conducted
quite
informally,
they
are
not
adversary
in
characters,
we
know
the
term
and
the
examiner
who
presides
is
not
an
advocate
of
one
position
or
the
other.
he
attempts
to
develop
all
the
facts,
both
those
indicating
disability
and
both
--
and
those
questioning
disability.
now,
for
as
long
as
this
program
has
been
in
effect
for
at
least
15-years,
traditionally
these
cases
have
been
determined
on
the
basis
of
medical
reports,
written
reports
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
let
me
just
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
let
me
start
by
explaining
what
happened
perhaps
in
this
case.
this
man
filed
a
claim
for
disability
in
april
1966,
in
which
he
claimed
that
he
had
become
disabled
in
september
of
1965
as
a
result
of
a
back
injury.
before
he
had
actually
filed
his
claim,
he
had
undergone
some
treatment
which
had
been
unsuccessful.
and
when
he
flied
his
claim,
under
the
procedures
of
statutory
procedures,
the
claim
was
referred
by
the
social
security
agency
to
the
state
agency
that
handles
disability
problems.
in
this
case
the
texas
agency
and
under
the
statute,
the
statute
authorizes
the
secretary
to
enter
into
agreements
with
state
agencies
to
handle,
to
process
these
claims
originally.
the
state
agency
then
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
may
vary
some
but
the
basic
procedure
i
think
is
the
same
which
is
the
state
agency
makes
whatever
examinations
are
necessary
at
--
the
federal
government
pays
for
these
but
it
sends
the
man
out
for
medical
examinations.
in
this
case,
there
were
a
series
of
examinations
by
four
different
doctors.
first,
they
sent
the
man
to
an
orthopedic
surgeon
who
conducted
various
tests.
then
they
sent
him
to
a
neurologist,
following
that
they
also
had
--
i
might
mention
before
this.
they
also
attached
to
his
applications
were
various
reports
from
his
doctors
who
had
indicated
the
problems
they
saw.
and
at
an
early
stage
--
at
an
earlier
stage
before
he
filed
his
claim,
he
had
undergone
surgery,
something
called
a
laminectomy
for
this
pain
he
had
at
his
lower
back.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
may
i
give
the
chronology
of
what
happened
to
him?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
apparently
not,
apparently
not.
he
was
twice
hospitalized
by
the
orthopedic
surgeon
then
the
laminectomy
was
performed
and
following
this,
he
went
from
seeing
the
orthopedic
surgeon
he
consulted.
his
family
--
a
family
doctor,
dr.
morales
who
undertook
the
treatment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
he
was
a
neurosurgeon.
it's
a
doctor
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they
didn’t
find
much
they
thought,
and
this
is
one
of
the
points.
they
found
some
pressure
and
they
did
prescribed
certain
procedures
but
they
did
not
find
any
specific
neurological
involvement
of
the
kind
that
they
believe
would
cause
this
pain.
before
the
operation,
before
the
operation
the
neurologist
dr.
munslow
believed
there
was
some
problem
with
the
disc
but
apparently
the
laminectomy
did
not
disclose
that
fact.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
there
was
enough
there
apparently
to
suggest
that
they
performed
two
myelograms
before
the
surgery
and
the
first
one
is
not
on
the
record.
the
second
one
suggested
some
disc
involvement
but
apparently
after
the
surgery
was
performed,
they
did
not
find
anything
which
indicated
the
disc
involvement.
and
after
that,
the
man
put
himself
under
the
care
of
dr.
morales.
a
family
doctor
who
treated
him
more
conservatively
with
such
things
as
he
gave
him
some
x-ray,
not
x-ray
dp
therapy.
he
gave
him
drugs,
he
gave
him
pain
killers,
some
minor,
slight
exercise
and
so
but
none
of
these
conditions.
these
treatment
apparently
alleviated
his
pain.
so,
if
i
may
just
go
back
a
minute
to
what
happened
in
the
case
after
the
state
agency
has
examined
the
man.
the
state
agency
then
initially
at
least
decided
that
he
was
not
disabled.
and
subsequent
to
that,
he
then
said
he
wished
to
appeal
this
to
the
social
security
administration
after
the
state
agency
makes
the
initial
determination
which
they’re
permitted
to
do
under
the
stature
of
the
cases.
then
goes
back
to
the
bureau
of
old
age
and
disability
insurance
of
the
social
security
administration
which
makes
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
probably,
probably
and
mostly
i
think
in
almost
every
instance
where
the
state
agency
finds
the
man
is
disabled
social
security
administration
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
was
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
then
at
this
point
he
then
goes
to
the
social
security
administration
and
they
wrote
him
a
letter
which
is
pretty
much
a
form
letter
saying
that
the
examination
has
been
conducted
and
you’re
found
not
disabled.
and
then
i
said
you
have
certain
period
within
which
to
apply
for
reconsideration
and
he
applied
for
reconsideration.
and
after
he’d
applied
for
reconsideration
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
social
security
administration
by
the
bureau
of
disability
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
state
agency
is
out.
but
following
that,
following
that
and
before
--well
and
then
what
happened
is
reconsideration
was
denied
and
then
he
was
totally
had
the
right
to
request
a
hearing
and
he
requested
a
hearing.
now
between
that
period
and
before
the
hearing,
he
underwent
a
further
examination.
this
was
something
called
an
electromyographic
study
which
is
the
counterpart
of
the
electrocardiogram.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
done
at
the
instance
of
the
social
security
people
and
probably,
this
examination
was
conduced
and
then
he
had
a
hearing
as
he
had
requested.
now
at
the
hearing
he
was
represented
by
counsel
and
over
his
objection
there
were
admitted
the
six
doctors
reports
which
reflected
the
tests
that
had
been
made
by
these
doctors
during
the
series
of
examination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
examinations
were
made
not
by
--
let
me
make
this
clear.
they
were
not
made
by
the
state
agency;
they
were
all
made
by
independent
consultants
and
specialists
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they
were
referred
by
the
state
agency.
they
were
referred
by
the
state
agency
except
i
believe
for
the
electromyographic
study
but
paid
for
by
the
federal
government.
now
at
the
hearing,
testimony
was
presented
by
the
respondent
mr.
perales
by
mr.
perales’s
family
doctor,
dr.
morales
who
had
conducted
this
conservative
treatment
over
a
period
of
seven
months
by
a
fellow
employee
of
his,
by
a
vocational
advisor
who
testified
as
to
what
jobs
he
could
perform
and
by
a
man
that
the
examiner
had
called
who
was
known
as
the
medical
adviser.
now,
the
practice
in
these
cases
is
that
where
you
get
a
difficult
case,
where
the
examiner
feels
that
the
case
presents
medical
problems
that
are
somewhat
beyond
his
comprehension,
he
has
the
discretion
to
call
a
medical
adviser
to
advise
him.
it's
up
to
the
examiner
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
call
the
medical
adviser
and
medical
advisers
are
called
in
roughly
one
out
of
seven
cases.
the
medical
adviser
in
this
case
was
called
by
the
examiner
at
the
second
session
of
the
hearing.
first
session
was
held,
he
had
the
reports,
heard
the
testimony
and
decided
he
needed
some
assistance.
the
medical
adviser
was
a
dr.
leavitt
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
department
of
physical
medicine
at
baylor
university
medical
school
who
was
also
the
chief
of
staff
at
several
hospitals
and
a
consultant
to
the
va.
and
dr.
leavitt
was
sworn
as
a
witness,
dr.
leavitt
was
cross
examined
by
respondent’s
counsel
and
dr.
leavitt
explained
to
the
examiner
what
these
various
reports
were,
what
the
tests
were
in
one
case
and
explaining
the
consequences
of
the
electromyographic
study.
he
used
the
blackboard
and
drew
the
different
lines
and
graphs
to
show
precisely
what
the
effect
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
he
is
not
the
proponent
of
anyone,
he
is
an
object
--
he
tries
to
give
objective.
he
gives
objective
testimony,
he
interprets,
and
he
interprets
for
the
record,
for
the
examiner
what
the
medical
evidence
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
paid
by
the
government
or
rather
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
it's
a
rather
i
think
for
a
qualified
medical
--
he
gets
a
$125.00
for
appearing
as
the
medical
expert.
that
includes
studying
the
papers
before
the
hearing
and
testifying
for
as
long
as
he
has
to
testify.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
$125.00
for
the
case,
that’s
all
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
cases
ordinarily
do
not
go
--
this
case
of
course
there
were
two
days
of
hearings
but
he
only
attend
one.
normally
these
hearings
just
take
up
a
couple
of
hours,
a
few
hours
at
most.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
they
have
in
each
city,
panels
of
different
experts
and
in
this
case
the
record
shows
that
the
examiner
did
not
select
the
particular
expert.
the
examiner
asked
his
assistance,
someone
called
a
hearing
assistant
to
select
a
doctor
from
a
doctor
from
a
panel
in
this
area
to
appear
some
medical
advice.
they
obviously
got
some
in
familiar
with
physical
problems
in
orthopedic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
varies,
again
it
depends
on
--
might
several
times
a
year,
it
might
be
just
once
or
twice.
again
it
would
depend
on
i
presume
on
how
many
cases
involving
the
particulate
type
of
condition
arose
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
which
she
is
a
specialist
arose
in
the
particular
locality
and
also
depending
on
the
examiner.
some
examiners
might
feel
the
particular
medical
problems
presented
a
case
that
they
could
handle
without
a
medical
adviser.
others
might
not
feel
that
confident
and
might
want
the
medical
adviser.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
this
doctor
was
a
specialist
in
something
called
physical
medicine
and
rehabilitation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
but
he
said
that
he
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
yes,
yes
it
does
and
he
just
advised
basically
advised
the
examiner
as
to
what
the
report
showed
and
what
the
significance
was.
now,
he
concluded
what
he
told
--
the
examiner’s
conclusion
was
that
these
reports
that
had
been
presented
and
the
evidence
adduced
at
the
hearing
indicated
that
mr.
perales
had
a
low
back
syndrome
of
mild
significance
--
mild
severance,
excuse
me,
that’s
what
he
said.
the
examiner
denied
the
claim,
he
said
that
on
all
the
evidence,
he
concluded
that
that
was
basically
what
the
man
had
was
this
low
back
syndrome
of
mild
significance
and
also
relying
on
certain
statements
made
by
the
psychiatrist
and
neurologist
that
there
was
an
emotional
overlay
to
this
illness
and
that
neither
of
these
factors
individually
are
in
combination
constituted
disability.
then
under
the
practice,
perales
brought
a
suit
in
the
district
court
to
set
aside
the
determination.
i
might
say
that
those
are
further
steps
in
the
interim
proceedings.
he
sought
review
of
the
examiner’s
decision
by
something
called
the
appeals
counsel
and
the
appeals
counsel
upheld
the
examiner’s
decision
and
under
the
statute,
that
then
became
the
final
decision
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case,
they
didn’t
hear
argument,
there
on
occasions,
they
do
hear
argument
but
in
most
instances
that
it’s
done
on
the
record
however
briefs
are
sometimes
filed.
i
don’t
believe
that
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case.
the
district
court
said
that
the
statements
and
the
written
reports
of
the
medical
advisers
were
not
substantial
evidence
and
that
the
testimony
of
the
medical
adviser
was
of
little
or
no
probative
value.
and
therefore
the
district
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
secretary
to
hold
a
new
hearing
before
a
different
examiner.
he
said
that
this
examiner
was
out
because
--
the
district
judge
a
month
before
this
hearing
had
condemned
the
use
of
these
medical
reports
and
despite
that
this
examiner
had
admitted
them.
and
so
he
said
there
had
to
be
before
a
new
hearing
and
the
indication
clearly
was
at
the
new
hearing,
only
the
doctor's
testimony
would
be
permitted,
not
the
reports
unless
the
parties
agreed
to
it.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
basically,
i
think
four
things.
first,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
in
view
of
a
provision
in
the
statute
that
the
rules
of
evidence
shall
not
be
binding
upon
the
secretary
in
these
proceedings.
that
the
medical
reports
although
hearsay
were
admissible.
that
was
the
first
thing
the
court
of
appeals
said.
secondly
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
under
the
regulations,
a
claimant
has
the
right
to
request
to
subpoena
witnesses
and
since
perales
had
never
sought
to
subpoena
the
doctors,
he
could
not
complain
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
cross
examine
the
doctors
because
he
hadn’t
sought
to
attempt
to
do
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
it’s
not
an
absolute
right,
the
--
in
effect
you
had
to
show
good
cause
and
the
practice
is
that
if
a
man
can
show
some
reason
why
it
is
necessary
to
call
the
doctor
to
the
stand.
for
example,
he
would
say
that
you
just
can't
tell
on
the
basis
of
these
tests
alone
what
his
condition
is.
that
the
significance
of
the
test
depends
upon
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
done,
how
long
you
lapsed
etcetera.
but
they
will
not
permit,
they
will
not
permit
into
subpoena
a
doctor
merely
because
he
says
he
wants
to
cross
examine
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
hadn’t
even
tried
and
then
they
went
on
however
and
said
that
despite
that,
nevertheless
because
the
doctor’s
statements
were
uncorroborated
hearsay,
that
could
not
constitute
substantial
evidence,
where
the
claimant
objected
to
the
introduction
of
the
reports
and
the
reports
were
contradicted
by
the
claimant’s
testimony
and
by
the
doctor’s
testimony.
the
court
also
said
that
it
agreed
that
the
medical
adviser
had
properly
been
permitted
to
testify
that
once
again,
his
testimony
was
properly
admitted
even
though
he
said
it
was
hearsay
because
it
was
built
and
turned
on
the
reports.
but
the
court
then
went
on
and
criticized
what
it
said
was
in
view
as
the
widespread
practice
of
these
medical
advisers
that
called
writing
the
circuit
with
the
examiners
for
the
purpose
of
reporting
on
the
condition
on
the
basis
of
the
reports
and
so
on.
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
this
procedure
should
be
frowned
upon
if
not
eliminated
entirely.
now,
and
that
therefore
affirmed
the
districts
court’s
decision.
i
want
to
stress
on
that
before
getting
into
the
discussion
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
neither
court
in
this
case
has
yet
passed
upon
the
question
whether
or
not
the
secretary
correctly
held
that
perales
was
not
disabled.
all
they
have
said
was
the
evidence
upon
which
the
secretary
based
its
decision
was
not
substantial
evidence.
we
don’t
know
in
this
case,
we
don’t
know
in
this
case
what
the
ultimate
outcome
will
be
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
government.
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
stand,
all
that
we
ask
is
the
case
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
court
now
to
review
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence
upon
which
the
secretary
based
his
determination.
i
make
this
point
because
some
of
the
amici
in
their
briefs
are
complaining
that
this
man
wasn’t
disabled
and
that
on
this
evidence
you
have
to
conclude
that
he
was
not
disabled
because
this
test
were
basically
unreliable.
that
is
an
issue
that
has
not
been
passed
upon
by
either
of
the
two
lower
courts.
now
i
would
like
if
i
may
just
briefly
to
indicate
the
importance
of
the
issue
before
coming
to
the
discussion
as
to
the
question
on
the
substantial
evidence.
as
i'd
indicated
earlier
in
my
argument
there
are
about
20,000
--
27,000
last
year
of
these
hearings
held
annually
and
since
the
program
has
been
in
effect,
they
have
always
relied
on
these
reports.
now,
the
doctors
have
been
very
cooperative
in
these
cases,
they
have
been
quite
willing
to
examine
the
people.
presumably
knowing
that
it's
only
going
to
be
in
the
unusual
case
when
they
will
be
asked
to
testify
and
the
secretary
has
some
information
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
if
this
rule
obtains
and
if
as
the
necessary
result,
there
going
to
be
have
to
be
a
great
deal
more
testifying
by
the
doctors
and
that
a
lot
of
doctors
who
have
headed
to,
been
willing
to
conduct
these
examinations
are
going
to
be
very,
very
reluctant
to
do
so
because
they
know
they
examine
a
man
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
making
tests
on
him.
and
so
the
end
result
of
this
maybe
that
several
months
later
they
will
find
themselves
forced
to
attend
a
hearing
at
some
distant
place.
perhaps
have
to
sit
for
a
whole
day
giving
--
listening
to
the
testimony,
then
giving
their
testimony.
now
not
only
will
this
make
and
this
reluctance
on
the
part
of
doctors
to
conduct
these
examinations
would
have
two
unfortunate
consequences.
first,
you
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
secretary
to
determine
this
vast
number
of
claims
and
secondly
in
the
long
run
we
think
it
would
re-down
to
the
detriment
of
the
claimants
themselves
because
the
majority
of
these
cases
in
which
claims
are
made
following
these
examinations,
the
claim
is
allowed
and
figures
out
roughly
two
thirds
of
all
claims
are
allowed
without
ever
going
to
hearing.
so
that
the
claimants
themselves
might
be
handicapped
if
the
doctors
would
generally
unwilling
and
reluctant
to
conduct
these
examinations
and
finally
we
read
in
the
papers
all
the
time
about
the
critical
shortage
of
physicians
in
this
country
today.
i
think
50,000
more
are
needed.
we
have
doctors
working
50
and
60
hours
a
week.
they
don’t
have
enough
time
to
see
patients
and
as
i
will
now
develop,
i
think
--
we
think
these
reports
are
thoroughly
reliable
and
that
really
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
that
the
doctors
should
spend
a
substantial
portion
of
their
time
particularly,
the
specialist
who
are
i
presume,
even
in
more
critical
short
supply
testifying
at
these
hearings.
now
in
the
social
security
act,
congress
has
provided
a
very
flexible
procedure
for
for
the
conduct
of
these
things.
i
might
just
mention
one
further
point
in
passing,
now
that
flexibility
which
has
characterized
these
proceedings
for
many
years
would
be
substantially
weakened
we
think,
if
everything
had
to
be
this
formal.
if
you
had
to
have
every
time
a
doctor’s
report
was
to
be
offered
in
evidence.
if
he
had
to
be
called
as
a
witness,
whenever
the
claimant
and
the
claimant’s
doctor
appeared
and
then
normally
of
course,
in
every
case,
the
claimant
appears
and
i
would
assume
this
got
to
be
the
rule.
the
normal
practice
would
be
that
the
claimant
would
always
have
his
physician
who
would
testify
and
then
it
would
be
necessary
to
call
all
of
these
doctors.
the
statute
gives
the
secretary
authority
to
provide
for
the
nature
in
extent
of
the
proofs
and
evidence
and
the
method
for
taking
and
furnishing
such
proof
and
evidence
in
disability
cases.
and
the
secretary
in
turn
of
his
regulations
leave
it
to
the
examiner
generally
to
determine
the
procedure
at
the
hearings
provided
that
the
procedure
will
afford
the
parties
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing.
and
as
i've
indicated,
the
statute
expressly
says
evidence
maybe
received
even
though
inadmissible
in
the
court
of
law
under
traditional
rules
of
evidence.
and
of
course
finally,
the
secretary’s
findings
if
they
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence
are
stated
by
the
statute
to
be
conclusive.
now,
substantial
evidence
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
it's
sufficient
to
support
an
administrative
determination
is
evidence
from
which
a
reasonable
mind
might
accept
as
adequate
to
support
a
conclusion.
evidence
as
it
stated
otherwise,
it
has
rational
probative
force.
and
we
think
under
this
standard,
these
reports
are
sufficient
to
constitute
substantial
evidence
and
of
course
i
won’t
debate
at
the
point
but
the
nature
of
this
statute,
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
secretary
makes
means
that
it's
to
the
secretary
to
decide
these
questions
to
evaluate
the
evidence
to
draw
inferences.
these
reports,
it
seems
to
us
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
whether
you
characterize
in
this
hearsay
or
non
hearsay
are
of
the
highest
probative
value.
let
for
a
moment,
let’s
just
look
and
see
what
these
reports
are.
the
reports
are
made
by
highly
skilled
professionals
in
the
performance
of
their
usual
duties.
this
is
what
a
doctor
usually
does,
he
examines
patients.
this
is
the
form
in
which
normally
a
doctor
reports
the
results
of
his
examination
and
the
results
of
his
diagnosis.
he
files
a
written
report.
the
reports
reflect
the
standardized
type
of
examination
and
medical
tests
that
doctors
traditionally
employ
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
a
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think,
what
i
would
say
is
that
these
technically,
probably
do
not
come
within
the
business
records
exception
because
they
are
made
in
response
to
an
individual
request
for
consultation
but
they
do
have
it
seems
to
me,
that’s
the
basic
thing.
it's
that
kind
of
reliability
and
we've
quoted
in
our
brief
a
fine
opinion
by
judge
parker
written
almost
40
years
ago
in
which
he
develops
in
considerable
detail
why
report
of
this
type
is
thoroughly
reliable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
hearings
--
the
hearing
serve
a
number
of
purposes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
we
do
find,
we
do
have
--
the
statistic
shows
that
roughly
one
third
of
all
the
cases
that
go
to
hearing
result
in
findings
of
non
disability.
we
have
a
statistic
in
our
brief
for
about
two
years
ago
there
are
roughly
20,000
hearings
in
that
year
and
i
think
6,900
of
the
cases
resulted
in
awards
to
the
claimant
so
that
in
one
thirds
of
the
cases
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
withstanding
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
like
this,
that’s
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
don’t
--
i
can't
say
that
there
will
be
unfavorable
reports
because
if
on
the
basis
of
the
reports,
it
was
decided
that
the
man
was
disabled
that
wouldn’t
be
a
hearing.
the
hearing
is
only
held
where
there’s
been
an
initial
rejection,
so
in
one
third
of
the
cases
--
and
the
evidence
for
example,
you
may
have
situations
in
which
the
man
brings
in
his
own
experts
who
explain
and
throw
some
doubt
about
these
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case
the
man,
mr.
justice
was
his
family
doctor
and
all
that
the
family
doctor
said
was
that
while
he
couldn’t
disagree
with
basically
with
the
reports
that
there
seemed
to
be
the
something
to
matter
with
this
man
which
in
his
view
indicated
he
couldn’t
work.
now
the
examiner
rejected
that
contention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
because
we
think
under
the
statute,
congress
is
basically
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
and
to
the
examiner
and
the
appeals
counsel
to
evaluate
the
evidence
to
weigh
it
and
to
compare
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that’s
right,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
because
we
think
that
in
the
majority
of
cases.
the
doctors
if
they
had
appeared
would
nearly
in
effect
repeat
what
they
had
stated
in
their
records.
and
i
think
that
is
the
point
that
judge
parker
made
so
effectively
in
his
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
the
claimant
may
--
if
i'm
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
if
i
may
with
the
court's
permission,
i
just
--
in
preparation
for
this
case
attended
the
disability
hearing
last
week
and
i
just
like
to
explain
what
happened
at
this
hearing
because
i
think
this
will
illustrate
it.
this
was
a
man
who
had
some
pulmonary
difficulties
and
the
question
was
whether
he
in
fact
had
tuberculosis
and
when
he
came
to
the
hearing,
he
was
very
short
of
breath.
and
this
was
noticed
by
the
medical
examiner
and
by
the
hearing
examiner
and
they
asked
them
about
this
and
they
asked
him
whether
he
walked
up
to
the
second
floor
or
taken
the
elevator
and
how
he
had
gotten
there.
and
during
the
medical
adviser’s
testimony,
the
medical
adviser
suggested
to
the
examiner
that
in
view
of
this
shortness
of
breathe
which
apparently
had
not
been
reflected
in
the
previous
reports.
that
he
suggested
appropriateness
of
performing
some
additional
tests
which
the
examiner
indicated
he
would
have
the
man
undergo.
now
this
it
seems
to
me
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
brought
out
at
the
hearing
which
may
serve
to
overcome
the
doctor’s
reports.
but
as
i
--
and
i
say
in
roughly
1/3
of
the
cases
this
happens.
but
our
basic
position
is
that
if
the
triar
of
the
fact
is
not
convinced
by
this
evidence.
if
the
triar
of
the
fact
just
concludes
on
balance,
the
record
is
enough
to
warn
a
conclusion
of
non-disability.
he
can
make
that
determination
even
though
the
basis
upon
which
he
makes
that
determination,
are
these
reports
made
by
the
doctors.
that’s
our
basic
submission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
might
--
there
might
be,
well
it's
hard
to
say.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which
i
think
would
be
unfortunate
certainly
and
--
but
i
also
suggest
that
there
might
be
fewer
awards
of
disability
for
another
reason
mr.
justice
is
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
doctors
to
make
the
examinations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
have
a
figure
on
that.
it's
rather
rough,
it's
about
540
or
560,000,
it's
roughly
two-thirds
of
all
applications.
i
can
give
you
the
figure
in
a
moment,
yes
it's
at
note
seven
pages
18
of
our
brief
and
there
were
in
the
fiscal
year
1968
515,000
disability
cases
were
processed
and
of
the
515,000
343,000
were
allowed
prior
to
hearings.
then,
out
of
the
remaining
160,000
that
were
initially
disallowed
only
20,000
went
to
hearing.
the
remaining
140,000
apparently
the
claimant
didn’t
wish
to
pursue
it
further
then
out
of
the
20,000
roughly
one-third
of
those,
that
went
to
hearing
resulted
in
awards
to
the
claimants.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right
and
these
are
all,
i
should
say
--
have
to
say
that
these
are
figures
which
have
been
supplied
to
us
by
the
department
of
health
education
whether
they’re
not
shown
by
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
are
public
records
but
they
may
have
involved
some
calculations.
i'm
sure
they’re
available.
i
don’t
know
exactly
where
they
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i
don’t,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
has
the
right
to
request
that
a
subpoena
be
issued
before
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
government
would
pay
whatever
the
usual
witness
needs
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
told
that
it's
relatively
rare.
the
doctors
generally
are
not
called,
i'm
also
told
that
what
frequently
happens
as
i've
indicated,
the
procedures
are
quite
informal.
and
what
sometimes
happen
is
if
the
claimant
indicates
he
would
like
to
have
a
doctor
and
gives
the
reasons
for
it,
without
a
formal
subpoena
being
issued,
the
examiner
has
someone
get
in
touch
with
the
doctor
and
arranges
for
the
doctor
to
appear.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right,
he
made
no
attempt
to
subpoena
the
doctor
and
under
the
regulations
he
can
see,
he
can
see
the
reports,
--
at
the
hearing
if
no
request
is
made,
customarily
these
reports
are
all
shown
to
the
claimant
in
advance
of
the
hearing
or
alternatively,
he
can
examine
the
reports
at
the
hearing
examiners
office.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
examinations
--
that’s
right.
there
were
that
number
of
examinations,
but
of
course
that
doesn’t
mean
that
almost
one
for
one
comparison
because
you
might
have
some
claimants
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
substantial
number
are
because
you
may
have
a
case
in
which
the
man’s
doctor
just
brings
an
evidence,
the
man
is
bedridden
and
has
been
bedridden
for
six
months.
i
mean
that
they
wouldn’t
press
that
anymore
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
claimant
wants
the
doctor?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
the
doctor
is
subpoenaed
you
mean?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
would
assume
that
would
they
first
present
the
report
and
then
the
doctor
would
testify
about
his
report.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
hearing
examiner
would
call
and
when
you
say
the
government
would
put
him
on,
i
mean
i
don’t
want
to
–
but
any
favor
comes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
not
precisely
mr.
justice.
this
is
not
an
adversary
hearing,
but
it's
not
on
the
one
side
of
the
government
and
on
the
other
side,
the
claimant.
thus
the
examiner
presides
informally,
people
sit
around
the
table.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you
mr.--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
i
think
another
five
minutes
would
certainly
be
plenty.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
just
make
three
little
factual
points.
first,
in
the
previous
discussion
over
the
role
of
the
examiner
in
this
case
i
want
to
make
it
clear
these
examiners
are
appointed
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they
are
the
typical
apa
examiners
who
presided
normal
agency
hearings.
they
are
not
under
the
control
of
the
sector
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
they
are
independent
examiners.
now
another
point
was
made
and
i've
been
advised
by
the
social
security
people
that
if
a
witness
is
subpoenaed
at
the
request
of
the
claimant.
the
government
will
pay
with
a
reasonable
fee
for
his
appearance.
i'm
also
told
that
if
a
request
is
made
to
examine
the
file
prior
to
the
hearing
and
if
the
hearing
examiner's
office
is
200
to
250
miles
away,
arrangements
can
be
made
to
temporarily
send
a
file
to
a
local
place
where
the
man
is,
so
that
the
claimant
or
his
attorney
can
examine
it.
now
finally,
i
think
it
is
important
and
on
the
two
aspects
of
the
case.
first,
on
the
medical
examiner's
testimony,
it
seems
to
me
that
basically
what
the
medical
examiner
is
doing
in
this
case
is
pretty
much
the
same
thing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
medical
adviser,
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke
myself.
the
medical
adviser
is
doing
this
case
with
any
expert
witness
is
doing.
the
only
difference
is
in
the
case
of
the
traditional
expert
witness
in
court
he
gives
his
opinion
in
response
to
a
hypothetical
question.
a
whole
string
of
hypothesis
have
put
together
and
i
take
it
if
in
his
case
the
examiner
had
attempted
to
summarize
the
medical
reports
that
have
bee
presented
and
then
to
summarize
what
had
been
testified
to
at
the
hearing,
there
will
no
objection
to
the
adviser
giving
his
expert
judgment
on
that
basis.
now
certainly,
in
this
kind
of
an
informal
procedure
that
we
have
in
these
hearings,
i
don’t
think,
there's
any
need
to
resort
to
such
formalism.
the
examiner
made
it
very
clear
in
his
questions
put
to
the
medical
examiner
that
he
was
asking
the
medical
examiner
to
give
his
opinion
on
the
basis
of
the
material
included
in
the
reports
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony.
and
to
whatever
extent
there
might
be
any
infirmities
in
the
reports,
to
whatever
extent
there
might
be
reasons
that
the
report
should
not
be
accepted,
that
was
clear
on
the
record.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
jury
having
to
have
medical
expert
opinion
solicited
on
the
basis
of
hypothetical
questions
because
otherwise
they
might
assume
facts
that
had
been
proven.
this
is
an
informal
administrative
proceeding.
now,
the
charge
has
been
made
here
that
the
examiner
is
unfair,
that
this
whole
proceeding
is
unfair
and
it
references
to
the
statement
of
the
need
for
cross
examination
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
the
statute
mr.
justice
says
that
the
secretary
shall
--
it
says
the
secretary
shall
have
full
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations
and
shall
adapt
reasonable
and
proper
rules
and
regulations
to
regulate
and
provide
for
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
proofs
and
the
evidence
and
the
method
of
taking
and
furnishing
to
say.
and
then
under
that
statute,
the
secretary
has
adopted
regulations
which
give
the
examiner
broad
authority
to
conduct
the
hearings
as
he
sees
fit.
and
he
says
that
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
examiner
to
determine
the
procedure
or
hearings
generally
provided
that
such
nature
is
for
the
parties
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing.
we
think
that
has
been
given
and
we
think
the
fairness
of
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
in
at
least
a
third
of
these
cases,
the
claimant
prevails
after
the
hearing.
and
i
suppose,
in
many
instances
it
maybe
that
when
the
examiner
sees
the
claimant
before
him,
he
gets
a
different
view
that
the
examiner's
judgment
as
to
what
the
report
show
and
what
their
significance
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
all
they
do
and
i
might
say
that
these
examiners
prior
to
the
time
they
start
on
the
job,
they
get
some
kind
of
a
course
in
which
they
get
some
basic
medical
information,
like
a
six
or
eight
week
course
in
which
they
are
instructed,
i
understand
by
various
specialists
in
the
field.
and
certainly
when
--
as
i
said
the
proceeding
is
not
an
adversary
one
and
the
failure
of
the
claimant
in
this
case
even
to
request
that
these
witnesses
be
made
available,
he
is
never
subpoenaed,
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals,
he
doesn’t
(inaudible).
the
court
of
appeals
itself
in
this
case
recognized
that
his
failure
to
call
the
witnesses
precluded
him
from
complaining
at
the
fact
they
weren’t
there
for
cross
examination.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
in
effect,
i
would
think,
it
would
again
depend
on
what
kind
of
case
it
was.
there
might
be
some
problems
with
the
seventh
amendment
on
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
but
we
do
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
but
we
do
have
a
similar
kind
of
proceeding
mr.
justice
under
the
harbor
workmans
compensation
statute
which
traditionally
you
have
it
held
before
a
deputy
commissioner
and
that
is
there
are
two
parties
--
there's
usually
the
claimant
on
the
one
hand
and
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
government
case,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
that
is
right
this
is
the
government
and
the
government
i
think,
can
in
dealing
with
these
many
problems
resort
to
these
more
informal
procedures
that
have
been
developed
in
recent
years.
thank
you.
