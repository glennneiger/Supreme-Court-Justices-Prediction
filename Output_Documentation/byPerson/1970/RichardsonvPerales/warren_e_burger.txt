chief

warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
108,
richardson
against
perales.
mr
.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
mr.
friedman
that
they
have
the
same
hallmarks
of
reliability
that
the
day-to-day
recording
and
recordings
by
doctors
and
medical
records
have
in
hospital
procedure
which
are
admissible
under
the
conventional
rules?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
mr.
friedman,
you
mentioned
that
there
were
20,000
hearings
last
year
and
6,900
favorable
to
the
claimant
after
hearing.
do
you
have
any
figure
in
this
record
as
to
how
many
grants
in
favor
of
the
claimant
were
made
without
going
to
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
are
the
figures
are
all
in
one
place
on
page
18,
is
that
right,
concentrated
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they’re
public
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they’re
public
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
mr.
tinsman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
when
a
back
effusion
is
done,
the
spinal
effusion
is
done
that
proves
that
it
should
have
been
done.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
made
the
point
that
there
should
be
an
independent
hearing
examiner
for
each
one
of
these
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
contain
any
estimate
as
to
how
many
hearing
examiners
it
would
take
to
handle
the
20,000
hearings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
apply
to
figure
out
how
many
hearing
examiners
we
need
to
hear
these
20,000
cases
each
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
you
got
to
get
some
more
people
to
take
the
place
of
those
bodies.
you’d
have
to
get
some
lawyers
to
do
what
the
hearing
examiner
now
does
for
the
social
security
department,
wouldn’t
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
stayed
on
as
lawyers
is
there
any
figure
as
to
how
many
examiners
you
would
need?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
reference
to
the
goldberg
case
confuses
me
a
little
bit.
mr.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
on
the
goldberg
case
didn’t
prescribe
the
kind
of
examiner
you
are
talking
about.
he
merely
said,
as
i
recall
it,
that
once
the
benefits
have
been
declined
by
one
member
of
the
staff
of
the
agency,
then
the
review
of
that
must
be
by
a
different
member
of
the
staff.
now
that’s
not
the
kind
of
an
independent
examiner
you’re
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
has
to
relate
that
to
what
was
decided
by
the
court
in
the
case.
it
merely
said
a
different
member
of
the
staff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
left
five
minutes
after
lunch,
if
you
find
that
our
questioning
has
discommoded
your
argument
we
might
add
a
little
bit
to
that
if
you
need
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
you
will
need
any
more
than
the
five
minutes
you
have
remaining?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we’ll
give
you
three.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
notice,
he
said
almost.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
in
every
situation
and
you
have
to
read
that
in
the
light
of
what
was
decided
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
namely
that
the
hearing
officers
were
not
totally
independent.
it
wasn’t
the
total
adversary
due
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
his
own
physician
indicated
that
there
was
some
psychosomatic
involvement
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tinsman,
what
would
you
say
if
instead
of
calling
these
--
using
these
panels
of
doctors,
specialists
if
these
matters
were
referred
to
the
panel
of
specialists
to
act
as
triers
and
let
make
them
make
the
decision,
you
wouldn’t
expect
that
you
could
cross
examine
a
hearing
officer
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
was
unconstitutional
or
otherwise
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
that’s
--
you
see
no
objection
in
the
statute
of
the
constitution
to
having
filed
in
a
situation
like
this
referred
to
the
doctors
and
let
their
decision
be
made
as
the
determiners
and
triers
of
the
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn’t
quite
put
it
that
way
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
tinsman.
mr.
friedman
we've
gone
considerably
over,
if
you
have
some
more
observations
we’ll
give
you
some
additional
time
here.
chief

warren
e.
burger
how
much
do
you

would
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
