do
you
have
any
idea,
how
those
figures
compare
with
the
figures
that
would
apply
to
private
insurance
companies,
you
have
brought
into
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
gist
of
your
complaints
about
the
hearsay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
argue
that
in
suits
again
when
the
government
is
consented
to
be
sued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
what
this
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
to
the
suit
against
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
subject
the
government
to
the
same
kind
of
constitution
or
rule
where
it
can
be
consent
to
be
a
sued
or
not
as
it
seems
here,
as
you
are
a
private
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
suit
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
have
been
the
intent
of
the
doctor
to
testify.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment,
does
the
trouble
he
had
to
have
been
medically
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
you
say
caused
the
sprain?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
your
brief,
whether
you
believe
that
the
aba
applies
or
should
be
barred
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
suppose
you
are
free
here
to
defend
the
judgment
you
want
below
on
the
ground
which
they
didn’t
decide
in
your
favor
if
you
want
to,
right.
do
you
want
to
take
the
position
with
us
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
why
do
you
say
that
because
it
applies,
here
hearsay
would
be
admissible
but
it's
subject
to
cross
examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
doesn’t
include
you
relying
on
up
here.
justice

(inaudible)
justice
hugo

i
suggest
to
you
again
that
it's
a

that
you’re
defending
a

below
you
have
now
the
opinion
other
than

justice

what
does
he
do
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
way
who
has
got
the
burden
of
proof,
the
claimant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
had
the
government
asking
you
to
prove
your
case
is
that
really
turning
things
around?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
congress
has
passed
a
law
and
allowed
these
people
to
sue
in
court
but
provided
in
the
law
hearsay
evidence
would
be
admissible.
justice

medical
adviser
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
does
the

use
the
word
unfair?

what
if
the
congress
had
passed
a

providing
cases
against
private
insurance
companies
could
be
tried

would
you
say
about
that?

it
would
