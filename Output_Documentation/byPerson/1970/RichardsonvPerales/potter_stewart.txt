justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman,
how
does
it
all
start?
someone
has
claimed
disability?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
disability?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
procedures
by
which
they’re
handled
differed
depending
upon
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
he’s
paid
--
he’s
paid
by
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
get
it
per
dime
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
$25.00
a
day
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
long
as
the
case
goes
on.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he’s
a
member
of
a
panel
that
has
been
sort
of
volunteers
in
response
to
request
for
volunteers?
justice
potter
stewart
how
often
would
anyone
medical
advisor
do
this
job
over
the
course
of
the
year?
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
he
is
a
specialist.
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
particular
doctor
a
specialist
or
a
generalist?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
--
that’s
not
neurosurgery
or
neurology
or
orthopedics.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
an
absolute
right
to
subpoena
mr.
friedman?
justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly,
it's
point
was
that
he
hadn't
even
tried.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
mr.
friedman,
this
number
a
year
i
suppose
it's
hard
to
answer
this
but
do
not
those
reports
then
really
determine
the
basic
issue
of
disability.
what
purpose
does
the
hearing
serve?
justice
potter
stewart
well
let
me
put
it
this
way,
are
there
instances
in
which
notwithstanding
reports
is
unfavorable
to
the
disability
claim
as
these
were
as
interpreted
by
the
medical
adviser?
how
many
cases
nevertheless
result
the
findings
of
disability?
justice
potter
stewart
not
withstanding
medical
--
justice
potter
stewart
like
this.
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
unfavorable
to
the
claim
as
he
is
apparently
were?
justice
potter
stewart
like
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
gather
no
matter
how
many
experts
he
may
bring
in,
who
would
testify
that
indeed
there
is
disability.
nevertheless,
the
government’s
position
would
be
if
the
examiner
finds
there's
not,
these
reports
constitute
substantial
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it’s
a
physical
case
where
it
goes
to
hearing
where
there’s
been
medical
reports
adverse
to
the
claimant
and
yet
an
award
of
disability
has
been
made,
it
must
because
the
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
presents
at
the
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
which
serves
to
override
his
reports.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
arguably
that
if
the
government
called
doctors,
their
own
doctors
who
would
make
these
reports
on
every
hearing
it
might
be
pure
award
of
disability.
justice
potter
stewart
or
there
would
be
then
personal
confrontation
between
doctors
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman
how
often
do
you
know
that
--
do
you
know
does
a
claimant
attempt
to
call
the
witness.
one
of
the
doctors
who
has
filed
an
adverse
report,
i
take
it
that
he
has
the
right
to
call
him,
doesn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
is
given
proper
treatment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
was
there
for
cross
examination,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
the
administrative
determination
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
potter
stewart
well
not
necessarily,
they
are
sent
back
for
reevaluation
many
times
and
referred
for
further
hearing,
this
doesn’t
follow
what
you
said.
now,
let
me
ask
you
this,
why
did
you
not
call
a
specialist?
justice
potter
stewart
you
feel
you
have
made
your
case
with
the
general
practitioner's
testimony
on
as
elusive
a
subject
as
back
injury?
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
the
injury
incurred
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
he
worked
at
all
since
then?
justice
potter
stewart
don’t
you
think
the
--
let
me
track
you
down
on
that.
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
because
he
had
efeffusion?
is
that
what
you’re
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
might
have
felt,
it
might
help
this
man
in
some
way
knowing
he
had
effusion.
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
was
in
there,
he
was
in
the
back.
justice
potter
stewart
and
many
times
did
they
not
make
effusion
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
eliminate
his
pain?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
the
third
grade
education
have
to
do
with
his
pain?
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
isn’t
in
the
record
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
more
that
constitutional
or
is
it
done
that
way
anywhere
else?
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
this
procedure
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
cases
that
mr.
justice
brennan
decided
was
the
wang
yang
case?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn’t
it
constitutional
holding
though?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
required
this,
you
mean
what?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
wasn’t
a
constitutional
decision,
the
wang
yang.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
as
we
left
that
you
were
not
relying
upon
the
apa?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
the
provision
and
i
asked
you
about
the
cross
examination
and
you
said
that
was
not
provided.
justice
potter
stewart
section
7
(d)
is
the
one
that
i
was
referring.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
what
it
says
but
you
were
--
you
said
you
were
not
relying
upon
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
it’s
the
same
as
in
the
social
security
act,
i
don’t
find
it
in
the
social
security
act.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
even
defend
on
the
ground
that
it's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
that’s
much
difference
why
didn’t
you
call
a
doctor?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
government
would
pay
him?
justice
potter
stewart
do
social
security
taxes
support
disability?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
your
client
has
been
making
contributions
toward
disability
as
well
as
the
other
benefits.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
happen
to
these
doctors,
the
government
might
well
putting
on
in
the
case
or
there
is
any
formality
at
all,
the
government
might
prefer
that
have
relied
testimony
of
the
doctor
if
he
was
there.
