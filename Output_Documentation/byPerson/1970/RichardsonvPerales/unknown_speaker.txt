does
the
record
show
he’s
board
certified
in
physical
medicine?
unknown
speaker
it
appears
counsel
hear
argument
or
it
they
hear
the
appeal
on
the
record?
unknown

just
as
though
those
doctors
who
wrote
the
report
had
come
to
testify
it
personally.

and
if
he
is
still
has
to
pay
--
unknown
speaker
and
are
doctors
often
called
by
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
think
this
claimant
had
the
choice
of
either
being
faced
with
the
written
reports
or
calling
the
doctor
himself.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
i
noticed
that,
i
gather
out
of
that
515,000
disability
claim
that
320,164
consultant
examinations
is
that
right?
footnote

page
18.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
would
appear
that
great
many
disability
claims
are
allowed
without
a
consultant.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question,
is
that
if
the
claimant
calls
the
doctor,
is
the
government
required
or
is
it
likely
to
call
the
doctor
to
give
testimony,
if
he’s
there
at
hearing
rather
than
to
present
his
report?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
claimant
asks
for
a
subpoena,
the
doctor
is
there
at
the
hearing.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
government
wouldn’t
put
him
on.
unknown
speaker
this
does
not
mean
an
adversary
hearing.
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tinsman,
let
me
bring
you
back
to
the
merits.
how
many
specialists
had
reports
in
this
man's
file
on
him?
unknown
speaker
how
many,
how
many?
unknown
speaker
four.
unknown
speaker
you
didn’t
choose
to
ask
them
to
be
there
either.
all
you
had
to
do
is
say
so
and
they
would
have
been
there.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
and
you
had
--
you
tell
me
that
you
would
always
have
the
doctor
there,
if
you
thought
that
doctor
is
going
to
hurt
you,
you
would
not
have
him
there,
because
he’s
going
to
help
you,
you
would
have
him
there.
unknown
speaker
all
you
had
to
do
is
ask
as
far
as
we
know
the
government
would
have
had
the
doctor
there
and
you
did
not
ask.
unknown
speaker
well
then
why
didn’t
you
ask
the
doctor
to
be
there?
unknown
speaker
well
i
don’t
know
how
you
stick
with
the
government
with
some
agreement
by
your
local
bar
association
that
you
pay
doctors.
and
if
you
issue
subpoena
for
the
doctor,
he’s
going
to
show
up.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
due
process
claim
on
that.
unknown
speaker
did
they
tell
you
in
advance,
we
are
going
to
rely
on
the
written
reports
unless
you
want
the
live
testimony
there.
now
if
you
want
the
doctors
there
you
just
tell
us
we’ll
have
him
there
even
before
the
hearing
even
starts.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
you
didn’t
know
you
have
the
right
to
subpoena
the
doctor?
unknown
speaker
you
know
choice
you
had?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
he’s
board
certified
in
physical
medicine?
unknown
speaker
it
appears
counsel
hear
argument
or
it
they
