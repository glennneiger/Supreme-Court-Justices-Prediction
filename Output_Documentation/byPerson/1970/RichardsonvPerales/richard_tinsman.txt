mr.
richard
tinsman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
issue
to
be
decided
here
is
this
limited
one,
where
each
side
has
directly
contrary
evidence
on
the
crucial
issue
to
be
decided
in
this
particular
case.
disability
of
the
claimant
and
it's
directly
in
conflict
what
procedure
should
be
involved?
the
one
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
mandated
where
the
government
must
bring
in
their
doctors,
their
evidence
or
the
one
that
has
been
followed
in
the
past.
now
mr.
justice
brennan
indicated
this
is
not
an
adversary
procedure.
this
is
the
position
that
has
been
taken
by
the
government
but
of
it's
very
nature
this
is
an
adversary
procedure
because
the
government
on
one
hand
has
reports
that
say
this
man
is
not
disabled.
the
man
says
those
reports
are
wrong,
i
am
disabled
and
my
doctor
says
i
am
disabled,
so
we
really
can't
characterize
this
as
not
an
adversary
proceeding
of
its
very
nature.
it
must
be,
because
it
is
a
disability
hearing
where
there
are
two
doctors,
who
are
directly
in
conflict.
and
the
problem
in
social
security
hearings
is
there
must
be
total
and
complete
disability.
not
as
in
some
programs
as
in
veterans
programs
where
there
might
be
partial
disability.
now,
we
start
out
with
a
basic
proposition
that
has
been
enunciated
by
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
that
say
they’re
all
cited
by
the
fifth
circuit.
one
of
them
is
consolidated
edison
versus
to
national
labor
relations
board
that
says
uncorroborated
hearsay
does
not
constitute
substantial
evidence.
and
then
this
court
has
in
many
cases
brought
forward
the
proposition
that
the
right
of
confrontation
and
cross
examination
even
in
administrative
hearings
is
a
basic
right
that
a
person
has.
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
actually
have
three
points
that
i’d
like
to
bring
out
mr.
justice
black.
first
is
that
--
and
the
most
primary
one
which
as
the
fifth
circuit
decided
on
is
that
these
hearsay
reports
are
not
substantial
evidence
and
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
so.
the
second
point
that
we
will
make
in
the
argument
is
this
medical
adviser
situation
where
the
man
has
never
examined
the
man
is
improper.
and
the
third
point
that
we
will
make
and
have
made
in
our
brief
is
that
the
whole
procedure
that
is
presently
followed
by
social
security
violates
due
process
and
that
the
hearing
examiner
is
both
the
government’s
attorney
and
then
he
becomes
the
judge
and
he
is
not
an
impartial
fact
finder
as
has
been
required
by
the
court
in
past
situations.
i
would
like
to
first
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
because,
generally
in
the
suits
where
the
government
consented
to
be
sued,
we
have
an
impartial
fact
finder
and
that’s
the
federal
district
judge.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
your
honor
in
the
suits
of
federal
court
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
but
the
hearing
examiner
must
be
the
government’s
lawyer
as
well
as
the
judge.
he
first
puts
on
the
government
lawyer
hat
and
then
after
he
introduces
the
government’s
evidence,
he
rules
on
objections
of
the
claimant’s
attorney
or
the
claimant,
then
he
puts
on
his
judge
hat.
and
it's
difficult
to
determine
where
he
stops
being
the
government’s
lawyer
who
must
assimilate
all
of
this
evidence
and
becomes
the
impartial
fact
finder.
in
a
federal
tort
claim
case,
of
course,
the
judge
does
not
assimilate
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
your
honor,
all
we
are
saying
here
is
that
we
are
entitled.
if
we
are
entitled
to
make
a
claim
as
the
congress
has
held
we
are.
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
this
before
an
impartial
decision
maker
and
this
court
has
previously
held
in
immigration
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
a
man
who
garners
all
of
the
evidence
for
the
government
and
then
comes
in
and
says
now
that
i've
gathered
the
evidence,
i'm
now
going
to
hear
the
evidence
that
i've
gathered
and
decide
whether
you
should
be
deported
that
this
man
is
not
an
impartial
fact
finder.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
suit
was
a
deportation
proceeding,
this
was
the
last
point
that
i
was
going
to
cover
in
my
brief
but
it's
on
24,
it's
wong
yang
sung
versus
mcgrath
and
virtually
the
identical
procedure
was
followed
in
that
case,
as
is
followed
in
social
security
hearings
where
the
government
hearing
officer
gathers
the
evidence
for
the
government
and
then
listens
to
the
evidence
he
gathers
and
listens
to
the
immigrant
in
that
case
and
then
decides
whether
or
not
he
should
be
deported.
here,
the
hearing
examiner
gathers
the
evidence
for
the
government.
arranges
for
which
witnesses
he
will
call
and
then
he
simple
decides
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
believe
the
evidence
that
he
has
gathered
or
he
is
going
to
believe
the
evidence
that
the
claimant
puts
on.
and
the
problem
is
particularly
pointed
in
this
--
like
cases
such
as
this
where
--
and
the
evidence
is
directly
conflicting
and
much
of
the
evidence
relied
on
by
the
hearing
examiner
in
this
case
was
by
evidence
from
insurance
company
doctor.
this
man
had
insurance
company
claim
and
the
insurance
company
doctor
who
did
the
initial
examination.
although,
he
said
they
were
only
state
doctors.
dr.
munslow
as
the
evidence
will
show
in
the
reports
in
the
record
was
the
insurance
company
doctor.
dr.
munslow
was
the
doctor
he
relied
on
as
well
as
the
hearing
adviser,
the
medical
adviser
who
had
never
examined
the
man.
what
we
are
saying
basically
here
is
that
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
said
that
where
government
action
direct
or
governmental
agencies
adjudicate
or
make
binding
determinations
which
directly
affect
the
legal
rights
of
individuals.
it
is
imperative
that
those
agencies
use
the
procedures
that
have
been
traditionally
associated
with
the
judicial
process,
that
was
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
say
your
honor
when
that
it
is
basically
unfair
and
that
this
court
has
held
it
in
cases
where
there
is
direct
conflicts
on
the
crucial
issue
to
be
decided
and
it
is
an
issue
which
gives
rights
or
denies
rights
to
the
individual.
that
he
is
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
a
fair
hearing
and
this
court
has
held
that
a
fair
hearing
requires
confrontation
and
cross
examination.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
we
definitely
did.
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
mean
that
it
cannot
be
considered
by
the
decision
maker
in
rendering
a
decision.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
right,
in
fact
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
i
was
his
lawyer
at
the
hearing.
let
me
say
this
is
one
of
the
crucial
points.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
marshall.
yes
sir
in
the
workmans
compensation
proceeding
where
these
doctors
were
called
the
man
was
granted
total
permanent
benefits,
which
is
a
perfect
example.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
we
offered
one
doctor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i
consider
that
the
doctor
was
an
expert
witness
by
that
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
medicine
your
honor,
in
other
words
are
you
saying
did
i
offer
any
specialist?
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
i
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
and
it
is
our
position
in
response
to
this.
mr.
richard
tinsman
your
honor
i
would
say
this
to
you,
it
has
been
my
experience
and
i
am
a
trial
lawyer
who
is
a
plaintiff’s
lawyer
that
in
many
cases.
one
is
this
example
that
when
the
doctors
have
to
come
testifying
not
only
sometimes
it
isn’t
the
question
of
shaking
their
testimony
but
showing
their
bias
and
making
their
position
look
ridiculous.
for
example
the
medical
adviser
in
this
particular
case
dr.
levin
testified
on
the
record
that
he
would
consider
no
person
in
this
country
disabled
even
a
quadrant
amputee
if
they
were
given
proper
treatment.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
on
page
150
of
the
record.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
150
in
the
record
your
honor
and
it's
down
right
at
the
bottom,
the
reporter
has
got
quadrant
amputees
spelled
wrong
but
it's
right
at
the
bottom.
mr.
richard
tinsman
if
he
is
given
proper
care
he
says
there
is
no
person
who
is
disabled
in
the
country.
even
one
with
all
of
his
arms
and
legs
off,
i
don’t
think
this
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
no
person
could
be
disabled.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
right
but
he
had
never
examined
the
man
and
this
is
the
significant
thing,
is
he
comes
along
and
says
even
though,
i
have
never
examined
this
particular
individual,
i've
looked
at
the
doctor’s
reports
and
i
have
looked
at
the
transcript
to
dr.
morales’s
testimony
and
i
think
these
doctor’s
reports
are
wrong
and
this
doctor
is
right.
well,
we
don’t
feel
that
that
is
absolutely
necessary
in
any
event.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
it
is
but
only
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule
and
i
think
this
is
another
significant
thing
is
32%
of
the
awards
which
have
been
appealed
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule
have
been
sent
back
which
means
that
the
courts
found
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
it
is
our
opinion
--
it
was
our
judgment
at
least
that
once
we
make
our
case,
it
is
not
our
burden
to
disprove
the
government’s
case
in
effect
that’s
what
we
are
being
asked
to
do?
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
man
was
picking
up
a
bundle
of
shingles
your
honor
and
he
was
truck
driver
and
unloading
some
shingles,
he
picked
up
a
bundle
and
injured
his
back.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
he
has
not
and
in
fact
it
shows
in
the
record
only
in
his
application
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
one
year
after
this
hearing,
this
man
had
a
back
effusion
which
means
all
of
these
doctors
who
said
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
him
were
found
to
be
wrong.
and
the
general
practitioner
who
testified
that
he
was
disabled
and
there
was
something
there
even
though
he
had
no
objective
evidence
was
subsequently
proven
correct.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
other
word
the
doctor
would
not
have
done
effusion
unless
he
found
that
there
was
some
problem
in
his
back
that
requires
this
effusion.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
the
doctor
obviously
would
not
have
done
effusion
if
he
felt
the
man
did
not
need
it
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
it's
been
my
experience
at
least
in
the
trial
practice
and
i've
tried
many
back
cases
that
effusion
is
only
done
as
a
last
resort
when
you
cannot
eliminate
the
pain
by
any
other
method.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
man
has
had
less
pain
but
he
is
still
a
man
with
a
third
grade
education
and
he
is
not
been
able
to
go
back
to
work.
this
accident
happened
in
1965.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
many
people
can,
for
example,
a
lawyer
can
work
with
pain
or
an
accountant
can,
even
though
if
he
has
back
pain
can
perform
labor
but
a
laboring
man
whose
really
only
asset
is
his
back,
is
one
who
if
he
has
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
his
back
cannot
continue
to
earn
a
living.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
we’re
not
--
we’re
saying
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
man’s
back
at
the
time
that
all
of
the
specialists
said
this
was
just
of
mild
severity
and
that
he
could
go
to
work.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
is
not
in
the
record
and
we
simply
mention
it
because
these
questions
were
brought
up.
the
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
the
doctors
that
we
had
said
it
were
a
back
sprain.
now
i
have
not
gone
in
and
because
actually,
after
the
workmans
compensation
proceeding
that
was
tried
where
he
was
granted
total
disability,
i
have
not
gone
in
and
followed
the
medical
records
that
closely
because
that
would
have
to
be
reserved
for
another
hearing.
but
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
he
was
held
to
have
a
back
sprain.
his
own
doctor
said
that
the
pain
so
severe
that
he
could
not
work.
the
insurance
company
doctor
and
as
well
as
the
doctor
from
the
state
agency
said
he
had
something
wrong
with
his
back
but
they
felt
that
he
could
work
based
on
this.
mr.
richard
tinsman
his
lifting
a
bundle
of
shingles
your
honor
when
he
was
unloading
a
truck.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
an
article
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
in
the
mississippi
law
journal,
it
states
that
at
in
the
present
time,
there
are
approximately
200
examiners
in
the
united
states,
each
of
whom
here
in
average
of
eight
to
ten
cases
per
month.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
those
hearing
examiners
now
hear
these
20,000
cases
your
honor.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
we
should
make
these
hearing
examiners
independent
and
do
just
like
it’s
done
in
the
long
sherman’s
case
and
make
the
government
attorney
come
in
and
present
the
government
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
but
in
other
words,
we
don’t
see
that
they
would
need
any
more
examiners.
they
would
just
need
about
--
they
could
use
members
from
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office
but
with
only
200
examiners,
this
would
not
be
an
extensive
available
use
of
manpower.
i
mean,
if
you
say
that
a
lawyer
can
be
basically
fair
in
this
context,
you
could
say
well
the
plaintiff’s
lawyer
should
be
the
hearing
examiner.
he’s
a
lawyer;
he’s
gathered
the
evidence
for
his
claimant.
he
can
listen
to
the
government’s
evidence
but
that’s
ridiculous.
and
we
all
agree
with
that
but
it's
really
not
anymore
ridiculous
than
allowing
the
government’s
lawyer
who
has
gathered
the
government’s
evidence
to
be
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
independent
man
in
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
not
necessarily
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
the
reason
is
that
this
is
not
such
a
--
in
other
words
the
right
granted
by
the
social
security
are
not
such
a
fundamental
rights
that
you
are
required
to
have
counsel
although
hew
has
pilot
programs
around
the
country
where
they
are
providing
attorneys
for
all
social
security
claimants.
they
have
done
this
on
their
own.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
there's
been
no
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
but
there's
been
no
requirement
in
civil
cases
that
you
are
required
to
have
a
lawyer
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
pardon
sir?
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
he
does.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
he
cross
examines
the
claimant.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
i
think
if
you’ll
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
your
honor,
you
will
find
that
really
he
cross
examined
the
claimant
and
almost
took
an
adversary
attitude.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
our
position
would
be
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
as
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
this
mere
appearance
of
evil,
you
may
have
a
man
who
is
completely
fair
as
a
district
attorney
and
who
could
get
up
and
judge
exactly
the
cases
that
he
puts
on.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
would
be
here
on
the
point
of
hearsay
testimony,
yes
sir
i
would.
mr.
richard
tinsman
what
we
ask
is,
we
ask
that
there
be
an
impartial
fact
finder
which
mr.
justice
brennan
said
has
to
be
essential
in
goldberg.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
a
hearing
examiner
can
be
an
impartial
fact
finder
but
not
one
who
is
required
to
gather
all
of
the
government’s
evidence.
he
is
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
he
can
gather
other
evidence
such
as
evidence
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
this
case,
he
went
out
and
subpoenaed
in
the
evidence
of
fellow
employees,
he
brought
in
the
medical
advisor
and
this
is
all
that
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
what
we’re
asking
for
is
a
hearing
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
not
necessarily
your
honor,
he
had
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
he
went
out
and
secured
the
insurance
company,
all
of
the
records
of
the
insurance
company
doctors
as
well.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
he
had
--
he
had
some
members
of
his
staff
to
go
and
obtain
them,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
his
staff
was
acting
under
his
direction
i
assume.
actually
the
type
of
hearing,
we’re
asking
for
has
been
provided
under
the
long
sherman’s
act
for
a
number
of
years
where
there
is
an
independent
fact
finder.
the
government
lawyer
presents
evidence
or
the
insurance
company
lawyer
depending
on
whether
they’re
insured
or
not.
and
the
claimant’s
lawyer
presents
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
pardon
sir?
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
just
because
the
long
sherman’s
act
does
it
that
way
it's
constitutional
but
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
mr.
chief
justice
he
stated
in
the
opinion,
of
course
an
impartial
decision
maker
is
essential
and
then
cited
two
cases,
in
re
murchison
and
the
wong
yang
sung
versus
mcgrath.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
the
actual
decision
was
that
this
but
the
dicta
was
in
the
opinion
that
this
impartial
decision
maker
is
essential
and
cited
these
two
cases.
one
of
which
had
almost
the
identical
type
of
hearing
examiner
that
we
have
here
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
this
has
been
raised,
we
took
the
position
that
it
was.
the
fifth
circuit
took
the
position
that
it
was
not.
the
american
bar
association
has
filed
a
brief
here
saying
that
it
was.
actually,
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
but
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
case
held
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
actually
required
this
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
required
an
impartial
hearing
examiner
who
does
not
marshal
the
evidence
for
the
government.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
it
was
an
administrative
procedure
act
decision
but
there
have
been
a
number
of
--
in
other
words
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
a
impartial
decision
maker
is
something
that
is
implicit
in
a
fair
trial.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
it
makes
no
difference.
i
would
agree
with
the
american
bar
association
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
apply.
in
our
brief,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
we
took
this
position
but
the
fifth
circuit,
although
they
held
for
is
inferentially
held
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
doe
not
apply
but
both
of
these
acts
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honor
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
in
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
examiner,
the
procedure
of
the
hearing
--
in
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
examiner
of
such
a
nature
to
afford
the
parties
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
fair
hearing.
that’s
all
the
administrative
procedure
act
holds
and
the
social
security
act
basically
holds
the
same
thing
but
the
social
security
administration
has
taken
the
position
in
the
past
that
even
when
there
is
a
direct
conflict,
a
fair
hearing
does
not
require
the
right
of
confrontation
and
cross
examination
of
the
people
on
the
crucial
issue
to
be
decided.
now,
this
super
hearsay
that
they
say
should
rule
that
should
be
adapted.
they
don’t
say
whether
it
applies
to
engineers
or
architects
or
dentists
or
accountants
or
lawyers
or
any
other
professionals.
they
are
trying
to
restrict
this
hearsay
rule
that
we
don’t
have
to
apply
the
normal
rules
of
hearsay
only
to
doctors
and
they’re
trying
to
apply
this
on
the
basis
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
may
need
an
extra
five
minutes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
alright,
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
we
are
--
it
is
our
position
that
we
relying
on
the
apa.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
administrative
procedure
act
your
honor
provides
that
cross
examination
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
and
if
party
is
entitled
to
conduct
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
we
are
but
it
has
been
interpreted
because
it
says
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
it's
in
the
social
security
regulations
your
honor
which
are
in
the
record
and
it's
--
i
don’t
have
it
right
here
but
social
security
regulations
in
effect
say
that
you
are
entitled
to
it
but
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
agree
spells
it
out
clearly
--
more
clearly,
when
it
says
that
a
party
is
entitled
to
conduct
such
cross
examination
as
maybe
required
for
a
full
and
true
disclosure
of
the
facts.
it's
just
that
the
hew
has
interpreted
that
there
is
never
a
requirement
for
cross
examination
of
medical
doctors
for
a
full
and
true
disclosure
of
the
facts.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
it
doesn’t.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
it
does
not.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
in
other
words
--
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
[laughter]
well,
what
we
are
taking
the
position
is
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
administrative
procedure
act
said
this
or
not
that
due
process
requires
this
and
mr.
justice
brennan
in
goldberg
said
in
almost
every
setting
where
important
decisions
turn
on
questions
of
fact,
due
process
requires
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
adverse
witnesses.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
your
honor
what
the
government
is
saying,
when
it
comes
to
other
cases
where
the
poor
people
are
involved
really
doesn’t
rely
on
this
concept
of
inherent
rightness
of
the
doctor’s
reports.
in
cases
involving
the
revocation
of
a
pilots
license
for
example
where
a
$40,000.00
or
$50,000.00
job
maybe
at
stake.
the
faa
does
not
simply
allow
introduction
of
reports
but
they
go
ahead
and
allow
the
pilot
to
put
on
his
doctor.
the
faa
puts
on
their
doctor
and
then
the
hearing
examiner
after
evaluating
that
testimony,
not
the
reports,
goes
ahead
and
makes
a
decision.
and
so
the
government
is
seeming
to
take
the
position
when
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
and
where
poor
people
are
involved,
we
have
one
standard
and
where
there
are
few
cases
and
more
affluent
people
involved,
we
have
a
different
stand.
basically,
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
that
it
really
doesn’t
make
any
difference
that
the
doctor
is
just
going
to
get
up
and
read
his
report
and
that’s
all
there
is
to
it.
well,
as
a
member
of
the
trial
bar,
who
has
tried
a
number
of
cases,
i
will
say
to
you
that
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
real
key.
this
makes
a
tremendous
difference
as
to
whether
you
can
win
or
lose
your
case
as
to
whether
you
can
cross
examine
the
doctors
who
are
relied
upon
by
the
government.
many
doctors,
for
example,
we
see
everyday
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
because
it's
our
position,
first
the
practical
matter.
you
recall
the
government
doctors
get
paid
a
$125.00,
if
we
subpoena
them
they
get
paid
the
witness
fee
of
$20.00.
in
our
area,
it
is
unethical
with
agreement
with
the
medical
associations
to
subpoena
a
doctor
without
paying
him
his
reasonable
fee
as
set
up
between
the
bar.
mr.
richard
tinsman
they
pay
him
the
$20.00
witness
fee
your
honor
and
nothing
more.
not
any
stipend
like
they
pay
their
own
doctor
and
so
what
we
are
faced
with
if
we
have
to
call
their
doctors,
is
we
have
to
pay
his
fee
for
coming
and
attempting
to
disprove
the
government’s
case
which
is
a
practical
matter.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
they
do.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
he
has.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
i
think
what
you’re
basically
saying
if
you
take
that
position
mr.
justice
white
is
that
we
are
not
only
having
to
prove
our
case
but
then
once
the
government
simply
puts
in
a
report,
we
have
to
go
forward
and
disprove
the
government’s
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
we
--
in
other
words
we
would
always
say
we
want
you
to
bring
the
doctor
here
and
you
pay
them,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
because
we
are
found
--
mr.
justice
white
it's
been
my
experience
that
we
have
found
that
many
of
these
doctors
in
their
reports
will
say
this
man
has
a
20%
disability
which
means
of
course,
he
doesn’t
have
a
total
disability
but
this
same
doctor
will
testify
when
he
comes
to
a
hearing
that
the
only
way
he
will
give
a
man
a
100%
disability,
if
he
is
paralyzed
from
the
neck
down.
and
unless
he
is
bedridden
he
gives
--
it
doesn’t
give
people
a
100%
disability
and
the
further
thing
that
is
shown
here
in
this
very
case
where
in
the
workmans
compensation
proceedings,
the
doctors
had
to
be
called
and
had
to
testify,
that
fact
finder
found
that
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
mr.
richard
tinsman
he
does
not
do
anything
sir.
i
think
if
really
--
if
the
government
really
believed
that
these
doctors
reports
were
so
inherently
--
such
inherent
probative
value,
why
wouldn’t
they
just
simply
take
the
claimants
doctor’s
report
and
dispense
with
all
these
independent
doctors.
mr.
richard
tinsman
his
own
physician
indicated
that
there
was
an
emotional
overlay
and
this
together
that
these
two
factors
that
prior
to
the
injury
he
was
able
to
go
out
and
earn
a
living
even
with
the
pre-existing
emotional
overlay.
but
with
the
back
condition
that
he
had
and
emotional
overlay
that
he
had
partly
brought
about
on
by
his
destitute
circumstances.
in
social
security
cases,
you
cannot
even
apply
until
you
have
been
unemployed
for
six
months.
and
in
this
case,
the
hearing
wasn’t
held
until
he
had
been
out
of
work
for
over
a
year-and-a-half.
so,
generally
these
people
are
pretty
destitute
by
the
time,
they
get
to
a
hearing
examiner
and
anyone
who’s
been
out
for
a
year
and
a
half
is
going
to
have
some
emotional
overlay.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
but
in
effect
what
your
saying
is
allow
the
medical
adviser
to
be
the
hearing
officer
as
to
medical
disability,
is
that
correct?
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i
would
say
this
mr.
chief
justice
that
unless
at
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer
that
you
allowed
the
man
to
have
the
cross
examination
of
the
doctors
who
opposed
the
contention
of
his
doctor
that
this
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
if
you
allowed
a
doctor
to
be
a
hearing
examiner
that
would
be
fine.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
it
depends
on
how
--
i
don’t
agree
that
just
the
file
should
be
referred
to
them
your
honor.
maybe
the
testimony
as
taken
down
and
if
you
make
them
the
final
arbitrar
on
all
medical
questions.
this
would
be
--
in
other
words
you
would
be
making
them
the
independent
fact
finder
and
this
would
be
constitutionally
permissible.
but
one
of
the
problems
is
who
do
you
accept
as
a
doctor?
the
state
agencies
many
times
select
doctors
who
because
they
are
attempting
to
hold
down
the
cost
of
their
own
disability
programs
are
generally
very
conservative
and
are
hesitant
to
find
disability
in
a
man
particularly
where
it
means
that
money
will
be
paid
out
of
the
public
treasury.
and
this
is
the
type
of
doctor
generally
that
is
selected
by
the
state
agencies
and
example
is
dr.
levitt
here
who
would
find
no
one
disabled
unless
they
were
--
even
if
they
had
both
arms
and
both
legs
off.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
he
didn’t
quite
put
it
that
way
but
i
think
it
indicates
his
thinking.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
man
has
been
seen
by
dr.
munslow
who
was
a
doctor
of
the
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
as
i
recall
there
were
four
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
and
then
there
was
an
additional
one
we
submitted
to
the
appeals
counsel,
so
five.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
other
words,
i
would
say
that
the
government
has
to
have
at
least
one
doctor.
specialist
or
non
specialist.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
have
some
substantial
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
it
depends
on
what
the
other
four
found,
if
the
other
four
were
finding
subjective
things
such
as
non
cooperation
and
things
of
that.
i
would
object
to
that.
if
they
were
simply
referring
to
actual
positive
tests
like
a
reading
of
an
x-ray
or
reading
of
a
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
i
would
object
to
them
referring
to
another
doctor’s
diagnosis,
i
would
say
you
have
to
testify
from
what
you
found
just
as
in
this
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
i
would
not.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
i
would
not.
i
would
insist
on
only
one
being
present
and
if
the
government
had
one
present
and
he
testified,
then
this
would
be
for
the
hearing
examiner
to
evaluate.
not
all
five
present
and
i
would
say
this.
there
was
one
specialist
who
we
found
out
later
because
normally
reports
to
the
state
welfare
agency
are
not
open
to
the
claimant.
we
found
that
a
specialist
in
the
same
office
as
of
dr.
langston
who
was
relied
on
by
the
government
who
is
a
partner
of
his
had
found
does
man
did
have
a
post
operative
herniated
disc
but
we
couldn’t
find
that
out
until
later
because
this
report
was
not
made
available
to
us.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
practical
situation
is
not
there
your
honor
because
number
one;
they
don’t
have
the
subpoena
that
you
request
and
secondly
even
if
they
do
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
right
because
we
take
the
position
that
what
in
effect
then
you
are
requiring
us
to
do
is
not
only
prove
our
case
but
we
have
to
come
in
--
if
we
put
the
witnesses
on
and
disprove
the
government’s
case
and
what
if
these
witnesses
testify
adversely?
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
they
had
a
second
hearing
your
honor
in
this
case,
the
government
did
not
choose
to
call
their
doctors
and
the
second
hearing
that
brought
in
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
from
the
reports
they
certainly
wouldn’t
have
helped
us
and
so
it
was
our
position
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
if
i
was
calling
him
directly.
mr.
richard
tinsman
but
if
i
had
to
have
a
choice
between
the
report
being
relied
on
by
the
hearing
examiner
or
the
doctor’s
personal
testimony
being
relied
on
by
the
hearing
examiner,
even
though
i
knew
both
were
adverse
to
me,
i
would
rather
ask
the
doctors
there.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
it
was
a
decision
that
we
made
that
we
felt
that
if
we
had
asked
the
doctor
to
be
there
in
effect
number
one;
we
would
be
vouching
for
the
doctor,
number
two
we
would
have
had
to
pay
for
the
doctor
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
but
i
have
to
continue
to
practice
law
in
that
community
and
if
you
do
this
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
going
to
be
some
doctors
that
will
always
give
your
clients
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
we’re
not
building
--
in
other
words
what
we’re
saying
is
that
we
just
don’t
have
this
obligation
to
an
effect
disprove
the
government’s
reports.
in
effect,
this
would
mean
that
in
any
administrative
hearing
if
the
government
put
on
the
report
of
a
lawyer
or
an
engineer
or
anything
else
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
let
me
say
this
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
white,
they
don’t
tell
you
that.
they
say
the
reports
were
going
to
rely
on
can
be
examined
you
on
the
morning
of
the
hearing
or
in
the
examiners
office
and
he
is
in
houston
and
it's
not
feasible
to
go
200
miles
to
look
at
the
reports
that
happen
to
be
in
his
office,
we
have
written
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
oh
we
knew
that
we
had
the
right
to
subpoena
the
doctor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
did
not
know
all
of
the
reports
that
he
had
in
his
file,
some
of
the
reports
your
honor,
in
fact
all
social
security
reports
that
are
made
are
not
released
to
the
claimant.
it's
against
social
security
--
we
have
attempted
to
get
them
in
other
cases
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
social
security
administrations
has
come
in
and
said
this
are
not
to
be
released
to
the
claimant
the
man
that
was
examined.
because
under
the
federal
regulations
they’re
absolutely
privileged
so
the
only
time
you
can
see
them
is
when
the
hearing
examiner's
file
is
open
to
you
which
means
either
going
to
houston
to
look
at
them
or
on
the
morning
of
the
hearing.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
that
would
satisfy
me.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
it's
our
position
that
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
no,
no
that’s
our
point
on
the
medical
advisor.
our
point
is
that
the
government’s
evidence
as
to
no
disability
was
only
reports.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
would
object
to
that,
i
would
say
his
opinion
could
be
only
on
his
examination
of
the
man.
in
other
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
that’s
another
matter.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
think,
he
can
read
the
reports
but
he
must
form
his
own
independent
evaluation.
in
other
words
he
can
say,
i
read
this
reports
and
i
disagree
with
them.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
that
would
satisfy
me.
mr.
richard
tinsman
what
we
want
is
a
man
that’s
examined
him
to
testify
in
the
hearing,
yes
sir
and
our
position
on
this
medical
advisor
thing
is
if
they
really
believe
in
these
doctors
whose
reports
they
say
are
inherently
right,
why
don’t
they
just
bring
one
of
those
doctors
to
be
the
medical
advisor
rather
than
bringing
in
a
man
who
has
never
examined
the
man.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
claimant
has
the
burden
of
proof
your
honor
and
he
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
when
we
bring
our
doctor
who
testifies
that
this
man
is
totally
disabled,
your
honor
we
feel
that
we
have
met
our
burden
of
proof
and
then
the
burden
of
--
if
the
government
wishes
to
contest
this,
then
they
must
come
in
with
proof
that
says
no,
your
doctor
is
wrong,
he
is
not
disabled.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
if
we
really
feel
that
what
mr.
justice
brennan
said
in
goldberg
is
that
in
almost
every
setting
where
important
decisions
turn
on
questions
of
fact
due
process
requires
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
adverse
witnesses
that
this
would
be
highly
suspect
as
a
violation
of
due
process.
that
congress
cannot
provide
this.
now
the
court
said
that
almost
every
situation
is
for
this
court
to
determine
which
are
the
exemptions.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
tinsman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
issue
to
be
decided
here
is
this
limited
one,
where
each
side
has
directly
contrary
evidence
on
the
crucial
issue
to
be
decided
in
this
particular
case.
disability
of
the
claimant
and
it's
directly
in
conflict
what
procedure
should
be
involved?
the
one
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
mandated
where
the
government
must
bring
in
their
doctors,
their
evidence
or
the
one
that
has
been
followed
in
the
past.
now
mr.
justice
brennan
indicated
this
is
not
an
adversary
procedure.
this
is
the
position
that
has
been
taken
by
the
government
but
of
it's
very
nature
this
is
an
adversary
procedure
because
the
government
on
one
hand
has
reports
that
say
this
man
is
not
disabled.
the
man
says
those
reports
are
wrong,
i
am
disabled
and
my
doctor
says
i
am
disabled,
so
we
really
can't
characterize
this
as
not
an
adversary
proceeding
of
its
very
nature.
it
must
be,
because
it
is
a
disability
hearing
where
there
are
two
doctors,
who
are
directly
in
conflict.
and
the
problem
in
social
security
hearings
is
there
must
be
total
and
complete
disability.
not
as
in
some
programs
as
in
veterans
programs
where
there
might
be
partial
disability.
now,
we
start
out
with
a
basic
proposition
that
has
been
enunciated
by
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
that
say
they’re
all
cited
by
the
fifth
circuit.
one
of
them
is
consolidated
edison
versus
to
national
labor
relations
board
that
says
uncorroborated
hearsay
does
not
constitute
substantial
evidence.
and
then
this
court
has
in
many
cases
brought
forward
the
proposition
that
the
right
of
confrontation
and
cross
examination
even
in
administrative
hearings
is
a
basic
right
that
a
person
has.
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
actually
have
three
points
that
i’d
like
to
bring
out
mr.
justice
black.
first
is
that
--
and
the
most
primary
one
which
as
the
fifth
circuit
decided
on
is
that
these
hearsay
reports
are
not
substantial
evidence
and
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
so.
the
second
point
that
we
will
make
in
the
argument
is
this
medical
adviser
situation
where
the
man
has
never
examined
the
man
is
improper.
and
the
third
point
that
we
will
make
and
have
made
in
our
brief
is
that
the
whole
procedure
that
is
presently
followed
by
social
security
violates
due
process
and
that
the
hearing
examiner
is
both
the
government’s
attorney
and
then
he
becomes
the
judge
and
he
is
not
an
impartial
fact
finder
as
has
been
required
by
the
court
in
past
situations.
i
would
like
to
first
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
because,
generally
in
the
suits
where
the
government
consented
to
be
sued,
we
have
an
impartial
fact
finder
and
that’s
the
federal
district
judge.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
your
honor
in
the
suits
of
federal
court
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
but
the
hearing
examiner
must
be
the
government’s
lawyer
as
well
as
the
judge.
he
first
puts
on
the
government
lawyer
hat
and
then
after
he
introduces
the
government’s
evidence,
he
rules
on
objections
of
the
claimant’s
attorney
or
the
claimant,
then
he
puts
on
his
judge
hat.
and
it's
difficult
to
determine
where
he
stops
being
the
government’s
lawyer
who
must
assimilate
all
of
this
evidence
and
becomes
the
impartial
fact
finder.
in
a
federal
tort
claim
case,
of
course,
the
judge
does
not
assimilate
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
your
honor,
all
we
are
saying
here
is
that
we
are
entitled.
if
we
are
entitled
to
make
a
claim
as
the
congress
has
held
we
are.
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
this
before
an
impartial
decision
maker
and
this
court
has
previously
held
in
immigration
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
a
man
who
garners
all
of
the
evidence
for
the
government
and
then
comes
in
and
says
now
that
i've
gathered
the
evidence,
i'm
now
going
to
hear
the
evidence
that
i've
gathered
and
decide
whether
you
should
be
deported
that
this
man
is
not
an
impartial
fact
finder.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
suit
was
a
deportation
proceeding,
this
was
the
last
point
that
i
was
going
to
cover
in
my
brief
but
it's
on
24,
it's
wong
yang
sung
versus
mcgrath
and
virtually
the
identical
procedure
was
followed
in
that
case,
as
is
followed
in
social
security
hearings
where
the
government
hearing
officer
gathers
the
evidence
for
the
government
and
then
listens
to
the
evidence
he
gathers
and
listens
to
the
immigrant
in
that
case
and
then
decides
whether
or
not
he
should
be
deported.
here,
the
hearing
examiner
gathers
the
evidence
for
the
government.
arranges
for
which
witnesses
he
will
call
and
then
he
simple
decides
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
believe
the
evidence
that
he
has
gathered
or
he
is
going
to
believe
the
evidence
that
the
claimant
puts
on.
and
the
problem
is
particularly
pointed
in
this
--
like
cases
such
as
this
where
--
and
the
evidence
is
directly
conflicting
and
much
of
the
evidence
relied
on
by
the
hearing
examiner
in
this
case
was
by
evidence
from
insurance
company
doctor.
this
man
had
insurance
company
claim
and
the
insurance
company
doctor
who
did
the
initial
examination.
although,
he
said
they
were
only
state
doctors.
dr.
munslow
as
the
evidence
will
show
in
the
reports
in
the
record
was
the
insurance
company
doctor.
dr.
munslow
was
the
doctor
he
relied
on
as
well
as
the
hearing
adviser,
the
medical
adviser
who
had
never
examined
the
man.
what
we
are
saying
basically
here
is
that
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
said
that
where
government
action
direct
or
governmental
agencies
adjudicate
or
make
binding
determinations
which
directly
affect
the
legal
rights
of
individuals.
it
is
imperative
that
those
agencies
use
the
procedures
that
have
been
traditionally
associated
with
the
judicial
process,
that
was
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
say
your
honor
when
that
it
is
basically
unfair
and
that
this
court
has
held
it
in
cases
where
there
is
direct
conflicts
on
the
crucial
issue
to
be
decided
and
it
is
an
issue
which
gives
rights
or
denies
rights
to
the
individual.
that
he
is
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
a
fair
hearing
and
this
court
has
held
that
a
fair
hearing
requires
confrontation
and
cross
examination.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
we
definitely
did.
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
mean
that
it
cannot
be
considered
by
the
decision
maker
in
rendering
a
decision.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
right,
in
fact
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
i
was
his
lawyer
at
the
hearing.
let
me
say
this
is
one
of
the
crucial
points.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
marshall.
yes
sir
in
the
workmans
compensation
proceeding
where
these
doctors
were
called
the
man
was
granted
total
permanent
benefits,
which
is
a
perfect
example.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
we
offered
one
doctor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i
consider
that
the
doctor
was
an
expert
witness
by
that
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
medicine
your
honor,
in
other
words
are
you
saying
did
i
offer
any
specialist?
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
i
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
and
it
is
our
position
in
response
to
this.
mr.
richard
tinsman
your
honor
i
would
say
this
to
you,
it
has
been
my
experience
and
i
am
a
trial
lawyer
who
is
a
plaintiff’s
lawyer
that
in
many
cases.
one
is
this
example
that
when
the
doctors
have
to
come
testifying
not
only
sometimes
it
isn’t
the
question
of
shaking
their
testimony
but
showing
their
bias
and
making
their
position
look
ridiculous.
for
example
the
medical
adviser
in
this
particular
case
dr.
levin
testified
on
the
record
that
he
would
consider
no
person
in
this
country
disabled
even
a
quadrant
amputee
if
they
were
given
proper
treatment.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
on
page
150
of
the
record.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
150
in
the
record
your
honor
and
it's
down
right
at
the
bottom,
the
reporter
has
got
quadrant
amputees
spelled
wrong
but
it's
right
at
the
bottom.
mr.
richard
tinsman
if
he
is
given
proper
care
he
says
there
is
no
person
who
is
disabled
in
the
country.
even
one
with
all
of
his
arms
and
legs
off,
i
don’t
think
this
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
no
person
could
be
disabled.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
right
but
he
had
never
examined
the
man
and
this
is
the
significant
thing,
is
he
comes
along
and
says
even
though,
i
have
never
examined
this
particular
individual,
i've
looked
at
the
doctor’s
reports
and
i
have
looked
at
the
transcript
to
dr.
morales’s
testimony
and
i
think
these
doctor’s
reports
are
wrong
and
this
doctor
is
right.
well,
we
don’t
feel
that
that
is
absolutely
necessary
in
any
event.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
it
is
but
only
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule
and
i
think
this
is
another
significant
thing
is
32%
of
the
awards
which
have
been
appealed
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule
have
been
sent
back
which
means
that
the
courts
found
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
it
is
our
opinion
--
it
was
our
judgment
at
least
that
once
we
make
our
case,
it
is
not
our
burden
to
disprove
the
government’s
case
in
effect
that’s
what
we
are
being
asked
to
do?
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
man
was
picking
up
a
bundle
of
shingles
your
honor
and
he
was
truck
driver
and
unloading
some
shingles,
he
picked
up
a
bundle
and
injured
his
back.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
he
has
not
and
in
fact
it
shows
in
the
record
only
in
his
application
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
one
year
after
this
hearing,
this
man
had
a
back
effusion
which
means
all
of
these
doctors
who
said
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
him
were
found
to
be
wrong.
and
the
general
practitioner
who
testified
that
he
was
disabled
and
there
was
something
there
even
though
he
had
no
objective
evidence
was
subsequently
proven
correct.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
other
word
the
doctor
would
not
have
done
effusion
unless
he
found
that
there
was
some
problem
in
his
back
that
requires
this
effusion.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
the
doctor
obviously
would
not
have
done
effusion
if
he
felt
the
man
did
not
need
it
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
it's
been
my
experience
at
least
in
the
trial
practice
and
i've
tried
many
back
cases
that
effusion
is
only
done
as
a
last
resort
when
you
cannot
eliminate
the
pain
by
any
other
method.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
man
has
had
less
pain
but
he
is
still
a
man
with
a
third
grade
education
and
he
is
not
been
able
to
go
back
to
work.
this
accident
happened
in
1965.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
many
people
can,
for
example,
a
lawyer
can
work
with
pain
or
an
accountant
can,
even
though
if
he
has
back
pain
can
perform
labor
but
a
laboring
man
whose
really
only
asset
is
his
back,
is
one
who
if
he
has
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
his
back
cannot
continue
to
earn
a
living.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
we’re
not
--
we’re
saying
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
man’s
back
at
the
time
that
all
of
the
specialists
said
this
was
just
of
mild
severity
and
that
he
could
go
to
work.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
is
not
in
the
record
and
we
simply
mention
it
because
these
questions
were
brought
up.
the
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
the
doctors
that
we
had
said
it
were
a
back
sprain.
now
i
have
not
gone
in
and
because
actually,
after
the
workmans
compensation
proceeding
that
was
tried
where
he
was
granted
total
disability,
i
have
not
gone
in
and
followed
the
medical
records
that
closely
because
that
would
have
to
be
reserved
for
another
hearing.
but
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
he
was
held
to
have
a
back
sprain.
his
own
doctor
said
that
the
pain
so
severe
that
he
could
not
work.
the
insurance
company
doctor
and
as
well
as
the
doctor
from
the
state
agency
said
he
had
something
wrong
with
his
back
but
they
felt
that
he
could
work
based
on
this.
mr.
richard
tinsman
his
lifting
a
bundle
of
shingles
your
honor
when
he
was
unloading
a
truck.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
an
article
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
in
the
mississippi
law
journal,
it
states
that
at
in
the
present
time,
there
are
approximately
200
examiners
in
the
united
states,
each
of
whom
here
in
average
of
eight
to
ten
cases
per
month.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
those
hearing
examiners
now
hear
these
20,000
cases
your
honor.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
we
should
make
these
hearing
examiners
independent
and
do
just
like
it’s
done
in
the
long
sherman’s
case
and
make
the
government
attorney
come
in
and
present
the
government
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
but
in
other
words,
we
don’t
see
that
they
would
need
any
more
examiners.
they
would
just
need
about
--
they
could
use
members
from
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office
but
with
only
200
examiners,
this
would
not
be
an
extensive
available
use
of
manpower.
i
mean,
if
you
say
that
a
lawyer
can
be
basically
fair
in
this
context,
you
could
say
well
the
plaintiff’s
lawyer
should
be
the
hearing
examiner.
he’s
a
lawyer;
he’s
gathered
the
evidence
for
his
claimant.
he
can
listen
to
the
government’s
evidence
but
that’s
ridiculous.
and
we
all
agree
with
that
but
it's
really
not
anymore
ridiculous
than
allowing
the
government’s
lawyer
who
has
gathered
the
government’s
evidence
to
be
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
independent
man
in
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
not
necessarily
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
the
reason
is
that
this
is
not
such
a
--
in
other
words
the
right
granted
by
the
social
security
are
not
such
a
fundamental
rights
that
you
are
required
to
have
counsel
although
hew
has
pilot
programs
around
the
country
where
they
are
providing
attorneys
for
all
social
security
claimants.
they
have
done
this
on
their
own.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
there's
been
no
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
but
there's
been
no
requirement
in
civil
cases
that
you
are
required
to
have
a
lawyer
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
pardon
sir?
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
he
does.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
he
cross
examines
the
claimant.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
i
think
if
you’ll
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
your
honor,
you
will
find
that
really
he
cross
examined
the
claimant
and
almost
took
an
adversary
attitude.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
our
position
would
be
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
as
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
this
mere
appearance
of
evil,
you
may
have
a
man
who
is
completely
fair
as
a
district
attorney
and
who
could
get
up
and
judge
exactly
the
cases
that
he
puts
on.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
would
be
here
on
the
point
of
hearsay
testimony,
yes
sir
i
would.
mr.
richard
tinsman
what
we
ask
is,
we
ask
that
there
be
an
impartial
fact
finder
which
mr.
justice
brennan
said
has
to
be
essential
in
goldberg.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
a
hearing
examiner
can
be
an
impartial
fact
finder
but
not
one
who
is
required
to
gather
all
of
the
government’s
evidence.
he
is
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
he
can
gather
other
evidence
such
as
evidence
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
this
case,
he
went
out
and
subpoenaed
in
the
evidence
of
fellow
employees,
he
brought
in
the
medical
advisor
and
this
is
all
that
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
what
we’re
asking
for
is
a
hearing
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
not
necessarily
your
honor,
he
had
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
he
went
out
and
secured
the
insurance
company,
all
of
the
records
of
the
insurance
company
doctors
as
well.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
he
had
--
he
had
some
members
of
his
staff
to
go
and
obtain
them,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
his
staff
was
acting
under
his
direction
i
assume.
actually
the
type
of
hearing,
we’re
asking
for
has
been
provided
under
the
long
sherman’s
act
for
a
number
of
years
where
there
is
an
independent
fact
finder.
the
government
lawyer
presents
evidence
or
the
insurance
company
lawyer
depending
on
whether
they’re
insured
or
not.
and
the
claimant’s
lawyer
presents
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
pardon
sir?
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
just
because
the
long
sherman’s
act
does
it
that
way
it's
constitutional
but
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
mr.
chief
justice
he
stated
in
the
opinion,
of
course
an
impartial
decision
maker
is
essential
and
then
cited
two
cases,
in
re
murchison
and
the
wong
yang
sung
versus
mcgrath.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
the
actual
decision
was
that
this
but
the
dicta
was
in
the
opinion
that
this
impartial
decision
maker
is
essential
and
cited
these
two
cases.
one
of
which
had
almost
the
identical
type
of
hearing
examiner
that
we
have
here
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
this
has
been
raised,
we
took
the
position
that
it
was.
the
fifth
circuit
took
the
position
that
it
was
not.
the
american
bar
association
has
filed
a
brief
here
saying
that
it
was.
actually,
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
but
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
case
held
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
actually
required
this
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
required
an
impartial
hearing
examiner
who
does
not
marshal
the
evidence
for
the
government.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
it
was
an
administrative
procedure
act
decision
but
there
have
been
a
number
of
--
in
other
words
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
a
impartial
decision
maker
is
something
that
is
implicit
in
a
fair
trial.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
it
makes
no
difference.
i
would
agree
with
the
american
bar
association
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
apply.
in
our
brief,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
we
took
this
position
but
the
fifth
circuit,
although
they
held
for
is
inferentially
held
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
doe
not
apply
but
both
of
these
acts
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honor
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
in
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
examiner,
the
procedure
of
the
hearing
--
in
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
examiner
of
such
a
nature
to
afford
the
parties
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
fair
hearing.
that’s
all
the
administrative
procedure
act
holds
and
the
social
security
act
basically
holds
the
same
thing
but
the
social
security
administration
has
taken
the
position
in
the
past
that
even
when
there
is
a
direct
conflict,
a
fair
hearing
does
not
require
the
right
of
confrontation
and
cross
examination
of
the
people
on
the
crucial
issue
to
be
decided.
now,
this
super
hearsay
that
they
say
should
rule
that
should
be
adapted.
they
don’t
say
whether
it
applies
to
engineers
or
architects
or
dentists
or
accountants
or
lawyers
or
any
other
professionals.
they
are
trying
to
restrict
this
hearsay
rule
that
we
don’t
have
to
apply
the
normal
rules
of
hearsay
only
to
doctors
and
they’re
trying
to
apply
this
on
the
basis
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
may
need
an
extra
five
minutes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
alright,
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
we
are
--
it
is
our
position
that
we
relying
on
the
apa.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
administrative
procedure
act
your
honor
provides
that
cross
examination
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
and
if
party
is
entitled
to
conduct
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
we
are
but
it
has
been
interpreted
because
it
says
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
it's
in
the
social
security
regulations
your
honor
which
are
in
the
record
and
it's
--
i
don’t
have
it
right
here
but
social
security
regulations
in
effect
say
that
you
are
entitled
to
it
but
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
agree
spells
it
out
clearly
--
more
clearly,
when
it
says
that
a
party
is
entitled
to
conduct
such
cross
examination
as
maybe
required
for
a
full
and
true
disclosure
of
the
facts.
it's
just
that
the
hew
has
interpreted
that
there
is
never
a
requirement
for
cross
examination
of
medical
doctors
for
a
full
and
true
disclosure
of
the
facts.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
it
doesn’t.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
it
does
not.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
in
other
words
--
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
[laughter]
well,
what
we
are
taking
the
position
is
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
administrative
procedure
act
said
this
or
not
that
due
process
requires
this
and
mr.
justice
brennan
in
goldberg
said
in
almost
every
setting
where
important
decisions
turn
on
questions
of
fact,
due
process
requires
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
adverse
witnesses.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
your
honor
what
the
government
is
saying,
when
it
comes
to
other
cases
where
the
poor
people
are
involved
really
doesn’t
rely
on
this
concept
of
inherent
rightness
of
the
doctor’s
reports.
in
cases
involving
the
revocation
of
a
pilots
license
for
example
where
a
$40,000.00
or
$50,000.00
job
maybe
at
stake.
the
faa
does
not
simply
allow
introduction
of
reports
but
they
go
ahead
and
allow
the
pilot
to
put
on
his
doctor.
the
faa
puts
on
their
doctor
and
then
the
hearing
examiner
after
evaluating
that
testimony,
not
the
reports,
goes
ahead
and
makes
a
decision.
and
so
the
government
is
seeming
to
take
the
position
when
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
and
where
poor
people
are
involved,
we
have
one
standard
and
where
there
are
few
cases
and
more
affluent
people
involved,
we
have
a
different
stand.
basically,
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
that
it
really
doesn’t
make
any
difference
that
the
doctor
is
just
going
to
get
up
and
read
his
report
and
that’s
all
there
is
to
it.
well,
as
a
member
of
the
trial
bar,
who
has
tried
a
number
of
cases,
i
will
say
to
you
that
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
real
key.
this
makes
a
tremendous
difference
as
to
whether
you
can
win
or
lose
your
case
as
to
whether
you
can
cross
examine
the
doctors
who
are
relied
upon
by
the
government.
many
doctors,
for
example,
we
see
everyday
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
because
it's
our
position,
first
the
practical
matter.
you
recall
the
government
doctors
get
paid
a
$125.00,
if
we
subpoena
them
they
get
paid
the
witness
fee
of
$20.00.
in
our
area,
it
is
unethical
with
agreement
with
the
medical
associations
to
subpoena
a
doctor
without
paying
him
his
reasonable
fee
as
set
up
between
the
bar.
mr.
richard
tinsman
they
pay
him
the
$20.00
witness
fee
your
honor
and
nothing
more.
not
any
stipend
like
they
pay
their
own
doctor
and
so
what
we
are
faced
with
if
we
have
to
call
their
doctors,
is
we
have
to
pay
his
fee
for
coming
and
attempting
to
disprove
the
government’s
case
which
is
a
practical
matter.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
they
do.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
he
has.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
i
think
what
you’re
basically
saying
if
you
take
that
position
mr.
justice
white
is
that
we
are
not
only
having
to
prove
our
case
but
then
once
the
government
simply
puts
in
a
report,
we
have
to
go
forward
and
disprove
the
government’s
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
we
--
in
other
words
we
would
always
say
we
want
you
to
bring
the
doctor
here
and
you
pay
them,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
because
we
are
found
--
mr.
justice
white
it's
been
my
experience
that
we
have
found
that
many
of
these
doctors
in
their
reports
will
say
this
man
has
a
20%
disability
which
means
of
course,
he
doesn’t
have
a
total
disability
but
this
same
doctor
will
testify
when
he
comes
to
a
hearing
that
the
only
way
he
will
give
a
man
a
100%
disability,
if
he
is
paralyzed
from
the
neck
down.
and
unless
he
is
bedridden
he
gives
--
it
doesn’t
give
people
a
100%
disability
and
the
further
thing
that
is
shown
here
in
this
very
case
where
in
the
workmans
compensation
proceedings,
the
doctors
had
to
be
called
and
had
to
testify,
that
fact
finder
found
that
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
mr.
richard
tinsman
he
does
not
do
anything
sir.
i
think
if
really
--
if
the
government
really
believed
that
these
doctors
reports
were
so
inherently
--
such
inherent
probative
value,
why
wouldn’t
they
just
simply
take
the
claimants
doctor’s
report
and
dispense
with
all
these
independent
doctors.
mr.
richard
tinsman
his
own
physician
indicated
that
there
was
an
emotional
overlay
and
this
together
that
these
two
factors
that
prior
to
the
injury
he
was
able
to
go
out
and
earn
a
living
even
with
the
pre-existing
emotional
overlay.
but
with
the
back
condition
that
he
had
and
emotional
overlay
that
he
had
partly
brought
about
on
by
his
destitute
circumstances.
in
social
security
cases,
you
cannot
even
apply
until
you
have
been
unemployed
for
six
months.
and
in
this
case,
the
hearing
wasn’t
held
until
he
had
been
out
of
work
for
over
a
year-and-a-half.
so,
generally
these
people
are
pretty
destitute
by
the
time,
they
get
to
a
hearing
examiner
and
anyone
who’s
been
out
for
a
year
and
a
half
is
going
to
have
some
emotional
overlay.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
but
in
effect
what
your
saying
is
allow
the
medical
adviser
to
be
the
hearing
officer
as
to
medical
disability,
is
that
correct?
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i
would
say
this
mr.
chief
justice
that
unless
at
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer
that
you
allowed
the
man
to
have
the
cross
examination
of
the
doctors
who
opposed
the
contention
of
his
doctor
that
this
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
if
you
allowed
a
doctor
to
be
a
hearing
examiner
that
would
be
fine.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
it
depends
on
how
--
i
don’t
agree
that
just
the
file
should
be
referred
to
them
your
honor.
maybe
the
testimony
as
taken
down
and
if
you
make
them
the
final
arbitrar
on
all
medical
questions.
this
would
be
--
in
other
words
you
would
be
making
them
the
independent
fact
finder
and
this
would
be
constitutionally
permissible.
but
one
of
the
problems
is
who
do
you
accept
as
a
doctor?
the
state
agencies
many
times
select
doctors
who
because
they
are
attempting
to
hold
down
the
cost
of
their
own
disability
programs
are
generally
very
conservative
and
are
hesitant
to
find
disability
in
a
man
particularly
where
it
means
that
money
will
be
paid
out
of
the
public
treasury.
and
this
is
the
type
of
doctor
generally
that
is
selected
by
the
state
agencies
and
example
is
dr.
levitt
here
who
would
find
no
one
disabled
unless
they
were
--
even
if
they
had
both
arms
and
both
legs
off.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
he
didn’t
quite
put
it
that
way
but
i
think
it
indicates
his
thinking.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
man
has
been
seen
by
dr.
munslow
who
was
a
doctor
of
the
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
as
i
recall
there
were
four
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
and
then
there
was
an
additional
one
we
submitted
to
the
appeals
counsel,
so
five.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
other
words,
i
would
say
that
the
government
has
to
have
at
least
one
doctor.
specialist
or
non
specialist.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
have
some
substantial
evidence.
mr.
richard
tinsman
it
depends
on
what
the
other
four
found,
if
the
other
four
were
finding
subjective
things
such
as
non
cooperation
and
things
of
that.
i
would
object
to
that.
if
they
were
simply
referring
to
actual
positive
tests
like
a
reading
of
an
x-ray
or
reading
of
a
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
i
would
object
to
them
referring
to
another
doctor’s
diagnosis,
i
would
say
you
have
to
testify
from
what
you
found
just
as
in
this
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir
i
would
not.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
i
would
not.
i
would
insist
on
only
one
being
present
and
if
the
government
had
one
present
and
he
testified,
then
this
would
be
for
the
hearing
examiner
to
evaluate.
not
all
five
present
and
i
would
say
this.
there
was
one
specialist
who
we
found
out
later
because
normally
reports
to
the
state
welfare
agency
are
not
open
to
the
claimant.
we
found
that
a
specialist
in
the
same
office
as
of
dr.
langston
who
was
relied
on
by
the
government
who
is
a
partner
of
his
had
found
does
man
did
have
a
post
operative
herniated
disc
but
we
couldn’t
find
that
out
until
later
because
this
report
was
not
made
available
to
us.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
practical
situation
is
not
there
your
honor
because
number
one;
they
don’t
have
the
subpoena
that
you
request
and
secondly
even
if
they
do
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that’s
right
because
we
take
the
position
that
what
in
effect
then
you
are
requiring
us
to
do
is
not
only
prove
our
case
but
we
have
to
come
in
--
if
we
put
the
witnesses
on
and
disprove
the
government’s
case
and
what
if
these
witnesses
testify
adversely?
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
they
had
a
second
hearing
your
honor
in
this
case,
the
government
did
not
choose
to
call
their
doctors
and
the
second
hearing
that
brought
in
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
from
the
reports
they
certainly
wouldn’t
have
helped
us
and
so
it
was
our
position
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
if
i
was
calling
him
directly.
mr.
richard
tinsman
but
if
i
had
to
have
a
choice
between
the
report
being
relied
on
by
the
hearing
examiner
or
the
doctor’s
personal
testimony
being
relied
on
by
the
hearing
examiner,
even
though
i
knew
both
were
adverse
to
me,
i
would
rather
ask
the
doctors
there.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
it
was
a
decision
that
we
made
that
we
felt
that
if
we
had
asked
the
doctor
to
be
there
in
effect
number
one;
we
would
be
vouching
for
the
doctor,
number
two
we
would
have
had
to
pay
for
the
doctor
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
but
i
have
to
continue
to
practice
law
in
that
community
and
if
you
do
this
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
going
to
be
some
doctors
that
will
always
give
your
clients
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
we’re
not
building
--
in
other
words
what
we’re
saying
is
that
we
just
don’t
have
this
obligation
to
an
effect
disprove
the
government’s
reports.
in
effect,
this
would
mean
that
in
any
administrative
hearing
if
the
government
put
on
the
report
of
a
lawyer
or
an
engineer
or
anything
else
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
let
me
say
this
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
justice
white,
they
don’t
tell
you
that.
they
say
the
reports
were
going
to
rely
on
can
be
examined
you
on
the
morning
of
the
hearing
or
in
the
examiners
office
and
he
is
in
houston
and
it's
not
feasible
to
go
200
miles
to
look
at
the
reports
that
happen
to
be
in
his
office,
we
have
written
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
oh
we
knew
that
we
had
the
right
to
subpoena
the
doctor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
we
did
not
know
all
of
the
reports
that
he
had
in
his
file,
some
of
the
reports
your
honor,
in
fact
all
social
security
reports
that
are
made
are
not
released
to
the
claimant.
it's
against
social
security
--
we
have
attempted
to
get
them
in
other
cases
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
social
security
administrations
has
come
in
and
said
this
are
not
to
be
released
to
the
claimant
the
man
that
was
examined.
because
under
the
federal
regulations
they’re
absolutely
privileged
so
the
only
time
you
can
see
them
is
when
the
hearing
examiner's
file
is
open
to
you
which
means
either
going
to
houston
to
look
at
them
or
on
the
morning
of
the
hearing.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
that
would
satisfy
me.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
it's
our
position
that
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no,
no,
no
that’s
our
point
on
the
medical
advisor.
our
point
is
that
the
government’s
evidence
as
to
no
disability
was
only
reports.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
would
object
to
that,
i
would
say
his
opinion
could
be
only
on
his
examination
of
the
man.
in
other
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
that’s
another
matter.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
think,
he
can
read
the
reports
but
he
must
form
his
own
independent
evaluation.
in
other
words
he
can
say,
i
read
this
reports
and
i
disagree
with
them.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir
that
would
satisfy
me.
mr.
richard
tinsman
what
we
want
is
a
man
that’s
examined
him
to
testify
in
the
hearing,
yes
sir
and
our
position
on
this
medical
advisor
thing
is
if
they
really
believe
in
these
doctors
whose
reports
they
say
are
inherently
right,
why
don’t
they
just
bring
one
of
those
doctors
to
be
the
medical
advisor
rather
than
bringing
in
a
man
who
has
never
examined
the
man.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
claimant
has
the
burden
of
proof
your
honor
and
he
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
when
we
bring
our
doctor
who
testifies
that
this
man
is
totally
disabled,
your
honor
we
feel
that
we
have
met
our
burden
of
proof
and
then
the
burden
of
--
if
the
government
wishes
to
contest
this,
then
they
must
come
in
with
proof
that
says
no,
your
doctor
is
wrong,
he
is
not
disabled.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
if
we
really
feel
that
what
mr.
justice
brennan
said
in
goldberg
is
that
in
almost
every
setting
where
important
decisions
turn
on
questions
of
fact
due
process
requires
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
adverse
witnesses
that
this
would
be
highly
suspect
as
a
violation
of
due
process.
that
congress
cannot
provide
this.
now
the
court
said
that
almost
every
situation
is
for
this
court
to
determine
which
are
the
exemptions.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
thank
you
very
much.
