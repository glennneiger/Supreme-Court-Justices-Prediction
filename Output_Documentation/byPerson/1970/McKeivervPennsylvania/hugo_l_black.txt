black
what
about
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
which
one
do
you
think
are
left
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
a
juvenile
can
be
given
any
different
trial
under
the
constitution
who
is
charged
with
an
offense
for
which
he
can
be
sent
to

10
years
and
an
adult
here?

l.
black
december
2nd.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
findings
in
the

of
this
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
relevant
but
true.

on
the
legal
issue
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do

correction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
whether
you
call
it
correction
on
this
the
result
of
these
convictions
is
that
a
person
can
be
confined
for
a
number
or
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
can
be
confined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
like
any
prisoner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
do
they
turn
him
in
loose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
could
be
done
by
other
prisoner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
is
your
definition
of
a
juvenile
point
of
age?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
which
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
crimes
are
committed
by
people
under
21?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
do
it
then
you
--
i
understood
you’d
argued
this
at
all,
the
fundamentally
unfair
they
couldn’t
do
it.
could
they
do
it?
majority
of
the
court
will
hold
that
it's
fundamentally
unfair?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
possible
for
him
to
find
delinquency,
that
he’s
guilty
of
delinquency
without
also
finding
he
had
been
guilty
of
some
kind
of
conduct
that
is
prohibited
by
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
you
call
it
delinquency
or
not
call
it
delinquency,
in
any
instances
the
purpose
of
the
court
is
to
find
out
if
he
is
engaged
in
some
conduct
that
violates
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
necessary
in
every
case
of
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
have
two
persons
up
before
the
court,
one
of
them
is
20
years,
364
days
old,
one
of
them
is
21
years
of
age
who
committed
the
same
acts,
you
mean
that
under
the
law,
they
could
be
treated
differently
by
reason
of
that
one
day
as
difference
in
age?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
deciding
constitutionality
of
the
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
tell
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
there
be
any
likelihood
that
the
percentage
would
be
any
greater
by
asking
a
child
by
jury
among
the
juveniles
and
the
adults?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
226
of
what
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
adult
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
there
be
any
more
than
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
rule
out
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
suggest
there’s
(inaudible)
that
twice
when
you’re
referred
to
the
value
of
jury
trial,
at
least
thrice,
you
will
not
say
this
just
because
it’s
under
constitution,
you
said
it's
good
because
it's
tradition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
course
of
the
constitution,
i’m
not
talking
more
about
this
issue.
you

that
