justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
meltsner,
at
that
point
and
perhaps
this
is
an
unfair
question,
would
you
hazard
a
guess
as
to
what
would
have
happened
have
there
been
a
jury
trial
at
that
time
in
north
carolina?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
new
laws,
excuse
me.
i
was
going
to
say
you’d
also
hazard
a
guess
then
that
had
a
jury
trial
been
available
that
opportunity
would
have
been
taken
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
this
because
of
the
statements
in
the
briefs
that
if
a
jury,
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
were
present
that
nevertheless
the
exercise
of
the
right
would
or
has
been
rather
sparse
in
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
this
argument
to
batters
the
position
that
imposing
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
will
not
overwhelm
the
juvenile
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
meltsner,
could
i
ask
you
first
before
you
go
on.
would
anticipate
that
the
jury
trial
you're
requesting
would
involve
submitting
to
the
jury
only
the
question
of
whether
the
acts
charged
were
committed
or
whether
you
would
want
the
jury
to
decide
the
ultimate
issue
of
delinquency
or
is
there
in
north
carolina
any
difference
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
under
current
law
there
if
the
act
is
found
to
have
been
committed
its
automatic
--
there’s
an
automatic
conclusion
of
delinquency?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
in
some
places
that
isn’t
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
--
but
right
now
there’s
no
room
for
a
judge
saying
he
may
have
committed
this
act
but
he
is
not
a
delinquent
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
room
for
that
under
the
national
--
north
carolina
law,
would
you
insist
that
the
jury
be
given
the
task
of
deciding
on
delinquency
as
well
as
the
task
of
deciding
whether
the
act
was
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
be
content
if
the
jury
only
had
the
task
of
deciding
whether
the
act
was
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
delinquency
in
that
situation
may
depend
on
a
whole
series
of
other
facts
that
may
depend
on
the
whole
juvenile
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
which
you
could
say
relevant
in
north
carolina
--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
present
law,
but
not
under
the
law
at
the
time
of
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
meltsner,
help
me
in
another
respect,
to
what
extent
does
the
north
carolina
juvenile
court
have,
what
shall
i
say,
jurisdiction
over
juveniles,
can
they
put
them
on
probation
or
under
one
control
or
another,
how
long
until
21?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
younger
--
the
alleged
defender
is
the
longer
his
possible
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
a
boy
is
20,
he
has
less
risk
than
one
who
is
16
so
far
as
duration
of
control
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
not
saying
that
the
criminal
proceeding
throughout
purposes
subject
to
all
the
requirements
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
meltsner,
do
you
think
the
next
case
however
will
demand
the
public
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
must
we
decide
this
as
a
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
district
court
judges
could
not
sit
on
the
superior
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
all
your
district
court
judges’
lawyers?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
district
court
judges
do
things
other
than
juvenile
work
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
your
district
court
judges
are
chosen
or
by
experience
of
the
--
or
especially
qualified
in
the
juvenile
work
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
your
trials
--
assessment
for
trials?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
oh
yes!
but
would
you
--
how
about
the
choices
on
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
your
choice
on
the
cases
that
actually
went
to
trial,
what
was
--
jury
or
bench?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
and
that’s
what
you
said
but
i
wondered
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
what
jury
trial
is
all
about
in
many
respects.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
in
your
state
are
newspapers
permitted
to
print
the
details
of
juvenile
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
in
those
states
that
now
have
jury
trial,
what
is
the
issue
that’s
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
most
of
the
states
if
he
does
this
act,
its
automatic
he’s
a
delinquent?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
some
states
that
just
asked
the
jury,
did
he
do
the
act
and
that's
--
and
then
the
judge
still
has
to
decide
whether
he
is
a
delinquent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
extra
--
that
area
of
discretion
is
not
one
of
juries
exercise?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
north
carolina
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let
me
ask
you,
the
jury
trial
that
you're
contending
for
would
be
a
jury
trial
only
to
consider
whether
the
act
was
committed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
real
relevance
between
--
any
connection
between
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
rehabilitation
condition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
was
the
relevance
of
the
material
you
submitted
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
understand
you
to
indicate
that
in
pennsylvania,
there’s
no
effort
in
the
juvenile
court
system
to
protect
the
juvenile
from
the
stigma
that
many
times
attaches
to
the
criminal
trials
or
convictions
of
adults?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
the
juvenile
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
police
can’t
maintain
a
parallel
set
of
records
of
what
happens
in
the
juvenile
court
because
they
don’t
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
they
were
--
the
police
have
a
practice
releasing
them
directly?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
police
--
i
mean
in
--
police
make
the
arrest
of
juveniles
all
around
the
country
and
turn
them
over
to
the
juvenile
authorities
and
you’re
just
saying
that
in
pennsylvania
they
make
a
record
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
they
get
the
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
the
law
require
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
what
does
it
require
to
terms
of
confidentiality
of
juvenile
court
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
include
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
directly
from
the
juvenile
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
a
separate
juvenile
court
system
don’t
you
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
throughout
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
basic
constitutional
position,
is
it
a
--
is
it
a
due
process
argument
or
are
you
saying
this
is
a
straight
and
simple
criminal
proceeding
in
the
sixth
amendment
right
rest
upon
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
weren’t
--
you
weren’t
saying
that
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding
and
therefore
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’d
still
i
suppose
have
a
juvenile
present
when
you’re
choosing
a
jury
and
to
the
extent
that
you’re
--
you
need
a
large
panel
up
there
to
get
a
jury
while
you’re
going
to
have
a
lot
of
people
knowing
about
the
trial
that’s
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
to
articulate
perhaps
what
you
think
the
jury
trial
will
do
to
juveniles
and
their
parents?
you’ve
talked
a
lot
about
factual
doing
and
what
--
why
aren't
juvenile
so
interested
in
having
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
your
own
views,
the
juries
contribute
to
accurate
fact
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
7%.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
7%.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
you’ll
get
significantly
different
results
in
jury
cases
than
with
the
judge
cases
in
the
juvenile
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
a
lawyer
in
your
prediction,
your
prediction,
would
you
say
you’re
going
to
get
significantly
different
results?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
necessarily
have
arrest
records
because
they
make
the
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
public
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
wanted
to
hire
a
young
man
and
was
interested
in
knowing
if
he
had
an
arrest
record,
and
i
wrote
the
police
up
there,
would
they
tell
me
whether
or
not
he
had
an
arrest
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
they
say
it’s
none
of
your
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
true
of
almost
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
specter,
in
pennsylvania
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
isn’t
a
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
automatic
when
it’s
found
that
he
committed
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
pennsylvania,
when
a
juvenile
judge
tries
a
young
man
for
committing
an
act
which
would
be
a
felony
committed
by
an
adult,
does
he
at
that
time
have
the
probation
officer's
report
on
the
young
man?
or
the
juvenile
court
officers
report
on
the
young
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
he
--
he
surely
then.
if
you
say
it’s
a
two
states
process,
he
must
have
the
report
after
he
finds
he
committed
the
act
and
before
he
decides
whether
he’s
delinquent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
it
was
a
jury
question
or
a
judge
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
delinquency?
justice
byron
r.
white
separate
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
specter,
2%
of
your
adults
actually
go
to
trial
court
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
follows
from
that
argument
like
it
does
in
the
juvenile
--
in
the
context
of
the
juveniles
that
you
should
dispense
with
jury
trials
in
the
adult
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short
you
think
that
that
2%
that
want
the
jury
isn’t
important
enough
consideration
to
retain
the
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
though
by
reading
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
the
judge
does
that,
it’s
because
after
he
has
found
the
facts,
perhaps
he
has
some
other
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
but
now
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
the
pennsylvania,
does
the
judge
have
the
juvenile’s
record
before
he
makes
the
determination
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
he
has
it
once
he’s
made
the
finding
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
meltsner,
at
that
point
and
perhaps
this
is
an
unfair
question,
would
you
hazard
a
guess
as
to
what
would
have
happened
have
there
been
a
jury
trial
at
that
time
in
north
carolina?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
new
laws,
excuse
me.
i
was
going
to

you’d

those
states
that
now
have
jury
trial,
what
is
the
issue
that’s
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
most
of
the
states
if
he
does
this
act,
its
automatic
he’s
a
delinquent?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
some
states
that
just
asked
the
jury,
did
he
do
the
act
and
that's
--
and
then
the
judge
still
has
to
decide
whether
he
is
a
delinquent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
extra
--
that
area
of
discretion
is
not
one
of
juries
exercise?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
north
carolina
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let
me
ask
you,
the
jury
trial
that
you're
contending
for
would
be
a
jury
trial
only
to
consider
whether
the
act
was
committed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
real
relevance
between
--
any
connection
between
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
rehabilitation
condition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
was
the
relevance
of
the
material
you
submitted
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
understand
you
to
indicate
that
in
pennsylvania,
there’s
no
effort
in
the
juvenile
court
system
to
protect
the
juvenile
from
the
stigma
that
many
times
attaches
to
the
criminal
trials
or
convictions
of
adults?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
the
juvenile
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
police
can’t
maintain
a
parallel
set
of
records
of
what
happens
in
the
juvenile
court
because
they
don’t
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
they
were
--
the
police
have
a
practice
releasing
them
directly?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
police
--
i
mean
in
--
police
make
the
arrest
of
juveniles
all
around
the
country
and
turn
them
over
to
the
juvenile
authorities
and
you’re
just
saying
that
in
pennsylvania
they
make
a
record
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
they
get
the
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
the
law
require
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
what
does
it
require
to
terms
of
confidentiality
of
juvenile
court
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
include
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
directly
from
the
juvenile
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
a
separate
juvenile
court
system
don’t
you
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
throughout
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
basic
constitutional
position,
is
it
a
--
is
it
a
due
process
argument
or
are
you
saying
this
is
a
straight
and
simple
criminal
proceeding
in
the
sixth
amendment
right
rest
upon
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
weren’t
--
you
weren’t
saying
that
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding
and
therefore
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you’d
still
i
suppose
have
a
juvenile
present
when
you’re
choosing
a
jury
and
to
the
extent
that
you’re
--
you
need
a
large
panel
up
there
to
get
a
jury
while
you’re
going
to
have
a
lot
of
people
knowing
about
the
trial
that’s
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
to
articulate
perhaps
what
you
think
the
jury
trial
will
do
to
juveniles
and
their
parents?
you’ve
talked
a
lot
about
factual
doing
and
what
--
why
aren't
juvenile
so
interested
in
having
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
your
own
views,
the
juries
contribute
to
accurate
fact
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
7%.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
7%.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
you’ll
get
significantly
different
results
in
jury
cases
than
with
the
judge
cases
in
the
juvenile
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
a
lawyer
in
your
prediction,
your
prediction,
would
you
say
you’re
going
to
get
significantly
different
results?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
necessarily
have
arrest
records
because
they
make
the
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
public
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
wanted
to
hire
a
young
man
and
was
interested
in
knowing
if
he
had
an
arrest
record,
and
i
wrote
the
police
up
there,
would
they
tell
me
whether
or
not
he
had
an
arrest
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
they
say
it’s
none
of
your
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
true
of
almost
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
specter,
in
pennsylvania
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
isn’t
a
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
automatic
when
it’s
found
that
he
committed
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
pennsylvania,
when
a
juvenile
judge
tries
a
young
man
for
committing
an
act
which
would
be
a
felony
committed
by
an
adult,
does
he
at
that
time
have
the
probation
officer's
report
on
the
young
man?
or
the
juvenile
court
officers
report
on
the
young
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
he
--
he
surely
then.
if
you
say
it’s
a
two
states
process,
he
must
have
the
report
after
he
finds
he
committed
the
act
and
before
he
decides
whether
he’s
delinquent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
it
was
a
jury
question
or
a
judge
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
delinquency?
justice
byron
r.
white
separate
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
specter,
2%
of
your
adults
actually
go
to
trial
court
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
follows
from
that
argument
like
it
does
in
the
juvenile
--
in
the
context
of
the
juveniles
that
you
should
dispense
with
jury
trials
in
the
adult
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short
you
think
that
that
2%
that
want
the
jury
isn’t
important
enough
consideration
to
retain
the
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
though
by
reading
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
the
judge
does
that,
it’s
because
after
he
has
found
the
facts,
perhaps
he
has
some
other
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
but
now
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
the
pennsylvania,
does
the
judge
have
the
juvenile’s
record
before
he
makes
the
determination
of
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
he
has
it
once
he’s
made
the
finding
of
fact?
