mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
review
the
court’s
judgment
that
petitioners
over
40
black
youths
between
the
ages
of
11
and
15
were
not
entitled
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
trial
by
jury
in
juvenile
court
proceedings
held
to
determine
whether
they
had
violated
state
criminal
laws.
cases
arose
out
of
a
conflict
between
black
and
whites
in
hyde
county
north
carolina
over
the
manner
in
which
the
county
school
board
chose
to
implement
this
court’s
decision
in
brown
versus
board
of
education.
as
a
result,
almost
the
entire
black
population
boycott
at
the
public
schools
in
1968.
during
the
months
of
september
through
december,
the
petitioners
were
taken
into
custody
by
state
police
and
charged
with
willfully,
intentionally,
and
unlawfully
impeding
highway
traffic
in
violations
of
the
state
criminal
statute
which
at
the
time
of
trial
provided
a
two-year
maximum
penalty
for
adults.
one
juvenile
was
charged
with
willfully
becoming
disorderly
and
defacing
school
property
in
violation
of
two
other
state
criminal
statutes
which
at
the
time
of
trial
imposed
a
maximum
penalty
of
two
years
imprisonment
for
adults.
petitioners
were
tried
in
several
groups
in
the
district
court
of
hyde
county
--
a
court
of
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
sitting
as
a
juvenile
court.
in
each
case,
with
the
exception
of
the
one
juvenile
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
and
defacement
of
property,
a
police
officer
testified
to
observing
groups
of
black
youths
marching
and
singing,
carrying
signs,
playing
catch
with
the
basketball,
all
in
such
a
manner
as
to
stop
cars
on
a
public
road.
according
to
police
testimony,
the
petitioners
were
warned
that
they
were
violating
criminal
law
in
order
to
disperse.
when
they
did
not
do
so,
they
were
arrested.
the
trial
judge
found
that
each
petitioner
had
committed
an
act
for
which
an
adult
may
be
punished
by
north
carolina
law
was
in
need
of
care,
protection,
and
discipline
from
the
state
and
was
thereby
delinquent.
immediately
after
finding
petitioners
delinquent,
the
court
sentence
each
to
a
state
institution
for
an
indefinite
term
until
released
by
the
state
board
of
juvenile
corrections
or
until
reaching
majority.
thus,
petitioners
could
have
been
incarcerated
all
from
six
to
ten
years
respectively
then
the
court
suspended
the
sentence
to
probation.
on
appeal,
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
give
the
juvenile
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings
even
though
he
may
be
incarcerated
for
many
years
as
a
result
of
an
adverse
decision.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
commitment
was
suspended
by
the
trial
court
and
later
excised
from
the
judgment
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
a
technical
modification
of
the
terms
of
the
judgment.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
all
the
petitioners
were
placed
on
probation.
now,
these
petitioners’
submission
that
under
gault,
winship,
and
duncan
taken
together
juvenile
tried
for
violations
of
state
criminal
law
and
subjected
to
incarceration
for
years
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
unless
the
state
shows,
the
state
has
not
shown
here
that
provision
of
trial
by
jury
will
compel
the
state
to
displace
or
abandon
substantial
benefits
conferred
on
the
juvenile
by
the
juvenile
court
system.
this
is
a
question
which
we
believe
is
seen
more
clearly
if
we
first
put
to
one
side
certain
matters
which
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
decide.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
jury
trial
where
a
juvenile
does
not
want
one.
no
claim
is
made
in
this
case.
the
due
process
requires
any
change
in
the
discretion
of
juvenile
authorities
to
divert
cases
from
court
prior
to
trial
for
probation
counseling
action
by
private
or
public
social
agencies
or
physicians.
no
claim
is
made
which
restricts
the
juvenile
court’s
freedom,
the
structured
treatment
or
rehabilitation
to
the
needs
of
the
juvenile
after
he
has
been
adjudicated
a
delinquent.
no
issue
was
present
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
where
the
juvenile
is
not
charged
with
criminal
conduct,
faced
with
the
stigma
with
of
the
delinquency
adjudication
and
subjected
to
what
amounts
to
punitive
incarceration.
and
finally,
no
claim
is
made
that
petitioners
were
entitled
to
trial
in
a
courtroom
open
to
the
public
other
than
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
in
short,
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
to
exclude
the
public
which
north
carolina
law
now
confers
is
not
affected.
now,
petitioners
contend
that
far
from
harming
the
juvenile,
jury
trial
enhances
liability
in
fairness
and
protects
against
the
erroneous
convictions
by
ensuring
compliance
with
the
reasonable-doubt
standard.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
this
case?
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
that
is
as
your
honor
suggests,
it’s
quite
a
guess
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
purely
a
good
case
for
jury
because
the
events
from
which
the
criminal
conduct
arose
are
the
sort
of
events
which
blacks
and
whites
are
likely
to
perceive
in
a
very
different
manner.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
racial
clash
in
this
community
and
so,
well,
i
can’t
for
a
moment
predict
what
the
jury
would
have
decided.
i
do
think
that
the
petitioners
here
would
have
felt
that
they
had
received
the
judgment
of
the
community
and
found
that
that
judgment
more
acceptable
for
that
reason
if
it
was
adverse
to
them.
mr.
michael
meltsner
petitioners
made
timely
motions
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
the
experience
of
the
juvenile
courts
in
the
10
or
11
or
so
states
which
provide
trial
by
jury
has
amply
documented
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
district
of
colombia
public
defender
service
which
survey
the
operation
of
those
courts
in
26
cities
and
towns
in
united
states.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
they
could
not.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
juvenile
court
in
north
carolina
has
exclusive
original
jurisdiction
all
minors
up
to
the
age
of
16
and
these
juveniles
that
were
between
the
ages
of
11
and
15.
when
a
juvenile
is
charged
with
a
felony,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
his
over
the
age
of
14,
the
juvenile
court
may
hold
the
hearing
and
waive
jurisdiction
to
an
adult
court.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
because
the
offenses
were
classified
as
misdemeanors
under
state
law
though
they
were
subject
to
two-year
penalties
at
the
time
of
trial.
now,
the
benefits
which
we
claim
flow
to
the
juvenile
from
the
availability
of
jury
trial.
i
will
somewhat
arbitrarily
describe
as
benefits
flowing
first
from
duncan
case,
second
from
winship,
and
third
a
class
of
special
juvenile
court
advantages.
mr.
michael
meltsner
at
the
time
of
trial,
mr.
justice
white,
there
may
have
been
a
difference
but
state
law
has
been
amended
while
this
case
was
on
appeal
to
make
an
issue
of
delinquency
as
i
read
the
states’
statutes
identical
to
the
question
of
whether
youth
violated
the
state
criminal
law.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
that
is
my
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
my
impression,
yes.
that
in
some
basis
the
law
was
as
it
was
in
north
carolina
that
there
is
a
vague
and
ill-defined
class
of
offenses
which
judge
can
determine
to
be
delinquency.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
my
impression
--
that’s
the
way
i
read
the
statute,
it’s
the
question
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
that
the
jury
would
have
to
be
charged
as
to
the
kind
of
conduct
which
it
was
finding
the
facts
to
determine
a
violation
and
certainly
the
jury
could
find
specific
facts
and
the
judge
could
find
the
--
could
draw
the
legal
(voice
overlap).
mr.
michael
meltsner
under
your
--
let
me
take
it
back
because
i
quite
honestly
mr.
justice
white
hadn't
thought
about
this
before,
but
now,
my
conclusion
is
not
that.
my
conclusion
is
that
that
the
judge
will
have
to
define
in
advance
in
such
a
situation
and
such
a
state
what
delinquency
means
and
if
the
jury
will
find
the
facts
and
also
find
the
law
as
charged
to
the
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
am
not
certain
how
that
would
operate
because
i
don’
really
know
what
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
certainly
do.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i'm
even
unclear
about
the
law
previously
because
i
cannot,
unable
to
find
any
state
court
decisions
dealing
with
the
issue
or
construing
the
statute.
now,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
youth
is
as
likely
as
an
adult
to
profit
from
the
protections
enunciated
by
the
court
in
duncan
against
an
arbitrary
bias,
corrupt
or
over
zealous
judge
or
prosecutor
or
a
case
hardened
judge
or
a
compliant
judge
one
who
perhaps
seems
to
credit
the
least
testimony
because
he
has
seen
police
officer
testified
so
often
against
convicted
defendants
and
likewise
that
the
youth
is
also
as
likely
as
an
adult
to
benefit
from
the
common
sense
and
community
viewpoint
of
the
jury.
in
short,
the
jury
is
a
check
on
the
vast
powers
in
the
trial
judge
and
no
judge
--
no
trial
judge
has
more
power
than
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court.
and
the
judge
who
the
youth
gets
in
exchange
for
his
right
to
jury
trial
is
a
judge
who
is
not
the
miracle
worker
of
juvenile
court
theory.
he
is
not
a
specialist.
in
north
carolina,
he
is
elected,
he
serves
the
court
of
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
and
he
need
not
even
be
a
lawyer.
this
conforms
to
the
national
experience
survey
of
the
president’s
crime
commission
in
1967
showed
that
75%
of
all
juvenile
court
judges
spent
less
than
one
quarter
of
their
time
in
juvenile
court,
20%
were
not
lawyers,
20%
had
no
college
training
whatsoever
and
one-half
had
no
college
degree
and
80%
had
no
regular
psychologist
or
psychiatric
help
in
their
courts.
mr.
michael
meltsner
probation
until
21,
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
under
north
carolina
law
as
it
presently
exist
now,
the
youth
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
until
he
is
21
except
incarceration
will
terminate
at
age
18.
unless
the
state
board
of
juvenile
correction
certifies
that
the
youth
is
in
a
special
program,
a
vocational
training
program
so
should
be
kept.
so
the
extent
of
the
sanction
does
vary
with
age
although
the
juvenile
courts
topped
jurisdictional
age
as
16.
so
there's
always
going
to
be
at
least
two
years
which
the
youth
will
be
subject
to
some
form
of
sanction.
certainly,
the
youth
is
benefited
by
having
a
jury
administered
the
reasonable-doubt
standard
which
this
court
held
he
was
entitled
to
in
winship.
reasonable
doubt
was
formulated
as
a
standard
to
be
administered
by
the
jury
and
it
is
plainly
a
higher
burden
for
the
prosecution
to
persuade
6
or
12
men
to
a
subjective
standard
of
certainty.
in
addition
to
the
weight
of
numbers,
the
jury
gives
content
to
reasonable
doubt
by
making
sure
that
men
with
different
backgrounds
and
perspectives
and
outlooks
concur
in
the
result.
now
there
are
certain
benefits
which
the
jury
trial
gives
which
i
think
are
specially
seen
in
juvenile
court
because
the
juvenile
judge
is
bombarded
with
inadmissible
evidence.
evidence
that
come
to
him
if
he
holds
the
waiver
hearing
which
i
mentioned
before
or
evidence
which
comes
to
him
by
reading
social
reports
describing
the
youth’s
family
and
background
which
north
carolina
law
explicitly
permits
him
to
see
before
adjudication,
before
he
has
made
a
final
determination
of
delinquency
by
section
7a-285.
these
reports
are
that
the
access
of
the
judge
has
to
these
reports
is
easy
because
he
even
hires
and
fires
the
man
who
accumulate
the
information
of
the
probation
officers.
a
second
reason
why
the
jury
trial
is
in
especially
appropriate
protection
for
the
youth
juvenile
court
is
that
the
juvenile
judge
has
traditionally
seen
himself
as
acting
on
the
needs
rather
than
the
deeds
of
the
child.
thus,
he
is
more
likely
to
see
a
finding
of
delinquency
as
a
prelude
to
treatment
rather
than
punishment
and
i
would
submit,
it
will
be
more
difficult
for
him
to
hold
the
balance
true
when
applying
the
reasonable-doubt
standard.
it
simply
easier
to
convict
given
human
nature
when
you
believe
that
some
good
called
rehabilitation
is
presently
practiced
by
the
states
is
a
benefit
to
the
youth
and
will
follow
adjudication
of
delinquency.
now,
it
is
said
in
answer
to
these
benefits
that
making
jury
trials
available
to
juveniles
who
wish
them
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
your
honor,
no
such
question
of
that
sort
is
involved
here,
but
we
think
the
juveniles
have
as
much
right
to
mature
competent
understanding
jury
as
anything
else.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
the
--
this
court
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct,
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
district
court
involved
here
is
the
court
of
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
meltsner
oh!
i
think
that’s
a
matter
for
the
state
to
work
out
in
the
easiest
and
most
flexible
manner
to
hold
a
trial.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
there
is
no
reason
why
it
could
not
be,
there’s
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
in
which
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
it
has
to
deal
with
the
kind
of
judge
who
was
trying
cases
in
juvenile
court
while
some
defendants
may
want
a
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
we
don’t
ask
them.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
we
come
now
to
the
specific
harms
which
are
caused
according
to
the
state
by
introducing
a
jury
trial,
a
juvenile
court
and
i
will
run
through
them
a
very
quickly
the
phrase
used
in
their
brief
i
believe
is
“it
will
rob
the
juvenile
court
of
informality,
flexibility,
and
speed.”
well,
now,
informality
only
appears
informal
as
the
system
presently
is
operated
to
the
officials
involved.
the
youth
feels
that
is
in
the
presence
of
a
quite
formal
and
authoritative
process
to
quote
dean
paulsen,
“he
knows
that
he
is
in
court
not
in
school
or
in
a
doctor’s
office.”
formality
is
difficult
thing
to
measure
but
as
long
as
the
finding
of
delinquency
can
rest
only
on
evidence
given
under
oath
by
witnesses
subject
to
cross-examination
and
confrontation
and
as
long
as
reasonable-doubt
standards
apply.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
certain
amount
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
detach
fact
finding.
and
this
goes
to
what
i
think
is
the
essence
of
this
case
by
virtue
of
this
court’s
decision
and
state
law
juvenile
courts
now
have
an
adversary
fact-
finding
system
indistinguishable
from
the
one
the
court
considered
in
duncan
and
bloom
and
apply
the
jury
of
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
believe
your
honor
that
it’s
a
due
process
question
informed
by
the
incorporation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
true.
that
is
position.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
meltsner
certainly
not.
certainly
not,
only
that
the
fact-finding
stage
is
such
that
the
same
logic
which
required
trial
by
jury
in
duncan
applies
here
and
that
the
states
have
not
presented
any
reason
why
it
should
no
to
“duncan”
alternative
guarantees
and
protections
have
been
provided
in
this
process,
to
take
the
place
of
the
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
justice
black,
our
primary
claim
is
based
on
this
court’s
decision
in
winship
and
if
the
standard
used
there
to
determined
whether
a
reasonable
doubt
applied
to
juvenile
court
proceedings
likewise
requires
trial
by
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
was
decided
in
gault.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
certainly
the
right
to
public
trial
is
one
that
is
left.
i
think
that
as
it
now
stands
the
fact-finding
stage
of
juvenile
court
proceedings
is
an
adversary
proceeding
as
the
same
as
takes
place
in
any
adjudication
where
someone
can
be
imprisoned
and
stigmatized.
mr.
michael
meltsner
sir,
we
make
no
claim
that
he
cannot
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
make
no
claim
that
he
cannot
in
this
case.
we
believe
the
sentencing
or
dispositional
stage
alone
and
make
no
claim
that
the
state
can't
decide
that
because
someone
is
younger
he
should
be
potentially
incarcerated
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
michael
meltsner
our
position
is
the
public
can
be
excluded
under
the
very
standard
which
we
say
here
gives
us
a
right
to
jury
trial
because
including
the
public,
maybe,
that's
not
this
case
but
it
maybe
harm
to
the
juvenile.
and
if
it
is,
then
perhaps
under
due
process
test,
public
can
be
excluded
but
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
our
primary
argument
is
that
this
process
does
not
harm
the
juvenile
giving
him
a
right
to
jury
trial.
it
doesn’t
delay
proceedings
as
the
public
defenders
service’s
brief
has
shown.
even
if
there
is
some
delay,
i
think
the
court
has
crossed
that
bridge
in
baldwin
where
it
applied
right
to
jury
trial
in
the
busiest
court
in
the
united
states
of
america
with
the
biggest
backlog
and
said
that
administrative
convenience
is
--
would
not
inhabit
its
doing
so.
and
finally,
i
think
that
in
the
way
such
delays
our
court
system
has
already
are
complicated
and
are
certainly
not
cause
by
jury
trial
and
given
the
fact
that
delay
the
jury
trial
is
an
essential
protection
because
it
gives
the
defendant
in
a
close
case,
the
case
that
stirred
community
passions
to
a
fresh
fact
finder,
to
someone
who
look
at
his
case
and
not
just
treated
as
another
bit
of
material
on
the
assembly
line.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
michael
meltsner
certainly,
this
court
will
have
to
decide
that
question
at
sometime
but
nothing
decided
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
can
possibly
affect
the
decision
of
that
issue.
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
you
decided
as
a
criminal
proceeding
for
all
purposes,
yes.
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
do
that.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
white
it
dawned
on
me
late
last
night
that
the
question
you
asked
me
yesterday
was
a
question
that
you
just
asked
mr.
scanlan
and
i
must
have
totally
misunderstood
it
and
if
as
i
now
understand
the
question
it
is
whether
after
jury
finds
that
juvenile
has
committed
the
acts
whether
judge
can
nevertheless
decide
that
he
is
not
a
delinquent.
the
answer
i
give
is
an
emphatic
yes
and
that
is
indeed
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
indeed
the
case
under
north
carolina
law
as
best
one
can
tell
of
giving
of
course
the
fact
that
there
are
no
jury
trials.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
if
the
juvenile
court
judge
would
retain
a
flexibility
and
this
is
what
we
think
the
juvenile
court
is
all
about
to
not
adjudicate
the
youth
the
delinquent
regardless
of
the
findings
in
a
jury.
that
is
provided
for
north
carolina
law
and
is
in
fact
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case.
if
one
reads
the
order
of
commitment,
he
first
said,
“you
have
committed
an
act
which
if
an
adult
did
it
that
it
would
be
a
criminal
act
that
he
then
found
delinquency.”
mr.
michael
meltsner
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor,
no.
there
are
in
addition
to
that
several
small
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first
of
all,
the
attorney
general
has
stated
that
he
in
his
judgment
juvenile
case
is
would
have
to
be
automatically
transferred
to
another
court
if
this
court
held
that
the
right
to
jury
trial
applied,
but
i
really
don’t
see
why
he
reached
that
conclusion
because
the
very
court
we’re
concerned
with
here,
the
district
court
presently
tries
civil
cases
with
juries
present
time.
secondly,
the
matter
of
the
reply
brief,
a
matter
which
causes
me
some
embarrassment.
this
brief
was
printed
by
the
court
as
this
case
is
here
in
form
of
corups
(ph)
and
the
brief
was
filed
with
this
court
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said
on
the
2nd
of
december.
but
apparently
the
clerk’s
office
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
did
not
mail
the
briefs
feeling
that
perhaps
they
would
cross
the
lawyers.
when
i
got
here
on
monday,
i
found
this
out,
i
immediately
took
the
brief
to
mr.
scanlan’s
office,
i
took
a
copy
and
serve
mr.
scanlan.
i
took
another
copy
for
mr.
morgan
and
asked
mr.
scanlan
to
please
give
it
to
him
as
soon
as
he
arrived.
now,
this
brief
was
not
submitted
in
reply
to
the
claim
made
by
my
adversaries
that
the
rehabilitated
purposes
of
north
carolina
juvenile
law
justified
denial
by
trial
by
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
don’t
think
so
it’s
because
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
think
its
punitive
incarceration.
i
think
this
court
is
already
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
about
that
it’s
juvenile
institutions
where
totally
different
from
the
rest
and
we
merely
sought
to
dispel
any
such
impression
by
referring
to
a
study
done
under
the
auspices
of
the
duke
law
school
and
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
which
took
some
10
weeks
in
the
summer
of
1969
included
many
law
students,
attorneys
with
the
duke
center
and
site
visits
to
all
the
north
carolina
juvenile
institutions.
and
in
closing,
i
merely
want
to
point
out
that
already
north
carolina
law
provides
that
the
in
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge,
the
court
may
be
opened
and
newspaper
reporters
may
come
in.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
review
the
court’s
judgment
that
petitioners
over
40
black
youths
between
the
ages
of
11
and
15
were
not
entitled
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
trial
by
jury
in
juvenile
court
proceedings
held
to
determine
whether
they
had
violated
state
criminal
laws.
cases
arose
out
of
a
conflict
between
black
and
whites
in
hyde
county
north
carolina
over
the
manner
in
which
the
county
school
board
chose
to
implement
this
court’s
decision
in
brown
versus
board
of
education.
as
a
result,
almost
the
entire
black
population
boycott
at
the
public
schools
in
1968.
during
the
months
of
september
through
december,
the
petitioners
were
taken
into
custody
by
state
police
and
charged
with
willfully,
intentionally,
and
unlawfully
impeding
highway
traffic
in
violations
of
the
state
criminal
statute
which
at
the
time
of
trial
provided
a
two-year
maximum
penalty
for
adults.
one
juvenile
was
charged
with
willfully
becoming
disorderly
and
defacing
school
property
in
violation
of
two
other
state
criminal
statutes
which
at
the
time
of
trial
imposed
a
maximum
penalty
of
two
years
imprisonment
for
adults.
petitioners
were
tried
in
several
groups
in
the
district
court
of
hyde
county
--
a
court
of
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
sitting
as
a
juvenile
court.
in
each
case,
with
the
exception
of
the
one
juvenile
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
and
defacement
of
property,
a
police
officer
testified
to
observing
groups
of
black
youths
marching
and
singing,
carrying
signs,
playing
catch
with
the
basketball,
all
in
such
a
manner
as
to
stop
cars
on
a
public
road.
according
to
police
testimony,
the
petitioners
were
warned
that
they
were
violating
criminal
law
in
order
to
disperse.
when
they
did
not
do
so,
they
were
arrested.
the
trial
judge
found
that
each
petitioner
had
committed
an
act
for
which
an
adult
may
be
punished
by
north
carolina
law
was
in
need
of
care,
protection,
and
discipline
from
the
state
and
was
thereby
delinquent.
immediately
after
finding
petitioners
delinquent,
the
court
sentence
each
to
a
state
institution
for
an
indefinite
term
until
released
by
the
state
board
of
juvenile
corrections
or
until
reaching
majority.
thus,
petitioners
could
have
been
incarcerated
all
from
six
to
ten
years
respectively
then
the
court
suspended
the
sentence
to
probation.
on
appeal,
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
give
the
juvenile
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings
even
though
he
may
be
incarcerated
for
many
years
as
a
result
of
an
adverse
decision.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
commitment
was
suspended
by
the
trial
court
and
later
excised
from
the
judgment
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
a
technical
modification
of
the
terms
of
the
judgment.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
all
the
petitioners
were
placed
on
probation.
now,
these
petitioners’
submission
that
under
gault,
winship,
and
duncan
taken
together
juvenile
tried
for
violations
of
state
criminal
law
and
subjected
to
incarceration
for
years
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
unless
the
state
shows,
the
state
has
not
shown
here
that
provision
of
trial
by
jury
will
compel
the
state
to
displace
or
abandon
substantial
benefits
conferred
on
the
juvenile
by
the
juvenile
court
system.
this
is
a
question
which
we
believe
is
seen
more
clearly
if
we
first
put
to
one
side
certain
matters
which
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
decide.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
jury
trial
where
a
juvenile
does
not
want
one.
no
claim
is
made
in
this
case.
the
due
process
requires
any
change
in
the
discretion
of
juvenile
authorities
to
divert
cases
from
court
prior
to
trial
for
probation
counseling
action
by
private
or
public
social
agencies
or
physicians.
no
claim
is
made
which
restricts
the
juvenile
court’s
freedom,
the
structured
treatment
or
rehabilitation
to
the
needs
of
the
juvenile
after
he
has
been
adjudicated
a
delinquent.
no
issue
was
present
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
where
the
juvenile
is
not
charged
with
criminal
conduct,
faced
with
the
stigma
with
of
the
delinquency
adjudication
and
subjected
to
what
amounts
to
punitive
incarceration.
and
finally,
no
claim
is
made
that
petitioners
were
entitled
to
trial
in
a
courtroom
open
to
the
public
other
than
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
in
short,
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
to
exclude
the
public
which
north
carolina
law
now
confers
is
not
affected.
now,
petitioners
contend
that
far
from
harming
the
juvenile,
jury
trial
enhances
liability
in
fairness
and
protects
against
the
erroneous
convictions
by
ensuring
compliance
with
the
reasonable-doubt
standard.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
this
case?
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
that
is
as
your
honor
suggests,
it’s
quite
a
guess
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
purely
a
good
case
for
jury
because
the
events
from
which
the
criminal
conduct
arose
are
the
sort
of
events
which
blacks
and
whites
are
likely
to
perceive
in
a
very
different
manner.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
racial
clash
in
this
community
and
so,
well,
i
can’t
for
a
moment
predict
what
the
jury
would
have
decided.
i
do
think
that
the
petitioners
here
would
have
felt
that
they
had
received
the
judgment
of
the
community
and
found
that
that
judgment
more
acceptable
for
that
reason
if
it
was
adverse
to
them.
mr.
michael
meltsner
petitioners
made
timely
motions
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
the
experience
of
the
juvenile
courts
in
the
10
or
11
or
so
states
which
provide
trial
by
jury
has
amply
documented
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
district
of
colombia
public
defender
service
which
survey
the
operation
of
those
courts
in
26
cities
and
towns
in
united
states.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
they
could
not.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
juvenile
court
in
north
carolina
has
exclusive
original
jurisdiction
all
minors
up
to
the
age
of
16
and
these
juveniles
that
were
between
the
ages
of
11
and
15.
when
a
juvenile
is
charged
with
a
felony,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
his
over
the
age
of
14,
the
juvenile
court
may
hold
the
hearing
and
waive
jurisdiction
to
an
adult
court.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
because
the
offenses
were
classified
as
misdemeanors
under
state
law
though
they
were
subject
to
two-year
penalties
at
the
time
of
trial.
now,
the
benefits
which
we
claim
flow
to
the
juvenile
from
the
availability
of
jury
trial.
i
will
somewhat
arbitrarily
describe
as
benefits
flowing
first
from
duncan
case,
second
from
winship,
and
third
a
class
of
special
juvenile
court
advantages.
mr.
michael
meltsner
at
the
time
of
trial,
mr.
justice
white,
there
may
have
been
a
difference
but
state
law
has
been
amended
while
this
case
was
on
appeal
to
make
an
issue
of
delinquency
as
i
read
the
states’
statutes
identical
to
the
question
of
whether
youth
violated
the
state
criminal
law.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
that
is
my
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
my
impression,
yes.
that
in
some
basis
the
law
was
as
it
was
in
north
carolina
that
there
is
a
vague
and
ill-defined
class
of
offenses
which
judge
can
determine
to
be
delinquency.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
my
impression
--
that’s
the
way
i
read
the
statute,
it’s
the
question
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
that
the
jury
would
have
to
be
charged
as
to
the
kind
of
conduct
which
it
was
finding
the
facts
to
determine
a
violation
and
certainly
the
jury
could
find
specific
facts
and
the
judge
could
find
the
--
could
draw
the
legal
(voice
overlap).
mr.
michael
meltsner
under
your
--
let
me
take
it
back
because
i
quite
honestly
mr.
justice
white
hadn't
thought
about
this
before,
but
now,
my
conclusion
is
not
that.
my
conclusion
is
that
that
the
judge
will
have
to
define
in
advance
in
such
a
situation
and
such
a
state
what
delinquency
means
and
if
the
jury
will
find
the
facts
and
also
find
the
law
as
charged
to
the
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
am
not
certain
how
that
would
operate
because
i
don’
really
know
what
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
certainly
do.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i'm
even
unclear
about
the
law
previously
because
i
cannot,
unable
to
find
any
state
court
decisions
dealing
with
the
issue
or
construing
the
statute.
now,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
youth
is
as
likely
as
an
adult
to
profit
from
the
protections
enunciated
by
the
court
in
duncan
against
an
arbitrary
bias,
corrupt
or
over
zealous
judge
or
prosecutor
or
a
case
hardened
judge
or
a
compliant
judge
one
who
perhaps
seems
to
credit
the
least
testimony
because
he
has
seen
police
officer
testified
so
often
against
convicted
defendants
and
likewise
that
the
youth
is
also
as
likely
as
an
adult
to
benefit
from
the
common
sense
and
community
viewpoint
of
the
jury.
in
short,
the
jury
is
a
check
on
the
vast
powers
in
the
trial
judge
and
no
judge
--
no
trial
judge
has
more
power
than
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court.
and
the
judge
who
the
youth
gets
in
exchange
for
his
right
to
jury
trial
is
a
judge
who
is
not
the
miracle
worker
of
juvenile
court
theory.
he
is
not
a
specialist.
in
north
carolina,
he
is
elected,
he
serves
the
court
of
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
and
he
need
not
even
be
a
lawyer.
this
conforms
to
the
national
experience
survey
of
the
president’s
crime
commission
in
1967
showed
that
75%
of
all
juvenile
court
judges
spent
less
than
one
quarter
of
their
time
in
juvenile
court,
20%
were
not
lawyers,
20%
had
no
college
training
whatsoever
and
one-half
had
no
college
degree
and
80%
had
no
regular
psychologist
or
psychiatric
help
in
their
courts.
mr.
michael
meltsner
probation
until
21,
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
under
north
carolina
law
as
it
presently
exist
now,
the
youth
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
until
he
is
21
except
incarceration
will
terminate
at
age
18.
unless
the
state
board
of
juvenile
correction
certifies
that
the
youth
is
in
a
special
program,
a
vocational
training
program
so
should
be
kept.
so
the
extent
of
the
sanction
does
vary
with
age
although
the
juvenile
courts
topped
jurisdictional
age
as
16.
so
there's
always
going
to
be
at
least
two
years
which
the
youth
will
be
subject
to
some
form
of
sanction.
certainly,
the
youth
is
benefited
by
having
a
jury
administered
the
reasonable-doubt
standard
which
this
court
held
he
was
entitled
to
in
winship.
reasonable
doubt
was
formulated
as
a
standard
to
be
administered
by
the
jury
and
it
is
plainly
a
higher
burden
for
the
prosecution
to
persuade
6
or
12
men
to
a
subjective
standard
of
certainty.
in
addition
to
the
weight
of
numbers,
the
jury
gives
content
to
reasonable
doubt
by
making
sure
that
men
with
different
backgrounds
and
perspectives
and
outlooks
concur
in
the
result.
now
there
are
certain
benefits
which
the
jury
trial
gives
which
i
think
are
specially
seen
in
juvenile
court
because
the
juvenile
judge
is
bombarded
with
inadmissible
evidence.
evidence
that
come
to
him
if
he
holds
the
waiver
hearing
which
i
mentioned
before
or
evidence
which
comes
to
him
by
reading
social
reports
describing
the
youth’s
family
and
background
which
north
carolina
law
explicitly
permits
him
to
see
before
adjudication,
before
he
has
made
a
final
determination
of
delinquency
by
section
7a-285.
these
reports
are
that
the
access
of
the
judge
has
to
these
reports
is
easy
because
he
even
hires
and
fires
the
man
who
accumulate
the
information
of
the
probation
officers.
a
second
reason
why
the
jury
trial
is
in
especially
appropriate
protection
for
the
youth
juvenile
court
is
that
the
juvenile
judge
has
traditionally
seen
himself
as
acting
on
the
needs
rather
than
the
deeds
of
the
child.
thus,
he
is
more
likely
to
see
a
finding
of
delinquency
as
a
prelude
to
treatment
rather
than
punishment
and
i
would
submit,
it
will
be
more
difficult
for
him
to
hold
the
balance
true
when
applying
the
reasonable-doubt
standard.
it
simply
easier
to
convict
given
human
nature
when
you
believe
that
some
good
called
rehabilitation
is
presently
practiced
by
the
states
is
a
benefit
to
the
youth
and
will
follow
adjudication
of
delinquency.
now,
it
is
said
in
answer
to
these
benefits
that
making
jury
trials
available
to
juveniles
who
wish
them
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
your
honor,
no
such
question
of
that
sort
is
involved
here,
but
we
think
the
juveniles
have
as
much
right
to
mature
competent
understanding
jury
as
anything
else.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
the
--
this
court
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct,
yes.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
district
court
involved
here
is
the
court
of
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
meltsner
oh!
i
think
that’s
a
matter
for
the
state
to
work
out
in
the
easiest
and
most
flexible
manner
to
hold
a
trial.
mr.
michael
meltsner
correct.
mr.
michael
meltsner
there
is
no
reason
why
it
could
not
be,
there’s
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
in
which
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
it
has
to
deal
with
the
kind
of
judge
who
was
trying
cases
in
juvenile
court
while
some
defendants
may
want
a
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
we
don’t
ask
them.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
we
come
now
to
the
specific
harms
which
are
caused
according
to
the
state
by
introducing
a
jury
trial,
a
juvenile
court
and
i
will
run
through
them
a
very
quickly
the
phrase
used
in
their
brief
i
believe
is
“it
will
rob
the
juvenile
court
of
informality,
flexibility,
and
speed.”
well,
now,
informality
only
appears
informal
as
the
system
presently
is
operated
to
the
officials
involved.
the
youth
feels
that
is
in
the
presence
of
a
quite
formal
and
authoritative
process
to
quote
dean
paulsen,
“he
knows
that
he
is
in
court
not
in
school
or
in
a
doctor’s
office.”
formality
is
difficult
thing
to
measure
but
as
long
as
the
finding
of
delinquency
can
rest
only
on
evidence
given
under
oath
by
witnesses
subject
to
cross-examination
and
confrontation
and
as
long
as
reasonable-doubt
standards
apply.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
certain
amount
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
detach
fact
finding.
and
this
goes
to
what
i
think
is
the
essence
of
this
case
by
virtue
of
this
court’s
decision
and
state
law
juvenile
courts
now
have
an
adversary
fact-
finding
system
indistinguishable
from
the
one
the
court
considered
in
duncan
and
bloom
and
apply
the
jury
of
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
believe
your
honor
that
it’s
a
due
process
question
informed
by
the
incorporation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
true.
that
is
position.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
meltsner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
meltsner
certainly
not.
certainly
not,
only
that
the
fact-finding
stage
is
such
that
the
same
logic
which
required
trial
by
jury
in
duncan
applies
here
and
that
the
states
have
not
presented
any
reason
why
it
should
no
to
“duncan”
alternative
guarantees
and
protections
have
been
provided
in
this
process,
to
take
the
place
of
the
jury
trial.
mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
justice
black,
our
primary
claim
is
based
on
this
court’s
decision
in
winship
and
if
the
standard
used
there
to
determined
whether
a
reasonable
doubt
applied
to
juvenile
court
proceedings
likewise
requires
trial
by
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
was
decided
in
gault.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
certainly
the
right
to
public
trial
is
one
that
is
left.
i
think
that
as
it
now
stands
the
fact-finding
stage
of
juvenile
court
proceedings
is
an
adversary
proceeding
as
the
same
as
takes
place
in
any
adjudication
where
someone
can
be
imprisoned
and
stigmatized.
mr.
michael
meltsner
sir,
we
make
no
claim
that
he
cannot
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
make
no
claim
that
he
cannot
in
this
case.
we
believe
the
sentencing
or
dispositional
stage
alone
and
make
no
claim
that
the
state
can't
decide
that
because
someone
is
younger
he
should
be
potentially
incarcerated
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
michael
meltsner
our
position
is
the
public
can
be
excluded
under
the
very
standard
which
we
say
here
gives
us
a
right
to
jury
trial
because
including
the
public,
maybe,
that's
not
this
case
but
it
maybe
harm
to
the
juvenile.
and
if
it
is,
then
perhaps
under
due
process
test,
public
can
be
excluded
but
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
our
primary
argument
is
that
this
process
does
not
harm
the
juvenile
giving
him
a
right
to
jury
trial.
it
doesn’t
delay
proceedings
as
the
public
defenders
service’s
brief
has
shown.
even
if
there
is
some
delay,
i
think
the
court
has
crossed
that
bridge
in
baldwin
where
it
applied
right
to
jury
trial
in
the
busiest
court
in
the
united
states
of
america
with
the
biggest
backlog
and
said
that
administrative
convenience
is
--
would
not
inhabit
its
doing
so.
and
finally,
i
think
that
in
the
way
such
delays
our
court
system
has
already
are
complicated
and
are
certainly
not
cause
by
jury
trial
and
given
the
fact
that
delay
the
jury
trial
is
an
essential
protection
because
it
gives
the
defendant
in
a
close
case,
the
case
that
stirred
community
passions
to
a
fresh
fact
finder,
to
someone
who
look
at
his
case
and
not
just
treated
as
another
bit
of
material
on
the
assembly
line.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
michael
meltsner
certainly,
this
court
will
have
to
decide
that
question
at
sometime
but
nothing
decided
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
can
possibly
affect
the
decision
of
that
issue.
mr.
michael
meltsner
if
you
decided
as
a
criminal
proceeding
for
all
purposes,
yes.
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
do
that.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
meltsner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
white
it
dawned
on
me
late
last
night
that
the
question
you
asked
me
yesterday
was
a
question
that
you
just
asked
mr.
scanlan
and
i
must
have
totally
misunderstood
it
and
if
as
i
now
understand
the
question
it
is
whether
after
jury
finds
that
juvenile
has
committed
the
acts
whether
judge
can
nevertheless
decide
that
he
is
not
a
delinquent.
the
answer
i
give
is
an
emphatic
yes
and
that
is
indeed
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
indeed
the
case
under
north
carolina
law
as
best
one
can
tell
of
giving
of
course
the
fact
that
there
are
no
jury
trials.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
if
the
juvenile
court
judge
would
retain
a
flexibility
and
this
is
what
we
think
the
juvenile
court
is
all
about
to
not
adjudicate
the
youth
the
delinquent
regardless
of
the
findings
in
a
jury.
that
is
provided
for
north
carolina
law
and
is
in
fact
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case.
if
one
reads
the
order
of
commitment,
he
first
said,
“you
have
committed
an
act
which
if
an
adult
did
it
that
it
would
be
a
criminal
act
that
he
then
found
delinquency.”
mr.
michael
meltsner
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor,
no.
there
are
in
addition
to
that
several
small
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first
of
all,
the
attorney
general
has
stated
that
he
in
his
judgment
juvenile
case
is
would
have
to
be
automatically
transferred
to
another
court
if
this
court
held
that
the
right
to
jury
trial
applied,
but
i
really
don’t
see
why
he
reached
that
conclusion
because
the
very
court
we’re
concerned
with
here,
the
district
court
presently
tries
civil
cases
with
juries
present
time.
secondly,
the
matter
of
the
reply
brief,
a
matter
which
causes
me
some
embarrassment.
this
brief
was
printed
by
the
court
as
this
case
is
here
in
form
of
corups
(ph)
and
the
brief
was
filed
with
this
court
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said
on
the
2nd
of
december.
but
apparently
the
clerk’s
office
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
did
not
mail
the
briefs
feeling
that
perhaps
they
would
cross
the
lawyers.
when
i
got
here
on
monday,
i
found
this
out,
i
immediately
took
the
brief
to
mr.
scanlan’s
office,
i
took
a
copy
and
serve
mr.
scanlan.
i
took
another
copy
for
mr.
morgan
and
asked
mr.
scanlan
to
please
give
it
to
him
as
soon
as
he
arrived.
now,
this
brief
was
not
submitted
in
reply
to
the
claim
made
by
my
adversaries
that
the
rehabilitated
purposes
of
north
carolina
juvenile
law
justified
denial
by
trial
by
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
don’t
think
so
it’s
because
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
don’t
think
so
because
i
think
its
punitive
incarceration.
i
think
this
court
is
already
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
about
that
it’s
juvenile
institutions
where
totally
different
from
the
rest
and
we
merely
sought
to
dispel
any
such
impression
by
referring
to
a
study
done
under
the
auspices
of
the
duke
law
school
and
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
which
took
some
10
weeks
in
the
summer
of
1969
included
many
law
students,
attorneys
with
the
duke
center
and
site
visits
to
all
the
north
carolina
juvenile
institutions.
and
in
closing,
i
merely
want
to
point
out
that
already
north
carolina
law
provides
that
the
in
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
judge,
the
court
may
be
opened
and
newspaper
reporters
may
come
in.
thank
you.
