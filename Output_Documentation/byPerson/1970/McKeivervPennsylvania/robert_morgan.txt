mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
and
i'm
robert
morgan
representing
the
state
of
north
carolina.
as
i
heard
the
arguments
of
the
petitioner
yesterday
and
as
i
study
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
i
find
that
one
threat
that
runs
throughout
the
briefs
and
throughout
the
arguments
is
the
contention
that
the
juvenile
correction
system
in
north
carolina
is
--
affords
no
treatment
different
from
that
which
criminals
would
receive.
now,
on
tuesday
night
when
i
arrived
in
the
office
of
mr.
scanlan
here
in
washington,
i
was
handed
a
copy
of
the
petitioner’s
reply
brief
for
the
first
time.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
other
briefs
in
this
case
had
been
on
file
for
several
months
and
i
find
it
somewhat
ironical
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
so
question
seems
to
be
a
--
the
question
a
one
of
procedural
due
process
where
the
petitioner’s
plead
in
their
brief
as
they
do
on
page
18
and
page
19
for
more
formality
in
the
courts
where
they
complained
that
the
courts
often
ignore
the
established
rules
of
evidence,
where
they
complain
that
the
judges
and
the
courts
are
often
subjected
to
inadmissible
evidence
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
should
submit
to
this
court
on
the
eleventh
power
a
brief
contained
what
i
believe
to
be
distorted,
misleading
and
actually
false
representations
of
the
north
carolina
juvenile
correctional
system.
they
cite
in
their
brief
and
the
so
citation
for
their
position.
a
purported
report
made
by
group
of
law
students
from
duke
university.
none
of
them
are
identified
by
name.
a
copy
of
their
poor
report
has
not
been
made
available
to
me
nor
has
it
been
published
or
distributed
to
my
knowledge.
a
telephone
call
to
the
north
carolina
director
of
juvenile
corrections,
he
informed
me
that
he
had
not
been
supplied
with
a
copy
of
that
brief.
now,
although
he
did
agree
that
back
in
the
summer
of
1969,
he
had
agreed
for
some
law
students
to
spend
a
week
in
each
one
of
the
correctional
institutions.
neither
today
has
not
been
time
for
me
to
refute
the
accusations
made
in
this
reply
brief,
but
nor
would
i
attempt
to
do
so
if
time
were
available
because
i
think
such
accusations
or
such
information
should
be
more
properly
made
to
the
general
assembly
of
north
carolina.
a
legislative
body
arched
to
a
court
or
any
court
of
law
where
an
attack
was
being
made
upon
such
conditions.
if
such
conditions
actually
exists.
i
would
be
remiss
i
think
since
the
brief
is
on
record
and
then
filed
in
this
court,
the
highest
court
of
our
land.
if
i
did
not
state
to
the
court
that
while
our
juvenile
correctional
institutions
are
not
all
that
they
ought
to
be
they’re
not
all
that
we
hope
that
they
will
be.
i
do
believe
that
they
offered
to
the
boys
and
girls
who
they
are
substantial
and
meaningful
opportunities
for
education,
vocational
treatment
and
for
correction.
there
are
no
fences
around
any
of
these
institutions
with
the
exception
of
the
dillon
school
where
there
are
113
of
the
most
aggressive
and
incorrigible
juveniles.
mr.
robert
morgan
on
tuesday
night
was
when
i
received
it,
your
honor.
the
night
before
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
it
was
just
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir
but
we
did
not
receive
it
until
tuesday
night.
now,
in
every
one
of
the
juvenile
correctional
institutions,
there
are
public
schools.
every
teacher
in
these
schools
holds
an
a
certificate,
a
higher
certificate
issued
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
except
graduate
students
and
graduate
certificates
and
many
of
the
teachers
many
of
them
hold
graduates
certificates.
driver’s
education
is
taught
in
this
institutions
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
furnishes
automobiles
for
the
youngsters
to
drive
while
they
are
in
such
training.
there
are
gymnasiums
at
every
institution
and
athletics
as
a
part
of
the
regular
curriculum.
four
of
them
have
swimming
pools,
some
of
camping
programs
are
carried
out
using
the
regular
for
each
club
camping
facilities
in
north
carolina
which
are
made
available
to
them
just
as
they
are
made
available
to
other
boys
and
girls
across
north
carolina.
tickets
are
regularly
reserved
at
the
big
four
football
games
in
the
area
and
at
other
college
football
games
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
the
areas
where
these
schools
are
located
as
well
as
basketball
games
and
some
scholastic
events.
tickets
are
reserved
for
them
concerts
in
the
area
and
especially
at
the
very
well-known
friends
of
the
college
concerts
which
take
place
at
north
carolina
state
university.
remedial
reading
is
taught,
other
remedial
courses
are
taught
there.
and
it
maybe
true
that
all
of
the
buildings
are
not
all
that
they
should
be,
but
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
i
attended
school
in
a
wooden
frame
building
with
an
old
pop-bellied
stove
and
i
am
not
--
i
don’t
believe
that
it
did
me
a
great
deal
of
harm.
and
i
speak
mr.
chief
justice
with
some
degree
of
personal
experience
and
knowledge
for
in
the
1950’s
i
served
as
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
of
my
county
and
i
visited
every
single
one
of
these
institutions
with
the
exception
of
the
two
that
have
been
constructed
most
recently.
my
wife
presently
is
serving
as
chairman
of
a
state
committee
to
raise
funds
to
build
a
chapel
at
the
doug
school
and
on
each
sunday
afternoon
that
the
committee
has
met
there,
my
eight-year-old
girl
and
my
nine-year-old
girl
have
accompanied
her
and
they
played
on
the
grounds
with
the
children
and
have
eaten
in
the
dining
halls
with
the
children
while
she
was
at
the
meeting.
so
i
believe,
if
it
pleases
the
court
that
if
the
conditions
at
these
institutions
had
been
as
described
in
the
reply
brief
that
i
would
have
been
in
some
--
in
a
position
to
know
something
about
them
and
submit
to
you
that
they
are
not,
they
are
in
corrective
in
nature
and
are
designed
to
rehabilitate
and
to
offer
vocational
training
and
education
for
these
boys
and
girls.
mr.
robert
morgan
there
are
no
findings,
your
honor
and
none
of
the
information
contained
in
the
reply
brief
which
attacks
a
condition
are
in
the
record
and
i
note
that
in
a
fifth
circuit
case
mitchell
versus
trade
winds
company,
289,
federal
second
278.
the
court
ordered
such
information
in
a
brief
stricken
saying
that
we
know
have
no
basis
on
which
it
would
be
legally
admissible
for
such
to
be
injected
into
litigation
at
the
appellant
level
is
such
were
relevant
to
the
issue
being
tried
in
the
district
court
it
should
have
been
tendered
in
the
usual
way.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
would
have
no
real
effect
because
if
it
were
true,
the
same
conditions
and
the
same
circumstances
would
apply
to
a
youngster
who
was
convicted
by
jury
as
one
who
was
convicted
by
judge
sitting
alone.
i
think
the
purpose
of
it
being
submitted
was
to
indicate
to
this
court
that
we
treat
youngsters
or
juveniles
as
criminals
and
therefore
that
the
entire
criminal
procedure,
all
criminal
safeguards
and
procedure
should
be
provided.
and
now
may
it
please
the
court
with
that
brief
statement.
i’d
like
to
return
to
what
i
considered
to
be
the
relevant
issue
and
the
facts
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
one
issue.
does
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
require
a
jury
trial
for
juvenile
charge
with
delinquency?
this
is
a
question
of
nationwide
import,
i
think
that
it’s
important
to
the
state
of
maryland
for
instance
--
the
state
from
which
the
johnson
case
arises
at
its
own
docket
now.
it’s
important
to
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
congress
has
just
recently
taken
and
removed
the
right
of
jury
trial.
it’s
important
and
while
it
is
important
to
my
state
and
especially
to
my
state
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
constitutional
principle.
i
am
frank
to
admit
to
this
court
that
i
do
not
think
that
jury
trials
would
impose
any
undue
hardship
on
my
state
except
perhaps
in
the
four
or
five
more
larger
metropolitan
areas
such
as
charlotte,
raleigh
and
greensboro
where
the
court
dockets
are
already
crowded
and
where
delay
of
as
much
as
two
years
is
not
at
all
unusual.
and
i
might
add
there
are
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
and
mr.
chief
justice
there
are
no
provisions
in
our
law
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
courts.
therefore,
if
this
court
should
order
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
then
they
would
have
to
be
in
necessity
transferred
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes
sir
that
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
i
think
your
honor
that
if
such
were
to
be
true
while
the
general
court
of
general
jurisdiction
would
probably
have
to
conduct
a
trial
because
that’s
what
we
have
jury
trial.
i
think
the
same
safeguards
and
procedure
safeguards
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
the
gault,
in
kent
and
winship
case
and
which
are
spelled
out
in
our
statute
would
apply.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
that’s
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
morgan
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
your
honor,
but
we
just
recently
adopted
a
new
constitution
which
requires
all
judges
to
be
lawyers.
however,
it
does
not
apply
it
has
a
grandfather
clause
as
far
as
those
who
are
presently
sitting.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
they
exercise
general
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
misdemeanors
and
civil
jurisdiction
up
in
matters
involving
$5,000.00
or
less.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
white,
within
the
last
decade,
we
brought
about
in
north
carolina
a
complete
revision
of
our
criminal
justice
system.
a
district
court
judge
is
elected
usually
from
two
or
three
counties
and
he
is
generally
well-qualified.
most
of
them
are
lawyers,
one
is
designated
as
a
chief
judge
and
he
designates
a
particular
judge
generally
to
set
as
juvenile
court
judge
and
family
judge.
now
this
is
not
always
true
because
you
may
have
one
particular
district
where
you
may
only
have
one
or
two
judges.
but
generally,
you
do
have
one
designated
specifically
for
this
purpose.
well,
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
proper
question
for
this
court
to
consider
and
i
think
one
that
should
be
resolved.
after
research
and
study
in
this
case,
i
am
satisfied
that
if
jury
trials
are
to
be
afforded
to
juveniles
that
it
should
be
done
by
the
legislative
bodies
and
not
be
required
by
this
court
under
constitutional
provisions.
i
personally
favor
jury
trial,
i
was
a
defense
attorney
for
15
years
and
in
almost
every
criminal
case
after
being
an
employed
i
would
automatically
to
request
the
jury
trial.
i
didn’t
always
insist
on
it
quite
frequently.
i
must
state
that
i
used
it
for
the
purpose
of
plea
bargaining
and
i'm
afraid
that
if
juvenile
courts
are
allowed
to
have
jury
trials
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
same
thing
will
be
true
here.
and
this
court
has
already
said
in
the
three
cases
--
mr.
robert
morgan
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
like
to
think
i
was
fairly
successful.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
morgan
most
of
them
were
jury.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
white,
as
a
defense
attorney
of
course
i
normally
prefer
the
jury.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
think
frankly
because
my
chances
of
getting
an
acquittal
were
greater.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
felt
that
i
could
be
more
persuasive
with
12
men
than
i
could
with
one.
i’m
being
quite
candid
with
this
court
as
defense
attorney.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
that's
my
understanding
now.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
the
course
that
that
so
far
in
the
kent
case
and
the
gault
case
and
the
winship
case
that
all
other
practically
all
other
procedural
safeguards
which
are
afforded
to
a
criminal
law
or
a
person
to
charged
to
commit
in
a
crime
are
afforded
to
a
juvenile
with
the
exception
of
jury
trials
and
of
course
public
hearings
which
would
be
required
by
the
sixth
amendment.
i'm
afraid
that
if
jury
trials
are
afforded
to
juveniles
that
many
of
the
advantages
of
the
juvenile
court
system
would
have
been
destroyed.
i
think
for
instance
the
question
of
public
trial
were
all
practical
purpose,
it
would
have
been
destroyed.
while
it
still
would
be
possible
to
exclude
the
public,
you
still
have
12
jurors
and
then
the
course
of
selecting
those
12
jurors
you
probably
have
subjected
many
other
perspective
jurors
to
question
on
their
voir
dire.
so,
i
think
for
that
purpose,
it
would
practically
destroy
that
effectiveness.
now
--
mr.
robert
morgan
no
sir,
they
are
not.
now
they
do
--
they
are
i
think
i
should
correct
that
they
are
permitted
to
print
the
detail
but
not
the
names.
and
i
believe
in
north
carolina
that
the
confidentiality
of
the
records
of
juvenile
courts
is
more
of
reality
than
rhetoric
because
the
juvenile
court
records
are
confidential
except
to
the
juvenile
himself
and
to
his
parents
and
the
court
can
permit.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
they
are
not
available
to
the
military
and
so
i
believe
that
while
in
occasion
if
a
juvenile
and
a
particular
community
should
commit
a
crime
while
of
course
most
people
in
the
community
know
that
these
youngsters
involved
with
some
delinquency
proceedings
but
it’s
not
widespread.
it’s
not
known.
it’s
not
disseminated
across
the
state
and
across
the
nation.
and
i
do
think
that
this
is
important.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
think
that
this
still
would
impede
the
administration
of
justice
because
i
think
eventually
we
would
see
that
jury
trials
are
continually
requested
for
instance
in
end
of
march
1970,
there
were
288
juveniles
waiting
for
a
jury
trial
here
in
this
area.
mr.
justice
marshall,
there’s
one
other
question
that
deserves
consideration
by
this
court
in
that
connection.
the
north
carolina
constitution
does
not
permit
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
of
the
person
charged
with
a
crime
and
just
what
effect
a
decision
on
this
court
--
of
this
court
requiring
a
jury
trial
would
have
on
that
provision
is
problematical
but
there
have
been
several
attempts
through
the
years
made
to
permit
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
and
it
is
always
been
defeated.
the
only
time
that
the
jury
trial
can
be
waived
is
by
person
charged
with
a
petty
offense.
i
noticed
that
my
time
is
about
up,
i
would
like
to
mention
two
points
which
i
think
are
crucial.
the
petitioners
contend
in
their
brief
that
judges
are
likely
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
say
to
this
court
that
in
their
own
brief
on
page
30,
in
footnote
30
that
they
made
the
strongest
argument
against
that
statement.
on
that
footnote,
they
give
the
statistics
for
instance
they
say
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
1968,
there
were
only
32
requests
for
jury
trials
out
of
3,196
less
than
one
percent.
in
1969,
there
were
only
28
out
of
2,863
again
less
than
one
percent.
they
give
the
figures
for
denver
in
which
they
say
in
1969
there
were
1,892
delinquency
petitions
and
13
resulted
in
jury
trial
less
than
one
percent.
and
i
believe
this
is
the
strongest
argument
against
their
statement
that
judges
acting
alone
or
like
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
now,
one
other
point
i’d
like
to
mention
that
there
is
no
contention
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
if
the
judge
was
partial
or
that
he
was
unfair
or
that
he
discriminated
in
anyway,
there
is
no
contention
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
find
the
adjudication
and
by
--
make
the
adjudication
by
the
evidence
and
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
law
in
north
carolina
requires
that
the
judge
make
a
finding
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
in
writing
and
this
can
be
appealed
to
the
appellate
courts
and
if
there's
an
insufficiency
of
evidence
to
support
it
then
the
appellate
courts
can
either
reverse
or
acquittal.
and
one
possible
danger
i’d
see
and
i’d
like
to
mention
to
this
court
in
closing
is
that
shortly
after
the
--
an
adjudication
that
by
the
courts
that
a
person
charged
with
crime
carrying
a
possible
punishment
of
more
than
six
months
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
the
north
carolina
legislates
out
of
necessity
reduce
the
maximum
penalty
for
driving
drunk
and
in
many
other
offenses.
in
order
to
get
around
this
provision
because
it
was
felt
that
it
would
so
bog
down
our
courts
that
justice
would
be
impeded.
and
i'm
afraid
that
if
such
were
to
happen
here
that
we
might
find
such
restrictions
placed
up
in
the
juvenile
courts
and
i
say
to
you
that
if
he
should
restrict
the
amount
of
time
that
a
juvenile
could
be
put
in
to
a
correctional
institution
to
six
months
you
could
not
give
him
any
meaning
for
training
or
vocational
training
or
education
and
that
then
it
might
very
well
become
six
months
of
punishment
rather
than
six
months
of
correction.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don’t
know.
i
would
say
this
that
the
meantime
that
the
juvenile
stays
in
our,
and
i
assume,
institutions
is
about
13
months.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
morgan
department
of
juvenile
correction.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
black,
he
can
be
restrained
of
his
liberties.
mr.
robert
morgan
he
can
be
confined,
but
we
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
but
he
is
not
confined
in
north
carolina
like
any
prison.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
he
is
sent
to
school
and
given
vocational
training
and
recreational
facilities
--
mr.
robert
morgan
we
are
hoping
to
do
that
your
honor,
but
it’s
going
to
take
years
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
and
i'm
robert
morgan
representing
the
state
of
north
carolina.
as
i
heard
the
arguments
of
the
petitioner
yesterday
and
as
i
study
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
i
find
that
one
threat
that
runs
throughout
the
briefs
and
throughout
the
arguments
is
the
contention
that
the
juvenile
correction
system
in
north
carolina
is
--
affords
no
treatment
different
from
that
which
criminals
would
receive.
now,
on
tuesday
night
when
i
arrived
in
the
office
of
mr.
scanlan
here
in
washington,
i
was
handed
a
copy
of
the
petitioner’s
reply
brief
for
the
first
time.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
other
briefs
in
this
case
had
been
on
file
for
several
months
and
i
find
it
somewhat
ironical
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
so
question
seems
to
be
a
--
the
question
a
one
of
procedural
due
process
where
the
petitioner’s
plead
in
their
brief
as
they
do
on
page
18
and
page
19
for
more
formality
in
the
courts
where
they
complained
that
the
courts
often
ignore
the
established
rules
of
evidence,
where
they
complain
that
the
judges
and
the
courts
are
often
subjected
to
inadmissible
evidence
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
should
submit
to
this
court
on
the
eleventh
power
a
brief
contained
what
i
believe
to
be
distorted,
misleading
and
actually
false
representations
of
the
north
carolina
juvenile
correctional
system.
they
cite
in
their
brief
and
the
so
citation
for
their
position.
a
purported
report
made
by
group
of
law
students
from
duke
university.
none
of
them
are
identified
by
name.
a
copy
of
their
poor
report
has
not
been
made
available
to
me
nor
has
it
been
published
or
distributed
to
my
knowledge.
a
telephone
call
to
the
north
carolina
director
of
juvenile
corrections,
he
informed
me
that
he
had
not
been
supplied
with
a
copy
of
that
brief.
now,
although
he
did
agree
that
back
in
the
summer
of
1969,
he
had
agreed
for
some
law
students
to
spend
a
week
in
each
one
of
the
correctional
institutions.
neither
today
has
not
been
time
for
me
to
refute
the
accusations
made
in
this
reply
brief,
but
nor
would
i
attempt
to
do
so
if
time
were
available
because
i
think
such
accusations
or
such
information
should
be
more
properly
made
to
the
general
assembly
of
north
carolina.
a
legislative
body
arched
to
a
court
or
any
court
of
law
where
an
attack
was
being
made
upon
such
conditions.
if
such
conditions
actually
exists.
i
would
be
remiss
i
think
since
the
brief
is
on
record
and
then
filed
in
this
court,
the
highest
court
of
our
land.
if
i
did
not
state
to
the
court
that
while
our
juvenile
correctional
institutions
are
not
all
that
they
ought
to
be
they’re
not
all
that
we
hope
that
they
will
be.
i
do
believe
that
they
offered
to
the
boys
and
girls
who
they
are
substantial
and
meaningful
opportunities
for
education,
vocational
treatment
and
for
correction.
there
are
no
fences
around
any
of
these
institutions
with
the
exception
of
the
dillon
school
where
there
are
113
of
the
most
aggressive
and
incorrigible
juveniles.
mr.
robert
morgan
on
tuesday
night
was
when
i
received
it,
your
honor.
the
night
before
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
it
was
just
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir
but
we
did
not
receive
it
until
tuesday
night.
now,
in
every
one
of
the
juvenile
correctional
institutions,
there
are
public
schools.
every
teacher
in
these
schools
holds
an
a
certificate,
a
higher
certificate
issued
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
except
graduate
students
and
graduate
certificates
and
many
of
the
teachers
many
of
them
hold
graduates
certificates.
driver’s
education
is
taught
in
this
institutions
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
furnishes
automobiles
for
the
youngsters
to
drive
while
they
are
in
such
training.
there
are
gymnasiums
at
every
institution
and
athletics
as
a
part
of
the
regular
curriculum.
four
of
them
have
swimming
pools,
some
of
camping
programs
are
carried
out
using
the
regular
for
each
club
camping
facilities
in
north
carolina
which
are
made
available
to
them
just
as
they
are
made
available
to
other
boys
and
girls
across
north
carolina.
tickets
are
regularly
reserved
at
the
big
four
football
games
in
the
area
and
at
other
college
football
games
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
the
areas
where
these
schools
are
located
as
well
as
basketball
games
and
some
scholastic
events.
tickets
are
reserved
for
them
concerts
in
the
area
and
especially
at
the
very
well-known
friends
of
the
college
concerts
which
take
place
at
north
carolina
state
university.
remedial
reading
is
taught,
other
remedial
courses
are
taught
there.
and
it
maybe
true
that
all
of
the
buildings
are
not
all
that
they
should
be,
but
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
i
attended
school
in
a
wooden
frame
building
with
an
old
pop-bellied
stove
and
i
am
not
--
i
don’t
believe
that
it
did
me
a
great
deal
of
harm.
and
i
speak
mr.
chief
justice
with
some
degree
of
personal
experience
and
knowledge
for
in
the
1950’s
i
served
as
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
of
my
county
and
i
visited
every
single
one
of
these
institutions
with
the
exception
of
the
two
that
have
been
constructed
most
recently.
my
wife
presently
is
serving
as
chairman
of
a
state
committee
to
raise
funds
to
build
a
chapel
at
the
doug
school
and
on
each
sunday
afternoon
that
the
committee
has
met
there,
my
eight-year-old
girl
and
my
nine-year-old
girl
have
accompanied
her
and
they
played
on
the
grounds
with
the
children
and
have
eaten
in
the
dining
halls
with
the
children
while
she
was
at
the
meeting.
so
i
believe,
if
it
pleases
the
court
that
if
the
conditions
at
these
institutions
had
been
as
described
in
the
reply
brief
that
i
would
have
been
in
some
--
in
a
position
to
know
something
about
them
and
submit
to
you
that
they
are
not,
they
are
in
corrective
in
nature
and
are
designed
to
rehabilitate
and
to
offer
vocational
training
and
education
for
these
boys
and
girls.
mr.
robert
morgan
there
are
no
findings,
your
honor
and
none
of
the
information
contained
in
the
reply
brief
which
attacks
a
condition
are
in
the
record
and
i
note
that
in
a
fifth
circuit
case
mitchell
versus
trade
winds
company,
289,
federal
second
278.
the
court
ordered
such
information
in
a
brief
stricken
saying
that
we
know
have
no
basis
on
which
it
would
be
legally
admissible
for
such
to
be
injected
into
litigation
at
the
appellant
level
is
such
were
relevant
to
the
issue
being
tried
in
the
district
court
it
should
have
been
tendered
in
the
usual
way.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
would
have
no
real
effect
because
if
it
were
true,
the
same
conditions
and
the
same
circumstances
would
apply
to
a
youngster
who
was
convicted
by
jury
as
one
who
was
convicted
by
judge
sitting
alone.
i
think
the
purpose
of
it
being
submitted
was
to
indicate
to
this
court
that
we
treat
youngsters
or
juveniles
as
criminals
and
therefore
that
the
entire
criminal
procedure,
all
criminal
safeguards
and
procedure
should
be
provided.
and
now
may
it
please
the
court
with
that
brief
statement.
i’d
like
to
return
to
what
i
considered
to
be
the
relevant
issue
and
the
facts
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
one
issue.
does
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
require
a
jury
trial
for
juvenile
charge
with
delinquency?
this
is
a
question
of
nationwide
import,
i
think
that
it’s
important
to
the
state
of
maryland
for
instance
--
the
state
from
which
the
johnson
case
arises
at
its
own
docket
now.
it’s
important
to
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
congress
has
just
recently
taken
and
removed
the
right
of
jury
trial.
it’s
important
and
while
it
is
important
to
my
state
and
especially
to
my
state
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
constitutional
principle.
i
am
frank
to
admit
to
this
court
that
i
do
not
think
that
jury
trials
would
impose
any
undue
hardship
on
my
state
except
perhaps
in
the
four
or
five
more
larger
metropolitan
areas
such
as
charlotte,
raleigh
and
greensboro
where
the
court
dockets
are
already
crowded
and
where
delay
of
as
much
as
two
years
is
not
at
all
unusual.
and
i
might
add
there
are
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
and
mr.
chief
justice
there
are
no
provisions
in
our
law
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
courts.
therefore,
if
this
court
should
order
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
then
they
would
have
to
be
in
necessity
transferred
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes
sir
that
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
i
think
your
honor
that
if
such
were
to
be
true
while
the
general
court
of
general
jurisdiction
would
probably
have
to
conduct
a
trial
because
that’s
what
we
have
jury
trial.
i
think
the
same
safeguards
and
procedure
safeguards
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
the
gault,
in
kent
and
winship
case
and
which
are
spelled
out
in
our
statute
would
apply.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
that’s
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
morgan
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
your
honor,
but
we
just
recently
adopted
a
new
constitution
which
requires
all
judges
to
be
lawyers.
however,
it
does
not
apply
it
has
a
grandfather
clause
as
far
as
those
who
are
presently
sitting.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
they
exercise
general
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
misdemeanors
and
civil
jurisdiction
up
in
matters
involving
$5,000.00
or
less.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
white,
within
the
last
decade,
we
brought
about
in
north
carolina
a
complete
revision
of
our
criminal
justice
system.
a
district
court
judge
is
elected
usually
from
two
or
three
counties
and
he
is
generally
well-qualified.
most
of
them
are
lawyers,
one
is
designated
as
a
chief
judge
and
he
designates
a
particular
judge
generally
to
set
as
juvenile
court
judge
and
family
judge.
now
this
is
not
always
true
because
you
may
have
one
particular
district
where
you
may
only
have
one
or
two
judges.
but
generally,
you
do
have
one
designated
specifically
for
this
purpose.
well,
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
proper
question
for
this
court
to
consider
and
i
think
one
that
should
be
resolved.
after
research
and
study
in
this
case,
i
am
satisfied
that
if
jury
trials
are
to
be
afforded
to
juveniles
that
it
should
be
done
by
the
legislative
bodies
and
not
be
required
by
this
court
under
constitutional
provisions.
i
personally
favor
jury
trial,
i
was
a
defense
attorney
for
15
years
and
in
almost
every
criminal
case
after
being
an
employed
i
would
automatically
to
request
the
jury
trial.
i
didn’t
always
insist
on
it
quite
frequently.
i
must
state
that
i
used
it
for
the
purpose
of
plea
bargaining
and
i'm
afraid
that
if
juvenile
courts
are
allowed
to
have
jury
trials
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
same
thing
will
be
true
here.
and
this
court
has
already
said
in
the
three
cases
--
mr.
robert
morgan
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
like
to
think
i
was
fairly
successful.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
morgan
most
of
them
were
jury.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
white,
as
a
defense
attorney
of
course
i
normally
prefer
the
jury.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
think
frankly
because
my
chances
of
getting
an
acquittal
were
greater.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
felt
that
i
could
be
more
persuasive
with
12
men
than
i
could
with
one.
i’m
being
quite
candid
with
this
court
as
defense
attorney.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
that's
my
understanding
now.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
the
course
that
that
so
far
in
the
kent
case
and
the
gault
case
and
the
winship
case
that
all
other
practically
all
other
procedural
safeguards
which
are
afforded
to
a
criminal
law
or
a
person
to
charged
to
commit
in
a
crime
are
afforded
to
a
juvenile
with
the
exception
of
jury
trials
and
of
course
public
hearings
which
would
be
required
by
the
sixth
amendment.
i'm
afraid
that
if
jury
trials
are
afforded
to
juveniles
that
many
of
the
advantages
of
the
juvenile
court
system
would
have
been
destroyed.
i
think
for
instance
the
question
of
public
trial
were
all
practical
purpose,
it
would
have
been
destroyed.
while
it
still
would
be
possible
to
exclude
the
public,
you
still
have
12
jurors
and
then
the
course
of
selecting
those
12
jurors
you
probably
have
subjected
many
other
perspective
jurors
to
question
on
their
voir
dire.
so,
i
think
for
that
purpose,
it
would
practically
destroy
that
effectiveness.
now
--
mr.
robert
morgan
no
sir,
they
are
not.
now
they
do
--
they
are
i
think
i
should
correct
that
they
are
permitted
to
print
the
detail
but
not
the
names.
and
i
believe
in
north
carolina
that
the
confidentiality
of
the
records
of
juvenile
courts
is
more
of
reality
than
rhetoric
because
the
juvenile
court
records
are
confidential
except
to
the
juvenile
himself
and
to
his
parents
and
the
court
can
permit.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
they
are
not
available
to
the
military
and
so
i
believe
that
while
in
occasion
if
a
juvenile
and
a
particular
community
should
commit
a
crime
while
of
course
most
people
in
the
community
know
that
these
youngsters
involved
with
some
delinquency
proceedings
but
it’s
not
widespread.
it’s
not
known.
it’s
not
disseminated
across
the
state
and
across
the
nation.
and
i
do
think
that
this
is
important.
mr.
robert
morgan
i
think
that
this
still
would
impede
the
administration
of
justice
because
i
think
eventually
we
would
see
that
jury
trials
are
continually
requested
for
instance
in
end
of
march
1970,
there
were
288
juveniles
waiting
for
a
jury
trial
here
in
this
area.
mr.
justice
marshall,
there’s
one
other
question
that
deserves
consideration
by
this
court
in
that
connection.
the
north
carolina
constitution
does
not
permit
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
of
the
person
charged
with
a
crime
and
just
what
effect
a
decision
on
this
court
--
of
this
court
requiring
a
jury
trial
would
have
on
that
provision
is
problematical
but
there
have
been
several
attempts
through
the
years
made
to
permit
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
and
it
is
always
been
defeated.
the
only
time
that
the
jury
trial
can
be
waived
is
by
person
charged
with
a
petty
offense.
i
noticed
that
my
time
is
about
up,
i
would
like
to
mention
two
points
which
i
think
are
crucial.
the
petitioners
contend
in
their
brief
that
judges
are
likely
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
say
to
this
court
that
in
their
own
brief
on
page
30,
in
footnote
30
that
they
made
the
strongest
argument
against
that
statement.
on
that
footnote,
they
give
the
statistics
for
instance
they
say
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
1968,
there
were
only
32
requests
for
jury
trials
out
of
3,196
less
than
one
percent.
in
1969,
there
were
only
28
out
of
2,863
again
less
than
one
percent.
they
give
the
figures
for
denver
in
which
they
say
in
1969
there
were
1,892
delinquency
petitions
and
13
resulted
in
jury
trial
less
than
one
percent.
and
i
believe
this
is
the
strongest
argument
against
their
statement
that
judges
acting
alone
or
like
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
now,
one
other
point
i’d
like
to
mention
that
there
is
no
contention
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
if
the
judge
was
partial
or
that
he
was
unfair
or
that
he
discriminated
in
anyway,
there
is
no
contention
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
find
the
adjudication
and
by
--
make
the
adjudication
by
the
evidence
and
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
law
in
north
carolina
requires
that
the
judge
make
a
finding
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
in
writing
and
this
can
be
appealed
to
the
appellate
courts
and
if
there's
an
insufficiency
of
evidence
to
support
it
then
the
appellate
courts
can
either
reverse
or
acquittal.
and
one
possible
danger
i’d
see
and
i’d
like
to
mention
to
this
court
in
closing
is
that
shortly
after
the
--
an
adjudication
that
by
the
courts
that
a
person
charged
with
crime
carrying
a
possible
punishment
of
more
than
six
months
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
the
north
carolina
legislates
out
of
necessity
reduce
the
maximum
penalty
for
driving
drunk
and
in
many
other
offenses.
in
order
to
get
around
this
provision
because
it
was
felt
that
it
would
so
bog
down
our
courts
that
justice
would
be
impeded.
and
i'm
afraid
that
if
such
were
to
happen
here
that
we
might
find
such
restrictions
placed
up
in
the
juvenile
courts
and
i
say
to
you
that
if
he
should
restrict
the
amount
of
time
that
a
juvenile
could
be
put
in
to
a
correctional
institution
to
six
months
you
could
not
give
him
any
meaning
for
training
or
vocational
training
or
education
and
that
then
it
might
very
well
become
six
months
of
punishment
rather
than
six
months
of
correction.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don’t
know.
i
would
say
this
that
the
meantime
that
the
juvenile
stays
in
our,
and
i
assume,
institutions
is
about
13
months.
thank
you.

robert
morgan
department
of

correction.
mr.
robert
morgan
mr.
justice
black,
he
can
be
restrained
of
his
liberties.
mr.
robert
morgan
he
can
be
confined,
but
we
--
mr.
robert
morgan
yes,
sir.
but
he
is
not
confined
in
north
carolina
like
any
prison.
mr.
robert
morgan
no,
sir.
he
is
sent
to
school
and
given
vocational
training
and
recreational
facilities
--
mr.
robert
morgan
we
are
hoping
to
do
that
your
honor,
but
it’s
going
to
take
years
to
do
it.
