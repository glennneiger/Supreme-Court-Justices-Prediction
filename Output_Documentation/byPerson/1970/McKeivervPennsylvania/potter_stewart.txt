justice
potter
stewart
mr.
meltsner,
are
you
urging
primarily
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
or
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
informed
by
because
i
heard
you
said
earlier
did
i
not,
you
felt
the
jury
trial
could
be
accorded
without
opening
the
courtroom
to
the
general
public?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
i
gather
it’s
more
nearly
a
due
process
than
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
they’ve
been
filed
here
december
2nd,
that’s
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
know
whether
in
england
which
is
the
birth
place
as
we
all
know
of
the
jury
system,
are
there
jury
trials
and
juvenile
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
this
matter
that
mr.
farmer
addressed
himself,
the
police
having
a
duplicate
set
of
records
which
in
any
event
are
released
and
so?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
farmer,
is
it
possible
for
the
juvenile
judge
to
find
that
the
young
man
or
woman
did
not
actually
do
this
act
on
which
he
is
now
being
charged
but
nonetheless
make
a
finding
that
the
young
person
is
a
delinquent?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
not
possible.
and
while
i’ve
interrupted
you,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
there
was
a
talk
in
previous
colloquy
about
a
plea
of
guilty,
are
there
formal
pleas
in
a
juvenile?
justice
potter
stewart
--
court?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
guilty
of
being
a
delinquent
or
guilty
of
yes
i
did
steal
the
money
but
nonetheless,
i
ask
you
not
to
find
me
a
delinquent?
