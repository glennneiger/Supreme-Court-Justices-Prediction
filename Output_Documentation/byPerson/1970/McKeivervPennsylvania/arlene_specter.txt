mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
starting
with
the
decisions
in
gault,
winship
and
duncan,
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
is
implicit
in
the
rationale
of
those
cases,
the
conclusion
that
jury
trials
are
not
required
for
juvenile
proceedings.
that
in
gault,
this
court
said
that
due
process
of
law
does
not
require
displacing
the
substantive
benefits
of
the
juvenile
court
process
and
this
court
further
said
that
the
features
of
the
juvenile
court
system
are
not
to
be
impaired
by
constitutional
domestication.
i
think
that
what
the
court
referred
to
as
it
amplified
its
opinion
and
rationale
in
gault
was
precisely
this
issue
which
is
here
today.
and
the
same
import
was
present
in
the
winship
opinion
with
the
language
that
there
was
to
be
no
effect
on
the
formality,
flexibility
or
speed
of
the
juvenile
court
process
and
as
the
juvenile
court
process
is
taken
up
and
come
to
groups
with,
it
is
precisely
those
factors
reserved
in
winship
which
militate
against
the
jury
trial.
the
same
thing
i
submit
to
your
honors
is
president
duncan,
one
of
the
footnotes,
there
is
a
reference
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
to
be
no
widespread
change
in
the
criminal
process
in
the
state
and
that
this
court
could
encompass
and
envision
an
entirely
fair
process
without
the
juries.
i
think
that
brings
us
right
to
the
central
question
which
is
presented
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
difference
would
be
if
there
is
a
jury
trial
i
suppose
to
a
bench
trial
in
the
juvenile
process
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
would
be
a
great
loss
in
the
intimacy
of
the
proceeding,
if
you
have
a
jury
trial.
yesterday,
the
question
was
raised
in
the
north
carolina
case
as
to
whether
the
matter
would
be
public.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
you
have
12
jurors
who
come
into
a
courtroom
to
try
the
issue
of
fact
that
he
would
have
more
public
participation
than
is
present
in
most
criminal
trials,
say
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
audience
is
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that
mr.
farmer
is
referring
basically
to
the
cases
where
juveniles
are
treated
as
adults.
we’ve
had
a
wave
of
gang
killings
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
where
there
is
a
determination
that
those
juveniles
should
be
tried
as
adults
because
we
think
the
consequences
should
be
long
term
confinement,
the
standard
approach
has
been
a
certification
to
an
adult
court.
the
police
--
mr.
arlene
specter
that
is
made
by
the
juvenile
judge,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
maybe
other
records
of
arrest
where
they
are
processed
initially
by
the
police
but
there
has
been
no
issue
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
raised
at
any
court
to
my
knowledge
that
the
police
are
making
any
improper
disclosure
of
any
juvenile
court
records.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
your
honor,
they
do
not
have
any
access
to
the
juvenile
court
records.
mr.
arlene
specter
that
is
correct.
the
police
records
do
not
contain
the
disposition
of
juvenile
cases.
in
fact,
the
police
records
customarily
don’t
even
contain
the
disposition
of
adult
records.
the
police
are
not
equipped
by
and
large
to
have
those
dispositions.
sometimes
they
do
or
don’t
in
adult
records
but
they
do
not
have
them
in
juvenile
record
cases
where
the
case
was
tried
to
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
your
honor
they
do.
when
they
take
a
juvenile
under
custody
they
do
have
a
record
of
that
but
they
do
not
--
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
it
is
not
a
public
record.
it
is
a
record
which
is
customarily
not
disclosed.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
they
would
not.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
they
would
not,
i
know
that
they
should
not.
i
would
not
represent
to
you
that
there
is
no
way
that
it
can't
be
found
out
but
i
think
the
standard
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
the
point
that
i
would
make
as
emphatically
as
i
can
that
in
philadelphia,
as
in
most
big
cities,
there’s
a
super
abundance
of
litigation
and
quite
properly
so
as
to
the
proper
role
of
the
police
and
the
proper
rights
of
juveniles
and
adults
as
well
and
there
has
been
no
question
raised
by
a
very
active
defenders
office,
community
legal
services
and
bar
association
about
any
improper
disclosure
by
police
of
juvenile
records
and
we
have
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that
they
do
not
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
again,
that
is
largely
a
negative
inference
on
my
part
because
no
one
has
challenged
it.
i
know
of
no
occasion
when
someone
has
complained
about
the
military
obtaining
a
record
and
i
know
of
no
such
request
and
i
think
it
would
be
the
procedure
of
our
juvenile
court
not
to
let
anybody
have
those
records
because
i
think
that
would
be
an
improper
disclosure
under
our
juvenile
court
law.
but
this
entire
area
of
disclosure
of
records
has
just
not
been
raised
or
litigated
on
the
philadelphia
scene
and
we
have
raised
and
litigated
virtually
every
--
many,
many
issues
involving
the
allegation
of
improper
police
conduct.
returning
if
i
may,
to
the
central
question
as
to
just
what
kind
of
a
trial
you
have
with
the
jury
as
contrasted
with
the
judge
alone,
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
would
be
at
least
four
factors
which
would
come
into
play
here.
as
i
would
characterize
them,
the
factor
of
intimacy,
the
father
figure,
the
general
flexibility
and
the
aspect
of
speed.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
intimacy
where
there
is
a
bench
trial
and
a
judge
dissents
and
the
juvenile
is
before
them,
there
is
a
straight
line
between
that
judge
and
that
juvenile
and
it
is
vastly
different
when
you
bring
a
jury
into
a
courtroom.
as
soon
as
the
jury
is
in
the
courtroom,
then
there
is
the
immediate
import
of
the
tactics
of
acquittal
and
quite
properly
so
under
our
judicial
system,
the
thrust
of
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
is
to
do
everything
he
can
to
secure
an
acquittal.
when
there
is
a
proceeding
before
a
judge
alone,
lawyers
respond
very
differently
and
so
do
those
who
are
there
to
be
adjudicated.
there
is
much
less
emphasis
upon
excluding
material
and
now
i’m
talking
about
material
which
may
properly
be
before
a
judge.
a
judge
has
much
wider
latitude
in
accepting
competent
evidence
that
may
go
before
a
jury
because
of
its
possibly
prejudicial
effect.
it
is
a
much
more
understandable
proceeding
for
a
juvenile
when
he
is
in
a
more
informal
circumstance.
i
think
that
it
is
a
consequence
even
for
a
lawyers
and
certainly
for
juveniles
and
certainly
for
other
defendants
that
when
a
jury
comes
into
a
box
and
sits
in
the
room,
there
is
an
immediate
electrifying
effect
in
terms
of
what
that
defendant
does
in
an
adult
trial.
in
terms
of
how
he
responds
if
there
is
an
occasion
noted,
the
side
bar
conference,
there
are
waives
that
go
before
--
between
a
defendant
in
an
adult
trial
and
a
jury
and
certainly,
it
is
a
very
formalizing
effect
to
have
that
jury
present
for
a
juvenile
to
know
that
those
men
are
to
judge
him
and
are
to
pass
upon
this
question
in
terms
of
his
very
basic
reaction.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
your
honor
i
would
not.
i
would
think
that
it
is
in
his
best
interest
that
he
not
be
tried
by
a
jury.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
there
--
mr.
arlene
specter
because
we
must
formulate
a
system
which
may
not
respond
to
his
personal
wishes
or
which
may
not
respond
to
his
personal
likelihood
of
beating
the
ramp
if
that
is
undesirable
for
him
as
an
individual
and
undesirable
for
society
as
a
general
rule?
mr.
arlene
specter
i
object
to
it
if
it
was
not
well
found
in,
if
there
was
no
evidence
behind
it.
mr.
arlene
specter
there
is
a
great
deal
that
has
to
be
ascertained
beyond
his
mere
decision
to
plead
guilty.
we
have
to
--
mr.
arlene
specter
we
have
the
possibility
of
advisory
juries
--
mr.
arlene
specter
--
but
that
is
discretionary
and
have
equity
trials
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
juvenile
would
get
less
under
that
system
and
i
would
move
ahead
to
part
of
my
duncan
argument
in
responding
directly
to
your
honor.
mr.
arlene
specter
that
a
juvenile
gets
more
under
the
current
juvenile
system
than
he
would
get
under
the
jury
determination
and
as
your
honor
formulated
that
question,
an
advisory
jury
to
make
a
determination
that
he
is
a
delinquent
and
that’s
the
critical
question,
not
did
he
commit
the
act
but
is
he
in
fact
delinquent,
and
under
the
current
juvenile
system,
a
juvenile
gets
more
because
he
is
not
subject
to
confinement
or
subject
to
training
or
subject
to
an
adjudication
as
a
delinquent
on
a
mere
finding
that
he
committed
a
specific
act.
every
adult
is,
that
is
an
adjudication
of
the
delinquency
but
the
juvenile
is
not.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
think
he
can
do
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
would
say
that
that
cannot
--
if
this
court
says
to
the
states
that
a
juvenile
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
a
determination
of
did
he
do
it
or
did
he
not
do
it,
that
you
cannot
then
separate
that
out
from
a
determination
as
to
whether
he’s
a
delinquent,
that’s
going
to
be
the
very
next
case
when
a
judge
makes
a
determination
that
he
is
a
delinquent
on
a
factual
finding
that
he
committed
the
act.
then
there’s
going
to
be
the
question,
oh
no,
that’s
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
a
question
for
a
jury.
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
let
the
judge
make
that
determination
and
then
we
become
involved
in
the
impossible
issue
of
charging
a
jury
on
what
the
factors
are
to
constitute
a
delinquent
status.
it
is
possible,
difficult
but
possible,
we’ve
done
if
for
centuries
to
charge
a
jury
as
to
making
a
factual
determination.
did
he
commit
the
larceny
or
did
he
not
commit
the
larceny.
but
as
soon
as
you
move
from
that
question
to
a
judgment,
did
he
in
fact
become
a
delinquent
as
a
result
of
this
complex
circumstances,
you
are
moving
away
from
what
a
judge
has
to
do
and
to
what
a
jury
has
to
do.
a
jury
returns
a
verdict.
mr.
arlene
specter
the
jury
finds
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
in
fact
--
mr.
arlene
specter
committed
the
larceny.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
if
you
are
to
accord
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i’m
sorry
i
didn’t
hear
you
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
i
think
that
you
can
fashion
the
system
to
try
to
give
the
juvenile,
a
benefit
of
the
verdict
and
then
to
try
to
preserve
something
for
the
judgment
of
delinquency
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
when
you
do
that,
you
make
it
infinitely
more
difficult
for
the
judge
then
to
say
in
the
face
of
that
verdict
that
this
juvenile
is
not
delinquent.
after
all,
in
the
fact
finding
process,
the
judge
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion
to
put
it
perhaps
overly
bluntly,
he
can
hide
behind
a
finding
that
there
is
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
can
base
his
decision
for
those
witnesses
who
have
been
there,
that
he
does
not
believe
or
tends
to
weigh
or
finds
on
burden
of
proof
that
the
act
was
not
committed.
so
that
when
he
makes
the
adjudication
that
the
juvenile
is
not
a
delinquent,
he
has
a
much
easier
time
doing
that
if
he
is
not
faced
with
a
verdict
from
a
jury
that
the
act
in
fact
was
committed.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
think
so
because
--
mr.
arlene
specter
the
judge
sits,
no
sir,
it
is
not.
the
judge
sits
and
he
makes
the
determination
as
to
what’s
happened
in
the
case
and
very
frequently,
he
will
make
an
adjudication
that
he
is
not
delinquent.
now,
he
does
not
put
on
the
record
or
does
not
articulate
or
speak
out
as
to
what
facts
he
has
found.
mr.
arlene
specter
he
should
not,
he
should
not
have
that
--
mr.
arlene
specter
--
report.
i
think
he
still
does
to
some
extent
because
we
are
still
learning
from
gault.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
--
that
the
juvenile
court
judge
can
properly
have
his
background
before
he
makes
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
i
think
that
--
mr.
arlene
specter
because,
the
issue
is
raised
at
that
stage
without
regard
to
his
prior
record.
i
think
that
the
judge
can
take
the
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
i
think
that
the
question
of
his
record
is
to
come
into
play
when
he
decides
what
the
disposition
is
to
be
and
i
don’t
think
he
can
have,
he
can
have
his
prior
record
before
him
when
he
makes
a
determination
of
delinquency.
i
think
that
is
going
too
far
at
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
he
must
find
the
underlying
prohibited
conduct
before
making
a
determination
of
delinquency,
the
judge
would
have
to
do
that.
mr.
arlene
specter
correct.
mr.
arlene
specter
indispensable
as
a
matter
of
fun
--
as
a
matter
of
the
gault
requirements
before
there
can
be
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
i
would
--
mr.
arlene
specter
precisely
mr.
justice
harlan,
for
a
wide
variety
of
reasons,
that
judge
can
believe
that
the
act
was
committed
but
can
conclude
that
the
interest
of
the
juvenile,
the
overall
interest
to
the
system.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that’s
the
critical
question,
that’s
the
broader
benefit
which
the
juvenile
gets
that
he
cannot
get
if
there
is
a
jury
present.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
mr.
justice
black,
i’d
say
precisely
that,
you
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere
and
that’s
the
line.
mr.
arlene
specter
if
i
might
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
there
are
enormous
numbers
of
–
varies
in
the
law
mr.
chief
justice
where
the
juvenile
gets
different
consideration,
different
treatment.
mr.
arlene
specter
then
he
gets
social
security
at
65.
there
are
many
differences
on
ages
in
our
entire
system
and
with
a
rational
basis
they
are
upheld.
everybody
is
not
treated
the
same,
you
must
have
a
cut
off
line
and
that
line
is
the
age.
mr.
arlene
specter
we’ll,
let
me
move
in
response
to
that
if
might,
skipping
parts
of
the
argument
because
of
the
time
problem
into
this
issue
of
promptness
which
i
submit
shows
that
the
juvenile
gets
a
much
better
treatment
the
way
the
court
systems
work
in
practical
consequences.
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
we
are
able
to
deal
with
our
juvenile
problems
in
a
much
better
manner
because
we
do
not
have
the
jury
trial
as
a
matter
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
contrasted
with
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
for
adults.
for
example,
in
the
first
10
months
of
1970,
we
have
tried
slightly
less
than
13000
adult
cases
contrasted
with
slightly
less
than
11000
juvenile
cases.
we
have
25
judges
on
an
average
trying
those
adult
cases.
we
have
five
judges
on
an
average
trying
those
juvenile
cases.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
does
and
i
think
it
does
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that
it
has
to
and
i
would
move
over
to
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
debacker
versus
brainard
when
he
pointed
out
that
the
juvenile
court
have
not
come
along
as
everyone
had
hoped
that
it
would
because
there
was
not
the
kind
of
a
municipal
budget
to
handle
the
problem.
and
i
think
that
when
you
evaluate
the
juvenile
system
and
say
that
it
is
a
horrendous
system
and
point
to
the
faults
of
it,
i
will
not
stand
here
and
say
that
it
is
a
perfect
system
but
i
will
say
that
if
you
compare
it
to
the
adult
system,
it
is
vastly
preferable.
i
will
not
argue
that
the
schools
are
models
for
juveniles.
in
pennsylvania,
although
i
think
it’s
irrelevant
to
this
in
any
event
but
they
are
vastly
superior
to
the
prisons
for
the
adults.
that
when
you
come
down
to
what
happens
as
you
dispose
in
a
big
city
like
philadelphia
of
11,000
juvenile
cases
and
13,000
adult
cases,
we
have
a
backlog
in
philadelphia
on
the
adults
of
almost
6,000
cases
contrasted
with
1,400
for
juveniles
where
we
are
current.
we
can
give
a
juvenile
and
adjudicatory
hearing
in
two
weeks
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
not
all
are
tried
at
the
first
listing
but
they’re
tried
promptly.
on
the
adult
side,
they
go
on
for
six
months,
12
months,
or
even
18
months.
we
have
in
confinement
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
today
on
the
adult
side
1,885
adults
awaiting
trial.
we
have
juveniles,
249
on
a
system
where
about
half
fit
in
as
adults
and
about
half
fit
in
as
juveniles,
so
that
the
practical
consequence
of
this
juvenile
system
is
that
you
get
the
juvenile
to
court
in
a
hurry
by
comparison
to
the
adults
and
if
there
is
any
juncture
where
rehabilitation
and
the
accurate
of
the
fact
of
a
prompt
trial,
never
mind
where
he
is
sentenced,
where
he’s
sent,
but
the
curative
effect
of
a
prompt
trial,
it
is
certainly
in
the
formative
stage
of
a
young
man's
life,
15
or
16
where
its
done
very
promptly,
much
more
important
to
give
him
that
kind
of
immediate
hearing
and
immediate
determination
than
it
is
someone
who
is
much
older.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
i
do
not
believe,
it
would
be
appropriate
under
our
constitutional
form
of
government
to
make
any
shift
from
the
traditions
on
adult
trials,
i
think
that
they
are
arms
length
proceedings,
it
is
deeply
ingrained
in
our
system
and
i
think
an
adult
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
i
think
that
one
day
they
will
presented
to
this
court
the
conflict
on
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
with
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
here
this
morning
that
the
establishment
of
priorities
is
a
matter
which
must
affect
all
deliberative
bodies.
it
would
be
preferable
to
keep
out
the
question
of
priorities
in
the
determination
of
constitutional
issues
but
it
is
something
which
is
just
implicit.
we
have
in
our
system
today
a
juvenile
court
responding
to
an
inquiry
made
earlier
by
chief
justice
as
to
our
new
system.
our
juvenile
court
now
is
a
part
of
our
overall
court
system.
if
we
have
jury
trials
in
the
juvenile
courts,
there
must
be
necessarily
a
movement
of
judges
from
the
adult
courts
into
the
juvenile
courts
so
that
the
system
will
become
more
aggravated.
we
have
been
attempting
in
philadelphia
for
the
last
four
years
to
get
30
additional
judges
for
the
city
of
philadelphia
urgently
needed.
and
because
of
state
financial
problems,
we
cannot
get
those
judges
for
the
city
of
philadelphia.
this
maybe
irrelevant
in
terms
of
the
theory
of
constitutional
law
but
it’s
a
very
major
practicality.
we
have
in
pennsylvania
today
a
mandamus
action
brought
by
the
philadelphia
city
courts
against
the
philadelphia
city
council,
to
compel
the
council
to
put
up
$4,000,000.00
to
run
the
courts
and
we
have
gotten
the
judgment
in
the
lower
court
and
it
is
now
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
and
there
is
a
ticklish
issue
of
division
of
responsibility
as
to
whether
the
courts
can
compel
a
legislative
body
that
provide
more
judges
and
necessarily
to
increase
taxes,
but
that
is
where
we
are
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
and
if
we
have
the
necessity
for
juvenile
jury
trial,
i’m
not
going
to
say
to
you
that
its
going
to
overwhelm
our
system
because
that
might
be
placing
the
issue
of
finance
is
too
high
but
i
will
say
to
you
is
that
it
will
leave
the
juvenile
in
much
worst
shape
than
he
is
today
because
when
there
is
an
opportunity
for
a
jury
trial,
it
becomes
to
a
large
extent
a
device
for
delay
which
is
used
with
total
propriety
by
a
defense
lawyer
to
get
the
case
continue.
we
have
a
practice
in
pennsylvania
of
having
the
waiver
signed
at
the
time
of
trial,
must
be
signed
by
the
trial
judge
before
whom
the
case
goes.
we
could
not
under
our
practice
have
a
waiver
in
advance,
and
the
question
is
to
whether
the
case
will
be
bench
trial
or
jury
trial
is
determined
when
the
defendant
is
called
before
that
specific
judge
and
the
decision
is
made
as
to
whether
the
defendant
can
get
is
more
likely
to
be
acquitted
by
that
judge.
we
have
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
along
the
13,000
cases
we’ve
tried
this
year,
only
226
jury
trials,
less
than
2%
of
our
cases
in
adult
court
are
tried
to
a
jury.
it
is
estimated
that
between
30%
to
50%
of
the
cases
there
is
a
demand
for
a
jury
trial
and
it
is
made
as
a
tactical
device
and
no
one
and
i
do
not
now
quarrel
with
that
tactical
device.
but
if
it
is
present
in
the
juvenile
system,
it
will
necessarily
i
submit
to
your
honor
result
in
great
delay.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
black,
--
mr.
arlene
specter
226
jury
trials
--
mr.
arlene
specter
--
adult
court
out
of
almost
13000,
less
than
2%.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
i
would
--
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
i
would
predict
there
would
be
very
few
jury
trials
but
its
present
would
be
a
great
delay
because
when
a
case
is
called,
it
would
be
continued
because
there
is
not
a
jury
available.
when
a
judge
has
a
list
of
say
20
cases,
we
have
them
in
our
philadelphia
adult
courts.
the
judge
may
dispose
of
12
cases
on
that
list
if
he
tries
them
on
a
bench
trial.
if
the
jury
demand
is
made,
that
case
is
put
over,
its
put
over
and
its
put
over
and
its
over
until
its
continued
6,
8,
10,
20
times,
so
that
the
opportunity
for
demand
will
result
in
great
delay.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
say
that.
i
think
that
our
traditions
are
too
firm
in
terms
of
according
an
adult
criminal
defendant
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes,
i
do.
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
important
enough
and
i
think
that
the
distinctions
between
the
adults
and
the
juveniles
for
the
other
reasons
that
i
have
given
justify
the
difference
in
treatment
between
adults
and
juveniles
in
terms
of
our
entire
tradition,
and
i
would
close
on
just
that
note.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
black,
had
i
selected
my
words
with
perhaps
more
amplification,
i
would
have
rested
it
on
the
constitution,
i
think
it
is
in
the
constitution
because
if
it
is
in
our
tradition
and
i
think
our
constitution
has
embodied
the
tradition
of
our
concepts
of
fundamental
fairness
and
justice.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
i
do,
i
do,
but
i
think
necessarily
that
when
there
is
an
extension
of
constitutional
right,
as
the
constitution
is
interpreted
differently
in
different
eras
of
that,
there
is
a
necessary
balancing
process
that
this
court
must
undertake
and
that
it
necessarily
involves
the
issues
of
priorities
and
i
would
put
it
in
terms
of
the
juvenile
being
treated
worst
under
a
modified
system
as
opposed
to
the
present
system.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
starting
with
the
decisions
in
gault,
winship
and
duncan,
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
is
implicit
in
the
rationale
of
those
cases,
the
conclusion
that
jury
trials
are
not
required
for
juvenile
proceedings.
that
in
gault,
this
court
said
that
due
process
of
law
does
not
require
displacing
the
substantive
benefits
of
the
juvenile
court
process
and
this
court
further
said
that
the
features
of
the
juvenile
court
system
are
not
to
be
impaired
by
constitutional
domestication.
i
think
that
what
the
court
referred
to
as
it
amplified
its
opinion
and
rationale
in
gault
was
precisely
this
issue
which
is
here
today.
and
the
same
import
was
present
in
the
winship
opinion
with
the
language
that
there
was
to
be
no
effect
on
the
formality,
flexibility
or
speed
of
the
juvenile
court
process
and
as
the
juvenile
court
process
is
taken
up
and
come
to
groups
with,
it
is
precisely
those
factors
reserved
in
winship
which
militate
against
the
jury
trial.
the
same
thing
i
submit
to
your
honors
is
president
duncan,
one
of
the
footnotes,
there
is
a
reference
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
to
be
no
widespread
change
in
the
criminal
process
in
the
state
and
that
this
court
could
encompass
and
envision
an
entirely
fair
process
without
the
juries.
i
think
that
brings
us
right
to
the
central
question
which
is
presented
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
difference
would
be
if
there
is
a
jury
trial
i
suppose
to
a
bench
trial
in
the
juvenile
process
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
would
be
a
great
loss
in
the
intimacy
of
the
proceeding,
if
you
have
a
jury
trial.
yesterday,
the
question
was
raised
in
the
north
carolina
case
as
to
whether
the
matter
would
be
public.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
you
have
12
jurors
who
come
into
a
courtroom
to
try
the
issue
of
fact
that
he
would
have
more
public
participation
than
is
present
in
most
criminal
trials,
say
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
audience
is
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that
mr.
farmer
is
referring
basically
to
the
cases
where
juveniles
are
treated
as
adults.
we’ve
had
a
wave
of
gang
killings
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
where
there
is
a
determination
that
those
juveniles
should
be
tried
as
adults
because
we
think
the
consequences
should
be
long
term
confinement,
the
standard
approach
has
been
a
certification
to
an
adult
court.
the
police
--
mr.
arlene
specter
that
is
made
by
the
juvenile
judge,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
maybe
other
records
of
arrest
where
they
are
processed
initially
by
the
police
but
there
has
been
no
issue
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
raised
at
any
court
to
my
knowledge
that
the
police
are
making
any
improper
disclosure
of
any
juvenile
court
records.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
your
honor,
they
do
not
have
any
access
to
the
juvenile
court
records.
mr.
arlene
specter
that
is
correct.
the
police
records
do
not
contain
the
disposition
of
juvenile
cases.
in
fact,
the
police
records
customarily
don’t
even
contain
the
disposition
of
adult
records.
the
police
are
not
equipped
by
and
large
to
have
those
dispositions.
sometimes
they
do
or
don’t
in
adult
records
but
they
do
not
have
them
in
juvenile
record
cases
where
the
case
was
tried
to
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
your
honor
they
do.
when
they
take
a
juvenile
under
custody
they
do
have
a
record
of
that
but
they
do
not
--
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
it
is
not
a
public
record.
it
is
a
record
which
is
customarily
not
disclosed.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
they
would
not.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
they
would
not,
i
know
that
they
should
not.
i
would
not
represent
to
you
that
there
is
no
way
that
it
can't
be
found
out
but
i
think
the
standard
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
the
point
that
i
would
make
as
emphatically
as
i
can
that
in
philadelphia,
as
in
most
big
cities,
there’s
a
super
abundance
of
litigation
and
quite
properly
so
as
to
the
proper
role
of
the
police
and
the
proper
rights
of
juveniles
and
adults
as
well
and
there
has
been
no
question
raised
by
a
very
active
defenders
office,
community
legal
services
and
bar
association
about
any
improper
disclosure
by
police
of
juvenile
records
and
we
have
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that
they
do
not
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
again,
that
is
largely
a
negative
inference
on
my
part
because
no
one
has
challenged
it.
i
know
of
no
occasion
when
someone
has
complained
about
the
military
obtaining
a
record
and
i
know
of
no
such
request
and
i
think
it
would
be
the
procedure
of
our
juvenile
court
not
to
let
anybody
have
those
records
because
i
think
that
would
be
an
improper
disclosure
under
our
juvenile
court
law.
but
this
entire
area
of
disclosure
of
records
has
just
not
been
raised
or
litigated
on
the
philadelphia
scene
and
we
have
raised
and
litigated
virtually
every
--
many,
many
issues
involving
the
allegation
of
improper
police
conduct.
returning
if
i
may,
to
the
central
question
as
to
just
what
kind
of
a
trial
you
have
with
the
jury
as
contrasted
with
the
judge
alone,
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
would
be
at
least
four
factors
which
would
come
into
play
here.
as
i
would
characterize
them,
the
factor
of
intimacy,
the
father
figure,
the
general
flexibility
and
the
aspect
of
speed.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
intimacy
where
there
is
a
bench
trial
and
a
judge
dissents
and
the
juvenile
is
before
them,
there
is
a
straight
line
between
that
judge
and
that
juvenile
and
it
is
vastly
different
when
you
bring
a
jury
into
a
courtroom.
as
soon
as
the
jury
is
in
the
courtroom,
then
there
is
the
immediate
import
of
the
tactics
of
acquittal
and
quite
properly
so
under
our
judicial
system,
the
thrust
of
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
is
to
do
everything
he
can
to
secure
an
acquittal.
when
there
is
a
proceeding
before
a
judge
alone,
lawyers
respond
very
differently
and
so
do
those
who
are
there
to
be
adjudicated.
there
is
much
less
emphasis
upon
excluding
material
and
now
i’m
talking
about
material
which
may
properly
be
before
a
judge.
a
judge
has
much
wider
latitude
in
accepting
competent
evidence
that
may
go
before
a
jury
because
of
its
possibly
prejudicial
effect.
it
is
a
much
more
understandable
proceeding
for
a
juvenile
when
he
is
in
a
more
informal
circumstance.
i
think
that
it
is
a
consequence
even
for
a
lawyers
and
certainly
for
juveniles
and
certainly
for
other
defendants
that
when
a
jury
comes
into
a
box
and
sits
in
the
room,
there
is
an
immediate
electrifying
effect
in
terms
of
what
that
defendant
does
in
an
adult
trial.
in
terms
of
how
he
responds
if
there
is
an
occasion
noted,
the
side
bar
conference,
there
are
waives
that
go
before
--
between
a
defendant
in
an
adult
trial
and
a
jury
and
certainly,
it
is
a
very
formalizing
effect
to
have
that
jury
present
for
a
juvenile
to
know
that
those
men
are
to
judge
him
and
are
to
pass
upon
this
question
in
terms
of
his
very
basic
reaction.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
your
honor
i
would
not.
i
would
think
that
it
is
in
his
best
interest
that
he
not
be
tried
by
a
jury.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
there
--
mr.
arlene
specter
because
we
must
formulate
a
system
which
may
not
respond
to
his
personal
wishes
or
which
may
not
respond
to
his
personal
likelihood
of
beating
the
ramp
if
that
is
undesirable
for
him
as
an
individual
and
undesirable
for
society
as
a
general
rule?
mr.
arlene
specter
i
object
to
it
if
it
was
not
well
found
in,
if
there
was
no
evidence
behind
it.
mr.
arlene
specter
there
is
a
great
deal
that
has
to
be
ascertained
beyond
his
mere
decision
to
plead
guilty.
we
have
to
--
mr.
arlene
specter
we
have
the
possibility
of
advisory
juries
--
mr.
arlene
specter
--
but
that
is
discretionary
and
have
equity
trials
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
juvenile
would
get
less
under
that
system
and
i
would
move
ahead
to
part
of
my
duncan
argument
in
responding
directly
to
your
honor.
mr.
arlene
specter
that
a
juvenile
gets
more
under
the
current
juvenile
system
than
he
would
get
under
the
jury
determination
and
as
your
honor
formulated
that
question,
an
advisory
jury
to
make
a
determination
that
he
is
a
delinquent
and
that’s
the
critical
question,
not
did
he
commit
the
act
but
is
he
in
fact
delinquent,
and
under
the
current
juvenile
system,
a
juvenile
gets
more
because
he
is
not
subject
to
confinement
or
subject
to
training
or
subject
to
an
adjudication
as
a
delinquent
on
a
mere
finding
that
he
committed
a
specific
act.
every
adult
is,
that
is
an
adjudication
of
the
delinquency
but
the
juvenile
is
not.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
think
he
can
do
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
would
say
that
that
cannot
--
if
this
court
says
to
the
states
that
a
juvenile
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
a
determination
of
did
he
do
it
or
did
he
not
do
it,
that
you
cannot
then
separate
that
out
from
a
determination
as
to
whether
he’s
a
delinquent,
that’s
going
to
be
the
very
next
case
when
a
judge
makes
a
determination
that
he
is
a
delinquent
on
a
factual
finding
that
he
committed
the
act.
then
there’s
going
to
be
the
question,
oh
no,
that’s
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
a
question
for
a
jury.
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
let
the
judge
make
that
determination
and
then
we
become
involved
in
the
impossible
issue
of
charging
a
jury
on
what
the
factors
are
to
constitute
a
delinquent
status.
it
is
possible,
difficult
but
possible,
we’ve
done
if
for
centuries
to
charge
a
jury
as
to
making
a
factual
determination.
did
he
commit
the
larceny
or
did
he
not
commit
the
larceny.
but
as
soon
as
you
move
from
that
question
to
a
judgment,
did
he
in
fact
become
a
delinquent
as
a
result
of
this
complex
circumstances,
you
are
moving
away
from
what
a
judge
has
to
do
and
to
what
a
jury
has
to
do.
a
jury
returns
a
verdict.
mr.
arlene
specter
the
jury
finds
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
in
fact
--
mr.
arlene
specter
committed
the
larceny.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
if
you
are
to
accord
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i’m
sorry
i
didn’t
hear
you
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
i
think
that
you
can
fashion
the
system
to
try
to
give
the
juvenile,
a
benefit
of
the
verdict
and
then
to
try
to
preserve
something
for
the
judgment
of
delinquency
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
when
you
do
that,
you
make
it
infinitely
more
difficult
for
the
judge
then
to
say
in
the
face
of
that
verdict
that
this
juvenile
is
not
delinquent.
after
all,
in
the
fact
finding
process,
the
judge
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion
to
put
it
perhaps
overly
bluntly,
he
can
hide
behind
a
finding
that
there
is
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
can
base
his
decision
for
those
witnesses
who
have
been
there,
that
he
does
not
believe
or
tends
to
weigh
or
finds
on
burden
of
proof
that
the
act
was
not
committed.
so
that
when
he
makes
the
adjudication
that
the
juvenile
is
not
a
delinquent,
he
has
a
much
easier
time
doing
that
if
he
is
not
faced
with
a
verdict
from
a
jury
that
the
act
in
fact
was
committed.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
think
so
because
--
mr.
arlene
specter
the
judge
sits,
no
sir,
it
is
not.
the
judge
sits
and
he
makes
the
determination
as
to
what’s
happened
in
the
case
and
very
frequently,
he
will
make
an
adjudication
that
he
is
not
delinquent.
now,
he
does
not
put
on
the
record
or
does
not
articulate
or
speak
out
as
to
what
facts
he
has
found.
mr.
arlene
specter
he
should
not,
he
should
not
have
that
--
mr.
arlene
specter
--
report.
i
think
he
still
does
to
some
extent
because
we
are
still
learning
from
gault.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
--
that
the
juvenile
court
judge
can
properly
have
his
background
before
he
makes
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
i
think
that
--
mr.
arlene
specter
because,
the
issue
is
raised
at
that
stage
without
regard
to
his
prior
record.
i
think
that
the
judge
can
take
the
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
i
think
that
the
question
of
his
record
is
to
come
into
play
when
he
decides
what
the
disposition
is
to
be
and
i
don’t
think
he
can
have,
he
can
have
his
prior
record
before
him
when
he
makes
a
determination
of
delinquency.
i
think
that
is
going
too
far
at
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
he
must
find
the
underlying
prohibited
conduct
before
making
a
determination
of
delinquency,
the
judge
would
have
to
do
that.
mr.
arlene
specter
correct.
mr.
arlene
specter
indispensable
as
a
matter
of
fun
--
as
a
matter
of
the
gault
requirements
before
there
can
be
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
i
would
--
mr.
arlene
specter
precisely
mr.
justice
harlan,
for
a
wide
variety
of
reasons,
that
judge
can
believe
that
the
act
was
committed
but
can
conclude
that
the
interest
of
the
juvenile,
the
overall
interest
to
the
system.
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that’s
the
critical
question,
that’s
the
broader
benefit
which
the
juvenile
gets
that
he
cannot
get
if
there
is
a
jury
present.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
mr.
justice
black,
i’d
say
precisely
that,
you
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere
and
that’s
the
line.
mr.
arlene
specter
if
i
might
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
sir.
mr.
arlene
specter
there
are
enormous
numbers
of
–
varies
in
the
law
mr.
chief
justice
where
the
juvenile
gets
different
consideration,
different
treatment.
mr.
arlene
specter
then
he
gets
social
security
at
65.
there
are
many
differences
on
ages
in
our
entire
system
and
with
a
rational
basis
they
are
upheld.
everybody
is
not
treated
the
same,
you
must
have
a
cut
off
line
and
that
line
is
the
age.
mr.
arlene
specter
we’ll,
let
me
move
in
response
to
that
if
might,
skipping
parts
of
the
argument
because
of
the
time
problem
into
this
issue
of
promptness
which
i
submit
shows
that
the
juvenile
gets
a
much
better
treatment
the
way
the
court
systems
work
in
practical
consequences.
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
we
are
able
to
deal
with
our
juvenile
problems
in
a
much
better
manner
because
we
do
not
have
the
jury
trial
as
a
matter
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
contrasted
with
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
for
adults.
for
example,
in
the
first
10
months
of
1970,
we
have
tried
slightly
less
than
13000
adult
cases
contrasted
with
slightly
less
than
11000
juvenile
cases.
we
have
25
judges
on
an
average
trying
those
adult
cases.
we
have
five
judges
on
an
average
trying
those
juvenile
cases.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
does
and
i
think
it
does
--
mr.
arlene
specter
i
think
that
it
has
to
and
i
would
move
over
to
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
debacker
versus
brainard
when
he
pointed
out
that
the
juvenile
court
have
not
come
along
as
everyone
had
hoped
that
it
would
because
there
was
not
the
kind
of
a
municipal
budget
to
handle
the
problem.
and
i
think
that
when
you
evaluate
the
juvenile
system
and
say
that
it
is
a
horrendous
system
and
point
to
the
faults
of
it,
i
will
not
stand
here
and
say
that
it
is
a
perfect
system
but
i
will
say
that
if
you
compare
it
to
the
adult
system,
it
is
vastly
preferable.
i
will
not
argue
that
the
schools
are
models
for
juveniles.
in
pennsylvania,
although
i
think
it’s
irrelevant
to
this
in
any
event
but
they
are
vastly
superior
to
the
prisons
for
the
adults.
that
when
you
come
down
to
what
happens
as
you
dispose
in
a
big
city
like
philadelphia
of
11,000
juvenile
cases
and
13,000
adult
cases,
we
have
a
backlog
in
philadelphia
on
the
adults
of
almost
6,000
cases
contrasted
with
1,400
for
juveniles
where
we
are
current.
we
can
give
a
juvenile
and
adjudicatory
hearing
in
two
weeks
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
not
all
are
tried
at
the
first
listing
but
they’re
tried
promptly.
on
the
adult
side,
they
go
on
for
six
months,
12
months,
or
even
18
months.
we
have
in
confinement
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
today
on
the
adult
side
1,885
adults
awaiting
trial.
we
have
juveniles,
249
on
a
system
where
about
half
fit
in
as
adults
and
about
half
fit
in
as
juveniles,
so
that
the
practical
consequence
of
this
juvenile
system
is
that
you
get
the
juvenile
to
court
in
a
hurry
by
comparison
to
the
adults
and
if
there
is
any
juncture
where
rehabilitation
and
the
accurate
of
the
fact
of
a
prompt
trial,
never
mind
where
he
is
sentenced,
where
he’s
sent,
but
the
curative
effect
of
a
prompt
trial,
it
is
certainly
in
the
formative
stage
of
a
young
man's
life,
15
or
16
where
its
done
very
promptly,
much
more
important
to
give
him
that
kind
of
immediate
hearing
and
immediate
determination
than
it
is
someone
who
is
much
older.
mr.
arlene
specter
well,
i
do
not
believe,
it
would
be
appropriate
under
our
constitutional
form
of
government
to
make
any
shift
from
the
traditions
on
adult
trials,
i
think
that
they
are
arms
length
proceedings,
it
is
deeply
ingrained
in
our
system
and
i
think
an
adult
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
i
think
that
one
day
they
will
presented
to
this
court
the
conflict
on
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
with
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
here
this
morning
that
the
establishment
of
priorities
is
a
matter
which
must
affect
all
deliberative
bodies.
it
would
be
preferable
to
keep
out
the
question
of
priorities
in
the
determination
of
constitutional
issues
but
it
is
something
which
is
just
implicit.
we
have
in
our
system
today
a
juvenile
court
responding
to
an
inquiry
made
earlier
by
chief
justice
as
to
our
new
system.
our
juvenile
court
now
is
a
part
of
our
overall
court
system.
if
we
have
jury
trials
in
the
juvenile
courts,
there
must
be
necessarily
a
movement
of
judges
from
the
adult
courts
into
the
juvenile
courts
so
that
the
system
will
become
more
aggravated.
we
have
been
attempting
in
philadelphia
for
the
last
four
years
to
get
30
additional
judges
for
the
city
of
philadelphia
urgently
needed.
and
because
of
state
financial
problems,
we
cannot
get
those
judges
for
the
city
of
philadelphia.
this
maybe
irrelevant
in
terms
of
the
theory
of
constitutional
law
but
it’s
a
very
major
practicality.
we
have
in
pennsylvania
today
a
mandamus
action
brought
by
the
philadelphia
city
courts
against
the
philadelphia
city
council,
to
compel
the
council
to
put
up
$4,000,000.00
to
run
the
courts
and
we
have
gotten
the
judgment
in
the
lower
court
and
it
is
now
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
and
there
is
a
ticklish
issue
of
division
of
responsibility
as
to
whether
the
courts
can
compel
a
legislative
body
that
provide
more
judges
and
necessarily
to
increase
taxes,
but
that
is
where
we
are
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
and
if
we
have
the
necessity
for
juvenile
jury
trial,
i’m
not
going
to
say
to
you
that
its
going
to
overwhelm
our
system
because
that
might
be
placing
the
issue
of
finance
is
too
high
but
i
will
say
to
you
is
that
it
will
leave
the
juvenile
in
much
worst
shape
than
he
is
today
because
when
there
is
an
opportunity
for
a
jury
trial,
it
becomes
to
a
large
extent
a
device
for
delay
which
is
used
with
total
propriety
by
a
defense
lawyer
to
get
the
case
continue.
we
have
a
practice
in
pennsylvania
of
having
the
waiver
signed
at
the
time
of
trial,
must
be
signed
by
the
trial
judge
before
whom
the
case
goes.
we
could
not
under
our
practice
have
a
waiver
in
advance,
and
the
question
is
to
whether
the
case
will
be
bench
trial
or
jury
trial
is
determined
when
the
defendant
is
called
before
that
specific
judge
and
the
decision
is
made
as
to
whether
the
defendant
can
get
is
more
likely
to
be
acquitted
by
that
judge.
we
have
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
along
the
13,000
cases
we’ve
tried
this
year,
only
226
jury
trials,
less
than
2%
of
our
cases
in
adult
court
are
tried
to
a
jury.
it
is
estimated
that
between
30%
to
50%
of
the
cases
there
is
a
demand
for
a
jury
trial
and
it
is
made
as
a
tactical
device
and
no
one
and
i
do
not
now
quarrel
with
that
tactical
device.
but
if
it
is
present
in
the
juvenile
system,
it
will
necessarily
i
submit
to
your
honor
result
in
great
delay.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
black,
--
mr.
arlene
specter
226
jury
trials
--
mr.
arlene
specter
--
adult
court
out
of
almost
13000,
less
than
2%.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
i
would
--
mr.
arlene
specter
no
sir,
i
would
predict
there
would
be
very
few
jury
trials
but
its
present
would
be
a
great
delay
because
when
a
case
is
called,
it
would
be
continued
because
there
is
not
a
jury
available.
when
a
judge
has
a
list
of
say
20
cases,
we
have
them
in
our
philadelphia
adult
courts.
the
judge
may
dispose
of
12
cases
on
that
list
if
he
tries
them
on
a
bench
trial.
if
the
jury
demand
is
made,
that
case
is
put
over,
its
put
over
and
its
put
over
and
its
over
until
its
continued
6,
8,
10,
20
times,
so
that
the
opportunity
for
demand
will
result
in
great
delay.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
arlene
specter
no
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
say
that.
i
think
that
our
traditions
are
too
firm
in
terms
of
according
an
adult
criminal
defendant
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
--
mr.
arlene
specter
yes,
i
do.
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
important
enough
and
i
think
that
the
distinctions
between
the
adults
and
the
juveniles
for
the
other
reasons
that
i
have
given
justify
the
difference
in
treatment
between
adults
and
juveniles
in
terms
of
our
entire
tradition,
and
i
would
close
on
just
that
note.
mr.
arlene
specter
mr.
justice
black,
had
i
selected
my
words
with
perhaps
more
amplification,
i
would
have
rested
it
on
the
constitution,
i
think
it
is
in
the
constitution
because
if
it
is
in
our
tradition
and
i
think
our
constitution
has
embodied
the
tradition
of
our
concepts
of
fundamental
fairness
and
justice.
mr.
arlene
specter
yes
i
do,
i
do,
but
i
think
necessarily
that
when
there
is
an
extension
of
constitutional
right,
as
the
constitution
is
interpreted
differently
in
different
eras
of
that,
there
is
a
necessary
balancing
process
that
this
court
must
undertake
and
that
it
necessarily
involves
the
issues
of
priorities
and
i
would
put
it
in
terms
of
the
juvenile
being
treated
worst
under
a
modified
system
as
opposed
to
the
present
system.
