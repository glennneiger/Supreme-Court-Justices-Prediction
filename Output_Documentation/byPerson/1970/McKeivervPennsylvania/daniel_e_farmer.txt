mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
the
same
constitutional
issue
as
to
proceeding
case
in
reverse
raised.
the
question
is
whether
due
process
requires
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings.
however,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
somewhat
different.
both
joseph
mckeiver
and
edward
terry
were
tried
after
the
date
of
this
court’s
decision
in
duncan
versus
louisiana.
both
were
15-years
old
at
the
time
of
their
trial.
under
pennsylvania
juvenile
court
law,
both
of
them
stood
the
risk
of
confinement
until
they
were
21-years
old.
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
a
possible
outcome
was
that
they
would
be
confined
until
they
were
21.
unfortunately,
the
institutions
in
which
they
risk
confinement
are
far
from
being
as
attractive
as
those
described
for
the
state
of
north
carolina.
the
worst
of
the
institutions
to
which
philadelphia
juveniles
can
withstand
is
a
place
called
camp
hill.
camp
hill
is
a
prison.
it
has
been
described
as
a
prison
by
justice
hoffman
of
our
superior
court
who
for
many
years
was
an
outstanding
juvenile
court
judge.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
could
be
proven
overwhelmingly
that
there
was
no
punishment,
that
in
fact
the
juvenile
court
was
an
exact
parallel
to
the
model
of
let
us
say
a
mental
commitment
proceeding
rather
than
the
stigmatizing
for
the
commission
of
crime
and
punishment
type
of
proceeding
that
it
is,
there
might
be
some
question
as
to
the
right.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
think
it
might
be
your
honor
but
i
don’t
think
i
have
to
maintain
that
because
i
think
it’s
so
clear
from
the
--
both
the
facts
in
pennsylvania
and
the
materials
found
in
the
national
crime
commission,
studies
of
our
juvenile
court
system
that
in
fact
that
it
is
not
a
genuinely
rehabilitative
system.
it
closely
approximate
a
system
of
finding
out
about
wrongs
and
imposing
punishments.
joseph
mckeiver
was
charged
with
robbery,
larceny
and
receiving
stolen
goods.
these
are
felonies
under
the
penal
code
of
pennsylvania.
robbery
carries
an
adult
penalty
of
imprisonment
for
up
to
10
years.
larceny
carries
an
adult
penalty
of
imprisonment
for
up
to
five
years.
edward
terry
was
charged
with
assault
and
battery
and
conspiracy,
those
are
misdemeanors
which
for
an
adult
carry
imprisonment
penalties
of
up
to
two
years.
one
of
the
contentions
made
by
the
opponents
is
that
juvenile
court
judges
view
their
role
in
fact
finding
as
something
very
different
than
their
role
when
they
are
sitting
as
juvenile
court
judges.
but
i
respectfully
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
page
16
of
the
appendix
where
the
court
makes
the
finding
and
the
court
says
and
i
quote,
“the
court
adjudicates
him
delinquent
of
larceny
and
robbery,
does
not
adjudicate
the
juvenile
delinquent
of
receiving
stolen
goods”.
so
its
clear
that
the
court’s
frame
of
mind
as
it
approaches
solely
the
fact
finding
issue
is
very
much
the
frame
of
mind
of
a
judge
when
he
is
trying
the
facts
in
an
adult
criminal
case.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
might
be,
worse
off
your
honor.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
the
process
in
the
juvenile
court,
a
fact
finding
is
almost
identical
even
in
terms
of
the
mental
processes
through
which
the
judge
must
go
with
what
the
judge
goes
through
in
an
adult
bench
trial
for
the
same
crimes.
edward
terry
was
committed
to
a
state
correctional
institution.
joseph
mckeiver
was
placed
on
probation.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
an
effort
to
protect
them,
the
results
are
somewhat
spotty.
in
philadelphia,
there
is
a
serious
problem
created
by
the
fact
that
the
police
maintain
a
parallel
set
of
juvenile
records
over
which
the
juvenile
court
exercises
no
control.
and
so
in
cases
that
the
police
department
deem
to
be
serious,
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
--
they
release
the
information.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
they
do
seem
to
know
your
honor.
when
a
juvenile
is
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
in
juvenile
cases
which
the
police
consider
major,
the
fact
that
a
person
has
been
arrested
and
charged
and
his
past
record
appears
in
the
newspapers
and
i’m
a
member
of
a
bar
association
committee
that’s
trying
to
do
something
about
that
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell
that
information
comes
from
the
police,
they
don’t
deny
it
but
they
won’t
comply
with
the
committee’s
request
to
stop
doing
it.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that’s
right
but
their
record
also
shows
the
past
juvenile
record
of
this
particular
juvenile
and
it
also
shows
the
dispositions.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
of
convictions.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
don’t
know
how
they
get
the
convictions
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
you
mean
what
does
it
require
by
way
of
police
record
keeping?
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
the
law
states
that
juvenile
records
will
not
be
open
to
indiscriminate
public
inspection
but
that
the
records
may
be
seen
by
anyone
having
a
“legitimate
interest.”
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
as
far
as
i
know
it
does.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
believe
it
would
if
they
sought
that
information
from
our
police
department.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
don’t
know.
i
know
that
employer’s
demonstrating
some
kind
of
legitimate
interest
to
get
the
information
i
know
that
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
believe
that
they
can.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
yes,
it
is
a
separate
division
of
our
court
of
common
pleas
which
is
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
no.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
chief
justice,
the
constitutional
revision
had
this
effect.
the
county
court
which
was
formally
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
but
limited
civilly,
those
judges
became
judges
of
the
family
division
of
the
court
of
common
pleas.
so
that
the
present
judges
of
the
family
division
are
judges
who
used
to
be
judges
of
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
but
with
limits
on
the
jurisdiction.
the
issue
that
seems
to
have
drawn
the
most
fire
from
the
other
side
and
which
seems
to
be
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
grant
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
will
interfere
in
those
distinctive
features
of
the
juvenile
court
process
which
hold
out
promise
that
the
system
may
in
the
future
become
genuinely
rehabilitative.
i
would
like
to
go
through
the
juvenile
court
process
step
by
step
to
persuade
this
court
that
the
bulk
indeed
almost
all
of
the
juvenile
court
process
that
relates
to,
its
rehabilitative
purposes
will
not
be
touched
by
jury
trials
which
affect
only
fact
finding.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
i
agree
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
deciding
the
constitutional
issue
is
whether
or
not
fundamental
fairness
requires
a
jury
trial
in
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings.
the
heart
of
the
argument
on
that
point
it
seems
to
me
is
that
every
feature
of
the
fact
finding
face
in
adult
criminal
cases
which
demands
the
right
to
jury
there,
it
also
appears
in
the
fact
finding
face
of
the
juvenile
delinquency
process.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
no
mr.
justice
white,
that
seems
like
an
overly
simplistic
argument
to
me.
the
fact
finding
--
the
features
of
the
juvenile
court
which
distinguish
and
which
hopefully
will
someday
lead
to
it
becoming
a
genuinely
rehabilitative
system
are
first
that
it
has
a
socialized
intake
procedure,
that
is
when
an
arresting
officer
comes
in
with
an
offense,
he
maybe
able
to
make
out
that
the
crime
was
committed
but
an
employee
of
the
juvenile
court
may
decide
that
there
will
not
be
a
delinquency
petition
filed
but
the
case
will
be
adjusted.
the
juvenile
court
judge
has
a
broad
range
of
alternatives
available
to
him
in
terms
of
disposition
of
the
juvenile
prior
to
the
hearing.
he
could
even
begin
the
diagnostic
and
evaluative
faces
of
the
juvenile
court
process
at
that
point
and
save
some
of
the
delay
which
the
other
side
seems
to
be
so
worried
about.
finally,
when
we
turn
to
the
trial
itself,
there’s
a
great
deal
of
talk
from
the
other
side
about
jury
trials
ripping
out
the
socialized
process
of
the
juvenile
court,
jury
trials
interfering
with
the
juvenile
court
judge’s
ability
to
guide
and
mold
the
hearing.
juvenile
jury
trials
injecting
formality
into
the
hearing.
those
ideas
have
tremendous
evocative
power
but
when
we
turn
to
analyze
them
in
detail,
i
think
it
can
be
seen
that
the
--
those
notions
what
the
judge
can
actually
do
are
not
going
to
be
adversely
affected
by
agreeing
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
in
its
brief,
the
national
council
to
juvenile
judges
suggested
as
its
only
concrete
meaning
to
guiding
and
molding
by
the
juvenile
judge
that
the
juvenile
judge
will
no
longer
be
able
to
make
findings
of
delinquency
on
hearsay
evidence
but
1202
in
its
right
to
confrontation
and
cross
examination
is
now
precluding
findings
of
delinquency
based
on
hearsay
evidence.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
chief
justice,
i’m
not
referring
--
i’m
referring
to
that
kind
of
hearsay.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i’m
referring
to
that
kind
of
hearsay
but
the
reports
of
the
social
workers
and
the
probation
officers,
that
kind
of
hearsay
will
still
be
admitted
in
the
dispositive
phase
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
the
treatment
phase,
the
evaluative
phase
just
as
they
would
if
the
right
were
not
imposed.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
but
not
on
the
determination
of
fact.
the
heart
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that
was
the
conclusion
that
was
reached
in
gault
and
we
still
have
a
problem
in
that
regard
even
in
pennsylvania
today
because
the
court
personnel
handed
juvenile
court
judge
the
social
history
folder
of
the
juvenile
and
that
oftentimes
the
judge
just
doesn’t
seem
to
be
able
to
keep
his
eyes
off
the
interesting
things
in
that
folder
while
the
fact
finding
hearing
is
actually
in
process.
that
folder
by
the
way
is
a
very
interesting
folder
because
it’s
stored
by
family
so
that
when
he
opens
that
up,
he
sees
the
social
history
not
only
for
the
juvenile
before
him
but
for
all
his
brothers
and
sisters.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that’s
exactly
correct.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
suggest
that
it’s
a
very
useful
part
of
the
dispositive
process,
it’s
not
at
all
a
useful
part
of
the
fact
finding
process.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
in
the
fact
finding
phase?
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
jury
trial
compels
any
necessity
for
the
trials
to
be
public.
i
don’t
think
that
the
jury
trial
compels
any
broader
release
of
the
records
of
the
juvenile.
i
think
it’s
still
possible
to
maintain
what
limited
kind
of
privacy
the
juvenile
court
now
was
able
to
enjoy
and
have
jury
trials
too.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
one
notion
that
occurred
to
me
to
solve
that
problem
is
to
try
the
juvenile
by
his
first
name
and
last
initial.
to
return
to
the
point
of
the
judge’s
discretion
in
the
fact
finding
hearing,
the
heart
of
his
discretion
it
seems
to
me
the
only
real
legitimate
discretion
he
has
left
in
the
fact
finding
is
this
power
to
find
that
in
fact
the
juvenile
committed
the
act
which
would
be
delinquency
but
to
abstain
in
the
social
best
interest
of
the
juvenile
from
entering
on
the
record
an
adjudication
of
delinquency,
a
jury
trial
won’t
change
that.
as
i
envisioned
it,
the
jury
will
return
a
piece
of
paper
which
says
we
find
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
delinquency
petition
are
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
at
that
point,
the
judge
is
still
free
to
make
his
own
determination
of
whether
the
child’s
best
interest
requires
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
or
not.
he
could
even
suspend
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
pending
some
probationary
period.
that’s
all
the
juvenile
court
judge
can
do
now.
so
there
isn’t
going
to
be
any
reduction
of
the
judge’s
ability
to
guide
and
mold
the
fact
finding
hearing
in
any
legitimate
way
that
he
can
do
that
now.
there
is
also
a
talk
about
formality
interfering
with
rehabilitation
in
the
opponent’s
briefs.
i
think
commonsense
in
the
scoldy
(ph)
opinion
that
cited
in
my
brief
makes
it
quite
clear
that
if
we’re
limiting
our
look
to
the
fact
finding
phase,
there’s
not
going
to
be
any
rehabilitation
during
fact
finding,
formality
or
lack
the
formality
in
the
fact
finding
phase
has
no
effect
really
in
rehabilitation
at
all.
surely,
half
an
hour
being
in
the
courtroom
is
not
going
to
change
behavior
patterns
which
have
been
built
up
over
a
lifetime.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
believe
they
could
do
that
constitutionally,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
no,
i
don’t
think
they
could
mr.
justice
black,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rehabilitative
notion
of
constitutional
law
that
has
appeared
in
some
of
the
circuit
court
decisions
is
a
notion
of
fulfilling
a
statutory
promise,
not
whether
or
not
there’s
a
priory
affirmative
duty
under
the
constitution
to
rehabilitate
children.
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
delay
because
that’s
one
which
is
brought
in
as
a
strong
argument
that
the
grant
of
the
right
to
jury
trials
will
interfere
with
rehabilitation.
it’s
argued
that
such
a
backlog
will
be
created,
that
there
will
be
a
long
gap
between
when
the
juvenile
first
enters
the
system
and
when
the
juvenile
is
tried
and
that
the
rapid
changes
in
his
personality
will
interfere
with
rehabilitation.
i
think
that
the
brief
of
the
public
defender
of
washington
dc
shows
quite
well
that
the
experience
in
the
states
granting
the
right
statutorily
has
been
that
very
few
jury
trials
are
requested.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there
has
been
a
very
special
problem.
there
had
been
a
lot
of
request
for
jury
trials
and
a
serious
backlog
has
been
developed.
and
the
congress
worried
about
that
backlog
and
in
the
belief
that
the
backlog
was
created
by
the
number
of
jury
trial
requests
repealed
the
right
to
jury
trial.
however,
on
page
17
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
public
defender
of
washington,
they
cite
a
professional
management
study
that
was
made
at
the
district
of
columbia
juvenile
court
and
the
conclusion
of
that
study
was
and
this
conclusion
was
not
available
to
the
congress,
the
conclusion
of
that
study
was
that
contrary
to
the
notion
congress
had
in
its
mind
when
they
repealed
the
right
that
the
reason
there
was
a
backlog
was
because
there
was
not
proper
calendar
control,
not
because
there
was
a
large
number
of
request
for
jury
trials.
so
i
think
that
in
repealing
the
right
to
jury
trial,
congress
acted
under
a
misapprehension
of
fact
because
it
did
not
have
that
study
available
to
them.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
have
not
seen
the
report
itself
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
relied
on
the
brief
of
the
public
defendant
for
my
information
about
it
and
that’s
not
revealed
in
the
brief.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
the
duncan
and
louisiana
opinion
as
i
read
it,
the
reason
that
jury
trials
were
found
essential
to
fundamental
fairness
was
that
they
were
a
protection
against
to
use
the
language
of
the
opinion,
the
compliant
bias
to
eccentric
judge,
the
over
zealously
corrupted
prosecutor.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that
is
my
view
mr.
justice
white
and
i
think
it’s
supported
by
the
research
of
calvin
and
zeizle
in
their
book
the
american
jury
which
is
cited
in
my
brief.
their
conclusion
was
that
in
a
significant
percentage
of
cases,
i
believe
16%
the
difference
in
the
factual
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
perhaps
it
is.
the
difference
in
the
result
between
the
jury
and
the
judge
was
due
to
the
jury
having
a
stricter
notion
of
what
reasonable
doubt
required.
there
are
peripheral
advantages,
obviously
having
a
jury
solves
the
problem
of
the
judge
seeing
this
inadmissible
evidence.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
i’d
answer
that
question
this
way.
i
think
if
we
looked
at
all
the
statistics
of
all
trials,
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
yes,
especially
in
the
case
where
in
my
judgment,
i’d
already
limited
the
category
cases
to
those
where
i
had
some
affirmative
reason
for
wanting
a
jury.
if
i
limit
it
to
that
category
of
cases,
i’m
very
strongly
convinced
that
there
would
be
a
sharp
divergence
in
the
result.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
we
would
have
--
let
me
review
the
facts
of
those
cases
very
briefly.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well,
i
think
they’re
such
close
cases
that
there
is
a
high
likelihood
that
they
could
have
gone
the
other
way
with
the
jury,
certainly
in
the
case
of
edward
terry
where
the
judge
approached
the
fact
finding
already
knowing
that
the
juvenile
had
been
convicted
on
a
previous
occasion
of
burglary
that
knowledge
would
have
been
excluded
from
the
purview
of
the
jury
and
that
in
itself
would
be
a
strong
reason
for
thinking
that
a
different
result
would
have
occurred.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
some
of
the
factors
are
really
the
same
factors
as
would
apply
in
an
adult
criminal
case.
my
notion
about
the
disposition
of
the
judge,
the
kind
of
judge
that
he
was
would
be
one
of
the
factors.
another
one
of
the
factors
would
be
whether
the
evidence
against
the
juvenile
consisted
entirely
of
police
testimony.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well,
my
overall
view
about
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
in
the
interest
of
speeding
the
process
and
avoiding
delay,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
objection
to
requiring
the
right
to
be
exercised
by
a
certain
time
we’re
having
at
lost,
that
way,
mr.
specter’s
concern
about
jury
trial
demands
being
used
as
last
minute
requests
to
delay
trial
and
gum
up
the
whole
process
would
be
met.
that
of
course
would
require
you
giving
up
the
tactical
advantage
of
knowing,
being
able
to
dodge
a
particular
judge
the
way
adult
criminal
defendants
try
to
do
but
i
don’t
think
knowing
a
judge,
knowing
who
the
judge
will
be
and
being
able
to
dodge
him
by
requesting
a
jury
trial,
is
it
all
central
to
the
constitutional
issue
here?
with
the
court's
permission,
i’ll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
thank
you.
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
whether
or
not
a
finding
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
automatically
led
to
a
conclusion
that
the
child
was
delinquent,
the
answer
is
a
bifurcated
one.
if
you
read
the
words
of
the
juvenile
court
law,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
but
the
clear
practice
of
the
juvenile
court
is
otherwise.
the
juvenile
court
has
created
for
itself
a
category
which
they
call
and
i
quote
“determined.”
and
when
they
write
determined
across
the
juvenile
delinquency
petition,
it
means
that
facts
were
found
but
for
sociological
reason,
the
juvenile
is
not
being
adjudicated
a
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that’s
correct
and
there’s
no
reason
why
that
couldn’t
happen
with
the
jury
trial.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
is
handed
to
him
and
some
of
the
judges
look
at
it,
not
every
judge
looks
at
it,
it’s
up
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
there’s
a
little
pile
of
them
beside
the
bench
when
the
juvenile’s
case
is
called,
the
clerk
hands
up
the
folder
to
the
judge.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it’s
not
possible
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
there
are
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
there
is
a
pretrial
hearing
in
which
pleas
of
guilty
are
received
and
they
are
bargained
for
and
one
who
pleaded
guilty
is
received
at
that
pretrial
hearing,
a
disposition
is
made
right
at
that
point.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
since
the
plea
of
guilty
always
results
in
a
disposition,
i
can
only
assume
that
in
fact
he
is
pleading
to
the
legal
conclusion
of
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
mr.
specter
spoke
about
four
factors
that
a
jury
trial
were
going
to
interfere
in
intimacy
and
the
role
of
the
judge
as
a
father
figure
and
special
informality.
the
record
in
this
case
is
entirely
reflective
of
the
practice
of
the
juvenile
courts
and
the
court
will
look
in
vain
in
that
record
for
any
special
intimacy
between
the
judge
and
the
juvenile
or
any
father
figure
role
playing
by
the
judge.
as
far
as
fact
finding
is
concerned,
it’s
like
a
criminal
--
an
adult
criminal
bench
trial
pure
and
simple.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
what
the
law
of
england
was.
on
page
19
of
my
brief
at
footnote
24,
there
is
a
citation
to
the
act
in
england
which
provides
for
the
right
of
jury
trials
where
the
juvenile
is
over
14
and
is
charged
with
an
indictable
offense
as
an
act
of
delinquency.
mr.
specter
and
i
are
in
square
disagreement
about
what
the
police
records
are.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
is
the
magistrate’s
courts
act
mr.
justice
brennan
but
i
don’t
know
exactly
what
the
mechanics
are
of
which
court
he’s
tried
in.
mr.
specter
and
i
are
in
square
disagreement
about
what
the
police
records
contain.
mr.
specters
says
they
don’t
record
dispositions,
that's
just
wrong.
on
page
21
of
the
brief,
there
is
a
citation
to
a
study
undertaken
for
national
institute
of
mental
health
by
the
distinguished
criminologist
celine
and
wolfgang,
that
study
uses
as
its
source
of
statistics,
the
police
records
because
the
juvenile
court
records
were
not
made
available
to
professor
celine
and
wolfgang,
so
that
if
it
weren’t
true
that
the
police
records
recorded
all
the
facts
of
a
juvenile’s
history,
that
study
which
you
see
cited
at
page
21
of
the
brief
would
not
be
possible.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
the
same
constitutional
issue
as
to
proceeding
case
in
reverse
raised.
the
question
is
whether
due
process
requires
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings.
however,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
somewhat
different.
both
joseph
mckeiver
and
edward
terry
were
tried
after
the
date
of
this
court’s
decision
in
duncan
versus
louisiana.
both
were
15-years
old
at
the
time
of
their
trial.
under
pennsylvania
juvenile
court
law,
both
of
them
stood
the
risk
of
confinement
until
they
were
21-years
old.
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
a
possible
outcome
was
that
they
would
be
confined
until
they
were
21.
unfortunately,
the
institutions
in
which
they
risk
confinement
are
far
from
being
as
attractive
as
those
described
for
the
state
of
north
carolina.
the
worst
of
the
institutions
to
which
philadelphia
juveniles
can
withstand
is
a
place
called
camp
hill.
camp
hill
is
a
prison.
it
has
been
described
as
a
prison
by
justice
hoffman
of
our
superior
court
who
for
many
years
was
an
outstanding
juvenile
court
judge.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
could
be
proven
overwhelmingly
that
there
was
no
punishment,
that
in
fact
the
juvenile
court
was
an
exact
parallel
to
the
model
of
let
us
say
a
mental
commitment
proceeding
rather
than
the
stigmatizing
for
the
commission
of
crime
and
punishment
type
of
proceeding
that
it
is,
there
might
be
some
question
as
to
the
right.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
think
it
might
be
your
honor
but
i
don’t
think
i
have
to
maintain
that
because
i
think
it’s
so
clear
from
the
--
both
the
facts
in
pennsylvania
and
the
materials
found
in
the
national
crime
commission,
studies
of
our
juvenile
court
system
that
in
fact
that
it
is
not
a
genuinely
rehabilitative
system.
it
closely
approximate
a
system
of
finding
out
about
wrongs
and
imposing
punishments.
joseph
mckeiver
was
charged
with
robbery,
larceny
and
receiving
stolen
goods.
these
are
felonies
under
the
penal
code
of
pennsylvania.
robbery
carries
an
adult
penalty
of
imprisonment
for
up
to
10
years.
larceny
carries
an
adult
penalty
of
imprisonment
for
up
to
five
years.
edward
terry
was
charged
with
assault
and
battery
and
conspiracy,
those
are
misdemeanors
which
for
an
adult
carry
imprisonment
penalties
of
up
to
two
years.
one
of
the
contentions
made
by
the
opponents
is
that
juvenile
court
judges
view
their
role
in
fact
finding
as
something
very
different
than
their
role
when
they
are
sitting
as
juvenile
court
judges.
but
i
respectfully
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
page
16
of
the
appendix
where
the
court
makes
the
finding
and
the
court
says
and
i
quote,
“the
court
adjudicates
him
delinquent
of
larceny
and
robbery,
does
not
adjudicate
the
juvenile
delinquent
of
receiving
stolen
goods”.
so
its
clear
that
the
court’s
frame
of
mind
as
it
approaches
solely
the
fact
finding
issue
is
very
much
the
frame
of
mind
of
a
judge
when
he
is
trying
the
facts
in
an
adult
criminal
case.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
might
be,
worse
off
your
honor.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
the
process
in
the
juvenile
court,
a
fact
finding
is
almost
identical
even
in
terms
of
the
mental
processes
through
which
the
judge
must
go
with
what
the
judge
goes
through
in
an
adult
bench
trial
for
the
same
crimes.
edward
terry
was
committed
to
a
state
correctional
institution.
joseph
mckeiver
was
placed
on
probation.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
an
effort
to
protect
them,
the
results
are
somewhat
spotty.
in
philadelphia,
there
is
a
serious
problem
created
by
the
fact
that
the
police
maintain
a
parallel
set
of
juvenile
records
over
which
the
juvenile
court
exercises
no
control.
and
so
in
cases
that
the
police
department
deem
to
be
serious,
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
--
they
release
the
information.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
they
do
seem
to
know
your
honor.
when
a
juvenile
is
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
in
juvenile
cases
which
the
police
consider
major,
the
fact
that
a
person
has
been
arrested
and
charged
and
his
past
record
appears
in
the
newspapers
and
i’m
a
member
of
a
bar
association
committee
that’s
trying
to
do
something
about
that
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell
that
information
comes
from
the
police,
they
don’t
deny
it
but
they
won’t
comply
with
the
committee’s
request
to
stop
doing
it.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that’s
right
but
their
record
also
shows
the
past
juvenile
record
of
this
particular
juvenile
and
it
also
shows
the
dispositions.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
of
convictions.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
don’t
know
how
they
get
the
convictions
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
you
mean
what
does
it
require
by
way
of
police
record
keeping?
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
the
law
states
that
juvenile
records
will
not
be
open
to
indiscriminate
public
inspection
but
that
the
records
may
be
seen
by
anyone
having
a
“legitimate
interest.”
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
as
far
as
i
know
it
does.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
believe
it
would
if
they
sought
that
information
from
our
police
department.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
don’t
know.
i
know
that
employer’s
demonstrating
some
kind
of
legitimate
interest
to
get
the
information
i
know
that
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
believe
that
they
can.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
yes,
it
is
a
separate
division
of
our
court
of
common
pleas
which
is
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
no.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
chief
justice,
the
constitutional
revision
had
this
effect.
the
county
court
which
was
formally
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
but
limited
civilly,
those
judges
became
judges
of
the
family
division
of
the
court
of
common
pleas.
so
that
the
present
judges
of
the
family
division
are
judges
who
used
to
be
judges
of
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
but
with
limits
on
the
jurisdiction.
the
issue
that
seems
to
have
drawn
the
most
fire
from
the
other
side
and
which
seems
to
be
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
grant
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
will
interfere
in
those
distinctive
features
of
the
juvenile
court
process
which
hold
out
promise
that
the
system
may
in
the
future
become
genuinely
rehabilitative.
i
would
like
to
go
through
the
juvenile
court
process
step
by
step
to
persuade
this
court
that
the
bulk
indeed
almost
all
of
the
juvenile
court
process
that
relates
to,
its
rehabilitative
purposes
will
not
be
touched
by
jury
trials
which
affect
only
fact
finding.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
i
agree
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
deciding
the
constitutional
issue
is
whether
or
not
fundamental
fairness
requires
a
jury
trial
in
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings.
the
heart
of
the
argument
on
that
point
it
seems
to
me
is
that
every
feature
of
the
fact
finding
face
in
adult
criminal
cases
which
demands
the
right
to
jury
there,
it
also
appears
in
the
fact
finding
face
of
the
juvenile
delinquency
process.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
no
mr.
justice
white,
that
seems
like
an
overly
simplistic
argument
to
me.
the
fact
finding
--
the
features
of
the
juvenile
court
which
distinguish
and
which
hopefully
will
someday
lead
to
it
becoming
a
genuinely
rehabilitative
system
are
first
that
it
has
a
socialized
intake
procedure,
that
is
when
an
arresting
officer
comes
in
with
an
offense,
he
maybe
able
to
make
out
that
the
crime
was
committed
but
an
employee
of
the
juvenile
court
may
decide
that
there
will
not
be
a
delinquency
petition
filed
but
the
case
will
be
adjusted.
the
juvenile
court
judge
has
a
broad
range
of
alternatives
available
to
him
in
terms
of
disposition
of
the
juvenile
prior
to
the
hearing.
he
could
even
begin
the
diagnostic
and
evaluative
faces
of
the
juvenile
court
process
at
that
point
and
save
some
of
the
delay
which
the
other
side
seems
to
be
so
worried
about.
finally,
when
we
turn
to
the
trial
itself,
there’s
a
great
deal
of
talk
from
the
other
side
about
jury
trials
ripping
out
the
socialized
process
of
the
juvenile
court,
jury
trials
interfering
with
the
juvenile
court
judge’s
ability
to
guide
and
mold
the
hearing.
juvenile
jury
trials
injecting
formality
into
the
hearing.
those
ideas
have
tremendous
evocative
power
but
when
we
turn
to
analyze
them
in
detail,
i
think
it
can
be
seen
that
the
--
those
notions
what
the
judge
can
actually
do
are
not
going
to
be
adversely
affected
by
agreeing
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
in
its
brief,
the
national
council
to
juvenile
judges
suggested
as
its
only
concrete
meaning
to
guiding
and
molding
by
the
juvenile
judge
that
the
juvenile
judge
will
no
longer
be
able
to
make
findings
of
delinquency
on
hearsay
evidence
but
1202
in
its
right
to
confrontation
and
cross
examination
is
now
precluding
findings
of
delinquency
based
on
hearsay
evidence.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
chief
justice,
i’m
not
referring
--
i’m
referring
to
that
kind
of
hearsay.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i’m
referring
to
that
kind
of
hearsay
but
the
reports
of
the
social
workers
and
the
probation
officers,
that
kind
of
hearsay
will
still
be
admitted
in
the
dispositive
phase
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
the
treatment
phase,
the
evaluative
phase
just
as
they
would
if
the
right
were
not
imposed.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
but
not
on
the
determination
of
fact.
the
heart
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that
was
the
conclusion
that
was
reached
in
gault
and
we
still
have
a
problem
in
that
regard
even
in
pennsylvania
today
because
the
court
personnel
handed
juvenile
court
judge
the
social
history
folder
of
the
juvenile
and
that
oftentimes
the
judge
just
doesn’t
seem
to
be
able
to
keep
his
eyes
off
the
interesting
things
in
that
folder
while
the
fact
finding
hearing
is
actually
in
process.
that
folder
by
the
way
is
a
very
interesting
folder
because
it’s
stored
by
family
so
that
when
he
opens
that
up,
he
sees
the
social
history
not
only
for
the
juvenile
before
him
but
for
all
his
brothers
and
sisters.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that’s
exactly
correct.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
suggest
that
it’s
a
very
useful
part
of
the
dispositive
process,
it’s
not
at
all
a
useful
part
of
the
fact
finding
process.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
in
the
fact
finding
phase?
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
jury
trial
compels
any
necessity
for
the
trials
to
be
public.
i
don’t
think
that
the
jury
trial
compels
any
broader
release
of
the
records
of
the
juvenile.
i
think
it’s
still
possible
to
maintain
what
limited
kind
of
privacy
the
juvenile
court
now
was
able
to
enjoy
and
have
jury
trials
too.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
one
notion
that
occurred
to
me
to
solve
that
problem
is
to
try
the
juvenile
by
his
first
name
and
last
initial.
to
return
to
the
point
of
the
judge’s
discretion
in
the
fact
finding
hearing,
the
heart
of
his
discretion
it
seems
to
me
the
only
real
legitimate
discretion
he
has
left
in
the
fact
finding
is
this
power
to
find
that
in
fact
the
juvenile
committed
the
act
which
would
be
delinquency
but
to
abstain
in
the
social
best
interest
of
the
juvenile
from
entering
on
the
record
an
adjudication
of
delinquency,
a
jury
trial
won’t
change
that.
as
i
envisioned
it,
the
jury
will
return
a
piece
of
paper
which
says
we
find
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
delinquency
petition
are
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
at
that
point,
the
judge
is
still
free
to
make
his
own
determination
of
whether
the
child’s
best
interest
requires
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
or
not.
he
could
even
suspend
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
pending
some
probationary
period.
that’s
all
the
juvenile
court
judge
can
do
now.
so
there
isn’t
going
to
be
any
reduction
of
the
judge’s
ability
to
guide
and
mold
the
fact
finding
hearing
in
any
legitimate
way
that
he
can
do
that
now.
there
is
also
a
talk
about
formality
interfering
with
rehabilitation
in
the
opponent’s
briefs.
i
think
commonsense
in
the
scoldy
(ph)
opinion
that
cited
in
my
brief
makes
it
quite
clear
that
if
we’re
limiting
our
look
to
the
fact
finding
phase,
there’s
not
going
to
be
any
rehabilitation
during
fact
finding,
formality
or
lack
the
formality
in
the
fact
finding
phase
has
no
effect
really
in
rehabilitation
at
all.
surely,
half
an
hour
being
in
the
courtroom
is
not
going
to
change
behavior
patterns
which
have
been
built
up
over
a
lifetime.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
believe
they
could
do
that
constitutionally,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
no,
i
don’t
think
they
could
mr.
justice
black,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rehabilitative
notion
of
constitutional
law
that
has
appeared
in
some
of
the
circuit
court
decisions
is
a
notion
of
fulfilling
a
statutory
promise,
not
whether
or
not
there’s
a
priory
affirmative
duty
under
the
constitution
to
rehabilitate
children.
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
delay
because
that’s
one
which
is
brought
in
as
a
strong
argument
that
the
grant
of
the
right
to
jury
trials
will
interfere
with
rehabilitation.
it’s
argued
that
such
a
backlog
will
be
created,
that
there
will
be
a
long
gap
between
when
the
juvenile
first
enters
the
system
and
when
the
juvenile
is
tried
and
that
the
rapid
changes
in
his
personality
will
interfere
with
rehabilitation.
i
think
that
the
brief
of
the
public
defender
of
washington
dc
shows
quite
well
that
the
experience
in
the
states
granting
the
right
statutorily
has
been
that
very
few
jury
trials
are
requested.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there
has
been
a
very
special
problem.
there
had
been
a
lot
of
request
for
jury
trials
and
a
serious
backlog
has
been
developed.
and
the
congress
worried
about
that
backlog
and
in
the
belief
that
the
backlog
was
created
by
the
number
of
jury
trial
requests
repealed
the
right
to
jury
trial.
however,
on
page
17
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
public
defender
of
washington,
they
cite
a
professional
management
study
that
was
made
at
the
district
of
columbia
juvenile
court
and
the
conclusion
of
that
study
was
and
this
conclusion
was
not
available
to
the
congress,
the
conclusion
of
that
study
was
that
contrary
to
the
notion
congress
had
in
its
mind
when
they
repealed
the
right
that
the
reason
there
was
a
backlog
was
because
there
was
not
proper
calendar
control,
not
because
there
was
a
large
number
of
request
for
jury
trials.
so
i
think
that
in
repealing
the
right
to
jury
trial,
congress
acted
under
a
misapprehension
of
fact
because
it
did
not
have
that
study
available
to
them.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
i
have
not
seen
the
report
itself
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
relied
on
the
brief
of
the
public
defendant
for
my
information
about
it
and
that’s
not
revealed
in
the
brief.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
the
duncan
and
louisiana
opinion
as
i
read
it,
the
reason
that
jury
trials
were
found
essential
to
fundamental
fairness
was
that
they
were
a
protection
against
to
use
the
language
of
the
opinion,
the
compliant
bias
to
eccentric
judge,
the
over
zealously
corrupted
prosecutor.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that
is
my
view
mr.
justice
white
and
i
think
it’s
supported
by
the
research
of
calvin
and
zeizle
in
their
book
the
american
jury
which
is
cited
in
my
brief.
their
conclusion
was
that
in
a
significant
percentage
of
cases,
i
believe
16%
the
difference
in
the
factual
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
perhaps
it
is.
the
difference
in
the
result
between
the
jury
and
the
judge
was
due
to
the
jury
having
a
stricter
notion
of
what
reasonable
doubt
required.
there
are
peripheral
advantages,
obviously
having
a
jury
solves
the
problem
of
the
judge
seeing
this
inadmissible
evidence.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
mr.
justice
white,
i’d
answer
that
question
this
way.
i
think
if
we
looked
at
all
the
statistics
of
all
trials,
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
yes,
especially
in
the
case
where
in
my
judgment,
i’d
already
limited
the
category
cases
to
those
where
i
had
some
affirmative
reason
for
wanting
a
jury.
if
i
limit
it
to
that
category
of
cases,
i’m
very
strongly
convinced
that
there
would
be
a
sharp
divergence
in
the
result.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
we
would
have
--
let
me
review
the
facts
of
those
cases
very
briefly.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well,
i
think
they’re
such
close
cases
that
there
is
a
high
likelihood
that
they
could
have
gone
the
other
way
with
the
jury,
certainly
in
the
case
of
edward
terry
where
the
judge
approached
the
fact
finding
already
knowing
that
the
juvenile
had
been
convicted
on
a
previous
occasion
of
burglary
that
knowledge
would
have
been
excluded
from
the
purview
of
the
jury
and
that
in
itself
would
be
a
strong
reason
for
thinking
that
a
different
result
would
have
occurred.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
some
of
the
factors
are
really
the
same
factors
as
would
apply
in
an
adult
criminal
case.
my
notion
about
the
disposition
of
the
judge,
the
kind
of
judge
that
he
was
would
be
one
of
the
factors.
another
one
of
the
factors
would
be
whether
the
evidence
against
the
juvenile
consisted
entirely
of
police
testimony.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
well,
my
overall
view
about
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
in
the
interest
of
speeding
the
process
and
avoiding
delay,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
objection
to
requiring
the
right
to
be
exercised
by
a
certain
time
we’re
having
at
lost,
that
way,
mr.
specter’s
concern
about
jury
trial
demands
being
used
as
last
minute
requests
to
delay
trial
and
gum
up
the
whole
process
would
be
met.
that
of
course
would
require
you
giving
up
the
tactical
advantage
of
knowing,
being
able
to
dodge
a
particular
judge
the
way
adult
criminal
defendants
try
to
do
but
i
don’t
think
knowing
a
judge,
knowing
who
the
judge
will
be
and
being
able
to
dodge
him
by
requesting
a
jury
trial,
is
it
all
central
to
the
constitutional
issue
here?
with
the
court's
permission,
i’ll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
thank
you.
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
whether
or
not
a
finding
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
automatically
led
to
a
conclusion
that
the
child
was
delinquent,
the
answer
is
a
bifurcated
one.
if
you
read
the
words
of
the
juvenile
court
law,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
but
the
clear
practice
of
the
juvenile
court
is
otherwise.
the
juvenile
court
has
created
for
itself
a
category
which
they
call
and
i
quote
“determined.”
and
when
they
write
determined
across
the
juvenile
delinquency
petition,
it
means
that
facts
were
found
but
for
sociological
reason,
the
juvenile
is
not
being
adjudicated
a
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
that’s
correct
and
there’s
no
reason
why
that
couldn’t
happen
with
the
jury
trial.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
is
handed
to
him
and
some
of
the
judges
look
at
it,
not
every
judge
looks
at
it,
it’s
up
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
there’s
a
little
pile
of
them
beside
the
bench
when
the
juvenile’s
case
is
called,
the
clerk
hands
up
the
folder
to
the
judge.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it’s
not
possible
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
there
are
--
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
there
is
a
pretrial
hearing
in
which
pleas
of
guilty
are
received
and
they
are
bargained
for
and
one
who
pleaded
guilty
is
received
at
that
pretrial
hearing,
a
disposition
is
made
right
at
that
point.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
since
the
plea
of
guilty
always
results
in
a
disposition,
i
can
only
assume
that
in
fact
he
is
pleading
to
the
legal
conclusion
of
an
adjudication
of
delinquency.
mr.
specter
spoke
about
four
factors
that
a
jury
trial
were
going
to
interfere
in
intimacy
and
the
role
of
the
judge
as
a
father
figure
and
special
informality.
the
record
in
this
case
is
entirely
reflective
of
the
practice
of
the
juvenile
courts
and
the
court
will
look
in
vain
in
that
record
for
any
special
intimacy
between
the
judge
and
the
juvenile
or
any
father
figure
role
playing
by
the
judge.
as
far
as
fact
finding
is
concerned,
it’s
like
a
criminal
--
an
adult
criminal
bench
trial
pure
and
simple.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
what
the
law
of
england
was.
on
page
19
of
my
brief
at
footnote
24,
there
is
a
citation
to
the
act
in
england
which
provides
for
the
right
of
jury
trials
where
the
juvenile
is
over
14
and
is
charged
with
an
indictable
offense
as
an
act
of
delinquency.
mr.
specter
and
i
are
in
square
disagreement
about
what
the
police
records
are.
mr.
daniel
e.
farmer
it
is
the
magistrate’s
courts
act
mr.
justice
brennan
but
i
don’t
know
exactly
what
the
mechanics
are
of
which
court
he’s
tried
in.
mr.
specter
and
i
are
in
square
disagreement
about
what
the
police
records
contain.
mr.
specters
says
they
don’t
record
dispositions,
that's
just
wrong.
on
page
21
of
the
brief,
there
is
a
citation
to
a
study
undertaken
for
national
institute
of
mental
health
by
the
distinguished
criminologist
celine
and
wolfgang,
that
study
uses
as
its
source
of
statistics,
the
police
records
because
the
juvenile
court
records
were
not
made
available
to
professor
celine
and
wolfgang,
so
that
if
it
weren’t
true
that
the
police
records
recorded
all
the
facts
of
a
juvenile’s
history,
that
study
which
you
see
cited
at
page
21
of
the
brief
would
not
be
possible.
thank
you
your
honor.
