mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
to
day
for
the
national
council
of
juvenile
court
judges
to
support
the
appellee
in
this
case
and
of
the
case
that
follows
number
322
in
maintaining
that
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
is
made
applicable
to
the
states
for
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
should
not
be
applied
in
juvenile
proceedings.
and
i
might
say
that
counsel
has
no
quarrel
with
and
did
not
of
the
time
those
cases
were
decided
the
gault
and
winship
cases.
the
rights
which
this
court
upheld
on
that
in
those
two
cases
on
quest
they
are
indispensable
to
fair
procedure.
indeed,
actually
the
rights
of
this
court
enunciated
in
gault
their
elementary
procedural
rights
applicable
in
almost
civil
proceeding
that
i
can
conceive
of
--
the
adversary
that
is,
the
only
one
that
is
not
is
the
right
to
counsel
if
he
can’t
afford
and
then
the
civil
law
were
moving
in
that
direction.
and
in
winship,
this
court
found
that
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
which
was
adhered
to
by
every
state
in
the
unions
and
the
colonial
times,
common
law
times
was
a
prime
instrument
for
reducing
the
risk
of
error
in
fact
finding
in
a
proceeding
by
which
a
man
may
lose
his
liberty.
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
held
that
this
is
the
final
and
it’s
indicated
by
not
making
the
jury
trial
retroactive
that
it
considered
the
jury
trial
indispensable
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
moreover,
there's
enough
dispute
about
the
merits
of
the
jury
trial
that
might
raise
at
least
the
question
of
whether
it
is
wise
to
extend
it
in
another
area
unless
the
call
for
its
applicability
is
overwhelming
and
strong
at
least.
i
don’t
think
that
that
can
be
fairly
said
when
the
right
is
attempted
to
be
extended
to
area
where
it
has
not
held
forth
before
except
in
some
states
in
the
juvenile
court
proceedings.
and
i
think
this
court
when
it
gave
us
the
reasonable
doubt
standards
for
juvenile
court
proceedings
gave
some
indication
that
it
would
weigh,
it
would
weigh
whether
or
not
the
jury
trials
advantages
in
the
juvenile
court
system
offset
its
disadvantages
with
respect
to
the
adjudication
procedure.
if
you
recall
with
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
that
case,
conceded
or
is
of
the
opinion
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
did
not
have
any
adverse
effect
on
the
informality,
the
speed
or
the
flexibility
of
the
adjudication.
and
concurring
mr.
justice
harlan
said
about
the
same
thing
but
added
two
other
factors
that
weighed
in
his
mind.
whether
or
not
the
addition
of
the
right
would
increase
the
possibilities
of
public
stigma
of
the
juvenile
and
whether
or
not
it
would
interfere
with
the
worthy
goal
of
rehabilitating.
i
think
analyzing
the
jury
trial
right
in
the
light
of
those
comments
and
balancing
what
it
brings
to
the
adjudication
proceeding,
both
by
way
of
good
and
by
way
of
bad.
i
think
that
scales
are
tipped
in
the
balance
on
the
side
of
not
requiring
the
jury
trial.
i
won't
argue
that
many
children
will
be
traumatically
affected
by
a
jury
trial
but
there
will
be
some
that
will
struck
--
there
are
some
that
will
enjoy
the
little
drama,
bring
out
the
worst
of
them,
there’ll
be
some.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
jury
trial
conduct
it
in
secret
would
stigmatize
a
child
any
more
than
a
juvenile
court
proceeding
conducted
in
secret.
but
does
the
appellant
really
seriously
maintain
that
you
can
give
us
the
jury
trial
and
have
jury
trials
in
camera.
it
wouldn’t
be
long
before
jury
trials
in
the
juvenile
court
would
receive
almost
the
same
attendant
publicity
that
the
trials
in
the
criminal
side
receive.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes
there
are,
your
honor.
yes
there
are.
i’d
like
to
say
though
i
think
the
area
where
the
jury
trial
would
have
its
most
unfortunate
impact
would
be
in
the
area
of
delay.
i
don’t
mean
just
delay
in
the
particular
proceeding
that’s
going
on
taking
the
jury,
making
the
motions
objections,
extending
what
would
be
a
two-hour
hearing
into
a
day
and
a
half
hearing,
that
form
of
delay.
but
delay
in
scheduling
and
then
the
attorney
general
morgan
referred
to
the
290
so
cases
that
were
pending
and
when
the
congress
got
rid
of
the
jury
trial
right
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
i
don’t
believe
that
jury
trials
were
abolished
in
england,
i'm
not
quite
sure.
i
think
they
still
have
magistrates
court
for
the
--
i'm
not
sure
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
your
recollection
was
that
england
get
away
with
the
jury
trial
at
the
juvenile
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
you
may
be
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
you
may
be
correct.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
at
closing
a
one
point
that
was
adverted
to
by
the
attorney
general.
there's
no
question
that
if
the
jury
--
if
the
juvenile
system,
the
rehabilitation
goal
has
failed
in
north
carolina
or
anywhere
and
indeed
if
has
fallen
short
in
many
states,
maybe
the
duke
study
is
absolutely
right,
i
don’t
know.
there’re
certainly
other
states
where
they
rehabilitative
ideal
is
more
an
illusion
than
a
fact.
but
it
seems
to
me
fashioning
the
jury
trial
on
that
won't
cure
that
unfortunate
situation
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
courts
are
going
to
move
in
this
area,
they
should
take
their
cue
from
what
is
being
done
at
least
to
the
circuit
court
level
in
some
of
the
state
supreme
court
levels
in
the
area
of
the
mentally
ill.
a
man
is
deprived
of
his
liberty
because
he’s
mentally
ill
on
the
premise
that
under
the
statute
he’s
going
to
receive
special
treatment
and
he
doesn’t
receive
that
treatment.
there
have
been
several
cases
which
suggest
that
in
such
a
case,
that
equal
protection
is
being
denied
to
them.
i
refer
just
in
passing
to
perhaps
the
ones
that
are
best
known,
one
is
rouse
versus
cameron
decided.
i
believe
when
mr.
chief
justice
burger
was
on
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
373
f.
2d,
then
there
was
judge
sobeloff’s
opinion
for
the
fourth
circuit.
a
man
put
away
under
the
maryland
juvenile
delinquency
act
said
he
wasn’t
getting
a
treatment
or
the
habeas
corpus
that
the
matter
was
not
the
side
of
my
grounds
but
judge
sobeloff
thought
indeed
if
he
could
prove
it,
a
serious
question
of
constitutionality.
and
then
there
was
the
hazel
case,
more
recently
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
very
issue
was
put
but
not
decided.
that
is
whether
the
statutory
promise
of
rehabilitation
for
a
juvenile
can
be
denied
at
juvenile
because
of
the
alleged
and
lack
of
facilities
such
as
our
adversary
has
claimed
as
the
case
in
north
carolina.
there
is
the
area
where
court
should
move,
there
is
the
area
where
courts
can
have
some
long
range
effect
on
making
the
dream
of
the
framers
of
the
juvenile
court
system
become
a
reality
fashioning
the
jury
trial
right
if
that’s
what
it
is,
is
another
matter.
we
make
leave
as
a
result
of
history
in
our
legal
and
constitutional
history
that
as
the
aphorism
goes
that
it’s
better
that
999
persons
go
unpunished
than
one
innocent
man
be
condemned.
but
though
we
seriously
maintain
that
it’s
better,
the
999
juveniles
who
may
need
treatment
not
received
it
less
one
who
need
not
and
doesn’t
need
it
might
get
it.
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
it
varies
i
would
say
your
honor
that,
i
would
say
21
unfortunately
here
under
21.
i
would
like
to
see
the
age
extended
preferably,
because
of
the
special
care
one
can
get.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i’d
like
to
see
the
21,
but
unfortunately
that
congress
has
reduced
to
16
in
the
case
of
serious
crimes.
my
own
personal
opinion
thing
in
this,
that’s
a
mistake
that's
going
back
to
the
--
that’s
going
in
the
direction
that
maybe
our
adversaries
would
like
us
to
go
and
maybe
the
system
is
a
failure.
the
congress
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
a
very,
very
significant
percentage
i
know
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it
usually
is
that
the
juvenile
do
the
act
which
if
they
found
guilty
of
doing
it
renders
him
a
delinquent
within
the
definition
of
the
state
statute.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that’s
correct.
i
gather
there
are
some
that
there's
sort
of
a
two-stage
thing
found
guilty
to
the
act
but
still
a
judge
has
some
leeway
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
a
delinquent.
i
don’t
--
i
can’t
name
the
specific
states
but
i
think
generally
if
he
has
done
the
act
with
which
he
is
charged,
then
technically
he
is
a
delinquent
and
he’s
now
within
the
dispositional
area
of
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that’s
right.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that’s
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
to
day
for
the
national
council
of
juvenile
court
judges
to
support
the
appellee
in
this
case
and
of
the
case
that
follows
number
322
in
maintaining
that
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
is
made
applicable
to
the
states
for
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
should
not
be
applied
in
juvenile
proceedings.
and
i
might
say
that
counsel
has
no
quarrel
with
and
did
not
of
the
time
those
cases
were
decided
the
gault
and
winship
cases.
the
rights
which
this
court
upheld
on
that
in
those
two
cases
on
quest
they
are
indispensable
to
fair
procedure.
indeed,
actually
the
rights
of
this
court
enunciated
in
gault
their
elementary
procedural
rights
applicable
in
almost
civil
proceeding
that
i
can
conceive
of
--
the
adversary
that
is,
the
only
one
that
is
not
is
the
right
to
counsel
if
he
can’t
afford
and
then
the
civil
law
were
moving
in
that
direction.
and
in
winship,
this
court
found
that
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
which
was
adhered
to
by
every
state
in
the
unions
and
the
colonial
times,
common
law
times
was
a
prime
instrument
for
reducing
the
risk
of
error
in
fact
finding

a
proceeding
by
which
a
man
may
lose
his

i
don’t

it’s

moreover,
there's

that

the

unless
the

i
don’t
think
that
that
can
be
fairly
said
when
the
right
is
attempted
to
be
extended
to
area
where
it
has
not
held
forth
before
except
in
some
states
in
the
juvenile
court
proceedings.
and
i
think
this
court
when
it
gave
us
the
reasonable
doubt
standards
for
juvenile
court
proceedings
gave
some
indication
that
it
would
weigh,
it
would
weigh
whether

advantages

and
concurring

weighed
in
his

whether

the
possibilities
of

whether

maryland
juvenile
delinquency
act
said
he
wasn’t
getting
a
treatment
or
the
habeas
corpus
that
the
matter
was
not
the
side
of
my
grounds
but
judge
sobeloff
thought
indeed
if
he
could
prove
it,
a
serious
question
of
constitutionality.
and
then
there
was
the
hazel
case,
more
recently
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
the
very
issue
was
put
but
not
decided.
that
is
whether
the
statutory
promise
of
rehabilitation
for
a
juvenile
can
be
denied
at
juvenile
because
of
the
alleged
and
lack
of
facilities
such
as
our
adversary
has
claimed
as
the
case
in
north
carolina.
there
is
the
area
where
court
should
move,
there
is
the
area
where
courts
can
have
some
long
range
effect
on
making
the
dream
of
the
framers
of
the
juvenile
court
system
become
a
reality
fashioning
the
jury
trial
right
if
that’s
what
it
is,
is
another
matter.
we
make
leave
as
a
result
of
history
in
our
legal
and
constitutional
history
that
as
the
aphorism
goes
that
it’s
better
that
999
persons
go
unpunished
than
one
innocent
man
be
condemned.
but
though
we
seriously
maintain
that
it’s
better,
the
999
juveniles
who
may
need
treatment
not
received
it
less
one
who
need
not
and
doesn’t
need
it
might
get
it.
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
it
varies
i
would
say
your
honor
that,
i
would
say
21
unfortunately
here
under
21.
i
would
like
to
see
the
age
extended
preferably,
because
of
the
special
care
one
can
get.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i’d
like
to
see
the
21,
but
unfortunately
that
congress
has
reduced
to
16
in
the
case
of
serious
crimes.
my
own
personal
opinion
thing
in
this,
that’s
a
mistake
that's
going
back
to
the
--
that’s
going
in
the
direction
that
maybe
our
adversaries
would
like
us
to
go
and
maybe
the
system
is
a
failure.
the
congress
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
a
very,
very
significant
percentage
i
know
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it
usually
is
that
the
juvenile
do
the
act
which
if
they
found
guilty
of
doing
it
renders
him
a
delinquent
within
the
definition
of
the
state
statute.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that’s
correct.
i
gather
there
are
some
that
there's
sort
of
a
two-stage
thing
found
guilty
to
the
act
but
still
a
judge
has
some
leeway
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
a
delinquent.
i
don’t
--
i
can’t
name
the
specific
states
but
i
think
generally
if
he
has
done
the
act
with
which
he
is
charged,
then
technically
he
is
a
delinquent
and
he’s
now
within
the
dispositional
area
of
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that’s
right.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that’s
correct.
