justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
meltsner,
who
would
be
the
parents
for
the
14-year-old?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
two
of
people
could
be
their
parents.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
say
that
position
but
what
you
mean
is
the
regular
jury
panel
that’s
sitting
in
say
the
criminal
court
uphold
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
would
the
trial
will
be
held,
in
the
juvenile
courtroom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
have
it
right
in
the
juvenile
court
like
some
states
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
when
requested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
with
the
same
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
reason
i
say
that
is
you
went
into
great
detail
about
all
the
non-lawyer
judges
all
right.
that
i
never
--
i
couldn’t
imagine
with
that
view
of
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
i
mean
in
this
particular
case,
you
don’t
want
as
to
get
a
new
judge
too,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
take
the
one
that
you
want
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
--
make
no
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
morgan,
what
about
giving
the
juvenile
the
choice
of
having
a
trial
in
the
juvenile
court
as
set
up
as
of
today
or
to
give
that
up
and
say
i’d
rather
have
a
jury
trial
in
the
superior
courts?
give
him
the
choice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
specter,
assume
that
the
juvenile’s
lawyer
explains
all
of
that
as
eloquently
as
you
have
and
the
juvenile
and
his
parent
said
we
still
want
it,
you
wouldn’t
give
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
says
i
appreciate
all
of
that
but
i’d
rather
take
my
chances
on
convincing
one
of
13
than
not
convincing
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
should
he
be
denied
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
could,
well,
he
wouldn’t
object
to
waive
at
all
of
them
pleading
guilty
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
say
that
a
lawyer
that’s
as
good
as
you
are
and
has
explained
to
do
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
still
have
the
pennsylvania
the
possibility
of
a
jury
and
has
equity
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
couldn’t
we
have
a
jury
in
the
juvenile
court,
we
move
in
six
or
12
seats,
extra
seats
and
put
a
jury
in
that
side
and
the
jury’s
sole
job
is
to
find
fact,
is
this
person
delinquent
or
not?
all
of
the
rest
of
his
beautiful
thing
that
you
do
for
juveniles,
the
juvenile
judge
still
does,
what’s
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
judge
could
still
say
that
i
don’t
think
that
he
is
delinquent,
i
don’t
think
he
deserved
to
be
punished?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
cut
back
now.
a
jury
just
found
the
fact
that
he
committed
the
larceny,
i
don’t
think
that
changes
your
argument
at
all,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
all?
justice
thurgood
