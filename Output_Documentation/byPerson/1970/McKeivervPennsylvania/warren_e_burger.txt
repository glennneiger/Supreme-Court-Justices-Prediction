in
re
barbara
burrus.
mr.
meltsner,
you
may
proceed
i
think
now
i’m
sure
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
was
there
any
commitment
to
incarceration
of
these
petitioners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
they
have
never
been
confined?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
state
law,
could
these
petitioners
have
been
tried
in
criminal
court
under
criminal
penalties
and
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
these
petitioners
could
have
been
waived?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
public
be
excluded
going
back
to
justice
brennan’s
question?
i’m
not
sure,
i
see
a
conflict
between
what
you’ve
responded
to
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
i
think
we’ll
not
ask
you
to
start
for
two
minutes.
we’ll
get
in
the
morning
in
fresh.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
re
burrus
against
north
carolina.
mr.
morgan,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
criminal
cases
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that’s
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
consequence
of
the
jury
trial
for
your
state
means
that
all
persons
of
every
age
will
be
tried
in
the
regular
criminal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
superior
court
would
set
as
a
juvenile
court
but
with
all
the
other
panoply
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
whole
idea
is
that
you
have
a
cross-section
and
historically
it
was
to
soften
the
blue,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
scanlan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
scanlan.
you
have
about
three
minutes
left
mr.
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
meltsner.
thank
you
mr.
morgan,
mr.
scanlan.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
in
number
322,
mckeiver
and
terry
against
pennsylvania.
mr.
farmer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
returning
to
what
mr.
justice
white
raised
in
the
previous
argument
that
you
heard,
what’s
the
connection
between
the
kind
of
institutions
and
the
constitutional
issue
involved
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
think
confinement
alone
under
the
--
without
more
is
enough
to
trigger
the
constitutional
claim
for
a
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
could
he
do
it
any
other
way
when
there
are
multiple
specific
acts
of
delinquency
alleged?
wouldn’t
the
whole
process
be
worse
off
if
he
didn’t
pinpoint
his
findings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
changed
any
in
the
recent
constitutional
revision
of
pennsylvania?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
hearsay
i
take
it
you’re
referring
primarily
to
the
traditional
type
of
hearsay
that
was
used
in
juvenile
court
by
way
of
the
judge
acting
on
reports
accumulated
by
the
social
workers
and
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
not
limiting
to
that
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
treatment,
the
treatment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
on
the
determination
of
delinquency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
true
--
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
that
type
of
report
was
widely
used
over
the
years
by
juvenile
courts
on
the
fact
finding
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
suggest
that
that’s
not
a
useful
part
of
the
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
respect
then
you
would
move
it
to
be
just
like
any
other
criminal
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there’s
any
constitutional
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
give
a
different
treatment,
different
in
any
respect
to
juveniles
as
compared
with
adult
offenders?
in
short,
could
the
states
simply
say
that
we
kind
of
wipe
the
juvenile
statutes
off
the
books
and
treat
all
juveniles
as
adults,
the
criminal
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
that
report
on
the
district
of
columbia
show
the
correlation
between
the
request
for
jury
trials
and
the
nature
of
the
delinquency
involved?
in
other
words,
did
it
show
that
jury
trials
were
demanded
in
the
more
serious
cases
and
generally
waived
in
the
less
serious
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
factors
would
you
take
into
account
in
making
the
decision,
whether
you
would
waive
a
jury
or
not
wave
a
jury?
the
age
or
the
child,
the
kind
of
crime,
i’m
a
little
bit
lost
but
you
brought
the
subject
and
i
wonder
how
you
decide
that
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
on
your
theory
then,
you
got
to
make
the
choice
of
waiver
of
jury
before
you
have
the
case
assigned
in
large
court
as
philadelphia
or
washington
dc,
you
can’t
be
sure
which
judge
you’re
going
to
get
until
you’re
assigned
for
trial
and
then
you
would
have
to
have
the
right
to
waive,
you
demand
the
jury
in
the
first
instance
and
then
waive
that
if
you
thought
the
judge
would
be
better,
a
particular
judge
would
be
better?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
specter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
we
draw
that
same
line
now
in
another
area
and
many
other
areas,
one
would
be
on
the
liability
of
an
infant
for
his
contracts,
is
that
as
i
assume
that’s
true
in
pennsylvania?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
its
totally
different
area,
several?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
doesn’t
get
drafted
for
one
thing
and
if
he
gets
over
age
26
or
something
like
that,
then
he
doesn’t
get
back
to
it
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
though
then
is
whether
that’s
a
rational
basis
when
it
comes
to
the
administration
of
penal
law,
i’ll
use
that
term
to
get
away
from
criminal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
specter.
mr.
farmer,
you
have
about
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
