you
did
use

(inaudible)

i
didn’t

i
thought
we
used

or
any

from
keeping

unknown

who
aboard
at
the
duty
of
employing
one
of
those
alternatives
to
be
segregated,
in
that
sense
there
wasn't
an
issue?
unknown

does
that
also
include
the
transportation
[voice

unknown
speaker
perhaps,
i’m
mistaken
but
isn’t
there
possibly
a
little
question
bugging
in
the
statement
of
your
position?
isn’t
the
real
issue
here,
what
is
required
to
completely
disestablish
a
dual
school
system?
the
gentleman
on
this
side
of
the
table
say
that
the
very
disestablish
--
the
very
disestablishment
of
a
dual
school
system
requires
the
elimination
of
all
racially
identifiable
negro
schools
unless
that
is
shown
to
be
absolutely
impossible.
unknown
speaker
and
you
proceed,
you
say
once
a
dual
school
system
is
disestablished,
then
the
neighborhood
schools
were
all
right
and
that’s
kind
of
skipping
over
the
basic
issue,
isn’t
it?
how
is
it
required
to
disestablish
this
dual
school
system?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
can
ask
my
question
this
way
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
position
as
i
understand
it
is
that
once
there
has
been
a
disestablishment,
dismantling
of
a
dual
school
system,
then
a
neighborhood
school
system
is
constitutionally
permissive.
now,
may
i
ask
what
in
your
view
does
the
constitution
require
for
that
first
step
to
disestablish,
to
dismantle
the
dual
school
system
as
a
[voice

unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
why
isn’t
the
one
word
that
applies
to
all
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
discrimination
on
account
of
race
now?
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
saying
is
it
has
to
be
some
race
issue.
unknown
speaker
[voice

on
the
basis
of
race?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
bother
me
with
that
mr.
solicitor
general?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
bother
me
with
that?
because
i’m
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
because
something
was
done
wrong
in
the
past,
my
understanding
of
the
constitution
it
forbids
discrimination
on
account
of
race
now.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
itself
to
do
that
would
amount
to
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don’t
think
under
that
supplemental
clause,
the
court
could
do
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
it
gives
congress
the
power
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
understand
you
to
put
that
on
the
same
level
as
the
power
of
congress,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
how
far
past?
i’m
thinking
for
example
of
my
state
of
ohio,
which
up
until
about
90
years
ago,
a
lot
of
school
boards
to
maintain,
conduct
segregated
schools
explicitly
allow
that.
unknown
speaker
and
about
90
years
ago,
i
will
repeal
that
statute
into
the
way
the
power
of
school
boards
to
maintain
segregated
schools,
but
i’m
sure
they’re
may
be
good
many
vestiges
of
that
former
official
policy.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
in
the
big
cities
of
ohio
as
in
the
big
cities
of
any
other
states
that
i’m
familiar
with,
there
are
neighborhood
residential
patterns
in
which
reflect
[voice

unknown
speaker
of
course
this
question
would
implicate
--
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
not
restrictive
governance
and
housing
practices
--
unknown
speaker
--
are
also
in
the
category
of
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
which
is
not
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
in
this
case,
i
thought.
it’s
certainly
in
the
charlotte
case.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
about
436.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
it
was
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
it’s
in
the
record
of
showing
--
it’s
hard
when
you
have
a
statute
segregating
the
schools
by
races.
it’s
hard
to
--
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
if
there
was
nothing,
no
history
of
a
compulsory
school
segregated
system,
my
state
of
washington
has
never
had
that
by
law,
but
if
they
had
that
--
unknown
speaker
the
state
of
washington.
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
shown
on
the
record
of
pattern
of
restrictive
covenants
produce
these
ghettos,
would
you
think
that
that
would
be
the
jury
segregation?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn’t
be
because
of
de
jure
or
de
facto,
would
it
be
because
of
the
fact
as
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
was
the
state
a
reason
be
that
it
is
discriminatory
action?
unknown
speaker
on
account
of
race?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
excuse
me.
i’d
like
to
pursue
that
just
a
moment.
the
re-segregation
matter,
in
the
experience
of
hew
or
the
department,
have
you
arrived
at
any
rules
of
some
or
even
any
more
complicated
rules
as
to
what
promotes
or
hinders
re-segregation
sense.
is
there
a
tipping
point
that
you
read
about
in
the
brief
or
something
in
the
picture
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenberg
or
mr.
nabrit
yesterday
suggested
that
judge
mcmillan
had
in
mind
this
problem
and
the
remedy
that
he
arrived
at
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
negro
minority
that
could
be
educated
in
white
school
without
having
--
reaching
any
tipping
point.
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
if
you
--
i
would
think
that
is
preventing
re-segregation
is
a
consideration
in
devising
a
remedy
why
you
must
have
some
basis
for
fashioning
that
remedy.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
did
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
objecting
negro
children
should
be
given
the
privilege
of
opting
out
of
[voice

unknown
speaker
well,
what’s
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
to
whether
or
not
objecting
negroes
or
objecting
whites
should
be
able
to
[voice

unknown
speaker
may
i
skip
the
beginning.
are
you
supporting
or
defending
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
state
65?
that’s
the
divided.
unknown
speaker
and
in
terms
of
residential
patterns,
does
record
show
what
percentage
of
negroes
lived
or
what
the
racial
makeup
is
for
those
who
lived
east
to
that
divider
and
those
who
lived
west
to
that
divider
in
mobile?
unknown
speaker
and
for
how
long
a
period
did
it
[voice

unknown
speaker
who
are
the
individual
was
given
a
freedom
of
choice?
unknown
speaker
who
was
given
freedom
of
choice,
pupils
or
parents?
unknown
speaker
was
it
wide-open
freedom
of
choice?
unknown
speaker
majority
to
minority,
minority
to
majority,
both
races?
unknown
speaker
and
which
is
really
not
very
much
an
issue
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
out
of
total
of
how
many
schools?
unknown
speaker
are
the
two
all-black
elementary
schools?
unknown
speaker
and
the
five
all-white
elementary
schools?
unknown
speaker
and
all
in
the
city?
unknown
speaker
where
are
the
two
all-black
schools?
unknown
speaker
they’re
within
the
eastern
portion
of
[voice

what
neighborhood?
what
did
they
call
the
community
or
the
neighborhood
or
whatever
they
are.
where
are
the
two
all-black
schools
are?
unknown
speaker
brazier.
unknown
speaker
is
grant.
unknown
speaker
that’s
all
of
it.
unknown
speaker
now,
why
are
they
all
black
according
to
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
are
all
the
people
who
live
in
that
zone
black?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
several
other
schools
that
have
--
several
other
schools
that
have
no
more
than
10%
white.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
three
schools
white,
two
white
and
three
white
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
two
and
three.
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
800
blacks
have
gone?
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
thousand
white
people
go,
white
students?
unknown
speaker
you
have
the
figures
for
all
the
other
schools,
are
they
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
on
the
actual
--
i
mean,
the
actual
attendance
as
compared
of
what
the
court
has
contemplated?
unknown
speaker
may
i
have
one
other
question
before
you
leave
the
point
you
own?
you
have
just
referred
to
a
district
that
alleged
all
black.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
argument
of
the
others
as
to
how
you
could
get
white
people
into
that
school
should?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what
is
the
argument
of
the
other
side
from
you
as
to
what
you
should
do
to
change
that
black
school
all-black
into
having
some
whites?
what
would
be
your
guide?
unknown
speaker
of
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
pick
out
another
area?
unknown
speaker
that
of
a
white
school?
unknown
speaker
pick
out
another
area
and
cross
bus
students?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
can
put
the
white
over
unto
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
blacks,
some
of
the
blacks
herein
to
another?
unknown
speaker
that
means
sending
--
i
just
want
to
get
exactly
what
it
means,
does
that
mean
sending
some
of
the
blacks
on
a
13-mile
drive
away
from
schools
that
are
close
to
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
going
to
ask
about
whites
too.
it
means
sending
both
of
them.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
there
are
some
people
who
live
in
that
vicinity,
who
have
children
of
different
ages
and
different
grades?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
separate
the
family?
unknown
speaker
the
children?
unknown
speaker
so
that
one
of
them
would
have
to
go
to
a
school
13
miles
away
and
another
one,
one
closer
to
it?
unknown
speaker
is
whistler
a
part
of
mobile?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
different
city
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it’s
in
greater
--
what
you
call
greater
mobile?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
court’s
order
that
you’re
attacking?
unknown
speaker
that’s
not
required
by
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
you’re
attacking?
unknown
speaker
--
would
that
same
condition
continue
with
reference
to
the
personnel
of
the
school
in
it
too?
unknown
speaker
and
only
one
teacher,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
you
could
hardly
have
a
biracial
faculty,
wouldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
those
were
white?
do
you
know
how
many
white
and
how
many
colored
as
for
transfer?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
record
showing
how
many
of
them
wanted
to
be
transferred
to
get
away
from
long
busing?
unknown
speaker
they’re
not
allowed
to
give
that
as
a
reason
though,
that’s
not
a
permissible
reason,
does
it
under
the
existing
system?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
one
is
a
hu
zone?
unknown
speaker
hew?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
of
them
live
in
mobile?
unknown
speaker
and
the
people
who
drew
those
zones?
unknown
speaker
but
in
high
school,
i
would
presume
they
will
be
about
public
transportation.
unknown
speaker
beginning
with
grade?
beginning
with
after
grade
6,
beginning
at
grade
7?
unknown
speaker
six
through
nine?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
neighborhood
schools?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
judge
thomas
has
not
given
you
a
hearing
over
any
hearing
at
all
at
any
time?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
did
use
a

(inaudible)

reason
be
that
it
is
discriminatory
action?
unknown
speaker
on
account
of
race?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
excuse
me.
i’d
like
to
pursue
that
just
a
moment.
the
re-segregation
matter,
in
the
experience
of
hew
or
the
department,
have
you
arrived
at
any
rules
of
some
or
even
any
more
complicated
rules
as
to
what
promotes
or
hinders
re-segregation
sense.
is
there
a
tipping
point
that
you
read
about
in
the
brief
or
something
in
the
picture
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenberg
or
mr.
nabrit
yesterday
suggested
that
judge
mcmillan
had
in
mind
this
problem
and
the
remedy
that
he
arrived
at
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
negro
minority
that
could
be
educated
in
white
school
without
having
--
reaching
any
tipping
point.
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
if
you
--
i
would
think
that
is
preventing
re-segregation
is
a
consideration
in
devising
a
remedy
why
you
must
have
some
basis
for
fashioning
that
remedy.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
did
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
objecting
negro
children
should
be
given
the
privilege
of
opting
out
of
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
well,
what’s
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
to
whether
or
not
objecting
negroes
or
objecting
whites
should
be
able
to
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
may
i
skip
the
beginning.
are
you
supporting
or
defending
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
state
65?
that’s
the
divided.
unknown
speaker
and
in
terms
of
residential
patterns,
does
record
show
what
percentage
of
negroes
lived
or
what
the
racial
makeup
is
for
those
who
lived
east
to
that
divider
and
those
who
lived
west
to
that
divider
in
mobile?
unknown
speaker
and
for
how
long
a
period
did
it
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
who
are
the
individual
was
given
a
freedom
of
choice?
unknown
speaker
who
was
given
freedom
of
choice,
pupils
or
parents?
unknown
speaker
was
it
wide-open
freedom
of
choice?
unknown
speaker
majority
to
minority,
minority
to
majority,
both
races?
unknown
speaker
and
which
is
really
not
very
much
an
issue
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
out
of
total
of
how
many
schools?
unknown
speaker
are
the
two
all-black
elementary
schools?
unknown
speaker
and
the
five
all-white
elementary
schools?
unknown
speaker
and
all
in
the
city?
unknown
speaker
where
are
the
two
all-black
schools?
unknown
speaker
they’re
within
the
eastern
portion
of
[voice
overlap]?
what
neighborhood?
what
did
they
call
the
community
or
the
neighborhood
or
whatever
they
are.
where
are
the
two
all-black
schools
are?
unknown
speaker
brazier.
unknown
speaker
is
grant.
unknown
speaker
that’s
all
of
it.
unknown
speaker
now,
why
are
they
all
black
according
to
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
are
all
the
people
who
live
in
that
zone
black?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
several
other
schools
that
have
--
several
other
schools
that
have
no
more
than
10%
white.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
three
schools
white,
two
white
and
three
white
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
two
and
three.
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
800
blacks
have
gone?
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
thousand
white
people
go,
white
students?
unknown
speaker
you
have
the
figures
for
all
the
other
schools,
are
they
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
on
the
actual
--
i
mean,
the
actual
attendance
as
compared
of
what
the
court
has
contemplated?
unknown
speaker
may
i
have
one
other
question
before
you
leave
the
point
you
own?
you
have
just
referred
to
a
district
that
alleged
all
black.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
argument
of
the
others
as
to
how
you
could
get
white
people
into
that
school
should?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what
is
the
argument
of
the
other
side
from
you
as
to
what
you
should
do
to
change
that
black
school
all-black
into
having
some
whites?
what
would
be
your
guide?
unknown
speaker
of
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
pick
out
another
area?
unknown
speaker
that
of
a
white
school?
unknown
speaker
pick
out
another
area
and
cross
bus
students?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
can
put
the
white
over
unto
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
blacks,
some
of
the
blacks
herein
to
another?
unknown
speaker
that
means
sending
--
i
just
want
to
get
exactly
what
it
means,
does
that
mean
sending
some
of
the
blacks
on
a
13-mile
drive
away
from
schools
that
are
close
to
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
going
to
ask
about
whites
too.
it
means
sending
both
of
them.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
there
are
some
people
who
live
in
that
vicinity,
who
have
children
of
different
ages
and
different
grades?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
separate
the
family?
unknown
speaker
the
children?
unknown
speaker
so
that
one
of
them
would
have
to
go
to
a
school
13
miles
away
and
another
one,
one
closer
to
it?
unknown
speaker
is
whistler
a
part
of
mobile?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
different
city
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it’s
in
greater
--
what
you
call
greater
mobile?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
court’s
order
that
you’re
attacking?
unknown
speaker
that’s
not
required
by
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
you’re
attacking?
unknown
speaker
--
would
that
same
condition
continue
with
reference
to
the
personnel
of
the
school
in
it
too?
unknown
speaker
and
only
one
teacher,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
you
could
hardly
have
a
biracial
faculty,
wouldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
those
were
white?
do
you
know
how
many
white
and
how
many
colored
as
for
transfer?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
record
showing
how
many
of
them
wanted
to
be
transferred
to
get
away
from
long
busing?
unknown
speaker
they’re
not
allowed
to
give
that
as
a
reason
though,
that’s
not
a
permissible
reason,
does
it
under
the
existing
system?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
one
is
a
hu
zone?
unknown
speaker
hew?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
how
many
of
them
live
in
mobile?
unknown
speaker
and
the
people
who
drew
those
zones?
unknown
speaker
but
in
high
school,
i
would
presume
they
will
be
about
public
transportation.
unknown
speaker
beginning
with
grade?
beginning
with
after
grade
6,
beginning
at
grade
7?
unknown
speaker
six
through
nine?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
neighborhood
schools?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
judge
thomas
has
not
given
you
a
hearing
over
any
hearing
at
all
at
any
time?
