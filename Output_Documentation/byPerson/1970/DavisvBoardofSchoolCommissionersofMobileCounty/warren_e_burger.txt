mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re

chief

e.

before
you
more
that
mr.

coming
to
the
corridors
you
called
it
between
the
two
blue
sections
with
the

thomas
on

to
what
school
students
in
that
area
go?
where
are
they
assigned?
chief

warren
e.
burger
yes.
i’m
trying
to
follow
that
on
your
exhibit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
want
to
know
is
where
was
at
the
time
of
this
map,
in
other
words
i
am
searching
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
outlines
of
the
thomas
school
are
not
shown
on
this
map
zone,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
just
like
green
line?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
that
would
end
it
just
in
this
particular
case,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
end
it,
your
objective
was
to
end
it
forever.
that
would
end
it
just
in
the
areas
you
have
shown
on
your
map,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
if
we
found
this
effective
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
while
we’re
there,
i
suppose
mobile
is
no
exception
to
what
is
true
in
almost
every
large
community
in
the
country
that
there
is
a
more
or
less
constant
movement
of
people,
sometimes
described
as
an
upward
movement,
people
trying
and
like
--
with
a
two
bedroom
house,
trying
to
get
a
three
bedroom
house
or
a
three
bedroom
house
trying
to
get
a
four
bedroom
house,
this
movement
is
going
on.
how
does
the
district
court
in
performing
this
function
keep
track
of
the
changes
that
would
flow
from
that?
i
assume
that
you
would
agree
that
changes
will
flow
from
that
upward
movement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
i
can
propose
a
hypothetical
situation
to
you,
assume
that
in
a
given
district
where
you
have
a
racial
balance
of
the
school
which,
as
of
today
you
find
acceptable
and
that
three
years
from
now
by
the
so
called
upward
movement,
the
population
of
that
area
has
changed
so
that
the
balance
no
longer
satisfies
the
standard
racial
balance
that
is
found
acceptable
today
in
1970.
is
that
a
matter
as
to
which
the
court
should
grant
a
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
the
hypothesis
i
was
putting
to
you,
there
is
no
element
of
discrimination
that
brings
this
about,
but
merely
natural
change
in
the
structure
of
the
community.
so
is
it
your
position
then
that
the
court
has
a
duty
to
--
the
school
board
in
the
first
instance,
the
court,
the
parties,
must
go
in
and
see
to
it
that
adjustments
are
made
to
reflect
the
composition
of
the
community,
independent
of
any
discriminatory
motive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
i’m
driving
at
is
that
last
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
you.
is
this
always
tied
to
a
discriminatory
motivation
or
does
this
requirement
of
the
racial
balance
exists
independent
of
the
reason
and
source?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
were
reciting
some
figures
to
this,
what
do
those
figures
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
corrective
parts,
because
you
have
--
you
mentioned
some
specific
figure,
i
forgot
now
what
it
was.
corresponding
to
the
7129
figure
in
the
case
we
argued
yesterday.
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
then
i
suppose
i
give
it

chief

e.

i
think
we’ll
take
it
up
at
10

chief

mr.

chief

we’ll

then
with

chief

chief

e.

wouldn’t
you
want

you

do
i
--
let

are
you
telling

that

relating

the

chief

these

by

i
take
it
they’re
in

chief

which

chief

e.

mr.

it
may
--
i
hope
it
doesn’t
interrupt
your

i’m
concerned
about

missing

1001

of

59
out

chief

has
anyone

you
said
there’s
no

whether
they

chief

has
that
been

chief

can
you

it

how

if
