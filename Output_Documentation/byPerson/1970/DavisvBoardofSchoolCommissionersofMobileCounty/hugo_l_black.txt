black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
(inaudible)
clear
on
your
(inaudible).
there
was
a
village
in
alabama
that
i
lived
in,
it
was
100%
colored.
they
had
a
mayor
who
is
colored.
they
had
a
board
of
aldermen,
colored.
so
they
were
granted
by
colored
people.
that
was
by
nature,
whether
that
is
maybe
that
there
is
some
reason
why
they
had
concentrated
but
they
were
there.
would
it
be
your
view
that
a
place
like
that
would
have
to
come
under
the
rule
which
you
are
asking
for?
