mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
we
begin
our
argument
time,
we
have
some
maps
on
an
easel
that
we
could
not
bring
in
because
of
the
admission
ceremonies
which
we
need
to
bring
it
now.
it
will
make
a
moment.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
wait.
your
honor,
we
have
another.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
board
of
school
commissioners
of
mobile
county.
my
client
was
the
defendant
and
the
appellee
below
and
it’s
a
respondent
here.
i’m
advised
by
the
clerk
that
i
have
45
minutes
time
for
argument
plus
to
share
this
with
another
respondent,
the
parent-teacher
association.
so
i
will
attempt
to
limit
my
argument
to
not
more
than
30
minutes.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
we
asked
that
the
judgment
be
overturned
and
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
the
formulation
of
a
new
plan
within
the
light
of
certain
principles
that
we
hope
the
court
would
reaffirm.
although
i’m
press
for
time
to
present
my
own
argument,
several
assertions
made
by
the
petitioner
yesterday
should
not
go
unanswered,
so
i
will
rejoin
just
briefly.
petitioner
stated
that
the
school
board
has
changed
its
people
assignment
plan
from
year
to
year
and
sometimes
more
frequently.
may
i
remind
the
court
that
since
august
1966,
this
school
system
has
each
year
received
an
order
of
the
court
requiring
a
new
or
change
desegregation
plan.
but
since
1967,
the
student
assignment
portions
of
these
plans
have
been
devised
by
someone
other
than
the
school
board,
either
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
hew
of
the
department
of
justice.
since
january
1970,
we
have
been
ordered
to
implement
six
different
plans
of
student
assignment
in
the
desegregation
process
is
not
the
board
that
has
been
changing
the
plan.
they
are
merely
attempting
to
the
best
of
their
ability
to
carry
out
the
orders
of
the
court.
petitioner
in
its
argument
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
well,
they
are
different
from
one
another.
they
take
different
approaches.
they
draw
different
zones,
one
withdrawn
by
hew,
one
by
the
justice
department,
one
by
the
court
of
appeals,
two
by
the
district
court.
several
were
superseded
before
they
could
be
placed
into
implementation.
others,
the
steps
towards
implementation
began
and
then
they
were
superseded.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
a
combination
plan
that
involves
elements
of
a
plan
drawn
by
hew
modified
by
the
justice
department,
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
modified
by
the
district
court
and
re-modified
by
the
court
of
appeals.
petitioner
has
framed
its
argument
procedurally
in
terms
of
results,
not
the
constitution
but
results.
so
let
me
show
you
something
of
result.
craighead
school
listed
on
mr.
greenberg’s
map
is
76%
black.
this
in
the
time
of
the
dual
school
system
was
an
all-white
school.
lienkauf
64%
black
at
one
time
an
all-white
school.
old
shell
road
80%
black
at
one
time
an
all-white
school.
palmer
at
one
time
an
all-white
school,
now
listed
by
mr.
greenberg
is
all-black.
glendale
at
one
time
an
all-white
school,
now
listed
by
mr.
greenberg
at
70%
black,
the
same
pattern
goes
through
out.
thomas
62%
white
once
an
all-black
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that’s
the
divided.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
think
east
of
the
divider,
is
roughly
60%
black,
40%
white.
west
is
roughly
70%
white
and
30%
black.
so
this
is
some
of
the
results
if
we
wish
to
frame
things
in
terms
of
results
rather
than
in
terms
of
complying
with
the
constitutional
mandate.
now,
let’s
turn
to
a
moment
to
another
question
that
was
raised
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
fact
that
busing
to
preserve
segregation
occurred
in
the
past
and
this
is
freely
admitted
in
the
brief.
they
point
two
examples
of
busing
for
example
where
the
students
in
this
area
which
is
in
the
rural
area
and
i
might
remind
the
court
that
this
is
a
map
of
metropolitan
mobile,
prichard
and
chickasaw,
three
cities
with
co-terminus
boundary
lines.
this
is
roughly
18
miles
north
to
south
and
13
miles
from
east
to
west.
the
county
itself
is
53
miles
from
north
to
south
and
27
miles
east
to
west,
from
the
river
to
the
mississippi
line
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
north.
with
reference
to
the
bus,
students
carried
from
these
area
black
students
bused
to
this
area
four
or
five
years
ago
into
this
school.
unquestionably
this
occurred,
but
these
students
are
no
longer
bused
and
have
not
been
bused
for
four
or
five
years.
how
can
it
be
contended
that
there’s
any
effect
left
from
the
dual
system
as
a
result
of
busing
30
students
from
here
to
here
five
years
ago?
certainly,
it
was
in
effect
at
that
time
but
we’re
dealing
with
a
presently
existing
effect
of
the
once
dual
system.
the
same
thing
occurs
with
reference
to
split
zones
of
nine
contiguous
zones
as
petitioner
referred
to
yesterday.
with
reference
to
the
whistler
and
thomas
schools
indicating
the
fact
that
one
time
thomas
an
all-negro
schools
questioned
an
all-white
school
and
people
from
this
area
whereas
the
time
there
was
no
school
went
pass
to
the
thomas
school
to
the
whistler
school.
there
again,
this
occurred
four
or
five
years
ago.
where
can
it
be
any
present
existing
effect
from
this
as
it
exist
now
when
you
consider
that
thomas,
which
was
once
the
all-negro
school
is
now
62%
white
and
has
been
for
two
school
terms
predominantly
white.
and
whistler,
which
was
at
one
time
all
white
is
now
52%
white
although
last
year
it
was
predominantly
negro.
petitioner
has
stated
that
mobile
has
never
adhered
to
the
neighborhood
school
concept.
this
is
incorrect
and
i
must
adopt
at
least
in
the
part
of
the
language
of
the
solicitor
general
with
reference
to
the
misconception
with
reference
to
the
clichés
or
seizing
upon
words
such
as
the
neighborhood
skill
concept.
as
the
record
will
show,
the
mobile
school
system
has
always
adhered
to
and
favored
the
neighborhood
school’s
concept
based
upon
specific
geographic
zones
except
when
ordered
by
the
court
to
do
otherwise.
admittedly,
prior
to
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system,
at
one
time
they
existed
that
the
dual
zones,
overlapping
zones,
one
zone
for
black,
one
zone
for
white,
superimposed
upon
one
another.
this
has
been
disestablished
and
was
disestablished
as
much
as
four
years
ago
by
the
simple
elimination
of
both
zones
redrawing
the
zone
around
each
school,
a
unitary
zone
so
that
every
person,
black
or
white
goes
to
the
school
within
the
zone
regardless
of
the
present
or
past
racial
makeup
of
the
school.
admittedly,
prior
to
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
system,
there
were
these
overlapping
zones
but
they
no
longer
exist
and
it
should
be
observed
in
its
adherence
to
the
neighborhood
school
concept
as
a
concept.
the
mobile
board
opposed
freedom
of
choice
when
this
first
concept
looked
upon
as
apparently
a
panacea,
which
didn’t
pan
out
first
came
upon
the
scene.
admittedly,
several
years
after
the
freedom
of
choice
concept,
which
was
foreign
to
the
mobile
school
system
came
upon
the
public
saying
that
board’s
republic
pressure
was
forced
into
asking
the
court
for
freedom
of
choice.
but
we
have
never
had
freedom
of
choice
in
the
mobile
public
school
system
except
when
it
was
specifically
requested
by
motion
of
the
justice
department
for
a
freedom
of
choice
in
the
rural
portion
of
the
system.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
when
the
freedom
of
choice?
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
now
i
think
it
was
--
i
think
it
came
in
the
decree
of
the
district
court
in
july
and
august
1968.
the
district
court
entered
a
decree
on
july
the
29th
pursuant
to
the
motion
to
amend
by
the
justice
department
at
the
end
of
the
supplemental
decree
on
august
the
2nd,
three
days
later.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
that.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
--
it
was
a
jefferson-type
freedom
of
choice
allowing
the
pupil
above
a
certain
age
or
for
the
younger
pupils,
the
parent
should
exercise
its
choice
in
his
behalf.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
wide
open
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
it
was
full
freedom
of
choice
within
the
terms
of
freedom
of
choice
specified
by
the
jefferson
decree.
if
you
recall
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
jefferson,
spelled
out
very
specifically
and
minutely
a
method
of
applying
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
and
this
was
adopted
by
the
district
court,
and
ordered
for
implementation
in
the
portion
of
the
system.
even
there,
the
freedom
of
choice
was
limited
to
the
rural
portion
of
the
system,
which
is
not
shown
here.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
certainly
pointed
out
from
the
standpoint
to
show
that
we
--
the
school
board
in
adhering
to
its
favoritism
for
the
neighborhood
school
concept
even
opposed
that
at
that
time,
it
was
placed
upon.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
what
i
understand
[voice
overlap]
but
you
obsess
them
to
me.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
it
was
in
fact
--
it
was
at
that
time,
on
a
dual
system,
a
dual
set
of
zones
but
we
have
disestablished
the
dual
system,
we
have
disestablished
the
dual
zones.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
in
every
area.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
of
the
city.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
and
the
county.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
as
i
recall,
we
have
seven
schools
that
are
literally
all-black
or
all-white,
two
of
them,
all-black
and
five
all-white.
this
is
throughout
the
entire
system.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
eighty-three
schools.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
believe
--
i
believe
they’re
all
five,
yes
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
two
all-black
schools
are
within
the
city.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
one
is
brazier.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
and
the
other,
i
think
is
grant.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
it’s
grant
but
i’m
not
that
certain
that
set
out
in
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
supplemental
brief
for
the
petitioners.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
its
brazier
and
owens.
they
are
black
in
my
judgment
because
--
well,
if
you’ll
notice
brazier,
it’s
difficult
to
see
if
you
can
observe
this
district.
it’s
bounded
on
the
western
edge
by
the
beltline
of
federal
interstate
highway.
the
zone
is
rather
symmetrical
the
school
is
on
the
far
edge
of
the
beltline.
no
matter
how
far
you
extend
this
zone,
this
is
a
predominantly
black
school
and
predominantly
for
all-black
school
enlisted
by
mr.
greenberg.
this
was
once
an
all-white
school
but
it’s
now
all
black,
an
all-black
school.
and
this
school
which
was
once
all
white
and
is
67%
white
now.
so
it’s
(inaudible)
by
the
beltline
of
one
side
and
essentially,
by
all
black
areas
on
the
other.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
think
they
are
your
honor.
i
think
they
are.
i’m
not
aware
of
any
white
students
living
in
the
zone.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that
is
right.
i
said
literally
all
black.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that’s
correct.
let
me
call
your
attention
to
page
3
of
petitioner’s
supplemental
brief.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
two
and
three.
look
at
page
3
to
the
high
schools.
blount
high
school,
black
2033,
white
41,
this
is
the
actual
enrollment.
the
zone
drawn
by
the
court
and
assigned
to
that
school
is
1233
black,
1041
white,
out
of
1041
students,
41
are
in
attendance.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
have
bad
ideas
to
that.
we
know
as
the
record
has
indicated
and
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief,
this
school
system,
since
1965,
when
the
population
of
mobile
has
increased
constantly
and
the
school
age
population
even
more
proportionate.
while
the
population
has
continued
to
increase
since
1965,
the
school
enrollment
has
gone
down.
we’re
now
some
10,000
students
less
than
we
had
in
1965.
we
know
that
many
of
the
students
have
enrolled
in
private
school.
we
know
that
many
of
these
students
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
blount
zone
as
assigned
by
the
court
have
simply
moved
their
residence,
some
within
this
county,
some
to
other
places,
perhaps
some
to
other
parts
of
the
country
that
have
not
yet
faced
this
problem.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
they’re
all
before
the
court
in
this
respect.
in
my
brief,
i
have
a
chart
at
page
7,
which
shows
the
assigned
enrollments
according
to
the
assignment
made
by
the
court.
in
the
supplemental
brief
of
petitioner,
they
set
out
the
enrollment
as
of
october
2nd.
in
1963,
when
the
desegregation
litigation
first
began
in
the
school
system,
it
was
in
both
at
legal
and
a
practical
sense,
a
dual
school
system.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
hew
and
the
justice
department
along
with
the
school
board
have
struggled
with
that
problem
for
three
or
four
years
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
do
it.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
even
to
close
the
school
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
even
to
close
the
school,
and
we
have
closed
during
the
process
of
this
litigation,
12
to
16
schools,
12
which
were
all
black
at
one
time
in
an
effort
to
eliminate
all
black
schools.
the
only
other
solution
they
suggest
is
to
pick
out
the
white
or
near
all-white
school
and
cross
bus.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
i’m
right,
i’ll
use
or
another
mr.
greenberg’s
map.
an
example
of
that
is
the
thing
they
would
do
with
thomas
school
and
whitley
school.
this
is
the
plan
drawn
by
hew.
the
plan
b
one
alternative
by
which
hew
proposes
to
do
all
of
this
cross
busing,
this
is
where
every
two
or
three
attendance
areas
within
the
system
are
packed
together
for
example,
dodge,
owens,
this
is
roughly
13
miles.
williams,
they
make
the
three-corner
pairing
of
these
zones.
they
send
every
student
in
grade
1
and
2
from
all
the
three
zones,
to
one
of
these
schools
that
means,
busing
15
miles
from
here
and
here
and
9
miles
from
here
and
here.
they
send
every
student
in
grades
3
and
4
from
all
three
zones
to
this
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
it
means
sending
both
blacks
and
whites.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
there
are
blacks
and
whites
in
this
zone
and
there
are,
there
are
45
black
students
along
with
500
white
students
in
this
school.
you
arbitrarily
take
every
first
and
second
grader
in
this
school,
black
or
white
and
bused
him
up
here
to
this
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
think
that’s
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
from
necessity,
it
would.
in
this
case,
there’s
a
three
corner
of
pairing
three
students.
the
first
grader
would
perhaps
go
here,
the
third
grader
would
go
13
miles
by
bus
here,
and
the
fifth
grader
would
go
9
miles
by
bus
here.
most
of
the
pairings
are
two
students
but
there
are
two
or
three
instances
of
three-cornered
pairings
and
some
of
this
plan
that
hew
has
proposed
to
deal
with
this
problem
the
five
reasons.
i’ll
give
you
an
example
of
that,
the
will
and
whistler
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
community,
a
separate
community
at
one
time.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it’s
in
the
city
of
prichard
at
this
time.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
metropolitan
mobile
which
includes
the
city
of
mobile,
the
city
of
prichard,
and
the
city
of
chickasaw.
whistler
here
and
is
labeled
wilmer
on
the
map,
the
students
actually
will,
wilmer
the
community
of
the
county.
it’s
roughly
9
miles
between
the
two
schools.
wilmer
or
will
was
once
an
all-white
school
zone
or
school,
as
to
whistler
was
once
an
all-white
school.
the
enrollment
now
at
will
is
652
white
and
160
black.
the
enrollment
at
whistler
is
227
white
and
160
black,
both
schools
with
a
160
black
students.
one
with
227
white,
one
with
652
white,
and
yet,
you
bus
them
back
and
forth.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no
sir,
it’s
not,
it’s
in
plan
b
one
alternative
drawn
by
hew
which
petitioner
is
urging.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
this
is
what
the
petitioner
has
asked
pendente
lite.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no
sir,
these
are
the
lines
at
hew.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no
sir,
that’s
what
hew
do.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
right,
another
example
of
this
is
thomas
and
whitley.
it
is
thomas
and
whitley.
most
of
these
were
at
one
time
all-negro
schools.
thomas
is
now
--
has
74
black
students
and
160
white.
whitley
has
345
black
students
and
127
white.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
of
course
we
asked
that
it
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
formulation
of
a
plan
in
light
of
certain
principles
which
we
hope
would
eliminate
some
very
grossly
gerrymandered
zones
that
i
may
be
able
to
get
to
in
later
portion
of
the
argument
upon
i
may
not.
i’d
like
now
to
respond
to
the
question
that’s
been
raised
a
couple
of
times
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
others
and
that
is
with
reference
to
the
necessity
of
the
court
to
continue
to
balance
schools
once
we
move
to
a
purely
result-oriented
constitutional
theory.
and
i
suggest
to
you
this,
absent
the
power
of
the
court
to
force
people
to
attend
public
school
and
i
might
mention
to
you
that
there
is
no
applicable
requirement
that
by
law
that
a
student
attend
to
school
in
mobile
county,
alabama,
there’s
no
compulsory
attendance
law.
absent
the
power
of
the
court
to
force
people
to
attend
public
school
and
absent
the
power
of
the
court
to
restrict
all
people,
black
or
white,
rich
or
poor,
in
the
movement
of
their
residence,
then
the
court
will
forever
and
eternal
in
the
business
and
the
process
of
balancing.
the
balancing
process
can
never
end.
what
better
example
of
this
could
i
give
you
than
the
supplemental
brief
filed
by
petitioner
the
day
before
yesterday?
a
quote
from
the
report
in
the
brief
where
they
report
to
set
out
the
student’s
assigned
by
the
court
order
that
is
here
attached.
the
report
shows
that
there
are
11,000
and
i’m
quoting,
the
report
shows
that
“there
are
11,894
black
elementary
students
in
metropolitan
mobile.
the
percentage
of
those
assigned
to
all
black
schools
is
64%.
then
they
proceed
to
list
these
enrollment
figures.
they
do
not
draw
the
distinction
between
those
assigned
by
the
court
and
those
actually
enrolled.
the
figures
they
quote
are
those
enrolled,
not
those
assigned
by
the
court
order
as
a
consequence
of
the
court
order.
and
so,
we
get
back
to
the
figures
i
quoted
before
of
blount
high
school
where
the
court
assigned
1233
blacks,
1041
whites,
and
it
comes
out
an
all-black
school
with
41
whites
enrolled
and
2033
blacks
enrolled.
while
washington
junior
high
school
where
the
court
assigned
780
blacks,
636
whites,
there
are
809
blacks
and
59
whites
enrolled,
and
the
same
thing
appears
throughout.
when
this
litigation
first
began
in
1963
as
i
described,
there’s
no
question
but
what
we
had
in
dual
school
system.
but
this
dual
school
system
has
been
disestablished.
in
1967,
after
a
flow
of
evidentiary
hearing,
the
district
court
in
an
exhaustive
opinion
and
finding
effect
after
hearing
and
spending
some
four
weeks
found
and
stated
that
the
dual
system
had
been
disestablished
in
every
particular
prescribed
by
the
courts
except
the
element
of
faculty
and
student
assignment.
now,
there
has
been
no
finding
to
the
contrary
by
any
court
since
that
time,
now
that
covers
transportation,
athletics,
extracurricular
activities,
facilities,
activities
and
programs.
this
finding
was
reconfirmed
as
late
as
the
june
9,
1970
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
two
areas
labeled
as
deficient
by
the
district
court
in
1967
of
faculty
assignment
and
student
assignment.
these
are
since
been
rectified.
the
faculty
by
the
assignment
of
teachers,
so
as
to
create
a
biracial
faculty
in
every
student
of
the
system
but
two,
two
years
ago
in
every
school
of
the
system
but
one
last
year
and
that
one
i
might
mention
is
a
school
isolated
on
dauphin
island
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
with
20
white
students
in
the
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
and
only
one
teacher.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
hardly
think
so.[laughter]
this
year
of
course,
in
order
comply
with
the
order
of
the
court
which
requires
a
60:40
racial
balance
in
every
school
in
the
system
among
the
faculty.
the
personnel
department
has
been
engaged
in
a
tragic
comic
game
of
fruit
basket
turnover
in
order
to
try
to
meet
this
requirement
of
60%
white
faculty
and
40%
black
faculty
in
every
student
system.
but
we
have
come
up
to
the
terms
of
the
order,
give
or
take
a
few
in
our
brief
are
listed
the
actual
faculty
assignments
for
the
year
including
the
number
of
assignments
yet
to
be
made
in
order
to
reach
the
ratio.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes.
it’s
not
in
the
record
because
it’s
come
so
late.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
enrolment
figures
are
of
october
the
2nd.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
it
will
disclose
within
reason
because
we
won’t
be
able
to
locate
each
one
but
we
know
where
many
of
them
are.
for
example,
if
you
total
up
the
difference
between
the
assigned
students,
assigned
by
the
court
order
and
those
enrolled,
you
come
to
a
total
of
approximately
2000
or
2500
as
i
recall
them.
i
may
be
wrong
in
my
figure.
i
think
it’s
around
2500.
the
total
enrolment
is
down
from
last
year
over
4000
so
we
know
within
a
reason
that
many
of
these
missing
students
are
within
this
4000
who
simply
did
not
reenroll
in
public
school
this
year.
we
know
others
have
changed
their
residence.
we
know
others
have
been
granted
transfers.
we
know
others
were
simply
are
not
going
to
school
this
year.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
the
transfer
policy
is
set
out
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
the
transfer
of
policies
specifies
transfers.
first,
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
of
provision
requiring
that
you
furnish
transportation
and
guarantee
in
priorities
respects.
this
was
required
first
by
the
district
court
and
reaffirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
other
transfer
of
provision
is
in
order
to
obtain
a
course
of
study
not
available
at
the
school
where
you
attend
and
the
other
is
for
any
good
cause,
non-racial
in
character
and
while
we’re
on
transfer
as
i
might
mention
this.
this
year,
we
received
approximately
3600
transfer
applications
where
the
normal
number
runs
between
400
and
600
each
year.
it’s
surprising
the
number
of
transfer
applications
which
attacks
a
doctor’s
certificate
attesting
to
the
need
of
transfer
of
the
child
into
a
stable
school
in
order
to
maintain
or
what
is
worst,
to
regain
the
physical
and
mental
well-being
of
the
child.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
runs
because
the
proportion
of
white
and
black
students
in
the
system
is
approximately
60%
white
and
40%
black.
i
think
the
transfer
has
run
as
much
as
80%
white
and
20%
black
but
i
would
not
wish
to
be
held
to
that
figure
because
this
is
just
my
recollection.
i
did
not
comment
on
this
in
my
brief
and
i
don’t
have
the
exact
figure.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
quite
a
few
that
would
fall
into
that
category.
if
i
might
get
into
that,
if
i
can
get
the
clerk
to
help
me
move
this
map
and
get
the
other
map.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes.
sir?
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
the
map
i’m
going
to
get
to
will
be
the
junior
high
zones
that
are
now
in
the
implementations
as
drawn
by
the
court.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
court
drew
the
zones.
these
are
the
junior
high
zones.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
hew
zones.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
hew?
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor
the
hew
zones
were
drawn
by
hew
experts,
one
from
washington,
one
from
north
carolina
and
one
from
miami,
florida.
these
zones
were
fashioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
of
course
the
district
judge
is
a
resident
of
mobile.
these
are
the
junior
high
zones.
if
you’ll
look
at
central
junior
high
school,
the
zone
is
a
long,
narrow
zone
running
diagonally
from
northeast
to
southwest.
central
junior
high
school,
which
is
right
here,
was
once
a
high
school
but
by
the
court
was
this
year
to
reduce
to
junior
high
school.
the
two
other
junior
high
schools
near
the
tip
of
the
zone,
eanes
and
hall.
both
are
integrated
junior
high
schools.
students
down
in
this
very
tip
of
the
zone
are
within
walking
distance
of
eanes
and
hall.
they
are
roughly
4
miles
from
the
central,
diagonally
across
the
heaviest
traffic
part
of
the
city
of
mobile,
this
being
the
central
city
of
mobile
lying
on
the
river.
many
of
these
students
that
are
not
going
to
school
and
central
is
one
that’s
in
the
figures
that
you’ll
find
where
231
white
students
and
1563
negro
students
were
assigned
and
1508
negro
students
and
17
white
students
enrolled.
many
of
these
students
simply
can’t
get
to
central.
the
court
drew
the
zones
and
mr.
justice
black
directed
his
question
towards
busing.
the
court
didn’t
say
busing.
the
court
simply
drew
zones
and
leave
them
to
get
there
as
they
will.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
this
is

thank
you,

mr.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
we
begin
our
argument
time,
we
have
some
maps
on
an
easel
that
we
could
not
bring
in
because
of
the
admission
ceremonies
which
we
need
to
bring
it
now.
it
will
make
a
moment.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
wait.
your
honor,
we
have
another.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
board
of
school
commissioners
of
mobile
county.
my
client
was
the
defendant
and
the
appellee
below
and
it’s
a
respondent
here.
i’m
advised
by
the
clerk
that
i
have
45
minutes
time
for
argument
plus
to
share
this
with
another
respondent,
the
parent-teacher
association.
so
i
will
attempt
to
limit
my
argument
to
not
more
than
30
minutes.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
we
asked
that
the
judgment
be
overturned
and
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
the
formulation
of
a
new
plan
within
the
light
of
certain
principles
that
we
hope
the
court
would
reaffirm.
although
i’m
press
for
time
to
present
my
own
argument,
several
assertions
made
by
the
petitioner
yesterday
should
not
go
unanswered,
so
i
will
rejoin
just
briefly.
petitioner
stated
that
the
school
board
has
changed
its
people
assignment
plan
from
year
to
year
and
sometimes
more
frequently.
may
i
remind
the
court
that
since
august
1966,
this
school
system
has
each
year
received
an
order
of
the
court
requiring
a
new
or
change
desegregation
plan.
but
since
1967,
the
student
assignment
portions
of
these
plans
have
been
devised
by
someone
other
than
the
school
board,
either
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
hew
of
the
department
of
justice.
since
january
1970,
we
have
been
ordered
to
implement
six
different
plans
of
student
assignment
in
the
desegregation
process
is
not
the
board
that
has
been
changing
the
plan.
they
are
merely
attempting
to
the
best
of
their
ability
to
carry
out
the
orders
of
the
court.
petitioner
in
its
argument
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
well,
they
are
different
from
one
another.
they
take
different
approaches.
they
draw
different
zones,
one

petitioner
has
framed
its
argument
procedurally
in
terms
of
results,
not
the
constitution
but
results.
so
let
me
show
you
something
of
result.
craighead
school
listed
on
mr.
greenberg’s
map
is
76%
black.
this
in
the
time
of
the
dual
school
system
was
an
all-white
school.
lienkauf
64%
black
at
one
time
an
all-white
school.
old
shell
road
80%
black
at
one
time
an
all-white
school.
palmer
at
one
time
an
all-white
school,
now
listed
by
mr.
greenberg
is
all-black.
glendale
at
one
time
an
all-white
school,
now
listed
by
mr.
greenberg
at
70%
black,
the
same
pattern
goes
through
out.
thomas
62%
white
once
an
all-black
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that’s
the
divided.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
think
east
of
the
divider,
is
roughly
60%
black,
40%
white.
west
is
roughly
70%
white
and
30%
black.
so
this
is
some
of
the
results
if
we
wish
to
frame
things
in
terms
of
results
rather
than
in
terms
of
complying
with
the
constitutional
mandate.
now,
let’s
turn
to
a
moment
to
another
question
that
was
raised
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
fact
that
busing
to
preserve
segregation
occurred
in
the
past
and
this
is
freely
admitted
in
the
brief.
they
point
two
examples
of
busing
for
example
where
the
students
in
this
area
which
is
in
the
rural
area
and
i
might
remind
the
court
that
this
is
a
map
of
metropolitan
mobile,
prichard
and
chickasaw,
three
cities
with
co-terminus
boundary
lines.
this
is
roughly
18
miles
north
to
south
and
13
miles
from
east
to
west.
the
county
itself
is
53
miles
from
north
to
south
and
27
miles
east
to
west,
from
the
river
to
the
mississippi
line
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
north.
with
reference
to
the
bus,
students
carried
from
these
area
black
students
bused
to
this
area
four
or
five
years
ago
into
this
school.
unquestionably
this
occurred,
but
these
students
are
no
longer
bused
and
have
not
been
bused
for
four
or
five
years.
how
can
it
be
contended
that
there’s
any
effect
left
from
the
dual
system
as
a
result
of
busing
30
students
from
here
to
here
five
years
ago?
certainly,
it
was
in
effect
at
that
time
but
we’re
dealing
with
a
presently
existing
effect
of
the
once
dual
system.
the
same
thing
occurs
with
reference
to
split
zones
of
nine
contiguous
zones
as
petitioner
referred
to
yesterday.
with
reference
to
the
whistler
and
thomas
schools
indicating
the
fact
that
one
time
thomas
an
all-negro
schools
questioned
an
all-white
school
and
people
from
this
area
whereas
the
time
there
was
no
school
went
pass
to
the
thomas
school
to
the
whistler
school.
there
again,
this
occurred
four
or
five
years
ago.
where
can
it
be
any
present
existing
effect
from
this
as
it
exist
now
when
you
consider
that
thomas,
which
was
once
the
all-negro
school
is
now
62%
white
and
has
been
for
two
school
terms
predominantly
white.
and
whistler,
which
was
at
one
time
all
white
is
now
52%
white
although
last
year
it
was
predominantly
negro.
petitioner
has
stated
that
mobile
has
never
adhered
to
the
neighborhood
school
concept.
this
is
incorrect
and
i
must
adopt
at
least
in
the
part
of
the
language
of
the
solicitor
general
with
reference
to
the
misconception
with
reference
to
the
clichés
or
seizing
upon
words
such
as
the
neighborhood
skill
concept.
as
the
record
will
show,
the
mobile
school
system
has
always
adhered
to
and
favored
the
neighborhood
school’s
concept
based
upon
specific
geographic
zones
except
when
ordered
by
the
court
to
do
otherwise.
admittedly,
prior
to
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system,
at
one
time
they
existed
that
the
dual
zones,
overlapping
zones,
one
zone
for
black,
one
zone
for
white,
superimposed
upon
one
another.
this
has
been
disestablished
and
was
disestablished
as
much
as
four
years
ago
by
the
simple
elimination
of
both
zones
redrawing
the
zone
around
each
school,
a
unitary
zone
so
that
every
person,
black
or
white
goes
to
the
school
within
the
zone
regardless
of
the
present
or
past
racial
makeup
of
the
school.
admittedly,
prior
to
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
system,
there
were
these
overlapping
zones
but
they
no
longer
exist
and
it
should
be
observed
in
its
adherence
to
the
neighborhood
school
concept
as
a
concept.
the
mobile
board
opposed
freedom
of
choice
when
this
first
concept
looked
upon
as
apparently
a
panacea,
which
didn’t
pan
out
first
came
upon
the
scene.
admittedly,
several
years
after
the
freedom
of
choice
concept,
which
was
foreign
to
the
mobile
school
system
came
upon
the
public
saying
that
board’s
republic
pressure
was
forced
into
asking
the
court
for
freedom
of
choice.
but
we
have
never
had
freedom
of
choice
in
the
mobile
public
school
system
except
when
it
was
specifically
requested
by
motion
of
the
justice
department
for
a
freedom
of
choice
in
the
rural
portion
of
the
system.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
when
the
freedom
of
choice?
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
now
i
think
it
was
--
i
think
it
came
in
the
decree
of
the
district
court
in
july
and
august
1968.
the
district
court
entered
a
decree
on
july
the
29th
pursuant
to
the
motion
to
amend
by
the
justice
department
at
the
end
of
the
supplemental
decree
on
august
the
2nd,
three
days
later.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
hear
that.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
--
it
was
a
jefferson-type
freedom
of
choice
allowing
the
pupil
above
a
certain
age
or
for
the
younger
pupils,
the
parent
should
exercise
its
choice
in
his
behalf.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
wide
open
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
it
was
full
freedom
of
choice
within
the
terms
of
freedom
of
choice
specified
by
the
jefferson
decree.
if
you
recall
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
jefferson,
spelled
out
very
specifically
and
minutely
a
method
of
applying
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
and
this
was
adopted
by
the
district
court,
and
ordered
for
implementation
in
the
portion
of
the
system.
even
there,
the
freedom
of
choice
was
limited
to
the
rural
portion
of
the
system,
which
is
not
shown
here.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
certainly
pointed
out
from
the
standpoint
to
show
that
we
--
the
school
board
in
adhering
to
its
favoritism
for
the
neighborhood
school
concept
even
opposed
that
at
that
time,
it
was
placed
upon.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
what
i
understand
[voice
overlap]
but
you
obsess
them
to
me.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
it
was
in
fact
--
it
was
at
that
time,
on
a
dual
system,
a
dual
set
of
zones
but
we
have
disestablished
the
dual
system,
we
have
disestablished
the
dual
zones.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
in
every
area.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
of
the
city.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
and
the
county.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
as
i
recall,
we
have
seven
schools
that
are
literally
all-black
or
all-white,
two
of
them,
all-black
and
five
all-white.
this
is
throughout
the
entire
system.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
eighty-three
schools.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
believe
--
i
believe
they’re
all
five,
yes
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
two
all-black
schools
are
within
the
city.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
one
is
brazier.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
and
the
other,
i
think
is
grant.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
it’s
grant
but
i’m
not
that
certain
that
set
out
in
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
supplemental
brief
for
the
petitioners.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
its
brazier
and
owens.
they
are
black
in
my
judgment
because
--
well,
if
you’ll
notice
brazier,
it’s
difficult
to
see
if
you
can
observe
this
district.
it’s
bounded
on
the
western
edge
by
the
beltline
of
federal
interstate
highway.
the
zone
is
rather
symmetrical
the
school
is
on
the
far
edge
of
the
beltline.
no
matter
how
far
you
extend
this
zone,
this
is
a
predominantly
black
school
and
predominantly
for
all-black
school
enlisted
by
mr.
greenberg.
this
was
once
an
all-white
school
but
it’s
now
all
black,
an
all-black
school.
and
this
school
which
was
once
all
white
and
is
67%
white
now.
so
it’s
(inaudible)
by
the
beltline
of
one
side
and
essentially,
by
all
black
areas
on
the
other.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
think
they
are
your
honor.
i
think
they
are.
i’m
not
aware
of
any
white
students
living
in
the
zone.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that
is
right.
i
said
literally
all
black.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
that’s
correct.
let
me
call
your
attention
to

of

mr.

your
honor,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
have
bad
ideas
to
that.
we
know
as
the
record
has
indicated
and
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief,
this
school
system,
since
1965,
when
the
population
of
mobile
has
increased
constantly
and
the
school
age
population
even
more
proportionate.
while
the
population
has
continued
to
increase
since
1965,
the
school
enrollment
has
gone
down.
we’re
now
some
10,000
students
less
than
we
had
in
1965.
we
know
that
many
of
the
students
have
enrolled
in
private
school.
we
know
that
many
of
these
students
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
blount
zone
as
assigned
by
the
court
have
simply
moved
their
residence,
some
within
this
county,
some
to
other
places,
perhaps
some
to
other
parts
of
the
country
that
have
not
yet
faced
this
problem.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
they’re
all
before
the
court
in
this
respect.
in
my
brief,
i
have
a
chart
at
page
7,
which
shows
the
assigned
enrollments
according
to
the
assignment
made
by
the
court.
in
the
supplemental
brief
of
petitioner,
they
set
out
the
enrollment
as
of
october
2nd.
in
1963,
when
the
desegregation
litigation
first
began
in
the
school
system,
it
was
in
both
at
legal
and
a
practical
sense,
a
dual
school
system.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
hew
and
the
justice
department
along
with
the
school
board
have
struggled
with
that
problem
for
three
or
four
years
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
do
it.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
even
to
close
the
school
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
even
to
close
the
school,
and
we
have
closed
during
the
process
of
this
litigation,
12
to
16
schools,
12
which
were
all
black
at
one
time
in
an
effort
to
eliminate
all
black
schools.
the
only
other
solution
they
suggest
is
to
pick
out
the
white
or
near
all-white
school
and
cross
bus.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
i’m
right,
i’ll
use
or
another
mr.
greenberg’s
map.
an
example
of
that
is
the
thing
they
would
do
with
thomas
school
and
whitley
school.
this
is
the
plan
drawn
by
hew.
the
plan
b
one
alternative
by
which
hew
proposes
to
do
all
of
this
cross
busing,
this
is
where
every
two
or
three
attendance
areas
within
the
system
are
packed
together
for
example,
dodge,
owens,
this
is
roughly
13
miles.
williams,
they
make
the
three-corner
pairing
of
these
zones.
they
send
every
student
in
grade
1
and
2
from
all
the
three
zones,
to
one
of
these
schools
that
means,
busing
15
miles
from
here
and
here
and
9
miles
from
here
and
here.
they
send
every
student
in
grades
3
and
4
from
all
three
zones
to
this
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
it
means
sending
both
blacks
and
whites.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
there
are
blacks
and
whites
in
this
zone
and
there
are,
there
are
45
black
students
along
with
500
white
students
in
this
school.
you
arbitrarily
take
every
first
and
second
grader
in
this
school,
black
or
white
and
bused
him
up
here
to
this
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
think
that’s
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
from
necessity,
it
would.
in
this
case,
there’s
a
three
corner
of
pairing
three
students.
the
first
grader
would
perhaps
go
here,
the
third
grader
would
go
13
miles
by
bus
here,
and
the
fifth
grader
would
go
9
miles
by
bus
here.
most
of
the
pairings
are
two
students
but
there
are
two
or
three
instances
of
three-cornered
pairings
and
some
of
this
plan
that
hew
has
proposed
to
deal
with
this
problem
the
five
reasons.
i’ll
give
you
an
example
of
that,
the
will
and
whistler
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
community,
a
separate
community
at
one
time.
mr.

will
is
652
white
and
160
black.
the
enrollment
at
whistler
is
227
white
and
160
black,
both
schools
with
a
160
black
students.
one
with
227
white,
one
with
652
white,
and
yet,
you
bus
them
back
and
forth.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no
sir,
it’s
not,
it’s
in
plan
b
one
alternative
drawn
by
hew
which
petitioner
is
urging.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
this
is
what
the
petitioner
has
asked
pendente
lite.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no
sir,
these
are
the
lines
at
hew.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no
sir,
that’s
what
hew
do.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
right,
another
example
of
this
is
thomas
and
whitley.
it
is
thomas
and
whitley.
most
of
these
were
at
one
time
all-negro
schools.
thomas
is
now
--
has
74
black
students
and
160
white.
whitley
has
345
black
students
and
127
white.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
of
course
we
asked
that
it
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
formulation
of
a
plan
in
light
of
certain
principles
which
we
hope
would
eliminate
some
very
grossly
gerrymandered
zones
that
i
may
be
able
to
get
to
in
later
portion
of
the
argument
upon
i
may
not.
i’d
like
now
to
respond
to
the
question
that’s
been
raised
a
couple
of
times
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
others
and
that
is
with
reference
to
the
necessity
of
the
court
to
continue
to
balance
schools
once
we
move
to
a
purely
result-oriented
constitutional
theory.
and
i
suggest
to
you
this,
absent
the
power
of
the
court
to
force
people
to
attend
public
school
and
i
might
mention
to
you
that
there
is
no
applicable
requirement
that
by
law
that
a
student
attend
to
school
in
mobile
county,
alabama,
there’s
no
compulsory
attendance
law.
absent
the
power
of
the
court
to
force
people
to
attend
public
school
and
absent
the
power
of
the
court
to
restrict
all
people,
black
or
white,
rich
or
poor,
in
the
movement
of
their
residence,
then
the
court
will
forever
and
eternal
in
the
business
and
the
process
of
balancing.
the
balancing
process
can
never
end.
what
better
example
of
this
could
i
give
you
than
the
supplemental
brief
filed
by
petitioner
the
day
before
yesterday?
a
quote
from
the
report
in
the
brief
where
they
report
to
set
out
the
student’s
assigned
by
the
court
order
that
is
here
attached.
the
report
shows
that
there
are
11,000
and
i’m
quoting,
the
report
shows
that
“there
are
11,894
black
elementary
students
in
metropolitan
mobile.
the
percentage
of
those
assigned
to
all
black
schools
is
64%.
then
they
proceed
to
list
these
enrollment
figures.
they
do
not
draw
the
distinction
between
those
assigned
by
the
court
and
those
actually
enrolled.
the
figures
they
quote
are
those
enrolled,
not
those
assigned
by
the
court
order
as
a
consequence
of
the
court
order.
and
so,
we
get
back
to
the
figures
i
quoted
before
of
blount
high
school
where
the
court
assigned
1233
blacks,
1041
whites,
and
it
comes
out
an
all-black
school
with
41
whites
enrolled
and
2033
blacks
enrolled.
while
washington
junior
high
school
where
the
court
assigned
780
blacks,
636
whites,
there
are
809
blacks
and
59
whites
enrolled,
and
the
same
thing
appears
throughout.
when
this
litigation
first
began
in
1963
as
i
described,
there’s
no
question
but
what
we
had
in
dual
school
system.
but
this
dual
school
system
has
been
disestablished.
in
1967,
after
a
flow
of
evidentiary
hearing,
the
district
court
in
an
exhaustive
opinion
and
finding
effect
after
hearing
and
spending
some
four
weeks
found
and
stated
that
the
dual
system
had
been
disestablished
in
every
particular
prescribed
by
the
courts
except
the
element
of
faculty
and
student
assignment.
now,
there
has
been
no
finding
to
the
contrary
by
any
court
since
that
time,
now
that
covers
transportation,
athletics,
extracurricular
activities,
facilities,
activities
and
programs.
this
finding
was
reconfirmed
as
late
as
the
june
9,
1970
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
two
areas
labeled
as
deficient
by
the
district
court
in
1967
of
faculty
assignment
and
student
assignment.
these
are
since
been
rectified.
the
faculty
by
the
assignment
of
teachers,
so
as
to
create
a
biracial
faculty
in
every
student
of
the
system
but
two,
two
years
ago
in
every
school
of
the
system
but
one
last
year
and
that
one
i
might
mention
is
a
school
isolated
on
dauphin
island
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
with
20
white
students
in
the
school.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
and
only
one
teacher.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
i
hardly
think
so.[laughter]
this
year
of
course,
in
order
comply
with
the
order
of
the
court
which
requires
a
60:40
racial
balance
in
every
school
in
the
system
among
the
faculty.
the
personnel
department
has
been
engaged
in
a
tragic
comic
game
of
fruit
basket
turnover
in
order
to
try
to
meet
this
requirement
of
60%
white
faculty
and
40%
black
faculty
in
every
student
system.
but
we
have
come
up
to
the
terms
of
the
order,
give
or
take
a
few
in
our
brief
are
listed
the
actual
faculty
assignments
for
the
year
including
the
number
of
assignments
yet
to
be
made
in
order
to
reach
the
ratio.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes.
it’s
not
in
the
record
because
it’s
come
so
late.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
enrolment
figures
are
of
october
the
2nd.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
it
will
disclose
within
reason
because
we
won’t
be
able
to
locate
each
one
but
we
know
where
many
of
them
are.
for
example,
if
you
total
up
the
difference
between
the
assigned
students,
assigned
by
the
court
order
and
those
enrolled,
you
come
to
a
total
of
approximately
2000
or
2500
as
i
recall
them.
i
may
be
wrong
in
my
figure.
i
think
it’s
around
2500.
the
total
enrolment
is
down
from
last
year
over
4000
so
we
know
within
a
reason
that
many
of
these
missing
students
are
within
this
4000
who
simply
did
not
reenroll
in
public
school
this
year.
we
know
others
have
changed
their
residence.
we
know
others
have
been
granted
transfers.
we
know
others
were
simply
are
not
going
to
school
this
year.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
the
transfer
policy
is
set
out
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
the
transfer
of
policies
specifies
transfers.
first,
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
of
provision
requiring
that
you
furnish
transportation
and
guarantee
in
priorities
respects.
this
was
required
first
by
the
district
court
and
reaffirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
other
transfer
of
provision
is
in
order
to
obtain
a
course
of
study
not
available
at
the
school
where
you
attend
and
the
other
is
for
any
good
cause,
non-racial
in
character
and
while
we’re
on
transfer
as
i
might
mention
this.
this
year,
we
received
approximately
3600
transfer
applications
where
the
normal
number
runs
between
400
and
600
each
year.
it’s
surprising
the
number
of
transfer
applications
which
attacks
a
doctor’s
certificate
attesting
to
the
need
of
transfer
of
the
child
into
a
stable
school
in
order
to
maintain
or
what
is
worst,
to
regain
the
physical
and
mental
well-being
of
the
child.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
runs
because
the
proportion
of
white
and
black
students
in
the
system
is
approximately
60%
white
and
40%
black.
i
think
the
transfer
has
run
as
much
as
80%
white
and
20%
black
but
i
would
not
wish
to
be
held
to
that
figure
because
this
is
just
my
recollection.
i
did
not
comment
on
this
in
my
brief
and
i
don’t
have
the
exact
figure.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
quite
a
few
that
would
fall
into
that
category.
if
i
might
get
into
that,
if
i
can
get
the
clerk
to
help
me
move
this
map
and
get
the
other
map.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes.
sir?
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor,
the
map
i’m
going
to
get
to
will
be
the
junior
high
zones
that
are
now
in
the
implementations
as
drawn
by
the
court.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
court
drew
the
zones.
these
are
the
junior
high
zones.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
hew
zones.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
the
hew?
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
your
honor
the
hew
zones
were
drawn
by
hew
experts,
one
from
washington,
one
from
north
carolina
and
one
from
miami,
florida.
these
zones
were
fashioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
of
course
the
district
judge
is
a
resident
of
mobile.
these
are
the
junior
high
zones.
if
you’ll
look
at
central
junior
high
school,
the
zone
is
a
long,
narrow
zone
running
diagonally
from
northeast
to
southwest.
central
junior
high
school,
which
is
right
here,
was
once
a
high
school
but
by
the
court
was
this
year
to
reduce
to
junior
high
school.
the
two
other
junior
high
schools
near
the
tip
of
the
zone,
eanes
and
hall.
both
are
integrated
junior
high
schools.
students
down
in
this
very
tip
of
the
zone
are
within
walking
distance
of
eanes
and
hall.
they
are
roughly
4
miles
from
the
central,
diagonally
across
the
heaviest
traffic
part
of
the
city
of
mobile,
this
being
the
central
city
of
mobile
lying
on
the
river.
many
of
these
students
that
are
not
going
to
school
and
central
is
one
that’s
in
the
figures
that
you’ll
find
where
231
white
students
and
1563
negro
students
were
assigned
and
1508
negro
students
and
17
white
students
enrolled.
many
of
these
students
simply
can’t
get
to
central.
the
court
drew
the
zones
and
mr.
justice
black
directed
his
question
towards
busing.
the
court
didn’t
say
busing.
the
court
simply
drew
zones
and
leave
them
to
get
there
as
they
will.
mr.
abram
l.
philips,
jr.
no,
sir.
this
is
junior
high
school
beginning
with
grade
6.

you,
your
honor.
