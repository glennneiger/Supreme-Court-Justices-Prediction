mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
beginning
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
before
commenting
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
explain
one
circumstance.
the
brief
which
we
have
filed
covers
all
three
cases,
the
two
charlotte
cases
and
this
case,
and
it
says,
the
brief
for
the
united
states
says
amicus
curiae.
in
the
charlotte
cases,
we
were
amicus
curiae,
though
very
active
one
and
both
lower
courts
and
here,
but
in
this
case,
we
are
a
party.
we
have
been
a
party
plaintiff
since
1967,
and
we
appeared
here
as
a
party,
and
the
brief
should’ve
had
to
somewhat
longer
caption
amicus
curiae
in
those
cases
and
for
the
united
states
as
a
party
in
this
case.
i
should
also
like
to
make
it
plain,
though
i
assume
it
is
entirely
plain
for
what
is
going
on
that
we
do
not
support
the
board
here
and
never
have.
we
have
been
with
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here
fighting
against
the
dilatory
tactics
of
this
board
for
the
past
three
years
and
we
still
are
and
we
do
not
support
the
board
in
the
charlotte
case
and
never
had.
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
after
repeated
appearances
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
which
are
cited
in
the
memorandum,
which
we
filed
in
connection
with
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
submitted
a
plan
on
january
27,
1970,
and
this
was
in
fact
based
on
one
of
the
hew
plans
but
with
some
modifications.
and
it
was
submitted
then
as
following
these
court’s
decisions
last
term
requiring
immediate
action,
it
was
submitted
then
as
one
which
could
be
implemented
immediately
pendente
lite
to
remain
in
effect
until
the
conclusion
of
the
then
current
school
year
that
is
until
june
1970.
the
district
court
rejected
that
plan.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
expedited
procedure
and
without
oral
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
government’s
plan
into
affect
on
a
permanent
basis.
that
put
us
in
something
of
a
problem
because
it
was
our
plan,
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
approve
although
we
had
not
offered
it
as
a
permanent
plan,
we
did
not
file
a
petition
for
certiorari.
but
we
did
file
a
memorandum
with
the
court
saying
that
we
thought
that
the
decision
would
be
reviewed
and
because
the
petitioners
were
filing
a
petition,
we
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
us
to
file
a
petition,
which
would
have
involved
our
seeming
and
the
sense
at
least
to
attest
the
plan
which
we
had
filed
with
the
district
court.
now,
the
two
cases,
charlotte
and
mobile
present
perhaps
the
extremes
of
the
situations,
which
may
come
before
the
court.
in
charlotte,
the
district
judge
applied
perhaps
his
drastic
irresolution
as
possible
and
we
have
contented
that
he
may
have
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
doing
that.
here
in
mobile,
number
436,
the
court
of
appeals
has
entered
what
may
be
regarded
as
a
minimal
order
under
the
circumstances.
it
does
include
specifically
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals
a
majority
to
minority
transfer
plans
so
that
no
student
is
locked
into
any
school
where
he
is
in
the
majority
race.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
includes
in
non-segregated
busing
and
i
believe
priority
that
is
the
right
to
get
into
the
school
and
even
against
the
contention
that
there
are
no
places.
the
order
also
includes
allocation
of
teachers,
so
that
a
great
many
of
the
steps,
which
can
be
taken
to
remove
the
appearance
of
the
school
as
being
a
black
school
or
a
white
school
have
been
taken.
in
our
view,
it
promises
realistically
the
work
and
it
promises
realistically
the
work
now,
but
i
repeat,
on
a
minimal
basis.
at
the
argument
yesterday,
it
was
suggested
by
mr.
nabrit
that
our
position
here
and
our
position
in
the
charlotte
busing
cases
were
inconsistent.
we
did
not
seek
to
appear
orally
in
the
several
cases
that
we’re
argued
in
the
latter
part
of
yesterday,
but
we
did
file
briefs
and
we
do
support
the
district
court
in
the
charlotte
busing
cases,
the
three-judge
district
court,
which
held
in
the
north
carolina
statute
unconstitutional
numbers
444
and
498.
but
i
believe
that
our
positions
in
these
cases
are
consistent.
our
position
here
and
there
is
that
the
constitution
requires
disestablishment
of
dual
school
systems
requires
that
disestablishment
of
dual
school
systems
requires
affirmative
action
to
disestablish
dual
school
systems,
no
more,
but
likewise
no
less.
in
the
bus
case
arising
the
north
carolina
statute,
numbers
444
and
498,
we
think
that
the
statute
interferes
without
objective
and
so
was
invalid.
here,
we
think
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
does
show
promise
of
eliminating
the
dual
school
system,
though
barely
so
and
thus
we
support
the
decision
below.
i
think
that
this
point
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
surely,
the
problems
are
very
complex
and
highly
interrelated.
i
think
it
is
possible
to
post
their
argument
in
a
form
which
says
that
the
schools
are
not
disestablished
until
no
black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
black
school
at
any
grade
level,
which
is
the
position
for
which
they
contend.
our
position
is
that
that
is
not
required,
that
it
is
required
to
not
merely
to
eliminate
any
discrimination
now
which
is
what
the
north
carolina
statute
does,
if
we
were
starting
out
a
new
with
a
clean
slate
and
we’re
writing
a
picture
for
what
america
ought
to
be,
we
might
well
include
the
north
carolina
statute
in
it.
but
the
statute
was
interposed
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
great
deal
of
history
and
a
great
many
practical
consequences
and
we
think
that
the
statute
interferes
with
actions,
which
must
be
taken
in
order
to
disestablish
what
had
clearly
been
an
existing
dual
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
let
me
start
with
a
slightly
different
example
which
i
want
to
use
in
my
answer.
suppose
we
had
a
school
system,
where
there
was
absolutely
no
trace
of
any
prior
discrimination,
no
dual
school
system
ever,
nothing
with
respect
to
public
housing
or
restrictive
covenants
or
anything
else.
and
we
find
that
in
this
system,
a
lot
of
people
of
german
descent
come
to
this
community
and
a
lot
of
people
have
slovak
descent
had
come
to
this
community,
and
a
lot
of
negroes
are
living
here
although
negroes
are
living
elsewhere.
and
in
that
community,
we
find
a
school
which
is
all
or
90%
black,
i
would
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
that
there’d
be
any
change
in
that
situation.
in
other
words,
if
you
can
find
a
place
where
there
is
no
past
history
of
discrimination,
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
can
be
found
in
the
general
language
of
the
equal
protection
laws
or
the
dual
process
laws
which
supports
the
position
that
no
black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identified
school
at
any
grade.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
yes,
i
would
certainly
rule
out
any
present
--
i
would,
if
there
is
any
present
discrimination
or
past
discrimination,
then
steps
must
be
taken
to
eliminating,
and
how
extensive,
how
drastic
those
steps
are.
it
seems
to
me
depend
on
two
things,
(a)
on
the
one
hand,
the
need,
the
extent
to
which
there
has
been
past
discrimination
and
the
effect
of
that
still
continues
which
is
very
great
in
mobile
and
certainly
considerable
in
charlotte.
and
on
the
other
hand,
on
this
problem
on
which
we
haven’t
been
able
to
find
a
word
and
i
have
no
doubt
to
never
will
be
exactly
one
word,
reasonable,
feasible,
absolutely
unworkable.
i
think
absolutely
unworkable
is
too
strong,
i
seize
upon
feasible
because
i
thought
it
will
just
considerably
stronger
word
than
reasonable,
but
it
ought
to
be
explained
with
words
which
indicate
that
strong
action
is
required
to
eliminate
past
discrimination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
that
is
clear
provided
in
the
null,
you
subsumed
everything
that
has
happened
in
the
past
in
which
has
its
effect
null.
and
there
is
undoubted,
there
is
obviously
enormous
amounts
of
that
effect
in
mobile
and
a
great
deal
of
it
in
charlotte,
and
to
eliminate
discrimination
now,
you
have
to
take
steps
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
that
past
discrimination.
in
my
view,
it
is
not
enough
to
say,
well,
we’ll
leave
things
just
as
they
are,
but
from
now
on,
we’ll
be
good.
that
seems
to
me
not
to
take
the
steps
which
this
court
has
long
indicated
beginning
in
cooper
and
aaron
and
then
green
and
montgomery
county
must
be
taken
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
which
effects
are
effective
null.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
has
to
be
some
intention
to
race
paid
in
the
process
of
eliminating
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
basis
of
race,
yes
mr.
justice.
but
the
touchstone
is
we
submit
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
if
that
something
which
was
done
wrong
in
the
past
has
a
persistent
and
continuing
effect
which
is
present
on
the
scene
now,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
action
must
be
taken
to
negative
that
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that’s
required
by
--
i
think
that
bridge
has
been
caused
long
past
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
actions
must
be
taken
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
that’s
green,
that’s
montgomery
county,
in
green,
the
statute
on
its
face
is
utterly
nondiscriminatory.
but
actually,
it
doesn’t
work
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
the
court
held
it
invalid.
in
montgomery
county,
the
court
held
that
teachers
must
be
assigned
because
of
race.
we
supported
that.
i
was
consulting
the
case.
the
court
adopted
it,
and
i
hadn’t
suppose
there
was
any
ground
to
question
that
actions
must
be
taken
now
based
on
race
in
order
to
eliminate
effects
of
past
discrimination,
and
we
support
that
position.
it’s
only
a
question
really
of
how
far
that
has
to
go.
this
it
seems
to
us
is
what
the
court
ordered
onto
the
constitution
in
brown.
it’s
what
the
court
spelled
out
in
green
and
montgomery
county
and
it
is
the
standard
which
should
be
applied
here.
there
is
today
as
always
a
tendency
for
legal
thinking
to
be
too
much
dominated
by
clichés.
perhaps
this
is
true
about
racial
balance.
there
is
likewise
i
think
the
possibility
of
great
misunderstanding
in
the
talk
about
neighborhood
schools.
for
what
is
worth
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
find
the
phrase,
neighborhood
schools
in
our
brief.
you
will
find
neighborhood
and
you
will
find
schools,
and
perhaps
this
is
just
a
quibble.
but
that
phrase
is
used
by
some
persons
as
a
subterfuge
for
maintaining
segregation
and
i’ve
seen
that
in
my
own
area
of
our
country.
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
applied
in
bad
faith,
it
can
work
out
that
way.
i
have
no
doubt
for
example
that
if
were
applied
in
mobile
without
any
court
supervision
that
it
would
work
out
that
way.
and
i
am
not
appearing
for
such
a
conception
of
the
neighborhood
school.
as
the
president
said
in
his
statement
of
march
24,
1970,
“while
the
dual
school
system
is
the
most
obvious
example,
the
jury
segregation
has
also
found
in
more
subtle
forms
where
authorities
have
deliberately
drawn
attendant
zones
or
chosen
school
locations
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
creating
and
maintaining
racially
separate
schools,
the
jury
segregation
has
held
to
exist.”
in
such
cases,
the
school
board
has
a
positive
duty
to
remedy
it.
this
is
so
even
though
the
board
ostensibly
operates
a
unitary
system.
and
in
the
same
statement,
the
president
said
in
referring
to
executive
action,
“the
neighborhood
school
will
be
deemed
the
most
appropriate
base
for
such
a
system.”
note
that
he
said
base.
he
did
not
mean
that
it
was
the
sole
method
or
the
sole
requirement.
many
methods
are
available
and
our
evidence
in
the
record
in
these
cases
which
will
serve
to
eliminate
or
minimize
the
consequences
of
past
official
conduct.
thus,
there
can
be
truly
impartial
zones,
there
can
be
pairing
of
schools,
and
this
was
particularly
relevant
in
the
smaller
communities
which
previously
had
dual
systems
with
two
schools.
that
was
true
in
new
kent
county,
you
have
a
black
school
and
you
have
a
white
school.
it’s
easy
to
eliminate
the
dual
schools
system
by
saying
one
school
will
take
grades
one
to
four,
the
other
school
will
take
grades
five
to
eight.
and
there
can
be
closing
of
some
schools
and
expanding
of
others,
and
there
can
be
satellite
pairing
when
the
distances
are
not
too
great
and
when
the
corridor
is
not
a
clear
jury
mandate.
and
of
course,
there
must
be
proper
allocation
of
faculty,
and
there
must
be
elimination
of
discrimination
in
busing
and
in
athletics
and
activities.
all
of
these
things
can
be
done
and
should
be
done
as
far
as
feasible
in
order
to
eliminate
the
consequences
of
past
discrimination.
school
boards
are
making
decisions
all
the
time.
they
will
not
have
done
enough
if
they
simply
established
properly
designated
neighborhood
schools.
they
are
making
decisions
daily,
short
range
and
long
range.
they
ought
to
be
required
when
they
make
decisions
to
make
the
choice,
which
will
tend
to
overcome
segregation.
the
decision
making
process
cannot
be
used
to
perpetuate
segregation.
what
schools
are
you
going
to
expand?
what
programs
are
you
going
to
promote?
all
of
these
things
must
be
properly
handled
and
are
required
in
addition
to
the
basic
concept
of
having
children,
especially
small
children,
go
to
school
within
a
feasible
distance
of
their
own
homes.
now
turning
to
another
matter,
there’s
been
some
reference
in
these
arguments
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
provision
which
congress
included
there
with
respect
to
busing.
that
was
in
section
407
(a)
of
that
act
and
the
section
specifically
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
institute
for
or
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
say
civil
action
for
relief,
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says
provided
that
nothing
herein,
nothing
herein
is
the
key
word
of
that
provision,
shall
empower
any
official
or
court
of
the
united
states
to
require
busing
to
achieve
racial
balance.
well,
this
is
not
a
suit
by
the
attorney
general
under
section
407
(a),
there
is
no
provision
in
that
statute
or
in
any
other
statute
because
somewhat
similar
things
have
been
enacted
as
riders
on
hew
appropriation
act
which
take
away
any
powers
which
the
courts
otherwise
have.
all
that
this
statute
does
is
to
make
it
plain
that
that
statute
does
not
add
to
any
authorities
what
the
court
might
otherwise
have.
or
let
me
put
it
another
way,
it
makes
it
plain
that
congress
is
not
under
that
statute
making
an
enactment
under
section
4
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
requires
or
specifically
authorizes
that
that
kind
of
busing
be
done.
i
think
that
the
statutory
acts
in
both
here
and
in
the
appropriation
acts
is
relevant
simply
because
it
indicates
that
congress
has
not
sought
an
extension
to
require
busing
to
achieve
racial
balance
which
in
my
opinion,
though
it’s
not
here
and
i
haven’t
fully
considered
it
and
it
isn’t
brief.
but
in
my
opinion
is
now
advised,
congress
could
in
exercising
its
powers
under
section
4
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
all
i
think
that
that
statutory
language
means
is
that
congress
has
not
exercised
such
powers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
a
court
can
require
a
busing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
can
require
busing
where
it
is
needed
in
order
to
provide
the
remedy
to
disestablish
the
present
consequences
of
past
discrimination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
don’t.
that’s
simply
a
question
of
the
court
fashioning
a
remedy
to
meet
the
right
which
had
has
established
in
the
brown
case
and
several
subsequent
decisions.
the
right
not
be
discriminated
against
and
that
includes
not
only
present
enactments
but
the
application
of
present
official
decisions
to
fact
circumstances
which
arose
out
of
past
situations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
massachusetts
did
until
1849.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
find
it
hard
to
answer
that
question
without
knowing
more
about
the
facts,
knowing
how
persistent
the
consequences
had
been,
i
would
think
the
chances
were
very
great
that
it
had
washed
out,
but
i
can
conceive
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
how
far
back
mr.
justice.
i
think
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
effect
of
the
past
discrimination
persist
to
any
substantial
extent
that
that
is
relevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
certainly
in
the
charlotte
case
and
i
believe
it’s
in
the
mobile
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
some
of
those
things
are
somewhat
attenuated
just
as
the
historical
instance
of
justice
stewart
has
given,
and
if
you
had
only
those
and
no
more.
the
court
might
say
well
there’s
a
stream
of
history
and
it
isn’t
(inaudible)
not
much
of
what
it’s
left,
but
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
it
is
something
that
has
to
be
considered
and
evaluated
and
passed
upon.
i
don’t
say
that
the
mere
existence
of
it
alone
is
its
efficient
basis
for
a
present
remedy.
now,
there
are
a
couple
of
other
points
to
which
i
should
like
to
refer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
washington?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
state
of
washington.
oh!
excuse
me.
[laughter]
i
though
you
meant
that
it’s
what
you
come
out
of
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
mr.
justice
if
it
could
be
shown
that
schools
had
been
specifically
located
to
deal
with
these
particular
groups
and
for
that
purpose,
i
think
there
might
be
something
which
would
provide
a
basis
for
a
remedy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
mr.
justice,
it
would
be
de
jure
because
the
decision
that
placed
the
school
there
was
state
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
right
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
it
was
discriminatory
action
on
account
of
race.
the
effects
of
which
may
still
persist.
now,
i
would
like
in
the
short
time
remaining
to
make
reference
to
two
further
factors
to
which
very
little
has
reference
has
been
paid
here.
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
very
important.
the
first
is
the
problem
of
re-segregation,
a
great
deal
of
effort
has
been
expended
and
trying
to
desegregate
schools
in
many
parts
of
the
country
in
north
and
south
and
it
is
constantly
disrupted
because
of
movements
of
population
and
withdrawal
from
schools
going
into
private
schools
which
i
supposed
the
district
of
columbia
declared
some
most
familiar
examples.
mr.
greenberg
said
yesterday
that
under
his
plan
in
three
years,
everything
would
be
straightened
out.
i
can
guarantee
that
it
won’t
be.
under
his
plan,
there
will
be
in
any
city,
there
will
be
shifts
and
adjustments
and
it
will
have
to
be
followed.
one
of
the
problems,
it
seems
to
me
in
this
area
is
not
to
require
too
much.
if
you
require
too
much,
you
aggravate
the
problems
of
movement
and
withdrawal.
if
you
set
up
a
system
which
provides
a
good
deal
of
elimination
of
past
discrimination
and
provide
some
hope
that
it
might
be
reasonably
stable,
you
may
achieve
a
great
deal
more
in
the
long
run
than
if
you
adopt
the
standard
which
counsel
for
the
petitioners
have
advanced.
and
then,
there
is
another
aspect,
this
is
the
problem
which
is
even
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
they
talked
about
it
and
i’m
not
qualified
to
respond
to
the
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
have
read
about
that
as
a
member
of
the
civil
rights
commission.
i
have
read
about
it
as
a
citizen.
i
see
it,
there
certainly
comes
a
place
when
the
white
fleeing
exonerated
or
becomes
complete.
i’m
not
qualified
to
respond
to
the
question
in
any
sense
as
an
expert
or
even
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
mr.
justice
that
there
is
a
tipping
point.
what
i’m
not
qualified
to
say
is
where
it
is
and
i
suspect
that
it
vary
widely
according
to
the
circumstances
including
the
opportunities
to
get
out
either
through
moving
to
other
parts
of
the
city
or
the
use
of
private
schools.
i
would
like
to
make
reference
to
one
other
thing
which
is
black
separatism,
something
that
we
wouldn’t
began
to
learn
about
in
recent
times
and
which
many
of
us
did
not
foresee.
what’s
its
far
from
clear,
how
far
all
of
the
people
represented
by
the
petitioners
here.
i
want
to
have
what
they
seek
for
them.
maybe
they
ought
to
have
it,
maybe
it
would
be
good
certainly
in
my
view
of
the
public
to
facilitate
they’re
getting
it
whenever
they
want
it,
but
it
isn’t
clear
to
me
that
children
should
be
forced
into
schools
either
the
black
children
should
be
forced
into
schools
that
they
don’t
want
to
go
to.
i
encountered
this
first
in
connection
with
predominantly
black
law
schools
and
we
have
of
course
the
example
of
howard
university
here,
which
i
suppose
everyone
has
the
strongest
feelings
that
it
should
be
supported
in
the
united
negro
college
fund
and
other
such
things.
there
still
remains
a
problem
as
to
how
far
black
people
should
be
forced
into
these
matters.
and
so,
i
conclude
that
the
judgment
below
and
this
case
should
be
affirmed
as
an
experiment.
of
course,
it
will
have
to
be
watched
to
see
how
it
works
including
the
good
faith
of
the
board
and
the
diligence
of
the
district
court,
and
the
effects
of
supervening
events
which
will
always
be
with
us.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
didn’t
quite
say
that.
i
didn’t
say
that
all.
i
just
said
that
in
evaluating
the
standard
or
the
objective
which
is
to
be
reached
that
this
is
one
of
the
factors,
one
of
the
intangible,
immeasurable
factors
like
the
problem
of
re-segregation
that
the
district
court
surely
ought
to
take
into
account,
and
if
so,
it
seems
to
me
this
court
has
to
recognize
it
in
some
ways.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
it’s
quite
plain
that
when
the
plan
is
established,
when
it
is
adopted,
there
shouldn’t
be
no
opting
out
except
the
majority,
the
minority
transfer
which
we
have
had
in
which
we
have
provided
for.
what
i’m
talking
about
is
what
kind
of
a
plan
should
be
adopted
and
should
be
approved
and
i
think
that
it
is
relevant
to
take
into
account
in
connection
with
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
beginning
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
before
commenting
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
explain
one
circumstance.
the
brief
which
we
have
filed
covers
all
three
cases,
the
two
charlotte
cases
and
this
case,
and
it
says,
the
brief
for
the
united
states
says
amicus
curiae.
in
the
charlotte
cases,
we
were
amicus
curiae,
though
very
active
one
and
both
lower
courts
and
here,
but
in
this
case,
we
are
a
party.
we
have
been
a
party
plaintiff
since
1967,
and
we
appeared
here
as
a
party,
and
the
brief
should’ve
had
to
somewhat
longer
caption
amicus
curiae
in
those
cases
and
for
the
united
states
as
a
party
in
this
case.
i
should
also
like
to
make
it
plain,
though
i
assume
it
is
entirely
plain
for
what
is
going
on
that
we
do
not
support
the
board
here
and
never
have.
we
have
been
with
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here
fighting
against
the
dilatory
tactics
of
this
board
for
the
past
three
years
and
we
still
are
and
we
do
not
support
the
board
in
the
charlotte
case
and
never
had.
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
after
repeated
appearances
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
which
are
cited
in
the
memorandum,
which
we
filed
in
connection
with
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
submitted
a
plan
on
january
27,
1970,
and
this
was
in
fact
based
on
one
of
the
hew
plans
but
with
some
modifications.
and
it
was
submitted
then
as
following
these
court’s
decisions
last
term
requiring
immediate
action,
it
was
submitted
then
as
one
which
could
be
implemented
immediately
pendente
lite
to
remain
in
effect
until
the
conclusion
of
the
then
current
school
year
that
is
until
june
1970.
the
district
court
rejected
that
plan.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
expedited
procedure
and
without
oral
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
government’s
plan
into
affect
on
a
permanent
basis.
that
put
us
in
something
of
a
problem
because
it
was
our
plan,
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
approve
although
we
had
not
offered
it
as
a
permanent
plan,
we
did
not
file
a
petition
for
certiorari.
but
we
did
file
a
memorandum
with
the
court
saying
that
we
thought
that
the
decision
would
be
reviewed
and
because
the
petitioners
were
filing
a
petition,
we
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
us
to
file
a
petition,
which
would
have
involved
our
seeming
and
the
sense
at
least
to
attest
the
plan
which
we
had
filed
with
the
district
court.
now,
the
two
cases,
charlotte
and
mobile
present
perhaps
the
extremes
of
the
situations,
which
may
come
before
the
court.
in
charlotte,
the
district
judge
applied
perhaps
his
drastic
irresolution
as
possible
and
we
have
contented
that
he
may
have
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
doing
that.
here
in
mobile,
number
436,
the
court
of
appeals
has
entered
what
may
be
regarded
as
a
minimal
order
under
the
circumstances.
it
does
include
specifically
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals
a
majority
to
minority
transfer
plans
so
that
no
student
is
locked
into
any
school
where
he
is
in
the
majority
race.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
includes
in
non-segregated
busing
and
i
believe
priority
that
is
the
right
to
get
into
the
school
and
even
against
the
contention
that
there
are
no
places.
the
order
also
includes
allocation
of
teachers,
so
that
a
great
many
of
the
steps,
which
can
be
taken
to
remove
the
appearance
of
the
school
as
being
a
black
school
or
a
white
school
have
been
taken.
in
our
view,
it
promises
realistically
the
work
and
it
promises
realistically
the
work
now,
but
i
repeat,
on
a
minimal
basis.
at
the
argument
yesterday,
it
was
suggested
by
mr.
nabrit
that
our
position
here
and
our
position
in
the
charlotte
busing
cases
were
inconsistent.
we
did
not
seek
to
appear
orally
in
the
several
cases
that
we’re
argued
in
the
latter
part
of
yesterday,
but
we
did
file
briefs
and
we
do
support
the
district
court
in
the
charlotte
busing
cases,
the
three-judge
district
court,
which
held
in
the
north
carolina
statute
unconstitutional
numbers
444
and
498.
but
i
believe
that
our
positions
in
these
cases
are
consistent.
our
position
here
and
there
is
that
the
constitution
requires
disestablishment
of
dual
school
systems
requires
that
disestablishment
of
dual
school
systems
requires
affirmative
action
to
disestablish
dual
school
systems,
no
more,
but
likewise
no
less.
in
the
bus
case
arising
the
north
carolina
statute,
numbers
444
and
498,
we
think
that
the
statute
interferes
without
objective
and
so
was
invalid.
here,
we
think
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
does
show
promise
of
eliminating
the
dual
school
system,
though
barely
so
and
thus
we
support
the
decision
below.
i
think
that
this
point
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
surely,
the
problems
are
very
complex
and
highly
interrelated.
i
think
it
is
possible
to
post
their
argument
in
a
form
which
says
that
the
schools
are
not
disestablished
until
no
black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
black
school
at
any
grade
level,
which
is
the
position
for
which
they
contend.
our
position
is
that
that
is
not
required,
that
it
is
required
to
not
merely
to
eliminate
any
discrimination
now
which
is
what
the
north
carolina
statute
does,
if
we
were
starting
out
a
new
with
a
clean
slate
and
we’re
writing
a
picture
for
what
america
ought
to
be,
we
might
well
include
the
north
carolina
statute
in
it.
but
the
statute
was
interposed
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
great
deal
of
history
and
a
great
many
practical
consequences
and
we
think
that
the
statute
interferes
with
actions,
which
must
be
taken
in
order
to
disestablish
what
had
clearly
been
an
existing
dual
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
let
me
start
with
a
slightly
different
example
which
i
want
to
use
in
my
answer.
suppose
we
had
a
school
system,
where
there
was
absolutely
no
trace
of
any
prior
discrimination,
no
dual
school
system
ever,
nothing
with
respect
to
public
housing
or
restrictive
covenants
or
anything
else.
and
we
find
that
in
this
system,
a
lot
of
people
of
german
descent
come
to
this
community
and
a
lot
of
people
have
slovak
descent
had
come
to
this
community,
and
a
lot
of
negroes
are
living
here
although
negroes
are
living
elsewhere.
and
in
that
community,
we
find
a
school
which
is
all
or
90%
black,
i
would
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
that
there’d
be
any
change
in
that
situation.
in
other
words,
if
you
can
find
a
place
where
there
is
no
past
history
of
discrimination,
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
can
be
found
in
the
general
language
of
the
equal
protection
laws
or
the
dual
process
laws
which
supports
the
position
that
no
black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identified
school
at
any
grade.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
yes,
i
would
certainly
rule
out
any
present
--
i
would,
if
there
is
any
present
discrimination
or
past
discrimination,
then
steps
must
be
taken
to
eliminating,
and
how
extensive,
how
drastic
those
steps
are.
it
seems
to
me
depend
on
two
things,
(a)
on
the
one
hand,
the
need,
the
extent
to
which
there
has
been
past
discrimination
and
the
effect
of
that
still
continues
which
is
very
great
in
mobile
and
certainly
considerable
in
charlotte.
and
on
the
other
hand,
on
this
problem
on
which
we
haven’t
been
able
to
find
a
word
and
i
have
no
doubt
to
never
will
be
exactly
one
word,
reasonable,
feasible,
absolutely
unworkable.
i
think
absolutely
unworkable
is
too
strong,
i
seize
upon
feasible
because
i
thought
it
will
just
considerably
stronger
word
than
reasonable,
but
it
ought
to
be
explained
with
words
which
indicate
that
strong
action
is
required
to
eliminate
past
discrimination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
that
is
clear
provided
in
the
null,
you
subsumed
everything
that
has
happened
in
the
past
in
which
has
its
effect
null.
and
there
is
undoubted,
there
is
obviously
enormous
amounts
of
that
effect
in
mobile
and
a
great
deal
of
it
in
charlotte,
and
to
eliminate
discrimination
now,
you
have
to
take
steps
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
that
past
discrimination.
in
my
view,
it
is
not
enough
to
say,
well,
we’ll
leave
things
just
as
they
are,
but
from
now
on,
we’ll
be
good.
that
seems
to
me
not
to
take
the
steps
which
this
court
has
long
indicated
beginning
in
cooper
and
aaron
and
then
green
and
montgomery
county
must
be
taken
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
which
effects
are
effective
null.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
has
to
be
some
intention
to
race
paid
in
the
process
of
eliminating
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
basis
of
race,
yes
mr.
justice.
but
the
touchstone
is
we
submit
the
disestablishment
of
the
dual
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
if
that
something
which
was
done
wrong
in
the
past
has
a
persistent
and
continuing
effect
which
is
present
on
the
scene
now,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
action
must
be
taken
to
negative
that
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that’s
required
by
--
i
think
that
bridge
has
been
caused
long
past
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
actions
must
be
taken
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
that’s
green,
that’s
montgomery
county,
in
green,
the
statute
on
its
face
is
utterly
nondiscriminatory.
but
actually,
it
doesn’t
work
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
the
court
held
it
invalid.
in
montgomery
county,
the
court
held
that
teachers
must
be
assigned
because
of
race.
we
supported
that.
i
was
consulting
the
case.
the
court
adopted
it,
and
i
hadn’t
suppose
there
was
any
ground
to
question
that
actions
must
be
taken
now
based
on
race
in
order
to
eliminate
effects
of
past
discrimination,
and
we
support
that
position.
it’s
only
a
question
really
of
how
far
that
has
to
go.
this
it
seems
to
us
is
what
the
court
ordered
onto
the
constitution
in
brown.
it’s
what
the
court
spelled
out
in
green
and
montgomery
county
and
it
is
the
standard
which
should
be
applied
here.
there
is
today
as
always
a
tendency
for
legal
thinking
to
be
too
much
dominated
by
clichés.
perhaps
this
is
true
about
racial
balance.
there
is
likewise
i
think
the
possibility
of
great
misunderstanding
in
the
talk
about
neighborhood
schools.
for
what
is
worth
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
find
the
phrase,
neighborhood
schools
in
our
brief.
you
will
find
neighborhood
and
you
will
find
schools,
and
perhaps
this
is
just
a
quibble.
but
that
phrase
is
used
by
some
persons
as
a
subterfuge
for
maintaining
segregation
and
i’ve
seen
that
in
my
own
area
of
our
country.
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
applied
in
bad
faith,
it
can
work
out
that
way.
i
have
no
doubt
for
example
that
if
were
applied
in
mobile
without
any
court
supervision
that
it
would
work
out
that
way.
and
i
am
not
appearing
for
such
a
conception
of
the
neighborhood
school.
as
the
president
said
in
his
statement
of
march
24,
1970,
“while
the
dual
school
system
is
the
most
obvious
example,
the
jury
segregation
has
also
found
in
more
subtle
forms
where
authorities
have
deliberately
drawn
attendant
zones
or
chosen
school
locations
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
creating
and
maintaining
racially
separate
schools,
the
jury
segregation
has
held
to
exist.”
in
such
cases,
the
school
board
has
a
positive
duty
to
remedy
it.
this
is
so
even
though
the
board
ostensibly
operates
a
unitary
system.
and
in
the
same
statement,
the
president
said
in
referring
to
executive
action,
“the
neighborhood
school
will
be
deemed
the
most
appropriate
base
for
such
a
system.”
note
that
he
said
base.
he
did
not
mean
that
it
was
the
sole
method
or
the
sole
requirement.
many
methods
are
available
and
our
evidence
in
the
record
in
these
cases
which
will
serve
to
eliminate
or
minimize
the
consequences
of
past
official
conduct.
thus,
there
can
be
truly
impartial
zones,
there
can
be
pairing
of
schools,
and
this
was
particularly
relevant
in
the
smaller
communities
which
previously
had
dual
systems
with
two
schools.
that
was
true
in
new
kent
county,
you
have
a
black
school
and
you
have
a
white
school.
it’s
easy
to
eliminate
the
dual
schools
system
by
saying
one
school
will
take
grades
one
to
four,
the
other
school
will
take
grades
five
to
eight.
and
there
can
be
closing
of
some
schools
and
expanding
of
others,
and
there
can
be
satellite
pairing
when
the
distances
are
not
too
great
and
when
the
corridor
is
not
a
clear
jury
mandate.
and
of
course,
there
must
be
proper
allocation
of
faculty,
and
there
must
be
elimination
of
discrimination
in
busing
and
in
athletics
and
activities.
all
of
these
things
can
be
done
and
should
be
done
as
far
as
feasible
in
order
to
eliminate
the
consequences
of
past
discrimination.
school
boards
are
making
decisions
all
the
time.
they
will
not
have
done
enough
if
they
simply
established
properly
designated
neighborhood
schools.
they
are
making
decisions
daily,
short
range
and
long
range.
they
ought
to
be
required
when
they
make
decisions
to
make
the
choice,
which
will
tend
to
overcome
segregation.
the
decision
making
process
cannot
be
used
to
perpetuate
segregation.
what
schools
are
you
going
to
expand?
what
programs
are
you
going
to
promote?
all
of
these
things
must
be
properly
handled
and
are
required
in
addition
to
the
basic
concept
of
having
children,
especially
small
children,
go
to
school
within
a
feasible
distance
of
their
own
homes.
now
turning
to
another
matter,
there’s
been
some
reference
in
these
arguments
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
provision
which
congress
included
there
with
respect
to
busing.
that
was
in
section
407
(a)
of
that
act
and
the
section
specifically
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
institute
for
or
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
say
civil
action
for
relief,
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says
provided
that
nothing
herein,
nothing
herein
is
the
key
word
of
that
provision,
shall
empower
any
official
or
court
of
the
united
states
to
require
busing
to
achieve
racial
balance.
well,
this
is
not
a
suit
by
the
attorney
general
under
section
407
(a),
there
is
no
provision
in
that
statute
or
in
any
other
statute
because
somewhat
similar
things
have
been
enacted
as
riders
on
hew
appropriation
act
which
take
away
any
powers
which
the
courts
otherwise
have.
all
that
this
statute
does
is
to
make
it
plain
that
that
statute
does
not
add
to
any
authorities
what
the
court
might
otherwise
have.
or
let
me
put
it
another
way,
it
makes
it
plain
that
congress
is
not
under
that
statute
making
an
enactment
under
section
4
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
requires
or
specifically
authorizes
that
that
kind
of
busing
be
done.
i
think
that
the
statutory
acts
in
both
here
and
in
the
appropriation
acts
is
relevant
simply
because
it
indicates
that
congress
has
not
sought
an
extension
to
require
busing
to
achieve
racial
balance
which
in
my
opinion,
though
it’s
not
here
and
i
haven’t
fully
considered
it
and
it
isn’t
brief.
but
in
my
opinion
is
now
advised,
congress
could
in
exercising
its
powers
under
section
4
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
all
i
think
that
that
statutory
language
means
is
that
congress
has
not
exercised
such
powers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
a
court
can
require
a
busing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
can
require
busing
where
it
is
needed
in
order
to
provide
the
remedy
to
disestablish
the
present
consequences
of
past
discrimination.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
don’t.
that’s
simply
a
question
of
the
court
fashioning
a
remedy
to
meet
the
right
which
had
has
established
in
the
brown
case
and
several
subsequent
decisions.
the
right
not
be
discriminated
against
and
that
includes
not
only
present
enactments
but
the
application
of
present
official
decisions
to
fact
circumstances
which
arose
out
of
past
situations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
massachusetts
did
until
1849.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
find
it
hard
to
answer
that
question
without
knowing
more
about
the
facts,
knowing
how
persistent
the
consequences
had
been,
i
would
think
the
chances
were
very
great
that
it
had
washed
out,
but
i
can
conceive
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
how
far
back
mr.
justice.
i
think
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
effect
of
the
past
discrimination
persist
to
any
substantial
extent
that
that
is
relevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
certainly
in
the
charlotte
case
and
i
believe
it’s
in
the
mobile
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
some
of
those
things
are
somewhat
attenuated
just
as
the
historical
instance
of
justice
stewart
has
given,
and
if
you
had
only
those
and
no
more.
the
court
might
say
well
there’s
a
stream
of
history
and
it
isn’t
(inaudible)
not
much
of
what
it’s
left,
but
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
it
is
something
that
has
to
be
considered
and
evaluated
and
passed
upon.
i
don’t
say
that
the
mere
existence
of
it
alone
is
its
efficient
basis
for
a
present
remedy.
now,
there
are
a
couple
of
other
points
to
which
i
should
like
to
refer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
washington?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
state
of
washington.
oh!
excuse
me.
[laughter]
i
though
you
meant
that
it’s
what
you
come
out
of
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
mr.
justice
if
it
could
be
shown
that
schools
had
been
specifically
located
to
deal
with
these
particular
groups
and
for
that
purpose,
i
think
there
might
be
something
which
would
provide
a
basis
for
a
remedy.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
mr.
justice,
it
would
be
de
jure
because
the
decision
that
placed
the
school
there
was
state
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
right
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
it
was
discriminatory
action
on
account
of
race.
the
effects
of
which
may
still
persist.
now,
i
would
like
in
the
short
time
remaining
to
make
reference
to
two
further
factors
to
which
very
little
has
reference
has
been
paid
here.
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
very
important.
the
first
is
the
problem
of
re-segregation,
a
great
deal
of
effort
has
been
expended
and
trying
to
desegregate
schools
in
many
parts
of
the
country
in
north
and
south
and
it
is
constantly
disrupted
because
of
movements
of
population
and
withdrawal
from
schools
going
into
private
schools
which
i
supposed
the
district
of
columbia
declared
some
most
familiar
examples.
mr.
greenberg
said
yesterday
that
under
his
plan
in
three
years,
everything
would
be
straightened
out.
i
can
guarantee
that
it
won’t
be.
under
his
plan,
there
will
be
in
any
city,
there
will
be
shifts
and
adjustments
and
it
will
have
to
be
followed.
one
of
the
problems,
it
seems
to
me
in
this
area
is
not
to
require
too
much.
if
you
require
too
much,
you
aggravate
the
problems
of
movement
and
withdrawal.
if
you
set
up
a
system
which
provides
a
good
deal
of
elimination
of
past
discrimination
and
provide
some
hope
that
it
might
be
reasonably
stable,
you
may
achieve
a
great
deal
more
in
the
long
run
than
if
you
adopt
the
standard
which
counsel
for
the
petitioners
have
advanced.
and
then,
there
is
another
aspect,
this
is
the
problem
which
is
even
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
they
talked
about
it
and
i’m
not
qualified
to
respond
to
the
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
have
read
about
that
as
a
member
of
the
civil
rights
commission.
i
have
read
about
it
as
a
citizen.
i
see
it,
there
certainly
comes
a
place
when
the
white
fleeing
exonerated
or
becomes
complete.
i’m
not
qualified
to
respond
to
the
question
in
any
sense
as
an
expert
or
even
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
mr.
justice
that
there
is
a
tipping
point.
what
i’m
not
qualified
to
say
is
where
it
is
and
i
suspect
that
it
vary
widely
according
to
the
circumstances
including
the
opportunities
to
get
out
either
through
moving
to
other
parts
of
the
city
or
the
use
of
private
schools.
i
would
like
to
make
reference
to
one
other
thing
which
is
black
separatism,
something
that
we
wouldn’t
began
to
learn
about
in
recent
times
and
which
many
of
us
did
not
foresee.
what’s
its
far
from
clear,
how
far
all
of
the
people
represented
by
the
petitioners
here.
i
want
to
have
what
they
seek
for
them.
maybe
they
ought
to
have
it,
maybe
it
would
be
good
certainly
in
my
view
of
the
public
to
facilitate
they’re
getting
it
whenever
they
want
it,
but
it
isn’t
clear
to
me
that
children
should
be
forced
into
schools
either
the
black
children
should
be
forced
into
schools
that
they
don’t
want
to
go
to.
i
encountered
this
first
in
connection
with
predominantly
black
law
schools
and
we
have
of
course
the
example
of
howard
university
here,
which
i
suppose
everyone
has
the
strongest
feelings
that
it
should
be
supported
in
the
united
negro
college
fund
and
other
such
things.
there
still
remains
a
problem
as
to
how
far
black
people
should
be
forced
into
these
matters.
and
so,
i
conclude
that
the
judgment
below
and
this
case
should
be
affirmed
as
an
experiment.
of
course,
it
will
have
to
be
watched
to
see
how
it
works
including
the
good
faith
of
the
board
and
the
diligence
of
the
district
court,
and
the
effects
of
supervening
events
which
will
always
be
with
us.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
didn’t
quite
say
that.
i
didn’t
say
that
all.
i
just
said
that
in
evaluating
the
standard
or
the
objective
which
is
to
be
reached
that
this
is
one
of
the
factors,
one
of
the
intangible,
immeasurable
factors
like
the
problem
of
re-segregation
that
the
district
court
surely
ought
to
take
into
account,
and
if
so,
it
seems
to
me
this
court
has
to
recognize
it
in
some
ways.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice,
it’s
quite
plain
that
when
the
plan
is
established,
when
it
is
adopted,
there
shouldn’t
be
no
opting
out
except
the
majority,
the
minority
transfer
which
we
have
had
in
which
we
have
provided
for.
what
i’m
talking
about
is
what
kind
of
a
plan
should
be
adopted
and
should
be
approved
and
i
think
that
it
is
relevant
to
take
into
account
in
connection
with
that.
