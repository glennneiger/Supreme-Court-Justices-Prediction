mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
area
under
consideration
is
metropolitan
mobile
which
is
portrayed
on
this
map
behind
me
with
a
school
population
in
excess
of
50,000
students.
this
50,000
is
out
of
a
total
mobile
county
school
population
of
approximately
70,000
students.
the
black-white
ratio
in
metropolitan
mobile
is
almost
exactly
50-50.
in
the
system
as
a
whole,
city
and
rural,
the
black-white
ratio
is
about
60%
white,
40,000
students,
40%
black,
30,000
students.
85%
of
the
black
students
were
about
26,000
in
the
system
reside
in
metropolitan
mobile.
at
all
stages
of
the
litigation,
the
courts
and
the
parties
including
the
school
board
have
treated
metropolitan
mobile
as
a
separate
matter.
the
proceedings
which
have
resulted
in
this
writ
of
certiorari
focus
on
integration
of
the
elementary
schools
in
metropolitan
mobile
although
facts
just
furnished
to
us
by
respondents
and
set
forth
in
a
supplemental
brief
filed
saturday
indicates
the
junior
high
schools
and
the
high
schools
there
in
which
a
substantial
degree
of
integration
was
supposed
to
have
been
accomplished
are
in
very
substantial
measure
identifiably
black.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
in
this
school
system,
where
the
entire
spectrum
of
school
assignment
techniques
have
been
used
in
the
past
to
maintain
racial
segregation,
noncontiguous
zoning,
satellite
zoning,
pairing,
busing,
a
bewildering
array
of
deviations
in
grade,
structure,
portable
classrooms,
school
closings,
school
construction.
whether
those
techniques,
which
have
been
employed
in
the
service
of
segregation
now
ought
to
be
used
in
the
service
of
integration
or
is
the
sole
standard
to
be
an
innovation.
that
is
the
exclusive
employment
of
the
neighborhood
school,
whatever
that
means,
now
suggested
by
the
united
state’s
and
the
respondents
as
a
method
of
school
assignment
even
though
it
results
in
an
exceedingly
high
degree
of
racial
concentration.
some
children
have,
in
the
past
in
mobile
sometimes
been
assigned
on
the
basis
of
some
concept
of
neighborhood
among
a
number
of
other
assignment
factors,
but
as
the
sole
means
of
assignment,
it
is
an
innovation.
it
might
be
added
at
this
point,
at
least
i
would
like
to
add
at
this
point
parenthetically
an
answer
to
the
argument
which
emerges
from
this
sharp
departure
in
administration
which
was
anticipated
yesterday
by
counsel
for
the
charlotte
school
board
who
stated
and
by
mr.
blake
who
stated
today
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right.
that
seems
to
be
the
only
answer
to
this
series
of
facts
which
exists
here
in
mobile
and
in
the
other
case,
the
other
case
argued
earlier.
he
conceded
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right
was
the
only
answer
and
however
satisfying
that
aphorism
might
be,
a
brief
analysis
of
it,
we
submit,
illuminates
the
issues
in
this
case.
busing
to
segregate
was
indeed
wrong
so
was
noncontiguous
zoning,
portable
classrooms
and
so
forth
but
the
wrong
was
not
the
busing
or
the
zoning,
it
was
the
racial
segregation.
these
assignment
techniques
were
normal,
neutral,
administrative
means
of
implementing
a
governmental
policy,
in
this
case
an
unconstitutional
governmental
policy.
similarly,
transportation
and
the
various
other
aids
of
school
assignment
in
the
service
of
integration
are
neither
good
nor
bad,
it
considered
abstract.
they
are
similarly
instruments
in
the
service
of
disestablishing
an
unconstitutional
system.
the
question
under
review
is
this
court’s
judgment
of
june
--
is
the
fifth
circuit’s
judgment
of
june
8,
1970
as
modified
by
judgments
of
august
4
and
august
28,
1970.
these
were
the
ninth,
tenth
and
eleventh
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit
since
1963.
the
case
is
now
pending
there
on
further
appeal,
having
to
do
with
enforcement
of
the
transportation
and
faculty
portions
of
the
earlier
decree.
it
has
been
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
a
sufficient
number
of
times
so
that
the
docket
entries
alone
occupy
half
of
the
first
volume
of
this
record
and
throughout
these
proceedings,
a
vast
quantity
of
materials
have
accumulated.
nevertheless,
the
salient
facts
are
clear
and
they
are
not
complex
and
the
issues
confronting
the
court
are
clear.
the
essence
of
the
problem
is
revealed
in
statistics
filed
by
the
respondent
in
the
district
court
on
october
2nd,
a
week
ago,
last
friday
and
not
i
may
add
served
on
us.
respondent’s
document
has
been
reproduced
in
our
supplemental
brief,
filed
with
the
court
on
october
10th
and
analyzing
the
brief.
it
is
a
photocopy
of
their
document
in
our
own
brief.
and
what
i
am
about
to
describe
is
the
board’s
own
statistics
although
we
submit
that
upon
an
evidentiary
hearing
we
could
demonstrate
to
the
facts
are
far
worse.
the
fifth
circuit
plan
in
operation
according
to
their
statistics,
results
in
7,651
or
about
two
thirds
of
all
the
negro
school
children
of
metropolitan
mobile
attending
all
black
elementary
schools
using
the
fifth
circuit’s
definition
of
an
all
black
school
as
one
with
fewer
than
10%
white
students.
this
map
of
metropolitan
mobile
indicates
the
elementary
school
districts
in
that
portion
of
the
system.
it
is
approximately
10
miles
across
the
west
and
18
miles
from
north
to
south.
almost
all
black
children
are
separated
from
the
preponderant
white
portion
of
the
city
by
interstate
65.
this
is
the
separating
line,
this
is
the
black
section,
this
is
the
white
section.
the
all
black
zones
now
on
their
own
admissions
include
robins
which
is
all
black,
grant
which
is
all
black,
brazier
which
is
all
black,
palm
(ph)
which
is
all
black,
stanton
road
which
is
all
black,
fonde
which
is
all
black,
owens
which
is
all
black,
collier
(ph)
which
is
all
black,
council
which
is
all
black.
then
here
is
whitley
which
is
89%
blend,
all
black,
1%
from
the
fifth
circuit
definition
and
other
schools
ranging
from
64,
76
and
80%
black.
now,
these
districts
here,
using
again
a
definition
of
no
more
than
10%
black
students
are
all
white.
indian
springs
all
white,
forest
hill
all
white,
austin
all
white,
fonde
all
white,
shepherd
all
white,
morningside
all
white,
merck
is
all
white,
westmont
all
white,
williams
all
white.
here
is
a
district
with
52%
white
drawn
from
an
all
black
enclave
here,
but
for
many
years
there
was
the
only
one
to
12
school
in
the
system,
the
school
being
one
to
12
so
that
it
would
absorb
all
the
black
children
in
that
area.
the
school
is
closed
and
now
they
go
to
school
over
there.
there
are
in
fact
some
small
percentage
of
white
students
living
in
some
of
the
90%
to
more
black
districts,
but
under
the
plan,
as
it
is
operated,
as
the
respondents
have
informed
the
district
court
for
reasons
that
we
do
not
know,
not
all
of
them
and
perhaps
none
of
them
are
attending
the
schools
to
which
they
are
assigned.
there
is
a
motion
pending
in
the
district
court
about
that
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
a
hearing.
moreover,
the
petition
which
we
took
to
this
court
involves
only
elementary
schools.
the
high
school
situation,
however,
under
actual
enrollment
figures
now
furnished
seems
far
worse
than
projected
in
the
government’s
plan
which
is
essentially
adopted
below.
as
page
three
of
our
supplemental
brief
indicates,
more
than
6700
negro
students
will
be
going
to
high
school
and
junior
high
school
in
all
black
schools.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
preponderant
number
of
black
students
in
metropolitan
mobile
will
be
spending
half
of
their
education,
the
elementary
years
in
all
black
schools
and
the
so
called
palliative
of
integrated
junior
high
and
high
school
education
which
does
not,
in
any
event
cure
denial
of
constitutional
rights
for
the
first
six
years,
will
in
fact
not
exist
for
them.
and
the
issue
is,
does
this
final,
this
is
a
final
desegregation
plan,
does
it
satisfy
the
fourteenth
amendment?
the
fourteenth
amendment
rule
as
most
recently
been
expounded
in
green
and
alexander
as
requiring
the
ending
of
the
last
vestiges
of
segregation
and
the
elimination
of
segregation,
root
and
branch.
and
we
submit
that
that
imperative
is
far,
exceedingly
far
from
having
been
satisfied.
now
the
justification
offered
by
respondent
and
the
united
states
for
leaving
racial
segregation
essentially
intact
in
metropolitan
mobile
is
that
the
result
is
required
by
neighborhood
schools.
in
assessing
the
so-called
neighborhood
school
zoning
of
mobile,
we
might
however
first
describe
the
methods
of
school
zoning
which
mobile
has
used
traditionally.
on
this
record,
the
school
district
buses
more
than
20,000
students
at
an
average
round
trip
of
30
miles
a
day.
most
of
the
busing
is
in
the
rural
area,
but
there
is
a
substantial
amount
at
shorter
distances
in
the
city
and
so
busing
is
hardly
foreign
to
mobile
education
and
this
figure
compares
fairly
well
with
the
fact
that
40%
of
all
american
school
children
are
bused
to
school.
some
of
this
busing
has
clearly
been
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
racial
segregation.
as
for
example,
when
approximately
600
black
students
were
bused
from
rural
saraland
down
to
around
this
area
to
an
all
black
school.
approximately
7000
students
in
the
western
part
of
mobile
over
here,
it’s
in
the
metropolitan
area,
are
bused
where
the
school
districts
are
large
and
the
distances
are
somewhat
greater
and
the
preponderant
part
of
the
white
population
lives.
but
the
point
is
that
busing
is
common
place
in
mobile
education.
mobile
has
in
the
past
regularly
used
noncontiguous
zoning.
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
pages
7
(a)
that’s
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
look
at
the
two
pages
of
colored
maps
there.
these
maps
were
prepared
by
the
united
states
and
have
been
adopted
from
their
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
zones
on
the
map
are
colored
in
a
way
so
that
all
parts
of
a
noncontiguous
zone
are
the
same
color
and
some
of
these
involve
so
called
satellite
zoning
and
some
of
it
involves
noncontiguous
pairing.
it
can
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
mobile
has
assigned
children
to
schools
on
anything
but
a
neighborhood
basis.
the
difference
is
of
course
this
map
depicts
a
period
in
which
noncontiguous
zoning
was
used
to
maintain
racial
segregation.
on
the
first
page,
for
example,
the
bright
pink
portions
constitute
a
single
school
zone
in
which
black
children
were
bused
in
the
northern
part
of
the
zone
to
the
pink
semi-circular
sections
in
the
right
side
which
is
the
saraland
situation
i
was
describing
a
moment
ago.
white
children
attended
a
single
school
from
the
blue
portion
of
the
map,
that
being
satellite
zoning.
there
was
a
school
in
one
part,
but
not
in
the
other.
but
the
corridor
between
the
two
sections
called
thomas
was
formed
because
blacks
lived
in
there
and
they
were
not
to
go
to
the
white
school.
on
the
next
page,
the
bright
red
portions
of
the
map,
again
just
taking
an
example,
constitute
a
white
school
zone
and
white
children
at
brookley
went
up
to
the
white
school
at
woodcock.
mr.
jack
greenberg
now?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
your
honor
you’re
going
to
have
difficulty
as
i
have
had
in
going
from
one
map
to
another
because
mobile
has
changed
its
school
assignment
system
so
frequently
and
so
much
from
year
to
year
that
zones
you
will
see
on
one
map,
mr.
justice,
one
year
will
not
be
on
the
map
for
the
subsequent
year
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
went
to
a
black
school
named
thomas
in
the
thomas
zone
at
that
time.
there
was
a
black
school
named
thomas
in
the
thomas
zone
between
whistler
and
parks
and
black
students
went
to
the
thomas
school
and
white
students
attended
school,
a
single
school
from
whistler
and
parks.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
the
outline
of
the
thomas
school
between
whistler
and
parks
is
all
in
white,
it’s
not
colored
in.
we’ve
colored
only
the
noncontiguous
zones.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
are
maps
that
i
believe
is
i
think
zoning
in
1964
and
1965.
it’s
a
composite
prepared
by
the
department
of
justice
for
those
two
years.
the
noncontiguous
zoning,
the
noncontiguous
zones
are
listed
on
page
19
(a)
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart,
for
each
of
the
years.
if
you
will
turn
there,
there
is
a
list
with
a
single
spaced
page
of
rather
small
type
which
lists
all
the
noncontiguous
zones
which
existed
in
the
mobile
school
system
and
by
year,
the
’63,
’64,
’65,
’65,
’66,
’67
that's
as
of
the
time
when
that
record
was
made.
now,
if
this
analysis
of
the
last
five
minutes
is
not
completely
laid
to
rest
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
notion
of
neighborhood
schools
in
mobile,
i
would
like
to
add
that
in
the
black
areas,
whenever
they
had
a
school
where
the
capacity
of
the
school
is
filled
up
by
black
children,
they
wanted
to
put
more
blacks
in,
they
added
portable
classrooms
and
the
records
show
that
with
respect
to
white
children,
they
did
the
same
thing.
the
capacity
of
a
school
can
determine
the
neighborhood
it
will
serve,
but
where
the
capacity
of
a
school
is
a
readily
expandable
thing
like
an
accordion,
almost
it’s
like
an
alice
in
wonderland,
what
is
the
capacity
of
the
school?
the
capacity
of
the
school
is
whatever
the
decision
of
the
school
board
decides
that
it
should
be.
in
fact
in
mobile,
portable
classrooms,
the
record
shows,
were
substantially
added
to
black
schools
while
white
schools
were
under
capacity
and
this
is
shown
by
respondent’s
report
which
is
on
page
208
of
the
appendix
and
in
appendix
d
to
our
brief.
appendix
d
to
our
brief
has
a
list
of
portable
classrooms
and
so
the
notion
of
neighborhood
has
somehow
related
to
a
fixed
capacity
of
school
while
we
would
submit
in
no
cases
applicable
here
is
ludicrous.
another
way
school
population
is
defined
is
by
grade
structure.
in
this
all
black
area
over
here,
which
is
called
hillsdale,
they
had
the
only
one
to
12
school
in
the
city
of
mobile
and
i
mentioned
that
earlier
because
that
absorbs
all
the
black
kids.
this,
for
example,
only
a
k-3
school
or
a
high
school
or
junior
high
school,
the
black
kids
will
then
have
to
go
to
schools
elsewhere.
that
school
ultimately
was
closed,
but
it’s
a
normal
and
quite
recent
assignment
practice
of
the
school
system.
elsewhere
in
this
system,
there
is
the
most
variegated
combination
of
great
structures.
an
expert
witness
said
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it.
in
our
brief
on
page
35,
there
is
just
a
summary
of
the
great
structures
which
they
have
used
in
15,
16,
17,
18
19,
25,
67,
68,
69,
610,
612,
7,
78,
79,
711,
712,
812
and
i
am
just
picking
them
out.
in
other
words,
the
notion
of
neighborhood
as
determined
by
the
capacity
of
a
school
serving
a
geographical
area
is
even
--
well,
it
is
a
concept
that
is
really
not
capable
of
definition,
certainly
in
this
case.
we
saw
in
the
swann
case,
the
charlotte
case
that
what
is
claimed
to
be
a
neighborhood
that
is
a
contiguous
zone
can
consist
of
something
like
the
shape
of
a
dumbbell,
two
large
round
areas
are
connected
by
a
connecting
bar.
the
connecting
bars
in
there,
it's
called
a
neighborhood
and
if
you
take
that
out,
it's
called
noncontiguous
zoning
and
not
a
neighborhood
school.
but
the
complexities
and
curiosities
of
the
neighborhood
school
system
in
mobile
are
even
more
fantastic
than
that.
the
record
will
show
that
mobile
school
officials
define
the
neighborhood
school
not
merely
in
geographical
terms
but
in
psychological
and
sociological
terms
as
well,
whatever
that
may
mean.
the
question
for
this
court
therefore
is
whether
in
a
school
system,
which
has
been
segregated
by
law
until
1954
and
which
remained
completely
segregated
until
1969
and
which
is
still
now
overwhelmingly
segregated
as
the
result
of
a
so-called
final
desegregation
plan
under
which
it
now
operates,
this
court,
supervising
district
courts
sitting
in
equity
should
fashion
an
effective
remedy
to
forever
end
the
unconstitutional
administration
of
the
school
system
so
far
as
race
is
concerned.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
an
effective
remedy
would
end
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
submit
it’s
not
the
job
of
the
district
court
to
keep
up
with
it,
on
its
own
initiative.
it’s
like
any
other
decree
in
equity
if
a
party
or
parties
come
to
the
court
with
a
pleading
setting
forth
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
and
the
court
will
examine
it
and
decide
whether
relief
should
be
granted.
but
the
court
is
not
going
to
replace
the
school,
but
ultimately
the
school
board
has
a
constitutional
duty,
having
taken
the
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution,
to
keep
up
with
this
kind
of
thing
and
the
district
court
may
or
may
not
be
called
upon
to
do
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
several
observations
in
an
effort
to
answer
that.
and
one
is,
in
a
city
like
mobile,
indeed
many
communities
which
may
come
before
a
court
or
this
court,
will
have
a
situation
in
which
the
constitution
has
been
violated
without
a
doubt
to
their
knowledge
from
1954
to
1969
and
it
may
be
not
asking
too
much
to
take
another
look
at
it
again
three
years
later.
it’s
not
as
if
they
have
been
thoroughly
well
integrated
for
a
hundred
years
and
then
someone
is
suddenly
calling
them
into
court.
secondly,
it
maybe
that
the
court
will
have
to
look
at
it
as
indeed
in
policing
an
antitrust
decree
or
a
water
rights
case
or
anything.
so
it
is
possible
and
then
a
judgment
will
have
to
be
made
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
as
your
question
implies,
will
a
period
arrive
sometime
in
history
in
which
the
court
will
no
longer
ever
have
to
look
at
it
again,
i
imagine
that
at
some
point
it
would
arrive,
but
now
one
year
after
mobile
has
first
taken
a
step
going
only
as
far
as
it
has,
i
suggest,
it's
premature
to
consider
that
question.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
again,
that’s
not
this
case,
but
i
don’t
want
to
evade
your
question
by
giving
that
kind
of
an
answer
to
it.
the
school
board
is
being
asked
to
take
affirmative
action
at
this
time
to
undo
a
long
history
of
quite
vigorously
enforced
discrimination
and
i
think
it
--
we’re
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case,
i
would
assume
that
in
a
period
of
three
years,
the
racial
segregation
which
has
been
so
virulent
and
has,
as
mr.
napier
(ph)
said
earlier,
in
a
part
of
american
history
there
is
slavery
for
a
hundred
years
and
segregation
for
a
hundred
more,
it
may
not
be
so
easily
uprooted.
it
maybe
the
court
will
have
to
look
at
it
again
and
see
whether
or
not
this
is
just
a
natural
movement
of
upward
mobility
to
get
a
house
with
an
additional
bedroom
or
is
related
to
something
else.
but
that's
on
a
record
that
i
haven’t
seen
and
no
one
has
seen.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
racial
balance
is
in
your
question,
not
in
my
statement
and
it’s
not
a
term.
i
think,
it
was
made
quite
clear
that
we
are
advancing
to
this
court.
the
solicitor
reads
our
brief
which
says,
we
disallow
racial
balance,
it
says
aha,
that
shows
they
are
for
racial
balance.
so
i
would
like
to
say
that
if
you’re
hypothesizing
a
case
of
racial
balance,
i’ll
answer
it
in
terms
of
the
hypothesis,
but
it
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
it’s
not
a
question
of
balance,
it's
all
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
any
figure
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
figure
which
i
mentioned
was
merely
describing
the
racial
population
just
so
the
court
would
have
an
understanding
of
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are.
i
was
not
proposing
any
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
did.
i
did
use
the
fifth
circuit
definition
as
describing
those
districts
and
the
school
that
i
call
all
black,
is
in
terms
of
fifth
circuit
definition
has
indicated
here,
90%
black.
yes,
that's
correct.
i
would,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
time
when
the
courts
can
divest
themselves
with
this
problem.
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
would
be
three
years
from
now.
but
it
would
be
at
some
time
and
we
don’t
know
when.
i
think,
only
experience
will
tell.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
they
are
wholly
private
decision
making
and
can
be
totally
divested
from
everything
else,
i
might
tend
to
agree
it
would
be
sooner
rather
than
later.
but,
i
think,
a
careful
examinations
of
records
indicate
frequently
that
what
is
taken
to
be
wholly
private
is
often
not
wholly
private.
i
think,
we
have
to
see.
but
on
the
hypothesis
that
it's
wholly
private
and
on
hypothesis
that
we
have
had
a
completely
desegregated
system
and
so
forth,
i
would
say
such
a
time
could
arrive.
i
was
beginning
to
say
that
the
question
for
this
court
as
we
see
it
on
this
record
is
whether
in
a
school
system
which
has
been
segregated
by
law
until
1954
and
which
remained
segregated
until
1969
and
which
is
now
still
overwhelmingly
segregated
as
the
result
of
a
so
called
final
desegregation
plan,
this
court,
supervising
district
court
sitting
in
equity
should
fashion
an
effective
remedy
to
forever
end
the
unconstitutional
administration
of
the
school
system,
so
far
as
race
is
concerned.
we
submit
that
this
court,
as
a
remedial
measure,
should
declare
a
rule
which
requires
that
every
black
child
at
every
grade
in
his
educational
career
must
be
free
of
assignment
to
a
racially
identifiable
minority
school
and
such
a
school,
in
language
of
our
brief
is
one
which
by
reason
of
a
very
considerable
concentration
or
disproportion
is
conceive
and
designed
to
receive
black
children.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
is
the
former
but
the
two
are
intertwined
because
you
do
not
get
to
disestablish
a
segregated
school
system
except
for
the
fourteenth
amendment,
unless
there
are
state
or
federal
legislation,
but
it
is
essentially
the
fourteenth
amendment
we
are
talking
about
in
cases
like
this.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
remedial
measure.
we
are
talking
about
a
remedy
but
frequently
from
remedies,
rights
do
stem,
in
an
antitrust
case,
you
may
get
a
right
to
license
or
a
right
to
the
government,
again
a
right
to
compel
divestiture,
which
is
a
remedy,
you
could
not
do
but
for
the
fact
of
a
certain
substance
of
violation.
however
it
is
a
remedy.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
you
are
limiting
your
question
to
areas
where
there
has
been
segregation
imposed
by
law
in
some
form?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
my
answer
is
no
and
i
have
to
explain
the
reason
for
the
answer,
so
i
would
be
sure
that
i
am
not
misunderstood.
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
essentially
raising
what
might
be
called
the
de
facto
question,
whether
where
there
has
been
no
de
jure
segregation
and
there
is
nevertheless
a
considerable
concentration
of
black
students
in
a
racially
identifiable
school,
nevertheless,
one
may
obtain
a
decree
from
a
federal
district
court
integrating
the
schools
according
to
the
measures
we
propose.
my
answer
to
that
is
we
require
some
finding
of
--
we
think
that
this,
the
rulings
of
this
court
require,
that
there
have
been
some
segregation
imposed
by
law.
we
think,
however
that
in
parts
of
the
country
which
are
normally
not
referred
to
south
are
out
of
south,
one
can
find
that
segregation
imposed
by
law
as
in
denver
and
in
new
rochelle
and
in
other
places
where
it
has
been
found
and
it
has
been
done
by
court
and
we
think
that
a
searching
record
in
other
places
would
turn
it
up
as
well.
we
will
assume
that
there
are
places
where
that
has
not
been
established
and
cannot
be
established.
and
in
those
places,
i
personally
would
be
willing
to
urge
a
court
that
the
same
remedy
should
apply.
it
would
be
on
a
different
basis,
not
this
case
and
i
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
concede
that's
an
open
question
and
hardly
the
thing
to
be
decided
here
today.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
correct.
in
that
case
one
would
have
to
find
a
substantive
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
is
a
case
we're
arguing
on
the
basis
of
remedy
and
i
would
readily
admit,
as
i
would
have
to,
a
fair
reading
of
the
cases
indicate
that
other
cases
an
open
question.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
mr.
justice
black
because
i
did
not
get
to
state
the
second
part
of
my
rule,
is
that
it
must
be
feasible
or
workable
and
as
you
described
the
case
without
really
understanding
the
situation
any
further,
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
that
would
be
feasible
or
workable.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i
mean
feasible
or
workable
to
integrate
the
school
is
what
i
am
referring
to.
one
would
have
to
find
some
workable
method
of
integrating
the
schools
there
and
at
least
the
case
is
put
to
me,
i
cannot
think
of
a
way
of
doing
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
well
that
is
the
second
part
of
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
would
i
give
the
same
answer
from
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
imagine
i
would
have
to,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
will
confess
that
i
like
perhaps
some
others
in
the
court
that
are
confused
about
the
feasible,
the
workable,
the
reasonable
test
and
i
think
we
have
to
focus
not
on
those
words
which
have
been
used
in
ways
that
make
them
so
inherently
confusing,
but
on
something
else
that
relates
to
them
and
that
is
first
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
green
use
feasible.
mr.
jack
greenberg
workable
was
used
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
carter
case,
the
feasible
using
green,
reasonable
is
in
the
fourth
circuit.
i
think
we
would
have
focus
on
something
else
as
these
words
that
are
being
used
are
getting
us
nowhere
and
i
think
we
want
to
focus
on
one,
the
result
to
be
achieved
and
the
result
is
the
elimination
of
the
all-black
school
and
workability
or
whatever
other
word
you
used
have
to
be
seen
in
that
context
and
then
the
casting
of
the
burden.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
so
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
also
seen
and
i
think
we
used
it
in
that
sense
also
in
terms
of
the
burden.
if
it
appears
it
can
be
done
as
a
very
heavy
burden
on
the
board
to
establish
that
it
cannot
be
done.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
possible
and
in
mobile
--
and
in
mobile
and
charlotte
and
in
athens
in
different
ways.
we
know
it’s
possible
in
athens
because
they
are
doing
it,
we
know
it’s
possible
in
charlotte,
it
happened
today.
we
know
it’s
possible
in
mobile
because
they
have
done
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
have
done
far
more
than
they
really
have
to
do.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
a
considerably
heavy
burden.
now
that
the
solicitor
had
said
that
we
are
arguing
some
theory
of
racial
balance,
he
has
read
the
clear
language
of
our
brief,
he
picked
it
up
and
he
read
it.
i
had
to
turn
to
it
because
i
thought
maybe
this
brief
had
been
changed
down
at
the
printer
or
something
when
he
said
well
see
therefore
racial
balance
and
i
was
really
scared
when
he
started
reading
that
because
i
thought
it
said
something
it
did
not
say,
but
it
says
what
it
was
supposed
to
say
that
in
the
unitary
school
system,
no
black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
black
school
and
i
think
we
can
explain
it
at
considerable
length
that
that
does
not
mean
racial
balance
and
why.
as
we
understand
the
meaning
of
racial
balance,
it
means
that
every
school
has
to
reflect
approximately
the
percentage
of
students
in
the
same
ratio
as
their
ratio
in
the
overall
population.
in
metropolitan
mobile,
it
would
be
50-50.
in
charlotte
it
would
be
70-129
and
mr.
chambers
made
it
clear
yesterday
and
i
am
making
it
clear
now
that
that
is
not
what
we
are
arguing.
our
position
is
that
the
constitutional
obligation,
just
establish
a
dual
segregated
system
requires
at
least
that
the
resultant
schools
are
ones
which
are
not
so
overwhelmingly
black
when
considered
with
a
total
population
of
that
school
district,
that
it’s
considered
to
be
a
black
school.
and
we
differ
also
from
the
government
which
use
the
words
feasible
and
workable
as
we
have
in
that
we
focus
on
result.
we
say
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
suggest
that
a
most
heavy
burden
is
on
the
school
board
to
establish
that
a
means
to
end
segregation,
that
means
to
end
segregation
do
not
exist
and
the
plan
does
not
work.
in
mobile
it
is
workable
because
i
think
of
the
ten
techniques
they
have
used
if
they
picked
any
two
or
three
they
could
do
it
and
certainly
if
they
used
all
the
ten.
athens,
it’s
workable,
charlotte
it’s
workable.
mr.
justice
black’s
hypothesis,
i
would
assume
it’s
not
workable.
(inaudible)
so
it
is
not
workable,
but
we
have
this
case
here
and
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
--
that
it’s
difficult
enough
without
considering
all
the
cases
that
we
don’t
have
here.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
actually
that
interstate
is
the
boundary
between
a
number
of
school
districts.
it
is
the
boundary,
well
in
fact
that
school,
it
is
the
--
or
having
thought
of
it
that
way
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
it
is
a
common
school
boundary
for
a
large
number
of
school
districts.
well
they
have
moved
school
districts
around
all
over
the
place
and
i
think
they
would
just
--
one
way
of
doing
it,
not
that
they
have
to
reach
the
interstate
barrier,
they
might
do
a
variety
of
above.
actually,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
has
adopted
a
plan
called
alternative
b1
and
i
wanted
to
make
--
have
it
clearly
understood
that
we
are
not
urging
alternative
b1
upon
the
court.
alternative
b1
was
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
government
to
be
a
feasible
plan.
it
was
designed
by
hew.
it
was
one
of
four
plans
that
could
work
to
desegregate
mobile.
we
are
not
urging
it
upon
the
court
because
they
have
not
--
this
record
is
riddled
with
denials
of
hearings,
ex
parte
action,
the
facts
have
changed
and
it
is
entirely
possible
that
at
this
moment
it
would
not
be
an
appropriate
scheme
for
mobile,
but
it
is
approximately
the
sort
of
thing
which
can
do
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
thank
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
indeed
been
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
mobile
and
that
confusion
has
stemmed
in
considerable
part
from
the
fact
that
judge
thomas
has
not
given
hearings
in
any
of
these
plans
for
a
period
of
two
years
and
as
an
example,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
question
of
the
missing
students.
one
reason
why
there
are
some
missing
students
is
there
has
been
a
loss
of
population
of
approximately
17,000
over
the
past
few
years
in
mobile
because
of
the
closing
of
the
brookley
air
force
base
but
another
reason
is
that
there
is
something
down
there
known
as
non-conformers,
children
going
to
school
as
they
please,
where
they
please
in
violation
of
the
court
order.
mr.
cooper
and
i
went
in
to
see
judge
thomas
about
two
weeks
ago
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
non-conformers
and
he
said
he
would
set
it
for
some
time
in
november.
we
pointed
out
that
we
thought
there
was
some
urgency
to
setting
it
and
setting
it
soon
because
school
was
going
on
now
and
he
said
he
would
set
it
in
november
and
if
we
disagreed,
we
could
go
to
the
fifth
circuit.
that
is
why
we
have
had
confusion
in
mobile
and
why
it’s
very
difficult
to
understand
what’s
going
on.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
there
have
been
wholesale
transfers
of
students,
again
in
violation
of
the
order
and
only
last
week,
the
justice
department
was
able
to
get
a
hearing
before
judge
thomas
and
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
that
but
it
may
be
part
of
the
wholesale
transfers,
it
may
be
non-conformers.
so
far
as
the
[voice
overlap]
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
are
voluntary
transfers
granted
in
violation
of
where
the
assignments
ought
to
be
under
the
order.
now
alternative
b
one,
contrary
to
what
mr.
philips
and
mr.
stockman
say
is
not
a
plan
we’re
urging
upon
this
court.
because
we
cannot
urge
it
with
any
confidence,
there
has
never
been
a
hearing
on
that.
however,
it
is
a
general
notion
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
done
if
one
wants
to
assign
students
according
to
normal
systems
or
school
administration
of
mobile
and
end
up
with
an
integrated
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don’t
know.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don’t
know
mr.
chief
justice.
we’ve
been
unable
to
get
a
hearing.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
answer
is
i
just
don’t
know.
the
thing
that
we
have
focused
on
mostly
is
first
of
all
wholesale
transfers,
we
don’t
know
to
what
extent
they’re
voluntary.
if
they
are
involuntary,
we
don’t
know
whether
or
not
they
have
been
coerced
or
suggested
in
any
way.
we
do
know
there
are
large
numbers
of
so
called
non-conformers,
children
going
to
school
without
official
assignment,
just
attending
schools
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
a
hearing
and
there
is
indeed
confusion
down
there
but
i
can
describe
a
good
part
of
it
to
what
i’ve
just
said.
may
it
please
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
have
been
hearings
at
various
times.
the
plan
that’s
in
effect
was
put
in
following
a
pre-trial
conference
but
a
trial
was
never
held.
we
just
put
right
in
by
judge
thomas
without
a
hearing.
at
an
earlier
stage,
we
made
a
motion
to
the
court
that
this
thing
hadn’t
occurred
several
times,
saying
that
we
would
like
a
procedure
set
down
for
filing
objections
and
papers
and
having
a
hearing
and
it
was
denied
and
that’s
all
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
it’s
in
the
record.
may
it
please
the
court,
despite
the
considerable
disagreement
over
the
matters
discussed
in
the
last
moment
or
two;
there
has
been
nevertheless
a
remarkable
amount
of
agreement
among
the
parties
and
the
courts
below.
with
the
exception
of
the
more
plaintiffs
who
feel
that
nothing
at
all
ought
to
be
done
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
who
have
not
addressed
themselves
to
the
question
of
what
ought
to
be
done,
everyone
or
perhaps
everyone
appears
to
agree
that
race
can
and
must
be
taken
into
account
to
undo
the
effects
of
the
jury
segregated
school
system.
the
fifth
circuit
has
moved
lines
and
it
has
gerrymandered,
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
that
and
indeed
in
the
swann
case
itself
has
approved
busing
and
noncontiguous
zoning
for
junior
high
school
and
high
school
students.
the
solicitor
general
advocates
gerrymandering
when
it
feels
it’s
appropriate,
building
schools,
closing
schools.
charlotte
school
board
believes
it
can
gerrymander
in
the
face
of
the
advice
of
its
counsel
but
its
counsel
thinks
it
can
locate
schools
but
not
move
school
zone
lines.
the
athens
board
believes
it
can
do
what
it
calls
pocket
busing
which
is
what
we
call
noncontiguous
zoning
or
clustering.
judge
mcmillan
believes
that
relief
should
be
effective
and
he
should
use
a
variety
of
techniques
to
achieve
a
result
of
no
identifiable
negro
school.
we
urge
in
the
mobile
case
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed,
that
the
case
be
sent
back
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
alexander
against
holmes
county
for
hearings
and
a
timetable
i
suggest
to
pay
alexander
but
a
plan,
not
alternate
of
b1
devised
by
hew
but
a
plan
of
that
general
nature,
using
the
techniques
that
have
been
available
in
mobile
be
employed
and
that
the
test
be
one
of
results
not
anything
else.
now,
i
would
say
in
further
response
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
of
yesterday
which
was
essentially
when
can
the
federal
courts
get
out
of
this
business.
that
is
the
federal
courts
will
get
out
of
this
business
as
soon
as
the
results
are
achieved
with
an
identifiable
clear
test
is
decided
upon
and
people
know
what
they
have
to
do
where
in
mobile,
as
an
extreme
example,
they
haven’t
had
the
slightest
(inaudible).
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don’t
believe
he
did
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
would
not
urge
that,
we
do
not
urge
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
certainly
in
many
cases
that
would
be
satisfied.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
then
have
to
look
at
the
workability
test
in
one
aspect
of
that
at
the
general
distribution
of
population
the
community
and
another
aspect.
i
think
judge
mcmillan
handled
it
quite
pragmatically,
he
had
a
4%
school
and
he
had
a
40%
school.
he
did
not
insist
upon
a
rigid
ratio,
we
don’t
but
just
as
in
the
jury
cases
which
have
been
spoken
about
which
i
think
are
really
not
appropriate
in
many
respects,
the
universe
is
larger,
you’re
not
dealing
with
12
people,
you’re
dealing
with
900
people.
you
do
look
at
the
numbers
to
get
some
idea
of
whether
or
not
there’s
been
to
wide
a
deviation.
it’s
impossible
to
come
to
a
judgment
without
looking
at
the
numbers
and
a
90-10
district
would
be
one
thing
and
a
50-50
district
would
have
to
be
another,
you
can’t
avoid
them.
mr.
jack
greenberg
you’re
entirely
right
mr.
chief
justice
and
judge
johnson
in
the
carr
against
montgomery
county
school
board
of
education
case
in
which
he
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
in
turn
reversed
by
this
court
and
judge
johnson’s
orders
reinstated.
he
set
up
a
ratio
and
i
think
it
was
a
60-40
ratio
if
i
recall
correctly
and
allowed
a
15%
deviation
because
he
needed
something
he
could
administer.
when
he
was
talking
to
the
school
district
there
in
terms
of
generalities
and
not
in
terms
of
results,
it
just
didn’t
work.
when
he
had
something
he
could
administer,
he
then
had
something
that
was
clear
they
had
an
order
they
knew
they
could
follow
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
has
worked
very
well.
not
only
there
but
in
hundreds
of
districts
around
the
country.
may
it
please
the
court
16
years
have
passed
since
the
first
brown
decision
was
handed
down
by
this
court
and
in
mobile
as
in
hundreds
of
cities
and
towns
across
the
south,
black
children
born
in
the
year
of
that
decision
have
completed
their
entire
public
school
careers
without
ever
attending
a
segregated
school.
in
the
record
by
district
resistance
of
the
constitution
is
well
known
to
this
court
and
i
will
not
repeat
it
here.
but
i
do
urge
upon
this
court
that
now,
in
1970,
last
begins
to
appear
than
more
than
a
decade
and
a
half
of
litigation
is
bearing
fruit
in
desegregation
decreased
whether
litigated
or
consented
to.
it
is
essential
to
the
integrity
of
our
legal
structure
and
to
the
faith,
mr.
griswold
spoke
about
black
separatism.
i
mean
to
the
faith
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
remedy
fashioned
by
a
district
court
comport
with
the
momentous
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
which
is
to
be
assured.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
area
under
consideration
is
metropolitan
mobile
which
is
portrayed
on
this
map
behind
me
with
a
school
population
in
excess
of
50,000
students.
this
50,000
is
out
of
a
total
mobile
county
school
population
of
approximately
70,000
students.
the
black-white
ratio
in
metropolitan
mobile
is
almost
exactly
50-50.
in
the
system
as
a
whole,
city
and
rural,
the
black-white
ratio
is
about
60%
white,
40,000
students,
40%
black,
30,000
students.
85%
of
the
black
students
were
about
26,000
in
the
system
reside
in
metropolitan
mobile.
at
all
stages
of
the
litigation,
the
courts
and
the
parties
including
the
school
board
have
treated
metropolitan
mobile
as
a
separate
matter.
the
proceedings
which
have
resulted
in
this
writ
of
certiorari
focus
on
integration
of
the
elementary
schools
in
metropolitan
mobile
although
facts
just
furnished
to
us
by
respondents
and
set
forth
in
a
supplemental
brief
filed
saturday
indicates
the
junior
high
schools
and
the
high
schools
there
in
which
a
substantial
degree
of
integration
was
supposed
to
have
been
accomplished
are
in
very
substantial
measure
identifiably
black.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
in
this
school
system,
where
the
entire
spectrum
of
school
assignment
techniques
have
been
used
in
the
past
to
maintain
racial
segregation,
noncontiguous
zoning,
satellite
zoning,
pairing,
busing,
a
bewildering
array
of
deviations
in
grade,
structure,
portable
classrooms,
school
closings,
school
construction.
whether
those
techniques,
which
have
been
employed
in
the
service
of
segregation
now
ought
to
be
used
in
the
service
of
integration
or
is
the
sole
standard
to
be
an
innovation.
that
is
the
exclusive
employment
of
the
neighborhood
school,
whatever
that
means,
now
suggested
by
the
united
state’s
and
the
respondents
as
a
method
of
school
assignment
even
though
it
results
in
an
exceedingly
high
degree
of
racial
concentration.
some
children
have,
in
the
past
in
mobile
sometimes
been
assigned
on
the
basis
of
some
concept
of
neighborhood
among
a
number
of
other
assignment
factors,
but
as
the
sole
means
of
assignment,
it
is
an
innovation.
it
might
be
added
at
this
point,
at
least
i
would
like
to
add
at
this
point
parenthetically
an
answer
to
the
argument
which
emerges
from
this
sharp
departure
in
administration
which
was
anticipated
yesterday
by
counsel
for
the
charlotte
school
board
who
stated
and
by
mr.
blake
who
stated
today
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right.
that
seems
to
be
the
only
answer
to
this
series
of
facts
which
exists
here
in
mobile
and
in
the
other
case,
the
other
case
argued
earlier.
he
conceded
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right
was
the
only
answer
and
however
satisfying
that
aphorism
might
be,
a
brief
analysis
of
it,
we
submit,
illuminates
the
issues
in
this
case.
busing
to
segregate
was
indeed
wrong
so
was
noncontiguous
zoning,
portable
classrooms
and
so
forth
but
the
wrong
was
not
the
busing
or
the
zoning,
it
was
the
racial
segregation.
these
assignment
techniques
were
normal,
neutral,
administrative
means
of
implementing
a
governmental
policy,
in
this
case
an
unconstitutional
governmental
policy.
similarly,
transportation
and
the
various
other
aids
of
school
assignment
in
the
service
of
integration
are
neither
good
nor
bad,
it
considered
abstract.
they
are
similarly
instruments
in
the
service
of
disestablishing
an
unconstitutional
system.
the
question
under
review
is
this
court’s
judgment
of
june
--
is
the
fifth
circuit’s
judgment
of
june
8,
1970
as
modified
by
judgments
of
august
4
and
august
28,
1970.
these
were
the
ninth,
tenth
and
eleventh
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit
since
1963.
the
case
is
now
pending
there
on
further
appeal,
having
to
do
with
enforcement
of
the
transportation
and
faculty
portions
of
the
earlier
decree.
it
has
been
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
a
sufficient
number
of
times
so
that
the
docket
entries
alone
occupy
half
of
the
first
volume
of
this
record
and
throughout
these
proceedings,
a
vast
quantity
of
materials
have
accumulated.
nevertheless,
the
salient
facts
are
clear
and
they
are
not
complex
and
the
issues
confronting
the
court
are
clear.
the
essence
of
the
problem
is
revealed
in
statistics
filed
by
the
respondent
in
the
district
court
on
october
2nd,
a
week
ago,
last
friday
and
not
i
may
add
served
on
us.
respondent’s
document
has
been
reproduced
in
our
supplemental
brief,
filed
with
the
court
on
october
10th
and
analyzing
the
brief.
it
is
a
photocopy
of
their
document
in
our
own
brief.
and
what
i
am
about
to
describe
is
the
board’s
own
statistics
although
we
submit
that
upon
an
evidentiary
hearing
we
could
demonstrate
to
the
facts
are
far
worse.
the
fifth
circuit
plan
in
operation
according
to
their
statistics,
results
in
7,651
or
about
two
thirds
of
all
the
negro
school
children
of
metropolitan
mobile
attending
all
black
elementary
schools
using
the
fifth
circuit’s
definition
of
an
all
black
school
as
one
with
fewer
than
10%
white
students.
this
map
of
metropolitan
mobile
indicates
the
elementary
school
districts
in
that
portion
of
the
system.
it
is
approximately
10
miles
across
the
west
and
18
miles
from
north
to
south.
almost
all
black
children
are
separated
from
the
preponderant
white
portion
of
the
city
by
interstate
65.
this
is
the
separating
line,
this
is
the
black
section,
this
is
the
white
section.
the
all
black
zones
now
on
their
own
admissions
include
robins
which
is
all
black,
grant
which
is
all
black,
brazier
which
is
all
black,
palm
(ph)
which
is
all

stanton
road
which
is
all

fonde
which
is
all

owens
which
is
all

collier
(ph)
which
is
all

council
which
is

then
here
is
whitley
which
is
89%
blend,
all
black,
1%
from
the
fifth
circuit
definition
and
other
schools
ranging
from
64,
76
and
80%
black.
now,
these
districts
here,
using
again
a
definition
of
no
more
than
10%
black
students
are
all
white.
indian
springs

white,
forest
hill

fonde
all
white,
shepherd
all
white,
morningside
all
white,
merck
is
all
white,
westmont
all
white,
williams
all
white.
here
is
a
district
with
52%
white
drawn
from
an
all
black
enclave
here,
but
for
many
years
there
was
the
only
one
to
12
school
in
the
system,
the
school
being
one
to
12
so
that
it
would
absorb
all
the
black
children
in
that
area.
the
school
is
closed
and
now
they
go
to
school
over
there.
there
are
in
fact
some
small
percentage
of
white
students
living
in
some
of
the
90%
to
more
black
districts,
but
under
the
plan,
as
it
is
operated,
as
the
respondents
have
informed
the
district
court
for
reasons
that
we
do
not
know,
not
all
of
them
and
perhaps
none
of
them
are
attending
the
schools
to
which
they
are
assigned.
there
is
a
motion
pending
in
the
district
court
about
that
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
a
hearing.
moreover,
the
petition
which
we
took
to
this
court
involves
only
elementary
schools.
the
high
school
situation,
however,
under
actual
enrollment
figures
now
furnished
seems
far
worse
than
projected
in
the
government’s
plan
which
is
essentially
adopted
below.
as
page
three
of
our
supplemental
brief
indicates,
more
than
6700
negro
students
will
be
going
to
high
school
and
junior
high
school
in
all
black
schools.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
preponderant
number
of
black
students
in
metropolitan
mobile
will
be
spending
half
of
their
education,
the
elementary
years
in
all
black
schools
and
the
so
called
palliative
of
integrated
junior
high
and
high
school
education
which
does
not,
in
any
event
cure
denial
of
constitutional
rights
for
the
first
six
years,
will
in
fact
not
exist
for
them.
and
the
issue
is,
does
this
final,
this
is
a
final
desegregation
plan,
does
it
satisfy
the
fourteenth
amendment?
the
fourteenth
amendment
rule
as
most
recently
been
expounded
in
green
and
alexander
as
requiring
the
ending
of
the
last
vestiges
of
segregation
and
the
elimination
of
segregation,
root
and
branch.
and
we
submit
that
that
imperative
is
far,
exceedingly
far
from
having
been
satisfied.
now
the
justification
offered
by
respondent
and
the
united
states
for
leaving
racial
segregation
essentially
intact
in
metropolitan
mobile
is
that
the
result
is
required
by
neighborhood
schools.
in
assessing
the
so-called
neighborhood
school
zoning
of
mobile,
we
might
however
first
describe
the
methods
of
school
zoning
which
mobile
has
used
traditionally.
on
this
record,
the
school
district
buses
more
than
20,000
students
at
an
average
round
trip
of
30
miles
a
day.
most
of
the
busing
is
in
the
rural
area,
but
there
is
a
substantial
amount
at
shorter
distances
in
the
city
and
so
busing
is
hardly
foreign
to
mobile
education
and
this
figure
compares
fairly
well
with
the
fact
that
40%
of
all
american
school
children
are
bused
to
school.
some
of
this
busing
has
clearly
been
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
racial
segregation.
as
for
example,
when
approximately
600
black
students
were
bused
from
rural
saraland
down
to
around
this
area
to
an
all
black
school.
approximately
7000
students
in
the
western
part
of
mobile
over
here,
it’s
in
the
metropolitan
area,
are
bused
where
the
school
districts
are
large
and
the
distances
are
somewhat
greater
and
the
preponderant
part
of
the
white
population
lives.
but
the
point
is
that
busing
is
common
place
in
mobile
education.
mobile
has
in
the
past
regularly
used
noncontiguous
zoning.
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
pages
7
(a)
that’s
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
look
at
the
two
pages
of
colored
maps
there.
these
maps
were
prepared
by
the
united
states
and
have
been
adopted
from
their
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
zones
on
the
map
are
colored
in
a
way
so
that
all
parts
of
a
noncontiguous
zone
are
the
same
color
and
some
of
these
involve
so
called
satellite
zoning
and
some
of
it
involves
noncontiguous
pairing.
it
can
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
mobile
has
assigned
children
to
schools
on
anything
but
a
neighborhood
basis.
the
difference
is
of
course
this
map
depicts
a
period
in
which
noncontiguous
zoning
was
used
to
maintain
racial
segregation.
on
the
first
page,
for
example,
the
bright
pink
portions
constitute
a
single
school
zone
in
which
black
children
were
bused
in
the
northern
part
of
the
zone
to
the
pink
semi-circular
sections
in
the
right
side
which
is
the
saraland
situation
i
was
describing
a
moment
ago.
white
children
attended
a
single
school
from
the
blue
portion
of
the
map,
that
being
satellite
zoning.
there
was
a
school
in
one
part,
but
not
in
the
other.
but
the
corridor
between
the
two
sections
called
thomas
was
formed
because
blacks
lived
in
there
and
they
were
not
to
go
to
the
white
school.
on
the
next
page,
the
bright
red
portions
of
the
map,
again
just
taking
an
example,
constitute
a
white
school
zone
and
white
children
at
brookley
went
up
to
the
white
school
at
woodcock.
mr.
jack
greenberg
now?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
your
honor
you’re
going
to
have
difficulty
as
i
have
had
in
going
from
one
map
to
another
because
mobile
has
changed
its
school
assignment
system
so
frequently
and
so
much
from
year
to
year
that
zones
you
will
see
on
one
map,
mr.
justice,
one
year
will
not
be
on
the
map
for
the
subsequent
year
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
went
to
a
black
school
named
thomas
in
the
thomas
zone
at
that
time.
there
was
a
black
school
named
thomas
in
the
thomas
zone
between
whistler
and
parks
and
black
students
went
to
the
thomas
school
and
white
students
attended
school,
a
single
school
from
whistler
and
parks.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
the
outline
of
the
thomas
school
between
whistler
and
parks
is
all
in
white,
it’s
not
colored
in.
we’ve
colored
only
the
noncontiguous
zones.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
are
maps
that
i
believe
is
i
think
zoning
in
1964
and
1965.
it’s
a
composite
prepared
by
the
department
of
justice
for
those
two
years.
the
noncontiguous
zoning,
the
noncontiguous
zones
are
listed
on
page
19
(a)
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart,
for
each
of
the
years.
if
you
will
turn
there,
there
is
a
list
with
a
single
spaced
page
of
rather
small
type
which
lists
all
the
noncontiguous
zones
which
existed
in
the
mobile
school
system
and
by
year,
the
’63,
’64,
’65,
’65,
’66,
’67
that's
as
of
the
time
when
that
record
was
made.
now,
if
this
analysis
of
the
last
five
minutes
is
not
completely
laid
to
rest
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
notion
of
neighborhood
schools
in
mobile,
i
would
like
to
add
that
in
the
black
areas,
whenever
they
had
a
school
where
the
capacity
of
the
school
is
filled
up
by
black
children,
they
wanted
to
put
more
blacks
in,
they
added
portable
classrooms
and
the
records
show
that
with
respect
to
white
children,
they
did
the
same
thing.
the
capacity
of
a
school
can
determine
the
neighborhood
it
will
serve,
but
where
the
capacity
of
a
school
is
a
readily
expandable
thing
like
an
accordion,
almost
it’s
like
an
alice
in
wonderland,
what
is
the
capacity
of
the
school?
the
capacity
of
the
school
is
whatever
the
decision
of
the
school
board
decides
that
it
should
be.
in
fact
in
mobile,
portable
classrooms,
the
record
shows,
were
substantially
added
to
black
schools
while
white
schools
were
under
capacity
and
this
is
shown
by
respondent’s
report
which
is
on
page
208
of
the
appendix
and
in
appendix
d
to
our
brief.
appendix
d
to
our
brief
has
a
list
of
portable
classrooms
and
so
the
notion
of
neighborhood
has
somehow
related
to
a
fixed
capacity
of
school
while
we
would
submit
in
no
cases
applicable
here
is
ludicrous.
another
way
school
population
is
defined
is
by
grade
structure.
in
this
all
black
area
over
here,
which
is
called
hillsdale,
they
had
the
only
one
to
12
school
in
the
city
of
mobile
and
i
mentioned
that
earlier
because
that
absorbs
all
the
black
kids.
this,
for
example,
only
a
k-3
school
or
a
high
school
or
junior
high
school,
the
black
kids
will
then
have
to
go
to
schools
elsewhere.
that
school
ultimately
was
closed,
but
it’s
a
normal
and
quite
recent
assignment
practice
of
the
school
system.
elsewhere
in
this
system,
there
is
the
most
variegated
combination
of
great
structures.
an
expert
witness
said
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it.
in
our
brief
on
page
35,
there
is
just
a
summary
of
the
great
structures
which
they
have
used
in
15,
16,
17,
18
19,
25,
67,
68,
69,
610,
612,
7,
78,
79,
711,
712,
812
and
i
am
just
picking
them
out.
in
other
words,
the
notion
of
neighborhood
as
determined
by
the
capacity
of
a
school
serving
a
geographical
area
is
even
--
well,
it
is
a
concept
that
is
really
not
capable
of
definition,
certainly
in
this
case.
we
saw
in
the
swann
case,
the
charlotte
case
that
what
is
claimed
to
be
a
neighborhood
that
is
a
contiguous
zone
can
consist
of
something
like
the
shape
of
a
dumbbell,
two
large
round
areas
are
connected
by
a
connecting
bar.
the
connecting
bars
in
there,
it's
called
a
neighborhood
and
if
you
take
that
out,
it's
called
noncontiguous
zoning
and
not
a
neighborhood
school.
but
the
complexities
and
curiosities
of
the
neighborhood
school
system
in
mobile
are
even
more
fantastic
than
that.
the
record
will
show
that
mobile
school
officials
define
the
neighborhood
school
not
merely
in
geographical
terms
but
in
psychological
and
sociological
terms
as
well,
whatever
that
may
mean.
the
question
for
this
court
therefore
is
whether
in
a
school
system,
which
has
been
segregated
by
law
until
1954
and
which
remained
completely
segregated
until
1969
and
which
is
still
now
overwhelmingly
segregated
as
the
result
of
a
so-called
final
desegregation
plan
under
which
it
now
operates,
this
court,
supervising
district
courts
sitting
in
equity
should
fashion
an
effective
remedy
to
forever
end
the
unconstitutional
administration
of
the
school
system
so
far
as
race
is
concerned.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
an
effective
remedy
would
end
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
submit
it’s
not
the
job
of
the
district
court
to
keep
up
with
it,
on
its
own
initiative.
it’s
like
any
other
decree
in
equity
if
a
party
or
parties
come
to
the
court
with
a
pleading
setting
forth
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
and
the
court
will
examine
it
and
decide
whether
relief
should
be
granted.
but
the
court
is
not
going
to
replace
the
school,
but
ultimately
the
school
board
has
a
constitutional
duty,
having
taken
the
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution,
to
keep
up
with
this
kind
of
thing
and
the
district
court
may
or
may
not
be
called
upon
to
do
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
several
observations
in
an
effort
to
answer
that.
and
one
is,
in
a
city
like
mobile,
indeed
many
communities
which
may
come
before
a
court
or
this
court,
will
have
a
situation
in
which
the
constitution
has
been
violated
without
a
doubt
to
their
knowledge
from
1954
to
1969
and
it
may
be
not
asking
too
much
to
take
another
look
at
it
again
three
years
later.
it’s
not
as
if
they
have
been
thoroughly
well
integrated
for
a
hundred
years
and
then
someone
is
suddenly
calling
them
into
court.
secondly,
it
maybe
that
the
court
will
have
to
look
at
it
as
indeed
in
policing
an
antitrust
decree
or
a
water
rights
case
or
anything.
so
it
is
possible
and
then
a
judgment
will
have
to
be
made
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
as
your
question
implies,
will
a
period
arrive
sometime
in
history
in
which
the
court
will
no
longer
ever
have
to
look
at
it
again,
i
imagine
that
at
some
point
it
would
arrive,
but
now
one
year
after
mobile
has
first
taken
a
step
going
only
as
far
as
it
has,
i
suggest,
it's
premature
to
consider
that
question.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
again,
that’s
not
this
case,
but
i
don’t
want
to
evade
your
question
by
giving
that
kind
of
an
answer
to
it.
the
school
board
is
being
asked
to
take
affirmative
action
at
this
time
to
undo
a
long
history
of
quite
vigorously
enforced
discrimination
and
i
think
it
--
we’re
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case,
i
would
assume
that
in
a
period
of
three
years,
the
racial
segregation
which
has
been
so
virulent
and
has,
as
mr.
napier
(ph)
said
earlier,
in
a
part
of
american
history
there
is
slavery
for
a
hundred
years
and
segregation
for
a
hundred
more,
it
may
not
be
so
easily
uprooted.
it
maybe
the
court
will
have
to
look
at
it
again
and
see
whether
or
not
this
is
just
a
natural
movement
of
upward
mobility
to
get
a
house
with
an
additional
bedroom
or
is
related
to
something
else.
but
that's
on
a
record
that
i
haven’t
seen
and
no
one
has
seen.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
racial
balance
is
in
your
question,
not
in
my
statement
and
it’s
not
a
term.
i
think,
it
was
made
quite
clear
that
we
are
advancing
to
this
court.
the
solicitor
reads
our
brief
which
says,
we
disallow
racial
balance,
it
says
aha,
that
shows
they
are
for
racial
balance.
so
i
would
like
to
say
that
if
you’re
hypothesizing
a
case
of
racial
balance,
i’ll
answer
it
in
terms
of
the
hypothesis,
but
it
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
it’s
not
a
question
of
balance,
it's
all
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
any
figure
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
figure
which
i
mentioned
was
merely
describing
the
racial
population
just
so
the
court
would
have
an
understanding
of
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are.
i
was
not
proposing
any
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
did.
i
did
use
the
fifth
circuit
definition
as
describing
those
districts
and
the
school
that
i
call
all
black,
is
in
terms
of
fifth
circuit
definition
has
indicated
here,
90%
black.
yes,
that's
correct.
i
would,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
time
when
the
courts
can
divest
themselves
with
this
problem.
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
would
be
three
years
from
now.
but
it
would
be
at
some
time
and
we
don’t
know
when.
i
think,
only
experience
will
tell.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
they
are
wholly
private
decision
making
and
can
be
totally
divested
from
everything
else,
i
might
tend
to
agree
it
would
be
sooner
rather
than
later.
but,
i
think,
a
careful
examinations
of
records
indicate
frequently
that
what
is
taken
to
be
wholly
private
is
often
not
wholly
private.
i
think,
we
have
to
see.
but
on
the
hypothesis
that
it's
wholly
private
and
on
hypothesis
that
we
have
had
a
completely
desegregated
system
and
so
forth,
i
would
say
such
a
time
could
arrive.
i
was
beginning
to
say
that
the
question
for
this
court
as
we
see
it
on
this
record
is
whether
in
a
school
system
which
has
been
segregated
by
law
until
1954
and
which
remained
segregated
until
1969
and
which
is
now
still
overwhelmingly
segregated
as
the
result
of
a
so
called
final
desegregation
plan,
this
court,
supervising
district
court
sitting
in
equity
should
fashion
an
effective
remedy
to
forever
end
the
unconstitutional
administration
of
the
school
system,
so
far
as
race
is
concerned.
we
submit
that
this
court,
as
a
remedial
measure,
should
declare
a
rule
which
requires
that
every
black
child
at
every
grade
in
his
educational
career
must
be
free
of
assignment
to
a
racially
identifiable
minority
school
and
such
a
school,
in
language
of
our
brief
is
one
which
by
reason
of
a
very
considerable
concentration
or
disproportion
is
conceive
and
designed
to
receive
black
children.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
is
the
former
but
the
two
are
intertwined
because
you
do
not
get
to
disestablish
a
segregated
school
system
except
for
the
fourteenth
amendment,
unless
there
are
state
or
federal
legislation,
but
it
is
essentially
the
fourteenth
amendment
we
are
talking
about
in
cases
like
this.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
remedial
measure.
we
are
talking
about
a
remedy
but
frequently
from
remedies,
rights
do
stem,
in
an
antitrust
case,
you
may
get
a
right
to
license
or
a
right
to
the
government,
again
a
right
to
compel
divestiture,
which
is
a
remedy,
you
could
not
do
but
for
the
fact
of
a
certain
substance
of
violation.
however
it
is
a
remedy.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
you
are
limiting
your
question
to
areas
where
there
has
been
segregation
imposed
by
law
in
some
form?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
my
answer
is
no
and
i
have
to
explain
the
reason
for
the
answer,
so
i
would
be
sure
that
i
am
not
misunderstood.
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
essentially
raising
what
might
be
called
the
de
facto
question,
whether
where
there
has
been
no
de
jure
segregation
and
there
is
nevertheless
a
considerable
concentration
of
black
students
in
a
racially
identifiable
school,
nevertheless,
one
may
obtain
a
decree
from
a
federal
district
court
integrating
the
schools
according
to
the
measures
we
propose.
my
answer
to
that
is
we
require
some
finding
of
--
we
think
that
this,
the
rulings
of
this
court
require,
that
there
have
been
some
segregation
imposed
by
law.
we
think,
however
that
in
parts
of
the
country
which
are
normally
not
referred
to
south
are
out
of
south,
one
can
find
that
segregation
imposed
by
law
as
in
denver
and
in
new
rochelle
and
in
other
places
where
it
has
been
found
and
it
has
been
done
by
court
and
we
think
that
a
searching
record
in
other
places
would
turn
it
up
as
well.
we
will
assume
that
there
are
places
where
that
has
not
been
established
and
cannot
be
established.
and
in
those
places,
i
personally
would
be
willing
to
urge
a
court
that
the
same
remedy
should
apply.
it
would
be
on
a
different
basis,
not
this
case
and
i
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
concede
that's
an
open
question
and
hardly
the
thing
to
be
decided
here
today.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
correct.
in
that
case
one
would
have
to
find
a
substantive
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
is
a
case
we're
arguing
on
the
basis
of
remedy
and
i
would
readily
admit,
as
i
would
have
to,
a
fair
reading
of
the
cases
indicate
that
other
cases
an
open
question.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
mr.
justice
black
because
i
did
not
get
to
state
the
second
part
of
my
rule,
is
that
it
must
be
feasible
or
workable
and
as
you
described
the
case
without
really
understanding
the
situation
any
further,
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
that
would
be
feasible
or
workable.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i
mean
feasible
or
workable
to
integrate
the
school
is
what
i
am
referring
to.
one
would
have
to
find
some
workable
method
of
integrating
the
schools
there
and
at
least
the
case
is
put
to
me,
i
cannot
think
of
a
way
of
doing
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
well
that
is
the
second
part
of
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
would
i
give
the
same
answer
from
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
imagine
i
would
have
to,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
will
confess
that
i
like
perhaps
some
others
in
the
court
that
are
confused
about
the
feasible,
the
workable,
the
reasonable
test
and
i
think
we
have
to
focus
not
on
those
words
which
have
been
used
in
ways
that
make
them
so
inherently
confusing,
but
on
something
else
that
relates
to
them
and
that
is
first
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
green
use
feasible.
mr.
jack
greenberg
workable
was
used
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
carter
case,
the
feasible
using
green,
reasonable
is
in
the
fourth
circuit.
i
think
we
would
have
focus
on
something
else
as
these
words
that
are
being
used
are
getting
us
nowhere
and
i
think
we
want
to
focus
on
one,
the
result
to
be
achieved
and
the
result
is
the
elimination
of
the
all-black
school
and
workability
or
whatever
other
word
you
used
have
to
be
seen
in
that
context
and
then
the
casting
of
the
burden.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
so
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
also
seen
and
i
think
we
used
it
in
that
sense
also
in
terms
of
the
burden.
if
it
appears
it
can
be
done
as
a
very
heavy
burden
on
the
board
to
establish
that
it
cannot
be
done.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
possible
and
in
mobile
--
and
in
mobile
and
charlotte
and
in
athens
in
different
ways.
we
know
it’s
possible
in
athens
because
they
are
doing
it,
we
know
it’s
possible
in
charlotte,
it
happened
today.
we
know
it’s
possible
in
mobile
because
they
have
done
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
have
done
far
more
than
they
really
have
to
do.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
a
considerably
heavy
burden.
now
that
the
solicitor
had
said
that
we
are
arguing
some
theory
of
racial
balance,
he
has
read
the
clear
language
of
our
brief,
he
picked
it
up
and
he
read
it.
i
had
to
turn
to
it
because
i
thought
maybe
this
brief
had
been
changed
down
at
the
printer
or
something
when
he
said
well
see
therefore
racial
balance
and
i
was
really
scared
when
he
started
reading
that
because
i
thought
it
said
something
it
did
not
say,
but
it
says
what
it
was
supposed
to
say
that
in
the
unitary
school
system,
no
black
student
may
be
assigned
to
a
racially
identifiable
black
school
and
i
think
we
can
explain
it
at
considerable
length
that
that
does
not
mean
racial
balance
and
why.
as
we
understand
the
meaning
of
racial
balance,
it
means
that
every
school
has
to
reflect
approximately
the
percentage
of
students
in
the
same
ratio
as
their
ratio
in
the
overall
population.
in
metropolitan
mobile,
it
would
be
50-50.
in
charlotte
it
would
be
70-129
and
mr.
chambers
made
it
clear
yesterday
and
i
am
making
it
clear
now
that
that
is
not
what
we
are
arguing.
our
position
is
that
the
constitutional
obligation,
just
establish
a
dual
segregated
system
requires
at
least
that
the
resultant
schools
are
ones
which
are
not
so
overwhelmingly
black
when
considered
with
a
total
population
of
that
school
district,
that
it’s
considered
to
be
a
black
school.
and
we
differ
also
from
the
government
which
use
the
words
feasible
and
workable
as
we
have
in
that
we
focus
on
result.
we
say
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
suggest
that
a
most
heavy
burden
is
on
the
school
board
to
establish
that
a
means
to
end
segregation,
that
means
to
end
segregation
do
not
exist
and
the
plan
does
not
work.
in
mobile
it
is
workable
because
i
think
of
the
ten
techniques
they
have
used
if
they
picked
any
two
or
three
they
could
do
it
and
certainly
if
they
used
all
the
ten.
athens,
it’s
workable,
charlotte
it’s
workable.
mr.
justice
black’s
hypothesis,
i
would
assume
it’s
not
workable.
(inaudible)
so
it
is
not
workable,
but
we
have
this
case
here
and
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
--
that
it’s
difficult
enough
without
considering
all
the
cases
that
we
don’t
have
here.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
actually
that
interstate
is
the
boundary
between
a
number
of
school
districts.
it
is
the
boundary,
well
in
fact
that
school,
it
is
the
--
or
having
thought
of
it
that
way
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
it
is
a
common
school
boundary
for
a
large
number
of
school
districts.
well
they
have
moved
school
districts
around
all
over
the
place
and
i
think
they
would
just
--
one
way
of
doing
it,
not
that
they
have
to
reach
the
interstate
barrier,
they
might
do
a
variety
of
above.
actually,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
has
adopted
a
plan
called
alternative
b1
and
i
wanted
to
make
--
have
it
clearly
understood
that
we
are
not
urging
alternative
b1
upon
the
court.
alternative
b1
was
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
government
to
be
a
feasible
plan.
it
was
designed
by
hew.
it
was
one
of
four
plans
that
could
work
to
desegregate
mobile.
we
are
not
urging
it
upon
the
court
because
they
have
not
--
this
record
is
riddled
with
denials
of
hearings,
ex
parte
action,
the
facts
have
changed
and
it
is
entirely
possible
that
at
this
moment
it
would
not
be
an
appropriate
scheme
for
mobile,
but
it
is
approximately
the
sort
of
thing
which
can
do
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
thank
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
indeed
been
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
mobile
and
that
confusion
has
stemmed
in
considerable
part
from
the
fact
that
judge
thomas
has
not
given
hearings
in
any
of
these
plans
for
a
period
of
two
years
and
as
an
example,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
question
of
the
missing
students.
one
reason
why
there
are
some
missing
students
is
there
has
been
a
loss
of
population
of
approximately
17,000
over
the
past
few
years
in
mobile
because
of
the
closing
of
the
brookley
air
force
base
but
another
reason
is
that
there
is
something
down
there
known
as
non-conformers,
children
going
to
school
as
they
please,
where
they
please
in
violation
of
the
court
order.
mr.
cooper
and
i
went
in
to
see
judge
thomas
about
two
weeks
ago
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
non-conformers
and
he
said
he
would
set
it
for
some
time
in
november.
we
pointed
out
that
we
thought
there
was
some
urgency
to
setting
it
and
setting
it
soon
because
school
was
going
on
now
and
he
said
he
would
set
it
in
november
and
if
we
disagreed,
we
could
go
to
the
fifth
circuit.
that
is
why
we
have
had
confusion
in
mobile
and
why
it’s
very
difficult
to
understand
what’s
going
on.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
there
have
been
wholesale
transfers
of
students,
again
in
violation
of
the
order
and
only
last
week,
the
justice
department
was
able
to
get
a
hearing
before
judge
thomas
and
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
that
but
it
may
be
part
of
the
wholesale
transfers,
it
may
be
non-conformers.
so
far
as
the
[voice
overlap]
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
are
voluntary
transfers
granted
in
violation
of
where
the
assignments
ought
to
be
under
the
order.
now
alternative
b
one,
contrary
to
what
mr.
philips
and
mr.
stockman
say
is
not
a
plan
we’re
urging
upon
this
court.
because
we
cannot
urge
it
with
any
confidence,
there
has
never
been
a
hearing
on
that.
however,
it
is
a
general
notion
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
done
if
one
wants
to
assign
students
according
to
normal
systems
or
school
administration
of
mobile
and
end
up
with
an
integrated
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don’t
know.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don’t
know
mr.
chief
justice.
we’ve
been
unable
to
get
a
hearing.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
answer
is
i
just
don’t
know.
the
thing
that
we
have
focused
on
mostly
is
first
of
all
wholesale
transfers,
we
don’t
know
to
what
extent
they’re
voluntary.
if
they
are
involuntary,
we
don’t
know
whether
or
not
they
have
been
coerced
or
suggested
in
any
way.
we
do
know
there
are
large
numbers
of
so
called
non-conformers,
children
going
to
school
without
official
assignment,
just
attending
schools
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
a
hearing
and
there
is
indeed
confusion
down
there
but
i
can
describe
a
good
part
of
it
to
what
i’ve
just
said.
may
it
please
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
have
been
hearings
at
various
times.
the
plan
that’s
in
effect
was
put
in
following
a
pre-trial
conference
but
a
trial
was
never
held.
we
just
put
right
in
by
judge
thomas
without
a
hearing.
at
an
earlier
stage,
we
made
a
motion
to
the
court
that
this
thing
hadn’t
occurred
several
times,
saying
that
we
would
like
a
procedure
set
down
for
filing
objections
and
papers
and
having
a
hearing
and
it
was
denied
and
that’s
all
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
it’s
in
the
record.
may
it
please
the
court,
despite
the
considerable
disagreement
over
the
matters
discussed
in
the
last
moment
or
two;
there
has
been
nevertheless
a
remarkable
amount
of
agreement
among
the
parties
and
the
courts
below.
with
the
exception
of
the
more
plaintiffs
who
feel
that
nothing
at
all
ought
to
be
done
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
who
have
not
addressed
themselves
to
the
question
of
what
ought
to
be
done,
everyone
or
perhaps
everyone
appears
to
agree
that
race
can
and
must
be
taken
into
account
to
undo
the
effects
of
the
jury
segregated
school
system.
the
fifth
circuit
has
moved
lines
and
it
has
gerrymandered,
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
that
and
indeed
in
the
swann
case
itself
has
approved
busing
and
noncontiguous
zoning
for
junior
high
school
and
high
school
students.
the
solicitor
general
advocates
gerrymandering
when
it
feels
it’s
appropriate,
building
schools,
closing
schools.
charlotte
school
board
believes
it
can
gerrymander
in
the
face
of
the
advice
of
its
counsel
but
its
counsel
thinks
it
can
locate
schools
but
not
move
school
zone
lines.
the
athens
board
believes
it
can
do
what
it
calls
pocket
busing
which
is
what
we
call
noncontiguous
zoning
or
clustering.
judge
mcmillan
believes
that
relief
should
be
effective
and
he
should
use
a
variety
of
techniques
to
achieve
a
result
of
no
identifiable
negro
school.
we
urge
in
the
mobile
case
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed,
that
the
case
be
sent
back
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
alexander
against
holmes
county
for
hearings
and
a
timetable
i
suggest
to
pay
alexander
but
a
plan,
not
alternate
of
b1
devised
by
hew
but
a
plan
of
that
general
nature,
using
the
techniques
that
have
been
available
in
mobile
be
employed
and
that
the
test
be
one
of
results
not
anything
else.
now,
i
would
say
in
further
response
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
of
yesterday
which
was
essentially
when
can
the
federal
courts
get
out
of
this
business.
that
is
the
federal
courts
will
get
out
of
this
business
as
soon
as
the
results
are
achieved
with
an
identifiable
clear
test
is
decided
upon
and
people
know
what
they
have
to
do
where
in
mobile,
as
an
extreme
example,
they
haven’t
had
the
slightest
(inaudible).
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don’t
believe
he
did
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
would
not
urge
that,
we
do
not
urge
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
certainly
in
many
cases
that
would
be
satisfied.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
then
have
to
look
at
the
workability
test
in
one
aspect
of
that
at
the
general
distribution
of
population
the
community
and
another
aspect.
i
think
judge
mcmillan
handled
it
quite
pragmatically,
he
had
a
4%
school
and
he
had
a
40%
school.
he
did
not
insist
upon
a
rigid
ratio,
we
don’t
but
just
as
in
the
jury
cases
which
have
been
spoken
about
which
i
think
are
really
not
appropriate
in
many
respects,
the
universe
is
larger,
you’re
not
dealing
with
12
people,
you’re
dealing
with
900
people.
you
do
look
at
the
numbers
to
get
some
idea
of
whether
or
not
there’s
been
to
wide
a
deviation.
it’s
impossible
to
come
to
a
judgment
without
looking
at
the
numbers
and
a
90-10
district
would
be
one
thing
and
a
50-50
district
would
have
to
be
another,
you
can’t
avoid
them.
mr.
jack
greenberg
you’re
entirely
right
mr.
chief
justice
and
judge
johnson
in
the
carr
against
montgomery
county
school
board
of
education
case
in
which
he
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
in
turn
reversed
by
this
court
and
judge
johnson’s
orders
reinstated.
he
set
up
a
ratio
and
i
think
it
was
a
60-40
ratio
if
i
recall
correctly
and
allowed
a
15%
deviation
because
he
needed
something
he
could
administer.
when
he
was
talking
to
the
school
district
there
in
terms
of
generalities
and
not
in
terms
of
results,
it
just
didn’t
work.
when
he
had
something
he
could
administer,
he
then
had
something
that
was
clear
they
had
an
order
they
knew
they
could
follow
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
has
worked
very
well.
not
only
there
but
in
hundreds
of
districts
around
the
country.
may
it
please
the
court
16
years
have
passed
since
the
first
brown
decision
was
handed
down
by
this
court
and
in
mobile
as
in
hundreds
of
cities
and
towns
across
the
south,
black
children
born
in
the
year
of
that
decision
have
completed
their
entire
public
school
careers
without
ever
attending
a
segregated
school.
in
the
record
by
district
resistance
of
the
constitution
is
well
known
to
this
court
and
i
will
not
repeat
it
here.
but
i
do
urge
upon
this
court
that
now,
in
1970,
last
begins
to
appear
than
more
than
a
decade
and
a
half
of
litigation
is
bearing
fruit
in
desegregation
decreased
whether
litigated
or
consented
to.
it
is
essential
to
the
integrity
of
our
legal
structure
and
to
the
faith,
mr.
griswold
spoke
about
black
separatism.
i
mean
to
the
faith
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
remedy
fashioned
by
a
district
court
comport
with
the
momentous
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
which
is
to
be
assured.
thank
you.
