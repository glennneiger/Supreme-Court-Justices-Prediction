mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
i
present
argument
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
mobile
county
council’s
pta
which
is
an
association
of
the
pta
associations
of
the
various
schools
in
the
system.
pta
getting
to
this
chase
as
an
intervenor,
i
think
mr.
philips’
statement
in
the
record
in
this
case
will
indicate
the
problem
that
the
pta
or
the
members,
the
parents,
the
teachers
and
the
students
were
faced
with.
the
number
of
changes
that
we
have
seen
in
the
last
few
months
is
absolutely
devastating.
i
don’t
think
anyone
of
us
in
this
courtroom
could
live
with
the
changes
that
these
people
have
had
to
face
and
each
one
was
highly
publicized
in
the
newspaper
because
that
was
part
of
the
order.
when
the
district
court
made
a
change,
it
was
publicized
and
each
of
the
parents
get
rid
of,
now
my
child
is
going
to
school,
he
have
had
one
over
here,
one
over
there
and
one
over
here.
next
month,
next
week
sometimes,
there
would
be
revision
either
by
the
district
court
or
by
the
court
of
appeals.
so
we
intervene
in
the
case
on
a
number
of
grounds.
i
think
basically
we
were
concerned
with
the
fact
that
the
people
in
mobile
wanted
the
neighborhood
concept.
they
wanted
neighborhood
schools,
they
wanted
to
convene
--
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
and
by
neighborhood
schools,
we’re
talking
about
community.
mobile
as
you
might
--
mr.
philips
may
have
pointed
out
and
i
would
like
to
reiterate
a
couple
of,
just
a
couple
of
points
that
the
concentration
of
the
colored
or
black
population
plus,
if
you
might,
if
you
will
right
in
this
area,
right
through
here
with
a
few
engine.
this
is
a
densely
populated
black
area.
mobile
is
a
red
light
city
or
the
metropolitan
areas
were
the
large,
155
square
miles
in
the
city
itself.
but
all
the
concentration
on
those
things
makes
it
more
difficult.
it
is
the
fact
that
on
this
side,
if
you
like
to
see
all
this
water,
this
is
none
but
marsh
land
and
river
water,
one
town
going
on
the
river
to
mobile
county
and
i
want
this
at
one
bridge.
i
mean
this
is
just
a
demarcation
physical
impossibility
and
nestled
against
the
bank
of
all
this
water
is
a
black
community,
see.
and
all
the
rest
of
the
county
and
the
city
is
located
to
the
west
and
to
the
north
and
to
the
south.
so
the
difficult
problem
is
not
even
like
the
charlotte
case
which
had
the
community
and
nestled
in
the
middle
where
you
could
go
out
in
two
directions,
four
directions
at
least.
in
addition
to
that,
since
we’re
on
a
junior
high
level,
you
can
see
why
washington
and
i
don’t
know
whether
you
justices
can
see
as
well
but
getting
up
a
little
higher,
this
zone
right
here
is
the
washington
zone
which
mr.
philips,
jr.
and
mr.
greenberg
have
both
discussed,
the
fact
that
people
didn’t
even
attempt.
what
you
will
see,
the
school
is
sitting
way
up
here
on
a
predominantly
colored
neighborhood
then
you
will
notice
right
here,
this
large
population
of
students
here
that
previously
went
to
one
of
these
other
schools,
either
right
here
across
to
a
few
blocks
so
here
are
few
block
now
travel
as
much
as
12
in
outmost
to
get
there
in
possible.
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
i
said
on
the
12-15
miles
just
around
streets
to
get
there
and
the
heavy
traffic
at
the
most
--
the
time
of
day
which
is
impossible.
i
think
this
court
is
faced
with
one
simple
problem
and
i
say
simple
problem,
it’s
very
complex
but
i
think
it’s
come
to
time
that
we’re
going
to
have
to
face
up
to
the
real
issue,
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
right
of
the
individual,
he
has
any
constitutional
right
at
all
to
determine
where
he
goes
to
school.
maybe
that’s
only
the
simple
fact
but
i
think
the
real
issue
--
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
i
would
think
that
in
the
context
of
my
client,
the
parent-teacher
association,
every
school
is
a
neighborhood
school.
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
because
in
mobile—
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
i
mean
it
from
the
standpoint
of
my
client.
when
i
say
that
simply
this,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
that
every
parent
feels
an
obligation
to
participate
in
the
educational
institution
to
which
his
child
attends
and
this
is
an
obligation
that
you
feel
in
mobile
i
guess
as
much
as
any
other
community.
that
they
feel
an
obligation
to
participate
as
a
community
in
every
school
and
no
matter
which
school
it
is,
whether
it’s
biracial
or
whether
it’s
uniracial.
they
participate
in
the
activities
and
the
tragedy
of
the
whole
thing
is
as
if
mr.
russell
pointed
out,
is
that
these
people,
some
of
them,
we
are
losing
out
of
the
schools,
mobile
is
losing
to
private
schools
and
otherwise.
some
of
the
people
who
are
leaders,
their
parents
would
otherwise
be
leaders
and
instruments
in
causing
these
schools
to
become
a
part
of
the
community.
even
an
underprivileged
child
under
the
structure
of
the
pta
council,
any
given
school
receive
many
benefits
from
the
council
itself
or
from
the
pta
itself
because
of
the
fact
that
making
people
more
interested
are
more
instrumental
in
the
school
and
a
parent
who
has
to
take.
now,
look
at
the
white.
if
we
attack
the
issue
squarely
before
the
court
as
i
see
it
in
this
case
is
not
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
child
is
bused
1
mile
or
2
miles
or
4
miles
or
20
miles.
the
issue
is
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
of
the
individual
to
be
compelled
to
attend
any
particular
school
so
we
own
the
basis
of
race.
we
need
no
nothing
else
but
one
thing
to
make
the
sign
what’s
on
the
plans
sought
by
the
petition,
that
is
save
the
race
of
the
child.
if
you
know
the
race
of
the
child,
we
can
assign
but
without
we
cannot.
and
this
is,
this
is
being
made
this
whole
basis
of
this
whole
plan.
the
school
board,
the
courts
and
they
have
time
for
this
problem
for
seven
years
and
it’s
a
physical
impossibility
to
convene,
put
children
in
schools
under
the
plan
proposed
by
the
petitioners.
and
i
say
that
and
this,
there
is
no
act
with
public
transportation
in
mobile,
the
transportation
company
went
broke
and
collapsed
and
the
city
picked
up
the
transportation
system
in
its
hands
and
now
running
with
extreme
deficits.
there
is
no
adequate
busing
facility.
the
busing
is
a
minimal
amount
of
busing
done
in
the
semi-suburban
area
simply
because
people
live
so
far
from
the
schools
and
they’re
built
because
the
schools
don’t
accommodate
them,
and
the
county
of
this
busing
has
an
old
rural
county.
but
at
the
same
time,
we
held
a
problem
here
of
the
people
in
the
system
getting
their
children
to
school
under
this
plan
because
every
child,
every
child
would
have
to
be
bused
in
every
grade,
almost
under
system
and
they
just
don’t
have
adequate
buses,
we
are
dealing
with
a
$2
million,
$3
million
budget
which
mobile
does
not
have.
i
like
to
just
close
by
saying
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
yes.
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
no
sir,
its
whites
and
colored.
i
might
clarify
that
mr.
justice
black
and
that
there
was
in
the
past
under
the
dual
system
two
different
associations.
they’ve
had
some
trouble
getting
together
in
their
representation
and
as
a
result,
our
organization
representatives
making
up
three
members
from
each
school
that
represented
all
blacks
and
whites
and
so
the
pta
council
that
we
represent
does
have
all
the
council,
the
council
organization,
three
representatives
in
each
school
consists
of
blacks
and
whites.
and
we
just
asked
the
court
to
consider
the
fundamental
constitutional
issues,
the
feasibility
test,
the
reason
for
this
test
or
any
other
test
which
might
be
applied.
first
of
all
we
must
apply
with
one
question
whether
or
not
that
test
violates
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
individual
who
has
an
individual
right,
a
constitutional
right
to
not
to
be
forced
to
go
to
the
school
or
exclude
from
the
school.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
i
present
argument
on

of
the
respondents
mobile
county

grade,
almost
under
system
and
they
just
don’t
have
adequate
buses,
we
are
dealing
with
a
$2
million,
$3
million
budget
which
mobile
does
not
have.
i
like
to
just
close
by
saying
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
yes.
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
l.
stockman
no
sir,
its
whites
and
colored.
i
might
clarify
that
mr.
justice
black
and
that
there
was
in
the
past
under
the
dual
system
two
different
associations.
they’ve
had
some
trouble
getting
together
in
their
representation
and
as
a
result,
our
organization
representatives
making
up
three
members
from
each
school
that
represented
all
blacks
and
whites
and
so
the
pta
council
that
we
represent
does
have
all
the
council,
the
council
organization,
three
representatives
in
each
school
consists
of
blacks
and
whites.
and
we
just
asked
the
court
to
consider
the
fundamental
constitutional
issues,
the
feasibility
test,
the
reason
for
this
test
or
any
other
test
which
might
be
applied.
first
of
all
we
must
apply
with
one
question
whether
or
not
that
test
violates
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
individual
who
has
an
individual
right,
a
constitutional
right
to
not
to
be
forced
to
go
to
the
school
or
exclude
from
the
school.
thank
you.
