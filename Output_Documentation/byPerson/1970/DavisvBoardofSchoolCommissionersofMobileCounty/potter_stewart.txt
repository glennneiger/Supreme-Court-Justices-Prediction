and
when
was
this
zoning
planned?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask,
mr.
greenberg
a
question
that
i
asked
yesterday
in
somewhat
different
context.
i
understand
your
position,
a
position
that's
spelled
out
very
clearly
in
your
brief,
and
it
is
addressed
very
clearly
orally
here,
but
is
it
your
position
that
that
is
a
test
that
must
be
met
in
remedying
and
rectifying
a
previously
dual
school
system
on
the
one
hand
or
is
it
your
position
that
that’s
a
test
that
is
required
substantively
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
regardless
of
the
history
of
a
particular
school
system?
justice
potter
stewart
well
so,
then
do
i
understand
that
it
is
not,
so
you
do
not
plan,
that
it
is
the
personal,
individual,
constitutional
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
a
negro
public
school
child
to
attend
throughout
his
school
career,
a
school
that
is
not
racially
identifiable?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
not
limiting
my
question.
i
‘m
asking
you
whether
it's
your
position
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
confers
upon
every
school
child
in
the
united
states
and
particularly
every
negro
public
school
student
the
right
to
attend
racially
non-identifiable
schools
throughout
their
school
careers,
throughout
their
school
career?
justice
potter
stewart
then
it's
not
a
remedy.
then
it's
a
substantive
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
that
case,
it
would
not
be
a
remedy
to
rectify
an
illegal
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
a
personal
substantive
constitutional
right,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
hypothetical
case?
justice
potter
stewart
by
feasible,
as
i
understand,
you
mean
possible?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
formulation
would
be
if
it
is
possible
and
you
put
the
burden
on
the
school
board
to
show
it
is
impossible,
isn’t
that
about
it?
