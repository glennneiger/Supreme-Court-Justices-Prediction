justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
all
we
have
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
evidence
and
was
there
a
fine
or
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
them
had
a
$30.00
fine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
based
on
evidence
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
shouldn’t
we
have
that
and
determine
what
this
court
was
deciding
was
annoying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
just
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
it’s
--
i
presume,
you
would
agree
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
we
should
give
a
narrowing
definition
to
the
words
annoying,
so
that
it
included
nothing
except
somebody
standing
on
the
street
and
blocking
people
passing
by
on
the
street,
and
that
would
make
the
statute
valid,
wouldn’t
it,
if
the
court
limited
it
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i’m
worried
about
is
how
do
we
know
that
that
wasn’t
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
had
been
there
and
not
only
disturbed
the
blocks
sidewalk,
hit
people
passing
by,
i
presume
that
would
be
sufficient
to
hold
that
the
statute’s
valid,
as
applied
to
those
facts
whether
the
court
said
it
was
narrowing
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
might
not
have
been.
i
presume
that
the
state
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
make
that
a
crime
of
loitering
or
blocking
the
streets
like
it
had
it
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
shouldn’t
we
have
some
knowledge,
have
some
knowledge
about
the
evidence
to
see
what
will
you’re
construing,
the
statute
applied
to
so
is
to
make
it
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
total
amount
involved
in
this
case
$30.00?
justice
hugo
l.
black
remitted
them
all,
but
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
imagine
the
state
wouldn’t
let
that
work
very
long?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
imagine
the
state
wouldn’t
let
that
work
very
long,
because
somebody
would
be
pleading
from
a
jeopardy
on
murder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
thing
it
bothers
me
in
the
argument
is
that
you
agree
and
i
think
correct
that
a
statute
can
be
construed
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
the
facts
and
there
were
some
facts
here
that
they
heard,
and
we
don’t
know
what
there
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
appellant
should
have
it
somewhere,
shouldn’t
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
appealed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
appealed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
reciting
the
facts
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they’re
not
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
could
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
could
you
if
it’s
the
same
conduct
and
it’s
been
tried
or
convicted
with
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
again
by
giving
it
a
different
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
of
chance
or
any
--
could
it
have
gone
into
court
anyway
and
put
facts
and
say
yes
so
that
we
could
know
what
they
have
held
was
annoying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn’t
the
city
have
brought
up
the
other,
suppose
it
had
a
motion
to
include
the
facts
in
the
record?
couldn’t
it
not
do
so
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn’t
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
both
of
are
to
be
blamed
for
not
having
the
facts
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
ordinarily
true,
but
we
frequently
have
the
other
side
make
motions
to
amend
the
record
and
something
in
it.
i’m
not
trying
to
impose
any
liability
on
the
city,
should
be
there.
but
we
have
in
the
case
where
it
seems
that
both
sides
had
met
that
a
statute
maybe
held
constitutional
on
its
face,constitutional
as
apply.
here,
you
find
that
there
are
some
things
that
could
be
annoying
if
it
make
the
statute
valid,
some
things
or
some
people
would
feel
annoyed
and
other
wouldn’t
that
the
court
rule
and
make
it
valid.
and
so,
we’re
here
without
any
chance
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
valid
as
applied,
aren’t
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
this
is
in
part
of
labor
dispute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i’m
sure
the
picketing
was
annoying
to
the
employer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
don’t
have
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you’re
not
claiming
your
argument
to
the
law
would
be
good.
you
made
it
a
crime
for
one
man
to
annoy
his
neighbors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you’re
not
claiming
are
you
that
would
be
a
valid
crime
if
it
said
nothing
in
the
word
except
that
it
shall
be
a
crime
in
the
state
for
one
man
to
annoy
his
neighbor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
here
is
a
case
where
the
word
could
have
a
good
meaning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
could
make
the
statute
valid
under
the
rule,
but
you
don’t
have
the
facts?
now
the
problem
is
what
we
do
with
a
case
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
should
we
affirm
it
or
to
dismiss
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
the
activity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
means
exactly
about
webster
says,
you
think
that
all
things
that
were
annoyed
people,
two
or
three
people
would
make
--
could
be
made
a
crime?
suppose
it
means
exactly
what
webster
says?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
fine
--
you
finally
get
back
to
finding
at
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there’s
a
lot
of
reasonable
man,
i
think
they’re
reasonable
throughout
the
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
take
my
brother
marshall’s
suggestion
would
--
a
very
much
annoyed
by
people
smoking
cigarettes
in
there
presence?
could
that
be
made
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
the
word
annoy
would
be
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
the
word
annoyed
would
be
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so,
you’re
talking
now
but
as
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
a
definite
state
which
said
conduct
to
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
all
we
have

the

one

a
