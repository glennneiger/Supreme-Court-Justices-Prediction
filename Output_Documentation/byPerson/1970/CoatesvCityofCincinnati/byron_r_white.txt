justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
conviction
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
there
a
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
directly?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
evidence
must
have
represented
by
the
state
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
know
what
conduct
the
appellant’s
were
found
guilty
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
although
would
you
suggest
that
there
are
some
facts
in
the
world
that
anybody
could
realize
or
might
be
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
your
clients
were
guilty
of
precisely
that
conduct
which
any
fool
would
know
would
violate
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
--
they
were
charged
under
the
statute
and
let’s
assume
the
evidence
at
the
trial
showed
the
conduct
which
anybody
would
know
was
covered
by
the
statute,
there
couldn’t
be
much
doubt
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
really
is
that
there
is
nothing,
no
conduct
that
you
can
think
of
that
would
be
annoying?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
your
clients
gathered
on
the
street
and
engaged
in
precisely
that
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
that
it
may
--
that
conduct
may
have
violated
some
other
statutes,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
violated
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
conduct
you
concede
that
anybody
would
say
was
annoying?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
there
wouldn’t
be
any
doubt
in
the
minds
of
someone
engaging
in
that
conduct
that
it
was
the
kind
of
conduct
that
was
clearly
proscribed
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
could
--
oh,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
the
different
--
that’s
a
--
i
understand
that
argument.
what
you
really
saying
that
is
that
even
if,
even
if
this
defendant
knew
precisely
and
had
plenty
of
notice
that
his
conduct
was
covered
by
the
statute,
nevertheless
the
contours
of
annoyance
are
so
vague
in
general
that
the
statute
should
be
stricken
down
and
the
state
should
not
even
be
able
to
prosecute
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
those
people
whose
conduct
is
clearly
covered
by
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn’t
you
bring
the
--
why
is
it,
why
does
that
the
record
have
the
facts
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
ordinance
that
it
didn’t
reach
the
facts
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
that
--
let’s
assume
then
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
gathering
in
this
case
was
in
the
middle
of
the
street
in
the
rush
hour,
it
did
impede
traffic
and
they
were
charge
under
this
particular
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
the
assumption
there
was
plain
obstruction
of
traffic
and
they
were
charge
and
convicted
and
in
this
ordinance,
you
would
--
and
if
those
facts
where
in
the
record,
you’d
still
be
making
precisely
the
same
argument
you’re
making
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
this
was
annoyance
and
everybody
knew
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
nevertheless,
you
cannot
use
this
particular
ordinance
against
this
kind
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
said
it,
its
annoyance.
everybody
knows
its
annoyance?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
i
have
to
find
out
what’s
your
argument
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
have
control
it.
you
certainly
don’t
lose
your
case
just
because
you
say
or
concede
even
for
blood
that
blocking
traffic
is
annoyance
that
any
fool
would
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
tell
me
why
can’t
a
man
who
engages
in
that
conduct
be
convicted
under
this
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
some
other
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
some
other
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
enough
for
you
to
think
that
the
ordinance
should
be
stricken
down
to
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
perhaps
the
most
unfortunate
part,
of
there
not
being
any
facts,
is
we
can’t
even
tell
whether
this
is
a
speech
case
or
it
isn’t
a
speech
case.
whether
it’s
in
the
area
of
communications
or
not
and
there
are
decisions
that
court
could
say
defendants
have
standing
the
challenge
the
application
of
statute
to
other
people
than
themselves
in
speech
cases,
but
the
law
is
quite
the
contrary
in
non-speech
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
really
are
talking
vagueness
and
not
overbreadth,
is
that
what
you’re
talking
about?
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
on
vagueness,
it
seems
to
me
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it’s
easy
to
imagine
things
that
anybody
would
agree
is
annoying?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can’t
summon
the
fact
that
you
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
that
fellow
moves
to
committing
that
before
it
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
--
you
remember
--
it
seems
they've
been
--
the
state
seems
they’ve
been
willing
to
have
the
statute
judged
on
its
face
without
any
reference
to
the
facts
since
you
never
altered
the
facts,
you
never
certified
them
to
your
state
courts
and
you’re
quite
willing
to
have
the
decision
made
about
the
validity
of
the
statute
based
just
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
that
you’re
not
only
willing
to
have
that
done
here,
but
you
want
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
heard?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
face
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
concede
at
all
that
in
some
applications,
somebody
might
have
some
real
doubt
about
whether
he
was
annoying
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
was

a

in
this
