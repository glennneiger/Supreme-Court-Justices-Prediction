mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
concerns
a
cincinnati
ordinance
which
is
called
the
loitering
ordinance,
but
which
is
really
more
an
unlawful
assembly
type
piece
of
legislation.
the
ordinance
provides
that
when
in
the
company
of
two
or
more
other
people,
one
so
conducts
himself
as
to
annoy
persons
passing
by,
a
crime
is
committed,
unless
that
conduct
takes
place
at
the
public
meeting
of
citizens,
in
which
case,
it
is
not
crime.
hamilton
county,
ohio
includes
cincinnati
and
the
number
of
other
municipalities
and
several
of
them
have
also
had
ordinances
using
similar
language.
in
the
1940,
the
common
police
court
for
hamilton
county
which
has
county
wide
jurisdiction
held
that
the
language
used
made
the
legislation
unconstitutional.
all
over
ohio,
the
courts
reached
the
same
conclusion
through
the
years
and
in
1968,
the
appeals
court
for
the
cleveland
area
wrote
in
detail
at
length
and
with
emphasis
how
the
lack
of
ascertainable
standards
made
the
annoyance
test
in
the
cleveland
ordinance
cause
it
to
represent
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power,
and
it
was
therefore
void
for
vagueness.
that
opinion
is
quoted
at
length
at
pages
5
and
6
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
was
written
by
the
same
judge
who
in
1970,
he
wrote
so
strongly
to
the
opposite
effect
in
a
4
to
3
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
this
case
of
coates
versus
cincinnati.
but
at
least
between
1940
and
1968,
the
annoyance
test
was
considered
to
be
void
for
vagueness.
indeed
in
1962,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
held
that
a
dog
barking
ordinance
which
used
the
annoyance
test
was
void
for
vagueness.
but
in
1967
during
the
summer,
cincinnati
along
with
many
other
areas
had
racial
disturbances,
and
the
police
and
perhaps
more
significantly,
other
city
officials
frequently
found
themselves
irritated
or
provoked,
annoyed
by
the
conduct
of
those
who
complained
and
those
who
disturbed.
and
members
of
the
city
government
including
police
were
not
able
to
charge
many
of
those
who
irritated
them
with
trespass
or
assault
and
battery
or
profanity
or
disorderly
conduct.
so
the
officials
and
the
police
who
were
beset
by
annoyance
which
webster’s
collegiate
dictionary
in
the
7th
edition
defines
as
a
wearing
on
the
nerves
by
persistent
petty
unpleasantness,
they
arrested
those
who
provoke
them
and
hold
them
away
and
that
ended
the
annoyance
for
a
very
short
time,
because
that
use
of
that
legislative
language
making
annoyance
a
crime,
directly
results
in
contempt
for
our
system
of
law
and
order,
or
i
think
more
properly
law
and
order
with
the
justice.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
there
was
a
trial.
actually,
there
are
two
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
at
the
trial,
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
there
was
evidence
of
the
type
your
honor,
means
refers
to
presented.
the
case
did
not
come
up
on
the
facts.
the
only
--
i
believe
mr.
nichols
can
correct
me,
i
believe
the
facts
--
i
have
to
correct
myself
--
i
believe
the
facts
were
presented
to
the
trial
court
to
some
degree
but
no
effort
was
made
to
incorporate
them
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
and
they
have
not
going
to
part
of
the
appeal.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
that’s
why
i
had
to
correct
myself
when
i
was
addressing
myself
to
what
we
have
here
and
we
have
not
come
up
on
any
facts,
if
your
honor
please.
other
then
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes,
yes,
i
certainly
do.
but
i
maintain
this
statute
is
so
broad
and
i’ve
attempted
to
cite
the
cases
that
illustrate
that
the
cases
--
decisions
of
this
court.
i
maintain
that
that
annoyance
is
so
broad
that
even
though
there
maybe
factual
circumstances
which
could
properly
be
used
for
a
valid
conviction,
we
can’t
take
a
chance
on
that.
it’s
too
dangerous
to
allow
this
annoyance
thing
and
the
inconvenient
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
then
they
should
have
been
charged
with
it,
whether
be
obscene
discourse
or
disorderly
conduct
or
assault
and
battery
or
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
have
to
disagree,
your
honor.
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
can
just
find
what
annoyance
is.
i’m
sure
you
and
i
would
have
difference
standards
of
annoyance.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
we
have
to
apply
a
certain
degree
of
reason
there.
i’m
sure
that
you
and
i
or
anyone
in
this
room
could
designate
certain
conduct
as
annoying.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
then,
they
should
have
been
--
that
conduct
would
then
have
also
been
as
i
understand
the
basic
idea
of
criminal
law
only
those
acts
which
in
legislation
are
crimes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
say
that
that
does
not
of
itself
granting
which
your
honor
says
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
--
granting
what
your
honor
says.
i
say
it
is
too
dangerous
to
allow
that
broad
general
characterization
of
conduct
to
be
a
tool
in
the
hands
if
you
will
of
lazy
policemen,
who
were
still
on
the
level
of
official.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
i’ve
to
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
i
have
to
agree
completely
with
what
you
just
said,
yes
sir.
and
in
that
connection,
there
are
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
over
the
years
which
go
in
two
different
areas.
one
is
the
area
that
you
have
just
alluded
to,
and
the
other
is
the
area
where
there
is
a
permissible
interpretation,
and
that
those
cases
are
far
more
sophisticated
than
the
argument
i’m
attempting
to
present
here.
i’m
trying
to
state
the
single
issue
you
phrased.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
find
that
a
very
difficult
question
which
i’ve
been
anticipating
for
some
months.
it’s
easy
for
me
to
say
your
honor
that
i
didn’t
get
the
hold
of
this
case
until
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
decided,
but
candor
compels
me
to
indicate
that
i’ve
a
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
ordinance,
not
statute,
these
are
ordinance,
if
this
ordinance
was
ever
to
get
an
authoritative
interpretation,
it
had
to
come
up
on
the
law
alone
and
not
on
the
facts
because
for
years,
the
local
officials
have
been
running
people
and
holding
them
and
turning
them
lose
and
the
local
--
the
lower
courts
have
been
finding
them
not
guilty
on
the
facts.
the
perfect
example
is
the
lathan
johnson
case
which
is
in
appendix
to
my
brief
here.
it’s
a
very
short
opinion
and
that’s
the
one
who
started
all
this.
it
arose
out
of
the
1967
racial
disturbances,
and
i
tried
that
case
and
the
state
court
of
appeals
said
when
they
reversed,
they
said,
this
is
probably
unconstitutional
this
ordinance
but
we
don’t
have
to
decide
that
and
you
see
by
doing
that,
they
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
we
have
the
facts
there
and
they
said
there
weren't
any
facts
to
support
the
conviction.
i
tried
that
case
--
it
came
up
on
full
bill
of
exceptions.
but
you
see,
that’s
the
pernicious
part
of
this
thing
by
having
that
weapon
and
having
lower
court
judges
who
are
disposed
to
leave
that
there,
everyone
knows
is
a
practical
matter
that
after
the
this
fellow
is
hauled
away
from
the
area
where
he’s
annoying
somebody
is
either
going
to
get
dismissed
in
the
police
court
the
following
morning
or
be
it
as
it
more
worried
about
a
full
trial,
he’s
going
to
get
dismissed
eventually
or
if
a
trial
court
judge
is
so
imbued
with
this
ultra
strictness
that
pervaded
our
community
at
the
time
these
decisions
were
coming
down,
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
reverse.
and
the
only
way
this
case
ever
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
were
to
our
intense
surprise,
it
was
held
constitutional
was
by
not
having
any
facts
that
they’re
not.
i’m
bothered
but
that’s
the
answer
i
must
give
you.
i
don’t
like
it,
but
that’s
the
way
it
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
the
state
court’s
opinion
by
the
majority,
the
four
--
four-judge
decision
complaints
i
would
say
rather
bitterly
your
honor
about
that.
the
dissenting
opinion
says
they
don’t
need
any
facts.
they
said
it’s
solely
a
constitutional
question
on
the
language
of
the
face
of
the
ordinance.
it’s
a
four
to
three
decision
there.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
hope
i
address
myself
to
your
question.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
embarrassed
to
say
i
don’t
know
what
it
says
in
there.
i’ve
read
it
for
several
weeks
and
i
just
don’t
know
your
honor.
the
only
facts
that
i’ve
attempted
to
present
is
that
the
appellant
coates
was
a
student
demonstrator
and
the
other
appellants
were
pickets
in
labor
dispute.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
there’s
a
reference
to
that
in
my
appendix.
the
judge
in
passing
sentence
referred
to
that
in
the
--
in
our
brown
appendix
your
honor,
but
it
doesn’t’
reach
a
conclusion.
he
says
well,
there
may
have
been
traffic
flow,
and
if
there
was
as
i
recall
his
statement,
there
may
have
been
traffic
flow
impeded
and
after
was,
they
should
have
charged
him
under
--
they
could
have
charged
him
under
that.
but
i
must
say,
i
cannot
answer
you
with
--
i
cannot
represent
that
i’m
completely
up
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
deliberately
sir,
deliberately.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
excuse
me
if
i
may.
there
was
a
very
important
to
me
at
least
to
answer
i
wanted
to
give.
i’m
here
on
the
same
assumption
of
the
minority
of
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’ve
been
trying
cases
for
so
long
that
i’ve
to
discipline
myself
not
to
speak
outside
the
record.
of
course,
i
know
what
happened
your
honor.
i
know
what
happened.
i
know
where
coates
is
marching
up
and
down
on
main
street
in
the
city
of
cincinnati
on
the
flag
with
a
bunch
of
student
demonstrators
and
they
were
dirty,
unkempt,
unshaven
any
college
demonstrators.
i
know
that,
and
i
know
the
rest
of
these
appellants.
i’ve
never
met
them,
but
i
made
inquiry.
obviously
and
i
know
that
they
were
at
a
labor
dispute.
i’m
quite
sure
was
the
general
electric
plant
in
one
of
the
suburbs
of
cincinnati,
and
the
employer,
the
–
management
got
mad
at
him
and
have
him
arrested
for
loitering.
i’m
sorry
to
misled
your
honor.
i’ve
difficulty
transposing
from
what’s
on
the
record
and
what’s
not
on
the
record.
none
of
which
is
on
the
record
and
we
didn’t
attempt
to
bring
up
on
the
record.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes,
yes.
and
of
course,
they
would
apply
to
only
four
of
the
five
too.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
the
government
has
more
clearly
defined
the
wrong
doing.
if
the
blocking
traffic
should
be
a
crime,
and
let’s
say,
it’s
a
crime;
let’s
pass
an
ordinance
prohibiting
a
blocking
of
traffic.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
sorry,
well
--
were
now
at
the
point
your
honor
believes
one
thing
and
not
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
alright.
i
don’t
--
i
just
don’t
agree
with
you.
i
think
annoyance
is
so
vague.
well,
i’ve
already
said
and
answer
your
previous
question.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
thought
you’re
approaching
on
the
more
broad
basis.
i
understood
you
to
say
anything,
let’s
agree
that
some
set
of
circumstances
is
annoyance
and
anybody
will
agree
to
that.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
because
who
knows
what
a
particular
policeman
or
particular
police
court
judge
is
going
to
decide
on
a
particular
morning
is
that
annoyance?
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
since
we’ve
already
--
you
and
i
have
already
stipulated
that
these
facts
are
so
atrocious
that
everybody
would
be
annoyed,
i
have
to
say
yes,
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right
and
i
think
i’ve
cited
precedents
for
that
--
from
this
court’s
opinion.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
both
of
those
are
clearly
defined.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
surely,
because
what
annoys
a
policeman
is
not
susceptible
to
same
definition
for
all
policemen.
but
what
is
speeding
in
traffic
is
35
miles
or
an
hour
or
38
miles
an
hour
and
that
is
susceptible
to
exact
definition
and
weaving,
i
submit
to
you
as
virtually
the
same,
accordingly
the
weaving
doesn’t
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
believe
so.
i
think
i’ve
to
answer
it
you
by
saying
we
have
to
look
to
our
courts
to
tell
us
--
there’s
going
to
be
a
dividing
line
somewhere
and
i
think
that’s
we’re
here
for.
it's
for
you
to
decide
whether
this
is
on
one
side
or
the
other,
the
dividing
line.
i
think
and
i’m
urging
that
annoyance
is
too
far,
too
far
from
the
center
or
too
far
from
a
clearly
definable
dividing
line
within
the
context
of
the
attempt
on
making
to
answer
your
question.
i
think
annoyance
is
just
to
vague
and
i’ve
attempt
to
do
--
cite
some
authorities
to
that
effect
and
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh!
i
think
there
would
be
a
broad
purpose
of
the
legislature
to
do
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
i’m
leaving
you
now
your
honor.
you
--
it’s
not
appropriate
for
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
very
strongly
in
favor
both
emotionally
and
--
in
this
case
with
the
principle
of
accommodation
in
balance.
i
do
not
think
that
this
test
is
annoyance
test
is
properly
within
a
goodwill
application
of
that
concept
for
want
of
a
more
thought
out
phrase.
i
don’t
think
a
legislature
can
or
the
court
should
approve
a
--
an
attempt
to
accommodate
that
is
--
that
leaves
that
much
up
to
guess
work.
who
would
know
in
advance
--
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
about
this
atrocious
event?
well,
let’s
get
--for
a
moment,
let’s
get
away
from
the
atrocious
of
event.
let’s
get
to
one
that’s
almost
atrocious.
well,
who
knows
in
advance
when
he’s
going
down
the
street,
whether
--
if
you’re
a
policeman,
whether
you’re
going
to
find
that
annoying
or
whereas
a
different
policeman
who
had
a
different
set
of
circumstances
when
he
left
home
that
morning
or
a
different
degree
of
comfort
--
comfort
would
be
equally
annoyed?
that’s
the
area
that
i
pursue
to
be
the
danger
here.
and
by
doing
that,
you
see,
that
leads
me
to
the
what
i
consider
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
points
here,
that
leads
me
into
what
i
conceive
to
be
this
contempt
that
this
thing
develops
and
promotes
contempt
for
the
law.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
would
certainly
consider
it
annoying
and
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
would
be
annoying.
i
think
they
should
be
charged
with
blocking
traffic.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
don’t
think
we
do.
but
there’s
one.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
correct
and
i
think
this
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
that
ordinance
is
so
broad
that
must
not
be
permitted
to
stand
and
that’s
the
argument
that
was
urged
by
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
believe,
i
can
refer
to
one
quickly
here.
i’m
afraid
i’m
going
to
have
to
search
longer
than
i
can
just
grab
it
out
of
here
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
hesitate
to
guess
your
honor
which
i
am
thank
you
for
the
citation
mr.
justice
stewart.
i’m
confident
that
what
i’m
saying
is
correct,
but
i
can’t
pull
the
names
to
this
citation.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
my
--
another
person,
another
attorney
in
my
office
handled
this
case
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
and
i’m
--
i
believe
that
he
has
felt
so
strongly
about
this
that
with
his
client’s
permission,
he
was
permitted
to
bring
this
thing
up
on
the
legal
question
only.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
the
cost
remitted
in
most
of
the
cases
and
one
of
them
had
a
relatively
small
fine
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
$30.00
i
believe.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
believe
so
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
my
understanding,
yes
that
it
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’ll
be
most
happy
for
you
to
have
had
it,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
i
never
expected
this
case
to
get
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
we
expected
an
intermediate
court
in
ohio
to
strike
this
down
as
all
other
intermediate
courts
had
done
on
the
similar
language
in
the
20
years
between
1940
and
1968.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
under
the
decision
of
this
court;
that
would
be
correct.
that
would
be
--
the
historical
development
of
the
point,
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
the
only
answer
that
suggests
itself
to
me
immediately
on
that
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
an
equal
burden
with
us
to
make
you
aware
of
that
if
that
was
the
case.
their
opinion
says
that
they
didn’t
have
any
facts.
so,
to
your
precise
question,
that’s
not
involved
here
because
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no
sir.
they
did
not
attempt
to.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
and
the
dissenting
opinion
of
course
did
say
they
didn’t
feel
that
is
the
--
just
three
dissenting
judges
didn’t
go
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
not
aware
of
it
sir,
no.
i’m
sure,
the
--
i
know
a
record
was
taken
and
we
could
get
--
i
know
the
shorthand
reporter.
we
could
get
her
original
notes
if
that
was
relevant.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
right.
it’s
in
our
appendix
here,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
any
of
the
courts.
that’s
why
the
difficulty
with
his
honor’s
question
over
here,
when
he
said
rather
of
sure,
i
know
what
the
facts
are,
but
they’re
not
properly
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
--
in
my
opinion
been
presented
to
any
court.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
don’t
think
that
situation
would
arise
your
honor
because
i
think
there
would
have
been
assault
and
battery
or
some
other
type
of
arrest.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
we
would
all
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
and
you’re
saying
that
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
can
only
answer
that.
i’d
be
delighted
to
have
this
court
have
a
full
record
that
the
method
in
which
this
case
grew
as
such
that
it
just
was
never
anticipated
and
it
was
deliberately
anticipated
the
other
way
as
i’ve
attempted
to
explain
earlier
because
up
until
this
case,
no
ohio
court
has
ever
upheld
a
conviction
under
this
language.
they’ve
either
found
it
unconstitutional
or
reserved
on
the
facts.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
$50.00-fine
and
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir,
and
then
remitted
all,
but
one
i
believe.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
all
but
one.
i
believe
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
and
called
annoyance.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
and
of
course,
the
other
side
of
that
is
the
pernicious
event
and
how
about
an
american
legion
convention
where
there’s
no
restrictions
at
all
and
the
people
who
are
the
day
before
arrested
for
annoyance
under
this
and
some
relatively
an
innocuous
sort
of
circumstances,
see
that
no
attempt
is
made
to
enforce
this
as
opposed
to
a
rowdy
convention
for
example
or
a
group
of
less
offensive
people,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
don’t
think
they
get
arrested
for
the
cincinnati
loitering
ordinance
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
indeed,
you
don’t.
no,
you
don’t.
and
surely,
you
couldn’t
--
i
surely,
none
of
us
would
then
attempt
to
say
that
this
ordinance
can
be
used
for
all
crimes
because
if
it
is,
then
we
can
throw
all
the
other
ordinances
out.
this
would
be
the
only
one
we
need
then.
we
could
do
away
with
the
murder
and
speeding
and
all
the
other
type
of
ordinances.
that’s
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
sorry
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right,
right.
but
i
think
just
to
reverse
this
true.
i
think
that
this
is
--
this
permits
sloppy,
ill-defined
--
sloppy
work
and
ill-defined
charges.
and
i
think
it
tends
to
deteriorate
the
system
because
people
gain
disrespect
for
a
system
which
is
so
subject
to
the
whims
of
a
particular
policeman
or
an
individual
judge.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
should
have
said
that
too
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
didn’t
choose
to
affirm
this
constitutionality
on
that
basis.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh
--
in
the
ordinary
course
clearly.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
sir?
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
all
these
people.
this
is
a
straight
appeal
all
the
way.
there’s
been
the
reversal
any
way
on
--
anywhere
on
this
thing.
the
appeal
was
to
the
state
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
not
this
court.
a
local
court
of
appeals
in
ohio
to
follow
what
at
that
time
was
a
long
line
of
ohio
decisions
that
it
was
void
for
vagueness
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
would
not
want
to
dispute
that,
even
though
there’s
a
little
bit
of
factual
situation
in
my
filing
--
my
papers
filed
here.
i
think
a
direct
approach
to
your
question
is
yes,
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes,
and
this
narrowing
definition
that
which
several
of
your
honors
have
referred
to
is
--
occurs
frequently
through
decisions
of
this
court,
but
are
also
some
cases
where
they’re
just
so
broad.
i
took
a
chance
when
i
took
a
direct
appeal
rather
a
motion.
i
guess
my
partner
took
a
chance
when
he
came
up
on
the
thing.
i
believe
and
i
believe
emphatically
that
annoyance
is
too
broad
by
any
definition
of
annoyance,
and
i
have
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
as
i
understand
the
case,
i
have
to
assert
that
i
am
talking
both
of
them
your
honor,
but
i’m
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
it’s
clear
that
i’m
emphasizing
vagueness.
now,
there’s
no
question
about
that,
yes
sir.
i
think
a
man
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
him
in
advance
when
his
conduct
is
going
to
be
a
crime
and
you
can’t
tell
it
when
annoyance
is
the
test.
that’s
the
real
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
but
some
isn’t
enough.
it’s
going
to
be
all
in
a
criminal
case
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh,
he’s
going
to
be
judged
--
he’s
going
to
be
judged
by
it,
the
police
court
judge
the
following
morning
on
this
very
ill-defined
or
loose
standard.
so
i’ve
to
say
that’s
not
enough.
at
least,
my
argument
for
what
is
worth
is
that
it’s
any
annoyance
is
too
broad.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
all
we’re
asking
you
to
do.
i
think
candor
compels
us,
we’re
asking
you
to
rule
on
the
face
--
the
ordinance
on
the
face
of
it
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
concerns
a
cincinnati
ordinance
which
is
called
the
loitering
ordinance,
but
which
is
really
more
an
unlawful
assembly
type
piece
of
legislation.
the
ordinance
provides
that
when
in
the
company
of
two
or
more
other
people,
one
so
conducts
himself
as
to
annoy
persons
passing
by,
a
crime
is
committed,
unless
that
conduct
takes
place
at
the
public
meeting
of
citizens,
in
which
case,
it
is
not
crime.
hamilton
county,
ohio
includes
cincinnati
and
the
number
of
other
municipalities
and
several
of
them
have
also
had
ordinances
using
similar
language.
in
the
1940,
the
common
police
court
for
hamilton
county
which
has
county
wide
jurisdiction
held
that
the
language
used
made
the
legislation
unconstitutional.
all
over
ohio,
the
courts
reached
the
same
conclusion
through
the
years
and
in
1968,
the
appeals
court
for
the
cleveland
area
wrote
in
detail
at
length
and
with
emphasis
how
the
lack
of
ascertainable
standards
made
the
annoyance
test
in
the
cleveland
ordinance
cause
it
to
represent
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power,
and
it
was
therefore
void
for
vagueness.
that
opinion
is
quoted
at
length
at
pages
5
and
6
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
was
written
by
the
same
judge
who
in
1970,
he
wrote
so
strongly
to
the
opposite
effect
in
a
4
to
3
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
this
case
of
coates
versus
cincinnati.
but
at
least
between
1940
and
1968,
the
annoyance
test
was
considered
to
be
void
for
vagueness.
indeed
in
1962,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
held
that
a
dog
barking
ordinance
which
used
the
annoyance
test
was
void
for
vagueness.
but
in
1967
during
the
summer,
cincinnati
along
with
many
other
areas
had
racial
disturbances,
and
the
police
and
perhaps
more
significantly,
other
city
officials
frequently
found
themselves
irritated
or
provoked,
annoyed
by
the
conduct
of
those
who
complained
and
those
who
disturbed.
and
members
of
the
city
government
including
police
were
not
able
to
charge
many
of
those
who
irritated
them
with
trespass
or
assault
and
battery
or
profanity
or
disorderly
conduct.
so
the
officials
and
the
police
who
were
beset
by
annoyance
which
webster’s
collegiate
dictionary
in
the
7th
edition
defines
as
a
wearing
on
the
nerves
by
persistent
petty
unpleasantness,
they
arrested
those
who
provoke
them
and
hold
them
away
and
that
ended
the
annoyance
for
a
very
short
time,
because
that
use
of
that
legislative
language
making
annoyance
a
crime,
directly
results
in
contempt
for
our
system
of
law
and
order,
or
i
think
more
properly
law
and
order
with
the
justice.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
there
was
a
trial.
actually,
there
are
two
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
at
the
trial,
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
there
was
evidence
of
the
type
your
honor,
means
refers
to
presented.
the
case
did
not
come
up
on
the
facts.
the
only
--
i
believe
mr.
nichols
can
correct
me,
i
believe
the
facts
--
i
have
to
correct
myself
--
i
believe
the
facts
were
presented
to
the
trial
court
to
some
degree
but
no
effort
was
made
to
incorporate
them
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
and
they
have
not
going
to
part
of
the
appeal.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
that’s
why
i
had
to
correct
myself
when
i
was
addressing
myself
to
what
we
have
here
and
we
have
not
come
up
on
any
facts,
if
your
honor
please.
other
then
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes,
yes,
i
certainly
do.
but
i
maintain
this
statute
is
so
broad
and
i’ve
attempted
to
cite
the
cases
that
illustrate
that
the
cases
--
decisions
of
this
court.
i
maintain
that
that
annoyance
is
so
broad
that
even
though
there
maybe
factual
circumstances
which
could
properly
be
used
for
a
valid
conviction,
we
can’t
take
a
chance
on
that.
it’s
too
dangerous
to
allow
this
annoyance
thing
and
the
inconvenient
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
then
they
should
have
been
charged
with
it,
whether
be
obscene
discourse
or
disorderly
conduct
or
assault
and
battery
or
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
have
to
disagree,
your
honor.
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
can
just
find
what
annoyance
is.
i’m
sure
you
and
i
would
have
difference
standards
of
annoyance.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
we
have
to
apply
a
certain
degree
of
reason
there.
i’m
sure
that
you
and
i
or
anyone
in
this
room
could
designate
certain
conduct
as
annoying.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
then,
they
should
have
been
--
that
conduct
would
then
have
also
been
as
i
understand
the
basic
idea
of
criminal
law
only
those
acts
which
in
legislation
are
crimes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
say
that
that
does
not
of
itself
granting
which
your
honor
says
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
--
granting
what
your
honor
says.
i
say
it
is
too
dangerous
to
allow
that
broad
general
characterization
of
conduct
to
be
a
tool
in
the
hands
if
you
will
of
lazy
policemen,
who
were
still
on
the
level
of
official.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
i’ve
to
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
i
have
to
agree
completely
with
what
you
just
said,
yes
sir.
and
in
that
connection,
there
are
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
over
the
years
which
go
in
two
different
areas.
one
is
the
area
that
you
have
just
alluded
to,
and
the
other
is
the
area
where
there
is
a
permissible
interpretation,
and
that
those
cases
are
far
more
sophisticated
than
the
argument
i’m
attempting
to
present
here.
i’m
trying
to
state
the
single
issue
you
phrased.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
find
that
a
very
difficult
question
which
i’ve
been
anticipating
for
some
months.
it’s
easy
for
me
to
say
your
honor
that
i
didn’t
get
the
hold
of
this
case
until
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
decided,
but
candor
compels
me
to
indicate
that
i’ve
a
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
ordinance,
not
statute,
these
are
ordinance,
if
this
ordinance
was
ever
to
get
an
authoritative
interpretation,
it
had
to
come
up
on
the
law
alone
and
not
on
the
facts
because
for
years,
the
local
officials
have
been
running
people
and
holding
them
and
turning
them
lose
and
the
local
--
the
lower
courts
have
been
finding
them
not
guilty
on
the
facts.
the
perfect
example
is
the
lathan
johnson
case
which
is
in
appendix
to
my
brief
here.
it’s
a
very
short
opinion
and
that’s
the
one
who
started
all
this.
it
arose
out
of
the
1967
racial
disturbances,
and
i
tried
that
case
and
the
state
court
of
appeals
said
when
they
reversed,
they
said,
this
is
probably
unconstitutional
this
ordinance
but
we
don’t
have
to
decide
that
and
you
see
by
doing
that,
they
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
we
have
the
facts
there
and
they
said
there
weren't
any
facts
to
support
the
conviction.
i
tried
that
case
--
it
came
up
on
full
bill
of
exceptions.
but
you
see,
that’s
the
pernicious
part
of
this
thing
by
having
that
weapon
and
having
lower
court
judges
who
are
disposed
to
leave
that
there,
everyone
knows
is
a
practical
matter
that
after
the
this
fellow
is
hauled
away
from
the
area
where
he’s
annoying
somebody
is
either
going
to
get
dismissed
in
the
police
court
the
following
morning
or
be
it
as
it
more
worried
about
a
full
trial,
he’s
going
to
get
dismissed
eventually
or
if
a
trial
court
judge
is
so
imbued
with
this
ultra
strictness
that
pervaded
our
community
at
the
time
these
decisions
were
coming
down,
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
reverse.
and
the
only
way
this
case
ever
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
were
to
our
intense
surprise,
it
was
held
constitutional
was
by
not
having
any
facts
that
they’re
not.
i’m
bothered
but
that’s
the
answer
i
must
give
you.
i
don’t
like
it,
but
that’s
the
way
it
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
the
state
court’s
opinion
by
the
majority,
the
four
--
four-judge
decision
complaints
i
would
say
rather
bitterly
your
honor
about
that.
the
dissenting
opinion
says
they
don’t
need
any
facts.
they
said
it’s
solely
a
constitutional
question
on
the
language
of
the
face
of
the
ordinance.
it’s
a
four
to
three
decision
there.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
hope
i
address
myself
to
your
question.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
embarrassed
to
say
i
don’t
know
what
it
says
in
there.
i’ve
read
it
for
several
weeks
and
i
just
don’t
know
your
honor.
the
only
facts
that
i’ve
attempted
to
present
is
that
the
appellant
coates
was
a
student
demonstrator
and
the
other
appellants
were
pickets
in
labor
dispute.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
there’s
a
reference
to
that
in
my
appendix.
the
judge
in
passing
sentence
referred
to
that
in
the
--
in
our
brown
appendix
your
honor,
but
it
doesn’t’
reach
a
conclusion.
he
says
well,
there
may
have
been
traffic
flow,
and
if
there
was
as
i
recall
his
statement,
there
may
have
been
traffic
flow
impeded
and
after
was,
they
should
have
charged
him
under
--
they
could
have
charged
him
under
that.
but
i
must
say,
i
cannot
answer
you
with
--
i
cannot
represent
that
i’m
completely
up
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
deliberately
sir,
deliberately.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
excuse
me
if
i
may.
there
was
a
very
important
to
me
at
least
to
answer
i
wanted
to
give.
i’m
here
on
the
same
assumption
of
the
minority
of
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’ve
been
trying
cases
for
so
long
that
i’ve
to
discipline
myself
not
to
speak
outside
the
record.
of
course,
i
know
what
happened
your
honor.
i
know
what
happened.
i
know
where
coates
is
marching
up
and
down
on
main
street
in
the
city
of
cincinnati
on
the
flag
with
a
bunch
of
student
demonstrators
and
they
were
dirty,
unkempt,
unshaven
any
college
demonstrators.
i
know
that,
and
i
know
the
rest
of
these
appellants.
i’ve
never
met
them,
but
i
made
inquiry.
obviously
and
i
know
that
they
were
at
a
labor
dispute.
i’m
quite
sure
was
the
general
electric
plant
in
one
of
the
suburbs
of
cincinnati,
and
the
employer,
the
–
management
got
mad
at
him
and
have
him
arrested
for
loitering.
i’m
sorry
to
misled
your
honor.
i’ve
difficulty
transposing
from
what’s
on
the
record
and
what’s
not
on
the
record.
none
of
which
is
on
the
record
and
we
didn’t
attempt
to
bring
up
on
the
record.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes,
yes.
and
of
course,
they
would
apply
to
only
four
of
the
five
too.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
the
government
has
more
clearly
defined
the
wrong
doing.
if
the
blocking
traffic
should
be
a
crime,
and
let’s
say,
it’s
a
crime;
let’s
pass
an
ordinance
prohibiting
a
blocking
of
traffic.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
sorry,
well
--
were
now
at
the
point
your
honor
believes
one
thing
and
not
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
alright.
i
don’t
--
i
just
don’t
agree
with
you.
i
think
annoyance
is
so
vague.
well,
i’ve
already
said
and
answer
your
previous
question.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
thought
you’re
approaching
on
the
more
broad
basis.
i
understood
you
to
say
anything,
let’s
agree
that
some
set
of
circumstances
is
annoyance
and
anybody
will
agree
to
that.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
because
who
knows
what
a
particular
policeman
or
particular
police
court
judge
is
going
to
decide
on
a
particular
morning
is
that
annoyance?
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
since
we’ve
already
--
you
and
i
have
already
stipulated
that
these
facts
are
so
atrocious
that
everybody
would
be
annoyed,
i
have
to
say
yes,
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right
and
i
think
i’ve
cited
precedents
for
that
--
from
this
court’s
opinion.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
both
of
those
are
clearly
defined.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
surely,
because
what
annoys
a
policeman
is
not
susceptible
to
same
definition
for
all
policemen.
but
what
is
speeding
in
traffic
is
35
miles
or
an
hour
or
38
miles
an
hour
and
that
is
susceptible
to
exact
definition
and
weaving,
i
submit
to
you
as
virtually
the
same,
accordingly
the
weaving
doesn’t
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
believe
so.
i
think
i’ve
to
answer
it
you
by
saying
we
have
to
look
to
our
courts
to
tell
us
--
there’s
going
to
be
a
dividing
line
somewhere
and
i
think
that’s
we’re
here
for.
it's
for
you
to
decide
whether
this
is
on
one
side
or
the
other,
the
dividing
line.
i
think
and
i’m
urging
that
annoyance
is
too
far,
too
far
from
the
center
or
too
far
from
a
clearly
definable
dividing
line
within
the
context
of
the
attempt
on
making
to
answer
your
question.
i
think
annoyance
is
just
to
vague
and
i’ve
attempt
to
do
--
cite
some
authorities
to
that
effect
and
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh!
i
think
there
would
be
a
broad
purpose
of
the
legislature
to
do
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
i’m
leaving
you
now
your
honor.
you
--
it’s
not
appropriate
for
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
very
strongly
in
favor
both
emotionally
and
--
in
this
case
with
the
principle
of
accommodation
in
balance.
i
do
not
think
that
this
test
is
annoyance
test
is
properly
within
a
goodwill
application
of
that
concept
for
want
of
a
more
thought
out
phrase.
i
don’t
think
a
legislature
can
or
the
court
should
approve
a
--
an
attempt
to
accommodate
that
is
--
that
leaves
that
much
up
to
guess
work.
who
would
know
in
advance
--
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
about
this
atrocious
event?
well,
let’s
get
--for
a
moment,
let’s
get
away
from
the
atrocious
of
event.
let’s
get
to
one
that’s
almost
atrocious.
well,
who
knows
in
advance
when
he’s
going
down
the
street,
whether
--
if
you’re
a
policeman,
whether
you’re
going
to
find
that
annoying
or
whereas
a
different
policeman
who
had
a
different
set
of
circumstances
when
he
left
home
that
morning
or
a
different
degree
of
comfort
--
comfort
would
be
equally
annoyed?
that’s
the
area
that
i
pursue
to
be
the
danger
here.
and
by
doing
that,
you
see,
that
leads
me
to
the
what
i
consider
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
points
here,
that
leads
me
into
what
i
conceive
to
be
this
contempt
that
this
thing
develops
and
promotes
contempt
for
the
law.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
would
certainly
consider
it
annoying
and
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
would
be
annoying.
i
think
they
should
be
charged
with
blocking
traffic.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
don’t
think
we
do.
but
there’s
one.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
correct
and
i
think
this
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
that
ordinance
is
so
broad
that
must
not
be
permitted
to
stand
and
that’s
the
argument
that
was
urged
by
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
believe,
i
can
refer
to
one
quickly
here.
i’m
afraid
i’m
going
to
have
to
search
longer
than
i
can
just
grab
it
out
of
here
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
hesitate
to
guess
your
honor
which
i
am
thank
you
for
the
citation
mr.
justice
stewart.
i’m
confident
that
what
i’m
saying
is
correct,
but
i
can’t
pull
the
names
to
this
citation.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
my
--
another
person,
another
attorney
in
my
office
handled
this
case
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
and
i’m
--
i
believe
that
he
has
felt
so
strongly
about
this
that
with
his
client’s
permission,
he
was
permitted
to
bring
this
thing
up
on
the
legal
question
only.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
the
cost
remitted
in
most
of
the
cases
and
one
of
them
had
a
relatively
small
fine
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
$30.00
i
believe.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
believe
so
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
my
understanding,
yes
that
it
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’ll
be
most
happy
for
you
to
have
had
it,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
i
never
expected
this
case
to
get
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
we
expected
an
intermediate
court
in
ohio
to
strike
this
down
as
all
other
intermediate
courts
had
done
on
the
similar
language
in
the
20
years
between
1940
and
1968.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
under
the
decision
of
this
court;
that
would
be
correct.
that
would
be
--
the
historical
development
of
the
point,
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
the
only
answer
that
suggests
itself
to
me
immediately
on
that
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
an
equal
burden
with
us
to
make
you
aware
of
that
if
that
was
the
case.
their
opinion
says
that
they
didn’t
have
any
facts.
so,
to
your
precise
question,
that’s
not
involved
here
because
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no
sir.
they
did
not
attempt
to.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
and
the
dissenting
opinion
of
course
did
say
they
didn’t
feel
that
is
the
--
just
three
dissenting
judges
didn’t
go
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
not
aware
of
it
sir,
no.
i’m
sure,
the
--
i
know
a
record
was
taken
and
we
could
get
--
i
know
the
shorthand
reporter.
we
could
get
her
original
notes
if
that
was
relevant.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
right.
it’s
in
our
appendix
here,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
any
of
the
courts.
that’s
why
the
difficulty
with
his
honor’s
question
over
here,
when
he
said
rather
of
sure,
i
know
what
the
facts
are,
but
they’re
not
properly
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
--
in
my
opinion
been
presented
to
any
court.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
don’t
think
that
situation
would
arise
your
honor
because
i
think
there
would
have
been
assault
and
battery
or
some
other
type
of
arrest.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
think
we
would
all
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
and
you’re
saying
that
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
can
only
answer
that.
i’d
be
delighted
to
have
this
court
have
a
full
record
that
the
method
in
which
this
case
grew
as
such
that
it
just
was
never
anticipated
and
it
was
deliberately
anticipated
the
other
way
as
i’ve
attempted
to
explain
earlier
because
up
until
this
case,
no
ohio
court
has
ever
upheld
a
conviction
under
this
language.
they’ve
either
found
it
unconstitutional
or
reserved
on
the
facts.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
$50.00-fine
and
the
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir,
and
then
remitted
all,
but
one
i
believe.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
all
but
one.
i
believe
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
and
called
annoyance.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes
sir.
and
of
course,
the
other
side
of
that
is
the
pernicious
event
and
how
about
an
american
legion
convention
where
there’s
no
restrictions
at
all
and
the
people
who
are
the
day
before
arrested
for
annoyance
under
this
and
some
relatively
an
innocuous
sort
of
circumstances,
see
that
no
attempt
is
made
to
enforce
this
as
opposed
to
a
rowdy
convention
for
example
or
a
group
of
less
offensive
people,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
well,
i
don’t
think
they
get
arrested
for
the
cincinnati
loitering
ordinance
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
no.
indeed,
you
don’t.
no,
you
don’t.
and
surely,
you
couldn’t
--
i
surely,
none
of
us
would
then
attempt
to
say
that
this
ordinance
can
be
used
for
all
crimes
because
if
it
is,
then
we
can
throw
all
the
other
ordinances
out.
this
would
be
the
only
one
we
need
then.
we
could
do
away
with
the
murder
and
speeding
and
all
the
other
type
of
ordinances.
that’s
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i’m
sorry
sir.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
right,
right.
but
i
think
just
to
reverse
this
true.
i
think
that
this
is
--
this
permits
sloppy,
ill-defined
--
sloppy
work
and
ill-defined
charges.
and
i
think
it
tends
to
deteriorate
the
system
because
people
gain
disrespect
for
a
system
which
is
so
subject
to
the
whims
of
a
particular
policeman
or
an
individual
judge.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
should
have
said
that
too
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
didn’t
choose
to
affirm
this
constitutionality
on
that
basis.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh
--
in
the
ordinary
course
clearly.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
sir?
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
all
these
people.
this
is
a
straight
appeal
all
the
way.
there’s
been
the
reversal
any
way
on
--
anywhere
on
this
thing.
the
appeal
was
to
the
state
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
not
this
court.
a
local
court
of
appeals
in
ohio
to
follow
what
at
that
time
was
a
long
line
of
ohio
decisions
that
it
was
void
for
vagueness
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
i
would
not
want
to
dispute
that,
even
though
there’s
a
little
bit
of
factual
situation
in
my
filing
--
my
papers
filed
here.
i
think
a
direct
approach
to
your
question
is
yes,
right.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
yes,
and
this
narrowing
definition
that
which
several
of
your
honors
have
referred
to
is
--
occurs
frequently
through
decisions
of
this
court,
but
are
also
some
cases
where
they’re
just
so
broad.
i
took
a
chance
when
i
took
a
direct
appeal
rather
a
motion.
i
guess
my
partner
took
a
chance
when
he
came
up
on
the
thing.
i
believe
and
i
believe
emphatically
that
annoyance
is
too
broad
by
any
definition
of
annoyance,
and
i
have
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
as
i
understand
the
case,
i
have
to
assert
that
i
am
talking
both
of
them
your
honor,
but
i’m
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
it’s
clear
that
i’m
emphasizing
vagueness.
now,
there’s
no
question
about
that,
yes
sir.
i
think
a
man
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
him
in
advance
when
his
conduct
is
going
to
be
a
crime
and
you
can’t
tell
it
when
annoyance
is
the
test.
that’s
the
real
--
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
but
some
isn’t
enough.
it’s
going
to
be
all
in
a
criminal
case
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
oh,
he’s
going
to
be
judged
--
he’s
going
to
be
judged
by
it,
the
police
court
judge
the
following
morning
on
this
very
ill-defined
or
loose
standard.
so
i’ve
to
say
that’s
not
enough.
at
least,
my
argument
for
what
is
worth
is
that
it’s
any
annoyance
is
too
broad.
mr.
robert
r.
lavercombe
that’s
all
we’re
asking
you
to
do.
i
think
candor
compels
us,
we’re
asking
you
to
rule
on
the
face
--
the
ordinance
on
the
face
of
it
your
honor.
thank
you.
