justice

suppose
some
people
deliberately
blocked
traffic,
would
there
be
any
doubt
that
they
deliberately
were
doing
an
act
that
was
annoying
to
the
people
in
those
cars?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
you
don’t
--
do
you
have
a
blocking
traffic?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
there
some
facts
here,
all
we
have
is
an
ordinance,
we
don’t
have
anything
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
case
in
this
court
where
all
we
had
is
the
ordinance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
case
was
it
that
all
this
court
had
was
the
ordinance
and
no
record
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
disorderly
conduct
ordinance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
difference
between
that
ordinance
and
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
different
from
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn’t
three
people
simultaneously
on
the
same
corner
be
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
vow,
what’s
the
difference
between
the
statutes?
and
the
reason
i’m
saying
this
because
this
looks
to
me
like
a
catch
all
for
whatever
might
be
missed,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
less
than
disorderly
conduct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
situation
where
three
people
on
the
same
corner
could
violate
both
ordinances
at
the
same
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
you
prosecute
them
for
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
three
people
are
standing
outside
of
the
house
of
some
colleges
to
just
despise
the
smoking
and
they’re
smoking
cigarettes,
that
would
be
annoying,
wouldn’t
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
you
say
wouldn’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think,
i
would
be
annoying,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
doesn't
say
the
statute
said
annoying
to
the
people
in
the
house?
justice
thurgood
marshall
annoying
to
person’s
passing
by
or
occupants
of
adjacent
building.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
the
statute
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
you’re
smoking
cigarettes
outside
of
somebody’s
house
as
opposed
to
smoking
cigarettes
and
it
was
against
smog
and
everything,
it
would
be
annoying,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don’t
restrict
your
answer
to
harvard,
but
take
any
school
and
tell
me
what
annoying
means?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
school,
take
anyone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
i
as
a
citizen
know
the
limits
of
annoying.
this
is
annoying
and
this
is
not.
how
many
people
you
have
in
cincinnati?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
a
half
a
million
people,
because
this
is
to
the
people
in
their
individual
house.
now,
if
i’m
standing
on
the
corner
here
and
i
don’t
know
who
lives
in
that
house,
how
could
i
possibly
know
what
would
annoy
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
there
are
some
things
that
we
all
agree
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
mean
that
respectfully?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
nichols,
how
loud
would
i
have
to
be
talking
on
your
corner
with
two
others
of
us
before
i
would
annoy
you,
under
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
mine
is
on
your
pavement,
if
front
of
your
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
wasn’t
that
decibel
level
be
different
right
across
the
street?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
a
neighborhood
of
people,
all
middle
class
people
living
side
by
side.
some
people
are
deaf
that
they
could
turn
their
hearing
aid
off,
and
the
others
are
so
sensible
that
any
sound
will
awaken
them.
wouldn’t
each
one
of
them
have
a
different
level
of
annoyance
under
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
i’m
sitting
as
a
trial
judge
in
cincinnati,
how
would
i
decide
whether
it
was
too
loud
or
not
loud
enough?
justice
thurgood

there
isn’t
really

stick;
you
have

there
is
no

justice
thurgood

but
once
you
agree
that
there’s
not

as
to
how
loud
in

to
be
annoyance,
aren’t
you
getting
in

that’s
my
