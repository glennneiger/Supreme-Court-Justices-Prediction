justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
case
like
cramp,
cramp
against
the
board
of
public
instruction
in
florida,
what
we
had
was
the
language
of
the
state
statute.
that
involved
a
so
called
loyalty
oath
which
people
refused
to
take
and
all
we
had
there
was
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
the
case
that
comes
to
mind
in
a
quite
a
different
area,
the
first
amendment
area,
is
times
film
against
chicago
where
deliberately
again,
counsel
very
deliberately
kept
all
the
facts
away
from
the
courts
all
the
way
through
up
to
and
including
this
court
and
we
just
had
the
language
in
the
statute
that
involved
prior
restraint
of
the
motion
picture
film.
so,
there
have
been
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
except
mr.
lavercombe
under
ohio
practice
unless
it's
change,
you
have
made
up
as
your
bill
of
exceptions
only
that
part
of
the
record
that
you
wanted
the
reviewing
courts
to
consider?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
all
that
the
courts
passed
--
that’s
the
only
record
that’s
been
before
any
of
the
reviewing
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
$50.00.
justice
potter
stewart
judge
luber
fined
at
least
one
of
them
$50.00.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
in
eccentric
prosecutor
if
he
chose
could
let
say
three
or
four
people
who
stood
on
a
street
corner
and
proceeded
to
commit
first
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
he
could
have
proceeded
under
the
statute,
couldn’t
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
called
annoying?
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
we
don’t
know
in
this
case
really,
i
mean,
just
as
a
matter
absurd
theory
perhaps
that
these
people
didn’t
commit
the
equivalent
of
first
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
this
requires
a
group
doesn’t
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
that
citation,
346
f.2d
212?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
the
other
one,
it
isn’t
cited
in
your
brief
either?
justice
potter
stewart
harvey
--
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
was
he
a
member
of
the
three-judge-court?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
three-judge-court.
justice
potter
stewart
three
or
more
--
justice
potter
stewart
three
or
more
--
justice
potter
stewart
before
there
can
be
any
offense
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
you
read
the
words
of
the
statute
that
if
a
person
who
would
pass
by
or
a
person
who
is
an
occupant
of
an
adjacent
building
--
simply
testified
that
these
three
defendants
assembled
on
a
sidewalk
or
a
street
corner
or
vacant
lot
or
mouth
of
an
alley,
adjacent
to
the
building
where
i
live
or
in
a
vicinity
where
i
pass
by,
and
annoyed
me,
the
defendants
would
be
guilty
wouldn’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn’t’
be
up
to
the
court
to
consider
decibel
level
or
anything
else
by
only
that
the
sworn
statement
of
this
passerby
or
an
occupant
of
an
adjacent
building
that
he
was
annoyed,
that
would
be
enough
to
lead
for
a
conviction,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
ordinance
says.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
talking
about
the
three
people,
they
have
to
give
it.
justice
potter
stewart
or
in
order
to
be
a
violation,
they
have
to
be
three
people?
justice
potter
stewart
three
defendants,
and
then
the
passerby
says
those
defendants
were
standing
on
the
street
corner
and
i
passed
by
and
they
annoyed
me.
now,
that’s
the
end
of
case,
$50.00
fine.
isn’t
it
under
the
way
of
the
statute
is
written?
justice
potter
stewart
absolutely.
that’s
the
way
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
wording
of
the
statute
read,
aren’t
they?
