chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
117,
coates
against
the
city
of
cincinnati.
mr.
lavercombe,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
different,
what
is
different
about
the
situation
you
just
alluded
to
that
is
what
some
policeman
evaluates
at
a
particular
time
in
this
context
and
the
policeman
who
stops
a
person
for
speeding
and
it’s
his
opinion
version
of
the
speed
against
the
drivers,
or
he
arrests
him
for
weaving
in
traffic
and
changing
lanes,
is
there
anything
really
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
clearly
defined,
but
is
there
any
difference
--
any
difference
on
this
key
thing
that
you
emphasize,
namely
that
it
comes
down
to
what
annoys
a
policeman
and
why
is
that
any
different
from
what
the
policeman
thinks
is
weaving
in
traffic
or
speeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
definition
is
quite
is
true,
the
definition,
but
i’m
talking
about
the
evaluation
process
that
leads
the
policeman
to
making
the
arrest
and
almost
invariably
then
in
turn
leads
to
a
conviction
because
there
are
only
two
witnesses,
the
driver
and
the
policeman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
doesn’t
all
this
in
any
area
come
down
to
a
very
large
amount
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
arresting
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
or
not
that
in
shaping
ordinances
of
this
kind,
in
this
general
area
of
behavior
which
can’t
be
precisely
defined,
that
the
public
authority,
the
legislative
body
is
trying
to
make
an
accommodation
between
having
conduct
which
is
identified
as
subject
to
a
penalty
in
order
to
prevent
any
victims
in
this
case,
the
person’s
annoyed
or
upset
or
aggravated
from
taking
the
line
with
their
own
hands
and
engaging
in
a
street
riot
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it’s
better
if
--
it’s
better
for
public
authority
to
make
that
decision
and
let
--
let
us
say
for
example,
a
group
of
working
men
on
the
one
hand
or
students
on
the
other
annoy
and
aggravate
each
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don’t
agree
with
the
basic
principle
that
this
is
a
matter
of
accommodation
in
balance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
some
times
american
legionnaires
do
get
arrested
on
these
circumstances
too,
don’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
you
for
you’ve
told
us
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
your
side
of
this
case
whether
you
or
not
deliberately
made
the
choice
to
abandon
the
facts
and
gamble
on
getting
the
holding
of
this
court
that
this
statute
is
void
on
its
face
for
vagueness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
made
that
decision
at
the
outset,
you
committed
yourself
for
the
whole
course
of
the
litigation
and
when
it
came
here,
it
came
here
on
no
facts
at
all,
that’s
correct,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
nichols?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
took
you
perhaps
to
be
responding
that
you
could
charge
them
under
either?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
both?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ordinarily,
the
responsibility
for
the
record
--
stated
the
record
when
it
gets
to
an
appellant
court
is
the
responsibility
of
the
person
who
brings
this
case
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
question
on
this
matter
of
vagueness.
i
suppose
as
long
as
you
got
the
half
a
million
people
down
cincinnati,
you
must
have
an
ordinance
about
changing
lanes
in
traffics
so
as
to
endanger
the
flow
of
traffic,
that’s
the
way
to
put
some
times
or
changing
lanes
so
as
to
create
conditions
for
an
accident.
do
you
think
that
informs
the
drivers
anymore
than
or
any
less
than
this
ordinance
informs
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
only
issue
presented
here
isn’t
it
in
this
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
many
cities
do
have
ordinances
which
make
it
criminal
act
to
smoke
in
restaurant
or
an
elevator
or
a
store
or
a
public
building,
but
that
saying
that
direct
act,
it
isn’t
cast
in
terms
of
annoying,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ve
had
one
in
my
home
city
of
st.
paul
for
25
years,
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
definite
statute
and
is
quite
widely
accepted
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
takes
us
right
back
to
the
fact
situation.
this
must
--
this
kind
of
situation
first
goes
to
a
policeman,
he
must
make
a
value
of
judgment
that
he
will
make
an
arrest,
then
goes
to
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
and
he
make
a
value
of
judgment
and
we
can’t
make
any
value
of
judgment
about
this
--
of
that
character
without
any
facts.
all
we
can
do
is
pass
on
the
statute
on
its
face,
isn’t
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
