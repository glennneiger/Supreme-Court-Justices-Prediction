mr.
a.
david
nichols
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
failure
of
the
appellant
here
to
present
facts
has
been
a
problem
for
us
as
well
in
this
matter,
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court
very
briefly,
the
broad
statement
that
mr.
lavercombe
made
with
regard
to
the
activity
involved,
is
correct.
what
happened
was
on
december
7,
1967
with
regard
to
the
defendant
coates,
he
and
several
confederates
gathered
outside
the
united
states
federal
building
in
downtown,
cincinnati,
which
is
directly
across
main
street
from
the
post
office
and
courthouse.
and
there
coates
and
his
confederates
where
demonstrating
against
the
vietnamese
war
and
the
selective
service
system.
their
demonstration
went
so
far
as
to
block
the
doors
to
the
federal
building
so
that
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
to
assist
the
court
with
regard
to
this
matter
because
there
was
--
there
were
several
questions
with
regards
to
the
facts.
if
your
honors
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
this
is
what
--
as
i
indicated
your
honor,
this
is
one
of
the
problems
that
we
as
appellees
have
had
with
regard
to
this
case.
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
which
is
the
complaint
that
brings
this
case
to
this
court,
we
don’t
think
that
section
901-l6
of
the
cincinnati
code
of
ordinances
is
vague
nor
is
it
overbroad.
speaking
to
that
point
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
the
language
is
different
in
that
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
of
the
city
of
cincinnati
provides
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
an
individual
to
conduct
himself
in
a
noisy,
rude,
boisterous
or
insulting
matter
within
the
city
of
cincinnati.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
different
in
the
sense
that
it’s
--
that
is
one
individual
different
in
the
language
that
it’s
used.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
this
requires
--
this
might
be
classified,
if
it
please
your
honors
as
perhaps
a
group
disorderly
conduct
ordinance.
but
i
think,
we
have
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
oh,
i
think
they
could
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
its
conduct
which
is
troubling,
annoying,
vexatious
conduct
that
blocks
the
street,
stops
commerce,
stops
pedestrians.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
both
ordinances
at
the
same
time?
i
think,
there
are
those
situations
probably
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
would
suggest
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
would
not
happen.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
we
probably
could
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
pardon
me?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
if
they
tried
of
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i
don’t
think
we
could
do
that
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
we
stack
up
the
charges
one
after
the
other
and
shotgun
the
case.
i
don’t
think
that’s
all
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
either;
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
don’t
think
so
or
i
don’t
think
we
could
try,
that
we
can
set
a
defender
up
and
shoot
him
down
like
that
if
you
will
with
the
variety
of
charges,
such
as
we
often
times
find
in
the
traffic
area
where
over
zealous
police
officers
quite
candidly,
set
somebody
up
with
driving
one
of
the
influence
of
alcohol,
reckless
operation
and
a
myriad
of
other
things.
this
is
totally
wrong.
i
don’t
think
in
this
case
that
we
could
charge,
nor
could
we
try
individuals
engaged
in
that
conduct
for
both
disorderly
conduct
and
loitering.
if
i
may
respond
just
a
bit
further
with
regard
to
this
ordinance.
this
ordinance
was
drafted
and
passed
on
september
3,
1856,
that’s
about
a
125
years
ago.
at
the
time
this
ordinance
was
passed,
of
course,
our
constitutional
was
60,
70
years
old.
this
ordinance
historically
seems
to
be
the
compilation
out
of
blackstone
and
hawkins
approach
to
unlawful
assembly
which
i
think
mr.
lavercombe
alluded
to.
it
was
people
gathering
on
the
street,
so
as
to
put
fear
in
the
hearts
of
for
early
stout
individuals
within
the
community.
this
was
the
opportunity
for
the
community
to
protect
itself
against
unlawful
conduct;
a
conduct
which
was
annoying
because
this
was
a
river
town.
this
was
a
town
we
had
a
lot
of
individuals
coming
down
the
ohio
and
becoming
sometimes
irresponsible
in
our
community.
this
was
--
this
is
an
ordinance
which
has
continued
since
its
passage
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
is
the
first
time
that
it’s
reached,
certainly
this
court,
and
this
is
the
first
time
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
that
i
think
it’s
been
tested
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
difficult
about
the
term
annoying
as
used
in
the
ordinance
which
mr.
lavercombe
and
his
clients
make
their
initial
thrust
against.
they
say
annoying,
we
don’t
understand
what
that
means.
examination
of
dictionaries
used
in
our
high
schools,
colleges,
grammar
schools
indicates
that
annoying
means
to
trouble,
to
vex,
to
impede,
to
incommode.
this
is
the
same
definition
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
applied.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
is
your
question,
if
three
people
stood
outside
a
house
and
smoke
cigarettes?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
and
the
person
inside
determined
that
it
was
annoying,
would
they
fall
within
this
ordinance?
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor
for
this
reason
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
may
it
please
the
court,
based
upon
the
common
sense
approach
to
a
resolution
of
these
cases
as
in
people
versus
harvey
from
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
matter
of
united
states
versus
woodward,
we’re
not
talking
about
the
peculiar
susceptibilities
of
some
individuals
to
annoying.
what
little
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well
your
honor,
may
interpret
it
as
annoying
and
i
don’t
interpret
it
the
same
way
because
i
think
that
we
are
setting
up
a
situation
there
where
we’re
appealing
to
a
particular
susceptitude
or
attitude
of
the
individual
involved.
what
we’re
talking
about
with
regard
to
this
law
or
any
law
your
honor
is
common
sense
approach
to
law.
we’re
not
--
i
don’t
think
that
this
ordinance
or
any
statute
or
any
law
or
any
regulation
with
regard
in
control
of
conduct
should
be
drafted
so
that
you
have
to
be
a
student
of
the
harvard
law
school
before
you
understood
what
was
involved,
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
ordinance
requires
that.
i
think
this
is
an
ordinance
drawn
in
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
annoying
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
annoying
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
about
a
half
a
million.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know.
if
you
would
know
what
the
individual
inside
that
house
would
consider
to
be
annoying,
but
i
do
know
this.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
are
annoying,
that’s
correct.
and
respectfully
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
that
is
precisely
why
we’re
fortunate
enough
to
have
courts
such
as
this
one
and
trial
courts.
we’re
here
what
three,
four
courts
removed
from
the
trial
court.
i
would
like
to
think
that
as
i
started
to
say
that
ordinances
are
drawn
and
statutes
are
drawn,
so
that
the
common
man
in
the
street
understands
what’s
involved.
i
think,
this
is
one
of
those
statutes.
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
that
we
have
to
reach
down
and
redefine
annoying,
and
then
we
come
up
with
a
definition
of
annoying,
and
then
that
has
to
be
redefined,
and
then
we
come
back
to
the
court
to
redefine
that.
pretty
soon,
annoying
which
is
perfectly
good
term
to
describe
conduct
is
no
longer
understandable
because
it’s
been
defined
four
or
five
times.
and
now
people
are
the
total
loss
as
to
what
annoying
really
means.
and
it’s
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
respectfully
your
honor
as
i
recollect
this
case,
a
record
was
made.
however,
only
a
portion
of
the
record
came
up
on
appeal.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
we
could
have
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
could
have,
yes.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
i’ve
to
conceive,
perhaps,
that’s
true.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
based
upon
the
posture
of
the
case
is
it
appears
before
you,
it’s
my
request
that
you
affirm
the
court
below.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
we
think
that
these
--
we
think
that
the
statute
on
it
face
is
not
vague,
nor
overbroad
or
does
not
suffer
from
any
constitutional
and
infirmity.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
honor,
i
concede
that
in
all
human
events,
we
all
must
make
judgments
and
have
some
doubt
about
what
our
position
maybe.
but
i
further
suggest
to
this
court
that
from
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
case
of
people
versus
harvey
to
the
state
of
california
in
the
case
of
fernandez
versus
clinger,
nobody
has
any
trouble
with
annoying;
maybe
they
do
in
cincinnati.
but
in
those
cases,
though
the
term
annoy
was
specifically
under
consideration,
and
in
fernandez
versus
clinger,
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
about
1966.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
the
highest
court
for
the
state
of
california
said
with
regard
to
term
annoy
and
the
citation
is
346
f.2nd
at
page
212,
“the
words
molest
or
annoy
have
accepted
community
meanings
and
are
appropriate
standards
for
a
criminal
statute.”
in
people
versus
harvey
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no,
it’s
not
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
people
versus
harvey,
307
new
york
588,
1954.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
there
are
actually
five
defendants.
one
of
whom
was
a
demonstrator
against
the
vietnamese
war
and
the
other
four
were
on
the
picket
line
at
a
manufacturing
company
in
cincinnati.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
the
picketing
was
so
--
was
such
that
they
blocked
the
public
sidewalk,
they
blocked
the
street
and
driveways,
would
not
allowed
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
responding
to
your
honor’s
first
question
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
we
have
such
an
ordinance,
and
i
think
that
ordinance
like
this
ordinance
says
to
the
operator
of
an
automobile
or
one
who
wishes
to
harangue
his
brothers
on
the
street,
you
must
do
so
as
a
reasonable
man.
you
must
operate
within
the
limits
of
your
demonstration.
you
must
operate
within
the
limits
of
the
reasonable
man
using
due
care
with
what
you’re
about.
there
are
--
i
don’t
know
if
i’ve
totally
respondent
to
you
--
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
other
than
to
say
that
throughout
the
law,
there
are
those
areas
which
can’t
be
uniformly
and
minutely
defined
because
when
that
happens,
then
nobody
knows
what
the
law
is.
judge
white
who
is
sitting
as
a
district
judge
in
a
northern
district
of
ohio,
western
division
rendered
in
a
decision
on
december
18,
1970
which
i
think
carries
some
very
good
language
with
regard
that
what
where
about
here
today.
and
in
that
case
which
is
steinberg
versus
rhodes
which
has
not
been
reported
yet,
but
his
case
number
c-70
289,
december
18,
1970.
the
case
involved
construction
of
language
with
regard
to
an
abortion
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio.
judge
white
said
on
--
with
regard
to
the
approach
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
he
says
that
it
appears
to
us
that
the
vagueness
which
disturbs
the
plaintiffs
herein
results
from
their
own
strange
construction
of
the
language
used,
coupled
with
the
modern
notion
among
law
review
writers
that
anything
that
is
not
coached
in
numerous
paragraphs
of
fine
spun
legal
terminology
is
to
imprecise
to
support
a
criminal
conviction.
he
went
on
to
say
the
words
of
the
ohio
statute
in
this
particular
case
have
over
a
long
period
of
years
proved
entirely
adequate
to
inform
the
public,
both
way
and
professional
what
is
forbidden.
we
think
both
of
those
points
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
western
division,
yes
your
honor,
and
was
sitting
as
one
of
a
three-judge-court.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
three-judge-court.
we
think
that
language
has
some
significance
because
all
through
the
law,
its
common
sense
and
common
sense
as
that
you
shall
not
annoy
your
neighbors.
common
sense
also
says
your
neighbors
shall
but
not
be
so
critical
that
he
is
going
to
apply
an
impossible
standard.
that’s
our
whole
judicial
system.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i’m
not
suggesting
that
it
should
just
be
--
that
we
can
codify
annoyance
period
as
a
crime.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
i
humbly
suggest
that
it
was
the
appellant’s
decision
to
come
the
road
that
they
did
and
that
we
have
responded
and
that
this
court
at
this
point
should
affirm
the
court
of
ohio
--
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
dismiss
the
case
or
affirm.
i
think
that
the
--
this
court
should
affirm
the
court
below.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that
the
statute
is
not
vague
nor
overbroad
on
its
face.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
yes
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
didn’t
hear
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
this
is
the
first
time
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
ruled
on
this
or
any
similar
ordinance
of
its
particular
type.
there
was
one
other
case,
that’s
beecher
(ph)
versus
columbus
which
was
the
loud
dog
barking
case
which
did
come
up,
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
the
law
unconstitutional
because
it
didn’t
establish
a
vicinity
of
annoyance,
that
your
going
to
have
a
barking
dog
on
the
east
side
of
columbus,
somebody
on
the
west
side,
get
an
affidavit
that
it
was
totally
unworkable.
that’s
not
our
case.
we’ve
defined
the
area
in
which
the
activity
is
determined
to
be
criminal
with
specificity.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
honor,
respectfully,
i
would
say
that
the
activity
is
defined
as
it
relates
to
the
relationship
of
one
human
being
to
another.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
or
three
or
more
--
two
plus
one
other,
yes.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
three
or
more
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
if
--
judgment,
i
think
is
perhaps
an
element
here
and
this
court,
judge
holmes
in
the
matter
of
nash
versus
the
united
states
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
but
a
case
i
ran
across
when
preparing
for
argument
here,
that’s
recorded
in
229
united
states
373.
it’s
1913
antitrust
criminal
case.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
term
unduly
was
a
term
that
was
so
broad
and
vague
that
a
man
could
act
to
his
peril
and
face
imprisonment
because
his
activities
were
such
that
they
unduly
restrained
trade.
and
judge
--
justice
holmes
said,
the
law
is
full
of
instances
where
a
man’s
fate
depends
upon
his
judgment.
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
a
man
must
estimate
rightly,
correctly,
and
that
is
as
the
jury
subsequently
estimates
that
conduct.
and
that
if
that
individual
fails
in
judging
his
conduct
by
contemporary
standards,
he
may
not
only
suffer
a
fine
or
imprisonment,
but
he
may
lose
his
life.
what
we’re
talking
about
here
is
the
judgment
of
an
individual
in
the
intercourse
social
activity
within
his
community
based
upon
contemporary
standards,
and
i
submit
that
if
we
constantly
have
to
redefine
each
and
every
term,
which
is
a
term
of
i
think
common
understanding
as
the
court
in
fernandez
versus
clinger
and
people
versus
harvey
thought
it
was,
then,
we’ll
have
even
more
problems
across
this
land
because
people
will
say
does
annoy
really
mean
what
webster’s
says
or
it
does
means
something
else
or
what’s
it
all
about.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
question
is
do
i
think
that
everything
that
i
might
consider
to
be
annoying
would
be
a
crime?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
but
base
upon
contemporary
standards
as
to
what
a
reasonable
man
who
would
be
law
abiding
with
common
intelligence
will
consider.
i
think
is
the
issue
as
in
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
if
the
ordinance
or
statute
were
drafted
in
that
manner,
yes.
i
think
under
the
contemporary
standards
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
pardon
me?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i
don’t
think
just
the
word
annoy.
but
if
one
were
to
draw
an
ordinance
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
right.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
respectfully
your
honor,
loudness
or
the
decibel
level
which
you
would
have
to
reach,
i
think
would
again
based
upon
the
reasonable
man
test
would
depend
on
where
you
were.
if
you
are
in
the
ball
park
and
cheering
your
team
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
yes.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
not
if
across
the
street
was
a
residential
--
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
you
question.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
oh,
i
think
it’s
conceivable
that
there
could
be
people
within
the
neighborhood
you
describe
who
would
have
a
different
of
tolerance
for
annoyance.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
because
their
tolerance
is
a
one
level
or
another
that
the
activity
is
in
of
itself
a
criminal.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
nope,
only
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
i
would
say
this
that
there’s
no
yard
stick
with
regard
to
the
decibel
level
outside
your
house
in
that
neighborhood,
nor
if
i
lived
across
the
street
outside
my
house.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
certainly
should
think
so.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no,
i
don’t’
believe
so.
no
not
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
not
just
to
that
degree
because
if
your
position
was
that
my
mere
walking
by
and
if
i
had
the
clicking
of
my
heels
was
annoying
to
you,
i
think
that’s
totally
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
or
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
test
because
if
that
were
the
test,
that’s
exactly
the
problem
we’re
having
here.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
to
say
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
but
the
merely
--
well,
respectfully
if
i
may
please
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
have
some
more
facts
than
just
that
you
are
merely
annoyed.
i
don’t
think
that
that
conclusion
reaches
the
conviction.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
our
feeling
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
failure
of
the
appellant
here
to
present
facts
has
been
a
problem
for
us
as
well
in
this
matter,
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court
very
briefly,
the
broad
statement
that
mr.
lavercombe
made
with
regard
to
the
activity
involved,
is
correct.
what
happened
was
on
december
7,
1967
with
regard
to
the
defendant
coates,
he
and
several
confederates
gathered
outside
the
united
states
federal
building
in
downtown,
cincinnati,
which
is
directly
across
main
street
from
the
post
office
and
courthouse.
and
there
coates
and
his
confederates
where
demonstrating
against
the
vietnamese
war
and
the
selective
service
system.
their
demonstration
went
so
far
as
to
block
the
doors
to
the
federal
building
so
that
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
to
assist
the
court
with
regard
to
this
matter
because
there
was
--
there
were
several
questions
with
regards
to
the
facts.
if
your
honors
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
this
is
what
--
as
i
indicated
your
honor,
this
is
one
of
the
problems
that
we
as
appellees
have
had
with
regard
to
this
case.
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
which
is
the
complaint
that
brings
this
case
to
this
court,
we
don’t
think
that
section
901-l6
of
the
cincinnati
code
of
ordinances
is
vague
nor
is
it
overbroad.
speaking
to
that
point
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
the
language
is
different
in
that
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
of
the
city
of
cincinnati
provides
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
an
individual
to
conduct
himself
in
a
noisy,
rude,
boisterous
or
insulting
matter
within
the
city
of
cincinnati.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
different
in
the
sense
that
it’s
--
that
is
one
individual
different
in
the
language
that
it’s
used.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
this
requires
--
this
might
be
classified,
if
it
please
your
honors
as
perhaps
a
group
disorderly
conduct
ordinance.
but
i
think,
we
have
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
oh,
i
think
they
could
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
its
conduct
which
is
troubling,
annoying,
vexatious
conduct
that
blocks
the
street,
stops
commerce,
stops
pedestrians.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
both
ordinances
at
the
same
time?
i
think,
there
are
those
situations
probably
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
would
suggest
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
would
not
happen.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
we
probably
could
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
pardon
me?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
if
they
tried
of
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i
don’t
think
we
could
do
that
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
we
stack
up
the
charges
one
after
the
other
and
shotgun
the
case.
i
don’t
think
that’s
all
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
either;
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
don’t
think
so
or
i
don’t
think
we
could
try,
that
we
can
set
a
defender
up
and
shoot
him
down
like
that
if
you
will
with
the
variety
of
charges,
such
as
we
often
times
find
in
the
traffic
area
where
over
zealous
police
officers
quite
candidly,
set
somebody
up
with
driving
one
of
the
influence
of
alcohol,
reckless
operation
and
a
myriad
of
other
things.
this
is
totally
wrong.
i
don’t
think
in
this
case
that
we
could
charge,
nor
could
we
try
individuals
engaged
in
that
conduct
for
both
disorderly
conduct
and
loitering.
if
i
may
respond
just
a
bit
further
with
regard
to
this
ordinance.
this
ordinance
was
drafted
and
passed
on
september
3,
1856,
that’s
about
a
125
years
ago.
at
the
time
this
ordinance
was
passed,
of
course,
our
constitutional
was
60,
70
years
old.
this
ordinance
historically
seems
to
be
the
compilation
out
of
blackstone
and
hawkins
approach
to
unlawful
assembly
which
i
think
mr.
lavercombe
alluded
to.
it
was
people
gathering
on
the
street,
so
as
to
put
fear
in
the
hearts
of
for
early
stout
individuals
within
the
community.
this
was
the
opportunity
for
the
community
to
protect
itself
against
unlawful
conduct;
a
conduct
which
was
annoying
because
this
was
a
river
town.
this
was
a
town
we
had
a
lot
of
individuals
coming
down
the
ohio
and
becoming
sometimes
irresponsible
in
our
community.
this
was
--
this
is
an
ordinance
which
has
continued
since
its
passage
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
is
the
first
time
that
it’s
reached,
certainly
this
court,
and
this
is
the
first
time
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
that
i
think
it’s
been
tested
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
difficult
about
the
term
annoying
as
used
in
the
ordinance
which
mr.
lavercombe
and
his
clients
make
their
initial
thrust
against.
they
say
annoying,
we
don’t
understand
what
that
means.
examination
of
dictionaries
used
in
our
high
schools,
colleges,
grammar
schools
indicates
that
annoying
means
to
trouble,
to
vex,
to
impede,
to
incommode.
this
is
the
same
definition
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
applied.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
is
your
question,
if
three
people
stood
outside
a
house
and
smoke
cigarettes?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
and
the
person
inside
determined
that
it
was
annoying,
would
they
fall
within
this
ordinance?
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor
for
this
reason
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
may
it
please
the
court,
based
upon
the
common
sense
approach
to
a
resolution
of
these
cases
as
in
people
versus
harvey
from
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
matter
of
united
states
versus
woodward,
we’re
not
talking
about
the
peculiar
susceptibilities
of
some
individuals
to
annoying.
what
little
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well
your
honor,
may
interpret
it
as
annoying
and
i
don’t
interpret
it
the
same
way
because
i
think
that
we
are
setting
up
a
situation
there
where
we’re
appealing
to
a
particular
susceptitude
or
attitude
of
the
individual
involved.
what
we’re
talking
about
with
regard
to
this
law
or
any
law
your
honor
is
common
sense
approach
to
law.
we’re
not
--
i
don’t
think
that
this
ordinance
or
any
statute
or
any
law
or
any
regulation
with
regard
in
control
of
conduct
should
be
drafted
so
that
you
have
to
be
a
student
of
the
harvard
law
school
before
you
understood
what
was
involved,
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
ordinance
requires
that.
i
think
this
is
an
ordinance
drawn
in
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
annoying
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
annoying
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
about
a
half
a
million.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know.
if
you
would
know
what
the
individual
inside
that
house
would
consider
to
be
annoying,
but
i
do
know
this.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
are
annoying,
that’s
correct.
and
respectfully
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
that
is
precisely
why
we’re
fortunate
enough
to
have
courts
such
as
this
one
and
trial
courts.
we’re
here
what
three,
four
courts
removed
from
the
trial
court.
i
would
like
to
think
that
as
i
started
to
say
that
ordinances
are
drawn
and
statutes
are
drawn,
so
that
the
common
man
in
the
street
understands
what’s
involved.
i
think,
this
is
one
of
those
statutes.
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
that
we
have
to
reach
down
and
redefine
annoying,
and
then
we
come
up
with
a
definition
of
annoying,
and
then
that
has
to
be
redefined,
and
then
we
come
back
to
the
court
to
redefine
that.
pretty
soon,
annoying
which
is
perfectly
good
term
to
describe
conduct
is
no
longer
understandable
because
it’s
been
defined
four
or
five
times.
and
now
people
are
the
total
loss
as
to
what
annoying
really
means.
and
it’s
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
respectfully
your
honor
as
i
recollect
this
case,
a
record
was
made.
however,
only
a
portion
of
the
record
came
up
on
appeal.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
we
could
have
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
could
have,
yes.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
i’ve
to
conceive,
perhaps,
that’s
true.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
based
upon
the
posture
of
the
case
is
it
appears
before
you,
it’s
my
request
that
you
affirm
the
court
below.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
we
think
that
these
--
we
think
that
the
statute
on
it
face
is
not
vague,
nor
overbroad
or
does
not
suffer
from
any
constitutional
and
infirmity.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
honor,
i
concede
that
in
all
human
events,
we
all
must
make
judgments
and
have
some
doubt
about
what
our
position
maybe.
but
i
further
suggest
to
this
court
that
from
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
case
of
people
versus
harvey
to
the
state
of
california
in
the
case
of
fernandez
versus
clinger,
nobody
has
any
trouble
with
annoying;
maybe
they
do
in
cincinnati.
but
in
those
cases,
though
the
term
annoy
was
specifically
under
consideration,
and
in
fernandez
versus
clinger,
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
about
1966.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
the
highest
court
for
the
state
of
california
said
with
regard
to
term
annoy
and
the
citation
is
346
f.2nd
at
page
212,
“the
words
molest
or
annoy
have
accepted
community
meanings
and
are
appropriate
standards
for
a
criminal
statute.”
in
people
versus
harvey
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no,
it’s
not
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
people
versus
harvey,
307
new
york
588,
1954.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
there
are
actually
five
defendants.
one
of
whom
was
a
demonstrator
against
the
vietnamese
war
and
the
other
four
were
on
the
picket
line
at
a
manufacturing
company
in
cincinnati.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
the
picketing
was
so
--
was
such
that
they
blocked
the
public
sidewalk,
they
blocked
the
street
and
driveways,
would
not
allowed
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
responding
to
your
honor’s
first
question
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
we
have
such
an
ordinance,
and
i
think
that
ordinance
like
this
ordinance
says
to
the
operator
of
an
automobile
or
one
who
wishes
to
harangue
his
brothers
on
the
street,
you
must
do
so
as
a
reasonable
man.
you
must
operate
within
the
limits
of
your
demonstration.
you
must
operate
within
the
limits
of
the
reasonable
man
using
due
care
with
what
you’re
about.
there
are
--
i
don’t
know
if
i’ve
totally
respondent
to
you
--
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
other
than
to
say
that
throughout
the
law,
there
are
those
areas
which
can’t
be
uniformly
and
minutely
defined
because
when
that
happens,
then
nobody
knows
what
the
law
is.

in
a
northern
district
of
ohio,
western
division
rendered
in
a
decision
on
december
18,
1970
which
i
think
carries
some
very
good
language
with
regard
that
what
where
about
here
today.
and
in
that
case
which
is
steinberg
versus
rhodes
which
has
not
been
reported
yet,
but
his
case
number
c-70
289,
december
18,
1970.
the
case
involved
construction
of
language
with
regard
to
an
abortion
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio.
judge
white
said
on
--
with
regard
to
the
approach
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
he
says
that
it
appears
to
us
that
the
vagueness
which
disturbs
the
plaintiffs
herein
results
from
their
own
strange
construction
of
the
language
used,
coupled
with
the
modern
notion
among
law
review
writers
that
anything
that
is
not
coached
in
numerous
paragraphs
of
fine
spun
legal
terminology
is
to
imprecise
to
support
a
criminal
conviction.
he
went
on
to
say
the
words
of
the
ohio
statute
in
this
particular
case
have
over
a
long
period
of
years
proved
entirely
adequate
to
inform
the
public,
both
way
and
professional
what
is
forbidden.
we
think
both
of
those
points
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
western
division,
yes
your
honor,
and
was
sitting
as
one
of
a
three-judge-court.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
three-judge-court.
we
think
that
language
has
some
significance
because
all
through
the
law,
its
common
sense
and
common
sense
as
that
you
shall
not
annoy
your
neighbors.
common
sense
also
says
your
neighbors
shall
but
not
be
so
critical
that
he
is
going
to
apply
an
impossible
standard.
that’s
our
whole
judicial
system.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i’m
not
suggesting
that
it
should
just
be
--
that
we
can
codify
annoyance
period
as
a
crime.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
i
humbly
suggest
that
it
was
the
appellant’s
decision
to
come
the
road
that
they
did
and
that
we
have
responded
and
that
this
court
at
this
point
should
affirm
the
court
of
ohio
--
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
dismiss
the
case
or
affirm.
i
think
that
the
--
this
court
should
affirm
the
court
below.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that
the
statute
is
not
vague
nor
overbroad
on
its
face.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
yes
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
didn’t
hear
your
honor.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
this
is
the
first
time
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
ruled
on
this
or
any
similar
ordinance
of
its
particular
type.
there
was
one
other
case,
that’s
beecher
(ph)
versus
columbus
which
was
the
loud
dog
barking
case
which
did
come
up,
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
the
law
unconstitutional
because
it
didn’t
establish
a
vicinity
of
annoyance,
that
your
going
to
have
a
barking
dog
on
the
east
side
of
columbus,
somebody
on
the
west
side,
get
an
affidavit
that
it
was
totally
unworkable.
that’s
not
our
case.
we’ve
defined
the
area
in
which
the
activity
is
determined
to
be
criminal
with
specificity.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
honor,
respectfully,
i
would
say
that
the
activity
is
defined
as
it
relates
to
the
relationship
of
one
human
being
to
another.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
or
three
or
more
--
two
plus
one
other,
yes.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
three
or
more
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
if
--
judgment,
i
think
is
perhaps
an
element
here
and
this
court,
judge
holmes
in
the
matter
of
nash
versus
the
united
states
which
is
not
in
our
brief,
but
a
case
i
ran
across
when
preparing
for
argument
here,
that’s
recorded
in
229
united
states
373.
it’s
1913
antitrust
criminal
case.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
term
unduly
was
a
term
that
was
so
broad
and
vague
that
a
man
could
act
to
his
peril
and
face
imprisonment
because
his
activities
were
such
that
they
unduly
restrained
trade.
and
judge
--
justice
holmes
said,
the
law
is
full
of
instances
where
a
man’s
fate
depends
upon
his
judgment.
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
a
man
must
estimate
rightly,
correctly,
and
that
is
as
the
jury
subsequently
estimates
that
conduct.
and
that
if
that
individual
fails
in
judging
his
conduct
by
contemporary
standards,
he
may
not
only
suffer
a
fine
or
imprisonment,
but
he
may
lose
his
life.
what
we’re
talking
about
here
is
the
judgment
of
an
individual
in
the
intercourse
social
activity
within
his
community
based
upon
contemporary
standards,
and
i
submit
that
if
we
constantly
have
to
redefine
each
and
every
term,
which
is
a
term
of
i
think
common
understanding
as
the
court
in
fernandez
versus
clinger
and
people
versus
harvey
thought
it
was,
then,
we’ll
have
even
more
problems
across
this
land
because
people
will
say
does
annoy
really
mean
what
webster’s
says
or
it
does
means
something
else
or
what’s
it
all
about.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
your
question
is
do
i
think
that
everything
that
i
might
consider
to
be
annoying
would
be
a
crime?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
but
base
upon
contemporary
standards
as
to
what
a
reasonable
man
who
would
be
law
abiding
with
common
intelligence
will
consider.
i
think
is
the
issue
as
in
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
if
the
ordinance
or
statute
were
drafted
in
that
manner,
yes.
i
think
under
the
contemporary
standards
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
pardon
me?
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no.
i
don’t
think
just
the
word
annoy.
but
if
one
were
to
draw
an
ordinance
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
right.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
respectfully
your
honor,
loudness
or
the
decibel
level
which
you
would
have
to
reach,
i
think
would
again
based
upon
the
reasonable
man
test
would
depend
on
where
you
were.
if
you
are
in
the
ball
park
and
cheering
your
team
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
yes.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
not
if
across
the
street
was
a
residential
--
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
you
question.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
oh,
i
think
it’s
conceivable
that
there
could
be
people
within
the
neighborhood
you
describe
who
would
have
a
different
of
tolerance
for
annoyance.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
because
their
tolerance
is
a
one
level
or
another
that
the
activity
is
in
of
itself
a
criminal.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
nope,
only
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
well,
i
would
say
this
that
there’s
no
yard
stick
with
regard
to
the
decibel
level
outside
your
house
in
that
neighborhood,
nor
if
i
lived
across
the
street
outside
my
house.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
i
certainly
should
think
so.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no,
i
don’t’
believe
so.
no
not
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
not
just
to
that
degree
because
if
your
position
was
that
my
mere
walking
by
and
if
i
had
the
clicking
of
my
heels
was
annoying
to
you,
i
think
that’s
totally
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
or
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
test
because
if
that
were
the
test,
that’s
exactly
the
problem
we’re
having
here.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
to
say
--
mr.
a.
david
nichols
but
the
merely
--
well,
respectfully
if
i
may
please
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
have
some
more
facts
than
just
that
you
are
merely
annoyed.
i
don’t
think
that
that
conclusion
reaches
the
conviction.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
david
nichols
that’s
our
feeling
your
honor.
