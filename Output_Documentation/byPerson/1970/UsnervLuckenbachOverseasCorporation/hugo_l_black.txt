justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
it
been
since
the
first
case
which
you
referred
was
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
mahnich?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
congress
taken
any
action
since
those
cases
were
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
on
the
panel
who
decided
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
again
please?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
talking
about
the
truck
driver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
just
said
that
this
case
has
led
to
appear
that
a
man
could
not
have
been
on
the
ship
and
wasn't
going
into
the
ship
but
was
driving
out
of
town.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
case
wasn't
detailed
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thats
not
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
equipment
you
are
talking
about
that
was
attached
to
the
ship,
it
was
actually
defective
and
had
been
defective
six
months.
no
good,
would
you
say
that
was
something
that
affected
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
be
actionable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
ship
unseaworthy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
an
equipment
and
other
was
equipment.
you
mean
the
ship
itself
as
a
whole
has
to
be
unsound?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
dont
need
to
indulge
in
much
of
a
fiction
to
relate
that
to
the
ship
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
do
you
have
to
indulge
on
the
fiction
to
relate
this
to
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
believe
we
can
take
up
those
cases
all
together.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
it
is
a
new
departure
from
waldron?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
thats
instantaneous
isn't
it?
the
order
is
given,
they
put
two
men
where
they
would
have
four,
thats
negligence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
hold
that
they
are
allowed
with
the
lack
of
seaworthiness,
should
that
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
unseaworthiness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
it
sent
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
moment,
the
next
moment,
they
might
have
required
one
man
or
four
men
or
five
men.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
your
argument.
those
cases
should
be
overruled.
we
dont
agree
with
it
but
i
dont
understand
your
argument
that
we
havent
cited
against
you
in
this
case
previously.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
kohlmeyer,
if
i
may,
did
you
say
that
if
somebody
on
board
ship
negligently
drops
grease
and
the
next
man
coming
by
slips,
the
ship
is
unseaworthy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
this
man
who
negligently
for
a
moment
let
that
sling
down
too
fast,
had
dropped
the
grease
and
a
man
had
been
injured,
you
wouldnt
be
here
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
dont
see
the
difference
between
negligently
dropping
the
grease
and
negligently
slipping
on
the
winch.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
grease
is
the
condition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
separates
it
to--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
percentage
of
the
ships
or
boats
you
suppose
that
operate
have
insurance
policies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
accidents
of
this
type.
justice
hugo
l.
black
100%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
question
of
which
insurance
company
in
the
end
has
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
have
serious
enough
injuries,
the
public
will
have
to
bear
the
injuries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
judgment
from
a
million
dollars?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
summary
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
okay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
you
said
that
--
originated
that
idea
or
concept
originated
under
fifth
circuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
cases?
justice
hugo

black
you
cited
in
your

justice

who
wrote
the
