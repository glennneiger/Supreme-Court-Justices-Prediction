justice
potter
stewart
if
you
put
your
thesis
together
with
ryan
and
the
--
do
you
think
you'll
run
into
any
problems
or
incongruities
in
relation
to
the
provisions
of
the
longshoreman
in
the
harbor
workers
act,
these
were
stevedores
werent
they
who
were
heard?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
gives
rise
to
any
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
it's
certainly
gone
right
down
the
line
up
to
date
on
what
you're
arguing.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i'm
just
suggesting,
i
suppose
there
comes
on
recourse
of
legal
development
or
one
might
take
a
new
look.
justice
potter
stewart
thats
the
reason
mr.
brumfield
i
dont
see
why
it
has
--
why
the
act
has
to
be
a
negligent
act
and
its
under
your
submission
and
your
theory.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
act,
any
very
careful
act
on
the
part
of
the
seaman
on
a
well
equipped
and
a
very
seaworthy
ship,
any
very,
very
careful
act
that
just
happens
to
injure
somebody
who
would
under
your
theory
create
an
unseaworthy
ship
and
create
liability
on
the
part
of
the
ship
owner
for
unseaworthiness
wouldnt
that
be
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
condition
need
not
have
been
caused
by
any
negligence
or
by
any
fault
at
all,
thats
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
for
example
the
mitchell
case
there,
there
was
gurry
on
the
ship's
railing
--
nobody
knew
whether
that
anybody
was
negligent
in
causing
that
condition,
that
wasnt
an
element
on
the
case.
is
that
correct
or
am
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
one
knew
how
it
came
to
be
there
whether
it
was
through
the
fault
of
anybody.
that
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
that
would
be
unseaworthiness
would
you
agree
or
not
--
whether
or
not
the
man
who
dropped
it
was
negligent
in
dropping
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
might
have
been
very
careful
in
dropping
it.
he
might
not
have
been
negligent
at
all.
nonetheless,
if
there's
a
greasy
deck,
thats
an
unseaworthy
condition
and
the
man
following
him
could
collect
against
the
ship
owner
for
an
unseaworthy
ship
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
negligence
has
nothing
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kohlmeyer
--
excuse
me,
have
you
finished
your
answer
to
justice
harlans
question?
excuse
me.
this
action
was
according
to
judge
simpson
in
the
fifth
circuit
involved
a
claim
based
on
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
and
i
noticed
that
as
you
correctly
said
in
an
answer
to
my
brother
black
a
moment
or
two,
though
you
got
a
summary
judgment,
what
happened
to
the
negligence
claim?
it's
almost
considered
at
least
here
--
at
least
arguendo
that
there
was
negligence
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
wouldnt
be
an
act
for
negligence.
justice
potter
stewart
his
remedies
would
be
limited
by
the
federal
harbor
workers
longshoreman
act.
justice
potter
stewart
if
indeed,
the
man
who
was
negligent
was
an
employee
of
the
same
employer,
it
was
a
longshoreman.
justice
potter
stewart
then
his
recovery
would
be
limited
to
that
federal
workmans
compensation
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
distance
so
remote
from
the
ship
has
never
been
thought
to
be
controlling
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
generally,
there
is
that
maintenance
in
your
case
where
the
sailor
went
off
on
liberty
and
fell
out
of
the
window
of
(inaudible)
and
was
held--
justice

stewart
if
