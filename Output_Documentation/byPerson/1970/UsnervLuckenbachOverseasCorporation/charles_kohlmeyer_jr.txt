mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
addressing
ourselves
first
to
the
question
just
asked
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it's
our
submission
that
the
court
could
not
in
mascuilli
have
meant
the
reversal
to
be
on
operational
negligence
basis.
the
concept
was
new
to
the
court.
the
concept
was
a
very
large
one
affecting
an
entire
industry
and
it
is
generally
thought
by
the
bench
and
bar
we
believe
that
the
court
would
not
have
summarily
treated
such
an
important
subject.
on
the
other
hand,
mascuilli
did
in
fact
have
as
its
basis
the,
tight
line
situation
that
did
come
up
in
crumady.
it
did
have
as
a
potential,
the
same
type
of
thing,
accident
that
happened
in
crumady.
there
were
no
electric
cutout
switches
in
mascuilli
and
it
wouldve
been
very
easy
for
the
court
in
mascuilli
to
have
pitched
--
i'm
talking
about
the
district
court
now
--
to
have
pitched
its
decision
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
on
an
unseaworthiness
basis
not
an
operational
negligence
basis
but
on
the
basis
that
the
ship
was
improperly
rigged.
and
the
condition
that
we
say
must
be
incident
of
any
case
where
liability
is
imposed
on
the
ship.
that
condition
did
then
exist
at
that
time.
certainly,
the
citation
of
mahnich
and
crumady
does
not
give
rise
to
any
thought
that
this
court
is
reversing
on
a
theory
of
instantaneous
unseaworthiness
or
operational
negligence.
this
is
a
case,
if
the
court
please
and
all
unseaworthiness
cases
are
cases
of
liability
without
fault.
that
is
of
course
true.
this
man
who
was
injured
was
standing
on
a
barge
next
door
to
the
ship
which
was
being
loaded,
the
cargo
was
being
handled
from
the
barge
to
the
ship,
the
sling
was
brought
down
too
quickly,
struck
him,
knocked
him
off
the
barge
and
caused
his
injuries.
he
was
immediately
adjacent
to
the
ship.
there
was
no
unseaworthiness
present
that
we
can
dissent
or
that
anyone
has
suggested
in
the
record.
the
fact
is
that
this
was
operational
negligence
the
winch
man
let
the
swing
down
too
fast.
since
it's
liability
without
fault,
is
it
a
matter
of
having
an
insurance
liability
for
anyone
who
goes
on
and
board
a
ship,
who
has
a
business
on
board
a
ship,
who
is
a
passenger,
who
is
a
workman?
if
so,
then
we
submit,
it's
up
to
congress
to
make
that
decision
or
certainly,
it's
up
to
this
court
to
do
it
and
this
court
has
not
yet
done
it.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
insurer's
liability
as
yet.
if
your
honors
choose
to
make
such
a
decision,
it
will
be
a
future
decision
but
none
exist
on
the
books
as
of
today.
if
however,
it
is
any
act
which
causes
an
injury
to
another
party
on
board
ship
regardless
of
weather,
the
act
is
negligent,
and
regardless
of
whether
the
ship
becomes
unseaworthy,
then
if
the
court
please,
it
is
exactly
that
act
that
is
in
fact
imposing
the
ship
owner
--
the
insurer's
liability
on
the
ship
owner.
and
this
is
what
we
submit
cannot
be
done.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
that
of
course
in
mr.
brumfields
argument
and
i
think
thats
the
answer
to
the
suggestion.
it
cannot
be
that
you
can
put
liability
on
an
act
unless
it's
negligence
or
on
a
condition
unless
it's
unseaworthy
--
unseaworthiness.
now,
if
we
want
to
change
terminology--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
of
course
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that
your
honor
is
correct
in
your
statement
of
the
end
result
that
was
not
an
element
of
the
case.
i
rather
doubt
that
no
one
knew
that
it
was
there.
i
think
it
was
there
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
thats
correct
and
i
would
think
that
it
is
proper
to
state
that
under
the
existing
law,
knowledge
of
the
condition
need
not
be
brought
home
to
the
ship
owner
in
order
to
enforce
liability
on
him
because
it
is
a
liability
without
fault.
it
is
not
the
situation
of
the
conner
grocery
whether
coca
cola
bottle
is
not
off
and
he
leaves
it
there
too
long
and
somebody
steps
on
it
and
is
cut.
if
it's
there
for
a
moment,
it
is
a
condition
whether
the
owner
knows
it
or
not,
it's
still
is
a
condition.
and
when
a
party
is
injured
by
virtue
of
that
condition,
then
there
is
liability.
but
it
is
a
condition
and
it
is
a
condition
which
precedes
the
accident,
precedes
the
injury
and
the
doctrine
presupposes
condition
rather
than
causation
and
in
fact
is
--
this
is
a
definition
i
should
think
of
unseaworthiness.
a
condition
rather
than
causation
the
fact
that
you
know
about
it
or
dont
know
about
it
is
of
no
moment
because
as
you
point
out,
it
is
a
liability
without
fault.
in
the
case
of
mascuilli
to
revert
to
it
one
more
time
if
i
may
and
then
set
digressed,
certainly,
it
is
not
an
easy
case,
easy
decision
to
understand.
and
certainly,
the
second
circuit
takes
one
view
of
the
interpretation
and
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
take
it
completely
and
irreconcilably
opposite
view
of
the
same
decision.
so
that
we
do
have
a
direct
conflict
in
the
twos
--
in
the
three
circuits.
two
on
the
one
side
and
the
one
on
the
other
with
possibly
the
third
and
the
fourth
mixing
in
some
may
say
in
favor
of
the
second
and
some
may
say
in
favor
of
the
fifth
but
certainly,
there
are
two
circuits
at
least
on
the
one
side
and
one
at
least
on
the
other
side
and
the
views
are
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
1920
i
believe.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
dating
back
even
further
than
that
but
say
to
the
oceola,
yes,
you
had
your
remedy
for
unseaworthiness
at
the
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that
--
frankly,
i
have
not.
no,
if
the
court
please
but
the
jones
act
is
presently
interpreted
as
being
an
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it's
presently
interpreted
as
presenting
--
as
giving
an
exclusive
remedy
to
a
seaman.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
he
embraces
unseaworthiness
action
on
to
his
negligence
action
and
brings
it
both
in
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
if
the
court
please
and
i
couldnt
answer
the
question.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
think
however
that
the
sieracki
type
of
seaman
such
as
we're
dealing
with
here
would
be
covered
by
the
same
type
of
hearing
that
your
honor
is
referring
to.
because
i
think
the
hearings
insofar
as
the
jones
act
are
concerned
would
be
limited
to
seaman
as
such
to
the
man
who
work
on
board
ships
and
not
to
the
harbor
workers
who
have
been
given
seaman
rights
in
the
so
called
sieracki
seaman
who
got
their
rights
following
the
sieracki
case
rather
than
from
the
legislation
and
the
jones
act.
i
believe
that
these
cases
that
we're
getting
now
are
going
much
further
than
the
court
ever
dreamt
that
they
could
go.
in
the
fifth
circuit
at
least,
we're
getting
further
and
further
away
from
the
ship
as
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
grows
and
as
this
instantaneous
negligence
doctrine
could
grow.
if
this
case
were
to
be
decided
adversely
to
the
position
we
take,
under
the
case
law
that
is
now
coming
up,
it
would
be
possible
for
a
truck
driver
to
negligently
operate
a
truck
on
his
way
to
a
roof
(ph)
up
here
and
for
the
ship
to
become
responsible
for
his
injuries
by
reason
of
his
having
been
--
the
ship
having
become
unseaworthy.
the
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
the
fifth
circuit
right
now,
there
are
--
there
is
case
law
and
i
should
imagine
that
your
honors
will
get
these
cases
on
writs.
there
are
two
cases
decided
in
september,
the
lower
case
and
the
chagois
case
where
one;
a
man
is
discharging
a
real
car
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
the
other
one
is
the
lift
truck
driver
who
is
on
the
roof
hooking
up
to
this
lift
truck
driver
in
the
fifth
circuit
case
was
moving
some
cargo
on
the
roof
to
get
it
near
to
the
ship
and
what
they
call
headache
rack
on
top
of
the
protection,
on
top
of
the
lift
truck
on
the
roof
falls
on
his
head
held
that
he
could
recover
against
the
ship
on
the
grounds
of
unseaworthiness.
now
this
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
this
--
this
is
a
simple
extension
of
that
if
the
court
please
if
when
you're
discharging
a
car
500
feet
away
from
a
ship
and
working
with
a
tool
to
discharge
rice
from
the
car
and
you
get
hurt
discharging
the
car
and
the
court
holds
that
the
ship
is
responsible
for
your
injury
and
the
ship
didnt
furnish
that
tool
when
you're
not
employed
by
the
ship--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
was
the
chagois
case
if
the
court
please
chagois
versus
lykes
brothers--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it's
officially
reported.
it's
an
a
slip
opinion
of
course.
i
think
september
30,
either
september
16
or
september
30,
one
is
the
chagois
against
lykes
brothers
and
the
other
one
is
law
against
sagamore
hill
which
was
decided
on
december
--
september
16.
that
was
the
one
where
the
lift
truck
had
the
headache
rack
fall
on
the
man.
the
other
one
was
the
rice
worker
case
hurting
the
man.
but
these
are
the
extensions
that
you
get
too--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
not
in
this
case.
this
case
is
a
sling
attached
to
the
ship
itself
with
the
man
standing
directly
adjacent
to
the
ship
but
not
on
board
the
ship
which
i
dont
think
could
make
any
difference
although
it
might.
but
he
is
not
on
board
the
ship.
he
is
engaged
in
loading.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
clearly
a
case
of
unseaworthiness
which
would
be
actionable.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
certainly.
we
dont
complain--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
oh
yes.
i
would
think
also
that
there
would
be
very
few
people
who
would
object
to
the
concept
of
a
man
recovering
for
what
we
would
call
true
unseaworthiness.
it's
the
idea
of
bringing
the
unseaworthiness
into
play
where
the
ship
itself
is
perfectly
sound
and
someone
makes
it
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
the
ship
and
its
equipment
be
perfectly
sound.
but
in
the
state
of
the
law
as
i
understand
it
today
if
the
ship
itself
and
all
of
its
equipment
is
completely
sound,
and
a
longshoreman
goes
on
board
the
ship
and
drops
some
grease
on
the
deck
and
the
man
following
him
slips
on
that
grease,
that
ship
is
unseaworthy
and
that
man
can
sue
the
ship
for
his
injuries.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir.
because
that
of
course
happened
on
the
ship
and
that
of
course--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
accident?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
you
dont.
what
i
am
saying
though
if
the
court
please
is
that
if
you
permit
the
operational
negligence
to
substitute
for
unseaworthiness,
if
you
require
that
simple
--
if
you
permit
simple
negligence
to
be
a
substitute
for
unseaworthiness,
then
where
are
you
going
to
get?
you're
going
to
get
these
cases
stretching
further
and
further
away
from
the
ship
and
you're
going
to
be
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
[laughter
attempt]
that
of
course
is
true
but
i
submit
to
the
court
in
all
earnestness
that
there
is
no
reason
for
this
type
of
extension.
this
is
a
new
departure
from
existing
law
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
i
should
think
waldron
is
a
case
that
could
be
very
easily
decided
on
the
same
basis
as
boudoin
against
lykes
that
the
ship
can
be
unseaworthy
and
manpower
as
well
as
an
equipment
and
we've
always
recognized
that.
if
you
put
two
man
on
the
job
that
takes
four
men
to
do,
certainly,
i
should
think
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
and
that
the
two
men
are
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
think
that
the
waldron
case
held
that.
no,
if
the
court
please
i
think
you
sent
it
back
because
the
court
--
the
lower
court
had
taken
the
unseaworthiness
issue
away
from
the
jury.
but
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
but
the
negligence
matter
was
held
against
the
plaintiff
in
the
waldron
case
which
was
the
subject
to
the
dissent
that
was
in
that
case.
where
it
was
held
that
since
there
was
--
since
the
jury
had
found
there
was
no
negligence
in
assigning
two
men
to
do
the
job,
then
it
couldnt
very
well
be
unseaworthy.
the
ship
couldnt
be
unseaworthy
because
there
was
no
lack
of
manpower.
this
is
the
way
i
read
the
case.
nevertheless,
it
was
sent
back
and
it
was
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
it
was
sent
back
on
the
unseaworthiness
issue.
but
still,
it
was
a
condition
because
there
were
two
men
carrying
something
that
the
court
that
might
be
four
men
should
carry--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
true.
but
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
i
dont
think
the
waldron
case
comes
close
to
this
case
if
the
court
please
and
i
think
you
have
to
do
more
than
come
to
that
conclusion
--
come
to
the
conclusion
that
operational
negligence
is
involved
to
get
to
the
result
in
the
waldron
case.
you
dont
need
that
theory
spelled
out
that
way
to
get
to
the
answer
in
the
waldron
case.
in
waldron,
the
condition
was
there.
that
was
the
fact
that
two
men
were
doing
the
work
that
three
or
four
men
should
have
been
doing
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
at
that
moment
--
to
the
same
extent
as
if
an
improper
tool
had
been
given
to
them
to
use.
and
on
that
basis,
you
had
an
incompetent
crew
or
incompetent
--
incomplete
workforce
and
that
made
the
ship
unseaworthy.
but
it
was
a
condition
that
existed
at
the
moment
of
injury
so
i
could
justify
the
waldron
case
without
any
difficulty.
now
all
of
this
stems
i
think
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
think
there's
much
doubt
about
it
on
this
date
at
todays
law,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
guess
i
would
be.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness
is
the
key
note,
i
think
in
the
touchdown
on
which
we
have
to
view
these
cases.
that
concept
we
submit
requires
there
to
be
a
condition.
and
if
you
do
not
have
a
condition,
you
cannot
have
unseaworthiness
by
definition.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
now
if
that
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it.
and
nor
with
the
fact
that
the
ship
owner
had
knowledge
or
did
not
have
knowledge
of
the
existence
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
this
doctrine
we
submit
comes
from
judge
hahns
decision
on
the
second
circuit
in
grileau.
and
in
grileau,
we
feel
that
that
judge
hahn
indicated
at
that
time
that
there
had
to
be
a
time
interval
in
order
to
apply
to
doctrine
that
he
was
speaking
for
then.
if
you
recall,
in
grileau,
there
was
a
hatch
board
cocked
over
a
(inaudible)
unequally
and
the
man
fell
on
the
hatch
board.
but
he
indicated
that
a
time
interval
had
to
elapse.
and
if
you
dont
have
your
time
interval
elapsing,
if
you
dont
have
your
condition
existing,
youve
got
something
that
isn't
unseaworthiness.
now,
i
dont
know
what
it
is
and
of
course,
the
law
can
be
changed,
but
at
this
moment,
it
isn't
unseaworthiness
as
we
know
it
and
as
the
word
is
defined
to
be
because
it
is
not
a
condition
and
you
must
have
a
condition
for
anything
to
be
unseaworthy.
additionally,
the
question
of
what
this
does
to
the
industry
when
you
put
it
together
with
ryan
is
startling
in
its
results.
the
men
who
work
on
the
ships
of
course
are
covered
by
the
compensation
act,
given
the
compensation
by
their
employers,
they
have
their
comp
awarded
to
them
as
their
sole
and
exclusive
remedy.
they
have
their
right
to
a
third
party
action
and
the
third
party
of
course
goes
back
against
the
employer
so
that
in
all
of
these
cases
that
come
to
court,
not
in
all
but
in
99%
i
should
say,
there
is
a
liability
over
charged
against
the
contract
stevedore
or
the
person
--
the
employer
of
the
injured
man.
we
are
getting
the
security
of
action
to
come
right
around
the
corner
back
to
where
the
congress
said
it
could
not
rest.
and
philosophically,
it's
our
submission
that
it
is
unfair
to
foist
upon
anyone,
a
fixed
liability
without
fault
and
yet
put
no
limits
on
that
liability
and
thats
what
this
type
of
result
comes
to.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
$100.00--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
a
hundred.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
the
question
if
you
bring
it
down
to
that
mr.
justice
black
of
how
much
is
the
public
going
to
pay
for
the
service.
because
obviously,
the
public
is
going
to
get
the
charge
passed
along
to
it
in
higher
cost
so
that
doesnt
matter
whether
it's
insured
or
not.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
there's
a
big
difference
i
should
think
between
a
judgment
for
half
a
million
dollars
and
cash
damages
and
a
judgment
for
$102
a
week
or
$122
a
week
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
our
case?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
our
case,
we
got
a
summary
judgment
with
the
defense.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
court
please,
the
case
comes
to
you
on
the
fifth
circuits
statement
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
operational
negligence
constituting
unseaworthiness
which
would
be
actionable
by
an
injured
man.
we
seek
an
affirmance
of
that
ruling.
operational
negligence
as
such
does
not
on
the
part
of
the
contract
stevedore
does
not
give
rise
to
an
action
against
the
ship
for
unseaworthiness.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it's
the
same
thing
if
the
court
please.
instantaneous
negligence
and
operational
negligence
we
would
think
would
be
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
i
think
not
because
i
dont
think
you
have
ever
had
that
decision
unless
you
made
that
decision
in
mascuilli
or
unless
you
made
it
as
mr.
justice
black
says
you
made
it
in
waldron.
i
dont
know
that
you
have.
there
is
no
clear
cut
statement
by
this
court
that
instantaneous
negligence
constitutes
unseaworthiness
or
that
operational
negligence
constitute
unseaworthiness.
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
the
negligence
charge
was
against
the
longshoreman
apparently
if
the
court
please
and
not
against
the
ship.
the
operator
of
the
winch
who
was
the
negligent
party
was
an
employee
of
the
stevedore
and
a
fellow
employee
of
the
injured
plaintiff.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
should
think
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
should
think
that
you're
right.
he
has
no
claim
for
negligence
under
this
concept,
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct,
it's
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
he
can
maintain
a
negligence
action
against
the
ship.
yes,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
it's
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
he
is
given
something
thats
pretty
--
for
all
practical
purposes,
he
can
do
the
same
thing
that
a
seaman
can
do.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
mentions
exactly
how
far
the
occurrence
of
the
injury
was
from
the
ship
itself
but
in
the
chagois
case--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it's
well
away
yes
sir
and
in
the
law
case,
the
sagamore
hill,
they
made
no
bones
about
how
close
it
was
to
the
ship.
the
fact
was
--
the
concept
of
both
cases
was
that
he
was
preparing
cargo
for
loading
on
board
the
ship
and
therefore,
he
was
engaged
in
loading
the
ship
and
therefore,
the
ship
owed
him
a
duty
of
--
owed
him
a
seaworthy
ship
and
not
to
have
him
injured
and
therefore
grant
him
a
recovery.
this
was
the
concept
and
the
approach
that
the
court
gave
to
both
cases.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
i
shouldnt
think
so.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
but
in
this
context,
these
people
are
loading
ships
you
see
and
where
they
are
loading
ships,
you
always
think
that
they
are
right
on
the
ship
but
obviously,
this
wouldnt
apply
if
a
man
was
going
back
and
forth,
on
and
off
the
ship
carrying
cargo
on
his
shoulder,
when
he
was
carrying
it
on
to
the
ship
or
carrying
it
off
of
the
ship.
but
that
isn't
the
way
stevedoring
is
done,
they
have
a
bunch
of
men
that
are
in
the
hole
and
another
bunch
that
are
on
the
shore.
and
the
theory
now
is
that
the
men
on
shore
and
the
theory
now
is
that
the
man
on
shore
has
the
same
rights
as
the
men
on
the
ship.
the
mere
fortuitous
event
that
they
are
posted
to
shore
today
and
not
in
the
ship
today
doesnt
change
their
rights
at
all.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
addressing
ourselves
first
to
the
question
just
asked
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it's
our
submission
that
the
court
could
not
in
mascuilli
have
meant
the
reversal
to
be
on
operational
negligence
basis.
the
concept
was
new
to
the
court.
the
concept
was
a
very
large
one
affecting
an
entire
industry
and
it
is
generally
thought
by
the
bench
and
bar
we
believe
that
the
court
would
not
have
summarily
treated
such
an
important
subject.
on
the
other
hand,
mascuilli
did
in
fact
have
as
its
basis
the,
tight
line
situation
that
did
come
up
in
crumady.
it
did
have
as
a
potential,
the
same
type
of
thing,
accident
that
happened
in
crumady.
there
were
no
electric
cutout
switches
in
mascuilli
and
it
wouldve
been
very
easy
for
the
court
in
mascuilli
to
have
pitched
--
i'm
talking
about
the
district
court
now
--
to
have
pitched
its
decision
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
on
an
unseaworthiness
basis
not
an
operational
negligence
basis
but
on
the
basis
that
the
ship
was
improperly
rigged.
and
the
condition
that
we
say
must
be
incident
of
any
case
where
liability
is
imposed
on
the
ship.
that
condition
did
then
exist
at
that
time.
certainly,
the
citation
of
mahnich
and
crumady
does
not
give
rise
to
any
thought
that
this
court
is
reversing
on
a
theory
of
instantaneous
unseaworthiness
or
operational
negligence.
this
is
a
case,
if
the
court
please
and
all
unseaworthiness
cases
are
cases
of
liability
without
fault.
that
is
of
course
true.
this
man
who
was
injured
was
standing
on
a
barge
next
door
to
the
ship
which
was
being
loaded,
the
cargo
was
being
handled
from
the
barge
to
the
ship,
the
sling
was
brought
down
too
quickly,
struck
him,
knocked
him
off
the
barge
and
caused
his
injuries.
he
was
immediately
adjacent
to
the
ship.
there
was
no
unseaworthiness
present
that
we
can
dissent
or
that
anyone
has
suggested
in
the
record.
the
fact
is
that
this
was
operational
negligence
the
winch
man
let
the
swing
down
too
fast.
since
it's
liability
without
fault,
is
it
a
matter
of
having
an
insurance
liability
for
anyone
who
goes
on
and
board
a
ship,
who
has
a
business
on
board
a
ship,
who
is
a
passenger,
who
is
a
workman?
if
so,
then
we
submit,
it's
up
to
congress
to
make
that
decision
or
certainly,
it's
up
to
this
court
to
do
it
and
this
court
has
not
yet
done
it.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
insurer's
liability
as
yet.
if
your
honors
choose
to
make
such
a
decision,
it
will
be
a
future
decision
but
none
exist
on
the
books
as
of
today.
if
however,
it
is
any
act
which
causes
an
injury
to
another
party
on
board
ship
regardless
of
weather,
the
act
is
negligent,
and
regardless
of
whether
the
ship
becomes
unseaworthy,
then
if
the
court
please,
it
is
exactly
that
act
that
is
in
fact
imposing
the
ship
owner
--
the
insurer's
liability
on
the
ship
owner.
and
this
is
what
we
submit
cannot
be
done.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
that
of
course
in
mr.
brumfields
argument
and
i
think
thats
the
answer
to
the
suggestion.
it
cannot
be
that
you
can
put
liability
on
an
act
unless
it's
negligence
or
on
a
condition
unless
it's
unseaworthy
--
unseaworthiness.
now,
if
we
want
to
change
terminology--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
of
course
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that
your
honor
is
correct
in
your
statement
of
the
end
result
that
was
not
an
element
of
the
case.
i
rather
doubt
that
no
one
knew
that
it
was
there.
i
think
it
was
there
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
thats
correct
and
i
would
think
that
it
is
proper
to
state
that
under
the
existing
law,
knowledge
of
the
condition
need
not
be
brought
home
to
the
ship
owner
in
order
to
enforce
liability
on
him
because
it
is
a
liability
without
fault.
it
is
not
the
situation
of
the
conner
grocery
whether
coca
cola
bottle
is
not
off
and
he
leaves
it
there
too
long
and
somebody
steps
on
it
and
is
cut.
if
it's
there
for
a
moment,
it
is
a
condition
whether
the
owner
knows
it
or
not,
it's
still
is
a
condition.
and
when
a
party
is
injured
by
virtue
of
that
condition,
then
there
is
liability.
but
it
is
a
condition
and
it
is
a
condition
which
precedes
the
accident,
precedes
the
injury
and
the
doctrine
presupposes
condition
rather
than
causation
and
in
fact
is
--
this
is
a
definition
i
should
think
of
unseaworthiness.
a
condition
rather
than
causation
the
fact
that
you
know
about
it
or
dont
know
about
it
is
of
no
moment
because
as
you
point
out,
it
is
a
liability
without
fault.
in
the
case
of
mascuilli
to
revert
to
it
one
more
time
if
i
may
and
then
set
digressed,
certainly,
it
is
not
an
easy
case,
easy
decision
to
understand.
and
certainly,
the
second
circuit
takes
one
view
of
the
interpretation
and
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
take
it
completely
and
irreconcilably
opposite
view
of
the
same
decision.
so
that
we
do
have
a
direct
conflict
in
the
twos
--
in
the
three
circuits.
two
on
the
one
side
and
the
one
on
the
other
with
possibly
the
third
and
the
fourth
mixing
in
some
may
say
in
favor
of
the
second
and
some
may
say
in
favor
of
the
fifth
but
certainly,
there
are
two
circuits
at
least
on
the
one
side
and
one
at
least
on
the
other
side
and
the
views
are
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
1920
i
believe.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
dating
back
even
further
than
that
but
say
to
the
oceola,
yes,
you
had
your
remedy
for
unseaworthiness
at
the
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that
--
frankly,
i
have
not.
no,
if
the
court
please
but
the
jones
act
is
presently
interpreted
as
being
an
exclusive
remedy.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it's
presently
interpreted
as
presenting
--
as
giving
an
exclusive
remedy
to
a
seaman.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
he
embraces
unseaworthiness
action
on
to
his
negligence
action
and
brings
it
both
in
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
if
the
court
please
and
i
couldnt
answer
the
question.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
think
however
that
the
sieracki
type
of
seaman
such
as
we're
dealing
with
here
would
be
covered
by
the
same
type
of
hearing
that
your
honor
is
referring
to.
because
i
think
the
hearings
insofar
as
the
jones
act
are
concerned
would
be
limited
to
seaman
as
such
to
the
man
who
work
on
board
ships
and
not
to
the
harbor
workers
who
have
been
given
seaman
rights
in
the
so
called
sieracki
seaman
who
got
their
rights
following
the
sieracki
case
rather
than
from
the
legislation
and
the
jones
act.
i
believe
that
these
cases
that
we're
getting
now
are
going
much
further
than
the
court
ever
dreamt
that
they
could
go.
in
the
fifth
circuit
at
least,
we're
getting
further
and
further
away
from
the
ship
as
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
grows
and
as
this
instantaneous
negligence
doctrine
could
grow.
if
this
case
were
to
be
decided
adversely
to
the
position
we
take,
under
the
case
law
that
is
now
coming
up,
it
would
be
possible
for
a
truck
driver
to
negligently
operate
a
truck
on
his
way
to
a
roof
(ph)
up
here
and
for
the
ship
to
become
responsible
for
his
injuries
by
reason
of
his
having
been
--
the
ship
having
become
unseaworthy.
the
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
the
fifth
circuit
right
now,
there
are
--
there
is
case
law
and
i
should
imagine
that
your
honors
will
get
these
cases
on
writs.
there
are
two
cases
decided
in
september,
the
lower
case
and
the
chagois
case
where
one;
a
man
is
discharging
a
real
car
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
the
other
one
is
the
lift
truck
driver
who
is
on
the
roof
hooking
up
to
this
lift
truck
driver
in
the
fifth
circuit
case
was
moving
some
cargo
on
the
roof
to
get
it
near
to
the
ship
and
what
they
call
headache
rack
on
top
of
the
protection,
on
top
of
the
lift
truck
on
the
roof
falls
on
his
head
held
that
he
could
recover
against
the
ship
on
the
grounds
of
unseaworthiness.
now
this
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
this
--
this
is
a
simple
extension
of
that
if
the
court
please
if
when
you're
discharging
a
car
500
feet
away
from
a
ship
and
working
with
a
tool
to
discharge
rice
from
the
car
and
you
get
hurt
discharging
the
car
and
the
court
holds
that
the
ship
is
responsible
for
your
injury
and
the
ship
didnt
furnish
that
tool
when
you're
not
employed
by
the
ship--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
was
the
chagois
case
if
the
court
please
chagois
versus
lykes
brothers--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it's
officially
reported.
it's
an
a
slip
opinion
of
course.
i
think
september
30,
either
september
16
or
september
30,
one
is
the
chagois
against
lykes
brothers
and
the
other
one
is
law
against
sagamore
hill
which
was
decided
on
december
--
september
16.
that
was
the
one
where
the
lift
truck
had
the
headache
rack
fall
on
the
man.
the
other
one
was
the
rice
worker
case
hurting
the
man.
but
these
are
the
extensions
that
you
get
too--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
not
in
this
case.
this
case
is
a
sling
attached
to
the
ship
itself
with
the
man
standing
directly
adjacent
to
the
ship
but
not
on
board
the
ship
which
i
dont
think
could
make
any
difference
although
it
might.
but
he
is
not
on
board
the
ship.
he
is
engaged
in
loading.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
clearly
a
case
of
unseaworthiness
which
would
be
actionable.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
certainly.
we
dont
complain--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
oh
yes.
i
would
think
also
that
there
would
be
very
few
people
who
would
object
to
the
concept
of
a
man
recovering
for
what
we
would
call
true
unseaworthiness.
it's
the
idea
of
bringing
the
unseaworthiness
into
play
where
the
ship
itself
is
perfectly
sound
and
someone
makes
it
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
the
ship
and
its
equipment
be
perfectly
sound.
but
in
the
state
of
the
law
as
i
understand
it
today
if
the
ship
itself
and
all
of
its
equipment
is
completely
sound,
and
a
longshoreman
goes
on
board
the
ship
and
drops
some
grease
on
the
deck
and
the
man
following
him
slips
on
that
grease,
that
ship
is
unseaworthy
and
that
man
can
sue
the
ship
for
his
injuries.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir.
because
that
of
course
happened
on
the
ship
and
that
of
course--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
accident?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
you
dont.
what
i
am
saying
though
if
the
court
please
is
that
if
you
permit
the
operational
negligence
to
substitute
for
unseaworthiness,
if
you
require
that
simple
--
if
you
permit
simple
negligence
to
be
a
substitute
for
unseaworthiness,
then
where
are
you
going
to
get?
you're
going
to
get
these
cases
stretching
further
and
further
away
from
the
ship
and
you're
going
to
be
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
[laughter
attempt]
that
of
course
is
true
but
i
submit
to
the
court
in
all
earnestness
that
there
is
no
reason
for
this
type
of
extension.
this
is
a
new
departure
from
existing
law
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
i
should
think
waldron
is
a
case
that
could
be
very
easily
decided
on
the
same
basis
as
boudoin
against
lykes
that
the
ship
can
be
unseaworthy
and
manpower
as
well
as
an
equipment
and
we've
always
recognized
that.
if
you
put
two
man
on
the
job
that
takes
four
men
to
do,
certainly,
i
should
think
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
and
that
the
two
men
are
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
think
that
the
waldron
case
held
that.
no,
if
the
court
please
i
think
you
sent
it
back
because
the
court
--
the
lower
court
had
taken
the
unseaworthiness
issue
away
from
the
jury.
but
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
but
the
negligence
matter
was
held
against
the
plaintiff
in
the
waldron
case
which
was
the
subject
to
the
dissent
that
was
in
that
case.
where
it
was
held
that
since
there
was
--
since
the
jury
had
found
there
was
no
negligence
in
assigning
two
men
to
do
the
job,
then
it
couldnt
very
well
be
unseaworthy.
the
ship
couldnt
be
unseaworthy
because
there
was
no
lack
of
manpower.
this
is
the
way
i
read
the
case.
nevertheless,
it
was
sent
back
and
it
was
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
it
was
sent
back
on
the
unseaworthiness
issue.
but
still,
it
was
a
condition
because
there
were
two
men
carrying
something
that
the
court
that
might
be
four
men
should
carry--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
true.
but
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
i
dont
think
the
waldron
case
comes
close
to
this
case
if
the
court
please
and
i
think
you
have
to
do
more
than
come
to
that
conclusion
--
come
to
the
conclusion
that
operational
negligence
is
involved
to
get
to
the
result
in
the
waldron
case.
you
dont
need
that
theory
spelled
out
that
way
to
get
to
the
answer
in
the
waldron
case.
in
waldron,
the
condition
was
there.
that
was
the
fact
that
two
men
were
doing
the
work
that
three
or
four
men
should
have
been
doing
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
at
that
moment
--
to
the
same
extent
as
if
an
improper
tool
had
been
given
to
them
to
use.
and
on
that
basis,
you
had
an
incompetent
crew
or
incompetent
--
incomplete
workforce
and
that
made
the
ship
unseaworthy.
but
it
was
a
condition
that
existed
at
the
moment
of
injury
so
i
could
justify
the
waldron
case
without
any
difficulty.
now
all
of
this
stems
i
think
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
think
there's
much
doubt
about
it
on
this
date
at
todays
law,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
dont
guess
i
would
be.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness
is
the
key
note,
i
think
in
the
touchdown
on
which
we
have
to
view
these
cases.
that
concept
we
submit
requires
there
to
be
a
condition.
and
if
you
do
not
have
a
condition,
you
cannot
have
unseaworthiness
by
definition.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
now
if
that
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it.
and
nor
with
the
fact
that
the
ship
owner
had
knowledge
or
did
not
have
knowledge
of
the
existence
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
this
doctrine
we
submit
comes
from
judge
hahns
decision
on
the
second
circuit
in
grileau.
and
in
grileau,
we
feel
that
that
judge
hahn
indicated
at
that
time
that
there
had
to
be
a
time
interval
in
order
to
apply
to
doctrine
that
he
was
speaking
for
then.
if
you
recall,
in
grileau,
there
was
a
hatch
board
cocked
over
a
(inaudible)
unequally
and
the
man
fell
on
the
hatch
board.
but
he
indicated
that
a
time
interval
had
to
elapse.
and
if
you
dont
have
your
time
interval
elapsing,
if
you
dont
have
your
condition
existing,
youve
got
something
that
isn't
unseaworthiness.
now,
i
dont
know
what
it
is
and
of
course,
the
law
can
be
changed,
but
at
this
moment,
it
isn't
unseaworthiness
as
we
know
it
and
as
the
word
is
defined
to
be
because
it
is
not
a
condition
and
you
must
have
a
condition
for
anything
to
be
unseaworthy.
additionally,
the
question
of
what
this
does
to
the
industry
when
you
put
it
together
with
ryan
is
startling
in
its
results.
the
men
who
work
on
the
ships
of
course
are
covered
by
the
compensation
act,
given
the
compensation
by
their
employers,
they
have
their
comp
awarded
to
them
as
their
sole
and
exclusive
remedy.
they
have
their
right
to
a
third
party
action
and
the
third
party
of
course
goes
back
against
the
employer
so
that
in
all
of
these
cases
that
come
to
court,
not
in
all
but
in
99%
i
should
say,
there
is
a
liability
over
charged
against
the
contract
stevedore
or
the
person
--
the
employer
of
the
injured
man.
we
are
getting
the
security
of
action
to
come
right
around
the
corner
back
to
where
the
congress
said
it
could
not
rest.
and
philosophically,
it's
our
submission
that
it
is
unfair
to
foist
upon
anyone,
a
fixed
liability
without
fault
and
yet
put
no
limits
on
that
liability
and
thats
what
this
type
of
result
comes
to.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
$100.00--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
a
hundred.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
the
question
if
you
bring
it
down
to
that
mr.
justice
black
of
how
much
is
the
public
going
to
pay
for
the
service.
because
obviously,
the
public
is
going
to
get
the
charge
passed
along
to
it
in
higher
cost
so
that
doesnt
matter
whether
it's
insured
or
not.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
there's
a
big
difference
i
should
think
between
a
judgment
for
half
a
million
dollars
and
cash
damages
and
a
judgment
for
$102
a
week
or
$122
a
week
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
our
case?
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
our
case,
we
got
a
summary
judgment
with
the
defense.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
court
please,
the
case
comes
to
you
on
the
fifth
circuits
statement
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
operational
negligence
constituting
unseaworthiness
which
would
be
actionable
by
an
injured
man.
we
seek
an
affirmance
of
that
ruling.
operational
negligence
as
such
does
not
on
the
part
of
the
contract
stevedore
does
not
give
rise
to
an
action
against
the
ship
for
unseaworthiness.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it's
the
same
thing
if
the
court
please.
instantaneous
negligence
and
operational
negligence
we
would
think
would
be
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
i
think
not
because
i
dont
think
you
have
ever
had
that
decision
unless
you
made
that
decision
in
mascuilli
or
unless
you
made
it
as
mr.
justice
black
says
you
made
it
in
waldron.
i
dont
know
that
you
have.
there
is
no
clear
cut
statement
by
this
court
that
instantaneous
negligence
constitutes
unseaworthiness
or
that
operational
negligence
constitute
unseaworthiness.
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
the
negligence
charge
was
against
the
longshoreman
apparently
if
the
court
please
and
not
against
the
ship.
the
operator
of
the
winch
who
was
the
negligent
party
was
an
employee
of
the
stevedore
and
a
fellow
employee
of
the
injured
plaintiff.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
should
think
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
should
think
that
you're
right.
he
has
no
claim
for
negligence
under
this
concept,
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct,
it's
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
he
can
maintain
a
negligence
action
against
the
ship.
yes,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
it's
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
he
is
given
something
thats
pretty
--
for
all
practical
purposes,
he
can
do
the
same
thing
that
a
seaman
can
do.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
mentions
exactly
how
far
the
occurrence
of
the
injury
was
from
the
ship
itself
but
in
the
chagois
case--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it's
well
away
yes
sir
and
in
the
law
case,
the
sagamore
hill,
they
made
no
bones
about
how
close
it
was
to
the
ship.
the
fact
was
--
the
concept
of
both
cases
was
that
he
was
preparing
cargo
for
loading
on
board
the
ship
and
therefore,
he
was
engaged
in
loading
the
ship
and
therefore,
the
ship
owed
him
a
duty
of
--
owed
him
a
seaworthy
ship
and
not
to
have
him
injured
and
therefore
grant
him
a
recovery.
this
was
the
concept
and
the
approach
that
the
court
gave
to
both
cases.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
i
shouldnt
think
so.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
but
in
this
context,
these
people
are
loading
ships
you
see
and
where
they
are
loading
ships,
you
always
think
that
they
are
right
on
the
ship
but
obviously,
this
wouldnt
apply
if
a
man
was
going
back
and
forth,
on
and
off
the
ship
carrying
cargo
on
his
shoulder,
when
he
was
carrying
it
on
to
the
ship
or
carrying
it
off
of
the
ship.
but
that
isn't
the
way
stevedoring
is
done,
they
have
a
bunch
of
men
that
are
in
the
hole
and
another
bunch
that
are
on
the
shore.
and
the
theory
now
is
that
the
men
on
shore
and
the
theory
now
is
that
the
man
on
shore
has
the
same
rights
as
the
men
on
the
ship.
the
mere
fortuitous
event
that
they
are
posted
to
shore
today
and
not
in
the
ship
today
doesnt
change
their
rights
at
all.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
