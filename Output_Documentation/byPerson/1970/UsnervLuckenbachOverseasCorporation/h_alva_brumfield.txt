mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
operational
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
renders
a
vessel
instantaneously
unseaworthy
is
devoid
of
any
problems
of
defective
equipment
on
seaworthiness
and
any
part
of
the
vessel
whatsoever.
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
filed
by
the
ship
owner
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
of
mascuilli.
if
this
circuit
court
of
appeal
reversed
a
holding
that
the
operational
negligence
as
presented
in
the
case
did
not
instantaneously
make
the
ship
unseaworthy
and
in
effect
refused
to
follow
this,
the
courts
decision
in
mascuilli.
now,
mascuilli,
the
facts
there
are
on
all
force
with
the
facts
here.
the
facts
in
usner
was
that
the
ship
was
seaworthy,
the
equipment
was,
--
it
was
the
operational
negligence
of
an
operator,
a
longshoreman
of
a
winch
that
calls
the
sling
to
come
down
too
fast
into
the
barge
and
striking
the
petitioner
and
injuring
him.
the
equipment
was
used
before
and
after
this
occurrence
without
any
trouble
whatsoever.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
with
the
facts
as
established
from
the
record
in
mascuilli,
because
the
trial
court
in
that
case
found
in
the
findings
of
fact
number
35
that
the
operational
negligence
of
the
winch
operators
in
operating
the
guide,
the
winches
that
had
detached
the
guidelines
in
such
a
manner
that
they
became
taut
and
causing
a
breakage
of
the
equipment
striking
the
mascuilli
and
killed
him.
so,
it
was
done
so
instantaneously
that
the
officer
had
no
opportunity
to
give
a
warning.
so,
the
case
is
on
all
force
and
we
submit
that
mascuilli
is
the
posture
of
the
issue
here
and
answers
the
question
very
clearly
to
us
that
operational
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
makes
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
even
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ship,
the
ship
owner
has
no
knowledge
of
it,
didnt
own
it,
had
no
control
of
it
as
was
held
in
patterson,
may
it
please
your
honor
in
the
landmark
case,
the
court
held
that
that
was
no
defense
and
that
it
made
the
ship
unseaworthy.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
and
the
ninth,
i
believe
have
been
straining
nuts
and
hairsplitting
and
attempting
to
apply
a
time
element
to
make
the
negligent
act
exist
to
such
an
extent
that
the
--
it
would
ripen
into
an
unseaworthiness
condition.
and
the
decisions
just
are
not
reconcilable
at
all.
and
we
submit
that
the
reason
that
theyve
got
themselves
on
these
horns
of
dilemma
is
because
they
failed
to
follow
fundamental
principles
and
guidelines
that
this
court
has
annunciated
over
the
years.
unseaworthiness
can
be
caused
by
no
negligence
at
all.
the
structural
defects,
unseaworthiness
can
be
caused
by
a
non
negligent
act
as
mr.
justice
black
in
walden
where
the
jury
found
that
the
order
given
by
the
mate
to
move
the
rope
by
two
instead
of
three
or
four
seaman
was
not
negligent
yet
this
case
held
that
the
question
of
unseaworthiness
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
even
though
the
jury
had
found
that
that
act
itself
was
not
negligent.
unseaworthiness
can
be
caused
by
negligent
acts
and
unseaworthiness
can
be
called
by
negligent
acts
which
occur
at
the
same
time
and
make
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
now,
this
court
has
never,
never
required
that
there
be
a
showing
that
time
must
elapse
from
the
negligent
act
until
the
occurrence
of
the
unseaworthiness.
this
court
has
never
done
that.
in
mahnich,
this
court
held
that
the
act
of
the
seaman
in
choosing
the
rotten
rope
instead
of
the
good
rope
created
unseaworthiness.
in
crumady,
mr.
justice
douglas
held
that
the
act
of
setting
the
electrical
cutoff
device
incorrectly
created
unseaworthiness.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
on
--
mahnich
was
a
seaman,
crumady
was
a
longshoreman
both
on
ship
but
in
gutierrez,
mr.
justice
white,
it
occurred
on
the
dock
where
the
beans
spilled
out
of
defective
containers
holding
that
that
caused
unseaworthiness
to
the
ship.
so
this
court
has
never,
never
required
this
so
called
lapse
of
time
to
ripen
an
act
of
negligence
into
unseaworthiness.
because
somewhere
down
the
line,
usually
you
are
going
to
find
some
act
of
negligence
that
started
in
motion
to
make
the
ship
unseaworthy
and
this
court
has
held
that
theres
no
distinction
between
the
acts
of
the
equipment
itself
being
defective
for
example
and
the
acts
of
personnel
or
the
seaman
or
the
longshoreman
or
the
workers
aboard.
that
was
clearly
pointed
out
in
board
one
and
in
walden
itself
and
at
the
moment
that
a
piece
of
equipment
or
pertinence
of
the
ship
itself,
became
defective.
it
was
at
that
very
moment
that
the
ship
became
unseaworthy
and
the
same
is
true
by
the
act
of
a
defective
seaman
or
a
defective
worker
performing
a
negligent
act.
the
minute
he
does
that
that
makes
the
--
and
it
causes
injury,
that
makes
the
ship
unseaworthy.
and
we
submit,
may
it
please
your
honor
that
in
mascuilli,
when
the
question
was
posed
as
to
whether
or
not
because
in
mahnich
and
in
crumady
and
gutierrez,
the
question
as
to
the
time
lapse
wasnt
even
considered.
but
in
mascuilli,
you
had
it
before
you
exactly
that
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
operation
by
the
winch
negligently
making
the
guidelines
come
top
and
breaking,
cause
an
injury
instantaneously
without
the
affording
of
the
officer
or
any
one
giving
--
having
opportunity
giving
a
warning,
you
held
in
no
uncertain
occurrence,
may
it
please
your
honor
that
that
was
unseaworthiness
and
that
liability
of
the
ship
owner
was
established.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
true.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no,
i
dont
believe
it
does
may
it
please
your
honor
because
this
court
has
outlined
various
guidelines
to
make
those
determinations
because
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
but
may
it
please
your
honor,
insofar
as
the
stevedores
are
longshoremans,
it
is
--
it
is
known
and
can
be
taken
as
a
fact
that
the
sieracki
seaman
or
the
people
or
the
workers
in
that
place
are
doing
now
work
that
was
traditionally
done
before
by
the
seaman.
and
that
work
has
become
more
dangerous
--
using
more
dangerous
and
hazardous
equipment.
and
so
it
gives
rise
to
this
court
extending
the
maritime
law
to
these
type
of
workers.
and
insofar
as
the
triad
of
going
back
in
indemnity
against
stevedore,
laid
down
various
lines
there
that
where
the
unsafe
place
to
work,
where
this
duty
was
violated
in
that
respect,
then
of
course
there
would
be
indemnity
over
from
the
stevedore
to
the
ship
owner.
and
so
that
in
itself
is
not
a
--
shouldnt
be
a
determinant.
it
has
not
been
because
of
the
principles
of
--
that
have
been
annunciated
by
this
court
that
this
duty
of
warranty
of
furnishing
a
ship
reasonably
safe
for
the
intended
purpose
and
furnishing
a
place
safe
to
work
has
been
founded
in
the
law
annunciated
by
this
court
down
through
the
years.
and
we
can
see
nothing
insofar
as
that
problem
goes
that
would
cause
a
tying
up
of
not
only
pages
of
jurisprudence
of
this
court
but
sir
i
would
say
volumes.
and
in
this
condition
of
unseaworthiness
can
be
transitory
but
it's
a
temporary
condition.
back
in
this
case,
well,
the
mitchell
case
with
mr.
justice
stewart
where
the
1221
on
the
rail.
here,
you
had
--
instead
of
that,
you
had
longshoreman
creating
this
transitory,
temporary
condition
by
his
negligent
act.
and
i
know
that
we
speak
of
unseaworthiness,
it
connotes
a
condition
and
we
speak
of
negligent,
it
connotes
causation.
but
just
because
that
the
twain
is
met
and
just
because
you
have
causation
and
negligence
occurring
at
the
same
time,
nonetheless
you
have
unseaworthiness
and
thats
exactly
what
this
court
has
adhered
to
all
the
way
and
it
is
not
the
--
it's
not
so
much
as
the
manner
in
which
the
condition
of
unseaworthiness
took
place
but
the
fact
that
it
did,
it's
a
species
of
liability
without
fault
is
really
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
it
does.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
thats
exactly
right,
may
it
please
your
honor.
and
you
so
held
in
walden
because
the
jury
in
that
case
held
with
the
very
act
of
the
mate
giving
the
order
was
not
negligence.
and
yet
this
court
reversed
to
send
it
back
to
submit
the
unseaworthiness
pressful
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
that
it
didnt
take
any
negligence
at
all
to
make
an
unseaworthiness
condition.
but
just
because
you
got
operational
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
that
still
doesnt
make
it
not
unseaworthiness,
thats
how
simple
it
is
to
me
that
for
the
life,
i
cannot
understand
why
the
courts
--
and
i
know
that
some
of
the
court
say
that
if
particularly,
you
criticize
mascuilli
by
saying
it's
not
illuminating
and
it's
cryptic
and
by
saying
that
you
didnt
procure
and
you
used
the
--
i
believe
you
used
exactly
14
words
in
that
decision.
and
you
said
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
granted
and
the
judgment
is
reversed.
but
it
couldnt
be
anything
any
clearer
than
that
to
me
because
what
was
presented
to
you
as
a
matter
of
law
is
where
the
instantaneous
negligence
made
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
maybe
it
does,
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
were
stating
prior
to
lunch,
this
court
has
rendered
many
landmark
decisions
in
so
called
cryptic
terms
of
just
a
few
words.
and
one
case
comes
to
mind
and
thats
the
petterson
case
where
your
honors
held
that
snatch
block
were
brought
ashore
by
stevedore
and
company
and
not
owned
by
the
ship
owner.
the
ship
owner
had
no
knowledge
of
it.
it
was
defective
and
held
that
that
in
itself
caused
a
ship
to
be
unseaworthy
and
you
did
that
in
exactly
four
words.
you
said
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
another
landmark
case
especially
down
in
our
section
of
the
country,
the
1636
case
where
you
had
under
consideration
the
review
of
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
decision
involving
whether
or
not
workman
onboard,
a
submergible
drilling
barge
in
his
drilling
operation
offshore.
first
of
all
was
the
seaman
and
second
of
all
was
the
submersible
drilling
barge,
a
vessel.
and
you
did
that
i
think
in
25
words
by
saying
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
the
direction
to
reinstate
the
judgment.
and
so,
it
maybe
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
a
rebellion
but
then
nonetheless,
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
in
many
of
the
landmark
decisions
mahnich,
crumady,
waldron,
mitchell,
gutierrez,
all
of
them
had
adhered
to
the
same
principle
of
the
humanitarian
doctrine
of
species
of
liability
without
fault.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
the
crumady
was
in
1944.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
mean
mahnich
was
1944.
and
never
in
all
of
these
occasions
that
you
had
to
reveal
this
question.
did
you
require
any
time
lapsing
or
that
this
condition
had
to
develop
over
a
period
of
time
from
the
active
negligence
to
the
entry?
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no
your
honor,
they
havent
passed
any
legislation
concerning
this
problems
since
then.
no
sir.
and
so
we
say
that
in
answer
to
chief
judge
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit
when
he
said
in
talking
about
mascuilli.
of
course,
nothing
we
say
about
what
the
supreme
court
said
or
thought
it
said
can
add
much
if
what
was
said
or
what
it
will
say
it
said.
how
we
have
the
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
he
was
on
the
panel
that
decided
the
grigsby
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
they
held
that
operational
negligence
was
brought
about
unseaworthy
condition
but
it
wasn't
instantaneous.
it
was
over
a
lapse
of
time
and
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
burger
was
on
the
panel
of
that
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
all
together
but
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
true.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
right.
may
it
please
your
honor
but
chief
justice
bryan
writing
the
opinion
made
the
statement
about
mascuilli
and
it
didnt
make
the
same
statement
other
than
holding
the
different
panel.
in
usner
held
of
that
reverse
to
district
court
holding
that
the
operational
negligence
didnt
make
the
ship
unseaworthy
instantaneously.
and
the
only
reason
that
ill
make
that
statement
is
that
we
feel
that
this
court
in
mascuilli
has
answered
the
very
issue
that
has
been
--
is
being
presented
here
and
in
no
uncertain
terms
because
you
reversed
a
finding
of
the
district
court
and
the
second
court
of
appeal
decision
based
upon
facts
which
were
finding
of
facts
and
as
a
question
of
law
that
was
presented
that
an
instantaneous
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
made
the
ship
unseaworthy
or
in
other
words,
there
is
--
just
because
you
have
an
operation
on
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
that
in
itself
doesnt
take
away
the
fact
that
you
have
unseaworthiness.
because
as
i've
pointed
out
many
times
in
the
waldron
case
and
others,
you
dont
need
negligence
at
all
to
find
that
there
was
an
unseaworthy
condition
in
the
vessel.
and
so--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
sir.
crumady
and
mahnich.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
i
do,
may
it
please
your
honor
because
in
both
of
those
cases,
mahnich
and
in
crumady,
it
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
operational
negligence
created
the
unseaworthy
condition.
in
mahnich,
the
getting
or
choosing
the
rope
which
was
rotten
was
a
negligent
act
that
created
the
unseaworthiness.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
you
did
but
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
right,
may
it
please
your
honor
but
we
dont
need
a
defective
piece
of
equipment
to
make
a
ship
unseaworthy.
this
court
has
held
that
mr.
justice
black
in
waldron
and
many
other
decision
of
(inaudible)
seaman
--
a
man
can
make
a
ship
unseaworthy
is
just
the
same
as
a
defective
piece
of
equipment.
and
just
because
you
have
the
operation
of
the
human
element,
the
personnel
has
well
pointed
out
in
waldron,
there's
no
distinction
between
the
ships
equipment
and
the
personnel
aboard.
both
can
bring
about
an
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well,
what
i
say
in
those
cases,
crumady
and
in
mahnich,
this
court
didnt
concern
itself
with
going
in
to
the
fact
or
determining
what
lapse
of
time
was
necessary
for
the
choosing
of
the
rotten
rope
or
for
the
missetting
of
the
electrical
cutoff
device
to
make
it
unseaworthy.
you
never
have
done
that.
and
so
here,
you
have
the
situation
of
where
the
operational
negligence
occurred
at
the
same
time
of
the
injury,
nonetheless,
you
have
unseaworthy
condition.
there's
no
need
for
the
lapse
of
time
to
make
this
act
of
negligence
gel
in
to
ripen
into
an
unseaworthy
condition.
and
so
we
say
that
the
crumady
and
mahnich
do
support
mascuilli.
and
mascuilli
had
before
the
very
question
of
instantaneous
negligence
that
we
held
here
as
whether
or
not
the
act
of
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
made
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
or
to
say
it
in
other
words,
just
because
you
had
an
operational
negligence
that
brought
about
this
condition,
that
in
itself
doesnt
take
away
from
the
fact
that
the
ship
was
unseaworthy.
and
so
we
say
may
it
please
your
honor
that
this
court
could
be
cryptic
if
it
wishes
and
decide
this
case
in
four
words.
and
those
four
words,
the
judgment
is
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
your
honors,
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
marshall
to
the
dropping
of
the
grease,
if
the
grease
is
dropped
without
any
negligence
whatsoever
and
a
seaman
or
another
stevedore
steps
on
it,
my
good
friend
says
thats
unseaworthy
condition
which
i
agree.
and
by
the
same
token,
if
that
grease
was
dropped
on
the
seaman
or
worker
himself
and
say
hit
him
in
the
eye
and
put
his
eye
off.
nonetheless
he
had
held
the
unseaworthy
condition.
and
this
theory
that
i
think
generated
from
the
fifth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
there
must
be
some
time
element
in
order
for
this
negligent
act
or
none
negligent
act
to
ripen
into
unseaworthy
condition
is
just
fiction
and
has
no
basis
on
any
decision
of
this
court.
and
just
because
you
have
to
condition
and
the
causation
occurring
at
the
same
time
or
seconds
apart
is
the
condition
itself
thats
important.
the
unsafe
place
to
work
that
is
violated.
and
if
thats
done
by
a
matter
of
seconds
or
matter
of
hours
or
a
matter
of
days,
it
wouldnt
make
any
difference
if
this
sling
itself
as
your
honor
said
drops
the
grease.
so
if
the
sling
itself
when
it
was
negligently
dropped
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
may
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
right.
but
the
man
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
say
that
the
man
--
there
is
no
difference
and
this
court
has
said
so
in
no
uncertain
terms
in
the
waldron
case,
it
makes
no
difference
between
the
equipment
and
the
personnel
because
this
condition
can
be
brought
about
by
a
defective
equipment
or
negligent
operation
of
the
equipment
or
even
by
non
negligent
operation
of
the
equipment.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
makes
no
difference
may
it
please
your
honor
because
this
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
sir,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well,
your
honor,
you
didnt
even
make
that
determination.
you
said
it
was
there.
it
was
transitory.
it
was
temporary.
it
was
on
the
rail
and
he
stepped
on
it.
now,
if
it
had
been
there
hours,
if
it
had
been
there
days,
i
dont
--
ill
say
it
would
make
absolutely
no
difference
whatsoever
because
a
condition,
it
didnt
have
--
it
didnt
have
to
be
there
for
a
matter
of
hours
before
the
sailor
stepped
on
the
rail
and
he
was
thrown
overboard,
he
couldve
been
there
a
second
before
he
stepped
on
that
rail.
and
this
so
called
condition,
of
course
it's
a
unseaworthy
condition
but
--
and
it's
preceded
by
some
negligence,
but
that
can
occur
just
seconds
before
or
the
same
time.
there
has
to
be
some
and
usually
are
some
negligent
acts
it
creates
a
condition.
of
course,
we
agree
with
that
but
just
because
you
have
an
operational
negligence,
that
does
not
take
away
from
the
fact
that
that
operational
negligence
instantaneously
creates
an
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
when
the
(inaudible)
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
we
cite
them
in
our
briefs.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
(inaudible).
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
sure
dont
mr.
justice
black
but
they
concern
themselves
with
a
lapse
of
time
whereas
nowhere
in
this
court
in
this
decision
at
crumady
and
gutierrez
where
it
happened
offshore
or
with
a
bean
bags
or
the
man,
those
cases,
nowhere
when
this
question
of
negligence
or
non-negligence
creating
a
condition
of
unseaworthiness
was
the
time
ever
considered.
now
you
did
squarely
hold
that
an
instantaneous
operational
negligence
created
unseaworthy
condition.
and
you
held
it
just
as
clearly
as
anything
as
any
decision
youve
ever
pronounced
from
this
court.
because
the
lower
court
found
a
finding
of
fact,
number
35
that
says
that
the
operational
negligence
occurred,
the
equipment
was
seaworthy
and
it
occurred
so
instantaneously
that
the
officer
couldnt
warn
--
give
him
a
warning
whatsoever.
it
occurred
then.
and
now
the
court
denied
a
liability.
and
your
honors
reversed
it.
well
if
thats
saying
that
instantaneous
operational
negligence
makes
a
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy
and
thats
how
clear
that
decision
is.
and
it
makes
that
you
dont
have
to
have
this
lapse
of
time,
when
you
say
it
must
precede
the
grease
dropping
and
stepping
back
on
or
someone
steeping
momentarily
thereafter
on
the
grease.
but
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
was
there
in
a
matter
of
time.
the
condition
is
a
unsafe
place
to
work
and
if
thats
created
by
a
negligent
act,
is
unseaworthy.
and
just
because
it
occurred
seconds
before
or
just
because
it
--
momentarily
at
the
same
time,
you
have
a
causation
and
condition
meeting
at
the
same
time
is
unseaworthy.
and
thats
what
your
honors
have
held.
you
held
it
in
mascuilli,
you
did
have
the
same
question
before
this
and
thats
what
you
did
hold
in
absolutely
no
uncertain
terms.
and
we
submit
may
it
please
your
honor
that
thats
the
policy
of
that
mascuilli
decision
in
line
with
the
other
decisions
of
crumady
and
mahnich
or
justification
and
authority
if
you
need
in
making
pronouncements
which
you
certainly
held
that
in
mascuilli.
and
there's
just
absolutely
no
question
about
it.
and
as
i
say,
here
where
you
have
the
--
a
defective
equipment
may
it
please
your
honor
to
say
it
one
more
time,
momentarily
can
create
a
ship
unseaworthy
or
any
kind
of
transitory
condition
can
momentarily
make
that
ship
unseaworthy.
or
active
men
--
there's
no
distinction
between
the
equipment
and
the
personnel.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
that
in
itself
can
make
it
unseaworthy.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
operational
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
renders
a
vessel
instantaneously
unseaworthy
is
devoid
of
any
problems
of
defective
equipment
on
seaworthiness
and
any
part
of
the
vessel
whatsoever.
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
filed
by
the
ship
owner
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
of
mascuilli.
if
this
circuit
court
of
appeal
reversed
a
holding
that
the
operational
negligence
as
presented
in
the
case
did
not
instantaneously
make
the
ship
unseaworthy
and
in
effect
refused
to
follow
this,
the
courts
decision
in
mascuilli.
now,
mascuilli,
the
facts
there
are
on
all
force
with
the
facts
here.
the
facts
in
usner
was
that
the
ship
was
seaworthy,
the
equipment
was,
--
it
was
the
operational
negligence
of
an
operator,
a
longshoreman
of
a
winch
that
calls
the
sling
to
come
down
too
fast
into
the
barge
and
striking
the
petitioner
and
injuring
him.
the
equipment
was
used
before
and
after
this
occurrence
without
any
trouble
whatsoever.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
with
the
facts
as
established
from
the
record
in
mascuilli,
because
the
trial
court
in
that
case
found
in
the
findings
of
fact
number
35
that
the
operational
negligence
of
the
winch
operators
in
operating
the
guide,
the
winches
that
had
detached
the
guidelines
in
such
a
manner
that
they
became
taut
and
causing
a
breakage
of
the
equipment
striking
the
mascuilli
and
killed
him.
so,
it
was
done
so
instantaneously
that
the
officer
had
no
opportunity
to
give
a
warning.
so,
the
case
is
on
all
force
and
we
submit
that
mascuilli
is
the
posture
of
the
issue
here
and
answers
the
question
very
clearly
to
us
that
operational
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
makes
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
even
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ship,
the
ship
owner
has
no
knowledge
of
it,
didnt
own
it,
had
no
control
of
it
as
was
held
in
patterson,
may
it
please
your
honor
in
the
landmark
case,
the
court
held
that
that
was
no
defense
and
that
it
made
the
ship
unseaworthy.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
and
the
ninth,
i
believe
have
been
straining
nuts
and
hairsplitting
and
attempting
to
apply
a
time
element
to
make
the
negligent
act
exist
to
such
an
extent
that
the
--
it
would
ripen
into
an
unseaworthiness
condition.
and
the
decisions
just
are
not
reconcilable
at
all.
and
we
submit
that
the
reason
that
theyve
got
themselves
on
these
horns
of
dilemma
is
because
they
failed
to
follow
fundamental
principles
and
guidelines
that
this
court
has
annunciated
over
the
years.
unseaworthiness
can
be
caused
by
no
negligence
at
all.
the
structural
defects,
unseaworthiness
can
be
caused
by
a
non
negligent
act
as
mr.
justice
black
in
walden
where
the
jury
found
that
the
order
given
by
the
mate
to
move
the
rope
by
two
instead
of
three
or
four
seaman
was
not
negligent
yet
this
case
held
that
the
question
of
unseaworthiness
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
even
though
the
jury
had
found
that
that
act
itself
was
not
negligent.
unseaworthiness
can
be
caused
by
negligent
acts
and
unseaworthiness
can
be
called
by
negligent
acts
which
occur
at
the
same
time
and
make
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
now,
this
court
has
never,
never
required
that
there
be
a
showing
that
time
must
elapse
from
the
negligent
act
until
the
occurrence
of
the
unseaworthiness.
this
court
has
never
done
that.
in
mahnich,
this
court
held
that
the
act
of
the
seaman
in
choosing
the
rotten
rope
instead
of
the
good
rope
created
unseaworthiness.
in
crumady,
mr.
justice
douglas
held
that
the
act
of
setting
the
electrical
cutoff
device
incorrectly
created
unseaworthiness.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
on
--
mahnich
was
a
seaman,
crumady
was
a
longshoreman
both
on
ship
but
in
gutierrez,
mr.
justice
white,
it
occurred
on
the
dock
where
the
beans
spilled
out
of
defective
containers
holding
that
that
caused
unseaworthiness
to
the
ship.
so
this
court
has
never,
never
required
this
so
called
lapse
of
time
to
ripen
an
act
of
negligence
into
unseaworthiness.
because
somewhere
down
the
line,
usually
you
are
going
to
find
some
act
of
negligence
that
started
in
motion
to
make
the
ship
unseaworthy
and
this
court
has
held
that
theres
no
distinction
between
the
acts
of
the
equipment
itself
being
defective
for
example
and
the
acts
of
personnel
or
the
seaman
or
the
longshoreman
or
the
workers
aboard.
that
was
clearly
pointed
out
in
board
one
and
in
walden
itself
and
at
the
moment
that
a
piece
of
equipment
or
pertinence
of
the
ship
itself,
became
defective.
it
was
at
that
very
moment
that
the
ship
became
unseaworthy
and
the
same
is
true
by
the
act
of
a
defective
seaman
or
a
defective
worker
performing
a
negligent
act.
the
minute
he
does
that
that
makes
the
--
and
it
causes
injury,
that
makes
the
ship
unseaworthy.
and
we
submit,
may
it
please
your
honor
that
in
mascuilli,
when
the
question
was
posed
as
to
whether
or
not
because
in
mahnich
and
in
crumady
and
gutierrez,
the
question
as
to
the
time
lapse
wasnt
even
considered.
but
in
mascuilli,
you
had
it
before
you
exactly
that
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
operation
by
the
winch
negligently
making
the
guidelines
come
top
and
breaking,
cause
an
injury
instantaneously
without
the
affording
of
the
officer
or
any
one
giving
--
having
opportunity
giving
a
warning,
you
held
in
no
uncertain
occurrence,
may
it
please
your
honor
that
that
was
unseaworthiness
and
that
liability
of
the
ship
owner
was
established.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
true.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no,
i
dont
believe
it
does
may
it
please
your
honor
because
this
court
has
outlined
various
guidelines
to
make
those
determinations
because
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
but
may
it
please
your
honor,
insofar
as
the
stevedores
are
longshoremans,
it
is
--
it
is
known
and
can
be
taken
as
a
fact
that
the
sieracki
seaman
or
the
people
or
the
workers
in
that
place
are
doing
now
work
that
was
traditionally
done
before
by
the
seaman.
and
that
work
has
become
more
dangerous
--
using
more
dangerous
and
hazardous
equipment.
and
so
it
gives
rise
to
this
court
extending
the
maritime
law
to
these
type
of
workers.
and
insofar
as
the
triad
of
going
back
in
indemnity
against
stevedore,
laid
down
various
lines
there
that
where
the
unsafe
place
to
work,
where
this
duty
was
violated
in
that
respect,
then
of
course
there
would
be
indemnity
over
from
the
stevedore
to
the
ship
owner.
and
so
that
in
itself
is
not
a
--
shouldnt
be
a
determinant.
it
has
not
been
because
of
the
principles
of
--
that
have
been
annunciated
by
this
court
that
this
duty
of
warranty
of
furnishing
a
ship
reasonably
safe
for
the
intended
purpose
and
furnishing
a
place
safe
to
work
has
been
founded
in
the
law
annunciated
by
this
court
down
through
the
years.
and
we
can
see
nothing
insofar
as
that
problem
goes
that
would
cause
a
tying
up
of
not
only
pages
of
jurisprudence
of
this
court
but
sir
i
would
say
volumes.
and
in
this
condition
of
unseaworthiness
can
be
transitory
but
it's
a
temporary
condition.
back
in
this
case,
well,
the
mitchell
case
with
mr.
justice
stewart
where
the
1221
on
the
rail.
here,
you
had
--
instead
of
that,
you
had
longshoreman
creating
this
transitory,
temporary
condition
by
his
negligent
act.
and
i
know
that
we
speak
of
unseaworthiness,
it
connotes
a
condition
and
we
speak
of
negligent,
it
connotes
causation.
but
just
because
that
the
twain
is
met
and
just
because
you
have
causation
and
negligence
occurring
at
the
same
time,
nonetheless
you
have
unseaworthiness
and
thats
exactly
what
this
court
has
adhered
to
all
the
way
and
it
is
not
the
--
it's
not
so
much
as
the
manner
in
which
the
condition
of
unseaworthiness
took
place
but
the
fact
that
it
did,
it's
a
species
of
liability
without
fault
is
really
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
it
does.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
thats
exactly
right,
may
it
please
your
honor.
and
you
so
held
in
walden
because
the
jury
in
that
case
held
with
the
very
act
of
the
mate
giving
the
order
was
not
negligence.
and
yet
this
court
reversed
to
send
it
back
to
submit
the
unseaworthiness
pressful
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
that
it
didnt
take
any
negligence
at
all
to
make
an
unseaworthiness
condition.
but
just
because
you
got
operational
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
that
still
doesnt
make
it
not
unseaworthiness,
thats
how
simple
it
is
to
me
that
for
the
life,
i
cannot
understand
why
the
courts
--
and
i
know
that
some
of
the
court
say
that
if
particularly,
you
criticize
mascuilli
by
saying
it's
not
illuminating
and
it's
cryptic
and
by
saying
that
you
didnt
procure
and
you
used
the
--
i
believe
you
used
exactly
14
words
in
that
decision.
and
you
said
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
granted
and
the
judgment
is
reversed.
but
it
couldnt
be
anything
any
clearer
than
that
to
me
because
what
was
presented
to
you
as
a
matter
of
law
is
where
the
instantaneous
negligence
made
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
maybe
it
does,
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
were
stating
prior
to
lunch,
this
court
has
rendered
many
landmark
decisions
in
so
called
cryptic
terms
of
just
a
few
words.
and
one
case
comes
to
mind
and
thats
the
petterson
case
where
your
honors
held
that
snatch
block
were
brought
ashore
by
stevedore
and
company
and
not
owned
by
the
ship
owner.
the
ship
owner
had
no
knowledge
of
it.
it
was
defective
and
held
that
that
in
itself
caused
a
ship
to
be
unseaworthy
and
you
did
that
in
exactly
four
words.
you
said
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
another
landmark
case
especially
down
in
our
section
of
the
country,
the
1636
case
where
you
had
under
consideration
the
review
of
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
decision
involving
whether
or
not
workman
onboard,
a
submergible
drilling
barge
in
his
drilling
operation
offshore.
first
of
all
was
the
seaman
and
second
of
all
was
the
submersible
drilling
barge,
a
vessel.
and
you
did
that
i
think
in
25
words
by
saying
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
the
direction
to
reinstate
the
judgment.
and
so,
it
maybe
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
a
rebellion
but
then
nonetheless,
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
in
many
of
the
landmark
decisions
mahnich,
crumady,
waldron,
mitchell,
gutierrez,
all
of
them
had
adhered
to
the
same
principle
of
the
humanitarian
doctrine
of
species
of
liability
without
fault.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
the
crumady
was
in
1944.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
mean
mahnich
was
1944.
and
never
in
all
of
these
occasions
that
you
had
to
reveal
this
question.
did
you
require
any
time
lapsing
or
that
this
condition
had
to
develop
over
a
period
of
time
from
the
active
negligence
to
the
entry?
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no
your
honor,
they
havent
passed
any
legislation
concerning
this
problems
since
then.
no
sir.
and
so
we
say
that
in
answer
to
chief
judge
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit
when
he
said
in
talking
about
mascuilli.
of
course,
nothing
we
say
about
what
the
supreme
court
said
or
thought
it
said
can
add
much
if
what
was
said
or
what
it
will
say
it
said.
how
we
have
the
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
he
was
on
the
panel
that
decided
the
grigsby
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
they
held
that
operational
negligence
was
brought
about
unseaworthy
condition
but
it
wasn't
instantaneous.
it
was
over
a
lapse
of
time
and
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
burger
was
on
the
panel
of
that
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
all
together
but
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
true.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
right.
may
it
please
your
honor
but
chief
justice
bryan
writing
the
opinion
made
the
statement
about
mascuilli
and
it
didnt
make
the
same
statement
other
than
holding
the
different
panel.
in
usner
held
of
that
reverse
to
district
court
holding
that
the
operational
negligence
didnt
make
the
ship
unseaworthy
instantaneously.
and
the
only
reason
that
ill
make
that
statement
is
that
we
feel
that
this
court
in
mascuilli
has
answered
the
very
issue
that
has
been
--
is
being
presented
here
and
in
no
uncertain
terms
because
you
reversed
a
finding
of
the
district
court
and
the
second
court
of
appeal
decision
based
upon
facts
which
were
finding
of
facts
and
as
a
question
of
law
that
was
presented
that
an
instantaneous
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
made
the
ship
unseaworthy
or
in
other
words,
there
is
--
just
because
you
have
an
operation
on
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
that
in
itself
doesnt
take
away
the
fact
that
you
have
unseaworthiness.
because
as
i've
pointed
out
many
times
in
the
waldron
case
and
others,
you
dont
need
negligence
at
all
to
find
that
there
was
an
unseaworthy
condition
in
the
vessel.
and
so--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
sir.
crumady
and
mahnich.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
i
do,
may
it
please
your
honor
because
in
both
of
those
cases,
mahnich
and
in
crumady,
it
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
operational
negligence
created
the
unseaworthy
condition.
in
mahnich,
the
getting
or
choosing
the
rope
which
was
rotten
was
a
negligent
act
that
created
the
unseaworthiness.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
you
did
but
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
right,
may
it
please
your
honor
but
we
dont
need
a
defective
piece
of
equipment
to
make
a
ship
unseaworthy.
this
court
has
held
that
mr.
justice
black
in
waldron
and
many
other
decision
of
(inaudible)
seaman
--
a
man
can
make
a
ship
unseaworthy
is
just
the
same
as
a
defective
piece
of
equipment.
and
just
because
you
have
the
operation
of
the
human
element,
the
personnel
has
well
pointed
out
in
waldron,
there's
no
distinction
between
the
ships
equipment
and
the
personnel
aboard.
both
can
bring
about
an
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well,
what
i
say
in
those
cases,
crumady
and
in
mahnich,
this
court
didnt
concern
itself
with
going
in
to
the
fact
or
determining
what
lapse
of
time
was
necessary
for
the
choosing
of
the
rotten
rope
or
for
the
missetting
of
the
electrical
cutoff
device
to
make
it
unseaworthy.
you
never
have
done
that.
and
so
here,
you
have
the
situation
of
where
the
operational
negligence
occurred
at
the
same
time
of
the
injury,
nonetheless,
you
have
unseaworthy
condition.
there's
no
need
for
the
lapse
of
time
to
make
this
act
of
negligence
gel
in
to
ripen
into
an
unseaworthy
condition.
and
so
we
say
that
the
crumady
and
mahnich
do
support
mascuilli.
and
mascuilli
had
before
the
very
question
of
instantaneous
negligence
that
we
held
here
as
whether
or
not
the
act
of
negligence
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
injury
made
the
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy.
or
to
say
it
in
other
words,
just
because
you
had
an
operational
negligence
that
brought
about
this
condition,
that
in
itself
doesnt
take
away
from
the
fact
that
the
ship
was
unseaworthy.
and
so
we
say
may
it
please
your
honor
that
this
court
could
be
cryptic
if
it
wishes
and
decide
this
case
in
four
words.
and
those
four
words,
the
judgment
is
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
your
honors,
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
marshall
to
the
dropping
of
the
grease,
if
the
grease
is
dropped
without
any
negligence
whatsoever
and
a
seaman
or
another
stevedore
steps
on
it,
my
good
friend
says
thats
unseaworthy
condition
which
i
agree.
and
by
the
same
token,
if
that
grease
was
dropped
on
the
seaman
or
worker
himself
and
say
hit
him
in
the
eye
and
put
his
eye
off.
nonetheless
he
had
held
the
unseaworthy
condition.
and
this
theory
that
i
think
generated
from
the
fifth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
there
must
be
some
time
element
in
order
for
this
negligent
act
or
none
negligent
act
to
ripen
into
unseaworthy
condition
is
just
fiction
and
has
no
basis
on
any
decision
of
this
court.
and
just
because
you
have
to
condition
and
the
causation
occurring
at
the
same
time
or
seconds
apart
is
the
condition
itself
thats
important.
the
unsafe
place
to
work
that
is
violated.
and
if
thats
done
by
a
matter
of
seconds
or
matter
of
hours
or
a
matter
of
days,
it
wouldnt
make
any
difference
if
this
sling
itself
as
your
honor
said
drops
the
grease.
so
if
the
sling
itself
when
it
was
negligently
dropped
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
may
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
right.
but
the
man
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
say
that
the
man
--
there
is
no
difference
and
this
court
has
said
so
in
no
uncertain
terms
in
the
waldron
case,
it
makes
no
difference
between
the
equipment
and
the
personnel
because
this
condition
can
be
brought
about
by
a
defective
equipment
or
negligent
operation
of
the
equipment
or
even
by
non
negligent
operation
of
the
equipment.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
makes
no
difference
may
it
please
your
honor
because
this
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
sir,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well,
your
honor,
you
didnt
even
make
that
determination.
you
said
it
was
there.
it
was
transitory.
it
was
temporary.
it
was
on
the
rail
and
he
stepped
on
it.
now,
if
it
had
been
there
hours,
if
it
had
been
there
days,
i
dont
--
ill
say
it
would
make
absolutely
no
difference
whatsoever
because
a
condition,
it
didnt
have
--
it
didnt
have
to
be
there
for
a
matter
of
hours
before
the
sailor
stepped
on
the
rail
and
he
was
thrown
overboard,
he
couldve
been
there
a
second
before
he
stepped
on
that
rail.
and
this
so
called
condition,
of
course
it's
a
unseaworthy
condition
but
--
and
it's
preceded
by
some
negligence,
but
that
can
occur
just
seconds
before
or
the
same
time.
there
has
to
be
some
and
usually
are
some
negligent
acts
it
creates
a
condition.
of
course,
we
agree
with
that
but
just
because
you
have
an
operational
negligence,
that
does
not
take
away
from
the
fact
that
that
operational
negligence
instantaneously
creates
an
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
when
the
(inaudible)
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
we
cite
them
in
our
briefs.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
(inaudible).
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
sure
dont
mr.
justice
black
but
they
concern
themselves
with
a
lapse
of
time
whereas
nowhere
in
this
court
in
this
decision
at
crumady
and
gutierrez
where
it
happened
offshore
or
with
a
bean
bags
or
the
man,
those
cases,
nowhere
when
this
question
of
negligence
or
non-negligence
creating
a
condition
of
unseaworthiness
was
the
time
ever
considered.
now
you
did
squarely
hold
that
an
instantaneous
operational
negligence
created
unseaworthy
condition.
and
you
held
it
just
as
clearly
as
anything
as
any
decision
youve
ever
pronounced
from
this
court.
because
the
lower
court
found
a
finding
of
fact,
number
35
that
says
that
the
operational
negligence
occurred,
the
equipment
was
seaworthy
and
it
occurred
so
instantaneously
that
the
officer
couldnt
warn
--
give
him
a
warning
whatsoever.
it
occurred
then.
and
now
the
court
denied
a
liability.
and
your
honors
reversed
it.
well
if
thats
saying
that
instantaneous
operational
negligence
makes
a
ship
instantaneously
unseaworthy
and
thats
how
clear
that
decision
is.
and
it
makes
that
you
dont
have
to
have
this
lapse
of
time,
when
you
say
it
must
precede
the
grease
dropping
and
stepping
back
on
or
someone
steeping
momentarily
thereafter
on
the
grease.
but
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
was
there
in
a
matter
of
time.
the
condition
is
a
unsafe
place
to
work
and
if
thats
created
by
a
negligent
act,
is
unseaworthy.
and
just
because
it
occurred
seconds
before
or
just
because
it
--
momentarily
at
the
same
time,
you
have
a
causation
and
condition
meeting
at
the
same
time
is
unseaworthy.
and
thats
what
your
honors
have
held.
you
held
it
in
mascuilli,
you
did
have
the
same
question
before
this
and
thats
what
you
did
hold
in
absolutely
no
uncertain
terms.
and
we
submit
may
it
please
your
honor
that
thats
the
policy
of
that
mascuilli
decision
in
line
with
the
other
decisions
of
crumady
and
mahnich
or
justification
and
authority
if
you
need
in
making
pronouncements
which
you
certainly
held
that
in
mascuilli.
and
there's
just
absolutely
no
question
about
it.
and
as
i
say,
here
where
you
have
the
--
a
defective
equipment
may
it
please
your
honor
to
say
it
one
more
time,
momentarily
can
create
a
ship
unseaworthy
or
any
kind
of
transitory
condition
can
momentarily
make
that
ship
unseaworthy.
or
active
men
--
there's
no
distinction
between
the
equipment
and
the
personnel.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
that
in
itself
can
make
it
unseaworthy.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
thank
you
very
much.
