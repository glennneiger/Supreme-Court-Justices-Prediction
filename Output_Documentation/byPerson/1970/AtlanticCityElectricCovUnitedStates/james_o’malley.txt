mr.
james
o’malley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
atlantic
city
electric
utility
and
state
appellants
appeal
here
from
the
order
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
dismissed
appellant's
complaints
seeking
permanent
injunctive
relief
from
the
same
general
revenue
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
has
been
so
clearly
described
to
your
honors
by
mr.
mccarthy.
mr.
james
o’malley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
o’malley
i
would
say
that
every
district
court
of
the
nation
could
do.
mr.
james
o’malley
however,
as
i
believe
we
suggested
in
our
briefs,
reply
briefs
and
the
government
has
in
it,
there
are
various
judicial
remedies
needless
to
mention
to
this
court
of
transfer
of
venue
and
stays
to
decide
no
other
cases
and
there's
always
the
possibility
conceivably
of
a
special
master
being
appointed
collectively
it
seems
to
us
by
a
group
of
district
courts,
if
there
are
a
multiplicity
of
this
type
of
suit.
in
this
particular
case
your
honor,
we
had
a
somewhat
different
approach
to
the
order
from
that
of
mr.
mccarthy
and
it
would
have
been
somewhat
difficult
perhaps
to
combine
the
suits.
mr.
james
o’malley
this
is
true.
mr.
james
o’malley
we
do
believe,
however
since
this
is
–
as
you
say
it
that
the
threshold,
it's
a
terribly
important
point.
we
do
note
that
there
is
a
doctrine
of
latches,
we
believe
it
would
be
applicable
in
this
area
although
there
isn't
a
statute
of
limitations.
but
the
finality
and
judicial
reviewability
of
the
commission
order
if
i
may
resume
argument
sir,
are
also
at
issue
since
in
both
cases,
since
both
courts
below
held
that
the
general
revenue
proceeding
of
the
commission
and
the
order
was
not
final
and
not
reviewable.
we
agree
with
mr.
mccarthy,
these
atlantic
city
appellants
which
are--
footnote
four,
electric
utilities
and
10
state
departments
of
agriculture
including
attorney
general
of
new
york
representing
the
state
of
new
york
department
of
agriculture.
we
agree
with
the
united
states
and
the
commission
and
the
alabama
appellants
that
the
lower
courts
were
wrong
in
dismissing
the
complaints.
we
all
agree
that
those
parts
of
the
commission
order
that
dealt
with
findings
of
general
revenue
needs
to
the
railroads,
nationwide
cost
to
the
railroads
that
the
railroads
required
additional
revenues
were
final
determinations
and
the
right
for
judicial
review.
the
position
of
these
appellants,
i
represent
differs
on
the
reviewability
point
from
that
of
the
alabama
appellants
somewhat
but
not
very
much.
the
united
states
commission
take
the
position
that
the
order
appealed
from
was
final
only
in
the
aspect
of
revenues
and
findings
of
cause.
it
is
our
position
that
the
order
should
be
reviewable
in
its
entirety
and
that
it
is
totally
right
for
judicial
review
under
the
principles
of
the
city
of
chicago,
data
processing
in
barlow
v.
collins
cases,
recently
familiar
to
this
court
--
decisions
of
this
court
and
under
the
the
general
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
railroads
differ
from
all
other
parties
by
seeking
affirmance
of
the
orders
herein
on
the
grounds
that
no
part
of
the
commission
order
can
be
reviewed
and
it's
not
final
and
not
right
for
review
but
that
is
not
reviewable
as
well.
turning
now
to
our
argument
that
the
scope
of
the
judicial
review
should
encompass
the
entire
order
your
honors.
i
believe
it
might
be
helpful
although
it
may
sound
as
though
i
am
repeating
some
of
the
things
that
mr.
mccarthy
said
to
touch
briefly
on
the
general
revenue
proceeding
itself
as
an
illustration
--
and
foundation
for
our
contention
that
the
other
parts
of
the
order
were
as
final
as
the
parts
of
the
order
which
were
alluded
to
mr.
mccarthy
and
are
accepted
by
the
government
as
reviewable.
after
the
railroads
filed
the
master
tariff
which
increased
the
rates
on
firstly
all
commodities
in
the
country
by
varying
percentages
from
3%
to
10%.
the
commission
after
suspending
the
tariff
as
mr.
mccarthy
has
said
entered
upon
an
investigation
and
of
the
proposed
increases
commodity
by
commodity.
the
railroads
consistently
refused
to
produce
any
evidence
related
to
the
costs
of
transporting
bituminous
steam
coal
or
grain,
for
example
in
the
commodity
hearings
related
to
those
commodities,
the
sub
hearings.
those
refusals
were
upheld
on
appeal
to
the
commission
within
the
framework
of
the
hearing.
the
railroads
also
failed
to
introduce
any
evidence
that
the
proposed
increases
would
not
drive
coal,
grain
the
other
commodities
from
the
railroad.
it
was
on
this
kind
of
sparse
and
deficient
record
that
the
commission
concluded
first
that
the
percentage
increases
on
coal
and
grain
and
on
all
other
commodities
that
they
finally
found
would
not
“exceed
maximum
reasonable
levels,”
and
second
that
those
increases
would
not
have
a
diversionary
effect
and
to
move
them
to
traffic
by
rail
and
to
the
spectral
latter
finding,
the
commission
said
in
its
final
order
and
then
that
this
is
in
the
appendix
of
page
393
(a)
“the
increased
freight
rates
and
charges
authorized
herein
will
have
no
on
due
adverse
effect
on
the
movement
of
traffic
by
railway”
to
be
precise.
it
is
the
position
of
these
appellants
that
such
findings
which
constitute
a
statutory
refinement
for
the
commission
permitting
the
increased
rates
to
become
effective,
have
just
as
much
finality
and
require
judicial
review
fully
as
much
as
to
its
findings
on
the
railroad
costs
and
revenue
needs.
if
your
honors
please,
there's
another
aspect
of
this
chase
of
this
revenue
proceeding
that
it
seems
to
us
should
be
equally
reviewable
and
it
relates
to
the
commission
to
purchase
from
what
we
regard
as
proper
procedures
in
conducting
the
general
revenue
proceedings
resulting
in
these
final
determinations
at
the
termination
of
the
proceeding.
we
regard
them
as
essential
to
its
findings
on
cost
revenues
and
across
the
board
commodity
percentage
increases.
for
example,
or
as
admittedly
no
participation
in
the
hearings
by
the
commission
personnel
in
the
face
of
the
kind
of
record
that
had
to
be
presented
in
a
general
revenue
proceeding
fragmented
evidence
by
many
diverse
shippers
and
the
railroad's
failure
to
present
anything
but
the
most
general
statistical
evidence
on
overall
cost
and
revenue
needs
on
a
country
wide
basis
with
no
cost
evidence
on
a
commodity
by
commodity
basis
and
no
substantial
evidence
we
submit
on
the
possible
effects
of
diversion.
it
appears
to
us
that
there
was
deficient
record
requiring
the
commission
by
counsel
and
its
staff
under
the
scenic
hudson
doctrine
decided
as
you
will
recall
in
the
second
circuit
354
f.
2d
as
to
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
at
384
u.s.
under
the
scenic
hudson
doctrine.
we
submit
that
the
commission
had
a
duty
as
an
agency,
an
obligation
to
develop
and
produce
a
complete
record
in
all
these
aspects
in
which
the
record
was
deficient
and
we
believe
that
the
order
of
the
commission
should
also
be
reviewable
in
that
light.
now
the
railroads
require
shippers
in
order
to
obtain
reviewability
of
this
order
of
the
commission
to
re-litigate
before
the
commission
and
proceedings
under
sections
13
and
15
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
all
these
issues
that
in
our
view
and
we
submit,
it
seems
apparent
from
the
record
and
the
nature
of
the
order
or
final
decisions
in
the
general
revenue
proceeding.
the
government
would
require
by
its
position
that
commission
procedures
and
findings
as
to
diversion
of
traffic
and
the
reasonableness
of
commodity
rates.
if
i
understand
the
government's
position
correctly
and
i'm
sure
mr.
springer
will
correct
me
later
if
i'm
wrong
would
have
to
be
re-litigated
in
such
proceedings.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
as
i
believe
mr.
mccarthy
has
already
advised
the
court
that
neither
sections
13
or
15
contemplates
the
review
of
determinations
of
such
broad
questions
as
are
considered
in
general
revenue
proceedings
at
which
the
commission
has
setup
to
deal
with
special
economic
problems
of
the
railroads
on
a
nationwide
basis.
those
sections
are
designed
to
review
the
particular
rate
of
a
particular
shipper
for
particular
traffics
in
particular
localities.
the
commission
is
--
after
hearings
on
these
matters
as
to
specific
rates,
then
has
the
power
to
make
reparations
or
adjustment.
they
are
not
designed
to
consider
the
question
of
the
kind
that
the
railroads
would
have
referred
to
them
or
that
the
government
would
have
referred
to
them
and
we
note
that
the
commission
itself
in
1958
i
believe,
decided
a
specific
case,
the
koppers
coal
case
at
303
icc
where
it
refused
to
review
general
revenue
findings
in
a
section
13
proceeding
brought
by
coal
shipper
and
we
believe
that
decision
is
correct
within
the
proper
statutory
scheme
and
the
government
is
in
agreement
with
us
on
this
point.
now,
these
--
if
your
honors
could
contemplate
the
situation
where
all
the
issues
in
this
general
revenue
proceedings
were
to
be
re-litigated
in
a
section
13
and
section
15
proceeding,
if
the
statute
permitted
it.
the
evidence
to
be
presented
by
the
shippers
would
have
to
be
the
same
as
it
was
presented
in
the
earlier
cases
and
rejected
by
the
commission
in
its
order
in
the
general
revenue
proceedings
on
these
broad
issues
and
with
the
same
evidence
presented
can
it
be
reasonably
contemplated
that
the
commission
would
then
conclude
that
it
had
previously
committed
error.
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
think
none
but
--
mr.
james
o’malley
mr.
justice
black
this
--
the
hearings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
were
in
1968,
commenced
in
1968.
mr.
james
o’malley
it
was
filed
in
1968
your
honor
and
in
march
of
1968
and
the
first
of
the
two
final
orders,
if
we
made
the
total
final
order
was
issued
in
november
of
‘68
and
the
second
in
january
of
'69,
the
final
order
of
two
parts.
mr.
james
o’malley
no
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
railroads
take
the
position
that
it
is
not
a
final
order
and
seek
affirmance
of
the
court
below
to
that
effect
and
the
government,
the
commission
and
department
of
justice
of
united
states
take
the
position
that
part
of
the
order
is
not
final.
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
all
of
the
order
is
final.
mr.
james
o’malley
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
o’malley
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
o’malley
we
would
have
to
challenge
the
rate
just
because
--
mr.
james
o’malley
i
am
not
completely
clear
from
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
o’malley
and
the
commission
had
let
it
go
into
effect.
the
procedure
then
your
honor
would
be
the
--
to
make
a
complaint
in
section
13
--
mr.
james
o’malley
the
issues
in
that
proceeding
would
be
those
specified
in
the
statute
whether
the
particular
rate
over
that
particular
route
with
that
particular
traffic
is
unjust,
unreasonable,
discriminatory,
preferential.
mr.
james
o’malley
although
it's
not
very
specific
beyond
that
your
honor
but
beyond
the
provision
except
that
it
does
require.
i
believe
that
they
consider
diversionary
effects
with
respect
to
those
particular
rates
but
here
your
honor
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
james
o’malley
no,
i
don't
believe,
well
yes
under
section
1582
for
that
particular
traffic,
i
believe
that
--
that
i
would
have
to
answer
yes.
the
revenue
needs
the
railroad.
mr.
james
o’malley
thank
you,
i'm
not,
i
will
continue
--
mr.
james
o’malley
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
o’malley
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
return
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
just
before
the
recess
which
i
don't
believe
i
have
explored
sufficiently
for
his
purposes.
as
i
understood
it,
the
question
was
whether
if
the
carriers
had
filed
specific
rates
on
our
traffics,
the
coal
and
grain
traffics,
could
we
obtain
review?
and
of
course
if
that
had
happened,
one
of
two
things
would
have
taken
place.
either
the
commission
would
have
suspended
and
investigated
those
rates
in
a
same
way
as
it
did
here
for
the
general
investigation
and
then
decided
the
case
and
if
it
decided
adversely.
we
believe
that
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
order
would
have
been
reviewable
by
a
three-judge
court
just
as
we
feel
this
order
here
should
be
reviewable
by
three-judge
court
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
city
of
chicago.
in
fact,
all
we're
asking
for
here
is
exactly
the
same
review
your
honors
to
which
we
would
have
been
entitled
in
the
situation
which
mr.
justice
white
hypothesized.
mr.
james
o’malley
the
issues
would
have
been
--
mr.
james
o’malley
that's
right,
that
just
as
unreasonable
for
the
rate
and
the
factors
that
would
have
been
opened
would
have
been
to
the
extent
of
those
particular
rates
a
diversionary
effect
of
the
increases
on
those
particular
traffics,
which
would
not
have
taken
into
account
the
total
diversionary
effects
that
we
feel
have
been
decided
in
this
case
on
a
nationwide
basis
and
to
the
extent
it
was
possible
in
this
miniscule
section
of
the
total
revenue
picture
of
the
railroads.
to
determine
the
revenue
needs
related
to
those
particular
tariffs
perhaps
but
not
the
broad
based
kind
of
hearing
that
we
had
in
the
--
what
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
where
all
the
nationwide
statistics
and
commodities
are
involved
and
the
commission
has
authorized
a
raise
in
rates
across
the
country
which
affects
every
tariff
in
the
country
based
on
the
premises
determined
in
the
investigation
and
hearing
they
started
here
in
section
157,
which
indeed
is
determinative
of
these
issues
to
the
point
of
authorizing
the
railroads
to
raise
their
rates
on
all
these
commodities.
there
is
where
our
point
of
review
comes,
i
submit.
mr.
james
o’malley
well,
the
interest
in
our
clients
are
really
in
getting
a
judicial
review
of
the
acts
of
the
commission
in
making
determination
that
results
in
an
increase
across
the
board
on
the
rates
of
our
traffic
and
if
that
is
properly
--
sorry
sir.
mr.
james
o’malley
we
are
interested
in
our
own
traffic
ultimately
yes
your
honor
but
we
are
interested
--
mr.
james
o’malley
no
your
honor,
we
are
interested
in
litigating
the
entire
in
having
a
review
of
the
entire
proceeding
which
happened
to
impinge
on
us
to
the
extent
of
many
millions
of
dollars
by
virtue
of
an
overall
decision
which
we
claim
is
unsoundly
based
in
fact
and
law.
mr.
james
o’malley
we
want
to
argue
that
it's
unsound
with
respect
to
our
traffic
of
course
but
we
want
to
also
argue
that
--
and
our
traffics
--
mr.
james
o’malley
if
your
honor
please
i
believe
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
would
take
place
were
just
sent
back
for
review
by
the
three-judge
court
would
review
the
issues
in
the
big
proceeding
that
impinged
on
the
traffics,
we
were
concerned
with
and
would
order
if
any
refunds
or
the
refunds
related
to
our
traffics.
not
the
entire
order,
i
would
assume
that
the
court
would
limit
the
impact
of
its
findings
to
the
situation
of
the
complainants.
that
would
be
my
interpretation
of
what
would
happen.
mr.
james
o’malley
yes
your
honor
because
mr.
chief
justice
the
only
reason
these
rates
have
been
raised
and
the
reason
we
ask
a
review
of
this
investigation
of
the
commission
which
determined
these
rates
could
be
raised
by
this
much
was
on
the
basis
of
a
record
which
we
claim
as
deficient,
improperly
assembled
and
evidence
insubstantially
founded
and
that
there
were
proper
considerations
as
the
statute
requires
under
section
1582
of
diversion
where
a
final
finding
suit
have
been
made
as
to
diversion
and
were
as
we
contend
and
we
feel
that
we
have
been
misdealt
with
our
clients
have
been
misdealt
with
by
the
commission
in
the
way
it
conducted
its
proceeding.
mr.
james
o’malley
i
think
that
would
be
difficult
to
do
except
to
say
that
our
clients
perhaps
are
involved
in
something
of
the
order
of
five
million
dollars
a
year
of
rate
increases
in
a
very
broad
sense
against
maybe
400
million
dollars
worth
of
rate
increases
on
the
total
authorized
by
the
commission
but
this
is
a
very
difficult
figure
to
arrive
at
with
any
precision
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
conclude
my
argument
if
i
may
and
leave
to
whatever
minutes
are
left
to
mr.
mccarthy
who
has
reserved
it
for
rebuttal
simply
asking
that
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
order
of
the
lower
court
and
remand
for
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
james
o’malley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
atlantic
city
electric
utility
and
state
appellants
appeal
here
from
the
order
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
dismissed
appellant's
complaints
seeking
permanent
injunctive
relief
from
the
same
general
revenue
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
has
been
so
clearly
described
to
your
honors
by
mr.
mccarthy.
mr.
james
o’malley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
o’malley
i
would
say
that
every
district
court
of
the
nation
could
do.
mr.
james
o’malley
however,
as
i
believe
we
suggested
in
our
briefs,
reply
briefs
and
the
government
has
in
it,
there
are
various
judicial
remedies
needless
to
mention
to
this
court
of
transfer
of
venue
and
stays
to
decide
no
other
cases
and
there's
always
the
possibility
conceivably
of
a
special
master
being
appointed
collectively
it
seems
to
us
by
a
group
of
district
courts,
if
there
are
a
multiplicity
of
this
type
of
suit.
in
this
particular
case
your
honor,
we
had
a
somewhat
different
approach
to
the
order
from
that
of
mr.
mccarthy
and
it
would
have
been
somewhat
difficult
perhaps
to
combine
the
suits.
mr.
james
o’malley
this
is
true.
mr.
james
o’malley
we
do
believe,
however
since
this
is
–
as
you
say
it
that
the
threshold,
it's
a
terribly
important
point.
we
do
note
that
there
is
a
doctrine
of
latches,
we
believe
it
would
be
applicable
in
this
area
although
there
isn't
a
statute
of
limitations.
but
the
finality
and
judicial
reviewability
of
the
commission
order
if
i
may
resume
argument
sir,
are
also
at
issue
since
in
both
cases,
since
both
courts
below
held
that
the
general
revenue
proceeding
of
the
commission
and
the
order
was
not
final
and
not
reviewable.
we
agree
with
mr.
mccarthy,
these
atlantic
city
appellants
which
are--
footnote
four,
electric
utilities
and
10
state
departments
of
agriculture
including
attorney
general
of
new
york
representing
the
state
of
new
york
department
of
agriculture.
we
agree
with
the
united
states
and
the
commission
and
the
alabama
appellants
that
the
lower
courts
were
wrong
in
dismissing
the
complaints.
we
all
agree
that
those
parts
of
the
commission
order
that
dealt
with
findings
of
general
revenue
needs
to
the
railroads,
nationwide
cost
to
the
railroads
that
the
railroads
required
additional
revenues
were
final
determinations
and
the
right
for
judicial
review.
the
position
of
these
appellants,
i
represent
differs
on
the
reviewability
point
from
that
of
the
alabama
appellants
somewhat
but
not
very
much.
the
united
states
commission
take
the
position
that
the
order
appealed
from
was
final
only
in
the
aspect
of
revenues
and
findings
of
cause.
it
is
our
position
that
the
order
should
be
reviewable
in
its
entirety
and
that
it
is
totally
right
for
judicial
review
under
the
principles
of
the
city
of
chicago,
data
processing
in
barlow
v.
collins
cases,
recently
familiar
to
this
court
--
decisions
of
this
court
and
under
the
the
general
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
railroads
differ
from
all
other
parties
by
seeking
affirmance
of
the
orders
herein
on
the
grounds
that
no
part
of
the
commission
order
can
be
reviewed
and
it's
not
final
and
not
right
for
review
but
that
is
not
reviewable
as
well.
turning
now
to
our
argument
that
the
scope
of
the
judicial
review
should
encompass
the
entire
order
your
honors.
i
believe
it
might
be
helpful
although
it
may
sound
as
though
i
am
repeating
some
of
the
things
that
mr.
mccarthy
said
to
touch
briefly
on
the
general
revenue
proceeding
itself
as
an
illustration
--
and
foundation
for
our
contention
that
the
other
parts
of
the
order
were
as
final
as
the
parts
of
the
order
which
were
alluded
to
mr.
mccarthy
and
are
accepted
by
the
government
as
reviewable.
after
the
railroads
filed
the
master
tariff
which
increased
the
rates
on
firstly
all
commodities
in
the
country
by
varying
percentages
from
3%
to
10%.
the
commission
after
suspending
the
tariff
as
mr.
mccarthy
has
said
entered
upon
an
investigation
and
of
the
proposed
increases
commodity
by
commodity.
the
railroads
consistently
refused
to
produce
any
evidence
related
to
the
costs
of
transporting
bituminous
steam
coal
or
grain,
for
example
in
the
commodity
hearings
related
to
those
commodities,
the
sub
hearings.
those
refusals
were
upheld
on
appeal
to
the
commission
within
the
framework
of
the
hearing.
the
railroads
also
failed
to
introduce
any
evidence
that
the
proposed
increases
would
not
drive
coal,
grain
the
other
commodities
from
the
railroad.
it
was
on
this
kind
of
sparse
and
deficient
record
that
the
commission
concluded
first
that
the
percentage
increases
on
coal
and
grain
and
on
all
other
commodities
that
they
finally
found
would
not
“exceed
maximum
reasonable
levels,”
and
second
that
those
increases
would
not
have
a
diversionary
effect
and
to
move
them
to
traffic
by
rail
and
to
the
spectral
latter
finding,
the
commission
said
in
its
final
order
and
then
that
this
is
in
the
appendix
of
page
393
(a)
“the
increased
freight
rates
and
charges
authorized
herein
will
have
no
on
due
adverse
effect
on
the
movement
of
traffic
by
railway”
to
be
precise.
it
is
the
position
of
these
appellants
that
such
findings
which
constitute
a
statutory
refinement
for
the
commission
permitting
the
increased
rates
to
become
effective,
have
just
as
much
finality
and
require
judicial
review
fully
as
much
as
to
its
findings
on
the
railroad
costs
and
revenue
needs.
if
your
honors
please,
there's
another
aspect
of
this
chase
of
this
revenue
proceeding
that
it
seems
to
us
should
be
equally
reviewable
and
it
relates
to
the
commission
to
purchase
from
what
we
regard
as
proper
procedures
in
conducting
the
general
revenue
proceedings
resulting
in
these
final
determinations
at
the
termination
of
the
proceeding.
we
regard
them
as
essential
to
its
findings
on
cost
revenues
and
across
the
board
commodity
percentage
increases.
for
example,
or
as
admittedly
no
participation
in
the
hearings
by
the
commission
personnel
in
the
face
of
the
kind
of
record
that
had
to
be
presented
in
a
general
revenue
proceeding
fragmented
evidence
by
many
diverse
shippers
and
the
railroad's
failure
to
present
anything
but
the
most
general
statistical
evidence
on
overall
cost
and
revenue
needs
on
a
country
wide
basis
with
no
cost
evidence
on
a
commodity
by
commodity
basis
and
no
substantial
evidence
we
submit
on
the
possible
effects
of
diversion.
it
appears
to
us
that
there
was
deficient
record
requiring
the
commission
by
counsel
and
its
staff
under
the
scenic
hudson
doctrine
decided
as
you
will
recall
in
the
second
circuit
354
f.
2d
as
to
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
at
384
u.s.
under
the
scenic
hudson
doctrine.
we
submit
that
the
commission
had
a
duty
as
an
agency,
an
obligation
to
develop
and
produce
a
complete
record
in
all
these
aspects
in
which
the
record
was
deficient
and
we
believe
that
the
order
of
the
commission
should
also
be
reviewable
in
that
light.
now
the
railroads
require
shippers
in
order
to
obtain
reviewability
of
this
order
of
the
commission
to
re-litigate
before
the
commission
and
proceedings
under
sections
13
and
15
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
all
these
issues
that
in
our
view
and
we
submit,
it
seems
apparent
from
the
record
and
the
nature
of
the
order
or
final
decisions
in
the
general
revenue
proceeding.
the
government
would
require
by
its
position
that
commission
procedures
and
findings
as
to
diversion
of
traffic
and
the
reasonableness
of
commodity
rates.
if
i
understand
the
government's
position
correctly
and
i'm
sure
mr.
springer
will
correct
me
later
if
i'm
wrong
would
have
to
be
re-litigated
in
such
proceedings.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
as
i
believe
mr.
mccarthy
has
already
advised
the
court
that
neither
sections
13
or
15
contemplates
the
review
of
determinations
of
such
broad
questions
as
are
considered
in
general
revenue
proceedings
at
which
the
commission
has
setup
to
deal
with
special
economic
problems
of
the
railroads
on
a
nationwide
basis.
those
sections
are
designed
to
review
the
particular
rate
of
a
particular
shipper
for
particular
traffics
in
particular
localities.
the
commission
is
--
after
hearings
on
these
matters
as
to
specific
rates,
then
has
the
power
to
make
reparations
or
adjustment.
they
are
not
designed
to
consider
the
question
of
the
kind
that
the
railroads
would
have
referred
to
them
or
that
the
government
would
have
referred
to
them
and
we
note
that
the
commission
itself
in
1958
i
believe,
decided
a
specific
case,
the
koppers
coal
case
at
303
icc
where
it
refused
to
review
general
revenue
findings
in
a
section
13
proceeding
brought
by
coal
shipper
and
we
believe
that
decision
is
correct
within
the
proper
statutory
scheme
and
the
government
is
in
agreement
with
us
on
this
point.
now,
these
--
if
your
honors
could
contemplate
the
situation
where
all
the
issues
in
this
general
revenue
proceedings
were
to
be
re-litigated
in
a
section
13
and
section
15
proceeding,
if
the
statute
permitted
it.
the
evidence
to
be
presented
by
the
shippers
would
have
to
be
the
same
as
it
was
presented
in
the
earlier
cases
and
rejected
by
the
commission
in
its
order
in
the
general
revenue
proceedings
on
these
broad
issues
and
with
the
same
evidence
presented
can
it
be
reasonably
contemplated
that
the
commission
would
then
conclude
that
it
had
previously
committed
error.
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
think
none
but
--
mr.
james
o’malley
mr.
justice
black
this
--
the
hearings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
were
in
1968,
commenced
in
1968.
mr.
james
o’malley
it
was
filed
in
1968
your
honor
and
in
march
of
1968
and
the
first
of
the
two
final
orders,
if
we
made
the
total
final
order
was
issued
in
november
of
‘68
and
the
second
in
january
of
'69,
the
final
order
of
two
parts.
mr.
james
o’malley
no
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
railroads
take
the
position
that
it
is
not
a
final
order
and
seek
affirmance
of
the
court
below
to
that
effect
and
the
government,
the
commission
and
department
of
justice
of
united
states
take
the
position
that
part
of
the
order
is
not
final.
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
all
of
the
order
is
final.
mr.
james
o’malley
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
james
o’malley
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
o’malley
we
would
have
to
challenge
the
rate
just
because
--
mr.
james
o’malley
i
am
not
completely
clear
from
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
o’malley
and
the
commission
had
let
it
go
into
effect.
the
procedure
then
your
honor
would
be
the
--
to
make
a
complaint
in
section
13
--
mr.
james
o’malley
the
issues
in
that
proceeding
would
be
those
specified
in
the
statute
whether
the
particular
rate
over
that
particular
route
with
that
particular
traffic
is
unjust,
unreasonable,
discriminatory,
preferential.
mr.
james
o’malley
although
it's
not
very
specific
beyond
that
your
honor
but
beyond
the
provision
except
that
it
does
require.
i
believe
that
they
consider
diversionary
effects
with
respect
to
those
particular
rates
but
here
your
honor
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
james
o’malley
no,
i
don't
believe,
well
yes
under
section
1582
for
that
particular
traffic,
i
believe
that
--
that
i
would
have
to
answer
yes.
the
revenue
needs
the
railroad.
mr.
james
o’malley
thank
you,
i'm
not,
i
will
continue
--
mr.
james
o’malley
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
o’malley
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
return
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
just
before
the
recess
which
i
don't
believe
i
have
explored
sufficiently
for
his
purposes.
as
i
understood
it,
the
question
was
whether
if
the
carriers
had
filed
specific
rates
on
our
traffics,
the
coal
and
grain
traffics,
could
we
obtain
review?
and
of
course
if
that
had
happened,
one
of
two
things
would
have
taken
place.
either
the
commission
would
have
suspended
and
investigated
those
rates
in
a
same
way
as
it
did
here
for
the
general
investigation
and
then
decided
the
case
and
if
it
decided
adversely.
we
believe
that
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
order
would
have
been
reviewable
by
a
three-judge
court
just
as
we
feel
this
order
here
should
be
reviewable
by
three-judge
court
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
city
of
chicago.
in
fact,
all
we're
asking
for
here
is
exactly
the
same
review
your
honors
to
which
we
would
have
been
entitled
in
the
situation
which
mr.
justice
white
hypothesized.
mr.
james
o’malley
the
issues
would
have
been
--
mr.
james
o’malley
that's
right,
that
just
as
unreasonable
for
the
rate
and
the
factors
that
would
have
been
opened
would
have
been
to
the
extent
of
those
particular
rates
a
diversionary
effect
of
the
increases
on
those
particular
traffics,
which
would
not
have
taken
into
account
the
total
diversionary
effects
that
we
feel
have
been
decided
in
this
case
on
a
nationwide
basis
and
to
the
extent
it
was
possible
in
this
miniscule
section
of
the
total
revenue
picture
of
the
railroads.
to
determine
the
revenue
needs
related
to
those
particular
tariffs
perhaps
but
not
the
broad
based
kind
of
hearing
that
we
had
in
the
--
what
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
where
all
the
nationwide
statistics
and
commodities
are
involved
and
the
commission
has
authorized
a
raise
in
rates
across
the
country
which
affects
every
tariff
in
the
country
based
on
the
premises
determined
in
the
investigation
and
hearing
they
started
here
in
section
157,
which
indeed
is
determinative
of
these
issues
to
the
point
of
authorizing
the
railroads
to
raise
their
rates
on
all
these
commodities.
there
is
where
our
point
of
review
comes,
i
submit.
mr.
james
o’malley
well,
the
interest
in
our
clients
are
really
in
getting
a
judicial
review
of
the
acts
of
the
commission
in
making
determination
that
results
in
an
increase
across
the
board
on
the
rates
of
our
traffic
and
if
that
is
properly
--
sorry
sir.
mr.
james
o’malley
we
are
interested
in
our
own
traffic
ultimately
yes
your
honor
but
we
are
interested
--
mr.
james
o’malley
no
your
honor,
we
are
interested
in
litigating
the
entire
in
having
a
review
of
the
entire
proceeding
which
happened
to
impinge
on
us
to
the
extent
of
many
millions
of
dollars
by
virtue
of
an
overall
decision
which
we
claim
is
unsoundly
based
in
fact
and
law.
mr.
james
o’malley
we
want
to
argue
that
it's
unsound
with
respect
to
our
traffic
of
course
but
we
want
to
also
argue
that
--
and
our
traffics
--
mr.
james
o’malley
if
your
honor
please
i
believe
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
would
take
place
were
just
sent
back
for
review
by
the
three-judge
court
would
review
the
issues
in
the
big
proceeding
that
impinged
on
the
traffics,
we
were
concerned
with
and
would
order
if
any
refunds
or
the
refunds
related
to
our
traffics.
not
the
entire
order,
i
would
assume
that
the
court
would
limit
the
impact
of
its
findings
to
the
situation
of
the
complainants.
that
would
be
my
interpretation
of
what
would
happen.
mr.
james
o’malley
yes
your
honor
because
mr.
chief
justice
the
only
reason
these
rates
have
been
raised
and
the
reason
we
ask
a
review
of
this
investigation
of
the
commission
which
determined
these
rates
could
be
raised
by
this
much
was
on
the
basis
of
a
record
which
we
claim
as
deficient,
improperly
assembled
and
evidence
insubstantially
founded
and
that
there
were
proper
considerations
as
the
statute
requires
under
section
1582
of
diversion
where
a
final
finding
suit
have
been
made
as
to
diversion
and
were
as
we
contend
and
we
feel
that
we
have
been
misdealt
with
our
clients
have
been
misdealt
with
by
the
commission
in
the
way
it
conducted
its
proceeding.
mr.
james
o’malley
i
think
that
would
be
difficult
to
do
except
to
say
that
our
clients
perhaps
are
involved
in
something
of
the
order
of
five
million
dollars
a
year
of
rate
increases
in
a
very
broad
sense
against
maybe
400
million
dollars
worth
of
rate
increases
on
the
total
authorized
by
the
commission
but
this
is
a
very
difficult
figure
to
arrive
at
with
any
precision
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
conclude
my
argument
if
i
may
and
leave
to
whatever
minutes
are
left
to
mr.
mccarthy
who
has
reserved
it
for
rebuttal
simply
asking
that
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
order
of
the
lower
court
and
remand
for
trial.
thank
you.
