mr.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
three
distinct
federal
government
parties.
first
the
united
states
which
was
a
statutory
defendant
in
the
district
court
as
it
is
in
most
icc
review
proceedings.
second,
the
commission
itself
whose
order
is
in
question
and
third
the
secretary
of
agriculture
who
has
an
independent
statutory
responsibility
in
icc
proceedings
involving
rates
on
farm
products.
the
secretary
was
a
party
in
the
commission
proceedings
below
and
he
intervened
as
a
plaintiff
in
the
district
court
proceedings
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
that
is
the
alabama
power
case.
though
he
did
not
become
a
party,
as
the
secretary
in
the
atlantic
city
electric
case
which
was
subsequently
began
in
new
york.
because
of
their
differing
responsibilities,
these
three
federal
parties
have
taken
different
positions
on
the
merits
of
the
icc
order.
secretary
of
agriculture
generally
cites
but
the
plaintiffs
in
the
alabama
power
case.
the
commission
of
course
defends
its
order
on
the
merits
and
the
united
states
though
a
statutory
party
concluded
that
it
could
neither
support
nor
oppose
the
commission's
order
in
the
district
court
proceedings.
that
the
courts
below
did
not
reach
the
merits
and
so
we
submit
they
are
not
in
issue
here
since
the
courts
below
both
dismissed
the
complaints
before
them
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
state
a
claim
for
relief
that
is
a
claim
for
judicial
review.
so
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
threshold
question,
whether
the
commission's
order
was
reviewable,
is
reviewable
and
if
so
to
what
extent.
mr.
springer
as
to
that
i'm
just
going
to
say
mr.
justice
black
the
--
my
three
clients
are
substantially
in
agreement
on
that
which
is
why
i
think
i
can
appropriately
speak
for
all
of
them.
we
believe
that
the
alabama
power
case
complaint
in
the
columbia
district
court
does
state
a
claim
for
judicial
review
and
so
we
agree,
i
think
completely
with
mr.
mccarthy's
clients
in
that
case.
in
the
atlantic
city
electric
case
there
is
to
be
sure
a
relatively
minor
disagreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
commission
which
are
the
only
two
federal
parties
in
that
case
but
in
terms
of
the
relief
we
suggest
a
remand
of
that
case.
this
difference
becomes
of
relatively
little
importance.
both
the
united
states
and
the
commission
do
however
disagree
significantly
with
the
plaintiffs
in
the
atlantic
city
electric
case
as
i
shall
elaborate
in
a
minute.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
to
that
the
only
disagreement
among
any
of
the
parties
including
the
railroads
on
this
reviewability
question
is
a
disagreement
as
to
whether
the
various
aspects
of
the
general
revenue
order
have
sufficient
pragmatic
finality
to
make
review
appropriate
now
or
whether
on
the
other
hand,
review
should
be
differed
until
shippers
have
exhausted
further
administrative
remedies
of
challenging
particular
rates
by
complaints
under
section
13
of
the
act
which
the
commission
would
then
consider
under
section
151
after
the
rates
have
gone
into
effect.
we
think
that
it's
clear
from
both
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
city
of
chicago
case
and
more
particularly
on
this
issue
from
the
decision
several
years
ago
in
abbot
laboratories
against
gardner
that
this
is
the
only
question.
abbot
laboratories,
i
think
established
the
proposition
that
review
should
be
available
at
the
earlier
stage
at
which
the
agency
has
made
a
final
determination
and
a
controversy
as
to
the
validity
of
that
determination
has
rightly
as
to
the
existence
of
controversy.
i
think
there's
no
question
here.
the
shippers
are
paying
higher
rates
because
of
the
commission's
decisions
so
the
only
question
i
think
fairly
is
finality
which
as
the
court
again
indicated
in
abbot
laboratories,
there
is
a
pragmatic
question
based
upon
a
careful
analysis
of
what
the
agency
has
actually
done
and
what
kind
of
attack,
the
parties
seeking
review
are
making
upon
what
the
agency
is
done.
so
that
i
think
i
should
proceed
now
to
review
once
again
and
perhaps
from
a
somewhat
different
aspect.
the
issues
that
were
before
the
commission
in
this
general
revenue
proceeding
and
what
the
commission
did
with
those
issues.
the
general
revenue
proceeding
is
an
investigation
under
section
157
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
generally
permits
the
commission
to
make
a
final
determination
in
advance
of
the
effectiveness
of
new
rates
as
to
whether
those
rates
are
lawful
or
not.
section
157
explicitly
permits
the
commission
to
do
an
advance.
everything
that
it
could
do
after
the
effectiveness
of
new
rates
under
section
151
and
the
151
proceeding
could
be
either
on
the
commission's
own
motion
or
in
response
to
a
complaint
by
shipper
under
section
13.
both
therefore
--
both
of
these
subsections
contemplate
that
the
commission
will
make
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
that
is
it
will
determine
whether
the
rates
are
just
unreasonable
and
further
whether
they
are
called
unjustly
discriminatory
or
unduly
preferential
or
prejudicial
and
section
1582
expands
upon
just
and
reasonable
standard,
so
that
that
inquiry
in
substance
includes
two
questions.
first,
what
are
the
railroads
revenue
needs
if
they
are
to
provide
adequate
and
efficient
service
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
with
the
furnishing
of
such
service
and
under
honest
economical
and
efficient
management.
and
the
second
question
under
the
just
and
reasonable
rubric
is
what
effect
will
an
increase
in
whatever
rates
are
in
question
have
upon
the
movement
of
traffic,
more
particularly
will
they
--
will
such
an
increase
divert
traffic
from
the
rail
carriage
to
such
an
extent
as
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
increase.
now
when
all
the
rail
roads
in
the
country
want
to
as
they
did
here
and
as
they
have
previously
and
subsequently
want
to
increase
all
of
their
freight
rates
to
compensate
for
increased
costs.
it's
obvious
that
the
commission
cannot
feasibly
make
all
of
these
determinations
within
the
seven
month
suspension
period
that
is
allowed
under
section
157
before
the
new
rates
can
be
allowed
to
come
into
effect.
and
of
course
the
railroads
claim
and
the
commission
has
to
give
effect
to
their
claim
that
they
have
an
urgent
need
for
an
increase
when
this
kind
of
situation
comes
up.
on
the
other
hand
the
commission
frequently
concludes
as
it
did
here
that
it
should
not
allow
the
railroads
to
increase
their
rates
generally
without
some
prior
investigation.
in
consequence,
many
years
ago
the
commission
developed
the
general
revenue
proceeding
which
is
a
limited
kind
of
section
157
proceeding
in
which
the
commission
generally
examines
the
proposed
across
the
board
tariff
increases
but
expressly
refrains
from
determining
the
lawfulness
of
each
and
every
rate
that
would
be
increased.
mr.
springer
that's
true
mr.
justice
white.
what
it
does
it
--
and
i
will
elaborate
on
this,
it
gives
a
kind
of
--.
it
may
determine
as
to
some
rates
that
they
are
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
therefore
should
be
lowered
and
in
fact
they
did
that
in
a
limited
number
of
instances
in
this
case
but
it
does
not
exhaustively
look
at
each
and
every
grade
under
--
mr.
springer
yes,
well
in
a
nutshell,
i
don't
think
any
of
them
are
necessarily
legally
foreclosed.
however
as
to
the
general
revenue
needs
question,
practically
they
are
foreclosed.
mr.
springer
not
as
a
matter
of
strict
law,
practically
speaking
though
as
to
the
general
revenue
needs
question
that
is
a
question
which
we
agree
with
the
alabama
power
plaintiffs
has
been
thoroughly
considered
and
thoroughly
decided
by
the
commission.
mr.
springer
no,
it
is
a
matter,
i
suppose
of
stare
decisis
as
to
--
mr.
springer
yes
but
in
the
pragmatic
terms
in
which
we're
talking,
that
subsequent
court
review
of
this
question
would
be
in
no
way,
no
realistic
way
aided
by
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
additional
agency
proceeding
in
the
interim
as
to
the
general
revenue
needs
question.
mr.
springer
yes,
and
now
as
to
other
issues
--
mr.
springer
yes.
mr.
springer
as
to
that
rate
except
to
that
--
mr.
springer
yes.
that
certainly
could
be
done
but
our
position
basically
as
to
the
general
revenue
proceeding
is
that
since
the
court
should
review
as
soon
as
it
can,
as
soon
as
there
is
sufficient
administrative
finality,
it
should
not
be
required
to
wait,
it
might
wait
but
it
would
be
better
policy
and
it's
not
necessary
to
wait
as
to
the
issues
that
have
been
finally
decided
in
the
general
proceedings
though
i
agree
it
would
be
possible
for
the
court
to
review
it
later
on.
mr.
springer
yes,
and
frankly
the
time
table
of
this
proceeding
was
dictated
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
suspended
the
rates.
it's
allowed
under
the
statute
to
suspend
only
for
seven
months.
the
commission's
decision
came,
final
order
came
down,
i
think
six-and-a-half
months
or
perhaps
a
little
more
after
the
proceeding
had
began
and
at
that
point
the
--
mr.
springer
yes,
by
instituting
a
new
proceeding
which
of
course
would
take
some
time
and
it
might
be
a
year
or
two
later
by
the
time
judicial
review
could
be
had
as
to
that.
mr.
springer
that's
what
the
language
in
that
opinion.
i
would
not
want
to
--
i
don't
think
the
commission
would
want
me
to
hang
too
much
on
the
relatively
brief
language
in
that
opinion.
mr.
springer
yes.
mr.
springer
and
as
to
the
general
revenue.
mr.
springer
yes
and
as
to
the
general
revenue
findings,
the
only
thing
it
could
do
in
such
a
further
proceeding
would
be
a
kind
of
reconsideration
of
what
it
had
already
decided
for.
mr.
springer
yes,
it's
true
in
that
case
though
again
it's
--
i
think
i
do
have
honestly
i
have
to
say
that
that
does
not
reflect
a
fully
fleshed
out
and
thought
out
commission
consideration
of
exactly
the
kind
of
problem
that
we
have
here.
and
of
course,
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
that
the
fact
that
reconsideration
by
the
administrative
agency
is
available
does
not
preclude
judicial
review
before
such
reconsideration.
so
that
we
agree
that
as
to
the
general
revenue
questions,
which
are
essential
underpinnings
of
the
great
increase,
if
the
commission
had
disagreed
with
the
railroads
submissions
that
they
needed
more
revenue,
the
commission
would
have
not
allowed
the
increase.
so
that's
an
essential
condition
to
the
increase,
one
that
the
commission
considered
separately,
considered
finally
to
the
extent
if
at
all
there
are
any
further
administrative
proceedings
possible
as
to
that
issue.
they're
only
in
the
nature
for
reconsideration
and
the
availability
of
such
reconsideration
if
there
is
such
availability
is
not
a
part
to
judicial
review.
this
brings
me
then
to
the
other
issues.
the
issues
with
which
at
least
in
large
part,
the
new
york
plaintiffs
are
concerned
having
concluded
that
the
railroads
revenue
needs
justified
an
increase
to
a
certain
average
level.
the
commission
went
on
to
consider
the
propriety
of
the
allocation
of
the
additional
revenues
among
various
shippers
and
various
commodities.
in
particular,
it
had
to
consider
or
that
section
151
and
7
contemplate
that
it
would
consider
whether
the
rates
would
have
adverse
effects
on
the
movement
of
traffic,
that
is
diversion
and
whether
the
rates
are
discriminatory
or
preferential.
here
the
question
is
not
what
the
railroads
need
but
what
individual
shippers
and
shipping
various
things
in
various
places
are
willing
to
pay
rather
than
decide
not
to
ship
by
rail
and
what
they
can
fairly
be
required
to
pay
considering
the
relationships
among
the
various
rates
and
other
matters.
as
i
say
the
commission
has
given
some
consideration
to
these
matters
and
the
general
revenue
proceeding
and
it
did
throw
out
a
relatively
small
number
of
the
particular
rates
because
of
defects
that
became
apparent
to
the
commission.
and
it's
kind
of
preliminary
once
over
on
these
detailed
rate
by
rate
or
rate
group
by
rate
group
issues.
but
it
certainly
did
not
conclude
exhaustively
that
no
rate
might
have
such
a
defect
and
therefore
expressly
left
open
as
it
does
in
these
general
rate
proceedings.
left
it
open
for
shippers
to
institute
subsequent
proceedings
by
complaints
under
section
13
which
could
result
in
section
151
proceedings
to
attack
particular
rates
of
interest
to
them.
specifically
with
reference
to
this
court's
decision
many
years
ago
in
the
arizona
grocery
case,
the
commission
said
that
we
are
not
hereby
prescribing
all
of
the
rates
which
we
are
in
this
kind
of
limited
proceeding
allowing
the
railroads
to
increase
generally.
so
that
we
think
that
the
complaint
in
the
atlantic
city
case
is
in
large
measure
an
attack
on
this
second
aspect
of
the
general
revenue
proceeding
that
the
commission
had
it
once
over
on
particular
rates
and
this
are
matters
which
while
the
commission
has
considered
them,
it
has
not
considered
them
finally
and
could
not
on
the
record
that
the
commission
had
before
it
and
could
have
it
before
it
and
a
proceeding
under
the
kind
of
time
pressures
if
there
are
in
a
general
revenue
proceedings.
in
short,
these
shippers
have
not
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies
and
we
think
that
judicial
review
should
not
be
available.
as
i
indicated
there
is
a
minor
disagreement
in
framework
--
in
the
terms
of
the
framework
of
this
case
between
the
commission
and
the
united
states.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
not
being
a
party
in
this
case.
the
united
states
believes
that
the
atlantic
city
complaints
can
be
read
perhaps
as
raising
an
attack
on
the
general
revenue
needs
findings
and
perhaps
also
as
raising
an
attack
upon
the
general
nature
of
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
the
commission
has
had.
that
of
course
is
--
the
commission
has
finally
decided
what
kind
of
proceeding
it's
going
to
have.
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
shippers
may
want
to
raise
the
question
whether
the
commission
can
have
a
general
revenue
proceeding
without
finally
determining
all
of
the
multitude
of
rates
involved.
that
theoretically
at
least
is
a
question
that
is
right
for
judicial
review
after
the
general
review
proceeding
is
over.
but
the
commission
of
united
states
does
agree
that
under
all
the
circumstances
as
to
the
new
york
case,
it
is
appropriate
to
remand
that
case
so
that
the
parties
can
amend
their
--
plaintiffs
can
amend
complaints
if
they
wish
and
that
the
district
court
can
shape
the
litigation
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
that
we
have
suggested.
let
me
say
a
further
word
about
relief
--
mr.
springer
yes,
completely
in
sympathy
in
the
alabama
power
case
which
was
the
case
he
was
focusing
on.
mr.
springer
yes
he
did.
a
problem
with
the
atlantic
city
case
is
that
that
district
court
in
new
york
seems
to
have
read
the
complaint
as
having
the
generality
that
what
we
believe
the
alabama
power
complaint
has
and
dismissing
it
on
the
same
theory
that
the
majority
of
the
district
court
and
the
district
of
columbia
dismissed
the
complaint
there
and
i
think
they
have
improperly
read
the
complaint
and
also
reached
and
in
terms
of
that
judgment
--
in
terms
of
that
reading
made
an
improper
judgment.
there
is
the
problem
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
has
adverted
a
multiple
district
court
proceedings
and
matters
of
this
kind.
accordingly,
we
would
suggest
that
in
this
case,
the
new
york
court
might
well
be
instructed
to
stay
its
hand
until
the
district
court
proceeding
and
the
district
of
columbia
is
completed.
that
case
was
filed
first,
it
involves
i
think
a
larger
number
of
shippers
and
it
involves
more
clearly
the
general
issues
which
might
in
practical
terms
make
the
new
york
case
moot.
mr.
springer
just
in
the
interest
of
orderly
judicial
review,
this
would
frankly
be
a
judicial
construct
quite
analogous
to
what
the
hobbs
act
provides
with
respect
to
those
administrative
agencies.
mr.
springer
at
the
same
time
when
they're
overlapping
and
when
one
proceeding
might
well
resolve
all
of
the
issues
in
the
other
--
mr.
springer
yes,
it
certainly
could.
mr.
springer
yes,
but
i
think
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
--
mr.
springer
yes,
yes,
it
certainly
are
mr.
justice
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
abbot
laboratories,
there
are
remedies
for
this
kind
of
problem.
transfers
of
venue
under
section
1404
(a)
states
the
possibility
suggested
by
the
complaint
of
the
alabama
power
case
of
treating
this
cases
as
class
actions
so
that
we
think
that
it
is
appropriate
that
efforts
be
made
and
we
think
it's
feasible
to
confine
this
kind
of
general
review
that
we
would
allow
under
the
principles
we
suggest
in
a
single
three-judges
court
leaving
any
additional
matters
that
might
come
up
for
subsequent
litigation
perhaps
in
other
courts.
mr.
springer
yes,
as
i
think
as
mr.
o'malley
suggested,
there
is
the
aspect
of
latches
and
i
think
--
mr.
springer
well
the
other
protection
is
the
judgment
of
that
three-judge
court
that
it
should
not
--
mr.
springer
yes
and
the
court
--
mr.
springer
yes
and
these
are
equitable
proceedings
of
course
and
the
court
is
expected
to
exercise
its
deal
of
equitable
expression.
mr.
springer
yes
mr.
justice
and
in
fact
there
had
been
three
subsequent
increases
which
are
in
effect
in
whole
or
in
part
since
the
1968
proposal.
mr.
springer
about
the
additional
increases?
mr.
springer
well
those
rates
of
course
--
mr.
springer
no,
we
have
not
suggested
any
effort
to
undo
those
increases.
i
think
there
is
the
problem
of
interlocutory
relief
about
which
the
railroads
talk.
of
course
the
standards
for
such
interlocutory
judicial
pending
review
are
stringent
and
probably
in
the
ordinary
case
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
stay
such
an
enormous
broad
ranging
perpetrating
increases
as
are
involved
here.
thank
you.
mr.
springer
i
think
so
mr.
chief
justice
though
as
i
am
not
fully
familiar
with
this.
as
i
understand
the
particular
section
in
the
judicial
code
relating
to
multi
district
litigation,
i
believe
deals
only
with
discovery
and
doesn't
go
beyond
that
to
the
matter
of
trial.
but
this
is
a
multi
district
problem
very
much
likely
problems
giving
rise
to
that
committee
and
to
the
legislation
that's
now
in
the
books.
mr.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
three
distinct
federal
government
parties.
first
the
united
states
which
was
a
statutory
defendant
in
the
district
court
as
it
is
in
most
icc
review
proceedings.
second,
the
commission
itself
whose
order
is
in
question
and
third
the
secretary
of
agriculture
who
has
an
independent
statutory
responsibility
in
icc
proceedings
involving
rates
on
farm
products.
the
secretary
was
a
party
in
the
commission
proceedings
below
and
he
intervened
as
a
plaintiff
in
the
district
court
proceedings
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
that
is
the
alabama
power
case.
though
he
did
not
become
a
party,
as
the
secretary
in
the
atlantic
city
electric
case
which
was
subsequently
began
in
new
york.
because
of
their
differing
responsibilities,
these
three
federal
parties
have
taken
different
positions
on
the
merits
of
the
icc
order.
secretary
of
agriculture
generally
cites
but
the
plaintiffs
in
the
alabama
power
case.
the
commission
of
course
defends
its
order
on
the
merits
and
the
united
states
though
a
statutory
party
concluded
that
it
could
neither
support
nor
oppose
the
commission's
order
in
the
district
court
proceedings.
that
the
courts
below
did
not
reach
the
merits
and
so
we
submit
they
are
not
in
issue
here
since
the
courts
below
both
dismissed
the
complaints
before
them
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
state
a
claim
for
relief
that
is
a
claim
for
judicial
review.
so
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
threshold
question,
whether
the
commission's
order
was
reviewable,
is
reviewable
and
if
so
to
what
extent.
mr.
springer
as
to
that
i'm
just
going
to
say
mr.
justice
black
the
--
my
three
clients
are
substantially
in
agreement
on
that
which
is
why
i
think
i
can
appropriately
speak
for
all
of
them.
we
believe
that
the
alabama
power
case
complaint
in
the
columbia
district
court
does
state
a
claim
for
judicial
review
and
so
we
agree,
i
think
completely
with
mr.
mccarthy's
clients
in
that
case.
in
the
atlantic
city
electric
case
there
is
to
be
sure
a
relatively
minor
disagreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
commission
which
are
the
only
two
federal
parties
in
that
case
but
in
terms
of
the
relief
we
suggest
a
remand
of
that
case.
this
difference
becomes
of
relatively
little
importance.
both
the
united
states
and
the
commission
do
however
disagree
significantly
with
the
plaintiffs
in
the
atlantic
city
electric
case
as
i
shall
elaborate
in
a
minute.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
to
that
the
only
disagreement
among
any
of
the
parties
including
the
railroads
on
this
reviewability
question
is
a
disagreement
as
to
whether
the
various
aspects
of
the
general
revenue
order
have
sufficient
pragmatic
finality
to
make
review
appropriate
now
or
whether
on
the
other
hand,
review
should
be
differed
until
shippers
have
exhausted
further
administrative
remedies
of
challenging
particular
rates
by
complaints
under
section
13
of
the
act
which
the
commission
would
then
consider
under
section
151
after
the
rates
have
gone
into
effect.
we
think
that
it's
clear
from
both
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
the
city
of
chicago
case
and
more
particularly
on
this
issue
from
the
decision
several
years
ago
in
abbot
laboratories
against
gardner
that
this
is
the
only
question.
abbot
laboratories,
i
think
established
the
proposition
that
review
should
be
available
at
the
earlier
stage
at
which
the
agency
has
made
a
final
determination
and
a
controversy
as
to
the
validity
of
that
determination
has
rightly
as
to
the
existence
of
controversy.
i
think
there's
no
question
here.
the
shippers
are
paying
higher
rates
because
of
the
commission's
decisions
so
the
only
question
i
think
fairly
is
finality
which
as
the
court
again
indicated
in
abbot
laboratories,
there
is
a
pragmatic
question
based
upon
a
careful
analysis
of
what
the
agency
has
actually
done
and
what
kind
of
attack,
the
parties
seeking
review
are
making
upon
what
the
agency
is
done.
so
that
i
think
i
should
proceed
now
to
review
once
again
and
perhaps
from
a
somewhat
different
aspect.
the
issues
that
were
before
the
commission
in
this
general
revenue
proceeding
and
what
the
commission
did
with
those
issues.
the
general
revenue
proceeding
is
an
investigation
under
section
157
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
generally
permits
the
commission
to
make
a
final
determination
in
advance
of
the
effectiveness
of
new
rates
as
to
whether
those
rates
are
lawful
or
not.
section
157
explicitly
permits
the
commission
to
do
an
advance.
everything
that
it
could
do
after
the
effectiveness
of
new
rates
under
section
151
and
the
151
proceeding
could
be
either
on
the
commission's
own
motion
or
in
response
to
a
complaint
by
shipper
under
section
13.
both
therefore
--
both
of
these
subsections
contemplate
that
the
commission
will
make
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
that
is
it
will
determine
whether
the
rates
are
just
unreasonable
and
further
whether
they
are
called
unjustly
discriminatory
or
unduly
preferential
or
prejudicial
and
section
1582
expands
upon
just
and
reasonable
standard,
so
that
that
inquiry
in
substance
includes
two
questions.
first,
what
are
the
railroads
revenue
needs
if
they
are
to
provide
adequate
and
efficient
service
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
with
the
furnishing
of
such
service
and
under
honest
economical
and
efficient
management.
and
the
second
question
under
the
just
and
reasonable
rubric
is
what
effect
will
an
increase
in
whatever
rates
are
in
question
have
upon
the
movement
of
traffic,
more
particularly
will
they
--
will
such
an
increase
divert
traffic
from
the
rail
carriage
to
such
an
extent
as
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
increase.
now
when
all
the
rail
roads
in
the
country
want
to
as
they
did
here
and
as
they
have
previously
and
subsequently
want
to
increase
all
of
their
freight
rates
to
compensate
for
increased
costs.
it's
obvious
that
the
commission
cannot
feasibly
make
all
of
these
determinations
within
the
seven
month
suspension
period
that
is
allowed
under
section
157
before
the
new
rates
can
be
allowed
to
come
into
effect.
and
of
course
the
railroads
claim
and
the
commission
has
to
give
effect
to
their
claim
that
they
have
an
urgent
need
for
an
increase
when
this
kind
of
situation
comes
up.
on
the
other
hand
the
commission
frequently
concludes
as
it
did
here
that
it
should
not
allow
the
railroads
to
increase
their
rates
generally
without
some
prior
investigation.
in
consequence,
many
years
ago
the
commission
developed
the
general
revenue
proceeding
which
is
a
limited
kind
of
section
157
proceeding
in
which
the
commission
generally
examines
the
proposed
across
the
board
tariff
increases
but
expressly
refrains
from
determining
the
lawfulness
of
each
and
every
rate
that
would
be
increased.
mr.
springer
that's
true
mr.
justice
white.
what
it
does
it
--
and
i
will
elaborate
on
this,
it
gives
a
kind
of
--.
it
may
determine
as
to
some
rates
that
they
are
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
therefore
should
be
lowered
and
in
fact
they
did
that
in
a
limited
number
of
instances
in
this
case
but
it
does
not
exhaustively
look
at
each
and
every
grade
under
--
mr.
springer
yes,
well
in
a
nutshell,
i
don't
think
any
of
them
are
necessarily
legally
foreclosed.
however
as
to
the
general
revenue
needs
question,
practically
they
are
foreclosed.
mr.
springer
not
as
a
matter
of
strict
law,
practically
speaking
though
as
to
the
general
revenue
needs
question
that
is
a
question
which
we
agree
with
the
alabama
power
plaintiffs
has
been
thoroughly
considered
and
thoroughly
decided
by
the
commission.
mr.
springer
no,
it
is
a
matter,
i
suppose
of
stare
decisis
as
to
--
mr.
springer
yes
but
in
the
pragmatic
terms
in
which
we're
talking,
that
subsequent
court
review
of
this
question
would
be
in
no
way,
no
realistic
way
aided
by
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
additional
agency
proceeding
in
the
interim
as
to
the
general
revenue
needs
question.
mr.
springer
yes,
and
now
as
to
other
issues
--
mr.
springer
yes.
mr.
springer
as
to
that
rate
except
to
that
--
mr.
springer
yes.
that
certainly
could
be
done
but
our
position
basically
as
to
the
general
revenue
proceeding
is
that
since
the
court
should
review
as
soon
as
it
can,
as
soon
as
there
is
sufficient
administrative
finality,
it
should
not
be
required
to
wait,
it
might
wait
but
it
would
be
better
policy
and
it's
not
necessary
to
wait
as
to
the
issues
that
have
been
finally
decided
in
the
general
proceedings
though
i
agree
it
would
be
possible
for
the
court
to
review
it
later
on.
mr.
springer
yes,
and
frankly
the
time
table
of
this
proceeding
was
dictated
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
suspended
the
rates.
it's
allowed
under
the
statute
to
suspend
only
for
seven
months.
the
commission's
decision
came,
final
order
came
down,
i
think
six-and-a-half
months
or
perhaps
a
little
more
after
the
proceeding
had
began
and
at
that
point
the
--
mr.
springer
yes,
by
instituting
a
new
proceeding
which
of
course
would
take
some
time
and
it
might
be
a
year
or
two
later
by
the
time
judicial
review
could
be
had
as
to
that.
mr.
springer
that's
what
the
language
in
that
opinion.
i
would
not
want
to
--
i
don't
think
the
commission
would
want
me
to
hang
too
much
on
the
relatively
brief
language
in
that
opinion.
mr.
springer
yes.
mr.
springer
and
as
to
the
general
revenue.
mr.
springer
yes
and
as
to
the
general
revenue
findings,
the
only
thing
it
could
do
in
such
a
further
proceeding
would
be
a
kind
of
reconsideration
of
what
it
had
already
decided
for.
mr.
springer
yes,
it's
true
in
that
case
though
again
it's
--
i
think
i
do
have
honestly
i
have
to
say
that
that
does
not
reflect
a
fully
fleshed
out
and
thought
out
commission
consideration
of
exactly
the
kind
of
problem
that
we
have
here.
and
of
course,
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
that
the
fact
that
reconsideration
by
the
administrative
agency
is
available
does
not
preclude
judicial
review
before
such
reconsideration.
so
that
we
agree
that
as
to
the
general
revenue
questions,
which
are
essential
underpinnings
of
the
great
increase,
if
the
commission
had
disagreed
with
the
railroads
submissions
that
they
needed
more
revenue,
the
commission
would
have
not
allowed
the
increase.
so
that's
an
essential
condition
to
the
increase,
one
that
the
commission
considered
separately,
considered
finally
to
the
extent
if
at
all
there
are
any
further
administrative
proceedings
possible
as
to
that
issue.
they're
only
in
the
nature
for
reconsideration
and
the
availability
of
such
reconsideration
if
there
is
such
availability
is
not
a
part
to
judicial
review.
this
brings
me
then
to
the
other
issues.
the
issues
with
which
at
least
in
large
part,
the
new
york
plaintiffs
are
concerned
having
concluded
that
the
railroads
revenue
needs
justified
an
increase
to
a
certain
average
level.
the
commission
went
on
to
consider
the
propriety
of
the
allocation
of
the
additional
revenues
among
various
shippers
and
various
commodities.
in
particular,
it
had
to
consider
or
that
section
151
and
7
contemplate
that
it
would
consider
whether
the
rates
would
have
adverse
effects
on
the
movement
of
traffic,
that
is
diversion
and
whether
the
rates
are
discriminatory
or
preferential.
here
the
question
is
not
what
the
railroads
need
but
what
individual
shippers
and
shipping
various
things
in
various
places
are
willing
to
pay
rather
than
decide
not
to
ship
by
rail
and
what
they
can
fairly
be
required
to
pay
considering
the
relationships
among
the
various
rates
and
other
matters.
as
i
say
the
commission
has
given
some
consideration
to
these
matters
and
the
general
revenue
proceeding
and
it
did
throw
out
a
relatively
small
number
of
the
particular
rates
because
of
defects
that
became
apparent
to
the
commission.
and
it's
kind
of
preliminary
once
over
on
these
detailed
rate
by
rate
or
rate
group
by
rate
group
issues.
but
it
certainly
did
not
conclude
exhaustively
that
no
rate
might
have
such
a
defect
and
therefore
expressly
left
open
as
it
does
in
these
general
rate
proceedings.
left
it
open
for
shippers
to
institute
subsequent
proceedings
by
complaints
under
section
13
which
could
result
in
section
151
proceedings
to
attack
particular
rates
of
interest
to
them.
specifically
with
reference
to
this
court's
decision
many
years
ago
in
the
arizona
grocery
case,
the
commission
said
that
we
are
not
hereby
prescribing
all
of
the
rates
which
we
are
in
this
kind
of
limited
proceeding
allowing
the
railroads
to
increase
generally.
so
that
we
think
that
the
complaint
in
the
atlantic
city
case
is
in
large
measure
an
attack
on
this
second
aspect
of
the
general
revenue
proceeding
that
the
commission
had
it
once
over
on
particular
rates
and
this
are
matters
which
while
the
commission
has
considered
them,
it
has
not
considered
them
finally
and
could
not
on
the
record
that
the
commission
had
before
it
and
could
have
it
before
it
and
a
proceeding
under
the
kind
of
time
pressures
if
there
are
in
a
general
revenue
proceedings.
in
short,
these
shippers
have
not
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies
and
we
think
that
judicial
review
should
not
be
available.
as
i
indicated
there
is
a
minor
disagreement
in
framework
--
in
the
terms
of
the
framework
of
this
case
between
the
commission
and
the
united
states.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
not
being
a
party
in
this
case.
the
united
states
believes
that
the
atlantic
city
complaints
can
be
read
perhaps
as
raising
an
attack
on
the
general
revenue
needs
findings
and
perhaps
also
as
raising
an
attack
upon
the
general
nature
of
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
the
commission
has
had.
that
of
course
is
--
the
commission
has
finally
decided
what
kind
of
proceeding
it's
going
to
have.
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
shippers
may
want
to
raise
the
question
whether
the
commission
can
have
a
general
revenue
proceeding
without
finally
determining
all
of
the
multitude
of
rates
involved.
that
theoretically
at
least
is
a
question
that
is
right
for
judicial
review
after
the
general
review
proceeding
is
over.
but
the
commission
of
united
states
does
agree
that
under
all
the
circumstances
as
to
the
new
york
case,
it
is
appropriate
to
remand
that
case
so
that
the
parties
can
amend
their
--
plaintiffs
can
amend
complaints
if
they
wish
and
that
the
district
court
can
shape
the
litigation
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
that
we
have
suggested.
let
me
say
a
further
word
about
relief
--
mr.
springer
yes,
completely
in
sympathy
in
the
alabama
power
case
which
was
the
case
he
was
focusing
on.
mr.
springer
yes
he
did.
a
problem
with
the
atlantic
city
case
is
that
that
district
court
in
new
york
seems
to
have
read
the
complaint
as
having
the
generality
that
what
we
believe
the
alabama
power
complaint
has
and
dismissing
it
on
the
same
theory
that
the
majority
of
the
district
court
and
the
district
of
columbia
dismissed
the
complaint
there
and
i
think
they
have
improperly
read
the
complaint
and
also
reached
and
in
terms
of
that
judgment
--
in
terms
of
that
reading
made
an
improper
judgment.
there
is
the
problem
to
which
mr.
justice
stewart
has
adverted
a
multiple
district
court
proceedings
and
matters
of
this
kind.
accordingly,
we
would
suggest
that
in
this
case,
the
new
york
court
might
well
be
instructed
to
stay
its
hand
until
the
district
court
proceeding
and
the
district
of
columbia
is
completed.
that
case
was
filed
first,
it
involves
i
think
a
larger
number
of
shippers
and
it
involves
more
clearly
the
general
issues
which
might
in
practical
terms
make
the
new
york
case
moot.
mr.
springer
just
in
the
interest
of
orderly
judicial
review,
this
would
frankly
be
a
judicial
construct
quite
analogous
to
what
the
hobbs
act
provides
with
respect
to
those
administrative
agencies.
mr.
springer
at
the
same
time
when
they're
overlapping
and
when
one
proceeding
might
well
resolve
all
of
the
issues
in
the
other
--
mr.
springer
yes,
it
certainly
could.
mr.
springer
yes,
but
i
think
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
--
mr.
springer
yes,
yes,
it
certainly
are
mr.
justice
but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
abbot
laboratories,
there
are
remedies
for
this
kind
of
problem.
transfers
of
venue
under
section
1404
(a)
states
the
possibility
suggested
by
the
complaint
of
the
alabama
power
case
of
treating
this
cases
as
class
actions
so
that
we
think
that
it
is
appropriate
that
efforts
be
made
and
we
think
it's
feasible
to
confine
this
kind
of
general
review
that
we
would
allow
under
the
principles
we
suggest
in
a
single
three-judges
court
leaving
any
additional
matters
that
might
come
up
for
subsequent
litigation
perhaps
in
other
courts.
mr.
springer
yes,
as
i
think
as
mr.
o'malley
suggested,
there
is
the
aspect
of
latches
and
i
think
--
mr.
springer
well
the
other
protection
is
the
judgment
of
that
three-judge
court
that
it
should
not
--
mr.
springer
yes
and
the
court
--
mr.
springer
yes
and
these
are
equitable
proceedings
of
course
and
the
court
is
expected
to
exercise
its
deal
of
equitable
expression.
mr.
springer
yes
mr.
justice
and
in
fact
there
had
been
three
subsequent
increases
which
are
in
effect
in
whole
or
in
part
since
the
1968
proposal.
mr.
springer
about
the
additional
increases?
mr.
springer
well
those
rates
of
course
--
mr.
springer
no,
we
have
not
suggested
any
effort
to
undo
those
increases.
i
think
there
is
the
problem
of
interlocutory
relief
about
which
the
railroads
talk.
of
course
the
standards
for
such
interlocutory
judicial
pending
review
are
stringent
and
probably
in
the
ordinary
case
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
stay
such
an
enormous
broad
ranging
perpetrating
increases
as
are
involved
here.
thank
you.
mr.
springer
i
think
so
mr.
chief
justice
though
as
i
am
not
fully
familiar
with
this.
as
i
understand
the
particular
section
in
the
judicial
code
relating
to
multi
district
litigation,
i
believe
deals
only
with
discovery
and
doesn't
go
beyond
that
to
the
matter
of
trial.
but
this
is
a
multi
district
problem
very
much
likely
problems
giving
rise
to
that
committee
and
to
the
legislation
that's
now
in
the
books.
