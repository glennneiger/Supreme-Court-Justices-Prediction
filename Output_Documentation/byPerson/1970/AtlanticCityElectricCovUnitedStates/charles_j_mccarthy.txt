mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
reviewability
of
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
authorizes
the
nation's
railroads
to
raise
their
freight
rates
an
average
of
5%
or
nearly
a
half
billion
dollars
a
year.
i
think
it's
important
to
have
in
mind
just
how
this
case
arose.
the
usual
procedure
followed
by
a
railroad
when
it
wishes
to
change
a
rate
is
to
file
the
new
rate
with
the
commission,
30
days
before
its
effective
date.
during
that
30
day
period,
the
rate
is
subject
to
protest
and
to
suspension
and
investigation.
if
the
commission
determines
not
to
suspend
or
investigate,
the
rate
goes
into
effect,
the
commission's
action
is
discretionary,
not
reviewable
and
one
who
wishes
to
complain
of
the
rate
must
file
a
formal
complaint.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
commission
decides
to
investigate
the
final
order
in
the
investigation
proceeding
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
in
a
general
increase
case,
the
procedures
that
must
be
followed
are
a
little
different.
there
are
three
reasons
for
this.
there
are
outstanding
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
prescribe
rates.
those
rates
can't
be
changed
without
commission
authorization.
then
in
every
general
increase,
situations
arise
in
which
there
is
a
lesser
rate
for
a
longer
distance
that
applies
for
a
shorter
distance
included
within
the
longer,
and
that
of
course
is
a
violation
of
section
4
of
the
act,
unless
the
commission
authorizes.
finally
there's
the
mechanical
problem.
it's
just
not
feasible
to
file
increases
in
all
the
myriad
railroad
rates.
in
a
preferred
procedure
is
to
file
a
master
tariff
which
includes
all
the
increases
and
what
are
known
as
connecting
link
supplements.
these
are
supplements
in
each
individual
tariff
which
simply
say
that
all
of
the
rates
in
this
tariff
are
subject
to
the
increases
in
master
tariff.
the
commission's
tariff
filing
rules
don't
permit
that
so
in
order
to
follow
that
procedure,
it's
necessary
to
get
authority
to
depart
from
those
rules.
the
proceeding
of
which
we
seek
review
was
initiated
by
the
railroads
by
filing
a
petition
asking
for
all
three
of
these
forms
of
relief.
the
commission
immediately
granted
the
tariff
filing
authority
requested
and
it
modified
outstanding
orders
and
granted
fourth
section
relief,
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
permit
the
tariffs
to
be
filed.
at
this
point,
the
situation
is
similar
to
what
it
would
have
been
had
no
such
authority
been
required.
the
rates
are
filed,
they're
subject
to
protest;
they're
subject
to
investigation
and
suspension.
there
is
one
major
difference
though.
that
is
that
the
railroad
--
that
the
commission
could
not
at
this
point,
simply
say
we
won't
investigate
and
that
the
rates
going
to
affect
because
the
commission
has
--
or
the
railroads
have
an
obligation
to
get
a
modification
of
outstanding
orders
and
fourth
section
relief
before
they
can
legally
put
these
rates
into
effect.
and
that's
recognized
by
the
railroads
in
their
petition.
they
ask
that
the
rates
be
authorized
only
after
hearing
and
after
a
finding
at
the
general
level
will
not
be
more
and
is
just
unreasonable.
the
rates
were
protested.
the
commission
did
suspend
and
the
commission
did
initiate
an
investigation.
at
the
same
time,
it
authorized
the
railroads
to
put
into
effect
a
3%
increase
subject
to
investigation.
that
3%
increase
isn't
involved
here.
i
mentioned
that
just
in
the
interest
of
completeness.
the
subsequent
investigation
was
extensive.
the
commission
divided
the
case
into
10
sub
proceedings
to
one,
it
assigned
the
question
of
revenue
needs
to
the
other
9,
it
assigned
various
commodities
and
services.
at
the
end
of
the
revenue
--
end
of
the
hearing
in
the
revenue
sub
proceeding,
the
commission
ended
its
order
of
november
25th
in
which
it
authorized
the
railroads
to
put
in
all
of
the
increases
they
had
proposed
with
some
minor
exceptions
subject
to
possible
change
as
a
result
of
the
final
outcome
of
the
other
9
sub
proceedings.
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
hearings,
the
commission
ended
its
order
of
january
9.
that
order
authorizes
the
railroads
to
put
the
increases
in
effect.
it
orders
them
to
cease
and
desist
from
charging
any
higher
increases.
it
finds
that
the
rates
will
not
exceed
a
just
and
reasonable
maximum
on
a
general
basis.
it
modifies
all
outstanding
orders
of
the
commission
and
grants
fourth
section
relief
to
the
extent
necessary
to
make
these
increases
lawful.
and
finally
the
order
says
the
proceeding
is
discontinued.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
last
step
in
this
general
increase
case.
the
plaintiffs
in
number
106
are
shippers
or
associations
of
shippers
who
pay
more
than
20%
of
the
nation's
freight
bill.
and
the
action
was
filed
as
a
class
action
in
behalf
of
all
shippers.
in
every
general
increase
case,
i
don't
care
whether
it's
a
railroad
or
what
kind
of
utility
it
is.
there
are
two
basic
questions.
one,
what
increase
if
any
should
be
authorized?
how
much
more
money
should
be
provided
by
an
increase
in
rates?
and
the
second
question
is,
how
are
we
going
to
spread
that
increase
out
over
the
various
services
that
this
utility
performs.
our
complaint
goes
to
the
first
issue.
we
say
that
the
commission
did
not
apply
the
rate
making
standards
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
that
if
it
had
applied
them,
it
could
not
have
authorized
this
increase
on
the
present
record.
we
also
say
that
the
commission
should
have
looked
at
the
needs
of
the
railroads
in
each
of
the
main
regions
of
the
country,
rather
than
just
a
general
overall
increase,
and
we
say
that
the
commission
should
have
looked
at
types
of
traffic
by
broad
categories.
we
do
not
say
that
the
increase
makes
any
specific
rate
unreasonable.
the
controlling
principle
as
we
see
it,
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
reviewability
of
an
agency
order.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
an
order
will
not
be
held
to
be
non-reviewable,
unless
there
is
persuasive
reason
to
believe
that
congress
so
intended.
the
railroads
point
to
nothing
even
remotely
suggesting
that
congress
intended
to
accept
general
increase
orders
from
the
broad
statutory
authorization
that
it
has
given
the
review
orders
of
interstate
commerce
commission
and
to
review
rate
orders
generally
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
railroads
basically
make
two
arguments.
they
say
we
haven't
exhausted
our
administrative
remedy.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
surely
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
it
is
a
creature
of
the
commission.
the
act
provides
two
sections
under
which
proceedings
can
be
instituted.
if
a
raid
has
not
gone
into
effect,
the
investigation
is
under
157,
if
it
has,
then
the
shipper
has
to
file
a
complaint
under
section
13.
this
is
just
a
section
157
proceeding
but
it
is
necessary
for
the
commission
to
grant
the
specific
authorization
because
of
its
outstanding
orders
relief
from
tariff
filing
in
the
fourth
section
relief.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
well
your
honor,
this
is
a
proceeding
which
follows
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
commission
is
proceeding
under
the
authority
granted
by
section
157
of
the
act.
so
the
particular
way
that
the
commission
proceeds
in
this
case
is
a
matter
of
administrative
decision
perhaps.
but
the
authority
to
proceed
and
the
basic
procedure
is
all
pursuant
to
section
157
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
there
is
a
specific
review
provision
section
1336
of
title
28
which
says
that
all
others
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
subject
to
review
in
the
courts.
court
please,
i
think
of
the
general
level
of
freight
rates
as
being
a
horizontal
line
and
the
individual
rates
are
dots.
some
of
them
are
above
that
line
and
some
of
them
are
below.
and
the
average
height
of
all
those
dots
is
the
same
height
as
that
horizontal
line.
now
suppose,
we
raise
that
line
5%,
if
all
of
the
rates
are
raised
proportionately,
the
relationship
of
each
rate
to
that
new
line
is
the
same
as
its
relationship
to
the
old
line
was.
the
railroads
say
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
commission
before
we
can
have
review
of
the
order
raising
that
horizontal
line
and
file
complaints
on
the
million
or
so
rates
in
which
we
are
interested.
what
would
the
issue
be
in
such
a
proceeding,
when
the
lawfulness
of
an
individual
rate
is
challenged,
the
question
is,
how
it
is
related
to
the
general
level
of
reasonableness.
it
doesn't
involve
the
question
of
where
the
general
level
of
reasonableness
is.
now
we
are
not
challenging
the
relationship
of
individual
rates
to
that
general
level.
so
if
we
followed
the
railroad
suggestion
and
went
back
to
the
commission
where
these
thousands
or
millions
of
cases,
we
would
have
to
say
to
the
commission,
we
do
not
challenge
the
relationship
of
any
of
these
rates
to
the
new
level
that
you
have
set,
all
we
want
to
challenge
is
what
is
that
level
which
you
have
just
set
in
a
proceeding
that
has
just
been
terminated.
now,
that
is
the
administrative
procedure
that
the
railroads
say
“we
haven't
exhausted
it.”
what
the
railroads
are
really
saying
is
that
shippers
have
no
interest
in
the
general
level
of
freight
rates,
no
legal
interest.
they
certainly
have
a
tremendous
practical
interest.
it's
more
important
to
a
shipper
to
have
his
rates
raised
5%
across
the
board
than
it
is
to
have
one
individual
rate
raised
or
to
have
one
individual
rate
that
he
thinks
is
a
little
bit
too
high
and
wouldn't
it
be
a
little
anomalous
to
say
that
he
can
have
court
review
where
his
interests
are
affected
to
a
minor
degree
and
can't
have
court
review,
if
his
interests
are
affected
to
a
major
degree.
now
that
brings
me
to
the
policy
question,
the
railroads
argue
that
this
court
should
deny
relief
because
some
district
court
might
improvidently
grant
interlocutory
relief
to
a
shipper,
to
the
railroads
detriment.
from
my
experience,
i
think
that
danger
is
greatly
exaggerated
but
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
the
district
court
might
act
improvidently.
but
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
safeguards
that
attach
to
interlocutory
relief
are
not
sufficient
in
a
general
increase
case,
then
the
thing
to
do
is
to
shore
up
those
safeguards.
it's
not
to
deny
judicial
review.
you
don't
throw
out
the
baby
with
the
bath
water.
in
a
second
place
when
congress
authorized
review
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders,
it
knew
then
interlocutory
relief
would
be
granted
in
cases
which
the
courts
think
are
appropriate.
if
the
safeguards
and
interlocutory
relief
are
not
sufficient,
the
railroads
ought
to
be
talking
to
the
congress
and
not
to
this
court.
and
while
we‘re
on
the
field
of
public
policy,
i
would
just
like
to
remind
the
court
that
there
are
two
sides
to
every
coin.
and
we
think
that
the
policy
reasons
for
judicial
review
vastly
out
weigh
any
on
the
other
side.
if
an
agency
is
insulated
from
judicial
review,
there
is
always
the
risk
that
there
are
handling
of
cases
of
this
kind
may
become
perfunctory.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
i
am
stating
exactly
that
your
honor.
there
is
no
revenue
of
review.
this
is
where
the
review
stops,
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
get
review
of
what
the
commission
did
in
this
general
increased
proceeding
unless
we
get
it
by
a
direct
review.
if
we
go
back
to
the
commission
challenging
--
we
would
have
to
challenge
every
rate
across
the
board
because
we're
interested
in
every
rate
and
we
say
to
the
commission,
we
are
raising
no
question
about
where
this
particular
rate
stands
in
relation
to
this
new
level
of
rates.
in
this
new
level
of
reasonableness
that
you've
established
and
we
want
to
re-litigate
everything
that
you
did
in
259.
the
commission
very
properly
is
going
to
say
“this
isn't
the
forum
to
do
it
and
that
is
you
would
settle
it”
and
wouldn't
it
be
a
monstrous
administrative
procedure
to
say
that
you
retail
this
old
ground
in
all
of
these
individual
cases
after
the
commission
has
spent
months
and
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
and
arguments
and
briefs
resolving
this
specific
question.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
if
the
court
please,
this
effort
to
equate
suspension
with
the
order
in
this
case
is
pretty
far
fetched.
suspension
is
something
an
order
not
to
suspend
is
an
order
which
the
commission
makes
without
any
record
on
a
basis
of
a
casual
observation
of
the
contentions
of
the
parties.
here,
we
have
an
order
made
after
extensive
hearings
and
on
the
basis
of
detailed
findings.
that's
the
distinction
between
a
suspension
order
and
this
type
of
order.
the
suspension
order
is
discretionary
and
that's
the
reason
it's
not
reviewable.
now
the
mere
fact
that
an
order
doesn't
finally
fix
the
lawfulness
of
rates
does
not
stop
it
from
being
reviewable.
in
both
interstate
--
well,
the
mcclain
case
and
the
waterways
case,
the
orders
there
involved
did
not
finally
fix
the
lawfulness
of
rates.
the
court
commented
that
the
rates
were
still
subject
to
reparation
but
there
was
no
question
about
them
being
reviewable.
finally,
i
don't
think
i
have
been
able
to
make
myself
clear
as
to
the
relationship
between
a
general
level
of
rates
and
a
particular
rate.
when
the
commission
fixes
this
general
level
and
i
go
back
in
with
a
complaint
against
a
particular
rate.
that
general
level
is
a
standard
against
which
my
rate
is
measured.
i
don't
get
a
chance
to
litigate
that
question
again.
and
if
i
am
raising
no
question
as
i
am
about
how
a
particular
rate
should
be
related
to
that
general
level,
i
have
nothing
to
go
back
to
the
commission
with.
it's
a
waste
of
my
time,
a
waste
of
the
commission's
time.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
no
your
honor,
because
we
have
here
an
order
modifying
outstanding
orders.
we
have
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
shippers.
the
railroads
concede
that
there
are
such
outstanding
orders.
it
concedes
that
fourth
section
relief
is
necessary.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
well
it's
--
except
for
that
point
there.
i
think
we
can
win
either
on
the
basis
that
we
have
no
administrative
remedy
and
we
don't.
all
we
can
win
on
the
basis
that
there
is
an
order
setting,
modifying
outstanding
orders
and
granting
fourth
section
relief
which
cannot
be
done
without
a
hearing.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
reviewability
of
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
authorizes
the
nation's
railroads
to
raise
their
freight
rates
an
average
of
5%
or
nearly
a
half
billion
dollars
a
year.
i
think
it's
important
to
have
in
mind
just
how
this
case
arose.
the
usual
procedure
followed
by
a
railroad
when
it
wishes
to
change
a
rate
is
to
file
the
new
rate
with
the
commission,
30
days
before
its
effective
date.
during
that
30
day
period,
the
rate
is
subject
to
protest
and
to
suspension
and
investigation.
if
the
commission
determines
not
to
suspend
or
investigate,
the
rate
goes
into
effect,
the
commission's
action
is
discretionary,
not
reviewable
and
one
who
wishes
to
complain
of
the
rate
must
file
a
formal
complaint.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
commission
decides
to
investigate
the
final
order
in
the
investigation
proceeding
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
in
a
general
increase
case,
the
procedures
that
must
be
followed
are
a
little
different.
there
are
three
reasons
for
this.
there
are
outstanding
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
prescribe
rates.
those
rates
can't
be
changed
without
commission
authorization.
then
in
every
general
increase,
situations
arise
in
which
there
is
a
lesser
rate
for
a
longer
distance
that
applies
for
a
shorter
distance
included
within
the
longer,
and
that
of
course
is
a
violation
of
section
4
of
the
act,
unless
the
commission
authorizes.
finally
there's
the
mechanical
problem.
it's
just
not
feasible
to
file
increases
in
all
the
myriad
railroad
rates.
in
a
preferred
procedure
is
to
file
a
master
tariff
which
includes
all
the
increases
and
what
are
known
as
connecting
link
supplements.
these
are
supplements
in
each
individual
tariff
which
simply
say
that
all
of
the
rates
in
this
tariff
are
subject
to
the
increases
in
master
tariff.
the
commission's
tariff
filing
rules
don't
permit
that
so
in
order
to
follow
that
procedure,
it's
necessary
to
get
authority
to
depart
from
those
rules.
the
proceeding
of
which
we
seek
review
was
initiated
by
the
railroads
by
filing
a
petition
asking
for
all
three
of
these
forms
of
relief.
the
commission
immediately
granted
the
tariff
filing
authority
requested
and
it
modified
outstanding
orders
and
granted
fourth
section
relief,
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
permit
the
tariffs
to
be
filed.
at
this
point,
the
situation
is
similar
to
what
it
would
have
been
had
no
such
authority
been
required.
the
rates
are
filed,
they're
subject
to
protest;
they're
subject
to
investigation
and
suspension.
there
is
one
major
difference
though.
that
is
that
the
railroad
--
that
the
commission
could
not
at
this
point,
simply
say
we
won't
investigate
and
that
the
rates
going
to
affect
because
the
commission
has
--
or
the
railroads
have
an
obligation
to
get
a
modification
of
outstanding
orders
and
fourth
section
relief
before
they
can
legally
put
these
rates
into
effect.
and
that's
recognized
by
the
railroads
in
their
petition.
they
ask
that
the
rates
be
authorized
only
after
hearing
and
after
a
finding
at
the
general
level
will
not
be
more
and
is
just
unreasonable.
the
rates
were
protested.
the
commission
did
suspend
and
the
commission
did
initiate
an
investigation.
at
the
same
time,
it
authorized
the
railroads
to
put
into
effect
a
3%
increase
subject
to
investigation.
that
3%
increase
isn't
involved
here.
i
mentioned
that
just
in
the
interest
of
completeness.
the
subsequent
investigation
was
extensive.
the
commission
divided
the
case
into
10
sub
proceedings
to
one,
it
assigned
the
question
of
revenue
needs
to
the
other
9,
it
assigned
various
commodities
and
services.
at
the
end
of
the
revenue
--
end
of
the
hearing
in
the
revenue
sub
proceeding,
the
commission
ended
its
order
of
november
25th
in
which
it
authorized
the
railroads
to
put
in
all
of
the
increases
they
had
proposed
with
some
minor
exceptions
subject
to
possible
change
as
a
result
of
the
final
outcome
of
the
other
9
sub
proceedings.
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
hearings,
the
commission
ended
its
order
of
january
9.
that
order
authorizes
the
railroads
to
put
the
increases
in
effect.
it
orders
them
to
cease
and
desist
from
charging
any
higher
increases.
it
finds
that
the
rates
will
not
exceed
a
just
and
reasonable
maximum
on
a
general
basis.
it
modifies
all
outstanding
orders
of
the
commission
and
grants
fourth
section
relief
to
the
extent
necessary
to
make
these
increases
lawful.
and
finally
the
order
says
the
proceeding
is
discontinued.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
last
step
in
this
general
increase
case.
the
plaintiffs
in
number
106
are
shippers
or
associations
of
shippers
who
pay
more
than
20%
of
the
nation's
freight
bill.
and
the
action
was
filed
as
a
class
action
in
behalf
of
all
shippers.
in
every
general
increase
case,
i
don't
care
whether
it's
a
railroad
or
what
kind
of
utility
it
is.
there
are
two
basic
questions.
one,
what
increase
if
any
should
be
authorized?
how
much
more
money
should
be
provided
by
an
increase
in
rates?
and
the
second
question
is,
how
are
we
going
to
spread
that
increase
out
over
the
various
services
that
this
utility
performs.
our
complaint
goes
to
the
first
issue.
we
say
that
the
commission
did
not
apply
the
rate
making
standards
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
that
if
it
had
applied
them,
it
could
not
have
authorized
this
increase
on
the
present
record.
we
also
say
that
the
commission
should
have
looked
at
the
needs
of
the
railroads
in
each
of
the
main
regions
of
the
country,
rather
than
just
a
general
overall
increase,
and
we
say
that
the
commission
should
have
looked
at
types
of
traffic
by
broad
categories.
we
do
not
say
that
the
increase
makes
any
specific
rate
unreasonable.
the
controlling
principle
as
we
see
it,
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
reviewability
of
an
agency
order.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
an
order
will
not
be
held
to
be
non-reviewable,
unless
there
is
persuasive
reason
to
believe
that
congress
so
intended.
the
railroads
point
to
nothing
even
remotely
suggesting
that
congress
intended
to
accept
general
increase
orders
from
the
broad
statutory
authorization
that
it
has
given
the
review
orders
of
interstate
commerce
commission
and
to
review
rate
orders
generally
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
railroads
basically
make
two
arguments.
they
say
we
haven't
exhausted
our
administrative
remedy.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
surely
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
it
is
a
creature
of
the
commission.
the
act
provides
two
sections
under
which
proceedings
can
be
instituted.
if
a
raid
has
not
gone
into
effect,
the
investigation
is
under
157,
if
it
has,
then
the
shipper
has
to
file
a
complaint
under
section
13.
this
is
just
a
section
157
proceeding
but
it
is
necessary
for
the
commission
to
grant
the
specific
authorization
because
of
its
outstanding
orders
relief
from
tariff
filing
in
the
fourth
section
relief.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
well
your
honor,
this
is
a
proceeding
which
follows
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
commission
is
proceeding
under
the
authority
granted
by
section
157
of
the
act.
so
the
particular
way
that
the
commission
proceeds
in
this
case
is
a
matter
of
administrative
decision
perhaps.
but
the
authority
to
proceed
and
the
basic
procedure
is
all
pursuant
to
section
157
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
there
is
a
specific
review
provision
section
1336
of
title
28
which
says
that
all
others
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
subject
to
review
in
the
courts.
court
please,
i
think
of
the
general
level
of
freight
rates
as
being
a
horizontal
line
and
the
individual
rates
are
dots.
some
of
them
are
above
that
line
and
some
of
them
are
below.
and
the
average
height
of
all
those
dots
is
the
same
height
as
that
horizontal
line.
now
suppose,
we
raise
that
line
5%,
if
all
of
the
rates
are
raised
proportionately,
the
relationship
of
each
rate
to
that
new
line
is
the
same
as
its
relationship
to
the
old
line
was.
the
railroads
say
we
need
to
go
back
to
the
commission
before
we
can
have
review
of
the
order
raising
that
horizontal
line
and
file
complaints
on
the
million
or
so
rates
in
which
we
are
interested.
what
would
the
issue
be
in
such
a
proceeding,
when
the
lawfulness
of
an
individual
rate
is
challenged,
the
question
is,
how
it
is
related
to
the
general
level
of
reasonableness.
it
doesn't
involve
the
question
of
where
the
general
level
of
reasonableness
is.
now
we
are
not
challenging
the
relationship
of
individual
rates
to
that
general
level.
so
if
we
followed
the
railroad
suggestion
and
went
back
to
the
commission
where
these
thousands
or
millions
of
cases,
we
would
have
to
say
to
the
commission,
we
do
not
challenge
the
relationship
of
any
of
these
rates
to
the
new
level
that
you
have
set,
all
we
want
to
challenge
is
what
is
that
level
which
you
have
just
set
in
a
proceeding
that
has
just
been
terminated.
now,
that
is
the
administrative
procedure
that
the
railroads
say
“we
haven't
exhausted
it.”
what
the
railroads
are
really
saying
is
that
shippers
have
no
interest
in
the
general
level
of
freight
rates,
no
legal
interest.
they
certainly
have
a
tremendous
practical
interest.
it's
more
important
to
a
shipper
to
have
his
rates
raised
5%
across
the
board
than
it
is
to
have
one
individual
rate
raised
or
to
have
one
individual
rate
that
he
thinks
is
a
little
bit
too
high
and
wouldn't
it
be
a
little
anomalous
to
say
that
he
can
have
court
review
where
his
interests
are
affected
to
a
minor
degree
and
can't
have
court
review,
if
his
interests
are
affected
to
a
major
degree.
now
that
brings
me
to
the
policy
question,
the
railroads
argue
that
this
court
should
deny
relief
because
some
district
court
might
improvidently
grant
interlocutory
relief
to
a
shipper,
to
the
railroads
detriment.
from
my
experience,
i
think
that
danger
is
greatly
exaggerated
but
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
the
district
court
might
act
improvidently.
but
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
safeguards
that
attach
to
interlocutory
relief
are
not
sufficient
in
a
general
increase
case,
then
the
thing
to
do
is
to
shore
up
those
safeguards.
it's
not
to
deny
judicial
review.
you
don't
throw
out
the
baby
with
the
bath
water.
in
a
second
place
when
congress
authorized
review
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
orders,
it
knew
then
interlocutory
relief
would
be
granted
in
cases
which
the
courts
think
are
appropriate.
if
the
safeguards
and
interlocutory
relief
are
not
sufficient,
the
railroads
ought
to
be
talking
to
the
congress
and
not
to
this
court.
and
while
we‘re
on
the
field
of
public
policy,
i
would
just
like
to
remind
the
court
that
there
are
two
sides
to
every
coin.
and
we
think
that
the
policy
reasons
for
judicial
review
vastly
out
weigh
any
on
the
other
side.
if
an
agency
is
insulated
from
judicial
review,
there
is
always
the
risk
that
there
are
handling
of
cases
of
this
kind
may
become
perfunctory.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
i
am
stating
exactly
that
your
honor.
there
is
no
revenue
of
review.
this
is
where
the
review
stops,
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
get
review
of
what
the
commission
did
in
this
general
increased
proceeding
unless
we
get
it
by
a
direct
review.
if
we
go
back
to
the
commission
challenging
--
we
would
have
to
challenge
every
rate
across
the
board
because
we're
interested
in
every
rate
and
we
say
to
the
commission,
we
are
raising
no
question
about
where
this
particular
rate
stands
in
relation
to
this
new
level
of
rates.
in
this
new
level
of
reasonableness
that
you've
established
and
we
want
to
re-litigate
everything
that
you
did
in
259.
the
commission
very
properly
is
going
to
say
“this
isn't
the
forum
to
do
it
and
that
is
you
would
settle
it”
and
wouldn't
it
be
a
monstrous
administrative
procedure
to
say
that
you
retail
this
old
ground
in
all
of
these
individual
cases
after
the
commission
has
spent
months
and
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
and
arguments
and
briefs
resolving
this
specific
question.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
if
the
court
please,
this
effort
to
equate
suspension
with
the
order
in
this
case
is
pretty
far
fetched.
suspension
is
something
an
order
not
to
suspend
is
an
order
which
the
commission
makes
without
any
record
on
a
basis
of
a
casual
observation
of
the
contentions
of
the
parties.
here,
we
have
an
order
made
after
extensive
hearings
and
on
the
basis
of
detailed
findings.
that's
the
distinction
between
a
suspension
order
and
this
type
of
order.
the
suspension
order
is
discretionary
and
that's
the
reason
it's
not
reviewable.
now
the
mere
fact
that
an
order
doesn't
finally
fix
the
lawfulness
of
rates
does
not
stop
it
from
being
reviewable.
in
both
interstate
--
well,
the
mcclain
case
and
the
waterways
case,
the
orders
there
involved
did
not
finally
fix
the
lawfulness
of
rates.
the
court
commented
that
the
rates
were
still
subject
to
reparation
but
there
was
no
question
about
them
being
reviewable.
finally,
i
don't
think
i
have
been
able
to
make
myself
clear
as
to
the
relationship
between
a
general
level
of
rates
and
a
particular
rate.
when
the
commission
fixes
this
general
level
and
i
go
back
in
with
a
complaint
against
a
particular
rate.
that
general
level
is
a
standard
against
which
my
rate
is
measured.
i
don't
get
a
chance
to
litigate
that
question
again.
and
if
i
am
raising
no
question
as
i
am
about
how
a
particular
rate
should
be
related
to
that
general
level,
i
have
nothing
to
go
back
to
the
commission
with.
it's
a
waste
of
my
time,
a
waste
of
the
commission's
time.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
no
your
honor,
because
we
have
here
an
order
modifying
outstanding
orders.
we
have
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
shippers.
the
railroads
concede
that
there
are
such
outstanding
orders.
it
concedes
that
fourth
section
relief
is
necessary.
mr.
charles
j.
mccarthy
well
it's
--
except
for
that
point
there.
i
think
we
can
win
either
on
the
basis
that
we
have
no
administrative
remedy
and
we
don't.
all
we
can
win
on
the
basis
that
there
is
an
order
setting,
modifying
outstanding
orders
and
granting
fourth
section
relief
which
cannot
be
done
without
a
hearing.
thank
you.
