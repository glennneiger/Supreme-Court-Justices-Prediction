justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
if
the
railroads
dismissed
this
whole
proceeding
and
just
filed
a
specific
rate
with
respect
to
the
commodities
your
clients
are
interested
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
then,
you
would
have
to
challenge
the
rate
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
issues
in
that
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
let's
assume
this
whole
proceeding
had
never
started
and
the
railroad
simply
come
forward
and
filed
a
new
specific
rates
on
specific
commodities
that
your
clients
are
interested
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
be
the
issues
in
that
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
doesn't
the
statute
tell
the
commission
some
factors
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
those
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
revenue
needs
of
the
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
you
get
any
broader
review
in
this
proceeding
than
you
would
in
a
152,
if
the
railroad
had
just
started
out
filing
specific
rates
rather
than
the
general
rate,
what's
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
issues,
if
they
had
filed
specific
tariffs
and
neither
one
of
the
alternative
things
would
have
happened.
what
would
have
been
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
unreasonable
for
the
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
your
files
clear
and
the
rates
are
there
exactly?

(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
i
take
it
(inaudible)
whether
the
issues
that
the
commission
does
determine
in
this
general
proceeding
are
foreclosed
from
free
examination
and
subsequent
specific
rate
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
if
shippers
fails
to
act
the
particular
determinations
of
this
general
revenue
proceeding
now
by
seeking
review.
even
if
they
were
entitled
they
wouldn't
be
foreclosed
from
raising
the
same
issues
in
a
specific
rate
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
probably
would
take
this
first
and
you
would
have
the
record
but
the
same
issues
could
be
reviewed
formerly.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
get
the
same
--
later
in
court
on
the

record
as
you
you
can
get
the
thing
that
you
are
claiming
--
justice
byron

how
was
the
matter
to
this
specific
that's
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
other
issues?
justice
byron

white
and
the
court
will
look
at
them
all
at

justice
byron

white
the
cost
of
the
general
determination.
justice
byron

white
how
long
is
it
after
commission
makes
the
determinations
like
this
well,
immediately
at
that
specific
rates
taken
in
to
account
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
point
the
shipper
gets
a
specific
rate
would
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
these
shippers
could
win
this
case
here,
it
these
rates
set
aside
and
then
turn
right
around
and
then
lose
a
case
in
which
the
railroads
filed
specific
rates
on
their
commodity.
justice
byron

white
well
mr.
cox
isn't
it
--
doesn't
it
really
sound
as
though
the
just
and
reasonableness
language
is
just
inappropriate
for
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
this
--
they're
really
saying
that
probable
cause
to
increase
these
rates.
there's
enough
evidence
not
to
suspend.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
as
though
the
commission
hasn't
said
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
specific
rate
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
doesn't
bar
anything
in
a
subsequent
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
critical
to
your
argument?
justice
byron

white
will
you
lose
the
case
if
you
are
wrong?
justice
byron

is
it
critical?
