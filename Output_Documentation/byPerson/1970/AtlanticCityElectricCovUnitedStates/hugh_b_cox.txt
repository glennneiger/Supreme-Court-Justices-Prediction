mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
this
case
to
railroads.
i
think
i
should
like
to
begin
by
commenting
briefly
on
some
aspects
of
the
statutory
plan
that
were
touched
upon
this
morning
but
which
i
think
perhaps
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court
to
remember
while
i
give
my
version
of
what
happened
in
this
case
and
what
the
case
is
really
about.
the
point
that
i
should
like
to
particularly
make
is
that
when
a
carrier
initiates
a
rate.
the
only
authority
that
the
commission
has
to
interfere
with
a
tiny
of
that
rate
increase
prior
to
a
final
determination
that
a
particular
rates
involved
are
unlawful
is
power
to
suspend
the
rates
for
seven
months.
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
rates
become
effective
by
operation
of
law
not
by
virtue
of
any
order
that
the
commission.
that's
what
section
157
provides
and
they
remain
effective
until
the
commission
has
made
a
final
determination
that
the
particular
rates
involved
in
a
rate
change
are
unlawful.
this
is
the
basic
statutory
plan
that
was
involved
and
discussed
in
the
earl
case
and
as
the
opinion
there
pointed
out.
it
was
an
accommodation
between
the
interest
of
those
who
sought
that
the
railroad
should
not
be
able
to
change
any
rate
without
prior
approval
of
the
commission
and
the
position
of
the
railroads
who
wanted
to
be
able
to
change
the
rates
without
any
interference
by
the
commission
subsequent
only
to
a
subsequent
determination
of
their
lawfulness.
and
under
this
accommodation,
the
railroads
bear
irreparably
the
losses
occasioned
by
the
seven
month
suspension
period.
if
the
rates
thereafter
held
be
lawful,
the
railroads
have
no
way
of
recovering
that
money.
on
the
other
hand,
the
shippers
--
if
the
rates
go
into
effect
at
the
end
of
the
seven
months
period
are
protected
by
their
right
to
recover
reparations
or
by
the
normal
refund
provisions
of
the
commissions
attached
under
157.
now
with
that
preface,
i
should
like
to
state
what
i
think
happened
in
this
case
and
what
the
real
pragmatic
consequences
to
take
mr.
springer's
words
over
this
commission
orders
were.
as
it's
been
said
the
case
started
with
a
petition
asking
for
leave
to
file
a
single
master
tariff
which
the
commission
granted.
now,
no
review
has
been
sought
of
that
order
and
after
they
got
the
permission,
the
railroads
filed
a
tariff
which
i
think
was
to
become
effective
on
the
24th
of
june
1968.
it
had
to
make
it
that
far
ahead
because
the
commission
has
a
condition
of
getting
the
permission
requiring
it
to
do
so.
the
first
thing
that
the
commission
did
was
to
suspend
that
first
master
tariff
for
the
entire
seven
months
period
and
at
the
same
time
however,
it
said
to
the
railroads
“now
if
you
want
to
file
another
tariff
that
makes
only
a
3%
increase.”
the
increases
in
the
master
tariffs
have
been
three
to
six,
said
to
the
railroads
“if
you
wish
to
file
another
tariff,
it
makes
only
a
3%
increase,
we
will
not
suspend
that
tariff.”
and
the
railroads
did
so
and
that
3%
tariff
went
into
effect,
and
the
time
the
commission
did
this,
it
said
to
the
railroads
in
effect
in
its
order
“now
we
are
investigating
this
matter
and
we
may
decide
later
on
that
we
should
have
suspended
these
rates
even
as
to
the
3%
and
if
we
decide
that
we
should
have
done
that
as
to
any
or
all
of
these
rates,
then
you
are
going
to
have
to
restore
the
situation
to
what
it
would
have
been
if
we
had
suspended
the
rates
by
making
refunds.”
the
next
thing
that
the
commission
did
was
to
issue
an
issue
an
order
in
november
which
has
been
called
its
interim
order
and
in
that
order
it
decided
in
effect
that
it
should
not
have
suspended
the
any
part
of
the
rate
increase
and
that
it
would
permit
the
entire
rate
increase
to
go
in
to
effect
at
the
end
of
november.
at
the
same
time
again
saying
to
these
carriers
and
a
way
it
did
that
again
was
to
say
“you
can
file
another
tariff”
which
the
railroads
did
which
put
the
additional
3%
into
effect.
at
the
same
time,
it
said
to
the
railroads
“we're
still
looking
at
this
and
when
we
come
to
our
final
conclusion,
if
we
decide
that
we
should
have
suspended
some
or
all
of
these
rates
for
the
entire
statutory
period,
you
are
going
to
have
to
restore
the
situation
to
what
it
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
such
a
suspension.”
and
in
the
end
there
in
january
it
issued
a
final
order
in
which
it
said
some
of
these
rates,
few
of
them,
i
think
there
are
about
nine
instances
should
have
been
suspended
otherwise
we
think
that
our
orders
can
stand.
so
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
issue
in
this
case,
my
view
of
what's
happened
is
simply
whether
an
order
of
the
commission
which
refuses
to
suspend
a
proposed
rate
increase
for
the
entire
seven
months
period
but
does
not
determine
the
lawfulness
of
all
or
any
of
the
rates
involved
but
leaves
that
to
be
determined
in
subsequent
proceedings
is
reviewable.
because
we
believe
that
was
the
only
consequence
of
what
this
commission
did
here.
to
put
the
matter
in
other
way,
we
say
that
what
the
actual
pragmatic
effect
of
these
orders
does
not
differ
significantly
from
an
order
that
a
commission
enters
in
any
ordinary
suspension
case
in
which
it
refuses
to
suspend
rates
for
all
or
any
part
or
some
part
of
the
seven
months
suspension
period.
now,
we
believe
that
an
order
of
that
kind
which
we
think
this
order
is,
should
not
be
reviewable
and
our
reasons
rest
both
upon
analysis
of
statute
and
upon
certain
practical
considerations.
the
commission
has
been
issuing
these
general
revenue
orders
for
more
than
50
years
and
in
the
line
of
cases
that
we
have
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief
from
pages
24
to
25.
the
courts
have
held
that
these
orders
are
not
reviewable
and
that
the
shipper
has
an
adequate
remedy
by
way
of
complaint
and
reparation.
the
courts
have
also
held
relates
to
what
i
said
a
moment
ago
about
the
effect
of
this
order
and
its
relationship
to
a
suspension
proceedings
and
they
have
held
i
think
uniformly
that
an
order
of
the
commission
that
refuses
to
suspend
rates
is
not
reviewable.
now,
both
of
these
lines
of
cases,
those
cases
by
the
way
are
collected
in
the
opinion
in
long
island
case
in
193
federal
sub
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
at
least
the
cases
up
to
1961.
since
that
time
there
have
been
a
number
of
other
cases
refusing
to
review,
orders
that
refuse
to
suspend.
now
both
of
these
groups
of
cases,
those
that
are
refused
to
review
the
general
revenue
orders
and
those
that
have
refused
to
review
the
orders
declining
to
suspend,
to
examine
the
opinions.
it
seems
to
me
to
rest
on
two
related
considerations,
one
rests
on
the
structure
of
the
act
and
particularly
on
section
157
because
it
seems
clear
and
this
was
the
purpose
of
my
preliminary
statement
that
under
that
section,
the
question
whether
the
commission
should
interfere
with
the
timing
of
a
proposed
rate
increase
by
suspending
the
rates
is
not
a
matter
that
is
appropriate
for
judicial
review
because
it
is
committed
to
the
commission's
discretion.
the
commission
when
it
refuses
to
suspend
a
rate
is
not
required
to
make
any
findings,
not
required
by
the
statute
to
have
any
hearing,
it's
not
required
to
give
anybody
any
reasons
for
its
action.
the
statute
permits
it
to
do
that
and
along
ago
in
the
board
against
the
great
northern
case
which
i
think
is
281
u.s.
the
court
--
this
court
said
that
the
power
suspension
is
entrusted
to
congress
or
to
the
commission
only.
now,
we
submit
when
you
look
at
this,
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
practical
considerations
in
a
moment
but
when
you
look
at
this
body
of
authority
and
consider
it
has
existed
with
the
length
of
time
that
it
has,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
it
in
the
case
of
these
general
revenue
determinations.
they
do
not
and
i
will
discuss
this
point
in
a
moment
also,
they
do
not
determine
the
lawfulness
at
any
or
all
of
these
rates
but
railroads
may
increase
as
a
result
of
the
order
and
as
i
think
they
do
not
preclude
the
shipper
from
litigating
any
issue
that
is
relevant
in
any
section
13
proceeding.
these
orders,
and
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
this.
now,
i
think
it
is
clear,
do
not
determine
the
lawfulness
of
any
of
the
rates
and
i'm
not
sure
that
appellants
dispute
that
fact
but
there
isn't
any
room
to
dispute
it
because
the
commission
says
right
in
its
report
that
it
is
not
determining
that
any
of
these
rates
are
reasonable
rates
that
everyone
of
them
is
subject
to
correction
and
that
they
are
in
all
respects
and
i
emphasize
in
all
respects
and
this
is
the
commission's
language.
they
all
are
in
all
respects
subject
to
complaint
and
investigation
and
again
long
ago,
this
court
in
the
brimstone
case
and
talking
about
orders
of
the
very
kind
that
are
here
involved
said
“those
orders
do
not
approve
or
fix
any
rate,
they
do
not
determine
that
any
rate
is
reasonable.
they
do
not
approve
in
advance
any
rate
that
may
be
filed
as
a
result
of
the
orders.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
one
is
the
idea
that
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
other
idea
is
that
the
shipper
has
inadequate
remedy
under
the
complaint
proceeding
to
which
he
should
resort
before
seeking
judicial
review.
you'll
find
those
two
notions
implicit
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
i
have
difficulty
i
must
confess
to
the
court
with
a
concept
of
finality.
it's
always
a
question
of
what
order
is
final
about.
now
i
would
--
i'd
be
prepared
to
concede
that
this
order
is
final
so
far
as
it
refuses
to
suspend
rates
but
it
isn't
final
as
to
lawfulness
of
any
rate.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
prematurity.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
but
it's
a
combination
of
those
things
that
you
will
find
in
these
opinions
and
you
find
them
both
in
their
reach
in
the
opinions
that
relate
to
simple
refusals
to
suspend
and
any
opinions
that
have
to
do
with
the
general
revenue
orders.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh
yes.
that
seemed
to
be
(inaudible)
when
i
answer
this
question
because
i
have
recently
read
all
of
them.
the
first
general
revenue
proceeding
was
really
i
think
in
1910
or
1911
just
after
the
mann-
elkins
act
was
passed
but
i
would
say
that
this
form
of
proceeding
that
we
have
before
us
today,
really
began
after
the
transportation
act
of
1920
and
with
the
general
rate
increase
of
1920.
the
decisions
was
that
the
general
rate
proceedings
before
the
kaiser
war
are
i
think
in
somewhat
a
different
category
but
after
1920
this
thing
developed
until
it
--
and
by
early
in
the
30's
it
reached
about
kind
of
form
and
substance
it
now
has.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
this
is
an
administrative
mechanism
which
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes
sir.
you
might
save
to
paraphrase
sir
henry
that
it's
been
secreted
in
the
interspecies
of
the
procedure
that
is
provided
by
section
157
but
it's
quite
different
kind
of
development
that
rests
on
that
but
is
in
certain
respect
different.
i
may
say
since
you
have
raised
this
question
that
the
commission
itself
has
in
its
orders,
didn't
in
these
orders
but
in
the
other
general
revenue
orders,
it
is
recognized
the
--
what
i've
said
about
the
similarity
between
this
and
the
suspension
case
in
the
1920
general
rate
increase.
commissioner
eastman
in
his
concurring
opinion
said
“essentially
what
we
have
here
is
a
proceeding
like
a
suspension
proceeding.
there's
no
finality
about
it,
we're
just
deciding
whether
we
should
allow
these
rates
to
go
into
effect.
and
in
two
later
decisions,
i
get
--
i
cannot
be
certain
about
these
but
i
think
it
was
a
general
rate
increase
of
1958
and
the
general
rate
increase
in
1960,
the
commission
made
somewhat
comparable
statements
comparing
this
to
what
goes
on
in
ordinary
suspension
case.
i
think
in
one
of
those
opinions
they
quoted
a
mr.
eastmans's
statement
in
the
1920
case.
now,
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
position,
they
do
not
deny
that
they
have
another
remedy.
they
argued
that
the
remedy
is
not
adequate
and
so
far
as
i
could
understand,
i
think
that
argument
rests
essentially
on
the
contention
that
because
of
the
commission's
determinations
in
a
general
revenue
proceeding.
they
will
be
precluded
either
by
something
like
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
as
a
practical
matter
from
re-litigating
these
issues
or
relevant
issues
in
a
complaint
proceeding.
now,
we
submit
that
they
are
simply
wrong
about
that
and
that
there
is
no
warrant
in
authority
or
logic
or
in
the
commission
precedent
or
practice
for
the
view
they
take.
i
think,
i
should
say
this
in
candor
about
these
general
revenue
determinations
that
are
made
in
a
general
revenue
order.
they
relate
of
course
to
all
rates
and
to
all
carriers
as
a
group
and
they're
made
on
the
basis
of
typical
evidence
but
in
a
very
general
way.
now
the
determinations
that
the
commission
makes
on
that
kind
of
evidence
and
that
kind
of
proceeding
may
have
only
a
limited
relevance
in
a
proceeding
relating
to
particular
rates
but
although
in
commission
in
those
proceedings
does
often
give
consideration
to
revenue
needs
of
the
carriers.
sometimes
in
general
terms,
sometimes
simply
in
terms
of
the
revenue
needs
as
related
to
the
particular
traffic
involved.
but
of
course
that
–
these
revenue
needs
in
a
particular
rate
proceeding
have
only
one
several
factor.
the
commission
has
often
told
the
railroads
that
they
can't
justify
a
rate
--
particular
rate
just
because
they
need
money.
they
have
to
justify
it
--
it's
reasonableness
on
other
grounds
and
the
commission
looks
at
comparisons
with
comparable
rates,
with
a
nature
of
commodity,
with
a
cost
involved,
to
what
degree
there
is
competition.
whereby
other
modes
of
transportation,
the
suggestion
that
these
particular
rate
cases
that
commission
doesn't
examine
the
problem
of
diversions,
this
i
think
as
mistaken
and
look
at
all
they
seem.
now
to
the
extent
that
any
issue
that
is
determined
on
revenue
needs
or
anything
else
is
relevant
in
a
particular
rate
proceeding,
complaint
proceeding.
we
submit
that
the
commission
will
look
at
it,
the
shipper
is
not
precluded
from
raising
it
and
litigating
it
and
getting
entitled
to
have
judicial
review
of
any
determination
the
commission
makes
about
it.
now
they
have
cited
this,
there
had
been
some
discussions
of
koppers
case,
303
icc,
i
think
mr.
springer
is
quite
candid
in
indicating
and
i
joined
with
him
that
no
one
quite
knows
what
that
murky
passage
in
the
opinion
means.
i
think
i
know
what
it
means
but
i
can't
be
sure
about.
i
think
all
it
meant
was
that
the
commission
wasn't
going
to
litigate
in
that
case
whether
it
made
a
mistake
in
refusing
to
suspend
the
rates.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
koppers
case,
yes,
i
think
that's
what
it
means.
there
are
other
cases
and
we
have
cited
them
in
our
brief,
one
is
the
gold
soap
case
where
the
railroads
try
to
justify
a
rate
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
issued
pursuant
to
a
general
revenue
order.
and
the
commission
said
“no,
you
can't
do
that,
that's
no
justification
whatsoever
to
this
rate.
we
didn't
approve
this
rate,
we
didn't
fix
this
rate,
you
have
got
to
justify
it”
and
i
think
what
is
more
significant
is
that
the
commission
has
awarded
reparation.
bound
rates
were
unjust
to
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
awarded
reparation
with
respect
to
rates
that
were
established
pursuant
to
these
general
revenue
orders
and
when
the
carry
railroad
who
tried
to
argue
that
those
orders
of
justification
for
the
rates
that
commission
has
said
“no,”
they
are
not
a
justification
and
at
least
in
one
instance
the
court
said
that
that
was
quite
correct.
that's
the
cotton
valley
oil
company
case,
i
think
which
is
against
the
southern
railway
which
i
think
is
in
51
federal
supplement.
so
as
a
practical
matter
and
i
accept
the
pragmatic
test
has
a
practical
matter
in
these
complaint
proceedings,
even
though
the
rate
is
at
the
level
fixed
by
or
level
that
the
railroads
is
fixed
pursuant
to
some
general
revenue
order.
the
commission
has
looked
at
the
rates,
held
they
were
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
given
the
shippers
reparation.
now
i
must
confess
that
i
am
not
altogether
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
altogether
understand
the
argument
that
the
appellant
made
on
this
point
of
the
adequacy
of
remedy.
they
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
did
say
in
its
report
when
it
decided
that
not
to
suspend
these
rates
for
a
full
period
that
it
found
that
the
general
level
of
the
rates
was
be
just
and
reasonable.
filed
an
statement
which
it
immediately
qualified
by
saying
we're
only
talking
about
the
general
basis
of
the
rates.
we're
not
holding
that
any
of
the
rates
are
lawful
and
they
are
all
subject
to
investigation
and
complaint
in
all
respects.
but
then
the
appellants
say
that
in
a
complaint
proceeding
they
can't
attack
the
general
level
of
these
rates.
and
at
that
point,
either
because
of
some
weakness
of
the
flesh
or
infirmity
of
the
mind,
i
cannot
follow
because
i
had
assumed
perhaps
in
blindness
that
what
a
shipper
pays
is
the
rate
that
is
applicable
to
his
shipments
and
his
commodities.
he
doesn't
pay
any
general
rate
level
and
that
under
the
statute,
if
he
has
a
remedy
that
will
give
him
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
which
he
has
in
this
case
that
that
satisfies
the
statute
and
if
he
gets
judicial
review
in
that
proceeding
that
that
is
an
adequate
remedy.
now
i
think
if
you
look
and
you
could
only
do
what
i
think
by
random
sampling,
you
will
see
that
when
the
commission
determines
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
particular
rates.
this
abstraction
of
the
general
rate
level
does
not
have
any
weight
in
these
deliberations.
it
considers
and
deals
with
those
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
including
the
revenue
needs
that
the
evidence
before
it
and
it
relates
to
those
rates
and
to
the
extent
as
far
as
i
can
tell
reading
from
reading
the
reports
of
the
commission
that
it
relies
on
president,
it
relies
only
on
cases
in
which
it
has
actually
prescribed
or
determined
that
a
rate
that
is
lawful.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
same
rates
or
possibly
higher
rates.
now
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
in
discussing
reviewability,
i
was
going
to
come
to
the
practical
considerations
that
we
think
supports
our
analytical
argument
based
on
the
statute.
first
to
those
practical
considerations
has
to
do
with
this
matter
of
injunctive
relief.
now,
i
have
to
say
that
in
discussing
these
problems,
i
find
them
very
puzzling
and
that
i
feared
going
to
be
more
adept
of
raising
them
and
i
am
answering
them.
the
trouble
is
that
because
these
general
revenue
orders
are
never
been
reviewed
and
the
orders
refusing
to
suspend
rates
have
never
been
reviewed.
there
simply
is
many
precedent
where
this
is
a
very
uncharted
line
of
country.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
is
inappropriate
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right
or
you
could
say
this,
say
we
had
a
look
at
them
and
doesn't
appear
to
us
as
any
reason
why
we
should
suspend
them
for
the
full
statutory
period.
we
will
allow
them
to
go
in
effect
and
they'll
determine
whether
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
odd
thing
is
mr.
justice
white
that
in
an
ordinary
suspension
case
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
do
say
that.
they
use
this
same
kind
of
justness
and
reasonableness
language.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
a
specific
rate
cases
although
if
there's
anything
it's
well
settled.
it
is
that
when
they
suspend
or
refuse
to
misspend
a
rate
they
are
not
making
any
determination
about
its
lawfulness.
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
a
case
where
they
used
that
kind
of
language
in
a
specific
rate
case,
i
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
no.
this
bureaucratic
language
tends
to
repeat
itself
when
they
ship
from
place
to
place
some
times
without
too
much
consideration
whether
it's
appropriate
but
they
use
this
just
and
reasonable
language
even
in
an
ordinary.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
can
do
that,
they
don't
have
to
say
anything
and
they
can
do
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
one
of
the
success,
the
rate
increases
that
followed
this
one.
the
one
in
1969,
they
just
--
they
let
that
go
into
effect
at
once.
they
refused
to
investigate
anything
except
questions
of
discrimination
and
preference.
they
wouldn't
investigate
reasonableness
and
they
did
this
in
an
order
that's
a
page
and
a
half,
they
didn't
go
through
this
elaborate
discussion
to
make
these
findings
and
all
these
reasons
and
under
the
statute
they
can
do
that.
they
have
developed
a
practice
over
the
years
of
writing
these
elaborate
dissertations
in
these
general
revenue
cases
and
this
and
why
they
used
the
language
in
the
suspension
cases,
i
could
not
attempt
to
explain
but
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
problem
of
injunctive
relief.
i
think
the
appellants
have
not
quite
met
the
real
problem
there
which
is
a
problem
i
think
that
suggests
that
the
kind
of
relief
that
they
really
want
on
judicial
review
can't
be
obtained
without
doing
violence
to
the
statutory
plan.
now
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this,
these
general
rate
proceedings
frequently
consume
a
large
part
of
the
statutory
seven
months
suspension
period
and
people
can't
go
into
court
until
the
commission
is
finished.
now
when
somebody
goes
into
court
and
wants
interlocutory
relief
and
it's
natural
for
him
to
do
so
because
that's
one
of
the
purpose
of
judicial
review.
the
court
is
going
to
be
faced
with
a
problem
of
whether
it
can
enjoin
the
rate
increase
beyond
the
seven
months
period.
because
in
some
cases
by
the
time
they
get
to
court,
the
seven
months
period
will
expire
or
nearly
expire
and
the
same
question
will
arise
as
to
and
it
was
raised
this
morning
i
think
or
after
lunch
as
to
what
the
court
does
after
a
final
hearing.
if
it
finds
that
there
was
some
infirmity
in
the
commissions
order,
does
it
enjoin
the
rates
for
more
than
seven
months
period?
now,
the
position
of
the
railroads
is
that
neither
the
commission
nor
a
court
even
as
an
incident
to
judicial
review
can
enjoin
or
suspend
rates
if
not
been
adjudicated
to
be
unlawful
as
such
beyond
the
seven
months
period.
but
the
law
on
that
point
is
not
yet
clear
and
what
the
railroads
with
a
reason
apprehend
is
that
first
it
can't
be
certain
how
the
question
must
be
settled
and
second
until
the
question
is
settled
and
settled
applies
--
as
soon
a
way
that
applies
to
all
the
possible
situations
that
these
general
rate
increases
are
going
to
be
indefinitely
delayed
in
many
cases
beyond
the
seven
months
period
by
interlocutory
and
final
injunction.
as
has
been
observed
these
suits
can
be
brought
in
any
district
in
the
country,
they
could
involve
different
commodities,
different
shippers,
different
argument
could
be
made
about
the
general
rate
increase.
the
government
recognizes
this
problem
and
it's
attempted
to
make
some
palatine
suggestions
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
those
suggestions.
consider
all
of
them
you
can
see
that
it
is
not,
they
are
not
likely
to
really
solve
this
problem.
and
of
course
if
the
problem
as
i
cannot
get
relief
beyond
the
seven
months
period
which
is
our
position,
then
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
judicial
review
i
suppose
is
gone
at
this
point.
the
judicial
review
of
these
orders
also
creates
a
difficult
problem
about
the
refund
provisions
of
the
commission's
general
revenue
orders.
now
we
have
discussed
that
matter
in
our
brief
and
i
should
like
to
refer
the
court
to
that
discussion.
i
simply
like
to
say
this
about
it
that
that
is
a
difficulty
that
arises
because
these
refund
provisions
and
these
general
revenue
orders
are
little
peculiar.
unlike
the
normal
refund
provision
in
an
ordinary
section
157
case.
they
do
not
come
in
to
operation
or
the
operation
does
not
depend
i
should
say
upon
a
final
determination
that
that
the
particular
rates
are
unlawful.
their
operation
simply
depends
upon
the
determination
by
the
commission
that
it
made
a
mistake
in
allowing
the
rates
to
become
effective
or
not
to
suspend
the
rates.
so
that
under
these
provisions
the
railroads
could
and
do
at
times
have
to
refund
money
that
they
have
collected
from
rates
that
are
never
been
determined
to
be
unlawful
and
which
they
have
to
be
determined
to
be
unlawful
simply
because
the
commission
has
determined
that
the
rate
should
have
been
suspended.
now
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
these
refunds
i
am
speaking
of
are
refunds
that
the
commission
attaches
as
condition
to
its
refusal
to
suspend
the
rates.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
when
the
railroads
take
advantage
of
that
refusal
of
course,
they
have
to
accept
the
conditions.
they
are
bound
by
them.
now
if
these
refunds
is
here
to
for,
there's
been
uncertainty
about
these
refunds
but
the
railroads
have
at
least
been
certain
that
the
time
within
which
the
liability
would
accumulate
would
be
limited
at
the
time
that
the
commission
was
required
to
consider
the
matter.
and
while
there
was
uncertainty
it
was
an
uncertainty
that
arose
from
the
uncertainties
about
what
one
agency
would
do.
now
there
has
to
be
judicial
review
of
these
orders,
of
course
the
times
in
which
this
uncertainty
will
continue
and
that
length
of
time
in
which
these
contingent
liabilities
will
accumulate
will
be
extended
and
the
uncertainties
will
be
increased
by
the
facts
that
there
you
have
two
agencies
and
instead
of
one
and
his
views
on
these
matter
may
differ.
now
that
means
that
when
the
railroads
get
a
general
rate
increase
if
there
is
to
be
judicial
review,
they
are
going
to
have
a
very
great
problem
about
whether
they
can
use
this
money
or
how
much
of
it
they
can
use
or
whether
they
have
to
setup
a
contingent
reserve
to
take
care
of
this
contingent
liability.
they
can't
very
well
plan
or
make
definitive
plan
that
may
hamper
the
ability
to
use
the
money
for
permanent
purposes.
in
the
present
cash
position
of
many
of
the
railroads
this
is
rather
a
serious
problem.
i
have
so
far
in
this
argument
talked
about
the
commission's
order
simply
in
terms
of
what
its
consequences
are
on
the
general
level
of
rates
or
on
rates
generally.
i
would
now
like
to
say
something
about
the
--
i
think
a
minor
point
really
about
the
provisions
of
the
orders
that
grant
relief
under
the
fourth
section
and
from
outstanding
order.
those
provisions
of
the
order
affect
only
a
very
small
number
of
the
rates
and
they
do
not
have
much
economic
significance.
i
am
told
that
the
rate
experts
in
the
rate
conferences
say
that
even
without
that
relief,
they
could
generally
achieve
the
economic
results
of
a
--
one
of
the
general
revenue
orders
by
excluding
those
rates
and
making
them
the
subject
of
separate
proceedings.
but
for
purposes
of
this
afternoon
i'm
going
to
assume
that
orders
that
grant
fourth
section
relief
and
it
relieve
from
outstanding
orders
are
in
an
appropriate
case
reviewable
but
my
submission
is
that
this
in
this
case,
it
is
not,
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
to
review
the
provisions
of
those
provisions
of
the
orders
that
are
here
before
the
court.
the
appellants
here
haven't
not
alleged
in
any
of
the
named
appellants
are
affected
in
any
degree
by
those
provisions.
they
have
not
argued
that
they
are
affected
and
when
you
look
at
their
arguments,
they
aren't
directed
to
fourth
section
problems
or
to
any
problems
that
arise
under
outstanding
rate
orders.
they're
directed
to
the
general
revenue
determinations
of
the
commission
in
a
way
that
it
made
them.
now
in
a
precisely
similar
situation,
one
of
the
algoma
case
in
11
federal
supplement
where
the
same
kind
of
an
argument
that
was
made,
the
court
said
“well
these
shippers
haven't
shown
they're
affected,
these
provisions
are
simply
incidental
to
the
main
purpose
of
the
order
and
we
won't
refuse
them
and
we
submit
that
that
should
be
the
conclusion
here.”
i
am
not
going
to
say
anything
about
the
assertion
that
some
of
these
appellants
represent
all
shippers,
all
commodities
in
the
united
states
except
to
say
that
in
this,
there
is
some
--
this
vague
indication
that
who
these
members
of
this
enormous
class
maybe
and
that
are
affected
by
the
fourth
section
orders.
i
shouldn't
think
that
justify
judicial
review.
and
finally
if
the
court
should
think
that
it
has
to
look
at
that
part
of
these
orders
and
i
suggest
that
the
review
should
extend
only
to
those
rates
that
are
covered
by
the
fourth
section
provisions
and
the
relief
from
outstanding
orders
and
not
extend
to
the
generality
of
rates
or
the
general
revenue
determination
that
are
here
involved.
i
think
that
i
should
like
to
conclude
by
saying
something
about
the
merits
of
this
case,
we
have
asked
this
court
if
it
--
and
the
unhappy
event
that
it
should
determine
that
these
orders
are
reviewable
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
orders
and
affirm
them.
now,
we
knew
and
we
made
that
request
that
this
court
has
often
said
that
will
not
or
is
it
reluctant
to
consider
agency
orders,
findings
that
have
not
been
reviewed
by
lower
court.
but
that
i
assume
is
not
a
iron-clad
rule
and
this
court
has
sometimes
departed
from
it.
and
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
there
are
very
urgent
and
powerful
considerations
in
the
present
situation
that
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
determine
the
validity
of
this
order.
for
one
thing
this
contingent
liability
under
the
refund
provisions
is
accumulating.
it
accumulates
possibly
at
the
rate
of
400
million
dollars
a
year
and
if
the
railroads
are
going
to
have
to
give
some
or
all
of
that
back,
it
seems
to
me
the
sooner
they
know
about
it
better.
but
apart
from
that
as
it
has
been
stated.
there
have
been
three
rate
increases
since
this
rate
increase
that
is
here
involved
and
in
the
showing
that
the
railroads
made
to
the
commission
on
those
rate
increases.
they
of
course
assume
the
availability
of
this
rate
increase
and
the
income
it
produces
and
presumably
in
granting
relief
of
the
commission
itself
assumed
the
same
thing.
now,
again
if
this
rate
increase
has
to
be
invalidated
in
some
way
or
the
railroads
are
going
to
have
to
give
back
any
or
all
of
the
large
amounts
of
money
involved,
the
sooner
the
railroads
and
i
should
suppose
the
commission
know
that
the
better
so
that
they
can
decide
whether
they
have
to
take
any
steps
in
view
of
that
situation
with
respect
to
the
revenue
situation
of
the
railroad.
now,
as
far
as
the
merits
are
concerned,
we
argue
them
in
our
briefs
and
in
its
reply
the
appellants
in
alabama
power
made
an
argument
on
the
merits.
the
appellants
in
the
atlantic
city
case
have
refused
to
argue
in
their
briefs
in
this
court
although
we
tendered
the
issue
to
them.
but
they
insisted
that
there
be
included
in
the
appendix,
a
memorandum
that
they
submitted
to
the
district
court
below
and
that
memorandum
contains
their
arguments
on
the
merits
so
they
are
before
the
court.
now
we
have
discussed
this
matter
of
the
merits
to
the
commission's
order
in
detail
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
merely
like
to
say
this.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
appellants
arguments
and
consider
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
was
here
involved
which
was
a
proceeding
as
i
have
said
really
is
essentially
devoted
to
the
question
whether
these
rates
should
be
suspended
for
the
whole
seven
months
period.
that
those
arguments
do
not
provide
any
basis
for
over
turning
the
commissions'
judgment,
apart
from
certain
procedural
arguments
which
really
relate
to
how
the
commission
manages
its
internal
business,
they
are
simply
arguments
that
attack
the
commission's
judgment
on
the
evidence
on
the
weight
it
gave
to
conflicting
evidence
on
the
inferences
and
conclusions
it
drew
from
the
evidence
and
on
the
wisdom
of
its
final
determination
not
to
spend
these
rates
for
the
entire
seven
months
period.
i
think
the
arguments
that
are
set
forth
in
the
reply
of
the
alabama
power
appellants
indicate
that
they
say
the
commission
shouldn't
have
authorized
it
nationwide,
that
it
shouldn't
have
used
1966
as
a
test
year
for
the
increase
in
the
expenses
and
other
arguments
that
kind
of
matters
about
which
reasonable
men
may
differ
but
there
are
also
matters
as
to
which
the
commission
has
an
area
of
judgment
and
which
its
judgment
i
suppose
will
be
respected
unless
it's
shown
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
i
think
when
you
read
the
commission's
report
in
this
case.
the
interim
report,
the
final
report,
the
parent
commission
considered
all
the
evidence,
gave
a
reasoned
statement
for
its
conclusions
and
i
think
it
is
not
impermissible
for
me
to
say
at
this
point
finally,
that
anyone
who
reads
the
facts
that
are
set
forth
in
the
commission's
reports
in
three
succeeding
general
increase
cases.
that
have
come
along
since
these
orders
are
involved.
anyone
who
looks
to
those
reports
and
reads
the
facts
they
will
contain,
they
contain
i
think
would
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that
when
the
commission
decided
in
1968
that
the
railroads
were
in
immediate
and
drastic
need
of
increased
freight
revenue.
that
experience
has
shown
that
the
commission
was
not
acting
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
when
on
the
basis
of
that
conclusion.
it
declined
to
differ
or
suspend
this
rate
increase.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there
have
been
i
think
around
15
mr.
justice
harlan
of
course
some
of
those
orders
have
involved
more
than
one
report
and
are
reported
in
more
than
one
place
because
some
of
them
went
on
for
a
time.
i
once
had
them
all
on
a
book
rack
and
it
was
a
depressing
sight
there
that
many
of
them
but
i
think
there
have
been
12
or
15
of
them.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
the
cases
since
1920
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
present
recollection
is
maybe
a
little
blurred
that
i
think
they
have
usually
involved
all
the
railroads.
now
before
1920,
my
recollection
is
that
there
were
some
cases
which
involved
only
the
eastern
railroads,
and
some
cases
which
involved
only
the
western
railroads
but
i
feel
thoroughly
confident
that
in
the
last
20
years,
they
have
involved
all
the
railroads.
now
sometimes
the
railroads
ask
for
different
amounts
increases
and
they
may
have
filed
different
applications
but
when
the
commission
gets
to
consider
them
and
usually
treats
as
one
big
decision.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
i
will
tell
you
what
i
meant
was
precisely
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
somewhat
clear
recollection
of
the
cases
since
about
1950
than
i
have
with
the
cases
before
that
and
i
--
there
may
have
been
some
cases
that
before
that
where
perhaps
not
all
the
railroads
were
involved.
but
i
think
since
1920
and
most
of
them
i
remember
they
were
all
the
railroads
in
the
united
states.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
thought
i
prepared
thoroughly
but
i
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it's
not
one
of
large.
thank
you.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
this
case
to
railroads.
i
think
i
should
like
to
begin
by
commenting
briefly
on
some
aspects
of
the
statutory
plan
that
were
touched
upon
this
morning
but
which
i
think
perhaps
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court
to
remember
while
i
give
my
version
of
what
happened
in
this
case
and
what
the
case
is
really
about.
the
point
that
i
should
like
to
particularly
make
is
that
when
a
carrier
initiates
a
rate.
the
only
authority
that
the
commission
has
to
interfere
with
a
tiny
of
that
rate
increase
prior
to
a
final
determination
that
a
particular
rates
involved
are
unlawful
is
power
to
suspend
the
rates
for
seven
months.
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
rates
become
effective
by
operation
of
law
not
by
virtue
of
any
order
that
the
commission.
that's
what
section
157
provides
and
they
remain
effective
until
the
commission
has
made
a
final
determination
that
the
particular
rates
involved
in
a
rate
change
are
unlawful.
this
is
the
basic
statutory
plan
that
was
involved
and
discussed
in
the
earl
case
and
as
the
opinion
there
pointed
out.
it
was
an
accommodation
between
the
interest
of
those
who
sought
that
the
railroad
should
not
be
able
to
change
any
rate
without
prior
approval
of
the
commission
and
the
position
of
the
railroads
who
wanted
to
be
able
to
change
the
rates
without
any
interference
by
the
commission
subsequent
only
to
a
subsequent
determination
of
their
lawfulness.
and
under
this
accommodation,
the
railroads
bear
irreparably
the
losses
occasioned
by
the
seven
month
suspension
period.
if
the
rates
thereafter
held
be
lawful,
the
railroads
have
no
way
of
recovering
that
money.
on
the
other
hand,
the
shippers
--
if
the
rates
go
into
effect
at
the
end
of
the
seven
months
period
are
protected
by
their
right
to
recover
reparations
or
by
the
normal
refund
provisions
of
the
commissions
attached
under
157.
now
with
that
preface,
i
should
like
to
state
what
i
think
happened
in
this
case
and
what
the
real
pragmatic
consequences
to
take
mr.
springer's
words
over
this
commission
orders
were.
as
it's
been
said
the
case
started
with
a
petition
asking
for
leave
to
file
a
single
master
tariff
which
the
commission
granted.
now,
no
review
has
been
sought
of
that
order
and
after
they
got
the
permission,
the
railroads
filed
a
tariff
which
i
think
was
to
become
effective
on
the
24th
of
june
1968.
it
had
to
make
it
that
far
ahead
because
the
commission
has
a
condition
of
getting
the
permission
requiring
it
to
do
so.
the
first
thing
that
the
commission
did
was
to
suspend
that
first
master
tariff
for
the
entire
seven
months
period
and
at
the
same
time
however,
it
said
to
the
railroads
“now
if
you
want
to
file
another
tariff
that
makes
only
a
3%
increase.”
the
increases
in
the
master
tariffs
have
been
three
to
six,
said
to
the
railroads
“if
you
wish
to
file
another
tariff,
it
makes
only
a
3%
increase,
we
will
not
suspend
that
tariff.”
and
the
railroads
did
so
and
that
3%
tariff
went
into
effect,
and
the
time
the
commission
did
this,
it
said
to
the
railroads
in
effect
in
its
order
“now
we
are
investigating
this
matter
and
we
may
decide
later
on
that
we
should
have
suspended
these
rates
even
as
to
the
3%
and
if
we
decide
that
we
should
have
done
that
as
to
any
or
all
of
these
rates,
then
you
are
going
to
have
to
restore
the
situation
to
what
it
would
have
been
if
we
had
suspended
the
rates
by
making
refunds.”
the
next
thing
that
the
commission
did
was
to
issue
an
issue
an
order
in
november
which
has
been
called
its
interim
order
and
in
that
order
it
decided
in
effect
that
it
should
not
have
suspended
the
any
part
of
the
rate
increase
and
that
it
would
permit
the
entire
rate
increase
to
go
in
to
effect
at
the
end
of
november.
at
the
same
time
again
saying
to
these
carriers
and
a
way
it
did
that
again
was
to
say
“you
can
file
another
tariff”
which
the
railroads
did
which
put
the
additional
3%
into
effect.
at
the
same
time,
it
said
to
the
railroads
“we're
still
looking
at
this
and
when
we
come
to
our
final
conclusion,
if
we
decide
that
we
should
have
suspended
some
or
all
of
these
rates
for
the
entire
statutory
period,
you
are
going
to
have
to
restore
the
situation
to
what
it
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
such
a
suspension.”
and
in
the
end
there
in
january
it
issued
a
final
order
in
which
it
said
some
of
these
rates,
few
of
them,
i
think
there
are
about
nine
instances
should
have
been
suspended
otherwise
we
think
that
our
orders
can
stand.
so
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
issue
in
this
case,
my
view
of
what's
happened
is
simply
whether
an
order
of
the
commission
which
refuses
to
suspend
a
proposed
rate
increase
for
the
entire
seven
months
period
but
does
not
determine
the
lawfulness
of
all
or
any
of
the
rates
involved
but
leaves
that
to
be
determined
in
subsequent
proceedings
is
reviewable.
because
we
believe
that
was
the
only
consequence
of
what
this
commission
did
here.
to
put
the
matter
in
other
way,
we
say
that
what
the
actual
pragmatic
effect
of
these
orders
does
not
differ
significantly
from
an
order
that
a
commission
enters
in
any
ordinary
suspension
case
in
which
it
refuses
to
suspend
rates
for
all
or
any
part
or
some
part
of
the
seven
months
suspension
period.
now,
we
believe
that
an
order
of
that
kind
which
we
think
this
order
is,
should
not
be
reviewable
and
our
reasons
rest
both
upon
analysis
of
statute
and
upon
certain
practical
considerations.
the
commission
has
been
issuing
these
general
revenue
orders
for
more
than
50
years
and
in
the
line
of
cases
that
we
have
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief
from
pages
24
to
25.
the
courts
have
held
that
these
orders
are
not
reviewable
and
that
the
shipper
has
an
adequate
remedy
by
way
of
complaint
and
reparation.
the
courts
have
also
held
relates
to
what
i
said
a
moment
ago
about
the
effect
of
this
order
and
its
relationship
to
a
suspension
proceedings
and
they
have
held
i
think
uniformly
that
an
order
of
the
commission
that
refuses
to
suspend
rates
is
not
reviewable.
now,
both
of
these
lines
of
cases,
those
cases
by
the
way
are
collected
in
the
opinion
in
long
island
case
in
193
federal
sub
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
at
least
the
cases
up
to
1961.
since
that
time
there
have
been
a
number
of
other
cases
refusing
to
review,
orders
that
refuse
to
suspend.
now
both
of
these
groups
of
cases,
those
that
are
refused
to
review
the
general
revenue
orders
and
those
that
have
refused
to
review
the
orders
declining
to
suspend,
to
examine
the
opinions.
it
seems
to
me
to
rest
on
two
related
considerations,
one
rests
on
the
structure
of
the
act
and
particularly
on
section
157
because
it
seems
clear
and
this
was
the
purpose
of
my
preliminary
statement
that
under
that
section,
the
question
whether
the
commission
should
interfere
with
the
timing
of
a
proposed
rate
increase
by
suspending
the
rates
is
not
a
matter
that
is
appropriate
for
judicial
review
because
it
is
committed
to
the
commission's
discretion.
the
commission
when
it
refuses
to
suspend
a
rate
is
not
required
to
make
any
findings,
not
required
by
the
statute
to
have
any
hearing,
it's
not
required
to
give
anybody
any
reasons
for
its
action.
the
statute
permits
it
to
do
that
and
along
ago
in
the
board
against
the
great
northern
case
which
i
think
is
281
u.s.
the
court
--
this
court
said
that
the
power
suspension
is
entrusted
to
congress
or
to
the
commission
only.
now,
we
submit
when
you
look
at
this,
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
practical
considerations
in
a
moment
but
when
you
look
at
this
body
of
authority
and
consider
it
has
existed
with
the
length
of
time
that
it
has,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
it
in
the
case
of
these
general
revenue
determinations.
they
do
not
and
i
will
discuss
this
point
in
a
moment
also,
they
do
not
determine
the
lawfulness
at
any
or
all
of
these
rates
but
railroads
may
increase
as
a
result
of
the
order
and
as
i
think
they
do
not
preclude
the
shipper
from
litigating
any
issue
that
is
relevant
in
any
section
13
proceeding.
these
orders,
and
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
this.
now,
i
think
it
is
clear,
do
not
determine
the
lawfulness
of
any
of
the
rates
and
i'm
not
sure
that
appellants
dispute
that
fact
but
there
isn't
any
room
to
dispute
it
because
the
commission
says
right
in
its
report
that
it
is
not
determining
that
any
of
these
rates
are
reasonable
rates
that
everyone
of
them
is
subject
to
correction
and
that
they
are
in
all
respects
and
i
emphasize
in
all
respects
and
this
is
the
commission's
language.
they
all
are
in
all
respects
subject
to
complaint
and
investigation
and
again
long
ago,
this
court
in
the
brimstone
case
and
talking
about
orders
of
the
very
kind
that
are
here
involved
said
“those
orders
do
not
approve
or
fix
any
rate,
they
do
not
determine
that
any
rate
is
reasonable.
they
do
not
approve
in
advance
any
rate
that
may
be
filed
as
a
result
of
the
orders.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
one
is
the
idea
that
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
other
idea
is
that
the
shipper
has
inadequate
remedy
under
the
complaint
proceeding
to
which
he
should
resort
before
seeking
judicial
review.
you'll
find
those
two
notions
implicit
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
i
have
difficulty
i
must
confess
to
the
court
with
a
concept
of
finality.
it's
always
a
question
of
what
order
is
final
about.
now
i
would
--
i'd
be
prepared
to
concede
that
this
order
is
final
so
far
as
it
refuses
to
suspend
rates
but
it
isn't
final
as
to
lawfulness
of
any
rate.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
prematurity.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
but
it's
a
combination
of
those
things
that
you
will
find
in
these
opinions
and
you
find
them
both
in
their
reach
in
the
opinions
that
relate
to
simple
refusals
to
suspend
and
any
opinions
that
have
to
do
with
the
general
revenue
orders.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh
yes.
that
seemed
to
be
(inaudible)
when
i
answer
this
question
because
i
have
recently
read
all
of
them.
the
first
general
revenue
proceeding
was
really
i
think
in
1910
or
1911
just
after
the
mann-
elkins
act
was
passed
but
i
would
say
that
this
form
of
proceeding
that
we
have
before
us
today,
really
began
after
the
transportation
act
of
1920
and
with
the
general
rate
increase
of
1920.
the
decisions
was
that
the
general
rate
proceedings
before
the
kaiser
war
are
i
think
in
somewhat
a
different
category
but
after
1920
this
thing
developed
until
it
--
and
by
early
in
the
30's
it
reached
about
kind
of
form
and
substance
it
now
has.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
this
is
an
administrative
mechanism
which
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes
sir.
you
might
save
to
paraphrase
sir
henry
that
it's
been
secreted
in
the
interspecies
of
the
procedure
that
is
provided
by
section
157
but
it's
quite
different
kind
of
development
that
rests
on
that
but
is
in
certain
respect
different.
i
may
say
since
you
have
raised
this
question
that
the
commission
itself
has
in
its
orders,
didn't
in
these
orders
but
in
the
other
general
revenue
orders,
it
is
recognized
the
--
what
i've
said
about
the
similarity
between
this
and
the
suspension
case
in
the
1920
general
rate
increase.
commissioner
eastman
in
his
concurring
opinion
said
“essentially
what
we
have
here
is
a
proceeding
like
a
suspension
proceeding.
there's
no
finality
about
it,
we're
just
deciding
whether
we
should
allow
these
rates
to
go
into
effect.
and
in
two
later
decisions,
i
get
--
i
cannot
be
certain
about
these
but
i
think
it
was
a
general
rate
increase
of
1958
and
the
general
rate
increase
in
1960,
the
commission
made
somewhat
comparable
statements
comparing
this
to
what
goes
on
in
ordinary
suspension
case.
i
think
in
one
of
those
opinions
they
quoted
a
mr.
eastmans's
statement
in
the
1920
case.
now,
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
position,
they
do
not
deny
that
they
have
another
remedy.
they
argued
that
the
remedy
is
not
adequate
and
so
far
as
i
could
understand,
i
think
that
argument
rests
essentially
on
the
contention
that
because
of
the
commission's
determinations
in
a
general
revenue
proceeding.
they
will
be
precluded
either
by
something
like
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
as
a
practical
matter
from
re-litigating
these
issues
or
relevant
issues
in
a
complaint
proceeding.
now,
we
submit
that
they
are
simply
wrong
about
that
and
that
there
is
no
warrant
in
authority
or
logic
or
in
the
commission
precedent
or
practice
for
the
view
they
take.
i
think,
i
should
say
this
in
candor
about
these
general
revenue
determinations
that
are
made
in
a
general
revenue
order.
they
relate
of
course
to
all
rates
and
to
all
carriers
as
a
group
and
they're
made
on
the
basis
of
typical
evidence
but
in
a
very
general
way.
now
the
determinations
that
the
commission
makes
on
that
kind
of
evidence
and
that
kind
of
proceeding
may
have
only
a
limited
relevance
in
a
proceeding
relating
to
particular
rates
but
although
in
commission
in
those
proceedings
does
often
give
consideration
to
revenue
needs
of
the
carriers.
sometimes
in
general
terms,
sometimes
simply
in
terms
of
the
revenue
needs
as
related
to
the
particular
traffic
involved.
but
of
course
that
–
these
revenue
needs
in
a
particular
rate
proceeding
have
only
one
several
factor.
the
commission
has
often
told
the
railroads
that
they
can't
justify
a
rate
--
particular
rate
just
because
they
need
money.
they
have
to
justify
it
--
it's
reasonableness
on
other
grounds
and
the
commission
looks
at
comparisons
with
comparable
rates,
with
a
nature
of
commodity,
with
a
cost
involved,
to
what
degree
there
is
competition.
whereby
other
modes
of
transportation,
the
suggestion
that
these
particular
rate
cases
that
commission
doesn't
examine
the
problem
of
diversions,
this
i
think
as
mistaken
and
look
at
all
they
seem.
now
to
the
extent
that
any
issue
that
is
determined
on
revenue
needs
or
anything
else
is
relevant
in
a
particular
rate
proceeding,
complaint
proceeding.
we
submit
that
the
commission
will
look
at
it,
the
shipper
is
not
precluded
from
raising
it
and
litigating
it
and
getting
entitled
to
have
judicial
review
of
any
determination
the
commission
makes
about
it.
now
they
have
cited
this,
there
had
been
some
discussions
of
koppers
case,
303
icc,
i
think
mr.
springer
is
quite
candid
in
indicating
and
i
joined
with
him
that
no
one
quite
knows
what
that
murky
passage
in
the
opinion
means.
i
think
i
know
what
it
means
but
i
can't
be
sure
about.
i
think
all
it
meant
was
that
the
commission
wasn't
going
to
litigate
in
that
case
whether
it
made
a
mistake
in
refusing
to
suspend
the
rates.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
koppers
case,
yes,
i
think
that's
what
it
means.
there
are
other
cases
and
we
have
cited
them
in
our
brief,
one
is
the
gold
soap
case
where
the
railroads
try
to
justify
a
rate
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
issued
pursuant
to
a
general
revenue
order.
and
the
commission
said
“no,
you
can't
do
that,
that's
no
justification
whatsoever
to
this
rate.
we
didn't
approve
this
rate,
we
didn't
fix
this
rate,
you
have
got
to
justify
it”
and
i
think
what
is
more
significant
is
that
the
commission
has
awarded
reparation.
bound
rates
were
unjust
to
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
awarded
reparation
with
respect
to
rates
that
were
established
pursuant
to
these
general
revenue
orders
and
when
the
carry
railroad
who
tried
to
argue
that
those
orders
of
justification
for
the
rates
that
commission
has
said
“no,”
they
are
not
a
justification
and
at
least
in
one
instance
the
court
said
that
that
was
quite
correct.
that's
the
cotton
valley
oil
company
case,
i
think
which
is
against
the
southern
railway
which
i
think
is
in
51
federal
supplement.
so
as
a
practical
matter
and
i
accept
the
pragmatic
test
has
a
practical
matter
in
these
complaint
proceedings,
even
though
the
rate
is
at
the
level
fixed
by
or
level
that
the
railroads
is
fixed
pursuant
to
some
general
revenue
order.
the
commission
has
looked
at
the
rates,
held
they
were
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
given
the
shippers
reparation.
now
i
must
confess
that
i
am
not
altogether
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
altogether
understand
the
argument
that
the
appellant
made
on
this
point
of
the
adequacy
of
remedy.
they
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
did
say
in
its
report
when
it
decided
that
not
to
suspend
these
rates
for
a
full
period
that
it
found
that
the
general
level
of
the
rates
was
be
just
and
reasonable.
filed
an
statement
which
it
immediately
qualified
by
saying
we're
only
talking
about
the
general
basis
of
the
rates.
we're
not
holding
that
any
of
the
rates
are
lawful
and
they
are
all
subject
to
investigation
and
complaint
in
all
respects.
but
then
the
appellants
say
that
in
a
complaint
proceeding
they
can't
attack
the
general
level
of
these
rates.
and
at
that
point,
either
because
of
some
weakness
of
the
flesh
or
infirmity
of
the
mind,
i
cannot
follow
because
i
had
assumed
perhaps
in
blindness
that
what
a
shipper
pays
is
the
rate
that
is
applicable
to
his
shipments
and
his
commodities.
he
doesn't
pay
any
general
rate
level
and
that
under
the
statute,
if
he
has
a
remedy
that
will
give
him
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
which
he
has
in
this
case
that
that
satisfies
the
statute
and
if
he
gets
judicial
review
in
that
proceeding
that
that
is
an
adequate
remedy.
now
i
think
if
you
look
and
you
could
only
do
what
i
think
by
random
sampling,
you
will
see
that
when
the
commission
determines
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
particular
rates.
this
abstraction
of
the
general
rate
level
does
not
have
any
weight
in
these
deliberations.
it
considers
and
deals
with
those
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
including
the
revenue
needs
that
the
evidence
before
it
and
it
relates
to
those
rates
and
to
the
extent
as
far
as
i
can
tell
reading
from
reading
the
reports
of
the
commission
that
it
relies
on
president,
it
relies
only
on
cases
in
which
it
has
actually
prescribed
or
determined
that
a
rate
that
is
lawful.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
same
rates
or
possibly
higher
rates.
now
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
in
discussing
reviewability,
i
was
going
to
come
to
the
practical
considerations
that
we
think
supports
our
analytical
argument
based
on
the
statute.
first
to
those
practical
considerations
has
to
do
with
this
matter
of
injunctive
relief.
now,
i
have
to
say
that
in
discussing
these
problems,
i
find
them
very
puzzling
and
that
i
feared
going
to
be
more
adept
of
raising
them
and
i
am
answering
them.
the
trouble
is
that
because
these
general
revenue
orders
are
never
been
reviewed
and
the
orders
refusing
to
suspend
rates
have
never
been
reviewed.
there
simply
is
many
precedent
where
this
is
a
very
uncharted
line
of
country.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
is
inappropriate
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right
or
you
could
say
this,
say
we
had
a
look
at
them
and
doesn't
appear
to
us
as
any
reason
why
we
should
suspend
them
for
the
full
statutory
period.
we
will
allow
them
to
go
in
effect
and
they'll
determine
whether
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
odd
thing
is
mr.
justice
white
that
in
an
ordinary
suspension
case
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
do
say
that.
they
use
this
same
kind
of
justness
and
reasonableness
language.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
a
specific
rate
cases
although
if
there's
anything
it's
well
settled.
it
is
that
when
they
suspend
or
refuse
to
misspend
a
rate
they
are
not
making
any
determination
about
its
lawfulness.
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
a
case
where
they
used
that
kind
of
language
in
a
specific
rate
case,
i
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
no.
this
bureaucratic
language
tends
to
repeat
itself
when
they
ship
from
place
to
place
some
times
without
too
much
consideration
whether
it's
appropriate
but
they
use
this
just
and
reasonable
language
even
in
an
ordinary.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
can
do
that,
they
don't
have
to
say
anything
and
they
can
do
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
one
of
the
success,
the
rate
increases
that
followed
this
one.
the
one
in
1969,
they
just
--
they
let
that
go
into
effect
at
once.
they
refused
to
investigate
anything
except
questions
of
discrimination
and
preference.
they
wouldn't
investigate
reasonableness
and
they
did
this
in
an
order
that's
a
page
and
a
half,
they
didn't
go
through
this
elaborate
discussion
to
make
these
findings
and
all
these
reasons
and
under
the
statute
they
can
do
that.
they
have
developed
a
practice
over
the
years
of
writing
these
elaborate
dissertations
in
these
general
revenue
cases
and
this
and
why
they
used
the
language
in
the
suspension
cases,
i
could
not
attempt
to
explain
but
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
problem
of
injunctive
relief.
i
think
the
appellants
have
not
quite
met
the
real
problem
there
which
is
a
problem
i
think
that
suggests
that
the
kind
of
relief
that
they
really
want
on
judicial
review
can't
be
obtained
without
doing
violence
to
the
statutory
plan.
now
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this,
these
general
rate
proceedings
frequently
consume
a
large
part
of
the
statutory
seven
months
suspension
period
and
people
can't
go
into
court
until
the
commission
is
finished.
now
when
somebody
goes
into
court
and
wants
interlocutory
relief
and
it's
natural
for
him
to
do
so
because
that's
one
of
the
purpose
of
judicial
review.
the
court
is
going
to
be
faced
with
a
problem
of
whether
it
can
enjoin
the
rate
increase
beyond
the
seven
months
period.
because
in
some
cases
by
the
time
they
get
to
court,
the
seven
months
period
will
expire
or
nearly
expire
and
the
same
question
will
arise
as
to
and
it
was
raised
this
morning
i
think
or
after
lunch
as
to
what
the
court
does
after
a
final
hearing.
if
it
finds
that
there
was
some
infirmity
in
the
commissions
order,
does
it
enjoin
the
rates
for
more
than
seven
months
period?
now,
the
position
of
the
railroads
is
that
neither
the
commission
nor
a
court
even
as
an
incident
to
judicial
review
can
enjoin
or
suspend
rates
if
not
been
adjudicated
to
be
unlawful
as
such
beyond
the
seven
months
period.
but
the
law
on
that
point
is
not
yet
clear
and
what
the
railroads
with
a
reason
apprehend
is
that
first
it
can't
be
certain
how
the
question
must
be
settled
and
second
until
the
question
is
settled
and
settled
applies
--
as
soon
a
way
that
applies
to
all
the
possible
situations
that
these
general
rate
increases
are
going
to
be
indefinitely
delayed
in
many
cases
beyond
the
seven
months
period
by
interlocutory
and
final
injunction.
as
has
been
observed
these
suits
can
be
brought
in
any
district
in
the
country,
they
could
involve
different
commodities,
different
shippers,
different
argument
could
be
made
about
the
general
rate
increase.
the
government
recognizes
this
problem
and
it's
attempted
to
make
some
palatine
suggestions
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
those
suggestions.
consider
all
of
them
you
can
see
that
it
is
not,
they
are
not
likely
to
really
solve
this
problem.
and
of
course
if
the
problem
as
i
cannot
get
relief
beyond
the
seven
months
period
which
is
our
position,
then
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
judicial
review
i
suppose
is
gone
at
this
point.
the
judicial
review
of
these
orders
also
creates
a
difficult
problem
about
the
refund
provisions
of
the
commission's
general
revenue
orders.
now
we
have
discussed
that
matter
in
our
brief
and
i
should
like
to
refer
the
court
to
that
discussion.
i
simply
like
to
say
this
about
it
that
that
is
a
difficulty
that
arises
because
these
refund
provisions
and
these
general
revenue
orders
are
little
peculiar.
unlike
the
normal
refund
provision
in
an
ordinary
section
157
case.
they
do
not
come
in
to
operation
or
the
operation
does
not
depend
i
should
say
upon
a
final
determination
that
that
the
particular
rates
are
unlawful.
their
operation
simply
depends
upon
the
determination
by
the
commission
that
it
made
a
mistake
in
allowing
the
rates
to
become
effective
or
not
to
suspend
the
rates.
so
that
under
these
provisions
the
railroads
could
and
do
at
times
have
to
refund
money
that
they
have
collected
from
rates
that
are
never
been
determined
to
be
unlawful
and
which
they
have
to
be
determined
to
be
unlawful
simply
because
the
commission
has
determined
that
the
rate
should
have
been
suspended.
now
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
these
refunds
i
am
speaking
of
are
refunds
that
the
commission
attaches
as
condition
to
its
refusal
to
suspend
the
rates.
mr.

and
when
the
railroads
take
advantage
of
that
refusal
of
course,
they
have
to
accept
the
conditions.
they
are
bound
by
them.
now
if
these
refunds
is
here
to
for,
there's
been
uncertainty
about
these
refunds
but
the
railroads
have
at
least
been
certain
that
the
time
within
which
the
liability
would
accumulate
would
be
limited
at
the
time
that
the
commission
was
required
to
consider
the
matter.
and
while
there
was
uncertainty
it
was
an
uncertainty
that
arose
from
the
uncertainties
about
what
one
agency
would
do.
now
there
has
to
be
judicial
review
of
these
orders,
of
course
the
times
in
which
this
uncertainty
will
continue
and
that
length
of
time
in
which
these
contingent
liabilities
will
accumulate
will
be
extended
and
the
uncertainties
will
be
increased
by
the
facts
that
there
you
have
two
agencies
and
instead
of
one
and
his
views
on
these
matter
may
differ.
now
that
means
that
when
the
railroads
get
a
general
rate
increase
if
there
is
to
be
judicial
review,
they
are
going
to
have
a
very
great
problem
about
whether
they
can
use
this
money
or
how
much
of
it
they
can
use
or
whether
they
have
to
setup
a
contingent
reserve
to
take
care
of
this
contingent
liability.
they
can't
very
well
plan
or
make
definitive
plan
that
may
hamper
the
ability
to
use
the
money
for
permanent
purposes.
in
the
present
cash
position
of
many
of
the
railroads
this
is
rather
a
serious
problem.
i
have
so
far
in
this
argument
talked
about
the
commission's
order
simply
in
terms
of
what
its
consequences
are
on
the
general
level
of
rates
or
on
rates
generally.
i
would
now
like
to
say
something
about
the
--
i
think
a
minor
point
really
about
the
provisions
of
the
orders
that
grant
relief
under
the
fourth
section
and
from
outstanding
order.
those
provisions
of
the
order
affect
only
a
very
small
number
of
the
rates
and
they
do
not
have
much
economic
significance.
i
am
told
that
the
rate
experts
in
the
rate
conferences
say
that
even
without
that
relief,
they
could
generally
achieve
the
economic
results
of
a
--
one
of
the
general
revenue
orders
by
excluding
those
rates
and
making
them
the
subject
of
separate
proceedings.
but
for
purposes
of
this
afternoon
i'm
going
to
assume
that
orders
that
grant
fourth
section
relief
and
it
relieve
from
outstanding
orders
are
in
an
appropriate
case
reviewable
but
my
submission
is
that
this
in
this
case,
it
is
not,
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
to
review
the
provisions
of
those
provisions
of
the
orders
that
are
here
before
the
court.
the
appellants
here
haven't
not
alleged
in
any
of
the
named
appellants
are
affected
in
any
degree
by
those
provisions.
they
have
not
argued
that
they
are
affected
and
when
you
look
at
their
arguments,
they
aren't
directed
to
fourth
section
problems
or
to
any
problems
that
arise
under
outstanding
rate
orders.
they're
directed
to
the
general
revenue
determinations
of
the
commission
in
a
way
that
it
made
them.
now
in
a
precisely
similar
situation,
one
of
the
algoma
case
in
11
federal
supplement
where
the
same
kind
of
an
argument
that
was
made,
the
court
said
“well
these
shippers
haven't
shown
they're
affected,
these
provisions
are
simply
incidental
to
the
main
purpose
of
the
order
and
we
won't
refuse
them
and
we
submit
that
that
should
be
the
conclusion
here.”
i
am
not
going
to
say
anything
about
the
assertion
that
some
of
these
appellants
represent
all
shippers,
all
commodities
in
the
united
states
except
to
say
that
in
this,
there
is
some
--
this
vague
indication
that
who
these
members
of
this
enormous
class
maybe
and
that
are
affected
by
the
fourth
section
orders.
i
shouldn't
think
that
justify
judicial
review.
and
finally
if
the
court
should
think
that
it
has
to
look
at
that
part
of
these
orders
and
i
suggest
that
the
review
should
extend
only
to
those
rates
that
are
covered
by
the
fourth
section
provisions
and
the
relief
from
outstanding
orders
and
not
extend
to
the
generality
of
rates
or
the
general
revenue
determination
that
are
here
involved.
i
think
that
i
should
like
to
conclude
by
saying
something
about
the
merits
of
this
case,
we
have
asked
this
court
if
it
--
and
the
unhappy
event
that
it
should
determine
that
these
orders
are
reviewable
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
orders
and
affirm
them.
now,
we
knew
and
we
made
that
request
that
this
court
has
often
said
that
will
not
or
is
it
reluctant
to
consider
agency
orders,
findings
that
have
not
been
reviewed
by
lower
court.
but
that
i
assume
is
not
a
iron-clad
rule
and
this
court
has
sometimes
departed
from
it.
and
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
there
are
very
urgent
and
powerful
considerations
in
the
present
situation
that
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
determine
the
validity
of
this
order.
for
one
thing
this
contingent
liability
under
the
refund
provisions
is
accumulating.
it
accumulates
possibly
at
the
rate
of
400
million
dollars
a
year
and
if
the
railroads
are
going
to
have
to
give
some
or
all
of
that
back,
it
seems
to
me
the
sooner
they
know
about
it
better.
but
apart
from
that
as
it
has
been
stated.
there
have
been
three
rate
increases
since
this
rate
increase
that
is
here
involved
and
in
the
showing
that
the
railroads
made
to
the
commission
on
those
rate
increases.
they
of
course
assume
the
availability
of
this
rate
increase
and
the
income
it
produces
and
presumably
in
granting
relief
of
the
commission
itself
assumed
the
same
thing.
now,
again
if
this
rate
increase
has
to
be
invalidated
in
some
way
or
the
railroads
are
going
to
have
to
give
back
any
or
all
of
the
large
amounts
of
money
involved,
the
sooner
the
railroads
and
i
should
suppose
the
commission
know
that
the
better
so
that
they
can
decide
whether
they
have
to
take
any
steps
in
view
of
that
situation
with
respect
to
the
revenue
situation
of
the
railroad.
now,
as
far
as
the
merits
are
concerned,
we
argue
them
in
our
briefs
and
in
its
reply
the
appellants
in
alabama
power
made
an
argument
on
the
merits.
the
appellants
in
the
atlantic
city
case
have
refused
to
argue
in
their
briefs
in
this
court
although
we
tendered
the
issue
to
them.
but
they
insisted
that
there
be
included
in
the
appendix,
a
memorandum
that
they
submitted
to
the
district
court
below
and
that
memorandum
contains
their
arguments
on
the
merits
so
they
are
before
the
court.
now
we
have
discussed
this
matter
of
the
merits
to
the
commission's
order
in
detail
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
merely
like
to
say
this.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
appellants
arguments
and
consider
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
was
here
involved
which
was
a
proceeding
as
i
have
said
really
is
essentially
devoted
to
the
question
whether
these
rates
should
be
suspended
for
the
whole
seven
months
period.
that
those
arguments
do
not
provide
any
basis
for
over
turning
the
commissions'
judgment,
apart
from
certain
procedural
arguments
which
really
relate
to
how
the
commission
manages
its
internal
business,
they
are
simply
arguments
that
attack
the
commission's
judgment
on
the
evidence
on
the
weight
it
gave
to
conflicting
evidence
on
the
inferences
and
conclusions
it
drew
from
the
evidence
and
on
the
wisdom
of
its
final
determination
not
to
spend
these
rates
for
the
entire
seven
months
period.
i
think
the
arguments
that
are
set
forth
in
the
reply
of
the
alabama
power
appellants
indicate
that
they
say
the
commission
shouldn't
have
authorized
it
nationwide,
that
it
shouldn't
have
used
1966
as
a
test
year
for
the
increase
in
the
expenses
and
other
arguments
that
kind
of
matters
about
which
reasonable
men
may
differ
but
there
are
also
matters
as
to
which
the
commission
has
an
area
of
judgment
and
which
its
judgment
i
suppose
will
be
respected
unless
it's
shown
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
i
think
when
you
read
the
commission's
report
in
this
case.
the
interim
report,
the
final
report,
the
parent
commission
considered
all
the
evidence,
gave
a
reasoned
statement
for
its
conclusions
and
i
think
it
is
not
impermissible
for
me
to
say
at
this
point
finally,
that
anyone
who
reads
the
facts
that
are
set
forth
in
the
commission's
reports
in
three
succeeding
general
increase
cases.
that
have
come
along
since
these
orders
are
involved.
anyone
who
looks
to
those
reports
and
reads
the
facts
they
will
contain,
they
contain
i
think
would
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that
when
the
commission
decided
in
1968
that
the
railroads
were
in
immediate
and
drastic
need
of
increased
freight
revenue.
that
experience
has
shown
that
the
commission
was
not
acting
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
when
on
the
basis
of
that
conclusion.
it
declined
to
differ
or
suspend
this
rate
increase.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there
have
been
i
think
around
15
mr.
justice
harlan
of
course
some
of
those
orders
have
involved
more
than
one
report
and
are
reported
in
more
than
one
place
because
some
of
them
went
on
for
a
time.
i
once
had
them
all
on
a
book
rack
and
it
was
a
depressing
sight
there
that
many
of
them
but
i
think
there
have
been
12
or
15
of
them.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
the
cases
since
1920
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
present
recollection
is
maybe
a
little
blurred
that
i
think
they
have
usually
involved
all
the
railroads.
now
before
1920,
my
recollection
is
that
there
were
some
cases
which
involved
only
the
eastern
railroads,
and
some
cases
which
involved
only
the
western
railroads
but
i
feel
thoroughly
confident
that
in
the
last
20
years,
they
have
involved
all
the
railroads.
now
sometimes
the
railroads
ask
for
different
amounts
increases
and
they
may
have
filed
different
applications
but
when
the
commission
gets
to
consider
them
and
usually
treats
as
one
big
decision.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
i
will
tell
you
what
i
meant
was
precisely
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
somewhat
clear
recollection
of
the
cases
since
about
1950
than
i
have
with
the
cases
before
that
and
i
--
there
may
have
been
some
cases
that
before
that
where
perhaps
not
all
the
railroads
were
involved.
but
i
think
since
1920
and
most
of
them
i
remember
they
were
all
the
railroads
in
the
united
states.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
thought
i
prepared
thoroughly
but
i
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it's
not
one
of
large.
thank
you.
