justice
potter
stewart
i
apologize
for
interrupting
you
right
at
the
threshold
of
your
argument.
but
you
come
from
a
different
court.
it's
dismissed
all
of
your
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
suggests
that
if
your
view
is
correct,
then
every
single
district
court
in
the
nation
could
be
asked
by
a
shipper
to
review
this
commission
determination.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
in
every
federal
district
in
the
country.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
didn't
--
i
say
apologize
again
for
interrupting
you
right
at
the
beginning
but
that
is
one
of
the
matters
frankly
that
i
had
questions
about,
that
is
this
about
how
many
district
courts
there
are,
86,
a
100
and
whatever
it
is
and
also
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
statute
of
limitations.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
hope
that
in
due
course
in
your
arguments
you
would.
justice
potter
stewart
the
commission
itself
as
i
understand
it
in
the
koppers
company
case
303
interstate
commerce
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
in
a
later
proceeding
attacking
a
specific
rate,
the
general
authorization
or
a
rate
increase
is
just
not
at
all
relevant,
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
simply
declined
to
consider
it.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
to
oppose
or
to
admit
any
evidence
or
argument
about
it
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
the
commission
declined
to
give
you
that
much
to
reconsider
even
perform
reconsideration,
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
well
be
many
more
than
just
two
courts,
couldn't
it?
it
could
be
in
every
district
court
in
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
very
easily.
i
mean
that's
not
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
hypothesis
at
all
because
they're
obviously
shippers
in
every
federal
district
are
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
say
a
single
three-judge
court
disposed
of
it
must
prevent
another
shipper
thereafter
bring
a
brand
new
proceeding
in
another
three-judge
court
in
some
other
district.
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
i
understand
and
it
would
not
be
res
judicata.
justice
potter
stewart
and
along
with
there
will
be
equal
protection,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
confidential
value?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
res
judicata?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cox.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
you
told
us
that
this
body
of
authority
with
respect
to
the
non-reviewability
of
refusal
to
suspend
is
based
upon
two
foundations?
justice
potter
stewart
one
157?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
the
other
idea?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
slap
over
under
non
finality
i
suppose
or
some
sort
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
or
prematurity
--
justice
potter
stewart
some
lack
of
maturity.
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
i
have
interrupted
you,
i
think
you
told
us
that
this
--the
general
revenue
orders
go
back
50
years
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
really
a
procedure
not
--
certainly
not
explicitly
contemplated
by
the
legislation,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
based
upon
necessity
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
telling
about
the
koppers
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
those,
generally
they
didn't
say
anything
in
the
suspending
or
refusing
to
suspend.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cox
can
you
say
off
hand
how
many
general
revenue
orders
have
there
been
since
1920
or
whatever
the
beginning
date
was?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
always
involve
all
the
railroads
or
just
--
or
sometimes
just
a
group
of
railroads
or
railroads
of
certain
region?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
aberdeen
and
rockfish
railroads?
justice
potter
stewart
i
