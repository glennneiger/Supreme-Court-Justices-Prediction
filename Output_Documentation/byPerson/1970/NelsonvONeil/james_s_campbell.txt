mr.
james
s.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
evidence
of
an
oral,
unrecorded
statement
reportedly
made
by
a
suspect
during
custodial
interrogation,
a
statement
that
accuses
another
person
of
participation
in
a
crime,
a
statement
reported
in
court
by
an
investigating
officer
who
conducted
the
interrogation.
this
is
unreliable
evidence.
it's
one
of
the
most
unreliable
forms
of
evidence
known
to
the
law.
yet,
it
is
also
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
the
unreliable
evidence
is
the
evidence
of
the
statement,
this
alleged
statement.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes
i
will
mr.
chief
justice.
this
evidence
in
addition
to
being
unreliable
is
also
devastating.
it's
powerfully
incriminating
evidence
as
this
court
described
it
in
bruton.
this
unreliability
and
this
devastating
impact
are
the
two
most
important
factors
to
keep
in
mind
in
determining
whether
o'neil
had
in
this
case
an
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine
his
accuserd.
in
other
kinds
of
cases,
involving
other
kinds
of
evidence,
dying
declarations,
spontaneous
declarations,
documentary
evidence
of
one
kind
or
another,
business
records,
it
may
well
be
that
something
less
than
the
fullest
and
most
effective
cross-examination
will
suffice
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
confrontation
clause.
but
if
there's
any
evidence
as
to
which
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
the
true
and
full
measure
of
cross-examination.
it
is
the
highly
unreliable
and
powerfully
incriminating
evidence
which
went
before
the
jury
that
convicted
o'neil.
now,
o'neil
did
not
have
a
full
and
effective
opportunity
to
cross-examine
all
the
witnesses
against
him,
for
the
alleged
maker
of
this
devastating
out
of
court
accusation,
flatly
denied
having
made
the
statement.
fully
effective
cross-examination
of
an
out
of
court
accusation
of
this
type,
can
occur
only
when
the
witness
to
whom
the
statement
is
attributed,
affirms
the
statement
in
court,
so
that
the
accused
can
probe
its
truthfulness
by
all
the
many
lines
of
attack
that
we
include
under
the
head
of
cross-examination.
this
principle
is
established
in
the
case
at
bar
as
govern
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
douglas
against
alabama
and
bruton
against
the
united
states.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
if
he
admitted
the
genuineness
of
the
statement.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
but
he
denied
the
truthfulness
of
the
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i'm
just
merely
trying
to
get
clear
on
the
hypothetical
situation.
i
assume
you're
posing
the
case
where
the
witness
admits
making
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
then
there
are
two
further
facts
which
may
change
the
result.
thus,
he
then
say,
?i
deny
now,
what
i
said
then.
what
i
said
was
not
true?
or
does
he
say,
?and
furthermore
what
i
said
was
true.?
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
to
the
extent
that
he
admits
making
the
statement,
but
denies
the
content
of
it.
now,
he
says
it's
genuine
but
that
it
wasn't
true,
then
you
have
the
situation
which
--
a
situation
which
the
united
states
is
amicus
curiae
in
green
said
there
would
be
effective
cross-examination
in
this
case.
the
united
states
in
green
took
the
position
that
where
there
was
a
flat
denial
of
the
statement
as
to
its
genuineness
and
its
truthfulness,
there
can
be
no
effective
cross-examination,
that's
our
case
here.
the
--
a
further
case
is
the
one
where
the
witness
admits
the
genuineness
of
the
statement
but
denies
its
truthfulness.
that
is
somewhat
more
like
that
green
case,
but
still
not
too
green.
the
third
situation
is
the
one
where
the
witness
affirms
making
the
statement,
and
he
affirms
the
truthfulness
of
what's
contained
in
there.
then,
he
essentially
incorporates
and
reproduces
the
accusations
in
court
and
at
that
point,
the
only
--
which
it
again,
not
our
case,
the
only
remaining
argument
against
the
admission
of
the
statement
under
those
circumstances
would
simply
be
a
straight
due
process
argument
that
despite
this
fact,
the
evidence
is
still
so
unreliable
that
the
traditional
exclusion
of
evidence
of
this
sort
is
required
as
a
constitutional
matter.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
the
purposes
of
cross
--
i
would
hesitate
mr.
chief
justice
to
try
to
encapsulate
here
for
you
all
the
purposes
of
cross-examination
as
this
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes,
these
are
certainly
among
the
purposes,
one
is
to
attack
the
credibility
of
the
witness
through
the
various
devices
which
are
encompassed
under
the
head
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
he
would
probably
not
cross-examine
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes,
he
did
not,
o'neil's
counsel
did
not
cross-examine
runnels.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
think
he
made
that
decision
because
he
realized
he
could
not
fully
effectively
cross-examine
the
really
damaging
evidence
in
this
case
by
addressing
questions
to
runnels.
the
most
that
he
could
hope
to
do
would
be
to
elicit
from
runnels
a
cumulative
repetition
of
the
denial
of
the
statement
which
runnels
had
already
made
on
examination
by
his
own
counsel.
the
notion
that
this
denial
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
this
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes.
there
was
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
officer.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
was
not
questioned.
he
was
not
cross-examined
by
o'neil's
counsel.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
i
do
not.
i
simply
say
that
that
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
officer
and
the
opportunity
to
address
further
questions
to
runnels
denying
the
statement,
do
not
amount
to
a
full
and
effective
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
most
damaging
evidence
in
this
case.
this
out
of
court
accusation
is
particularly
incriminating
and
particularly
unreliable
kind
of
evidence.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
this
witness,
runnels,
stated
that
he
never
made
such
a
statement.
he
denied
having
made
the
statement.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
could
not
be
effectively
cross-examined
on
this
statement
that
was
attributed
to
him
by
another.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
there
are
some
lines
of
questioning
which
could
be
addressed
to
the
officer
and
there
were
some
lines
of
questioning
which
were
addressed
to
the
officer
by
runnels'
counsel
and
that
is
no
substitute.
that
is
no
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct.
but
surely,
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
because
he
did
not
feel
that
he
had
anything
to
gain
by
attempting
to
question
that
officer.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
but
if
that
had
been
the
case,
if
that
had
been
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
i'm
not
complaining
about
that.
but
if
that
had
been
sufficient
cross-examination
of
this
out
of
court
accusation,
both
bruton
and
douglas
would
have
had
to
been
decided
otherwise.
in
douglas,
there
were
law
officers
on
the
stand
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
in
the
context
this
trial,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right.
he
did
not
exercise
his
opportunity
to
address
questions
to
either
of
those
witnesses.
the
point
is
that
that
opportunity
which
he
had,
which
he
admittedly
had
is
not
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
his
accusers
on
the
accusations
made
to
them.
it's
not
a
fully
effective
opportunity
to
do
that.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
can
accurately
cross-examine
his
accusers
if
his
accusers
come
in
to
open
court
and
give
their
accusations
in
open
court,
either
directly
at
that
point
or
by
affirming
the
accusation
and
incorporating
it
in
their
testimony,
pledging
their
credibility
to
witness
standing
behind
it
in
the
court.
that
is
--
that
is
confrontation
and
that
is
cross-examination.
and
i
urge
again,
that
this
requirement
of
full
and
effective
cross-examination
is
one
that
is
appropriate
to
evidence
of
this
kind.
and
if
i
may
return
for
just
a
moment
to
the
nature
of
this
evidence,
in
the
recent
case
here
of
dutton
against
evans,
the
plurality
opinion
was
able
to
identify
a
number
of
indicia
of
reliability
which
attached
to
the
spontaneous
remark
that
was
there
held
to
be
properly
admitted,
despite
the
fact
that
the
person
who
made
it
was
not
called
as
a
witness
at
all.
in
this
case
by
contrast,
one
can
identify
numerous
indicia
of
unreliability
that
attached
to
this
statement.
this
is
accomplice
testimony.
the
accomplice
was
under
arrest.
he
was
facing
prosecution.
he
made
a
self-serving.
he
allegedly
made
a
self-serving,
plain-shifting
statement.
he
was
in
the
coercive
atmosphere
of
custody.
he
--
they
--
a
common
interrogation
strategy
was
used
against
him,
giving
him
a
motive
to
accuse
his
fellow.
the
statement
was
reported
in
the
court
by
an
interested
party,
namely
the
investigating
officer
who
allegedly
received
the
statement.
there
was
no
other
officer
present.
there
was
no
other
person
present,
and
the
statement,
the
statement
is
oral
and
unrecorded.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
am
here
pointing
out
the
indicia
of
unreliability
that
is
attached
to
the
evidence
which
was
the
decisive
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
and
this
evidence
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
this
is
the
officer's
evidence
of
a
statement
attributed
to
runnels.
it
is
his
evidence
of
a
statement
by
runnels.
that
evidence,
that
evidence
has
this
indicia
of
unreliability
attached
to
it.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes.
i'm
saying
the
evidence
which
were
complaining
about
here
is
this
evidence
of
the
statement
which
is
the
officer's
evidence.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
and
to
the
extent
that
he
is
not
reporting
statements
of
this
kind,
then
he
can
be
cross-examined.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
think
it
has
a
close
affinity
to
due
process
arguments.
however,
i
do
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
i
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
only
in
the
sense
that
they
were
physically
present
in
the
court.
there
was
not
confrontation
in
the
sense
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
he
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
he
could
have.
he
couldn't
had
and
effective
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
accusation
against
him.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
if
the
statement
had
originally
been
given
at
a
time
when
it
was
subject
to
full
and
effective
cross-examination
as
the
statements
were
in
green
that
would
have
sufficed.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
the
statement
the
officer
waived
that
the
court
didn't
reached
that
statement.
the
statement
that
the
court
held,
could
have
been
improperly
admitted
at
the
trial.
it
was
the
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
green
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
green
--
in
green,
the
witness
conceded
giving
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
he
further
insisted
in
court
that
the
testimony
that
he
gave
was
the
truth,
as
he
then
believed
it.
and
he
further
insisted
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
he
couldn't
--
he
was
now
telling
the
truth
when
he
said
he
really
couldn't
remember
what
happened.
but
green
is
a
case
that
is
quite
different
from
this.
this
is
a
flat
denial
that
any
statement
was
made,
it's
genuineness
as
to
(inaudible)
than
its
truthfulness
is
denied.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
my
position
on
that
would
be
that
it
is
not
this
case,
there
is
a
further
opportunity.
we
come
closer
to
full
and
effective
cross-examination
in
that
case.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
i
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
under
confrontation,
given
this
kind
of
statement.
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
that
cannot
come
in
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
because
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right
and
if
we're
talking
about
this
kind
of
statement.
if
we're
talking
about
oral
unrecorded
statements
given
in
custody,
reported
to
police
officers
by
accomplices
with
the
motive
to
incriminate
others
that
we
have
here,
but
it
is
this
kind
of
evidence,
i
would
take
that
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
but
green
was
--
green
involved
--
if
green
would
have
to
--
some
of
the
discussion
in
green
would
have
to
more
close
limited
to
the
facts
if
the
position
that
i've
just
urged
were
to
be
held
to
be
still
open,
that's
correct.
however,
there
was
in
that
case
a
very
different
kind
of
statement.
it
was
in
principally
involved.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
this
gets
very
precisely
to
the
point
that
was
urged
by
petitioner
here
that
his
denial
is
that
best
thing
that
can
hoped
for
on
cross-examination.
that
is
simply
isn't
true.
runnels,
for
example
in
this
case,
runnels
self
interested
denial
that
he
made
the
statement,
whether
it's
true,
either
way,
is
far
less
persuasive
to
the
jury
than
many
of
the
results
that
cross-examination
might
have
achieved.
for
example,
by
showing
that
the
statement
was
motivated
by
anger
that
it
was
full
of
errors
and
inconsistencies,
runnels
denial
really
carries
no
more
weight
in
the
jury's
eyes
than
he
is
not
guilty
plea.
he
has
to
deny
the
statement
and
the
denial
is
no
substitute
for
cross-examination.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
you
certainly
do.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
you
certainly
do.
you
hope
that
it
will,
but
that
does
not
substitute
for
cross-examination.
it
does
not
substitute
for
what
you
can
get
in
terms
of
an
effective
probing
of
an
accusation
that's
made
in
court
by
an
accuser
who
is
there
in
court.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
if
one
where
to
have
an
accuser
in
court
and
to
subject
him
to
a
probing
cross-examination
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
according
to
the
police
officer,
he
is.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
is
not
an
accuser
then.
he
is
one
of
the
defendants.
he
is
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
stands
--
he
stands
at
that
point
in
the
dock,
accused
side
by
side
with
the
defendant,
and
he
can't
--
if
the
accuser
can't
be
cross-examine
by
addressing
questions
to
runnels.
finally
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
pardon?
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
have
the
rationale
of
douglas
against
alabama
and
bruton
against
the
united
states.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
the
holding,
the
holding.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
i
want
to
bring
this
case
back
to
the
kind
of
statement
and
the
kind
of
evidence
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
talking
about
a
classical
form
of
unreliable,
devastating
accusation.
that's
the
kind
of
evidence
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
you
can
get
the
probing
if
the
witness
who
makes
the
accusation
testifies
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
can't.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
they
should
--
that's
right.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
if
i
may,
the
procedure
that
should
be
followed
in
cases
like
this
is
the
procedure
that
mr.
justice
white
outlined
in
his
dissent
in
bruton
and
the
one
that
the
american
bar
association
project
and
(inaudible)
the
standards
for
criminal
justice
has
recommended.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
think
that
the
discussion
indicates
there's
a
--
is
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
evidence
of
an
oral,
unrecorded
statement
reportedly
made
by
a
suspect
during
custodial
interrogation,
a
statement
that
accuses
another
person
of
participation
in
a
crime,
a
statement
reported
in
court
by
an
investigating
officer
who
conducted
the
interrogation.
this
is
unreliable
evidence.
it's
one
of
the
most
unreliable
forms
of
evidence
known
to
the
law.
yet,
it
is
also
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
the
unreliable
evidence
is
the
evidence
of
the
statement,
this
alleged
statement.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes
i
will
mr.
chief
justice.
this
evidence
in
addition
to
being
unreliable
is
also
devastating.
it's
powerfully
incriminating
evidence
as
this
court
described
it
in
bruton.
this
unreliability
and
this
devastating
impact
are
the
two
most
important
factors
to
keep
in
mind
in
determining
whether
o'neil
had
in
this
case
an
adequate
opportunity
to
cross-examine
his
accuserd.
in
other
kinds
of
cases,
involving
other
kinds
of
evidence,
dying
declarations,
spontaneous
declarations,
documentary
evidence
of
one
kind
or
another,
business
records,
it
may
well
be
that
something
less
than
the
fullest
and
most
effective
cross-examination
will
suffice
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
confrontation
clause.
but
if
there's
any
evidence
as
to
which
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
the
true
and
full
measure
of
cross-examination.
it
is
the
highly
unreliable
and
powerfully
incriminating
evidence
which
went
before
the
jury
that
convicted
o'neil.
now,
o'neil
did
not
have
a
full
and
effective
opportunity
to
cross-examine
all
the
witnesses
against
him,
for
the
alleged
maker
of
this
devastating
out
of
court
accusation,
flatly
denied
having
made
the
statement.
fully
effective
cross-examination
of
an
out
of
court
accusation
of
this
type,
can
occur
only
when
the
witness
to
whom
the
statement
is
attributed,
affirms
the
statement
in
court,
so
that
the
accused
can
probe
its
truthfulness
by
all
the
many
lines
of
attack
that
we
include
under
the
head
of
cross-examination.
this
principle
is
established
in
the
case
at
bar
as
govern
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
douglas
against
alabama
and
bruton
against
the
united
states.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
if
he
admitted
the
genuineness
of
the
statement.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
but
he
denied
the
truthfulness
of
the
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i'm
just
merely
trying
to
get
clear
on
the
hypothetical
situation.
i
assume
you're
posing
the
case
where
the
witness
admits
making
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
then
there
are
two
further
facts
which
may
change
the
result.
thus,
he
then
say,
?i
deny
now,
what
i
said
then.
what
i
said
was
not
true?
or
does
he
say,
?and
furthermore
what
i
said
was
true.?
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
to
the
extent
that
he
admits
making
the
statement,
but
denies
the
content
of
it.
now,
he
says
it's
genuine
but
that
it
wasn't
true,
then
you
have
the
situation
which
--
a
situation
which
the
united
states
is
amicus
curiae
in
green
said
there
would
be
effective
cross-examination
in
this
case.
the
united
states
in
green
took
the
position
that
where
there
was
a
flat
denial
of
the
statement
as
to
its
genuineness
and
its
truthfulness,
there
can
be
no
effective
cross-examination,
that's
our
case
here.
the
--
a
further
case
is
the
one
where
the
witness
admits
the
genuineness
of
the
statement
but
denies
its
truthfulness.
that
is
somewhat
more
like
that
green
case,
but
still
not
too
green.
the
third
situation
is
the
one
where
the
witness
affirms
making
the
statement,
and
he
affirms
the
truthfulness
of
what's
contained
in
there.
then,
he
essentially
incorporates
and
reproduces
the
accusations
in
court
and
at
that
point,
the
only
--
which
it
again,
not
our
case,
the
only
remaining
argument
against
the
admission
of
the
statement
under
those
circumstances
would
simply
be
a
straight
due
process
argument
that
despite
this
fact,
the
evidence
is
still
so
unreliable
that
the
traditional
exclusion
of
evidence
of
this
sort
is
required
as
a
constitutional
matter.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
the
purposes
of
cross
--
i
would
hesitate
mr.
chief
justice
to
try
to
encapsulate
here
for
you
all
the
purposes
of
cross-examination
as
this
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes,
these
are
certainly
among
the
purposes,
one
is
to
attack
the
credibility
of
the
witness
through
the
various
devices
which
are
encompassed
under
the
head
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
he
would
probably
not
cross-examine
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes,
he
did
not,
o'neil's
counsel
did
not
cross-examine
runnels.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
think
he
made
that
decision
because
he
realized
he
could
not
fully
effectively
cross-examine
the
really
damaging
evidence
in
this
case
by
addressing
questions
to
runnels.
the
most
that
he
could
hope
to
do
would
be
to
elicit
from
runnels
a
cumulative
repetition
of
the
denial
of
the
statement
which
runnels
had
already
made
on
examination
by
his
own
counsel.
the
notion
that
this
denial
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
this
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes.
there
was
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
officer.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
was
not
questioned.
he
was
not
cross-examined
by
o'neil's
counsel.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
i
do
not.
i
simply
say
that
that
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
officer
and
the
opportunity
to
address
further
questions
to
runnels
denying
the
statement,
do
not
amount
to
a
full
and
effective
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
most
damaging
evidence
in
this
case.
this
out
of
court
accusation
is
particularly
incriminating
and
particularly
unreliable
kind
of
evidence.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
this
witness,
runnels,
stated
that
he
never
made
such
a
statement.
he
denied
having
made
the
statement.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
could
not
be
effectively
cross-examined
on
this
statement
that
was
attributed
to
him
by
another.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
there
are
some
lines
of
questioning
which
could
be
addressed
to
the
officer
and
there
were
some
lines
of
questioning
which
were
addressed
to
the
officer
by
runnels'
counsel
and
that
is
no
substitute.
that
is
no
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct.
but
surely,
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
because
he
did
not
feel
that
he
had
anything
to
gain
by
attempting
to
question
that
officer.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
but
if
that
had
been
the
case,
if
that
had
been
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
i'm
not
complaining
about
that.
but
if
that
had
been
sufficient
cross-examination
of
this
out
of
court
accusation,
both
bruton
and
douglas
would
have
had
to
been
decided
otherwise.
in
douglas,
there
were
law
officers
on
the
stand
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
in
the
context
this
trial,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right.
he
did
not
exercise
his
opportunity
to
address
questions
to
either
of
those
witnesses.
the
point
is
that
that
opportunity
which
he
had,
which
he
admittedly
had
is
not
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
his
accusers
on
the
accusations
made
to
them.
it's
not
a
fully
effective
opportunity
to
do
that.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
can
accurately
cross-examine
his
accusers
if
his
accusers
come
in
to
open
court
and
give
their
accusations
in
open
court,
either
directly
at
that
point
or
by
affirming
the
accusation
and
incorporating
it
in
their
testimony,
pledging
their
credibility
to
witness
standing
behind
it
in
the
court.
that
is
--
that
is
confrontation
and
that
is
cross-examination.
and
i
urge
again,
that
this
requirement
of
full
and
effective
cross-examination
is
one
that
is
appropriate
to
evidence
of
this
kind.
and
if
i
may
return
for
just
a
moment
to
the
nature
of
this
evidence,
in
the
recent
case
here
of
dutton
against
evans,
the
plurality
opinion
was
able
to
identify
a
number
of
indicia
of
reliability
which
attached
to
the
spontaneous
remark
that
was
there
held
to
be
properly
admitted,
despite
the
fact
that
the
person
who
made
it
was
not
called
as
a
witness
at
all.
in
this
case
by
contrast,
one
can
identify
numerous
indicia
of
unreliability
that
attached
to
this
statement.
this
is
accomplice
testimony.
the
accomplice
was
under
arrest.
he
was
facing
prosecution.
he
made
a
self-serving.
he
allegedly
made
a
self-serving,
plain-shifting
statement.
he
was
in
the
coercive
atmosphere
of
custody.
he
--
they
--
a
common
interrogation
strategy
was
used
against
him,
giving
him
a
motive
to
accuse
his
fellow.
the
statement
was
reported
in
the
court
by
an
interested
party,
namely
the
investigating
officer
who
allegedly
received
the
statement.
there
was
no
other
officer
present.
there
was
no
other
person
present,
and
the
statement,
the
statement
is
oral
and
unrecorded.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
am
here
pointing
out
the
indicia
of
unreliability
that
is
attached
to
the
evidence
which
was
the
decisive
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
and
this
evidence
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
this
is
the
officer's
evidence
of
a
statement
attributed
to
runnels.
it
is
his
evidence
of
a
statement
by
runnels.
that
evidence,
that
evidence
has
this
indicia
of
unreliability
attached
to
it.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
yes.
i'm
saying
the
evidence
which
were
complaining
about
here
is
this
evidence
of
the
statement
which
is
the
officer's
evidence.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
and
to
the
extent
that
he
is
not
reporting
statements
of
this
kind,
then
he
can
be
cross-examined.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
think
it
has
a
close
affinity
to
due
process
arguments.
however,
i
do
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
i
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
only
in
the
sense
that
they
were
physically
present
in
the
court.
there
was
not
confrontation
in
the
sense
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
he
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no,
he
could
have.
he
couldn't
had
and
effective
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
accusation
against
him.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
if
the
statement
had
originally
been
given
at
a
time
when
it
was
subject
to
full
and
effective
cross-examination
as
the
statements
were
in
green
that
would
have
sufficed.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
the
statement
the
officer
waived
that
the
court
didn't
reached
that
statement.
the
statement
that
the
court
held,
could
have
been
improperly
admitted
at
the
trial.
it
was
the
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
green
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
green
--
in
green,
the
witness
conceded
giving
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
he
further
insisted
in
court
that
the
testimony
that
he
gave
was
the
truth,
as
he
then
believed
it.
and
he
further
insisted
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
he
couldn't
--
he
was
now
telling
the
truth
when
he
said
he
really
couldn't
remember
what
happened.
but
green
is
a
case
that
is
quite
different
from
this.
this
is
a
flat
denial
that
any
statement
was
made,
it's
genuineness
as
to
(inaudible)
than
its
truthfulness
is
denied.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
my
position
on
that
would
be
that
it
is
not
this
case,
there
is
a
further
opportunity.
we
come
closer
to
full
and
effective
cross-examination
in
that
case.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
i
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
under
confrontation,
given
this
kind
of
statement.
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
that
cannot
come
in
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
because
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right
and
if
we're
talking
about
this
kind
of
statement.
if
we're
talking
about
oral
unrecorded
statements
given
in
custody,
reported
to
police
officers
by
accomplices
with
the
motive
to
incriminate
others
that
we
have
here,
but
it
is
this
kind
of
evidence,
i
would
take
that
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
but
green
was
--
green
involved
--
if
green
would
have
to
--
some
of
the
discussion
in
green
would
have
to
more
close
limited
to
the
facts
if
the
position
that
i've
just
urged
were
to
be
held
to
be
still
open,
that's
correct.
however,
there
was
in
that
case
a
very
different
kind
of
statement.
it
was
in
principally
involved.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
this
gets
very
precisely
to
the
point
that
was
urged
by
petitioner
here
that
his
denial
is
that
best
thing
that
can
hoped
for
on
cross-examination.
that
is
simply
isn't
true.
runnels,
for
example
in
this
case,
runnels
self
interested
denial
that
he
made
the
statement,
whether
it's
true,
either
way,
is
far
less
persuasive
to
the
jury
than
many
of
the
results
that
cross-examination
might
have
achieved.
for
example,
by
showing
that
the
statement
was
motivated
by
anger
that
it
was
full
of
errors
and
inconsistencies,
runnels
denial
really
carries
no
more
weight
in
the
jury's
eyes
than
he
is
not
guilty
plea.
he
has
to
deny
the
statement
and
the
denial
is
no
substitute
for
cross-examination.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
you
certainly
do.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
you
certainly
do.
you
hope
that
it
will,
but
that
does
not
substitute
for
cross-examination.
it
does
not
substitute
for
what
you
can
get
in
terms
of
an
effective
probing
of
an
accusation
that's
made
in
court
by
an
accuser
who
is
there
in
court.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
if
one
where
to
have
an
accuser
in
court
and
to
subject
him
to
a
probing
cross-examination
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
according
to
the
police
officer,
he
is.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
is
not
an
accuser
then.
he
is
one
of
the
defendants.
he
is
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
stands
--
he
stands
at
that
point
in
the
dock,
accused
side
by
side
with
the
defendant,
and
he
can't
--
if
the
accuser
can't
be
cross-examine
by
addressing
questions
to
runnels.
finally
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
correct.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
pardon?
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
have
the
rationale
of
douglas
against
alabama
and
bruton
against
the
united
states.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
the
holding,
the
holding.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
no.
i
want
to
bring
this
case
back
to
the
kind
of
statement
and
the
kind
of
evidence
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
talking
about
a
classical
form
of
unreliable,
devastating
accusation.
that's
the
kind
of
evidence
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
you
can
get
the
probing
if
the
witness
who
makes
the
accusation
testifies
--
mr.
james
s.
campbell
he
can't.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
that's
right.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
they
should
--
that's
right.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
well,
if
i
may,
the
procedure
that
should
be
followed
in
cases
like
this
is
the
procedure
that
mr.
justice
white
outlined
in
his
dissent
in
bruton
and
the
one
that
the
american
bar
association
project
and
(inaudible)
the
standards
for
criminal
justice
has
recommended.
mr.
james
s.
campbell
i
think
that
the
discussion
indicates
there's
a
--
is
a
constitutional
problem.
