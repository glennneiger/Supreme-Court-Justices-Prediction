mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
bruton
there.
was
the
respondent
o'neil,
given
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
a
co-defendant
runnels,
who
in
a
confession
implicated
o'neil
or
to
perhaps
phrase
it
as
the
court
of
appeal
did,
was
there
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross-examination.
i
think
a
central
to
the
determination
of
this
question
is
examination
of
the
purpose
of
confrontation,
and
is
this
court
recently
said
in
dutton
v.
evans
and
i
quote,
?the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
the
mission
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
to
advance
a
practical
concern
for
the
accuracy
of
the
truth
determining
process
in
criminal
trials
by
assuring
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
a
satisfactory
basis
for
evaluating
the
truth
of
the
prior
statement.?
now
before
looking
to
the
options
available,
when
the
confessing
co-defendant
takes
that
stand
as
mr.
runnels
did
in
this
case,
let's
see
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
pointer
type
issue
where
the
witness
never
takes
a
stand
and
is
never
cross-examined,
never
available.
this
is
not
a
douglas
type
issue
where
the
co-defendant
takes
the
stand,
but
by
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
removes
himself
from
any
possibility
of
either
direct
or
cross-examination.
so,
when
the
court
of
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
mr.
runnels?
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
no,
your
honor.
he
voluntarily
testified.
he
was
on
the
stand
at
his
own
request
in
his
own
defense.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
that
is
my
viewpoint,
your
honor.
he
had
the
full
opportunity,
he
could
have
done
so
if
he
wanted,
but
he
did
not.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
yes,
they
were
indeed
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
well,
this
is
part
of
my
point.
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
well,
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
that's
part
of
the
issue
here.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
you
certainly
can.
this
was
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
is
what
--
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
precisely
what
happened
when
the
state
prosecutor
cross-examined
mr.
runnels.
he
went
back
and
said,
?well,
didn't
you
talk
to
officer
traphagen??
and
mr.
runnels
says,
sure,
i
did.
didn't
officer
traphagen
asked
you
a
few
did
this
and
so?
sure,
he
did
and,
didn't
you
say
you
did?
no,
i
didn't.
i
never
--
i
--
once
i
found
out
that
i
had
a
right
to
attorney,
i
calmed
up
and
didn't
say
anything
further.
and
the
--
then
the
prosecutor
said,
well,
didn't
you
really
do
this,
didn't
you
really
commit
this
crime
and
he
said,
no
i
didn't
do
any
such
thing.
this
was
--
these
options
where
all
available
to
mr.
o'neil's
counsel.
he
complains
that
perhaps,
he
couldn't
bring
out
the
fact
or
that
he
couldn't
bring
up
the
fact
that
maybe
o'neil
was
have
some
kind
of
motive,
have
some
kind
of
dislike
for
--
maybe
runnels
have
some
kind
of
dislike
for
o'neil
because
o'neil
had
sort
of
told
on
him
as
officer
traphagen
had
told
mr.
runnels.
but,
he
could
have
asked
runnels
that
he
could
have
said
do
you
dislike
o'neil?
runnels
would
have
said,
?no.?
would
your
dislike
for
o'neil
could
have
caused
you
to
make
this
statement?
i
didn't
make
any
statement
at
all.
i
like
o'neil,
we
didn't
do
it.
this
was
available,
but
it
wasn't
done.
now,
so
i
think,
i
think
that
that
you've
really
pointed
out,
perhaps
the
ultimate
question,
the
better
question
here.
why
should
o'neil
attack
the
statement
at
all?
cross-examination
is
a
tool,
but
you
don't
use
tools
unwisely.
you
don't
use
tools
if
you
don't
need
to
and
they
didn't
need
to.
now,
i,
myself
have
wondered
how
the
court
of
appeals
could
say
there
wasn't
any
effective
cross-examination
in
this
case
or
wasn't
any
possibility?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
and
mr.
o'neil
has
proffered
a
few
explanations
in
his
brief
before
this
court,
and
we
touched
on
some
of
them
with
my
answers.
namely,
he
says
that,
?you
can
only
have
effective
cross-examination
if
the
witness
--
if
you
can
bring
out
qualifications
in
his
testimony
of
other
things.?
again,
this
is
confusing
the
technique
with
the
purpose
of
cross-examination.
i
mentioned
again,
that
there's
not
point
to
probe
runnels'
anger.
he
could
have
asked
runnels
if
he
was
angry
at
him,
but
he
didn't.
he
says
you
can't
probe
the
statement
for
omissions
or
errors
or
inconsistencies.
well,
you
don't
want
to.
this
statement
--
this
statement,
what
more
could
he
want?
then
what
runnels
--
then
what
runnels
gave
him
on
the
stand.
as
the
dissenting
judge
below
pointed
out,
?the
best
o'neil
could
hope
for
would
be
for
runnels
to
testify
that
the
confession
was
false
and
that
o'neil
did
not
commit
the
crimes.?
here,
runnels
gave
o'neil
all
that
and
more.
he
denied
that
he
confessed
and
said
at
o'neil
was
not
at
the
scene
of
the
crimes.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
he
did
admit
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
yes,
he
did
mr.
justice
white.
and
not
only
that,
but
he
said
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
was
available
for
expiration.
in
fact,
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
was
brought
out
in
the
closing
arguments.
i
remember
they
brought
in
one
witness
who
said,
?well,
i
talked
to
officer
traphagen
and
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
give
runnels
five
to
10
years,
if
the
told
me
something
and
one
year
to
life
if
he
didn't,
so
i
told
runnels
and
then
runnels
confessed.
this
kind
of
thing
was
all
available
for
expiration,
but
it
wasn't
done.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
they
didn't.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
you
mean,
where
he
admits
having
made
the
statement?
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
oh!
this
is
what
he
did
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
is
on
the
defendant
on
--
he
was
appearing
as
his
own
witness
and
at
the
same
time
as
a
witness
for
mr.
o'neil.
it
makes
no
difference
as
far
as
i
can
see,
who
calls
him
with
this
particular
--
this
is
the
result
of
his
testimony.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
well,
it
depends
insofar
as
who
is
cross
examining
him,
that's
indeed
true.
in
fact,
although
here,
the
cross-examination
came
by
his
co-defendant
who
was
being
tried
at
same
time,
so
he
still
have
cross
examination
by
a
defendant
as
opposed
to
cross
examination
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
i
don't
think
so.
there
are
certainly
alternatives.
i
mean,
he
could
have
said
well,
i
said
that
but
i
was
beaten.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
because
he
had
the
perfect,
the
most
favorable
result
from
his
direct
examination
came
out.
i
didn't
say
it
and
we
weren't
there.
this
was
the
ultimate
kind
of
response
you
can
get
from
a
witness
as
to
these
particular
facts.
this
is
exactly
what
o'neil
got.
there
was
no
reason
to
cross-examine
him.
now
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
was
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
yes,
there
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
he
did
take
the
stand.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
on
the
merits,
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
today,
it
would
not
be.
i
think
either
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
green,
suggesting
that
this
is
available,
a
substantive
of
evidence,
certainly
under
california
law
or
in
harris
v.
new
york
where
it
could
be
used
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
impeachment
to
--
against
mr.
runnels
testifying
in
behalf
of
o'neil.
this
certainly
militates
against
any
claim
of
harm
which
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
you
would
even
reach.
i
don't
have
a
great
deal
to
add,
but
i
would
like
to
briefly
touch
upon
the
last
argument
which
the
respondent
has
categorized
as
a
pro
forma
argument.
this
is
in
relation
to
the
concept
of
exhaustion.
perhaps,
it's
a
pro
forma
to
respond
and
it
certainly
is
not
pro
forma
to
us
as
a
state.
it's
a
rather
short
argument
because
there
is
not
really
much
to
say.
when
--
the
point
is
this.
when
new
principles
are
announced
by
this
court,
some
court
must
examine,
when
it's
a
retroactive
principle,
it
must
examine
all
cases.
this
is
a
new
remedy,
bruton,
was
a
new
remedy
under
roberts.
it
was
a
new
decision.
it
was
a
remedy
presently
available,
and
in
the
interest
of
comity
which
this
court
has
just
recently
emphasized
in
harris
v.
younger
and
boyle
v.
landry
and
other
cases,
in
the
interest
of
comity
and
in
the
interest
of
preserving
the
dual
nature
of
federalism,
it
would
seemed
that
it
would
be
better
to
refer
cases
such
as
this
back
to
the
state
court
for
an
initial
look.
the
point
is
this.
now,
i
agree
that
you
could
argue
that
well,
you
already
in
federal
court,
why
go
back
to
the
state
court?
that's
not
really
a
question.
here
the
trial
transcript
had
not
even
been
submitted
to
the
federal
court
at
the
time
we
argued
exhaustion.
some
court
must
examine
this
transcript.
this
one
is
i
would
say
relatively
short
by
some
standards
of
trials
in
our
state.
but
i
think
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
further
the
concept
of
federalism
and
certainly
reduce
the
burden
on
the
federal
judiciary,
if
exhaustion
were
utilized,
when
a
new
decision
creates.
it
--
what
is
in
effect
a
new
remedy
and
makes
it
presently
available.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
should
have
done
with
this
case,
and
the
--
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
from
the
court,
i'll
submit.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
just
a
very
few
brief
comment
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
i
would
like
to
bring
out
something
i
believe
is
a
misunderstanding
of
the
record
on
the
part
of
mr.
campbell.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
bruton
there.
was
the
respondent
o'neil,
given
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
a
co-defendant
runnels,
who
in
a
confession
implicated
o'neil
or
to
perhaps
phrase
it
as
the
court
of
appeal
did,
was
there
an
opportunity
for
effective
cross-examination.
i
think
a
central
to
the
determination
of
this
question
is
examination
of
the
purpose
of
confrontation,
and
is
this
court
recently
said
in
dutton
v.
evans
and
i
quote,
?the
decisions
of
this

make
it
clear
that
the

by
assuring
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
a
satisfactory
basis
for
evaluating
the
truth
of
the
prior
statement.?
now
before
looking
to
the
options
available,
when
the
confessing
co-defendant
takes
that
stand
as
mr.
runnels
did
in
this
case,
let's
see
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
pointer
type
issue
where
the
witness
never
takes
a
stand
and
is
never
cross-examined,
never
available.
this
is
not
a
douglas
type
issue
where
the
co-defendant
takes
the
stand,
but
by
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
removes
himself
from
any
possibility
of
either
direct
or
cross-examination.
so,
when
the
court
of
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
mr.
runnels?
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
no,
your
honor.
he
voluntarily
testified.
he
was
on
the
stand
at
his
own
request
in
his
own
defense.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
that
is
my
viewpoint,
your
honor.
he
had
the
full
opportunity,
he
could
have
done
so
if
he
wanted,
but
he
did
not.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
yes,
they
were
indeed
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
well,
this
is
part
of
my
point.
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
well,
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
that's
part
of
the
issue
here.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
you
certainly
can.
this
was
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
is
what
--
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
precisely
what
happened
when
the
state
prosecutor
cross-examined
mr.
runnels.
he
went
back
and
said,
?well,
didn't
you
talk
to
officer
traphagen??
and
mr.
runnels
says,
sure,
i
did.
didn't
officer
traphagen
asked
you
a
few
did
this
and
so?
sure,
he
did
and,
didn't
you
say
you
did?
no,
i
didn't.
i
never
--
i
--
once
i
found
out
that
i
had
a
right
to
attorney,
i
calmed
up
and
didn't
say
anything
further.
and
the
--
then
the
prosecutor
said,
well,
didn't
you
really
do
this,
didn't
you
really
commit
this
crime
and
he
said,
no
i
didn't
do
any
such
thing.
this
was
--
these
options
where
all
available
to
mr.
o'neil's
counsel.
he
complains
that
perhaps,
he
couldn't
bring
out
the
fact
or
that
he
couldn't
bring
up
the
fact
that
maybe
o'neil
was
have
some
kind
of
motive,
have
some
kind
of
dislike
for
--
maybe
runnels
have
some
kind
of
dislike
for
o'neil
because
o'neil
had
sort
of
told
on
him
as
officer
traphagen
had
told
mr.
runnels.
but,
he
could
have
asked
runnels
that
he
could
have
said
do
you
dislike
o'neil?
runnels
would
have
said,
?no.?
would
your
dislike
for
o'neil
could
have
caused
you
to
make
this
statement?
i
didn't
make
any
statement
at
all.
i
like
o'neil,
we
didn't
do
it.
this
was
available,
but
it
wasn't
done.
now,
so
i
think,
i
think
that
that
you've
really
pointed
out,
perhaps
the
ultimate
question,
the
better
question
here.
why
should
o'neil
attack
the
statement
at
all?
cross-examination
is
a
tool,
but
you
don't
use
tools
unwisely.
you
don't
use
tools
if
you
don't
need
to
and
they
didn't
need
to.
now,
i,
myself
have
wondered
how
the
court
of
appeals
could
say
there
wasn't
any
effective
cross-examination
in
this
case
or
wasn't
any
possibility?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
and
mr.
o'neil
has
proffered
a

and
we

?you

only
have
effective
cross-examination

if
you

other
things.?
again,
this
is
confusing
the
technique
with
the
purpose
of
cross-examination.
i
mentioned
again,
that
there's
not
point
to
probe
runnels'
anger.
he
could
have
asked
runnels
if
he
was
angry
at
him,
but
he
didn't.
he
says
you
can't
probe
the
statement
for
omissions
or
errors
or
inconsistencies.
well,
you
don't
want
to.
this
statement
--
this
statement,
what
more
could
he
want?
then
what
runnels
--
then
what
runnels
gave
him
on
the
stand.
as
the
dissenting
judge
below
pointed
out,
?the
best
o'neil
could
hope
for
would
be
for
runnels
to
testify
that
the
confession
was
false
and
that
o'neil
did
not
commit
the
crimes.?
here,
runnels
gave
o'neil
all
that
and
more.
he
denied
that
he
confessed
and
said
at
o'neil
was
not
at
the
scene
of
the
crimes.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
he
did
admit
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
yes,
he
did
mr.
justice
white.
and
not
only
that,
but
he
said
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
was
available
for
expiration.
in
fact,
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
was
brought
out
in
the
closing
arguments.
i
remember
they
brought
in
one
witness
who
said,
?well,
i
talked
to
officer
traphagen
and
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
give
runnels
five
to
10
years,
if
the
told
me
something
and
one
year
to
life
if
he
didn't,
so
i
told
runnels
and
then
runnels
confessed.
this
kind
of
thing
was
all
available
for
expiration,
but
it
wasn't
done.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
they
didn't.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
you
mean,
where
he
admits
having
made
the
statement?
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
oh!
this
is
what
he
did
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
is
on
the
defendant
on
--
he
was
appearing
as
his
own
witness
and
at
the
same
time
as
a
witness
for
mr.
o'neil.
it
makes
no
difference
as
far
as
i
can
see,
who
calls
him
with
this
particular
--
this
is
the
result
of
his
testimony.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
well,
it
depends
insofar
as
who
is
cross
examining
him,
that's
indeed
true.
in
fact,
although
here,
the
cross-examination
came
by
his
co-defendant
who
was
being
tried
at
same
time,
so
he
still
have
cross
examination
by
a
defendant
as
opposed
to
cross
examination
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
i
don't
think
so.
there
are
certainly
alternatives.
i
mean,
he
could
have
said
well,
i
said
that
but
i
was
beaten.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
because
he
had
the
perfect,
the
most
favorable
result
from
his
direct
examination
came
out.
i
didn't
say
it
and
we
weren't
there.
this
was
the
ultimate
kind
of
response
you
can
get
from
a
witness
as
to
these
particular
facts.
this
is
exactly
what
o'neil
got.
there
was
no
reason
to
cross-examine
him.
now
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
this
was
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
yes,
there
--
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
he
did
take
the
stand.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
on
the
merits,
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
today,
it
would
not
be.
i
think
either
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
green,
suggesting
that
this
is
available,
a
substantive
of
evidence,
certainly
under
california
law
or
in
harris
v.
new
york
where
it
could
be
used
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
impeachment
to
--
against
mr.
runnels
testifying
in
behalf
of
o'neil.
this
certainly
militates
against
any
claim
of
harm
which
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
you
would
even
reach.
i
don't
have
a
great
deal
to
add,
but
i
would
like
to
briefly
touch
upon
the
last
argument
which
the
respondent
has
categorized
as
a
pro
forma
argument.
this
is
in
relation
to
the
concept
of
exhaustion.
perhaps,
it's
a
pro
forma
to
respond
and
it
certainly
is
not
pro
forma
to
us
as
a
state.
it's
a
rather
short
argument
because
there
is
not
really
much
to
say.
when
--
the
point
is
this.
when
new
principles
are
announced
by
this
court,
some
court
must
examine,
when
it's
a
retroactive
principle,
it
must
examine
all
cases.
this
is
a
new
remedy,
bruton,
was
a
new
remedy
under
roberts.
it
was
a
new
decision.
it
was
a
remedy
presently
available,
and
in
the
interest
of
comity
which
this
court
has
just
recently
emphasized
in
harris
v.
younger
and
boyle
v.
landry
and
other
cases,
in
the
interest
of
comity
and
in
the
interest
of
preserving
the
dual
nature
of
federalism,
it
would
seemed
that
it
would
be
better
to
refer
cases
such
as
this
back
to
the
state
court
for
an
initial
look.
the
point
is
this.
now,
i
agree
that
you
could
argue
that
well,
you
already
in
federal
court,
why
go
back
to
the
state
court?
that's
not
really
a
question.
here
the
trial
transcript
had
not
even
been
submitted
to
the
federal
court
at
the
time
we
argued
exhaustion.
some
court
must
examine
this
transcript.
this
one
is
i
would
say
relatively
short
by
some
standards
of
trials
in
our
state.
but
i
think
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
further
the
concept
of
federalism
and
certainly
reduce
the
burden
on
the
federal
judiciary,
if
exhaustion
were
utilized,
when
a
new
decision
creates.
it
--
what
is
in
effect
a
new
remedy
and
makes
it
presently
available.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
should
have
done
with
this
case,
and
the
--
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
from
the
court,
i'll
submit.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
just
a
very
few
brief
comment
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
r.
b.
kirk
i
would
like
to
bring
out
something
i
believe
is
a
misunderstanding
of
the
record
on
the
part
of
mr.
campbell.
