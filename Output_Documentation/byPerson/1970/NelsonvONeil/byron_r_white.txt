justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
get
him
to
tell
the
story
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
having
the
story
in
your
paper
again?
it
may
--
you
may
call
it
a
cross-examination,
but
you
still
get
to
tell
precisely
the
same
story,
you
get
--
no
i
didn't
make
the
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
runnels
did
admit,
having
a
conversation
with
the
detective?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
didn't
--
and
just
said
he
just
disagreed
is
what
the
content
was
of
the
conversation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
circumstances
of
the
conversation
were
available
for
investigation.
i
mean,
under
what
circumstances
did
you
have
this
conversation.
was
there
any
violence
or
threats,
or
promises
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
ask
you
--
this
was
pre-bruton
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
this
co-defendant
had
never
taken
the
stand,
there
would
have
been
a
bruton
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
did
take
the
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
--
there
was
availability
to
cross-examination.
if
the
trial
were
held
today,
i
suppose
the
prosecution
after
runnels
had
taken
the
stand,
he
is
available
for
cross-examination
could
--
well,
the
evidence
was
inadmissible
then
admissible
against
the
defendant,
wasn't
it
on
the
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
limiting
instruction
was
no
longer
necessary?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
green
hold
that
a
prior
statement
is
admitted
and
the
witness
testifies,
and
he's
making
the
statement
but
denied
the
truth
of
the
statement,
gives
a
different
version
in
the
court
the
he
gave
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
dispose
of
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly
aside
from
green,
let's
take
the
situation
where
the
witness
does
say
yes,
i
made
the
statement
but
i
deny
that
it
was
true.
and
i
now
give
a
different
version
of
the
events.
would
your
argument
then
say
--
would
your
position
then
be
that
the
prior
statement
is
inadmissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
be
your
position
on
this
mr.
campbell?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
confrontation?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
--
justice
byron
r.
white
whereas
he
says
i
made
the
statement
but
then
i
deny
its
truth?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
green
at
least,
you
call
it
victim,
if
you
want
to
settle
that
kind
of
a
case
i
just
gave
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
confrontation,
what
real
difference
do
you
see
between
the
case
i
just
gave
you
where
he
admits
making
statement,
but
now
denies
its
truth
and
where
he
denies
having
made
the
statement
at
all?
when
you
--
now
on
cross-examination
you
can
ask
him
whether
the
facts
that
the
officer
claims
he
related
are
true
or
not.
i
mean,
you
can
not
only
ask
him
whether
he
made
those
statements,
but
you
can
say
are
those
facts
true,
which
is
precisely
what
you
would
ask
if
he
admitted
making
the
proper
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
certainly
want
the
jury
to
believe
but
he
now
says,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.

well,
i
suppose
get
him
