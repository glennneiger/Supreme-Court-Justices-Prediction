--
next
in
number
336,
nelson
against
o'neil.
mr.
kirk
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
respondent's
counsel
simply
passed
up
his
opportunity
to
cross-examine
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
question
mr.
kirk.
suppose
the
state
have
not
call
runnels
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
get
the
setting
now
of
the
cross-examination.
suppose
the
state
had
called
him,
excuse
me,
suppose
the
state
had
called
him
and
he
simply
relayed
that
he
had
conversations,
but
denied
the
content
as
it
was.
what
would
the
situation
be
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
admits
having
had
a
conversation
with
the
policeman
but
denies
the
policeman's
version
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
who's
call?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
makes
the
difference
in
terms
of
the
sequence
of
his
testimony,
and
whether
he
is
being
cross-examined
or
not,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
defendant
himself
had
called
him,
could
he
have
said
any
--
could
he
have
given
any
testimony
more
favorable
to
the
respondent
here
than
he
gave
as
it
appears
in
this
record
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
as
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
that
there
was
no
occasion
to
cross-examine
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
suggesting
that's
what
the
district
judge,
federal
district
judge
should
have
done
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
kirk.
mr.
campbell?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
have
that
clear.
which
is
the
unreliable
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
you're
going
to
develop
for
us,
why
that's
unreliable
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
ordinarily,
the
purpose
of
cross-examination
is
to
persuade
the
jury
either
one
that
the
witness
is
not
telling
the
truth
or
two
that
his
memory
is
faulty
or
that
for
some
other
reason
his
testimony
should
not
be
accepted?
does
that
generally
represent
cross-examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
those
three
of
the
purposes
that
ordinarily
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
a
witness
is
called,
gives
direct
examination
which
just
has
no
real
impact
on
any
on
the
particular
case
at
all,
just
not
a
bit
harmful.
it
doesn't
help;
it
doesn't
hurt
just
largely
irrelevant.
does
a
wise
lawyer
usually
not
elect
simply
to
let
that
witness
alone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
defendant's
counsel
here,
respondent's
counsel
at
trial
made
that
kind
of
a
decision,
a
tactical
decision
here,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
why
would
you
think
he
made
that
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
was
runnels'
testimony
damaging?
the
denial
which
runnels
offered
in
court
was
of
sum,
but
very,
very
limited
assistance
to
the
defense,
it
was
unnecessary
part
of
the
defense.
obviously,
the
co-defendant
runnels
would
had
to
deny
making
a
statement
if
is
not
going
to
plead
not
guilty,
a
statement
which
incriminates
him
as
well
as
his
co-defendant,
but
the
point
--
the
evidence
that
were
concerned
about,
the
evidence
--
the
accusation
which
has
not
been
cross-examined
and
which
can't
be
cross-examined
by
addressing
question
to
runnels
is
this
out
of
court
in
custody
accusation
that
is
reported,
this
alleged
accusation,
it's
reported
in
court
through
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
a
proper
way
to
attack
to
that
by
cross
examining
the
officer
when
he
testifies
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
--
was
it
permitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
he
cross-examined?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say,
that
was
a
denial
of
cross-examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
are
now
attacking
the
officer's
testimony
or
runnels
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
runnels
or
the
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
now
arguing
that
the
officer's
testimony
should
not
be
--
should
not
have
been
admitted
at
all,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don't
argue
that
he
--
there
was
any
denial
of
opportunity
to
cross-examine
that
officer
as
effectively
and
as
long
as
he
wanted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
could
you
be
any
better
off
than
the
you
were
here,
how
could
you
be
any
better
off?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
runnels
an
accuser?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
when
he
is
sitting
on
the
stand
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
what
are
we
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
american
bar
report
say
that
was
a
constitutional
requirement
or
merely
a
good
idea
to
how
to
handle
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
campbell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
few
minutes

chief
