mr.
campbell,
you
emphasize
this
particularly
unreliable
and
i
have
difficulty
putting
that
together
with
the
fact
that
you
didn't
cross-examine
the
person
who
i
think
your
charging
with
giving
an
unreliable
report.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
you
probe
the
officer
as
to
whether
he
did
or
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
is
not
here.
o'neil
is
here,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
o'neil
asked
the
officer,
for
example,
did
he
make
the
statement,
he
didn't
ask
him
any
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
was
his
tactical,
refusal
to
exercise
his
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
complaining
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'll
be
(inaudible)
this
man
had
the
chance
to
cross-examine,
the
two
people
involved
in
this
(inaudible),
only
two,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
man
is
allegedly
made
a
statement
and
the
officer
who
heard
the
statement.
two
people
are
the
only
two
people,
they
could
get
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
correct
statement
or
not,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right
and
he
didn't
cross-examine
either
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
he
accurately
cross-examine
his
accusers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
saying
that
if
the
man
denies
the
statement,
it's
inadmissible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
rationale?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
heard
my
question
correctly
that
any
statement
if
the
man
denies,
it
can't
be
admitted.
you
don't
want
to
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
stage
of
this
case,
how
could
you
get
a
probing,
to
use
your
word
that
you
wanted,
how
under
the
sun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
--
in
the
case
this,
the
witness
is
made
the
accusation,
the
testimony
is
in.
now
once
that's
there,
how
could
o'neil
probe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
really
saying
the
statement
should
not
have
been
admitted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
here's
the
truth
in
the
case,
once
he
has
said
that,
i
didn't
make
that
statement,
the
state
had
nothing
that
it
could
do
about
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
something
with
his
right
up,
cross-examination
and
confrontation.
