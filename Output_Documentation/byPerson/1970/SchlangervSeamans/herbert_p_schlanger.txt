mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
you
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
its
affirmance
of
the
district
court
of
arizona’s
dismissal
of
my
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
respondents.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
district
court
lacks
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
lawfulness
of
restraints
exercised
over
a
petitioner
who
is
present
in
its
district
when
the
persons
responsible
for
those
restraints
are
elsewhere.
stated
in
other
words,
can
a
petitioner
be
in
custody
and
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
but
not
be
in
custody
within
the
jurisdiction?
after
18
months
of
litigation,
the
allegations
contained
in
my
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
remain
uncontroverted.
those
are
that
i
enlisted
over
eight
years
ago
in
united
states
air
force
and
in
1965
reenlisted
for
a
period
of
six
years
in
order
to
enter
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program
and
obtain
a
commission.
at
that
time,
i
was
assigned
for
duty
to
arizona
state
university
and
enrolled
there
under
the
aecp.
i
attended
the
university
from
january
1966
until
june
of
1968,
ten
weeks
before
my
scheduled
graduation
at
which
time
i
was
summarily
removed
purportedly
for
having
demonstrated
a
lack
of
officer
potential
by
cutting
some
classes.
but
in
fact,
as
alleged
in
my
petition,
i
was
removed
because
of
my
participation
in
the
formation
and
leadership
of
the
arizona
state
university
civil
rights
board,
a
group
which
sought
to
quiet
and
adjudicate
ethnic
and
racial
grievances
arising
on
campus
by
working
with
the
university
and
city
officials.
the
removal
was
unlawful
both
substantively
and
that
it
violated
first
and
fifth
amendment
rights
and
procedurally
and
then
it
violated
regulations
and
due
process
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment.
while
attempting
to
obtain
a
hearing
or
reinstatement
or
administrative
remedy,
i
was
reassigned
to
moody
air
force
base
in
georgia
and
was
relieved
of
duty
as
an
officer
trainee.
i
was
denied
access
to
the
evidence
that
was
used
against
me.
i
requested
but
was
denied
a
hearing.
i
requested
but
was
denied
a
discharge
first,
by
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
air
force
and
later
by
the
air
force
board
for
correction
of
military
records
and
by
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
dr.
seamans.
during
this
entire
period
of
course,
i
was
performing
my
duties
as
an
enlisted
man
at
moody
air
force
base
and
was
promoted
twice,
first
to
sergeant
then
to
staff
sergeant
both
noncommissioned
officer
ranks.
in
may
of
1969,
i
requested
a
temporary
duty
assignment
to
return
to
arizona
state
university
so
that
i
might
complete
my
degree
requirements
for
bachelors
degree
in
mathematics
in
the
summer
session
since
i
was
only
ten
weeks
away
from
my
degree.
since
i
had
apparently
satisfied
my
superiors
that
i
was
doing
my
job
in
an
outstanding
manner,
i
was
reassigned
to
arizona
state.
the
orders
said
that
i
was
to
be
assigned
for
70
duty
days
and
was
permitted
15
days
leave
in
conjunction
with
that
temporary
duty
assignment.
after
completion
of
my
schooling
in
arizona
while
i
was
still
tempe
pursuant
to
those
orders,
i
filed
the
instant
action
for
habeas
corpus.
it
was
immediately
dismissed
by
the
court
without
issuance
of
the
show
cause
order
and
reconsideration
was
denied.
i
then
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
returned
to
georgia
to
continue
my
duties.
i
requested
expeditious
action
and
in
december
1969
the
court
of
appeals
scheduled
the
argument.
i
argued
the
case
while
on
leave
for
moody
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
issuance
of
a
show
cause
order.
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
district
court
would
not
regain
jurisdiction
prior
to
my
removal
to
georgia,
judge
browning
of
the
ninth
circuit
entered
an
injunction.
the
air
force
immediately
terminated
my
pay
and
allowances
an
act
which
i
consider
unlawful
but
which
is
not
of
issue
at
this
time.
the
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir
it
was.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
your
honor,
the
government’s
brief
makes
this
distinction
between
a
permanent
assignment
and
a
temporary
duty
assignment.
i
was
--
i
felt
that
having
been
issued
the
orders
and
having
left
georgia
under
those
orders,
if
i
went
any
place
except
to
arizona
state
university
to
enroll
in
school
and
attend
classes
and
get
my
degree
that
summer
i
would
have
been
prosecuted
as
being
awol.
there
is
a
difference
in
that
my
permanent
duty
station
in
the
aecp
was
wright-patterson
air
force
base,
ohio
with
duty
that
was
on
a
state
university
and
under
bootstrap,
i
was
paying
my
own
expenses,
my
permanent
duty
station
was
in
georgia
and
i
was
assigned
for
duty
at
arizona
state.
i
think
the
distinction
is
minimal.
certainly,
the
order
has
existed
authorizing
my
travel
to
arizona
and
attendance
of
the
university.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir
but
both
were
voluntary
programs.
i
had
requested
entrance.
i
had
applied
for
entrance
in
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program
because
i
wanted
both
the
degree
and
the
commission.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
it
was
necessitated
because
there
was
no
other
way
for
me
to
get
my
degree
prior
to
my
discharge.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
no
longer.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
that
had
been
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
on
an
issue
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
all
the
remedies
suggested
by
the
government
have
since
been
exhausted
and
i
believe
i
submitted
to
the
clerk
papers
from
the
fifth
circuit
containing
an
order
entering
a
voluntary
dismissal
since
the
question
of
exhaustion
is
moot
now.
furthermore,
if
indeed
this
court
upholds
the
government’s
position
concerning
jurisdiction,
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
district
court
for
georgia
no
longer
have
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
since
i’ve
been
removed
and
reassigned
to
iceland.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
holds
for
my
position
contending
that
the
district
court
for
arizona
does
have
jurisdiction
and
it
should
be
properly
be
remanded
to
arizona
rather
than
georgia
since
that
was
the
first
filed
action
and
that
is
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
the
court
of
appeals
never
reached
the
question
that
the
district
court
reached.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
pointing
out
that
there
were
no
respondents
restraining
me
of
my
liberty
within
the
jurisdiction
within
the
district.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
an
earlier
decision
which
held
that
a
serviceman
on
leave
voluntary
had
a
place
other
than
duty
station
is
not
in
custody
at
that
point.
the
government
now
brings
--
takes
up
this
argument
and
argues
that
custody
--
you
can
be
in
custody
since
i
was
concededly
in
custody
on
the
day
i
filed
and
that
i
can
be
lawfully
in
arizona
which
i
was
on
the
day
that
i
filed
but
that
i
was
not
in
custody
in
arizona
under
the
meaning
of
2241.
it
is
my
conviction,
your
honors,
that
this
makes
an
artificial
distinction
that
i
am
not
attacking
col.
baker
or
dr.
seamans
personally.
what
i
am
attacking
is
the
effects
of
their
authority
which
are
--
manifest
upon
me
wherever
i
am.
in
this
case,
they
were
manifested
upon
me
at
a
place
i
had
been
assigned
for
duty
for
the
three
months
prior
to
my
filing
of
the
action
that
is
in
arizona
at
the
place
which
all
of
the
actions
which
gave
rise
to
the
habeas
corpus
action
occurred
that
is
arizona
state
university.
at
which
all
the
witnesses
for
a
hearing
if
it
should
ever
be
held
are
present
except
those
officers
of
the
air
force
who
might
be
needed
to
be
called
and
at
which
any
evidence
outside
of
that
under
the
control
of
the
respondents
is
that
is
university
records,
professors
records
and
things
like
this.
i
cannot
see
that
there
is
any
bar
in
the
statute
and
indeed
ahrens
v.
clark
which
mr.
douglas
--
in
which
mr.
douglas
wrote
the
opinion
--
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
opinion
in
1948
held
that
it
was
the
presence
of
the
petitioner
which
was
the
threshold
requirement
to
filing
of
the
habeas
corpus
action.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
effects
of
air
force
authority
on
me
in
arizona
that
i
was
contesting.
it
was
obviously
custody
since
i
was
forced
to
return
to
georgia.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
what
happened
was
i
filed
the
action
–
well,
all
of
the
indications
in
the
affidavit
of
lt.
mcdonald
which
appear
in
the
appendix
and
are
referred
to
it
in
the
government’s
brief
were
made
without
any
consultation
with
me
in
terms
of
what
days
i
was
attending
school
and
what
days
were
leave.
they’re
substantially
accurate
but
there
is
a
two
discrepancy.
however,
when
i
filed
the
action
it
was
on
my
next
to
the
last
day
of
leave.
i
immediately
called
my
commander
and
requested
an
extension
of
leave
which
was
verbally
granted.
subsequently,
written
orders
were
entered
issued
confirming
that
verbal
extension
of
the
leave.
there
was
no
question
that
i
was
anywhere
near
being
awol
or
running
a
fine
line.
this
was
all
done
with
the
knowledge
of
my
superiors
in
the
air
force,
my
immediate
superiors.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
i
really
feel
that
should
a
hearing
be
held
any
place
else
in
any
district
except
arizona
and
should
we
ever
have
to
get
to
the
substantive
issues
of
whether
i
was
cutting
classes,
whether
cutting
classes
demonstrates
a
lack
of
officer
potential,
whether
the
proceedings
did
follow
air
force
regs
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
call
these
witnesses,
without
them
i
cannot
prove
my
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
well
sir,
the
way
i
understand
1404
(a)
which
is
what
i
assume
is
being
referred
to
arizona
would
have
to
have
had
jurisdiction
originally.
it
would
have
to
have
been
able
to
have
been
brought
in
arizona
in
order
for
it
to
be
transferred
by
the
georgia
court
to
arizona
and
yet
if
this
court
now
finds
that
arizona
could
not
have
jurisdiction
because
i
was
not
permanently
stationed
there,
then
it
could
not
be
transferred.
the
concern
with
this
kind
of
question
seems
to
me
to
be
more
a
question
of
venue
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
pointed
out
than
really
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
question
but
that
i
was
in
custody
and
within
the
jurisdiction
lawfully
and
a
for
a
purpose
connected
with
my
service
that
district
is
not
incidental
to
either
the
action
or
my
military
duties.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
on
the
air
forces
bookkeeping,
yes
sir.
i
was
transferred
to
iceland
on
the
5th
of
january.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
believe
unfortunately,
your
honor
that
i
could
only
bring
it
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
well,
apparently
your
honor
that
it’s
been
held
by
this
court
never
directly
but
at
least
implicitly
that
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
jurisdiction
over
american
citizens
outside
any
other
district
courts
and
therefore
the
district
of
columbia
would
be
a
proper
district.
i
would
like
to
see,
your
honor
an
eventual
development
of
habeas
corpus
so
that
a
petitioner
could
file
either
in
a
district
in
which
he
is
feeling
the
effects
of
the
custody
or
in
which
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
but
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
that
would
be
the
district
of
columbia.
but
in
civil
litigation
it
appears
that
following
international
shoe.
the
courts
have
developed
a
fairness
doctrine
or
contract
theory
and
where
we
extend
this
right
to
civil
litigants.
i
really
cannot
see
that
it
would
be
of
tremendous
inconvenience
to
any
party
to
extend
it
to
military
petitions
for
habeas
corpus.
here
we
are
relatively
free
to
travel
at
certain
times
when
we
are
off
duty
or
when
we
are
on
leave.
there
are
incidents
which
occur
such
as
my
removal
from
the
program
in
arizona,
which
if
the
military
is
allowed
to
remove
me
at
their
will
or
whim,
thus
depriving
that
court
of
jurisdiction
we
are
sanctioning
what
is
in
essence
forum
shopping
by
the
military.
i
really
do
not
believe
sir
that
it
was
coincidence
that
following
my
removal
for
civil
rights
activities
from
arizona
state
university.
i
was
assigned
to
southern
georgia
with
all
due
respect
to
the
south
sir.
i
feel
that
the
government
felt
that
any
further
proceedings
would
be
looked
upon
more
dimly
in
the
middle
district
for
georgia
than
perhaps
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
judge
wyzanski
from
massachusetts
had
a
case
similar
to
the
one
you
described
where
a
gentleman
from
indiana
came
wandering
in
to
massachusetts
with
nothing
but
a
suitcase
and
a
petition.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
in
mccabe
v.
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
judge
wyzanski
looked
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
and
said,
“you
have
no
contacts
in
this
district.
this
is
the
first
time
you’ve
ever
been
in
massachusetts.
you
have
no
reason
for
filing
it
here.
go
elsewhere.”
i
feel
that
the
district
courts
are
more
than
competent
to
decide
whether
there
is
sufficient
contact
between
the
district
and
the
issues
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
but
that
was
sent
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
would
say
sir
that
broadly
for
those
people
contesting
their
induction
let’s
say
which
i
am
not,
this
is
an
enlistment,
but
their
induction
is
conscientious
objectors
for
instance.
much
of
their
evidence
to
prove
their
claims
might
in
fact
be
whether
a
local
draft
board
is.
if
a
person
is
inducted
in
new
york
city
and
then
sent
to
fort
benning,
georgia
the
army
may
hold
a
hearing
and
it
may
just
be
perfunctory
as
it
happen
in
several
cases.
if
he
is
then
forced
to
bring
the
action
in
georgia,
he
has
the
choice
of
either
expending
huge
sums
to
transport
his
witnesses
down
to
georgia
if
indeed
they
are
willing
to
come
or
not
in
fact
not
being
able
to
demonstrate
that
he
has
a
basis
in
fact
for
his
claim,
which
would
preclude
his
winning
his
action.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
because
that
is
the
district
with
the
most
significant
impact
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
am
searching
for
some
way
to
simply
say
i
would
like
to
be
fair
and
equitable.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
well,
i’ve
been
grappling
with
the
same
question
at
what
point
do
you
say
you
can’t
file.
i
would
say
that
where
the
context
of
the
district
--
within
a
district
are
immaterial
to
the
case
then
it’s
obviously
shouldn’t
be
brought
there.
if
the
contexts
are
crucial
to
the
case
then
that
is
obviously
a
permissible
district
and
as
in
most
of
the
rest
of
the
law
there
is
a
small
gray
area
in
between
which
i
think
should
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
courts
individually,
yes
sir.
your
honor,
i
would,
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions
on
this
issue,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
thank
you
your
honor,
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
in
rebuttal
your
honor.
i
was
not
expecting
an
attack
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
petition
at
this
point.
i
have
been
advised
by
mr.
reynolds
that
that
was
not
going
to
be
a
subjects
of
the
brief
or
argument.
however,
i’ll
get
to
that
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
assistant
solicitor
general,
sir
who
briefed
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
initially
sir,
mr.
griswold
now
hold
claims
that
i
was
not
in
custody
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed
and
i
would
like
to
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
page
12
of
the
government’s
brief
at
which
the
government
asserts
that
under
28
u.s.c
2241
he
as
clearly
“in
custody”
in
the
united
stats
force
at
the
time
he
sought
habeas
corpus
relief.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
that
was
the
initial
part
of
the
argument.
later
in
the
argument
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
did
say
that
in
response
to
a
question
that
he
did
not
think
that
i
was
in
custody
at
the
time
i
filed
the
case.
however,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
that’s
the
time
at
which
i
filed
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
but
i,
the
way
i
understood
the
solicitor
general’s
point
was
that
habeas
corpus
would
not
lie
at
such
a
time
because
of
the
tenuous
nature
of
restraints
at
that
particular
point
in
time
and
the
restraints
were
only
potential
to
be
imposed
when
i
had
to
return
to
georgia
and
yet
in
the
brief
they
can
see
that
it
was
properly
filed
since
i
was
in
custody
under
the
statute.
but
i
think
that
that
really
is
clearly.
i
think
the
more
important
question
is
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
which
at
least
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
little
bit.
it
is
claimed
that
exercise
of
this
court’s
jurisdiction
or
district
court’s
jurisdiction
in
cases
of
this
nature
would
dilute
the
writ
--
would
distort
its
purpose.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
orloff
v.
willoughby
which
the
government
cites
in
support
of
this
position.
the
court
said
that
they
would
not
interfere
in
military
duty
assignments
and
i
concur
wholeheartedly,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
proper
judicial
function
to
determine
what
assignment
a
man
in
the
military
should
be
put
to
work
in.
however
your
honor,
the
air
force
could
you
use
me
as
whatever
they
wanted.
they
could
have
kept
me
as
an
aircraft
instrument
repairman
if
they
had
commissioned
me.
i
might
have
been
the
only
2nd
lieutenant
aircraft
instrument
repairman
in
the
air
force
but
it
would
have
been
lawful.
however,
what
were
discussing
here
is
a
status
difference
between
that
of
an
enlisted
man
and
that
of
a
commissioned
officer
which
i
was
entitled
to
expect
under
the
program
for
which
i
reenlisted.
failing
to
commission
me,
i
submit
entitles
to
a
discharge
just
an
entitled
dr.
nelson
in
nelson
v.
peckham
where
the
fourth
circuit
ordered
him
discharge
because
the
army
refused
to
commission
him.
following
this
court’s
decision
in
orloff,
the
congress
revised
the
doctor’s
draft
act
to
require
commissioning
of
doctors
drafted
under
its
provisions
and
the
army
did
to
dr.
nelson
what
it
did
to
dr.
orloff
and
that
they
just
refused
to
commission
him
and
still
held
him.
he
brought
habeas
corpus
and
he
won.
there
was
another
case
which
i
don’t
have
the
site
off
in
california
citing
nelson
v.
peckham.
it
is
not
unusual
to
--
it
is
not
unusual
to
contest
status
differences.
admittedly,
this
is
the
first
case
i
have
seen
of
an
enlistment
status
question
but
i
don’t
think
as
the
fact
that
i
enlisted
dilutes
my
claim
anymore.
if
the
air
force
did
in
fact
unlawfully
changed
my
status
then
the
contract
is
void
and
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
custody
now
being
exercised
over
me.
your
honors,
i
submit
that
habeas
corpus
is
the
proper
vehicle
to
challenge
a
breach
and
void
enlistment
contract.
going
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
contradiction
in
the
government’s
position.
on
the
one
hand,
they
say
that
the
district
court
for
arizona
lacks
jurisdiction
because
there
is
no
respondent
within
the
district.
on
the
other
hand,
they
maintained
that
the
district
court
in
georgia
retains
jurisdiction
even
though
there
is
no
respondent
within
the
district
now.
colonel
baker,
i
submit
sir,
is
no
longer
a
proper
respondent
since
he
is
no
longer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
controlling
or
having
custody
of
me.
i
was
relieved
from
assignment
to
his
unit.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
even
though
there
remains
no
respondent
in
the
district?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
even
on
the
point
that
that
one
is
still
pending.
let’s
assume
that
argument
for
the
moment.
colonel
baker
has
no
control
over
me,
he
is
now
in
the
same
position
that
colonel
rederick
was
at
the
time
that
i
filed
the
petition.
he’s
an
officer
in
the
united
states
air
force.
he
is
commanding
a
military
unit
at
a
place
which
i
have
been
stationed.
he
has
no
direct
control
over
me.
my
commander
in
iceland,
i
filed
a
motion
with
the
clerk
to
amend
my
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
presumably
for
certiorari
also
to
add
my
commander
in
iceland
as
the
respondent.
he
and
dr.
seamans
have
the
custody
now
but
the
question
comes
down
to
when
we
have
the
nature
of
custody.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir
that
underlies
the
habeas
corpus
petition
that
gave
rise
to
the
action.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
to
raise
my
habeas
corpus
on
sir?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
nothing
at
all,
sir.
basically,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
contract
i
contend
the
contract
was
breached.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
your
honor,
i
would
i
think
if
enlistment
is
anything
but
carte
blanche
to
the
military.
if
promises
to
induce
the
military
--
an
enlistment
into
military
are
to
mean
anything
then
we
have
to
guard
against
are
arbitrary
use
of
power
by
the
military
authorities
should
we
give
them
license
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
i
think
what
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
because
in
my
case
sir
we
have
a
status
difference.
upon
my
reenlistment,
orders
which
designated
me
an
officer
trainee
became
effective
and
the
statute
under
which
the
air
force
institute
of
technology
operates
provides
for
training
--
professional
training
and
education
of
officers.
it
says
nothing
about
enlisted
men.
now
obviously,
something
happened
to
my
status
at
my
reenlistment.
it
was
something
different
from
just
that
of
a
plain
old
ordinary
enlisted
man
who
happens
to
be
a
nice
guy
so
they
decided
to
send
me
to
school.
your
honor,
i
reenlisted
so
that
i
might
make
the
air
force
a
career.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
that
was
a
wholly
discretionary
decision
on
their
part.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
that
was
a
local
decision.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
second
time?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
the
second
time
when
i
was
going
at
my
expense
i
was
allowed
to
complete
my
degree
requirements.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
contract
had
already
been
violated,
sir.
it
had
been
violated
while
i
was
in
school
the
first
time
under
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
because
at
that
point
there
was
an
impediment
to
filing.
i
had
to
at
least
attempt
to
exhaust
my
administrative
remedies
prior
to
filing
and
i
considered
that
my
administrative
remedies
were
exhausted
in
november
of
1968
when
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
air
force
denied
my
discharge
and
request
for
hearing.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
pardon
sir?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
i
have
reenlisted
in
1965.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
and
then
the
alleged
breach
occurred
in
june
of
1968.
my
remedies
from
that
breach
were
not
exhausted
until
after
i
was
removed
from
arizona
and
assigned
to
georgia.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
and
so
what
we
are
faced
with
is
the
question
of
whether
the
military
authorities
can
take
action
which
gives
rise
to
a
claim
for
habeas
corpus
then
remove
the
serviceman
from
that
jurisdiction
prior
to
as
being
able
to
initiate
action
because
of
some
impediments
or
other.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
but
assuming
that
we
did
have
habeas
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
cannot
truly
imagine
sir
any
other
theory
under
which
to
bring
this
case.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
air
force
has
to
make
me
an
officer
certainly
if
they
made
an
officer,
i
would
probably,
it
would
suitable
adjustments
and
payments
and
rank
i
would
probably
be
required
to
drop
the
action
and
serve
out
my
enlistment
because
every
application
i’ve
made
has
been
the
alternative,
either
a
discharge
or
reinstatement
in
commissioning.
however,
we
are
talking
about
a
status
difference
and
if
the
air
force
within
itself
refuses
to
even
grant
me
a
hearing
at
any
time
which
they
have
for
three
years
now
on
my
claims
that
i
was
unfairly
eliminated
from
this
program,
unlawfully
eliminated
and
denied
the
status
of
a
commissioned
officer
for
which
i
had
reenlisted,
i
can
see
no
other
theory
under
which
to
bring
it
than
habeas
corpus
which
challenges
unlawful
restraints
by
governmental
authorities.
your
honor,
if
you
have
no
further
questions--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
at
this
point,
sir
i
would
like
to
be
discharged
from
the
air
force.
i
cannot
see
that
even
if
the
air
force
commissioned
me,
i
could
make
it
a
career
successfully
after
the
publicity
that
has
been
attending
to
the
case
and
very
truthfully
since
my
initiation
of
the
proceedings,
i
discovered
that
i
have
hopefully
some
aptitude
for
the
law
and
would
like
to
make
the
law
a
career.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
sir?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
that
under
law
is
it
that
at
the
moment
that
contract
for
under
which
i
was
reenlisted
is
void.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
entire
contract
since
it
was
a
contract
based
upon
my
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
commission
me,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
government
conceded
in
orloff
v.
willoughby
that
had
he
been
entitled
to
a
commission.
this
would
have
been
a
proper
action
in
habeas
corpus
but
then
they
denied
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
commission
and
the
court
agreed
with
him.
the
facts
in
this
case
since
we
have
no
evidence
on
entitlements
under
the
enlistment
agreement,
since
we’ve
never
been
able
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
remain
from
my
allegations
in
the
petition
that
is
that
i
was
entitled,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
in
this
particular
action?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
in
this
particular
action
to
affect
my
release
from
custody?yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir.
to
affect,
to
force--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
not
any
part.
the
material
central
point
which
goes
to
my
status
on
that
point,
i
think
when
the
air
force
refuses
to
honor
the
central
part
of
the
contract,
i
think
that
yes
sir,
i
am
entitled
to
asked
to
be
discharged.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
of
late
with
the
expenses
[laughter].
but
no
sir
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
i
have
up
until
this
point
i
have
never
asked.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir
and
i
contend
that
the
courts
have
no
power
to
order
my
commissioning.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
you
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
its
affirmance
of
the
district
court
of
arizona’s
dismissal
of
my
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
respondents.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
district
court
lacks
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
lawfulness
of
restraints
exercised
over
a
petitioner
who
is
present
in
its
district
when
the
persons
responsible
for
those
restraints
are
elsewhere.
stated
in
other
words,
can
a
petitioner
be
in
custody
and
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
but
not
be
in
custody
within
the
jurisdiction?
after
18
months
of
litigation,
the
allegations
contained
in
my
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
remain
uncontroverted.
those
are
that
i
enlisted
over
eight
years
ago
in
united
states
air
force
and
in
1965
reenlisted
for
a
period
of
six
years
in
order
to
enter
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program
and
obtain
a
commission.
at
that
time,
i
was
assigned
for
duty
to
arizona
state
university
and
enrolled
there
under
the
aecp.
i
attended
the
university
from
january
1966
until
june
of
1968,
ten
weeks
before
my
scheduled
graduation
at
which
time
i
was
summarily
removed
purportedly
for
having
demonstrated
a
lack
of
officer
potential
by
cutting
some
classes.
but
in
fact,
as
alleged
in
my
petition,
i
was
removed
because
of
my
participation
in
the
formation
and
leadership
of
the
arizona
state
university
civil
rights
board,
a
group
which
sought
to
quiet
and
adjudicate
ethnic
and
racial
grievances
arising
on
campus
by
working
with
the
university
and
city
officials.
the
removal
was
unlawful
both
substantively
and
that
it
violated
first
and
fifth
amendment
rights
and
procedurally
and
then
it
violated
regulations
and
due
process
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment.
while
attempting
to
obtain
a
hearing
or
reinstatement
or
administrative
remedy,
i
was
reassigned
to
moody
air
force
base
in
georgia
and
was
relieved
of
duty
as
an
officer
trainee.
i
was
denied
access
to
the
evidence
that
was
used
against
me.
i
requested
but
was
denied
a
hearing.
i
requested
but
was
denied
a
discharge
first,
by
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
air
force
and
later
by
the
air
force
board
for
correction
of
military
records
and
by
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
dr.
seamans.
during
this
entire
period
of
course,
i
was
performing
my
duties
as
an
enlisted
man
at
moody
air
force
base
and
was
promoted
twice,
first
to
sergeant
then
to
staff
sergeant
both
noncommissioned
officer
ranks.
in
may
of
1969,
i
requested
a
temporary
duty
assignment
to
return
to
arizona
state
university
so
that
i
might
complete
my
degree
requirements
for
bachelors
degree
in
mathematics
in
the
summer
session
since
i
was
only
ten
weeks
away
from
my
degree.
since
i
had
apparently
satisfied
my
superiors
that
i
was
doing
my
job
in
an
outstanding
manner,
i
was
reassigned
to
arizona
state.
the
orders
said
that
i
was
to
be
assigned
for
70
duty
days
and
was
permitted
15
days
leave
in
conjunction
with
that
temporary
duty
assignment.
after
completion
of
my
schooling
in
arizona
while
i
was
still
tempe
pursuant
to
those
orders,
i
filed
the
instant
action
for
habeas
corpus.
it
was
immediately
dismissed
by
the
court
without
issuance
of
the
show
cause
order
and
reconsideration
was
denied.
i
then
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
returned
to
georgia
to
continue
my
duties.
i
requested
expeditious
action
and
in
december
1969
the
court
of
appeals
scheduled
the
argument.
i
argued
the
case
while
on
leave
for
moody
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
issuance
of
a
show
cause
order.
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
district
court
would
not
regain
jurisdiction
prior
to
my
removal
to
georgia,
judge
browning
of
the
ninth
circuit
entered
an
injunction.
the
air
force
immediately
terminated
my
pay
and
allowances
an
act
which
i
consider
unlawful
but
which
is
not
of
issue
at
this
time.
the
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir
it
was.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
your
honor,
the
government’s
brief
makes
this
distinction
between
a
permanent
assignment
and
a
temporary
duty
assignment.
i
was
--
i
felt
that
having
been
issued
the
orders
and
having
left
georgia
under
those
orders,
if
i
went
any
place
except
to
arizona
state
university
to
enroll
in
school
and
attend
classes
and
get
my
degree
that
summer
i
would
have
been
prosecuted
as
being
awol.
there
is
a
difference
in
that
my
permanent
duty
station
in
the
aecp
was
wright-patterson
air
force
base,
ohio
with
duty
that
was
on
a
state
university
and
under
bootstrap,
i
was
paying
my
own
expenses,
my
permanent
duty
station
was
in
georgia
and
i
was
assigned
for
duty
at
arizona
state.
i
think
the
distinction
is
minimal.
certainly,
the
order
has
existed
authorizing
my
travel
to
arizona
and
attendance
of
the
university.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir
but
both
were
voluntary
programs.
i
had
requested
entrance.
i
had
applied
for
entrance
in
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program
because
i
wanted
both
the
degree
and
the
commission.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
it
was
necessitated
because
there
was
no
other
way
for
me
to
get
my
degree
prior
to
my
discharge.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
no
longer.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
that
had
been
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
on
an
issue
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
all
the
remedies
suggested
by
the
government
have
since
been
exhausted
and
i
believe
i
submitted
to
the
clerk
papers
from
the
fifth
circuit
containing
an
order
entering
a
voluntary
dismissal
since
the
question
of
exhaustion
is
moot
now.
furthermore,
if
indeed
this
court
upholds
the
government’s
position
concerning
jurisdiction,
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
district
court
for
georgia
no
longer
have
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
since
i’ve
been
removed
and
reassigned
to
iceland.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
holds
for
my
position
contending
that
the
district
court
for
arizona
does
have
jurisdiction
and
it
should
be
properly
be
remanded
to
arizona
rather
than
georgia
since
that
was
the
first
filed
action
and
that
is
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
the
court
of
appeals
never
reached
the
question
that
the
district
court
reached.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
pointing
out
that
there
were
no
respondents
restraining
me
of
my
liberty
within
the
jurisdiction
within
the
district.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
an
earlier
decision
which
held
that
a
serviceman
on
leave
voluntary
had
a
place
other
than
duty
station
is
not
in
custody
at
that
point.
the
government
now
brings
--
takes
up
this
argument
and
argues
that
custody
--
you
can
be
in
custody
since
i
was
concededly
in
custody
on
the
day
i
filed
and
that
i
can
be
lawfully
in
arizona
which
i
was
on
the
day
that
i
filed
but
that
i
was
not
in
custody
in
arizona
under
the
meaning
of
2241.
it
is
my
conviction,
your
honors,
that
this
makes
an
artificial
distinction
that
i
am
not
attacking
col.
baker
or
dr.
seamans
personally.
what
i
am
attacking
is
the
effects
of
their
authority
which
are
--
manifest
upon
me
wherever
i
am.
in
this
case,
they
were
manifested
upon
me
at
a
place
i
had
been
assigned
for
duty
for
the
three
months
prior
to
my
filing
of
the
action
that
is
in
arizona
at
the
place
which
all
of
the
actions
which
gave
rise
to
the
habeas
corpus
action
occurred
that
is
arizona
state
university.
at
which
all
the
witnesses
for
a
hearing
if
it
should
ever
be
held
are
present
except
those
officers
of
the
air
force
who
might
be
needed
to
be
called
and
at
which
any
evidence
outside
of
that
under
the
control
of
the
respondents
is
that
is
university
records,
professors
records
and
things
like
this.
i
cannot
see
that
there
is
any
bar
in
the
statute
and
indeed
ahrens
v.
clark
which
mr.
douglas
--
in
which
mr.
douglas
wrote
the
opinion
--
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
opinion
in
1948
held
that
it
was
the
presence
of
the
petitioner
which
was
the
threshold
requirement
to
filing
of
the
habeas
corpus
action.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
effects
of
air
force
authority
on
me
in
arizona
that
i
was
contesting.
it
was
obviously
custody
since
i
was
forced
to
return
to
georgia.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
what
happened
was
i
filed
the
action
–
well,
all
of
the
indications
in
the
affidavit
of
lt.
mcdonald
which
appear
in
the
appendix
and
are
referred
to
it
in
the
government’s
brief
were
made
without
any
consultation
with
me
in
terms
of
what
days
i
was
attending
school
and
what
days
were
leave.
they’re
substantially
accurate
but
there
is
a
two
discrepancy.
however,
when
i
filed
the
action
it
was
on
my
next
to
the
last
day
of
leave.
i
immediately
called
my
commander
and
requested
an
extension
of
leave
which
was
verbally
granted.
subsequently,
written
orders
were
entered
issued
confirming
that
verbal
extension
of
the
leave.
there
was
no
question
that
i
was
anywhere
near
being
awol
or
running
a
fine
line.
this
was
all
done
with
the
knowledge
of
my
superiors
in
the
air
force,
my
immediate
superiors.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
i
really
feel
that
should
a
hearing
be
held
any
place
else
in
any
district
except
arizona
and
should
we
ever
have
to
get
to
the
substantive
issues
of
whether
i
was
cutting
classes,
whether
cutting
classes
demonstrates
a
lack
of
officer
potential,
whether
the
proceedings
did
follow
air
force
regs
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
call
these
witnesses,
without
them
i
cannot
prove
my
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
well
sir,
the
way
i
understand
1404
(a)
which
is
what
i
assume
is
being
referred
to
arizona
would
have
to
have
had
jurisdiction
originally.
it
would
have
to
have
been
able
to
have
been
brought
in
arizona
in
order
for
it
to
be
transferred
by
the
georgia
court
to
arizona
and
yet
if
this
court
now
finds
that
arizona
could
not
have
jurisdiction
because
i
was
not
permanently
stationed
there,
then
it
could
not
be
transferred.
the
concern
with
this
kind
of
question
seems
to
me
to
be
more
a
question
of
venue
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
pointed
out
than
really
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
question
but
that
i
was
in
custody
and
within
the
jurisdiction
lawfully
and
a
for
a
purpose
connected
with
my
service
that
district
is
not
incidental
to
either
the
action
or
my
military
duties.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
on
the
air
forces
bookkeeping,
yes
sir.
i
was
transferred
to
iceland
on
the
5th
of
january.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
believe
unfortunately,
your
honor
that
i
could
only
bring
it
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
well,
apparently
your
honor
that
it’s
been
held
by
this
court
never
directly
but
at
least
implicitly
that
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
jurisdiction
over
american
citizens
outside
any
other
district
courts
and
therefore
the
district
of
columbia
would
be
a
proper
district.
i
would
like
to
see,
your
honor
an
eventual
development
of
habeas
corpus
so
that
a
petitioner
could
file
either
in
a
district
in
which
he
is
feeling
the
effects
of
the
custody
or
in
which
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
but
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
that
would
be
the
district
of
columbia.
but
in
civil
litigation
it
appears
that
following
international
shoe.
the
courts
have
developed
a
fairness
doctrine
or
contract
theory
and
where
we
extend
this
right
to
civil
litigants.
i
really
cannot
see
that
it
would
be
of
tremendous
inconvenience
to
any
party
to
extend
it
to
military
petitions
for
habeas
corpus.
here
we
are
relatively
free
to
travel
at
certain
times
when
we
are
off
duty
or
when
we
are
on
leave.
there
are
incidents
which
occur
such
as
my
removal
from
the
program
in
arizona,
which
if
the
military
is
allowed
to
remove
me
at
their
will
or
whim,
thus
depriving
that
court
of
jurisdiction
we
are
sanctioning
what
is
in
essence
forum
shopping
by
the
military.
i
really
do
not
believe
sir
that
it
was
coincidence
that
following
my
removal
for
civil
rights
activities
from
arizona
state
university.
i
was
assigned
to
southern
georgia
with
all
due
respect
to
the
south
sir.
i
feel
that
the
government
felt
that
any
further
proceedings
would
be
looked
upon
more
dimly
in
the
middle
district
for
georgia
than
perhaps
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
judge
wyzanski
from
massachusetts
had
a
case
similar
to
the
one
you
described
where
a
gentleman
from
indiana
came
wandering
in
to
massachusetts
with
nothing
but
a
suitcase
and
a
petition.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
in
mccabe
v.
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
judge
wyzanski
looked
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
and
said,
“you
have
no
contacts
in
this
district.
this
is
the
first
time
you’ve
ever
been
in
massachusetts.
you
have
no
reason
for
filing
it
here.
go
elsewhere.”
i
feel
that
the
district
courts
are
more
than
competent
to
decide
whether
there
is
sufficient
contact
between
the
district
and
the
issues
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
but
that
was
sent
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
would
say
sir
that
broadly
for
those
people
contesting
their
induction
let’s
say
which
i
am
not,
this
is
an
enlistment,
but
their
induction
is
conscientious
objectors
for
instance.
much
of
their
evidence
to
prove
their
claims
might
in
fact
be
whether
a
local
draft
board
is.
if
a
person
is
inducted
in
new
york
city
and
then
sent
to
fort
benning,
georgia
the
army
may
hold
a
hearing
and
it
may
just
be
perfunctory
as
it
happen
in
several
cases.
if
he
is
then
forced
to
bring
the
action
in
georgia,
he
has
the
choice
of
either
expending
huge
sums
to
transport
his
witnesses
down
to
georgia
if
indeed
they
are
willing
to
come
or
not
in
fact
not
being
able
to
demonstrate
that
he
has
a
basis
in
fact
for
his
claim,
which
would
preclude
his
winning
his
action.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
because
that
is
the
district
with
the
most
significant
impact
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
am
searching
for
some
way
to
simply
say
i
would
like
to
be
fair
and
equitable.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
well,
i’ve
been
grappling
with
the
same
question
at
what
point
do
you
say
you
can’t
file.
i
would
say
that
where
the
context
of
the
district
--
within
a
district
are
immaterial
to
the
case
then
it’s
obviously
shouldn’t
be
brought
there.
if
the
contexts
are
crucial
to
the
case
then
that
is
obviously
a
permissible
district
and
as
in
most
of
the
rest
of
the
law
there
is
a
small
gray
area
in
between
which
i
think
should
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
courts
individually,
yes
sir.
your
honor,
i
would,
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions
on
this
issue,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
thank
you
your
honor,
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
in
rebuttal
your
honor.
i
was
not
expecting
an
attack
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
petition
at
this
point.
i
have
been
advised
by
mr.
reynolds
that
that
was
not
going
to
be
a
subjects
of
the
brief
or
argument.
however,
i’ll
get
to
that
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
assistant
solicitor
general,
sir
who
briefed
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
initially
sir,
mr.
griswold
now
hold
claims
that
i
was
not
in
custody
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed
and
i
would
like
to
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
page
12
of
the
government’s
brief
at
which
the
government
asserts
that
under
28
u.s.c
2241
he
as
clearly
“in
custody”
in
the
united
stats
force
at
the
time
he
sought
habeas
corpus
relief.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
that
was
the
initial
part
of
the
argument.
later
in
the
argument
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
did
say
that
in
response
to
a
question
that
he
did
not
think
that
i
was
in
custody
at
the
time
i
filed
the
case.
however,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
that’s
the
time
at
which
i
filed
the
case.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
but
i,
the
way
i
understood
the
solicitor
general’s
point
was
that
habeas
corpus
would
not
lie
at
such
a
time
because
of
the
tenuous
nature
of
restraints
at
that
particular
point
in
time
and
the
restraints
were
only
potential
to
be
imposed
when
i
had
to
return
to
georgia
and
yet
in
the
brief
they
can
see
that
it
was
properly
filed
since
i
was
in
custody
under
the
statute.
but
i
think
that
that
really
is
clearly.
i
think
the
more
important
question
is
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
which
at
least
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
little
bit.
it
is
claimed
that
exercise
of
this
court’s
jurisdiction
or
district
court’s
jurisdiction
in
cases
of
this
nature
would
dilute
the
writ
--
would
distort
its
purpose.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
orloff
v.
willoughby
which
the
government
cites
in
support
of
this
position.
the
court
said
that
they
would
not
interfere
in
military
duty
assignments
and
i
concur
wholeheartedly,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
proper
judicial
function
to
determine
what
assignment
a
man
in
the
military
should
be
put
to
work
in.
however
your
honor,
the
air
force
could
you
use
me
as
whatever
they
wanted.
they
could
have
kept
me
as
an
aircraft
instrument
repairman
if
they
had
commissioned
me.
i
might
have
been
the
only
2nd
lieutenant
aircraft
instrument
repairman
in
the
air
force
but
it
would
have
been
lawful.
however,
what
were
discussing
here
is
a
status
difference
between
that
of
an
enlisted
man
and
that
of
a
commissioned
officer
which
i
was
entitled
to
expect
under
the
program
for
which
i
reenlisted.
failing
to
commission
me,
i
submit
entitles
to
a
discharge
just
an
entitled
dr.
nelson
in
nelson
v.
peckham
where
the
fourth
circuit
ordered
him
discharge
because
the
army
refused
to
commission
him.
following
this
court’s
decision
in
orloff,
the
congress
revised
the
doctor’s
draft
act
to
require
commissioning
of
doctors
drafted
under
its
provisions
and
the
army
did
to
dr.
nelson
what
it
did
to
dr.
orloff
and
that
they
just
refused
to
commission
him
and
still
held
him.
he
brought
habeas
corpus
and
he
won.
there
was
another
case
which
i
don’t
have
the
site
off
in
california
citing
nelson
v.
peckham.
it
is
not
unusual
to
--
it
is
not
unusual
to
contest
status
differences.
admittedly,
this
is
the
first
case
i
have
seen
of
an
enlistment
status
question
but
i
don’t
think
as
the
fact
that
i
enlisted
dilutes
my
claim
anymore.
if
the
air
force
did
in
fact
unlawfully
changed
my
status
then
the
contract
is
void
and
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
custody
now
being
exercised
over
me.
your
honors,
i
submit
that
habeas
corpus
is
the
proper
vehicle
to
challenge
a
breach
and
void
enlistment
contract.
going
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
contradiction
in
the
government’s
position.
on
the
one
hand,
they
say
that
the
district
court
for
arizona
lacks
jurisdiction
because
there
is
no
respondent
within
the
district.
on
the
other
hand,
they
maintained
that
the
district
court
in
georgia
retains
jurisdiction
even
though
there
is
no
respondent
within
the
district
now.
colonel
baker,
i
submit
sir,
is
no
longer
a
proper
respondent
since
he
is
no
longer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
controlling
or
having
custody
of
me.
i
was
relieved
from
assignment
to
his
unit.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
even
though
there
remains
no
respondent
in
the
district?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
even
on
the
point
that
that
one
is
still
pending.
let’s
assume
that
argument
for
the
moment.
colonel
baker
has
no
control
over
me,
he
is
now
in
the
same
position
that
colonel
rederick
was
at
the
time
that
i
filed
the
petition.
he’s
an
officer
in
the
united
states
air
force.
he
is
commanding
a
military
unit
at
a
place
which
i
have
been
stationed.
he
has
no
direct
control
over
me.
my
commander
in
iceland,
i
filed
a
motion
with
the
clerk
to
amend
my
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
presumably
for
certiorari
also
to
add
my
commander
in
iceland
as
the
respondent.
he
and
dr.
seamans
have
the
custody
now
but
the
question
comes
down
to
when
we
have
the
nature
of
custody.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir
that
underlies
the
habeas
corpus
petition
that
gave
rise
to
the
action.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
to
raise
my
habeas
corpus
on
sir?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
nothing
at
all,
sir.
basically,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
contract
i
contend
the
contract
was
breached.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
your
honor,
i
would
i
think
if
enlistment
is
anything
but
carte
blanche
to
the
military.
if
promises
to
induce
the
military
--
an
enlistment
into
military
are
to
mean
anything
then
we
have
to
guard
against
are
arbitrary
use
of
power
by
the
military
authorities
should
we
give
them
license
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
i
think
what
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
because
in
my
case
sir
we
have
a
status
difference.
upon
my
reenlistment,
orders
which
designated
me
an
officer
trainee
became
effective
and
the
statute
under
which
the
air
force
institute
of
technology
operates
provides
for
training
--
professional
training
and
education
of
officers.
it
says
nothing
about
enlisted
men.
now
obviously,
something
happened
to
my
status
at
my
reenlistment.
it
was
something
different
from
just
that
of
a
plain
old
ordinary
enlisted
man
who
happens
to
be
a
nice
guy
so
they
decided
to
send
me
to
school.
your
honor,
i
reenlisted
so
that
i
might
make
the
air
force
a
career.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
that
was
a
wholly
discretionary
decision
on
their
part.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
that
was
a
local
decision.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
second
time?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
the
second
time
when
i
was
going
at
my
expense
i
was
allowed
to
complete
my
degree
requirements.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
contract
had
already
been
violated,
sir.
it
had
been
violated
while
i
was
in
school
the
first
time
under
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
because
at
that
point
there
was
an
impediment
to
filing.
i
had
to
at
least
attempt
to
exhaust
my
administrative
remedies
prior
to
filing
and
i
considered
that
my
administrative
remedies
were
exhausted
in
november
of
1968
when
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
air
force
denied
my
discharge
and
request
for
hearing.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
pardon
sir?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no,
sir.
i
have
reenlisted
in
1965.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
and
then
the
alleged
breach
occurred
in
june
of
1968.
my
remedies
from
that
breach
were
not
exhausted
until
after
i
was
removed
from
arizona
and
assigned
to
georgia.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
and
so
what
we
are
faced
with
is
the
question
of
whether
the
military
authorities
can
take
action
which
gives
rise
to
a
claim
for
habeas
corpus
then
remove
the
serviceman
from
that
jurisdiction
prior
to
as
being
able
to
initiate
action
because
of
some
impediments
or
other.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir,
but
assuming
that
we
did
have
habeas
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
cannot
truly
imagine
sir
any
other
theory
under
which
to
bring
this
case.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
air
force
has
to
make
me
an
officer
certainly
if
they
made
an
officer,
i
would
probably,
it
would
suitable
adjustments
and
payments
and
rank
i
would
probably
be
required
to
drop
the
action
and
serve
out
my
enlistment
because
every
application
i’ve
made
has
been
the
alternative,
either
a
discharge
or
reinstatement
in
commissioning.
however,
we
are
talking
about
a
status
difference
and
if
the
air
force
within
itself
refuses
to
even
grant
me
a
hearing
at
any
time
which
they
have
for
three
years
now
on
my
claims
that
i
was
unfairly
eliminated
from
this
program,
unlawfully
eliminated
and
denied
the
status
of
a
commissioned
officer
for
which
i
had
reenlisted,
i
can
see
no
other
theory
under
which
to
bring
it
than
habeas
corpus
which
challenges
unlawful
restraints
by
governmental
authorities.
your
honor,
if
you
have
no
further
questions--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
at
this
point,
sir
i
would
like
to
be
discharged
from
the
air
force.
i
cannot
see
that
even
if
the
air
force
commissioned
me,
i
could
make
it
a
career
successfully
after
the
publicity
that
has
been
attending
to
the
case
and
very
truthfully
since
my
initiation
of
the
proceedings,
i
discovered
that
i
have
hopefully
some
aptitude
for
the
law
and
would
like
to
make
the
law
a
career.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
sir?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
that
under
law
is
it
that
at
the
moment
that
contract
for
under
which
i
was
reenlisted
is
void.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
the
entire
contract
since
it
was
a
contract
based
upon
my
--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
commission
me,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
government
conceded
in
orloff
v.
willoughby
that
had
he
been
entitled
to
a
commission.
this
would
have
been
a
proper
action
in
habeas
corpus
but
then
they
denied
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
commission
and
the
court
agreed
with
him.
the
facts
in
this
case
since
we
have
no
evidence
on
entitlements
under
the
enlistment
agreement,
since
we’ve
never
been
able
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
remain
from
my
allegations
in
the
petition
that
is
that
i
was
entitled,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
in
this
particular
action?
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
in
this
particular
action
to
affect
my
release
from
custody?yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir.
to
affect,
to
force--
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
no
sir,
not
any
part.
the
material
central
point
which
goes
to
my
status
on
that
point,
i
think
when
the
air
force
refuses
to
honor
the
central
part
of
the
contract,
i
think
that
yes
sir,
i
am
entitled
to
asked
to
be
discharged.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
of
late
with
the
expenses
[laughter].
but
no
sir
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
i
have
up
until
this
point
i
have
never
asked.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes
sir
and
i
contend
that
the
courts
have
no
power
to
order
my
commissioning.
mr.
herbert
p.
schlanger
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
your
honors.
