justice
thurgood
marshall
haven’t
you
got
also
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
pending
in
georgia
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
longer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
solicitor
general,
he
didn’t
have
to
report
to
anybody
in
arizona
any
military
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
supervision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
they
found
out
that
he
didn’t
attend
classes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
even
if
there
was
a
possibility
could
bring
habeas
on
the
first
case
you
say
that
is
certainly
not
true
in
the
second.
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren’t
you
really
arguing
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
but
the
solicitor
general
said
you
are
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
do
you
have
other
than
an
alleged
breach
of
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
you
want
to
establish
a
precedent
that
if
being
enlist
and
is
in
commission
as
sergeant
that
he
has
a
breach
of
contract
action
which
he
can
bring
by
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
grant
all
of
that
as
habeas
corpus
the
proper
vehicle
to
attack
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
the
air
force
promise
that
you
could
go
to
school
for
three
months
and
they
only
let
you
go
for
two
months
that
would
void
the
enlistment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it?
why
is
it
a
different
view?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
they
have
prevented
you
from
going
the
second
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
let
you
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
they
revoked
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
what
happened
that
violate
the
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
didn’t
you
bring
habeas
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
it
also
have
ended
by
your
reenlistment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
also
have
ended
by
your
reenlistment?
couldn’t
your
administrative
remedy
have
stopped
when
you
reenlisted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
thee
solicitor
disagrees
with
that.
he
hasn’t
agreed
that
you’ve
ever
had
a
right
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
you
get
a
relief
from
the
army
for
breach
of
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
basis
that
government
has
breached
its
contract
with
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
part
of
it
was
breached?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
they
agree
to
do
that
they
have
not
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
commission?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
to
get
that
tried
in
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
is
the
only
way
you
could
bring
a
suit
against
the
government
by
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
breach
of
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
affect
your
release
from
custody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
if
they
breach
any
part
of
a
contract
with
you,
you
can
get
out
of
the
army
completely?
justice
thurgood

you
