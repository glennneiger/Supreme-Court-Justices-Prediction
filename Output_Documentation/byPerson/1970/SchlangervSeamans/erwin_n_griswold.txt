mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
important,
though
from
some
points
of
view
a
somewhat
exotic
case.
it
is
important
because
it
involves
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
importance
of
which
and
its
proper
preservation
and
utilization
cannot
be
exaggerated,
and
it
is
exotic
because
the
present
case
seems
so
foreign
to
the
true
function
of
the
writ.
it
reminds
of
the
course
i
once
took
in
advance
equity
from
professor
chaffee
where
we
learn
much
about
bills
of
interpleader
and
then
we
learn
more
about
another
bill
called
a
bill
in
the
nature
of
a
bill
of
interpleader
but
perhaps
this
case
can
be
better
understood
if
it
is
thought
of
as
a
case
involving
an
application
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
rather
than
habeas
corpus
itself.
we
recognize
of
course
that
habeas
corpus
is
not
limited
now
as
it
once
was
to
persons
who
are
actually
imprisoned.
it
has
been
made
available
to
persons
whose
liberty
is
significantly
restraint
and
thus
has
been
held
applicable
to
persons
who
are
denied
admission
to
the
country
to
persons
on
parole
or
probation
and
to
service
matters.
i
think
i
might
say
please
say
though
that
there
has
never
been
a
serviceman
case
like
this
one
in
the
history
of
the
writ
or
its
analogs.
it
is
important
to
get
the
facts
clearly.
sergeant
schlanger
was
not
hijacked
or
impressed.
he
was
not
inducted
into
the
service
as
he
himself
alleges
in
his
petition
in
the
district
court,
paragraph
–
page
4
of
the
appendix.
he
enlisted
in
the
air
force
on
december
9,
1965
for
a
period
six
years,
a
period
which
has
not
expired.
he
makes
no
claim
of
conscience
and
does
not
suggest
that
he
is
entitled
to
discharge
under
any
regulation
of
the
department
of
defense
or
of
the
air
force
as
is
the
case
for
example
of
the
man
who
seeks
discharge
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
objection
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
there
is
a
specific
regulation
that
provides
a
procedure
that
says
that
such
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
discharge.
he
does
allege
a
breach
of
contract
but
i
suggest
that
it
is
a
distortion
of
the
great
writ
to
say
that
it
can
appropriately
be
used
to
review
the
military
determinations
involved
here.
as
a
petitioner
alleged,
he
reenlisted
in
the
air
force
for
the
purpose
entering
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program
and
he
was
pursuant
of
that
program
assigned
to
the
arizona
state
university
in
a
program
designed
to
lead
to
a
degree.
he
entered
the
university
in
december
1965
with
his
tuition
paid
and
received
an
enhanced
air
force
salary.
he
continued
in
this
program
until
june
1968
when
he
was
removed
from
the
program
by
his
superior
officers
for
failure
to
attend
classes
regularly.
he
was
then
reassigned
to
moody
air
force
base
in
georgia
where
he
returned
in
july
1968.
it
is
important
to
note
that
if
there
had
been
a
breach
of
contract
and
if
that
breach
of
contract
was
for
some
reason
now
unknown
sufficient
to
relieve
him
of
his
responsibilities
to
the
air
force
that
had
occurred
by
june
or
july
1968.
all
of
the
events
of
which
the
petitioner
complains
whatever
their
effect
may
be
occurred
before
july
1968.
the
petitioner
then
returned
to
georgia
where
as
far
as
we
know
he
performed
well
in
the
duties
which
were
assigned
to
him
in
may
1969
nearly
a
year
after
the
events
of
which
he
complains
and
in
pursuant
to
his
application
to
the
air
force,
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
return
to
arizona
state
university
for
the
approximately
two
months
needed
to
complete
his
work
for
a
degree.
this
was
under
what
is
called
operation
bootstrap
which
is
a
voluntary
program.
he
went
at
his
own
expense
on
what
is
called
permissive
tdy.
tdy
being
air
force
is
for
temporary
duty.
this
means
that
he
was
not
ordered
to
go,
he
was
permitted
to
go.
he
could
have
terminated
his
participation
in
operation
bootstrap
and
returned
to
his
permanent
duty
station
at
any
time.
the
petitioner
did
go
to
arizona
state
university.
he
completed
the
work
for
his
degree
and
he
received
it.
this
was
on
august
22,
1969.
he
still
had
four
days
of
leave
available.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
bachelor
of
science,
mr.
schlanger
advises
me.
he
still
had
four
days
of
leave
available
plus
a
day
of
travel
for
georgia.
the
last
day
of
leave
as
i
figured
would
have
been
august
26
and
august
27th
would
have
been
the
day
assigned
for
travel
to
the
base
in
georgia.
it
was
on
august
27th
that
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona.
on
september
15,
1969
his
15
days
of
leave
was
retroactively
extended
to
45
days
so
as
to
avoid
carrying
him
an
absent
without
leave
status
after
august
27.
he
advises
us
today
that
that
was
pursuant
to
telephonic
arrangements
made
at
the
time
and
as
far
as
i
know,
that
is
entirely
accurate
though
it
is
not
in
the
record.
the
45-day
expired
on
september
27,
1969
but
he
actually
returned
to
moody
air
force
base
on
september
21,
1969.
it
is
significant
i
think
that
thereafter
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
this
petition
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
sergeant
schlanger
took
an
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
that
appeal
was
recently
dismissed
on
his
own
motion.
as
far
as
i
know,
it
is
still
pending
before
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
georgia.
the
issue
on
which
the
court
previously
decided
the
case
that
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
as
sergeant
schlanger
says
is
now
disposed
of.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
habeas
corpus
petition
is
not
still
pending
on
the
--
for
hearing
in
the
district
court
in
georgia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
was
filed
with
the
clerk
by
sergeant
schlanger.
a
copy
was
furnished
to
us.
he
did
move
for
dismissal
of
the
appeal
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot
because
the
administrative
remedies
had
in
the
interval
been
exhausted
on
the
further
ground
that
he
had
been
transferred
to
iceland
so
that
in
some
way
the
georgia
court
had
lost
jurisdiction,
though
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true
if
it
had
jurisdiction
when
the
proceeding
began
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
dismiss
the
appeal
from
the
district
court’s
decision
on
sergeant
schlanger’s
motion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
district
court’s
decision
had
been
to
deny
the
application
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
if
that
court
is
now
satisfied
that
the
administrative
remedies
have
been
exhausted,
the
petition
is
still
pending
before
the
district
--
middle
district
of
georgia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
a
new
application
could
be
filed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
might
be
doubtful
whether
a
new
application
could
be
filed
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia
but
the
one
which
is
pending
there
is
undoubtedly
remains
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
georgia
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
could
file
in
the
district
of
columbia,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
if
he
is
outside
of
the
united
states.
if
he
is
within
the
united
states,
it
would
still
be
our
position
that
he
could
not
file
under
the
district
of
columbia
unless
there
were
some
contact
with
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
by
the
grace
of
the
air
force
and
that
the
request
of
the
solicitor
general’s
office.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
certainly
can
file
but
whether
the
district
court
or
the
district
of
columbia
has
jurisdiction
and
that
situation
i
would
not
want
to
be
completely
clear
on
but
i
suspect
it
has
if
his
orders
--
if
he
is
no
longer
under
any
duty
to
report
to
the
base
in
georgia.
if
he
is
under
a
duty
to
report
to
the
base
in
georgia,
then
i
would
contend
that
the
jurisdiction
is
in
georgia.
in
preserving
the
great
writ
for
it
is
all
important
function
and
extending
it
to
new
areas
in
the
light
of
modern
conditions,
it
is
important
i
submit
that
it
not
be
diluted
by
being
used
to
review
all
the
varied
controversies
which
may
arise
between
the
armed
forces
and
their
members.
historically,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
had
clear
geographical
limitations.
there
must
be
a
body
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
there
must
be
a
person
likewise
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
who
could
produce
that
body.
habeas
corpus
you
have
the
body.
those
conditions
are
lacking
here.
it
is
true
that
sergeant
schlanger
was
physically
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arizona
court
on
the
day
he
filed
his
petition
but
in
our
view
he
was
not
in
custody
there
and
there
was
no
one
in
arizona
having
jurisdiction
over
him
and
he
did
not
allege
that
there
was.
the
relevant
allegation
is
on
page
3
of
the
appendix,
paragraph
4
of
the
petition
the
honorable
robert
seamans
jr.,
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
colonel
homer
baker
commander
moody
air
force
base
georgia
are
the
persons
who
are
at
present
unlawfully
restraining
applicant
of
his
liberty
as
it
is
more
particular
--
more
fully
particularized
herein.
then
he
goes
on
to
say
colonel
rederick
was
the
rotc
commander
at
asu
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
colonel
rederick
was
the
rotc
commander
at
asu
but
there
is
no
allegation
that
he
had
or
was
exercising
any
authority
over
sergeant
schlanger.
and
i
think
the
nature
of
the
issue
was
quite
clearly
in
the
petitioner’s
petition
in
this
court
when
he
said
that
the
question
presented
was,
does
a
district
court
lack
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
lawfulness
of
restraint
exercise
over
a
petitioner
within
its
district
when
the
person
responsible
for
the
restraint
is
in
another
state?
and
that
we
submit
is
the
situation
which
is
involved
here.
moreover,
sergeant
schlanger
was
not
ordered
to
be
in
arizona.
he
was
there
in
a
permissive
status
by
his
own
choice,
for
his
own
purpose
and
was
on
leave
when
the
petition
was
filed.
no
one
was
confining
or
restraining
in
arizona.
he
was
free
to
go
to
california
or
ohio
or
any
place
else,
mexico
on
his
way
back
to
georgia
as
long
as
he
got
back
to
georgia
by
the
time
specified.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
the
writ.
this
is
essentially
a
contract
controversy,
a
controversy
relating
to
the
internal
operation
of
the
military.
it
may
be
that
sergeant
schlanger
has
a
cause
of
action
under
the
tucker
act
in
the
court
of
claims
or
in
some
united
states
district
court.
i
know
of
no
basis
whatever
for
his
suggestion
that
because
of
a
breach
of
contract,
if
there
is
one
he
is
entitled
to
discharge
from
the
air
force.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
that
he
is
in
custody
and
rightfully
in
custody
and
that
a
breach
of
contract
would
not
entitle
into
a
release
from
custody.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
question
on
the
merits
but
arises
on
the
face
of
the
petition
and
is
i
submit
a
further
ground
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
dismissing
the
petition.
now
it
is
true
that
district
court
dismissed
it
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
i
should
think
that
by
general
demurrer
it
could
be
found
that
the
petition
itself
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
even
if
there
were
jurisdiction
and
we
are
entitled
to
present
any
grounds
which
will
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
it’s
not
directly
stated
in
the
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
only
being
the
case
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
only
in
case
of
the
court
found
there
was
jurisdiction.
it
was
--
be
our
position
that
the
judgment
ought
nevertheless
to
be
affirmed
because
it
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
properly
sounding
in
habeas
corpus.
the
case
here
is
very
much
like
that
in
jarrett
against
resor,
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
which
the
decision
below
is
based.
in
the
jarrett
case,
an
officer
went
to
berkeley
california
on
leave.
while
there
he
sought
habeas
corpus
naming
no
respondents
in
the
district
although
they
were
within
other
districts
in
california.
the
court
held
that
being
on
leave,
jarrett
was
not
under
restraint,
he
was
under
orders
to
go
to
vietnam
but
he
was
at
the
time
on
leave.
he
was
not
in
the
district
under
orders
and
it
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
habeas
corpus.
we
recognize
fully
that
the
great
writ
should
be
kept
flexible.
cases
have
already
have
arisen
or
a
serviceman
is
overseas
and
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
has
been
found
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
when
the
relevant
service
secretary
has
made
the
respondent,
and
it
is
possible
to
conceive
a
situation
where
a
man
is
stationed
in
a
place
where
he
has
no
commanding
officer.
some
remote
island
in
alaska
or
something
of
that
kind
but
that
is
not
this
case
for
the
petitioner
here
was
not
stationed
in
arizona.
he
went
there
at
his
own
request,
at
his
own
expense
and
for
his
own
purpose.
the
habeas
corpus
statute
requires
that
the
applicant
be
in
custody
within
the
district
in
no
true
or
substantive
sense
was
the
petitioner
here
in
custody
in
arizona
on
the
day
he
filed
his
petition
after
his
education
was
over
and
he
was
on
leave.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
person
whatever
mr.--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
supervision,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that’s
at
a
different
time.
when
he
was
there
under
the
airman’s
training
program
before
1968,
he
was
there
under
orders
and
he
was
under
an
obligation
to
report
and
they
apparently
did
not
like
the
way
he
acted
and
they
removed
him
from
that
program.
he
then
went
back
to
georgia
and
a
year
later,
he
came
back
to
arizona
at
his
expense
at
his
own
request
on
leave
to
complete
his
education
under
a
different
program
operation
bootstrap.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that
is
precisely
our
position,
this
might
have
been
a
different
case
had
habeas
corpus
been
brought
in
1968
although
i
would
still
say
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
issue
that
ought
to
be
under
taken
to
be
resolved
in
habeas
corpus.
it’s
crucially
important
that
the
habeas
corpus
power
be
protected
and
that
it
remain
fully
available
for
its
proper
purposes
but
is
equally
true
that
the
habeas
corpus
power
should
not
be
converted
into
a
means
of
general
review
of
intra-military
decisions
as
this
court
pointed
in
our
orloff
against
willoughby
that
and
i
quote,
“would
be
a
disruptive
force
as
to
affairs
peculiarly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
authorities.”
in
this
case,
sergeant
schlanger
was
admittedly
enlisted
for
a
period
of
six
years.
that
was
more
than
five
years
ago.
during
that
period,
he
has
received
a
college
education
and
nearly
all
of
which
was
at
public
expense
including
his
salary.
since
he
filed
this
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
he
has
been
on
leave
status
from
december
9,
1969
much
of
it
by
order
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
until
july
8,
1970
when
mr.
justice
black
refused
to
continue
his
leave
that
was
for
a
period
of
nearly
seven
months.
shortly
after
this
court
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari,
he
was
again
granted
various
periods
of
leave
and
finally,
he
was
granted
leave
on
december
25th
until
the
present
time
for
nearly
two
months.
thus
there
have
been
more
than
9
months
and
nearly
10
months
of
leave
connected
with
this
case.
sergeant
schlanger
was
ordered
to
iceland
in
january
and
as
i
have
indicated
that
was
deferred
at
the
request
to
my
office
until
after
the
hearing
today.
by
great
energy
and
persistence,
sergeant
schlanger
has
held
the
air
force
at
bay
for
nearly
nineteen
months.
it
may
be
that
this
is
not
within
the
legitimate
purpose
and
function
of
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
even
if
it
be
held
that
it
is
not
a
perquisite
to
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
that
there
would
be
someone
within
the
district
who
has
custody
of
the
petitioner,
it
is
still
our
contention
that
the
district
court
here
properly
held
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
this
petition.
habeas
corpus
petitions
are
not
avenues
to
advisory
opinions.
it
still
remains
a
constitutional
truism
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
only
over
cases
or
controversies.
a
case
or
controversy
requires
two
parties
both
of
whom
are
properly
before
the
court.
here
there
is
only
one
party
before
the
court
in
arizona
and
that
is
sergeant
schlanger.
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
colonel
homer
baker
are
the
only
persons
alleged
to
be
restraining
the
petitioner
of
his
liberty
and
neither
one
is
within
the
district
of
arizona.
district
courts
do
not
have
nationwide
jurisdiction
in
habeas
corpus
and
there
are
manifest
reasons
why
congress
has
never
provided
that
they
should
have
such
jurisdiction.
there
is
the
problem
of
transportation
and
there
is
the
problem
of
forum
shopping.
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
arizona
in
sergeant
schlanger’s
case,
then
any
serviceman
on
leave
can
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
any
court
he
chooses
by
simply
going
there
or
perhaps
by
filing
such
a
petition
by
mail
or
through
local
counsel.
that
seems
obviously
undesirable
and
in
no
senses
it
required
by
any
legitimate
concern
to
make
the
great
writ
available
when
it
is
needed.
there
is
of
course
section
1391
(e)
of
title
28
which
provides
for
nationwide
service
of
process
on
government
officers
in
civil
actions.
we
would
contend
first
the
section
1391
(e)
does
not
apply
to
habeas
corpus
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
the
habeas
corpus
and
need
not
be
found
to
apply
the
habeas
corpus
to
keep
that
writ
effective.
even
if
section
1391
(e)
does
apply
in
habeas
corpus
it
is
not
applicable
here
since
the
cause
of
action
did
not
arise
arizona
and
since
it
appears
clearly
on
the
face
of
the
petition
that
sergeant
schlanger
is
not
resident
in
arizona
that
is
domicile
there
which
is
the
proper
construction
of
that
word
in
the
statute
as
a
number
of
courts
have
held.
and
finally,
we
would
contend
that
even
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
arizona
this
a
case
which
should
be
transferred
to
the
middle
district
of
georgia
or
to
the
district
of
columbia.
sergeant
schlanger
suggests
that
the
witnesses
and
the
evidence
are
in
arizona
but
that
simply
highlights
the
fact
that
this
is
essentially
a
breach
of
contract
suit
not
a
habeas
corpus
matter
and
as
a
breach
of
contract
suit,
it
is
very
clear
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
in
arizona
under
this
petition.
unless
this
case
is
brought
to
a
conclusion,
it
is
obvious
that
there
will
be
endless
further
proceedings.
the
court
below
is
correct
in
holding
that
the
district
court
for
arizona
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
its
judgment
should
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
when?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
would
have
expired
in
19--
late
in
1971
except
that
there
is
provision
that
when
certain
types
of
permissive
leave
are
granted
such
as
that
for
which
he
went
to
the
university
of
arizona
in
1969
not
only
is
that
added
on
but
triple
is
added
on
so
that
i
understand
that
somewhat
more
than
a
year
still
remains
on
his
enlistment
but
i
do
not
know
the
exact
time
of
expiring.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
important,
though
from
some
points
of
view
a
somewhat
exotic
case.
it
is
important
because
it
involves
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
importance
of
which
and
its
proper
preservation
and
utilization
cannot
be
exaggerated,
and
it
is
exotic
because
the
present
case
seems
so
foreign
to
the
true
function
of
the
writ.
it
reminds
of
the
course
i
once
took
in
advance
equity
from
professor
chaffee
where
we
learn
much
about
bills
of
interpleader
and
then
we
learn
more
about
another
bill
called
a
bill
in
the
nature
of
a
bill
of
interpleader
but
perhaps
this
case
can
be
better
understood
if
it
is
thought
of
as
a
case
involving
an
application
in
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
rather
than
habeas
corpus
itself.
we
recognize
of
course
that
habeas
corpus
is
not
limited
now
as
it
once
was
to
persons
who
are
actually
imprisoned.
it
has
been
made
available
to
persons
whose
liberty
is
significantly
restraint
and
thus
has
been
held
applicable
to
persons
who
are
denied
admission
to
the
country
to
persons
on
parole
or
probation
and
to
service
matters.
i
think
i
might
say
please
say
though
that
there
has
never
been
a
serviceman
case
like
this
one
in
the
history
of
the
writ
or
its
analogs.
it
is
important
to
get
the
facts
clearly.
sergeant
schlanger
was
not
hijacked
or
impressed.
he
was
not
inducted
into
the
service
as
he
himself
alleges
in
his
petition
in
the
district
court,
paragraph
–
page
4
of
the
appendix.
he
enlisted
in
the
air
force
on
december
9,
1965
for
a
period
six
years,
a
period
which
has
not
expired.
he
makes
no
claim
of
conscience
and
does
not
suggest
that
he
is
entitled
to
discharge
under
any
regulation
of
the
department
of
defense
or
of
the
air
force
as
is
the
case
for
example
of
the
man
who
seeks
discharge
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
objection
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
there
is
a
specific
regulation
that
provides
a
procedure
that
says
that
such
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
discharge.
he
does
allege
a
breach
of
contract
but
i
suggest
that
it
is
a
distortion
of
the
great
writ
to
say
that
it
can
appropriately
be
used
to
review
the
military
determinations
involved
here.
as
a
petitioner
alleged,
he
reenlisted
in
the
air
force
for
the
purpose
entering
the
airman’s
education
and
commissioning
program
and
he
was
pursuant
of
that
program
assigned
to
the
arizona
state
university
in
a
program
designed
to
lead
to
a
degree.
he
entered
the
university
in
december
1965
with
his
tuition
paid
and
received
an
enhanced
air
force
salary.
he
continued
in
this
program
until
june
1968
when
he
was
removed
from
the
program
by
his
superior
officers
for
failure
to
attend
classes
regularly.
he
was
then
reassigned
to
moody
air
force
base
in
georgia
where
he
returned
in
july
1968.
it
is
important
to
note
that
if
there
had
been
a
breach
of
contract
and
if
that
breach
of
contract
was
for
some
reason
now
unknown
sufficient
to
relieve
him
of
his
responsibilities
to
the
air
force
that
had
occurred
by
june
or
july
1968.
all
of
the
events
of
which
the
petitioner
complains
whatever
their
effect
may
be
occurred
before
july
1968.
the
petitioner
then
returned
to
georgia
where
as
far
as
we
know
he
performed
well
in
the
duties
which
were
assigned
to
him
in
may
1969
nearly
a
year
after
the
events
of
which
he
complains
and
in
pursuant
to
his
application
to
the
air
force,
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
return
to
arizona
state
university
for
the
approximately
two
months
needed
to
complete
his
work
for
a
degree.
this
was
under
what
is
called
operation
bootstrap
which
is
a
voluntary
program.
he
went
at
his
own
expense
on
what
is
called
permissive
tdy.
tdy
being
air
force
is
for
temporary
duty.
this
means
that
he
was
not
ordered
to
go,
he
was
permitted
to
go.
he
could
have
terminated
his
participation
in
operation
bootstrap
and
returned
to
his
permanent
duty
station
at
any
time.
the
petitioner
did
go
to
arizona
state
university.
he
completed
the
work
for
his
degree
and
he
received
it.
this
was
on
august
22,
1969.
he
still
had
four
days
of
leave
available.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
bachelor
of
science,
mr.
schlanger
advises
me.
he
still
had
four
days
of
leave
available
plus
a
day
of
travel
for
georgia.
the
last
day
of
leave
as
i
figured
would
have
been
august
26
and
august
27th
would
have
been
the
day
assigned
for
travel
to
the
base
in
georgia.
it
was
on
august
27th
that
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona.
on
september
15,
1969
his
15
days
of
leave
was
retroactively
extended
to
45
days
so
as
to
avoid
carrying
him
an
absent
without
leave
status
after
august
27.
he
advises
us
today
that
that
was
pursuant
to
telephonic
arrangements
made
at
the
time
and
as
far
as
i
know,
that
is
entirely
accurate
though
it
is
not
in
the
record.
the
45-day
expired
on
september
27,
1969
but
he
actually
returned
to
moody
air
force
base
on
september
21,
1969.
it
is
significant
i
think
that
thereafter
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
this
petition
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
sergeant
schlanger
took
an
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
that
appeal
was
recently
dismissed
on
his
own
motion.
as
far
as
i
know,
it
is
still
pending
before
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
georgia.
the
issue
on
which
the
court
previously
decided
the
case
that
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
as
sergeant
schlanger
says
is
now
disposed
of.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
habeas
corpus
petition
is
not
still
pending
on
the
--
for
hearing
in
the
district
court
in
georgia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
was
filed
with
the
clerk
by
sergeant
schlanger.
a
copy
was
furnished
to
us.
he
did
move
for
dismissal
of
the
appeal
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot
because
the
administrative
remedies
had
in
the
interval
been
exhausted
on
the
further
ground
that
he
had
been
transferred
to
iceland
so
that
in
some
way
the
georgia
court
had
lost
jurisdiction,
though
i
do
not
believe
that
is
true
if
it
had
jurisdiction
when
the
proceeding
began
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
dismiss
the
appeal
from
the
district
court’s
decision
on
sergeant
schlanger’s
motion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
district
court’s
decision
had
been
to
deny
the
application
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
if
that
court
is
now
satisfied
that
the
administrative
remedies
have
been
exhausted,
the
petition
is
still
pending
before
the
district
--
middle
district
of
georgia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
a
new
application
could
be
filed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
might
be
doubtful
whether
a
new
application
could
be
filed
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia
but
the
one
which
is
pending
there
is
undoubtedly
remains
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
georgia
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
could
file
in
the
district
of
columbia,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
if
he
is
outside
of
the
united
states.
if
he
is
within
the
united
states,
it
would
still
be
our
position
that
he
could
not
file
under
the
district
of
columbia
unless
there
were
some
contact
with
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
by
the
grace
of
the
air
force
and
that
the
request
of
the
solicitor
general’s
office.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
certainly
can
file
but
whether
the
district
court
or
the
district
of
columbia
has
jurisdiction
and
that
situation
i
would
not
want
to
be
completely
clear
on
but
i
suspect
it
has
if
his
orders
--
if
he
is
no
longer
under
any
duty
to
report
to
the
base
in
georgia.
if
he
is
under
a
duty
to
report
to
the
base
in
georgia,
then
i
would
contend
that
the
jurisdiction
is
in
georgia.
in
preserving
the
great
writ
for
it
is
all
important
function
and
extending
it
to
new
areas
in
the
light
of
modern
conditions,
it
is
important
i
submit
that
it
not
be
diluted
by
being
used
to
review
all
the
varied
controversies
which
may
arise
between
the
armed
forces
and
their
members.
historically,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
had
clear
geographical
limitations.
there
must
be
a
body
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
there
must
be
a
person
likewise
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
who
could
produce
that
body.
habeas
corpus
you
have
the
body.
those
conditions
are
lacking
here.
it
is
true
that
sergeant
schlanger
was
physically
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arizona
court
on
the
day
he
filed
his
petition
but
in
our
view
he
was
not
in
custody
there
and
there
was
no
one
in
arizona
having
jurisdiction
over
him
and
he
did
not
allege
that
there
was.
the
relevant
allegation
is
on
page
3
of
the
appendix,
paragraph
4
of
the
petition
the
honorable
robert
seamans
jr.,
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
colonel
homer
baker
commander
moody
air
force
base
georgia
are
the
persons
who
are
at
present
unlawfully
restraining
applicant
of
his
liberty
as
it
is
more
particular
--
more
fully
particularized
herein.
then
he
goes
on
to
say
colonel
rederick
was
the
rotc
commander
at
asu
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
colonel
rederick
was
the
rotc
commander
at
asu
but
there
is
no
allegation
that
he
had
or
was
exercising
any
authority
over
sergeant
schlanger.
and
i
think
the
nature
of
the
issue
was
quite
clearly
in
the
petitioner’s
petition
in
this
court
when
he
said
that
the
question
presented
was,
does
a
district
court
lack
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
lawfulness
of
restraint
exercise
over
a
petitioner
within
its
district
when
the
person
responsible
for
the
restraint
is
in
another
state?
and
that
we
submit
is
the
situation
which
is
involved
here.
moreover,
sergeant
schlanger
was
not
ordered
to
be
in
arizona.
he
was
there
in
a
permissive
status
by
his
own
choice,
for
his
own
purpose
and
was
on
leave
when
the
petition
was
filed.
no
one
was
confining
or
restraining
in
arizona.
he
was
free
to
go
to
california
or
ohio
or
any
place
else,
mexico
on
his
way
back
to
georgia
as
long
as
he
got
back
to
georgia
by
the
time
specified.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
the
writ.
this
is
essentially
a
contract
controversy,
a
controversy
relating
to
the
internal
operation
of
the
military.
it
may
be
that
sergeant
schlanger
has
a
cause
of
action
under
the
tucker
act
in
the
court
of
claims
or
in
some
united
states
district
court.
i
know
of
no
basis
whatever
for
his
suggestion
that
because
of
a
breach
of
contract,
if
there
is
one
he
is
entitled
to
discharge
from
the
air
force.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
that
he
is
in
custody
and
rightfully
in
custody
and
that
a
breach
of
contract
would
not
entitle
into
a
release
from
custody.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
question
on
the
merits
but
arises
on
the
face
of
the
petition
and
is
i
submit
a
further
ground
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
dismissing
the
petition.
now
it
is
true
that
district
court
dismissed
it
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
i
should
think
that
by
general
demurrer
it
could
be
found
that
the
petition
itself
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
even
if
there
were
jurisdiction
and
we
are
entitled
to
present
any
grounds
which
will
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
it’s
not
directly
stated
in
the
brief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
only
being
the
case
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
only
in
case
of
the
court
found
there
was
jurisdiction.
it
was
--
be
our
position
that
the
judgment
ought
nevertheless
to
be
affirmed
because
it
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
properly
sounding
in
habeas
corpus.
the
case
here
is
very
much
like
that
in
jarrett
against
resor,
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
which
the
decision
below
is
based.
in
the
jarrett
case,
an
officer
went
to
berkeley
california
on
leave.
while
there
he
sought
habeas
corpus
naming
no
respondents
in
the
district
although
they
were
within
other
districts
in
california.
the
court
held
that
being
on
leave,
jarrett
was
not
under
restraint,
he
was
under
orders
to
go
to
vietnam
but
he
was
at
the
time
on
leave.
he
was
not
in
the
district
under
orders
and
it
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
habeas
corpus.
we
recognize
fully
that
the
great
writ
should
be
kept
flexible.
cases
have
already
have
arisen
or
a
serviceman
is
overseas
and
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
has
been
found
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
when
the
relevant
service
secretary
has
made
the
respondent,
and
it
is
possible
to
conceive
a
situation
where
a
man
is
stationed
in
a
place
where
he
has
no
commanding
officer.
some
remote
island
in
alaska
or
something
of
that
kind
but
that
is
not
this
case
for
the
petitioner
here
was
not
stationed
in
arizona.
he
went
there
at
his
own
request,
at
his
own
expense
and
for
his
own
purpose.
the
habeas
corpus
statute
requires
that
the
applicant
be
in
custody
within
the
district
in
no
true
or
substantive
sense
was
the
petitioner
here
in
custody
in
arizona
on
the
day
he
filed
his
petition
after
his
education
was
over
and
he
was
on
leave.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
person
whatever
mr.--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
supervision,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that’s
at
a
different
time.
when
he
was
there
under
the
airman’s
training
program
before
1968,
he
was
there
under
orders
and
he
was
under
an
obligation
to
report
and
they
apparently
did
not
like
the
way
he
acted
and
they
removed
him
from
that
program.
he
then
went
back
to
georgia
and
a
year
later,
he
came
back
to
arizona
at
his
expense
at
his
own
request
on
leave
to
complete
his
education
under
a
different
program
operation
bootstrap.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that
is
precisely
our
position,
this
might
have
been
a
different
case
had
habeas
corpus
been
brought
in
1968
although
i
would
still
say
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
issue
that
ought
to
be
under
taken
to
be
resolved
in
habeas
corpus.
it’s
crucially
important
that
the
habeas
corpus
power
be
protected
and
that
it
remain
fully
available
for
its
proper
purposes
but
is
equally
true
that
the
habeas
corpus
power
should
not
be
converted
into
a
means
of
general
review
of
intra-military
decisions
as
this
court
pointed
in
our
orloff
against
willoughby
that
and
i
quote,
“would
be
a
disruptive
force
as
to
affairs
peculiarly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
authorities.”
in
this
case,
sergeant
schlanger
was
admittedly
enlisted
for
a
period
of
six
years.
that
was
more
than
five
years
ago.
during
that
period,
he
has
received
a
college
education
and
nearly
all
of
which
was
at
public
expense
including
his
salary.
since
he
filed
this
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
he
has
been
on
leave
status
from
december
9,
1969
much
of
it
by
order
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
until
july
8,
1970
when
mr.
justice
black
refused
to
continue
his
leave
that
was
for
a
period
of
nearly
seven
months.
shortly
after
this
court
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari,
he
was
again
granted
various
periods
of
leave
and
finally,
he
was
granted
leave
on
december
25th
until
the
present
time
for
nearly
two
months.
thus
there
have
been
more
than
9
months
and
nearly
10
months
of
leave
connected
with
this
case.
sergeant
schlanger
was
ordered
to
iceland
in
january
and
as
i
have
indicated
that
was
deferred
at
the
request
to
my
office
until
after
the
hearing
today.
by
great
energy
and
persistence,
sergeant
schlanger
has
held
the
air
force
at
bay
for
nearly
nineteen
months.
it
may
be
that
this
is
not
within
the
legitimate
purpose
and
function
of
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
even
if
it
be
held
that
it
is
not
a
perquisite
to
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
that
there
would
be
someone
within
the
district
who
has
custody
of
the
petitioner,
it
is
still
our
contention
that
the
district
court
here
properly
held
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
this
petition.
habeas
corpus
petitions
are
not
avenues
to
advisory
opinions.
it
still
remains
a
constitutional
truism
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
only
over
cases
or
controversies.
a
case
or
controversy
requires
two
parties
both
of
whom
are
properly
before
the
court.
here
there
is
only
one
party
before
the
court
in
arizona
and
that
is
sergeant
schlanger.
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
colonel
homer
baker
are
the
only
persons
alleged
to
be
restraining
the
petitioner
of
his
liberty
and
neither
one
is
within
the
district
of
arizona.
district
courts
do
not
have
nationwide
jurisdiction
in
habeas
corpus
and
there
are
manifest
reasons
why
congress
has
never
provided
that
they
should
have
such
jurisdiction.
there
is
the
problem
of
transportation
and
there
is
the
problem
of
forum
shopping.
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
arizona
in
sergeant
schlanger’s
case,
then
any
serviceman
on
leave
can
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
any
court
he
chooses
by
simply
going
there
or
perhaps
by
filing
such
a
petition
by
mail
or
through
local
counsel.
that
seems
obviously
undesirable
and
in
no
senses
it
required
by
any
legitimate
concern
to
make
the
great
writ
available
when
it
is
needed.
there
is
of
course
section
1391
(e)
of
title
28
which
provides
for
nationwide
service
of
process
on
government
officers
in
civil
actions.
we
would
contend
first
the
section
1391
(e)
does
not
apply
to
habeas
corpus
that
it
was
not
intended
to
apply
the
habeas
corpus
and
need
not
be
found
to
apply
the
habeas
corpus
to
keep
that
writ
effective.
even
if
section
1391
(e)
does
apply
in
habeas
corpus
it
is
not
applicable
here
since
the
cause
of
action
did
not
arise
arizona
and
since
it
appears
clearly
on
the
face
of
the
petition
that
sergeant
schlanger
is
not
resident
in
arizona
that
is
domicile
there
which
is
the
proper
construction
of
that
word
in
the
statute
as
a
number
of
courts
have
held.
and
finally,
we
would
contend
that
even
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
arizona
this
a
case
which
should
be
transferred
to
the
middle
district
of
georgia
or
to
the
district
of
columbia.
sergeant
schlanger
suggests
that
the
witnesses
and
the
evidence
are
in
arizona
but
that
simply
highlights
the
fact
that
this
is
essentially
a
breach
of
contract
suit
not
a
habeas
corpus
matter
and
as
a
breach
of
contract
suit,
it
is
very
clear
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
in
arizona
under
this
petition.
unless
this
case
is
brought
to
a
conclusion,
it
is
obvious
that
there
will
be
endless
further
proceedings.
the
court
below
is
correct
in
holding
that
the
district
court
for
arizona
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
its
judgment
should
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
when?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
it
would
have
expired
in
19--
late
in
1971
except
that
there
is
provision
that
when
certain
types
of
permissive
leave
are
granted
such
as
that
for
which
he
went
to
the
university
of
arizona
in
1969
not
only
is
that
added
on
but
triple
is
added
on
so
that
i
understand
that
somewhat
more
than
a
year
still
remains
on
his
enlistment
but
i
do
not
know
the
exact
time
of
expiring.
