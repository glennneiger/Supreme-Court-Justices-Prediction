the
second
period
of
attendance
at
the
university
was
under
a
program
quite
different
from
the
first
one,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
operation
bootstrap?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
were
at
that
--
during
the
second
interval
you
were
therefore
in
a
different
status
in
a
military
point
of
view
aren’t
you
on
permissive
temporary
duty
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
while
one
directed
your
travel
and
the
other
permitted
your
travel,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
which
your
claim
on
the
merits
is
that
that
was
a
condition
of
your
reenlistment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
second
attendance
at
the
university
was
one
well,
operation
bootstrap
but
at
your
own
expense?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
schlanger?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
now
stationed
in
iceland
or
supposed
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
were,
let’s
assume
you
were
physically
now
in
iceland
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
wanted
to
bring
this
kind
habeas
corpus
action
where
under
your
theory
could
bring
it?
justice
potter
stewart
only
there
because
that’s
where
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
is?
justice
potter
stewart
or
you’d
be
appealing
the
effects
of
the
custody
in
iceland?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
no
u.s.
district
there?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
if
one
should
accept
your
theory
all
the
way
if
you
had
a
week’s
leave
you
could
just
look
around
with
any
one
of
the
50
states
and
fly
up
to
north
dakota
and
bring
your
habeas
corpus
action
up
there?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
international
shoe
contact
has
to
do
with
personal
service,
as
you
know.
justice
potter
stewart
what
test,
what
limits
would
you
put
on?
would
you
just
leave
it
on
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
say
he
should
at
least
be
able
to
file
his
habeas
corpus
action
in
a
place
where
he
lived
when
he
was
inducted,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
would
you
confront
it
to
the
district
with
the
most
significant
impacts
on
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
mean
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
examining
you
but
undoubtedly
you
thought
a
great
deal
more
about
this
case
than
we
have
so
far
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
degree
did
he
receive?
justice
potter
stewart
what
degree
did
he
receive?
justice
potter
stewart
bachelor
of
science
of
mathematics,
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
some
talk
that
we
have
been
supplied
with
something
with
respect
to
those
proceedings
and
i
don’t
seem
to
have
it
personally
perhaps
my
brothers
too.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
district
court’s
decision
had
been
to
deny
the
application
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies?
justice
potter
stewart
or
in
any
event
a
new
petition
could
be
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
or
not
and
now
that
he
is
in
iceland,
could
it
be?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
he
could
file
over
there
that
day,
couldn’t
he?
he
is
here.
he
is
here
in
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
question
is
not
before
us,
that’s
the
merits
of
his
habeas
corpus
action.
justice
potter
stewart
although
this
is
something
not
--
this
isn’t
a
question
that
you
pose
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
does
go
the
merits
of
his
application
for
habeas
corpus?
justice
potter
stewart
and
concerning
here
was
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
in
jurisdiction,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
when
does
the
petitioner’s
present
enlistment
expire?
justice
potter
stewart
some
time
this
year?
when
does
his
enlistment
expire,
some
times
in
this
year?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
what
the
solicitor
general
said
was
that
your
original
petition
if
it
remained
there
would
still
be
a
good
petition
even
though
you’ve
subsequently
been
moved.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
solicitor
general
did
not
suggest
that
it
was
all
that
clear
that
you
could
now
file
a
petition
in
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
either
--
and
you’ve
asked
in
the
alternative
either
they
make
you
an
officer
or
they
let
you
out.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don’t
want
money
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
i’ll
be
surprised
this
lawsuit
goes
you
don’t
want
money
damages.
justice
potter
stewart
you
want
either
to
be
commissioned
or
let
go.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
