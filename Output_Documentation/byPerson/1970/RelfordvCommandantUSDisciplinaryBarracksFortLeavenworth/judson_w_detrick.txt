mr.
judson
w.
detrick
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
in
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
this
court
granted
certiorari
limited
to
two
questions,
one
being
whether
the
facts
of
this
case
fall
within
the
scope
of
this
court’s
holding
in
o'callahan
v.
parker
that
crimes
committed
by
a
servicemen
within
the
united
states
and
in
times
of
peace
must
be
service
connected
if
the
military
courts
are
to
have
jurisdiction.
the
second
question
presented
is
the
retroactivity
of
o'callahan
v.
parker.
now,
o'callahan
v.
parker
involved
an
inquiry
by
this
court
under
the
extent
of
the
power
granted
by
a
congress
under
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
of
the
constitution
to
vest
the
courts
martial
with
the
jurisdiction
over
the
crimes
of
servicemen
committed
within
the
united
states
and
during
the
time
of
peace.
o'callahan
involved
the
crimes
of
assault
with
intent
to
rape,
attempted
rape
and
house
breaking.
crimes
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
no
mr.
chief
justice.
the
crime
was
committed
within
the
city
of
hawaii
--
honolulu,
hawaii,
i’m
sorry.
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
o'callahan,
was
off-duty,
out
of
uniform.
the
victim
of
the
crime
in
that
case
was
a
civilian,
totally
unrelated
to
the
military.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
crimes
involved
in
this
case
do
involve
crime;
they
are
two
rapes
and
kidnappings,
they
were
--
all
four
crimes
were
committed
on
a
military
reservation,
that
reservation
being
fort
dix,
new
jersey
with
the
exception
of
one
kidnapping
which
took
place
on
mcguire
air
force
base
which
is
directly
adjacent
to
fort
dix,
new
jersey.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
police
authorities
themselves?
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i
would
imagine
not.
it
probably
only
the
military
police
--
police
jurisdiction.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
catch
it.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
well,
if
the
question
is
whether
--
is
whether
for
instance
if
a
civilian
were
to
commit
a
crime
on
a
military
reservation,
he
is
not
subject
to
military
jurisdiction.
if
the
question
is
whether
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction
on
a
crime,
i
don’t
know
what
the
case
is
as
far
as
fort
dix,
new
jersey
is
concerned.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
it
may
well
be
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--federal.
nevertheless,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
means
that
the
military
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
it.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
in
this
case
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
is
not
involved.
there
are
military
reservations
in
the
united
states
where
the
state
might
well
be
involved
because
they
have
not
ceded
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
and
they
maintain
jurisdiction
over
those
military
reservations
in
situations
where
the
civilian
authorities
have
jurisdiction,
at
least
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
situation.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
i
think
he
would.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
reason
i
think
we
would
is
--
there
are
several
reasons
i
think
we
would.
number
one,
under
the
practical
situation
required
--
involved,
a
crime
committed
in
germany,
if
the
courts
martial
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
it,
he
would
of
practical
necessity
probably
be
tried
by
the
host
country’s
courts.
now,
in
any
event,
under
those
situations,
he
is
not
going
to
be
granted
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
in
a
civilian
court
of
the
united
states
and
i
think
that
the
exercise
of
military
jurisdiction
in
that
situation
may
well
be
an
exercise
within
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed,
whereas
if
it
were
committed
in
the
united
states,
i
feel
that
it
would
be
without
the
least
possible
power
even
though
committed
on
a
military
reservation.
i
will
point
out
that
as
the
court
already
has,
the
distinctions
between
the
o'callahan
case
and
this
case
are
the
facts
that
the
crime
was
committed
on
a
military
reservation
in
this
case
where
it
was
not
in
o'callahan
and
also
this
crime,
one
of
the
crimes
was
committed
against
the
military
dependent
in
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
member
of
the
armed
--
the
air
force
and
she
also
worked
at
a
post
exchange
restaurant,
i
believe
on
fort
dix.
i
would
submit
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
she
was
a
sister
of
a
soldier
and
was
visiting
the
walson
army
hospital
with
her
brother
on
the
day
she
was
kidnapped
and
subsequently
raped.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
in
the
military
courts,
he
received
a
sentence
of
death,
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances
and
reduction
to
the
lowest
enlisted
grade.
it
went
to
the
--
what
was
at
that
time
the
board
of
review
which
is
now
the
court
of
military
review
and
it
was
--
the
sentence
was
reduced
to
confinement
at
hard
labor
for
30
years,
dishonorable
discharge
and
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
think
it
would
either
that
that
factor
would
make
any
difference
at
all
your
honor
because
i
think
in
the
o'callahan
case,
this
court,
in
fact
looking
at
several
factors
--
what
we’ve
really
got
to
do
is
define,
arrive
at
a
definition
of
service
connection,
i
think.
i
think
this
court
looked
at
several
factors
in
o'callahan,
one
of
those
being
the
factor
that
courts
are
of
necessity
and
validly
so,
probably
instruments
of
discipline
as
well
as
justice.
secondly,
the
existence
of
specialized
military
courts
depends
upon
the
special
needs
in
military.
thirdly,
i
think
the
court
found
that
the
jurisdiction
of
military
courts
in
light
of
these
considerations
and
in
light
of
history
must
be
limited
to
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed,
the
end
proposed
being
the
maintenance
of
military
discipline
in
the
armed
forces.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
think
the
military
has
an
interest
in
the
security
of
the
military
base,
certainly.
i
think
with
respect
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i
think
the
military
has
significant
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
pardon
me?
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
doubt
if
they
can
unless
they
are
asked
to
function
on
that
post,
but
let
me
point
out
that
i
think
the
interest,
i
am
not
contesting
the
fact
that
the
military
does
have
an
interest
in
maintaining
law
and
order
on
a
post.
i’m
not
contesting
that
a
military
commander
has
the
authority
and
responsibility
as
the
respondent
points
out
to
maintain
law
and
order
on
a
military
installation.
i
do
contest
that
these
interest
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
military
must
be
able
to
try
and
punish
a
serviceman
who
commits
a
crime
on
a
military
installation
which
leads
to
disorder
or
lawlessness
on
the
military
installation.
i
don’t
think
that
that
conclusion
follows
the
reasoning
that
they
have
this
interest.
i
think
what
the
court
was
after
in
o'callahan
was
not
simply
an
interest
to
the
military
or
a
military
tie
but
a
necessity
on
the
part
of
a
military
to
have
jurisdiction
over
this
crime
if
the
maintenance
of
military
discipline
is
to
be
preserved,
a
necessity
that
they
exercise
jurisdiction
as
opposed
to
civilian
courts
exercising
jurisdiction.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
i
don’t
believe
the
conclusion
that
they
must
exercise
jurisdiction
follows
from
the
statement
that
they
have
an
interest
in
maintaining
law
and
order
on
a
military
reservation
is
simply
that
i
think,
the
civilian
courts
exercising
their
jurisdiction,
well,
adequately
served
the
interest
of
the
military
in
that
situation.
the
man
that
commits
a
crime
on
the
post,
a
serviceman
is
not
going
to
go
unpunished.
he
is
simply
going
to
be
punished
by
civilian
authorities
rather
than
military
authorities.
i
think
that
any
other
conclusion
takes
us
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed.
i
might
add
that
i
think
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
factor
of
military
dependency.
i
might
also
point
out
that
the
military,
court
of
military
appeals
basically
agrees
with
that
proposition
in
that
they
have
found
that
military
dependency
and
i
will
admit
it
as
military
dependency
by
itself
does
not
give
the
requisite
service
connection
to
the
crime.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
i
think
there
would
be
military
jurisdiction
involved
there
your
honor
because
i
think
there
is
a
military
crime
of
abandoning
your
post
while
on
duty
or
something
to
that
order
and
i’m
not
familiar
with
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
okay,
i’m
sorry.
i
don’t
think
--
let
me
back
up
now,
i
think
the
military
exercising
its
jurisdiction
over
that
military
crime
adequately
serves
the
military’s
interest.
i
don’t
think
that
that
gives
them
the
right
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
crimes
of
rape
committed
while
this
man
was
--
after
this
man
left
his
duty
position.
does
that
answer
your
question?
i
also
feel
that
the
use
of
military
installation
boundaries
can
lead
to
some
very
unusual
and
illogical
conclusions
if
it
is
used
by
itself
without
any
analysis
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
involved
and
the
interest
of
the
military
in
exercising
jurisdiction
over
that
crime.
i
think
the
court
of
military
appeals’
decisions
adequately
point
this
out.
now,
respondent
seeks
to
limit
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
on
a
military
reservation
to
those
crimes
which
affect
the
security
of
persons
and
property
on
a
military
reservation.
i
don’t
think
that
this
restriction
in
any
way
alters
the
illogical
results
that
will
be
arrived
at
through
the
use
only
of
a
military
installation
boundary
as
a
jurisdictional
line.
i
don’t
think
the
--
this
court
in
o'callahan
anticipated
that
either
because
i
think
they
--
this
placed
great
emphasis
on
an
analysis
of
the
crime
itself
in
its
effect
on
the
interest
of
the
military
organization.
if
i
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
he
was
on
evening
pass.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
he
was
on
evening
pass,
according
to
the
record
he
was
on
evening
pass
at
the
times
of
--
at
the
time
all
four
crimes
were
committed.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
and
out
of
uniform,
i’m
not
--
i
don’t
feel
that
these
are
of
any
importance
anyway.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
again
i
feel
that
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--
that
the
military
--
that
would
create
a
military
interest
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
crime,
the
military
crime.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
not
with
respect
to
the
crime
of
rape
and
kidnapping.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
no
you
did
not.
there
is
a
military
crime
involved,
but
i
don’t
believe
the
military
crime,
the
crime
the
military
would
have
jurisdiction
over
would
be
the
crime
of
rape
and
kidnapping.
it
would
be
the
crime
of
assaulting
a
superior
commissioned
officer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
in
terms
of
each
listing
of
its
crimes
but
i’m
sure
there
is
a
military
crime
involved.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
there
is
the
general
article,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
both
were
off-duty?
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
both
off-duty,
they
have
to
be
on
a
military
reservation,
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
civilian
authorities,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
depends
upon
the
particular
camp
involved.
some
as
i
understand
the
situation,
some
military
installations
are
on
land
that
jurisdiction
has
been
ceded
to
the
federal
government
over
by
the
state
--
that
or
they
existed
in
the
state
prior
to
the
state’s
existence.
in
those
situations,
the
federal
government
has
jurisdiction
and
as
if
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
general
interest
--
i’m
not
sure
that
this
--
to
be
--
the
preface
of
my
answer,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
jurisdiction.
it’s
either
to
say
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
or
the
federal
government,
i
don’t
think
that
effects
my
argument
but
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
whichever
happens
to
have
jurisdiction
over
that
installation.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
my
whole
point
is
that
the
--
either
a
state
or
the
federal
government,
a
civilian
jurisdiction
has
jurisdiction
not
the
military.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
distinction
in
--
within
the
context
of
the
reasoning
involved
in
the
o'callahan
decision
however.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
that
crime
was
committed
on
a
military
installation
increases
the
interest
of
the
military
in
trying
and
punishing
that
man.
it
certainly
doesn’t
raise
their
interest
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
police
interest
involved,
but
that
police
interest
is
adequately
met
by
the
apprehension
of
that
person
and
turning
him
over
to
the
civilian
authorities
whoever
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
mean
to
place
emphasis
on
that.
i’m
simply
trying
to
answer
the
questions.
i
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
there
is
no
military
interest
of
a
sort
that
requires
military
jurisdiction.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
we
have
found
--
thinking
of
guantanamo
bay
which
i
think
is
the
naval
base.
we
--
that
maybe
a
situation
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that
may
be
a
situation
closely
related
to
the
situation
of
a
military
base
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--
located
in
germany.
there
may
be
a
particular
military
interest
in
maintaining
jurisdiction
in
order
to
exercise
immediate
disciplinary
control
which
would
attach
in
that
situation
and
bring
it
with
–
bring
the
case
within
the
concept
of
a
least
possible
power.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
no.
my
interest
--
my
answer
there
was
that
i
think
military
jurisdiction
would
attach
because
of
the
fact
that
in
any
event
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
because
of
the
need
to
take
him
back
here,
the
practical
problems
of
taking
him
back,
the
status
of
forces,
treaty
agreements
which
give
the
host
countries
general
jurisdiction.
in
any
event,
if
the
military
doesn’t
exercise
jurisdiction,
he
is
not
going
to
get
his
trial
by
jury
in
a
civilian
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that’s
where
we
get
into
the
problem
of
who
has
jurisdiction
other
than
the
military
over
the
soil
of
fort
dix.
and
i
frankly
have
to
answer
your
honor
that
i
don’t
know.
i
know
that
as
a
fact,
the
federal
government,
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office
has
been
claiming
and
exercising
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
on
fort
dix
by
civilians
for
example
that
are
then
referred
to
the
civilian
authorities.
i
have
just
a
few
minutes
left,
i
think
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
second
question
provide
--
presented
by
this
court’s
grant
of
certiorari
and
that
is
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
o'callahan.
our
submission
is
of
--
the
relevant
facts
in
this
question
would
be,
o'callahan
was
convicted
in
1956.
his
military
conviction
became
final
in
1957.
this
court
handed
down
the
o'callahan
opinion
in
june
of
1969.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
1961
by
general
court
martial,
his
conviction
became
final
within
the
military
appellate
system
in
1963.
we
would
submit
your
honor
that
o'callahan
should
be
given
full
retroactive
effect
so
as
to
apply
not
--
so
as
to
apply
to
petitioner’s
conviction,
you
know
that
occurred
and
become
final
some
six
years
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
on
o'callahan.
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases,
but
significantly
in
linkletter
v.
walker
and
stovall
v.
denno
set
forth
three
criteria
to
be
used
--
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
thank
you.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
your
honor
i
wish
to
continue
at
this
time.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
question
raised
by
this
court’s
grant
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
o’callahan
v.
parker
and
it's
our
submission
that
o’callahan
v.
parker
is
precisely
the
kind
of
case
that
should
be
given
full
retroactive
application
so
as
to
apply
to
petitioner’s
conviction
even
though
it
became
final
within
the
military
appellate
system
some
six
years
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
o’callahan
v.
parker.
the
court
has
laid
down
a
series
of
three
criteria
for
determining
the
question
of
retroactivity
significantly
in
linkletter
v.
walker
and
stovall
v.
deno.
those
three
criteria
are
the
purposes
of
the
decision
in
question
the
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
on
this
standard
existing
prior
to
the
substantive
decision
and
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
of
the
retroactive
application.
now,
in
the
context
of
these
three
criteria
the
court
has
often
stated
that
the
crucial
question
is
whether
the
proscribed
activity
infects
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
i
would
submit
that
the
very
heart
of
the
court
martial
system
is
in
question
in
o’callahan
and
that
was
its
power
to
act.
i
think
that
the
integrity
of
the
process
by
which
o’callahan
and
petitioner
were
convicted
is
no
less
impugned
by
his
conviction
for
a
crime
that
the
court
had
no
power
to
try
and
convict
him
for
then
for
his
conviction
for
a
crime
he
did
not
commit
at
all.
in
both
cases,
the
defect
in
his
conviction
goes
to
the
very
center
of
the
legal
--
of
its
legal
justification.
now
i
think
the
court’s
emphasis
on
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
is
merely
and
often
articulated
aspect
of
its
general
concern
that
any
conviction
be
the
product
of
a
fundamentally
fair
proceeding.
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
necessarily
only
means,
it's
very
important
that
they
are
protecting
against
the
risk
of
the
conviction
of
the
innocent.
now
i
would
cite
the
court
to
its
case
in
the
witherspoon
v.
illinois
where
the
court
refused
to
find
that
the
jury
selection
standards
in
that
case
which
excluded
the
jurors
who
were
opposed
to
capital
punishment
from
the
jury.
the
court
refused
to
find
that
that’s
substantially
increased
the
risk
of
conviction
and
yet
the
court
--
conviction
of
the
innocent
and
yet
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
by
which
that
accused
was
convicted
was
necessarily
undermined
by
that
process.
and
the
court
went
on
to
give
witherspoon
v.
illinois
full
retroactive
application
despite
any
considerations
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
or
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct.
now
the
respondent
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that
is
correct.
respondent
submits
that
the
case
should
be
given
partial
retroactive
application
only
and
that
it
should
not
apply
to
convictions
that
became
final
within
the
military
appellate
system
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
o’callahan
which
was
june
2
of
1969.
in
part,
their
position
is
based
upon
this
court’s
decision
in
destefano
v.
woods.
in
destefano,
the
court
found
that
the
cases
of
duncan
v.
louisiana
and
bloom
v.
illinois,
which
imposed
the
jury
trial
requirements
on
the
states
should
not
be
given
retroactive
application
--
general
retroactive
application.
now
respondent
maintains
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
in
this
case
as
applied
in
that
case
i
submit
that
is
not
so.
first
of
all,
the
constitutional
provision
involved
in
this
case,
respondent
would
be
saying
the
sixth
amendment
should
not
be
determinative
of
the
question.
in
each
case
the
peculiarities
of
the
decision
and
substantive
decision
should
be
looked
at
closely.
now
i
feel
further
more
that
o’callahan
does
involve
more
than
destefano
involve
and
that
o’callahan
involves
a
determination
that
the
court
has
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
so
it
was
not
the
case
in
destefano
v.
woods.
such
a
determination
necessarily
as
i’ve
already
pointed
out
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
court
martial
process
itself
and
does
infect
the
integrity
of
fact-finding
process.
in
fact
despite
any
references
to
whether
the
court
martial
processes
at
whole
is
more
fair
or
less
fair
than
a
civilian
process.
i
would
submit
that
any
trial
and
conviction
of
someone
by
a
court
we
have
no
jurisdiction
or
the
subject
matter
is
unfair.
furthermore,
i
think
that
o’callahan
involve
more
and
simply
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
right
to
grand
jury
indictment.
i
think
o’callahan
involved
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
a
civilian
court
with
all
the
tenet
differences
between
civilian
courts
and
military
courts,
and
i
think
that
this
courts
opinion
in
o’callahan
points
that
fact
out.
now
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
well,
this
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
had
no
jurisdictional
of
the
crime
charged.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
feel
it
that
it
does,
your
honor.
if
that
would
be
my
position
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--
that
would
be
my
position.
respondent
also
places
great
emphasis
on
the
factors
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
and
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
so
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
often
held
that
when
the
purposes
of
a
decision
do
favor
it's
retroactive
application
which
i
would
submit
the
purpose
of
o’callahan
due
to
the
factors
of
reliance
and
at
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
are
not
significant
and
are
not
to
be
taken
into
consideration
because
only
when
the
purpose
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
it
favors
retroactivity
or
not
that
those
two
considerations
are
made.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
reliance
factor
on
the
o’callahan
is
certainly
not
as
strong
as
the
reliance
factor
existing
in
many
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
thank
you.
it’s
my
pleasure.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
in
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
this
court
granted
certiorari
limited
to
two
questions,
one
being
whether
the
facts
of
this
case
fall
within
the
scope
of
this
court’s
holding
in
o'callahan
v.
parker
that
crimes
committed
by
a
servicemen
within
the
united
states
and
in
times
of
peace
must
be
service
connected
if
the
military
courts
are
to
have
jurisdiction.
the
second
question
presented
is
the
retroactivity
of
o'callahan
v.
parker.
now,
o'callahan
v.
parker
involved
an
inquiry
by
this
court
under
the
extent
of
the
power
granted
by
a
congress
under
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
of
the
constitution
to
vest
the
courts
martial
with
the
jurisdiction
over
the
crimes
of
servicemen
committed
within
the
united
states
and
during
the
time
of
peace.
o'callahan
involved
the
crimes
of
assault
with
intent
to
rape,
attempted
rape
and
house
breaking.
crimes
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
no
mr.
chief
justice.
the
crime
was
committed
within
the
city
of
hawaii
--
honolulu,
hawaii,
i’m
sorry.
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
o'callahan,
was
off-duty,
out
of
uniform.
the
victim
of
the
crime
in
that
case
was
a
civilian,
totally
unrelated
to
the
military.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
crimes
involved
in
this
case
do
involve
crime;
they
are
two
rapes
and
kidnappings,
they
were
--
all
four
crimes
were
committed
on
a
military
reservation,
that
reservation
being
fort
dix,
new
jersey
with
the
exception
of
one
kidnapping
which
took
place
on
mcguire
air
force
base
which
is
directly
adjacent
to
fort
dix,
new
jersey.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
police
authorities
themselves?
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i
would
imagine
not.
it
probably
only
the
military
police
--
police
jurisdiction.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
catch
it.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
well,
if
the
question
is
whether
--
is
whether
for
instance
if
a
civilian
were
to
commit
a
crime
on
a
military
reservation,
he
is
not
subject
to
military
jurisdiction.
if
the
question
is
whether
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction
on
a
crime,
i
don’t
know
what
the
case
is
as
far
as
fort
dix,
new
jersey
is
concerned.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
it
may
well
be
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--federal.
nevertheless,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
means
that
the
military
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
it.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
in
this
case
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
is
not
involved.
there
are
military
reservations
in
the
united
states
where
the
state
might
well
be
involved
because
they
have
not
ceded
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
and
they
maintain
jurisdiction
over
those
military
reservations
in
situations
where
the
civilian
authorities
have
jurisdiction,
at
least
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
situation.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
i
think
he
would.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
reason
i
think
we
would
is
--
there
are
several
reasons
i
think
we
would.
number
one,
under
the
practical
situation
required
--
involved,
a
crime
committed
in
germany,
if
the
courts
martial
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
it,
he
would
of
practical
necessity
probably
be
tried
by
the
host
country’s
courts.
now,
in
any
event,
under
those
situations,
he
is
not
going
to
be
granted
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
in
a
civilian
court
of
the
united
states
and
i
think
that
the
exercise
of
military
jurisdiction
in
that
situation
may
well
be
an
exercise
within
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed,
whereas
if
it
were
committed
in
the
united
states,
i
feel
that
it
would
be
without
the
least
possible
power
even
though
committed
on
a
military
reservation.
i
will
point
out
that
as
the
court
already
has,
the
distinctions
between
the
o'callahan
case
and
this
case
are
the
facts
that
the
crime
was
committed
on
a
military
reservation
in
this
case
where
it
was
not
in
o'callahan
and
also
this
crime,
one
of
the
crimes
was
committed
against
the
military
dependent
in
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
member
of
the
armed
--
the
air
force
and
she
also
worked
at
a
post
exchange
restaurant,
i
believe
on
fort
dix.
i
would
submit
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
she
was
a
sister
of
a
soldier
and
was
visiting
the
walson
army
hospital
with
her
brother
on
the
day
she
was
kidnapped
and
subsequently
raped.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
in
the
military
courts,
he
received
a
sentence
of
death,
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances
and
reduction
to
the
lowest
enlisted
grade.
it
went
to
the
--
what
was
at
that
time
the
board
of
review
which
is
now
the
court
of
military
review
and
it
was
--
the
sentence
was
reduced
to
confinement
at
hard
labor
for
30
years,
dishonorable
discharge
and
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
think
it
would
either
that
that
factor
would
make
any
difference
at
all
your
honor
because
i
think
in
the
o'callahan
case,
this
court,
in
fact
looking
at
several
factors
--
what
we’ve
really
got
to
do
is
define,
arrive
at
a
definition
of
service
connection,
i
think.
i
think
this
court
looked
at
several
factors
in
o'callahan,
one
of
those
being
the
factor
that
courts
are
of
necessity
and
validly
so,
probably
instruments
of
discipline
as
well
as
justice.
secondly,
the
existence
of
specialized
military
courts
depends
upon
the
special
needs
in
military.
thirdly,
i
think
the
court
found
that
the
jurisdiction
of
military
courts
in
light
of
these
considerations
and
in
light
of
history
must
be
limited
to
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed,
the
end
proposed
being
the
maintenance
of
military
discipline
in
the
armed
forces.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
think
the
military
has
an
interest
in
the
security
of
the
military
base,
certainly.
i
think
with
respect
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i
think
the
military
has
significant
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
pardon
me?
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
doubt
if
they
can
unless
they
are
asked
to
function
on
that
post,
but
let
me
point
out
that
i
think
the
interest,
i
am
not
contesting
the
fact
that
the
military
does
have
an
interest
in
maintaining
law
and
order
on
a
post.
i’m
not
contesting
that
a
military
commander
has
the
authority
and
responsibility
as
the
respondent
points
out
to
maintain
law
and
order
on
a
military
installation.
i
do
contest
that
these
interest
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
military
must
be
able
to
try
and
punish
a
serviceman
who
commits
a
crime
on
a
military
installation
which
leads
to
disorder
or
lawlessness
on
the
military
installation.
i
don’t
think
that
that
conclusion
follows
the
reasoning
that
they
have
this
interest.
i
think
what
the
court
was
after
in
o'callahan
was
not
simply
an
interest
to
the
military
or
a
military
tie
but
a
necessity
on
the
part
of
a
military
to
have
jurisdiction
over
this
crime
if
the
maintenance
of
military
discipline
is
to
be
preserved,
a
necessity
that
they
exercise
jurisdiction
as
opposed
to
civilian
courts
exercising
jurisdiction.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
i
don’t
believe
the
conclusion
that
they
must
exercise
jurisdiction
follows
from
the
statement
that
they
have
an
interest
in
maintaining
law
and
order
on
a
military
reservation
is
simply
that
i
think,
the
civilian
courts
exercising
their
jurisdiction,
well,
adequately
served
the
interest
of
the
military
in
that
situation.
the
man
that
commits
a
crime
on
the
post,
a
serviceman
is
not
going
to
go
unpunished.
he
is
simply
going
to
be
punished
by
civilian
authorities
rather
than
military
authorities.
i
think
that
any
other
conclusion
takes
us
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed.
i
might
add
that
i
think
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
factor
of
military
dependency.
i
might
also
point
out
that
the
military,
court
of
military
appeals
basically
agrees
with
that
proposition
in
that
they
have
found
that
military
dependency
and
i
will
admit
it
as
military
dependency
by
itself
does
not
give
the
requisite
service
connection
to
the
crime.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
i
think
there
would
be
military
jurisdiction
involved
there
your
honor
because
i
think
there
is
a
military
crime
of
abandoning
your
post
while
on
duty
or
something
to
that
order
and
i’m
not
familiar
with
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
okay,
i’m
sorry.
i
don’t
think
--
let
me
back
up
now,
i
think
the
military
exercising
its
jurisdiction
over
that
military
crime
adequately
serves
the
military’s
interest.
i
don’t
think
that
that
gives
them
the
right
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
crimes
of
rape
committed
while
this
man
was
--
after
this
man
left
his
duty
position.
does
that
answer
your
question?
i
also
feel
that
the
use
of
military
installation
boundaries
can
lead
to
some
very
unusual
and
illogical
conclusions
if
it
is
used
by
itself
without
any
analysis
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
involved
and
the
interest
of
the
military
in
exercising
jurisdiction
over
that
crime.
i
think
the
court
of
military
appeals’
decisions
adequately
point
this
out.
now,
respondent
seeks
to
limit
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
on
a
military
reservation
to
those
crimes
which
affect
the
security
of
persons
and
property
on
a
military
reservation.
i
don’t
think
that
this
restriction
in
any
way
alters
the
illogical
results
that
will
be
arrived
at
through
the
use
only
of
a
military
installation
boundary
as
a
jurisdictional
line.
i
don’t
think
the
--
this
court
in
o'callahan
anticipated
that
either
because
i
think
they
--
this
placed
great
emphasis
on
an
analysis
of
the
crime
itself
in
its
effect
on
the
interest
of
the
military
organization.
if
i
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
he
was
on
evening
pass.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
he
was
on
evening
pass,
according
to
the
record
he
was
on
evening
pass
at
the
times
of
--
at
the
time
all
four
crimes
were
committed.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
and
out
of
uniform,
i’m
not
--
i
don’t
feel
that
these
are
of
any
importance
anyway.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
again
i
feel
that
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--
that
the
military
--
that
would
create
a
military
interest
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
crime,
the
military
crime.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
not
with
respect
to
the
crime
of
rape
and
kidnapping.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
no
you
did
not.
there
is
a
military
crime
involved,
but
i
don’t
believe
the
military
crime,
the
crime
the
military
would
have
jurisdiction
over
would
be
the
crime
of
rape
and
kidnapping.
it
would
be
the
crime
of
assaulting
a
superior
commissioned
officer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
in
terms
of
each
listing
of
its
crimes
but
i’m
sure
there
is
a
military
crime
involved.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
there
is
the
general
article,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
both
were
off-duty?
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
both
off-duty,
they
have
to
be
on
a
military
reservation,
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
civilian
authorities,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
depends
upon
the
particular
camp
involved.
some
as
i
understand
the
situation,
some
military
installations
are
on
land
that
jurisdiction
has
been
ceded
to
the
federal
government
over
by
the
state
--
that
or
they
existed
in
the
state
prior
to
the
state’s
existence.
in
those
situations,
the
federal
government
has
jurisdiction
and
as
if
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
the
general
interest
--
i’m
not
sure
that
this
--
to
be
--
the
preface
of
my
answer,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
jurisdiction.
it’s
either
to
say
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
or
the
federal
government,
i
don’t
think
that
effects
my
argument
but
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
whichever
happens
to
have
jurisdiction
over
that
installation.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
my
whole
point
is
that
the
--
either
a
state
or
the
federal
government,
a
civilian
jurisdiction
has
jurisdiction
not
the
military.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
distinction
in
--
within
the
context
of
the
reasoning
involved
in
the
o'callahan
decision
however.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
that
crime
was
committed
on
a
military
installation
increases
the
interest
of
the
military
in
trying
and
punishing
that
man.
it
certainly
doesn’t
raise
their
interest
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
police
interest
involved,
but
that
police
interest
is
adequately
met
by
the
apprehension
of
that
person
and
turning
him
over
to
the
civilian
authorities
whoever
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
mean
to
place
emphasis
on
that.
i’m
simply
trying
to
answer
the
questions.
i
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
there
is
no
military
interest
of
a
sort
that
requires
military
jurisdiction.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes.
we
have
found
--
thinking
of
guantanamo
bay
which
i
think
is
the
naval
base.
we
--
that
maybe
a
situation
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that
may
be
a
situation
closely
related
to
the
situation
of
a
military
base
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--
located
in
germany.
there
may
be
a
particular
military
interest
in
maintaining
jurisdiction
in
order
to
exercise
immediate
disciplinary
control
which
would
attach
in
that
situation
and
bring
it
with
–
bring
the
case
within
the
concept
of
a
least
possible
power.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
no.
my
interest
--
my
answer
there
was
that
i
think
military
jurisdiction
would
attach
because
of
the
fact
that
in
any
event
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
because
of
the
need
to
take
him
back
here,
the
practical
problems
of
taking
him
back,
the
status
of
forces,
treaty
agreements
which
give
the
host
countries
general
jurisdiction.
in
any
event,
if
the
military
doesn’t
exercise
jurisdiction,
he
is
not
going
to
get
his
trial
by
jury
in
a
civilian
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that’s
where
we
get
into
the
problem
of
who
has
jurisdiction
other
than
the
military
over
the
soil
of
fort
dix.
and
i
frankly
have
to
answer
your
honor
that
i
don’t
know.
i
know
that
as
a
fact,
the
federal
government,
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office
has
been
claiming
and
exercising
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
on
fort
dix
by
civilians
for
example
that
are
then
referred
to
the
civilian
authorities.
i
have
just
a
few
minutes
left,
i
think
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
second
question
provide
--
presented
by
this
court’s
grant
of
certiorari
and
that
is
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
o'callahan.
our
submission
is
of
--
the
relevant
facts
in
this
question
would
be,
o'callahan
was
convicted
in
1956.
his
military
conviction
became
final
in
1957.
this
court
handed
down
the
o'callahan
opinion
in
june
of
1969.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
1961
by
general
court
martial,
his
conviction
became
final
within
the
military
appellate
system
in
1963.
we
would
submit
your
honor
that
o'callahan
should
be
given
full
retroactive
effect
so
as
to
apply
not
--
so
as
to
apply
to
petitioner’s
conviction,
you
know
that
occurred
and
become
final
some
six
years
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
on
o'callahan.
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases,
but
significantly
in
linkletter
v.
walker
and
stovall
v.
denno
set
forth
three
criteria
to
be
used
--
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
thank
you.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
your
honor
i
wish
to
continue
at
this
time.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
question
raised
by
this
court’s
grant
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
o’callahan
v.
parker
and
it's
our
submission
that
o’callahan
v.
parker
is
precisely
the
kind
of
case
that
should
be
given
full
retroactive
application
so
as
to
apply
to
petitioner’s
conviction
even
though
it
became
final
within
the
military
appellate
system
some
six
years
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
o’callahan
v.
parker.
the
court
has
laid
down
a
series
of
three
criteria
for
determining
the
question
of
retroactivity
significantly
in
linkletter
v.
walker
and
stovall
v.
deno.
those
three
criteria
are
the
purposes
of
the
decision
in
question
the
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
on
this
standard
existing
prior
to
the
substantive
decision
and
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
of
the
retroactive
application.
now,
in
the
context
of
these
three
criteria
the
court
has
often
stated
that
the
crucial
question
is
whether
the
proscribed
activity
infects
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
i
would
submit
that
the
very
heart
of
the
court
martial
system
is
in
question
in
o’callahan
and
that
was
its
power
to
act.
i
think
that
the
integrity
of
the
process
by
which
o’callahan
and
petitioner
were
convicted
is
no
less
impugned
by
his
conviction
for
a
crime
that
the
court
had
no
power
to
try
and
convict
him
for
then
for
his
conviction
for
a
crime
he
did
not
commit
at
all.
in
both
cases,
the
defect
in
his
conviction
goes
to
the
very
center
of
the
legal
--
of
its
legal
justification.
now
i
think
the
court’s
emphasis
on
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
is
merely
and
often
articulated
aspect
of
its
general
concern
that
any
conviction
be
the
product
of
a
fundamentally
fair
proceeding.
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
necessarily
only
means,
it's
very
important
that
they
are
protecting
against
the
risk
of
the
conviction
of
the
innocent.
now
i
would
cite
the
court
to
its
case
in
the
witherspoon
v.
illinois
where
the
court
refused
to
find
that
the
jury
selection
standards
in
that
case
which
excluded
the
jurors
who
were
opposed
to
capital
punishment
from
the
jury.
the
court
refused
to
find
that
that’s
substantially
increased
the
risk
of
conviction
and
yet
the
court
--
conviction
of
the
innocent
and
yet
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
by
which
that
accused
was
convicted
was
necessarily
undermined
by
that
process.
and
the
court
went
on
to
give
witherspoon
v.
illinois
full
retroactive
application
despite
any
considerations
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
or
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct.
now
the
respondent
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
that
is
correct.
respondent
submits
that
the
case
should
be
given
partial
retroactive
application
only
and
that
it
should
not
apply
to
convictions
that
became
final
within
the
military
appellate
system
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
o’callahan
which
was
june
2
of
1969.
in
part,
their
position
is
based
upon
this
court’s
decision
in
destefano
v.
woods.
in
destefano,
the
court
found
that
the
cases
of
duncan
v.
louisiana
and
bloom
v.
illinois,
which
imposed
the
jury
trial
requirements
on
the
states
should
not
be
given
retroactive
application
--
general
retroactive
application.
now
respondent
maintains
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
in
this
case
as
applied
in
that
case
i
submit
that
is
not
so.
first
of
all,
the
constitutional
provision
involved
in
this
case,
respondent
would
be
saying
the
sixth
amendment
should
not
be
determinative
of
the
question.
in
each
case
the
peculiarities
of
the
decision
and
substantive
decision
should
be
looked
at
closely.
now
i
feel
further
more
that
o’callahan
does
involve
more
than
destefano
involve
and
that
o’callahan
involves
a
determination
that
the
court
has
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
so
it
was
not
the
case
in
destefano
v.
woods.
such
a
determination
necessarily
as
i’ve
already
pointed
out
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
court
martial
process
itself
and
does
infect
the
integrity
of
fact-finding
process.
in
fact
despite
any
references
to
whether
the
court
martial
processes
at
whole
is
more
fair
or
less
fair
than
a
civilian
process.
i
would
submit
that
any
trial
and
conviction
of
someone
by
a
court
we
have
no
jurisdiction
or
the
subject
matter
is
unfair.
furthermore,
i
think
that
o’callahan
involve
more
and
simply
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
right
to
grand
jury
indictment.
i
think
o’callahan
involved
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
a
civilian
court
with
all
the
tenet
differences
between
civilian
courts
and
military
courts,
and
i
think
that
this
courts
opinion
in
o’callahan
points
that
fact
out.
now
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
well,
this
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
had
no
jurisdictional
of
the
crime
charged.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
i
don’t
feel
it
that
it
does,
your
honor.
if
that
would
be
my
position
--
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
--
that
would
be
my
position.
respondent
also
places
great
emphasis
on
the
factors
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
and
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice.
so
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
often
held
that
when
the
purposes
of
a
decision
do
favor
it's
retroactive
application
which
i
would
submit
the
purpose
of
o’callahan
due
to
the
factors
of
reliance
and
at
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
are
not
significant
and
are
not
to
be
taken
into
consideration
because
only
when
the
purpose
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
it
favors
retroactivity
or
not
that
those
two
considerations
are
made.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
reliance
factor
on
the
o’callahan
is
certainly
not
as
strong
as
the
reliance
factor
existing
in
many
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
judson
w.
detrick
thank
you.
it’s
my
pleasure.
