mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts
in
this
case.
it
involves
a
serviceman
who
is
stationed
at
fort
dix
who
was
off
duty
on
an
evening
past
and
not
in
uniform.
the
crimes
occurred
within
the
boundaries
of
a
military
reservation,
incidentally,
his
military
reservation
where
he
was
stationed.
the
victims
were
dependents
of
servicemen.
in
one
case,
the
14-year
old
sister
of
a
serviceman
who
was
visiting
his
wife
who
had
just
given
birth
to
a
child
in
the
army
hospital
at
fort
dix.
and
in
the
other
case,
the
wife
of
a
member
of
the
air
force
stationed
at
mc
guire
air
force
base
immediately
adjacent
to
fort
dix
and
employed
on
the
base.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice;
i
didn’t
know
that
it
had
got
into
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
he
was
assigned
to
fort
campbell.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
the
appropriate
hospital
apparently
was
at
fort
dix
and
that’s
where
his
wife
had
come.
these
were
crimes
of
violence
involving
kidnapping
and
rape.
rape
is
specifically
made
a
crime
under
article
120
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
kidnapping
was
--
the
charge
of
kidnapping
was
brought
under
the
so-called
general
article
--
article
134.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
all
of
the
events
.both
the
rape
and
the
kidnapping
occurred
on
the
military
reservation.
a
radical
change,
i
think
it
may
be
fairly
said,
was
introduced
in
this
law
in
this
area
by
this
court’s
decision
in
o’callahan
against
parker
decided
on
june
2,
1969.
that
decision
left
in
it's
wake
many
undecided
and
uncertain
questions
which
the
military
lawyers
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
have
been
working
hard
to
resolve
until
other
cases
can
be
brought
forward
like
this
one
for
guiding
light
from
this
court.
one
of
the
problems
of
course
the
retroactive
application
of
the
o’callahan
decision
to
which
i
will
turn
later
in
my
argument.
of
immediate
concern
however,
to
the
lawyers
who
are
responsible
for
the
administration
of
military
justice,
are
such
questions
as
these.
not
all
of
which
are
involved
in
this
case
but
i
want
to
list
them
as
some
of
the
problems
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
a
larger
setting.
in
the
first
place
the
standard
setup
in
the
o’callahan
case
is
service
connection.
what
is
service
connection?
is
it
enough
if
in
this
country
the
offense
occurs
on
a
military
reservation
and
is
committed
by
a
serviceman?
does
that
apply
to
all
offenses
including
fraud,
bad
checks
and
so
on
or
only
the
crimes
of
violence?
and
if
so,
what
crimes
under
what
circumstances?
and
enlarging
somewhat
on
that,
is
there
any
way
that
there
can
be
a
sure
simple
test
or
standard
of
this
or
must
it
be
resolved
case
by
case
someway
trying
to
workout
the
fact
of
each
case
as
to
whether
there
is
enough
here
to
make
it
service
connected
or
not?
the
latter
of
course
obviously,
involving
great
difficulty
and
frequent
reconsideration
through
appeals
habeas
corpus
and
so
on.
can
a
court
martial
try
an
offense
which
occurs
off
a
military
reservation
in
any
case?
for
example,
an
assault
by
one
serviceman
on
another
in
a
non-public
--
in
a
public
non-military
place.
and
then
another
question
of
great
importance,
can
there
be
a
waiver
of
the
right
not
to
be
tried
by
court
martial?
for
example
the
serviceman
in
a
city,
near
his
base
in
a
southern
state
might
be
charged
with
an
offense
with
racial
overtones.
he
might
much
prefer
to
be
tried
by
court
martial
and
the
local
authorities
might
be
willing.
can
this
be
done
with
his
consent?
if
the
court
martial
has
no
jurisdiction,
it
may
be
hard
to
support
a
waiver
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
question
is
not
here.
i'm
trying
to
put
this
in
its
broader
context
or
suppose
that
a
navy
ship
coast
at
norfolk
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
will
get
to
the
narrow
facts
but
the
broad
problem
is
one
of
great
concern
and
the
form
of
this
court’s
opinion
can
be
of
considerable
significance
as
well
as
the
result
at
reach
--
it
reaches.
suppose
a
navy
ship
coast
at
norfolk
and
crew
was
given
shore
leave.
while
in
the
city,
one
of
the
men
gets
involved
in
a
drunken
brawl,
there
are
injuries
but
no
one
is
killed.
the
ship
is
under
orders
to
leave
the
next
morning.
the
city
authorities
will
turn
the
man
over
to
the
navy
if
the
navy
will
really
try
him
for
the
offense,
the
man
is
willing.
the
navy
needs
him
and
can
use
him
despite
the
charge.
he
may
have
an
important
assignment
on
the
crew.
can
the
navy
try
him
in
such
circumstances?
suppose
that
all
of
the
witnesses
are
likewise
members
of
the
same
crew
and
note
too
the
civilian
punishment
might
be
a
certain
number
of
months
in
jail
while
the
navy
can
be
much
more
flexible
with
such
punishments
as
reduction
in
grade,
extra
duty
or
weekends
in
the
brig
which
may
be
effective
in
many
cases
and
less
disruptive
of
the
military
service.
and
then
there's
the
whole
area
abroad,
can
there
be
a
court
martial
for
any
offense
committed
abroad
whether
on
or
off
a
military
reservation,
whether
against
military
personnel
or
civilians.
note
that
generally
speaking
no
question
or
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
involved
here.
in
certain
cases,
the
status
of
forces
treaties
are
in
effect
under
which
we
can
turn
the
man
over
to
the
foreign
authorities
but
suppose
there
is
no
such
treaty
or
the
foreign
authorities
do
not
want
to
try
the
man.
can
he
be
validly
tried
by
the
court
martial
against
his
objection?
the
alternatives
may
be
to
turn
also
such
offenders
to
the
local
authorities
which
may
mean
trial
by
an
alien
system
and
punishment
which
would
not
meet
with
approval
here.
all
of
these
questions
and
more
have
been
left
in
uncertainty
since
the
o’callahan
decision.
this
court’s
guidance
is
needed.
the
problems
arise
not
only
in
the
matters
of
current
trials
for
offenses
committed
after
the
o’callahan
decision
and
in
habeas
corpus
with
respect
to
past
convictions
but
also
in
suits
for
various
collateral
remedies.
such
as
back
pay
restoration,
to
arraign,
correction
of
military
records,
and
so
on.
it
is
a
very
complicated
area
filled
with
many
difficulties
in
both
past
and
prospective.
and
now
let
me
turn
to
the
particular
problem
presented
by
this
case.
there
are
as
far
as
i
know
only
two
constitutional
provisions
which
shed
any
light
on
this
problem
other
than
the
provisions
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
the
extent
that
they
are
not
made
inapplicable.
these
two
constitutional
provisions
are
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
and
the
except
clause
in
the
fifth
amendment.
the
first
of
this
express
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
that
was
pretty
much
read
out
of
this
area
in
the
cases
reid
and
covert
in
the
later
cases
and
i
don’t
want
to
throw
away
anything
that
any
member
of
the
court
thinks
is
useful
to
our
side
but
i
don’t
particularly
rely
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
i
don’t
see
how
it
can
expand
the
field
within
which
clause
14
gives
power
although
it
can
certainly
affect
the
way
in
which
that
power
is
exercised.
clause
14
expressly
gives
to
congress
the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
and
it
is
of
course
as
much
a
part
of
constitution
as
are
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
and
the
second
excepts
“cases
arising
in
the
land
of
naval
forces”
from
the
grand
jury
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
showing
that
the
framers
of
the
fifth
amendment
two
years
after
the
constitution
went
into
effect
where
did
not
think
they
were
restricting
the
power
that
had
been
granted
by
clause
14.
the
whole
structure
of
military
justice
rests
on
this
and
it
was
this
provisions
which
the
court
construed
and
applied
in
the
o’callahan
decision.
they
are
obviously
quite
general
and
quite
a
lot
can
be
read
into
them
or
not.
obviously
o’callahan
read
less
into
them
than
have
previously
been
supposed
but
how
much
and
on
what
basis
and
principles
is
not
yet
wholly
clear.
since
june
2,
1969
a
considerable
number
of
cases
have
come
before
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
has
the
responsibility
in
the
first
instance
of
trying
to
work
these
matters
off.
these
decisions
are
summarized
on
pages
6
to
8
of
our
brief.
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
held
that
o’callahan
does
not
apply
to
petty
offenses.
that
court,
the
court
of
claims
and
several
district
courts
have
held
that
on
off
duty,
off
post
crime
committed
overseas
may
be
punished
by
court
martial
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
a
case
involving
that
question
last
term
and
again
in
another
case
this
term.
the
gallagher
case
number
392
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
on
october
13.
with
respect
to
serious
crimes
committed
within
the
united
states,
the
few
cases
we
know
of
have
applied
a
multi-factor
approach
that
does
not
permit
the
statement
the
rules
of
thumb.
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
massing
of
the
elements
approach
sometimes
followed
with
confusion
if
i
might
say
so.
in
some
modern
state
decisions
in
the
field
of
conflict
of
laws,
the
court
of
military
appeals
appears
to
have
developed
a
rule
that
crimes
committed
by
a
serviceman
on
post
are
without
more
sufficiently
service
connected
to
justify
court
martial.
with
respect
to
off
post
crimes,
that
court
considers
a
number
of
factors
case
by
case
including
the
military
status
or
relationship
of
the
victim
and
the
role
of
the
offenders
military
--
the
role
which
the
military
offenders
military
status
are
played
in
the
crime.
in
addition
to
the
cases
on
pages
6
to
8
of
our
brief
i
can
also
refer
to
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
november
9th,
zenor
against
vogt
which
involved
what
you
might
call
a
routine
assault
by
one
serviceman
on
another
serviceman.
they
have
both
been
to
the
club
on
the
base.
the
second
serviceman
had
danced
with
the
first
man
--
serviceman’s
girlfriend
in
a
way
that
the
first
man
didn’t
like.
there
was
a
challenge
and
later
still
on
the
base
there
was
an
assault.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
one
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
on
november
9th.
it
is
simply
a
case
of
an
assault
committed
on
base
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
there
should
be
no
injunction
against
the
conduct
of
a
court
martial
that
it
was
appropriate
for
court
martial
following
the
on-base
rationale.
it's
a
case
like
this
in
many
respects
except
that
both
parties
were
service
en
there
and
the
offense
here
is
more
serious.
the
various
aspects
of
this
case,
the
present
relford
case
which
are
in
sharp
contrast
with
o’callahan.
there
the
crime
occurred
in
a
civilian
community.
here
the
crimes
were
on
military
post.
there
the
victim
had
no
military
connection.
here
the
victim
had
military
ties.
one
is
a
minor
sister
of
a
serviceman
and
the
other
a
wife
of
a
serviceman.
the
result
we
urge
is
that
any
crime
by
a
serviceman
jeopardizing
the
security
of
persons
or
property
on
a
military
reservation,
particularly
when
it's
his
military
reservation
should
be
regarded
as
per
se
service
connected
because
of
the
basic
impact
such
crimes
have
on
a
military
mission.
whether
the
court
martial
jurisdiction
should
extend
beyond
that
to
off
post
crimes
or
to
non-physical
crimes
on
post
like
fraud
or
bad
checks
is
not
involved
in
this
case
and
need
not
be
decided
here.
the
rule
for
which
we
contend
is
implicit
in
the
o’callahan
opinion
itself.
the
petitioner
suggests
that
court
martial
jurisdiction
should
extend
only
to
cases
where
the
offender
has
violated
a
uniquely
military
standard
of
behavior
such
as
failing
to
salute
or
assaulting
an
officer.
but
the
constitutional
authority
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
surely
covers
more
than
the
authority
to
arrest
the
member
of
the
forces
who
jeopardizes
the
safety
and
security
of
this
post
and
turn
him
over
to
the
civilian
authorities
who
may
have
little
natural
interest
in
the
problem
for
prosecution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
some
figures
quoted
in
o’callahan
and
i
believe
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
they
aren’t
very
meaningful
until
they
are
broken
down
to
eliminate
awol
and
things
of
that
kind.
it
lies
in
my
mind
that
there
are
some
725
now
incarcerated
for
serious
what
might
be
called
criminal
offenses.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
there
are
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
some
millions
who
have
been
subjected
to
court
martial
trials
in
the
period
since
the
second
world
war.
the
number
would
be
relatively
smaller,
that
would
be
of
the
order
of
a
thousand
or
a
few
thousand
rather
than
the
25,000
if
you
include
petty
crimes
and
what
might
be
called
purely
military
offenses.
i
can
undertake
to
get
some
figures
on
this
and
submit
it
in
a
memorandum.
i'm
not
prepared
to
give
you
a
definitive
answer
now.
the
contention
which
we
urge
seems
to
have
been
recognized
in
the
o’callahan
opinion
which
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
crimes
there
were
not
committed
on
a
military
post
or
enclave
according
from
the
opinion
and
also
to
the
fact
that
the
crimes
there
did
not
affect
the
security
of
the
military
post.
there
is
surely
a
clear
military
interest
in
the
security
of
persons
having
business
on
a
military
post
from
physical
attack
by
servicemen
on
that
post.
the
commander
of
a
military
installation
clearly
has
the
responsibility
to
maintain
law
and
order
in
his
command.
and
he
should
have
the
authority
to
do
so
in
so
far
as
service
personnel
are
concerned.
a
post
cannot
be
segregated
into
military
and
non-military
areas
for
law
enforcement
purposes
nor
should
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
offender
is
technically
on
duty
or
in
or
out
of
uniform.
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
military
service
and
remains
on
post,
he
necessarily
remains
subject
to
such
elementary
regulation
by
his
commander.
this
is
particularly
true
where
the
victims
are
close
relatives
of
servicemen
as
they
are
here.
in
the
interest
of
clarity
we
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
the
fact
that
a
crime
committed
by
a
servicemen
against
person
or
property
occurred
on
a
military
reservation.
a
territorial
jurisdiction
test
which
is
traditional
in
our
criminal
law
is
alone
enough
to
warrant
court
martial
of
the
offender.
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
the
man
should
be
turned
over
to
the
civilian
authorities,
some
military
reservations
are
vast
and
remote
and
it's
not
clear
as
a
matter
of
the
allocation
of
governmental
responsibility
why
a
local
court
in
jury
perhaps
far
removed
should
be
expected
to
vindicate
the
military’s
disciplinary
problems
with
it's
own
personnel
in
it's
own
community.
but
more
fundamentally,
the
constitutional
grant
of
power
of
government
and
regulation
should
carry
with
them
the
power
to
punish
and
not
simply
the
power
to
arrest
and
accuse.
now
i
turn
to
the
other
question
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
it's
also
important
that
in
the
administration
of
military
justice
to
know
whether
the
o’callahan
decision
is
to
be
applied
retroactively
and
if
so
to
what
extent?
although
a
favorable
decision
on
the
either
question
would
dispose
of
this
case,
we
urge
the
court
to
decide
both
questions
in
order
that
the
many
people
having
responsibility
in
this
area,
military
personnel,
military
judges,
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
the
lower
federal
courts
may
have
appropriate
guidance
in
carrying
out
their
duties.
in
o’callahan,
statutory
provisions
going
directly
back
to
1916
and
indirectly
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
republic
where
held
unconstitutional.
this
has
required
the
revamping
of
military
justice
on
a
large
scale
and
it
is
meant
that
practice
is
long
followed
in
good
faith
can
no
longer
be
followed.
of
course,
the
decision
of
this
court
will
be
complied
within
the
future.
so
as
i
have
indicated
much
guidance
is
still
needed
but
things
that
were
done
in
the
past
in
good
faith
should
be
regarded
as
having
at
least
de
facto
validity.
we
submit
that
this
change
and
basic
court
martial
law
for
it
was
a
change
should
be
treated
as
prospective
only.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
it
has
been
raised
in
a
number
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
all
of
which
has
decided
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
tried
for
a
court
martial
trials.
it
was
the
first
time
that
this
question
had
ever
been
brought
to
this
court
although
in
a
number
of
the
previous
cases
certiorari
had
been
denied.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
had
not
been
mooted
at
this
level.
the
only
suggestion
i
think
was
in
an
article
published
in
1960
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
a
law
review
article
but
--
and
i
think
it's
also
appropriate
to
say
that
in
the
cases
which
held
that
non-military
persons
could
not
be
subjected
to
court
martial,
reid
and
covert,
and
kinsella
against
singleton
and
several
others.
there
--
even
with
the
benefit
of
the
hindsight
which
i
have
now
in
rereading
those
opinions,
i
can
find
no
suggestion
by
the
court
that
this
was
an
area
involving
servicemen
which
was
subject
to
reconsideration.
i
think
more
specifically
on
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
kinsella
against
singleton
361
u.s.
written
by
mr.
justice
clark
with
seven
members
of
the
court
concurring
in
that
decision.
he
said
on
pages
beginning
on
240
and
continuing
on
page
241
“the
test
for
jurisdiction
it
follows
is
one
of
status
namely
whether
the
accused
in
the
court
martial
proceeding
is
a
person
who
can
be
regarded
as
falling
within
the
term
land
and
naval
forces.”
and
i
think
that
was
the
last
authoritative
word
from
this
court
and
the
last
intimation
until
the
o’callahan
case
was
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
it
is
right
that
there
were
quite
a
considerable
practice
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
that
it
was
not
denied
that
the
states
have
the
power
to
try
depending
on
this
complicated
questions
about
the
title
and
ownership
of
the
military
reservations
which
are
very
confused
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
many
cases
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
all
i
am
asserting
is
that
where
it
does
involve
a
serviceman
and
is
on
the
base
that
he
should
be
subject
to
military
jurisdiction.
now
the
problems
of
retroactivity
are
now
before
this
court
in
other
cases
and
they
are
difficult.
in
closing
my
argument
on
this,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
–
a
pair
of
cases
which
are
not
cited
in
our
brief.
i
gave
mr.
detrick
a
memorandum
of
them
yesterday.
in
searching
for
guidance
in
this
area
and
one
of
the
things
which
i
read
was
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
bell
against
maryland
in
378
u.s.
the
problem
there
is
rather
different
from
here
but
it
is
one
of
the
few
places
where
there
is
some
discussion
of
what
happens
when
there’s
a
change
in
the
law.
and
in
a
footnote
in
that
opinion
there
is
cited
the
case
of
united
states
against
chambers
and
291
u.s.,
a
case
on
which
i
worked
many
years
ago
and
that
brought
back
recollections
to
me.
the
chambers
case
is
one
which
arose
out
of
the
repeal
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
and
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
1933
and
1934.
and
the
chambers
case
itself
simply
holds
that
pending
prosecutions
which
have
not
become
final
would
fall
with
the
repeal
of
the
eighteenth
amendment.
but
the
question
what
to
do
about
convictions
which
have
become
final
before
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
adopted
never
came
to
this
court.
it
was
decided
a
number
of
times
in
lower
courts
and
this
court
only
denied
certiorari
and
the
whole
inference,
the
whole
basis
of
assumption
in
the
chambers
opinion
recognized
in
the
ensuing
failure
to
take
up
any
cases
and
reach
a
different
result
was
that
when
the
eighteenth
amendment
was
repealed
that
had
no
effect
on
judgments
which
had
become
final.
now
i
recognize
that
this
is
a
different
forum
of
constitutional
change
than
was
that
involved
in
the
adoption
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
repealing
the
eighteenth
amendment.
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
the
form
is
this
is
a
case
of
constitutional
change.
a
well
understood
and
accepted
and
acted
upon
understanding
of
constitutional
power
under
which
these
prior
convictions
have
been
obtained
was
determined
in
o’callahan
to
be
no
longer
effective.
of
course
i
do
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
how
many
persons
are
now
being
held
if
for
none
purely
military
offenses
pursuant
to
judgments
which
became
final
before
june
2,
1969.
i
can
say
from
my
own
experience
that
there
have
been
fewer
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
relying
on
o’callahan
then
i
anticipated
that
there
would
be.
should
this
court
hold
that
it
is
retroactive,
i
would
anticipate
that
there
would
be
a
considerable
increase
in
the
numbers
such
of
the
petitions.
i
will
endeavor
to
see
if
i
can
get
any
figures
on
that
and
submit
them
with
respect
to
the
other
material
that
i
have
said
i
would
present.
and
so
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
can
be
affirmed
on
both
grounds
that
is,
that
there
was
court
martial
jurisdiction
here
and
that
o’callahan
should
not
be
given
a
retroactive
application
to
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts
in
this
case.
it
involves
a
serviceman
who
is
stationed
at
fort
dix
who
was
off
duty
on
an
evening
past
and
not
in
uniform.
the
crimes
occurred
within
the
boundaries
of
a
military
reservation,
incidentally,
his
military
reservation
where
he
was
stationed.
the
victims
were
dependents
of
servicemen.
in
one
case,
the
14-year
old
sister
of
a
serviceman
who
was
visiting
his
wife
who
had
just
given
birth
to
a
child
in
the
army
hospital
at
fort
dix.
and
in
the
other
case,
the
wife
of
a
member
of
the
air
force
stationed
at
mc
guire
air
force
base
immediately
adjacent
to
fort
dix
and
employed
on
the
base.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice;
i
didn’t
know
that
it
had
got
into
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
that
he
was
assigned
to
fort
campbell.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
the
appropriate
hospital
apparently
was
at
fort
dix
and
that’s
where
his
wife
had
come.
these
were
crimes
of
violence
involving
kidnapping
and
rape.
rape
is
specifically
made
a
crime
under
article
120
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
kidnapping
was
--
the
charge
of
kidnapping
was
brought
under
the
so-called
general
article
--
article
134.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
all
of
the
events
.both
the
rape
and
the
kidnapping
occurred
on
the
military
reservation.
a
radical
change,
i
think
it
may
be
fairly
said,
was
introduced
in
this
law
in
this
area
by
this
court’s
decision
in
o’callahan
against
parker
decided
on
june
2,
1969.
that
decision
left
in
it's
wake
many
undecided
and
uncertain
questions
which
the
military
lawyers
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
have
been
working
hard
to
resolve
until
other
cases
can
be
brought
forward
like
this
one
for
guiding
light
from
this
court.
one
of
the
problems
of
course
the
retroactive
application
of
the
o’callahan
decision
to
which
i
will
turn
later
in
my
argument.
of
immediate
concern
however,
to
the
lawyers
who
are
responsible
for
the
administration
of
military
justice,
are
such
questions
as
these.
not
all
of
which
are
involved
in
this
case
but
i
want
to
list
them
as
some
of
the
problems
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
a
larger
setting.
in
the
first
place
the
standard
setup
in
the
o’callahan
case
is
service
connection.
what
is
service
connection?
is
it
enough
if
in
this
country
the
offense
occurs
on
a
military
reservation
and
is
committed
by
a
serviceman?
does
that
apply
to
all
offenses
including
fraud,
bad
checks
and
so
on
or
only
the
crimes
of
violence?
and
if
so,
what
crimes
under
what
circumstances?
and
enlarging
somewhat
on
that,
is
there
any
way
that
there
can
be
a
sure
simple
test
or
standard
of
this
or
must
it
be
resolved
case
by
case
someway
trying
to
workout
the
fact
of
each
case
as
to
whether
there
is
enough
here
to
make
it
service
connected
or
not?
the
latter
of
course
obviously,
involving
great
difficulty
and
frequent
reconsideration
through
appeals
habeas
corpus
and
so
on.
can
a
court
martial
try
an
offense
which
occurs
off
a
military
reservation
in
any
case?
for
example,
an
assault
by
one
serviceman
on
another
in
a
non-public
--
in
a
public
non-military
place.
and
then
another
question
of
great
importance,
can
there
be
a
waiver
of
the
right
not
to
be
tried
by
court
martial?
for
example
the
serviceman
in
a
city,
near
his
base
in
a
southern
state
might
be
charged
with
an
offense
with
racial
overtones.
he
might
much
prefer
to
be
tried
by
court
martial
and
the
local
authorities
might
be
willing.
can
this
be
done
with
his
consent?
if
the
court
martial
has
no
jurisdiction,
it
may
be
hard
to
support
a
waiver
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
question
is
not
here.
i'm
trying
to
put
this
in
its
broader
context
or
suppose
that
a
navy
ship
coast
at
norfolk
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
will
get
to
the
narrow
facts
but
the
broad
problem
is
one
of
great
concern
and
the
form
of
this
court’s
opinion
can
be
of
considerable
significance
as
well
as
the
result
at
reach
--
it
reaches.
suppose
a
navy
ship
coast
at
norfolk
and
crew
was
given
shore
leave.
while
in
the
city,
one
of
the
men
gets
involved
in
a
drunken
brawl,
there
are
injuries
but
no
one
is
killed.
the
ship
is
under
orders
to
leave
the
next
morning.
the
city
authorities
will
turn
the
man
over
to
the
navy
if
the
navy
will
really
try
him
for
the
offense,
the
man
is
willing.
the
navy
needs
him
and
can
use
him
despite
the
charge.
he
may
have
an
important
assignment
on
the
crew.
can
the
navy
try
him
in
such
circumstances?
suppose
that
all
of
the
witnesses
are
likewise
members
of
the
same
crew
and
note
too
the
civilian
punishment
might
be
a
certain
number
of
months
in
jail
while
the
navy
can
be
much
more
flexible
with
such
punishments
as
reduction
in
grade,
extra
duty
or
weekends
in
the
brig
which
may
be
effective
in
many
cases
and
less
disruptive
of
the
military
service.
and
then
there's
the
whole
area
abroad,
can
there
be
a
court
martial
for
any
offense
committed
abroad
whether
on
or
off
a
military
reservation,
whether
against
military
personnel
or
civilians.
note
that
generally
speaking
no
question
or
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
involved
here.
in
certain
cases,
the
status
of
forces
treaties
are
in
effect
under
which
we
can
turn
the
man
over
to
the
foreign
authorities
but
suppose
there
is
no
such
treaty
or
the
foreign
authorities
do
not
want
to
try
the
man.
can
he
be
validly
tried
by
the
court
martial
against
his
objection?
the
alternatives
may
be
to
turn
also
such
offenders
to
the
local
authorities
which
may
mean
trial
by
an
alien
system
and
punishment
which
would
not
meet
with
approval
here.
all
of
these
questions
and
more
have
been
left
in
uncertainty
since
the
o’callahan
decision.
this
court’s
guidance
is
needed.
the
problems
arise
not
only
in
the
matters
of
current
trials
for
offenses
committed
after
the
o’callahan
decision
and
in
habeas
corpus
with
respect
to
past
convictions
but
also
in
suits
for
various
collateral
remedies.
such
as
back
pay
restoration,
to
arraign,
correction
of
military
records,
and
so
on.
it
is
a
very
complicated
area
filled
with
many
difficulties
in
both
past
and
prospective.
and
now
let
me
turn
to
the
particular
problem
presented
by
this
case.
there
are
as
far
as
i
know
only
two
constitutional
provisions
which
shed
any
light
on
this
problem
other
than
the
provisions
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
the
extent
that
they
are
not
made
inapplicable.
these
two
constitutional
provisions
are
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
and
the
except
clause
in
the
fifth
amendment.
the
first
of
this
express
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
but
that
was
pretty
much
read
out
of
this
area
in
the
cases
reid
and
covert
in
the
later
cases
and
i
don’t
want
to
throw
away
anything
that
any
member
of
the
court
thinks
is
useful
to
our
side
but
i
don’t
particularly
rely
on
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
i
don’t
see
how
it
can
expand
the
field
within
which
clause
14
gives
power
although
it
can
certainly
affect
the
way
in
which
that
power
is
exercised.
clause
14
expressly
gives
to
congress
the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
and
it
is
of
course
as
much
a
part
of
constitution
as
are
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
and
the
second
excepts
“cases
arising
in
the
land
of
naval
forces”
from
the
grand
jury
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
showing
that
the
framers
of
the
fifth
amendment
two
years
after
the
constitution
went
into
effect
where
did
not
think
they
were
restricting
the
power
that
had
been
granted
by
clause
14.
the
whole
structure
of
military
justice
rests
on
this
and
it
was
this
provisions
which
the
court
construed
and
applied
in
the
o’callahan
decision.
they
are
obviously
quite
general
and
quite
a
lot
can
be
read
into
them
or
not.
obviously
o’callahan
read
less
into
them
than
have
previously
been
supposed
but
how
much
and
on
what
basis
and
principles
is
not
yet
wholly
clear.
since
june
2,
1969
a
considerable
number
of
cases
have
come
before
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
has
the
responsibility
in
the
first
instance
of
trying
to
work
these
matters
off.
these
decisions
are
summarized
on
pages
6
to
8
of
our
brief.
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
held
that
o’callahan
does
not
apply
to
petty
offenses.
that
court,
the
court
of
claims
and
several
district
courts
have
held
that
on
off
duty,
off
post
crime
committed
overseas
may
be
punished
by
court
martial
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
a
case
involving
that
question
last
term
and
again
in
another
case
this
term.
the
gallagher
case
number
392
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
on
october
13.
with
respect
to
serious
crimes
committed
within
the
united
states,
the
few
cases
we
know
of
have
applied
a
multi-factor
approach
that
does
not
permit
the
statement
the
rules
of
thumb.
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
massing
of
the
elements
approach
sometimes
followed
with
confusion
if
i
might
say
so.
in
some
modern
state
decisions
in
the
field
of
conflict
of
laws,
the
court
of
military
appeals
appears
to
have
developed
a
rule
that
crimes
committed
by
a
serviceman
on
post
are
without
more
sufficiently
service
connected
to
justify
court
martial.
with
respect
to
off
post
crimes,
that
court
considers
a
number
of
factors
case
by
case
including
the
military
status
or
relationship
of
the
victim
and
the
role
of
the
offenders
military
--
the
role
which
the
military
offenders
military
status
are
played
in
the
crime.
in
addition
to
the
cases
on
pages
6
to
8
of
our
brief
i
can
also
refer
to
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
november
9th,
zenor
against
vogt
which
involved
what
you
might
call
a
routine
assault
by
one
serviceman
on
another
serviceman.
they
have
both
been
to
the
club
on
the
base.
the
second
serviceman
had
danced
with
the
first
man
--
serviceman’s
girlfriend
in
a
way
that
the
first
man
didn’t
like.
there
was
a
challenge
and
later
still
on
the
base
there
was
an
assault.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
is
one
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
on
november
9th.
it
is
simply
a
case
of
an
assault
committed
on
base
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
there
should
be
no
injunction
against
the
conduct
of
a
court
martial
that
it
was
appropriate
for
court
martial
following
the
on-base
rationale.
it's
a
case
like
this
in
many
respects
except
that
both
parties
were
service
en
there
and
the
offense
here
is
more
serious.
the
various
aspects
of
this
case,
the
present
relford
case
which
are
in
sharp
contrast
with
o’callahan.
there
the
crime
occurred
in
a
civilian
community.
here
the
crimes
were
on
military
post.
there
the
victim
had
no
military
connection.
here
the
victim
had
military
ties.
one
is
a
minor
sister
of
a
serviceman
and
the
other
a
wife
of
a
serviceman.
the
result
we
urge
is
that
any
crime
by
a
serviceman
jeopardizing
the
security
of
persons
or
property
on
a
military
reservation,
particularly
when
it's
his
military
reservation
should
be
regarded
as
per
se
service
connected
because
of
the
basic
impact
such
crimes
have
on
a
military
mission.
whether
the
court
martial
jurisdiction
should
extend
beyond
that
to
off
post
crimes
or
to
non-physical
crimes
on
post
like
fraud
or
bad
checks
is
not
involved
in
this
case
and
need
not
be
decided
here.
the
rule
for
which
we
contend
is
implicit
in
the
o’callahan
opinion
itself.
the
petitioner
suggests
that
court
martial
jurisdiction
should
extend
only
to
cases
where
the
offender
has
violated
a
uniquely
military
standard
of
behavior
such
as
failing
to
salute
or
assaulting
an
officer.
but
the
constitutional
authority
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
surely
covers
more
than
the
authority
to
arrest
the
member
of
the
forces
who
jeopardizes
the
safety
and
security
of
this
post
and
turn
him
over
to
the
civilian
authorities
who
may
have
little
natural
interest
in
the
problem
for
prosecution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
some
figures
quoted
in
o’callahan
and
i
believe
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
they
aren’t
very
meaningful
until
they
are
broken
down
to
eliminate
awol
and
things
of
that
kind.
it
lies
in
my
mind
that
there
are
some
725
now
incarcerated
for
serious
what
might
be
called
criminal
offenses.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
there
are
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
some
millions
who
have
been
subjected
to
court
martial
trials
in
the
period
since
the
second
world
war.
the
number
would
be
relatively
smaller,
that
would
be
of
the
order
of
a
thousand
or
a
few
thousand
rather
than
the
25,000
if
you
include
petty
crimes
and
what
might
be
called
purely
military
offenses.
i
can
undertake
to
get
some
figures
on
this
and
submit
it
in
a
memorandum.
i'm
not
prepared
to
give
you
a
definitive
answer
now.
the
contention
which
we
urge
seems
to
have
been
recognized
in
the
o’callahan
opinion
which
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
crimes
there
were
not
committed
on
a
military
post
or
enclave
according
from
the
opinion
and
also
to
the
fact
that
the
crimes
there
did
not
affect
the
security
of
the
military
post.
there
is
surely
a
clear
military
interest
in
the
security
of
persons
having
business
on
a
military
post
from
physical
attack
by
servicemen
on
that
post.
the
commander
of
a
military
installation
clearly
has
the
responsibility
to
maintain
law
and
order
in
his
command.
and
he
should
have
the
authority
to
do
so
in
so
far
as
service
personnel
are
concerned.
a
post
cannot
be
segregated
into
military
and
non-military
areas
for
law
enforcement
purposes
nor
should
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
offender
is
technically
on
duty
or
in
or
out
of
uniform.
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
military
service
and
remains
on
post,
he
necessarily
remains
subject
to
such
elementary
regulation
by
his
commander.
this
is
particularly
true
where
the
victims
are
close
relatives
of
servicemen
as
they
are
here.
in
the
interest
of
clarity
we
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
the
fact
that
a
crime
committed
by
a
servicemen
against
person
or
property
occurred
on
a
military
reservation.
a
territorial
jurisdiction
test
which
is
traditional
in
our
criminal
law
is
alone
enough
to
warrant
court
martial
of
the
offender.
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
the
man
should
be
turned
over
to
the
civilian
authorities,
some
military
reservations
are
vast
and
remote
and
it's
not
clear
as
a
matter
of
the
allocation
of
governmental
responsibility
why
a
local
court
in
jury
perhaps
far
removed
should
be
expected
to
vindicate
the
military’s
disciplinary
problems
with
it's
own
personnel
in
it's
own
community.
but
more
fundamentally,
the
constitutional
grant
of
power
of
government
and
regulation
should
carry
with
them
the
power
to
punish
and
not
simply
the
power
to
arrest
and
accuse.
now
i
turn
to
the
other
question
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
it's
also
important
that
in
the
administration
of
military
justice
to
know
whether
the
o’callahan
decision
is
to
be
applied
retroactively
and
if
so
to
what
extent?
although
a
favorable
decision
on
the
either
question
would
dispose
of
this
case,
we
urge
the
court
to
decide
both
questions
in
order
that
the
many
people
having
responsibility
in
this
area,
military
personnel,
military
judges,
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
the
lower
federal
courts
may
have
appropriate
guidance
in
carrying
out
their
duties.
in
o’callahan,
statutory
provisions
going
directly
back
to
1916
and
indirectly
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
republic
where
held
unconstitutional.
this
has
required
the
revamping
of
military
justice
on
a
large
scale
and
it
is
meant
that
practice
is
long
followed
in
good
faith
can
no
longer
be
followed.
of
course,
the
decision
of
this
court
will
be
complied
within
the
future.
so
as
i
have
indicated
much
guidance
is
still
needed
but
things
that
were
done
in
the
past
in
good
faith
should
be
regarded
as
having
at
least
de
facto
validity.
we
submit
that
this
change
and
basic
court
martial
law
for
it
was
a
change
should
be
treated
as
prospective
only.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
it
has
been
raised
in
a
number
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
all
of
which
has
decided
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
tried
for
a
court
martial
trials.
it
was
the
first
time
that
this
question
had
ever
been
brought
to
this
court
although
in
a
number
of
the
previous
cases
certiorari
had
been
denied.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
had
not
been
mooted
at
this
level.
the
only
suggestion
i
think
was
in
an
article
published
in
1960
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
a
law
review
article
but
--
and
i
think
it's
also
appropriate
to
say
that
in
the
cases
which
held
that
non-military
persons
could
not
be
subjected
to
court
martial,
reid
and
covert,
and
kinsella
against
singleton
and
several
others.
there
--
even
with
the
benefit
of
the
hindsight
which
i
have
now
in
rereading
those
opinions,
i
can
find
no
suggestion
by
the
court
that
this
was
an
area
involving
servicemen
which
was
subject
to
reconsideration.
i
think
more
specifically
on
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
kinsella
against
singleton
361
u.s.
written
by
mr.
justice
clark
with
seven
members
of
the
court
concurring
in
that
decision.
he
said
on
pages
beginning
on
240
and
continuing
on
page
241
“the
test
for
jurisdiction
it
follows
is
one
of
status
namely
whether
the
accused
in
the
court
martial
proceeding
is
a
person
who
can
be
regarded
as
falling
within
the
term
land
and
naval
forces.”
and
i
think
that
was
the
last
authoritative
word
from
this
court
and
the
last
intimation
until
the
o’callahan
case
was
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
it
is
right
that
there
were
quite
a
considerable
practice
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
that
it
was
not
denied
that
the
states
have
the
power
to
try
depending
on
this
complicated
questions
about
the
title
and
ownership
of
the
military
reservations
which
are
very
confused
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
many
cases
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
all
i
am
asserting
is
that
where
it
does
involve
a
serviceman
and
is
on
the
base
that
he
should
be
subject
to
military
jurisdiction.
now
the
problems
of
retroactivity
are
now
before
this
court
in
other
cases
and
they
are
difficult.
in
closing
my
argument
on
this,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
–
a
pair
of
cases
which
are
not
cited
in
our
brief.
i
gave
mr.
detrick
a
memorandum
of
them
yesterday.
in
searching
for
guidance
in
this
area
and
one
of
the
things
which
i
read
was
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
bell
against
maryland
in
378
u.s.
the
problem
there
is
rather
different
from
here
but
it
is
one
of
the
few
places
where
there
is
some
discussion
of
what
happens
when
there’s
a
change
in
the
law.
and
in
a
footnote
in
that
opinion
there
is
cited
the
case
of
united
states
against
chambers
and
291
u.s.,
a
case
on
which
i
worked
many
years
ago
and
that
brought
back
recollections
to
me.
the
chambers
case
is
one
which
arose
out
of
the
repeal
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
and
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
1933
and
1934.
and
the
chambers
case
itself
simply
holds
that
pending
prosecutions
which
have
not
become
final
would
fall
with
the
repeal
of
the
eighteenth
amendment.
but
the
question
what
to
do
about
convictions
which
have
become
final
before
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
adopted
never
came
to
this
court.
it
was
decided
a
number
of
times
in
lower
courts
and
this
court
only
denied
certiorari
and
the
whole
inference,
the
whole
basis
of
assumption
in
the
chambers
opinion
recognized
in
the
ensuing
failure
to
take
up
any
cases
and
reach
a
different
result
was
that
when
the
eighteenth
amendment
was
repealed
that
had
no
effect
on
judgments
which
had
become
final.
now
i
recognize
that
this
is
a
different
forum
of
constitutional
change
than
was
that
involved
in
the
adoption
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
repealing
the
eighteenth
amendment.
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
the
form
is
this
is
a
case
of
constitutional
change.
a
well
understood
and
accepted
and
acted
upon
understanding
of
constitutional
power
under
which
these
prior
convictions
have
been
obtained
was
determined
in
o’callahan
to
be
no
longer
effective.
of
course
i
do
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
how
many
persons
are
now
being
held
if
for
none
purely
military
offenses
pursuant
to
judgments
which
became
final
before
june
2,
1969.
i
can
say
from
my
own
experience
that
there
have
been
fewer
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
relying
on
o’callahan
then
i
anticipated
that
there
would
be.
should
this
court
hold
that
it
is
retroactive,
i
would
anticipate
that
there
would
be
a
considerable
increase
in
the
numbers
such
of
the
petitions.
i
will
endeavor
to
see
if
i
can
get
any
figures
on
that
and
submit
them
with
respect
to
the
other
material
that
i
have
said
i
would
present.
and
so
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
can
be
affirmed
on
both
grounds
that
is,
that
there
was
court
martial
jurisdiction
here
and
that
o’callahan
should
not
be
given
a
retroactive
application
to
this
case.
