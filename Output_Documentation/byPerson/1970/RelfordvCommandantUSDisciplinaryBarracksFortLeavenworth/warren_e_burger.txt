chief

e.

we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
98,
relford
against
the
commandant.
mr.
detrick
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
on
--
was
o'callahan
on
a
military
reservation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
military
reservation
factor
has
any
relevance
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
civilian
authorities
have
any
jurisdiction
on
the
base,
civilian
police
authorities
to
start
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he’d
been
in
uniform
at
the
time,
would
that
make
any
difference
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
security
of
a
military
base,
isn’t
that
part
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
nay
other
--
is
there
any
other
power
to
establish
or
enforce
or
maintain
security
on
the
base
other
than
the
military?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
civilian
police
can’t
function
there,
can
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
civilian,
police
from
the
nearby
states,
government,
can’t
function
there,
can
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
try
to
test
your
--
the
scope
of
your
concept
of
interest.
suppose
he
was
on
--
the
petitioner
here
was
on
sentry
duty
that
night,
abandoned
his
post,
and
then
engaged
in
all
these
activities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
not
speaking
of
that
crime,
obviously
that
would
be
subject
to
military
jurisdiction.
i’m
talking
about
the
crimes
that
we’re
dealing
with
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
puzzled
by
your
emphasis
on
the
underlying
ownership
of
the
real
estates.
what
if
this
crime
had
happened
on
the
--
whatever
end
of
cuba,
we
have
a
naval
base,
no
state
has
any
interest
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
seem
to
put
quite
a
bit
on
when
you
emphasized
at
the
outset
he
was
on
an
evening
pass
and
in
civilian
clothes
and
yet
you
come
to
the
conclusion
in
response
to
questions
that
if
it
were
high
noon
and
he
were
on
duty
in
the
office,
as
a
clerk
typist
or
a
sentry,
it
would
make
no
difference.
you
simply
say
there’s
no
federal,
no
military
authority
here,
if
i
get
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
what
about
the
situation
on
our
base
in
cuba?
we
have
a
naval
base
of
some
kind
on
--
one
end
of
cuba.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
military
jurisdiction
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
germany?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
was
your
answer
on
germany?
we
turn
him
over
to
the
german
authorities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
civilian
jurisdiction
would
have
taken
over
in
this
case
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
take
that
up
in
the
morning
and
you’ll
have
8
minutes
remaining
in
total.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
continue
detrick
or
do
you
wish
to
reserve
for
rebuttal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
your,
your
position
really
is
isn’t
it
that
this
is
just
as
though
he
were
convicted
in
the
royal
courts
of
justice
in
london.
they
have
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
there’s
no
jurisdiction
in
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn’t
it
make
any
difference
whether
one
trial
is
better
than
the
other
or
not,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you’re
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
solicitor
general.
