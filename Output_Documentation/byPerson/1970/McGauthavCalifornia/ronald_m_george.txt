mr.
ronald
m.
george
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
on
direct
review
from
the
california
supreme
court
involves
the
single
issue
whether
petitioner
was
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
procedure
under
which
the
jury
was
entrusted
with
the
decision
whether
he
should
be
punished
alternatively
with
death
or
life
imprisonment
and
the
resolution
of
this
issue
will
affect
the
sentences
of
each
of
the
over
550
prisoners
in
the
nation
under
sentence
of
death.
the
procedure
which
is
involved
in
petitioner’s
case
under
california
law
provided
that
after
the
jury
found
petitioner
guilty
of
first-degree
murder,
additional
evidence
and
argument
on
the
issue
of
punishment
was
received
and
the
jury
return
of
penalty
verdict
after
being
instructed
as
follows.
first
of
all
that
the
proper
factors
to
consider
in
guiding
its
discretion
in
fixing
the
punishment
were
so
and
so
i’ll
get
into
those
and
more
detail
but
they
were
instructed
as
to
certain
factors.
i’ll
mention
in
summary
form
these
factors
included
all
the
evidence
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime
of
each
defendant’s
background
and
history
and
of
the
facts
and
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
penalty.
the
jury
was
further
instructed
to
base
its
decision
on
the
evidence
received
in
court.
the
jury
was
instructed
as
to
the
necessity
of
not
being
arbitrary
or
governed
by
mere
conjecture,
prejudice
or
public
opinion.
however,
and
if
anything
these
tips
the
scales
in
the
defendant’s
direction,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
could
be
influenced
by
pity,
mere
sentiment,
or
sympathy
for
the
defendant.
thus,
the
question
at
bar
is
not
whether
it
is
constitutional
to
submit
the
jury
of
penalty
in
a
capital
case
to
a
jury
without
any
standards.
the
question
properly
before
this
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
standards
which
are
provided
by
california
are
constitutionally
adequate.
i
might
mention
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan’s
question
that
there
are
indeed
two
offenses
that
i’m
aware
of
under
california
law
which
provide
for
the
jury
to
fix
the
punishment.
those
happened
to
be
penal
code
section
193,
vehicular
manslaughter
and
section
264,
statutory
rape.
now
i’d
like
to
give
a
very
brief
outline
of
the
factual
situation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
statutory
rape,
i
believe
it
is
one
to
fifty
years.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
fifty
(50),
yes.
and
in
vehicular
manslaughter,
it’s
lesser
range.
there
is
a
choice
in
some
offenses
i
would
just
guess
about
three
or
four
that
the
jury
is
entrusted
with
whether
to
send
the
defendant
to
state
prison
or
instead
to
county
jail
and
then
in
those
situations
specified
terms
are
provided
by
statute.
now,
outlining
briefly
the
factual
context
of
this
case
because
i
think
it’s
very
important
to
approach
this
case
is
a
living
reality
and
not
as
a
in
a
factual
vacuum
not
a
metaphysical
exercise
here
but
we’re
dealing
with
the
rights
of
one
individual
and
specific
facts
here.
the
offense
itself,
well,
the
victim
was
the
owner
of
a
little
market
which
he
and
his
wife
operated.
the
death
of
the
victim
occurred
during
a
holdup
committed
by
petitioner
and
his
co-defendant
mr.
wilkinson.
petitioner
was
41
years
of
age.
wilkinson
was
25.
this
was
an
unnecessary
cold-blooded
execution
of
mr.
smetana
the
owner.
he
offered
no
threat,
he
was
unarmed.
he
didn’t
attempt
to
obtain
a
weapon.
he
was
five
foot,
three
inches
tall,
a
hundred
and
thirty-five
pounds,
52
years
of
age.
he
could
have
been
robbed
without
a
weapon.
there
was
certainly
no
reason
to
kill
this
man.
petitioner
--
there’s
evidence
showing
that
he
told
and
mrs.
dupree
later
on
that
he
was
the
one
who
had
killed
mr.
smetana.
he
also
told
the
man
who
drove
him
up
to
baker’s
field
that
he
had
killed
mr.
smetana.
it
was
mcgautha’s
gun
i
believe
that
was
established
is
the
one
that
fired
the
fatal
shot
although
mcgautha
later
indicate
that
he
had
loan
the
gun
to
wilkinson
had
somehow
--
that
somehow
exchanged
weapons
right
before
going
in
and
of
course
the
jury
was
entitled
to
weigh
that
evidence
for
what
it
was
worth
and
what’s
very
significant
was
that
the
jury
apparently
stressed
in
its
fixation
of
penalty
who
was
the
triggerman.
what’s
significant
is
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
this
was
insignificant
under
california’s
felony
murder
rule
both
men
had
committed
first-degree
murder
and
either
or
both
could
obtain
the
death
penalty
from
the
jury.
however,
after
the
jury
brought
in
that
verdict
of
guilt,
it
was
then
that
they’ve
--
on
two
occasions
as
to
have
read
back
to
them
evidence
of
witnesses
on
that
precise
question
as
to
the
admissions
made
by
petitioner
that
he
had
shot
the
man
and
other
evidence
bearing
on
that
question.
the
district
attorney’s
argument
which
was
very
calm
and
collected
ended
with
the
sentence,
“members
of
the
jury,
i
urge
you
to
waive
this
evidence
as
to
who
fired
the
fatal
shot
and
to
give
the
man
who
fired
the
fatal
shot
the
death
penalty.”
now
furthermore,
what
do
we
have,
we
have
two
men
with
remarkably
different
backgrounds.
petitioner
is
a
four-time
loser.
he
committed
theft,
robbery
by
assault,
robbery
and
a
prior
murder.
by
contrast,
wilkinson
had
no
prior
convictions.
all
we
know
is
that
he
had
some
arrests
which
did
not
result
in
a
conviction
for
a
bad
check
account.
and
finally,
petitioner
at
the
trial
refused
to
accept
responsibility
even
as
to
the
prior
convictions
which
he
admitted
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
so
we
have
a
vivid
contrast
here.
now
basically,
respondent
affirmatively
believes
that
the
death
penalty
and
the
procedures
by
which
it’s
imposed
in
california
are
constitutional
but
perhaps
the
best
approach
to
the
question
in
the
case
at
bar
is
to
consider
the
various
objections
which
petitioner
and
his
amici
curiae
have
raised
to
the
procedure.
and
these
objections
are
basically
three.
they
are
that
the
absence
of
fixed
standards
prevents
defendant
from
knowing
to
defend
himself
at
the
penalty
proceedings.
secondly,
that
the
jury
is
permitted
to
impose
the
death
penalty
for
arbitrary
reasons,
dislike
of
the
defendant’s
expression
on
his
face,
the
color
of
his
eyes,
the
color
of
his
skin,
anything.
thirdly,
that
there
is
no
meaningful
review
of
this
decision.
it’s
an
arbitrary
decision
and
that’s
it.
well,
an
evaluation
of
these
claims
requires
a
brief
outline
of
the
special
procedures
provided
under
california
exclusively
for
the
conduct
and
review
of
penalty
to
determination
in
capital
cases.
first
of
all,
even
handed
discretion
is
conferred
upon
the
jury
by
penal
code
section
190.1
and
the
standard
instruction
and
counsel
are
allowed
broadly
way
in
their
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jurors.
and
this
case
is
a
very
good
illustration
of
that,
there
were
specific
mention
by
the
jurors
that
they
would
not
take
into
effect
--
into
account
rather
the
race
of
the
defendants,
no
bias,
no
personal
preconceptions
nothing
that
they
would
base
their
evidence
on
the
matters
before
them.
secondly,
there
are
special
rules
as
far
as
the
admissibility
of
evidence
is
concerned
and
this
is
in
accordance
with
modern
penological
views
to
allow
the
jury
to
judge
the
offender
and
not
merely
the
crime.
so
other
offenses
are
admissible
to
show
the
defendants
background
but
the
prosecution
must
establish
these
other
offenses
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
secondly,
prosecution
evidence
is
excluded
where
it’s
merely
inflammatory
and
has
slight
probative
weight.
there’ve
even
been
cases
excluding
evidence
that
the
victim
died
in
an
unusual
pain
where
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“well,
there’s
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
defendant
intended
this
unusual
pain
to
occur.”
thirdly,
there
is
a
very
wide
scope
of
evidence
allowed
in
mitigation.
the
defendant
can
bring
in
and
usually
does
bring
in
everything
and
anything.
he
can
bring
in
that
he
was
kind
to
his
dog
when
he
was
a
little
boy
at
the
age
of
five,
that
he
was
nice
to
his
mother,
that
he
had
tough
breaks
all
along
the
way,
everything
he
wants.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
jury
was
out
a
bit
longer
than
they
were
on
the
guilt
phase
and
i
believe
it
was
the
better
part
of
the
day.
but
i’m
not
clear
as
to
the
exact
amount
of
time
but
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
that.
fourthly,
in
this
respect
the
california
supreme
court
has
gone
a
way
beyond
what
this
court
held
in
the
william’s
case
no
hearsay
or
incompetent
evidence
is
permitted
on
the
issue
of
penalty,
the
prosecution
can’t
comment
and
say,
“joe
blow
heard
that
the
defendant
did
this
and
all
that.”
no,
everything
must
be
established
by
the
same
strict
rules
which
govern
the
admission
of
evidence
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
now
the
argument
that
too
is
strictly
curtailed,
the
prosecution
is
precluded
from
mentioning
such
things
as
the
fact
that
the
defendant
might
be
out
on
parole
in
seven
years
if
he
gets
the
life
sentence
.he
is
not
allowed
to
argue
all
sorts
of
things
about
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
is
considered
by
some
to
be
a
deterrent,
he
is
not
allowed
to
argue
that
the
trial
court
might
reduce
the
punishment
in
its
complete
discretion
nor
that
the
state
supreme
court
or
the
governor
might
do
that.
this
is
not
to
dilute
the
jury
sense
of
responsibility
so
none
of
that
can
be
done.
there
is
a
special
rule
of
prejudicial
error
any
substantial
error
whatsoever
requires
reversal
even
where
the
california
supreme
court
would
affirm
had
that
same
error
occurred
at
the
guilt
trial
of
a
defendant.
and
finally,
we
have
very
meaningful
review
by
the
trial
judge
who
has
complete
discretion
which
he
often
exercises
to
reduce
the
death
sentence
to
life
imprisonment
and
he
need
not
find
any
reason,
he
need
not
find
any
error
of
law,
he
need
not
do
anything,
he
can
reweigh
the
evidence
de
novo
and
for
his
own
reasons
which
need
never
be
disclose
reduce
that
death
sentence
to
life
and
that
is
done.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
can
be
done
either
way
but
i
think
it’s
a
fairly
routine
motion
which
is
made.
in
california,
there’s
always
a
two
or
three-week
gap
between
the
return
of
the
verdict
and
the
imposition
of
sentence
at
which
time
routinely
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
for
reduction
of
punishment
is
made
and
as
i
cited
in
my
brief,
no
figures
kept
on
this
but
i
was
able
to
find
two
cases
in
one
week
in
los
angeles
county
this
year
wherein
this
was
done,
that
sentence
was
reduced
to
life.
and
finally,
the
california
supreme
court,
that
review
is
certainly
meaningful
69%
of
some
58
cases
decided
in
the
last
three
years
capital
cases
have
been
reversed
by
that
court
on
the
automatic
appeal
that
that
court
has
evolve
death
penalty
cases
and
the
governor
too
has
commuted
approximately
40%.
the
ratio
is
run
like
that
of
the
death
sentences.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it’s
a
different
type
of
power.
it
cannot
decide
by
its
own
self-imposed
restriction
that
a
different
punishment
would
be
more
appropriate
but
what
it
can
do
is
reduce
the
degree
of
the
offense
and
i’ve
cited
i
believe
five
recent
cases
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
done
this.
they
said,
“well,
we’re
not
going
to
reweigh
the
evidence
here
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
should
have
receive
the
death
penalty.
however,
we
find
that
for
this
reason
or
other
there
wasn’t
really
enough
evidence
of
premeditation.
we
reduce
it
to
second
degree
and
of
course
that
automatically
immunizes
the
defendant
from
the
death
sentence
and
under
california
law
by
the
way
a
defendant
can
never
under
any
circumstances
contrary
really
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
pierce
case
received
a
death
sentence
the
second
time
around.
once
he
has
a
death
sentence
reduced
to
a
lower
degree,
he
can
never
get
first-degree
murder
again.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
the
end
of
it.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that’s
it.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
that’s’
right
and
aside
from
reweighing
evidence
of
premeditation
in
the
case
of
people
v.
anderson
which
we’ve
cited
there
the
supreme
court
said
this
was
a
murder
of
first
degree
by
virtue
of
the
felony
committed
and
we
find
that
there’s
insufficient
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
defendant
was
engaged
in
a
deviate
sexual
conduct
and
therefore
the
first-degree
murder
conviction
can’t
stand
so
we
reduced
it
to
second,
so
that
is
done
too.
and
finally
i’d
like
to
indicate
in
this
respect
that
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
you
mean
when
it’s
reduced?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true
as
modified,
it
is
affirmed
but
an
important
qualification
is
that
there
must
affirmatively
appear
in
the
records
sufficient
evidence
to
uphold
it
on
that
second-degree
theory.
when
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
that,
the
thing
is
reversed
completely
and
sent
back
for
a
new
trial,
so
that’s
only
done
when
let’s
say
the
mental
element
clearly
indicates
malice
aforethought
but
there’s
some
doubt
as
to
whether
it
rises
to
the
level
of
premeditation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
that
would
depend
exactly
what
was
involved
in
the
case,
it
can
be
done
either
way.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
two
questions
are
dealt
with
somewhat
separately
and
sometimes
only
the
penalty
is
reversed
and
sometimes
both
the
guilt
phase
and
the
penalty.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that’s’
correct
and
that
usually
means
that
the
prosecution
has
to
present
much
of
its,
if
not
all
of
its
evidence
on
the
question
of
guilt
because
the
jury
has
of
course
to
be
informed
of
that
as
the
main
basis
really
for
its
determination
whether
the
defendant
is
fit
to
live.
now,
the
death
penalty
is
a
very
selective
thing
in
california.
there
is
the
statistics
that
we’ve
cited
indicate
it’s
a
small
proportion
of
murders
which
become
murders
in
the
first
degree.
in
turn,
it’s
a
small
proportion
of
first-degree
murders
which
received
the
death
penalty
and
the
statistics
i
think
clearly
wipe
out
any
semblance
of
basis
for
the
argument
that
there’s
a
racial
overtone
to
the
death
penalty
as
far
as
california
is
concerned.
in
fact,
those
statistics
affirmatively
show
that
if
anything,
it’s
the
caucasians
who
have
received
more
death
sentences
than
racial
minorities
in
proportion
to
their
conviction
of
first-degree
murder.
now,
what
i’d
like
to
do
is
go
back
to
these
three
basic
objections
now
which
have
been
raised
and
know
how
they
bear
out.
it’s
pretty
clear
that
the
defendant
doesn’t
have
any
trouble
knowing
how
to
defend
himself.
at
the
penalty
phase,
he
is
free
to
take
anything
he
wishes
and
his
background
and
the
most
heinous
criminal
is
always
able
to
come
up
with
some
story,
some
excuse,
some
explanation
for
the
jury
so
this
isn’t
any
problem.
as
far
as
the
jury
being
permitted
to
impose
the
death
penalty
for
arbitrary
reasons,
it
is
essential
to
note
that
the
jury
is
free
to
do
this
under
any
system,
a
system
of
fixed
standards
they
can
still
do
it,
they
can
bet
told
don’t
consider
his
race,
don’t
consider
the
expression
on
his
face
and
they
can
still
come
back
and
do
that
and
there
is
no
system
devisable
by
man
that
can
preclude
that
possibility.
and
in
fact,
the
royal
commission
in
great
britain
found
that
jurors
were
exercising
their
discretion
in
mandatory
capital
offenses
where
they
felt
that
they
didn’t
like
the
death
penalty
for
this
particular
individual,
they
would
find
the
man
not
guilty
or
find
him
guilty
of
a
lesser
offense
admittedly
for
that
purpose
to
preclude
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
so
there
is
no
system
that
can
get
away
from
the
possibility,
humanly
acceptable
of
some
discretion.
now
the
standard
which
have
been
proposed
by
petitioner
an
amici
curiae
fixed
standards
this
i
think
are
rather
unrealistic
attempts
to
try
and
categorize
every
conceivable
factual
situation
and
this
is
impossible.
but
what’s
significant
is
i
was
frankly
even
startled
when
i
reviewed
each
of
the
128
capital
cases
decided
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
last
five
years
i
could
not
find
one
that
did
not
include
at
least
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
specified
by
the
model
penal
code
such
as
more
than
one
victim,
a
victim
of
police
officer
committed
during
the
course
of
a
rape
or
robbery,
during
an
attempt
to
escape
custody
or
particular
heinousness.
everyone
of
these
elements
or
rather
one
of
them
was
always
present
and
what’s
almost
amusing
is
that
the
fixed
standards
not
only
or
they
not
workable
or
effective
as
far
as
their
aim.
they
don’t
escape
the
so
called
vice
of
vagueness
or
arbitrariness
because
since
it’s
impossible
to
make
an
exclusive
list
of
all
mitigating
circumstances
and
this
is
what
really
can
re-down
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
defendant
or
aggravating
factors
they
leave
a
loophole
they
say
or
anything
else
that
would
particularly
indicate
cruel
unusual
cruelness
or
depravity.
so
it’s
still
open
ended
and
i
think
that
fixed
standards
would
result
in
more
death
verdicts
because
jurors
would
feel
inclined
to
say
we’ll
hear
we
find
two
or
three
of
this
things
here.
the
man
has
a
prior
record
to
that
he
shot
more
than
one
victim.
i
guess
this
is
in
a
proper
case
for
the
exercise
of
our
mercy
function.
and
how
is
an
appellate
court
going
to
review
something
under
these
fixed
standards?
how
are
they
going
to
decide?
there’s
enough
evidence
of
aggravation
or
there
isn’t
enough
of
mitigation
and
there
some
of
each
and
we’re
going
to
reweigh
this.
this
is,
i
think
an
impossible
task
to
try
to
impose
upon
an
appellate
court
and
of
course
despite
petitioner’s
denials
it’s
very
obvious
that
his
arguments
implicate
judge
sentencing
not
only
in
capital
cases
but
judge
sentencing
in
other
criminal
cases.
it
implicates
the
granting
and
denial
of
probation.
it
implicates
the
fixing
of
indeterminate
terms
by
an
administrative
agency
and
it
implicates
parole
proceedings
and
possibly
even
clemency
although
that
may
be
an
extra
legal
function.
now,
this
is
basically
what
the
fixed
standard
proposal
means
that
the
jury
needs
a
list
defining
all
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
and
a
formula
for
weighing
them
something
like
a+b+c-x
and
y.
this
i
would
like
to
inquire
how
does
this
aid
the
juries
function
in
determining
as
this
court
said
in
witherspoon
whether
a
defendant
is
fit
to
live.
this
is
not
a
matter
for
expertise.
this
is
a
matter
of
expressing
the
conscience
of
the
community.
the
proposals
that
petitioner
has
advance
would
turn
the
fact-finding
process.
it
would
rather
turn
the
fixing
of
punishment
into
a
fact-finding
process
and
this
is
totally
foreign
to
the
concept
of
punishment
fixing
even
with
special
verdicts.
this
couldn’t
properly
be
evaluated.
and
i
think
this
is
important
that
to
be
effective,
fixed
standards
would
have
to
impel
a
death
verdict
in
some
factual
context.
they
would
have
to
say
if
you
find
these
aggravating
circumstances
in
return
a
verdict
of
death,
however
they
leave
a
loophole,
they
say
despite
aggravating
circumstances
even
if
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
you
can
still
return
a
verdict
of
life.
now
this
is
probably
just
and
proper
but
it
shows
that
what
these
proposals
for
fixed
standards
really
amount
to
in
the
last
instance
is
a
contention
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
impelled
preference
for
life.
and
this
by
the
backdoor
and
this
is
a
different
thing
from
saying
that
there
is
a
permissible
legislative
preference
for
life.
where
does
the
constitution
express
a
preference
for
life?
it
doesn’t
and
yet
this
would
be
the
end-result.
on
the
contrary,
the
constitution
and
the
fifth
amendments
speaks
of
capital
offenses
and
recognize
them.
and
if
you
don’t
have
this
loophole
which
the
proponents
of
fixed
standards
that
may
then
you
have
unavoidable
and
desirable
jury
discretion
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
there
is
not
a
specific
one
but
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
what
petitioner
advances
as
his
suggestion
for
standards
and
inquire
whether
this
would
meet
constitutional
requirements
objections
to
vagueness
and
i
quote
from
petitioner’s
brief
and
that
stated
page
27
of
his
brief
in
note
19.
“consideration
of
the
choice
of
penalty
could
be
standard
around
these
objectives
that
is
a
penalty
with
a
view
of
choosing
that
one
which
having
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
the
character
and
temperament
of
the
defendant
with
mostly
nearly
further
rather
than
frustrate
them.”
now
i
inquire
if
this
is
any
kind
of
standard,
i
don’t
know
what
the
jury
would
do
in
trying
to
follow
this
or
an
appellate
court
trying
to
review
this.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
the
nearest
to
accept
cross-reference
to
the
model
penal
code
set
of
factors
which
i’ve
discussed.
now
in
a
very
short
time
remaining
i
would
like
to
note
this
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
stated
california
could
abolish
the
degrees
of
murder
and
fix
the
penalty
of
death
where
there
was
a
certain
standard
of
aggravation
consisting
a
premeditation
or
felony
murder
in
the
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances
which
they
could
define
as
the
statute
does,
the
defendant
being
under
18
years
age
or
else
there
could
be
a
first-agree
mandatory
death
sentence
as
delaware
has
with
the
judges’
power
to
reduce
it
to
life.
a
discretionary
power
when
the
jury
recommends
that.
but
the
logical
end
result
of
petitioner’s
arguments
is
this,
either
no
death
penalty
or
a
mandatory
death
penalty
and
we
submit
that
either
one
is
undesirable.
and
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state
this
first
of
all
petitioner
is
no,
in
no
position
to
raise
this
contentions
which
are
not
really
applicable
to
his
situation
or
himself
these
vague
claims
of
arbitrariness,
racial
bias
possibility
and
all
that.
the
record
affirmatively
discloses
a
constitutional
basis
for
this
and
as
this
court
said
in
harris
we
shouldn’t
permit
the
possibility
that
abuses
occur
to
give
sinister
coloration
to
procedures
that
are
basically
reasonable.
now,
finally
we
submit
that
jury
discretion
is
an
unavoidable
feature
of
capital
punishment
as
the
royal
commission
indicated
even
where
there
is
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
aside
from
being
unavoidable
it
is
desirable
from
the
standpoint
of
fairness
as
it
enables
the
jury
to
best
carry
out
its
function
of
expressing
the
conscience
of
the
community
as
witherspoon
sets
out
and
not
only
is
it
desirable
it
is
to
the
defendants
advantage
as
we
have
indicated
it
would
result
in
more
death
verdicts
to
have
fixed
standards.
and
as
some
of
petitioners
amici
are
ready
to
admit
their
theoretical
and
unrealistic
campaign
for
fixed
standards,
artificial
and
arbitrarily
fixed
standards
is
only
a
device
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
at
least
with
respect
to
the
550
men
now
under
sentence
of
death
and
they
admitted
in
maxwell
v.
bishop
that
they
are
ready
to
urge
the
very
unconstitutionality
of
those
fixed
standards
whose
absence
they
now
decry
as
constitutional
error.
so
before
accepting
the
theoretical
arguments
of
petitioner
and
his
amici
that
fixed
standards
are
the
only
procedure
that
a
state
may
enact
for
jury
determination
of
penalty
in
capital
cases,
it
must
be
remembered
that
over
550
dangerous
persons
who
committed
the
worst
of
the
most
vicious
crimes
would
be
perhaps
permanently
immunized
from
receiving
the
death
sentence
despite
to
considered
judgment
of
thousands
of
jurors
and
hundreds
of
judges
that
the
interest
of
society
demanded
the
extreme
penalty.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
on
direct
review
from
the
california
supreme
court
involves
the
single
issue
whether
petitioner
was
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
procedure
under
which
the
jury
was
entrusted
with
the
decision
whether
he
should
be
punished
alternatively
with
death
or
life
imprisonment
and
the
resolution
of
this
issue
will
affect
the
sentences
of
each
of
the
over
550
prisoners
in
the
nation
under
sentence
of
death.
the
procedure
which
is
involved
in
petitioner’s
case
under
california
law
provided
that
after
the
jury
found
petitioner
guilty
of
first-degree
murder,
additional
evidence
and
argument
on
the
issue
of
punishment
was
received
and
the
jury
return
of
penalty
verdict
after
being
instructed
as
follows.
first
of
all
that
the
proper
factors
to
consider
in
guiding
its
discretion
in
fixing
the
punishment
were
so
and
so
i’ll
get
into
those
and
more
detail
but
they
were
instructed
as
to
certain
factors.
i’ll
mention
in
summary
form
these
factors
included
all
the
evidence
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime
of
each
defendant’s
background
and
history
and
of
the
facts
and
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
penalty.
the
jury
was
further
instructed
to
base
its
decision
on
the
evidence
received
in
court.
the
jury
was
instructed
as
to
the
necessity
of
not
being
arbitrary
or
governed
by
mere
conjecture,
prejudice
or
public
opinion.
however,
and
if
anything
these
tips
the
scales
in
the
defendant’s
direction,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
could
be
influenced
by
pity,
mere
sentiment,
or
sympathy
for
the
defendant.
thus,
the
question
at
bar
is
not
whether
it
is
constitutional
to
submit
the
jury
of
penalty
in
a
capital
case
to
a
jury
without
any
standards.
the
question
properly
before
this
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
standards
which
are
provided
by
california
are
constitutionally
adequate.
i
might
mention
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan’s
question
that
there
are
indeed
two
offenses
that
i’m
aware
of
under
california
law
which
provide
for
the
jury
to
fix
the
punishment.
those
happened
to
be
penal
code
section
193,
vehicular
manslaughter
and
section
264,
statutory
rape.
now
i’d
like
to
give
a
very
brief
outline
of
the
factual
situation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
statutory
rape,
i
believe
it
is
one
to
fifty
years.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
fifty
(50),
yes.
and
in
vehicular
manslaughter,
it’s
lesser
range.
there
is
a
choice
in
some
offenses
i
would
just
guess
about
three
or
four
that
the
jury
is
entrusted
with
whether
to
send
the
defendant
to
state
prison
or
instead
to
county
jail
and
then
in
those
situations
specified
terms
are
provided
by
statute.
now,
outlining
briefly
the
factual
context
of
this
case
because
i
think
it’s
very
important
to
approach
this
case
is
a
living
reality
and
not
as
a
in
a
factual
vacuum
not
a
metaphysical
exercise
here
but
we’re
dealing
with
the
rights
of
one
individual
and
specific
facts
here.
the
offense
itself,
well,
the
victim
was
the
owner
of
a
little
market
which
he
and
his
wife
operated.
the
death
of
the
victim
occurred
during
a
holdup
committed
by
petitioner
and
his
co-defendant
mr.
wilkinson.
petitioner
was
41
years
of
age.
wilkinson
was
25.
this
was
an
unnecessary
cold-blooded
execution
of
mr.
smetana
the
owner.
he
offered
no
threat,
he
was
unarmed.
he
didn’t
attempt
to
obtain
a
weapon.
he
was
five
foot,
three
inches
tall,
a
hundred
and
thirty-five
pounds,
52
years
of
age.
he
could
have
been
robbed
without
a
weapon.
there
was
certainly
no
reason
to
kill
this
man.
petitioner
--
there’s
evidence
showing
that
he
told
and
mrs.
dupree
later
on
that
he
was
the
one
who
had
killed
mr.
smetana.
he
also
told
the
man
who
drove
him
up
to
baker’s
field
that
he
had
killed
mr.
smetana.
it
was
mcgautha’s
gun
i
believe
that
was
established
is
the
one
that
fired
the
fatal
shot
although
mcgautha
later
indicate
that
he
had
loan
the
gun
to
wilkinson
had
somehow
--
that
somehow
exchanged
weapons
right
before
going
in
and
of
course
the
jury
was
entitled
to
weigh
that
evidence
for
what
it
was
worth
and
what’s
very
significant
was
that
the
jury
apparently
stressed
in
its
fixation
of
penalty
who
was
the
triggerman.
what’s
significant
is
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
this
was
insignificant
under
california’s
felony
murder
rule
both
men
had
committed
first-degree
murder
and
either
or
both
could
obtain
the
death
penalty
from
the
jury.
however,
after
the
jury
brought
in
that
verdict
of
guilt,
it
was
then
that
they’ve
--
on
two
occasions
as
to
have
read
back
to
them
evidence
of
witnesses
on
that
precise
question
as
to
the
admissions
made
by
petitioner
that
he
had
shot
the
man
and
other
evidence
bearing
on
that
question.
the
district
attorney’s
argument
which
was
very
calm
and
collected
ended
with
the
sentence,
“members
of
the
jury,
i
urge
you
to
waive
this
evidence
as
to
who
fired
the
fatal
shot
and
to
give
the
man
who
fired
the
fatal
shot
the
death
penalty.”
now
furthermore,
what
do
we
have,
we
have
two
men
with
remarkably
different
backgrounds.
petitioner
is
a
four-time
loser.
he
committed
theft,
robbery
by
assault,
robbery
and
a
prior
murder.
by
contrast,
wilkinson
had
no
prior
convictions.
all
we
know
is
that
he
had
some
arrests
which
did
not
result
in
a
conviction
for
a
bad
check
account.
and
finally,
petitioner
at
the
trial
refused
to
accept
responsibility
even
as
to
the
prior
convictions
which
he
admitted
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
so
we
have
a
vivid
contrast
here.
now
basically,
respondent
affirmatively
believes
that
the
death
penalty
and
the
procedures
by
which
it’s
imposed
in
california
are
constitutional
but
perhaps
the
best
approach
to
the
question
in
the
case
at
bar
is
to
consider
the
various
objections
which
petitioner
and
his
amici
curiae
have
raised
to
the
procedure.
and
these
objections
are
basically
three.
they
are
that
the
absence
of
fixed
standards
prevents
defendant
from
knowing
to
defend
himself
at
the
penalty
proceedings.
secondly,
that
the
jury
is
permitted
to
impose
the
death
penalty
for
arbitrary
reasons,
dislike
of
the
defendant’s
expression
on
his
face,
the
color
of
his
eyes,
the
color
of
his
skin,
anything.
thirdly,
that
there
is
no
meaningful
review
of
this
decision.
it’s
an
arbitrary
decision
and
that’s
it.
well,
an
evaluation
of
these
claims
requires
a
brief
outline
of
the
special
procedures
provided
under
california
exclusively
for
the
conduct
and
review
of
penalty
to
determination
in
capital
cases.
first
of
all,
even
handed
discretion
is
conferred
upon
the
jury
by
penal
code
section
190.1
and
the
standard
instruction
and
counsel
are
allowed
broadly
way
in
their
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jurors.
and
this
case
is
a
very
good
illustration
of
that,
there
were
specific
mention
by
the
jurors
that
they
would
not
take
into
effect
--
into
account
rather
the
race
of
the
defendants,
no
bias,
no
personal
preconceptions
nothing
that
they
would
base
their
evidence
on
the
matters
before
them.
secondly,
there
are
special
rules
as
far
as
the
admissibility
of
evidence
is
concerned
and
this
is
in
accordance
with
modern
penological
views
to
allow
the
jury
to
judge
the
offender
and
not
merely
the
crime.
so
other
offenses
are
admissible
to
show
the
defendants
background
but
the
prosecution
must
establish
these
other
offenses
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
secondly,
prosecution
evidence
is
excluded
where
it’s
merely
inflammatory
and
has
slight
probative
weight.
there’ve
even
been
cases
excluding
evidence
that
the
victim
died
in
an
unusual
pain
where
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“well,
there’s
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
defendant
intended
this
unusual
pain
to
occur.”
thirdly,
there
is
a
very
wide
scope
of
evidence
allowed
in
mitigation.
the
defendant
can
bring
in
and
usually
does
bring
in
everything
and
anything.
he
can
bring
in
that
he
was
kind
to
his
dog
when
he
was
a
little
boy
at
the
age
of
five,
that
he
was
nice
to
his
mother,
that
he
had
tough
breaks
all
along
the
way,
everything
he
wants.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
jury
was
out
a
bit
longer
than
they
were
on
the
guilt
phase
and
i
believe
it
was
the
better
part
of
the
day.
but
i’m
not
clear
as
to
the
exact
amount
of
time
but
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
that.
fourthly,
in
this
respect
the
california
supreme
court
has
gone
a
way
beyond
what
this
court
held
in
the
william’s
case
no
hearsay
or
incompetent
evidence
is
permitted
on
the
issue
of
penalty,
the
prosecution
can’t
comment
and
say,
“joe
blow
heard
that
the
defendant
did
this
and
all
that.”
no,
everything
must
be
established
by
the
same
strict
rules
which
govern
the
admission
of
evidence
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
now
the
argument
that
too
is
strictly
curtailed,
the
prosecution
is
precluded
from
mentioning
such
things
as
the
fact
that
the
defendant
might
be
out
on
parole
in
seven
years
if
he
gets
the
life
sentence
.he
is
not
allowed
to
argue
all
sorts
of
things
about
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
is
considered
by
some
to
be
a
deterrent,
he
is
not
allowed
to
argue
that
the
trial
court
might
reduce
the
punishment
in
its
complete
discretion
nor
that
the
state
supreme
court
or
the
governor
might
do
that.
this
is
not
to
dilute
the
jury
sense
of
responsibility
so
none
of
that
can
be
done.
there
is
a
special
rule
of
prejudicial
error
any
substantial
error
whatsoever
requires
reversal
even
where
the
california
supreme
court
would
affirm
had
that
same
error
occurred
at
the
guilt
trial
of
a
defendant.
and
finally,
we
have
very
meaningful
review
by
the
trial
judge
who
has
complete
discretion
which
he
often
exercises
to
reduce
the
death
sentence
to
life
imprisonment
and
he
need
not
find
any
reason,
he
need
not
find
any
error
of
law,
he
need
not
do
anything,
he
can
reweigh
the
evidence
de
novo
and
for
his
own
reasons
which
need
never
be
disclose
reduce
that
death
sentence
to
life
and
that
is
done.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
can
be
done
either
way
but
i
think
it’s
a
fairly
routine
motion
which
is
made.
in
california,
there’s
always
a
two
or
three-week
gap
between
the
return
of
the
verdict
and
the
imposition
of
sentence
at
which
time
routinely
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
for
reduction
of
punishment
is
made
and
as
i
cited
in
my
brief,
no
figures
kept
on
this
but
i
was
able
to
find
two
cases
in
one
week
in
los
angeles
county
this
year
wherein
this
was
done,
that
sentence
was
reduced
to
life.
and
finally,
the
california
supreme
court,
that
review
is
certainly
meaningful
69%
of
some
58
cases
decided
in
the
last
three
years
capital
cases
have
been
reversed
by
that
court
on
the
automatic
appeal
that
that
court
has
evolve
death
penalty
cases
and
the
governor
too
has
commuted
approximately
40%.
the
ratio
is
run
like
that
of
the
death
sentences.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it’s
a
different
type
of
power.
it
cannot
decide
by
its
own
self-imposed
restriction
that
a
different
punishment
would
be
more
appropriate
but
what
it
can
do
is
reduce
the
degree
of
the
offense
and
i’ve
cited
i
believe
five
recent
cases
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
done
this.
they
said,
“well,
we’re
not
going
to
reweigh
the
evidence
here
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
should
have
receive
the
death
penalty.
however,
we
find
that
for
this
reason
or
other
there
wasn’t
really
enough
evidence
of
premeditation.
we
reduce
it
to
second
degree
and
of
course
that
automatically
immunizes
the
defendant
from
the
death
sentence
and
under
california
law
by
the
way
a
defendant
can
never
under
any
circumstances
contrary
really
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
pierce
case
received
a
death
sentence
the
second
time
around.
once
he
has
a
death
sentence
reduced
to
a
lower
degree,
he
can
never
get
first-degree
murder
again.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
the
end
of
it.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that’s
it.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
that’s’
right
and
aside
from
reweighing
evidence
of
premeditation
in
the
case
of
people
v.
anderson
which
we’ve
cited
there
the
supreme
court
said
this
was
a
murder
of
first
degree
by
virtue
of
the
felony
committed
and
we
find
that
there’s
insufficient
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
defendant
was
engaged
in
a
deviate
sexual
conduct
and
therefore
the
first-degree
murder
conviction
can’t
stand
so
we
reduced
it
to
second,
so
that
is
done
too.
and
finally
i’d
like
to
indicate
in
this
respect
that
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
you
mean
when
it’s
reduced?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true
as
modified,
it
is
affirmed
but
an
important
qualification
is
that
there
must
affirmatively
appear
in
the
records
sufficient
evidence
to
uphold
it
on
that
second-degree
theory.
when
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
that,
the
thing
is
reversed
completely
and
sent
back
for
a
new
trial,
so
that’s
only
done
when
let’s
say
the
mental
element
clearly
indicates
malice
aforethought
but
there’s
some
doubt
as
to
whether
it
rises
to
the
level
of
premeditation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
that
would
depend
exactly
what
was
involved
in
the
case,
it
can
be
done
either
way.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
two
questions
are
dealt
with
somewhat
separately
and
sometimes
only
the
penalty
is
reversed
and
sometimes
both
the
guilt
phase
and
the
penalty.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that’s’
correct
and
that
usually
means
that
the
prosecution
has
to
present
much
of
its,
if
not
all
of
its
evidence
on
the
question
of
guilt
because
the
jury
has
of
course
to
be
informed
of
that
as
the
main
basis
really
for
its
determination
whether
the
defendant
is
fit
to
live.
now,
the
death
penalty
is
a
very
selective
thing
in
california.
there
is
the
statistics
that
we’ve
cited
indicate
it’s
a
small
proportion
of
murders
which
become
murders
in
the
first
degree.
in
turn,
it’s
a
small
proportion
of
first-degree
murders
which
received
the
death
penalty
and
the
statistics
i
think
clearly
wipe
out
any
semblance
of
basis
for
the
argument
that
there’s
a
racial
overtone
to
the
death
penalty
as
far
as
california
is
concerned.
in
fact,
those
statistics
affirmatively
show
that
if
anything,
it’s
the
caucasians
who
have
received
more
death
sentences
than
racial
minorities
in
proportion
to
their
conviction
of
first-degree
murder.
now,
what
i’d
like
to
do
is
go
back
to
these
three
basic
objections
now
which
have
been
raised
and
know
how
they
bear
out.
it’s
pretty
clear
that
the
defendant
doesn’t
have
any
trouble
knowing
how
to
defend
himself.
at
the
penalty
phase,
he
is
free
to
take
anything
he
wishes
and
his
background
and
the
most
heinous
criminal
is
always
able
to
come
up
with
some
story,
some
excuse,
some
explanation
for
the
jury
so
this
isn’t
any
problem.
as
far
as
the
jury
being
permitted
to
impose
the
death
penalty
for
arbitrary
reasons,
it
is
essential
to
note
that
the
jury
is
free
to
do
this
under
any
system,
a
system
of
fixed
standards
they
can
still
do
it,
they
can
bet
told
don’t
consider
his
race,
don’t
consider
the
expression
on
his
face
and
they
can
still
come
back
and
do
that
and
there
is
no
system
devisable
by
man
that
can
preclude
that
possibility.
and
in
fact,
the
royal
commission
in
great
britain
found
that
jurors
were
exercising
their
discretion
in
mandatory
capital
offenses
where
they
felt
that
they
didn’t
like
the
death
penalty
for
this
particular
individual,
they
would
find
the
man
not
guilty
or
find
him
guilty
of
a
lesser
offense
admittedly
for
that
purpose
to
preclude
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
so
there
is
no
system
that
can
get
away
from
the
possibility,
humanly
acceptable
of
some
discretion.
now
the
standard
which
have
been
proposed
by
petitioner
an
amici
curiae
fixed
standards
this
i
think
are
rather
unrealistic
attempts
to
try
and
categorize
every
conceivable
factual
situation
and
this
is
impossible.
but
what’s
significant
is
i
was
frankly
even
startled
when
i
reviewed
each
of
the
128
capital
cases
decided
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
last
five
years
i
could
not
find
one
that
did
not
include
at
least
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
specified
by
the
model
penal
code
such
as
more
than
one
victim,
a
victim
of
police
officer
committed
during
the
course
of
a
rape
or
robbery,
during
an
attempt
to
escape
custody
or
particular
heinousness.
everyone
of
these
elements
or
rather
one
of
them
was
always
present
and
what’s
almost
amusing
is
that
the
fixed
standards
not
only
or
they
not
workable
or
effective
as
far
as
their
aim.
they
don’t
escape
the
so
called
vice
of
vagueness
or
arbitrariness
because
since
it’s
impossible
to
make
an
exclusive
list
of
all
mitigating
circumstances
and
this
is
what
really
can
re-down
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
defendant
or
aggravating
factors
they
leave
a
loophole
they
say
or
anything
else
that
would
particularly
indicate
cruel
unusual
cruelness
or
depravity.
so
it’s
still
open
ended
and
i
think
that
fixed
standards
would
result
in
more
death
verdicts
because
jurors
would
feel
inclined
to
say
we’ll
hear
we
find
two
or
three
of
this
things
here.
the
man
has
a
prior
record
to
that
he
shot
more
than
one
victim.
i
guess
this
is
in
a
proper
case
for
the
exercise
of
our
mercy
function.
and
how
is
an
appellate
court
going
to
review
something
under
these
fixed
standards?
how
are
they
going
to
decide?
there’s
enough
evidence
of
aggravation
or
there
isn’t
enough
of
mitigation
and
there
some
of
each
and
we’re
going
to
reweigh
this.
this
is,
i
think
an
impossible
task
to
try
to
impose
upon
an
appellate
court
and
of
course
despite
petitioner’s
denials
it’s
very
obvious
that
his
arguments
implicate
judge
sentencing
not
only
in
capital
cases
but
judge
sentencing
in
other
criminal
cases.
it
implicates
the
granting
and
denial
of
probation.
it
implicates
the
fixing
of
indeterminate
terms
by
an
administrative
agency
and
it
implicates
parole
proceedings
and
possibly
even
clemency
although
that
may
be
an
extra
legal
function.
now,
this
is
basically
what
the
fixed
standard
proposal
means
that
the
jury
needs
a
list
defining
all
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
and
a
formula
for
weighing
them
something
like
a+b+c-x
and
y.
this
i
would
like
to
inquire
how
does
this
aid
the
juries
function
in
determining
as
this
court
said
in
witherspoon
whether
a
defendant
is
fit
to
live.
this
is
not
a
matter
for
expertise.
this
is
a
matter
of
expressing
the
conscience
of
the
community.
the
proposals
that
petitioner
has
advance
would
turn
the
fact-finding
process.
it
would
rather
turn
the
fixing
of
punishment
into
a
fact-finding
process
and
this
is
totally
foreign
to
the
concept
of
punishment
fixing
even
with
special
verdicts.
this
couldn’t
properly
be
evaluated.
and
i
think
this
is
important
that
to
be
effective,
fixed
standards
would
have
to
impel
a
death
verdict
in
some
factual
context.
they
would
have
to
say
if
you
find
these
aggravating
circumstances
in
return
a
verdict
of
death,
however
they
leave
a
loophole,
they
say
despite
aggravating
circumstances
even
if
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
you
can
still
return
a
verdict
of
life.
now
this
is
probably
just
and
proper
but
it
shows
that
what
these
proposals
for
fixed
standards
really
amount
to
in
the
last
instance
is
a
contention
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
impelled
preference
for
life.
and
this
by
the
backdoor
and
this
is
a
different
thing
from
saying
that
there
is
a
permissible
legislative
preference
for
life.
where
does
the
constitution
express
a
preference
for
life?
it
doesn’t
and
yet
this
would
be
the
end-result.
on
the
contrary,
the
constitution
and
the
fifth
amendments
speaks
of
capital
offenses
and
recognize
them.
and
if
you
don’t
have
this
loophole
which
the
proponents
of
fixed
standards
that
may
then
you
have
unavoidable
and
desirable
jury
discretion
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
there
is
not
a
specific
one
but
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
what
petitioner
advances
as
his
suggestion
for
standards
and
inquire
whether
this
would
meet
constitutional
requirements
objections
to
vagueness
and
i
quote
from
petitioner’s
brief
and
that
stated
page
27
of
his
brief
in
note
19.
“consideration
of
the
choice
of
penalty
could
be
standard
around
these
objectives
that
is
a
penalty
with
a
view
of
choosing
that
one
which
having
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
the
character
and
temperament
of
the
defendant
with
mostly
nearly
further
rather
than
frustrate
them.”
now
i
inquire
if
this
is
any
kind
of
standard,
i
don’t
know
what
the
jury
would
do
in
trying
to
follow
this
or
an
appellate
court
trying
to
review
this.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
the
nearest
to
accept
cross-reference
to
the
model
penal
code
set
of
factors
which
i’ve
discussed.
now
in
a
very
short
time
remaining
i
would
like
to
note
this
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
stated
california
could
abolish
the
degrees
of
murder
and
fix
the
penalty
of
death
where
there
was
a
certain
standard
of
aggravation
consisting
a
premeditation
or
felony
murder
in
the
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances
which
they
could
define
as
the
statute
does,
the
defendant
being
under
18
years
age
or
else
there
could
be
a
first-agree
mandatory
death
sentence
as
delaware
has
with
the
judges’
power
to
reduce
it
to
life.
a
discretionary
power
when
the
jury
recommends
that.
but
the
logical
end
result
of
petitioner’s
arguments
is
this,
either
no
death
penalty
or
a
mandatory
death
penalty
and
we
submit
that
either
one
is
undesirable.
and
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state
this
first
of
all
petitioner
is
no,
in
no
position
to
raise
this
contentions
which
are
not
really
applicable
to
his
situation
or
himself
these
vague
claims
of
arbitrariness,
racial
bias
possibility
and
all
that.
the
record
affirmatively
discloses
a
constitutional
basis
for
this
and
as
this
court
said
in
harris
we
shouldn’t
permit
the
possibility
that
abuses
occur
to
give
sinister
coloration
to
procedures
that
are
basically
reasonable.
now,
finally
we
submit
that
jury
discretion
is
an
unavoidable
feature
of
capital
punishment
as
the
royal
commission
indicated
even
where
there
is
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
aside
from
being
unavoidable
it
is
desirable
from
the
standpoint
of
fairness
as
it
enables
the
jury
to
best
carry
out
its
function
of
expressing
the
conscience
of
the
community
as
witherspoon
sets
out
and
not
only
is
it
desirable
it
is
to
the
defendants
advantage
as
we
have
indicated
it
would
result
in
more
death
verdicts
to
have
fixed
standards.
and
as
some
of
petitioners
amici
are
ready
to
admit
their
theoretical
and
unrealistic
campaign
for
fixed
standards,
artificial
and
arbitrarily
fixed
standards
is
only
a
device
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
at
least
with
respect
to
the
550
men
now
under
sentence
of
death
and
they
admitted
in
maxwell
v.
bishop
that
they
are
ready
to
urge
the
very
unconstitutionality
of
those
fixed
standards
whose
absence
they
now
decry
as
constitutional
error.
so
before
accepting
the
theoretical
arguments
of
petitioner
and
his
amici
that
fixed
standards
are
the
only
procedure
that
a
state
may
enact
for
jury
determination
of
penalty
in
capital
cases,
it
must
be
remembered
that
over
550
dangerous
persons
who
committed
the
worst
of
the
most
vicious
crimes
would
be
perhaps
permanently
immunized
from
receiving
the
death
sentence
despite
to
considered
judgment
of
thousands
of
jurors
and
hundreds
of
judges
that
the
interest
of
society
demanded
the
extreme
penalty.
