e.

the
court
will
hear
arguments
in
the
first
case,
number
203,
dennis
mcgautha
against
the
state
of
california.
mr.
selvin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
selvin,
while
you’re
on
that
subject,
let
me
go
back
to
your
observations
about
the
expert’s
posture
of
the
judge
imposing
the
sentence
where
you
indicated,
if
i
heard
you
correctly
that
the
legislature
could
vest
this
power
in
the
judge
without
standards.
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
square
with
the
idea
that
was
widely
held,
widely
expressed
that
the
jury
and
the
whole
process
is
to
express
the
community
conscience,
it
distinguish
between
the
judge
as
an
expert
and
the
jurors
as
non-expert
layman
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
the
judge
fixes
the
sentence,
is
he
making
a
legal
decision
in
your
view?
is
that
a
question
of
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you’re
right
in
the
proposition
that
it’s
a
question
of
law,
then
how
can
the
jury
be
deciding
it
at
all,
with
or
without
guidance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
selvin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
your
argument
comes
down
to
mr.
selvin
in
the
sense
is
that
the
legislature
of
california
could
vest
this
uncontrolled,
unguided
power
in
a
judge
or
the
legislature
could
reserve
it
to
itself
unguided
and
without
articulated
reasons
by
a
mandatory
death
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
pending
the
constitution
in
either
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
selvin.
mr.
george.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
done
--
is
that
done
sua
sponte
or
only
on
application?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
for
a
new
trial,
you
mean
on
penalty
only?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
basis
of
reversal
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
goes
back
for
a
new
trial
on
penalty
only,
a
new
jury
is
whose
panel
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
george.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
selvin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
should
be
required?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
jury
might
disagree
on
the
reasons
for
finding
a
verdict
if
not
guilty
or
unless
charge,
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
are
affirmatively
told,
are
they
not
that
they
make
this
decision
on
all
the
evidence
that
they
have
heard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
defendant
--
would
you
say
that
the
defendant
has
any
real
limits
on
what
he
can
put
before
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
suggest
that
that
would
be
helpful
to
a
defendant
in
this
situation,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
have
to
be
told
that
he
might
--
have
the
jury
told
that
he
might
be
out
on
the
street
very
soon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
selvin.
you
acted
at
the
appointment
of
the
court
and
at
our
request
and
we
thank
you
for
your
assistance,
not
only
to
the
petitioner
but
your
assistance
to
the
court.
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general,
mr.
attorney
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
204,
crampton
against
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
callahan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
trial
judge
in
ohio
or
the
reviewing
court
alter
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
consider
that
an
important
--
further
important
distinction
from
the
mcgautha
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
this
question
while
you’re
pausing
here.
is
it
not
as
practical
matter
possible
for
a
defendant
in
any
capital
case
to
put
the
whole
range
of
his
right
in
evidence
by
use
of
psychiatric
and
other
expert
testimony
as
to
his
background,
his
boyhood,
his
habits,
his
narcotic
addition
if
any,
the
whole
range
of
his
behavior
pattern,
and
his
lifestyle?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
can
put
it
in
without
being
subjected
himself
to
cross-examination,
put
it
in
through
the
mouth
of
an
expert.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
say
this
often
happens
but
it
doesn’t
necessarily
happen
does
it
that
this
incriminating
evidence
comes
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
essentially
a
question
for
the
state
of
ohio
however,
the
ohio
courts,
the
ohio
legislature.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
states
which
have
had
bifurcated
trials
in
some
areas
of
the
criminal
justice
have
abandoned
it
after
trying
it
out
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
earliest
date
of
any
state
adopting
the
bifurcated
trial
on
the
issue
of
capital
punishment?
california
was
57
[voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fine,
we’ll
recess
for
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed
mr.
callahan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
callahan
as
a
practical
matter
isn’t
it
true
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
defendant’s
have
other
factors
that
inhibit
him
from
taking
the
stand
whether
there’s
a
death
penalty
involved
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
this
choice
is
that
much
more
important
than
the
capital
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
only
real
difference,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
every
defendant
in
every
criminal
case
is
somewhat
chilled
or
otherwise
discouraged
about
taking
the
stand
in
most
cases
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ubut
you’re
not
suggesting
that
either
this
defendant
or
defendants
generally
in
capital
cases
would
take
the
stand
except
for
this
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that’s
just
another
way
of
saying
that
if
you
have
a
bifurcated
trial
he
has
nothing
to
lose
because
he
doesn’t
reach
the
second
stage
until
he
has
been
found
guilty
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
wherever
he
has
nowhere
to
go
except
to
prove
his
posture
that’s
the
reality
of
it
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
take
this
bifurcated
situation
whether
it’s
a
second
trial
on
penalty
only.
he
is
not
compelled
to
take
the
stand
is
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
states
in
the
cases
where
they
have
the
two-stage
trial
may
put
in
very
wide
range
of
evidence
adverse
to
him
factors
and
aggravation,
whether
he
takes
that
stand
or
whether
he
doesn’t.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
callahan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
have
you
answered
mr.
blackmun’s
question
yet
fully?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
one
more
question.
you
have
me
a
little
bit
confused
when
you
referred
to
a
separate
stage
trial
on
the
issue
of
criminal
responsibility
or
the
insanity
claim.
you
don’t
raise
that
as
the
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
callahan.
mr.
resnick,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
resnick.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
callahan,
you
have
10
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
not
the
criminal
responsibility
also
go
to
the
question
of
guilt
in
the
legal
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we,
california
at
least
bifurcates
that
trial
good
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
wouldn’t
be
very
remarkable
if
someone
would
build
on
the
analogy
of
bifurcated
trials
for
insanity
question
to
bifurcated
trial
for
alibi
or
self-
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
wouldn’t
you
agree
that
the
arguments
might
be
just
as
valid
so
to
take
the
self-defense
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
each
of
them
is
in
the
nature
at
least
in
broad
sense
in
the
nature
of
plea
of
confession
and
avoidance,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
in
that
nonsense
to
have
a
common
genesis
and
common
thread
of
logic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
colleague
in
other
case,
mr.
selvin
suggested
that
as
far
as
he
could
see,
there
was
no
constitutional
barrier
to
having
a
legislature
vest
in
the
judge
the
power
to
fix
the
sentence
without
standards
or
to
fix
a
mandatory
sentence.
do
you
have
a
view
on
that,
mr.
callahan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
know.
my
question
is
just
the
reversed,
vesting
the
power
of
imposing
the
death
sentence
in
the
judge
but
without
any
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
never
been
satisfied
as
to
the
value
or
utility
of
these
studies
which
are
done
because
of
the
difficulty
involved,
but
in
the
study
of
the
jury
function
by
professor
calvin
and
his
associates
of
the
university
of
chicago.
there
conclusion
was
that
judges
having
the
power
to
impose
the
death
sentence
imposed
that
exactly
twice
as
often
over
a
big
number
of
cases
as
juries
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
would
not
certainly
lead
defendant
as
to
want
to
move
this
out
of
juries
and
put
it
judges
really,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
callahan,
like
mr.
selvin,
you
acted
at
the
request
of
the
court

by
the

chief

the

arguments
in
the
first

number
203,
dennis
mcgautha

mr.
selvin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re

chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
selvin,
while
you’re
on

me
go

your

he
making
a

decision
in
your
view?
is
that
a
question
of

stand
in
most
cases
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ubut
you’re
not
suggesting
that
either
this
defendant
or
defendants
generally
in
capital
cases
would
take
the
stand
except
for
this
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that’s
just
another
way
of
saying
that
if
you
have
a
bifurcated
trial
he
has
nothing
to
lose
because
he
doesn’t
reach
the
second
stage
until
he
has
been
found
guilty
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
wherever
he
has
nowhere
to
go
except
to
prove
his
posture
that’s
the
reality
of
it
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
take
this
bifurcated
situation
whether
it’s
a
second
trial
on
penalty
only.
he
is
not
compelled
to
take
the
stand
is
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
states
in
the
cases
where
they
have
the
two-stage
trial
may
put
in
very
wide
range
of
evidence
adverse
to
him
factors
and
aggravation,
whether
he
takes
that
stand
or
whether
he
doesn’t.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
callahan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
have
you
answered
mr.
blackmun’s
question
yet
fully?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
one
more
question.
you
have
me
a
little
bit
confused
when
you
referred
to
a
separate
stage
trial
on
the
issue
of
criminal
responsibility
or
the
insanity
claim.
you
don’t
raise
that
as
the
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
callahan.
mr.
resnick,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
resnick.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
callahan,
you
have
10
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
not
the
criminal
responsibility
also
go
to
the
question
of
guilt
in
the
legal
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we,
california
at
least
bifurcates
that
trial
good
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
wouldn’t
be
very
remarkable
if
someone
would
build
on
the
analogy
of
bifurcated
trials
for
insanity
question
to
bifurcated
trial
for
alibi
or
self-
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
wouldn’t
you
agree
that
the
arguments
might
be
just
as
valid
so
to
take
the
self-defense
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
each
of
them
is
in
the
nature
at
least
in
broad
sense
in
the
nature
of
plea
of
confession
and
avoidance,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
in
that
nonsense
to
have
a
common
genesis
and
common
thread
of
logic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
colleague
in
other
case,
mr.
selvin
suggested
that
as
far
as
he
could
see,
there
was
no
constitutional
barrier
to
having
a
legislature
vest
in
the
judge
the
power
to
fix
the
sentence
without
standards
or
to
fix
a
mandatory
sentence.
do
you
have
a
view
on
that,
mr.
callahan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
know.
my
question
is
just
the
reversed,
vesting
the
power
of
imposing
the
death
sentence
in
the
judge
but
without
any
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
never
been
satisfied
as
to
the
value
or
utility
of
these
studies
which
are
done
because
of
the
difficulty
involved,
but
in
the
study
of
the
jury
function
by
professor
calvin
and
his
associates
of
the
university
of
chicago.
there
conclusion
was
that
judges
having
the
power
to
impose
the
death
sentence
imposed
that
exactly
twice
as
often
over
a
big
number
of
cases
as
juries
did.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
would
not
certainly
lead
defendant
as
to
want
to
move
this
out
of
juries
and
put
it
judges
really,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
callahan,
like
mr.
selvin,
you
acted
at
the
request
of
the
court
and
by
the
appointment
of
the
court.
we
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
the
petitioner
and
to
the
court
for
your
services.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
