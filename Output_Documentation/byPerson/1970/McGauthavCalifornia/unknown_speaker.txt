unknown
speaker
mr.
selvin,
how
long
has
california
had
a
statute
providing
for
the
bifurcated
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
under
california
procedure,
has
it
always
been
the
jury
which
fixes
the
punishment?
unknown
speaker
if
california
has
many
other
states,
had
a
procedure
whereby
punishment
was
fixed
by
the
judge,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here
today?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
as
i
understand
mr.
mcgautha’s
codefendant
received
a
life
sentence
from
the
jury
and
i
take
it
as
your
position
that
this
difference
in
the
imposition
of
penalty
is
indicative
of
depress
in
the
part
of
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
anyone
other
than
mcgautha
or
wilkinson
pulled
the
trigger?
unknown
speaker
does
california
or
do
other
states
have
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases?
unknown
speaker
in
case
like
that
vary,
and
supposing
that
the
range
of
punishment
is
5
to
15
years
were
dignified,
do
you
say
under
your
argument
that
the
jury
had
to
give
the
sentence
as
to
how
they
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
selvin,
one
more
question.
if
california
provided
that
upon
conviction
for
first-degree
murder
that
death
penalty
were
mandatory,
would
that
in
your
view
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
death
penalty
were
a
mandatory
and
were
not
unconstitutional,
then
you
are
here
because
california
is
more
lenient
than
it
might
have
to
be.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
along
the
jury
was
out
of
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
has
power
to
reverse
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
for
a
new
penalty
trial
alone
while
leaving
the
finding
of
conviction
--the
verdict
of
conviction
undisturbed.
we
know
that
as
you
told
us
from
many
cases
we’ve
seen
here.
does
it
also
have
power,
as
you
told
us
the
trial
judge
has
to
simply
reduce
the
sentence
in
that
method?
unknown
speaker
yet
the
supreme
court
should
reduce
it
to
a
lower
degree
of
homicide,
then
is
that
the
end
of
it
or
is
there
a
new
trial
on
penalty
or
a
new
trial
on
anything?
unknown
speaker
it’s
just
that
we
find
that
the
evidence
on
the
guilt
phase
was
not
sufficient
to
show
any,
whatever
it
is,
deliberation
or
premeditation
and
therefore
the
most
thing
he
can
guilty
of
is
second-degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
affirm
it
and
automatically
then
that
carries
the
sentence
of
what
one
year
to
life
or
whatever
it
is?
unknown
speaker
in
the
discretion
of
the
adult
authority
and
that’s
the
end
of
it
and
there’s
no
new
--
there
are
no
new
proceedings
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
the
defendant
doesn’t
get
another
shot
under
those
circumstances
for
a
new
trial
and
the
most
he
could
be
convicted
now
would
be
second-degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
yes.
when
the
supreme
court
said
the
evidence
in
this
case
doing
it
more
strongly
in
favor
of
the
prosecution
simply
does
not
show
a
case
of
first-degree
murder.
we
therefore
reduce
it
to
the
conviction
to
second-degree
murder
and
affirm
the
conviction,
is
that
what
they
do?
unknown
speaker
is
there
in
the
brief
on
the
other
side
showing
context
statement
is
what
standard
they
say
a
constitution
requires.
unknown
speaker
is
that
nearest
to
a
set
of
standards
that
have
been
proposed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
excuse
me,
has
california
had
a
bifurcated
trial
beginning
--
in
getting
a
jury
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
selvin,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
i
assume
you’ve
given
this
case
much
thought,
you
show
it
by
your
brief
and
you
told
us.
do
you
have
any
suggestion
as
to
standards
anymore
than
that
in
your
page
27,
note
19?
unknown
speaker
it’s
a
question
of
language,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
now
when
you
get
to
standards,
you
would
say,
why
is
that
applied?
unknown
speaker
you
were
just
telling
about
the
judge
in
case
of
the
murder.
premeditation,
you
said
you
would
have
told
them,
why
is
that
this?
what
would
you
suggest
that
the
judge
could
say
to
the
jury
why
is
that
this?
unknown
speaker
mr.
selvin,
although
we’re
pretty
late
in
the
argument
and
perhaps
i’m
obtuse,
or
i
missed
something
but
i
still
–
it’s
not
at
all
clear
to
me
what
your
concept
is
when
you
talk
about
standards?
i
just
know
an
answer
to
my
brother
black,
you
said
repeated
two
or
three
times
that
the
jury
should
be
told,
“this
is
what
you
ought
to
be
thinking
about
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impose
a
death
sentence.”
well,
that’s
one
kind
of
standard.
another,
quite
different
kind
and
it
is
different
in
kind,
not
in
degree
is
that
the
jury
must
be
told,
“you
may
not
sentence
this
man
to
death
unless
you
find
this
and
that
and
the
other
or
unless
you
find
the
absence
of
this
or
that
and
the
other.”
now,
those
are
two
quite
different
concepts
of
standards
and
i
don’
frankly
know
which
one
you’re
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don’t
mean
that
the
jury
should
just
merely
be
told,
“these
are
the
kind
of
things
you
ought
to
be
thinking
about.”
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
--
would
the
constitution
on
your
submission
be
satisfied
by
either
kind
of
standards?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
either
would
satisfy
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
so,
you’re
not
confining
yourself
to
either
one
concept
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
how
old
is
he?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
at
the
time
he
committed
this
crime.
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
is
that
included
in
the
ali
proposed
standards?
unknown
speaker
so,
it’s
not
a
necessary
part
of
the
set
of
standards.
unknown
speaker
may
i,
excuse
--
did
the
defendant
ask
any
instructions?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
you
can’t
ask
any
instructions
of
any
kind?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
you
gone
a
little
far
back.
it
really
begins
in
the
bottom
of
page
221
and
the
result
at
222
and
most
of
page
223
and
does
reflect
does
it
not
particularly
on
top
of
222,
the
cases
decided
by
your
supreme
court
which
the
states
have
mentioned
at
least
do
constitute
standards.
in
this
part
of
the
trial,
a
law
does
not
forbid
you
from
being
influenced
by
pity
for
the
defendants
and
you
may
be
governed
by
merely
sentiments
and
sympathy
for
the
defendants
in
arriving
at
a
proper
penalty
in
this
case.
however,
the
law
does
forbid
you
from
being
governed
by
mere
conjecture,
prejudice,
public
opinion,
or
public
feeling
and
so
on.
each
one
of
those
expressions
in
the
court’s
instructions
reflect
does
it
not
a
decided
case
by
your
supreme
court.
and
to
that
extent,
it
reflects
a
standard
if
you
want
to,
the
statute
states
and
that’s
what
they
are.
unknown
speaker
in
light
of
the
(inaudible)
did,
typify
the
allocution
right
as
of
constitutional
dimension?
unknown
speaker
and
that
your
position
that
under
the
situation
with
the
jury
fixes
punishment
that
is
totally
or
close
to
totally
meaningless?
unknown
speaker
how
many
states
have
the
unitary
system?
unknown
speaker
couldn’t
it
be
true
in
the
--
wouldn’t
that
be
true
in
the
regular
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
callahan
was
there
any
request
for
a
bifurcated
trial?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
in
your
study
of
this
case
that
you
are
able
to
tell
us
when
this
objection
that
you’re
making
was
first
made
to
this
kind
of
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
talking
about
your
case.
i’m
talking
about
when
anyone
after
the
adoption
of
our
constitution
first
raised
the
question
that
you’re
now
presenting
with
reference
to
coercion
on
account
of
this
kind
of
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
did
you
find
any
suggestion
before
that?
unknown
speaker
in
that
statement,
are
you
equating
the
right
of
allocution
with
the
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
does
any
case
state
or
federal
so
held?
unknown
speaker
mr.
callahan,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
as
i
understand
it,
this
record
contains
evidence
bearing
upon
the
defendant’s
sanity
or
alleged
insanity,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
this
not
in
itself
a
mitigating
to
a
degree
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
that
leads
me
to
my
next
question.
doesn’t
the
record
contain
already
evidence
as
to
his
alleged
addiction
and
his
prior
convictions?
unknown
speaker
well
then
what
prejudice
was
he
concerned
about
in
not
taking
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
your
general
argument,
i’m
trying
to
be
a
little
pragmatic
at
this
point
and
you
have
answered
to
my
inquiry
that
the
record
does
contain
already
evidences
to
his
prior
convictions.
it
already
contains
evidence
as
to
his
difficulty
with
drugs
and
it
already
contains
evidence
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
sanity
and
i
think
my
question
therefore
is
how
otherwise
as
a
practical
matter
would
if
he
had
been
prejudiced
by
taking
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
na
--
do
you
have
any
comment
about
the
spencer
against
tracy,
this
was
against
texas?
unknown
speaker
texas,
yes.
what
was
the
name
of
the
case
to
which
you
referred
me?
it
was
the
first
time
you’ve
seen
this
right
here?
unknown
speaker
versus
bishop?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
find
if
cited,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
i’m
disappointed.
unknown
speaker
now
that
i
have
my
characters
straightened
out,
it
is
spencer.
[laughter]
that
shows
that
i
do.
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
that
a
decision
in
your
favor
here
would
compel
an
overruling
of
spencer
against
texas?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
from
my
reading
of
the
history
of
the
bifurcated
trials
which
this
question
was
raised
before
legislature
long
before
that.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
earliest
legislative
action?
unknown
speaker
and
since
then
how
many
states?
unknown
speaker
mr.
selvin,
how
long
has
california
had
a
statute
providing
for
the
bifurcated
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
under
california
procedure,
has
it
always
been
the
jury
which
fixes
the
punishment?
unknown
speaker
if
california
has
many
other
states,
had
a
procedure
whereby
punishment
was
fixed
by
the
judge,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here
today?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
as
i
understand
mr.
mcgautha’s
codefendant
received
a
life
sentence
from
the
jury
and
i
take
it
as
your
position
that
this
difference
in
the
imposition
of
penalty
is
indicative
of
depress

of
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
anyone
other
than
mcgautha
or
wilkinson

one
more
question.
if

for

that
death

were
mandatory,
would
that
in
your
view
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
death
penalty
were
a
mandatory
and
were
not
unconstitutional,
then
you
are
here
because
california
is
more
lenient
than
it
might
have
to
be.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
along
the
jury
was
out
of
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
has
power
to

of
the
death
sentence
for
a

trial
alone
while
leaving

--the

of

we
know
that
as
you
told
us
from
many
cases
we’ve
seen
here.
does
it
also
have
power,
as
you
told
us
the
trial
judge
has
to
simply
reduce
the
sentence
in
that
method?
unknown

yet
the

should
reduce

to

then

for

and
the
most
he
could

yes.

well,
that’s
one

another,
quite

and
it

is
that

now,
those
are
two
quite

and
i
don’
frankly
know

you’re

about?

how
old
is
he?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
at
the
time
he
committed
this
crime.
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
is
that
included
in
the
ali
proposed
standards?
unknown
speaker
so,
it’s
not
a
necessary
part
of
the
set
of
standards.
unknown
speaker
may
i,
excuse
--
did
the
defendant
ask
any
instructions?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
you
can’t
ask
any
instructions
of
any
kind?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
you
gone
a
little
far
back.
it
really
begins
in
the
bottom
of
page
221
and
the
result
at
222
and
most
of
page
223
and
does
reflect
does
it
not
particularly
on
top
of
222,
the
cases
decided
by
your
supreme
court
which
the
states
have
mentioned
at
least
do
constitute
standards.
in
this
part
of
the
trial,
a
law
does
not
forbid
you
from
being
influenced
by
pity
for
the
defendants
and
you
may
be
governed
by
merely
sentiments
and
sympathy
for
the
defendants
in
arriving
at
a
proper
penalty
in
this
case.
however,
the
law
does
forbid
you
from
being
governed
by
mere
conjecture,
prejudice,
public
opinion,
or
public
feeling
and
so
on.
each
one
of
those
expressions
in
the
court’s
instructions
reflect
does
it
not
a
decided
case
by
your
supreme
court.
and
to
that
extent,
it
reflects
a
standard
if
you
want
to,
the
statute
states
and
that’s
what
they
are.
unknown
speaker
in
light
of
the
(inaudible)
did,
typify
the
allocution
right
as
of
constitutional
dimension?
unknown
speaker
and
that
your
position
that
under
the
situation
with
the
jury
fixes
punishment
that
is
totally
or
close
to
totally
meaningless?
unknown
speaker
how
many
states
have
the
unitary
system?
unknown
speaker
couldn’t
it
be
true
in
the
--
wouldn’t
that
be
true
in
the
regular
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
callahan
was
there
any
request
for
a
bifurcated
trial?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
in
your
study
of
this
case
that
you
are
able
to
tell
us
when
this
objection
that
you’re
making
was
first
made
to
this
kind
of
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
talking
about
your
case.
i’m
talking
about
when
anyone
after
the
adoption
of
our
constitution
first
raised
the
question
that
you’re
now
presenting
with
reference
to
coercion
on
account
of
this
kind
of
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
did
you
find
any
suggestion
before
that?
unknown
speaker
in
that
statement,
are
you
equating
the
right
of
allocution
with
the
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
does
any
case
state
or
federal
so
held?
unknown
speaker
mr.
callahan,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
as
i
understand
it,
this
record
contains
evidence
bearing
upon
the
defendant’s
sanity
or
alleged
insanity,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
this
not
in
itself
a
mitigating
to
a
degree
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
that
leads
me
to
my
next
question.
doesn’t
the
record
contain
already
evidence
as
to
his
alleged
addiction
and
his
prior
convictions?
unknown
speaker
well
then
what
prejudice
was
he
concerned
about
in
not
taking
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
your
general
argument,
i’m
trying
to
be
a
little
pragmatic
at
this
point
and
you
have
answered
to
my
inquiry
that
the
record
does
contain
already
evidences
to
his
prior
convictions.
it
already
contains
evidence
as
to
his
difficulty
with
drugs
and
it
already
contains
evidence
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
sanity
and
i
think
my
question
therefore
is
how
otherwise
as
a
practical
matter
would
if
he
had
been
prejudiced
by
taking
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
na
--
do
you
have
any
comment
about
the
spencer
against
tracy,
this
was
against
texas?
unknown
speaker
texas,
yes.
what
was
the
name
of
the
case
to
which
you
referred
me?
it
was
the
first
time
you’ve
seen
this
right
here?
unknown
speaker
versus
bishop?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
find
if
cited,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
i’m
disappointed.
unknown
speaker
now
that
i
have
my
characters
straightened
out,
it
is
spencer.
[laughter]
that
shows
that
i
do.
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
that
a
decision
in
your
favor
here
would
compel
an
overruling
of
spencer
against
texas?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
from
my
reading
of
the
history
of
the
bifurcated
trials
which
this
question
was
raised
before
legislature
long
before
that.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
earliest
legislative
action?
unknown
speaker
and
since
then
how
many
states?
