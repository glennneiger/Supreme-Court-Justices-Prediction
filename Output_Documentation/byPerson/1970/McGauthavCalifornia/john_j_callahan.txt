mr.
john
j.
callahan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
crampton
case
presents
a
similar
challenge
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
or
cases
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
under
the
ohio
procedure.
similar
to
mcgautha,
the
mcgautha
case
in
california,
we
decry
the
lack
of
standards
to
guide
a
jury
in
the
selection
of
its
penalties.
we
have
the
added
feature
in
ohio
of
contending
that
a
procedure
which
permits
a
jury
to
consider
and
determine
the
issues
of
guilt
and
punishment
in
a
single
proceeding
violates
the
defendant’s
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
be
free
from
self-incrimination.
the
statutes
involved
in
the
crampton
case
are
the
statute
which
defines
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
ohio
which
sets
up
the
felony
type
murders
and
the
necessity
of
deliberate
or
premeditated
malice
and
also
prescribes
the
punishment.
the
statute
says
that
the
punishment
is
death
unless
the
jury
recommends
mercy
in
which
event
the
punishment
is
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
for
life.
we
are
also
bringing
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
statute
which
provides
the
right
of
allocution
to
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
the
factual
context
of
the
crampton
situation
is
this.
james
crampton
was
a
man
approximately
40
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
this
incident,
and
he
had
been
married
to
wilma
crampton
approximately
four
months
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
in
november
of
1966,
shortly
after
the
couple
were
married,
crampton
admitted
himself
voluntarily
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
for
drug
addiction.
he
later
was
confined
under
the
court
order
of
the
probate
court
of
lucas
county,
ohio
to
the
toledo
state
hospital.
shortly
before
the
holidays
of
1966,
crampton
was
released
to
his
wife
wilma
on
a
trial
visit
by
the
state
hospital
authorities.
in
january
of
1967,
she
remonstrated
with
him
to
return
to
the
hospital.
he
refused
then
he
left
the
family
home.
he
remained
away
for
approximately
ten
days
to
two
weeks
during
which
time,
he
was
with
a
friend
whom
he
admit
in
pontiac,
michigan
and
traveled
throughout
the
ohio,
michigan
and
indiana
area
procuring
drugs
with
money
that
they
obtained
from
thefts
generally
in
motels.
on
january
17,
he
returned
to
toledo,
ohio
and
came
to
the
residence
of
his
wife
at
approximately
seven
o’clock
in
the
evening.
later
the
same
evening,
he
was
found
driving
a
stolen
car
in
the
streets
of
downtown
toledo
with
a
45
caliber
automatic
on
the
front
seat.
his
wife’s
body
was
discovered
the
following
morning
having
been
shot
through
the
head
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
45
caliber
automatic.
when
he
came
to
the
lucas
county
court,
he
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
to
the
charge
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
at
the
trial
of
his
case
before
a
jury,
he
did
not
testify.
he
supplied
in
order
to
support
his
plea
of
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity,
the
medical
records
from
the
hospitals
that
he
had
been
in
both
before
and
after
his
arrest,
and
also
his
mother
testified
on
his
behalf
with
reference
to
his
background.
the
jury
had
to
decide
at
a
single
seat
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
guilty
or
innocent,
whether
or
not
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime
or
possess
its
faculties
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
whether
his
punishment
should
be
life
imprisonment
or
death.
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
instructions
with
reference
to
the
guilt
or
the
insanity
issues
involved.
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
punishment
was,
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
this
appears
at
page
5
five
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
the
punishment
is
death
unless
you
recommend
mercy
in
which
event
the
punishment
is
imprisonment
during
the
penitentiary
for
life.
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
did
not
recommend
mercy
and
the
defendant
came
before
the
court
and
was
sentenced
to
death
by
electrocution
in
ohio.
his
appeal
to
the
ohio
courts,
the
judgment
of
the
lower
courts
have
been
upheld
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
the
standards
question
and
what
has
been
alluded
to
as
the
single
verdict
question.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
standards
question
has
been
treated
in
depth
to
this
point,
i
will
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
fifth
amendment
problem
as
it
arises
in
the
crampton
case.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
once
the
jury
in
ohio
imposes
the
penalty
of
death
it
cannot
be
modified
or
affected
by
the
trial
court
or
by
any
appellate
court
unless
there
is
a
legal
error
found
in
the
record
with
reference
to
the
conviction
and
if
the
conviction
falls
of
course
the
punishment
falls
with
it
but
the
sentence
of
death
in
and
of
itself
imposed
by
the
jury
is
absolutely
immune
at
all
stages
in
the
trial
and
appellate
procedure
in
ohio.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
do
indeed,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
crampton
contends
that
he
has
under
the
federal
constitution,
two
rights
involved
in
this
case.
one
is
the
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
second
is
the
right
if
he
is
found
guilty
of
the
charge
made
against
him
to
have
his
sentence
be
imposed
on
a
rational
basis.
we
contend
that
this
is
a
due
process
right
and
that
this
latter
right
includes
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
life
or
death
and
the
right
to
address
evidence
to
the
question
of
his
punishment,
address
evidence
to
his
sentence
under
the
ohio
unitary
trial
procedure
however,
there
is
a
dilemma
confronting
the
defendant
in
a
capital
case.
if
he
invokes
his
fifth
amendment
right,
the
jury
decides
his
punishment
without
ever
hearing
from
the
man
whose
life
they
hold
in
their
hands.
if
he
waives
his
fifth
amendment
right,
he
will
take
the
stand
and
subjects
himself
not
only
to
the
possibility
of
incriminating
himself
but
also
he
had
subject
to
impeachment
as
to
his
credibility
and
in
ohio
this
covers
a
great
range
of
inquiry
not
only
prior
convictions
for
felonies
and
statutory
misdemeanors
in
the
civilian
courts
and
in
the
military
courts,
he
can
be
queried
about
his
dishonorable
discharge
from
service,
any
changes
in
employment
and
indication
in
a
recent
cases
that
he
can
be
subject
to
impeachment
by
questioning
about
pending
indictments,
not
convictions
but
only
pending
indictments.
the
only
limitation
placed
upon
the
subject
by
the
courts
of
ohio
is
that
his
limitation
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
and
if
the
trial
court
does
not
abuse
this
discretion
and
it
clearly
shows
by
the
record
that
there
is
an
abusive
discretion,
there
is
no
error.
so
to
avoid
this
--
mr.
john
j.
callahan
under
the
ashbrook
case
in
ohio,
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
would
appear
that
the
question
of
punishment
is
not
an
issue
and
no
evidence
can
be
addressed
by
the
defendant
to
the
question
of
his
sentence.
he
must
only
go
and
present
evidence
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
his
responsibility
for
the
crime.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
your
honor.
not
directed
to
it
directly.
now,
i
will
admit
that
in
many
cases
in
ohio
and
i
think
this
is
in
one
of
the
opinions
written
by
the
honorable
chief
justice
at
an
earlier
time
indicated
that
in
many
cases
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
is
entered
and
many
mitigating
factors
directed
toward
the
sentencing
come
in,
in
an
indirect
fashion
under
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
whether
the
state’s
evidence
is
directed
to
the
issue
of
guilt
or
punishment
because
the
aggravating
factors
that
would
be
necessarily
involved
in
a
proving
the
crime
itself
would
also
be
directed
toward
the
punishment
phase
of
the
matter.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
not
unless
the
defendant
comes
on
to
stand
himself
or
subjects
his
character
or
reputation
to
inquiry
then
of
course
the
state
can
put
on
that
type
of
evidence.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir.
yes,
he
can
put
it
in.
it’s
possible
for
him
to
put
it
in.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that’s
correct,
but
there
is
incriminating
evidence
that
comes
in
with
this
psychiatric
testimony
or
testimony
of
the
psychiatric
type.
in
the
course
of
entering
these
hospitals,
a
full
and
complete
record
is
taken
with
respect
to
his
case
history.
if
he
has
been
involved
in
prior
criminal
incidents,
they
are
appearing
not
only
in
the
admission’s
report,
in
the
psychologist
report
and
many
times
in
the
findings
by
the
psychiatrist
and
he
is
when
he
submits
the
evidence
of
his
background
through
medical
records
off
times
incriminating
himself
vicariously
through
what
he
has
said
to
the
psychiatrist
at
an
earlier
occasion.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
doesn’t
necessarily,
no
sir.
it
would
be
difficult
however
to
try
a
case
in
front
of
the
jury
and
attempt
to
block
part
of
the
medical
records
from
a
technical
standpoint
to
deprive
the
jury
of
some
part
of
the
medical
record
when
you
are
submitting
the
others
for
their
examination.
so
there
is
a
certain
compulsion
to
submit
to
the
jury
the
entire
medical
record
and
when
there
is
this
evidence
in
it.
when
the
defendant
crampton
was
confronted
with
the
dilemma
in
the
present
case,
he
elected
to
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
he
thereby
surrendered
his
right
to
address
the
jury
who
is
in
effect
the
sentencer
in
this
case
on
the
right
of
his
punishment.
now
the
statute
in
ohio,
with
reference
to
allocution
is
a
mandatory
statute
so
held
by
our
supreme
court
and
we
go
through
the
ritual
in
ohio
of
bringing
the
defendant
before
the
court
in
a
capital
case
after
he
has
been
found
guilty
without
a
recommendation
of
mercy
by
the
jury
and
asking
him
if
he
has
anything
to
say
as
to
why
sentence
should
not
be
imposed
upon
him.
the
court
is
not
the
sentencer
in
this
case.
it
merely
imposing
the
verdict
on
the
basis
of
the
mandatory
allocution
statute
he
has
asked
this
but
the
statute
is
meaningless
totally
meaningless
in
the
cases
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
but
even
--
where
a
death
penalty
has
been
imposed.
now,
if
you
can
conceive
of
a
situation
wherein
the
judge
asks
the
question,
“do
you
have
anything
to
say
why
judgment
should
not
be
imposed
against
you”
and
a
reason
where
to
be
advanced
by
the
defendant
in
this
hypothetical
situation.
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
could
modify
or
in
any
way
reach
the
sentence
that
has
been
imposed
by
the
jury
to
amend
it.
it’s
totally
insulated
under
the
laws
of
ohio
once
the
jury
has
made
this
decision.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
has
not
your
honor,
its
statutory
right
in
ohio
and
the
ohio
court
has
said
that
it
is
a
mandatory
right
to
be
accorded
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor
because
the
judge
is
not
the
sentencer.
the
jury
is
the
sentencer
in
the
capital
case
and
if
allocution
is
to
have
any
meaning,
the
meaning
that
the
legislature
intended
for
it,
since
it
is
a
mandatory
statute
it
should
permit
the
defendant
to
address
the
sentencer
the
actual
sentencer
and
not
the
man
who
merely
echoes
the
words
or
the
findings
of
the
jury.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
believe,
your
honor
that
if
under
the
due
process
clause,
that
this
court
has
said
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
matter
of
his
punishment.
in
specht
versus
patterson
and
on
mempa
versus
rhay,
that
i
feel
that
the
matter
of
allocution
in
a
capital
case
rises
to
a
constitutional
level
because
there
is
more
involved
in
a
capital
case
allocution
than
there
is
involved
in
the
case
of
the
ordinary
crime
where
the
judgment
is
for
a
term
of
years.
here,
it’s
a
matter
or
life
or
death.
here
is
the
one
place
under
the
constitution
where
the
right
of
allocution
should
rise
to
the
requirement
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
we
are
aware
that
it
is
in
ohio
a
statutory
right
that
it
must
be
accorded
to
the
defendant,
and
we
are
asking
this
court
for
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
whether
or
not
the
right
in
a
capital
case
rises
to
a
constitutional
level.
the
--
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
that
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
defendant’s
background
and
the
other
factors
that
he
would
wish
to
get
before
the
jury
may
be
supplied
by
others
other
than
the
defendant.
for
instance
in
the
present
case,
the
mother
of
the
defendant
testified.
but
i
don’t
believe
that
the
problem
that
we
face
is
cured
by
the
testimony
of
others
because
the
jury
during
the
course
of
the
trial
sees
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
each
day
hears
the
testimony
of
others
with
respect
to
his
background
and
never
hears
from
him
because
he
has
invoked
his
fifth
amendment
right.
and
i
think
that
the
jury
--
the
individual
jurors
are
inclined
to
draw
inferences
from
the
fact
that
he
did
not
testify
and
that
if
he
does
not
testify
particularly
in
a
case
where
he
has
pleaded
not
guilty,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
if
they
do
not
hear
from
him,
the
inference
is
that
he
is
hiding
something
and
that
in
their
punishment
phase
they
can
punish
him
for
not
being
full,
free,
fair
and
candid
with
them.
it
is
the
sort
of
a
priscilla

of
why
don’t
you
speak
for
yourself?
why
come
in
with
these

have

testify
about
what
you
could
tell
us
much
better?

is
coerced
by
the
unitary
trial
system
in
ohio.
he
is
compelled
to
select
one
of
the
rights
either
the
right
to
avoid
incriminating
himself
or
the
right
to
allocution
because
he
fears
the
consequences
that
may
come
from
selecting
the
other.
in
this
case,
his
choice
was
not
a
completely
free
one
and
this
compulsion
is
induced
by
the
system
that
prevails
in
ohio.
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
choice
of
rights
is
no
more
than
a
dilemma
that
confronts
any
criminal
defendant
as
to
the
matter
of
his
trial
tactics
or
trial
strategy.
but
we
would
submit
to
this
court
that
in
making
this
selection,
it
is
far
more
than
a
selection
of
trial
tactics
or
a
choice
trial
tactics.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
laid
his
life
on
the
line
in
making
this
selection.
he
knows
as
he
goes
into
the
trial
that
the
jury
will
be
informed
and
instructed
on
what
to
consider
and
what
not
to
consider
on
the
issue
of
its
guilt.
but
on
the
issue
of
his
punishment,
he
knows
that
they
may
condemn
him
to
death
for
any
reason
for
12
different
reasons
or
for
no
reason
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
would
be
your
honor
that
he
would.
and
looking
at
the
issue
of
punishment,
there
is
no
instruction
with
respect
to
punishment
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
jury
is
merely
told
as
they
were
in
the
crampton
case
that
they
had
to
decide
after
he
was
found
guilty
if
they
found
him
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
whether
or
not
they
should
recommend
mercy.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
would
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
there
are
an
unlimited
number
of
other
factors
in
addition
to
the
death
penalty
in
this
cases
but
the
capital
--
the
reason
of
paramount
importance.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
because
of
the
capital
case,
[voice
overlap].
yes
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
most
if
not
all
yes
and
but
in
the
capital
case,
we
submit
there
is
a
distinction
because
of
the
punishment
involved
and
because
of
the
manner
in
which
that
punishment
is
meted
out
in
ohio.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
choice
that
the
defendant
makes
in
a
capital
case
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
if
he
were
aware
that
he
could
address
his
sentence
or
on
the
matter
he
would
be
more
inclined
to
take
the
stand
in
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial
similar
to
california
which
we
do
not
have
in
the
ohio
case,
if
i
understand
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it’s
true
but
it’s
also
a
possibility
that
is
in
a
bifurcated
trial
is
has
the
penalty
phase
could
work
against
him
permitting
the
state
to
introduce
evidence
of
aggravation.
now
his
character
and
reputation
are
at
issue
and
but
they’re
not
at
issue
in
the
guilt
phase
unless
he
puts
them
at
issue.
so
i
submit
that
the
difference
is
that
when
he
makes
the
selection,
he
is
considering
its
point.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir.
not
under
the
present
procedures
of
which
i’m
aware.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
agree.
and
there’s
that
possibility
but
it
has
when
you
consider
that
that
evidence
cannot
be
introduced
by
the
state
in
a
single
trial,
unless
the
defendant
puts
it
into
issue
himself
then
the
defendant’s
choice
in
avoiding
the
testimony
and
avoiding
getting
under
the
stand
gives
him
the
--
deprives
him
of
the
opportunity
to
discuss
this
matter
of
punishment
with
the
people
who
actually
are
going
to
decide
whether
he
lives
or
dies.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
there
was
no
request
made
in
this
case,
your
honor.
subsequent
to
this
case
there
have
been
requests
for
bifurcated
trials
made
by
the
defendants
in
ohio.
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
it
has
been
granted
a
motion
made
prior
to
trial
by
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
objection
was
made
by
the
defendant
on
filing
his
application.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
first
instance
that
i
know
of
in
my
study
of
this
case,
your
honor
is
the
case
of
maxwell
versus
bishop
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
1968
term,
i
believe.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir
i
did
not.
this
procedure
of
ohio,
it
forces
the
defendant
to
make
his
selection
between
these
two
rights
is
we
claim
similar
to
the
procedure
that
was
condemned
by
this
court
in
the
simmons
case
that
in
a
constitutional
right
should
not
have
to
be
surrendered
in
order
to
assert
another
constitutional
right.
we
submit
that
the
ohio
single
verdict
procedure
compels
this
type
of
a
surrender.
the
procedure
also
imposes
--
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
am,
sir.
the
right
of
allocution
--
the
right
to
offer
evidence
on
the
question
of
his
punishment
and
the
right
to
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
his
sentencer,
i
submit
is
a
right
guaranteed
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
only
cases
that
we
refer
to
as
supporting
this
contention
your
honor
are
the
cases
of
specht
versus
patterson
and
mempa
versus
rhay.
this
court
has
also
considered
the
burdens
that
are
placed
upon
the
assertion
of
a
constitutional
right
in
united
states
versus
jackson
and
in
crampton
we
contend
that
there
is
a
impermissible
burden
placed
upon
the
defendants
exercise
of
his
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
in
violation
of
this
court’s
holding
in
the
jackson
case.
the
procedure
in
ohio
has
the
quality
of
needlessly
encouraging
a
waiver
of
this
fifth
amendment
right
if
he
wishes
to
talk
to
the
jury
and
it
needlessly
chills
the
right
to
present
evidence
on
the
question
of
punishment
relevant
to
his
rational
sentencing.
the
court
under
the
united
states
constitution
has
held
that
the
defendant
need
not
do
anything
to
defend
himself
against
a
charge
brought
against
him
but
it
has
likewise
observe
that
he
certainly
cannot
be
required
to
help
convict
himself.
we
submit
that
the
ohio
procedure
requires
that
he
help
convict
himself
and
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
for
that
reason.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
is
to
a
certain
extent.
however,
introducing
the
medical
records
to
support
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
the
defendant
had
to
take
another
calculated
risk
as
to
its
trial
tactics
because
in
those
records
was
contained
his
prior
criminal
record
which
he
had
told
the
admissions
officer
and
the
doctors
and
the
psychiatrists
at
the
hospitals
from
which
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
prejudice
of
incriminating
himself,
the
possibility
of
incriminating
himself
in
this
case
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment,
the
basic
contention
is
that
the
jury
having
at
one
seating
to
consider
guilt
or
innocence,
sanity
or
insanity,
and
punishment
either
death
or
life
is
a
procedure
that
compels
the
defendant
to
make
certain
choices
which
are
needlessly
made
which
he
does
not
have
to
make
if
there
were
a
bifurcated
trial,
if
there
were
judge
sentencing
or
review
of
the
sentence
by
judges
in
ohio
or
if
the
death
penalty
were
abolished.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
he
would
be
subjecting
himself
to
by
the
state’s
questions
to
testimony
about
the
crime
itself,
the
prejudice
is
in
the
--
in
incriminating
himself.
he
would
be
in
effect
helping
the
state
to
convict
himself
--
convict
him
of
his
crime.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
spencer,
against
texas?
mr.
john
j.
callahan
maxwell
versus
bishop,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
maxwell
versus
bishop
which
was
--
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
do
not
believe
it
was
cited.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
was
on
the
--
decided
by
this
court
during
the
last
term.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
this
was.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
with
reference
to
spencer
versus
texas,
the
syllabus
report
being
made
available
to
the
jury
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
case
prior
their
consideration
of
the
crime.
the
only
manner
in
which
we
can
distinguish
that
case
your
honor
is
that
the
--
this
was
if
i
recall
not
a
capital
case
and
i
would
feel
that
there
would
be
a
great
deal
more
concerned
about
the
defendant’s
right
to
speak
to
a
jury
or
the
right
of
records
coming
in,
in
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
right
in
a
capital
case.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir.
i
do
not
raise
that
as
a
constitutional
question.
i’m
merely
contending
that
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
his
guilt
and
an
opportunity
to
address
his
sentencer
on
the
issue
of
his
punishment.
the
trifurcated
trial
with
the
california
problem,
we
are
not
saying
in
our
submission
is
a
constitutional
matter.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
not
repeat
what
has
been
said
generally
with
respects
to
standards
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
ohio
as
it
has
been
suggested
in
a
couple
of
briefs
filed
in
this
case
could
be
considered
to
have
a
standard
cited
on
page
20
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
is
the
case
of
howell
versus
state
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
was
error
--
not
error
to
charge
the
jury
in
the
capital
case
“to
consider
and
determine
whether
or
not
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
and
facts
leading
up
to
and
attending
the
alleged
homicide
as
disclosed
by
the
evidence
you
should
or
should
not
make
such
recommendation
of
mercy.”
i
will
submit
that
that
is
merely
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
they
should
consider
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
it
may
be
a
standard.
but
if
not
an
adequate
standard
and
it
was
not
given
in
the
crampton
case,
the
only
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
that
is
other,
that
is
the
seated
jury,
the
12
people
appears
at
page
5
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
on
the
first
degree
the
punishment
is
death
unless
you
recommend
mercy
in
which
case
it
is
life.
but
the
instruction
goes
on
and
is
diametrically
opposed
to
the
instruction
which
follow
the
penalty
trial
in
california
and
the
instruction
which
appears
at
page
6
of
the
brief
says
you
must
not
be
influenced
by
any
considerations
of
sympathy
or
prejudice.
i
submit
that
when
you
tell
the
jury
that
one
of
the
things
that
must
not
consider
is
sympathy,
you
have
effectively
stopped
any
argument
by
the
defendant
for
mercy
in
the
case.
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
the
single
verdict
trial,
the
bifurcated
trial
would
be
available
also
to
a
defendant.
in
cases
of
self-defense
defenses
or
in
case
of
alibi
defenses,
the
distinction
that
i
would
point
out
with
reference
to
those
two
observations
is
that
both
of
this
matters
self-defense
and
alibi
relate
to
the
question
of
the
defendants
guilt.
they
do
not
go
to
the
question
of
his
punishment.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
submit
that
it
could
be
argued
that
way,
your
honor
but
it
is
not
part
of
the
submission
in
this
case
that
we
require
a
--
that
they
require
a
bifurcated
trial
under
self-
defense
and
alibi.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
don’t
think
that
they
could
be
just
as
valid
as
the
insanity
argument.
the
insanity
plea
has
been
--
is
a
different
type
of
plea
involving
a
certain
admission
by
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct
but
to
say
that
--
they
do
not
however,
self-defense
or
insanity
or
alibi
relate
directly
to
the
question
of
punishment
and
what
we
are
contending
in
this
case
is
that
the
bifurcated
trial
should
permit
the
defendant
after
he
has
been
found
guilty
and
responsible
to
address
the
sentencer
on
the
question
of
his
punishment.
the
trilogy
of
guilty
plea
decisions
made
by
this
court
last
term,
i
believe
can
be
effectively
distinguished
from
the
crampton
case
as
the
crampton
case
--
in
crampton,
he
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
stood
on
that
plea
throughout.
whereas
the
cases
decided
by
the
court
in
the
last
term
the
brady,
mcmann
and
parker
cases
involved
originally
a
guilty
plea.
a
concession
by
the
defendant
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
crime.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
argued,
the
decision
of
the
ohio
courts
should
be
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
for
determination
with
respect
to
punishment.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
i
don’t
do
see
no
constitutional
barrier
for
prohibiting
the
legislature
from
fixing
standards
for
the
judge.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
oh!
i
would
have
to
let
go
somewhat
of
mr.
selvin
said
in
his
case.
the
judge
is
in
effect
a
professional
sentencer
by
his
training,
by
his
expertise
that
he
and
his
background
he
brings
a
certain
criteria
to
a
case.
and
i
think,
it’s
the
essence
of
the
judgeship
that
he
should
not
have
to
have
standards
imposed
by
the
legislature.
it
is
only
for
the
layman
who
sees
--
who
seats
at
one
time
and
is
in
effect
an
ad
hoc
legislature
on
the
question
of
the
punishment
in
the
case
that
we
need
standards
to
guide
them.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
recall
it
conclusion
on
the
calvin
reports.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no
sir
not
that
conclusion.
they
--
with
reference
to
the
problem
of
standards,
there
appears
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
at
page
21
probably
the
best
evidence
with
respect
to
the
necessity
for
standards
where
a
foreman
of
a
jury
comes
before
the
court
and
asks
the
court
what
criteria?
what
are
the
grounds
for
granting
mercy
in
the
case
and
there
is
a
colloquy
there
between
the
judge
and
the
foreman
of
the
jury
that
betrays
the
jury’s
curiosity
as
to
the
standards
necessary
for
the
granting
of
mercy.
even
to
the
point
where
they
want
to
consider
the
sociological
and
environmental
factors
in
it
and
it’s
possible
that
these
standards
should
not
be
as
detailed
as
the
standards
in
the
model
penal
code
but
there
should
be
some
guidelines
given
to
the
jury
so
that
they
could
move
ahead
on
this
question
of
standards
with
guidelines
rather
than
operate
in
the
vacuum
as
they
appear
to
be
doing
in
caldwell
case
which
we
have
cited.
accordingly,
i
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
crampton
case
presents
a
similar
challenge
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
or
cases
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
under
the
ohio
procedure.
similar
to
mcgautha,
the
mcgautha
case
in
california,
we
decry
the
lack
of
standards
to
guide
a
jury
in
the
selection
of
its
penalties.
we
have
the
added
feature
in
ohio
of
contending
that
a
procedure
which
permits
a
jury
to
consider
and
determine
the
issues
of
guilt
and
punishment
in
a
single
proceeding
violates
the
defendant’s
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
be
free
from
self-incrimination.
the
statutes
involved
in
the
crampton
case
are
the
statute
which
defines
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
ohio
which
sets
up
the
felony
type
murders
and
the
necessity
of
deliberate
or
premeditated
malice
and
also
prescribes
the
punishment.
the
statute
says
that
the
punishment
is
death
unless
the
jury
recommends
mercy
in
which
event
the
punishment
is
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
for
life.
we
are
also
bringing
to
the
attention
of
the
court
the
statute
which
provides
the
right
of
allocution
to
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
the
factual
context
of
the
crampton
situation
is
this.
james
crampton
was
a
man
approximately
40
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
this
incident,
and
he
had
been
married
to
wilma
crampton
approximately
four
months
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
in
november
of
1966,
shortly
after
the
couple
were
married,
crampton
admitted
himself
voluntarily
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
for
drug
addiction.
he
later
was
confined
under
the
court
order
of
the
probate
court
of
lucas
county,
ohio
to
the
toledo
state
hospital.
shortly
before
the
holidays
of
1966,
crampton
was
released
to
his
wife
wilma
on
a
trial
visit
by
the
state
hospital
authorities.
in
january
of
1967,
she
remonstrated
with
him
to
return
to
the
hospital.
he
refused
then
he
left
the
family
home.
he
remained
away
for
approximately
ten
days
to
two
weeks
during
which
time,
he
was
with
a
friend
whom
he
admit
in
pontiac,
michigan
and
traveled
throughout
the
ohio,
michigan
and
indiana
area
procuring
drugs
with
money
that
they
obtained
from
thefts
generally
in
motels.
on
january
17,
he
returned
to
toledo,
ohio
and
came
to
the
residence
of
his
wife
at
approximately
seven
o’clock
in
the
evening.
later
the
same
evening,
he
was
found
driving
a
stolen
car
in
the
streets
of
downtown
toledo
with
a
45
caliber
automatic
on
the
front
seat.
his
wife’s
body
was
discovered
the
following
morning
having
been
shot
through
the
head
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
45
caliber
automatic.
when
he
came
to
the
lucas
county
court,
he
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
to
the
charge
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
at
the
trial
of
his
case
before
a
jury,
he
did
not
testify.
he
supplied
in
order
to
support
his
plea
of
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity,
the
medical
records
from
the
hospitals
that
he
had
been
in
both
before
and
after
his
arrest,
and
also
his
mother
testified
on
his
behalf
with
reference
to
his
background.
the
jury
had
to
decide
at
a
single
seat
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
guilty
or
innocent,
whether
or
not
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime
or
possess
its
faculties
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
whether
his
punishment
should
be
life
imprisonment
or
death.
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
instructions
with
reference
to
the
guilt
or
the
insanity
issues
involved.
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
punishment
was,
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
this
appears
at
page
5
five
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
the
punishment
is
death
unless
you
recommend
mercy
in
which
event
the
punishment
is
imprisonment
during
the
penitentiary
for
life.
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
did
not
recommend
mercy
and
the
defendant
came
before
the
court
and
was
sentenced
to
death
by
electrocution
in
ohio.
his
appeal
to
the
ohio
courts,
the
judgment
of
the
lower
courts
have
been
upheld
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
the
standards
question
and
what
has
been
alluded
to
as
the
single
verdict
question.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
standards
question
has
been
treated
in
depth
to
this
point,
i
will
address
myself
first
to
the
question
of
fifth
amendment
problem
as
it
arises
in
the
crampton
case.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
once
the
jury
in
ohio
imposes
the
penalty
of
death
it
cannot
be
modified
or
affected
by
the
trial
court
or
by
any
appellate
court
unless
there
is
a
legal
error
found
in
the
record
with
reference
to
the
conviction
and
if
the
conviction
falls
of
course
the
punishment
falls
with
it
but
the
sentence
of
death
in
and
of
itself
imposed
by
the
jury
is
absolutely
immune
at
all
stages
in
the
trial
and
appellate
procedure
in
ohio.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
do
indeed,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
crampton
contends
that
he
has
under
the
federal
constitution,
two
rights
involved
in
this
case.
one
is
the
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
second
is
the
right
if
he
is
found
guilty
of
the
charge
made
against
him
to
have
his
sentence
be
imposed
on
a
rational
basis.
we
contend
that
this
is
a
due
process
right
and
that
this
latter
right
includes
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
life
or
death
and
the
right
to
address
evidence
to
the
question
of
his
punishment,
address
evidence
to
his
sentence
under
the
ohio
unitary
trial
procedure
however,
there
is
a
dilemma
confronting
the
defendant
in
a
capital
case.
if
he
invokes
his
fifth
amendment
right,
the
jury
decides
his
punishment
without
ever
hearing
from
the
man
whose
life
they
hold
in
their
hands.
if
he
waives
his
fifth
amendment
right,
he
will
take
the
stand
and
subjects
himself
not
only
to
the
possibility
of
incriminating
himself
but
also
he
had
subject
to
impeachment
as
to
his
credibility
and
in
ohio
this
covers
a
great
range
of
inquiry
not
only
prior
convictions
for
felonies
and
statutory
misdemeanors
in
the
civilian
courts
and
in
the
military
courts,
he
can
be
queried
about
his
dishonorable
discharge
from
service,
any
changes
in
employment
and
indication
in
a
recent
cases
that
he
can
be
subject
to
impeachment
by
questioning
about
pending
indictments,
not
convictions
but
only
pending
indictments.
the
only
limitation
placed
upon
the
subject
by
the
courts
of
ohio
is
that
his
limitation
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
and
if
the
trial
court
does
not
abuse
this
discretion
and
it
clearly
shows
by
the
record
that
there
is
an
abusive
discretion,
there
is
no
error.
so
to
avoid
this
--
mr.
john
j.
callahan
under
the
ashbrook
case
in
ohio,
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
would
appear
that
the
question
of
punishment
is
not
an
issue
and
no
evidence
can
be
addressed
by
the
defendant
to
the
question
of
his
sentence.
he
must
only
go
and
present
evidence
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
his
responsibility
for
the
crime.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
your
honor.
not
directed
to
it
directly.
now,
i
will
admit
that
in
many
cases
in
ohio
and
i
think
this
is
in
one
of
the
opinions
written
by
the
honorable
chief
justice
at
an
earlier
time
indicated
that
in
many
cases
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
is
entered
and
many
mitigating
factors
directed
toward
the
sentencing
come
in,
in
an
indirect
fashion
under
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
whether
the
state’s
evidence
is
directed
to
the
issue
of
guilt
or
punishment
because
the
aggravating
factors
that
would
be
necessarily
involved
in
a
proving
the
crime
itself
would
also
be
directed
toward
the
punishment
phase
of
the
matter.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
not
unless
the
defendant
comes
on
to
stand
himself
or
subjects
his
character
or
reputation
to
inquiry
then
of
course
the
state
can
put
on
that
type
of
evidence.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir.
yes,
he
can
put
it
in.
it’s
possible
for
him
to
put
it
in.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that’s
correct,
but
there
is
incriminating
evidence
that
comes
in
with
this
psychiatric
testimony
or
testimony
of
the
psychiatric
type.
in
the
course
of
entering
these
hospitals,
a
full
and
complete
record
is
taken
with
respect
to
his
case
history.
if
he
has
been
involved
in
prior
criminal
incidents,
they
are
appearing
not
only
in
the
admission’s
report,
in
the
psychologist
report
and
many
times
in
the
findings
by
the
psychiatrist
and
he
is
when
he
submits
the
evidence
of
his
background
through
medical
records
off
times
incriminating
himself
vicariously
through
what
he
has
said
to
the
psychiatrist
at
an
earlier
occasion.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
doesn’t
necessarily,
no
sir.
it
would
be
difficult
however
to
try
a
case
in
front
of
the
jury
and
attempt
to
block
part
of
the
medical
records
from
a
technical
standpoint
to
deprive
the
jury
of
some
part
of
the
medical
record
when
you
are
submitting
the
others
for
their
examination.
so
there
is
a
certain
compulsion
to
submit
to
the
jury
the
entire
medical
record
and
when
there
is
this
evidence
in
it.
when
the
defendant
crampton
was
confronted
with
the
dilemma
in
the
present
case,
he
elected
to
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
he
thereby
surrendered
his
right
to
address
the
jury
who
is
in
effect
the
sentencer
in
this
case
on
the
right
of
his
punishment.
now
the
statute
in
ohio,
with
reference
to
allocution
is
a
mandatory
statute
so
held
by
our
supreme
court
and
we
go
through
the
ritual
in
ohio
of
bringing
the
defendant
before
the
court
in
a
capital
case
after
he
has
been
found
guilty
without
a
recommendation
of
mercy
by
the
jury
and
asking
him
if
he
has
anything
to
say
as
to
why
sentence
should
not
be
imposed
upon
him.
the
court
is
not
the
sentencer
in
this
case.
it
merely
imposing
the
verdict
on
the
basis
of
the
mandatory
allocution
statute
he
has
asked
this
but
the
statute
is
meaningless
totally
meaningless
in
the
cases
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
but
even
--
where
a
death
penalty
has
been
imposed.
now,
if
you
can
conceive
of
a
situation
wherein
the
judge
asks
the
question,
“do
you
have
anything
to
say
why
judgment
should
not
be
imposed
against
you”
and
a
reason
where
to
be
advanced
by
the
defendant
in
this
hypothetical
situation.
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
could
modify
or
in
any
way
reach
the
sentence
that
has
been
imposed
by
the
jury
to
amend
it.
it’s
totally
insulated
under
the
laws
of
ohio
once
the
jury
has
made
this
decision.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
has
not
your
honor,
its
statutory
right
in
ohio
and
the
ohio
court
has
said
that
it
is
a
mandatory
right
to
be
accorded
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor
because
the
judge
is
not
the
sentencer.
the
jury
is
the
sentencer
in
the
capital
case
and
if
allocution
is
to
have
any
meaning,
the
meaning
that
the
legislature
intended
for
it,
since
it
is
a
mandatory
statute
it
should
permit
the
defendant
to
address
the
sentencer
the
actual
sentencer
and
not
the
man
who
merely
echoes
the
words
or
the
findings
of
the
jury.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
believe,
your
honor
that
if
under
the
due
process
clause,
that
this
court
has
said
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
matter
of
his
punishment.
in
specht
versus
patterson
and
on
mempa
versus
rhay,
that
i
feel
that
the
matter
of
allocution
in
a
capital
case
rises
to
a
constitutional
level
because
there
is
more
involved
in
a
capital
case
allocution
than
there
is
involved
in
the
case
of
the
ordinary
crime
where
the
judgment
is
for
a
term
of
years.
here,
it’s
a
matter
or
life
or
death.
here
is
the
one
place
under
the
constitution
where
the
right
of
allocution
should
rise
to
the
requirement
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
we
are
aware
that
it
is
in
ohio
a
statutory
right
that
it
must
be
accorded
to
the
defendant,
and
we
are
asking
this
court
for
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
whether
or
not
the
right
in
a
capital
case
rises
to
a
constitutional
level.
the
--
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
that
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
defendant’s
background
and
the
other
factors
that
he
would
wish
to
get
before
the
jury
may
be
supplied
by
others
other
than
the
defendant.
for
instance
in
the
present
case,
the
mother
of
the
defendant
testified.
but
i
don’t
believe
that
the
problem
that
we
face
is
cured
by
the
testimony
of
others
because
the
jury
during
the
course
of
the
trial
sees
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
each
day
hears
the
testimony
of
others
with
respect
to
his
background
and
never
hears
from
him
because
he
has
invoked
his
fifth
amendment
right.
and
i
think
that
the
jury
--
the
individual
jurors
are
inclined
to
draw
inferences
from
the
fact
that
he
did
not
testify
and
that
if
he
does
not
testify
particularly
in
a
case
where
he
has
pleaded
not
guilty,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
if
they
do
not
hear
from
him,
the
inference
is
that
he
is
hiding
something
and
that
in
their
punishment
phase
they
can
punish
him
for
not
being
full,
free,
fair
and
candid
with
them.
it
is
the
sort
of
a
priscilla

syndrome
of
why
don’t
you
speak
for
yourself?
why
come
in
with
these
other
witnesses
to
have
them
testify
about
what
you
could
tell
us
much
better?

the
system

system,

the
petitioner
crampton
in
this
case
when
he
was
confronted
at
the
outset
of
his
trial
with
the
dilemma
as
to
his
rights
shows
to
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
because
he
feared
that
if
he
feared
that
if
he
tried
to
address
his
sentencer,
the
jury
in
this
case,
he
would
subject
himself
to
the
broad
range
of
impeachment
and
inquiries
and
also
subject
himself
to
incriminating
cross-examination.
this
selection
is
coerced
by
the
unitary
trial
system
in
ohio.
he
is
compelled
to
select
one
of
the
rights
either
the
right
to
avoid
incriminating
himself
or
the
right
to
allocution
because
he
fears
the
consequences
that
may
come
from
selecting
the
other.
in
this
case,
his
choice
was
not
a
completely
free
one
and
this
compulsion
is
induced
by
the
system
that
prevails
in
ohio.
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
choice
of
rights
is
no
more
than
a
dilemma
that
confronts
any
criminal
defendant
as
to
the
matter
of
his
trial
tactics
or
trial
strategy.
but
we
would
submit
to
this
court
that
in
making
this
selection,
it
is
far
more
than
a
selection
of
trial
tactics
or
a
choice
trial
tactics.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
laid
his
life
on
the
line
in
making
this
selection.
he
knows
as
he
goes
into
the
trial
that
the
jury
will
be
informed
and
instructed
on
what
to
consider
and
what
not
to
consider
on
the
issue
of
its
guilt.
but
on
the
issue
of
his
punishment,
he
knows
that
they
may
condemn
him
to
death
for
any
reason
for
12
different
reasons
or
for
no
reason
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
would
be
your
honor
that
he
would.
and
looking
at
the
issue
of
punishment,
there
is
no
instruction
with
respect
to
punishment
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
jury
is
merely
told
as
they
were
in
the
crampton
case
that
they
had
to
decide
after
he
was
found
guilty
if
they
found
him
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
whether
or
not
they
should
recommend
mercy.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
would
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
there
are
an
unlimited
number
of
other
factors
in
addition
to
the
death
penalty
in
this
cases
but
the
capital
--
the
reason
of
paramount
importance.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
because
of
the
capital
case,
[voice
overlap].
yes
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
most
if
not
all
yes
and
but
in
the
capital
case,
we
submit
there
is
a
distinction
because
of
the
punishment
involved
and
because
of
the
manner
in
which
that
punishment
is
meted
out
in
ohio.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
choice
that
the
defendant
makes
in
a
capital
case
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
if
he
were
aware
that
he
could
address
his
sentence
or
on
the
matter
he
would
be
more
inclined
to
take
the
stand
in
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial
similar
to
california
which
we
do
not
have
in
the
ohio
case,
if
i
understand
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it’s
true
but
it’s
also
a
possibility
that
is
in
a
bifurcated
trial
is
has
the
penalty
phase
could
work
against
him
permitting
the
state
to
introduce
evidence
of
aggravation.
now
his
character
and
reputation
are
at
issue
and
but
they’re
not
at
issue
in
the
guilt
phase
unless
he
puts
them
at
issue.
so
i
submit
that
the
difference
is
that
when
he
makes
the
selection,
he
is
considering
its
point.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir.
not
under
the
present
procedures
of
which
i’m
aware.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
agree.
and
there’s
that
possibility
but
it
has
when
you
consider
that
that
evidence
cannot
be
introduced
by
the
state
in
a
single
trial,
unless
the
defendant
puts
it
into
issue
himself
then
the
defendant’s
choice
in
avoiding
the
testimony
and
avoiding
getting
under
the
stand
gives
him
the
--
deprives
him
of
the
opportunity
to
discuss
this
matter
of
punishment
with
the
people
who
actually
are
going
to
decide
whether
he
lives
or
dies.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
there
was
no
request
made
in
this
case,
your
honor.
subsequent
to
this
case
there
have
been
requests
for
bifurcated
trials
made
by
the
defendants
in
ohio.
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
it
has
been
granted
a
motion
made
prior
to
trial
by
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
objection
was
made
by
the
defendant
on
filing
his
application.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
first
instance
that
i
know
of
in
my
study
of
this
case,
your
honor
is
the
case
of
maxwell
versus
bishop
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
1968
term,
i
believe.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir
i
did
not.
this
procedure
of
ohio,
it
forces
the
defendant
to
make
his
selection
between
these
two
rights
is
we
claim
similar
to
the
procedure
that
was
condemned
by
this
court
in
the
simmons
case
that
in
a
constitutional
right
should
not
have
to
be
surrendered
in
order
to
assert
another
constitutional
right.
we
submit
that
the
ohio
single
verdict
procedure
compels
this
type
of
a
surrender.
the
procedure
also
imposes
--
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
am,
sir.
the
right
of
allocution
--
the
right
to
offer
evidence
on
the
question
of
his
punishment
and
the
right
to
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
his
sentencer,
i
submit
is
a
right
guaranteed
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
only
cases
that
we
refer
to
as
supporting
this
contention
your
honor
are
the
cases
of
specht
versus
patterson
and
mempa
versus
rhay.
this
court
has
also
considered
the
burdens
that
are
placed
upon
the
assertion
of
a
constitutional
right
in
united
states
versus
jackson
and
in
crampton
we
contend
that
there
is
a
impermissible
burden
placed
upon
the
defendants
exercise
of
his
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
in
violation
of
this
court’s
holding
in
the
jackson
case.
the
procedure
in
ohio
has
the
quality
of
needlessly
encouraging
a
waiver
of
this
fifth
amendment
right
if
he
wishes
to
talk
to
the
jury
and
it
needlessly
chills
the
right
to
present
evidence
on
the
question
of
punishment
relevant
to
his
rational
sentencing.
the
court
under
the
united
states
constitution
has
held
that
the
defendant
need
not
do
anything
to
defend
himself
against
a
charge
brought
against
him
but
it
has
likewise
observe
that
he
certainly
cannot
be
required
to
help
convict
himself.
we
submit
that
the
ohio
procedure
requires
that
he
help
convict
himself
and
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
for
that
reason.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
is
to
a
certain
extent.
however,
introducing
the
medical
records
to
support
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
the
defendant
had
to
take
another
calculated
risk
as
to
its
trial
tactics
because
in
those
records
was
contained
his
prior
criminal
record
which
he
had
told
the
admissions
officer
and
the
doctors
and
the
psychiatrists
at
the
hospitals
from
which
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
sir
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
the
prejudice
of
incriminating
himself,
the
possibility
of
incriminating
himself
in
this
case
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment,
the
basic
contention
is
that
the
jury
having
at
one
seating
to
consider
guilt
or
innocence,
sanity
or
insanity,
and
punishment
either
death
or
life
is
a
procedure
that
compels
the
defendant
to
make
certain
choices
which
are
needlessly
made
which
he
does
not
have
to
make
if
there
were
a
bifurcated
trial,
if
there
were
judge
sentencing
or
review
of
the
sentence
by
judges
in
ohio
or
if
the
death
penalty
were
abolished.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
he
would
be
subjecting
himself
to
by
the
state’s
questions
to
testimony
about
the
crime
itself,
the
prejudice
is
in
the
--
in
incriminating
himself.
he
would
be
in
effect
helping
the
state
to
convict
himself
--
convict
him
of
his
crime.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
spencer,
against
texas?
mr.
john
j.
callahan
maxwell
versus
bishop,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
maxwell
versus
bishop
which
was
--
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
do
not
believe
it
was
cited.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
it
was
on
the
--
decided
by
this
court
during
the
last
term.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
this
was.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
with
reference
to
spencer
versus
texas,
the
syllabus
report
being
made
available
to
the
jury
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
case
prior
their
consideration
of
the
crime.
the
only
manner
in
which
we
can
distinguish
that
case
your
honor
is
that
the
--
this
was
if
i
recall
not
a
capital
case
and
i
would
feel
that
there
would
be
a
great
deal
more
concerned
about
the
defendant’s
right
to
speak
to
a
jury
or
the
right
of
records
coming
in,
in
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
right
in
a
capital
case.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no,
sir.
i
do
not
raise
that
as
a
constitutional
question.
i’m
merely
contending
that
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
his
guilt
and
an
opportunity
to
address
his
sentencer
on
the
issue
of
his
punishment.
the
trifurcated
trial
with
the
california
problem,
we
are
not
saying
in
our
submission
is
a
constitutional
matter.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
not
repeat
what
has
been
said
generally
with
respects
to
standards
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
ohio
as
it
has
been
suggested
in
a
couple
of
briefs
filed
in
this
case
could
be
considered
to
have
a
standard
cited
on
page
20
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
is
the
case
of
howell
versus
state
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
was
error
--
not
error
to
charge
the
jury
in
the
capital
case
“to
consider
and
determine
whether
or
not
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
and
facts
leading
up
to
and
attending
the
alleged
homicide
as
disclosed
by
the
evidence
you
should
or
should
not
make
such
recommendation
of
mercy.”
i
will
submit
that
that
is
merely
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
they
should
consider
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
it
may
be
a
standard.
but
if
not
an
adequate
standard
and
it
was
not
given
in
the
crampton
case,
the
only
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
that
is
other,
that
is
the
seated
jury,
the
12
people
appears
at
page
5
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
on
the
first
degree
the
punishment
is
death
unless
you
recommend
mercy
in
which
case
it
is
life.
but
the
instruction
goes
on
and
is
diametrically
opposed
to
the
instruction
which
follow
the
penalty
trial
in
california
and
the
instruction
which
appears
at
page
6
of
the
brief
says
you
must
not
be
influenced
by
any
considerations
of
sympathy
or
prejudice.
i
submit
that
when
you
tell
the
jury
that
one
of
the
things
that
must
not
consider
is
sympathy,
you
have
effectively
stopped
any
argument
by
the
defendant
for
mercy
in
the
case.
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
the
single
verdict
trial,
the
bifurcated
trial
would
be
available
also
to
a
defendant.
in
cases
of
self-defense
defenses
or
in
case
of
alibi
defenses,
the
distinction
that
i
would
point
out
with
reference
to
those
two
observations
is
that
both
of
this
matters
self-defense
and
alibi
relate
to
the
question
of
the
defendants
guilt.
they
do
not
go
to
the
question
of
his
punishment.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
submit
that
it
could
be
argued
that
way,
your
honor
but
it
is
not
part
of
the
submission
in
this
case
that
we
require
a
--
that
they
require
a
bifurcated
trial
under
self-
defense
and
alibi.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
don’t
think
that
they
could
be
just
as
valid
as
the
insanity
argument.
the
insanity
plea
has
been
--
is
a
different
type
of
plea
involving
a
certain
admission
by
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
that
is
correct
but
to
say
that
--
they
do
not
however,
self-defense
or
insanity
or
alibi
relate
directly
to
the
question
of
punishment
and
what
we
are
contending
in
this
case
is
that
the
bifurcated
trial
should
permit
the
defendant
after
he
has
been
found
guilty
and
responsible
to
address
the
sentencer
on
the
question
of
his
punishment.
the
trilogy
of
guilty
plea
decisions
made
by
this
court
last
term,
i
believe
can
be
effectively
distinguished
from
the
crampton
case
as
the
crampton
case
--
in
crampton,
he
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
stood
on
that
plea
throughout.
whereas
the
cases
decided
by
the
court
in
the
last
term
the
brady,
mcmann
and
parker
cases
involved
originally
a
guilty
plea.
a
concession
by
the
defendant
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
crime.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
argued,
the
decision
of
the
ohio
courts
should
be
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
for
determination
with
respect
to
punishment.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
yes,
i
don’t
do
see
no
constitutional
barrier
for
prohibiting
the
legislature
from
fixing
standards
for
the
judge.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
oh!
i
would
have
to
let
go
somewhat
of
mr.
selvin
said
in
his
case.
the
judge
is
in
effect
a
professional
sentencer
by
his
training,
by
his
expertise
that
he
and
his
background
he
brings
a
certain
criteria
to
a
case.
and
i
think,
it’s
the
essence
of
the
judgeship
that
he
should
not
have
to
have
standards
imposed
by
the
legislature.
it
is
only
for
the
layman
who
sees
--
who
seats
at
one
time
and
is
in
effect
an
ad
hoc
legislature
on
the
question
of
the
punishment
in
the
case
that
we
need
standards
to
guide
them.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
i
recall
it
conclusion
on
the
calvin
reports.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
no
sir
not
that
conclusion.
they
--
with
reference
to
the
problem
of
standards,
there
appears
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
at
page
21
probably
the
best
evidence
with
respect
to
the
necessity
for
standards
where
a
foreman
of
a
jury
comes
before
the
court
and
asks
the
court
what
criteria?
what
are
the
grounds
for
granting
mercy
in
the
case
and
there
is
a
colloquy
there
between
the
judge
and
the
foreman
of
the
jury
that
betrays
the
jury’s
curiosity
as
to
the
standards
necessary
for
the
granting
of
mercy.
even
to
the
point
where
they
want
to
consider
the
sociological
and
environmental
factors
in
it
and
it’s
possible
that
these
standards
should
not
be
as
detailed
as
the
standards
in
the
model
penal
code
but
there
should
be
some
guidelines
given
to
the
jury
so
that
they
could
move
ahead
on
this
question
of
standards
with
guidelines
rather
than
operate
in
the
vacuum
as
they
appear
to
be
doing
in
caldwell
case
which
we
have
cited.
accordingly,
i
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
john
j.
callahan
thank
you,
your
honor.
