mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner’s
basic
decision
in
regard
to
the
question
of
bifurcation
of
trials
and
capital
cases
consist
of
three
matters.
his
first
position
is
that
there
is
a
collision
of
constitutional
rights.
in
this
particular
case,
he
claims
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
his
alleged
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
allocution
are
colliding,
and
that
one
impermissibly
burdens
the
exercise
of
his
privilege
not
to
testify.
his
reliance
in
that
regard
on
the
cases
of
u.s.
versus
jackson,
simmons
and
cases
were
two
specific
constitutional
rights
were
involved.
it
is
further
the
amici
claim
that
we
have
a
question
of
fundamental
fairness
under
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
there
is
no
collision
of
constitutional
right
in
that
number
one,
allocution
has
never
risen
to
a
constitutional
right.
secondly,
that
there
is
no
burden
or
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
his
right
against
self-incrimination
because
allocution
evidence
can
be
admitted
by
other
witnesses.
secondly,
the
petitioner
had
a
choice
to
do
what
he
considered
would
benefit
him
the
most
when
he
made
his
decision
not
to
take
the
stand.
there
was
no
compulsion,
there
was
no
extra
burden
it
was
a
pure
voluntary
choice.
it
is
also
our
position
that
the
unitary
trial
is
fundamentally
fair.
and
indeed,
better
on
the
facts
than
in
the
case
of
spencer
versus
texas
which
justice
blackmun
referred
to.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
in
this
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
in
this
specific
case
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
mother
of
the
defendant
who
knew
nothing
of
the
facts
of
the
actual
crime
testified
as
to
the
petitioner’s
entire
life
background,
his
trouble
with
the
law,
his
marriages,
whatever.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
pardon,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
the
ohio
statute
provides
for
character
witnesses
as
to
reputation
and
background
and
character.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
the
defendant
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
i’m
talking
about
the
defendant’s
case
your
honor.
in
his
case
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
the
defendant
may
put
in
his
character
in
issue
other
that
through
himself.
yes,
under
ohio
law.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
well,
the
difference
in
ohio
court
place
is
that
the
defendant
himself
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
petitioner
is
getting
to
--
the
counsel
for
petitioner
is
getting
to.
he
cannot
personally
appeal
to
the
jurors
in
the
case
that
is
his
main
contention.
he
is
not
contending
that
other
witnesses
may
not
testify
as
to
his
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
that
is
correct.
we
have
no
argument
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
that
much
we
would
go
on
with.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
we
submit
to
this
court
that
as
argued
by
counsel,
the
allocation
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
as
in
most
other
states
is
really
only
a
legal
objection
and
it
is
so
historically,
and
this
court
has
noted
that
distinction
in
the
case
of
schwab
versus
berggren
decided
in
1892.
as
stated
in
me
government’s
brief,
it
is
usually
something
like
be
pleading
of
a
pardon
or
any
other
type
of
legal
objection.
it
actually
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sentencing
discretion
regarding
the
defendant’s
opportunity
to
give
mitigating
evidence.
the
only
place
where
i
could
imagine
that
this
plea
of
allocution
under
the
ohio
statute
reply
would
be
where
the
defendant
could
claim
that
there
is
an
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
upon
which
the
verdict
was
based.
these
are
the
normal
things
that
will
be
brought
up
on
a
motion
for
new
trial.
in
regard
further
to
allocution,
the
court
in
williams
versus
new
york,
williams
versus
oklahoma
held
that
the
due
process
clause
did
not
require
a
hearing
and
to
give
a
convicted
person
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
a
sentencing
procedure.
the
hill
case
in
1962,
although
not
a
capital
case,
specifically
stated
that
allocution
was
not
a
constitutional
right.
petitioner
claims
his
only
claim
as
to
elevating
allocution
to
a
constitutional
right
is
base
on
the
decision
of
the
court
in
specht.
but
that
case
is
easily
distinguishable,
that
case
had
its
defendants
upon
another
fact-finding
determination
which
had
to
be
made.
from
these
cases,
we
submit
that
the
petitioner’s
reliance
on
cases
such
as
simmons,
jackson-denno
is
misplaced.
we
are
not
dealing
with
two
specific
constitutional
rights
and
we
submit
that
the
issue
is
very
similar
indeed
to
the
case
of
spencer
versus
texas
is
a
two-part
trial
necessary
purely
because
the
jury
must
decide
two
issues.
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
as
noted
in
the
discussion
with
justice
marshall.
in
this
case,
the
defendant’s
mother
did
testify,
there
was
testimony
of
two
psychiatrists,
there
was
testimony
of
a
physician
and
there
was
introduced
them
to
the
record
three
different
hospital
records.
all
of
these
we
submit
can
only
serve
one
purpose
and
that
was
to
mitigate
the
penalty
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand
and
he
then
claim
that
the
procedures
of
the
unitary
trial
necessarily
chilled
the
assertion
of
his
privilege.
his
decision
to
take
the
stand
or
not
is
a
decision
similar
i
submit
to
the
guilty
plea
cases
decided
by
this
court
last
term.
the
question
is,
was
it
compelled?
was
it
a
voluntary
decision?
we
state
that
the
case
of
williams
versus
florida,
the
alibi
--
notice
of
alibi
case,
this
court
stated
that
the
defendant
faces
such
a
dilemma
demanding
a
choice
between
complete
silence
in
presenting
a
defense
has
never
been
thought
to
be
an
invasion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
in
the
instant
case,
either
impeachment
evidence
or
similar
acts
of
evidence
was
introduced
into
the
record.
if
it
had
been,
the
court
under
ohio
law
would
have
had
to
give
limiting
instructions
to
the
jury
as
to
the
nature
of
that
evidence
and
how
they
could
consider
it.
this
court
has
held
that
under
the
doctrine
of
spencer
versus
texas,
those
types
of
leavening
instructions
are
perfectly
proper.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
introduced
practically
everything
he
could
introduce.
if
the
procedure
in
spencer
versus
texas
was
fundamentally
fair,
were
prior
crime
evidence
was
introduce
without
any
question
now
i
submit
in
a
unitary
capital
case
where
impeachment
is
only
possible
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
that
we
have
a
trial
more
eminently
fair
than
in
spencer.
we
submit
further
that
the
sentencing
in
a
unitary
trial
is
rational
when
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
case.
all
of
the
facts
in
this
case
came
out
in
that
trial.
all
of
the
facts
of
the
defendant’s
background,
the
jury
saw
this
defendant
sitting
there
for
the
week
that
the
case
tried.
they
saw
the
witnesses.
they
heard
his
psychiatrist.
we
would
also
submit,
pardon
me.
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
one
other
thing
the
question
of
the
jury
instruction
in
this
particular
case.
the
court
will
find
in
volume
1
of
the
record
in
this
case
that
on
the
--
before
their
examination
of
the
entire
veneer
of
the
juries,
the
court
did
a
little
more
than
what
was
found
in
a
final
charge
on
it
described
the
duties
of
juries
functions
when
it
came
to
the
recommendation
of
mercy.
the
court
there
stated
that,
that
decision
must
be
based
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
evidence.
we
also
submit
to
the
court
that
the
alternative
of
the
bifurcated
trial
is
--
the
alternative
of
a
bifurcated
trial
is
not
free
of
potential
harm.
just
again
as
in
the
guilty
plea
cases
where
this
court
stated
that
it
would
not
be
fair
or
that
would
be
cruel
to
make
all
defendants
submit
to
a
jury
trial
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
also
be
cruel
to
make
all
defendants
submit
to
a
penalty
trial.
the
use
of
the
unitary
trial
has
a
very
long
history
in
this
country.
only
six
states
as
the
court
has
noted
have
the
split
verdict
procedure.
the
states
have
a
very
valid
interest
and
purpose
in
maintaining
that
unitary
trial.
the
alternative
of
bifurcation
and
i
submit
possibly
trifurcation
and
quadfurcation,
if
a
constitutional
principle
is
to
be
announced
could
only
add
to
the
time,
cost
and
complexity
of
criminal
trials
and
appeals.
that
burden
became
very
evident
this
very
morning
when
it
was
stated
that
69%
of
the
penalty
trials
in
california
had
been
reversed
requiring
new
juries,
more
court
time.
the
extra
burden
would
be
disproportionate
we
submit
to
the
alleged
possible
benefits
and
in
some
instances
actually
detrimental
to
the
defendants.
there
have
been
cases
where
defendants
have
complained
that
they
had
to
stand
a
penalty
trial.
we
submit
that
the
convenience
of
a
single
proceeding
weighs
heavily
against
an
added
procedure
which
this
court
has
stated
is
not
constitutionally
required.
in
regard
to
the
standards
issue,
as
i
have
stated
in
the
bifurcated
trial
argument,
the
decision
is
based
upon
the
evidence
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
ohio
supreme
court
cases
have
so
held
the
howell
case,
the
caldwell,
the
shelton
case.
the
ashbrook
case
which
has
been
cited
by
the
petitioner
here
that
there
can
be
no
evidence
introduced
pointing
towards
mercy
was
a
court
of
appeals
case.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
in
this
very
case
indirectly
overruled
the
court
of
appeals
holding.
i
think
that
the
question
is
ultimately,
have
any
type
of
standards
ever
be
attainable?
we
submit
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
articulate
any
type
of
list
of
factors
in
advance
for
every
conceivable
situation
that
might
arise
in
the
future.
to
say
that
on
one
hand
there
are
required
findings
a
jury
must
make
or
to
say
no
on
the
other
hand
that
it
is
just
a
matter
of
reference
to
the
jury
so
it
can
guide
them.
we
think
is
an
inconsistency.
constitutionally,
if
it
is
required
it
would
have
to
be
findings.
this
court
in
the
past
in
the
winston
case
and
in
the
enbridge
case
approved
full
jury
discretion.
we
don’t
believe
and
we
submit
earnestly
that
regardless
of
any
standards
that
the
decisions
of
the
juries
would
not
be
any
different
in
what
they
are
today
and
the
two
cases
the
court
is
now
hearing.
the
jury
discretion
expresses
the
conscience
of
the
community
as
this
court
has
held
in
witherspoon
and
it
is
in
the
end
a
value
judgment
as
to
the
sentence
and
not
to
guilt
and
it
should
not
be
subject
to
the
same
formalities
of
the
guilt
determination
process.
the
long
standing
and
widespread
use
of
absolute
discretion
which
this
court
noted
plus
the
fact
that
no
court
has
ever
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendant
on
this
particular
issue
and
there
had
been
many,
many
cases
as
cited
in
the
briefs,
we
believe
reflects
that
the
principle
of
the
unitary
trial
was
standardless
discretion
to
the
jury
is
not
only
constitutionally
sound
but
one
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
now
required.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner’s
basic
decision
in
regard
to
the
question
of
bifurcation
of
trials
and
capital
cases
consist
of
three
matters.
his
first
position
is
that
there
is
a
collision
of
constitutional
rights.
in
this
particular
case,
he
claims
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
his
alleged
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
allocution
are
colliding,
and
that
one
impermissibly
burdens
the
exercise
of
his
privilege
not
to
testify.
his
reliance
in
that
regard
on
the
cases
of
u.s.
versus
jackson,
simmons
and
cases
were
two
specific
constitutional
rights
were
involved.
it
is
further
the
amici
claim
that
we
have
a
question
of
fundamental
fairness
under
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
there
is
no
collision
of
constitutional
right
in
that
number
one,
allocution
has
never
risen
to
a
constitutional
right.
secondly,
that
there
is
no
burden
or
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
his
right
against
self-incrimination
because
allocution
evidence
can
be
admitted
by
other
witnesses.
secondly,
the
petitioner
had
a
choice
to
do
what
he
considered
would
benefit
him
the
most
when
he
made
his
decision
not
to
take
the
stand.
there
was
no
compulsion,
there
was
no
extra
burden
it
was
a
pure
voluntary
choice.
it
is
also
our
position
that
the
unitary
trial
is
fundamentally
fair.
and
indeed,
better
on
the
facts
than
in
the
case
of
spencer
versus
texas
which
justice
blackmun
referred
to.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
in
this
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
in
this
specific
case
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
mother
of
the
defendant
who
knew
nothing
of
the
facts
of
the
actual
crime
testified
as
to
the
petitioner’s
entire
life
background,
his
trouble
with
the
law,
his
marriages,
whatever.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
pardon,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
the
ohio
statute
provides
for
character
witnesses
as
to
reputation
and
background
and
character.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
the
defendant
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
i’m
talking
about
the
defendant’s
case
your
honor.
in
his
case
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
the
defendant
may
put
in
his
character
in
issue
other
that
through
himself.
yes,
under
ohio
law.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
well,
the
difference
in
ohio
court
place
is
that
the
defendant
himself
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
petitioner
is
getting
to
--
the
counsel
for
petitioner
is
getting
to.
he
cannot
personally
appeal
to
the
jurors
in
the
case
that
is
his
main
contention.
he
is
not
contending
that
other
witnesses
may
not
testify
as
to
his
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
that
is
correct.
we
have
no
argument
--
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
that
much
we
would
go
on
with.
mr.
melvin
l.
resnick
we
submit
to
this
court
that
as
argued
by
counsel,
the
allocation
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
as
in
most
other
states
is
really
only
a

in

further
to
allocution,

the

specifically

is
very
similar
indeed
to
the
case
of
spencer
versus
texas
is
a
two-part
trial
necessary
purely
because
the
jury
must
decide
two
issues.
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
as
noted
in
the
discussion
with
justice
marshall.
in
this
case,
the
defendant’s
mother
did
testify,
there
was
testimony
of
two
psychiatrists,
there
was
testimony
of
a
physician
and
there
was
introduced
them
to
the
record
three
different
hospital
records.
all
of
these
we
submit
can
only
serve
one
purpose
and
that
was
to
mitigate
the
penalty
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
did
not
take
the
stand
and
he
then
claim
that
the
procedures
of
the
unitary
trial
necessarily
chilled
the
assertion
of
his
privilege.
his
decision
to
take
the
stand
or
not
is
a
decision
similar
i
submit
to
the
guilty
plea
cases
decided
by
this
court
last
term.
the
question
is,
was
it
compelled?
was
it
a
voluntary
decision?
we
state
that
the
case
of
williams
versus
florida,
the
alibi
--
notice
of
alibi
case,
this
court
stated
that
the
defendant
faces
such
a
dilemma
demanding
a
choice
between
complete
silence
in
presenting
a
defense
has
never
been
thought
to
be
an
invasion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
in
the
instant
case,
either
impeachment
evidence
or
similar
acts
of
evidence
was
introduced
into
the
record.
if
it
had
been,
the
court
under
ohio
law
would
have
had
to
give
limiting
instructions
to
the
jury
as
to
the
nature
of
that
evidence
and
how
they
could
consider
it.
this
court
has
held
that
under
the
doctrine
of
spencer
versus
texas,
those
types
of
leavening
instructions
are
perfectly
proper.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
introduced
practically
everything
he
could
introduce.
if
the
procedure
in
spencer
versus
texas
was
fundamentally
fair,
were
prior
crime
evidence
was
introduce
without
any
question
now
i
submit
in
a
unitary
capital
case
where
impeachment
is
only
possible
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
that
we
have
a
trial
more
eminently
fair
than
in
spencer.
we
submit
further
that
the
sentencing
in
a
unitary
trial
is
rational
when
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
case.
all
of
the
facts
in
this
case
came
out
in
that
trial.
all
of
the
facts
of
the
defendant’s
background,
the
jury
saw
this
defendant
sitting
there
for
the
week
that
the
case
tried.
they
saw
the
witnesses.
they
heard
his
psychiatrist.
we
would
also
submit,
pardon
me.
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
one
other
thing
the
question
of
the
jury
instruction
in
this
particular
case.
the
court
will
find
in
volume
1
of
the
record
in
this
case
that
on
the
--
before
their
examination
of
the
entire
veneer
of
the
juries,
the
court
did
a
little
more
than
what
was
found
in
a
final
charge
on
it
described
the
duties
of
juries
functions
when
it
came
to
the
recommendation
of
mercy.
the
court
there
stated
that,
that
decision
must
be
based
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
evidence.
we
also
submit
to
the
court
that
the
alternative
of
the
bifurcated
trial
is
--
the
alternative
of
a
bifurcated
trial
is
not
free
of
potential
harm.
just
again
as
in
the
guilty
plea
cases
where
this
court
stated
that
it
would
not
be
fair
or
that
would
be
cruel
to
make
all
defendants
submit
to
a
jury
trial
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
also
be
cruel
to
make
all
defendants
submit
to
a
penalty
trial.
the
use
of
the
unitary
trial
has
a
very
long
history
in
this
country.
only
six
states
as
the
court
has
noted
have
the
split
verdict
procedure.
the
states
have
a
very
valid
interest
and
purpose
in
maintaining
that
unitary
trial.
the
alternative
of
bifurcation
and
i
submit
possibly
trifurcation
and
quadfurcation,
if
a
constitutional
principle
is
to
be
announced
could
only
add
to
the
time,
cost
and
complexity
of
criminal
trials
and
appeals.
that
burden
became
very
evident
this
very
morning
when
it
was
stated
that
69%
of
the
penalty
trials
in
california
had
been
reversed
requiring
new
juries,
more
court
time.
the
extra
burden
would
be
disproportionate
we
submit
to
the
alleged
possible
benefits
and
in
some
instances
actually
detrimental
to
the
defendants.
there
have
been
cases
where
defendants
have
complained
that
they
had
to
stand
a
penalty
trial.
we
submit
that
the
convenience
of
a
single
proceeding
weighs
heavily
against
an
added
procedure
which
this
court
has
stated
is
not
constitutionally
required.
in
regard
to
the
standards
issue,
as
i
have
stated
in
the
bifurcated
trial
argument,
the
decision
is
based
upon
the
evidence
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
ohio
supreme
court
cases
have
so
held
the
howell
case,
the
caldwell,
the
shelton
case.
the
ashbrook
case
which
has
been
cited
by
the
petitioner
here
that
there
can
be
no
evidence
introduced
pointing
towards
mercy
was
a
court
of
appeals
case.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
in
this
very
case
indirectly
overruled
the
court
of
appeals
holding.
i
think
that
the
question
is
ultimately,
have
any
type
of
standards
ever
be
attainable?
we
submit
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
articulate
any
type
of
list
of
factors
in
advance
for
every
conceivable
situation
that
might
arise
in
the
future.
to
say
that
on
one
hand
there
are
required
findings
a
jury
must
make
or
to
say
no
on
the
other
hand
that
it
is
just
a
matter
of
reference
to
the
jury
so
it
can
guide
them.
we
think
is
an
inconsistency.
constitutionally,
if
it
is
required
it
would
have
to
be
findings.
this
court
in
the
past
in
the
winston
case
and
in
the
enbridge
case
approved
full
jury
discretion.
we
don’t
believe
and
we
submit
earnestly
that
regardless
of
any
standards
that
the
decisions
of
the
juries
would
not
be
any
different
in
what
they
are
today
and
the
two
cases
the
court
is
now
hearing.
the
jury
discretion
expresses
the
conscience
of
the
community
as
this
court
has
held
in
witherspoon
and
it
is
in
the
end
a
value
judgment
as
to
the
sentence
and
not
to
guilt
and
it
should
not
be
subject
to
the
same
formalities
of
the
guilt
determination
process.
the
long
standing
and
widespread
use
of
absolute
discretion
which
this
court
noted
plus
the
fact
that
no
court
has
ever
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendant
on
this
particular
issue
and
there
had
been
many,
many
cases
as
cited
in
the
briefs,
we
believe
reflects
that
the
principle
of
the
unitary
trial
was
standardless
discretion
to
the
jury
is
not
only
constitutionally
sound
but
one
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
now
required.
thank
you.
