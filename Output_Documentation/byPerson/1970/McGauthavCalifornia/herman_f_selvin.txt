mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
to
review
a
judgment
of
death
imposed
by
a
jury
upon
the
petitioner
after
his
conviction
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
the
question
that
is
raised
and
to
which
the
granting
of
certiorari
was
limited,
is
whether
california’s
procedure
of
imposing
the
death
penalty
by
leaving
the
choice
of
penalty
to
the
jury
in
its
absolute
discretion,
unguided
and
uncontrolled
by
any
standards
fixed
by
law
is
a
denial
of
due
process
that
there
are
no
standards
governing
the
process
on
this
law
of
california.
as
a
fact,
it
has
been
noted
of
many
times
by
the
highest
court
of
that
state
and
the
jury
in
this
case
was
told
that
in
so
many
words.
but
to
them
and
in
their
absolute
discretion
was
confided
the
choice
of
penalty
for
which
choice
the
law
fix
no
standards.
it
is
by
plan
to
discus
that
question
for
what
it
is,
a
question
of
law,
not
one
of
penology,
not
one
of
policy.
the
question
of
does
not
necessarily
implicate
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
per
se.
it
is
aimed
primarily
so
far
as
our
presentation
is
concerned
at
the
procedure.
the
standardless
procedure
by
which
california
imposes
the
penalty,
that
being
so,
i
suggest
that
we
are
brought
to
grips
with
first
principles
arising
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
main
purpose,
the
basic
purpose
of
that
clause
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
is
to
prevent
government
from
imposing
burdens
upon
a
person
from
depriving
a
person
of
his
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
save
as
this
court
set
expressed
at
one
case,
save
by
the
valid
laws
of
the
land.
now,
that
does
not
mean
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
first
cases
of
the
rules
after
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
been
adopted.
that
does
not
mean
any
law
that
a
legislature
may
enact.
it
means
only
those
laws
that
are
consistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
amendment,
that
purpose
being
in
a
few
words
to
impose
upon
the
judicial
process
and
the
legislative
process
too
for
that
matter,
the
rule
of
law.
it
is
a
requirement
because
it
is
inherent
in
that
purpose
that
law
shall
mean
not
something
for
the
occasion
or
for
the
moment
but
some
fixed
and
ascertainable
standards
by
which
a
rule
is
established.
not
merely
so
that
individuals
may
be
able
to
conduct
themselves
in
conformity
to
the
law,
but
as
well
so
that
the
courts
may
determine
whether
in
fact
they
have
conducted
themselves
in
conformity
with
the
law.
in
other
words,
the
rule
of
law
established
by
the
due
process
clause,
i
submit,
imposes
a
rule
of
decision
or
standards
for
a
rule
of
decision
as
well
as
standards
for
a
rule
of
conduct.
we’d
have,
i
suggest
no
trouble.
no
trouble
with
that
concept
if
what
were
before
this
court
was
statute
of
a
sort
said
for
instance
that
murder
was
simply
any
killing.
that
in
the
absolute
discretion
of
a
jury
was
determined
to
be
deserving
of
some
kind
of
punishment.
we
would
have
no
trouble
because
the
rule
is
thoroughly
established.
that
a
statute
must
so
define
proscribed
conduct
as
to
enable
not
only
the
person
to
conduct
himself
lawfully
but
enable
to
a
court
to
determine
whether
he
has
conducted
himself
lawfully.
if
that
is
so,
if
that
is
so
in
respect
of
the
determination
of
guilt,
why
should
it
not
be
in
respect
of
the
imposition
of
penalty?
the
process
by
which
a
person
is
deprived
of
his
life
is
not
a
fragmented
process
even
though
the
actual
trial
may
as
it
is
in
california
be
divided
into
two
stages.
it
is
one
process
from
accusation
through
the
final
imposition
of
sentence
and
there
is
nothing,
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
provides
that
it
shall
be
applicable
only
to
a
part
rather
than
the
whole
of
that
process
and
as
this
court
has
said
in
that
connection.
the
sentencing
procedure
is
not
immune
to
scrutiny
under
the
due
process
clause.
well
then
if
in
respect
of
determination
of
guilt,
the
rule
of
law
imports
that
necessity
for
standards
does
it
not
in
respect
of
the
sentence.
the
sentence
after
all
is
the
final
culmination
of
the
process
by
which
the
defendant
is
to
be
deprived
of
its
life
or
liberty
as
the
case
may
be.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
since
1957,
i
believe
your
honor.
it’s
been
quite
a
while.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
since
that
bifurcated
procedure,
yes
your
honor.
and
indeed,
even
before
the
bifurcated
procedure,
the
jury
had
fixed
the
punishment
for
good
many
years.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
not
necessarily.
my
submission
then
would
be
alternatively.
the
first
answer
i
would
make
is
that
if
standards
are
required
of
the
sentencing
power,
they
are
required
of
the
judge
as
well
as
of
the
jury.
but
the
cases
of
the
judges
are
classifiably
different
situation.
and
the
legislature
might
well
distinguish
between
the
two.
there
is
the
matter
of
the
judge’s
special
training
and
experience
and
expertise.
there
is
his
greater
knowledge
of
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
criminal
law,
a
knowledge
that
goes
beyond
that
which
an
ordinary
person
could
be
supposed
or
deemed
to
have.
and
there
is
the
coordination
of
his
own
action,
his
own
exercise
of
discretion
to
what
he
determines
from
his
experience
and
from
his
knowledge
of
the
law
are
the
objectives
and
the
aims
of
punishment.
that
being
so,
the
likelihood
that
he
would
arrive
about
a
result
intended
or
dictated
by
the
law
as
distinguished
from
personal
preference
or
personal
reaction
in
this
situation
is
so
much
greater
that
a
legislature
could
very
well
classify
between
the
two
and
insulate
that
classification
in
submission
for
many
contention
on
writable
protection
of
due
process.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well
it
is
less
indicative,
it
is
not
necessarily.
so
of
course,
i
recognize
as
california
argues
that
there
were
factors
in
the
evidence
upon
which
a
jury
might
rationally
have
made
a
difference
between
the
two
men.
the
vice
is
we
don’t
know
that
that’s
what
they
did.
the
particular
vices
they
weren’t
told
that
the
law
makes
whatever
it
is
they
may
have
decided
in
that
connection,
a
distinguishable
or
not
a
distinguishable
but
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
men.
we,
--
the
california
has
said
that
the
jury
undoubtedly
determined
that
mcgautha
was
the
triggerman.
well,
i
would
say
that’s
a
pretty
good
guess
but
it
is
by
no
means
an
unelectable
inference
or
even
an
inference
that
probably
should
be
drawn.
the
evidence
on
that
score
was
in
sharp
conflict
and
under
a
statute
imposing
standards
of
a
sort
for
instance
that
we
find
in
the
model
penal
code.
notwithstanding
that
the
jury
ex
hypothesi
was
satisfied
that
mcgautha
pulled
the
trigger.
there
might
have
been
because
of
the
sharp
conflict,
enough
doubt
in
their
mind
so
that
under
an
appropriate
instruction,
they
could
have
treated
that
doubt
as
mitigating
circumstance.
now
i
am
not
saying
the
constitution
requires
that
that
be
treated
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
that’s
an
indication
of
the
kind
of
standards
that
could
be
framed,
that
could
be
imposed
and
that
might
lead
to
the
very
result
understandably
and
inferably
at
which
here
california
only
guesses.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
there
is
testimony.
mr.
wilkinson
testified
in
the
fact
that
it
was
mcgautha.
mcgautha
testified
in
the
fact
that
it
was
wilkinson.
there
are
some
evidence
from
the
proprietor
of
the
store,
the
lady
involved
describing
the
activities
of
the
two
men.
describing
the
activity
of
one
of
the
man
who
from
her
description
of
the
size
and
coloration
and
the
rest
must
have
been
mcgautha,
which
was
inconsistent
with
mcgautha
having
been
being
able
to
fire
the
shot.
as
i
say,
the
evidence
on
that
score
was
in
sharp
conflict.
and
the
part
then
--
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
in
conflict
within
the
prosecutions
own
case,
the
jury
didn’t
have
to
wait
till
the
penalty
faces
a
trial
for
that
conflict
to
develop
cause
neither
of
the
defendants
took
the
stand
in
the
guilt
phase.
but
from
the
ballistic
testimony
on
the
one
hand,
the
testimony
of
the
proprietor
distort
on
the
other.
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
prosecution’s
case
about
which
one
of
the
two
fired
the
shot.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
that
the
legislature
--
yes,
could
classify
the
judge
differently
and
treat
the
judge
situation
as
different
from
that
of
the
jury
because
of
the
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i’d
say,
i
distinguish
between
the
judge
and
the
jury
in
respect
of
their
expertise
in
the
law.
so
far
as
the
conscience
of
the
community
is
concerned
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that
when
he
considers
the
aims
and
objects
of
punishment,
when
he
considers
the
material,
the
information
that
the
normal
practice
every
judge
gets
by
way
of
pre-sentence
reports,
probation
reports
and
the
like.
i
think
that
there
is
a
considered
and
designed
effort
to
impose
the
particular
penalty
into
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
in
judge’s
opinion
as
an
expert
of
the
law,
is
what
the
law
had
in
mind
as
a
general
policy.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
simply
as
a
question
of
law
simply
because
the
statute
did
nothing
that
necessarily
imposes
upon
on
a
state,
a
sharply
defined
division
between
the
functions
of
judge
and
jury
in
the
case.
the
common
law
for
many
years
and
it
wasn’t
it
until
facts’
act
and
others,
the
jury
decided
the
law
in
libel
cases
among
other
things.
that
was
submitted
to
them.
it
is
not
unknown
to
the
law
that
questions
of
law
may
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
but
when
they
are,
i
suggest
they
generally
admitted
under
recharge
that
attempts
at
least
to
put
before
the
jury,
the
considerations
of
the
law
considers
to
be
determinants
of
decision
and
that
is
what
the
california
procedure
does
not
do.
now,
if
i
may
say
just
a
word,
if
your
honor
please,
about
the
conscience
of
the
community.
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
jury
does
reflect
the
conscience
of
the
community.
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
a
link
between
the
community
and
the
jury
is
an
important
part
of
our
judicial
system,
but
that
link
must
be
maintained
and
that
conscience
must
be
exercised
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
and
the
jury
must
have
those
limits,
explained
to
it
and
those
limits
must
be
fixed
to
the
extent
that
they
need
to
be
made
specific
by
the
law.
i
need
only
cite
by
way
of
example
to
comparatively
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
reitman
against
mulkey
at
initiative
measure
expressing
the
conscience
of
the
california
community
overwhelmingly
and
directly
in
adopting
a
certain
constitutional
amendment,
and
california
was
held
on
unconstitutional
by
this
court
notwithstanding
that
it
was
the
direct
expression
of
the
conscience
of
community.
in
lucas,
an
initiative
reapportioning
the
colorado
legislature
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
notwithstanding
that
it
represented
the
voice
of
the
community.
what
i
am
saying
is
and
what
those
cases
illustrate
is
that
conscience
is
in
itself
not
an
unbridle
things
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
it
is
confined
by
the
constitution
just
as
much
as
the
legislature,
the
judiciary
or
the
executive
is
confined.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
think
of
in
california.
california
has
the
indeterminate
sentence
law.
there
is
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases
in
other
jurisdictions,
i
understand.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
suppose
that’s
a
purely
logical
or
abstract
question,
the
answer
is
yes,
that
it
should
be.
but
there
again,
do
we
not
have
a
classifiably
different
situation.
in
the
first
place,
the
range
is
a
difference
in
degree,
not
in
kind
as
it
is
in
the
capital
sentencing
case.
the
sentence
is
a
much
more
irrevocable
fact
once
it
is
established.
the
jury
deals
them
with
the
type
of
situation
and
the
pressures
and
the
tensions
and
the
simple
means
that
lead
to
them
with
which
they
are
much
more
likely
to
be
familiar
in
the
ordinary
run
of
life
than
they
are
to
be
familiar
with
what
it
is
that
motivates
someone
who
has
killed
another
human
being.
well,
that’s
a
very
rough
idea
if
you
are
to
please
of
factors
again
that
make
non-capital
jury
sentencing
a
classifiably
different
situation.
i
take
it
that
the
constitution
certainly
doesn’t
require
complete
conformity
or
uniformity.
it
certainly
does
not
require
logical
perfection.
there
must
be
some
room
in
the
joints
to
work.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
holmes’
famous
phrase.
and
some
latitude
must
be
found
in
these
things.
let
me
say
just
a
word
if
i
may
before
i
reserve
what’s
left
of
my
time
to
reply.
i
mentioned
briefly
what
seems
to
be
the
argument
in
opposition
to
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
this
case.
so
far
as
california
is
concerned,
about
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
the
penalty
phase
of
a
murder
trial
in
california
is
a
pretty
fair
(inaudible)
and
all
relevant
evidence
is
submitted,
procedural
niceties
are
observed,
and
review
of
errors
of
law
is
provided
for.
well,
that
begs
the
question.
the
question
is,
our
standards
are
necessary
and
if
they
are,
are
they
given
to
the
jury
as
the
rule
of
law
imposed
in
that
phase
of
the
case
or
isn’t
it?
it
isn’t
enough
to
say
that
the
trial
in
its
non-sentencing
procedural
aspect
is
a
fair
trial.
the
argument
proves
too
much.
you
could
say
exactly
the
same
thing
about
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
and
yet
even
california
would
not
argue
that
the
question
of
guilt
vel
non,
not
guilt
vel
non,
but
definition
of
the
alleged
crime
could
be
left
to
the
jury
without
any
guidelines
or
standards
or
without
any
fixing
by
the
legislature.
the
argument
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
be
that
jury
sentencing
is
an
old
practice.
and
being
an
old
practice,
we
should
retain.
at
least
the
question
that
it
was
--
the
fact
that
it
is
unconstitutional
has
never
been
strongly
enough
urged
apparently
to
have
it
decided
--
to
have
it
decided
that
it
was.
well,
this
court
at
the
close
of
last
turn
seems
to
me
answered
that
kind
of
an
argument.
the
argument
incidentally
also
begs
the
question
because
it
doesn’t
come
to
grips
with
the
proposition
of
whether
due
process
of
law
means
law
in
the
sense
of
standards.
but
the
answer
was
made
by
this
court
in
williams
against
illinois.
neither
the
antiquity
of
the
practice
nor
steadfast
judicial
or
legislative
adherence
to
it
insulates
it
from
attack
under
the
constitution.
and
it
is
that
attack
under
the
constitution
that
we
make
here
primarily
for
the
reason
to
put
it
into
one
short
sentence
that
it
ignores
the
basic
purpose
of
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
to
establish
the
rule
of
law
throughout
the
entire
case,
not
just
a
part
of
it.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
will
say
it
first
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
my
argument
that
it
be
unconstitutional.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
on
balance,
it
would
not
be.
now
the
question
might
arise
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause.
it
might
arise
under
the
due
process
clause.
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
the
argument
that
has
satisfied
my
mind
and
my
own
reflection
on
it
is
that
there
were
a
160
somewhat
crimes
for
which
the
death
penalty
was
a
standard
procedure
to
timely
--
to
time
that
amendment
of
the
constitution
was
adopted.
so
far,
as
due
process
is
concerned,
i
suppose
it
gets
down
ultimately
to
the
question
whether
there
was
such
a
compelling
interest
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
retribution
of
factor
in
the
criminal
law
as
to
justify
taking
ones
life.
because
i
would
submit
that
only
a
compelling
interest
can
justify
the
taking
of
ones
life
even
for
the
commission
of
a
heinous
crime.
but
if
retribution
is
not
such
a
compelling
interest,
then
rehabilitation
and
protection
of
society
at
all
will
rest
of
the
purposes
of
the
punishment
that
can
be
encompassed
and
can
be
furthered
by
a
life
imprisonment,
but
then
will
leave
the
answer
to
the
question
--
let
me
say,
at
least
in
doubt.
but
primarily
from
the
standpoint
of
are
more
or
less
limited
attack
on
the
california
procedure.
there
is
nothing
that
needs
to
be
decided
in
that
connection
that
in
anyway
implicates
the
death
penalty
per
se.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
it
is
capriciously
more
lenient.
it
does
not
--
you
see
california,
california
hasn’t
expressed
any
preference
for
one
penalty
rather
than
the
other.
our
supreme
court
has
said
so
time
and
time
again
and
in
fact
the
juries
told
that
and
just
about
those
words.
the
trouble
with
the
california
situation
is
that
the
penalty
for
murder
has
not
been
fixed
by
the
law.
now
that’s
quite
a
different
thing,
i
submit,
from
saying
the
penalty
is
death
but
someone,
be
at
the
jury,
the
judge
the
governor,
or
some
administrative
commission
has
the
power
do
we
dispense
clemency.
in
that
case,
an
argument
could
be
made.
i
don’t
have
to
make
it
but
an
argument
could
be
made
at
the
requirement
of
standards
does
not
apply
because
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
mercy.
but
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
know
what
it
is
that
you
can
and
can’t
do
and
what
happens
to
you
if
you
do
it.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
so
far
as
the
legislature
is
concerned,
when
it
defines
the
crime
with
constitutional
adequacy
and
says
the
penalty
for
that
crime
is
one
thing
or
the
other,
it
has
by
necessary
--
by
implicitly
set
the
standard
and
it
has
the
legislative
power
within
the
confines
of
the
constitution
to
set
the
standard.
so
far
as
the
judge
is
concerned,
i’ve
answered
that
question
somewhat
ramblingly
before
i
think
it’s
classifiably
different
situation
the
legislature
might
do
it
and
that
justification
for
doing
it
would
be
found
in
the
strong
likelihood
that
the
judges
knowledge
and
sense
of
obligation
and
more
particularly
his
knowledge
of
the
objectives
of
the
criminal
law
would
in
effect
see
to
it
that
the
sentence
is
oppose
in
accordance
with
the
law’s
purposes
and
intentions
in
the
matter.
that
is
in
substance
but
the
california
court
so
set
with
respect
to
it’s
indeterminate
sentence
law
except
that
they
find
from
the
language
of
the
statute
some
rather
more
specific
standards
than
that
but
it
comes
down
at
to
the
same
thing
that
having
set
the
generalized
standards
than
that
but
it
comes
down
at
the
same
thing
at
having
set
the
generalized
standards
the
objective
of
the
statute,
it’s
then
permissible
for
the
legislature
to
imposed
on
one
having
the
necessary
qualifications
of
expertise,
the
job
of
seeing
whether
those
standards
are
met
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
due
to
the
difficulties
of
practicing
laws
on
3000
miles
from
the
seat
of
the
court
and
more
importantly
from
the
location
of
the
brief
printer,
the
reply
brief
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
was
not
available
until
this
morning.
in
fact,
i
only
received
my
copy
this
morning.
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
that
fact
because
some,
not
all,
of
what
i
am
about
to
say
in
reply
is
covered
i
think
more
grammatically
in
any
event
in
that
brief.
it
isn’t
long
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
reply
brief,
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
think
that’s
november
6.
yes,
november
6,
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
i
just
got
my
copy
this
morning.
i
didn’t
--
perhaps,
i
was
confused
by
the
fact
that
the
(inaudible)
of
time
didn’t
permit
the
printer
to
send
proof
to
me.
so,
you
may
find
a
couple
of
typos
and
i’m
sure
you’ll
find
some
awkwardness
of
language
that
might
have
been
ironed
out
that
i
have
approved
it.
in
any
event,
there
are
two
or
three
preliminary
matters
referred
to
by
the
state
of
california
that
i
think
i
should
mention.
whether
this
case
will
affect
the
faith
of
some
550
other
prisoners
is
the
fact
that
none
of
us
i
suppose
can
escape
considering.
in
the
cases
of
those
550
or
very
likely
most
of
them,
whether
this
case
will
affect
them
or
not
will
depend
pretty
largely
on
the
decision
that
is
ultimately
laid
as
to
whether
this
case
assuming
a
result
favorable
to
the
present
petitioner
would
have
retroactive
effect.
i
mentioned
that
for
only
one
reason,
this
is
mcgautha’s
first
time
around.
he
is
still
on
direct
review
of
his
original
sentence.
there
is
no
question
or
element
or
retroactivity
that
needs
to
be
decided
so
far
as
he
is
concerned.
and
i
submit
with
all
the
earnestness
that
i
can,
that
not
withstanding
the
traditional
processes
by
which
a
determination
between
two
individuals
or
between
the
state
and
an
individual
may
have
an
effect
upon
the
law
generally
and
have
an
effect
upon
the
cases
abolished
cannot
implicate
mcgautha’s
constitutional
right
whatever
they
may
be.
it
is
no
approval
necessarily
either
by
counsel
or
by
the
court
of
the
crime
of
which
mcgautha
was
found
guilty
to
determine
that
he
is
entitled
to
be
found
guilty
and
entitled
to
be
sent
to
his
doom
if
it
all,
only
by
the
processes
of
law
required
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
that
is
what
he
sees
here.
now,
reference
has
been
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
california
to
the
number
of
reversals
that
have
emanated
from
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
death
penalty
cases.
it’s
true
there
have
been
a
pretty
large
percentage
of
reversals,
none
of
them
for
reasons
involving
anything
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
have
as
your
honors
are
certainly
aware
from
reading
california’s
brief
and
reading
our
brief
in
this
case.
we
have
in
california
something
called
the
morris
rule
which
prohibits
argument
or
evidence
about
what
the
adult
authority
may
do
in
the
way
of
paroling
a
life
termer.
most,
not
most
of
those
reversals
with
a
very
large
part
of
them
went
off
on
that
particular
local
rule
of
practice.
a
great
many
of
them
went
of
on
witherspoon
grounds
after
this
court
came
down
with
witherspoon
and
may
i
say
they
went
all
upon
witherspoon
grounds
somewhat
grudgingly
so
far
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
concerned
but
nevertheless
they
went
off
from
those.
nothing
in
that
series
of
reversal
has
anything
would
ever
to
do
with
a
proposition
that
the
absence
of
standards
nevertheless
assures
a
defendant
but
the
question
of
his
penalty
will
be
decided
by
the
law
rather
than
by
the
personal
reactions
of
the
jurors
unguided
and
uncontrolled.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
i
have
nothing.
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
that
in
the
way
of
a
suggestion
for
a
minimal
standard
beyond
the
references
to
the
work
of
the
american
law
institute.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
to
a
considerable
extent
perhaps
it
is.
if
not,
well,
he
run
and
know
not
exactly
of
language
except
as
language
channels
thought
and
consideration.
and
confines
thought
and
consideration
to
the
channels
into
which
the
law
wants
it
to
flow.
and
that
i
suggest
that
is
the
important
thing
about
standards
for
a
jury.
instead
of
living
them
completely
at
large,
it
tells
them,
“these
are
the
things
you
want
to
be
thinking
about
and
deciding
whether
to
put
this
man
to
death
or
to
give
him
a
life
term
just
to
say
are
told
in
the
case
of
guilt.
what
do
you
want
to
be
thinking
about?
was
there
premeditation?
was
there
malice
aforethought?
what
there
appropriate
identification
and
so
on
right
down
the
line?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
from
last
part.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
would
suggest
something
that
perhaps
that
needs
an
elaboration
or
a
specification
of
the
general
suggestion
that
i
made
on
the
footnote
on
page
27.
i
myself
so
far
as
my
own
thinking
on
the
subject
concern
have
somewhat
taken
by
the
approach
of
the
american
law
institute
which
is
much
more
specific
and
yet
flexible
enough
than
the
approach
that
i
have
taken.
and
incidentally,
the
commission
to
study
the
revision
of
the
federal
criminal
code
as
taken
substantially
the
same
kind
of
an
approach
although
not
exactly
the
same,
they
differ.
the
fact
that
those
two
commissions,
studying
the
problem
from
conscientious
and
scientific
point
of
view
arrived
at
a
general
propositions
that
was
alike
but
different.
it
shows
that
this
is
not
a
delicate
question
of
federal
state
relationships
since
the
solicitor
has
made
it.
the
states
will
be
left
free
within
a
very
broad
range
to
frame
whatever
standards
they
think
fit
the
conscience
and
standards
of
their
own
particular
community.
all
of
the
constitution
would
require
is
minimal
standard.
now,
it’s
true
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
nothing.
the
fourteenth
says
nothing
about
standards.
may
i
suggest
but
it
says
nothing.
it
says
nothing
about
a
statute
defining
a
crime
being
so
certain
that
a
person
will
know
what
it
is
that
he
can
or
cannot
do.
doesn’t
say
anything
but
there’s
no
question
if
that’s
what
it
means
to
saying
anything
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
the
latter
is
the
american
law
institute
approach
and
the
approach
of
the
commission
studying
the
revision
of
the
federal
criminal
code.
it
is
the
approach
that
i
personally
prefer
because
it
is
specific.
it
gives
the
jury
something
they
can
get
their
teeth
into.
it
gives
them
something
concretely
that
can
be
discuss
in.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
no,
no,
not
that
at
all
without
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
think
as
minimal
standards,
yes.
if
they
can
be
general
standard
i
would,
while
it’s
a
much
less
serious
thing,
i
think
you
would
find
an
analogy
as
to
form
in
the
decisions
relating
the
delegation
of
legislative
power
to
administrative
agencies.
the
standard
that
must
accompany
such
a
delegation
can
be
a
very
general
and
a
very
broad
one.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
specific
and
not
to
indicate
to
the
body
who
its
given
the
power
what
it
is
that
the
delegating
body
thinks
they
ought
to
be
doing
and
how
they
ought
to
go
about
doing
it
now.
i
realized
solicitor
general
propositions,
if
we
want
--
if
a
state
wants
the
specific,
it
finds
a
model
in
the
model
penal
code.
it
can
work
with
that.
if
it
wants
something
that’s
broad
and
general
and
has
much
flexibility,
as
much
room
for
what
has
been
called
the
conscience
of
the
community
as
it
is
possible,
still
keeping
the
operation
of
that
conscience
confined
within
the
broad
boundaries.
it
can
take
the
kind
of
approach
that
i
have
suggested.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
my
opinion
they
would.
i
think
so.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
not
at
all
and
i
am
happy
at
the
opportunity
to
make
that
clear.
we
are
not.
i
am
not
seeking
a
result
that
will
impose
upon
the
50
states
of
this
union,
a
uniform
necessarily
adoptable
procedure
with
respect
to
standard.
they’ve
got
as
much
scope
there.
it
seems
to
me
as
they
have
been
defining
which
constitute
murder
--
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
or
the
murder
at
varying
degrees.
and
while
i’m
in
that,
may
i
interject
that
it
has
nothing
really
to
do
with
what
i
have
just
been
saying
except
with
the
use
of
murder
suggested
to
me.
it’s
true
that
mr.
mcgautha
is
a
four-time
loser
in
the
language
of
mr.
george.
all
of
those
four
convictions
were
in
the
state
of
texas
beginning
i
think
when
he
had
attained
the
ripe
age
of
17.
one
of
those
was
for
the
crime
that
in
texas
it
is
called
murder
without
malice.
now,
murder
without
malice
is
a
somewhat
pejorative
name
for
what
elsewhere
is
called
manslaughter.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
that
makes
a
lighter,
trivial
offense,
of
course
it
doesn’t.
but
it
is
still
not
quite
the
serious
thing
that
is
implied
by
the
word
murder
without
any
explanation
or
qualification.
now,
my
reason
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
at
the
time
of
that?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
don’t
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
this
crime,
i
think
he
was
in
his
early
40’s,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
early
40’s,
41
i
believe,
the
evidence
says
41.
he
had
been
in
california,
i
think
just
a
few
years
before
that
time
having
spent
about
half
of
the
time
from
--
he
became
17
years
of
age
until
he
moved
to
california
having
spent
about
half
of
that
time
in
texas
penitentiary.
he
was
convicted
four
times.
he
did
serve
in
the
armed
forces
in
between
apparently
without
trouble.
now,
having
spent
perhaps
too
much
time
on
what
my
personal
ideas
are
about
what
the
jury
should
be
told
in
respect
to
standards.
i
would
like
to
read
very
briefly
what
mcgautha’s
jury
was
told
and
whatever
california
jury
in
this
kind
of
a
case
is
told
particularly
because
it
disposes
i
submit
of
california’s
argument
that
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial
is
so
fair
and
so
scrupulously
guarded,
that
anything
that
the
defendant
wants
to
put
before
the
jury
can
go
in
and
the
jury
will
know
what
it
is
they
can
do
with
that
evidence.
and
this
is
what
the
jury
has
told.
i
am
not
going
to
read
the
whole
long
instruction
but
the
parts
that
go
really
to
the
question
of
standard.
“it
is
the
law
of
the
state,”
page
222
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
“it
is
the
law
of
the
state
that
every
person
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
shall
suffer
death
or
confinement
in
the
state
imprison
for
life
at
the
discretion
of
the
jury.”
and
then
it
says
a
few
--choose
one
or
the
other
you
may
say
so
and
then
it
goes
on.
notwithstanding
facts
isn’t
proved
in
mitigation
or
aggravation
in
determining
which
punishment
shall
be
inflicted,
you
are
entirely
free
to
act
according
to
your
role
of
judgment,
conscience
and
absolute
discretion.
that
verdict
must
express
the
individual
opinion
of
each
juror.
they
don’t
even
have
to
agree
on
the
reasons
why
they
are
going
to
give
death
or
life
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
but
it’s
an
indication
of
the
extent
to
which
the
procedure
is
completely
uncontrolled
or
unconfined
by
law,
by
standards,
by
criteria
as
to
what
the
law
says
are
the
determinants
that
go
into
making
a
decision,
a
judicial
decision.
no,
i
don’t
say
that
they
have
to
agree
on
all
reasons.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
they
could,
yes,
except
if
they
disagreed
on
whether
there
was
or
was
not
premeditation
for
instance
actually
having
regard
with
the
definition
of
murder
in
california
that
might
not
be
a
valid
verdict.
there,
they
all
have
to
agree
that
there
was
premeditation.
and
they
all
have
to
agree
that
there
was
malice
and
they
all
have
to
agree
that
it
was
the
defendant
who
did
it.
while
that
charge
goes
on
and
this
is
the
important
thing
because
despite
all
of
these
evidence,
despite
everything
that
goes
in,
this
is
what
they
are
told
about
the
extent
to
which
they
can
deal
with
the
situation
on
their
own.
now,
beyond
prescribing
the
two
alternative
penalties,
the
law
itself
provides
no
standard
for
the
guidance
of
the
jury
in
selection
of
a
penalty.
but
rather
commits
the
whole
matter
of
determining
which
of
the
penalties
should
be
fixed
to
the
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion
of
a
jury.
in
the
determination
of
that
matter
if
the
jury
does
agree
it
must
be
unanimous.
and
that’s
what
they’re
told.
despite
everything
that
may
have
been
put
before
them.
it
is
a
matter
entirely
of
their
judgment
conscience
and
absolute
discretion.
now,
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
they
are
told
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
there
are
some.
they
are
not
as
broad
--
i
mean
they
are
not
as
narrow
as
perhaps
might
be
the
case.
i
think
the
general
rule
in
california
is
that
anything
may
be
put
before
the
jury
that
it
would
be
put
before
the
judge
if
he
were
taking
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
sentence
should
be.
and
that’s,
[voice
overlap]
that’s
very
broad.
but
there
are
limits
and
one
of
the
most
important
limits
for
instance
is
the
limit
imposed
by
the
morris
rule.
i
should
think
that
a
very
relevant
circumstance
in
determining
whether
one
should
have
life
or
death
is
to
consider
the
possibilities
that
a
life
term
might
not
be
a
life
term,
that
the
man
even
though
not
rehabilitated
might
be
out
on
the
street
sometime
within
a
comparatively
short
period
of
years.
and
yet
that’s
one
of
the
importance
that
they
can’t
be
told,
they
can’t
be
evidence
about
it
and
it
can’t
be
argued.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
no
but
on
the
other
hand
if
he
can
be
told
what
the
parole
system
is
like
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
out
on
the
street
under
an
adult
authority
performing
his
function,
it
might
be
helpful.
if
the
jury
were
worried
as
california
suggest
was
the
case
here.
if
the
jury
were
worrying
about
turning
a
murder
loose
on
the
streets,
they
might
be
very
well
want
to
know
how
effective
or
ineffective
as
the
case
may
be
the
parole
system
was.
now,
it
could
be
helpful
to
the
defendant,
it
could
be
harmful
to
him.
the
essential
point
from
the
standpoint
of
the
constitution
is
that
the
jury
have
been
given
something
relevant
and
something
that
under
a
proper
set
of
standards
they
would
be
told.
it
was
a
factor
to
take
into
account
and
how
to
take
it
into
account.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
nothing
that
i
suggest
is
a
necessary
part
of
any
set
of
standards
beyond
the
fact
that
it
should
set
some
kind
of
a
basis,
some
kind
of
a
propositional
rule
that
would
govern
the
deliberation.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no
not
anymore,
not
since
morris.
they
could
have
at
one
time
and
that’s
how
the
problem
arose.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
the
jury
inquired
about
the
possibility
of
parole
and
the
judge
then
gave
them
the
so
called
morris
instruction
which
was
prepared
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
morris
opinion
to
be
given
in
that
situation.
what
that
instruction
comes
down
to
is
that
yes,
he
can
be
paroled
but
it’s
really
none
of
your
concern
in
fixing
sentence.
and
it
says
so
in
this
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
what
i
want
is
the
right
to
have
standard,
leaving
it
to
the
legislation
to
determine
what
those
standards
should
be.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
may
not
benefit
the
petitioner.
i
mentioned
it
to
show
that
the
rules
of
evidence
aren’t
completely
down
so
far
as
the
penalty
hearing
is
concerned.
there
are
limits
up
to
which
that
the
prosecution
can
not
exceed.
there
are
limits
that
the
defendant
can
not
exceed.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
no,
your
honor.
it
would
have
been
an
idle
act
for
and
to
have
done
so
because
in
the
health
case
which
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
and
in
the
case
has
been
decided
since.
instructions
that
would
have
told
the
jury
they
could
do
take
this
into
account
and
they
should
give
such
significance
to
these
various
things
have
been
held
properly
refused.
it
would
have
been
a
completely
idle
act
to
have
asked.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
they
could
ask,
yes.
they
can
ask
but
when
they
start
going
beyond
the
kind
of
an
instruction
that
i
have
read
and
start
specifying
specific
thing
specific
things
bearing
upon
aggravation
or
mitigation
as
the
case
may
be
on
litigation
of
courts
when
it
comes
to
defense,
our
supreme
court
has
consistently
ruled
that
that’s
proper.
it
was
not
error.
the
refusals
instructions
because
as
they
said
in
the
holt
case,
the
instruction
that
i
read
to,
he
was
given
and
that’s
enough
and
that’s
all
that
they’re
entitled
to.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
the
sense,
they
are
judicially
created
limitations
on
the
extent
to
which
the
jury
can
go.
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
that
jury
is
adjourned
completely.
let
say,
they
are
given
that
proprietary
charge,
don’t
be
arbitrary,
don’t
be
influence
by
public
opinion.
i’m
a
little
of
a
lost
how
to
reconcile
but
don’t
be
influenced
by
public
opinion
or
public
feeling
and
the
conscience
of
the
community
that
they
are
suppose
to
represent
and
to
which
they
are
supposed
to
give
force
when
they
are
ready.
i
see
my
time
is
up
your
honors.
i
thank
you.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
to
review
a
judgment
of
death
imposed
by
a
jury
upon
the
petitioner
after
his
conviction
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
the
question
that
is
raised
and
to
which
the
granting
of
certiorari
was
limited,
is
whether
california’s
procedure
of
imposing
the
death
penalty
by
leaving
the
choice
of
penalty
to
the
jury
in
its
absolute
discretion,
unguided
and
uncontrolled
by
any
standards
fixed
by
law
is
a
denial
of
due
process
that
there
are
no
standards
governing
the
process
on
this
law
of
california.
as
a
fact,
it
has
been
noted
of
many
times
by
the
highest
court
of
that
state
and
the
jury
in
this
case
was
told
that
in
so
many
words.
but
to
them
and
in
their
absolute
discretion
was
confided
the
choice
of
penalty
for
which
choice
the
law
fix
no
standards.
it
is
by
plan
to
discus
that
question
for
what
it
is,
a
question
of
law,
not
one
of
penology,
not
one
of
policy.
the
question
of
does
not
necessarily
implicate
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
per
se.
it
is
aimed
primarily
so
far
as
our
presentation
is
concerned
at
the
procedure.
the
standardless
procedure
by
which
california
imposes
the
penalty,
that
being
so,
i
suggest
that
we
are
brought
to
grips
with
first
principles
arising
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
main
purpose,
the
basic
purpose
of
that
clause
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
is
to
prevent
government
from
imposing
burdens
upon
a
person
from
depriving
a
person
of
his
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
save
as
this
court
set
expressed
at
one
case,
save
by
the
valid
laws
of
the
land.
now,
that
does
not
mean
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
first
cases
of
the
rules
after
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
been
adopted.
that
does
not
mean
any
law
that
a
legislature
may
enact.
it
means
only
those
laws
that
are
consistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
amendment,
that
purpose
being
in
a
few
words
to
impose
upon
the
judicial
process
and
the
legislative
process
too
for
that
matter,
the
rule
of
law.
it
is
a
requirement
because
it
is
inherent
in
that
purpose
that
law
shall
mean
not
something
for
the
occasion
or
for
the
moment
but
some
fixed
and
ascertainable
standards
by
which
a
rule
is
established.
not
merely
so
that
individuals
may
be
able
to
conduct
themselves
in
conformity
to
the
law,
but
as
well
so
that
the
courts
may
determine
whether
in
fact
they
have
conducted
themselves
in
conformity
with
the
law.
in
other
words,
the
rule
of
law
established
by
the
due
process
clause,
i
submit,
imposes
a
rule
of
decision
or
standards
for
a
rule
of
decision
as
well
as
standards
for
a
rule
of
conduct.
we’d
have,
i
suggest
no
trouble.
no
trouble
with
that
concept
if
what
were
before
this
court
was
statute
of
a
sort
said
for
instance
that
murder
was
simply
any
killing.
that
in
the
absolute
discretion
of
a
jury
was
determined
to
be
deserving
of
some
kind
of
punishment.
we
would
have
no
trouble
because
the
rule
is
thoroughly
established.
that
a
statute
must
so
define
proscribed
conduct
as
to
enable
not
only
the
person
to
conduct
himself
lawfully
but
enable
to
a
court
to
determine
whether
he
has
conducted
himself
lawfully.
if
that
is
so,
if
that
is
so
in
respect
of
the
determination
of
guilt,
why
should
it
not
be
in
respect
of
the
imposition
of
penalty?
the
process
by
which
a
person
is
deprived
of
his
life
is
not
a
fragmented
process
even
though
the
actual
trial
may
as
it
is
in
california
be
divided
into
two
stages.
it
is
one
process
from
accusation
through
the
final
imposition
of
sentence
and
there
is
nothing,
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
provides
that
it
shall
be
applicable
only
to
a
part
rather
than
the
whole
of
that
process
and
as
this
court
has
said
in
that
connection.
the
sentencing
procedure
is
not
immune
to
scrutiny
under
the
due
process
clause.
well
then
if
in
respect
of
determination
of
guilt,
the
rule
of
law
imports
that
necessity
for
standards
does
it
not
in
respect
of
the
sentence.
the
sentence
after
all
is
the
final
culmination
of
the
process
by
which
the
defendant
is
to
be
deprived
of
its
life
or
liberty
as
the
case
may
be.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
since
1957,
i
believe
your
honor.
it’s
been
quite
a
while.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
since
that
bifurcated
procedure,
yes
your
honor.
and
indeed,
even
before
the
bifurcated
procedure,
the
jury
had
fixed
the
punishment
for
good
many
years.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
not
necessarily.
my
submission
then
would
be
alternatively.
the
first
answer
i
would
make
is
that
if
standards
are
required
of
the
sentencing
power,
they
are
required
of
the
judge
as
well
as
of
the
jury.
but
the
cases
of
the
judges
are
classifiably
different
situation.
and
the
legislature
might
well
distinguish
between
the
two.
there
is
the
matter
of
the
judge’s
special
training
and
experience
and
expertise.
there
is
his
greater
knowledge
of
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
criminal
law,
a
knowledge
that
goes
beyond
that
which
an
ordinary
person
could
be
supposed
or
deemed
to
have.
and
there
is
the
coordination
of
his
own
action,
his
own
exercise
of
discretion
to
what
he
determines
from
his
experience
and
from
his
knowledge
of
the
law
are
the
objectives
and
the
aims
of
punishment.
that
being
so,
the
likelihood
that
he
would
arrive
about
a
result
intended
or
dictated
by
the
law
as
distinguished
from
personal
preference
or
personal
reaction
in
this
situation
is
so
much
greater
that
a
legislature
could
very
well
classify
between
the
two
and
insulate
that
classification
in
submission
for
many
contention
on
writable
protection
of
due
process.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well
it
is
less
indicative,
it
is
not
necessarily.
so
of
course,
i
recognize
as
california
argues
that
there
were
factors
in
the
evidence
upon
which
a
jury
might
rationally
have
made
a
difference
between
the
two
men.
the
vice
is
we
don’t
know
that
that’s
what
they
did.
the
particular
vices
they
weren’t
told
that
the
law
makes
whatever
it
is
they
may
have
decided
in
that
connection,
a
distinguishable
or
not
a
distinguishable
but
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
men.
we,
--
the
california
has
said
that
the
jury
undoubtedly
determined
that
mcgautha
was
the
triggerman.
well,
i
would
say
that’s
a
pretty
good
guess
but
it
is
by
no
means
an
unelectable
inference
or
even
an
inference
that
probably
should
be
drawn.
the
evidence
on
that
score
was
in
sharp
conflict
and
under
a
statute
imposing
standards
of
a
sort
for
instance
that
we
find
in
the
model
penal
code.
notwithstanding
that
the
jury
ex
hypothesi
was
satisfied
that
mcgautha
pulled
the
trigger.
there
might
have
been
because
of
the
sharp
conflict,
enough
doubt
in
their
mind
so
that
under
an
appropriate
instruction,
they
could
have
treated
that
doubt
as
mitigating
circumstance.
now
i
am
not
saying
the
constitution
requires
that
that
be
treated
as
a
mitigating
circumstance,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
that’s
an
indication
of
the
kind
of
standards
that
could
be
framed,
that
could
be
imposed
and
that
might
lead
to
the
very
result
understandably
and
inferably
at
which
here
california
only
guesses.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
there
is
testimony.
mr.
wilkinson
testified
in
the
fact
that
it
was
mcgautha.
mcgautha
testified
in
the
fact
that
it
was
wilkinson.
there
are
some
evidence
from
the
proprietor
of
the
store,
the
lady
involved
describing
the
activities
of
the
two
men.
describing
the
activity
of
one
of
the
man
who
from
her
description
of
the
size
and
coloration
and
the
rest
must
have
been
mcgautha,
which
was
inconsistent
with
mcgautha
having
been
being
able
to
fire
the
shot.
as
i
say,
the
evidence
on
that
score
was
in
sharp
conflict.
and
the
part
then
--
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
in
conflict
within
the
prosecutions
own
case,
the
jury
didn’t
have
to
wait
till
the
penalty
faces
a
trial
for
that
conflict
to
develop
cause
neither
of
the
defendants
took
the
stand
in
the
guilt
phase.
but
from
the
ballistic
testimony
on
the
one
hand,
the
testimony
of
the
proprietor
distort
on
the
other.
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
prosecution’s
case
about
which
one
of
the
two
fired
the
shot.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
that
the
legislature
--
yes,
could
classify
the
judge
differently
and
treat
the
judge
situation
as
different
from
that
of
the
jury
because
of
the
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i’d
say,
i
distinguish
between
the
judge
and
the
jury
in
respect
of
their
expertise
in
the
law.
so
far
as
the
conscience
of
the
community
is
concerned
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that
when
he
considers
the
aims
and
objects
of
punishment,
when
he
considers
the
material,
the
information
that
the
normal
practice
every
judge
gets
by
way
of
pre-sentence
reports,
probation
reports
and
the
like.
i
think
that
there
is
a
considered
and
designed
effort
to
impose
the
particular
penalty
into
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
in
judge’s
opinion
as
an
expert
of
the
law,
is
what
the
law
had
in
mind
as
a
general
policy.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
simply
as
a
question
of
law
simply
because
the
statute
did
nothing
that
necessarily
imposes
upon
on
a
state,
a
sharply
defined
division
between
the
functions
of
judge
and
jury
in
the
case.
the
common
law
for
many
years
and
it
wasn’t
it
until
facts’
act
and
others,
the
jury
decided
the
law
in
libel
cases
among
other
things.
that
was
submitted
to
them.
it
is
not
unknown
to
the
law
that
questions
of
law
may
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
but
when
they
are,
i
suggest
they
generally
admitted
under
recharge
that
attempts
at
least
to
put
before
the
jury,
the
considerations
of
the
law
considers
to
be
determinants
of
decision
and
that
is
what
the
california
procedure
does
not
do.
now,
if
i
may
say
just
a
word,
if
your
honor
please,
about
the
conscience
of
the
community.
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
jury
does
reflect
the
conscience
of
the
community.
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
a
link
between
the
community
and
the
jury
is
an
important
part
of
our
judicial
system,
but
that
link
must
be
maintained
and
that
conscience
must
be
exercised
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
and
the
jury
must
have
those
limits,
explained
to
it
and
those
limits
must
be
fixed
to
the
extent
that
they
need
to
be
made
specific
by
the
law.
i
need
only
cite
by
way
of
example
to
comparatively
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
reitman
against
mulkey
at
initiative
measure
expressing
the
conscience
of
the
california
community
overwhelmingly
and
directly
in
adopting
a
certain
constitutional
amendment,
and
california
was
held
on
unconstitutional
by
this
court
notwithstanding
that
it
was
the
direct
expression
of
the
conscience
of
community.
in
lucas,
an
initiative
reapportioning
the
colorado
legislature
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
notwithstanding
that
it
represented
the
voice
of
the
community.
what
i
am
saying
is
and
what
those
cases
illustrate
is
that
conscience
is
in
itself
not
an
unbridle
things
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
it
is
confined
by
the
constitution
just
as
much
as
the
legislature,
the
judiciary
or
the
executive
is
confined.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
think
of
in
california.
california
has
the
indeterminate
sentence
law.
there
is
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases
in
other
jurisdictions,
i
understand.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
suppose
that’s
a
purely
logical
or
abstract
question,
the
answer
is
yes,
that
it
should
be.
but
there
again,
do
we
not
have
a
classifiably
different
situation.
in
the
first
place,
the
range
is
a
difference
in
degree,
not
in
kind
as
it
is
in
the
capital
sentencing
case.
the
sentence
is
a
much
more
irrevocable
fact
once
it
is
established.
the
jury
deals
them
with
the
type
of
situation
and
the
pressures
and
the
tensions
and
the
simple
means
that
lead
to
them
with
which
they
are
much
more
likely
to
be
familiar
in
the
ordinary
run
of
life
than
they
are
to
be
familiar
with
what
it
is
that
motivates
someone
who
has
killed
another
human
being.
well,
that’s
a
very
rough
idea
if
you
are
to
please
of
factors
again
that
make
non-capital
jury
sentencing
a
classifiably
different
situation.
i
take
it
that
the
constitution
certainly
doesn’t
require
complete
conformity
or
uniformity.
it
certainly
does
not
require
logical
perfection.
there
must
be
some
room
in
the
joints
to
work.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
holmes’
famous
phrase.
and
some
latitude
must
be
found
in
these
things.
let
me
say
just
a
word
if
i
may
before
i
reserve
what’s
left
of
my
time
to
reply.
i
mentioned
briefly
what
seems
to
be
the
argument
in
opposition
to
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
this
case.
so
far
as
california
is
concerned,
about
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
the
penalty
phase
of
a
murder
trial
in
california
is
a
pretty
fair
(inaudible)
and
all
relevant
evidence
is
submitted,
procedural
niceties
are
observed,
and
review
of
errors
of
law
is
provided
for.
well,
that
begs
the
question.
the
question
is,
our
standards
are
necessary
and
if
they
are,
are
they
given
to
the
jury
as
the
rule
of
law
imposed
in
that
phase
of
the
case
or
isn’t
it?
it
isn’t
enough
to
say
that
the
trial
in
its
non-sentencing
procedural
aspect
is
a
fair
trial.
the
argument
proves
too
much.
you
could
say
exactly
the
same
thing
about
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
and
yet
even
california
would
not
argue
that
the
question
of
guilt
vel
non,
not
guilt
vel
non,
but
definition
of
the
alleged
crime
could
be
left
to
the
jury
without
any
guidelines
or
standards
or
without
any
fixing
by
the
legislature.
the
argument
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
be
that
jury
sentencing
is
an
old
practice.
and
being
an
old
practice,
we
should
retain.
at
least
the
question
that
it
was
--
the
fact
that
it
is
unconstitutional
has
never
been
strongly
enough
urged
apparently
to
have
it
decided
--
to
have
it
decided
that
it
was.
well,
this
court
at
the
close
of
last
turn
seems
to
me
answered
that
kind
of
an
argument.
the
argument
incidentally
also
begs
the
question
because
it
doesn’t
come
to
grips
with
the
proposition
of
whether
due
process
of
law
means
law
in
the
sense
of
standards.
but
the
answer
was
made
by
this
court
in
williams
against
illinois.
neither
the
antiquity
of
the
practice
nor
steadfast
judicial
or
legislative
adherence
to
it
insulates
it
from
attack
under
the
constitution.
and
it
is
that
attack
under
the
constitution
that
we
make
here
primarily
for
the
reason
to
put
it
into
one
short
sentence
that
it
ignores
the
basic
purpose
of
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
to
establish
the
rule
of
law
throughout
the
entire
case,
not
just
a
part
of
it.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
will
say
it
first
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
my
argument
that
it
be
unconstitutional.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
on
balance,
it
would
not
be.
now
the
question
might
arise
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause.
it
might
arise
under
the
due
process
clause.
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
the
argument
that
has
satisfied
my
mind
and
my
own
reflection
on
it
is
that
there
were
a
160
somewhat
crimes
for
which
the
death
penalty
was
a
standard
procedure
to
timely
--
to
time
that
amendment
of
the
constitution
was
adopted.
so
far,
as
due
process
is
concerned,
i
suppose
it
gets
down
ultimately
to
the
question
whether
there
was
such
a
compelling
interest
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
retribution
of
factor
in
the
criminal
law
as
to
justify
taking
ones
life.
because
i
would
submit
that
only
a
compelling
interest
can
justify
the
taking
of
ones
life
even
for
the
commission
of
a
heinous
crime.
but
if
retribution
is
not
such
a
compelling
interest,
then
rehabilitation
and
protection
of
society
at
all
will
rest
of
the
purposes
of
the
punishment
that
can
be
encompassed
and
can
be
furthered
by
a
life
imprisonment,
but
then
will
leave
the
answer
to
the
question
--
let
me
say,
at
least
in
doubt.
but
primarily
from
the
standpoint
of
are
more
or
less
limited
attack
on
the
california
procedure.
there
is
nothing
that
needs
to
be
decided
in
that
connection
that
in
anyway
implicates
the
death
penalty
per
se.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
it
is
capriciously
more
lenient.
it
does
not
--
you
see
california,
california
hasn’t
expressed
any
preference
for
one
penalty
rather
than
the
other.
our
supreme
court
has
said
so
time
and
time
again
and
in
fact
the
juries
told
that
and
just
about
those
words.
the
trouble
with
the
california
situation
is
that
the
penalty
for
murder
has
not
been
fixed
by
the
law.
now
that’s
quite
a
different
thing,
i
submit,
from
saying
the
penalty
is
death
but
someone,
be
at
the
jury,
the
judge
the
governor,
or
some
administrative
commission
has
the
power
do
we
dispense
clemency.
in
that
case,
an
argument
could
be
made.
i
don’t
have
to
make
it
but
an
argument
could
be
made
at
the
requirement
of
standards
does
not
apply
because
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
mercy.
but
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
know
what
it
is
that
you
can
and
can’t
do
and
what
happens
to
you
if
you
do
it.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
so
far
as
the
legislature
is
concerned,
when
it
defines
the
crime
with
constitutional
adequacy
and
says
the
penalty
for
that
crime
is
one
thing
or
the
other,
it
has
by
necessary
--
by
implicitly
set
the
standard
and
it
has
the
legislative
power
within
the
confines
of
the
constitution
to
set
the
standard.
so
far
as
the
judge
is
concerned,
i’ve
answered
that
question
somewhat
ramblingly
before
i
think
it’s
classifiably
different
situation
the
legislature
might
do
it
and
that
justification
for
doing
it
would
be
found
in
the
strong
likelihood
that
the
judges
knowledge
and
sense
of
obligation
and
more
particularly
his
knowledge
of
the
objectives
of
the
criminal
law
would
in
effect
see
to
it
that
the
sentence
is
oppose
in
accordance
with
the
law’s
purposes
and
intentions
in
the
matter.
that
is
in
substance
but
the
california
court
so
set
with
respect
to
it’s
indeterminate
sentence
law
except
that
they
find
from
the
language
of
the
statute
some
rather
more
specific
standards
than
that
but
it
comes
down
at
to
the
same
thing
that
having
set
the
generalized
standards
than
that
but
it
comes
down
at
the
same
thing
at
having
set
the
generalized
standards
the
objective
of
the
statute,
it’s
then
permissible
for
the
legislature
to
imposed
on
one
having
the
necessary
qualifications
of
expertise,
the
job
of
seeing
whether
those
standards
are
met
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
due
to
the
difficulties
of
practicing
laws
on
3000
miles
from
the
seat
of
the
court
and
more
importantly
from
the
location
of
the
brief
printer,
the
reply
brief
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
was
not
available
until
this
morning.
in
fact,
i
only
received
my
copy
this
morning.
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
that
fact
because
some,
not
all,
of
what
i
am
about
to
say
in
reply
is
covered
i
think
more
grammatically
in
any
event
in
that
brief.
it
isn’t
long
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
the
reply
brief,
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
think
that’s
november
6.
yes,
november
6,
yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
i
just
got
my
copy
this
morning.
i
didn’t
--
perhaps,
i
was
confused
by
the
fact
that
the
(inaudible)
of
time
didn’t
permit
the
printer
to
send
proof
to
me.
so,
you
may
find
a
couple
of
typos
and
i’m
sure
you’ll
find
some
awkwardness
of
language
that
might
have
been
ironed
out
that
i
have
approved
it.
in
any
event,
there
are
two
or
three
preliminary
matters
referred
to
by
the
state
of
california
that
i
think
i
should
mention.
whether
this
case
will
affect
the
faith
of
some
550
other
prisoners
is
the
fact
that
none
of
us
i
suppose
can
escape
considering.
in
the
cases
of
those
550
or
very
likely
most
of
them,
whether
this
case
will
affect
them
or
not
will
depend
pretty
largely
on
the
decision
that
is
ultimately
laid
as
to
whether
this
case
assuming
a
result
favorable
to
the
present
petitioner
would
have
retroactive
effect.
i
mentioned
that
for
only
one
reason,
this
is
mcgautha’s
first
time
around.
he
is
still
on
direct
review
of
his
original
sentence.
there
is
no
question
or
element
or
retroactivity
that
needs
to
be
decided
so
far
as
he
is
concerned.
and
i
submit
with
all
the
earnestness
that
i
can,
that
not
withstanding
the
traditional
processes
by
which
a
determination
between
two
individuals
or
between
the
state
and
an
individual
may
have
an
effect
upon
the
law
generally
and
have
an
effect
upon
the
cases
abolished
cannot
implicate
mcgautha’s
constitutional
right
whatever
they
may
be.
it
is
no
approval
necessarily
either
by
counsel
or
by
the
court
of
the
crime
of
which
mcgautha
was
found
guilty
to
determine
that
he
is
entitled
to
be
found
guilty
and
entitled
to
be
sent
to
his
doom
if
it
all,
only
by
the
processes
of
law
required
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
that
is
what
he
sees
here.
now,
reference
has
been
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
california
to
the
number
of
reversals
that
have
emanated
from
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
death
penalty
cases.
it’s
true
there
have
been
a
pretty
large
percentage
of
reversals,
none
of
them
for
reasons
involving
anything
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
have
as
your
honors
are
certainly
aware
from
reading
california’s
brief
and
reading
our
brief
in
this
case.
we
have
in
california
something
called
the
morris
rule
which
prohibits
argument
or
evidence
about
what
the
adult
authority
may
do
in
the
way
of
paroling
a
life
termer.
most,
not
most
of
those
reversals
with
a
very
large
part
of
them
went
off
on
that
particular
local
rule
of
practice.
a
great
many
of
them
went
of
on
witherspoon
grounds
after
this
court
came
down
with
witherspoon
and
may
i
say
they
went
all
upon
witherspoon
grounds
somewhat
grudgingly
so
far
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
concerned
but
nevertheless
they
went
off
from
those.
nothing
in
that
series
of
reversal
has
anything
would
ever
to
do
with
a
proposition
that
the
absence
of
standards
nevertheless
assures
a
defendant
but
the
question
of
his
penalty
will
be
decided
by
the
law
rather
than
by
the
personal
reactions
of
the
jurors
unguided
and
uncontrolled.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
i
have
nothing.
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
that
in
the
way
of
a
suggestion
for
a
minimal
standard
beyond
the
references
to
the
work
of
the
american
law
institute.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
to
a
considerable
extent
perhaps
it
is.
if
not,
well,
he
run
and
know
not
exactly
of
language
except
as
language
channels
thought
and
consideration.
and
confines
thought
and
consideration
to
the
channels
into
which
the
law
wants
it
to
flow.
and
that
i
suggest
that
is
the
important
thing
about
standards
for
a
jury.
instead
of
living
them
completely
at
large,
it
tells
them,
“these
are
the
things
you
want
to
be
thinking
about
and
deciding
whether
to
put
this
man
to
death
or
to
give
him
a
life
term
just
to
say
are
told
in
the
case
of
guilt.
what
do
you
want
to
be
thinking
about?
was
there
premeditation?
was
there
malice
aforethought?
what
there
appropriate
identification
and
so
on
right
down
the
line?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
from
last
part.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
would
suggest
something
that
perhaps
that
needs
an
elaboration
or
a
specification
of
the
general
suggestion
that
i
made
on
the
footnote
on
page
27.
i
myself
so
far
as
my
own
thinking
on
the
subject
concern
have
somewhat
taken
by
the
approach
of
the
american
law
institute
which
is
much
more
specific
and
yet
flexible
enough
than
the
approach
that
i
have
taken.
and
incidentally,
the
commission
to
study
the
revision
of
the
federal
criminal
code
as
taken
substantially
the
same
kind
of
an
approach
although
not
exactly
the
same,
they
differ.
the
fact
that
those
two
commissions,
studying
the
problem
from
conscientious
and
scientific
point
of
view
arrived
at
a
general
propositions
that
was
alike
but
different.
it
shows
that
this
is
not
a
delicate
question
of
federal
state
relationships
since
the
solicitor
has
made
it.
the
states
will
be
left
free
within
a
very
broad
range
to
frame
whatever
standards
they
think
fit
the
conscience
and
standards
of
their
own
particular
community.
all
of
the
constitution
would
require
is
minimal
standard.
now,
it’s
true
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
nothing.
the
fourteenth
says
nothing
about
standards.
may
i
suggest
but
it
says
nothing.
it
says
nothing
about
a
statute
defining
a
crime
being
so
certain
that
a
person
will
know
what
it
is
that
he
can
or
cannot
do.
doesn’t
say
anything
but
there’s
no
question
if
that’s
what
it
means
to
saying
anything
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
the
latter
is
the
american
law
institute
approach
and
the
approach
of
the
commission
studying
the
revision
of
the
federal
criminal
code.
it
is
the
approach
that
i
personally
prefer
because
it
is
specific.
it
gives
the
jury
something
they
can
get
their
teeth
into.
it
gives
them
something
concretely
that
can
be
discuss
in.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
no,
no,
not
that
at
all
without
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
think
as
minimal
standards,
yes.
if
they
can
be
general
standard
i
would,
while
it’s
a
much
less
serious
thing,
i
think
you
would
find
an
analogy
as
to
form
in
the
decisions
relating
the
delegation
of
legislative
power
to
administrative
agencies.
the
standard
that
must
accompany
such
a
delegation
can
be
a
very
general
and
a
very
broad
one.
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
specific
and
not
to
indicate
to
the
body
who
its
given
the
power
what
it
is
that
the
delegating
body
thinks
they
ought
to
be
doing
and
how
they
ought
to
go
about
doing
it
now.
i
realized
solicitor
general
propositions,
if
we
want
--
if
a
state
wants
the
specific,
it
finds
a
model
in
the
model
penal
code.
it
can
work
with
that.
if
it
wants
something
that’s
broad
and
general
and
has
much
flexibility,
as
much
room
for
what
has
been
called
the
conscience
of
the
community
as
it
is
possible,
still
keeping
the
operation
of
that
conscience
confined
within
the
broad
boundaries.
it
can
take
the
kind
of
approach
that
i
have
suggested.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
my
opinion
they
would.
i
think
so.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
not
at
all
and
i
am
happy
at
the
opportunity
to
make
that
clear.
we
are
not.
i
am
not
seeking
a
result
that
will
impose
upon
the
50
states
of
this
union,
a
uniform
necessarily
adoptable
procedure
with
respect
to
standard.
they’ve
got
as
much
scope
there.
it
seems
to
me
as
they
have
been
defining
which
constitute
murder
--
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
or
the
murder
at
varying
degrees.
and
while
i’m
in
that,
may
i
interject
that
it
has
nothing
really
to
do
with
what
i
have
just
been
saying
except
with
the
use
of
murder
suggested
to
me.
it’s
true
that
mr.
mcgautha
is
a
four-time
loser
in
the
language
of
mr.
george.
all
of
those
four
convictions
were
in
the
state
of
texas
beginning
i
think
when
he
had
attained
the
ripe
age
of
17.
one
of
those
was
for
the
crime
that
in
texas
it
is
called
murder
without
malice.
now,
murder
without
malice
is
a
somewhat
pejorative
name
for
what
elsewhere
is
called
manslaughter.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
that
makes
a
lighter,
trivial
offense,
of
course
it
doesn’t.
but
it
is
still
not
quite
the
serious
thing
that
is
implied
by
the
word
murder
without
any
explanation
or
qualification.
now,
my
reason
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
at
the
time
of
that?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
don’t
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
this
crime,
i
think
he
was
in
his
early
40’s,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
early
40’s,
41
i
believe,
the
evidence
says
41.
he
had
been
in
california,
i
think
just
a
few
years
before
that
time
having
spent
about
half
of
the
time
from
--
he
became
17
years
of
age
until
he
moved
to
california
having
spent
about
half
of
that
time
in
texas
penitentiary.
he
was
convicted
four
times.
he
did
serve
in
the
armed
forces
in
between
apparently
without
trouble.
now,
having
spent
perhaps
too
much
time
on
what
my
personal
ideas
are
about
what
the
jury
should
be
told
in
respect
to
standards.
i
would
like
to
read
very
briefly
what
mcgautha’s
jury
was
told
and
whatever
california
jury
in
this
kind
of
a
case
is
told
particularly
because
it
disposes
i
submit
of
california’s
argument
that
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial
is
so
fair
and
so
scrupulously
guarded,
that
anything
that
the
defendant
wants
to
put
before
the
jury
can
go
in
and
the
jury
will
know
what
it
is
they
can
do
with
that
evidence.
and
this
is
what
the
jury
has
told.
i
am
not
going
to
read
the
whole
long
instruction
but
the
parts
that
go
really
to
the
question
of
standard.
“it
is
the
law
of
the
state,”
page
222
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
“it
is
the
law
of
the
state
that
every
person
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
shall
suffer
death
or
confinement
in
the
state
imprison
for
life
at
the
discretion
of
the
jury.”
and
then
it
says
a
few
--choose
one
or
the
other
you
may
say
so
and
then
it
goes
on.
notwithstanding
facts
isn’t
proved
in
mitigation
or
aggravation
in
determining
which
punishment
shall
be
inflicted,
you
are
entirely
free
to
act
according
to
your
role
of
judgment,
conscience
and
absolute
discretion.
that
verdict
must
express
the
individual
opinion
of
each
juror.
they
don’t
even
have
to
agree
on
the
reasons
why
they
are
going
to
give
death
or
life
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
but
it’s
an
indication
of
the
extent
to
which
the
procedure
is
completely
uncontrolled
or
unconfined
by
law,
by
standards,
by
criteria
as
to
what
the
law
says
are
the
determinants
that
go
into
making
a
decision,
a
judicial
decision.
no,
i
don’t
say
that
they
have
to
agree
on
all
reasons.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
they
could,
yes,
except
if
they
disagreed
on
whether
there
was
or
was
not
premeditation
for
instance
actually
having
regard
with
the
definition
of
murder
in
california
that
might
not
be
a
valid
verdict.
there,
they
all
have
to
agree
that
there
was
premeditation.
and
they
all
have
to
agree
that
there
was
malice
and
they
all
have
to
agree
that
it
was
the
defendant
who
did
it.
while
that
charge
goes
on
and
this
is
the
important
thing
because
despite
all
of
these
evidence,
despite
everything
that
goes
in,
this
is
what
they
are
told
about
the
extent
to
which
they
can
deal
with
the
situation
on
their
own.
now,
beyond
prescribing
the
two
alternative
penalties,
the
law
itself
provides
no
standard
for
the
guidance
of
the
jury
in
selection
of
a
penalty.
but
rather
commits
the
whole
matter
of
determining
which
of
the
penalties
should
be
fixed
to
the
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion
of
a
jury.
in
the
determination
of
that
matter
if
the
jury
does
agree
it
must
be
unanimous.
and
that’s
what
they’re
told.
despite
everything
that
may
have
been
put
before
them.
it
is
a
matter
entirely
of
their
judgment
conscience
and
absolute
discretion.
now,
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
they
are
told
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
there
are
some.
they
are
not
as
broad
--
i
mean
they
are
not
as
narrow
as
perhaps
might
be
the
case.
i
think
the
general
rule
in
california
is
that
anything
may
be
put
before
the
jury
that
it
would
be
put
before
the
judge
if
he
were
taking
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
sentence
should
be.
and
that’s,
[voice
overlap]
that’s
very
broad.
but
there
are
limits
and
one
of
the
most
important
limits
for
instance
is
the
limit
imposed
by
the
morris
rule.
i
should
think
that
a
very
relevant
circumstance
in
determining
whether
one
should
have
life
or
death
is
to
consider
the
possibilities
that
a
life
term
might
not
be
a
life
term,
that
the
man
even
though
not
rehabilitated
might
be
out
on
the
street
sometime
within
a
comparatively
short
period
of
years.
and
yet
that’s
one
of
the
importance
that
they
can’t
be
told,
they
can’t
be
evidence
about
it
and
it
can’t
be
argued.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
no
but
on
the
other
hand
if
he
can
be
told
what
the
parole
system
is
like
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
out
on
the
street
under
an
adult
authority
performing
his
function,
it
might
be
helpful.
if
the
jury
were
worried
as
california
suggest
was
the
case
here.
if
the
jury
were
worrying
about
turning
a
murder
loose
on
the
streets,
they
might
be
very
well
want
to
know
how
effective
or
ineffective
as
the
case
may
be
the
parole
system
was.
now,
it
could
be
helpful
to
the
defendant,
it
could
be
harmful
to
him.
the
essential
point
from
the
standpoint
of
the
constitution
is
that
the
jury
have
been
given
something
relevant
and
something
that
under
a
proper
set
of
standards
they
would
be
told.
it
was
a
factor
to
take
into
account
and
how
to
take
it
into
account.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
nothing
that
i
suggest
is
a
necessary
part
of
any
set
of
standards
beyond
the
fact
that
it
should
set
some
kind
of
a
basis,
some
kind
of
a
propositional
rule
that
would
govern
the
deliberation.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no
not
anymore,
not
since
morris.
they
could
have
at
one
time
and
that’s
how
the
problem
arose.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
the
jury
inquired
about
the
possibility
of
parole
and
the
judge
then
gave
them
the
so
called
morris
instruction
which
was
prepared
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
morris
opinion
to
be
given
in
that
situation.
what
that
instruction
comes
down
to
is
that
yes,
he
can
be
paroled
but
it’s
really
none
of
your
concern
in
fixing
sentence.
and
it
says
so
in
this
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
what
i
want
is
the
right
to
have
standard,
leaving
it
to
the
legislation
to
determine
what
those
standards
should
be.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
it
may
not
benefit
the
petitioner.
i
mentioned
it
to
show
that
the
rules
of
evidence
aren’t
completely
down
so
far
as
the
penalty
hearing
is
concerned.
there
are
limits
up
to
which
that
the
prosecution
can
not
exceed.
there
are
limits
that
the
defendant
can
not
exceed.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
no,
your
honor.
it
would
have
been
an
idle
act
for
and
to
have
done
so
because
in
the
health
case
which
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
and
in
the
case
has
been
decided
since.
instructions
that
would
have
told
the
jury
they
could
do
take
this
into
account
and
they
should
give
such
significance
to
these
various
things
have
been
held
properly
refused.
it
would
have
been
a
completely
idle
act
to
have
asked.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
they
could
ask,
yes.
they
can
ask
but
when
they
start
going
beyond
the
kind
of
an
instruction
that
i
have
read
and
start
specifying
specific
thing
specific
things
bearing
upon
aggravation
or
mitigation
as
the
case
may
be
on
litigation
of
courts
when
it
comes
to
defense,
our
supreme
court
has
consistently
ruled
that
that’s
proper.
it
was
not
error.
the
refusals
instructions
because
as
they
said
in
the
holt
case,
the
instruction
that
i
read
to,
he
was
given
and
that’s
enough
and
that’s
all
that
they’re
entitled
to.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
the
sense,
they
are
judicially
created
limitations
on
the
extent
to
which
the
jury
can
go.
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
that
jury
is
adjourned
completely.
let
say,
they
are
given
that
proprietary
charge,
don’t
be
arbitrary,
don’t
be
influence
by
public
opinion.
i’m
a
little
of
a
lost
how
to
reconcile
but
don’t
be
influenced
by
public
opinion
or
public
feeling
and
the
conscience
of
the
community
that
they
are
suppose
to
represent
and
to
which
they
are
supposed
to
give
force
when
they
are
ready.
i
see
my
time
is
up
your
honors.
i
thank
you.
