justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
selvin,
am
i
correct
when
mr.
george
said
the
state
cannot
show
that?
that
it
is
mainly
getting
on
a
parole?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
in
this
case
they
couldn’t
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
you
want
the
rights
of
a
petitioner
to
put
that
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
wasn’t
worried
about
just
one
standard
you
suggested
which
i
don’t
understand
how
it
would
benefit
the
petitioner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
callahan,
in
ohio,
how
do
you
prolong
the
testimony
other
than
the
defense
that
would
be
for
sentencing
purposes
rather
than
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
no
place
can
put
on
the
usual
evidence
that’s
well
for
example
like
it’s
done
in
california
[voice
overlap]?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
resnick,
in
this
allocution
testimony
do
you
tell
us
that
in
ohio
in
the
trial
on
seat
you
can
put
witnesses
on
who
know
nothing
about
crime
at
all
but
just
being
the
nice
fellow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
prosecutor,
have
you
ever
been
worried
about
mother’s
testimony
urging
your
opinions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
prosecutor,
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
defendant’s
mother’s
testimony
right
in
your
case?
i’m
saying
that
general
(inaudible)
testimony.
people
in
the
neighborhood,
church
people,
you
don’t
put
that
on
the
regular
hearing
on
guilt,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
you
can
put
on
it
anytime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
witness
does
not
take
the
stand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i’m
talking
about
the
law
of
ohio,
if
the
defendant
does
not
take
a
stand
he
can
still
put
on
character
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
until
it’s
in
issue
it’s
not
in.
i
just
had
difficulty
in
seeing
that
he
has
all
of
the
benefits
of
a
sentencing
hearing
in
his
regular
trial
that’s
my
only
point.
there
must
be
some
difference
you
know
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
certainly,
he
cannot
tell
the
jury
which
he
could
do
and
in
sentencing
hearing,
“of
course,
i
admit
my
guilt
and
i’m
sorry
for
it
and
i
ask
for
mercy.”
of
course,
he
couldn’t
take
that
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
he
loses
that
much,
doesn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you
don’t
have
to
win
all
of
this
in
order
to
sustain
your
point
that’s
all.
otherwise,
it’s
a
little
broad.
