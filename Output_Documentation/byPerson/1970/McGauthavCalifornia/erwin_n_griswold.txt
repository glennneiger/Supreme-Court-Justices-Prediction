mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
invitation
of
the
court
and
with
the
assistance
of
mr.
lacovara,
we
have
tried
to
be
as
much
help
to
the
court
as
possible
in
this
difficult
matter.
before
i
begin
my
argument
i
would
like
to
make
two
emendations
in
the
brief
we
have
filed
and
the
first
is
in
the
tabulation
on
page
130
showing
the
chronological
development
of
the
introduction
of
jury
discretion
into
all
of
the
statutes
of
all
the
states
near
the
bottom
of
page
130.
there’s
a
reference
to
the
new
york
statute
at
which
they’re
dated
1937.
actually,
the
new
york
statute
of
1937
applied
only
to
felony
murders.
it
was
not
until
1963
that
new
york
extended
jury
discretion
to
all
murders
and
then
on
page
138
where
we
list
the
federal
statutes
authorizing
jury
discretion
they
first
to
the
federal
statute
there
cited
18
u.s.c.
837
(b).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
page
138.
the
first
to
the
federal
statute
18
u.s.c.
837
(b)
is
now
been
repealed
since
our
brief
was
filed
and
they
say
this
was
not
a
lack
of
foresight
on
our
part.
it
was
repealed
by
the
organize
crime
control
act
of
1970
signed
by
the
president
on
october
15
and
by
the
same
act
section
844
of
title
18
was
added
and
that
statute
gives
the
jury
or
the
judge
a
power
to
fix
the
death
penalty
thus
admitting
the
problem
disclosed
by
the
jackson
case.
because
of
the
importance
of
these
cases
this
case
in
the
following
one
it’s
especially
important
to
bear
in
mind
what
is
not
involved
here.
these
cases
do
not
directly
involve
the
general
question
of
the
validity
of
the
death
penalty
although
they
are
of
course
an
indirect
attack
on
that.
in
order
to
involve
any
question
of
the
application
of
the
death
penalty
in
cases
of
rape
at
which
was
involved
in
maxwell
against
bishop.
in
both
cases,
the
convictions
before
the
court
were
for
the
crime
of
murders.
and
finally,
there
is
no
suggestion
on
the
record
and
no
contention
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
that
there
has
been
discrimination
here
on
the
basis
of
race
either
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
in
the
evidence
presented
or
in
the
ruling
as
to
charge
of
the
trial
court.
in
this
case,
the
mcgautha
case
the
only
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
the
legislatures
of
the
states
and
congress
to
spell
out
what
are
called
standards
so
they’re
never
disclose
which
must
be
put
before
the
jury
as
a
part
of
the
process
by
which
they
determine
whether
the
penalty
for
the
particular
murder
shall
be
death
or
life
imprisonment.
that
question
too
is
involved
on
the
crampton
case
and
my
argument
here
will
be
applicable
to
that
case
too.
the
crampton
case
also
involves
the
additional
question
as
to
whether
the
constitution
then
requires
a
split
or
bifurcated
trials
separating
the
question
of
guilt
from
the
question
of
penalty
that
is
not
involved
here
as
california
does
provide
a
split
trial
and
i
will
discuss
that
in
the
time
allocated
to
me
for
argument
in
the
crampton
case.
both
of
these
questions
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
california
has
had
the
bifurcated
trial
since
1957
and
jury
discretion
came
into
california
in
1874
which
was
83
years
before.
california
was
one
of
the
relative
early
states
to
adopt
jury
discretion.
both
of
the
questions
in
these
two
cases
it
seems
to
me
fall
within
the
realm
of
federal
state
relationships
how
far
are
these
matters
which
fall
within
those
areas
which
ought
to
be
for
determination
by
the
several
states
or
are
they
matters
where
the
states
have
yielded
up
their
power
by
joining
the
federal
compact.
and
in
another
sense,
the
cases
may
be
thought
of
as
presenting
a
problem
of
separation
of
powers.
how
far
these
matters
for
determination
by
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
are
both
state
or
federal?
or
how
far
are
they
matters
for
determination
by
the
judiciary.
in
either
aspect,
the
questions
are
of
course
appropriate
for
decision
by
this
court
as
the
ultimate
arbiter
on
federal
constitutional
questions
for
the
nations.
with
respect
to
standards,
there
are
certain
things
that
are
clear.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
nothing
specific
in
the
constitution
relating
to
this
matter.
we
have
only
the
general
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
adopted
in
1790
that
congress
shall
not
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
a
provision
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1868.
perhaps,
it
may
be
said
that
the
concept
to
due
process
of
law
does
not
provide
standards
for
the
guidance
of
the
courts
on
this
question
and
is
not
nourish
for
that.
however,
it
is
clearly
a
very
general
concept
and
it
would
be
at
least
surprising
if
it
was
found
to
have
a
meaning
today
which
no
one
had
ever
conceive
it
had
a
doing
the
first
175
years
or
so
of
its
existence.
of
course,
i’m
familiar
with
holmes
statement
that
it’s
revolving
to
have
no
better
reason
for
a
rule
of
law
than
so
it
was
in
the
time
of
henry
ii.
but
it
is
also
equally
true
i
think
that
it
is
at
least
surprising
to
find
things
in
the
constitution
today
which
no
one
dreamed
were
there
as
recently
as
five
years
ago
and
with
which
we
live
for
175
years
without
even
raising
the
question.
theoretically,
i
supposed
a
requirement
that
there
must
be
legislative
standards
for
jury
sentencing
and
murder
cases
would
be
equally
applicable
to
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases.
and
the
fourth
of
our
states
have
extensive
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases
doesn’t
particularly
appeal
to
me
but
it
also
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
which
the
states
ought
to
be
free
to
determine
in
their
own
way
and
it
would
apply
indeed
it
seems
to
me
the
sentencing
by
a
judge
in
capital
and
non-capital
cases
and
as
suggested
by
counsel
for
california
to
parole
boards
and
i
can’t
find
any
theoretical
reason
why
it
wouldn’t
be
equally
applicable
to
the
action
of
the
governor
or
the
president
in
extending
executive
clemency.
it
is
clear
though
that
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases
predated
the
constitution.
there
was
no
jury
sentencing
in
capital
cases
at
that
time
because
they
all
carried
the
death
penalty.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
problem
we
have
here
is
--
has
a
great
deal
of
background
behind
it
very
early
in
our
history.
there
were
efforts
to
mitigate
the
harshness
of
the
unvarying
death
penalty
for
serious
crimes.
it
was
on
1794
that
pennsylvania
adopted
the
device
of
dividing
murder
in
the
two
degrees
one
with
the
death
penalty
and
the
other
covering
murders
where
the
extreme
penalty
was
thought
unwarranted.
over
the
years,
this
solution
was
adopted
in
nearly
every
state
but
it
was
soon
found
that
the
degree
system
though
helpful
was
too
rigid
and
mechanical
and
that
indeed
is
a
part
of
the
problem
with
so-called
standards.
it
could
not
take
care
of
all
the
variations
or
new
answers
all
the
factors
that
might
be
relatively
involved.
there
were
pressures
on
the
jury
system
and
jury
sometimes
felt
forced
to
reach
verdicts
of
acquittal
though
guilt
had
been
proved
because
they
felt
the
penalty
was
too
severe.
an
effort
to
meet
this
problem
took
the
form
of
introduction
of
jury
discretion
as
to
the
penalty.
the
first
statute
of
this
sort
was
in
tennessee
in
1838,
a
132
years
ago.
that
statute
provided
no
standards
and
no
one
of
the
statute
subsequently
enacted
has
undertaken
to
provide
standards.
such
statute
has
now
been
past
in
one
form
or
another
and
every
one
of
the
46
dates
which
have
the
death
penalty
and
in
relevant
acts
of
congress.
moreover,
these
statutes
have
been
repeatedly
before
the
courts
and
the
courts
including
this
court
had
repeatedly
sustained
them
often
with
illusions
to
the
fact
that
the
determination
of
the
penalty
lay
within
the
complete
discretion
of
the
jury.
the
contention
for
standards
in
this
field
is
i
think
essentially
diversionary.
it
is
really
a
part
of
an
attack
on
the
death
penalty
itself
that
is
surely
understandable
and
it’s
a
wholly
appropriate
matter
for
the
consideration
of
the
legislative
authority.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
that
the
contention
is
essentially
illusory.
in
one
guise
it
would
simply
call
for
the
proliferation
of
the
definitions
of
the
degrees
of
murder.
long
experience
is
already
shown
that
this
is
too
rigid,
too
mechanical
that
it
leads
indeed
to
resolves
that
are
harsher
than
the
community
as
prepared
to
accept.
if
by
standards
it
is
meant
that
these
are
factors
which
the
jury
is
to
take
into
consideration
and
reaching
its
judgment.
all
of
the
evidence
and
experiences
that
this
just
what
juries
do
not.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
property
selected
juries
today
do
not
approach
it
this
task
conscientious
then
thoroughly.
though
their
standards
may
not
be
wholly
articulated,
they
are
in
fact
the
standards
of
the
community
and
that
is
what
the
jury
is
for
and
careful
inquiries
have
shown
that
this
is
what
juries
in
fact
do.
further
specification
in
detail
would
probably
not
have
much
effect
since
juries
as
representatives
of
the
community
do
in
fact,
taken
to
account
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
that
i
included
in
the
best
know
formulations.
the
chief,
one
of
this
is
the
list
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
in
the
american
law
institutes
draft
of
a
model
penal
code
and
none
of
which
have
been
adopted
in
any
state
though
many
other
provisions
of
that
proposal
have
been
adopted.
this
is
a
little
like
the
problem
of
defining
insanity
and
instructions
to
the
jury.
this
is
a
great
question
on
which
much
psychiatric,
academic
and
judicial
time
and
energy
had
been
spent
but
has
never
seem
to
me
that
the
exact
definition
made
much
difference
and
no
matter
what
the
formulation
is,
the
jury
knows
that
its
task
is
to
determine
whether
this
particular
defendant
under
the
circumstances
appearing
in
this
case
should
be
held
to
be
responsible
for
what
he
has
done
in
the
light
of
general
standards
of
the
community.
moreover,
the
specification
of
these
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
would
and
all
likelihood
lead
to
harsher
verdicts
rather
than
more
lenient
ones,
in
so
far
as
the
specification
of
standards
had
any
effect
at
all.
murder
and
first-degree
murder
is
all
we
are
talking
about
is
inevitably
a
grisly
business
and
any
murder
there
will
be
circumstances
within
the
aggravation
list
as
the
counsel
for
california
has
pointed
out
that
was
true
and
every
one
of
a
128
murder
cases
in
that
state
in
the
past
five
years.
if
and
every
murder
trial,
these
aggravating
circumstances
are
put
before
the
jury
as
one
of
the
matters
which
as
a
matter
of
law
they
are
to
take
into
consideration.
the
conscientious
jury,
recognizing
the
presence
of
this
aggravation
in
this
case
will
find
it
more
difficult
to
reach
a
lenient
verdict.
we
will
have,
i
suspect,
in
many
cases
a
request
on
behalf
of
defendants
to
omit
all
charge
as
to
standards
and
to
leave
the
matter
to
the
judgment
and
discretion
of
the
jury.
opposition
to
capital
punishment
is
surely
understandable.
but
as
long
as
it
is
the
law
of
a
land,
the
mitigating
provisions
develop
in
the
law
over
many
years
first,
the
establishment
of
degrees
of
murder
and
second,
discretion
in
the
jury
as
the
people
surrogate
to
fix
the
penalty
of
life
imprisonment
rather
than
at
death
should
not
be
found
to
violate
the
due
process
clause.
this
is
a
resolution
of
an
extraordinarily
difficult
problem
which
has
been
brought
over
many
years
with
surprising
unanimity
at
legislative
and
judicial.
our
present
solution
has
been
devise
with
great
care
and
thought
by
the
very
processes
which
may
and
all
fairness
be
called,
the
due
processes
of
law.
adoption
of
the
petitioner’s
contentions
here
is
unwarranted
both
practically
and
theoretically
and
would
in
fact
be
illusory.
the
ultimate
solution
of
this
problem
is
a
matter
for
the
judgment
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
their
legislatures.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
too
involved
the
issue
of
standards
which
was
the
only
issue
in
the
mcgautha
case
--
the
mcgautha
case.
i
have
only
a
little
more
to
say
about
that.
no
one
has
been
able
to
put
before
the
court
just
what
the
standards
are
or
should
be.
they
have
never
been
formulated
the
closest
that
has
come
to
that
is
a
very
serious
effort
made
by
professor
wexler
as
reporter
for
the
american
law
institute
for
the
model
penal
code
in
which
they
were
included
some
eight
or
ten
aggravating
factors
and
mitigating
factors.
much
the
same
factors
are
included
in
the
recently
publish
preliminary
or
study
draft
of
a
new
federal
criminal
code
by
the
national
commission
on
reform
of
federal
criminal
laws
but
it’s
not
surprising
that
they
are
very
similar
to
those
the
model
penal
code
because
professor
schwartz
who
was
the
director
of
that
study
was
the
associate
reporter
for
the
american
law
institute
study
of
the
modern
penal
code.
in
the
massive
investigation
into
the
actual
experience
in
california
which
is
published
a
year
ago
in
the
stanford
law
review,
there
were
some
175
factors
which
they
work
out
and
undertook
to
tabulate
to
see
what
the
actual
experience
had
been
and
i
would
hazard
a
guess
that
putting
a
175
factors
before
a
jury
and
in
particular
without
any
clear
instruction
is
to
how
they
should
be
weighed
and
i
don’t
know
how
such
instructions
could
be
given
would
not
be
a
productive
assignment.
there’s
one
more
factor
with
respect
to
standards
that
i
think
might
be
worth
mentioning.
the
statutory
pattern
in
these
two
cases
vary
somewhat.
in
california,
the
jury
is
given
discretion
to
determine
the
penalty.
in
ohio,
the
statute
provides
that
the
penalty
for
first-degree
murder
is
death
but
that
if
the
jury
recommends
mercy
and
then
it
shall
be
life
imprisonment.
there’s
some
suggestion
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
this
is
a
very
vital
distinction.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
any
distinction.
i
think
that
it
is
considering
the
solemnity
and
the
obvious
significance
of
the
task
with
which
the
jury
is
confronted
and
all
experience
shows
the
juries
are
particularly
properly
selected.
juries
are
extremely
conscientious
on
this
test
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
either
in
result
or
in
law
as
to
which
formulation
is
used.
now,
i
will
turn
to
the
split
trial
or
bifurcated
trial
issue
which
is
presented
only
in
the
crampton
case
and
first,
i
would
like
to
ask
to
enter
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
black,
he
asked
when
the
question
of
the
necessity
for
a
bifurcated
trial
was
first
raised
and
we
believed
that
it
wasn’t
in
the
new
jersey
case
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
29
of
state
against
johnson.
and
that
was
in
1961
and
appeal
was
taken
from
that
decision
to
this
court
and
it
was
dismissed
for
one
of
a
substantial
federal
question
in
1961.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
so
mr.
justice.
i
was
referring
to
being
judicially
raised
and
particularly
before
this
court.
it
was
raised
in
that
case
before
this
court
in
1961.
i
know
of
no
previous
allusion
to
it
either
in
court
or
before
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
earliest
legislative
act
was
1957
in
california
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
serious
presentation
of
the
matter
either
in
academic
journals,
law
review
articles
or
before
legislatures
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
six
states
now
have
it
including
one
or
two
which
have
adopted
it
within
recent
years
that
would
last
two
to
three
years.
new
york,
california
and
texas
are
large
and
important
states
which
now
have
the
procedure.
with
respect
to
the
bifurcated
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold

page

mr.
justice,
the
state
against
johnson.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i’m
unable
to
answer
that.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not,
i
do
not
believe
it
was
ever
contended
that
it
was
constitutionally
required.
it
has
been
contended
that
this
was
wise,
safe
penology
and
good
way
for
state
to
set
up
its
criminal
law.
i
have
never
seen
a
serious
contention
except
in
these
cases
that
it
is
constitutionally
required.
incidentally,
state
against
johnson
also
involved
the
standards
issue
and
there
again
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
raise
a
substantial
federal
question.
with
respect
to
the
bifurcated
trial,
we
have
again
a
question
that
seems
to
me
essentially
is
separation
of
powers
even
assuming
that
the
bifurcated
trial
is
a
good
thing
or
is
a
desirable
innovation.
is
this
a
determination
which
should
be
made
by
the
people
through
their
representatives
in
the
legislatures
or
in
congress
or
is
this
something
that
this
court
should
now
as
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
find
to
be
required
by
the
very
general
language
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
this
court
has
already
in
various
ways
indicated
that
bifurcated
trials
are
not
constitutionally
required.
the
clearest
example
is
spencer
against
texas
to
which
in
reference
has
already
been
made
and
which
is
discuss
at
pages
84
and
87
of
our
brief
decided
just
three
years
ago
and
with
a
clear
statement
there
that
there
is
no
basis
for
finding
it
required
by
the
constitution
whatever
its
merits
may
otherwise
be.
the
constitutional
intention
--
constitutional
contention
made
there
was
surely
more
serious
than
that
advanced
here.
that
case
strikes
me
as
a
tougher
case
than
this
one
do
decide
but
the
court
did
not
accept
it
making
it
plain
that
the
details
or
procedure
in
criminal
cases
are
to
a
very
great
extent
matters
to
be
decided
by
the
legislature
of
the
several
states.
it
may
be
noted
too
that
this
court
has
never
required
a
two-stage
trial
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
over
the
trial
of
federal
criminal
cases
though
such
trials
have
been
required
or
at
least
authorized
in
certain
circumstances
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
as
i’ve
been
indicated,
bifurcated
trials
have
been
adopted
in
this
country
now
by
six
states.
the
first
being
california
in
57
are
experienced
so
far
as
relatively
limited
and
the
procedure
is
surely
in
the
experimental
stage
hardly
a
situation
for
constitutional
mandate.
incidentally,
california
has
trifurcated
trials
by
the
express
provision
of
its
statute.
if
there
is
an
issue
us
to
sanity,
you
have
guilt
sanity
and
penalty
as
separate
trials.
it
has
been
suggested
that
some
other
issues
like
alibi
and
self-defense
are
just
logically
susceptible
to
this
treatment
and
you
could
have
great
multiplication
on
trials
at
least
theoretically.
now,
it’s
argued
that
split
trials
must
be
provided
in
order
to
avoid
a
violation
of
the
defendant’s
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
this
contention
will
not
with
stand
analysis
as
several
decisions
of
this
court
show.
the
guilty
plea
cases
of
last
spring
a
very
close
to
this.
but
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
does
not
mean
that
only
matters
adverse
to
the
defendant
are
barred
while
he
remains
free
to
show
those
things
which
are
favorable
to
him
through
his
own
testimony.
on
the
contrary,
the
privilege
means
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
called
as
a
witness
at
his
own
criminal
trial.
on
the
other
hand,
he
is
always
free
to
be
a
witness
if
he
chooses
but
if
he
is
a
witness
he
is
a
witness
for
all
purposes
including
cross-examination.
the
effort
of
the
trial
is
to
get
at
the
truth
including
facts
which
are
adverse
to
the
defendant
as
well
as
those
which
are
favorable
to
him.
for
basic
policy
reasons,
the
constitution
limits
the
effort
to
develop
the
truth
by
providing
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
compelled
to
testify.
that
is
his
privilege.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
whether
to
exercise
it,
guided
by
the
assistance
of
his
counsel.
it
is
often
a
hard
choice
for
the
defendant
would
like
to
show
favorable
matters
without
getting
himself
involved
in
the
unfavorable.
but
the
pressure
comes
from
the
facts
which
have
been
adduced
that
the
trials
through
witnesses
other
than
the
defendant.
he
is
not
deprived
of
his
privilege
merely
because
he
would
like
to
testify
to
favorable
matters.
this
is
well-illustrated
by
the
record
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
defendant
here
did
exercise
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
did
not
testify.
it
cannot
be
said
here
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
privilege.
moreover,
as
a
matter
of
the
record
he
did
not
ask
for
a
bifurcated
trial.
it
is
true
that
the
law
of
ohio
does
not
provide
for
such
a
division
of
the
trial
but
the
fact
remains
that
he
did
not
seek
it
and
there
may
well
have
been
reasons
for
that
decision
as
i
shall
explain
in
the
moment.
moreover,
he
did
have
an
opportunity
to
show
favorable
matters,
true
witnesses
other
than
himself.
the
defendant’s
mother
testified
and
he
introduced
substantial
medical
evidence
on
the
insanity
issue,
thus,
putting
before
the
jury
much
material
bearing
on
the
defendant
himself
and
his
backgrounds
a
favorable
to
his
interests.
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
testify
himself
but
that
surely
does
not
mean
its
exact
opposite
that
he
was
denied
his
privilege
against
self-discrimination.
and
indeed,
this
highlights
the
basic
difficulty
with
the
bifurcated
trial
as
it
has
been
developed
in
the
six
american
states
which
now
use
it.
in
the
penalty
trial,
the
state
can
and
does
show
things
adverse
to
the
defendant
which
would
not
be
admissible
in
the
unitary
trial
and
i
think
the
mcgautha
case
itself
is
a
very
clearly
example
of
that.
if
there
had
not
been
a
separate
trial,
much
that
was
harmful
to
mcgautha
and
much
that
serve
to
distinguish
him
from
his
co-defendant,
i
would
not
have
before
the
jury
because
there
was
a
separate
penalty
trial,
the
state
showed
the
prior
convictions,
the
two
co-defendants
testified
each
one
trying
to
charge
the
other
with
having
a
fire
to
shot
and
the
jury
drew
its
conclusions
from
that.
notable
among
the
things
which
can
be
shown
are
the
prior
criminal
convictions
and
other
evidence
reflecting
adversely
on
the
defendant’s
character.
thoughtful
students
have
concluded
that
a
death
penalty
is
more
likely
in
a
bifurcated
trial
than
it
is
a
unitary
one.
indeed,
we
might
well
have
arguments
before
this
court
that
the
bifurcated
trial
deprives
the
defendant
of
due
process
of
law
though
such
an
argument
would
presumably
be
in
effective
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
such
cases
spencer
against
texas
and
the
two
williams
cases.
it
would
be
improvident
we
believe
to
freeze
this
ambivalent
procedure
with
its
merits
and
demerits
still
elusive
into
a
constitutional
directive.
with
a
clear
indication
that
separate
penalty
trials
may
have
an
adverse
effect
on
defendants
who
are
exposed
to
them,
there
is
a
need
for
prudent
restraint
in
deciding
that
the
constitution
requires
their
adoption
as
an
integral
feature
of
due
process.
certainly,
our
experience
with
bifurcated
capital
trials
over
the
past
13
years
is
empty
of
any
genuine
or
compelling
indication
that
such
procedures
are
more
fair
to
an
accuse
than
the
traditional
unitary
trial.
in
this
situation,
a
procedure
never
thought
of
when
the
due
process
clause
became
part
of
our
constitution
in
1790
and
again
in
1868,
you’ll
remember
in
1790
the
trial
had
to
be
began
and
completed
between
sunup
and
sundown
and
never
seriously
advance
in
the
first
175
years
of
our
constitutional
history
should
not
now
be
read
into
the
due
process
clause
where
it
surely
cannot
be
found
by
any
accepted
process
of
construction.
if
that
were
to
be
done
perhaps
it
could
be
said
that
it
would
be
hard
to
articulate
the
standard
which
lead
to
the
conclusion.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
invitation
of
the
court
and
with
the
assistance
of
mr.
lacovara,
we
have
tried
to
be
as
much
help
to
the
court
as
possible
in
this
difficult
matter.
before
i
begin
my
argument
i
would
like
to
make
two
emendations
in
the
brief
we
have
filed
and
the
first
is
in
the
tabulation
on
page
130
showing
the
chronological
development
of
the
introduction
of
jury
discretion
into
all
of
the
statutes
of
all
the
states
near
the
bottom
of
page
130.
there’s
a
reference
to
the
new
york
statute
at
which
they’re
dated
1937.
actually,
the
new
york
statute
of
1937
applied
only
to
felony
murders.
it
was
not
until
1963
that
new
york
extended
jury
discretion
to
all
murders
and
then
on
page
138
where
we
list
the
federal
statutes
authorizing
jury
discretion
they
first
to
the
federal
statute
there
cited
18
u.s.c.
837
(b).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
page
138.
the
first
to
the
federal
statute
18
u.s.c.
837
(b)
is
now
been
repealed
since
our
brief
was
filed
and
they
say
this
was
not
a
lack
of
foresight
on
our
part.
it
was
repealed
by
the
organize
crime
control
act
of
1970
signed
by
the
president
on
october
15
and
by
the
same
act
section
844
of
title
18
was
added
and
that
statute
gives
the
jury
or
the
judge
a
power
to
fix
the
death
penalty
thus
admitting
the
problem
disclosed
by
the
jackson
case.
because
of
the
importance
of
these
cases
this
case
in
the
following
one
it’s
especially
important
to
bear
in
mind
what
is
not
involved
here.
these
cases
do
not
directly
involve
the
general
question
of
the
validity
of
the
death
penalty
although
they
are
of
course
an
indirect
attack
on
that.
in
order
to
involve
any
question
of
the
application
of
the
death
penalty
in
cases
of
rape
at
which
was
involved
in
maxwell
against
bishop.
in
both
cases,
the
convictions
before
the
court
were
for
the
crime
of
murders.
and
finally,
there
is
no
suggestion
on
the
record
and
no
contention
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
that
there
has
been
discrimination
here
on
the
basis
of
race
either
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
in
the
evidence
presented
or
in
the
ruling
as
to
charge
of
the
trial
court.
in
this
case,
the
mcgautha
case
the
only
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
the
legislatures
of
the
states
and
congress
to
spell
out
what
are
called
standards
so
they’re
never
disclose
which
must
be
put
before
the
jury
as
a
part
of
the
process
by
which
they
determine
whether
the
penalty
for
the
particular
murder
shall
be
death
or
life
imprisonment.
that
question
too
is
involved
on
the
crampton
case
and
my
argument
here
will
be
applicable
to
that
case
too.
the
crampton
case
also
involves
the
additional
question
as
to
whether
the
constitution
then
requires
a
split
or
bifurcated
trials
separating
the
question
of
guilt
from
the
question
of
penalty
that
is
not
involved
here
as
california
does
provide
a
split
trial
and
i
will
discuss
that
in
the
time
allocated
to
me
for
argument
in
the
crampton
case.
both
of
these
questions
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
california
has
had
the
bifurcated
trial
since
1957
and
jury
discretion
came
into
california
in
1874
which
was
83
years
before.
california
was
one
of
the
relative
early
states
to
adopt
jury
discretion.
both
of
the
questions
in
these
two
cases
it
seems
to
me
fall
within
the
realm
of
federal
state
relationships
how
far
are
these
matters
which
fall
within
those
areas
which
ought
to
be
for
determination
by
the
several
states
or
are
they
matters
where
the
states
have
yielded
up
their
power
by
joining
the
federal
compact.
and
in
another
sense,
the
cases
may
be
thought
of
as
presenting
a
problem
of
separation
of
powers.
how
far
these
matters
for
determination
by
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
are
both
state
or
federal?
or
how
far
are
they
matters
for
determination
by
the
judiciary.
in
either
aspect,
the
questions
are
of
course
appropriate
for
decision
by
this
court
as
the
ultimate
arbiter
on
federal
constitutional
questions
for
the
nations.
with
respect
to
standards,
there
are
certain
things
that
are
clear.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
nothing
specific
in
the
constitution
relating
to
this
matter.
we
have
only
the
general
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
adopted
in
1790
that
congress
shall
not
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
a
provision
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1868.
perhaps,
it
may
be
said
that
the
concept
to
due
process
of
law
does
not
provide
standards
for
the
guidance
of
the
courts
on
this
question
and
is
not
nourish
for
that.
however,
it
is
clearly
a
very
general
concept
and
it
would
be
at
least
surprising
if
it
was
found
to
have
a
meaning
today
which
no
one
had
ever
conceive
it
had
a
doing
the
first
175
years
or
so
of
its
existence.
of
course,
i’m
familiar
with
holmes
statement
that
it’s
revolving
to
have
no
better
reason
for
a
rule
of
law
than
so
it
was
in
the
time
of
henry
ii.
but
it
is
also
equally
true
i
think
that
it
is
at
least
surprising
to
find
things
in
the
constitution
today
which
no
one
dreamed
were
there
as
recently
as
five
years
ago
and
with
which
we
live
for
175
years
without
even
raising
the
question.
theoretically,
i
supposed
a
requirement
that
there
must
be
legislative
standards
for
jury
sentencing
and
murder
cases
would
be
equally
applicable
to
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases.
and
the
fourth
of
our
states
have
extensive
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases
doesn’t
particularly
appeal
to
me
but
it
also
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
which
the
states
ought
to
be
free
to
determine
in
their
own
way
and
it
would
apply
indeed
it
seems
to
me
the
sentencing
by
a
judge
in
capital
and
non-capital
cases
and
as
suggested
by
counsel
for
california
to
parole
boards
and
i
can’t
find
any
theoretical
reason
why
it
wouldn’t
be
equally
applicable
to
the
action
of
the
governor
or
the
president
in
extending
executive
clemency.
it
is
clear
though
that
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases
predated
the
constitution.
there
was
no
jury
sentencing
in
capital
cases
at
that
time
because
they
all
carried
the
death
penalty.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
problem
we
have
here
is
--
has
a
great
deal
of
background
behind
it
very
early
in
our
history.
there
were
efforts
to
mitigate
the
harshness
of
the
unvarying
death
penalty
for
serious
crimes.
it
was
on
1794
that
pennsylvania
adopted
the
device
of
dividing
murder
in
the
two
degrees
one
with
the
death
penalty
and
the
other
covering
murders
where
the
extreme
penalty
was
thought
unwarranted.
over
the
years,
this
solution
was
adopted
in
nearly
every
state
but
it
was
soon
found
that
the
degree
system
though
helpful
was
too
rigid
and
mechanical
and
that
indeed
is
a
part
of
the
problem
with
so-called
standards.
it
could
not
take
care
of
all
the
variations
or
new
answers
all
the
factors
that
might
be
relatively
involved.
there
were
pressures
on
the
jury
system
and
jury
sometimes
felt
forced
to
reach
verdicts
of
acquittal
though
guilt
had
been
proved
because
they
felt
the
penalty
was
too
severe.
an
effort
to
meet
this
problem
took
the
form
of
introduction
of
jury
discretion
as
to
the
penalty.
the
first
statute
of
this
sort
was
in
tennessee
in
1838,
a
132
years
ago.
that
statute
provided
no
standards
and
no
one
of
the
statute
subsequently
enacted
has
undertaken
to
provide
standards.
such
statute
has
now
been
past
in
one
form
or
another
and
every
one
of
the
46
dates
which
have
the
death
penalty
and
in
relevant
acts
of
congress.
moreover,
these
statutes
have
been
repeatedly
before
the
courts
and
the
courts
including
this
court
had
repeatedly
sustained
them
often
with
illusions
to
the
fact
that
the
determination
of
the
penalty
lay
within
the
complete
discretion
of
the
jury.
the
contention
for
standards
in
this
field
is
i
think
essentially
diversionary.
it
is
really
a
part
of
an
attack
on
the
death
penalty
itself
that
is
surely
understandable
and
it’s
a
wholly
appropriate
matter
for
the
consideration
of
the
legislative
authority.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
that
the
contention
is
essentially
illusory.
in
one
guise
it
would
simply
call
for
the
proliferation
of
the
definitions
of
the
degrees
of
murder.
long
experience
is
already
shown
that
this
is
too
rigid,
too
mechanical
that
it
leads
indeed
to
resolves
that
are
harsher
than
the
community
as
prepared
to
accept.
if
by
standards
it
is
meant
that
these
are
factors
which
the
jury
is
to
take
into
consideration
and
reaching
its
judgment.
all
of
the
evidence
and
experiences
that
this
just
what
juries
do
not.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
property
selected
juries
today
do
not
approach
it
this
task
conscientious
then
thoroughly.
though
their
standards
may
not
be
wholly
articulated,
they
are
in
fact
the
standards
of
the
community
and
that
is
what
the
jury
is
for
and
careful
inquiries
have
shown
that
this
is
what
juries
in
fact
do.
further
specification
in
detail
would
probably
not
have
much
effect
since
juries
as
representatives
of
the
community
do
in
fact,
taken
to
account
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
that
i
included
in
the
best
know
formulations.
the
chief,
one
of
this
is
the
list
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
in
the
american
law
institutes
draft
of
a
model
penal
code
and
none
of
which
have
been
adopted
in
any
state
though
many
other
provisions
of
that
proposal
have
been
adopted.
this
is
a
little
like
the
problem
of
defining
insanity
and
instructions
to
the
jury.
this
is
a
great
question
on
which
much
psychiatric,
academic
and
judicial
time
and
energy
had
been
spent
but
has
never
seem
to
me
that
the
exact
definition
made
much
difference
and
no
matter
what
the
formulation
is,
the
jury
knows
that
its
task
is
to
determine
whether
this
particular
defendant
under
the
circumstances
appearing
in
this
case
should
be
held
to
be
responsible
for
what
he
has
done
in
the
light
of
general
standards
of
the
community.
moreover,
the
specification
of
these
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
would
and
all
likelihood
lead
to
harsher
verdicts
rather
than
more
lenient
ones,
in
so
far
as
the
specification
of
standards
had
any
effect
at
all.
murder
and
first-degree
murder
is
all
we
are
talking
about
is
inevitably
a
grisly
business
and
any
murder
there
will
be
circumstances
within
the
aggravation
list
as
the
counsel
for
california
has
pointed
out
that
was
true
and
every
one
of
a
128
murder
cases
in
that
state
in
the
past
five
years.
if
and
every
murder
trial,
these
aggravating
circumstances
are
put
before
the
jury
as
one
of
the
matters
which
as
a
matter
of
law
they
are
to
take
into
consideration.
the
conscientious
jury,
recognizing
the
presence
of
this
aggravation
in
this
case
will
find
it
more
difficult
to
reach
a
lenient
verdict.
we
will
have,
i
suspect,
in
many
cases
a
request
on
behalf
of
defendants
to
omit
all
charge
as
to
standards
and
to
leave
the
matter
to
the
judgment
and
discretion
of
the
jury.
opposition
to
capital
punishment
is
surely
understandable.
but
as
long
as
it
is
the
law
of
a
land,
the
mitigating
provisions
develop
in
the
law
over
many
years
first,
the
establishment
of
degrees
of
murder
and
second,
discretion
in
the
jury
as
the
people
surrogate
to
fix
the
penalty
of
life
imprisonment
rather
than
at
death
should
not
be
found
to
violate
the
due
process
clause.
this
is
a
resolution
of
an
extraordinarily
difficult
problem
which
has
been
brought
over
many
years
with
surprising
unanimity
at
legislative
and
judicial.
our
present
solution
has
been
devise
with
great
care
and
thought
by
the
very
processes
which
may
and
all
fairness
be
called,
the
due
processes
of
law.
adoption
of
the
petitioner’s
contentions
here
is
unwarranted
both
practically
and
theoretically
and
would
in
fact
be
illusory.
the
ultimate
solution
of
this
problem
is
a
matter
for
the
judgment
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
in
their
legislatures.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
too
involved
the
issue
of
standards
which
was
the
only
issue
in
the
mcgautha
case
--
the
mcgautha
case.
i
have
only
a
little
more
to
say
about
that.
no
one
has
been
able
to
put
before
the
court
just
what
the
standards
are
or
should
be.
they
have
never
been
formulated
the
closest
that
has
come
to
that
is
a
very
serious
effort
made
by
professor
wexler
as
reporter
for
the
american
law
institute
for
the
model
penal
code
in
which
they
were
included
some
eight
or
ten
aggravating
factors
and
mitigating
factors.
much
the
same
factors
are
included
in
the
recently
publish
preliminary
or
study
draft
of
a
new
federal
criminal
code
by
the
national
commission
on
reform
of
federal
criminal
laws
but
it’s
not
surprising
that
they
are
very
similar
to
those
the
model
penal
code
because
professor
schwartz
who
was
the
director
of
that
study
was
the
associate
reporter
for
the
american
law
institute
study
of
the
modern
penal
code.
in
the
massive
investigation
into
the
actual
experience
in
california
which
is
published
a
year
ago
in
the
stanford
law
review,
there
were
some
175
factors
which
they
work
out
and
undertook
to
tabulate
to
see
what
the
actual
experience
had
been
and
i
would
hazard
a
guess
that
putting
a
175
factors
before
a
jury
and
in
particular
without
any
clear
instruction
is
to
how
they
should
be
weighed
and
i
don’t
know
how
such
instructions
could
be
given
would
not
be
a
productive
assignment.
there’s
one
more
factor
with
respect
to
standards
that
i
think
might
be
worth
mentioning.
the
statutory
pattern
in
these
two
cases
vary
somewhat.
in
california,
the
jury
is
given
discretion
to
determine
the
penalty.
in
ohio,
the
statute
provides
that
the
penalty
for
first-degree
murder
is
death
but
that
if
the
jury
recommends
mercy
and
then
it
shall
be
life
imprisonment.
there’s
some
suggestion
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
this
is
a
very
vital
distinction.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
any
distinction.
i
think
that
it
is
considering
the
solemnity
and
the
obvious
significance
of
the
task
with
which
the
jury
is
confronted
and
all
experience
shows
the
juries
are
particularly
properly
selected.
juries
are
extremely
conscientious
on
this
test
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
either
in
result
or
in
law
as
to
which
formulation
is
used.
now,
i
will
turn
to
the
split
trial
or
bifurcated
trial
issue
which
is
presented
only
in
the
crampton
case
and
first,
i
would
like
to
ask
to
enter
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
black,
he
asked
when
the
question
of
the
necessity
for
a
bifurcated
trial
was
first
raised
and
we
believed
that
it
wasn’t
in
the
new
jersey
case
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
29
of
state
against
johnson.
and
that
was
in
1961
and
appeal
was
taken
from
that
decision
to
this
court
and
it
was
dismissed
for
one
of
a
substantial
federal
question
in
1961.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
so
mr.
justice.
i
was
referring
to
being
judicially
raised
and
particularly
before
this
court.
it
was
raised
in
that
case
before
this
court
in
1961.
i
know
of
no
previous
allusion
to
it
either
in
court
or
before
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
earliest
legislative
act
was
1957
in
california
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
serious
presentation
of
the
matter
either
in
academic
journals,
law
review
articles
or
before
legislatures
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
six
states
now
have
it
including
one
or
two
which
have
adopted
it
within
recent
years
that
would
last
two
to
three
years.
new
york,
california
and
texas
are
large
and
important
states
which
now
have
the
procedure.
with
respect
to
the
bifurcated
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
on
page
29
mr.
justice,
the
state
against
johnson.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i’m
unable
to
answer
that.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not,
i
do
not
believe
it
was
ever
contended
that
it
was
constitutionally
required.
it
has
been
contended
that
this
was
wise,
safe
penology
and
good
way
for
state
to
set
up
its
criminal
law.
i
have
never
seen
a
serious
contention
except
in
these
cases
that
it
is
constitutionally
required.
incidentally,
state
against
johnson
also
involved
the
standards
issue
and
there
again
the
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
raise
a
substantial
federal
question.
with
respect
to
the
bifurcated
trial,
we
have
again
a
question
that
seems
to
me
essentially
is
separation
of
powers
even
assuming
that
the
bifurcated
trial
is
a
good
thing
or
is
a
desirable
innovation.
is
this
a
determination
which
should
be
made
by
the
people
through
their
representatives
in
the
legislatures
or
in
congress
or
is
this
something
that
this
court
should
now
as
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
find
to
be
required
by
the
very
general
language
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
this
court
has
already
in
various
ways
indicated
that
bifurcated
trials
are
not
constitutionally
required.
the
clearest
example
is
spencer
against
texas
to
which
in
reference
has
already
been
made
and
which
is
discuss
at
pages
84
and
87
of
our
brief
decided
just
three
years
ago
and
with
a
clear
statement
there
that
there
is
no
basis
for
finding
it
required
by
the
constitution
whatever
its
merits
may
otherwise
be.
the
constitutional
intention
--
constitutional
contention
made
there
was
surely
more
serious
than
that
advanced
here.
that
case
strikes
me
as
a
tougher
case
than
this
one
do
decide
but
the
court
did
not
accept
it
making
it
plain
that
the
details
or
procedure
in
criminal
cases
are
to
a
very
great
extent
matters
to
be
decided
by
the
legislature
of
the
several
states.
it
may
be
noted
too
that
this
court
has
never
required
a
two-stage
trial
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
over
the
trial
of
federal
criminal
cases
though
such
trials
have
been
required
or
at
least
authorized
in
certain
circumstances
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
as
i’ve
been
indicated,
bifurcated
trials
have
been
adopted
in
this
country
now
by
six
states.
the
first
being
california
in
57
are
experienced
so
far
as
relatively
limited
and
the
procedure
is
surely
in
the
experimental
stage
hardly
a
situation
for
constitutional
mandate.
incidentally,
california
has
trifurcated
trials
by
the
express
provision
of
its
statute.
if
there
is
an
issue
us
to
sanity,
you
have
guilt
sanity
and
penalty
as
separate
trials.
it
has
been
suggested
that
some
other
issues
like
alibi
and
self-defense
are
just
logically
susceptible
to
this
treatment
and
you
could
have
great
multiplication
on
trials
at
least
theoretically.
now,
it’s
argued
that
split
trials
must
be
provided
in
order
to
avoid
a
violation
of
the
defendant’s
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
this
contention
will
not
with
stand
analysis
as
several
decisions
of
this
court
show.
the
guilty
plea
cases
of
last
spring
a
very
close
to
this.
but
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
does
not
mean
that
only
matters
adverse
to
the
defendant
are
barred
while
he
remains
free
to
show
those
things
which
are
favorable
to
him
through
his
own
testimony.
on
the
contrary,
the
privilege
means
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
called
as
a
witness
at
his
own
criminal
trial.
on
the
other
hand,
he
is
always
free
to
be
a
witness
if
he
chooses
but
if
he
is
a
witness
he
is
a
witness
for
all
purposes
including
cross-examination.
the
effort
of
the
trial
is
to
get
at
the
truth
including
facts
which
are
adverse
to
the
defendant
as
well
as
those
which
are
favorable
to
him.
for
basic
policy
reasons,
the
constitution
limits
the
effort
to
develop
the
truth
by
providing
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
compelled
to
testify.
that
is
his
privilege.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
whether
to
exercise
it,
guided
by
the
assistance
of
his
counsel.
it
is
often
a
hard
choice
for
the
defendant
would
like
to
show
favorable
matters
without
getting
himself
involved
in
the
unfavorable.
but
the
pressure
comes
from
the
facts
which
have
been
adduced
that
the
trials
through
witnesses
other
than
the
defendant.
he
is
not
deprived
of
his
privilege
merely
because
he
would
like
to
testify
to
favorable
matters.
this
is
well-illustrated
by
the
record
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
defendant
here
did
exercise
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
did
not
testify.
it
cannot
be
said
here
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
privilege.
moreover,
as
a
matter
of
the
record
he
did
not
ask
for
a
bifurcated
trial.
it
is
true
that
the
law
of
ohio
does
not
provide
for
such
a
division
of
the
trial
but
the
fact
remains
that
he
did
not
seek
it
and
there
may
well
have
been
reasons
for
that
decision
as
i
shall
explain
in
the
moment.
moreover,
he
did
have
an
opportunity
to
show
favorable
matters,
true
witnesses
other
than
himself.
the
defendant’s
mother
testified
and
he
introduced
substantial
medical
evidence
on
the
insanity
issue,
thus,
putting
before
the
jury
much
material
bearing
on
the
defendant
himself
and
his
backgrounds
a
favorable
to
his
interests.
it
is
true
that
he
did
not
testify
himself
but
that
surely
does
not
mean
its
exact
opposite
that
he
was
denied
his
privilege
against
self-discrimination.
and
indeed,
this
highlights
the
basic
difficulty
with
the
bifurcated
trial
as
it
has
been
developed
in
the
six
american
states
which
now
use
it.
in
the
penalty
trial,
the
state
can
and
does
show
things
adverse
to
the
defendant
which
would
not
be
admissible
in
the
unitary
trial
and
i
think
the
mcgautha
case
itself
is
a
very
clearly
example
of
that.
if
there
had
not
been
a
separate
trial,
much
that
was
harmful
to
mcgautha
and
much
that
serve
to
distinguish
him
from
his
co-defendant,
i
would
not
have
before
the
jury
because
there
was
a
separate
penalty
trial,
the
state
showed
the
prior
convictions,
the
two
co-defendants
testified
each
one
trying
to
charge
the
other
with
having
a
fire
to
shot
and
the
jury
drew
its
conclusions
from
that.
notable
among
the
things
which
can
be
shown
are
the
prior
criminal
convictions
and
other
evidence
reflecting
adversely
on
the
defendant’s
character.
thoughtful
students
have
concluded
that
a
death
penalty
is
more
likely
in
a
bifurcated
trial
than
it
is
a
unitary
one.
indeed,
we
might
well
have
arguments
before
this
court
that
the
bifurcated
trial
deprives
the
defendant
of
due
process
of
law
though
such
an
argument
would
presumably
be
in
effective
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
such
cases
spencer
against
texas
and
the
two
williams
cases.
it
would
be
improvident
we
believe
to
freeze
this
ambivalent
procedure
with
its
merits
and
demerits
still
elusive
into
a
constitutional
directive.
with
a
clear
indication
that
separate
penalty
trials
may
have
an
adverse
effect
on
defendants
who
are
exposed
to
them,
there
is
a
need
for
prudent
restraint
in
deciding
that
the
constitution
requires
their
adoption
as
an
integral
feature
of
due
process.
certainly,
our
experience
with
bifurcated
capital
trials
over
the
past
13
years
is
empty
of
any
genuine
or
compelling
indication
that
such
procedures
are
more
fair
to
an
accuse
than
the
traditional
unitary
trial.
in
this
situation,
a
procedure
never
thought
of
when
the
due
process
clause
became
part
of
our
constitution
in
1790
and
again
in
1868,
you’ll
remember
in
1790
the
trial
had
to
be
began
and
completed
between
sunup
and
sundown
and
never
seriously
advance
in
the
first
175
years
of
our
constitutional
history
should
not
now
be
read
into
the
due
process
clause
where
it
surely
cannot
be
found
by
any
accepted
process
of
construction.
if
that
were
to
be
done
perhaps
it
could
be
said
that
it
would
be
hard
to
articulate
the
standard
which
lead
to
the
conclusion.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
should
be
affirmed.
