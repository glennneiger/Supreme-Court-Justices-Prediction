mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
a
question
that
affects
the
tax
liability
of
every
savings
and
loan
association
that
insures
its
depositors’
accounts
with
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation,
respondent
is
such
an
association.
during
1963,
the
only
taxable
year
in
issue,
it
paid
a
regular
annual
insurance
premium
for
depositors
insurance
to
the
insurance
corporation,
amounting
to
approximately
$135,000.00.
this
payment
was
required
by
section
404
(b)
of
the
national
housing
act
and
the
commissioner
allowed
it
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
deduction
under
section
162
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
treatment
of
this
payment
is
not
in
dispute.
also
during
1963,
respondent
contributed
an
additional
$882,000.00
to
the
insurance
corporation.
this
contribution
was
required
by
section
404
(d)
of
the
national
housing
act
and
it
is
described
in
the
statute
as
being
in
the
nature
of
a
prepayment
with
respect
to
future
premiums.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
$882,000.00
is
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
of
a
1963,
on
the
ground
that
it
is
simply
an
additional
cost
of
current
insurance
as
respondent
claims
or
whether
as
the
commissioner
urges,
the
$882,000.00
is
a
capital
expenditure,
which
is
deductible
in
future
years,
if
actually
used
to
pay
respondents’
regular
annual
insurance
premiums
or
to
meet
insurance
losses
of
the
insurance
corporation.
in
other
words,
the
basic
question
here
is
not
whether
a
deduction
should
be
allowed,
but
when
a
deduction
should
be
allowed.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
justice,
let
me
deal
first
with
the
capital
expenditure
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
term
cap
--
let
me
start
with
capital
expenditure.
the
term
capital
expenditure
appears
and
is
defined
in
section
263
of
the
code.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
that
issue
has
been
dealt
with
explicitly
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
when
he
sat
on
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
case
called
general
bancshares
corporation,
which
is
not
cited
in
either
of
the
briefs,
but
was
cited
below
and
which
is
reported
at
326
f.2d.
there,
mr.
justice
blackmun
speaking
for
unanimous
eighth
circuit,
in
the
case
in
which
this
court
subsequently
denied
certiorari,
said
this
about
section
263,
and
i
quote,
“section
263,
with
its
denial
of
deductibility
for
specified
capital
expenditures,
and
section
162
(a),
with
its
grant
of
deductibility
for
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses,
are
not
of
course,
mutually
exclusive.
neither
are
they
together
all
inclusive.”
section
263
obviously
is
not
in
itself
an
exclusive
list
of
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
apart
from
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
comments
in
that
case,
this
court
only
last
term
in
two
unanimous
decisions
in
the
woodward
and
hilton
cases
held
that
appraisal
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
the
evaluation
of
dissenting
shareholders’
stock
were
nondeductible
capital
expenditures,
but
they
too
are
not
new
buildings
or
permanent
improvement
or
betterments.
and
the
court
did
this
of
course,
without
mention
of
the
fact
that
section
263
has
only
a
limited
definition.
so,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
mr.
justice
that
this
court
has
innumerable
occasions
done
that
in
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
on
innumerable
occasions,
as
early
as
1938
in
helvering
and
winmill,
it
held
that
brokerage
expenses
in
the
acquisition
of
capital
stock
are
capital
expenditures
to
be
added
to
the
cost
of
the
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
and
capital
itself
mr.
justice
is
not
described
in
section
263,
but
we
nevertheless
don’t
allow
a
deduction
for
it.
and
so,
capital
stock,
if
i
go
out
and
buy
some
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right,
for
the
purchase
of
capital
stock.
it
is
a
capital
expenditure,
which
at
least
temporarily
cannot
be
deducted.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
whether
section
263
could
also
include
a
non-depreciable
asset,
but
i
don’t
think
it
really
matters.
the
point
is
that
i
think
it's
clear
that
section
--
that
capital
expenditures
are
more
broadly
defined
then
in
section
263
that
this
court
and
so
far
as
i
know,
all
courts
have
consistently
subscribed
to
that.
we
don’t
think
it's
any
real
bar
to
our
position
here
that
the
costs
that
we’re
talking
about
here
are
not
described
in
section
263.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don’t
think
it
is
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right
mr.
justice,
and
that’s
what
the
court
did
in
the
woodward
and
hilton
cases.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
did
not
cite
section
263
in
our
brief.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
can
call
them
capital
outlays.
i
don’t
think
the
verbiage
is
important.
the
question
is
what
they
really
are
and
we
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
say
we
rely
on
the
verbiage
of
the
treasury
regulations,
section
1.461,
which
appears
on
pages
41
and
42
of
our
brief.
and
reads
in
pertinent
part
that
“if
an
expenditure
results
in
the
creation
of
an
asset
having
a
useful
life
which
extends
substantially
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year,
such
an
expenditure
may
not
be
deductible,
or
may
be
deductible
only
in
part,
for
the
taxable
year
in
which
made.”
perhaps,
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
point
out
why
it
is
that
we
capitalize
anything,
why
do
we
capitalize
buildings
now?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
sir.
it's
general
bancshares
corporation
against
the
commissioner,
326
f.2d
712,
and
the
material
that
i
quoted
was
at
716.
the
reason
why
we
require
the
capitalization
of
anything,
as
i
was
saying
in
our
judgment,
is
that
if
you
didn’t
capitalize,
you
would
be
charging
against
the
income
of
a
single
year,
cost
of
an
asset
that
was
going
to
benefit
a
number
of
future
years,
in
the
case
of
a
building,
for
example.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
as
you
recover
its
cost.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
the
point
is
that
we
require
capitalization
in
the
first
instance,
because
to
charge
the
whole
thing
off
would
distort
income.
and
i
would
suggest
that
to
this
court,
mr.
justice
that
we’d
have
precisely
the
same
rules,
if
there
were
no
section
263
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
because
section
446
of
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
that
income
be
reported
clearly
and
it
seems
to
us
that
a
clear
reflection
of
income,
in
the
case
of
a
cost
that’s
going
to
benefit
future
years
and
can
properly
be
described
as
an
asset,
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
that
i
have
quoted
is
one
that
should
not
be
deducted
currently.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
we
didn’t
refer
to
it
capital
expenditure
in
the
sense
of
the
statute,
but
in
the
sense
used
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
at
all
relevant
times,
respondent
has
been
a
member
of
federal
home
loan
bank
of
san
francisco
and
has
insured
its
depositors’
accounts
with
the
insurance
corporation.
prior
to
1962,
respondents
was
required
to
own
stock
in
itself
federal
home
loan
bank
in
an
amount
at
least
equal
to
2%
of
its
mortgage
loans
and
to
maintain
this
percentage
of
ownership.
respondent
has
always
capitalized
its
purchases
of
such
stock.
also
prior
to
1962,
it
was
required
to
pay
an
annual
insurance
premium
to
the
insurance
corporation
of
1/12
of
1%
of
all
insured
accounts
and
creditor
obligations.
this
expense
corresponding
to
the
$135,000.00
premium
for
1963
has
always
been
allowed
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
by
the
commissioner.
in
1961,
congress
changed
these
requirements,
effective
january
1,
1962.
this
change
resulted
in
the
present
litigation.
first,
congress
reduced
the
stock
ownership
requirement
in
the
federal
home
loan
bank
from
2%
to
1%
of
mortgage
loans.
second,
it
continued
the
regular
annual
premium
requirement
of
1/12
of
1%
of
savings
account
and
creditor
obligations.
and
third,
it
imposed
a
new
requirement
in
section
404
(d),
that
in
certain
years
each
insured
institution
contribute
2%
of
any
increase
in
its
savings
accounts
and
creditor
obligations,
during
the
proceeding
year
to
the
insurance
corporation.
congress
thought
that
the
additional
contributions
required
under
section
404
(d)
would
be
about
the
same
as
the
larger
stock
purchases
that
would
have
been
made
under
the
prior
act.
indeed,
if
the
savings
and
loan
association
has
to
purchase
any
stock
to
meet
the
new
lower
1%
requirement,
its
obligation
under
section
404
(d)
is
reduced
by
that
amount.
regular
insurance
premiums
received
by
the
insurance
corporation
are
part
of
its
gross
income
to
the
extent
that
the
corporation
does
not
use
them
to
meet
its
current
expenses
and
losses.
they
are
transferred
to
the
insurance
corporation’s
primary
reserve
which
the
corporation
is
directed
to
establish
in
the
national
housing
act.
that
reserve
contains
its
cumulative
net
income
and
it's
available
to
meet
losses
if
income
of
any
year
is
insufficient.
section
404
(d)
contributions
on
the
other
hand,
the
ones
that
are
here
in
dispute
are
not
considered
part
of
the
insurance
company’s
gross
income
and
are
not
added
to
its
primary
reserve.
they
are
transferred
directly
to
the
insurance
corporation’s
secondary
reserve,
which
the
insurance
corporation
also
is
directed
to
establish
in
the
national
housing
act.
unlike
the
primary
reserve,
this
secondary
reserve
is
not
freely
available
to
meet
expenses
and
losses
of
the
current
year.
it
may
be
used
only
to
meet
losses
and
only
if
all
of
the
corporation’s
other
accounts
are
first
exhausted.
once
respondent
makes
a
regular
annual
premium
payment,
that
payment
is
loss
to
it.
the
premium
obligates
the
corporation
only
to
provide
insurance
coverage
for
the
current
year.
on
the
other
hand,
the
contributions
to
the
insurance
corporation’s
secondary
reserve
create
a
beneficial
ownership
interest
in
that
reserve.
this
interest
is
evidenced
by
annual
statements
which
the
insurance
corporation
sends
to
each
insured
institution
each
year
advising
it
of
its
then
current
share
of
the
secondary
reserve.
respondent’s
share
of
the
reserve
amounted
to
nearly
$5
million,
as
of
the
end
of
1967.
this
share
consists
not
only
of
the
contributions
made
by
the
insured
institution,
but
also
includes
an
annual
return
on
investment
at
a
rate
equal
to
the
return
earned
by
the
corporation
on
its
investments.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right
mr.
justice.
the
rate
is
average
to
3
to
4.75%
percent
annually,
roughly.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
you
could
hold
off,
i'm
just
coming
to
that.
this
is
a
rather
complicated
background,
as
you
know.
and
i'm
trying
to
give
a
picture
in
a
way
i
think
can
make
it
simplest
for
the
court.
although,
an
insured
institution’s
interest
in
the
secondary
reserve
is
not
generally
transferable,
an
association
may
transfer
its
share
in
a
merger,
consolidation,
or
other
similar
transaction.
moreover,
an
association
is
entitled
to
a
cash
refund
of
its
share,
if
it
withdraws
from
the
federal
insurance
system
or
if
it
goes
into
voluntary
or
involuntary
liquidations.
i
come
now
to
consider
how
an
association
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
is
built
up
and
how
it
is
used
to
pay
regular
annual
insurance
payments.
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve,
the
ones
that
here
in
dispute,
must
be
made
until
the
primary
and
secondary
reserves
together
equal
2%
of
all
savings
accounts
and
creditor
obligations
of
all
insured
institutions.
when
that
point
is
reached,
the
obligation
to
make
secondary
reserve
contributions
is
temporarily
suspended,
while
it
remained
suspended,
an
association
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
is
used
to
pay
its
regular
annual
insurance
premium.
this
reduces
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve.
now,
if
a
particular
savings
and
loan
association
has
no
remaining
share
in
the
secondary
reserve,
while
the
obligation
to
make
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
is
generally
suspended,
it
pays
its
annual
insurance
premium
in
cash.
the
use
of
shares
in
the
secondary
reserve
to
discharge
the
regular
annual
insurance
premiums
continues
until
the
total
of
the
primary
and
secondary
reserves
falls
below
1.75%
of
all
insured
accounts
and
creditor
obligations.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
for
the
amount
that
is
taken
out
of
the
secondary
reserve
and
transferred
to
the
primary
reserve
to
pay
the
regular
annual
premium
for
that
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly,
because
they
don’t
have
to
pay
it
in
cash,
when
they
pay
it
out
of
their
share
of
the
secondary
reserve,
that’s
why
i
stressed
the
point
of
a
particular
association
doesn’t
have
any
share
in
the
secondary
reserve,
it's
going
to
they
have
to
come
up
with
the
money
in
cash,
instead
of
valued
share.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
for
the
general
obligation,
but
each
individual
company
is
stuck
with
its
own
secondary
reserve.
for
example,
if
you
had
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
has
to
come
up
with
the
money.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
are
renewed,
as
i
have
said,
when
the
total
of
the
two
reserves
falls
below
1.75%.
at
that
time
and
until
the
total
again
reaches
2%
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
must
be
made.
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
are
permanently
terminated,
when
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
the
2%
level.
regular
insurance
premiums
must
be
paid
annually
either
in
cash
or
through
use
of
an
association
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
until
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
2%
of
all
insured
accounts
and
creditor
obligations
of
all
insured
institutions.
when
it
does,
any
association
who
is
full
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
has
not
been
used
to
pay
regular
premiums
is
entitled
to
a
cash
refund
of
its
remaining
share.
thereafter,
regular
premiums
must
be
paid
whenever
the
primary
reserve
falls
below
the
2%
level.
all
that
this
court
needs
to
understand
about
this
complicated
arrangement
is
that
in
some
years,
like
1963,
an
association
will
be
making
regular
premium
payments
in
cash,
and
also,
contributing
to
the
secondary
reserve
in
cash.
in
other
years,
for
example
this
year,
it
will
make
no
cash
payments
and
its
regular
annual
premium
will
be
paid
out
of
its
share
of
the
secondary
reserve.
i
think
the
matter
can
be
further
clarified
if
we
look
at
what
has
actually
happen
since
1962,
when
this
scheme
went
into
effect.
from
1962
through
1969,
respondents
paid
regular
premiums
and
cash,
and
also
made
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve.
in
its
view,
it
is
entitled
to
two
deductions
in
each
of
those
years.
we
say
that
only
the
regular
annual
premium
is
deductible.
by
the
end
of
1969,
the
total
of
the
primary
and
the
secondary
reserves
reach
the
2%
level.
consequently,
the
obligation
to
make
payments
to
the
secondary
reserve
was
suspended
and
respondent’s
regular
annual
premium
was
paid
of
its
share
of
the
secondary
reserve
in
1970.
it
will
continue
to
be
paid
out
of
the
secondary
reserve
this
year,
and
for
the
next
several
years.
respondent’s
position
is
that
no
deduction
should
be
allowed
during
these
years.
we
say
that
a
deduction
should
be
allowed
for
the
regular
annual
premium.
in
short,
under
respondent’s
method,
deductions
for
insurance
coverage
would
be
bunched
in
the
years,
in
which
it
makes
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve.
under
our
method,
the
cost
of
the
insurance
would
be
spread
over
the
entire
period,
by
allowing
a
deduction
each
year
for
the
regular
annual
premium,
irrespective
of
whether
it
is
paid
in
cash
or
out
of
an
association
share
of
the
secondary
reserve.
the
tax
court
upheld
the
government’s
position
in
the
unanimous
reviewed
decision
that
these
payments
into
the
secondary
reserve
constituted
capital
outlays,
if
i
may
use
that
word.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
in
a
2
to
1
decision.
as
i
have
said
before,
our
position
here
is
based
on
the
treasury
regulations
that
i
have
quoted.
and
these
regulations
are
not
challenged
by
the
respondent.
they
are
not
cited
by
the
respondent
in
their
brief.
and
they
require
that
the
government
show
two
requirements.
first,
that
an
asset
has
been
created,
and
second,
if
that
asset
has
a
useful
life,
extending
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year.
now,
we
think
this
is
shown
by
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
page
41
of
our
brief
mr.
justice,
roughly
halfway
down.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
say
that
respondent
acquired
an
asset,
because
it
had
an
identifiable
interest
in
the
secondary
reserve,
evidenced
by
the
annual
statements
furnished
by
the
insurance
corporation.
it
is
something
that
respondent
owns.
it
is
transferable
in
limited
circumstance
to
another.
it
earns
interest
each
year,
based
on
the
interest
earned
by
the
insurance
corporation.
and
it
has
real
value,
which
would
be
recognized
for
example,
if
respondent’s
parent
corporation
would
sell
its
stock
in
respondent
to
another.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
buyer
would
pay
more
for
respondent’s
stock
than
it
would
for
the
stock
of
another
savings
and
loan
association
that
was
and
all
other
respects,
similarly
situated
to
respondent,
except
that
it
had
no
interest
in
the
secondary
reserve.
we
also
believe
that
it's
clear
that
respondent’s
secondary
reserve
interest
will
provide
a
future
benefit
to
respondent,
and
thus
that
it
has
a
useful
like
extending
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year.
if
respondent
remains
in
business,
that
benefit
will
anew
to
it
in
the
form
of
future
insurance
coverage.
if
it
merges
with
another
association,
its
parent
will
benefit
from
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
are
receiving
additional
shares
of
stock
in
the
surviving
corporation.
if
respondent
leaves
the
federal
insurance
system
or
goes
out
of
business,
it
will
get
a
cash
rebate
of
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve.
if
any
amount
remains
in
the
secondary
reserve,
when
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
the
2%
level,
that
amount
will
be
refunded
to
respondent
in
cash.
in
short,
respondent
will
get
a
benefit
from
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve,
in
one
form
or
another,
in
future
years.
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
further
comment
beyond
what
we’ve
said
in
our
footnote.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
and
whether
or
not
so
mr.
justice,
not
applicable
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
brief
points,
i
think
one
of
the
difficulties
in
addition
to
the
mathematical
difficulties
in
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
the
respondent
was
required
to
both
pay
the
regular
annual
premium
in
1963,
and
also
to
come
up
with
the
additional
money
that
would
go
into
the
secondary
reserve.
and
this
aspect
of
compulsion
is
one
that
goes
through
a
lot
of
tax
cases.
and
statement
from
this
court
regarding
its
significance
would
be
most
welcome.
i
should
like
to
put
a
hypothetical
to
the
court,
which
raises
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh
that’s
deductible
as
an
ordinary
expense.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
pay
the
same
year,
no
that
is
not,
that
is
a
capital
outlay.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
not
quite,
almost.
the
tax
court
has
elaborated
in
great
detail
why
it
could
not
be
considered
squarely
to
be
prepaid.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
no
cash
payment,
but
they’re
still
are
obligated
to
pay
the
regular
premium
of
1/12.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right,
they’re
suspended.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
it
used
to
pay
the
future
premium.
now,
this
question
of
compulsion,
as
i
say,
we
think
is
very
important.
and
i’d
like
to
put
a
simple
hypothetical
to
the
court
to
demonstrate
what
our
position
is.
let
us
suppose
that
there
had
been
a
lot
of
fires
in
a
particular
area.
and
a
local
ordinance
is
passed
requiring
each
business
in
that
locality
to
obtain
each
year,
from
a
local
fire
department,
a
certificate
of
fire
safety.
let's
suppose
in
order
to
obtain
that
certificate
of
fire
safety,
guards
have
to
be
posted
on
the
business
premises
each
night,
and
also
a
modern
up-to-date
sprinkler
system
has
to
be
installed
on
the
premises.
i
would
suggest
that
although
the
salaries
of
the
guards
are
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses,
that
this
court
would
hold
unanimously
that
the
cost
of
the
sprinkler
system
is
a
capital
expenditure,
this
time
within
the
meaning
of
section
263,
even
though,
and
if
i
may
quote
from
the
respondent’s
brief,
“the
purpose
of
making
both
expenditures
is
the
same,
the
compulsion
of
making
both
expenditures
is
the
same,
and
the
consequence
of
not
making
both
expenditures
is
the
same.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
precisely
and
an
expression
from
this
court
on
that
issue,
i
think
would
do
a
great
deal
to
resolve
for
a
lot
of
tax
cases
that
are
now
pending.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
seems
to
us
mr.
chief
justice
that
respondent’s
argument
here,
principal
argument
in
its
brief,
which
they
did
not
elaborate
this
afternoon
is
that
it
had
to
pay
the
section
404
(d)
payments,
under
the
national
housing
act,
it
had
to
pay
them,
that’s
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
that’s
why
they
held
adversely
to
the
government.
and
we
say
the
fact
that
you
have
to
pay
them,
doesn’t
--
isn’t
of
any
more
significance
in
the
resolution
of
this
case
than
the
fact
that
you
require
to
put
in
a
sprinkler
system.
the
question
is
whether
you
have
an
asset
within
the
meaning
of
those
regulations,
with
the
useful
life
extending
substantially
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year.
and
that
question
is
the
same,
whether
it
be
a
sprinkler
system
or
the
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
that
are
involved
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
each
year?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
the
hypothetical
you
put
is
very
similar
to
a
ruling
relating
to
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
and
which
we
think
is
not
relevant.
and
under
that
ruling,
the
banks
would
pay
a
premium
each
year,
and
we’d
get
back
any
excess
in
the
following
year.
and
the
question
was
whether
that
was
an
ordinary,
necessary
business
expense
and
the
internal
revenue
service
rule
that
it
was.
the
reason
that
it
ruled
that
it
was,
was
this,
the
only
reason
the
money
wasn’t
paid
back
at
the
end
of
the
same
year
was
if
the
fdic
couldn’t
go
and
make
all
the
computations
to
figure
out
how
much
was
going
to
be
needed
to
cover
the
expenses
and
losses
of
that
year.
you
didn’t
have
an
asset
with
the
useful
life
extending
substantially
beyond
the
close
of
the
year.
the
refund
was
made
within
a
few
months
of
the
succeeding
year.
as
i
said,
we
rely
on
this
regulation,
which
we
think
squarely
fits
this
case.
i
see
that
i’m
out
of
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
a
question
that
affects
the
tax
liability
of
every
savings
and
loan
association
that
insures
its
depositors’
accounts
with
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation,
respondent
is
such
an
association.
during
1963,
the
only
taxable
year
in
issue,
it
paid
a
regular
annual
insurance
premium
for
depositors
insurance
to
the
insurance
corporation,
amounting
to
approximately
$135,000.00.
this
payment
was
required
by
section
404
(b)
of
the
national
housing
act
and
the
commissioner
allowed
it
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
deduction
under
section
162
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
treatment
of
this
payment
is
not
in
dispute.
also
during
1963,
respondent
contributed
an
additional
$882,000.00
to
the
insurance
corporation.
this
contribution
was
required
by
section
404
(d)
of
the
national
housing
act
and
it
is
described
in
the
statute
as
being
in
the
nature
of
a
prepayment
with
respect
to
future
premiums.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
$882,000.00
is
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
of
a
1963,
on
the
ground
that
it
is
simply
an
additional
cost
of
current
insurance
as
respondent
claims
or
whether
as
the
commissioner
urges,
the
$882,000.00
is
a
capital
expenditure,
which
is
deductible
in
future
years,
if
actually
used
to
pay
respondents’
regular
annual
insurance
premiums
or
to
meet
insurance
losses
of
the
insurance
corporation.
in
other
words,
the
basic
question
here
is
not
whether
a
deduction
should
be
allowed,
but
when
a
deduction
should
be
allowed.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
justice,
let
me
deal
first
with
the
capital
expenditure
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
term
cap
--
let
me
start
with
capital
expenditure.
the
term
capital
expenditure
appears
and
is
defined
in
section
263
of
the
code.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
that
issue
has
been
dealt
with
explicitly
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
when
he
sat
on
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
case
called
general
bancshares
corporation,
which
is
not
cited
in
either
of
the
briefs,
but
was
cited
below
and
which
is
reported
at
326
f.2d.
there,
mr.
justice
blackmun
speaking
for
unanimous
eighth
circuit,
in
the
case
in
which
this
court
subsequently
denied
certiorari,
said
this
about
section
263,
and
i
quote,
“section
263,
with
its
denial
of
deductibility
for
specified
capital
expenditures,
and
section
162
(a),
with
its
grant
of
deductibility
for
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses,
are
not
of
course,
mutually
exclusive.
neither
are
they
together
all
inclusive.”
section
263
obviously
is
not
in
itself
an
exclusive
list
of
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
apart
from
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
comments
in
that
case,
this
court
only
last
term
in
two
unanimous
decisions
in
the
woodward
and
hilton
cases
held
that
appraisal
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
the
evaluation
of
dissenting
shareholders’
stock
were
nondeductible
capital
expenditures,
but
they
too
are
not
new
buildings
or
permanent
improvement
or
betterments.
and
the
court
did
this
of
course,
without
mention
of
the
fact
that
section
263
has
only
a
limited
definition.
so,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
mr.
justice
that
this
court
has
innumerable
occasions
done
that
in
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
on
innumerable
occasions,
as
early
as
1938
in
helvering
and
winmill,
it
held
that
brokerage
expenses
in
the
acquisition
of
capital
stock
are
capital
expenditures
to
be
added
to
the
cost
of
the
stock.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes
sir,
and
capital
itself
mr.
justice
is
not
described
in
section
263,
but
we
nevertheless
don’t
allow
a
deduction
for
it.
and
so,
capital
stock,
if
i
go
out
and
buy
some
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right,
for
the
purchase
of
capital
stock.
it
is
a
capital
expenditure,
which
at
least
temporarily
cannot
be
deducted.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
whether
section
263
could
also
include
a
non-depreciable
asset,
but
i
don’t
think
it
really
matters.
the
point
is
that
i
think
it's
clear
that
section
--
that
capital
expenditures
are
more
broadly
defined
then
in
section
263
that
this
court
and
so
far
as
i
know,
all
courts
have
consistently
subscribed
to
that.
we
don’t
think
it's
any
real
bar
to
our
position
here
that
the
costs
that
we’re
talking
about
here
are
not
described
in
section
263.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don’t
think
it
is
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right
mr.
justice,
and
that’s
what
the
court
did
in
the
woodward
and
hilton
cases.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
did
not
cite
section
263
in
our
brief.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
can
call
them
capital
outlays.
i
don’t
think
the
verbiage
is
important.
the
question
is
what
they
really
are
and
we
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
say
we
rely
on
the
verbiage
of
the
treasury
regulations,
section
1.461,
which
appears
on
pages
41
and
42
of
our
brief.
and
reads
in
pertinent
part
that
“if
an
expenditure
results
in
the
creation
of
an
asset
having
a
useful
life
which
extends
substantially
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year,
such
an
expenditure
may
not
be
deductible,
or
may
be
deductible
only
in
part,
for
the
taxable
year
in
which
made.”
perhaps,
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
point
out
why
it
is
that
we
capitalize
anything,
why
do
we
capitalize
buildings
now?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
sir.
it's
general
bancshares
corporation
against
the
commissioner,
326
f.2d
712,
and
the
material
that
i
quoted
was
at
716.
the
reason
why
we
require
the
capitalization
of
anything,
as
i
was
saying
in
our
judgment,
is
that
if
you
didn’t
capitalize,
you
would
be
charging
against
the
income
of
a
single
year,
cost
of
an
asset
that
was
going
to
benefit
a
number
of
future
years,
in
the
case
of
a
building,
for
example.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
as
you
recover
its
cost.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
the
point
is
that
we
require
capitalization
in
the
first
instance,
because
to
charge
the
whole
thing
off
would
distort
income.
and
i
would
suggest
that
to
this
court,
mr.
justice
that
we’d
have
precisely
the
same
rules,
if
there
were
no
section
263
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
because
section
446
of
the
internal
revenue
code
requires
that
income
be
reported
clearly
and
it
seems
to
us
that
a
clear
reflection
of
income,
in
the
case
of
a
cost
that’s
going
to
benefit
future
years
and
can
properly
be
described
as
an
asset,
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
that
i
have
quoted
is
one
that
should
not
be
deducted
currently.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
but
we
didn’t
refer
to
it
capital
expenditure
in
the
sense
of
the
statute,
but
in
the
sense
used
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
at
all
relevant
times,
respondent
has
been
a
member
of
federal
home
loan
bank
of
san
francisco
and
has
insured
its
depositors’
accounts
with
the
insurance
corporation.
prior
to
1962,
respondents
was
required
to
own
stock
in
itself
federal
home
loan
bank
in
an
amount
at
least
equal
to
2%
of
its
mortgage
loans
and
to
maintain
this
percentage
of
ownership.
respondent
has
always
capitalized
its
purchases
of
such
stock.
also
prior
to
1962,
it
was
required
to
pay
an
annual
insurance
premium
to
the
insurance
corporation
of
1/12
of
1%
of
all
insured
accounts
and
creditor
obligations.
this
expense
corresponding
to
the
$135,000.00
premium
for
1963
has
always
been
allowed
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
by
the
commissioner.
in
1961,
congress
changed
these
requirements,
effective
january
1,
1962.
this
change
resulted
in
the
present
litigation.
first,
congress
reduced
the
stock
ownership
requirement
in
the
federal
home
loan
bank
from
2%
to
1%
of
mortgage
loans.
second,
it
continued
the
regular
annual
premium
requirement
of
1/12
of
1%
of
savings
account
and
creditor
obligations.
and
third,
it
imposed
a
new
requirement
in
section
404
(d),
that
in
certain
years
each
insured
institution
contribute
2%
of
any
increase
in
its
savings
accounts
and
creditor
obligations,
during
the
proceeding
year
to
the
insurance
corporation.
congress
thought
that
the
additional
contributions
required
under
section
404
(d)
would
be
about
the
same
as
the
larger
stock
purchases
that
would
have
been
made
under
the
prior
act.
indeed,
if
the
savings
and
loan
association
has
to
purchase
any
stock
to
meet
the
new
lower
1%
requirement,
its
obligation
under
section
404
(d)
is
reduced
by
that
amount.
regular
insurance
premiums
received
by
the
insurance
corporation
are
part
of
its
gross
income
to
the
extent
that
the
corporation
does
not
use
them
to
meet
its
current
expenses
and
losses.
they
are
transferred
to
the
insurance
corporation’s
primary
reserve
which
the
corporation
is
directed
to
establish
in
the
national
housing
act.
that
reserve
contains
its
cumulative
net
income
and
it's
available
to
meet
losses
if
income
of
any
year
is
insufficient.
section
404
(d)
contributions
on
the
other
hand,
the
ones
that
are
here
in
dispute
are
not
considered
part
of
the
insurance
company’s
gross
income
and
are
not
added
to
its
primary
reserve.
they
are
transferred
directly
to
the
insurance
corporation’s
secondary
reserve,
which
the
insurance
corporation
also
is
directed
to
establish
in
the
national
housing
act.
unlike
the
primary
reserve,
this
secondary
reserve
is
not
freely
available
to
meet
expenses
and
losses
of
the
current
year.
it
may
be
used
only
to
meet
losses
and
only
if
all
of
the
corporation’s
other
accounts
are
first
exhausted.
once
respondent
makes
a
regular
annual
premium
payment,
that
payment
is
loss
to
it.
the
premium
obligates
the
corporation
only
to
provide
insurance
coverage
for
the
current
year.
on
the
other
hand,
the
contributions
to
the
insurance
corporation’s
secondary
reserve
create
a
beneficial
ownership
interest
in
that
reserve.
this
interest
is
evidenced
by
annual
statements
which
the
insurance
corporation
sends
to
each
insured
institution
each
year
advising
it
of
its
then
current
share
of
the
secondary
reserve.
respondent’s
share
of
the
reserve
amounted
to
nearly
$5
million,
as
of
the
end
of
1967.
this
share
consists
not
only
of
the
contributions
made
by
the
insured
institution,
but
also
includes
an
annual
return
on
investment
at
a
rate
equal
to
the
return
earned
by
the
corporation
on
its
investments.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right
mr.
justice.
the
rate
is
average
to
3
to
4.75%
percent
annually,
roughly.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
you
could
hold
off,
i'm
just
coming
to
that.
this
is
a
rather
complicated
background,
as
you
know.
and
i'm
trying
to
give
a
picture
in
a
way
i
think
can
make
it
simplest
for
the
court.
although,
an
insured
institution’s
interest
in
the
secondary
reserve
is
not
generally
transferable,
an
association
may
transfer
its
share
in
a
merger,
consolidation,
or
other
similar
transaction.
moreover,
an
association
is
entitled
to
a
cash
refund
of
its
share,
if
it
withdraws
from
the
federal
insurance
system
or
if
it
goes
into
voluntary
or
involuntary
liquidations.
i
come
now
to
consider
how
an
association
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
is
built
up
and
how
it
is
used
to
pay
regular
annual
insurance
payments.
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve,
the
ones
that
here
in
dispute,
must
be
made
until
the
primary
and
secondary
reserves
together
equal
2%
of
all
savings
accounts
and
creditor
obligations
of
all
insured
institutions.
when
that
point
is
reached,
the
obligation
to
make
secondary
reserve
contributions
is
temporarily
suspended,
while
it
remained
suspended,
an
association
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
is
used
to
pay
its
regular
annual
insurance
premium.
this
reduces
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve.
now,
if
a
particular
savings
and
loan
association
has
no
remaining
share
in
the
secondary
reserve,
while
the
obligation
to
make
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
is
generally
suspended,
it
pays
its
annual
insurance
premium
in
cash.
the
use
of
shares
in
the
secondary
reserve
to
discharge
the
regular
annual
insurance
premiums
continues
until
the
total
of
the
primary
and
secondary
reserves
falls
below
1.75%
of
all
insured
accounts
and
creditor
obligations.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
for
the
amount
that
is
taken
out
of
the
secondary
reserve
and
transferred
to
the
primary
reserve
to
pay
the
regular
annual
premium
for
that
year.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
exactly,
because
they
don’t
have
to
pay
it
in
cash,
when
they
pay
it
out
of
their
share
of
the
secondary
reserve,
that’s
why
i
stressed
the
point
of
a
particular
association
doesn’t
have
any
share
in
the
secondary
reserve,
it's
going
to
they
have
to
come
up
with
the
money
in
cash,
instead
of
valued
share.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
for
the
general
obligation,
but
each
individual
company
is
stuck
with
its
own
secondary
reserve.
for
example,
if
you
had
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
has
to
come
up
with
the
money.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
are
renewed,
as
i
have
said,
when
the
total
of
the
two
reserves
falls
below
1.75%.
at
that
time
and
until
the
total
again
reaches
2%
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
must
be
made.
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
are
permanently
terminated,
when
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
the
2%
level.
regular
insurance
premiums
must
be
paid
annually
either
in
cash
or
through
use
of
an
association
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
until
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
2%
of
all
insured
accounts
and
creditor
obligations
of
all
insured
institutions.
when
it
does,
any
association
who
is
full
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
has
not
been
used
to
pay
regular
premiums
is
entitled
to
a
cash
refund
of
its
remaining
share.
thereafter,
regular
premiums
must
be
paid
whenever
the
primary
reserve
falls
below
the
2%
level.
all
that
this
court
needs
to
understand
about
this
complicated
arrangement
is
that
in
some
years,
like
1963,
an
association
will
be
making
regular
premium
payments
in
cash,
and
also,
contributing
to
the
secondary
reserve
in
cash.
in
other
years,
for
example
this
year,
it
will
make
no
cash
payments
and
its
regular
annual
premium
will
be
paid
out
of
its
share
of
the
secondary
reserve.
i
think
the
matter
can
be
further
clarified
if
we
look
at
what
has
actually
happen
since
1962,
when
this
scheme
went
into
effect.
from
1962
through
1969,
respondents
paid
regular
premiums
and
cash,
and
also
made
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve.
in
its
view,
it
is
entitled
to
two
deductions
in
each
of
those
years.
we
say
that
only
the
regular
annual
premium
is
deductible.
by
the
end
of
1969,
the
total
of
the
primary
and
the
secondary
reserves
reach
the
2%
level.
consequently,
the
obligation
to
make
payments
to
the
secondary
reserve
was
suspended
and
respondent’s
regular
annual
premium
was
paid
of
its
share
of
the
secondary
reserve
in
1970.
it
will
continue
to
be
paid
out
of
the
secondary
reserve
this
year,
and
for
the
next
several
years.
respondent’s
position
is
that
no
deduction
should
be
allowed
during
these
years.
we
say
that
a
deduction
should
be
allowed
for
the
regular
annual
premium.
in
short,
under
respondent’s
method,
deductions
for
insurance
coverage
would
be
bunched
in
the
years,
in
which
it
makes
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve.
under
our
method,
the
cost
of
the
insurance
would
be
spread
over
the
entire
period,
by
allowing
a
deduction
each
year
for
the
regular
annual
premium,
irrespective
of
whether
it
is
paid
in
cash
or
out
of
an
association
share
of
the
secondary
reserve.
the
tax
court
upheld
the
government’s
position
in
the
unanimous
reviewed
decision
that
these
payments
into
the
secondary
reserve
constituted
capital
outlays,
if
i
may
use
that
word.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
in
a
2
to
1
decision.
as
i
have
said
before,
our
position
here
is
based
on
the
treasury
regulations
that
i
have
quoted.
and
these
regulations
are
not
challenged
by
the
respondent.
they
are
not
cited
by
the
respondent
in
their
brief.
and
they
require
that
the
government
show
two
requirements.
first,
that
an
asset
has
been
created,
and
second,
if
that
asset
has
a
useful
life,
extending
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year.
now,
we
think
this
is
shown
by
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
on
page
41
of
our
brief
mr.
justice,
roughly
halfway
down.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
say
that
respondent
acquired
an
asset,
because
it
had
an
identifiable
interest
in
the
secondary
reserve,
evidenced
by
the
annual
statements
furnished
by
the
insurance
corporation.
it
is
something
that
respondent
owns.
it
is
transferable
in
limited
circumstance
to
another.
it
earns
interest
each
year,
based
on
the
interest
earned
by
the
insurance
corporation.
and
it
has
real
value,
which
would
be
recognized
for
example,
if
respondent’s
parent
corporation
would
sell
its
stock
in
respondent
to
another.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
buyer
would
pay
more
for
respondent’s
stock
than
it
would
for
the
stock
of
another
savings
and
loan
association
that
was
and
all
other
respects,
similarly
situated
to
respondent,
except
that
it
had
no
interest
in
the
secondary
reserve.
we
also
believe
that
it's
clear
that
respondent’s
secondary
reserve
interest
will
provide
a
future
benefit
to
respondent,
and
thus
that
it
has
a
useful
like
extending
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year.
if
respondent
remains
in
business,
that
benefit
will
anew
to
it
in
the
form
of
future
insurance
coverage.
if
it
merges
with
another
association,
its
parent
will
benefit
from
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve
are
receiving
additional
shares
of
stock
in
the
surviving
corporation.
if
respondent
leaves
the
federal
insurance
system
or
goes
out
of
business,
it
will
get
a
cash
rebate
of
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve.
if
any
amount
remains
in
the
secondary
reserve,
when
the
primary
reserve
alone
reaches
the
2%
level,
that
amount
will
be
refunded
to
respondent
in
cash.
in
short,
respondent
will
get
a
benefit
from
its
share
in
the
secondary
reserve,
in
one
form
or
another,
in
future
years.
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no
further
comment
beyond
what
we’ve
said
in
our
footnote.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
and
whether
or
not
so
mr.
justice,
not
applicable
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
brief
points,
i
think
one
of
the
difficulties
in
addition
to
the
mathematical
difficulties
in
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
the
respondent
was
required
to
both
pay
the
regular
annual
premium
in
1963,
and
also
to
come
up
with
the
additional
money
that
would
go
into
the
secondary
reserve.
and
this
aspect
of
compulsion
is
one
that
goes
through
a
lot
of
tax
cases.
and
statement
from
this
court
regarding
its
significance
would
be
most
welcome.
i
should
like
to
put
a
hypothetical
to
the
court,
which
raises
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh
that’s
deductible
as
an
ordinary
expense.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
pay
the
same
year,
no
that
is
not,
that
is
a
capital
outlay.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
not
quite,
almost.
the
tax
court
has
elaborated
in
great
detail
why
it
could
not
be
considered
squarely
to
be
prepaid.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
no
cash
payment,
but
they’re
still
are
obligated
to
pay
the
regular
premium
of
1/12.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right,
they’re
suspended.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
it
used
to
pay
the
future
premium.
now,
this
question
of
compulsion,
as
i
say,
we
think
is
very
important.
and
i’d
like
to
put
a
simple
hypothetical
to
the
court
to
demonstrate
what
our
position
is.
let
us
suppose
that
there
had
been
a
lot
of
fires
in
a
particular
area.
and
a
local
ordinance
is
passed
requiring
each
business
in
that
locality
to
obtain
each
year,
from
a
local
fire
department,
a
certificate
of
fire
safety.
let's
suppose
in
order
to
obtain
that
certificate
of
fire
safety,
guards
have
to
be
posted
on
the
business
premises
each
night,
and
also
a
modern
up-to-date
sprinkler
system
has
to
be
installed
on
the
premises.
i
would
suggest
that
although
the
salaries
of
the
guards
are
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses,
that
this
court
would
hold
unanimously
that
the
cost
of
the
sprinkler
system
is
a
capital
expenditure,
this
time
within
the
meaning
of
section
263,
even
though,
and
if
i
may
quote
from
the
respondent’s
brief,
“the
purpose
of
making
both
expenditures
is
the
same,
the
compulsion
of
making
both
expenditures
is
the
same,
and
the
consequence
of
not
making
both
expenditures
is
the
same.”
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
precisely
and
an
expression
from
this
court
on
that
issue,
i
think
would
do
a
great
deal
to
resolve
for
a
lot
of
tax
cases
that
are
now
pending.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
seems
to
us
mr.
chief
justice
that
respondent’s
argument
here,
principal
argument
in
its
brief,
which
they
did
not
elaborate
this
afternoon
is
that
it
had
to
pay
the
section
404
(d)
payments,
under
the
national
housing
act,
it
had
to
pay
them,
that’s
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
that’s
why
they
held
adversely
to
the
government.
and
we
say
the
fact
that
you
have
to
pay
them,
doesn’t
--
isn’t
of
any
more
significance
in
the
resolution
of
this
case
than
the
fact
that
you
require
to
put
in
a
sprinkler
system.
the
question
is
whether
you
have
an
asset
within
the
meaning
of
those
regulations,
with
the
useful
life
extending
substantially
beyond
the
close
of
the
taxable
year.
and
that
question
is
the
same,
whether
it
be
a
sprinkler
system
or
the
contributions
to
the
secondary
reserve
that
are
involved
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
each
year?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right,
the
hypothetical
you
put
is
very
similar
to
a
ruling
relating
to
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
and
which
we
think
is
not
relevant.
and
under
that
ruling,
the
banks
would
pay
a
premium
each
year,
and
we’d
get
back
any
excess
in
the
following
year.
and
the
question
was
whether
that
was
an
ordinary,
necessary
business
expense
and
the
internal
revenue
service
rule
that
it
was.
the
reason
that
it
ruled
that
it
was,
was
this,
the
only
reason
the
money
wasn’t
paid
back
at
the
end
of
the
same
year
was
if
the
fdic
couldn’t
go
and
make
all
the
computations
to
figure
out
how
much
was
going
to
be
needed
to
cover
the
expenses
and
losses
of
that
year.
you
didn’t
have
an
asset
with
the
useful
life
extending
substantially
beyond
the
close
of
the
year.
the
refund
was
made
within
a
few
months
of
the
succeeding
year.
as
i
said,
we
rely
on
this
regulation,
which
we
think
squarely
fits
this
case.
i
see
that
i’m
out
of
time.
