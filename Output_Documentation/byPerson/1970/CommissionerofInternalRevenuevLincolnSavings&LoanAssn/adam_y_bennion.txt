mr.
adam
y.
bennion
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
certainly
in
agreement
with
the
government
here
that
this
question
not
to
turn
upon
what
the
payments
in
question
really
are
or
were.
it
is
a
taxpayer’s
position
that
in
essence
the
payments
were
primarily
insurance
premiums
and
constituted
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses.
to
go
back
to
1961,
when
the
legislation
in
question
was
introduced,
each
association
was
required
to
pay
an
insurance
premium
of
1/12
of
1%
of
its
savings
accounts
and
creditor’s
obligations.
i
will
not
keep
repeating
creditor’s
obligations,
but
i
refer
to
them
by
including
them
in
savings
accounts.
had
the
savings
and
loan
industry
remained
static,
those
insurance
premiums
of
1/12
of
1%
would
have
produced
a
2%
reserve
in
approximately
24
years.
but
of
course
with
tremendous
growth
of
the
savings
and
loan
association,
to
continue
to
collect
only
1/12
of
1%
did
not
keep
pace
with
the
ultimate
insurance
risk,
which
the
statute
has
imposed
upon
the
fslic.
and
therefore,
congress
when
it
introduced
the
act
in
question,
stated
in
both
of
the
committee
reports,
that
there
is
general
agreement
that
some
action
should
be
taken
to
build
up
the
corporation’s
reserves
at
a
faster
rate,
after
pointing
out
the
extent
to
which
they
had
declined.
and
therefore,
the
legislation
took
the
form
of
continuing
the
premium
of
1/12
of
1%,
but
the
additional
element
that
was
then
introduced
was
that
if
any
association
had
an
increase
in
its
insurance
--
in
its
savings
deposits;
it
would
have
to
pay
this
additional
premium
of
2%
of
the
amount
of
the
increase.
and
to
us
it
is
significant
that
this
is
right
in
line
with
the
element
of
a
premium
for
insurance,
it's
an
attempt
to
measure
the
cost
of
protection
by
the
increased
risk
that
the
insurance
is
company
is
put
to.
for
example,
in
our
particular
case,
lincoln’s
savings
accounts
at
the
beginning
of
1962
amounted
to
approximately
$90
million
and
they
increase
during
1962
to
$135
million,
with
the
result
that
the
potential
insurance
risk
of
the
fslic,
which
it
was
obliged
by
law
to
insure
was
increased
by
$44
million.
and
to
us,
the
essence
of
what
congress
required
was
that
because
of
the
additional
insurance
risk,
thus
imposed
upon
the
fslic,
thus
should
be
paid
a
2%
of
that
increase
as
a
premium.
not
a
premium
to
take
effect
10
years
later
when
there
might
be
a
bookkeeping
entry
transferring
an
amount
from
a
secondary
reserve
to
a
primary
reserve,
but
an
insurance
risk
that
it
was
assumed
immediately
in
1962
because
of
the
increased
savings
accounts
of
lincoln
savings
and
loan
association.
so
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
basically
the
nature
and
the
substance
of
what
was
paid
was
a
premium
measured
directly
to
the
increased
insurance
risk
assumed
by
the
fslic
and
therefore,
it
meets
basically
the
criteria
of
an
ordinary
expense.
on
the
other
hand,
undoubtedly
may
have
been
associations,
which
experienced
no
increase
in
their
savings
deposits,
as
such
an
association,
there
would
have
been
no
increase
insurance
risk
assumed
by
the
fslic,
there
would
have
been
no
increase
premium
paid
by
such
an
association
which
to
us
gives
further
illustration
of
the
fact
that
this
really
was
in
essence
the
payment
for
an
insurance
risk.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
true,
your
honor,
because
there
would
be
no
payment
due.
in
other
words,
if
an
association
did
not
increase
its
deposits,
it
would
pay
nothing
more
than
the
original
1/12
of
1%.
it
would
not
pay
it
as
2%
and
therefore,
having
paid
nothing
that
of
course
wouldn’t
be
entitled
to
no
deduction.
the
government
has
argued
that
by
this
approach
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
let
me
carry
on
one
more,
what
then
is
the
statutory
purpose
in
setting
out
both
404
(b)
and
404
(d)?
why
do
you
think
they’re
separated?
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
this
will
have
to
be
my
own
personal
opinion,
because
i
cannot
climb
into
the
minds
of
congress,
but
i
think
it
was
primarily
a
device
to
bring
about
fairness.
the
plan
of
the
insurance
statute
from
the
very
beginning
has
been
that
there
will
come
a
time
when
the
reserves
reach
a
certain
point,
when
all
payment
of
insurance
premiums
will
be
suspended.
under
the
original
act,
it
was
5%
then
it
was
reduced
to
2%.
so,
there
has
been
inherent
in
every
payment
of
every
premium,
the
possibility
of
a
future
benefit,
when
that
reserve
reached
that
point.
now,
i
personally
think
the
reason
they
adopted
this
complicated
formula
and
said,
“we’ll
charge
the
growing
associations
an
additional
2%,”
was
that
when
the
combined
primary
and
secondary
reserve
should
reach
2%.
and
therefore,
there
should
be
a
suspension
of
payments,
under
the
congressional
determination
that
2%
was
enough
to
cover
the
risk,
that
early
suspension
would
be
available
only
to
the
growing
associations
which
had
paid
this
additional
premium.
whereas,
if
you
had
an
association
which
had
paid
no
secondary
premiums
and
therefore,
had
no
secondary
account,
there
would
be
nothing
to
transfer
on
their
account,
and
therefore
they
would
have
to
continue
to
pay
the
1/12
of
1%
premium
until
the
primary
premium
by
itself
got
to
be
2%.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
only
reason
for
this
exceedingly
technical
and
complicated
formula
was
set
up,
just
as
a
matter
of
fairness.
and
i
think
it
is
fair,
i
think
that
the
associations
that
had
been
growing
and
have
been
building
up
this
fund
and
paying
the
insurance.
when
the
2%
is
arrived
at
which
congress
thought
was
sufficient.
that’s
fine,
let's
give
these
associations
a
little
bit
of
(inaudible),
while
the
others
who
have
not
been
contributing
will
continue
until
all
of
the
funds
are
transferred
over
to
the
primary
reserve.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
correct.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
correct.
now,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
government
has
referred
to
this
transfer
of
a
part
of
the
lincoln’s
account
from
the
secondary
reserve
to
the
primary
reserve,
as
an
event
which
should
give
rise
to
a
deduction
at
that
time
and
also,
which
prevents
a
distortion
of
income.
i’d
like
to
just
call
your
attention
to
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
true
distortion
of
income.
under
the
government’s
theory,
and
as
the
government
said,
this
transfer
started,
as
far
as
lincoln
is
concerned
in
1970.
under
the
government’s
theory,
the
original
payment
of
this
$800,000.00
although
was
completely
beyond
the
control
of
the
taxpayer
and
in
our
view,
had
gone
for
insurance,
is
set
upon
the
taxpayer’s
book
as
an
asset.
now
in
1970,
when
the
whole
industry
reserve
gets
up
to
2%
and
instead
of
having
to
pay
the
original
1/12
of
1%,
the
taxpayer
has
the
benefit
of
having
transferred,
let's
say
$500,000.00
from
the
secondary
reserve
to
the
primary
reserve,
this
has
the
effect
on
the
financial
statements
of
the
taxpayer
of
telling
the
public
that
is
now,
its
net
worth
has
now
decreased
to
$500,000.00.
and
yet,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
day
before
that
transfer
was
made
and
the
day
after
that
was
made,
we
had
exactly
the
same
transfer,
as
far
as
anybody
can
tell
from
the
outside,
it's
worth
exactly
what
it
was
and
yet,
under
the
government’s
treatment,
you
show
a
decrease
in
net
worth
of
a
half
million
dollars.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
no,
your
honor,
because
under
the
government’s
theory,
the
expense
is
allowable
in
that
year
even
though
no
payment
is
due.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
if
i
understood
your
honor’s
point,
but
it
did—
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that
is
correct.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it's
seems
to
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
no,
i
think
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
the
way
it
has
worked
out
as
accounts
of
reaching
for
us
is
that
if
that
by
deducting,
in
other
words,
by
writing-off
this
asset
out
of
the
secondary
reserve,
which
appears
as
an
asset
on
the
balance
sheet.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
yes.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
this
is
the
way
the
government
would
handle
it.
this
is
the
way
we
are
required
to
do
it
by
our
regulatory
agency.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
right.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it's
just
allowed
as
a
deduction,
but
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
well,
that’s
true
your
honor.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
i
wish
that
were
better
account,
but
as
the
way
our
accounts
have
explained
to
me
that
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
true,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
i
must
say
that
sounds
right,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
[laughter]
yes,
sir.
now,
the
government
has
placed
stress
upon
this
question
of
the
fact
that
the
secondary
return
earns
a
rate
of
return
which
the
statute
requires
the
fslic
to
credit
to
the
secondary
accounts
and
it
is
true
that
the
law
does
require
such
a
credit.
we
have
gone
through
in
our
brief
the
presentation
in
the
committee
hearings
by
one
of
the
savings
and
loan
big
people
who
was
unhappy
that
this
return
was
not
going
to
be
paid
in
cash,
but
nothing
happened
with
that.
and
from
a
standpoint
of
the
taxpayer,
it
has
seemed
to
us
that
this
so-called
“return”
is
really
an
illusory
thing.
it
is
credited
to
the
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
the
fslic
your
honor,
has
invest
most
of
its
asset
money
in
the
government
bonds,
and
by
enlarge
its
income
consist
of
the
return.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
yes.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
not
in
the
year
crediting,
your
honor.
actually
what
happens
is
the
fslic
does
not
earmark
its
bonds
as
between
primary
and
secondary,
it
reports
all
of
its
investment
income
as
income,
and
then
it
deducts
from
that
whatever
return
is
credited
to
the
secondary
reserve.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
no,
the
$886,000.00
was
just
solely
the
amount
we
paid
in
this
year,
1963.
the
account
has
subsequently
been
credited
with
this
increment.
but
the
--
and
so,
the
amount
is
credited
to
the
secondary,
is
then
up
among
the
various
savings
and
loan
in
accordance
with
their
respective
accounts.
now
the
revenue
ruling,
which
was
past
upon
by
the
internal
revenue
service
on
this
whole
question,
held
that
the
secondary
premium
payments
were
not
deductible
because
of
all
of
these
limitations
and
possibilities
of
refund
whatnot.
but
then,
they
ruled
on
the
question
whether
these
credits
of
income
would
be
taxable
as
income,
and
the
revenue
ruling
holds
that
no
--
the
income
is
not
subject
to
a
taxpayer’s
demand
and
is
so
fettered
with
conditions
that
is
not
received
either
rationally
or
constructively.
and
so,
the
ruling
is
that
the
return
is
not
taxable
at
the
time
is
credited,
but
it
will
be
taxable,
become
taxable
when
and
if
there
are
transfers
made
from
the
secondary
reserve
to
the
primary
reserve.
now
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it's
a
wash
transaction.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it
was
really
not
the
ninth
circuit,
when
we
finished
our
argument,
there
said
and
asked
us
if
we
would
next
time
bring
a
complicating
case.
i
tell
you
the
complication
arising
out
of
what
had
just
been
mentioned
here
is
tremendous.
actually,
the
industry
is
facing
this
exact
situation
right
now,
where
in
1970,
there
were
transfers
made
out
of
the
secondary.
and
the
associations
don’t
know
what
was
transferred,
whether
their
contributions,
whether
the
income,
and
therefore,
my
recollection
is
that
the
only
instructions
they
have
so
far
from
the
fslic
is
to
treat
it
the
way
you
want
it.
but
it
is
true
that
as
far
as
the
income
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
be
it
would
be
a
wash
transaction.
the
income
would
become
taxable
and
then
it
would
be
deductible
because
it
applied
on
this
obligation.
but
the
whole
business
of
credit
in
this
return,
forgetting
for
a
moment
the
possibility
of
refunds
on
termination
or
liquidation,
really
is
of
no
great
moment.
the
amount
that’s
credited
from
the
primary
reserve
to
the
secondary
reserve
simply
increases
the
secondary
and
decreases
the
primary.
and
yet,
any
benefit
to
be
derived
by
any
taxpayer,
depends
upon
when
the
combined
primary
and
secondary
reserves
reach
2%,
so
that
the
mere
fact
the
one
is
increased,
and
the
other
decreased,
really
is
not
that
significant.
one
of
the
final
arguments
of
the
government
and
in
this
respect,
the
reliance
was
placed
primarily
upon
an
argument,
which
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states
developed,
and
that
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
proves
that
the
payment
is
not
an
insurance
premium,
but
was
intended
as
a
capital
investment
in
the
fslic.
we
have
searched
the
legislative
history
and
can
find
nothing
in
support
of
this
argument.
the
tax
court
even
said
that
the
secondary
reserve
and
the
stock
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
were
fungible,
which
to
us
indicated
a
failure
to
grasp
the
completely
different
functions
of
the
two
agencies.
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
is
a
credit
organization
and
an
association
by
stock
in
that
board,
and
thereby
becomes
entitled
to
borrow
from
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
fslic
is
solely
an
insurance
company
and
is
concerned
solely
with
insuring
the
accounts
of
the
savings
depositors
of
the
fslic.
the
only
reference
between
the
two
in
congress
was
that
in
order
to
lighten
the
financial
burden
upon
taxpayers
that
had
to
pay
the
addition
of
2%
insurance
premium.
the
amount
required
to
be
paid
in
for
the
bank
stock
was
reduced
from
2
to
1%
because
as
congress
said
there
was
general
agreement
that
the
bank
was
overcapitalized,
whereas,
the
insurance
company
needed
to
greatly
expand
its
insurance
reserves.
other
--
there
is
no
connection
whatsoever
in
function
or
purpose
of
the
two
payments,
and
we
think
the
fundamental
fallacy
of
the
tax
court
here
was
this
point
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
capital
because
it
was
fungible
with
a
bank
stock.
we
think
if
there's
absolutely
no
basis
for
that.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
covers
most
of
our
arguments,
other
than
those
that
we’ve
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
this
is
a
complicated
thing.
we
certainly
agree
with
the
government
that
really
the
essence
of
these
payments
should
govern
whether
they
are
deductible
expenses.
we
think
that
the
government
concedes
that
they
were
necessary
expenses.
we
think
the
fact
show
that
they
are
ordinary
and
it
all
goes
faced
in
a
similar
situation
to
pay
them.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
was
any
element
of
the
capital
expenditure
or
a
capital
investment
involved
here.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
certainly
in
agreement
with
the
government
here
that
this
question
not
to
turn
upon
what
the
payments
in
question
really
are
or
were.
it
is
a
taxpayer’s
position
that
in
essence
the
payments
were
primarily
insurance
premiums
and
constituted
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses.
to
go
back
to
1961,
when
the
legislation
in
question
was
introduced,
each
association
was
required
to
pay
an
insurance
premium
of
1/12
of
1%
of
its
savings
accounts
and
creditor’s
obligations.
i
will
not
keep
repeating
creditor’s
obligations,
but
i
refer
to
them
by
including
them
in
savings
accounts.
had
the
savings
and
loan
industry
remained
static,
those
insurance
premiums
of
1/12
of
1%
would
have
produced
a
2%
reserve
in
approximately
24
years.
but
of
course
with
tremendous
growth
of
the
savings
and
loan
association,
to
continue
to
collect
only
1/12
of
1%
did
not
keep
pace
with
the
ultimate
insurance
risk,
which
the
statute
has
imposed
upon
the
fslic.
and
therefore,
congress
when
it
introduced
the
act
in
question,
stated
in
both
of
the
committee
reports,
that
there
is
general
agreement
that
some
action
should
be
taken
to
build
up
the
corporation’s
reserves
at
a
faster
rate,
after
pointing
out
the
extent
to
which
they
had
declined.
and
therefore,
the
legislation
took
the
form
of
continuing
the
premium
of
1/12
of
1%,
but
the
additional
element
that
was
then
introduced
was
that
if
any
association
had
an
increase
in
its
insurance
--
in
its
savings
deposits;
it
would
have
to
pay
this
additional
premium
of
2%
of
the
amount
of
the
increase.
and
to
us
it
is
significant
that
this
is
right
in
line
with
the
element
of
a
premium
for
insurance,
it's
an
attempt
to
measure
the
cost
of
protection
by
the
increased
risk
that
the
insurance
is
company
is
put
to.
for
example,
in
our
particular
case,
lincoln’s
savings
accounts
at
the
beginning
of
1962
amounted
to
approximately
$90
million
and
they
increase
during
1962
to
$135
million,
with
the
result
that
the
potential
insurance
risk
of
the
fslic,
which
it
was
obliged
by
law
to
insure
was
increased
by
$44
million.
and
to
us,
the
essence
of
what
congress
required
was
that
because
of
the
additional
insurance
risk,
thus
imposed
upon
the
fslic,
thus
should
be
paid
a
2%
of
that
increase
as
a
premium.
not
a
premium
to
take
effect
10
years
later
when
there
might
be
a
bookkeeping
entry
transferring
an
amount
from
a
secondary
reserve
to
a
primary
reserve,
but
an
insurance
risk
that
it
was
assumed
immediately
in
1962
because
of
the
increased
savings
accounts
of
lincoln
savings
and
loan
association.
so
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
basically
the
nature
and
the
substance
of
what
was
paid
was
a
premium
measured
directly
to
the
increased
insurance
risk
assumed
by
the
fslic
and
therefore,
it
meets
basically
the
criteria
of
an
ordinary
expense.
on
the
other
hand,
undoubtedly
may
have
been
associations,
which
experienced
no
increase
in
their
savings
deposits,
as
such
an
association,
there
would
have
been
no
increase
insurance
risk
assumed
by
the
fslic,
there
would
have
been
no
increase
premium
paid
by
such
an
association
which
to
us
gives
further
illustration
of
the
fact
that
this
really
was
in
essence
the
payment
for
an
insurance
risk.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
true,
your
honor,
because
there
would
be
no
payment
due.
in
other
words,
if
an
association
did
not
increase
its
deposits,
it
would
pay
nothing
more
than
the
original
1/12
of
1%.
it
would
not
pay
it
as
2%
and
therefore,
having
paid
nothing
that
of
course
wouldn’t
be
entitled
to
no
deduction.
the
government
has
argued
that
by
this
approach
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
let
me
carry
on
one
more,
what
then
is
the
statutory
purpose
in
setting
out
both
404
(b)
and
404
(d)?
why
do
you
think
they’re
separated?
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
this
will
have
to
be
my
own
personal
opinion,
because
i
cannot
climb
into
the
minds
of
congress,
but
i
think
it
was
primarily
a
device
to
bring
about
fairness.
the
plan
of
the
insurance
statute
from
the
very
beginning
has
been
that
there
will
come
a
time
when
the
reserves
reach
a
certain
point,
when
all
payment
of
insurance
premiums
will
be
suspended.
under
the
original
act,
it
was
5%
then
it
was
reduced
to
2%.
so,
there
has
been
inherent
in
every
payment
of
every
premium,
the
possibility
of
a
future
benefit,
when
that
reserve
reached
that
point.
now,
i
personally
think
the
reason
they
adopted
this
complicated
formula
and
said,
“we’ll
charge
the
growing
associations
an
additional
2%,”
was
that
when
the
combined
primary
and
secondary
reserve
should
reach
2%.
and
therefore,
there
should
be
a
suspension
of
payments,
under
the
congressional
determination
that
2%
was
enough
to
cover
the
risk,
that
early
suspension
would
be
available
only
to
the
growing
associations
which
had
paid
this
additional
premium.
whereas,
if
you
had
an
association
which
had
paid
no
secondary
premiums
and
therefore,
had
no
secondary
account,
there
would
be
nothing
to
transfer
on
their
account,
and
therefore
they
would
have
to
continue
to
pay
the
1/12
of
1%
premium
until
the
primary
premium
by
itself
got
to
be
2%.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
only
reason
for
this
exceedingly
technical
and
complicated
formula
was
set
up,
just
as
a
matter
of
fairness.
and
i
think
it
is
fair,
i
think
that
the
associations
that
had
been
growing
and
have
been
building
up
this
fund
and
paying
the
insurance.
when
the
2%
is
arrived
at
which
congress
thought
was
sufficient.
that’s
fine,
let's
give
these
associations
a
little
bit
of
(inaudible),
while
the
others
who
have
not
been
contributing
will
continue
until
all
of
the
funds
are
transferred
over
to
the
primary
reserve.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
correct.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
correct.
now,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
government
has
referred
to
this
transfer
of
a
part
of
the
lincoln’s
account
from
the
secondary
reserve
to
the
primary
reserve,
as
an
event
which
should
give
rise
to
a
deduction
at
that
time
and
also,
which
prevents
a
distortion
of
income.
i’d
like
to
just
call
your
attention
to
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
true
distortion
of
income.
under
the
government’s
theory,
and
as
the
government
said,
this
transfer
started,
as
far
as
lincoln
is
concerned
in
1970.
under
the
government’s
theory,
the
original
payment
of
this
$800,000.00
although
was
completely
beyond
the
control
of
the
taxpayer
and
in
our
view,
had
gone
for
insurance,
is
set
upon
the
taxpayer’s
book
as
an
asset.
now
in
1970,
when
the
whole
industry
reserve
gets
up
to
2%
and
instead
of
having
to
pay
the
original
1/12
of
1%,
the
taxpayer
has
the
benefit
of
having
transferred,
let's
say
$500,000.00
from
the
secondary
reserve
to
the
primary
reserve,
this
has
the
effect
on
the
financial
statements
of
the
taxpayer
of
telling
the
public
that
is
now,
its
net
worth
has
now
decreased
to
$500,000.00.
and
yet,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
day
before
that
transfer
was
made
and
the
day
after
that
was
made,
we
had
exactly
the
same
transfer,
as
far
as
anybody
can
tell
from
the
outside,
it's
worth
exactly
what
it
was
and
yet,
under
the
government’s
treatment,
you
show
a
decrease
in
net
worth
of
a
half
million
dollars.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
no,
your
honor,
because
under
the
government’s
theory,
the
expense
is
allowable
in
that
year
even
though
no
payment
is
due.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
if
i
understood
your
honor’s
point,
but
it
did—
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that
is
correct.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it's
seems
to
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
no,
i
think
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
the
way
it
has
worked
out
as
accounts
of
reaching
for
us
is
that
if
that
by
deducting,
in
other
words,
by
writing-off
this
asset
out
of
the
secondary
reserve,
which
appears
as
an
asset
on
the
balance
sheet.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
yes.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
this
is
the
way
the
government
would
handle
it.
this
is
the
way
we
are
required
to
do
it
by
our
regulatory
agency.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
right.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it's
just
allowed
as
a
deduction,
but
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
well,
that’s
true
your
honor.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
i
wish
that
were
better
account,
but
as
the
way
our
accounts
have
explained
to
me
that
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
that’s
true,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
i
must
say
that
sounds
right,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
[laughter]
yes,
sir.
now,
the
government
has
placed
stress
upon
this
question
of
the
fact
that
the
secondary
return
earns
a
rate
of
return
which
the
statute
requires
the
fslic
to
credit
to
the
secondary
accounts
and
it
is
true
that
the
law
does
require
such
a
credit.
we
have
gone
through
in
our
brief
the
presentation
in
the
committee
hearings
by
one
of
the
savings
and
loan
big
people
who
was
unhappy
that
this
return
was
not
going
to
be
paid
in
cash,
but
nothing
happened
with
that.
and
from
a
standpoint
of
the
taxpayer,
it
has
seemed
to
us
that
this
so-called
“return”
is
really
an
illusory
thing.
it
is
credited
to
the
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
the
fslic
your
honor,
has
invest
most
of
its
asset
money
in
the
government
bonds,
and
by
enlarge
its
income
consist
of
the
return.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
yes.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
not
in
the
year
crediting,
your
honor.
actually
what
happens
is
the
fslic
does
not
earmark
its
bonds
as
between
primary
and
secondary,
it
reports
all
of
its
investment
income
as
income,
and
then
it
deducts
from
that
whatever
return
is
credited
to
the
secondary
reserve.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
no,
the
$886,000.00
was
just
solely
the
amount
we
paid
in
this
year,
1963.
the
account
has
subsequently
been
credited
with
this
increment.
but
the
--
and
so,
the
amount
is
credited
to
the
secondary,
is
then
up
among
the
various
savings
and
loan
in
accordance
with
their
respective
accounts.
now
the
revenue
ruling,
which
was
past
upon
by
the
internal
revenue
service
on
this
whole
question,
held
that
the
secondary
premium
payments
were
not
deductible
because
of
all
of
these
limitations
and
possibilities
of
refund
whatnot.
but
then,
they
ruled
on
the
question
whether
these
credits
of
income
would
be
taxable
as
income,
and
the
revenue
ruling
holds
that
no
--
the
income
is
not
subject
to
a
taxpayer’s
demand
and
is
so
fettered
with
conditions
that
is
not
received
either
rationally
or
constructively.
and
so,
the
ruling
is
that
the
return
is
not
taxable
at
the
time
is
credited,
but
it
will
be
taxable,
become
taxable
when
and
if
there
are
transfers
made
from
the
secondary
reserve
to
the
primary
reserve.
now
--
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it's
a
wash
transaction.
mr.
adam
y.
bennion
it
was
really
not
the
ninth
circuit,
when
we
finished
our
argument,
there
said
and
asked
us
if
we
would
next
time
bring
a
complicating
case.
i
tell
you
the
complication
arising
out
of
what
had
just
been
mentioned
here
is
tremendous.
actually,
the
industry
is
facing
this
exact
situation
right
now,
where
in
1970,
there
were
transfers
made
out
of
the
secondary.
and
the
associations
don’t
know
what
was
transferred,
whether
their
contributions,
whether
the
income,
and
therefore,
my
recollection
is
that
the
only
instructions
they
have
so
far
from
the
fslic
is
to
treat
it
the
way
you
want
it.
but
it
is
true
that
as
far
as
the
income
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
be
it
would
be
a
wash
transaction.
the
income
would
become
taxable
and
then
it
would
be
deductible
because
it
applied
on
this
obligation.
but
the
whole
business
of
credit
in
this
return,
forgetting
for
a
moment
the
possibility
of
refunds
on
termination
or
liquidation,
really
is
of
no
great
moment.
the
amount
that’s
credited
from
the
primary
reserve
to
the
secondary
reserve
simply
increases
the
secondary
and
decreases
the
primary.
and
yet,
any
benefit
to
be
derived
by
any
taxpayer,
depends
upon
when
the
combined
primary
and
secondary
reserves
reach
2%,
so
that
the
mere
fact
the
one
is
increased,
and
the
other
decreased,
really
is
not
that
significant.
one
of
the
final
arguments
of
the
government
and
in
this
respect,
the
reliance
was
placed
primarily
upon
an
argument,
which
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states
developed,
and
that
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
proves
that
the
payment
is
not
an
insurance
premium,
but
was
intended
as
a
capital
investment
in
the
fslic.
we
have
searched
the
legislative
history
and
can
find
nothing
in
support
of
this
argument.
the
tax
court
even
said
that
the
secondary
reserve
and
the
stock
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
were
fungible,
which
to
us
indicated
a
failure
to
grasp
the
completely
different
functions
of
the
two
agencies.
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
is
a
credit
organization
and
an
association
by
stock
in
that
board,
and
thereby
becomes
entitled
to
borrow
from
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
fslic
is
solely
an
insurance
company
and
is
concerned
solely
with
insuring
the
accounts
of
the
savings
depositors
of
the
fslic.
the
only
reference
between
the
two
in
congress
was
that
in
order
to
lighten
the
financial
burden
upon
taxpayers
that
had
to
pay
the
addition
of
2%
insurance
premium.
the
amount
required
to
be
paid
in
for
the
bank
stock
was
reduced
from
2
to
1%
because
as
congress
said
there
was
general
agreement
that
the
bank
was
overcapitalized,
whereas,
the
insurance
company
needed
to
greatly
expand
its
insurance
reserves.
other
--
there
is
no
connection
whatsoever
in
function
or
purpose
of
the
two
payments,
and
we
think
the
fundamental
fallacy
of
the
tax
court
here
was
this
point
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
capital
because
it
was
fungible
with
a
bank
stock.
we
think
if
there's
absolutely
no
basis
for
that.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
covers
most
of
our
arguments,
other
than
those
that
we’ve
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
this
is
a
complicated
thing.
we
certainly
agree
with
the
government
that
really
the
essence
of
these
payments
should
govern
whether
they
are
deductible
expenses.
we
think
that
the
government
concedes
that
they
were
necessary
expenses.
we
think
the
fact
show
that
they
are
ordinary
and
it
all
goes
faced
in
a
similar
situation
to
pay
them.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
was
any
element
of
the
capital
expenditure
or
a
capital
investment
involved
here.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
