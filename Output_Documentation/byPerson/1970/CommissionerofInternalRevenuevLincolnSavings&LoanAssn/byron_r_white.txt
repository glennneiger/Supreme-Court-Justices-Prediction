one

question,
there's
a
bit
of
a
fuzz
in

company
brief,

i
don’t
find
it
cited
by

opposition
here
in
their
brief,
and
i
take
it
that
they’re
not
relying
on
it.

about

mr.

are
you

had
increased
substantially

one
whose
deposits
had
not
increased
substantially.
do
i
understand
you
to
imply,

don’t
think
you
said
it
bluntly,
that
for
the

there
would
be
