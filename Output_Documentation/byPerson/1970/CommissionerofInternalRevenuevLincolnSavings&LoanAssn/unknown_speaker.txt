unknown
speaker
at
least,
did
once?
unknown
speaker
to
be
added
to
its
rebate?
unknown
speaker
make
a
purchase.
unknown
speaker
but
a
capital
expenditure
as
defined
in
263
(a)
at
least
in
those
definitions
and
other
carries
other
similar
law
not
be
the
kind
dealt
with
last
term
in
woodward
nor
it
be
the
kind
of
somewhere
under
the
general
category
of
brokerage
should
be.
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
be
expenditures
that
could
be
depreciated
annually.
depreciated
that’s
what
263
(a)
says
to
me.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
actually
had
to
put
out
money
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
--
in
another
year
you
wouldn’t
have
to
actually
deplete
the
resources
of
the
company
--
unknown
speaker
or
you
just
put
the
same
asset
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
is
reducing
the
$886,000.00
by
$500,000.00?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
way
your
accounting
is
handled?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
asset
which
had
appeared
as
$886,000.00
would
now
appear
at
$386,000.00?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
half
million,
it’s
now
a
deductible
expense
by
reason
of
change,
what
happened
to
that?
unknown
speaker
but
cash
outlay
would
have
been
paid
out.
otherwise,
are
still
in
your
--
it's
in
your
cash
register.
unknown
speaker
well,
--
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
now
if
your
cash
balance
had
shown
$2.5
million,
but
you
would
have
to
pay
out
cash
(inaudible)
plus
$886,000.00?
unknown
speaker
how
will
you
deal
with
the
$500,000.00
plus
fees,
exactly
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
what’s
suppose,
do
you
mean
by
that?
unknown
speaker
so
does
this
mean
that
if
your
contribution
were
half
million
dollars
in
the
secondary
reserve
and
the
secondary
reserve
have
earned
enough
so
that
half
million
now
conspired
$125,000.00,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
have
to
return
$25,000.00
as
income?
unknown
speaker
that
even
the
$886,000.00
in
you
balance
sheet
include
an
(inaudible)
in
the
secondary
reserve
by
use
of
--
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
see.
you
have
$500,000.00
returns.
your
annual
premium
is
$100,000.00.
(inaudible)
paid
out
the
secondary
account
and
you
got
$500,000.00
that
you
invest.
in
the
60-year,
the
increment
is
huge
pay
return.
in
that
year,
you
get
the
increment
as
deduction
and
also
have
to
return
the
increment
as
income.
why?
unknown
speaker
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
government’s
position
as
to
1/12
premium?
unknown
speaker
does
the
government
the
same
year?
unknown
speaker
it’s
a
--
do
you
think
there
is
a
decree
to
this
prepaid
insurance?
unknown
speaker
and
in
here,
the
secondary
reserve
is
resorted
to
premium
payments,
there
are
no
payments
in
it
to
the
fund?
unknown
speaker
and
no
payments
under
the
secondary?
unknown
speaker
so
that
anything
except
the
secondary
reserve
are
never
been
paid
any
kind
of
reserves?
unknown
speaker
at
least,
did
once?
unknown
speaker
to
be
