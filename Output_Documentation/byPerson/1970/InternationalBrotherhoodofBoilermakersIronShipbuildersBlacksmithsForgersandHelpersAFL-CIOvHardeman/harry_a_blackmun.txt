justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
sherman,
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
may
i?
suppose
that
the
evidence
here
would
justify
or
would
qualify
only
under
article
xii
of
the
local’s
bylaws,
but
not
under
article
xiii.
would
expulsion
be
justified?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
would
say
this
because
why?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
article
xiii
provides
specifically
for
expulsion,
but
article
xii
does
not.
it
provides
only
for
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes
and
why
doesn’t
xii
go
farther
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
doesn’t
article
xii
go
further
--
farther?
why
doesn’t
it
also
provide
for
expulsion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
your
theory
must
be
then
that
the
language
as
warranted
by
the
offense
necessarily
includes
expulsion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
therefore,
you’re
argument
must
be
to
the
effect
that
conviction
so
to
speak
under
either
article
justifies
expulsion,
and
hence
the
general
verdict,
if
i
may
call
it
that
ties
in
to
evidence?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mcdonald,
let
me
add
to
this.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
think
it
brings
us
back
to
justice
white’s
question.
whose
function
is
it
to
interpret
article
xiii
of
the
constitution?
you
say
it
means
what
you
have
said
it
means.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
whose
function
is
it
to
interpret
that?
is
it
the
union’s
function?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it’s
perfectly
obvious
that
the
members
of
the
court
are
disturbed
about
how
you
reached
the
result
that
beating
up
the
business
agent
didn’t
create
dissention
among
the
members,
or
work
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
brotherhood.
and
you
say
it
didn’t
because
it
means
something
else.
i’m
asking
that
who
says
it
means
something
else?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mcdonald,
i
have
one
last
detail.
do
you
feel
that
entering
in
to
the
amount
of
this
verdict
was
anything
having
to
do
with
the
hiring
hall
practices?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
conceding
then
that
anything
having
to
do
with
the
hiring
hall
aspect
is
clearly
for
the
board?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
there
is
no
element
of
damage
in
this
result
that
is
attributable
to
the
hiring
hall
phase
of
this
controversy,
and
what
was
done
in
the
hiring
hall?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
what
i
understood,
you
just
now
to
say,
and
i
merely
asking
as
a
corollary
to
that
whether
you
are
conceding
that
anything
having
to
do
with
the
hiring
hall
is
for
the
labor
board
and
not
for
the
court.
