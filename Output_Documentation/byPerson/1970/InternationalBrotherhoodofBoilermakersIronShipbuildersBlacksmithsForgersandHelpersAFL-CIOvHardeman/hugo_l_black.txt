justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one?
how
much
of
the
damage
is
awarded
it
was
labeled
compensatory
or
how
much
punitive
compensatory
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
present
value
of
the
amount
he
would
have
recovered
had
he
remained
employed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
computed
on
that
basis
or
just
computed
on
the
basis
of
sum
as
per
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
i
just
thought
i
was
curious
for
a
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
remedy
could
he
get
to
go
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
damages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
damages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you’re
not
reading
from
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
it
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
one,
either
charges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
--
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
which
is
the
charge
there?
what’s
the
charge
against
him
under
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
permit
me
to
say
so,
i
frankly
do
not
at
all
understand
what
you
are
offering
as
a
defense.
as
i
understand,
the
charge
was
that
one
man
came
down
from
his
office
into
a
hallway
or
something,
and
another
one
assaulted
him
and
beat
him
up,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
defending
on
the
ground
that
he
didn’t
assault
him
and
beat
him
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
central
thing
they
charged
against
him,
wasn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
hold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
ended
so
far
as
they
were
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
conclusion
did
he
reach?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
end
of
it
so
far
as
the
lodge
was
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
he
not
attack
that
in
court?
that
proceeding
rather
than
sue
for
damages,
if
his
effort
was
to
get
back
in
the
lodge
and
proved
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
wrong,
why
not
go
to
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
can
work
it
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn’t
want
to
get
back
to
him,
well
how
can
he
get
damages
for
not
getting
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
going
to
court
to
see
whether
his
expulsion
was
right
or
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
this
court
here
try
that
question
as
to
whether
he’d
been
properly
expelled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
never
been
tried
at
all
then,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
have
a
full
one
because
you
didn’t
go
and
ask
for
judicial
review,
if
you
didn’t
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don’t
understand
how
you
could
attack
this
expulsion
without
attacking
it
directly
in
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
we
did
from
another
case,
but
you
say
you
didn’t
try
it
out
in
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
show
that
he
was
improperly
expelled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
did
you
just
submit
this
technical
argument
you
have
about
the
two
charges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don’t
see
how
they
could
reach
a
conclusion
myself
or
you
may
explain
it
to
me.
and
then
what
happened
here
in
the
alternate
attack,
beaten
up
and
they
go
ahead
and
try
him,
how
they
can
say
that
that
did
intend
to
create
dissention
among
the
brethren
so
to
speak?
justice
hugo
l.
black

did
