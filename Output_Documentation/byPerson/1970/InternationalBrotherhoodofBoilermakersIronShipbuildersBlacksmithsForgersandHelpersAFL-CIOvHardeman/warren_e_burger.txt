the

chief

e.

would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little
counsel,
a
little
hard
for
us
to
hear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
this
is
somewhat
like
a
situation
where
a
man
is
convicted
in
the
criminal
case
on
two
counts.
each
of
which
as
a
five
year
penalty,
but
he’s
given
two
five
year
sentences
to
run
concurrently.
and
this
situation
is
somewhat
analogous
to
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcdonald.
at
the
outset,
if
i
have
a
proper
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion,
court
of
appeals
said
that
when
the
member
of
the
union
beat
up
one
of
the
leaders,
this
was
not
a
violation
of
the
clause.
this
was
not
creating
dissention
among
members
and
not
working
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
international
brotherhood.
that’s
in
effect
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that’s
what
you
have
to
sustain
here
that
this
punching
the
nose,
beating
whatever,
however
you
describe
it,
did
not
violate
either
one
or
both
of
those
two
clauses
i
just
read?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’ll
call
for
some
explanation
for
me,
so
i
hope
at
sometime
in
your
argument
you’ll
dwell
on
it
a
little
bit
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
situation
would
be
any
different
if
instead
of
saying
“guilty
as
charged”
they
said
“we
find
the
two
brothers
guilty”
and
then
recited
the
original
charge
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me
how
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
defense
legal
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
ask
for
some
sort
of
special
verdict
here?
did
he
ask
if
they
give
him
a
bill
of
particulars
in
anyway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
be
if
he
didn’t
ask
for
what
you’re
asking
for
now,
that
might
have
a
lot
to
do
whether
he
was
entitled
to
it,
or
whether
he
waived
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
stopped
you
from
asking
for
it,
because
you’re
asking
for
it
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
work
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
brotherhood.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
to
pursue
your
analogy,
i
go
back
to
what
i
suggested
before.
what
if
in
that
criminal
case
he
had
only
received
the
penalty
for
one
of
the
two
crimes,
and
the
penalties
were
penalties
which
could
be
the
same.
then
we
--
don’t
the
courts
constantly
affirm
convictions
on
the
ground
that
they
don’t
need
to
reach
the
question,
they
don’t
need
to
survive
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
will
look
at
the
books,
you’ll
find
they
do
with
a
great
deal.
if
he’s
guilty
of
one,
they
don’t
reach
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
here
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
see
if
this
is
the
heart
of
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said
“the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
guilt
under
article
xiii
of
the
constitution.
that’s
the
one
that
deals
with
endeavoring
to
create
dissention
or
working
against
the
interest
of
harmony.”
now,
if
that
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
saying
there’s
no
evidence
to
support
that
then
the
case
was
wrongly
decided,
was
it
not?
