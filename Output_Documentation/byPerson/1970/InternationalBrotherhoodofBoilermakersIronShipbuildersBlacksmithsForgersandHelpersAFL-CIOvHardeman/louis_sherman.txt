mr.

thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
a
per
curiam
opinion
affirming
a
decision,
the
judgment
and
jury
verdict
of
the
district
court
in
the
amount
of
$152,500.00.
in
favor
of
george
hardeman,
an
expelled
member
of
the
boilermakers
union,
who
filed
a
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court
april
1966
under
section
102
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
alleging
that
he’d
been
deprived
of
the
full
and
fair
hearing
under
section
101
(a)
(5).
the
evidence
at
the
district
court
trial
was
of
two
kinds.
first,
the
various
proceedings
before
the
union
tribunals,
such
as
the
172
page
transcript
of
record,
of
the
hearing
that
was
held
which
resulted
in
his
expulsion,
which
went
in
to
the
details
of
his
beating
up
the
business
manager,
which
is
the
principal
reason
for
his
expulsion,
and
the
proceedings
at
higher
levels
when
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
president
of
the
international
and
the
executive
counsel
of
international.
the
second
evidence
had
to
do
with
loss
of
wages
which
are
computed
on
the
basis
of
past
and
future.
mr.
hardeman
was
43
when
this
incident
occurred
in
october
of
1960,
and
they
figured
it
on
the
basis
of
mortality
tables
that
he
would
retire
at
65,
$6,000.00
and
therefore
plus
some
punitive
damages
that
came
out
of
this
total
figure.
now,
the
first
part
of
the
case
has
to
do
with
the
issue
of
full
and
fair
hearing
which
is
set
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
the
language
of
section
101
(a)
(5)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
which
states
that
“no
member
of
any
labor
organization
must
be
fined,
suspended,
expelled
or
otherwise
disciplined
except
for
non-
payment
of
dues,
unless
its
members
been
(a)
served
with
written
specific
charges
(b)
given
the
reasonable
time
to
prepare
the
defense
(c)
afford
with
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
there’s
no
issue
here
on
the
written
specific
charges
they
were
made,
whether
he’s
given
a
reasonable
time
to
prepare
his
defense.
the
issue
is
whether
he
is
afford
to
full
and
fair
hearing.
in
the
literal
sense,
there
should
be
no
question
of
that
either,
because
the
hearing
took
about
ten
hours,
there
were
witnesses,
cross-examination
and
the
rest.
we
concede
full
and
fair
hearing
means
something
more
than
that,
that
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
support
the
charges.
and
we
think
that
the
trial
judge
erred
and
this
court
of
appeals
erred
in
a
way
that’s
very
important
to
the
labor
movement
at
finding
there
was
no
evidence.
the
essential
charges
had
to
do
with
the
bylaws
of
the
local
union
which
was
set
forth
at
page
4
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
of
the
boilermakers
relating
to
subordinate
lodges.
a
first
test
of
the
bylaws,
they’re
very
explicit
that
the
local
could
after
proper
hearing,
punish
as
warranted
by
the
offense
for
violation
which
is
defined
as
“violence,
a
threat
thereof
to
intimidate
any
official
of
this
international
brotherhood
a
subordinate
lodge.
prevent
or
attempt
to
prevent
him
from
proper
discharging
his
duties
of
his
office.”
and
the
language
of
the
subordinate
lodge
constitution
was
broader.
it
provided
for
expulsion
for
any
member
endeavors
to
create
dissention
among
the
members,
or
who
works
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
brotherhood.
now,
there’s
no
question
about
the
evidence
in
my
judgment
as
to
the
bylaw.
we
have
a
clear
statement
not
drawn
by
opposition
witnesses
but
by
mr.
hardeman
himself
in
the
union
case.
this
is
the
case
before
the
union
judges,
if
i
may
use
the
expression.
but
i
think
it
might
be
just
rather
read
it
literally.
he
was
unhappy
about
the
way
the
business
manager
was
administering
a
referral
system
as
far
as
his
own
particular
problems
were
concerned.
like
some
other
people,
he
was
thinking
in
terms
of
a
quick
instrument
of
change,
violence.
so
he’s
sitting
there
in
the
union
hall,
and
this
is
his
language
at
page
25.
”i
tried
to
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
whether
to
sue
the
local
or
wise,
who
is
the
business
manager,
or
beat
the
hell
out
of
wise.
and
then
i
made
up
my
mind.”
now,
that
would
seem
to
be
pretty
good
evidence
of
violation
of
the
bylaw.
the
district
judge
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
which
is
set
forth
in
our
appendix.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
sherman
he
did
exactly
what
he
had
in
mind,
which
was
to
beat
the
business
manager.
mr.
louis
sherman
beat
the
business
manager,
physically
assaulted
him.
he
didn’t
choose
the
more
peaceful
method
of
suing,
of
going
to
the
joint
referral
committee
which
existed
for
complaints
of
the
sort
he
had
in
mind.
he
beat
him
until
he
got
some
kind
of
statement
that
satisfied
him
that
wise
wouldn’t
jump
at
anyone
on
the
list.
that
was
the
issue
between
them.
now
when
it
got
to
the
district
court,
of
course,
if
you
get
the
time
relation
straight,
the
incidents
occurred
in
1960
and
this
case
was
before
the
federal
district
court
in
1968
i
suppose
when
the
trial
took
place.
complaint
was
filed
in
1966.
and
if
i
may
be
indulged,
i’d
like
to
read
the
statement
of
the
charge
which
is
at
our
appendix
page
37.
this
is
the
federal
district
court,
now
there
maybe
and
i’m
not
ruling
on
it
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i
will
say
this
that
there
is
evidence
in
here
which
might
support
a
finding
of
guilty
under
section
1
of
article
xii,
the
subordinate
lodge
by-laws,
where
the
trial
body
said
“we
find
him
guilty;
we
recommend
that
he
be
expelled.”
they
didn’t
say
“we
find
him
guilty
under
either
one
section
or
the
other.”
they
said
they
found
him
guilty
as
much
as
nothing
here
which
will
support
a
conviction
under
this
section,
and
i
think
the
verdict
cannot
stand,
and
he’s
being
convicted
a
felony
which
was
expelling
him.
and
i
think
in
as
much
there’s
no
evidence
which
will
support
finding
of
guilty
under
this,
of
the
finding
of
the
board
was
erroneous
and
cannot
stand
in
that
respect.
now,
that
is
all
charge,
for
those
two
sections
and
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
just
to
--
finding
him
guilty
under
those
sections.
now
the
use
of
the
phrase
“those
sections”
sounds
like
he’s
talking
about
both
sections.
it’s
very
difficult
to
understand.
all
of
it
is
about
the
fight.
i’m
telling
you
as
a
matter
of
law
that
under
the
proof
for
finding
its
result
it's
being
expelled,
can
i
legally
stand,
therefore
he
is
wrongfully
expelled.
now
the
second
issue
before
the
union
tribunal
was
a
question
of
the
violation
of
the
subordinate
lodge
constitution
dealing
with
dissention,
a
work
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
lodge.
but
we
think
that
in
terms
of
the
normal
relationships
between
the
courts
at
union
tribunals.
if
union
tribunals
are
to
be
permitted
to
function
in
accordance
with
the
realities
of
life
recognizing
that
they
are
not
literate
and
skilled
lawyers
that
there
must
be
some
recognition
of
whether
they
have
done
justice
in
the
real
sense,
or
whether
they
have
engaged
in
handling
a
trumped
up
case
or
something
of
that
sort.
there’s
nothing
trumped
up
about
this
case.
counsel
for
mr.
hardeman
admits
in
his
brief
that
he
should’ve
been
disciplining
because
of
the
question
about
the
punishment.
but
this
question
of
dissention
--
working
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
lodge,
the
local
trial
board
found
him
guilty
on
that
account.
now
those
are
general
words,
but
we
think
it
was
reasonable
for
the
brothers
to
define
dissention
and
harmony
the
way
they
did.
we
think
that
the
process
of
reasonable
inference
is
available
to
administrative
tribunals,
and
therefore,
it
certainly
should
be
available
to
working
people
who
are
trying
to
work
out
their
problems
of
maintaining
the
integrity
of
their
institutions.
what
could
be
more
calculated
to
cause
dissention
than
a
fist
fight?
now
this
wasn’t
just
a
fist
fight
between
two
boilermakers.
it’s
a
fist
fight
in
which
one
boilermaker,
the
soul
the
business
manager
who
was
not
a
very
important
fellow
in
this
world,
but
on
the
little
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
he
was
found
guilty
as
charged.
it
was
meant
that
he
was
found
guilty
on
both
counts
by
the
local
body.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
i
defended
on
both
counts.
i
considered
that
there
was
adequate
evidence,
certainly
was
some
evidence.
i
feel
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
most
strict
rules,
there
was
definite
evidence
of
violation
of
both
of
the
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
know
that.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we’ve
cited
burke
versus
boilermakers
which
pointed
that
it’s
sort
of
silly
to
expect
unions
to
say
“guilty
as
charged
on
count
one.
guilty
as
charged
on
count
two.”
mr.
louis
sherman
they
meant
--
mr.
louis
sherman
that’s
correct
because
the
language
of
the
bylaw
is
this
broad
that
it
omits
the
punishment
of
one
by
the
offense.
and
therefore,
expulsion
which
congress
recognizes
a
legitimate
punishment.
they
recognized
in
the
landrum-griffin
act.
they
recognized
it
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
certainly,
even
if
the
one
on
dissention
fell
out,
then
the
punishment
should’ve
been
upheld.
your
honors,
this
presents
a
more
serious
question
on
granting
an
award
which
seemed
to
be
inconsistent
of
our
system
trying
to
repair
injuries
if
injuries
had
been
received,
because
under
this
award
as
you
can
see
from
the
amounts
involved,
the
plaintiff
by
not
seeking
reinstatement.
he
didn’t
seek
reinstatement
in
this
case,
has
managed
to
create
pecuniary
result
in
which
he
acquires
in
the
state
wit
interest.
you
can
compute
with
a
low
rate,
should
take
care
of
the
salary.
it’s
just
inconsistent
of
the
whole
thing.
but
more
than
that,
what’s
involved
here
is
question
of
whether
unions
can
be
responsible.
i
beg
your
indulgence
to
read
from
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
rendered
by
judge
sobeloff.
“the
same
system
of
justice,
those
involved
in
the
case
of
hardeman
is
a
system
upon
which
the
responsibility
of
the
union
rests
in
terms
for
example
of
handling
lockout
strikers.”
now,
that’s
not
just
a
figment
of
my
imagination.
the
parts,
cases
and
illustrations
of
what
happens
when
the
union
tries
to
assert
its
powers
to
maintain
the
validity
of
peaceful
institutions,
in
that
case
the
maintenance
of
a
council
industrial
relations,
just
maintain
peace
in
the
electoral
contracting
industry
for
50
years.
judge
sobeloff
said
“by
the
judicial
application
of
ad
hoc
standards
and
the
pursuit
of
what
is
called
democracy
in
union
government
would
have
succeeded
only
introducing
not
democracy
but
chaos.
this
would
not
only
tend
to
disintegrate
the
labor
movement,
but
be
responsible
to
thus
generated
could
have
serious
implications
for
employers
and
others
as
well.”
and
that
is
one
of
the
serious
problems
facing
the
labor
movement
today
that
when
the
internationals
are
asked
to
assert
their
powers
to
maintain
responsibility
such
as
suppression
of
jurisdictional
strikes
that
the
cry
comes
back
“hide
and
protect
us
against
cases
like
hardeman.”
how
are
we
going
to
make
sure
we’re
going
to
do
the
job
to
satisfy
courts?”
of
course
we
can
tell
them
they’re
lawyers
that
reasonable
standards,
reasonable
risks
should
be
taken
as
they
were
in
the
parks
case.
but
cases
of
this
sort
which
have
been
smashed
aside,
i
think
complete
abandonment
of
the
proper
rules
of
review
and
the
substitution
of
the
court's
views
or
the
sort
of
thing
that
are
preventing
us
from
doing
what
should
be
done,
not
only
in
the
interest
of
the
labor
movement,
but
also
of
others
in
the
collective-bargaining
relationship.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
sherman
$152,500.00,
the
one
they
expelled
him
in.
in
the
parks
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
thousand
people.
the
case
of
berman
versus
nevada
which
is
at
85
pacific
second
250,
there
were
41
walkout
strikers
involved.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
because
the
blow
of
the
fist
is
the
thing
that
was
intended
to
be
suppressed,
and
that
was
because
in
working
out
the
allocation
of
jobs
resort
to
violence
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
concerned
with
the
administration
of
the
referral
system
are
very
serious
matter.
mr.
louis
sherman
punishment
as
warranted
by
the
offense.
mr.
louis
sherman
at
this,
punishment
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
sherman
well
i
think
that
it
depends
on
circumstances
of
the
case.
it’s
very
hard
for
a
court
at
any
level
to
appreciate
what
was
going
on
local
lodge
112
at
that
time.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
might
be
fine
and
might
be
suspension,
it
might
be
expulsion.
as
a
matter
of
fact
here,
they
expelled
him
indefinitely.
it’s
a
little
hard
to
understand
what
they
meant
by
that.
but
there
was
no
effort
made
on
his
part
securing
statement.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
sherman
but
essentially,
what
it
amounts
to
is
that
you
leave
in
the
hands
of
the
people
involved.
now
under
this
constitution,
the
local
union,
the
brothers
themselves
voted
for
expulsion.
they
had
the
trial
committee
that
considered
the
evidence
and
made
a
report
and
then
the
local
committee
voted
him
guilty
and
then
voted
expulsion.
so
therefore,
there
was
a
considered
determination
by
the
people
involved.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
burke
versus
boilermakers,
which
is
a
per
curiam
affirmance
by
the
ninth
circuit,
exactly
that’s
what
happened.
they
had
a
series
of
charges
on
which
one
fell
out.
the
court
said
there
was
no
evidence
on
one,
but
upheld
the
punishment
because
it
didn’t
approve
on
the
others.
we
have
cited
the
criminal
law
as
a
reason
for
the
position
to
be
taken.
i’d
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes.
mr.
louis
sherman
the
best
i
can
ascertain
$130,000.00
was
labeled
as
compensatory
and
$20,000.00
as
punitive.
it
was
not
labeled
but
the
presentation
of
the
position
by
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
was
that
he
was
43
years
old
and
he
would
retire
at
65,
and
the
number
of
years,
times
the
annual
salary
would
come
out
that
figure.
so
we
had
deduced
that
as
division
which
in
compensatory
and
punitive.
of
course
if
he’d
be
20
years
old
and
planned
the
work
in
70,
it
would’ve
been
a
lodge
of
judgment.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
--
mr.
louis
sherman
it
was
computed
on
the
basis
of
sum
as
per
year
because
although
they
recognized
the
principle
of
mitigation
of
damages,
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
evidence
before
the
jury
showed
that
he
was
living
on
$300.00
a
year
and
even
though
full
employment
was
coming
up,
they
didn’t
pay
any
attention
to
that.
but
i
don’t
want
to
bespeak
the
jury.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i’d
like
to
spend
a
minute
or
two
on
the
question
that
is
sometimes
labeled
preemption.
assuming
though
we
are
not
right
about
the
first
part
of
the
case
where
we
strongly
feel
we
are,
and
a
very
strong
public
reasons
for
establishing
the
rule
of
review
which
will
permit
the
union
tribunals
to
function.
i
don’t
think
the
word
preemption
is
quite
descriptive
of
our
problem
here.
we
have
a
case
in
which
the
federal
congress
has
adopted
a
statute
and
certainly
there
is
no
constitutional
bar
to
the
federal
government
adopting
the
statute
--
congress
adopting
the
statute
for
which
they
would
give
a
duplicate
remedy
on
the
so
called
refusal
of
referral.
there’s
a
lot
of
evidence
in
the
case
about
exclusive
referral
system,
non-exclusive
referral
system,
loss
of
wages
and
the
rest
of
it.
there
was
a
lot
of
junior
analogue
b
proceeding.
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
by
section
102
to
establish
a
duplicate
remedy.
we
think
there’s
an
amount
of
statutory
construction
that
it
did
not
so
intend.
we
recognize
that
if
you
take
a
dictionary
and
use
the
words
appropriate
relief
and
chase
it
down
to
the
end
of
the
scope
of
that
term,
we
may
come
out
with
the
answer,
but
yup,
they
did
intend.
but
i
think
it
is
sounding
like
amazon
continentals,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
back
if
’48
tried
to
find
the
basis
to
maintain
injunction
suits
against
picketing
because
the
language
of
the
statute
provided
that
unions
could
be
sued
for
the
first
time.
the
court
said
“well,
this
is
sort
of
ridiculous,
congress
trusted
that
function
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
a
centralized
agency
with
procedures
or
complaint,
trial
exam
and
a
hearing
and
a
centralized
agency
to
make
decisions,
didn’t
mean
to
transfer
the
function
to
200
or
more
local
tribunals
with
general
jurisdiction.”
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
i
think
we’re
looking
at
102.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
think
on
the
face
--
on
the
face
of
102,
it
looks
like
just
appropriate
relief.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
establish
a
duplicate
remedy,
but
it
did
not
do
so.
mr.
louis
sherman
oh!
that’s
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
louis
sherman
that’s
correct,
unless
he
had
sought
restoration
union
membership.
if
he
had
sought
restoration
union
membership,
then
he
would’ve
been
in
the
right
place.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
they
can
get
the
same
remedy
than
any
other
union
member
could
get
if
there’d
been
a
refusal
or
referral
because
of
trouble
with
the
union,
radio
officers
union
case.
he
could
get
the
same
remedy
that
any
non-union
person
could
get.
mr.
louis
sherman
back
pay
and
reinstatement
to
his
job.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
well
it
would
be
damages
in
the
sense
of
back
pay.
now,
in
addition,
i
think
that
some
of
the
trouble
on
this
point
arises
from
the
word
appropriate
relief
(including
injunctions).
we
check
back
over
the
legislative
history,
we
referred
to
it
on
vii
cited
second
volume
of
legislative
history
1102.
you
have
to
know
a
little
bit
of
the
background
of
this
legislation
to
realize
that
the
first
there
was
the
mcclellan
amendment,
the
bill
of
rights
which
came
up
on
the
floor
passed
by
a
very
narrow
vote,
and
then
as
evidenced
by
mcclellan’s
own
testimony,
the
labor
movement
got
involved
and
helped
to
draft
the
kuchel
substitute
which
is
intended
to
cut
down
the
scope
of
the
mcclellan
amendment.
so
we
look
at
the
mcclellan
amendment
and
that
provides
in
a
comparable
provision
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i’m
reading
from
a
copy,
i
regret
to
say
we
haven’t
put
it
in
the
brief.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
but
we’ve
cited
it
in
the
brief
at
page
7.
i’ll
just
take
one
minute
on
it.
the
secretary
of
labor
was
the
one
who
was
to
enforce
that
and
he
used
the
same
words,
appropriate
relief
but
without
limitations,
injunctions
or
restrain
any
such
violations
for
compliance
with
this
title.
we
submit
that
mcclellan
certainly
didn’t
have
in
mind,
congress
didn’t
have
in
mind
in
drafting
that
bill,
passing
that
bill,
but
the
secretary
of
labor
would
have
a
duplicate
function
administering
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
therefore,
it’s
a
fortiori
that
when
it
was
provided
for
by
private
action,
intended
to
cut
down
the
scope
of
the
mcclellan
amendment
that
there
was
no
such
intention.
mr.
louis
sherman
thank
you.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
one
small
point
and
that
is
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
defendant’s
exhibit
number
3
at
page
61,
which
is
the
out
of
work
card
of
the
union.
you
will
notice
that
the
rules
for
the
administration
to
hiring
all
the
set
forth
that
called
for
re-registration
each
month,
there
was
one
entry
on
march
08,
1961
where
he’s
apprising
out
for
a
job
where
he
was
lasted
for
five
days.
he
made
another
entry
on
april
’61
and
the
issue
really
was
whether
his
name
continued
on
the
list
as
a
legal
matter
because
it
had
been
on
once,
or
the
union
rule
prevailed
that
if
he
didn’t
re-register
each
month,
which
is
normally
accepted
rule
of
the
board,
that
he
was
eligible
for
further
referrals.
mr.
louis
sherman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
--
mr.
louis
sherman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
a
per
curiam
opinion
affirming
a
decision,
the
judgment
and
jury
verdict
of
the
district
court
in
the
amount
of
$152,500.00.
in
favor
of
george
hardeman,
an
expelled
member
of
the
boilermakers
union,
who
filed
a
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court
april
1966
under
section
102
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
alleging
that
he’d
been
deprived
of
the
full
and
fair
hearing
under
section
101
(a)
(5).
the
evidence
at
the
district
court
trial
was
of
two
kinds.
first,
the
various
proceedings
before
the
union
tribunals,
such
as
the
172
page
transcript
of
record,
of
the
hearing
that
was
held
which
resulted
in
his
expulsion,
which
went
in
to
the
details
of
his
beating
up
the
business
manager,
which
is
the
principal
reason
for
his
expulsion,
and
the
proceedings
at
higher
levels
when
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
president
of
the
international
and
the
executive
counsel
of
international.
the
second
evidence
had
to
do
with
loss
of
wages
which
are
computed
on
the
basis
of
past
and
future.
mr.
hardeman
was
43
when
this
incident
occurred
in
october
of
1960,
and
they
figured
it
on
the
basis
of
mortality
tables
that
he
would
retire
at
65,
$6,000.00
and
therefore
plus
some
punitive
damages
that
came
out
of
this
total
figure.
now,
the
first
part
of
the
case
has
to
do
with
the
issue
of
full
and
fair
hearing
which
is
set
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
the
language
of
section
101
(a)
(5)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
which
states
that
“no
member
of
any
labor
organization
must
be
fined,
suspended,
expelled
or
otherwise
disciplined
except
for
non-
payment
of
dues,
unless
its
members
been
(a)
served
with
written
specific
charges
(b)
given
the
reasonable
time
to
prepare
the
defense
(c)
afford
with
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
there’s
no
issue
here
on
the
written
specific
charges
they
were
made,
whether
he’s
given
a
reasonable
time
to
prepare
his
defense.
the
issue
is
whether
he
is
afford
to
full
and
fair
hearing.
in
the
literal
sense,
there
should
be
no
question
of
that
either,
because
the
hearing
took
about
ten
hours,
there
were
witnesses,
cross-examination
and
the
rest.
we
concede
full
and
fair
hearing
means
something
more
than
that,
that
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
support
the
charges.
and
we
think
that
the
trial
judge
erred
and
this
court
of
appeals
erred
in
a
way
that’s
very
important
to
the
labor
movement
at
finding
there
was
no
evidence.
the
essential
charges
had
to
do
with
the
bylaws
of
the
local
union
which
was
set
forth
at
page
4
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
of
the
boilermakers
relating
to
subordinate
lodges.
a
first
test
of
the
bylaws,
they’re
very
explicit
that
the
local
could
after
proper
hearing,
punish
as
warranted
by
the
offense
for
violation
which
is
defined
as
“violence,
a
threat
thereof
to
intimidate
any
official
of
this
international
brotherhood
a
subordinate
lodge.
prevent
or
attempt
to
prevent
him
from
proper
discharging
his
duties
of
his
office.”
and
the
language
of
the
subordinate
lodge
constitution
was
broader.
it
provided
for
expulsion
for
any
member
endeavors
to
create
dissention
among
the
members,
or
who
works
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
brotherhood.
now,
there’s
no
question
about
the
evidence
in
my
judgment
as
to
the
bylaw.
we
have
a
clear
statement
not
drawn
by
opposition
witnesses
but
by
mr.
hardeman
himself
in
the
union
case.
this
is
the
case
before
the
union
judges,
if
i
may
use
the
expression.
but
i
think
it
might
be
just
rather
read
it
literally.
he
was
unhappy
about
the
way
the
business
manager
was
administering
a
referral
system
as
far
as
his
own
particular
problems
were
concerned.
like
some
other
people,
he
was
thinking
in
terms
of
a
quick
instrument
of
change,
violence.
so
he’s
sitting
there
in
the
union
hall,
and
this
is
his
language
at
page
25.
”i
tried
to
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
whether
to
sue
the
local
or
wise,
who
is
the
business
manager,
or
beat
the
hell
out
of
wise.
and
then
i
made
up
my
mind.”
now,
that
would
seem
to
be
pretty
good
evidence
of
violation
of
the
bylaw.
the
district
judge
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
which
is
set
forth
in
our
appendix.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
sherman
he
did
exactly
what
he
had
in
mind,
which
was
to
beat
the
business
manager.
mr.
louis
sherman
beat
the
business
manager,
physically
assaulted
him.
he
didn’t
choose
the
more
peaceful
method
of
suing,
of
going
to
the
joint
referral
committee
which
existed
for
complaints
of
the
sort
he
had
in
mind.
he
beat
him
until
he
got
some
kind
of
statement
that
satisfied
him
that
wise
wouldn’t
jump
at
anyone
on
the
list.
that
was
the
issue
between
them.
now
when
it
got
to
the
district
court,
of
course,
if
you
get
the
time
relation
straight,
the
incidents
occurred
in
1960
and
this
case
was
before
the
federal
district
court
in
1968
i
suppose
when
the
trial
took
place.
complaint
was
filed
in
1966.
and
if
i
may
be
indulged,
i’d
like
to
read
the
statement
of
the
charge
which
is
at
our
appendix
page
37.
this
is
the
federal
district
court,
now
there
maybe
and
i’m
not
ruling
on
it
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i
will
say
this
that
there
is
evidence
in
here
which
might
support
a
finding
of
guilty
under
section
1
of
article
xii,
the
subordinate
lodge
by-laws,
where
the
trial
body
said
“we
find
him
guilty;
we
recommend
that
he
be
expelled.”
they
didn’t
say
“we
find
him
guilty
under
either
one
section
or
the
other.”
they
said
they
found
him
guilty
as
much
as
nothing
here
which
will
support
a
conviction
under
this
section,
and
i
think
the
verdict
cannot
stand,
and
he’s
being
convicted
a
felony
which
was
expelling
him.
and
i
think
in
as
much
there’s
no
evidence
which
will
support
finding
of
guilty
under
this,
of
the
finding
of
the
board
was
erroneous
and
cannot
stand
in
that
respect.
now,
that
is
all
charge,
for
those
two
sections
and
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
just
to
--
finding
him
guilty
under
those
sections.
now
the
use
of
the
phrase
“those
sections”
sounds
like
he’s
talking
about
both
sections.
it’s
very
difficult
to
understand.
all
of
it
is
about
the
fight.
i’m
telling
you
as
a
matter
of
law
that
under
the
proof
for
finding
its
result
it's
being
expelled,
can
i
legally
stand,
therefore
he
is
wrongfully
expelled.
now
the
second
issue
before
the
union
tribunal
was
a
question
of
the
violation
of
the
subordinate
lodge
constitution
dealing
with
dissention,
a
work
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
lodge.
but
we
think
that
in
terms
of
the
normal
relationships
between
the
courts
at
union
tribunals.
if
union
tribunals
are
to
be
permitted
to
function
in
accordance
with
the
realities
of
life
recognizing
that
they
are
not
literate
and
skilled
lawyers
that
there
must
be
some
recognition
of
whether
they
have
done
justice
in
the
real
sense,
or
whether
they
have
engaged
in
handling
a
trumped
up
case
or
something
of
that
sort.
there’s
nothing
trumped
up
about
this
case.
counsel
for
mr.
hardeman
admits
in
his
brief
that
he
should’ve
been
disciplining
because
of
the
question
about
the
punishment.
but
this
question
of
dissention
--
working
against
the
interest
and
harmony
of
the
lodge,
the
local
trial
board
found
him
guilty
on
that
account.
now
those
are
general
words,
but
we
think
it
was
reasonable
for
the
brothers
to
define
dissention
and
harmony
the
way
they
did.
we
think
that
the
process
of
reasonable
inference
is
available
to
administrative
tribunals,
and
therefore,
it
certainly
should
be
available
to
working
people
who
are
trying
to
work
out
their
problems
of
maintaining
the
integrity
of
their
institutions.
what
could
be
more
calculated
to
cause
dissention
than
a
fist
fight?
now
this
wasn’t
just
a
fist
fight
between
two
boilermakers.
it’s
a
fist
fight
in
which
one
boilermaker,
the
soul
the
business
manager
who
was
not
a
very
important
fellow
in
this
world,
but
on
the
little
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
he
was
found
guilty
as
charged.
it
was
meant
that
he
was
found
guilty
on
both
counts
by
the
local
body.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
i
defended
on
both
counts.
i
considered
that
there
was
adequate
evidence,
certainly
was
some
evidence.
i
feel
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
most
strict
rules,
there
was
definite
evidence
of
violation
of
both
of
the
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
know
that.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we’ve
cited
burke
versus
boilermakers
which
pointed
that
it’s
sort
of
silly
to
expect
unions
to
say
“guilty
as
charged
on
count
one.
guilty
as
charged
on
count
two.”
mr.
louis
sherman
they
meant
--
mr.
louis
sherman
that’s
correct
because
the
language
of
the
bylaw
is
this
broad
that
it
omits
the
punishment
of
one
by
the
offense.
and
therefore,
expulsion
which
congress
recognizes
a
legitimate
punishment.
they
recognized
in
the
landrum-griffin
act.
they
recognized
it
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
certainly,
even
if
the
one
on
dissention
fell
out,
then
the
punishment
should’ve
been
upheld.
your
honors,
this
presents
a
more
serious
question
on
granting
an
award
which
seemed
to
be
inconsistent
of
our
system
trying
to
repair
injuries
if
injuries
had
been
received,
because
under
this
award
as
you
can
see
from
the
amounts
involved,
the
plaintiff
by
not
seeking
reinstatement.
he
didn’t
seek
reinstatement
in
this
case,
has
managed
to

state
wit
interest.
you
can
compute
with
a
low
rate,
should
take
care
of
the
salary.
it’s
just
inconsistent
of
the
whole
thing.
but
more
than
that,
what’s
involved
here
is
question
of
whether
unions
can
be
responsible.
i
beg
your
indulgence
to
read
from
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
rendered
by
judge
sobeloff.
“the
same
system
of
justice,
those
involved
in
the
case
of
hardeman
is
a
system
upon
which
the
responsibility
of
the
union
rests
in
terms
for
example
of
handling
lockout
strikers.”
now,
that’s
not
just
a
figment
of
my
imagination.
the
parts,
cases
and
illustrations
of
what
happens
when
the
union
tries
to
assert
its
powers
to
maintain
the
validity
of
peaceful
institutions,
in
that
case
the
maintenance
of
a
council
industrial
relations,
just
maintain
peace
in
the
electoral
contracting
industry
for
50
years.
judge
sobeloff
said
“by
the
judicial
application
of
ad
hoc
standards
and
the
pursuit
of
what
is
called
democracy
in
union
government
would
have
succeeded
only
introducing
not
democracy
but
chaos.
this
would
not
only
tend
to
disintegrate
the
labor
movement,
but
be
responsible
to
thus
generated
could
have
serious
implications
for
employers
and
others
as
well.”
and
that
is
one
of
the
serious
problems
facing
the
labor
movement
today
that
when
the
internationals
are
asked
to
assert
their
powers
to
maintain
responsibility
such
as
suppression
of
jurisdictional
strikes
that
the
cry
comes
back
“hide
and
protect
us
against
cases
like
hardeman.”
how
are
we
going
to
make
sure
we’re
going
to
do
the
job
to
satisfy
courts?”
of
course
we
can
tell
them
they’re
lawyers
that
reasonable
standards,
reasonable
risks
should
be
taken
as
they
were
in
the
parks
case.
but
cases
of
this
sort
which
have
been
smashed
aside,
i
think
complete
abandonment
of
the
proper
rules
of
review
and
the
substitution
of
the
court's
views
or
the
sort
of
thing
that
are
preventing
us
from
doing
what
should
be
done,
not
only
in
the
interest
of
the
labor
movement,
but
also
of
others
in
the
collective-bargaining
relationship.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
sherman
$152,500.00,
the
one
they
expelled
him
in.
in
the
parks
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
thousand
people.
the
case
of
berman
versus
nevada
which
is
at
85
pacific
second
250,
there
were
41
walkout
strikers
involved.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
because
the
blow
of
the
fist
is
the
thing
that
was
intended
to
be
suppressed,
and
that
was
because
in
working
out
the
allocation
of
jobs
resort
to
violence
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
concerned
with
the
administration
of
the
referral
system
are
very
serious
matter.
mr.
louis
sherman
punishment
as
warranted
by
the
offense.
mr.
louis
sherman
at
this,
punishment
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
sherman
well
i
think
that
it
depends
on
circumstances
of
the
case.
it’s
very
hard
for
a
court
at
any
level
to
appreciate
what
was
going
on
local
lodge
112
at
that
time.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
might
be
fine
and
might
be
suspension,
it
might
be
expulsion.
as
a
matter
of
fact
here,
they
expelled
him
indefinitely.
it’s
a
little
hard
to
understand
what
they
meant
by
that.
but
there
was
no
effort
made
on
his
part
securing
statement.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
sherman
but
essentially,
what
it
amounts
to
is
that
you
leave
in
the
hands
of
the
people
involved.
now
under
this
constitution,
the
local
union,
the
brothers
themselves
voted
for
expulsion.
they
had
the
trial
committee
that
considered
the
evidence
and
made
a
report
and
then
the
local
committee
voted
him
guilty
and
then
voted
expulsion.
so
therefore,
there
was
a
considered
determination
by
the
people
involved.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
burke
versus
boilermakers,
which
is
a
per
curiam
affirmance
by
the
ninth
circuit,
exactly
that’s
what
happened.
they
had
a
series
of
charges
on
which
one
fell
out.
the
court
said
there
was
no
evidence
on
one,
but
upheld
the
punishment
because
it
didn’t
approve
on
the
others.
we
have
cited
the
criminal
law
as
a
reason
for
the
position
to
be
taken.
i’d
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes.
mr.
louis
sherman
the
best
i
can
ascertain
$130,000.00
was
labeled
as
compensatory
and
$20,000.00
as
punitive.
it
was
not
labeled
but
the
presentation
of
the
position
by
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
was
that
he
was
43
years
old
and
he
would
retire
at
65,
and
the
number
of
years,
times
the
annual
salary
would
come
out
that
figure.
so
we
had
deduced
that
as
division
which
in
compensatory
and
punitive.
of
course
if
he’d
be
20
years
old
and
planned
the
work
in
70,
it
would’ve
been
a
lodge
of
judgment.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
--
mr.
louis
sherman
it
was
computed
on
the
basis
of
sum
as
per
year
because
although
they
recognized
the
principle
of
mitigation
of
damages,
for
some
reason
or
other,
the
evidence
before
the
jury
showed
that
he
was
living
on
$300.00
a
year
and
even
though
full
employment
was
coming
up,
they
didn’t
pay
any
attention
to
that.
but
i
don’t
want
to
bespeak
the
jury.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i’d
like
to
spend
a
minute
or
two
on
the
question
that
is
sometimes
labeled
preemption.
assuming
though
we
are
not
right
about
the
first
part
of
the
case
where
we
strongly
feel
we
are,
and
a
very
strong
public
reasons
for
establishing
the
rule
of
review
which
will
permit
the
union
tribunals
to
function.
i
don’t
think
the
word
preemption
is
quite
descriptive
of
our
problem
here.
we
have
a
case
in
which
the
federal
congress
has
adopted
a
statute
and
certainly
there
is
no
constitutional
bar
to
the
federal
government
adopting
the
statute
--
congress
adopting
the
statute
for
which
they
would
give
a
duplicate
remedy
on
the
so
called
refusal
of
referral.
there’s
a
lot
of
evidence
in
the
case
about
exclusive
referral
system,
non-exclusive
referral
system,
loss
of
wages
and
the
rest
of
it.
there
was
a
lot
of
junior
analogue
b
proceeding.
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
by
section
102
to
establish
a
duplicate
remedy.
we
think
there’s
an
amount
of
statutory
construction
that
it
did
not
so
intend.
we
recognize
that
if
you
take
a
dictionary
and
use
the
words
appropriate
relief
and
chase
it
down
to
the
end
of
the
scope
of
that
term,
we
may
come
out
with
the
answer,
but
yup,
they
did
intend.
but
i
think
it
is
sounding
like
amazon
continentals,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
back
if
’48
tried
to
find
the
basis
to
maintain
injunction
suits
against
picketing
because
the
language
of
the
statute
provided
that
unions
could
be
sued
for
the
first
time.
the
court
said
“well,
this
is
sort
of
ridiculous,
congress
trusted
that
function
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
a
centralized
agency
with
procedures
or
complaint,
trial
exam
and
a
hearing
and
a
centralized
agency
to
make
decisions,
didn’t
mean
to
transfer
the
function
to
200
or
more
local
tribunals
with
general
jurisdiction.”
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
i
think
we’re
looking
at
102.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
think
on
the
face
--
on
the
face
of
102,
it
looks
like
just
appropriate
relief.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
establish
a
duplicate
remedy,
but
it
did
not
do
so.
mr.
louis
sherman
oh!
that’s
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
louis
sherman
that’s
correct,
unless
he
had
sought
restoration
union
membership.
if
he
had
sought
restoration
union
membership,
then
he
would’ve
been
in
the
right
place.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
they
can
get
the
same
remedy
than
any
other
union
member
could
get
if
there’d
been
a
refusal
or
referral
because
of
trouble
with
the
union,
radio
officers
union
case.
he
could
get
the
same
remedy
that
any
non-union
person
could
get.
mr.
louis
sherman
back
pay
and
reinstatement
to
his
job.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
well
it
would
be
damages
in
the
sense
of
back
pay.
now,
in
addition,
i
think
that
some
of
the
trouble
on
this
point
arises
from
the
word
appropriate
relief
(including
injunctions).
we
check
back
over
the
legislative
history,
we
referred
to
it
on
vii
cited
second
volume
of
legislative
history
1102.
you
have
to
know
a
little
bit
of
the
background
of
this
legislation
to
realize
that
the
first
there
was
the
mcclellan
amendment,
the
bill
of
rights
which
came
up
on
the
floor
passed
by
a
very
narrow
vote,
and
then
as
evidenced
by
mcclellan’s
own
testimony,
the
labor
movement
got
involved
and
helped
to
draft
the
kuchel
substitute
which
is
intended
to
cut
down
the
scope
of
the
mcclellan
amendment.
so
we
look
at
the
mcclellan
amendment
and
that
provides
in
a
comparable
provision
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i’m
reading
from
a
copy,
i
regret
to
say
we
haven’t
put
it
in
the
brief.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
but
we’ve
cited
it
in
the
brief
at
page
7.
i’ll
just
take
one
minute
on
it.
the
secretary
of
labor
was
the
one
who
was
to
enforce
that
and
he
used
the
same
words,
appropriate
relief
but
without
limitations,
injunctions
or
restrain
any
such
violations
for
compliance
with
this
title.
we
submit
that
mcclellan
certainly
didn’t
have
in
mind,
congress
didn’t
have
in
mind
in
drafting
that
bill,
passing
that
bill,
but
the
secretary
of
labor
would
have
a
duplicate
function
administering
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
therefore,
it’s
a
fortiori
that
when
it
was
provided
for
by
private
action,
intended
to
cut
down
the
scope
of
the
mcclellan
amendment
that
there
was
no
such
intention.
mr.
louis
sherman
thank
you.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
one
small
point
and
that
is
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
defendant’s
exhibit
number
3
at
page
61,
which
is
the
out
of
work
card
of
the
union.
you
will
notice
that
the
rules
for
the
administration
to
hiring
all
the
set
forth
that
called
for
re-registration
each
month,
there
was
one
entry
on
march
08,
1961
where
he’s
apprising
out
for
a
job
where
he
was
lasted
for
five
days.
he
made
another
entry
on
april
’61
and
the
issue
really
was
whether
his
name
continued
on
the
list
as
a
legal
matter
because
it
had
been
on
once,
or
the
union
rule
prevailed
that
if
he
didn’t
re-register
each
month,
which
is
normally
accepted
rule
of
the
board,
that
he
was
eligible
for
further
referrals.
