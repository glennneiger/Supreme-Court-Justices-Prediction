but
you
don’t
find
any
list
on
the
face
of
101
(a)
(5),
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
at
102,
you
find
that
on
the
face
of
102?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
your
argument,
the
fact
is
that
102
says
“this
is
available
to
you
unless
you
want
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
first.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
that’s
my
point.
therefore,
you
say
there’s
no
action
under
10
--
or
a
violation
of
101
(a)
(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
is
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
mcdonald,
i
think
you
may
have
gotten
it
without
asking
for
it,
didn’t
you?
on
page
57
of
the
record
in
the
letter
to
mr.
hardeman,
it
said
the
only
explanation
for
the
expulsion
penalty
is
article
xiii?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
certainly
referred
to
it
in
the
letter
explaining
what
happened
when
his
case
was
affirmed
in
the
union.
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
were
two
charges,
but
in
--
and
the
fact
that
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
charges.
but
then
this
says
that
article
xiii
carries
an
expulsion
record
and
so
he’s
expelled.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who’s
the
--
isn’t
the
top
authority
in
the
union
the
lodge
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn’t
you
appeal
to
the
lodge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
everybody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
61
votes
in
the
lodge
against
36
(2)
--
who
thought
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
13,
and
the
top
appellate
authority
in
construing
the
constitution
within
the
lodge
thought
it
was
a
violation
of
13.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren’t
those
actions
worth
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
without
knowing
anything
--
you
say
nobody
knew
anything
about
it
himself
unless
you
get
a
61
to
36
vote?
