mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
the
first
appearance
i’ve
made
before
this
honorable
court
and
i’d
like
to
say
that
it
is
an
honor
to
appear
here,
it’s
the
high
point
of
my
career.
this
case
is
here
on
two
issues
that
you
granted
certiorari
on,
the
issue
of
standard
of
review
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
and
the
issue
of
preemption.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
it
was
tried
in
mobile,
alabama
before
judge
daniel
thomas,
justice
black.
to
understand
the
standard
of
review,
i
might
recite
the
facts
as
chief
justice
burger
pointed
out.
the
union
trial
board
found
mr.
hardeman,
as
well
as
mr.
braswell,
because
we’re
also
reviewing
the
braswell
opinion
here,
guilty
of
two
charges.
article
xii,
section
1
and
article
xii,
section
1.
now,
what
they
had
done
in
affect
was
to
charge
them
with
those
two
charges.
the
trial
board
came
back
and
said
“we
find
you
guilty
as
charged.”
now,
we
came
into
court
alleging
in
our
complaint
that
we
have
been
denied
a
full
and
fair
hearing
because
the
evidence
did
not
support
a
finding
of
guilt
or
was
there
any
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
guilt
under
article
xiii,
section
1.
our
position
was
this
that
mr.
hardeman
as
well
as
mr.
braswell
were
in
the
same
position
as
a
man
on
trial
in
a
criminal
case
with
the
two-count
indictment.
one
count
charging
him
with
a
simple
assault,
the
second
count
charging
him
with
rape.
there
being
evidence
of
a
simple
assault
but
no
evidence
of
any
sexual
contact,
but
the
jury
coming
in
and
finding
him
guilty
as
charged,
well
guilty
as
charged
necessarily
includes
the
rape
count.
and
that’s
what
happened
here.
now,
we
had
two
counts
or
two
charges
against
mr.
hardeman
and
mr.
braswell
in
this
case,
and
the
first
charge
was
xii
(1)
which
stated
that
through
the
use
of
force
of
violence
that
hardeman
tried
to
restrain
course
or
intimidate
an
official
of
the
brotherhood,
the
second
charge
incidentally
there
is
no
punishment
set
forth
there,
it’s
open,
apparently
can
be
--
punishment
can
be
administered
according
to
the
offense.
and
the
second
charge
was
article
xiii,
section
1
of
the
international
constitution
which
points
out
that
any
member
who
creates
dissention
among
the
members
or
who
seeks
to
create
a
dissolution
of
the
brotherhood,
or
a
division
of
funds.
in
essence,
it
describes
someone
who
is
trying
to
dissolve
the
union
as
an
organization,
and
that
article
says
that
anyone
who
is
guilty
of
this
will
be
suspended,
will
be
--
not
suspended
but
expelled
from
the
brotherhood.
now,
it
doesn’t
leave
any
question.
there’s
no
lesser
penalty.
it’s
just
like
a
state
statute
that
says
“if
you
commit
first
degree
murder,
you
will
be
sentenced
for
life
or
your
life
will
be
taken
from
you.”
and
that’s
what
article
xiii
does,
it's
a
much
more
serious
penalty.
now,
when
he
was
found
guilty,
when
these
men
were
found
guilty,
the
expulsion
vote
that
mr.
sherman
mentioned
was
really
superfluous.
they
didn’t
need
--
if
they
hadn’t
done
it
or
if
they
voted
not
to
expel
them,
they
would’ve
still
been
expelled
by
virtue
of
the
fact
they
were
found
guilty
under
article
xiii,
section
1.
now,
it
should
be
noted,
these
gentlemen
took
necessary
appeals
in
the
union,
and
in
doing
so,
they
were
necessarily
prejudiced
in
their
defense
because
they
had
to
presume
they
were
found
guilty
of
both,
and
so
by
doing
this,
they
had
to
be
found
guilty
of
both.
now
the
trial
judge
doesn’t
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
do
think
it
would’ve
been
different.
if
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
i
think
this.
if
they
had
found
the
member
is
guilty
of
article
xii,
section
1,
they
could’ve
said
“for
a
penalty,
we
will
fine
you
$100.00
each
or
we
will
suspend
you
for
six
months”,
and/or
they
could’ve
said
“for
a
penalty,
we
will
leave
it
up
to
a
vote
of
the
brotherhood.”
and
when
it
came
before
the
brotherhood,
when
they
--
a
motion
for
expulsion
was
offered,
the
brotherhood
would’ve
said
“well,
no.
let’s
vote
against
this
because
it’s
too
harsh.”
as
it
was,
when
the
motion
for
expulsion
was
offered,
the
brotherhood
knew
they
had
been
found
guilty
of
a
section
demanding
expulsion,
so
why
not
go
ahead
and
vote
for
it.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
it’s
not.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
it
would
not
be
dissention
within
the
meaning
of
article
xiii
(1).
to
say
it
would,
would
be
if
you’d
be
guilty
of
dissention
under
xiii
(1)
in
doing
that,
well
then
you
could
also
say
that
someone
who
is
presumptive
enough
to
when
election
comes
around
to
run
against
the
business
agent
in
the
election
to
run
for
his
job.
now,
this
man
is
certainly
creating
more
dissention
in
the
union
and
causing
a
division
of
difference
of
opinion
there.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
my
understanding
of
course,
this
is
not
--
was
not
made
an
issue
of
the
case.
but
my
understanding
is
that
among
the
boilermakers
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
business
agent
to
be
punched.
now,
of
course
to
us
this
is
shocking,
because
we
don’t
carry
on
business
in
that
way,
but
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
but,
nonetheless,
the
members
could’ve
taken
if
they
found
them
guilty
only
on
the
article
xii
and
it
were
up
to
the
members
to
decide
the
punishment,
they
could
have
found
--
decided
a
punishment
that
would’ve
been
consistent
with
the
offense
in
the
context
of
the
way
they
carry
it
on
business.
but
having
found
him
guilty
under
xiii
(1),
then
they
had
no
choice
but
to
vote
for
expulsion
because
the
men
were
expelled
anyway
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
they
were
found
guilty,
the
constitution
demanded
it.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
but
i
do
not
think
that’s
of
course,
that
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
case
either,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well,
sir
that
was
not
within
the
procedure
of
the
union
remedies.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
i
did
not
notice
that
mr.
justice
white,
but
apparently
it
is.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
let
me
say
this
in
regard
to
that
standard
of
review.
the
standard
of
review
is
set
forth
by
congress
in
section
101
(a)
(5)
or
section
--
or
29
u.s.c.,
411
(5)
(c)
as
requiring
that
the
members
had
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
now,
all
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
admit
this
in
their
brief,
have
held
that
in
order
to
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
support
the
charge.
now
we
contended
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
not
some
evidence
to
support
the
charge.
and
their
brief
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
some
evidence
particularly
as
to
article
xiii,
section
1,
because
that
is
a
fair
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
automatic
expulsion.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
charge
is
that
he
created
dissention
among
the
membership
to
create
a
division
of
funds.
it’s
on
page
63
of
the
appendix.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
of
the
international
brotherhood,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
what
you
have
stated,
may
i
mr.
justice
black,
let
me
go
further.
what
you
have
stated
was
part
of
the
charge.
that
was
the
particular,
really
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
in
doing
that,
they
said
that
this
act
itself
is
a
violation
of
section
13
(1)
which
carries
with
it
an
automatic
expulsion.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
because
this
was
a
personal
thing
between
mr.
hardeman
and
the
business
agent
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
wasn’t
a
blow
aimed
at
dissolving
the
union.hardeman’s
motivation
was
not
to
attack
the
union
as
an
organizational
structure.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
i
submit
its
not,
because
i
submit
in
interpreting
this
section,
you
cannot
stop
right
there,
because
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
because
that
is
a
personal
thing
and
this
prohibits
an
attack
against
the
organization
itself,
the
organizational
structure.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
the
top
authority
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
white,
the
trial
was
in
the
lodge,
the
local
lodge,
and
appeal
went
to
the
executive
council
of
the
international.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
and
then
to
the
executive
president.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
i
don’t
think
that
is
the
case.
as
i
recall,
what
was
submitted
to
the
lodge
was
not
to
determine.
they
didn’t
--
the
lodge
did
not
hear
the
evidence
or
review
the
transcript.
all
that
was
submitted
to
the
lodge
was
a
motion
that
to
the
effect
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
pardon
me
sir,
you’re
in
the
appendix,
page
56.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
on
the
basis
that
at
a
meeting
a
motion
was
offered
to
the
membership
saying
“we
have
found
--
the
trial
board
has
heard
the
evidence,
and
having
heard
the
evidence,
they
find
him
guilty.
we
move
that
finding
of
the
trial
board
be
accepted.”
now
that
was
done
at
the
local
meeting
without
hearing
the
evidence
or
anything.
see,
that
was
still
on
the
local
lodge
level.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
only
thing,
mr.
justice
white,
the
only
thing
they
knew
about
was
discussion
among
around
the
hall.
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
it
does.
i
think
it
shows
that
a
motion
was
offered.
it
certainly
does
not
show
that
any
evidence
or
any
research
of
the
transcript
was
taken,
because
what
happened
in
this
case
was,
the
appeal
was
made
to
the
executive
council
who
held
a
trial
de
novo
and
retried
the
issues.
the
executive
council
being
appointed,
the
executive
council
of
the
international
union,
and
then
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
they
held
the
same
thing
as
the
guilty
as
charged
in
accepting
the
finding
of
the
trial
board.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
then,
to
further
exhaust
their
remedies,
they
took
an
appeal
to
the
international
president
of
the
union.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
he
examined
the
transcript
of
the
executive
council
hearing
and
of
the
local
lodge
hearing.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
he
reached
the
same
conclusion
not
to
disturb
the
finding.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that
was
the
end
of
it
as
far
as
the
whole
union
was
concerned.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
reason
he
did
not
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well,
the
reason
for
it,
mr.
justice
black
was
because
of
a
real
solution.
this
particular
boilermaker
was
in
the
construction
trade
and
as
he
expressed
it
to
get
back
into
the
union
forcibly
was
no
solution,
because
on
construction
jobs,
it
was
not
uncommon
that
accidents
happen
and
people
were
hurt
or
killed.
and
that
this
was
a
rough
group
and
he
feared
that
if
they
were
forced
to
take
him
back
that
his
days
might
be
numbered.
now
further
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
he
can
get
damages
under
section
412.
title
29,
section
412
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
says
that
any
person
who’s
rights
secured
by
the
--
any
provision
of
the
chapter
may
bring
a
civil
action,
which
is
commonly
construed
to
mean
all
the
damages,
or
anything
not
criminal
or
admiralty
there
for
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.
now,
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir,
that’s
what
the
act
says.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
this
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
the
whole
heart
of
this
damage
suit
is
that
the
complaint
says
that
we
were
improperly
expelled
because
we
did
not
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
and
therefore,
we
are
seeking
damages,
the
approximate
damages.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
we
had
a
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
we
did
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir
we
did,
and
i’m
sorry
i
misunderstood
you
justice
black.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that,
mr.
justice
black,
the
two
charges
was
the
basis
of
our
--
him
being
found
guilty
of
a
charge
for
which
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
him,
was
the
basis
of
our
theory
that
our
evidence
in
court
that
he
did
not
--
was
not
given
a
full
and
fair
hearing
because
he
was
at
same
position
as
a
man
on
trial
under
two-count
indictment
and
one
count
the
evidence
conformed
into
one
count
but
not
conformed
to
the
other.
the
jury
came
back
in
saying
“we
find
him
guilty
as
charged.”
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
because
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
the
point
here
mr.
justice
burger
is
that
if
he’s
guilty
of
one,
you’re
saying
here
is
that
he
could
get
the
same
punishment
under
both
charges.
but
on
the
other
hand
too,
he
could
get
a
lesser
punishment
under
the
charge
if
he
weren’t
found
guilty
of
the
charge
for
which
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that’s
true,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
all
of
the
transcript
and
the
evidence
that
was
taken
on
this
matter.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
it
should
be
the
plain
meaning
of
the
particular
charge
because
included
in
section
101
(a)
(5)
(b)is
a
requirement
that
the
member
be
given
specific
charges.
now,
if
congress
is
going
to
demand
that
he
be
given
specific
charges,
they
ought
to
demand
specific
proof.
it
would
not
be
a
fair
hearing.
there
are
many
things
as
to
questions
of
full
and
fair
hearing
is
a
broad
term.
but
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun,
when
you
read
the
article
together
in
its
context,
it
becomes
obvious
of
course,
maybe
it
doesn’t,
but
it
becomes
obvious
to
me
and
apparently
to
the
justices
who
have
reviewed
this
that
this
article
prohibits
some
attack
against
the
organizational
structure
itself.
and
that
we’re
not
saying
here
that
hardeman
should
not
have
been
disciplined.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
court
should
decide
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
a
particular
section.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
congress
has
issued
a
mandate
that
the
court
do
it,
because
congress
has
said
that
no
member
shall
be
expelled
without
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
and
in
order
to
fulfill
the
wishes
of
congress
in
101
(a)
(5)
(c),
you’ve
got
to
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
brennan,
let
me
say
this
in
regard
to
that.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
and
mr.
sherman
admits
it
in
his
brief,
have
ruled
that
in
order
to
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
support
the
charge.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
now
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir
because,
i
submit
it’s
not,
because
if
you’re
going
to
say
“look
and
see
if
there’s
some
evidence”
we’ve
got
to
interpret
the
charge
to
see
if
there’s
some
evidence,
otherwise
you’d
be
in
the
position
of
trying
to
decide
an
embezzlement
case
from
the
facts
without
looking
to
see
the
meaning
of
the
embezzlement
statute.
the
argument
--
the
issue
is
the
same
two
different
sides
of
the
same
coin
or
looking
through
the
same
window
from
opposite
sides.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
harlan
because
the
courts
of
course
have
more
training
in
this
type
of
thing.
the
use
of
words
in
interpreting
the
meaning
of
words
and
because
congress
gave
the
mandate
to
the
courts
in
title
29,
section
412
saying
that
“any
person
who’s
rights
are
infringed
upon
in
this
area
shall
have
recourse
in
the
federal
district
court.”
which
brings
us
to
the
second
area,
the
preemption
argument
which
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
things
about.
in
regard
to
the
preemption
issue
which
is
the
second
issue
that
this
comes
into
here.
we
have
to
understand
the
reason
for
preemption
is
that
what
the
courts
have
said
in
preemption
is
that
congress
has
carved
out
this
area
for
the
nlrb
to
operate
in,
and
therefore,
they
kept
the
state
courts
from
operating
in
that
sphere.
now,
in
this
area,
the
preemption
does
not
apply
because
congress
in
29412
says
“he
can
bring
a
civil
action
for
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.”
that
in
our
complaint
and
our
proof
showed
that
the
wrong
was
done
and
we
say
it
as
a
proximate
result
of
this
wrong,
this
man
lost
wages
for
this
time,
and
if
proximate
result
is
not
appropriate
relief,
there
can
be
no
appropriate
relief
because
that
appropriate
relief
is
a
little
looser
than
proximate
result
in
damages
and
proximate
cause
or
things
of
proximately
caused.
gentlemen,
i
--
this
is
an
important
case.
i
don’t
have
to
tell
you
that,
i
wouldn’t
be
here.
hardeman
is
a
man
--
his
problems
are
held
by
every
member
of
the
labor
movement
in
this
country.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
our
labor
law
is
to
protect
the
individual
rights
and
the
individual
working
man.
and
this
decision,
this
case,
as
long
as
it
stands,
will
protect
every
working
individual
in
the
united
states
from
such
wrongful
expulsion
as
hardeman
suffered.
and
i
think
it’s
necessary,
it’s
a
good
decision
and
on
behalf
of
mr.
hardeman,
my
client
and
on
behalf
of
the
members
of
the
labor
union
in
this
country,
i
hope
you’ll
affirm
the
decision
with
a
strong
opinion
to
protect
them
in
the
future.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don’t.
what
we
did,
we
presented
the
evidence
here
showing
that
hardeman
showed
his
income
tax
returns
that
he
made
so
much
before
his
expulsion,
and
then
afterwards,
we
showed
that
he
could
not
get
job
--
get
work
as
a
boilermaker,
or
even
though
he
made
every
effort
to.
and
then
we
showed
his
income
tax
return
showing
the
earnings
he
made
for
several
years
after
the
expulsion.
and
that
difference
then
showed,
he
was
a
man
who
was
43
years
of
age,
who
had
spent
his
life
acquiring
a
trade
as,
which
is
a
technical
trade,
just
like
my
trade
of
practicing
law
is
something
i
acquired,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
taken
away
from
me.
and
what
could
he
do
at
43,
go
out
and
he
wasn’t
able
to
adapt
to
find
something
of
equal
value
to
him.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
the
damage
just
were
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i’m
not
because
we’re
relying
on
the
act
for
giving
jurisdiction
to
the
court.
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
the
first
appearance
i’ve
made
before
this
honorable
court
and
i’d
like
to
say
that
it
is
an
honor
to
appear
here,
it’s
the
high
point
of
my
career.
this
case
is
here
on
two
issues
that
you
granted
certiorari
on,
the
issue
of
standard
of
review
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
and
the
issue
of
preemption.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
it
was
tried
in
mobile,
alabama
before
judge
daniel
thomas,
justice
black.
to
understand
the
standard
of
review,
i
might
recite
the
facts
as
chief
justice
burger
pointed
out.
the
union
trial
board
found
mr.
hardeman,
as
well
as
mr.
braswell,
because
we’re
also
reviewing
the
braswell
opinion
here,
guilty
of
two
charges.
article
xii,
section
1
and
article
xii,
section
1.
now,
what
they
had
done
in
affect
was
to
charge
them
with
those
two
charges.
the
trial
board
came
back
and
said
“we
find
you
guilty
as
charged.”
now,
we
came
into
court
alleging
in
our
complaint
that
we
have
been
denied
a
full
and
fair
hearing
because
the
evidence
did
not
support
a
finding
of
guilt
or
was
there
any
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
guilt
under
article
xiii,
section
1.
our
position
was
this
that
mr.
hardeman
as
well
as
mr.
braswell
were
in
the
same
position
as
a
man
on
trial
in
a
criminal
case
with
the
two-count
indictment.
one
count
charging
him
with
a
simple
assault,
the
second
count
charging
him
with
rape.
there
being
evidence
of
a
simple
assault
but
no
evidence
of
any
sexual
contact,
but
the
jury
coming
in
and
finding
him
guilty
as
charged,
well
guilty
as
charged
necessarily
includes
the
rape
count.
and
that’s
what
happened
here.
now,
we
had
two
counts
or
two
charges
against
mr.
hardeman
and
mr.
braswell
in
this
case,
and
the
first
charge
was
xii
(1)
which
stated
that
through
the
use
of
force
of
violence
that
hardeman
tried
to
restrain
course
or
intimidate
an
official
of
the
brotherhood,
the
second
charge
incidentally
there
is
no
punishment
set
forth
there,
it’s
open,
apparently
can
be
--
punishment
can
be
administered
according
to
the
offense.
and
the
second
charge
was
article
xiii,
section
1
of
the
international
constitution
which
points
out
that
any
member
who
creates
dissention
among
the
members
or
who
seeks
to
create
a
dissolution
of
the
brotherhood,
or
a
division
of
funds.
in
essence,
it
describes
someone
who
is
trying
to
dissolve
the
union
as
an
organization,
and
that
article
says
that
anyone
who
is
guilty
of
this
will
be
suspended,
will
be
--
not
suspended
but
expelled
from
the
brotherhood.
now,
it
doesn’t
leave
any
question.
there’s
no
lesser
penalty.
it’s
just
like
a
state
statute
that
says
“if
you
commit
first
degree
murder,
you
will
be
sentenced
for
life
or
your
life
will
be
taken
from
you.”
and
that’s
what
article
xiii
does,
it's
a
much
more
serious
penalty.
now,
when
he
was
found
guilty,
when
these
men
were
found
guilty,
the
expulsion
vote
that
mr.
sherman
mentioned
was
really
superfluous.
they
didn’t
need
--
if
they
hadn’t
done
it
or
if
they
voted
not
to
expel
them,
they
would’ve
still
been
expelled
by
virtue
of
the
fact
they
were
found
guilty
under
article
xiii,
section
1.
now,
it
should
be
noted,
these
gentlemen
took
necessary
appeals
in
the
union,
and
in
doing
so,
they
were
necessarily
prejudiced
in
their
defense
because
they
had
to
presume
they
were
found
guilty
of
both,
and
so
by
doing
this,
they
had
to
be
found
guilty
of
both.
now
the
trial
judge
doesn’t
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
do
think
it
would’ve
been
different.
if
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
i
think
this.
if
they
had
found
the
member
is
guilty
of
article
xii,
section
1,
they
could’ve
said
“for
a
penalty,
we
will
fine
you
$100.00
each
or
we
will
suspend
you
for
six
months”,
and/or
they
could’ve
said
“for
a
penalty,
we
will
leave
it
up
to
a
vote
of
the
brotherhood.”
and
when
it
came
before
the
brotherhood,
when
they
--
a
motion
for
expulsion
was
offered,
the
brotherhood
would’ve
said
“well,
no.
let’s
vote
against
this
because
it’s
too
harsh.”
as
it
was,
when
the
motion
for
expulsion
was
offered,
the
brotherhood
knew
they
had
been
found
guilty
of
a
section
demanding
expulsion,
so
why
not
go
ahead
and
vote
for
it.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
it’s
not.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
it
would
not
be
dissention
within
the
meaning
of
article
xiii
(1).
to
say
it
would,
would
be
if
you’d
be
guilty
of
dissention
under
xiii
(1)
in
doing
that,
well
then
you
could
also
say
that
someone
who
is
presumptive
enough
to
when
election
comes
around
to
run
against
the
business
agent
in
the
election
to
run
for
his
job.
now,
this
man
is
certainly
creating
more
dissention
in
the
union
and
causing
a
division
of
difference
of
opinion
there.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
my
understanding
of
course,
this
is
not
--
was
not
made
an
issue
of
the
case.
but
my
understanding
is
that
among
the
boilermakers
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
business
agent
to
be
punched.
now,
of
course
to
us
this
is
shocking,
because
we
don’t
carry
on
business
in
that
way,
but
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
but,
nonetheless,
the
members
could’ve
taken
if
they
found
them
guilty
only
on
the
article
xii
and
it
were
up
to
the
members
to
decide
the
punishment,
they
could
have
found
--
decided
a
punishment
that
would’ve
been
consistent
with
the
offense
in
the
context
of
the
way
they
carry
it
on
business.
but
having
found
him
guilty
under
xiii
(1),
then
they
had
no
choice
but
to
vote
for
expulsion
because
the
men
were
expelled
anyway
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
they
were
found
guilty,
the
constitution
demanded
it.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
but
i
do
not
think
that’s
of
course,
that
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
case
either,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well,
sir
that
was
not
within
the
procedure
of
the
union
remedies.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
i
did
not
notice
that
mr.
justice
white,
but
apparently
it
is.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
let
me
say
this
in
regard
to
that
standard
of
review.
the
standard
of
review
is
set
forth
by
congress
in
section
101
(a)
(5)
or
section
--
or
29
u.s.c.,
411
(5)
(c)
as
requiring
that
the
members
had
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
now,
all
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
admit
this
in
their
brief,
have
held
that
in
order
to
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
support
the
charge.
now
we
contended
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
not
some
evidence
to
support
the
charge.
and
their
brief
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
some
evidence
particularly
as
to
article
xiii,
section
1,
because
that
is
a
fair
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
automatic
expulsion.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
charge
is
that
he
created
dissention
among
the
membership
to
create
a
division
of
funds.
it’s
on
page
63
of
the
appendix.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
of
the
international
brotherhood,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
what
you
have
stated,
may
i
mr.
justice
black,
let
me
go
further.
what
you
have
stated
was
part
of
the
charge.
that
was
the
particular,
really
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
in
doing
that,
they
said
that
this
act
itself
is
a
violation
of
section
13
(1)
which
carries
with
it
an
automatic
expulsion.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
because
this
was
a
personal
thing
between
mr.
hardeman
and
the
business
agent
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
wasn’t
a
blow
aimed
at
dissolving
the
union.hardeman’s
motivation
was
not
to
attack
the
union
as
an
organizational
structure.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
i
submit
its
not,
because
i
submit
in
interpreting
this
section,
you
cannot
stop
right
there,
because
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
because
that
is
a
personal
thing
and
this
prohibits
an
attack
against
the
organization
itself,
the
organizational
structure.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
the
top
authority
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
white,
the
trial
was
in
the
lodge,
the
local
lodge,
and
appeal
went
to
the
executive
council
of
the
international.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
and
then
to
the
executive
president.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
i
don’t
think
that
is
the
case.
as
i
recall,
what
was
submitted
to
the
lodge
was
not
to
determine.
they
didn’t
--
the
lodge
did
not
hear
the
evidence
or
review
the
transcript.
all
that
was
submitted
to
the
lodge
was
a
motion
that
to
the
effect
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
pardon
me
sir,
you’re
in
the
appendix,
page
56.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
on
the
basis
that
at
a
meeting
a
motion
was
offered
to
the
membership
saying
“we
have
found
--
the
trial
board
has
heard
the
evidence,
and
having
heard
the
evidence,
they
find
him
guilty.
we
move
that
finding
of
the
trial
board
be
accepted.”
now
that
was
done
at
the
local
meeting
without
hearing
the
evidence
or
anything.
see,
that
was
still
on
the
local
lodge
level.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
only
thing,
mr.
justice
white,
the
only
thing
they
knew
about
was
discussion
among
around
the
hall.
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
it
does.
i
think
it
shows
that
a
motion
was
offered.
it
certainly
does
not
show
that
any
evidence
or
any
research
of
the
transcript
was
taken,
because
what
happened
in
this
case
was,
the
appeal
was
made
to
the
executive
council
who
held
a
trial
de
novo
and
retried
the
issues.
the
executive
council
being
appointed,
the
executive
council
of
the
international
union,
and
then
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
they
held
the
same
thing
as
the
guilty
as
charged
in
accepting
the
finding
of
the
trial
board.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
then,
to
further
exhaust
their
remedies,
they
took
an
appeal
to
the
international
president
of
the
union.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
he
examined
the
transcript
of
the
executive
council
hearing
and
of
the
local
lodge
hearing.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
he
reached
the
same
conclusion
not
to
disturb
the
finding.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that
was
the
end
of
it
as
far
as
the
whole
union
was
concerned.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
reason
he
did
not
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well,
the
reason
for
it,
mr.
justice
black
was
because
of
a
real
solution.
this
particular
boilermaker
was
in
the
construction
trade
and
as
he
expressed
it
to
get
back
into
the
union
forcibly
was
no
solution,
because
on
construction
jobs,
it
was
not
uncommon
that
accidents
happen
and
people
were
hurt
or
killed.
and
that
this
was
a
rough
group
and
he
feared
that
if
they
were
forced
to
take
him
back
that
his
days
might
be
numbered.
now
further
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
he
can
get
damages
under
section
412.
title
29,
section
412
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
which
says
that
any
person
who’s
rights
secured
by
the
--
any
provision
of
the
chapter
may
bring
a
civil
action,
which
is
commonly
construed
to
mean
all
the
damages,
or
anything
not
criminal
or
admiralty
there
for
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.
now,
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir,
that’s
what
the
act
says.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir.
this
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
the
whole
heart
of
this
damage
suit
is
that
the
complaint
says
that
we
were
improperly
expelled
because
we
did
not
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
and
therefore,
we
are
seeking
damages,
the
approximate
damages.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
we
had
a
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
we
did
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir
we
did,
and
i’m
sorry
i
misunderstood
you
justice
black.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that,
mr.
justice
black,
the
two
charges
was
the
basis
of
our
--
him
being
found
guilty
of
a
charge
for
which
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
him,
was
the
basis
of
our
theory
that
our
evidence
in
court
that
he
did
not
--
was
not
given
a
full
and
fair
hearing
because
he
was
at
same
position
as
a
man
on
trial
under
two-count
indictment
and
one
count
the
evidence
conformed
into
one
count
but
not
conformed
to
the
other.
the
jury
came
back
in
saying
“we
find
him
guilty
as
charged.”
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
because
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
the
point
here
mr.
justice
burger
is
that
if
he’s
guilty
of
one,
you’re
saying
here
is
that
he
could
get
the
same
punishment
under
both
charges.
but
on
the
other
hand
too,
he
could
get
a
lesser
punishment
under
the
charge
if
he
weren’t
found
guilty
of
the
charge
for
which
there
was
no
evidence.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
that’s
true,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
all
of
the
transcript
and
the
evidence
that
was
taken
on
this
matter.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
it
should
be
the
plain
meaning
of
the
particular
charge
because
included
in
section
101
(a)
(5)
(b)is
a
requirement
that
the
member
be
given
specific
charges.
now,
if
congress
is
going
to
demand
that
he
be
given
specific
charges,
they
ought
to
demand
specific
proof.
it
would
not
be
a
fair
hearing.
there
are
many
things
as
to
questions
of
full
and
fair
hearing
is
a
broad
term.
but
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun,
when
you
read
the
article
together
in
its
context,
it
becomes
obvious
of
course,
maybe
it
doesn’t,
but
it
becomes
obvious
to
me
and
apparently
to
the
justices
who
have
reviewed
this
that
this
article
prohibits
some
attack
against
the
organizational
structure
itself.
and
that
we’re
not
saying
here
that
hardeman
should
not
have
been
disciplined.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
the
court
should
decide
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
a
particular
section.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
congress
has
issued
a
mandate
that
the
court
do
it,
because
congress
has
said
that
no
member
shall
be
expelled
without
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
and
in
order
to
fulfill
the
wishes
of
congress
in
101
(a)
(5)
(c),
you’ve
got
to
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
brennan,
let
me
say
this
in
regard
to
that.
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
and
mr.
sherman
admits
it
in
his
brief,
have
ruled
that
in
order
to
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
there
must
be
some
evidence
to
support
the
charge.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
now
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir
because,
i
submit
it’s
not,
because
if
you’re
going
to
say
“look
and
see
if
there’s
some
evidence”
we’ve
got
to
interpret
the
charge
to
see
if
there’s
some
evidence,
otherwise
you’d
be
in
the
position
of
trying
to
decide
an
embezzlement
case
from
the
facts
without
looking
to
see
the
meaning
of
the
embezzlement
statute.
the
argument
--
the
issue
is
the
same
two
different
sides
of
the
same
coin
or
looking
through
the
same
window
from
opposite
sides.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
harlan
because
the
courts
of
course
have
more
training
in
this
type
of
thing.
the
use
of
words
in
interpreting
the
meaning
of
words
and
because
congress
gave
the
mandate
to
the
courts
in
title
29,
section
412
saying
that
“any
person
who’s
rights
are
infringed
upon
in
this
area
shall
have
recourse
in
the
federal
district
court.”
which
brings
us
to
the
second
area,
the
preemption
argument
which
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
things
about.
in
regard
to
the
preemption
issue
which
is
the
second
issue
that
this
comes
into
here.
we
have
to
understand
the
reason
for
preemption
is
that
what
the
courts
have
said
in
preemption
is
that
congress
has
carved
out
this
area
for
the
nlrb
to
operate
in,
and
therefore,
they
kept
the
state
courts
from
operating
in
that
sphere.
now,
in
this
area,
the
preemption
does
not
apply
because
congress
in
29412
says
“he
can
bring
a
civil
action
for
such
relief
as
maybe
appropriate.”
that
in
our
complaint
and
our
proof
showed
that
the
wrong
was
done
and
we
say
it
as
a
proximate
result
of
this
wrong,
this
man
lost
wages
for
this
time,
and
if
proximate
result
is
not
appropriate
relief,
there
can
be
no
appropriate
relief
because
that
appropriate
relief
is
a
little
looser
than
proximate
result
in
damages
and
proximate
cause
or
things
of
proximately
caused.
gentlemen,
i
--
this
is
an
important
case.
i
don’t
have
to
tell
you
that,
i
wouldn’t
be
here.
hardeman
is
a
man
--
his
problems
are
held
by
every
member
of
the
labor
movement
in
this
country.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
our
labor
law
is
to
protect
the
individual
rights
and
the
individual
working
man.
and
this
decision,
this
case,
as
long
as
it
stands,
will
protect
every
working
individual
in
the
united
states
from
such
wrongful
expulsion
as
hardeman
suffered.
and
i
think
it’s
necessary,
it’s
a
good
decision
and
on
behalf
of
mr.
hardeman,
my
client
and
on
behalf
of
the
members
of
the
labor
union
in
this
country,
i
hope
you’ll
affirm
the
decision
with
a
strong
opinion
to
protect
them
in
the
future.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don’t.
what
we
did,
we
presented
the
evidence
here
showing
that
hardeman
showed
his
income
tax
returns
that
he
made
so
much
before
his
expulsion,
and
then
afterwards,
we
showed
that
he
could
not
get
job
--
get
work
as
a
boilermaker,
or
even
though
he
made
every
effort
to.
and
then
we
showed
his
income
tax
return
showing
the
earnings
he
made
for
several
years
after
the
expulsion.
and
that
difference
then
showed,
he
was
a
man
who
was
43
years
of
age,
who
had
spent
his
life
acquiring
a
trade
as,
which
is
a
technical
trade,
just
like
my
trade
of
practicing
law
is
something
i
acquired,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
taken
away
from
me.
and
what
could
he
do
at
43,
go
out
and
he
wasn’t
able
to
adapt
to
find
something
of
equal
value
to
him.
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
the
damage
just
were
--
mr.
robert
e.
mcdonald,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i’m
not
because
we’re
relying
on
the
act
for
giving
jurisdiction
to
the
court.
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
