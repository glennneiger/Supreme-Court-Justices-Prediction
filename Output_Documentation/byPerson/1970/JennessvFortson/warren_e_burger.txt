the

wouldn’t
need
anything
like
80,000
signatures
on

would

chief

e.

your
answer
to
justice

would
be
what
that
which
is

easier?
chief

what
was
the
total
cast
in

primary?
chief

e.

you
mean
in

chief

is
this
true
of
statewide
elections

chief

by

do
you

chief

e.

well,
i
suppose,
at
least
i
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
some
of
the
very
significant
political
expression
in
this
country
has
been
by
young
people
and
others
not
so
young
who
were
pure
volunteers
who
would
do
these
things
if
they
had
a
belief,
if
they
had
a
conviction
about
that
particular
issue
or
party.
now
in
terms
of
collecting
whether
it’s
10,000
names
or
5,000
names,
isn’t
that
entirely
possible
of
purely
voluntary
efforts,
if
in
fact
there
is
a
significant
support
for
the
views
that
either
that
party
or
that
candidate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
spoke
earlier
i
think
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
you
referred
to
a
compelling
state
interest
and
related
that
to
frivolous
candidates.
now
did
that
--
did
you
mean
by
that
the
candidate
who
is
frivolous
because
of
his
person
or
his
views,
or
a
candidate
who
is
frivolous
in
the
sense
that
he
never
could
get
more
than
a
minimal
support?
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
castellani?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
castellani,
in
you
recital
of
possible
interests
of
the
state,
you
did
not
mention
that
one,
sometimes
included,
the
possible
fraud
on
the
voters.
i’m
thinking
of
a
case
in
state
of
nebraska
some
years
ago,
when
senator
george
norris
was
up
for
reelection
and
there
was
a
great
effort
to
defeat
him,
which
i
think
as
i
recall
the
history,
succeeded.
and
one
of
the
mechanisms
was
to
find
the
man
with
the
name
of
george
norris
and
put
him
on
the
ballot
to
obviously
to
divide
the
vote.
is
that
whether
we
call
it
compelling
or
not,
is
that
a
legitimate
state
interest
to
have
some
limitation
whether
it’s
5%
or
10
or
15
or
3?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
suspend
now
and
let
you
begin
right
after
lunch
mr.
rindskopf.
mr.
rindskopf,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you’re
speaking
now
of
the
general
election.
that
could
be
on
the
general
election
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
care
to
comment
on
the
state’s
interest
in
terms
of
preventing
fraud
on
the
voters
by
use
the
same
or
similar
names
of
candidates?
chief

isn’t
it?
