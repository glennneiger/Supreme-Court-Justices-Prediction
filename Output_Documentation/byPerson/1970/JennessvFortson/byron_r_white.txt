well,
i
take
it
then
mr.
rindskopf,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
percentage
was
1%
or
a
half
a
percent.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
isn’t
the
reasonableness.
that’s
all
it
is.
if
you
for
example
suggested
that
perhaps
the
state
would
have
a
compelling
interest
in
requiring
1%,
then
it
does
come
down
to
a
judgment
as
to
how
much
that
is
worth,
and
maybe
the
state
judgments
were
something
--

wouldn’t
you
argue
that
it’s

that
there
couldn’t

a

justice
byron

well,
why
isn’t
it
worth
5%?
