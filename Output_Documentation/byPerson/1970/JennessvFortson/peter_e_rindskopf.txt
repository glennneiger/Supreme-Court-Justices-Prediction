mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court
pursuant
to
28
united
states
code,
section
1253.
that
court
denied
the
appellant’s
motion
for
preliminary
and
permanent
injunction
against
the
application
and
enforcement
execution
of
georgia
code
annotated
section
34-1010.
section
34
of
the
georgia
code
is
the
georgia
election
code,
and
i
think
for
convenience
sake,
i
will
just
refer
to
the
individual
sections
as
for
example,
section
1010.
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party,
candidates
for
governor
and
for
two
of
the
congressional
districts
in
the
state
of
georgia.
voters
who
desire
to
support
them
and
the
class
of
persons
who
desire
an
opportunity
to
consider
persons
on
the
ballot
other
than
democrats
and
republicans.
section
1010
of
the
georgia
election
code
provides
simply
that
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot,
unless
you
come
within
stated
exceptions,
you
must
secure
the
signatures
of
5%
of
the
voters
who
were
registered
to
vote
for
the
office
which
you
see
at
the
last
time,
it
was
previously
offered
for
election.
it
is
a
straight
5%
of
the
registered
elector.
in
the
case
of
the
lead
appellant,
mrs.
jenness,
the
candidate
for
governor
of
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party,
5%
of
the
number
of
the
registered
voters
of
the
last
time
the
office
she
sought
would
come
out
to
be
some
88,175
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
do
not
have
any
distribution
problem
except
insofar
as
for
example
in
a
congressional
candidate,
the
signatures
must
come
from
persons
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
--
in
the
district.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct,
anywhere
in
the
state.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
they
could
have
all
come
from
fulton
county,
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
two
districts
with
which
we
are
concerned,
which
are
the
congressional
districts
which
to
divide
the
city
of
atlanta,
the
fourth
and
fifth,
the
numbers
were
10,000
and
11,000.
and
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct.
15%
of
the
vote
cast.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
as
we
have
attempted
--
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
at
page
8
and
page
9,
in
georgia,
the
number
of
voters
is
generally
about
50%
of
the
number
of
registered
voters,
or
it
has
been
in
the
last
two
gubernatorial
elections.
so
the
5%
total
here
actually
works
out
to
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
10%
of
the
votes
cast.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
write-ins
are
permissible.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
the
5%
here
comes
out
to
slightly
less
than
the
15%
in
ohio.
it
comes
out
to
about
10%
by
the
ohio
standard.
so
georgia’s
requirement
is
some
percentage
points
easier,
in
terms
of
numbers
than
ohio’s.
i
might
add
that
since
that
time,
ohio
has
changed
its
laws,
reduced
its
percentages
and
in
a
three-judge
federal
court
decision
this
summer,
those
reduced
percentages
were
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
think
that’s
certainly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
first
time
the
case
was
here,
i’m
not
so
certain
that
it
was
correct
when
it
was
back
in
ohio.
they
were
dealing
with
a
number
of
the
laws
which
this
court
had
already
struck
down.
and
it
seems
that
they
were
pretty
well
able
to
isolate
out
the
number
of
signatures
required
and
strike
that
down
on
its
own
rather
than
as
part
of
an
entangling
web,
as
the
court
has
said.
when
i
say
that
the
candidates
here
are
candidates
of
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party,
i
should
point
out
that
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party
is
a
political
body
according
to
the
laws
of
georgia
which
means
two
things.
it
means
first
that
its
candidates
failed
to
receive
20%
of
the
votes,
the
last
time
the
office
of
governor
was
contested.
and
it
means
that
its
candidates
failed
to
receive
20%
of
the
nationwide
vote
for
president.
but
it
also
means
one
more
thing.
it
means
that
the
party
is
registered
with
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
pursuant
to
section
901
of
the
election
code,
which
basically
requires
the
party
to
go
through
the
same
procedures
that
a
corporation
would
to
register.
it
has
to
file
its
bylaws,
submit
the
names
of
its
officers
and
any
other
information,
the
secretary
may
in
fact
desire.
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party
has
complied
with
this
requirement.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
it
is
and
it
is
not
your
honor.
the
republicans
of
course
have
been
on
the
ballot
by
petition
at
the
last
gubernatorial
election
before
this
one.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
he
received
the
plurality.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
callaway,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
also
pursuant
to
the
georgia
election
code,
the
candidates
of
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party
were
nominated
by
the
party
to
be
its
candidates
for
office
in
a
convention
of
the
party.
and
a
certification
of
their
nomination
was
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state.
so
we
don’t
have
here
exactly
the
case
of
completely
independent
candidates.
the
nominees
of
the
party
here
have
had
to
go
through
at
least
one
hurdle
before
they
get
to
the
problem
of
gathering
signatures.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
party
candidates
in
georgia
belonging
to
the
party
which
collected
20%
of
the
vote
for
governor
or
president
need
not
gather
any
signatures
at
all,
nor
need
their
party
in
its
primary
secure
any
definite
number
of
votes
before
they
can
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
final
election.
and
in
fact,
in
the
instant
case,
the
number
of
signatures
which
mrs.
jenness
would
have
been
required
to
secure,
exceeded
the
number
of
votes
that
were
actually
cast
in
the
republican
primary
for
the
winner
of
that
primary.
he
got
some
62,000
votes.
mrs.
jenness
would’ve
had
to
get
some
88,000
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
just
over
a
hundred
thousand,
your
honor.
so
it
was
slightly
in
excess
of
the
signature
requirement
that
she
was
required
to
meet.
but
there
is
absolutely
no
requirement
once
a
party
qualifies
as
a
party
that
it
in
its
primary
before
it
put
its
candidates
on
the
ballot
at
the
final
election
show
any
scintilla
of
voter
interest
in
the
party.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
at
the
last
previous
election.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
up
until
very
recently
of
course,
georgia
was
strictly
a
one
party
stand.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
no
question.
i
might
add
that
the
20%
requirement
came
in
for
the
first
time
in
1964.
prior
to
that
time
to
be
a
party
and
be
on
the
ballot
regularly,
going
back
to
1943,
all
you
needed
was
to
retain
5%
of
the
vote
at
previous
elections.
before
1943,
going
back
to
the
georgia
code
of
1922,
anybody
could
be
a
candidate
who
registered
himself
as
such
with
the
secretary
of
state.
there
was
no
requirement
that
his
party
secure
any
certain
number
of
votes,
nor
was
there
any
requirement
that
he
himself
get
a
petition
with
any
number
of
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
of
course
i
would
want
to
argue
that
you
don’t
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
we
think
the
5%
is
a
restriction
on
freedom
of
speech.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
terms
of
what’s
required
in
the
other
states,
or
the
vast
majority
of
those
other
states
require
1%
or
less.
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
the
reason
that
the
state
can
come
up
with
for
this
requirement,
it
seems
to
me
that
really
it’s
only
justification
would
possibly
be
to
protect
the
ballot
against
purely
frivolous
candidates.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
yes
it
would,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would.
unless
of
course
the
state
could
show
some
sort
of
danger
which
would
accrue
from
unlimited
numbers
of
candidates
getting
on
the
ballot.
i
don’t
think
that
based
on
what
the
court
said
about
the
ohio
case
or
based
upon
what
the
state
said
below
here
that
there
is
any
sort
of
conceivable
danger.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
all
right.
the
implication
of
that
it
seems
to
me
is
exactly
the
same
implication
that
the
recent
three-judge-court
in
ohio
in
the
decision
in
318
of
the
federal
supplement,
found
that
when
ohio
jumped
its
requirement
from
1%
to
7%,
and
later
back
to
4%,
the
state
had
to
show
some
sort
of
compelling
interest
for
that
increase.
ohio
was
unable
to
show
any
compelling
interest
for
that
increase,
similarly
in
georgia.
we
would
say
that
there
has
never
been
any
showing
by
state
that
the
increase
from
no
signature
requirement
to
5%
of
the
registered
voters
has
been
show.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
5%
requirement
was
adopted
completely
arbitrarily
in
1943,
it
was
continued
again
in
1964,
but
there’s
never
been
any
showing.
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
difficult
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
really
could
not
say.
it’s
not
like
the
situation
in
ohio
where
henry
wallace
received
enough
votes
as
to
cast
some
sort
of
doubt
about
the
result
of
the
election,
because
in
georgia,
going
back
to
1872,
every
time
there
has
been
a
statewide
race,
the
democrats
have
carried.
so,
it
strikes
me
that
it
was
a
revision
of
the
election
code,
and
while
they
were
revising
it,
someone
said
“well,
we
should
put
in
some
sort
of
a
requirement.”
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
any
reason
for
the
change
from
0%
to
5%.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no
it’s
just
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
it’s
just
as
it
was
in
ohio.
there
was
no
state
restriction
on
doing
first
amendment
kinds
of
things.
the
restriction
is
on
getting
on
the
ballot.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
making
speech
and
having
meetings
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
certainly.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
that
such
a
restriction
would
easily
fall
and
we
don’t
have
that
here.
there
is
one
specific
problem
with
the
write-in
vote
in
georgia
which
may
not
be
present
in
other
states.
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
direction
in
the
election
code
which
requires
write-in
votes
to
be
counted
by
the
people
counting
the
votes
exactly
as
they
are
written,
so
that
if
there
were
a
write-in
vote
for
linda
jenness,
and
another
for
mrs.
linda
jenness,
those
two
votes
would
be
counted
separately
and
however
many
write-in
votes
went
down
under
the
one
column
or
under
some
wrong
spelling
would
be
counted
separately,
there
would
be
no
accumulation
of
the
votes.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
they
count
write-in
votes,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
there’s
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
don’t
know
of
any
recent
example
of
a
write-in
ballot
or
being
elected
to
governor
in
georgia.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
it’s
conceivable.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
showing
in
the
record
as
to
whether
it
is
ever
happened.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
in
georgia.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
certainly
it
has
happened.
another
restriction
on
the
signature
gathering
that
takes
place
in
georgia
is
the
requirement
that
signatures
be
gathered
by
a
person
who
is
eligible
to
vote
for
the
office
that
is
being
sought.
for
example,
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
congressional
districts
which
divide
the
city
of
atlanta,
the
socialist
workers
party
could
not
gather
signatures
in
the
fifth
district
with
a
member
of
its
party
who
was
in
fact
registered
in
the
fourth
district.
and
this
i
think
is
an
impairment.
on
the
signature
gathering
requirement,
it
makes
it
i
think,
somewhat
more
difficult
than
it
appears
on
its
face.
it
means
that
unless
the
party
is
distributed
equally
among
congressional
districts,
its
chances
of
gathering
signatures
in
one
district
or
the
other
depends
not
on
the
membership
of
the
party,
but
on
where
the
members
of
that
party
live.
and
possibly
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well
of
course
in
the
statewide
election
anyone
living
anywhere
in
the
state
would
be
eligible
to
vote.
two
of
the
appellants
here
of
course
sought
congressional
districts.
they
were
not
running
for
at
large
congressional
seats,
they
were
running
for
specific
geographic
districts.
a
major
problem
it
seems
to
me
along
the
first
amendment
lines
is
in
the
problem
of
one’s
fcc
privileges
whether
one
can
get
free
or
equal
time,
if
one
is
only
a
write-in
candidate
or
if
one
is
a
candidate
who
is
duly
qualified.
fcc
or
at
least
the
television
stations
in
georgia
have
permitted
people
who
are
registered
with
the
secretary
of
state
as
write-in
candidates
to
enjoy
equal
time.
they
have
not
permitted
persons
who
are
not
registered
as
write-in
candidates
and
who
do
not
meet
the
signature
requirement
to
have
that
equal
time.
so
to
that
extent,
a
failure
to
either
register
yourself
as
a
write-in
candidate
or
to
appear
either
to
register
yourself
as
a
write-in
candidate
or
to
secure
the
signatures
is
in
fact
a
limitation
on
your
ability
to
appear
before
the
public.
in
terms
of
the
candidates
here,
the
record
has
their
affidavits
as
to
poverty,
their
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
in
fact
in
this
court.
the
record
also
contains
stipulation
of
the
parties
as
to
the
expense
that
was
incurred
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
checking
the
signatures
that
were
gathered
by
mr.
callaway
and
by
mr.
wallace
when
they
successfully
met
the
petition
requirements.
and
those
figures
are
some
$77,000.00
and
$81,000.00,
by
the
secretary
of
state
just
to
verify
the
signatures
which
were
gathered.
there
was
no
actual
showing
in
the
record
as
to
how
much
it
cost
to
gather
those
signatures,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
highly
reasonable
speculation
that
it
certainly
cost
at
least
that
amount
to
go
out
and
physically
gather
those
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
we
successfully
challenge
that
in
the
lower
court,
the
state
has
not
appealed.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
so,
if
they
were
able
to
get
their
signatures
and
show
poverty,
they
could
go
on
the
ballot
without
paying
a
fee.
i
think
the
argument
that
the
state
has
made
here
is
illustrative
of
the
fact
that
the
state
really
has
no
compelling
interest
in
this
requirement.
the
state
for
example
has
said
in
its
brief
that
georgia
does
not
have
very
restrictive
laws,
and
it
points
to
some
examples
of
other
states
with
more
restrictive
laws.
for
example,
states
where
if
you
have
voted
in
a
party
primary,
you
can
not
then
come
along
and
sign
and
petition
for
an
independent
or
a
nonpolitical
party
candidate.
it’s
quite
true
that
in
georgia,
anybody
as
long
as
he
is
a
registered
voter
can
sign
a
petition.
it
doesn’t
matter
if
he
intends
to
go
out
and
vote
in
the
democratic
or
the
republican
primary
the
next
day.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
very
freeness
that
georgia
offers
indicates
that
it
really
doesn’t
have
any
real
purpose
in
imposing
the
signature
requirement.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
i
certainly
don’t
have
to
make
that
argument
in
terms
of
reasonableness,
because
of
course
it
is
here
5%.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
would
think
your
honor,
subject
to
the
qualification
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
impose
some
sort
of
non-frivolous
barrier.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
non-frivolous.
i
think
they
might
well
be
able
to
protect
the
ballot
against
completely
frivolous
candidates.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
would
think
it
might
well
be.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
how
can
you
weigh
these
things?
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
i
think
to
go
to
as
much
as
5%
or
10%
of
the
actual
votes
becomes
unduly
burdensome.
it
becomes,
in
actual
terms,
an
impossibility
for
people
who
do
not
have
some
large
support.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
mean
both
money
mr.
chief
justice,
and
people
who
are
members
of
their
party
or
who
might
be
able
to
go
out
and
gather
signatures
for
them
to
say
nothing
of
people
who
might
be
willing
to
sign
on
their
behalf.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
views
will
be
very
unpopular
ones,
such
as
socialism
in
the
state
of
georgia.
i
take
the
fact
that
the
views
may
not
attract
a
large
number
of
adherence
is
not
really
the
determining
factor.
or
turning
to
the
young
people
for
example,
if
in
fact
they
were
not
registered
to
vote
in
georgia,
they
would
not
be
eligible
to
either
collect
signatures
or
to
sign
the
petitions
themselves.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
think
of
the
frivolous
candidate
is
someone
who
qualifies
for
office
just
because
he
wants
to
see
his
name
on
the
ballot.
it
may
well
be
that
even
he
has
first
amendment
rights
which
would
be
infringed
by
any
such
signature
requirement.
but
in
the
instant
case,
they
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
organizing
themselves
as
a
political
body
according
to
georgia
law.
they
have
filed
papers
with
the
secretary
of
state.
they
have
paid
him
a
minimum
fee
for
filing
those
papers.
i
think
they’ve
gone
far
beyond
any
sort
of
frivolous
question.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
just
have
the
briefest
of
points,
your
honors.
first
one
when
my
opponent
says
that
the
1943
laws
were
less
restrictive
than
the
1922
laws,
he
is
just
plain
incorrect.
in
1922
and
the
election
code
found
in
the
1922
session
laws
at
page
100,
it
states
very
clearly
that
the
names
of
candidates
of
each
political
party
and
also
the
names
of
any
other
candidates
for
the
offices
to
be
filled
are
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
and
it
further
provides
that
all
candidates
for
national
and
state
offices
or
the
proper
authorities
of
the
political
party
nominating
them
shall
file
notice
of
their
candidacy,
giving
their
names
in
the
offices
for
which
they
are
candidates
with
the
secretary
of
state.
so
the
1943
move
from
no
petition
requirements
to
5%
was
in
fact
more
restrictive
up
until
that
time
anyone
could
get
on
the
ballot
simply
by
filing
a
notice
of
candidacy
with
the
secretary
of
state.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
in
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
the
law
says
“in
all
elections
other
than
primaries
conducted
by
a
political
party,
it
shall
be
the
duty
to
place
on
the
ballot
the
names
of
party
nominees
and
all
others
who
have
indicated
their
wish
to
be
candidates.”
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
yes
i
do.
i
think
the
state
is
adequately
protected
here
in
at
least
two
ways.
first,
the
closing
date
for
petition
requirements
is
the
same
date
as
the
closing
date
for
nominees
who
wish
to
enter
into
a
party
primary,
so
that
you
can
not
come
along
after
the
party
primary
and
file
a
notice
of
independent
candidacy,
unless
it’s
a
forgoing
conclusion
who’s
going
to
win
the
primary,
the
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
sometimes.
well,
i
think
the
election
spirit
in
georgia
is
in
a
little
more
rough
and
tumbled
than
that.
it’s
probably
safe
to
say
it’s
a
forgoing
conclusion
that
the
party
nominee
is
going
to
win.
but
there
in
the
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
the
democratic
party
nominee
usually
wins
the
election.
but
there
is
a
second
restriction
which
the
state
has
and
legitimately,
and
that
is
that
party
nominees
appear
on
the
ballot
along
with
a
party
designation
such
as
lester
maddox
democrat,
an
independent
nominee
wishing
to
put
a
fraud
upon
the
voters
by
appearing
under
the
same
name
would
not
have
that
party
designation.
it
seems
to
me
that’s
a
clear
way
of
preventing
what
happened
to
mr.
norris
in
ohio.
those
would
be
our
points
and
we
would
have
nothing
further.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court
pursuant
to
28
united
states
code,
section
1253.
that
court
denied
the
appellant’s
motion
for
preliminary
and
permanent
injunction
against
the
application
and
enforcement
execution
of
georgia
code
annotated
section
34-1010.
section
34
of
the
georgia
code
is
the
georgia
election
code,
and
i
think
for
convenience
sake,
i
will
just
refer
to
the
individual
sections
as
for
example,
section
1010.
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party,
candidates
for
governor
and
for
two
of
the
congressional
districts
in
the
state
of
georgia.
voters
who
desire
to
support
them
and
the
class
of
persons
who
desire
an
opportunity
to
consider
persons
on
the
ballot
other
than
democrats
and
republicans.
section
1010
of
the
georgia
election
code
provides
simply
that
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot,
unless
you
come
within
stated
exceptions,
you
must
secure
the
signatures
of
5%
of
the
voters
who
were
registered
to
vote
for
the
office
which
you
see
at
the
last
time,
it
was
previously
offered
for
election.
it
is
a
straight
5%
of
the
registered
elector.
in
the
case
of
the
lead
appellant,
mrs.
jenness,
the
candidate
for
governor
of
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party,
5%
of
the
number
of
the
registered
voters
of
the
last
time
the
office
she
sought
would
come
out
to
be
some
88,175
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
do
not
have
any
distribution
problem
except
insofar
as
for
example
in
a
congressional
candidate,
the
signatures
must
come
from
persons
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
--
in
the
district.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct,
anywhere
in
the
state.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
they
could
have
all
come
from
fulton
county,
that’s
correct.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
two
districts
with
which
we
are
concerned,
which
are
the
congressional
districts
which
to
divide
the
city
of
atlanta,
the
fourth
and
fifth,
the
numbers
were
10,000
and
11,000.
and
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct.
15%
of
the
vote
cast.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
as
we
have
attempted
--
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
at
page
8
and
page
9,
in
georgia,
the
number
of
voters
is
generally
about
50%
of
the
number
of
registered
voters,
or
it
has
been
in
the
last
two
gubernatorial
elections.
so
the
5%
total
here
actually
works
out
to
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
10%
of
the
votes
cast.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
write-ins
are
permissible.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
the
5%
here
comes
out
to
slightly
less
than
the
15%
in
ohio.
it
comes
out
to
about
10%
by
the
ohio
standard.
so
georgia’s
requirement
is
some
percentage
points
easier,
in
terms
of
numbers
than
ohio’s.
i
might
add
that
since
that
time,
ohio
has
changed
its
laws,
reduced
its
percentages
and
in
a
three-judge
federal
court
decision
this
summer,
those
reduced
percentages
were
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
think
that’s
certainly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
first
time
the
case
was
here,
i’m
not
so
certain
that
it
was
correct
when
it
was
back
in
ohio.
they
were
dealing
with
a
number
of
the
laws
which
this
court
had
already
struck
down.
and
it
seems
that
they
were
pretty
well
able
to
isolate
out
the
number
of
signatures
required
and
strike
that
down
on
its
own
rather
than
as
part
of
an
entangling
web,
as
the
court
has
said.
when
i
say
that
the
candidates
here
are
candidates
of
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party,
i
should
point
out
that
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party
is
a
political
body
according
to
the
laws
of
georgia
which
means
two
things.
it
means
first
that
its
candidates
failed
to
receive
20%
of
the
votes,
the
last
time
the
office
of
governor
was
contested.
and
it
means
that
its
candidates
failed
to
receive
20%
of
the
nationwide
vote
for
president.
but
it
also
means
one
more
thing.
it
means
that
the
party
is
registered
with
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
pursuant
to
section
901
of
the
election
code,
which
basically
requires
the
party
to
go
through
the
same
procedures
that
a
corporation
would
to
register.
it
has
to
file
its
bylaws,
submit
the
names
of
its
officers
and
any
other
information,
the
secretary
may
in
fact
desire.
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party
has
complied
with
this
requirement.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
it
is
and
it
is
not
your
honor.
the
republicans
of
course
have
been
on
the
ballot
by
petition
at
the
last
gubernatorial
election
before
this
one.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
he
received
the
plurality.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
callaway,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
also
pursuant
to
the
georgia
election
code,
the
candidates
of
the
georgia
socialist
workers
party
were
nominated
by
the
party
to
be
its
candidates
for
office
in
a
convention
of
the
party.
and
a
certification
of
their
nomination
was
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state.
so
we
don’t
have
here
exactly
the
case
of
completely
independent
candidates.
the
nominees
of
the
party
here
have
had
to
go
through
at
least
one
hurdle
before
they
get
to
the
problem
of
gathering
signatures.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
party
candidates
in
georgia
belonging
to
the
party
which
collected
20%
of
the
vote
for
governor
or
president
need
not
gather
any
signatures
at
all,
nor
need
their
party
in
its
primary
secure
any
definite
number
of
votes
before
they
can
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
final
election.
and
in
fact,
in
the
instant
case,
the
number
of
signatures
which
mrs.
jenness
would
have
been
required
to
secure,
exceeded
the
number
of
votes
that
were
actually
cast
in
the
republican
primary
for
the
winner
of
that
primary.
he
got
some
62,000
votes.
mrs.
jenness
would’ve
had
to
get
some
88,000
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
just
over
a
hundred
thousand,
your
honor.
so
it
was
slightly
in
excess
of
the
signature
requirement
that
she
was
required
to
meet.
but
there
is
absolutely
no
requirement
once
a
party
qualifies
as
a
party
that
it
in
its
primary
before
it
put
its
candidates
on
the
ballot
at
the
final
election
show
any
scintilla
of
voter
interest
in
the
party.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
at
the
last
previous
election.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
up
until
very
recently
of
course,
georgia
was
strictly
a
one
party
stand.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
no
question.
i
might
add
that
the
20%
requirement
came
in
for
the
first
time
in
1964.
prior
to
that
time
to
be
a
party
and
be
on
the
ballot
regularly,
going
back
to
1943,
all
you
needed
was
to
retain
5%
of
the
vote
at
previous
elections.
before
1943,
going
back
to
the
georgia
code
of
1922,
anybody
could
be
a
candidate
who
registered
himself
as
such
with
the
secretary
of
state.
there
was
no
requirement
that
his
party
secure
any
certain
number
of
votes,
nor
was
there
any
requirement
that
he
himself
get
a
petition
with
any
number
of
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
of
course
i
would
want
to
argue
that
you
don’t
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
we
think
the
5%
is
a
restriction
on
freedom
of
speech.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
terms
of
what’s
required
in
the
other
states,
or
the
vast
majority
of
those
other
states
require
1%
or
less.
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
the
reason
that
the
state
can
come
up
with
for
this
requirement,
it
seems
to
me
that
really
it’s
only
justification
would
possibly
be
to
protect
the
ballot
against
purely
frivolous
candidates.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
yes
it
would,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would.
unless
of
course
the
state
could
show
some
sort
of
danger
which
would
accrue
from
unlimited
numbers
of
candidates
getting
on
the
ballot.
i
don’t
think
that
based
on
what
the
court
said
about
the
ohio
case
or
based
upon
what
the
state
said
below
here
that
there
is
any
sort
of
conceivable
danger.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
all
right.
the
implication
of
that
it
seems
to
me
is
exactly
the
same
implication
that
the
recent
three-judge-court
in
ohio
in
the
decision
in
318
of
the
federal
supplement,
found
that
when
ohio
jumped
its
requirement
from
1%
to
7%,
and
later
back
to
4%,
the
state
had
to
show
some
sort
of
compelling
interest
for
that
increase.
ohio
was
unable
to
show
any
compelling
interest
for
that
increase,
similarly
in
georgia.
we
would
say
that
there
has
never
been
any
showing
by
state
that
the
increase
from
no
signature
requirement
to
5%
of
the
registered
voters
has
been
show.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
5%
requirement
was
adopted
completely
arbitrarily
in
1943,
it
was
continued
again
in
1964,
but
there’s
never
been
any
showing.
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
difficult
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
really
could
not
say.
it’s
not
like
the
situation
in
ohio
where
henry
wallace
received
enough
votes
as
to
cast
some
sort
of
doubt
about
the
result
of
the
election,
because
in
georgia,
going
back
to
1872,
every
time
there
has
been
a
statewide
race,
the
democrats
have
carried.
so,
it
strikes
me
that
it
was
a
revision
of
the
election
code,
and
while
they
were
revising
it,
someone
said
“well,
we
should
put
in
some
sort
of
a
requirement.”
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
any
reason
for
the
change
from
0%
to
5%.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no
it’s
just
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
it’s
just
as
it
was
in
ohio.
there
was
no
state
restriction
on
doing
first
amendment
kinds
of
things.
the
restriction
is
on
getting
on
the
ballot.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
making
speech
and
having
meetings
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
certainly.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
that
such
a
restriction
would
easily
fall
and
we
don’t
have
that
here.
there
is
one
specific
problem
with
the
write-in
vote
in
georgia
which
may
not
be
present
in
other
states.
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
direction
in
the
election
code
which
requires
write-in
votes
to
be
counted
by
the
people
counting
the
votes
exactly
as
they
are
written,
so
that
if
there
were
a
write-in
vote
for
linda
jenness,
and
another
for
mrs.
linda
jenness,
those
two
votes
would
be
counted
separately
and
however
many
write-in
votes
went
down
under
the
one
column
or
under
some
wrong
spelling
would
be
counted
separately,
there
would
be
no
accumulation
of
the
votes.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
they
count
write-in
votes,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
there’s
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
don’t
know
of
any
recent
example
of
a
write-in
ballot
or
being
elected
to
governor
in
georgia.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
it’s
conceivable.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
showing
in
the
record
as
to
whether
it
is
ever
happened.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
in
georgia.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
certainly
it
has
happened.
another
restriction
on
the
signature
gathering
that
takes
place
in
georgia
is
the
requirement
that
signatures
be
gathered
by
a
person
who
is
eligible
to
vote
for
the
office
that
is
being
sought.
for
example,
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
congressional
districts
which
divide
the
city
of
atlanta,
the
socialist
workers
party
could
not
gather
signatures
in
the
fifth
district
with
a
member
of
its
party
who
was
in
fact
registered
in
the
fourth
district.
and
this
i
think
is
an
impairment.
on
the
signature
gathering
requirement,
it
makes
it
i
think,
somewhat
more
difficult
than
it
appears
on
its
face.
it
means
that
unless
the
party
is
distributed
equally
among
congressional
districts,
its
chances
of
gathering
signatures
in
one
district
or
the
other
depends
not
on
the
membership
of
the
party,
but
on
where
the
members
of
that
party
live.
and
possibly
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well
of
course
in
the
statewide
election
anyone
living
anywhere
in
the
state
would
be
eligible
to
vote.
two
of
the
appellants
here
of
course
sought
congressional
districts.
they
were
not
running
for
at
large
congressional
seats,
they
were
running
for
specific
geographic
districts.
a
major
problem
it
seems
to
me
along
the
first
amendment
lines
is
in
the
problem
of
one’s
fcc
privileges
whether
one
can
get
free
or
equal
time,
if
one
is
only
a
write-in
candidate
or
if
one
is
a
candidate
who
is
duly
qualified.
fcc
or
at
least
the
television
stations
in
georgia
have
permitted
people
who
are
registered
with
the
secretary
of
state
as
write-in
candidates
to
enjoy
equal
time.
they
have
not
permitted
persons
who
are
not
registered
as
write-in
candidates
and
who
do
not
meet
the
signature
requirement
to
have
that
equal
time.
so
to
that
extent,
a
failure
to
either
register
yourself
as
a
write-in
candidate
or
to
appear
either
to
register
yourself
as
a
write-in
candidate
or
to
secure
the
signatures
is
in
fact
a
limitation
on
your
ability
to
appear
before
the
public.
in
terms
of
the
candidates
here,
the
record
has
their
affidavits
as
to
poverty,
their
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
in
fact
in
this
court.
the
record
also
contains
stipulation
of
the
parties
as
to
the
expense
that
was
incurred
by
the
secretary
of
state
in
checking
the
signatures
that
were
gathered
by
mr.
callaway
and
by
mr.
wallace
when
they
successfully
met
the
petition
requirements.
and
those
figures
are
some
$77,000.00
and
$81,000.00,
by
the
secretary
of
state
just
to
verify
the
signatures
which
were
gathered.
there
was
no
actual
showing
in
the
record
as
to
how
much
it
cost
to
gather
those
signatures,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
highly
reasonable
speculation
that
it
certainly
cost
at
least
that
amount
to
go
out
and
physically
gather
those
signatures.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
no,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
we
successfully
challenge
that
in
the
lower
court,
the
state
has
not
appealed.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
so,
if
they
were
able
to
get
their
signatures
and
show
poverty,
they
could
go
on
the
ballot
without
paying
a
fee.
i
think
the
argument
that
the
state
has
made
here
is
illustrative
of
the
fact
that
the
state
really
has
no
compelling
interest
in
this
requirement.
the
state
for
example
has
said
in
its
brief
that
georgia
does
not
have
very
restrictive
laws,
and
it
points
to
some
examples
of
other
states
with
more
restrictive
laws.
for
example,
states
where
if
you
have
voted
in
a
party
primary,
you
can
not
then
come
along
and
sign
and
petition
for
an
independent
or
a
nonpolitical
party
candidate.
it’s
quite
true
that
in
georgia,
anybody
as
long
as
he
is
a
registered
voter
can
sign
a
petition.
it
doesn’t
matter
if
he
intends
to
go
out
and
vote
in
the
democratic
or
the
republican
primary
the
next
day.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
very
freeness
that
georgia
offers
indicates
that
it
really
doesn’t
have
any
real
purpose
in
imposing
the
signature
requirement.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
i
certainly
don’t
have
to
make
that
argument
in
terms
of
reasonableness,
because
of
course
it
is
here
5%.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
would
think
your
honor,
subject
to
the
qualification
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
impose
some
sort
of
non-frivolous
barrier.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
non-frivolous.
i
think
they
might
well
be
able
to
protect
the
ballot
against
completely
frivolous
candidates.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
would
think
it
might
well
be.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
how
can
you
weigh
these
things?
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
i
think
to
go
to
as
much
as
5%
or
10%
of
the
actual
votes
becomes
unduly
burdensome.
it
becomes,
in
actual
terms,
an
impossibility
for
people
who
do
not
have
some
large
support.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
mean
both
money
mr.
chief
justice,
and
people
who
are
members
of
their
party
or
who
might
be
able
to
go
out
and
gather
signatures
for
them
to
say
nothing
of
people
who
might
be
willing
to
sign
on
their
behalf.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
well,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
views
will
be
very
unpopular
ones,
such
as
socialism
in
the
state
of
georgia.
i
take
the
fact
that
the
views
may
not
attract
a
large
number
of
adherence
is
not
really
the
determining
factor.
or
turning
to
the
young
people
for
example,
if
in
fact
they
were
not
registered
to
vote
in
georgia,
they
would
not
be
eligible
to
either
collect
signatures
or
to
sign
the
petitions
themselves.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
think
of
the
frivolous
candidate
is
someone
who
qualifies
for
office
just
because
he
wants
to
see
his
name
on
the
ballot.
it
may
well
be
that
even
he
has
first
amendment
rights
which
would
be
infringed
by
any
such
signature
requirement.
but
in
the
instant
case,
they
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
organizing
themselves
as
a
political
body
according
to
georgia
law.
they
have
filed
papers
with
the
secretary
of
state.
they
have
paid
him
a
minimum
fee
for
filing
those
papers.
i
think
they’ve
gone
far
beyond
any
sort
of
frivolous
question.
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
i
just
have
the
briefest
of
points,
your
honors.
first
one
when
my
opponent
says
that
the
1943
laws
were
less
restrictive
than
the
1922
laws,
he
is
just
plain
incorrect.
in
1922
and
the
election
code
found
in
the
1922
session
laws
at
page
100,
it
states
very
clearly
that
the
names
of
candidates
of
each
political
party
and
also
the
names
of
any
other
candidates
for
the
offices
to
be
filled
are
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
and
it
further
provides
that
all
candidates
for
national
and
state
offices
or
the
proper
authorities
of
the
political
party
nominating
them
shall
file
notice
of
their
candidacy,
giving
their
names
in
the
offices
for
which
they
are
candidates
with
the
secretary
of
state.
so
the
1943
move
from
no
petition
requirements
to
5%
was
in
fact
more
restrictive
up
until
that
time
anyone
could
get
on
the
ballot
simply
by
filing
a
notice
of
candidacy
with
the
secretary
of
state.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
in
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
that
is
correct.
the
law
says
“in
all
elections
other
than
primaries
conducted
by
a
political
party,
it
shall
be
the
duty
to
place
on
the
ballot
the
names
of
party
nominees
and
all
others
who
have
indicated
their
wish
to
be
candidates.”
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
yes
i
do.
i
think
the
state
is
adequately
protected
here
in
at
least
two
ways.
first,
the
closing
date
for
petition
requirements
is
the
same
date
as
the
closing
date
for
nominees
who
wish
to
enter
into
a
party
primary,
so
that
you
can
not
come
along
after
the
party
primary
and
file
a
notice
of
independent
candidacy,
unless
it’s
a
forgoing
conclusion
who’s
going
to
win
the
primary,
the
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
sometimes.
well,
i
think
the
election
spirit
in
georgia
is
in
a
little
more
rough
and
tumbled
than
that.
it’s
probably
safe
to
say
it’s
a
forgoing
conclusion
that
the
party
nominee
is
going
to
win.
but
there
in
the
--
mr.
peter
e.
rindskopf
the
democratic
party
nominee
usually
wins
the
election.
but
there
is
a
second
restriction
which
the
state
has
and
legitimately,
and
that
is
that
party
nominees
appear
on
the
ballot
along
with
a
party
designation
such
as
lester
maddox
democrat,
an
independent
nominee
wishing
to
put
a
fraud
upon
the
voters
by
appearing
under
the
same
name
would
not
have
that
party
designation.
it
seems
to
me
that’s
a
clear
way
of
preventing
what
happened
to
mr.
norris
in
ohio.
those
would
be
our
points
and
we
would
have
nothing
further.
