or
anything
such
as

justice

anywhere

justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
for
the
gubernatorial
candidate,
they
could’ve
all
come
from
fulton
county,
for
example.
justice

stewart
this
is
the
status
that
the
republican
party
occupied
for
quite
a
long
period
of
time
in
your
state,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
there
by
petition
because
they
occupied
the
status
of
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
and
their
candidate
in
fact
then
as

continuing
strength
in

managed
to
acquire
that
much
vote,
i
suppose?
justice

stewart
yes,
and
as
you
just
said,
the
up
until
very
recently,
the
republican
party
in
georgia
occupied
the
status
that
your
client
now
occupies?
justice

there’s
nothing
in
georgia
