harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
rindskopf,
as
i
remember
in
williams
against
rhodes,
the
figure
was
15%
of
actual
votes
cast,
am
i
correct
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
here
it
is
5%
of
the
registered
voters.
which
is
the
more
difficult
of
the
two
provisions
to
meet?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
incidentally,
is
a
write-in
permissible
in
georgia?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
rindskopf,
just
before
the
last
question,
you
were
tracing
the
georgia
legislative
history
and
said
that
at
one
time
there
was
no
percentage
requirement
at
all.
what
is
the
implication
of
that?
bring
me
along
a
little
more
closer.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
opposition
has
brought
out
the
fact
the
5%
figure
though
is
at
the
high
point
in
comparative
figures
with
other
states.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
that,
mr.
castellani?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
castellani,
i
hope
i’m
not
repeating
anything
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
you
because
i
couldn’t
hear
his
question.
but
do
you
have
--
do
you
know
of
any
reason
why
georgia
moved
from
no
requirement
at
all
to
the
present
one
that’s
under
challenged?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
suspicion
is
that
georgia
moved
in
the
direction
of
liberality,
rather
than
in
the
opposite
direction?
