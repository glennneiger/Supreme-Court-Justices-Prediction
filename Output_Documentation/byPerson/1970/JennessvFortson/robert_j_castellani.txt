mr.
robert
j.
castellani
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mrs.
jenness’s
argument
would
take
on
the
nominating
petition
laws
is
based
on
two
different
grounds.
first
ground
is
that
she
claims
there’s
a
denial
of
equal
protection
rights.
the
second
ground
is
that
she
claims
these
laws
violate
her
right
to
freedom
of
association,
as
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
we
shall
characterize
the
equal
protection
argument
as
the
“grass
is
always
greener
on
the
other
side”
argument.
in
georgia,
this
has
been
noted
by
this
court,
there
is
not
this
tremendous
imbalance
between
the
two
paths
or
methods
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot.
in
williams,
we
had
all
the
additional
burdens
that
were
placed
upon
third
party
candidates.
ohio
completely
eliminated
independent
candidates.
in
georgia,
except
for
the
actual
vehicle
itself;
that
is
the
petition
method
as
opposed
to
the
primary
method,
there
is
not
this
imbalance.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
result
of
the
three-judge-court
decision
below,
if
you
go
the
petition
method
and
you
can
allege
poverty,
you
do
not
have
to
pay
any
qualifying
fees.
we
therefore
think
this
lawsuit
is
bottom
on
an
incorrect
assumption.
the
assumption
that’s
incorrect
is
that
a
primary
method
is
easier
than
a
petition
method.
we
believe
that
if
anyone
went
through
both
of
these
methods,
he
would
seriously
question
this
assumption.
now
mrs.
jenness
sees
a
primary
as
a
method
whereby
a
candidate
merely
sits
at
home
and
waits
for
the
votes
to
come
to
his
door
and
he’s
automatically
nominated
and
authorized
to
go
on
the
general
election
ballot.
in
fact
that
is
not
the
case.
a
primary
candidate
has
to
expend
tremendous
amounts
of
energy,
his
own
resources.
he
has
organizational
problems.
the
complexities
of
a
campaign
particularly
for
the
gubernatorial
nomination
in
georgia
are
simply
not
recognized
by
mrs.
jenness
when
she
sees
this
imbalance
between
the
two
methods.
further,
if
a
general
primary
candidate
is
defeated,
he
never
has
a
chance
to
get
to
the
general
election
ballot.
whereas,
with
a
person
who’s
going
to
petition
method,
once
they
obtained
the
required
petition,
there
is
no
problem
with
going
on
the
ballot.
they
are
automatically
certified
and
they
on
the
general
election
ballot.
therefore,
we
believe
that
while
the
grass
may
seem
greener
to
mrs.
jenness
in
actual
fact,
close
and
a
realistic
examination
of
the
two
methods
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot
in
georgia
will
show
that
there
is
no
inequality
and
her
claim
on
this
basis
must
fail.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
if
you
only
look
at
the
number
of
petition
signatures
that
are
required,
georgia
although
it’s
not
the
highest
is
probably
higher
than
most.
however,
as
we
attempted
to
show
in
our
brief,
there
are
numerous
other
disabilities
that
are
placed
upon
petition
gatherers
in
other
states
that
have
these
lower
total
requirements.
if
i
might,
some
states
require
that
when
you
sign
this
petition,
you
have
to
agree
to
support
the
candidate
in
the
general
election.
georgia
has
nothing
like
this
at
all.
some
states
prohibits
you
from
participating
in
any
primary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mrs.
jenness
could
participate
in
the
party
primary
of
her
choice
in
georgia.
she
could
run
as
a
petition
candidate
and
yet
go
and
vote
in
the
primary
and
vote
for
the
person
that
she
would
most
likely
lo
oppose
in
the
general
election.
some
states
forbid
you
to
sign
any
other
petition
besides
the
first
one,
the
first
person
who
gets
to
you.
that’s
it.
you
are
disqualified
for
either
after.
in
georgia,
you
can
sign
as
many
petitions
as
you
want.
some
states
require
that
you
must
not
be
registered
in
any
other
political
party.
at
least
one
state,
i
believe
it's
rhode
island,
they
prohibit
you
from
participating
in
any
primary
for
26
months
after
you
sign
the
petition.
now,
we
did
not
make
an
exhaustive
study
of
all
the
state
laws.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
this
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
well
sir,
the
first
--
the
late
date
was
1943,
secondly
this
method
was
because
49
of
the
50
states
depend
upon
nominating
petitions
as
an
alternative
in
one
form
or
another.
florida
is
the
only
state
that
i
know
who
does
not
use
the
nominating
petition
method
as
an
alternative.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
justice
marshall,
i’m
not
a
georgia
historian.
i
don’t
believe
i
can
answer
that
question.
it’s
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
no
sir.
i
mean
i
think
that
that
figure
was
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
well
the
state’s
interest
in
5%
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
realized
that
this
court
has
looked
at
an
awful
lot
of
election
cases
and
you
have
had
the
interest
thrown
at
you.
we
think
that
there
are
probably
three
interests
that
probably
overlapped.
but
the
first
interest
is,
has
been
noted
by
the
court,
completely
frivolous
candidates
for
however
you
wanted
to
find
what
you
consider
frivolous
candidates.
we
think
of
them
as
the
personal
publicity
seekers,
a
person
who’s
wasting
everyone’s
time,
if
i
could
use
that
term.
the
second
interest
is
that
the
national
movement
today
is
an
attempt
to
get
more
people
to
vote
to
make
it
easier
to
vote,
and
we’ve
had
numerous
comments
about
the
fact
that
georgia
had
12
candidates
for
governor
in
the
primary,
and
was
just
too
confusing
and
people
just
couldn’t
make
up
their
mind.
we
think
that’s
an
interest
to
keep
it
down
to
serious
candidates.
we
also
believe
that
by
having
this
requirement,
you
can
--
to
a
certain
degree,
encourage
stability
and
compromise.
if
every
splinter
group
knows
that
they
have
unlimited
access
to
the
general
election
ballot,
they’re
going
to
just
go
their
own
separate
ways,
and
we
think
that
this
is
not
conducive
to
a
good
electoral
process.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
and
i
say
there
are
no
legislative
materials
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
that
would
indicate
why
five.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes,
there
are
other
states
with
five,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i
don’t
remember,
i
think
it’s
three
or
four
plus
several
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
--
territories.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
oh
we
did.
we
admit
that
we
passed
some.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
because
i
attempted
to
show
before
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
well,
they
made
the
figure
5%,
and
again
i
can’t
say
why
they
chose
5%.
maybe
they
thought
about
10
and
decided
to
cut
it
in
half.
i
just
don’t
know,
i
just
don’t
know.
but
the
thing
is
they
made
it
so
much
easier
to
gather
these
petition.
most
of
these
other
states
with
the
1%
or
the
1
1/2
or
2%
also,
and
this
is
what
bothers
me
is
that
if
in
another
state
you
go
out
and
you
sign
one
of
these
petitions,
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
the
person
who’s
gathering
these
signatures
tells
you
that
“now
wait
a
minute.
if
you
sign
this
petition
you’re
not
going
to
be
able
to
vote
in
the
primary,
or
that
you
can’t
be
registered
with
another
party,
or
that
you’re
gong
to
be
disqualified.”
georgia
has
opted
for
the
other
procedure,
5%.
but
as
long
as
you’re
registered,
sign
as
many
petitions
as
you
want
and
continue
to
participate
in
the
political
party
primaries,
and
this
is
their
method.
now
i
can’t
--
i
couldn’t
give
you
an
explanation
as
to
why
5%
was
chosen.
i’m
sorry,
i
have
talked
with
several
people
and
they
just
don’t
know.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i
had
a
guess
and
unfortunately
i
did
not
prepare
myself
on
this
point,
and
i
apologize,
i
probably
should
have.
i
think
that
previously,
georgia
did
not
authorize
anybody,
did
not
allow
independent
candidates
to
run.
you
had
to
be
a
party
candidate.
and
then
i’m
not
--
i
think
that
there
are
several
states
where
this
was
the
case.
and
in
my
research
of
this
question,
this
problem
has
come
up.
there
were
five
or
six
states
where
you
had
to
be
on
a
party.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sis,
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
it
had
been
previous
to
the
1930’s
and
the
1940’s
before
this
came
in.
i
believe
there
was
a
--
you
had
to
be
a
party
candidate
now
you
couldn’t
get
out
on
general
election
bill.
but
i’m
not
sure
about
that
and
i
apologize.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir.
i
would
agree
they
would.
as
i
set
preface
to
my
remarks,
i
don’t
pretend
to
be
an
expert
in
the
area
of
election
laws.
and
i
think
that
this
court
in
its
experience
is
certainly
come
across
more
cases
and
is
more
aware
of
the
interest
that
a
state
has
and
i
could
--
i
think
of
the
ones
that
i
think
are
the
most
obvious
to
most
people
who
are
in
this
area.
but
of
course
this
court
surely
that
is
a
legitimate
consideration.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
which
white
primary
case
mr.
justice
--?
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i’m
not
familiar
with
that
case
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
again
i
said,
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
history
of
georgia
around
1944,
so
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
could
it
have
been
to
keep
out
third
party?
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i
can’t
say.
i
can’t
say
what
the
motive
or
i
can’t
say
that
there
was
one
overriding
motive
over
all
these
other
motives.
i
just
--
i
wasn’t
there
and
i
haven’t
been
able
to
talk
with
anybody
who’s
been
able
to
give
me
one
good
reason
why.
they
all
have
their
own
versions
to
what
they
recall,
but
that’s
it.
and
i
doubt
that
that
would
be
evidence
before
this
court
anyway.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir,
but
i’m
not
so
sure
that
the
law
is
the
instrument
in
which
kept
out
even
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
--
any
of
the
second
party.
i
think
that
the
historical
background
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir,
because
the
second
ground
on
which
these
nominating
petition
laws
are
challenged
are
that
they
violate
this
freedom
of
association
right
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
court
in
williams
versus
rhode.
of
course,
williams’
case
is
the
touchstone
case
in
this
field.
we
hope
that
this
court
can
see
the
differences
between
georgia’s
laws
and
ohio’s
laws.
this
court
several
time
in
its
opinion
in
williams
stressed
this
entangling
web,
the
totality
of
the
ohio
structure
that
made
it
impossible
for
third
parties
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot.
we
believe
that
we
have
shown
that
georgia
has
only
the
actual
vehicle
itself.
that’s
the
only
difference
that
there
is.
now,
we
would
like
also
to
stress
to
the
court
that
this
law
is
not
an
absolute
bar
to
appearing
on
the
ballot.
it
maybe
treated
by
some
as
the
bar,
but
it
is
not.
we
have
indicated
before
numerous
candidates
both
statewide
candidates
and
local
candidates
have
gained
access
to
the
general
election
ballot
through
the
petition
method.
now
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
this
is
the
method
under
consideration
of
5%
as
we
called
the
petition
method
as
opposed
to
primary
method.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir.
two
most
noteworthy
examples
statewide
are
of
course,
george
wallace
and
before
him
howard
bo
callaway,
the
candidate
for
governor
who
received
the
plurality
but
did
not
receive
the
majority,
and
this
court
decided
fortson
versus
morris
that
the
legislature
could
go
ahead
and
elect
and
elected
his
opponent.
and
mrs.
jenness
has
argued
that
it
is
an
absolute
bar
to
her
because
she
simply
can’t
meet
it.
well,
we
would
first
say
to
this
court
that
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
she
or
anyone
in
her
class
has
ever
tried
to
meet
it.
we
don’t
know
what
kind
of
effort
would
be
required
because
they’ve
never
tried,
or
at
least
the
record
doesn’t
show
that
they
ever
tried
to
go
out
and
gather
signatures.
now
we
will
admit
that
some
expenditure
of
effort
is
needed.
however,
as
we
have
indicated
before,
expenditure
of
effort
is
also
needed
to
win
a
primary
and
we
believe
that
before
you
can
gain
access
to
the
general
election
ballot,
the
state
does
have
a
right
to
require
this
showing.
we
also
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
court
decision
below
had
removed
the
qualifying
fee
from
paupers.
as
this
court
also
indicated
previously,
the
nominating
petition
law
does
not
impinge
in
any
way
on
the
right
of
mrs.
jenness
to
meet
with
others
or
for
choice,
the
whole
public
meetings
to
advocate
any
idea,
to
solicit
members
to
her
group,
or
short
to
do
anything
else
to
gain
access
to
the
minds
of
her
fellow
citizens
and
to
seek
to
persuade
them
to
her
political
point
of
view.
now,
as
i
had
indicated,
49
states
have
nominating
petition
laws.
again,
some
are
higher,
most
are
lower,
some
the
same
as
georgia’s.
however,
as
we’ve
indicated,
these
other
restrictions
we
think
can
at
least
point
out
to
this
court
why
although
georgia
on
its
face
may
be
higher
than
some
of
the
states,
perhaps
majority
of
the
states
that
you
can’t
just
judge
nominating
petition
laws
on
the
number
of
signatures
required.
you
need
to
go
deeper
into
the
election
code
into
the
election
scheme
if
you’re
going
to
make
a
comparison
of
georgia
with
the
other
states
in
the
nation.
we
would
stress
to
this
court
that
election
codes
are
not
static
instruments.
they
are
continuously
being
revised.
they’re
under
study
by
the
legislature,
at
private
citizens
groups,
by
interested
people.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
authorize
the
use
of
nominating
petitions
by
the
49
states
who’d
depend
on
them
to
help
their
election
laws.
the
national
movement
and
election
laws
today
is
to
make
it
easier
to
vote,
get
people
to
the
polls.
we
believe
that
the
petition
law
has
a
valid
requirement
and
has
--
the
state
has
an
interest
in
upholding
it.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge-court
below
and
authorize
its
use.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mrs.
jenness’s
argument
would
take
on
the
nominating
petition
laws
is
based
on
two
different
grounds.
first
ground
is
that
she
claims
there’s
a
denial
of
equal
protection
rights.
the
second
ground
is
that
she
claims
these
laws
violate
her
right
to
freedom
of
association,
as
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
we
shall
characterize
the
equal
protection
argument
as
the
“grass
is
always
greener
on
the
other
side”
argument.
in
georgia,
this
has
been
noted
by
this
court,
there
is
not
this
tremendous
imbalance
between
the
two
paths
or
methods
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot.
in
williams,
we
had
all
the
additional
burdens
that
were
placed
upon
third
party
candidates.
ohio
completely
eliminated
independent
candidates.
in
georgia,
except
for
the
actual
vehicle
itself;
that
is
the
petition
method
as
opposed
to
the
primary
method,
there
is
not
this
imbalance.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
result
of
the
three-judge-court
decision
below,
if
you
go
the
petition
method
and
you
can
allege
poverty,
you
do
not
have
to
pay
any
qualifying
fees.
we
therefore
think
this
lawsuit
is
bottom
on
an
incorrect
assumption.
the
assumption
that’s
incorrect
is
that
a
primary
method
is
easier
than
a
petition
method.
we
believe
that
if
anyone
went
through
both
of
these
methods,
he
would
seriously
question
this
assumption.
now
mrs.
jenness
sees
a
primary
as
a
method
whereby
a
candidate
merely
sits
at
home
and
waits
for
the
votes
to
come
to
his
door
and
he’s
automatically
nominated
and
authorized
to
go
on
the
general
election
ballot.
in
fact
that
is
not
the
case.
a
primary
candidate
has
to
expend
tremendous
amounts
of
energy,
his
own
resources.
he
has
organizational
problems.
the
complexities
of
a
campaign
particularly
for
the
gubernatorial
nomination
in
georgia
are
simply
not
recognized
by
mrs.
jenness
when
she
sees
this
imbalance
between
the
two
methods.
further,
if
a
general
primary
candidate
is
defeated,
he
never
has
a
chance
to
get
to
the
general
election
ballot.
whereas,
with
a
person
who’s
going
to
petition
method,
once
they
obtained
the
required
petition,
there
is
no
problem
with
going
on
the
ballot.
they
are
automatically
certified
and
they
on
the
general
election
ballot.
therefore,
we
believe
that
while
the
grass
may
seem
greener
to
mrs.
jenness
in
actual
fact,
close
and
a
realistic
examination
of
the
two
methods
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot
in
georgia
will
show
that
there
is
no
inequality
and
her
claim
on
this
basis
must
fail.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
if
you
only
look
at
the
number
of
petition
signatures
that
are
required,
georgia
although
it’s
not
the
highest
is
probably
higher
than
most.
however,
as
we
attempted
to
show
in
our
brief,
there
are
numerous
other
disabilities
that
are
placed
upon
petition
gatherers
in
other
states
that
have
these
lower
total
requirements.
if
i
might,
some
states
require
that
when
you
sign
this
petition,
you
have
to
agree
to
support
the
candidate
in
the
general
election.
georgia
has
nothing
like
this
at
all.
some
states
prohibits
you
from
participating
in
any
primary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mrs.
jenness
could
participate
in
the
party
primary
of
her
choice
in
georgia.
she
could
run
as
a
petition
candidate
and
yet
go
and
vote
in
the
primary
and
vote
for
the
person
that
she
would
most
likely
lo
oppose
in
the
general
election.
some
states
forbid
you
to
sign
any
other
petition
besides
the
first
one,
the
first
person
who
gets
to
you.
that’s
it.
you
are
disqualified
for
either
after.
in
georgia,
you
can
sign
as
many
petitions
as
you
want.
some
states
require
that
you
must
not
be
registered
in
any
other
political
party.
at
least
one
state,
i
believe
it's
rhode
island,
they
prohibit
you
from
participating
in
any
primary
for
26
months
after
you
sign
the
petition.
now,
we
did
not
make
an
exhaustive
study
of
all
the
state
laws.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
this
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
well
sir,
the
first
--
the
late
date
was
1943,
secondly
this
method
was
because
49
of
the
50
states
depend
upon
nominating
petitions
as
an
alternative
in
one
form
or
another.
florida
is
the
only
state
that
i
know
who
does
not
use
the
nominating
petition
method
as
an
alternative.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
justice
marshall,
i’m
not
a
georgia
historian.
i
don’t
believe
i
can
answer
that
question.
it’s
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
no
sir.
i
mean
i
think
that
that
figure
was
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
well
the
state’s
interest
in
5%
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
realized
that
this
court
has
looked
at
an
awful
lot
of
election
cases
and
you
have
had
the
interest
thrown
at
you.
we
think
that
there
are
probably
three
interests
that
probably
overlapped.
but
the
first
interest
is,
has
been
noted
by
the
court,
completely
frivolous
candidates
for
however
you
wanted
to
find
what
you
consider
frivolous
candidates.
we
think
of
them
as
the
personal
publicity
seekers,
a
person
who’s
wasting
everyone’s
time,
if
i
could
use
that
term.
the
second
interest
is
that
the
national
movement
today
is
an
attempt
to
get
more
people
to
vote
to
make
it
easier
to
vote,
and
we’ve
had
numerous
comments
about
the
fact
that
georgia
had
12
candidates
for
governor
in
the
primary,
and
was
just
too
confusing
and
people
just
couldn’t
make
up
their
mind.
we
think
that’s
an
interest
to
keep
it
down
to
serious
candidates.
we
also
believe
that
by
having
this
requirement,
you
can
--
to
a
certain
degree,
encourage
stability
and
compromise.
if
every
splinter
group
knows
that
they
have
unlimited
access
to
the
general
election
ballot,
they’re
going
to
just
go
their
own
separate
ways,
and
we
think
that
this
is
not
conducive
to
a
good
electoral
process.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
and
i
say
there
are
no
legislative
materials
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
that
would
indicate
why
five.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes,
there
are
other
states
with
five,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i
don’t
remember,
i
think
it’s
three
or
four
plus
several
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
--
territories.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
oh
we
did.
we
admit
that
we
passed
some.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
because
i
attempted
to
show
before
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
well,
they
made
the
figure
5%,
and
again
i
can’t
say
why
they
chose
5%.
maybe
they
thought
about
10
and
decided
to
cut
it
in
half.
i
just
don’t
know,
i
just
don’t
know.
but
the
thing
is
they
made
it
so
much
easier
to
gather
these
petition.
most
of
these
other
states
with
the
1%
or
the
1
1/2
or
2%
also,
and
this
is
what
bothers
me
is
that
if
in
another
state
you
go
out
and
you
sign
one
of
these
petitions,
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
the
person
who’s
gathering
these
signatures
tells
you
that
“now
wait
a
minute.
if
you
sign
this
petition
you’re
not
going
to
be
able
to
vote
in
the
primary,
or
that
you
can’t
be
registered
with
another
party,
or
that
you’re
gong
to
be
disqualified.”
georgia
has
opted
for
the
other
procedure,
5%.
but
as
long
as
you’re
registered,
sign
as
many
petitions
as
you
want
and
continue
to
participate
in
the
political
party
primaries,
and
this
is
their
method.
now
i
can’t
--
i
couldn’t
give
you
an
explanation
as
to
why
5%
was
chosen.
i’m
sorry,
i
have
talked
with
several
people
and
they
just
don’t
know.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i
had
a
guess
and
unfortunately
i
did
not
prepare
myself
on
this
point,
and
i
apologize,
i
probably
should
have.
i
think
that
previously,
georgia
did
not
authorize
anybody,
did
not
allow
independent
candidates
to
run.
you
had
to
be
a
party
candidate.
and
then
i’m
not
--
i
think
that
there
are
several
states
where
this
was
the
case.
and
in
my
research
of
this
question,
this
problem
has
come
up.
there
were
five
or
six
states
where
you
had
to
be
on
a
party.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sis,
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
it
had
been
previous
to
the
1930’s
and
the
1940’s
before
this
came
in.
i
believe
there
was
a
--
you
had
to
be
a
party
candidate
now
you
couldn’t
get
out
on
general
election
bill.
but
i’m
not
sure
about
that
and
i
apologize.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir.
i
would
agree
they
would.
as
i
set
preface
to
my
remarks,
i
don’t
pretend
to
be
an
expert
in
the
area
of
election
laws.
and
i
think
that
this
court
in
its
experience
is
certainly
come
across
more
cases
and
is
more
aware
of
the
interest
that
a
state
has
and
i
could
--
i
think
of
the
ones
that
i
think
are
the
most
obvious
to
most
people
who
are
in
this
area.
but
of
course
this
court
surely
that
is
a
legitimate
consideration.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
which
white
primary
case
mr.
justice
--?
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i’m
not
familiar
with
that
case
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
again
i
said,
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
history
of
georgia
around
1944,
so
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
could
it
have
been
to
keep
out
third
party?
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
i
can’t
say.
i
can’t
say
what
the
motive
or
i
can’t
say
that
there
was
one
overriding
motive
over
all
these
other
motives.
i
just
--
i
wasn’t
there
and
i
haven’t
been
able
to
talk
with
anybody
who’s
been
able
to
give
me
one
good
reason
why.
they
all
have
their
own
versions
to
what
they
recall,
but
that’s
it.
and
i
doubt
that
that
would
be
evidence
before
this
court
anyway.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir,
but
i’m
not
so
sure
that
the
law
is
the
instrument
in
which
kept
out
even
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
--
any
of
the
second
party.
i
think
that
the
historical
background
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir,
because
the
second
ground
on
which
these
nominating
petition
laws
are
challenged
are
that
they
violate
this
freedom
of
association
right
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
court
in
williams
versus
rhode.
of
course,
williams’
case
is
the
touchstone
case
in
this
field.
we
hope
that
this
court
can
see
the
differences
between
georgia’s
laws
and
ohio’s
laws.
this
court
several
time
in
its
opinion
in
williams
stressed
this
entangling
web,
the
totality
of
the
ohio
structure
that
made
it
impossible
for
third
parties
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot.
we
believe
that
we
have
shown
that
georgia
has
only
the
actual
vehicle
itself.
that’s
the
only
difference
that
there
is.
now,
we
would
like
also
to
stress
to
the
court
that
this
law
is
not
an
absolute
bar
to
appearing
on
the
ballot.
it
maybe
treated
by
some
as
the
bar,
but
it
is
not.
we
have
indicated
before
numerous
candidates
both
statewide
candidates
and
local
candidates
have
gained
access
to
the
general
election
ballot
through
the
petition
method.
now
--
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
this
is
the
method
under
consideration
of
5%
as
we
called
the
petition
method
as
opposed
to
primary
method.
mr.
robert
j.
castellani
yes
sir.
two
most
noteworthy
examples
statewide
are
of
course,
george
wallace
and
before
him
howard
bo
callaway,
the
candidate
for
governor
who
received
the
plurality
but
did
not
receive
the
majority,
and
this
court
decided
fortson
versus
morris
that
the
legislature
could
go
ahead
and
elect
and
elected
his
opponent.
and
mrs.
jenness
has
argued
that
it
is
an
absolute
bar
to
her
because
she
simply
can’t
meet
it.
well,
we
would
first
say
to
this
court
that
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
she
or
anyone
in
her
class
has
ever
tried
to
meet
it.
we
don’t
know
what
kind
of
effort
would
be
required
because
they’ve
never
tried,
or
at
least
the
record
doesn’t
show
that
they
ever
tried
to
go
out
and
gather
signatures.
now
we
will
admit
that
some
expenditure
of
effort
is
needed.
however,
as
we
have
indicated
before,
expenditure
of
effort
is
also
needed
to
win
a
primary
and
we
believe
that
before
you
can
gain
access
to
the
general
election
ballot,
the
state
does
have
a
right
to
require
this
showing.
we
also
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
court
decision
below
had
removed
the
qualifying
fee
from
paupers.
as
this
court
also
indicated
previously,
the
nominating
petition
law
does
not
impinge
in
any
way
on
the
right
of
mrs.
jenness
to
meet
with
others
or
for
choice,
the
whole
public
meetings
to
advocate
any
idea,
to
solicit
members
to
her
group,
or
short
to
do
anything
else
to
gain
access
to
the
minds
of
her
fellow
citizens
and
to
seek
to
persuade
them
to
her
political
point
of
view.
now,
as
i
had
indicated,
49
states
have
nominating
petition
laws.
again,
some
are
higher,
most
are
lower,
some
the
same
as
georgia’s.
however,
as
we’ve
indicated,
these
other
restrictions
we
think
can
at
least
point
out
to
this
court
why
although
georgia
on
its
face
may
be
higher
than
some
of
the
states,
perhaps
majority
of
the
states
that
you
can’t
just
judge
nominating
petition
laws
on
the
number
of
signatures
required.
you
need
to
go
deeper
into
the
election
code
into
the
election
scheme
if
you’re
going
to
make
a
comparison
of
georgia
with
the
other
states
in
the
nation.
we
would
stress
to
this
court
that
election
codes
are
not
static
instruments.
they
are
continuously
being
revised.
they’re
under
study
by
the
legislature,
at
private
citizens
groups,
by
interested
people.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
authorize
the
use
of
nominating
petitions
by
the
49
states
who’d
depend
on
them
to
help
their
election
laws.
the
national
movement
and
election
laws
today
is
to
make
it
easier
to
vote,
get
people
to
the
polls.
we
believe
that
the
petition
law
has
a
valid
requirement
and
has
--
the
state
has
an
interest
in
upholding
it.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge-court
below
and
authorize
its
use.
thank
you.
