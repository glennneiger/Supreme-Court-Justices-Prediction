mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
which
was
brought
by
the
state
of
utah
under
authority
granted
by
the
congress
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
or
utah
prior
to
a
quitclaim
deed
given
by
the
united
states,
had
title
to
the
lands
lying
below
the
meander
line
of
the
great
salt
lake
which
is
a
shallow
and
very
salty
body
of
water
of
some
size
lying
wholly
within
the
state
of
utah
in
its
northern
portion.
after
a
variety
of
procedural
rulings
which
i
need
not
to
remind
the
court
of.
the
case
was
referred
to
special
master,
the
honorable
j.
cullen
ganey
to
report
to
this
court
on
the
issue
of
the
title.
that
issue
has
several
aspects
and
then
the
proceedings
immediately
had
had,
he
decided
only
one
of
those
which
is
whether
the
great
salt
lake
was
a
navigable
body
of
water
on
the
day
when
utah
became
a
state,
january
4,
1896.
and
the
parties
have
fully
agreed
that
if
the
great
salt
lake
was
not
navigable
on
that
day,
then
the
united
states
continued
its
ownership
of
all
the
lands
below
the
meander
line
and
in
that
situation,
further
proceedings
will
eventually
be
required
to
determine
if
the
market
value
of
the
lands
which
have
subsequently
been
quickclaimed
to
utah,
so
that
utah
may
pay
that
value
for
the
quitclaim
deed.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
great
salt
lake
was
navigable
on
that
day
in
january
1896
then
the
lake
that
passed
to
utah
at
that
time,
instant
as
part
of
the
operation
of
the
principle
of
equal
footing
or
equality
among
the
states,
then
is
no
necessity
for
utah
to
pay
for
lands
which
were
within
the
boundaries
of
the
lake
as
they
existed
on
that
day,
save
possibly
for
such
lands
as
have
been
since
relicted
by
the
recession
of
the
lake
from
its
shores.
and
the
issues
where
the
boundaries
of
the
lake
were
on
january
4,
1896
and
whether
the
united
states
continued
entitle
or
obtain
title
to
such
lands
as
might
have
relicted
after
that
date,
again,
is
an
issue
which
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
and
which
would
have
to
be
decided
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
if
the
court
should
rule
for
utah
in
the
present
proceedings.
and
i
might
just
very
briefly
remark
in
that
connection,
that
while
the
report
of
the
special
master
is
in
some
minor
respect
possibly
seems
to
rule
on
the
reliction
issue
on
the
one
hand
in
conclusion
of
law
18
or
in
the
proposed
decree
to
state
that
if
the
lake
was
navigable,
utah
obtained
titles
to
all
lands
within
the
meander
line,
i
think
it
is
clear
and
that
counsel
for
utah
will
agree
that
the
issues
are
as
i
have
stated.
the
question
of
reliction
remains
open
for
future
decision
and
if
the
lake
was
navigable
on
january
4th,
the
lands
which
utah
took
at
that
time
were
the
lands
which
were
under
the
lake's
waters
at
that
time
and
not
the
lands
which
might
have
happen
to
be
within
the
meander
line
which
had
been
drawn
at
some
earlier
time.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
it's
question
of
construction,
indeed
whether
the
decree
is
inconsistent.
if
it
is
susceptible
to
a
reading
then
it's
inconsistent
with
what
i've
stated.
this
court
has
always
followed
the
practice
in
past
of
inviting
proposals
for
decree
after
original
cases
and
i
--
we
have
been
assuming
it
would
do
so
in
this
case
then
we
can
confront
the
question
at
that
time.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
issue
which
is
here
as
i've
said,
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
great
salt
lake
was
navigable
on
the
day
that
utah
became
a
state.
there
were
hearings
in
salt
lake
city
before
the
master.
both
oral
testimony
and
numerous
documents
were
produced
and
on
that
basis,
the
special
master
has
prepared
a
lengthy
report
in
which
he
concludes
that
the
lake
is
navigable.
and
while
we
dispute
that
final
conclusion,
i
should
make
it
clear
as
i
think
our
brief
does
that
on
the
whole
we
acknowledge
that
the
report
is
correct
and
the
statement
to
the
fact
strictly
speaking
of
the
case
we
think
the
master
has
done
an
excellent
job
and
don't
mean
by
arguing
legal
points
here
to
suggest
otherwise.
we
accept
all
the
strictly
factual
findings
made
in
the
report
and
have
made
exceptions
only
the
findings
of
law
and
to
two
of
the
findings
of
fact
which
in
our
view,
embody
essentially
mixed
questions
of
law
and
of
fact.
we
contend
that
the
lake
was
not
navigable
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
lake
presents
such
obstacles
to
navigation
in
its
natural
state
that
it
could
never
be
used
as
a
channel
of
useful
commerce
and
trade
by
water
without
improvements
of
an
unusual
extent
being
made.
and
the
second
is
that
even
if
the
lake
were
navigable,
in
fact,
it
lacks
any
connection
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
trade
and
for
that
reason,
it
should
be
found
not
navigable
in
law.
taking
up
the
question
of
navigability
in
fact
again,
the
parties
are
largely
in
agreement
of
what
the
underlying
law
is.
the
proper
test
was
first
stated
by
this
court
in
the
daniel
ball
in
10
wallace
and
the
court
said
there
that
waters
are
navigable,
in
fact,
when
they
are
used
or
are
susceptible
of
being
used
in
their
ordinary
condition
as
highways
for
commerce
over
which
trade
and
travel
are
or
maybe
conducted
in
the
customary
mode
of
trade
and
travel
on
water.
and
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
the
principal
dispute
here
is
what
that
word
susceptible
means.
perhaps,
some
argument
about
the
extent
to
which
improvements
may
occur
without
departing
from
the
ordinary
conditions
of
waters.
and
what
the
court
meant
when
it
said,
that
they
must
be
useful
as
highways
for
commerce.
the
master
did
not
find
that
the
great
salt
lake
was
actually
in
use
as
a
highway
for
commerce
on
january
4,
1896.
he
found
only
that
it
was
capable
or
susceptible
of
such
use.
not
counting
excursion
trips
which
have
been
made
he
found
the
boating
uses
of
the
lake
have
been
more
of
a
private
nature
rather
than
by
individual
contractors
for
hire,
that's
finding
of
fact
51.
in
finding
of
fact
52,
he's
found
no
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
ever
any
regularly
scheduled
freight
or
passenger
service
operated
on
the
lake.
so,
the
question
is
whether
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
this
lake
in
its
ordinary
natural
condition
could
become
a
highway
of
commerce.
the
master's
report
on
the
whole
is
a
discussion
of
that
question.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
--
he
found
that
on
that
date,
the
lake
was
approximately
77
miles
long
and
taking
its
greatest
length
about
33
miles
wide
and
exposed
approximately
100
and
--
excuse
me,
15,000
square
miles
of
water
and
to
the
sun.
that
its
elevation,
there
is
some
confusion,
i
think
there's
a
typographical
error
at
one
point
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
he
found
that
its
elevation
at
statehood
was
4,201
feet
which
would
give
it,
at
its
greatest
depth,
the
depth
of
30
feet,
an
average
depth
of
13
feet.
we
have
submitted
to
the
clerk
and
to
counsel
and
asked
him
to
distribute
to
you
a
small
map
of
the
lake
to
which
i'll
be
referring
later
on
in
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh.
well
basically,
perhaps
the
simplest
way
to
answer
it
would
be
to
refer
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
montello
which
involved
the
fox
river.
the
fox
river
was
a
body
river
which
had
water
--
which
had
existed
in
nature.
would
transport
boats
of
two-and-a-half
foot
depths
down
it
for
a
considerable
distance,
although,
there
was
some
rapids
and
riffles
to
be
gone
through.
it
had
been
improved
by
the
time
a
case
got
to
this
court,
questioning
whether
it
was
a
navigable
waterway
or
not.
and
in
deciding
whether
it
was
a
navigable
waterway,
the
court
said,
“we
will
not
concern
ourselves
with
those
improvements,
with
those
canals,
ditches,
locks
and
so
forth,
but
rather
with
the
river
as
it
was
when
man
found
it,
unimproved,
unexcavated,
entrenched”
and
the
issue
was
whether
in
those
circumstances,
it
could
carry
trade
and
commerce
and
the
court
found
that
these
boats
of
two-and-a-half
foot
depths
carrying
substantial
loads
of
lumber
and
other
goods,
in
fact,
frequently
ran
the
river
engaging
in
commerce
of
a
very
substantial
sort
on
it.
and
so
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
mr.
justice
douglas.
thankfully,
again,
1896
perhaps
is
helpful
to
us
in
that
respect
that
it's
quite
clear
from
the
cases
that
the
question
of
navigation
is
with
the
means
of
navigation
which
were
available
at
the
time
and
i
don't
believe
that
an
airboat
would
have
been
available
in
1896.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
it
is.
i
think
it
may
also
be
--
i
think
another
appropriate
response
to
that
of
course
one
has
today
amphibious
trucks
of
enormous
dimension
and
hovercraft
and
the
like.
virtually
no
case
which
this
court
has
decided
would
not
involve
a
body
of
water
which
couldn't
be
navigated
by
one
or
another
of
those
crafts.
the
united
states
versus
oregon,
for
example,
the
waters
in
those
lakes
were
in
some
places
only
inches
deep.
quite
plainly,
one
of
these
airboats
could've
navigated
those
waters
as
well.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
correct,
he
did.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
might
be
appropriate
at
this
time
to
refer
to
this
map
which
i've
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute.
the
think
black
outline,
the
thick
line
running
around
the
periphery
of
the
lake
is
the
4,200
foot
line,
it's
a
contour
map,
is
approximately,
slightly
less,
but
approximately
with
the
level
that
the
lake
was
at
statehood.
the
thick
blue
line
is
approximately
the
level
that
the
state,
that
the
lake
is
today,
again,
somewhat
less.
the
white
areas
then,
between
the
blue
line
and
the
black
line
are
areas
which
have
been
exposed.
there
is
a
--
since
the
time
of
statehood,
there
is
a
five-foot
vertical
difference
involved
between
those
two
lines.
so
that
i
think
one
can
say
that
the
waters
to
which
the
master
was
referring
in
the
passage
which
you
have
read
are
the
waters
within
the
blue
line
and
it
can
be
seen
that
indeed
those
waters
do
run
virtually
from
the
northern
tip
of
the
lake,
to
virtually
the
southern
tip
of
the
lake.
i
think
it
can
also
be
seen,
however,
that
along
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
the
lake
as
the
master
also
specifically
found,
in
particular
behind
stansbury
island
and
carrington
island
in
the
lower
left,
and
the
whole
of
the
bear
river
bay
and
then
farmington
bay
along
the
right,
that
there
is
a
very
wide
expanse
of
land
which
has
been
exposed.
now,
to
give
you
some
notion
of
the
extent
of
that
land
while
the
vertical
scale
here
is
five
feet
between
the
lines.
the
horizontal
scale
is
eight
feet
to
the
inch
or
each
one
eighth
of
an
inch
represents
one
mile
in
horizontal
dimension.
i
think
the
court
will
see
that
there
are
considerable
extents
of
water
exposed
--
of
land
exposed
around
the
edge,
where
that
horizontal
scale
is
a
quarter
of
an
inch
or
greater.
or
in
other
words,
where
something
on
the
order
of
--
takes
something
on
the
order
of
only
a
two-foot
difference
in
depth
over
the
course
of
a
mile's
horizontal
distance
and
this
is
basically
where
the
argument
in
the
case
rests.
it's
true,
one
can
go
from
one
carefully
selected
point
on
the
lake
to
another
carefully
selected
point
on
the
lake,
but
this
is
a
lake
and
not
a
river.
with
a
river,
one
is
only
concerned
with
traveling
the
length
of
the
river.
crossing
the
river
is
never
a
very
great
concern
so
far
as
navigability
is
--
when
navigability
is
an
issue
and
has
never
been
at
issue
in
this
court's
cases.
but
we
don't
think
a
lake
is
very
useful
for
commerce,
when
you
can't
get
out
of
the
lake
to
any
place
else
and
when
you
can
only
visit
one
or
two
places
upon
its
shores,
that
in
essence
is
the
contention
of
the
united
states
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
has
to
be
substantially
useful.
there
has
to
be
a
practical
and
permanent
capacity
for
commerce.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
comes
well
within
the
bounds
of
the
united
states'
argument
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
its
natural
condition,
there
is
a
capacity
for
commerce
only
between
that
point
on
the
southern
shore,
that
point
of
the
northern
tip,
and
a
few
of
the
islands
are
now
in
a
lake,
an
enormous
body
of
water
of
this
sort,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
navigability.
of
course,
any
boat
could
float
on
the
waters
of
this
lake
if
one
could
--
wants
to
get
there.
but
issue
onto
this
court's
cases
is
whether
anyone
would
have
wished
to
put
a
boat
there
for
commercial
purposes
and
the
cases
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
previously
with
some
minor
exceptions
of
the
prior
utah
decision
is
one
of
them.
the
court
has
been
concerned
with
the
great
web
of
rivers
and
lakes
which
makes
up
the
mississippi
valley
and
the
watershed
of
the
great
lakes.
and
there
really
has
been
no
question
but
that
if
a
body
of
water
connected
into
those
bodies
it
would
have
been
useful
and
would
have
been
used.
now,
there
have
been
decisions
such
as
the
prior
utah
decision
which
involved
segments
of
water,
disconnected
segments
of
water,
and
considered
whether
or
not
they
were
navigable,
but
i
should
point
out
there,
that
those
bodies
of
water
were
in
remote
and
unexplored
situations,
settlements
had
not
grown
up.
in
essence,
commercial
use
had
not
begun
and
the
court
was
very
careful
in
those
cases
to
say,
that
it
was
reaching
its
conclusion
about
navigability
in
part
because
the
non-use
of
the
waterway
for
commercial
purposes
could
be
explained
by
the
absence
of
people,
by
the
absence
of
development.
we
don't
have
any
such
explanation
here.
there
were
200,000
people
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
this
lake
on
the
day
of
statehood.
there
are
500,000
people
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
this
lake
today
and
yet
it
is
not
used
for
commerce.
it
cannot
be
used
for
commerce
without
the
improvements
of
such
a
massive
scope
as
to
make
it
clear
that
in
its
natural
and
ordinary
conditions
it
is
not
susceptible
of
commercial
use.
in
these
areas,
we've
been
talking
about
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
hmm?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
being
heavily
polluted,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
it
comes
from
the
court's
decision
in
the
jonas
chief
and
the
daniel
ball.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
essentially.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don't
--
i
would
not
say
that
--
i
don't
think
that
i
would
want
to
or
that
i
have
to
take
that
argument
to
a
complete,
to
a
complete
extreme,
but
i
do
think
again,
that
on
a
historical
view,
these
lands,
or
these
waters
rather
were
important
because
they
provided
a
means
for
goods
and
people
to
get
from
place
to
place.
in
way
which
would
otherwise
not
be
--
there
would
otherwise
be
no
convenient
way
to
do
it.
the
great
salt
lake
provides
no
such
facility.
now,
the
court
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
would
have
to
take
it
down
to
--
i
suppose,
what
may
be
a
somewhat
more
prosaic,
somewhat
more
prosaic
description
one
may
also
imagine
an
island
which
is
being
used
for
farming
purposes
as
there
are
in
this
lake,
which
is
surrounded
by
a
body
of
water,
which
is
not
navigable.
let
us
say,
if
you
are
thinking
about
boats
passing
from
the
top
of
the
river
on
down
to
some
port
in
the
bottom
part,
and
yet,
the
family
that
farms
the
island
has
to
get
out
there
and
they
have
a
boat
to
do
it
and
they
row
out
and
they
row
back.
the
river
to
them
is
this
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
bring
their
products
out
and
back,
of
course
they
do.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
being
used
for
transportation
of
goods
being
taken
to
market,
but
i
do
feel
that
the
court's
cases
have
been
concerned
with
commercial
use
in
a
broader
sense
as
in
--
it
might
so
well
as,
be
a
marsh,
be
a
swamp,
the
one
of
these
areas
which
is
passable
only
by
airboat.
the
court
has
in
the
past
dealt
with
situations
of
such
marginal
navigability
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
in
the
utah
case
they
have
always
been
careful
to
be
sure
that
such
uses
were
taken
as
evidence
and
that
the
lake
might
be
susceptible
of
commercial
use
but
one
looked
to
see
whether
ultimately
it
would
become
a
public
highway
not
a
private
road.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of
it
but
i'm
--
i
will
say
that
they
are
--
there
are
certainly
are
cases
which
have
held
that
that
was
one
use
that
showed
that
it
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
no,
it
--
there's
a
very
fine
distinction,
but
it
really
comes
to
the
point
that
the
individual
is
--
has
a
choice
about
what
means
of
transportation
is
going
to
employ
and
here
is
a
body
of
water,
and
he
chooses
the
body
of
water
because
of
its
convenient.
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
for
example,
one
had
a
lake
three
to
six
feet
deep
and
the
court
quite
carefully
observed,
well,
there
weren't
many
people
who
use
this
lake
but
really
waterways
were
the
established,
the
most
convenient
means
of
going
from
place
to
place.
it
wasn't
that
the
waterway
was
an
obstacle
naturally
in
this
path
which
somehow
had
to
be
surmounted.
of
course,
if
the
fact
that
the
waterway
is
there
and
has
to
be
gotten
passed
in
order
to
mine
the
island
or
do
the
farming
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
it's
navigable.
why
then,
we
are
out
of
court
and
that
the
report
of
the
master
ought
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
a
substantial
or
permanent
commercial
use
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
and
goods.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
be
sure,
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
i
believe.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
again,
i
would
say
that
in
this
particular
circumstance,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
lake
and
not
a
river
seems
to
us
of
some
significance
that
one
has
to
deal
with
the
whole
of
the
circumference
and
not
simply
a
matter
of
length
of
travel.
there
is
another
issue
of
degree
that
is
involved
here
and
that
is
the
question
of
dredging
harbors
or
building
piers.
one
couldn't
deny
that
in
every
harbor
there
must
be
some
dredging
done,
there
some
piers
built,
but
in
substantial
areas
of
the
shore
of
this
lake,
a
pier
would
have
to
be
miles
long
just
to
be
sure
of
having
foot
of
water
at
one
end
and
dry
land
at
the
other
end.
and
when
it
comes
to
building
improvements
of
that
kind,
i
think,
one
can
say
that
the
waterway
in
its
natural
condition
is
not
usable.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
they
are.
they
have
cities
employing
millions.
they
have
countless
boats
flying
their
shores.
united
states
sought
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
in
the
proceedings
before
the
master
of
commerce
on
other
inland
land
locked
lakes
in
this
country
that
offer
of
proof
was
refused.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
susceptible
and
capable
of
bearing
navigation,
but
in
the
sense
that
one
may
expect
that
navigation
to
be
there
that
has
some
permanent
and
substantial
use
as
this
court
has
put
it.
the
great
lakes
miles,
excuse
me,
the
great
lakes'
shores,
do
not
change
by
one
or
two
miles
every
season.
they
do
not
change
by
four
or
five
miles
over
the
course
of
eight
years
in
time
as
the
lakes
of
the
great
salt
lake
do.
it
is
possible
to
build
permanent
improvements
there
of
a
very
much
lesser
extent
that
makes
enables
one
to
use
it.
there
is
a
much
greater
extent
of
shore
line,
much
greater
distance
that
one
can
go.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
have
not
accepted
it
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
and
so
we
do
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
we
do
explain
--
we
do
explain
those
uses
in
the
brief
before
the
special
master
which
is
now
before
this
court
and
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
many
of
them
occurred
during
periods
of
time
when
the
lake
was
much
higher
than
it
is
now.
but
of
course
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
was
much
higher
than
it
was
in
1896.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
excuse
me,
i
misspoke.
the
boats
were
used
at
time
when
it
was
higher
than
it
was
in
1896,
is
what
i
meant
to
say.
excuse
me.
and
we
do
not
question
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
couldn't
have
lived
and
worked
on
antelope
island
unless
they
could
get
from
the
island
to
the
shores.
the
fact
that
they
went
through
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
with
their
products,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
with
their
livestock.
it
may
be
that
what
we
are
suggesting
in
some
respects
to
go
back
to
the
utah
case
and
the
prior
utah
case,
the
court
held
that
part
of
the
colorado
river
was
navigable
and
part
of
the
colorado
was
not
navigable.
it
is
perhaps
a
harder
operation
to
do
with
a
lake
than
it
is
to
do
with
a
river,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
quality
of
the
shores
of
this
lake
along
the
eastern
side,
along
the
western
side,
in
bear
river
bay,
there
are
those
areas
which
are
so
shallow
and
have
been
so
shallow
for
such
a
long
period
of
time,
that
one
may
say,
at
least
there
that
there
is
no
susceptibility
of
use
for
navigation
in
the
natural
sense.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
so
i'll
leave
our
second
argument
to
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
only
say
very
briefly
while
it's
evident
that
this
is
the
best
of
close
case
for
united
states.
still,
i
think,
the
great
salt
lake
is
distinguishable.
it's
a
matter
of
proportion
in
the
atlantic
ocean
or
some
similar
systems.
this
is
lake
which
is
only
80
miles
in
its
maximum
dimension
and
to
use
it
in
most
places
you
must
build
a
pier
or
dig
a
channel
that
is
mile-and-a-half
or
two-and-a-half
miles
long
then
i
suggest
that
that
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
lake
is
not
useful
in
its
ordinary
condition
as
a
highway
of
commerce.
the
passage
in
the
utah
case
which
to
which
counsel
referred,
which
did
make
reference
to
private
uses
went
on
to
say,
that
it
did
so
because
conditions
of
exploration
and
settlement
explain
the
infrequency
or
limited
nature
of
the
use
and
now,
the
great
salt
lake
has
no
such
excuse.
it
was
well
settled
at
the
time.
it
is
well
settled
now.
it
has
never
had
any
permanent
use
for
the
transportation
of
goods
or
passengers
from
place
to
place
except
in
those
few
situations
where
it
was
rendered
absolutely
necessary
by
the
geography
of
the
situation.
transportation
on
the
lake
has
never
been
a
matter
of
choice.
if
i
may
just
one
technical
matter,
if
it
please
the
court,
my
search
of
the
records
did
reveal
that
you
have
no
copy
of
the
transcript.
this
is
our
copy
of
the
transcript
which
i
believe
is
unmarked.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
which
was
brought
by
the
state
of
utah
under
authority
granted
by
the
congress
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
or
utah
prior
to
a
quitclaim
deed
given
by
the
united
states,
had
title
to
the
lands
lying
below
the
meander
line
of
the
great
salt
lake
which
is
a
shallow
and
very
salty
body
of
water
of
some
size
lying
wholly
within
the
state
of
utah
in
its
northern
portion.
after
a
variety
of
procedural
rulings
which
i
need
not
to
remind
the
court
of.
the
case
was
referred
to
special
master,
the
honorable
j.
cullen
ganey
to
report
to
this
court
on
the
issue
of
the
title.
that
issue
has
several
aspects
and
then
the
proceedings
immediately
had
had,
he
decided
only
one
of
those
which
is
whether
the
great
salt
lake
was
a
navigable
body
of
water
on
the
day
when
utah
became
a
state,
january
4,
1896.
and
the
parties
have
fully
agreed
that
if
the
great
salt
lake
was
not
navigable
on
that
day,
then
the
united
states
continued
its
ownership
of
all
the
lands
below
the
meander
line
and
in
that
situation,
further
proceedings
will
eventually
be
required
to
determine
if
the
market
value
of
the
lands
which
have
subsequently
been
quickclaimed
to
utah,
so
that
utah
may
pay
that
value
for
the
quitclaim
deed.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
great
salt
lake
was
navigable
on
that
day
in
january
1896
then
the
lake
that
passed
to
utah
at
that
time,
instant
as
part
of
the
operation
of
the
principle
of
equal
footing
or
equality
among
the
states,
then
is
no
necessity
for
utah
to
pay
for
lands
which
were
within
the
boundaries
of
the
lake
as
they
existed
on
that
day,
save
possibly
for
such
lands
as
have
been
since
relicted
by
the
recession
of
the
lake
from
its
shores.
and
the
issues
where
the
boundaries
of
the
lake
were
on
january
4,
1896
and
whether
the
united
states
continued
entitle
or
obtain
title
to
such
lands
as
might
have
relicted
after
that
date,
again,
is
an
issue
which
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
and
which
would
have
to
be
decided
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
if
the
court
should
rule
for
utah
in
the
present
proceedings.
and
i
might
just
very
briefly
remark
in
that
connection,
that
while
the
report
of
the
special
master
is
in
some
minor
respect
possibly
seems
to
rule
on
the
reliction
issue
on
the
one
hand
in
conclusion
of
law
18
or
in
the
proposed
decree
to
state
that
if
the
lake
was
navigable,
utah
obtained
titles
to
all
lands
within
the
meander
line,
i
think
it
is
clear
and
that
counsel
for
utah
will
agree
that
the
issues
are
as
i
have
stated.
the
question
of
reliction
remains
open
for
future
decision
and
if
the
lake
was
navigable
on
january
4th,
the
lands
which
utah
took
at
that
time
were
the
lands
which
were
under
the
lake's
waters
at
that
time
and
not
the
lands
which
might
have
happen
to
be
within
the
meander
line
which
had
been
drawn
at
some
earlier
time.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
it's
question
of
construction,
indeed
whether
the
decree
is
inconsistent.
if
it
is
susceptible
to
a
reading
then
it's
inconsistent
with
what
i've
stated.
this
court
has
always
followed
the
practice
in
past
of
inviting
proposals
for
decree
after
original
cases
and
i
--
we
have
been
assuming
it
would
do
so
in
this
case
then
we
can
confront
the
question
at
that
time.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
issue
which
is
here
as
i've
said,
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
great
salt
lake
was
navigable
on
the
day
that
utah
became
a
state.
there
were
hearings
in
salt
lake
city
before
the
master.
both
oral
testimony
and
numerous
documents
were
produced
and
on
that
basis,
the
special
master
has
prepared
a
lengthy
report
in
which
he
concludes
that
the
lake
is
navigable.
and
while
we
dispute
that
final
conclusion,
i
should
make
it
clear
as
i
think
our
brief
does
that
on
the
whole
we
acknowledge
that
the
report
is
correct
and
the
statement
to
the
fact
strictly
speaking
of
the
case
we
think
the
master
has
done
an
excellent
job
and
don't
mean
by
arguing
legal
points
here
to
suggest
otherwise.
we
accept
all
the
strictly
factual
findings
made
in
the
report
and
have
made
exceptions
only
the
findings
of
law
and
to
two
of
the
findings
of
fact
which
in
our
view,
embody
essentially
mixed
questions
of
law
and
of
fact.
we
contend
that
the
lake
was
not
navigable
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
lake
presents
such
obstacles
to
navigation
in
its
natural
state
that
it
could
never
be
used
as
a
channel
of
useful
commerce
and
trade
by
water
without
improvements
of
an
unusual
extent
being
made.
and
the
second
is
that
even
if
the
lake
were
navigable,
in
fact,
it
lacks
any
connection
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
trade
and
for
that
reason,
it
should
be
found
not
navigable
in
law.
taking
up
the
question
of
navigability
in
fact
again,
the
parties
are
largely
in
agreement
of
what
the
underlying
law
is.
the
proper
test
was
first
stated
by
this
court
in
the
daniel
ball
in
10
wallace
and
the
court
said
there
that
waters
are
navigable,
in
fact,
when
they
are
used
or
are
susceptible
of
being
used
in
their
ordinary
condition
as
highways
for
commerce
over
which
trade
and
travel
are
or
maybe
conducted
in
the
customary
mode
of
trade
and
travel
on
water.
and
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
the
principal
dispute
here
is
what
that
word
susceptible
means.
perhaps,
some
argument
about
the
extent
to
which
improvements
may
occur
without
departing
from
the
ordinary
conditions
of
waters.
and
what
the
court
meant
when
it
said,
that
they
must
be
useful
as
highways
for
commerce.
the
master
did
not
find
that
the
great
salt
lake
was
actually
in
use
as
a
highway
for
commerce
on
january
4,
1896.
he
found
only
that
it
was
capable
or
susceptible
of
such
use.
not
counting
excursion
trips
which
have
been
made
he
found
the
boating
uses
of
the
lake
have
been
more
of
a
private
nature
rather
than
by
individual
contractors
for
hire,
that's
finding
of
fact
51.
in
finding
of
fact
52,
he's
found
no
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
ever
any
regularly
scheduled
freight
or
passenger
service
operated
on
the
lake.
so,
the
question
is
whether
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
this
lake
in
its
ordinary
natural
condition
could
become
a
highway
of
commerce.
the
master's
report
on
the
whole
is
a
discussion
of
that
question.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
--
he
found
that
on
that
date,
the
lake
was
approximately
77
miles
long
and
taking
its
greatest
length
about
33
miles
wide
and
exposed
approximately
100
and
--
excuse
me,
15,000
square
miles
of
water
and
to
the
sun.
that
its
elevation,
there
is
some
confusion,
i
think
there's
a
typographical
error
at
one
point
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
he
found
that
its
elevation
at
statehood
was
4,201
feet
which
would
give
it,
at
its
greatest
depth,
the
depth
of
30
feet,
an
average
depth
of
13
feet.
we
have
submitted
to
the
clerk
and
to
counsel
and
asked
him
to
distribute
to
you
a
small
map
of
the
lake
to
which
i'll
be
referring
later
on
in
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
oh.
well
basically,
perhaps
the
simplest
way
to
answer
it
would
be
to
refer
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
montello
which
involved
the
fox
river.
the
fox
river
was
a
body
river
which
had
water
--
which
had
existed
in
nature.
would
transport
boats
of
two-and-a-half
foot
depths
down
it
for
a
considerable
distance,
although,
there
was
some
rapids
and
riffles
to
be
gone
through.
it
had
been
improved
by
the
time
a
case
got
to
this
court,
questioning
whether
it
was
a
navigable
waterway
or
not.
and
in
deciding
whether
it
was
a
navigable
waterway,
the
court
said,
“we
will
not
concern
ourselves
with
those
improvements,
with
those
canals,
ditches,
locks
and
so
forth,
but
rather
with
the
river
as
it
was
when
man
found
it,
unimproved,
unexcavated,
entrenched”
and
the
issue
was
whether
in
those
circumstances,
it
could
carry
trade
and
commerce
and
the
court
found
that
these
boats
of
two-and-a-half
foot
depths
carrying
substantial
loads
of
lumber
and
other
goods,
in
fact,
frequently
ran
the
river
engaging
in
commerce
of
a
very
substantial
sort
on
it.
and
so
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right,
mr.
justice
douglas.
thankfully,
again,
1896
perhaps
is
helpful
to
us
in
that
respect
that
it's
quite
clear
from
the
cases
that
the
question
of
navigation
is
with
the
means
of
navigation
which
were
available
at
the
time
and
i
don't
believe
that
an
airboat
would
have
been
available
in
1896.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
it
is.
i
think
it
may
also
be
--
i
think
another
appropriate
response
to
that
of
course
one
has
today
amphibious
trucks
of
enormous
dimension
and
hovercraft
and
the
like.
virtually
no
case
which
this
court
has
decided
would
not
involve
a
body
of
water
which
couldn't
be
navigated
by
one
or
another
of
those
crafts.
the
united
states
versus
oregon,
for
example,
the
waters
in
those
lakes
were
in
some
places
only
inches
deep.
quite
plainly,
one
of
these
airboats
could've
navigated
those
waters
as
well.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
correct,
he
did.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
might
be
appropriate
at
this
time
to
refer
to
this
map
which
i've
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute.
the
think
black
outline,
the
thick
line
running
around
the
periphery
of
the
lake
is
the
4,200
foot
line,
it's
a
contour
map,
is
approximately,
slightly
less,
but
approximately
with
the
level
that
the
lake
was
at
statehood.
the
thick
blue
line
is
approximately
the
level
that
the
state,
that
the
lake
is
today,
again,
somewhat
less.
the
white
areas
then,
between
the
blue
line
and
the
black
line
are
areas
which
have
been
exposed.
there
is
a
--
since
the
time
of
statehood,
there
is
a
five-foot
vertical
difference
involved
between
those
two
lines.
so
that
i
think
one
can
say
that
the
waters
to
which
the
master
was
referring
in
the
passage
which
you
have
read
are
the
waters
within
the
blue
line
and
it
can
be
seen
that
indeed
those
waters
do
run
virtually
from
the
northern
tip
of
the
lake,
to
virtually
the
southern
tip
of
the
lake.
i
think
it
can
also
be
seen,
however,
that
along
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
the
lake
as
the
master
also
specifically
found,
in
particular
behind
stansbury
island
and
carrington
island
in
the
lower
left,
and
the
whole
of
the
bear
river
bay
and
then
farmington
bay
along
the
right,
that
there
is
a
very
wide
expanse
of
land
which
has
been
exposed.
now,
to
give
you
some
notion
of
the
extent
of
that
land
while
the
vertical
scale
here
is
five
feet
between
the
lines.
the
horizontal
scale
is
eight
feet
to
the
inch
or
each
one
eighth
of
an
inch
represents
one
mile
in
horizontal
dimension.
i
think
the
court
will
see
that
there
are
considerable
extents
of
water
exposed
--
of
land
exposed
around
the
edge,
where
that
horizontal
scale
is
a
quarter
of
an
inch
or
greater.
or
in
other
words,
where
something
on
the
order
of
--
takes
something
on
the
order
of
only
a
two-foot
difference
in
depth
over
the
course
of
a
mile's
horizontal
distance
and
this
is
basically
where
the
argument
in
the
case
rests.
it's
true,
one
can
go
from
one
carefully
selected
point
on
the
lake
to
another
carefully
selected
point
on
the
lake,
but
this
is
a
lake
and
not
a
river.
with
a
river,
one
is
only
concerned
with
traveling
the
length
of
the
river.
crossing
the
river
is
never
a
very
great
concern
so
far
as
navigability
is
--
when
navigability
is
an
issue
and
has
never
been
at
issue
in
this
court's
cases.
but
we
don't
think
a
lake
is
very
useful
for
commerce,
when
you
can't
get
out
of
the
lake
to
any
place
else
and
when
you
can
only
visit
one
or
two
places
upon
its
shores,
that
in
essence
is
the
contention
of
the
united
states
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
has
to
be
substantially
useful.
there
has
to
be
a
practical
and
permanent
capacity
for
commerce.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
comes
well
within
the
bounds
of
the
united
states'
argument
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
its
natural
condition,
there
is
a
capacity
for
commerce
only
between
that
point
on
the
southern
shore,
that
point
of
the
northern
tip,
and
a
few
of
the
islands
are
now
in
a
lake,
an
enormous
body
of
water
of
this
sort,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
navigability.
of
course,
any
boat
could
float
on
the
waters
of
this
lake
if
one
could
--
wants
to
get
there.
but
issue
onto
this
court's
cases
is
whether
anyone
would
have
wished
to
put
a
boat
there
for
commercial
purposes
and
the
cases
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
previously
with
some
minor
exceptions
of
the
prior
utah
decision
is
one
of
them.
the
court
has
been
concerned
with
the
great
web
of
rivers
and
lakes
which
makes
up
the
mississippi
valley
and
the
watershed
of
the
great
lakes.
and
there
really
has
been
no
question
but
that
if
a
body
of
water
connected
into
those
bodies
it
would
have
been
useful
and
would
have
been
used.
now,
there
have
been
decisions
such
as
the
prior
utah
decision
which
involved
segments
of
water,
disconnected
segments
of
water,
and
considered
whether
or
not
they
were
navigable,
but
i
should
point
out
there,
that
those
bodies
of
water
were
in
remote
and
unexplored
situations,
settlements
had
not
grown
up.
in
essence,
commercial
use
had
not
begun
and
the
court
was
very
careful
in
those
cases
to
say,
that
it
was
reaching
its
conclusion
about
navigability
in
part
because
the
non-use
of
the
waterway
for
commercial
purposes
could
be
explained
by
the
absence
of
people,
by
the
absence
of
development.
we
don't
have
any
such
explanation
here.
there
were
200,000
people
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
this
lake
on
the
day
of
statehood.
there
are
500,000
people
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
this
lake
today
and
yet
it
is
not
used
for
commerce.
it
cannot
be
used
for
commerce
without
the
improvements
of
such
a
massive
scope
as
to
make
it
clear
that
in
its
natural
and
ordinary
conditions
it
is
not
susceptible
of
commercial
use.
in
these
areas,
we've
been
talking
about
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
hmm?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
being
heavily
polluted,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
it
comes
from
the
court's
decision
in
the
jonas
chief
and
the
daniel
ball.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
essentially.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don't
--
i
would
not
say
that
--
i
don't
think
that
i
would
want
to
or
that
i
have
to
take
that
argument
to
a
complete,
to
a
complete
extreme,
but
i
do
think
again,
that
on
a
historical
view,
these
lands,
or
these
waters
rather
were
important
because
they
provided
a
means
for
goods
and
people
to
get
from
place
to
place.
in
way
which
would
otherwise
not
be
--
there
would
otherwise
be
no
convenient
way
to
do
it.
the
great
salt
lake
provides
no
such
facility.
now,
the
court
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
would
have
to
take
it
down
to
--
i
suppose,
what
may
be
a
somewhat
more
prosaic,
somewhat
more
prosaic
description
one
may
also
imagine
an
island
which
is
being
used
for
farming
purposes
as
there
are
in
this
lake,
which
is
surrounded
by
a
body
of
water,
which
is
not
navigable.
let
us
say,
if
you
are
thinking
about
boats
passing
from
the
top
of
the
river
on
down
to
some
port
in
the
bottom
part,
and
yet,
the
family
that
farms
the
island
has
to
get
out
there
and
they
have
a
boat
to
do
it
and
they
row
out
and
they
row
back.
the
river
to
them
is
this
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
bring
their
products
out
and
back,
of
course
they
do.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
being
used
for
transportation
of
goods
being
taken
to
market,
but
i
do
feel
that
the
court's
cases
have
been
concerned
with
commercial
use
in
a
broader
sense
as
in
--
it
might
so
well
as,
be
a
marsh,
be
a
swamp,
the
one
of
these
areas
which
is
passable
only
by
airboat.
the
court
has
in
the
past
dealt
with
situations
of
such
marginal
navigability
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
in
the
utah
case
they
have
always
been
careful
to
be
sure
that
such
uses
were
taken
as
evidence
and
that
the
lake
might
be
susceptible
of
commercial
use
but
one
looked
to
see
whether
ultimately
it
would
become
a
public
highway
not
a
private
road.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of
it
but
i'm
--
i
will
say
that
they
are
--
there
are
certainly
are
cases
which
have
held
that
that
was
one
use
that
showed
that
it
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
no,
it
--
there's
a
very
fine
distinction,
but
it
really
comes
to
the
point
that
the
individual
is
--
has
a
choice
about
what
means
of
transportation
is
going
to
employ
and
here
is
a
body
of
water,
and
he
chooses
the
body
of
water
because
of
its
convenient.
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
for
example,
one
had
a
lake
three
to
six
feet
deep
and
the
court
quite
carefully
observed,
well,
there
weren't
many
people
who
use
this
lake
but
really
waterways
were
the
established,
the
most
convenient
means
of
going
from
place
to
place.
it
wasn't
that
the
waterway
was
an
obstacle
naturally
in
this
path
which
somehow
had
to
be
surmounted.
of
course,
if
the
fact
that
the
waterway
is
there
and
has
to
be
gotten
passed
in
order
to
mine
the
island
or
do
the
farming
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
it's
navigable.
why
then,
we
are
out
of
court
and
that
the
report
of
the
master
ought
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
a
substantial
or
permanent
commercial
use
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
and
goods.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
be
sure,
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
i
believe.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
again,
i
would
say
that
in
this
particular
circumstance,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
lake
and
not
a
river
seems
to
us
of
some
significance
that
one
has
to
deal
with
the
whole
of
the
circumference
and
not
simply
a
matter
of
length
of
travel.
there
is
another
issue
of
degree
that
is
involved
here
and
that
is
the
question
of
dredging
harbors
or
building
piers.
one
couldn't
deny
that
in
every
harbor
there
must
be
some
dredging
done,
there
some
piers
built,
but
in
substantial
areas
of
the
shore
of
this
lake,
a
pier
would
have
to
be
miles
long
just
to
be
sure
of
having
foot
of
water
at
one
end
and
dry
land
at
the
other
end.
and
when
it
comes
to
building
improvements
of
that
kind,
i
think,
one
can
say
that
the
waterway
in
its
natural
condition
is
not
usable.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
they
are.
they
have
cities
employing
millions.
they
have
countless
boats
flying
their
shores.
united
states
sought
to
make
an
offer
of
proof
in
the
proceedings
before
the
master
of
commerce
on
other
inland
land
locked
lakes
in
this
country
that
offer
of
proof
was
refused.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
susceptible
and
capable
of
bearing
navigation,
but
in
the
sense
that
one
may
expect
that
navigation
to
be
there
that
has
some
permanent
and
substantial
use
as
this
court
has
put
it.
the
great
lakes
miles,
excuse
me,
the
great
lakes'
shores,
do
not
change
by
one
or
two
miles
every
season.
they
do
not
change
by
four
or
five
miles
over
the
course
of
eight
years
in
time
as
the
lakes
of
the
great
salt
lake
do.
it
is
possible
to
build
permanent
improvements
there
of
a
very
much
lesser
extent
that
makes
enables
one
to
use
it.
there
is
a
much
greater
extent
of
shore
line,
much
greater
distance
that
one
can
go.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
have
not
accepted
it
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
and
so
we
do
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
we
do
explain
--
we
do
explain
those
uses
in
the
brief
before
the
special
master
which
is
now
before
this
court
and
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
many
of
them
occurred
during
periods
of
time
when
the
lake
was
much
higher
than
it
is
now.
but
of
course
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
was
much
higher
than
it
was
in
1896.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
excuse
me,
i
misspoke.
the
boats
were
used
at
time
when
it
was
higher
than
it
was
in
1896,
is
what
i
meant
to
say.
excuse
me.
and
we
do
not
question
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
couldn't
have
lived
and
worked
on
antelope
island
unless
they
could
get
from
the
island
to
the
shores.
the
fact
that
they
went
through
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
with
their
products,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
with
their
livestock.
it
may
be
that
what
we
are
suggesting
in
some
respects
to
go
back
to
the
utah
case
and
the
prior
utah
case,
the
court
held
that
part
of
the
colorado
river
was
navigable
and
part
of
the
colorado
was
not
navigable.
it
is
perhaps
a
harder
operation
to
do
with
a
lake
than
it
is
to
do
with
a
river,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
quality
of
the
shores
of
this
lake
along
the
eastern
side,
along
the
western
side,
in
bear
river
bay,
there
are
those
areas
which
are
so
shallow
and
have
been
so
shallow
for
such
a
long
period
of
time,
that
one
may
say,
at
least
there
that
there
is
no
susceptibility
of
use
for
navigation
in
the
natural
sense.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
so
i'll
leave
our
second
argument
to
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
only
say
very
briefly
while
it's
evident
that
this
is
the
best
of
close
case
for
united
states.
still,
i
think,
the
great
salt
lake
is
distinguishable.
it's
a
matter
of
proportion
in
the
atlantic
ocean
or
some
similar
systems.
this
is
lake
which
is
only
80
miles
in
its
maximum
dimension
and
to
use
it
in
most
places
you
must
build
a
pier
or
dig
a
channel
that
is
mile-and-a-half
or
two-and-a-half
miles
long
then
i
suggest
that
that
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
lake
is
not
useful
in
its
ordinary
condition
as
a
highway
of
commerce.
the
passage
in
the
utah
case
which
to
which
counsel
referred,
which
did
make
reference
to
private
uses
went
on
to
say,
that
it
did
so
because
conditions
of
exploration
and
settlement
explain
the
infrequency
or
limited
nature
of
the
use
and
now,
the
great
salt
lake
has
no
such
excuse.
it
was
well
settled
at
the
time.
it
is
well
settled
now.
it
has
never
had
any
permanent
use
for
the
transportation
of
goods
or
passengers
from
place
to
place
except
in
those
few
situations
where
it
was
rendered
absolutely
necessary
by
the
geography
of
the
situation.
transportation
on
the
lake
has
never
been
a
matter
of
choice.
if
i
may
just
one
technical
matter,
if
it
please
the
court,
my
search
of
the
records
did
reveal
that
you
have
no
copy
of
the
transcript.
this
is
our
copy
of
the
transcript
which
i
believe
is
unmarked.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
