mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
that
utah
does
agree
that
the
issue
of
reliction
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time,
that
the
question
is
one
of
navigability.
utah
further
agrees
that
in
order
for
the
great
salt
lake
to
be
found
navigable
in
january
4,
1896,
it
must
have
been
navigable
in
its
natural
and
ordinary
condition.
we
submit
that
the
master
so
found.
we
disagree
with
the
united
states
in
the
interpretation
of
this
language
of
susceptibility.
we
believe
it
to
be
clear
on
the
court's
language
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank,
united
states
versus
utah,
that
actual
use
at
statehood
is
not
required.
it
is
a
capacity
for
use.
we
believe,
we
showed
a
great
deal
more
than
a
naked
physical
capacity,
but
we
believe
that
that
is
all
that
was
necessary.
that
is
does
the
body
of
water
have
sufficient
length,
width,
depth.
is
it
dependable?
is
it
there
year
in,
year
out?
all
seasons
of
the
year?
could
it
be
used
if
the
need
arises?
in
fact
in
the
holt
state
bank
case,
the
evidence
was
that
mud
lake
as
it
was
called,
only
enjoined
--
enjoyed
a
very
limited
historical
use
and
at
the
time
of
trial
was
drained
and
dry.
it
had
absolutely
no
future.
consequently,
any
discussion
as
to
what
the
future
may
hold
as
far
as
a
build
up
of
a
commerce
with
boats
going
everywhere
on
the
lake
at
various
points
is
simply
irrelevant.
title
either
vested
on
january
4,
1896
in
utah
or
it
didn't.
it
has
been
floating,
waiting
for
experience
to
show
what
the
traffic
will
be
on
the
lake.
this
is
why
the
court
has
used
and
correctly
so
the
very
definitive
test
of
susceptibility.
secondly,
we
believe
that
of
course,
the
actual
uses
demonstrate
a
susceptibility
very
well.
the
master
found
a
variety
of
uses.
he
found
the
great
many
different
kinds
of
boats
that
have
been
used
on
the
lake
both
before
and
after
statehood.
it's
true,
some
were
used
for
pleasure,
but
it's
also
true,
some
were
used
in
business.
and
again
in
united
states
versus
utah,
this
court
said
that
no
matter
what
they
use,
it
is
still
relevant
to
show
the
susceptibility.
the
united
states
in
the
earlier
case
made
the
very
argument,
it's
making
here
that
well
too
many
of
these
uses
are
private
in
nature
as
opposed
to
being
paid
for.
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
turning
to
the
argument
that
there
is
no
access
to
the
like,
that
it
is
too
difficult
to
get
to,
so
that
the
otherwise
usable
capacity
is
made
useless.
i
would
first
refer
to
the
map
which
counsel
has
submitted
to
the
court
and
point
out
that
the
special
master
found
that
antelope
island
had
been
continuously
inhabited
since
1848
and
the
witness
which
was
spoken
of
earlier,
zela
walker
manning
testified
that
she
was
born
on
that
island
in
the
early
1890's,
lived
there
and
that
her
testimony
was
that
boats
were
used
to
transport
livestock,
household
supplies,
grain,
farm
equipment.
this
is
across
the
very
area
which
the
united
states
says
its
too
shallow
to
navigate
and
that
you
can't
get
your
boat
to
the
shore
or
off
in
the
shore.
the
same
as
true
of
freemont
island.
it
has
sustained
a
viable
livestock
industry.
further
as
has
already
been
noted,
there
are
a
number
of
places
on
the
lake
where
the
bed
is
deep.
we
don't
deny
that
there
some
pretty
flat
shores
there
and
that
there
are
some
bogs,
but
again,
we
don't
believe
unlimited
capacity
is
a
requirement
that
you
have
to
be
able
to
get
in
at
every
spot.
again,
in
united
states
versus
utah,
this
court
observed
that
the
65
miles
of
the
colorado
river
which
it
found
to
be
navigable
flowed
through
rock
canyons
for
a
large
extent
that
had
walls
from
600
to
1,200
feet
in
height.
in
the
mud
lake
case,
the
court
concluded
that
that
lake
was
navigable
even
though
sand
bars
prevented
the
unrestricted
use
of
the
lake
and
here,
the
special
master
found
that
the
shallow
waters
which
are
around
the
shore
could
easily
be
avoided
by
keeping
into
the
navigable
channels
which
he
had
found
extended
substantially
throughout
the
length
and
width
of
the
lake.
the
point
is
that
if
someone
needs
to
build
a
pier
or
build
a
harbor,
there
are
some
good
spots
to
build
them.
this
is
not
the
type
of
artificial
construction
which
takes
a
case
out
of
the
navigability
for
title
purposes
and
puts
it
under
the
commerce
clause
definition.
we're
not
required
to
dredge
the
channel,
do
a
lot
of
improvements,
there
is
just
simply
harbor
access.
the
master
found
that
there
are
very
few
natural
harbors
in
the
world
and
the
one
witness,
in
fact,
the
only
witness
who
was
an
expert
in
navigation
mr.
thomas
lundy
testified
that
he
was
familiar
with
many
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
other
parts
of
the
world
and
was
only
aware
of
one
natural
harbor.
mr.
lundy
was
associated
on
the
great
salt
lake
for
a
period
of
two
years,
where
he
was
involved
in
the
design,
construction
and
operation
of
a
fleet
of
39
boats
and
barges
that
were
used
to
place
a
causeway
fill
across
the
lake.
and
as
a
part
of
that
project,
it
was
necessary
to
construct
a
harbor
on
the
westside
of
the
promontory
mountains.
he
testified
that
rather
than
being
an
impediment,
that
the
lake
was
unusually
susceptible
in
this
regard
because
it
was
easy,
it
was
inexpensive
to
construct
the
harbor
because
of
the
clay
sediments
which
made
up
the
bed,
the
lack
of
bedrock
that
they
--
i
think
that
he
mentioned
that
the
harbor
was
400
by
1,500
feet.
he
further
testified
that
they
had
absolutely
no
maintenance
problems.
the
reason
for
this
he
said,
is
that
the
lake
has
no
currents,
so
you
don't
the
sediments
moving
back
in
like
you
do
on
most
river
systems
and
it
is
like
you
do
in
the
harbors
in
the
san
francisco
bay.
again
on
access,
the
special
master
found
that
a
number
of
piers
and
docking
facilities
existed
at
various
points
on
the
southern
shore
and
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
prior
to
statehood.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
now,
saltair
was
built
in
1893.
the
evidence
specifically
was
that
it
was
used
for
commercial
or
excursions,
pleasure
boats
but
commercial
excursions
and
that
at
times,
the
livestock
on
antelope
island
were
shipped
to
the
pier
at
saltair.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
saltair
is
the
old
pavilion
where
they
have
the
dance
hall
out
over
the
lake
and
where
the
lake
probably
got
primarily
known
for
its
ability
for
people
to
get
in
and
float
around.
i
think
it
came
from
--
its
fame
from
that
came
from
saltair
which
was
built
at
that
time.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
there
are
three
beaches
on
the
lake
now.
they
are
open.
they
operate
again
commercial
excursions
out
on
the
lake.
they
are
swimming
in
it.
the
state
park,
they're
building
a
state
park
on
antelope
island
on
the
north
tip
and
in
fact
is
constructing
a
200
boat
marina
there.
so,
brine
shrimp
industry,
though
not
to
compare
with
the
commerce
on
the
great
lakes,
it's
there,
the
livestock
industry
is
still
there.
scientific
investigation
is
going
on.
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
are
minerals
west
of
the
lake,
under
the
possibility
of
oil
and
gas
under
the
lake,
minerals
in
the
brines
and
solution,
the
waterfall
areas.
so
to
characterize
the
lake
as
a
desolate
forlorn
pond
of
water
just
simply
is
not
so.
we
believe
the
lake
does
have
a
great
future,
in
fact
that
it's
just
moving
into
that
phase.
we
think
the
pleasure
boating
and
the
access
that
will
be
needed
for
that
will
is
very
important.
the
government's
argument
that
the
lake
maybe
partially
navigable;
this
is
the
first
time
we've
heard
it.
it
was
not
advanced
below.
it's
not
part
of
the
master's
report.
it
was
never
presented
to
him
and
we
submit
the
lake
is
either
navigable
or
it
isn't
and
the
fact
that
has
some
shallow
areas
does
not
mean
that
you
carve
out
those
portions.
it
just
means
that
they
may
be
somewhat
of
an
impediment
but
they're
not
great
enough
to
destroy
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
it
would
seem
to
us
that
that
is
so
--
there
was
never
an
issue
on
this.
there
was
no
evidence
toward
it
to
a
partial
navigability
as
opposed
to
non
--
as
to
full
navigability
and
we,
of
course,
submit
that
it's
fully
navigable.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
i
would
think
so,
you'd
get
to
the
rocky
cliffs
and
so
forth.
that's
why
we
say
we
don't
believe
you
have
to
have
unlimited
access
to
a
body
of
water
to
make
it
navigable,
you
can
get
a
boat
in
at
every
spot.
it
simply
has
to
be
useful.
i
think
this
is
a
term
the
court
has
used
in
practical
and
that
we
think
that
lake
lends
itself
to
that.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
probably,
the
barges
which
were
used
to
place
the
causeway
fill
had
the
dimensions
of
250
feet
in
length,
50
feet
in
width,
had
a
carrying
capacity
equivalent
to
90
railroad
cars
and
drew
twelve-and-a-half
feet
of
water
on
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
of
course
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
right.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
the
master
said
they
extended
a
substantially
throughout
the
length
and
the
width
of
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes.
yes,
the
center
channel
is
very
wide;
many,
many
miles
wide.
it's
not
a
channel
like
a
river.
it's
much,
much
wider
than
that.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
you
bet.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
the
commerce
clause
definition
is
that,
if
it's
either
navigable
or
can
be
made
navigable
that
is
you
could
--
you
got
a
river
and
that
may
be
it's
got
a
lot
of
sand
bars
in
it
that
you
can
take
your
dredges
in
and
clean
them
out
well,
you
then
have
got
a
navigable
channel,
but
the
navigability
for
title
purposes
is
natural,
ordinary
conditions,
that
is
the
language
of
this
court.
and
we
don't
contend
for
the
more
generous
test
--
never
have
and
the
master
didn't
find,
finding
of
fact
31
says,
in
its
ordinary
condition
and
in
his
preface
to
the
findings,
he
said
it
must
be
navigable
in
its
natural
state
and
future
improvements
are
not
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
i
think
there
are
two
very
close,
the
mud
lake
case
or
the
holt
state
bank
case
is
a
lake
and
it
did
not
have
anywhere
near
the
size
of
the
great
salt
lake
and
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
in
the
former
utah
case,
u.s.
v.
utah
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
on
the
government's
interstate
argument,
we
believe
that
the
former
utah
case
is
conclusive
on
it.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
right,
the
--
it
was
undisputed
that
the
parts
of
the
colorado
and
the
green
rivers
which
were
found
to
be
navigable
were
navigable
only
intrastate,
only
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
utah,
but
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
many
impediments,
flooding
at
times
caused
problems.
there
was
debris,
ice
during
times
of
the
year
and
the
most
serious
impediment,
the
shifting
sand
bars
that
these
would
cause
the
water
to
spread
out,
loose
its
depths
and
in
that
case,
the
evidence
was
that
a
good
portion
of
the
year,
the
water
was
only
three
feet
deep,
much,
much
less
deep
than
the
waters
of
the
great
salt
lake
but
still
navigable.
and
that
again,
the
shifting
sand
bars
caused
the
channel
to
divide
and
shift
around.
but
nevertheless,
the
water
is
found
to
be
navigable.
in
fact
and
again
as
i
was
saying,
the
court
said
that
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
because
they
were
navigable,
in
fact,
they
were
utah's
property
and
it
was
clear
that
the
court
was
not
announcing
or
applying
a
new
concept
or
a
new
doctrine.
this
principle
was
already
well-established
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
utah
further
suggests
on
the
question
of
interstate
navigability,
the
argument
of
the
united
states
on
interstate
navigability
that
whatever
doubts
may
have
existed
before
they
were
removed
by
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
makes
it
very
clear,
that
congress
was
confirming
and
ratifying
title
in
the
states
to
inland
waters
which
were
intrastate
and
which
were
navigable
in
fact.
so
in
summary,
utah
would
submit
that
the
report,
the
findings
of
the
special
master
are
fully
supported
by
the
facts
of
the
case
that
he
did
apply
the
correct
rules
of
law,
correct
rationale
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
that
his
report
and
decree
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
that
utah
does
agree
that
the
issue
of
reliction
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time,
that
the
question
is
one
of
navigability.
utah
further
agrees
that
in
order
for
the
great
salt
lake
to
be
found
navigable
in
january
4,
1896,
it
must
have
been
navigable
in
its
natural
and
ordinary
condition.
we
submit
that
the
master
so
found.
we
disagree
with
the
united
states
in
the
interpretation
of
this
language
of
susceptibility.
we
believe
it
to
be
clear
on
the
court's
language
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank,
united
states
versus
utah,
that
actual
use
at
statehood
is
not
required.
it
is
a
capacity
for
use.
we
believe,
we
showed
a
great
deal
more
than
a
naked
physical
capacity,
but
we
believe
that
that
is
all
that
was
necessary.
that
is
does
the
body
of
water
have
sufficient
length,
width,
depth.
is
it
dependable?
is
it
there
year
in,
year
out?
all
seasons
of
the
year?
could
it
be
used
if
the
need
arises?
in
fact
in
the
holt
state
bank
case,
the
evidence
was
that
mud
lake
as
it
was
called,
only
enjoined
--
enjoyed
a
very
limited
historical
use
and
at
the
time
of
trial
was
drained
and
dry.
it
had
absolutely
no
future.
consequently,
any
discussion
as
to
what
the
future
may
hold
as
far
as
a
build
up
of
a
commerce
with
boats
going
everywhere
on
the
lake
at
various
points
is
simply
irrelevant.
title
either
vested
on
january
4,
1896
in
utah
or
it
didn't.
it
has
been
floating,
waiting
for
experience
to
show
what
the
traffic
will
be
on
the
lake.
this
is
why
the
court
has
used
and
correctly
so
the
very
definitive
test
of
susceptibility.
secondly,
we
believe
that
of
course,
the
actual
uses
demonstrate
a
susceptibility
very
well.
the
master
found
a
variety
of
uses.
he
found
the
great
many
different
kinds
of
boats
that
have
been
used
on
the
lake
both
before
and
after
statehood.
it's
true,
some
were
used
for
pleasure,
but
it's
also
true,
some
were
used
in
business.
and
again
in
united
states
versus
utah,
this
court
said
that
no
matter
what
they
use,
it
is
still
relevant
to
show
the
susceptibility.
the
united
states
in
the
earlier
case
made
the
very
argument,
it's
making
here
that
well
too
many
of
these
uses
are
private
in
nature
as
opposed
to
being
paid
for.
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
turning
to
the
argument
that
there
is
no
access
to
the
like,
that
it
is
too
difficult
to
get
to,
so
that
the
otherwise
usable
capacity
is
made
useless.
i
would
first
refer
to
the
map
which
counsel
has
submitted
to
the
court
and
point
out
that
the
special
master
found
that
antelope
island
had
been
continuously
inhabited
since
1848
and
the
witness
which
was
spoken
of
earlier,
zela
walker
manning
testified
that
she
was
born
on
that
island
in
the
early
1890's,
lived
there
and
that
her
testimony
was
that
boats
were
used
to
transport
livestock,
household
supplies,
grain,
farm
equipment.
this
is
across
the
very
area
which
the
united
states
says
its
too
shallow
to
navigate
and
that
you
can't
get
your
boat
to
the
shore
or
off
in
the
shore.
the
same
as
true
of
freemont
island.
it
has
sustained
a
viable
livestock
industry.
further
as
has
already
been
noted,
there
are
a
number
of
places
on
the
lake
where
the
bed
is
deep.
we
don't
deny
that
there
some
pretty
flat
shores
there
and
that
there
are
some
bogs,
but
again,
we
don't
believe
unlimited
capacity
is
a
requirement
that
you
have
to
be
able
to
get
in
at
every
spot.
again,
in
united
states
versus
utah,
this
court
observed
that
the
65
miles
of
the
colorado
river
which
it
found
to
be
navigable
flowed
through
rock
canyons
for
a
large
extent
that
had
walls
from
600
to
1,200
feet
in
height.
in
the
mud
lake
case,
the
court
concluded
that
that
lake
was
navigable
even
though
sand
bars
prevented
the
unrestricted
use
of
the
lake
and
here,
the
special
master
found
that
the
shallow
waters
which
are
around
the
shore
could
easily
be
avoided
by
keeping
into
the
navigable
channels
which
he
had
found
extended
substantially
throughout
the
length
and
width
of
the
lake.
the
point
is
that
if
someone
needs
to
build
a
pier
or
build
a
harbor,
there
are
some
good
spots
to
build
them.
this
is
not
the
type
of
artificial
construction
which
takes
a
case
out
of
the
navigability
for
title
purposes
and
puts
it
under
the
commerce
clause
definition.
we're
not
required
to
dredge
the
channel,
do
a
lot
of
improvements,
there
is
just
simply
harbor
access.
the
master
found
that
there
are
very
few
natural
harbors
in
the
world
and
the
one
witness,
in
fact,
the
only
witness
who
was
an
expert
in
navigation
mr.
thomas
lundy
testified
that
he
was
familiar
with
many
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
other
parts
of
the
world
and
was
only
aware
of
one
natural
harbor.
mr.
lundy
was
associated
on
the
great
salt
lake
for
a
period
of
two
years,
where
he
was
involved
in
the
design,
construction
and
operation
of
a
fleet
of
39
boats
and
barges
that
were
used
to
place
a
causeway
fill
across
the
lake.
and
as
a
part
of
that
project,
it
was
necessary
to
construct
a
harbor
on
the
westside
of
the
promontory
mountains.
he
testified
that
rather
than
being
an
impediment,
that
the
lake
was
unusually
susceptible
in
this
regard
because
it
was
easy,
it
was
inexpensive
to
construct
the
harbor
because
of
the
clay
sediments
which
made
up
the
bed,
the
lack
of
bedrock
that
they
--
i
think
that
he
mentioned
that
the
harbor
was
400
by
1,500
feet.
he
further
testified
that
they
had
absolutely
no
maintenance
problems.
the
reason
for
this
he
said,
is
that
the
lake
has
no
currents,
so
you
don't
the
sediments
moving
back
in
like
you
do
on
most
river
systems
and
it
is
like
you
do
in
the
harbors
in
the
san
francisco
bay.
again
on
access,
the
special
master
found
that
a
number
of
piers
and
docking
facilities
existed
at
various
points
on
the
southern
shore
and
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
prior
to
statehood.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
now,
saltair
was
built
in
1893.
the
evidence
specifically
was
that
it
was
used
for
commercial
or
excursions,
pleasure
boats
but
commercial
excursions
and
that
at
times,
the
livestock
on
antelope
island
were
shipped
to
the
pier
at
saltair.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
saltair
is
the
old
pavilion
where
they
have
the
dance
hall
out
over
the
lake
and
where
the
lake
probably
got
primarily
known
for
its
ability
for
people
to
get
in
and
float
around.
i
think
it
came
from
--
its
fame
from
that
came
from
saltair
which
was
built
at
that
time.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
there
are
three
beaches
on
the
lake
now.
they
are
open.
they
operate
again
commercial
excursions
out
on
the
lake.
they
are
swimming
in
it.
the
state
park,
they're
building
a
state
park
on
antelope
island
on
the
north
tip
and
in
fact
is
constructing
a
200
boat
marina
there.
so,
brine
shrimp
industry,
though
not
to
compare
with
the
commerce
on
the
great
lakes,
it's
there,
the
livestock
industry
is
still
there.
scientific
investigation
is
going
on.
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
are
minerals
west
of
the
lake,
under
the
possibility
of
oil
and
gas
under
the
lake,
minerals
in
the
brines
and
solution,
the
waterfall
areas.
so
to
characterize
the
lake
as
a
desolate
forlorn
pond
of
water
just
simply
is
not
so.
we
believe
the
lake
does
have
a
great
future,
in
fact
that
it's
just
moving
into
that
phase.
we
think
the
pleasure
boating
and
the
access
that
will
be
needed
for
that
will
is
very
important.
the
government's
argument
that
the
lake
maybe
partially
navigable;
this
is
the
first
time
we've
heard
it.
it
was
not
advanced
below.
it's
not
part
of
the
master's
report.
it
was
never
presented
to
him
and
we
submit
the
lake
is
either
navigable
or
it
isn't
and
the
fact
that
has
some
shallow
areas
does
not
mean
that
you
carve
out
those
portions.
it
just
means
that
they
may
be
somewhat
of
an
impediment
but
they're
not
great
enough
to
destroy
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
it
would
seem
to
us
that
that
is
so
--
there
was
never
an
issue
on
this.
there
was
no
evidence
toward
it
to
a
partial
navigability
as
opposed
to
non
--
as
to
full
navigability
and
we,
of
course,
submit
that
it's
fully
navigable.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
i
would
think
so,
you'd
get
to
the
rocky
cliffs
and
so
forth.
that's
why
we
say
we
don't
believe
you
have
to
have
unlimited
access
to
a
body
of
water
to
make
it
navigable,
you
can
get
a
boat
in
at
every
spot.
it
simply
has
to
be
useful.
i
think
this
is
a
term
the
court
has
used
in
practical
and
that
we
think
that
lake
lends
itself
to
that.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
probably,
the
barges
which
were
used
to
place
the
causeway
fill
had
the
dimensions
of
250
feet
in
length,
50
feet
in
width,
had
a
carrying
capacity
equivalent
to
90
railroad
cars
and
drew
twelve-and-a-half
feet
of
water
on
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
of
course
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
right.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
the
master
said
they
extended
a
substantially
throughout
the
length
and
the
width
of
the
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes.
yes,
the
center
channel
is
very
wide;
many,
many
miles
wide.
it's
not
a
channel
like
a
river.
it's
much,
much
wider
than
that.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
you
bet.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
the
commerce
clause
definition
is
that,
if
it's
either
navigable
or
can
be
made
navigable
that
is
you
could
--
you
got
a
river
and
that
may
be
it's
got
a
lot
of
sand
bars
in
it
that
you
can
take
your
dredges
in
and
clean
them
out
well,
you
then
have
got
a
navigable
channel,
but
the
navigability
for
title
purposes
is
natural,
ordinary
conditions,
that
is
the
language
of
this
court.
and
we
don't
contend
for
the
more
generous
test
--
never
have
and
the
master
didn't
find,
finding
of
fact
31
says,
in
its
ordinary
condition
and
in
his
preface
to
the
findings,
he
said
it
must
be
navigable
in
its
natural
state
and
future
improvements
are
not
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
i
think
there
are
two
very
close,
the
mud
lake
case
or
the
holt
state
bank
case
is
a
lake
and
it
did
not
have
anywhere
near
the
size
of
the
great
salt
lake
and
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
in
the
former
utah
case,
u.s.
v.
utah
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
on
the
government's
interstate
argument,
we
believe
that
the
former
utah
case
is
conclusive
on
it.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
right,
the
--
it
was
undisputed
that
the
parts
of
the
colorado
and
the
green
rivers
which
were
found
to
be
navigable
were
navigable
only
intrastate,
only
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
utah,
but
--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
many
impediments,
flooding
at
times
caused
problems.
there
was
debris,
ice
during
times
of
the
year
and
the
most
serious
impediment,
the
shifting
sand
bars
that
these
would
cause
the
water
to
spread
out,
loose
its
depths
and
in
that
case,
the
evidence
was
that
a
good
portion
of
the
year,
the
water
was
only
three
feet
deep,
much,
much
less
deep
than
the
waters
of
the
great
salt
lake
but
still
navigable.
and
that
again,
the
shifting
sand
bars
caused
the
channel
to
divide
and
shift
around.
but
nevertheless,
the
water
is
found
to
be
navigable.
in
fact
and
again
as
i
was
saying,
the
court
said
that
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
because
they
were
navigable,
in
fact,
they
were
utah's
property
and
it
was
clear
that
the
court
was
not
announcing
or
applying
a
new
concept
or
a
new
doctrine.
this
principle
was
already
well-established
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
utah
further
suggests
on
the
question
of
interstate
navigability,
the
argument
of
the
united
states
on
interstate
navigability
that
whatever
doubts
may
have
existed
before
they
were
removed
by
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
makes
it
very
clear,
that
congress
was
confirming
and
ratifying
title
in
the
states
to
inland
waters
which
were
intrastate
and
which
were
navigable
in
fact.
so
in
summary,
utah
would
submit
that
the
report,
the
findings
of
the
special
master
are
fully
supported
by
the
facts
of
the
case
that
he
did
apply
the
correct
rules
of
law,
correct
rationale
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
that
his
report
and
decree
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
