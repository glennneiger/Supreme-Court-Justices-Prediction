justice
potter
stewart
does
this
mean
mr.
strauss,
that
if
utah
should
prevail
here
that
the
proposed
decree
of
the
special
master
would
not
be
proper?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
here,
the
master
very
clearly
found
that
as
of
the
date
of
statehood
in
january
1896
the
lake
was
physically
capable
of
being
used
in
its
ordinary
condition
as
a
highway
for
floating
and
affording
passage
to
watercraft
in
the
manner
over
which
trade
and
travel
was
or
might
be
conducted
in
the
customary
modes
of
travel
on
water
at
that
time.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
went
on
to
say,
that
the
areas
of
the
lake
didn't
have
a
depths
sufficient
for
that
purpose,
was
--
were
not
narrow
or
short
channels
but
were
several
miles
wide
extending
substantially
through
the
length
and
width
of
the
lake
and
covered
an
area
of
more
than
a
thousand
square
miles.
justice
potter
stewart
that
a
vessel
could
travel
from
the
one
tip
of
the
lake
to
the
whole
length
of
it,
virtually
on
a
straight
line.
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
have
to
be
very
useful
in
commerce
in
order
to
be
navigable?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
little
different
from
being
very
useful
for
commerce,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
very
well,
very
well.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
strauss,
do
you
question
the
accuracy
of
the
master's
findings
48
and
49
on
pages
42
and
43
of
his
report.
justice
potter
stewart
showing
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
showing
more
than
a
dozen
or
so
modes
or
uses
of
water
transportation
on
the
lake?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
was
much
higher
than
it
is
now,
in
1896
when
it
became
a
state
and
that's
a
critical
time,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
significantly
higher
in
1896
than
it
is
now.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
a
testimony
of
that
woman,
zela
somebody,
who
was
born
before
the
statehood,
and
grew
up
on
antelope
island
until
she
was
12
years
old.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course,
i
suppose
people
couldn't
have
lived
and
worked
on
that
antelope
island
unless
the
lake
were
navigable,
could
they?
justice
potter
stewart
with
their
products.

with

they
use

in
the

justice
potter
stewart
is
anybody
--
can
anybody
swim
in
the
lake
anymore?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
draft
of
the
ship
like
the
queen
mary,
do
you
know,
30

stewart
twelve-and-a-half.
justice
potter
stewart
the
depth
at
the
time
of
the
statehood
it
was
30
feet,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
from
one
end
of
the
lake
to
the
other
of
great
width
of
channel
that
was
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
right.
what
i
mean
wide
channels
as
well?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
former
utah
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
was
the
river,
you
rather
like
the
law
expressed
in
that
case,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
well
as
the
question
of
navigability
in
fact
in
that
case
even
though
was
the
river
or
parts
of
the
rivers?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
there
were
many
impediments
to
that
case?
