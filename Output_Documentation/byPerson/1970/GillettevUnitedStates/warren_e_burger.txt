chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
325,
negre
against
larsen.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready
mr.
harrington.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
had
he
been
in
the
service
at
the
time
he
made
his
first
claim
?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
--
does
he
claim
that
this
belief
had
come
to
fruition
in
that
four
months
period
or
that
it
was
the
assignment
to
vietnam
that
merely
triggered
a
pre-existing
belief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
these
questions
were
preliminary
than
to
asking,
if
that's
the
case,
why
wouldn't
just
a
cancellation
of
his
assignment
to
vietnam
satisfy
his
objection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
his
position
was
taken
only
because
of
the
army
limitation
and
not
for
any
other
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
can
examine
or
review
whether
proper
standards
that
you
described
to
mr.
justice
white
have
been
applied.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
seem
to
finally
work
out
a
provision,
an
alternative,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
what
i
come
back
to,
the
army,
the
government
collectively
did
find
an
alternative
with
respect
to
this
man.
the
result
of
which
is
he
is
not
now
serving
in
any
active
capacity
but
you
say
he
maybe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
aren't
overpowering
him
today,
are
they,
to
keep
them
in
the
ready
reserve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
in
the
record
that
he
is
in
the
ready
reserve
now
as
distinguished
from
whether
he's
attending
or
not
attending
maybe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
why
his
posture
any
different
now
today
than
what
it
was
on
the
day
before
he
was
assigned
to
vietnam
and
had
then
served
acquiesced
to
serving
for
four
months
you
indicated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
doctrine
prohibit
him
or
would
does
it
affirmatively
permit
him
to
form
the
same
position
of
conscientious
that
you've
described
and
attributed
to
the
quaker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
of
his
individual
application
of
the
conscientious,
could
he
form
the
same
position,
total
pacifism,
that
of
the
quaker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
thank
you
harrington.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
i
take
it
mr.
solicitor
general
is
that
no
member
of
any
religious
group
on
that
ground
make
a
claim
of
selective
conscientious
objection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
correct
to
say,
that
another
way
to
put
your
positions
mr.
solicitor
general
is
that,
when
it's
a
selective
choice
subjective
on
the
basis
of
what
war,
then
the
reason
for
it
becomes
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
brief
i
have
is
not
read
that
way.
it
reads,
to
discriminate
between
just
wars
in
which
he
has
a
religious
duty
to
participate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
there
is
a
very
significant
distinction
beyond
the
use
of
that
term.
the
term,
may
and
must
is
very,
very
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
we
will
reach
that
now,
but
we
will
enlarge
your
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
we
will
allow
mr.
harrington,
although
he
is
out
of
time
to
have
two
minutes
to
respond
after
lunch,
but
in
the
meantime
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
you
would
arrange
to
say
what
version
you
wish
on
this
page
and
the
court
in
the
interim
will
arrange
to
have
at
least
nine
copies
made
so
that
we
will
know
precisely
what
position
we
would
act
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
haven't
reached
us
yet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
quite
late
to
have
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
we
will
see
it.
we'll
have
it
later.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
the
--
you
have
to
start
with
a
premise
that
it
is
discrimination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
go
from
that
premise,
you
don't
have
any
difficulty
with
the
conclusion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
to
prevent
presbyterian
or
methodist
or
baptist
or
anyone
else
from
applying
pope's
doctrine
or
the,
not
the
doctrine
but
the
historic
doctrine
of
the
church?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
case
depend
in
any
degree
on
how
many
of
them
there
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
98%
of
the
people
decided
to
do
that,
you
would
make
this
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
was
a
--
not
a
new
writ
since
he
went
into
reserve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
harrington.

mr.

ask
you
this.
what
significance
do
you
suppose
a
reader
should
attach
to
his
statement
in
the

paragraph
that
he
might
very
well,
he
very
well
might
fight
