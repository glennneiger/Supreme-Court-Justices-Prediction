mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
my
name
is
conrad
lynn.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
and
my
co-counsel
here
are
leon
friedman
and
mr.
marvin
karpatkin
of
new
york
city.
this
appeal
has
been
brought
to
some
extent
as
a
selective
conscientious
objector
claim.
i
feel
that
in
fairness
to
the
petitioner
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
exactly
what
this
young
man
has
become
and
was
at
the
time
that
he
faced
his
draft
board
on
the
examination
for
the
qualifications
for
conscientious
objector.
this
young
man
had
graduated
from
high
school
and
went
to
texas
to
become
a
cowboy
right
after
his
graduation.
and
after
returning
from
texas,
he
attended
a
school,
the
neighborhood
playhouse
school
in
new
york
city
for
two
years
and
he
was
granted
a
deferment,
2s
deferment
as
as
student
for
those
two
years.
thereafter,
he
was
classified
1a.
in
the
spring
of
1967,
he
felt
called
upon
to
write
his
draft
board
and
when
he
was
classified
in
the
early
spring
in
march
1964,
in
his
classification
questionnaire,
he
had
not
made
any
claim
for
being
a
conscientious
objector.
but
by
april
1967,
this
was,
of
course,
after
the
heating
up
of
the
war
in
vietnam,
he
wrote
his
draft
board
and
i
think
i
ought
to
read
the
letter
he
wrote
to
his
draft
board,
part
of
it
at
least.
"i
am
requesting
the
classification
of
conscientious
objector
on
the
basis
of
the
following
reasons,
one
--"
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
this
is
on
page

of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
say
that.
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
"i
am
requesting
the
classification
of
conscientious
objector
on
the
basis
of
the
following
reasons.
one,
i
believe
that
the
united
states
government
is
using
all
the
brutal
instruments
of
modern
war
against
a
poor
peasant
population,
which
simply
claims
the
right
to
have
a
government
of
its
own
free
choice.
two,
i
object
to
any
assignment
in
the
united
states
armed
forces
while
this
unnecessary
and
unjust
war
is
being
waged
on
the
grounds
of
religious
belief,
specifically
humanism.
this
essentially
means
respect
and
love
for
man,
faith
in
his
inherent
goodness
and
perfectibility
and
confidence
in
his
capability
to
improve
some
of
the
pains
of
the
human
condition."
thereafter,
he
was
sent
the
form
150
and
he
filled
it
out
and
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
whether
he
was
religious,
he
wrote
in
his
form,
"religion
to
me
means
a
devotion
of
man
to
the
highest
ideal
that
he
can
conceive
and
a
respect
for
the
dignity
and
voice
of
every
human
being
and
a
capacity
to
enter
into
decent
and
just
and
loving
relations
with
other
human
beings,
is
not
depended
upon
being
a
member
of
a
specific
religious
sect
or
organization."
now,
as
i
understand
from
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
there
is
no
issue
being
made
as
to
whether
this
young
man
is
religious
under
the
seeger
and
the
welsh
cases.
i
think
that
is
not
in
dispute.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
and
the
question
of
sincerity,
if
it
please,
was
not
disputed.
it
was
the
judge
wyatt
(ph)
who
was
a
trial
judge
in
the
seventh
district
court
in
new
york,
he
set
aside
from
the
question
of
sincerity.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
also
did
not
question
the
sincerity.
there
was
no
specific
statement
from
either
court,
we
believe
this
young
man,
to
be
sincere;
it
was
simply
not
an
issue
in
the
mind
of
the
court,
as
it
did
not
seem
to
be
an
issue
in
the
minds
of
the
draft
board,
because
the
draft
board
simply
said
that
this
registrant
seems
to
derive
his
objection
to
the
war,
mainly
from
the
vietnam
war.
i'd
like
to
read
what
the
draft
board
said
and
that
is
on
page
11,
page
11
of
the
appendix,
the
joint
appendix
here,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
"registrant
stated,
his
conscious
won't
let
him
fight
in
vietnam,"
this
is
the
summary
of
the
draft
board
after
the
hearing.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
page
11,
page
11
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
last
paragraph.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
oh!
is
it
also
on
page
7
of
brief?
i
didn't
remember.
oh
yes,
of
course.
"registrant
stated
his
conscious
would
not
let
him
fight
in
vietnam.
registrant
also
stated,
he
could
not
honestly
say,
he
would
not
defend
his
country
if
it
were
attacked.
he
very
well
might
fight
with
respect
to
the
country
being
attacked.
his
main
source
of
information
which
brought
about
these
beliefs
was
from
the
news
media
in
respect
to
publications
on
the
war.
registrant
is
a
post
military
service
in
the
case
of
the
vietnam
war.
registrant
formed
his
beliefs
in
this
past
two
years
or
so
and
is
more
or
less
a
result
of
the
vietnam
war."
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that
means
that
he
does
not
want
to
foreclose
a
future
contingency.
i
think
it
was
an
attempt
to
be
as
honest
as
possible.
i
recall
very
well,
your
honor,
when
we
used
to
be
addressed
by
norman
thomas,
a
socialist
candidate
for
president,
who
was
an
absolute
pacifist
during
the
wars
and
he
was
against
all
wars
as
he
made
very
plain
and
he
was
very
active
in
the
movement
against
all
wars.
but
when
the
second
world
war
came
and
we
were
attacked
at
pearl
harbor
then
norman
thomas
gave
what
he
called
constructive
support
to
the
war.
in
other
words,
although,
--
i
believe
and
i
don't
think
anyone
ever
questioned
his
sincerity
between
the
two
world
wars
that
he
was
absolutely
opposed
to
all
war.
he
was
absolute
pacifist
and
even
when
he
was
questioned
on
the
advent
of
hitler
to
power,
he
said
that
he
felt
that
he
should
be
resisted
with
passive
resistance.
but
nevertheless,
when
the
united
states
of
america
was
attacked
at
pearl
harbor,
there
was
something
else
in
him.
he
was
an
american
citizen
and
he
said
then,
i
will
have
to
change
my
mind
and
he
gave
constructive
support
to
the
war.
he
was
honest
each
time
but
there
were
different
occasions
which
greatly
moved
him.
so
this
young
man
just
as
the
young
man
in
the
sisson
case
as
judge
wyzanski
pointed
out,
he
was
being
honest
as
he
could
be
at
this
time
when
he
is
being
questioned.
he
is
sure
of
what
he
is
saying
and
what
he
believes
at
this
point
and
therefore,
he
said,
i
might
defend
the
country
if
it
were
attacked
because
he
could
not
be
satan
of
of
what
happened
to
him
in
that
contingency
and
i
submit
that,
that
does
not
derogate
from
the
sincerity
of
his
conviction,
of
being
opposed
to
the
war.
now,
i
say
further
that
when
he
was
questioned
as
comes
out
in
the
further
questioning
that
he
would
defend
his
family
or
defend
himself
from
attacking,
he
would
defend
it
by
every
means
necessary,
defend
from
attack.
these
are
exceptions
that
have
been
recognized
because
it
is
true
that
absolute
pacifist
does
not
resisted
all,
an
absolute
pacifist
does
not
resisted
all.
contrary
to
the
statement
on
page
16
of
the
government's
answering
brief
which
says
that
the
congress
has
recognized
conscientious
objection
as
a
basis
for
exemption,
at
the
top
of
the
page
16,
for
military
service
has
--
it
extend
as
a
privilege
to
persons
other
than
those
who
are
total
pacifist.
pardon
me,
i
need
to
go
back
on
page
15
at
the
end.
"never
in
all
the
years
in
which
congress
has
recognized
conscientious
objection
as
a
basis
for
exemption
from
military
service,
has
it
extended
the
privilege
to
persons
other
than
those
who
were
total
pacifists,
that
is
opposed
to
all
forms
of
war.
now
that
is
not
altogether
accurate,
of
course,
because
that
exception
of
the
proviso
that
i
would
defend
myself,
i
would
defend
my
friends,
i
would
defend
those
close
to
me
has
not
been
considered
to
prevent
a
person
from
being
considered
a
conscientious
objector.
and
of
course,
as
the
court
is
well
aware
in
the
whole
line
of
cases,
involving
jehovah's
witnesses
culminating
in
the
sicurella
case,
this
exception
on
the
part
of
jehovah's
witnesses
who
have
written
tracks,
they
published
a
track
in
1951
in
their
publication
"watch
god,"
i
think
--
watchtower.
they
published
an
article
saying
why
we
are
not
pacifists
and
the
court
in
sicurella
handled
that
by
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
jehovah's
witnesses
were
not
really
concerned
with
the
war,
when
they
said,
we
are
ready
for
war
that
is
god
ordained,
that
our
jehovah
says
that
we
should
participate
in.
we
are
ready
for
that
war,
when
they
said
that,
they
don't
mean
a
real
war
on
it.
however,
they
were
other
authorities,
baington
(ph)
for
example,
who
said
that
the
jehovah's
witnesses
might
very
well
have
considered
that
the
first
world
war
was
a
one
where
the
anti-christ
was
involved,
the
german
kaiser
and
therefore,
they
might
very
well.
i
don't
personally
know
what
the
position
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
was
in
the
first
world
war,
but
it
isn't
as
if
the
jehovah's
witnesses
would
not
fight
in
any
war.
if
they
felt
that
a
war
were
a
god
ordained,
a
war
right
on
as
many
as
all
of
the
justices
know,
many
of
the
most
bitter
wars
have
been
religious
wars,
so
that
when
you
exempt
people
who
are
in
favor
of
a
war
that
so
conforms
with
their
religion,
then
you
are
making
a
very
major
exemption.
and
so
therefore,
we
have
here
the
germ
of
the
approach
to
save
the
statute
because
as
i
see
it,
the
court
has
the
choice
in
this
argument
of
saving
the
statute
by
interpreting
it
as
it
was
interpreted
for
one
way
in
the
tass
(ph)
case
where
the
court,
a
court
of
appeals,
the
eight
circuit
felt
that
when
the
statute
said,
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
it
was
--
in
any
form,
it
was
talking
about
a
modification
of
participation
in
any
form
or
participation,
that
was
perhaps
a
semantic
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem.
but
they
did
have
this
question,
this
logical
question
that
there
are
exceptions
to
a
person
not
being
willing
to
engage
in
violent
conduct
and
yet
he
is
qualified
as
a
conscientious
objector.
the
court
has
had
this
problem,
of
course,
before
with
this
same
statute.
the
law
does
read
very
clearly
that
a
person,
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
qualifies
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
originally
the
statute
said
also
that
the
touchstone
was
whether
the
person
believe
in
a
supreme
being.
now,
of
course,
in
the
seeger
case,
the
court
interpreted
that
statute
in
accordance,
i
submit,
with
the
contemporary
understanding
of
religion
in
large
sections
of
the
population.
we
know
many
sincere
and
religiously
motivated
persons,
no
longer
believe
in
the
anthropomorphic
god
and
yet
they
are
stirred
by
the
religious
impulses.
and
therefore,
in
seeger,
this
court
recognized
that
and
then
in
the
welsh
case,
which
was
even
further
ahead
and
the
welsh
case
went
so
far
to
say
and
that
this
germane
here
that
even
if
a
person,
as
a
part
of
his
moral
stats,
had
taken
into
account
political
problems
as
welsh
had
very
much
so
and
economic
problems
and
the
social
destiny
of
the
country,
even
though
this
was
apart,
and
the
statute
said
that
merely
philosophical,
social,
political
beliefs
cannot
be
a
part
of
this
religious
feeling.
nevertheless,
the
court
pointed
out
and
i
think
very
logically
and
in
accordance
with
reality
that
very
often
the
political
and
economic
and
social
feelings
of
a
person
contributes
to
his
total
moral
position,
that
core
of
conscious
which
is
supreme
for
the
individual.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
what's
that?
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
no,
that
is
not.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
your
recollection
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
that
one
judge
was
speaking
for
four
and
then
the
judge
harlan
had
a
separate
opinion,
however,
it
was
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
the
court
opinion
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
no
and
what
your
honor
is
saying
really
is
that
they
were
only
four
judges
who
can
be
said
to
have
joined,
to
have
the
opinion
that
was
expressed
in
the
opinion
written
by
justice
black.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that's
true.
now,
of
course,
when
judge
harlan
wrote
his
concurring
opinion,
he
pointed
out
that
as
in
the
seeger,
the
court
was
concerning
an
exercise
of
saving
the
statute
and
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes,
he
did
because
he
said
that
was
it
really
--
as
i
understand
what
mr.
justice
harlan
was
saying,
was
that
the
court
really
is
in
a
sense
repealing
the
statute,
that's
how
i
understood
it
and
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
saved.
now,
i
feel
that
this
is
the
way
it
has
been
saved
whether
that
was
a
majority
opinion
or
not.
at
this
time,
the
law
stands
because
there
were
four
judges
concurring
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred
in
the
judgment
so
that
welsh
was
vindicated
in
the
judgment
even
though
as
mr.
justice
stewart
says
there
was
no
majority
expression
of
a
joint
position
in
that
case.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
right.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that's
what
i
understand.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that's
the
issue
and
your
honor,
if
the
court
feels
that
the
statute
could
not
bear
an
interpretation
that
this
major
emphasis,
as
i
see
mr.
gillette's
position,
the
war
triggered
his
thinking
about
in
1964
when
he
registered
he
said
nothing.
that
was
in
the
very
beginning
of
1964.
it
was
before
the
war
had
actually
heated
up
after
the
gulf
of
tonkin
resolution.
now
he
developed
his
position,
he
has
watched
the
war
as
he
said.
i
mean,
this
had
an
effect
on
his
thinking,
and
he
became
convinced
as
a
result
of
what
he
was
witnessing
as
he
said,
as
the
board
said,
he
had
watched
it
on
the
news
media,
on
tv,
and
over
the
radio,
he
have
read
the
newspapers,
this
had
a
profound
effect
on
him.
he
didn't
claim
that
he
had
read
all
the
philosophers'
life
as
sisson.
sisson
made,
he
had
gotten
his
masters
in
philosophy,
and
no
doubt,
he
had
a
more
systematic
background.
but
this
young
man
became
convinced
as
he
lived
through
the
events
very
curiously
everyday.
and
that's
how
he
formed
his
conviction,
and
as
he
said,
as
he
testified,
before
the
draft
board
when
he
was
questioned,
he
had
gotten
through
the
vietnam
war,
a
feeling
against
war.
now
that
is
a
position,
i
think,
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of.
now
it
maybe
that
on
ballots
the
draft
board's
finding
should
be
accepted.
now
if
it
is
accepted,
then
and
if
the
statute
cannot
bear
the
interpretation
that
a
person
religiously
motivated
in
the
sense
of
the
seeger
case,
can
be
a
conscientious
objector
if
the
main
thrust
of
his
feeling
is
against
the
war
in
which
he
is
faced
with.
as
he
said,
i
am
against
the
war,
because
this
is
the
war
that
i
am
faced
with.
if
it
cannot
be
of
that
interpretation,
then,
of
course,
i
don't
see
how
the
statute
can
stand
under
the
first
amendment
because
there
is
no
question,
but
that
they
have
this
position,
this
particular
religious
view
that
he
has
is
sincerely
held,
and
to
deny
him
the
right
to
be
a
conscientious
objector
when
others
are
granted
it
who
have
a
more
general
position.
although
in
my
opinion,
a
person
who
is
so
careful
as
he
was
to
make
claim
that
he
didn't
foreclose
the
possibility,
that
he
might
defend
his
country,
if
it
were
actually
attacked,
i
would
say
that
this
is
profound
and
is
a
position
of
that
meriting
as
great
due
respect
as
any
possible
position.
now
in
the
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
what
i
would
--
i
would
say
about
one
quarter
whole
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes,
it
does,
because
as
he
made
it
plain
to
the
draft
board
and,
as
we
quote
in
this,
he
said,
"i
would
not
take
part
in
the
war
effort."
that
means
in
other
words,
if
he
weren't
in
the
continent
of
the
united
states,
he
would
be
taking
the
place
of
a
man
who
would
be
serving.
and
what
his
thrust
was
as
you
may
notice
by
all
his
statements,
and
the
statements
of
the
the
draft
board
itself,
his
criticism
is
not
of
any
danger
to
himself.
his
criticism
and
his
feeling,
his
moral
revulsion
is
directed
towards
what
is
happening
to
the
people
over
there.
at
no
time
did
the
draft
board
say,
and
in
no
time
did
he
express
any
feeling
about
his
own
safety
that
he
doesn't
want
to
participate.
he
was
opposed
to
taking
part
in
the
war
effort
as
a
whole
because
that's
really
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
of
course
not,
but
because
this
war
has
affected
his
belief
to
such
a
degree
that
he
cannot
take
any
part
whatsoever
in
its
support.
therefore
he
could
not
conscientiously
say
even
over
here
because
he
would
be
replacing
a
man
who
might
very
well
participate
in
that
portion
of
it,
which
greatly
revokes
his
feelings
and
i
think
that
this
is
not
only,
he
has
this
right
not
just
because
of
statute.
i
think
he
has
this
right
under
the
first
amendment
because
where
you
have
conceded
that
this
is
a
religiously
motivated
impulse.
then
you
recognize
the
supremacy
of
conscience
and
the
one
parallel
case
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge,
chief
justice
charles
evans
hughes
in
us
against
macintosh,
speaking
for
himself
and
stone
and
holmes
and
brandeis,
and
that
position
i
think
was
later
adopted
by
judge
douglas
in
writing
the
majority
opinion
in
girouard,
and
where
this
person
had
said
that
he
could
not
take
an
oath
to
participate
in
all
wars
that
his
conscience
would
have
to
determine
whether
he
could
take,
and
of
course,
he
was
denied
the
right
to
become
a
citizen.
but
in
the
girouard
case,
of
course
the
court
held
that
the
domain
of
conscience
is
supreme
reading.
a
brief
from
the
opinion
in
the
--
reading
briefly
from
the
opinion
which
was
adopted
in
girouard
case,
reading
from
the
judge
hughes
opinion.
"undoubtedly
in
the
forum
of
conscience,
duty
to
a
moral
power
higher
than
the
state
has
always
been
maintained."
so
i
think
that
the
unites
states
constitution
recognizes
in
the
first
amendment,
this
right
of
conscience
and
as
was
said
by
stone
in
his
great
essay
which
was
quoted
in
the
seeger
case.
a
state
should,
a
state
that
we
can
support,
should
recognize
this
supremacy
of
the
conscience.
all
of
our
history,
he
says,
which
is
quoted
in
seeger
at
page
170.
"all
our
history
gives
confirmation
to
the
view
that
liberty
of
conscience
has
a
moral
and
social
value
which
makes
it
worthy
of
preservation
at
the
hands
of
the
state.
so
deep
in
its
significance
and
vital,
indeed,
is
it
to
the
integrity
of
man's
moral
and
spiritual
nature
that
nothing
short
of
the
self-preservation
of
the
state
should
warrant
its
violation.
and
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
the
state
which
preserves
its
life
by
a
settled
policy
of
violation
of
the
conscience
of
the
individual
will
not
in
fact
ultimately
lose
it
by
the
process."
i
think
this
is
the
core
of
the
position
of
this
petition.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
i
just
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
draft
board
in
this
case
was
--
disqualified
him
because
he
said,
mr.
gillette,
that
it
was
the
vietnam
war,
that
forced
him
to
have
was
the
motivating
force
from
having
a
conscientious
objector
position.
to
conclude
from
that,
that
it
was
only
this
war
he
is
objected
to,
i
think
is
an
extension
of
what
was
really
said
and
it
was
a
conclusion
on
the
part
of
a
draft
board
which
i
think
was
unjustified.
and
secondly,
i
might
point
out
that
in
seeger
and
not
weaving
of
welsh
altogether
but
in
seeger,
it
was
acknowledged
that
political
considerations
might
very
well
form
a
part
of
the
base
of
conscience.
how
can
one
in
our
time
and
especially
young
man,
was
so
must
think
deeply
about
these
problems
completely
put
aside
any
political
consideration
in
coming
to
a
moral
stage
in
their
conscience.
and
i
think
it
would
be
--
it's
artificial
to
say
that
there
must
be
no
political
consideration
at
all
before
a
conscientious
objection
is
recognized.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
my
name
is
conrad
lynn.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
and
my
co-counsel
here
are
leon
friedman
and
mr.
marvin
karpatkin
of
new
york
city.
this
appeal
has
been
brought
to
some
extent
as
a
selective
conscientious
objector
claim.
i
feel
that
in
fairness
to
the
petitioner
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
exactly
what
this
young
man
has
become
and
was
at
the
time
that
he
faced
his
draft
board
on
the
examination
for
the
qualifications
for
conscientious
objector.
this
young
man
had
graduated
from
high
school
and
went
to
texas
to
become
a
cowboy
right
after
his
graduation.
and
after
returning
from
texas,
he
attended
a
school,
the
neighborhood
playhouse
school
in
new
york
city
for
two
years
and
he
was
granted
a
deferment,
2s
deferment
as
as
student
for
those
two
years.
thereafter,
he
was
classified
1a.
in
the
spring
of
1967,
he
felt
called
upon
to
write
his
draft
board
and
when
he
was
classified
in
the
early
spring
in
march
1964,
in
his
classification
questionnaire,
he
had
not
made
any
claim
for
being
a
conscientious
objector.
but
by
april
1967,
this
was,
of
course,
after
the
heating
up
of
the
war
in
vietnam,
he
wrote
his
draft
board
and
i
think
i
ought
to
read
the
letter
he
wrote
to
his
draft
board,
part
of
it
at
least.
"i
am
requesting
the
classification
of
conscientious
objector
on
the
basis
of
the
following
reasons,
one
--"
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
this
is
on
page
3
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
say
that.
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
"i
am
requesting
the
classification
of
conscientious
objector
on
the
basis
of
the
following
reasons.
one,
i
believe
that
the
united
states
government
is
using
all
the
brutal
instruments
of
modern
war
against
a
poor
peasant
population,
which
simply
claims
the
right
to
have
a
government
of
its
own
free
choice.
two,
i
object
to
any
assignment
in
the
united
states
armed
forces
while
this
unnecessary
and
unjust
war
is
being
waged
on
the
grounds
of
religious
belief,
specifically
humanism.
this
essentially
means
respect
and
love
for
man,
faith
in
his
inherent
goodness
and
perfectibility
and
confidence
in
his
capability
to
improve
some
of
the
pains
of
the
human
condition."
thereafter,
he
was
sent
the
form
150
and
he
filled
it
out
and
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
whether
he
was
religious,
he
wrote
in
his
form,
"religion
to
me
means
a
devotion
of
man
to
the
highest
ideal
that
he
can
conceive
and
a
respect
for
the
dignity
and
voice
of
every
human
being
and
a
capacity
to
enter
into
decent
and
just
and
loving
relations
with
other
human
beings,
is
not
depended
upon
being
a
member
of
a
specific
religious
sect
or
organization."
now,
as
i
understand
from
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
there
is
no
issue
being
made
as
to
whether
this
young
man
is
religious
under
the
seeger
and
the
welsh
cases.
i
think
that
is
not
in
dispute.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
and
the
question
of
sincerity,
if
it
please,
was
not
disputed.
it
was
the
judge
wyatt
(ph)
who
was
a
trial
judge
in
the
seventh
district
court
in
new
york,
he
set
aside
from
the
question
of
sincerity.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
also
did
not
question
the
sincerity.
there
was
no
specific
statement
from
either
court,
we
believe
this
young
man,
to
be
sincere;
it
was
simply
not
an
issue
in
the
mind
of
the
court,
as
it
did
not
seem
to
be
an
issue
in
the
minds
of
the
draft
board,
because
the
draft
board
simply
said
that
this
registrant
seems
to
derive
his
objection
to
the
war,
mainly
from
the
vietnam
war.
i'd
like
to
read
what
the
draft
board
said
and
that
is
on
page
11,
page
11
of
the
appendix,
the
joint
appendix
here,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
"registrant
stated,
his
conscious
won't
let
him
fight
in
vietnam,"
this
is
the
summary
of
the
draft
board
after
the
hearing.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
page
11,
page
11
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
last
paragraph.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
oh!
is
it
also
on
page
7
of
brief?
i
didn't
remember.
oh
yes,
of
course.
"registrant
stated
his
conscious
would
not
let
him
fight
in
vietnam.
registrant
also
stated,
he
could
not
honestly
say,
he
would
not
defend
his
country
if
it
were
attacked.
he
very
well
might
fight
with
respect
to
the
country
being
attacked.
his
main
source
of
information
which
brought
about
these
beliefs
was
from
the
news
media
in
respect
to
publications
on
the
war.
registrant
is
a
post
military
service
in
the
case
of
the
vietnam
war.
registrant
formed
his
beliefs
in
this
past
two
years
or
so
and
is
more
or
less
a
result
of
the
vietnam
war."
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that
means
that
he
does
not
want
to
foreclose
a
future
contingency.
i
think
it
was
an
attempt
to
be
as
honest
as
possible.
i
recall
very
well,
your
honor,
when
we
used
to
be
addressed
by
norman
thomas,
a
socialist
candidate
for
president,
who
was
an
absolute
pacifist
during
the
wars
and
he
was
against
all
wars
as
he
made
very
plain
and
he
was
very
active
in
the
movement
against
all
wars.
but
when
the
second
world
war
came
and
we
were
attacked
at
pearl
harbor
then
norman
thomas
gave
what
he
called
constructive
support
to
the
war.
in
other
words,
although,
--
i
believe
and
i
don't
think
anyone
ever
questioned
his
sincerity
between
the
two
world
wars
that
he
was
absolutely
opposed
to
all
war.
he
was
absolute
pacifist
and
even
when
he
was
questioned
on
the
advent
of
hitler
to
power,
he
said
that
he
felt
that
he
should
be
resisted
with
passive
resistance.
but
nevertheless,
when
the
united
states
of
america
was
attacked
at
pearl
harbor,
there
was
something
else
in
him.
he
was
an
american
citizen
and
he
said
then,
i
will
have
to
change
my
mind
and
he
gave
constructive
support
to
the
war.
he
was
honest
each
time
but
there
were
different
occasions
which
greatly
moved
him.
so
this
young
man
just
as
the
young
man
in
the
sisson
case
as
judge
wyzanski
pointed
out,
he
was
being
honest
as
he
could
be
at
this
time
when
he
is
being
questioned.
he
is
sure
of
what
he
is
saying
and
what
he
believes
at
this
point
and
therefore,
he
said,
i
might
defend
the
country
if
it
were
attacked
because
he
could
not
be
satan
of
of
what
happened
to
him
in
that
contingency
and
i
submit
that,
that
does
not
derogate
from
the
sincerity
of
his
conviction,
of
being
opposed
to
the
war.
now,
i
say
further
that
when
he
was
questioned
as
comes
out
in
the
further
questioning
that
he
would
defend
his
family
or
defend
himself
from
attacking,
he
would
defend
it
by
every
means
necessary,
defend
from
attack.
these
are
exceptions
that
have
been
recognized
because
it
is
true
that
absolute
pacifist
does
not
resisted
all,
an
absolute
pacifist
does
not
resisted
all.
contrary
to
the
statement
on
page
16
of
the
government's
answering
brief
which
says
that
the
congress
has
recognized
conscientious
objection
as
a
basis
for
exemption,
at
the
top
of
the
page
16,
for
military
service
has
--
it
extend
as
a
privilege
to
persons
other
than
those
who
are
total
pacifist.
pardon
me,
i
need
to
go
back
on
page
15
at
the
end.
"never
in
all
the
years
in
which
congress
has
recognized
conscientious
objection
as
a
basis
for
exemption
from
military
service,
has
it
extended
the
privilege
to
persons
other
than
those
who
were
total
pacifists,
that
is
opposed
to
all
forms
of
war.
now
that
is
not
altogether
accurate,
of
course,
because
that
exception
of
the
proviso
that
i
would
defend
myself,
i
would
defend
my
friends,
i
would
defend
those
close
to
me
has
not
been
considered
to
prevent
a
person
from
being
considered
a
conscientious
objector.
and
of
course,
as
the
court
is
well
aware
in
the
whole
line
of
cases,
involving
jehovah's
witnesses
culminating
in
the
sicurella
case,
this
exception
on
the
part
of
jehovah's
witnesses
who
have
written
tracks,
they
published
a
track
in
1951
in
their
publication
"watch
god,"
i
think
--
watchtower.
they
published
an
article
saying
why
we
are
not
pacifists
and
the
court
in
sicurella
handled
that
by
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
jehovah's
witnesses
were
not
really
concerned
with
the
war,
when
they
said,
we
are
ready
for
war
that
is
god
ordained,
that
our
jehovah
says
that
we
should
participate
in.
we
are
ready
for
that
war,
when
they
said
that,
they
don't
mean
a
real
war
on
it.
however,
they
were
other
authorities,
baington
(ph)
for
example,
who
said
that
the
jehovah's
witnesses
might
very
well
have
considered
that
the
first
world
war
was
a
one
where
the
anti-christ
was
involved,
the
german
kaiser
and
therefore,
they
might
very
well.
i
don't
personally
know
what
the
position
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
was
in
the
first
world
war,
but
it
isn't
as
if
the
jehovah's
witnesses
would
not
fight
in
any
war.
if
they
felt
that
a
war
were
a
god
ordained,
a
war
right
on
as
many
as
all
of
the
justices
know,
many
of
the
most
bitter
wars
have
been
religious
wars,
so
that
when
you
exempt
people
who
are
in
favor
of
a
war
that
so
conforms
with
their
religion,
then
you
are
making
a
very
major
exemption.
and
so
therefore,
we
have
here
the
germ
of
the
approach
to
save
the
statute
because
as
i
see
it,
the
court
has
the
choice
in
this
argument
of
saving
the
statute
by
interpreting
it
as
it
was
interpreted
for
one
way
in
the
tass
(ph)
case
where
the
court,
a
court
of
appeals,
the
eight
circuit
felt
that
when
the
statute
said,
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
it
was
--
in
any
form,
it
was
talking
about
a
modification
of
participation
in
any
form
or
participation,
that
was
perhaps
a
semantic
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem.
but
they
did
have
this
question,
this
logical
question
that
there
are
exceptions
to
a
person
not
being
willing
to
engage
in
violent
conduct
and
yet
he
is
qualified
as
a
conscientious
objector.
the
court
has
had
this
problem,
of
course,
before
with
this
same
statute.
the
law
does
read
very
clearly
that
a
person,
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief
qualifies
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
originally
the
statute
said
also
that
the
touchstone
was
whether
the
person
believe
in
a
supreme
being.
now,
of
course,
in
the
seeger
case,
the
court
interpreted
that
statute
in
accordance,
i
submit,
with
the
contemporary
understanding
of
religion
in
large
sections
of
the
population.
we
know
many
sincere
and
religiously
motivated
persons,
no
longer
believe
in
the
anthropomorphic
god
and
yet
they
are
stirred
by
the
religious
impulses.
and
therefore,
in
seeger,
this
court
recognized
that
and
then
in
the
welsh
case,
which
was
even
further
ahead
and
the
welsh
case
went
so
far
to
say
and
that
this
germane
here
that
even
if
a
person,
as
a
part
of
his
moral
stats,
had
taken
into
account
political
problems
as
welsh
had
very
much
so
and
economic
problems
and
the
social
destiny
of
the
country,
even
though
this
was
apart,
and
the
statute
said
that
merely
philosophical,
social,
political
beliefs
cannot
be
a
part
of
this
religious
feeling.
nevertheless,
the
court
pointed
out
and
i
think
very
logically
and
in
accordance
with
reality
that
very
often
the
political
and
economic
and
social
feelings
of
a
person
contributes
to
his
total
moral
position,
that
core
of
conscious
which
is
supreme
for
the
individual.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
what's
that?
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
no,
that
is
not.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
your
recollection
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
that
one
judge
was
speaking
for
four
and
then
the
judge
harlan
had
a
separate
opinion,
however,
it
was
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
the
court
opinion
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
no
and
what
your
honor
is
saying
really
is
that
they
were
only
four
judges
who
can
be
said
to
have
joined,
to
have
the
opinion
that
was
expressed
in
the
opinion
written
by
justice
black.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that's
true.
now,
of
course,
when
judge
harlan
wrote
his
concurring
opinion,
he
pointed
out
that
as
in
the
seeger,
the
court
was
concerning
an
exercise
of
saving
the
statute
and
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes,
he
did
because
he
said
that
was
it
really
--
as
i
understand
what
mr.
justice
harlan
was
saying,
was
that
the
court
really
is
in
a
sense
repealing
the
statute,
that's
how
i
understood
it
and
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
saved.
now,
i
feel
that
this
is
the
way
it
has
been
saved
whether
that
was
a
majority
opinion
or
not.
at
this
time,
the
law
stands
because
there
were
four
judges
concurring
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred
in
the
judgment
so
that
welsh
was
vindicated
in
the
judgment
even
though
as
mr.
justice
stewart
says
there
was
no
majority
expression
of
a
joint
position
in
that
case.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
right.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that's
what
i
understand.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
that's
the
issue
and
your
honor,
if
the
court
feels
that
the
statute
could
not
bear
an
interpretation
that
this
major
emphasis,
as
i
see
mr.
gillette's
position,
the
war
triggered
his
thinking
about
in
1964
when
he
registered
he
said
nothing.
that
was
in
the
very
beginning
of
1964.
it
was
before
the
war
had
actually
heated
up
after
the
gulf
of
tonkin
resolution.
now
he
developed
his
position,
he
has
watched
the
war
as
he
said.
i
mean,
this
had
an
effect
on
his
thinking,
and
he
became
convinced
as
a
result
of
what
he
was
witnessing
as
he
said,
as
the
board
said,
he
had
watched
it
on
the
news
media,
on
tv,
and
over
the
radio,
he
have
read
the
newspapers,
this
had
a
profound
effect
on
him.
he
didn't
claim
that
he
had
read
all
the
philosophers'
life
as
sisson.
sisson
made,
he
had
gotten
his
masters
in
philosophy,
and
no
doubt,
he
had
a
more
systematic
background.
but
this
young
man
became
convinced
as
he
lived
through
the
events
very
curiously
everyday.
and
that's
how
he
formed
his
conviction,
and
as
he
said,
as
he
testified,
before
the
draft
board
when
he
was
questioned,
he
had
gotten
through
the
vietnam
war,
a
feeling
against
war.
now
that
is
a
position,
i
think,
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of.
now
it
maybe
that
on
ballots
the
draft
board's
finding
should
be
accepted.
now
if
it
is
accepted,
then
and
if
the
statute
cannot
bear
the
interpretation
that
a
person
religiously
motivated
in
the
sense
of
the
seeger
case,
can
be
a
conscientious
objector
if
the
main
thrust
of
his
feeling
is
against
the
war
in
which
he
is
faced
with.
as
he
said,
i
am
against
the
war,
because
this
is
the
war
that
i
am
faced
with.
if
it
cannot
be
of
that
interpretation,
then,
of
course,
i
don't
see
how
the
statute
can
stand
under
the
first
amendment
because
there
is
no
question,
but
that
they
have
this
position,
this
particular
religious
view
that
he
has
is
sincerely
held,
and
to
deny
him
the
right
to
be
a
conscientious
objector
when
others
are
granted
it
who
have
a
more
general
position.
although
in
my
opinion,
a
person
who
is
so
careful
as
he
was
to
make
claim
that
he
didn't
foreclose
the
possibility,
that
he
might
defend
his
country,
if
it
were
actually
attacked,
i
would
say
that
this
is
profound
and
is
a
position
of
that
meriting
as
great
due
respect
as
any
possible
position.
now
in
the
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
what
i
would
--
i
would
say
about
one
quarter
whole
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
yes,
it
does,
because
as
he
made
it
plain
to
the
draft
board
and,
as
we
quote
in
this,
he
said,
"i
would
not
take
part
in
the
war
effort."
that
means
in
other
words,
if
he
weren't
in
the
continent
of
the
united
states,
he
would
be
taking
the
place
of
a
man
who
would
be
serving.
and
what
his
thrust
was
as
you
may
notice
by
all
his
statements,
and
the
statements
of
the
the
draft
board
itself,
his
criticism
is
not
of
any
danger
to
himself.
his
criticism
and
his
feeling,
his
moral
revulsion
is
directed
towards
what
is
happening
to
the
people
over
there.
at
no
time
did
the
draft
board
say,
and
in
no
time
did
he
express
any
feeling
about
his
own
safety
that
he
doesn't
want
to
participate.
he
was
opposed
to
taking
part
in
the
war
effort
as
a
whole
because
that's
really
--
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
of
course
not,
but
because
this
war
has
affected
his
belief
to
such
a
degree
that
he
cannot
take
any
part
whatsoever
in
its
support.
therefore
he
could
not
conscientiously
say
even
over
here
because
he
would
be
replacing
a
man
who
might
very
well
participate
in
that
portion
of
it,
which
greatly
revokes
his
feelings
and
i
think
that
this
is
not
only,
he
has
this
right
not
just
because
of
statute.
i
think
he
has
this
right
under
the
first
amendment
because
where
you
have
conceded
that
this
is
a
religiously
motivated
impulse.
then
you
recognize
the
supremacy
of
conscience
and
the
one
parallel
case
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge,
chief
justice
charles
evans
hughes
in
us
against
macintosh,
speaking
for
himself
and
stone
and
holmes
and
brandeis,
and
that
position
i
think
was
later
adopted
by
judge
douglas
in
writing
the
majority
opinion
in
girouard,
and
where
this
person
had
said
that
he
could
not
take
an
oath
to
participate
in
all
wars
that
his
conscience
would
have
to
determine
whether
he
could
take,
and
of
course,
he
was
denied
the
right
to
become
a
citizen.
but
in
the
girouard
case,
of
course
the
court
held
that
the
domain
of
conscience
is
supreme
reading.
a
brief
from
the
opinion
in
the
--
reading
briefly
from
the
opinion
which
was
adopted
in
girouard
case,
reading
from
the
judge
hughes
opinion.
"undoubtedly
in
the
forum
of
conscience,
duty
to
a
moral
power
higher
than
the
state
has
always
been
maintained."
so
i
think
that
the
unites
states
constitution
recognizes
in
the
first
amendment,
this
right
of
conscience
and
as
was
said
by
stone
in
his
great
essay
which
was
quoted
in
the
seeger
case.
a
state
should,
a
state
that
we
can
support,
should
recognize
this
supremacy
of
the
conscience.
all
of
our
history,
he
says,
which
is
quoted
in
seeger
at
page
170.
"all
our
history
gives
confirmation
to
the
view
that
liberty
of
conscience
has
a
moral
and
social
value
which
makes
it
worthy
of
preservation
at
the
hands
of
the
state.
so
deep
in
its
significance
and
vital,
indeed,
is
it
to
the
integrity
of
man's
moral
and
spiritual
nature
that
nothing
short
of
the
self-preservation
of
the
state
should
warrant
its
violation.
and
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
the
state
which
preserves
its
life
by
a
settled
policy
of
violation
of
the
conscience
of
the
individual
will
not
in
fact
ultimately
lose
it
by
the
process."
i
think
this
is
the
core
of
the
position
of
this
petition.
mr.
conrad
j.
lynn
i
just
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
draft
board
in
this
case
was
--
disqualified
him
because
he
said,
mr.
gillette,
that
it
was
the
vietnam
war,
that
forced
him
to
have
was
the
motivating
force
from
having
a
conscientious
objector
position.
to
conclude
from
that,
that
it
was
only
this
war
he
is
objected
to,
i
think
is
an
extension
of
what
was
really
said
and
it
was
a
conclusion
on
the
part
of
a
draft
board
which
i
think
was
unjustified.
and
secondly,
i
might
point
out
that
in
seeger
and
not
weaving
of
welsh
altogether
but
in
seeger,
it
was
acknowledged
that
political
considerations
might
very
well
form
a
part
of
the
base
of
conscience.
how
can
one
in
our
time
and
especially
young
man,
was
so
must
think
deeply
about
these
problems
completely
put
aside
any
political
consideration
in
coming
to
a
moral
stage
in
their
conscience.
and
i
think
it
would
be
--
it's
artificial
to
say
that
there
must
be
no
political
consideration
at
all
before
a
conscientious
objection
is
recognized.
