justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
a
little
off
what
you
are
arguing?
is
there
any
dispute
that
the
catholic
doctrine,
as
a
doctrine
compels
and
recognizes
selective
objection
to
wars?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
am
leaving
out
the
legal
argument.
i
am
asking
about
religious
tenant.
in
other
words
is
this
not
unlike
the
other
case,
a
purely
religiously
based
objection?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
am
getting
here.
and
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general,
who
doesn't
answer
the
case,
of
course.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
didn't
suppose
there
was
at
least
as
i
read
the
briefs
any
dispute
about
that.
my
only
point
is,
this
is
not
a
seeger
type
or
a
seeger
type
or
a
welsh
type
conscientious
objection?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
where
the
argument
that
he
uses
is
not
the
consequence
of
acceptance
(inaudible)
selected
by
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
is
not
testing
these
religious
based
(inaudible)
objection
or
sincerity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
solicitor
general,
are
there
any
figures,
just
to
the
number
of
selective
conscientious
objector
claims
that
have
been
made
since,
it
was
asked
in
the
sisson
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
know
what
the
army
has
been
doing
with
these
selective
claims?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
you
lose
this
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
think
you
are
quite
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
we
still
have
the
issue
in
the
other
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
solicitor
general,
has
there
ever
been
a
period
in
the
history
where
congress
has
denied
any
conscientious
objection
status?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
the
doubt
that
congress
could
do
so
if
it
wished?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
statute
does
specifically
exclude
that
objection
based
on
political
opposition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
suggesting
is
if
understand
your
argument,
you
are
saying
that
the
selective
conscientious
objective
runs
pretty
close
to
the
specific
thing
that
would
run
into
this
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
part
--
justice
john
m.

can
i
ask
you
a
