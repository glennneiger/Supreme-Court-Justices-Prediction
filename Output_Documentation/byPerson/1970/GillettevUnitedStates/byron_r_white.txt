justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harrington,
the
church
here
doesn't
select
the
war
that
are
sensible
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
leaves
it
to
the
individual
conscientious
of
its
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
leaves
the
individual
free
to
exercise
his
conscience
based
on
any
matter,
that
he
wants
to
claim
or
relate
it
to
conscience?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
church
has
taken
the
position
on
the
vietnam
war
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
it
hasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
about
the
church's
instructions
about
how
you
go
about
figuring
what
is,
how
you
decide
whether
you
are
consciously
opposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
gives
no
instructions
about
the
factors
that
go
in
though
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
says
be
careful.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
based
on
--
that
in
each
case
it's
the
individual's
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
be
exercised?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
i
still
--
do
i
gather
that
if
the
army
had
a
provision
for
a
recognized
selective
conscientious
objectors
and
said
we
will
not
send
you
to
vietnam,
we'll
send
you
somewhere
else.
i
take
it
or
am
i
wrong
in
saying
that
you
suggest,
that
would
satisfy
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
are
--
does
your
client
object
to
just
going
to
vietnam?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
being
assigned
to
duty
with
the
occupation
forces
in
europe?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
if
he
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
scope
of
his
objection
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
might
object
to
a
lot
of
other
kinds
of
military
services
but
at
least
you
know
he
is
objecting
to
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
those
doctrines
some
catholics,
if
they
follow
the
doctrines
will
be
conscientiously
obligated
to
go
to
the
vietnam
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
an
another
group
will
be
conscientiously
obligated
not
to
go
to
the
vietnam.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
both
are
acting
with
--
on
your
analysis,
religiously?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
congress
has
no
constitutional
power
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
just
limit
yourself
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
have
a
first
amendment
claim,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
still
say,
it's
a
personal
moral
code?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
that
his
refusal
to
participate
in
the
vietnam
war,
you
concede
is
based
on
a
religious
belief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
true.
that
maybe
good
for
statutory
construction,
but
how
about
the
constitutional
argument
of
discriminating
between
one
religion
and
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
between
one
religious
belief
and
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
if
both
of
those
beliefs
you
just
described,
you
concede
are
religious?
you
concede
that
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let's
assume
two
men
both
refused
to
go
to
vietnam,
and
they
say
--
one
of
them
says,
the
reason
is
i
religiously
oppose
war
in
any
form,
and
the
other
one
says,
based
on
my
religious
beliefs,
i
object
to
the
vietnam
war
and
will
not
go
to
the
vietnam
war.
you
apparently
concede
that
both
beliefs
motivating
the
refusal
are
religious
beliefs,
but
the
one
you
would
say
is
entitled
to
recognition
and
the
other
one
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
how
do
you
justify
the
discriminating
between
those
two
religious
beliefs
motivating
refusals
to
go
to
the
vietnam
war?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
that's
right
under
the
statute,
but
when
you
ask
to
how
--
if
you
ask
why
the
statue
is
so
construed
and
applied
is
constitutional,
why
is
it
constitutional
to
discriminates
between
one
religious
belief
and
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
the
other
case,
in
the
gillette
case
there
was
no
finding
in
neither
the
courts
below
as
whether
or
not
a
religious
belief
was
involved.
but
you
don't
challenge
it,
but
if
that
were
determined
that
there
wasn't
a
religious
belief
involved,
we
wouldn't
be
reaching
to
some
of
these
questions
in
that
case
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
harlan
expressly
rejected
the
statutory
position
expressed
by
mr.
justice
black?
justice
