well,
mr.
harrington
suppose,
one,
we
give
you
all
the
relief
you
want
and
two,
a
very
short
order
(inaudible)
involved
with
the
war
in
the
middle
east,
will
we
then
have
a
choice
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
whether
or
not,
even
though,
i
fought
in
vietnam,
i
don't
want
to
fight
in
middle
east
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
this
hypothetical
man
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
a
religious
choice
is
now
on
wanting
to
control
the
ability
of
the
army
to
assign
its
men
already
in
battle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
any
case
before
this
where
a
man
in
the
army
has
had
right
to
decide
where
he
was
going
to
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
if
we
will
refuse
then
the
army
has
to
give
guy
a
choice
where
he
is
going
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
to
the
two
men
in
the
same
position
as
this
man
and
both
of
them
are
against
the
war
in
vietnam
and
one
is
catholic
and
one
is
some
other
religion,
catholic
wins
and
the
other
man
loses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
presbyterian
religion
that
says
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assume
it
does.
just
on
his
own
mind,
he
feels
the
same
way
as
your
petitioner
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
believes
in
god
and
he
believes
that
god
gives
him
the
right
to
decide
which
war
he
is
going
to
fight
in.
if
he
can't
show
that
in
his
presbyterian
religion,
he
is
a
dead
presbyterian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position,
why
are
you
expending
two-third
of
your
time
catholic
religion?
justice
thurgood

my
brother
stewart,
i
don't
get
it.
