based
on
a
later
religion,
on
an
older
religion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
dose
the
catholic
church
decide
that
this
is
not
a
just
war?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
not
come
down
to
the
fact
as
you
say
because
a
man
can
under
the
catholic
church,
need
not
object
to
particular
war,
it's
left
up
to
him
entirely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
rely
either
on
the
the
prevailing
of
four-man
opinion
in
welsh
or
seeger
to
support
that
view
point?
justice
hugo
l.

that's
right,
religion.
justice

l.
black
church's
religious
objection
which
you
say
(inaudible)
the
individuals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
means
that
any
man
has
a
right
in
the
united
states
to
determine
whether
you
go
to
any
war
at
all,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
quakers
believe
--
quakers
have
this
objection
doctrine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
what
they
call
it,
but.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
always
understood
that
they
have
told
that
you
didn't,
you
shouldn't
engage
in
a
war
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
leave,
and
i
am
not
going
to
saying
you
are
right
or
wrong,
would
that
not
leave
every
individual
in
the
nation
to
decide
whether
he
would
serve
in
a
war
or
not,
wouldn't
it
validate
the
entire
draft
system?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
a
quaker,
i
am
talking
about
any
religion.
if
they
all
leave
the
man
free
to
go
a
war
or
not
as
he
sees
fit,
how
could
they
be
in
a
draft
system,
even
if
the
congress
wanted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
most
of
them
might
not,
but
suppose
a
more
and
more
until
98%
of
them
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
would
change
that
statute,
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
you
are
right,
because
i
don't
know
any
thing
about
the
doctrine
but
i
have
no
poor
thought
that
it
was
part
of
catholic
doctrine,
every
member
of
that
church
was
left
free
to
obey
a
law
and
not
obey
it
as
he
saw
fit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
very
few
of
the
individual
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
church
hasn't
taken
a
position
on
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
mr.
solicitor
general?
you
know
or
know
better
than
the
solicitor
general,
even
the
members
of
the
court,
(inaudible)
of
these
cases.
i
do
not
understand
why
this
man
has
gotten
what
he
wants
and
he
is
not
being
compelled
to
apply,
this
wouldn't
be
moot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
near
so
sure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
the
man
is
where
he
wants
to
be.
he
is
objected
to
going
into
the
war
and
army
has
kept
him.
i
don't
see
where
he
is
has
any
controversy
at
the
present
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
why
we
should
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
the
alternative
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
church
was
that?
you
are
speaking
about
another
church,
what
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
the
baptist
church
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said,
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
permit?
why
wouldn't
that
absolutely
prevent
the
government
and
i
am
not
saying
it
shouldn't
prevented
or
should,
why
would
that
absolutely
make
it
impossible
for
the
government
have
law
drafting
an
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
until
they
get,
i
believe
some
of
them
keep
that
opinion,
and
believe
in
draft?
justice
hugo

black

a
war.

well,
i
don't
see
--
i
thought
they

getting
mixed
up
in
this

well
that's
a
newly

--
justice

that
must
be
a
newly

idea
of

out?
