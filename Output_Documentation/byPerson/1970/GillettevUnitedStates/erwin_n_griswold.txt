mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
before
opening
my
argument
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
clarify
two
things
which
came
up
in
the
previous
argument
and
which
are
relevant
here.
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
a
fact
that
there
is
in
the
statute,
a
reference
to
a
purely
personal
moral
code.
i
was
a
little
vague
in
my
answer.
i
now
had
a
chance
to
find
the
statutory
language.
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case,
the
negre
case
on
page
1a
at
the
back,
“and
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
require
any
person
to
be
subject
to
combatant
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
who
by
a
reason
by
religious
training
and
belief
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,”
and
then
comes
this
sentence
which
was
unfortunately
omitted
in
the
printing
of
our
brief,
“as
used
in
this
sub-section,
the
term
religious
training
and
belief
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.”
it
was
because
the
way
the
statute
has
put
it
as
the
definition
of
religious
training
and
belief
which
we
are
not
questioning
here,
rather
than
as
having
something
to
do
with
that
participation
in
war
in
any
form
that
i
omitted
it
before.
formally,
verbally
that's
the
way
it
is
limited.practically,
it
seems
to
me
to
give
some
indication
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
in
formulating
the
provision
itself
and
then
there
was
a
question
to
me
as
to
whether
congress
had
ever
refused
to
allow
conscientious
objection.
this
is
covered
on
pages
34
to
36
of
the
supplement
to
the
brief
which
we
filed
in
the
welsh
case
which
we
printed
the
brief
in
the
seeger
case
which
gave
a
detailed
treatment
of
the
history.
the
fact
is
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war,
military
service
was
a
state
matter
and
you
will
remember,
it
was
always
the
7th
massachusetts
in
the
23rd
ohio
and
so
on.
thereafter,
congress
said
and
some
states
had
conscientious
objector
provisions
and
others
had
different
ones,
thereafter
congress
provided
for
a
draft,
but
at
the
beginning
it
provided
that
you
could
provide
substitutes
and
a
great
many
of
the
conscientious
objectors
apparently
provided
substitutes.
finally,
thereafter,
during
the
civil
war,
congress
enacted
the
statute
which
was
typical
of
the
form
right
down
through
the
world
war
ii,
“that
members
of
religious
denominations
who
shall
by
oath
or
affirmation
declare
that
they
are
conscientiously
opposed
to
the
bearing
of
arms
and
who
are
prohibited
from
doing
so
by
the
rules
and
the
articles
of
faith
and
practice
of
said
religious
denominations
shall
when
drafted
into
the
military
service,
be
considered
non-combatants
and
shall
be
assigned
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
duty
in
the
hospitals
or
to
the
care
of
freed
men
or
shall
pay
the
sum
of
$300
to
such
persons
as
the
secretary
of
war
shall
designate
to
receive
it,
to
be
applied
to
the
benefit
of
the
sick
and
wounded
soldiers.
provided
no
person
shall
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
provision
to
this
section,
unless
his
declaration
of
conscientious
scruples
against
bearing
arms
shall
be
supported
by
satisfactory
evidence
that
his
department
has
been
uniformly
consistent
with
such
declaration.”
now
turning
to
this
case,
i
think
though
it
is
someways
more
complicated,
it
presents
essentially
the
same
legal
issue
as
the
preceding
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
within
what
sense
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
political
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
it
is,
and
i
think
it
is
the
essence
of
our
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
the
--
i
hate
to
get
into
what
is
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church.
i
don't
think
it
is
relevant
to
for
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
an
expert
on
it,
but
it
is
insofar
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
just
and
unjust
wars
which
has
a
theological
significance.
however,
the
church
as
i
understand
it
does
not
make
that
choice
for
the
individual,
and
that
choice
i
suggest
is
on
a
different
level,
and
the
determination
of
the
church
between
just
and
unjust
wars,
that
choice
is
a
personal
choice.
and
if
the
individual's
choice
is
a
selective
conscientious
objection,
he
is
not
covered
by
the
statute
anymore
than
is
a
quaker
who
might
make
the
same
choice.
a
quaker
--
the
quaker
religion,
insofar
as
it
is
formalized
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
form,
but
there
are
many
good
quakers
who
have
served
in
wars,
powell
douglas
served
actively
in
world
war
ii,
herbert
hoover
was
commander-in-chief
of
the
army
and
navy
and
if
a
quaker
says,
yes,
i
understand
that's
the
teaching
of
my
church,
but
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it's
a
selective
matter,
i
will
serve
in
some
wars
and
not
in
other
wars,
then
he
would
not
be
covered
by
this
statute
either.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
precisely,
precisely
our
position.
that
is
what
congress
has
said.
congress
has
said
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
and
the
issue
is
whether
he
is
opposed
to
all
participation
in
all
wars,
and
he
may
evidence
religion
as
a
reason
for
supporting
the
sincerity
of
his
view
that
he
is
opposed
to
all
wars,
but
if
he
asserts
as
mr.
negre
does,
that
he
is
not
opposed
to
all
wars,
but
he
is
opposed
to
this
war
then
he
doesn't
come
within
the
statute
whether
he
is
religiously
motivated
or
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
in
my
mind
that
mr.
negre
is
religiously
motivated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
say,
it
is
in
the
last
analysis
his
choice,
not
his
church's
choice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
it
is
not
a
religious
belief
which
leads
him
to
say
that
i
will
not
participate
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
does
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
does,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
discriminates
between
a
person
who
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
and
one
who
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
this
particular
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
broad
sense
which
is
the
result
of,
i
won't
say,
is
decided
by,
but
is
the
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
welsh
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
i
would
equally
say
that
the
belief
which
asserted
that
i
do
not
believe
in
any
supreme
being,
i
uphold
all
organized
religion,
however,
by
a
reason
of
deep
conscientious
feeling
i
have
concluded
that
i
will
not
participate
in
war
in
any
form,
would
likewise
be
protected.
whether
it
is
religion
in
the
conventional
sense
or
not,
makes
no
difference.
the
question
is
that
the
depth
of
the
view
and
the
nature
of
the
view.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
one
is
a
view
which
within
the
statutory
language
as
it
has
come
to
be
meant
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief,
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
--
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
the
other
is
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief,
however,
it's
construed,
is
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
we
are
discriminating
between
one
religious
belief
and
another,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
are
discriminating
between
one
belief
which
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
whether
it
is
supported
by
conventional
religion
or
not,
and
on
the
other
hand
a
--
an
opposition
to
participation
in
this
particular
war
whether
it
is
supported
by
conventional
religion
or
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that's
what
i
have
been
trying
to
say
whether
it
is
religious
or
not,
if
it
selective,
it
(a)
doesn't
come
within
the
statute,
and
(b)
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
congress
to
recognize
it
or
putting
it
another
way,
it
does
not
amount
to
an
establishment
of
religion
or
a
denial
of
the
free
exercise
of
a
religion
which
is
all
that
the
first
amendment
covers,
nor
is
it
invidious
discrimination,
insofar
as
there
is
an
equal
protection
concept
in
the
fifth
amendment.
now
it's
already
been
pointed
out
that
this
case
is
different
from
gillette
case
since
it
arises
in
habeas
corpus
and
is
not
a
criminal
case,
this
i
don't
think
makes
any
significant
difference.
it
is
based
on
a
directive
of
the
department
of
defense
and
army
regulations
which
provide
for
release
of
people
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
objection,
and
they
shall
be
judged
according
to
the
regulation
by
the
same
standards,
whether
made
before
or
after
entering
military
service,
and
that
these
shall
be
the
selective
service
system
standards.
thus
section
6
(j)
is
incorporated
into
the
relevant
military
regulations.
i
do
think
it
is
pertinent
to
point
out
again,
as
has
been
asserted,
as
has
been
stated
here
by
mr.
harrington
that
the
petitioner
is
no
longer
on
active
duty
in
the
army.
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
ready
reserve.
he
can
quite
readily
within
the
conscientious
scruples
which
he
showed
during
the
four
months
that
he
was
in
the
army,
where
he
was
willing
to
serve
in
uniform
on
this
side.
he
can
quite
readily
comply
with
the
military
requirement,
which
seem
to
me
that
if
he
doesn't,
it
is
simply
a
clear
case
of
military
disobedience
which
ought
to
be
treated
as
such.
if
he
does
feel
that
his
views
have
now
changed,
so
that
he
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
any
form,
he
is
still
entitled
to
file
a
claim
based
upon
that.
i
do
not
understand
that
he
has
ever
made
any
such
claim.
now,
the
other
difference
between
this
case
and
the
gillette
case
as
already
pointed
out,
is
that
the
objection
in
the
present
case
has
a
clear
religious
basis
within
the
conventional
sense
of
that
term.
now
the
petitioner
is
a
catholic.
he
based
his
application
on
well
known
writings
of
traditional
catholic
authors,
including
the
present
pope
and
his
predecessor
pope
john
xxiii.
and
on
the
basis
of
these
writings
he
says,
that
each
catholic
must
form
his
own
conscience
in
respect
of
military
service,
and
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
just
and
unjust
wars.
on
this
basis,
he
concludes
that
he
cannot
conscientiously
participate
in
the
war
in
vietnam,
although
he
would
be
prepared
to
perform
noncombatant
hospital
service
in
the
united
states,
because
such
service
is
not
directly
in
aid
of
the
army
in
vietnam.
the
hearing
officer
found
that
he
was
a
devout
catholic,
who
sincerely
believed
that
the
war
in
vietnam
was
wrong.
he
concluded,
however,
that
the
application
for
discharge
should
be
rejected
because
in
his
opinion,
the
applicant
objected
to
a
particular
war
and
not
to
war
in
any
form,
and
this
was
supported
by
the
department
of
the
army.
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
pages
47
and
48
of
the
appendix,
read
the
or
recited
the
opinion
of
the
hearing
officer
and
concluded
that
it
is
a
fact
when
considered
together
with
other
facts
disclosed
in
the
record,
including
the
timing
of
the
application
and
petitioner's
request
for
noncombatant
status,
with
the
restriction
that
he
be
assigned
to
duties
in
the
united
states
that
these
could
sustain
the
opinion
of
the
hearing
officer
and
the
decision
of
the
army.
it
therefore
cannot
be
said
that
the
decision
of
the
army
is
without
a
basis,
in
fact,
they
are.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
on
page
51
of
the
appendix,
that
beyond
question
there
was
a
basis
in
fact,
for
the
conclusions
of
the
department
of
the
army.
it
further
pointed
out,
that
the
petitioner
objects
to
the
war
in
vietnam,
not
to
all
wars
and
clearly
his
views
are
completely
inconsistent
with
objection
to
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
i
know
of
no
such
figures.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not.
of
course,
we
have
two
groups.
we
have
those
before
the
selective
service
system,
which
would
follow
one
procedure.
we
have
those
seeking
release
from
the
army
which
would
follow
another
procedure.
those
come
in
at
least
four
or
may
be
five
different
services
and
i
do
not
know
if
any
effort
to
tabulate
the
expressly
selective
claims
which
have
been
made
since
judge
wyzanski's
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
share
that
feeling
to
a
very
considerable
extent.
this
man
is
in
the
ready
reserve.
there's
a
suggestion
here
by
mr.
harrington
not
supported
in
the
record,
i
mean
i
am
not
denying
it,
i
just
don't
know
it,
that
he
isn't
attending
his
drills
and
may
be
subject
to
an
order
of
call
up.
as
i
have
said
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
pure
case
of
military
disobedience.
he
has
never
made
a
claim
of
total
conscientious
objection.
this
is
never
been
passed
on
by
anyone.
his
claim
is
one
of
the
selective
conscientious
objection
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
effect
of
the
department
--
army
was
that
he
wouldn't
be
classified
as
1-ao,
that
is
as
a
noncombatant
in
the
military
services,
which
was
the
service
which
he
did
perform.
frankly,
i
don't
myself
understand
why
the
case
isn't
moot,
but
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
case
is
cited
in
the
footnotes,
have
had
a
chilling
effect
on
me
and
i
didn't
quite
feel
that
i
could
assert
that
the
case
was
moot
or
let
me
put
it
in
other
way,
if
i
had
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot,
i
would
have
thought
that
maybe
i
would
not
have
been
successful.
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
it
would
not
–
[laughter]
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
not
distress
me
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
case
was
moot.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
case,
where
the
court
is
being
called
on
to
decide
the
ultimate
question
of
principle
in
a
factual
situation
where
it
is
not
really
presented.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
he
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
he
is
trying
very
hard
to
get
a
decision
out
of
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
he
is
apparently
now,
not
complying
with
his
reserve
obligation,
in
order
that
he
maybe
called
back
into
active
service,
in
order
that
he
may
get
another
order
to
go
to
vietnam,
in
order
that
he
maybe
sure
that
the
issue
will
be
presented.
whether
that
possibility
which
turns
considerably
on
his
own
determination
to
get
a
decision
on
this
issue
is
sufficient
to
keep
the
case
from
being
moot,
is
something
which
the
court
ought
to
consider,
will
consider
of
course,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
much
reason
to
think
that
this
is
a
case
which
is
essentially
moot.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
still
have
--
not,
we
don't
have
the
catholic
doctrine
argument
in
the
other
case,
we
have
the
selective
conscientious.
but
i
think
the
catholic
doctrine
argument
can
be
highlighted
by
the
reply
brief
which
was
filed
in
this
case.
incidentally
it
is
full
of
learned
excerpts
from
catholic
authors
through
the
years,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
how
far
the
court
can
properly
take
judicial
notice
of
such
material.
if
it
is
relevant,
which
i
don't
think
it
is,
because
i
don't
think
the
court
can
go
into
church
doctrine
of
any
kind,
if
it
is
relevant,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
to
be
put
in
by
evidence,
it
ought
to
be
subject
to
examination
and
cross-examination,
and
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
to
put
in
other
teachings
of
other
prominent
catholic
theologians.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
very
confusing
mass
of
material
all
together
can
be
found
rather
than
the
selected
materials
which
are
here.
but
the
point
to
which
i
want
to
make
is
-–
can
be
seen
in
two
page
places
in
this
brief.
page
3,
the
heading,
this
is
the
blue
covered
reply
brief
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
its
members
have
a
religious
duty
to
participate
in
just
wars.
now,
if
there
were
that,
if
that
were
true,
there
would
be
a
problem.
among
other
things
they
couldn't
ever
be
a
catholic
conscientious
objector
within
the
statute.
he
would
always
say,
well,
i
will
participate
in
just
war,
and
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
mulloy
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
last
year,
involved
a
catholic
and
had
substantial
material
and
the
record
about
catholic
doctrine
and
he
claimed
to
be
a
total
conscientious
objector.
now,
we
have
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
another
case
which
is
now
pending,
raising
an
issue
like
this,
laird
against
capobianco,
number
611
which
also
involves
a
catholic
who
claims
to
be
a
total
conscientious
objector
and
i
think
that
the
light
comes
on
page
7
of
the
reply
brief.
this
is
a
place
where
there
was
an
error
in
the
printing
of
the
brief
and
the
material
has
in
my
copy
at
least
and
i
hope
in
yours
has
been
written
in
long
hand.
this
is
the
language
--
yes,
i
have
it
--
this
is
the
language
just
below
the
middle
of
page
7,
captain
vanvert
(ph)
right
at
the
middle
of
page
7,
captain
vanvert
(ph)
was
correct
in
capturing
the
theological
gist
of
the
teaching
of
paul
vi,
in
the
pastoral
constitution,
that
a
catholic
has
a
religious
duty
to
distinguish
between
just
wars
in
which
he
may
participate,
and
unjust
wars
in
which
he
has
a
religious
duty
to
refuse
to
participate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
am
sorry,
in
the
one
that
i
have,
it
says,
distinguish
and
the
one
that
mr.
harrington
has,
it
says,
discriminate
and
i
don't
know
whether
they
couldn't
make
up
their
mind
or
whether
[laughter]
whether
it
was
an
error.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
which
he
may
participate,
i
believe
that
is
an
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
i
am
sorry,
mr.
harrington's
copy.
this
is
interesting
because
apparently
there
was
a
change
in
view
as
they
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
the
copy
that
was
furnished
to
me
has
the
language
on
which
i
have
based
my
argument
and
which
i
will
stand
on
to
distinguish
between
just
wars
in
which
he
may
participate
and
unjust
wars
in
which
he
has
a
religious
duty
to
refuse
to
participate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
venture
the
suggestion
that
the
sound
theological
doctrine
is
that
a
catholic
may
participate
in
all
wars,
that
in
part
catholic
may
decline
to
participate
in
all
wars
and
that
he
is
not
under
a
religious
duty
to
participate
in
just
wars.
that
he
does
have
a
considerable
freedom
of
conscience
and
i
haven't
the
slightest
doubt
that
that
is
the
practical
construction
which
has
been
given
not
only
by
many
individual
catholics,
but
by
their
religious
advisors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
depends
upon
what
the
decision
in
the
welsh
case
means
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
five
members
of
the
court
on
one
ground
or
another
have
determined
that
the
word
religious
training
and
belief
in
the
statute
do
not
have
much
significance.
four
because
they
don't
think
they
should
have
and
one
because
he
thinks
that
constitutionally,
they
can't
have
and
all
that
we
on
this
side
of
the
bar
can
do
is
to
undertake
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
which
was
reached
for
varying
reasons
by
five
members
of
the
court,
which
did
in
effect
ride
out
from
the
statute,
the
word
religious
training
and
belief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
have
no
more
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
i
believe
presents
again
the
problem
which
was
not
decided
last
term
in
unites
states
against
sisson
and
welsh.
the
question
which
maybe
summarized
is
that
of
the
selective
conscientious
objector;
the
objector
to
a
particular
war
who
does
not
claim
to
be
fundamentally
opposed
to
all
war.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
no
contention
that
his
beliefs
here
are
not
religiously
based
as
that
word
was
adumbrated
in
the
welsh
case.
and
i
believe
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
adumbrated
means
stated
in
the
cloudy
fashion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
why
i
said
adumbrated
in
the
welsh
case.
four
members
of
the
court
construed
the
words
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
four
other
members
of
the
court
disagreed
with
that
but
one
of
them
held
that
the
--
in
order
to
maintain
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
it
must
be
treated
as
if
they
weren't
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
whatever
the
effect
of
it
is,
we
make
no
contention
that
this
is
not
religiously
based
within
the
meaning
of
the
seeger
case
and
i
say
the
welsh
case,
whatever
it
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
course,
i
do
not
seek
to
resolve
that
difference
except
that
the
consequence
was
that
in
one
case,
in
the
case
of
four
justices
on
ground
to
statutory
construction
and
in
the
case
of
a
fifth
judge
on
what
i
think,
must
be
said
to
be
statutory
construction
compelled
by
the
constitution,
the
result
was
reached
that
the
effect
of
religious
training
and
belief
in
the
statute
shall
i
say,
qualify.
at
any
rate
as
so
qualified,
we
raise
no
contention
that
it
was
not
religiously
based
here.
the
question
arises
here
because
of
the
finding
of
the
district
court
and
this
appears
on
page
13
of
the
appendix.
no,
i
made
a
claim
that
i
think
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
board
concluding
that
whatever
moral
views
were
held,
they
were
directed
to
the
vietnam
war.
now
this
case
was
tried
before
judge
wyatt
with
a
jury.
it
lead
to
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
only
issue
which
judge
wyatt
submitted
to
the
jury
was
the
question
whether
he
willfully
failed
to
comply
within
order
to
report
for
induction
and
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
before
this
court,
was
whether
judge
wyatt
made
any
errors
of
law
in
connection
with
the
conduct
of
the
trial,
leading
up
to
that
submission
to
the
jury.
and
the
only
error
of
law
which
is
suggested
relates
to
this
question
of
selective
conscientious
objection
which
is
embodied
in
that
ruling
of
judge
wyatt
which
appears
on
page
13
of
the
record.
similarly,
the
court
of
appeals
treated
it
on
the
same
basis.
at
page
20
of
the
appendix,
the
second
paragraph
on
the
page,
the
court
of
appeal
says
evidence
derived
from
gillette's
selective
service
file
and
from
his
testimony,
before
judge
wyatt,
reveals
that
gillette's
beliefs
were
based
on
humanism
and
that's
within
the
welsh
case,
and
were
specifically
directed
against
the
war
in
vietnam
which
raises
the
selective
conscientious
objection
issue.
the
statutory
provision
involved
here
seems
to
be
rather
clear.
it
is
section
6
(j)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967,
which
grants
exemption
from
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
to
any
person
found
by
his
local
board
to
be
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief,
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
all
of
the
applicable
factors,
the
statutory
construction
point
to
the
conclusion
that
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
or
construction,
this
passage
of
the
statute,
particularly
the
last
three
words,
should
be
construed
to
mean
what
it
seems
to
say.
i
suggest
that
this
conclusion
is
supported
on
at
least
five
grounds.
one,
the
language
of
the
statute
in
any
form.
two
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
really
makes
much
difference,
but
i
do
think
it
is
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
where
it
lies
in
the
statute.
it
doesn't
say
participation
in
any
form
in
war.
i
don't
think
it
would
make
much
difference
if
it
did.
if
you
can't
participate
in
any
form
in
war,
you
are
totally
conscientious
objecting,
if
you
can't
participate
in
war
in
any
form,
you
are
totally
conscientious
objecting.
and
second,
the
long
history
of
provisions
of
this
sort
and
third;
the
more
immediate
legislative
history,
fourth;
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
and
fifth;
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
respected
courts
and
judges.
and
first,
the
language
of
the
statute;
as
i
have
indicated
it
says
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
the
words
are
simple
and
sweeping,
in
any
form.
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
legislative
intent
could
have
been
more
clearly
put.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
in
the
light
of
all
the
setting
as
just
what
congress
really
meant.
the
very
shortness
and
simplicity
of
the
language
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
it
means
what
it
says.
there
is
no
ambiguity
here
as
such
as
the
court
found
in
the
words
religious
training
and
belief
or
at
least
some
members
of
the
court
found
in
the
words
religious
training
and
belief
involved
in
the
welsh
case
and
next,
we
have
the
history
of
provision
to
this
sort.
they
go
back
at
least
to
1775
when
the
continental
congress
adopted
a
resolution
to
honor
the
conscientious
of
those
who
"from
religious
principles
cannot
bear
arms
in
any
case"
and
all
of
our
early
legislation
on
conscientious
objection
was
in
terms
of
members
of
the
historic
peace
churches,
the
quakers,
the
mennonites
and
others.
all
of
whom
were
opposed
to
war
in
any
circumstances.
in
our
modern
view,
the
exemption
cannot
be
limited
to
members
of
particular
churches.
it
must
be
extended
to
all
those
whose
views
are
"religious"
in
a
broad
and
deeply
held
sense,
including
humanism.
but
this
is
no
reason
for
changing
the
scope
of
the
exemption
which
has
always
involved
opposition
to
war
"in
any
form."
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
that
history
is
outlined
in
detail
and
the
appendix
to
the
seeger
brief
filed
five
years
ago.
i
read
that
through
in
connection
with
the
welsh
case.
i
don't
recall
that
there
has
ever
been
a
period
when
the
conscientious
objection
was
completely
denied.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
have
no
doubt
myself
that
congress
could
do
so
and
you
and
the
court
generation
ago
said
so,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
decision
on
that
point.
next,
i
turn
to
the
more
immediate
legislative
history.
at
the
time
of
world
war
i,
senator
la
follette
proposed
an
amendment
which
would
have
granted
exemption
on
the
ground
of
a
conscientious
objection
to
the
undertaking
of
combatant
service
in
the
present
war
and
this
was
rejected
by
the
senate
and
no
changes
have
since
been
made
in
the
statute.
it
continues
to
be
applicable
to
those
who
are
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
then
there
are
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
as
congress
saw
when
senator
la
follette's
amendment
was
proposed
in
1917,
there
is
a
great
practical
difference,
a
difference
in
kind
between
opposition
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
opposition
to
a
particular
war.
how
particular
must
the
war
be?
in
world
war
ii,
could
a
person
have
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
the
war
in
europe
and
africa,
but
not
opposed
to
the
war
in
the
pacific
on
the
ground
that
the
japanese
had
attacked
us,
but
we
hadn't
been
attacked
in
europe
and
africa.
or
could
he
on
sincere
religious
grounds
have
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
air
war
because
it
affected
civilians,
but
was
not
to
opposed
to
ground
war.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
could
he
successfully,
could
he
have
come
within
the
language
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
can
it
be
practically
determined
how
sincere
he
is,
whether
he
really
is
sincere,
particularly,
when
the
external
earmark
of
conventional
religion
has
been
taken
away
from
the
test.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no,
there
is
no
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
but
i
am
talking
about
the
question
of
construing
this
statute
as
to
whether
the
words
in
any
form
mean,
shall
i
say
in
any
form.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
if
they
are
construed
to
mean
some
thing
other
than
that,
that
the
practical
questions
which
will
be
raised
in
other
cases,
not
in
this
case
but
in
other
cases,
will
be
very
serious.
congress
is
expressly
given
power
by
the
constitution
to
raise
and
support
armies
but
how
is
it
possible
to
do
this
as
a
practical
matter.
if
each
man
must
be
asked,
each
time
he
is
ordered
to
a
specific
duty,
whether
he
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
this
particular
segment
of
war
and
i
don't
say
of
the
war,
i
say,
of
war.
in
this
connection,
it
maybe
pointed
out
that
it
is
not
possible
to
know
now,
whether
either
the
petitioner
here
or
the
petitioner
in
the
next
case
would
ever
be
sent
to
vietnam,
if
he
should
see
service
in
the
army.
not
all
drafted
men
by
any
means
are
sent
to
vietnam.
the
country
has
many
other
responsibilities
throughout
the
world
,
which
require
the
maintenance
of
large
units
of
the
armed
forces
in
many
places,
in
germany
and
elsewhere
in
europe,
in
korea,
in
the
philippines,
in
hawaii
and
many
other
bases
in
this
country
and
in
the
arctic
and
in
the
mediterranean.
it
is
hard
to
see
on
what
basis
the
petitioners
can
claim
exemption
from
combatant
or
non-combatant
training,
when
they
would
conscientiously
accept
some
combatant
or
non-combatant
service.
and
finally,
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
which
construe
the
statutory
language
the
way
it
reads.
perhaps,
the
best
known
of
these
is
that
by
the
great
judge
augustus
hand
in
his
opinion
in
united
states
against
kauten,
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
where
he
said
that
a
belief
is
sufficient
to
qualify
for
a
conscientious
objector
status
must
be
a
general
scruple
is
"against
participation
in
war
in
any
form,"
and
not
merely
an
objection
to
participation
in
the
particular
war.
now,
this
interpretation
has
been
followed
in
a
number
of
cases,
also
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
including
the
two
cases,
the
two
courts
below
in
the
cases
now
before
the
court.
there
is
also
the
well
known
passage
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
concurred
in
by
justices
stone
and
brandeis
in
hamilton
against
regents,
and
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
quoting
with
the
approval
from
united
states
against
macintosh.
and
this
seems
to
have
been
the
unanimous
view
of
the
court
in
the
welsh
case,
as
we
have
indicated
by
references
to
the
three
opinions
in
that
case
on
page
19
of
our
brief.
and
since
the
proper
construction
of
the
statued,
shows
that
congress
has
determined
to
limit
the
exemption.
the
remaining
question
before
the
court
is,
whether
this
legislative
judgment
runs
afoul
of
some
constitutional
command.
now,
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
turning
to
the
constitutional
argument,
we
note
first,
that
the
constitution
in
simple
but
broad
and
unqualified
terms
gives
the
congress
power
to
raise
and
support
armies.
this
has
been
then
broadly
construed
by
this
court,
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases
and
more
recently
in
united
states
against
o'brien.
the
chief
ground
for
limitation
suggested
here,
is
that
of
religious
freedom
under
the
first
amendment.
this
court
has
declared
that
congress
need
grant
no
exemption
to
conscientious
objectives
at
all
in
hamilton
against
regents,
and
united
states
against
macintosh.
i
am
glad
that
congress
does
provide
an
exemption
for
conscientious
objectors.
indeed
my
principal
concern
about
this
case,
is
that
if
the
exemption
is
pushed
to
unintended
and
impractical
lengths
it
may
jeopardize
the
whole
concept
of
the
exemption,
which
has
in
fact
worked
rather
remarkably
well
over
a
period
of
close
to
200
years.
when
there
was,
as
there
was
for
a
long
time,
an
essentially
religious
meaning
to
the
phrase
religious
training
and
belief,
then
there
was
an
external
standard
which
could
be
used
with
some
objectivity
in
determining
the
sincerity
of
the
claim.
now,
that
is
largely
gone.
if
selective
conscientious
objection
has
to
be
recognized,
the
external
standards
almost
completely
disappear.
it
then
becomes
almost
entirely
a
matter
of
personal
preference
or
choice.
many
personal
choices
are
passionately
held,
sincerely
and
conscientiously
maintained.
indeed,
one
of
the
comments
often
made
about
youth
is
that
they
readily
convert
any
matter
of
choice
or
preference
into
a
matter
of
sincerity
or
conscientious.
one
of
the
problems
about
a
conscientious
objector
system
is
to
administer
it
fairly,
fairly
to
those
who
go
as
well
as
to
those
who
are
allowed
to
engage
in
alternative
service.
it
needs
to
be
remembered
that
for
every
conscientious
objector,
for
every
conscientious
objector
there
is
a
man
called
to
serve
who
would
not
otherwise
be
called.
he
isn't
here,
he
isn't
before
us
but
in
every
case,
it
is
a
choice
between
this
man
and
some
other
man.
if
it
becomes
impossible
to
administer
the
system
fairly,
then
congress
may
conclude
that
it
should
be
terminated.
many
would
agree
i
think
that,
that
would
be
unfortunate.
in
the
terms
of
the
first
amendment,
there
are
two
aspects,
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
both
the
history
and
the
practice
with
respect
to
conscientious
objector
provisions
show
that
congress
was
seeking
to
accommodate
rather
than
to
establish
religion.
this
is
indeed
the
effect
of
the
welsh
case.
to
make
it
clear
that
no
form
of
religion
or
non-religion,
as
long
as
it
is
deeply
held,
is
given
special
treatment.
no
religion
is
favored,
none
is
discriminated
against,
and
none
as
established.
in
excluding
selective
objectors,
there
is
no
religious
preference,
no
religious
discrimination.
no
one
is
called
because
he
holds
a
particular
religion,
no
one
is
exempted
because
he
holds
a
particular
religion.
what
the
statute
does,
is
to
recognize
a
qualitative
difference
between
general
and
selective
objection
without
regard
to
religion.
if
the
claim
is
deeply
and
sincerely
held,
selective
conscientious
objection
necessarily
involves
a
form
of
political
judgment.
a
conclusion
in
opposition
to
the
policy
reached
by
the
duly
elected
government,
with
respect
to
a
particular
area
at
a
certain
time,
under
stated
conditions.
though
the
response
may
be
religiously
or
conscientiously
motivated,
it
rests
in
the
first
instance
on
a
decision
that
is
particular
and
political.
in
contrast,
those
who
conscientiously
oppose
participation
in
combat
in
any
form
do
not
invoke
the
same
type
of
contemporary
political
judgment.
there
objection
is
to
war,
all
the
war,
independent
of
place,
time
or
circumstance.
we
have
here
a
particular
form
of
selective
objection,
but
there
could
be
others.
objections
to
particular
weapons
or
to
the
political
make
up
of
our
allies
in
any
war
or
to
combat
on
sunday
or
on
saturday.
congress
does
not
establish
or
disestablish
any
religion
when
it
says
that
such
matters
need
not
be
gone
into,
that
selective
conscientious
objections
of
any
sort
will
not
be
recognized,
whether
based
on
religious,
humanistic
or
purely
personal
grounds.
while
the
claims
of
the
categorical
objector
will
be
accepted,
if
based
on
religious,
humanistic
or
deeply
held
conscientious
grounds.
in
this
determination,
religion
and
the
conventional
sense
or
the
absence
of
it,
is
irrelevant.
there
is
no
establishment
of
religion
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
in
a
further
clause
--
i
forgotten
the
exact
formulation
of
it
but
a
personal
moral
code
is
excluded.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
run
into
that
language.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
has
to
do
i
think
with
construing
the
intention
of
congress
with
respect
to
these
matters.
finally,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
many
persons
conscientiously
oppose
many
facets
of
the
law
established
by
the
congress
and
the
state
legislatures.
a
mention
maybe
made
of
abortion,
the
death
penalty,
marijuana,
polygamy,
divorce,
vaccination,
fluoridation
and
birth
control.
these
objections
may
be
most
sincerely
held
and
based
upon
deep
religious
teaching
and
conviction
or
equally
held
conscientious
scruples.
yet
it
is
long
since
established,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
objection
is
religious
or
deeply
held,
does
not
give
the
holder
of
such
views
any
license
to
violate
the
duly
established
law.
religiously
derived
views
do
not
prevail
over
a
national
policy
and
justify
non-compliance
with
the
law.
a
contrary
view
would
extent
to
the
payment
of
taxes
to
compliance
with
laws
for
the
education
of
children
to
health
laws
and
many
other
aspects
of
our
national
life.
indeed,
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
to
proceed
very
far
down
that
road,
leads
to
a
form
of
anarchy
where
each
person
makes
up
his
own
mind
which
of
the
law
is
established
by
the
democratic
process,
he
feels
he
can
conscientiously
comply
with.
this
is
essentially
inconsistent
with
democratic
government
and
would
undermine
the
integrity
of
the
democratic
process.
in
allowing
exemptions
to
those
opposed
to
war
in
any
form,
congress
has
successfully
charted
a
course
that
preserve
the
autonomy
and
freedom
of
religious
bodies
while
avoiding
any
semblance
of
established
religion
as
this
court
said,
last
term
in
the
welsh
case.
and
finally,
there
is
no
violation
here
of
the
equal
protection
concepts
which
may
be
implicit
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
though
that
amendment
does
not
itself
contain
an
equal
protection
clause
in
haec
verba.
as
i
have
suggested
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
those
who
assert
and
unhonorables
"religious"
opposition
to
killing
in
any
war
and
those
who
scruples
against
a
particular
war
necessarily
depend
upon
or
social
or
political
considerations
of
the
moment.
the
classification
which
congress
has
adopted
is
a
rational
one.
congress
could
of
course
extend
it,
but
this
was
not
recommended
by
the
most
recent
comprehensive
survey
of
the
draft
laws,
the
burke
marshall
commission's
report
as
cited
on
page
34
of
our
brief.
congress
has
in
fact
maintained
a
choice
which
has
been
a
part
of
the
fabric
of
our
law
and
national
practice
for
nearly
200
years.
there
is
no
reason
for
concluding
now,
that
this
choice
violates
any
provision
or
concept
of
our
constitution.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
before
opening
my
argument
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
clarify
two
things
which
came
up
in
the
previous
argument
and
which
are
relevant
here.
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
a
fact
that
there
is
in
the
statute,
a
reference
to
a
purely
personal
moral
code.
i
was
a
little
vague
in
my
answer.
i
now
had
a
chance
to
find
the
statutory
language.
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case,
the
negre
case
on
page
1a
at
the
back,
“and
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
require
any
person
to
be
subject
to
combatant
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
who
by
a
reason
by
religious
training
and
belief
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,”
and
then
comes
this
sentence
which
was
unfortunately
omitted
in
the
printing
of
our
brief,
“as
used
in
this
sub-section,
the
term
religious
training
and
belief
does
not
include
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophical
views
or
a
merely
personal
moral
code.”
it
was
because
the
way
the
statute
has
put
it
as
the
definition
of
religious
training
and
belief
which
we
are
not
questioning
here,
rather
than
as
having
something
to
do
with
that
participation
in
war
in
any
form
that
i
omitted
it
before.
formally,
verbally
that's
the
way
it
is
limited.practically,
it
seems
to
me
to
give
some
indication
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
in
formulating
the
provision
itself
and
then
there
was
a
question
to
me
as
to
whether
congress
had
ever
refused
to
allow
conscientious
objection.
this
is
covered
on
pages
34
to
36
of
the
supplement
to
the
brief
which
we
filed
in
the
welsh
case
which
we
printed
the
brief
in
the
seeger
case
which
gave
a
detailed
treatment
of
the
history.
the
fact
is
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war,
military
service
was
a
state
matter
and
you
will
remember,
it
was
always
the
7th
massachusetts
in
the
23rd
ohio
and
so
on.
thereafter,
congress
said
and
some
states
had
conscientious
objector
provisions
and
others
had
different
ones,
thereafter
congress
provided
for
a
draft,
but
at
the
beginning
it
provided
that
you
could
provide
substitutes
and
a
great
many
of
the
conscientious
objectors
apparently
provided
substitutes.
finally,
thereafter,
during
the
civil
war,
congress
enacted
the
statute
which
was
typical
of
the
form
right
down
through
the
world
war
ii,
“that
members
of
religious
denominations
who
shall
by
oath
or
affirmation
declare
that
they
are
conscientiously
opposed
to
the
bearing
of
arms
and
who
are
prohibited
from
doing
so
by
the
rules
and
the
articles
of
faith
and
practice
of
said
religious
denominations
shall
when
drafted
into
the
military
service,
be
considered
non-combatants
and
shall
be
assigned
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
duty
in
the
hospitals
or
to
the
care
of
freed
men
or
shall
pay
the
sum
of
$300
to
such
persons
as
the
secretary
of
war
shall
designate
to
receive
it,
to
be
applied
to
the
benefit
of
the
sick
and
wounded
soldiers.
provided
no
person
shall
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
provision
to
this
section,
unless
his
declaration
of
conscientious
scruples
against
bearing
arms
shall
be
supported
by
satisfactory
evidence
that
his
department
has
been
uniformly
consistent
with
such
declaration.”
now
turning
to
this
case,
i
think
though
it
is
someways
more
complicated,
it
presents
essentially
the
same
legal
issue
as
the
preceding
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
within
what
sense
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
political
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
it
is,
and
i
think
it
is
the
essence
of
our
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
the
--
i
hate
to
get
into
what
is
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church.
i
don't
think
it
is
relevant
to
for
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
an
expert
on
it,
but
it
is
insofar
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
just
and
unjust
wars
which
has
a
theological
significance.
however,
the
church
as
i
understand
it
does
not
make
that
choice
for
the
individual,
and
that
choice
i
suggest
is
on
a
different
level,
and
the
determination
of
the
church
between
just
and
unjust
wars,
that
choice
is
a
personal
choice.
and
if
the
individual's
choice
is
a
selective
conscientious
objection,
he
is
not
covered
by
the
statute
anymore
than
is
a
quaker
who
might
make
the
same
choice.
a
quaker
--
the
quaker
religion,
insofar
as
it
is
formalized
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
form,
but
there
are
many
good
quakers
who
have
served
in
wars,
powell
douglas
served
actively
in
world
war
ii,
herbert
hoover
was
commander-in-chief
of
the
army
and
navy
and
if
a
quaker
says,
yes,
i
understand
that's
the
teaching
of
my
church,
but
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
it's
a
selective
matter,
i
will
serve
in
some
wars
and
not
in
other
wars,
then
he
would
not
be
covered
by
this
statute
either.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
precisely,
precisely
our
position.
that
is
what
congress
has
said.
congress
has
said
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
and
the
issue
is
whether
he
is
opposed
to
all
participation
in
all
wars,
and
he
may
evidence
religion
as
a
reason
for
supporting
the
sincerity
of
his
view
that
he
is
opposed
to
all
wars,
but
if
he
asserts
as
mr.
negre
does,
that
he
is
not
opposed
to
all
wars,
but
he
is
opposed
to
this
war
then
he
doesn't
come
within
the
statute
whether
he
is
religiously
motivated
or
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
in
my
mind
that
mr.
negre
is
religiously
motivated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
say,
it
is
in
the
last
analysis
his
choice,
not
his
church's
choice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
it
is
not
a
religious
belief
which
leads
him
to
say
that
i
will
not
participate
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
does
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
does,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
discriminates
between
a
person
who
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
and
one
who
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
this
particular
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
broad
sense
which
is
the
result
of,
i
won't
say,
is
decided
by,
but
is
the
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
welsh
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
i
would
equally
say
that
the
belief
which
asserted
that
i
do
not
believe
in
any
supreme
being,
i
uphold
all
organized
religion,
however,
by
a
reason
of
deep
conscientious
feeling
i
have
concluded
that
i
will
not
participate
in
war
in
any
form,
would
likewise
be
protected.
whether
it
is
religion
in
the
conventional
sense
or
not,
makes
no
difference.
the
question
is
that
the
depth
of
the
view
and
the
nature
of
the
view.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
one
is
a
view
which
within
the
statutory
language
as
it
has
come
to
be
meant
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief,
is
opposed
to
war
in
any
--
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
the
other
is
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief,
however,
it's
construed,
is
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
we
are
discriminating
between
one
religious
belief
and
another,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
are
discriminating
between
one
belief
which
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
whether
it
is
supported
by
conventional
religion
or
not,
and
on
the
other
hand
a
--
an
opposition
to
participation
in
this
particular
war
whether
it
is
supported
by
conventional
religion
or
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that's
what
i
have
been
trying
to
say
whether
it
is
religious
or
not,
if
it
selective,
it
(a)
doesn't
come
within
the
statute,
and
(b)
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
congress
to
recognize
it
or
putting
it
another
way,
it
does
not
amount
to
an
establishment
of
religion
or
a
denial
of
the
free
exercise
of
a
religion
which
is
all
that
the
first
amendment
covers,
nor
is
it
invidious
discrimination,
insofar
as
there
is
an
equal
protection
concept
in
the
fifth
amendment.
now
it's
already
been
pointed
out
that
this
case
is
different
from
gillette
case
since
it
arises
in
habeas
corpus
and
is
not
a
criminal
case,
this
i
don't
think
makes
any
significant
difference.
it
is
based
on
a
directive
of
the
department
of
defense
and
army
regulations
which
provide
for
release
of
people
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
objection,
and
they
shall
be
judged
according
to
the
regulation
by
the
same
standards,
whether
made
before
or
after
entering
military
service,
and
that
these
shall
be
the
selective
service
system
standards.
thus
section
6
(j)
is
incorporated
into
the
relevant
military
regulations.
i
do
think
it
is
pertinent
to
point
out
again,
as
has
been
asserted,
as
has
been
stated
here
by
mr.
harrington
that
the
petitioner
is
no
longer
on
active
duty
in
the
army.
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
ready
reserve.
he
can
quite
readily
within
the
conscientious
scruples
which
he
showed
during
the
four
months
that
he
was
in
the
army,
where
he
was
willing
to
serve
in
uniform
on
this
side.
he
can
quite
readily
comply
with
the
military
requirement,
which
seem
to
me
that
if
he
doesn't,
it
is
simply
a
clear
case
of
military
disobedience
which
ought
to
be
treated
as
such.
if
he
does
feel
that
his
views
have
now
changed,
so
that
he
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
any
form,
he
is
still
entitled
to
file
a
claim
based
upon
that.
i
do
not
understand
that
he
has
ever
made
any
such
claim.
now,
the
other
difference
between
this
case
and
the
gillette
case
as
already
pointed
out,
is
that
the
objection
in
the
present
case
has
a
clear
religious
basis
within
the
conventional
sense
of
that
term.
now
the
petitioner
is
a
catholic.
he
based
his
application
on
well
known
writings
of
traditional
catholic
authors,
including
the
present
pope
and
his
predecessor
pope
john
xxiii.
and
on
the
basis
of
these
writings
he
says,
that
each
catholic
must
form
his
own
conscience
in
respect
of
military
service,
and
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
just
and
unjust
wars.
on
this
basis,
he
concludes
that
he
cannot
conscientiously
participate
in
the
war
in
vietnam,
although
he
would
be
prepared
to
perform
noncombatant
hospital
service
in
the
united
states,
because
such
service
is
not
directly
in
aid
of
the
army
in
vietnam.
the
hearing
officer
found
that
he
was
a
devout
catholic,
who
sincerely
believed
that
the
war
in
vietnam
was
wrong.
he
concluded,
however,
that
the
application
for
discharge
should
be
rejected
because
in
his
opinion,
the
applicant
objected
to
a
particular
war
and
not
to
war
in
any
form,
and
this
was
supported
by
the
department
of
the
army.
the
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
pages
47
and
48
of
the
appendix,
read
the
or
recited
the
opinion
of
the
hearing
officer
and
concluded
that
it
is
a
fact
when
considered
together
with
other
facts
disclosed
in
the
record,
including
the
timing
of
the
application
and
petitioner's
request
for
noncombatant
status,
with
the
restriction
that
he
be
assigned
to
duties
in
the
united
states
that
these
could
sustain
the
opinion
of
the
hearing
officer
and
the
decision
of
the
army.
it
therefore
cannot
be
said
that
the
decision
of
the
army
is
without
a
basis,
in
fact,
they
are.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
on
page
51
of
the
appendix,
that
beyond
question
there
was
a
basis
in
fact,
for
the
conclusions
of
the
department
of
the
army.
it
further
pointed
out,
that
the
petitioner
objects
to
the
war
in
vietnam,
not
to
all
wars
and
clearly
his
views
are
completely
inconsistent
with
objection
to
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
i
know
of
no
such
figures.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not.
of
course,
we
have
two
groups.
we
have
those
before
the
selective
service
system,
which
would
follow
one
procedure.
we
have
those
seeking
release
from
the
army
which
would
follow
another
procedure.
those
come
in
at
least
four
or
may
be
five
different
services
and
i
do
not
know
if
any
effort
to
tabulate
the
expressly
selective
claims
which
have
been
made
since
judge
wyzanski's
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
share
that
feeling
to
a
very
considerable
extent.
this
man
is
in
the
ready
reserve.
there's
a
suggestion
here
by
mr.
harrington
not
supported
in
the
record,
i
mean
i
am
not
denying
it,
i
just
don't
know
it,
that
he
isn't
attending
his
drills
and
may
be
subject
to
an
order
of
call
up.
as
i
have
said
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
pure
case
of
military
disobedience.
he
has
never
made
a
claim
of
total
conscientious
objection.
this
is
never
been
passed
on
by
anyone.
his
claim
is
one
of
the
selective
conscientious
objection
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
effect
of
the
department
--
army
was
that
he
wouldn't
be
classified
as
1-ao,
that
is
as
a
noncombatant
in
the
military
services,
which
was
the
service
which
he
did
perform.
frankly,
i
don't
myself
understand
why
the
case
isn't
moot,
but
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
case
is
cited
in
the
footnotes,
have
had
a
chilling
effect
on
me
and
i
didn't
quite
feel
that
i
could
assert
that
the
case
was
moot
or
let
me
put
it
in
other
way,
if
i
had
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot,
i
would
have
thought
that
maybe
i
would
not
have
been
successful.
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
it
would
not
–
[laughter]
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
not
distress
me
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
case
was
moot.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
case,
where
the
court
is
being
called
on
to
decide
the
ultimate
question
of
principle
in
a
factual
situation
where
it
is
not
really
presented.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
he
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
he
is
trying
very
hard
to
get
a
decision
out
of
this
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
he
is
apparently
now,
not
complying
with
his
reserve
obligation,
in
order
that
he
maybe
called
back
into
active
service,
in
order
that
he
may
get
another
order
to
go
to
vietnam,
in
order
that
he
maybe
sure
that
the
issue
will
be
presented.
whether
that
possibility
which
turns
considerably
on
his
own
determination
to
get
a
decision
on
this
issue
is
sufficient
to
keep
the
case
from
being
moot,
is
something
which
the
court
ought
to
consider,
will
consider
of
course,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
much
reason
to
think
that
this
is
a
case
which
is
essentially
moot.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
still
have
--
not,
we
don't
have
the
catholic
doctrine
argument
in
the
other
case,
we
have
the
selective
conscientious.
but
i
think
the
catholic
doctrine
argument
can
be
highlighted
by
the
reply
brief
which
was
filed
in
this
case.
incidentally
it
is
full
of
learned
excerpts
from
catholic
authors
through
the
years,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
how
far
the
court
can
properly
take
judicial
notice
of
such
material.
if
it
is
relevant,
which
i
don't
think
it
is,
because
i
don't
think
the
court
can
go
into
church
doctrine
of
any
kind,
if
it
is
relevant,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
to
be
put
in
by
evidence,
it
ought
to
be
subject
to
examination
and
cross-examination,
and
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
to
put
in
other
teachings
of
other
prominent
catholic
theologians.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
very
confusing
mass
of
material
all
together
can
be
found
rather
than
the
selected
materials
which
are
here.
but
the
point
to
which
i
want
to
make
is
-–
can
be
seen
in
two
page
places
in
this
brief.
page
3,
the
heading,
this
is
the
blue
covered
reply
brief
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
its
members
have
a
religious
duty
to
participate
in
just
wars.
now,
if
there
were
that,
if
that
were
true,
there
would
be
a
problem.
among
other
things
they
couldn't
ever
be
a
catholic
conscientious
objector
within
the
statute.
he
would
always
say,
well,
i
will
participate
in
just
war,
and
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
mulloy
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
last
year,
involved
a
catholic
and
had
substantial
material
and
the
record
about
catholic
doctrine
and
he
claimed
to
be
a
total
conscientious
objector.
now,
we
have
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
another
case
which
is
now
pending,
raising
an
issue
like
this,
laird
against
capobianco,
number
611
which
also
involves
a
catholic
who
claims
to
be
a
total
conscientious
objector
and
i
think
that
the
light
comes
on
page
7
of
the
reply
brief.
this
is
a
place
where
there
was
an
error
in
the
printing
of
the
brief
and
the
material
has
in
my
copy
at
least
and
i
hope
in
yours
has
been
written
in
long
hand.
this
is
the
language
--
yes,
i
have
it
--
this
is
the
language
just
below
the
middle
of
page
7,
captain
vanvert
(ph)
right
at
the
middle
of
page
7,
captain
vanvert
(ph)
was
correct
in
capturing
the
theological
gist
of
the
teaching
of
paul
vi,
in
the
pastoral
constitution,
that
a
catholic
has
a
religious
duty
to
distinguish
between
just
wars
in
which
he
may
participate,
and
unjust
wars
in
which
he
has
a
religious
duty
to
refuse
to
participate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
am
sorry,
in
the
one
that
i
have,
it
says,
distinguish
and
the
one
that
mr.
harrington
has,
it
says,
discriminate
and
i
don't
know
whether
they
couldn't
make
up
their
mind
or
whether
[laughter]
whether
it
was
an
error.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
which
he
may
participate,
i
believe
that
is
an
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
i
am
sorry,
mr.
harrington's
copy.
this
is
interesting
because
apparently
there
was
a
change
in
view
as
they
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
the
copy
that
was
furnished
to
me
has
the
language
on
which
i
have
based
my
argument
and
which
i
will
stand
on
to
distinguish
between
just
wars
in
which
he
may
participate
and
unjust
wars
in
which
he
has
a
religious
duty
to
refuse
to
participate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
venture
the
suggestion
that
the
sound
theological
doctrine
is
that
a
catholic
may
participate
in
all
wars,
that
in
part
catholic
may
decline
to
participate
in
all
wars
and
that
he
is
not
under
a
religious
duty
to
participate
in
just
wars.
that
he
does
have
a
considerable
freedom
of
conscience
and
i
haven't
the
slightest
doubt
that
that
is
the
practical
construction
which
has
been
given
not
only
by
many
individual
catholics,
but
by
their
religious
advisors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
depends
upon
what
the
decision
in
the
welsh
case
means
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
five
members
of
the
court
on
one
ground
or
another
have
determined
that
the
word
religious
training
and
belief
in
the
statute
do
not
have
much
significance.
four
because
they
don't
think
they
should
have
and
one
because
he
thinks
that
constitutionally,
they
can't
have
and
all
that
we
on
this
side
of
the
bar
can
do
is
to
undertake
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
which
was
reached
for
varying
reasons
by
five
members
of
the
court,
which
did
in
effect
ride
out
from
the
statute,
the
word
religious
training
and
belief.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
have
no
more
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
i
believe
presents
again
the
problem
which
was
not
decided
last
term
in
unites
states
against
sisson
and
welsh.
the
question
which
maybe
summarized
is
that
of
the
selective
conscientious
objector;
the
objector
to
a
particular
war
who
does
not
claim
to
be
fundamentally
opposed
to
all
war.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
no
contention
that
his
beliefs
here
are
not
religiously
based
as
that
word
was
adumbrated
in
the
welsh
case.
and
i
believe
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
adumbrated
means
stated
in
the
cloudy
fashion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
why
i
said
adumbrated
in
the
welsh
case.
four
members
of
the
court
construed
the
words
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
four
other
members
of
the
court
disagreed
with
that
but
one
of
them
held
that
the
--
in
order
to
maintain
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
it
must
be
treated
as
if
they
weren't
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
whatever
the
effect
of
it
is,
we
make
no
contention
that
this
is
not
religiously
based
within
the
meaning
of
the
seeger
case
and
i
say
the
welsh
case,
whatever
it
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
course,
i
do
not
seek
to
resolve
that
difference
except
that
the
consequence
was
that
in
one
case,
in
the
case
of
four
justices
on
ground
to
statutory
construction
and
in
the
case
of
a
fifth
judge
on
what
i
think,
must
be
said
to
be
statutory
construction
compelled
by
the
constitution,
the
result
was
reached
that
the
effect
of
religious
training
and
belief
in
the
statute
shall
i
say,
qualify.
at
any
rate
as
so
qualified,
we
raise
no
contention
that
it
was
not
religiously
based
here.
the
question
arises
here
because
of
the
finding
of
the
district
court
and
this
appears
on
page
13
of
the
appendix.
no,
i
made
a
claim
that
i
think
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
board
concluding
that
whatever
moral
views
were
held,
they
were
directed
to
the
vietnam
war.
now
this
case
was
tried
before
judge
wyatt
with
a
jury.
it
lead
to
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
only
issue
which
judge
wyatt
submitted
to
the
jury
was
the
question
whether
he
willfully
failed
to
comply
within
order
to
report
for
induction
and
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
before
this
court,
was
whether
judge
wyatt
made
any
errors
of
law
in
connection
with
the
conduct
of
the
trial,
leading
up
to
that
submission
to
the
jury.
and
the
only
error
of
law
which
is
suggested
relates
to
this
question
of
selective
conscientious
objection
which
is
embodied
in
that
ruling
of
judge
wyatt
which
appears
on
page
13
of
the
record.
similarly,
the
court
of
appeals
treated
it
on
the
same
basis.
at
page
20
of
the
appendix,
the
second
paragraph
on
the
page,
the
court
of
appeal
says
evidence
derived
from
gillette's
selective
service
file
and
from
his
testimony,
before
judge
wyatt,
reveals
that
gillette's
beliefs
were
based
on
humanism
and
that's
within
the
welsh
case,
and
were
specifically
directed
against
the
war
in
vietnam
which
raises
the
selective
conscientious
objection
issue.
the
statutory
provision
involved
here
seems
to
be
rather
clear.
it
is
section
6
(j)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967,
which
grants
exemption
from
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
to
any
person
found
by
his
local
board
to
be
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief,
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
all
of
the
applicable
factors,
the
statutory
construction
point
to
the
conclusion
that
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
or
construction,
this
passage
of
the
statute,
particularly
the
last
three
words,
should
be
construed
to
mean
what
it
seems
to
say.
i
suggest
that
this
conclusion
is
supported
on
at
least
five
grounds.
one,
the
language
of
the
statute
in
any
form.
two
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it
really
makes
much
difference,
but
i
do
think
it
is
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
where
it
lies
in
the
statute.
it
doesn't
say
participation
in
any
form
in
war.
i
don't
think
it
would
make
much
difference
if
it
did.
if
you
can't
participate
in
any
form
in
war,
you
are
totally
conscientious
objecting,
if
you
can't
participate
in
war
in
any
form,
you
are
totally
conscientious
objecting.
and
second,
the
long
history
of
provisions
of
this
sort
and
third;
the
more
immediate
legislative
history,
fourth;
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
and
fifth;
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
respected
courts
and
judges.
and
first,
the
language
of
the
statute;
as
i
have
indicated
it
says
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
the
words
are
simple
and
sweeping,
in
any
form.
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
legislative
intent
could
have
been
more
clearly
put.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
in
the
light
of
all
the
setting
as
just
what
congress
really
meant.
the
very
shortness
and
simplicity
of
the
language
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
it
means
what
it
says.
there
is
no
ambiguity
here
as
such
as
the
court
found
in
the
words
religious
training
and
belief
or
at
least
some
members
of
the
court
found
in
the
words
religious
training
and
belief
involved
in
the
welsh
case
and
next,
we
have
the
history
of
provision
to
this
sort.
they
go
back
at
least
to
1775
when
the
continental
congress
adopted
a
resolution
to
honor
the
conscientious
of
those
who
"from
religious
principles
cannot
bear
arms
in
any
case"
and
all
of
our
early
legislation
on
conscientious
objection
was
in
terms
of
members
of
the
historic
peace
churches,
the
quakers,
the
mennonites
and
others.
all
of
whom
were
opposed
to
war
in
any
circumstances.
in
our
modern
view,
the
exemption
cannot
be
limited
to
members
of
particular
churches.
it
must
be
extended
to
all
those
whose
views
are
"religious"
in
a
broad
and
deeply
held
sense,
including
humanism.
but
this
is
no
reason
for
changing
the
scope
of
the
exemption
which
has
always
involved
opposition
to
war
"in
any
form."
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
that
history
is
outlined
in
detail
and
the
appendix
to
the
seeger
brief
filed
five
years
ago.
i
read
that
through
in
connection
with
the
welsh
case.
i
don't
recall
that
there
has
ever
been
a
period
when
the
conscientious
objection
was
completely
denied.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
have
no
doubt
myself
that
congress
could
do
so
and
you
and
the
court
generation
ago
said
so,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
decision
on
that
point.
next,
i
turn
to
the
more
immediate
legislative
history.
at
the
time
of
world
war
i,
senator
la
follette
proposed
an
amendment
which
would
have
granted
exemption
on
the
ground
of
a
conscientious
objection
to
the
undertaking
of
combatant
service
in
the
present
war
and
this
was
rejected
by
the
senate
and
no
changes
have
since
been
made
in
the
statute.
it
continues
to
be
applicable
to
those
who
are
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
then
there
are
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
as
congress
saw
when
senator
la
follette's
amendment
was
proposed
in
1917,
there
is
a
great
practical
difference,
a
difference
in
kind
between
opposition
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
opposition
to
a
particular
war.
how
particular
must
the
war
be?
in
world
war
ii,
could
a
person
have
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
the
war
in
europe
and
africa,
but
not
opposed
to
the
war
in
the
pacific
on
the
ground
that
the
japanese
had
attacked
us,
but
we
hadn't
been
attacked
in
europe
and
africa.
or
could
he
on
sincere
religious
grounds
have
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
air
war
because
it
affected
civilians,
but
was
not
to
opposed
to
ground
war.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
could
he
successfully,
could
he
have
come
within
the
language
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
can
it
be
practically
determined
how
sincere
he
is,
whether
he
really
is
sincere,
particularly,
when
the
external
earmark
of
conventional
religion
has
been
taken
away
from
the
test.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no,
there
is
no
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
but
i
am
talking
about
the
question
of
construing
this
statute
as
to
whether
the
words
in
any
form
mean,
shall
i
say
in
any
form.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
if
they
are
construed
to
mean
some
thing
other
than
that,
that
the
practical
questions
which
will
be
raised
in
other
cases,
not
in
this
case
but
in
other
cases,
will
be
very
serious.
congress
is
expressly
given
power
by
the
constitution
to
raise
and
support
armies
but
how
is
it
possible
to
do
this
as
a
practical
matter.
if
each
man
must
be
asked,
each
time
he
is
ordered
to
a
specific
duty,
whether
he
is
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
this
particular
segment
of
war
and
i
don't
say
of
the
war,
i
say,
of
war.
in
this
connection,
it
maybe
pointed
out
that
it
is
not
possible
to
know
now,
whether
either
the
petitioner
here
or
the
petitioner
in
the
next
case
would
ever
be
sent
to
vietnam,
if
he
should
see
service
in
the
army.
not
all
drafted
men
by
any
means
are
sent
to
vietnam.
the
country
has
many
other
responsibilities
throughout
the
world
,
which
require
the
maintenance
of
large
units
of
the
armed
forces
in
many
places,
in
germany
and
elsewhere
in
europe,
in
korea,
in
the
philippines,
in
hawaii
and
many
other
bases
in
this
country
and
in
the
arctic
and
in
the
mediterranean.
it
is
hard
to
see
on
what
basis
the
petitioners
can
claim
exemption
from
combatant
or
non-combatant
training,
when
they
would
conscientiously
accept
some
combatant
or
non-combatant
service.
and
finally,
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
which
construe
the
statutory
language
the
way
it
reads.
perhaps,
the
best
known
of
these
is
that
by
the
great
judge
augustus
hand
in
his
opinion
in
united
states
against
kauten,
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
where
he
said
that
a
belief
is
sufficient
to
qualify
for
a
conscientious
objector
status
must
be
a
general
scruple
is
"against
participation
in
war
in
any
form,"
and
not
merely
an
objection
to
participation
in
the
particular
war.
now,
this
interpretation
has
been
followed
in
a
number
of
cases,
also
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
including
the
two
cases,
the
two
courts
below
in
the
cases
now
before
the
court.
there
is
also
the
well
known
passage
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
concurred
in
by
justices
stone
and
brandeis
in
hamilton
against
regents,
and
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
quoting
with
the
approval
from
united
states
against
macintosh.
and
this
seems
to
have
been
the
unanimous
view
of
the
court
in
the
welsh
case,
as
we
have
indicated
by
references
to
the
three
opinions
in
that
case
on
page
19
of
our
brief.
and
since
the
proper
construction
of
the
statued,
shows
that
congress
has
determined
to
limit
the
exemption.
the
remaining
question
before
the
court
is,
whether
this
legislative
judgment
runs
afoul
of
some
constitutional
command.
now,
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
turning
to
the
constitutional
argument,
we
note
first,
that
the
constitution
in
simple
but
broad
and
unqualified
terms
gives
the
congress
power
to
raise
and
support
armies.
this
has
been
then
broadly
construed
by
this
court,
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases
and
more
recently
in
united
states
against
o'brien.
the
chief
ground
for
limitation
suggested
here,
is
that
of
religious
freedom
under
the
first
amendment.
this
court
has
declared
that
congress
need
grant
no
exemption
to
conscientious
objectives
at
all
in
hamilton
against
regents,
and
united
states
against
macintosh.
i
am
glad
that
congress
does
provide
an
exemption
for
conscientious
objectors.
indeed
my
principal
concern
about
this
case,
is
that
if
the
exemption
is
pushed
to
unintended
and
impractical
lengths
it
may
jeopardize
the
whole
concept
of
the
exemption,
which
has
in
fact
worked
rather
remarkably
well
over
a
period
of
close
to
200
years.
when
there
was,
as
there
was
for
a
long
time,
an
essentially
religious
meaning
to
the
phrase
religious
training
and
belief,
then
there
was
an
external
standard
which
could
be
used
with
some
objectivity
in
determining
the
sincerity
of
the
claim.
now,
that
is
largely
gone.
if
selective
conscientious
objection
has
to
be
recognized,
the
external
standards
almost
completely
disappear.
it
then
becomes
almost
entirely
a
matter
of
personal
preference
or
choice.
many
personal
choices
are
passionately
held,
sincerely
and
conscientiously
maintained.
indeed,
one
of
the
comments
often
made
about
youth
is
that
they
readily
convert
any
matter
of
choice
or
preference
into
a
matter
of
sincerity
or
conscientious.
one
of
the
problems
about
a
conscientious
objector
system
is
to
administer
it
fairly,
fairly
to
those
who
go
as
well
as
to
those
who
are
allowed
to
engage
in
alternative
service.
it
needs
to
be
remembered
that
for
every
conscientious
objector,
for
every
conscientious
objector
there
is
a
man
called
to
serve
who
would
not
otherwise
be
called.
he
isn't
here,
he
isn't
before
us
but
in
every
case,
it
is
a
choice
between
this
man
and
some
other
man.
if
it
becomes
impossible
to
administer
the
system
fairly,
then
congress
may
conclude
that
it
should
be
terminated.
many
would
agree
i
think
that,
that
would
be
unfortunate.
in
the
terms
of
the
first
amendment,
there
are
two
aspects,
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause.
both
the
history
and
the
practice
with
respect
to
conscientious
objector
provisions
show
that
congress
was
seeking
to
accommodate
rather
than
to
establish
religion.
this
is
indeed
the
effect
of
the
welsh
case.
to
make
it
clear
that
no
form
of
religion
or
non-religion,
as
long
as
it
is
deeply
held,
is
given
special
treatment.
no
religion
is
favored,
none
is
discriminated
against,
and
none
as
established.
in
excluding
selective
objectors,
there
is
no
religious
preference,
no
religious
discrimination.
no
one
is
called
because
he
holds
a
particular
religion,
no
one
is
exempted
because
he
holds
a
particular
religion.
what
the
statute
does,
is
to
recognize
a
qualitative
difference
between
general
and
selective
objection
without
regard
to
religion.
if
the
claim
is
deeply
and
sincerely
held,
selective
conscientious
objection
necessarily
involves
a
form
of
political
judgment.
a
conclusion
in
opposition
to
the
policy
reached
by
the
duly
elected
government,
with
respect
to
a
particular
area
at
a
certain
time,
under
stated
conditions.
though
the
response
may
be
religiously
or
conscientiously
motivated,
it
rests
in
the
first
instance
on
a
decision
that
is
particular
and
political.
in
contrast,
those
who
conscientiously
oppose
participation
in
combat
in
any
form
do
not
invoke
the
same
type
of
contemporary
political
judgment.
there
objection
is
to
war,
all
the
war,
independent
of
place,
time
or
circumstance.
we
have
here
a
particular
form
of
selective
objection,
but
there
could
be
others.
objections
to
particular
weapons
or
to
the
political
make
up
of
our
allies
in
any
war
or
to
combat
on
sunday
or
on
saturday.
congress
does
not
establish
or
disestablish
any
religion
when
it
says
that
such
matters
need
not
be
gone
into,
that
selective
conscientious
objections
of
any
sort
will
not
be
recognized,
whether
based
on
religious,
humanistic
or
purely
personal
grounds.
while
the
claims
of
the
categorical
objector
will
be
accepted,
if
based
on
religious,
humanistic
or
deeply
held
conscientious
grounds.
in
this
determination,
religion
and
the
conventional
sense
or
the
absence
of
it,
is
irrelevant.
there
is
no
establishment
of
religion
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
in
a
further
clause
--
i
forgotten
the
exact
formulation
of
it
but
a
personal
moral
code
is
excluded.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
you
run
into
that
language.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
has
to
do
i
think
with
construing
the
intention
of
congress
with
respect
to
these
matters.
finally,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause.
many
persons
conscientiously
oppose
many
facets
of
the
law
established
by
the
congress
and
the
state
legislatures.
a
mention
maybe
made
of
abortion,
the
death
penalty,
marijuana,
polygamy,
divorce,
vaccination,
fluoridation
and
birth
control.
these
objections
may
be
most
sincerely
held
and
based
upon
deep
religious
teaching
and
conviction
or
equally
held
conscientious
scruples.
yet
it
is
long
since
established,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
objection
is
religious
or
deeply
held,
does
not
give
the
holder
of
such
views
any
license
to
violate
the
duly
established
law.
religiously
derived
views
do
not
prevail
over
a
national
policy
and
justify
non-compliance
with
the
law.
a
contrary
view
would
extent
to
the
payment
of
taxes
to
compliance
with
laws
for
the
education
of
children
to
health
laws
and
many
other
aspects
of
our
national
life.
indeed,
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
to
proceed
very
far
down
that
road,
leads
to
a
form
of
anarchy
where
each
person
makes
up
his
own
mind
which
of
the
law
is
established
by
the
democratic
process,
he
feels
he
can
conscientiously
comply
with.
this
is
essentially
inconsistent
with
democratic
government
and
would
undermine
the
integrity
of
the
democratic
process.
in
allowing
exemptions
to
those
opposed
to
war
in
any
form,
congress
has
successfully
charted
a
course
that
preserve
the
autonomy
and
freedom
of
religious
bodies
while
avoiding
any
semblance
of
established
religion
as
this
court
said,
last
term
in
the
welsh
case.
and
finally,
there
is
no
violation
here
of
the
equal
protection
concepts
which
may
be
implicit
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
though
that
amendment
does
not
itself
contain
an
equal
protection
clause
in
haec
verba.
as
i
have
suggested
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
those
who
assert
and
unhonorables
"religious"
opposition
to
killing
in
any
war
and
those
who
scruples
against
a
particular
war
necessarily
depend
upon
or
social
or
political
considerations
of
the
moment.
the
classification
which
congress
has
adopted
is
a
rational
one.
congress
could
of
course
extend
it,
but
this
was
not
recommended
by
the
most
recent
comprehensive
survey
of
the
draft
laws,
the
burke
marshall
commission's
report
as
cited
on
page
34
of
our
brief.
congress
has
in
fact
maintained
a
choice
which
has
been
a
part
of
the
fabric
of
our
law
and
national
practice
for
nearly
200
years.
there
is
no
reason
for
concluding
now,
that
this
choice
violates
any
provision
or
concept
of
our
constitution.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
