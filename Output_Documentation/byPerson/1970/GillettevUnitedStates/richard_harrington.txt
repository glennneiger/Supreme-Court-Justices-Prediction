mr.
richard
harrington
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
louis
negre.
louis
negre
is
a
young
man
who
is
a
catholic
conscientious
objector.
he
sought
discharge
from
the
united
states
armed
forces
when
he
was
assigned
to
serve
in
vietnam.
and
his
application
for
conscientious
objection
discharge
having
been
denied
by
the
army
on
the
grounds
that
was
based
on
personal
moral
code.
he
was
assigned
to
go
to
vietnam.
so,
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
the
war
in
which
he
was
asked
to
serve
was
the
war
to
which
he
objects.
he
had
standing
to
object
to
serving
in
that
particular
war,
to
which
he
was
assigned.
he
sought
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
judge
zirpoli
in
san
francisco,
to
restrain
the
army
from
shipping
him
to
vietnam
to
take
part
in
that
war
and
to
be
discharged
as
a
religious
objector.
judge
zirpoli
denied
his
application
for
habeas
corpus
on
grounds
set
out
in
his
opinion
and
in
the
course
of
argument,
he
made
the
observation,
“that
even
if
my
client
mr.
negre
were
willing
to
serve
in
united
states,
but
under
the
common
law
concept,
he
would
be
aiding
and
abetting
the
war.”
my
client
relied
however,
on
the
concept
that
was
traditional
in
the
law
and
also
in
logic
between
approximate
and
remote
participation.
he
indicated
that
he'll
do
a
practical
distinction
that
he
would
not
participate
in
any
form
in
the
war,
but
like
the
man
in
kansas
who
was
against
world
war
ii,
and
he
was
a
railroad
switchman,
he
did
not
decline
to
flip
the
switches
when
the
railroad
troop
trains
came
through
and
that
was
charged
against
him
that
he
was
willing
to
participate
in
war.
of
course,
it
would
be
nonsense
to
say
that
a
man
has
to
close
his
eyes
when
the
troop
train
goes
by
or
else
he
is
participating
in
war.
there
is
a
distinction
between
non-participation
and
participation.
my
client
refused
to
participate
and
refused
to
participate
in
vietnam.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
made
his
first
claim,
your
honor,
approximately
four
months
after
induction
into
the
service
and
after
he
had
been
assigned
to
serve
in
vietnam.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think
the
latter,
your
honor.
he
was
a
roman
catholic
and
as
i
have
been
at
pains
to
set
out
in
my
briefs
and
as
it's
set
out
by
the
army
hearing
officer
--
mr.
richard
harrington
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor,
the
army's
answer
to
that
in
judge
zirpoli's
court
was
they
had
no
provision
for
canceling
his
assignment
to
vietnam.
on
the
pragmatic
side,
the
army
puts
the
practicalities
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
does.
it
says,
we
don't
have
any
form
of
duty,
where
a
man
can
say,
i'll
serve
here,
but
i
won't
serve
there.
they
said
--
mr.
richard
harrington
his
position
was
taken
only
because
the
army
said
it
had
no
assignment
for
him
except
to
compel
him
to
participate
in
the
war
in
vietnam
and
that's
where
indeed
they
carried
him.
they
assigned
four
sergeants,
put
them
on
an
airplane
and
carried
him
to
vietnam,
after
this
court
refused
to
entertain
stay.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
has
four
year
army
reserve
obligation
and
i
presume
the
next
time
your
honor
that
they
want
him
to
serve,
they
will
pick
them
up
again
and
take
him
again,
as
they
have
done
on
the
prior
occasion.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
was
acquitted
because
the
army
didn't
follow
its
own
procedures
in
processing
his
application.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
filed
the
first
application
which
was
summary,
because
hastily
prepared,
that
was
denied.
he
filed
a
second
application
supported
with
citation
of
religious
authority
and
letters
from
friends.
the
army
said
that's
just
the
same,
but
the
army
could
not
persuade
the
court-martial
it
was
just
the
same.
the
seven
combat
veterans
on
the
court-martial
said
that's
entirely
different,
please
process
the
second
application.
the
second
application
was
then
denied.
he
again
declined
to
go
to
vietnam.
i
suggest
that
that
court-martial
him,
he
was
ready
to
stay
in
court-martial,
but
they
carried
him
off
instead.
mr.
richard
harrington
four
months.
mr.
richard
harrington
came
home.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
not
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
he
did.
mr.
richard
harrington
now
in
the
ready
reserve,
with
a
four-year
obligation,
to
be
called
on
the
order
of
president
or
for
failing
to
meet
his
ready
reserve
obligations
at
any
time.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
there
is
--
the
solicitor
general
takes
the
view
that
that
puts
them
in
the
realm
of
politics,
but
if
you
look
at
the
catholic
religion
--
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
hasn't
addressed
himself
to
it,
but
i
can
answer
that,
as
follows.
aquinas
and
his
treaties,
part
ll,
section
2,
question
40,
put
that
very
question
and
he
said,
the
question
is
that
it
is
always
simple
to
participate
in
war,
his
answer
was
no,
that
was
1272,
teachings
of
aquinas
by
canon
1366
of
canon
law
with
the
roman
catholic
church
is
binding,
teaching
in
all
catholics.
and
that
doctrine
was
reaffirmed
not
only
by
aquinas,
but
i
just
counted
them
in
the
brief
by
st.
augustine,
by
victoria
salamanca
1520,
(inaudible)
1787.
the
baltimore
catechism
1949,
vatican
ii
1965
and
the
american
bishops.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think,
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct.
whatever
the
differences
of
the
court
were
--
mr.
richard
harrington
it's
based
on
based
on
older
religion,
and
i
am
astonished
at
the
suggestion
by
the
government
that
is
not
a
religious
belief
because
--
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
not
only
leaves
it,
it
mandates
the
individual,
who
exercises
conscience,
because
it's
the
individual
who
is
judged.
as
mr.
negre
pointed
out
in
his
application,
the
church
isn't
judged
--
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
the
church
has
specific
definition
of
objector
to
consider
--
mr.
richard
harrington
the
church
does
not
take
any
possession
on
any
factual
--
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
it's
call
examination
or
formation
of
conscious
and
you
have
a
duty
to
properly
form
your
conscious.
again,
as
aquinas
points
out,
you
commit
a
mistake
which
is
objectively
a
mistake,
you
are
not
guilty
of
moral
fault
for
the
mistake,
but
you
maybe
guilty
of
moral
fault
if
you
haven't
properly
formed
your
conscious
by
careful
study,
inquiry,
prayer
and
investigation,
as
far
as,
you
may
enter
the
matter.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
it
says,
the
fact
is,
starting
from
aquinas
as
i
say
in
1272,
they
are
often
broken
down
into
lists,
whether
the
war
was
declared
by
the
properly
constituted
government
is
one
factor.
whether
it's
conducted
in
defense
as
opposed
to
a
war
of
aggression
is
another
factor.
whether
the
means
used
are
proper
means
and
do
not
injure
civilian
populations,
who
are
not
combatants
is
the
third
factor.
accordingly,
there
are
factors
which
have
different
numbers
on
different
lists,
but
they
go
to
the
justice
of
the
war
in
broad
sense.
now,
one
of
the
tests
is
whether
the
harm
done
exceeds
the
gain
that
maybe
expected
from
the
war,
in
other
words,
and
this
(inaudible).
mr.
richard
harrington
always
--
mr.
richard
harrington
always
and
that's
also
true
of
the
quaker.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
i
think
the
function
that
was
outlined
correctly
in
the
seeger
opinion
that
what
the
government,
draft
warrant
or
hearing
officer
has
to
do
is
to
determine
are
the
beliefs
religious
and
are
they
second,
sincerely
held.
once
they
are
found
to
be
religious
and
sincerely
held,
its
no
part
of
government
to
put
on
its
theological
half
and
say,
well,
my
friend
you
say
its
religious
and
you
have
supporting
letters
that
it's
religious,
but
we
have
the
government
theologian
sitting
here
and
he
wants
to
engage
in
a
theological
inquisition,
whether
you
are
an
orthodox
catholic?
did
you
go
to
church
four
times
last
month?
have
you
take
confession?
that's
no
part
of
government.
what
is
the
government's
function
as
announced
in
seeger
is
to
determine
why
is
the
belief
religious,
however
that
doctrine
maybe
interpreted.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think,
the
solicitor
general
contends
that
my
client's
objection
is
political.
his
brief
says
that
despite
the
fact
he
is
resting
it
upon
teaching
of
the
roman
catholic
church
which
has
been
uniform
for
2000
years
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
army
hearing
officer,
in
his
findings
set
out
at
appendix
837
said
the
following.
“his
religious
training
has
been
extensive
and
he
was
extremely
devout.
his
sincerity
is
shown
by
his
willingness
to
be
incarcerated
for
his
beliefs.
the
roots
of
his
beliefs
are
religious.
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
what
are
those
beliefs?
it
is
not
beliefs
or
not
based
on
religious
grounds.
continuing,
he
continues,
the
appellate
sincerely
believes,
that
the
war
in
vietnam
is
wrong
and
that
his
failure
to
object
to
serving
in
vietnam
is
in
violation
of
his
religious
beliefs.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
then
i
am
puzzled
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
am
puzzled
then
your
honor,
why
is
the
solicitor
general
is
serving
that
his
objection
is
political
because
it
was
found
by
the
fact
finder
in
the
case
to
be
religious.3
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
in
his
brief
your
honor,
he
says
that
anyone
who
objects
not
to
world
war,
but
only
to
war
as
defined
in
his
religion
is
objectionable
in
some
fashion,
is
a
necessity
a
political
objector.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
harrington
--
he
didn't
fight
in
vietnam
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
if
the
man
would
have
that
choice,
i
would
say
and
the
catholic
church
says,
he
has
a
religious
duty
to
make
that
choice.
yes,
he
must
definitely
decide.
mr.
richard
harrington
and
that
certainly
is
true
of
the
quaker,
your
honor.
if
a
man,
a
polder
who
wrote
a
book,
the
quaker
is
in
england
and
america,
many
quakers
fought
in
the
revolutionary
war.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
that's
why
we
sought
discharge
form
the
army
because
the
army
here
makes
no
provision
for
him
to
decide
where
he
is
going
to
go.
they
say,
we
have
no
provision.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
he
should
be
discharged.
the
army
has
no
provision
to
--
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
no.
what
the
army
did
is
what
they
did
to
cyrus
pringle.
now
justice
harlan
inquired,
did
congress
always
have
an
exemption.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
in
civil
war,
there
was
no
exemption
for
religious
objectors.
they
took
cyrus
pringle
from
vermont,
they
strapped
a
rifle
on
his
back,
marched
him
to
virginia,
straight
into
the
ground.
he
wouldn't
serve,
he
didn't
serve
and
that's
the
pragmatic
of
a
question.
now
congressman
thetus
in
1940,
the
time
of
great
national
parallel
outline,
what
the
real
pragmatic
problem
here
is,
which
is
quite
different
from
the
specular
problem.
he
said,
if
i
were
to
go
out
and
command
the
troops
and
i
may,
i
don't
want
new
conscientious
objectors
in
my
regiment
at
all.
i
would
rather
they
would
be
some
place
else,
they'd
be
more
bother
than
their
work
and
a
bad
example
to
the
other
man.
he
could
not
do
anything
with
them
in
the
way
of
training
them
to
be
soldiers.
i
am
sure
no
man
who
would
command
the
troops
would
want
them.
now,
the
army's
representatives
who
testified,
agreed.
the
army
didn't
want
these
men
and
you
can
see
why.
who
would
want
a
man
out
in
perimeter
and
one
thing
you
know
about
him
is
he
won't
use
his
weapon.
mr.
richard
harrington
the
alternative,
you
honor,
was
to
overpower
him
with
four
strong
sergeants,
two
on
each
hand,
and
two
on
each
feet,
and
carry
him
off.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
is
not
attending
ready
reserve
meetings,
they
haven't
come
out
yet.
i
don't
know
when
they
will
come
out
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
because
negre
said,
if
i
work
in
the
fort
ord
hospital,
which
i
do
not
regard
as
approximate
participation
in
war,
i
am
helping
sick
people
down
there,
so
i
will
be
prepared
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
objected
to
going
to
vietnam
because
he
said
that
would
be
approximately
participating
in
the
war
which
he
felt
was
--
mr.
richard
harrington
no
one
suggested
that
he
would
be
assigned
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
don't
know
what
he
would
do
if
he
were,
your
honor.
it's
not
in
the
record.
the
record
was
that
he
was
assigned
to
vietnam
and
that
he
refused
to
do.
mr.
richard
harrington
it
was
the
approximate
participation
in
the
war
which
violated
the
tenants
of
his
--
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
this
does
pose
pragmatic
problems
for
the
army
as
their
counsel
asserted
in
lower
court.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
what
i
--
yes,
your
honor,
he
is
attending
ready
reserve
meetings.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
is
kind
of
--
been
solid
by
his
experience
with
the
army,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
the
record
we
have
here,
he
declined
to
participate
in
the
war
at
vietnam
and
he
did
say
that
he
was
willing
to
serve
in
the
capacity
that
was
not
participation
in
war.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
it's
not
your
honor,
the
solicitor
general
in
a
footnote
concedes
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
it's
under
the
(inaudible).
he
has
this
obligation
which
is
of
a
substantial
burden
on
him,
and
he
gets
it
clear
from
his
four
year
reserve
obligation,
fixed
by
10
u.s.c.
270
and
he
can
be
called
to
active
duty
at
anytime
in
the
ready
reserve.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor
into
the
--
just
for
doctrine,
he
had
been
called
upon
the
foremost
conscience
of
our
participation
in
that
war
until
he
was
assigned
to
serve
in
the
war
or
sometime
for
he
could
anticipate
that,
that
would
occur.
and
that
caused
him
then
to
make
a
moral
judgment
did
this
comply
with
religious
judgment
did
it
comply
with
his
religion,
and
that's
when
he
made
the
judgment
and
having
made
the
judgment,
he
then
was
bound
by
his
religion
to
refuse
to
serve.
accordingly,
that's
what
he
did
do,
he
did
refuse
but
he
was,
as
i
say,
carried
off,
nevertheless.
now
i
assert
your
honor,
our
position
is
quite
simple.
it's
an
equal
protection
position
but
if
the
quaker
on
my
right
hand,
says,
i
am
not
going
to
serve
in
the
vietnam
war.
you
say
why
not,
because
of
my
religion.
if
you
compel
the
man,
the
quaker
to
go,
you'd
be
violating
the
statute
certainly.
now,
i
have
a
quaker,
a
catholic
on
my
left
hand,
he
said,
i
am
not
going
to
go.
you
say
why
not?
he
says,
because
of
my
religion.
they
are
both
acting
on
the
command
in
the
bible,
it's
better
to
obey
god
than
man,
they
are
both
acting
as
taught
by
the
religion
but
you
say,
well
you
are
a
felon,
you
have
to
go
because
you
are
catholic.
and
in
quaker,
they
say,
well,
you
may
stay
on.
now,
the
only
difference
is
the
theological
inquisition
you
find
out
as
the
hearing
officer
said,
my
client
describes
abuse
to
the
pope
and
to
the
church.
the
church
doesn't
teach
total
pacifism.
they
say,
therefore,
you
are
not
exempted,
you
are
not
a
total
pacifist.
we
think
this
is
a
manifest
denial
of
equal
protection.
whether
congress
could
abolish
all
exemptions,
i
don't
purport
to
say;
what
i
do
say
is,
it's
crystal
clear
that
they
can't
grant
an
exemption
to
members
of
one
religion
and
deny
it
to
another
by
picking
out
of
this
other
man's
religion,
a
doctrine
of
his
church,
pressing
for
doctrine,
not
even
for
conduct,
not
even
for
conduct.
mr.
richard
harrington
what
permit
him?
not
without
denying
the
authority
of
aquinas,
who
answered
as
i
have
mentioned
to
your
honor,
it's
not
unlawful
to
participate
in
war.
you
must
do
so
where
commanded
by
the
state.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
he
couldn't
form
that
position
without
denying
the
authoritative
teaching
of
the
church
that
there
are
just
wars
in
which
he
must
participate.
so
the
church
might
find
it
to
be
invincible
ignorance,
but
he
wouldn't
be
an
orthodox
catholic.
he
would
then
deny
the
authoritative
teaching
of
his
church
which
is
that
there
are
just
wars
and
if
he
is
assigned
to
serve
in
one,
he
should
serve
in
it,
so
he
can
deny
it,
but
then
he
is
not
a
catholic.
mr.
richard
harrington
catholic
church
doesn't
make
the
decision
in
any
particular
case,
your
honor,
whether
an
act
of
--
if
i
kill
someone,
the
church
doesn't
tell
me
it's
self-defense
or
a
murder.
the
church
sets
some
moral
standard.
i
must
decide
whether
i
have
committed
murder
or
a
self-defense
and
i
am
judged
by
god
in
the
catholic
church
whether
i
am
correct
in
my
decision.
but
the
church
doesn't
--
the
pope
doesn't
issue
letter
saying
that
was
murder
and
that
was
self-defense.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
must
decide
in
each
case
whether
it
meets
the
standards
fixed
by
his
church.
it's
not
up
to
him
what
the
standards
are,
he
is
bound
by
the
church
standards
and
the
church
teaching,
your
honor.
he
must
apply
the
church
standards,
he
can't
apply
his
own,
but
it's
he
who
has
to
apply
them
and
that's
true
for
the
quakers.
the
quaker
decides
whether
he's
a
quaker.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
i
rely
and
welsh
and
seeger,
and
particularly
in
welsh
the
court
conceded
at
least
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
to
exempt
religious
objectors.
mr.
richard
harrington
and
if
my
client
isn't
religious,
i
don't
know
what
religion
is.
all
the
justices
agreed
that
the
religious
objectors
were
intended
by
congress
to
be
exempted.
mr.
richard
harrington
conscience
is
always
individual.
the
voice
of
god
is
registered
on
conscience.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
true.
now
if
the
quakers
can
convert
every
man
of
the
country
to
quakerism,
none
would
go.
that's
true
today.
mr.
richard
harrington
to
the
country,
your
honor,
the
quakers
teach
there
is
no
church
doctrine.
mr.
richard
harrington
george
fox
was
put
in
jail.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
to
the
contrary,
george
fox
was
put
in
jail
for
asserting
that
he
got
messages
directly
from
the
deity,
that
was
regarded
as
blasphemy.
he
says,
i
don't
get
guidance
from
the
church.
each
man
has
life,
that's
conscience.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
--
i
--
it
does
not
invalidate
the
draft
system
your
honor
because
with
that
existing
right,
if
everyone
to
become
a
quaker
if
he
so
desires
--
mr.
richard
harrington
because
most
men
don't
judge
the
war
to
be
unjust
under
the
catholic
standards.
mr.
richard
harrington
if
98%
of
the
country
turn
quaker,
we
wouldn't
have
a
big
army
but
only
11,
10ths
of
1%
of
the
draft
eligible
men
--
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
i
think
congress
could
abolish
the
whole
of
exemption,
then
they
wouldn't
discriminate
against
catholics.
that
would
be
one
solution,
abolish
it
all,
take
them
all,
but
then
your
honor
can
imagine
what
a
pleasure
would
be
to
have
a
division
of
conscientious
objectors,
instead
of
having
like
one
poor
old
negre,
you
would
have
25,000,
30,000
of
these
guys
in
the
army
and
i
don't
think
congress
felt
that
was
practical.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor
if
the
church
isn't
an
anarchic
institution,
it
teaches
obedience
to
the
faith
and
morals
and
it
teaches
obedience
to
the
state,
except
in
the
rare
and
exceptional
case
where
the
commands
of
the
state
violate
god's
commands
and
in
that
case,
they
say
--
mr.
richard
harrington
as
taught
by
the
church,
as
instructed
by
the
church
in
it's
doctrine
--
mr.
richard
harrington
church
has
announced
the
doctrines
that
catholics
must
apply
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
serve.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes.
mr.
richard
harrington
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
absolutely
correct
and
each
must
follow
the
commands
of
conscience
as
the
voice
of
god.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
they
are
applying
the
teaching
of
the
catholic
church.
now
if
a
man
is
just
a
political
objector
and
there
are
some,
there
is
officer's
concern
from
west
point.
they
say,
well,
this
is
a
terrible
political
mistake.
if
i
am
assigned,
i
will
go,
they
say,
that's
a
political
objection.
as
talleyrand
said,
worst
than
the
crime,
it's
a
mistake.
these
are
man
whose
objection
is
solely
political.
they
say,
i
am
wiling
to
serve
in
vietnam,
but
i
say
it's
a
mistake
to
go
politically.
they
are
not
exempt
from
the
army
your
honor.
that's
what
congress
excluded,
though
that's
political
objection.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
if
the
other
man
is
the
quaker,
he
wins
too.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
is
the
presbyterian?
if
this
is
his
religious,
if
the
court
finds
it's
a
religious
belief,
your
honor,
i
say,
it
should
owner
it
for
the
presbyterian
just
as
for
the
quaker.
you
shouldn't
discriminate
against
presbyterians
either.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
well
--
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
constitution
and
the
first
amendment
permit
any
man
to
be
crammed
into
an
orthodox
box.
if
this
is
a
man
of
sincere
personal
religious
belief,
even
though
he
is
a
heretic
to
the
presbyterian,
the
courts
and
the
government
must
recognize
his
religion.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
expended
two-thirds
because
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
am
expending,
because
solicitor
general
says
my
client's
objections
are
political
in
and
off
themselves
and
that's
wholly
untenable.
in
fact,
and
i
have
set
that
out,
i
proved
it's
untenable.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
my
assertion,
not
on
grounds
of
religious
doctrine,
your
honor.
now
for
conduct,
yes.
if
they
want
to
discriminate
on
conduct,
so
that
they
can't
be
bigamous
then
that's
different
law,
but
here
the
conduct
is
the
same.
catholic
declines
to
go
and
the
quaker
declines
to
go.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
certainly
the
first
amendment
is
incorporated
--
fifth
amendment
incorporates
equal
protection
from
the
fourteenth
and
that
goes
into
the
first
amendment.
i
also
have
a
statutory
construction
argument.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
file
erda
(ph)
sheet
sir
dated
yesterday
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
regret.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
certainly
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
did
a
marvelous
job
of
printing
my
brief
on
very
short
notice.
printed
text
is
set
in
the
erda
(ph)
sheet
filed
yesterday
with
the
clerk
and
before
the
court,
and
the
proper
correction
appears
at
page
7
after
line
23,
discriminate
between
just
wars
in
which
he
has
religious
duty
to
participate
and
unjust
wars
in
which
he
has
religious
duty
to
refuse
to
participate.
now
with
my
two
minutes
remaining,
i
will
make
three
points,
which
will
be
a
record
for
(inaudible)
i
hope.
first,
the
solicitor
general,
i
think
never
answered
mr.
justice
white's
inquiry
how
the
constitution
permits
discrimination
between
religions
on
the
grounds
of
belief
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think
his
premise
is
that
--
mr.
richard
harrington
if
your
honor,
please,
that's
correct
and
if
you
accept
the
religious
believes
of
negre
here
to
be
that
he
must
fight
in
just
wars
and
must
refuse
to
fight
unjust
wars
then
that
is
a
discrimination
on
that
--
based
on
that
belief.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
marshall
made
that
it's
the
individual's
religion.
it's
not
the
place
of
government
to
say
you
are
an
orthodox
believer
or
unorthodox.
and
so
with
the
baptist,
would
come
to
the
belief
based
on
his
religion
that
like
the
catholic
he
must
fight
in
just
wars
and
must
refuse
to
fight
in
unjust
war,
and
he
should
get
equal
protection
too
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
harrington
mr.
justice
marshall,
questioned
me
about
--
mr.
richard
harrington
well
if
the
baptist
church
has
such
a
teaching
--
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor
i
think
in
any
religion,
what
i
mean
to
say
and
i
am
not
speaking
as
a
theologian,
before
i
think
our
constitution
does
to
permit
each
of
us
to
have
his
own
religious
beliefs.
mr.
richard
harrington
because
most
of
the
citizens
of
the
country
think
that
the
wars
--
like
to
government
start
just
wars
and
they
go
willingly
and
happily
and
they
are
pleased
to
serve.
mr.
richard
harrington
some
after
they
are
drafted
lose
some
enthusiasm
but
they
are
nevertheless
loyal
soldiers
and
the
number
of
objectors
are
small,
they
are
two
million,
two
college
students,
they
are
only
25,000.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
agree
entirely
and
if
98%
of
the
people
would
adopt
the
religion
and
follow
it,
the
country
would
be
much
better,
but
in
the
field
of
armed
service,
if
they
all
became
pacifists,
we
wouldn't
have
an
army.
if
congress
--
mr.
richard
harrington
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
harrington
or
a
war
and
i
would
devoutly
would
hope
that
the
world
would
come
to
that
condition.
next
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
case
has
not
moot,
it's
not
moot.
mr.
richard
harrington
it's
not
moot,
your
honor
for
three
different
reasons.
number
one,
if
the
application
had
been
granted
when
i
showed
that
my
client
would
been
discharged
and
have
no
reserve
obligation
whatever,
number
two,
we
sought
a
stay
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
since
we
departed
from
the
record
on
the
grounds
of
mootness,
i
should
lay
the
full
record
before
the
court.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
before
this
young
man
went
to
vietnam,
he
amended
his
application
solely
in
this
particular.
he
said,
after
what's
happened
to
be,
i
am
unwilling
to
serve
in
the
united
states
army
anywhere
because
it
now
well
appears
to
me
constitute
aiding
and
abetting
this
immoral
war,
which
violates
my
religion.
now
the
solicitor
general
never
suggested
--
mr.
richard
harrington
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
harrington
it
was
judge
zirpoli
pointed
out
during
the
trial
that
he
was
aiding
and
abetting
the
war
by
releasing
another
man
to
go
and
after
he
got
that
admonition
from
judge
zirpoli
and
after
this
court
a
denied
stay,
he
then
gave
that
consideration
and
he
did
amend
his
application
in
that
particular
law.
now
therefore
the
case
is
not
moot.
the
young
man
feels
that
he
should
not
participate
in
this
war,
even
by
aiding
it
and
abetting
it.
and
thirdly,
as
i
point
out
to
you,
your
honors,
we
did
seek
a
stay
before
he
went
to
vietnam.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes
he
is.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
this
case
your
honor.
before
he
went
we
sued
out
that
writ.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
we
have
to
start
a
new
writ,
your
honor.
i
simply
say
if
mitchel
is
the
law
that
he
can't
raised
before
he
is
in
the
army
and
this
court
will
not
stay
after
he
is
in
the
army
and
then
we
get
to
this
court
having
exhausted
our
remedies,
we
are
too
late.
there
won't
be
many
cases
from
where
we
will
be
able
to
present
our
position
because
there
never
be
any
right
time.
we
respectfully
submit,
we
exhausted,
we
tried
to
be
diligent.
we
moot
as
quickly
as
we
could,
this
is
why
we
are
in
this
court,
he
is
entitled
to
be
discharged
under
the
constitution
and
equal
protection
and
we
ask
that
he
be
discharged.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
harrington
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
louis
negre.
louis
negre
is
a
young
man
who
is
a
catholic
conscientious
objector.
he
sought
discharge
from
the
united
states
armed
forces
when
he
was
assigned
to
serve
in
vietnam.
and
his
application
for
conscientious
objection
discharge
having
been
denied
by
the
army
on
the
grounds
that
was
based
on
personal
moral
code.
he
was
assigned
to
go
to
vietnam.
so,
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
the
war
in
which
he
was
asked
to
serve
was
the
war
to
which
he
objects.
he
had
standing
to
object
to
serving
in
that
particular
war,
to
which
he
was
assigned.
he
sought
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
before
judge
zirpoli
in
san
francisco,
to
restrain
the
army
from
shipping
him
to
vietnam
to
take
part
in
that
war
and
to
be
discharged
as
a
religious
objector.
judge
zirpoli
denied
his
application
for
habeas
corpus
on
grounds
set
out
in
his
opinion
and
in
the
course
of
argument,
he
made
the
observation,
“that
even
if
my
client
mr.
negre
were
willing
to
serve
in
united
states,
but
under
the
common
law
concept,
he
would
be
aiding
and
abetting
the
war.”
my
client
relied
however,
on
the
concept
that
was
traditional
in
the
law
and
also
in
logic
between
approximate
and
remote
participation.
he
indicated
that
he'll
do
a
practical
distinction
that
he
would
not
participate
in
any
form
in
the
war,
but
like
the
man
in
kansas
who
was
against
world
war
ii,
and
he
was
a
railroad
switchman,
he
did
not
decline
to
flip
the
switches
when
the
railroad
troop
trains
came
through
and
that
was
charged
against
him
that
he
was
willing
to
participate
in
war.
of
course,
it
would
be
nonsense
to
say
that
a
man
has
to
close
his
eyes
when
the
troop
train
goes
by
or
else
he
is
participating
in
war.
there
is
a
distinction
between
non-participation
and
participation.
my
client
refused
to
participate
and
refused
to
participate
in
vietnam.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
made
his
first
claim,
your
honor,
approximately
four
months
after
induction
into
the
service
and
after
he
had
been
assigned
to
serve
in
vietnam.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think
the
latter,
your
honor.
he
was
a
roman
catholic
and
as
i
have
been
at
pains
to
set
out
in
my
briefs
and
as
it's
set
out
by
the
army
hearing
officer
--
mr.
richard
harrington
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor,
the
army's
answer
to
that
in
judge
zirpoli's
court
was
they
had
no
provision
for
canceling
his
assignment
to
vietnam.
on
the
pragmatic
side,
the
army
puts
the
practicalities
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
does.
it
says,
we
don't
have
any
form
of
duty,
where
a
man
can
say,
i'll
serve
here,
but
i
won't
serve
there.
they
said
--
mr.
richard
harrington
his
position
was
taken
only
because
the
army
said
it
had
no
assignment
for
him
except
to
compel
him
to
participate
in
the
war
in
vietnam
and
that's
where
indeed
they
carried
him.
they
assigned
four
sergeants,
put
them
on
an
airplane
and
carried
him
to
vietnam,
after
this
court
refused
to
entertain
stay.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
has
four
year
army
reserve
obligation
and
i
presume
the
next
time
your
honor
that
they
want
him
to
serve,
they
will
pick
them
up
again
and
take
him
again,
as
they
have
done
on
the
prior
occasion.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
was
acquitted
because
the
army
didn't
follow
its
own
procedures
in
processing
his
application.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
filed
the
first
application
which
was
summary,
because
hastily
prepared,
that
was
denied.
he
filed
a
second
application
supported
with
citation
of
religious
authority
and
letters
from
friends.
the
army
said
that's
just
the
same,
but
the
army
could
not
persuade
the
court-martial
it
was
just
the
same.
the
seven
combat
veterans
on
the
court-martial
said
that's
entirely
different,
please
process
the
second
application.
the
second
application
was
then
denied.
he
again
declined
to
go
to
vietnam.
i
suggest
that
that
court-martial
him,
he
was
ready
to
stay
in
court-martial,
but
they
carried
him
off
instead.
mr.
richard
harrington
four
months.
mr.
richard
harrington
came
home.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
not
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
he
did.
mr.
richard
harrington
now
in
the
ready
reserve,
with
a
four-year
obligation,
to
be
called
on
the
order
of
president
or
for
failing
to
meet
his
ready
reserve
obligations
at
any
time.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
there
is
--
the
solicitor
general
takes
the
view
that
that
puts
them
in
the
realm
of
politics,
but
if
you
look
at
the
catholic
religion
--
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
hasn't
addressed
himself
to
it,
but
i
can
answer
that,
as
follows.
aquinas
and
his
treaties,
part
ll,
section
2,
question
40,
put
that
very
question
and
he
said,
the
question
is
that
it
is
always
simple
to
participate
in
war,
his
answer
was
no,
that
was
1272,
teachings
of
aquinas
by
canon
1366
of
canon
law
with
the
roman
catholic
church
is
binding,
teaching
in
all
catholics.
and
that
doctrine
was
reaffirmed
not
only
by
aquinas,
but
i
just
counted
them
in
the
brief
by
st.
augustine,
by
victoria
salamanca
1520,
(inaudible)
1787.
the
baltimore
catechism
1949,
vatican
ii
1965
and
the
american
bishops.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think,
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct.
whatever
the
differences
of
the
court
were
--
mr.
richard
harrington
it's
based
on
based
on
older
religion,
and
i
am
astonished
at
the
suggestion
by
the
government
that
is
not
a
religious
belief
because
--
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
not
only
leaves
it,
it
mandates
the
individual,
who
exercises
conscience,
because
it's
the
individual
who
is
judged.
as
mr.
negre
pointed
out
in
his
application,
the
church
isn't
judged
--
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
the
church
has
specific
definition
of
objector
to
consider
--
mr.
richard
harrington
the
church
does
not
take
any
possession
on
any
factual
--
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
it's
call
examination
or
formation
of
conscious
and
you
have
a
duty
to
properly
form
your
conscious.
again,
as
aquinas
points
out,
you
commit
a
mistake
which
is
objectively
a
mistake,
you
are
not
guilty
of
moral
fault
for
the
mistake,
but
you
maybe
guilty
of
moral
fault
if
you
haven't
properly
formed
your
conscious
by
careful
study,
inquiry,
prayer
and
investigation,
as
far
as,
you
may
enter
the
matter.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
it
says,
the
fact
is,
starting
from
aquinas
as
i
say
in
1272,
they
are
often
broken
down
into
lists,
whether
the
war
was
declared
by
the
properly
constituted
government
is
one
factor.
whether
it's
conducted
in
defense
as
opposed
to
a
war
of
aggression
is
another
factor.
whether
the
means
used
are
proper
means
and
do
not
injure
civilian
populations,
who
are
not
combatants
is
the
third
factor.
accordingly,
there
are
factors
which
have
different
numbers
on
different
lists,
but
they
go
to
the
justice
of
the
war
in
broad
sense.
now,
one
of
the
tests
is
whether
the
harm
done
exceeds
the
gain
that
maybe
expected
from
the
war,
in
other
words,
and
this
(inaudible).
mr.
richard
harrington
always
--
mr.
richard
harrington
always
and
that's
also
true
of
the
quaker.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
i
think
the
function
that
was
outlined
correctly
in
the
seeger
opinion
that
what
the
government,
draft
warrant
or
hearing
officer
has
to
do
is
to
determine
are
the
beliefs
religious
and
are
they
second,
sincerely
held.
once
they
are
found
to
be
religious
and
sincerely
held,
its
no
part
of
government
to
put
on
its
theological
half
and
say,
well,
my
friend
you
say
its
religious
and
you
have
supporting
letters
that
it's
religious,
but
we
have
the
government
theologian
sitting
here
and
he
wants
to
engage
in
a
theological
inquisition,
whether
you
are
an
orthodox
catholic?
did
you
go
to
church
four
times
last
month?
have
you
take
confession?
that's
no
part
of
government.
what
is
the
government's
function
as
announced
in
seeger
is
to
determine
why
is
the
belief
religious,
however
that
doctrine
maybe
interpreted.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think,
the
solicitor
general
contends
that
my
client's
objection
is
political.
his
brief
says
that
despite
the
fact
he
is
resting
it
upon
teaching
of
the
roman
catholic
church
which
has
been
uniform
for
2000
years
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
army
hearing
officer,
in
his
findings
set
out
at
appendix
837
said
the
following.
“his
religious
training
has
been
extensive
and
he
was
extremely
devout.
his
sincerity
is
shown
by
his
willingness
to
be
incarcerated
for
his
beliefs.
the
roots
of
his
beliefs
are
religious.
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
what
are
those
beliefs?
it
is
not
beliefs
or
not
based
on
religious
grounds.
continuing,
he
continues,
the
appellate
sincerely
believes,
that
the
war
in
vietnam
is
wrong
and
that
his
failure
to
object
to
serving
in
vietnam
is
in
violation
of
his
religious
beliefs.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
then
i
am
puzzled
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
am
puzzled
then
your
honor,
why
is
the
solicitor
general
is
serving
that
his
objection
is
political
because
it
was
found
by
the
fact
finder
in
the
case
to
be
religious.3
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
in
his
brief
your
honor,
he
says
that
anyone
who
objects
not
to
world
war,
but
only
to
war
as
defined
in
his
religion
is
objectionable
in
some
fashion,
is
a
necessity
a
political
objector.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
harrington
--
he
didn't
fight
in
vietnam
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
if
the
man
would
have
that
choice,
i
would
say
and
the
catholic
church
says,
he
has
a
religious
duty
to
make
that
choice.
yes,
he
must
definitely
decide.
mr.
richard
harrington
and
that
certainly
is
true
of
the
quaker,
your
honor.
if
a
man,
a
polder
who
wrote
a
book,
the
quaker
is
in
england
and
america,
many
quakers
fought
in
the
revolutionary
war.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
that's
why
we
sought
discharge
form
the
army
because
the
army
here
makes
no
provision
for
him
to
decide
where
he
is
going
to
go.
they
say,
we
have
no
provision.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
he
should
be
discharged.
the
army
has
no
provision
to
--
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
no.
what
the
army
did
is
what
they
did
to
cyrus
pringle.
now
justice
harlan
inquired,
did
congress
always
have
an
exemption.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
in
civil
war,
there
was
no
exemption
for
religious
objectors.
they
took
cyrus
pringle
from
vermont,
they
strapped
a
rifle
on
his
back,
marched
him
to
virginia,
straight
into
the
ground.
he
wouldn't
serve,
he
didn't
serve
and
that's
the
pragmatic
of
a
question.
now
congressman
thetus
in
1940,
the
time
of
great
national
parallel
outline,
what
the
real
pragmatic
problem
here
is,
which
is
quite
different
from
the
specular
problem.
he
said,
if
i
were
to
go
out
and
command
the
troops
and
i
may,
i
don't
want
new
conscientious
objectors
in
my
regiment
at
all.
i
would
rather
they
would
be
some
place
else,
they'd
be
more
bother
than
their
work
and
a
bad
example
to
the
other
man.
he
could
not
do
anything
with
them
in
the
way
of
training
them
to
be
soldiers.
i
am
sure
no
man
who
would
command
the
troops
would
want
them.
now,
the
army's
representatives
who
testified,
agreed.
the
army
didn't
want
these
men
and
you
can
see
why.
who
would
want
a
man
out
in
perimeter
and
one
thing
you
know
about
him
is
he
won't
use
his
weapon.
mr.
richard
harrington
the
alternative,
you
honor,
was
to
overpower
him
with
four
strong
sergeants,
two
on
each
hand,
and
two
on
each
feet,
and
carry
him
off.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
is
not
attending
ready
reserve
meetings,
they
haven't
come
out
yet.
i
don't
know
when
they
will
come
out
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
because
negre
said,
if
i
work
in
the
fort
ord
hospital,
which
i
do
not
regard
as
approximate
participation
in
war,
i
am
helping
sick
people
down
there,
so
i
will
be
prepared
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
objected
to
going
to
vietnam
because
he
said
that
would
be
approximately
participating
in
the
war
which
he
felt
was
--
mr.
richard
harrington
no
one
suggested
that
he
would
be
assigned
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
don't
know
what
he
would
do
if
he
were,
your
honor.
it's
not
in
the
record.
the
record
was
that
he
was
assigned
to
vietnam
and
that
he
refused
to
do.
mr.
richard
harrington
it
was
the
approximate
participation
in
the
war
which
violated
the
tenants
of
his
--
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
this
does
pose
pragmatic
problems
for
the
army
as
their
counsel
asserted
in
lower
court.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
what
i
--
yes,
your
honor,
he
is
attending
ready
reserve
meetings.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
he
is
kind
of
--
been
solid
by
his
experience
with
the
army,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
the
record
we
have
here,
he
declined
to
participate
in
the
war
at
vietnam
and
he
did
say
that
he
was
willing
to
serve
in
the
capacity
that
was
not
participation
in
war.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
it's
not
your
honor,
the
solicitor
general
in
a
footnote
concedes
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
it's
under
the
(inaudible).
he
has
this
obligation
which
is
of
a
substantial
burden
on
him,
and
he
gets
it
clear
from
his
four
year
reserve
obligation,
fixed
by
10
u.s.c.
270
and
he
can
be
called
to
active
duty
at
anytime
in
the
ready
reserve.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor
into
the
--
just
for
doctrine,
he
had
been
called
upon
the
foremost
conscience
of
our
participation
in
that
war
until
he
was
assigned
to
serve
in
the
war
or
sometime
for
he
could
anticipate
that,
that
would
occur.
and
that
caused
him
then
to
make
a
moral
judgment
did
this
comply
with
religious
judgment
did
it
comply
with
his
religion,
and
that's
when
he
made
the
judgment
and
having
made
the
judgment,
he
then
was
bound
by
his
religion
to
refuse
to
serve.
accordingly,
that's
what
he
did
do,
he
did
refuse
but
he
was,
as
i
say,
carried
off,
nevertheless.
now
i
assert
your
honor,
our
position
is
quite
simple.
it's
an
equal
protection
position
but
if
the
quaker
on
my
right
hand,
says,
i
am
not
going
to
serve
in
the
vietnam
war.
you
say
why
not,
because
of
my
religion.
if
you
compel
the
man,
the
quaker
to
go,
you'd
be
violating
the
statute
certainly.
now,
i
have
a
quaker,
a
catholic
on
my
left
hand,
he
said,
i
am
not
going
to
go.
you
say
why
not?
he
says,
because
of
my
religion.
they
are
both
acting
on
the
command
in
the
bible,
it's
better
to
obey
god
than
man,
they
are
both
acting
as
taught
by
the
religion
but
you
say,
well
you
are
a
felon,
you
have
to
go
because
you
are
catholic.
and
in
quaker,
they
say,
well,
you
may
stay
on.
now,
the
only
difference
is
the
theological
inquisition
you
find
out
as
the
hearing
officer
said,
my
client
describes
abuse
to
the
pope
and
to
the
church.
the
church
doesn't
teach
total
pacifism.
they
say,
therefore,
you
are
not
exempted,
you
are
not
a
total
pacifist.
we
think
this
is
a
manifest
denial
of
equal
protection.
whether
congress
could
abolish
all
exemptions,
i
don't
purport
to
say;
what
i
do
say
is,
it's
crystal
clear
that
they
can't
grant
an
exemption
to
members
of
one
religion
and
deny
it
to
another
by
picking
out
of
this
other
man's
religion,
a
doctrine
of
his
church,
pressing
for
doctrine,
not
even
for
conduct,
not
even
for
conduct.
mr.
richard
harrington
what
permit
him?
not
without
denying
the
authority
of
aquinas,
who
answered
as
i
have
mentioned
to
your
honor,
it's
not
unlawful
to
participate
in
war.
you
must
do
so
where
commanded
by
the
state.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
he
couldn't
form
that
position
without
denying
the
authoritative
teaching
of
the
church
that
there
are
just
wars
in
which
he
must
participate.
so
the
church
might
find
it
to
be
invincible
ignorance,
but
he
wouldn't
be
an
orthodox
catholic.
he
would
then
deny
the
authoritative
teaching
of
his
church
which
is
that
there
are
just
wars
and
if
he
is
assigned
to
serve
in
one,
he
should
serve
in
it,
so
he
can
deny
it,
but
then
he
is
not
a
catholic.
mr.
richard
harrington
catholic
church
doesn't
make
the
decision
in
any
particular
case,
your
honor,
whether
an
act
of
--
if
i
kill
someone,
the
church
doesn't
tell
me
it's
self-defense
or
a
murder.
the
church
sets
some
moral
standard.
i
must
decide
whether
i
have
committed
murder
or
a
self-defense
and
i
am
judged
by
god
in
the
catholic
church
whether
i
am
correct
in
my
decision.
but
the
church
doesn't
--
the
pope
doesn't
issue
letter
saying
that
was
murder
and
that
was
self-defense.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
must
decide
in
each
case
whether
it
meets
the
standards
fixed
by
his
church.
it's
not
up
to
him
what
the
standards
are,
he
is
bound
by
the
church
standards
and
the
church
teaching,
your
honor.
he
must
apply
the
church
standards,
he
can't
apply
his
own,
but
it's
he
who
has
to
apply
them
and
that's
true
for
the
quakers.
the
quaker
decides
whether
he's
a
quaker.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
i
rely
and
welsh
and
seeger,
and
particularly
in
welsh
the
court
conceded
at
least
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
to
exempt
religious
objectors.
mr.
richard
harrington
and
if
my
client
isn't
religious,
i
don't
know
what
religion
is.
all
the
justices
agreed
that
the
religious
objectors
were
intended
by
congress
to
be
exempted.
mr.
richard
harrington
conscience
is
always
individual.
the
voice
of
god
is
registered
on
conscience.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
true.
now
if
the
quakers
can
convert
every
man
of
the
country
to
quakerism,
none
would
go.
that's
true
today.
mr.
richard
harrington
to
the
country,
your
honor,
the
quakers
teach
there
is
no
church
doctrine.
mr.
richard
harrington
george
fox
was
put
in
jail.
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
to
the
contrary,
george
fox
was
put
in
jail
for
asserting
that
he
got
messages
directly
from
the
deity,
that
was
regarded
as
blasphemy.
he
says,
i
don't
get
guidance
from
the
church.
each
man
has
life,
that's
conscience.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
--
i
--
it
does
not
invalidate
the
draft
system
your
honor
because
with
that
existing
right,
if
everyone
to
become
a
quaker
if
he
so
desires
--
mr.
richard
harrington
because
most
men
don't
judge
the
war
to
be
unjust
under
the
catholic
standards.
mr.
richard
harrington
if
98%
of
the
country
turn
quaker,
we
wouldn't
have
a
big
army
but
only
11,
10ths
of
1%
of
the
draft
eligible
men
--
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
i
think
congress
could
abolish
the
whole
of
exemption,
then
they
wouldn't
discriminate
against
catholics.
that
would
be
one
solution,
abolish
it
all,
take
them
all,
but
then
your
honor
can
imagine
what
a
pleasure
would
be
to
have
a
division
of
conscientious
objectors,
instead
of
having
like
one
poor
old
negre,
you
would
have
25,000,
30,000
of
these
guys
in
the
army
and
i
don't
think
congress
felt
that
was
practical.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor
if
the
church
isn't
an
anarchic
institution,
it
teaches
obedience
to
the
faith
and
morals
and
it
teaches
obedience
to
the
state,
except
in
the
rare
and
exceptional
case
where
the
commands
of
the
state
violate
god's
commands
and
in
that
case,
they
say
--
mr.
richard
harrington
as
taught
by
the
church,
as
instructed
by
the
church
in
it's
doctrine
--
mr.
richard
harrington
church
has
announced
the
doctrines
that
catholics
must
apply
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
serve.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes.
mr.
richard
harrington
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
absolutely
correct
and
each
must
follow
the
commands
of
conscience
as
the
voice
of
god.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
they
are
applying
the
teaching
of
the
catholic
church.
now
if
a
man
is
just
a
political
objector
and
there
are
some,
there
is
officer's
concern
from
west
point.
they
say,
well,
this
is
a
terrible
political
mistake.
if
i
am
assigned,
i
will
go,
they
say,
that's
a
political
objection.
as
talleyrand
said,
worst
than
the
crime,
it's
a
mistake.
these
are
man
whose
objection
is
solely
political.
they
say,
i
am
wiling
to
serve
in
vietnam,
but
i
say
it's
a
mistake
to
go
politically.
they
are
not
exempt
from
the
army
your
honor.
that's
what
congress
excluded,
though
that's
political
objection.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
if
the
other
man
is
the
quaker,
he
wins
too.
mr.
richard
harrington
he
is
the
presbyterian?
if
this
is
his
religious,
if
the
court
finds
it's
a
religious
belief,
your
honor,
i
say,
it
should
owner
it
for
the
presbyterian
just
as
for
the
quaker.
you
shouldn't
discriminate
against
presbyterians
either.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
well
--
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
constitution
and
the
first
amendment
permit
any
man
to
be
crammed
into
an
orthodox
box.
if
this
is
a
man
of
sincere
personal
religious
belief,
even
though
he
is
a
heretic
to
the
presbyterian,
the
courts
and
the
government
must
recognize
his
religion.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
expended
two-thirds
because
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
am
expending,
because
solicitor
general
says
my
client's
objections
are
political
in
and
off
themselves
and
that's
wholly
untenable.
in
fact,
and
i
have
set
that
out,
i
proved
it's
untenable.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
my
assertion,
not
on
grounds
of
religious
doctrine,
your
honor.
now
for
conduct,
yes.
if
they
want
to
discriminate
on
conduct,
so
that
they
can't
be
bigamous
then
that's
different
law,
but
here
the
conduct
is
the
same.
catholic
declines
to
go
and
the
quaker
declines
to
go.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
harrington
yes,
certainly
the
first
amendment
is
incorporated
--
fifth
amendment
incorporates
equal
protection
from
the
fourteenth
and
that
goes
into
the
first
amendment.
i
also
have
a
statutory
construction
argument.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
file
erda
(ph)
sheet
sir
dated
yesterday
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
regret.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
certainly
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
harrington
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
did
a
marvelous
job
of
printing
my
brief
on
very
short
notice.
printed
text
is
set
in
the
erda
(ph)
sheet
filed
yesterday
with
the
clerk
and
before
the
court,
and
the
proper
correction
appears
at
page
7
after
line
23,
discriminate
between
just
wars
in
which
he
has
religious
duty
to
participate
and
unjust
wars
in
which
he
has
religious
duty
to
refuse
to
participate.
now
with
my
two
minutes
remaining,
i
will
make
three
points,
which
will
be
a
record
for
(inaudible)
i
hope.
first,
the
solicitor
general,
i
think
never
answered
mr.
justice
white's
inquiry
how
the
constitution
permits
discrimination
between
religions
on
the
grounds
of
belief
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
harrington
i
think
his
premise
is
that
--
mr.
richard
harrington
if
your
honor,
please,
that's
correct
and
if
you
accept
the
religious
believes
of
negre
here
to
be
that
he
must
fight
in
just
wars
and
must
refuse
to
fight
unjust
wars
then
that
is
a
discrimination
on
that
--
based
on
that
belief.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
marshall
made
that
it's
the
individual's
religion.
it's
not
the
place
of
government
to
say
you
are
an
orthodox
believer
or
unorthodox.
and
so
with
the
baptist,
would
come
to
the
belief
based
on
his
religion
that
like
the
catholic
he
must
fight
in
just
wars
and
must
refuse
to
fight
in
unjust
war,
and
he
should
get
equal
protection
too
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
harrington
mr.
justice
marshall,
questioned
me
about
--
mr.
richard
harrington
well
if
the
baptist
church
has
such
a
teaching
--
mr.
richard
harrington
your
honor
i
think
in
any
religion,
what
i
mean
to
say
and
i
am
not
speaking
as
a
theologian,
before
i
think
our
constitution
does
to
permit
each
of
us
to
have
his
own
religious
beliefs.
mr.
richard
harrington
because
most
of
the
citizens
of
the
country
think
that
the
wars
--
like
to
government
start
just
wars
and
they
go
willingly
and
happily
and
they
are
pleased
to
serve.
mr.
richard
harrington
some
after
they
are
drafted
lose
some
enthusiasm
but
they
are
nevertheless
loyal
soldiers
and
the
number
of
objectors
are
small,
they
are
two
million,
two
college
students,
they
are
only
25,000.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
richard
harrington
i
agree
entirely
and
if
98%
of
the
people
would
adopt
the
religion
and
follow
it,
the
country
would
be
much
better,
but
in
the
field
of
armed
service,
if
they
all
became
pacifists,
we
wouldn't
have
an
army.
if
congress
--
mr.
richard
harrington
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
harrington
or
a
war
and
i
would
devoutly
would
hope
that
the
world
would
come
to
that
condition.
next
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
case
has
not
moot,
it's
not
moot.
mr.
richard
harrington
it's
not
moot,
your
honor
for
three
different
reasons.
number
one,
if
the
application
had
been
granted
when
i
showed
that
my
client
would
been
discharged
and
have
no
reserve
obligation
whatever,
number
two,
we
sought
a
stay
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
harrington
well,
your
honor,
since
we
departed
from
the
record
on
the
grounds
of
mootness,
i
should
lay
the
full
record
before
the
court.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
before
this
young
man
went
to
vietnam,
he
amended
his
application
solely
in
this
particular.
he
said,
after
what's
happened
to
be,
i
am
unwilling
to
serve
in
the
united
states
army
anywhere
because
it
now
well
appears
to
me
constitute
aiding
and
abetting
this
immoral
war,
which
violates
my
religion.
now
the
solicitor
general
never
suggested
--
mr.
richard
harrington
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
harrington
it
was
judge
zirpoli
pointed
out
during
the
trial
that
he
was
aiding
and
abetting
the
war
by
releasing
another
man
to
go
and
after
he
got
that
admonition
from
judge
zirpoli
and
after
this
court
a
denied
stay,
he
then
gave
that
consideration
and
he
did
amend
his
application
in
that
particular
law.
now
therefore
the
case
is
not
moot.
the
young
man
feels
that
he
should
not
participate
in
this
war,
even
by
aiding
it
and
abetting
it.
and
thirdly,
as
i
point
out
to
you,
your
honors,
we
did
seek
a
stay
before
he
went
to
vietnam.
mr.
richard
harrington
yes
he
is.
mr.
richard
harrington
that's
this
case
your
honor.
before
he
went
we
sued
out
that
writ.
mr.
richard
harrington
no,
we
have
to
start
a
new
writ,
your
honor.
i
simply
say
if
mitchel
is
the
law
that
he
can't
raised
before
he
is
in
the
army
and
this
court
will
not
stay
after
he
is
in
the
army
and
then
we
get
to
this
court
having
exhausted
our
remedies,
we
are
too
late.
there
won't
be
many
cases
from
where
we
will
be
able
to
present
our
position
because
there
never
be
any
right
time.
we
respectfully
submit,
we
exhausted,
we
tried
to
be
diligent.
we
moot
as
quickly
as
we
could,
this
is
why
we
are
in
this
court,
he
is
entitled
to
be
discharged
under
the
constitution
and
equal
protection
and
we
ask
that
he
be
discharged.
thank
you.
