justice
potter
stewart
he
is
now
back
in
this
country
and
remains
in
the
army
reserve.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
was
--
as
i
read
your
brief
he
was
ordered
to
vietnam,
he
refused,
he
was
then
court-martialed
for
refusal
to
bail
off
order
and
he
was
acquitted,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
not
waiving
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
long
did
he
stay
there?
justice
potter
stewart
then
came
home?
justice
potter
stewart
by
military
transportation
as
a
result
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
know
whether
he
came
home,
how
came
home
and
is
now
in
the
not
the
ready
reserve
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
that
wasn't
an
issue
here,
anymore
than
it
was
in
the
last
case?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
i
don't
think
there
is
any
issue
about
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
you
don't
understand
my
question.
i
didn't
it
understand
that
the
solicitor
genera
was
making
any
such
contention.
you
say
you
do
and
where
is
that
in
his
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
the
practical
difficulty
in
the
future
cases
is
what
he
is
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
now
let's
say
he
is
presbyterian?
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
it.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do,
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
your
contention
at
all
that
in
this
case,
that
sentence
that
you
read
to
us,
about
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophical
views
or
merely
personal
moral
code,
is
it
any
part
of
your
contention
in
this
case,
that
the
petitioner
here
comes
within
that
sentence,
that
his
beliefs
come
within
that
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ones
you
have
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
as
used
in
this
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
had
not
understood
that
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
thought
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i
thought
the
issue
was
rather
than
the
issue
being
whether
or
not
he
was
religiously
motivated?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
--
then
i
misunderstood.
i
wholly
misunderstood
you
answer
to
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
either.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
neither.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
court
opinion
in
the
welsh
case,
mr.
lynn?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
not
an
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
welsh
case,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
there
was
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black,
joined
by
three
other
members
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
not
a
court
opinion,
of
course,
that
was
not
a
majority
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
was
another
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
quite
a
different
rationale,
led
him
to
join
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
there
was
not
a
court
opinion
in
other
words
in
the
welsh
case
if
my
recollection
serves
me?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
judgment
for
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
did
not
at
all
join
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you're
now
relying
on
it
and
of
course,
four
judges
just
don't
make
a
court.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
this
case,
however,
mr.
lynn,
i
think
and
as
i
think
you
said
at
the
outset
of
your
argument,
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
gillette's
opposition
to
the
vietnam
war
is
motivated
by
sincerely
held
religious
training
and
belief
to
quote
the
statute
at
least
as
construed
in
the
seeger
case,
at
least
there
was
a
court
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
i
think
that
is
not
an
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
virtually
conceded
that
mr.
gillette's
opposition
to
what's
going
on
in
southeast
asia
is
supported
by
religious
training
and
belief.
the
only
question
is,
since
he
is
not
indicated
an
all
out
opposition
to
all
war,
whether
or
not
in
the
statute
or
if
not
the
statute,
then
the
constitution
requires
that
he
would
be
exempted
along
with
those
whose
opposition,
religious
opposition
is
to
all
war.
isn't
that
really
the
issue
is?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
our
armed
forces
are
involved
in
vietnam?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
a
person
has
opposed
to
all
war
by
reason
of
religious
training
and
belief,
it
follows
that
for
him
to
serve
in
the
military
impinges
seriously
upon
his
religious
training
and
belief.
but
if
a
person
is
opposed
only
to
what's
going
on
in
vietnam
by
reason
of
his
military
--
by
his
religious
training
and
belief,
then
it
does
not
follow
that
it
impinges
upon
his
religious
training
and
belief
to
serve
in
the
united
states
of
america,
with
the
forces
dedicated
to
the
territorial
defense
of
this
nation,
or
even
to
serve
in
west
germany
or
in
belgium,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
serving
in
the
coast
artillery
on
one
of
the
coasts
of
the
continent
of
united
states
would
not
be
getting
involved
with
the
peasantry
in
vietnam,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
i
correct
in
understanding
that
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
the
fact
that
his
conscientious
objection,
quite
apart
from
the
scope
of
it,
is
statutorily
supported
that
is
based
upon
his
religious
training
and
belief
as
that
statutory
phrase
was
construed
in
the
seeger
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
wasn't
adumbrated
in
the
welsh
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
welsh
case,
there
were
four
members
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
four
other
members
of
the
court
hardly
disagreed
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
asking
us
read
it
as
so
we
had
written
in
any
form
of
war
rather
than
participation
in
any
form
in
war?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
in
any
form
modifies
war
rather
than
participation,
that's
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
could
he,
because
he
obviously
could,
couldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
there
was
--
to
go
back,
there
was
absolutely
no
issue
at
all
about
the
basis
of
this
man's
opposition
to
vietnam.
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
difficulties
of
proof
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
now
back
in
this
country
and
remains
in
the
army
reserve.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
was
--
as
i
read
your
brief
he
was
ordered
to
vietnam,
he
refused,
he
was
then
court-martialed
for
refusal
to
bail
off
order
and
he
was
acquitted,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
not
waiving
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
long
did
he
stay
there?
justice
potter
stewart
then
came
home?
justice
potter
stewart
by
military
transportation
as
a
result
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
know
whether
he
came
home,
how
came
home
and
is
now
in
the
not
the
ready
reserve
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
that
wasn't
an
issue
here,
anymore
than
it
was
in
the
last
case?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
i
don't
think
there
is
any
issue
about
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
you
don't
understand
my
question.
i
didn't
it
understand
that
the
solicitor
genera
was
making
any
such
contention.
you
say
you
do
and
where
is
that
in
his
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
the
practical
difficulty
in
the
future
cases
is
what
he
is
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
now
let's
say
he
is
presbyterian?
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
it.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
do,
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
your
contention
at
all
that
in
this
case,
that
sentence
that
you
read
to
us,
about
essentially
political,
sociological,
or
philosophical
views
or
merely
personal
moral
code,
is
it
any
part
of
your
contention
in
this
case,
that
the
petitioner
here
comes
within
that
sentence,
that
his
beliefs
come
within
that
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ones
you
have
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
as
used
in
this
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
had
not
understood
that
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
thought
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i

was
rather
than
the

being
whether
or
not
he
was
religiously
motivated?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
--
then
i
misunderstood.
i
wholly
misunderstood
you
answer
to
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
either.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
neither.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
court
opinion
in
the
welsh
case,
mr.
lynn?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
not
an
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
welsh
case,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
there
was
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black,
joined
by
three
other
members
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
not
a
court

of

that
was
not

justice

and

if
my

justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
judgment
for
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
did
not
at
all
join
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you're
now
relying
on
it
and
of
course,
four
judges
just
don't
make
a
court.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
this

however,
mr.
