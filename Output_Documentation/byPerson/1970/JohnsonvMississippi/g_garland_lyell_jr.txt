mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
say
this
at
the
outset
that
judge
perry
is
an
old
friend
of
mine,
a
classmate
and
i've
known
him
for
years
and
he
has
his
way
of
doing
things
sometimes
rather
unpredictable
frankly.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
judge
that
imposed
this
sentence.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
grenada
county,
yes.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
same
judge
and
i
come
to
my
reason
for
making
that
opinion
(inaudible)
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
what
the
defendant
published
a
report
at
the
time,
this
brief
once
affirmed.
without
all
the
fly
outs
of
bias
and
prejudice
that
may
have
existed,
assuming
for
argument
on
in
front
judge
perry
towards
this
so-called
civil
rights
worker
or
whoever
he
might
be,
i
don’t
see
it
he’s
in
any
position
to
complain
of
the
procedures
that
was
used
against
him.
if
judge
perry
heard
those
contemptuous
remarks
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
he
said
he
did
in
the
petition
that
he
instructed
the
show
cause
petition
or
information
which
he
instructed
to
prosecute
it
to
prepare.
i
think
that’s
where
the
prosecutor
who
decided
and
who
prepared
it
said,
it
was
reported
to
judge
perry.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but
you’ll
find
in
the
record
that
judge
perry
himself
stated
that
he
heard
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
could
have
been
both
and
like
here
is
a
question
of
counsel.
but
i
might
add
this,
even
though,
the
punishment
was
not
summarily
imposed
which
he
had
a
right
to
do
for
direct
contempt
in
his
presence
and
he
directed
the
prosecution
at
time
to
file
an
information
on
show
cause
order,
if
it
occurred
out
of
his
presence
or
out
of
his
hearing,
it
would
have
been
constructive
or
indirect
and
he
wouldn’t
had
have
to
start
the
day
maximum
stays
on.
he
could
got
six
months
for
example
and
i
liked
this
thing
you
mentioned
the
way
justice
harlan
did,
i
forgot
the
word
you
described
the
last
show
cause
order
of
a
hearing,
nothing
every
opportunity
was
given
to
this
man
and
his
counsel
to
file
some
sort
of
response
to
show
something
in
mitigation,
something
to
purge
himself,
nothing
was
ever
done.
as
true
as
he
noted
along
went
the
time
the
way
it
imposed
of
grounded
for
contempt
but
they
never
appeared
to
defend
themselves
and
i
don’t
like
judge
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
to
me,
it
gets
back.
i
don’t
know
what
the
aspects
the
usual
contempt
in
mississippi
is
unique,
and
i
didn’t
have
the
time
to
research
it
from
other
states
with
this
tremendous
task.
but
i
agree
thoroughly
with
the
rationale
of
mayberry
and
other
similar
cases
that
if
summary
punishment
is
not
immediately
imposed
at
that
judge
ought
to
get
some
other
judge
to
hear
the
thing.
hear
the
evidence
and
defend
on
whether
or
not,
first,
it
is
contempt
and
what
the
penalty
ought
to
be.
some
judges
are
unstrung
by
the
contemptuous
conduct
or
unbiased,
unprejudiced,
and
unattached.
but
i
suggest
this,
i
mean
i
have
been
through
the
court,
i
felt
it
like
a
sort
of
thin
ice
in
this
case
for
a
while
and
i
tried
to
get
counsel
to
agree,
in
spite
of
the
fact
i
think
rule
37,
being
find
on
submissive
through
that
argument.
i
tried
to
get
them
to
agree
to
submit
it.
but
instead
in
the
thing
and
the
statute
on
appeals
from
contempt
convictions,
i
found
an
interesting
thing
i've
pointed
out
in
my
virtual
brief
that
that
statute
accomplishes,
i
think
to
greater
degree
what
would
be
accomplished
by
having
one
single
judge
hear
this
thing
at
a
later
date
when
summary
punishment
not
imposed.
that
statute
on
appeal
from
contempt
conviction
provides
that
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
nine
judges
will
review
the
thing
on
a
record
and
decide
one.
was
there
a
contempt?
then,
if
they
determined
that
there
was
a
contempt
from
that
cold
printed
record
uninfluenced
by
courtroom
atmosphere
and
what
not
they
can
do
one
of
four
things.
at
the
time
when
the
statute
said,
whether
the
appellant
was
guilty
of
contempt
and
the
sentence
or
decree
or
order
of
the
court
below
maybe
affirmed,
reversed,
annulled
or
modified.
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court,
that
of
course
was
a
reason
i
have
attested
boston
opinion
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief,
to
show
just
how
our
state
supreme
court
has
handled
these
things.
now,
there
was
a
case
where
the
same
judge
perry
found
a
man
in
boston
who
was
a
lawyer
on
winston
county,
mississippi.
they
ran
against
judge
perry,
the
circuit
judge
in
contempt
and
they
appealed
to
their
supreme
court
and
they
completely
annulled
the
conviction.
they
didn’t
reverse,
remand,
vacate,
or
modify.
they
completely
annulled
it
as
you
see
from
that
appendix.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
they
mean
by
the
statement
mr.
justice,
as
i
understood
is
this,
that
they
had
to
accept
as
a
fact
from
the
finding
of
the
trial
court,
what
this
contemnor
did?
there
was
--
as
mr.
justice
marshall
asks
this,
there's
never
been
any
denial
of
the
fact
that
he
did
what
he
did.
then
under
this
appeal
statute,
they
will
determine
if
that
is
the
contempt
and
go
ahead
and
vacate,
reverse,
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
he
had
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
summarily,
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
my
recollection
is
that
there
at
least
two
of
these
show
cause
order
who
served
and
to
give
him
an
answer
or
opportunity
to
file
a
written
response.
i
forgot
which
justice
--
asking
for
written
response
as
required
in
mississippi
i
don’t
think
it
is.
but
that
any
contemnor
who
--
that
i
never
heard
of
who
desired
to
purge
himself
was
--
has
done
so,
for
having
anything
to
say
in
litigation
or
by
way
of
apology.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
word.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
what
date
was
that,
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but
had
not
he’d
been
previously
afforded
an
opportunity
to
file
a
response
in
earlier.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
part
of
mississippi
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
haven’t
seen
the
printed
record.
in
fact,
this
is
an
informal
corpus
appeal,
is
it
not?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
then,
i
think
the
original
record
was
up
there,
when
i
have
to
thank
sheriff
almeda.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
from
my
information
was
that
he
had
--
there
were
two
hearings
set
and
the
first
one,
he
didn’t
even
show
up.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
perhaps
on
second
one
but
it
is
there
on
the
second
one.
my
recollection
is
that
he
has
given
other
judge
to
hear
it
and
the
rather
make
any
defense
which
gets
back
to
the
proposition
that
if
judge
perry
heard
it,
took
testimony
and
actually
had
denial
of
whether
or
not
he
uttered
these
contemptuous
words
and
conduct
that
and
still
found
him
in
contempt,
then
under
these
various
statutory
statute
on
appeal
which
i
think
is
even
better
than
having
a
single
judge,
you
got
nine
supreme
court
judges
just
passionately
reviewing
the
thing
from
a
cold
printed
record
and
as
illustrated
by
this
boston
case
completely
annulling
the
contempt
conviction.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
can’t
answer
that
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
can’t
say
it
no.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
summary
contempt
which
would
bear
immediate
imposition
of
punishment.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but,
but
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
only
thing
in
the
printed
record
is
that
he
did
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
he
didn’t
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
then
the
record
show
that
he
had
one
previous
opportunity
to
appear
and
did
not
appear.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
what?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
judge
perry’s
statement.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
say
this
mr.
justice
white
that
when
the
conviction
was
appealed
on
the
state
supreme
court,
there
was
no
complaint
made
that
no
effort
made
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
that
you
have
a
written
record
here
that
based
on
that
ground
that
he
didn’t
have
a
chance
to
deny
that
he
did
this
thing.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
the
previous
opportunity.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
this
time?
what
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
my
po
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
don’t
think
supreme
court
of
mississippi
or
this
court
ought
to
say
it
except
for
anything
other
than
the
fact,
did
he
commit
this
act
which
is
gone
under
that
completely
and
no
complaints
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
we
accepted
the
fact
in
the
record
and
i
think
we
can
(inaudible)
deny
and
nobody’s
claiming
that
they
won’t
need
a
hearing
to
deny
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
--
to
deny
that
he
did
this
thing.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
that
was
--
that
was
after
the
first
show
cause
was
issued.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
all
i
can
say
your
honor
that
i
wouldn’t
have
done
a
thing.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
have
all
of
it
in
the
record
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
pursue
it
was
in
and
i
suppose
the
court
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i'm
sure
that
was
in
the
record
of
supreme
court
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
let
me
say
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well
in
mississippi,
you
can
get
it
two
ways
up.
you
take
the
bill
of
exceptions
and
someone
transpires
in
the
courtroom
which
is
not
taken
down
by
the
court
reporter.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
some
things
that
are
not
there
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
judge
--
prepare
the
bill
of
exceptions,
the
judge
if
he
agrees
that
those
are
transpired,
he
will
sign
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
if
he
refuses
to
sign
it,
you
can
get
two
members
of
the
bar
who
are
present
in
the
court
to
sign
it
and
then
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
bill
of
exception
that
for
what
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
still
get
back
to
the
proposition
if
the
court
please
that
since
this
was
a
direct
contempt
in
the
premises
of
the
court
which
i
must
accept
to
the
fact,
because
there
was
never
been
any
denial
or
they
have
attempted
to
deny
anything
and
any
document
that
was
filed
or
any
argument
that
was
made,
i
think
in
that
respect,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
could
accept
the
trial
judge’s
statement
as
to
what
transpired.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
simply
gets
back
to
this
and
how
can
this
man
complain
when
judge
perry
could
have
summarily
put
this
30
days
on
him
right
then
and
there.
but
he
gets
it
two
years
later
and
as
fully
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
how
can
he
complain?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
my
premise
is
this
mr.
justice
brennan
that
while
on
that
he
heard
it
and
he
said
he
heard
it
but
if
he
heard
it,
it
was
direct.
if
he
did
not
he
hear
it,
it
was
constructed.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
unless
he
said
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
have
contumacious
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
they
never.
i
can
only
get
back
this,
they
never
even
intimated
that
this
event
did
not
transpire.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
would
it
be
what,
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
understood
that.
from
my
understanding,
that’s
correct.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
was
remanded.
no
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
remove
the
first
one
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
why
not
defend
yourself,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
when
he
asked
such
a
complete
review
by
the
state
supreme
court
on
any
conviction
contempt
and
to
say
on
whether
that
type
of
statute
is
unique
in
mississippi
or
wide
spread
but
to
me
it’s
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
well,
i
think.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
now,
that’s
--
that’s
what
it
said.
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
as
i
say
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
all
have
a
different
ways
of
doing
things
and
i
think
if
this
have
been
transpired,
he
should
have
been
summarily
punished
but
i
still
i
think
he
was
better
off
when
given
an
opportunity.
and
with
the
sheriff,
the
judge
could’ve
said,
“mr.
sheriff,
take
this
man
outside
and
(inaudible)
contempt
take
him
up
to
the
jail.
he
didn’t
do
that,
he
gave
him
a
show
cause
hearing,
an
opportunity
and
he
didn’t
take
it
back.
then
he
removed
at
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
he
didn’t
say
it
that
first
show
cause
hearing
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
removed
it
at
the
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
nothing
because
this
petitioner
removed
the
thing
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
a
perfect
right
to
do
it
but
they
had
perfectly
proceeded
to
file
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
say
this
at
the
outset
that
judge
perry
is
an
old
friend
of
mine,
a
classmate
and
i've
known
him
for
years
and
he
has
his
way
of
doing
things
sometimes
rather
unpredictable
frankly.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
judge
that
imposed
this
sentence.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
grenada
county,
yes.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
same
judge
and
i
come
to
my
reason
for
making
that
opinion
(inaudible)
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
what
the
defendant
published
a
report
at
the
time,
this
brief
once
affirmed.
without
all
the
fly
outs
of
bias
and
prejudice
that
may
have
existed,
assuming
for
argument
on
in
front
judge
perry
towards
this
so-called
civil
rights
worker
or
whoever
he
might
be,
i
don’t
see
it
he’s
in
any
position
to
complain
of
the
procedures
that
was
used
against
him.
if
judge
perry
heard
those
contemptuous
remarks
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
he
said
he
did
in
the
petition
that
he
instructed
the
show
cause
petition
or
information
which
he
instructed
to
prosecute
it
to
prepare.
i
think
that’s
where
the
prosecutor
who
decided
and
who
prepared
it
said,
it
was
reported
to
judge
perry.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but
you’ll
find
in
the
record
that
judge
perry
himself
stated
that
he
heard
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
could
have
been
both
and
like
here
is
a
question
of
counsel.
but
i
might
add
this,
even
though,
the
punishment
was
not
summarily
imposed
which
he
had
a
right
to
do
for
direct
contempt
in
his
presence
and
he
directed
the
prosecution
at
time
to
file
an
information
on
show
cause
order,
if
it
occurred
out
of
his
presence
or
out
of
his
hearing,
it
would
have
been
constructive
or
indirect
and
he
wouldn’t
had
have
to
start
the
day
maximum
stays
on.
he
could
got
six
months
for
example
and
i
liked
this
thing
you
mentioned
the
way
justice
harlan
did,
i
forgot
the
word
you
described
the
last
show
cause
order
of
a
hearing,
nothing
every
opportunity
was
given
to
this
man
and
his
counsel
to
file
some
sort
of
response
to
show
something
in
mitigation,
something
to
purge
himself,
nothing
was
ever
done.
as
true
as
he
noted
along
went
the
time
the
way
it
imposed
of
grounded
for
contempt
but
they
never
appeared
to
defend
themselves
and
i
don’t
like
judge
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
to
me,
it
gets
back.
i
don’t
know
what
the
aspects
the
usual
contempt
in
mississippi
is
unique,
and
i
didn’t
have
the
time
to
research
it
from
other
states
with
this
tremendous
task.
but
i
agree
thoroughly
with
the
rationale
of
mayberry
and
other
similar
cases
that
if
summary
punishment
is
not
immediately
imposed
at
that
judge
ought
to
get
some
other
judge
to
hear
the
thing.
hear
the
evidence
and
defend
on
whether
or
not,
first,
it
is
contempt
and
what
the
penalty
ought
to
be.
some
judges
are
unstrung
by
the
contemptuous
conduct
or
unbiased,
unprejudiced,
and
unattached.
but
i
suggest
this,
i
mean
i
have
been
through
the
court,
i
felt
it
like
a
sort
of
thin
ice
in
this
case
for
a
while
and
i
tried
to
get
counsel
to
agree,
in
spite
of
the
fact
i
think
rule
37,
being
find
on
submissive
through
that
argument.
i
tried
to
get
them
to
agree
to
submit
it.
but
instead
in
the
thing
and
the
statute
on
appeals
from
contempt
convictions,
i
found
an
interesting
thing
i've
pointed
out
in
my
virtual
brief
that
that
statute
accomplishes,
i
think
to
greater
degree
what
would
be
accomplished
by
having
one
single
judge
hear
this
thing
at
a
later
date
when
summary
punishment
not
imposed.
that
statute
on
appeal
from
contempt
conviction
provides
that
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
nine
judges
will
review
the
thing
on
a
record
and
decide
one.
was
there
a
contempt?
then,
if
they
determined
that
there
was
a
contempt
from
that
cold
printed
record
uninfluenced
by
courtroom
atmosphere
and
what
not
they
can
do
one
of
four
things.
at
the
time
when
the
statute
said,
whether
the
appellant
was
guilty
of
contempt
and
the
sentence
or
decree
or
order
of
the
court
below
maybe
affirmed,
reversed,
annulled
or
modified.
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court,
that
of
course
was
a
reason
i
have
attested
boston
opinion
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief,
to
show
just
how
our
state
supreme
court
has
handled
these
things.
now,
there
was
a
case
where
the
same
judge
perry
found
a
man
in
boston
who
was
a
lawyer
on
winston
county,
mississippi.
they
ran
against
judge
perry,
the
circuit
judge
in
contempt
and
they
appealed
to
their
supreme
court
and
they
completely
annulled
the
conviction.
they
didn’t
reverse,
remand,
vacate,
or
modify.
they
completely
annulled
it
as
you
see
from
that
appendix.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
they
mean
by
the
statement
mr.
justice,
as
i
understood
is
this,
that
they
had
to
accept
as
a
fact
from
the
finding
of
the
trial
court,
what
this
contemnor
did?
there
was
--
as
mr.
justice
marshall
asks
this,
there's
never
been
any
denial
of
the
fact
that
he
did
what
he
did.
then
under
this
appeal
statute,
they
will
determine
if
that
is
the
contempt
and
go
ahead
and
vacate,
reverse,
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
he
had
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
summarily,
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
my
recollection
is
that
there
at
least
two
of
these
show
cause
order
who
served
and
to
give
him
an
answer
or
opportunity
to
file
a
written
response.
i
forgot
which
justice
--
asking
for
written
response
as
required
in
mississippi
i
don’t
think
it
is.
but
that
any
contemnor
who
--
that
i
never
heard
of
who
desired
to
purge
himself
was
--
has
done
so,
for
having
anything
to
say
in
litigation
or
by
way
of
apology.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
word.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
what
date
was
that,
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but
had
not
he’d
been
previously
afforded
an
opportunity
to
file
a
response
in
earlier.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
part
of
mississippi
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
haven’t
seen
the
printed
record.
in
fact,
this
is
an
informal
corpus
appeal,
is
it
not?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
then,
i
think
the
original
record
was
up
there,
when
i
have
to
thank
sheriff
almeda.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
from
my
information
was
that
he
had
--
there
were
two
hearings
set
and
the
first
one,
he
didn’t
even
show
up.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
perhaps
on
second
one
but
it
is
there
on
the
second
one.
my
recollection
is
that
he
has
given
other
judge
to
hear
it
and
the
rather
make
any
defense
which
gets
back
to
the
proposition
that
if
judge
perry
heard
it,
took
testimony
and
actually
had
denial
of
whether
or
not
he
uttered
these
contemptuous
words
and
conduct
that
and
still
found
him
in
contempt,
then
under
these
various
statutory
statute
on
appeal
which
i
think
is
even
better
than
having
a
single
judge,
you
got
nine
supreme
court
judges
just
passionately
reviewing
the
thing
from
a
cold
printed
record
and
as
illustrated
by
this
boston
case
completely
annulling
the
contempt
conviction.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
can’t
answer
that
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
can’t
say
it
no.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
summary
contempt
which
would
bear
immediate
imposition
of
punishment.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but,
but
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
only
thing
in
the
printed
record
is
that
he
did
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
he
didn’t
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
then
the
record
show
that
he
had
one
previous
opportunity
to
appear
and
did
not
appear.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
what?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
judge
perry’s
statement.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
say
this
mr.
justice
white
that
when
the
conviction
was
appealed
on
the
state
supreme
court,
there
was
no
complaint
made
that
no
effort
made
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
that
you
have
a
written
record
here
that
based
on
that
ground
that
he
didn’t
have
a
chance
to
deny
that
he
did
this
thing.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
the
previous
opportunity.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
this
time?
what
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
my
po
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
don’t
think
supreme
court
of
mississippi
or
this
court
ought
to
say
it
except
for
anything
other
than
the
fact,
did
he
commit
this
act
which
is
gone
under
that
completely
and
no
complaints
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
we
accepted
the
fact
in
the
record
and
i
think
we
can
(inaudible)
deny
and
nobody’s
claiming
that
they
won’t
need
a
hearing
to
deny
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
--
to
deny
that
he
did
this
thing.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
that
was
--
that
was
after
the
first
show
cause
was
issued.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
all
i
can
say
your
honor
that
i
wouldn’t
have
done
a
thing.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
have
all
of
it
in
the
record
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
pursue
it
was
in
and
i
suppose
the
court
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i'm
sure
that
was
in
the
record
of
supreme
court
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
let
me
say
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well
in
mississippi,
you
can
get
it
two
ways
up.
you
take
the
bill
of
exceptions
and
someone
transpires
in
the
courtroom
which
is
not
taken
down
by
the
court
reporter.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
some
things
that
are
not
there
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
judge
--
prepare
the
bill
of
exceptions,
the
judge
if
he
agrees
that
those
are
transpired,
he
will
sign
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
if
he
refuses
to
sign
it,
you
can
get
two
members
of
the
bar
who
are
present
in
the
court
to
sign
it
and
then
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
bill
of
exception
that
for
what
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
still
get
back
to
the
proposition
if
the
court
please
that
since
this
was
a
direct
contempt
in
the
premises
of
the
court
which
i
must
accept
to
the
fact,
because
there
was
never
been
any
denial
or
they
have
attempted
to
deny
anything
and
any
document
that
was
filed
or
any
argument
that
was
made,
i
think
in
that
respect,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
could
accept
the
trial
judge’s
statement
as
to
what
transpired.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
simply
gets
back
to
this
and
how
can
this
man
complain
when
judge
perry
could
have
summarily
put
this
30
days
on
him
right
then
and
there.
but
he
gets
it
two
years
later
and
as
fully
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
how
can
he
complain?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
my
premise
is
this
mr.
justice
brennan
that
while
on
that
he
heard
it
and
he
said
he
heard
it
but
if
he
heard
it,
it
was
direct.
if
he
did
not
he
hear
it,
it
was
constructed.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
unless
he
said
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
have
contumacious
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
they
never.
i
can
only
get
back
this,
they
never
even
intimated
that
this
event
did
not
transpire.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
would
it
be
what,
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
understood
that.
from
my
understanding,
that’s
correct.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
was
remanded.
no
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
remove
the
first
one
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
why
not
defend
yourself,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
when
he
asked
such
a
complete
review
by
the
state
supreme
court
on
any
conviction
contempt
and
to
say
on
whether
that
type
of
statute
is
unique
in
mississippi
or
wide
spread
but
to
me
it’s
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes.
well,
i
think.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
now,
that’s
--
that’s
what
it
said.
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
as
i
say
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
all
have
a
different
ways
of
doing
things
and
i
think
if
this
have
been
transpired,
he
should
have
been
summarily
punished
but
i
still
i
think
he
was
better
off
when
given
an
opportunity.
and
with
the
sheriff,
the
judge
could’ve
said,
“mr.
sheriff,
take
this
man
outside
and
(inaudible)
contempt
take
him
up
to
the
jail.
he
didn’t
do
that,
he
gave
him
a
show
cause
hearing,
an
opportunity
and
he
didn’t
take
it
back.
then
he
removed
at
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
he
didn’t
say
it
that
first
show
cause
hearing
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
removed
it
at
the
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
nothing
because
this
petitioner
removed
the
thing
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
a
perfect
right
to
do
it
but
they
had
perfectly
proceeded
to
file
in
the
state
courts.
