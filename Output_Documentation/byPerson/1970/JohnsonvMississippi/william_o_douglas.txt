mr.
porter,
you
were
not
counsel
for
johnson
at
the
time
of
this
incident,
were
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
i
correctly
infer
that
the
attorney,
which
he
had
at
that
time,
was
also
cited
for
contempt?
justice
william

douglas
and
with
what
result?
justice
william

who’s
this?
the
judge

mr.
lyell.
justice

douglas
as
i

mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to.
these
are
the
proceedings
and
so
it’s
stated
here
before
judge
perry
at
nine
o’clock
in
january
27,
1969,
here,
it’s
cited
that
martha
m.
wood
requested
a
hearing.
her
request
was
denied.
she
then
objected
to
the
denial
and
this
appears,
judge
perry
stated
that
he
had
intended
to
give
respondent
a
hearing
under
the
contempt
charge
as
the
court
files
ordering
him
to
appear
in
a
show
cause
proof.
but
that
since
respondent
had
the
audacity
to
go
to
federal
court,
and
whether
judge
perry
meant
by
that
the
original
removal
order
or
the
affirmative
jury
suit
or
both
is
not
clear,
he
was
not
going
to
give
him
a
hearing?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
can’t
say
whether
that
did
or
did
not
occur?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
simply
say
mr.
lyell.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
appears
here.
well,
from
this
it
appears
that
he
didn’t.
so,
we
don’t
know
whether
had
he
have
a
hearing?
perhaps
to
take
in
the
stand
and
had
denied
that
stayed?
