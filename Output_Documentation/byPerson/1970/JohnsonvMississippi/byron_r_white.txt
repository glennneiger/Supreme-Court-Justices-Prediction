white
well,
this
judge
indicated
later,
he
heard
it
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
don’t
know
that
is
inconsistent
with
his
having
heard
it
and
i
wouldn’t
think
it’s
inconsistent
with
his
having
heard
it
that
the
sheriff
brought
the
man
up
to
him
and
told
him
what
he
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
perhaps
didn’t
say,
“well,
i
have
heard
it
by
myself
so
you
don’t
need
to
tell
me.”
but
he
let
him
tell
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn’t
be
improper
for
the
direct
one,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wasn’t
it
heard?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
he
issued
another
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
respond
writing
to
the
show
cause
order
in
that
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
response
from
the
person’s
show
cause
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
it?
there
was
then
any
suit
filed
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn’t
a
major
part
of
mayberry
though
that
the
judge
who
is
going
to
later
hear
the
case
had
himself
then
slandered
and
insulted
personally,
and
hence,
there
might
have
been
some
question
about
his
fairness?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
you
rely
on
this
case
to
suggest
that
the
judge
trying
this
contempt
later
might
have
had
a
personal
animus
and
would
be
biased?
justice
byron
r.
white
based
on
what?
base
on
what
note?
i
mean,
just
generalized
allegations
would
suffice
every
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
charge?
what
was
the
charge
in
the
suit
against
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
petitioner?
i
mean,
was
the
petitioner,
a
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
he
wasn’t
suing
him
for
anything
that
the
judge
did
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
doing
that
brings
this
case
within
mayberry?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
determination
that
he
ever
said
it
is
by
judge
--
justice
byron
r.
white
who,
perhaps,
arguably
at
least
shouldn’t
have
heard
it
at
all?
