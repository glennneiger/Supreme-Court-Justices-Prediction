mr.
stephen
w.
porter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
stephen
porter
of
the
law
firm
williams
&
connolly,
seated
in
counsel
table
is
richard
rugo
of
the
law
firm
hogan
&
hartson.
we
are
co-counsel
for
petitioner
in
this
matter.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
conviction
and
sentencing
of
a
mississippi
civil
rights
worker
under
circumstances
which
would
appear
to
ignore
every
pronouncement
and
every
limitation
and
every
cautionary
statement
that
this
court
has
over
the
years
ever
made
on
the
issue
of
the
use
by
a
trial
court
of
the
power,
without
the
ordinary
requirements
of
due
process
to
punish
allegedly
contumacious
behavior
summarily.
the
salient
facts
briefly
reviewed
are
as
follows.
on
january
27,
1969,
petitioner
robert
johnson
was
summarily
convicted
by
grenada
county,
mississippi
circuit
court
judge
marshall
perry
for
a
remarked
allegedly
made
in
judge
perry’s
court
more
than
two
years
earlier.
judge
perry
sentenced
petitioner
for
four
months
in
jail
although
the
maximum
sentence
is
one
month
to
which
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
later
reduced
the
sentence.
the
conviction
resulted
from
an
incident
which
occurred
on
january
24,
1967
in
the
judge’s
courtroom.
at
9
a.m.
that
morning,
prospective
jurors
of
the
january
term
occupied
benches
near
courtroom
doors,
a
section
normally
reserved
for
the
public.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
this
one
month
sentence
has
been
stayed.
the
most
direct
route
to
seats
reserved
for
defendants
in
pending
cases
before
the
term
involved
walking
in
front
of
these
jurors.
judge
perry
announced
that
anyone
entering
the
court
while
in
session
would
be
required
to
use
an
aisle
in
the
rear
and
this
announcement
was
made
approximately
five
or
ten
minutes
before
robert
johnson
appeared
in
court.
when
petitioner
johnson
arrived,
he
walked
via
the
most
direct
route
to
the
seats
reserved
for
the
prospective
defendants
and
as
he
did
he
walked
in
front
of
the
jurors.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor
whether
or
not
he
was
going
to
be
tried
that
day.
it
was
the
opening
day
of
the
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
--
of
this
term.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
and
he
was
required
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
petitioner
johnson
was
apprehended
by
the
deputy
sheriff
who
ordered
him
to
walk
around
to
the
rear.
this
point,
according
to
the
state’s
show
cause
petition,
johnson
there
upon
said
in
a
loud
and
offensive
voice,
“what
the
hell
do
you
mean,
go
around
to
the
rear?”
that
is
the
sum
total
of
any
allegation
of
contumacious
behavior
on
petitioner’s
part.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
far
different
matter
than
what
he
did
do
and
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
and
i
think
even
then,
the
behavior
of
petitioner
johnson
who
was
alleged
is
far
less
than
the
outrageous
behavior
which
is
present
in
many
of
the
decided
cases
to
this
court
on
this
subject.
furthermore,
i
think
there's
another
issue
which
ought
be
raised
and
faced,
and
determined,
that
is
the
question
of
whether
a
judge
ought
involved
a
summary
contempt
power
against
a
person
who
is
not
then
involved
in
a
proceeding
before
the
court
or
whether
or
not
the
ordinary
fuller
hearing
ought
be
required.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
there
are
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
leaving
aside
the
question
of
a
lawyer
for
the
moment.
i
think
the
difference
is
this,
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
defendant
before
the
court,
it
is
possible
--
it’s
much
more
difficult
to
invoke
a
summary
punishment
because
it
involves
the
possibility
of
prejudicing
the
case,
possibly
prejudicing
the
jury,
and
possibly
interrupting
the
proceedings.
there
is
a
lesser
remedy
available
in
respect
of
a
spectator.
he
can
be
removed
from
the
court.
the
court
can
proceed
with
its
business
and
still
take
care
of
in
due
course
charging
the
contemnor
with
the
responsibility
for
his
act.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
the
judge
was
on
the
bench.
although,
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
record
does
not
show
what
was
going
on
whether
or
not
if
it
was
going
on
--
it
appears
the
petitioner
arrived
in
court
shortly
after
the
judge
was
making
his
opening
announcements
with
respect
to
a
--
i
don’t
believe
it,
a
trial
was
going
on
because
i
don’t
think
jurors
had
been
chosen
yet,
with
respect
to
any
of
the
pending
cases.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
it’s
a
preliminary
matter
--
i
believe
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
don’t
question
your
honor,
the
power
of
the
court
to
deal
with
an
utterance
of
that
kind
in
a
courtroom.
although,
i
think
traditionally,
it
would
have
to
have
been
the
kind
of
behavior
which
would
have
disrupted
the
proceedings.
the
state’s
show
cause
petition
alleges
that
the
chair
from
his
deputy
brought
petitioner
before
the
judge
and
related
to
the
judge
what
had
happened,
indicating
that
the
judge
had
never
heard
the
disruption
which
had
taken
place.
and
again,
i
think
that
although
the
court
that
has
the
power
to
dispose
off
a
disruption
in
the
court,
questions
of
whether
or
not,
it
should
deal
with
it
in
a
summary
proceeding,
where
some
other
method
would
be
appropriate
and
still
reserving
the
possibility
of
a
prosecution
for
contemptuous
behavior
is
a
reasonable
and
proper
result.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
the
judge
cannot
do
anything
about
it,
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
there's
several
things
he
could
do
and
it
depends,
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
he
could
probably
put
him
in
jail
for
30
days
right
then
and
there.
although,--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor,
legally.
he
could
put
him
in
jail
for
30
days
right
then
and
there,
if
the
judge
saw
and
heard
the
--
this
is
the
old
distinction
between
direct
and
indirect
contempts.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
that’s
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
there
is
a
state
statute
that
covers
contempt
of
--
direct
contempt
of
court
punishable
by
one
month.
it
empowers
the
judge
to
sentence
a
contemnor
to
one
month
in
jail
in
a
direct
contempt
under
mississippi
statute.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
this
charge
later
indicated
the,
your
honor,
two
years
--
after
two
years
had
gone
by
that
he
did
hear
it
himself.
although,
he
had
in
the
intervening
of
time
schedule
a
show
cause
hearing.
twice
scheduled
a
show
cause
hearing
and
then
he
canceled
it.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
your
honor,
i
think
it
may
begin
inconsistent
in
this
respect
and
that
is
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
and
then
he
scheduled
a
show
cause
hearing
and
which
would
be
the
proper
procedure
under
mississippi
statute
for
an
indirect
contempt.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
it
would
not
be
improper
to
provide
a
fuller
hearing,
that’s
correct.
the
judge
ordered
the
show
cause
hearing
--
a
show
cause
petition
be
filed
and
within
the
two
days
of
the
such
order,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
that
judge
perry
disqualify
himself
from
the
pending
show
cause
hearing
alleging
personal
prejudice
and
further
alleging
that
since
the
judge
had
ordered
his
arrest,
he
could
not
fairly
decide
the
action.
on
february
1,
1967,
approximately
a
week
after
these
events,
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
removal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi.
it
was
not
until
some
21
1/2
months
that
elapsed
that
the
united
states
district
court
remanded
the
prosecution
to
the
grenada
county
circuit
court
holding
that
petitioner’s
remedy
in
the
federal
system
could
lie
only
after
he
demonstrated
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights
by
the
state
courts.
on
january
22,
1969,
prior
to
any
action
in
grenada
county
on
the
contempt
charge
and
two
months
after,
the
federal
court
had
returned
the
prosecution
to
the
state
system.
petitioner
and
others
filed
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
wholly
separate
action
to
restrain
trials
of
negroes
and
women
until
such
time
as
those
persons
were
not
systematically
excluded
from
juries
in
violation
of
the
u.s.
constitution.
judge
perry
was
named
as
one
of
the
defendants
in
that
action
and
served
with
the
process
on
january
23,
1969.
on
january
24,
1969,
a
summons
was
issued
directing
johnson
to
appear
in
judge
perry’s
courtroom
on
january
27th,
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
punished
on
the
old
contempt
charge.
on
january
27th,
petitioner
and
his
attorney
did
appear
in
front
of
judge
perry
for
the
show
cause
hearing
at
which
time
the
judge
canceled
the
hearing
instead
reading
a
contempt
conviction
sentencing
petitioner
to
four
months
in
jail.
bail
was
set
at
$2,000.00
and
subsequently
reduced
to
the
statutory
maximum
of
$300.00
for
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
later
that
same
morning
at
the
second
appearance
before
judge
perry,
in
an
effort
to
obtain
the
judge’s
signature
on
a
bill
of
exceptions,
the
judge
refused.
and
when
the
petitioner’s
attorney
prepared
the
bill
of
exceptions,
the
judge
summarily,
and
charged
hearing
contempt,
a
conviction
which
was
later
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
you
mean,
why
didn’t
punish
him
in
1967?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
record
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
record
does
not
show
why
he
didn’t.
the
record
only
shows
that
he
just
elected
to
travel
the
show
cause
route
rather
than
to
invoke
such
summary
powers
as
he
might
had
have
under
the
mississippi
statute.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
order
to
show
cause
was
returnable
on
february
1st,
i
think,
nine
days
after
the
alleged
contumacious
behavior.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
issued
almost
immediately
following
the
judge’s
order
that
a
show
cause
order
be
issued.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
why
was
it
not
heard
immediately?
the
judge
ordered
that
--
i
believe
the
judge
ordered
that
the
show
cause
petition
be
issued
within
48
hours
and
why
he
didn’t
set
it
down
for
an
earlier
hearing
is
just
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
second
one
was
two
years
later.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
february
1st
show
cause
hearing
was
not
held
because
by
that
time
a
removal
petition
had
been
filed
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
or
the
doer,
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
the
only
response
was
a
motion
filed
that
judge
perry
recused
himself
from
hearing
the
matter
and
that
motion
was
never
heard
and
never
determined
by
the
judge.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
there
was
then
a
suit
filed
against
judge
perry
that
was
after
21-and-a-half
months
had
elapsed
and
after
the
federal
system
had
returned
the
case
to
the
grenada
county
circuit
court.
about
two
months
after
the
case
had
been
returned
and
still
without
any
action
taken
in
grenada
county,
the
separate
suit
was
filed
by
petitioner
naming
judge
perry
as
the
defendant.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
you
mean
your
honor,
the
proceeding
that
was
going
on
in
the
courtroom?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
don’t
believe
there
was
any
proceeding
going
on
at
that
time.
i
believe
they
were
in
a
process
of
choosing
jurors
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
believe
they
were
selecting
jurors,
eligible
jurors,
for
all
the
pending
cases
in
that
term.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
the
record
suggests
none.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
just
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
reason
appears
to
have
been
the
request
by
the
deputy
sheriff
that
petitioner
walk
around
the
rear
of
the
room
when
he
take
his
seat
rather
than
take
the
more
direct
route
and
pass
in
front
of
the
prospective
jurors.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
he
was
scheduled
for
trial
during
that
term.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
believe
it
was
a
--
although,
it
is
not
indicated
in
the
record.
i
believe
it
was
a
trespass
case
which
was,
although,
there
wasn’t
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
don’t
know
what
it
was,
your
honor.
it’s
not
in
the
record
and
the
only
thing
that
is
in
the
record
which
we
have
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
is
that
the
--
there
was
never
any
prosecution
on
the
matter.
the
prosecution
on
the
substantive
charge
against
petitioner
was
dropped.
i
believe
it
was
a
trespass
arriving
out
of
a
civil
rights
demonstration.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i've
no
idea
your
honor.
it’s
not
in
the
record.
from
its
earliest
decisions,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
use
of
summary
procedures
to
convict
must
be
carefully
controlled
since
they
do
not
encompass
the
ordinary
procedural
safeguards
incorporated
in
our
system
of
justice,
the
right
of
an
accused
to
be
apprised
fully
of
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him,
the
right
to
put
on
defense,
the
right
to
counsel.
generally,
the
merrill
area
within
which
summary
contempt
proceedings
have
been
permitted
is
where
the
trial
judge
has
observed
the
contumacious
conduct
and
then
acts
swiftly
by
conviction
of
the
contemnor
rather
than
by
an
alternative
remedy
in
order
to
quell
a
disturbance
threatening
to
upset
the
sanctity
of
the
courtroom.
other
remedies
have
been
held
constitutionally
permissible
in
dealing
with
an
obstreperous
defendant.
this
court
recently
in
illinois
v.
allen
mentioned
at
least
two
others
restraint
and
removal
from
the
courtroom.
other
non-summary
conviction
procedures
suggests
themselves,
contempt
procedures
suggests
themselves
were
appropriate
such
as
a
civil
contempt.
a
postponement
of
the
proceedings
in
a
proper
case
or
by
the
judge,
informing
the
defendant
that
charges
will
be
preferred
against
him
for
contempt
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
refer
to
another
judge.
in
light
of
these
other
possible
remedies
and
in
light
of
these
court’s
recent
holding
in
mayberry
versus
pennsylvania
which
we
stripped
to
the
use
of
a
summary
conviction
after
a
trial’s
conclusion.
since
at
that
time,
immediate
restoration
of
order
is
no
--
or
vindication
of
the
authority
of
the
court
is
no
longer
the
primary
requisite.
petitioner’s
conviction
and
its
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
must
be
reversed
for
the
follow
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
--
that
is
also
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
there
are
several
possible
alternatives
which
suggest
themselves
your
honor.
there’s
several
affidavits
in
the
records
suggesting
the
judge’s
personal
bias
against
defendant
and
its
members
of
his
race
and
civil
rights
workers
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes.
and
also
allegations
of
prejudice
or
part
of
the
possibility
of
prejudice
as
a
result
of
a
lawsuit
filed
by
petitioner
naming
the
judges
or
defendant
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
at
the
time
of
the
second
show
cause
hearing.
that
might
--
i
would
suggest
might
even
be
a
greater
possibility
of
bias
than
most
present
in
the
exchange
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
the
suit
your
honor
against
the
judge
was
against
the
judge
and
several
others
for
systemically
restraining
and
preventing
negroes
and
laymen
from
serving
on
juries
in
grenada
county,
mississippi.

the
petitioner
was

no,
your
honor.
other
than
as
a
member
of
class.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
i
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
both
attorneys
that
he
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
both,
the
first
attorney
who
represented
him
the
day
of
the
alleged
contumacious
behavior
was
cited
for
contempt
for
protesting
in
judge
perry’s
court
that
the
show
cause
hearing
was
improper
and
that
trial
was
restrained
by
a
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
and
the
case
had
never
--
was
just
never
just
brought
to
trial
after
the
temporary
retraining
order
expired.
his
second
attorney,
the
attorney
who
represented
him
at
the
time
of
the
second
show
cause
hearing
or
the
time
the
second
show
cause
hearing
was
scheduled
was
also
cited
for
contempt
and
that
contempt
conviction,
that
summary
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
direct
contempt
before
the
judge
and
that
the
summary
procedure
did
not
apply.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
your
honor,
if
were
--
if
it
were
not
a
direct
contempt,
the
summary
procedure
would
not
be.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
he
did
not.
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
the
summary
procedure
would
be
then.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
it
would
not
be
the
correct
procedure
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
show
cause
procedure,
no
sir.
no
quarrel
with
the
procedure
that
was
scheduled.
we
are
alleging
that
the
failure
to
then
hold
the
show
cause
hearing
or
to
hear
the
motion
that
the
judge
recused
himself
and
that
the
show
cause
hearing
be
before
an
unbiased
judge
was
improper.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor.
i
don’t
suggest
that.
i
don’t
think
that
there's
any
suggestion
here
that
this
lawsuit
was
brought
to
divest
the
judge
of
his
power
to
hear
the
contempt
charge.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
a
major
factor
and
i
--
but
i
think
that
if
--
i
think
when
you
have
an
elapse
of
two
years
time,
you
have
your
petitioner
who
is
a
civil
rights
worker,
who
is
working
actively
in
that
field,
when
he
brings
a
lawsuit
which
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
i
think,
if
you
have
an
intervening
legitimate
lawsuit
with
merits
which
is
not
brought
simply
to
divest
--
some
charge
in
order
to
divest
the
judge
of
his
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
contempt
charge,
i
think
you
have
an
intervening
factor
which
simply
requires
the
judge
to
excuse
himself.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
that
lawsuit
--
according
to
the
record
was
won
by
petitioner
of
the
federal
district
court,
issued
an
order
enjoining
the
judge
and
the
other
defendants
from
any
further
acts
which
would
violate
the
civil
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
class.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
order,
your
honor,
was
issued
and
judge
perry
and
others
were
enjoined
prior
to
the
time
that
the
judge
canceled
the
show
cause
hearing.
in
other
words,
the
suit
was
filed
within
the
matter
of
48
or
72
hours.
the
united
states
district
court
issued
its
injunction.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor.
i
would
not.
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
something
far
different
has
happened
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
something
far
different
has
happened
here.
there
was
no
finding
of
contempt
by
the
judge.
first
of
all,
it’s
not
clear
that
this
was
a
proper
case
in
which
there
could
be
a
finding
of
contempt
by
the
judge
without
a
hearing.
secondly,
even
if
this
were
the
case,
that
power
was
not
invoked
by
the
judge.
he
did
not
specifically
find
petitioner
in
contempt.
he
instead
ordered
a
show
cause
hearing.
he
ordered
two
show
cause
hearings
and
he
later
canceled
those
hearings.
and
we’re
suggesting
that
once
the
judge
has
elected
to
use
another
procedure,
unless
there
is
intervening
obstreperous
behavior,
there
may
not
be
a
cancellation
of
the
due
process
hearing
and
a
return
to
the
summary
procedure
because
at
that
point,
two
years
down
the
road
or
30
days
or
even
one
day
down
the
road,
there's
no
longer
any
need
to
call
the
disorder
in
the
courtroom
that
summary
procedure
has
historically
been
reserved
for
just
that
purpose,
to
quell
a
disruption
and
if
the
judge
elects
not
utilize
it
for
the
purpose
of
quelling
the
disruption,
he
ought
not
have
it
later.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor,
i
think
there
were
no
issues
of
fact
tendered.
the
petitioner
pointer
out
or
petitioner
appeared
for
the
show
cause
hearing
and
asked
through
his
attorney
to
put
on
a
defense
and
was
--
and
that
request
was
denied
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
which
is
in
the
record.
the
petitioner’s
attorney
states
that
she
was
prepared
to
present
evidence
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
did
not
behave
contumaciously.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
sir.
the
power
to
punish
summarily
in
any
event
if
this
court
is
to
permit
its
limited
--
in
limited
instances
its
continued
use,
should
only
be
sanctioned
or
all
else
is
proved
unavailing.
otherwise,
the
defendant
stands
confronted
with
the
conviction,
never
having
had
a
chance
to
assert
a
defense
but
the
only
protection
remaining
between
him
and
the
jailhouse
door
an
appeal
in
which
the
record
is
often
scanty
at
best
and
non-existent
at
worst.
such
an
appeal
even
if
ultimately
successful,
might
be
long
arduous
and
expensive
and
might
have
been
completely
avoided
if
all
the
facts
had
been
examined
in
unbiased
fashion
at
the
trial
level.
in
summary,
we
have
before
us
and
i
think
is
an
outrageous
case
which
amply
demonstrates
the
perils
of
the
misuse
of
the
power
to
punish
summarily.

there
is
wholly

from
the

in

the

mr.
stephen

immediately,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
rather
than
a
--
rather
than
a
sentence
of
four
months?
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
make
the
same
argument.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
it
is
the
process.
the
penalty
has
already
been
reduced
to
fit
to
the
statutory
maximum
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
mr.
stephen
w.

to
the

perry’s
sentence
exceeded
the
statutory
maximum
and
it
was
reduced
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
to
the
statutory
maximum
of
30
days.
mr.
stephen

no,
your

richard
rugo
of
the
law
firm
hogan
&
hartson.
we
are
co-counsel
for
petitioner
in
this
matter.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
conviction
and
sentencing
of
a
mississippi
civil
rights
worker
under
circumstances
which
would
appear
to
ignore
every
pronouncement
and
every
limitation
and
every
cautionary
statement
that
this
court
has
over
the
years
ever
made
on
the
issue
of
the
use
by
a
trial
court
of
the
power,
without
the
ordinary
requirements
of
due
process
to
punish
allegedly
contumacious
behavior
summarily.
the
salient
facts
briefly
reviewed
are
as
follows.
on
january
27,
1969,
petitioner
robert
johnson
was
summarily
convicted
by
grenada
county,
mississippi
circuit
court
judge
marshall
perry
for
a
remarked
allegedly
made
in
judge
perry’s
court
more
than
two
years
earlier.
judge
perry
sentenced
petitioner
for
four
months
in
jail
although
the
maximum
sentence
is
one
month
to
which
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
later
reduced
the
sentence.
the
conviction
resulted
from
an
incident
which
occurred
on
january
24,
1967
in
the
judge’s
courtroom.
at
9
a.m.
that
morning,
prospective
jurors
of
the
january
term
occupied
benches
near
courtroom
doors,
a
section
normally
reserved
for
the
public.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
this
one
month
sentence
has
been
stayed.
the
most
direct
route
to
seats
reserved
for
defendants
in
pending
cases
before
the
term
involved
walking
in
front
of
these
jurors.
judge
perry
announced
that
anyone
entering
the
court
while
in
session
would
be
required
to
use
an
aisle
in
the
rear
and
this
announcement
was
made
approximately
five
or
ten
minutes
before
robert
johnson
appeared
in
court.
when
petitioner
johnson
arrived,
he
walked
via
the
most
direct
route
to
the
seats
reserved
for
the
prospective
defendants
and
as
he
did
he
walked
in
front
of
the
jurors.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor
whether
or
not
he
was
going
to
be
tried
that
day.
it
was
the
opening
day
of
the
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
--
of
this
term.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
and
he
was
required
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
petitioner
johnson
was
apprehended
by
the
deputy
sheriff
who
ordered
him
to
walk
around
to
the
rear.
this
point,
according
to
the
state’s
show
cause
petition,
johnson
there
upon
said
in
a
loud
and
offensive
voice,
“what
the
hell
do
you
mean,
go
around
to
the
rear?”
that
is
the
sum
total
of
any
allegation
of
contumacious
behavior
on
petitioner’s
part.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
far
different
matter
than
what
he
did
do
and
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
and
i
think
even
then,
the
behavior
of
petitioner
johnson
who
was
alleged
is
far
less
than
the
outrageous
behavior
which
is
present
in
many
of
the
decided
cases
to
this
court
on
this
subject.
furthermore,
i
think
there's
another
issue
which
ought
be
raised
and
faced,
and
determined,
that
is
the
question
of
whether
a
judge
ought
involved
a
summary
contempt
power
against
a
person
who
is
not
then
involved
in
a
proceeding
before
the
court
or
whether
or
not
the
ordinary
fuller
hearing
ought
be
required.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
there
are
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
leaving
aside
the
question
of
a
lawyer
for
the
moment.
i
think
the
difference
is
this,
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
defendant
before
the
court,
it
is
possible
--
it’s
much
more
difficult
to
invoke
a
summary
punishment
because
it
involves
the
possibility
of
prejudicing
the
case,
possibly
prejudicing
the
jury,
and
possibly
interrupting
the
proceedings.
there
is
a
lesser
remedy
available
in
respect
of
a
spectator.
he
can
be
removed
from
the
court.
the
court
can
proceed
with
its
business
and
still
take
care
of
in
due
course
charging
the
contemnor
with
the
responsibility
for
his
act.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
the
judge
was
on
the
bench.
although,
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
record
does
not
show
what
was
going
on
whether
or
not
if
it
was
going
on
--
it
appears
the
petitioner
arrived
in
court
shortly
after
the
judge
was
making
his
opening
announcements
with
respect
to
a
--
i
don’t
believe
it,
a
trial
was
going
on
because
i
don’t
think
jurors
had
been
chosen
yet,
with
respect
to
any
of
the
pending
cases.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
it’s
a
preliminary
matter
--
i
believe
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
don’t
question
your
honor,
the
power
of
the
court
to
deal
with
an
utterance
of
that
kind
in
a
courtroom.
although,
i
think
traditionally,
it
would
have
to
have
been
the
kind
of
behavior
which
would
have
disrupted
the
proceedings.
the
state’s
show
cause
petition
alleges
that
the
chair
from
his
deputy
brought
petitioner
before
the
judge
and
related
to
the
judge
what
had
happened,
indicating
that
the
judge
had
never
heard
the
disruption
which
had
taken
place.
and
again,
i
think
that
although
the
court
that
has
the
power
to
dispose
off
a
disruption
in
the
court,
questions
of
whether
or
not,
it
should
deal
with
it
in
a
summary
proceeding,
where
some
other
method
would
be
appropriate
and
still
reserving
the
possibility
of
a
prosecution
for
contemptuous
behavior
is
a
reasonable
and
proper
result.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
the
judge
cannot
do
anything
about
it,
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
there's
several
things
he
could
do
and
it
depends,
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
he
could
probably
put
him
in
jail
for
30
days
right
then
and
there.
although,--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor,
legally.
he
could
put
him
in
jail
for
30
days
right
then
and
there,
if
the
judge
saw
and
heard
the
--
this
is
the
old
distinction
between
direct
and
indirect
contempts.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
that’s
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
there
is
a
state
statute
that
covers
contempt
of
--
direct
contempt
of
court
punishable
by
one
month.
it
empowers
the
judge
to
sentence
a
contemnor
to
one
month
in
jail
in
a
direct
contempt
under
mississippi
statute.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
this
charge
later
indicated
the,
your
honor,
two
years
--
after
two
years
had
gone
by
that
he
did
hear
it
himself.
although,
he
had
in
the
intervening
of
time
schedule
a
show
cause
hearing.
twice
scheduled
a
show
cause
hearing
and
then
he
canceled
it.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
your
honor,
i
think
it
may
begin
inconsistent
in
this
respect
and
that
is
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
and
then
he
scheduled
a
show
cause
hearing
and
which
would
be
the
proper
procedure
under
mississippi
statute
for
an
indirect
contempt.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
it
would
not
be
improper
to
provide
a
fuller
hearing,
that’s
correct.
the
judge
ordered
the
show
cause
hearing
--
a
show
cause
petition
be
filed
and
within
the
two
days
of
the
such
order,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
that
judge
perry
disqualify
himself
from
the
pending
show
cause
hearing
alleging
personal
prejudice
and
further
alleging
that
since
the
judge
had
ordered
his
arrest,
he
could
not
fairly
decide
the
action.
on
february
1,
1967,
approximately
a
week
after
these
events,
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
removal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi.
it
was
not
until
some
21
1/2
months
that
elapsed
that
the
united
states
district
court
remanded
the
prosecution
to
the
grenada
county
circuit
court
holding
that
petitioner’s
remedy
in
the
federal
system
could
lie
only
after
he
demonstrated
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights
by
the
state
courts.
on
january
22,
1969,
prior
to
any
action
in
grenada
county
on
the
contempt
charge
and
two
months
after,
the
federal
court
had
returned
the
prosecution
to
the
state
system.
petitioner
and
others
filed
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
wholly
separate
action
to
restrain
trials
of
negroes
and

until
such
time
as
those
persons
were
not
systematically
excluded
from
juries
in
violation
of
the
u.s.
constitution.
judge
perry
was
named
as
one
of
the
defendants
in
that
action
and
served
with
the
process
on
january
23,
1969.
on
january
24,
1969,
a
summons
was
issued
directing
johnson
to
appear
in
judge
perry’s
courtroom
on
january
27th,
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
punished
on
the
old
contempt
charge.
on
january
27th,
petitioner
and
his
attorney
did
appear
in
front
of
judge
perry
for
the
show
cause
hearing
at
which
time
the
judge
canceled
the
hearing
instead
reading
a
contempt
conviction
sentencing
petitioner
to
four
months
in
jail.
bail
was
set
at
$2,000.00
and
subsequently
reduced
to
the
statutory
maximum
of
$300.00
for
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
later
that
same
morning
at
the
second
appearance
before
judge
perry,
in
an
effort
to
obtain
the
judge’s
signature
on
a
bill
of
exceptions,
the
judge
refused.
and
when
the
petitioner’s
attorney
prepared
the
bill
of
exceptions,
the
judge
summarily,
and
charged
hearing
contempt,
a
conviction
which
was
later
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
you
mean,
why
didn’t
punish
him
in
1967?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
record
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
record
does
not
show
why
he
didn’t.
the
record
only
shows
that
he
just
elected
to
travel
the
show
cause
route
rather
than
to
invoke
such
summary
powers
as
he
might
had
have
under
the
mississippi
statute.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
order
to
show
cause
was
returnable
on
february
1st,
i
think,
nine
days
after
the
alleged
contumacious
behavior.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
issued
almost
immediately
following
the
judge’s
order
that
a
show
cause
order
be
issued.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
why
was
it
not
heard
immediately?
the
judge
ordered
that
--
i
believe
the
judge
ordered
that
the
show
cause
petition
be
issued
within
48
hours
and
why
he
didn’t
set
it
down
for
an
earlier
hearing
is
just
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
second
one
was
two
years
later.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
february
1st
show
cause
hearing
was
not
held
because
by
that
time
a
removal
petition
had
been
filed
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
or
the
doer,
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
the
only
response
was
a
motion
filed
that
judge
perry
recused
himself
from
hearing
the
matter
and
that
motion
was
never
heard
and
never
determined
by
the
judge.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
there
was
then
a
suit
filed
against
judge
perry
that
was
after
21-and-a-half
months
had
elapsed
and
after
the
federal
system
had
returned
the
case
to
the
grenada
county
circuit
court.
about
two
months
after
the
case
had
been
returned
and
still
without
any
action
taken
in
grenada
county,
the
separate
suit
was
filed
by
petitioner
naming
judge
perry
as
the
defendant.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
you
mean
your
honor,
the
proceeding
that
was
going
on
in
the
courtroom?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
don’t
believe
there
was
any
proceeding
going
on
at
that
time.
i
believe
they
were
in
a
process
of
choosing
jurors
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
believe
they
were
selecting
jurors,
eligible
jurors,
for
all
the
pending
cases
in
that
term.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
the
record
suggests
none.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
just
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
reason
appears
to
have
been
the
request
by
the
deputy
sheriff
that
petitioner
walk
around
the
rear
of
the
room
when
he
take
his
seat
rather
than
take
the
more
direct
route
and
pass
in
front
of
the
prospective
jurors.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
he
was
scheduled
for
trial
during
that
term.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
believe
it
was
a
--
although,
it
is
not
indicated
in
the
record.
i
believe
it
was
a
trespass
case
which
was,
although,
there
wasn’t
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
don’t
know
what
it
was,
your
honor.
it’s
not
in
the
record
and
the
only
thing
that
is
in
the
record
which
we
have
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
is
that
the
--
there
was
never
any
prosecution
on
the
matter.
the
prosecution
on
the
substantive
charge
against
petitioner
was
dropped.
i
believe
it
was
a
trespass
arriving
out
of
a
civil
rights
demonstration.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i've
no
idea
your
honor.
it’s
not
in
the
record.
from
its
earliest
decisions,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
use
of
summary
procedures
to
convict
must
be
carefully
controlled
since
they
do
not
encompass
the
ordinary
procedural
safeguards
incorporated
in
our
system
of
justice,
the
right
of
an
accused
to
be
apprised
fully
of
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him,
the
right
to
put
on
defense,
the
right
to
counsel.
generally,
the
merrill
area
within
which
summary
contempt
proceedings
have
been
permitted
is
where
the
trial
judge
has
observed
the
contumacious
conduct
and
then
acts
swiftly
by
conviction
of
the
contemnor
rather
than
by
an
alternative
remedy
in
order
to
quell
a
disturbance
threatening
to
upset
the
sanctity
of
the
courtroom.
other
remedies
have
been
held
constitutionally
permissible
in
dealing
with
an
obstreperous
defendant.
this
court
recently
in
illinois
v.
allen
mentioned
at
least
two
others
restraint
and
removal
from
the
courtroom.
other
non-summary
conviction
procedures
suggests
themselves,
contempt
procedures
suggests
themselves
were
appropriate
such
as
a
civil
contempt.
a
postponement
of
the
proceedings
in
a
proper
case
or
by
the
judge,
informing
the
defendant
that
charges
will
be
preferred
against
him
for
contempt
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
refer
to
another
judge.
in
light
of
these
other
possible
remedies
and
in
light
of
these
court’s
recent
holding
in
mayberry
versus
pennsylvania
which
we
stripped
to
the
use
of
a
summary
conviction
after
a
trial’s
conclusion.
since
at
that
time,
immediate
restoration
of
order
is
no
--
or
vindication
of
the
authority
of
the
court
is
no
longer
the
primary
requisite.
petitioner’s
conviction
and
its
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
must
be
reversed
for
the
follow
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
--
that
is
also
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
there
are
several
possible
alternatives
which
suggest
themselves
your
honor.
there’s
several
affidavits
in
the
records
suggesting
the
judge’s
personal
bias
against
defendant
and
its
members
of
his
race
and
civil
rights
workers
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes.
and
also
allegations
of
prejudice
or
part
of
the
possibility
of
prejudice
as
a
result
of
a
lawsuit
filed
by
petitioner
naming
the
judges
or
defendant
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
at
the
time
of
the
second
show
cause
hearing.
that
might
--
i
would
suggest
might
even
be
a
greater
possibility
of
bias
than
most
present
in
the
exchange
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
the
suit
your
honor
against
the
judge
was
against
the
judge
and
several
others
for
systemically
restraining
and
preventing
negroes
and
laymen
from
serving
on
juries
in
grenada
county,
mississippi.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no.
but
the
petitioner
was
plaintiff.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor.
other
than
as
a
member
of
class.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
i
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
both
attorneys
that
he
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
both,
the
first
attorney
who
represented
him
the
day
of
the
alleged
contumacious
behavior
was
cited
for
contempt
for
protesting
in
judge
perry’s
court
that
the
show
cause
hearing
was
improper
and
that
trial
was
restrained
by
a
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
and
the
case
had
never
--
was
just
never
just
brought
to
trial
after
the
temporary
retraining
order
expired.
his
second
attorney,
the
attorney
who
represented
him
at
the
time
of
the
second
show
cause
hearing
or
the
time
the
second
show
cause
hearing
was
scheduled
was
also
cited
for
contempt
and
that
contempt
conviction,
that
summary
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
direct
contempt
before
the
judge
and
that
the
summary
procedure
did
not
apply.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
your
honor,
if
were
--
if
it
were
not
a
direct
contempt,
the
summary
procedure
would
not
be.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
he
did
not.
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
the
summary
procedure
would
be
then.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
it
would
not
be
the
correct
procedure
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
the
show
cause
procedure,
no
sir.
no
quarrel
with
the
procedure
that
was
scheduled.
we
are
alleging
that
the
failure
to
then
hold
the
show
cause
hearing
or
to
hear
the
motion
that
the
judge
recused
himself
and
that
the
show
cause
hearing
be
before
an
unbiased
judge
was
improper.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor.
i
don’t
suggest
that.
i
don’t
think
that
there's
any
suggestion
here
that
this
lawsuit
was
brought
to
divest
the
judge
of
his
power
to
hear
the
contempt
charge.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
a
major
factor
and
i
--
but
i
think
that
if
--
i
think
when
you
have
an
elapse
of
two
years
time,
you
have
your
petitioner
who
is
a
civil
rights
worker,
who
is
working
actively
in
that
field,
when
he
brings
a
lawsuit
which
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
well,
i
think,
if
you
have
an
intervening
legitimate
lawsuit
with
merits
which
is
not
brought
simply
to
divest
--
some
charge
in
order
to
divest
the
judge
of
his
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
contempt
charge,
i
think
you
have
an
intervening
factor
which
simply
requires
the
judge
to
excuse
himself.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
that
lawsuit
--
according
to
the
record
was
won
by
petitioner
of
the
federal
district
court,
issued
an
order
enjoining
the
judge
and
the
other
defendants
from
any
further
acts
which
would
violate
the
civil
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
class.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
order,
your
honor,
was
issued
and
judge
perry
and
others
were
enjoined
prior
to
the
time
that
the
judge
canceled
the
show
cause
hearing.
in
other
words,
the
suit
was
filed
within
the
matter
of
48
or
72
hours.
the
united
states
district
court
issued
its
injunction.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor.
i
would
not.
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
something
far
different
has
happened
--
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
i
think
something
far
different
has
happened
here.
there
was
no
finding
of
contempt
by
the
judge.
first
of
all,
it’s
not
clear
that
this
was
a
proper
case
in
which
there
could
be
a
finding
of
contempt
by
the
judge
without
a
hearing.
secondly,
even
if
this
were
the
case,
that
power
was
not
invoked
by
the
judge.
he
did
not
specifically
find
petitioner
in
contempt.
he
instead
ordered
a
show
cause
hearing.
he
ordered
two
show
cause
hearings
and
he
later
canceled
those
hearings.
and
we’re
suggesting
that
once
the
judge
has
elected
to
use
another
procedure,
unless
there
is
intervening
obstreperous
behavior,
there
may
not
be
a
cancellation
of
the
due
process
hearing
and
a
return
to
the
summary
procedure
because
at
that
point,
two
years
down
the
road
or
30
days
or
even
one
day
down
the
road,
there's
no
longer
any
need
to
call
the
disorder
in
the
courtroom
that
summary
procedure
has
historically
been
reserved
for
just
that
purpose,
to
quell
a
disruption
and
if
the
judge
elects
not
utilize
it
for
the
purpose
of
quelling
the
disruption,
he
ought
not
have
it
later.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor,
i
think
there
were
no
issues
of
fact
tendered.
the
petitioner
pointer
out
or
petitioner
appeared
for
the
show
cause
hearing
and
asked
through
his
attorney
to
put
on
a
defense
and
was
--
and
that
request
was
denied
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
which
is
in
the
record.
the
petitioner’s
attorney
states
that
she
was
prepared
to
present
evidence
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
did
not
behave
contumaciously.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
sir.
the
power
to
punish
summarily
in
any
event
if
this
court
is
to
permit
its
limited
--
in
limited
instances
its
continued
use,
should
only
be
sanctioned
or
all
else
is
proved
unavailing.
otherwise,
the
defendant
stands
confronted
with
the
conviction,
never
having
had
a
chance
to
assert
a
defense
but
the
only
protection
remaining
between
him
and
the
jailhouse
door
an
appeal
in
which
the
record
is
often
scanty
at
best
and
non-existent
at
worst.
such
an
appeal
even
if
ultimately
successful,
might
be
long
arduous
and
expensive
and
might
have
been
completely
avoided
if
all
the
facts
had
been
examined
in
unbiased
fashion
at
the
trial
level.
in
summary,
we
have
before
us
and
i
think
is
an
outrageous
case
which
amply
demonstrates
the
perils
of
the
misuse
of
the
power
to
punish
summarily.
his
power
was
here
employed
with
the
state’s
own
petition
admits
the
alleged
misconduct
do
not
occur
within
the
second
hearing
of
the
judge
or
an
alternative
remedy
had
been
selected
or
swiftness
was
not
a
prerequisite
and
whether
was
ample
evidence
of
possible
bias.
finally,
there
is
wholly
absent
from
the
record
in
this
case,
the
unusual
exceptional
or
flagrant
nature
of
behavior
which
is
ordinarily
a
condition
precedent
to
the
invocation
of
summary
procedures.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
immediately,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
rather
than
a
--
rather
than
a
sentence
of
four
months?
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
make
the
same
argument.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
it
is
the
process.
the
penalty
has
already
been
reduced
to
fit
to
the
statutory
maximum
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
to
the
statutory
maximum.
judge
perry’s
sentence
exceeded
the
statutory
maximum
and
it
was
reduced
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
to
the
statutory
maximum
of
30
days.
mr.
stephen
w.
porter
no,
your
honor.
