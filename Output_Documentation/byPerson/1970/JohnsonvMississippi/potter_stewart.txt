justice

trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
defendant
in
one
of
the
cases
that
the
court
was
going
to
try
during
that
term.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
going
on
in
the
courtroom?
was
a
trial
then
in
progress
or
doesn’t
the
record
show?
justice
potter
stewart
just
some
preliminary
matters
at
time.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
the
same
--
this
was
in
grenada
county
which
you
are
addressing?
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
this
the
same
judge
perry
who
was
involved
in
the
proceedings
in
winston
county
and
as
related
in
the
appendix
c
to
your
brief?
this
is
the
same
judge
perry?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
two
problems
with
your
argument
and
i
may
say
so
unless
you
can
straighten
it
out
mr.
lyell.
about
your
argument
as
to
the
mississippi
statute
that
gives
the
supreme
court
reviewing
power.
in
this
particular
case
in
its
opinion,
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
said,
“upon
appeal
with
this
court
from
a
conviction
of
direct
contempt,
the
statement
of
the
substantive
facts
set
out
in
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
will
be
taken
as
true
and
correct.”
so
that’s
pretty
far
away
from
any
sort
of
factual
review
that
i
had
understood
you
were
suggesting.
and
secondly,
since
there
was
no
hearing,
there
really
wasn’t
anything
to
review
in
this
case
if
they
took
the
findings
in
the
trial
court's
judgment
as
true
and
correct.
and
if
the
trial
judge
didn’t
conduct
a
hearing
on
the
show
cause
order.
there
was
just
no
review
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there's
never
been
a
denial
of
this
or
is
there
ever
been
any
opportunity
for
a
denial.
as
i
read
the
statement
of
the
facts
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
it
boiled
out
to
the
fact
that
at
nine
o’clock
in
the
morning
on
january
27,
1969,
johnson
with
his
lawyer
appeared
before
judge
perry
and
denying
johnson’s
request
for
a
hearing.
judge
perry
read
the
order,
judging
johnson
in
criminal
contempt
and
sentencing
him
to
four
months
in
prison.
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
if
there
was
no
hearing
or
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
if
there
was
denial
of
a
hearing
and
if
the
appellate
court
takes
the
facts
stated
in
the
judgment
of
the
trial
judge
as
true
and
correct,
i
don’t
see
how
there
could’ve
been
any
appellate
review
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
the
dumb
noble
kind
of
a
review
that
you
suggest
that
mississippi
statute
requires?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
on
page
40
of
the
appendix,
it
stated
that
martha
m.
wood,
and
that
was
his
lawyer
as
i
understand
it.
at
that
time,
requested
a
hearing
which
request
was
denied
now,
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
was
1969,
9:00
am
on
january
27,
1969.
at
that
day,
at
which
johnson
was
found
to
be
in
contempt
and
there
was
a
denial
of
a
request
for
a
hearing
according
to
the
--
justice

now,
where
is
that
in

i've
looked
through
it
and
i
can’t

justice

if
i
may
suggests,
it
seems
to
me
what
they
are

they
are
the
bill

exceptions,
isn't
this
what
the
supreme
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
explain
on

43
an
item
in

15
under

two
lawyers

justice

stewart
that’s
what
happened
and
that
could
hardly
be
contemptuous
--
justice
potter
stewart
no.
it
was
a
petition
to
remove
the
case
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
court
held
that
petition
for
a
matter
of
several
months
as
i
understand
it.
and
has
been
added
it
to
the
state
judge
and
there
followed
the
second
order
to
show
cause,
wasn’t
that
it?
and
then,
they
came
to
the
court
in
response
to
that
and
according
to
that
what
this
record
shows,
they
asked
for
a
