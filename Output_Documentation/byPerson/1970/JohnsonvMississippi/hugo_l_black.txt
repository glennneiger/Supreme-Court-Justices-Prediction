justice

the
judge
on
the

--
why
was
it
the
judge
knew
this
episode
happens?
did
he
punish
summarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
why
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
immediately
when
the
episode
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
was
being
tried
at
the
time
this
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
over
the
court
at
the
time
the
court
was
interrupted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn’t
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
complaints
to
the
court
about
anything
that
had
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
just
a
disorder
that
happened.
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
any
reason.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
he
on
trial
or
charged
for
that
term?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
trespass?
what
was
it
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
restaurant
or
something
like
a
court
has
or
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposing
a
judge
here
has
contempt
committed
in
his
presence,
(inaudible)
he
says,
“i
find
you
in
contempt.”
i
oppose
the
wrong
sentencing
to
the
inclusion
of
the
trial
until
i
get
through
with
this
case
and
he
brings
(inaudible)
impose
30
days
on
you.
would
you
hold
bar
with
that
procedure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
that
be
equivalent
of
what's
happened
here
or
is
it
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
trying
to
get
at
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
‘69
show
cause
order
was
issued
that
was
the
operative
one
in
your
view,
was
the
response
put
in
and
answer
put
in
by
your
client?
what
i’m
getting
at
with
the
issues
in
fact
tendered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
already
been
reduced
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
heard
you
say,
it
means
offers
some
excuse
for
doing
something,
admits
you’ve
done
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
is
that
statement
on
page
40?
what
was
it
put
there
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
man
has
gotten
up,
he
could
be
tried
for
contempt
and
he
has
asked
for
a
hearing
and
they
say
they
won’t
give
it
to
him
in
part
of
his
audacity
in
going
into
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
accepted
as
a
good
defense
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
to
reject
a
man’s
claim
to
be
heard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
is
asking
here
for
a
hearing
only
which
means
that
he
is
denying
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
it
is
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
this
defense
but
didn't
ask,
didn't
you?
his
defense
was
not
that
he
had
previously
been
given
an
answer
but
he
had
the
audacity
to
go
on
to
federal
court
and
try
to
get
relief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whenever
it
was,
is
that
correct
in
mississippi
and
do
you
consider
it
correct
to
his
attorney
general
to
tell
a
defendant
who
is
gone
into
federal
court
that
he
has
had
the
audacity
to
go
there
and
you
won’t
hear
anything
else
upon
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
alabama
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
there
is
some
similarity
between
mississippi
and
alabama
proceedings.
if
you
have
an
exception
in
alabama
and
i
think
it
is
in
mississippi,
the
statements
of
the
facts
tested
to
by
the
judge
or
exemplified
as
being
the
truth
of
what
appeared
as
shown
in
the
bill
of
exceptions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
some
of
them
are
not
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
those
report
that
that
is
there
and
accepted
as
the
bill
of
exceptions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
what
you
call
a
bystanders
bill
of
exceptions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here,
you
have
a
bill
of
exceptions
appearing
to
us
as
being
signed
and
being
the
bill
of
exceptions
which
states
the
facts
that
we
should
accept
these
facts,
isn’t
that
right?
justice

this
one
