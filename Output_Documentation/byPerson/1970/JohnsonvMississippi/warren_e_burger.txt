chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
5485,
johnson
against
mississippi.
mr.
porter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
your
view
if
the
judge
then
and
there
or
upon
the
adjournment
of
court
that
had
imposed
the
sentence
of
30
days
for
contempt
of
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
obviously,
what
happens
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it’s
a
spectator,
a
tourist,
a
defendant,
or
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
except
that
it
might
be
a
higher
degree
of
culpability
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven’t
indicated
your
view
of
the
matter
but
you
don’t
need
to,
the
view
of
the
court’s
power
summarily
to
deal
with
utterance
of
that
kind
in
the
courtroom,
do
you
question
the
court’s
power
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
an
utterance
in
the
courtroom
by
any
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
take
it,
it
was
issued
almost
immediately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
the
summary
procedure
then
was
the
correct
procedure
under
mississippi
law
to
use
in
johnson’s
case,
i
take
it,
since
it
was
not
in
your
view
a
direct
contempt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
he
didn’t
use
the
summary
procedure
here,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
you
don’t
have
any
quarrel
with
the
procedure
that
the
judge
used
to
deal
with
contemnor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
a
person
in
the
posture
of
johnson
may
disqualify
a
judge
by
bringing
a
lawsuit
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
your
earlier
argument,
you
suggested
that
this
is
one
of
the
large
factors
i
think
that’s
the
way
you
put
it,
in
a
probable
bias
since
he
was
a
defendant
in
the
lawsuit.
the
judge
was
the
defendant
in
the
lawsuit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he’s
civil
rights
worker
or
a
plumber
if
he
is
guilty
of
contumacious
conduct
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
that
lawsuit
been
tried?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
go
right
on
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
a
sentence
penalty
of
30
days
had
been
imposed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anytime.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
it
isn’t
your
--
it
isn’t
the
length
of
the
penalty
you’re
complaining
about,
it’s
the
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lyell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
there
be
anything
inconsistent
between
hearing
it
and
having
it
reported
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
cannot
be
found
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
position
he
defaulted
in
his
opportunity
to
present
evidence
and
litigation,
or
to
purge
or
to
claim
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
the
occasion
that
justice
stewart
is
referring
to
then
in
your
view
was
just
the
occasion
to
hear
this
judge’s
sentence
for
contempt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
counsel,
counsel
as
i
understand
it.
this
material
on
page
40,
41
etcetera
beginning
in
38
are
the
allegations
set
forth
in
the
bill
of
exceptions,
that’s
not
evidentiary
matter
in
the
sense
of
a
record
made
at
that
time.
these
are
in
the
nature
of
allegations
that
would
appear
in
a
compliant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
point
counsel
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
signatures
--
what
signatures
appear
on
--
well,
if
i'm
reading
the
correct
document
on
page
44,
you
have
three
lawyers
for
johnson
have
signed
this
petition
and
then
the
clerk
of
the
court
had
certified
that
this
is
the
true
and
certified
copy
of
what
the
lawyers
have
filed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel
in
the
appendix
or
anywhere
else,
do
we
have
any
record,
any
account
of
what
took
place
when
johnson
failed
to
appear
in
response
to
the
first
order
to
show
cause
as
you
said,
he
failed
to
appear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
failure
to
appear
in
response
to
in
order
to
show
cause
at
a
fixed
time
and
place,
be
in
itself
a
contempt
under
mississippi
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
in
itself
be
a
contempt,
the
failure
to
appear
in
response
to
an
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
