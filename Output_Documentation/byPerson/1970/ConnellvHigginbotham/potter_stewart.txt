we
have
to
overrule
the
decision
in
this
--
very
recent
decision
of
this
court
to
in
order
to
sustain
your
objection?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
wasn't
affirmance
on
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
quite
understand
how
you
distinguished
public
school
teachers
from
lawyers
for
admission
to
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
do
concede
that
lawyers
maybe
required
to
take
such
an
oath,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
have
a
rule
of
this
court
that
requires
--
justice
potter
stewart
everybody
takes
such
an
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
a
little
curious
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
note
that
the
first
oath
submitted
to
the
petitioner
was
the
one
that
had
been
very
explicitly
invalidated
by
this
court
more
than
10
years
ago,
more
than
almost
10
years
before
she
was
asked
to
take
this
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
practice
--
is
it
the
practice
for
your
clients
to
nonetheless
to
submit
that
oath
and
to
have
applicants
signed
it
if
they're
willing
to
do
so
even
though
this
court's
held
is
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
they
haven't
tell
and
although
they
are
parties
in
the
cramp
case,
they
hadn't
received
the
word
of
our
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
very
parties
in
the
case,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
some
other
parties,
overlapping
party.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
know
whether
or
not
it's
the
--
it
was
at
least
the
practice
--
their
practice
to
submit
this
form
generally
or
whether
this
was
just
an
individual
idiosyncrasy?
