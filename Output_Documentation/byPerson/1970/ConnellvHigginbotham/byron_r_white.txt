justice
byron
r.
white
did
we
make
to
the
one
and
not
to
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
frankly
that
you
were
saying
the
vagueness
of
this
oath?
justice
byron
r.
white
supporting
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
concept
of
academic
freedom
go
so
far
or
maybe
not
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
school
or
a
university
could
not
hire
a
professor
who
was
advising
students
to
use
say
violence
to
achieve
their
goals
in
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well
we'll
get
closer.
what
if
--
could
they
ask
him
when
he
takes
his
job,
wants
the
job
--
do
you
intend
to
advice
students
to
use
violence
to
achieve
their
ends
in
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
a
fortiori,
you
couldn't
ask
him,
“do
you
believe
in
the
use
of
violence
to
achieve
social
ends?”
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
may
not
leave
or
keep
him
out
of
his
job
for
that,
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
could
ask
him
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you'd
say
that
you
couldn't
--
that
if
he
refused
to
answer,
you
couldn't
fire
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that's
even
--
you
would
say
its
bad
even
if
the
state
conceded
if
the
--
that
if
the
answer
is
yes,
they
couldn't
fire
him
without
answering
some
other
questions,
without
asking
him
some
other
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
whether
--
which
way
do
you
run
that
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
belief
part
of
this
oath?
i
take
it
there's
a
belief
clause
that
survived
below
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
position
about
that
it
might
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
other
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
affirm
judgments
and
not
opinions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
want
to
pursue
your
position
that
in
case
of
a
school
teacher
it's
quite
alright
for
a
state
to
bar
a
school
teacher
for
refusing
to
answer
a
question,
“do
you
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violent?”
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
--
i
take
it,
your
saying
and
if
they
say,
yes,
i
believe
in
the
overthrow
by
force
or
violence
or
if
they
refuse
to
take
the
oath
saying,
i
do
not
believe
in
it,
that
right
then
and
there
that
florida
may
bar
the
person
from
teaching,
is
just
doesn't
a
preliminary
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
we
make

the
