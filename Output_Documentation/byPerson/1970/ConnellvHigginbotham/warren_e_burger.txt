mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
have
objected
if
it
stopped
after
the
first
section?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
think
it
is
unconstitutional
for
this
court
to
require
as
we
did
this
morning,
seven
or
eight
men
to
take
an
oath
that
they
will
support
and
defend
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
for
lack
of
a
hearing,
hearing
on
what
and
at
what
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
policeman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
civics
teachers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
and
if
anyone
declined
to
take
it,
he
would
not
be
admitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
they
make
difference
between
doing
that
and
signing
it
in
writing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
put
those
two
together
all
the
time.
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
intentionally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
case
are
now
before
us
is
a
school
teacher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
too
much
about
the
garbage
collector,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
--
you
think
that
school
teachers
are
entitled
to
more
freedom
in
that
respect
than
the
supreme
court
justices
and
lawyers
to
practice
before
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

give
us
the

warren
e.
burger
was
the
first
one
passed
the
same
one
as
it
is
now
in
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
the
way
you
do
in
this
court
in
the
morning
in
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

a
question
--
