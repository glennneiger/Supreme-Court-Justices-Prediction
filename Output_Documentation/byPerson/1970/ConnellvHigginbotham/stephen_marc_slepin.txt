mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir,
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
employing
a
perspective
slightly
different
from
the
perspective
in
which
the
appellee's
brief
was
cast
without
abandoning
any
of
the
arguments
in
that
brief,
in
the
next
few
moments
i
just
like
to
take
account
of
appellant's
argument
within
the
somewhat
per
se
context
of
a
three-fold
argument
if
i
may.
the
position
that
the
appellees
going
to
advance
to
the
court
this
afternoon
are
briefly
stated
these.
first,
we
think
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
assuming
and
we
think
to
that
it
was
on
operative
assumption
that
oaths
per
se,
we're
not
concerned
for
the
moment
with
the
content
of
the
oath,
are
constitutionally
legitimate
running
as
they
do,
we
think
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
through
the
very
pith
and
marrow
of
the
american
experience.
secondly,
we
think
the
court
was
correct
in
advancing
that
assumption
to
a
position
that
governmental
employment
as
such
maybe
conditioned
upon
an
oath
under
certain
circumstances
and
we'll
deal
again
with
the
content
of
the
oath
in
just
a
moment.
secondly,
we're
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
court
was
quite
correct
in
upholding
after
certain
judicial
excisions,
the
instant
oath
which
is
now
before
this
court
and
in
the
context
of
that
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
due
process
arguments
advanced
by
the
appellant.
and
then
finally,
i'd
like
to
advance
the
argument
that
the
court
below
was
correct
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
severalability
in
holding
in
effect
that
the
doctrine
is
alive
and
is
well,
and
then
the
case
of
jackson
and
as
well
as
in
the
cramp
case
is
alive,
well
and
resident
within
this
very
chambers.
first
of
all,
your
honors,
we're
going
to
be
somewhat
less
categorical
than
the
appellant.
we
want
to
speak
to
this
case
before
the
bar
at
this
point
and
we
will
paint
with
a
brush
less
broad
than
a
comet's
tail.
we
want
to
take
the
position,
your
honors
as
this
court
knows,
that
article
ii,
section
vii
of
the
constitution
itself
prescribes
an
oath
and
later,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
oath
which
it
does
prescribe
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
far
broader,
far
vaguer
if
you
will,
far
less
specific
than
the
oath
with
which
were
confronted
in
the
instant
case.
article
vi,
clause
ii
of
the
constitution
requires
that
all
executive,
judicial
and
legislative
officers
of
the
united
states
and
the
several
states
must
subscribe
to
an
oath
and
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
the
first
congress
in
1789
precisely
prescribed
an
oath.
this
morning,
i
stood
before
this
court
and
very
proudly
subscribed
to
an
oath
promulgated
by
this
court
and
imposed
upon
me
by
this
court
pursuant
to
rule
v,
an
oath
which
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
was
a
tri-part
tied
oath
was
far
more
expensive,
if
you
will,
far
less
specific
than
the
oath
attendant
to
the
cause
at
bar
at
the
present
time.
in
the
case
of
bond
v.
floyd,
this
court
held
very
categorically
it
seem
to
me
if
somewhat
off
handedly,
“a
legislator
of
course
can
be
required
to
swear
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
a
condition
of
holding
office.
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
state's
contention
that
the
oath
provisions
of
the
united
states
in
georgia
constitutions
do
not
violate
the
first
amendment.”
and
then
finally,
at
page
247
of
lawyers
edition
in
bond
v.
floyd,
“of
course
a
state
may
constitutionally
require
a
note
to
support
the
constitution
from
its
legislators,”
and
then,
as
mr.
rosen
pointed
out
in
the
hosack
case,
in
the
knight
case,
and
the
olson
case
affirmed
by
this
court,
the
so-called
affirmative
mode
of
the
loyalty
oath
was
exacted,
it
was
sustained
and
this
court
affirmed.
in
gilmore
versus
james,
which
was
a
case
that
had
to
do
precisely
with
organizational
membership
and
that
particular
oath
or
affidavit
was
struck
down,
nevertheless,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
affirmative
mode
of
an
oath
as
such
was
hardly
repugnant
to
the
constitution
because
the
constitution
requires
one
in
one
place
and
prescribes
it
in
another
place.
and
then
lastly,
in
the
case
of
stewart
versus
washington
which
again,
is
not
on
point
because
it
dealt
with
subscription
to
title
v
of
the
us
code
was
a
far
more
involved
case
than
the
one
at
bar,
nevertheless
in
dicta,
stewart
versus
washington
the,
court
pointed
out
that
the
oath
in
the
affirmative
mode
was
part
and
parcel
of
our
constitution
and
our
constitutional
experience.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
oath
per
se
is
constitutionally
legitimate
on
at
least
two
grounds.
number
one,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
two
articles,
admits
of
an
oath
and
prescribes
an
oath.
and
then
secondly,
this
court
has
held
and
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
mitchell
case
and
i
would
cite
the
court
as
well
to
ex
parte
curtis
that
governmental
employment
maybe
conditioned
and
maybe
conditioned
in
such
a
way
that
the
employee
may
claim
an
infringement
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
but
that
the
court
itself
will
then
determine
not
whether
there
has
been
an
infringement
because
in
the
mitchell
case
upholding
the
hatch
act,
the
court
admitted
an
infringement
of
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
rights
derivative
there
from,
but
it
will
decide
rather
the
permissibility
or
impermissibility
of
the
extent
of
this
alleged
infringement.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
it
was
unquestionably
done
in
this
case.
the
error
is
unblinkable
your
honor.
i
have
no
knowledge
that
it
has
been
done
elsewhere.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
case
of
error,
omission,
oversight
or
delinquency
and
the
case
of
adams
which
is
you
know
is
to
be
before
this
court
and
various
portions
of
that
record
are
included,
was
a
case
incidentally
where
some
of
the
members
of
the
university
of
florida
staff
were
employed
for
some
substantial
period
of
time
before
they
were
ever
presented
with
an
oath
which
is
very
much
like
knight
versus
the
board
of
regents
pointed
out
if
the
oath
was
adopted
1934
and
i
think
the
knight
case
is
brought
in
1967,
several
years
after
some
members
of
that
faculty
of
the
delphi
had
been
employed
not
presented
with
the
oath.
it
was
a
delinquency
in
this
case
your
honor
and
the
court
moved
very
quickly
to
remedy
that
delinquency
and
to
point
out
as
did
the
board
of
public
education
in
orange
county
after
it
was
notified
by
counsel
from
mrs.
kennel
that
that
portion
of
the
oath
which
this
court
had
dealt
with
in
the
cramp
case
had
no
proper
place
being
submitted
to
mrs.
kennel
and
she
was
under
no
legal
obligation
to
subscribe.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
the
ways
of
a
government
executive
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
they
were
indeed
parties
to
the
case
your
honor.
although,
this
was
not
the
same
school
board
and
not
the
same
superintendent
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
but
there's
no
question
that
that
was
an
error
and
a
delinquency
on
their
part,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no
sir.
no
sir,
that
was
the
point
of
the
question
i
suspect
without
any
knowledge
and
i
have
no
knowledge
that
this
was
adduced
in
the
testimony
below
that
the
impermissible
form
with
the
excise
phrase
was
generally
distributed,
yes
sir.
and
in
fact
in
the
adams
case,
the
court
will
recall
from
those
portions
of
the
record
which
are
included
in
the
appellant's
brief,
there
was
remedial
action
taken
by
the
administration,
admittedly
10
years
after
the
fact
to
withdraw
the
impermissibly
enlarged
oath
and
to
submit
a
revised
oath
with
the
excise
provision
deleted,
yes
sir.
the
position
that
the
appellees
wish
to
take
before
this
court
is
complicated
somewhat
your
honors
by
virtue
of
our
inability
to
follow
this
ariadne
thread
of
the
appellant.
the
appellant
seems
to
take
the
position
that
vagueness
is
applicable
when
a
person
is
a
school
teacher,
but
vagueness
as
a
constitutional
challenge
somehow
is
not
applicable
when
one
is
a
legislator.
to
take
the
position
that
some
of
the
arguments
apply
to
sanitarians,
but
others
don't
seem
to
apply
to
teachers
and
i
confess,
though
this
is
an
admission
which
perhaps
i'm
not
compel
to
make,
that
i'm
not
quite
following
that
particular
argument.
i
am
following
the
argument
of
this
court's
statement
in
bond,
in
the
three
cases
which
it
affirmed
and
with
respect
to
the
oath,
i
took
with
respect
to
the
two
prescribe
oaths
that
government
employment
maybe
conditioned
upon
the
exaction
of
an
oath.
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
right
now
that
i
am
persuative
that
the
state
of
florida
and
then
the
other
state
could
exact
from
a
doctor
who
becomes
an
employee
of
the
state
and
who
takes
the
position
as
an
employee
in
one
of
the
state
hospitals.
an
oath
making
him
disclaim,
if
you
will,
that
he
is
suppose
to
intercept
us,
to
making
disclaim
that
he
is
an
advocate
of
euthanasia
and
its
not
beyond
the
realm
or
by
the
reason
or
experience
that
a
man
who
favors
euthanasia
or
a
man
who
was
opposed
to
dr.
lester's
discoveries
and
who
does
not
believe
in
antiseptic
procedures,
founds
it
upon
either
religious
commitment
or
you
if
will,
political
commitment.
morris
cone
once
said
not
who
--
not
all
who
rave
or
divinely
inspired
and
it
maybe
that
a
man
is
misdirected,
but
nevertheless
feels
he
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
believe
in
euthanasia.
yet,
i
think
that
an
oath
per
se
addressed
to
this
individual
is
most
eminently
reasonable
and
ought
not
to
offend
constitutional
rights.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
there
are
your
honor
and
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
our
position
is
that
there
are
two
belief
clauses
and
i
think
that's
precisely
what
the
appellant
said.
the
appellant
said
that
the
affirmative
mode
of
the
oath
which
reads
as
follows,
“i
do
hear
by
solemnly
swear
that
i
will
support
the
constitution”
is
in
point
of
fact
he
says.
a
belief
oath
and
its
really
a
negative
oath
masquerading
as
an
affirmative
oath.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
the
other
requirement
is
“i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
florida
by
force
and
violence”
and
we
support
that
and
i
should
like
to
cite
to
the
court
at
this
point
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
in
olson
versus
phillips
affirmed
by
this
court
at
397
u.s.
317.
the
olson
oath
was
an
oath
your
honor,
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
colorado.
in
explanation
of
that
oath,
the
olson
case
went
on
to
say
and
i
quote,
“the
present
oath
is
an
affirmation
of
belief
in
organic
law
and
disbelief
in
the
use
of
force
to
overthrow
the
government.”
and
i
think
that's
a
quite
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
you
do
indeed,
your
honor
and
i'm
urging
upon
the
court
the
reasoning
of
the
olson
court
not
the
strict
words
which
i'm
--
which
i
certainly
would
not
claim
that
this
court
adopted
per
se.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
if
the
affirmative
oath
means
anything
to
uphold
the
constitution,
it
seems
to
me
could
quite
reasonably
and
i
think
its
preeminently
reasonable
mean
that
one
of
vows
a
belief
in
organic
law
and
the
infinite
mutability
of
the
constitution
through
the
organic
process
and
the
avowal
simultaneously
a
disbelief
in
the
utilization
of
force
and
violence
to
overthrow
the
government.
now,
the
point
that
we
wish
to
make
in
this
regard
is
simply
this:
no
hearing
procedure
is
prescribed
or
allowed
by
the
constitution
with
respect
to
president
of
the
united
states
nor
with
respect
to
myself
and
my
four
colleagues
who
stood
before
the
bar
this
morning,
nor
is
it
allowed
so
far
as
i
know
to
members
of
the
executive
legislative
and
judicial
departments
of
the
federal
government
of
the
several
states.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
excuse
me,
sir.
you
mean,
it's
authorized
by
the
sixth
amendment?
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
respectfully
i
disagree
on
this
ground.
i
disagree
on
simply
ground
and
i
trust
it's
not
too
simplistic
that
oaths
per
se
are
not
anathematized
by
the
constitution.
the
constitution
is
very
specific
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
precisely.
and
because
oaths
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
certainly
not.
we
wouldn't
urge
that
upon
this
court.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
we
think
is
the
first
order
of
business
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
shelton
and
as
it
pointed
out
before
that
in
abler.
school
room
is
a
very
sensitive
place.
the
minds
of
our
students
are
a
very
sensitive
instruments,
malleable
as
they
should
be
and
the
state
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'm
not
the
quite
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
--
there's
anything
about
the
minds
of
law
school
students
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
it
applies
to
them
indeed
your
honor.
i
should
hope
that
the
minds
of
law
schools
students
are
subject
to
imprint
by
their
professors.
at
least,
it's
been
suggested
to
me.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
at
any
rate,
the
state
does,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
have
a
vital
concern
in
maintaining
the
security
of
the
state
and
the
question
is,
what
can
they
do
in
that
regard?
now,
if
i
have
to
swear
an
oath
and
an
oath
which
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
requires
me,
not
merely
to
uphold
the
constitution
your
honor,
but
an
oath
to
conduct
myself
uprightly
whatever
that
means,
to
draw
upon
the
vagueness
argument
of
the
appellant,
an
oath
to
conduct
myself
according
to
law
whatever
that
means
to
draw
upon
the
scalpel
use
by
the
appellant,
then
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
its
far
more
specific
to
require
in
the
affirmative
and
the
negative
mode,
these
two
avows
of
belief
and
disbelief
and
that's
all
the
state
of
florida
is
doing.
the
question
is,
are
oaths
per
se
anathematized
by
the
constitution
and
the
answer
is
no.
may
the
government
condition
employment
or
office
upon
the
exaction
of
the
oath
and
the
answer
is
sometimes
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
oath.
is
a
hearing
necessary
if
one
requires
an
officer
or
employee
to
swear
that
he
will
uphold
the
constitution.
none
has
provided
the
president,
none
is
provided
me,
none
is
provided
you.
we
think
it's
not
necessary
with
respect
to
an
affirmative
oath.
is
it
vague
to
say
that
one
swears
to
preserve,
to
protect,
and
to
defend
the
constitution
as
the
president
must
according
to
article
ii.
certainly,
it's
far
vaguer
than
saying,
i
don't
believe
in
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
is
it
a
prediction
as
opposed
to
a
promise
because
appellant
asks
this
court
to
invalidate
this
oath
on
the
grounds
that
it
may
well
be
a
mere
prediction.
one
maybe
predicting
when
one
says,
i
do
not
believe
in
the
violent
overthrow,
that
violent
overthrow
will
come
as
opposed
to
promising.
i
should
think
that
this
was
set
to
rest
in
the
dodge
(ph)
case
when
the
court
says,
that
belief
means
a
promise;
not
a
prediction
and
if
were
not
content
with
the
dodge
(ph)
case
in
light
of
subsequent
cases,
then
i
merely
refer
this
court
to
the
oath
prescribed
by
article
ii
which
says,
i
will
execute
and
surely
the
president
is
saying
that
he
promises
to
execute,
not
that
history
will
demonstrate
that
he
did
execute.
the
meaning
of
these
oaths
your
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
test
of
the
constitutionality
of
it.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
most
surely
do
not
sir.
i
see
no
need
for
a
hearing
and
the
very
interesting
argument,
and
i
think
the
correct
argument
made
in
the
smiley
and
olson
cases
is
that
a
hearing
has
to
do
with
the
weighing
and
sifting
and
finding
of
evidence.
it
has
to
do
with
the
confrontation
of
the
accusers
and
it
has
to
do
with
cross
examination,
none
of
which
applies
to
the
instant
situation.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir.
as
i
pointed
out
and
indeed
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
state
has
very
compelling
concern
it
seems
to
me
in
the
beliefs
as
a
spring
to
action.
surely,
we're
not
so
obstructionist
that
we
want
to
be
exceedingly
careful
as
to
belief
that
human
belief
is
a
relevant
to
human
conduct.
and
this
court
has
pointed
out
time
and
again
that
the
state
has
a
vital
concern
in
education.
indeed
in
the
brown
case
versus
the
board
of
education,
it
was
noted
that
education
the
principle
business
today
of
government.
this
court
has
noted
in
shelton
and
tucker
and
earlier
adler
is
concerned
with
the
very
sensitive
minds
of
its
students.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no
sir.
unlike
one
or
two
of
other
cases
with
which
this
court
was
concerned,
principally
the
case
of
the
california
tax
exemption,
there
is
no
weighing
and
sifting,
no
judgmental
element
which
enters
into
this.
and
that
case
is
the
court
recalls,
the
assessor
was
mandated
to
make
factual
determinations.
the
swearing
of
this
oath
or
the
refusal
to
swear
the
oath
is
dispositive
of
the
matter
under
florida
law
and
one
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'll
comment
directly
upon
it
at
this
point
if
i
may
sir.
i
think
its
probably
true
that
one
who
is
engaged
in
espionage
or
one
who
has
an
insidious
purpose
is
not
going
to
scruple
at
either
lying
or
taking
some
other
action
which
will
avoid,
placing
them
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
or
which
will
at
place
him
outside
the
area
in
which
he
would
like
to
find
himself
to
carry
out
his
mission
and
while
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
and
i
should
certainly
be
a
fooling
and
diluting
myself
if
i
were
to
take
any
other
position
that
the
florida
loyalty
oath
like
any
oath
is
not
a
panacea
in
terms
of
security.
and
that
the
florida
loyalty
oath
does
not
assure
the
school
authorities
that
they're
having
present
in
their
classrooms,
competent,
dedicated
loyal
people.
it
is
a
measure
number
one,
which
we
don't
think
is
constitutionally
impermissible
and
therefore,
it
is
measure
as
are
so
many
measures
within
the
broad
discretion
of
the
legislator
of
the
state
of
florida.
and
if
the
legislature
of
the
state
feels
that
this
is
one
important
symbol
and
the
symbol
which
may
have
more
or
less
utilitarian
effect,
then
it
seems
to
me
so
long
as
it
is
constitutionally
permissible,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
florida
and
her
sister
states
must
be
granted
that
leave
to
impose
such
a
symbolic
oath.
and
indeed
we
would
seize
upon
the
question
put
to
counsel
for
appellant,
it
is
in
point
of
fact
a
symbolic
oath
and
we
feel
it
is
a
symbolic
and
it
is
important
to
note
as
was
subscribed
before
this
court
this
morning,
and
as
the
constitution
itself
requires.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
1949,
i
believe
was
the
initial
act
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'm
not
aware
of
any
your
honor,
but
i
certainly
wouldn't
be
surprise
if
there
were
some
kind
of
oath
required.
i'm
not
precisely
aware
of
that
and
perhaps
counsel
for
appellant
can
answer
that
as
he
rises.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
the
same
one,
but
far
more
abundant
because
it
contains
the
provision
which
was
excise
by
this
court
in
cramp
and
then
contained
the
other
provisions
which
were
excise
by
the
court
below
and
we're
not
arguing
about
those
judicial
excisions.
so,
it
was
generally
the
same
oath,
but
it
contained
three
more
provisions
that
it
now
contains
as
it
sits
before
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
have
no
knowledge
your
honor
of
any
persons
being
discharged
other
than
those
who
are
the
parties
to
the
cases
now
before
the
court.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
there
are
several
thousand
teachers
in
the
state.
there
are
many,
many,
many
thousands
of
state
employees.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
oh!
i'm
sorry
sir.
three
in
the
adams
case
and
mrs.
kennel
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
four
in
all,
i
think
your
honor.
four
in
all
i
believe.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
should
suspect
that
there
was
but
i
know
of
no
statute
prior
to
1949
and
my
research
didn't
reveal
one.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
they
are
until
the
first
few
years
of
teaching
your
honor,
where
upon
the
gaining
continuing
contracts
and
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
two
or
three
years
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
strongly
suspect
that
they
would
your
honor,
yes,
but
i'm
not
all
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no,
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
precisely
in
the
--
i
think
it
stands
on
the
same
feet
as
the
oath
sworn
before
this
court
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
it
is
not
given
to
me
to
exercise
judicial
interpretation,
but
i
suspect
that
the
oath
which
she
did
take,
has
some
very
real
meaning
to
it
and
i
think
it
involves
a
very
real
commitment
of
belief
as
this
court
stated
in
the
dodge
(ph)
case
and
belief
means
a
promise.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
there
is
no
leeway
in
this
respect
because
it
applies
to
all
state
employees
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
--
of
every
sort
or
variety,
including
the
sanitarian
whom
i
think
occupies
an
extremely
important
place
and
society
and
anyone
who
has
roamed
through
new
york
during
the
garbage
strike
is
acutely
and
the
sensitively
aware
of
that.
and
i
should
think
that
the
state
even
has
a
compelling
interest
in
maintaining
whatever
symbolic
protections
it
can
with
respect
to
the
sanitarian,
who
on
my
scale
of
values
is
not
the
lowly
creature
who
is
below
oath.
he
is
not
below
an
oath
anymore
than
the
teacher
is
above
an
oath
because
again,
the
oath
itself
is
not
anathema
and
secondly
because
this
particular
oath
is
well
within
what
we
think
the
court
has
decided
is
permissible.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
for
university
personnel,
your
honor.
for
public
school
personnel,
it's
what's
called
a
continuing
contract,
meaning
that
after
they've
taught
for
approximately
three
years,
they
then
go
on
a
continuing
contract
and
may
only
be
dismissed
for
cause
and
they
are
procedures
outlined
for
that.
so,
it's
called
continuing
contract
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
schools,
a
tenure
in
the
higher
education
area.
and
let
me
just
fleetingly
refer
to
severability.
this
court
stated
the
rule
in
jackson.
it
was
stated
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
cramp
and
it's
quite
clear
that
we
have
an
affirmative,
the
negative
mode
requiring
in
a
avowal
of
belief
and
avowal
of
disbelief
fundamentally
probably
the
same
of
avowals,
if
you
will,
and
i
don't
think
the
constitution,
and
i
think
the
cases
don't
say
that
the
constitution
anathematizes
a
grammatically
negative
oath
irrespective
of
what
the
meaning
of
it
is.
and
i
should
think
that
this
court
would
not
commit
itself
to
the
proposition
that
because
an
oath
happens
to
be
framed
in
the
negative
then
there
is
some
supervening
commandment
which
says
that
negative
oaths
per
se
are
objectionable
to
the
constitution.
several
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no
sir.
i
think
that
it
does
not.
i
think
that
it
does
not
as
i
stated
to
this
court,
your
honor,
and
i
trust
that
i'm
on
reasonable
ground,
thought
makes
me
far
less
categorical
in
my
statements
than
appellant
who
challenges
all
oaths
under
any
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
concerned
with
this
case
at
this
time
involving
these
parties.
we
are
not
and
i'm
as
grateful
as
your
honor
is
living
in
the
third
reich
at
this
point
and
we
are
not
faced
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
with
the
circumstance
which
faced
simon
wehre
(ph)
or
some
other
revolutionary
who
is
concerned
with
the
gestapo
or
who
is
concerned
with
the
totalitarian
state.
and
if
your
honor
asks
me
whether
i
would
project
this
oath
into
the
abstract,
i
can
only
tell
your
honor
that
i
trust
that
the
defend
--
parties,
defendant
and
appellees
in
this
case
are
perhaps
in
their
own
way
every
bit
is
committed
to
the
notion
of
individual
liberty
and
freedom
as
are
the
appellants
in
this
particular
cause.
but
i
can't
project
into
some
totalitarian
future
which
i
trust
will
not
descend
upon
us,
and
which
i
trust
will
not
give
rise
to
a
case
before
this
bar.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
i
can't
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
judge
leonard
hand
put
it,
well,
and
it
maybe
very
paradoxical.
as
i
recall
he
said,
“the
government,
any
government,
and
i
assume
he
meant
a
totalitarian
one
juridically
as
well
as
our
government
has
the
right
to
protect
itself
against
revolution
and
any
person
oppressed
by
that
government
who
does
not
have
available
to
him
constitutional
means
of
altering
that
government
has
a
moral
right
to
do
what
he
can
to
alter
it.”
and
i
think
that's
the
everlasting,
living
paradox
with
which
any
man
in
any
state
is
caught.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir,
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
employing
a
perspective
slightly
different
from
the
perspective
in
which
the
appellee's
brief
was
cast
without
abandoning
any
of
the
arguments
in
that
brief,
in
the
next
few
moments
i
just
like
to
take
account
of
appellant's
argument
within
the
somewhat
per
se
context
of
a
three-fold
argument
if
i
may.
the
position
that
the
appellees
going
to
advance
to
the
court
this
afternoon
are
briefly
stated
these.
first,
we
think
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
assuming
and
we
think
to
that
it
was
on
operative
assumption
that
oaths
per
se,
we're
not
concerned
for
the
moment
with
the
content
of
the
oath,
are
constitutionally
legitimate
running
as
they
do,
we
think
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
through
the
very
pith
and
marrow
of
the
american
experience.
secondly,
we
think
the
court
was
correct
in
advancing
that
assumption
to
a
position
that
governmental
employment
as
such
maybe
conditioned
upon
an
oath
under
certain
circumstances
and
we'll
deal
again
with
the
content
of
the
oath
in
just
a
moment.
secondly,
we're
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
court
was
quite
correct
in
upholding
after
certain
judicial
excisions,
the
instant
oath
which
is
now
before
this
court
and
in
the
context
of
that
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
due
process
arguments
advanced
by
the
appellant.
and
then
finally,
i'd
like
to
advance
the
argument
that
the
court
below
was
correct
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
severalability
in
holding
in
effect
that
the
doctrine
is
alive
and
is
well,
and
then
the
case
of
jackson
and
as
well
as
in
the
cramp
case
is
alive,
well
and
resident
within
this
very
chambers.
first
of
all,
your
honors,
we're
going
to
be
somewhat
less
categorical
than
the
appellant.
we
want
to
speak
to
this
case
before
the
bar
at
this
point
and
we
will
paint
with
a
brush
less
broad
than
a
comet's
tail.
we
want
to
take
the
position,
your
honors
as
this
court
knows,
that
article
ii,
section
vii
of
the
constitution
itself
prescribes
an
oath
and
later,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
oath
which
it
does
prescribe
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
far
broader,
far
vaguer
if
you
will,
far
less
specific
than
the
oath
with
which
were
confronted
in
the
instant
case.
article
vi,
clause
ii
of
the
constitution
requires
that
all
executive,
judicial
and
legislative
officers
of
the
united
states
and
the
several
states
must
subscribe
to
an
oath
and
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
the
first
congress
in
1789
precisely
prescribed
an
oath.
this
morning,
i
stood
before
this
court
and
very
proudly
subscribed
to
an
oath
promulgated
by
this
court
and
imposed
upon
me
by
this
court
pursuant
to
rule
v,
an
oath
which
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
was
a
tri-part
tied
oath
was
far
more
expensive,
if
you
will,
far
less
specific
than
the
oath
attendant
to
the
cause
at
bar
at
the
present
time.
in
the
case
of
bond
v.
floyd,
this
court
held
very
categorically
it
seem
to
me
if
somewhat
off
handedly,
“a
legislator
of
course
can
be
required
to
swear
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
a
condition
of
holding
office.
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
state's
contention
that
the
oath
provisions
of
the
united
states
in
georgia
constitutions
do
not
violate
the
first
amendment.”
and
then
finally,
at
page
247
of
lawyers
edition
in
bond
v.
floyd,
“of
course
a
state
may
constitutionally
require
a
note
to
support
the
constitution
from
its
legislators,”
and
then,
as
mr.
rosen
pointed
out
in
the
hosack
case,
in
the
knight
case,
and
the
olson
case
affirmed
by
this
court,
the
so-called
affirmative
mode
of
the
loyalty
oath
was
exacted,
it
was
sustained
and
this
court
affirmed.
in
gilmore
versus
james,
which
was
a
case
that
had
to
do
precisely
with
organizational
membership
and
that
particular
oath
or
affidavit
was
struck
down,
nevertheless,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
affirmative
mode
of
an
oath
as
such
was
hardly
repugnant
to
the
constitution
because
the
constitution
requires
one
in
one
place
and
prescribes
it
in
another
place.
and
then
lastly,
in
the
case
of
stewart
versus
washington
which
again,
is
not
on
point
because
it
dealt
with
subscription
to
title
v
of
the
us
code
was
a
far
more
involved
case
than
the
one
at
bar,
nevertheless
in
dicta,
stewart
versus
washington
the,
court
pointed
out
that
the
oath
in
the
affirmative
mode
was
part
and
parcel
of
our
constitution
and
our
constitutional
experience.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
oath
per
se
is
constitutionally
legitimate
on
at
least
two
grounds.
number
one,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
two
articles,
admits
of
an
oath
and
prescribes
an
oath.
and
then
secondly,
this
court
has
held
and
i
would
cite
the
court
to
the
mitchell
case
and
i
would
cite
the
court
as
well
to
ex
parte
curtis
that
governmental
employment
maybe
conditioned
and
maybe
conditioned
in
such
a
way
that
the
employee
may
claim
an
infringement
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
but
that
the
court
itself
will
then
determine
not
whether
there
has
been
an
infringement
because
in
the
mitchell
case
upholding
the
hatch
act,
the
court
admitted
an
infringement
of
several
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
rights
derivative
there
from,
but
it
will
decide
rather
the
permissibility
or
impermissibility
of
the
extent
of
this
alleged
infringement.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
it
was
unquestionably
done
in
this
case.
the
error
is
unblinkable
your
honor.
i
have
no
knowledge
that
it
has
been
done
elsewhere.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
case
of
error,
omission,
oversight
or
delinquency
and
the
case
of
adams
which
is
you
know
is
to
be
before
this
court
and
various
portions
of
that
record
are
included,
was
a
case
incidentally
where
some
of
the
members
of
the
university
of
florida
staff
were
employed
for
some
substantial
period
of
time
before
they
were
ever
presented
with
an
oath
which
is
very
much
like
knight
versus
the
board
of
regents
pointed
out
if
the
oath
was
adopted
1934
and
i
think
the
knight
case
is
brought
in
1967,
several
years
after
some
members
of
that
faculty
of
the
delphi
had
been
employed
not
presented
with
the
oath.
it
was
a
delinquency
in
this
case
your
honor
and
the
court
moved
very
quickly
to
remedy
that
delinquency
and
to
point
out
as
did
the
board
of
public
education
in
orange
county
after
it
was
notified
by
counsel
from
mrs.
kennel
that
that
portion
of
the
oath
which
this
court
had
dealt
with
in
the
cramp
case
had
no
proper
place
being
submitted
to
mrs.
kennel
and
she
was
under
no
legal
obligation
to
subscribe.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
the
ways
of
a
government
executive
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
they
were
indeed
parties
to
the
case
your
honor.
although,
this
was
not
the
same
school
board
and
not
the
same
superintendent
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
but
there's
no
question
that
that
was
an
error
and
a
delinquency
on
their
part,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no
sir.
no
sir,
that
was
the
point
of
the
question
i
suspect
without
any
knowledge
and
i
have
no
knowledge
that
this
was
adduced
in
the
testimony
below
that
the
impermissible
form
with
the
excise
phrase
was
generally
distributed,
yes
sir.
and
in
fact
in
the
adams
case,
the
court
will
recall
from
those
portions
of
the
record
which
are
included
in
the
appellant's
brief,
there
was
remedial
action
taken
by
the
administration,
admittedly
10
years
after
the
fact
to
withdraw
the
impermissibly
enlarged
oath
and
to
submit
a
revised
oath
with
the
excise
provision
deleted,
yes
sir.
the
position
that
the
appellees
wish
to
take
before
this
court
is
complicated
somewhat
your
honors
by
virtue
of
our
inability
to
follow
this
ariadne
thread
of
the
appellant.
the
appellant
seems
to
take
the
position
that
vagueness
is
applicable
when
a
person
is
a
school
teacher,
but
vagueness
as
a
constitutional
challenge
somehow
is
not
applicable
when
one
is
a
legislator.
to
take
the
position
that
some
of
the
arguments
apply
to
sanitarians,
but
others
don't
seem
to
apply
to
teachers
and
i
confess,
though
this
is
an
admission
which
perhaps
i'm
not
compel
to
make,
that
i'm
not
quite
following
that
particular
argument.
i
am
following
the
argument
of
this
court's
statement
in
bond,
in
the
three
cases
which
it
affirmed
and
with
respect
to
the
oath,
i
took
with
respect
to
the
two
prescribe
oaths
that
government
employment
maybe
conditioned
upon
the
exaction
of
an
oath.
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
right
now
that
i
am
persuative
that
the
state
of
florida
and
then
the
other
state
could
exact
from
a
doctor
who
becomes
an
employee
of
the
state
and
who
takes
the
position
as
an
employee
in
one
of
the
state
hospitals.
an
oath
making
him
disclaim,
if
you
will,
that
he
is
suppose
to
intercept
us,
to
making
disclaim
that
he
is
an
advocate
of
euthanasia
and
its
not
beyond
the
realm
or
by
the
reason
or
experience
that
a
man
who
favors
euthanasia
or
a
man
who
was
opposed
to
dr.
lester's
discoveries
and
who
does
not
believe
in
antiseptic
procedures,
founds
it
upon
either
religious
commitment
or
you
if
will,
political
commitment.
morris
cone
once
said
not
who
--
not
all
who
rave
or
divinely
inspired
and
it
maybe
that
a
man
is
misdirected,
but
nevertheless
feels
he
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
believe
in
euthanasia.
yet,
i
think
that
an
oath
per
se
addressed
to
this
individual
is
most
eminently
reasonable
and
ought
not
to
offend
constitutional
rights.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
there
are
your
honor
and
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
our
position
is
that
there
are
two
belief
clauses
and
i
think
that's
precisely
what
the
appellant
said.
the
appellant
said
that
the
affirmative
mode
of
the
oath
which
reads
as
follows,
“i
do
hear
by
solemnly
swear
that
i
will
support
the
constitution”
is
in
point
of
fact
he
says.
a
belief
oath
and
its
really
a
negative
oath
masquerading
as
an
affirmative
oath.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
the
other
requirement
is
“i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
florida
by
force
and
violence”
and
we
support
that
and
i
should
like
to
cite
to
the
court
at
this
point
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
in
olson
versus
phillips
affirmed
by
this
court
at
397
u.s.
317.
the
olson
oath
was
an
oath
your
honor,
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
colorado.
in
explanation
of
that
oath,
the
olson
case
went
on
to
say
and
i
quote,
“the
present
oath
is
an
affirmation
of
belief
in
organic
law
and
disbelief
in
the
use
of
force
to
overthrow
the
government.”
and
i
think
that's
a
quite
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
you
do
indeed,
your
honor
and
i'm
urging
upon
the
court
the
reasoning
of
the
olson
court
not
the
strict
words
which
i'm
--
which
i
certainly
would
not
claim
that
this
court
adopted
per
se.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
if
the
affirmative
oath
means
anything
to
uphold
the
constitution,
it
seems
to
me
could
quite
reasonably
and
i
think
its
preeminently
reasonable
mean
that
one
of
vows
a
belief
in
organic
law
and
the
infinite
mutability
of
the
constitution
through
the
organic
process
and
the
avowal
simultaneously
a
disbelief
in
the
utilization
of
force
and
violence
to
overthrow
the
government.
now,
the
point
that
we
wish
to
make
in
this
regard
is
simply
this:
no
hearing
procedure
is
prescribed
or
allowed
by
the
constitution
with
respect
to
president
of
the
united
states
nor
with
respect
to
myself
and
my
four
colleagues
who
stood
before
the
bar
this
morning,
nor
is
it
allowed
so
far
as
i
know
to
members
of
the
executive
legislative
and
judicial
departments
of
the
federal
government
of
the
several
states.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
excuse
me,
sir.
you
mean,
it's
authorized
by
the
sixth
amendment?
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
respectfully
i
disagree
on
this
ground.
i
disagree
on
simply
ground
and
i
trust
it's
not
too
simplistic
that
oaths
per
se
are
not
anathematized
by
the
constitution.
the
constitution
is
very
specific
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
precisely.
and
because
oaths
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
certainly
not.
we
wouldn't
urge
that
upon
this
court.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
we
think
is
the
first
order
of
business
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
shelton
and
as
it
pointed
out
before
that
in
abler.
school
room
is
a
very
sensitive
place.
the
minds
of
our
students
are
a
very
sensitive
instruments,
malleable
as
they
should
be
and
the
state
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'm
not
the
quite
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
--
there's
anything
about
the
minds
of
law
school
students
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
it
applies
to
them
indeed
your
honor.
i
should
hope
that
the
minds
of
law
schools
students
are
subject
to
imprint
by
their
professors.
at
least,
it's
been
suggested
to
me.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
at
any
rate,
the
state
does,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
have
a
vital
concern
in
maintaining
the
security
of
the
state
and
the
question
is,
what
can
they
do
in
that
regard?
now,
if
i
have
to
swear
an
oath
and
an
oath
which
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
requires
me,
not
merely
to
uphold
the
constitution
your
honor,
but
an
oath
to
conduct
myself
uprightly
whatever
that
means,
to
draw
upon
the
vagueness
argument
of
the
appellant,
an
oath
to
conduct
myself
according
to
law
whatever
that
means
to
draw
upon
the
scalpel
use
by
the
appellant,
then
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
its
far
more
specific
to
require
in
the
affirmative
and
the
negative
mode,
these
two
avows
of
belief
and
disbelief
and
that's
all
the
state
of
florida
is
doing.
the
question
is,
are
oaths
per
se
anathematized
by
the
constitution
and
the
answer
is
no.
may
the
government
condition
employment
or
office
upon
the
exaction
of
the
oath
and
the
answer
is
sometimes
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
oath.
is
a
hearing
necessary
if
one
requires
an
officer
or
employee
to
swear
that
he
will
uphold
the
constitution.
none
has
provided
the
president,
none
is
provided
me,
none
is
provided
you.
we
think
it's
not
necessary
with
respect
to
an
affirmative
oath.
is
it
vague
to
say
that
one
swears
to
preserve,
to
protect,
and
to
defend
the
constitution
as
the
president
must
according
to
article
ii.
certainly,
it's
far
vaguer
than
saying,
i
don't
believe
in
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
is
it
a
prediction
as
opposed
to
a
promise
because
appellant
asks
this
court
to
invalidate
this
oath
on
the
grounds
that
it
may
well
be
a
mere
prediction.
one
maybe
predicting
when
one
says,
i
do
not
believe
in
the
violent
overthrow,
that
violent
overthrow
will
come
as
opposed
to
promising.
i
should
think
that
this
was
set
to
rest
in
the
dodge
(ph)
case
when
the
court
says,
that
belief
means
a
promise;
not
a
prediction
and
if
were
not
content
with
the
dodge
(ph)
case
in
light
of
subsequent
cases,
then
i
merely
refer
this
court
to
the
oath
prescribed
by
article
ii
which
says,
i
will
execute
and
surely
the
president
is
saying
that
he
promises
to
execute,
not
that
history
will
demonstrate
that
he
did
execute.
the
meaning
of
these
oaths
your
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
test
of
the
constitutionality
of
it.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
most
surely
do
not
sir.
i
see
no
need
for
a
hearing
and
the
very
interesting
argument,
and
i
think
the
correct
argument
made
in
the
smiley
and
olson
cases
is
that
a
hearing
has
to
do
with
the
weighing
and
sifting
and
finding
of
evidence.
it
has
to
do
with
the
confrontation
of
the
accusers
and
it
has
to
do
with
cross
examination,
none
of
which
applies
to
the
instant
situation.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir.
as
i
pointed
out
and
indeed
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
state
has
very
compelling
concern
it
seems
to
me
in
the
beliefs
as
a
spring
to
action.
surely,
we're
not
so
obstructionist
that
we
want
to
be
exceedingly
careful
as
to
belief
that
human
belief
is
a
relevant
to
human
conduct.
and
this
court
has
pointed
out
time
and
again
that
the
state
has
a
vital
concern
in
education.
indeed
in
the
brown
case
versus
the
board
of
education,
it
was
noted
that
education
the
principle
business
today
of
government.
this
court
has
noted
in
shelton
and
tucker
and
earlier
adler
is
concerned
with
the
very
sensitive
minds
of
its
students.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no
sir.
unlike
one
or
two
of
other
cases
with
which
this
court
was
concerned,
principally
the
case
of
the
california
tax
exemption,
there
is
no
weighing
and
sifting,
no
judgmental
element
which
enters
into
this.
and
that
case
is
the
court
recalls,
the
assessor
was
mandated
to
make
factual
determinations.
the
swearing
of
this
oath
or
the
refusal
to
swear
the
oath
is
dispositive
of
the
matter
under
florida
law
and
one
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'll
comment
directly
upon
it
at
this
point
if
i
may
sir.
i
think
its
probably
true
that
one
who
is
engaged
in
espionage
or
one
who
has
an
insidious
purpose
is
not
going
to
scruple
at
either
lying
or
taking
some
other
action
which
will
avoid,
placing
them
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
or
which
will
at
place
him
outside
the
area
in
which
he
would
like
to
find
himself
to
carry
out
his
mission
and
while
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
and
i
should
certainly
be
a
fooling
and
diluting
myself
if
i
were
to
take
any
other
position
that
the
florida
loyalty
oath
like
any
oath
is
not
a
panacea
in
terms
of
security.
and
that
the
florida
loyalty
oath
does
not
assure
the
school
authorities
that
they're
having
present
in
their
classrooms,
competent,
dedicated
loyal
people.
it
is
a
measure
number
one,
which
we
don't
think
is
constitutionally
impermissible
and
therefore,
it
is
measure
as
are
so
many
measures
within
the
broad
discretion
of
the
legislator
of
the
state
of
florida.
and
if
the
legislature
of
the
state
feels
that
this
is
one
important
symbol
and
the
symbol
which
may
have
more
or
less
utilitarian
effect,
then
it
seems
to
me
so
long
as
it
is
constitutionally
permissible,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
florida
and
her
sister
states
must
be
granted
that
leave
to
impose
such
a
symbolic
oath.
and
indeed
we
would
seize
upon
the
question
put
to
counsel
for
appellant,
it
is
in
point
of
fact
a
symbolic
oath
and
we
feel
it
is
a
symbolic
and
it
is
important
to
note
as
was
subscribed
before
this
court
this
morning,
and
as
the
constitution
itself
requires.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
1949,
i
believe
was
the
initial
act
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'm
not
aware
of
any
your
honor,
but
i
certainly
wouldn't
be
surprise
if
there
were
some
kind
of
oath
required.
i'm
not
precisely
aware
of
that
and
perhaps
counsel
for
appellant
can
answer
that
as
he
rises.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes
sir
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
the
same
one,
but
far
more
abundant
because
it
contains
the
provision
which
was
excise
by
this
court
in
cramp
and
then
contained
the
other
provisions
which
were
excise
by
the
court
below
and
we're
not
arguing
about
those
judicial
excisions.
so,
it
was
generally
the
same
oath,
but
it
contained
three
more
provisions
that
it
now
contains
as
it
sits
before
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
have
no
knowledge
your
honor
of
any
persons
being
discharged
other
than
those
who
are
the
parties
to
the
cases
now
before
the
court.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
there
are
several
thousand
teachers
in
the
state.
there
are
many,
many,
many
thousands
of
state
employees.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
oh!
i'm
sorry
sir.
three
in
the
adams
case
and
mrs.
kennel
in
the
instant
case.

four
in
all,
i
think
your
honor.
four
in
all
i
believe.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
should
suspect
that
there
was
but
i
know
of
no
statute
prior
to
1949
and
my
research
didn't
reveal
one.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
they
are
until
the
first
few
years
of
teaching
your
honor,
where
upon
the
gaining
continuing
contracts
and
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
two
or
three
years
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
strongly
suspect
that
they
would
your
honor,
yes,
but
i'm
not
all
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no,
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
precisely
in
the
--
i
think
it
stands
on
the
same
feet
as
the
oath
sworn
before
this
court
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
it
is
not
given
to
me
to
exercise
judicial
interpretation,
but
i
suspect
that
the
oath
which
she
did
take,
has
some
very
real
meaning
to
it
and
i
think
it
involves
a
very
real
commitment
of
belief
as
this
court
stated
in
the
dodge
(ph)
case
and
belief
means
a
promise.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
there
is
no
leeway
in
this
respect
because
it
applies
to
all
state
employees
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
--
of
every
sort
or
variety,
including
the
sanitarian
whom
i
think
occupies
an
extremely
important
place
and
society
and
anyone
who
has
roamed
through
new
york
during
the
garbage
strike
is
acutely
and
the
sensitively
aware
of
that.
and
i
should
think
that
the
state
even
has
a
compelling
interest
in
maintaining
whatever
symbolic
protections
it
can
with
respect
to
the
sanitarian,
who
on
my
scale
of
values
is
not
the
lowly
creature
who
is
below
oath.
he
is
not
below
an
oath
anymore
than
the
teacher
is
above
an
oath
because
again,
the
oath
itself
is
not
anathema
and
secondly
because
this
particular
oath
is
well
within
what
we
think
the
court
has
decided
is
permissible.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
for
university
personnel,
your
honor.
for
public
school
personnel,
it's
what's
called
a
continuing
contract,
meaning
that
after
they've
taught
for
approximately
three
years,
they
then
go
on
a
continuing
contract
and
may
only
be
dismissed
for
cause
and
they
are
procedures
outlined
for
that.
so,
it's
called
continuing
contract
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
schools,
a
tenure
in
the
higher
education
area.
and
let
me
just
fleetingly
refer
to
severability.
this
court
stated
the
rule
in
jackson.
it
was
stated
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
cramp
and
it's
quite
clear
that
we
have
an
affirmative,
the
negative
mode
requiring
in
a
avowal
of
belief
and
avowal
of
disbelief
fundamentally
probably
the
same
of
avowals,
if
you
will,
and
i
don't
think
the
constitution,
and
i
think
the
cases
don't
say
that
the
constitution
anathematizes
a
grammatically
negative
oath
irrespective
of
what
the
meaning
of
it
is.
and
i
should
think
that
this
court
would
not
commit
itself
to
the
proposition
that
because
an
oath
happens
to
be
framed
in
the
negative
then
there
is
some
supervening
commandment
which
says
that
negative
oaths
per
se
are
objectionable
to
the
constitution.
several
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
no
sir.
i
think
that
it
does
not.
i
think
that
it
does
not
as
i
stated
to
this
court,
your
honor,
and
i
trust
that
i'm
on
reasonable
ground,
thought
makes
me
far
less
categorical
in
my
statements
than
appellant
who
challenges
all
oaths
under
any
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
concerned
with
this
case
at
this
time
involving
these
parties.
we
are
not
and
i'm
as
grateful
as
your
honor
is
living
in
the
third
reich
at
this
point
and
we
are
not
faced
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
with
the
circumstance
which
faced
simon
wehre
(ph)
or
some
other
revolutionary
who
is
concerned
with
the
gestapo
or
who
is
concerned
with
the
totalitarian
state.
and
if
your
honor
asks
me
whether
i
would
project
this
oath
into
the
abstract,
i
can
only
tell
your
honor
that
i
trust
that
the
defend
--
parties,
defendant
and
appellees
in
this
case
are
perhaps
in
their
own
way
every
bit
is
committed
to
the
notion
of
individual
liberty
and
freedom
as
are
the
appellants
in
this
particular
cause.
but
i
can't
project
into
some
totalitarian
future
which
i
trust
will
not
descend
upon
us,
and
which
i
trust
will
not
give
rise
to
a
case
before
this
bar.
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
i
can't
--
mr.
stephen
marc
slepin
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
judge
leonard
hand
put
it,
well,
and
it
maybe
very
paradoxical.
as
i
recall
he
said,
“the
government,
any
government,
and
i
assume
he
meant
a
totalitarian
one
juridically
as
well
as
our
government
has
the
right
to
protect
itself
against
revolution
and
any
person
oppressed
by
that
government
who
does
not
have
available
to
him
constitutional
means
of
altering
that
government
has
a
moral
right
to
do
what
he
can
to
alter
it.”
and
i
think
that's
the
everlasting,
living
paradox
with
which
any
man
in
any
state
is
caught.
thank
you,
your
honor.
