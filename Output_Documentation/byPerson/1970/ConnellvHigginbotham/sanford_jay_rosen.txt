mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
representing
a
woman
who
was
ousted
from
her
job
as
a
school
teacher
in
orange
county,
florida
because
she
refused
to
take
a
loyalty
oath.
incredibly,
the
oath
that
was
first
tendered
to
--
to
the
appellant
was
the
duplicate
word
for
word,
but
the
oath
that
was
voided
by
this
court
almost
10
years
ago
in
the
cramp
case.
indeed
both
this
case
and
the
cramp
case
arose
in
orange
county
and
individuals
comprise
in
that
county's
board
of
public
instruction
were
defendants
in
both
cases.
the
court
will
forgive
counsel,
he
hopes
if
he
confesses
to
a
sense
of
déjà
vu.
the
feeling
of
having
been
here
before
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
just
three
years
ago,
counsel
stood
at
the
bar
of
the
court
to
plead
the
whitehill
case
on
behalf
of
another
teacher
who
chaffed
at
the
loyalty
of.
from
cramp
through
whitehill
and
james
versus
gilmore,
on
seven
occasions
in
the
last
decade,
on
relatively
narrow
grounds,
this
court
has
invalidated
all
state
negative
loyalty
oaths
for
public
employees
to
come
before
it.
the
affirmative
or
positive
oaths
have
been
left
standing.
now,
we've
come
full
circle,
for
we
are
back
again
to
consider
the
oath
and
law
that
was
reviewed
by
the
court
in
cramp,
the
first
case
in
this
line.
as
enacted,
the
florida
loyalty
statute
contained
five
operative
phrases,
test
oaths,
we
submit
each
separately
or
all
taken
together.
in
cramp,
this
court
declared
one
of
these
phrases
at
least
invalid.
in
the
present
case,
the
court
below
struck
down
two
more.
over
judge
simpson
dissent
however,
it
declared
severable
and
then
validated
the
remaining
two
phrases.
on
the
surface,
one
is
negative
and
the
other
is
affirmative.
now,
all
teachers
and
all
other
employees
are
officials
of
the
state
of
florida
must
now
swear
an
oath
in
the
following
form.
“that
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
to
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
florida
by
force
or
violence.”
appellant
respectfully
submits
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
your
honor,
we
would
object
if
the
florida
oath
were
to
stop
after
the
first
section.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
justice
stewart,
appellant
requests
that
you
consider
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
which
were
not
had
after
a
full
argument
and
briefing
but
only
on
summary
affirmance
of
decisions
below.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
an
affirmance
of
the
merits
in
three
cases
in
the
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
last
three
years;
knight,
olson
and
hosack.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
your
honor,
i'm
not
here
to
press
the
question
of
whether
an
attorney
maybe
compelled
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
understand
that
question
maybe
before
the
court
right
now
in
three
cases.
however,
i
think
the
case
of
an
attorney
maybe
distinguishable,
maybe
different,
really
different
in
the
case
of
a
school
teacher,
a
garbage
collector,
a
subway
conductor,
a
--
well,
any
number
of
potential
public
employees
of
the
state
of
florida
or
for
that
matter
of
any
other
state.
we
are
submitting
that
indiscriminate
test
oath
of
all
public
employees
is
a
test
oath,
an
unconstitutional
oath
for
various
reasons.
we
could
also
suggest
grounds
upon
which
this
particular
test
oath
could
be
voided
without
the
courts
reaching
that
question.
however,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case
for
that
question
to
be
reached.
but
taking
the
case
of
the
attorney,
mr.
chief
justice,
one
could
suggest
that
an
attorney
coming
to
the
bar
to
operate
within
an
system
of
law
under
a
constitution
might
well,
at
very
least
as
a
symbolic
act
of
fidelity
take
an
oath
support
the
constitution.
whether
or
not
such
an
attorney
would
ever
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
of
course
is
questionable
in
my
mind,
but
if
cause
came
on
subsequent
occasion
to
think
that
the
oath
were
taking
falsely,
we're
not
quite
even
certain
what
that
mean
of
course,
but
we
do
believe
that
the
case
of
an
attorney
would
be
somewhat
different
from
that
of
just
an
ordinary
public
employee.
in
fact
your
honor,
we
make
five
arguments
as
to
the
oaths
in
this
case.
none
of
which
do
turn
on
particular
phrase
at
issue
or
whether
it
is
cast
in
negative
or
affirmative
terms.
we
propose
in
this
argument
to
take
the
high
ground
and
hope
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
time
has
come
at
last
to
address
underlying
question
of
whether
indiscriminate
test
oaths,
regardless
of
how
they
maybe
cast,
invariably
offend
the
constitution.
now,
we
would
make
five
points
in
this
case,
two
of
them
address
the
indiscriminate
test
oaths
or
all
indiscriminate
test
oaths.
the
first
is
that
such
test
oaths
violate
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
second
is
by
operating
automatically
in
an
area
abutting
essential
first
amendment
rights,
all
such
test
oaths
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case
or
of
to
federal
oath,
the
fifth
amendment
for
lack
of
a
hearing.
the
other
three
arguments
we
would
make
pertain
more
specifically
to
the
oaths
in
this
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
on
the
hearing,
your
honor?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
alright.
the
hearing
might
be
on
two
points.
it's
our
submission
that
all
test
oaths
had
within
them
an
element
to
vagueness
and
over
breath.
none
of
them
is
quite
clear.
a
layman
taking
the
oath
and
who
takes
oath
seriously
might
well
wonder
what
the
oath
means.
there's
no
provision
in
the
florida
law
nor
in
most
laws
for
any
clarification
of
the
oath
and
the
case
before
the
court
is
a
particularly
interesting
one
in
this
regard
because
as
the
brief
demonstrates
and
the
record
demonstrates,
this
court
had
in
fact
struck
down
one
provision
in
the
oath
that
was
first
submitted
to
our
client,
to
the
appellant.
now
it
just
so
happened,
the
appellant
went
to
an
attorney
and
was
informed
that
the
oath
that
she
was
given
was
in
firm.
and
then
the
public
--
the
school
board
attempted
to
cure
that
oath
and
we
got
into
a
litigation
posture.
in
the
absence
of
a
hearing
opportunity,
that
clarification
in
this
case
would
never
have
occurred
or
might
never
have
occurred.
in
addition,
if
the
oath
is
it
all
vague
the
clarification
possibility
would
never
occur,
if
the
person
has
conscientious
reasons
to
believe
that
the
oath
is
unclear.
secondly,
a
large
number
of
people
have
conscientious
objections
to
the
taking
of
oaths.
i'm
not
merely
talking
about
whether
they
can
swear
or
affirm,
but
they
conscientiously
scruple
against
taking
oaths.
members
of
the
society
of
friends
for
example,
might
well
not
wish
to
take
any
oath,
members
of
the
seventh
day
adventist
sect.
for
example,
might
well
not
wish
to
take
any
oath
as
this
court
recognized
in
torcaso
i
think.
so,
the
indiscriminate
across
the
board
automatically
operating
test
oath
as
in
this
case
provides
no
opportunity
for
a
person
who
may
have
a
good
constitutional
exception
to
the
oath,
at
least
in
her
case
or
his
in
case
to
assert
that
exception
or
it
provides
absolutely
no
opportunity
for
that
person
to
explain
his
or
her
reasons
for
not
taking
the
oath
and
to
provide
if
that's
necessary
the
kind
of
a
record
to
demonstrate
whether
in
fact
they
are
a
risk
to
the
government
in
an
employment
capacity.
now,
as
i
suggested,
we
will
make
three
other
arguments
and
have
made
them
in
our
brief,
addressed
to
the
oaths
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
first
argument
will
be
that
it
is
illuminated
by
the
florida
supreme
court
on
remanding
the
cramp
case,
each
of
the
phrases,
each
of
oaths
in
this
case
is
unconstitutionally
broad
in
derogation
of
the
first
amendment.
if
not
unconstitutionally
broad,
our
second
specific
argument
would
be
that
each
again
is
illuminated
or
perhaps
obfuscated
is
the
proper
word
by
the
florida
supreme
court
is
unduly
vague
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
and
first
amendments.
and
finally
under
the
florida
tests
of
severability,
given
the
gloss
put
upon
the
oath
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
cramp
on
remand,
any
surviving
provisions
of
the
statute
must
now
fall.
now,
if
your
honors
will,
i'll
take
up
each
of
the
points
in
order.
the
first
point
is
that
test
oaths
generally
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
your
honor
we
did.
it
was
filed.
if
your
honor
desires
a
copy,
i
do
have
an
extra
here.
as
i
was
stating,
test
oaths
a
fortiori
invade
first
amendment
provinces.
even
a
simple
oath
to
support
the
constitution
is
encroaching
upon
a
person's
right
to
believe
or
not
to
believe
in
the
constitution.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
--
that's
an
intriguing
question
one
that
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
and
i
suggest
that
the
answer
would
be
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
now,
i
agree
with
you
and
if
the
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
was
going
to
narrow
the
purview
of
my
argument
by
suggesting
what
i
meant
by
an
indiscriminant
test
oath.
i
do
not
think
that
the
first
amendment
has
amended
article
vi.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
certainly
this
court
in
dictum,
in
bond
versus
floyd
recognized
that
the
state
might
well
require
of
a
state
legislator,
an
oath
that
it
could
not
require
of
a
private
citizen.
now,
it's
important
that
chief
justice
warren
in
speaking
to
the
oath
and
bond
versus
floyd's
used
almost
precisely
those
words.
it
may
require
an
oath
of
a
legislature
that
it
could
not
require
of
a
private
citizen.
our
submission
is
the
person's
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no.
it
might
unconstitutionally
invade
the
first
amendment
rights
of
one
rather
the
other,
even
a
simply
oath
to
affirm
the
constitution.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon?
we
do
not
abandon
our
vagueness
argument
as
to
this
oath.
if
the
court
chooses
to
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh!
i
think
this
oath
would
be
vague
to
anyone
who
took
it,
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
if
this
oath
is
illuminated
by
a
gloss
provided
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
is
controlling
on
the
meaning
of
the
oath
now.
in
cramp
on
remand,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
the
obvious
legislative
purpose
in
enacting
the
subject
statute
was
to
prevent
the
election
or
employment
of
public
officials
and
employees
who
are
knowingly
disloyal
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
to
the
state
of
florida
and
who
subscribed
to
the
doctrine
of
accomplishing
a
change
in
government
by
employment
to
force
or
violence.
we
suggest
the
two
words
in
that
clause
are
unclear,
unconstitutionally
unclear.
we
do
not
know
what
disloyal
means
and
we
do
not
know
what
subscribe
means
as
used
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
florida.
i
took
the
occasion
to
look
up
the
words
subscribe
again
and
i
notice
that
the
first
three
meanings
have
to
do
with
signing
a
writing
document
or
undertaking.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
what's
the
highest
court
of
florida
meant
when
it
used
the
word
subscribe.
i'm
not
sure
how
far
they
meant
to
go
when
they
use
the
word
subscribing.
further,
the
word
disloyal
or
disloyalty
does
confound
me,
that's
as
to
this
oath.
now,
that
gloss
where
not
present,
if
the
florida
law
merely
said
that
all
persons
excepting
office
under
the
laws
of
florida
or
of
any
political
subdivision
must
take
an
oath
to
support
and
uphold
or
to
--
well,
support
and
uphold
will
do,
the
constitutions
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
florida,
then
our
position
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
oath
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
mere
public
employees
not
in
position
of
sensitivity.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
i
may
suggest
first
that,
it
would
be
constitutional
as
the
legislators,
why?
because
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
would
be
constitutional
as
to
executive
officers
in
a
sensitive
post
as
well.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
of
article
vi
and
even
in
the
absence
of
article
vi,
it
might
still
stand.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
policeman
provide
a
tougher
case.
policeman
would
be
closer
to
lawyers
and
if
indeed,
the
oath
would
be
supportable
for
lawyers,
i
imagine
they
might
--
it
might
be
for
policeman.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
not.
i
think
not,
the
oath
and
possibly
not
even
a
policeman.
the
point
being
that
the
main
justification
for
the
oath
aside
from
article
vi
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
do
you
mean
the
precise
oath
that
was
given
to
her
for
the
particular
oath?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
no.
if
she
remained
true
to
her
cause,
she
could
not
become
a
legislator,
but
if
the
oath
were
simple
one
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
she
became
a
legislator?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
under
this
law?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
this
particular
oath?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
you
mean
if
that
were
all
there
was?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
she
could
not
get
relief
from
this
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
what
is
the
difference?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
on
that
point
the
vagueness,
we're
not
pressing
that
particular
point
to
vagueness.
the
point
of
vagueness
we
press
is
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
gloss
on
this
particular
affirmative
oath
when
you're
dealing
with
the
affirmative
oath.
but
as
to
her,
we
would
still
suggest
that
the
affirmative
oath
put
to
a
school
teacher
or
a
sanitation
employee
or
someone
in
that
category
is
an
undue
invasion
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
there
is
no
good
reason
why
the
government
should
require
--
well,
to
start
with
the
sanitation
workers
to
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
can
see
some
reason
why
the
government
might
require
civics
teacher
mr.
chief
justice
to
stand
up
and
say
that
she
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
however,
we
do
not
believe
if
the
government
can
meet
the
burden
of
subordinating
interest
and
substantial
interest
has
been
set
recently
by
this
court
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
which
must
be
met
before
you
can
invade
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
there
are
two
distinctions
i
would
think
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
i
concede
that
i
have
more
trouble
with
the
case
of
lawyers
taking
the
oath
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly
and
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
now,
its
interesting
that
the
rule
of
this
court
until
recently
was
a
rule
that
had
to
be
executed
in
person.
that
is
to
say,
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar
had
to
present
himself
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
personally
take
the
oath
swearing
or
affirm
it.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
originally,
i
believe
there
was
a
difference.
i
think
the
difference
consists
in
two
parts,
well,
one
major
part.
it
seems
to
me
the
oath
to
affirm
the
constitution
is
basically
a
symbolic
oath.
it's
a
public
gesture
of
fidelity
to
the
constitution
to
the
basic
system
of
government
and
of
law,
and
it's
a
useful
symbol
and
tradition
to
have
the
president
of
the
united
states,
for
example,
on
the
occasion
of
his
inauguration
or
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
or
other
high
government
officers
taking
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
constitutions
to
the
basic
document.
i
think
it's
very
useful.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
assume
that
each
man
who
takes
the
oath
for
high
government
office
takes
it
conscientiously
and
believes
he
understands
what
the
oath
means
and
he
intends
to
uphold
and
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
but
in
terms
of
the
basic
values
of
the
society,
yes,
i
think
it
is
basically
symbolic.
i
could
hardly
imagine
that
it
would
be
enforced
through
a
perjury
prosecution
for
example
and
i
do
not
see
the
symbolism
of
having
a
sanitation
worker
or
even
a
teacher
sign
a
piece
of
paper
saying
that
she
will
or
he
will
as
the
cost
of
the
privilege
of
taking
of
our
garbage
or
teaching
our
children
uphold
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
[laughter]
i
don't
mean
to
in
any
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
pejorative
fashion.
i
--
of
course
i
choose
the
sanitation
worker
as
which
strikes
me
to
be
the
most
ludicrous
example
of
the
lack
of
relationship
between
a
function
for
such
an
oath
and
the
oath
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
is
a
school
teacher.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
in
this
case,
this
case
you
can
not
even
worry
about
the
affirmative
oath
question
but
of
course
in
cole
versus
richardson
which
the
court
remanded
last
year,
the
question
has
been
refiled
in
the
--
or
cole
versus
richardson
has
been
refiled
before
the
court
and
the
question
is
being
pressed
upon
the
court
on
a
numerable
occasions.
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
school
teacher.
in
cole
as
i
recall,
we
were
not
--
you
were
not
dealing
with
the
school
teacher.
the
woman
was
a
laboratory
technician
which
if
the
area
of
education
is
one
that
seems
to
give
rise
to
a
reason
for
sensitivity
and
for
the
symbolism
of
the
oath,
well
certainly
a
lab
technician
in
a
biomedical
facility
may
move
away
from
the
school
teacher
area
toward
the
sanitation
worker
area.
but
if
you
move
into
the
school
teacher
area
where
surely
the
reasons
for
giving
the
oath
or
for
requiring
the
oath
may
seem
greater,
you
also
find
your
honors,
that
the
reasons
for
not
requiring
the
oath
are
greater.
and
numerable
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
the
centrality
of
academic
freedom
to
the
first
amendment,
indeed
to
all
essential
democratic
rights
in
our
society.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
in
that
respect.
i
am
both
a
school
teacher
and
a
lawyer
and
i
think
that
if
i
have
to
take
the
oath
as
a
school
teacher,
it
would
bother
me
a
great
deal
more
than
i
have
to
take
the
oath
as
a
lawyer.
i
have
taken
the
oath
as
a
lawyer
of
course,
but
yes,
school
teachers
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
mr.
chief
justice
are
entitled
to
what
appears
at
least
on
my
reading
of
the
recent
decisions
to
be
a
higher
protection
of
the
first
amendment
than
most
of
the
folk
in
our
society
because
of
the
essentiality
of
academic
freedom,
because
of
the
very,
very
tenuous
and
subtle
and
well,
very
fragile
nature
of
the
academic
setting.
our
second
point
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
she
was
either
in
the
first
or
to
the
third
grade
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
we
do
not.
i
can
see
that
that
such
distinctions
can
be
made,
but
we
do
not
believe
they
make
a
difference.
the
basic
function
of
the
oath
is
served
in
neither
occasions.
to
the
extent
that
the
state's
interest
maybe
in
avoiding
indoctrination
of
either
third
graders
or
law
school
students
in
subversive
concepts
or
subversive
ideas
whatever
they
maybe,
i
would
submit
the
state
has
other
means
by
which
it
can
accomplish
that
end
without
requiring
teachers
to
go
to
de
novo
in
some
cases,
ends
of
having
to
subscribe
a
test
oath.
the
second
point
that
we
make
in
terms
of
the
broad-based
unconstitutionality
of
the
indiscriminate
test
oath.
the
oath
given
to
all
people
who
somehow
come
within
the
state's
power
either
by
way
of
employee
or
one
who
requests
a
benefit
is
that
because
of
the
automatic
nature
of
the
disability,
the
first
amendment
rights
are
even
more
greatly
invaded
or
the
danger
to
the
first
amendment
rights
is
even
greater.
therefore,
at
the
very
least
if
such
oaths
or
such
inquiry
can
be
made,
there
must
be
provision
for
hearing
as
there
was
indeed
in
the
new
york
cases,
both
in
adler
and
in
keyishian.
some
provision
for
a
hearing
at
least
whereby
the
oath
or
the
inquiry
can
be
clarified
and
the
applicant
or
the
one
who
is
being
asked
to
subscribe
the
oath
may
in
fact
state
her
reservations.
now,
the
specific
objections
to
the
oath
and
the
statute
in
this
case,
the
oath
of
florida
and
the
statute
of
florida
really
illuminate,
we
feel
the
defects
of
all
test
oaths.
in
the
first
instant
under
the
gloss
provided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
each
of
the
oaths
in
fact
unduly
invades
first
amendment
interests.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
would
not
say
that
mr.
justice
white,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
requiring
all
professors
to
take
loyalty.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
are
they
going
to
ask
all
teachers
that?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
loyalty
oath
at
that
point.
i
think
it
offends
both
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
first
amendment
since
it's
quite
inchoate,
quite
vague
at
that
point.
they
are
asking
him
about
future
intents
and
things
like
that.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
a
fortiori,
you
could
not
ask
him
that.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
that
is
just
a
belief
and
numerable
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
it
that
you
may
not
invade
to
protected
province
of
a
man
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
you
can
always
ask
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
you're
trying
to
make
the
teacher's
situation
look
much
closer
to
the
bar
situation,
i
take
it.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
because
of
the
fragility
of
academic
freedom,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
put
a
greater
protection
around
the
teacher
than
around
the
lawyer,
although
the
lawyer
is
entitled
to
a
great
deal
of
protection.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
believe
he
could.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
when
you're
asking
whether
he's
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony
in
most
instances,
you're
dealing
not
with
first
amendment
activity.
if
he
has
in
fact
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
he
is
a
felon.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
have
more
trouble
with
that
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
anything,
academic
freedom
maybe
a
bit
bigger
than
the
first
amendment
for
the
rest
of
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
[laughter]
except
that
the
gloss
put
upon
the
first
amendment
by
this
court
in
whitehill
and
keyishian
and
other
decisions
has
recognized
the
terribly
critical
first
amendment
part
of
academic
freedom.
my
reading
of
those
decisions
was
that
academic
freedom
was
entitled
to
a
highest
priority
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
and
well,
i
see
that
my
time
is
elapsing
perhaps
i
--
we
will
stand
on
our
brief
for
the
points
in
terms
of
the
actual
unconstitutionality
of
these
specific
provisions.
by
suggesting
in
closing
as
--
i
did
desire
to
quote
something
from
professor
emerson's
recent
book
on
the
system
of
the
freedom
of
expression
which
very
succinctly
demonstrates,
at
least
these
words
can,
the
unduly
vague
broad
and
due
process
violating
character
of
all
indiscriminate
loyalty
oaths.
but
since
i
can't
find
that
particular
piece
of
paper
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
at
page
207
and
208.
in
close
your
honors,
appellant
respectfully
request
this
court
to
declare
the
florida
loyalty
oath
and
statute,
all
of
it
unconstitutional
and
to
use
the
occasion
to
pass
upon
the
indiscriminate
test
oath
as
such.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
representing
a
woman
who
was
ousted
from
her
job
as
a
school
teacher
in
orange
county,
florida
because
she
refused
to
take
a
loyalty
oath.
incredibly,
the
oath
that
was
first
tendered
to
--
to
the
appellant
was
the
duplicate
word
for
word,
but
the
oath
that
was
voided
by
this
court
almost
10
years
ago
in
the
cramp
case.
indeed
both
this
case
and
the
cramp
case
arose
in
orange
county
and
individuals
comprise
in
that
county's
board
of
public
instruction
were
defendants
in
both
cases.
the
court
will
forgive
counsel,
he
hopes
if
he
confesses
to
a
sense
of
déjà
vu.
the
feeling
of
having
been
here
before
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
just
three
years
ago,
counsel
stood
at
the
bar
of
the
court
to
plead
the
whitehill
case
on
behalf
of
another
teacher
who
chaffed
at
the
loyalty
of.
from
cramp
through
whitehill
and
james
versus
gilmore,
on
seven
occasions
in
the
last
decade,
on
relatively
narrow
grounds,
this
court
has
invalidated
all
state
negative
loyalty
oaths
for
public
employees
to
come
before
it.
the
affirmative
or
positive
oaths
have
been
left
standing.
now,
we've
come
full
circle,
for
we
are
back
again
to
consider
the
oath
and
law
that
was
reviewed
by
the
court
in
cramp,
the
first
case
in
this
line.
as
enacted,
the
florida
loyalty
statute
contained
five
operative
phrases,
test
oaths,
we
submit
each
separately
or
all
taken
together.
in
cramp,
this
court
declared
one
of
these
phrases
at
least
invalid.
in
the
present
case,
the
court
below
struck
down
two
more.
over
judge
simpson
dissent
however,
it
declared
severable
and
then
validated
the
remaining
two
phrases.
on
the
surface,
one
is
negative
and
the
other
is
affirmative.
now,
all
teachers
and
all
other
employees
are
officials
of
the
state
of
florida
must
now
swear
an
oath
in
the
following
form.
“that
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
to
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
florida
by
force
or
violence.”
appellant
respectfully
submits
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
your
honor,
we
would
object
if
the
florida
oath
were
to
stop
after
the
first
section.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
justice
stewart,
appellant
requests
that
you
consider
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
which
were
not
had
after
a
full
argument
and
briefing
but
only
on
summary
affirmance
of
decisions
below.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
an
affirmance
of
the
merits
in
three
cases
in
the
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
last
three
years;
knight,
olson
and
hosack.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
your
honor,
i'm
not
here
to
press
the
question
of
whether
an
attorney
maybe
compelled
to
take
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
understand
that
question
maybe
before
the
court
right
now
in
three
cases.
however,
i
think
the
case
of
an
attorney
maybe
distinguishable,
maybe
different,
really
different
in
the
case
of
a
school
teacher,
a
garbage
collector,
a
subway
conductor,
a
--
well,
any
number
of
potential
public
employees
of
the
state
of
florida
or
for
that
matter
of
any
other
state.
we
are
submitting
that
indiscriminate
test
oath
of
all
public
employees
is
a
test
oath,
an
unconstitutional
oath
for
various
reasons.
we
could
also
suggest
grounds
upon
which
this
particular
test
oath
could
be
voided
without
the
courts
reaching
that
question.
however,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case
for
that
question
to
be
reached.
but
taking
the
case
of
the
attorney,
mr.
chief
justice,
one
could
suggest
that
an
attorney
coming
to
the
bar
to
operate
within
an
system
of
law
under
a
constitution
might
well,
at
very
least
as
a
symbolic
act
of
fidelity
take
an
oath
support
the
constitution.
whether
or
not
such
an
attorney
would
ever
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
of
course
is
questionable
in
my
mind,
but
if
cause
came
on
subsequent
occasion
to
think
that
the
oath
were
taking
falsely,
we're
not
quite
even
certain
what
that
mean
of
course,
but
we
do
believe
that
the
case
of
an
attorney
would
be
somewhat
different
from
that
of
just
an
ordinary
public
employee.
in
fact
your
honor,
we
make
five
arguments
as
to
the
oaths
in
this
case.
none
of
which
do
turn
on
particular
phrase
at
issue
or
whether
it
is
cast
in
negative
or
affirmative
terms.
we
propose
in
this
argument
to
take
the
high
ground
and
hope
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
time
has
come
at
last
to
address
underlying
question
of
whether
indiscriminate
test
oaths,
regardless
of
how
they
maybe
cast,
invariably
offend
the
constitution.
now,
we
would
make
five
points
in
this
case,
two
of
them
address
the
indiscriminate
test
oaths
or
all
indiscriminate
test
oaths.
the
first
is
that
such
test
oaths
violate
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
second
is
by
operating
automatically
in
an
area
abutting
essential
first
amendment
rights,
all
such
test
oaths
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case
or
of
to
federal
oath,
the
fifth
amendment
for
lack
of
a
hearing.
the
other
three
arguments
we
would
make
pertain
more
specifically
to
the
oaths
in
this
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
on
the
hearing,
your
honor?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
alright.
the
hearing
might
be
on
two
points.
it's
our
submission
that
all
test
oaths
had
within
them
an
element
to
vagueness
and
over
breath.
none
of
them
is
quite
clear.
a
layman
taking
the
oath
and
who
takes
oath
seriously
might
well
wonder
what
the
oath
means.
there's
no
provision
in
the
florida
law
nor
in
most
laws
for
any
clarification
of
the
oath
and
the
case
before
the
court
is
a
particularly
interesting
one
in
this
regard
because
as
the
brief
demonstrates
and
the
record
demonstrates,
this
court
had
in
fact
struck
down
one
provision
in
the
oath
that
was
first
submitted
to
our
client,
to
the
appellant.
now
it
just
so
happened,
the
appellant
went
to
an
attorney
and
was
informed
that
the
oath
that
she
was
given
was
in
firm.
and
then
the
public
--
the
school
board
attempted
to
cure
that
oath
and
we
got
into
a
litigation
posture.
in
the
absence
of
a
hearing
opportunity,
that
clarification
in
this
case
would
never
have
occurred
or
might
never
have
occurred.
in
addition,
if
the
oath
is
it
all
vague
the
clarification
possibility
would
never
occur,
if
the
person
has
conscientious
reasons
to
believe
that
the
oath
is
unclear.
secondly,
a
large
number
of
people
have
conscientious
objections
to
the
taking
of
oaths.
i'm
not
merely
talking
about
whether
they
can
swear
or
affirm,
but
they
conscientiously
scruple
against
taking
oaths.
members
of
the
society
of
friends
for
example,
might
well
not
wish
to
take
any
oath,
members
of
the
seventh
day
adventist
sect.
for
example,
might
well
not
wish
to
take
any
oath
as
this
court
recognized
in
torcaso
i
think.
so,
the
indiscriminate
across
the
board
automatically
operating
test
oath
as
in
this
case
provides
no
opportunity
for
a
person
who
may
have
a
good
constitutional
exception
to
the
oath,
at
least
in
her
case
or
his
in
case
to
assert
that
exception
or
it
provides
absolutely
no
opportunity
for
that
person
to
explain
his
or
her
reasons
for
not
taking
the
oath
and
to
provide
if
that's
necessary
the
kind
of
a
record
to
demonstrate
whether
in
fact
they
are
a
risk
to
the
government
in
an
employment
capacity.
now,
as
i
suggested,
we
will
make
three
other
arguments
and
have
made
them
in
our
brief,
addressed
to
the
oaths
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
first
argument
will
be
that
it
is
illuminated
by
the
florida
supreme
court
on
remanding
the
cramp
case,
each
of
the
phrases,
each
of
oaths
in
this
case
is
unconstitutionally
broad
in
derogation
of
the
first
amendment.
if
not
unconstitutionally
broad,
our
second
specific
argument
would
be
that
each
again
is
illuminated
or
perhaps
obfuscated
is
the
proper
word
by
the
florida
supreme
court
is
unduly
vague
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
and
first
amendments.
and
finally
under
the
florida
tests
of
severability,
given
the
gloss
put
upon
the
oath
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
cramp
on
remand,
any
surviving
provisions
of
the
statute
must
now
fall.
now,
if
your
honors
will,
i'll
take
up
each
of
the
points
in
order.
the
first
point
is
that
test
oaths
generally
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
your
honor
we
did.
it
was
filed.
if
your
honor
desires
a
copy,
i
do
have
an
extra
here.
as
i
was
stating,
test
oaths
a
fortiori
invade
first
amendment
provinces.
even
a
simple
oath
to
support
the
constitution
is
encroaching
upon
a
person's
right
to
believe
or
not
to
believe
in
the
constitution.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
--
that's
an
intriguing
question
one
that
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
and
i
suggest
that
the
answer
would
be
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
now,
i
agree
with
you
and
if
the
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
was
going
to
narrow
the
purview
of
my
argument
by
suggesting
what
i
meant
by
an
indiscriminant
test
oath.
i
do
not
think
that
the
first
amendment
has
amended
article
vi.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
certainly
this
court
in
dictum,
in
bond
versus
floyd
recognized
that
the
state
might
well
require
of
a
state
legislator,
an
oath
that
it
could
not
require
of
a
private
citizen.
now,
it's
important
that
chief
justice
warren
in
speaking
to
the
oath
and
bond
versus
floyd's
used
almost
precisely
those
words.
it
may
require
an
oath
of
a
legislature
that
it
could
not
require
of
a
private
citizen.
our
submission
is
the
person's
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no.
it
might
unconstitutionally
invade
the
first
amendment
rights
of
one
rather
the
other,
even
a
simply
oath
to
affirm
the
constitution.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon?
we
do
not
abandon
our
vagueness
argument
as
to
this
oath.
if
the
court
chooses
to
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh!
i
think
this
oath
would
be
vague
to
anyone
who
took
it,
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
if
this
oath
is
illuminated
by
a
gloss
provided
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
is
controlling
on
the
meaning
of
the
oath
now.
in
cramp
on
remand,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
the
obvious
legislative
purpose
in
enacting
the
subject
statute
was
to
prevent
the
election
or
employment
of
public
officials
and
employees
who
are
knowingly
disloyal
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
to
the
state
of
florida
and
who
subscribed
to
the
doctrine
of
accomplishing
a
change
in
government
by
employment
to
force
or
violence.
we
suggest
the
two
words
in
that
clause
are
unclear,
unconstitutionally
unclear.
we
do
not
know
what
disloyal
means
and
we
do
not
know
what
subscribe
means
as
used
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
florida.
i
took
the
occasion
to
look
up
the
words
subscribe
again
and
i
notice
that
the
first
three
meanings
have
to
do
with
signing
a
writing
document
or
undertaking.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
what's
the
highest
court
of
florida
meant
when
it
used
the
word
subscribe.
i'm
not
sure
how
far
they
meant
to
go
when
they
use
the
word
subscribing.
further,
the
word
disloyal
or
disloyalty
does
confound
me,
that's
as
to
this
oath.
now,
that
gloss
where
not
present,
if
the
florida
law
merely
said
that
all
persons
excepting
office
under
the
laws
of
florida
or
of
any
political
subdivision
must
take
an
oath
to
support
and
uphold
or
to
--
well,
support
and
uphold
will
do,
the
constitutions
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
florida,
then
our
position
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
oath
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
mere
public
employees
not
in
position
of
sensitivity.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
i
may
suggest
first
that,
it
would
be
constitutional
as
the
legislators,
why?
because
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
would
be
constitutional
as
to
executive
officers
in
a
sensitive
post
as
well.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
of
article
vi
and
even
in
the
absence
of
article
vi,
it
might
still
stand.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
policeman
provide
a
tougher
case.
policeman
would
be
closer
to
lawyers
and
if
indeed,
the
oath
would
be
supportable
for
lawyers,
i
imagine
they
might
--
it
might
be
for
policeman.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
not.
i
think
not,
the
oath
and
possibly
not
even
a
policeman.
the
point
being
that
the
main
justification
for
the
oath
aside
from
article
vi
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
do
you
mean
the
precise
oath
that
was
given
to
her
for
the
particular
oath?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
no.
if
she
remained
true
to
her
cause,
she
could
not
become
a
legislator,
but
if
the
oath
were
simple
one
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
she
became
a
legislator?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
under
this
law?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
this
particular
oath?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
you
mean
if
that
were
all
there
was?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
she
could
not
get
relief
from
this
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
what
is
the
difference?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
on
that
point
the
vagueness,
we're
not
pressing
that
particular
point
to
vagueness.
the
point
of
vagueness
we
press
is
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
gloss
on
this
particular
affirmative
oath
when
you're
dealing
with
the
affirmative
oath.
but
as
to
her,
we
would
still
suggest
that
the
affirmative
oath
put
to
a
school
teacher
or
a
sanitation
employee
or
someone
in
that
category
is
an
undue
invasion
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
there
is
no
good
reason
why
the
government
should
require
--
well,
to
start
with
the
sanitation
workers
to
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
can
see
some
reason
why
the
government
might
require
civics
teacher
mr.
chief
justice
to
stand
up
and
say
that
she
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
however,
we
do
not
believe
if
the
government
can
meet
the
burden
of
subordinating
interest
and
substantial
interest
has
been
set
recently
by
this
court
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
which
must
be
met
before
you
can
invade
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
there
are
two
distinctions
i
would
think
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
i
concede
that
i
have
more
trouble
with
the
case
of
lawyers
taking
the
oath
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly
and
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
now,
its
interesting
that
the
rule
of
this
court
until
recently
was
a
rule
that
had
to
be
executed
in
person.
that
is
to
say,
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar
had
to
present
himself
before
the
bar
of
this
court
and
personally
take
the
oath
swearing
or
affirm
it.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
originally,
i
believe
there
was
a
difference.
i
think
the
difference
consists
in
two
parts,
well,
one
major
part.
it
seems
to
me
the
oath
to
affirm
the
constitution
is
basically
a
symbolic
oath.
it's
a
public
gesture
of
fidelity
to
the
constitution
to
the
basic
system
of
government
and
of
law,
and
it's
a
useful
symbol
and
tradition
to
have
the
president
of
the
united
states,
for
example,
on
the
occasion
of
his
inauguration
or
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
or
other
high
government
officers
taking
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
constitutions
to
the
basic
document.
i
think
it's
very
useful.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
assume
that
each
man
who
takes
the
oath
for
high
government
office
takes
it
conscientiously
and
believes
he
understands
what
the
oath
means
and
he
intends
to
uphold
and
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
but
in
terms
of
the
basic
values
of
the
society,
yes,
i
think
it
is
basically
symbolic.
i
could
hardly
imagine
that
it
would
be
enforced
through
a
perjury
prosecution
for
example
and
i
do
not
see
the
symbolism
of
having
a
sanitation
worker
or
even
a
teacher
sign
a
piece
of
paper
saying
that
she
will
or
he
will
as
the
cost
of
the
privilege
of
taking
of
our
garbage
or
teaching
our
children
uphold
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
[laughter]
i
don't
mean
to
in
any
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
pejorative
fashion.
i
--
of
course
i
choose
the
sanitation
worker
as
which
strikes
me
to
be
the
most
ludicrous
example
of
the
lack
of
relationship
between
a
function
for
such
an
oath
and
the
oath
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
is
a
school
teacher.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
in
this
case,
this
case
you
can
not
even
worry
about
the
affirmative
oath
question
but
of
course
in
cole
versus
richardson
which
the
court
remanded
last
year,
the
question
has
been
refiled
in
the
--
or
cole
versus
richardson
has
been
refiled
before
the
court
and
the
question
is
being
pressed
upon
the
court
on
a
numerable
occasions.
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
school
teacher.
in
cole
as
i
recall,
we
were
not
--
you
were
not
dealing
with
the
school
teacher.
the
woman
was
a
laboratory
technician
which
if
the
area
of
education
is
one
that
seems
to
give
rise
to
a
reason
for
sensitivity
and
for
the
symbolism
of
the
oath,
well
certainly
a
lab
technician
in
a
biomedical
facility
may
move
away
from
the
school
teacher
area
toward
the
sanitation
worker
area.
but
if
you
move
into
the
school
teacher
area
where
surely
the
reasons
for
giving
the
oath
or
for
requiring
the
oath
may
seem
greater,
you
also
find
your
honors,
that
the
reasons
for
not
requiring
the
oath
are
greater.
and
numerable
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
the
centrality
of
academic
freedom
to
the
first
amendment,
indeed
to
all
essential
democratic
rights
in
our
society.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
in
that
respect.
i
am
both
a
school
teacher
and
a
lawyer
and
i
think
that
if
i
have
to
take
the
oath
as
a
school
teacher,
it
would
bother
me
a
great
deal
more
than
i
have
to
take
the
oath
as
a
lawyer.
i
have
taken
the
oath
as
a
lawyer
of
course,
but
yes,
school
teachers
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
mr.
chief
justice
are
entitled
to
what
appears
at
least
on
my
reading
of
the
recent
decisions
to
be
a
higher
protection
of
the
first
amendment
than
most
of
the
folk
in
our
society
because
of
the
essentiality
of
academic
freedom,
because
of
the
very,
very
tenuous
and
subtle
and
well,
very
fragile
nature
of
the
academic
setting.
our
second
point
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
she
was
either
in
the
first
or
to
the
third
grade
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
we
do
not.
i
can
see
that
that
such
distinctions
can
be
made,
but
we
do
not
believe
they
make
a
difference.
the
basic
function
of
the
oath
is
served
in
neither
occasions.
to
the
extent
that
the
state's
interest
maybe
in
avoiding
indoctrination
of
either
third
graders
or
law
school
students
in
subversive
concepts
or
subversive
ideas
whatever
they
maybe,
i
would
submit
the
state
has
other
means
by
which
it
can
accomplish
that
end
without
requiring
teachers
to
go
to
de
novo
in
some
cases,
ends
of
having
to
subscribe
a
test
oath.
the
second
point
that
we
make
in
terms
of
the
broad-based
unconstitutionality
of
the
indiscriminate
test
oath.
the
oath
given
to
all
people
who
somehow
come
within
the
state's
power
either
by
way
of
employee
or
one
who
requests
a
benefit
is
that
because
of
the
automatic
nature
of
the
disability,
the
first
amendment
rights
are
even
more
greatly
invaded
or
the
danger
to
the
first
amendment
rights
is
even
greater.
therefore,
at
the
very
least
if
such
oaths
or
such
inquiry
can
be
made,
there
must
be
provision
for
hearing
as
there
was
indeed
in
the
new
york
cases,
both
in
adler
and
in
keyishian.
some
provision
for
a
hearing
at
least
whereby
the
oath
or
the
inquiry
can
be
clarified
and
the
applicant
or
the
one
who
is
being
asked
to
subscribe
the
oath
may
in
fact
state
her
reservations.
now,
the
specific
objections
to
the
oath
and
the
statute
in
this
case,
the
oath
of
florida
and
the
statute
of
florida
really
illuminate,
we
feel
the
defects
of
all
test
oaths.
in
the
first
instant
under
the
gloss
provided
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
each
of
the
oaths
in
fact
unduly
invades
first
amendment
interests.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
would
not
say
that
mr.
justice
white,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
requiring
all
professors
to
take
loyalty.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
are
they
going
to
ask
all
teachers
that?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
loyalty
oath
at
that
point.
i
think
it
offends
both
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
first
amendment
since
it's
quite
inchoate,
quite
vague
at
that
point.
they
are
asking
him
about
future
intents
and
things
like
that.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
a
fortiori,
you
could
not
ask
him
that.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
that
is
just
a
belief
and
numerable
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
it
that
you
may
not
invade
to
protected
province
of
a
man
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
you
can
always
ask
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
you're
trying
to
make
the
teacher's
situation
look
much
closer
to
the
bar
situation,
i
take
it.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
because
of
the
fragility
of
academic
freedom,
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
to
put
a
greater
protection
around
the
teacher
than
around
the
lawyer,
although
the
lawyer
is
entitled
to
a
great
deal
of
protection.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
believe
he
could.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
when
you're
asking
whether
he's
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony
in
most
instances,
you're
dealing
not
with
first

if
he
has
in
fact
been
convicted
of
a

he
is
a

that
has
no
bearing
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
have
more
trouble
with
that
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
anything,
academic
freedom
maybe
a
bit
bigger
than
the
first
amendment
for
the
rest
of
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
[laughter]
except
that
the
gloss
put
upon
the
first
amendment
by
this
court
in
whitehill
and
keyishian
and
other
decisions
has
recognized
the
terribly
critical
first
amendment
part
of
academic
freedom.
my
reading
of
those
decisions
was
that
academic
freedom
was
entitled
to
a
highest
priority
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
and
well,
i
see
that
my
time
is
elapsing
perhaps
i
--
we
will
stand
on
our
brief
for
the
points
in
terms
of
the
actual
unconstitutionality
of
these
specific
provisions.
by
suggesting
in
closing
as
--
i
did
desire
to
quote
something
from
professor
emerson's
recent
book
on
the
system
of
the
freedom
of
expression
which
very
succinctly
demonstrates,
at
least
these
words
can,
the
unduly
vague
broad
and
due
process
violating
character
of
all
indiscriminate
loyalty
oaths.
but
since
i
can't
find
that
particular
piece
of
paper
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
at
page
207
and
208.
in
close
your
honors,
appellant
respectfully
request
this
court
to
declare
the
florida
loyalty
oath
and
statute,
all
of
it
unconstitutional
and
to
use
the
occasion
to
pass
upon
the
indiscriminate
test
oath
as
such.
thank
you
your
honors.
