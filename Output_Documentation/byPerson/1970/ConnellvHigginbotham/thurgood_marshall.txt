justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
the
first
amendment,
amended
article
vi
which
requires
all
state
judicial
officers,
legislators
and
executive
officers
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
suggest
that
your
brush
is
too
broad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
saying
the
statute
is
too
broad,
i
think
your
arguments
are
little
broad?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'd
be
[voice
overlap]
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
executive
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
of
article
vi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
of
article
vi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
this
petitioner
in
this
case,
would
you
say
did
necessarily
understand
the
oath,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
became
a
legislator,
you
couldn't
give
him
oath,
could
you
or
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
she
get
any
relief
in
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no!
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
she
said
that
i
don't
have
to
take
the
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what's
the
difference
between
her
as
a
legislator
and
her
as
a
teacher,
the
same
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
understanding
of
the
oath
form?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
ask
him,
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
crime
or
felony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
ask
him
as
to
whether
he
ever
been
discharged
from
a
teaching
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
ask
him
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
do
that
and
not
asking
other
questions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
had
been
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
burning
your
draft
card?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
hope
so.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
just
have
great
difficulty
equating
academic
freedom
with
first
amendment.
they
are
a
little
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
it
hadn't
been
adopted
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
those
cases,
they
had
the
protection
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
you
don't
have
that
protection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
it
doesn't
authorize
you
to
require
this
oath
of
a
teacher
and
i
think
that's
the
difference
between
what's
you're
talking
about
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
who,
well
at
least,
i've
never
thought
that.
i've
never
thought
that
because
article
vi
says
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
i
have
to
agree
that
all
oaths
are
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
then
we
get
to
this
case,
is
this
oath
good,
then
i
what
my
belief
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
business
is
that
of
the
state
of
florida
to
what
the
belief
of
a
teacher
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
typical
law
school
students?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
typical
law
school
students?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[voice
overlap]
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
judging
by
the
by
the
law
school
professors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
place
that
[attempt
to
laughter]?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
whole
problem
about
hearing
as
to
the
presidential
oath,
i
don't
know
of
any
elected
president
as
refused
to
take
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
there
should
be
a
hearing
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
teacher
is
on
a
year
by
year
contract
probable
few
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
in
first
two
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
they'd
have
to
take
this
oath
three
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
a
teacher
says
as
of
this
moment,
i
am
not
for
advocating
the
avowal
to
overthrow
the
government
but
i
can't
guarantee
what
my
research
and
study
might
lead
me
to
believe,
would
that
be
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
just
got
to
take
it
that
way
or
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
except,
i
don't
know
about
you
but
i
didn't
take
an
oath
that
i
wouldn't
overthrow
the
government,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
oath
it.
no,
i'm
saying
is
the
oath
a
little
different.
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
with
you
and
i
don't
agree
with
the
other
side
that
it's
just
symbolic.
i
most
certainly
don't
agree
with
that,
but
my
worry
is
that
how
a
teacher
for
example
of
mathematics
has
to
take
an
oath
that
i
will
not
agree
about
to
overthrow
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
--
my
whole
point
is
where
i
mentioned
before
is
no
leeway
in
these
joints
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
justice
thurgood
