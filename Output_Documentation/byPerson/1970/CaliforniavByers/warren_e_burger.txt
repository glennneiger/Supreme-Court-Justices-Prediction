you

chief

the
safe
thing
to
do
all
was
just
to
stop
and
leave
your
name
and
address,
isn't
it?
chief

warren
e.

and
you
get
an

back?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
does
have
overtones
of
the
possibility.
do
you
argue
that
when
you
take
an
automobile
license
you
take
it
upon
certain
conditions
and
if
you
can't
--
if
you
don't
comply
with
those
conditions
you
don't
get
a

chief

e.

mrs.
louise,
one
difference
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

there
is
one
distinction
between
what
justice
black
was
asking
you
about
is
that
robbing
banks
is
inherently
illegal
and
driving
automobiles
is
not.
one
is
licensed
by
the
state
and
the
other
is
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
falls
under
the
category
of
malum
not
in
per
se,
but
malum
in
se
in
the
common
law.
chief

warren
e.

mrs.
renne,
i
think
we
won;t
ask
your
friend
to
take
two
or
three
minutes
now.
we'll
let
you
begin
fresh
after
lunch.[luncheon
break]
mr.
poulos
would
you
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
poulos
would
you
clear
up
why
this
is
more
than
identity.
we'll
perhaps
understand
the
case
better?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
say
if
it
required
you
to
do
more
than
--
no
more
than
identify
yourself
it
would
be
alright?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
that's
the
center
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
only
dealing
with
drivers
now
and
automobiles,
not
with
pedestrians?
chief

warren
e.

where
did
the
supreme
court
of
california
get
this
correlation?
who
said
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
just
pull
it
out
of
the
air
or
it
is
the
correlation,
the
correlation
between
hit
and
run
drivers
in
criminal
activity?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
justice
white
just
asked
you,
does
that
apply
to
both
drivers?
chief

warren
e.
burger
and
the
correlation
is
the
same
as
to
both?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
don't
see
that
they
have
any
basis
for
any
judicial
notice
of
any
correlation
whatsoever
unless
there
was
an
evidence
in
the
case
suggesting
that
some
study
had
been
made,
a
survey
had
been
made
and
this
is
the
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
pure
speculation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
review
of
his
appraisal
of
that
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
change
the
situation
just
a
little
bit
since
we
are
getting
in
the
hypothetical.
suppose
there
is
a
collision
of
two
moving
cars
on
road
and
the
one
in
the
position,
the
posture
of
of
your
client
who
believes
he
is
in
--
has
this
fair
anticipation
of
some
criminal
charge
decides
to
stop.
but,
in
the
meantime
one
of
the
passengers
or
the
driver
of
the
car
has
already
taken
note
of
his
license
number,
but
nevertheless
they
both
stop,
pull
off
the
road.
he
complies
with
the
statute
under
this
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
may
they
use
the
evidence
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
evidence
that
he
stopped
and
that
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
may
they
use
any
evidence
about
this
accident
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
why
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
they
find
that
by
a
fact
finding
in
each
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
compelled
from
him
that
was
not
already
known
the
driver
of
the
other
car,
namely
that
he
was
in
the
automobile
and
that
he
was
driving
and
that
he
had
an
accident?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
if
you
represent
and
you
would
undertake
to
make
the
claim
that,
that's
the
only
way
that
they
found
out
about
him
is
the
reporting,
the
fact
that
he
stopped?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
then
equating,
speaking
his
own
guilt
with
the
fact
that
he
discloses
his
name
and
that
he
was
the
driver
of
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
are
saying
that
then
you
are
not
in
the
kind
of
a
category
that
marchetti
and
grosso
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then,
would
it
be
safe
to
taking
it
from
your
conclusion,
even
though
it
isn't
this
case
that
you
would
agree
that
if
all
you
had
to
do
is
stop
and
leave
your
name,
nothing
else,
just
your
name
or
your
license
number,
that
would
not
be
a
--
present
fifth
amendment
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
why
do
you
say
that
you
make
the
distinction
between
something
which
involves
only
identification,
wouldn't
that
be
more
of
an
identification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
is
--
what
you
are
saying
i
take
it
to
make
sure
i
have
it
correctly
that
if
it
required
every
passenger
in
the
car,
including
the
driver
to
leave
his
name
and
address,
it
would
present
no
fifth
amendment
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
contact
between
two
moving
vehicles
or
one
moving
vehicle
and
a
stationary
vehicle
or
a
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
a
person
who
is
a
passenger
in
the
car
incriminate
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
if
the
statute
requiring
the
passengers,
all
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
there
a
state
interest
in
preserving
the
witnesses
to
accidents
which
are
not
criminal
and
to
criminal
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
not
see,
this
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
as
reaching
a
statute
which
required
that
all
the
passengers
report
the
accident?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
recognize
you
can't
bind
the
supreme
court
of
california,
i
just
wanted
to
get
your
reaction
to
it.
chief

e.

chief

mrs.

is
it
clear

is

that
