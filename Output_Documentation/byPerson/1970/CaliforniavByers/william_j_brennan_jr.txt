justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
gather
your
supreme
court
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
you
did
not
have
to
leave
your
name
and
address.
it
said
only
that,
to
that
extent
the
state's
interest
in
having
the
name
and
address
can
be
satisfied
and
it
accommodated
with
the
privilege
by
simply
denying
the
use
of
the
information,
the
name
and
address
in
any
state
prosecution,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn't
go
quite
so
far
as
we
had
--
we
went
in
marchetti,
grosso?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
recognized
that
the
state
interest
could
be
accommodated
with
the
privilege
by
simply
denying
the
use
of
the
criminal
prosecution
and
yet
requiring
the
personnel
involvement
in
such
an
accident
to
leave
his
name
and
address.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
except
what
--
under
your
state
supreme
court
decision,
the
state
does
get
the
name
and
address,
doesn't
it?
now
what
purpose
do
you
want
to
use
it
for
except
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
the
state
want
the
name
and
address
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
supreme
court
holding
that
affects
that
state
interest,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
then
that
--
it
said
that
the
name
and
address
have
to
given.
now
what
other
purpose
does
state
want
the
address?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
satisfied
in
the
supreme
court
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
where
--
that's
the
crux
of
it
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
want
us
--
as
for
purposes
of
prosecuting
and
convicting
under
the
state
criminal
laws
and
surely
that
implicates
--
