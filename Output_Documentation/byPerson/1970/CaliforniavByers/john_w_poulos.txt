mr.
john
w.
poulos
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
may
please
the
court.
initially,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
three
areas
that
i'm
going
to
discuss,
but
i'm
not
going
to
take
them
up
in
the
order
in
which
i
now
present
them.
the
first,
is
that
there
has
been
a
incomplete
statement
of
the
facts.
secondly,
there
has
been
an
erroneous,
completely
erroneous
characterization
of
california
law
after
the
byers
decision
and
thirdly,
the
point
of
the
implied
waiver,
we've
heard
discussed
here
today
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief.
now,
this
has
been
argued
before
and
was
before
both
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
california
court
of
appeal,
but
i
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
present
my
position
on
the
doctrine
of
the
implied
waver
before
this
court,
because
it
came
before
this
court
the
first
time
in
the
reply
of
brief.
but
i
will
comment,
i
hope
somewhat
extensively
on
that
theory
in
a
moment.
the
underlying
facts
involved
in
this
case
are
really
quite
simple.
they
start
off
this,
byers
was
driving
a
vehicle
down
one
of
this
roads,
the
public
highways
in
the
state
of
california.
he
was
following
a
vehicle
in
front
of
him,
and
while
attempting
to
pass
the
vehicle
in
front,
he
made
what
is
known
as
an
unlawful
pass
or
unsafe
pass
to
the
left,
a
violation
of
california
vehicle
code
section
in
question.
as
a
result
of
that
failure
to
make
a
pace
--
a
safe
pass
to
the
left,
there
was
a
collision.
the
collision
caused
property
damage
and
the
property
damage
which
was
caused
as
result
of
that
accident,
is
the
property
damage
that
triggered
the
hit
and
run
statute
here
in
question,
california
vehicle
code,
section
2002
(a).
now,
at
the
trial,
in
the
prohibition
proceedings
there
was
indeed
a
stipulation
to
that
effect.
there
was
also
a
finding,
in
the
court's
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
in
connection
with
the
prohibition
proceeding,
indicating
that
indeed
was
the
fact.
and
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
of
california
can
by
the
use
of
the
hit
and
run
statute
force
a
man
to
make
a
statement
which
would
incriminate
himself
for
indeed,
it
was
criminal
action
on
the
part
of
byers
which
triggered
the
reporting
requirement
of
the
hit
and
run
statute.
every
california
case
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
forced
him
by
virtue
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
for
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it
would
have
forced.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
and
that’s
precisely
what
he
did
to,
he
did
not
comply
with
the
statute,
raising
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
action
was
then
filed
two
days
later
in
the
justice
court,
simply
two
days
after
the
accident
there
was
a
complaint
filed
in
the
justice
court
alleging
a
violation
of
the
safe
pass
statute
and
also
a
violation
which
is
incidentally
vehicle
code
section
21750,
and
in
a
count
two
the
violation
of
the
california
hit
and
run
provision,
a
demur
was
interposed
and
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
i
would
have
to
speculate
of
the
record.
on
the
record
itself,
it
does
not
appear,
but
there
are
million
of
ways
of
finding
out
who
is
driving
an
automobile
other
than
compelling
it
out
of
his
own
mouth.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
like
the
license
plates.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
we
are
forced
to
drive
automobiles
with
license
plates.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
that’s
correct
and
i
am
going
to
get
back
to
that
point
in
a
minute
is
the
reason
that
i
feel
that,
that
is
true.
every
california
court
from
the
superior
court
to
the
court
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
held
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
only
argument
is
that
the
superior
court
said,
i
am
reading
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
for
as
you
recognize
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes
and
leary
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time
of
the
prohibition
proceedings
in
the
california
superior
court.
at
that
point,
the
court
said
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
was
a
complete
defense.
there
was
an
appeal,
the
appeal
went
to
the
court
of
appeal
of
california,
the
only
difference
really
between
the
decision
of
the
superior
court
and
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
was
that
the
california
court
of
appeal
seized
upon
the
concept
of
use
restrictions.
now
the
concept
of
use
restrictions
was
not
even
argued
before
the
california
court
of
appeal
in
any
kind
of
meaningful
sense.
it
wasn’t
raised
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
only
collaterally
touched
upon.
the
decision
came
down,
using
rather
vague
terms,
the
reference
to
the
court
of
appeal
citation
is
found
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
exact
citations
skips
of
my
mind
at
the
moment,
but
if
the
court
is
to
look
at
that
decision,
you
see
that
the
use
restriction
concept
really
did
at
that
point,
give
someone
a
fear
of
the
so
called
immunity
bath.
for
that
reason
both
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
the
counsel
for
the
respondent,
petitioned
the
supreme
court.
there
was
a
dual
reason
behind
the
respondent.
it
was
sought
to
be
urged
a
concept
of
fairness,
but
if
this
was
indeed
a
new
concept
of
--
in
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state
of
california,
namely
the
creation
of
use
restrictions
then
he
should
not
be
criminally
punished
for
having
agreed
with
all
of
the
members
of
the
california
courts
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
applicable.
the
court
granted
the
petition
for
hearing
and
in
fact
it
granted
both
petitions
for
hearing.
there
is
quoted
in
the
reply
brief
what
appears
to
be
a
concession
on
my
part.
i
want
to
place
that
concession
in
proper
context
for
i
do
not
concede
now
that
it
is
a
concession.
if
the
court
compares
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeal
decision
you
will
see
why
i
made
the
statements
in
the
petition
for
a
hearing
before
the
california
supreme
court
as
broadly
as
i
did.
but
the
issue
of
the
use
restrictions
of
course
was
one
of
the
main
issues
before
the
california
supreme
court
and
it
was
fully
argued.
the
california
supreme
court’s
decision
in
the
case
is
substantially
different
than
the
use
restriction
concept
used
by
the
court
of
appeal
below.
at
this
point,
the
california
supreme
court
created
a
limited
concept
of
use
restriction.
the
court
clearly
states
in
that
case
that
it
is
only
the
information
which
is
procured
as
a
result
of
the
compliance
with
the
hit
and
run
statute
which
is
--
which
cannot
be
used.
there
is
no
concept
of
an
immunity
bath
used
by
the
california
supreme
court.
the
language
is
in
three
or
four
different
places
in
the
opinion
clearly
indicating
that
the
only
thing
that
is
within
the
use
restriction
is
this
concept
of
the
information
actually
compelled.
now,
there
are
two
california
court
of
appeal
cases
subsequent
to
byers
which
clearly
shows
that
byers
has
not
produced
that
immunity
bath
in
california
that
the
attorney
general
would
have
you
believe,
simply
is
not
so.
the
first
citation
is
found
in
both,
it
was
first
found
in
my
brief,
the
respondent's
brief
and
later
it
appears
on
the
reply
brief,
it's
bailey
versus
superior
court
of
ventura
and
its
4
cal.
app.
3d
522.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
4
cal.
app.
3d
522,
84
cal.
rptr.
436.
now,
we
were
not
belaboring
that
case.
that
is
a
case
that
came
up
after
the
decision
in
byers.
it
was
a
case
dealing
with
section
2001,
rather
than
2002
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
the
difference
being
2001
is
that
personal
injury
hit
and
run
statute,
2002
is
the
property
damage
hit
and
run
statute.
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
and
the
reason
i
have
pointed
out
that
in
the
brief
was
not
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
reporting
requirement.
for
both
the
statutes
require
you
to
stop
and
to
characterize
yourself,
if
you
will,
as
being
the
driver
of
the
adverse
vehicle
and
in
that
sense
they
are
both
self-incriminating.
for
under
the
facts
of
this
case
for
example,
if
byers
had
indeed
stopped
and
had
characterized
himself
as
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
who
had
sideswiped
the
other
automobile,
he
would
have
been
supplying
the
prosecution
with
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
plainly
and
simply
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
pardon
me?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well
that
isn't
identity.
i
think
that's
the
problem
that
we
have
been
running
through
in
this
case.
this
is
not
an
identity
case.
i
think
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
white
clearly
shows
that
it
is
not,
but
let
me
read
you
from
another
california
case
for
just
a
moment.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
your
honor
and
that's
why
i
want
to
cite
from
this
case
before
you.
a
mere
identity
case
is
a
case
in
which
a
citizen
is
--
for
example,
a
citizen
walking
down
the
street
is
stopped
by
the
authorities
and
asked,
what
is
your
name?
there
are
no
circumstances
requiring
him
to
characterize
himself.
he
doesn't
say
i
am
driver
of
a
vehicle
who
has
just
violated
the
vehicle
code
or
i
am
not
a
burglar
or
a
murderer
or
a
speeder,
nothing
like
that
is
required.
but,
the
vehicle
code
section,
the
herein
question
does
require
you
to
do
that.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
of
course,
that
this
doesn't
reach
that
point.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
think
that
if
you
were
simply
walking
down
the
street
and
there
was
only
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
this
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think,
you
couldn't
require
constitutionally
i
submit,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
a
mere
identity.
under
the
facts
of
this
case
because
it
isn't
the
fellow
walking
down,
he
is
in
suspicious
circumstances.
the
california
supreme
court
specially
found
that.
they
said
there
was
a
substantial
correlation
between
being
a
driver
involved
in
an
accident
and
have
contemporaneously
violated
one
or
more
sections
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
equated
but
nor
has
this
court
ever
required
an
equation.
there
--
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
substantial
correlation
and
the
california
supreme
court
found
that
substantial
correlation
in
almost
words,
i
am
not
purporting
to
quote
but
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
no.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
there
is
complete
correlation
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
agree
with
that
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
--
that
is
argued,
that
position
really
is
argued
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
this
case
even,
even
goes
beyond
that
point.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
the
violation
of
vehicle
code
section
21750
which
was
failure
to
pass
to
the
left
at
a
safe
distance.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
that
isn't.
people
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
your
honor,
may
i
read
for
you
how
the
california
courts
have
construed
that
section.
the
california
courts
getting
back
to
this
case
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
your
honor,
but
i
am
trying
to
dispel
any
idea
that
this
is
just
simply
an
identification
case,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
don't
think
you
do.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
you
are
in
the
situation
where
the
statute
requires
you
to
--
if
you
are
the
driver
of
a
vehicle.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
if
you
put
it
that
way,
no.
but,
i
would
again
like
to
refer
to
this
case.
it
says
thus
under
the
facts
peculiar
to
this
case,
we
find
no
error
in
the
court's
instructions
that
to
comply
with
section
2001,
now
this
is
the
personal
injury,
but
the
wording,
the
relevant
wording
is
exactly
the
same.
defendant
was
under
a
duty
not
only
to
identify
himself
as
he
did,
but
also
to
identify
himself
as
the
driver
of
a
vehicle
involved
in
the
accident.
so
that
it
is
not
simply
an
identity
case,
but
it
is
a
case
where
you
require
the
defendant
to
characterize
himself
vis-vis
a
burglar,
vis-a-vis
a
person
who
has
been
the
driver
of
an
offending
vehicle.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
would
venture
a
guess
that
it
is
most
cases.
in
most
cases,
there
is
no
doubt
a
high
correlation
between
being
a
driver
in
the
accident,
being
the
driver
involved
in
an
accident
and
a
violation
of
one
or
more
sections
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
the
california
supreme
court
so
found
and
certainly
it's
in
an
admirable
position
to
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
of
course,
you
really
wouldn't
want
it,
you
don't
need
one,
because
the
operation
of
this
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
there
is
a
certain
genius
about
this
decision
and
the
genius
is
this,
that
it
preserves
exactly
the
states
interest
in
securing
the
information.
if
there
has
not
been
the
contemporaneous
violation
of
another
code
section,
there
is
compliance,
there
is
no
need
to
impose,
use
restrictions,
because
they
are
not
needed.
there
hasn't
been
any
self-incrimination.
but
if
in
fact,
there
has
been
and
the
court
says
there
is
this
high
correlation
reaching
enabling
the
court
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination
involved
regardless
of
the
facts,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
byers
in
fact
did
the
particular
act.
there
is
the
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
so
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
--
and
it
gives
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
is
indeed
a
high
correlation
in
the
state
of
california
between
--
between
being
involved
in
an
accident
which
is
what
they
said.
being
involved
in
an
accident
and
there
being
a
substantial
correlation
between
that
and
having
violated
one
or
more
contemporary
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
it
certainly
would
apply
to
both
drivers.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
no.
all
you
are
telling
me
that
in
a
two-party
case,
one
may
or
may
not.
now,
we
don't
know,
that
--
you
can't
infer
that
there
is
a
50%
probability.
we
all
were
familiar
with
instances
in
which
both
vehicles
indeed
have
been
at
fault,
that's
not
uncommon.
in
fact,
that
maybe
more
common
than
the
situation
in
which
there
is
one
at
fault.
but
i
suspect
that
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
california
supreme
court
is
in
a
much
better
position
to
assess
the
working
of
those
rules
in
california
than
as
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
don't
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
we
call
things
pure
speculation
and
sometimes
when
we
don't
understand
exactly
why
the
court
did
what
it
did.
we
have
things
called
policy
facts.
every
rule
of
law
is
based
upon
a
particular
outlook
on
the
universe
and
when
we
are
litigating
that
particular
fact,
we
have
a
tendency
to
say
well
or
we
do
say
that
the
facts
--
that
the
facts
supporting
that
legal
or
supporting
that
conclusion
have
to
be
in
the
record.
but,
that
isn't
the
kind
of
a
fact
that
is
normally
litigated.
that's
what
we
would
normally
refer
to
as
a
policy
fact,
a
fact
that
the
court
is
in
a
position
to
know
and
i
submit
that,
that's
a
proper
function
of
the
judicial
process.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
he
is
in
--
depending
in
california
on
a
number
of
things,
if
the
accident
cause
damage
more
than
$200.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
he
has
an
obligation
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
but
he
can
claim.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
he
is
going
80
miles
an
hour.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
oh!
oh
no,
i
am
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
fellow
that's
parked
has
an
obligation
to
report.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
it's
technically
i
believe
unless
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
exactly.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
precisely.
now
you
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
is
there
any
review?
well
you
get
it
in
--
you
got
it
in
this
case,
namely
there
is
a
criminal
charge
filed
against
him
and
there
is
a
determination
judicially
as
to
whether
or
not
the
privilege
applied.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
which
evidence?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
the
evidence
from
the
license
plate?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
they
may
use
all
evidence.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
other
than
the
evidence
that
was
compelled
from
him
by
virtue
of
the
hit
and
run
statute.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
the
statute
tells
you
very
clearly
what
is
compelled
and
what
is
not
and
the
court
looks
and
that's
really
the
holding
of
the
bailey
case
and
of
this
other
case
that
i
--
there
are
two
other
cases
or
one
other
case
that
i
think
the
court
really
ought
to
look
at.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
the
touchstone
of
the
fifth
amendment
isn't,
isn't
what
--
isn't,
you
can
only
incriminate
yourself
if
no
one
else
knows.
your
honor
the
touchstone
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
it
can't
come
from
my
mouth.
if
i
were
to
rob
someone
with
a
gun
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
one
could
make
that
claim,
but
as
the
court
will
see
from
these
subsequent
california
cases
the
claim
will
not
be
heeded,
because
they
are
in
a
situation
where
you
can
constitutionally
require
the
fellow
to
stop,
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
the
bailey
case
says,
you
can
compel
him
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident,
you
can
compel
him
to
render
assistance
to
the
injured
party,
but
you
may
not
compel
him
to
speak
his
own
guilt,
which
in
essence
is
what
the
statute
requires.
now
that
they
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
which
the
california
supreme
court
says
is
that
he
of
course,
under
the
facts
of
our
case,
there
was
no
question.
he
knew
that
if
he
characterized
himself
as
the
driver
of
that
vehicle,
he
would
be
admitting
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crimes,
no
question
about
that
under
the
facts
of
our
case.
he
was
prosecuted
for
it.
there
was
no
question
that
he
did
violate
21750,
and
if
he
did
stop
and
did
give
the
information
he
would
be
incriminating
himself.
now
it
is
the
hypothetical
person,
the
person
who
is
just
going
down
the
road,
who
would
also
come
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
i
assume,
under
a
theory
that
there
is
such
a
substantial
correlation
that
the
statute
is
aimed
to
the
select
group
of
people
inherently
suspected
of
crime
because
of
the
substantial
correlation,
but
that's
really
not
our
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
think
we
are
distinctly
in
that
category
of
case.
the
distinction
being
here
that
there
is
--
that
the
court
found
that
there
was
this
substantial
correlation.
finding
the
substantial
correlation,
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
this
case
from
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes
and
leary.
one
could
--
the
attorney
general
argues
that
there
has
been
some
kind
of
a
new
standard
applied.
these
are
magic
words.
we
don't
decide
cases
upon
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
incants
(ph)
the
right
formula
the
purpose
of
that
formula
is
an
order
to
determine
that
there
is
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination
and
that
there
was
in
this
case.
well,
i
have
only
a
short
period
of
time
left
and
i
wanted
to
talk
for
a
moment
about
this
doctrine
of
implied
waiver.
i
don't
think
that
doctrine
of
implied
waiver
raises
a
federal
question
before
this
court.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
this
court,
i
am
assuming
were
recognized
but
the
doctrine
of
implied
waiver
is
a
legal
doctrine,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts,
isn't
a
factual
thing
at
all.
it's
a
legal
fiction
and
the
effect
of
the
legal
fiction
is
to
create
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
when
you
say
someone
is
impliedly
waived
to
something
that
is
really
in
effect
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
the
substantive
rule
and
law
in
california,
is
for
the
california
courts
or
the
california
legislature
to
decide.
it
only
would
become
a
federal
question
if
and
only
if
the
courts
first
decided
that
there
was
in
fact
such
an
implied
waiver,
then
the
constitutional
issue
would
attach,
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
this
was
constitutionally
permissible.
but
under
this
case,
all
of
the
courts,
the
court
of
appeal
expressly
refused
to
find
implied
waiver
here.
there
is
no
basis
for
it
in
either
a
california
statute
or
a
california
case
law.
secondly,
the
california
supreme
court
said
the
same
thing.
they
called
it
“unattainable”
and
again,
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
bailey
case
has
held
the
same
thing.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
idea
of
implied
waiver
presents
this
court
with
any
federal
question
in
this
case.
it's
really
a
red
herring.
again
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
in
a
license
revocation
proceeding?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
that's
a
difficult
question.
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
logically
would
be
yes,
and
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
no.
but
you
know
this
court
has
said
for
example
in
garrity
and
broderick,
and
it's
even
been
applied
in
cases
of
the
private
forfeiture
of
property.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
really
don't
see
that
as
the
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does.
i'm
expressing
doubt
about
that
case.
that
isn't
our
case,
and
i
can
see
competing
interests
where
one
classically
might
say
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
doesn't
apply
in
that
kind
of
situation,
but
the
reasoning
would
be
quite
different.
the
reasoning
would
be
this
that
that
goes
to
the
license
which
permitted
you
to
drive
in
the
first
place
and
it's
quite
different
really
to
say
that
a
state
couldn't
use
it
in
the
license
revocation
proceeding
then
it
is
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
yes,
but
that's
a
little
different.
i
suspect
the
california
court
might,
your
honor
reach
that
result
of
implied
waiver
in
that
kind
of
a
revocation
hearing,
but,
you
know,
that
i
could
see
the
court
legitimately
doing
that.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no.
but,
that
doesn't
meet
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes,
and
leary.
that's
the
basic
philosophy
behind
the
fifth
amendment,
the
powers
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
hoffman
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
the
hoffman
versus
the
united
states
case
followed,
and
malloy
versus
hogan,
there's
an
innumerable
--
well
there's
a
complete
line
of
cases,
using
the
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
test.
yes,
indeed
they
supplied
him,
or
the
sheriff
went
to
the
hypothetical
required
him
to
supply
evidence
which
will
provide
the
prosecution
with
the
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
since
it's
permitted.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
see
none,
and
that's
why
i
think
there's
a
whole
section
in
our
brief
saying,
we
don't
need
the
marchetti,
grosso,
and
haynes
line
of
cases,
but
this
is
a
patent
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
under
prior
case
law.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
about
the
license
tags?
i
think
that
the
state
can
require
a
vehicle
to
have
license
tags.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
that
doesn't,
yeah
on
its
face
the
first
significant
distinction
is
simply
this.
there
is
never
there
a
requirement
of
testimonial
compulsion
which
has
been
this
court's,
one
of
its
touchstones
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
fifth
amendment
does
apply.
this
is
a
case
--
the
case
at
bar
is
one
of
testimonial
compulsion.
the
case
that
you
propose
is
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
because
i
don't
think
that
presents
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
you
have
the
accident.
i
think
is
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
maybe
by
the
fact
that
you
give
me
your
address,
you'll
be
a
better
driver.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
because
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
there
is
still
a
crucial
difference.
neither
instances
of
your
hypothetical
require
anyone
to
characterize
himself.
you
aren't
saying
to
the
police
authorities,
i
was
the
driver.
that
is
a
case
of
identity
where
you
are
talking
about
the
license
plate
numbers
and
that's
why
i
thought
it
was
crucial
for
us
to
explore
that
from
the
first.
there
is
that
crucial
distinction
between
an
identification
requirement
and
one
which
requires
you
really
to
characterize
yourself
within
a
criminal
context.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
think
that
presents
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
someone
who
is
--
if
it
required
everyone
who
was
involved
in
the
accident,
the
drivers,
the
riders,
everyone
who
were
involved
in
the
broad
sense
and
whether
it
was
a
driver
or
a
rider
or
a
witness
to
give
his
name
and
address.
i
think
that
is
a
substantially
different
problem
than
we
have
before
us.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
(inaudible)
only
to
automobile
accidents.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
think
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
problem
there.
i
don't
think
it's
of
the
magnitude
that
the
problem
we
have
discussed,
it's
quite
distinguishable.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
he
does
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
it
really
is
the
scope
of
the
inquiry.
if
you
can
get
enough
people
in,
so
that
it's
so-called
neutral
on
its
face
which
was
one
of
the
problems
in
the
sullivan
case.
if
it's
--
it
applies
to
so
many
people
outside
of
a
criminal
context,
then
you
see,
you'll
begin
to
run
into
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
but
that's
precisely
why
the
state
of
california
in
this
case
used
the
use-restriction
doctrine.
they
said
that
we
recognize
our
interest
in
having
that
information,
but
we
recognize
as
illegitimate.
the
use
of
that
information
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
that
again
is
the
genius
of
the
the
use-restriction
device.
the
court
says,
i
mean
the
california,
all
--
the
california
court
of
appeal
and
california
supreme
court
both
say
that
with
the
use
restriction
device,
we
allow
the
decision
--
we
allow
the
state
to
get
their
legitimate
information.
but
we
do
not
permit
the
state
to
use
that
as
punishment.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
this
--
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case
it
would
litigated
--
it
would
have
to
be
litigated.
i
am
not
sure
at
this
point
that
i
would
say
that
it
was
completely
divested
of
any
fifth
amendment
problem,
but
it
is
a
substantially
different
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
nothing.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
nothing
and
the
reason
--
i
think
this
case
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
--
is
completely
consistent
with
the
sullivan
rule
because
during
the
course
of
the
sullivan
decision,
this
court
said,
in
essence
and
i
am
not
quoting,
but
the
court
said,
you
cannot
refuse
to
file
the
income
tax
return
over
the
blanket
concept
that
to
do
so
will
incriminate
yourself.
but
you
may
make
specific
objection
in
that
return
to
a
specific
question
which
incriminates
you
and
that
is
completely
consistent
with
what
we
are
doing
in
the
byers
case.
it's
a
much
easier
case
than
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes.
in
this
case,
we
come
exactly
within
the
purview
of
what
was
done
in
sullivan.
for
in
this
case,
the
only
that
was
asked
was
self-incriminating.
that
was
not
true
in
sullivan,
although
the
sullivan
court
did
recognize,
speaking
to
mr.
justice
holmes,
did
recognize
that
if
the
specific
question
was
put
to
you
and
indeed
was
self-incriminating,
you
could
claim
it
in
the
return.
i
see
that
this
case
does
nothing
to
sullivan.
in
fact,
i
have
cited
sullivan
in
the
brief
in
support
of
my
contention.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
may
please
the
court.
initially,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
three
areas
that
i'm
going
to
discuss,
but
i'm
not
going
to
take
them
up
in
the
order
in
which
i
now
present
them.
the
first,
is
that
there
has
been
a
incomplete
statement
of
the
facts.
secondly,
there
has
been
an
erroneous,
completely
erroneous
characterization
of
california
law
after
the
byers
decision
and
thirdly,
the
point
of
the
implied
waiver,
we've
heard
discussed
here
today
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief.
now,
this
has
been
argued
before
and
was
before
both
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
california
court
of
appeal,
but
i
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
present
my
position
on
the
doctrine
of
the
implied
waver
before
this
court,
because
it
came
before
this
court
the
first
time
in
the
reply
of
brief.
but
i
will
comment,
i
hope
somewhat
extensively
on
that
theory
in
a
moment.
the
underlying
facts
involved
in
this
case
are
really
quite
simple.
they
start
off
this,
byers
was
driving
a
vehicle
down
one
of
this
roads,
the
public
highways
in
the
state
of
california.
he
was
following
a
vehicle
in
front
of
him,
and
while
attempting
to
pass
the
vehicle
in
front,
he
made
what
is
known
as
an
unlawful
pass
or
unsafe
pass
to
the
left,
a
violation
of
california
vehicle
code
section
in
question.
as
a
result
of
that
failure
to
make
a
pace
--
a
safe
pass
to
the
left,
there
was
a
collision.
the
collision
caused
property
damage
and
the
property
damage
which
was
caused
as
result
of
that
accident,
is
the
property
damage
that
triggered
the
hit
and
run
statute
here
in
question,
california
vehicle
code,
section
2002
(a).
now,
at
the
trial,
in
the
prohibition
proceedings
there
was
indeed
a
stipulation
to
that
effect.
there
was
also
a
finding,
in
the
court's
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
in
connection
with
the
prohibition
proceeding,
indicating
that
indeed
was
the
fact.
and
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
of
california
can
by
the
use
of
the
hit
and
run
statute
force
a
man
to
make
a
statement
which
would
incriminate
himself
for
indeed,
it
was
criminal
action
on
the
part
of
byers
which
triggered
the
reporting
requirement
of
the
hit
and
run
statute.
every
california
case
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
forced
him
by
virtue
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
for
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it
would
have
forced.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
and
that’s
precisely
what
he
did
to,
he
did
not
comply
with
the
statute,
raising
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
action
was
then
filed
two
days
later
in
the
justice
court,
simply
two
days
after
the
accident
there
was
a
complaint
filed
in
the
justice
court
alleging
a
violation
of
the
safe
pass
statute
and
also
a
violation
which
is
incidentally
vehicle
code
section
21750,
and
in
a
count
two
the
violation
of
the
california
hit
and
run
provision,
a
demur
was
interposed
and
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
i
would
have
to
speculate
of
the
record.
on
the
record
itself,
it
does
not
appear,
but
there
are
million
of
ways
of
finding
out
who
is
driving
an
automobile
other
than
compelling
it
out
of
his
own
mouth.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
like
the
license
plates.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
we
are
forced
to
drive
automobiles
with
license
plates.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
that’s
correct
and
i
am
going
to
get
back
to
that
point
in
a
minute
is
the
reason
that
i
feel
that,
that
is
true.
every
california
court
from
the
superior
court
to
the
court
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
held
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
only
argument
is
that
the
superior
court
said,
i
am
reading
albertson
versus
subversive
activities
control
board
for
as
you
recognize
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes
and
leary
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time
of
the
prohibition
proceedings
in
the
california
superior
court.
at
that
point,
the
court
said
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
was
a
complete
defense.
there
was
an
appeal,
the
appeal
went
to
the
court
of
appeal
of
california,
the
only
difference
really
between
the
decision
of
the
superior
court
and
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
was
that
the
california
court
of
appeal
seized
upon
the
concept
of
use
restrictions.
now
the
concept
of
use
restrictions
was
not
even
argued
before
the
california
court
of
appeal
in
any
kind
of
meaningful
sense.
it
wasn’t
raised
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
only
collaterally
touched
upon.
the
decision
came
down,
using
rather
vague
terms,
the
reference
to
the
court
of
appeal
citation
is
found
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
exact
citations
skips
of
my
mind
at
the
moment,
but
if
the
court
is
to
look
at
that
decision,
you
see
that
the
use
restriction
concept
really
did
at
that
point,
give
someone
a
fear
of
the
so
called
immunity
bath.
for
that
reason
both
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
the
counsel
for
the
respondent,
petitioned
the
supreme
court.
there
was
a
dual
reason
behind
the
respondent.
it
was
sought
to
be
urged
a
concept
of
fairness,
but
if
this
was
indeed
a
new
concept
of
--
in
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state
of
california,
namely
the
creation
of
use
restrictions
then
he
should
not
be
criminally
punished
for
having
agreed
with
all
of
the
members
of
the
california
courts
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
applicable.
the
court
granted
the
petition
for
hearing
and
in
fact
it
granted
both
petitions
for
hearing.
there
is
quoted
in
the
reply
brief
what
appears
to
be
a
concession
on
my
part.
i
want
to
place
that
concession
in
proper
context
for
i
do
not
concede
now
that
it
is
a
concession.
if
the
court
compares
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeal
decision
you
will
see
why
i
made
the
statements
in
the
petition
for
a
hearing
before
the
california
supreme
court
as
broadly
as
i
did.
but
the
issue
of
the
use
restrictions
of
course
was
one
of
the
main
issues
before
the
california
supreme
court
and
it
was
fully
argued.
the
california
supreme
court’s
decision
in
the
case
is
substantially
different
than
the
use
restriction
concept
used
by
the
court
of
appeal
below.
at
this
point,
the
california
supreme
court
created
a
limited
concept
of
use
restriction.
the
court
clearly
states
in
that
case
that
it
is
only
the
information
which
is
procured
as
a
result
of
the
compliance
with
the
hit
and
run
statute
which
is
--
which
cannot
be
used.
there
is
no
concept
of
an
immunity
bath
used
by
the
california
supreme
court.
the
language
is
in
three
or
four
different
places
in
the
opinion
clearly
indicating
that
the
only
thing
that
is
within
the
use
restriction
is
this
concept
of
the
information
actually
compelled.
now,
there
are
two
california
court
of
appeal
cases
subsequent
to
byers
which
clearly
shows
that
byers
has
not
produced
that
immunity
bath
in
california
that
the
attorney
general
would
have
you
believe,
simply
is
not
so.
the
first
citation
is
found
in
both,
it
was
first
found
in
my
brief,
the
respondent's
brief
and
later
it
appears
on
the
reply
brief,
it's
bailey
versus
superior
court
of
ventura
and
its
4
cal.
app.
3d
522.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
4
cal.
app.
3d
522,
84
cal.
rptr.
436.
now,
we
were
not
belaboring
that
case.
that
is
a
case
that
came
up
after
the
decision
in
byers.
it
was
a
case
dealing
with
section
2001,
rather
than
2002
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
the
difference
being
2001
is
that
personal
injury
hit
and
run
statute,
2002
is
the
property
damage
hit
and
run
statute.
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
and
the
reason
i
have
pointed
out
that
in
the
brief
was
not
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
reporting
requirement.
for
both
the
statutes
require
you
to
stop
and
to
characterize
yourself,
if
you
will,
as
being
the
driver
of
the
adverse
vehicle
and
in
that
sense
they
are
both
self-incriminating.
for
under
the
facts
of
this
case
for
example,
if
byers
had
indeed
stopped
and
had
characterized
himself
as
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
who
had
sideswiped
the
other
automobile,
he
would
have
been
supplying
the
prosecution
with
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
plainly
and
simply
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
pardon
me?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well
that
isn't
identity.
i
think
that's
the
problem
that
we
have
been
running
through
in
this
case.
this
is
not
an
identity
case.
i
think
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
white
clearly
shows
that
it
is
not,
but
let
me
read
you
from
another
california
case
for
just
a
moment.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
your
honor
and
that's
why
i
want
to
cite
from
this
case
before
you.
a
mere
identity
case
is
a
case
in
which
a
citizen
is
--
for
example,
a
citizen
walking
down
the
street
is
stopped
by
the
authorities
and
asked,
what
is
your
name?
there
are
no
circumstances
requiring
him
to
characterize
himself.
he
doesn't
say
i
am
driver
of
a
vehicle
who
has
just
violated
the
vehicle
code
or
i
am
not
a
burglar
or
a
murderer
or
a
speeder,
nothing
like
that
is
required.
but,
the
vehicle
code
section,
the
herein
question
does
require
you
to
do
that.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
of
course,
that
this
doesn't
reach
that
point.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
think
that
if
you
were
simply
walking
down
the
street
and
there
was
only
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
this
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think,
you
couldn't
require
constitutionally
i
submit,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
a
mere
identity.
under
the
facts
of
this
case
because
it
isn't
the
fellow
walking
down,
he
is
in
suspicious
circumstances.
the
california
supreme
court
specially
found
that.
they
said
there
was
a
substantial
correlation
between
being
a
driver
involved
in
an
accident
and
have
contemporaneously
violated
one
or
more
sections
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
equated
but
nor
has
this
court
ever
required
an
equation.
there
--
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
substantial
correlation
and
the
california
supreme
court
found
that
substantial
correlation
in
almost
words,
i
am
not
purporting
to
quote
but
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
no.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
there
is
complete
correlation
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
agree
with
that
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
--
that
is
argued,
that
position
really
is
argued
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
this
case
even,
even
goes
beyond
that
point.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
the
violation
of
vehicle
code
section
21750
which
was
failure
to
pass
to
the
left
at
a
safe
distance.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
that
isn't.
people
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
your
honor,
may
i
read
for
you
how
the
california
courts
have
construed
that
section.
the
california
courts
getting
back
to
this
case
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
your
honor,
but
i
am
trying
to
dispel
any
idea
that
this
is
just
simply
an
identification
case,
it
is
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
don't
think
you
do.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
you
are
in
the
situation
where
the
statute
requires
you
to
--
if
you
are
the
driver
of
a
vehicle.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
if
you
put
it
that
way,
no.
but,
i
would
again
like
to
refer
to
this
case.
it
says
thus
under
the
facts
peculiar
to
this
case,
we
find
no
error
in
the
court's
instructions
that
to
comply
with
section
2001,
now
this
is
the
personal
injury,
but
the
wording,
the
relevant
wording
is
exactly
the
same.
defendant
was
under
a
duty
not
only
to
identify
himself
as
he
did,
but
also
to
identify
himself
as
the
driver
of
a
vehicle
involved
in
the
accident.
so
that
it
is
not
simply
an
identity
case,
but
it
is
a
case
where
you
require
the
defendant
to
characterize
himself
vis-vis
a
burglar,
vis-a-vis
a
person
who
has
been
the
driver
of
an
offending
vehicle.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
would
venture
a
guess
that
it
is
most
cases.
in
most
cases,
there
is
no
doubt
a
high
correlation
between
being
a
driver
in
the
accident,
being
the
driver
involved
in
an
accident
and
a
violation
of
one
or
more
sections
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
the
california
supreme
court
so
found
and
certainly
it's
in
an
admirable
position
to
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
of
course,
you
really
wouldn't
want
it,
you
don't
need
one,
because
the
operation
of
this
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
there
is
a
certain
genius
about
this
decision
and
the
genius
is
this,
that
it
preserves
exactly
the
states
interest
in
securing
the
information.
if
there
has
not
been
the
contemporaneous
violation
of
another
code
section,
there
is
compliance,
there
is
no
need
to
impose,
use
restrictions,
because
they
are
not
needed.
there
hasn't
been
any
self-incrimination.
but
if
in
fact,
there
has
been
and
the
court
says
there
is
this
high
correlation
reaching
enabling
the
court
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination
involved
regardless
of
the
facts,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
byers
in
fact
did
the
particular
act.
there
is
the
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
so
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
--
and
it
gives
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
is
indeed
a
high
correlation
in
the
state
of
california
between
--
between
being
involved
in
an
accident
which
is
what
they
said.
being
involved
in
an
accident
and
there
being
a
substantial
correlation
between
that
and
having
violated
one
or
more
contemporary
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
it
certainly
would
apply
to
both
drivers.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
no.
all
you
are
telling
me
that
in
a
two-party
case,
one
may
or
may
not.
now,
we
don't
know,
that
--
you
can't
infer
that
there
is
a
50%
probability.
we
all
were
familiar
with
instances
in
which
both
vehicles
indeed
have
been
at
fault,
that's
not
uncommon.
in
fact,
that
maybe
more
common
than
the
situation
in
which
there
is
one
at
fault.
but
i
suspect
that
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
california
supreme
court
is
in
a
much
better
position
to
assess
the
working
of
those
rules
in
california
than
as
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
don't
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
we
call
things
pure
speculation
and
sometimes
when
we
don't
understand
exactly
why
the
court
did
what
it
did.
we
have
things
called
policy
facts.
every
rule
of
law
is
based
upon
a
particular
outlook
on
the
universe
and
when
we
are
litigating
that
particular
fact,
we
have
a
tendency
to
say
well
or
we
do
say
that
the
facts
--
that
the
facts
supporting
that
legal
or
supporting
that
conclusion
have
to
be
in
the
record.
but,
that
isn't
the
kind
of
a
fact
that
is
normally
litigated.
that's
what
we
would
normally
refer
to
as
a
policy
fact,
a
fact
that
the
court
is
in
a
position
to
know
and
i
submit
that,
that's
a
proper
function
of
the
judicial
process.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
he
is
in
--
depending
in
california
on
a
number
of
things,
if
the
accident
cause
damage
more
than
$200.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
he
has
an
obligation
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
but
he
can
claim.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
he
is
going
80
miles
an
hour.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
oh!
oh
no,
i
am
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
fellow
that's
parked
has
an
obligation
to
report.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
it's
technically
i
believe
unless
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
exactly.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
precisely.
now
you
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
is
there
any
review?
well
you
get
it
in
--
you
got
it
in
this
case,
namely
there
is
a
criminal
charge
filed
against
him
and
there
is
a
determination
judicially
as
to
whether
or
not
the
privilege
applied.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
which
evidence?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
the
evidence
from
the
license
plate?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
they
may
use
all
evidence.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
other
than
the
evidence
that
was
compelled
from
him
by
virtue
of
the
hit
and
run
statute.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
the
statute
tells
you
very
clearly
what
is
compelled
and
what
is
not
and
the
court
looks
and
that's
really
the
holding
of
the
bailey
case
and
of
this
other
case
that
i
--
there
are
two
other
cases
or
one
other
case
that
i
think
the
court
really
ought
to
look
at.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
the
touchstone
of
the
fifth
amendment
isn't,
isn't
what
--
isn't,
you
can
only
incriminate
yourself
if
no
one
else
knows.
your
honor
the
touchstone
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
it
can't
come
from
my
mouth.
if
i
were
to
rob
someone
with
a
gun
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
one
could
make
that
claim,
but
as
the
court
will
see
from
these
subsequent
california
cases
the
claim
will
not
be
heeded,
because
they
are
in
a
situation
where
you
can
constitutionally
require
the
fellow
to
stop,
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
the
bailey
case
says,
you
can
compel
him
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident,
you
can
compel
him
to
render
assistance
to
the
injured
party,
but
you
may
not
compel
him
to
speak
his
own
guilt,
which
in
essence
is
what
the
statute
requires.
now
that
they
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
which
the
california
supreme
court
says
is
that
he
of
course,
under
the
facts
of
our
case,
there
was
no
question.
he
knew
that
if
he
characterized
himself
as
the
driver
of
that
vehicle,
he
would
be
admitting
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crimes,
no
question
about
that
under
the
facts
of
our
case.
he
was
prosecuted
for
it.
there
was
no
question
that
he
did
violate
21750,
and
if
he
did
stop
and
did
give
the
information
he
would
be
incriminating
himself.
now
it
is
the
hypothetical
person,
the
person
who
is
just
going
down
the
road,
who
would
also
come
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
i
assume,
under
a
theory
that
there
is
such
a
substantial
correlation
that
the
statute
is
aimed
to
the
select
group
of
people
inherently
suspected
of
crime
because
of
the
substantial
correlation,
but
that's
really
not
our
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
think
we
are
distinctly
in
that
category
of
case.
the
distinction
being
here
that
there
is
--
that
the
court
found
that
there
was
this
substantial
correlation.
finding
the
substantial
correlation,
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
this
case
from
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes
and
leary.
one
could
--
the
attorney
general
argues
that
there
has
been
some
kind
of
a
new
standard
applied.
these
are
magic
words.
we
don't
decide
cases
upon
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
incants
(ph)
the
right
formula
the
purpose
of
that
formula
is
an
order
to
determine
that
there
is
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination
and
that
there
was
in
this
case.
well,
i
have
only
a
short
period
of
time
left
and
i
wanted
to
talk
for
a
moment
about
this
doctrine
of
implied
waiver.
i
don't
think
that
doctrine
of
implied
waiver
raises
a
federal
question
before
this
court.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
this
court,
i
am
assuming
were
recognized
but
the
doctrine
of
implied
waiver
is
a
legal
doctrine,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts,
isn't
a
factual
thing
at
all.
it's
a
legal
fiction
and
the
effect
of
the
legal
fiction
is
to
create
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
when
you
say
someone
is
impliedly
waived
to
something
that
is
really
in
effect
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
the
substantive
rule
and
law
in
california,
is
for
the
california
courts
or
the
california
legislature
to
decide.
it
only
would
become
a
federal
question
if
and
only
if
the
courts
first
decided
that
there
was
in
fact
such
an
implied
waiver,
then
the
constitutional
issue
would
attach,
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
this
was
constitutionally
permissible.
but
under
this
case,
all
of
the
courts,
the
court
of
appeal
expressly
refused
to
find
implied
waiver
here.
there
is
no
basis
for
it
in
either
a
california
statute
or
a
california
case
law.
secondly,
the
california
supreme
court
said
the
same
thing.
they
called
it
“unattainable”
and
again,
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
bailey
case
has
held
the
same
thing.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
idea
of
implied
waiver
presents
this
court
with
any
federal
question
in
this
case.
it's
really
a
red
herring.
again
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
in
a
license
revocation
proceeding?
mr.
john
w.
poulos
that's
a
difficult
question.
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
logically
would
be
yes,
and
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
no.
but
you
know
this
court
has
said
for
example
in
garrity
and
broderick,
and
it's
even
been
applied
in
cases
of
the
private
forfeiture
of
property.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
really
don't
see
that
as
the
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does.
i'm
expressing
doubt
about
that
case.
that
isn't
our
case,
and
i
can
see
competing
interests
where
one
classically
might
say
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
doesn't
apply
in
that
kind
of
situation,
but
the
reasoning
would
be
quite
different.
the
reasoning
would
be
this
that
that
goes
to
the
license
which
permitted
you
to
drive
in
the
first
place
and
it's
quite
different
really
to
say
that
a
state
couldn't
use
it
in
the
license
revocation
proceeding
then
it
is
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
yes,
but
that's
a
little
different.
i
suspect
the
california
court
might,
your
honor
reach
that
result
of
implied
waiver
in
that
kind
of
a
revocation
hearing,
but,
you
know,
that
i
could
see
the
court
legitimately
doing
that.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no.
but,
that
doesn't
meet
marchetti,
grosso,
haynes,
and
leary.
that's
the
basic
philosophy
behind
the
fifth
amendment,
the
powers
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
hoffman
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
the
hoffman
versus
the
united
states
case
followed,
and
malloy
versus
hogan,
there's
an
innumerable
--
well
there's
a
complete
line
of
cases,
using
the
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
test.
yes,
indeed
they
supplied
him,
or
the
sheriff
went
to
the
hypothetical
required
him
to
supply
evidence
which
will
provide
the
prosecution
with
the
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
since
it's
permitted.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
see
none,
and
that's
why
i
think
there's
a
whole
section
in
our
brief
saying,
we
don't
need
the
marchetti,
grosso,
and
haynes
line
of
cases,
but
this
is
a
patent
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
under
prior
case
law.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
about
the
license
tags?
i
think
that
the
state
can
require
a
vehicle
to
have
license
tags.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
that
doesn't,
yeah
on
its
face
the
first
significant
distinction
is
simply
this.
there
is
never
there
a
requirement
of
testimonial
compulsion
which
has
been
this
court's,
one
of
its
touchstones
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
fifth
amendment
does
apply.
this
is
a
case
--
the
case
at
bar
is
one
of
testimonial
compulsion.
the
case
that
you
propose
is
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
because
i
don't
think
that
presents
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
you
have
the
accident.
i
think
is
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
well,
but
maybe
by
the
fact
that
you
give
me
your
address,
you'll
be
a
better
driver.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
because
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
there
is
still
a
crucial
difference.
neither
instances
of
your
hypothetical
require
anyone
to
characterize
himself.
you
aren't
saying
to
the
police
authorities,
i
was
the
driver.
that
is
a
case
of
identity
where
you
are
talking
about
the
license
plate
numbers
and
that's
why
i
thought
it
was
crucial
for
us
to
explore
that
from
the
first.
there
is
that
crucial
distinction
between
an
identification
requirement
and
one
which
requires
you
really
to
characterize
yourself
within
a
criminal
context.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
think
that
presents
the
fifth
amendment
problem.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
if
someone
who
is
--
if
it
required
everyone
who
was
involved
in
the
accident,
the
drivers,
the
riders,
everyone
who
were
involved
in
the
broad
sense
and
whether
it
was
a
driver
or
a
rider
or
a
witness
to
give
his
name
and
address.
i
think
that
is
a
substantially
different
problem
than
we
have
before
us.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
(inaudible)
only
to
automobile
accidents.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
think
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
problem
there.
i
don't
think
it's
of
the
magnitude
that
the
problem
we
have
discussed,
it's
quite
distinguishable.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
he
does
not.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
it
really
is
the
scope
of
the
inquiry.
if
you
can
get
enough
people
in,
so
that
it's
so-called
neutral
on
its
face
which
was
one
of
the
problems
in
the
sullivan
case.
if
it's
--
it
applies
to
so
many
people
outside
of
a
criminal
context,
then
you
see,
you'll
begin
to
run
into
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
real
and
substantial
risk
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
yes,
but
that's
precisely
why
the
state
of
california
in
this
case
used
the
use-restriction
doctrine.
they
said
that
we
recognize
our
interest
in
having
that
information,
but
we
recognize
as
illegitimate.
the
use
of
that
information
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
that
again
is
the
genius
of
the
the
use-restriction
device.
the
court
says,
i
mean
the
california,
all
--
the
california
court
of
appeal
and
california
supreme
court
both
say
that
with
the
use
restriction
device,
we
allow
the
decision
--
we
allow
the
state
to
get
their
legitimate
information.
but
we
do
not
permit
the
state
to
use
that
as
punishment.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
this
--
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case
it
would
litigated
--
it
would
have
to
be
litigated.
i
am
not
sure
at
this
point
that
i
would
say
that
it
was
completely
divested
of
any
fifth
amendment
problem,
but
it
is
a
substantially
different
case.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
nothing.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
nothing
and
the
reason
--
i
think
this
case
--
mr.
john
w.
poulos
--
is
completely
consistent
with
the
sullivan
rule
because
during
the
course
of
the
sullivan
decision,
this
court
said,
in
essence
and
i
am
not
quoting,
but
the
court
said,
you
cannot
refuse
to
file
the
income
tax
return
over
the
blanket
concept
that
to
do
so
will
incriminate
yourself.
but
you
may
make
specific
objection
in
that
return
to
a
specific
question
which
incriminates
you
and
that
is
completely
consistent
with
what
we
are
doing
in
the
byers
case.
it's
a
much
easier
case
than
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes.
in
this
case,
we
come
exactly
within
the
purview
of
what
was
done
in
sullivan.
for
in
this
case,
the
only
that
was
asked
was
self-incriminating.
that
was
not
true
in
sullivan,
although
the
sullivan
court
did
recognize,
speaking
to
mr.
justice
holmes,
did
recognize
that
if
the
specific
question
was
put
to
you
and
indeed
was
self-incriminating,
you
could
claim
it
in
the
return.
i
see
that
this
case
does
nothing
to
sullivan.
in
fact,
i
have
cited
sullivan
in
the
brief
in
support
of
my
contention.
mr.
john
w.
poulos
thank
you.
