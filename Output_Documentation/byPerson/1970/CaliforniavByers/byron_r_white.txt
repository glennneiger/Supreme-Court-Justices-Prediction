justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
there
is
more
--
there
is
more
to
it
than
just
identifying
yourself.
the
fact
is
that
you
have
to
leave
your
name
and
address
at
a
place
where
an
accident
has
happened
which
is
more
than
that.
it
says
my
name
is
so
and
so
and
i
was
here,
i
was
driving
the
car.
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
wouldn't
--
would
you
say
that's
non-testimonial?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
requirement
that
says,
i
so
and
so
have
just
been
involved
in
an
accident?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
here
you
are
saying,
let's
assume
that
a
statute
didn't
require
someone
to
leave
his
name
and
address
when
he
has
had
an
accident,
just
requires
him
to
leave
his
fingerprint
at
the
scene,
as
whose
ever
fingerprint
this
is
was
involved
in
an
accident.
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
the
same
objection
just
because
it
involves
saying,
i
whose
fingerprint
has
left
here,
i
was
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
your
better
argument
than
non-testimonial
nature
of
this,
that
would
really
doesn't
pose
any
substantial
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
in
affect
frustrated
by
the
affect
of
this
decision,
i
would
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
source
of
your
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
compliance.
if
there
had
been
compliance,
it
would
be
frustrated.
justice
byron
r.
white
here
there
was
no
compliance,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
the
license
plates?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
would
be
barred
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
be
forced
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you
may
be
in
an
accident
and
incriminate
yourself
for
identifying
yourself.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
when
you
leave
your
name
on
the
site
of
accident,
you
are
saying
i
was
here
and
i
was
involved
in
the
accident?
justice

white
counsel
you
don't
have
stroke
down
the
statute
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron

white
all
you
have
to
say
there
is
a
complete
correlation
in
this
case?
justice

white
and
what
he
did
(inaudible)
that
he
refused
to
leave
the
statement
behind
and
say
that
he
did
it?
justice
byron

white
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
criminal
act
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
driver
of
the
other
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
driver
--
the
car
driver
(inaudible)
and
just
he
is
getting
out
of
the
car
some
(inaudible)
now
he
is
under
the
obligation
to
report
that
accident
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
it
costs
money
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
do
you
think
that
he
can
claim
the
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
simply
no,
he
would
have
absolutely
no
information
that
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
he
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
privileged
not
to
report
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
because
what?
because
he
has
no
fair
information
that
he
might
be
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
difference
between
your
case
is
the
man
have
reasonable
ground
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
they
appeal
to
court
(inaudible)
forbidding
the
use
of
the
evidence
in
criminal
case.
now,
let's
assume
in
a
judgment
applied
to
the
statute
(inaudible)
will
that
proceeding
revoke
your
license?
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
statement
of

justice
byron

(inaudible).
justice

white
or
that
you
haven't
waived
your
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
leaving
the
name
and
address
not
only
identify
yourself
as
a
driver,
but
as
a
driver
of
the
car
that
has
just
been
in
an
accident?
justice
byron

white
in
a
specific

justice
byron

white
what
about
this
specific
accident?
let's
don't
talk
about
accidents
in

what
about
this
specific
accident
that
the
man
was
just
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it
be
incriminating?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
mr.
justice
black's
question
to
your
colleague,
when
the
police
show
up
at
your
house
and
say
there
was
an
accident
here
last
week,
we
understand
you
were
there,
were
you
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
they
make
it
a
crime
to
refusing
to
answer
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
come
and
ask
you
and
you
say
sorry,
it's
none
of
your
business,
can
you
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it's
an
hour
after
the
accident?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
can
always
ask
you
anything
but
do
you
have
to
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
they
ask
you
that,
were
you
driving
the
car
that
was
in
an
accident
at
6th

new

justice
byron

is
that
incriminating
--
would
it
be
--
would
you
say
that
would
be
incriminating?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
isn't
incriminating,
they
can
make
you
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
police
--
the
state
may
make
him
leave
his
name
and
identify
himself
at
the
scene
of
the
accident,
but
an
half
an

later
he
cannot
me

the
question,
were
you
driving
the
car
in
that
accident?
justice

you
don't

should
be?
