justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
california
had
a
law
that
required
burglars
to
leave
calling
cards
at
the
homes
they
have
burglarized
stating
when
they
were
there,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(voice
overlap)
they
can
tell
they
were
there
use
evidence
against
them
i
was
simply
asking
you
to
point
out
real
difference
of
(inaudible).
i
am
not
saying
which
way
i'm
(inaudible),
you
apply
to
other
crimes,
raise
several
question
in
each
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
just
wanted
to
use
against
him,
by
the
state
in
each
instance.
i
believe
the
same
rule
would
apply,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
inherently
illegal?
i
had
an
idea
that
this
is
illegal
to
go
to
the
law
and
made
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
are
not
strongly
going
with
the
common
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
forced
him
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
enforcement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
could
have
objected,
he
didn’t
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
let's
suppose
that
this
thing
had
occurred,
an
accident
had
occurred
on
the
first
day
of
october,
1969.
a
week
later
police,
chief
of
police
rode
him
and
said
there
was
an
accident
down
at
a
certain
place,
and
a
certain
time,
and
the
man
was
killed.
we
want
you
to
ride
write
us
now,
whether
or
not
you
were
the
man
driving
the
car
that
killed
him.
could
he
be
compelled
after
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
they
didn't
ask
him
to
tell
all
the
details,
but
they
asked
him
to
give
enough,
although,
the
man
was
not
known
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
enough
to
put
them
on
the
trail
and
get
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
making
him
give
an
answer
a
week
later
insofar
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned,
making
him
give
the
time
the
accident
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
familiar
with
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with,
chief
justice
marshall's
statement
in
(inaudible)
that
any
evidence
of
which
a
man
(inaudible),
any
evidence
that
might
tend
to
show
that
you
are
guilty
of
a
crime,
you
can't
refuse
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
been
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
again,
hasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
legislative
by
judicial
proceedings?
i
thought
the
amendment
said,
no
man
shall
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
any
cases
that
we
decided
that
indicates
that
you
got
to
be
asking
a
pending
criminal
case
following
the
line
of
mr.
chief
justice's
argument
that
even
though
there
has
not
been,
it
might
be
used
as
a
link
in
a
chain,
the
victim
of
the
crime,
that
he
can
decline
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
it
be
substantial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
name
and
address
in
connection
with
an
accident
that
has
happened,
somebody
is
hurt
or
somebody
is
killed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
don't
prove
the
guilt
and
innocence.
just
a
question
as
i
understood
it
i
maybe
wrong.
the
link
in
the
chain
it
might
tend
to
incriminate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
sullivan
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
general
rule
and
he
did
not
say
they
had
to
answer
every
question
and
he
said
they
could
be
excused
for
making
the
report
of
the
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
he
should
have
had
quite
an
apprehension
he
was
talking,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
he
tried
for
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
wasn't
a
charge
made
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
an
offense
under
the
laws
of
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
that
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
evidently
could
have
had
a
reason
for
that
apprehension
and
that's
exactly
what
occurred,
the
state
did
charge
him
for
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
found
out,
when
they
found
out,
they
charged
him
with
the
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
was
the
(inaudible),
well
that
was
the
question
i
was
asking
you.
i
was
asking
you,
if
it
wasn't
the
rule
of
law
and
hadn't
been
since
the
marshall
statement
and
if
it's
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence,
it
might
call
the
man
to
be
prosecuted,
not
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
a
link
in
a
chain
of
evidence,
it
might
cause
him
to
be
prosecuted,
he
couldn't
be
compelled
to
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
did.
justice
hugo

he
hasn't
been
convicted

i
