ms.
louise
h.
renne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
and
presents
the
issue
of
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
a
state
hit
and
run
statute.
in
particular,
we
think
the
questions
presented
by
this
case
are
one,
whether
the
requirement
imposed
by
a
state
hit
and
run
statute
that
a
driver
involved
in
an
accident
must
stop
at
the
scene
and
give
his
name
and
address
violates
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
two,
whether
it
is
necessary
to
bar
use
of
that
information
or
fruits
of
that
information
in
any
criminal
proceeding,
in
order
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
did
apply
to
the
requirement
that
a
driver
must
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
identify
himself
and
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
only
be
sustained
if
no
use
of
that
information
or
the
fruits
was
made
in
any
criminal
proceeding.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
a
requirement
that
a
driver
must
stop
and
identify
himself
to
the
owner
of
damaged
property
or
to
a
person
injured
on
the
road
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
bar
identification
evidence
or
the
fruits
to
that
compliance
in
any
kind
of
criminal
proceeding.
the
way
in
which
this
case
arose
procedurally,
was
that
a
two-count
criminal
complaint
was
filed
in
the
mendocino
county
justice
court
for
the
ukiah
judicial
district
in
california,
charging
the
respondent
jonathan
todd
byers
with
two
misdemeanor
violations
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
count
1
of
the
complaint
charged
that
the
respondent
byers
failed
to
pass
to
the
left
safely
as
he
was
overtaking
and
passing
a
vehicle
proceeding
in
the
same
direction.
count
2
of
the
complaint
charged
that
he
violated
the
california
property
damage
hit
and
run
statute.
under
that
statute,
a
driver
is
required
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
when
he
is
involved
in
any
accident
resulting
in
property
damage
and
give
his
name
and
address
to
the
owner
or
of
the
property
damaged
or
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
damaged.
this
requirement
is
similar
to
the
uniform
vehicle
code
requirement
and
in
fact
the
laws
of
all
jurisdictions
in
our
country
impose
similar
requirements
that
driver
must
stop
and
identify
himself.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
against
financial
loss
or
where
similar
requirements
are
imposed
in
personal
injury
hit
and
run
statute
to
ensure
that
people
will
not
be
left
lying
hurt
and
injured
on
the
roads.
there
is
another
section,
part
of
the
statute
2,
section
202
and
that
deals
in
the
case
where
you
have
unattended
property
where
the
driver
or
owner
of
the
damaged
property
cannot
be
immediately
located.
in
that
case,
the
driver
must
leave
a
note
on
the
car
giving
that
same
information
and
statement
of
the
circumstances
and
notify
the
local
police.
the
purpose
of
that
provision
is
to
make
sure
that
when
the
owner
of
the
damaged
property
comes
to
his
property,
he
will
know
who
to
contact
in
the
case
when
he
sees
the
note
or
if
the
note
has
been
lost
or
destroyed,
find
out
who
the
owner
was
from
the
police.
this
particular
part
of
the
statute
has
never
been
raised
and
questioned
in
the
proceedings
below.
instead
from
the
outset
of
the
case
when
the
demurrer
was
first
filed
to
the
complaint,
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
argument
was
that
the
minimal
duty
to
stop
and
give
the
name
and
address
to
the
driver
or
owner
of
the
property
damaged,
violated
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
justice
court
dismissed
the
demurrer.
however,
when
a
writ
of
prohibition
was
then
taken
to
the
superior
court,
the
superior
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
applied
to
this
minimal
duty
and
that
the
respondent
byers
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
failing
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
the
people
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
the
decision
of
the
superior
court.
the
court
of
appeal
held
that
the
--
it
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
did
apply
to
this
identification
requirement.
but
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
be
sustained
if
no
use
were
made
of
the
identification
evidence
or
any
fruits
of
the
compliance
with
the
statute.
both
parties
then
filed
petitions
for
hearing
with
the
state
supreme
court.
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
it
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
that
it
held
that
all
drivers
must
stop
and
comply
with
the
statute.
it
also
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
it
further
held
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
be
sustained
if
no
use
were
made
of
that
information
in
any
kind
of
criminal
proceeding
that
might
arise.
the
court
recognized
that
this
was
a
new
doctrine
of
jurisprudence
because
until
the
decision
below,
this
kind
of
requirement
had
been
uniformly
upheld
in
california
and
other
elsewhere.
so
that
the
court
held
that
fairness
required
that
the
respondent
byer
should
be
excused
for
his
failure
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
because
the
respondent
could
not
have
anticipated
that
the
court
would
impose
this
kind
of
use
restriction.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
and
we
have
three
primary
reasons.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes
your
honor,
this
is
our
understanding
of
the
decision.
now,
we
might
say
that
the
decision
doesn't
really
say
that
we
are
estop
from
the
moment
the
fifth
amendment
applies
from
the
moment
--
from
mere
observation
that
the
man
has
stopped.
what
the
state
supreme
court
held
was
that
the
privilege
applies
at
the
moment,
driver
is
required
to
stop
and
give
his
name
and
address
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
reasonably
believes
that
compliance
will
result
in
self-incrimination.
if
i
might
jump
ahead
of
myself
just
to
give
a
practical
illustration
of
where
i
think
the
court's
decision
leads
us
and
that
case
is
illustrated
by
a
case
now
pending
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
california.
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
are
that
the
petitioner
who
was
in
fact
an
unlicensed
driver
hit
a
parked
car
and
stopped
in
california.
he
stopped
and
apparently
the
owner
of
the
parked
car
was
in
a
restaurant
or
the
nearby
area
and
the
owner
came
out
and
the
petitioner
gave
his
name
and
address
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle.
some
minutes
later
while
the
petitioner
was
standing
there
talking
with
the
owner
of
the
damaged
vehicle,
the
police
arrived
on
the
scene.
it
may
have
been
in
response
to
a
call,
but
for
some
reason
the
police
arrived
on
the
scene.
the
petitioner
immediately
said
to
the
police,
my
car
hit
this
parked
car
and
i
have
been
drinking.
the
police
noticed
that
the
petitioner
did
appear
to
be
a
bit
unsteady
on
his
feet
and
he
did
smell
of
intoxicants
and
advised
the
petitioner
of
the
imply
conscience
statute,
under
which
petitioner
driver
is
deemed
to
have
given
his
consent
to
a
breathalyzer
test.
and
as
a
result
of
that
test
and
the
facts,
a
misdemeanor
drunk
driving
complaint
was
filed
in
the
california
municipal
court.
the
petitioner
argued
one,
that
the
state
could
not
introduce
evidence
of
his
name
and
address
which
he
had
given
to
the
other
driver
because
that
was
barred
by
the
decision
below.
number
two,
but
for
the
statute
he
would
not
have
stopped
and
then
the
police
wouldn't
have
found
out,
wouldn't
have
arrived
on
the
scene
presumably
and
he
wouldn't
have
told
the
police
that
he
was
drinking
and
the
results
of
the
breathalyzer
test
would
not
have
become
known.
the
superior
court,
although
the
municipal
court
refused
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
the
superior
court
held
that
under
the
decision
below
the
information
as
to
the
name
and
address
was
privileged,
the
statements
to
the
police
were
privileged
and
the
results
of
the
breathalyzer
test
were
privileged,
even
though
under
other
cases
of
this
court,
that
information
would
not
be
privileged.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
exactly
our
position
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
this
we
--
that
is
our
position.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
think
how
far
you
can
carry
this,
you
can
just
perhaps
go
on
forever.
it
not
only
applied
--
first
of
all
the
lower
california
courts
have
extended
the
decision
to
the
personal
injury
hit
and
run
statutes.
so
that
now,
any
time
a
driver
is
involved
in
an
accident,
he
was
assured
virtual
immunity
from
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
the
purpose
of
the
hit
and
run
statute
is
not
to
catch
criminals.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
for
very
legitimate
reasons
either
protecting
against
financial
loss
or
to
make
sure
that
people
are
not
left
suffering
on
the
roads.
and
if
in
the
course
complying
with
this
statute,
a
criminal
violation
is
revealed,
we
are
precluded
from
doing
anything
about
it
and
consequently
it's
our
view
that
any
deterrent
effect
of
the
criminal
laws
is
completely
lost,
whereas
as
is
frequently
the
case,
the
right
to
have
a
license
or
predicate
--
or
revocation
of
a
license
is
the
predicated
on
conviction,
we
are
led
into
very
serious
problems
in
making
sure
that
only
careful
and
confident
people
are
driving
on
the
highways.
it's
our
position
that
this
--
the
decision
is
wrong.
it's
wrong
because
the
statute
does
not
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
it's
requirements,
merely
giving
your
name
and
address
is
akin
to
identification
requirements,
it's
akin
to
requirements
that
have
been
imposed
at
any
kind
of
regulatory
field.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
that
is
true
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
we
would
urge
that
it
is
non-testimonial.
first
of
all
we
would
urge
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
although
it
is
verbal
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
it
is
non-testimonial
to
this
extent.
the
respondent
has
conceded
number
one,
that
the
requirement
to
stop
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
and
he
hasn't
taken
issue
with
our
contention
that
a
driver
could
be
required
to
stop
and
leave
his
fingerprint
or
presumably
be
photographed
and
it's
our
contention
that
giving
your
name
and
address
is
akin
to
this
kind
of
identification
in
fact
less
cumbersome.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
the
respondent
has
not
taken
issue
with
our
contention.
of
course,
it
is
our
position
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
never
been
carried
this
far.
even
if
it
would
be
considered
testimonial,
certainly
the
requirement
to
stop
and
give
your
name
and
address,
identify
yourself
doesn't
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
it
is
not
a
crime
number
one,
to
drive
and
two
be
in
an
accident
--
excuse
me--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
certainly
a
very
clear
argument
in
our
mind,
your
honor,
that
this
does
not
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
we
stand
very
firmly
on
that
and
that
the
requirement
--
well,
i
may
back
track
just
to
make
clear
of
course
of
being
in
an
accident
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
committed
a
crime.
it
can
happen
to
anybody.
it's
a
very
chance
event
and
since
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
for
other
reasons
and
the
information
required
is
neutral
that
this
does
not
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
that
is
our
position
your
honor
that
even
if
there
should
be
any
overtones
of
self-incrimination
that
the
requirement
to
stop
and
give
your
name
and
address
and
to
be
--
the
state
to
be
able
to
use
that
information
later
is
a
valid
condition
that
the
state
may
impose
upon
drivers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
that
this
case
can
meet
the
constitutional
test
of
an
implied
waiver
that
when
a
person
puts
a
very
dangerous
instrumentality
under
their
control,
an
instrumentality
which
the
statistics
show
us
results
in
death
and
destruction
comparable
to
war
and
when
it's
also
considered
that
this
kind
of
duty
has
been
imposed
upon
driver
since
automobiles
were
first
invented.
it
has
been
assumed
that
when
you
are
in
an
accident
you
should
stop
that
there
could
even
be
an
implied
waiver
and
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
hold
as
they
have
held
that
we
cannot
enforce
the
criminal
laws
or
make
sure
there
are
only
careful
and
confident
drivers
are
on
the
highway
seems
to
us
is
an
unwarranted
extension
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
it's
unresponsively
need,
the
recognition
of
the
need
despite
any
assertion
of
the
privilege.
we
think
that
the
reading
of
the
state
supreme
court
opinion
makes
clear
that
the
court
reached
the
decision
that
it
did
based
on
this
court's
opinions
in
the
albertson,
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
cases
and
the
leary
cases
in
which
the
court
held
unconstitutional
registration
requirements
in
the
areas
of
communist
registration,
gambling,
firearm
and
marijuana
transfer
statutes.
but
in
those
cases
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
they
but
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
we
think
that
the
very
fact
that
it
didn't
go
quite
that
far
your
honor
indicates
that
the
state
supreme
court
recognized
that
these
statutes
must
be
upheld
insofar
as
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
and
it's
our
position
your
honor
that
in
coming
to
conclusion
that
this
balance
could
be
reached
that
the
state
was
quite
unrealistic
in
coming
to
that
conclusion.
we
think
that
it
reached
that
conclusion
because
it
thought
it
was
compelled
to
hold
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
applicable
to
this
requirement
because
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
albertson,
marchetti
and
grosso,
haynes
cases.
if
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
requirement
fell
within
the
fifth
amendment,
it
then
wouldn't
have
gone
on
to
come
to
or
attempt
to
resolve
the
problem
by
imposing
use
restrictions.
and
in
relying
we
think
in
anyway
upon
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
for
the
conclusion
it
reached
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
court
was
mistaken
because
we
think
that
this
court
did
make
it
quite
clear
that
those
cases
were
dealing
with
very
narrow
areas,
gamblers,
people
who
had
the
registered
firearms
and
the
very
fact
of
registering
the
firearms
would
incriminate
them.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
case
at
all
in
the
driver
accident
case.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
excuse
me
your
honor.
first
of
all,
whether
or
not
the
state
may
will
get
the
name
and
address
may
depend
on
the
circumstances.
now
in
the
case
where
you
have
attended
property,
i
mean
if
the
driver
is
right
there
under
the
hit
and
run
statute,
you
only
need
to
give
your
name
and
address
to
the
driver
and
then
leave.
and
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
owner
of
damage
property
notify
the
police
of
the
accident.
so
--
and
the
court
opinion
below
doesn't
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
state
interest
in
having
a
private
exchange
of
information
is
to
protect
against
financial
loss.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
that's
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
other
purpose
that
the
state
would
have
--
first
of
all
the
state
has
an
interest
in
any
case
in
knowing
who
caused
accidents
or
why
accidents
were
caused.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
but
the
other
interest
is
in
enforcing
its
criminal
laws,
that
interest
is
not
satisfied.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
that
i
don't
know
what
the
state
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
there
is
a
quite
a
lot
of
difference
your
honor
going
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
the
difference
is
that
if
the
statute
read
that
only
people
driving
80
miles
per
hour
need
to
stop
and
give
their
name
and
address,
then
an
80
miles
an
hour
were
per
se
crime
that
perhaps
it
could
be
said
in
that
case
that
the
only
state
interest
was
to
catch
criminals
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
but
here
the
purpose
of
the
statute
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
magic
of
the
having
the
accident
is
that
that
triggers
the
hit
and
run
statute
and
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
we
know
we
don't
know,
whether
or
not
and
you
never
know
why
an
accident
was
caused.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
state
has
a
number
of
interests.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
your
honor
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
having
a
name
and
address
--
now
that
i
just
make
perfectly
clear
that
in
this
case
you
are
only
required
to
give
to
a
third
party,
but
of
course
there
are
other
reporting
statutes,
that
are
not
involved
in
that
case
but
this
interest
--
state
has
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
knowing
number
one,
who
is
involved
in
accidents,
are
they
careful
and
competent
drivers.
we
may
--
as
a
person
is
involved
in
numbers
of
accidents,
he
may
not
be
a
careful
and
competent
driver.
so
it
maybe
necessary
to
revoke
his
license,
which
is
an
interest
totally
unrelated
to
prosecutorial
interest.
we
may
want
to
know
why
your
accident
is
caused,
by
the
accidents
--
if
it's
reported
us
to
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
you
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
if
in
any
regulatory
area,
there
are
going
to
be
criminal
statutes.
it's
presumably
the
legislature's
view
or
congress'
view,
if
it's
a
federal
regulatory
area,
the
criminal
statutes
have
some
deterrent
value
on
the
behavior
of
the
regulated
person.
now,
if
the
state
or
the
congress,
for
example
can't
enforce
income
tax
laws,
if
the
criminal
statutes
cannot
be
enforced
as
a
criminal
matter
or
as
a
practical
matter
then
there
is
no
deterrent
effect.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it's
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
the
statute.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct
your
honor
the
state
may
not.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
but
the
problem
is
that
the
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no
not
--
yes
when
it's
just
given
to
the
one
driver
then
we
may
not
find
out
about
it,
of
course
that
also
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
no
the
real
problem
your
honor
is
that,
if
we
find
out
about
it,
if
the
police
is
happened
by,
which
is
what
happened
in
the
case
in
stockton,
then
--
and
they
discover
either
the
man
was
drunk
or
he
was
an
unlicensed
driver,
then
because
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
privilege
applies
at
the
very
moment,
a
person
is
required
to
stop
and
identify
himself.
if
the
privilege
applies
at
that
very
moment,
then
if
we
happened
to
find
out
a
criminal
violation
is
revealed
at
that
moment,
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
but
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
reason
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
reason
the
driver
stopped
your
honor
was,
because
he
hit
a
car.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
he
alleged
that
he
stopped
because
of
the
statute.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
it's
not
this
case
your
honor.
but
because
this
man
never
stopped
of
course,
but
in
any
case
if
the
privilege
applies
at
the
very
point
a
man
is
required
to
stop,
then
the
state
can
really
cannot
do
anything
about
it
if
a
criminal
prosecution
should
be
revealed.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
said
you
can't
use
that
information
or
the
fruits
of
the
compliance.
now
the
compliance
means
from
the
minute
you
stop
to,
so
that
we
can't
use
the
driver's
name
and
address.
well,
we
submit
a
name
and
address
just
are
not
incriminating,
there
is
nothing
incriminating
about
driving.
there
is
nothing
about
being
--
incriminating
about
being
a
driver.
if
a
criminal
prosecution
is
warranted,
it's
up
to
the
state
to
show
that
an
accident
was
caused
any
--
by
criminal
conduct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
--
i
would
have
to
qualify
my
opinion
on
this
your
honor,
there
certainly
is,
there
is
not
any
kind
of
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
agreement
that
he
would
stop.
no,
there
is
not
an
express
waiver
of
any
kind,
but
it
would
be
our
position
that
this
kind
of
duty
has
been
upheld.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
i
am
sorry
as
an
implicit
wavier,
yes.
i
think
it
should
be
perfectly
clear
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
hess
v.
pawloski
has
a
very
great
deal
of
relevance
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
other
decisions
of
this
court
as
our
recalling
illinois
versus
allen
last
year,
the
court
held
that
a
defendant
by
his
conduct
can
waive
his
right
to
be
present
at
a
jury
--
before
the
jury
or
court
hearing.
i
think
the
driving
is
like
any
other
area
of
regulation.
there
are
certain
minimal
requirements
that
must
be
met,
certain
information
that
must
either
be
given
to
a
private
individual
because
of
a
regulatory
interest
or
to
the
government.
and
where
the
information
is
neutral,
and
it
has
legitimate
regulatory
purposes,
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
excuse
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
as
a
practical
matter
the
case
was
never
prosecuted,
your
honor,
because
we
have
always
been
on
appeal
and
so
meanwhile
the
prosecution
on
count
one
has
been
held
on
abeyance
so
there
has
been
nothing
that's
happened.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
would
certainly
think
so
your
honor,
we
are
in
very
difficult
position.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
of
course
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
particular
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
we
believe
it
would
frustrated
in
the
decision
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct,
there
are
--
there
may
well
be
areas
where
a
theory
of
use
restrictions
have
very
valid
purpose
and
can
accommodate
a
government's
need
for
information,
and
the
privilege,
but
the
problem
in
this
case
is
where
accident
occurs,
it's
a
chance
of
thing
it
occurs,
on
this
--
the
duty
must
be
performed
on
the
spot
and
if
the
privilege
applies,
the
minute
there
is
an
accident,
the
minute
there
is
a
duty
to
stop
and
give
your
name
and
address,
we
think
we
are
placed
in
a
virtual
impossible
situations
as
far
as
undertaking
any
kind
of
criminal
law
enforcement.
excuse
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
holding
of
one
court
particular,
bailey
versus
superior
court
which
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
maybe
the
answer
to
your
question
at
least
one
distinction
the
california
courts
have
tried
to
draw.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
any
kind
of
distinction.
certainly
you
cannot
draw
a
distinction
insofar
as
giving
your
name
and
address
is
concerned.
you
cannot
draw
a
distinction
between
the
personal
injury
or
the
property
damage
hit
and
run
statute
and
the
california
courts
have
so
held.
now
in
the
bailey
case
that
court
attempted
to
draw
a
distinction
when
it
said
that
the
duty
to
stop
and
render
aid
and
assistance
was
non-testimonial
and
that
you
could
draw
a
distinction
along
those
lines
whether
or
not
that
distinction
would
hold
water,
should
that
case
or
a
similar
case
come
before
the
state
supreme
court
is
open
to
question.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
kind
of
distinction
to
pursue.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
if
i
might
add
your
honor
that
every
time
from
the
years
ago
when
hit
and
run
statutes
were
attacked
under
this
grounds,
they
have
been
uniformly
upheld.
only
one
reported
case
ever
held
a
hit
and
run
statute
unconstitutional,
and
it
did
so
on
that
ground,
on
the
ground
that
the
driver
was
required
to
stop
and
give
a
full
report
of
the
accident.
that
was
rambrandt
(ph)
versus
city
of
cleveland.
but
in
that
case
the
court
was
very
careful
to
draw
a
distinction
that
anything
less
than
that
was
not
violative
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
recently
the
state
court
of
--
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
their
statute
constitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
also.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
only
burglars
to
stop.
i
mean
if
the
purpose
is
to
have
only
burglars
stop.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
and
in
a
home
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
statute
probably
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
the
only
purpose
of
that
statute
would
be
to
catch
burglars,
burglary
is
per
se
a
crime.
it
occurs
in
a
home.
these
are
all
very
distinguishing
features
from
the
case
we
have
presented
here.
driving
is
not
a
crime.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
it
might
raise
questions.
you
would
have
to,
depending
on
ask
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
why
do
you
want
it?
of
course
drive,
i
think,
the
simple
answer
is
that
driving
just
is
not
a
crime.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
only
purpose
was
to
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
last
question
answered,
we
think
that
the
decision
below
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
u.s.
v.
sullivan
for
the
reason
that
u.s.
v.
sullivan
held
that
taxpayers
must
still
file
a
return
even
though
the
source
of
their
income
was
illegal.
so
that
a
taxpayer
had
to
identify
himself
as
a
taxpayer.
similarly
here,
a
diver
need
to
only
identify
himself
as
a
driver.
it's
identification
is
part
of
a
regulatory
group,
so
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
does
identify,
yes
it
does
identify
yourself
as
a
driver
of
a
car
that
has
been
involved
in
an
accident.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
a
specific
accident,
that's
correct
your
honor.
but,
the
fact
that
you
have
been
in
an
accident
certainly
does
not
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
would
not
be
incriminating
and
in
this
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
fact
that
you
give
the
name
and
address
or
you
have
given
a
name
and
address
as
being
the
driver
in
this
specific
accident
has
nothing
to
do
with
incrimination
in
my
understanding
of
your
question
your
honor.
if
i
might
add
--
if
i
understand
your
question
i
think
that
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
respondent
has
now
conceded
that
it
was
criminal
conduct
that
caused
the
accident.
but,
if
a
trial
had
been
held,
this
is
what
the
trial
would
have
been
all
about
and
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
until
the
concession,
nobody
could
say
that
it
was
caused
by
criminal
conduct,
that
was
the
charge.
but,
the
state
would
have
to
prove
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
a
criminal
trial
could
be
that
there
might
be
a
defense
that
the
respondent
byers
could
show
that
as
he
attempted
to
pass
the
car,
the
driver
of
the
other
car
speeded
up.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
that
the
police
could
ask
that
question.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
it
will
have
to
depend
upon
why
they
were
asking
the
question?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
week's
lag
maybe
sufficient
and
particularly
at
what
the
police
were
trying
to
show
is
that
you
were
hit
and
run
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
that
the
police
could
ask
that
question.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
you
would
certainly
if
i
am
answering
the
question,
this
way
you
would
certainly
have
to
answer
if
you
were
there
right
on
the
spot
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
you
would
have
to
answer
that.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
maybe
a
different
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
--
could
the
state
make
that
a
crime?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
they
could.
i
think
that
a
lot
would
have
to
depend
upon
that
what
were
the
circumstances.
then
i
think
you
get
into
other
kinds
of
cases.
when
you
have
the
accident
scene,
i
mean
you
have
an
immediate
event
that
requires
a
person
to
answer,
i
mean,
you
have
on
this
probable
cause
at
that
point
where
you
have
a
person
in
their
home
you
might
have
--
i
think
your
problems
may
be
different,
but
i
don't
think
we
--
in
order
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
on
and
consider
that
other
case.
i
think
it's
enough
that
if
there
--
you
are
on
the
scene
of
the
accident,
the
police
can
require
you
to
show
your
license,
they
can
require
you
to
answer.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
the
problems
maybe
entirely
different.
i
think
it
raises
entirely
different
kinds
of
issues,
entirely
different
kinds
of
considerations
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
under
california
law,
under
various
statutes,
he
could
be
required
to
answer.
it
would
under
--
he
could
be
required
to
answer,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
if
the
reports
are
available
to
persons
involved
in
accidents.
they
are
kept
confidential
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
have
some
interest
in
seeing
the
report.
if
i
might
also
add
your
honor
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
oh,
certainly
and
i
think
that
when
you
pose
the
question,
isn't
this
the
exact
same
case
as
when
you
are
filling
out
a
license
or
a
vehicle
registration
application.
i
think
the
answer
is,
yes
this
is
the
same
case.
identification
is
involved.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
yes,
but
if
your
license
is
seen,
then
it
is
just
--
you
just
found
out
who
filed
out
the
application.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
except
under
the
theory
the
state
supreme
court
i
mean
it
could
be
the
case
that
if
you
are
wanted
for
another
crime,
you
are
not
required
to
show
your
license
because
that
might
incriminate
you
for
reasons
unrelated
to
the
accident
at
all.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
your
honor,
are
you
referring
to
the
link
in
a
chain
kind
of
analysis?
that
line,
yes.
we
are
familiar
with
that
line
of
cases
and
it
was
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
--
the
use
of
that
certainly
has
been
considered.
but
usually
when
it
has
been
considered,
it
has
been
considered
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
proceeding
or
legislative
committee
proceeding
where
the
very
fact
that
a
witness
is
called
before
the
court
or
the
legislature
may
--
there
is
official
attention
has
been
focused.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
in
any
criminal
case.
if
i
might
add
in
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
line
of
cases
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
there
are
two
cases
that
come
--
are
two
lines
of
cases
that
immediately
come
to
mind
in
answering
your
question.
the
first
is
the
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
line
of
cases
in
talking
about
the
link
of
the
chain
says
that
the
information
required
must
constitute
a
substantial
link
in
the
chain.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
name
and
address,
no
your
honor.
it's
not
a
crime
to
be
in
an
accident.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
could
be
caused
by
any
number
of
reasons.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
if
we
are
going
to
extend
the
link
and
the
chain
analysis
endlessly,
then
it
would
mean
that
u.s.
in
u.s.
v.
sullivan
that
decision
should
have
gone
the
other
way
because
the
fact
that
a
taxpayer
files
is
required
to
file
a
tax
return
in
which
by
the
fact
that
he
states
the
source
of
his
income
or
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
state
the
source
of
his
income.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
sullivan
case
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
and
we
think
that
we
have
the
exact
same
situation
in
this
case
your
honor.
we
are
not
asking
the
driver
to
state
how
many
drinks
did
you
have
or
had
your
been
drinking
prior
to
the
accident.
the
driver
is
only
required
to
say
that
he
was
a
driver
and
it's
a
same
thing
--
same
case
also
as
shapiro
versus
united
states
which
we
referred
to
in
our
briefs
embodying
the
required
records
doctrine
where
you
have
a
regulatory
program.
the
information
required
is
essential
for
the
regulatory
program
and
in
this
case,
it's
even
more
neutral
kind
than
that
required
in
shapiro
versus
united
states,
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
pardon
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
respondent
in
this
case?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
this
case
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
there
was
a
charge
made
against
him.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
charge
was
failure
to
pass
to
the
left
safely.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
is
an
offense
under
the
laws
of
california.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
mwell,
nothing
has
happened
yet
except
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
man
--
it
would
be
unfair
to
try
the
respondent
byers.
now,
our
position
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
state
did
charge
him,
but
the
record
doesn't
show
how
the
state
found
out,
it
was
this
man.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
they
did
because
at
the
trial,
the
facts
of
what
actually
occurred
would
have
come
out.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
the
state
did
not
find
out.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
he
might
be
turned
loose.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct,
that
has
been
a
statement
law.
the
problem
is
how
do
you
apply
link
in
the
chain.
i
am
reminded
of
the
one
of
the
nail,
the
shoe
was
lost,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
every
piece
of
information
that
a
person
can
be
required
give,
a
manufacturer
has
to
label
his
goods,
the
physician
has
to
report
nature
and
causes
of
accident,
every
piece
of
information,
a
person
could
be
required
to
give,
could
lead
to
some
conceivable
criminal
charge.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
did
in
this
case.
well,
in
this
case
he
didn't
stop,
so
it
didn't.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
at
the
trial,
we
would
have
found
out
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty
.he
now
says
he
was,
but
we
didn't
know
it
for
sure
earlier.
i
just
would
finally
like
to
add
in
conclusion
that
insofar
as
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
there
is
a
substantial
shadow
of
suspicion
cast
upon
people
in
accident,
that
that
determination
is
unsubstantiated
by
the
record.
there
is
no
evidence.
this
case
arose
on
the
pleadings
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
the
state
supreme
court
in
our
view,
did
not
rest
on
any
particular
provisions
of
california
law.
it
seemed
to
believe
it
was
compelled
to
do
so
in
cases
of
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes.
we
think
those
cases
are
distinguishable
because
of
the
very
facts
involved
in
those
cases
and
not
here.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
and
presents
the
issue
of
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
a
state
hit
and
run
statute.
in
particular,
we
think
the
questions
presented
by
this
case
are
one,
whether
the
requirement
imposed
by
a
state
hit
and
run
statute
that
a
driver
involved
in
an
accident
must
stop
at
the
scene
and
give
his
name
and
address
violates
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
two,
whether
it
is
necessary
to
bar
use
of
that
information
or
fruits
of
that
information
in
any
criminal
proceeding,
in
order
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
did
apply
to
the
requirement
that
a
driver
must
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
identify
himself
and
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
only
be
sustained
if
no
use
of
that
information
or
the
fruits
was
made
in
any
criminal
proceeding.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
a
requirement
that
a
driver
must
stop
and
identify
himself
to
the
owner
of
damaged
property
or
to
a
person
injured
on
the
road
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
bar
identification
evidence
or
the
fruits
to
that
compliance
in
any
kind
of
criminal
proceeding.
the
way
in
which
this
case
arose
procedurally,
was
that
a
two-count
criminal
complaint
was
filed
in
the
mendocino
county
justice
court
for
the
ukiah
judicial
district
in
california,
charging
the
respondent
jonathan
todd
byers
with
two
misdemeanor
violations
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
count
1
of
the
complaint
charged
that
the
respondent
byers
failed
to
pass
to
the
left
safely
as
he
was
overtaking
and
passing
a
vehicle
proceeding
in
the
same
direction.
count
2
of
the
complaint
charged
that
he
violated
the
california
property
damage
hit
and
run
statute.
under
that
statute,
a
driver
is
required
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
when
he
is
involved
in
any
accident
resulting
in
property
damage
and
give
his
name
and
address
to
the
owner
or
of
the
property
damaged
or
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
damaged.
this
requirement
is
similar
to
the
uniform
vehicle
code
requirement
and
in
fact
the
laws
of
all
jurisdictions
in
our
country
impose
similar
requirements
that
driver
must
stop
and
identify
himself.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
against
financial
loss
or
where
similar
requirements
are
imposed
in
personal
injury
hit
and
run
statute
to
ensure
that
people
will
not
be
left
lying
hurt
and
injured
on
the
roads.
there
is
another
section,
part
of
the
statute
2,
section
202
and
that
deals
in
the
case
where
you
have
unattended
property
where
the
driver
or
owner
of
the
damaged
property
cannot
be
immediately
located.
in
that
case,
the
driver
must
leave
a
note
on
the
car
giving
that
same
information
and
statement
of
the
circumstances
and
notify
the
local
police.
the
purpose
of
that
provision
is
to
make
sure
that
when
the
owner
of
the
damaged
property
comes
to
his
property,
he
will
know
who
to
contact
in
the
case
when
he
sees
the
note
or
if
the
note
has
been
lost
or
destroyed,
find
out
who
the
owner
was
from
the
police.
this
particular
part
of
the
statute
has
never
been
raised
and
questioned
in
the
proceedings
below.
instead
from
the
outset
of
the
case
when
the
demurrer
was
first
filed
to
the
complaint,
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
argument
was
that
the
minimal
duty
to
stop
and
give
the
name
and
address
to
the
driver
or
owner
of
the
property
damaged,
violated
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
justice
court
dismissed
the
demurrer.
however,
when
a
writ
of
prohibition
was
then
taken
to
the
superior
court,
the
superior
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
applied
to
this
minimal
duty
and
that
the
respondent
byers
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
failing
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
the
people
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
the
decision
of
the
superior
court.
the
court
of
appeal
held
that
the
--
it
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
did
apply
to
this
identification
requirement.
but
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
be
sustained
if
no
use
were
made
of
the
identification
evidence
or
any
fruits
of
the
compliance
with
the
statute.
both
parties
then
filed
petitions
for
hearing
with
the
state
supreme
court.
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
it
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
that
it
held
that
all
drivers
must
stop
and
comply
with
the
statute.
it
also
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
it
further
held
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
could
be
sustained
if
no
use
were
made
of
that
information
in
any
kind
of
criminal
proceeding
that
might
arise.
the
court
recognized
that
this
was
a
new
doctrine
of
jurisprudence
because
until
the
decision
below,
this
kind
of
requirement
had
been
uniformly
upheld
in
california
and
other
elsewhere.
so
that
the
court
held
that
fairness
required
that
the
respondent
byer
should
be
excused
for
his
failure
to
stop
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
because
the
respondent
could
not
have
anticipated
that
the
court
would
impose
this
kind
of
use
restriction.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
and
we
have
three
primary
reasons.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes
your
honor,
this
is
our
understanding
of
the
decision.
now,
we
might
say
that
the
decision
doesn't
really
say
that
we
are
estop
from
the
moment
the
fifth
amendment
applies
from
the
moment
--
from
mere
observation
that
the
man
has
stopped.
what
the
state
supreme
court
held
was
that
the
privilege
applies
at
the
moment,
driver
is
required
to
stop
and
give
his
name
and
address
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
reasonably
believes
that
compliance
will
result
in
self-incrimination.
if
i
might
jump
ahead
of
myself
just
to
give
a
practical
illustration
of
where
i
think
the
court's
decision
leads
us
and
that
case
is
illustrated
by
a
case
now
pending
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
california.
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
are
that
the
petitioner
who
was
in
fact
an
unlicensed
driver
hit
a
parked
car
and
stopped
in
california.
he
stopped
and
apparently
the
owner
of
the
parked
car
was
in
a
restaurant
or
the
nearby
area
and
the
owner
came
out
and
the
petitioner
gave
his
name
and
address
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle.
some
minutes
later
while
the
petitioner
was
standing
there
talking
with
the
owner
of
the
damaged
vehicle,
the
police
arrived
on
the
scene.
it
may
have
been
in
response
to
a
call,
but
for
some
reason
the
police
arrived
on
the
scene.
the
petitioner
immediately
said
to
the
police,
my
car
hit
this
parked
car
and
i
have
been
drinking.
the
police
noticed
that
the
petitioner
did
appear
to
be
a
bit
unsteady
on
his
feet
and
he
did
smell
of
intoxicants
and
advised
the
petitioner
of
the
imply
conscience
statute,
under
which
petitioner
driver
is
deemed
to
have
given
his
consent
to
a
breathalyzer
test.
and
as
a
result
of
that
test
and
the
facts,
a
misdemeanor
drunk
driving
complaint
was
filed
in
the
california
municipal
court.
the
petitioner
argued
one,
that
the
state
could
not
introduce
evidence
of
his
name
and
address
which
he
had
given
to
the
other
driver
because
that
was
barred
by
the
decision
below.
number
two,
but
for
the
statute
he
would
not
have
stopped
and
then
the
police
wouldn't
have
found
out,
wouldn't
have
arrived
on
the
scene
presumably
and
he
wouldn't
have
told
the
police
that
he
was
drinking
and
the
results
of
the
breathalyzer
test
would
not
have
become
known.
the
superior
court,
although
the
municipal
court
refused
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
the
superior
court
held
that
under
the
decision
below
the
information
as
to
the
name
and
address
was
privileged,
the
statements
to
the
police
were
privileged
and
the
results
of
the
breathalyzer
test
were
privileged,
even
though
under
other
cases
of
this
court,
that
information
would
not
be
privileged.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
exactly
our
position
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
this
we
--
that
is
our
position.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
think
how
far
you
can
carry
this,
you
can
just
perhaps
go
on
forever.
it
not
only
applied
--
first
of
all
the
lower
california
courts
have
extended
the
decision
to
the
personal
injury
hit
and
run
statutes.
so
that
now,
any
time
a
driver
is
involved
in
an
accident,
he
was
assured
virtual
immunity
from
criminal
prosecution.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
the
purpose
of
the
hit
and
run
statute
is
not
to
catch
criminals.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
for
very
legitimate
reasons
either
protecting
against
financial
loss
or
to
make
sure
that
people
are
not
left
suffering
on
the
roads.
and
if
in
the
course
complying
with
this
statute,
a
criminal
violation
is
revealed,
we
are
precluded
from
doing
anything
about
it
and
consequently
it's
our
view
that
any
deterrent
effect
of
the
criminal
laws
is
completely
lost,
whereas
as
is
frequently
the
case,
the
right
to
have
a
license
or
predicate
--
or
revocation
of
a
license
is
the
predicated
on
conviction,
we
are
led
into
very
serious
problems
in
making
sure
that
only
careful
and
confident
people
are
driving
on
the
highways.
it's
our
position
that
this
--
the
decision
is
wrong.
it's
wrong
because
the
statute
does
not
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
it's
requirements,
merely
giving
your
name
and
address
is
akin
to
identification
requirements,
it's
akin
to
requirements
that
have
been
imposed
at
any
kind
of
regulatory
field.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
that
is
true
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
we
would
urge
that
it
is
non-testimonial.
first
of
all
we
would
urge
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
although
it
is
verbal
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
it
is
non-testimonial
to
this
extent.
the
respondent
has
conceded
number
one,
that
the
requirement
to
stop
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
and
he
hasn't
taken
issue
with
our
contention
that
a
driver
could
be
required
to
stop
and
leave
his
fingerprint
or
presumably
be
photographed
and
it's
our
contention
that
giving
your
name
and
address
is
akin
to
this
kind
of
identification
in
fact
less
cumbersome.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
the
respondent
has
not
taken
issue
with
our
contention.
of
course,
it
is
our
position
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
never
been
carried
this
far.
even
if
it
would
be
considered
testimonial,
certainly
the
requirement
to
stop
and
give
your
name
and
address,
identify
yourself
doesn't
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
it
is
not
a
crime
number
one,
to
drive
and
two
be
in
an
accident
--
excuse
me--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
certainly
a
very
clear
argument
in
our
mind,
your
honor,
that
this
does
not
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
we
stand
very
firmly
on
that
and
that
the
requirement
--
well,
i
may
back
track
just
to
make
clear
of
course
of
being
in
an
accident
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
committed
a
crime.
it
can
happen
to
anybody.
it's
a
very
chance
event
and
since
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
for
other
reasons
and
the
information
required
is
neutral
that
this
does
not
create
a
substantial
hazard
of
self-incrimination.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
that
is
our
position
your
honor
that
even
if
there
should
be
any
overtones
of
self-incrimination
that
the
requirement
to
stop
and
give
your
name
and
address
and
to
be
--
the
state
to
be
able
to
use
that
information
later
is
a
valid
condition
that
the
state
may
impose
upon
drivers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
that
this
case
can
meet
the
constitutional
test
of
an
implied
waiver
that
when
a
person
puts
a
very
dangerous
instrumentality
under
their
control,
an
instrumentality
which
the
statistics
show
us
results
in
death
and
destruction
comparable
to
war
and
when
it's
also
considered
that
this
kind
of
duty
has
been
imposed
upon
driver
since
automobiles
were
first
invented.
it
has
been
assumed
that
when
you
are
in
an
accident
you
should
stop
that
there
could
even
be
an
implied
waiver
and
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
hold
as
they
have
held
that
we
cannot
enforce
the
criminal
laws
or
make
sure
there
are
only
careful
and
confident
drivers
are
on
the
highway
seems
to
us
is
an
unwarranted
extension
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
it's
unresponsively
need,
the
recognition
of
the
need
despite
any
assertion
of
the
privilege.
we
think
that
the
reading
of
the
state
supreme
court
opinion
makes
clear
that
the
court
reached
the
decision
that
it
did
based
on
this
court's
opinions
in
the
albertson,
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
cases
and
the
leary
cases
in
which
the
court
held
unconstitutional
registration
requirements
in
the
areas
of
communist
registration,
gambling,
firearm
and
marijuana
transfer
statutes.
but
in
those
cases
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
they
but
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
we
think
that
the
very
fact
that
it
didn't
go
quite
that
far
your
honor
indicates
that
the
state
supreme
court
recognized
that
these
statutes
must
be
upheld
insofar
as
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
and
it's
our
position
your
honor
that
in
coming
to
conclusion
that
this
balance
could
be
reached
that
the
state
was
quite
unrealistic
in
coming
to
that
conclusion.
we
think
that
it
reached
that
conclusion
because
it
thought
it
was
compelled
to
hold
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
applicable
to
this
requirement
because
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
albertson,
marchetti
and
grosso,
haynes
cases.
if
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
requirement
fell
within
the
fifth
amendment,
it
then
wouldn't
have
gone
on
to
come
to
or
attempt
to
resolve
the
problem
by
imposing
use
restrictions.
and
in
relying
we
think
in
anyway
upon
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
for
the
conclusion
it
reached
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
court
was
mistaken
because
we
think
that
this
court
did
make
it
quite
clear
that
those
cases
were
dealing
with
very
narrow
areas,
gamblers,
people
who
had
the
registered
firearms
and
the
very
fact
of
registering
the
firearms
would
incriminate
them.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
case
at
all
in
the
driver
accident
case.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
excuse
me
your
honor.
first
of
all,
whether
or
not
the
state
may
will
get
the
name
and
address
may
depend
on
the
circumstances.
now
in
the
case
where
you
have
attended
property,
i
mean
if
the
driver
is
right
there
under
the
hit
and
run
statute,
you
only
need
to
give
your
name
and
address
to
the
driver
and
then
leave.
and
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
owner
of
damage
property
notify
the
police
of
the
accident.
so
--
and
the
court
opinion
below
doesn't
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
state
interest
in
having
a
private
exchange
of
information
is
to
protect
against
financial
loss.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
that's
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
other
purpose
that
the
state
would
have
--
first
of
all
the
state
has
an
interest
in
any
case
in
knowing
who
caused
accidents
or
why
accidents
were
caused.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
but
the
other
interest
is
in
enforcing
its
criminal
laws,
that
interest
is
not
satisfied.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
that
i
don't
know
what
the
state
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
there
is
a
quite
a
lot
of
difference
your
honor
going
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
the
difference
is
that
if
the
statute
read
that
only
people
driving
80
miles
per
hour
need
to
stop
and
give
their
name
and
address,
then
an
80
miles
an
hour
were
per
se
crime
that
perhaps
it
could
be
said
in
that
case
that
the
only
state
interest
was
to
catch
criminals
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
but
here
the
purpose
of
the
statute
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
magic
of
the
having
the
accident
is
that
that
triggers
the
hit
and
run
statute
and
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
we
know
we
don't
know,
whether
or
not
and
you
never
know
why
an
accident
was
caused.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
state
has
a
number
of
interests.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
your
honor
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
having
a
name
and
address
--
now
that
i
just
make
perfectly
clear
that
in
this
case
you
are
only
required
to
give
to
a
third
party,
but
of
course
there
are
other
reporting
statutes,
that
are
not
involved
in
that
case
but
this
interest
--
state
has
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
knowing
number
one,
who
is
involved
in
accidents,
are
they
careful
and
competent
drivers.
we
may
--
as
a
person
is
involved
in
numbers
of
accidents,
he
may
not
be
a
careful
and
competent
driver.
so
it
maybe
necessary
to
revoke
his
license,
which
is
an
interest
totally
unrelated
to
prosecutorial
interest.
we
may
want
to
know
why
your
accident
is
caused,
by
the
accidents
--
if
it's
reported
us
to
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
you
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
if
in
any
regulatory
area,
there
are
going
to
be
criminal
statutes.
it's
presumably
the
legislature's
view
or
congress'
view,
if
it's
a
federal
regulatory
area,
the
criminal
statutes
have
some
deterrent
value
on
the
behavior
of
the
regulated
person.
now,
if
the
state
or
the
congress,
for
example
can't
enforce
income
tax
laws,
if
the
criminal
statutes
cannot
be
enforced
as
a
criminal
matter
or
as
a
practical
matter
then
there
is
no
deterrent
effect.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it's
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
the
statute.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct
your
honor
the
state
may
not.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
but
the
problem
is
that
the
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no
not
--
yes
when
it's
just
given
to
the
one
driver
then
we
may
not
find
out
about
it,
of
course
that
also
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
no
the
real
problem
your
honor
is
that,
if
we
find
out
about
it,
if
the
police
is
happened
by,
which
is
what
happened
in
the
case
in
stockton,
then
--
and
they
discover
either
the
man
was
drunk
or
he
was
an
unlicensed
driver,
then
because
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
privilege
applies
at
the
very
moment,
a
person
is
required
to
stop
and
identify
himself.
if
the
privilege
applies
at
that
very
moment,
then
if
we
happened
to
find
out
a
criminal
violation
is
revealed
at
that
moment,
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
but
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
reason
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
reason
the
driver
stopped
your
honor
was,
because
he
hit
a
car.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
he
alleged
that
he
stopped
because
of
the
statute.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
it's
not
this
case
your
honor.
but
because
this
man
never
stopped
of
course,
but
in
any
case
if
the
privilege
applies
at
the
very
point
a
man
is
required
to
stop,
then
the
state
can
really
cannot
do
anything
about
it
if
a
criminal
prosecution
should
be
revealed.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
said
you
can't
use
that
information
or
the
fruits
of
the
compliance.
now
the
compliance
means
from
the
minute
you
stop
to,
so
that
we
can't
use
the
driver's
name
and
address.
well,
we
submit
a
name
and
address
just
are
not
incriminating,
there
is
nothing
incriminating
about
driving.
there
is
nothing
about
being
--
incriminating
about
being
a
driver.
if
a
criminal
prosecution
is
warranted,
it's
up
to
the
state
to
show
that
an
accident
was
caused
any
--
by
criminal
conduct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
the
--
i
would
have
to
qualify
my
opinion
on
this
your
honor,
there
certainly
is,
there
is
not
any
kind
of
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
agreement
that
he
would
stop.
no,
there
is
not
an
express
waiver
of
any
kind,
but
it
would
be
our
position
that
this
kind
of
duty
has
been
upheld.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
i
am
sorry
as
an
implicit
wavier,
yes.
i
think
it
should
be
perfectly
clear
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
hess
v.
pawloski
has
a
very
great
deal
of
relevance
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
other
decisions
of
this
court
as
our
recalling
illinois
versus
allen
last
year,
the
court
held
that
a
defendant
by
his
conduct
can
waive
his
right
to
be
present
at
a
jury
--
before
the
jury
or
court
hearing.
i
think
the
driving
is
like
any
other
area
of
regulation.
there
are
certain
minimal
requirements
that
must
be
met,
certain
information
that
must
either
be
given
to
a
private
individual
because
of
a
regulatory
interest
or
to
the
government.
and
where
the
information
is
neutral,
and
it
has
legitimate
regulatory
purposes,
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
excuse
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
as
a
practical
matter
the
case
was
never
prosecuted,
your
honor,
because
we
have
always
been
on
appeal
and
so
meanwhile
the
prosecution
on
count
one
has
been
held
on
abeyance
so
there
has
been
nothing
that's
happened.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
would
certainly
think
so
your
honor,
we
are
in
very
difficult
position.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
of
course
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
particular
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
we
believe
it
would
frustrated
in
the
decision
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct,
there
are
--
there
may
well
be
areas
where
a
theory
of
use
restrictions
have
very
valid
purpose
and
can
accommodate
a
government's
need
for
information,
and
the
privilege,
but
the
problem
in
this
case
is
where
accident
occurs,
it's
a
chance
of
thing
it
occurs,
on
this
--
the
duty
must
be
performed
on
the
spot
and
if
the
privilege
applies,
the
minute
there
is
an
accident,
the
minute
there
is
a
duty
to
stop
and
give
your
name
and
address,
we
think
we
are
placed
in
a
virtual
impossible
situations
as
far
as
undertaking
any
kind
of
criminal
law
enforcement.
excuse
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
holding
of
one
court
particular,
bailey
versus
superior
court
which
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
maybe
the
answer
to
your
question
at
least
one
distinction
the
california
courts
have
tried
to
draw.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
any
kind
of
distinction.
certainly
you
cannot
draw
a
distinction
insofar
as
giving
your
name
and
address
is
concerned.
you
cannot
draw
a
distinction
between
the
personal
injury
or
the
property
damage
hit
and
run
statute
and
the
california
courts
have
so
held.
now
in
the
bailey
case
that
court
attempted
to
draw
a
distinction
when
it
said
that
the
duty
to
stop
and
render
aid
and
assistance
was
non-testimonial
and
that
you
could
draw
a
distinction
along
those
lines
whether
or
not
that
distinction
would
hold
water,
should
that
case
or
a
similar
case
come
before
the
state
supreme
court
is
open
to
question.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
kind
of
distinction
to
pursue.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
if
i
might
add
your
honor
that
every
time
from
the
years
ago
when
hit
and
run
statutes
were
attacked
under
this
grounds,
they
have
been
uniformly
upheld.
only
one
reported
case
ever
held
a
hit
and
run
statute
unconstitutional,
and
it
did
so
on
that
ground,
on
the
ground
that
the
driver
was
required
to
stop
and
give
a
full
report
of
the
accident.
that
was
rambrandt
(ph)
versus
city
of
cleveland.
but
in
that
case
the
court
was
very
careful
to
draw
a
distinction
that
anything
less
than
that
was
not
violative
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
recently
the
state
court
of
--
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
their
statute
constitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
also.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
only
burglars
to
stop.
i
mean
if
the
purpose
is
to
have
only
burglars
stop.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
and
in
a
home
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
statute
probably
would
be
unconstitutional,
because
the
only
purpose
of
that
statute
would
be
to
catch
burglars,
burglary
is
per
se
a
crime.
it
occurs
in
a
home.
these
are
all
very
distinguishing
features
from
the
case
we
have
presented
here.
driving
is
not
a
crime.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
it
might
raise
questions.
you
would
have
to,
depending
on
ask
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
why
do
you
want
it?
of
course
drive,
i
think,
the
simple
answer
is
that
driving
just
is
not
a
crime.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
only
purpose
was
to
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
last
question
answered,
we
think
that
the
decision
below
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
u.s.
v.
sullivan
for
the
reason
that
u.s.
v.
sullivan
held
that
taxpayers
must
still
file
a
return
even
though
the
source
of
their
income
was
illegal.
so
that
a
taxpayer
had
to
identify
himself
as
a
taxpayer.
similarly
here,
a
diver
need
to
only
identify
himself
as
a
driver.
it's
identification
is
part
of
a
regulatory
group,
so
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
does
identify,
yes
it
does
identify
yourself
as
a
driver
of
a
car
that
has
been
involved
in
an
accident.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
a
specific
accident,
that's
correct
your
honor.
but,
the
fact
that
you
have
been
in
an
accident
certainly
does
not
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
would
not
be
incriminating
and
in
this
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
fact
that
you
give
the
name
and
address
or
you
have
given
a
name
and
address
as
being
the
driver
in
this
specific
accident
has
nothing
to
do
with
incrimination
in
my
understanding
of
your
question
your
honor.
if
i
might
add
--
if
i
understand
your
question
i
think
that
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
respondent
has
now
conceded
that
it
was
criminal
conduct
that
caused
the
accident.
but,
if
a
trial
had
been
held,
this
is
what
the
trial
would
have
been
all
about
and
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
until
the
concession,
nobody
could
say
that
it
was
caused
by
criminal
conduct,
that
was
the
charge.
but,
the
state
would
have
to
prove
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
a
criminal
trial
could
be
that
there
might
be
a
defense
that
the
respondent
byers
could
show
that
as
he
attempted
to
pass
the
car,
the
driver
of
the
other
car
speeded
up.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
that
the
police
could
ask
that
question.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
it
will
have
to
depend
upon
why
they
were
asking
the
question?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
week's
lag
maybe
sufficient
and
particularly
at
what
the
police
were
trying
to
show
is
that
you
were
hit
and
run
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
that
the
police
could
ask
that
question.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
you
would
certainly
if
i
am
answering
the
question,
this
way
you
would
certainly
have
to
answer
if
you
were
there
right
on
the
spot
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
you
would
have
to
answer
that.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
maybe
a
different
case
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
i
think
--
could
the
state
make
that
a
crime?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
they
could.
i
think
that
a
lot
would
have
to
depend
upon
that
what
were
the
circumstances.
then
i
think
you
get
into
other
kinds
of
cases.
when
you
have
the
accident
scene,
i
mean
you
have
an
immediate
event
that
requires
a
person
to
answer,
i
mean,
you
have
on
this
probable
cause
at
that
point
where
you
have
a
person
in
their
home
you
might
have
--
i
think
your
problems
may
be
different,
but
i
don't
think
we
--
in
order
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
on
and
consider
that
other
case.
i
think
it's
enough
that
if
there
--
you
are
on
the
scene
of
the
accident,
the
police
can
require
you
to
show
your
license,
they
can
require
you
to
answer.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
that
the
problems
maybe
entirely
different.
i
think
it
raises
entirely
different
kinds
of
issues,
entirely
different
kinds
of
considerations
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
under
california
law,
under
various
statutes,
he
could
be
required
to
answer.
it
would
under
--
he
could
be
required
to
answer,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
if
the
reports
are
available
to
persons
involved
in
accidents.
they
are
kept
confidential
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
have
some
interest
in
seeing
the
report.
if
i
might
also
add
your
honor
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
oh,
certainly
and
i
think
that
when
you
pose
the
question,
isn't
this
the
exact
same
case
as
when
you
are
filling
out
a
license
or
a
vehicle
registration
application.
i
think
the
answer
is,
yes
this
is
the
same
case.
identification
is
involved.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
yes,
but
if
your
license
is
seen,
then
it
is
just
--
you
just
found
out
who
filed
out
the
application.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
except
under
the
theory
the
state
supreme
court
i
mean
it
could
be
the
case
that
if
you
are
wanted
for
another
crime,
you
are
not
required
to
show
your
license
because
that
might
incriminate
you
for
reasons
unrelated
to
the
accident
at
all.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
your
honor,
are
you
referring
to
the
link
in
a
chain
kind
of
analysis?
that
line,
yes.
we
are
familiar
with
that
line
of
cases
and
it
was
that
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
--
the
use
of
that
certainly
has
been
considered.
but
usually
when
it
has
been
considered,
it
has
been
considered
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
proceeding
or
legislative
committee
proceeding
where
the
very
fact
that
a
witness
is
called
before
the
court
or
the
legislature
may
--
there
is
official
attention
has
been
focused.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
in
any
criminal
case.
if
i
might
add
in
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
line
of
cases
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
i
think
there
are
two
cases
that
come
--
are
two
lines
of
cases
that
immediately
come
to
mind
in
answering
your
question.
the
first
is
the
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes
line
of
cases
in
talking
about
the
link
of
the
chain
says
that
the
information
required
must
constitute
a
substantial
link
in
the
chain.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
name
and
address,
no
your
honor.
it's
not
a
crime
to
be
in
an
accident.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
could
be
caused
by
any
number
of
reasons.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well,
if
we
are
going
to
extend
the
link
and
the
chain
analysis
endlessly,
then
it
would
mean
that
u.s.
in
u.s.
v.
sullivan
that
decision
should
have
gone
the
other
way
because
the
fact
that
a
taxpayer
files
is
required
to
file
a
tax
return
in
which
by
the
fact
that
he
states
the
source
of
his
income
or
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
state
the
source
of
his
income.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
sullivan
case
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
and
we
think
that
we
have
the
exact
same
situation
in
this
case
your
honor.
we
are
not
asking
the
driver
to
state
how
many
drinks
did
you
have
or
had
your
been
drinking
prior
to
the
accident.
the
driver
is
only
required
to
say
that
he
was
a
driver
and
it's
a
same
thing
--
same
case
also
as
shapiro
versus
united
states
which
we
referred
to
in
our
briefs
embodying
the
required
records
doctrine
where
you
have
a
regulatory
program.
the
information
required
is
essential
for
the
regulatory
program
and
in
this
case,
it's
even
more
neutral
kind
than
that
required
in
shapiro
versus
united
states,
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
pardon
me.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
respondent
in
this
case?
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
your
honor.
this
case
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
there
was
a
charge
made
against
him.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
charge
was
failure
to
pass
to
the
left
safely.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
is
an
offense
under
the
laws
of
california.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
mwell,
nothing
has
happened
yet
except
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
man
--
it
would
be
unfair
to
try
the
respondent
byers.
now,
our
position
--
ms.
louise
h.
renne
the
state
did
charge
him,
but
the
record
doesn't
show
how
the
state
found
out,
it
was
this
man.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
well
they
did
because
at
the
trial,
the
facts
of
what
actually
occurred
would
have
come
out.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
yes,
the
state
did
not
find
out.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
he
might
be
turned
loose.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
that
is
correct,
that
has
been
a
statement
law.
the
problem
is
how
do
you
apply
link
in
the
chain.
i
am
reminded
of
the
one
of
the
nail,
the
shoe
was
lost,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
every
piece
of
information
that
a
person
can
be
required
give,
a
manufacturer
has
to
label
his
goods,
the
physician
has
to
report
nature
and
causes
of
accident,
every
piece
of
information,
a
person
could
be
required
to
give,
could
lead
to
some
conceivable
criminal
charge.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
it
did
in
this
case.
well,
in
this
case
he
didn't
stop,
so
it
didn't.
ms.
louise
h.
renne
no,
at
the
trial,
we
would
have
found
out
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty
.he
now
says
he
was,
but
we
didn't
know
it
for
sure
earlier.
i
just
would
finally
like
to
add
in
conclusion
that
insofar
as
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
there
is
a
substantial
shadow
of
suspicion
cast
upon
people
in
accident,
that
that
determination
is
unsubstantiated
by
the
record.
there
is
no
evidence.
this
case
arose
on
the
pleadings
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
the
state
supreme
court
in
our
view,
did
not
rest
on
any
particular
provisions
of
california
law.
it
seemed
to
believe
it
was
compelled
to
do
so
in
cases
of
marchetti,
grosso
and
haynes.
we
think
those
cases
are
distinguishable
because
of
the
very
facts
involved
in
those
cases
and
not
here.
