justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
about
a
statute
that
if
you
go
over
80
miles
and
hour,
you
have
to
give
a
name
and
address,
does
that
help
in
any
part?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
my
question
is
what's
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned,
these
are
two
traffic
violations.
all
the
state
is
interested
in
i
assume
with
the
traffic
violation.
you
are
not
interested
to
damage
the
car,
that's
civil,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
drive
80
miles
an
hour
and
strike
a
car,
just
takes
off
the
middle
piece
of
thing,
just
leave
the
name
and
address.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what's
the
magic
of
having
an
accident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
requires
him
to
admit
that
the
he
committed
the
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
you
are
interested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
see
the
interest
of
the
state
in
seeing
through
that
citizen
of
the
state
who
caused
damage,
who
shall
be
able
to
litigate,
know
who
did
it.
but
i
don't
see
the
interest
of
the
state
in
having
that
name
and
address
for
any
prosecutorial
purpose
of
any
kind.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
interested
in
the
prosecutorial
use
of
it
which
is
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
interest
and
the
fact
that
you
want
statistics
that
doesn't
bother
me
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
fact
that
you
want
to
prosecute
this
man,
does
worry
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
criminal
statute
here
is
failure
to
leave
your
name
and
address?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
you
leave
your
name
and
address,
is
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
because
i
thought
you
said
that
if
you
give
it
to
the
guy
with
the
car,
the
state
will
never
know
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
good
is
that
to
the
state,
no
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
won't
find
out
about
it
to
prosecute
the
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
your
stockton
case
what
do
you
need
his
name
and
address
for,
you
said
the
police
picked
him
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
was
(inaudible)
drunk.
so
why
you
need
this
little
slip
of
paper
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
need
it
to
prosecute
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
he
(inaudible)
without
the
statute,
he
would
have
stopped.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
definitely
not
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
have
admit
that.
all
he
had
to
say
was
i
was
involved
in
an
accident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
2002
is
driver
of
any
vehicle
involved
in
an
accident
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
are
your
appealing
from
this
opinion,
this
judgment
of
the
california
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
there
is
an
accident
and
the
police
come
up
and
say,
give
me
your
driver's
license,
you
don't
have
to
give
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don't.
you
want
that
statute
to
go
through.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
california
have
a
statute
which
require
you
to
show
your
driver's
license?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
make
waves
--
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
license
tag?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
they
can
use
all
of
the
information
that's
on
the
registration
of
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
can't
i
say
like
and
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
my
address
because
some
time
in
future
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
i
give
you
my
address,
so
you
can
come
and
pick
me
up,
when
i
have
that
accident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
--
what
i
am
worried
about
frankly
is,
if
you
can
get
this
information,
by
the
means
of
your
tags,
your
driver's
license
or
any
other
information,
what's
wrong
with
--
it
means
that
you
have
given
from
your
own
mouth
to
quote
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
from
your
own
mouth
or
i
am
wrong,
your
own
handwriting
on
the
application?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
law
requires
him
to
give
an
official
report
to
the
state
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
involved
driver
of
this
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
fill
out
application,
you
don't
say
that
you
were
the
driver
of
the
car
that
had
the
accident,
there
is
a
difference
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
then
say
the
car
was
stolen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
if
you
give
the
name
and
say
well,
i
don't
think
it's
important.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
about
a

that
if
