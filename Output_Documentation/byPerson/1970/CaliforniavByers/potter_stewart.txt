justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
that
the
use
restriction
would
include
any
reliance
by
the
state
on
the
fact
that
this
was
the
man
who
--
this
was
the
name
of
the
man
who
caused
the
damage?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
your
submission
general
renne
as
i
understand
it
that,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
this
case
means
that
if
a
driver
damages
property
and
stops
along,
leaves
his
name,
he
first
of
all
of
course
is
not
guilty
of
violation
of
the
hit
and
run
statute
and
secondly
he
immunizes
himself
from
any
prosecution
for
any
other
offense,
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
a
logical
extension
of
that
might
be
--
it
could
be
argued
that
he
also
immunizes
himself
from
any
subsequent
tort
liability
if
it
can
be
shown
that
it
resulted
from
his
identification
as
a
result
of
his
stopping
and
leaving
his
name?
justice
potter
stewart
the
way
i
have
gotten
there
so
far
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
general
renne,
when
a
person
gets
a
license
to
drive
on
the
roads
of
your
state,
is
there
--
are
there
any
explicit
conditions
imposed
or
anything,
any
application
he
signs
insofar
as
obeying
the
laws
of
the
state,
anything
along
those
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
any
kind
of
expressive
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
as
an
implicit
waiver,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
hess
against
pawloski
has
maybe
some
slight
relevance,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
appear
how
they
--
since
he
did
not
obey
the
hit
and
run
statute,
does
it
appear
how
they
knew
--
how
the
state
knew
who
he
was
when
the
trial
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
criminal
case?
