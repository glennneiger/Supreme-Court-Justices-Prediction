mr.
stanley
e.
preiser
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wanted
to
point
just
a
few
things
in
addition
to
the
solicitor
general
and
that
is
that
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
i
think
in
the
appeal,
the
thrust
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
was
that
there
was
no
formal
plan.
now,
the
evidence
conclusively
establishes
there
was
a
relocation
program
that
congressional
intent
was
being
carried
out.
everything
that
would
have
been
replied
by
the
plan
was
done.
even
before
the
1968
act
was
continued
beyond
the
68
act.
the
case
was
tried
on
that
theory
on
the
technicality
was
there
a
plan,
a
former
plan.
we
concede
there
was
not.
secondly,
on
the
evidence
of
mr.
a.
bliss,
their
major
witness,
theory
was
that
because
the
charleston
urban
renewal
would
be
displacing
people
at
about
the
same
time.
they
would
not
be
adequate
housing.
the
fact,
the
matter
is
that
the
charleston-irvine
renewal
did
not
in
68,
69,
70,
and
have
not
yet
started,
some
almost
three
years
later
displacing
anyone.
so,
there
was
no
competition
for
the
adequate
housing.
the
facts
further
conclusively
established
that
on
any
given
day,
there
were
80
houses
available.
from
the
triangle
district,
some
30
persons
lived
in
the
orlando
hotel
which
was
substandard.
there
were,
at
that
time
250
available
hotel
rooms
within
one
mile
and
so,
it
is
our
position
at
the
trial
and
still
is,
there
was
no
discrimination.
there
was
adequate
housing.
we
complied
with
every
requirement
of
the
act
except
the
technicality
of
filing
the
formal
plan.
we
feel
that
that
should
be
--
mr.
stanley
e.
preiser
sir?
mr.
stanley
e.
preiser
yes,
we
say
the
--
it’s
not
required
--
mr.
stanley
e.
preiser
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
no
plan.
in
our
view,
we
say
we
complied
with
that.
other
requirement
of
the
statute
and
of
all
the
memorandums,
and
with
that,
we
feel
that
the
matter
is
disposed
off,
whatever
they
complained
about
below
never
happened.
so,
we
think
that
the
matter
has
in
fact
become
moot,
if
their
position
was
correct
at
all
to
begin
with.
and
that’s
all
i
had
to
say,
i
want
to
save
this
time.
