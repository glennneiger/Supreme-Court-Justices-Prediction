mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
without
an
opinion.
but
i
might
add
that
there
were
dissenting
opinion
by
the
judges
sobeloff
and
winter
which
at
some
length
set
forth
what
in
their
view
was
the
reasoning
and
position
of
the
majority
who
did
not
write
an
opinion.
there
have
been
a
number
of
changes
in
the
law
and
the
circumstances
of
petitioners,
since
this
case
was
filed
and
the
federal
respondent
suggest
in
their
brief
while
“the
case
is
technically
not
moot”,
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
adjudicate
the
complex
issues
originally
raised
by
this
case,
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
are
perhaps
just
the
handful
there
at
this
moment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
half
a
dozen.
our
position
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
how
many
were
there
at
the
time
when
the
case
is
filed,
approximately
300.
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
position
is
that
the
changes
in
the
facts
and
the
changes
in
law
determined
only
the
form
of
the
remedy
and
that
the
court
of
equity
has
the
historic
flexibility
that
equity
had
demonstrated
to
adapt
relief
to
the
circumstances.
but
if
the
changes
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
whether
rights
were
violated
and
whether
petitioners
were
entitled
to
any
remedy
at
all.
the
decision
may
have
a
practical
effect
on
the
rights
of
the
300
former
residents
of
the
triangle
whom
i
just
referred
to
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question.
and
as
the
brief
of
amicus,
national
housing
and
economic
development
law
project
states,
perhaps
100,000
others
throughout
the
nation
who
are
similarly
situated.
now,
i
would
like
to
describe
the
principal
changes
that
have
taken
place
since
the
case
was
filed.
the
case
involves
an
interstate
highway
being
built
through
an
area
known
as
the
triangle,
a
poor,
mostly
black
section
of
charleston,
west
virginia.
in
1968
when
the
case
was
file,
there
existed,
but
since
then
has
been
recently
been
repealed
of
the
1968
relocation
amendments
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act
and
that’s
statute
set
forth
completely
in
our
brief.
but
section
502
which
is
one
of
the
key
sections
of
the
statutes
says
if
the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
project
which
will
cause
displacement
unless
he
receives
satisfactory
assurances
from
the
state
highway
department
that
relocation
meeting
certain
standards
with
regard
to
safety
sanitation
and
decency
will
be
furnished
to
persons
being
displaced.
and
elsewhere
in
the
statute
relocation
is
provided
for.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
has
just
been
repealed
by
the
uniform
relocation
act
which
is
set
forth
at
length
in
our
supplemental
brief
and
it’s
discussed
in
that
brief
mr.
justice
brennan.
also
in
effect,
in
1968
was
im8168,
im
standing
for
instructional
memorandum
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
was
a
regulation
of
the
department
of
transportation,
which
elaborated
on
requirements
of
the
statute,
particularly
with
regard
to
fact
gathering
and
formulating
a
relocation
plan.
and
at
the
time
of
suit,
when
these
statute
and
these
regulations
were
in
effect,
they
were
approximately
10
persons
in
the
path
of
the
triangle.
now,
the
position
of
the
federal
respondents
at
that
time
and
now
is
that
the
1968
relocation
amendments
and
the
regulation
8168
did
not
apply
because
they
stated
that
these
do
not
apply
to
areas
where
right-of-way
acquisition
was
approved
prior
to
1968,
and
right-of-way
acquisition
in
this
case
had
been
approved
prior
to
1968.
and
that
is
their
position
even
though
other
approvals,
that
is
approvals
for
clearance
at
construction
had
not
yet
been
given.
now,
the
fact
is
exactly
how
many
people,
they
are
not
entirely
precise
but
a
discovery
was
denied
before
trial
in
the
court
below.b
ut
perhaps
no
one
had
moved
from
the
triangle
as
of
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
1968
statute
and
only
a
few
had
moved
and
we
know
this
by
the
time
of
suit.
now,
there
have
been
several
other
changes
in
the
law
which
i
would
like
to
advert
to
only
briefly
in
they
are
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief
and
that
is
in
1970,
before
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
something
called
a
circular
memorandum
adopted
in
april
10th
which
in
judge
sobeloff's
view
and
as
he
elaborates
in
his
decision
essentially
repealed
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
the
interpretation
in
im68
which
limited
to
authorization
to
acquire
right-of-way
which
were
approved
after
the
passage
of
the
statute
and
so
that’s
elaborated
in
the
brief
and
perhaps
i
will
come
to
this
term
late
in
the
argument.
and
nevertheless,
people
kept
moving
out.
and
in
may
1970,
when
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
number
in
the
triangle
was
down
to
262.
in
july
1970
when
the
case
was
on
rehearing,
the
number
was
down
to
a
150.
in
december
1970,
it
was
down
at
65.
in
january
of
this
year,
it
was
down
to
a
half
dozen
but
down
to
35
but
now
it
is
down
to
approximately
about
a
half
a
dozen.
and
now
as
of
january
2,
1971,
there
has
been
enacted
the
uniform
relocation
act
which
is
set
forth
in
our
supplemental
brief,
and
which
also
repealed
the
1968
relocation
provisions.
the
uniform
relocation
act
applies
to
relocation
from
all
sorts
of
displacements
or
a
variety
of
displacements,
not
merely
displacements
for
highway
construction.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
right
and
that
express
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
has
relevancy
as
to
the
persons
who
had
not
yet
moved.
i
mean,
as
of
the
time
its
adoption.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
we
have
relevancy
if
they
were
be
protected
by
the
68
statute.
i'm
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
there
is
a
matter
of
fact
as
we
would
argue
it,
they
really
not
very
material
differences.
certainly,
if
you
view
the
68
act
along
the
with
the
im
8168,
the
regulation,
the
uniform
relocation
act
of
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i
would
say
you
would
not
because
i
would
say
this
case
is
determined
by
the
68
act.
now,
i
would
like
to
argue
to
the
court
what
i
believe
that’s
the
case.
now,
if
assurances
were
required
by
the
1968
statute
and
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
united
states
is
wrong.
and
they
claim,
it
was
to
required
by
im
8168
because
their
cut-off
date
which
rests
on
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
invalid,
10
petitioner’s
rights
were
violated.
the
violation
of
those
rights
would
give
rise
to
a
remedy
and
the
question
then
would
be,
what
is
that
remedy?
now
this
time
obviously,
the
remedy
in
the
statute
in
the
regulation
would
not
make
sense.
assurances
at
this
point,
now
that
almost
everybody
has
been
moved
out
and
a
plan
that
would
everybody
has
been
moved
out
would
not
be
the
appropriate
thing
to
do.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
court
of
equity
couldn’t
device
what
would
be
the
appropriate
thing
to
do.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
if
the
rights
were
violated,
then
the
respondents
would
have
an
obligation
to
go
and
find
the
people
who
have
been
dislocated.
find
out
whether
they
have
been
located
in
housing
which
met
the
standards
required
by
statute,
and
if
not
relocate
them.
and
the
state
respondents
in
their
brief
seem
to
concede
that
this
would
be
inappropriate
form
of
relief
if
we
can
find
that
there
was
a
substantive
legal
wrong
done
at
the
time.
and
therefore,
the
question
is,
were
the
rights
violated
by
the
1968
statute?
since,
perhaps
everyone
was
on
the
site
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
but
it
would
be
decisive
of
this
case
if
it
were
applicable.
and
we
submit
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
applicability.
and
if
we
are
correct,
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
courts
below
were
in
error.
it
is
--
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
question
that
no
assurances
were
given
as
required
by
the
1968
statute;
that’s
the
government’s
position
as
set
forth
in
their
brief
and
it's
their
position,
no
assurances
were
given
because
no
assurances
were
required.
and
secondly,
the
recent
decision
of
this
court,
the
overton
park
case
comes
into
play
because
the
assurances
that
should
have
been
given,
if
indeed
they
should
been
given,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
they
should
have
been,
would
have
constituted
the
administrative
record
upon
which
the
court
below,
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
made
its
appraisal.
not
any
de
novo
hearing
of
calling
in
witnesses
who've
been
involved
in
the
transactions,
but
a
hearing
on
the
administrative
record.
and
that
indeed
is
also,
i
gather
the
government’s
position
because
in
their
brief,
i
believe
on
page
42
or
46,
they
say
that
those
assurances,
page
46,
would
have
constituted
the
administrative
record
but
there
were
no
such
assurances
because
they
were
not
required.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say,
no,
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
trial
court
should
have
had
an
administrative
record
before
it
and
it
should
have
appraised
that
administrative
record.
it
did
not
have
an
administrative
record
before
because
the
assurances
which
would
have
constituted
that
record
were
not
given,
because
it
was
the
position
of
the
government
under
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
they
were
not
required.
we
submit
that
that
interpretation,
if
the
statute
was
incorrect,
then
we’d
like
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
quite
clearly
that
interpretation
was
incorrect.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
we
do
make
such
a
claim
and
we
could
sustain
that
if
it
were
necessary
to
do
that
upon
a
de
novo
record,
and
indeed,
there’s
a
considerable
argument
in
our
brief
as
to
how
the
facts
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
are
to
the
contrary,
but
those
findings
we
think,
are
first
of
all,
clearly
erroneous
and
this
were
an
ordinary
kind
of
trial
but
clearly
irrelevant
and
improper
because
they
were
not
made
upon
administrative
record
such
as
this
court
is
indicated
would
be
required
in
the
overton
park
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
the
1968
amendments
were
applicable
and
we
find
this
in
just
about
all
the
sources
one
can
find
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
and
the
purpose
of
the
1968
relocation
amendments.
now,
we
must
remember,
it’s
the
government’s
argument
that
the
statute
is
not
applicable
because
it
does
not
apply
to
rights-of-way
which
will
authorized
prior
to
the
adoption
of
a
statute.
and
the
first
thing,
we
must
notice,
this
is
manufactured
out
of
nothing.
one
reads
the
statute
in
vain,
defines
such
a
limitation,
such
a
limitation
appears
nowhere
and
is
not
even
suggested
anywhere
in
the
statute.
if
one
looks
at
the
language
of
the
statute
now,
section
501
which
is
the
declaration
of
policy,
it
says,
congress
hereby
--
this
is
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
congress
hereby
declares
a
prompt
and
equitable
relocation
and
reestablishment
of
persons,
businesses
and
so
forth
is
necessary.
it
speaks
about
relocation,
there's
nowhere
any
cut-off
date
as
to
when
rights
will
authorize
because
as
the
briefs
of
all
parties
indicate,
the
time
between
authorization
of
right-of-way
and
construction
of
relocation
is
sometimes
a
period
of
very
many
years.
if
we
look
at
section
511
(1d)
(3)
of
the
statute
which
defines
a
displaced
person,
we
find
that
displaced
person
defined
as,
any
person
who
meet
moves
from
real
property
on
or
after
the
effect
of
date
of
this
chapter,
as
result
of
the
acquisition
or
reasonable
expectation
of
acquisition
of
such
real
property.
so
again,
that
not
only
makes
no
reference
to
projects
who
were
rights-of-way
or
approved
or
acquired
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
it
refers
to
persons
being
moved
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
now,
the
statute
also
has
relocation
payment
provisions.
it
requires
not
only
relocation
assistance
but
relocation
payment.
the
time
factors
in
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
refer
to
relocation
payment
and
relocation
assistance
without
any
discrimination
or
differentiation
between
the
two
and
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
that
relocation
payments
maybe
made
to
the
petitioners
here
and
indeed
were
made
to
the
petitioners
here.
yet,
there
is
no
reason
and
nothing
anyone
can
find
in
the
statute
to
differentiate
between
them.
now,
we
go
back
to
the
genesis
of
the
statute.
this
statute
came
out
of
a
1967
study
which
was
ordered
by
a
1966
statute
passed
by
congress.
and
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief,
the
relocation
assistance
study
statute
appears,
2
and
3
of
the
appendix
of
the
brief,
and
that
calls
for
a
full
and
complete
study,
an
investigation
for
the
purpose
of
the
determining
what
action
can
and
should
be
taken
to
provide
additional
assistance
for
the
relocation
or
reestablishment
of
persons
and
so
forth
to
be
displaced
by
construction
of
projects
on
a
federal-aid
highway
systems.
again,
it
looks
forward
to
dealing
with
people
who
are
going
to
be
relocated.
and
then,
if
we
look
back
to
the
1962
statute
which
is
the
1968
statute
replaced,
we
find
and
this
is
on
section
133
(e),
which
is
on
page
2
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
a
limitation
such
as
is
not
found
in
the
1968
statute
and
section
e
says,
this
section
shall
apply
only
with
respect
to
projects
approved
under
section
106
of
this
title
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
section.
no
such
provision
is
found
on
the
1968
statute.
now,
the
new
statute,
the
1968
statute
came
out
of
crisis
caused
by
the
need
to
relocate
large
numbers
of
persons
who
were
being
displaced
because
highways
were
being
built
through
their
homes.
now,
the
national
highway
system
which
gave
rise
to
this
problem
was
to
be
41,000
miles
in
length.
at
the
time,
the
1961
statutes
were
adopted;
32,000
miles
had
been
built.
9,000
miles
remained
to
be
built.
of
the
9,000
miles,
remained
to
be
built;
8,500
miles
had
already
had
their
rights-of-way
authorized.
now,
that
would
mean
congress
went
to
all
this
trouble
and
passed
this
enormous
apparatus
and
the
statute
made
all
this
requirements
with
regard
only
to
500
miles,
and
it
just
doesn’t
make
any
sense.
now,
it
would
mean
that
congress
engaged
in
a
few
--
we
would
think
that
the
government
has
fairly
well
described
the
reason
for
the
position
which
was
taken.
in
page
424
of
the
record,
they’re
willing
to
pay
relocation
payments
because
after
all
the
payment
and
monies
are
fairly
simple
and
uncomplicated
and
unmessy
act.
mr.
carpenter,
the
division
right-of-way
officer
testifies
on
page
424
about
what
it
would
mean
to
have
to
actually
provide
the
relocation.
and
he
says,
“certainly,
it
would
have
been
putting
another
here
shirt
on
the
state
to
ask
them
to
give
us
a
formal
submission
on
the
record
of
what
they
are
already
doing.
they
would
have
had
to
stop
work,
put
several
people
on
this
to
formalize
it,
submit
it
to
me,
have
my
people
review
it,
and
give
them
approval
back.
it
would
have
served
no
practical
purpose.”
but
on
the
contrary,
congress
ordered
that
that's
just
what
had
to
be
done.
congress
didn’t
want
anybody
to
wear
a
here
shirt,
but
congress
wanted
that
the
state
and
federal
authorities
concerned
should
actually
attend
to
the
difficult
and
perhaps
unpleasant
but
necessary
job
of
relocation.
now,
the
courts
below
accepted
the
cut-off
date,
that
is
the
cut-off
date
as
to
high
right-of-way
acquisition
which
had
been
approved
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1968
statute,
and
he
accepted
that
as
an
authoritative
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute.
well,
everyone
knows
that
administrative
agencies
make
interpretations
of
statutes
and
those
interpretations
are
entitled
to
considerable
and
often
conclusive
way.
but
that
is
only
so
when
those
interpretations
come
out
of
the
practicalities
of
the
situation,
some
special
experience,
some
involvement
with
the
operation
of
a
statute
and
a
program,
which
would
lend
a
special
authority
to
that
kind
of
interpretation.
so
far
as
the
interpretation
of
the
plain
language
of
a
statute
and
its
legislative
history
and
its
purpose,
courts
and
lawyers
do
that
as
well
as
administrators
and
we
submit
that
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
point
to
the
fact
that
congress
intended
to
protect
people
who
are
going
to
be
relocated
and
not
just
the
minuscule
small
amount
of
people
who
are
going
to
be
on
the
way
of
the
national
highway
system.
now,
if
this
1968
statute
is
applicable
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
need
to
go
on
to
the
1970
regulations,
though
we
argue
that
in
our
brief,
judge
sobeloff
sets
forth
the
reason
why
those
protect
the
rights
of
at
least
those
who
are
on
the
site
as
of
the
time,
the
adoption
of
those
regulations
under
the
doctrine
of
the
fourth
case
or
the
71
statute
which
would
protect
the
rights
of
those
--
that
handful
who
remain
on
the
site
after
the
adoption
of
the
71
statute,
or
the
constitutional
question.
but
indeed,
the
constitutional
question
provides
an
additional
reason
what
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
we
have
argued
is
we
believe
correct.
and
that
is
the
statutory
interpretation
which
we
urge
would
avoid
the
decision
of
the
constitutional
question
and
it
is
a
settled
cannon
of
statutory
construction,
that
is
something
which
courts
strive
to
do.
and
so
for
the
reasons
given,
we
would
submit
that
the
petitioners
who
are
in
the
way
of
the
highway
1968
are
entitled
to
protection
of
the
1968
statute,
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
instructional
memorandum.
if
the
case
is
not
moot,
it
involves
these
petitioners
as
well
as
many
others
situated
throughout
the
country
and
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
what
form
of
relief
shall
be
granted,
and
that
the
court
of
equity
can
figure
that
out.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fact
is
the
statute
was
not
complied
with.
the
assurances
that
are
required
by
a
statute
were
not
given,
a
plan
that
was
required
according
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
not
filed.
i
might
add,
there
was
indeed
a
plan
filed,
prepared
for
this
litigation,
very
much
like
the
litigation
affidavits
in
overton
park
and
that
was
dismissed
by
the
federal
authorities
as
half
a
plan
and
really
not
adequate.
the
reason
that
the
congress
enacted
a
statute
and
the
department
adopted
regulations
was
because
precisely
the
kind
of
practices
that
are
going
on
here,
that
is
informal
relocation
taking
the
word
of
the
various
departments
acting
in
a
non-structured,
non-reviewable
way,
not
on
any
record
which
a
court
can
review
was
deemed
adequate
and
that
is
why,
the
statute
was
adopted
and
the
regulations
implementing
were
adopted.
that
is
what
happened
here.
the
court
made
a
de
novo
review
on
the
basis
of
ad
hoc,
post
hoc
rationalizations,
testimony
put
on
by
witnesses,
came
to
the
court
after
the
event
not
on
administrative
record
which
is
exactly
what
this
statute
was
designed
to
provide.
and
we
submit
there's
been
no
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
relief
as
to
the
326
persons
who
originally
were
on
the
side
of
the
triangle
would
be
something
in
the
general
nature
of
what
the
state
respondents
and
we
agree
would
be
appropriate.
i
mean,
they
agree
that
if
they
lose
the
case,
this
would
be
appropriate
and
that
is
that
the
state
authorities
ought
to
find
where
these
people
had
been
relocated
to.
and
in
fact,
they
say
they
are
even
somewhat
in
the
process
of
doing
that
right
now
and
find
out
whether
or
not
the
housing
in
which
they
now
live
meets
the
statutory
standards.
if
it
does
not
meet
the
statutory
standards
then
they
ought
to
take
such
steps
as
unnecessary
to
relocate
these
people
in
statutory
housing.
now,
that’s
not
the
relief
provided
for
in
the
statute
but
that
is
an
adaptation
of
it
which
is
appropriate
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
of
course,
there
would
be
a
rule
of
law
coming
out
of
this
case
which
would
protect
the
other
persons
in
the
way
of
the
highway.
i
might
say
there’s
some
difference
in
opinion
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
would
apply
to
all
326
people
who
were
in
the
trial.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
there
are
some
of
them
may
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
they
are
not
members
of
this
class
and
not
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
right.
that’s
right
and
there
are
326.
now,
there
is
some
difference
between
us
on
the
division
of
the
8,500
and
500
out
of
the
9,000
miles.
we
have
cited
in
our
on
page
29,
the
senate
committee
report,
and
i
believe
or
at
least,
i
hope
you
will
find
to
that
report
that
approximately
8,500
miles
had
already
been
authorized.
and
therefore,
if
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
prevails,
only
persons
in
the
remaining
500
miles
would
be
covered,
but
even
those
of
500
miles
through
cities
involves
a
very
considerable
number
of
people.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia
without
an
opinion.
but
i
might
add
that
there
were
dissenting
opinion
by
the
judges
sobeloff
and
winter
which
at
some
length
set
forth
what
in
their
view
was
the
reasoning
and
position
of
the
majority
who
did
not
write
an
opinion.
there
have
been
a
number
of
changes
in
the
law
and
the
circumstances
of
petitioners,
since
this
case
was
filed
and
the
federal
respondent
suggest
in
their
brief
while
“the
case
is
technically
not
moot”,
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
adjudicate
the
complex
issues
originally
raised
by
this
case,
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
are
perhaps
just
the
handful
there
at
this
moment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
half
a
dozen.
our
position
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
how
many
were
there
at
the
time
when
the
case
is
filed,
approximately
300.
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
position
is
that
the
changes
in
the
facts
and
the
changes
in
law
determined
only
the
form
of
the
remedy
and
that
the
court
of
equity
has
the
historic
flexibility
that
equity
had
demonstrated
to
adapt
relief
to
the
circumstances.
but
if
the
changes
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
whether
rights
were
violated
and
whether
petitioners
were
entitled
to
any
remedy
at
all.
the
decision
may
have
a
practical
effect
on
the
rights
of
the
300
former
residents
of
the
triangle
whom
i
just
referred
to
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question.
and
as
the
brief
of
amicus,
national
housing
and
economic
development
law
project
states,
perhaps
100,000
others
throughout
the
nation
who
are
similarly
situated.
now,
i
would
like
to
describe
the
principal
changes
that
have
taken
place
since
the
case
was
filed.
the
case
involves
an
interstate
highway
being
built
through
an
area
known
as
the
triangle,
a
poor,
mostly
black
section
of
charleston,
west
virginia.
in
1968
when
the
case
was
file,
there
existed,
but
since
then
has
been
recently
been
repealed
of
the
1968
relocation
amendments
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act
and
that’s
statute
set
forth
completely
in
our
brief.
but
section
502
which
is
one
of
the
key
sections
of
the
statutes
says
if
the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
project
which
will
cause
displacement
unless
he
receives
satisfactory
assurances
from
the
state
highway
department
that
relocation
meeting
certain
standards
with
regard
to
safety
sanitation
and
decency
will
be
furnished
to
persons
being
displaced.
and
elsewhere
in
the
statute
relocation
is
provided
for.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
has
just
been
repealed
by
the
uniform
relocation
act
which
is
set
forth
at
length
in
our
supplemental
brief
and
it’s
discussed
in
that
brief
mr.
justice
brennan.
also
in
effect,
in
1968
was
im8168,
im
standing
for
instructional
memorandum
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
was
a
regulation
of
the
department
of
transportation,
which
elaborated
on
requirements
of
the
statute,
particularly
with
regard
to
fact
gathering
and
formulating
a
relocation
plan.
and
at
the
time
of
suit,
when
these
statute
and
these
regulations
were
in
effect,
they
were
approximately
10
persons
in
the
path
of
the
triangle.
now,
the
position
of
the
federal
respondents
at
that
time
and
now
is
that
the
1968
relocation
amendments
and
the
regulation
8168
did
not
apply
because
they
stated
that
these
do
not
apply
to
areas
where
right-of-way
acquisition
was
approved
prior
to
1968,
and
right-of-way
acquisition
in
this
case
had
been
approved
prior
to
1968.
and
that
is
their
position
even
though
other
approvals,
that
is
approvals
for
clearance
at
construction
had
not
yet
been
given.
now,
the
fact
is
exactly
how
many
people,
they
are
not
entirely
precise
but
a
discovery
was
denied
before
trial
in
the
court
below.b
ut
perhaps
no
one
had
moved
from
the
triangle
as
of
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
1968
statute
and
only
a
few
had
moved
and
we
know
this
by
the
time
of
suit.
now,
there
have
been
several
other
changes
in
the
law
which
i
would
like
to
advert
to
only
briefly
in
they
are
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief
and
that
is
in
1970,
before
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
something
called
a
circular
memorandum
adopted
in
april
10th
which
in
judge
sobeloff's
view
and
as
he
elaborates
in
his
decision
essentially
repealed
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
the
interpretation
in
im68
which
limited
to
authorization
to
acquire
right-of-way
which
were
approved
after
the
passage
of
the
statute
and
so
that’s
elaborated
in
the
brief
and
perhaps
i
will
come
to
this
term
late
in
the
argument.
and
nevertheless,
people
kept
moving
out.
and
in
may
1970,
when
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
number
in
the
triangle
was
down
to
262.
in
july
1970
when
the
case
was
on
rehearing,
the
number
was
down
to
a
150.
in
december
1970,
it
was
down
at
65.
in
january
of
this
year,
it
was
down
to
a
half
dozen
but
down
to
35
but
now
it
is
down
to
approximately
about
a
half
a
dozen.
and
now
as
of
january
2,
1971,
there
has
been
enacted
the
uniform
relocation
act
which
is
set
forth
in
our
supplemental
brief,
and
which
also
repealed
the
1968
relocation
provisions.
the
uniform
relocation
act
applies
to
relocation
from
all
sorts
of
displacements
or
a
variety
of
displacements,
not
merely
displacements
for
highway
construction.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
right
and
that
express
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
has
relevancy
as
to
the
persons
who
had
not
yet
moved.
i
mean,
as
of
the
time
its
adoption.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
we
have
relevancy
if
they
were
be
protected
by
the
68
statute.
i'm
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
there
is
a
matter
of
fact
as
we
would
argue
it,
they
really
not
very
material
differences.
certainly,
if
you
view
the
68
act
along
the
with
the
im
8168,
the
regulation,
the
uniform
relocation
act
of
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i
would
say
you
would
not
because
i
would
say
this
case
is
determined
by
the
68
act.
now,
i
would
like
to
argue
to
the
court
what
i
believe
that’s
the
case.
now,
if
assurances
were
required
by
the
1968
statute
and
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
united
states
is
wrong.
and
they
claim,
it
was
to
required
by
im
8168
because
their
cut-off
date
which
rests
on
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
invalid,
10
petitioner’s
rights
were
violated.
the
violation
of
those
rights
would
give
rise
to
a
remedy
and
the
question
then
would
be,
what
is
that
remedy?
now
this
time
obviously,
the
remedy
in
the
statute
in
the
regulation
would
not
make
sense.
assurances
at
this
point,
now
that
almost
everybody
has
been
moved
out
and
a
plan
that
would
everybody
has
been
moved
out
would
not
be
the
appropriate
thing
to
do.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
court
of
equity
couldn’t
device
what
would
be
the
appropriate
thing
to
do.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
if
the
rights
were
violated,
then
the
respondents
would
have
an
obligation
to
go
and
find
the
people
who
have
been
dislocated.
find
out
whether
they
have
been
located
in
housing
which
met
the
standards
required
by
statute,
and
if
not
relocate
them.
and
the
state
respondents
in
their
brief
seem
to
concede
that
this
would
be
inappropriate
form
of
relief
if
we
can
find
that
there
was
a
substantive
legal
wrong
done
at
the
time.
and
therefore,
the
question
is,
were
the
rights
violated
by
the
1968
statute?
since,
perhaps
everyone
was
on
the
site
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
but
it
would
be
decisive
of
this
case
if
it
were
applicable.
and
we
submit
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
applicability.
and
if
we
are
correct,
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
courts
below
were
in
error.
it
is
--
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
question
that
no
assurances
were
given
as
required
by
the
1968
statute;
that’s
the
government’s
position
as
set
forth
in
their
brief
and
it's
their
position,
no
assurances
were
given
because
no
assurances
were
required.
and
secondly,
the
recent
decision
of
this
court,
the
overton
park
case
comes
into
play
because
the
assurances
that
should
have
been
given,
if
indeed
they
should
been
given,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
they
should
have
been,
would
have
constituted
the
administrative
record
upon
which
the
court
below,
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
made
its
appraisal.
not
any
de
novo
hearing
of
calling
in
witnesses
who've
been
involved
in
the
transactions,
but
a
hearing
on
the
administrative
record.
and
that
indeed
is
also,
i
gather
the
government’s
position
because
in
their
brief,
i
believe
on
page
42
or
46,
they
say
that
those
assurances,
page
46,
would
have
constituted
the
administrative
record
but
there
were
no
such
assurances
because
they
were
not
required.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say,
no,
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
trial
court
should
have
had
an
administrative
record
before
it
and
it
should
have
appraised
that
administrative
record.
it
did
not
have
an
administrative
record
before
because
the
assurances
which
would
have
constituted
that
record
were
not
given,
because
it
was
the
position
of
the
government
under
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
they
were
not
required.
we
submit
that
that
interpretation,
if
the
statute
was
incorrect,
then
we’d
like
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
quite
clearly
that
interpretation
was
incorrect.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
we
do
make
such
a
claim
and
we
could
sustain
that
if
it
were
necessary
to
do
that
upon
a
de
novo
record,
and
indeed,
there’s
a
considerable
argument
in
our
brief
as
to
how
the
facts
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
are
to
the
contrary,
but
those
findings
we
think,
are
first
of
all,
clearly
erroneous
and
this
were
an
ordinary
kind
of
trial
but
clearly
irrelevant
and
improper
because
they
were
not
made
upon
administrative
record
such
as
this
court
is
indicated
would
be
required
in
the
overton
park
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
demonstrate
the
1968
amendments
were
applicable
and
we
find
this
in
just
about
all
the
sources
one
can
find
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
and
the
purpose
of
the
1968
relocation
amendments.
now,
we
must
remember,
it’s
the
government’s
argument
that
the
statute
is
not
applicable
because
it
does
not
apply
to
rights-of-way
which
will
authorized
prior
to
the
adoption
of
a
statute.
and
the
first
thing,
we
must
notice,
this
is
manufactured
out
of
nothing.
one
reads
the
statute
in
vain,
defines
such
a
limitation,
such
a
limitation
appears
nowhere
and
is
not
even
suggested
anywhere
in
the
statute.
if
one
looks
at
the
language
of
the
statute
now,
section
501
which
is
the
declaration
of
policy,
it
says,
congress
hereby
--
this
is
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
congress
hereby
declares
a
prompt
and
equitable
relocation
and
reestablishment
of
persons,
businesses
and
so
forth
is
necessary.
it
speaks
about
relocation,
there's
nowhere
any
cut-off
date
as
to
when
rights
will
authorize
because
as
the
briefs
of
all
parties
indicate,
the
time
between
authorization
of
right-of-way
and
construction
of
relocation
is
sometimes
a
period
of
very
many
years.
if
we
look
at
section
511
(1d)
(3)
of
the
statute
which
defines
a
displaced
person,
we
find
that
displaced
person
defined
as,
any
person
who
meet
moves
from
real
property
on
or
after
the
effect
of
date
of
this
chapter,
as
result
of
the
acquisition
or
reasonable
expectation
of
acquisition
of
such
real
property.
so
again,
that
not
only
makes
no
reference
to
projects
who
were
rights-of-way
or
approved
or
acquired
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
it
refers
to
persons
being
moved
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
now,
the
statute
also
has
relocation
payment
provisions.
it
requires
not
only
relocation
assistance
but
relocation
payment.
the
time
factors
in
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
refer
to
relocation
payment
and
relocation
assistance
without
any
discrimination
or
differentiation
between
the
two
and
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
that
relocation
payments
maybe
made
to
the
petitioners
here
and
indeed
were
made
to
the
petitioners
here.
yet,
there
is
no
reason
and
nothing
anyone
can
find
in
the
statute
to
differentiate
between
them.
now,
we
go
back
to
the
genesis
of
the
statute.
this
statute
came
out
of
a
1967
study
which
was
ordered
by
a
1966
statute
passed
by
congress.
and
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief,
the
relocation
assistance
study
statute
appears,
2
and
3
of
the
appendix
of
the
brief,
and
that
calls
for
a
full
and
complete
study,
an
investigation
for
the
purpose
of
the
determining
what
action
can
and
should
be
taken
to
provide
additional
assistance
for
the
relocation
or
reestablishment
of
persons
and
so
forth
to
be
displaced
by
construction
of
projects
on
a
federal-aid
highway
systems.
again,
it
looks
forward
to
dealing
with
people
who
are
going
to
be
relocated.
and
then,
if
we
look
back
to
the
1962
statute
which
is
the
1968
statute
replaced,
we
find
and
this
is
on
section
133
(e),
which
is
on
page
2
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
a
limitation
such
as
is
not
found
in
the
1968
statute
and
section
e
says,
this
section
shall
apply
only
with
respect
to
projects
approved
under
section
106
of
this
title
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
section.
no
such
provision
is
found
on
the
1968
statute.
now,
the
new
statute,
the
1968
statute
came
out
of
crisis
caused
by
the
need
to
relocate
large
numbers
of
persons
who
were
being
displaced
because
highways
were
being
built
through
their
homes.
now,
the
national
highway
system
which
gave
rise
to
this
problem
was
to
be
41,000
miles
in
length.
at
the
time,
the
1961
statutes
were
adopted;
32,000
miles
had
been
built.
9,000
miles
remained
to
be
built.
of
the
9,000
miles,
remained
to
be
built;
8,500
miles
had
already
had
their
rights-of-way
authorized.
now,
that
would
mean
congress
went
to
all
this
trouble
and
passed
this
enormous
apparatus
and
the
statute
made
all
this
requirements
with
regard
only
to
500
miles,
and
it
just
doesn’t
make
any
sense.
now,
it
would
mean
that
congress
engaged
in
a
few
--
we
would
think
that
the
government
has
fairly
well
described
the
reason
for
the
position
which
was
taken.
in
page
424
of
the
record,
they’re
willing
to
pay
relocation
payments
because
after
all
the
payment
and
monies
are
fairly
simple
and
uncomplicated
and
unmessy
act.
mr.
carpenter,
the
division
right-of-way
officer
testifies
on
page
424
about
what
it
would
mean
to
have
to
actually
provide
the
relocation.
and
he
says,
“certainly,
it
would
have
been
putting
another
here
shirt
on
the
state
to
ask
them
to
give
us
a
formal
submission
on
the
record
of
what
they
are
already
doing.
they
would
have
had
to
stop
work,
put
several
people
on
this
to
formalize
it,
submit
it
to
me,
have
my
people
review
it,
and
give
them
approval
back.
it
would
have
served
no
practical
purpose.”
but
on
the
contrary,
congress
ordered
that
that's
just
what
had
to
be
done.
congress
didn’t
want
anybody
to
wear
a
here
shirt,
but
congress
wanted
that
the
state
and
federal
authorities
concerned
should
actually
attend
to
the
difficult
and
perhaps
unpleasant
but
necessary
job
of
relocation.
now,
the
courts
below
accepted
the
cut-off
date,
that
is
the
cut-off
date
as
to
high
right-of-way
acquisition
which
had
been
approved
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1968
statute,
and
he
accepted
that
as
an
authoritative
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute.
well,
everyone
knows
that
administrative
agencies
make
interpretations
of
statutes
and
those
interpretations
are
entitled
to
considerable
and
often
conclusive
way.
but
that
is
only
so
when
those
interpretations
come
out
of
the
practicalities
of
the
situation,
some
special
experience,
some
involvement
with
the
operation
of
a
statute
and
a
program,
which
would
lend
a
special
authority
to
that
kind
of
interpretation.
so
far
as
the
interpretation
of
the
plain
language
of
a
statute
and
its
legislative
history
and
its
purpose,
courts
and
lawyers
do
that
as
well
as
administrators
and
we
submit
that
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
point
to
the
fact
that
congress
intended
to
protect
people
who
are
going
to
be
relocated
and
not
just
the
minuscule
small
amount
of
people
who
are
going
to
be
on
the
way
of
the
national
highway
system.
now,
if
this
1968
statute
is
applicable
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
need
to
go
on
to
the
1970
regulations,
though
we
argue
that
in
our
brief,
judge
sobeloff
sets
forth
the
reason
why
those
protect
the
rights
of
at
least
those
who
are
on
the
site
as
of
the
time,
the
adoption
of
those
regulations
under
the
doctrine
of
the
fourth
case
or
the
71
statute
which
would
protect
the
rights
of
those
--
that
handful
who
remain
on
the
site
after
the
adoption
of
the
71
statute,
or
the
constitutional
question.
but
indeed,
the
constitutional
question
provides
an
additional
reason
what
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
we
have
argued
is
we
believe
correct.
and
that
is
the
statutory
interpretation
which
we
urge
would
avoid
the
decision
of
the
constitutional
question
and
it
is
a
settled
cannon
of
statutory
construction,
that
is
something
which
courts
strive
to
do.
and
so
for
the
reasons
given,
we
would
submit
that
the
petitioners
who
are
in
the
way
of
the
highway
1968
are
entitled
to
protection
of
the
1968
statute,
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
instructional
memorandum.
if
the
case
is
not
moot,
it
involves
these
petitioners
as
well
as
many
others
situated
throughout
the
country
and
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
what
form
of
relief
shall
be
granted,
and
that
the
court
of
equity
can
figure
that
out.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fact
is
the
statute
was
not
complied
with.
the
assurances
that
are
required
by
a
statute
were
not
given,
a
plan
that
was
required
according
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
not
filed.
i
might
add,
there
was
indeed
a
plan
filed,
prepared
for
this
litigation,
very
much
like
the
litigation
affidavits
in
overton
park
and
that
was
dismissed
by
the
federal
authorities
as
half
a
plan
and
really
not
adequate.
the
reason
that
the
congress
enacted
a
statute
and
the
department
adopted
regulations
was
because
precisely
the
kind
of
practices
that
are
going
on
here,
that
is
informal
relocation
taking
the
word
of
the
various
departments
acting
in
a
non-structured,
non-reviewable
way,
not
on
any
record
which
a
court
can
review
was
deemed
adequate
and
that
is
why,
the
statute
was
adopted
and
the
regulations
implementing
were
adopted.
that
is
what
happened
here.
the
court
made
a
de
novo
review
on
the
basis
of
ad
hoc,
post
hoc
rationalizations,
testimony
put
on
by
witnesses,
came
to
the
court
after
the
event
not
on
administrative
record
which
is
exactly
what
this
statute
was
designed
to
provide.
and
we
submit
there's
been
no
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
relief
as
to
the
326
persons
who
originally
were
on
the
side
of
the
triangle
would
be
something
in
the
general
nature
of
what
the
state
respondents
and
we
agree
would
be
appropriate.
i
mean,
they
agree
that
if
they
lose
the
case,
this
would
be
appropriate
and
that
is
that
the
state
authorities
ought
to
find
where
these
people
had
been
relocated
to.
and
in
fact,
they
say
they
are
even
somewhat
in
the
process
of
doing
that
right
now
and
find
out
whether
or
not
the
housing
in
which
they
now
live
meets
the
statutory
standards.
if
it
does
not
meet
the
statutory
standards
then
they
ought
to
take
such
steps
as
unnecessary
to
relocate
these
people
in
statutory
housing.
now,
that’s
not
the
relief
provided
for
in
the
statute
but
that
is
an
adaptation
of
it
which
is
appropriate
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
of
course,
there
would
be
a
rule
of
law
coming
out
of
this
case
which
would
protect
the
other
persons
in
the
way
of
the
highway.
i
might
say
there’s
some
difference
in
opinion
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
would
apply
to
all
326
people
who
were
in
the
trial.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
there
are
some
of
them
may
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
they
are
not
members
of
this
class
and
not
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that’s
right.
that’s
right
and
there
are
326.
now,
there
is
some
difference
between
us
on
the
division
of
the
8,500
and
500
out
of
the
9,000
miles.
we
have
cited
in
our
on
page
29,
the
senate
committee
report,
and
i
believe
or
at
least,
i
hope
you
will
find
to
that
report
that
approximately
8,500
miles
had
already
been
authorized.
and
therefore,
if
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
prevails,
only
persons
in
the
remaining
500
miles
would
be
covered,
but
even
those
of
500
miles
through
cities
involves
a
very
considerable
number
of
people.
