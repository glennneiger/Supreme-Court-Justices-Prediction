how
many
have
not
yet
been
relocated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
handful
of
being
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
in
that
time
when
the
case
got
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
300.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
that
under
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
anyway,
that
expressly
saves
all
rights
under
the
old
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
for
the
new
statute
has
no
relevancy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
half
dozen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
i
mean
the
--
i
suppose,
there
are
some
differences
between
the
uniform
act
and
the
68
act,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
really
getting
at
mr.
greenberg,
we
don’t
have
to
be
concern
on
deciding
this
case
with
the
provisions
of
the
uniform
act
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
reynolds,
are
there
other
projects
as
to
which
the
interpretation
of
the
section
mentioned
becomes
important?
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
other
projects
of
people
not
yet
relocated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
idea
how
many
people
happened
to
beinvolved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
how
about
a
few
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
the
one
fact
that
we
have
only
seven
involved
on
this
particular
project.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
how
many
people
whose
relocation
maybe
determined
on
our
resolution
of
the
interpretation
of
what
you
call
it,
502
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
more
people
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whose
relocation
and
turns
on
the
answer
to
this
question,
than
just
a
seven
we
have
involved
here,
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
two
hearings
or
haven’t
gone
so
far
that
the
project
would
not
be
covered
by
the
'68
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wouldn’t
do
us
any
good
then,
would
it,
to
say,
well,
what's
the
use
in
our
deciding
this
question
here,
only
seven
or
five
or
six,
seven
people
are
involved
because
the
issue
only
will
be
back
again
in
some
other
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
might
just
well
go
ahead
and
decide
it,
can
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
they
will
be
submitted
what?
under
the
regulations
or
under
the
new
statute
or
under
the
old
statute,
where
--
