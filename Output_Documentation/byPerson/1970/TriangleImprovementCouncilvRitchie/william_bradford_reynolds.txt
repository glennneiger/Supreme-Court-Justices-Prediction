mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
respondents
do
not
contend
that
the
1968
amendments
to
the
federal-aid
highway
act
are
wholly
inapplicable
to
highway
projects
already
underway
on
the
date
of
enactment.
the
relocation
payment
provisions
are
clearly
applicable
to
such
projects.
the
provision
requiring
a
state
to
provide
a
relocation
program
is
clearly
applicable
to
such
projects,
and
the
statutory
requirement
that
all
housing
meet
the
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
housing
standard
as
defined
by
the
secretary
is
clearly
applicable
to
such
projects.
what
in
our
view
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
courts
below
is
not
applicable
to
projects
which
by
august
23,
1968
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
two
hearing
question
is
the
single
statutory
provision
of
section
502
requiring
that
state
submit
to
the
secretary,
certain
formal
assurances
before
they
can
obtain
his
approval
to
proceed
with
that
space
of
the
project
“which
will
cause
the
displacement
of
any
person”,
family
or
business.
and
insofar
as
a
statute
is
here
involved,
it
is
the
applicability
of
that
provision
and
that
provision
alone,
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
let
me
turn
briefly
if
i
may
to
the
facts
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
except
with
respect
to
our
argument
as
to
mootness,
i
would.
the
substantive
provisions
themselves
i
would
say,
that
is
correct.
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
factor
which
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
should
decline
to
decide
these
issues.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
believe
there
are
other
projects
of
the
9,000
miles
of
interstate
highway
that
were
fully
--
not
fully
constructed
or
were
under
construction
on
date
of
enactment.
the
8,500
miles
which
counsel
for
petitioners
refer
to,
had
not
commenced
right-of-way
acquisition
or
relocation
as
of
that
date.
so
as
to
that
8,500
miles,
the
provisions
of
section
502
calling
for
formal
assurances
and
of
the
regulation
as
to
a
former
relocation
would
be
applicable.
as
to
8,500
of
the
9,000
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
have
any
information
as
to
how
much
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
assume
that
it
would
be
quite
a
few
on
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
oh,
i'm
sure.
i
thought
you
meant
how
many
people
in
the
8,500
miles.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
section
502.
it
would
be
the
number
of
people,
i
assume
in
that
500
miles
that
are
not
that
at
time
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
on
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
might
turn
on
--
i
don’t
know
as
to
that
again,
as
to
that
number
how
many
--
what
status
is
of
the
projects
in
that
500
miles.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
which
not
gone
so
far
as
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
think
that
is
correct.
it
is
very
hard
that
to
get
a
bearing
on
each
project
in
the
500
--
but
we
know
that
there
are
500
miles
which
at
the
time,
the
1968
statute
was
passed,
had
not
commenced,
i
mean
had
commenced
the
right-of-way
acquisition
and
relocation
programs
but
had
not
completed
them.
and
the
argument
i
would
believe,
--
i
believe
the
argument
as
to
those
projects
would
be
the
same
as
our
argument
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it,
it,
wait
your
honor,
it
might
be
back
in
some
other
case
and
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
don’t
believe
that
it
is
any
longer
an
issue
in
this
case.
and
i
also
don’t
know
whether
on
the
same
basis
as
this
case,
where
this
is
any
need
to
decide
that
issue
for
the
other
--
the
basis
of
our
argument
in
this
case.
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
none
at
all.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
in
projects
in
a
status
similar
to
this
one,
there
would
be
no
requirement
for
a
formal
plan.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
as
of
today,
in
enactment,
there
were
projects
within
8,500
of
the
9,000
miles
that
were
less
far
along.
it's
only
projects
within
the
500
miles
which
that
were
within
the
same
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct.
all
plans
in
that
8,500
miles
will
be
submitted.
it’s
the
additional
500
miles,
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
are
in
a
similar
status
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
the
68
act,
they
would
be
required
to
be
submitted
for
formal
assurance
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
the
regulations
would
by
the
same
slogan
require
the
former
relocation
plan.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
that
that
statute
would
be
involved
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
in
that
respect.
oh,
anybody
have
rights
under
this
68
statute
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
do
think
on
that
uniform
relocation
act,
the
language
in
the
provision
section
210
which
would
be
the
similar
provision
to
the
one
we’re
dealing
with
here
is
dissimilar
and
an
interpretation
of
this
statute
would
not
be
controlling
on
the
new
statute.
and
that
is
another
reason
that
we
would
submit
that
this
court
could
decline
to
reach
the
issue.
if
i
may
just
add
a
few
facts.
we
are
concerned
here
with
two
state
highway
projects
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
they
had
the
public
hearing
required
by
statute
in
connection
with
the
route
in
this
your
honor
and
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
was
the
hearing
required
in
section
128
of
the
act.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
a
hearing
for
the
--
it
was
a
hearing
held
for
the
people
who
lived
in
the
community
to
come
in
and
discuss
the
routing
with
the
federal
and
state
officials.
and
that
was
discussed
and
there's
no
challenge
in
this
case
at
this
point
to
the
routing
decision.
there
was
a
hearing
held
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
was
no
plan
here.
this
was
a
hearing
prior
to
approval
by
the
secretary
of
the
route
on
this
project.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
was
held
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor
it’s
in
the
record
--
the
hearing
is
in
the
record.
now
as
i
said,
we’re
concerned
here
with
two
highway
projects.
over
two-thirds
of
each
project
is
outside
the
so-called
triangle
area.
but
each
penetrates
that
area,
project
a
from
the
north
and
project
b
from
the
southeast
and
they
meet
within
it.
now,
the
portion
within
this
so-called
triangle
area
covers
several
city
blocks.
of
the
284
persons,
living
there
at
the
time
the
suit
was
commenced,
approximately
two-thirds
were
negro
and
the
rest
were
white.
the
average
monthly
income
was
a
$170.00
and
a
substantial
portion
of
the
housing
was
substandard.
after
federal
authorities
authorized
the
state
to
require
all
the
right-of-way
within
the
two-project
carters.
the
state
road
commission
set
up
a
relocation
office
for
the
benefit
of
those
to
be
relocated
in
the
two-project
carters.
it
was
located
within
this
so-called
triangle
area.
it
was
staffed
with
9
to
10
people
full
time.
it
conducted
a
survey
of
those
living
within
the
two-project
carters
to
determine
their
family
needs,
their
family
size,
where
they
worked,
where
they
went
to
church
and
what
their
preference
was
with
respect
to
new
relocation
housing,
what
type
of
housing
they
desire.
they
compiled
a
list
of
available
housing
within
the
charleston
area,
posted
it
in
the
relocation
office,
and
kept
it
updated
on
a
daily
basis.
and
it
provided
special
services
to
those
who
would
be
displaced.
for
example,
it
would
drive
the
elderly
to
available
rentals
that
they
wish
to
inspect.
it
would
help
those
who
had
located
relocation
housing
to
move
and
to
obtain
furniture.
it
would
help
make
arrangements
for
initial
rent
deposits,
where
necessary
and
it
would
help
obtain
priority
certificates
for
public
housing.
now
on
enactment
of
the
1968
amendments
to
the
federal-aid
highway
act,
the
state
road
commission
assigned
three
persons
full
time
to
doing
nothing
but
inspect
available
rental
in
the
charleston
area
to
ensure
that
they
complied
with
the
new
decency
and
sanitary
housing
standard.
by
august
23,
1968,
the
state
had
successfully
relocated
a
substantial
number
of
the
original
2,184
persons
who
were
originally
to
be
displaced
from
the
two-highway
projects.
over
one-half
or
1,314
had
been
relocated
at
the
time
of
trial
and
the
state
had
acquired
over
60%
of
the
land
and
in
each
of
the
two
carters.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
relocations
of
those
persons
within
this
so-called
triangle
area
had
not
progress
that
far.
42
of
the
326
originally
there
had
been
relocated.
similarly,
relocations
within
other
isolated
areas
on
these
two
projects
had
not
progressed
that
far.
but
the
entire
statutory
scheme
we
are
dealing
with
here
speaks
in
terms
of
projects.
it
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
segments
of
projects
or
city
blocks
within
projects
or
the
six
ward
or
any
other
said
subdivisions
that
maybe
created
for
the
purposes
of
bringing
a
lawsuit.
and
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
petitioner’s
argument
turns
in
large
part
on
their
contention
that
charleston
was
a
racially
closed
housing
market.
i’d
like
to
address
just
a
few
comments
to
that
argument.
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
the
proposition
is
two
studies.
one
by
petitioner’s
principle
witness
and
one,
an
early
draft
of
a
study
prepared
for
the
charleston-irvine
renewal
program
which
is
just
now
getting
under
way.
both
studies
draw
primarily
on
1960
census
data
and
neither
study
talks
about
the
housing
situation
in
charleston
after
1966.
now,
we
do
not
understand
the
issue
before
this
court
to
be
whether
at
one
time
discrimination
in
housing
did
exist
in
the
charleston
area
which
resulted
in
earlier
geographical
divisions
in
the
city
along
racial
lines.
the
question
is
whether
at
the
time
this
action
was
commenced
in
december
1968
and
thereafter,
charleston
had
a
racially
closed
housing
market.
the
court
below,
both
courts
found
that
it
did
not
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
record
to
contradict
that
finding.
in
november
of
1967,
the
city
of
charleston
passed
an
open
housing
ordinance.
congress
passed
a
similar
law
in
april
of
1968.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
even
suggesting
that
the
people
in
charleston
are
not
complying
with
those
statutory
provisions,
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
city
and
state
officials
were
having
difficulty
with
there
enforcement
or
that
they
were
turning
their
backs
and
not
enforcing
the
provisions.
in
the
public
housing
sector,
it
is
undisputed
that
there
are
three
public
housing
projects,
all
within
the
charleston
city
limits.
and
all
of
them
rent
one,
two,
three,
and
four
bedroom
units
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
this
housing
meets
the
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
housing
standard
in
a
substantially
better
than
a
housing
which
existed
within
the
so-called
triangle
area.
it
is
available
at
20%
of
a
family’s
average
net
income
per
month
and
it
is
available
to
all
families
earning
less
than
$5,000.00
per
year,
which
would
include
virtually
all
of
those
within
this
so-called
triangle
area.
in
the
private
housing
sector,
the
evidence
shows
that
approximately
80
dwelling
units
were
available
for
rent
in
charleston
--
in
the
charleston
area
on
any
given
day.
in
determining
the
availability
of
private
housing,
the
state
road
commission
eliminated
from
consideration,
the
two,
three,
and
four
family
dwelling
units
in
which
the
owner
resided.
therefore,
all
80
were
under
the
open
housing
ordinance
and
were
rented
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
the
average
rental
was
$90.00
per
month
which
with
the
statutory
rental
supplements
could
be
afforded
by
all
those
within
this
triangle
area.
and
while
i
am
discussing
private
housing,
i'd
like
to
allude
just
briefly
to
petitioner’s
telephone
survey
which
they
discuss
in
their
briefs
and
which
is
plaintiff’s
exhibit
25,
they
contend
that
this
survey
shows
that
out
of
50
private
dwellings,
telephone,
only
eight
would
rent
to
black
families.
that
survey
does
not
show
that
42
of
the
dwelling
units
would
not
rent
the
black
families.
28
of
the
homes
within
that
survey
would
not
even
asked
the
question
because
they
didn’t
have
any
vacancies
when
they
were
called.
in
fact,
only
four
owners
gave
any
indication
that
they
would
not
rent
to
negroes.
one
of
those
owners
said
that
she
would
not
rent
to
a
negro
male
but
she
would
rent
to
a
negro
female.
and
another
one
said
that
she
cannot
answer
the
question
until
she
telephone
her
until
she
talk
it
over
with
her
husband
and
she
would
never
called
back.
with
respect
to
the
other
two,
there's
no
indication
on
this
record
whether
they
were
within
the
exclusion
of
the
charleston
open
housing
ordinance.
in
short,
there
is
simply
no
evidence
to
support
the
assertion
that
the
charleston
housing
market
was
in
december
1968
a
racially
closed
to
the
market.
the
courts
below
specifically
so
found,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
of
state
action
which
is
deprive
these
petitioners
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
no
one
is
being
forced
out
into
the
streets.
in
fact,
the
state
has
moved
very
deliberately
and
carefully
in
relocating
the
people
within
this
so-called
triangle
area
and
it
is
taken
over
three
years
to
accomplish
that
task.
on
the
statutory
interpretation
question,
let
me
just
make
three
points.
first,
there
are
two
projects
here
under
discussion
and
i
think,
it
is
agreed,
all
agreed,
were
well
into
their
relocation
programs
by
august
23,
1968.
approximately
913
persons
had
been
relocated
from
project
a
and
there
remained
in
that
carter
380
persons.
approximately
409
persons
had
been
relocated
from
project
b
and
there
remained
approximately
401
persons
--
sorry,
that’s
reversed.
401
had
been
relocated
and
there
remained
409.
the
language
of
both
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
there
under
call
for
formal
assurances
and
formal
relocation
planning
prior
to
any
such
displacement.
the
statute
which
is
section
502,
speaks
in
term
of
the
secretary’s
approval
“which
will
cause
the
displacement
of
any
person.”
but
we
cannot
agree
with
petitioner’s
contention
that
this
language
contemplates
a
secretary’s
approval
to
proceed
with
construction.
the
april
10,
1970,
circular
memorandum
which
they
rely
on
so
heavily
makes
it
very
clear,
the
construction
approval,
the
approval
to
proceed
with
construction
cannot
be
given
until
everybody
has
been
displaced
and
relocated,
who
needs
to
be
displaced
and
relocated,
that
there
can
be
no
approval
of
construction
until
that
is
completed.
second,
with
respect
to
the
statutory
interpretation
question,
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a
formal
relocation
plan
in
this
case.
the
state
road
commission
was
providing
a
relocation
assistance
program
which
complied
in
all
respects
with
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
1968
statutes.
and
this
was
the
primary
concern
of
congress.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
who
approved?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
was
no
relocation
plan
submitted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
was
this
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
was
the
state
road
commission
that
did
provide
the
relocation
program.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
would
--
if
i
may
just
now
get
to
that
in
just
one
second
that
--
i
just
want
to
wind
up
my
point
here
that
there
was
compliance
with
substantive
provisions
and
that
there
was
a
relocation
program.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
it
will
only
take
two
seconds
the
only
additional
point
is
that
the
formal
assurances
and
the
formal
relocation
plan
in
a
regulations
were
a
procedure
which
congress
deemed
appropriate
to
ensure
that
the
states
complied
with
the
substantive
requirement
that
a
relocation
assistance
program
was
afforded
by
the
states.
that
was
the
intent.
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
have
the
program
provided.
now,
here
the
procedure
was
neither
required
by
the
statute
nor
essential
to
the
implementation
of
an
adequate
relocation
assistance
program.
now
justice
marshall
on
your
question,
the
federal
authorities
here
reviewed
the
state
relocation
assistance
program.
they
reviewed
it
specifically
with
respect
to
the
two
projects
here
in
question.
over
a
125
of
the
relocations
had
found
that
they
were
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
is
what
i'm
explaining.
they
had
a
day-to-day
audit
of
federal
authorities
in
west
virginia.
the
division
engineer
had
a
day-to-day
audit
of
the
state
road
commission’s
operations.
it
reviewed
over
a
125
of
these
specific
relocations
that
are
involved
in
these
two
project
areas
and
found
them
to
be
satisfactory
in
all
respects.
and
it
continually
reviewed
the
state
operations
throughout
the
state
as
well
as
on
these
two
projects.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
there
was
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
was
no
plan
as
such,
that’s
correct.
there
was
a
study
of
the
relocation
of
the
available
housing
and
there
was
--
it’s
termed
in
the
record,
a
half
of
relocation
plans
submitted
in
1966.
but
there
was
no
written
plan
as
such.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
they
“reviewed”
this.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
in
the
record
in
a
number
of
pages
most
of
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
appendix
references,
where
the
federal
authorities
went
in
and
scrutinized,
what
was
going
on
in
these
two
projects?
what
the
state
was
doing
to
relocate
the
people
and
how
they
were
providing
assistance?
and
there
is
testimony,
an
abundance
of
testimony
that
they
were
in
there
looking
at
this
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
and
that
your
honor
is
why
i
think
this
case
is
not
within
the
citizens
to
preserve
the
overton
park
decision.
this
was
not
a
review
of
a
secretary’s
“approval”
under
section
502
because
he
did
not
give
that
approval.
what
it
was
a
review
of
agency
action
under
the
statute
based
on
the
experience
of
the
federal
and
state
officials.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
do
not
because
as
we
argue
the
case,
the
secretary
was
not
required
in
this
case
to
give
the
approval.
what
was
required
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
provide
an
adequate
relocation
program,
and
that
is
what
was
being
reviewed
by
federal
authorities
and
they
determined
that
this
program
was
adequate
and
that
we
--
this
was
not
a
review
of
the
administrative
record
and
i
believe
in
overton
park,
this
case
stated
that
where
there
is
no
such
administrative
record,
it
is
entirely
appropriate
to
call
the
officials
involved
in
the
action
and
have
them
testify
and
make
a
judicial
determination
on
the
basis
of
that
testimony.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
the
federal
funds
were
approved.
there
was
full
payment
of
federal
funds
and
the
reason
that
that
was
required
in
this
case
was
504
(b),
section
504
(b).
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
did
not
give
an
approval
under
502.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
correct
but
he
did.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
did
approve
the
fact
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
504.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor
and
that
is
one
of
provisions
that
we
concede
is
applicable
to
this
case,
the
only
one
not
as
502.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
respondents
do
not
contend
that
the
1968
amendments
to
the
federal-aid
highway
act
are
wholly
inapplicable
to
highway
projects
already
underway
on
the
date
of
enactment.
the
relocation
payment
provisions
are
clearly
applicable
to
such
projects.
the
provision
requiring
a
state
to
provide
a
relocation
program
is
clearly
applicable
to
such
projects,
and
the
statutory
requirement
that
all
housing
meet
the
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
housing
standard
as
defined
by
the
secretary
is
clearly
applicable
to
such
projects.
what
in
our
view
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
courts
below
is
not
applicable
to
projects
which
by
august
23,
1968
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
two
hearing
question
is
the
single
statutory
provision
of
section
502
requiring
that
state
submit
to
the
secretary,
certain
formal
assurances
before
they
can
obtain
his
approval
to
proceed
with
that
space
of
the
project
“which
will
cause
the
displacement
of
any
person”,
family
or
business.
and
insofar
as
a
statute
is
here
involved,
it
is
the
applicability
of
that
provision
and
that
provision
alone,
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
let
me
turn
briefly
if
i
may
to
the
facts
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
except
with
respect
to
our
argument
as
to
mootness,
i
would.
the
substantive
provisions
themselves
i
would
say,
that
is
correct.
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
factor
which
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
should
decline
to
decide
these
issues.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
i
believe
there
are
other
projects
of
the
9,000
miles
of
interstate
highway
that
were
fully
--
not
fully
constructed
or
were
under
construction
on
date
of
enactment.
the
8,500
miles
which
counsel
for
petitioners
refer
to,
had
not
commenced
right-of-way
acquisition
or
relocation
as
of
that
date.
so
as
to
that
8,500
miles,
the
provisions
of
section
502
calling
for
formal
assurances
and
of
the
regulation
as
to
a
former
relocation
would
be
applicable.
as
to
8,500
of
the
9,000
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
have
any
information
as
to
how
much
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
assume
that
it
would
be
quite
a
few
on
the
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
oh,
i'm
sure.
i
thought
you
meant
how
many
people
in
the
8,500
miles.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
section
502.
it
would
be
the
number
of
people,
i
assume
in
that
500
miles
that
are
not
that
at
time
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
on
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
might
turn
on
--
i
don’t
know
as
to
that
again,
as
to
that
number
how
many
--
what
status
is
of
the
projects
in
that
500
miles.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
which
not
gone
so
far
as
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
think
that
is
correct.
it
is
very
hard
that
to
get
a
bearing
on
each
project
in
the
500
--
but
we
know
that
there
are
500
miles
which
at
the
time,
the
1968
statute
was
passed,
had
not
commenced,
i
mean
had
commenced
the
right-of-way
acquisition
and
relocation
programs
but
had
not
completed
them.
and
the
argument
i
would
believe,
--
i
believe
the
argument
as
to
those
projects
would
be
the
same
as
our
argument
here.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it,
it,
wait
your
honor,
it
might
be
back
in
some
other
case
and
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
don’t
believe
that
it
is
any
longer
an
issue
in
this
case.
and
i
also
don’t
know
whether
on
the
same
basis
as
this
case,
where
this
is
any
need
to
decide
that
issue
for
the
other
--
the
basis
of
our
argument
in
this
case.
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
none
at
all.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
in
projects
in
a
status
similar
to
this
one,
there
would
be
no
requirement
for
a
formal
plan.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
as
of
today,
in
enactment,
there
were
projects
within
8,500
of
the
9,000
miles
that
were
less
far
along.
it's
only
projects
within
the
500
miles
which
that
were
within
the
same
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
correct.
all
plans
in
that
8,500
miles
will
be
submitted.
it’s
the
additional
500
miles,
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
are
in
a
similar
status
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
under
the
68
act,
they
would
be
required
to
be
submitted
for
formal
assurance
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
the
regulations
would
by
the
same
slogan
require
the
former
relocation
plan.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
don’t
believe
that
that
statute
would
be
involved
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that’s
correct
in
that
respect.
oh,
anybody
have
rights
under
this
68
statute
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
do
think
on
that
uniform
relocation
act,
the
language
in
the
provision
section
210
which
would
be
the
similar
provision
to
the
one
we’re
dealing
with
here
is
dissimilar
and
an
interpretation
of
this
statute
would
not
be
controlling
on
the
new
statute.
and
that
is
another
reason
that
we
would
submit
that
this
court
could
decline
to
reach
the
issue.
if
i
may
just
add
a
few
facts.
we
are
concerned
here
with
two
state
highway
projects
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
they
had
the
public
hearing
required
by
statute
in
connection
with
the
route
in
this
your
honor
and
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
was
the
hearing
required
in
section
128
of
the
act.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
was
a
hearing
for
the
--
it
was
a
hearing
held
for
the
people
who
lived
in
the
community
to
come
in
and
discuss
the
routing
with
the
federal
and
state
officials.
and
that
was
discussed
and
there's
no
challenge
in
this
case
at
this
point
to
the
routing
decision.
there
was
a
hearing
held
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
was
no
plan
here.
this
was
a
hearing
prior
to
approval
by
the
secretary
of
the
route
on
this
project.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
was
held
that
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor
it’s
in
the
record
--
the
hearing
is
in
the
record.
now
as
i
said,
we’re
concerned
here
with
two
highway
projects.
over
two-thirds
of
each
project
is
outside
the
so-called
triangle
area.
but
each
penetrates
that
area,
project
a
from
the
north
and
project
b
from
the
southeast
and
they
meet
within
it.
now,
the
portion
within
this
so-called
triangle
area
covers
several
city
blocks.
of
the
284
persons,
living
there
at
the
time
the
suit
was
commenced,
approximately
two-thirds
were
negro
and
the
rest
were
white.
the
average
monthly
income
was
a
$170.00
and
a
substantial
portion
of
the
housing
was
substandard.
after
federal
authorities
authorized
the
state
to
require
all
the
right-of-way
within
the
two-project
carters.
the
state
road
commission
set
up
a
relocation
office
for
the
benefit
of
those
to
be
relocated
in
the
two-project
carters.
it
was
located
within
this
so-called
triangle
area.
it
was
staffed
with
9
to
10
people
full
time.
it
conducted
a
survey
of
those
living
within
the
two-project
carters
to
determine
their
family
needs,
their
family
size,
where
they
worked,
where
they
went
to
church
and
what
their
preference
was
with
respect
to
new
relocation
housing,
what
type
of
housing
they
desire.
they
compiled
a
list
of
available
housing
within
the
charleston
area,
posted
it
in
the
relocation
office,
and
kept
it
updated
on
a
daily
basis.
and
it
provided
special
services
to
those
who
would
be
displaced.
for
example,
it
would
drive
the
elderly
to
available
rentals
that
they
wish
to
inspect.
it
would
help
those
who
had
located
relocation
housing
to
move
and
to
obtain
furniture.
it
would
help
make
arrangements
for
initial
rent
deposits,
where
necessary
and
it
would
help
obtain
priority
certificates
for
public
housing.
now
on
enactment
of
the
1968
amendments
to
the
federal-aid
highway
act,
the
state
road
commission
assigned
three
persons
full
time
to
doing
nothing
but
inspect
available
rental
in
the
charleston
area
to
ensure
that
they
complied
with
the
new
decency
and
sanitary
housing
standard.
by
august
23,
1968,
the
state
had
successfully
relocated
a
substantial
number
of
the
original
2,184
persons
who
were
originally
to
be
displaced
from
the
two-highway
projects.
over
one-half
or
1,314
had
been
relocated
at
the
time
of
trial
and
the
state
had
acquired
over
60%
of
the
land
and
in
each
of
the
two
carters.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
relocations
of
those
persons
within
this
so-called
triangle
area
had
not
progress
that
far.
42
of
the
326
originally
there
had
been
relocated.
similarly,
relocations
within
other
isolated
areas
on
these
two
projects
had
not
progressed
that
far.
but
the
entire
statutory
scheme
we
are
dealing
with
here
speaks
in
terms
of
projects.
it
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
segments
of
projects
or
city
blocks
within
projects
or
the
six
ward
or
any
other
said
subdivisions
that
maybe
created
for
the
purposes
of
bringing
a
lawsuit.
and
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
petitioner’s
argument
turns
in
large
part
on
their
contention
that
charleston
was
a
racially
closed
housing
market.
i’d
like
to
address
just
a
few
comments
to
that
argument.
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
the
proposition
is
two
studies.
one
by
petitioner’s
principle
witness
and
one,
an
early
draft
of
a
study
prepared
for
the
charleston-irvine
renewal
program
which
is
just
now
getting
under
way.
both
studies
draw
primarily
on
1960
census
data
and
neither
study
talks
about
the
housing
situation
in
charleston
after
1966.
now,
we
do
not
understand
the
issue
before
this
court
to
be
whether
at
one
time
discrimination
in
housing
did
exist
in
the
charleston
area
which
resulted
in
earlier
geographical
divisions
in
the
city
along
racial
lines.
the
question
is
whether
at
the
time
this
action
was
commenced
in
december
1968
and
thereafter,
charleston
had
a
racially
closed
housing
market.
the
court
below,
both
courts
found
that
it
did
not
and
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
record
to
contradict
that
finding.
in
november
of
1967,
the
city
of
charleston
passed
an
open
housing
ordinance.
congress
passed
a
similar
law
in
april
of
1968.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
even
suggesting
that
the
people
in
charleston
are
not
complying
with
those
statutory
provisions,
nor
is
there
any
indication
that
city
and
state
officials
were
having
difficulty
with
there
enforcement
or
that
they
were
turning
their
backs
and
not
enforcing
the
provisions.
in
the
public
housing
sector,
it
is
undisputed
that
there
are
three
public
housing
projects,
all
within
the
charleston
city
limits.
and
all
of
them
rent
one,
two,
three,
and
four
bedroom
units
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
this
housing
meets
the
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
housing
standard
in
a
substantially
better
than
a
housing
which
existed
within
the
so-called
triangle
area.
it
is
available
at
20%
of
a
family’s
average
net
income
per
month
and
it
is
available
to
all
families
earning
less
than
$5,000.00
per
year,
which
would
include
virtually
all
of
those
within
this
so-called
triangle
area.
in
the
private
housing
sector,
the
evidence
shows
that
approximately
80
dwelling
units
were
available
for
rent
in
charleston
--
in
the
charleston
area
on
any
given
day.
in
determining
the
availability
of
private
housing,
the
state
road
commission
eliminated
from
consideration,
the
two,
three,
and
four
family
dwelling
units
in
which
the
owner
resided.
therefore,
all
80
were
under
the
open
housing
ordinance
and
were
rented
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
the
average
rental
was
$90.00
per
month
which
with
the
statutory
rental
supplements
could
be
afforded
by
all
those
within
this
triangle
area.
and
while
i
am
discussing
private
housing,
i'd
like
to
allude
just
briefly
to
petitioner’s
telephone
survey
which
they
discuss
in
their
briefs
and
which
is
plaintiff’s
exhibit
25,
they
contend
that
this
survey
shows
that
out
of
50
private
dwellings,
telephone,
only
eight
would
rent
to
black
families.
that
survey
does
not
show
that
42
of
the
dwelling
units
would
not
rent
the
black
families.
28
of
the
homes
within
that
survey
would
not
even
asked
the
question
because
they
didn’t
have
any
vacancies
when
they
were
called.
in
fact,
only
four
owners
gave
any
indication
that
they
would
not
rent
to
negroes.
one
of
those
owners
said
that
she
would
not
rent
to
a
negro
male
but
she
would
rent
to
a
negro
female.
and
another
one
said
that
she
cannot
answer
the
question
until
she
telephone
her
until
she
talk
it
over
with
her
husband
and
she
would
never
called
back.
with
respect
to
the
other
two,
there's
no
indication
on
this
record
whether
they
were
within
the
exclusion
of
the
charleston
open
housing
ordinance.
in
short,
there
is
simply
no
evidence
to
support
the
assertion
that
the
charleston
housing
market
was
in
december
1968
a
racially
closed
to
the
market.
the
courts
below
specifically
so
found,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
of
state
action
which
is
deprive
these
petitioners
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
no
one
is
being
forced
out
into
the
streets.
in
fact,
the
state
has
moved
very
deliberately
and
carefully
in
relocating
the
people
within
this
so-called
triangle
area
and
it
is
taken
over
three
years
to
accomplish
that
task.
on
the
statutory
interpretation
question,
let
me
just
make
three
points.
first,
there
are
two
projects
here
under
discussion
and
i
think,
it
is
agreed,
all
agreed,
were
well
into
their
relocation
programs
by
august
23,
1968.
approximately
913
persons
had
been
relocated
from
project
a
and
there
remained
in
that
carter
380
persons.
approximately
409
persons
had
been
relocated
from
project
b
and
there
remained
approximately
401
persons
--
sorry,
that’s
reversed.
401
had
been
relocated
and
there
remained
409.
the
language
of
both
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
there
under
call
for
formal
assurances
and
formal
relocation
planning
prior
to
any
such
displacement.
the
statute
which
is
section
502,
speaks
in
term
of
the
secretary’s
approval
“which
will
cause
the
displacement
of
any
person.”
but
we
cannot
agree
with
petitioner’s
contention
that
this
language
contemplates
a
secretary’s
approval
to
proceed
with
construction.
the
april
10,
1970,
circular
memorandum
which
they
rely
on
so
heavily
makes
it
very
clear,
the
construction
approval,
the
approval
to
proceed
with
construction
cannot
be
given
until
everybody
has
been
displaced
and
relocated,
who
needs
to
be
displaced
and
relocated,
that
there
can
be
no
approval
of
construction
until
that
is
completed.
second,
with
respect
to
the
statutory
interpretation
question,
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a
formal
relocation
plan
in
this
case.
the
state
road
commission
was
providing
a
relocation
assistance
program
which
complied
in
all
respects
with
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
1968
statutes.
and
this
was
the
primary
concern
of
congress.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
who
approved?
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
was
no
relocation
plan
submitted.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
was
this
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
was
the
state
road
commission
that
did
provide
the
relocation
program.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
would
--
if
i
may
just
now
get
to
that
in
just
one
second
that
--
i
just
want
to
wind
up
my
point
here
that
there
was
compliance
with
substantive
provisions
and
that
there
was
a
relocation
program.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
it
will
only
take
two
seconds
the
only
additional
point
is
that
the
formal
assurances
and
the
formal
relocation
plan
in
a
regulations
were
a
procedure
which
congress
deemed
appropriate
to
ensure
that
the
states
complied
with
the
substantive
requirement
that
a
relocation
assistance
program
was
afforded
by
the
states.
that
was
the
intent.
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
have
the
program
provided.
now,
here
the
procedure
was
neither
required
by
the
statute
nor
essential
to
the
implementation
of
an
adequate
relocation
assistance
program.
now
justice
marshall
on
your
question,
the
federal
authorities
here
reviewed
the
state
relocation
assistance
program.
they
reviewed
it
specifically
with
respect
to
the
two
projects
here
in
question.
over
a
125
of
the
relocations
had
found
that
they
were
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
that
is
what
i'm
explaining.
they
had
a
day-to-day
audit
of
federal
authorities
in
west
virginia.
the
division
engineer
had
a
day-to-day
audit
of
the
state
road
commission’s
operations.
it
reviewed
over
a
125
of
these
specific
relocations
that
are
involved
in
these
two
project
areas
and
found
them
to
be
satisfactory
in
all
respects.
and
it
continually
reviewed
the
state
operations
throughout
the
state
as
well
as
on
these
two
projects.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
there
was
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
there
was
no
plan
as
such,
that’s
correct.
there
was
a
study
of
the
relocation
of
the
available
housing
and
there
was
--
it’s
termed
in
the
record,
a
half
of
relocation
plans
submitted
in
1966.
but
there
was
no
written
plan
as
such.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
they
“reviewed”
this.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
in
the
record
in
a
number
of
pages
most
of
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
appendix
references,
where
the
federal
authorities
went
in
and
scrutinized,
what
was
going
on
in
these
two
projects?
what
the
state
was
doing
to
relocate
the
people
and
how
they
were
providing
assistance?
and
there
is
testimony,
an
abundance
of
testimony
that
they
were
in
there
looking
at
this
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
and
that
your
honor
is
why
i
think
this
case
is
not
within
the
citizens
to
preserve
the
overton
park
decision.
this
was
not
a
review
of
a
secretary’s
“approval”
under
section
502
because
he
did
not
give
that
approval.
what
it
was
a
review
of
agency
action
under
the
statute
based
on
the
experience
of
the
federal
and
state
officials.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
do
not
because
as
we
argue
the
case,
the
secretary
was
not
required
in
this
case
to
give
the
approval.
what
was
required
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
provide
an
adequate
relocation
program,
and
that
is
what
was
being
reviewed
by
federal
authorities
and
they
determined
that
this
program
was
adequate
and
that
we
--
this
was
not
a
review
of
the
administrative
record
and
i
believe
in
overton
park,
this
case
stated
that
where
there
is
no
such
administrative
record,
it
is
entirely
appropriate
to
call
the
officials
involved
in
the
action
and
have
them
testify
and
make
a
judicial
determination
on
the
basis
of
that
testimony.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
your
honor,
the
federal
funds
were
approved.
there
was
full
payment
of
federal
funds
and
the
reason
that
that
was
required
in
this
case
was
504
(b),
section
504
(b).
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
did
not
give
an
approval
under
502.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
correct
but
he
did.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
he
did
approve
the
fact
--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
504.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor
and
that
is
one
of
provisions
that
we
concede
is
applicable
to
this
case,
the
only
one
not
as
502.
