within
the
500
miles,
are
there
projects
which
have
done
so
far
as
the
two
hearings?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
have
any
objection
to
our
reaching
an
issue
as
long
as
they
decided
the
way
you
want
us
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
that
do
for
you,
in
terms
of
the
projects
still
to
be
completed?
would
it
mean
now
that
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
requirement
at
any
of
these
projects
for
a
prior
submission
of
a
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it,
there
are
any
projects
that
are
any
less
far
along?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
within
that
8,500
miles
then
have
there
been
projects
or
are
their
still
projects
for
which
plans
will
be
submitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
68
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
the
1971
statute
that
would
not
be
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
71
statute
says,
that
if
there's
anything
not
determined
under
the
68
statute,
the
68
statute
stays,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
comply
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
comply
with
that
in

with
your
view
of
the
statute
by
not

there's
