mr.
john
a.
rowntree
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
tennessee,
the
southern
tennessee
coal
producers
involved
in
this
case
as
petitioners
charged
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
major
coal
producers
of
the
country
and
the
respondent
united
mine
workers
to
restrict
competition
and
to
raise
prices
in
the
coal
industry.
they
charged
that
the
amendments
to
the
national
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
were
use
to
the
further
the
purposes
of
this
conspiracy.
the
bcoa,
bituminous
coal
operators
association
was
organized
in
1950.
largely,
through
the
efforts
of
consolidation
coal
company,
the
largest
coal
producer.
the
head
of
consolidation
testified
in
this
case
with
respect
to
his
competitors
that
even
though
the
competitor
operated
in
poor
mining
conditions
with
the
less
productivity
than
consolidation
did
still
you
don’t
want
him
to
have
a
lower
wage
scale
than
you
if
you
can
avoid
it.
and
after
organized
bcoa
in
1950,
bcoa
proceeded
to
negotiate
with
umw
throughout
the
1950’s
and
1960’s
amendments
to
the
national
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
of
1950.
these
amendments
consisted
very
largely
of
substantial
flat
across
the
board
wage
increases
applicable
to
every
job
in
the
coal
industry
regardless
of
the
productivity
or
the
mechanization
of
the
particular
job.
these
amendments
were
taken
to
the
hundreds
of
all
the
units
in
the
industry
outside
of
bcoa
for
signing.
by
1958,
82%
of
the
industry
was
less
organized
under
the
national
contract
as
thus
amended.
then
in
december
1958,
with
the
next
two
largest
coal
associations
participating,
bcoa
negotiated
the
1958
amendment
which
included
to
protective
wage
clause,
the
pwc.
the
coal
associations
demanded
that
umw
signed
paragraph
“a”
of
the
protective
wage
clause
set
forth
at
page
11
of
our
main
brief.
this
says
that
umw
will
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
than
national
contract
terms
for
the
duration
of
the
national
contract.
this
provision
was
in
the
face
of
the
national
contract
throughout
the
damage
period
in
this
case.
the
trial
court’s
opinion
shows
that
it
is
matter
of
fact,
the
international
union
of
umw
did
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
than
national
contract
terms
with
any
unit
of
the
industry.
and
this
was
true
even
though
the
mining
conditions
be
productivity,
the
ability
to
use
the
big
new
mining
machinery
tremendously
varied
across
the
country.
the
repeated
flat
wage
increases
made
rapidly
increasing
productivity,
increasing
mechanization
and
absolute
necessity
for
any
company
to
stay
alive.
and
from
the
national
viewpoint,
from
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
there
occurred
an
industrial
revolution
through
mechanization
in
the
coal
industry
in
the
period
of
1950
to
1964.
productivity
tripled
in
a
few
short
years
and
nearly
three-fourths
of
the
men
were
forced
out
of
the
jobs
in
the
industry.
court
also
found
that
by
1960
the
class
one,
the
largest
mines
were
rapidly
regaining
the
dominant
share
of
production
that
they
held
before
world
war
ii.
the
court
also
found
that
if
you
put
the
whole
coal
industry
of
the
country
together,
taking
out
the
two
largest
producers
that
whole
industry
by
1960
was
losing
operating
losses
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
under
the
national
contract,
while
the
largest
companies
were
prospered
and
taking
over
the
industry.
now,
the
southern
--
and
that
is
the
picture
from
the
national
scene.
the
southern
tennessee
field
was
completely
organized
by
1950,
but
this
flat
wage
increases
got
beyond
the
abilities
of
the
southern
tennessee
producers.
the
trial
court
found
that
since
1960,
there
has
not
been
a
single
incident
of
a
successful
coal
mining
operation
in
southern
tennessee
under
the
national
contract
even
though
the
only
alternatives
where
they
sign
the
contract
or
go
out
a
business.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that’s
correct
and
we
say
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
and
we
say
that
the
reserves
of
the
major
companies
are
adoptable
to
this
big
new
machinery,
but
such
fields
this
southern
tennessee
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
it’s
because
they
have
great
reserves
of
coal.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
well
the
reserves
of
the
major
companies.
the
major
companies
on
the
record
do
hold
tremendous
reserves
of
millions
of
acres,
a
billions
of
tons
of
reserves
which
are
ideally
located
such
as
west
kentucky
coal
company
and
a
lot
of
proof
on
its
reserves
and
why
umw
invested
in
those
reserves.
now,
the
trial
court’s
opinion
shows
that
in
the
period
of
damage
in
this
case,
1959
to
1964,
major
companies
actually
owned
by
umw
--
triple
their
share
in
the
principle
market
of
southern
tennessee,
the
tva
market.
while
the
southern
tennessee
field
was
in
out
of
turmoil
and
confusion
and
down
with
strikes
because
of
the
inability
to
comply
with
this
national
contract.
after
the
cancellation
of
their
contracts
in
1962
by
the
union
with
demands
that
they
make
guarantees
of
future
performance,
the
southern
tennessee
operators
organized
an
association
and
attempted
to
bargain
with
umw
of
varying
set
of
wage
scales
based
upon
the
degree
of
mechanization
or
the
productivity
of
the
various
types
of
mines
in
southern
tennessee.
the
umw
refused
and
demanded
that
the
national
contract
be
signed
again,
but
this
time
with
the
guarantees
of
performance.
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
strike
which
followed
was
because
of
the
inability
to
negotiate
a
contract
in
the
field
and
this
strike
was
actually
open
warfare.
it
pervaded
three
counties.
it
went
on
for
three
years,
before
the
trial
it
was
still
going
on
at
the
trial,
this
case.
and
the
trial
court
found
that
several
men
were
killed,
a
great
deal
of
violence,
bloodshed
and
destruction
of
property
have
accompanied
the
strike
much
suffering
deprivation
and
won’t
have
occurred,
the
southern
tennessee
coal
field
remains
“ablated
area.”
now,
although
the
court
found
these
facts
both
on
the
national
level
and
on
the
local
level,
the
court
held
the
proof
was
insufficient
to
show
that
the
course
of
conduct
of
umw
was
because
of
conspiracy
or
agreement
with
major
coal
companies
and
their
associations.
the
trial
court
held
that
this
paragraph
“a”
of
the
protective
wage
clause
could
be
construed
as
umw
contended
that
it
put
a
straightjacket
or
restraint
on
umw’s
bargaining
freedom
only
with
respect
to
those
companies
that
had
gotten
organized
or
signed
up
under
the
national
contract.
it
held
that,
thus
that
it
applied
to
the
82%
return
of
the
industry
that
was
under
the
national
contract,
but
not
applicable
to
the
18%
that
had
not
been
organized
under
the
contract
--
not
under
umw’s
contracts
at
that
time.
now,
the
court
held
that
this
difference
made
the
restraint
valid
under
antitrust
law.
now,
beyond
the
express
language
of
the
contract
and
the
protective
wage
clause,
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
the
course
of
conduct
of
the
international
union
and
the
international
officers
in
dealing
with
the
industry
over
this
period
of
14
or
15
years
was
such
as
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
that
there
was
an
implied
agreement
with
bcoa
that
umw
would
negotiate
only
on
national
contract
terms
with
all
units
of
the
industry,
not
just
to
the
82%
but
to
the
100%.
but
the
court
held
that
the
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
proving
this
implied
agreement
not
just
by
preponderance
of
evidence
from
the
union’s
course
of
conduct,
but
they
have
the
duty
to
approve
it
by
the
clear
proof
rule
of
norris-laguardia
section
6
and
there
was
an
absence
of
such
clear
proof.
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
prove
a
pressure
rate
conspiracy
to
drive
small
coal
companies
out
of
the
industry.
but
the
court
added
at
the
end
of
this
conclusion
that
were
it
not
for
the
clear
proof
rule,
the
court
might
have
reached
different
conclusions.
now,
it
is
obvious
from
the
trial
court’s
opinion
throughout
that
it
was
applying
this
clear
proof
rule
all
the
way
to
the
point
of
reaching
final
conclusions
as
to
antitrust
violation
regardless
of
the
clarity
of
proof
of
authorization
of
the
course
of
conduct
of
the
international
union
and
its
officers
over
this
period
of
14
years.
regardless
of
that
authorization
--
obvious
authorization,
the
clear
proof
rule
was
applied
to
that
course
of
conduct
to
reach
a
conclusion
as
to
whether
that
was
a
violation
of
law
and
the
trial
court
rejected
the
majority
and
concurring
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
pennington
decision
of
1965
saying
that
neither
opinion
expressed
through
majority
rule
of
this
court
and
it
added
that
the
problem
suppose
to
the
small
and
medium
size
enterprises
by
the
practice
of
national
collective
bargaining
would
appear
real
and
substantial.
however,
that
their
solution
lies
in
the
federal
antitrust
laws
as
now
enacted
by
congress
is
doubtful.
this
was
a
decision
just
a
few
months
after
the
decision
of
this
court
remanding
pennington
for
trial
under
the
antitrust
laws
on
its
similar
issues.
the
one
point
from
this
court’s
opinions
in
pennington
which
most
impressed
the
trial
court
was
derived
from
the
second
footnote
of
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
white.
we
think
the
court
misconstrued
this
footnote.
obviously,
the
court
construed
this
footnote
to
me
that
the
union
needs
to
deal
in
good
faith
bargaining
only
with
the
dominant
unit
of
the
industry
and
over
a
period
of
15
years
can
take
the
resulting
contracts
and
cram
them
down
the
throats
of
hundreds
of
other
units
and
all
sorts
of
varying
circumstances
without
changing
a
single
comma
in
a
single
contract
over
that
whole
period.
even
though,
it
means
obvious
repression
of
competition
and
even
though
it
means
tragic
effects
on
three-fourths
of
the
union’s
membership,
while
the
favored
companies
grow
and
prosper
and
take
over
the
industry.
now,
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
with
these
views
of
the
law
applicable
to
these
circumstances
and
they
reverse
the
judgments
in
favor
of
umw.
on
umw’s
petition
to
rehear
en
banc
the
full
court
reconsidered
spilt
four
to
four
and
reinstated
the
judgments.
under
the
first
question
we
raise
here,
we
contend
that
the
lower
courts
were
in
error.
in
holding
that
to
be
successful,
the
plaintiffs
must
show
that
this
clearly
authorized
course
of
conduct
of
the
international
union
and
its
offices
must
be
such
as
to
show
antitrust
violation
not
just
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence.
but
this
clearly
authorize
course
of
conduct
must
be
such
as
to
show
clearly
unequivocally
and
convincingly
that
antitrust
law
was
violated.
now,
section
6
of
norris-laguardia
by
its
very
language
expresses
merely
a
rule
of
evidence
in
proving
agency
or
authorization
of
acts
in
a
labor
dispute.
the
section
has
nothing
to
say
about
legal
standards
applicable
in
evaluating
clearly
authorized
course
of
conduct
or
clearly
authorized
acts
in
evaluating
the
legality
of
such
acts.
the
act
assumes
that
acts
have
been
done
in
a
labor
dispute
which
violates
the
law
and
the
statute
is
concerned
with
the
proof
of
authorization
of
those
acts.
it
has
nothing
to
say
about
whether
or
not
what
legal
standards
are
to
be
applied
to
determine
whether
the
acts
truly
were
unlawful.
now,
all
the
issues
in
this
case
obviously
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
authorization
of
the
course
of
conduct
in
bargaining
with
the
industry
over
15
years
of
this
international
union
and
its
officers.
obviously,
the
issues
must
be
centered
upon
the
legal
standards
to
be
applied
to
this
course
of
conduct
and
the
effects
in
consequences
of
that
conduct
over
this
period
of
time
and
neither
the
legislative
history
nor
the
opinions
of
this
court
support
the
conclusions
and
construction
below
with
the
respect
to
section
6.
the
trial
court
found
a
umw
bcoa
implicit
agreement
violating
antitrust
policy
on
a
preponderance
of
evidence
and
we
say
this
finding
should
have
resulted
in
judgments
for
these
plaintiffs.
under
question
two,
we
deal
with
the
express
language
of
the
national
contract
in
the
protective
wage
clause,
paragraph
“a”
set
forth
at
page
11
of
our
main
brief.
this
language
was
demanded
by
the
coal
associations.
it
says
that
umw
will
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
than
national
contract
terms
for
the
duration
of
the
national
contract.
now,
the
trial
court
went
along
with
umw’s
we
submit
rather
round
about
argument
to
restrict
this
restraint
to
the
82%
of
the
industry
that
had
signed
up
under
the
national
contract.
and
the
court
held
that
made
it
valid
since
the
18%
for
that
that
was
not
organized
or
was
not
included
in
the
restraint.
now,
we
were
contending
that
such
a
restraint
is
this,
even
if
limited
to
the
82%
of
the
industry
including
southern
tennessee,
the
method
--
hundreds
of
companies
would
be
wiped
out
during
the
duration
of
the
national
contract
without
any
freedom
at
all
to
bargain
over
modified
terms
over
terms
that
were
practical
and
workable
in
the
situations
that
were
present
or
that
might
develop
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
and
that
this
meant
a
deprivation
of
bargaining
freedom
for
the
duration
of
the
national
contract
which
was
not
amended
again
until
1964
at
the
end
of
the
damage
period
of
this
case
and
we
say
it’s
still
goes
on
today
that
this
matter
of
deprivation
of
bargaining
freedom
for
great
segments
for
the
coal
industry.
the
companies
were
induced
to
sign
national
contracts
by
all
sorts
of
reasons
mostly
violence,
but
by
economic
pressure
by
all
sorts
also.
and
we
say,
it
is
a
rule
of
law
that
will
not
work
to
say
that
the
dominant
companies
can
direct
the
union
to
keep
all
these
companies
under
a
contract,
under
impractical
terms.
the
violence
and
the
warfare
of
southern
tennessee
is
just
an
example
of
the
efforts
of
people
to
stay
alive
and
maintain
their
only
way
of
living
in
the
face
of
such
a
rule
and
the
struggle
was
going
on
in
numerous
coal
fields
that
is
shown
by
the
many
reported
federal
cases
dealing
with
violence
in
this
union
in
the
period
of
1959
or
1960.
and
the
results
could
be
predicted,
they
are
obvious
today
repress
competition
rising
coal
prices
set
by
in
all
the
company
of
big
energy
companies.
umw
in
its
reply
brief
now
says,
no
restraint
at
all
was
put
on
umw
in
this
paragraph
“a.”
it
says
now,
that
the
whole
meaning
of
paragraph
“a”
is
included
within
the
last
clause
of
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph
dealing
with
umw’s
obligation
to
enforce
the
contract
against
all
signatories.
it
says
now,
that
all
the
preceding
language
that
umw
will
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
the
national
contract
terms
for
the
duration
of
contract
all
that
adds
nothing
to
the
meaning
of
the
last
clause
about
enforcing
the
contract
against
all
signatories.
now,
we
submit
that
this
present
argument
will
not
hold
water
as
a
bare
reading
of
the
clause
demonstrates.
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
this
language
was
demanded
by
the
major
coal
associations.
umw’s
brief
argues
that
even
if
this
paragraph
did
impose
a
restraint
on
umw’s
bargaining
freedom,
still
umw
had
a
legal
right
to
a
uniform
wage
scale
throughout
the
industry
and
therefore
the
paragraph
does
not
express
anything
other
than
what
umw
had
a
legal
right
to
do
anyway.
but
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is,
that
even
if
umw
did
have
a
right
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
bargaining
with
the
dominant
unit
and
showing
this
a
resulting
contracts
down,
all
these
other
--
upon
all
these
other
units
over
this
period
of
15
years
still
it
did
not
have
a
legal
right
to
bind
itself
for
the
major
coal
associations
and
companies
to
pursue
that
policy
in
the
industry.
clearly,
this
is
what
umw
has
done
to
the
suppression
of
a
great
segment
of
the
coal
industry.
now,
third
question
that
brought
us
to
the
three
questions
we
raised,
we
assert
that
there
should
be
at
least
a
prima
facie
case
of
antitrust
violation
from
the
union’s
force
of
conduct
and
the
effects
and
consequences
over
this
period
of
time
of
that
conduct
even
without
the
undisputed
proof
that
the
coal
associations
were
making
demands
upon
umw
to
restraint
it
in
its
bargaining
policy.
now,
the
lower
court
decisions
emphasized
exclusively
the
right,
so
called
right
of
the
union
to
have
a
uniform
wage
scale
throughout
an
industry
and
obviously
the
courts
think
this
means
that
the
union
can
deal
in
bona
fide
bargaining
only
with
the
dominant
unit
and
can
carry
out
this
practice
of
going
through
the
so
called
negotiations
but
never
changing
a
single
common,
a
single
contract
with
the
single
unit
of
the
hundreds
of
other
units
who
role
this
period
with
all
these
varying
circumstances
and
with
the
obvious
repression
of
competition
is
going
on
like
i
said
in
tennessee.
now,
we
say
that
this
emphasis
on
a
uniform
wage
scale
really
gives
no
right
whatsoever,
no
recognition,
no
reconciliation
to
rights
of
the
hundreds
of
all
the
units
not
only
under
antitrust
law
but
also
under
national
labor
policy
and
national
employment
policy.
the
lower
court
decisions
subordinate
obviously
the
antitrust
law
in
this
case
allowing
this
iron
bound
completely
unfair
uniformity
policy
direct
economic
devastation
over
a
three
county
area
for
three
years
to
say
nothing
about
the
effects
nationally.
the
lower
court
decisions
frustrate
the
most
basic
purposes
of
national
labor
policy,
making
it
obviously
impossible
for
hundreds
of
employers
to
deal
and
any
freedom
at
all
with
their
employees
of
that
terms
and
conditions
where
they
are
situated,
making
the
conflict
in
the
turmoil
and
finally
open
warfare
shown
in
tennessee
absolutely
necessary
the
very
things
which
the
national
labor
statutes
expressly
were
passed
to
avoid
the
conflict,
the
turmoil.
the
lower
court
decisions
ignored
completely
the
national
employment
act
which
act
was
passed
six
years
after
the
apex
decision.
the
national
labor
act
--
employment
act
says
that
our
national
employment
policy
shall
be
such
as
to
promote
the
free
enterprise
system,
the
free
competitive
enterprise
system
and
it
says
that
our
national
employment
policy
shall
be
such
as
to
promote
those
conditions
which
afford
maximum
employment.
now,
this
policy
is
obviously
frustrated
by
the
lower
court
decisions
which
require
that
these
hundreds
of
all
the
companies
stick
to
the
demands
of
the
umw
bcoa
unit
that
they
fire
great
masses
of
their
employees
and
substitute
heavy
machinery
or
be
destroyed
throughout
of
business.
now,
the
joined
economic
committee
of
congress
has
spoken
out
strongly
in
recent
years
about
this
very
kind
of
anti-competitive
and
anti-job
rulemaking
policy.
but
we
say
that
the
principle
answer
to
this
present
reliance
upon
a
so
called
uniform
wage
scale
throughout
an
industry
is
the
fact
that
paragraph
“a”
was
demanded
by
the
major
coal
associations
and
the
court
found
on
a
preponderance
of
evidence
that
this
was
intended
to
be
applied
not
just
to
the
82%
of
industry
but
to
the
100%
of
the
industry.
now,
we
don’t
think
that
the
multi-employer
bargaining
rules
cut
across
this
case
at
all.
this
court
held
or
said
in
volkswagenwerk
versus
federal
maritime
commission
390
u.s.
that
the
kind
of
multi-employer
bargaining
that
conforms
with
national
labor
policy
is
free
collective-bargaining
by
representatives
of
the
parties
owned
unfettered
choice.
now,
we
say
that
that
will
not
encompass
this
practice
of
binding
together
hundreds
of
units
of
an
industry
under
one
national
contract
and
all
sorts
of
situations
getting
them
under
there
mostly
by
violence
and
then
allowing
the
dominant
companies
to
direct
the
union.
now,
keep
all
these
companies
under
this
contract
regardless
of
the
practicality
of
the
terms
for
the
duration
of
our
national
contract.
now,
this
is
just
one
way
to
squeeze
competition
out
of
an
industry,
but
this
is
the
way
it
was
done
in
the
coal
industry.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
direct
on
the
remand
in
these
two
cases
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
on
this
record
to
establish
a
violation
of
antitrust
law.
thank
you.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
says
that
the
court
gave
a
complete
overview
at
the
end
of
his
case.
however,
he
pronounced
the
continental
or
rule
about
having
to
judge
the
whole
case
is
complete
picture,
but
he
did
proceed
again
to
dismember
the
case
and
then
this
dismemberment
and
the
overview.
he
never
looked
at
this
protective
wage
clause
again
and
you
can’t
interpret
that
protective
wage
clause
particularly
paragraph
“a”
without
looking
at
the
whole
picture
of
this
case.
we
ask
the
court
to
read
it,
the
paragraph
“a”
particularly.
i
think
its
stretching
construction
beyond
reason
to
whole
that
it’s
limited
to
the
82%
of
the
industry
in
the
first
place.
but
we
say
even
if
it
is
confined
to
the
82%
of
the
industry,
still
it’s
going
to
mean
inevitably
that
hundreds
of
companies
are
going
to
be
deprived
of
any
right
to
survive
in
this
industry.
now,
the
application
of
the
clear
proof
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
you
could
belong
to
bcoa
or
not.
we
take
the
illinois
coal
operators
association,
one
of
the
two
largest
--
one
of
the
three
largest
associations.
they
sought
freedom
from
bcoa
according
to
this
record
for
many
years
and
finally
went
into
it.
but
and
they
sought
it
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
alright,
i
think
it’s
about
five
cases.
now,
the
first
two
or
first
pennington
we
brought
that
here.
now,
then
there
was
second
pennington
where
we
lost
without
a
jury
and
clearly
that
court
upon
this
clear
proof
rule
all
the
way
to
prove
and
predatory
intent
by
clear
proof.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
the
two
judges
who
considered
it
were
judge
tyler
in
second
pennington.
he
held
--
we
have
to
prove
predatory
intent
by
clear
proof
to
win
and
the
second
judge
was
judge
wilson
in
this
case
and
that’s
all.
now,
two
juries
have
held
to
the
contrary
that
protective
wage
clause
was
intended
to
be
applied
to
the
whole
industry
as
obviously
it
was.
and
this
was
a
restraint
on
the
economic
freedom
of
the
whole
industry.
this
clause
says
that
union
will
not
make
any
change
in
any
of
these
units
that
it’s
got
the
contract
on.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
we
say
that
it
should
be
per
se
violation,
your
honor.
regardless
of
purpose
or
effect
as
your
honor
said
in
pennington.
this
must
be
a
per
se
violation.
the
employers
in
the
dominant
units
got
no
right
to
tell
the
union
what
it
can
do
in
the
other
units.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
your
honor
says
that
such
an
agreement
that
is
an
agreement
to
apply
certain
wage
to
terms
in
other
units
violates
antitrust
policy
regardless
of
purpose
or
effect
and
we
say
that
should
be
the
law.
it’s
got
to
be
the
law.
the
dominant
units
can’t
tell
the
union
how
to
conduct
itself
in
these
other
bargaining
units
and
we
say
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that
the
law
cannot
allow
the
dominant
unit
to
keep
all
the
other
bargaining
units
under
the
same
terms
for
the
duration
of
the
understandings
between
the
dominant
unit
and
the
union.
in
other
words,
this
national
contract
still
goes
on
today
and
if
the
other
units
can’t
change
their
terms
during
the
continuation
of
the
national
contract,
we
never
will
have
any
competition
in
this
industry,
it’s
practically
going
today.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
tennessee,
the
southern
tennessee
coal
producers
involved
in
this
case
as
petitioners
charged
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
major
coal
producers
of
the
country
and
the
respondent
united
mine
workers
to
restrict
competition
and
to
raise
prices
in
the
coal
industry.
they
charged
that
the
amendments
to
the
national
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
were
use
to
the
further
the
purposes
of
this
conspiracy.
the
bcoa,
bituminous
coal
operators
association
was
organized
in
1950.
largely,
through
the
efforts
of
consolidation
coal
company,
the
largest
coal
producer.
the
head
of
consolidation
testified
in
this
case
with
respect
to
his
competitors
that
even
though
the
competitor
operated
in
poor
mining
conditions
with
the
less
productivity
than
consolidation
did
still
you
don’t
want
him
to
have
a
lower
wage
scale
than
you
if
you
can
avoid
it.
and
after
organized
bcoa
in
1950,
bcoa
proceeded
to
negotiate
with
umw
throughout
the
1950’s
and
1960’s
amendments
to
the
national
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
of
1950.
these
amendments
consisted
very
largely
of
substantial
flat
across
the
board
wage
increases
applicable
to
every
job
in
the
coal
industry
regardless
of
the
productivity
or
the
mechanization
of
the
particular
job.
these
amendments
were
taken
to
the
hundreds
of
all
the
units
in
the
industry
outside
of
bcoa
for
signing.
by
1958,
82%
of
the
industry
was
less
organized
under
the
national
contract
as
thus
amended.
then
in
december
1958,
with
the
next
two
largest
coal
associations
participating,
bcoa
negotiated
the
1958
amendment
which
included
to
protective
wage
clause,
the
pwc.
the
coal
associations
demanded
that
umw
signed
paragraph
“a”
of
the
protective
wage
clause
set
forth
at
page
11
of
our
main
brief.
this
says
that
umw
will
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
than
national
contract
terms
for
the
duration
of
the
national
contract.
this
provision
was
in
the
face
of
the
national
contract
throughout
the
damage
period
in
this
case.
the
trial
court’s
opinion
shows
that
it
is
matter
of
fact,
the
international
union
of
umw
did
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
than
national
contract
terms
with
any
unit
of
the
industry.
and
this
was
true
even
though
the
mining
conditions
be
productivity,
the
ability
to
use
the
big
new
mining
machinery
tremendously
varied
across
the
country.
the
repeated
flat
wage
increases
made
rapidly
increasing
productivity,
increasing
mechanization
and
absolute
necessity
for
any
company
to
stay
alive.
and
from
the
national
viewpoint,
from
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
there
occurred
an
industrial
revolution
through
mechanization
in
the
coal
industry
in
the
period
of
1950
to
1964.
productivity
tripled
in
a
few
short
years
and
nearly
three-fourths
of
the
men
were
forced
out
of
the
jobs
in
the
industry.
court
also
found
that
by
1960
the
class
one,
the
largest
mines
were
rapidly
regaining
the
dominant
share
of
production
that
they
held
before
world
war
ii.
the
court
also
found
that
if
you
put
the
whole
coal
industry
of
the
country
together,
taking
out
the
two
largest
producers
that
whole
industry
by
1960
was
losing
operating
losses
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
under
the
national
contract,
while
the
largest
companies
were
prospered
and
taking
over
the
industry.
now,
the
southern
--
and
that
is
the
picture
from
the
national
scene.
the
southern
tennessee
field
was
completely
organized
by
1950,
but
this
flat
wage
increases
got
beyond
the
abilities
of
the
southern
tennessee
producers.
the
trial
court
found
that
since
1960,
there
has
not
been
a
single
incident
of
a
successful
coal
mining
operation
in
southern
tennessee
under
the
national
contract
even
though
the
only
alternatives
where
they
sign
the
contract
or
go
out
a
business.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that’s
correct
and
we
say
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
and
we
say
that
the
reserves
of
the
major
companies
are
adoptable
to
this
big
new
machinery,
but
such
fields
this
southern
tennessee
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
it’s
because
they
have
great
reserves
of
coal.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
well
the
reserves
of
the
major
companies.
the
major
companies
on
the
record
do
hold
tremendous
reserves
of
millions
of
acres,
a
billions
of
tons
of
reserves
which
are
ideally
located
such
as
west
kentucky
coal
company
and
a
lot
of
proof
on
its
reserves
and
why
umw
invested
in
those
reserves.
now,
the
trial
court’s
opinion
shows
that
in
the
period
of
damage
in
this
case,
1959
to
1964,
major
companies
actually
owned
by
umw
--
triple
their
share
in
the
principle
market
of
southern
tennessee,
the
tva
market.
while
the
southern
tennessee
field
was
in
out
of
turmoil
and
confusion
and
down
with
strikes
because
of
the
inability
to
comply
with
this
national
contract.
after
the
cancellation
of
their
contracts
in
1962
by
the
union
with
demands
that
they
make
guarantees
of
future
performance,
the
southern
tennessee
operators
organized
an
association
and
attempted
to
bargain
with
umw
of
varying
set
of
wage
scales
based
upon
the
degree
of
mechanization
or
the
productivity
of
the
various
types
of
mines
in
southern
tennessee.
the
umw
refused
and
demanded
that
the
national
contract
be
signed
again,
but
this
time
with
the
guarantees
of
performance.
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
strike
which
followed
was
because
of
the
inability
to
negotiate
a
contract
in
the
field
and
this
strike
was
actually
open
warfare.
it
pervaded
three
counties.
it
went
on
for
three
years,
before
the
trial
it
was
still
going
on
at
the
trial,
this
case.
and
the
trial
court
found
that
several
men
were
killed,
a
great
deal
of
violence,
bloodshed
and
destruction
of
property
have
accompanied
the
strike
much
suffering
deprivation
and
won’t
have
occurred,
the
southern
tennessee
coal
field
remains
“ablated
area.”
now,
although
the
court
found
these
facts
both
on
the
national
level
and
on
the
local
level,
the
court
held
the
proof
was
insufficient
to
show
that
the
course
of
conduct
of
umw
was
because
of
conspiracy
or
agreement
with
major
coal
companies
and
their
associations.
the
trial
court
held
that
this
paragraph
“a”
of
the
protective
wage
clause
could
be
construed
as
umw
contended
that
it
put
a
straightjacket
or
restraint
on
umw’s
bargaining
freedom
only
with
respect
to
those
companies
that
had
gotten
organized
or
signed
up
under
the
national
contract.
it
held
that,
thus
that
it
applied
to
the
82%
return
of
the
industry
that
was
under
the
national
contract,
but
not
applicable
to
the
18%
that
had
not
been
organized
under
the
contract
--
not
under
umw’s
contracts
at
that
time.
now,
the
court
held
that
this
difference
made
the
restraint
valid
under
antitrust
law.
now,
beyond
the
express
language
of
the
contract
and
the
protective
wage
clause,
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
the
course
of
conduct
of
the
international
union
and
the
international
officers
in
dealing
with
the
industry
over
this
period
of
14
or
15
years
was
such
as
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
that
there
was
an
implied
agreement
with
bcoa
that
umw
would
negotiate
only
on
national
contract
terms
with
all
units
of
the
industry,
not
just
to
the
82%
but
to
the
100%.
but
the
court
held
that
the
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
proving
this
implied
agreement
not
just
by
preponderance
of
evidence
from
the
union’s
course
of
conduct,
but
they
have
the
duty
to
approve
it
by
the
clear
proof
rule
of
norris-laguardia
section
6
and
there
was
an
absence
of
such
clear
proof.
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
prove
a
pressure
rate
conspiracy
to
drive
small
coal
companies
out
of
the
industry.
but
the
court
added
at
the
end
of
this
conclusion
that
were
it
not
for
the
clear
proof
rule,
the
court
might
have
reached
different
conclusions.
now,
it
is
obvious
from
the
trial
court’s
opinion
throughout
that
it
was
applying
this
clear
proof
rule
all
the
way
to
the
point
of
reaching
final
conclusions
as
to
antitrust
violation
regardless
of
the
clarity
of
proof
of
authorization
of
the
course
of
conduct
of
the
international
union
and
its
officers
over
this
period
of
14
years.
regardless
of
that
authorization
--
obvious
authorization,
the
clear
proof
rule
was
applied
to
that
course
of
conduct
to
reach
a
conclusion
as
to
whether
that
was
a
violation
of
law
and
the
trial
court
rejected
the
majority
and
concurring
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
pennington
decision
of
1965
saying
that
neither
opinion
expressed
through
majority
rule
of
this
court
and
it
added
that
the
problem
suppose
to
the
small
and
medium
size
enterprises
by
the
practice
of
national
collective
bargaining
would
appear
real
and
substantial.
however,
that
their
solution
lies
in
the
federal
antitrust
laws
as
now
enacted
by
congress
is
doubtful.
this
was
a
decision
just
a
few
months
after
the
decision
of
this
court
remanding
pennington
for
trial
under
the
antitrust
laws
on
its
similar
issues.
the
one
point
from
this
court’s
opinions
in
pennington
which
most
impressed
the
trial
court
was
derived
from
the
second
footnote
of
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
white.
we
think
the
court
misconstrued
this
footnote.
obviously,
the
court
construed
this
footnote
to
me
that
the
union
needs
to
deal
in
good
faith
bargaining
only
with
the
dominant
unit
of
the
industry
and
over
a
period
of
15
years
can
take
the
resulting
contracts
and
cram
them
down
the
throats
of
hundreds
of
other
units
and
all
sorts
of
varying
circumstances
without
changing
a
single
comma
in
a
single
contract
over
that
whole
period.
even
though,
it
means
obvious
repression
of
competition
and
even
though
it
means
tragic
effects
on
three-fourths
of
the
union’s
membership,
while
the
favored
companies
grow
and
prosper
and
take
over
the
industry.
now,
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
with
these
views
of
the
law
applicable
to
these
circumstances
and
they
reverse
the
judgments
in
favor
of
umw.
on
umw’s
petition
to
rehear
en
banc
the
full
court
reconsidered
spilt
four
to
four
and
reinstated
the
judgments.
under
the
first
question
we
raise
here,
we
contend
that
the
lower
courts
were
in
error.
in
holding
that
to
be
successful,
the
plaintiffs
must
show
that
this
clearly
authorized
course
of
conduct
of
the
international
union
and
its
offices
must
be
such
as
to
show
antitrust
violation
not
just
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence.
but
this
clearly
authorize
course
of
conduct
must
be
such
as
to
show
clearly
unequivocally
and
convincingly
that
antitrust
law
was
violated.
now,
section
6
of
norris-laguardia
by
its
very
language
expresses
merely
a
rule
of
evidence
in
proving
agency
or
authorization
of
acts
in
a
labor
dispute.
the
section
has
nothing
to
say
about
legal
standards
applicable
in
evaluating
clearly
authorized
course
of
conduct
or
clearly
authorized
acts
in
evaluating
the
legality
of
such
acts.
the
act
assumes
that
acts
have
been
done
in
a
labor
dispute
which
violates
the
law
and
the
statute
is
concerned
with
the
proof
of
authorization
of
those
acts.
it
has
nothing
to
say
about
whether
or
not
what
legal
standards
are
to
be
applied
to
determine
whether
the
acts
truly
were
unlawful.
now,
all
the
issues
in
this
case
obviously
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
authorization
of
the
course
of
conduct
in
bargaining
with
the
industry
over
15
years
of
this
international
union
and
its
officers.
obviously,
the
issues
must
be
centered
upon
the
legal
standards
to
be
applied
to
this
course
of
conduct
and
the
effects
in
consequences
of
that
conduct
over
this
period
of
time
and
neither
the
legislative
history
nor
the
opinions
of
this
court
support
the
conclusions
and
construction
below
with
the
respect
to
section
6.
the
trial
court
found
a
umw
bcoa
implicit
agreement
violating
antitrust
policy
on
a
preponderance
of
evidence
and
we
say
this
finding
should
have
resulted
in
judgments
for
these
plaintiffs.
under
question
two,
we
deal
with
the
express
language
of
the
national
contract
in
the
protective
wage
clause,
paragraph
“a”
set
forth
at
page
11
of
our
main
brief.
this
language
was
demanded
by
the
coal
associations.
it
says
that
umw
will
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
than
national
contract
terms
for
the
duration
of
the
national
contract.
now,
the
trial
court
went
along
with
umw’s
we
submit
rather
round
about
argument
to
restrict
this
restraint
to
the
82%
of
the
industry
that
had
signed
up
under
the
national
contract.
and
the
court
held
that
made
it
valid
since
the
18%
for
that
that
was
not
organized
or
was
not
included
in
the
restraint.
now,
we
were
contending
that
such
a
restraint
is
this,
even
if
limited
to
the
82%
of
the
industry
including
southern
tennessee,
the
method
--
hundreds
of
companies
would
be
wiped
out
during
the
duration
of
the
national
contract
without
any
freedom
at
all
to
bargain
over
modified
terms
over
terms
that
were
practical
and
workable
in
the
situations
that
were
present
or
that
might
develop
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
and
that
this
meant
a
deprivation
of
bargaining
freedom
for
the
duration
of
the
national
contract
which
was
not
amended
again
until
1964
at
the
end
of
the
damage
period
of
this
case
and
we
say
it’s
still
goes
on
today
that
this
matter
of
deprivation
of
bargaining
freedom
for
great
segments
for
the
coal
industry.
the
companies
were
induced
to
sign
national
contracts
by
all
sorts
of
reasons
mostly
violence,
but
by
economic
pressure
by
all
sorts
also.
and
we
say,
it
is
a
rule
of
law
that
will
not
work
to
say
that
the
dominant
companies
can
direct
the
union
to
keep
all
these
companies
under
a
contract,
under
impractical
terms.
the
violence
and
the
warfare
of
southern
tennessee
is
just
an
example
of
the
efforts
of
people
to
stay
alive
and
maintain
their
only
way
of
living
in
the
face
of
such
a
rule
and
the
struggle
was
going
on
in
numerous
coal
fields
that
is
shown
by
the
many
reported
federal
cases
dealing
with
violence
in
this
union
in
the
period
of
1959
or
1960.
and
the
results
could
be
predicted,
they
are
obvious
today
repress
competition
rising
coal
prices
set
by
in
all
the
company
of
big
energy
companies.
umw
in
its
reply
brief
now
says,
no
restraint
at
all
was
put
on
umw
in
this
paragraph
“a.”
it
says
now,
that
the
whole
meaning
of
paragraph
“a”
is
included
within
the
last
clause
of
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph
dealing
with
umw’s
obligation
to
enforce
the
contract
against
all
signatories.
it
says
now,
that
all
the
preceding
language
that
umw
will
not
enter
into
become
a
party
to
or
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
other
the
national
contract
terms
for
the
duration
of
contract
all
that
adds
nothing
to
the
meaning
of
the
last
clause
about
enforcing
the
contract
against
all
signatories.
now,
we
submit
that
this
present
argument
will
not
hold
water
as
a
bare
reading
of
the
clause
demonstrates.
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
this
language
was
demanded
by
the
major
coal
associations.
umw’s
brief
argues
that
even
if
this
paragraph
did
impose
a
restraint
on
umw’s
bargaining
freedom,
still
umw
had
a
legal
right
to
a
uniform
wage
scale
throughout
the
industry
and
therefore
the
paragraph
does
not
express
anything
other
than
what
umw
had
a
legal
right
to
do
anyway.
but
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is,
that
even
if
umw
did
have
a
right
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
bargaining
with
the
dominant
unit
and
showing
this
a
resulting
contracts
down,
all
these
other
--
upon
all
these
other
units
over
this
period
of
15
years
still
it
did
not
have
a
legal
right
to
bind
itself
for
the
major
coal
associations
and
companies
to
pursue
that
policy
in
the
industry.
clearly,
this
is
what
umw
has
done
to
the
suppression
of
a
great
segment
of
the
coal
industry.
now,
third
question
that
brought
us
to
the
three
questions
we
raised,
we
assert
that
there
should
be
at
least
a
prima
facie
case
of
antitrust
violation
from
the
union’s
force
of
conduct
and
the
effects
and
consequences
over
this
period
of
time
of
that
conduct
even
without
the
undisputed
proof
that
the
coal
associations
were
making
demands
upon
umw
to
restraint
it
in
its
bargaining
policy.
now,
the
lower
court
decisions
emphasized
exclusively
the
right,
so
called
right
of
the
union
to
have
a
uniform
wage
scale
throughout
an
industry
and
obviously
the
courts
think
this
means
that
the
union
can
deal
in
bona
fide
bargaining
only
with
the
dominant
unit
and
can
carry
out
this
practice
of
going
through
the
so
called
negotiations
but
never
changing
a
single
common,
a
single
contract
with
the
single
unit
of
the
hundreds
of
other
units
who
role
this
period
with
all
these
varying
circumstances
and
with
the
obvious
repression
of
competition
is
going
on
like
i
said
in
tennessee.
now,
we
say
that
this
emphasis
on
a
uniform
wage
scale
really
gives
no
right
whatsoever,
no
recognition,
no
reconciliation
to
rights
of
the
hundreds
of
all
the
units
not
only
under
antitrust
law
but
also
under
national
labor
policy
and
national
employment
policy.
the
lower
court
decisions
subordinate
obviously
the
antitrust
law
in
this
case
allowing
this
iron
bound
completely
unfair
uniformity
policy
direct
economic
devastation
over
a
three
county
area
for
three
years
to
say
nothing
about
the
effects
nationally.
the
lower
court
decisions
frustrate
the
most
basic
purposes
of
national
labor
policy,
making
it
obviously
impossible
for
hundreds
of
employers
to
deal
and
any
freedom
at
all
with
their
employees
of
that
terms
and
conditions
where
they
are
situated,
making
the
conflict
in
the
turmoil
and
finally
open
warfare
shown
in
tennessee
absolutely
necessary
the
very
things
which
the
national
labor
statutes
expressly
were
passed
to
avoid
the
conflict,
the
turmoil.
the
lower
court
decisions
ignored
completely
the
national
employment
act
which
act
was
passed
six
years
after
the
apex
decision.
the
national
labor
act
--
employment
act
says
that
our
national
employment
policy
shall
be
such
as
to
promote
the
free
enterprise
system,
the
free
competitive
enterprise
system
and
it
says
that
our
national
employment
policy
shall
be
such
as
to
promote
those
conditions
which
afford
maximum
employment.
now,
this
policy
is
obviously
frustrated
by
the
lower
court
decisions
which
require
that
these
hundreds
of
all
the
companies
stick
to
the
demands
of
the
umw
bcoa
unit
that
they
fire
great
masses
of
their
employees
and
substitute
heavy
machinery
or
be
destroyed
throughout
of
business.
now,
the
joined
economic
committee
of
congress
has
spoken
out
strongly
in
recent
years
about
this
very
kind
of
anti-competitive
and
anti-job
rulemaking
policy.
but
we
say
that
the
principle
answer
to
this
present
reliance
upon
a
so
called
uniform
wage
scale
throughout
an
industry
is
the
fact
that
paragraph
“a”
was
demanded
by
the
major
coal
associations
and
the
court
found
on
a
preponderance
of
evidence
that
this
was
intended
to
be
applied
not
just
to
the
82%
of
industry
but
to
the
100%
of
the
industry.
now,
we
don’t
think
that
the
multi-employer
bargaining
rules
cut
across
this
case
at
all.
this
court
held
or
said
in
volkswagenwerk
versus
federal
maritime
commission
390
u.s.
that
the
kind
of
multi-employer
bargaining
that
conforms
with
national
labor
policy
is
free
collective-bargaining
by
representatives
of
the
parties
owned
unfettered
choice.
now,
we
say
that
that
will
not
encompass
this
practice
of
binding
together
hundreds
of
units
of
an
industry
under
one
national
contract
and
all
sorts
of
situations
getting
them
under
there
mostly
by
violence
and
then
allowing
the
dominant
companies
to
direct
the
union.
now,
keep
all
these
companies
under
this
contract
regardless
of
the
practicality
of
the
terms
for
the
duration
of
our
national
contract.
now,
this
is
just
one
way
to
squeeze
competition
out
of
an
industry,
but
this
is
the
way
it
was
done
in
the
coal
industry.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
direct
on
the
remand
in
these
two
cases
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
on
this
record
to
establish
a
violation
of
antitrust
law.
thank
you.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
says
that
the
court
gave
a
complete
overview
at
the
end
of
his
case.
however,
he
pronounced
the
continental
or
rule
about
having
to
judge
the
whole
case
is
complete
picture,
but
he
did
proceed
again
to
dismember
the
case
and
then
this
dismemberment
and
the
overview.
he
never
looked
at
this
protective
wage
clause
again
and
you
can’t
interpret
that
protective
wage
clause
particularly
paragraph
“a”
without
looking
at
the
whole
picture
of
this
case.
we
ask
the
court
to
read
it,
the
paragraph
“a”
particularly.
i
think
its
stretching
construction
beyond
reason
to
whole
that
it’s
limited
to
the
82%
of
the
industry
in
the
first
place.
but
we
say
even
if
it
is
confined
to
the
82%
of
the
industry,
still
it’s
going
to
mean
inevitably
that
hundreds
of
companies
are
going
to
be
deprived
of
any
right
to
survive
in
this
industry.
now,
the
application
of
the
clear
proof
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
you
could
belong
to
bcoa
or
not.
we
take
the
illinois
coal
operators
association,
one
of
the
two
largest
--
one
of
the
three
largest
associations.
they
sought
freedom
from
bcoa
according
to
this
record
for
many
years
and
finally
went
into
it.
but
and
they
sought
it
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
alright,
i
think
it’s
about
five
cases.
now,
the
first
two
or
first
pennington
we
brought
that
here.
now,
then
there
was
second
pennington
where
we
lost
without
a
jury
and
clearly
that
court
upon
this
clear
proof
rule
all
the
way
to
prove
and
predatory
intent
by
clear
proof.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
the
two
judges
who
considered
it
were
judge
tyler
in
second
pennington.
he
held
--
we
have
to
prove
predatory
intent
by
clear
proof
to
win
and
the
second
judge
was
judge
wilson
in
this
case
and
that’s
all.
now,
two
juries
have
held
to
the
contrary
that
protective
wage
clause
was
intended
to
be
applied
to
the
whole
industry
as
obviously
it
was.
and
this
was
a
restraint
on
the
economic
freedom
of
the
whole
industry.
this
clause
says
that
union
will
not
make
any
change
in
any
of
these
units
that
it’s
got
the
contract
on.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
we
say
that
it
should
be
per
se
violation,
your
honor.
regardless
of
purpose
or
effect
as
your
honor
said
in
pennington.
this
must
be
a
per
se
violation.
the
employers
in
the
dominant
units
got
no
right
to
tell
the
union
what
it
can
do
in
the
other
units.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
your
honor
says
that
such
an
agreement
that
is
an
agreement
to
apply
certain
wage
to
terms
in
other
units
violates
antitrust
policy
regardless
of
purpose
or
effect
and
we
say
that
should
be
the
law.
it’s
got
to
be
the
law.
the
dominant
units
can’t
tell
the
union
how
to
conduct
itself
in
these
other
bargaining
units
and
we
say
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that
the
law
cannot
allow
the
dominant
unit
to
keep
all
the
other
bargaining
units
under
the
same
terms
for
the
duration
of
the
understandings
between
the
dominant
unit
and
the
union.
in
other
words,
this
national
contract
still
goes
on
today
and
if
the
other
units
can’t
change
their
terms
during
the
continuation
of
the
national
contract,
we
never
will
have
any
competition
in
this
industry,
it’s
practically
going
today.
