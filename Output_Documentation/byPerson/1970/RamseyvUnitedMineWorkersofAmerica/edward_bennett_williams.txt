mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
the
case
at
bar
have
taken
the
teaching
of
pennington
against
the
mine
workers
decided
by
this
court
in
1965
and
they
have
made
it
the
predicate
for
two
contentions
which
they
have
asserted
throughout
the
life
of
this
litigation.
the
teaching
on
which
they
rely
is
that
where
a
union
enters
into
a
contract
with
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
for
a
wage
scale
and
then
agrees
to
impose
that
wage
scale
on
the
risk
of
the
industry
that
the
union
loses
its
antitrust
exemption.
now,
they
make
two
contentions,
if
the
court
please,
based
upon
that
teaching.
they
say
first
of
all,
that
when
the
respondent
union
entered
in
to
its
contract
with
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association
in
1958
and
specifically
entered
into
what
is
called
the
protective
wage
clause
that
they
lost
their
antitrust
exemption.
secondly,
they
say,
even
if
the
protective
wage
clause
doesn’t
mean
what
we
say
it
means
and
what
nine-judges
found
below
it
did
not
mean.
even
so,
say
they
in
the
disjunctive
notwithstanding
that
there
was
a
clandestine,
surreptitious,
under
the
table
tacit
agreement
between
the
respondent
union
and
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association
whereby
the
respondent
union
agreed
to
do
just
that
namely
impose
the
national
wage
scale
on
the
whole
coal
industry.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
the
attention
of
the
court
first
of
all
to
the
first
contention
namely
the
contention
that
petitioners
make
with
respect
to
the
protective
wage
clause
of
the
1958
agreement.
the
trial
court
found
and
all
eight
judges
of
the
sixth
circuit
found
notwithstanding
there
four
to
four
split
on
other
issues
that
the
protective
wage
clause
meant
no
such
thing
as
petitioners
contend
for.
the
judges
below
found
that
all
the
protective
wage
clause
did
in
the
1958
agreement
was
to
bind
the
respondent
union
not
to
enter
into
any
more
favorable
side
deal
with
the
signatories
to
that
contract
and
that
it
never
had,
nor
was
it
ever
intended
to
have
application
to
any
members
of
the
industry
who
were
not
signatories
thereto.
the
sixth
circuit
said
this,
plaintiff
sought
to
persuade
the
district
court
and
now
seeks
to
persuade
us
that
this
language
namely
paragraph
“a”
taken
in
the
historic
context
of
the
bargaining
relationship
constitutes
and
express
undertaking
by
defendant
to
impose
the
bcoa
umw
wage
scale
on
all
non-signatory
coal
operators.
we
simply
do
not
find
language
to
support
this
contention.
the
italicize
portions,
the
disputed
agreement
clearly
indicate
that
it
is
expressly
limited
in
its
effect
to
the
signatories
thereto.
that
was
the
finding
of
all
judges
in
the
courts
below
and
if
the
court
please
it
has
been
the
finding
of
every
court
which
has
had
occasion
to
pass
upon
the
meaning
of
this
language
and
indeed
it
is
the
only
reasonable
conclusion
that
any
court
could
come
to
from
reading
paragraph
“a”
which
is
set
out
at
page
15
of
our
brief
--
the
respondent’s
brief
because
it
clearly
applies
to
employees
who
are
covered
by
the
contract.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
that
--
if
what
petitioners
contend
for
mr.
justice
white
were
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
were
correct.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
their
meaning,
if
what
they
say
paragraph
“a”
means
is
correct
then
under
pennington,
the
union
would
have
lost
its
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly,
under
my
reading
of
the
clause
and
under
the
reading
of
the
clause
of
all
judges
below,
the
union
would
not
have
sacrificed
its
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir,
i'm
saying
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh,
yes,
because
the
fact
that
it
is
no
longer
exempt
under
the
antitrust
law
as
i
read
pennington
does
not
make
the
act
which
rendered
it
non-exempt
a
per
se
violation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
now,
the
down
side
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
is
that
well
failing
in
that
contention
as
all
courts
have
found
we
did.
nonetheless,
there
was
tacit
agreement
not
expressed
in
writing,
a
tacit
under
the
table
agreement
between
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association
and
the
respondent
union
that
the
union
would
in
fact
impose
the
terms
of
that
national
agreement
on
the
non-signatory
members
of
the
industry.
now,
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
such
a
tacit
agreement.
the
petitioners
contend
that
the
trial
court
applied
the
wrong
standard
of
proof
in
arriving
at
that
finding.
and
so,
it
becomes
necessary
for
us
to
see
what
instructions
the
trial-judge
gave
himself
in
this
non-jury
case
in
arriving
at
the
finding
that
no
such
clandestine
conspiracy
existed
between
the
mine
workers
and
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association.
we
contend,
if
the
court
please
that
section
6
means
this,
it
means
that
when
a
union
is
a
defendant
in
a
case
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
or
when
an
employer
is
a
defendant
in
a
case
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
that
before
it
can
be
held
vicariously
liable
for
the
acts
of
its
agents
or
officers,
clear
proof
must
be
shown
that
it
authorize
such
acts
or
ratify
them
once
it
became
knowledgeable
concerning
them.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
recess,
i
was
saying
that
the
trial
judge
understood
clearly
what
section
6
meant
and
understood
clearly
what
the
burden
of
proof
was
in
this
case
and
i
was
about
to
explicate
on
that
by
showing
both
from
evidence
extrinsic
to
the
opinion
below
and
intrinsic
within
the
opinion
below,
we
can
see
that
the
trial
judge
knew
precisely
what
the
rule
of
law
was
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof.
within
just
a
number
of
weeks
after
this
case
was
tried
before
the
trial
judge
without
a
jury,
the
same
trial
judge
tried
a
case
involving
the
same
issues,
factually
and
legally
with
the
jury.
that
case
is
reported
at
416
f.
2d
at
page
1192
tennessee
consolidated
coal
company
against
the
mine
workers.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
416
f.
2d,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
1192,
yes,
i
did
mr.
justice
stewart.
now,
in
that
case,
there
is
said
out
in
haec
verba
the
instructions
that
judge
wilson
gave
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
section
6
norris-laguardia
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
case
of
this
kind
and
those
instructions
appeared
at
pages
22
to
24
in
our
brief,
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
and
there
it
is
laid
out
with
absolute
clarity
what
the
burdens
--
the
respect
of
burdens
of
the
plaintiff
are
he
says
there
is
one
issue
in
this
case
upon
which
the
plaintiffs
have
a
heavier
burden
of
proof
than
i
have
just
described
that
is
whether
the
defendant
actually
participated
in
are
authorized
or
ratified
actions
which
violated
the
sherman
act.
labor,
he
says
on
every
other
issue
in
this
case,
on
every
other
on
the
case,
the
plaintiffs
are
required
merely
to
preponderate,
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
their
contentions
are
correct.
he
says,
labor
organizations
are
relieved
under
the
law
from
liability
for
damages
or
imputation
of
guilt
or
lowest
acts
done
in
labor
disputes
by
officers
or
agents
unless
there
is
clear
prove
that
the
organization
charged
with
the
responsibility
participated
in,
gave
authorization
for
or
read
applied
such
acts
after
they
became
knowledgeable
with
respect
to
the
acts.
in
other
words,
the
trial
judge
showed
there
that
he
understood
precisely
what
the
law
was
at
that
time.
now,
what
do
the
petitioners
say
with
respect
to
that?
they
say
in
their
reply
brief
to
our
brief
at
page
10
that
the
judge
changed
his
mind
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
that
after
extensive
argument,
he
became
convinced
that
he
was
wrong.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i’m
now
at
page
10
of
the
petitioner’s
reply
to
the
brief
of
respondent,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
say
that
he
changed
his
views
and
they
say
that,
if
the
court
please,
with
no
record
reference
and
indeed
no
record
support
or
if
they
were
right
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
the
trial-judge
had
undergone
a
change
of
mind
with
respect
to
what
the
true
burden
of
proof
was,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
case
neither
would
have
been
nor
shouldn’t
have
been
here
because
the
remedy
was
easily
available
to
the
petitioners
to
ask
for
a
remand
from
the
sixth
circuit
of
this
case
back
to
the
trial
court
for
purposes
of
filing
a
motion
under
rule
60
(b)
to
correct
the
judgment
upon
error
of
law.
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
petitioners
would
have
done
if
the
trial
judge
had
changed
his
mind
with
respect
to
the
burden.
but
indeed,
they
did
not
do
that
and
indeed
they
could
not
do
that
because
the
record
shows
the
transcript
of
record
shows
in
tennessee
consolidated
v.
the
united
mine
workers
and
that
this
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
it
as
a
record
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
changed
his
mind
at
all,
that
in
fact
there
was
no
extensive
argument
to
persuade
him
to
a
different
point
of
view
and
at
pages
30
to
54
of
that
transcript
of
record,
the
trial
judge
announced
that
he
would
instruct
the
jury
in
all
respects
on
the
law
as
he
had
found
the
law
in
ramsey.
now,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it’s
my
--
no,
it’s
my
view,
if
the
court
please,
that
section
6
applies
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
union
is
liable
for
any
allegedly
illicit
acts
or
agreements.
in
order
for
a
union
to
act
or
in
order
for
a
union
to
agree,
it
is
necessary
that
it
act
vicariously
through
its
officers
or
its
agents
on
every
issue
of
vicarious
liability
norris-laguardia
requires
that
there
be
clear
proof
that
the
union
either
authorize
such
conduct
or
that
it
ratified
it
after
it
became
knowledgeable
concerning
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
it’s
no
different
mr.
chief
justice
because
section
6
applies
both
to
employers
--
employer
organizations
and
labor
organizations
in
labor
disputes
only
in
labor
disputes
and
that’s
our
contention
here
that
there
was
a
charge,
it
was
charged
the
union
entered
into
an
illicit
clandestine
agreement.
now,
it
would
have
to
do
so
vicariously
through
the
acts
of
its
officers
or
agents
and
there
was
no
showing
within
the
meaning
of
section
6
that
there
was
clear
proof
that
any
such
conduct
was
authorized
or
ratified.
now,
what
did
the
petitioners
do
in
lieu
of
the
course
that
i
have
just
suggested,
they
would
if
followed
if
they
were
right
about
what
judge
wilson
held
on
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case.
they
went
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
seized
upon
a
couple
of
sentences
in
a
52-page
opinion
and
they
sought
to
convince
the
court
of
appeals
that
judge
wilson
had
misunderstood
the
law
on
burden
of
proof.
let’s
look
at
a
sentence
that
they
have
seized
upon
as
illustrating
so
they
contend
that
judge
wilson
did
not
understand
the
appropriate
burden.
they
say
--
judge
wilson
said,
having
concluded
that
the
protective
wage
clause
does
not
constitute
and
express
commitment
upon
the
part
of
umw
to
the
bcoa
not
to
bargain
with
any
other
coal
operator
upon
any
terms
other
than
the
national
contract.
this
does
not
conclude
the
issue
of
whether
the
umw
did
in
fact
do
not
expressly
so
contract.
where
this
case
being
tried
upon
the
usual
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rule?
the
court
would
conclude
the
umw
did
so
impliedly
agree.
however,
the
standard
of
proof
where
a
labor
union
involved
is
clear
proof
as
required
by
section
6
--
a
standard
different
from
the
ordinary
burden
of
persuasion.
the
trial
judge
was
there
saying
since
a
labor
union
is
the
defendant,
since
the
contention
is
that
the
labor
union
entered
into
an
illicit
agreement
and
since
the
union
can
enter
in
to
such
an
agreement
only
vicariously
through
its
agents
or
officers
or
members,
then
of
course
the
standard
of
proof
is
clear.
and
it
must
be
that
the
petitioners
must
carry
the
day
by
a
clear
standard
of
proof
to
show
that
the
mine
workers
union
did
in
fact
ratify
or
authorize
such
conduct.
again,
they
seized
upon
some
language,
did
not
the
clear
evidence
rule
apply.
the
court
might
have
reach
to
different
conclusion
upon
certain
issues.
the
other
issue
upon
which
the
court
might
have
reached
the
different
conclusion
is
the
issue
concerning
violence
in
the
coal
fields.
this
court
said
in
gibbs
against
the
mine
workers
in
1966
that
the
clear
proof
standard
applied
when
there
was
an
effort
by
a
plaintiff
to
impute
responsibility
for
violent
acts
to
the
apparent
union
because
section
6
applies
so
that
all
of
the
language
of
the
trial
judges
entirely
consonant
with
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
section
6.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
52-page
opinion
that
is
at
war
with
the
appropriate
and
proper
standard
of
proof
as
delineated
in
section
6
of
norris-laguardia.
in
fact,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
judge
wilson’s
instructions
in
tennessee
consolidated
coal
against
the
mine
workers
and
in
his
holding
ramsey
against
the
mine
workers
stand
out
like
a
beacon
on
the
fog
of
confusion
with
respect
to
this
issue
on
burden
of
proof.
now,
i
said
earlier
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
your
honor
that
there
was
a
very,
very
serious
lack
of
clarity
with
respect
to
the
positions
that
were
asserted
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
that’s
what
i
say
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
trial-judge’s
opinion
is
entirely
accurate
here.
it
was
entirely
accurate
in
the
case
at
bar
and
entirely
accurate
in
the
case
that
immediately
followed
it
and
it
demonstrates
that
he
understood
the
burden
of
proof
entirely
correct.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that’s
correct
your
honor.
now,
let’s
look
at
the
opinion
of
judge
--
let’s
look
at
the
opinion
of
judge
wilson
in
the
court
below.
the
petitioners
made
four
subsidiary
allegations.
they
made
four
subsidiary
allegations
to
prove
circumstantially
that
there
was
an
illicit
conspiracy.
they
say
first
of
all
that
petitioners
insistent
upon
a
national
uniform
wage
policy
began
in
1950
and
this
is
a
basis
for
inferring
the
incipiency
of
a
conspiracy
with
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association.
the
trial
judge
found
“no
evidence”
of
this,
he
found
affirmatively
“that
it
was
clear
from
all
the
evidence”
the
national
uniformity
in
wage
policy
of
the
respondent
union
began
in
1890
and
that
it
was
no
basis
for
an
inference
that
there
was
an
illicit
conspiracy
began
in
1950.
they
say
secondly,
that
the
tranquility
and
the
serenity
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
post
1950
period
in
the
coal
industry
is
a
basis
for
inferring
that
there
was
conspiratorial
relationship
between
the
respondent
union
and
the
mine
workers
when
that
is
just
oppose
to
the
turbulence
and
turmoil
of
the
pre-1950
period.
in
here,
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding
i
think
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
case.
he
said
that
the
united
mine
workers
negotiated
the
1950
whole
wage
agreement
with
spokesman
for
the
major
coal
producers
in
the
nation
and
then
has
uniformly
sought
to
impose
the
same
agreement
upon
all
the
rest
of
the
industry
might
reasonably
lead
to
the
inference
of
the
mine
workers
had
agreed
with
the
major
operators
that
it
would
impose
the
national
agreement
upon
the
rest
to
the
industry,
and
equally
reasonable
inference
is
that
the
union
was
but
following
the
pattern
of
industry
wide
bargaining
established
since
prior
to
the
turn
of
the
century
in
electing
to
negotiate
with
the
agreement
with
spokesman
of
the
major
coal
producers
and
was
but
following
its
historic
policy
of
national
uniformity
of
labor
standards
in
seeking
to
impose
the
national
agreement
upon
the
rest
of
the
industry.
again,
they
contend
that
there
was
predatory
pricing
in
the
tva
market
on
the
part
of
two
coal
companies
in
which
the
respondent
union
had
an
interest
--
a
financial
interest.
the
trial
judge
in
an
exhausted
analysis
of
the
pricing
history
in
the
tva
market
over
a
period
of
years
found
not
only
was
there
no
predatory
pricing
by
the
two
companies
at
which
the
union
had
an
interest,
but
that
at
all
times
the
two
companies
were
merely
attempting
to
meet
competition
rather
than
to
lead
the
market
downward.
but
each
of
these
subsidiary
issues,
the
trial
judge
was
applying
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
and
he
was
finding
that
petitioners,
the
plaintiffs
below
had
failed
to
satisfy
this
standard
or
proof.
finally,
if
the
court
please
there
was
a
charged
that
there
was
turbulence
and
turmoil
in
the
southeastern
tennessee
coal
fields
during
the
relevant
period
that
there
was
violence
and
that
this
was
ascribable
to
the
mine
workers.
in
this
instance,
once
again
a
trial
judge
made
this
finding,
he
said
that
the
united
mine
workers
activities
in
recent
years
in
the
southeastern
tennessee
coal
field
can
be
explained
equally
as
well
as
being
unilateral
action
in
pursuing
its
own
interest
and
policies
as
they
can
be
explained
by
inferring
that
the
umw
was
acting
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
violence,
it
was
the
same
violence
that
was
averred
before
this
court
in
gibbs
against
the
mine
workers
of
1966
and
he
applied
the
standard
of
proof
mandated
by
this
court
in
that
case
and
found
that
there
was
no
evidence,
whatsoever
they
support
an
inference
that
the
respondent
union
was
responsible
for
it
and
in
that
instance,
the
clear
proof
standard
applied.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
there
were
two
issues
clearly,
mr.
chief
justice
in
which
the
clear
standard
of
proof
applied.
one
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
mine
workers
union
was
responsible
for
violence
which
was
averred
in
1960
and
in
1962
in
the
southeastern
tennessee
coal
fields.
the
trial
judge
said
the
clear
standard
of
proof
applies
here
because
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
is
applicable.
and
where
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
is
applicable
then
i
have
to
apply
standard
of
clear
proof.
he
also
said,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
at
one
point
he
were
deciding
whether
the
union
was
responsible
for
any
agreement
that
might
have
been
made
although
he
never
found
that
such
an
agreement
was
made
if
he
were
to
decide
that
the
union
was
responsible
for
any
illicit
antitrust
agreement
made
with
the
bcoa,
he
would
have
to
apply
the
clear
standard
of
proof
because
once
again
for
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
would
be
applicable.
and
where
that
is
applicable
before
a
union
or
an
employer
can
be
held
in
a
labor
dispute,
congress
has
mandated
under
section
6
that
clear
proof
is
necessary
on
that
issue.
so
there
were
two
issues
clearly
before
us
where
that
doctrine
was
applicable
and
i
suggest
that
he
found
that
entirely
properly
and
then
all
other
issues
he
applied
the
appropriate
standard
namely
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
and
an
analysis
of
his
findings
beginning
at
--
i
believe
at
pages
of
149
to
158-a
of
volume
1
of
the
record
which
is
his
opinion
and
which
is
the
overview
of
all
the
facts
shows
that
he
clearly
understood
what
the
burdens
were
another
--
the
petitioners
criticized
us
and
chastised
us
for
departmentalizing
and
dismembering
and
fragmenting
and
parsing
these
opinions
saying
you
have
to
take
the
overview.
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
panorama
effects.
this
is
what
the
trial
judge
said
on
that.
there
remains
to
be
accomplished
in
evaluation
of
the
full
record
upon
the
trial
of
this
case
when
viewed
as
whole
rather
than
when
viewed
in
segments
as
has
thus
far
been
necessary.
having
taken
a
look
at
the
individual
figures
one
by
one,
it’s
now
the
duty
of
the
court
to
look
at
the
panorama
and
this
was
he
says
he
looks
at
the
panorama,
while
many
inferences
favorable
to
the
plaintiff’s
contentions
can
reasonably
be
drown
from
the
evidence.
in
every
instance,
a
no
less
equally
reasonable
inference
can
be
drawn
to
the
contrary.
in
other
words,
at
best
he
found
the
evidence
in
equipoise
which
does
not
even
satisfy
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
so
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
judge
was
reached
entirely
in
accord
with
the
appropriate
standards
of
proof
and
that
it
should
be
affirmed
for
that
reason.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
the
case
at
bar
have
taken
the
teaching
of
pennington
against
the
mine
workers
decided
by
this
court
in
1965
and
they
have
made
it
the
predicate
for
two
contentions
which
they
have
asserted
throughout
the
life
of
this
litigation.
the
teaching
on
which
they
rely
is
that
where
a
union
enters
into
a
contract
with
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
for
a
wage
scale
and
then
agrees
to
impose
that
wage
scale
on
the
risk
of
the
industry
that
the
union
loses
its
antitrust
exemption.
now,
they
make
two
contentions,
if
the
court
please,
based
upon
that
teaching.
they
say
first
of
all,
that
when
the
respondent
union
entered
in
to
its
contract
with
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association
in
1958
and
specifically
entered
into
what
is
called
the
protective
wage
clause
that
they
lost
their
antitrust
exemption.
secondly,
they
say,
even
if
the
protective
wage
clause
doesn’t
mean
what
we
say
it
means
and
what
nine-judges
found
below
it
did
not
mean.
even
so,
say
they
in
the
disjunctive
notwithstanding
that
there
was
a
clandestine,
surreptitious,
under
the
table
tacit
agreement
between
the
respondent
union
and
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association
whereby
the
respondent
union
agreed
to
do
just
that
namely
impose
the
national
wage
scale
on
the
whole
coal
industry.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
the
attention
of
the
court
first
of
all
to
the
first
contention
namely
the
contention
that
petitioners
make
with
respect
to
the
protective
wage
clause
of
the
1958
agreement.
the
trial
court
found
and
all
eight
judges
of
the
sixth
circuit
found
notwithstanding
there
four
to
four
split
on
other
issues
that
the
protective
wage
clause
meant
no
such
thing
as
petitioners
contend
for.
the
judges
below
found
that
all
the
protective
wage
clause
did
in
the
1958
agreement
was
to
bind
the
respondent
union
not
to
enter
into
any
more
favorable
side
deal
with
the
signatories
to
that
contract
and
that
it
never
had,
nor
was
it
ever
intended
to
have
application
to
any
members
of
the
industry
who
were
not
signatories
thereto.
the
sixth
circuit
said
this,
plaintiff
sought
to
persuade
the
district
court
and
now
seeks
to
persuade
us
that
this
language
namely
paragraph
“a”
taken
in
the
historic
context
of
the
bargaining
relationship
constitutes
and
express
undertaking
by
defendant
to
impose
the
bcoa
umw
wage
scale
on
all
non-signatory
coal
operators.
we
simply
do
not
find
language
to
support
this
contention.
the
italicize
portions,
the
disputed
agreement
clearly
indicate
that
it
is
expressly
limited
in
its
effect
to
the
signatories
thereto.
that
was
the
finding
of
all
judges
in
the
courts
below
and
if
the
court
please
it
has
been
the
finding
of
every
court
which
has
had
occasion
to
pass
upon
the
meaning
of
this
language
and
indeed
it
is
the
only
reasonable
conclusion
that
any
court
could
come
to
from
reading
paragraph
“a”
which
is
set
out
at
page
15
of
our
brief
--
the
respondent’s
brief
because
it
clearly
applies
to
employees
who
are
covered
by
the
contract.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
that
--
if
what
petitioners
contend
for
mr.
justice
white
were
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
were
correct.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
their
meaning,
if
what
they
say
paragraph
“a”
means
is
correct
then
under
pennington,
the
union
would
have
lost
its
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly,
under
my
reading
of
the
clause
and
under
the
reading
of
the
clause
of
all
judges
below,
the
union
would
not
have
sacrificed
its
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
sir,
i'm
saying
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh,
yes,
because
the
fact
that
it
is
no
longer
exempt
under
the
antitrust
law
as
i
read
pennington
does
not
make
the
act
which
rendered
it
non-exempt
a
per
se
violation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
now,
the
down
side
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
is
that
well
failing
in
that
contention
as
all
courts
have
found
we
did.
nonetheless,
there
was
tacit
agreement
not
expressed
in
writing,
a
tacit
under
the
table
agreement
between
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association
and
the
respondent
union
that
the
union
would
in
fact
impose
the
terms
of
that
national
agreement
on
the
non-signatory
members
of
the
industry.
now,
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
such
a
tacit
agreement.
the
petitioners
contend
that
the
trial
court
applied
the
wrong
standard
of
proof
in
arriving
at
that
finding.
and
so,
it
becomes
necessary
for
us
to
see
what
instructions
the
trial-judge
gave
himself
in
this
non-jury
case
in
arriving
at
the
finding
that
no
such
clandestine
conspiracy
existed
between
the
mine
workers
and
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association.
we
contend,
if
the
court
please
that
section
6
means
this,
it
means
that
when
a
union
is
a
defendant
in
a
case
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
or
when
an
employer
is
a
defendant
in
a
case
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
that
before
it
can
be
held
vicariously
liable
for
the
acts
of
its
agents
or
officers,
clear
proof
must
be
shown
that
it
authorize
such
acts
or
ratify
them
once
it
became
knowledgeable
concerning
them.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
recess,
i
was
saying
that
the
trial
judge
understood
clearly
what
section
6
meant
and
understood
clearly
what
the
burden
of
proof
was
in
this
case
and
i
was
about
to
explicate
on
that
by
showing
both
from
evidence
extrinsic
to
the
opinion
below
and
intrinsic
within
the
opinion
below,
we
can
see
that
the
trial
judge
knew
precisely
what
the
rule
of
law
was
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof.
within
just
a
number
of
weeks
after
this
case
was
tried
before
the
trial
judge
without
a
jury,
the
same
trial
judge
tried
a
case
involving
the
same
issues,
factually
and
legally
with
the
jury.
that
case
is
reported
at
416
f.
2d
at
page
1192
tennessee
consolidated
coal
company
against
the
mine
workers.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
416
f.
2d,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
1192,
yes,
i
did
mr.
justice
stewart.
now,
in
that
case,
there
is
said
out
in
haec
verba
the
instructions
that
judge
wilson
gave
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
section
6
norris-laguardia
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
case
of
this
kind
and
those
instructions
appeared
at
pages
22
to
24
in
our
brief,
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
and
there
it
is
laid
out
with
absolute
clarity
what
the
burdens
--
the
respect
of
burdens
of
the
plaintiff
are
he
says
there
is
one
issue
in
this
case
upon
which
the
plaintiffs
have
a
heavier
burden
of
proof
than
i
have
just
described
that
is
whether
the
defendant
actually
participated
in
are
authorized
or
ratified
actions
which
violated
the
sherman
act.
labor,
he
says
on
every
other
issue
in
this
case,
on
every
other
on
the
case,
the
plaintiffs
are
required
merely
to
preponderate,
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
their
contentions
are
correct.
he
says,
labor
organizations
are
relieved
under
the
law
from
liability
for
damages
or
imputation
of
guilt
or
lowest
acts
done
in
labor
disputes
by
officers
or
agents
unless
there
is
clear
prove
that
the
organization
charged
with
the
responsibility
participated
in,
gave
authorization
for
or
read
applied
such
acts
after
they
became
knowledgeable
with
respect
to
the
acts.
in
other
words,
the
trial
judge
showed
there
that
he
understood
precisely
what
the
law
was
at
that
time.
now,
what
do
the
petitioners
say
with
respect
to
that?
they
say
in
their
reply
brief
to
our
brief
at
page
10
that
the
judge
changed
his
mind
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
that
after
extensive
argument,
he
became
convinced
that
he
was
wrong.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i’m
now
at
page
10
of
the
petitioner’s
reply
to
the
brief
of
respondent,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
say
that
he
changed
his
views
and
they
say
that,
if
the
court
please,
with
no
record
reference
and
indeed
no
record
support
or
if
they
were
right
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
the
trial-judge
had
undergone
a
change
of
mind
with
respect
to
what
the
true
burden
of
proof
was,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
case
neither
would
have
been
nor
shouldn’t
have
been
here
because
the
remedy
was
easily
available
to
the
petitioners
to
ask
for
a
remand
from
the
sixth
circuit
of
this
case
back
to
the
trial
court
for
purposes
of
filing
a
motion
under
rule
60
(b)
to
correct
the
judgment
upon
error
of
law.
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
petitioners
would
have
done
if
the
trial
judge
had
changed
his
mind
with
respect
to
the
burden.
but
indeed,
they
did
not
do
that
and
indeed
they
could
not
do
that
because
the
record
shows
the
transcript
of
record
shows
in
tennessee
consolidated
v.
the
united
mine
workers
and
that
this
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
it
as
a
record
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
changed
his
mind
at
all,
that
in
fact
there
was
no
extensive
argument
to
persuade
him
to
a
different
point
of
view
and
at
pages
30
to
54
of
that
transcript
of
record,
the
trial
judge
announced
that
he
would
instruct
the
jury
in
all
respects
on
the
law
as
he
had
found
the
law
in
ramsey.
now,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it’s
my
--
no,
it’s
my
view,
if
the
court
please,
that
section
6
applies
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
union
is
liable
for
any
allegedly
illicit
acts
or
agreements.
in
order
for
a
union
to
act
or
in
order
for
a
union
to
agree,
it
is
necessary
that
it
act
vicariously
through
its
officers
or
its
agents
on
every
issue
of
vicarious
liability
norris-laguardia
requires
that
there
be
clear
proof
that
the
union
either
authorize
such
conduct
or
that
it
ratified
it
after
it
became
knowledgeable
concerning
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
it’s
no
different
mr.
chief
justice
because
section
6
applies
both
to
employers
--
employer
organizations
and
labor
organizations
in
labor
disputes
only
in
labor
disputes
and
that’s
our
contention
here
that
there
was
a
charge,
it
was
charged
the
union
entered
into
an
illicit
clandestine
agreement.
now,
it
would
have
to
do
so
vicariously
through
the
acts
of
its
officers
or
agents
and
there
was
no
showing
within
the
meaning
of
section
6
that
there
was
clear
proof
that
any
such
conduct
was
authorized
or
ratified.
now,
what
did
the
petitioners
do
in
lieu
of
the
course
that
i
have
just
suggested,
they
would
if
followed
if
they
were
right
about
what
judge
wilson
held
on
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case.
they
went
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
seized
upon
a
couple
of
sentences
in
a
52-page
opinion
and
they
sought
to
convince
the
court
of
appeals
that
judge
wilson
had
misunderstood
the
law
on
burden
of
proof.
let’s
look
at
a
sentence
that
they
have
seized
upon
as
illustrating
so
they
contend
that
judge
wilson
did
not
understand
the
appropriate
burden.
they
say
--
judge
wilson
said,
having
concluded
that
the
protective
wage
clause
does
not
constitute
and
express
commitment
upon
the
part
of
umw
to
the
bcoa
not
to
bargain
with
any
other
coal
operator
upon
any
terms
other
than
the
national
contract.
this
does
not
conclude
the
issue
of
whether
the
umw
did
in
fact
do
not
expressly
so
contract.
where
this
case
being
tried
upon
the
usual
preponderance
of
the
evidence
rule?
the
court
would
conclude
the
umw
did
so
impliedly
agree.
however,
the
standard
of
proof
where
a
labor
union
involved
is
clear
proof
as
required
by
section
6
--
a
standard
different
from
the
ordinary
burden
of
persuasion.
the
trial
judge
was
there
saying
since
a
labor
union
is
the
defendant,
since
the
contention
is
that
the
labor
union
entered
into
an
illicit
agreement
and
since
the
union
can
enter
in
to
such
an
agreement
only
vicariously
through
its
agents
or
officers
or
members,
then
of
course
the
standard
of
proof
is
clear.
and
it
must
be
that
the
petitioners
must
carry
the
day
by
a
clear
standard
of
proof
to
show
that
the
mine
workers
union
did
in
fact
ratify
or
authorize
such
conduct.
again,
they
seized
upon
some
language,
did
not
the
clear
evidence
rule
apply.
the
court
might
have
reach
to
different
conclusion
upon
certain
issues.
the
other
issue
upon
which
the
court
might
have
reached
the
different
conclusion
is
the
issue
concerning
violence
in
the
coal
fields.
this
court
said
in
gibbs
against
the
mine
workers
in
1966
that
the
clear
proof
standard
applied
when
there
was
an
effort
by
a
plaintiff
to
impute
responsibility
for
violent
acts
to
the
apparent
union
because
section
6
applies
so
that
all
of
the
language
of
the
trial
judges
entirely
consonant
with
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
section
6.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
52-page
opinion
that
is
at
war
with
the
appropriate
and
proper
standard
of
proof
as
delineated
in
section
6
of
norris-laguardia.
in
fact,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
judge
wilson’s
instructions
in
tennessee
consolidated
coal
against
the
mine
workers
and
in
his
holding
ramsey
against
the
mine
workers
stand
out
like
a
beacon
on
the
fog
of
confusion
with
respect
to
this
issue
on
burden
of
proof.
now,
i
said
earlier
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
your
honor
that
there
was
a
very,
very
serious
lack
of
clarity
with
respect
to
the
positions
that
were
asserted
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
that’s
what
i
say
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
trial-judge’s
opinion
is
entirely
accurate
here.
it
was
entirely
accurate
in
the
case
at
bar
and
entirely
accurate
in
the
case
that
immediately
followed
it
and
it
demonstrates
that
he
understood
the
burden
of
proof
entirely
correct.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that’s
correct
your
honor.
now,
let’s
look
at
the
opinion
of
judge
--
let’s
look
at
the
opinion
of
judge
wilson
in
the
court
below.
the
petitioners
made
four
subsidiary
allegations.
they
made
four
subsidiary
allegations
to
prove
circumstantially
that
there
was
an
illicit
conspiracy.
they
say
first
of
all
that
petitioners
insistent
upon
a
national
uniform
wage
policy
began
in
1950
and
this
is
a
basis
for
inferring
the
incipiency
of
a
conspiracy
with
the
bituminous
coal
owners
association.
the
trial
judge
found
“no
evidence”
of
this,
he
found
affirmatively
“that
it
was
clear
from
all
the
evidence”
the
national
uniformity
in
wage
policy
of
the
respondent
union
began
in
1890
and
that
it
was
no
basis
for
an
inference
that
there
was
an
illicit
conspiracy
began
in
1950.
they
say
secondly,
that
the
tranquility
and
the
serenity
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
post
1950
period
in
the
coal
industry
is
a
basis
for
inferring
that
there
was
conspiratorial
relationship
between
the
respondent
union
and
the
mine
workers
when
that
is
just
oppose
to
the
turbulence
and
turmoil
of
the
pre-1950
period.
in
here,
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding
i
think
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
case.
he
said
that
the
united
mine
workers
negotiated
the
1950
whole
wage
agreement
with
spokesman
for
the
major
coal
producers
in
the
nation
and
then
has
uniformly
sought
to
impose
the
same
agreement
upon
all
the
rest
of
the
industry
might
reasonably
lead
to
the
inference
of
the
mine
workers
had
agreed
with
the
major
operators
that
it
would
impose
the
national
agreement
upon
the
rest
to
the
industry,
and
equally
reasonable
inference
is
that
the
union
was
but
following
the
pattern
of
industry
wide
bargaining
established
since
prior
to
the
turn
of
the
century
in
electing
to
negotiate
with
the
agreement
with
spokesman
of
the
major
coal
producers
and
was
but
following
its
historic
policy
of
national
uniformity
of
labor
standards
in
seeking
to
impose
the
national
agreement
upon
the
rest
of
the
industry.
again,
they
contend
that
there
was
predatory
pricing
in
the
tva
market
on
the
part
of
two
coal
companies
in
which
the
respondent
union
had
an
interest
--
a
financial
interest.
the
trial
judge
in
an
exhausted
analysis
of
the
pricing
history
in
the
tva
market
over
a
period
of
years
found
not
only
was
there
no
predatory
pricing
by
the
two
companies
at
which
the
union
had
an
interest,
but
that
at
all
times
the
two
companies
were
merely
attempting
to
meet
competition
rather
than
to
lead
the
market
downward.
but
each
of
these
subsidiary
issues,
the
trial
judge
was
applying
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
and
he
was
finding
that
petitioners,
the
plaintiffs
below
had
failed
to
satisfy
this
standard
or
proof.
finally,
if
the
court
please
there
was
a
charged
that
there
was
turbulence
and
turmoil
in
the
southeastern
tennessee
coal
fields
during
the
relevant
period
that
there
was
violence
and
that
this
was
ascribable
to
the
mine
workers.
in
this
instance,
once
again
a
trial
judge
made
this
finding,
he
said
that
the
united
mine
workers
activities
in
recent
years
in
the
southeastern
tennessee
coal
field
can
be
explained
equally
as
well
as
being
unilateral
action
in
pursuing
its
own
interest
and
policies
as
they
can
be
explained
by
inferring
that
the
umw
was
acting
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
violence,
it
was
the
same
violence
that
was
averred
before
this
court
in
gibbs
against
the
mine
workers
of
1966
and
he
applied
the
standard
of
proof
mandated
by
this
court
in
that
case
and
found
that
there
was
no
evidence,
whatsoever
they
support
an
inference
that
the
respondent
union
was
responsible
for
it
and
in
that
instance,
the
clear
proof
standard
applied.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
there
were
two
issues
clearly,
mr.
chief
justice
in
which
the
clear
standard
of
proof
applied.
one
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
mine
workers
union
was
responsible
for
violence
which
was
averred
in
1960
and
in
1962
in
the
southeastern
tennessee
coal
fields.
the
trial
judge
said
the
clear
standard
of
proof
applies
here
because
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
is
applicable.
and
where
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
is
applicable
then
i
have
to
apply
standard
of
clear
proof.
he
also
said,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
at
one
point
he
were
deciding
whether
the
union
was
responsible
for
any
agreement
that
might
have
been
made
although
he
never
found
that
such
an
agreement
was
made
if
he
were
to
decide
that
the
union
was
responsible
for
any
illicit
antitrust
agreement
made
with
the
bcoa,
he
would
have
to
apply
the
clear
standard
of
proof
because
once
again
for
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
would
be
applicable.
and
where
that
is
applicable
before
a
union
or
an
employer
can
be
held
in
a
labor
dispute,
congress
has
mandated
under
section
6
that
clear
proof
is
necessary
on
that
issue.
so
there
were
two
issues
clearly
before
us
where
that
doctrine
was
applicable
and
i
suggest
that
he
found
that
entirely
properly
and
then
all
other
issues
he
applied
the
appropriate
standard
namely
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
and
an
analysis
of
his
findings
beginning
at
--
i
believe
at
pages
of
149
to
158-a
of
volume
1
of
the
record
which
is
his
opinion
and
which
is
the
overview
of
all
the
facts
shows
that
he
clearly
understood
what
the
burdens
were
another
--
the
petitioners
criticized
us
and
chastised
us
for
departmentalizing
and
dismembering
and
fragmenting
and
parsing
these
opinions
saying
you
have
to
take
the
overview.
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
panorama
effects.
this
is
what
the
trial
judge
said
on
that.
there
remains
to
be
accomplished
in
evaluation
of
the
full
record
upon
the
trial
of
this
case
when
viewed
as
whole
rather
than
when
viewed
in
segments
as
has
thus
far
been
necessary.
having
taken
a
look
at
the
individual
figures
one
by
one,
it’s
now
the
duty
of
the
court
to
look
at
the
panorama
and
this
was
he
says
he
looks
at
the
panorama,
while
many
inferences
favorable
to
the
plaintiff’s
contentions
can
reasonably
be
drown
from
the
evidence.
in
every
instance,
a
no
less
equally
reasonable
inference
can
be
drawn
to
the
contrary.
in
other
words,
at
best
he
found
the
evidence
in
equipoise
which
does
not
even
satisfy
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
so
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
judge
was
reached
entirely
in
accord
with
the
appropriate
standards
of
proof
and
that
it
should
be
affirmed
for
that
reason.
