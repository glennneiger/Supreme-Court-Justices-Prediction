mr.
williams,
as
you
read
pennington
and
as
you
read
the
clause,
would
the
union
have
sacrifice
its
--
or
forfeit
its
antitrust
immunity,
if
that
meeting
of
the
clause
is
forever?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
contention?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
your
reading
of
the
clause
and
under
your
reading
of
pennington,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
the
union
has
not
sacrifice
its
antitrust.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
is
that
the
same
argument
as
saying
well,
it
may
have
sacrificed
its
immunity
but
it
has
to
violate
the
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
it
sacrifices
immunity,
you
still
have
a
job
proving
the
unions
violating
the
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
assessment?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
your
position
that
if
the
protective
wage
clause
is
construed
to
require
the
union
to
impose
the
wage
standards
on
outsiders
that
the
plaintiff
has
made
out
a
violation
to
the
antitrust
laws
or
only
that
the
union’s
exemption
is
forfeited?
