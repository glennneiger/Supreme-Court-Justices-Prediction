justice
potter
stewart
was
this
theory
that
as
illustrated
by
the
marion
county
situation,
multi-
member
districts
where
the
court
concluded
were
constitutionally
invalid,
and
that
is
what
led
it
to
reapportioning
entire
state,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
began
by
seeing
the
effect
of
the
multi-member
marion
county
district,
the
effect
on
this
ghetto
area?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
led
it
to
the
conclusion,
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
multi-member
districts
generally
were
constitutionally
invalid,
and
that
in
turn
led
it
to
look
to
the
rest
of
the
state
and
it
found
that
in
lake
county
and
elsewhere
there
were
multi-member
districts,
and
that
is
what
led
it
to
state-wide
reapportionment.
wasn't
that
[voice
overlap]
reasoning
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
marion
county
and
in
lake
county?
justice
potter
stewart
and
both
had
a
multi-member
districts
to
them?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
including
those
two
counties?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
manahan,
in
the
posture
that
this
case
now
presents
itself
to
us,
i
was
wondering
why
it
hadn't
become
moot?
the
1970
election
in
indiana
was
held
under
the
former
apportionment
of
the
system,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
like
you
just
told
us
that
in
the
early
next
year
there
is
going
to
be
and
will
be
a
reapportionment
based
on
the
1970
census?
justice
potter
stewart
as
we
know
general
elections
in
indiana
i
guess
till
--
until
that
has
become
effective,
so
this
thing
is
just
in
limbo,
and
has
no
applicability
to
any
elections,
has
it?
it
did
not
apply
to
the
1970
election,
it
will
not
apply
to
any
elections
after
early
next
year.
justice
potter
stewart
any
election,
so
why
isn't
this
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
court
didn't
need
to
state
that.
we
all
know
that
any
enforcement
has
to
conform
to
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
so
that
the
significance
of
this
this
three-judge
district
court
decision
is
that
if
it
is
affirmed
or
remains
undisturbed,
the
indiana
legislature
will
be
obligated
not
to
create
any
multi-member
districts.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
why
isn't
this
moot?
if
it
doesn't
even
have
that
much
of
effect,
why
isn't
it
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
this
court's
decision
is
that
if
this
case
has
become
moot,
the
consequence
would
be
as
i
remember
that
we
would
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
it
would
not
be
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
then
why
isn't
it
moot?
i
still
don't
understand
the
answer
to
my
question,
why
isn't
it
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
it
may
that
finding
only
in
connection
with
the
complaint
that
asked
for
relief
by
way
of
reapportionment
at
least
of
marion
county,
looking
toward
elections
that
have
now
taken
place.
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
isn't
it
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
well
no.
we
all
know
you
have
told
this
that
in
future
elections,
the
legislature
is
under
an
obligation,
next
month,
based
on
brand
new
figures,
the
1970
census
figures
to
reapportion
the
entire
state.
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
all
of
your
election.
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
distinguishes
it
from
a
minor
on
reapportionment
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
configures
that
have
now
may
become
obsolete
because
of
the
1970
census?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
late,
because
we
had
1970
census,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
claim
in
this
--
either
claim
or
finding
in
this
case
of
racial
discrimination
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
is
not
a
claim
or
much
let
alone
a
finding
of
racial
discrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
a
gomillion
against
lightfoot
kind
of
case,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
been
my
impression
that
in
the
absence
of
rational
discrimination
as
such,
our
cases
have
held
that
the
sort
of
considerations
that
entered
into
the
district
courts'
decision
were
not
only
--
not
required
by
the
constitution,
but
that
they
were
prohibited
by
the
constitution.
i
am
thinking
of
cases
such
as
carrington
against
rash
that
said
that
you
couldn't
regulate
the
franchise
depending
upon
your
prediction
as
to
how
people
are
going
to
vote.
i
am
thinking
about
wells
against
rockefeller
that
said
new
york
couldn't
constitutionally
try
to
justify
a
three
apportionment
scheme
by
showing
any
community
of
interest,
but
it
had
to
be
all
the
matter
of
mathematics.
am
i
mistaken
in
my
reading
of
those
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
like
to
ask
the
state
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice
his
views
on
this
question
of
mootness
of
this
case,
because
i
didn't
find
any
such
suggestion
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
going
to
another
election
under
that
act,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
with
or
without
this
court
order?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
on
different
facts
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
theory
that
as
illustrated
by
the
marion
county
situation,
multi-
member
districts
where
the
court

were

and
