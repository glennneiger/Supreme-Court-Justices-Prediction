mr.
james
manahan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
i
believe
have
to
recapitulate
what
did
occur
in
this
case
because
i
believe
some
confusion
has
resulted
from
the
presentation
which
has
been
made
by
the
appellate
as
to
what
took
place.
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court
by
residents
of
marion
county
and
lake
county
seeking
only
the
single
member
districting
of
marion
county,
indiana
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
prior
guidelines
in
fortson
v.
dorsey,
and
in
burns
v.
richardson.
mr.
james
manahan
in
marion
--
no,
plaintiffs
from
marion
and
lake
county,
but
seeking
only
the
single
member
districting
of
marion
county,
indiana.
the
plaintiff
from
lake
county
being
for
purposes
of
supporting
the
banzhaf
theory,
for
the
purpose
of
breaking
up
the
marion
county
district
only.
mr.
james
manahan
pardon
me?
mr.
james
manahan
indianapolis,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
gary
and
hammond,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
there
were
numerous
multi-member
districts
in
indiana
--
mr.
james
manahan
both
of
those
were
the
largest
two.
mr.
james
manahan
immediately
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
request
for
admissions
118
in
number
were
filed.
the
complaint
itself
with
the
69-page
document
which
is
set
forth
full
in
the
appendix
and
the
request
permissions
were
likewise
lengthy.
before
the
trial,
all
of
these
request
permissions
which
covered
every
aspect
of
the
complaint
were
admitted
and
at
the
trial,
the
admitted
requests
were
admitted
into
evidence
without
objection.
also
during
the
trial,
numerous
other
documents
from
the
state
library
were
available,
and
the
court
had
an
abundance
of
evidence
before
it,
all
of
which
was
admitted
and
was
un-contradicted
and
as
we
will
outline
did
present
a
full
case
under
fortson
v.
dorsey,
and
burns
v.
richardson
justifying
the
sub-districting
of
marion
county,
indiana,
but
something
else
took
place
before
the
trial
of
this
cause.
the
kirkpatrick
v.
preisler
decision
was
rendered,
and
with
the
result
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial
and
it
appears
at
the
page
133
of
the
appendix,
justice
turner,
the
presiding
judge
took
--
stated
that
the
court
was
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
indiana
is
malapportioned
and
thus
the
court
had
little
choice
what
to
do.
as
it
developed
that
the
state
of
indiana's
districts,
one
of
which
was
before
the
court,
or
at
that
time
malapportioned
so
bad
they
had
greater
divergences
of
population
that
even
the
dissenting
in
opinions,
in
kirkpatrick
v.
preisler
indicated
would
be
allowable.
mr.
james
manahan
completely
forgetting
the
single
multi-member
district
--
mr.
james
manahan
there
were
more
senators
from
marion
county
than
they
were
entitled
to
--
mr.
james
manahan
and
exactly
the
right
amount
of
representatives,
they
were
--
they
had
one
half
of
this
full
senate
too
much.
the
same
was
too
in
lake
county,
and
before
it
reached
its
findings,
the
district
court
and
the
tables
at
the
end
of
their
july
28
opinion
reflected
they
are
too
are
in
the
appendix
at
page
382
and
383,
the
divergences
between
districts
and
the
mal-apportionment
of
the
traditional
kind
involving
all
the
counties
of
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
the
normal
impact,
they
would
now
be
preparing
to
reapportion
as
they
are.
if
this
lawsuit
--
mr.
james
manahan
the
court's
stay
order
in
this
cause
has
now
made
the
state-wide
mal-apportionment
of
indiana,
no
longer
matter
of
consequence,
since
indiana
will
be
reapportioned
before
there
is
another
election.
mr.
james
manahan
yes.
mr.
james
manahan
to
begin
a
new
reapportionment?
they
were
not
scheduled
to
begin
a
new
reapportionment
until
this
coming
january,
next
month
and
they
were
scheduled
to
hold
an
election
as
they
did
in
the
meantime.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
there
was
only
more
election
to
be
held
before
there
would
be
a
reapportionment,
or
a
attempted
reapportionment
in
normal
course.
the
state
of
indiana
also
has
notable
record
for
having
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
for
its
legislators
to
agree
upon
apportionment.
in
this
case
they
gave
the
state
of
indiana
and
adequate
length
of
time
to
hold
a
general
assembly
session
and
reapportion
itself,
before
they
acted.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
early
next
year
there
is
scheduled
to
be,
an
attempt
for
--
mr.
james
manahan
the
court's
plan
would
not
conceivably
ever
apply
to
any
election.
mr.
james
manahan
the
court,
the
lower
court
has
stated
that
there
will
be
--
that
the
marion
county,
indiana
must
be
sub-districted
to
have
constitutional
plan.
it
also
has
--
that
there
is
a
presumption.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
but
sub-districting,
your
honor
and
sub-districting
is
not
allowable
under
the
indiana
constitution
except
under
the
supremacy
clause.
and
so
it
was
necessary
for
our
federal
court
to
find
or
for
the
state
court
--
for
a
court
to
find
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
supremacy
clause
that
marion
county,
indiana
must
be
sub-districted
otherwise
it
will
not
be
sub-districted
in
the
next
apportionment
and
the
entire
case
which
we
have
tried
will
be
there
again.
mr.
james
manahan
they
can
create
all
the
multi-members,
definitely.
the
district
court's
opinion
only
states
there
is
presumption
favoring
uniform
districts
and
did
cite
the
banzhaf
theory
as
well
as
other
matters
to
show
that
a
natural
“one
man,
one
vote”
violation
does
result
from
having
multi-member
districts
of
differing
size.
but
the
single
member
districting
is
in
no
way
called
for
by
the
lower
court's
opinion.
mr.
james
manahan
the
lower
court
says
there
must
be
uniform
districting
and
there
is
anything
but
uniform
districts
in
indiana
and
it
says,
they
must
be
small
enough
such
that
the
vote
of
the
ghetto
area
which
they
found
to,
just
as
a
fact,
would
not
be
diluted
or
canceled
out.
mr.
james
manahan
not
single.
they
must
be
small
enough
in
number,
and
the
court
indicated
that
three-man
districts
will
be
small
enough
in
number
or
perhaps
even
four
man
districts.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
james
manahan
your
honor
we
didn't
--
well,
greatly
we
have
a
difference.
we
did
prove,
we
did
submit
proof
in
six
elements
which
we
believed
were
necessary
under
fortson
v.
dorsey,
and
burns
v.
richardson
to
require
a
sub-districting
of
a
large
multi-member
district.
we
did
in
this
case
prove
the
existence
of
a
minority
group
of
the
type
you
described,
(inaudible).
we
also
proved
that
they
were,
that
they
lived
in
a
contagious
compact
area
so
that
a
difference
in
districting
could
make
a
difference.
we
also
proved
and
we
think
the
proof
was
very
substantial
that
they
were
sufficient
in
population
in
these
areas
to
affect
the
election
or
non-election
of
representatives
of
them,
if
there
were
an
impartial
districting
of
smaller
districts,
not
the
district
drawn
calculated
to
enhance
their
vote,
but
simply
impartially
drawn
smaller
districts.
finally,
we
also
proved
that
they
had
substantiative
interest.
mr.
james
manahan
absolutely
not.
the
district
with
the
support
group
did
nothing
of
a
kind,
near
squares
which
totally
ignore
what
they
found
to
be
the
"ghetto
area”
and
at
the
back
of
the
appellee's
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
does
appear
an
illustrate
of
what
was
found
to
be
the
"ghetto
area”
and
the
district
line
which
the
court
drew.
there
are
in
no
sense
--
the
district
lines
are
no
sense
coterminous
with
the
boundaries
of
the
ghetto
area.
they
are
a
series
of
squares
and
near
squares
which
cut
through
the
ghetto
area
ignoring
its
existence.
as
the
district
court
said
in
its
original
opinion,
distinct
lines
must
be
drawn
with
an
eye
that
is
color
blind.
mr.
james
manahan
no.
this
is
the
court's
plain
for
marion
county,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
oh,
these
squares
happen
to
be
single-member
districts,
15-single
member
--
mr.
james
manahan
well
this
was
not
the
court's
original
decision,
this
was
the
court's
final
order,
after
the
state
of
indiana
reduced
the
district,
these
are
districts
which
the
court
drew.
mr.
james
manahan
the
court
drew
nothing,
but
the
single-member
districts
throughout
the
state.
mr.
james
manahan
under
the
court
drawn
plan
--
mr.
james
manahan
that's
right.
mr.
james
manahan
only
they
are
taking
continuing
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
manahan
that
was
the
only
theory.
mr.
james
manahan
well,
we
got
the
ruling.
mr.
james
manahan
you
mean
multi-member
districting
is
different?
mr.
james
manahan
simply
the
court's
declaratory
judgment
in
effect,
that
such
districts
do
have
an
invidious
affect
and
do
dilute
the
vote
--
mr.
james
manahan
no,
this
is
the
court's
finding
specially
that,
the
multi-member
districting
of
marion
county
has
an
invidious
effect
which
dilutes
vote.
mr.
james
manahan
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
yes.
mr.
james
manahan
the
likelihood
of
any
--
they
carried
beyond,
find
their
findings
beyond
the
1960
census
in
their
decision.
their
decision
also
encompasses
social
statistics
as
late
as
1967
and
there
was
no
indication
that
there
will
be
any
--
mr.
james
manahan
on
the
matter
of
a
minority
group
existing
within
a
county
where
we
have
statistics
as
late
as
1967
--
mr.
james
manahan
i
would
say
not.
mr.
james
manahan
it
would
not.
mr.
james
manahan
i
said
they
would
not
be
violating
an
injunction
if
they
establish
a
multi-member
district
in
marion
county,
and
under
the
indiana
constitution
without
a
judgment
against
them,
they
will
have
to
have
a
multi-member
senate
district
in
marion
county,
indiana.
they
cannot
sub-district
a
county
for
the
state
senate
under
the
indiana
constitution.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
they
can.
mr.
james
manahan
they
will
feel
very
much
guided
by
this
court's
decision
and
there
is
no
decision
and
if
the
stay
remains
in
effect
and
the
lower
court's
opinion
that's
had
no
decision,
they
will
take
their
chances
on
the
multi-member
district.
mr.
james
manahan
that
would
be
end
of
the
case.
mr.
james
manahan
the
district
court
did
render
declaratory
judgment
to
the
effect
that
there
is
in
marion
county,
indiana
based
on
1967
and
a
later
statics
a
ghetto
area
with
a
minority
group
residing
therein
which
has
substantive
interest
which
diverges
significantly
from
those
as
a
county
as
a
whole
and
then
in
response
to
those
interests
engages
in
a
vote
in
pattern,
which
diverges
significantly
from
that
as
a
county
as
a
whole,
and
that
the
size
of
the
county,
the
size
of
this
multi-member
district
is
so
great
that
it
dilutes
and
cancels
out
that
significant
vote
by
that
there
was
a
significant
substantiative
interest.
that
declaratory
judgment
was
rendered
by
the
lower
court,
and
it
is
very
significant
what
type
of
districting
will
be
drawn
in
the
forthcoming
general
assembly
whether
or
not
that
declaratory
judgment
is
upheld
in
this
court.
mr.
james
manahan
and
hopefully
toward
--
mr.
james
manahan
--
and
towards
all
future
elections.
mr.
james
manahan
yes
and
--
mr.
james
manahan
and
in
marion
county,
they
are
obligated
either
under
the
indiana
constitution
to
have
a
multi-member
senate
district
in
marion
county,
indiana
or
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
to
have
smaller
districts
in
both
houses
in
marion
county,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
if
this
were
a
simple
minor
on
reapportionment
case,
and
the
things
that
happened
which
have
happened,
the
case
would
be
totally
moot.
it
is
not
moot
--
mr.
james
manahan
because
it
is
a
redistricting
case
as
opposed
to
a
reapportionment
case.
it
was
a
finding
that
a
certain
type
of
district
is
unconstitutional,
not
a
certain
specifically
drawn
district
is
unconstitutional
because
there
is
too
few
or
too
many
people
in
it,
but
because
a
certain
type
of
districting,
and
a
certain
part
of
a
certain
stage
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
manahan
they
are
based
on
figures
as
late
as
1967.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
it
would
have
to
be
repeated,
yes.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
in
the
rest
of
the
state,
they
would
be
allowed
to
break
up
no
county
for
purposes
of
drawing
senate
seats
under
the
indiana
constitution.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
great
problem
under
kirkpatrick
v.
preisler
for
them
to
draw
senate
seats
without
crossing
county
lines,
but
they
can
certainly
draw
multi-member
district
senate
seats
without
cutting,
breaking
up
counties
and
unless
the
supremacy
clause
requires
breaking
up
of
counties
in
the
indiana
senate,
there
will
be
multi-member
districts
in
marion
county,
and
lake
county
of
different
size
in
the
indiana
senate.
mr.
james
manahan
one
representative
and
each
of
them
was
numbered
1
through
100
statewide
and
the
odd
numbers
were
paired
with
even
numbers
degree
at
senate
seats.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
they
are
all
one
senator.
mr.
james
manahan
consisting
of
two
legislatives
--
representative
districts.
there'd
be
50
senators
and
100
representatives.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
right.
mr.
james
manahan
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
james
manahan
but
one
representative
and
every
senatorial
district
is
made
up
of
two
representatives.
mr.
james
manahan
there
are
no
requirements
with
respect
to
the
house
of
representatives,
with
respect
to
the
senate
--
mr.
james
manahan
there
could
be
multi-member
districts,
but
they
would
have
to
all
be
uniform
throughout
the
states
if
you
affirm.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
no.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
uniformly
--
mr.
james
manahan
no,
your
honor.
what
they
drew
was
--
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
but
they
were
drawing
up
a
plan.
they
were
actually
--
mr.
james
manahan
i
believe
–
on
what
page
your
honor?
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
but
not
necessarily
replacing
them
with
single
membered
districts.
mr.
james
manahan
that
this
says
that
districts
are
two
large,
and
they
must
be
smaller.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
in
fact
they
even
suggest
three-man
and
two-man
districts
in
this
opinion.
mr.
james
manahan
there
was
a
good
reason
for
that,
your
honor.
they
wanted
to
give
every
legislator
--
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
and
so
long
and
the
are
uniform.
mr.
james
manahan
right.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
for
the
entire
state,
they
did
single-member
districts.
mr.
james
manahan
is
what
they
drew,
yeah.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
they
want
to
set
up
rules
in
advance
so
that
different
groups
could
participate
for
both
plans.
they
needed
a
rule
such
that
a
comparison
could
be
made
between
plans.
so
they
made
a
least
political
decision,
just
said,
well
all
single-member
districts
and
we'll
take
the
plan
that's
best
that
has
the
least
population
deviation
which
is
what
they
did.
the
population
deviation
turned
out
to
be
less
than
1%
throughout
the
state,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
immediately
to
the
question
of
uniform
districts
and
why
we
believe
they
are
constitutionally
required
in
indiana.
there
was
a
very
strong
presentation
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
un-contradicted
and
both
sides
affirmatively
presented
affirmative
proof
that
when
they
are
in
the
indiana
general
assembly,
multi-member
district
delegation,
at
least
that
went
from
marion
county
vote
in
bluff
at
the
behest
of
the
party
organization
and
that
they
do
not
vote
on
their
own,
and
there
was
very
few
matters.
it
also
was
proven
that
they
are
elected
in
bluff
that
during
the
past
40
years,
only
twice
has
a
member
of
a
party
which
lost
generally
in
an
election
been
elected
to
the
indiana
general
assembly
from
marion
county,
indiana.
during
the
other
elections,
with
those
two
exceptions,
either
one
party
slate
or
the
other
was
elected.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
there
during
all
primary
elections
in
recent
memory,
the
official
party
organization
slate
was
nominated
to
run
for
the
indiana
general
assembly
and
persons
not
supported
by
the
organization
slate,
were
not
nominated
in
such
primary.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
those
persons
who
became,
on
the
organization
slate
were
throughly
controlled
by
the
central
committee
of
the
party
organization.
and
so
in
effect,
this
multi-membered
district
delegation
which
is
and
has
historically
been
elected
from
marion
county
is
a
unit
rule
delegation
controlled
at
one
source.
this
has
two
results.
this
demonstrates
that
parochial
interest
such
as
those
of
a
ghetto
area
could
not
realistically
be
represented,
and
pat
chavis,
the
plaintiff
who
had
been
the
sole
black
senator
in
the
indiana
general
assembly
during
the
past
10
years,
represented
that
he
could
not
effectively
represent
his
people
because
he
had
to
do
in
each
vote
what
his
county
chairman
wanted
him
to
do.
and
we
presented
evidence
showing
what
present
and
past
members
have
done
on
role
call,
voting
constantly
in
bluff.
this
is
pertinent
to
the
dilution
of
black
people
and
the
ghetto
area
of
marion
county,
indiana
and
is
also
pertinent
to
the
district
court's
finding
that
multi-member
districts
of
different
size
can
be
inherently
unconstitutional.
what
–
what
it
amounted
to
was
that
the
proof
showed
that
the
multi-membered
district
allegations
are
the
same
as
if
you
have
weighted
voting
because
they
voted
as
one
in
marion
county,
it's
the
same
as
having
one
representative
with
15
votes,
and
one
from
lake
county
with
11.
mr.
james
manahan
no.
the
history
is
that
we
have
never
had
single-member
districts
and
have
never
broken
up
any
county
for
any
districting
of
any
kind
in
the
general
assembly
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
indiana.
so
necessarily,
there
could
not
be
proof
–
that
there
was
a
deliberate
design
in
multi-member
districting.
it
came
out
before
there
were
black
people
in
indiana,
multi-member
districting
--
mr.
james
manahan
we
did
the
claim,
but
we
did
not
present
very
substantial
evidence
and
there
was
no
finding.
mr.
james
manahan
there
was
no
gomillion
finding.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
both
cases
of
state
--
mr.
james
manahan
otherwise.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
we
did
prove
the
otherwise
and
we
didn't
try
it
very
hard
to
prove
--
mr.
james
manahan
no
those
cases
say
and
fortson
v.
dorsey
and
burns
v.
richardson
say
what
they
say
and
we've
brought
this
entire
action
based
upon
what
those
two
majority
opinions
of
this
court
and
almost
anonymous
opinion
in
one
case
said,
and
those
are
the
two
decisions
we
are
specifically
relying
on.
their
language
and
what
they
said
would
count
as
a
good
redistricting
case.
mr.
james
manahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
manahan
there
would
be
no
invidious
effect
because
there
would
be
no
effect.
the
districting
would
not
effect
their
interest
at
all.
mr.
james
manahan
that
is
correct.
so
there
would
be
no
remedy
to
do
it
and
we
would
have
no
case.
that's
why
we
dared
to
show
that
they
were
compact,
and
i
think
my
time
is
expired.
i
thank
the
court
for
hearing
the
cause.
mr.
james
manahan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
i
believe
have
to
recapitulate
what
did
occur
in
this
case
because
i
believe
some
confusion
has
resulted
from
the
presentation
which
has
been
made
by
the
appellate
as
to
what
took
place.
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court
by
residents
of
marion
county
and
lake
county
seeking
only
the
single
member
districting
of
marion
county,
indiana
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
prior
guidelines
in
fortson
v.
dorsey,
and
in
burns
v.
richardson.
mr.
james
manahan
in
marion
--
no,
plaintiffs
from
marion
and
lake
county,
but
seeking
only
the
single
member
districting
of
marion
county,
indiana.
the
plaintiff
from
lake
county
being
for
purposes
of
supporting
the
banzhaf
theory,
for
the
purpose
of
breaking
up
the
marion
county
district
only.
mr.
james
manahan
pardon
me?
mr.
james
manahan
indianapolis,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
gary
and
hammond,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
there
were
numerous
multi-member
districts
in
indiana
--
mr.
james
manahan
both
of
those
were
the
largest
two.
mr.
james
manahan
immediately
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
request
for
admissions
118
in
number
were
filed.
the
complaint
itself
with
the
69-page
document
which
is
set
forth
full
in
the
appendix
and
the
request
permissions
were
likewise
lengthy.
before
the
trial,
all
of
these
request
permissions
which
covered
every
aspect
of
the
complaint
were
admitted
and
at
the
trial,
the
admitted
requests
were
admitted
into
evidence
without
objection.
also
during
the
trial,
numerous
other
documents
from
the
state
library
were
available,
and
the
court
had
an
abundance
of
evidence
before
it,
all
of
which
was
admitted
and
was
un-contradicted
and
as
we
will
outline
did
present
a
full
case
under
fortson
v.
dorsey,
and
burns
v.
richardson
justifying
the
sub-districting
of
marion
county,
indiana,
but
something
else
took
place
before
the
trial
of
this
cause.
the
kirkpatrick
v.
preisler
decision
was
rendered,
and
with
the
result
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial
and
it
appears
at
the
page
133
of
the
appendix,
justice
turner,
the
presiding
judge
took
--
stated
that
the
court
was
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
indiana
is
malapportioned
and
thus
the
court
had
little
choice
what
to
do.
as
it
developed
that
the
state
of
indiana's
districts,
one
of
which
was
before
the
court,
or
at
that
time
malapportioned
so
bad
they
had
greater
divergences
of
population
that
even
the
dissenting
in
opinions,
in
kirkpatrick
v.
preisler
indicated
would
be
allowable.
mr.
james
manahan
completely
forgetting
the
single
multi-member
district
--
mr.
james
manahan
there
were
more
senators
from
marion
county
than
they
were
entitled
to
--
mr.
james
manahan
and
exactly
the
right
amount
of
representatives,
they
were
--
they
had
one
half
of
this
full
senate
too
much.
the
same
was
too
in
lake
county,
and
before
it
reached
its
findings,
the
district
court
and
the
tables
at
the
end
of
their
july
28
opinion
reflected
they
are
too
are
in
the
appendix
at
page
382
and
383,
the
divergences
between
districts
and
the
mal-apportionment
of
the
traditional
kind
involving
all
the
counties
of
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
the
normal
impact,
they
would
now
be
preparing
to
reapportion
as
they
are.
if
this
lawsuit
--
mr.
james
manahan
the
court's
stay
order
in
this
cause
has
now
made
the
state-wide
mal-apportionment
of
indiana,
no
longer
matter
of
consequence,
since
indiana
will
be
reapportioned
before
there
is
another
election.
mr.
james
manahan
yes.
mr.
james
manahan
to
begin
a
new
reapportionment?
they
were
not
scheduled
to
begin
a
new
reapportionment
until
this
coming
january,
next
month
and
they
were
scheduled
to
hold
an
election
as
they
did
in
the
meantime.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
there
was
only
more
election
to
be
held
before
there
would
be
a
reapportionment,
or
a
attempted
reapportionment
in
normal
course.
the
state
of
indiana
also
has
notable
record
for
having
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
for
its
legislators
to
agree
upon
apportionment.
in
this
case
they
gave
the
state
of
indiana
and
adequate
length
of
time
to
hold
a
general
assembly
session
and
reapportion
itself,
before
they
acted.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
early
next
year
there
is
scheduled
to
be,
an
attempt
for
--
mr.
james
manahan
the
court's
plan
would
not
conceivably
ever
apply
to
any
election.
mr.
james
manahan
the
court,
the
lower
court
has
stated
that
there
will
be
--
that
the
marion
county,
indiana
must
be
sub-districted
to
have
constitutional
plan.
it
also
has
--
that
there
is
a
presumption.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
but
sub-districting,
your
honor
and
sub-districting
is
not
allowable
under
the
indiana
constitution
except
under
the
supremacy
clause.
and
so
it
was
necessary
for
our
federal
court
to
find
or
for
the
state
court
--
for
a
court
to
find
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
supremacy
clause
that
marion
county,
indiana
must
be
sub-districted
otherwise
it
will
not
be
sub-districted
in
the
next
apportionment
and
the
entire
case
which
we
have
tried
will
be
there
again.
mr.
james
manahan
they
can
create
all
the
multi-members,
definitely.
the
district
court's
opinion
only
states
there
is
presumption
favoring
uniform
districts
and
did
cite
the
banzhaf
theory
as
well
as
other
matters
to
show
that
a
natural
“one
man,
one
vote”
violation
does
result
from
having
multi-member
districts
of
differing
size.
but
the
single
member
districting
is
in
no
way
called
for
by
the
lower
court's
opinion.
mr.
james
manahan
the
lower
court
says
there
must
be
uniform
districting
and
there
is
anything
but
uniform
districts
in
indiana
and
it
says,
they
must
be
small
enough
such
that
the
vote
of
the
ghetto
area
which
they
found
to,
just
as
a
fact,
would
not
be
diluted
or
canceled
out.
mr.
james
manahan
not
single.
they
must
be
small
enough
in
number,
and
the
court
indicated
that
three-man
districts
will
be
small
enough
in
number
or
perhaps
even
four
man
districts.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
james
manahan
your
honor
we
didn't
--
well,
greatly
we
have
a
difference.
we
did
prove,
we
did
submit
proof
in
six
elements
which
we
believed
were
necessary
under
fortson
v.
dorsey,
and
burns
v.
richardson
to
require
a
sub-districting
of
a
large
multi-member
district.
we
did
in
this
case
prove
the
existence
of
a
minority
group
of
the
type
you
described,
(inaudible).
we
also
proved
that
they
were,
that
they
lived
in
a
contagious
compact
area
so
that
a
difference
in
districting
could
make
a
difference.
we
also
proved
and
we
think
the
proof
was
very
substantial
that
they
were
sufficient
in
population
in
these
areas
to
affect
the
election
or
non-election
of
representatives
of
them,
if
there
were
an
impartial
districting
of
smaller
districts,
not
the
district
drawn
calculated
to
enhance
their
vote,
but
simply
impartially
drawn
smaller
districts.
finally,
we
also
proved
that
they
had
substantiative
interest.
mr.
james
manahan
absolutely
not.
the
district
with
the
support
group
did
nothing
of
a
kind,
near
squares
which
totally
ignore
what
they
found
to
be
the
"ghetto
area”
and
at
the
back
of
the
appellee's
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
does
appear
an
illustrate
of
what
was
found
to
be
the
"ghetto
area”
and
the
district
line
which
the
court
drew.
there
are
in
no
sense
--
the
district
lines
are
no
sense
coterminous
with
the
boundaries
of
the
ghetto
area.
they
are
a
series
of
squares
and
near
squares
which
cut
through
the
ghetto
area
ignoring
its
existence.
as
the
district
court
said
in
its
original
opinion,
distinct
lines
must
be
drawn
with
an
eye
that
is
color
blind.
mr.
james
manahan
no.
this
is
the
court's
plain
for
marion
county,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
oh,
these
squares
happen
to
be
single-member
districts,
15-single
member
--
mr.
james
manahan
well
this
was
not
the
court's
original
decision,
this
was
the
court's
final
order,
after
the
state
of
indiana
reduced
the
district,
these
are
districts
which
the
court
drew.
mr.
james
manahan
the
court
drew
nothing,
but
the
single-member
districts
throughout
the
state.
mr.
james
manahan
under
the
court
drawn
plan
--
mr.
james
manahan
that's
right.
mr.
james
manahan
only
they
are
taking
continuing
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
manahan
that
was
the
only
theory.
mr.
james
manahan
well,
we
got
the
ruling.
mr.
james
manahan
you
mean
multi-member
districting
is
different?
mr.
james
manahan
simply
the
court's
declaratory
judgment
in
effect,
that
such
districts
do
have
an
invidious
affect
and
do
dilute
the
vote
--
mr.
james
manahan
no,
this
is
the
court's
finding
specially
that,
the
multi-member
districting
of
marion
county
has
an
invidious
effect
which
dilutes
vote.
mr.
james
manahan
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
yes.
mr.
james
manahan
the
likelihood
of
any
--
they
carried
beyond,
find
their
findings
beyond
the
1960
census
in
their
decision.
their
decision
also
encompasses
social
statistics
as
late
as
1967
and
there
was
no
indication
that
there
will
be
any
--
mr.
james
manahan
on
the
matter
of
a
minority
group
existing
within
a
county
where
we
have
statistics
as
late
as
1967
--
mr.
james
manahan
i
would
say
not.
mr.
james
manahan
it
would
not.
mr.
james
manahan
i
said
they
would
not
be
violating
an
injunction
if
they
establish
a
multi-member
district
in
marion
county,
and
under
the
indiana
constitution
without
a
judgment
against
them,
they
will
have
to
have
a
multi-member
senate
district
in
marion
county,
indiana.
they
cannot
sub-district
a
county
for
the
state
senate
under
the
indiana
constitution.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
they
can.
mr.
james
manahan
they
will
feel
very
much
guided
by
this
court's
decision
and
there
is
no
decision
and
if
the
stay
remains
in
effect
and
the
lower
court's
opinion
that's
had
no
decision,
they
will
take
their
chances
on
the
multi-member
district.
mr.
james
manahan
that
would
be
end
of
the
case.
mr.
james
manahan
the
district
court
did
render
declaratory
judgment
to
the
effect
that
there
is
in
marion
county,
indiana
based
on
1967
and
a
later
statics
a
ghetto
area
with
a
minority
group
residing
therein
which
has
substantive
interest
which
diverges
significantly
from
those
as
a
county
as
a
whole
and
then
in
response
to
those
interests
engages
in
a
vote
in
pattern,
which
diverges
significantly
from
that
as
a
county
as
a
whole,
and
that
the
size
of
the
county,
the
size
of
this
multi-member
district
is
so
great
that
it
dilutes
and
cancels
out
that
significant
vote
by
that
there
was
a
significant
substantiative
interest.
that
declaratory
judgment
was
rendered
by
the
lower
court,
and
it
is
very
significant
what
type
of
districting
will
be
drawn
in
the
forthcoming
general
assembly
whether
or
not
that
declaratory
judgment
is
upheld
in
this
court.
mr.
james
manahan
and
hopefully
toward
--
mr.
james
manahan
--
and
towards
all
future
elections.
mr.
james
manahan
yes
and
--
mr.
james
manahan
and
in
marion
county,
they
are
obligated
either
under
the
indiana
constitution
to
have
a
multi-member
senate
district
in
marion
county,
indiana
or
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
to
have
smaller
districts
in
both
houses
in
marion
county,
indiana.
mr.
james
manahan
if
this
were
a
simple
minor
on
reapportionment
case,
and
the
things
that
happened
which
have
happened,
the
case
would
be
totally
moot.
it
is
not
moot
--
mr.
james
manahan
because
it
is
a
redistricting
case
as
opposed
to
a
reapportionment
case.
it
was
a
finding
that
a
certain
type
of
district
is
unconstitutional,
not
a
certain
specifically
drawn
district
is
unconstitutional
because
there
is
too
few
or
too
many
people
in
it,
but
because
a
certain
type
of
districting,
and
a
certain
part
of
a
certain
stage
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
manahan
they
are
based
on
figures
as
late
as
1967.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
it
would
have
to
be
repeated,
yes.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
in
the
rest
of
the
state,
they
would
be
allowed
to
break
up
no
county
for
purposes
of
drawing
senate
seats
under
the
indiana
constitution.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
great
problem
under
kirkpatrick
v.
preisler
for
them
to
draw
senate
seats
without
crossing
county
lines,
but
they
can
certainly
draw
multi-member
district
senate
seats
without
cutting,
breaking
up
counties
and
unless
the
supremacy
clause
requires
breaking
up
of
counties
in
the
indiana
senate,
there
will
be
multi-member
districts
in
marion
county,
and
lake
county
of
different
size
in
the
indiana
senate.
mr.
james
manahan
one
representative
and
each
of
them
was
numbered
1
through
100
statewide
and
the
odd
numbers
were
paired
with
even
numbers
degree
at
senate
seats.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
they
are
all
one
senator.
mr.
james
manahan
consisting
of
two
legislatives
--
representative
districts.
there'd
be
50
senators
and
100
representatives.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
right.
mr.
james
manahan
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
james
manahan
but
one
representative
and
every
senatorial
district
is
made
up
of
two
representatives.
mr.
james
manahan
there
are
no
requirements
with
respect
to
the
house
of
representatives,
with
respect
to
the
senate
--
mr.
james
manahan
there
could
be
multi-member
districts,
but
they
would
have
to
all
be
uniform
throughout
the
states
if
you
affirm.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
no.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
uniformly
--
mr.
james
manahan
no,
your
honor.
what
they
drew
was
--
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
but
they
were
drawing
up
a
plan.
they
were
actually
--
mr.
james
manahan
i
believe
–
on
what
page
your
honor?
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
but
not
necessarily
replacing
them
with
single
membered
districts.
mr.
james
manahan
that
this
says
that
districts
are
two
large,
and
they
must
be
smaller.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
in
fact
they
even
suggest
three-man
and
two-man
districts
in
this
opinion.
mr.
james
manahan
there
was
a
good
reason
for
that,
your
honor.
they
wanted
to
give
every
legislator
--
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
and
so
long
and
the
are
uniform.
mr.
james
manahan
right.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
for
the
entire
state,
they
did
single-member
districts.
mr.
james
manahan
is
what
they
drew,
yeah.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
they
want
to
set
up
rules
in
advance
so
that
different
groups
could
participate
for
both
plans.
they
needed
a
rule
such
that
a
comparison
could
be
made
between
plans.
so
they
made
a
least
political
decision,
just
said,
well
all
single-member
districts
and
we'll
take
the
plan
that's
best
that
has
the
least
population
deviation
which
is
what
they
did.
the
population
deviation
turned
out
to
be
less
than
1%
throughout
the
state,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
immediately
to
the
question
of
uniform
districts
and
why
we
believe
they
are
constitutionally
required
in
indiana.
there
was
a
very
strong
presentation
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
un-contradicted
and
both
sides
affirmatively
presented
affirmative
proof
that
when
they
are
in
the
indiana
general
assembly,
multi-member
district
delegation,
at
least
that
went
from
marion
county
vote
in
bluff
at
the
behest
of
the
party
organization
and
that
they
do
not
vote
on
their
own,
and
there
was
very
few
matters.
it
also
was
proven
that
they
are
elected
in
bluff
that
during
the
past
40
years,
only
twice
has
a
member
of
a
party
which
lost
generally
in
an
election
been
elected
to
the
indiana
general
assembly
from
marion
county,
indiana.
during
the
other
elections,
with
those
two
exceptions,
either
one
party
slate
or
the
other
was
elected.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
there
during
all
primary
elections
in
recent
memory,
the
official
party
organization
slate
was
nominated
to
run
for
the
indiana
general
assembly
and
persons
not
supported
by
the
organization
slate,
were
not
nominated
in
such
primary.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
those
persons
who
became,
on
the
organization
slate
were
throughly
controlled
by
the
central
committee
of
the
party
organization.
and
so
in
effect,
this
multi-membered
district
delegation
which
is
and
has
historically
been
elected
from
marion
county
is
a
unit
rule
delegation
controlled
at
one
source.
this
has
two
results.
this
demonstrates
that
parochial
interest
such
as
those
of
a
ghetto
area
could
not
realistically
be
represented,
and
pat
chavis,
the
plaintiff
who
had
been
the
sole
black
senator
in
the
indiana
general
assembly
during
the
past
10
years,
represented
that
he
could
not
effectively
represent
his
people
because
he
had
to
do
in
each
vote
what
his
county
chairman
wanted
him
to
do.
and
we
presented
evidence
showing
what
present
and
past
members
have
done
on
role
call,
voting
constantly
in
bluff.
this
is
pertinent
to
the
dilution
of
black
people
and
the
ghetto
area
of
marion
county,
indiana
and
is
also
pertinent
to
the
district
court's
finding
that
multi-member
districts
of
different
size
can
be
inherently
unconstitutional.
what
–
what
it
amounted
to
was
that
the
proof
showed
that
the
multi-membered
district
allegations
are
the
same
as
if
you
have
weighted
voting
because
they
voted
as
one
in
marion
county,
it's
the
same
as
having
one
representative
with
15
votes,
and
one
from
lake
county
with
11.
mr.
james
manahan
no.
the
history
is
that
we
have
never
had
single-member
districts
and
have
never
broken
up
any
county
for
any
districting
of
any
kind
in
the
general
assembly
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
indiana.
so
necessarily,
there
could
not
be
proof
–
that
there
was
a
deliberate
design
in
multi-member
districting.
it
came
out
before
there
were
black
people
in
indiana,
multi-member
districting
--
mr.
james
manahan
we
did
the
claim,
but
we
did
not
present
very
substantial
evidence
and
there
was
no
finding.
mr.
james
manahan
there
was
no
gomillion
finding.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
both
cases
of
state
--
mr.
james
manahan
otherwise.
mr.
james
manahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
manahan
no,
we
did
prove
the
otherwise
and
we
didn't
try
it
very
hard
to
prove
--
mr.
james
manahan
no
those
cases
say
and
fortson
v.
dorsey
and
burns
v.
richardson
say
what
they
say
and
we've
brought
this
entire
action
based
upon
what
those
two
majority
opinions
of
this
court
and
almost
anonymous
opinion
in
one
case
said,
and
those
are
the
two
decisions
we
are
specifically
relying
on.
their
language
and
what
they
said
would
count
as
a
good
redistricting
case.
mr.
james
manahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
manahan
there
would
be
no
invidious
effect
because
there
would
be
no
effect.
the
districting
would
not
effect
their
interest
at
all.
mr.
james
manahan
that
is
correct.
so
there
would
be
no
remedy
to
do
it
and
we
would
have
no
case.
that's
why
we
dared
to
show
that
they
were
compact,
and
i
think
my
time
is
expired.
i
thank
the
court
for
hearing
the
cause.
