mr.
william
f.
thompson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
f.
thompson.
i
am
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
indiana.
this
morning
or
this
afternoon
i
will
--
arguing
on
behalf
of
appellant,
the
governor
of
the
state
of
indiana.
i
am
accompanied
this
afternoon
at
counsel
table
by
theodore
l.
sendak,
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
indiana,
and
richard
c.
johnson,
his
chief
deputy.
in
our
brief
in
this
case
we
presented
this
court
with
six
issues.
this
afternoon
the
state
will
concentrate
its
argument
on
two
of
those
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
constitution
permits
or
requires
that
a
racial/socioeconomic
group
be
proportionally
represented
in
the
state
legislature
by
representatives
elected
from
that
group.
secondly,
whether
the
constitution
requires
all
state
legislative
districts
to
be
the
same
size.
if
time
allows,
the
state
will
discuss
the
remaining
issues.
i
would
be
glad
to,
would
be
pleased
to
answer
any
questions
this
court
may
have
regarding
them.
this
action
began
as
an
action
for
declaratory
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court.
it
was
brought
by
negro
residents
of
marion
county,
indiana.
marion
county
is
one
of
92
counties
in
indiana.
the
plaintiffs
below
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
marion
county
multi-member
districting
scheme.
marion
county
provides
for
the
at
large
election
of
15
members
of
the
house
representatives
and
8
members
of
the
senate.
this
action
does
not
involve
congressional
districting,
is
limited
solely
to
state
legislative
districts.
following
this
court's
decision
in
baker
v.
carr,
indiana
began
the
long
road
to
reapportionment.
in
1963,
it
reapportioned,
in
1965
it
again
reapportioned.
the
1965
act
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court
in
the
case
of
stout
v.
bottorff,
that's
the
first
district
court
case.
a
special
session
of
the
65
legislature
was
called,
and
they
again
enacted
an
apportionment
act,
that
was
the
apportionment
act
of
1965
and
that
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
was
the
member
of
the
1965
legislature,
that
enacted
the
1965
act,
that
he
voted
for
that
act
and
that
he
now
attacks
that
act.
there
were
six
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below,
one
was
a
resident
of
the
lake
county,
another
county
in
indiana,
five
of
the
plaintiffs
were
residents
of
marion
county.
the
district
court
found
in
favor
of
only
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
from
marion
county,
only
one
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
found
by
the
district
court
being
entitled
to
relief.
that
was
mason
bryant,
mason
bryant
was
the
resident
of
an
area,
within
marion
county,
which
the
district
court
denominated
as
the
center
township
ghetto.
he
was
the
resident
and
voter
of
the
center
township
ghetto.
the
center
township
is
one
of
the
nine
townships
of
marion
county.
it's
approximately
in
the
center
of
the
county,
the
other
townships
are
ranged
around
it.
the
center
township
ghetto
is
approximately
the
northern
half
of
the
center
township.
the
area
designated
by
the
court
as
the
ghetto
is
predominantly
populated
by
negroes
who
are
poor
and
less
well
educated
from
the
rest
of
the
county.
i
might
point
out
that
the
term
ghetto
is
the
term
used
by
the
appellees
and
by
the
district
court.
the
area
to
which
this
refers
is
not
regarded
in
the
community
as
a
ghetto,
it's
not
called
that
in
the
community
and
to
a
certain
extent
it's
non-descriptive
of
the
area
involved.
from
the
rest
of
the
county,
the
district
court
selected
an
area,
washington
township
and
compared
the
number
of
legislators
who
were
residents
of
washington
township
to
the
member
of
legislators
who
were
residents
of
the
center
township
ghetto.
an
absolute
numbers
are
washington
township
had
more
senators
than
the
center
township
negroes.
the
court
computed
ratios
and
found
that
washington
township
ratio
was
greater
from
the
center
township
ratio.
on
this
basis
the
district
court
declared
that
the
vote
of
the
center
township
negroes
was
diluted
and
canceled
out
by
the
marion
county
multi-member
district.
rather
than
limited
relief
to
merely
sub-districting
marion
county,
the
district
court
ordered
the
reapportionment
of
the
entire
state.
although,
the
court
appeared
to
rely
upon
a
straight
“one
man,
one
vote”
analysis
of
reynolds,
the
true
basis
for
requiring
the
reapportionment
of
the
entire
state
was
the
testimony
of
john
banzhaf.
john
banzhaf
is
an
associate
professor
of
law
at
george
washington
university
and
has
written
some
articles
regarding
multi-member
districts
and
testified
at
this
trial
at
the
hearing
to
this
case.
he
testified
that
apportionment
plans
providing
for
districts
of
different
sizes,
a
mix
system
of
multi-member
districts
and
single
member
districts,
created
inherent
inequities
and
was
unconstitutional
per
se.
on
this
basis
and
on
the
basis
of
clerical
considerations,
political
factors
which
the
district
court
found
to
exist
within
the
county,
the
district
court
required
that
when
the
state
reapportioned
that
all
districts
be
the
same
size.
on
july
28th
the
district
court
declared
the
1965
apportionment
act
unconstitutional
as
to
the
multi-member
districting
provisions
relating
to
marion
county.
the
district
court
gave
a
stay
till
october
1
to
reapportionment.
the
legislature
was
not
in
session
at
the
time
that
the
act
was
declared
unconstitutional.
we
had
at
that
time
biennial
sessions.
the
district
or
the
legislature
would
not
reconvene
until
january
1971,
accordingly
the
state
did
not
reapportioned.
on
october
15,
the
court
reconvened
and
invited
plans
from
the
parties,
the
plaintiffs,
the
defendants,
intervening
defendants,
legislative
leaders
and
interested
parties
in
general.
on
october
17,
the
district
court
announced
the
minimum
guidelines,
the
1960
census
data
would
be
used.
single
member
districts
would
be
preferred
over
multi-member
districts.
town,
county
and
township
lines
would
be
crossed
when
necessary,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
indiana
constitution
and
that
the
district
court
would
take
cognizance
of
the
existence
and
location
of
the
center
township
negroes.
the
plan
adapted
by
the
court
was
the
court's
plan
supplemented
by
the
plans
submitted
by
the
appellees
in
this
case.
the
appellees
submitted
a
plan
pertaining
only
to
marion
county.
the
court's
plans
as
adopted
did
rely
on
the
1960
census,
did
cross
some
county
and
township
lines,
did
take
cognizance
of
the
existence
and
location
of
the
center
township
negro
area.
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
this
regard
that
one
of
the
plans
submitted
by
the
intervening
defendants
had
variances
that
were
substantially
the
same
as
the
variances
in
the
plan
provided
by
the
appellees.
the
district
court
rejected
that
plan
because
in
its
estimation
it
did
not
take
cognizance
of
the
center
township
negro
area.
on
december
15,
the
district
court
announced
that
its
plan
would
be
the
plan,
would
be
the
apportionment
scheme
for
the
1970
election.
it
enjoined
all
state
election
officials
permanently
from
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
1965
act.
it
mandated
all
state
election
officials
to
conduct
the
1970
election
in
accordance
with
the
court's
plan.
furthermore,
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction,
permanent
jurisdiction
apparently
to
pass
on
any
future
claims
that
the
plaintiffs'
might
have
regarding
any
future
plan
of
apportionment
which
the
legislature
might
draft,
sort
of
a
super
legislative
veto.
the
state
of
indiana
appealed.
on
january
6,
the
governor
moved
the
district
court
to
stay
its
judgment.
the
district
court
refused.
the
state
on
january
20
--
the
next
day,
the
governor
applied
to
this
court
for
a
stay,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
and
on
february
2,
this
court
granted
the
governor's
application
for
a
stay.
the
1970
election
was
conducted
under
the
1965
act.
this
is
the
act
that
was
specifically
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
the
second
stout
case.
the
district
court
specifically
approved
the
constitutionality
of
that
act.
the
district
court
in
that
case
specifically
found
that
the
1965
act
met
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
turning
to
the
first
issue,
the
state
submits
that
constitution
does
not
in
fact
require
racial,
socioeconomic
groups
to
be
proportionally
represented
in
the
state
legislature
by
representatives
elected
from
that
ethnic
group.
the
district
court's
judgment
in
this
case
that
the
residents
of
the
center
township
area
--
that
the
vote
of
the
residents
of
the
center
township
area
was
canceled
out,
was
based
on
two
erroneous
assumptions.
first,
that
the
center
township
negro
area
was
proven
on
this
record
to
exist
as
a
distinct
from
cohesive
area
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
county.
the
second
erroneous
assumption
upon
which
the
district
court
based
its
judgment
is
that
fewer
legislative
persons
resided
in
the
center
township
area,
than
in
the
washington
township
area,
the
adjoining
area.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
that's
a
matter
of
some
speculation,
your
honor.
the
primary
holding
in
this
case
--
well,
first
of
all
you
have
the
district
court's
decision
in
1965
which
had
already
passed
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
1965
act
under
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
principles
of
reynolds.
now,
along
comes
this
case,
about
four
years
later.
the
court
looks
at
it
and
says,
well,
first
of
all
this
court
has
changed
the
standards,
secondly,
we
now
have
a
new
theory,
the
banzhaf
analysis
that
multi-member
and
single-member
districts
are
inherently
unconstitutional.
the
court
went
from
the
finding
that
these
defendants,
these
plaintiffs
were
invidiously
discriminated
against,
it
went
from
that
finding
to
the
conclusion
that
the
entire
state
had
to
be
reapportioned.
it
is
just
--
there
is
a
complete
gap
in
there
as
to
why
the
whole
state
had
to
be
reapportioned.
the
district
court
specifically
said
that
when
once
marion
county,
it
sub
districted,
there
would
be
unallowable
variances,
but
that's
patently
absurd.
either
it
was
malapportioned
--
well,
you
have
legislators
for
persons
in
there,
it's
going
to
be
the
same
after
you
reapportion
as
it
was
before,
either
it
was
okay
before
or
it
wasn't,
but
the
district
court
already
said
it
was.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
that's
exactly
the
way
they
went.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
explanation
of
what
happened.
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
that
would
have
been
a
reason
to
reapportion
the
entire
state.
that
would
not
have
been
a
reason
to
sub-district,
necessarily
a
reason
to
sub-district,
while
i
guess
it
follows
that
marion
county
would
have
to
be
sub-districted
because
it's
the
largest
district
in
the
state.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
one
of
the
problems
in
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
think
they
did,
i
think
they
did.
an
interesting
part
of
that
preposition
is
that
the
court
only
found
in
favor
of
mason
bryant
who
was
a
member
of
the
multi-member
district.
there
was
no
member
--
the
court
didn't,
if
the
court
is
going
to
find
that
someone's
rights
have
been
violated,
then
it
has
to
have
the
man
before
it
who's
right
has
been
violated.
mason
bryant
under
the
court's
analysis
was
over
represented.
the
court
had
no
one
--
well,
the
court
filed
in
favor
of
no
one
before
it
in
terms
of
having
being
under
represented,
the
court
went
both
ways.
in
the
invidious
discrimination
argument,
breaking
up
the
marion
county
district,
the
court
found
that
mason
bryant
was
under
represented.
applying
the
banzhaf
analysis,
the
court
found
that
marine
county
was
over
represented.
they
tried
to
have
it
both
ways.
to
reach
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
as
the
marine
county
multi-member
district,
it
had
to
first
find
--
first
had
to
section
off
a
distinct
area
then
had
to
compare
--
divide
some
meaningful
basis
to
compare
that
area
to
another
area.
to
do
that,
it
conducted
what
it
called
a
statistical
analysis,
which
i
won't
to
treat
here
because
i
feel
that
i
have
adequately
treated
it
in
brief,
but
i
feel
that
the
statistical
analysis
the
court
applied
amounts
to
gross
speculation,
that
the
center
township
negro
area
amounts
to
a
separate
distinct
area
within
the
county.
the
second
step
which
the
court
used
was
to
compare
the
ratios,
the
ratio
of
legislator
per
person
of
the
center
township
negro
area
to
the
washington
township
area.
to
do
this,
the
township
lines,
the
township
boundaries;
these
two
--
these
areas
that
are
being
compared
have
to
have
some
political
significance.
implied
in
the
court's
decision
is
that
somehow
legislate
--
residents
in
washington
township
are
better
represented,
but
a
legislator
from
washington
township
doesn't
represent
all
the
legislators
in
the
county,
but
somehow
he
only
represents
the
residents
in
washington
township.
somehow
the
residents
of
washington
township
are
specially
benefited
by
having
legislators
elected
from
there.
that
somehow
washington
township
legislators
did
not
represent
residents
of
the
center
township
negro
area.
the
record
refutes
those
conclusions.
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
in
this
case
mr.
chavis
was
a
resident
of
washington
township.
he
testified
that
when
he
was
in
the
legislature
he
represented
the
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
a
legislator
living
outside
of
the
center
township
negro
area
can
represent
the
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
in
that
regard,
your
honor?
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
your
honor.
not
at
all,
that
was
a
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
none.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no
discrimination,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
in
this
case,
mr.
chavis
testified,
that
in
these
two
areas
the
laws
were
perfectly
inadequate,
in
the
areas
of
welfare
and
unemployment
compensation.
he
said,
the
laws
are
adequate.
the
problem
is
with
the
attitudes
of
the
people
that
are
administering
those
laws.
that's
not
a
problem
of
discrimination.
that's
not
this
kind
of
problem
of
discrimination,
that's
another
kind
of
problem.
our
concern
here
is
whether
these
people
are
represented
in
the
legislature.
the
record
–-
okay
--
in
the
same
regard
chavis
also
testified
that
the
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes
were
shared
--
were
common
with
the
residents
of
the
rest
of
the
county,
with
the
residents
of
the
rest
of
the
state,
that's
it
was
counted
with
negroes
living
in
areas
outside
of
the
center
township
area.
the
significance
of
this
is
that,
if
the
interest
of
the
negroes
living
in
the
center
township
are
not
being
fully
pushed
along,
fully
been
taken
care
of,
that
neither
the
interest
of
citizens
in
other
areas
of
the
state.
in
the
same
regard,
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
indiana,
their
welfare
laws
--
we
also
have
consumer
protection
laws,
unemployment
compensation.
any
interest
that
you
can
think
of
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
claimed
they
had,
there
is
a
law
providing
for
that,
there
is
a
law
provided
for
that.
i
think
that's
an
example
of
the
fact
that
their
interests
have
not
been
ignored
in
the
legislature.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
the
district
court
says,
that
the
center
township
negroes
have
compelling
interests
in
things
like
urban
renewal,
and
welfare,
legislation,
law
and
order,
schooling,
education,
health,
so
on
and
so
forth.
these
were
the
compelling
interests
of
the
center
township
negroes.
they
are
piece
of
the
interest
that
we
share
with
those
people
in
common.
it's
an
interest
we
have
in
common.
and
there
are
laws
in
the
books
that
attempt
to
regulate
or
in
some
way
take
care
of
these
interests
and
i
think
this
an
example
of
fact
that
their
interest
are
not
ignored.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
sort
of
yes
and
no.
generally
speaking,
no
your
honor.
the
legislature
enacts
the
laws
and
they
are
carried
out
by
some
other
body.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
except
to
change
the
law.
they
did
first
state
out
a
point
the
department
has,
take
the
welfare
department,
look
how
that's
broken
down,
you
have
the
state
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
there
are
a
few
standing
committees,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
few,
very
few.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
okay.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
but
not
continuing
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
the
legislature
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
oh
yes!
definitely.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
fully
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
wouldn't
say
is
it's
the
difference,
your
honor,
i
would
say
it's
the
same
sort
of
control
that
congress
would
have,
only
probably
less
so
because
of
the
fact
that,
i
apparently
mean
(inaudible)
there
are
no,
there
are
a
few
standing
committees,
but
the
characteristics
between
the
two,
i
think
they
are
parallel.
one
other
example
of
fact
that
the,
one
other
fact
to
show
that
the
legislative
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes
are
not
ignored,
is
the
tax
money
that's
appropriated
for
the
very
things
that
the
district
court
said
they
were
most
interested
in;
urban
renewal,
schools,
education,
health,
welfare,
unemployment
compensation.
the
tax
money
that's
appropriated,
that
goes
into
this
areas
is
disproportionately
large
as
the
money
that's
going
into
the
rest
of
the
county.
the
remedy
correct
the
delusion
which
the
district
court
found
to
exist
in
marion
county
was
the
subdistrict
of
marion
county.
the
state
submits
that
this
a
retreat
to
the
separate
but
equal
doctrine
of
plessy
v.
ferguson.
in
requiring
that
the
districts
--
that
the
center
township
negro
areas
be
separately
districted,
district
court
was
saying,
let's
make
them
separate
but
equal.
if
it
is
--
if
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
allowed
to
stand,
districts
must
be
drawn
to
separate
and
segregate
citizens
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
economic
conditions,
and
other
special
interests.
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
to
carry
that
out
a
step
further
and
if
we
are
going
to
have
ethnic
or
proportional
representation,
perhaps
the
next
suit
will
be
a
suit
against
the
state
to
increase
the
size
of
its
legislature
so
that
these
interests
can
be
represented
with
some
degree
of
precision.
in
the
final
analysis,
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
special
interest
group.
the
center
township
negroes
in
this
case
claimed
to
have
special
interest.
well,
we
all
do.
as
a
lawyer
i
have
special
interest.
as
a
citizen
my
interest
may
differ
from
someone
else,
but
i
have
special
interest.
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion,
the
district
court
would
require
that
every
special
interest
have
its
own
representatives,
may
it
be
a
lawyer's
representative
or
a
school
representative.
heretofore
we
have
called
these
people
obvious
but
we
haven't
given
them
a
representative
to
represent
them
in
the
legislature.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
that
seems
--
for
marion
county
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
the
legislative
leaders
were
invited
to
submit
a
plan.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
they
were
given
several
days
in
which
to
do
that.
and
i
believe
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
pardon
me?
mr.
william
f.
thompson
several
days
and
i
believe
i
did
submit
a
plan.
as
a
matter
of
--
and
the
plaintiffs
were
in
invited,
the
plaintiffs
and
defendants
were
invited
to
submit
plans
to
the
district
court.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
no,
they
were
just
legislative
leaders.
that's
one
of
the
committees
or
--
i
can't
really
say
how
it
is
that
these
people
came
together
to
submit
this
plan,
but
they
did,
but
the
legislature
was
not
in
session.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
oh
yes!
quite
clear.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
as
the
action
started
out
it
was
initiated
against
all
the
legislators.
but
then
the
governor
was
added,
and
the
legislature
was
dropped
and
the
governor
was
left
in
the
action.
the
governor
is
the
only
defendant
appellant
now
left
in
this
action
on
behalf
of
the
state.
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
this
proportional
representation
issue,
the
designation
of
the
center
township
negro
area
implies
the
singling
out
on
the
basis
of
race
and
color.
you
can't
single
this
area
out
without
looking
at
the
race
of
the
people
living
there,
their
economic
condition
and
so
on.
separately
districting
marion
county
--
no
separately
districting
the
center
township
negroes
is
a
singling
on
the
basis
of
race
and
color.
you
can't
draw
the
lines
around
it
--
around
this
group,
unless
you
look
at
them
and
determine
in
advance
before
you
draw
those
lines
what
is
their
race,
what
is
their
color,
what
is
their
creed,
so
on
and
so
forth.
this
court
has
uniformly
condemned
all
such
attempts,
and
should
do
so
in
this
case
by
reversing
a
decision
on
the
district
court.
the
other
issue
i
want
to
hit
upon
briefly
is
the
banzhaf
issue,
the
striking
down,
finding
all
multi-member
districts
unconstitutional
per
se.
it
has
always
been
thought,
it's
been
implied
and
accepted
that
although
a
voter
in
a
multi-member
district
had
an
advantage
because
he
had
more
representatives
from
which
to
--for
whom
to
vote,
that
this
advantage
was
offset
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
part
of
the
larger
electorate
competing
with
him
to
vote
for
these
individuals.
this
has
been
challenged
by
john
banzhaf
and
others.
banzhaf
analysis
briefly
is
that
voters
in
the
marion
county
multi-member
district
were
over-represented
vis-à-vis
smaller
multi-member
districts
and
single
member-districts
within
the
state.
there
was
an
inherent
disparity
and
it
was
based
on
rather
complex
mathematical
equations
which
he
devised.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
this
that
the
court
required,
the
district
court
required
the
state
to
reapportion
the
entire
state.
the
problem
with
banzhaf's
theory
is
that
first
of
all
as
it
relates
to
this
case,
no
independent
study
was
made
of
indiana.
the
figures
and
maps,
exhibits,
and
so
on
and
so
forth
used
by
banzhaf
in
this
case
where
those
supplied
to
him
by
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
the
district
court,
in
its
december
15
order
retained
permanent
jurisdiction
of
case.
they
said
all
future
claims
by
these
plaintiffs
against
all
future
legislative
acts,
that's
number
one.
number
two,
65
--
the
state
has
been
permanently
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
1965
act.
as
a
technical
matter,
that's
the
only
apportionment
act
we
have
at
this
time.
well
legislation
-
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
would
not
--
i
wouldn't
expect.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
would
not
expect
one,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no
your
honor,
i
definitely
don't
think.
the
legislature,
because
of
this
decision
in
the
district
court,
the
legislature
is,
to
use
a
phrase
under
the
gun,
they
have
to
break
up
the
marion
county
multi-member
district.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
pardon
me.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
why
would
they?
mr.
william
f.
thompson
your
honor,
it's
a
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
because
they
could
very
well
expect
the
plaintiffs
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
the
very
same
district
court
obtain
the
very
same
thing,
that
they
have
obtained
in
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
your
honor,
in
the
state's
view
of
it,
the
record
in
this
case
was
so
thin
that
if
i
could
do
that
on
that,
they
could
do
it
on
anything.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
would
you
repeat
that
please
your
honor?
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well
the
constitution
as
interrupted
by
this
court
in
reynolds
where
this
court
says
that
decennial
reapportionment
ought
to
be
adequate,
constitutional
decennial
reapportionment
ought
to
be
adequate.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
that's
congressional
districts.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
congressional
districts
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
but
i
don't
think
that
pertains
to
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
i
cannot
answer
that
question
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
what
the
state
constitution
provides
in
that
respect.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well
no,
in
a
sense
of
being
bound,
they
would
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
but
as
a
practical
matter
your
honor,
the
state
can
expect
to
be
back
in
court
on
the
same
issues,
the
same
district
court
on
the
same
issues
and
if
they
don't
--
if
they
provide
essentially
same
plan,
complying
with
reynolds
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
would
like
to
think
your
honor
we
would
not
be
back
in
court
on
banzhaf's
analysis
and
separately
districting
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
we've
just
had
an
election
for
the
legislature
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
the
next
one
is
1970,
1972
sure.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
this
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
let
me
say
this
your
honor.
the
legislature
means
in
january
of
1971.
this
action
was
started
in
january
1969,
and
to
conduct
a
1970
election
we
had
to
get
stay,
so
that
if
we
were
to
–
if
the
court
were
to
say
we
would
be
back
to
where
we
were
two
years
from
now
we
will
be
back
on
the
same
problem.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
right
your
honor,
we
don't
know.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
i
don't
–
it's
my
position
–
it's
state’s
position
if
the
case
is
submitted.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes
your
honor,
and
then
we
would
have
to
--
if
this
court
didn't
decide
these
issues.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
the
district
court
said
it
would
in
it’s
december
15
order
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
your
honor
as
the
state
interprets
--
as
the
state
interprets
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
multi-member
district
in
marion
county
is
okay.
it
meets
constitutional
muster
and
that
districts
of
different
sizes
within
the
state
meets
constitutional
muster,
but
that's
not
what
the
district
court
says.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
the
point
that
this
court
says
vacates
or
decides
the
case
as
moot
has
no
significance.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
f.
thompson.
i
am
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
indiana.
this
morning
or
this
afternoon
i
will
--
arguing
on
behalf
of
appellant,
the
governor
of
the
state
of
indiana.
i
am
accompanied
this
afternoon
at
counsel
table
by
theodore
l.
sendak,
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
indiana,
and
richard
c.
johnson,
his
chief
deputy.
in
our
brief
in
this
case
we
presented
this
court
with
six
issues.
this
afternoon
the
state
will
concentrate
its
argument
on
two
of
those
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
constitution
permits
or
requires
that
a
racial/socioeconomic
group
be
proportionally
represented
in
the
state
legislature
by
representatives
elected
from
that
group.
secondly,
whether
the
constitution
requires
all
state
legislative
districts
to
be
the
same
size.
if
time
allows,
the
state
will
discuss
the
remaining
issues.
i
would
be
glad
to,
would
be
pleased
to
answer
any
questions
this
court
may
have
regarding
them.
this
action
began
as
an
action
for
declaratory
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court.
it
was
brought
by
negro
residents
of
marion
county,
indiana.
marion
county
is
one
of
92
counties
in
indiana.
the
plaintiffs
below
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
marion
county
multi-member
districting
scheme.
marion
county
provides
for
the
at
large
election
of
15
members
of
the
house
representatives
and
8
members
of
the
senate.
this
action
does
not
involve
congressional
districting,
is
limited
solely
to
state
legislative
districts.
following
this
court's
decision
in
baker
v.
carr,
indiana
began
the
long
road
to
reapportionment.
in
1963,
it
reapportioned,
in
1965
it
again
reapportioned.
the
1965
act
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court
in
the
case
of
stout
v.
bottorff,
that's
the
first
district
court
case.
a
special
session
of
the
65
legislature
was
called,
and
they
again
enacted
an
apportionment
act,
that
was
the
apportionment
act
of
1965
and
that
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
was
the
member
of
the
1965
legislature,
that
enacted
the
1965
act,
that
he
voted
for
that
act
and
that
he
now
attacks
that
act.
there
were
six
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below,
one
was
a
resident
of
the
lake
county,
another
county
in
indiana,
five
of
the
plaintiffs
were
residents
of
marion
county.
the
district
court
found
in
favor
of
only
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
from
marion
county,
only
one
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
found
by
the
district
court
being
entitled
to
relief.
that
was
mason
bryant,
mason
bryant
was
the
resident
of
an
area,
within
marion
county,
which
the
district
court
denominated
as
the
center
township
ghetto.
he
was
the
resident
and
voter
of
the
center
township
ghetto.
the
center
township
is
one
of
the
nine
townships
of
marion
county.
it's
approximately
in
the
center
of
the
county,
the
other
townships
are
ranged
around
it.
the
center
township
ghetto
is
approximately
the
northern
half
of
the
center
township.
the
area
designated
by
the
court
as
the
ghetto
is
predominantly
populated
by
negroes
who
are
poor
and
less
well
educated
from
the
rest
of
the
county.
i
might
point
out
that
the
term
ghetto
is
the
term
used
by
the
appellees
and
by
the
district
court.
the
area
to
which
this
refers
is
not
regarded
in
the
community
as
a
ghetto,
it's
not
called
that
in
the
community
and
to
a
certain
extent
it's
non-descriptive
of
the
area
involved.
from
the
rest
of
the
county,
the
district
court
selected
an
area,
washington
township
and
compared
the
number
of
legislators
who
were
residents
of
washington
township
to
the
member
of
legislators
who
were
residents
of
the
center
township
ghetto.
an
absolute
numbers
are
washington
township
had
more
senators
than
the
center
township
negroes.
the
court
computed
ratios
and
found
that
washington
township
ratio
was
greater
from
the
center
township
ratio.
on
this
basis
the
district
court
declared
that
the
vote
of
the
center
township
negroes
was
diluted
and
canceled
out
by
the
marion
county
multi-member
district.
rather
than
limited
relief
to
merely
sub-districting
marion
county,
the
district
court
ordered
the
reapportionment
of
the
entire
state.
although,
the
court
appeared
to
rely
upon
a
straight
“one
man,
one
vote”
analysis
of
reynolds,
the
true
basis
for
requiring
the
reapportionment
of
the
entire
state
was
the
testimony
of
john
banzhaf.
john
banzhaf
is
an
associate
professor
of
law
at
george
washington
university
and
has
written
some
articles
regarding
multi-member
districts
and
testified
at
this
trial
at
the
hearing
to
this
case.
he
testified
that
apportionment
plans
providing
for
districts
of
different
sizes,
a
mix
system
of
multi-member
districts
and
single
member
districts,
created
inherent
inequities
and
was
unconstitutional
per
se.
on
this
basis
and
on
the
basis
of
clerical
considerations,
political
factors
which
the
district
court
found
to
exist
within
the
county,
the
district
court
required
that
when
the
state
reapportioned
that
all
districts
be
the
same
size.
on
july
28th
the
district
court
declared
the
1965
apportionment
act
unconstitutional
as
to
the
multi-member
districting
provisions
relating
to
marion
county.
the
district
court
gave
a
stay
till
october
1
to
reapportionment.
the
legislature
was
not
in
session
at
the
time
that
the
act
was
declared
unconstitutional.
we
had
at
that
time
biennial
sessions.
the
district
or
the
legislature
would
not
reconvene
until
january
1971,
accordingly
the
state
did
not
reapportioned.
on
october
15,
the
court
reconvened
and
invited
plans
from
the
parties,
the
plaintiffs,
the
defendants,
intervening
defendants,
legislative
leaders
and
interested
parties
in
general.
on
october
17,
the
district
court
announced
the
minimum
guidelines,
the
1960
census
data
would
be
used.
single
member
districts
would
be
preferred
over
multi-member
districts.
town,
county
and
township
lines
would
be
crossed
when
necessary,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
indiana
constitution
and
that
the
district
court
would
take
cognizance
of
the
existence
and
location
of
the
center
township
negroes.
the
plan
adapted
by
the
court
was
the
court's
plan
supplemented
by
the
plans
submitted
by
the
appellees
in
this
case.
the
appellees
submitted
a
plan
pertaining
only
to
marion
county.
the
court's
plans
as
adopted
did
rely
on
the
1960
census,
did
cross
some
county
and
township
lines,
did
take
cognizance
of
the
existence
and
location
of
the
center
township
negro
area.
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
this
regard
that
one
of
the
plans
submitted
by
the
intervening
defendants
had
variances
that
were
substantially
the
same
as
the
variances
in
the
plan
provided
by
the
appellees.
the
district
court
rejected
that
plan
because
in
its
estimation
it
did
not
take
cognizance
of
the
center
township
negro
area.
on
december
15,
the
district
court
announced
that
its
plan
would
be
the
plan,
would
be
the
apportionment
scheme
for
the
1970
election.
it
enjoined
all
state
election
officials
permanently
from
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
1965
act.
it
mandated
all
state
election
officials
to
conduct
the
1970
election
in
accordance
with
the
court's
plan.
furthermore,
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction,
permanent
jurisdiction
apparently
to
pass
on
any
future
claims
that
the
plaintiffs'
might
have
regarding
any
future
plan
of
apportionment
which
the
legislature
might
draft,
sort
of
a
super
legislative
veto.
the
state
of
indiana
appealed.
on
january
6,
the
governor
moved
the
district
court
to
stay
its
judgment.
the
district
court
refused.
the
state
on
january
20
--
the
next
day,
the
governor
applied
to
this
court
for
a
stay,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
and
on
february
2,
this
court
granted
the
governor's
application
for
a
stay.
the
1970
election
was
conducted
under
the
1965
act.
this
is
the
act
that
was
specifically
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
the
second
stout
case.
the
district
court
specifically
approved
the
constitutionality
of
that
act.
the
district
court
in
that
case
specifically
found
that
the
1965
act
met
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
turning
to
the
first
issue,
the
state
submits
that
constitution
does
not
in
fact
require
racial,
socioeconomic
groups
to
be
proportionally
represented
in
the
state
legislature
by
representatives
elected
from
that
ethnic
group.
the
district
court's
judgment
in
this
case
that
the
residents
of
the
center
township
area
--
that
the
vote
of
the
residents
of
the
center
township
area
was
canceled
out,
was
based
on
two
erroneous
assumptions.
first,
that
the
center
township
negro
area
was
proven
on
this
record
to
exist
as
a
distinct
from
cohesive
area
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
county.
the
second
erroneous
assumption
upon
which
the
district
court
based
its
judgment
is
that
fewer
legislative
persons
resided
in
the
center
township
area,
than
in
the
washington
township
area,
the
adjoining
area.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
that's
a
matter
of
some
speculation,
your
honor.
the
primary
holding
in
this
case
--
well,
first
of
all
you
have
the
district
court's
decision
in
1965
which
had
already
passed
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
1965
act
under
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
principles
of
reynolds.
now,
along
comes
this
case,
about
four
years
later.
the
court
looks
at
it
and
says,
well,
first
of
all
this
court
has
changed
the
standards,
secondly,
we
now
have
a
new
theory,
the
banzhaf
analysis
that
multi-member
and
single-member
districts
are
inherently
unconstitutional.
the
court
went
from
the
finding
that
these
defendants,
these
plaintiffs
were
invidiously
discriminated
against,
it
went
from
that
finding
to
the
conclusion
that
the
entire
state
had
to
be
reapportioned.
it
is
just
--
there
is
a
complete
gap
in
there
as
to
why
the
whole
state
had
to
be
reapportioned.
the
district
court
specifically
said
that
when
once
marion
county,
it
sub
districted,
there
would
be
unallowable
variances,
but
that's
patently
absurd.
either
it
was
malapportioned
--
well,
you
have
legislators
for
persons
in
there,
it's
going
to
be
the
same
after
you
reapportion
as
it
was
before,
either
it
was
okay
before
or
it
wasn't,
but
the
district
court
already
said
it
was.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
that's
exactly
the
way
they
went.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
explanation
of
what
happened.
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
that
would
have
been
a
reason
to
reapportion
the
entire
state.
that
would
not
have
been
a
reason
to
sub-district,
necessarily
a
reason
to
sub-district,
while
i
guess
it
follows
that
marion
county
would
have
to
be
sub-districted
because
it's
the
largest
district
in
the
state.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
one
of
the
problems
in
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
think
they
did,
i
think
they
did.
an
interesting
part
of
that
preposition
is
that
the
court
only
found
in
favor
of
mason
bryant
who
was
a
member
of
the
multi-member
district.
there
was
no
member
--
the
court
didn't,
if
the
court
is
going
to
find
that
someone's
rights
have
been
violated,
then
it
has
to
have
the
man
before
it
who's
right
has
been
violated.
mason
bryant
under
the
court's
analysis
was
over
represented.
the
court
had
no
one
--
well,
the
court
filed
in
favor
of
no
one
before
it
in
terms
of
having
being
under
represented,
the
court
went
both
ways.
in
the
invidious
discrimination
argument,
breaking
up
the
marion
county
district,
the
court
found
that
mason
bryant
was
under
represented.
applying
the
banzhaf
analysis,
the
court
found
that
marine
county
was
over
represented.
they
tried
to
have
it
both
ways.
to
reach
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
as
the
marine
county
multi-member
district,
it
had
to
first
find
--
first
had
to
section
off
a
distinct
area
then
had
to
compare
--
divide
some
meaningful
basis
to
compare
that
area
to
another
area.
to
do
that,
it
conducted
what
it
called
a
statistical
analysis,
which
i
won't
to
treat
here
because
i
feel
that
i
have
adequately
treated
it
in
brief,
but
i
feel
that
the
statistical
analysis
the
court
applied
amounts
to
gross
speculation,
that
the
center
township
negro
area
amounts
to
a
separate
distinct
area
within
the
county.
the
second
step
which
the
court
used
was
to
compare
the
ratios,
the
ratio
of
legislator
per
person
of
the
center
township
negro
area
to
the
washington
township
area.
to
do
this,
the
township
lines,
the
township
boundaries;
these
two
--
these
areas
that
are
being
compared
have
to
have
some
political
significance.
implied
in
the
court's
decision
is
that
somehow
legislate
--
residents
in
washington
township
are
better
represented,
but
a
legislator
from
washington
township
doesn't
represent
all
the
legislators
in
the
county,
but
somehow
he
only
represents
the
residents
in
washington
township.
somehow
the
residents
of
washington
township
are
specially
benefited
by
having
legislators
elected
from
there.
that
somehow
washington
township
legislators
did
not
represent
residents
of
the
center
township
negro
area.
the
record
refutes
those
conclusions.
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
in
this
case
mr.
chavis
was
a
resident
of
washington
township.
he
testified
that
when
he
was
in
the
legislature
he
represented
the
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
a
legislator
living
outside
of
the
center
township
negro
area
can
represent
the
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
in
that
regard,
your
honor?
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
your
honor.
not
at
all,
that
was
a
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
none.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no
discrimination,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
in
this
case,
mr.
chavis
testified,
that
in
these
two
areas
the
laws
were
perfectly
inadequate,
in
the
areas
of
welfare
and
unemployment
compensation.
he
said,
the
laws
are
adequate.
the
problem
is
with
the
attitudes
of
the
people
that
are
administering
those
laws.
that's
not
a
problem
of
discrimination.
that's
not
this
kind
of
problem
of
discrimination,
that's
another
kind
of
problem.
our
concern
here
is
whether
these
people
are
represented
in
the
legislature.
the
record
–-
okay
--
in
the
same
regard
chavis
also
testified
that
the
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes
were
shared
--
were
common
with
the
residents
of
the
rest
of
the
county,
with
the
residents
of
the
rest
of
the
state,
that's
it
was
counted
with
negroes
living
in
areas
outside
of
the
center
township
area.
the
significance
of
this
is
that,
if
the
interest
of
the
negroes
living
in
the
center
township
are
not
being
fully
pushed
along,
fully
been
taken
care
of,
that
neither
the
interest
of
citizens
in
other
areas
of
the
state.
in
the
same
regard,
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
indiana,
their
welfare
laws
--
we
also
have
consumer
protection
laws,
unemployment
compensation.
any
interest
that
you
can
think
of
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
claimed
they
had,
there
is
a
law
providing
for
that,
there
is
a
law
provided
for
that.
i
think
that's
an
example
of
the
fact
that
their
interests
have
not
been
ignored
in
the
legislature.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
the
district
court
says,
that
the
center
township
negroes
have
compelling
interests
in
things
like
urban
renewal,
and
welfare,
legislation,
law
and
order,
schooling,
education,
health,
so
on
and
so
forth.
these
were
the
compelling
interests
of
the
center
township
negroes.
they
are
piece
of
the
interest
that
we
share
with
those
people
in
common.
it's
an
interest
we
have
in
common.
and
there
are
laws
in
the
books
that
attempt
to
regulate
or
in
some
way
take
care
of
these
interests
and
i
think
this
an
example
of
fact
that
their
interest
are
not
ignored.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
sort
of
yes
and
no.
generally
speaking,
no
your
honor.
the
legislature
enacts
the
laws
and
they
are
carried
out
by
some
other
body.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
except
to
change
the
law.
they
did
first
state
out
a
point
the
department
has,
take
the
welfare
department,
look
how
that's
broken
down,
you
have
the
state
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
there
are
a
few
standing
committees,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
few,
very
few.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
okay.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
but
not
continuing
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
the
legislature
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
oh
yes!
definitely.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
fully
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
wouldn't
say
is
it's
the
difference,
your
honor,
i
would
say
it's
the
same
sort
of
control
that
congress
would
have,
only
probably
less
so
because
of
the
fact
that,
i
apparently
mean
(inaudible)
there
are
no,
there
are
a
few
standing
committees,
but
the
characteristics
between
the
two,
i
think
they
are
parallel.
one
other
example
of
fact
that
the,
one
other
fact
to
show
that
the
legislative
interest
of
the
center
township
negroes
are
not
ignored,
is
the
tax
money
that's
appropriated
for
the
very
things
that
the
district
court
said
they
were
most
interested
in;
urban
renewal,
schools,
education,
health,
welfare,
unemployment
compensation.
the
tax
money
that's
appropriated,
that
goes
into
this
areas
is
disproportionately
large
as
the
money
that's
going
into
the
rest
of
the
county.
the
remedy
correct
the
delusion
which
the
district
court
found
to
exist
in
marion
county
was
the
subdistrict
of
marion
county.
the
state
submits
that
this
a
retreat
to
the
separate
but
equal
doctrine
of
plessy
v.
ferguson.
in
requiring
that
the
districts
--
that
the
center
township
negro
areas
be
separately
districted,
district
court
was
saying,
let's
make
them
separate
but
equal.
if
it
is
--
if
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
allowed
to
stand,
districts
must
be
drawn
to
separate
and
segregate
citizens
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
economic
conditions,
and
other
special
interests.
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
to
carry
that
out
a
step
further
and
if
we
are
going
to
have
ethnic
or
proportional
representation,
perhaps
the
next
suit
will
be
a
suit
against
the
state
to
increase
the
size
of
its
legislature
so
that
these
interests
can
be
represented
with
some
degree
of
precision.
in
the
final
analysis,
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
special
interest
group.
the
center
township
negroes
in
this
case
claimed
to
have
special
interest.
well,
we
all
do.
as
a
lawyer
i
have
special
interest.
as
a
citizen
my
interest
may
differ
from
someone
else,
but
i
have
special
interest.
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion,
the
district
court
would
require
that
every
special
interest
have
its
own
representatives,
may
it
be
a
lawyer's
representative
or
a
school
representative.
heretofore
we
have
called
these
people
obvious
but
we
haven't
given
them
a
representative
to
represent
them
in
the
legislature.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
that
seems
--
for
marion
county
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
the
legislative
leaders
were
invited
to
submit
a
plan.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
they
were
given
several
days
in
which
to
do
that.
and
i
believe
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
pardon
me?
mr.
william
f.
thompson
several
days
and
i
believe
i
did
submit
a
plan.
as
a
matter
of
--
and
the
plaintiffs
were
in
invited,
the
plaintiffs
and
defendants
were
invited
to
submit
plans
to
the
district
court.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
no,
they
were
just
legislative
leaders.
that's
one
of
the
committees
or
--
i
can't
really
say
how
it
is
that
these
people
came
together
to
submit
this
plan,
but
they
did,
but
the
legislature
was
not
in
session.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
oh
yes!
quite
clear.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
as
the
action
started
out
it
was
initiated
against
all
the
legislators.
but
then
the
governor
was
added,
and
the
legislature
was
dropped
and
the
governor
was
left
in
the
action.
the
governor
is
the
only
defendant
appellant
now
left
in
this
action
on
behalf
of
the
state.
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
this
proportional
representation
issue,
the
designation
of
the
center
township
negro
area
implies
the
singling
out
on
the
basis
of
race
and
color.
you
can't
single
this
area
out
without
looking
at
the
race
of
the
people
living
there,
their
economic
condition
and
so
on.
separately
districting
marion
county
--
no
separately
districting
the
center
township
negroes
is
a
singling
on
the
basis
of
race
and
color.
you
can't
draw
the
lines
around
it
--
around
this
group,
unless
you
look
at
them
and
determine
in
advance
before
you
draw
those
lines
what
is
their
race,
what
is
their
color,
what
is
their
creed,
so
on
and
so
forth.
this
court
has
uniformly
condemned
all
such
attempts,
and
should
do
so
in
this
case
by
reversing
a
decision
on
the
district
court.
the
other
issue
i
want
to
hit
upon
briefly
is
the
banzhaf
issue,
the
striking
down,
finding
all
multi-member
districts
unconstitutional
per
se.
it
has
always
been
thought,
it's
been
implied
and
accepted
that
although
a
voter
in
a
multi-member
district
had
an
advantage
because
he
had
more
representatives
from
which
to
--for
whom
to
vote,
that
this
advantage
was
offset
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
part
of
the
larger
electorate
competing
with
him
to
vote
for
these
individuals.
this
has
been
challenged
by
john
banzhaf
and
others.
banzhaf
analysis
briefly
is
that
voters
in
the
marion
county
multi-member
district
were
over-represented
vis-à-vis
smaller
multi-member
districts
and
single
member-districts
within
the
state.
there
was
an
inherent
disparity
and
it
was
based
on
rather
complex
mathematical
equations
which
he
devised.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
this
that
the
court
required,
the
district
court
required
the
state
to
reapportion
the
entire
state.
the
problem
with
banzhaf's
theory
is
that
first
of
all
as
it
relates
to
this
case,
no
independent
study
was
made
of
indiana.
the
figures
and
maps,
exhibits,
and
so
on
and
so
forth
used
by
banzhaf
in
this
case
where
those
supplied
to
him
by
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
the
district
court,
in
its
december
15
order
retained
permanent
jurisdiction
of
case.
they
said
all
future
claims
by
these
plaintiffs
against
all
future
legislative
acts,
that's
number
one.
number
two,
65
--
the
state
has
been
permanently
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
1965
act.
as
a
technical
matter,
that's
the
only
apportionment
act
we
have
at
this
time.
well
legislation
-
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
would
not
--
i
wouldn't
expect.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
would
not
expect
one,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no
your
honor,
i
definitely
don't
think.
the
legislature,
because
of
this
decision
in
the
district
court,
the
legislature
is,
to
use
a
phrase
under
the
gun,
they
have
to
break
up
the
marion
county
multi-member
district.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
pardon
me.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
why
would
they?
mr.
william
f.
thompson
your
honor,
it's
a
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
because
they
could
very
well
expect
the
plaintiffs
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
the
very
same
district
court
obtain
the
very
same
thing,
that
they
have
obtained
in
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
your
honor,
in
the
state's
view
of
it,
the
record
in
this
case
was
so
thin
that
if
i
could
do
that
on
that,
they
could
do
it
on
anything.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
would
you
repeat
that
please
your
honor?
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well
the
constitution
as
interrupted
by
this
court
in
reynolds
where
this
court
says
that
decennial
reapportionment
ought
to
be
adequate,
constitutional
decennial
reapportionment
ought
to
be
adequate.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
that's
congressional
districts.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
congressional
districts
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
but
i
don't
think
that
pertains
to
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
i
cannot
answer
that
question
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
what
the
state
constitution
provides
in
that
respect.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well
no,
in
a
sense
of
being
bound,
they
would
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
but
as
a
practical
matter
your
honor,
the
state
can
expect
to
be
back
in
court
on
the
same
issues,
the
same
district
court
on
the
same
issues
and
if
they
don't
--
if
they
provide
essentially
same
plan,
complying
with
reynolds
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
i
would
like
to
think
your
honor
we
would
not
be
back
in
court
on
banzhaf's
analysis
and
separately
districting
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
we've
just
had
an
election
for
the
legislature
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
the
next
one
is
1970,
1972
sure.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
this
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
let
me
say
this
your
honor.
the
legislature
means
in
january
of
1971.
this
action
was
started
in
january
1969,
and
to
conduct
a
1970
election
we
had
to
get
stay,
so
that
if
we
were
to
–
if
the
court
were
to
say
we
would
be
back
to
where
we
were
two
years
from
now
we
will
be
back
on
the
same
problem.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
right
your
honor,
we
don't
know.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
no,
i
don't
–
it's
my
position
–
it's
state’s
position
if
the
case
is
submitted.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
yes
your
honor,
and
then
we
would
have
to
--
if
this
court
didn't
decide
these
issues.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
the
district
court
said
it
would
in
it’s
december
15
order
--
mr.
william
f.
thompson
well,
your
honor
as
the
state
interprets
--
as
the
state
interprets
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
multi-member
district
in
marion
county
is
okay.
it
meets
constitutional
muster
and
that
districts
of
different
sizes
within
the
state
meets
constitutional
muster,
but
that's
not
what
the
district
court
says.
mr.
william
f.
thompson
the
point
that
this
court
says
vacates
or
decides
the
case
as
moot
has
no
significance.
