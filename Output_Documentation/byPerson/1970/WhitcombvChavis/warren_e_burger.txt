mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
say
that
the
control
was
of
different
kind,
or
of
different
character
that
than
control
that
congress
exercises
over
the
execution
of
laws.
i'm
trying
to
get
the
general
point
of
view.
different
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
the
legislatures
that
you
refer
to
parties
to
the
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
--
the
record
is
perfect
and
clear
as
if
they
were
not
parties
to
this
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
they
ordered
or
requested
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
consumed
now,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
manahan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
lawsuit
had
not
been
pending,
what
would
--
impact
would
the
1970
census
have
had
on
the
state
of
indiana
in
the
apportionment
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
court
decide
that
it
should
have
this
accelerated
reapportionment,
what
was
the
date?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
speaking
of
this
court's
stay
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
the
district
court.
what
do
you
suggest
led
the
district
court
to
try
to
reapportion
the
state
of
indiana,
6
months
or
so
before
it
was
going
to
began
on
the
normal
schedule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
at
any
rate
they
were
quite
close
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
mean
by
that,
that
in
such
districts
they
must
have
single
representatives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
want
to
see
how
far
this
goes.
suppose
you
have
an
area
where
it
was
demonstrated
that
an
area
just
is
big
as
the
one
you
have
here,
same
size,
same
shape.
same
people
who
were
preserving,
let
is
say
germanic
culture,
essentially
spoke
german,
they
had
bilingual
services
in
churches,
both
catholic
and
protestant
and
preserve
many,
many
indicia
of
their
own
tradition
and
culture.
would
this
court's
orders
say
that
they
must
(inaudible)
around
these
people
of
germanic
origins
and
let
them
elect
their
separate
representative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what's
it's
based
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
distinguish
that
from
there
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
smaller
district
--
is
the
smaller
district
drawn
to
identify
a
particular
group?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
fully
consumed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legislature
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
blacks
and
before
it
–
if
we
should
vacate,
set
aside
as
moot,
then
what
the
district
court
is
said
it
is
not
very
relevant
to
anything,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all.

you
