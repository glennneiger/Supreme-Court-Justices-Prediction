justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
that
--
overall
that
is
the
forgetting
the
single
multi-member
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
only
the
more
representatives
from
marion
county
than
they
were
entitled
to
on
the
basis
of
proper
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
legislatives
are
sometimes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
to
say
that
what
you
have
just
been
showing
us
in
those
squares,
there
may
or
may
not
be
multi-member
representatives
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
it
permit
or
not
multi-member
representation
in
those
squares?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
must
all
be
singles,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
at
presently
under
this
judgment,
in
marion
county,
they
are
all
single-membered
districts,
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
to
say,
under
the
court's
plan
they
would
have
to
be
single-membered
districts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
reason
that
wasn't
effective
for
the
last
november
election
is
our
stay,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
is
there
about
the
court's
judgment
setting
up
single-member
districts
in
marion
county
under
that
claim
which
means
that
the
legislature
may
not
setup
multi-member
districts
in
marion
county
in
the
1970
reapportionment?
what
in
the
district
court's
judgment
prevents
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
wouldn't
there
have
to
be
a
brand
new
case?
i
gather
you
brought
the
whole
case
under
fortson
and
burns
on
the
ground
that
multi-member
districting
in
marion
county
at
least
was
operating
in
a
manner
that
minimized
or
canceled
out
the
voting
strength
of
a
racial
group,
wasn't
that
primarily
the
--
?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
only
theory,
alright.
and
you
prevailed
(inaudible)
and
that's
why
you
got
the
the
ruling
that
you
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
mean,
and
now
you’ve
got
a
lot
more
i
guess
than
you’ve
asked
for,
but
the
point
is,
and
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to,
what
is
there
about
that
determination
as
it
related
to
the
1960
and
1965
figures
to
try
the
case
which
means
that
there
is
any
obstacle
whatever
that
a
indiana
legislature
reapportioning
under
a
plan
precisely
like
that
one
which
in
this
instance
for
marion
county
at
least,
the
district
court
struck
down.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
it's
not
the
factual
record,
it’s
the
banzhaf
theory,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
at
that
time,
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
who
is
to
know
that
will
be
so
under
the
new
--
under
the
reapportionment
based
on
the
1970
census?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
there
a
whole
new
ball
game
on
reapportionment
in
indiana
and
every
other
state
based
on
the
1970
census?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
include
the
rest
of
the
state?
what
happens
to
the
rest
of
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
again
mr.
manahan,
i
gather
under
the
court's
plan
and
say
each
of
those
sub-districts
would
have
had,
but
one
white
senator.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
in
the
senates
case,
there
are
what
districts
with
multi
with
multi
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
one
senator.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
forgive
my
confusion.
you've
got
two
houses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
under
the
court's
plan
is
to
be
the
representation
in
every
instance
a
senatorial
district
has
but
one
senator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
every
instance,
what's
your
lower
house
called?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
house
of
representatives,
every
district
has
but
one
representative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
there
is
only
one
senator
--
which
means
if
we
were
to
affirm
what
the
district
court
did
then
is
it
your
position
that
for
the
1970
reapportionment,
there
could
be
no
compliance
whatever
with
the
indiana
constitution
provision
for
multi-member
districts
either
in
the
house
of
representatives
or
in
the
senate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
with
the
respect
to
the
house
of
representatives?
could
there
on
--
if
we
affirm,
could
there
be
throughout
the
state
in
the
1970
reapportionment
any
multi-member
districts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
which
you
mean
that
--
it
might
be
a
number
of
multi-member
districts
if
the
multi-membership
means
two
or
three,
they
all
have
to
be
two
or
three
in
every
district?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
when
they
came
to
constructive
plan
of
their
own,
it
was
all
single-member.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
maybe
a
good
reason,
but
the
fact
is
you
are
suggesting
that
the
holding
was
that
if
i
get
what
you
just
said,
the
legislature
is
still
free
to
construct
multi-member
districts
so
long
as
there
are
a
smaller
number
of
members
in
each
district?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
throughout
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
they
came
around
however
constructing
their
own
plan
and
for
marion
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
single-member
districts
under
the
court
plan
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
there
is
an
explanation
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
what
you
relied
on
was,
i
forgot,
forstson
or
burns.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
said
either
decidedly
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
otherwise,
having
that
effect,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
you
tried
to
prove
decidedly
but
you
didn't
succeed,
but
it
doesn't
matter
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think,
you
think
however
we
decide
this
case,
the
state
is
going
to
be
out
in
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
is
the
next
election
--
next
legislative
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
talking
about
the
next
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
have
got
ample
time
to
have
a
new
apportionment
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
legislature
has
been
very
good
to
agreeing
on
one,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
the
same
or
some
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
legislature
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
that
--
