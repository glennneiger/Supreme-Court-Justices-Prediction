justice

black
what
is
city
in

lake
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
point
is
without
a
federal
decree
back
on
the
indiana
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
indiana
constitution,
the
evil
would
be
difficult
--
three-judge
district
court
found
to
exist
would
be
repeated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
only
a
federal
decree
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
what
the
federal
decree
does
is
to
preserve
the
ground
rules
for
the
“one
man-one
vote”
principle
in
this
setting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
a
reapportionment,
then
we
would
have
to
set
aside,
just
vacate
it
as
moot,
and
wipe
it
off
the
book,
why
would
the
legislature
be
hampered
in
its
reapportionment
on
1970
census?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
might
attack
it,
but
they
might
not
succeed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
how
this
judgment
of
court
in
this
particular
reapportionment
(inaudible)
the
constitutional
requirement
for
reapportionment
every
10
years,
by
the
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
understand
it,
constitution
requires
reapportionment,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
isn't
it
required
in
the
constitution
that
there
be
reapportionment
based
on
each
census?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

reapportionment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
assume
whatever
it
is,
if
we
were
set
this
aside,
i
don't
say
we
are
sure
that
we
will,
if
we
have
to
set
aside
as
moot,
making
judgment,
the
legislature
wouldn’t
be
bound
by
the
court’s
holding
with
reference
to
a
future
apportionment,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
give
somebody
an
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
somebody
might.
(inaudible)
don't
know
what
the
legislature
is
going
to
do
on
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
a
different
case,
they
might
never
bring
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
imagine
legislature
knows
enough
about
that
to
try
in
some
way
to
wipe
out
the
alleged
inefficiency
and
defects
in
the
reapportionment.
