justice

white
i
thought
the
court
would
have
reached
the
same
result
and
redistrict
the
whole
state
even
if
it
had
not
found
that
looking
at
marion
county
alone,
that
the
multi-member
district
canceled
out
to
voting
power
of
some
group.
i
thought
the
court
would
have
said
that,
the
multi-member
districts
as
multi-member
districts
give
multi-member
districts
too
much
power
compared
to
single-member
district.
so,
they
could
have
reached
this
reapportioning
the
whole
state
result,
without
identifying
any
particular
group
within
marion
county
as
having
been
disenfranchised?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
multi-member
districts
would
have
had
to
–
(voice
overlap)
upon.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
go
that
route
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
anybody
be
violating
any
court
injunction
if
it
--
if
he
enforced
or
he
passed
or
enforced
a
multi-member
districting
system
in
marion
county
under
the
new
census?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
just
saying
that
in
the
face
of
this
judgment,
in
the
face
of
this
decision
legislators
just
won't
establish
a
multi-member
district
in
marion
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
will
legislators
or
will
they
not
feel
bound
by
this
decision
not
to
establish
a
multi-member
house
district
in
marion
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
can
still
have
some
single-member
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
couldn't
have
any
single-member
district
(inaudible)
multi-member
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
held
that
the
only
practical
remedy
for
the
unconstitutional
deprivation
that
is
found
in
marion
county
was
to
create
single-member
districts
in
marion
county.
so
that's
a
narrow
for
the
future
that
this
is
the
only
constitutional
way
of
distributing
marion
county.
justice
byron

i
am

from
the

that
is
the
present
--
under
the
present
the
indiana
apportionment
statute,
deprive
this
group,
the
ghetto
area
people
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
it
says
hence
those
apportionment
--
the
present
legislative
apportionment
statute
related
to
marion
county
as
to
both
senate
and
house
are
unconstitutional
and
void.
the
court
finds
that
the
only
practical
remedy
for
such
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
voting
strength
is
the
elimination
of
the
large
multi-member
house
or
senate
districts
in

justice
byron
r.

now
what
do
you
expect
in

case?
justice

and
he
goes
on
and
says
that
there
should
be
single-member
districts.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
poor
blacks
or
the
poor
generally
in
indianapolis
was
scattered
evenly
throughout
the
city
you
would
have
no
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
would
nevertheless
have
all
the
same
interests
that
they
now
have.
the
only
thing
is
there
wouldn't
be
anything
to
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
their
other
interest
may
not
be
affected,
i
mean,
may
not
--
their
interest
wouldn't
be
any
more
effectively
represented
than
they
are
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
court

have
