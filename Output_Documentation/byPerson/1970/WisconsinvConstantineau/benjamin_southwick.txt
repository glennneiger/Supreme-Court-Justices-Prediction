mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
benjamin
southwick
and
i’m
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
i
am
here
today
representing
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
this
case
which
came
up
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
panel
in
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
a
certain
sections
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment,
meet
the
requirements
of
procedural
due
process.
the
lower
court
decided
this
question
in
a
two
to
one
decision
against
the
state,
that
the
statutes
were
in
fact
unconstitutional
with
a
dissent
by
the
united
states
senior
circuit
judge
f.
ryan
duffy.
these
statutes
which
are
sections
176.26
and
176.28
sub
(1)
of
the
wisconsin
statute
state
which
are
set
forth
in
pages
116
and
117
of
the
appendix,
state
in
essence
that
a
series
of
local
officials
including
the
wife
of
any
individual
and
including
the
chief
of
police
of
any
city
that
these
series
of
local
official
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statute,
when
they
make
a
finding
according
to
certain
standards
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statutes
and
these
standards
essentially
relate
to
the
exposing
of
an
individual
to
or
his
family
to
want
or
the
town
or
village
in
which
he
lives
to
liability
for
a
support
or
the
injuring
of
the
individual's
health
or
the
endangering
of
the
personal
safety
and
comfort
of
any
member
of
his
family
or
the
endangering
the
security
of
the
property
of
any
person
or
becoming
dangerous
to
the
peace
of
a
community.
when
any
of
these
local
officials
including
the
wife
of
an
individual
make
a
finding
and
this
finding
is
made
without
notice
of
intention
to
make
it
and
without
a
hearing,
when
these
standards
are
met,
then
these
empowered
local
officials
can
send
a
notice
to
the
effect
to
any
person
and
is
normally
persons
within
their
jurisdiction
that
the
person
against
whom
this
standard
is
found
is
forbidden
to
purchase
alcoholic
beverages
or
to
be
given
alcoholic
beverages
for
a
period
of
one
year
and
all
the
statute
provides
that
a
copy
of
this
notice
shall
be
sent
to
the
person
who
has
been
what
we
call
posted
and
the
punitive
section
176.28
sub
(1)
provides
that
any
person
who
knowingly
serves
an
individual
alcoholic
beverages
who
has
been
self
posted
shall
be
subjected
to
certain
criminal
penalties.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
not
under
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
there
maybe
some
problems
with
that
but
i
don’t
believe
that
they’re
present
in
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
i’m
not
well
--
terribly
well
versed
in
other
aspects
of
the
wisconsin
regulation.
i
thought
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
believe
that
imposes
liability
on
a
bartender?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it’s
my
opinion
that
wisconsin
mr.
justice
blackmun
does
not
have
such
a
statute.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes.
this
case
arose
if
i
may
continue
until
--
did
i
hear
another
question
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
findings
are
not
set
forth,
no.
there’s
no
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
although
the
deposition
was
taken
later
on
of
the
lady,
the
appellee
mrs.
constantineau
who
was
a
--
who
these
standards
were
found.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct.
he
makes
them
in
his
own
mind
because
he
doesn’t
have
to
and
this
is
a
problem
in
the
case
before
the
court.
there
is
no
provision
for
a
hearing
or
for
any
saying
forth
that
the
standards
were
found.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
he
made
the
finding
in
the
sense
that
he
did
issue
notice
to
the
bartenders
in
the
city
of
hartford,
wisconsin.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
the
case
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
beg
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
i
think
a
very
legitimate
one
which
is
to
regulate
and
to
delimit
the
noxious
effects
which
alcoholic
beverages
can
have
upon
individuals.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
certainly
say
that
that’s
case
mr.
justice
blackmun,
certainly
of
his
family
and
of
the
community
in
which
he
resides
as
well.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
have
set
them
forth
in
the
appendix
(e)
of
my
jurisdictional
statement
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
15
other
states
which
have
a
similar
statute
which
do
not
provide
as
this
case
does
not
--
this
statute
in
wisconsin
does
not
provide
for
a
hearing
or
notice
of
intention
posed
to
the
individual.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
local
official
in
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
chief
of
police
made
the
finding
and
as
i
say
in
his
own
mind
he
made
the
finding
which
is
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
--
which
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
sent
the
notice
out
to
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct
yes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
that
is
the
posting
and
i
think
the
word
posting
is
used
is
the
sense
of
a
mailing
perhaps
and
not
in
the
sense
of
posting
on
a
bulletin
board
which
is
the
point
i
hope
to
get
to
later.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
recipient
gets
it
contemporaneously
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
--
with
all
of
the
bartenders
and
of
all
owners.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
no
there
are
no
criminal
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
no
criminal
penalty
or
whatsoever
against
the
person
who
has
been
posted
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief
and
as
the
statutes
from
the
other
state
set
forth
in
jurisdictional
statement
indicate
that
some
of
the
other
states
do
provide
criminal
penalties
for
the
person
posted
but
the
wisconsin
statute
is
not
of
this
nature.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it
appears,
no,
it
does
not
appear
mr.
justice
brennan
although
the
facts
and
the
nature
of
the
various
circumstances
do
appear
in
the
record
in
a
deposition
which
was
taken
after
this.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
in
the
record
yes
but
it
has
not
been
reprinted
in
the
appendix
and
i
beg
the
court’s
pardon
for
that
over
say,
a
certain
portion
of
it.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
what
can
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
he
has
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
he
has
numerous
alternatives
if
the
--
mr.
justice
marshall
suggest
there
is
a
tea-toddler
he
can
bring
out
an
action
as
mrs.
constantineau
has
done
against
the
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
in
the
federal
courts
or
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there
is
no
machinery
in
the
statute
for
any
sort
of
hearing
and
this
of
course
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
the
two
judges
in
the
fellow
district
found
a
way
of
doing
it
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
factitious
mr.
justice
marshall
when
i
say
that
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
un-posting
someone.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it
is
not
at
all
by
stated
in
the
statute
mr.
justice
marshall
what
the
person
received
and
what
he
should
do
with
it
and
of
course
this
is
the
point
i
intend
to
make
that
the
statute
is
a
not
on
their
face
un-constitutional
because
they
don't
provide,
they
merely
provide
for
this
notice
to
go
to
the
various
bartenders
and
not
that
they
set
them
up
on
the
wall
or
that
they
publish
them
in
any
way.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
absolutely.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
vigorously
contest
the
assumption
of
the
question
mr.
justice
marshall
that
it
is
put
up
somewhere,
the
statutes
don’t
provide
as
i
said
earlier
that
this
be
published
at
all
that
merely
sent
for
the
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there’s
no
protection.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there’s
no
protection
in
the
statute
against
the
arbitrary.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
he
is
in
trouble
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
--
in
the
sense
that
the
he
could
be
posted
by
the
wife
that’s
correct,
but
the
situation
of
the
wife
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
there
is
a
problem
in
the
statute
i
think
although
one
not
raised
by
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
wife
is
given
powers
which
the
husband
is
not
but
i
don’t
think
along
a
similar
vein
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
concept
of
empowering
a
private
individual
is
--
is
at
all
unique
in
this
situation
in
the
whole
area
of
the
state's
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages
and
i
cite
the
example
of
a
bartender
is
forced
to
make
a
determination
that
an
individual
is
of
sufficient
age
to
drink,
that
he’s
21
years
old
or
in
the
case
of
the
dram
shop
act
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
bartender
is
given,
the
onus
of
making
the
decisions
of
whether
somebody
is
intoxicated
or
not,
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
delegation
to
private
individuals
in
this
whole
area
of
law
regulating
in
the
field
of
alcohol
beverages
is
because
these
private
individual
are
often
the
people
who
are
closest
to
the
problems
and
to
the
situations
involved
and
this
of
course
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
i
think
this
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
think
in
the
cases
i
really
had
to
anticipated
arguing
this
case
purely
from
the
analysis
of
looking
at
it
in
terms
of
the
so
called
right
to
obtain
alcoholic
beverages
because
i
think
that
is
a
very
minimal
right
and
i
think
the
states
have
it
to
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it
certainly
can
be
greatly
controlled
because
i
think
the
states
have
a
great
amount
of
power
in
these
areas
especially
since
the
passage
of
the
21st
amendment.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
by
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct
but
i
will
point
out
that
this
is
not
as
discretionary
will
of
court
to
grant
such
a
review.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i’ve
never
heard
of
any
litigation
under
the
statute
prior
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
no.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
and
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
certainly
true
mr.
justice
white,
that’s
--
and
of
course
the
appellee
in
this
case
has
chosen
federal
court.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
more
effective,
yes,
and
of
course
the
appellee
mrs.
constantineau
in
this
case
has
chosen
the
federal
form
but
she
could
as
well
chosen
the
state
form
and
i
don’t
think
the
statute
can
contemplate
really
any
arbitrary
of
malicious
activity
by
a
local
officials
or
by
a
wife
under
the
statute.
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
of
such
activity
could
occur
as
to
point
to
make
this
statute
into
a
constitution.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
what
the
court
said
mr.
justice
marshall,
yes.
of
course,
what’s
happened
in
this
case
is
that
mrs.
constantineau
has
been
posted
by
the
chief
of
police
for
the
state
of
the
city
of
hartford,
wisconsin.
mrs.
constantineau
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
court
alleging
two
causes
of
action
and
the
first
cause
of
action
which
was
against
the
chief
of
police
for
acting
maliciously
and
arbitrarily.
this
was
the
cause
of
action
in
which
she
mentioned
and
discussed
her
right
of
reputation
and
a
right
to
be
free
from
public
defamation
and
the
second
cause
of
action
which
is
the
cause
of
action
before
this
court
in
which
she
sought
an
junction,
the
right
of
reputation
was
never
mentioned,
the
right
to
be
free
from
public
defamation.
the
state
made
motions
to
separate
the
two
causes
of
action
and
to
intervene
as
a
party
defendant
and
the
motions
were
granted
and
at
the
hearing
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
counsel
for
mrs.
constantineau
never
mentioned
the
right
of
mrs.
constantineau
to
be
free
from
public
defamation
and
to
be
free
any
reputation
and
the
state
sought
to
produce
witnesses
on
this
point
and
subpoenaed
mrs.
constantineau
as
the
record
shows
but
judge
reynolds
of
the
majority
in
the
lower
court
refused
the
motion
of
the
state
to
produce
witnesses
and
in
the
questioning
which
appears
in
the
appendix
of
page
113
of
judge
reynolds
of
the
majority
in
the
lower
court,
myself
who
was
representing
the
state,
judge
reynolds
said
the
fact
and
“the
fact
of
being
held
up
to
ridicule
for
reasons
which
the
party
may
not
have
any
--
may
not
know
why”.
i
think
that
is
the
right
which
has
not
been
mentioned
which
bothers
me
more
than
anything
else
in
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
that’s
exactly
my
point
in
this
court
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
there’s
nothing
publicly
defamatory
about
the
actions
which
can
be
taken
under
the
statute
and
that
this
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
all
of
the
notice
says
and
it
does
appear
in
the
record,
all
of
the
notice
says
and
i
quote
from
the
one
sentence
of
the
notice
“you
are
hereby
forbidden
to
sale,
and
so
--
i'm
sorry
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
chief
justice,
to
sale
and
give
away
to
grace
norma
constantineau
any
intoxicating
liquors
or
whatsoever
kind
for
a
period
of
one
year
from
date
under
pane
of
the
penalty
set
forth
in
the
various
sections
and
that
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
the
punitive
section
which
applies
to
the
recipient
of
a
notice,
the
punitive
section
is
not
set
forth
in
the
notice
or
at
least
it
was
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
know
whether
there
would
be
a
--
(inaudible)
on
my
part
and
as
to
whether
a
bartender
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
would
be
familiar
with
the
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
sales
into
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it’s
my
contention
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
that
these
statutes
are
familiarly
known
in
wisconsin
as
the
alcoholic
posting
statutes
and
i
think
posting
could
mean
mailing
as
opposed
to
posting
in
a
bulletin
board
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
because
the
chief
of
police
could
easily
serve
as
notice
by
mail
i
would
think
on
the
various
bartenders
and
there’s
no
point
in
the
statutes
in
which
there
is
a
requirement
that
they
be
put
up
on
the
bulletin
board.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
she
is
subjected
only
in
the
statutes
to
receiving
a
notice
contemporaneously
with
the
bartenders
receiving
the
same
notice.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
the
lower
court
ordered
that
the
notice
is
to
be
retracted
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
mrs.
constantineau,
mr.
chief
justice
chose
the
federal
form
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
no
mr.
chief
justice,
not
to
my
knowledge.
she
chose
the
federal
form
and
brought
the
two
causes
of
action,
one
for
an
injunction
which
is
the
cause
of
action
here
and
the
first
cause
of
action
is
still
pending
for
damages
in
the
eastern
district.
the
majority
in
the
lower
court
in
both
sides
in
lower
court
took
the
so-called
balancing
test
approach
to
this
case
which
starts
with
the
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee.
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
concurring
opinion
and
the
later
cases
of
cafeteria
workers
versus
mcelroy
and
goldberg
versus
kelly
took
this
approach
of
balance
in
determining
the
requirements
of
due
process
to
any
given
situation
of
balancing
the
interest
of
government
under
on
the
hand
and
the
interest
of
the
individual
on
the
other
hand
and
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
the
lower
court
agreed
that
when
we
look
at
this
case
solely
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
alcoholic
beverages,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
agreed
that
clearly
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
the
due
process
did
not
require
any
notice
in
hearing
but
the
majority
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
of
the
appendix
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
use
it
--
and
they
are
familiar,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
because
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
these
statutes
are
referred
to
as
the
alcoholic
posting
statute
and
i
don’t
think
i
was
thinking
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
assume
that’s
the
only
explanation.
that’s
the
only
explanation
i
would
offer
to
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
certainly
not
mr.
justice
white,
certainly
not.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
this
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
true
but
another
section
of
the
statute
do
provide
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
statutes
can
be
renewed
for
an
additional
year.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
but
of
course
the
state
is
concerned
with
the
holding
of
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
not
say,
not
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
because
i
think
under
the
statute
this
lady
could
be
reposted
for
any
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
but
the
statutory
scheme
would
still
be
up.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
but
he
still
could
under
the
statute
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
oh
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
its
my
contention
in
the
lower
court
that
she
was
perfectly
free
to
buy
them
other
than
in
the
city
of
hardston
(voice
overlap).
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
i’ve
just
been
frustrated
mr.
justice
brennan
in
my
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct,
yes,
that
order
is
a
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
yes
and
the
order
appears
on
page
124
of
the
appendix.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
lower
court
found
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
have
said
that
he
enjoin
in
--
if
he
posted
anyone
else
that
he
would
be,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it’s
my
contention
if
it
pleases
the
court,
in
this
court
and
in
the
lower
court
that
the
whole
question
of
the
right
of
reputation
to
be
free
from
public
defamation
was
never
--
is
not
present
in
this
balancing
process
between
the
rights
and
interest
of
the
government
on
the
one
hand
and
the
interest
of
the
individual
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
only
finding
that
we
have
in
the
lower
court
is
the
statement
of
judge
reynolds
of
the
majority
in
the
lower
opinion
when
he
says
the
and
i
quote
from
page
119
of
the
appendix
“it
would
be
naïve
not
to
recognize
that
such
posting
or
characterization
of
an
individual
expose
him
to
public
embarrassment
or
ridicule”,
so
that
despite
the
failure
in
this
cause
of
action
of
mrs.
constantineau
to
allege
any
damage
to
injury
as
a
cause
for
the
statutes
to
be
unconstitutional
on
their
face
and
despite
the
courts
forbidding
the
states
from
calling
any
witnesses
in
this
case,
the
judge
made
that
assumption
purely
on
his
own
that
it
would
be
naïve
and
if
the
submission
of
the
state
to
this
court
that
this
whole
question
of
reputation
in
not
present
in
the
operation
of
this
statute.
it’s
not
present
in
the
record
of
this
case
and
the
deposition
which
is
in
the
record
in
which
i
repeat,
i’m
embarrassed
to
say
it
was
not
reprinted
in
the
appendix
shows
that
the
only
point
to
which
mrs.
constantineau
was
hurt
in
the
reputation
was
a
statement
that
she
made
in
the
court
in
the
deposition
that
she
was
embarrassed
by
the
operation
of
the
statute
but
later
on
she
admits
that
she
didn’t
know
her
own
reputation
in
this
small
city
of
hartford
for
any
matter
except
that
she
knew
that
people
knew
that
she
drink
a
lot,
that’s
only
point
on
which
she
knew
what
her
reputation
was
in
the
city
and
she
didn’t
know
whether
it
changed
or
not
since
the
posting
and
so
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes
and
it’s
only
the
second
cause
of
action
which
is
before
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
against
the
chief
of
police
for
acting
arbitrarily
under
the
statute.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes.
reputation
was
mentioned
in
the
seventh
paragraph
of
the
first
cause
of
action.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct,
yes
that
cause
of
action
is
still
pending
in
the
eastern
district.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
the
court
had
to
find
some
interest
which
was
affected
in
order
to
find
the
statutes
unconstitutional
because
it’s
clear
that
if
we
look
at
this
solely
in
terms
of
the
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages,
the
statutes
are
constitutional.
so
the
state
of
the
court
had
to
come
up
with
something
and
i
came
up
with
this
point
of
reputation.
and
it’s
my
point
to
this
court,
the
state's
point,
that
this
right
to
represent
a
reputation
is
not
involved
in
this
--
in
the
operation
of
these
statutes
and
should
not
be
accounted
for
in
the
balancing
test.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
first
count
is
still
pending
in
the
courts,
yes
so
it's
my
point,
if
the
court
are
please
before
of
this
court
that
this
whole
point
of
reputation,
it
should
not
be
put
on
the
balancing
scale
of
due
process
if
you
please.
for
the
one
reason
that
is
not
involved
in
the
record
of
this
case
in
any
way
that
the
statutes
in
their
operation
by
their
own
terms
in
any
way
involve
in
the
right
of
reputation.
and
also
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
if
we
look
at
the
other
cases,
and
i
think
you
have
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
other
day
before
this
very
court
talking
about
reputation
in
here.
there
he
was
talking
about
a
case
where
the
man
had
been
severely
damaged.
there
has
been
no
concrete
showing
of
any
sort
that
the
economic
future
or
economic
interest
of
mrs.
constantineau
or
have
in
way
been
affected
by
the
operation
of
these
statutes
and
that
she
does
not
have
viable
economic
alternatives
after
as
a
result
and
after
the
posting
which
took
place
under
these
statutes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
i
think
wages
are
far
important
on
the
balancing
scale
of
the
prices.
that’s
my
point
mr.
justice
white.
if
we
look
at
this
balancing
scale
between
the
interest
of
the
government
and
the
interest
of
the
individual.
if
we
look
at
it
solely
in
terms
of
the
right
against
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
not
only
the
--
mr.
justice
white,
what
the
state
thinks
but
in
my
opinion,
what
the
other
interest
that
are
been
affected
in
the
other
cases
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
which
are
far
more
substantial
interest
than
it’s
involved
in
this
case,
in
the
right
to
obtain
alcoholic
beverages.
and
i
used
the
word
right,
the
so
called
right.
it’s
not
in
the
right
privilege
sense
that
i’m
using
it.
i
think
when
we
compare
the
balancing
in
this
case,
the
due
process
balancing
whether
due
process
balancing
which
has
occurred
in
other
cases
in
which
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
say
not
shoes
but
i
think
the
right.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
right
of
the
individual
to
obtain.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
--
in
this
case,
the
right
of
the
individual
to
obtain
the
alcoholic
beverages
has
traditionally
been
a
very
frail
one
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
then
we
have
to
go
through
the
balancing
process
all
over
again
i
think.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
all
i
think
the
state
has
a
much
diminished
power
to
regulate
shot
gun
shells
and
it
does,
mr.
justice
white,
that
it
does
to
regulate
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
i
think
each
commodity
would
have
to
go
through
this
balancing
test
itself.
and
i
couldn’t
say
whether
it’s
not
up
to
me
say
whether
an
alcoholic
beverages
are
more
less
important
than
shot
gun
shell
but
i
think
the
courts
here
and
the
law
traditionally,
especially
since
the
passage
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
shown,
that
the
right
of
the
individual
to
obtain
alcoholic
beverage
is
very
frail
right
and
that
if
we
look
at
these
statutes
purely
in
those
terms
then
clearly
even
the
majority
in
the
lower
court
agrees
it.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
couldn’t
find
any
cases
under
the
statute
in
this
state
or
in
the
other
states
which
we
should
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
due
process.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
not
to
my
familiarity
mr.
chief
justice,
no.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
if
we
look
in
terms
of
this
balancing
test
that
i’ve
been
talking
about,
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
it
so
great
in
the
area
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
the
past.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
think
that
the
--
mr.
chief
justice
please
the
other
cases
have
shown
that
to
be
the
case
at
all
that
and
i’ve
cited
cases
in
the
field
of
regulating
a
business
interest,
the
right
of
a
business
to
be
free
from
competition
and
the
right
of
public
employee
to
continue
in
the
job
and
the
right
of
a
public
employee
to
continue
in
the
job.
all
of
these
things,
all
of
these
interests
which
i
submit
to
the
court
are
much
more
significant
interest
that
are
involved
in
this
case
have
been
taken
away
without
notice
in
the
hearing.
and
i
think
there
are
rights
that
can
be
taken
away
without
a
notice
in
the
hearing.
and
this
brings
me
to
the
point
which
i
entered
the
brief
on.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
that
would
differ
from
this
instance
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
know
that
you
can
make
that
assumption
mr.
justice
marshall.
assuming
not
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
can
you
make
that
assumption.
the
statute
merely
says
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
assumingly,
it
would
only
be
for
the
reason
set
forth,
and
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
know
that
the
--
mr.
justice
marshall
that
a
publishing
takes
place
in
the
context
which
would
in
anyway
be
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know
that
the
notice
that’s
contemplated
by
these
statutes
in
any
way
provides
for
any
defamations
in
the
sense
that
it
merely
says
that
they
are
forbidden
to
sell
to
this
individual.
and
now
what
conclusions
or
recipient
might
draw
not
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i’m
not
familiar
with
any
litigations
in
wisconsin
about.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there
was
no
suggestion
made
to
the
court
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
that
the
statute
mr.
justice
harlan
by
its
terms
is
reasonably
unambiguous.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
motions
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
motions
to
dismiss
were
made
for
this
district.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
believe
it
was
articulated
in
that
way
although
there
are
–
i
have
only
been
counsel
for
one
of
the
two
causes
of
action
mr.
chief
justice.
i
see
that
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
thank
you
mr.
schapiro.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas
but
the
year
was
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
he
did
in
this
case
when
the
lower
court
ordered
him
to
but
whether
or
not
he
could,
the
statute
doesn’t
provide
any
mechanism
for
him
to
do
so.
if
it
was
it
would
be
in
his
own
discretion.
and
i
couldn’t
answer
the
question
further
now.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
benjamin
southwick
and
i’m
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
i
am
here
today
representing
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
this
case
which
came
up
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
panel
in
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
a
certain
sections
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment,
meet
the
requirements
of
procedural
due
process.
the
lower
court
decided
this
question
in
a
two
to
one
decision
against
the
state,
that
the
statutes
were
in
fact
unconstitutional
with
a
dissent
by
the
united
states
senior
circuit
judge
f.
ryan
duffy.
these
statutes
which
are
sections
176.26
and
176.28
sub
(1)
of
the
wisconsin
statute
state
which
are
set
forth
in
pages
116
and
117
of
the
appendix,
state
in
essence
that
a
series
of
local
officials
including
the
wife
of
any
individual
and
including
the
chief
of
police
of
any
city
that
these
series
of
local
official
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statute,
when
they
make
a
finding
according
to
certain
standards
which
are
set
forth
in
the
statutes
and
these
standards
essentially
relate
to
the
exposing
of
an
individual
to
or
his
family
to
want
or
the
town
or
village
in
which
he
lives
to
liability
for
a
support
or
the
injuring
of
the
individual's
health
or
the
endangering
of
the
personal
safety
and
comfort
of
any
member
of
his
family
or
the
endangering
the
security
of
the
property
of
any
person
or
becoming
dangerous
to
the
peace
of
a
community.
when
any
of
these
local
officials
including
the
wife
of
an
individual
make
a
finding
and
this
finding
is
made
without
notice
of
intention
to
make
it
and
without
a
hearing,
when
these
standards
are
met,
then
these
empowered
local
officials
can
send
a
notice
to
the
effect
to
any
person
and
is
normally
persons
within
their
jurisdiction
that
the
person
against
whom
this
standard
is
found
is
forbidden
to
purchase
alcoholic
beverages
or
to
be
given
alcoholic
beverages
for
a
period
of
one
year
and
all
the
statute
provides
that
a
copy
of
this
notice
shall
be
sent
to
the
person
who
has
been
what
we
call
posted
and
the
punitive
section
176.28
sub
(1)
provides
that
any
person
who
knowingly
serves
an
individual
alcoholic
beverages
who
has
been
self
posted
shall
be
subjected
to
certain
criminal
penalties.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
not
under
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
there
maybe
some
problems
with
that
but
i
don’t
believe
that
they’re
present
in
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
i’m
not
well
--
terribly
well
versed
in
other
aspects
of
the
wisconsin
regulation.
i
thought
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
believe
that
imposes
liability
on
a
bartender?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it’s
my
opinion
that
wisconsin
mr.
justice
blackmun
does
not
have
such
a
statute.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes.
this
case
arose
if
i
may
continue
until
--
did
i
hear
another
question
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
findings
are
not
set
forth,
no.
there’s
no
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
although
the
deposition
was
taken
later
on
of
the
lady,
the
appellee
mrs.
constantineau
who
was
a
--
who
these
standards
were
found.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct.
he
makes
them
in
his
own
mind
because
he
doesn’t
have
to
and
this
is
a
problem
in
the
case
before
the
court.
there
is
no
provision
for
a
hearing
or
for
any
saying
forth
that
the
standards
were
found.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
he
made
the
finding
in
the
sense
that
he
did
issue
notice
to
the
bartenders
in
the
city
of
hartford,
wisconsin.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
the
case
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
beg
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
i
think
a
very
legitimate
one
which
is
to
regulate
and
to
delimit
the
noxious
effects
which
alcoholic
beverages
can
have
upon
individuals.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
certainly
say
that
that’s
case
mr.
justice
blackmun,
certainly
of
his
family
and
of
the
community
in
which
he
resides
as
well.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
have
set
them
forth
in
the
appendix
(e)
of
my
jurisdictional
statement
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
15
other
states
which
have
a
similar
statute
which
do
not
provide
as
this
case
does
not
--
this
statute
in
wisconsin
does
not
provide
for
a
hearing
or
notice
of
intention
posed
to
the
individual.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
local
official
in
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
chief
of
police
made
the
finding
and
as
i
say
in
his
own
mind
he
made
the
finding
which
is
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
--
which
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
sent
the
notice
out
to
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct
yes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
that
is
the
posting
and
i
think
the
word
posting
is
used
is
the
sense
of
a
mailing
perhaps
and
not
in
the
sense
of
posting
on
a
bulletin
board
which
is
the
point
i
hope
to
get
to
later.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
recipient
gets
it
contemporaneously
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
--
with
all
of
the
bartenders
and
of
all
owners.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
no
there
are
no
criminal
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
no
criminal
penalty
or
whatsoever
against
the
person
who
has
been
posted
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief
and
as
the
statutes
from
the
other
state
set
forth
in
jurisdictional
statement
indicate
that
some
of
the
other
states
do
provide
criminal
penalties
for
the
person
posted
but
the
wisconsin
statute
is
not
of
this
nature.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it
appears,
no,
it
does
not
appear
mr.
justice
brennan
although
the
facts
and
the
nature
of
the
various
circumstances
do
appear
in
the
record
in
a
deposition
which
was
taken
after
this.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
in
the
record
yes
but
it
has
not
been
reprinted
in
the
appendix
and
i
beg
the
court’s
pardon
for
that
over
say,
a
certain
portion
of
it.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
what
can
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
he
has
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
he
has
numerous
alternatives
if
the
--
mr.
justice
marshall
suggest
there
is
a
tea-toddler
he
can
bring
out
an
action
as
mrs.
constantineau
has
done
against
the
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
in
the
federal
courts
or
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there
is
no
machinery
in
the
statute
for
any
sort
of
hearing
and
this
of
course
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
the
two
judges
in
the
fellow
district
found
a
way
of
doing
it
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
factitious
mr.
justice
marshall
when
i
say
that
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
un-posting
someone.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it
is
not
at
all
by
stated
in
the
statute
mr.
justice
marshall
what
the
person
received
and
what
he
should
do
with
it
and
of
course
this
is
the
point
i
intend
to
make
that
the
statute
is
a
not
on
their
face
un-constitutional
because
they
don't
provide,
they
merely
provide
for
this
notice
to
go
to
the
various
bartenders
and
not
that
they
set
them
up
on
the
wall
or
that
they
publish
them
in
any
way.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
absolutely.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
vigorously
contest
the
assumption
of
the
question
mr.
justice
marshall
that
it
is
put
up
somewhere,
the
statutes
don’t
provide
as
i
said
earlier
that
this
be
published
at
all
that
merely
sent
for
the
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there’s
no
protection.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there’s
no
protection
in
the
statute
against
the
arbitrary.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
he
is
in
trouble
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
--
in
the
sense
that
the
he
could
be
posted
by
the
wife
that’s
correct,
but
the
situation
of
the
wife
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
there
is
a
problem
in
the
statute
i
think
although
one
not
raised
by
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
wife
is
given
powers
which
the
husband
is
not
but
i
don’t
think
along
a
similar
vein
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
concept
of
empowering
a
private
individual
is
--
is
at
all
unique
in
this
situation
in
the
whole
area
of
the
state's
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages
and
i
cite
the
example
of
a
bartender
is
forced
to
make
a
determination
that
an
individual
is
of
sufficient
age
to
drink,
that
he’s
21
years
old
or
in
the
case
of
the
dram
shop
act
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
bartender
is
given,
the
onus
of
making
the
decisions
of
whether
somebody
is
intoxicated
or
not,
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
delegation
to
private
individuals
in
this
whole
area
of
law
regulating
in
the
field
of
alcohol
beverages
is
because
these
private
individual
are
often
the
people
who
are
closest
to
the
problems
and
to
the
situations
involved
and
this
of
course
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
i
think
this
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
think
in
the
cases
i
really
had
to
anticipated
arguing
this
case
purely
from
the
analysis
of
looking
at
it
in
terms
of
the
so
called
right
to
obtain
alcoholic
beverages
because
i
think
that
is
a
very
minimal
right
and
i
think
the
states
have
it
to
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it
certainly
can
be
greatly
controlled
because
i
think
the
states
have
a
great
amount
of
power
in
these
areas
especially
since
the
passage
of
the
21st
amendment.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
by
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
correct
but
i
will
point
out
that
this
is
not
as
discretionary
will
of
court
to
grant
such
a
review.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i’ve
never
heard
of
any
litigation
under
the
statute
prior
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
no.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
and
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
certainly
true
mr.
justice
white,
that’s
--
and
of
course
the
appellee
in
this
case
has
chosen
federal
court.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
more
effective,
yes,
and
of
course
the
appellee
mrs.
constantineau
in
this
case
has
chosen
the
federal
form
but
she
could
as
well
chosen
the
state
form
and
i
don’t
think
the
statute
can
contemplate
really
any
arbitrary
of
malicious
activity
by
a
local
officials
or
by
a
wife
under
the
statute.
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
of
such
activity
could
occur
as
to
point
to
make
this
statute
into
a
constitution.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that
is
what
the
court
said
mr.
justice
marshall,
yes.
of
course,
what’s
happened
in
this
case
is
that
mrs.
constantineau
has
been
posted
by
the
chief
of
police
for
the
state
of
the
city
of
hartford,
wisconsin.
mrs.
constantineau
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
court
alleging
two
causes
of
action
and
the
first
cause
of
action
which
was
against
the
chief
of
police
for
acting
maliciously
and
arbitrarily.
this
was
the
cause
of
action
in
which
she
mentioned
and
discussed
her
right
of
reputation
and
a
right
to
be
free
from
public
defamation
and
the
second
cause
of
action
which
is
the
cause
of
action
before
this
court
in
which
she
sought
an
junction,
the
right
of
reputation
was
never
mentioned,
the
right
to
be
free
from
public
defamation.
the
state
made
motions
to
separate
the
two
causes
of
action
and
to
intervene
as
a
party
defendant
and
the
motions
were
granted
and
at
the
hearing
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
counsel
for
mrs.
constantineau
never
mentioned
the
right
of
mrs.
constantineau
to
be
free
from
public
defamation
and
to
be
free
any
reputation
and
the
state
sought
to
produce
witnesses
on
this
point
and
subpoenaed
mrs.
constantineau
as
the
record
shows
but
judge
reynolds
of
the
majority
in
the
lower
court
refused
the
motion
of
the
state
to
produce
witnesses
and
in
the
questioning
which
appears
in
the
appendix
of
page
113
of
judge
reynolds
of
the
majority
in
the
lower
court,
myself
who
was
representing
the
state,
judge
reynolds
said
the
fact
and
“the
fact
of
being
held
up
to
ridicule
for
reasons
which
the
party
may
not
have
any
--
may
not
know
why”.
i
think
that
is
the
right
which
has
not
been
mentioned
which
bothers
me
more
than
anything
else
in
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
that’s
exactly
my
point
in
this
court
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
there’s
nothing
publicly
defamatory
about
the
actions
which
can
be
taken
under
the
statute
and
that
this
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
all
of
the
notice
says
and
it
does
appear
in
the
record,
all
of
the
notice
says
and
i
quote
from
the
one
sentence
of
the
notice
“you
are
hereby
forbidden
to
sale,
and
so
--
i'm
sorry
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
chief
justice,
to
sale
and
give
away
to
grace
norma
constantineau
any
intoxicating
liquors
or
whatsoever
kind
for
a
period
of
one
year
from
date
under
pane
of
the
penalty
set
forth
in
the
various
sections
and
that
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
the
punitive
section
which
applies
to
the
recipient
of
a
notice,
the
punitive
section
is
not
set
forth
in
the
notice
or
at
least
it
was
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
know
whether
there
would
be
a
--
(inaudible)
on
my
part
and
as
to
whether
a
bartender
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
would
be
familiar
with
the
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
sales
into
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it’s
my
contention
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
that
these
statutes
are
familiarly
known
in
wisconsin
as
the
alcoholic
posting
statutes
and
i
think
posting
could
mean
mailing
as
opposed
to
posting
in
a
bulletin
board
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
because
the
chief
of
police
could
easily
serve
as
notice
by
mail
i
would
think
on
the
various
bartenders
and
there’s
no
point
in
the
statutes
in
which
there
is
a
requirement
that
they
be
put
up
on
the
bulletin
board.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
she
is
subjected
only
in
the
statutes
to
receiving
a
notice
contemporaneously
with
the
bartenders
receiving
the
same
notice.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
the
lower
court
ordered
that
the
notice
is
to
be
retracted
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
mrs.
constantineau,
mr.
chief
justice
chose
the
federal
form
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
no
mr.
chief
justice,
not
to
my
knowledge.
she
chose
the
federal
form
and
brought
the
two
causes
of
action,
one
for
an
injunction
which
is
the
cause
of
action
here
and
the
first
cause
of
action
is
still
pending
for
damages
in
the
eastern
district.
the
majority
in
the
lower
court
in
both
sides
in
lower
court
took
the
so-called
balancing
test
approach
to
this
case
which
starts
with
the
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee.
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
concurring
opinion
and
the
later
cases
of
cafeteria
workers
versus
mcelroy
and
goldberg
versus
kelly
took
this
approach
of
balance
in
determining
the
requirements
of
due
process
to
any
given
situation
of
balancing
the
interest
of
government
under
on
the
hand
and
the
interest
of
the
individual
on
the
other
hand
and
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
the
lower
court
agreed
that
when
we
look
at
this
case
solely
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
alcoholic
beverages,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
agreed
that
clearly
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
the
due
process
did
not
require
any
notice
in
hearing
but
the
majority
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
of
the
appendix
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
use
it
--
and
they
are
familiar,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
because
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
these
statutes
are
referred
to
as
the
alcoholic
posting
statute
and
i
don’t
think
i
was
thinking
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
assume
that’s
the
only
explanation.
that’s
the
only
explanation
i
would
offer
to
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
certainly
not
mr.
justice
white,
certainly
not.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
this
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
true
but
another
section
of
the
statute
do
provide
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
statutes
can
be
renewed
for
an
additional
year.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
but
of
course
the
state
is
concerned
with
the
holding
of
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
not
say,
not
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
because
i
think
under
the
statute
this
lady
could
be
reposted
for
any
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
but
the
statutory
scheme
would
still
be
up.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
but
he
still
could
under
the
statute
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
oh
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
its
my
contention
in
the
lower
court
that
she
was
perfectly
free
to
buy
them
other
than
in
the
city
of
hardston
(voice
overlap).
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
i’ve
just
been
frustrated
mr.
justice
brennan
in
my
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct,
yes,
that
order
is
a
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct
yes
and
the
order
appears
on
page
124
of
the
appendix.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
lower
court
found
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
have
said
that
he
enjoin
in
--
if
he
posted
anyone
else
that
he
would
be,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
it’s
my
contention
if
it
pleases
the
court,
in
this
court
and
in
the
lower
court
that
the
whole
question
of
the
right
of
reputation
to
be
free
from
public
defamation
was
never
--
is
not
present
in
this
balancing
process
between
the
rights
and
interest
of
the
government
on
the
one
hand
and
the
interest
of
the
individual
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
only
finding
that
we
have
in
the
lower
court
is
the
statement
of
judge
reynolds
of
the
majority
in
the
lower
opinion
when
he
says
the
and
i
quote
from
page
119
of
the
appendix
“it
would
be
naïve
not
to
recognize
that
such
posting
or
characterization
of
an
individual
expose
him
to
public
embarrassment
or
ridicule”,
so
that
despite
the
failure
in
this
cause
of
action
of
mrs.
constantineau
to
allege
any
damage
to
injury
as
a
cause
for
the
statutes
to
be
unconstitutional
on
their
face
and
despite
the
courts
forbidding
the
states
from
calling
any
witnesses
in
this
case,
the
judge
made
that
assumption
purely
on
his
own
that
it
would
be
naïve
and
if
the
submission
of
the
state
to
this
court
that
this
whole
question
of
reputation
in
not
present
in
the
operation
of
this
statute.
it’s
not
present
in
the
record
of
this
case
and
the
deposition
which
is
in
the
record
in
which
i
repeat,
i’m
embarrassed
to
say
it
was
not
reprinted
in
the
appendix
shows
that
the
only
point
to
which
mrs.
constantineau
was
hurt
in
the
reputation
was
a
statement
that
she
made
in
the
court
in
the
deposition
that
she
was
embarrassed
by
the
operation
of
the
statute
but
later
on
she
admits
that
she
didn’t
know
her
own
reputation
in
this
small
city
of
hartford
for
any
matter
except
that
she
knew
that
people
knew
that
she
drink
a
lot,
that’s
only
point
on
which
she
knew
what
her
reputation
was
in
the
city
and
she
didn’t
know
whether
it
changed
or
not
since
the
posting
and
so
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes
and
it’s
only
the
second
cause
of
action
which
is
before
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
against
the
chief
of
police
for
acting
arbitrarily
under
the
statute.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes.
reputation
was
mentioned
in
the
seventh
paragraph
of
the
first
cause
of
action.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
that’s
correct,
yes
that
cause
of
action
is
still
pending
in
the
eastern
district.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
the
court
had
to
find
some
interest
which
was
affected
in
order
to
find
the
statutes
unconstitutional
because
it’s
clear
that
if
we
look
at
this
solely
in
terms
of
the
regulation
of
alcoholic
beverages,
the
statutes
are
constitutional.
so
the
state
of
the
court
had
to
come
up
with
something
and
i
came
up
with
this
point
of
reputation.
and
it’s
my
point
to
this
court,
the
state's
point,
that
this
right
to
represent
a
reputation
is
not
involved
in
this
--
in
the
operation
of
these
statutes
and
should
not
be
accounted
for
in
the
balancing
test.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
first
count
is
still
pending
in
the
courts,
yes
so
it's
my
point,
if
the
court
are
please
before
of
this
court
that
this
whole
point
of
reputation,
it
should
not
be
put
on
the
balancing
scale
of
due
process
if
you
please.
for
the
one
reason
that
is
not
involved
in
the
record
of
this
case
in
any
way
that
the
statutes
in
their
operation
by
their
own
terms
in
any
way
involve
in
the
right
of
reputation.
and
also
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
if
we
look
at
the
other
cases,
and
i
think
you
have
mr.
ramsey
clark
the
other
day
before
this
very
court
talking
about
reputation
in
here.
there
he
was
talking
about
a
case
where
the
man
had
been
severely
damaged.
there
has
been
no
concrete
showing
of
any
sort
that
the
economic
future
or
economic
interest
of
mrs.
constantineau
or
have
in
way
been
affected
by
the
operation
of
these
statutes
and
that
she
does
not
have
viable
economic
alternatives
after
as
a
result
and
after
the
posting
which
took
place
under
these
statutes.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
i
think
wages
are
far
important
on
the
balancing
scale
of
the
prices.
that’s
my
point
mr.
justice
white.
if
we
look
at
this
balancing
scale
between
the
interest
of
the
government
and
the
interest
of
the
individual.
if
we
look
at
it
solely
in
terms
of
the
right
against
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
not
only
the
--
mr.
justice
white,
what
the
state
thinks
but
in
my
opinion,
what
the
other
interest
that
are
been
affected
in
the
other
cases
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
which
are
far
more
substantial
interest
than
it’s
involved
in
this
case,
in
the
right
to
obtain
alcoholic
beverages.
and
i
used
the
word
right,
the
so
called
right.
it’s
not
in
the
right
privilege
sense
that
i’m
using
it.
i
think
when
we
compare
the
balancing
in
this
case,
the
due
process
balancing
whether
due
process
balancing
which
has
occurred
in
other
cases
in
which
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
would
say
not
shoes
but
i
think
the
right.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
the
right
of
the
individual
to
obtain.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
--
in
this
case,
the
right
of
the
individual
to
obtain
the
alcoholic
beverages
has
traditionally
been
a
very
frail
one
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
then
we
have
to
go
through
the
balancing
process
all
over
again
i
think.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
all
i
think
the
state
has
a
much
diminished
power
to
regulate
shot
gun
shells
and
it
does,
mr.
justice
white,
that
it
does
to
regulate
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well,
i
think
each
commodity
would
have
to
go
through
this
balancing
test
itself.
and
i
couldn’t
say
whether
it’s
not
up
to
me
say
whether
an
alcoholic
beverages
are
more
less
important
than
shot
gun
shell
but
i
think
the
courts
here
and
the
law
traditionally,
especially
since
the
passage
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
shown,
that
the
right
of
the
individual
to
obtain
alcoholic
beverage
is
very
frail
right
and
that
if
we
look
at
these
statutes
purely
in
those
terms
then
clearly
even
the
majority
in
the
lower
court
agrees
it.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
couldn’t
find
any
cases
under
the
statute
in
this
state
or
in
the
other
states
which
we
should
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
due
process.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
not
to
my
familiarity
mr.
chief
justice,
no.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
if
we
look
in
terms
of
this
balancing
test
that
i’ve
been
talking
about,
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
it
so
great
in
the
area
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
the
past.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
think
that
the
--
mr.
chief
justice
please
the
other
cases
have
shown
that
to
be
the
case
at
all
that
and
i’ve
cited
cases
in
the
field
of
regulating
a
business
interest,
the
right
of
a
business
to
be
free
from
competition
and
the
right
of
public
employee
to
continue
in
the
job
and
the
right
of
a
public
employee
to
continue
in
the
job.
all
of
these
things,
all
of
these
interests
which
i
submit
to
the
court
are
much
more
significant
interest
that
are
involved
in
this
case
have
been
taken
away
without
notice
in
the
hearing.
and
i
think
there
are
rights
that
can
be
taken
away
without
a
notice
in
the
hearing.
and
this
brings
me
to
the
point
which
i
entered
the
brief
on.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
that
would
differ
from
this
instance
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
know
that
you
can
make
that
assumption
mr.
justice
marshall.
assuming
not
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
can
you
make
that
assumption.
the
statute
merely
says
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
assumingly,
it
would
only
be
for
the
reason
set
forth,
and
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
know
that
the
--
mr.
justice
marshall
that
a
publishing
takes
place
in
the
context
which
would
in
anyway
be
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know
that
the
notice
that’s
contemplated
by
these
statutes
in
any
way
provides
for
any
defamations
in
the
sense
that
it
merely
says
that
they
are
forbidden
to
sell
to
this
individual.
and
now
what
conclusions
or
recipient
might
draw
not
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i’m
not
familiar
with
any
litigations
in
wisconsin
about.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
there
was
no
suggestion
made
to
the
court
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
think
that
the
statute
mr.
justice
harlan
by
its
terms
is
reasonably
unambiguous.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
well
motions
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
motions
to
dismiss
were
made
for
this
district.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
i
don’t
believe
it
was
articulated
in
that
way
although
there
are
–
i
have
only
been
counsel
for
one
of
the
two
causes
of
action
mr.
chief
justice.
i
see
that
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
thank
you
mr.
schapiro.
mr.
benjamin
southwick
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas
but
the
year
was
--
mr.
benjamin
southwick
he
did
in
this
case
when
the
lower
court
ordered
him
to
but
whether
or
not
he
could,
the
statute
doesn’t
provide
any
mechanism
for
him
to
do
so.
if
it
was
it
would
be
in
his
own
discretion.
and
i
couldn’t
answer
the
question
further
now.
