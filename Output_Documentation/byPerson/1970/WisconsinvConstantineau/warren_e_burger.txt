we’ll

arguments
in

wisconsin
against
constantineau.
mr.
southwick,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
an
individual
who
has
been
thus
posted
guilty
of
any
criminal
act
if
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
presents
himself
to
buying
liquor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
southwick,
what
efforts
were
made
to
utilize
state
proceedings
or
administrative
proceedings
to
deal
with
this
problem
by
mrs.
constantineau?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
she
didn’t
try
anywhere
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
generally
or
just
as
to
mrs.
constantineau?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
that
rather
relevant
to
the
mootness
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
isn’t
the
point.
the
question
is
whether
court,
either
with
or
without
a
suggestion
ought
to
enter
in
to
this
case
for
the
state
courts
have
to
take
in
to
construe
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
in
what
with
the
question
why
is
this
case
here
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
ground?
on
the
grounds
that
they
should
abstain?
was
it
articulated
in
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
if
you’d
like
to
finish
today,
you
might
bear
in
mind
that
the
hour
is
quite
late.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
they
do
in
milwaukee
when
this
arises,
you
probably
have
several
thousand
of
them
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
among
your
constitutional
right
while
we
have
here
just
pausing
for
a
moment
only
last
1969
term,
less
than
a
year
ago,
important
federal
constitutional
claims
were
raised
by
some
people
in
the
fishing
business
in
alaska
and
this
court
said
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
from
considering
it
until
the
state
courts
construed,
state
courts
of
alaska
had
construed
their
own
statute,
why
shouldn’t
the
district
court
here
have
abstained
until
the
state
courts
of
wisconsin
have
decided
to
what
this
statute
meant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
would
you
negate
the
abstention
doctrine
entirely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometime
we
think
that
they
don’t
exercise
that
discretion,
should
we
enough,
we
give
them
some
help
lines.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
if
this
were
the
mayor
of
the
town
of
hartford
since
you
emphasized
the
public
officials,
does
he
have
a
different
right
from
this
lady?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
criticize
him
by
posting
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
might
affect
his
right
to
collect
damages
but
i
can’t
see
what
it
would
have
to
do
with
the
constitutional
issues
involved
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
state
had
a
statute,
you
say
it
was
indicated
in
wisconsin
does
not
have
the
dram
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
the
state
which
had
the
statute
giving
the
bartender
the
power
to
decide
that
a
given
person
has
had
enough
or
too
much?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
hasn’t
the
state
vested
in
that
bartender
not
only
the
power
but
a
duty
to
in
effect
stigmatize
them
by
saying
i’m
not
going
to
say
to
you
anymore?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
statutes
would
fall
too
then
wouldn’t
they
on
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
pretty
public
if
he
says
it
in
the
bar
with
29
people
that
line
up
at
the
bar
that,
“i’m
not
going
to
let
you
have
anymore
drinks
you
have
too
much”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
injunction
has
been
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
over.
