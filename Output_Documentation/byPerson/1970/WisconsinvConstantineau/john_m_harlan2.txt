justice
john
m.
harlan
when
you
are
talking
about
findings,
what
you
mean
and
would
do
it,
do
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
the
finding
of
wife
or
in
this
case
who
made
the
finding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
his
own
mind?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
you
take
the
adverse
case,
the
wife
could
make
the
finding
against
her
husband,
isn’t
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
notice
that
a
copy
of
the
notice
that’s
required
to
be
given,
does
that
precede
the
posting
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
recipient
doesn’t
get
it
before
there
is
the
notice
in
whatever
legal
effect
that
it
has
to
take
effect,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
be?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
think
there
is
something
in
your
brief
that
--
you
can
call
it
that
--
you
said
that
if
the
recipient
in
one
of
these
notices,
thought
the
findings
so
called
was
improvidently
made,
they
can
get
it
reviewed
by
a
common
law
writ?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
wisconsin?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
ever
heard
of
one
being
written,
is
it
a
procedure
that’s
been
utilized?
justice
john
m.
harlan
never?
justice
john
m.
harlan
she
is
subject
to
a
notice
now
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
mean
is
she
is
subjected
to
this
original
notice,
the
force
of
that's
expired,
doesn’t
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
won
in
this
case,
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
can
last
for
a
year
though?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
so
far
as
this
is
notice
is
concerned,
no
matter
what
happens
to
this
case
to
notice
suspends?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
but
what
i’m
raising
is,
are
there
any
questions
about
the
state
just
in
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that’s
his
new
notice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
she
has
become
a
tea
toddler
and
she
would
--
there
would
be
any
basis
for
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
that
there’s
no
case
but
i
understood
you
in
the
wisconsin
courts
dealt
with
any
phase
of
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
suggestion
made
to
the
district
court
to
the
federal
court,
if
they
are
to
sustain
and
send
it
back
to
get
some
kind
of
interpretation
in
the
state
courts
used
in
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
see
any
utility
in
that
now?
and
they
were
dealing
blind
here
with
the
statute
that
you
say
is
never
even
in
the
state
litigation,
we
don’t
know
what
the
state
courts
would
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
believe
that
the
state
under
the
21st
amendment
would
pass
a
law
saying
that
no
liquors
would
be
served
to
any
woman
who
had
children?

john
m.

you
got
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure?
