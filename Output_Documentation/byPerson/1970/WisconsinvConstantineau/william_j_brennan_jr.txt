we
are
therefore
to
assume
that
he
must
have
made
the
necessary
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the

are
implicit
in
the
conclusion?

that

mr.

i
noticed
in
page

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
the
colloquy
between
you

you
used
--
you
said
something
about
some
admitted
fact
that
the
plaintiff
has
been
drinking
outside
the
city
of
hartford
and
since
january,
on
the
date
when
she
was
posted.
now,
when
you
used
the
word,
in
what
sense
--
did
you
use
a
synonym?
justice

what
i’m
asking
was
if

term
and
it
was
judge

using
it
as
a
synonym
for
the
word
mailing?

j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible).

she
is
perfectly
free
to
buy
all
liquors
she

am
i
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
said
--
i’d
rather
she
said
that
she
was
physically
buying
it
outside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

there
been
some
reason

j.
brennan,
jr.
