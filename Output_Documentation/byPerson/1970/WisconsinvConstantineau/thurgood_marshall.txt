mr.

what
can
the
posted
mean
do
once
he
gets
the
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
he
gets
the
notice
and
everybody
else
gets
the
notice,
what
under
the
sun
can
he
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
a
tea
toddler.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
no
machinery
set
up
by
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
no
due
process
at
all?
do
you
agree
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
once
these
are
all
mailed
out,
is
there
a
way
to
get
a
mail
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
prevents
the
bartender
from
pasting
this
notice
up
on
his
mirror,
in
his
bar
so
that
guard
and
anybody
else
can
see
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we’re
all
clear
that
there
is
no
resemblance
to
due
process
in
this
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
or
after
a
man’s
name
is
put
up
any
place,
anybody
wants
to
put
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i’m
saying
is
there’s
no
protection
clause--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
to
present
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
a
wife
tells
her
husband
you
need
to
give
me
a
mink
coat
christmas
or
you
get
posted
on
january
1,
he’s
in
trouble?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
she
says
if
you
don’t
give
one
i’m
going
to
have
you
posted?
she
get
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
talking
about
regulating
the
dram
shops
not
the
shoppees
or
the
shoppers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
goes
to
the
shopper
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
certainly
can
be
greatly
controlled?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
rule
on
the
statute
on
his
face,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
should
be,
the
rest
is
obvious
and
i
think,
they
just
said
as
i
read
they
pin
the
statute
on
his
face
was
unconstitutional
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
southwick,
just
one
question
on
that
point.
suppose
the
statute
says,
that
the
chief
of
police
has
a
right
to
set
the
following
notice
that
joe
stokes
has
been
declared
by
me
to
be
a
public
drunkard,
for
that
reason
you
are
ordered
not
to
sell
any
intoxicated
beverages.
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
exemption
of
using
the
words
declared
by
me
a
public
drunkard,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
under
a
particular
statute.
can't
i
assume
that
every
liquor
dealer
knows
what
that
statute
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
are
the
reasons,
the
chief
of
police
tells
you
that
you
can
serve
liquor
that
you
don’t,
what
other
possible
reasons
could
it
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
just
what
i
saying
it.
my
whole
question,
this
is
not
a
question,
regulating
this
man
or
this
woman
in
this
case
drinking
or
regulating
the
selling
of
liquor
to
this
man
or
woman,
it’s
the
publishing
of
their
names.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
context
of
liable
at
slant,
publishing
it
when
you
give
it
to
some
third
person.
that’s
publishing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
give
it
to
these
third
persons
who
are
all
the
liquor
dealers.

as
it
appears
in

statute

it
is
used,
what
is
your
idea?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
record
about
being
on
the
wall?
justice
