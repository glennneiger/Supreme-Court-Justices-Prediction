mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
i
will
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
s.
a.
schapiro.
i
represent
mrs.
constantineau.
i’d
like
to
just
inform
accordance
to
the
facts.
the
chief
of
police
went
out
like
a
processor
who
went
out
and
handed
the
notice
to
all
the
persons
in
town
dealing
with
liquor.
we
don’t
know—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
there
were
about
17
taverns
and
about
20
or
15,
20
liquor
stores
in
this
community
about
five—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes,
but
i
haven’t
known
of
it
arising
in
milwaukee,
it’s
only
used
in
the
smaller
communities
where
there
is
probably
a
more
feasible
means
of
controlling
it.
before
the
year
ran
out
that
this
notice
was
posted
for,
the
district
court
stepped
in
and
enjoined
further
action,
we
started
this
action
in
the
federal
court
because
we
believe
there
was
a
substantial
federal
question.
there
were
rights
of
this
lady
under
the
ninth
amendment
or
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
if
it
did
your
honor
justice
black
it
won’t
be
in
favor
of
our
case
and
we
did
not
plead
anything
with
respect
to
the
21st
amendment,
that
would
be,
if
it
was
relevant
which
the
state
has
brought
up
would
certainly
be
a
factor
on
their
behalf.
i
think,
the
counsel
has
been
focusing
no
matter
on
procedural
due
process
but
i
think
we
should
look
at
the
nature
of
the
states
action.
here,
the
state
is
moving
against
the
citizen
who
is
not
a
public
figure
nor
a
public
official.
and
the
power
to
do
this
is
vested
in
this
people
with
merely
discretionary
powers,
and
administrative
official,
a
ministerial
official
in
this
case
is
the
chief
of
police,
and
his
discretion
is
almost
unrestricted.
a
lessening
of
the
estate
is
one
of
the
reasons
or
the
misspending
of
the
estate
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
can
do
this
to
this
lady
and
now
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
have
we
published
a
state
law?
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no,
the
state
has
done
that
in
their
appendix.
they
have
published
the
law
in
their
appendix
and
in
their
brief.
that
law
is
set
out
in
full.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
because
your
honor
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it’s
well-established
in
a
law
when
a
substantial
federal
question
is
raised
and
a
three-judge
court
has
convened,
that
court
can
in
its
own
discretion
listen
to
the
issues
presented.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
i
would
not
negate
it
entirely
but
i
would
rather
put
it
in
a
discretionary
manner
with
the
united
states
district
courts
especially
when
there’s
a
three-judge
court.
you
know
we
can
always
run
into
the
matters
that
we’re
going
to
the
state
court
first,
exhaust
their
remedies
there
and
then
move
to
the
federal
courts,
it’s
nothing
but
a
revolving
door
process
and
the
only
one
that’s
getting
exhausted
is
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff
in
the
court
not
the
state
remedies.
so,
to
facilitate
what
might
ultimately
be
the
end
result,
we
start
out
in
the
federal
court
where
there
is
discretion
and
where
this
three-judge
court
and
judge
reynolds
particularly
saw
the
reason
to
exercise
that
discretion.
and
there
are
cases
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
to
the
lower
court
and
motions
to
dismiss
that
support
our
position
that
it
is
a
discretionary
function
of
the
three-judge
district
court
to
hear
the
matter
if
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes
your
honor,
i
would
go
up
with
that
statement.
but
we
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
state
action
as
one
of
being
a
stigmatic
identification
of
a
citizen
who
is
not
a
public
figure
and
not
a
public
official.
and
the
effect
on
that
is
to
single
out
the
citizen
in
a
spotlight
with
unfavorable
connotation.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
he
would
have
—
there
would
be
a
right
to
criticize
his
actions,
his
behavior
because
he
is
a
public
official
under
the
new
york
times
rule.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
that
under
this
law
the
chief
of
police
could
if
he
dared
to
do
so,
but
the
liability
of
the
chief
of
police
might
be
different
because
the
mayor
is
a
public
official.
under
the
new
york
times
rule,
the
public
official
is
subject
to
criticism
in
any
parts
of
his
life
which
is
a
public
matter.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
under
the
first
amendment
we
have
to
remember
mr.
chief
justice
that
free
speech
and
with
respect
to
the
criticism
of
public
officials
is
something
that
is
almost
—
what
is
the
last
thing
next
to
something
that
is
absolute.
the
only
thing
this
court
has
stated
that
only
if
the
matter
is
done
maliciously
and
with
reckless
disregard
to
the
truth
can
criticism
of
the
public
officials
be
actionable.
but
here
we’re
singling
out
our
private
citizen
who
has
the
right
to
live
her
own
life
in
her
own
quite
way
and
an
assuming
way.
and
if
that’s
her
expression
of
life,
it’s
a
matter
of
invasion
of
that
expression
of
living.
and
that
i
submit
is
as
an
invasion
of
her
privacy
and
her
state
of
mind.
this
court
recognized
that
in
map
and
it
recognized
in
stanley
versus
georgia
that
the
physical
enclosure
of
a
home
is
sacred.
and
the
state
can’t
go
in
there
and
here,
the
state
is
going
beyond
the
enclosure.
it’s
going
right
into
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
citizen
herself.
it’s
imposing
a
stigma
on
her,
not
only
when
she
is
in
her
home,
it’s
in
her
heart
and
in
her
soul
and
attached
to
her
when
she
leaves
her
home.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
he
can
be
prosecuted
in
wisconsin
for
non-support.
if
he
is
then
of
course
he
is
given
the
due
process
protection
of
hearing
before
judicial
form
or
the
facts
that
are
allowed
and
counsels
present
it.
there’s
a
hearing
before
any
findings
made
cross
examinations
is
permitted.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
that’s
correct
—-
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
right.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well
it
has
—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
not
unless
a
public
declaration
of
the
effect
would
be
made
because
—-
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
but
then
your
honor,
it’s
the
citizens
own
acts
in
becoming
intoxicated
that’s
discredited
himself
not
the
bartender’s.
here
is
a
woman
that’s
a
divorcee,
she’s
got
four
children.
she’s
never
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
she
has
never
been
convicted
of
being
drunk.
and
here
the
chief
of
police
is
going
out
on
his
own
and
trying
to
limit
her
rates
without
a
notice
and
a
hearing.
and
in
a
matter
calculated
that
caused
her
damaged
with
the
rest
of
the
community
with
whom
she
lives.
now,
the
bartender
if
he
says
so
the
one
that’s
asking
for
the
drink
is
responsible
for
his
being
refused
by
becoming
intoxicated
in
the
first
place.
here,
the
citizen
is
not
responsible
for
doing
anything
wrong
that
brought
about
the
particular
action
except
insofar
as
her
displeasure
existed
in
the
eyes
of
the
chief
of
police.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
possible
your
honor
mr.
justice
harlan
because
that
would
deprive
that
woman
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
whereas
others
and
her
family,
others
in
her
same
position
without
children
would
be
permitted
to
consume
liquor
and
having
children
would
not
be
a
valid
criteria
for
denying
it
to
her.
so,
it
would
be
in
my
position
that
that
would
be
a
deprivation
of
—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
my
idea
is
that
the
notice
since
it
was
served
in
the
manner
of
a
process
server
serving
a
notice
is
that
it
appears
on
the
wall
of
the
taverns
to
give
notice
to
all
persons
that
they
cannot
sell
or
transfer.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no,
there
isn’t
your
honor
mr.
justice
marshall
there
isn’t.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
you’re
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
and
when
this
case
comes
to
trial,
those
facts
will
be
established
and
made
part
of
the
record
but
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no
your
honor
mr.
justice
william.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
it’s
not
over
at
all
mr.
justice.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
decided
and
after
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes,
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
notice
was
actually
placed
on
the
wall
or
whether
it
was
just
handed
has
not
been
decided.
those
are
issues
of
facts
which
will
be
determined.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
it
can
be
invalid
without
them
actually
being
put
on
the
wall
because
the
fact
that
they’re
disseminated
throughout
the
community,
the
person
has
no
chance
to
meet
the
inferences
before
they’re
disseminated.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no,
i
wouldn’t
mr
justice
blackmun
for
the
reason
that
this
statute
is
inherently
aimed
towards
the
poor
in
the
community
because
they’re
the
ones
who
was
--
who
would
be
the
obvious
ones
who
would
be
restricted
because
they
are
the
ones
who
be
lessening
their
estates
and
leaving
others
to
support
the
wealthy
in
the
community,
who
could
spend
all
they
wanted
more
and
not
having
their
state
lessened
and
others
in
the
family
deprived
of
their
support
would
not
be
touched
by
this
law.
and
therefore,
i
feel
it’s
discriminatory
against
the
poor
of
the
community.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
a
wealthy
person
your
honor
can
be
place
on
the
guardianship
but
i
think
that
in
any
such
event
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
incompetency
by
a
tribunal
with
cross
examination,
the
rights
of
counsel,
hearing
and
notice.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
the
reason
your
honor
mr.
justice
brennan
is
because
the
state
appealed
this
case
to
this
court
and
staying
the
appeal
of
the
case
and
the
determination
of
the
facts
by
this
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
that
is
the
reason
i
feel
the
lower
court
has
not
further
proceeded
in
this
manner.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
our
position
that
under
those
circumstances
nevertheless,
it
is
state
action
involved
here
and
any
state
action
would
under
the
civil
rights
act
which
this
act
is
--
which
this
case
is
proceeding
and
it
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action.
there
might
be
a
difference
if
the
law
is
unconstitutional
and
malicious
or
negligent
posting
of
these
notices,
but
the
law
of
this
case
would
nevertheless
be
allowed
to
proceed
to
trial.
it’s
our
position
generally
and
as
a
closing
comment
that
the
rights
of
the
plaintiff,
the
appellee
here
are
rights
of
privacy
and
rights
to
her
own
name
and
reputation
which
couldn’t
be
included
in
the
ninth
amendment
or
on
the
14th
amendment,
due
process
cause
alone
or
under
the
incorporation
theory,
under
the
first
amendment
because
her
right
to
remain
a
non-public
figure,
to
live
her
own
life
in
her
own
quite
way
is
generally
an
aspect
of
privacy
and
the
state
forcing
her
to
become
a
public
figure
is
a
deprivation
of
her
right
of
privacy.
and
we
likewise
have
the
question
of
reputation
involved
in
this
matter
because
--
and
i
just
want
to
make
this
as
my
closing
comment
which
i
wanted
to
go
in
a
detail
but
i’ll
just
say
that
the
stigma
attached
to
this
creates
an
outcast
group
in
society,
and
that
outcast
group
is
forbidden
by
its
own
nature
to
have
any
associations
with
other
groups
in
society.
people
will
tend
to
shy
away
from
this
people.
and
as
a
result,
their
rights
of
association
are
limited.
and
this
is
not
the
right
of
association
in
a
political
group
to
petition
of
the
government
for
a
redress,
this
is
a
socio-basic
right
of
association,
that
it
would
inherently
cause
the
posted
person
to
be
unaffiliatable
and
unassociatable
with
all
segments
of
society
except
those
in
the
outcast
group
which
she
has
involuntarily
become
a
member
of.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
it’s
not
in
the
record
but
all
of
the
record,
this
is
a
common
practice
by
the
chief
of
the
police
in
this
community.
there
maybe
seven
or
eight
a
year
like
this.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
certainly,
the
discretion
is
almost
limited.
the
only
criteria
is
as
applied
to
this
case
because
this
woman
is
not
dangerous
to
the
community
which
is
one
ground
is
the
lessening
of
the
state,
the
misspending
of
money.
ansd
i
think
that
in
the
hands
of
a
ministerial
official
without
notice
and
hearing
is
one
such
instance
of
violation
of
not
only
procedural
but
substantive
due
process.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
we
saw
that
there
was
no
remedy
by
certiorari
in
the
state
courts.
i
looked
into
that
matter
and
certiorari
would
only
be
permitted
to
review
the
actions
of
an
administrative
tribunal.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes
your
honor
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure
but
that
would
not
cause
the
chief
of
police
to
take
the
notices
down.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
injunction
would
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
an
injunction
and
damage
action
would
cause
the
notice
to
be
taken
down
but
the
likelihood
of
success
in
the
damage
action
mr.
justice
white
in
the
state
courts
would
be
much
more
difficult
than
it
would
under
the
civil
rights
act
where
there
is
definite
state
action.
under
the
state
law
that
would
probably
be
the
requirements
of
probing
matters
beyond
state
action.
and
as
a
result
it
was
our
position
that
it
would
be
an
easier
damage
action
to
prove
in
a
federal
action
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
i
don’t
know.
he
took
that
deposition
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
in
the
record
downstairs.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
i
will
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
s.
a.
schapiro.
i
represent
mrs.
constantineau.
i’d
like
to
just
inform
accordance
to
the
facts.
the
chief
of
police
went
out
like
a
processor
who
went
out
and
handed
the
notice
to
all
the
persons
in
town
dealing
with
liquor.
we
don’t
know—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
there
were
about
17
taverns
and
about
20
or
15,
20
liquor
stores
in
this
community
about
five—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes,
but
i
haven’t
known
of
it
arising
in
milwaukee,
it’s
only
used
in
the
smaller
communities
where
there
is
probably
a
more
feasible
means
of
controlling
it.
before
the
year
ran
out
that
this
notice
was
posted
for,
the
district
court
stepped
in
and
enjoined
further
action,
we
started
this
action
in
the
federal
court
because
we
believe
there
was
a
substantial
federal
question.
there
were
rights
of
this
lady
under
the
ninth
amendment
or
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
if
it
did
your
honor
justice
black
it
won’t
be
in
favor
of
our
case
and
we
did
not
plead
anything
with
respect
to
the
21st
amendment,
that
would
be,
if
it
was
relevant
which
the
state
has
brought
up
would
certainly
be
a
factor
on
their
behalf.
i
think,
the
counsel
has
been
focusing
no
matter
on
procedural
due
process
but
i
think
we
should
look
at
the
nature
of
the
states
action.
here,
the
state
is
moving
against
the
citizen
who
is
not
a
public
figure
nor
a
public
official.
and
the
power
to
do
this
is
vested
in
this
people
with
merely
discretionary
powers,
and
administrative
official,
a
ministerial
official
in
this
case
is
the
chief
of
police,
and
his
discretion
is
almost
unrestricted.
a
lessening
of
the
estate
is
one
of
the
reasons
or
the
misspending
of
the
estate
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
can
do
this
to
this
lady
and
now
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
have
we
published
a
state
law?
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no,
the
state
has
done
that
in
their
appendix.
they
have
published
the
law
in
their
appendix
and
in
their
brief.
that
law
is
set
out
in
full.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
because
your
honor
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it’s
well-established
in
a
law
when
a
substantial
federal
question
is
raised
and
a
three-judge
court
has
convened,
that
court
can
in
its
own
discretion
listen
to
the
issues
presented.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
i
would
not
negate
it
entirely
but
i
would
rather
put
it
in
a
discretionary
manner
with
the
united
states
district
courts
especially
when
there’s
a
three-judge
court.
you
know
we
can
always
run
into
the
matters
that
we’re
going
to
the
state
court
first,
exhaust
their
remedies
there
and
then
move
to
the
federal
courts,
it’s
nothing
but
a
revolving
door
process
and
the
only
one
that’s
getting
exhausted
is
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff
in
the
court
not
the
state
remedies.
so,
to
facilitate
what
might
ultimately
be
the
end
result,
we
start
out
in
the
federal
court
where
there
is
discretion
and
where
this
three-judge
court
and
judge
reynolds
particularly
saw
the
reason
to
exercise
that
discretion.
and
there
are
cases
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
to
the
lower
court
and
motions
to
dismiss
that
support
our
position
that
it
is
a
discretionary
function
of
the
three-judge
district
court
to
hear
the
matter
if
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes
your
honor,
i
would
go
up
with
that
statement.
but
we
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
state
action
as
one
of
being
a
stigmatic
identification
of
a
citizen
who
is
not
a
public
figure
and
not
a
public
official.
and
the
effect
on
that
is
to
single
out
the
citizen
in
a
spotlight
with
unfavorable
connotation.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
he
would
have
—
there
would
be
a
right
to
criticize
his
actions,
his
behavior
because
he
is
a
public
official
under
the
new
york
times
rule.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
that
under
this
law
the
chief
of
police
could
if
he
dared
to
do
so,
but
the
liability
of
the
chief
of
police
might
be
different
because
the
mayor
is
a
public
official.
under
the
new
york
times
rule,
the
public
official
is
subject
to
criticism
in
any
parts
of
his
life
which
is
a
public
matter.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
under
the
first
amendment
we
have
to
remember
mr.
chief
justice
that
free
speech
and
with
respect
to
the
criticism
of
public
officials
is
something
that
is
almost
—
what
is
the
last
thing
next
to
something
that
is
absolute.
the
only
thing
this
court
has
stated
that
only
if
the
matter
is
done
maliciously
and
with
reckless
disregard
to
the
truth
can
criticism
of
the
public
officials
be
actionable.
but
here
we’re
singling
out
our
private
citizen
who
has
the
right
to
live
her
own
life
in
her
own
quite
way
and
an
assuming
way.
and
if
that’s
her
expression
of
life,
it’s
a
matter
of
invasion
of
that
expression
of
living.
and
that
i
submit
is
as
an
invasion
of
her
privacy
and
her
state
of
mind.
this
court
recognized
that
in
map
and
it
recognized
in
stanley
versus
georgia
that
the
physical
enclosure
of
a
home
is
sacred.
and
the
state
can’t
go
in
there
and
here,
the
state
is
going
beyond
the
enclosure.
it’s
going
right
into
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
citizen
herself.
it’s
imposing
a
stigma
on
her,
not
only
when
she
is
in
her
home,
it’s
in
her
heart
and
in
her
soul
and
attached
to
her
when
she
leaves
her
home.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
he
can
be
prosecuted
in
wisconsin
for
non-support.
if
he
is
then
of
course
he
is
given
the
due
process
protection
of
hearing
before
judicial
form
or
the
facts
that
are
allowed
and
counsels
present
it.
there’s
a
hearing
before
any
findings
made
cross
examinations
is
permitted.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
that’s
correct
—-
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
right.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well
it
has
—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
not
unless
a
public
declaration
of
the
effect
would
be
made
because
—-
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
but
then
your
honor,
it’s
the
citizens
own
acts
in
becoming
intoxicated
that’s
discredited
himself
not
the
bartender’s.
here
is
a
woman
that’s
a
divorcee,
she’s
got
four
children.
she’s
never
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
she
has
never
been
convicted
of
being
drunk.
and
here
the
chief
of
police
is
going
out
on
his
own
and
trying
to
limit
her
rates
without
a
notice
and
a
hearing.
and
in
a
matter
calculated
that
caused
her
damaged
with
the
rest
of
the
community
with
whom
she
lives.
now,
the
bartender
if
he
says
so
the
one
that’s
asking
for
the
drink
is
responsible
for
his
being
refused
by
becoming
intoxicated
in
the
first
place.
here,
the
citizen
is
not
responsible
for
doing
anything
wrong
that
brought
about
the
particular
action
except
insofar
as
her
displeasure
existed
in
the
eyes
of
the
chief
of
police.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
possible
your
honor
mr.
justice
harlan
because
that
would
deprive
that
woman
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
whereas
others
and
her
family,
others
in
her
same
position
without
children
would
be
permitted
to
consume
liquor
and
having
children
would
not
be
a
valid
criteria
for
denying
it
to
her.
so,
it
would
be
in
my
position
that
that
would
be
a
deprivation
of
—
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
my
idea
is
that
the
notice
since
it
was
served
in
the
manner
of
a
process
server
serving
a
notice
is
that
it
appears
on
the
wall
of
the
taverns
to
give
notice
to
all
persons
that
they
cannot
sell
or
transfer.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no,
there
isn’t
your
honor
mr.
justice
marshall
there
isn’t.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
you’re
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
and
when
this
case
comes
to
trial,
those
facts
will
be
established
and
made
part
of
the
record
but
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no
your
honor
mr.
justice
william.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
it’s
not
over
at
all
mr.
justice.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
decided
and
after
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes,
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
notice
was
actually
placed
on
the
wall
or
whether
it
was
just
handed
has
not
been
decided.
those
are
issues
of
facts
which
will
be
determined.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
it
can
be
invalid
without
them
actually
being
put
on
the
wall
because
the
fact
that
they’re
disseminated
throughout
the
community,
the
person
has
no
chance
to
meet
the
inferences
before
they’re
disseminated.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
no,
i
wouldn’t
mr
justice
blackmun
for
the
reason
that
this
statute
is
inherently
aimed
towards
the
poor
in
the
community
because
they’re
the
ones
who
was
--
who
would
be
the
obvious
ones
who
would
be
restricted
because
they
are
the
ones
who
be
lessening
their
estates
and
leaving
others
to
support
the
wealthy
in
the
community,
who
could
spend
all
they
wanted
more
and
not
having
their
state
lessened
and
others
in
the
family
deprived
of
their
support
would
not
be
touched
by
this
law.
and
therefore,
i
feel
it’s
discriminatory
against
the
poor
of
the
community.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
a
wealthy
person
your
honor
can
be
place
on
the
guardianship
but
i
think
that
in
any
such
event
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
incompetency
by
a
tribunal
with
cross
examination,
the
rights
of
counsel,
hearing
and
notice.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
the
reason
your
honor
mr.
justice
brennan
is
because
the
state
appealed
this
case
to
this
court
and
staying
the
appeal
of
the
case
and
the
determination
of
the
facts
by
this
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
that
is
the
reason
i
feel
the
lower
court
has
not
further
proceeded
in
this
manner.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
our
position
that
under
those
circumstances
nevertheless,
it
is
state
action
involved
here
and
any
state
action
would
under
the
civil
rights
act
which
this
act
is
--
which
this
case
is
proceeding
and
it
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action.
there
might
be
a
difference
if
the
law
is
unconstitutional
and
malicious
or
negligent
posting
of
these
notices,
but
the
law
of
this
case
would
nevertheless
be
allowed
to
proceed
to
trial.
it’s
our
position
generally
and
as
a
closing
comment
that
the
rights
of
the
plaintiff,
the
appellee
here
are
rights
of
privacy
and
rights
to
her
own
name
and
reputation
which
couldn’t
be
included
in
the
ninth
amendment
or
on
the
14th
amendment,
due
process
cause
alone
or
under
the
incorporation
theory,
under
the
first
amendment
because
her
right
to
remain
a
non-public
figure,
to
live
her
own
life
in
her
own
quite
way
is
generally
an
aspect
of
privacy
and
the
state
forcing
her
to
become
a
public
figure
is
a
deprivation
of
her
right
of
privacy.
and
we
likewise
have
the
question
of
reputation
involved
in
this
matter
because
--
and
i
just
want
to
make
this
as
my
closing
comment
which
i
wanted
to
go
in
a
detail
but
i’ll
just
say
that
the
stigma
attached
to
this
creates
an
outcast
group
in
society,
and
that
outcast
group
is
forbidden
by
its
own
nature
to
have
any
associations
with
other
groups
in
society.
people
will
tend
to
shy
away
from
this
people.
and
as
a
result,
their
rights
of
association
are
limited.
and
this
is
not
the
right
of
association
in
a
political
group
to
petition
of
the
government
for
a
redress,
this
is
a
socio-basic
right
of
association,
that
it
would
inherently
cause
the
posted
person
to
be
unaffiliatable
and
unassociatable
with
all
segments
of
society
except
those
in
the
outcast
group
which
she
has
involuntarily
become
a
member
of.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
it’s
not
in
the
record
but
all
of
the
record,
this
is
a
common
practice
by
the
chief
of
the
police
in
this
community.
there
maybe
seven
or
eight
a
year
like
this.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
certainly,
the
discretion
is
almost
limited.
the
only
criteria
is
as
applied
to
this
case
because
this
woman
is
not
dangerous
to
the
community
which
is
one
ground
is
the
lessening
of
the
state,
the
misspending
of
money.
ansd
i
think
that
in
the
hands
of
a
ministerial
official
without
notice
and
hearing
is
one
such
instance
of
violation
of
not
only
procedural
but
substantive
due
process.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
well,
we
saw
that
there
was
no
remedy
by
certiorari
in
the
state
courts.
i
looked
into
that
matter
and
certiorari
would
only
be
permitted
to
review
the
actions
of
an
administrative
tribunal.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes
your
honor
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure
but
that
would
not
cause
the
chief
of
police
to
take
the
notices
down.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
injunction
would
--
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
an
injunction
and
damage
action
would
cause
the
notice
to
be
taken
down
but
the
likelihood
of
success
in
the
damage
action
mr.
justice
white
in
the
state
courts
would
be
much
more
difficult
than
it
would
under
the
civil
rights
act
where
there
is
definite
state
action.
under
the
state
law
that
would
probably
be
the
requirements
of
probing
matters
beyond
state
action.
and
as
a
result
it
was
our
position
that
it
would
be
an
easier
damage
action
to
prove
in
a
federal
action
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
i
don’t
know.
he
took
that
deposition
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
s.
a.
schapiro
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
in
the
record
downstairs.
