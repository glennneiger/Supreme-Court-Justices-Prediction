the
plaintiff
here
is
a
woman.
i
fail
to
note
the
presence
of
the
word
husband
in
the
statute
although
the
word
wife
is
there,
under
the
wisconsin
system
could
a
husband
post
his
wife?
justice
hugo

does
this
raise
an
equal
protection
argument?
justice

may
i
ask
whether
am
i
correct
in
my

for
tendencies
of
this
