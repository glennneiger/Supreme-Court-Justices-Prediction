justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
--
are
there
any
other
findings
here
as
to
this
petitioner
has
said
must
precede
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
there’s
no
where
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
gather
what
you
told
us
this
scheme
requires
the
police
chief
or
some
other
official
to
make
these
findings
before
the
note
is
sent?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
it
(inaudible)
that
he
in
fact
made
an
appointment?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
call
it
a
review?
i
mean,
why
do
you
need
to
be
limited
to
a
review?
couldn’t
you
bring
an
independent
action
for
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
wisconsin
state
courts
and
sue
the
police
chief
and
tell
him
to
revoke
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
be
as
effective
as
a
common
moment
certiorari
to
be
more
effective
at
least
you
get
a
decision
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
except
with
the
--
except
the
people
to
whom
the
notices
are
mailed
and
i
suppose
there’s
more
than
one.
i
know
that
the
police,
the
chief
has
an
opinion
and
here’s
someone
who
shouldn’t
drink.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
know
what
the
statute
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
know
what
triggers
a
notice
like
that?
i
mean
the
recipients
of
that
notice
are
aware
of
what
triggers
a
notice
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
statement
of
judgmental
means
mr.
southwick?
i’m
looking
at
page
115
of
the
appendix.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
january
23,
defendant
grager(ph)
in
his
capacity
as
the
chief
of
police
acting
in
so
forth
posted
a
notice
in
the
retailed
liquor
outlets
in
the
city
of
hartford,
wisconsin?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
what
did
the
judgmental
do
you
think
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
weren’t
using
it
anyway
in
terms
of
some
notice
being
posted
in
public
places?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
injunction
entered
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
injunction
entered
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
declared
as
constitutional,
wasn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn’t
the
police
chief
be
in
violation
to
this
order
if
he
posted
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
shoud
entitled
the
state
to
deprive
a
person
of
wherever
he
goes
to
a
bar
to
get
without
a
notice
in
the
hearing
when
the
state
can't
have
a
law
which
permits
into
the
--
deprive
that
his
wages
without
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
can
deprive
and
what
the
state
thinks
not
important
but
what
he
might
think
is
very
important.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
state
could
just
post
a
man
and
say
a
teller
on
the
department
stores
in
town,
don’t
sell
this
man
any
more
shoes?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not,
are
those
so
important?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
posted
and
send
a
notice
and
tell
the
stores
“don’t
sell
this
man
anymore
shot
gun
shells.”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
have
the
notice
in
the
hearing
before
you
could
be
deprived
of
--
by
a
gun
shot
shell.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
you
don’t
know
of
anyone
who
has
ever
brought
an
action
except
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
don’t
you
have
to
say
that
the
right
to
regulate
sale
of
liquor
is
absolute
right
in
order
to
sustain
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’ve
got
to
be
absolute
if
you
don’t
have
to
give
any
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
aren’t
there
limitations
to
what
you’ve
just
said
that
one
can
be
committed
for
the
most
states
anyway
for
being
waster
of
his
substance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
you
declare
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face
then
until
you
find
out
how
it’s
been
applied
because
on
its
face
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
posting.
it
says
mailing
a
notice.
and
i
think
it’s
your
intention
is
that
you
must
construe
that
the
statute
was
validly
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
you
must
assume
these
notices
go
on
the
wall?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
some
people
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
the
statute
were
constitutional
i
suppose
that
a
damage
action
might
be
possible
for
the
way
it
mannered
in
which
its
been
administered?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
damage
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
