mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
sustaining
a
conviction
for
refusal
to
report
for
induction.
the
defense
of
course
is
the
question
whether
the
order
to
report
for
induction
was
valid.
in
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
now
stands
that
turns
on
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
selective
service
system
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
conscientious
objection.
the
claim
was
duly
filed
on
the
system's
form
ss150
and
was
considered
by
the
local
board
in
kentucky
and
was
denied
by
that
board.
the
petitioner
here
took
an
appeal
from
that
decision
and
under
the
procedure
which
was
then
established
by
law,
the
matter
was
referred
to
a
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
statute
provided
upon
the
filing
of
such
appeal,
“the
appeal
board
shall
refer
any
such
claim
to
the
department
of
justice
for
inquiry
and
hearing.
the
department
of
justice
after
appropriate
inquiry
shall
hold
a
hearing.”
and
then
it
provided
that
the
department
should
make
its
report
to
the
appeal
board
either
way
and
said
--
the
statute
said,
“the
appeal
board
shall
in
making
its
decision,
give
consideration
to,
but
shall
not
be
bound
to
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
department
of
justice
together
with
the
record
on
appeal
from
the
local
board.”
that
procedure
was
followed
here.
there
was
a
hearing
conducted
by
an
able
and
experienced
hearing
officer.
he
made
his
report,
including
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
and
a
voluminous
number
of
exhibits
to
the
department
of
justice
where
it
was
reviewed
along
with
the
experience
which
the
department's
officers
had
from
reviewing
many
other
hearings
in
this
type
of
matter.
and
the
department
of
justice
prepared
its
letter
of
advice
which
appears
in
the
record,
beginning
on
page
112
and
running
for
16
pages,
in
which
it
recommended
against
the
allowance
of
the
conscientious
objector
claim.
now
that
was
approved
by
the
appeal
board
in
kentucky.
it
was
later
approved
by
an
appeal
board
in
texas.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
so
called
presidential
board,
and
it
was
approved
by
the
presidential
board.
thereafter,
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
and
there
were
decisions
sustaining
the
action
of
the
department
of
justice
advice
letter
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
case
is
now
here
on
the
grant
of
certiorari
limited
to
the
question
of
the
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
welsh
case.
now,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer
is
in
the
appendix,
but
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
what
the
nature
of
that
hearing
was.
it
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
the
government
was
not
represented
except
through
the
hearing
officer
who
its
perfectly
plain,
acted
in
the
most
impartial
way
and
asked
questions
for
the
purpose
of
clarifying
things
for
his
own
mind,
but
not
in
an
adversary
way.
no
evidence
was
offered
on
behalf
of
the
government
at
this
hearing,
either
with
respect
to
the
beliefs
of
the
black
muslim
sect,
or
with
respect
to
the
beliefs
of
the
petitioner,
except
insofar
as
that
may
appear
from
the
resume'
of
the
fbi
report
which
was
made
a
part
of
the
hearing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
hearing
officer
appointed
by
the
department
of
justice
who
held
a
hearing
in
louisville,
kentucky.
in
this
situation
it's
perhaps
surprising
that
there
is
as
much
evidence
as
there
is
of
the
selective
nature
of
the
petitioner's
objections.
there
has
been
one
other
case
before
the
court,
involving
a
black
muslim.
that's
the
case
of
united
states
against
carson,
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
396
u.s.,
865
and
where
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
in
opposition
took
the
ground
that
the
objection
of
the
black
muslim
was
essentially
a
selective
objection
and
i
can
refer
on
that
connection
to
what
this
court
said
in
its
recent
gillette
opinion.
there
is
danger
that
is
between
two
would
be
objectors,
both
having
the
same
complaint
against
the
war,
that
objector
would
succeed
who
is
more
articulate,
better
educated
or
better
counseled.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
fully
agree
it
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
it
is
the
beliefs
of
this
individual,
except
that
in
this
case,
this
individual
has
stated
unequivocally
that
he
accepts
the
beliefs
of
the
sect,
and
there
has
been
introduced
at
the
hearing
as
establishing
his
beliefs.
documents
showing
the
beliefs
of
the
sects
and
of
the
sect
and
i
don't
see
how
he
can
disassociate
himself
from
these
materials
which
he
has
offered
in
support
of
his
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
he
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
had
not
only
incorporated
there
all
by
reference,
he
said
“i
stand
on
it”
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
his
not
merely
incidental
background.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
now
if
the
court
in
this
case
reads
and
examines
all
of
the
evidence,
it
will
be
able
to
make
whatever
finding
it
feels
is
appropriate.
if
it
thinks
that
is
what
it
should
do
and
it
can't
be
said
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
whatever
finding
is
made
here.
it
can't
be
said
that
there's
no
basis
and
fact
for
whatever
conclusion
a
trier
of
the
facts
may
be.
but
this
is
a
question
in
which
congress
has
provided
in
the
statute
that
the
judgment
of
the
draft
board
shall
be
final.
and
the
court
has
said
that
the
standard
of
review
is
no
basis
in
fact.
many
years
ago
in
the
estep
case,
the
court
said
and
i
read
from
the
opinion;
referring
to
the
provision
for
finality
in
the
statute.
“it
means
that
the
courts
are
not
to
weigh
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
classification
made
by
the
local
boards
was
justified.
the
decision
of
the
local
boards
made
in
conformity
with
the
regulations
are
final,
even
though
they
maybe
erroneous.
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
local
board
is
reached
only
if
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
classification.”
and
so
i
take
it
that
the
question
here
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
fact,
not
whether
the
balance
of
the
evidence
having
in
mind
among
other
things
that
this
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding
should
go
one
way
or
another,
but
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
fact
for
the
decisions
which
have
been
reached
by
the
administrative
agencies
and
by
the
courts
below.
and
then
i
would
call
attention
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
witmer
case
in
348
u.s.
where
the
court
said
“it
is
well
to
remember
that
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
sit
as
super
draft
boards
substituting
their
judgments
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
for
those
of
the
designated
agencies,
nor
should
they
look
for
substantial
evidence
to
support
such
determinations.
the
classification
can
be
overturned
only
if
it
has
no
basis
in
fact.”
here,
the
determination
has
been
made
by
the
draft
board,
approved
by
two
state
appeal
boards
by
the
national
appeals
board.
and
if
the
court
follows
the
“no
basis
in
fact”
standard
of
review,
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
decisions
made
by
all
of
the
agencies
of
the
selective
service
system,
and
by
the
two
courts
below.
the
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
our
position
is
that
the
question
of
sincerity
is
not
before
the
court
now,
not
having
been
raised
in
the
petition
and
not
being
covered
by
the
grant
of
certiorari.
we
think
that
the
question
of
sincerity
was
properly
entered
at
an
earlier
stage,
and
that
some
of
the
materials
to
which
the
petitioner
objects
in
the
department
of
justice's
hearing
letter
were
entirely
relevant
pursuant
to
the
witmer
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
believe
that
the
only
one
that
is
before
the
court
now
is
the
latter
one.
that
is
the
only
question
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
only
question
that
is
covered
by
the
grant
of
certiorari,
whether
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
vacated
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
welsh,
because
the
denial
to
petitioner
of
a
conscientious
objector
exemption
may
have
been
based
upon
the
department
of
justice's
erroneous
characterization
of
his
objections
to
participation
in
wars
as
political
and
racial.
rather
than
religious.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
believe
it
does
just
as
in
the
negre
case.
i
think
this
case
has
been
in
effect
decided
by
the
negre
case
and
that
it
is
in
fact
indistinguishable
from
the
negre
case.
now,
let
us
look
back
at
the
negre
case.
there
is
a
case
where
the
objection
was
undeniably
religious.
nobody
questioned
from
beginning
to
end
that
mr.
negre
was
anything,
but
a
sincere
and
devout
catholic
deriving
his
beliefs
from
instruction
in
the
church
and
from
teachings
of
the
fathers.
he
believed
on
undoubtedly
religious
grounds
that
it
was
his
duty
to
participate
in
just
wars,
and
his
duty
not
to
participate
in
unjust
wars.
now,
the
government
never
contended
in
anyway
that
his
objections
were
other
than
religious
in
nature,
nevertheless,
the
government
did
contend
that
they
were
political
and
practical.
this
is
a
contention
within
the
concept
of
religion.
the
government's
arguments
sustained
by
the
court
is
that
it
is
not
enough
that
the
objection
be
religious,
but
it
must
also
be
an
objection
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
and
without
that,
the
court's
discussion
of
the
establishment
and
the
free
exercises
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
in
its
opinion,
a
very
constructive
and
helpful
discussion
would
have
been
wholly
unnecessary
because
it
is
--
that
is
relevant
only
if
the
objections
are
clearly
religious,
and
so
they
were
and
so
we
concede
here
that
the
objections
are
religious.
but
the
distinction
between
just
and
unjust
wars,
those
surely
having
a
religious
basis
in
negre's
mind
injected
political
and
philosophical
considerations
into
the
picture.
and
it
was
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
matter
that
the
government
contended
in
its
brief
that
negre's
position
involvement
a
judgment
that
is
“political
and
particular,”
that
was
one
“based
on
the
same
political,
sociological
and
economic
factors
that
the
government
necessarily
considered”
in
deciding
to
undertake
the
war
and
those
passages
from
the
government's
brief
are
quoted
by
the
court
in
its
opinion.
and
similarly
here,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
petitioner's
claim
is
not
religious
and
we
never
have
contended
that
his
claim
is
not
religious.
the
contention
that
it
is
political
and
racial
is
not
necessarily
a
contention
that
it
is
not
religious.
it
is
a
contention
which
is
entirely
consistent
with
its
being
religious.
if
a
man
sincerely
believes
that
he
can
participate
in
racial
wars
or
in
just
wars,
he
is
not
a
person
who
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
there
is
in
this
record
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner's
objection,
though
religious,
is
selective.
now
that
is
that
he
is
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
as
statute
requires,
but
that
is
in
fact
to
oppose
to
fighting
what
he
regards
as
the
white
man's
wars,
although
having
no
religious
or
conscientious
scruples
against
participation
in
war
which
would
defend
the
black
man's
interest.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
we
do
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
not
mr.
justice.
we
assert
that
it
was
religiously
rooted,
just
as
we
did
in
negre.
no
one
could
conceivably
have
contended
in
negre
that
his
objection
was
not
religious.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
petitioner
just
doesn't
want
to
fight
the
white
man's
wars,
and
i
can
understand
that.
but
it's
not
the
same
sort
of
belief
as
the
opposition
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
which
is
held
by
the
pacifist,
and
is
required
by
the
statute.
now
surely
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
traditional,
historical
muslim
religion
is
not
pacifist.
one
need
only
refer
to
the
crusades
and
to
the
more
recent
seven
days
war
is
adequate
evidence
of
that
fact.
and
although
my
--
counsel
for
the
petitioner
here
differentiated
his
client
from
the
traditional
muslims,
i
would
point
out
that
they
introduced
an
evidence
in
support
of
his
position
a
modern
standard
translation
of
the
qur'an,
a
translation
by
a
pakistani,
not
by
a
member
of
the
black
muslims.
it's
equally
sure
it
seems
to
me
that
the
black
muslim
religion
is
not
regarded
as
pacifist,
in
the
sense
at
least
that
the
quakers
and
the
mennonites
are
pacifists.
as
this
record
shows,
there
are
strong
racial
undertones
in
the
black
muslim
religion,
and
in
the
petitioner's
beliefs.
now,
there
is
thus
a
basis
in
fact
for
a
conclusion
exactly
parallel
to
that
already
reached
by
the
court
in
negre
that
the
objections
of
the
petitioner
here,
though
undoubtedly
religious
as
negre's
were
are
in
fact
selected.
a
different
selection
to
be
sure
than
that
made
by
negre,
but
nevertheless
selective,
and
thus
not
within
the
statutory
prescription
which
allows
conscientious
objection
to
those
who
are
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
would
not
be
opposed
to
wars
in
which
the
black
muslims
were
attacked
or
involved,
and
nor
would
he
be
opposed
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
presumably
be
some
kind
of
a
civil
war,
but
might
not
necessarily
be.
again
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
went
to
the
middle
east,
was
accorded
the
great
distinction
of
being
allowed
to
enter
the
temple
at
mecca.
his
disassociation
with
the
traditional
muslim
religion
is
by
no
means
complete,
and
it's
by
no
means
clear
that
if
the
domestic
hierarchy
of
the
black
muslims
decided
that
its
members
should
participate
in
general
muslim
wars
that
he
would
not
participate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
he
says
so.
he
says
specifically
that
if
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
if
elijah
muhammad
ordered
him
to
do
so,
which
he
didn't
think
he
would,
but
if
elijah
muhammad
ordered
him
to
do
so,
he
would
and
that
i
think
is
inconsistent
with
a
pacifist
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
shall
refer
to
some
parts
of
the
record
which
i
think
will
support
the
fact
that
there
is
a
basis
in
fact
for
saying
that
his
objections
are
selective.
that
is
that
he
is
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
but
that
he
wants
to
pick
and
choose
his
wars,
and
his
pick
is
essentially
a
racial
and
political
choice.
now,
of
course
in
reviewing
the
case,
the
court
will
undoubtedly
give
close
and
careful
attention
to
the
report
or
advice
letter
of
the
department
of
justice.
if
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
one
goes
through
this
letter
looking
for
flaws.
one
can
find
some
matters
that
might
have
been
written
differently.
but
if
the
letter
is
read
from
beginning
to
end
in
its
entirety,
one
will
conclude
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
careful
thoughtful
letter,
written
by
a
responsible
officer,
in
the
special
section
under
department
of
justice
which
was
set
up
for
the
purpose
of
examining
into
these
difficult
questions,
and
which
though
not
binding
on
the
draft
boards,
would
make
a
contribution
toward
thoughtful,
uniform
national
standards
on
these
questions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
believe
a
resume'
or
a
summary
of
it
went
to
the
registrant.
now
three
objections
are
made
to
the
letter
and
they
don't
present
easy
questions
and
if
one
reads
the
petitioner's
brief
alone,
it's
quite
plausible,
particularly
when
one
is
looking
for
flaws.
on
more
careful
examination,
however,
i
believe
that
the
views
expressed
in
the
department
of
justice's
advice
letter
were
sound
and
are
wholly
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
both
before
and
after
the
letter
was
written.
i
think
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
letter
was
written
after
the
seeger
decision,
of
course
before
the
welsh
decision,
but
on
the
whole,
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
welsh
and
the
seeger
decision
in
their
practical
application.
it's
first
said
that
the
department's
conclusion
that
the
petitioner's
beliefs
were
primary,
political
and
racial,
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
i've
already
endeavored
to
view
with
this.
it
is
i
believe
entirely
refuted
by
the
negre
case
itself.
no
one
questioned
that
negre's
views
were
based
on
religious
belief,
yet
they
were
found
by
the
court
to
be
so
political
in
essence,
so
inconsistent
with
the
pacifist
position
which
congress
has
recognized
in
the
statute,
a
pacifist
position
which
need
not
be
based
on
orthodox
religion
as
it
was,
but
nevertheless
must
still
be
a
pacifist
position
that
they
are
not
a
basis
for
exemption
and
the
court
specifically
held
that
this
was
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
similarly
here
as
i've
said,
the
petitioner's
views
are
religious,
that's
not
questioned,
but
they
are
also
selective
just
as
negre's
were.
the
petitioner's
opposition
to
war
is
not
total.
there
are
political
and
racial
exceptions
to
his
objections.
there
may
be
room
to
argue
about
the
evidence
on
this,
but
there
is
much
evidence
that
it
is
so,
and
thus
there
was
an
adequate
basis
in
fact
for
the
conclusions
reached.
probably
the
most
difficult
case
for
us
on
this
point
is
the
sicurella
decision
where
the
court
held
and
we
surely
do
not
disagree
that
the
willingness
of
a
jehovah's
witness
to
participate
at
some
time
in
a
theocratic
war
without
carnal
weapons
was
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
denying
him
exemption
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
now,
there's
some
related
material
in
this
record.
there
is
some
references
to
armageddon
and
to
the
ultimate
battle
of
the
lord
against
the
devil,
and
the
suggestion
that
members
of
the
lost/found
nation
of
islam
must
be
spiritually
prepared
for
the
eventuality.
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
sicurella
surely
is
applicable,
but
there's
also
a
reference
in
this
record
to
a
holy
war.
that's
on
page
68a,
and
here
again
we
will
show
the
tie-end
between
the
petitioner
and
the
traditional
muslim
religion.
this
is
the
petitioner
himself
testifying
at
the
hearing,
“but
the
holy
qur'an
do
teach
us
that
we
do
not
take
part
of
in
any
part
of
war
unless
declared
by
allah
himself,
or
unless
it's
an
islamic
world
war
or
a
holy
war.
and
it
goes
as
far
the
holy
qur'an
is
still
talking,
and
saying
we
are
not
to
even
as
much
as
aid
the
infidels
or
the
none
believers
in
islam,
even
to
as
much
as
handing
them
a
cup
of
water
during
battle.”
and
there
are
other
items
at
this
record
which
support
the
selective
nature
of
the
petitioner's
objection.
page
18,
the
summary
of
his
first
hearing
before
the
board,
clay
objects
to
being
in
service
because
he
has
no
quarrel
with
the
vietcong,
and
page
79a
and
80
of
the
record,
there
is
read
to
him
a
quotation
from
the
chicago
daily
news,
which
he
not
only
says
he
may
but
he
says
he
believes
is
true,
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
79a;
“let
me
tell
you
what
muslims
are
taught,
to
defend
ourselves
when
we
are
attacked.”
now
that's
not
consistent
with
the
pacifist
position,
but
then
continuing
“those
vietcong
are
not
attacking
me.
these
vietcong
are
riding
a
very
nasty
war
over
there.
there's
a
lot
of
people
getting
killed.
why
should
we
muslims
get
involved?
besides,
i'm
fighting
for
the
government
everyday.
i'm
laying
out
my
life
on
the
line
for
the
government.
9
out
of
10
soldiers
would
not
want
to
be
in
my
place
in
the
ring,
it's
too
dangerous.”
now
he
says
later
on
that
he
was
chided
by
elijah
muhammad
for
making
such
a
boastful
statement,
but
he
does
not
deny
that
he
made
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
five
years
i
believe
mr.
justice.
now
whether
that
is
subject
to
reconsideration
under
the
rule,
i
suppose
that
it
is.
then
i
would
call
attention
to
page
165a
of
the
record.
this
is
a
letter
written
by
clay
himself
to
the
draft
board
and
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
hearing
and
for
alliance
from
the
bottom
of
page
165a;
“last
but
not
least,
the
mention
is
the
stand
that
i
took
publishly
as
a
conscientious
objector
to
the
war
in
vietnam.
the
illinois
boxing
commission
challenged
me
and
ruled
that
it
would
permit
me
to
participate
in
the
ernie
terrell
fight
to
defend
my
world
championship
title
which
would
have
brought
me
$2
million,
only
if
i
would
apologize
and
retract
the
words
that
i
stated
publicly
describing
my
conscientious
scruples
against
participation
in
the
war
in
vietnam.”
and
then
finally
on
page
185
of
the
record
is
an
extract
from
a
paper
called
“muhammad
speaks”
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
hearing,
and
this
is
a
statement
of
the
black
muslim
belief.
page
185;
“we
believe
that
we
who
declared
ourselves
to
be
righteous
muslims
should
not
participate
in
wars
which
takes
the
lives
of
humans.
we
do
not
believe
this
nation
should
force
us
to
take
part
in
such
wars
for
we
have
nothing
to
gain
from
it,
unless
america
agrees
to
give
us
the
necessary
territory,
wherein
we
may
have
something
to
fight
for.”
now
there
are
a
number
of
other
passages
in
the
record
to
which
reference
is
made
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
have
to
refer
to
the
brief
for
a
further
discussion
of
these.
if
one
reads
this
letter
like
a
jury
charge,
perhaps
one
can
find
some
error
in
it,
particularly
at
passage
on
page
127
in
the
appendix.
however,
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
so
fairly
taken
out
of
context,
and
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
petitioner's
brief
itself,
it's
referred
--
in
the
petitioner's
petition
at
page
52,
it
is
referred
to
as
an
implication.
it
has
taken
on
greater
strength
in
their
later
arguments.
we
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
materials
presented
and
further
developed
in
our
brief
that
the
record
clearly
presents
the
basis
in
fact
for
the
appeal
board's
decisions.
there's
no
question
about
the
petitioner's
objections
being
religious
in
nature,
and
so
no
question
about
the
welsh
case
is
involved.
insofar
as
there
is
a
question
remaining
in
the
case,
it
is
covered
by
this
court's
long
standing
decision
in
estep
which
established
the
basis
in
fact
rule.
using
the
words
of
the
court
in
witmer
against
the
united
states,
“it
is
the
policy
of
congress
to
make
review
within
this
selective
service
system
final
in
all
cases
where
there
was
conflicting
evidence,
or
where
two
inferences
could
be
drawn
from
the
same
testimony.”
unless
the
court
is
to
sit
as
a
super
draft
board,
it
should
i
submit
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
mr.
justice,
it
has
been.
i'm
sorry
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
so
we
have
all
the
way
along,
mr.
justice.
this
is
nothing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
mr.
justice,
i
think
is
precisely
the
situation
in
the
negre
case.
our
position
in
the
negre
case,
in
those
words
in
our
brief
was
that
negre's
essential
objection
was
political
and
philosophical,
and
though
based
on
religious
grounds
was
not
the
kind
of
religious
objection
which
was
covered
by
the
statute
and
that
is
precisely
the
argument
which
we
make
here.
we
have
never
contended
that
clay's
objections
were
not
religious.
we
have
always
contended
that
the
nature
of
clay's
objections
is
so
infused
with,
so
intertwined
with
political
and
racial
considerations
that
his
religious
objections
do
not
make
the
test
of
the
statute
namely
that
he
is
opposed
to
participate
in
war
in
any
form.
and
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
try
to
develop
my
argument
within
the
terms
of
the
grant
of
certiorari,
believing
or
contending
that
our
position
here
is
exactly
parallel
with
that
in
negre
where
the
contention
was
undoubtedly
religiously
motivated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
sustaining
a
conviction
for
refusal
to
report
for
induction.
the
defense
of
course
is
the
question
whether
the
order
to
report
for
induction
was
valid.
in
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
now
stands
that
turns
on
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
selective
service
system
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
conscientious
objection.
the
claim
was
duly
filed
on
the
system's
form
ss150
and
was
considered
by
the
local
board
in
kentucky
and
was
denied
by
that
board.
the
petitioner
here
took
an
appeal
from
that
decision
and
under
the
procedure
which
was
then
established
by
law,
the
matter
was
referred
to
a
division
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
statute
provided
upon
the
filing
of
such
appeal,
“the
appeal
board
shall
refer
any
such
claim
to
the
department
of
justice
for
inquiry
and
hearing.
the
department
of
justice
after
appropriate
inquiry
shall
hold
a
hearing.”
and
then
it
provided
that
the
department
should
make
its
report
to
the
appeal
board
either
way
and
said
--
the
statute
said,
“the
appeal
board
shall
in
making
its
decision,
give
consideration
to,
but
shall
not
be
bound
to
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
department
of
justice
together
with
the
record
on
appeal
from
the
local
board.”
that
procedure
was
followed
here.
there
was
a
hearing
conducted
by
an
able
and
experienced
hearing
officer.
he
made
his
report,
including
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
and
a
voluminous
number
of
exhibits
to
the
department
of
justice
where
it
was
reviewed
along
with
the
experience
which
the
department's
officers
had
from
reviewing
many
other
hearings
in
this
type
of
matter.
and
the
department
of
justice
prepared
its
letter
of
advice
which
appears
in
the
record,
beginning
on
page
112
and
running
for
16
pages,
in
which
it
recommended
against
the
allowance
of
the
conscientious
objector
claim.
now
that
was
approved
by
the
appeal
board
in
kentucky.
it
was
later
approved
by
an
appeal
board
in
texas.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
so
called
presidential
board,
and
it
was
approved
by
the
presidential
board.
thereafter,
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
and
there
were
decisions
sustaining
the
action
of
the
department
of
justice
advice
letter
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
case
is
now
here
on
the
grant
of
certiorari
limited
to
the
question
of
the
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
welsh
case.
now,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer
is
in
the
appendix,
but
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
what
the
nature
of
that
hearing
was.
it
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
the
government
was
not
represented
except
through
the
hearing
officer
who
its
perfectly
plain,
acted
in
the
most
impartial
way
and
asked
questions
for
the
purpose
of
clarifying
things
for
his
own
mind,
but
not
in
an
adversary
way.
no
evidence
was
offered
on
behalf
of
the
government
at
this
hearing,
either
with
respect
to
the
beliefs
of
the
black
muslim
sect,
or
with
respect
to
the
beliefs
of
the
petitioner,
except
insofar
as
that
may
appear
from
the
resume'
of
the
fbi
report
which
was
made
a
part
of
the
hearing.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
hearing
officer
appointed
by
the
department
of
justice
who
held
a
hearing
in
louisville,
kentucky.
in
this
situation
it's
perhaps
surprising
that
there
is
as
much
evidence
as
there
is
of
the
selective
nature
of
the
petitioner's
objections.
there
has
been
one
other
case
before
the
court,
involving
a
black
muslim.
that's
the
case
of
united
states
against
carson,
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
396
u.s.,
865
and
where
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
in
opposition
took
the
ground
that
the
objection
of
the
black
muslim
was
essentially
a
selective
objection
and
i
can
refer
on
that
connection
to
what
this
court
said
in
its
recent
gillette
opinion.
there
is
danger
that
is
between
two
would
be
objectors,
both
having
the
same
complaint
against
the
war,
that
objector
would
succeed
who
is
more
articulate,
better
educated
or
better
counseled.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
fully
agree
it
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
it
is
the
beliefs
of
this
individual,
except
that
in
this
case,
this
individual
has
stated
unequivocally
that
he
accepts
the
beliefs
of
the
sect,
and
there
has
been
introduced
at
the
hearing
as
establishing
his
beliefs.
documents
showing
the
beliefs
of
the
sects
and
of
the
sect
and
i
don't
see
how
he
can
disassociate
himself
from
these
materials
which
he
has
offered
in
support
of
his
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
he
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
had
not
only
incorporated
there
all
by
reference,
he
said
“i
stand
on
it”
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
his
not
merely
incidental
background.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
now
if
the
court
in
this
case
reads
and
examines
all
of
the
evidence,
it
will
be
able
to
make
whatever
finding
it
feels
is
appropriate.
if
it
thinks
that
is
what
it
should
do
and
it
can't
be
said
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
whatever
finding
is
made
here.
it
can't
be
said
that
there's
no
basis
and
fact
for
whatever
conclusion
a
trier
of
the
facts
may
be.
but
this
is
a
question
in
which
congress
has
provided
in
the
statute
that
the
judgment
of
the
draft
board
shall
be
final.
and
the
court
has
said
that
the
standard
of
review
is
no
basis
in
fact.
many
years
ago
in
the
estep
case,
the
court
said
and
i
read
from
the
opinion;
referring
to
the
provision
for
finality
in
the
statute.
“it
means
that
the
courts
are
not
to
weigh
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
classification
made
by
the
local
boards
was
justified.
the
decision
of
the
local
boards
made
in
conformity
with
the
regulations
are
final,
even
though
they
maybe
erroneous.
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
local
board
is
reached
only
if
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
classification.”
and
so
i
take
it
that
the
question
here
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
fact,
not
whether
the
balance
of
the
evidence
having
in
mind
among
other
things
that
this
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding
should
go
one
way
or
another,
but
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
fact
for
the
decisions
which
have
been
reached
by
the
administrative
agencies
and
by
the
courts
below.
and
then
i
would
call
attention
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
witmer
case
in
348
u.s.
where
the
court
said
“it
is
well
to
remember
that
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
sit
as
super
draft
boards
substituting
their
judgments
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
for
those
of
the
designated
agencies,
nor
should
they
look
for
substantial
evidence
to
support
such
determinations.
the
classification
can
be
overturned
only
if
it
has
no
basis
in
fact.”
here,
the
determination
has
been
made
by
the
draft
board,
approved
by
two
state
appeal
boards
by
the
national
appeals
board.
and
if
the
court
follows
the
“no
basis
in
fact”
standard
of
review,
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
decisions
made
by
all
of
the
agencies
of
the
selective
service
system,
and
by
the
two
courts
below.
the
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
our
position
is
that
the
question
of
sincerity
is
not
before
the
court
now,
not
having
been
raised
in
the
petition
and
not
being
covered
by
the
grant
of
certiorari.
we
think
that
the
question
of
sincerity
was
properly
entered
at
an
earlier
stage,
and
that
some
of
the
materials
to
which
the
petitioner
objects
in
the
department
of
justice's
hearing
letter
were
entirely
relevant
pursuant
to
the
witmer
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
believe
that
the
only
one
that
is
before
the
court
now
is
the
latter
one.
that
is
the
only
question
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
only
question
that
is
covered
by
the
grant
of
certiorari,
whether
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
vacated
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
welsh,
because
the
denial
to
petitioner
of
a
conscientious
objector
exemption
may
have
been
based
upon
the
department
of
justice's
erroneous
characterization
of
his
objections
to
participation
in
wars
as
political
and
racial.
rather
than
religious.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
i
believe
it
does
just
as
in
the
negre
case.
i
think
this
case
has
been
in
effect
decided
by
the
negre
case
and
that
it
is
in
fact
indistinguishable
from
the
negre
case.
now,
let
us
look
back
at
the
negre
case.
there
is
a
case
where
the
objection
was
undeniably
religious.
nobody
questioned
from
beginning
to
end
that
mr.
negre
was
anything,
but
a
sincere
and
devout
catholic
deriving
his
beliefs
from
instruction
in
the
church
and
from
teachings
of
the
fathers.
he
believed
on
undoubtedly
religious
grounds
that
it
was
his
duty
to
participate
in
just
wars,
and
his
duty
not
to
participate
in
unjust
wars.
now,
the
government
never
contended
in
anyway
that
his
objections
were
other
than
religious
in
nature,
nevertheless,
the
government
did
contend
that
they
were
political
and
practical.
this
is
a
contention
within
the
concept
of
religion.
the
government's
arguments
sustained
by
the
court
is
that
it
is
not
enough
that
the
objection
be
religious,
but
it
must
also
be
an
objection
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
and
without
that,
the
court's
discussion
of
the
establishment
and
the
free
exercises
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
in
its
opinion,
a
very
constructive
and
helpful
discussion
would
have
been
wholly
unnecessary
because
it
is
--
that
is
relevant
only
if
the
objections
are
clearly
religious,
and
so
they
were
and
so
we
concede
here
that
the
objections
are
religious.
but
the
distinction
between
just
and
unjust
wars,
those
surely
having
a
religious
basis
in
negre's
mind
injected
political
and
philosophical
considerations
into
the
picture.
and
it
was
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
matter
that
the
government
contended
in
its
brief
that
negre's
position
involvement
a
judgment
that
is
“political
and
particular,”
that
was
one
“based
on
the
same
political,
sociological
and
economic
factors
that
the
government
necessarily
considered”
in
deciding
to
undertake
the
war
and
those
passages
from
the
government's
brief
are
quoted
by
the
court
in
its
opinion.
and
similarly
here,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
petitioner's
claim
is
not
religious
and
we
never
have
contended
that
his
claim
is
not
religious.
the
contention
that
it
is
political
and
racial
is
not
necessarily
a
contention
that
it
is
not
religious.
it
is
a
contention
which
is
entirely
consistent
with
its
being
religious.
if
a
man
sincerely
believes
that
he
can
participate
in
racial
wars
or
in
just
wars,
he
is
not
a
person
who
is
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
there
is
in
this
record
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner's
objection,
though
religious,
is
selective.
now
that
is
that
he
is
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
as
statute
requires,
but
that
is
in
fact
to
oppose
to
fighting
what
he
regards
as
the
white
man's
wars,
although
having
no
religious
or
conscientious
scruples
against
participation
in
war
which
would
defend
the
black
man's
interest.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
we
do
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
certainly
not
mr.
justice.
we
assert
that
it
was
religiously
rooted,
just
as
we
did
in
negre.
no
one
could
conceivably
have
contended
in
negre
that
his
objection
was
not
religious.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
petitioner
just
doesn't
want
to
fight
the
white
man's
wars,
and
i
can
understand
that.
but
it's
not
the
same
sort
of
belief
as
the
opposition
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
which
is
held
by
the
pacifist,
and
is
required
by
the
statute.
now
surely
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
traditional,
historical
muslim
religion
is
not
pacifist.
one
need
only
refer
to
the
crusades
and
to
the
more
recent
seven
days
war
is
adequate
evidence
of
that
fact.
and
although
my
--
counsel
for
the
petitioner
here
differentiated
his
client
from
the
traditional
muslims,
i
would
point
out
that
they
introduced
an
evidence
in
support
of
his
position
a
modern
standard
translation
of
the
qur'an,
a
translation
by
a
pakistani,
not
by
a
member
of
the
black
muslims.
it's
equally
sure
it
seems
to
me
that
the
black
muslim
religion
is
not
regarded
as
pacifist,
in
the
sense
at
least
that
the
quakers
and
the
mennonites
are
pacifists.
as
this
record
shows,
there
are
strong
racial
undertones
in
the
black
muslim
religion,
and
in
the
petitioner's
beliefs.
now,
there
is
thus
a
basis
in
fact
for
a
conclusion
exactly
parallel
to
that
already
reached
by
the
court
in
negre
that
the
objections
of
the
petitioner
here,
though
undoubtedly
religious
as
negre's
were
are
in
fact
selected.
a
different
selection
to
be
sure
than
that
made
by
negre,
but
nevertheless
selective,
and
thus
not
within
the
statutory
prescription
which
allows
conscientious
objection
to
those
who
are
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
would
not
be
opposed
to
wars
in
which
the
black
muslims
were
attacked
or
involved,
and
nor
would
he
be
opposed
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
presumably
be
some
kind
of
a
civil
war,
but
might
not
necessarily
be.
again
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
went
to
the
middle
east,
was
accorded
the
great
distinction
of
being
allowed
to
enter
the
temple
at
mecca.
his
disassociation
with
the
traditional
muslim
religion
is
by
no
means
complete,
and
it's
by
no
means
clear
that
if
the
domestic
hierarchy
of
the
black
muslims
decided
that
its
members
should
participate
in
general
muslim
wars
that
he
would
not
participate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
he
says
so.
he
says
specifically
that
if
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
if
elijah
muhammad
ordered
him
to
do
so,
which
he
didn't
think
he
would,
but
if
elijah
muhammad
ordered
him
to
do
so,
he
would
and
that
i
think
is
inconsistent
with
a
pacifist
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
shall
refer
to
some
parts
of
the
record
which
i
think
will
support
the
fact
that
there
is
a
basis
in
fact
for
saying
that
his
objections
are
selective.
that
is
that
he
is
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
but
that
he
wants
to
pick
and
choose
his
wars,
and
his
pick
is
essentially
a
racial
and
political
choice.
now,
of
course
in
reviewing
the
case,
the
court
will
undoubtedly
give
close
and
careful
attention
to
the
report
or
advice
letter
of
the
department
of
justice.
if
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
one
goes
through
this
letter
looking
for
flaws.
one
can
find
some
matters
that
might
have
been
written
differently.
but
if
the
letter
is
read
from
beginning
to
end
in
its
entirety,
one
will
conclude
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
careful
thoughtful
letter,
written
by
a
responsible
officer,
in
the
special
section
under
department
of
justice
which
was
set
up
for
the
purpose
of
examining
into
these
difficult
questions,
and
which
though
not
binding
on
the
draft
boards,
would
make
a
contribution
toward
thoughtful,
uniform
national
standards
on
these
questions.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
believe
a
resume'
or
a
summary
of
it
went
to
the
registrant.
now
three
objections
are
made
to
the
letter
and
they
don't
present
easy
questions
and
if
one
reads
the
petitioner's
brief
alone,
it's
quite
plausible,
particularly
when
one
is
looking
for
flaws.
on
more
careful
examination,
however,
i
believe
that
the
views
expressed
in
the
department
of
justice's
advice
letter
were
sound
and
are
wholly
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
both
before
and
after
the
letter
was
written.
i
think
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
letter
was
written
after
the
seeger
decision,
of
course
before
the
welsh
decision,
but
on
the
whole,
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
welsh
and
the
seeger
decision
in
their
practical
application.
it's
first
said
that
the
department's
conclusion
that
the
petitioner's
beliefs
were
primary,
political
and
racial,
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
i've
already
endeavored
to
view
with
this.
it
is
i
believe
entirely
refuted
by
the
negre
case
itself.
no
one
questioned
that
negre's
views
were
based
on
religious
belief,
yet
they
were
found
by
the
court
to
be
so
political
in
essence,
so
inconsistent
with
the
pacifist
position
which
congress
has
recognized
in
the
statute,
a
pacifist
position
which
need
not
be
based
on
orthodox
religion
as
it
was,
but
nevertheless
must
still
be
a
pacifist
position
that
they
are
not
a
basis
for
exemption
and
the
court
specifically
held
that
this
was
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
similarly
here
as
i've
said,
the
petitioner's
views
are
religious,
that's
not
questioned,
but
they
are
also
selective
just
as
negre's
were.
the
petitioner's
opposition
to
war
is
not
total.
there
are
political
and
racial
exceptions
to
his
objections.
there
may
be
room
to
argue
about
the
evidence
on
this,
but
there
is
much
evidence
that
it
is
so,
and
thus
there
was
an
adequate
basis
in
fact
for
the
conclusions
reached.
probably
the
most
difficult
case
for
us
on
this
point
is
the
sicurella
decision
where
the
court
held
and
we
surely
do
not
disagree
that
the
willingness
of
a
jehovah's
witness
to
participate
at
some
time
in
a
theocratic
war
without
carnal
weapons
was
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
denying
him
exemption
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
opposed
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form.
now,
there's
some
related
material
in
this
record.
there
is
some
references
to
armageddon
and
to
the
ultimate
battle
of
the
lord
against
the
devil,
and
the
suggestion
that
members
of
the
lost/found
nation
of
islam
must
be
spiritually
prepared
for
the
eventuality.
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
sicurella
surely
is
applicable,
but
there's
also
a
reference
in
this
record
to
a
holy
war.
that's
on
page
68a,
and
here
again
we
will
show
the
tie-end
between
the
petitioner
and
the
traditional
muslim
religion.
this
is
the
petitioner
himself
testifying
at
the
hearing,
“but
the
holy
qur'an
do
teach
us
that
we
do
not
take
part
of
in
any
part
of
war
unless
declared
by
allah
himself,
or
unless
it's
an
islamic
world
war
or
a
holy
war.
and
it
goes
as
far
the
holy
qur'an
is
still
talking,
and
saying
we
are
not
to
even
as
much
as
aid
the
infidels
or
the
none
believers
in
islam,
even
to
as
much
as
handing
them
a
cup
of
water
during
battle.”
and
there
are
other
items
at
this
record
which
support
the
selective
nature
of
the
petitioner's
objection.
page
18,
the
summary
of
his
first
hearing
before
the
board,
clay
objects
to
being
in
service
because
he
has
no
quarrel
with
the
vietcong,
and
page
79a
and
80
of
the
record,
there
is
read
to
him
a
quotation
from
the
chicago
daily
news,
which
he
not
only
says
he
may
but
he
says
he
believes
is
true,
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
79a;
“let
me
tell
you
what
muslims
are
taught,
to
defend
ourselves
when
we
are
attacked.”
now
that's
not
consistent
with
the
pacifist
position,
but
then
continuing
“those
vietcong
are
not
attacking
me.
these
vietcong
are
riding
a
very
nasty
war
over
there.
there's
a
lot
of
people
getting
killed.
why
should
we
muslims
get
involved?
besides,
i'm
fighting
for
the
government
everyday.
i'm
laying
out
my
life
on
the
line
for
the
government.
9
out
of
10
soldiers
would
not
want
to
be
in
my
place
in
the
ring,
it's
too
dangerous.”
now
he
says
later
on
that
he
was
chided
by
elijah
muhammad
for
making
such
a
boastful
statement,
but
he
does
not
deny
that
he
made
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
five
years
i
believe
mr.
justice.
now
whether
that
is
subject
to
reconsideration
under
the
rule,
i
suppose
that
it
is.
then
i
would
call
attention
to
page
165a
of
the
record.
this
is
a
letter
written
by
clay
himself
to
the
draft
board
and
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
hearing
and
for
alliance
from
the
bottom
of
page
165a;
“last
but
not
least,
the
mention
is
the
stand
that
i
took
publishly
as
a
conscientious
objector
to
the
war
in
vietnam.
the
illinois
boxing
commission
challenged
me
and
ruled
that
it
would
permit
me
to
participate
in
the
ernie
terrell
fight
to
defend
my
world
championship
title
which
would
have
brought
me
$2
million,
only
if
i
would
apologize
and
retract
the
words
that
i
stated
publicly
describing
my
conscientious
scruples
against
participation
in
the
war
in
vietnam.”
and
then
finally
on
page
185
of
the
record
is
an
extract
from
a
paper
called
“muhammad
speaks”
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
hearing,
and
this
is
a
statement
of
the
black
muslim
belief.
page
185;
“we
believe
that
we
who
declared
ourselves
to
be
righteous
muslims
should
not
participate
in
wars
which
takes
the
lives
of
humans.
we
do
not
believe
this
nation
should
force
us
to
take
part
in
such
wars
for
we
have
nothing
to
gain
from
it,
unless
america
agrees
to
give
us
the
necessary
territory,
wherein
we
may
have
something
to
fight
for.”
now
there
are
a
number
of
other
passages
in
the
record
to
which
reference
is
made
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
have
to
refer
to
the
brief
for
a
further
discussion
of
these.
if
one
reads
this
letter
like
a
jury
charge,
perhaps
one
can
find
some
error
in
it,
particularly
at
passage
on
page
127
in
the
appendix.
however,
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
so
fairly
taken
out
of
context,
and
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
petitioner's
brief
itself,
it's
referred
--
in
the
petitioner's
petition
at
page
52,
it
is
referred
to
as
an
implication.
it
has
taken
on
greater
strength
in
their
later
arguments.
we
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
materials
presented
and
further
developed
in
our
brief
that
the
record
clearly
presents
the
basis
in
fact
for
the
appeal
board's
decisions.
there's
no
question
about
the
petitioner's
objections
being
religious
in
nature,
and
so
no
question
about
the
welsh
case
is
involved.
insofar
as
there
is
a
question
remaining
in
the
case,
it
is
covered
by
this
court's
long
standing
decision
in
estep
which
established
the
basis
in
fact
rule.
using
the
words
of
the
court
in
witmer
against
the
united
states,
“it
is
the
policy
of
congress
to
make
review
within
this
selective
service
system
final
in
all
cases
where
there
was
conflicting
evidence,
or
where
two
inferences
could
be
drawn
from
the
same
testimony.”
unless
the
court
is
to
sit
as
a
super
draft
board,
it
should
i
submit
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
mr.
justice,
it
has
been.
i'm
sorry
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
so
we
have
all
the
way
along,
mr.
justice.
this
is
nothing
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
mr.
justice,
i
think
is
precisely
the
situation
in
the
negre
case.
our
position
in
the
negre
case,
in
those
words
in
our
brief
was
that
negre's
essential
objection
was
political
and
philosophical,
and
though
based
on
religious
grounds
was
not
the
kind
of
religious
objection
which
was
covered
by
the
statute
and
that
is
precisely
the
argument
which
we
make
here.
we
have
never
contended
that
clay's
objections
were
not
religious.
we
have
always
contended
that
the
nature
of
clay's
objections
is
so
infused
with,
so
intertwined
with
political
and
racial
considerations
that
his
religious
objections
do
not
make
the
test
of
the
statute
namely
that
he
is
opposed
to
participate
in
war
in
any
form.
and
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
try
to
develop
my
argument
within
the
terms
of
the
grant
of
certiorari,
believing
or
contending
that
our
position
here
is
exactly
parallel
with
that
in
negre
where
the
contention
was
undoubtedly
religiously
motivated.
