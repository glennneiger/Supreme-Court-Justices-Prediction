the

i'm
talking
about
the
jihad
which
is
in
the
qur'an
as
a
war
that
the
qur'an
embraces
as
the
kind
of

i
didn't
agree
with
the
court
in
the
negre
case,

i'm
just
wondering
the
relevancy
of
that
here?
justice
william

i
think
the
mediterranean
literal
has
seen
jihads,
well
maybe
not
for
several
hundred
years,

historically
they've
been
quite
a
few,
haven't
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
well
i'm
not
trying
to
attribute
to
the
black
muslims
this
teaching
of
the
qur'an
because
i
just
don't
know,
but
my
question
is
does
the
record
show
what
the
black
muslims
believe
in
this
respect?
