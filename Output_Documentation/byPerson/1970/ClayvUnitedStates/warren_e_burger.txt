e.

thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
eskridge,
we'll
enlarge
your
time
by
two
minutes
in
light
of
our
extension
for
the
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
before
you
get
underway
and
avoid
an
interruption
perhaps.
at
the
185
of
the
appendix,
the
belief
recited
“we
do
not
believe
this
nation,”
that
is
the
united
states,
the
reference
is
there,
“should
force
us
to
take
part
in
such
wars
where
we
have
nothing
to
gain
from
it
unless
it
agrees
to
give
us
the
necessary
territory,
wherein
we
may
have
something
to
fight
for.”
would
it
be
an
unreasonable
inference
from
that
statement
of
belief
that
if
for
example,
hypothetically,
even
though
unlikely,
there
were
some
kind
of
an
agreement
to
give
hawaii
or
texas
or
alaska
or
some
other
area
to
the
black
muslim
nation
that
then
they
would
fight?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
a
reasonable
inference
to
draw
from
that
statement
of
belief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
does
it
mean?
“we
have
nothing
to
gain
in
taking
part
in
such
wars,
unless
america
agrees
to
gives
this
something
like
this.”
isn't
that
a
conditional
offer
to
fight
under
some
conditions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
then
it
would
be
irrational
on
the
record
for
the
draft
board
and
appeal
board
to
have
read
this
paragraph
that
i
quoted
to
you
as
a
conditional
refusal
only?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.

concluded
