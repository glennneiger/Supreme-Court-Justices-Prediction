justice
potter
stewart
well,
muslim
as
i
understand
it
is
the
nation
of
islam,
really
has
no
--
certainly
cannot
be
acquainted
with
the
muslim
religion
in
such
nations
as
iran
and
pakistan
and
the
arab
countries
of
the
middle
east.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
different.
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn't
it
not
pre-largely
confined
to
north
america,
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
so
when
there's
talk
of
the
defense
of
islam,
we're
not
talking
necessarily
about
a
war
in
which
a
muslim
country
would
be
involved
in,
such
as
iran
or
pakistan?
justice
potter
stewart
a
temporal
kind
of
a
war
where
the
defensive
islam
means
the,
as
i
gather
from
the
record,
the
defense
of
those
who
are
adherence
to
this
religion?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
the
personal
defense,
isn't
that
correct,
self
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
talk
though
about
learning
karate
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
which
involve
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
personal
or
self
defense,
i
suppose,
not
rather
than
war?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
its
common
ground
however
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
not,
that
the
dispositive
question
is
the
particularized
beliefs
of
this
individual
registrant,
or
that
individual
registrant
rather
than
the
basic
tenants
of
the
religious
sect
to
which
he
adheres?
justice
potter
stewart
and
both
ways,
there
are
two
sides
to
that
coin?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
he
could
or
should,
but
he
didn't
confine
himself
to
that,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
incorporate
all
that
by
reference
and
then
now
he
said
now
he
added
a
few
things.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
rather
a
starting
point,
wasn't
it?
he
went
on
from
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
so
i
can
be
clear,
as
i
follow
your
argument,
the
basis
in
fact
i
suppose
was
not
like
the
witmer
case
based
on
the
applicant's
insincerity,
lack
of
sincerity,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
i'm
interested
in
learning
is
what
among
the
various
possible
basis,
what
was
the
basis
in
fact?
now
the
various
possible
basis,
at
least
in
this
case
were;
(a)
that
he
was
insincere;
(b)
that
his
objection
was
not
religiously
rooted
or
grounded;
(c)
that
his
objection
was
selective,
and
it
was
not
to
war
in
any
form,
but
to
particularize
to
particular
war,
some
wars,
but
not
other
wars,
there
maybe
others.
but
which
of
those
first
three
(voice
overlap)
basis
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
selective
objection?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
we're
not
involved
with
selective
objection,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
nor
as
i
understand
that
the
fact
that
it
was
religiously
rooted,
religiously
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
--
i
assume
that
you
are
going
to
deal
with
the
sicurella
case,
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
potter
stewart
very
good.
justice
potter
stewart
to
what
wars
do
you
understand
the
record
shows
that
he
would
not
be
opposed?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
a
civil
war,
wasn't
it?
that
would
necessarily
be
a
civil
war,
if
this
religion
is
pretty
well
confined
in
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
--
i
had
difficulty
with
this.
are
you
submitting
that
this
record
shows
that
this
registrant
would
fight
in
a
war
in
which
say
algeria,
or
jordan,
or
iraq,
or
pakistan
or
iran
were
engaged?
do
you
think
that's
what
--?
justice
potter
stewart
makes
the
islam
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
that
the
nation
of
islam
meant
the
--
those
who
make
up
the
--
who
constitute
this
religious
sect
in
the
united
states
of
america,
just
like
you
would
say
fight
in
defense
in
the
episcopalian
church
or
the
methodist
church?
justice
potter
stewart
but
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
record.
to
me,
this
is
rather
important.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
question,
the
case
you've
argued
is
not
that
that
was
covered
by
our
limited
grant
of
certiorari,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
point
out
that
the
question
to
which
we
limited
this
grant
of
certiorari
was
whether
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
vacated
because
the
denial
to
him
of
a
conscientious
objector
exemption
may
have
been
based
upon
the
department
of
justice's
erroneous
characterization
of
his
objection
to
participation
in
wars
as
political
and
racial,
rather
than
religious.
and
as
i
understand
it,
you've
begun
this
argument
this
morning
by
conceding
that
they
were
religious
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
--
you
argued
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
selective
objector,
which
is
not
the
question
in
which
we
granted
certiorari?
