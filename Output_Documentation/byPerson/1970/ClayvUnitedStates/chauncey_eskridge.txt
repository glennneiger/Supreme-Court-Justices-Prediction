mr.
chauncey
eskridge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
important
case
because
it
poises
the
--
a
famous
athlete,
the
heavyweight
or
ex-heavyweight
champion
of
the
world
against
the
united
states
selective
service
system,
which
treated
him
we
say,
unfairly.
may
it
be
recalled
that
in
february
1964,
the
so
called
louisville
lip,
so
called
because
of
his
loquaciousness
to
say
the
least,
he
just
won
the
championship
of
mid
great
public
acclaim.
he
had
just
announced
that
time
that
he
was
a
so
called
black
muslim.
at
that
time,
they
were
considered
to
be
terrorists
or
subversives
because
the
justice
department
then
was
wiretapping
his
leader,
the
honorable
elijah
mohammed.
well,
soon
after
he
won
the
championship
in
march
of
1964,
it
was
announced
by
the
officials
by
the
selective
service
system
that
he
had
been
given
two
qualifications
test,
and
he
had
failed
both
and
had
been
given
the
classification
of
1-y.
almost
two
years
went
by
and
after
many
reams
of
newspaper
copy,
he
was
then
sent
on
february
3,
1966
a
statement
of
his
acceptability,
this
because
the
selective
service
system
had
lowered
his
qualifications
for
admissions
into
the
armed
forces.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
1-y
means
that
he
is
not
then,
or
that
he'd
only
been
taken
in
case
of
war
or
national
emergency.
on
february
14,
1966,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
local
draft
board,
alleging
facts
which
he
claims
entitled
him
under
the
law
to
several
lower
classifications,
including
that
of
the
conscientious
objector.
without
more,
on
the
february
17,
1966,
his
local
board
reclassified
him.
then
the
next
day,
the
local
board
sent
him
the
usual
form
150,
which
is
the
application
for
a
conscientious
objector.
then
on
the
february
28,
he
sent
the
application
back,
which
showing
on
the
face
of
this
application
what
we
consider
to
be
a
prima
facie
entitlement
to
the
status
of
conscientious
objector.
in
his
handwriting,
he
wrote,
“muslim
means
peace,
total
submission
to
the
will
of
allah,
do
not
take
the
lives
of
anyone,
nor
war
when
ordered
--
when
not
ordered
by
allah”
and
in
parenthesis
he
has
the
word
(god,
keep
our
prayers
and
pay
poor
rates),
that's
quotation
from
his
form
150.
and
the
form
50
maybe
found
in
page
17a
of
the
appendix
--
i'm
sorry,
on
page
12
a
of
the
appendix.
he
then
appeared
before
his
draft
board
on
march
17,
1966
and
the
notes
of
the
clerk
or
the
minutes
of
that
meeting
appear
on
page
17a
of
the
appendix
and
they
will
get
them
important,
because
the
notes
of
the
minutes
of
that
meeting
are
later
quoted
by
the
government
as
being
pertinent
in
this
case.
then
the
appeal
process
starts.
as
you
remember
in
those
days,
you
made
an
--
you
make
an
application
to
the
appeal
board,
and
the
appeal
board
refers
the
matter
to
the
united
states
justice
department,
and
the
united
states
justice
department
at
that
time
appointed
under
the
statute,
a
hearing
officer
who
was
to
have
a
hearing
on
good
faith
and
character
of
the
registrant.
in
this
case,
it
is
important
that
the
hearing
officer
was
an
ex-chief,
an
ex-judge,
a
retired
judge
from
the
system
of
kentucky,
a
man
in
his
60's
and
who
had
been
on
the
bench
many
number
of
years.
and
that
this
judge
had
this
hearing,
his
name
was
judge
grauman.
now,
judge
grauman
heard
several
witnesses.
he
also
had
in
front
of
him,
the
record
shows
that
an
fbi
report
of
about
six
inches.
he
also
was
given
at
the
hearing
two
books,
one
of
which
was
called
the
“message
to
the
black
man”
written
by
the
honorable
elijah
mohammed,
and
another
book
entitled
“the
holy
qur'an”
by
muhammad
ali,
not
our
muhammad
ali,
another
one.
and
there
was
also
introduced
a
copy
of
a
newspaper
that
put
out
by
his
sect,
the
muslims
called
it
the
“muhammad
speaks.”
now,
judge
grauman,
he
had
the
first
opportunity
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
he
could
determine
whether
how
much
credence
to
put
in
the
testimony
of
the
people
in
front
of
him
and
judge
grauman
wrote
his
report,
and
his
report
appears
on
page
17a.
in
some
of
his
notations
in
what
we
call
the
advice
letter
which
is
written
by
the
attorney
general
--
written
by
the
selective
service
system,
i
mean,
the
justice
department
and
this
is
where
we
consider
the
crux
of
this
case
is
in
the
so
called
advice
letter.
now,
the
hearing
officer
wrote
his
report
and
he
concluded
at
page
117a
in
the
appendix
that
the
registrant
is
sincere
in
his
objections
on
religious
ground,
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
he
recommended
that
the
conscientious
objector
claim
of
the
registrant
be
sustained,
notwithstanding.
the
justice
--
at
that
time,
the
justice
department
had
a
conscientious
objector
section
and
all
letters
are
written
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
t.
oscar
smith
who
was
in
charge
of
the
section
and
this
letter
was
written
back
signed
by
t.
oscar
smith.
and
then
after
having
said
that
the
hearing
officer
had
found
the
registrant
sincere,
at
page
128,
he
then
quotes
from
“muhammad
speaks”
seven
lines
from
the
newspaper
“muhammad
speaks.”
then
the
next
paragraph
he
gives,
that
is
the
writer
of
the
letter
gives
his
opinion
of
what
“muhammad
speaks”
says
and
what
“message
of
black
man”
says,
it's
in
the
bottom
of
page
120
and
beginning
121,
then
he
gives
his
opinion.
it
seems
clear
on
reading
these
two
documents
that
the
teachings
of
the
nation
of
islam
precludes
fighting
for
the
united
states,
not
because
of
objections
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
but
rather
because
a
political
and
and
racial
objections
to
policies
the
united
states
as
interpreted
by
elijah
muhammad.
then
he
goes
on
and
he
reads
a
part
of
a
hypothetical
question
which
muhammad
ali,
the
registrant
had
answered
at
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer.
then
he
quotes
part
of
registrant's
testimony,
and
then
he
comes
to
this
conclusion.
“it
is
therefore
our
conclusion
that
the
registrant
claimed
objections
to
participation
of
war
insofar
as
they
are
based
upon
the
teachings
of
the
nation
of
islam
rest
on
grounds
which
are
primarily
political
and
racial.”
now
we
say
that
when
these
men
who
are
on
the
appeal
board,
who
had
to
read
this
advice
letter,
with
this
language,
they
interpret
it
like
we
interpret
it
that
this
is
as
same
as
saying
that
the
--
his
objection
to
the
war
were
based
on
political
or
racial
grounds
and
not
on
his
religion
training
and
belief.
now,
we
understand
that
now
the
government
in
its
brief,
page
30
--
page
27
in
government's
brief,
now
say
that
that
language
was
not
intended
to
say
they
were
not
religious.
now,
the
government
says
that
this
language
was
or
that
muhammad
ali
was
one
who
had
his
belief
rooted
in
religious
training
and
belief.
but
now
they
say
that
political
and
racial
and
if
you
interpret
it,
they
say
that
the
record
infers
the
inference
that
petitioner
would
fight
“tomorrow”
in
a
defensive
war
on
behalf
of
muslims.
this
reminds
us
of
the
case
of
sicurella
where
the
hypothetical
questions
was
put
to
jehovah's
witness,
what
they
would
they
do
if
they
did
so
and
so,
or
if
so
and
so
and
so.
now,
they
have
taken
some
language,
juxtapose
against
other
language,
and
they
come
to
this
conclusion,
but
nowhere
in
the
record
as
the
registrant
ever
said
that
he
would
fight
with
weapons
against
anybody.
now
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes,
sir.
the
holy
war
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
they
adopt
the
qur'an,
especially
the
one
that's
edited
by
muhammad
--
you
see,
there's
two
names;
maulana
muhammad
ali,
that's
their
official
version.
and
it
--
they
use
it
and
they
couple
it
with
the
black
man's
experience
in
the
united
states.
hence,
there's
somewhat,
it's
not
clear
as
to
how
much
they
interpret
from
the
holy
qur'an,
how
much
they
interpret
from
the
bible
or
from
the
message
to
black
man.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
i
am
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
right.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
your
honor,
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
heard
anybody
suggest
that
black
muslim
theology
came
from
any
just
or
unjust
wars.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
that
war
means
a
theocratic
war
which
is
the
same
as
the
kind
of
war
that
sicurella
war
or
the
jehovah's
witness.
they
believe
in
the
war
of
armageddon
which
is
a
war
against
right
versus
wrong.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
there
may
be,
but
i
doubt
that
they
would
be
what
the
muslims
speak
of
as
the
nation
of
islam.
what
they
mean
by
that
is
not
a
territorial
area,
but
it
means
the
religious
group.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
the
record
would
show
that
because
in
the
early
part
of
the
testimony,
they
put
on
in
an
assistant
minister
of
the
temple,
and
that
was
sam
x.
saxon,
and
his
testimony
begins
at
page
22
or
23
of
--
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
of
the
appendix,
page
30
of
the
appendix.
and
he
speaks
of
what
their
beliefs
are,
and
down
in
--
now
he's
asked
the
question.
“what
book
do
you
follow?
what
books
for
publication
--“
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
page
40a.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
a
of
the
appendix.
“what
books
do
you
follow?
what
books
for
publication
if
any
you
use
as
a
basis
for
the
belief
of
the
nation
of
islam
or
the
objections
of
muhammad
ali
as
expressed
in
his
papers
with
file
with
the
draft
board,
in
which
you
have
expressed
to
judge
grauman
here.”
answer;
“i
think
you
could
find
them
in
the
holy
qur'an
and
this
book
that
you
got
here,
“message
to
black
man”
written
by
the
honorable
elijah
muhammad.”
now
he
then
points
to
these
two
books.
now,
some
of
the
quotations
from
the
book
“message
to
black
man”
are
here,
made
supposed
to
be
relevant
as
to
what
the
doctrines
are
and
this
is
where
the
government
gets
its
position
that
if
you
read
that
book,
the
book
is
saying
that
it
supports
tomorrow
a
defensive
war
on
behalf
of
muslims.
well,
this
is
the
same
as
saying
that
they
support
the
war
against
the
church
which
was
in
the
same
thing
the
sicurella
that
there
is
no
place
in
this
record
where
either
the
registrant
or
the
petitioner,
or
any
of
his
co-religionists
say
this.
and
remember,
the
hearing
officer
judge
grauman
had
six
inches
worth
of
an
fbi
report.
they
had
done
an
extensive
investigation
of
the
background
and
acquaintances
of
the
registrant.
then
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
we
make
a
distinction.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
it
is
totally
confined.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
that
is
--
they've
taken
some
part
of
what
they
call
orthodox
islam.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
and
here,
they
fashion
it
to
the
black
man's
experience
in
the
united
states.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
the
defense
--
where
they
use
the
word
defense,
they
mean
the
defense
of
islam.
they
mean
the
defense
of
the
religion
not
persons.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
well
not
certainly
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
that's
personal
and
self
defense,
but
this
is
a
young
group
of
men
in
the
temple
called
the
“fruit
of
islam”
who
take
physical
exercise.
some
of
which
is
marching,
some
of
which
they
call
drilling
which
is
marching.
some
of
which
is
judo
and
it's
those
words
which
would
juxtapose,
the
justice
department
have
chosen
a
drill
and
judo,
and
key
words
like
military
orders
which
would
give
you
the
impression
that
this
is
a
semi-military
organization,
it
is
not.
this
is
a
small
group
of
men
who
are
young
men,
who
are
given
this
kind
of
training.
and
they
intended
that
it'll
be
used
only
in
defense
of
themselves
or
against
in
defense
of
their
leaders,
so
that
to
suggest
here
that
they
would
use
this
for
a
use
for
weapons
against
other
persons,
they
don't
say
this.
they
just
say
that
they're
totally
--
their
total
defense
are
with
their
hands
when
attacked.
this
is
their
position.
now,
we
go
farther.
we
say
that
if
you
read
this
advice
letter
in
which
the
department
of
justice
disparages
the
religion,
and
then
it
adds
further
down
at
page
125a,
then
they
go
on
after
they
say
that
his
religions
is
racious
and
political.
then
they
go
on
and
the
registrant
--
this
device
that
are
to
the
appeal
board
says
“the
main
thrust
of
the
letter
that
he
had
written
in
which
he
claims
other,
other
classifications.”
then
they
say
that
there's
something
wrong
with
this
that
he
has
shifted
his
position,
but
remember
he
was
1-y
all
the
way
up
to
february
1966,
so
that
he
had
no
occasion
to
apply
for
a
lower
qualification
because
conscientious
objector
is
higher.
so
that
the
hearing
officer,
when
they
wrote
to
the
appeal
board,
they
should
have
told
the
appeal
board
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
him
to
inform
the
draft
board
that
he
was
then
a
conscientious
objective
because
this
was
a
higher
classification.
but
notwithstanding
that,
they
go
on
and
say
“the
registrant
has
not
shown
manifest
over
at
manifestations
sufficient
to
establish
his
subjective
belief
whereas
here,
his
conscientious
objector
claim
was
not
asserted
until
military
service
became
eminent.”
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
he
had
a
lack
of
sincerity.
now,
not
only
did
this
mislead
the
appeal
board
we
say,
but
this
even
misled
the
fifth
circuit,
because
in
the
last
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
on
page
249,
footnote
9,
the
fifth
circuit
on
its
opinion
says,
“the
kentucky
appeal
board
thereafter
continued
the
1-a
classification
of
clay.
that
there
was
also
a
basis
of
fact
for
the
numerous
local
boards,
state
appeal
boards
and
presidential
appeal
boards
classification
of
clay,
thereby
including
an
adverse
determination
of
the
question
of
clay's
basic
sincerity.”
so
that
this
language,
we
say
of
his
sincerity
through
off
not
only
the
appeal
board,
but
through
off
the
fifth
circuit.
we're
asking
the
court
to
take
into
account
that
sicurella
also
said
that
where
two
erroneous
positions
or
one
erroneous
position
was
given
to
an
appeal
board
or
local
draft
board
that
this
requires
a
reversal
of
a
man's
conviction
because
the
court
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
one
--
which
one
the
draft
board
accepted
because
here,
the
record
does
not
indicate
which
one
of
the
grounds
that
the
appeal
board
rested
upon.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
may
i
answer
that
question?
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
if
you
take
the
first
sentence,
there's
two
sentences
there
and
now
we're
reading
in
the
back
of
muhammad
speaks
newspaper.
these
ten
points
appear
on
the
back
of
muhammad
speaks
newspaper,
and
the
solicitor
general
spoke
of
the
carson
case.
in
that
case,
the
same
words,
“we
believe
that
we
who
declared
ourselves
to
be
righteous
muslims
should
not
participate
in
wars
which
take
the
lives
of
humans.”
then
they
go
out
“we
do
not
believe
this
nation
should
force
us
to
take
part
in
such
wars.
it
forces
to
take
part
in
such
wars
if
we
have
nothing
to
gain
from
it,
unless
america
agrees
to
give
us
the
necessary
territory
wherein
we
have,
may
have
something
to
fight
for.”
now,
this
language
is
ambiguous,
but
it
doesn't
suggest
that
they
will
fight
with
weapons
in
war
and
in
the
negre
case,
i
mean
in
the
carson
case,
i
would
like
to
read
you
something
that
the
department
of
justice
said,
“that
at
best,
carson's
objections,
the
war
is
based
on
political,
social
and
economic
consideration
and
not
religious.”
so
that
they
are
taking
a
position,
in
the
carson
case,
it
was
not
religious,
and
they're
taking
position
here.
i
sense
a
prejudice
against
the
so
called
black
muslims
that
appears
in
the
government's
briefs
and
which
it
appears
against
this
defendant
who
was
the
heavy
weight
champion
of
the
world,
and
whom
who
had
announced
that
he
was
a
muslim.
and
it
is
that
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
contrived
language
and
to
--
and
the
hearing
--
the
advice
letter.
now
we
don't
say
that
the
advice
letter,
one
that's
put
to
the
nine
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
this
advice
letter
went
to
layman
who
made
up
the
appeal
board
of
kentucky.
they
had
to
read
this
letter
and
if
you
all
can't
get
this
interpretation,
how
did
this
appeal
board?
we
say
in
sicurella
that
if
there
are
two
erroneous
grounds
in
here,
they
admit
to
sincerity.
in
the
advice
letter,
they
did
not
admit
to
sincerity
and
in
this
advice
letter,
the
language
is
set,
they
didn't
even
admit
that
he
was
even
more
religious.
so
we're
saying
to
your
honor,
that
you
have
to
reverse
on
the
grounds
of
sicurella
because
this
is
the
--
the
issues
this
case
and
not
as
how
the
justice
department
finds
it.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
that
one
sentence
you
mean?
no
sir.
it
would've
been
unreasonable
for
them
to
have
taken
that
one
sentence
to
reach
a
conclusion
that
the
muslims
would
fight
only
selective
wars.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
important
case
because
it
poises
the
--
a
famous
athlete,
the
heavyweight
or
ex-heavyweight
champion
of
the
world
against
the
united
states
selective
service
system,
which
treated
him
we
say,
unfairly.
may
it
be
recalled
that
in
february
1964,
the
so
called
louisville
lip,
so
called
because
of
his
loquaciousness
to
say
the
least,
he
just
won
the
championship
of
mid
great
public
acclaim.
he
had
just
announced
that
time
that
he
was
a
so
called
black
muslim.
at
that
time,
they
were
considered
to
be
terrorists
or
subversives
because
the
justice
department
then
was
wiretapping
his
leader,
the
honorable
elijah
mohammed.
well,
soon
after
he
won
the
championship
in
march
of
1964,
it
was
announced
by
the
officials
by
the
selective
service
system
that
he
had
been
given
two
qualifications
test,
and
he
had
failed
both
and
had
been
given
the
classification
of
1-y.
almost
two
years
went
by
and
after
many
reams
of
newspaper
copy,
he
was
then
sent
on
february
3,
1966
a
statement
of
his
acceptability,
this
because
the
selective
service
system
had
lowered
his
qualifications
for
admissions
into
the
armed
forces.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
1-y
means
that
he
is
not
then,
or
that
he'd
only
been
taken
in
case
of
war
or
national
emergency.
on
february
14,
1966,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
local
draft
board,
alleging
facts
which
he
claims
entitled
him
under
the
law
to
several
lower
classifications,
including
that
of
the
conscientious
objector.
without
more,
on
the
february
17,
1966,
his
local
board
reclassified
him.
then
the
next
day,
the
local
board
sent
him
the
usual
form
150,
which
is
the
application
for
a
conscientious
objector.
then
on
the
february
28,
he
sent
the
application
back,
which
showing
on
the
face
of
this
application
what
we
consider
to
be
a
prima
facie
entitlement
to
the
status
of
conscientious
objector.
in
his
handwriting,
he
wrote,
“muslim
means
peace,
total
submission
to
the
will
of
allah,
do
not
take
the
lives
of
anyone,
nor
war
when
ordered
--
when
not
ordered
by
allah”
and
in
parenthesis
he
has
the
word
(god,
keep
our
prayers
and
pay
poor
rates),
that's
quotation
from
his
form
150.
and
the
form
50
maybe
found
in
page
17a
of
the
appendix
--
i'm
sorry,
on
page
12
a
of
the
appendix.
he
then
appeared
before
his
draft
board
on
march
17,
1966
and
the
notes
of
the
clerk
or
the
minutes
of
that
meeting
appear
on
page
17a
of
the
appendix
and
they
will
get
them
important,
because
the
notes
of
the
minutes
of
that
meeting
are
later
quoted
by
the
government
as
being
pertinent
in
this
case.
then
the
appeal
process
starts.
as
you
remember
in
those
days,
you
made
an
--
you
make
an
application
to
the
appeal
board,
and
the
appeal
board
refers
the
matter
to
the
united
states
justice
department,
and
the
united
states
justice
department
at
that
time
appointed
under
the
statute,
a
hearing
officer
who
was
to
have
a
hearing
on
good
faith
and
character
of
the
registrant.
in
this
case,
it
is
important
that
the
hearing
officer
was
an
ex-chief,
an
ex-judge,
a
retired
judge
from
the
system
of
kentucky,
a
man
in
his
60's
and
who
had
been
on
the
bench
many
number
of
years.
and
that
this
judge
had
this
hearing,
his
name
was
judge
grauman.
now,
judge
grauman
heard
several
witnesses.
he
also
had
in
front
of
him,
the
record
shows
that
an
fbi
report
of
about
six
inches.
he
also
was
given
at
the
hearing
two
books,
one
of
which
was
called
the
“message
to
the
black
man”
written
by
the
honorable
elijah
mohammed,
and
another
book
entitled
“the
holy
qur'an”
by
muhammad
ali,
not
our
muhammad
ali,
another
one.
and
there
was
also
introduced
a
copy
of
a
newspaper
that
put
out
by
his
sect,
the
muslims
called
it
the
“muhammad
speaks.”
now,
judge
grauman,
he
had
the
first
opportunity
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
he
could
determine
whether
how
much
credence
to
put
in
the
testimony
of
the
people
in
front
of
him
and
judge
grauman
wrote
his
report,
and
his
report
appears
on
page
17a.
in
some
of
his
notations
in
what
we
call
the
advice
letter
which
is
written
by
the
attorney
general
--
written
by
the
selective
service
system,
i
mean,
the
justice
department
and
this
is
where
we
consider
the
crux
of
this
case
is
in
the
so
called
advice
letter.
now,
the
hearing
officer
wrote
his
report
and
he
concluded
at
page
117a
in
the
appendix
that
the
registrant
is
sincere
in
his
objections
on
religious
ground,
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form
and
he
recommended
that
the
conscientious
objector
claim
of
the
registrant
be
sustained,
notwithstanding.
the
justice
--
at
that
time,
the
justice
department
had
a
conscientious
objector
section
and
all
letters
are
written
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
t.
oscar
smith
who
was
in
charge
of
the
section
and
this
letter
was
written
back
signed
by
t.
oscar
smith.
and
then
after
having
said
that
the
hearing
officer
had
found
the
registrant
sincere,
at
page
128,
he
then
quotes
from
“muhammad
speaks”
seven
lines
from
the
newspaper
“muhammad
speaks.”
then
the
next
paragraph
he
gives,
that
is
the
writer
of
the
letter
gives
his
opinion
of
what
“muhammad
speaks”
says
and
what
“message
of
black
man”
says,
it's
in
the
bottom
of
page
120
and
beginning
121,
then
he
gives
his
opinion.
it
seems
clear
on
reading
these
two
documents
that
the
teachings
of
the
nation
of
islam
precludes
fighting
for
the
united
states,
not
because
of
objections
to
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
but
rather
because
a
political
and
and
racial
objections
to
policies
the
united
states
as
interpreted
by
elijah
muhammad.
then
he
goes
on
and
he
reads
a
part
of
a
hypothetical
question
which
muhammad
ali,
the
registrant
had
answered
at
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
officer.
then
he
quotes
part
of
registrant's
testimony,
and
then
he
comes
to
this
conclusion.
“it
is
therefore
our
conclusion
that
the
registrant
claimed
objections
to
participation
of
war
insofar
as
they
are
based
upon
the
teachings
of
the
nation
of
islam
rest
on
grounds
which
are
primarily
political
and
racial.”
now
we
say
that
when
these
men
who
are
on
the
appeal
board,
who
had
to
read
this
advice
letter,
with
this
language,
they
interpret
it
like
we
interpret
it
that
this
is
as
same
as
saying
that
the
--
his
objection
to
the
war
were
based
on
political
or
racial
grounds
and
not
on
his
religion
training
and
belief.
now,
we
understand
that
now
the
government
in
its
brief,
page
30
--
page
27
in
government's
brief,
now
say
that
that
language
was
not
intended
to
say
they
were
not
religious.
now,
the
government
says
that
this
language
was
or
that
muhammad
ali
was
one
who
had
his
belief
rooted
in
religious
training
and
belief.
but
now
they
say
that
political
and
racial
and
if
you
interpret
it,
they
say
that
the
record
infers
the
inference
that
petitioner
would
fight
“tomorrow”
in
a
defensive
war
on
behalf
of
muslims.
this
reminds
us
of
the
case
of
sicurella
where
the
hypothetical
questions
was
put
to
jehovah's
witness,
what
they
would
they
do
if
they
did
so
and
so,
or
if
so
and
so
and
so.
now,
they
have
taken
some
language,
juxtapose
against
other
language,
and
they
come
to
this
conclusion,
but
nowhere
in
the
record
as
the
registrant
ever
said
that
he
would
fight
with
weapons
against
anybody.
now
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes,
sir.
the
holy
war
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
they
adopt
the
qur'an,
especially
the
one
that's
edited
by
muhammad
--
you
see,
there's
two
names;
maulana
muhammad
ali,
that's
their
official
version.
and
it
--
they
use
it
and
they
couple
it
with
the
black
man's
experience
in
the
united
states.
hence,
there's
somewhat,
it's
not
clear
as
to
how
much
they
interpret
from
the
holy
qur'an,
how
much
they
interpret
from
the
bible
or
from
the
message
to
black
man.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
i
am
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
right.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
your
honor,
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
heard
anybody
suggest
that
black
muslim
theology
came
from
any
just
or
unjust
wars.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
that
war
means
a
theocratic
war
which
is
the
same
as
the
kind
of
war
that
sicurella
war
or
the
jehovah's
witness.
they
believe
in
the
war
of
armageddon
which
is
a
war
against
right
versus
wrong.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
there
may
be,
but
i
doubt
that
they
would
be
what
the
muslims
speak
of
as
the
nation
of
islam.
what
they
mean
by
that
is
not
a
territorial
area,
but
it
means
the
religious
group.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
the
record
would
show
that
because
in
the
early
part
of
the
testimony,
they
put
on
in
an
assistant
minister
of
the
temple,
and
that
was
sam
x.
saxon,
and
his
testimony
begins
at
page
22
or
23
of
--
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
of
the
appendix,
page
30
of
the
appendix.
and
he
speaks
of
what
their
beliefs
are,
and
down
in
--
now
he's
asked
the
question.
“what
book
do
you
follow?
what
books
for
publication
--“
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
page
40a.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
a
of
the
appendix.
“what
books
do
you
follow?
what
books
for
publication
if
any
you
use
as
a
basis
for
the
belief
of
the
nation
of
islam
or
the
objections
of
muhammad
ali
as
expressed
in
his
papers
with
file
with
the
draft
board,
in
which
you
have
expressed
to
judge
grauman
here.”
answer;
“i
think
you
could
find
them
in
the
holy
qur'an
and
this
book
that
you
got
here,
“message
to
black
man”
written
by
the
honorable
elijah
muhammad.”
now
he
then
points
to
these
two
books.
now,
some
of
the
quotations
from
the
book
“message
to
black
man”
are
here,
made
supposed
to
be
relevant
as
to
what
the
doctrines
are
and
this
is
where
the
government
gets
its
position
that
if
you
read
that
book,
the
book
is
saying
that
it
supports
tomorrow
a
defensive
war
on
behalf
of
muslims.
well,
this
is
the
same
as
saying
that
they
support
the
war
against
the
church
which
was
in
the
same
thing
the
sicurella
that
there
is
no
place
in
this
record
where
either
the
registrant
or
the
petitioner,
or
any
of
his
co-religionists
say
this.
and
remember,
the
hearing
officer
judge
grauman
had
six
inches
worth
of
an
fbi
report.
they
had
done
an
extensive
investigation
of
the
background
and
acquaintances
of
the
registrant.
then
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
we
make
a
distinction.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
it
is
totally
confined.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
that
is
--
they've
taken
some
part
of
what
they
call
orthodox
islam.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
and
here,
they
fashion
it
to
the
black
man's
experience
in
the
united
states.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
the
defense
--
where
they
use
the
word
defense,
they
mean
the
defense
of
islam.
they
mean
the
defense
of
the
religion
not
persons.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
well
not
certainly
--
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
that's
personal
and
self
defense,
but
this
is
a
young
group
of
men
in
the
temple
called
the
“fruit
of
islam”
who
take
physical
exercise.
some
of
which
is
marching,
some
of
which
they
call
drilling
which
is
marching.
some
of
which
is
judo
and
it's
those
words
which
would
juxtapose,
the
justice
department
have
chosen
a
drill
and
judo,
and
key
words
like
military
orders
which
would
give
you
the
impression
that
this
is
a
semi-military
organization,
it
is
not.
this
is
a
small
group
of
men
who
are
young
men,
who
are
given
this
kind
of
training.
and
they
intended
that
it'll
be
used
only
in
defense
of
themselves
or
against
in
defense
of
their
leaders,
so
that
to
suggest
here
that
they
would
use
this
for
a
use
for
weapons
against
other
persons,
they
don't
say
this.
they
just
say
that
they're
totally
--
their
total
defense
are
with
their
hands
when
attacked.
this
is
their
position.
now,
we
go
farther.
we
say
that
if
you
read
this
advice
letter
in
which
the
department
of
justice
disparages
the
religion,
and
then
it
adds
further
down
at
page
125a,
then
they
go
on
after
they
say
that
his
religions
is
racious
and
political.
then
they
go
on
and
the
registrant
--
this
device
that
are
to
the
appeal
board
says
“the
main
thrust
of
the
letter
that
he
had
written
in
which
he
claims
other,
other
classifications.”
then
they
say
that
there's
something
wrong
with
this
that
he
has
shifted
his
position,
but
remember
he
was
1-y
all
the
way
up
to
february
1966,
so
that
he
had
no
occasion
to
apply
for
a
lower
qualification
because
conscientious
objector
is
higher.
so
that
the
hearing
officer,
when
they
wrote
to
the
appeal
board,
they
should
have
told
the
appeal
board
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
him
to
inform
the
draft
board
that
he
was
then
a
conscientious
objective
because
this
was
a
higher
classification.
but
notwithstanding
that,
they
go
on
and
say
“the
registrant
has
not
shown
manifest
over
at
manifestations
sufficient
to
establish
his
subjective
belief
whereas
here,
his
conscientious
objector
claim
was
not
asserted
until
military
service
became
eminent.”
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
he
had
a
lack
of
sincerity.
now,
not
only
did
this
mislead
the
appeal
board
we
say,
but
this
even
misled
the
fifth
circuit,
because
in
the
last
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
on
page
249,
footnote
9,
the
fifth
circuit
on
its
opinion
says,
“the
kentucky
appeal
board
thereafter
continued
the
1-a
classification
of
clay.
that
there
was
also
a
basis
of
fact
for
the
numerous
local
boards,
state
appeal
boards
and
presidential
appeal
boards
classification
of
clay,
thereby
including
an
adverse
determination
of
the
question
of
clay's
basic
sincerity.”
so
that
this
language,
we
say
of
his
sincerity
through
off
not
only
the
appeal
board,
but
through
off
the
fifth
circuit.
we're
asking
the
court
to
take
into
account
that
sicurella
also
said
that
where
two
erroneous
positions
or
one
erroneous
position
was
given
to
an
appeal
board
or
local
draft
board
that
this
requires
a
reversal
of
a
man's
conviction
because
the
court
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
one
--
which
one
the
draft
board
accepted
because
here,
the
record
does
not
indicate
which
one
of
the
grounds
that
the
appeal
board
rested
upon.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
may
i
answer
that
question?
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
no
sir.
if
you
take
the
first
sentence,
there's
two
sentences
there
and
now
we're
reading
in
the
back
of
muhammad
speaks
newspaper.
these
ten
points
appear
on
the
back
of
muhammad
speaks
newspaper,
and
the
solicitor
general
spoke
of
the
carson
case.
in
that
case,
the
same
words,
“we
believe
that
we
who
declared
ourselves
to
be
righteous
muslims
should
not
participate
in
wars
which
take
the
lives
of
humans.”
then
they
go
out
“we
do
not
believe
this
nation
should
force
us
to
take
part
in
such
wars.
it
forces
to
take
part
in
such
wars
if
we
have
nothing
to
gain
from
it,
unless
america
agrees
to
give
us
the
necessary
territory
wherein
we
have,
may
have
something
to
fight
for.”
now,
this
language
is
ambiguous,
but
it
doesn't
suggest
that
they
will
fight
with
weapons
in
war
and
in
the
negre
case,
i
mean
in
the
carson
case,
i
would
like
to
read
you
something
that
the
department
of
justice
said,
“that
at
best,
carson's
objections,
the
war
is
based
on
political,
social
and
economic
consideration
and
not
religious.”
so
that
they
are
taking
a
position,
in
the
carson
case,
it
was
not
religious,
and
they're
taking
position
here.
i
sense
a
prejudice
against
the
so
called
black
muslims
that
appears
in
the
government's
briefs
and
which
it
appears
against
this
defendant
who
was
the
heavy
weight
champion
of
the
world,
and
whom
who
had
announced
that
he
was
a
muslim.
and
it
is
that
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
this
contrived
language
and
to
--
and
the
hearing
--
the
advice
letter.
now
we
don't
say
that
the
advice
letter,
one
that's
put
to
the
nine
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
this
advice
letter
went
to
layman
who
made
up
the
appeal
board
of
kentucky.
they
had
to
read
this
letter
and
if
you
all
can't
get
this
interpretation,
how
did
this
appeal
board?
we
say
in
sicurella
that
if
there
are
two
erroneous
grounds
in
here,
they
admit
to
sincerity.
in
the
advice
letter,
they
did
not
admit
to
sincerity
and
in
this
advice
letter,
the
language
is
set,
they
didn't
even
admit
that
he
was
even
more
religious.
so
we're
saying
to
your
honor,
that
you
have
to
reverse
on
the
grounds
of
sicurella
because
this
is
the
--
the
issues
this
case
and
not
as
how
the
justice
department
finds
it.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
that
one
sentence
you
mean?
no
sir.
it
would've
been
unreasonable
for
them
to
have
taken
that
one
sentence
to
reach
a
conclusion
that
the
muslims
would
fight
only
selective
wars.
mr.
chauncey
eskridge
yes
sir.
