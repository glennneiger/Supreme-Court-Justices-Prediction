mr.
long,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
in
effect
that
if
the
court,
that
this
injunction
is
much
the
same
as
one
which
by
its
terms
was
given
a
three-year
life
that
is
that
this
activity
was
enjoined
for
a
period
of
three
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
would
then
be
final
enough
for
review
even
though
there
might
be
another
stage
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
really
arguing
for
a
theory
of
degrees
of
finality
and
this
is
final
enough
for
review
because
it
has
restrained
the
first
amendment
rights
for
three
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn’t
time

a
libel
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
wasn’t
a
prior
restraint
case
in
the

of
near
against
minnesota?
chief

warren
e.
burger
has
there
been
any
state
prior
restraint
case
since
near
against
minnesota
that
represented
the
classic
features
of
near
against
minnesota?
chief

warren
e.

mr.
mcnamara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
remarks
were
made
contemporaneously,
were
they
not
at
the
time
of
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
that
time
do
you
suppose
the
people
present
anticipated
that
this
temporary
restraints
would
be
in
effect
for
three
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
could
have
brought
that
on
for
a
hearing
on
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
after
the
entry
of
the
order
was
the
appeal
noted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
there

18,000
community
where

that
18,000
figure
represents
the
community
in
which
his
residence
was
located,
is
that
right?
chief

warren
e.
burger
and
suppose
there
was
a
small
weekly

is
often
in
a
community
of
that
size,
and
each
them,
the
radio
station
and
the
newspaper
had
said
in
their
way
everything
that
was
said
here.
would
that
be
subject
to
any
injunction?
chief

they?

warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
near
case,
mr.
near
did
not

all
mr.

periodically
get

they
looked
somewhat
like
a
newspaper
but
they
were
not
regular
publications.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
it
becomes
a
nuisance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
that
be
relevant
unless
you
had
an

man’s
house?
that’s
what
was
involved
in
rowland.
chief

warren
e.

here
just

prohibited
any
activity
by

delivering
pamphlets
or
written

you
might
have
a
rowland

of
