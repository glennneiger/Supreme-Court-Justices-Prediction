justice

r.
white
something
in
between?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
large
is
westchester?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
you’re
entitled
to
picket
persons’
residential
area
in
any
situation,
you
can
picket
his
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
situation
where
the
first

would
protect
your
picketing
his
business,
could
you
also
picket
his
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i’ll
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
in
any
situation
where
you
could
distribute
handbills
in
front
of
his
place
of
business,
you
could
distribute
handbills
in
front
of
his
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
there
is
no
conduct
except
there’s
standing
in
front
of
his
home
distributing
a
handbill.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
person
distributing
handbill.
justice

but
there
is
evidence
that
they
distributed
to
his

justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice

and
you

up
at
lake
geneva,
wisconsin?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
the
colorado

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
he
lived
next
door
to
his
place
of
business,
do
you
think
that
the
injunction
would
have
prevented
you
from
distributing
leaflets
down
the
whole

justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the

neighbors?
justice

white
so,
you
would
say
that

been
enjoined
