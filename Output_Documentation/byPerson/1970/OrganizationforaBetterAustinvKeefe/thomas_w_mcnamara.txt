mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
that
is
whether
this
matter
is
right
for
decision.
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
record
whether
the
court
below
had
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
is
of
10
days
duration
and
would
expire
automatically
by
its
terms
or
whether
it
had
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
which
remains
in
force
and
effect
until
dissolved
or
until
there’s
been
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
even
though
i
think
this
point
may
not
be
perfectly
clear
from
the
record,
the
parties
have
treated
this
as
a
preliminary
injunction
and
have
assumed
that
the
injunction
and
prohibition
is
still
in
effect.
the
parties
further,
however,
have
assumed
that
there
would
be
additional
evidence
presented
when
there
was
a
full-hearing
on
the
merits
of
this
matter
and
i
would
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
page
66
of
the
appendix
for
certain
remarks
on
that
regard.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
at
the
time
the
trial
court
indicated
he
would
deny
the
one
request
for
an
injunction
and
grant
the
others.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i’m
sure
they
did
not,
your
honor.
normally,
there
would
a
hearing
in
the
matter
of
weeks
or
months
after
a
temporary
injunction.
the
purpose
of
this
of
course
is
to
keep
the
matter
in
status
quo
until
there
can
be
a
full
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
complaint
which
normally
would
occur
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
once
a
notice
of
appeal
has
--
once
the
appeal
was
taken
in
the
jurisdiction
that
was
transferred
from
the
trial
courts,
so
it’s
in
effect
then
the
appeals
that
have
delayed
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
it
was
within
30
days,
appeal
of
this
character
you
have
to
file
your
notice
for
appeal
within
30
days.
the
illinois
appellate
court
has
had
a
tremendous
backlog
of
cases
and
it’s
not
unusual
to
have
16
to
18
months
between
the
time
of
appeal
and
the
time
of
disposition.
so,
that
accounts,
i
think
for
a
great
deal
of
the
delay
here.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
by
statute,
there
are
two
different
restraining
orders
of
a
preliminary
nature.
one
is
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
–-
and
the
notice
requirements
are
different
which
would
expire
in
10
days
automatically.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
i
think,
a
preliminary
injunction
is
what
i
would
more
normally
call
it
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
it
was
a
loose
labeling
there,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
parties
have
understood
it
to
be
and
treated
it
as
is
a
preliminary
injunction
which
has
been
in
effect
until
dissolved.
i
think
there
are
several
facts
which
have
to
be
highlighted
here
in
considering
the
propriety
of
what
the
court
did
below.
first,
mr.
keefe’s
real
estate
business
and
activities
were
solely
confined
to
the
west
side
of
chicago.
he
did
no
business
in
westchester.
he
did
not
use
his
personal
residence
in
any
way
in
connection
with
his
business.
he
did
not
solicit
his
neighbors
for
listings.
his
only
relationship
with
these
people
in
his
immediate
community
was
that
typical
neighbor
relationship,
the
social
relationship,
the
relationships
we
all
have
with
the
people
we
reside
nearby.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no,
indeed
your
honor.
that
is
in
part
the
case
here.
there
is
a
local
newspaper,
the
westchester
news
which
spread
it
and
as
part
of
the
record
here
a
telegram
about
mr.
keefe
from
the
organization
for
better
austin.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
who
was
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no.
your
honor,
there
has
been
never
been
any
claim
made
or
attempt
to
enjoin,
prohibit
or
otherwise
interfere
in
anyway
with
the
newspaper
publication.
we
recognize,
i
believe
a
different
standard
there.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no,
no,
a
different
standard
between
publications
your
honor
by
newspaper
and
by
the
distributions
of
the
nature
that
occurred
here
of
handbills.
now,
there’s
an
invasion
of
privacy
in
a
sense,
in
a
newspaper
publication
that's
derogatory.
obviously,
your
neighbors
are
exposed
to
facts
you
would
prefer
that
they
not
see.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
here,
your
honor,
i
think,
you
have
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
calculated
invasion
of
privacy
for
the
purpose
of
course
in
action
which
i
do
not
think
was
the
near
case.
here,
they
said,
we’re
going
to
get
keefe
where
he’s
most
vulnerable.
we’re
going
to
go
where
we
can
have
some
influence
on
his
neighbors
and
on
his
family
and
get
him
to
bend
to
our
will.
so,
i
think
you
had
a
--
the
medium
was
the
message
really
was
the
problem
here.
you
had
a
use
of
handbills
to
in
effect
bludgeon
keefe
in
to
conduct
with
just
the
incidental
point
of
communicating
to
his
neighbors.
the
record
shows
that
they
first
went
out
to
the
house
with
the
handbills
in
hand
and
met
with
mrs.
keefe,
his
wife
and
said,
“unless
mr.
keefe
will
meet
with
us,
we’re
going
out
and
distribute
these
to
your
neighbors.”
and
that
point
in
time,
a
meeting
took
place.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
under
no
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
have
not
--
i
think,
first,
there
are
two
matters
of
distinction
there.
i
think
our
policy
of
a
free
press
has
a
greater
and
more
overriding
importance
than
the
policy
of
permitting
a
protester’s
access
to
a
residential
neighborhood.
i
think
there’s
no
element
of
personal
confrontation
in
newspaper
distribution.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
the
element
of
personal
confrontation
here.
although,
i
do
think
when
we
consider
privacy
and
the
right
of
privacy,
it’s
hard
to
describe
for
all
time
what
is
unreasonably
intrusive
conduct.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
for
instance
your
honor,
let’s
say,
they
started
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
in
fact,
yeah,
let
me
give
you
an
example
if
i
might,
your
honor.
let’s
assume
the
oba
began
to
phone
on
a
daily
basis,
everyone
on
mr.
keefe’s
block
and
said,
when
mr.
keefe
stops
bothering
us,
we’ll
stop
bothering
you.
now,
i
think
a
telephone
call
is
certainly
a
protected
first
amendment
activity,
the
right
to
communicate
by
telephone.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
this
is
the
point
i’m
making
your
honor
but
it
can
lose
--
i
think
the
first
amendment
protection
of
that
type
of
harassment
and
conduct
is
so
minimal
that
it
should
be
weighed
at
the
balance
against
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
parties
concerned
and
not
be
permitted.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
this
prevented
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
as
i
read
it
mr.
justice
white,
it
prevented
the
physical
distribution
by
members
of
the
oba
in
the
community
of
westchester.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
passing
out
i
believe
is
the
word
to
the
injunction
order.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
don’t
know
that
any
of
them
have
passed
out
such
leaflets,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
the
language
was
perhaps
unduly
broad
there
because
obviously,
it
was
mr.
keefe’s
activities
at
which
this
injunction
order
was
directed
and
i’m
sure
that
had
matter
been
called
to
the
trial
court’s
attention
by
either
of
the
parties
that
the
order
would’ve
been
so
limited.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
under
illinois
law,
it
is
held
that
a
specific
to
orders
of
this
character,
if
not
made
to
the
trial
court
could
not
later
be
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think,
interpret
it,
your
honor
as
the
parties
have
limited
and
prohibited
only
activities
directed
at
mr.
keefe.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
have
not
seen
anywhere
in
his
argument
and
briefs
that
he’s
filed
to
date
your
honor,
i
could
be
mistaken
any
reference
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
but,
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
would
not
show
this
up
as
a
model
of
draftsmanship
but
again,
the
parties
involved
here
assume
there
would
be
a
hearing
on
the
merits
within
a
space
of
weeks
or
months
and
a
final
order
entered
either
granting
or
denying
the
injunction.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no,
your
honor,
i
did
in
the
response
to
the
request
for
certiorari,
i
did
raise
the
point
that
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction
and
it
seemed
to
me
somewhat
unusual
that
at
this
stage
the
court
would
consider
a
right
for
determination.
i
would
like
to
comment,
if
i
could,
on
the
–
what
i
think
is
the
real
base
of
the
activity
in
westchester
here.
we
are
all
most
vulnerable,
i
think,
in
our
relationships
with
our
families
and
with
our
neighbors.
and
here
i
think
is
a
very
calculated
attempt
to
play
on
this
weakness
and
to
direct
activities
at
us
that
will
compel
us
to
take
some
action
not
because
we’re
persuaded
it’s
correct
but
simply
because
we
need
to
buy
peace.
we
don’t
want
to
cause
embarrassment
to
our
neighbors,
we
don’t
want
to
see
neighbor
turned
against
neighbor.
we
don’t
want
our
families
disrupted.
and
i
think
we’re
getting
now
at
the
areas
that
really
go
to
the
core
of
privacy.
if
privacy
means
anything
at
all,
it
should
grant
us
protection
in
the
area
of
our
homes,
in
the
area
of
our
relationships
with
our
neighbors
and
our
communal
relationships.
the
organization
for
better
austin
takes
the
position
that
it
has
an
absolute
and
unqualified
right
to
hand
bill
whenever
and
wherever
it
intends
for
whatever
purpose
it
cares
to
do
it.
it
seeks
to
treat
hand
billing
under
all
circumstances
as
the
equivalent
of
newspaper
distribution
and
i
think
looking
at
what
has
occurred
here,
that
that
would
be
sloganeering
to
say
that
it
is
always
entitled
to
that
same
protection.
i
think
there
is
hand
billing
in
hand
billing.
certainly,
in
many,
many
instances,
it
is
clearly
entitled
to
full
first
amendment
protection
but
i
think
the
conduct
of
the
organization
for
better
austin
here
is
more
akin
to
our
peaceful
picketing
cases,
in
which
we
have
said
certainly,
this
is
a
protected
first
amendment
activity.
it
is
communication
but
it
is
something
more
than
communication
and
being
something
more
than
speech
pure,
we
are
entitled
to
reasonably
regulate.
i
think
hughes
versus
the
superior
court
has
decided
some
20
years
by
this
court
is
a
good
example
of
such
circumstances.
in
the
hughes
case,
they
enjoined
peaceful
picketing
by
negroes
who
were
seeking
to
urge
a
store
at
which
they
shopped
to
hire
in
proportion
to
their
negro
trade.
the
court
there
held
that
such
activity
could
be
examined
to
see
what
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
was.
the
purpose
having
been
examined
and
found
to
be
improper,
the
court
said
it
was
subject
to
reasonable
regulation
by
the
state
of
california.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
temporary
order
restricts
only
their
physical
presence
in
the
community
of
westchester.
i
think
one
of
the
serious
issues
we
have
here
is
whether
in
contemporary
america
with
our
many
confrontations,
dissent,
protest,
that
whether
we
will
permit
the
residential
neighborhood
to
become
a
part
of
the
battlefield.
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
is
the
effective
place
to
fight
the
battle.
men
who
could
not
be
persuaded
by
reasoning,
men
who
could
not
be
deterred
by
economic
pressures
may
certainly
be
forced
by
pressure
placed
upon
their
family
life
and
their
communal
relations
to
take
acts
which
they
would
not
otherwise
be
willing
to
take.
i
think
we
should
consider
and
look
at
this
case
the
heavy
burden
upon
our
public
servants
that
who
guide
our
cities
in
the
urban
problems
that
they
have.
it
was
not
too
long
ago,
this
court
had
before
it
the
gregory
case
which
involved
a
march
in
the
vicinity
of
mayor
daley’s
neighborhood
and
i
think
thought
was
given
us
to
whether
this
type
of
activity
should
be
encouraged
or
permitted
which
is
so
disruptive
of
family
and
neighborhood
life.
i
think
the
activity
here
by
the
organization
for
better
austin,
in
so
far
as
it
was
directed
towards
the
community
at
which
mr.
keefe
resides
suffers
from
the
same
vice.
indeed,
i
would
say,
it
resembles
here
residential
picketing
which
in
every
reported
case,
it
has
been
concluded
that
residential
picketing
has
either
been
enjoined,
it
has
either
been
made
the
subject
of
a
criminal
sanction
or
administrative
cease
and
desist
order.
there
is
no
reported
case
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
and
i
refer
also
to
professor
kayman’s
article
on
residential
picketing
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
the
injunction
order,
there
had
been
no
residential
picketing
in
westchester,
mr.
justice.
the
injunction
order
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
in
his
neighborhood,
at
his
church
and
in
his
shopping
center
of
the
handbills.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
we
are
to
this
extent.
when
you
consider
what
residential
picketing
is,
it’s
not
typical
picketing.
you
are
not
trying
to
keep
people
from
passing
in
or
out
of
a
residence.
there’s
not
the
element
of
intimidation
at
least
in
the
reported
cases
but
you
have
one
or
a
group
of
people
standing
in
front
of
someone’s
home
with
some
form
of
message
usually
of
a
derogatory
nature.
now,
i
see
no
particular
difference
as
far
as
the
homeowner
is
concerned
between
having
someone
stand
in
from
of
his
home
with
a
derogatory
placard
that
can
only
be
seen
by
his
neighbors
for
the
most
part
and
going
door-to-door
with
that
same
message
and
distributing
to
them.
so,
i
think
the
conduct
of
the
organization
for
better
austin
here
is
very
analogous
to
what
our
residential
picketing
situations
are.
the
court
recently
in
the
rowland
case,
the
head
occasion
to
consider
in
a
different
context
of
course,
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
light
to
be
let
alone
which
must
be
balanced
with
the
right
of
others
to
communicate.
and
i
think
we
are
faced
again
with
a
similar
resolution
of
conflicting
rights
here.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
there
you
were
involved
with
the
mail
order
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
i
don’t
claim
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
a
analogy
to
the
rowland
case
but
i
do
think
the
opinion
expressed
there
that
there
must
be
a
balancing
in
certain
circumstances
between
the
right
to
communicate
on
the
one
hand
and
the
right
to
be
left
alone
on
the
other
has
applicability
to
this
case.
i
might
say
parenthetically,
the
state
of
illinois
last
december
15th
has
adopted
a
new
constitution
which
is
part
of
its
bill
of
rights
has
expressly
provided
for
the
right
of
privacy
along
with
the
--
as
part
of
the
search
and
seizure
provision
of
the
act.
in
summary,
i
would
say
because
we
accept
and
tolerate
this
part
of
our
society,
what
i
would
consider
incidental
invasions
of
our
privacy
for
a
greater
good
because
the
freedom
of
the
press,
because
of
circulation
of
ideas.
i
do
not
think
that
--
we
must
therefore
legitimize
direct,
intentional
invasions
of
privacy
made
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
conduct
which
can’t
--
cannot
otherwise
be
secured
where
the
purpose
of
communicating
is
obviously
secondary.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
that
is
whether
this
matter
is
right
for
decision.
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
record
whether
the
court
below
had
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
is
of
10
days
duration
and
would
expire
automatically
by
its
terms
or
whether
it
had
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
which
remains
in
force
and
effect
until
dissolved
or
until
there’s
been
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
even
though
i
think
this
point
may
not
be
perfectly
clear
from
the
record,
the
parties
have
treated
this
as
a
preliminary
injunction
and
have
assumed
that
the
injunction
and
prohibition
is
still
in
effect.
the
parties
further,
however,
have
assumed
that
there
would
be
additional
evidence
presented
when
there
was
a
full-hearing
on
the
merits
of
this
matter
and
i
would
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
page
66
of
the
appendix
for
certain
remarks
on
that
regard.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
at
the
time
the
trial
court
indicated
he
would
deny
the
one
request
for
an
injunction
and
grant
the
others.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i’m
sure
they
did
not,
your
honor.
normally,
there
would
a
hearing
in
the
matter
of
weeks
or
months
after
a
temporary
injunction.
the
purpose
of
this
of
course
is
to
keep
the
matter
in
status
quo
until
there
can
be
a
full
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
complaint
which
normally
would
occur
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
once
a
notice
of
appeal
has
--
once
the
appeal
was
taken
in
the
jurisdiction
that
was
transferred
from
the
trial
courts,
so
it’s
in
effect
then
the
appeals
that
have
delayed
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
it
was
within
30
days,
appeal
of
this
character
you
have
to
file
your
notice
for
appeal
within
30
days.
the
illinois
appellate
court
has
had
a
tremendous
backlog
of
cases
and
it’s
not
unusual
to
have
16
to
18
months
between
the
time
of
appeal
and
the
time
of
disposition.
so,
that
accounts,
i
think
for
a
great
deal
of
the
delay
here.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
by
statute,
there
are
two
different
restraining
orders
of
a
preliminary
nature.
one
is
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
–-
and
the
notice
requirements
are
different
which
would
expire
in
10
days
automatically.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
i
think,
a
preliminary
injunction
is
what
i
would
more
normally
call
it
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
it
was
a
loose
labeling
there,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
parties
have
understood
it
to
be
and
treated
it
as
is
a
preliminary
injunction
which
has
been
in
effect
until
dissolved.
i
think
there
are
several
facts
which
have
to
be
highlighted
here
in
considering
the
propriety
of
what
the
court
did
below.
first,
mr.
keefe’s
real
estate
business
and
activities
were
solely
confined
to
the
west
side
of
chicago.
he
did
no
business
in
westchester.
he
did
not
use
his
personal
residence
in
any
way
in
connection
with
his
business.
he
did
not
solicit
his
neighbors
for
listings.
his
only
relationship
with
these
people
in
his
immediate
community
was
that
typical
neighbor
relationship,
the
social
relationship,
the
relationships
we
all
have
with
the
people
we
reside
nearby.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no,
indeed
your
honor.
that
is
in
part
the
case
here.
there
is
a
local
newspaper,
the
westchester
news
which
spread
it
and
as
part
of
the
record
here
a
telegram
about
mr.
keefe
from
the
organization
for
better
austin.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
who
was
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no.
your
honor,
there
has
been
never
been
any
claim
made
or
attempt
to
enjoin,
prohibit
or
otherwise
interfere
in
anyway
with
the
newspaper
publication.
we
recognize,
i
believe
a
different
standard
there.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no,
no,
a
different
standard
between
publications
your
honor
by
newspaper
and
by
the
distributions
of
the
nature
that
occurred
here
of
handbills.
now,
there’s
an
invasion
of
privacy
in
a
sense,
in
a
newspaper
publication
that's
derogatory.
obviously,
your
neighbors
are
exposed
to
facts
you
would
prefer
that
they
not
see.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
here,
your
honor,
i
think,
you
have
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
calculated
invasion
of
privacy
for
the
purpose
of
course
in
action
which
i
do
not
think
was
the
near
case.
here,
they
said,
we’re
going
to
get
keefe
where
he’s
most
vulnerable.
we’re
going
to
go
where
we
can
have
some
influence
on
his
neighbors
and
on
his
family
and
get
him
to
bend
to
our
will.
so,
i
think
you
had
a
--
the
medium
was
the
message
really
was
the
problem
here.
you
had
a
use
of
handbills
to
in
effect
bludgeon
keefe
in
to
conduct
with
just
the
incidental
point
of
communicating
to
his
neighbors.
the
record
shows
that
they
first
went
out
to
the
house
with
the
handbills
in
hand
and
met
with
mrs.
keefe,
his
wife
and
said,
“unless
mr.
keefe
will
meet
with
us,
we’re
going
out
and
distribute
these
to
your
neighbors.”
and
that
point
in
time,
a
meeting
took
place.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
under
no
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
have
not
--
i
think,
first,
there
are
two
matters
of
distinction
there.
i
think
our
policy
of
a
free
press
has
a
greater
and
more
overriding
importance
than
the
policy
of
permitting
a
protester’s
access
to
a
residential
neighborhood.
i
think
there’s
no
element
of
personal
confrontation
in
newspaper
distribution.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
the
element
of
personal
confrontation
here.
although,
i
do
think
when
we
consider
privacy
and
the
right
of
privacy,
it’s
hard
to
describe
for
all
time
what
is
unreasonably
intrusive
conduct.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
for
instance
your
honor,
let’s
say,
they
started
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
in
fact,
yeah,
let
me
give
you
an
example
if
i
might,
your
honor.
let’s
assume
the
oba
began
to
phone
on
a
daily
basis,
everyone
on
mr.
keefe’s
block
and
said,
when
mr.
keefe
stops
bothering
us,
we’ll
stop
bothering
you.
now,
i
think
a
telephone
call
is
certainly
a
protected
first
amendment
activity,
the
right
to
communicate
by
telephone.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
well,
this
is
the
point
i’m
making
your
honor
but
it
can
lose
--
i
think
the
first
amendment
protection
of
that
type
of
harassment
and
conduct
is
so
minimal
that
it
should
be
weighed
at
the
balance
against
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
parties
concerned
and
not
be
permitted.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
this
prevented
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
as
i
read
it
mr.
justice
white,
it
prevented
the
physical
distribution
by
members
of
the
oba
in
the
community
of
westchester.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
passing
out
i
believe
is
the
word
to
the
injunction
order.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
don’t
know
that
any
of
them
have
passed
out
such
leaflets,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
the
language
was
perhaps
unduly
broad
there
because
obviously,
it
was
mr.
keefe’s
activities
at
which
this
injunction
order
was
directed
and
i’m
sure
that
had
matter
been
called
to
the
trial
court’s
attention
by
either
of
the
parties
that
the
order
would’ve
been
so
limited.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
under
illinois
law,
it
is
held
that
a
specific
to
orders
of
this
character,
if
not
made
to
the
trial
court
could
not
later
be
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think,
interpret
it,
your
honor
as
the
parties
have
limited
and
prohibited
only
activities
directed
at
mr.
keefe.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
have
not
seen
anywhere
in
his
argument
and
briefs
that
he’s
filed
to
date
your
honor,
i
could
be
mistaken
any
reference
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
but,
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
would
not
show
this
up
as
a
model
of
draftsmanship
but
again,
the
parties
involved
here
assume
there
would
be
a
hearing
on
the
merits
within
a
space
of
weeks
or
months
and
a
final
order
entered
either
granting
or
denying
the
injunction.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
no,
your
honor,
i
did
in
the
response
to
the
request
for
certiorari,
i
did
raise
the
point
that
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction
and
it
seemed
to
me
somewhat
unusual
that
at
this
stage
the
court
would
consider
a
right
for
determination.
i
would
like
to
comment,
if
i
could,
on
the
–
what
i
think
is
the
real
base
of
the
activity
in
westchester
here.
we
are
all
most
vulnerable,
i
think,
in
our
relationships
with
our
families
and
with
our
neighbors.
and
here
i
think
is
a
very
calculated
attempt
to
play
on
this
weakness
and
to
direct
activities
at
us
that
will
compel
us
to
take
some
action
not
because
we’re
persuaded
it’s
correct
but
simply
because
we
need
to
buy
peace.
we
don’t
want
to
cause
embarrassment
to
our
neighbors,
we
don’t
want
to
see
neighbor
turned
against
neighbor.
we
don’t
want
our
families
disrupted.
and
i
think
we’re
getting
now
at
the
areas
that
really
go
to
the
core
of
privacy.
if
privacy
means
anything
at
all,
it
should
grant
us
protection
in
the
area
of
our
homes,
in
the
area
of
our
relationships
with
our
neighbors
and
our
communal
relationships.
the
organization
for
better
austin
takes
the
position
that
it
has
an
absolute
and
unqualified
right
to
hand
bill
whenever
and
wherever
it
intends
for
whatever
purpose
it
cares
to
do
it.
it
seeks
to
treat
hand
billing
under
all
circumstances
as
the
equivalent
of
newspaper
distribution
and
i
think
looking
at
what
has
occurred
here,
that
that
would
be
sloganeering
to
say
that
it
is
always
entitled
to
that
same
protection.
i
think
there
is
hand
billing
in
hand
billing.
certainly,
in
many,
many
instances,
it
is
clearly
entitled
to
full
first
amendment
protection
but
i
think
the
conduct
of
the
organization
for
better
austin
here
is
more
akin
to
our
peaceful
picketing
cases,
in
which
we
have
said
certainly,
this
is
a
protected
first
amendment
activity.
it
is
communication
but
it
is
something
more
than
communication
and
being
something
more
than
speech
pure,
we
are
entitled
to
reasonably
regulate.
i
think
hughes
versus
the
superior
court
has
decided
some
20
years
by
this
court
is
a
good
example
of
such
circumstances.
in
the
hughes
case,
they
enjoined
peaceful
picketing
by
negroes
who
were
seeking
to
urge
a
store
at
which
they
shopped
to
hire
in
proportion
to
their
negro
trade.
the
court
there
held
that
such
activity
could
be
examined
to
see
what
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
was.
the
purpose
having
been
examined
and
found
to
be
improper,
the
court
said
it
was
subject
to
reasonable
regulation
by
the
state
of
california.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
temporary
order
restricts
only
their
physical
presence
in
the
community
of
westchester.
i
think
one
of
the
serious
issues
we
have
here
is
whether
in
contemporary
america
with
our
many
confrontations,
dissent,
protest,
that
whether
we
will
permit
the
residential
neighborhood
to
become
a
part
of
the
battlefield.
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
is
the
effective
place
to
fight
the
battle.
men
who
could
not
be
persuaded
by
reasoning,
men
who
could
not
be
deterred
by
economic
pressures
may
certainly
be
forced
by
pressure
placed
upon
their
family
life
and
their
communal
relations
to
take
acts
which
they
would
not
otherwise
be
willing
to
take.
i
think
we
should
consider
and
look
at
this
case
the
heavy
burden
upon
our
public
servants
that
who
guide
our
cities
in
the
urban
problems
that
they
have.
it
was
not
too
long
ago,
this
court
had
before
it
the
gregory
case
which
involved
a
march
in
the
vicinity
of
mayor
daley’s
neighborhood
and
i
think
thought
was
given
us
to
whether
this
type
of
activity
should
be
encouraged
or
permitted
which
is
so
disruptive
of
family
and
neighborhood
life.
i
think
the
activity
here
by
the
organization
for
better
austin,
in
so
far
as
it
was
directed
towards
the
community
at
which
mr.
keefe
resides
suffers
from
the
same
vice.
indeed,
i
would
say,
it
resembles
here
residential
picketing
which
in
every
reported
case,
it
has
been
concluded
that
residential
picketing
has
either
been
enjoined,
it
has
either
been
made
the
subject
of
a
criminal
sanction
or
administrative
cease
and
desist
order.
there
is
no
reported
case
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
and
i
refer
also
to
professor
kayman’s
article
on
residential
picketing
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
the
injunction
order,
there
had
been
no
residential
picketing
in
westchester,
mr.
justice.
the
injunction
order
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
in
his
neighborhood,
at
his
church
and
in
his
shopping
center
of
the
handbills.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
i
think
we
are
to
this
extent.
when
you
consider
what
residential
picketing
is,
it’s
not
typical
picketing.
you
are
not
trying
to
keep
people
from
passing
in
or
out
of
a
residence.
there’s
not
the
element
of
intimidation
at
least
in
the
reported
cases
but
you
have
one
or
a
group
of
people
standing
in
front
of
someone’s
home
with
some
form
of
message
usually
of
a
derogatory
nature.
now,
i
see
no
particular
difference
as
far
as
the
homeowner
is
concerned
between
having
someone
stand
in
from
of
his
home
with
a
derogatory
placard
that
can
only
be
seen
by
his
neighbors
for
the
most
part
and
going
door-to-door
with
that
same
message
and
distributing
to
them.
so,
i
think
the
conduct
of
the
organization
for
better
austin
here
is
very
analogous
to
what
our
residential
picketing
situations
are.
the
court
recently
in
the
rowland
case,
the
head
occasion
to
consider
in
a
different
context
of
course,
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
light
to
be
let
alone
which
must
be
balanced
with
the
right
of
others
to
communicate.
and
i
think
we
are
faced
again
with
a
similar
resolution
of
conflicting
rights
here.
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
there
you
were
involved
with
the
mail
order
--
mr.
thomas
w.
mcnamara
yes,
i
don’t
claim
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
a
analogy
to
the
rowland
case
but
i
do
think
the
opinion
expressed
there
that
there
must
be
a
balancing
in
certain
circumstances
between
the
right
to
communicate
on
the
one
hand
and
the
right
to
be
left
alone
on
the
other
has
applicability
to
this
case.
i
might
say
parenthetically,
the
state
of
illinois
last
december
15th
has
adopted
a
new
constitution
which
is
part
of
its
bill
of
rights
has
expressly
provided
for
the
right
of
privacy
along
with
the
--
as
part
of
the
search
and
seizure
provision
of
the
act.
in
summary,
i
would
say
because
we
accept
and
tolerate
this
part
of
our
society,
what
i
would
consider
incidental
invasions
of
our
privacy
for
a
greater
good
because
the
freedom
of
the
press,
because
of
circulation
of
ideas.
i
do
not
think
that
--
we
must
therefore
legitimize
direct,
intentional
invasions
of
privacy
made
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
conduct
which
can’t
--
cannot
otherwise
be
secured
where
the
purpose
of
communicating
is
obviously
secondary.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
