you’ve
given
us
the
18,000
figure,
does
the
record
the
squirm
mileage
of
westchester?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
be
small
place;
could
be
a
large
one,
geographically?
justice
william

douglas
mr.
long,
does
the
record
contained
evidence
that
leaflets
were
distributed
at
his
church
on
sunday?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
have
any
comment
as
to
the
propriety
of
that
particular
aspect
of
your
leafleting?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
doesn’t
your
argument
really
come
down
the
geography
because
you
were
permitted
to
distribute
leaflets
in
austin
and
what
you’re
really
complaining
about
is
westchester?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
a
geographical
argument
rather
than
one
of
such
broader
breadth
as
your
last
remarks
were.
