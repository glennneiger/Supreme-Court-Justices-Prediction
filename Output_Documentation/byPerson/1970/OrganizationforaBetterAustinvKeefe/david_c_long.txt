mr.
david
c.
long
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
first
district.
that
court
has
approved
an
injunction
which
prohibits
petitioners
from
passing
up
literature
of
any
kind,
and
from
picketing
anywhere
in
the
city
of
westchester,
illinois.
this
blanket
prohibition
on
first
amendment
activities
has
been
in
effect
for
now
over
three
years.
petitioner,
the
organization
for
better
austin,
who
i
will
refer
to
as
the
oba
is
an
integrated
community
organization
in
austin
which
is
a
racially-changing
neighborhood
in
the
city
of
chicago’s
far
west
side.
the
individual
petitioners
are
certain
officers
and
members
of
the
oba
and
the
chairman
of
its
real
estate
practices
committee.
mr.
david
c.
long
respondent’s
brief
refers
to
it
as
being
seven
miles.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
the
exact
distance
but
in
general,
the
austin
community
is
the
next
chicago
community
to
oak
park
which
is
the
first
western
suburb
and
then
westchester
is
further
west
than
that.
mr.
david
c.
long
they’re
not
adjacent.
mr.
david
c.
long
they’re
roughly
connected
by
some
side
roads
and
a
freeway.
mr.
david
c.
long
westchester,
according
to
the
‘60
census
is
18,000
persons,
approximately.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
we
--
mr.
david
c.
long
briefly,
we
--
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
let
me
deal
with
it
right
now
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
set
out
that
this
has
been
--
the
injunction
was
issued
although
denominated
temporary
after
a
full
hearing
or
at
least
as
full
hearing
as
the
parties
wished
at
that
time
which
laid
out
the
activities
and
the
claim
which
mr.
--
the
basis
of
mr.
keefe’s
claim
that
his
rights
have
been
invaded.
we
admitted
the
activities
in
the
trial
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
the
pamphlets
which
are
in
evidence
were
submitted
by
defendants
because
defendants
firmly
believed
that
all
of
this
material
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
attempted,
we
were
candid
about
their
activities.
also,
we
indicated
that
our
sole
client,
our
sole
defense
was
first
amendment
and
i’ll
call
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
logan
valley
case,
the
food
employees
versus
logan
valley
case
which
arose
in
almost
in
identical
factual
situation.
i
believe
it
was
an
interlocutory
or
temporary
injunction
which
was
considered
final
by
this
court
because
it
remained
in
effect
until
modified
by
the
court
and
the
same
is
true
as
we’ve
set
out
in
our
reply
brief
with
respect
to
temporary
injunctions
under
illinois
law.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
if
that
--
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
according
to,
as
i
read
the
logan
valley
case,
it’s
final
because
it
remains
in
effect
until
it
could
be
modified.
also
we
have
no
other
defense
but
the
first
amendment
defense.
so,
for
our
purposes,
--
mr.
david
c.
long
that’s
correct
and
it
would
be
speculation
on
my
part
to
suggest
to
the
court
what
the
result
would
have
been
one
way
or
the
other
if
it
had
gone
to
a
final
--
mr.
david
c.
long
hearings.
mr.
david
c.
long
the
case
will
be
remanded
and
under
illinois
procedures,
i
suppose
we
could
move
to
dissolve
or
the
respondent
could
move
to
ask
that
the
final
order
be
entered,
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
david
c.
long
factually,
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
dispute
between
the
parties
that
there
are
additional
facts,
material
facts
which
we
would
attempt
to
get
before
this
court
if
it
came
here
again.
mr.
david
c.
long
the
respondent
jerome
keefe
is
a
real
estate
broker.
it
has
business
in
petitioner’s
neighborhood
in
austin
and
the
oba
believed
that
his
active
solicitation
of
persons
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
to
sell
their
homes
constituted,--
contributed
to
the
rapid
change
over
of
portions
of
the
community
from
integrated
to
all
black.
in
short,
petitioners
claim
that
respondent
was
a
panic
peddler.
in
the
oba,
at
a
meeting
in
austin
to
which
respondent
cane
asked
questions
to
the
respondent
and
asked
him
to
sign
on
a
solicitation
agreement.
respondent
refused
and
it’s
following
that
refusal
that
the
literature
distribution
in
question
here
took
place.
some
members
of
the
oba
distributed
literature
by
hand
in
the
westchester
community
in
which
the
respondent
lived.
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
with
respect
to
this
distribution
after
the
evidentiary
hearing
which
is
as
follows
that
the
petitioner’s
distribution
of
leaflets
and
i
quote
“was
in
all
occasions
conducted
in
a
peaceful
and
orderly
manner,
did
not
caused
any
disruption
of
pedestrian
or
vehicular
traffic
and
did
not
precipitate
any
fights,
disturbances
or
other
breaches
of
the
peace.
this
literature
was
distributed
on
five
different
occasions
over
a
two-month
period
and
it
was
distributed
by
leaving
it
at
the
doorsteps
or
in
the
handle
of
the
screen
door
in
various
residence
in
respondent’s
neighborhood.
unlike
martin
v.
struthers,
i
might
add
parenthetically,
no
residents
were
summoned
to
the
door
to
receive
them
and
there
are
no
complaints
from
these
residents
that
they
were
in
any
way
disturbed.
they
were
distributed
at
the
shopping
center
and
they
were
distributed
in
front
of
a
church
to
which
respondent
says
he
belongs.
however,
irrespective
of
this
finding
that
there
was
no
disruption,
no
disturbance
whatsoever.
the
trial
court
have
enjoined
petitioners
and
i
quote
“from
passing
of
pamphlets,
leaflets
or
literature
of
any
kind
and
from
picketing
anywhere
in
the
city
or
westchester,
illinois.”
this
is
the
injunction
which
has
been
in
effect
now
for
three
years.
however,
while
refusing
to
enjoin
picketing,
peaceful
picketing
at
respondent’s
office
in
austin,
the
trial
court
did
enjoin
all
picketing
in
the
city
of
westchester
and
it
did
this
absent
any
evidence
that
petitioners
had
engaged
in
any
picketing
in
westchester.
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
sustained
its
blanket
injunction
which
the
trial
court
had
entered
and
came
to
the
unprecedented
conclusion
in
sustaining
it
that
petitioners
had
no
first
amendment
rights.
there
were
no
first
amendment
rights
involved
here
and
the
appellate
court
justified
this
conclusion
on
two
basis.
first,
i
quote,
“the
purpose
of
the
defendants
was
not
to
inform
the
public
of
a
matter
of
public
interest
but
the
sole
purpose
was
to
force
plaintiff
to
sign
a
no-solicitation
agreement.”
the
court
did
not
consider
relevant
to
its
determination
on
this
issue
whether
the
subject
of
respondent’s
real
estate
activities
in
a
racially
changing
area
was
a
matter
of
public
interest
or
public
concern.
the
appellate
court
also
justified
making
westchester
off
limits
to
petitioner’s
distribution
of
leaflets
on
the
basis
of
a
determination
that
respondent’s
right
of
privacy
was
invaded
by
this
distribution.
and
finally,
the
appellate
court
held
that
the
scope
of
this
restraint
namely
everywhere
in
the
city
of
18,000
persons
on
both
literature
distribution
and
picketing,
was
not
overly
broad.
i’d
like
to
treat
first
that
liberty
which
the
constitution
has
traditionally
afforded
to
the
peaceful
and
orderly
distribution
of
literature
by
hand,
the
doctrine
of
no-prior
restraint,
then
consider
how
the
appellate
court’s
justification
where
its
conclusion
that
the
right
free
speech
is
not
involved
here,
does
not
comport
with
the
long
history
of
decisions
involving
the
first
amendment
by
this
court.
mr.
david
c.
long
we
filed
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
which
was
denied
in
january
1970,
following
that,
we
petitioned
for
certiorari.
historically,
the
liberty
of
press
and
freedom
of
speech
has
embraced
pamphlets
and
leaflets
as
well
as
books
and
newspapers.
leaflets
distributed
on
streets
and
sidewalks,
door-to-door
and
in
shopping
centers
have
been
the
backbone
of
political
campaigns,
religious
evangelism,
and
have
played
a
major
role
in
the
advocacy
of
social,
political
and
economic
causes.
restraints
such
as
imposed
here
on
the
distribution
of
non-commercial
literature
at
such
places
have
been
uniformly
held
unconstitutional.
in
the
past
states
who
attempted
to
justify
outright
prohibition
and
various
other
less
serious
restraints
in
terms
of
the
one
here
on
a
variety
of
grounds
to
prevent
littering
as
the
schneider
case
because
it’s
unpopular,
annoying
or
distasteful
which
is
murdoch
because
of
privacy
martin
v.
struther
or
the
possibility
of
fraud
which
is
schneider
and
talley.
the
various
restraints
which
have
been
held
unconstitutional
have
included
of
course
outright
prohibition
which
is
what
is
before
the
court
today.
outright
prohibition
within
a
whole
town,
the
schneider
case
was
by
ordinance,
here
it’s
by
injunction.
but
it’s
also
struck
down
numerous,
less
serious
and
less
complete
restraints.
license
requirements
and
lovell,
taxation
in
murdoch
or
by
it
has
held
unconstitutional
provision
on
anonymity,
the
talley
case.
and
all
of
these
have
been
less
serious
except
for
the
outright
prohibition
which
is
equivalent
to
this
restraint
here.
moreover,
of
all
the
forums
of
restraint
which
have
been
held
unconstitutional,
that
which
has
been
considered
most
serious
and
most
irreparable
as
prior
restraint.
indeed,
the
landmark
case
of
near
versus
minnesota
condemned
the
very
type
of
restraint
which
has
been
been
imposed
here,
where
it
was
an
injunction
against
the
future
publication
and
circulation
of
alleged,
malicious,
scandalous
and
defamatory
newspapers.
mr.
david
c.
long
that’s
true
and
the
damage
remedy
would
of
course
be
subject
to
the
new
york
times
standard.
the
petitioner
certainly
has
thrust
himself
under
the
vortex,
so
to
speak,
the
public
life
and
the
public
issues
of
austin
qualifying
for
a
public
figure
but
that
issue
is
of
course
not
before
the
courts
since
there
has
been
no
finding
of
falsity
that
we’re
dealing
with
--
mr.
david
c.
long
that’s
correct.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
wouldn't
purport
to
attempt
to
answer
that
your
honor.
the
basic
evil
of
the
prior
restraint
is
that
as
in
this
case,
regardless
whether
where
you
have
a
wrong
--
if
you
have
a
wrongful
restraint
and
the
injunction
is
reversed
on
appeal,
that
injunction
will
still
have
prohibited
the
conduct
which
is
subsequently
held
to
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
for
the
duration
of
the
time
it
took
to
appeal
it.
this
was
the
situation
in
the
birmingham
cases,
shuttlesworth
versus
birmingham
and
the
walker
versus
birmingham
where
the
state,
a
state
law
which
can
prohibit
a
person,
who
is
held
in
or
was
brought
before
the
court
in
a
contempt
proceeding
from
raising
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
held
to
be
a
valid
exercise
of
state
power.
turning
now
to
the
appellate
court’s
justification
for
this
sweeping
prior
restraint,
i
would
like
to
first
examine
the
court’s
determination
that
there
was
an
invasion
of
privacy.
given
the
scope
of
the
injunction
here,
namely
anywhere
in
westchester,
it
is
implicit
that
the
appellate
court
made
the
determination
that
all
of
westchester
is
within
a
zone
of
privacy,
personal
to
respondent.
mr.
david
c.
long
and
that
within
this
zone
of
privacy
petitioner’s
first
amendment
activities
of
passing
out
literature
in
an
orderly
and
peaceful
manner
critical
of
respondent’s
real
estate
activities
in
austin
violated
his
privacy.
indeed,
it
is
implicit
that
any
literature
regardless
of
its
content
given
the
fact
that
the
injunction
goes
to
all
literature
regardless
of
what
it
says
would
have
invaded
respondent’s
privacy
if
distributed
by
respondents.
in
so
doing,
the
--
mr.
david
c.
long
no
it
does
not
and
i
have
no
idea
what
it
is.
mr.
david
c.
long
from
my
knowledge
of
the
western
suburbs,
these
are
all
single-family
houses,
so
i
would
assume
that
it
was
a
quite
a
low
density
area
perhaps
with
a
few
apartments
but
certainly
not
of
urban
density.
i
believe
that
the
illinois
courts
in
this
determination
of
privacy
have
disregarded
the
authority
of
time
v.
hill
which
held
that
the
first
amendment
rights
are
applicable
where
the
state
attempts
to
create
rights
of
privacy.
indeed,
--
mr.
david
c.
long
your
honor,
time
v.
hill
was,
i
believe
a
privacy
action
where
the
court
said
that
the
nature
of
the
harm
which
the
plaintiff
sought
to
redress
was
emotional
harm
to
himself
rather
than
based
on
damage
to
his
reputation
which
is
one
of
the
classic
formulations
of
the
privacy
action
and
--
mr.
david
c.
long
no,
that’s
correct
and
we’re
using
time
in
an
a
fortiori
sense
that
if
a
restraint
cannot
be
justified
in
the
context
of
subsequent
punishment,
it
certainly
cannot
be
justified
in
terms
of
a
more
serious
restraint
which
is
prior
restraint.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
know
of
no
case
which
is
near
near
versus
minnesota.
cases
which
the
respondent
has
cited
which
were
involved
in
injunction
have
all
been
picketing
cases
and
respondents
ask
this
court
to
declare
that
the
distribution
of
literature
is
equivalent
to
picketing.
something
which
is
contrary
to
the
long
established
precedence
of
the
court
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
time,
the
first
amendment
standards
which
overcame
the
privacy
cause
of
action
there
were
in
the
context
of
false
statements
or
as
i’ve
indicated,
there’s
been
no
finding
of
falsity
here.
furthermore,
the
illinois
has
created
a
new
and
surprising
definition
of
privacy
to
justify
this
restraint
on
first
amendment
conduct.
the
law
of
privacy
has
here
before
never
purported
to
prohibit
the
distribution
of
written
materials
concerning
a
person’s
business
activities
which
relate
to
public
issues
of
interest
and
concern.
taking
two
heads
of
privacy
which
respondent
may
argue
are
applicable
here
which
have
traditionally
been
brought
within
the
notions
of
privacy
in
its
brief
history
since
warren-brandeis
article,
that
is
first
there
has
been
interference
with
respondent’s
peaceful
enjoinment
of
his
home
and
property.
here,
the
distribution
was
the
third
persons
in
westchester,
in
a
shopping
center,
door-to-door.
there
has
been
no
unreasonable
publicity
given
to
his
private
life
another
head,
traditional
privacy
law.
not
just
the
matter
of
public
interest
but
it
concerned
respondents’
public
activities.
indeed,
activities
which
he
went
to
a
public
meeting
in
austin
to
discuss.
the
appellate
court’s
opinion
gives
us
an
indication
of
what
the
nature
of
this
newly
created
illinois
privacy
right
is
when
it
says
there’s
no
evidence
to
show
that
plaintiff
was
engaged
in
panic
peddling
in
westchester
or
that
he
intended
to
do
business
in
westchester.
the
appellate
court
is
apparently
making
a
determination
that
the
subject
of
respondent’s
activities
in
austin
is
inappropriate
for
westchester
in
the
distribution
of
leaflets
on
this
subject
does
invade
respondent’s
privacy.
it’s
significant
to
note
however
that
the
court
refused
to
enjoin
picketing
in
austin.
so,
presumably,
the
subject
matter
of
respondent’s
activities
was
considered
appropriate
for
austin
but
not
for
westchester
which
even
attempting
to
use
the
unlawful
purpose
doctrine
announced
in
a
number
of
picketing
cases
would
create
the
anomalous
situation
of
--
if
not
being
against
public
policy
to
talk
about
or
to
distribute
material
concerning
a
particular
issue
in
one
place
but
in
another,
absence
of
determination
that
the
manner
itself
was
somehow
objectionable.
mr.
david
c.
long
yes
it
does.
mr.
david
c.
long
your
honor,
i
would
refrain
from
commenting
on
the
propriety
of
that.
i
think,
the
issue
would
have
to
be
posed
assuming
there
was
a
charge
of
privacy
violation
in
terms
of
was
respondent
there,
didn’t
interfere
with
his
worship.
that
is
whether
there
was
a
conflict
between
his
right
to
worship
and
first
amendment
rights
because
i
don’t
think
that
a
person
going
to
and
from
a
church
service
out
on
a
sidewalk
has
a
right
to
be
free
from
the
distribution
of
leaflets
or
a
newspaper
critical
of
a
respondent,
if
you
will,
a
written
material.
respondent
indeed
never
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
this
was
petitioners
who
said,
“we
did
this.”
and
respondent
doesn’t
say
he
was
there.
so
there’s
--
mr.
david
c.
long
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
respondent
had
an
opportunity
at
that
hearing
to
tell
the
court
what
the
harm
was
to
him.
and
--
mr.
david
c.
long
no,
that’s
true.
the
issue
certainly
is
that
we’re
proposing
to
the
court
is
whether
the
evidence
justifies
this
type
of
sweeping
injunction.
i
think
’sperhaps
speculative
to
consider
at
this
point
what
evidence
might
justify
such
an
injunction,
suffice
to
say
that
no
facts
justifying
it
here
in
your
position.
what
the
court
has
done
has
set
up
a
suburban
enclave
into
which
certain
subject
matter
or
the
distribution
of
literature
by
hand
cannot
enter.
furthermore,
it
has
granted
him
censorship
power
both
over
the
literature
which
petitioners
can
distribute
and
over
the
literature
which
other
residents
of
westchester
can
receive.
now,
aside
from
the
asserted
invasion
of
privacy
here,
the
other
justification
for
the
injunction
is
that
the
distribution
was
not
deemed
to
for
proper
purpose.
the
appellate
court
says
in
its
opinion,
i
quote,
“the
purpose
of
the
defendants
was
not
to
inform
the
public
of
a
matter
of
public
interest
but
the
sole
purpose
was
to
force
plaintiff
to
sign
a
no-solicitation
agreement.”
that
is
an
agreement
that
he
would
not
solicit
sellers
to
sell
their
homes
in
austin.
but
speech
does
not
lose
its
protection
of
speech
because
it
seeks
to
influence
events
or
persuade
to
lawful
action.
indeed,
this
court
in
the
recent
brandenburg
case
reaffirmed
the
right
advocate
unlawful
action
except
where
that
advocacy
is
directed
to
producing
immanent
lawless
action
and
where
it
is
likely
to
insight
or
produce
such
action.
mr.
david
c.
long
mr.
justice
white,
--
mr.
david
c.
long
under
it
--
i’m
trying
to
--
i’m
sorry
if
i
haven’t
made
it
clear
but
i
have
been
trying
to
confine
my
present
remarks
to
the
distribution
of
literature.
our
position
with
respect
to
picketing
is
that
it’s
overbroad.
we’re
not
taking
the
position
that
picketing
in
all
cases
cannot
be
enjoined.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
conduct
which
is
in
addition
to
the
literature
distributed.
mr.
david
c.
long
for
example,
it
might
depend
on
the
number
of
people.
mr.
david
c.
long
then
i
think
there’s
a
clear
right.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
know
of
no
authority
which
would
justify
any
other
conclusion
but
the
written
material
cannot
be
enjoined
when
it’s
distributed
by
hand
and
that
wasn’t
the
case
here
in
terms
of
the
facts.
there’s
no
evidence
that
they
were
standing
in
front
of
his
house.
mr.
david
c.
long
to
his
neighbors.
mr.
david
c.
long
just
leaving
it
at
the
doorstep.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
would
think
certainly
his
neighbors
could
be
apprised
of
his
public
activities
by
the
distribution
of
leaflets
in
the
same
manner
that
they
could
be
apprised
by
newspapers
of
such
activities.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
there
it
might
be
more
difficult
--
well,
assuming
if
his
neighbors
had
homes
and
i
should
think
they
would
be
subject
to
receiving
literature
and
have
that
literature
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
as
anywhere
else.
again,
i’m
referring
to
a
situation
which
does
not
amount
to
picketing.
that
is
patrolling
of
the
person
upon
which
the
criticism
is
made
about.
yes,
i
would
say
that.
and
that’s
how
i
read
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
what
the
illinois
appellate
court
has
done
is
decide
that
it
is
not
approved
that
first
amendment
activities
engaged
in
for
certain
purposes.
that
court’s
determination
clearly
violates
the
first
amendment
because
this
court
in
near
has
indicated
that
they
have
to
satisfy
a
judge
that
speech
is
published
with
good
motives
and
for
justifiable
ends
is
the
essence
of
censorship.
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
there
has
been
censorship
and
outright
prohibition
for
three
years.
both
of
the
appellate
court’s
justifications
for
this
prohibition
on
literature
distribution
are
dangerous
precedent.
this
precedent
could
form
the
basis
for
an
effective
system
of
censorship
and
could
justify
criminal
penalties
or
damage
award
for
those
that
speaker
right
and
distribute
literature
for
unapproved
purposes
or
in
public
places
within
this
widely
defined
zone
of
privacy.
this
is
precedent
which
licenses
that
unfortunate
human
tendency
which
is
the
antithesis
of
an
open
society
namely,
the
desire
to
suppress
the
critic,
the
advocative
change
and
the
controversy.
for
all
the
reasons
presented
here
today
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
hold
the
prohibition,
this
prohibition
by
injunction
on
first
amendment
rights
unconstitutional
and
order
that
it
be
dissolved.
mr.
david
c.
long
that’s
true.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
the
notion
of
residence
first
is
not
a
clearly
defined
concept.
people
live
throughout
any
urban
area,
so
in
the
sense
that
it
is
protecting
a
broadly
defined
residential
right
of
privacy,
here
a
city
of
18,000
is
being
within
that
zone.
it’s
precedent
for
defining
other
areas
which
constituted
residences,
as
for
example
in
chicago
or
in
the
cities
or
in
the
city
or
outer
drive
east
where
lake
point
towers
are
certainly
residential
areas
and
i
think
it
would
justify
enjoining
the
distribution
of
literature
to
persons
who
were
going
to
and
from
work
from
those
large
tower
apartments.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
don’t
know
your
honor
because
the
court
didn’t
have
before
it
that
situation
and
i
don’t
know
what
it
would’ve
done
in
that
case
but
i
think,
i
do
think
that
the
presidential
value
of
this
decision
is
far
broader
than
just
the
geographic
scope.
i
see
it
as
relating
to
a
court
deciding
that
certain
purposes
are
unapproved
or
be
it
for
a
certain
geographical
area
to
talk
about
certain
things
in
and
i
think
the
notion
of
privacy
here
is
extremely
dangerous.
mr.
david
c.
long
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
first
district.
that
court
has
approved
an
injunction
which
prohibits
petitioners
from
passing
up
literature
of
any
kind,
and
from
picketing
anywhere
in
the
city
of
westchester,
illinois.
this
blanket
prohibition
on
first
amendment
activities
has
been
in
effect
for
now
over
three
years.
petitioner,
the
organization
for
better
austin,
who
i
will
refer
to
as
the
oba
is
an
integrated
community
organization
in
austin
which
is
a
racially-changing
neighborhood
in
the
city
of
chicago’s
far
west
side.
the
individual
petitioners
are
certain
officers
and
members
of
the
oba
and
the
chairman
of
its
real
estate
practices
committee.
mr.
david
c.
long
respondent’s
brief
refers
to
it
as
being
seven
miles.
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
the
exact
distance
but
in
general,
the
austin
community
is
the
next
chicago
community
to
oak
park
which
is
the
first
western
suburb
and
then
westchester
is
further
west
than
that.
mr.
david
c.
long
they’re
not
adjacent.
mr.
david
c.
long
they’re
roughly
connected
by
some
side
roads
and
a
freeway.
mr.
david
c.
long
westchester,
according
to
the
‘60
census
is
18,000
persons,
approximately.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
we
--
mr.
david
c.
long
briefly,
we
--
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
let
me
deal
with
it
right
now
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
set
out
that
this
has
been
--
the
injunction
was
issued
although
denominated
temporary
after
a
full
hearing
or
at
least
as
full
hearing
as
the
parties
wished
at
that
time
which
laid
out
the
activities
and
the
claim
which
mr.
--
the
basis
of
mr.
keefe’s
claim
that
his
rights
have
been
invaded.
we
admitted
the
activities
in
the
trial
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
the
pamphlets
which
are
in
evidence
were
submitted
by
defendants
because
defendants
firmly
believed
that
all
of
this
material
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
attempted,
we
were
candid
about
their
activities.
also,
we
indicated
that
our
sole
client,
our
sole
defense
was
first
amendment
and
i’ll
call
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
logan
valley
case,
the
food
employees
versus
logan
valley
case
which
arose
in
almost
in
identical
factual
situation.
i
believe
it
was
an
interlocutory
or
temporary
injunction
which
was
considered
final
by
this
court
because
it
remained
in
effect
until
modified
by
the
court
and
the
same
is
true
as
we’ve
set
out
in
our
reply
brief
with
respect
to
temporary
injunctions
under
illinois
law.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
if
that
--
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
according
to,
as
i
read
the
logan
valley
case,
it’s
final
because
it
remains
in
effect
until
it
could
be
modified.
also
we
have
no
other
defense
but
the
first
amendment
defense.
so,
for
our
purposes,
--
mr.
david
c.
long
that’s
correct
and
it
would
be
speculation
on
my
part
to
suggest
to
the
court
what
the
result
would
have
been
one
way
or
the
other
if
it
had
gone
to
a
final
--
mr.
david
c.
long
hearings.
mr.
david
c.
long
the
case
will
be
remanded
and
under
illinois
procedures,
i
suppose
we
could
move
to
dissolve
or
the
respondent
could
move
to
ask
that
the
final
order
be
entered,
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
david
c.
long
factually,
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
dispute
between
the
parties
that
there
are
additional
facts,
material
facts
which
we
would
attempt
to
get
before
this
court
if
it
came
here
again.
mr.
david
c.
long
the
respondent
jerome
keefe
is
a
real
estate
broker.
it
has
business
in
petitioner’s
neighborhood
in
austin
and
the
oba
believed
that
his
active
solicitation
of
persons
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
to
sell
their
homes
constituted,--
contributed
to
the
rapid
change
over
of
portions
of
the
community
from
integrated
to
all
black.
in
short,
petitioners
claim
that
respondent
was
a
panic
peddler.
in
the
oba,
at
a
meeting
in
austin
to
which
respondent
cane
asked
questions
to
the
respondent
and
asked
him
to
sign
on
a
solicitation
agreement.
respondent
refused
and
it’s
following
that
refusal
that
the
literature
distribution
in
question
here
took
place.
some
members
of
the
oba
distributed
literature
by
hand
in
the
westchester
community
in
which
the
respondent
lived.
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
with
respect
to
this
distribution
after
the
evidentiary
hearing
which
is
as
follows
that
the
petitioner’s
distribution
of
leaflets
and
i
quote
“was
in
all
occasions
conducted
in
a
peaceful
and
orderly
manner,
did
not
caused
any
disruption
of
pedestrian
or
vehicular
traffic
and
did
not
precipitate
any
fights,
disturbances
or
other
breaches
of
the
peace.
this
literature
was
distributed
on
five
different
occasions
over
a
two-month
period
and
it
was
distributed
by
leaving
it
at
the
doorsteps
or
in
the
handle
of
the
screen
door
in
various
residence
in
respondent’s
neighborhood.
unlike
martin
v.
struthers,
i
might
add
parenthetically,
no
residents
were
summoned
to
the
door
to
receive
them
and
there
are
no
complaints
from
these
residents
that
they
were
in
any
way
disturbed.
they
were
distributed
at
the
shopping
center
and
they
were
distributed
in
front
of
a
church
to
which
respondent
says
he
belongs.
however,
irrespective
of
this
finding
that
there
was
no
disruption,
no
disturbance
whatsoever.
the
trial
court
have
enjoined
petitioners
and
i
quote
“from
passing
of
pamphlets,
leaflets
or
literature
of
any
kind
and
from
picketing
anywhere
in
the
city
or
westchester,
illinois.”
this
is
the
injunction
which
has
been
in
effect
now
for
three
years.
however,
while
refusing
to
enjoin
picketing,
peaceful
picketing
at
respondent’s
office
in
austin,
the
trial
court
did
enjoin
all
picketing
in
the
city
of
westchester
and
it
did
this
absent
any
evidence
that
petitioners
had
engaged
in
any
picketing
in
westchester.
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
sustained
its
blanket
injunction
which
the
trial
court
had
entered
and
came
to
the
unprecedented
conclusion
in
sustaining
it
that
petitioners
had
no
first
amendment
rights.
there
were
no
first
amendment
rights
involved
here
and
the
appellate
court
justified
this
conclusion
on
two
basis.
first,
i
quote,
“the
purpose
of
the
defendants
was
not
to
inform
the
public
of
a
matter
of
public
interest
but
the
sole
purpose
was
to
force
plaintiff
to
sign
a
no-solicitation
agreement.”
the
court
did
not
consider
relevant
to
its
determination
on
this
issue
whether
the
subject
of
respondent’s
real
estate
activities
in
a
racially
changing
area
was
a
matter
of
public
interest
or
public
concern.
the
appellate
court
also
justified
making
westchester
off
limits
to
petitioner’s
distribution
of
leaflets
on
the
basis
of
a
determination
that
respondent’s
right
of
privacy
was
invaded
by
this
distribution.
and
finally,
the
appellate
court
held
that
the
scope
of
this
restraint
namely
everywhere
in
the
city
of
18,000
persons
on
both
literature
distribution
and
picketing,
was
not
overly
broad.
i’d
like
to
treat
first
that
liberty
which
the
constitution
has
traditionally
afforded
to
the
peaceful
and
orderly
distribution
of
literature
by
hand,
the
doctrine
of
no-prior
restraint,
then
consider
how
the
appellate
court’s
justification
where
its
conclusion
that
the
right
free
speech
is
not
involved
here,
does
not
comport
with
the
long
history
of
decisions
involving
the
first
amendment
by
this
court.
mr.
david
c.
long
we
filed
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
which
was
denied
in
january
1970,
following
that,
we
petitioned
for
certiorari.
historically,
the
liberty
of
press
and
freedom
of
speech
has
embraced
pamphlets
and
leaflets
as
well
as
books
and
newspapers.
leaflets
distributed
on
streets
and
sidewalks,
door-to-door
and
in
shopping
centers
have
been
the
backbone
of
political
campaigns,
religious
evangelism,
and
have
played
a
major
role
in
the
advocacy
of
social,
political
and
economic
causes.
restraints
such
as
imposed
here
on
the
distribution
of
non-commercial
literature
at
such
places
have
been
uniformly
held
unconstitutional.
in
the
past
states
who
attempted
to
justify
outright
prohibition
and
various
other
less
serious
restraints
in
terms
of
the
one
here
on
a
variety
of
grounds
to
prevent
littering
as
the
schneider
case
because
it’s
unpopular,
annoying
or
distasteful
which
is
murdoch
because
of
privacy
martin
v.
struther
or
the
possibility
of
fraud
which
is
schneider
and
talley.
the
various
restraints
which
have
been
held
unconstitutional
have
included
of
course
outright
prohibition
which
is
what
is
before
the
court
today.
outright
prohibition
within
a
whole
town,
the
schneider
case
was
by
ordinance,
here
it’s
by
injunction.
but
it’s
also
struck
down
numerous,
less
serious
and
less
complete
restraints.
license
requirements
and
lovell,
taxation
in
murdoch
or
by
it
has
held
unconstitutional
provision
on
anonymity,
the
talley
case.
and
all
of
these
have
been
less
serious
except
for
the
outright
prohibition
which
is
equivalent
to
this
restraint
here.
moreover,
of
all
the
forums
of
restraint
which
have
been
held
unconstitutional,
that
which
has
been
considered
most
serious
and
most
irreparable
as
prior
restraint.
indeed,
the
landmark
case
of
near
versus
minnesota
condemned
the
very
type
of
restraint
which
has
been
been
imposed
here,
where
it
was
an
injunction
against
the
future
publication
and
circulation
of
alleged,
malicious,
scandalous
and
defamatory
newspapers.
mr.
david
c.

that’s
true
and
the
damage

of
course

certainly
has
thrust
himself
under
the
vortex,
so
to
speak,
the
public
life
and
the
public
issues
of
austin
qualifying
for
a
public
figure
but
that
issue
is
of
course
not
before
the
courts
since
there
has
been
no
finding
of
falsity
that
we’re
dealing
with
--
mr.
david
c.
long
that’s
correct.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
wouldn't
purport
to
attempt
to
answer
that
your
honor.
the
basic
evil
of
the
prior
restraint
is
that
as
in
this
case,
regardless
whether
where
you
have
a
wrong
--
if
you
have
a
wrongful
restraint
and
the
injunction
is
reversed
on
appeal,
that
injunction
will
still
have
prohibited
the
conduct
which
is
subsequently
held
to
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
for
the
duration
of
the
time
it
took
to
appeal
it.
this
was
the
situation
in
the
birmingham
cases,
shuttlesworth
versus
birmingham
and
the
walker
versus
birmingham
where
the
state,
a
state
law
which
can
prohibit
a
person,
who
is
held
in
or
was
brought
before
the
court
in
a
contempt
proceeding
from
raising
the
constitutional
issue
has
been
held
to
be
a
valid
exercise
of
state
power.
turning
now
to
the
appellate
court’s
justification
for
this
sweeping
prior
restraint,
i
would
like
to
first
examine
the
court’s
determination
that
there
was
an
invasion
of
privacy.
given
the
scope
of
the
injunction
here,
namely
anywhere
in
westchester,
it
is
implicit
that
the
appellate
court
made
the
determination
that
all
of
westchester
is
within
a
zone
of
privacy,
personal
to
respondent.
mr.
david
c.
long
and
that
within
this
zone
of
privacy
petitioner’s
first
amendment
activities
of
passing
out
literature
in
an
orderly
and
peaceful
manner
critical
of
respondent’s
real
estate
activities
in
austin
violated
his
privacy.
indeed,
it
is
implicit
that
any
literature
regardless
of
its
content
given
the
fact
that
the
injunction
goes
to
all
literature
regardless
of
what
it
says
would
have
invaded
respondent’s
privacy
if
distributed
by
respondents.
in
so
doing,
the
--
mr.
david
c.
long
no
it
does
not
and
i
have
no
idea
what
it
is.
mr.
david
c.
long
from
my
knowledge
of
the
western
suburbs,
these
are
all
single-family
houses,
so
i
would
assume
that
it
was
a
quite
a
low
density
area
perhaps
with
a
few
apartments
but
certainly
not
of
urban
density.
i
believe
that
the
illinois
courts
in
this
determination
of
privacy
have
disregarded
the
authority
of
time
v.
hill
which
held
that
the
first
amendment
rights
are
applicable
where
the
state
attempts
to
create
rights
of
privacy.
indeed,
--
mr.
david
c.
long
your
honor,
time
v.
hill
was,
i
believe
a
privacy
action
where
the
court
said
that
the
nature
of
the
harm
which
the
plaintiff
sought
to
redress
was
emotional
harm
to
himself
rather
than
based
on
damage
to
his
reputation
which
is
one
of
the
classic
formulations
of
the
privacy
action
and
--
mr.
david
c.
long
no,
that’s
correct
and
we’re
using
time
in
an
a
fortiori
sense
that
if
a
restraint
cannot
be
justified
in
the
context
of
subsequent
punishment,
it
certainly
cannot
be
justified
in
terms
of
a
more
serious
restraint
which
is
prior
restraint.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
know
of
no
case
which
is
near
near
versus
minnesota.
cases
which
the
respondent
has
cited
which
were
involved
in
injunction
have
all
been
picketing
cases
and
respondents
ask
this
court
to
declare
that
the
distribution
of
literature
is
equivalent
to
picketing.
something
which
is
contrary
to
the
long
established
precedence
of
the
court
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
time,
the
first
amendment
standards
which
overcame
the
privacy
cause
of
action
there
were
in
the
context
of
false
statements
or
as
i’ve
indicated,
there’s
been
no
finding
of
falsity
here.
furthermore,
the
illinois
has
created
a
new
and
surprising
definition
of
privacy
to
justify
this
restraint
on
first
amendment
conduct.
the
law
of
privacy
has
here
before
never
purported
to
prohibit
the
distribution
of
written
materials
concerning
a
person’s
business
activities
which
relate
to
public
issues
of
interest
and
concern.
taking
two
heads
of
privacy
which
respondent
may
argue
are
applicable
here
which
have
traditionally
been
brought
within
the
notions
of
privacy
in
its
brief
history
since
warren-brandeis
article,
that
is
first
there
has
been
interference
with
respondent’s
peaceful
enjoinment
of
his
home
and
property.
here,
the
distribution
was
the
third
persons
in
westchester,
in
a
shopping
center,
door-to-door.
there
has
been
no
unreasonable
publicity
given
to
his
private
life
another
head,
traditional
privacy
law.
not
just
the
matter
of
public
interest
but
it
concerned
respondents’
public
activities.
indeed,
activities
which
he
went
to
a
public
meeting
in
austin
to
discuss.
the
appellate
court’s
opinion
gives
us
an
indication
of
what
the
nature
of
this
newly
created
illinois
privacy
right
is
when
it
says
there’s
no
evidence
to
show
that
plaintiff
was
engaged
in
panic
peddling
in
westchester
or
that
he
intended
to
do
business
in
westchester.
the
appellate
court
is
apparently
making
a
determination
that
the
subject
of
respondent’s
activities
in
austin
is
inappropriate
for
westchester
in
the
distribution
of
leaflets
on
this
subject
does
invade
respondent’s
privacy.
it’s
significant
to
note
however
that
the
court
refused
to
enjoin
picketing
in
austin.
so,
presumably,
the
subject
matter
of
respondent’s
activities
was
considered
appropriate
for
austin
but
not
for
westchester
which
even
attempting
to
use
the
unlawful
purpose
doctrine
announced
in
a
number
of
picketing
cases
would
create
the
anomalous
situation
of
--
if
not
being
against
public
policy
to
talk
about
or
to
distribute
material
concerning
a
particular
issue
in
one
place
but
in
another,
absence
of
determination
that
the
manner
itself
was
somehow
objectionable.
mr.
david
c.
long
yes
it
does.
mr.
david
c.
long
your
honor,
i
would
refrain
from
commenting
on
the
propriety
of
that.
i
think,
the
issue
would
have
to
be
posed
assuming
there
was
a
charge
of
privacy
violation
in
terms
of
was
respondent
there,
didn’t
interfere
with
his
worship.
that
is
whether
there
was
a
conflict
between
his
right
to
worship
and
first
amendment
rights
because
i
don’t
think
that
a
person
going
to
and
from
a
church
service
out
on
a
sidewalk
has
a
right
to
be
free
from
the
distribution
of
leaflets
or
a
newspaper
critical
of
a
respondent,
if
you
will,
a
written
material.
respondent
indeed
never
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
this
was
petitioners
who
said,
“we
did
this.”
and
respondent
doesn’t
say
he
was
there.
so
there’s
--
mr.
david
c.
long
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
respondent
had
an
opportunity
at
that
hearing
to
tell
the
court
what
the
harm
was
to
him.
and
--
mr.
david
c.
long
no,
that’s
true.
the
issue
certainly
is
that
we’re
proposing
to
the
court
is
whether
the
evidence
justifies
this
type
of
sweeping
injunction.
i
think
’sperhaps
speculative
to
consider
at
this
point
what
evidence
might
justify
such
an
injunction,
suffice
to
say
that
no
facts
justifying
it
here
in
your
position.
what
the
court
has
done
has
set
up
a
suburban
enclave
into
which
certain
subject
matter
or
the
distribution
of
literature
by
hand
cannot
enter.
furthermore,
it
has
granted
him
censorship
power
both
over
the
literature
which
petitioners
can
distribute
and
over
the
literature
which
other
residents
of
westchester
can
receive.
now,
aside
from
the
asserted
invasion
of
privacy
here,
the
other
justification
for
the
injunction
is
that
the
distribution
was
not
deemed
to
for
proper
purpose.
the
appellate
court
says
in
its
opinion,
i
quote,
“the
purpose
of
the
defendants
was
not
to
inform
the
public
of
a
matter
of
public
interest
but
the
sole
purpose
was
to
force
plaintiff
to
sign
a
no-solicitation
agreement.”
that
is
an
agreement
that
he
would
not
solicit
sellers
to
sell
their
homes
in
austin.
but
speech
does
not
lose
its
protection
of
speech
because
it
seeks
to
influence
events
or
persuade
to
lawful
action.
indeed,
this
court
in
the
recent
brandenburg
case
reaffirmed
the
right
advocate
unlawful
action
except
where
that
advocacy
is
directed
to
producing
immanent
lawless
action
and
where
it
is
likely
to
insight
or
produce
such
action.
mr.
david
c.
long
mr.
justice
white,
--
mr.
david
c.
long
under
it
--
i’m
trying
to
--
i’m
sorry
if
i
haven’t
made
it
clear
but
i
have
been
trying
to
confine
my
present
remarks
to
the
distribution
of
literature.
our
position
with
respect
to
picketing
is
that
it’s
overbroad.
we’re
not
taking
the
position
that
picketing
in
all
cases
cannot
be
enjoined.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
conduct
which
is
in
addition
to
the
literature
distributed.
mr.
david
c.
long
for
example,
it
might
depend
on
the
number
of
people.
mr.
david
c.
long
then
i
think
there’s
a
clear
right.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
know
of
no
authority
which
would
justify
any
other
conclusion
but
the
written
material
cannot
be
enjoined
when
it’s
distributed
by
hand
and
that
wasn’t
the
case
here
in
terms
of
the
facts.
there’s
no
evidence
that
they
were
standing
in
front
of
his
house.
mr.
david
c.
long
to
his
neighbors.
mr.
david
c.
long
just
leaving
it
at
the
doorstep.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
would
think
certainly
his
neighbors
could
be
apprised
of
his
public
activities
by
the
distribution
of
leaflets
in
the
same
manner
that
they
could
be
apprised
by
newspapers
of
such
activities.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
there
it
might
be
more
difficult
--
well,
assuming
if
his
neighbors
had
homes
and
i
should
think
they
would
be
subject
to
receiving
literature
and
have
that
literature
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
as
anywhere
else.
again,
i’m
referring
to
a
situation
which
does
not
amount
to
picketing.
that
is
patrolling
of
the
person
upon
which
the
criticism
is
made
about.
yes,
i
would
say
that.
and
that’s
how
i
read
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
what
the
illinois
appellate
court
has
done
is
decide
that
it
is
not
approved
that
first
amendment
activities
engaged
in
for
certain
purposes.
that
court’s
determination
clearly
violates
the
first
amendment
because
this
court
in
near
has
indicated
that
they
have
to
satisfy
a
judge
that
speech
is
published
with
good
motives
and
for
justifiable
ends
is
the
essence
of
censorship.
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
there
has
been
censorship
and
outright
prohibition
for
three
years.
both
of
the
appellate
court’s
justifications
for
this
prohibition
on
literature
distribution
are
dangerous
precedent.
this
precedent
could
form
the
basis
for
an
effective
system
of
censorship
and
could
justify
criminal
penalties
or
damage
award
for
those
that
speaker
right
and
distribute
literature
for
unapproved
purposes
or
in
public
places
within
this
widely
defined
zone
of
privacy.
this
is
precedent
which
licenses
that
unfortunate
human
tendency
which
is
the
antithesis
of
an
open
society
namely,
the
desire
to
suppress
the
critic,
the
advocative
change
and
the
controversy.
for
all
the
reasons
presented
here
today
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
hold
the
prohibition,
this
prohibition
by
injunction
on
first
amendment
rights
unconstitutional
and
order
that
it
be
dissolved.
mr.
david
c.
long
that’s
true.
mr.
david
c.
long
well,
the
notion
of
residence
first
is
not
a
clearly
defined
concept.
people
live
throughout
any
urban
area,
so
in
the
sense
that
it
is
protecting
a
broadly
defined
residential
right
of
privacy,
here
a
city
of
18,000
is
being
within
that
zone.
it’s
precedent
for
defining
other
areas
which
constituted
residences,
as
for
example
in
chicago
or
in
the
cities
or
in
the
city
or
outer
drive
east
where
lake
point
towers
are
certainly
residential
areas
and
i
think
it
would
justify
enjoining
the
distribution
of
literature
to
persons
who
were
going
to
and
from
work
from
those
large
tower
apartments.
mr.
david
c.
long
i
don’t
know
your
honor
because
the
court
didn’t
have
before
it
that
situation
and
i
don’t
know
what
it
would’ve
done
in
that
case
but
i
think,
i
do
think
that
the
presidential
value
of
this
decision
is
far
broader
than
just
the
geographic
scope.
i
see
it
as
relating
to
a
court
deciding
that
certain
purposes
are
unapproved
or
be
it
for
a
certain
geographical
area
to
talk
about
certain
things
in
and
i
think
the
notion
of
privacy
here
is
extremely
dangerous.
