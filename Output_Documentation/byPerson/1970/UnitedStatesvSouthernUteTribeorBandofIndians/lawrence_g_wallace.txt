mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
asked
the
court
to
review
this
case
because
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
was
inconsistent
with
and
threatened
to
undermine
clearly
and
repeatedly
expressed
the
congressional
policies
regarding
the
jurisdiction
and
the
business
of
the
indian
claims
commission.
from
the
outset,
congress
has
imposed
explicit
limitations
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
and
has
specified
that
it
is
a
temporary
tribunal
whose
business
is
to
be
completed
within
a
fixed
period
of
years.
it
was
originally
established
with
a
life
span
of
10
years
and
legislation
enacted
in
1946
and
in
a
course
of
three,
five-year
extensions
of
the
life
of
the
commission,
congress
has
shown
increasing
impatience
to
see
the
commission’s
business
concluded.
we
express
this
legislative
history
in
our
brief
and
the
current
state
of
the
commission’s
business
indicates
that
it
is
unlikely
that,
that
business
will
be
concluded
when
the
present
life
of
the
commission
expires
in
april
of
1972
but
we
feel
in
light
of
the
congressional
policies
expressed,
we
are
oblige
to
try
to
see
that,
that
business
is
expedited.
we
reproduced
on
page
12
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
some
statistics
about
the
present
state
of
the
commission’s
business.
at
the
time
we
filed
the
petition
in
august
1970,
158
commission
cases
had
proceeded
to
judgment
at
which
81
in
addition
to
the
present
of
case
had
been
settled
by
compromise,
and
a
159
cases
remained
to
be
disposed
of.
there
has,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
been
a
changed
in
the
status
of
only
two
cases
in
the
intervening
months,
so
that
now
160
of
the
cases
have
proceeded
to
judgment
and
157
remained
to
be
disposed
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
are
attempting
in
this
case
to
enable
the
commission’s
business
to
be
concluded
in
accordance
with
this
congressional
policy
by
asking
this
court
to
review
and
the
court
agreed
to
review
the
court
of
claims
decision
which
seemed
to
ask
to
undermine,
to
jeopardize
this
congressional
policy
in
two
ways,
mr.
justice.
one
is
that
it
seemed
to
us
to
impair
the
finality
of
the
judgment’s
which
have
been
arrived
at
in
these
cases
particularly
the
judgment’s
arrived
at
through
the
process
of
settlement
and
compromise.
we
believe
the
court
of
claims
failed
to
properly
respect
the
principles
of
res
judicata
in
this
case.
and
the
second
way
in
which
this
decision
seemed
to
us
to
jeopardize
these
congressional
policies
was
by
impermissibly
expanding
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
beyond
the
statutory
cut-off
dates
that
congress
imposed
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction.
and
if
i
may,
i’ll
proceed
first
to
the
res
judicata
issue
in
the
case
because
under
our
view
of
the
case
that
issue
should
be
dispositive
of
the
case
in
this
court.
now,
there’s
a
lengthy
background,
historical
background
which
i
think
need
not
be
reviewed
in
detail,
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
map
to
each
of
the
justices
which
may
illuminate
a
little
bit
just
what
we’re
talking
about
here
relative
to
the
res
judicata
issue.
much
of
the
history
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
a
decision
in
volume
330
u.s.
written
by
mr.
justice
black
called
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
against
the
united
states.
it’s
330
u.s.
169.
it
was
there
noted
that
in
1868,
a
reservation
was
established
by
treaty
arrangement
with
confederated
bands
of
utes
which
included
all
of
the
ute
indians
and
that
reservation
was
the
entire
large
rectangular
area
on
this
map
bordered
in
red
and
also
in
orange
at
one
point.
and
the
treaty
specified
that
any
change
in
the
reservation
must
be
approved
by
three
quarters
of
the
males
of
the
entire
confederated
bands
of
utes.
the
first
change
that
took
place
was
in
1874,
the
so-called
brunot
cession
which
is
not
in
dispute
in
the
present
case
and
that
ceded
to
the
united
states
the
area,
the
rectangular
area
marked
off
in
yellow-orange
crayon
in
our
map.
and
remaining
after
the
brunot
cession
which
was
approved
by
three
quarters
of
the
males
of
the
entire
confederated
bands
was
the
rest
of
the
reservation
which
was
all
one
undifferentiated
ute
reservation
at
the
time
as
it
had
been
under
the
1868
legislation.
the
map
that
we
have
used
includes
numbers
on
it
so-called
royce
numbers
which
were
later
applied
by
charles
royce
who
drew
up
this
map.
this
is
a
copy
of
charles
royce’s
map
drawn
in
1896
but
at
the
time,
there
was
no
such
thing
as
royce
areas
there
was
only
the
one
undifferentiated
ute
reservation.
then
by
an
agreement
reached
in
1880
as
a
result
of
the
massacre
which
occurred
at
the
meeker
agency
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
reservation
and
this
too
was
reviewed
in
this
court’s
previous
case.
there
was
in
effect
a
forced
sale
of
this
entire
reservation
to
the
united
states
and
the
language
of
the
1880
agreement
ceded
the
reservation
to
the
united
states.
we
have
it
reproduced
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
the
legislation
which
is
found
in
volume
21
of
the
statutes.
it
was
an
agreement
between
the
confederated
bands
of
utes
which
include
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
the
united
states.
and
on
page
44
of
our
brief,
we
find
the
relevant
language
of
the
chiefs
and
headmen,
i'm
reading
the
last
full
paragraph
now
of
the
confederated
bands,
agree
to
use
their
best
efforts
to
procure
the
consent,
had
to
be
consent
of
three
quarters
of
the
males
to
cede
to
the
united
states
all
the
territory
of
the
present
ute
reservation
in
colorado
with
the
exception
of
provisions
for
settlement
by
individual
indians
in
severalty
and
in
the
case
of
the
utes
in
the
southern
portion
that
settlement
was
to
be
made
along
the
la
plata
river
in
colorado
which
is
the
area
shaded
in
green
on
our
map
and
if
there
was
insufficient
land
there
for
the
allotments
in
severalty
to
the
individual
indians
then
they
were
to
be
settled
under
the
la
plate
river
and
it's
vicinity
in
new
mexico.
that
language
is
right
at
the
bottom
of
page
44
of
the
statute
and
repeatedly
the
statute
refers
to
this
proviso
all
to
the
session
of
all
of
the
lands
as
a
proviso
for
allotments
in
severalty.
that
language
is
used
on
page
45
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
paragraph
allotments
and
severalty
of
said
lands
and
at
the
very
bottom
of
that
page
the
land
that
should
be
divided
among
the
said
indians
in
severalty,
and
again
at
the
bottom
of
page
46
that
the
reference
to
settlement
in
severalty.
and
accordingly,
in
this
court’s
previous
decision
dealing
with
the
treaty
at
page
174
of
volume
330
of
the
u.s.
reports
after
the
relevant
language
of
the
treaty
as
quoted,
this
court
said
quite
succinctly,
“this
act
authorize
specific
allotments
to
individual
indians
from
the
lands
so
ceded.”
the
court
referred
to
this
as
the
land
ceded.
all
of
the
lands
of
then
present
reservation.
the
dominant
intent
of
those
who
sponsored
this
legislation
and
this
treaty
was
to
extinguish
reservation
life
for
the
ute
indians.
this
is
clear
from
the
reports
and
from
the
legislative
history
which
we
cite
extensively
in
our
brief.
this
was
partly
for
retaliatory
reasons
of
the
massacre
and
partly
it
represented
prevalence
of
the
view
that
many
held
at
the
time
that
it
was
wasteful
of
land
to
try
to
maintain
the
indians
in
their
aboriginal
state
that
they
should
be
settled
on
homestead
size
plots
to
be
farmers.
views
were
expressed
by
some
who
opposed
the
legislation
that
the
indians
weren’t
ready
for
this
kind
of
settlement
but
those
views
did
not
prevail.
the
act
was
enacted
and
the
agreement
was
duly
ratified
by
the
ute
indians,
by
the
confederated
band
which
included
the
respondent.
there
were
subsequently
legislation
which
was
not
referred
to
in
the
course
of
the
settlement
agreement
in
1950
in
which
we
rely
and
which
i
will
refer
to
just
briefly
in
the
historical
part
of
our
brief.
we
refer
to
the
subsequent
legislation
at
some
length.
the
1882
act
was
a
very
short
statute
which
provided
for
the
first
time
for
the
line
to
be
surveyed
which
appears
as
the
dotted
line
on
our
map.
this
was
necessary
because
all
of
the
utes
in
the
northern
part
of
the
ceded
reservation
had
been
removed
to
utah
and
therefore
that
part
of
the
reservation
was
ready
for
settlement
by
non-indians.
but
the
allotments
had
not
yet
been
made
to
the
utes
in
the
southern
portion
the
so-called
southern
utes
including
the
respondents
and
the
settlement
could
not
be
made
by
the
non-indians
until
after
the
individual
allotments
had
been
made
and
therefore
it
was
necessary
to
survey
a
line
to
cutoff
the
southern
portion
so
that
the
northern
portion
could
be
open
to
non-indian
settlement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
indians
were
still
in
the
entire
southern
area.
they
had
not
yet
been
settled
along
the
la
plata
valley.
the
southern
area
therefore
was
not
a
practical
matter
ready
for
settlement
by
the
white
settlers
and
that
was
why
congress
said
that
this
line
should
be
drawn
so
that
the
northern
part
could
be
opened
for
settlements
for
homesteading
and
for
sales.
in
the
1895
legislation
which
then
ensued
the
house
report
which
we
quote
on
page
9
of
our
brief
refer
to
the
southern
indians
“anomalous
condition
of
having
ceded
their
reservation”
that
was
the
word
used
“having
ceded
their
reservation
and
yet
remaining
upon
it.”
and
for
that
reason
congress
decided
that
a
reservation
should
be
restored
to
the
southern
utes
and
for
the
first
time
a
southern
ute
reservation
was
established
by
the
act
of
1895
which
we
refer
to
and
reproduce
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
now
be
the
lengthy,
the
long,
narrow
rectangle
at
the
bottom
that
would
be
formed
by
extending
the
dotted
line
to
the
western
boundary
of
colorado.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
well,
it
was
actually
the
left
the
corner
of
it.
that
was
established
as
a
reservation
for
the
southern
utes
by
the
act
of
1895
which
is
reproduced
starting
on
page
48
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
left
corner
of
this
southern
part
and
the
remainder
of
this
southern
strip
was
allotted
in
severalty
to
individual
indians.
but
a
reservation
was
established
to
that
time
not
in
the
entire
southern
strip
but
in
the
left
portion
of
the
western
portion
of
it.
part
of
it
was
allotted
in
severalty
as
the
act
of
1880
had
provided,
part
of
it
was
established
for
the
first
time
as
a
southern
ute
reservation.
there
was
no
southern
ute
reservation
as
such
as
we
read
the
statute
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
as
we
think
this
court
read
the
statutes
in
the
case
that
i’ve
cited
to
you.
now
this
is
of
significance
because
of
the
settlement
agreement
of
that
we
think
of
the
court
of
claims
should
have
honored
in
our
plea
of
res
judicata
in
this
case.
that
settlement
agreement
which
was
formalized
in
the
court
of
claims
judgment
was
added
into
in
1950
the
relevant
portions
of
it
are
set
forth
on
pages
98
and
99
of
the
appendix.
in
these
excerpts,
these
indented
excerpts
that
appear
in
judge
skelton’s
dissenting
opinion
on
the
court
of
claims.
the
judgment
entered
was
entered,
you
notice
in
the
first
excerpt
has
full
settlement
in
payment
for
the
complete
extinguishment
of
plaintiffs’
right,
title,
interest,
estate,
claims,
and
demands
of
whatsoever
in
nature
to
the
land
ceded
by
the
plaintiffs
to
the
defendant
by
the
act
of
1880
and
after
a
schedule
of
lands
was
included
in
the
settlement
agreement
the
portion
on
page
99
says
that
the
judgment
is
res
judicata
not
only
as
to
the
land
described
in
this
settlement
but
whether
included
there
in
or
not
also
as
to
any
land
formerly
owned
or
claim
by
the
plaintiffs
in
western
colorado
ceded
to
defendant
by
the
act
of
june
15,
1880.
now
the
respondents
were
parties
to
that
settlement
agreement
and
the
four
cases
that
were
settled
in
that
judgment
after
several
years
of
negotiation
and
compromise
between
the
government
and
the
present
counsel
for
the
respondents.
the
confederated
bands
of
utes
including
the
southern
utes
were
awarded
almost
$32
million
in
settlement.
judge
skelton
estimates
that
this
amounted
to
$15,600.00
per
individual
indian
not
for
family
but
for
individual.
the
settlement
provided
pursuant
to
stipulation
of
the
tribes
that
40%
of
the
award
would
go
to
the
southern
utes
including
the
respondents
and
this
is
a
recited
in
section
672
of
title
25
of
the
united
states
code.
it
seems
significant
to
us
that
although
the
respondents
now
claimed
that
no
southern
ute
lands
were
involved
in
that
settlement.
their
percentage
of
the
award
that’s
40%
was
larger
than
the
one
third
which
was
specified
in
the
1880
agreement
in
legislation
as
the
share
that
the
southern
utes
were
to
take
in
proceeds
under
that
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
not
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
settlement
agreement
recited
very
specifically
and
this
is
at
page
43
of
volume
117
in
the
court
of
claims
“such
judgment
shall
be
final
adjudication
of
all
issues
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendant
in
the
case.”
it
recited
this,
as
to
each
of
the
settlements,
i’m
quoting
the
one
that’s
directly
relevant
here,
appears
on
438
of
volume
117.
but
also
of
great
significance
in
our
view
is
the
context
in
which
this
settlement
and
judgment
were
reached,
the
context
of
contemporaneous
litigation
in
this
court
between
the
same
parties
represented
by
the
same
counsel.
on
pages
11
and
12
of
our
brief,
we
cite
a
council
for
the
utes
repeated
an
emphatic
representations
in
that
case,
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
briefs
and
the
case
that's
in
volume
330
u.s.
that
the
1880
agreement
had
ceded
to
the
government
all
of
the
consolidated
bands,
colorado
lands
except
for
the
individual
allotments
in
severalty
which
were
provided
for.
and
is
noted
in
our
brief,
this
was
also
the
view
taken
in
previous
court
of
claims
cases
and
the
government
in
it's
brief
in
that
case
in
this
court
acknowledged
the
correctness
of
this
representation.
moreover,
this
court
in
language
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
on
page
25
of
our
brief
and
i
think
this
is
very
significant,
this
court
specifically
referred
to
the
then
pending
court
of
claims
litigation
which
reached
settlement
three
years
later
in
1950
and
said
in
the
language
that
we
quote
there
in
the
middle
of
page
25
of
our
brief,
“except
for
13
treaty
lands
not
at
issue
here,
litigation
concerning
which
is
now
pending
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
only
lands
in
colorado
for
which
the
indians
have
not
been
paid
are
those
to
the
north
of
an
outside
the
1868
treaty
reservation.”
and
the
court
in
that
case
this
case
rejected
their
claim
for
payment
for
those
lands
that
were
north
of
the
treaty
reservation,
the
original
treaty.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
it
is
considered
that
petitioners,
the
confederated
utes
including
the
respondents
have
either
been
or
are
currently
pressing
litigation
in
the
court
of
claims
by
which
they
seek
to
be
compensated
for
the
white
river
valley
lands
and
in
fact
for
all
of
the
land
which
was
contained
in
the
true
boundaries
of
the
1868
reservation
and
that
is
the
entire
large
rectangle
on
the
map
which
of
course
includes
the
lands
in
the
southern
strip
for
which
the
court
of
claims
upheld
in
additional
reward
in
this
case.
now
we
emphasize
this
language,
we
believe
that
was
correct
but
we
emphasized
this
language
not
because
there’s
no
possibility
that
this
court
could
have
been
an
error
in
saying
this
but
because
this
language
was
based
on
representations
of
the
same
counsel
who
then
negotiated
the
settlement
agreement.
they
were
aware
of
what
this
court
had
held
and
had
said
in
the
case
1947,
and
it
seems
inconceivable
to
us
at
least
that
counsel,
aware
that
the
court
had
said
this
about
the
litigation
then
pending,
would
enter
into
a
settlement
agreement
using
this
broad
language
referring
to
all
of
the
lands
ceded
in
1880
act
without
reservation
of
any
other
claims,
a
settlement
which
recite
that
it’s
a
final
adjudication
of
everything
that
was
of
issue
in
those
cases.
it
seems
inconceivable
to
us
that
counsel
would
enter
into
such
a
settlement
agreement
using
that
language
in
the
context
of
this
court’s
recent
opinion
if
they
had
mend
to
reserve
further
claims
to
the
southern
lands.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
of
course
point
to
statements
that
were
previously
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
by
the
other
officials
in
the
interior
department
the
latest
of
which
were
in
1938
in
which
in
our
view
there
were
some
confusion
as
to
what
was
established
by
the
1880
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
frankly,
i
don’t
see
language.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
and
that
is
what
--
that
embrace
all
of
the
land
of
their
reservation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
they
make
some
arguments
about
it
but
frankly
i
don’t
see
that
any
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
the
majority
of
the
court
of
claims
entertained
parol
evidence
on
the
question
of
the
parties
intent
and
took
the
government
severely
the
task
because
we
raised
the
claim
of
executive
privilege
with
respect
to
the
attorneys
work
product
of
the
attorney
who
negotiated
the
settlement
with
the
respondents
who
wanted
to
refer
to
his
notes
and
work
product
who
is
no
longer
in
the
government
but
really
the
claim
of
executive
privilege
was
in
our
view
essentially
is
the
purpose,
our
basic
position
was
it
that
this
was
not
a
situation
that
admitted
of
parol
evidence
as
to
the
intention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
then
there
would
be
an
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
to
whether
the
claim
of
the
executive
privilege
was
a
proper
one
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
resolution
of
the
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
their
claim
is
that
we
had
treated
the
1880
act
right
along
as
reserving
a
reservation
for
the
southern
utes
even
though
it
did
not
in
terms
reserve
anything
but
individual
allotments
and
it
was
not
until
the
1895
act
that
anything
can
be
found
in
the
statute
books
which
indicates
the
statutes
of
a
reservation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
my
answer
is
these
even
though
clauses,
there
had
been
some
misunderstanding
by
some
interior
department
officials
as
to
the
effect
of
the
1880
act,
the
effect
of
the
1895
act
but
always
in
a
context
in
which
it
was
a
immaterial
whether
the
reservation
was
established
by
the
one
or
the
other
and
these
matters,
these
expressions
of
confusion
which
are
cited
and
we
refer
them
in
our
reply
brief
were
remote
in
time
from
unsettlement
negotiations
that
were
being
conducted
in
1947
through
1950
in
the
context
of
what
counsel,
the
very
same
counsel
had
said
to
this
court
and
what
this
court
had
said
which
indicate
completely
in
our
view
that
the
1950
settlement
covered
all
of
the
lands
within
this
large
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
latest
expression
was
in
the
restoration
of
1938.
there
was
also
an
expression
in
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
seemed
to
us
clear
from
the
context,
the
attorneys
who
has
just
litigated
this
case
in
this
court
and
we
are
aware
of
the
language
this
court
had
use
if
they
entered
into
a
sweeping
a
settlement
agreement
as
they
did,
it
seems
to
us
the
way
any
other
judgment
is
treated
they
obviously
meant
to
settle
all
the
claims
that
were
at
issue.
that
would
certainly
be
the
view
on
an
antitrust
consent
to
create
any
other
settlement
judgment
and
we
don’t
think
that
this
judgment
which
was
the
result
of
a
compromise
negotiated
by
very
able
counsel
over
a
period
of
several
years
should
be
treated
any
differently.
now,
we
also
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
to
be
in
a
valued
in
further
proceedings
mr.
justice
that
the
claim
is
just
for
evaluation
of
an
accounting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t’
think
the
record
really
indicates
it
and
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that,
this
remains
to
be
evaluated.
there
is
of
course
an
additional
issue
as
to
the
extent
of
the
accounting
that’s
properly
required
under
the
judgment
in
this
case.
should
the
court
disagree
with
us
under
res
judicata
issue,
we’ve
developed
that
in
our
brief
it
seemed
to
us
that
they
both,
the
commission
the
court
of
claims
when
way
beyond
the
explicit
cut-off
dates
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
in
accepting
10
years
after
the
accounting
was
rendered
exceptions
which
brings
in
to
issue
claims
other
than
those
made
during
the
statutory
limitations
period
in
which
would
require
a
general
accounting
up
to
date
which
seemed
us
to
go
way
beyond
the
statutory
limitations
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
res
judicata
point
that
we’re
making
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
just
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
want
to
call
specific
attention
to
page
8
of
our
reply
brief
that
we
filed
in
this
court
in
which
we
quote
from
the
brief
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
confederated
utes
in
this
court
in
1947
including
the
respondents.
our
reply
brief
was
filed
in
february
1971.
it’s
on
the
front
cover
it
says
petitioner’s
reply
brief.
on
page
8
of
that
reply
brief
we
quote
from
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
mr.
wilkinson,
mr.
ernest
wilkinson,
mr.
glen
wilkinson’s
law
partner,
in
this
court
in
1946
term
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
previously
and
that
brief
said
that
the
central
purpose
of
the
1880
act
was
“to
acquire
all
of
the
land
of
the
then
present
ute
reservation”
and
the
sole
“exceptions”
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
is
a
misprint,
i’m
sorry.
the
word
should
be
“sole”
and
the
sole
exceptions
were
unoccupied
agricultural
lands
on
the
la
plata
river,
agricultural
lands
on
grand
river,
etcetera
for
individual
allotments.
that
is
the
representation
that
the
ute
band
made
at
this
time.
they’re
now
claiming
that
that
reservation
in
the
1880
act
was
for
a
reservation
for
the
southern
ute
tribe
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
light
of
what
they
had
said
in
the
1947
litigation
and
what
this
court
had
said
that
the
stipulation
in
1950
would
have
read
quite
differently
if
they
had
meant
to
reserve
southern
ute
lands
from
that
settlement.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
asked
the
court
to
review
this
case
because
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
was
inconsistent
with
and
threatened
to
undermine
clearly
and
repeatedly
expressed
the
congressional
policies
regarding
the
jurisdiction
and
the
business
of
the
indian
claims
commission.
from
the
outset,
congress
has
imposed
explicit
limitations
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
and
has
specified
that
it
is
a
temporary
tribunal
whose
business
is
to
be
completed
within
a
fixed
period
of
years.
it
was
originally
established
with
a
life
span
of
10
years
and
legislation
enacted
in
1946
and
in
a
course
of
three,
five-year
extensions
of
the
life
of
the
commission,
congress
has
shown
increasing
impatience
to
see
the
commission’s
business
concluded.
we
express
this
legislative
history
in
our
brief
and
the
current
state
of
the
commission’s
business
indicates
that
it
is
unlikely
that,
that
business
will
be
concluded
when
the
present
life
of
the
commission
expires
in
april
of
1972
but
we
feel
in
light
of
the
congressional
policies
expressed,
we
are
oblige
to
try
to
see
that,
that
business
is
expedited.
we
reproduced
on
page
12
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
some
statistics
about
the
present
state
of
the
commission’s
business.
at
the
time
we
filed
the
petition
in
august
1970,
158
commission
cases
had
proceeded
to
judgment
at
which
81
in
addition
to
the
present
of
case
had
been
settled
by
compromise,
and
a
159
cases
remained
to
be
disposed
of.
there
has,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
been
a
changed
in
the
status
of
only
two
cases
in
the
intervening
months,
so
that
now
160
of
the
cases
have
proceeded
to
judgment
and
157
remained
to
be
disposed
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
are
attempting
in
this
case
to
enable
the
commission’s
business
to
be
concluded
in
accordance
with
this
congressional
policy
by
asking
this
court
to
review
and
the
court
agreed
to
review
the
court
of
claims
decision
which
seemed
to
ask
to
undermine,
to
jeopardize
this
congressional
policy
in
two
ways,
mr.
justice.
one
is
that
it
seemed
to
us
to
impair
the
finality
of
the
judgment’s
which
have
been
arrived
at
in
these
cases
particularly
the
judgment’s
arrived
at
through
the
process
of
settlement
and
compromise.
we
believe
the
court
of
claims
failed
to
properly
respect
the
principles
of
res
judicata
in
this
case.
and
the
second
way
in
which
this
decision
seemed
to
us
to
jeopardize
these
congressional
policies
was
by
impermissibly
expanding
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
beyond
the
statutory
cut-off
dates
that
congress
imposed
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction.
and
if
i
may,
i’ll
proceed
first
to
the
res
judicata
issue
in
the
case
because
under
our
view
of
the
case
that
issue
should
be
dispositive
of
the
case
in
this
court.
now,
there’s
a
lengthy
background,
historical
background
which
i
think
need
not
be
reviewed
in
detail,
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
map
to
each
of
the
justices
which
may
illuminate
a
little
bit
just
what
we’re
talking
about
here
relative
to
the
res
judicata
issue.
much
of
the
history
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
a
decision
in
volume
330
u.s.
written
by
mr.
justice
black
called
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
against
the
united
states.
it’s
330
u.s.
169.
it
was
there
noted
that
in
1868,
a
reservation
was
established
by
treaty
arrangement
with
confederated
bands
of
utes
which
included
all
of
the
ute
indians
and
that
reservation
was
the
entire
large
rectangular
area
on
this
map
bordered
in
red
and
also
in
orange
at
one
point.
and
the
treaty
specified
that
any
change
in
the
reservation
must
be
approved
by
three
quarters
of
the
males
of
the
entire
confederated
bands
of
utes.
the
first
change
that
took
place
was
in
1874,
the
so-called
brunot
cession
which
is
not
in
dispute
in
the
present
case
and
that
ceded
to
the
united
states
the
area,
the
rectangular
area
marked
off
in
yellow-orange
crayon
in
our
map.
and
remaining
after
the
brunot
cession
which
was
approved
by
three
quarters
of
the
males
of
the
entire
confederated
bands
was
the
rest
of
the
reservation
which
was
all
one
undifferentiated
ute
reservation
at
the
time
as
it
had
been
under
the
1868
legislation.
the
map
that
we
have
used
includes
numbers
on
it
so-called
royce
numbers
which
were
later
applied
by
charles
royce
who
drew
up
this
map.
this
is
a
copy
of
charles
royce’s
map
drawn
in
1896
but
at
the
time,
there
was
no
such
thing
as
royce
areas
there
was
only
the
one
undifferentiated
ute
reservation.
then
by
an
agreement
reached
in
1880
as
a
result
of
the
massacre
which
occurred
at
the
meeker
agency
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
reservation
and
this
too
was
reviewed
in
this
court’s
previous
case.
there
was
in
effect
a
forced
sale
of
this
entire
reservation
to
the
united
states
and
the
language
of
the
1880
agreement
ceded
the
reservation
to
the
united
states.
we
have
it
reproduced
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
the
legislation
which
is
found
in
volume
21
of
the
statutes.
it
was
an
agreement
between
the
confederated
bands
of
utes
which
include
the
respondents
in
this
case
and
the
united
states.
and
on
page
44
of
our
brief,
we
find
the
relevant
language
of
the
chiefs
and
headmen,
i'm
reading
the
last
full
paragraph
now
of
the
confederated
bands,
agree
to
use
their
best
efforts
to
procure
the
consent,
had
to
be
consent
of
three
quarters
of
the
males
to
cede
to
the
united
states
all
the
territory
of
the
present
ute
reservation
in
colorado
with
the
exception
of
provisions
for
settlement
by
individual
indians
in
severalty
and
in
the
case
of
the
utes
in
the
southern
portion
that
settlement
was
to
be
made
along
the
la
plata
river
in
colorado
which
is
the
area
shaded
in
green
on
our
map
and
if
there
was
insufficient
land
there
for
the
allotments
in
severalty
to
the
individual
indians
then
they
were
to
be
settled
under
the
la
plate
river
and
it's
vicinity
in
new
mexico.
that
language
is
right
at
the
bottom
of
page
44
of
the
statute
and
repeatedly
the
statute
refers
to
this
proviso
all
to
the
session
of
all
of
the
lands
as
a
proviso
for
allotments
in
severalty.
that
language
is
used
on
page
45
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
paragraph
allotments
and
severalty
of
said
lands
and
at
the
very
bottom
of
that
page
the
land
that
should
be
divided
among
the
said
indians
in
severalty,
and
again
at
the
bottom
of
page
46
that
the
reference
to
settlement
in
severalty.
and
accordingly,
in
this
court’s
previous
decision
dealing
with
the
treaty
at
page
174
of
volume
330
of
the
u.s.
reports
after
the
relevant
language
of
the
treaty
as
quoted,
this
court
said
quite
succinctly,
“this
act
authorize
specific
allotments
to
individual
indians
from
the
lands
so
ceded.”
the
court
referred
to
this
as
the
land
ceded.
all
of
the
lands
of
then
present
reservation.
the
dominant
intent
of
those
who
sponsored
this
legislation
and
this
treaty
was
to
extinguish
reservation
life
for
the
ute
indians.
this
is
clear
from
the
reports
and
from
the
legislative
history
which
we
cite
extensively
in
our
brief.
this
was
partly
for
retaliatory
reasons
of
the
massacre
and
partly
it
represented
prevalence
of
the
view
that
many
held
at
the
time
that
it
was
wasteful
of
land
to
try
to
maintain
the
indians
in
their
aboriginal
state
that
they
should
be
settled
on
homestead
size
plots
to
be
farmers.
views
were
expressed
by
some
who
opposed
the
legislation
that
the
indians
weren’t
ready
for
this
kind
of
settlement
but
those
views
did
not
prevail.
the
act
was
enacted
and
the
agreement
was
duly
ratified
by
the
ute
indians,
by
the
confederated
band
which
included
the
respondent.
there
were
subsequently
legislation
which
was
not
referred
to
in
the
course
of
the
settlement
agreement
in
1950
in
which
we
rely
and
which
i
will
refer
to
just
briefly
in
the
historical
part
of
our
brief.
we
refer
to
the
subsequent
legislation
at
some
length.
the
1882
act
was
a
very
short
statute
which
provided
for
the
first
time
for
the
line
to
be
surveyed
which
appears
as
the
dotted
line
on
our
map.
this
was
necessary
because
all
of
the
utes
in
the
northern
part
of
the
ceded
reservation
had
been
removed
to
utah
and
therefore
that
part
of
the
reservation
was
ready
for
settlement
by
non-indians.
but
the
allotments
had
not
yet
been
made
to
the
utes
in
the
southern
portion
the
so-called
southern
utes
including
the
respondents
and
the
settlement
could
not
be
made
by
the
non-indians
until
after
the
individual
allotments
had
been
made
and
therefore
it
was
necessary
to
survey
a
line
to
cutoff
the
southern
portion
so
that
the
northern
portion
could
be
open
to
non-indian
settlement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
indians
were
still
in
the
entire
southern
area.
they
had
not
yet
been
settled
along
the
la
plata
valley.
the
southern
area
therefore
was
not
a
practical
matter
ready
for
settlement
by
the
white
settlers
and
that
was
why
congress
said
that
this
line
should
be
drawn
so
that
the
northern
part
could
be
opened
for
settlements
for
homesteading
and
for
sales.
in
the
1895
legislation
which
then
ensued
the
house
report
which
we
quote
on
page
9
of
our
brief
refer
to
the
southern
indians
“anomalous
condition
of
having
ceded
their
reservation”
that
was
the
word
used
“having
ceded
their
reservation
and
yet
remaining
upon
it.”
and
for
that
reason
congress
decided
that
a
reservation
should
be
restored
to
the
southern
utes
and
for
the
first
time
a
southern
ute
reservation
was
established
by
the
act
of
1895
which
we
refer
to
and
reproduce
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
now
be
the
lengthy,
the
long,
narrow
rectangle
at
the
bottom
that
would
be
formed
by
extending
the
dotted
line
to
the
western
boundary
of
colorado.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
well,
it
was
actually
the
left
the
corner
of
it.
that
was
established
as
a
reservation
for
the
southern
utes
by
the
act
of
1895
which
is
reproduced
starting
on
page
48
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
left
corner
of
this
southern
part
and
the
remainder
of
this
southern
strip
was
allotted
in
severalty
to
individual
indians.
but
a
reservation
was
established
to
that
time
not
in
the
entire
southern
strip
but
in
the
left
portion
of
the
western
portion
of
it.
part
of
it
was
allotted
in
severalty
as
the
act
of
1880
had
provided,
part
of
it
was
established
for
the
first
time
as
a
southern
ute
reservation.
there
was
no
southern
ute
reservation
as
such
as
we
read
the
statute
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
as
we
think
this
court
read
the
statutes
in
the
case
that
i’ve
cited
to
you.
now
this
is
of
significance
because
of
the
settlement
agreement
of
that
we
think
of
the
court
of
claims
should
have
honored
in
our
plea
of
res
judicata
in
this
case.
that
settlement
agreement
which
was
formalized
in
the
court
of
claims
judgment
was
added
into
in
1950
the
relevant
portions
of
it
are
set
forth
on
pages
98
and
99
of
the
appendix.
in
these
excerpts,
these
indented
excerpts
that
appear
in
judge
skelton’s
dissenting
opinion
on
the
court
of
claims.
the
judgment
entered
was
entered,
you
notice
in
the
first
excerpt
has
full
settlement
in
payment
for
the
complete
extinguishment
of
plaintiffs’
right,
title,
interest,
estate,
claims,
and
demands
of
whatsoever
in
nature
to
the
land
ceded
by
the
plaintiffs
to
the
defendant
by
the
act
of
1880
and
after
a
schedule
of
lands
was
included
in
the
settlement
agreement
the
portion
on
page
99
says
that
the
judgment
is
res
judicata
not
only
as
to
the
land
described
in
this
settlement
but
whether
included
there
in
or
not
also
as
to
any
land
formerly
owned
or
claim
by
the
plaintiffs
in
western
colorado
ceded
to
defendant
by
the
act
of
june
15,
1880.
now
the
respondents
were
parties
to
that
settlement
agreement
and
the
four
cases
that
were
settled
in
that
judgment
after
several
years
of
negotiation
and
compromise
between
the
government
and
the
present
counsel
for
the
respondents.
the
confederated
bands
of
utes
including
the
southern
utes
were
awarded
almost
$32
million
in
settlement.
judge
skelton
estimates
that
this
amounted
to
$15,600.00
per
individual
indian
not
for
family
but
for
individual.
the
settlement
provided
pursuant
to
stipulation
of
the
tribes
that
40%
of
the
award
would
go
to
the
southern
utes
including
the
respondents
and
this
is
a
recited
in
section
672
of
title
25
of
the
united
states
code.
it
seems
significant
to
us
that
although
the
respondents
now
claimed
that
no
southern
ute
lands
were
involved
in
that
settlement.
their
percentage
of
the
award
that’s
40%
was
larger
than
the
one
third
which
was
specified
in
the
1880
agreement
in
legislation
as
the
share
that
the
southern
utes
were
to
take
in
proceeds
under
that
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
were
not
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
settlement
agreement
recited
very
specifically
and
this
is
at
page
43
of
volume
117
in
the
court
of
claims
“such
judgment
shall
be
final
adjudication
of
all
issues
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendant
in
the
case.”
it
recited
this,
as
to
each
of
the
settlements,
i’m
quoting
the
one
that’s
directly
relevant
here,
appears
on
438
of
volume
117.
but
also
of
great
significance
in
our
view
is
the
context
in
which
this
settlement
and
judgment
were
reached,
the
context
of
contemporaneous
litigation
in
this
court
between
the
same
parties
represented
by
the
same
counsel.
on
pages
11
and
12
of
our
brief,
we
cite
a
council
for
the
utes
repeated
an
emphatic
representations
in
that
case,
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
briefs
and
the
case
that's
in
volume
330
u.s.
that
the
1880
agreement
had
ceded
to
the
government
all
of
the
consolidated
bands,
colorado
lands
except
for
the
individual
allotments
in
severalty
which
were
provided
for.
and
is
noted
in
our
brief,
this
was
also
the
view
taken
in
previous
court
of
claims
cases
and
the
government
in
it's
brief
in
that
case
in
this
court
acknowledged
the
correctness
of
this
representation.
moreover,
this
court
in
language
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
on
page
25
of
our
brief
and
i
think
this
is
very
significant,
this
court
specifically
referred
to
the
then
pending
court
of
claims
litigation
which
reached
settlement
three
years
later
in
1950
and
said
in
the
language
that
we
quote
there
in
the
middle
of
page
25
of
our
brief,
“except
for
13
treaty
lands
not
at
issue
here,
litigation
concerning
which
is
now
pending
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
only
lands
in
colorado
for
which
the
indians
have
not
been
paid
are
those
to
the
north
of
an
outside
the
1868
treaty
reservation.”
and
the
court
in
that
case
this
case
rejected
their
claim
for
payment
for
those
lands
that
were
north
of
the
treaty
reservation,
the
original
treaty.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
it
is
considered
that
petitioners,
the
confederated
utes
including
the
respondents
have
either
been
or
are
currently
pressing
litigation
in
the
court
of
claims
by
which
they
seek
to
be
compensated
for
the
white
river
valley
lands
and
in
fact
for
all
of
the
land
which
was
contained
in
the
true
boundaries
of
the
1868
reservation
and
that
is
the
entire
large
rectangle
on
the
map
which
of
course
includes
the
lands
in
the
southern
strip
for
which
the
court
of
claims
upheld
in
additional
reward
in
this
case.
now
we
emphasize
this
language,
we
believe
that
was
correct
but
we
emphasized
this
language
not
because
there’s
no
possibility
that
this
court
could
have
been
an
error
in
saying
this
but
because
this
language
was
based
on
representations
of
the
same
counsel
who
then
negotiated
the
settlement
agreement.
they
were
aware
of
what
this
court
had
held
and
had
said
in
the
case
1947,
and
it
seems
inconceivable
to
us
at
least
that
counsel,
aware
that
the
court
had
said
this
about
the
litigation
then
pending,
would
enter
into
a
settlement
agreement
using
this
broad
language
referring
to
all
of
the
lands
ceded
in
1880
act
without
reservation
of
any
other
claims,
a
settlement
which
recite
that
it’s
a
final
adjudication
of
everything
that
was
of
issue
in
those
cases.
it
seems
inconceivable
to
us
that
counsel
would
enter
into
such
a
settlement
agreement
using
that
language
in
the
context
of
this
court’s
recent
opinion
if
they
had
mend
to
reserve
further
claims
to
the
southern
lands.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
of
course
point
to
statements
that
were
previously
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
by
the
other
officials
in
the
interior
department
the
latest
of
which
were
in
1938
in
which
in
our
view
there
were
some
confusion
as
to
what
was
established
by
the
1880
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
frankly,
i
don’t
see
language.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
and
that
is
what
--
that
embrace
all
of
the
land
of
their
reservation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course
they
make
some
arguments
about
it
but
frankly
i
don’t
see
that
any
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
the
majority
of
the
court
of
claims
entertained
parol
evidence
on
the
question
of
the
parties
intent
and
took
the
government
severely
the
task
because
we
raised
the
claim
of
executive
privilege
with
respect
to
the
attorneys
work
product
of
the
attorney
who
negotiated
the
settlement
with
the
respondents
who
wanted
to
refer
to
his
notes
and
work
product
who
is
no
longer
in
the
government
but
really
the
claim
of
executive
privilege
was
in
our
view
essentially
is
the
purpose,
our
basic
position
was
it
that
this
was
not
a
situation
that
admitted
of
parol
evidence
as
to
the
intention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
then
there
would
be
an
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
to
whether
the
claim
of
the
executive
privilege
was
a
proper
one
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
resolution
of
the
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
their
claim
is
that
we
had
treated
the
1880
act
right
along
as
reserving
a
reservation
for
the
southern
utes
even
though
it
did
not
in
terms
reserve
anything
but
individual
allotments
and
it
was
not
until
the
1895
act
that
anything
can
be
found
in
the
statute
books
which
indicates
the
statutes
of
a
reservation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
my
answer
is
these
even
though
clauses,
there
had
been
some
misunderstanding
by
some
interior
department
officials
as
to
the
effect
of
the
1880
act,
the
effect
of
the
1895
act
but
always
in
a
context
in
which
it
was
a
immaterial
whether
the
reservation
was
established
by
the
one
or
the
other
and
these
matters,
these
expressions
of
confusion
which
are
cited
and
we
refer
them
in
our
reply
brief
were
remote
in
time
from
unsettlement
negotiations
that
were
being
conducted
in
1947
through
1950
in
the
context
of
what
counsel,
the
very
same
counsel
had
said
to
this
court
and
what
this
court
had
said
which
indicate
completely
in
our
view
that
the
1950
settlement
covered
all
of
the
lands
within
this
large
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
latest
expression
was
in
the
restoration
of
1938.
there
was
also
an
expression
in
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
seemed
to
us
clear
from
the
context,
the
attorneys
who
has
just
litigated
this
case
in
this
court
and
we
are
aware
of
the
language
this
court
had
use
if
they
entered
into
a
sweeping
a
settlement
agreement
as
they
did,
it
seems
to
us
the
way
any
other
judgment
is
treated
they
obviously
meant
to
settle
all
the
claims
that
were
at
issue.
that
would
certainly
be
the
view
on
an
antitrust
consent
to
create
any
other
settlement
judgment
and
we
don’t
think
that
this
judgment
which
was
the
result
of
a
compromise
negotiated
by
very
able
counsel
over
a
period
of
several
years
should
be
treated
any
differently.
now,
we
also
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
to
be
in
a
valued
in
further
proceedings
mr.
justice
that
the
claim
is
just
for
evaluation
of
an
accounting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t’
think
the
record
really
indicates
it
and
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that,
this
remains
to
be
evaluated.
there
is
of
course
an
additional
issue
as
to
the
extent
of
the
accounting
that’s
properly
required
under
the
judgment
in
this
case.
should
the
court
disagree
with
us
under
res
judicata
issue,
we’ve
developed
that
in
our
brief
it
seemed
to
us
that
they
both,
the
commission
the
court
of
claims
when
way
beyond
the
explicit
cut-off
dates
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
in
accepting
10
years
after
the
accounting
was
rendered
exceptions
which
brings
in
to
issue
claims
other
than
those
made
during
the
statutory
limitations
period
in
which
would
require
a
general
accounting
up
to
date
which
seemed
us
to
go
way
beyond
the
statutory
limitations
on
the
commission’s
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
res
judicata
point
that
we’re
making
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
just
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
want
to
call
specific
attention
to
page
8
of
our
reply
brief
that
we
filed
in
this
court
in
which
we
quote
from
the
brief
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
confederated
utes
in
this
court
in
1947
including
the
respondents.
our
reply
brief
was
filed
in
february
1971.
it’s
on
the
front
cover
it
says
petitioner’s
reply
brief.
on
page
8
of
that
reply
brief
we
quote
from
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
mr.
wilkinson,
mr.
ernest
wilkinson,
mr.
glen
wilkinson’s
law
partner,
in
this
court
in
1946
term
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
previously
and
that
brief
said
that
the
central
purpose
of
the
1880
act
was
“to
acquire
all
of
the
land
of
the
then
present
ute
reservation”
and
the
sole
“exceptions”
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
is
a
misprint,
i’m
sorry.
the
word
should
be
“sole”
and
the
sole
exceptions
were
unoccupied
agricultural
lands
on
the
la
plata
river,
agricultural
lands
on
grand
river,
etcetera
for
individual
allotments.
that
is
the
representation
that
the
ute
band
made
at
this
time.
they’re
now
claiming
that
that
reservation
in
the
1880
act
was
for
a
reservation
for
the
southern
ute
tribe
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
light
of
what
they
had
said
in
the
1947
litigation
and
what
this
court
had
said
that
the
stipulation
in
1950
would
have
read
quite
differently
if
they
had
meant
to
reserve
southern
ute
lands
from
that
settlement.
thank
you.
