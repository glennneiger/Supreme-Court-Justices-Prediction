mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
having
a
chart
brought
in
if
i
may
so
that
as
mr.
wallace
says
the
history
of
the
treatment
by
the
united
states
of
the
confederated
bands
in
ute
indians
--
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
by
the
united
states
is
somewhat
complicated.
i
would
like
to
use
this
to
give
a
picture
as
we
see
it
and
as
it
relates
to
the
case
before
the
court
today.
like
the
government’s
sketch,
this
is
adopted
from
royce
1896
bureau
of
ethnology
report
interpretation
of
indian
land
sessions
in
the
united
states.
prior
to
1868,
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
who
were
composed
of
the
white
river
band
the
uncompahgre
band,
and
the
southern
ute
band
occupied
in
the
usual
indian
fashion
a
tremendous
area
in
colorado,
new
mexico,
and
utah.
in
1868,
the
confederated
bands,
the
three
units
comprising
confederated
bands
agreed
to
limit
its
area
of
occupation
to
the
outside
perimeters
shown
on
this
sketch
approximately
or
just
slightly
lower
than
16
million
hectares.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
somewhere
between
3,000
and
4,000
people.
in
1873,
as
counsel
has
explained,
there
is
a
highly
mineralized
area
found
in
the
location
of
colorado
which
is
identified
here
as
royce
area
566.
the
united
states
obtained
from
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
and
an
agreement
to
cede
that
that
was
ceded
in
1873
and
ratified
by
an
act
of
congress
of
1874.
the
next
act
of
course
is
the
agreement
between
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
in
the
united
states
an
agreement
which
was
worked
out
by
nine
representatives
of
the
three
bands
constituting
with
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
over
a
period
of
several
weeks
in
washington.
as
indicated,
it
was
decided
by
the
people
of
colorado
and
probably
people
and
congress
that
the
confederated
bands
be
removed
from
colorado
because
of
many
things
but
because
eventually
of
the
meeker
massacre
which
occurred
in
1879.
that
agreement
provided
that
the
chiefs
and
headmen
of
the
confederated
bands
would
exercise
their
most
persuasive
powers
to
get
their
people
to
agree
to
a
cession
of
lands
indicated
in
what
i
call
the
1868
reservation
that
agreement
had
to
be
ratified
or
accepted
by
three
quarters
of
the
male
adult
utes.
it
was
to
be
brought
back
to
congress
for
ratification.
it
provided
for
assessment
of
the
1868
reservation
with
two
extremely
important
exceptions.
one
was
is
it
provided
that
the
uncompahgre
band
which
occupied
generally
the
middle
area
of
the
1868
reservation
was
to
be
provided
with
land
on
the
grand
river
near
the
mouth
of
the
gunnison
river
in
a
western
portion
of
middle
section
of
this
area.
the
other
important
exception
on
the
one
which
determines
this
case,
there’s
the
fact
that
i
preserved
for
the
southern
ute
area.
the
area
in
the
south
which
is
the
southern
utes
had
used
from
time
immemorial.
southern
utes
as
a
part
of
the
agreement
agreed
to
remove
to
and
remained
on
the
la
plata
river
and
the
area
adjacent
to
it
in
the
state
of
colorado
and
if
that
was
insufficient
then
on
the
la
plata
river
an
area
adjacent
in
the
territory
of
new
mexico.
this
was
the
way
of
expressing
where
the
southern
utes
were
living
and
continued
to
live.
on
the
first
definite
expression
of
this
comes
from
the
fact
that
mr.
manypenny
who
was
chairman
of
the
commission
appointed
pursuant
to
the
act
of
1880
when
he
visited
the
southern
utes
recommended
to
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
congress
that
the
area
heretofore
and
presently
occupied
by
the
southern
utes
should
be
preserved
for
the
home
of
the
southern
utes.
what
was
the
reaction
of
congress
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it’s
the
key
controversy
in
this
case
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
--
if
your
honor
please.
the
1880
treaty,
an
agreement
that
has
been
indicated
removed
in
the
southern
utes
for
whatever
purpose.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
whether
it
was
reserve
for
the
southern
utes,
that’s
right.
the
1882
act
came
along.
there
was
concern
in
the
attorney
general
to
congress
that
it
did
not
dispose
under
the
public
land
laws,
the
area
indicated
a
616
without
additional
legislation.
congress
responded
with
two
facts
in
the
1882
legislation.
first
it
opened
area
616
to
dispose
along
under
the
public
land
laws
and
it
provided
for
a
line
to
be
drawn
between
the
area
to
be
dispose
of
under
that
act
and
the
area
occupied
by
the
southern
ute
tribe.
that
line
was
drawn
as
i
indicate
from
the
southwest
corner
of
royce
area
566
to
the
boundary
of
the
territory
in
utah.
now
from
that
period
on
from
1882
until
1895,
in
every
session
of
congress
save
one,
in
most
days
most
of
the
congress
has
had
three
sessions.
there
was
legislation
pending
concerning
the
treatment
and
disposition
of
the
southern
utes
and
their
lands.
when
it
came
along
the
1888,
congress
passed
a
law
which
established
to
commission
to
negotiate
with
the
southern
utes
for
preservation
or
settlement
of
their
treaty
and
other
rights
including
the
possibility
of
exchange
of
“their
reservation.”
their
reservation
meant
only
royce
area
617.
they
reached
agreement
with
the
utes.
the
utes
agreed
to
the
southern
utes
to
trade
that
area
for
an
area
in
utah
territory
three
times
as
large
as
this.
there
was
objection
from
the
citizens
in
utah.
the
utes
were
sort
of
unwanted
people
at
this
time
even
the
territory
of
new
mexico
didn’t
want
them
to
move
there.
but
this
agreement
in
1888
which
provided
for
exchange
of
that
reservation
for
the
exchange
for
the
land
in
utah
was
reached
by
the
commission
and
it
passed
the
senate.
it
died
in
a
house.
still
there
was
a
continuation
of
legislative
effort
throughout.
in
about
1893
or
1894,
congress
sort
of
changed
this
direction
toward
the
handling
of
the
southern
ute
reservation
and
i
might
say
that
during
all
of
this
time,
there
was
adequate,
an
apple
administrative
recognition
of
the
ownership
of
the
area
royce
617
involved
on
the
part
of
administrative
officers
of
the
united
states.
when
1895
came
along,
congress
had
some
slight
heat
or
tension
to
the
act
of
1880
by
saying
that
the
property
involved
in
the
royce
area
617
should
be
handled
as
provided
by
the
1880
treaty
as
herein
provided.
it
then
changed
direction
considerably
from
what
it
had
done
in
the
1880
act.
the
1880
act
had
provided
for
instance
the
proceeds
from
the
lands
to
be
sold
in
the
royce
area
616
should
be
divided
three
ways
between
the
white
rivers,
the
uncompahgre,
and
the
southern
utes.
in
1895,
and
even
though
the
treaty
of
1868
had
required
that
any
session
of
ute
land
obtain
permission
from
three
quarters.
the
male,
adults
of
the
bands
involved
it
provided
possibly
different
factors.
first,
it
created
the
divisions
between
royce
area
617.
it
said,
those
members
of
the
southern
ute
tribe
who
elect
and
are
qualified
to
receive
allotments
shall
be
allotted
in
the
area
at
the
east
end
of
this
track
as
to
those
who
did
not
elect
or
were
not
qualified,
the
government
would
create
and
reserve
for
them
a
reservation
in
a
40-mile
track
in
the
western
end
of
royce
area
617.
congress
didn’t
require
the
three
quarters
of
the
male,
adult
utes
vote
for
this
required
only
a
majority
vote.
it
also
provided
that
within
six
months
following
the
passage
of
that
act,
the
president
should
arrange
for
the
allotments
for
those
to
be
allotted
in
the
eastern
end
and
the
balance
should
be
sold
under
the
public
land
lost
at
not
less
than
$1.25
per
acre.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
1895.
the
proclamation
was
actually
issued
four
years
later
in
1899.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
at
that
time
the
southern
utes
numbered
approximately
1,100.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
are
now
two
different
tribes,
if
your
honor
please.
this
is
now
known
as
the
ute
man
--
ute
band.
this
is
known
as
the
southern
ute
tribe.
the
southern
ute
tribe
latest
to
normal
is
just
under
800.
the
ute
man
--
ute
band
is
almost
as
large.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
acreage
in
royce
area
617
was
approximately
1,070,000
acres.
it
was
an
area
15
miles
wide
and
approximately
100
miles
long.
it
was
often
referred
to
as
15
x
100-mile
strip.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
there
were
approximately
1,100.
this
was
on
of
the
factors
which
caused
congress
to
give
this
problem
so
much
consideration
also
caused
the
administrative
officers
to
be
so
concerned.
the
southern
utes
were
setting
on
a
strip
of
land
these
15
miles
wide
and
advancing
settlement
was
encroaching
on
all
sides
especially
to
the
north
and
south.
the
city
of
durango
which
was
in
the
session
of
1873
along
in
1895
had
reached
the
population
4,000
people.
the
administrators
were
concerned
that
friction
would
develop
between
a
non-indians
and
indians
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
there
were
access
to
remove
the
southern
utes
from
what
the
administrative
officers
considered
a
small,
slender
portion
of
land
on
which
there
to
live.
now
the
area
on
the
east
which
was
not
allotted
was
put
up
for
sale
and
in
the
1902,
congress
passed
another
act
which
is
called
the
free
homestead
act.
now
the
1895
act
which
provided
for
the
allotting
in
the
east
provided
that
after
the
deduction
of
expenses
of
sale,
the
remainder,
the
proceeds
should
be
saved
and
put
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
southern
utes
and
the
southern
utes
only;
another
clear
indication
of
the
congressional
recognition
that
royce
area
617
was
southern
ute
territory.
now,
two
administrative
decisions
came
along
in
1903
and
1920.
1903
one
man
sought
a
homestead
in
that
area.
he
used
history,
the
fact
that
this
had
been
ceded
by
the
act
of
1880.
his
application
was
denied,
reviewed
and
denied
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
same
application
type
of
application
was
made
under
the
minerals
act
of
1920.
and
again
was
denied
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
the
final
main
act
which
shows
beyond
any
doubt
that
this
area,
royce
area
617
was
preserved
for
the
southern
utes
and
was
not
ceded
by
the
act
of
1880
is
a
fact
that
in
that
year,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
pursuant
to
provisions
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
restored
to
the
southern
ute
tribe
in
excess
of
300,000
acres
of
land
in
the
eastern
section
of
royce
area
617
which
had
not
been
disposed
of
under
the
public
land
laws.
in
the
meantime,
between
1900
and
1938,
the
united
states
government
had
given
away
free
to
homesteaders
in
excess
of
225,000
acres
of
land.
and
it
did
this
in
clear
violation
of
the
act
of
1895
which
provided
for
sale
of
that
land
to
settlers
at
not
less
than
$1.25
per
acre,
the
balance
to
be
saved
and
held
in
trust
for
the
southern
utes.
now,
the
government
says
we
ignore
all
of
this
history.
we
ignore
the
recognition
by
congress
over
continuing
long
period
of
time
and
we
do
this
because
in
the
settlement
of
other
cases
unrelated
to
this
area
involving
other
parties,
involving
other
issues
there
is
a
stipulation
which
provided
in
a
catchall
phrase
that
the
settlement
in
four
cases
which
were
involved
there
and
only
one
is
really
important
here
and
that
is
case
number
46640,
a
judgment
to
be
entered
is
res
judicata
not
only
as
to
the
land
described
in
schedule
1,
but
whether
included
there
in
or
not
also
as
to
any
land
formerly
owned
or
claimed
by
the
plaintiffs
in
western
colorado
ceded
to
defendant
by
the
act
of
june
15,
1880.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
if
the
court
should
find
contrary
to
what
we
think
is
the
fact
in
the
language
of
the
1880
act
that
legislative
history,
the
administrative
interpretation
that
this
area
royce
area
617
was
indeed
ceded
by
the
act
of
1880
then
i’m
afraid
that
the
southern
utes
will
never
have
an
opportunity
to
get
reimbursed
for
the
230,000
acres
given
away.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it’s
in
the
defendant’s
--
the
government’s
brief
page
43,
section
3
of
the
bottom
page.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
44.
if
your
honor
please,
the
second
full
paragraphs
said,
chiefs
and
headmen
agreed
to
do
what
was
required
by
the
agreement.
then
the
language
is
that
the
southern
utes
agree
to
remove
to
and
settle
upon
unoccupied
agricultural
lands
on
the
la
plata
river
in
colorado.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
area
616
was
yes.
it
was
ceded
in
trust.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
royce
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
because
it
treated
each
of
the
three
bands
of
the
confederated
utes
a
little
bit
differently.
the
white
rivers
who
were
in
the
northern
area
were
moved
to
utah
territory.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
except
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it’s
in
the
paragraph
before
you
honor,
except
this
hereinafter
after
provided
for
this
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
the
southern
utes
and
uncompahgre
utes
which
the
uncompahgre
ute
provision
is
dealt
with
on
the
top
of
page
45.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir,
we
do
and
we
think
that
conclusion
is
very
well
fortified
by
the
later
congressional
history
and
congressional
action
which
followed
the
adoption
of
this
act.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
well,
there
was
a
plan
file
for
the
uncompahgre
utes
and
that
claim
was
successful.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
for
failure
of
the
united
states
to
locate
land
for
them
on
the
grand
river
near
the
mouth
of
the
gunnison
river.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
we
think
there
is
and
that’s
the
basis
of
this
lawsuit
and
we
think
congress
thought
so
and
we
thought
the
adminis
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
it’s
a
preservation
of
the
land.
theretofore
occupied
by
the
southern
utes
and
we
say
this
constitutes
as
mr.
manypenny
put
it
a
preservation
of
the
land
now
and
here
fore
occupied
by
the
southern
utes.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
and
also
there
--
i
might
call
your
attention
the
fact
that
there
is
language
in
the
report
of
the
commission
of
indian
affairs
in
1881
which
provides
and
interprets
this
as
ceding
and
selling
the
diminished
1868
treaty
reservation
accepting
and
reserving
such
lands
on
the
la
plata
river
and
it's
vicinity
for
the
southern
utes
in
pursuance
of
the
act
of
1880.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
were
well-known
to
the
people
who
were
involved,
yes.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
i
don’t
think
it
is
we
oppose
the
remand,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
didn’t
think
its
necessary
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
with
the
court
of
claim.
i
think
both
parties
oppose
the
remand
but
when
the
remand
was
allowed,
we
introduced
the
evidence,
we
introduced
evidence
not
only
by
the
chief
attorney
for
the
utes
but
also
by
two
expert
plan
researchers
who
testified
that
before
the
stipulation
and
the
settlement
of
1950
they
were
working
at
our
request
on
compilation
of
records
for
the
southern
ute
tribe
involving
area
617.
the
government
of
course
is,
the
court
is
well
aware,
refused
to
offer
any
evidence
at
that
time.
now,
if
the
court
please,
if
it
feels
or
you
feel
that
there’s
some
uncertainty
about
whether
the
1880
act
did
cede
royce
area
617
and
we
submit
that
it
did
not
and
we
submit
as
i’ve
said
that
congress
and
the
administrative
did
not
think
so,
counsel
has
said
that
the
secretary
of
interior
in
1938
was
merely
mistaken
in
his
interpretation
of
this
act.
but
if
he
was
mistaken
he
gave
to
the
southern
ute
indians
over
300,000
acres
of
land
to
which
they
were
not
entitled.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it
was
an
allotment.
it
was
a
method
of
carrying
out
was
then
the
new
indian
policy
of
breaking
up
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no.
no,
the
united
states
held
this
land.
any
of
this
land
only
entrust
even
as
to
area
616,
it
held
that
entrust
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
confederated
bands
of
utes.
they
have
a
legal
title.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
because
congress
and
the
people
in
the
state
of
colorado
wanted
to
let
the
utes
out
of
colorado.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
title
was
already
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
--
legal
title
by
virtue
of
the
1863
treaty.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it
moved
the
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no,
it
removed
the
indians
personally.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no,
sir.
no
sir,
like
the
1868
treaty
the
united
states
is
merely
holding
that
land
in
trust
for
the
indians.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no,
sir.
in
fact,
your
honor
the
case
is
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
move
the
people
out
of
colorado.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
and
when
the
1882
act
came
along,
it
did
give
the
united
states
authority
to
dispose
of
this
land
under
the
public
land
laws.
the
attorney
general
brewster
advised
the
congress
in
1881
and
didn’t
have
authority
even
under
the
1880
act
to
dispose
of
this
land,
and
i’m
talking
of
616
without
additional
authority
from
congress.
likewise,
we
say
the
same
is
true
as
to
area
617
with
respect
to
the
southern
utes.
and
whatever
the
motivation
of
congress
was
in
1880,
it
let
all
southern
utes
occupy
that
area
just
as
they
had
theretofore
until
1895
when
it
retraced
it's
steps,
went
in
another
direction
and
provided
for
the
allotting
the
separate
reservation,
the
sale
of
some
of
the
eastern
area
and
then
the
proclamation
by
the
president
to
open
that
up
for
public
settling.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes.
it
provided
for
a
census
and
the
separation
of
the
three
bands
and
two
of
them
were
moved
to
utah
eventually
and
the
southern
ute
band
was
left
essentially
where
it
had
live
before.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
well
the
attorney
general,
the
following
year
told
the
man
then
enough
to
sell
it.
they
need
it
one
more
act
so
that
they
could
sell
track
616.
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
guess
there
are
450,000
acres
in
the
ute
reservation
which
was
created
by
the
act
of
1895.
the
population
of
that
group,
that
tribe
is
i
think
in
a
neighborhood
of
700
in
southern
ute
reservation
which
is
the
eastern
and
the
royce
area
617.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
approximately,
yes.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
still
have
that
and
they
will
continue
to
have
that.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
those
people
will
still
have
that
but
we’re
trying
to
collect
for
is
230,000
acres
of
land
in
the
area.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
my
arithmetic
is
a
little
too
slow
mr.
justice
black,
but
if
you
divide
thousand
into
400,000
and
i
guess
you’ll
get
a
400
hectares.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it
has
an
elevation
at
various
points
between
about
6,000
feet
and
12,000
feet.
it’s
fairly
mountainous
but
it
has
been
indicated
there
are
five
or
six
small
river
valleys
also.
and
notice
where
the
places
were
the
allotments
were
made
approximately
150,000
acres
of
land
was
allotted
pursuant
to
the
act
of
1895
and
the
government
gave
away
free
to
homesteaders
about
230,000
acres.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
settlement
was
for
lands
involved
in
royce
areas
616.
there
were
three
components
of
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians.
and
those
judgments
for
all
for
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
with
the
southern
utes
received
40%,
the
uncompahgre
utes
receive
i
think
20%,
and
the
white
river
utes
40%.
something
on
that
order
because
all
of
them
pursuant
to
the
treaty
of
1868
owned
the
land
involved
in
the
chart
you
see
before
you.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
just
under
32
million
and
the
most
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
biggest
part
was
one
case
which
approximated
$25
million.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
as
indians
claims
go
this
is
a
small
case.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
we
don’t
know.
this
is
still
in
an
interlocutory
stage.
my
guess
would
be
that
you’re
talking
about
230,000
acres
valued
in
different
tracks
as
between
1900
and
1938
of
land
which
is
not
extremely
valuable
and
also
we’re
dealing
and
asking
for
an
accounting
of
the
proceeds
of
other
land
sold
but
for
which
the
government
has
made
no
accounting
to
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
what
shows
in
their
reports
so
far
$215,000.00.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
right.
so
this
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
a
good
ballpark
guess
in
my
judgment.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
didn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
at
that
time
there
were
two
tribes
here,
each
of
them
got
20%,
combined
taking
all
southern
ute
tribe
they
got
40%.
likewise,
the
uncompahgre
band
got
approximately
the
same
and
the
white
river
band
got
about
20%.
now,
the
treaty
or
the
agreement
of
1880
provided
for
three
ways
split
between
these
bands
but
the
population
shifts
that
accrued
up
to
the
time
of
the
stipulation
in
1950
been
such.
but
the
tribes
agreed
among
themselves
upon
a
division
of
the
judgments
in
congress
ratified
that
agreement,
and
that’s
the
background
to
why
that
happened.
so
i
might
say,
one
thing
more,
if
i
may
impose
on
the
court.
if
there’s
uncertainty
about
what
the
act
of
1880
did,
we
ask
you
to
look
at
that
short
section
of
our
brief
in
which
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
as
early
as
1832
indicated
that
agreements
and
treaties
between
the
united
stated
and
the
tribes
should
not
be
interpreted
to
the
detriment
of
an
indian
tribes
and
we
ask
with
that
tradition
of
this
great
country
be
continued
in
this
case.
i
thank
you.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
having
a
chart
brought
in
if
i
may
so
that
as
mr.
wallace
says
the
history
of
the
treatment
by
the
united
states
of
the
confederated
bands
in
ute
indians
--
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
by
the
united
states
is
somewhat
complicated.
i
would
like
to
use
this
to
give
a
picture
as
we
see
it
and
as
it
relates
to
the
case
before
the
court
today.
like
the
government’s
sketch,
this
is
adopted
from
royce
1896
bureau
of
ethnology
report
interpretation
of
indian
land
sessions
in
the
united
states.
prior
to
1868,
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
who
were
composed
of
the
white
river
band
the
uncompahgre
band,
and
the
southern
ute
band
occupied
in
the
usual
indian
fashion
a
tremendous
area
in
colorado,
new
mexico,
and
utah.
in
1868,
the
confederated
bands,
the
three
units
comprising
confederated
bands
agreed
to
limit
its
area
of
occupation
to
the
outside
perimeters
shown
on
this
sketch
approximately
or
just
slightly
lower
than
16
million
hectares.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
somewhere
between
3,000
and
4,000
people.
in
1873,
as
counsel
has
explained,
there
is
a
highly
mineralized
area
found
in
the
location
of
colorado
which
is
identified
here
as
royce
area
566.
the
united
states
obtained
from
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
and
an
agreement
to
cede
that
that
was
ceded
in
1873
and
ratified
by
an
act
of
congress
of
1874.
the
next
act
of
course
is
the
agreement
between
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
in
the
united
states
an
agreement
which
was
worked
out
by
nine
representatives
of
the
three
bands
constituting
with
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
over
a
period
of
several
weeks
in
washington.
as
indicated,
it
was
decided
by
the
people
of
colorado
and
probably
people
and
congress
that
the
confederated
bands
be
removed
from
colorado
because
of
many
things
but
because
eventually
of
the
meeker
massacre
which
occurred
in
1879.
that
agreement
provided
that
the
chiefs
and
headmen
of
the
confederated
bands
would
exercise
their
most
persuasive
powers
to
get
their
people
to
agree
to
a
cession
of
lands
indicated
in
what
i
call
the
1868
reservation
that
agreement
had
to
be
ratified
or
accepted
by
three
quarters
of
the
male
adult
utes.
it
was
to
be
brought
back
to
congress
for
ratification.
it
provided
for
assessment
of
the
1868
reservation
with
two
extremely
important
exceptions.
one
was
is
it
provided
that
the
uncompahgre
band
which
occupied
generally
the
middle
area
of
the
1868
reservation
was
to
be
provided
with
land
on
the
grand
river
near
the
mouth
of
the
gunnison
river
in
a
western
portion
of
middle
section
of
this
area.
the
other
important
exception
on
the
one
which
determines
this
case,
there’s
the
fact
that
i
preserved
for
the
southern
ute
area.
the
area
in
the
south
which
is
the
southern
utes
had
used
from
time
immemorial.
southern
utes
as
a
part
of
the
agreement
agreed
to
remove
to
and
remained
on
the
la
plata
river
and
the
area
adjacent
to
it
in
the
state
of
colorado
and
if
that
was
insufficient
then
on
the
la
plata
river
an
area
adjacent
in
the
territory
of
new
mexico.
this
was
the
way
of
expressing
where
the
southern
utes
were
living
and
continued
to
live.
on
the
first
definite
expression
of
this
comes
from
the
fact
that
mr.
manypenny
who
was
chairman
of
the
commission
appointed
pursuant
to
the
act
of
1880
when
he
visited
the
southern
utes
recommended
to
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
congress
that
the
area
heretofore
and
presently
occupied
by
the
southern
utes
should
be
preserved
for
the
home
of
the
southern
utes.
what
was
the
reaction
of
congress
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it’s
the
key
controversy
in
this
case
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
--
if
your
honor
please.
the
1880
treaty,
an
agreement
that
has
been
indicated
removed
in
the
southern
utes
for
whatever
purpose.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
whether
it
was
reserve
for
the
southern
utes,
that’s
right.
the
1882
act
came
along.
there
was
concern
in
the
attorney
general
to
congress
that
it
did
not
dispose
under
the
public
land
laws,
the
area
indicated
a
616
without
additional
legislation.
congress
responded
with
two
facts
in
the
1882
legislation.
first
it
opened
area
616
to
dispose
along
under
the
public
land
laws
and
it
provided
for
a
line
to
be
drawn
between
the
area
to
be
dispose
of
under
that
act
and
the
area
occupied
by
the
southern
ute
tribe.
that
line
was
drawn
as
i
indicate
from
the
southwest
corner
of
royce
area
566
to
the
boundary
of
the
territory
in
utah.
now
from
that
period
on
from
1882
until
1895,
in
every
session
of
congress
save
one,
in
most
days
most
of
the
congress
has
had
three
sessions.
there
was
legislation
pending
concerning
the
treatment
and
disposition
of
the
southern
utes
and
their
lands.
when
it
came
along
the
1888,
congress
passed
a
law
which
established
to
commission
to
negotiate
with
the
southern
utes
for
preservation
or
settlement
of
their
treaty
and
other
rights
including
the
possibility
of
exchange
of
“their
reservation.”
their
reservation
meant
only
royce
area
617.
they
reached
agreement
with
the
utes.
the
utes
agreed
to
the
southern
utes
to
trade
that
area
for
an
area
in
utah
territory
three
times
as
large
as
this.
there
was
objection
from
the
citizens
in
utah.
the
utes
were
sort
of
unwanted
people
at
this
time
even
the
territory
of
new
mexico
didn’t
want
them
to
move
there.
but
this
agreement
in
1888
which
provided
for
exchange
of
that
reservation
for
the
exchange
for
the
land
in
utah
was
reached
by
the
commission
and
it
passed
the
senate.
it
died
in
a
house.
still
there
was
a
continuation
of
legislative
effort
throughout.
in
about
1893
or
1894,
congress
sort
of
changed
this
direction
toward
the
handling
of
the
southern
ute
reservation
and
i
might
say
that
during
all
of
this
time,
there
was
adequate,
an
apple
administrative
recognition
of
the
ownership
of
the
area
royce
617
involved
on
the
part
of
administrative
officers
of
the
united
states.
when
1895
came
along,
congress
had
some
slight
heat
or
tension
to
the
act
of
1880
by
saying
that
the
property
involved
in
the
royce
area
617
should
be
handled
as
provided
by
the
1880
treaty
as
herein
provided.
it
then
changed
direction
considerably
from
what
it
had
done
in
the
1880
act.
the
1880
act
had
provided
for
instance
the
proceeds
from
the
lands
to
be
sold
in
the
royce
area
616
should
be
divided
three
ways
between
the
white
rivers,
the
uncompahgre,
and
the
southern
utes.
in
1895,
and
even
though
the
treaty
of
1868
had
required
that
any
session
of
ute
land
obtain
permission
from
three
quarters.
the
male,
adults
of
the
bands
involved
it
provided
possibly
different
factors.
first,
it
created
the
divisions
between
royce
area
617.
it
said,
those
members
of
the
southern
ute
tribe
who
elect
and
are
qualified
to
receive
allotments
shall
be
allotted
in
the
area
at
the
east
end
of
this
track
as
to
those
who
did
not
elect
or
were
not
qualified,
the
government
would
create
and
reserve
for
them
a
reservation
in
a
40-mile
track
in
the
western
end
of
royce
area
617.
congress
didn’t
require
the
three
quarters
of
the
male,
adult
utes
vote
for
this
required
only
a
majority
vote.
it
also
provided
that
within
six
months
following
the
passage
of
that
act,
the
president
should
arrange
for
the
allotments
for
those
to
be
allotted
in
the
eastern
end
and
the
balance
should
be
sold
under
the
public
land
lost
at
not
less
than
$1.25
per
acre.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
1895.
the
proclamation
was
actually
issued
four
years
later
in
1899.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
at
that
time
the
southern
utes
numbered
approximately
1,100.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
are
now
two
different
tribes,
if
your
honor
please.
this
is
now
known
as
the
ute
man
--
ute
band.
this
is
known
as
the
southern
ute
tribe.
the
southern
ute
tribe
latest
to
normal
is
just
under
800.
the
ute
man
--
ute
band
is
almost
as
large.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
acreage
in
royce
area
617
was
approximately
1,070,000
acres.
it
was
an
area
15
miles
wide
and
approximately
100
miles
long.
it
was
often
referred
to
as
15
x
100-mile
strip.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
there
were
approximately
1,100.
this
was
on
of
the
factors
which
caused
congress
to
give
this
problem
so
much
consideration
also
caused
the
administrative
officers
to
be
so
concerned.
the
southern
utes
were
setting
on
a
strip
of
land
these
15
miles
wide
and
advancing
settlement
was
encroaching
on
all
sides
especially
to
the
north
and
south.
the
city
of
durango
which
was
in
the
session
of
1873
along
in
1895
had
reached
the
population
4,000
people.
the
administrators
were
concerned
that
friction
would
develop
between
a
non-indians
and
indians
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
there
were
access
to
remove
the
southern
utes
from
what
the
administrative
officers
considered
a
small,
slender
portion
of
land
on
which
there
to
live.
now
the
area
on
the
east
which
was
not
allotted
was
put
up
for
sale
and
in
the
1902,
congress
passed
another
act
which
is
called
the
free
homestead
act.
now
the
1895
act
which
provided
for
the
allotting
in
the
east
provided
that
after
the
deduction
of
expenses
of
sale,
the
remainder,
the
proceeds
should
be
saved
and
put
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
southern
utes
and
the
southern
utes
only;
another
clear
indication
of
the
congressional
recognition
that
royce
area
617
was
southern
ute
territory.
now,
two
administrative
decisions
came
along
in
1903
and
1920.
1903
one
man
sought
a
homestead
in
that
area.
he
used
history,
the
fact
that
this
had
been
ceded
by
the
act
of
1880.
his
application
was
denied,
reviewed
and
denied
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
same
application
type
of
application
was
made
under
the
minerals
act
of
1920.
and
again
was
denied
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
the
final
main
act
which
shows
beyond
any
doubt
that
this
area,
royce
area
617
was
preserved
for
the
southern
utes
and
was
not
ceded
by
the
act
of
1880
is
a
fact
that
in
that
year,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
pursuant
to
provisions
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
restored
to
the
southern
ute
tribe
in
excess
of
300,000
acres
of
land
in
the
eastern
section
of
royce
area
617
which
had
not
been
disposed
of
under
the
public
land
laws.
in
the
meantime,
between
1900
and
1938,
the
united
states
government
had
given
away
free
to
homesteaders
in
excess
of
225,000
acres
of
land.
and
it
did
this
in
clear
violation
of
the
act
of
1895
which
provided
for
sale
of
that
land
to
settlers
at
not
less
than
$1.25
per
acre,
the
balance
to
be
saved
and
held
in
trust
for
the
southern
utes.
now,
the
government
says
we
ignore
all
of
this
history.
we
ignore
the
recognition
by
congress
over
continuing
long
period
of
time
and
we
do
this
because
in
the
settlement
of
other
cases
unrelated
to
this
area
involving
other
parties,
involving
other
issues
there
is
a
stipulation
which
provided
in
a
catchall
phrase
that
the
settlement
in
four
cases
which
were
involved
there
and
only
one
is
really
important
here
and
that
is
case
number
46640,
a
judgment
to
be
entered
is
res
judicata
not
only
as
to
the
land
described
in
schedule
1,
but
whether
included
there
in
or
not
also
as
to
any
land
formerly
owned
or
claimed
by
the
plaintiffs
in
western
colorado
ceded
to
defendant
by
the
act
of
june
15,
1880.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
if
the
court
should
find
contrary
to
what
we
think
is
the
fact
in
the
language
of
the
1880
act
that
legislative
history,
the
administrative
interpretation
that
this
area
royce
area
617
was
indeed
ceded
by
the
act
of
1880
then
i’m
afraid
that
the
southern
utes
will
never
have
an
opportunity
to
get
reimbursed
for
the
230,000
acres
given
away.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it’s
in
the
defendant’s
--
the
government’s
brief
page
43,
section
3
of
the
bottom
page.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
44.
if
your
honor
please,
the
second
full
paragraphs
said,
chiefs
and
headmen
agreed
to
do
what
was
required
by
the
agreement.
then
the
language
is
that
the
southern
utes
agree
to
remove
to
and
settle
upon
unoccupied
agricultural
lands
on
the
la
plata
river
in
colorado.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
area
616
was
yes.
it
was
ceded
in
trust.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
royce
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
because
it
treated
each
of
the
three
bands
of
the
confederated
utes
a
little
bit
differently.
the
white
rivers
who
were
in
the
northern
area
were
moved
to
utah
territory.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
except
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it’s
in
the
paragraph
before
you
honor,
except
this
hereinafter
after
provided
for
this
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
the
southern
utes
and
uncompahgre
utes
which
the
uncompahgre
ute
provision
is
dealt
with
on
the
top
of
page
45.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes
sir,
we
do
and
we
think
that
conclusion
is
very
well
fortified
by
the
later
congressional
history
and
congressional
action
which
followed
the
adoption
of
this
act.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
well,
there
was
a
plan
file
for
the
uncompahgre
utes
and
that
claim
was
successful.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
for
failure
of
the
united
states
to
locate
land
for
them
on
the
grand
river
near
the
mouth
of
the
gunnison
river.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
we
think
there
is
and
that’s
the
basis
of
this
lawsuit
and
we
think
congress
thought
so
and
we
thought
the
adminis
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
it’s
a
preservation
of
the
land.
theretofore
occupied
by
the
southern
utes
and
we
say
this
constitutes
as
mr.
manypenny
put
it
a
preservation
of
the
land
now
and
here
fore
occupied
by
the
southern
utes.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes,
sir.
and
also
there
--
i
might
call
your
attention
the
fact
that
there
is
language
in
the
report
of
the
commission
of
indian
affairs
in
1881
which
provides
and
interprets
this
as
ceding
and
selling
the
diminished
1868
treaty
reservation
accepting
and
reserving
such
lands
on
the
la
plata
river
and
it's
vicinity
for
the
southern
utes
in
pursuance
of
the
act
of
1880.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
were
well-known
to
the
people
who
were
involved,
yes.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
i
don’t
think
it
is
we
oppose
the
remand,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
didn’t
think
its
necessary
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
with
the
court
of
claim.
i
think
both
parties
oppose
the
remand
but
when
the
remand
was
allowed,
we
introduced
the
evidence,
we
introduced
evidence
not
only
by
the
chief
attorney
for
the
utes
but
also
by
two
expert
plan
researchers
who
testified
that
before
the
stipulation
and
the
settlement
of
1950
they
were
working
at
our
request
on
compilation
of
records
for
the
southern
ute
tribe
involving
area
617.
the
government
of
course
is,
the
court
is
well
aware,
refused
to
offer
any
evidence
at
that
time.
now,
if
the
court
please,
if
it
feels
or
you
feel
that
there’s
some
uncertainty
about
whether
the
1880
act
did
cede
royce
area
617
and
we
submit
that
it
did
not
and
we
submit
as
i’ve
said
that
congress
and
the
administrative
did
not
think
so,
counsel
has
said
that
the
secretary
of
interior
in
1938
was
merely
mistaken
in
his
interpretation
of
this
act.
but
if
he
was
mistaken
he
gave
to
the
southern
ute
indians
over
300,000
acres
of
land
to
which
they
were
not
entitled.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it
was
an
allotment.
it
was
a
method
of
carrying
out
was
then
the
new
indian
policy
of
breaking
up
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no.
no,
the
united
states
held
this
land.
any
of
this
land
only
entrust
even
as
to
area
616,
it
held
that
entrust
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
confederated
bands
of
utes.
they
have
a
legal
title.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
because
congress
and
the
people
in
the
state
of
colorado
wanted
to
let
the
utes
out
of
colorado.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
title
was
already
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
--
legal
title
by
virtue
of
the
1863
treaty.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it
moved
the
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no,
it
removed
the
indians
personally.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no,
sir.
no
sir,
like
the
1868
treaty
the
united
states
is
merely
holding
that
land
in
trust
for
the
indians.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
no,
sir.
in
fact,
your
honor
the
case
is
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
move
the
people
out
of
colorado.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
and
when
the
1882
act
came
along,
it
did
give
the
united
states
authority
to
dispose
of
this
land
under
the
public
land
laws.
the
attorney
general
brewster
advised
the
congress
in
1881
and
didn’t
have
authority
even
under
the
1880
act
to
dispose
of
this
land,
and
i’m
talking
of
616
without
additional
authority
from
congress.
likewise,
we
say
the
same
is
true
as
to
area
617
with
respect
to
the
southern
utes.
and
whatever
the
motivation
of
congress
was
in
1880,
it
let
all
southern
utes
occupy
that
area
just
as
they
had
theretofore
until
1895
when
it
retraced
it's
steps,
went
in
another
direction
and
provided
for
the
allotting
the
separate
reservation,
the
sale
of
some
of
the
eastern
area
and
then
the
proclamation
by
the
president
to
open
that
up
for
public
settling.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
yes.
it
provided
for
a
census
and
the
separation
of
the
three
bands
and
two
of
them
were
moved
to
utah
eventually
and
the
southern
ute
band
was
left
essentially
where
it
had
live
before.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
well
the
attorney
general,
the
following
year
told
the
man
then
enough
to
sell
it.
they
need
it
one
more
act
so
that
they
could
sell
track
616.
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
guess
there
are
450,000
acres
in
the
ute
reservation
which
was
created
by
the
act
of
1895.
the
population
of
that
group,
that
tribe
is
i
think
in
a
neighborhood
of
700
in
southern
ute
reservation
which
is
the
eastern
and
the
royce
area
617.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
approximately,
yes.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
still
have
that
and
they
will
continue
to
have
that.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
those
people
will
still
have
that
but
we’re
trying
to
collect
for
is
230,000
acres
of
land
in
the
area.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
my
arithmetic
is
a
little
too
slow
mr.
justice
black,
but
if
you
divide
thousand
into
400,000
and
i
guess
you’ll
get
a
400
hectares.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
it
has
an
elevation
at
various
points
between
about
6,000
feet
and
12,000
feet.
it’s
fairly
mountainous
but
it
has
been
indicated
there
are
five
or
six
small
river
valleys
also.
and
notice
where
the
places
were
the
allotments
were
made
approximately
150,000
acres
of
land
was
allotted
pursuant
to
the
act
of
1895
and
the
government
gave
away
free
to
homesteaders
about
230,000
acres.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
settlement
was
for
lands
involved
in
royce
areas
616.
there
were
three
components
of
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians.
and
those
judgments
for
all
for
the
confederated
bands
of
ute
indians
with
the
southern
utes
received
40%,
the
uncompahgre
utes
receive
i
think
20%,
and
the
white
river
utes
40%.
something
on
that
order
because
all
of
them
pursuant
to
the
treaty
of
1868
owned
the
land
involved
in
the
chart
you
see
before
you.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
just
under
32
million
and
the
most
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
the
biggest
part
was
one
case
which
approximated
$25
million.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
as
indians
claims
go
this
is
a
small
case.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
we
don’t
know.
this
is
still
in
an
interlocutory
stage.
my
guess
would
be
that
you’re
talking
about
230,000
acres
valued
in
different
tracks
as
between
1900
and
1938
of
land
which
is
not
extremely
valuable
and
also
we’re
dealing
and
asking
for
an
accounting
of
the
proceeds
of
other
land
sold
but
for
which
the
government
has
made
no
accounting
to
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
what
shows
in
their
reports
so
far
$215,000.00.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
right.
so
this
--
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
that’s
a
good
ballpark
guess
in
my
judgment.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
they
didn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
glen
a.
wilkinson
at
that
time
there
were
two
tribes
here,
each
of
them
got
20%,
combined
taking
all
southern
ute
tribe
they
got
40%.
likewise,
the
uncompahgre
band
got
approximately
the
same
and
the
white
river
band
got
about
20%.
now,
the
treaty
or
the
agreement
of
1880
provided
for
three
ways
split
between
these
bands
but
the
population
shifts
that
accrued
up
to
the
time
of
the
stipulation
in
1950
been
such.
but
the
tribes
agreed
among
themselves
upon
a
division
of
the
judgments
in
congress
ratified
that
agreement,
and
that’s
the
background
to
why
that
happened.
so
i
might
say,
one
thing
more,
if
i
may
impose
on
the
court.
if
there’s
uncertainty
about
what
the
act
of
1880
did,
we
ask
you
to
look
at
that
short
section
of
our
brief
in
which
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
as
early
as
1832
indicated
that
agreements
and
treaties
between
the
united
stated
and
the
tribes
should
not
be
interpreted
to
the
detriment
of
an
indian
tribes
and
we
ask
with
that
tradition
of
this
great
country
be
continued
in
this
case.
i
thank
you.
