unknown
speaker
how
does
this
court
move
into
this,
are
we
suppose
to
speed
them
up?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
however
that
you
told
us
of
that
those
southern
indians
were
to
be
settled
along
the
la
plata
valley
giving
them
homesteads
and
severalty?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
la
plata
valley
is
a
rather
small
area
marked
in
green
here,
if
that
what
you
said
is
correct,
i
don’t
quite
see
necessity
of
the
1882
--
unknown
speaker
where
was
that
in
this
map?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
created
or
perhaps,
you
can
say
recreated
as
a
reservation
in
1895
for
the
southern
utes?
unknown
speaker
say
it
was
the
left
corner
of
it?
left
corner
of
what?
unknown
speaker
until
1895?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
reservations
of
the
claims
of
the
southern
utes
in
the
settlement?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
going
to,
mr.
wallace
you
are
going
to
address
yourself
to
what
doors
the
other
side
claims
were
left
open
by
the
settlement?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
--
but
how
does
the
other
side
get
into
this,
take
this
settlement
agreement
a
part,
say
well
it
settles
something
but
not
others.
i
mean
what
language
and
it
leaves
anything
open?
unknown
speaker
but
only
covered,
for
one
thing
it
only
covered
lands
ceded
by
the
act
of
1880,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there’s
some
argument
about
that
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
with
the
court
of
claim
--
the
majority
of
court
of
claims
sought
something
was
left
over
--
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
were,
mr.
wallace?
unknown
speaker
about
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
it
wasn’t.
let’s
assume
it
wasn’t
and
parol
evidence
was
a
quite
proper.
unknown
speaker
what
would
have
been
the
issue?
what
would
have
been
the
evidence
so,
what
would
the
claim
--
what
would
have
been
suggested
was
left
open?
i
mean
in
terms
of
the
settlement
language
we
didn’t
mean
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
now,
what’s
your
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
confusion
exist
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
think
of
whatever
confusion
there
was,
was
washed
down
in
the
settlement?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
amount
of
the
initial
award
that’s
been
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
questions
in
the
case
is
whether
if
that
was
a
reservation
or
whether
it
was
simply
a
designation
of
the
area
to
be
occupied
by
the
southern
members
of
the
confederated
ute
tribes
and
severalty,
isn’t
that
one
of
the
issue
you?
you
stated
this
is
the
fact,
isn’t
that
a
matter
of
some
controversy
between
you
and
your
brother
counsel?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
and
whether
or
not
that
was
a
reservation
at
that
time,
is
a
key
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
in
what
year
1895?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
about
how
many
utes
there
were
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
what
are
they
number
now?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
acreage?
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
there
were
how
many
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
language
of
the
1880
act
at
which
the
government
denies
of
having
ceded
the
entire
reservation?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
44?
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
do
you
dispute
that
the
rest
of
the
reservation
was
ceded
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
alright.
but
where
in
this
language
do
you
find
the
distinction
between
616
in
the
royce
617?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
it
ceded
one,
why
didn’t
it
cede
the
other?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
true
but
the
cession
language
that
applies
generally
is
the
entire
area.
unknown
speaker
if
it
ceded,
well
except
this
herein.
but
where
is
the,
except?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
except
this
hereinafter,
where
is
that
hereinafter?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
do
you
think
that’s
an
exception
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
then
that
they’re
still
unclaimed
outstanding
within
the
southern
utes?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
--
unknown
speaker
they
didn’t
carry
on
the
strip
but
there
was
no
question
on
what
the
lands
have
been
ceded?
unknown
speaker
upon
which
you
rely
as
the
last
four
paragraph
on
page
44,
isn’t
it?
and
you
say
that’s
a
reservation
for
the
southern
utes?
unknown
speaker
and
you
drop
the
fee
and
you
say
it
was
a
reservation,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
--
mr.
wilkinson,
i
gather
that
this
provision
on
page
45,
allotments
in
severalty.
does
an
allotment
presuppose
that
the
united
states
had
land
to
allot?
unknown
speaker
no,
my
question
was
whether
a
provision
for
allotments
in
the
severalty
must
be
--
was
or
was
not
on
a
premise
that
the
united
states
had
land
to
allot.
unknown
speaker
yes,
to
hold
it
in
trust.
why
was
there
a
cession
of
616?
unknown
speaker
they
wanted
to
put
title
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
as
trustee?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
the
cession
accomplished?
unknown
speaker
it
removed
the
indian
claim?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
removed
whatever
claim
on
the
property
it
had.
unknown
speaker
then
the
1880
cession
to
the
extent
--
the
1880
cession
whatever
it
appraised
did
not
terminate
the
trust
and
was
not
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
cession
accomplished?
unknown
speaker
a
cession
does
nothing
except
moved
the
people
physically,
right?
unknown
speaker
on
the
bottom
of
this,
the
parties
to
this
1880
arrangement
must
have
had
--
they
must
have
thought
the
session
was
doing
something
because
they
recited
that
the
utes
would
cede
but
on
the
condition
that
the
government
cause
the
land
so
set
apart
to
be
surveyed
and
divided
among
the
indians
in
severalty.
and
that
as
soon
as
the
consent
of
the
tribe,
the
permission
shall
be
sent
to
superintendent
to
remove
the
settlement
of
the
utes.
and
in
consideration
of
the
cession
of
the
territory,
they
must
have
thought
the
cession
did
something?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkinson,
what
--
the
title
is
enact
to
accept
and
ratify
the
agreements
for
the
sale
of
their
reservation
in
the
said
state?
what
were
they
selling?
unknown
speaker
if
those
are
none,
your
theory
of
the
case,
what
is
the
estimation
for
that
40%
as
part
of
the
settlement
the
southern
utes
got
in
1957?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
money
that’s
involved
total
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
32
million
representing
what?
unknown
speaker
so
as
involved
on
this
was
litigated?
is
this
suit
we
have
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
how
much
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
and
how
much
did
the
government
get
for
that
land?
that’s
a
230,000
acres,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
$215,000.00?
unknown
speaker
and
this
case
is
under
a
million
dollars,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
still
don’t
understand
why
the
southern
utes
premise
is
proscribed
that
way
in
1957?
is
that
(inaudible)
here?
unknown
speaker
they
got
40%?
