warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
in
number
73,
phillips
against
martin
marietta
corporation
and
mr.
robinson
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
it's
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
act
reach
to
the
government
as
an
employer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
a
federal
judge
as
a
matter
of
general
policy
would
decline
to
hire
a
law
clerk,
who
had
an
infant
child,
a
lady
law
clerk,
but
was
willing
to
hire
a
men
whose
wives
had
infant
children,
they
would
be
in
violation
of
the
statute,
if
the
statute
applies
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
sure,
it
doesn't
apply
to
federal
judges.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
remember,
we
can't
be
that
sure
that
the
traditional
branch
is
necessarily
in
that
category,
i
suppose?[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
would
follow
automatically
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
require
quite
an
extension
of
that
doctrine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
can't
have
that
rule
just
because
he
doesn't
want
to
take
the
risk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
his
history
showed
that
there
were
considerable
risks,
would
that
be
a
justification
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
he
have
--
on
the
occupational
section
of
the
statute
could
he
have
a
policy,
an
announced
policy
under
this
act,
that
he
would
not
hire
either
an
expectant
mother
or
women
for
six
months
after
her
last
child
was
born.
is
there
a
rational
basis
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
trying
to
see
how
far
you
can
carry
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
possible
problems
of
equal
protection
issues
with
the
government,
that's
millions
of
millions
of
employees
not
being
subject
to
the
act,
that
the
private
employer
is
subject?
people
able
to
obtain
employment
with
the
government
on
one
hand
where
they
could
not
on
the
fifth
circuit
theory,
obtain
employment
with
the
private
employer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
maybe
--
then
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
federal
judges,
for
example,
could
not
have
such
a
rule
as
i
have
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
use
a
neutral
word
like
distinction.
you
are
saying
no
distinction
can
be
made
if
it
is
something
in
addition
to
being
a
woman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
prevail
that
will
be
the
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
recall
it,
this
provision
this
classification
was
added
to
the
bill
at
a
later
stage.
how
long
after
the
sex
classification
was
added
was
the
vote
taken
and
the
bill
passed
or
the
vote
taken
and
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
obviously
it
was
put
in
before
on
the
passage,
but
how
long,
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
am
not
speaking
of
that.
i
am
speaking
of
the
addition
of
sex
as
a
classification
to
the
other
classifications
that
are
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
it
quite
late
in
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
would
be
true
with
private
secretaries
who
by
and
large,
99%
plus
are
women?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
what
page
is
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
common
practice
in
all
the
circuits,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
they
assemble
in
martin
marietta?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
we
ask
how
many
of
them
are
women?[attempt
to
laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
their
statistic
showed
that
they
had
a
higher
rate
of
accidents,
so
the
woman
with
children,
two
or
three
and
four
years
of
age,
would
that
be,
justification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
wouldn't
that
be
quite
significant
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
might
get
down
to
very,
very
seemingly
small
thing,
this
one
they
got
into
it.
for
example,
it
might
show
that
married
women
with
teen
--
with
preschool
age
children,
made
on
an
average
five
telephone
calls
to
one
for
all
other
women,
would
that
be
irrelevant,
telephone
calls
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
an
assembly
line?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
don't
think
the
employer
has
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
long
distance
seeing
that
he
can
show
that
the
woman
in
that
posture
with
those
responsibilities
makes
five
times
as
many
telephone
calls
as
other
types
of
persons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
he,
must
he
hire
her
in
the
first
place
or
would
that
not
be
dispositive
under
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace.
mr.
senterfitt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
assumption
that
perhaps
martin
marietta
hires
--
refuses
to
hire
men
with
preschool
age
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
we
have
got
to
view
this
record
just
as
though
it
had
evidence
or
allegations
that
men
who
had
pre-school-age
children
with
no
mother
at
home
to
take
care
of
them.
in
other
words,
where
the
man
had
the
same
custodial
supervisory
role
as
the
wife,
would
not
be
hired,
is
that?
that
seems
to
be
what
your
position
adds
up
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
make
an
argument
that
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record,
this
admittedly
limited
record
that
men
were
not
treated
the
same
way
if
they
had
custodial
care
of
children
at
home.
and
that
therefore,
the
record
is
sufficient
to
support
the
district
judge's
findings
without
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
senterfitt,
are
there
some
suggestion
on
what
court
of
appeals
en
banc,
the
ten
judges
thought.
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
whole
didn't
do
anything
with
this
case
except
refused
to
rehear
it,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
all
we
have
is
the
views
of
the
three
members
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
views
of
other
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
who
thought
--
that
they
thought
that
to
be
heard
by
the
entire
court.
that's
the
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
don't
mean
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
assumed
up
to
this
time
mr.
senterfitt
that
reason
you
have
75
or
80%
women
is
that,
again
something
i
take
judicial
notice
of
from
many
years
of
contact
with
industry
that
women
are
manually
much
more
adapt
than
men
and
they
do
this
kind
of
work
better
than
man
do
it,
and
that's
why
you
hire
women.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
the
same
reason
that
most
man
hire
women
their
secretaries,
because
they
are
better
at
it
than
men.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
a
preconception
--
as
preconception
that
's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
department
of
justice
i
am
sure
doesn't
have
an
male
secretaries.
this
is
an
indication
of
it.
they
hire
women
secretaries,
because
they
are
better
at
it.
you
hire
women
assembly
people,
because
they
are
better
and
you
link
the
distinction
between
women
who
have
small
children
and
women
who
don't,
so
it
appears
on
the
record.
i
think
there
is
two
minutes
remaining
mr.
robinson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
concede
of
course
that
martin
marietta
is
not
discriminating
against
women
on
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
robinson.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

assembly
people,
because
they
are
better
and
you
link
the
distinction
between
women
who
have
small
children
and
women
who
don't,
so
it
appears
on
the
record.
i
think
there
is
two
minutes
remaining
mr.
robinson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
concede
of
course
that
martin
marietta
is
not
discriminating
against
women
on
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
robinson.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
