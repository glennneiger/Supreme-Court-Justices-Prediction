mr.
william
l.
robinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
question
of
statutory
construction
of
section
703
(a)
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
section
703
(a)
permits
an
employer
to
refuse
to
hire
women
with
pre-school-age
children,
while
hiring
men
with
pre-school-age
children.
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
standard
or
exemption
to
the
act
under
section
703
(e)
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
standard
which
permits
an
employer
to
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
religion
or
national
origin
if
it
is
a
bona
fide
occupation
qualification.
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that,
it's
not
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
know
whether
it's
agreed
to
both
sides
sir,
but
it
was
not
raised
as
a
defense
below.
we
will
concede,
of
course
your
honor,
that
if
the
case
is
reversed
and
goes
to
a
file
below,
they
would
have
the
opportunity
to
raise
that
defense
then.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
the
dissenters
said
that
the
company
should
have
the
right
to
raise
the
defense,
which
we
of
course
concede.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir,
i
will.
petitioner
mrs.
ida
phillips
is
the
mother
of
7
children,
who
range
in
age
from
3-15
years,
when
she
applied
to
work
with
respondent
martin
marietta
company.
in
september,
1966,
petitioner
applied
for
a
job
with
respondent
as
an
assembly
trainee
in
response
to
its
advertisement
of
100
such
positions.
petitioner
had
a
high
school
diploma,
which
was
the
only
stated
qualification
for
the
job.
however,
respondent
told
her,
that
it
would
not
consider
her
for
the
job
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school
age
children.
thereafter,
petitioner
filed
a
timely
charge,
alleging
discrimination
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children
with
the
eeoc.
the
eeoc
made
a
finding
of
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
refusal
to
hire
her
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children,
constituted
a
violation
of
the
act.
when
the
commission
was
unable
to
obtain
voluntary
compliance,
the
commission
authorized
her
to
file
a
suit,
which
she
did.
after
petitioner
filed
the
suit,
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
which
the
district
court
treated
as
a
motion
to
strike
and
struck
from
petitioner's
claim
--
from
petitioner's
complaint
those
allegations
claiming
that
she
was
discriminated
against
because
she
was
because
she
had
pre-school-age
children.
thereafter,
respondent
answered
the
complaint
admitting
that
its
receptionist
told
petitioner
she
would
not
be
considered
because
she
was
woman
with
pre-school-age
children,
but
denying
that
they
discriminated
against
her
solely
on
the
grounds
of
her
sex.
thereafter,
respondent
moved
for
summary
judgment,
which
motion
the
district
court
granted
based
on
statistics
that
70,
approximately
75%
of
the
people
hired
as
assembly
trainees
were
women.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
allegation
that
she
was
discriminated
against,
because
she
had
pre-school-age
children,
leaving
standing
then
merely
the
fact
that
was
she
was
discriminated
against
because
she
was
a
woman.
the
district
court,
we
argued
to
the
district
court
sir
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
theory
of
striking
there
was
as
a
matter
of
law,
discrimination
against
a
person
because
of
their
sex-plus,
as
she
being
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children
did
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act.
in
ruling
on
that
the
district
court
specifically
said,
the
responsibilities
of
men
and
women
with
small
children
are
not
the
same
and
employers
are
entitled
to
recognize
those
different
responsibilities
in
establishing
hiring
policies.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
say,
that
it's
not
so.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not
reach
government
as
an
employer.
it
does
however
reach
state
employment
services.
i
don't
--
there
might
be
some
question
at
some
point
of
whether
or
not
that
reaches
government
employment,
but
i
don't
think
so
now.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
if
the
statute
apply,
yes,
but
it
does
not
apply
to
the
federal
judges
of
course.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
the
statue
on
its
face
says
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
federal
government
employment.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
employment
with
the
united
states
government.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir,
you
are
right.
petitioner
appealed
the
district
court's
decision
to
the
fifth
circuit
which
affirmed
and
rather
clearly
announced
a
sex-plus
exemption
to
the
act
of
which
we
find
here.
the
court
held
that
a
per
se
violation
of
the
act
can
only
be
based
solely
on
one
of
the
categories
of
the
act
and
the
petitioner
had
not
been
subjected
to
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
because
here
there
was
a
two
pronged
qualification,
that
is
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children,
or
in
other
words
sex-plus.
thus
the
lower
courts
in
judicially
engrafted
on
the
act
a
further
exception
based
on
sex-plus
and
we
submit
that
this
doctrine
should
be
rejected
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
conflicts
with
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii.
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii
is
to
ensure
that
women,
and
other
protected
categories
are
not
excluded
or
otherwise
hindered
in
their
employment
opportunities
on
the
the
basis
of
stereotypic
assumptions
or
prejudgments
about
their
desirability
as
employees.
rather
the
act
requires
that
an
employer
consider
each
person
on
an
individual
basis
or
present
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
defense.
this
is
of
course
the
defense
that
the
statute
provides.
in
this
case,
the
lower
courts
permitted
respondent
to
exclude
petitioner
based
on
an
unsupported
assumption
about
differences
between
the
normal
relationship
of
working
fathers
and
working
mothers
to
their
pre-school-age
children.
it
would
seem
that
these
differences
are,
that
the
father
goes
out
and
works,
the
mother
stays
home
and
takes
care
of
the
children.
this
we
submit
is
exactly
the
kind
of
stereotypic
assumption,
that
title
vii
is
intended
to
prohibit.
it
is
of
course
true
that
many
women
do
indeed
stay
home
to
take
care
of
the
children,
on
the
other
hand
many
don't.
the
point
of
the
statute
is
that
they
should
be
treated
as
individuals,
rather
than
as
members
of
a
broad
category.
the
second
reason
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
is
that
it
conflicts
with
the
language
of
the
act.
section
703
on
its
face
would
seem
to
prohibit
the
policy
of
refusing
to
hire
women
with
pre-school-age
children
while
at
the
same
time
hiring
men
with
pre-school-age
children,
the
act
declares
that
it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire,
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
with
respect
to
his
terms,
conditions
or
privileges
of
employment
because
of
such
individual's
sex.
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
avoid
this
plain
language
of
the
act,
by
asserting
that
the
act
only
prohibits
discrimination
based
solely
on
one
of
the
categories.
however,
the
senate
by
roll
call
vote
specifically
rejected
an
amendment
which
would
have
inserted
before
each
of
the
enumerations
in
the
act,
the
word
sole.
in
speaking
against
that
amendment,
senator
case,
one
of
the
joint
floor
managers
said
that
such
an
addition
would
completely
vitiate
the
act.
the
sex-plus
doctrine
enunciated
by
the
courts
below
in
this
case,
clearly
illustrates
why
that
is
so.
restricting
the
sex-plus
doctrine
just
to
the
notion
of
women
with
pre-school-age
children.
it
would
exclude,
based
on
a
recent
study
done
by
the
department
of
labor,
4.2
million
women
currently
in
the
labor
force
from
the
protection
of
the
act,
and
allow
solely
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
women
with
pre-school-age
children,
their
employers
to
discriminate
against
them.
this
would
go
far
toward
vitiating
the
act,
but
of
course
the
sex-plus
doctrine
can
easily
be
extended
just
as
to
women.
for
example,
an
employer
could,
under
this
doctrine,
announce
a
decision
to
refuse
to
hire
based
on
sex-plus
marital
status
or
sex-plus
an
age
requirement
i.e.
refuse
to
hire
women
who
are
26
years
of
age
or
over,
or
refuse
to
hire
women
who
are
over
32.
thirdly,
if
the
act
permits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex-plus,
it
would
also
seem
to
permit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
plus,
religion
plus,
or
nationality
plus.
for
example,
an
employer
could
then
refuse
to
hire
negroes
with
chunky
hair,
or
on
the
other
hand
negroes
with
straight
hair.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
it
would
not
follow
automatically,
but
it
is
certainly
a
logical,
rational
application
of
the
very
doctrine.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no.
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
the
doctrine
itself
that
is
a
factor,
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
plus
another
factor,
is
exactly
the
doctrine
announced
of
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
did
note,
and
this
might
be
what
your
honor
is
getting
at,
that
when
an
enumerated
category
of
the
act
is
added
to
--
another
factor
is
added
to
an
enumerated
category
of
the
act
that
the
court
must
look
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
discrimination.
i
suggest
that,
that
is
not
a
substantial
qualification
to
the
blanket
doctrine.
the
blanket
doctrine,
sex-plus
removes
this
seemingly,
facially
--
discrimination
on
its
face
from
the
act.
and
i
think
that's
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
before
directly
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
statute
and
the
language
of
the
act.
congress
engrafted
the
exception
that
it
sought
to
put
onto
the
act
and
when
there
is
something
which
on
its
face
discriminates
against
one
of
the
enumerated
categories,
then
the
initial
inquiry
should
end
right
there.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
just
based
on
that
statement,
your
honor,
no.
that
violates
[voice
overlap]
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
that
violates
title
vii.
of
course
[voice
overlap]
of
course
he
could
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
of
course
is
correct,
your
honor.
no,
if
he
wanted
to
refuse
to
hire
women
who
are
pregnant
or
on
the
basis
of
any
other
physical
disability
that
has
to
do
with
sex,
he
could
present
his
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
but,
if
indeed
women
who
are
pregnant
can
adequately
perform
his
job,
there
is
really
no
reason
why
he
ought
to
be
permitted
to
exclude.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
if
he
raises
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
in
his
defense
and
meets
the
standards
that
the
courts
have
announced
with
respect
to
utilizing
that
defense,
yes.
he
could
avoid
a
--
he
could
successfully
defend
the
case
of
discrimination,
but
he
cannot
use
those
as
a
prejudgment.
if
he
can't
make
out
a
bona
fide
occupational
defense
in
short,
he
must
give
each
women
individual
consideration.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
there
might
be,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
doctrinally,
it
is
exactly
this
case,
it
is
sex-plus
and
doctrinally
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
suggest
that
whenever
there
is
sex-plus,
you
got
to
from
the
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
it
is
on
its
face
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
and
congress
has
said
that,
if
you
want
to
avoid
or
defend
successfully
a
charge
of
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
then
you
have
the
defense
of
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
but
that's
all.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
i
hadn't
thought
of
this
problem
to
date,
your
honor
and
i
don't
see
the
problem
at
all,
i
don't
even
understand
the
suggestion.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
would
note
however
that
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendments
to
the
constitution
cover
government
employment,
and
would
thus
prohibit
the
government
from
discriminating
in
its
employment.
also
there
are
various
regulations
which
the
government
has
promulgated
which
prohibits
discrimination
in
governmental
employment,
specifically
rules
administered
by
the
civil
service
commission
and
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
oh!
i
am
suggesting
that,
but
it
would
not
be
based
on
the
act,
it
would
be
based
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
in
addition
to
the
statutory
intent
and
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
we
also
point
out
that
the
eeoc
has
issued
regulations
which
prohibit
an
employer
from
disqualifying
women
with
pre-school-age
children
on
the
grounds
of
sex-plus.
the
court
below
rejected
these
regulations
by
the
eeoc.
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
should
it
see
if
it
to
reverse,
to
remind
the
circuit
courts
that
agencies
in
charge
with
the
interpretation
and
implementation
of
statute
such
as
title
vii
are
entitled
to
deference
--
that
their
regulations
are
entitled
to
deference
and
that
their
expertise
should
be
given
great
weight.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
decided
on
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that's
correct
and
indeed
there
is
no
evidence
in
it
at
all.
the
district
court
specifically
decided
the
case
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
no
discrimination
is
reached?
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
discrimination
is
reached,
that
discrimination
has
occurred
if
the
exclusion
attaches
on
the
grounds
of
her
sex-plus
affect
another
factor.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
no
distinction,
that's
fine.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
a
decision
of
reversal.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
and
again
we
know
that
all
we
are
thereby
doing
is
instructing
the
court
that
should
it,
the
court
below,
that
should
it
find
after
a
record
has
been
made
that
the
company
indeed
refused
to
consider
women
with
pre-school-age
children,
while
at
the
same
time
hiring
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
there
was
no
defense
of
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
made,
then
there
was
no
defense
on
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
exception
to
act,
then
the
court
below
must
find
discrimination
contrary
to
the
act.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
statute
provides
a
defense
of
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
sir,
that
is,
the
employer
is
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
his
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
his
business.
if
he
can
do
that,
then
the
court
finds
discrimination,
but
finds
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
act
provides
that
defense.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
it
would
not
your
honor,
that
kind
of
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
if
his
distinction
is
going
to
be
based
on
her
sex
then
he
has
no
right
to
make
that
distinction
anymore.
congress
has
said
that,
employers
can
no
longer
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
on
the
other
hand,
if
his
distinction
is
on
the
grounds
that
women
simply
cannot
do
the
job,
and
he
can
prove
that
as
a
defense
under
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
exception
to
the
act,
then
he
would
be
permitted
to
make
that
distinction.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
he
would,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
he
make
that
defense,
yes.
he
cannot
however
contend
that
he
just
doesn't
think
it's
proper
for
women
to
dig
ditches.
congress
has
taken
that
prerogative
from
the
employer,
that
is
to
make
pre-judgments
and
to
make
moral
decisions
or
decisions
about
what
is
proper
on
the
basis
on
sex.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
think
your
honor
that
sex
had
already
been
put
in
when
that
amendment
was
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
when
that
amendment
was
rejected,
i
think
the
sex
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
know
at
what
point
they
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
it
was.
it
was
quite
late,
but
your
honor
we
must
remember
that
when
congress
wrote
the
statute,
they
included
sex
in
the
statute
just
as
they
included
race,
nationality,
and
religion.
and
i
think
in
interpreting
the
statute
as
lawyers
and
judges,
we
should
interpret
the
sex
provisions
just
as
we
do
the
others
irrespective
of
when
it
was
added.
in
summary,
so
that
i
can
reserve
the
rest
of
time
for
the
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
say
that
title
vii
is
one
of
a
number
of
congressional
acts
that
seek
to
eliminate
irrational
all
the
factors
from
being
utilized
as
a
basis
for
employment
and
require
that
employment
policies
be
based
on
rational
factors.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
in
small
parts,
your
honor.
title
vii
seeks
to
prohibit
employment
policies
based
on
stereotypic
assumptions,
pre-judgments,
require
that
applicants
for
employment
be
considered
on
their
individual
merit.
the
act
provides
a
narrow
exception,
not
raised
in
this
case.
only
where
sex
is
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
the
business
by
engrafting
the
further
exception
to
the
act
that
is
sex-plus,
the
courts
below
misconstrued
section
703,
and
their
decision
should
be
reversed.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
female,
that
is
correct.
in
essence
what
congress
has
said
is
that,
you
can
no
longer
have
man
jobs
and
women
jobs
because
that
constitutes,
when
imposed
by
the
employer,
that
constitutes
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
that
is
exactly
what
congress
seems
to
prohibit.
thank
you.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
act
doesn't
specifically
provide
anything
about
giving
women
jobs,
but
the
act
of
course
overall,
your
honor,
does
not
require
any
affirmative
consideration
on
the
grounds
of
a
prohibited
category,
or
if
it
does
it's
only
after
you
prove
a
case
of
discrimination
and
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
remedy.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
thank
you
sir.
i
think
i
will
only
need
two
minutes.
i
merely
wanted
to
point
out
a
couple
of
things.
first,
i
agree
with
mr.
senterfitt
that
the
record
is
very
cloudy,
but
i
suggest
that
we
cannot
simply
accept
on
the
basis
of
this
record
the
suggestion
that
the
company
does
not
in
fact
discriminate,
because
this
company
after
all
did
not
conciliate
the
case
with
the
eeoc
and
it
would
seem
that
there
was
no
discrimination
present,
it
would
be
a
classic
case
for
successful
conciliation
by
the
commission.
then
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
suggest
that
the
legal
issue
here
is
in
fact
squarely
put.
the
district
court
rejected
or
struck
those
portions
of
our
complaint
which
completed
the
legal
theory
that
is
sex-plus
pre-school-age
children
having
struck
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
squarely
puts
the
legal
issue,
but
moreover
in
granting
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
court
specifically
assumed
for
purposes
of
the
record
that
they
hired
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
held
that
immaterial.
as
a
matter
of
law
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
material
proposition
of
law
in
this
case.
this
squarely
puts
the
legal
issue
on
it
and
it
should
give
us
the
opportunity
to
develop
through
discovery
that
legal
issue
and
the
evidence
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir.
what
we
have
involved
in
this
case
your
honor
is,
a
subgroup
of
the
group
women
who
are
also
of
course
as
a
subgroup
of
the
larger
classification
of
women
protected
by
title
vii.
one
further
remark,
mere
statistics
alone
your
honor
i
suggest
will
not
--
mere
statistics
alone
with
respect
to
an
absentee
rate
will
not
establish
it
be
a
(inaudible).
there
would
rather
have
to
be
statistics
with
respect
to
an
absentee
rate
coupled
with
a
strong
showing.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
under
an
appropriate
pronouncement
of
the
law
by
this
court.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
either.[laughter]
mr.
william
l.
robinson
well,
your
honor
on
this
record
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
well,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
you
know
that
in
deciding
this
case
the
district
court
specifically
excepted
the
fact
or
assumed
the
fact,
he
assumed
it,
it
was
not
a
fact.
i
mean,
there
was
no
evidence.
well,
it's
an
assumption
the
basis
of
which
--
on
the
basis
of
which
he
decided
the
case.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
basis
of
his
assumption
was
his
belief
the
law
didn't
prohibit
an
employer
from
the
differencing
between
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
women
with
pre-school-age
children
and
that's
what
squarely
puts
the
issue
your
honor.
it
means
that
we
should
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
that
legal
theory
below.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
with
pre-school-age
children
unless
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
particularly,
that
is
the
comparison,
unless
the
company
can
also
show
that
the
normal
operation
of
their
business
prohibits
them
from
absorbing
that
rate
of
absenteeism.
it's
not
merely
that
there
was
difference,
your
honor.
it's
that
there
is
a
difference
which
is
necessary.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
not
just
significant
hurt,
it
can
no
longer
be
normally
operated,
that's
the
narrow
way
that
congress
intended
this
exemption
to
be
applied.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
it
is.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
of
granting
the
motion
to
strike
and
summary
judgment,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
frankly
would
rather
doubt
it,
because
i
would
imagine
if
the
company
is
admitting
here
today
that
they
already
hire
women
with
pre-school-age
children
that
they
are
not
going
to
seek
to
demonstrate
that
women
with
preschool
age
children
can't
do
the
job.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir,
thank
you.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
case
involves
a
question
of
statutory
construction
of
section
703
(a)
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
section
703
(a)
permits
an
employer
to
refuse
to
hire
women
with
pre-school-age
children,
while
hiring
men
with
pre-school-age
children.
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
standard
or
exemption
to
the
act
under
section
703
(e)
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
standard
which
permits
an
employer
to
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
religion
or
national
origin
if
it
is
a
bona
fide
occupation
qualification.
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that,
it's
not
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
know
whether
it's
agreed
to
both
sides
sir,
but
it
was
not
raised
as
a
defense
below.
we
will
concede,
of
course
your
honor,
that
if
the
case
is
reversed
and
goes
to
a
file
below,
they
would
have
the
opportunity
to
raise
that
defense
then.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
the
dissenters
said
that
the
company
should
have
the
right
to
raise
the
defense,
which
we
of
course
concede.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir,
i
will.
petitioner
mrs.
ida
phillips
is
the
mother
of
7
children,
who
range
in
age
from
3-15
years,
when
she
applied
to
work
with
respondent
martin
marietta
company.
in
september,
1966,
petitioner
applied
for
a
job
with
respondent
as
an
assembly
trainee
in
response
to
its
advertisement
of
100
such
positions.
petitioner
had
a
high
school
diploma,
which
was
the
only
stated
qualification
for
the
job.
however,
respondent
told
her,
that
it
would
not
consider
her
for
the
job
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school
age
children.
thereafter,
petitioner
filed
a
timely
charge,
alleging
discrimination
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children
with
the
eeoc.
the
eeoc
made
a
finding
of
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
refusal
to
hire
her
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children,
constituted
a
violation
of
the
act.
when
the
commission
was
unable
to
obtain
voluntary
compliance,
the
commission
authorized
her
to
file
a
suit,
which
she
did.
after
petitioner
filed
the
suit,
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
which
the
district
court
treated
as
a
motion
to
strike
and
struck
from
petitioner's
claim
--
from
petitioner's
complaint
those
allegations
claiming
that
she
was
discriminated
against
because
she
was
because
she
had
pre-school-age
children.
thereafter,
respondent
answered
the
complaint
admitting
that
its
receptionist
told
petitioner
she
would
not
be
considered
because
she
was
woman
with
pre-school-age
children,
but
denying
that
they
discriminated
against
her
solely
on
the
grounds
of
her
sex.
thereafter,
respondent
moved
for
summary
judgment,
which
motion
the
district
court
granted
based
on
statistics
that
70,
approximately
75%
of
the
people
hired
as
assembly
trainees
were
women.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
allegation
that
she
was
discriminated
against,
because
she
had
pre-school-age
children,
leaving
standing
then
merely
the
fact
that
was
she
was
discriminated
against
because
she
was
a
woman.
the
district
court,
we
argued
to
the
district
court
sir
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
theory
of
striking
there
was
as
a
matter
of
law,
discrimination
against
a
person
because
of
their
sex-plus,
as
she
being
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children
did
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act.
in
ruling
on
that
the
district
court
specifically
said,
the
responsibilities
of
men
and
women
with
small
children
are
not
the
same
and
employers
are
entitled
to
recognize
those
different
responsibilities
in
establishing
hiring
policies.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
say,
that
it's
not
so.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not
reach
government
as
an
employer.
it
does
however
reach
state
employment
services.
i
don't
--
there
might
be
some
question
at
some
point
of
whether
or
not
that
reaches
government
employment,
but
i
don't
think
so
now.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
if
the
statute
apply,
yes,
but
it
does
not
apply
to
the
federal
judges
of
course.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
the
statue
on
its
face
says
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
federal
government
employment.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
employment
with
the
united
states
government.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir,
you
are
right.
petitioner
appealed
the
district
court's
decision
to
the
fifth
circuit
which
affirmed
and
rather
clearly
announced
a
sex-plus
exemption
to
the
act
of
which
we
find
here.
the
court
held
that
a
per
se
violation
of
the
act
can
only
be
based
solely
on
one
of
the
categories
of
the
act
and
the
petitioner
had
not
been
subjected
to
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
because
here
there
was
a
two
pronged
qualification,
that
is
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children,
or
in
other
words
sex-plus.
thus
the
lower
courts
in
judicially
engrafted
on
the
act
a
further
exception
based
on
sex-plus
and
we
submit
that
this
doctrine
should
be
rejected
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
conflicts
with
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii.
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii
is
to
ensure
that
women,
and
other
protected
categories
are
not
excluded
or
otherwise
hindered
in
their
employment
opportunities
on
the
the
basis
of
stereotypic
assumptions
or
prejudgments
about
their
desirability
as
employees.
rather
the
act
requires
that
an
employer
consider
each
person
on
an
individual
basis
or
present
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
defense.
this
is
of
course
the
defense
that
the
statute
provides.
in
this
case,
the
lower
courts
permitted
respondent
to
exclude
petitioner
based
on
an
unsupported
assumption
about
differences
between
the
normal
relationship
of
working
fathers
and
working
mothers
to
their
pre-school-age
children.
it
would
seem
that
these
differences
are,
that
the
father
goes
out
and
works,
the
mother
stays
home
and
takes
care
of
the
children.
this
we
submit
is
exactly
the
kind
of
stereotypic
assumption,
that
title
vii
is
intended
to
prohibit.
it
is
of
course
true
that
many
women
do
indeed
stay
home
to
take
care
of
the
children,
on
the
other
hand
many
don't.
the
point
of
the
statute
is
that
they
should
be
treated
as
individuals,
rather
than
as
members
of
a
broad
category.
the
second
reason
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
is
that
it
conflicts
with
the
language
of
the
act.
section
703
on
its
face
would
seem
to
prohibit
the
policy
of
refusing
to
hire
women
with
pre-school-age
children
while
at
the
same
time
hiring
men
with
pre-school-age
children,
the
act
declares
that
it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire,
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
with
respect
to
his
terms,
conditions
or
privileges
of
employment
because
of
such
individual's
sex.
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
avoid
this
plain
language
of
the
act,
by
asserting
that
the
act
only
prohibits
discrimination
based
solely
on
one
of
the
categories.
however,
the
senate
by
roll
call
vote
specifically
rejected
an
amendment
which
would
have
inserted
before
each
of
the
enumerations
in
the
act,
the
word
sole.
in
speaking
against
that
amendment,
senator
case,
one
of
the
joint
floor
managers
said
that
such
an
addition
would
completely
vitiate
the
act.
the
sex-plus
doctrine
enunciated
by
the
courts
below
in
this
case,
clearly
illustrates
why
that
is
so.
restricting
the
sex-plus
doctrine
just
to
the
notion
of
women
with
pre-school-age
children.
it
would
exclude,
based
on
a
recent
study
done
by
the
department
of
labor,
4.2
million
women
currently
in
the
labor
force
from
the
protection
of
the
act,
and
allow
solely
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
women
with
pre-school-age
children,
their
employers
to
discriminate
against
them.
this
would
go
far
toward
vitiating
the
act,
but
of
course
the
sex-plus
doctrine
can
easily
be
extended
just
as
to
women.
for
example,
an
employer
could,
under
this
doctrine,
announce
a
decision
to
refuse
to
hire
based
on
sex-plus
marital
status
or
sex-plus
an
age
requirement
i.e.
refuse
to
hire
women
who
are
26
years
of
age
or
over,
or
refuse
to
hire
women
who
are
over
32.
thirdly,
if
the
act
permits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex-plus,
it
would
also
seem
to
permit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
plus,
religion
plus,
or
nationality
plus.
for
example,
an
employer
could
then
refuse
to
hire
negroes
with
chunky
hair,
or
on
the
other
hand
negroes
with
straight
hair.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
it
would
not
follow
automatically,
but
it
is
certainly
a
logical,
rational
application
of
the
very
doctrine.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no.
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
the
doctrine
itself
that
is
a
factor,
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
plus
another
factor,
is
exactly
the
doctrine
announced
of
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
did
note,
and
this
might
be
what
your
honor
is
getting
at,
that
when
an
enumerated
category
of
the
act
is
added
to
--
another
factor
is
added
to
an
enumerated
category
of
the
act
that
the
court
must
look
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
discrimination.
i
suggest
that,
that
is
not
a
substantial
qualification
to
the
blanket
doctrine.
the
blanket
doctrine,
sex-plus
removes
this
seemingly,
facially
--
discrimination
on
its
face
from
the
act.
and
i
think
that's
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
before
directly
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
statute
and
the
language
of
the
act.
congress
engrafted
the
exception
that
it
sought
to
put
onto
the
act
and
when
there
is
something
which
on
its
face
discriminates
against
one
of
the
enumerated
categories,
then
the
initial
inquiry
should
end
right
there.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
just
based
on
that
statement,
your
honor,
no.
that
violates
[voice
overlap]
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
that
violates
title
vii.
of
course
[voice
overlap]
of
course
he
could
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
of
course
is
correct,
your
honor.
no,
if
he
wanted
to
refuse
to
hire
women
who
are
pregnant
or
on
the
basis
of
any
other
physical
disability
that
has
to
do
with
sex,
he
could
present
his
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
but,
if
indeed
women
who
are
pregnant
can
adequately
perform
his
job,
there
is
really
no
reason
why
he
ought
to
be
permitted
to
exclude.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
if
he
raises
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
in
his
defense
and
meets
the
standards
that
the
courts
have
announced
with
respect
to
utilizing
that
defense,
yes.
he
could
avoid
a
--
he
could
successfully
defend
the
case
of
discrimination,
but
he
cannot
use
those
as
a
prejudgment.
if
he
can't
make
out
a
bona
fide
occupational
defense
in
short,
he
must
give
each
women
individual
consideration.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
there
might
be,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
doctrinally,
it
is
exactly
this
case,
it
is
sex-plus
and
doctrinally
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
suggest
that
whenever
there
is
sex-plus,
you
got
to
from
the
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
it
is
on
its
face
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
and
congress
has
said
that,
if
you
want
to
avoid
or
defend
successfully
a
charge
of
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
then
you
have
the
defense
of
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
but
that's
all.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
i
hadn't
thought
of
this
problem
to
date,
your
honor
and
i
don't
see
the
problem
at
all,
i
don't
even
understand
the
suggestion.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
would
note
however
that
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendments
to
the
constitution
cover
government
employment,
and
would
thus
prohibit
the
government
from
discriminating
in
its
employment.
also
there
are
various
regulations
which
the
government
has
promulgated
which
prohibits
discrimination
in
governmental
employment,
specifically
rules
administered
by
the
civil
service
commission
and
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
oh!
i
am
suggesting
that,
but
it
would
not
be
based
on
the
act,
it
would
be
based
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
in
addition
to
the
statutory
intent
and
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
we
also
point
out
that
the
eeoc
has
issued
regulations
which
prohibit
an
employer
from
disqualifying
women
with
pre-school-age
children
on
the
grounds
of
sex-plus.
the
court
below
rejected
these
regulations
by
the
eeoc.
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
should
it
see
if
it
to
reverse,
to
remind
the
circuit
courts
that
agencies
in
charge
with
the
interpretation
and
implementation
of
statute
such
as
title
vii
are
entitled
to
deference
--
that
their
regulations
are
entitled
to
deference
and
that
their
expertise
should
be
given
great
weight.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
decided
on
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that's
correct
and
indeed
there
is
no
evidence
in
it
at
all.
the
district
court
specifically
decided
the
case
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
no
discrimination
is
reached?
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
discrimination
is
reached,
that
discrimination
has
occurred
if
the
exclusion
attaches
on
the
grounds
of
her
sex-plus
affect
another
factor.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
no
distinction,
that's
fine.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
a
decision
of
reversal.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
and
again
we
know
that
all
we
are
thereby
doing
is
instructing
the
court
that
should
it,
the
court
below,
that
should
it
find
after
a
record
has
been
made
that
the
company
indeed
refused
to
consider
women
with
pre-school-age
children,
while
at
the
same
time
hiring
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
there
was
no
defense
of
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
made,
then
there
was
no
defense
on
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
exception
to
act,
then
the
court
below
must
find
discrimination
contrary
to
the
act.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
statute
provides
a
defense
of
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
sir,
that
is,
the
employer
is
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
his
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
his
business.
if
he
can
do
that,
then
the
court
finds
discrimination,
but
finds
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
act
provides
that
defense.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
no,
it
would
not
your
honor,
that
kind
of
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
if
his
distinction
is
going
to
be
based
on
her
sex
then
he
has
no
right
to
make
that
distinction
anymore.
congress
has
said
that,
employers
can
no
longer
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
on
the
other
hand,
if
his
distinction
is
on
the
grounds
that
women
simply
cannot
do
the
job,
and
he
can
prove
that
as
a
defense
under
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications
exception
to
the
act,
then
he
would
be
permitted
to
make
that
distinction.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
he
would,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
he
make
that
defense,
yes.
he
cannot
however
contend
that
he
just
doesn't
think
it's
proper
for
women
to
dig
ditches.
congress
has
taken
that
prerogative
from
the
employer,
that
is
to
make
pre-judgments
and
to
make
moral
decisions
or
decisions
about
what
is
proper
on
the
basis
on
sex.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
think
your
honor
that
sex
had
already
been
put
in
when
that
amendment
was
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
when
that
amendment
was
rejected,
i
think
the
sex
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
know
at
what
point
they
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
it
was.
it
was
quite
late,
but
your
honor
we
must
remember
that
when
congress
wrote
the
statute,
they
included
sex
in
the
statute
just
as
they
included
race,
nationality,
and
religion.
and
i
think
in
interpreting
the
statute
as
lawyers
and
judges,
we
should
interpret
the
sex
provisions
just
as
we
do
the
others
irrespective
of
when
it
was
added.
in
summary,
so
that
i
can
reserve
the
rest
of
time
for
the
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
say
that
title
vii
is
one
of
a
number
of
congressional
acts
that
seek
to
eliminate
irrational
all
the
factors
from
being
utilized
as
a
basis
for
employment
and
require
that
employment
policies
be
based
on
rational
factors.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
in
small
parts,
your
honor.
title
vii
seeks
to
prohibit
employment
policies
based
on
stereotypic
assumptions,
pre-judgments,
require
that
applicants
for
employment
be
considered
on
their
individual
merit.
the
act
provides
a
narrow
exception,
not
raised
in
this
case.
only
where
sex
is
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
the
business
by
engrafting
the
further
exception
to
the
act
that
is
sex-plus,
the
courts
below
misconstrued
section
703,
and
their
decision
should
be
reversed.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
female,
that
is
correct.
in
essence
what
congress
has
said
is
that,
you
can
no
longer
have
man
jobs
and
women
jobs
because
that
constitutes,
when
imposed
by
the
employer,
that
constitutes
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
sex,
that
is
exactly
what
congress
seems
to
prohibit.
thank
you.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
act
doesn't
specifically
provide
anything
about
giving
women
jobs,
but
the
act
of
course
overall,
your
honor,
does
not
require
any
affirmative
consideration
on
the
grounds
of
a
prohibited
category,
or
if
it
does
it's
only
after
you
prove
a
case
of
discrimination
and
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
remedy.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
thank
you
sir.
i
think
i
will
only
need
two
minutes.
i
merely
wanted
to
point
out
a
couple
of
things.
first,
i
agree
with
mr.
senterfitt
that
the
record
is
very
cloudy,
but
i
suggest
that
we
cannot
simply
accept
on
the
basis
of
this
record
the
suggestion
that
the
company
does
not
in
fact
discriminate,
because
this
company
after
all
did
not
conciliate
the
case
with
the
eeoc
and
it
would
seem
that
there
was
no
discrimination
present,
it
would
be
a
classic
case
for
successful
conciliation
by
the
commission.
then
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
suggest
that
the
legal
issue
here
is
in
fact
squarely
put.
the
district
court
rejected
or
struck
those
portions
of
our
complaint
which
completed
the
legal
theory
that
is
sex-plus
pre-school-age
children
having
struck
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
squarely
puts
the
legal
issue,
but
moreover
in
granting
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
court
specifically
assumed
for
purposes
of
the
record
that
they
hired
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
held
that
immaterial.
as
a
matter
of
law
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
material
proposition
of
law
in
this
case.
this
squarely
puts
the
legal
issue
on
it
and
it
should
give
us
the
opportunity
to
develop
through
discovery
that
legal
issue
and
the
evidence
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir.
what
we
have
involved
in
this
case
your
honor
is,
a
subgroup
of
the
group
women
who
are
also
of
course
as
a
subgroup
of
the
larger
classification
of
women
protected
by
title
vii.
one
further
remark,
mere
statistics
alone
your
honor
i
suggest
will
not
--
mere
statistics
alone
with
respect
to
an
absentee
rate
will
not
establish
it
be
a
(inaudible).
there
would
rather
have
to
be
statistics
with
respect
to
an
absentee
rate
coupled
with
a
strong
showing.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
under
an
appropriate
pronouncement
of
the
law
by
this
court.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
either.[laughter]
mr.
william
l.
robinson
well,
your
honor
on
this
record
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
well,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
you
know
that
in
deciding
this
case
the
district
court
specifically
excepted
the
fact
or
assumed
the
fact,
he
assumed
it,
it
was
not
a
fact.
i
mean,
there
was
no
evidence.
well,
it's
an
assumption
the
basis
of
which
--
on
the
basis
of
which
he
decided
the
case.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
the
basis
of
his
assumption
was
his
belief
the
law
didn't
prohibit
an
employer
from
the
differencing
between
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
women
with
pre-school-age
children
and
that's
what
squarely
puts
the
issue
your
honor.
it
means
that
we
should
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
that
legal
theory
below.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
with
pre-school-age
children
unless
--
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes,
particularly,
that
is
the
comparison,
unless
the
company
can
also
show
that
the
normal
operation
of
their
business
prohibits
them
from
absorbing
that
rate
of
absenteeism.
it's
not
merely
that
there
was
difference,
your
honor.
it's
that
there
is
a
difference
which
is
necessary.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
not
just
significant
hurt,
it
can
no
longer
be
normally
operated,
that's
the
narrow
way
that
congress
intended
this
exemption
to
be
applied.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
it
is.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
of
granting
the
motion
to
strike
and
summary
judgment,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
frankly
would
rather
doubt
it,
because
i
would
imagine
if
the
company
is
admitting
here
today
that
they
already
hire
women
with
pre-school-age
children
that
they
are
not
going
to
seek
to
demonstrate
that
women
with
preschool
age
children
can't
do
the
job.
mr.
william
l.
robinson
yes
sir,
thank
you.
