mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
martin
marietta
corporation
does
not
have
and
has
never
had
any
such
policy
of
discrimination
as
has
been
suggested
here.
and
this
respondent
does
not
concur
in
the
language
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
had
been
denominated
the
sex
plus
doctrine
or
the
coalescence
principle.
the
statement
attributed
to
a
receptionist,
does
not
and
did
not
reflect
any
sort
of
company
policy
of
discrimination.
rather
the
record,
in
this
case,
shows
that
the
respondent
did
not
practice
discrimination
against
woman
or
anyone
else
in
its
employment
practices
or
procedures.
this
is
highlighted
by
the
the
documentation
in
the
record
which
reflects
the
company's
absolute
policy
of
non-discrimination
and
equal
employment
opportunities,
which
is
consistent
with
its
particular
reputation
as
an
equal
employment
opportunity
and
a
substantial
government
contractor,
particularly
sensitive
to
the
pronouncements
of
the
government
in
this
field.
we
do
however,
vigorously
defend
the
correctness
of
the
result
reached
by
the
district
court
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
affirm
it.
we
consider
it
to
be
elementary,
of
course,
that
a
correct
decision
shouldn't
be
reversibly
because
it
may
have
been
reached
through
an
avenue
of
erroneous
reasoning.
we
would
suppose
that
a
court
reviewing
a
correct
judgment
with
an
incorrect
opinion,
might
have
a
duty
to
enunciate
the
appropriate
reasons
for
the
decision
while
affirming
the
judgment
itself.
the
facts
in
this
case
simply
do
not
justify
escalation
into
a
cause.
the
petitioner
and
her
amici
have
invited
this
court
to
decide
far
more
than
is
necessary
for
an
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case.
there
is
but
a
single
issue
and
the
resolution
of
which
can
appropriately
determine
the
question
of
affirmance
or
reversal
and
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
that
question
is
of
course,
very
simply
and
obviously
whether
the
district
court's
order
for
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
respondent
was
correct.
and
the
sanction
of
course
to
the
determination
of
that
question
is
a
review
of
the
framework
of
the
record
upon
which
the
district
court's
summary
judgment
order
was
entered.
the
essence
of
this
petitioner's
complaint
or
efforts
to
charge
the
respondent
with
a
violation
of
her
rights
under
section
703
(a)
appears
in
the
two
sentences
where
she
said
first,
that
when
she
gave
her
application
to
the
receptionist,
she
was
told,
she
a
woman
was
told
that
her
application
--
that
the
defendant
was
not
considering
applications
from
woman
with
preschool
age
children.
she
followed
this
by
the
general
and
rather
conclusionary
charge
that
the
defendant
refused
to
employ
her
solely
on
account
of
her
sex.
we
think
it
appropriate
to
observe
here.
it'd
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
normal
or
natural
term
for
the
receptionist
to
use
in
addressing
herself
to
the
petitioner,
who
was
a
woman
than
to
use
the
word
women,
in
speaking
to
her.
deluding
any
innuendo
which
it
had
otherwise
might
have
add,
the
petitioner
annexed
to
her
complaint
a
copy
of
the
decision
of
the
eeoc
which
made
no
finding
or
affirmative
assertion
that
the
respondent
treated
women
with
preschool
age
children
differently
than
it
treated
men
similarly
situated.
in
fact,
it
twice
referred
to
the
respondent's
non-consideration
of
people
with
preschool
age
children.
to
the
complaint,
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
motion
to
strike,
a
motion
to
strike
has
no
relevancy
to
this
issue
and
the
court
while
not
granting
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
such,
the
district
court's
order
struck
the
allegation
based
on
a
refusal
to
hire
the
petitioner
because
she
had
preschool
age
children.
now
this
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
that
it
did
not
and
it
does
not
show
that
it
treated
women
with
preschool
age
children
any
differently
than
it
treated
men
with
preschool
age
children
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
for
to
enable
him
to
rule
otherwise
than
as
the
way
he
did.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
have
admitted
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
our
answer
that
the
receptionist
made
the
statement
that
was
alleged.
there
has
been,
we
might
say
appropo
(ph)
to
justice's
inquiry.
there
has
been,
there
was,
as
we
would
develop
in
the
recounting
of
record.
a
request
for
an
admission
was
filed
shortly
before,
just
a
few
days
before
the
hearing
of
the
motions
for
summary
judgment,
in
which
the
petitioner
requested
that
we
admit
that
we,
now
this
for
some
two
years
later,
that
it
now
employs
men
with
preschool
age
children.
now
aside
from
the
irrelevancy
of
the
time
period
involved
because
the
two,
the
relevant
time
of
the
application
was
on
two
years
prior
and
the
request
says
now,
aside
from
that
however,
time
for
responding
had
not
expired
at
the
time
for
the
entry
of
the
motion,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
can
advise
the
court
in
all
candor
that
the
answer
to
it,
if
we
had
answered
it,
would
have
been
yes.
but
also,
that
if
they
had
asked
whether
we
hired
women
with
preschool
age
children
for
the
same
job
at
the
same
time,
the
answer
would
likewise
had
been
yes.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
no,
sir
the
policy
was
exactly
the
same
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
record
for
that
your
honor.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
think,
your
honor,
that
it
was
a
perfectly
natural
thing
for
the
receptionist
in
talking
to
a
woman,
not
to
say
we
don't
hire
men
or
women
with
preschool
age
children,
but
simply
to
say,
we
don't
hire
woman.
now
i
cannot,
i
am
not
undertaking
to
suggest
that
we
have
a
policy
of
not
--
i
don't
--
i
am
not
able
to
explain
the
act,
any
reason
why
this
young
lady
said
this.
we
have
admitted
that
she
said
it
because
we
were
unable
to
prove
that
she
didn't,
but
we
--
certainly
i
am
not
in
any
position
to
say
why.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
know
that
it
was
not
the
policy
to
decline,
to
refuse
to
hire
women
or
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
the
decision
of
the
eeoc
so
reflects
even
though
it
has
no
evidence
of
value
of
course.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
and
that
is
true
now,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
would
say
--
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
pointed
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice,
that
the
record,
the
skimpiness
of
which
we
must
accept
a
degree
of
responsibility
for
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
as
advocates
we
were
--
we
filed
a
motion
and
we
won
it.
it
was
appealed
and
we
won
that
and
that
seems
to
me
our
only
problem
here.
the
skimpiness
of
this
record
doesn't
provide
a
real
basis
for
determining
whether
or
not
this
woman
was
actually
refused
employment.
we
do
have,
in
the
record,
the
affidavit
of
the
manager
of
the
employment
department
who
was
there
and
said
that
no
discrimination
was
there
at
the
relevant
time
and
said
that
no
discrimination
was
practiced
and
the
record
reflects
that
every
possible
effort
in
the
world
had
been
made
to
disseminate
the
requirements
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
to
every
person
that
we
could
conceive
in
the
company
could
possibly
have
any
--
and
the
record
shows
this,
having
in
answers
to
interrogatives.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
well,
not
your
honor,
unless
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
not
unless
if
it
were
considered,
if
it
were
a
--
shall
we
say
per
se
violation
and
unfortunately
the
case
became
confused
in
that
framework
at
a
point.
unless
the
comparisons
were
made
with
men
similarly
situated
with
similar
custodial
problems,
there
were
--
the
record
doesn't
show
what
the
status
of
ida
phillips
was,
with
the
respect
to
custodial
problems.
the
records
shows
nothing
on
that.
well,
we
don't
know
what
the
term
with
pre-school-age
children
meant.
perhaps,
in
that
common
experience
we
might
assume
it
to
mean
what
this
petitioner
apparently
assumes
it
to
mean,
that
is
what
could
mean
though,
simply
the
mother
of
a
child
which
is
under
school
age
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
mother
has
the
custody.
it
is
simply
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
this.
if
it
gives
any
further
light
on
our
position
in
this
regard,
we
have
conceded
that
sex-plus
as
a
concept
is
really.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
thank
your
honor
that
of
course
is
one
way
to
develop
--
that
is
a
way
to
develop
a
fuller
record.
we
think
however
that
the
record
as
it
stood
before
the
district
court
where
there
were
two
questions
before
it
at
that
time
and
the
framework
within
which
the
record
had
been
constructed
where
the
petitioner
had
elected
to
stand
on
the
per
se
issue
and
not
to
produce
any
counter
veiling
affidavits
or
to
introduce
into
the
record
anything
to
show
any
discrimination
or
to
show
that
men
similarly
situated
with
her
custodial
situation
were
treated
differently
than
she.
since
she
elected
to
stand
on
the
per
se
issue,
it
left
the
district
court
with
no
alternative,
but
to
enter
a
summary
judgment
on
the
record
as
it
stood
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
first
of
all
mr.
chief
justice
i
wouldn't
presume
to
tell
this
court
what
it
must
view
this
case,
but
i
am
certain
that
i
am
understand
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
would
say
your
honor
that
the
fact
that
it
does
not
as
such,
and
there
is
no
affirmative
showing
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
difference
in
the
treatment
simply
to
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
hire
pre-school-age
children
or
women
with
pre-school-age
children
without
being
coupled
with
a
comparison
of
the
treatment
of
men
similarly
situated.
it
does
not
constitute
an
allegation
of
violation
under
the
act.
and
insofar
as
sustaining
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
they
would
have
the
alternative,
this
same
alternative
that
this
court
has.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
your
honor,
ten
of
them
decided
that
it
shouldn't
be.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
ten
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
it
should
not
be.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
but
they
had
the
alternatives.
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals,
it
had
the
same
view
of
the
law
as
the
petitioner
and
which
we
concede
has
some
merits.
it
would
have
to
determine
then
whether
or
not
it
felt
that
the
district
court
on
the
record
before
was
correct
in
entering
summary
judgment,
not
whether
or
not
martin
marietta
tried
to
discriminate.
that's
the
per
se
issue
and
that's
where
the
case
became
all
confused.
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
certainly,
if
it's
appropriate
at
the
time
your
honor
and
under
the
circumstances,
if
it
should
be
remanded
for
the
development
of
a
fuller
record,
then
we
should
have
the
opportunity.
if
it's
considered
appropriate
at
that
time.
i
may
say,
however,
that
this
is
sort
of
an
aside
to
mr.
justice
black's
query
that
they
are
governmentally
published
statistics
which
show
that
women
with
pre-school-age
children
have
a
higher
incidence
of
absentee
or
as
it
would
appear
to.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
if
the
court
please,
we
feel
that
our
position
on
this
is
that
this
record
in
its
truncated
posture,
is
not
one
that
really
affords
the
basis
of
speculating
on
what
we
might
be
able
to
do
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
your
honor,
certainly
i
believe
that
it
seemed
to
be
appropriate
at
that
time,
if
it
should
be
remanded.
if
the
district
court
should
first
find
that
we
have
discriminated
under
the
act,
then
certainly
to
the
extent
that
the
business
necessity
doctrine
would
be
available
to
us
as
a
defendant,
defense
would
be
asserted
vigorously.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
did
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
did
not
mr.
justice
marshall
intend
to
suggest
that
government
studies
show,
but
that
government
published
statistics
and
i
cited
in
our
brief
in
footnote
4
on
page
28.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
have
not
seen
any
your
honor.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
think
not.
i
think
that
it
seems
to
be
a
general
assumption.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
my
understanding
that
the
figures
refer
to
indicating
a
higher
incidence
than
those
i've
meat.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
have
to
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
but
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
yeah,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
three
of
them.
yes,
that's
correct
sir.
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
i
had
joined
in
the
opinion.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
yes
sir.
having
our
discussion
on
the
state
of
the
record
fairly
well
preempted
and
concluded
through
the
questioning
rather
than
through
a
narrative.
we
would
simply
reiterate
that
our
position
on
this
part
is
that
there
was
simply
nothing
in
the
record
before
the
district
court,
under
which
or
upon
which
it
could
rule
any
other
way
than
it
did
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
on
our
point
on
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
we
would
simply
say
that
for
the
reasons
that
are
amplified
in
our
brief,
we
suggest
that
the
petitioners
failed
to
comply
with
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
the
statute
with
respect
of
the
timeliness
filing
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
would
thank
the
court.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
the
job
your
honor
is
an
assembly
line
requiring
shift
work.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
of
small
electronic
components
that
would
become
ultimate
a
part
of
a
missile
under
the
martin
marietta's
defense
contract
work.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
think
on
the
contrary
your
honor
that
it
is
intricate
work
and
not
heavy
work.
it
is
not
a
heavy
assembly
type
of
thing.
these
are
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
this
could
be
a
very
well
become
a
valid
reason.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
am
so
pleased
i
couldn't
say
that
because
it
appears
to
fall
into
this
stereotype
preconception
concept
that
the
commission
sees.[laughter]
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
think
that
it
appeals
to
reason.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
martin
marietta
corporation
does
not
have
and
has
never
had
any
such
policy
of
discrimination
as
has
been
suggested
here.
and
this
respondent
does
not
concur
in
the
language
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
had
been
denominated
the
sex
plus
doctrine
or
the
coalescence
principle.
the
statement
attributed
to
a
receptionist,
does
not
and
did
not
reflect
any
sort
of
company
policy
of
discrimination.
rather
the
record,
in
this
case,
shows
that
the
respondent
did
not
practice
discrimination
against
woman
or
anyone
else
in
its
employment
practices
or
procedures.
this
is
highlighted
by
the
the
documentation
in
the
record
which
reflects
the
company's
absolute
policy
of
non-discrimination
and
equal
employment
opportunities,
which
is
consistent
with
its
particular
reputation
as
an
equal
employment
opportunity
and
a
substantial
government
contractor,
particularly
sensitive
to
the
pronouncements
of
the
government
in
this
field.
we
do
however,
vigorously
defend
the
correctness
of
the
result
reached
by
the
district
court
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
affirm
it.
we
consider
it
to
be
elementary,
of
course,
that
a
correct
decision
shouldn't
be
reversibly
because
it
may
have
been
reached
through
an
avenue
of
erroneous
reasoning.
we
would
suppose
that
a
court
reviewing
a
correct
judgment
with
an
incorrect
opinion,
might
have
a
duty
to
enunciate
the
appropriate
reasons
for
the
decision
while
affirming
the
judgment
itself.
the
facts
in
this
case
simply
do
not
justify
escalation
into
a
cause.
the
petitioner
and
her
amici
have
invited
this
court
to
decide
far
more
than
is
necessary
for
an
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case.
there
is
but
a
single
issue
and
the
resolution
of
which
can
appropriately
determine
the
question
of
affirmance
or
reversal
and
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
that
question
is
of
course,
very
simply
and
obviously
whether
the
district
court's
order
for
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
respondent
was
correct.
and
the
sanction
of
course
to
the
determination
of
that
question
is
a
review
of
the
framework
of
the
record
upon
which
the
district
court's
summary
judgment
order
was
entered.
the
essence
of
this
petitioner's
complaint
or
efforts
to
charge
the
respondent
with
a
violation
of
her
rights
under
section
703
(a)
appears
in
the
two
sentences
where
she
said
first,
that
when
she
gave
her
application
to
the
receptionist,
she
was
told,
she
a
woman
was
told
that
her
application
--
that
the
defendant
was
not
considering
applications
from
woman
with
preschool
age
children.
she
followed
this
by
the
general
and
rather
conclusionary
charge
that
the
defendant
refused
to
employ
her
solely
on
account
of
her
sex.
we
think
it
appropriate
to
observe
here.
it'd
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
normal
or
natural
term
for
the
receptionist
to
use
in
addressing
herself
to
the
petitioner,
who
was
a
woman
than
to
use
the
word
women,
in
speaking
to
her.
deluding
any
innuendo
which
it
had
otherwise
might
have
add,
the
petitioner
annexed
to
her
complaint
a
copy
of
the
decision
of
the
eeoc
which
made
no
finding
or
affirmative
assertion
that
the
respondent
treated
women
with
preschool
age
children
differently
than
it
treated
men
similarly
situated.
in
fact,
it
twice
referred
to
the
respondent's
non-consideration
of
people
with
preschool
age
children.
to
the
complaint,
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
motion
to
strike,
a
motion
to
strike
has
no
relevancy
to
this
issue
and
the
court
while
not
granting
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
such,
the
district
court's
order
struck
the
allegation
based
on
a
refusal
to
hire
the
petitioner
because
she
had
preschool
age
children.
now
this
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
that
it
did
not
and
it
does
not
show
that
it
treated
women
with
preschool
age
children
any
differently
than
it
treated
men
with
preschool
age
children
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
for
to
enable
him
to
rule
otherwise
than
as
the
way
he
did.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
have
admitted
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
our
answer
that
the
receptionist
made
the
statement
that
was
alleged.
there
has
been,
we
might
say
appropo
(ph)
to
justice's
inquiry.
there
has
been,
there
was,
as
we
would
develop
in
the
recounting
of
record.
a
request
for
an
admission
was
filed
shortly
before,
just
a
few
days
before
the
hearing
of
the
motions
for
summary
judgment,
in
which
the
petitioner
requested
that
we
admit
that
we,
now
this
for
some
two
years
later,
that
it
now
employs
men
with
preschool
age
children.
now
aside
from
the
irrelevancy
of
the
time
period
involved
because
the
two,
the
relevant
time
of
the
application
was
on
two
years
prior
and
the
request
says
now,
aside
from
that
however,
time
for
responding
had
not
expired
at
the
time
for
the
entry
of
the
motion,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
can
advise
the
court
in
all
candor
that
the
answer
to
it,
if
we
had
answered
it,
would
have
been
yes.
but
also,
that
if
they
had
asked
whether
we
hired
women
with
preschool
age
children
for
the
same
job
at
the
same
time,
the
answer
would
likewise
had
been
yes.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
no,
sir
the
policy
was
exactly
the
same
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
record
for
that
your
honor.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
think,
your
honor,
that
it
was
a
perfectly
natural
thing
for
the
receptionist
in
talking
to
a
woman,
not
to
say
we
don't
hire
men
or
women
with
preschool
age
children,
but
simply
to
say,
we
don't
hire
woman.
now
i
cannot,
i
am
not
undertaking
to
suggest
that
we
have
a
policy
of
not
--
i
don't
--
i
am
not
able
to
explain
the
act,
any
reason
why
this
young
lady
said
this.
we
have
admitted
that
she
said
it
because
we
were
unable
to
prove
that
she
didn't,
but
we
--
certainly
i
am
not
in
any
position
to
say
why.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
know
that
it
was
not
the
policy
to
decline,
to
refuse
to
hire
women
or
men
with
pre-school-age
children
and
the
decision
of
the
eeoc
so
reflects
even
though
it
has
no
evidence
of
value
of
course.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
and
that
is
true
now,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
would
say
--
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
pointed
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice,
that
the
record,
the
skimpiness
of
which
we
must
accept
a
degree
of
responsibility
for
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
as
advocates
we
were
--
we
filed
a
motion
and
we
won
it.
it
was
appealed
and
we
won
that
and
that
seems
to
me
our
only
problem
here.
the
skimpiness
of
this
record
doesn't
provide
a
real
basis
for
determining
whether
or
not
this
woman
was
actually
refused
employment.
we
do
have,
in
the
record,
the
affidavit
of
the
manager
of
the
employment
department
who
was
there
and
said
that
no
discrimination
was
there
at
the
relevant
time
and
said
that
no
discrimination
was
practiced
and
the
record
reflects
that
every
possible
effort
in
the
world
had
been
made
to
disseminate
the
requirements
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
to
every
person
that
we
could
conceive
in
the
company
could
possibly
have
any
--
and
the
record
shows
this,
having
in
answers
to
interrogatives.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
well,
not
your
honor,
unless
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
not
unless
if
it
were
considered,
if
it
were
a
--
shall
we
say
per
se
violation
and
unfortunately
the
case
became
confused
in
that
framework
at
a
point.
unless
the
comparisons
were
made
with
men
similarly
situated
with
similar
custodial
problems,
there
were
--
the
record
doesn't
show
what
the
status
of
ida
phillips
was,
with
the
respect
to
custodial
problems.
the
records
shows
nothing
on
that.
well,
we
don't
know
what
the
term
with
pre-school-age
children
meant.
perhaps,
in
that
common
experience
we
might
assume
it
to
mean
what
this
petitioner
apparently
assumes
it
to
mean,
that
is
what
could
mean
though,
simply
the
mother
of
a
child
which
is
under
school
age
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
mother
has
the
custody.
it
is
simply
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
this.
if
it
gives
any
further
light
on
our
position
in
this
regard,
we
have
conceded
that
sex-plus
as
a
concept
is
really.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
thank
your
honor
that
of
course
is
one
way
to
develop
--
that
is
a
way
to
develop
a
fuller
record.
we
think
however
that
the
record
as
it
stood
before
the
district
court
where
there
were
two
questions
before
it
at
that
time
and
the
framework
within
which
the
record
had
been
constructed
where
the
petitioner
had
elected
to
stand
on
the
per
se
issue
and
not
to
produce
any
counter
veiling
affidavits
or
to
introduce
into
the
record
anything
to
show
any
discrimination
or
to
show
that
men
similarly
situated
with
her
custodial
situation
were
treated
differently
than
she.
since
she
elected
to
stand
on
the
per
se
issue,
it
left
the
district
court
with
no
alternative,
but
to
enter
a
summary
judgment
on
the
record
as
it
stood
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
first
of
all
mr.
chief
justice
i
wouldn't
presume
to
tell
this
court
what
it
must
view
this
case,
but
i
am
certain
that
i
am
understand
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
would
say
your
honor
that
the
fact
that
it
does
not
as
such,
and
there
is
no
affirmative
showing
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
difference
in
the
treatment
simply
to
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
hire
pre-school-age
children
or
women
with
pre-school-age
children
without
being
coupled
with
a
comparison
of
the
treatment
of
men
similarly
situated.
it
does
not
constitute
an
allegation
of
violation
under
the
act.
and
insofar
as
sustaining
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
they
would
have
the
alternative,
this
same
alternative
that
this
court
has.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
your
honor,
ten
of
them
decided
that
it
shouldn't
be.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
ten
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
it
should
not
be.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
but
they
had
the
alternatives.
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals,
it
had
the
same
view
of
the
law
as
the
petitioner
and
which
we
concede
has
some
merits.
it
would
have
to
determine
then
whether
or
not
it
felt
that
the
district
court
on
the
record
before
was
correct
in
entering
summary
judgment,
not
whether
or
not
martin
marietta
tried
to
discriminate.
that's
the
per
se
issue
and
that's
where
the
case
became
all
confused.
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
certainly,
if
it's
appropriate
at
the
time
your
honor
and
under
the
circumstances,
if
it
should
be
remanded
for
the
development
of
a
fuller
record,
then
we
should
have
the
opportunity.
if
it's
considered
appropriate
at
that
time.
i
may
say,
however,
that
this
is
sort
of
an
aside
to
mr.
justice
black's
query
that
they
are
governmentally
published
statistics
which
show
that
women
with
pre-school-age
children
have
a
higher
incidence
of
absentee
or
as
it
would
appear
to.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
if
the
court
please,
we
feel
that
our
position
on
this
is
that
this
record
in
its
truncated
posture,
is
not
one
that
really
affords
the
basis
of
speculating
on
what
we
might
be
able
to
do
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
your
honor,
certainly
i
believe
that
it
seemed
to
be
appropriate
at
that
time,
if
it
should
be
remanded.
if
the
district
court
should
first
find
that
we
have
discriminated
under
the
act,
then
certainly
to
the
extent
that
the
business
necessity
doctrine
would
be
available
to
us
as
a
defendant,
defense
would
be
asserted
vigorously.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
did
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
did
not
mr.
justice
marshall
intend
to
suggest
that
government
studies
show,
but
that
government
published
statistics
and
i
cited
in
our
brief
in
footnote
4
on
page
28.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
have
not
seen
any
your
honor.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
think
not.
i
think
that
it
seems
to
be
a
general
assumption.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
my
understanding
that
the
figures
refer
to
indicating
a
higher
incidence
than
those
i've
meat.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
have
to
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
but
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
yeah,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
three
of
them.
yes,
that's
correct
sir.
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
i
had
joined
in
the
opinion.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
yes
sir.
having
our
discussion
on
the
state
of
the
record
fairly
well
preempted
and
concluded
through
the
questioning
rather
than
through
a
narrative.
we
would
simply
reiterate
that
our
position
on
this
part
is
that
there
was
simply
nothing
in
the
record
before
the
district
court,
under
which
or
upon
which
it
could
rule
any
other
way
than
it
did
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
on
our
point
on
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
we
would
simply
say
that
for
the
reasons
that
are
amplified
in
our
brief,
we
suggest
that
the
petitioners
failed
to
comply
with
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
the
statute
with
respect
of
the
timeliness
filing
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
would
thank
the
court.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
the
job
your
honor
is
an
assembly
line
requiring
shift
work.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
of
small
electronic
components
that
would
become
ultimate
a
part
of
a
missile
under
the
martin
marietta's
defense
contract
work.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
think
on
the
contrary
your
honor
that
it
is
intricate
work
and
not
heavy
work.
it
is
not
a
heavy
assembly
type
of
thing.
these
are
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
this
could
be
a
very
well
become
a
valid
reason.
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
i
am
so
pleased
i
couldn't
say
that
because
it
appears
to
fall
into
this
stereotype
preconception
concept
that
the
commission
sees.[laughter]
mr.
donald
t.
senterfitt
we
think
that
it
appeals
to
reason.
