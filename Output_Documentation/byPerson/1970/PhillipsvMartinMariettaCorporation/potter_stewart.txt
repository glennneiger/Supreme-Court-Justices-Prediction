do
you
think
that
an
employer
could
have
a
policy
of
refusing
to
hire
expectant

does
hire
expectant

women
who

in
other

justice

sex-plus
or
some
things
that
only

be?[laughter]
justice

stewart
the
record
shows
that
75-80%
of
assembly
trainees
are
women.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
could
an
airline
decide
that
they
only
wanted
to
have
the
job
position
of
stewardess,
that
it
didn’t
want
to
have
a
job,
position
of
steward?
justice
potter
stewart
well
back
in
a
days
when
railroad
trains
were
still
running,
and
the
pullman
company
decided
they
only
wanted
porters,
and
didn't
want
porteresses?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
has
commission
taken
a
position
on
that,
on
the
stewardesses?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
isn't
a
litigation,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
you
envision
or
hypothesize
as
the
kind
of
a
case
that
could
be
made
to
justify
this,
statistical
evidence
that
absenteeism
and
so
on
had
been
very
much
worse
in
that
sub-group?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

an
example
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
quite
apart
from
policy,
if
this
applicant
was
in
fact,
not
considered
for
employment,
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school
children,
then
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act,
wasn't
there?
quite
apart
from
the
policy
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
somebody
the
company
just
didn't
know,
didn't
get
the
word
or
misunderstood
what
the
policy
was,
and
if
this
woman,
in
fact,
was
denied
consideration
as
an
employee
on
that
ground,
then
there
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
rights,
wasn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
because
your
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
do
i
understand
that
you,
what
you
agree
that
if
regardless
of
all
these
good
faith
efforts
and
if
--
and
regardless
of
what
the
company's
policy
was,
if
regardless
of
both
of
all
of
those
things,
if
this
woman,
in
fact,
was
--
if
her
application
was
to
refused
consideration
because
she
was
a
woman
with
pre-school-age
children
at
a
time
when
the
company
was
hiring
men
with
pre-school-age
children,
then
her
individual
rights
were
violated
under
the
act,
you
concede
that
or
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
because
understood
you
say
that
you
virtually
concede
that
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error?
justice
potter
stewart
only
under
the
statute
--
well,
then
i
would
infer
perhaps
for
some
tactical
reason
you
want
to
--
probably
agree
with
me
and
i
don't
except
you
to,
but
by
the
inference
i
gather
from
your
argument
is
that
you
pretty
well
agree
with
your
advisory
that
this
judgment
ought
to
be
set
aside
and
the
case
remanded
for
a
trial
on
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
had
the
wrong
view
of
the
law
as
you
concede,
as
i
understand
you
not
to
concede?
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
are
suggesting
mr.
robinson
that,
it
wouldn't
be
enough
as
a
defense
for
the
employer
had
to
show
statistical
data
indicating
significantly
higher
absentee
rate
or
accident
rate
for
women
with
pre-school-age
children
as
distinguished
from
other
men
and
women?
justice
potter
stewart
or
particularly
as
distinguished
from
men
with
pre-school-age
children,
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
a
significant
impact
on
a
business
operation
such
as
that
an
assembly
line
operation
is
significantly
hurt
by
absenteeism
or
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
rather
collateral
to
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
an
