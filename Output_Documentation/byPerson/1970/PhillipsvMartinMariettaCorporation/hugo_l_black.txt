it
doesn't
apply
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
defense
does
the
statute
provide
that
can
be
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
company
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
digging
ditches,
digging
construction
work
all
over
the
country,
and
that
man
declined
to
hire
women
because
he
somehow
had
ended
up
to
the
hired
women
to
dig
ditches,
would
that
be
a
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
requires
that
the
employer
give
the
women
a
job
of
digging
ditches
and
things
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
absolute
requirement?

black
but
could
he
–-
would
he
be
permitted
to
try
to
defend?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
ditch
digging,
on
the
ground
women
just
can't
dig
ditches
as
well
as
man?
justice

he
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
this
provide
anything
about
discrimination
in
giving
women
jobs
or
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
any
company
have
any
women
employed
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet
they
refused
to
hire
these
because
they
are
women?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
the
only
issue
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
contended
and
i
heard
somebody
use
the
word
rational,
that
a
decision
of
that
guy
not
to
employ
women,
who
have
children
in
pre-school
age,
is
irrational?
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
used
the
word,
i
was
trying
to
get
it
(inaudible)
that
connection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
male
stewards
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
do
you
have
a
name?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
only
one
out
of
five?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
hold
about
the
baseball
player?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
women
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
an
airline
has
a
man
come
up
and
apply
to
be
a
stewardess,
i
mean
a
steward,
take
the
place
of
a
stewardess,
they
tell
him
that
customers
like
women
better
in
that
place,
younger
women
obviously.
would
that
be
a
good
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
suppose
the
case
was
reversed
and
sent
back
to
court
and
assume
also
that
you
are
not
defending
on
the
ground
that
because
of
mother,
it
could
be
the
reason
of
mother
not
to
get
a
job,
but
it
might
still
we
know
the
reason
why
the
husband
should,
suppose
you
get
all
of
it?
do
you
think
you
would
have
any
showing
by
statistics
or
by
anything
else
that
the
practice
of
not
hiring
mothers
with
the
pre-school-age
children
was
necessary
to
carry
on
your
business
in
an
orderly
fashion,
or
would
you
attempt
it?
are
you
saying
if
you
ought
to
have
that
chance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
do
you
(voice
overlap)
that
as
a
defense
or
is
it
an
automatic
thing
with
regard
to
business
or
anything
else,
you
did
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
maybe
you're
putting
up
as
a
defense
and
hoped
(inaudible)
that
the
rule
is
a
good
one.
from
a
business
standpoint
it
could
throw
the
business
out
of
the
shape,
out
of
(inaudible)
and
that
you
want
the
chance
to
prove
by
statistics
or
whatever
you
can
at
that
that's
a
reasonable
rule,
and
that
it
should
not
be
--
you
should
be
not
held
liable
on
that
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
common
sense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question.
i
have
been
curious
for
that,
i
am
not
able
to
get
it.
what
is
this
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assembling
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
is
it
the
extra-heavy
or
an
anything?
why
either
one
should
have
any
preference
man
or
woman?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
a
reason
why
you
should
have
any
desire
to
have
one
instead
of
the
other,
unless
it
would
be
that
a
woman
might
be
absent
for
when
they
have
babies?
justice

as
i

you
are
