mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
case
under
title
vii,
the
equal
employment
opportunities
provision
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
to
be
argued
before
this
court.
and
for
that
reason
as
well
as
reasons
reflected
in
the
statistics
about
working
mothers,
reproduced
in
our
brief,
the
united
states
believes
the
case
to
be
an
important
one.
before
proceeding
to
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
make
one
correction
of
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
the
case
last
april.
we
stated
in
that
brief
that
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
stated
it
both
on
pages
2
and
3,
and
again
on
page
4,
but
we
are
informed
by
counsel
for
the
parties
that
no
such
petition
was
filed.
we
regret
our
error
about
this
which
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
under
its
own
rule
treated
the
request
by
one
of
the
members
of
that
court
for
reconsideration
of
the
panel
decision
as
a
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
my
knowledge,
but
there
is
a
specific
rule
about
it
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
denial
of
the
rehearing
en
banc,
you
will
note
in
the
record
that
denial
begins
with
the
statement
on
page
42
a
of
the
record.
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
denied
and
the
court
having
been
polled
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
and
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
not
having
voted
in
favor
of
it,
rehearing
en
banc
is
also
denied.
now,
i
mentioned
this
correction
because
of
the
respondent's
contention
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
untimely.
we
believe
along
with
the
petitioner
that
the
petition
is
timely
for
reasons
--
substantially
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
if
the
court
is
satisfied,
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
as
already
recounted,
the
summary
judgment
in
this
case
was
based
on
the
factual
parenthesis,
partly
assumed
by
the
district
court
that
the
respondent
excludes
men
but
not
women
--
excludes
women
but
not
men,
i
am
sorry,
that
the
respondent
excludes
women
but
not
men
with
pre-school
aged
children
from
employment
as
assembly
trainees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
to
be
trained
to
work
on
the
assembly
lines,
as
far
as
i
know
the
record
doesn’t
specify
what
the
job
is,
they
keep
referring
to
it
as
assembly
trainee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
doesn’t
--
i
am
sure
counsel
for
martin
marietta
could
tell
you,
i
mean
record
doesn't
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
there
is
a
affidavit,
that
is
un-contradicted
that
75
to
80%
of
them
are
women.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
a
higher
percentage
of
women
than
of
men
who
apply
are
hired
for
the
job
and
that
is
essentially
all
the
record
there
was,
other
than
the
complaint
and
the
answer
and
the
district
judge's
assumption
that
martin
marietta
did
hire
men
with
pre-school
aged
children
for
this
job.
since
this
is
the
first
case
under
title
vii,
i
might
say
for
purposes
of
clarity
that
in
our
view
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
quite
uniformly
agreed
with
this,
a
suit
of
this
kind
of
a
de
novo
proceeding
completely.
the
only
record
is
the
record
made
in
court,
this
is
not
a
review
of
administrative
decision,
and
there
is
no
administrative
record
being
reviewed
in
this
kind
of
a
suit,
even
though
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
had
investigated
this
compliant,
and
had
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
certainly
does,
in
fact
most
of
the
people
employed
in
this
job
are
women.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
they
have
--
because
their
women
with
pre-school
aged
children,
because
they
have
little
children,
they
won’t
hire
any
women
with
little
children.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
only
issue
is
whether
they
can
hire
men
with
little
children,
but
refuse
to
hire
women
with
little
children.
the
complainant
here
is
that
it
doesn’t
benefit
her
very
much
if
they
hire
other
women,
they
won’t
hire
her
even
though
they
will
hire
men
in
the
same
situation.
it
doesn't
benefit
the
children
who
depend
on
her
for
support
either,
that
they
are
willing
to
hire
other
women.
she
needs
the
job
and
that’s
with
her
complaint
was
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
and
that’s
what
her
complaint
is
in
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don’t
contend
that
it
is
irrational,
we
contend
that
it’s
illegal.
congress
made
a
judgment
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
many
things
that
are
illegal
may
not
be
irrational.
now
in
our
view,
the
courts
below
erred
in
holding
that
what
had
been
alleged
and
assumed
here
was
not
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
it
was
a
qualification
for
employment
applied
to
members
of
one
sex
and
not
the
other.
and
therefore,
on
its
face
which
is
all
that
we
have
here,
there
was
no
attempt
to
justify
it,
the
requirement
is
no
less
a
forbidden
discrimination
then
would
be
a
state
voting
qualification
requirement,
that
said
that
men
with
pre-school
age
children
could
vote,
the
women
with
pre-school
age
children
couldn’t
vote.
could
there
be
any
doubt
as
to
whether
that
violates
the
nineteenth
amendment.
in
other
words,
the
error
to
us
is
a
very
basic
one
of
not
recognizing
what
it
is
that
constitutes
a
discrimination.
you
don’t
have
to
exclude
all
women
in
order
to
be
discriminating
against
women,
when
you
exclude
some
of
them
on
grounds
that
aren’t
used
to
exclude
men.
that’s
in
essence
what
this
case
is
about,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
itself
apparently
recognized
that
its
sex
plus
standard
is
not
a
viable
age
interpret
the
act.
in
a
recent
decision
of
theirs,
which
to
our
way
of
thinking
backs
away
quite
considerably
from
this
phillip’s
decision
and
this
is
an
addition
that
we
should
make
to
our
brief.
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
we
refer
at
the
end
of
the
lengthy
footnote
on
that
page,
this
is
page
12
of
our
brief,
to
a
district
court
decision
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
called
lansdale
against
the
united
airlines
company.
and
there
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
martin
marietta,
quite
understandably
the
district
judge
held,
he
was
sitting
there
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
it
was
no
violation
of
the
act
for
the
airline
company
to
fire
its
stewardesses
when
they
got
married,
even
though
it
continued
to
employ
its
male
stewards
after
they
were
married.
it
was
sex
plus
and
the
fifth
circuit,
it
said
it
doesn't
violate
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
have
both
male
stewards
and
female
stewardesses,
and
when
they
get
married,
the
women
are
fired
but
the
men
are
allowed
to
continue
in
their
jobs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
on
august
13
of
this
year,
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
little
per
curiam
decision
reversed
this
lansdale
case
and
held,
this
is
case
number
29410
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
29410
decide
on
august
13
of
this
year
after
our
brief
was
filed,
and
they
said
a
little
per
curiam
opinion,
that
the
phillips
case
provided
no
authority
for
the
decision,
but
they
didn’t
explain
why
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
cases
also
called
lansdale
against
the
united
airlines
company.
it's
the
same
name
as
in
their
footnote.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
litigation
about
that
in
a
lower
courts
now,
as
to
whether
they
have
been
able
to
establish
a
defense
under
the
act,
under
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense,
and
this
is
a
matter
that
has
being
litigated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
this
is
the
kind
of
decision
that
now
has
to
be
justified
as
a
matter
relating
to
the
business
needs
of
the
company
or
else
it
can
no
more
be
done
than
could
--
it
can
no
more
be
perpetuated
than
a
decision
that
you
prefer
to
hire
whites
and
not
blacks.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
couldn't
say
with
authority.
my
belief
is
that
the
commission
has
opposed
that
a
discrimination,
but
i
couldn't
say
for
sure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
an
affirmative
not
from
one
of
the
commission
lawyers
that
the
commission
has
been
opposing
that
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
a
five-member
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
well,
one
i
am
told
--
well,
not
only
has
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
not
--
[attempt
to
laughter]
they
have
been
appointed
by
the
president.[laughter]
not
only
has
the
fifth
circuit
in
our
view
backed
away
from
the
rationale
of
this
decision,
but
as
we
read
its
brief
in
this
court
the
respondent
doesn't
itself
contend
that
the
broad
holding
of
the
court
allow
should
be
sustained
on
the
merits,
and
it’s
suggests
instead
that
a
more
fully
developed
record
might
show
that
its
refusal
to
hire
the
petitioner
didn't
violate
title
vii.
well,
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
what
prevented
development
of
the
record
was
the
erroneous
granting
of
the
summary
judgment
prematurely,
and
that
a
reversal
and
remand
of
the
case
that
called
for
and
on
that
premise,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
how
some
of
the
respondent's
suggestions
about
development
of
the
record
seemed
us
to
bear
on
the
issues
to
be
resolved
on
remand.
one
suggestion
is
that,
what
the
receptionist
told
the
petitioner
may
not
have
accurately
reflected
the
company's
policy.
now,
that
possibility
might
affect
whether
an
injunction
should
be
granted
or
what
the
terms
of
the
injunction
should
be,
but
it
would
not
in
our
view,
be
a
defense
to
the
charge
of
discrimination
against
the
petitioner
herself.
her
right
to
relief
under
the
act
does
not
depend
on
whether
there
has
been
a
pattern
or
general
practice
of
discrimination.
section
703
of
the
act,
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
2,
on
which
she
relies,
specifically
forbids
discrimination
against
“any
individual”
on
account
of
sex.
and
if
that
probation
is
to
be
effective
employers
must
be
held
responsible
of
the
acts
of
their
agents,
who
have
apparent
authority
to
reject
employment
applicants.
petitioner's
only
contact
was
with
the
receptionist.
there
was
no
other
spokesman
of
company
policy
for
her
and
the
company
never
undertook
to
resend
the
receptionist
rejection
of
her
employment
application.
so,
the
practical,
sensible
way
to
apply
the
statute
in
our
view
is
to
look
at
the
situation
realistically
from
the
standpoint
of
the
person
and
upon
whom
the
statute
confers
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
did
in
applying
a
similar
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
in
boynton
against
virginia,
in
volume
364
u.s.
the
court
there
held,
that
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
nondiscriminatory
service
in
a
bus
terminal
restaurant,
even
though
the
record
did
not
show
whether
the
restaurant
was
owned
or
controlled
by
a
carrier.
it
was
enough
that
the
terminal
and
the
restaurant
operated
as
an
integral
part
of
the
carrier's
transportation
service
for
interstate
passengers
and
in
those
circumstances
the
court
said,
“an
interstate
passenger
need
not
inquire
into
documents
of
title
or
contractual
arrangements
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
has
a
right
to
be
served
without
discrimination”
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
same
general
approach
should
be
applied
here.
now,
respondent's
other
suggestion
that
there
may
in
fact,
be
no
disparity
in
it's
treatment
of
men
and
women,
or
that
whatever
disparity
exists
maybe
justifiable,
raise
somewhat
more
complex
issues.
we
recognize
that
the
act
does
not
prohibit
discriminations
between
parents
and
non-parents,
or
between
married
and
single
persons
so
long
as
those
discriminations
fall
equally
on
persons
of
both
sexes,
and
of
all
races,
religions
and
nationalities.
but,
the
commission
and
the
government
have
contended
with
some
success
in
the
lower
courts,
that
when
the
burden
of
a
discrimination
based
on
a
non-statutory
factor,
one
of
these
so
called
neutral
factors,
such
as
seniority
or
educational
background,
in
fact
fall
substantially
more
heavily
on
persons
of
a
particular
race
or
sex,
or
on
etcetera,
the
discrimination
is
prohibited
unless
it
is
justified
by
reasons
of
business
necessity.
now
that
is
the
issue
to
be
explored
in
the
case
of
griggs
against
duke
power
company,
number
124,
which
will
be
argued
in
a
few
says,
and
in
which
we
have
also
filed
a
brief.
the
commission
has
been
reluctant
however
to
see
their
approach
and
their
possible
justification
extended
to
discriminations
applied
directly
to
the
categories
of
person
specified
in
the
act,
such
as
discriminations
between
men
and
women.
now,
on
the
other
hand
the
act
itself,
in
section
703
(e),
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
bona
fide
occupational
provision,
expressly
authorizes
the
restriction
of
certain
jobs
to
persons
of
a
particular
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin,
although,
not
interestingly
to
the
persons
of
a
particular
race
in
instances
where
this
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
the
normal
operation
of
the
business.
but,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
this
exception
was
intended
to
be
a
narrow
one,
confined
to
the
need
for
employees
of
a
particular
nationality
religion
or
sex,
to
perform
a
particular
job.
examples
given
by
the
act
sponsors
were
french
chef
for
a
french
restaurant,
or
male
baseball
players
for
a
male
baseball
team
and
the
commission
accordingly
has
been
reluctant
to
see
this
exception
extended
to
cases
such
as
the
present
one,
in
which
it
is
admitted
that
women,
as
well
as,
men
can
and
do
perform
the
job
of
assembly
training.
this
explains
why
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
said
that
they
ought
to
be
able
to
qualify
under
this
exception
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
it
meant
that
they
ought
to
be
able
to
restrict
it
to
men,
that
that's
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
the
act
sponsor
said
that
that's
the
kind
of
thing
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
are
trying
to
justify
their
discrimination
against
men,
on
just
that
ground,
under
this
statute.
the
commission
has
opposed
their
justification
of
it,
but
that
is
an
issue
in
the
lower
courts
now.
but,
what
i
was
trying
to
do
was
to
explain
why
in
it's
first
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
the
commission
argued
that
there
could
be
no
possible
justification
under
the
act
for
the
kind
of
discrimination
involved
in
this
case.
and
that
any
requirement
of
work
attendants
or
rather
legitimate
business
requirement,
must
be
applied
by
the
respondent
to
it's
assembly
trainees
neutrally,
without
regard
to
sex.
but
after
the
unfavorable
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
panel,
the
commission
took
a
more
moderate
position
in
it's
second
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
our
brief
in
this
court
also
recognizes
that
in
light
of
the
express
congressional
judgment,
that
there
should
be
some
accommodation
to
legitimate
serious
business
needs.
the
possibility
should
be
left
open,
that
a
sufficient
shelling
of
overriding
business
necessity
might
me
made
in
a
particular
case
to
warrant
the
exclusion
from
particular
jobs
of
a
subcategory
of
one
of
the
classes
if
the
person
is
protected
by
the
act,
such
as
women
with
preschool
age
children.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
our
view
the
justification
would
have
to
be
a
very
strong
showing
and
i
don't
know
that
it
need
to
be
delimited
in
this
case
without
a
record,
by
this
court
now.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
an
example
would
be
that
the
company
invests
very
heavily
in
the
training
of
personnel
for
that
particular
job
and
that
the
great
majority
or
substantially
all
of
the
excluded
group
have
in
the
past
proved
to
be
unable
to
fulfill
reasonable
attendance
or
other
requirements
for
the
job.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
the
kind
of
thing
we'd
have
in
mind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
merely
a
higher
rate
because
statistics
only
show
some
disparity
between
every
group
virtually,
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
purpose
of
congress
--
it
would
be
significant,
i'm
sure
it
would
be
significant
to
the
employer,
but
the
purpose
of
congress
is
to
say
that
people
can't
be
just
put
into
classes
and
denied
a
chance
to
show
their
individual
ability
to
perform
a
job
or
that
their
idea
argued
was
to
get
away
from
employment
discrimination
by
stereotyped
groups
of
people
and
to
let
each
individual
meet
the
qualifications
and
the
requirements
for
the
job
on
his
own
merits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
showing
of
that
kind
of
experience,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
material.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
--
i
mean,
that
some
woman
did
this,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
this
woman
would
do
it
or
that
she
should
be
denied
her
opportunity
to
earn
her
living
and
a
living
for
her
children
because
of
what
some
other
woman
had
done
in
the
past,
that's
what
congress
decided,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act.
this
woman
has
seven
children
to
take
--
to
provide
for
and
she
wants
to
work.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
can
require
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
can
require
that
she
not
would
do
that
and
if
she
does
it
he
can
fire
her.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
think
it's
dispositive
unless
the
showing
is
a
very
strong
one,
a
very
strong
and
not
merely
that
statistically,
they
are
more
likely
to
do
it.
that's
denying
her
chance
to
perform
the
job?
if
she
is
willing
to
do
it
and
willing
to
accept
his
terms,
congress
has
said
she
should
have
the
opportunity.
congress
wanted
to
afford
her
that
protection
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
afford
it
to
her.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
case
under
title
vii,
the
equal
employment
opportunities
provision
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
to
be
argued
before
this
court.
and
for
that
reason
as
well
as
reasons
reflected
in
the
statistics
about
working
mothers,
reproduced
in
our
brief,
the
united
states
believes
the
case
to
be
an
important
one.
before
proceeding
to
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
make
one
correction
of
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
the
case
last
april.
we
stated
in
that
brief
that
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
stated
it
both
on
pages
2
and
3,
and
again
on
page
4,
but
we
are
informed
by
counsel
for
the
parties
that
no
such
petition
was
filed.
we
regret
our
error
about
this
which
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
under
its
own
rule
treated
the
request
by
one
of
the
members
of
that
court
for
reconsideration
of
the
panel
decision
as
a
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
my
knowledge,
but
there
is
a
specific
rule
about
it
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
denial
of
the
rehearing
en
banc,
you
will
note
in
the
record
that
denial
begins
with
the
statement
on
page
42
a
of
the
record.
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
denied
and
the
court
having
been
polled
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
and
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
not
having
voted
in
favor
of
it,
rehearing
en
banc
is
also
denied.
now,
i
mentioned
this
correction
because
of
the
respondent's
contention
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
untimely.
we
believe
along
with
the
petitioner
that
the
petition
is
timely
for
reasons
--
substantially
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
if
the
court
is
satisfied,
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
as
already
recounted,
the
summary
judgment
in
this
case
was
based
on
the
factual
parenthesis,
partly
assumed
by
the
district
court
that
the
respondent
excludes
men
but
not
women
--
excludes
women
but
not
men,
i
am
sorry,
that
the
respondent
excludes
women
but
not
men
with
pre-school
aged
children
from
employment
as
assembly
trainees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
to
be
trained
to
work
on
the
assembly
lines,
as
far
as
i
know
the
record
doesn’t
specify
what
the
job
is,
they
keep
referring
to
it
as
assembly
trainee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
doesn’t
--
i
am
sure
counsel
for
martin
marietta
could
tell
you,
i
mean
record
doesn't
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
there
is
a
affidavit,
that
is
un-contradicted
that
75
to
80%
of
them
are
women.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
a
higher
percentage
of
women
than
of
men
who
apply
are
hired
for
the
job
and
that
is
essentially
all
the
record
there
was,
other
than
the
complaint
and
the
answer
and
the
district
judge's
assumption
that
martin
marietta
did
hire
men
with
pre-school
aged
children
for
this
job.
since
this
is
the
first
case
under
title
vii,
i
might
say
for
purposes
of
clarity
that
in
our
view
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
quite
uniformly
agreed
with
this,
a
suit
of
this
kind
of
a
de
novo
proceeding
completely.
the
only
record
is
the
record
made
in
court,
this
is
not
a
review
of
administrative
decision,
and
there
is
no
administrative
record
being
reviewed
in
this
kind
of
a
suit,
even
though
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
had
investigated
this
compliant,
and
had
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
certainly
does,
in
fact
most
of
the
people
employed
in
this
job
are
women.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
they
have
--
because
their
women
with
pre-school
aged
children,
because
they
have
little
children,
they
won’t
hire
any
women
with
little
children.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
only
issue
is
whether
they
can
hire
men
with
little
children,
but
refuse
to
hire
women
with
little
children.
the
complainant
here
is
that
it
doesn’t
benefit
her
very
much
if
they
hire
other
women,
they
won’t
hire
her
even
though
they
will
hire
men
in
the
same
situation.
it
doesn't
benefit
the
children
who
depend
on
her
for
support
either,
that
they
are
willing
to
hire
other
women.
she
needs
the
job
and
that’s
with
her
complaint
was
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
and
that’s
what
her
complaint
is
in
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don’t
contend
that
it
is
irrational,
we
contend
that
it’s
illegal.
congress
made
a
judgment
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
many
things
that
are
illegal
may
not
be
irrational.
now
in
our
view,
the
courts
below
erred
in
holding
that
what
had
been
alleged
and
assumed
here
was
not
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
it
was
a
qualification
for
employment
applied
to
members
of
one
sex
and
not
the
other.
and
therefore,
on
its
face
which
is
all
that
we
have
here,
there
was
no
attempt
to
justify
it,
the
requirement
is
no
less
a
forbidden
discrimination
then
would
be
a
state
voting
qualification
requirement,
that
said
that
men
with
pre-school
age
children
could
vote,
the
women
with
pre-school
age
children
couldn’t
vote.
could
there
be
any
doubt
as
to
whether
that
violates
the
nineteenth
amendment.
in
other
words,
the
error
to
us
is
a
very
basic
one
of
not
recognizing
what
it
is
that
constitutes
a
discrimination.
you
don’t
have
to
exclude
all
women
in
order
to
be
discriminating
against
women,
when
you
exclude
some
of
them
on
grounds
that
aren’t
used
to
exclude
men.
that’s
in
essence
what
this
case
is
about,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
itself
apparently
recognized
that
its
sex
plus
standard
is
not
a
viable
age
interpret
the
act.
in
a
recent
decision
of
theirs,
which
to
our
way
of
thinking
backs
away
quite
considerably
from
this
phillip’s
decision
and
this
is
an
addition
that
we
should
make
to
our
brief.
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
we
refer
at
the
end
of
the
lengthy
footnote
on
that
page,
this
is
page
12
of
our
brief,
to
a
district
court
decision
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
called
lansdale
against
the
united
airlines
company.
and
there
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
martin
marietta,
quite
understandably
the
district
judge
held,
he
was
sitting
there
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
it
was
no
violation
of
the
act
for
the
airline
company
to
fire
its
stewardesses
when
they
got
married,
even
though
it
continued
to
employ
its
male
stewards
after
they
were
married.
it
was
sex
plus
and
the
fifth
circuit,
it
said
it
doesn't
violate
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
have
both
male
stewards
and
female
stewardesses,
and
when
they
get
married,
the
women
are
fired
but
the
men
are
allowed
to
continue
in
their
jobs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
on
august
13
of
this
year,
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
little
per
curiam
decision
reversed
this
lansdale
case
and
held,
this
is
case
number
29410
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
29410
decide
on
august
13
of
this
year
after
our
brief
was
filed,
and
they
said
a
little
per
curiam
opinion,
that
the
phillips
case
provided
no
authority
for
the
decision,
but
they
didn’t
explain
why
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
cases
also
called
lansdale
against
the
united
airlines
company.
it's
the
same
name
as
in
their
footnote.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
litigation
about
that
in
a
lower
courts
now,
as
to
whether
they
have
been
able
to
establish
a
defense
under
the
act,
under
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
defense,
and
this
is
a
matter
that
has
being
litigated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
this
is
the
kind
of
decision
that
now
has
to
be
justified
as
a
matter
relating
to
the
business
needs
of
the
company
or
else
it
can
no
more
be
done
than
could
--
it
can
no
more
be
perpetuated
than
a
decision
that
you
prefer
to
hire
whites
and
not
blacks.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
couldn't
say
with
authority.
my
belief
is
that
the
commission
has
opposed
that
a
discrimination,
but
i
couldn't
say
for
sure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
an
affirmative
not
from
one
of
the
commission
lawyers
that
the
commission
has
been
opposing
that
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
a
five-member
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
well,
one
i
am
told
--
well,
not
only
has
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
not
--
[attempt
to
laughter]
they
have
been
appointed
by
the
president.[laughter]
not
only
has
the
fifth
circuit
in
our
view
backed
away
from
the
rationale
of
this
decision,
but
as
we
read
its
brief
in
this
court
the
respondent
doesn't
itself
contend
that
the
broad
holding
of
the
court
allow
should
be
sustained
on
the
merits,
and
it’s
suggests
instead
that
a
more
fully
developed
record
might
show
that
its
refusal
to
hire
the
petitioner
didn't
violate
title
vii.
well,
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
what
prevented
development
of
the
record
was
the
erroneous
granting
of
the
summary
judgment
prematurely,
and
that
a
reversal
and
remand
of
the
case
that
called
for
and
on
that
premise,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
how
some
of
the
respondent's
suggestions
about
development
of
the
record
seemed
us
to
bear
on
the
issues
to
be
resolved
on
remand.
one
suggestion
is
that,
what
the
receptionist
told
the
petitioner
may
not
have
accurately
reflected
the
company's
policy.
now,
that
possibility
might
affect
whether
an
injunction
should
be
granted
or
what
the
terms
of
the
injunction
should
be,
but
it
would
not
in
our
view,
be
a
defense
to
the
charge
of
discrimination
against
the
petitioner
herself.
her
right
to
relief
under
the
act
does
not
depend
on
whether
there
has
been
a
pattern
or
general
practice
of
discrimination.
section
703
of
the
act,
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
2,
on
which
she
relies,
specifically
forbids
discrimination
against
“any
individual”
on
account
of
sex.
and
if
that
probation
is
to
be
effective
employers
must
be
held
responsible
of
the
acts
of
their
agents,
who
have
apparent
authority
to
reject
employment
applicants.
petitioner's
only
contact
was
with
the
receptionist.
there
was
no
other
spokesman
of
company
policy
for
her
and
the
company
never
undertook
to
resend
the
receptionist
rejection
of
her
employment
application.
so,
the
practical,
sensible
way
to
apply
the
statute
in
our
view
is
to
look
at
the
situation
realistically
from
the
standpoint
of
the
person
and
upon
whom
the
statute
confers
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
did
in
applying
a
similar
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
in
boynton
against
virginia,
in
volume
364
u.s.
the
court
there
held,
that
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
nondiscriminatory
service
in
a
bus
terminal
restaurant,
even
though
the
record
did
not
show
whether
the
restaurant
was
owned
or
controlled
by
a
carrier.
it
was
enough
that
the
terminal
and
the
restaurant
operated
as
an
integral
part
of
the
carrier's
transportation
service
for
interstate
passengers
and
in
those
circumstances
the
court
said,
“an
interstate
passenger
need
not
inquire
into
documents
of
title
or
contractual
arrangements
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
has
a
right
to
be
served
without
discrimination”
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
same
general
approach
should
be
applied
here.
now,
respondent's
other
suggestion
that
there
may
in
fact,
be
no
disparity
in
it's
treatment
of
men
and
women,
or
that
whatever
disparity
exists
maybe
justifiable,
raise
somewhat
more
complex
issues.
we
recognize
that
the
act
does
not
prohibit
discriminations
between
parents
and
non-parents,
or
between
married
and
single
persons
so
long
as
those
discriminations
fall
equally
on
persons
of
both
sexes,
and
of
all
races,
religions
and
nationalities.
but,
the
commission
and
the
government
have
contended
with
some
success
in
the
lower
courts,
that
when
the
burden
of
a
discrimination
based
on
a
non-statutory
factor,
one
of
these
so
called
neutral
factors,
such
as
seniority
or
educational
background,
in
fact
fall
substantially
more
heavily
on
persons
of
a
particular
race
or
sex,
or
on
etcetera,
the
discrimination
is
prohibited
unless
it
is
justified
by
reasons
of
business
necessity.
now
that
is
the
issue
to
be
explored
in
the
case
of
griggs
against
duke
power
company,
number
124,
which
will
be
argued
in
a
few
says,
and
in
which
we
have
also
filed
a
brief.
the
commission
has
been
reluctant
however
to
see
their
approach
and
their
possible
justification
extended
to
discriminations
applied
directly
to
the
categories
of
person
specified
in
the
act,
such
as
discriminations
between
men
and
women.
now,
on
the
other
hand
the
act
itself,
in
section
703
(e),
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
bona
fide
occupational
provision,
expressly
authorizes
the
restriction
of
certain
jobs
to
persons
of
a
particular
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin,
although,
not
interestingly
to
the
persons
of
a
particular
race
in
instances
where
this
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
the
normal
operation
of
the
business.
but,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
this
exception
was
intended
to
be
a
narrow
one,
confined
to
the
need
for
employees
of
a
particular
nationality
religion
or
sex,
to
perform
a
particular
job.
examples
given
by
the
act
sponsors
were
french
chef
for
a
french
restaurant,
or
male
baseball
players
for
a
male
baseball
team
and
the
commission
accordingly
has
been
reluctant
to
see
this
exception
extended
to
cases
such
as
the
present
one,
in
which
it
is
admitted
that
women,
as
well
as,
men
can
and
do
perform
the
job
of
assembly
training.
this
explains
why
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
said
that
they
ought
to
be
able
to
qualify
under
this
exception
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
it
meant
that
they
ought
to
be
able
to
restrict
it
to
men,
that
that's
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
the
act
sponsor
said
that
that's
the
kind
of
thing
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
are
trying
to
justify
their
discrimination
against
men,
on
just
that
ground,
under
this
statute.
the
commission
has
opposed
their
justification
of
it,
but
that
is
an
issue
in
the
lower
courts
now.
but,
what
i
was
trying
to
do
was
to
explain
why
in
it's
first
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
the
commission
argued
that
there
could
be
no
possible
justification
under
the
act
for
the
kind
of
discrimination
involved
in
this
case.
and
that
any
requirement
of
work
attendants
or
rather
legitimate
business
requirement,
must
be
applied
by
the
respondent
to
it's
assembly
trainees
neutrally,
without
regard
to
sex.
but
after
the
unfavorable
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
panel,
the
commission
took
a
more
moderate
position
in
it's
second
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
our
brief
in
this
court
also
recognizes
that
in
light
of
the
express
congressional
judgment,
that
there
should
be
some
accommodation
to
legitimate
serious
business
needs.
the
possibility
should
be
left
open,
that
a
sufficient
shelling
of
overriding
business
necessity
might
me
made
in
a
particular
case
to
warrant
the
exclusion
from
particular
jobs
of
a
subcategory
of
one
of
the
classes
if
the
person
is
protected
by
the
act,
such
as
women
with
preschool
age
children.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
our
view
the
justification
would
have
to
be
a
very
strong
showing
and
i
don't
know
that
it
need
to
be
delimited
in
this
case
without
a
record,
by
this
court
now.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
an
example
would
be
that
the
company
invests
very
heavily
in
the
training
of
personnel
for
that
particular
job
and
that
the
great
majority
or
substantially
all
of
the
excluded
group
have
in
the
past
proved
to
be
unable
to
fulfill
reasonable
attendance
or
other
requirements
for
the
job.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
the
kind
of
thing
we'd
have
in
mind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
merely
a
higher
rate
because
statistics
only
show
some
disparity
between
every
group
virtually,
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
purpose
of
congress
--
it
would
be
significant,
i'm
sure
it
would
be
significant
to
the
employer,
but
the
purpose
of
congress
is
to
say
that
people
can't
be
just
put
into
classes
and
denied
a
chance
to
show
their
individual
ability
to
perform
a
job
or
that
their
idea
argued
was
to
get
away
from
employment
discrimination
by
stereotyped
groups
of
people
and
to
let
each
individual
meet
the
qualifications
and
the
requirements
for
the
job
on
his
own
merits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
showing
of
that
kind
of
experience,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
material.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
--
i
mean,
that
some
woman
did
this,
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
this
woman
would
do
it
or
that
she
should
be
denied
her
opportunity
to
earn
her
living
and
a
living
for
her
children
because
of
what
some
other
woman
had
done
in
the
past,
that's
what
congress
decided,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act.
this
woman
has
seven
children
to
take
--
to
provide
for
and
she
wants
to
work.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
can
require
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
can
require
that
she
not
would
do
that
and
if
she
does
it
he
can
fire
her.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
think
it's
dispositive
unless
the
showing
is
a
very
strong
one,
a
very
strong
and
not
merely
that
statistically,
they
are
more
likely
to
do
it.
that's
denying
her
chance
to
perform
the
job?
if
she
is
willing
to
do
it
and
willing
to
accept
his
terms,
congress
has
said
she
should
have
the
opportunity.
congress
wanted
to
afford
her
that
protection
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
afford
it
to
her.
