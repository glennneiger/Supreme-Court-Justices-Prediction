justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
agreed
to
by
both
sides,
mr.
robinson?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
not
in
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
least
am
i
not
correct,
the
en
banc
court
made
reference
to
it,
at
least
the
dissenters
did?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
robinson,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
on
that?
educate
me
along
this
line,
suppose
a
hospital
for
years
had
employed
nothing
but
female
registered
nurses.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
today
after
the
passage
of
this
act,
a
male
nurse
applicant
comes
along.
do
i
understand
your
interpretation
of
the
act
to
be
that
just
because
they
have
always
had
female
rns
and
like
them
and
got
along
well,
they
could
not
refuse
to
hire
the
male
nurse,
in
the
absence
of
the
exception
in
the
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
robinson
i
suppose
as
practical
matter
if
this
case
goes
back,
would
it
be
your
guess
it
will
developed
on
the
proviso
or
exception
on
the
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
really
i
think
there
has
been
intimations
to
contrary
though
and
my
guess
is
that
if
it
goes
back,
good
lawyers
will
try
to
zero
in
on
that
and
we
will
have
an
entirely
different
case
when
it
comes
back
here.[laughter]
