well,
let
me
give
a
hypothetical.
you
got
a
confession,
you
as
the
prosecutor
and
you
notified
the
defense
counsel
informally
that
you
don’t
intend
to
use
and
you
don’t
probably
noticed
what
you
use
to
require
or
anything
like
that.
and
it
goes
on
and
this
is
the
involuntary
confession
on
the
three
different
positions
of
this
court
and
you’ve
tried
to
use
it
on
cross-examination
and
defense
counsel,
“oh!
wait
a
minute.
you
can’t
use
that.
i
claim
this
involuntary.”
wouldn’t
you
agree
that
then
we
have
a
hearing
as
a
jury?
justice
thurgood

once
this
challenge
is
being
involuntary,
then
you
have
this
sort
of
(voice
overlap)?
