justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
let
me
ask
a
trait
question.
i
have
another
chance
to
review
the
entire
record.
is
there
any
claim,
anywhere
along
the
line
of
the
contents
in
the
statement
are
untrue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
is
my
next
question
is,
whether
you
are
arguing
prejudice
in
the
light
of
the
acquittal
on
the
one
count?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
on
that
approach,
the
miranda
should
be
fully
retroactive,
should
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you’re
operating
here
an
unfortunate
chronology
--
had
johnson
said
that
retroactivity
was
directed
to
the
time
of
the
taking
of
the
statement
rather
than
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
the
trial
which
should
be
here
today?
