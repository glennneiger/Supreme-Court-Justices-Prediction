ms.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statement
was
not
coerced.
it
has
never
been
suggested
that
the
statement
was
coerced.
the
objection
that
was
raised
to
its
use
in
the
far
level
was
that
it
violated
miranda
and
on
that
objection,
the
state
lost.
there
was
a
hearing
held
after
the
impeachment
in
the
judges’
chambers
at
which
the
judge
did
give
mr.
facelle,
the
prosecutor,
an
opportunity
to
show
that
perhaps
miranda
was
not
violated.
he
tried.
he
lost.
but
that
was
the
only
objection
that
there
was
or
could
have
been
to
this
statement.
this
voluntary
statement
that
was
given
prior
to
miranda
was
used
to
discredit
trial
testimony.
it
was
not
used
to
establish
viven
harris’
guilt
of
the
substantive
crime.
but
when
the
petitioner,
in
this
case,
took
the
witness
stand
and
affirmatively
resorted
to
perjury,
the
jury
was
entitled
to
know
that
its
trial
testimony
was
not
the
only
version
of
the
events
that
he
had
ever
given.
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
extended
to
bar
this
limited
use
of
a
voluntary
statement
that
was
lawfully
obtained
because
the
new
york
rule
which
allows
this
impeaching
use
of
the
statement,
safeguards
very
vital
aspect
of
the
jury’s
role
as
a
fact-finding
body.
and
that
aspect
is
not
the
one
that
is
endangered
by
the
ordinary
exclusionary
rule.
indeed,
there
is
no
need
even
to
consider
extending
the
exclusionary
rule
to
this
case
because
this
use
of
petitioner’s
statement
did
not
violate
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
was
not
by
being
impeached
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
the
statement
was
voluntary
and
it
was
never
introduced
for
the
truth
of
its
content.
in
allowing
this
impeachment
moreover,
the
trial
court
was
not
and
this
court
will
not
be
condoning
any
police
misconduct.
there
was
no
police
misconduct
or
prosecutorial
misconduct
involved
in
the
questioning
of
viven
harris.

yes.
ms.

to
put
it
in
its
context
what
his
trial
testimony
was,
was
very,
very
elaborate
as
to
what
it
got
on.
he
gave
an
elaborate
version
of
what
happened
on
january
4th,
all
of
which
was
to
point
that
i
never
sold
him
narcotics,
but
it
involved
an
undercover
police
officer
begging
and
pleading
with
this
man,
“please,
please,
give
me
narcotics,”
to
which
viven
has
although
he
wasn’t
adverse
to
doing
this.
he
said,
he
couldn’t
do
it,
quite
simply
because
there
was
a
panic
on.
with
respect
to
the
second
sale,
his
testimony
got
even
more
elaborate.
he
was
still
reluctant
to
given
to
this
pleading
and
this
begging.
however
he
had
friend,
named
henry
stanley
who
bermudez,
the
undercover
detective
give
by
association
put
together
with
him,
“birds
of
the
feather,”
according
to
viven
harris,
“flocked
together.”
and
stanley
was
willing
to
put
on
this
elaborate
scheme
of
selling
the
undercover
officer
baking
powder.
well.
i
don’t
want
to
elaborate
even
more
but
this
was
very
detailed.
and
also
involve
very
detailed
conversation
from
december
15th.
he
was
confronted
with
the
prior
inconsistent
statement.
ms.
sybil
h.
landau
verbally,
he
was
asked,
“do
you
remember?”
this
is
the
rule.
the
evidentiary
rule
as
it
exists
in
new
york
is
that
you
don’t
just
surprise
the
man
with
a
prior
inconsistent
statement.
you
give
him
the
opportunity
to
explain
which
asked,
“do
you
remember
being
asked
this
question
and
giving
this
answer?”
so,
he
read
it.
“do
you
remember
being
asked
this
question
and
giving
this
answer?”
viven
harris’
response
was,
“i
don’t
remember.”
it
was
this
response,
not
the
inconsistency
that
the
prosecutor
used
so
effectively
against
him
because
it
could
not
be
true
that
viven
harris
could
remember
a
detail
conversation
from
december
15.
a
detailed,
endlessly,
detailed
conversation
from
january
4
and
january
6,
but
have
a
total
lapse
of
memory,
24
hours
later
on
january
7.
that
was
the
way
he
was
impeached
in
this
case.
by
being
confronted,
now
he
couldn’t
have
been
confronted
with
the
statement
and
asked
that
he
remembered
it,
he
could
never
been
impeached
by
his
testimonial
claim,
“i
don’t
remember
it.”
this
statement
was
never
used
nor
was
it
argued
or
was
it
suggested
that
it
could
be
used
for
the
truth
of
it
contents
or
that
those
contents
or
even
the
fact
that
he
was
a
liar
proved
him
guilty.
what
the
prosecution
did
this
statement
was
to
say,
“you
heard
my
witnesses,
you
heard
viven
harris,
who
here
is
telling
the
truth?”
and
then
he
argued
the
if
the
petitioner
was
abusing
the
jury’s
intelligence
by
trying
to
tell
them
that
all
these
sort
of
facts
was
true,
that
he
couldn’t
remember
what
happened
24
hours
later.
that’s
the
sole
extent
of
the
impeachment
here.
now,
the
instruction,
not
simply
the
instruction
in
this
case
but
in
instruction
in
any
similar
case
to
the
jury
that
this
statement
can
be
used
only
as
it
--
in
their
assessment
of
the
defendant’s
credibility
is
a
very
readily
understood
instruction.
it’s
is
in
accordance
with
common
sense.
it’s
in
accordance
with
everyday
common
sense
that
a
man
who
is
willing
to
tell
different
accounts
of
the
same
event
is
not
likely
or
should
not
be
believed
as
to
either
account.
and
because
of
this,
it
doesn’t
create
a
risk
of
the
jury
who
is
going
to
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
follow
the
instructions.
now
we
know
for
a
fact
that
in
this
case,
the
jury
followed
the
instruction.
the
prior
inconsistent
statement,
we
can
divide
it
into
two
parts,
january
4th
and
january
6th
--
ms.
sybil
h.
landau
yes,
i
have
to
look
at
my
brief
to
do
that.
the
--
ms.
sybil
h.
landau
it’s
in
my
brief
and
i
talked
about
the
facts,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it’s
page
575
or
in
the
appendix
a–95.
ms.
sybil
h.
landau
yes,
he
said.
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation,
as
to
that
statements
before
given
by
the
defendant
mr.
facelle
that
this
goes
to
--
the
questions
and
answers
gather
the
weight
and
the
credibility
that
you
give
to
a
witnesses’
testimony,
you
may
take
this
into
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
defend
any
person
that
has
made
parrying
of
this
statement.
“you
may
take
that
into
consideration
in
determining
how
much
weight
you
attach
to
witnesses’
testimony,
how
believable
it
becomes
under
all
the
circumstances
but
i
caution
you
again,”
because
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
court
is
so
instructed
to
do
right,
“i
caution
you
again,
that
this
does
not
prove
the
defendant’s
guilt.”
this
goes
to
the
weight,
the
believability
of
the
witnesses’
testimony.
and
we
know
in
this
case
that
the
jury
did
in
fact
follow
that
instruction
because
they
found
him,
they
did
not
convict
him
on
the
first
count.
the
statement
as
the
first
count
was
a
confession.
it
was
minimizing
his
role,
that’s
very
true.
but
it
was
a
confession
and
it
was
also
inconformity
to
the
people’s
proof.
that
second
statement,
the
one
which
is,
“at
the
moment
before
this
court,”
the
one
on
which
he
was
convicted
was
a
falsehood.
it
was
untrue.
he
never
--
what
he
said
to
the
da
when
he
was
questioned
was,
“well,
he
asked
me
to
get
him
some
narcotics
and
i
went
to
get
it.”
now
he
just
told
about
going
some
place
and
the
da
say
said,
“some
place
you
went
to
the
same
place?”
harris
said,
“yes,
no,
no,
no.
when
i
walked
outside
the
door,
the
man
was
there
and
i
got
it
from
him.”
“and
you
got
12
bucks
for
this?”
“yes,
i
got
12
buck
for
this?”
“did
you
get
anything
else?”
“yes,
i
got
to
taste
this
heroin.”
that
was
a
lie.
oh!
yes,
it
was
true
that
on
january
6,
1966,
viven
harris
gave
two
glassine
envelopes
in
exchange
for
$12.00
to
detective
george
bermudez
but
it
never
happened
in
the
bar.
he
never
got
it
from
some
man
standing
outside
the
bar.
he
went
over
to
him
in
the
bar.
he
said
to
him,
“do
you
want
anything
today?”
he
said,
“yes,
i’ll
take
a
couple.”
harris
said
“okay.
but
i
have
to
go
home
to
get
it.”
this
is
the
truth.
“i
have
to
go
home
to
get
it.”
he
goes
outside.
he
goes
back
home
for
it.
he’s
gone
20
minutes.
he
comes
back
in
to
the
bar
and
he
said,
“hey,
joe”
because
that’s
the
name
bermudez
is
using,
“will
you
step
outside
with
me
for
a
minute?”
they
go
outside,
they’re
seen
outside,
the
partner
of
the
detective
sees
them
outside,
sees
them
in
the
automobiles,
sees
that
double
exchange
of
hands.
we’ve
all
become
so
familiar
with
it.
that
second
statement
was
false.
but
that’s
irrelevant
because
it’s
not
introduced
for
the
truth
of
this
content.
its
value
lies.
in
the
fact
the
defendant
was
willing
to
tell
different
stories.
this
is
also
the
answer
to
the
coerced
confession,
not
only
wasn’t
the
statement
coerced
and
there’s
has
never
been
a
claim
of
coercion.
but
under
the
law
in
new
york,
you
may
not
use
a
coerced
confession
as
a
prior
and
consistent
statement.
it
cannot
be.
it
can
be
inconsistency.
but
to
be
a
prior
inconsistent
statement
by
definition
that
defendant
must
have
been
willing
to
make
the
earlier
statement
and
a
statement
that’s
been
coerced
is
not
the
one
that
defendant
is
being
willing
to
make.
so
the
statement
is
excluding
not
because
it’s
unreliable,
that’s
irrelevant
in
a
way
because
it
does
not
offer
for
its
truth.
it’s
excluded
before
us.
it
is
coerced
and
therefore
has
no
probative
value
on
issue
of
this
credibility.
it
was
said
by
the
petitioner
here
that
defendants
will
now
be
discouraged
from
taking
the
witness
stand.
the
rule
in
this
case,
the
rule
adopted
by
the
new
court
of
appeals
will
now
and
has
not
and
could
not
discourage
defendants
from
the
taking
the
witness
stand
because
this
statement
to
the
extent
that
the
hypothesis
is
made
that
a
person
has
a
reasonable
explanation
for
why
he
made
an
inconsistent
statement.
many
times
people
do
tell
a
lies
to
the
police
but
have
reasonable
explanations
whether
it
was
fear
or
bewilderment,
nobody
has
a
reasonable
explanation
for
an
inconsistent
statement
which
is
compatible
with
the
truth
of
this
trial
testimony
or
hesitate
to
take
the
stand
and
give
that
explanation.
and
even
beyond
this,
we
know
from
experience
that
defendants
where
confessions
are
actually
introduced
as
evidence
of
guilt
have
never
hesitated
to
take
the
witness
stand.
it
is
not
the
existence
and
evidence
or
proof
of
guilt
out
of
its
own
mouth
which
keeps
the
defendant
off
the
witness
stand.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
availability
not
as
proof
of
guilt
but
simply
if
the
man,
affirmatively
resorts
to
perjury
that
the
availability
of
this
statement
to
impeach
him
to
expose
to
the
jury
that
this
may
not
be
the
truth
will
deter
any
defendant
from
taking
the
witness
stand.
now
this
situation
in
this
case
is
different
than
the
situation
in
brewton.
in
brewton,
the
statement
is
introduced.
the
co-defendant
statement
is
introduced
not
only
as
the
truth
of
its
content.
it’s
used
as
the
direct
evidence
of
guilt
against
the
co-defendant.
it’s
this
which
the
jury
has
difficulty
in
following,
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
thank
you.
ms.

mr.

may

the

was
not

has
never

the

but
that
was
the
only
objection
that
there

this

this

this
was
very
detailed.

from

was,

a
detail
conversation
from
december
15.
a
detailed,
endlessly,
detailed
conversation
from
january
4
and
january
6,
but
have
a
total
lapse
of
memory,
24
hours
later
on
january
7.
that
was
the
way
he
was
impeached
in
this
case.
by
being
confronted,
now
he
couldn’t
have
been
confronted
with
the
statement
and
asked
that
he
remembered
it,
he
could
never
been
impeached
by
his
testimonial
claim,
“i
don’t
remember
it.”
this
statement
was
never
used
nor
was
it
argued
or
was
it
suggested
that
it
could
be
used
for
the
truth
of
it
contents
or
that
those
contents
or
even
the
fact
that
he
was
a
liar
proved
him
guilty.
what
the
prosecution
did
this
statement
was
to
say,
“you
heard
my
witnesses,
you
heard
viven
harris,
who
here
is
telling
the
truth?”
and
then
he
argued
the
if
the
petitioner
was
abusing
the
jury’s
intelligence
by
trying
to
tell
them
that
all
these
sort
of
facts
was
true,
that
he
couldn’t
remember
what
happened
24
hours
later.
that’s
the
sole
extent
of
the
impeachment
here.
now,
the
instruction,
not
simply
the
instruction
in
this
case
but
in
instruction
in
any
similar
case
to
the
jury
that
this
statement
can
be
used
only
as
it
--
in
their
assessment
of
the
defendant’s
credibility
is
a
very
readily
understood
instruction.
it’s
is
in
accordance
with
common
sense.
it’s
in
accordance
with
everyday
common
sense
that
a
man
who
is
willing
to
tell
different
accounts
of
the
same
event
is
not
likely
or
should
not
be
believed
as
to
either
account.
and
because
of
this,
it
doesn’t
create
a
risk
of
the
jury
who
is
going
to
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
follow
the
instructions.
now
we
know
for
a
fact
that
in
this
case,
the
jury
followed
the
instruction.
the
prior
inconsistent
statement,
we
can
divide
it
into
two
parts,
january
4th
and
january
6th
--
ms.
sybil
h.
landau
yes,
i
have
to
look
at
my
brief
to
do
that.
the
--
ms.
sybil
h.
landau
it’s
in
my
brief
and
i
talked
about
the
facts,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it’s
page
575
or
in
the
appendix
a–95.
ms.
sybil
h.
landau
yes,
he
said.
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation,
as
to
that
statements
before
given
by
the
defendant
mr.
facelle
that
this
goes
to
--
the
questions
and
answers
gather
the
weight
and
the
credibility
that
you
give
to
a
witnesses’
testimony,
you
may
take
this
into
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
defend
any
person
that
has
made
parrying
of
this
statement.
“you
may
take
that
into
consideration
in
determining
how
much
weight
you
attach
to
witnesses’
testimony,
how
believable
it
becomes
under
all
the
circumstances
but
i
caution
you
again,”
because
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
court
is
so
instructed
to
do
right,
“i
caution
you
again,
that
this
does
not
prove
the
defendant’s
guilt.”
this
goes
to
the
weight,
the
believability
of
the
witnesses’
testimony.
and
we
know
in
this
case
that
the
jury
did
in
fact
follow
that
instruction
because
they
found
him,
they
did
not
convict
him
on
the
first
count.
the
statement
as
the
first
count
was
a
confession.
it
was
minimizing
his
role,
that’s
very
true.
but
it
was
a
confession
and
it
was
also
inconformity
to
the
people’s
proof.
that
second
statement,
the
one
which
is,
“at
the
moment
before
this
court,”
the
one
on
which
he
was
convicted
was
a
falsehood.
it
was
untrue.
he
never
--
what
he
said
to
the
da
when
he
was
questioned
was,
“well,
he
asked
me
to
get
him
some
narcotics
and
i
went
to
get
it.”
now
he
just
told
about
going
some
place
and
the
da
say
said,
“some
place
you
went
to
the
same
place?”
harris
said,
“yes,
no,
no,
no.
when
i
walked
outside
the
door,
the
man
was
there
and
i
got
it
from
him.”
“and
you
got
12
bucks
for
this?”
“yes,
i
got
12
buck
for
this?”
“did
you
get
anything
else?”
“yes,
i
got
to
taste
this
heroin.”
that
was
a
lie.
oh!
yes,
it
was
true
that
on
january
6,
1966,
viven
harris
gave
two
glassine
envelopes
in
exchange
for
$12.00
to
detective
george
bermudez
but
it
never
happened
in
the
bar.
he
never
got
it
from
some
man
standing
outside
the
bar.
he
went
over
to
him
in
the
bar.
he
said
to
him,
“do
you
want
anything
today?”
he
said,
“yes,
i’ll
take
a
couple.”
harris
said
“okay.
but
i
have
to
go
home
to
get
it.”
this
is
the
truth.
“i
have
to
go
home
to
get
it.”
he
goes
outside.
he
goes
back
home
for
it.
he’s
gone
20
minutes.
he
comes
back
in
to
the
bar
and
he
said,
“hey,
joe”
because
that’s
the
name
bermudez
is
using,
“will
you
step
outside
with
me
for
a
minute?”
they
go
outside,
they’re
seen
outside,
the
partner
of
the
detective
sees
them
outside,
sees
them
in
the
automobiles,
sees
that
double
exchange
of
hands.
we’ve
all
become
so
familiar
with
it.
that
second
statement
was
false.
but
that’s
irrelevant
because
it’s
not
introduced
for
the
truth
of
this
content.
its
value
lies.
in
the
fact
the
defendant
was
willing
to
tell
different
stories.
this
is
also
the
answer
to
the
coerced
confession,
not
only
wasn’t
the
statement
coerced
and
there’s
has
never
been
a
claim
of
coercion.
but
under
the
law
in
new
york,
you
may
not
use
a
coerced
confession
as
a
prior
and
consistent
statement.
it
cannot
be.
it
can
be
inconsistency.
but
to
be
a
prior
inconsistent
statement
by
definition
that
defendant
must
have
been
willing
to
make
the
earlier
statement
and
a
statement
that’s
been
coerced
is
not
the
one
that
defendant
is
being
willing
to
make.
so
the
statement
is
excluding
not
because
it’s
unreliable,
that’s
irrelevant
in
a
way
because
it
does
not
offer
for
its
truth.
it’s
excluded
before
us.
it
is
coerced
and
therefore
has
no
probative
value
on
issue
of
this
credibility.
it
was
said
by
the
petitioner
here
that
defendants
will
now
be
discouraged
from
taking
the
witness
stand.
the
rule
in
this
case,
the
rule
adopted
by
the
new
court
of
appeals
will
now
and
has
not
and
could
not
discourage
defendants
from
the
taking
the
witness
stand
because
this
statement
to
the
extent
that
the
hypothesis
is
made
that
a
person
has
a
reasonable
explanation
for
why
he
made
an
inconsistent
statement.
many
times
people
do
tell
a
lies
to
the
police
but
have
reasonable
explanations
whether
it
was
fear
or
bewilderment,
nobody
has
a
reasonable
explanation
for
an
inconsistent
statement
which
is
compatible
with
the
truth
of
this
trial
testimony
or
hesitate
to
take
the
stand
and
give
that
explanation.
and
even
beyond
this,
we
know
from
experience
that
defendants
where
confessions
are
actually
introduced
as
evidence
of
guilt
have
never
hesitated
to
take
the
witness
stand.
it
is
not
the
existence
and
evidence
or
proof
of
guilt
out
of
its
own
mouth
which
keeps
the
defendant
off
the
witness
stand.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
availability
not
as
proof
of
guilt
but
simply
if
the
man,
affirmatively
resorts
to
perjury
that
the
availability
of
this
statement
to
impeach
him
to
expose
to
the
jury
that
this
may
not
be
the
truth
will
deter
any
defendant
from
taking
the
witness
stand.
now
this
situation
in
this
case
is
different
than
the
situation
in
brewton.
in
brewton,
the
statement
is
introduced.
the
co-defendant
statement
is
introduced
not
only
as
the
truth
of
its
content.
it’s
used
as
the
direct
evidence
of
guilt
against
the
co-defendant.
it’s
this
which
the
jury
has
difficulty
in
following,
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
thank
you.
