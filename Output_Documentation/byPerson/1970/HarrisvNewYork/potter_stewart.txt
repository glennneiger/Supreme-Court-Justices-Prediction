of
course
as
of
that
time
he
didn’t
have
either
of
those
rights
under
the
united
states
of
constitution,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
a
fact
and
it’s
not
a
matter
of
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
mr.
aurnou.
well,
am
i
right
in
inferring
these
two
inferences?
first,
that
the
statement
he
made
--
the
statement
he
made
standing
independently
was
not
in
any
sense
of
the
word
a
confession,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
standing
independently,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
statement
he
made
--
how
was
that
--
was
it,
tell
me
why
and
how
is
a
confession.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
only
one
combined
with
the
testimony
that
he
gave
in
court
that
it
became
damaging
–-
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
the
second
count?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
now
secondly.
is
there
any
claim
here
that
the
statement
was
coerced
or
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
didn’t
quite
understand
the
--
i
heard
what
you
said
but
my
question
was,
is
there
any
claim
that
it
was
coerced?
justice
potter
stewart
i
like
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
as
to
coercion
or
the
involuntariness
of
the
statement,
do
i
understand
it
to
be
your
submission
that
because
of
the
attitude
of
the
prosecutor
took,
the
ruling
of
the
court
was,
that
even
assuming
it
was
coerced,
it
can
still
be
used.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
that
we
should
decide
this
case
therefore
on
the
hypothesis,
or
whatever
the
facts
may
be,
that
this
was
coerced?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
statement
in
question
accurately
reported
in
full
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
pages
72
to
78
of
the
appendix
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
an
active
statement
so
whether
or
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
ignore
your
admission
or
the
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
this
had
been
a
coerced
confession?
could
you
impeach
him
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
have
you
finished?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn’t
mean
untrue
confession.
i
meant
simply
an
involuntary
confession.
could
you
use
that
to
impeach
him?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
true.
but
the
law
is
very,
very
well
developed
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
certainly
over
the
last
10
or
12
years
that
the
confession
that
is
involuntary
even
though
demonstratively
true
is
nonetheless
wholly
inadmissible.
and
let’s
assume
that
you
had
a
course
or
involuntary
confession,
and
let’s
assume
further
that
it
was
wholly
true,
could
you
have
use
that
to
impeach
him?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
your
brother
in
the
other
side
has
told
us
that
because
of
the
posture
in
which
this
question
arose
in
the
trial
court,
we
must
proceed
upon
a
hypothesis
that
this
was
an
involuntary
--
that
this
was
an
involuntary
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
ms.
