mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
arrested
on
january
7
of
1966
and
subsequently
charged
in
a
two-count
indictment
with
two
identical
counts
of
sale
of
a
narcotic
drug
to
an
undercover
agent,
the
same
undercover
agent,
two
days
apart.
and
these
two
offenses
occurred
allegedly
the
day
before
and
three
days
before
the
date
of
his
arrest.
after
his
arrest
and
the
time
factor
in
not
found
in
the
record,
he
was
removed
to
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
of
westchester
county
at
our
courthouse.
and
there,
in
the
presence
of
a
number
of
law
enforcement
officers,
detectives,
assistant
district
attorneys
and
so
forth,
and
a
stenographer,
a
written
statement
was
taken
from
him
which
does
appear
in
its
entirety
in
the
record
before
you.
however,
that
statement
itself
discloses
that
it
followed
a
period
of
questioning,
the
length
of
which
is
never
disclosed
by
the
same
district
attorney,
same
law
enforcement
officers
and
there
is
no
place
in
this
record
where
the
facts
of
the
prior
questioning
are
elicited.
it
so
happen
that
this
case
was
tried
before
one
of
our
most
beloved
and
respected
judges
and
when
the
statement
came
up,
he,
realizing
precisely
the
point
that
was
at
issue,
the
difference
between
the
miranda
view
of
impeachment
that
i
take
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals’
view
in
the
kulis
case
asked
the
prosecutor
who
tried
the
case,
who
was
the
same
prosecutor
who
took
the
statement,
“mr.
facelle,
did
you
give
this
man
any
warning
other
than
appears
in
this
statement?”
and
the
prosecutor
said,
he
had
not.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
judge
robert
e.
dempsey,
your
honor.
now,
what
that
meant
was
that
couple
with
the
statement
itself
which
shows
you
in
repeated
places
the
prosecutor
says
to
him,
“all
i
want
you
to
do
is
tell
us
what
you
already
told
us
before.”
and
mr.
harris,
well,
he
was
23
years
old.
he
did
have
a
10th
grade
education.
such
as
it
was,
he
was
an
addict
and
he
was
suffering
from
withdrawal
syndromes.
and
mr.
harris
said
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
questioned
without
warnings
and
he
was
now
being
questioned
by
a
reporter,
he
said
“i’d
like
to
see
a
lawyer.”
he
said,
“i
don’t
think
i
should
keep
on
before
i
see
a
lawyer.”
and
at
that
point,
mr.
facelle
told
him
that
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
a
lawyer.
he
said,
“i’ll
have
him
taken
out.
he
can
get
a
lawyer.”
but
the
petitioner
was
indigent.
he
had
no
prior
felony
convictions.
he
had
minimal
involvement
with
the
law
in
my
view
and
i
don’t
think
for
a
moment
that
he
understood
either
that
he
had
a
right
to
cancel
then
and
there
or
that
he
had
a
right
to
free
counsel
then
and
there,
and
his
answer
is
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
at
that
date,
your
honor,
miranda
had
not
come
down
and
the
standard
had
not
been
explicitly
decided.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
my
view
and
i
commend
to
you
that
escobedo
was
in
existence
at
that
time.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
but
the
opinion
which
i
believe
your
honor
wrote
said
that
confession
obtained
under
such
circumstances
could
not
be
used.
that
was
the
word
you
used
and
i
prefer
to
admissibility
because
“used”
and
“admissibility”
have
some
distinctions
in
this
case.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
when
he
asked
for
a
lawyer,
it
was
not
only
a
question
of
rights
were
available
to
him
because
he
didn’t
appreciate
what
they
were
at
all.
but
the
prosecutor
did
lo
and
behold
,when
you
get
to
the
end
of
this
statement,
the
prosecutor
says
to
him,
“by
the
way,
when
you
kept
on
going
after
you
asked
for
a
lawyer,
you
meant
to
waive
a
lawyer,
didn’t
you?”
and
viven
harris
said,
“huh?”
he
didn’t
understand.
and
the
young
lady
from
new
york
county
makes
a
point
in
her
brief
that
they
explained
it
to
him.
well,
they
told
him
what
the
word
waiver
meant
but
they
didn’t
tell
him
a
thing
about
the
consequences
of
it,
not
three-word
explanation.
so
mr.
harris
found
himself
in
what
i
believe
to
be
the
situation
of
the
type
of
defendant
that
you
have
been
most
alert
to
protect,
one
who
is
in
no
position
to
comprehend
or
to
appreciate
what
right
it
is
he
said
to
have
waived
because
he
doesn’t
understand
the
nature
of
it
at
that
time.
now,
when
you
come
to
the
question
of
fairness
to
law
enforcement
officers,
it
is
suggested
that
well,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
raised,
maybe
that
wasn’t
the
law
at
the
time.
i
think
that
law
was
reasonably
inferable
from
what
this
court
had
been
doing
and
i
think
the
prosecutor
did
infer
or
he
wouldn’t
have
asked
him
about
the
waiver
which
is
the
traditional
way
of
trying
to
get
around
miranda.
but
something
more
important
happened
and
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court
in
johnson,
because
on
the
day
that
mr.
harris
came
to
trial,
there
wasn’t
any
question
about
what
the
law
was.
his
legal
aid
attorney
try
one
of
his
first
cases,
knew
exactly
what
the
law
was
and
made
the
proper
objections.
the
judge
and
perhaps
it’s
the
reason
we
respect
him
so
highly,
pointed
out
to
the
prosecuting
attorneys
that
if
you
do
this,
it
will
have
to
be
decided
in
an
appellate
court.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
judge.
i
have
to
explain
that
in
terms
of
the
respective
positions,
judge
blackmun
that
each
of
the
parties
herein.
miss
landau
in
the
new
york
county
brief
makes
the
unequivocal
statement
that
as
to
one
date
it’s
true
and
as
to
one
date
it
is
not
true.
mr.
duggan
makes
the
statement
in
the
westchester
county
brief
that
the
jury
must
have
believed
him
or
they
would
have
convicted
on
both
counts
rather
than
solely
on
the
second
count.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
i
would
like
to
explain
my
view
on
that
and
perhaps
your
question
makes
this
the
appropriate
time.
i
think
that
what
happened
was
this.
the
statement
have
vast
difference
intrinsically
as
to
the
two
counts.
on
the
first
count,
the
statement
indicated
that
viven
harris
had
acted
solely
as
the
agent
of
the
police
officer.
that
is
the
agent
desire
to
make
the
buy,
the
agent
paid
for
it.
viven
harris
derived
nothing
from
the
act
of
being
a
conduit.
and
in
fact,
judge
dempsey
expressly
charged
the
jury
that
if
they
found
him
to
be
an
agent,
they
must
acquit.
i
think
that
happened.
on
the
second
count
however,
it
was
unbelievably
damming
in
this
sense,
petitioner’s
testimony
at
the
trial
was,
that
he
had
in
fact
through
a
scheme
and
deception
provided
two
bags
of
a
substitute
for
heroin.
there’s
no
heroin
in
these
bags
at
all
which
he
gave.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
believe
that’s
correct
judge,
by
the
point
was
it
had
just
enough
for
of
a
kick
to
deceive
anybody
who
was
a
snorter
which
was
their
impression
of
what
detective
bermudas
was
masquerading
(voice
overlap).
however,
the
statement
contained
the
suggestion
that
not
only
that
did
he
get
monetary
payment
for
it,
but
he
got
a
taste
of
heroin
from
those
two
bags.
it
meant
that
the
entire
statement
would
be
meaningless
unless
in
fact
there
was
heroin
in
those
two
little
bags.
now,
mr.
duggan
has
suggested
that
it
wasn’t
so
significant
as
to
the
second
count
because
how
could
he
refuse
the
heroin
that
was
offered
to
him
without
giving
away
the
game
that
they
were
playing.
the
answer
is
that
you
cannot
find
in
this
record
that
it
was
ever
offered
to
him.
what
you
find
is
that
he
took
it
in
payment
but
you
do
not
find
any
testimony
that
bermudez,
the
detective,
offered
this
to
him
voluntarily.
he
wanted
it
as
far
as
appears
from
the
statement.
now
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
we
disagree
on
that
your
honor
(voice
overlap).
as
to
the
second
count
–-
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
as
to
the
second
count.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
because
it
indicated:
(a)
that
he
had
furnished
the
heroin
and
(b)
that
by
taking
back
a
taste,
it
was
in
fact
heroin
that
he
had
furnished
and
received
money
for.
and
that
is
his
honor
charged
to
jury
under
the
statute
would
be
sufficient
to
convict
in
new
york.
so
as
to
the
second
count
judge,
and
i’m
limiting
myself
to
the
second
count
respectfully,
i
think
in
fact
it
was
a
confession.
but
in
any
event,
certainly
an
admission,
and
when
you
come
down
to
that
–-
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
excuse
me,
your
honor.
no,
i’m
suggesting
something
quite
different
your
honor,
i’m
suggesting
that
it
had
a
separate
independent
effect
when
combined
with
his
testimony
that
demonstrate
the
possibility
of
falsehood.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
either
at
the
time
of
the
prior
statement
of
the
trial.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
but
it
also
had
an
independent
evil
effect
of
it’s
own
as
a
confession
and
i
would
not
have
you
think
i
conceive
in
anyway
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
that’s
right.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
unfortunately
judge,
that
aspect
of
the
record
was
foreclosed
by
the
prosecution.
now,
mr.
prudanski,
the
young
man
who
tried
this
case
for
legal
aid
made
such
an
objection
and
he
made
it
by
referring
to
jackson
against
denno
and
to
section
813
(f)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
in
new
york
which
is
the
statute
dealing
with
the
hearing
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
the
prosecutor
objected
at
that
time
and
certainly
new
york
county,
at
least
still
takes
the
position
that
it
makes
no
difference
what
happens
at
a
voluntariness
hearing
because
you
can
just
proceed
to
impeach
him
with
it
anyhow
even
if
it’s
involuntary,
in
the
mcnabb
situation
for
example.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
well,
that’s
what
i’m
--
i’m
sorry
if
i’ve
been
wordy
judge,
i
didn’t
mean
to
evade.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
when
we
attempted
to
raise
it
in
new
york,
when
we
asked
for
a
hearing
on
that
issue,
we
were
foreclosed
by
the
prosecution’s
objection
that
the
result
of
such
a
voluntariness
hearing
wouldn’t
prevent
him
from
using
it.
and
the
trial
judge
is
learned
and
wonderful
as
he
was.
he
is
a
wonderful
man,
he
agreed
with
that
of
the
authority
of
kulis
but
having
read
miranda,
he
told
mr.
facelle
that
you
face
the
problem
and
the
appellate
court
may
very
well
determine
that
this
is
not
permissible.
and
of
course
he
had
the
dissent
of
judge
keating
in
the
kulis
case
and
judge
fuld
subsequent
dissent
in
harris
or
i
shouldn’t
say
dissent,
i
should
say
concurring
opinion
indicating
his
adherence
to
the
dissent
in
harris
--
in
that
kulis
indicates
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
authority.
and
as
i
think
my
brief
had
shown
you
every
federal
circuit
court
in
the
country
that
has
considered
this
and
there
are
six
of
them
has
reached
the
view
which
i
respectfully
espouse
today.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
exactly,
but
i
also
said
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
exactly.
i
say
further
to
that.
i
say
that
when
you
foreclose
a
defendant
from
proving
involuntariness,
it
is
ill
to
lie
in
your
mouth
to
say
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
as
the
briefs
continually
urged
for
that
was
the
very
thing
that
we
raised
and
we
prevent
it
from
questioning.
and
i
would
say
to
you
that
this
was
no
light
question
that
we
raised
because
the
statement
itself
intrinsically
bore
evidence
of
a
very
clever
prior
questioning
which
may
well
have
been
delivered,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
but
the
warnings
were
not
given.
thanks
to
judge
dempsey’s
elicitation
of
that
fact.
and
what
happened
was,
we
had
a
secret
inquisition,
something
in
the
nature
of
a
subtle
star
chamber
proceeding
and
then
we
proceed
to
a
recorded
statement
for
posterity
which
is
the
one
we’re
not
afraid
to
show
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that’s
wrong.
i
think
it’s
very
much
like
the
cases
were
you
have
probable
cause
and,
search
and
seizure
and
then
police
come
in
and
testify
that
all
of
the
sudden
defendants
are
dropping
things
on
the
side
work
in
front
of
them,
which
they
then
pick
up.
it’s
too
convenient.
and
i
say
one
of
the
district
attorney,
not
just
an
average
police
officer,
but
an
educated
man
and
an
experienced
lawyer,
deliberately
interrogates
privately
and
then
publicly,
that
circumstance
is
suspect.
now
when
it
came
to
the
trial,
i
think
it’s
conceded
that
all
of
the
proper
objections
were
made,
certainly
the
new
york
courts
treated
them
that
way.
and
when
it
came
to
verdict,
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
as
to
the
first
count
which
was
an
identical
sale
and
i
subsequently
had
that
dismissed
during
the
appellate
process
for
lack
of
prosecution.
as
to
the
second
count,
which
i
believe
the
distinction
is
explained
by
the
affected
statement
itself,
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
six
to
eight
years.
he
served
that
sentence.
he’s
out
on
parole
and
so
at
the
present
time,
he
is
technically
in
custody
but
in
fact,
i
supposed
he
phrased,
would
be
alive
and
well
in
new
york.
i
would
like
to
discuss
first
the
--
taking
first
this
statement
and
the
matter
of
which
it
was
obtained,
i
think
it
was
clearly
illegally
obtained
and
i
point
out
respectfully
that
that
was
conceded
all
the
way
to
the
new
york
courts.
it
was
treated
as
such.
it
was
not
conceded
to
be
involuntary
in
the
classic
sense
but
by
a
foreclosure
from
it,
by
the
trial
judge’s
reading
of
kulis
as
allowing
this
in
an
involuntary
case.
i
think
that
is
the
posture
in
which
this
case
comes
before
this
court.
now
i
say
that
when
a
thing
is
unconstitutionally
obtained,
it
is
inadmissible
for
any
purpose.
but
i
don’t
mean
merely
inadmissible,
i
mean
it
may
not
be
used
against
–-
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
i
am
judge
but
i
think
it
can
also
be
read
consistently
with
the
position
that
i
take.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
that
was
the
first
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes.
what
happened
was,
in
walder
that
they
had
seized
certain
narcotics.
mr.
walder
moved
to
suppress
and
made
an
affidavit
that
he
in
fact
had
him
in
his
possession,
and
it
was
that
affidavit
that
was
subsequently
used
against
him.
now,
i
think
in
your
simmons
case
clearly
says,
that
that
procedure
is
no
longer
permissible.
but
i
think
that
escobedo
itself
and
the
language
that
any
statement
elicit
by
the
police
during
the
interrogation
may
not
be
used
against
him.
i
think
that
word
means
exactly
what
it
says.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no,
i
didn’t
say
that
walder
have
been
overruled.
i
said,
i
think
simmons
(voice
overlap)
removed
the
rationale
from
walder
and
i
would
like
to
explore
that
if
i
may
judge.
i
think
this.
first,
walder
was
the
case
in
which
the
impeaching
material
itself
was
not
addressed
to
the
merits
of
the
crime
with
which
walder
was
then
charged.
it
related
solely
to
evidence
of
his
general
character
on
a
previous
occasion
and
the
rule
has
always
been
that
when
a
defendant
takes
a
stand,
evidence
of
his
general
character
is
made
relevant.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes
it
was,
this
was
evidence
of
a
prior
offense
and
to
some
extent,
perhaps,
a
predisposition
to
commit
this
type
of
offense,
but
it
was
not
evidence
of
this
charge.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
that’s
correct.
it
was
admitted
solely
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
because
he
went
beyond
the
latitude
of
the
denial
of
the
charges
itself.
it’s
not
been
said
that
viven
harris
did
that.
but
even
if
he
had,
i’m
suggesting
this,
that
walder
itself
was
a
statement.
the
one
that
was
admitted
which
had
not
itself
been
obtained
illegally.
it
was
only
in
the
simmons
sense
that
it
was
obtained
illegally,
namely
he
had
to
make
it
in
order
to
exercise
a
constitutional
right
to
suppress
something
which
in
turn
was
illegally
seized.
moreover,
i
think
that
if
you
could
impeach
him
with
the
signed
statement
as
the
case
that’s
here,
why
can’t
you
admit
the
signed
statement
in
evidence
and
just
hand
it
to
the
jury.
i
think
what
was
done
here
was
the
same
thing
and
i
think
that
the
advice
in
walder
is
that
you
are
more
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
a
single
instance
of
perjury
or
lying,
than
you
are
with
myriad
instances
of
vindicating
the
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination
and
deprivation
of
counsel.
i
think
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
things,
it
comes
about
through
the
rule
announced
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
that
when
you
take
it
down
to
the
level
of
your
neighborhood
police
officer.
he
is
going
to
say,
“well,
it
doesn’t
matter
if
i
make
a
mistake
under
the
miranda
rules
anymore
because
there’s
always
something
i
can
use
it
for.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no,
i
disagree
with
that
because
it
also
has
a
value
in
discouraging
him
from
ever
taking
the
stand.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
only
situation
in
which
it
can
arise
your
honor,
that’s
the
implication
of
the
respondent
and
amicus
briefs
but
i
think
this.
very
often
when
a
young
and
inexperienced
person
is
before
the
police,
and
that’s
what
happened
here
and
that’s
the
only
case
it
makes
a
difference
because
a
professional
criminal
just
doesn’t
get
involve
in
this.
he
may
give
a
full
exculpatory
statement
whereas
the
truth
would
acquit
him.
but
he
doesn’t
know
that.
and
he’s
afraid
to
tell
the
police
what
happened,
he
thinks
he
better
talk
to
his
lawyer
first.
so
he
makes
up
a
false
exculpatory
statement.
he
can
be
torn
to
shreds
at
the
trial
by
in
inexperienced
prosecutor
and
that’s
just
what
happened
here.
but
it
doesn’t
prove
that
the
statement
that
he
makes
in
his
testimony
at
the
trial
is
false
because
it
may
well
be
at
the
statement
unconstitutionally
obtained
was
false.
when
you
forbid
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
how
can
you
then
come
with
good
grades
and
say
he
willingly
gave
his
true
statement.
i
think
that
in
the
unique
factual
setting
of
this
case,
the
difficulty
on
the
merits
that
is
the
substantive
view
that
i
take
was
compounded
by
the
procedural
refusal
to
ever
have
a
hearing
which
could
have
determined
once
and
for
all
the
voluntariness
or
involuntariness
of
his
statement.
and
i
emphasize
again
that
one
of
the
most
serious
things
in
this
case
is
that
the
question
of
voluntariness
was
not
lightly
or
haphazardly
raised.
it
had
its
germination
in
the
statement
itself
which
showed
what
had
happened
and
in
judge
dempsey’s
question
to
mr.
facelle
about
those
warnings.
now,
i
have
referred
to
the
various
cases
in
the
circuit
courts
discussing
the
view
that
this
court
took
in
miranda.
i
don’t
wish
to
belabor
them
but
i
will
point
out
that
in
neither
brief
is
there
one
word
distinguishing
any
of
those
six
cases.
of
those
six
cases,
five
dealt
directly
with
impeachment
and
the
sixth
was
a
case
of
impeachment
by
rebuttal
rather
than
by
cross-examination.
there
are
a
number
of
state
cases
which
support
the
same
view.
but
the
argument
i
make
basically
is
in
the
words
of
former
chief
justice
white
in
burgett
against
texas.
i
think
this
case
is
a
rule
which
erodes
the
procedural
rights
of
the
defendants
and
assumes
avalanche
proportion,
just
burying
beneath
it
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
you
can
completely
destroy
the
ability
to
tell
which
statement
was
true
and
what
happened
on
the
merits
and
i
go
back
to
krulewitch
and
mr.
justice
jackson,
where
he
says,
“the
naive
assumption
that
prejudicial
effects
can
be
overcome
by
instructions
to
the
jury
all
practicing
lawyers
know
to
be
unmitigated
fiction.”
well
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
was
what
brewton
stood
for.
and
i
think
in
this
case,
it
would
be
equally
naive
to
assume
that
jury
could
put
that
second
aspect
of
the
confession.
that
is
the
confession
that
is
related
to
the
second
count
out
of
their
minds
as
a
substantive
thing.
as
my
brief
indicates,
i
don’t
think
judge
dempsey
did
that.
i
think
that
when
he
charged
them,
agency
on
the
first
count,
he
was
taking
the
substantive
material
from
the
concession
itself,
the
statement
itself.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
well,
i
will
say
this,
i
think
--
i
think
the
opinion
in
johnson
indicated
that
miranda
could
have
been
fully
retroactive.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
because
in
that
posture,
could
they
possibly
have
denied
us
the
hearing
on
voluntariness.
even
then,
the
procedural
defect
in
this
case
is
so
great
that
we
would
be
hear
on
that
second
point
in
any
event.
i
think
myself
justice
blackmun
that
we
would
be
here
on
the
first
point.
because
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
even
under
escobedo,
an
argument
could
be
fairly
be
made
that
the
overruling
of
the
defendants
request
for
counsel
at
that
point
was
an
unfair,
improper
under
the
then
law
taking
of
an
involuntary
statement.
now,
with
the
court’s
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
mr.
duggan
and
i
have
stipulated
at
this.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
it
is.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
i
only
say
to
you
that
we
never
had
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
establish
otherwise
despite
our
request.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
your
honor,
you
have
to
appreciate
first
that
i
was
assigned
by
the
court
in
the
appellate
division
so
that
i
do
not
know
what
transpired
at
the
trial.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
in
the
record,
i
can
only
say
that
every
attempt
to
explore
that
was
forbidden
because
in
the
trial
judges,
it
deal
with
--
it
made
no
difference,
even
if
it
was
involuntary.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
the
miranda
point
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
well,
i
can
only
say
to
you
that
the
miranda
point
was
raised
and
not
explored
because
what
happened
was
that
the
trial
judge
told
the
prosecutor,
“you
can
do
this
but
you
run
the
risk
that
an
appellate
court
will
overturn
in
under
miranda.”
judge,
the
only
way
i
can
express
it
to
you
is
this.
many
trial
judges
in
my
experience
will
say,
if
i
have
a
doubt
on
this
ruling,
i
will
allow
the
prosecution
to
do
it
because
they
can
appeal.
and
then
let
the
defendant
take
his
appeal
and
will
find
out
what
the
law
really
is.
for
viven
harris,
that’s
some
five
years
of
prison
finding
out.
and
it
may
just
be
that
he
was
right.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
would
agree
that
that
would
be
true,
if
in
fact
that
was
the
thrust
and
effect
of
what
happen
your
honor.
but
i
say
this,
you
are
insulating
him
in
a
very
small
degree.
you’re
insulating
him
from
something
which
the
prosecution
had
no
right
to
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i’m
grateful
your
honor
that
this
court
stands
as
a
shield
against
that
view.
i
would
simply
say
that
when
that
misapprehension
is
suffered
by
many,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
a
great
deal
to
lay
to
rest
that
misassumption.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
would
like
to
way
first
your
honor
that
somehow
in
the
argument
and
perhaps
it’s
because
my
brother,
mr.
duggan
was
a
little
too
enthusiastic,
we
lost
sight
of
the
material
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
the
footer
page
69
and
at
the
top
of
page
70.
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
says,
“your
honor,
i
take
strong
objection
to
the
procedure
herein.”
this
was
presented
to
the
jury
before
any
examination
so
that
the
legal
voluntariness
of
this
statement,
ands
the
judge
says,
“let
the
record
reflect
for
you
that
you
are
taking
an
exception
to
the
fact
that
under
the
huntley
case
which
is
voluntariness,
it
was
not
authored
on
the
basis
of
notice
required
under
the
code
criminal
procedure
and
you
also
have
an
exception
under
the
fact
that
it
violates
miranda
against
arizona.”
so,
i
say
to
you
that
i
think
the
record
bears
out
my
statement
to
mr.
justice
stewart
in
response
to
his
question
that
we
fairly
sought
the
hearing.
there
was
no
hearing
in
chambers,
your
honor.
what
there
was,
was
a
discussion
during
which
judge
dempsey
asked,
“mr.
facelle,
did
you
give
this
man
any
warning?”
other
than
what’s
in
that
statement
and
the
answer
was
“no.”
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
authored
judge
is
where
i
have
my
trouble
because,
i
stipulated
and
i
conceded
in
my
brief
that
it
wasn’t
authored
in
the
sense
i’ve
marked
this
exhibit
i
have
handed
to
the
jury,
no
it
was
not.
judge
dempsey
again,
i
can’t
express
my
admiration
for
him
enough,
marked
it
solely
as
an
exhibit
to
have
it
exactly
before
you.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
was
read
visibly
by
the
prosecutor
in
its
entirety.
eight
pages
to
read
a
statement
that
took
six
pages.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no
he
left
out.
no,
there
were
some
where
--
one
where
he
said
“yes,”
one
where
he
said
“i
don’t
recall,”
one
where
he
said
“i
didn’t
make
that
statement,”
they
vary.
but
the
thing
that
was
significant
was
he
got
the
entire
thing
in
there
and
in
part
of
the
question,
he
says
to
them,
“when,
you
told
me
that
was
a
true.”
true,
that
was
the
word
that
mr.
facelle
used.
and
maybe
the
jury
lost
the
significance
of
the
difference,
but
while
on
the
one
hand,
ms.
landau
says
they
know
what
was
going
on,
on
page
15
of
her
brief,
she
says
they
must
have
been
confused
or
they
wouldn’t
have
acquitted
him
on
the
first
count.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no,
he
did
not
in
his
statement
say
it.
but
i
would
close
this
case
now
if
i
may
with
the
statement
that
comes
from
the
harrison
case
that,
“the
rule
for
which
i
contend
deprives
the
government
of
nothing
to
which
it
has
any
legitimate
claim.
it
does
no
more
than
restore
the
status
quo
that
would
have
prevailed
if
the
government
had
obeyed
the
law.”
i
commend
that
to
you.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
thank
you.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
arrested
on
january
7
of
1966
and
subsequently
charged
in
a
two-count
indictment
with
two
identical
counts
of
sale
of
a
narcotic
drug
to
an
undercover
agent,
the
same
undercover
agent,
two
days
apart.
and
these
two
offenses
occurred
allegedly
the
day
before
and
three
days
before
the
date
of
his
arrest.
after
his
arrest
and
the
time
factor
in
not
found
in
the
record,
he
was
removed
to
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
of
westchester
county
at
our
courthouse.
and
there,
in
the
presence
of
a
number
of
law
enforcement
officers,
detectives,
assistant
district
attorneys
and
so
forth,
and
a
stenographer,
a
written
statement
was
taken
from
him
which
does
appear
in
its
entirety
in
the
record
before
you.
however,
that
statement
itself
discloses
that
it
followed
a
period
of
questioning,
the
length
of
which
is
never
disclosed
by
the
same
district
attorney,
same
law
enforcement
officers
and
there
is
no
place
in
this
record
where
the
facts
of
the
prior
questioning
are
elicited.
it
so
happen
that
this
case
was
tried
before
one
of
our
most
beloved
and
respected
judges
and
when
the
statement
came
up,
he,
realizing
precisely
the
point
that
was
at
issue,
the
difference
between
the
miranda
view
of
impeachment
that
i
take
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals’
view
in
the
kulis
case
asked
the
prosecutor
who
tried
the
case,
who
was
the
same
prosecutor
who
took
the
statement,
“mr.
facelle,
did
you
give
this
man
any
warning
other
than
appears
in
this
statement?”
and
the
prosecutor
said,
he
had
not.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
judge
robert
e.
dempsey,
your
honor.
now,
what
that
meant
was
that
couple
with
the
statement
itself
which
shows
you
in
repeated
places
the
prosecutor
says
to
him,
“all
i
want
you
to
do
is
tell
us
what
you
already
told
us
before.”
and
mr.
harris,
well,
he
was
23
years
old.
he
did
have
a
10th
grade
education.
such
as
it
was,
he
was
an
addict
and
he
was
suffering
from
withdrawal
syndromes.
and
mr.
harris
said
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
questioned
without
warnings
and
he
was
now
being
questioned
by
a
reporter,
he
said
“i’d
like
to
see
a
lawyer.”
he
said,
“i
don’t
think
i
should
keep
on
before
i
see
a
lawyer.”
and
at
that
point,
mr.
facelle
told
him
that
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
a
lawyer.
he
said,
“i’ll
have
him
taken
out.
he
can
get
a
lawyer.”
but
the
petitioner
was
indigent.
he
had
no
prior
felony
convictions.
he
had
minimal
involvement
with
the
law
in
my
view
and
i
don’t
think
for
a
moment
that
he
understood
either
that
he
had
a
right
to
cancel
then
and
there
or
that
he
had
a
right
to
free
counsel
then
and
there,
and
his
answer
is
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
at
that
date,
your
honor,
miranda
had
not
come
down
and
the
standard
had
not
been
explicitly
decided.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
my
view
and
i
commend
to
you
that
escobedo
was
in
existence
at
that
time.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
but
the
opinion
which
i
believe
your
honor
wrote
said
that
confession
obtained
under
such
circumstances
could
not
be
used.
that
was
the
word
you
used
and
i
prefer
to
admissibility
because
“used”
and
“admissibility”
have
some
distinctions
in
this
case.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
when
he
asked
for
a
lawyer,
it
was
not
only
a
question
of
rights
were
available
to
him
because
he
didn’t
appreciate
what
they
were
at
all.
but
the
prosecutor
did
lo
and
behold
,when
you
get
to
the
end
of
this
statement,
the
prosecutor
says
to
him,
“by
the
way,
when
you
kept
on
going
after
you
asked
for
a
lawyer,
you
meant
to
waive
a
lawyer,
didn’t
you?”
and
viven
harris
said,
“huh?”
he
didn’t
understand.
and
the
young
lady
from
new
york
county
makes
a
point
in
her
brief
that
they
explained
it
to
him.
well,
they
told
him
what
the
word
waiver
meant
but
they
didn’t
tell
him
a
thing
about
the
consequences
of
it,
not
three-word
explanation.
so
mr.
harris
found
himself
in
what
i
believe
to
be
the
situation
of
the
type
of
defendant
that
you
have
been
most
alert
to
protect,
one
who
is
in
no
position
to
comprehend
or
to
appreciate
what
right
it
is
he
said
to
have
waived
because
he
doesn’t
understand
the
nature
of
it
at
that
time.
now,
when
you
come
to
the
question
of
fairness
to
law
enforcement
officers,
it
is
suggested
that
well,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
raised,
maybe
that
wasn’t
the
law
at
the
time.
i
think
that
law
was
reasonably
inferable
from
what
this
court
had
been
doing
and
i
think
the
prosecutor
did
infer
or
he
wouldn’t
have
asked
him
about
the
waiver
which
is
the
traditional
way
of
trying
to
get
around
miranda.
but
something
more
important
happened
and
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court
in
johnson,
because
on
the
day
that
mr.
harris
came
to
trial,
there
wasn’t
any
question
about
what
the
law
was.
his
legal
aid
attorney
try
one
of
his
first
cases,
knew
exactly
what
the
law
was
and
made
the
proper
objections.
the
judge
and
perhaps
it’s
the
reason
we
respect
him
so
highly,
pointed
out
to
the
prosecuting
attorneys
that
if
you
do
this,
it
will
have
to
be
decided
in
an
appellate
court.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
judge.
i
have
to
explain
that
in
terms
of
the
respective
positions,
judge
blackmun
that
each
of
the
parties
herein.
miss
landau
in
the
new
york
county
brief
makes
the
unequivocal
statement
that
as
to
one
date
it’s
true
and
as
to
one
date
it
is
not
true.
mr.
duggan
makes
the
statement
in
the
westchester
county
brief
that
the
jury
must
have
believed
him
or
they
would
have
convicted
on
both
counts
rather
than
solely
on
the
second
count.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
i
would
like
to
explain
my
view
on
that
and
perhaps
your
question
makes
this
the
appropriate
time.
i
think
that
what
happened
was
this.
the
statement
have
vast
difference
intrinsically
as
to
the
two
counts.
on
the
first
count,
the
statement
indicated
that
viven
harris
had
acted
solely
as
the
agent
of
the
police
officer.
that
is
the
agent
desire
to
make
the
buy,
the
agent
paid
for
it.
viven
harris
derived
nothing
from
the
act
of
being
a
conduit.
and
in
fact,
judge
dempsey
expressly
charged
the
jury
that
if
they
found
him
to
be
an
agent,
they
must
acquit.
i
think
that
happened.
on
the
second
count
however,
it
was
unbelievably
damming
in
this
sense,
petitioner’s
testimony
at
the
trial
was,
that
he
had
in
fact
through
a
scheme
and
deception
provided
two
bags
of
a
substitute
for
heroin.
there’s
no
heroin
in
these
bags
at
all
which
he
gave.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
believe
that’s
correct
judge,
by
the
point
was
it
had
just
enough
for
of
a
kick
to
deceive
anybody
who
was
a
snorter
which
was
their
impression
of
what
detective
bermudas
was
masquerading
(voice
overlap).
however,
the
statement
contained
the
suggestion
that
not
only
that
did
he
get
monetary
payment
for
it,
but
he
got
a
taste
of
heroin
from
those
two
bags.
it
meant
that
the
entire
statement
would
be
meaningless
unless
in
fact
there
was
heroin
in
those
two
little
bags.
now,
mr.
duggan
has
suggested
that
it
wasn’t
so
significant
as
to
the
second
count
because
how
could
he
refuse
the
heroin
that
was
offered
to
him
without
giving
away
the
game
that
they
were
playing.
the
answer
is
that
you
cannot
find
in
this
record
that
it
was
ever
offered
to
him.
what
you
find
is
that
he
took
it
in
payment
but
you
do
not
find
any
testimony
that
bermudez,
the
detective,
offered
this
to
him
voluntarily.
he
wanted
it
as
far
as
appears
from
the
statement.
now
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
we
disagree
on
that
your
honor
(voice
overlap).
as
to
the
second
count
–-
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
as
to
the
second
count.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
because
it
indicated:
(a)
that
he
had
furnished
the
heroin
and
(b)
that
by
taking
back
a
taste,
it
was
in
fact
heroin
that
he
had
furnished
and
received
money
for.
and
that
is
his
honor
charged
to
jury
under
the
statute
would
be
sufficient
to
convict
in
new
york.
so
as
to
the
second
count
judge,
and
i’m
limiting
myself
to
the
second
count
respectfully,
i
think
in
fact
it
was
a
confession.
but
in
any
event,
certainly
an
admission,
and
when
you
come
down
to
that
–-
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
excuse
me,
your
honor.
no,
i’m
suggesting
something
quite
different
your
honor,
i’m
suggesting
that
it
had
a
separate
independent
effect
when
combined
with
his
testimony
that
demonstrate
the
possibility
of
falsehood.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
either
at
the
time
of
the
prior
statement
of
the
trial.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
but
it
also
had
an
independent
evil
effect
of
it’s
own
as
a
confession
and
i
would
not
have
you
think
i
conceive
in
anyway
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
that’s
right.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
unfortunately
judge,
that
aspect
of
the
record
was
foreclosed
by
the
prosecution.
now,
mr.
prudanski,
the
young
man
who
tried
this
case
for
legal
aid
made
such
an
objection
and
he
made
it
by
referring
to
jackson
against
denno
and
to
section
813
(f)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
in
new
york
which
is
the
statute
dealing
with
the
hearing
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
the
prosecutor
objected
at
that
time
and
certainly
new
york
county,
at
least
still
takes
the
position
that
it
makes
no
difference
what
happens
at
a
voluntariness
hearing
because
you
can
just
proceed
to
impeach
him
with
it
anyhow
even
if
it’s
involuntary,
in
the
mcnabb
situation
for
example.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
well,
that’s
what
i’m
--
i’m
sorry
if
i’ve
been
wordy
judge,
i
didn’t
mean
to
evade.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
when
we
attempted
to
raise
it
in
new
york,
when
we
asked
for
a
hearing
on
that
issue,
we
were
foreclosed
by
the
prosecution’s
objection
that
the
result
of
such
a
voluntariness
hearing
wouldn’t
prevent
him
from
using
it.
and
the
trial
judge
is
learned
and
wonderful
as
he
was.
he
is
a
wonderful
man,
he
agreed
with
that
of
the
authority
of
kulis
but
having
read
miranda,
he
told
mr.
facelle
that
you
face
the
problem
and
the
appellate
court
may
very
well
determine
that
this
is
not
permissible.
and
of
course
he
had
the
dissent
of
judge
keating
in
the
kulis
case
and
judge
fuld
subsequent
dissent
in
harris
or
i
shouldn’t
say
dissent,
i
should
say
concurring
opinion
indicating
his
adherence
to
the
dissent
in
harris
--
in
that
kulis
indicates
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
authority.
and
as
i
think
my
brief
had
shown
you
every
federal
circuit
court
in
the
country
that
has
considered
this
and
there
are
six
of
them
has
reached
the
view
which
i
respectfully
espouse
today.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
exactly,
but
i
also
said
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
exactly.
i
say
further
to
that.
i
say
that
when
you
foreclose
a
defendant
from
proving
involuntariness,
it
is
ill
to
lie
in
your
mouth
to
say
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
as
the
briefs
continually
urged
for
that
was
the
very
thing
that
we
raised
and
we
prevent
it
from
questioning.
and
i
would
say
to
you
that
this
was
no
light
question
that
we
raised
because
the
statement
itself
intrinsically
bore
evidence
of
a
very
clever
prior
questioning
which
may
well
have
been
delivered,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
but
the
warnings
were
not
given.
thanks
to
judge
dempsey’s
elicitation
of
that
fact.
and
what
happened
was,
we
had
a
secret
inquisition,
something
in
the
nature
of
a
subtle
star
chamber
proceeding
and
then
we
proceed
to
a
recorded
statement
for
posterity
which
is
the
one
we’re
not
afraid
to
show
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that’s
wrong.
i
think
it’s
very
much
like
the
cases
were
you
have
probable
cause
and,
search
and
seizure
and
then
police
come
in
and
testify
that
all
of
the
sudden
defendants
are
dropping
things
on
the
side
work
in
front
of
them,
which
they
then
pick
up.
it’s
too
convenient.
and
i
say
one
of
the
district
attorney,
not
just
an
average
police
officer,
but
an
educated
man
and
an
experienced
lawyer,
deliberately
interrogates
privately
and
then
publicly,
that
circumstance
is
suspect.
now
when
it
came
to
the
trial,
i
think
it’s
conceded
that
all
of
the
proper
objections
were
made,
certainly
the
new
york
courts
treated
them
that
way.
and
when
it
came
to
verdict,
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
as
to
the
first
count
which
was
an
identical
sale
and
i
subsequently
had
that
dismissed
during
the
appellate
process
for
lack
of
prosecution.
as
to
the
second
count,
which
i
believe
the
distinction
is
explained
by
the
affected
statement
itself,
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
six
to
eight
years.
he
served
that
sentence.
he’s
out
on
parole
and
so
at
the
present
time,
he
is
technically
in
custody
but
in
fact,
i
supposed
he
phrased,
would
be
alive
and
well
in
new
york.
i
would
like
to
discuss
first
the
--
taking
first
this
statement
and
the
matter
of
which
it
was
obtained,
i
think
it
was
clearly
illegally
obtained
and
i
point
out
respectfully
that
that
was
conceded
all
the
way
to
the
new
york
courts.
it
was
treated
as
such.
it
was
not
conceded
to
be
involuntary
in
the
classic
sense
but
by
a
foreclosure
from
it,
by
the
trial
judge’s
reading
of
kulis
as
allowing
this
in
an
involuntary
case.
i
think
that
is
the
posture
in
which
this
case
comes
before
this
court.
now
i
say
that
when
a
thing
is
unconstitutionally
obtained,
it
is
inadmissible
for
any
purpose.
but
i
don’t
mean
merely
inadmissible,
i
mean
it
may
not
be
used
against
–-
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
i
am
judge
but
i
think
it
can
also
be
read
consistently
with
the
position
that
i
take.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
that
was
the
first
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes.
what
happened
was,
in
walder
that
they
had
seized
certain
narcotics.
mr.
walder
moved
to
suppress
and
made
an
affidavit
that
he
in
fact
had
him
in
his
possession,
and
it
was
that
affidavit
that
was
subsequently
used
against
him.
now,
i
think
in
your
simmons
case
clearly
says,
that
that
procedure
is
no
longer
permissible.
but
i
think
that
escobedo
itself
and
the
language
that
any
statement
elicit
by
the
police
during
the
interrogation
may
not
be
used
against
him.
i
think
that
word
means
exactly
what
it
says.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no,
i
didn’t
say
that
walder
have
been
overruled.
i
said,
i
think
simmons
(voice
overlap)
removed
the
rationale
from
walder
and
i
would
like
to
explore
that
if
i
may
judge.
i
think
this.
first,
walder
was
the
case
in
which
the
impeaching
material
itself
was
not
addressed
to
the
merits
of
the
crime
with
which
walder
was
then
charged.
it
related
solely
to
evidence
of
his
general
character
on
a
previous
occasion
and
the
rule
has
always
been
that
when
a
defendant
takes
a
stand,
evidence
of
his
general
character
is
made
relevant.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes
it
was,
this
was
evidence
of
a
prior
offense
and
to
some
extent,
perhaps,
a
predisposition
to
commit
this
type
of
offense,
but
it
was
not
evidence
of
this
charge.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
that’s
correct.
it
was
admitted
solely
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
because
he
went
beyond
the
latitude
of
the
denial
of
the
charges
itself.
it’s
not
been
said
that
viven
harris
did
that.
but
even
if
he
had,
i’m
suggesting
this,
that
walder
itself
was
a
statement.
the
one
that
was
admitted
which
had
not
itself
been
obtained
illegally.
it
was
only
in
the
simmons
sense
that
it
was
obtained
illegally,
namely
he
had
to
make
it
in
order
to
exercise
a
constitutional
right
to
suppress
something
which
in
turn
was
illegally
seized.
moreover,
i
think
that
if
you
could
impeach
him
with
the
signed
statement
as
the
case
that’s
here,
why
can’t
you
admit
the
signed
statement
in
evidence
and
just
hand
it
to
the
jury.
i
think
what
was
done
here
was
the
same
thing
and
i
think
that
the
advice
in
walder
is
that
you
are
more
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
a
single
instance
of
perjury
or
lying,
than
you
are
with
myriad
instances
of
vindicating
the
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination
and
deprivation
of
counsel.
i
think
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
things,
it
comes
about
through
the
rule
announced
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
that
when
you
take
it
down
to
the
level
of
your
neighborhood
police
officer.
he
is
going
to
say,
“well,
it
doesn’t
matter
if
i
make
a
mistake
under
the
miranda
rules
anymore
because
there’s
always
something
i
can
use
it
for.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no,
i
disagree
with
that
because
it
also
has
a
value
in
discouraging
him
from
ever
taking
the
stand.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
only
situation
in
which
it
can
arise
your
honor,
that’s
the
implication
of
the
respondent
and
amicus
briefs
but
i
think
this.
very
often
when
a
young
and
inexperienced
person
is
before
the
police,
and
that’s
what
happened
here
and
that’s
the
only
case
it
makes
a
difference
because
a
professional
criminal
just
doesn’t
get
involve
in
this.
he
may
give
a
full
exculpatory
statement
whereas
the
truth
would
acquit
him.
but
he
doesn’t
know
that.
and
he’s
afraid
to
tell
the
police
what
happened,
he
thinks
he
better
talk
to
his
lawyer
first.
so
he
makes
up
a
false
exculpatory
statement.
he
can
be
torn
to
shreds
at
the
trial
by
in
inexperienced
prosecutor
and
that’s
just
what
happened
here.
but
it
doesn’t
prove
that
the
statement
that
he
makes
in
his
testimony
at
the
trial
is
false
because
it
may
well
be
at
the
statement
unconstitutionally
obtained
was
false.
when
you
forbid
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
how
can
you
then
come
with
good
grades
and
say
he
willingly
gave
his
true
statement.
i
think
that
in
the
unique
factual
setting
of
this
case,
the
difficulty
on
the
merits
that
is
the
substantive
view
that
i
take
was
compounded
by
the
procedural
refusal
to
ever
have
a
hearing
which
could
have
determined
once
and
for
all
the
voluntariness
or
involuntariness
of
his
statement.
and
i
emphasize
again
that
one
of
the
most
serious
things
in
this
case
is
that
the
question
of
voluntariness
was
not
lightly
or
haphazardly
raised.
it
had
its
germination
in
the
statement
itself
which
showed
what
had
happened
and
in
judge
dempsey’s
question
to
mr.
facelle
about
those
warnings.
now,
i
have
referred
to
the
various
cases
in
the
circuit
courts
discussing
the
view
that
this
court
took
in
miranda.
i
don’t
wish
to
belabor
them
but
i
will
point
out
that
in
neither
brief
is
there
one
word
distinguishing
any
of
those
six
cases.
of
those
six
cases,
five
dealt
directly
with
impeachment
and
the
sixth
was
a
case
of
impeachment
by
rebuttal
rather
than
by
cross-examination.
there
are
a
number
of
state
cases
which
support
the
same
view.
but
the
argument
i
make
basically
is
in
the
words
of
former
chief
justice
white
in
burgett
against
texas.
i
think
this
case
is
a
rule
which
erodes
the
procedural
rights
of
the
defendants
and
assumes
avalanche
proportion,
just
burying
beneath
it
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
you
can
completely
destroy
the
ability
to
tell
which
statement
was
true
and
what
happened
on
the
merits
and
i
go
back
to
krulewitch
and
mr.
justice
jackson,
where
he
says,
“the
naive
assumption
that
prejudicial
effects
can
be
overcome
by
instructions
to
the
jury
all
practicing
lawyers
know
to
be
unmitigated
fiction.”
well
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
was
what
brewton
stood
for.
and
i
think
in
this
case,
it
would
be
equally
naive
to
assume
that
jury
could
put
that
second
aspect
of
the
confession.
that
is
the
confession
that
is
related
to
the
second
count
out
of
their
minds
as
a
substantive
thing.
as
my
brief
indicates,
i
don’t
think
judge
dempsey
did
that.
i
think
that
when
he
charged
them,
agency
on
the
first
count,
he
was
taking
the
substantive
material
from
the
concession
itself,
the
statement
itself.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
well,
i
will
say
this,
i
think
--
i
think
the
opinion
in
johnson
indicated
that
miranda
could
have
been
fully
retroactive.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
because
in
that
posture,
could
they
possibly
have
denied
us
the
hearing
on
voluntariness.
even
then,
the
procedural
defect
in
this
case
is
so
great
that
we
would
be
hear
on
that
second
point
in
any
event.
i
think
myself
justice
blackmun
that
we
would
be
here
on
the
first
point.
because
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
even
under
escobedo,
an
argument
could
be
fairly
be
made
that
the
overruling
of
the
defendants
request
for
counsel
at
that
point
was
an
unfair,
improper
under
the
then
law
taking
of
an
involuntary
statement.
now,
with
the
court’s
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
mr.
duggan
and
i
have
stipulated
at
this.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
it
is.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
yes,
i
only
say
to
you
that
we
never
had
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
establish
otherwise
despite
our
request.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
your
honor,
you
have
to
appreciate
first
that
i
was
assigned
by
the
court
in
the
appellate
division
so
that
i
do
not
know
what
transpired
at
the
trial.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
in
the
record,
i
can
only
say
that
every
attempt
to
explore
that
was
forbidden
because
in
the
trial
judges,
it
deal
with
--
it
made
no
difference,
even
if
it
was
involuntary.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
the
miranda
point
--
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
well,
i
can
only
say
to
you
that
the
miranda
point
was
raised
and
not
explored
because
what
happened
was
that
the
trial
judge
told
the
prosecutor,
“you
can
do
this
but
you
run
the
risk
that
an
appellate
court
will
overturn
in
under
miranda.”
judge,
the
only
way
i
can
express
it
to
you
is
this.
many
trial
judges
in
my
experience
will
say,
if
i
have
a
doubt
on
this
ruling,
i
will
allow
the
prosecution
to
do
it
because
they
can
appeal.
and
then
let
the
defendant
take
his
appeal
and
will
find
out
what
the
law
really
is.
for
viven
harris,
that’s
some
five
years
of
prison
finding
out.
and
it
may
just
be
that
he
was
right.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
would
agree
that
that
would
be
true,
if
in
fact
that
was
the
thrust
and
effect
of
what
happen
your
honor.
but
i
say
this,
you
are
insulating
him
in
a
very
small
degree.
you’re
insulating
him
from
something
which
the
prosecution
had
no
right
to
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i’m
grateful
your
honor
that
this
court
stands
as
a
shield
against
that
view.
i
would
simply
say
that
when
that
misapprehension
is
suffered
by
many,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
a
great
deal
to
lay
to
rest
that
misassumption.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
i
would
like
to
way
first
your
honor
that
somehow
in
the
argument
and
perhaps
it’s
because
my
brother,
mr.
duggan
was
a
little
too
enthusiastic,
we
lost
sight
of
the
material
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
the
footer
page
69
and
at
the
top
of
page
70.
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
says,
“your
honor,
i
take
strong
objection
to
the
procedure
herein.”
this
was
presented
to
the
jury
before
any
examination
so
that
the
legal
voluntariness
of
this
statement,
ands
the
judge
says,
“let
the
record
reflect
for
you
that
you
are
taking
an
exception
to
the
fact
that
under
the
huntley
case
which
is
voluntariness,
it
was
not
authored
on
the
basis
of
notice
required
under
the
code
criminal
procedure
and
you
also
have
an
exception
under
the
fact
that
it
violates
miranda
against
arizona.”
so,
i
say
to
you
that
i
think
the
record
bears
out
my
statement
to
mr.
justice
stewart
in
response
to
his
question
that
we
fairly
sought
the
hearing.
there
was
no
hearing
in
chambers,
your
honor.
what
there
was,
was
a
discussion
during
which
judge
dempsey
asked,
“mr.
facelle,
did
you
give
this
man
any
warning?”
other
than
what’s
in
that
statement
and
the
answer
was
“no.”
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
authored
judge
is
where
i
have
my
trouble
because,
i
stipulated
and
i
conceded
in
my
brief
that
it
wasn’t
authored
in
the
sense
i’ve
marked
this
exhibit
i
have
handed
to
the
jury,
no
it
was
not.
judge
dempsey
again,
i
can’t
express
my
admiration
for
him
enough,
marked
it
solely
as
an
exhibit
to
have
it
exactly
before
you.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
was
read
visibly
by
the
prosecutor
in
its
entirety.
eight
pages
to
read
a
statement
that
took
six
pages.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no
he
left
out.
no,
there
were
some
where
--
one
where
he
said
“yes,”
one
where
he
said
“i
don’t
recall,”
one
where
he
said
“i
didn’t
make
that
statement,”
they
vary.
but
the
thing
that
was
significant
was
he
got
the
entire
thing
in
there
and
in
part
of
the
question,
he
says
to
them,
“when,
you
told
me
that
was
a
true.”
true,
that
was
the
word
that
mr.
facelle
used.
and
maybe
the
jury
lost
the
significance
of
the
difference,
but
while
on
the
one
hand,
ms.
landau
says
they
know
what
was
going
on,
on
page
15
of
her
brief,
she
says
they
must
have
been
confused
or
they
wouldn’t
have
acquitted
him
on
the
first
count.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
no,
he
did
not
in
his
statement
say
it.
but
i
would
close
this
case
now
if
i
may
with
the
statement
that
comes
from
the
harrison
case
that,
“the
rule
for
which
i
contend
deprives
the
government
of
nothing
to
which
it
has
any
legitimate
claim.
it
does
no
more
than
restore
the
status
quo
that
would
have
prevailed
if
the
government
had
obeyed
the
law.”
i
commend
that
to
you.
mr.
joel
martin
aurnou
thank
you.
