we’ll

against
state
of
new
york.
mr.
aurnou,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
the
walder
case
be
overruled
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
walder
it
was
clearly
an
unconstitutional
search
as
i
recall
it
–-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
search
and
seizure,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
gone
over
that
rather
fast,
it
isn’t
as
clear
to
everyone
as
it
seems
to
be
to
use
that
the
walder
case
is
overruled.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
second,
in
the
trial
that
came
before
the
court,
when
the
decision
is
made,
that
was
another
narcotic
charge,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wasn’t
admitted
for
impeachment
on
that
purpose,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
admitted
because
he
denied
that
he
had
ever
had.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that’s
a
fact
of
life
though
if
you
got
to
--
if
you
contemplate
perjury
when
you
take
the
stand,
this
is
somewhat
discouraging.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
these
rules
that
you’re
talking
about,
all
of
them,
miranda
all
the
way
back
to
mcnabb,
these
were
traditionally
constructive
as
a
shield
that
when
a
man
can
take
the
stand
and
be
immune
from
cross-examination
and
impeachment,
he’s
using
it
something
more
than
a
shield,
isn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
some
people
think
that
there’s
been
a
little
over
insulation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
duggan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
haven’t
it
come
a
little
earlier
in
england?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you’re
saying
then
that
it
can’t
be
given
any
use
because
it
is
inherently
unreliable
as
being
involuntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
prosecution
sought
to
use
it
for
impeachment
purposes,
was
there
any
request
for
a
hearing
on
the
involuntariness
of
the
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wasn’t
--
it
never
was
offered
in
evidence,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
simply
cross-examined
on
the
basis
of
the
statements,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
only
for
appellate
review.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
landau.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
he
was
cross-examined
by
way
of
impeachment,
can
you
tell
us
now
what
his
responses
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
when
he
was
asked,
“did
you
make
this
statement?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

was
he
confronted,
verbally
or?

and
at
the
time
that
he
made
this
responses,
did
he
give
any
responses
saying,
anything
to
the
effect
that

was
forced
to
make
it
or
