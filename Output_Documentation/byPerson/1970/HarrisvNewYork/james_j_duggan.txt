mr.
james
j.
duggan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
i
think
i
can
perhaps
be
of
more
service
to
the
court
by
beginning
rather
than
what
a
formal
argument
by
answering
some
of
the
questions
that
the
justices
have
had
asked
and
perhaps
haven’t
been
answered
to
my
full
satisfaction.
when
miranda
was
decided
in
june
of
1966,
the
prosecutor
went
over
his
own
statement
and
he
evaluated
in
terms
of
the
law
by
which
he
was
obliged.
and
we
said
to
one
another
forget
the
statement
in
the
harris
case
because
we
didn’t
give
him
that
forth
warning.
so
as
a
consequence,
when
the
time
came
went
in
another
case,
we
would
observe
notice
on
the
defendant
that
we
intended
to
use
a
statement
as
evidence
against
him.
we
chose
at
that
time
not
to
serve
any
such
notice
because
it
was
not
then
our
intention
to
use
the
statement
against
him.
so
as
a
consequence
that
was
never
any
--
what
in
new
york
state
has
become
a
huntley
hearing
on
this
matter.
but
throughout
the
entire
progress
of
this
trial,
everyone
knew
and
everyone
accepted
that
this
was
a
completely
voluntary
statement
in
a
traditional
sense
of
the
word.
its
only
false
was
that
by
reason
of
miranda,
it
was
no
longer
admissible.
and
so
as
a
consequence,
when
at
the
time
of
this
statement
was
sought
to
be
introduced
for
impeachment
purposes,
and
when
i
say
introduce,
they
don’t
mean
introduce
into
evidence
because
it
was
not.
at
the
time
it
was
resorted
to
for
impeachment
purposes
and
there
was
an
objection
raised,
there
was
no
hearing
then
being
sought
on
a
traditional
concept
of
voluntariness.
the
thought
that
was
being
explored
by
holding
such
a
hearing
at
that
time
was
whether
or
nor
it
was
admissible
and
the
trial
judge
said
certainly,
everybody
knows
that
this
statement
is
not
admissible
into
evidence
because
the
people
opened
and
closed
their
case
without
ever
having
any
resort
to
this.
but
he
said
in
terms
of
people
against
kulis,
which
is
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
inadmissibility
of
the
statement
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it
may
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
and
he
said,
“therefore
gentlemen,
i
am
not
going
to
have
any
hearing
to
find
out
something
that
all
of
us
already
know.
it’s
inadmissible.”
but
granted
the
point
and
as
i
say
it
was
grated
by
all
concerned,
that
is
was
a
voluntary
statement,
it
then
certainly
became
the
same
thing
that
everybody
had
agreed
and
the
traditional
sense
was
perfectly
proper.
because
there
was
a
time
that
common
law,
when
the
defendant
was
under
no
circumstance
allowed
to
testify
on
his
own
defense,
and
this
was
thought
to
be
basically
so
because
the
defendant
had
so
much
to
lose
by
a
successful
prosecution
and
he
had
so
much
to
gain
by
a
successful
forwarding
of
that
prosecution.
but
he
was
essentially,
by
definition
unbelievable.
or
so
far
as
i
know,
the
first
break
in
that
common
law
tradition
came
in
new
york
state
in
1869,
in
that
state
for
the
first
time,
our
defendant
was
allowed
to
take
a
stand
and
it
was
there
that
the
concept
grew
up,
that
no
presumption
should
be
drawn
against
him
if
he
doesn’t.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
oh,
i
don’t
mean
--
i
am
not
going
all
the
way
back.
i’m
talking
the
statutory
turns,
your
honor.
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
following
year
was
called
upon
to
decide
the
case
under
the
new
york
law,
under
this
new
york
statute
and
they
deliberately
painted
a
defendant
as
a
double
entity.
in
one
capacity,
he
is
a
defendant
on
trial.
and
in
that
capacity,
he
has
under
most
circumstances
to
be
compelled
to
get
on
that
stand
and
get
evidence
of
anything.
however,
if
he
chooses
to
step
aside
from
that
position
as
defendant
and
become
a
witness,
he
then
becomes
as
vulnerable
and
the
subject
to
impeachment
as
any
other
witness.
and
this
was
accepted
and
it
was
accepted
in
a
great
many
jurisdictions
even
to
the
point
of
their
saying
that
even
if
we
adopt
as
a
principle,
the
possibility
that
this
man
may
be
impeached
by
inadmissible
evidence,
he
invites
that
by
taking
a
stand.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
if
this
had
been
a
coerced
confession,
it’s
that
people’s
view
and
the
respondent’s
view
that
it
couldn’t
have
been
used
for
any
purpose,
because
the
entire
thrust
or
the
only
thing
we
can
tell
to
this
court
is
that
because
if
it
is
a
voluntary
confession,
its
truth
is
greatly
to
be
relied
upon.
now,
if
you
conceive
of
a
situation
where
we
can
even
rely
on
the
truth
of
this
thing,
then
we
can’t
use
it
to
impeach
him.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don’t
think
we
could
for
this
reason.
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
make
is
a
voluntary
confession,
if
it’s
voluntary
in
traditional
sense,
can
be
relied
upon
to
express
the
truth
or
as
an
involuntary
confession
is
subject
to
take
the
obvious
example.
a
man
will
say
anything
to
keep
from
being
beaten
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
go
to
some
of
the
countries
behind
the
iron
curtain
to
demonstrate
that.
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
human
endurance
can’t
continue.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart
because
the
thought
is
that
we
must
have
to
find
a
class
of
confessions
which
may
be
used
for
these
purposes.
and
i
think
once
you
define
a
class
as
being
a
true
confession
rather
than
a
voluntary
confession,
then
you’re
getting
into
extraneous
matters
that
perhaps
aren’t
properly
explored
in
such
a
context
as
this.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
as
being
involuntary,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
you
mean,
as
i
would
choose
to
use
it
without
a
pretrial?
mr.
james
j.
duggan
oh!
by
all
means
mr.
justice
marshall!
we
would
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
oh!
by
all
means,
there
would
have
to
be
some
judicial
determination
of
that
prior
to
any
concept
of
throwing
in
this
in
this
man’s
face.
just
a
simple
justice
would
compel
that.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
perhaps,
mr.
aurnou
may
have
expressed
himself
somewhat
more
enthusiastically
than
what
was
his
intention.
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
make
such
a
presumption
because
when
you
read
the
record,
and
when
you
see
what
it
was
that
was
sought
to
be
brought
into
context
here,
it
was
not
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
as
to
voluntariness
alone.
the
only
point
that
was
thought
to
be
brought
in
the
context
was
whether
it
was
admissible
in
terms
of
miranda,
a
question
on
which
all
of
us
agree.
there
was
never
any
doubt
about
that.
we
had
come
to
that
conclusion
months
and
months
and
months
before
this
trial.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
would
have
to
get
these
minutes
to
refresh
my
recollection
before
i
could
give
you
an
absolutely
definitive
answer
mr.
chief
justice.
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
a
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
whether
--
there
was
a
hearing
requested
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
whether
or
not
this,
that
this
was
admissible.
and
we
all
knew
it
wasn’t.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
oh!
no,
your
honor,
it
won’t
--
yes.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
can’t
be
entirely
honest
and
give
you
the
answer
that
i
would
choose
to
give
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
this
was
offered
an
evidence
but
simply
to
prefer
it’s
identity
for
the
appellate
court.
it
was
never
passed
to
the
jury.
it
was
never
read
in
its
totality
in
the
jury.
and
the
only
reference
to
the
confession
was
made
in
the
by-play
between
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
the
defendant
during
his
cross-examination.
although
technically,
i
must
concede
that
it
was
admitted
into
evidence.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
only
for
the
purpose
of
identifying,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
if
we
go
beyond
this
area,
in
oklahoma,
old
back
in
--
about
1898
up
to
that
point,
the
great
many
jurisdictions
as
i’ve
said
went
along
with
the
proposition
that
even
in
inadmissible
statement
would
be
proper
impeachment
--
for
a
proper
impeachment
purpose.
but
the
eighth
circuit
in
oklahoma
at
that
time,
i
got
this
citation.
harold
against
oklahoma
said,
“no,
we
got
to
come
to
a
point
of
division
here,
and
that
point
of
division
has
to
be
whether
or
not
this
statement
was
voluntary,
because
an
involuntary
statement
carries
with
it
the
stigma
of
untruth.”
and
at
that
point
that
the
division
came
and
then
from
thereon
a
great
many
jurisdictions,
all
whom
i’ve
listed,
continued
to
cleave
to
that
role.
a
statement
even
though
inadmissible
was
the
proper
source
of
cross-examination
for
impeachment
if
it
was
demonstrated
to
be
voluntary.
and
that
condition
existed
right
up
until
1966
when
this
court
decided
miranda
against
arizona.
and
at
that
point,
the
court
indicated
that
even
in
an
inculpatory
statement,
if
it
sought
to
be
used
by
the
prosecution
becomes
just
for
the
very
purpose
that
he
chooses
to
offer
it
to
a
certain
extent
inculpatory.
and
the
court
said
that
even
in
an
exculpatory
statement,
the
miranda
warnings
would
have
to
be
taken.
and
a
great
many
courts
from
the
language
of
the
court
in
that
miranda
case
came
to
the
conclusion
that
even
for
impeachment
purposes,
simple
voluntariness
wasn’t
enough.
and
that
was
the
source
of
what
we
think
is
the
misunderstanding
that
has
been
created
by
the
diversion
among
this
courts
because
as
mr.
aurnou
points
out,
he’s
got
16
jurisdictions
on
his
side
and
as
i
point
out,
i
got
eight
jurisdictions
on
mine.
now
that’s
the
way
you
win
baseball
games.
it
isn’t
the
way
you
win
important
determinations
of
law
because
any
of
my
eight
could
be
as
right
as
any
of
his
16.
the
point
that
we
would
make
is
this,
in
miranda
against
arizona,
the
court
directed
itself
to
the
admissibility
of
confessions.
it
started
in
the
first
paragraph
and
i
can’t
quite
quote
the
language,
we
address
ourselves
to
be
admissibility
of
confessions.
but
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
in
the
ordinary
effective
sense,
this
confession
of
confession
can
be
called.
it
was
not
introduced
into
evidence.
and
so
as
a
consequence,
it
can
reasonably
be
concluded
i
think
that
miranda
did
not
addressed
itself
to
confession.
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
--
was
to
not
introduce
into
evidence.
now
the
point
that
is
important
is
if
you
got
an
exculpatory
statement
that
was
taken
with
the
full
miranda
warnings,
you
can
introduce
that
into
evidence.
now
suppose
he
gave
another
exculpatory
statement
with
the
full
miranda
warnings
to
another
law
enforcement
officer
that
would
be
equally
admissible.
and
thus
perhaps,
you
might
be
able
to
impeach
his
credibility
or
his
reliability
or
what
have
you
before
he
ever
got
on
the
stand
by
the
purpose
of
introducing
two
inconsistent
statements
that
were
taken
under
the
authority
and
with
the
full
approval
of
miranda.
and
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
is
the
thing
that
the
court
sought
to
prevent,
the
introduction
into
evidence
on
the
people’s
direct
case
of
these
inconsistencies.
and
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
think
i
said
all
i
have
to
say.
thank
you.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
i
think
i
can
perhaps
be
of
more
service
to
the
court
by
beginning
rather
than
what
a
formal
argument
by
answering
some
of
the
questions
that
the
justices
have
had
asked
and
perhaps
haven’t
been
answered
to
my
full
satisfaction.

from
that
position
as
defendant
and
become
a
witness,
he
then
becomes
as
vulnerable
and
the
subject
to
impeachment
as
any
other
witness.
and
this
was
accepted
and
it
was
accepted
in
a
great
many
jurisdictions
even
to
the
point
of
their
saying
that
even
if
we
adopt
as
a
principle,
the
possibility
that
this
man
may
be
impeached
by
inadmissible
evidence,
he
invites
that
by
taking
a
stand.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
if
this
had
been
a
coerced
confession,
it’s
that
people’s
view
and
the
respondent’s
view
that
it
couldn’t
have
been
used
for
any
purpose,
because
the
entire
thrust
or
the
only
thing
we
can
tell
to
this
court
is
that
because
if
it
is
a
voluntary
confession,
its
truth
is
greatly
to
be
relied
upon.
now,
if
you
conceive
of
a
situation
where
we
can
even
rely
on
the
truth
of
this
thing,
then
we
can’t
use
it
to
impeach
him.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don’t
think
we
could
for
this
reason.
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
make
is
a
voluntary
confession,
if
it’s
voluntary
in
traditional
sense,
can
be
relied
upon
to
express
the
truth
or
as
an
involuntary
confession
is
subject
to
take
the
obvious
example.
a
man
will
say
anything
to
keep
from
being
beaten
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
go
to
some
of
the
countries
behind
the
iron
curtain
to
demonstrate
that.
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
human
endurance
can’t
continue.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart
because
the
thought
is
that
we
must
have
to
find
a
class
of
confessions
which
may
be
used
for
these
purposes.
and
i
think
once
you
define
a
class
as
being
a
true
confession
rather
than
a
voluntary
confession,
then
you’re
getting
into
extraneous
matters
that
perhaps
aren’t
properly
explored
in
such
a
context
as
this.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
as
being
involuntary,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
you
mean,
as
i
would
choose
to
use
it
without
a
pretrial?
mr.
james
j.
duggan
oh!
by
all
means
mr.
justice
marshall!
we
would
--
mr.
james
j.
duggan
oh!
by
all
means,
there
would
have
to
be
some
judicial
determination
of
that
prior
to
any
concept
of
throwing
in
this
in
this
man’s
face.
just
a
simple
justice
would
compel
that.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
perhaps,
mr.
aurnou
may
have
expressed
himself
somewhat
more
enthusiastically
than
what
was
his
intention.
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
make
such
a
presumption
because
when
you
read
the
record,
and
when
you
see
what
it
was
that
was
sought
to
be
brought
into
context
here,
it
was
not
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
as
to
voluntariness
alone.
the
only
point
that
was
thought
to
be
brought
in
the
context
was
whether
it
was
admissible
in
terms
of
miranda,
a
question
on
which
all
of
us
agree.
there
was
never
any
doubt
about
that.
we
had
come
to
that
conclusion
months
and
months
and
months
before
this
trial.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
would
have
to
get
these
minutes
to
refresh
my
recollection
before
i
could
give
you
an
absolutely
definitive
answer
mr.
chief
justice.
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
a
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
whether
--
there
was
a
hearing
requested
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
whether
or
not
this,
that
this
was
admissible.
and
we
all
knew
it
wasn’t.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
oh!
no,
your
honor,
it
won’t
--
yes.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
i
can’t
be
entirely
honest
and
give
you
the
answer
that
i
would
choose
to
give
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
this
was
offered
an
evidence
but
simply
to
prefer
it’s
identity
for
the
appellate
court.
it
was
never
passed
to
the
jury.
it
was
never
read
in
its
totality
in
the
jury.
and
the
only
reference
to
the
confession
was
made
in
the
by-play
between
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
the
defendant
during
his
cross-examination.
although
technically,
i
must
concede
that
it
was
admitted
into
evidence.
mr.
james
j.
duggan
only
for
the
purpose
of
identifying,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
if
we
go
beyond
this
area,
in
oklahoma,
old
back
in
--
about
1898
up
to
that
point,
the
great
many
jurisdictions
as
i’ve
said
went
along
with
the
proposition
that
even
in
inadmissible
statement
would
be
proper
impeachment
--
for
a
proper
impeachment
purpose.
but
the
eighth
circuit
in
oklahoma
at
that
time,
i
got
this
citation.
harold
against
oklahoma
said,
“no,
we
got
to
come
to
a
point
of
division
here,
and
that
point
of
division
has
to
be
whether
or
not
this
statement
was
voluntary,
because
an
involuntary
statement
carries
with
it
the
stigma
of
untruth.”
and
at
that
point
that
the
division
came
and
then
from
thereon
a
great
many
jurisdictions,
all
whom
i’ve
listed,
continued
to
cleave
to
that
role.
a
statement
even
though
inadmissible
was
the
proper
source
of
cross-examination
for
impeachment
if
it
was
demonstrated
to
be
voluntary.
and
that
condition
existed
right
up
until
1966
when
this
court
decided
miranda
against
arizona.
and
at
that
point,
the
court
indicated
that
even
in
an
inculpatory
statement,
if
it
sought
to
be
used
by
the
prosecution
becomes
just
for
the
very
purpose
that
he
chooses
to
offer
it
to
a
certain
extent
inculpatory.
and
the
court
said
that
even
in
an
exculpatory
statement,
the
miranda
warnings
would
have
to
be
taken.
and
a
great
many
courts
from
the
language
of
the
court
in
that
miranda
case
came
to
the
conclusion
that
even
for
impeachment
purposes,
simple
voluntariness
wasn’t
enough.
and
that
was
the
source
of
what
we
think
is
the
misunderstanding
that
has
been
created
by
the
diversion
among
this
courts
because
as
mr.
aurnou
points
out,
he’s
got
16
jurisdictions
on
his
side
and
as
i
point
out,
i
got
eight
jurisdictions
on
mine.
now
that’s
the
way
you
win
baseball
games.
it
isn’t
the
way
you
win
important
determinations
of
law
because
any
of
my
eight
could
be
as
right
as
any
of
his
16.
the
point
that
we
would
make
is
this,
in
miranda
against
arizona,
the
court
directed
itself
to
the
admissibility
of
confessions.
it
started
in
the
first
paragraph
and
i
can’t
quite
quote
the
language,
we
address
ourselves
to
be
admissibility
of
confessions.
but
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
in
the
ordinary
effective
sense,
this
confession
of
confession
can
be
called.
it
was
not
introduced
into
evidence.
and
so
as
a
consequence,
it
can
reasonably
be
concluded
i
think
that
miranda
did
not
addressed
itself
to
confession.
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
--
was
to
not
introduce
into
evidence.
now
the
point
that
is
important
is
if
you
got
an
exculpatory
statement
that
was
taken
with
the
full
miranda
warnings,
you
can
introduce
that
into
evidence.
now
suppose
he
gave
another
exculpatory
statement
with
the
full
miranda
warnings
to
another
law
enforcement
officer
that
would
be
equally
admissible.
and
thus
perhaps,
you
might
be
able
to
impeach
his
credibility
or
his
reliability
or
what
have
you
before
he
ever
got
on
the
stand
by
the
purpose
of
introducing
two
inconsistent
statements
that
were
taken
under
the
authority
and
with
the
full
approval
of
miranda.
and
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
is
the
thing
that
the
court
sought
to
prevent,
the
introduction
into
evidence
on
the
people’s
direct
case
of
these
inconsistencies.
and
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
think
i
said
all
i
have
to
say.
thank
you.
