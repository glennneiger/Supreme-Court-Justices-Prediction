mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
i
could
finish
in
that
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
the
interest
of
the
state
of
connecticut
in
this
case
is
identical
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
government,
we
subscribe
to
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
government
in
its
briefs
and
in
oral
argument
here
this
morning.
in
addition,
i
should
like
to
point
out
one
or
two
aspects
of
the
case,
very
briefly,
which
we
think
the
court
should
consider
carefully.
now,
while
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
stated
that
they
brought
this
action,
they
could've
brought
this
action
in
any
state
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
remains
that
they
brought
the
action
against
four
colleges
in
the
state
of
connecticut
and
named
the
state
of
connecticut
as
a
defendant
in
the
case.
while
we
have
not
officially
sought
to
represent
all
of
the
states
in
this
matter,
we
feel
that
by
being
named
the
defendant
in
the
case,
we
have
been
cast
in
the
role
of
representative
without
portfolio
for
all
of
the
states
in
this
area.
incidentally,
this
role
seems
quite
appropriate
in
this
place
because
connecticut
is
known
as
the
constitution
state.
i
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
each
of
the
states
in
the
united
states
are
participating
in
this
grant
program
and
are
vitally
interested
in
seeing
that
federal
funds
continue
to
flow
under
this
act
to
the
states
to
enlarge
and
expand
educational
facilities
in
order
to
accommodate
the
rapidly
growing
numbers
of
young
people
aspiring
to
higher
education.
i
should
also
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that,
in
view
of
the
state
of
the
congressional
record,
when
this
act
was
being
considered,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
seriously
contended
by
appellants
that
congress
intended
to
violate
the
establishment
clause
of
the
constitution
by
providing
federal
funds
to
religion.
the
congressional
purpose
clearly
stated,
in
debate
and
in
section
701
of
the
act,
was
to
meet
an
educational
crisis
by
providing
funds
for
academic
facilities
to
further
the
educational
development
of
its
citizenry
which
would
be
beneficial
to
the
whole
nation.
we
submit
it
was
to
implement
that
national
purpose
that
the
act
was
adopted,
and
it
was
to
advance
that
purpose
that
the
states
have
participated
in
the
grant
program.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
congress
evidently
anticipated
the
recent
holding
of
this
case
--
court
in
the
walz
decision
to
the
effect
that
excessive
entanglement
by
the
government
in
administration
of
religion
might
make
the
legislation
declare
it
unconstitutional.
under
the
act
under
consideration
here,
each
state
was
required
to
establish
an
agency
for
the
purpose
of
screening
grant
applications
and
establishing
priorities
among
projects
within
the
state.
however,
the
states
were
given
no
authority
to
adopt
supplemental
guidelines
with
respect
to
hiring
practices
or
for
inspection
procedures
subsequent
to
construction.
the
state's
responsibility
and
authority
terminated
when
the
application
was
approved
and
submitted
to
the
us
commissioner
of
education.
in
like
manner,
the
congress
provided
in
section
757
of
the
act
that
the
united
states
government
could
not
become
involved
in
“the
personnel,
curriculum,
methods
of
instruction,
or
administration
of
the
colleges
which
received
grants.”
the
sole
responsibility
and
authority
of
the
government,
after
completion
of
construction,
was
to
determine
for
a
period
of
20
years
by
on-site
inspection
whether
the
facility
was
being
used
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
constructed,
that
is,
education
rather
than
being
used
for
religious
purposes.
accordingly,
i
submit
that
congress
could
not
have
done
more
to
avoid
entanglement
with
religion
by
the
federal
government
of
the
states.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don't
recall
exactly
how
much
was
received
by
all
of
the
church-related
institutions
in
connecticut,
but
it's
only
a
portion
of
the
building
cost
for
each
project,
justice
harlan.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don't
have
the
dollar
figure.
i
believe
mr.
williams
will
have
that
for
the
court
tomorrow.
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
like
to
state
that
counsel
for
the
appellants
here
this
afternoon
has
made
an
issue,
and
quite
a
significant
issue,
of
the
fact
that
he
has
labeled
the
four
colleges
in
this
case
sectarian,
whereas,
the
appellees
refer
to
them
as
church-related,
and
he
indicated
that
he
was
consistent
throughout
the
case
in
labeling
them
and
calling
them
sectarian.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
99
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
stipulation
entered
into
between
counsel
for
the
appellants
and
the
state
of
connecticut
is
set
forth,
and
further
direct
the
court's
attention
to
paragraph
16
in
which
we
considered
and
used
and
agreed
upon
the
following
language.
“the
commission
and
members
thereof
have
had
occasion
to
consider
questions
raised
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
grants
to
church-related
institutions
on
at
least
several
occasions.”
so,
i
submit
that
counsel
for
the
appellants,
on
occasion,
has
used
the
term
church-related
in
referring
to
these
institutions.
thank
you.
