justice
william
o.
douglas
when
you
say
we
hadn't
persistently
done
anything--[attempt
to
laughter]
we
only
talked
about
two
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
everson,
in
walz,
what
else?
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
we
had
yesterday
i
think
from
mr.
friedman
that
there’s
something
in
the
way
of
policing
of
what
goes
on
in
these
buildings.
do
you
see
any
problems
connected
to
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
actual
policing
and
what
form
it
took?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
there
any
evidence
that
in
fact
any
policing
have
been
done
and
if
any,
what
form?
justice
william
o.
douglas
let
me
say
mr.
williams,
there's
no
religious
instruction
at
all
at
any
of
them?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean
of
the
four
--
we
have
four,
don’t
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
there
is
religious
instruction
of
each?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
those
--
is
attendance
as
part
of
the
curriculum
for
degree
required
the
attendance
on
those
courses?
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
the
district
court
as
i
read
its
opinion
didn’t
get
into
these
facts
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
district
court
--
i
understand
that
the
attack
is
upon
the
standards
applied
by
district
court
in
determining
whether
there
is
establishment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
talking
about
its
opinion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
wouldn’t
have
to
perhaps
if
a
standard
is
correct.
it
says
on
page
51,
“we
hold
that
the
act
has
a
primary
effect
that
neither
advances
nor
inhibits
religion.”
now
that’s
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
has
a
secondary
effect,
is
that
the
right
test
what
i
imagine?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
you
stop
right
there
a
moment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
to
the
extent
that
there
is
policing
of
what
goes
on
and
this
funded
–
federally-funded
building.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
see
any
hazard
of
inhibition,
inhibiting
religion?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
as
i
gather
policing
would
mean
stepping
in
and
a
lot
of
interrogation
by
government
officials
as
to
whether
or
not
this
course
to
that
course
has
a
religious
content?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
then,
under
your
argument
then
the
clergyman
could
be
put
on
the
federal
payroll
provided
he
was
teaching
physics
or
math
or
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand,
i'm
just
wondering
how
far
this
theory
of
yours
goes
because
we
have
other
cases
like
that
coming.
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
that
--
it
wasn’t
an
education
institution?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
you
agreed
that
the
federal
government
or
--
neither
the
federal
government
nor
state
could
have
created
these
institutions
launched
them
and
charted
and
finance
them?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
their
entirety?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
way
they
were,
we’re
talking
about
today
starting
at
yale
today
is
i
suppose
that
could
be
a
federal
institution
without
any
problem.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
suppose
if
you
put
the
clergyman
on
the
payroll
and
he’s
teaching
physics
that
takes
him
off
the
budget
of
the
school
for
the
performance
of
other
things
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
anybody
has
ever
doubt
to
that,
at
least
on
this
board.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
williams
that,
take
your
$4
million
building
suppose
it
had
two
wings.
the
government’s
contribution
is
a
half
million
dollars
one
wing
is
the
science
laboratory;
the
other
wing
is
a
church.
would
that
qualify?
