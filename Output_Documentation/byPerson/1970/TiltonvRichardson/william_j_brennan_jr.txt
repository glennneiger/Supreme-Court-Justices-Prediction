but
wasn't
that
critical,
meaningful,
and
major
part
of
its
existence
so
that
total
education
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
church-related
roman
catholic
parochial
schools,
or
lutheran,
or
jewish,
i
gather,
both
reformed
and
orthodox,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
church-related
parochial
schools.
how
many
different
faiths?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
how
many
parochial
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
under
your
definition,
all
four
of
them
would
be
sectarian?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
has
any
one
of
those
four,
can
it
be
said
that
propagation,
teaching,
or
practice
or
religion
is
not
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
the
existence
of
the
parochial
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
can
be
or
cannot
be
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
using--
i'm
trying
to
get
at
this
through
your
definition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
to
any
of
the
four
that
you've
named,
jewish,
roman
catholic,
lutheran,
and
what
was
the
fourth,
the
seventh
day
adventist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that
that
some
particular,
let's
say,
college
identified
with,
perhaps,
the
roman
catholic
order
may,
in
its
particular
circumstances,
not
be
sectarian
under
your
definition.
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
roman
catholic
elementary
schools
that
would
not
be
sectarian
under
your
definition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
lutheran
elementary
schools
that
that
would
be
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not--
i'm
trying
to
limit
it
to
your
four
for
the
moment.
can
you
think
of
any
jewish
as
to
which--
elementary
schools
as
to
which
that
would
be
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
seventh
day
adventist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
finish
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
any
elementary
schools
of
the
seventh
day
adventist
faith?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
some
baptist
parochial
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
baptist.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
methodists?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hence
then,
did
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
adopt
your
definition
of
sectarian
in
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pfeffer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sometime,
would
you
comment
on
the
bradfield
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
fact
it
is
not
cited
in
the
government's
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
have
made
any
difference
in
bradfield
if,
as
i
think
is
the
custom
in
catholic
hospitals,
there
were
a
crucifix
on
each--
the
wall
of
each
hospital
room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
that
each
nurse
was
a
nun
wearing
a--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
that
the
director
of
the
hospital--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
i
suppose
the
government
could
give
the
money
to
the
church
to
carry
on
the
non-religious
activity
even
though
the
church
might
have
carried
it
on
any
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
would
just
say
it's
church
money.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bookkeeping
really
isn't
important.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
you
certainly
have
to
concede
that
what
happened
in
that
case
was
a
subsidy
of
a
religious
order
to
operate
the
hospital,
wasn't
it?
it
was
government
subsidy
with
government
money
to
operate
activity
of
the
religious
order
toward
the
hospitals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
it
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
a
subsidy,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
matter
how
you
parse
it,
it
was
nevertheless
the
subsidy
of
a
religious
institution,
wasn't
it,
to
that
extent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
forbidding
the
subsidy--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
catholic
church?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
the
catholic
church?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you're
saying
that
you
may
not
subsidize
an
activity
which
is
a
religious
activity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
teaching
of
mathematics
in
a
building
is
a
religious
activity
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
a
very
short
point.
we've
only
reached
the
point
whether--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
government
can
subsidize
the
construction
of
a
building.
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
be
taught
in
it,
but--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
why
should
it
subsidize
the
operation
of
a
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
government
could've
come
into
the
business
of
building
hospitals
of
its
own.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
the
government
would
be
barred
by
the
first
amendment
from
building
a
sectarian
school.
i
supo--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
making
an
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
making
an
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
the
case
we
have,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
this
connecticut
case--
was
that
decided
before
we
decided
walz?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
from
your
brief,
you're
suggesting
that
we
may
have
a
different
test
in
walz
than
the
one
we
have--
than
the
purpose
and
effect
test
we
had
in
schempp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
all
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
read
some
judicial
opinions
attempting
to
draw
a
distinction
between
an
exemption
and
a
subsidy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
end
of
20
years,
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
it
can
be
converted
for
the
church,
can't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
government
paid
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
that
form
of
surveillance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
for
20
years,
you're
telling
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
form
does
it
take?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
an
expressed
statutory
provision
which
says
you
shall
keep
this
surveillance
over
20
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
the
procedures
for
surveillance
set
up
by
regulation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe
i
should
answer--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
was
asking
you
whether
they
were
required
by
law
to
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
the
surveillance
is
un-consequent
and
it
makes--
adds
to
the
unconstitutionality.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
facility,
you
mean
the
institution,
not
the
particular--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
particular
laboratory
building,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
thought
what
we
were
dealing
with
here
was
the
construction
of
a
building
which
was
to
be
used
as
a
laboratory,
or
something,
for
chemistry
and
the
like
that
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
any
religious
teaching,
and
you
say
that
that's
prohibited.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
recently,
you
may
know
it,
mr.
pfeffer.
it
has
opened,
on
the
campus
of
a
catholic
university,
a
theater.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
father
hartke's.
he's
a
director.
he's
a
priest.
that's
open
to
the
public
of
course,
but
with
that
--
if
the
government
had
built
the
father
hartke's
theater,
would
--
since
it's
on
the
campus
of
catholic
university,
he's
on
the
faculty
of
the
catholic
university.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
in
some--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
let's
take
these
specific
institutions
here
that
the
government
include
students
who
want
to
go
to
these
schools
in
a
generally
applicable
scholarship
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
--
it's
a
scholarship
program
based
on
financial
need,
but
if
--
but
he
can
take
his
scholarship
and
go
anywhere
he
wants
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
certainly
deny
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
in
that
situation,
the
government
would
be
furnishing
the
most
critical
element
of
a
religious
activity,
namely
the
people.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
read
allen
as
--
in
part
as
being--
going
on
the
ground
that
it
went
to
the
students
instead
of
the
institution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
would
i
find
that
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
the
same
as
saying
it
went
to
the
students
instead
of
a
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
might
have
been
different
if
the
youngster
got
money
to
go
to
a
bookstore
and
buy
the
books?
do
you
think
allen
would've
come
out
differently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
once
a
grant
is
made
though,
mr.
friedman,
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pfeffer
suggested
that
once
a
grant
is
made,
once
you
get
over
these
hurdles
and
the
institution
qualifies
for
a
particular
facility,
then
is
the
right
policing
arrangement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
statutory
provision
that
deals
with
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
under
some
standard
procedures,
regulations,
or--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
regional
setups
throughout
the
country.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
i--
did
i
read
in
one
of
the
briefs?
there's
so
many
briefs
here.
i
can't
be
sure.
that
there
had
been
an
incident
about
some
institution
in
mississippi,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
it
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
20
years,
i
think
mr.
pfeffer
suggested,
then
the
fee
goes
over--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather,
at
that
time,
the
assembly
hall
could
be
converted
into
a
chapel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
court
made
no
findings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
its
implication
was
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
must
consider
this
case
as
though
it
were
a
case
involving
an
institution
that
did
limit
admission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
--
excuse
me,
does
it
--
what
does
the
record
show
about
whether
or
not
people
who
attend
these
institutions
must
attend
chapel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
catholics?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
ones
that
where
they
require
some
of
the
students,
namely
catholics,
to
--
as
a
condition
for
participating
in
the
secular
education
program
to
attend
chapel
and
to
take
a
course
in
religion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
that
is
independent
of
any
--
without
the
compulsion
of
any
school
regulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
a
matter
of
faith.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
a
school
that
does
require,
mr.
friedman,
and
some
schools
do,
west
point
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
grants
to
non-religiously
affiliated
schools,
had
they
exceeded
an
amount
the
grants
to
religiously
affiliated
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
the
commitment,
which
you
mentioned
earlier,
not
to
use,
to
teach
religion
and
so
forth,
is
that
limited
to
a
commitment
by
the
religiously
affiliated
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
has
to
make
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
there
was
consideration
of
whether
building
more
colleges,
more
universities
was
or
was
not
an
alternative
--
a
more
acceptable
alternative
than
using
religiously
affiliated
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
rather
better
to
expand
their
facilities
than
to
build
new
ones?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
saying
really
that
there's
only
one
test
that
we've
persistently
applied
and
that's
the
purpose
and
effect
test.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
facts
mr.
williams?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
these
buildings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
my
question
is
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
keep
you
where
they
make.
in
these
buildings,
may
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
history?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
they
permit
it,
mr.
williams?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
question
mr.
pfeffer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
your
argument
runs
in
anyway
to
a
free
exercise
problem?
suppose
in
the
religious
organization
cut
out
of
the
stand
so
you
can
see
the
power
of
federal
government
to
subsidize
and
operate
schools,
cut
out
the
religious
grants.
do
you
think
it’s
a
kind
of
a
free
exercise
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
wasn't
that
critical,
meaningful,
and
major
part
of
its
existence
so
that
total
education
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
church-related
roman
catholic
parochial
schools,
or
lutheran,
or
jewish,
i
gather,
both
reformed
and
orthodox,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
church-related
parochial
schools.
how
many
different
faiths?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
how
many
parochial
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
under
your
definition,
all
four
of
them
would
be
sectarian?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
has
any
one
of
those
four,
can
it
be
said
that
propagation,
teaching,
or
practice
or
religion
is
not
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
the
existence
of
the
parochial
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
can
be
or
cannot
be
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
using--
i'm
trying
to
get
at
this
through
your
definition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
to
any
of
the
four
that
you've
named,
jewish,
roman
catholic,
lutheran,
and
what
was
the
fourth,
the
seventh
day
adventist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that
that
some
particular,
let's
say,
college
identified
with,
perhaps,
the
roman
catholic
order
may,
in
its
particular
circumstances,
not
be
sectarian
under
your
definition.
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
roman
catholic
elementary
schools
that
would
not
be
sectarian
under
your
definition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
lutheran
elementary
schools
that
that
would
be
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not--
i'm
trying
to
limit
it
to
your
four
for
the
moment.
can
you
think
of
any
jewish
as
to
which--
elementary
schools
as
to
which
that
would
be
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
seventh
day
adventist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
finish
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
any
elementary
schools
of
the
seventh
day
adventist
faith?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
some
baptist
parochial
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
baptist.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
methodists?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hence
then,
did
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
adopt
your
definition
of
sectarian
in
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pfeffer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sometime,
would
you
comment
on
the
bradfield
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
fact
it
is
not
cited
in
the
government's
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
have
made
any
difference
in
bradfield
if,
as
i
think
is
the
custom
in
catholic
hospitals,
there
were
a
crucifix
on
each--
the
wall
of
each
hospital
room?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
that
each
nurse
was
a
nun
wearing
a--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
that
the
director
of
the
hospital--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
i
suppose
the
government
could
give
the
money
to
the
church
to
carry
on
the
non-religious
activity
even
though
the
church
might
have
carried
it
on
any
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
would
just
say
it's
church
money.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bookkeeping
really
isn't
important.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
you
certainly
have
to
concede
that
what
happened
in
that
case
was
a
subsidy
of
a
religious
order
to
operate
the
hospital,
wasn't
it?
it
was
government
subsidy
with
government
money
to
operate
activity
of
the
religious
order
toward
the
hospitals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
it
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
a
subsidy,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
matter
how
you
parse
it,
it
was
nevertheless
the
subsidy
of
a
religious
institution,
wasn't
it,
to
that
extent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
forbidding
the
subsidy--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
catholic
church?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
the
catholic
church?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you're
saying
that
you
may
not
subsidize
an
activity
which
is
a
religious
activity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
teaching
of
mathematics
in
a
building
is
a
religious
activity
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
a
very
short
point.
we've
only
reached
the
point
whether--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
government
can
subsidize
the
construction
of
a
building.
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
be
taught
in
it,
but--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
why
should
it
subsidize
the
operation
of
a
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
government
could've
come
into
the
business
of
building
hospitals
of
its
own.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
the
government
would
be
barred
by
the
first
amendment
from
building
a
sectarian
school.
i
supo--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
making
an
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
making
an
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
the
case
we
have,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
this
connecticut
case--
was
that
decided
before
we
decided
walz?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
from
your
brief,
you're
suggesting
that
we
may
have
a
different
test
in
walz
than
the
one
we
have--
than
the
purpose
and
effect
test
we
had
in
schempp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
all
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
read
some
judicial
opinions
attempting
to
draw
a
distinction
between
an
exemption
and
a
subsidy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
end
of
20
years,
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
it
can
be
converted
for
the
church,
can't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
government
paid
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
that
form
of
surveillance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
for
20
years,
you're
telling
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
form
does
it
take?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
an
expressed
statutory
provision
which
says
you
shall
keep
this
surveillance
over
20
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
the
procedures
for
surveillance
set
up
by
regulation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe
i
should
answer--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
was
asking
you
whether
they
were
required
by
law
to
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
the
surveillance
is
un-consequent
and
it
makes--
adds
to
the
unconstitutionality.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
facility,
you
mean
the
institution,
not
the
particular--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
particular
laboratory
building,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
thought
what
we
were
dealing
with
here
was
the
construction
of
a
building
which
was
to
be
used
as
a
laboratory,
or
something,
for
chemistry
and
the
like
that
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
any
religious
teaching,
and
you
say
that
that's
prohibited.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
recently,
you
may
know
it,
mr.
pfeffer.
it
has
opened,
on
the
campus
of
a
catholic
university,
a
theater.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
father
hartke's.
he's
a
director.
he's
a
priest.
that's
open
to
the
public
of
course,
but
with
that
--
if
the
government
had
built
the
father
hartke's
theater,
would
--
since
it's
on
the
campus
of
catholic
university,
he's
on
the
faculty
of
the
catholic
university.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
in
some--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
let's
take
these
specific
institutions
here
that
the
government
include
students
who
want
to
go
to
these
schools
in
a
generally
applicable
scholarship
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
--
it's
a
scholarship
program
based
on
financial
need,
but
if
--
but
he
can
take
his
scholarship
and
go
anywhere
he
wants
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
certainly
deny
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
in
that
situation,
the
government
would
be
furnishing
the
most
critical
element
of
a
religious
activity,
namely
the
people.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
read
allen
as
--
in
part
as
being--
going
on
the
ground
that
it
went
to
the
students
instead
of
the
institution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
would
i
find
that
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
the
same
as
saying
it
went
to
the
students
instead
of
a
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
might
have
been
different
if
the
youngster
got
money
to
go
to
a
bookstore
and
buy
the
books?
do
you
think
allen
would've
come
out
differently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
once
a
grant
is
made
though,
mr.
friedman,
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pfeffer
suggested
that
once
a
grant
is
made,
once
you
get
over
these
hurdles
and
the
institution
qualifies
for
a
particular
facility,
then
is
the
right
policing
arrangement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
statutory
provision
that
deals
with
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
under
some
standard
procedures,
regulations,
or--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
regional
setups
throughout
the
country.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
i--
did
i
read
in
one
of
the
briefs?
there's
so
many
briefs
here.
i
can't
be
sure.
that
there
had
been
an
incident
about
some
institution
in
mississippi,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
it
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
20
years,
i
think
mr.
pfeffer
suggested,
then
the
fee
goes
over--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather,
at
that
time,
the
assembly
hall
could
be
converted
into
a
chapel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
court
made
no
findings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
its
implication
was
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
must
consider
this
case
as
though
it
were
a
case
involving
an
institution
that
did
limit
admission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
--
excuse
me,
does
it
--
what
does
the
record
show
about
whether
or
not
people
who
attend
these
institutions
must
attend
chapel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
catholics?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
ones
that
where
they
require
some
of
the
students,
namely
catholics,
to
--
as
a
condition
for
participating
in
the
secular
education
program
to
attend
chapel
and
to
take
a
course
in
religion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
that
is
independent
of
any
--
without
the
compulsion
of
any
school
regulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
a
matter
of
faith.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
a
school
that
does
require,
mr.
friedman,
and
some
schools
do,
west
point
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
grants
to
non-religiously
affiliated
schools,
had
they
exceeded
an
amount
the
grants
to
religiously
affiliated
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
the
commitment,
which
you
mentioned
earlier,
not
to
use,
to
teach
religion
and
so
forth,
is
that
limited
to
a
commitment
by
the
religiously
affiliated
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
has
to
make
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
there
was
consideration
of
whether
building
more
colleges,
more
universities
was
or
was
not
an
alternative
--
a
more
acceptable
alternative
than
using
religiously
affiliated
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
rather
better
to
expand
their
facilities
than
to
build
new
ones?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
saying
really
that
there's
only
one
test
that
we've
persistently
applied
and
that's
the
purpose
and
effect
test.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
facts
mr.
williams?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
these
buildings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
my
question
is
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
keep
you
where
they
make.
in
these
buildings,
may
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
history?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
they
permit
it,
mr.
williams?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
question
mr.
pfeffer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
your
argument
runs
in
anyway
to
a
free
exercise
problem?
suppose
in
the
religious
organization
cut
out
of
the
stand
so
you
can
see
the
power
of
federal
government
to
subsidize
and
operate
schools,
cut
out
the
religious
grants.
do
you
think
it’s
a
kind
of
a
free
exercise
problem?
