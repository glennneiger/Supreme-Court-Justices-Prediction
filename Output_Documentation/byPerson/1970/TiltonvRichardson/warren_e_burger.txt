chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
153,
tilton
and
others
against
richardson.
mr.
pfeffer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
comment
to
you,
as
we
indicated
before
we
opened
this
morning,
mr.
justice
marshall
is
unavoidably
absent
due
to
an
illness
and
he
will
make
his
own
decision
as
to
the
participation
and
if
he
does
then
participate,
it
will
be
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
usual
papers
and
on
the
tape
recording
of
the
argument,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
that's
entirely
agreeable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
a
building,
really,
from
the
transportation
facility
as
a
tool
of
education?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pfeffer,
suppose,
against
the
background
that
we
have
in
this
country
of
shortage
of
doctors
and
probably
a
shortage
of
lawyers,
the
government
embarked
on
the
grant
program
to
grant
to
any
school,
any
university
including
georgetown
and
catholic
university,
grants
for
law
schools
and
basic
science
and
medical
schools
which
we
build
on
the
land
owned
by
the
university
and
to
revert
to
them
as
it
does
here
in
fee
after
20
years.
would
you
--
i'm
not
clear
from
what
you've
said
now
whether
that
would
or
would
not
be
permissible
constitutionally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
have
included
in
my
hypothesis
what
i
believe
to
be
the
fact
that
georgetown
university
you
can
go
to
the
law
school
without
going
to
any
other
school,
going
to--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
pfeffer.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
somewhere
along
the
line,
tell
me
whether
there's
any
implication
in
the
fact
that
your
brief
did
not
cite
bradfield.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
turn,
let
me
just
ask
you
one
thing
about
the
surveillance
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
three
years
after
grant
were
made
and
the
building
built
for
chemistry
and
mathematics
and
biology,
it
suddenly
developed
that
all
those
subjects
had
been
abandoned
and
it
was
being
used
for
divinity
school.
i
suppose
the
government
would
do
something
about
that,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
maybe
an
eviction
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
if
i
may
pursue
that
fact,
carrying
it
over
to
the
everson
case,
suppose
it
developed
after
school
buses
were
provided
to
take
elementary
children
to
school,
it
was
learned
that
a
religious
teacher
was
put
on
the
bus
every
morning
so
that
they
wouldn't
lose
this
time
when
they
were
reciting
the
lord's
prayer
and
singing
religious
hymns
and
listening
to
religious
instruction.
i
suppose
that
would
be
stopped
too,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
one
in
your
mind,
under
the
everson
situation,
call
for
any
more
government
surveillance
of
the
religious
institution
than
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
as
soon
as
this
deviation
occurred,
there'd
be
a
great
many
people
calling
attention
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
friedman.
mr.
ahern,
you
have
five
minutes,
but
we'll
have
a
few
minutes
over
if
necessary
to
let
you
plead
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
ahern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

mr.

are

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
williams,
before
you
leave
that,
what
would
happen
in
response
to
justice
brennan’s
question.
would
there
be
a
violation
in
terms
--
if
they
taught
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
commitment,
mr.
williams,
a
negative
one
or
an
affirmative
one?
is
it
an
affirmative
one
in
the
sense
that
there
is
an
engagement
or
commitment
affirmatively
to
teach
chemistry
or
whatever
completely
secular
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
any
chance,
does
this
record
show
what
the
cost
is
of
some
of
the
major
medical
schools
in
the
country
funded
by
the
federal
government
such
as
harvard
medical
school?
chief
justice
