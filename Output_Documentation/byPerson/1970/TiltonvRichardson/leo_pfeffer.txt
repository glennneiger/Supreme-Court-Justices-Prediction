mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
tax
payer
suit
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
said--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
this
is
a
tax
payer
suit
challenging
both
the
interpretation
and,
secondarily,
the
constitutionality
of
title
1
of
the
higher
education
facilities
act
of
1963.
the
statute
provides
for
grounds
of
federal
funds
to
construct
what
is
called
academic
facilities
at
undergraduate
educational
institutions
at
the
post
secondary
level
and,
as
far
as
it's
relevant
to
this
case,
it
defines
academic
facilities
among
others,
as
those
which
--
to
exclude
those
used
for
sectarian
instruction
or
religious
worship
or
any
part
of
which
--
the
school
which
is
part
of
it,
the
school
or
department
of
divinity.
other
than
that,
it
does
not
contain
any
expressed
exclusion
on
predicated
part
of
the
nature
of
the
beneficiary
institution.
the
questions
as
presented
by
this
appeal,
as
we
see
it,
first,
is
not,
although
that
appears
to
be
housing
both,
all
appellees
seek
to
frame
it
is
not
whether
church-related
colleges
are
disqualified
from
participating
in
the
benefits
of
the
statute.
if
it
were,
if
that
was
the
question,
we
would
not
be
here.
we
concede
and
have
never
contended
to
the
contrary
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
college
is
church-related
does
not
either
statutorily
or
constitutionally
disqualify
it
from
receiving
federal
funds.
the
question,
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
a
sectarian
institution
is
disqualified
both
statutorily
and
constitutionally.
now,
we've
defined
in
our
complaint,
in
our
briefs
what
we
mean
by
sectarian
and,
specifically,
we
call
it
one
in
which
the
propagation,
teaching,
or
practice
of
religion
is
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
its
existence.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is--
well,
the
latest
is
in
reply
brief--
i'm
reading
from
reply
brief,
page
3.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
in
our
original
brief
as
well,
but
i'm
reading
now
from
reply
brief.
it's
in
the
original
brief
as
well.
the
propagation
in
teaching,
or
practice
of
religion
is
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
its
existence.
this
case
was
brought
before
this
court
decided
walz
against
tax
commission
of
new
york.
had
this
case
been
brought
after
that
decision,
perhaps
it
would've
defined
sectarian
in
terms
of
the
court's
decision
in
walz
as
one
whose
dominant
policy
is
to
assure
future
adherence
to
a
particular
faith
by
having
control
of
their
total
education--
by
having
the
--
to
a
particular
faith
by
having
control
of
their
total
education
at
an
early
age.
that's
in
the
walz
case.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
basically--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
they're
preferable
in
the
sense
that
it's
wiser
to
use
the
language
of
a
recent
decision
of
the
courts
than
to
use
your
own
language.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but,
basically,
i
don't
consider
any
substantial
difference
between
them.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
they're
basically
synonymous.
now--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
total
education,
as
i
understand
it,
the
total
education
involves,
now
i
think,
in
the
context,
what
it
meant
was
that
instead
of
assuring
adherence
to
faith
by
teaching
them
only
religion
and
allowing
them
to
go
to
a
secular
institution
for
secular
education,
it
says
total
education
so
that
it
has,
as
it
were,
control
of
both
the
secular
and
the
religious
aspects.
that's
how
i
interpret
total
education.
i
believe
that's
what
was
intended
within
the
context.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
how
many
are
there?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
how
many
different
faiths
have--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
for
parochial
schools
or
how
many
different
faiths
have
church-related
institutions,
which
is
completely
different--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
major
ones,
as
i
know,
the
major
ones
are
the
jewish,
the
lutheran,
the
seventh
day
adventist,
and
of
course
the
roman
catholics.
those
are
the
majors,
there
are
some
episcopalians.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
have
no
definition
which
necessarily
characterizes
an
institution
as
sectarian
or
merely
church-related
simply
on
the
basis
of
a
faith
to
which
it
bears
relationship.
there
are
many,
many
institutions
which
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
so.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
so,
if
we
use
the
term
church-related.
if
we
use
the
term
“sectarian,”
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
it's
not
a
meaningful
or
major,
then
it's
not
sectarian.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
but
there
are
some
of
those
in
which
the
relationship
to
the
church
is
so
tenuous,
it's
a
vestige
of
a
nation's
history.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
it
may
be
very
well
be
the
mere
fact
that
this
catholic
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
must
be
sectarian,
and
there
are
catholic
institutions
which--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i'm
afraid,
i
can't
think
of
any,
but--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
can't.
i
can
think
of
episcopalians.
i
can't
think
of
unitarians.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i
think
it's
quite
possible.
there
are
those--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
for
example--
let
me
give
you
an
example
why
there
are
jewish,
what
are
known
as
sole
malachim
schools
which
are
jewish
secular
schools.
they
do
not
have
a
religious
commutation.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
i'm
just
talking
about--
at
this
point,
we're
talking
about
colleges.
we're
not
talking
about
anything
else.
as
mr.
justice
brennan's--
responding
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
inquiry,
i'm
not--
parochial
schools--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
sure.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
to
my
knowledge,
all--
that
they
would
all
be
deemed
sectarian.
i
think
there
are
episcopalians
which
would
not
and,
certainly,
ethical
culture,
which
this
court
held--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
pardon
me?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
baptist?
baptists
have
very
little
parochial
schools.
they
don't
have
that.
they
don't
use
that.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
they
have
parochial
schools
either.
i
don't
think
they
have
parochial
schools.
now,
the
reason
we
have
used
the
term
“sectarian”
in
this
brief
and
in
our
procedure
because
that's
a
term
which
has
a
long
history
behind
it.
33
of
the
50
states
in
the
union
used
the
term
“sectarian,”
and
none
of
them
uses
the
term
“church-related.”
and,
indeed,
the
statute
which
is
initial
here
uses
the
word
“sectarian”
and
does
not
use
the
word
“church-related.”
now,
the
posture
of
this
controversy,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
court
below
did
not
pass
upon
the
basic
issue
which
we
presented,
we
had
a
trial
in
which
we
sought
to
present
evidence
with
respect
to
four
institutions
in
connecticut,
all
catholic,
to
show
primarily
to
present
to
create
a
record
as
to
what
might
be
deemed
sectarian
and
what
might
not
be.
we
had
precedent
for
that
in
state
court
in
maryland
just
two
or
three
years
ago.
there
were
four
institutions
which
were
challenged
under
a
similar
statute.
the
court
held
three
of
them
sectarian.
one
said
the
relationship
of
that
fourth
institution
to
a
faith,
to
religion,
was
so
tangential
that
it
could
not
be
deemed
sectarian,
but
the
court
took
the
position--
the
court--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
basically.
the
court
below
took
the
position
that
under
the
statute,
and
this
was
a
position
urged
by
the
government
and
this
is
the
position--
this
is
the
interpretation
that
the
commissioner
has
applied
throughout
the
nation,
that
it
is
completely
irrelevant
as
to
what
the
beneficiary
institution
is,
what
it
was
created
for,
what
its
purpose
is,
what
its
practice
is.
the
sole
test
both
as
to
meaning
and
as
to
constitutionality
is
whether
the
particular
facility
to
which
the
federal
funds
have
earmarked,
whether
that
particular
facility
is
not
used
either
for
sectarian
instruction
or
religious
worship.
if
that
facility,
an
island
of
secularity
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
sectarianism,
is
clear
of
religion,
then
it
matters
not
what
the
sea
is
and,
therefore,
the
court
found
that
in
finding
of
fact,
the
only
finding
of
facts
make
laws
that
we
presented
no
evidence.
indeed,
we
do
not
contend,
we
did
not
contest
the
fact
that
these
four
institutions,
the
facilities
which
were
financed
in
part
with
federal
funds,
were
not
used
for
religious
instruction
or
religious
worship.
indeed,
the
evidence
showed
there
was
no
crucifixes
there,
no
religious
images,
that
they
were
completely
secular.
and,
the
court
below,
adopting
the
government's
position,
simply
disregard
and
felt
--
deemed
irrelevant
all
the
evidence
presented
as
to
the
nature
of
these
institutions.
now
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
court,
in
effect,
held
this.
this
is
a
fair
conclusion,
i
believe,
of
what
the
court
has
held
and
what
the
government
contends
that
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
for
the
government
to
appropriate
funds
for
building
facilities
and,
i
want
to
interrupt
for
one
moment,
the
current
facilities
that
had
been
interpreted
by
the
commissioner
quite
broadly,
doesn't
mean
necessarily
a
building.
a
library
or
a
chemistry
laboratory
in
a
building,
the
rest
of
the
building,
which
is
committed
and
devoted
to
religious
teaching,
so
long
as
that
library
itself
is
not
used
for
that
purpose,
that
library
can
be
financed.
now,
an
institution
which
admits
only
students
of
a
particular
religion,
requires
them
to
participate
in
religious
activities,
compels
them
to
comply
with
the
doctrines
and
documents
of
the
religion,
forces
them
to
attend
church,
requires
them
under
penalty
of
dismissal
to
take
instruction
in
the
theology
and
doctrines
of
that
religion,
and
does
everything
to
propagate
and
advance
a
particular
religion
other
than
conferred
degrees
in
divinity,
that
such
an
institution
can
constitutionally
receive
governmental
funds
so
long
as,
in
its
bookkeeping,
it
allocates
those
funds
to
the
construction
of
a
chemistry
laboratory
or
a
biology
classroom.
this
is
the
crux
of
the
court's
decision.
i
cannot
see
how
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
forbids
a
religious
test
for
public
office,
nevertheless,
permits
the
financing
of
public
facilities
which
are
barred
to
anybody
but
members
of
a
particular
religion.
this,
yet,
is
what
the
government's
position--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
we
believe
that
such
a
finding
could've
been
made
by
the
court.
among
one
of
these
institutions,
over
95%
of
the
students
are
catholic.
we
do
not
contend
necessarily
that
any
one
of
these
institutions
fits
this
description,
but
we
do
not
concede
that
they
do
not.
we
are
unable
to
draw
conclusions
because
the
court
below
made
no
relevant
finding
of
the
fact.
it
says
all
relevant
--
irrelevant.
we
don't
care
how
many
students
there
are.
we
don't
care
if
the
students
are
required
to
take
theology.
we
don't
care
if
they're
all
catholic.
so
long
as
the
money
is
allocated
to
that
part
of
the
institution
from
which
religion
is
excluded,
this
is,
within
the
purview
of
the
statute,
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
that
at
least
shows
at
least
one
of
the
institutions
has
over
95%
catholic.
it
shows
that
it
advertises
a
primarily
catholic
periodical.
it
asks--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
i
said
that.
i
said--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said
the
court
could
have
so
found
at
least
one
of
them.
it
could
have
so
found.
it
made
no
findings.
it
could've
made
so
found--
had
it
so
found,
i
believe,
such
a
finding
would've
been
supported
by
the
evidence
in
the
record,
but
we
don't
know
what
the
court
found.
the
court
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
and
but,
more
important,
these
four
institutions
are
really
not
the
important
thing
in
this
case.
we
brought
them
in
only
to
create
a
record,
to
provide
specificity
to
use
the
language
in
(inaudible)
of
this
court.
but,
the
commissioner
who
is
the
real
defendant
in
this
case
is
applying
this
law
nationwide.
we're
perfect
in
wanting
to
drop
the
suit
against
these
four
defendants.
we
have
no
desire
to
recoup
any
of
the
money
they've
gotten.
we
are
seeking
an
adjudication
which
will
be
a
guide
to
the
commissioner
of
education
in
carrying
out
the
functions,
duties,
and
obligation
under
this
act.
now,
we
claim
that,
first,
our
argument
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
we
believe
that
the
statute
can
be
reasonably
read
to
limit
it
to
such
institutions
which
are
not
sectarian
in
the
sense
which
we
have
indicated,
in
the
sense
which
has
been
used
in
the
state
courts
in
interpreting
their
own
statutes,
let's
say
there
are
150
years
of
judicial
interpretation
of
the
word
“sectarian.”
we
do
not
contend
and
we've
never
contended
that
merely
because
the
institution
is
church-related
that
it's
disqualified
or
congress
intended
it
to
be
disqualified.
now,
we
think
it
is
reasonable
and,
under
the
well-established
rules,
the
court
should
seek
if
it
really
reads
it
that
way,
it
should
seek
to
interpret
the
statute
according
to
the
context
in
which
i
have
suggested.
certainly,
it's
far
more
acceptable
and
far
more
defensible
or
far
more
acceptable
an
interpretation
than,
for
example,
the
interpretation
of
supreme
being
in
the
seigard
(ph)
case--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed,
it
has
administered
in
the
other
premise.
that's
why
we're
in
court,
or
else
we
wouldn't
be
in
court.
but
leaving
aside
any
further
discussions
of
constitutionality,
how
could
we
just
inextricably
wound
up
with
constitutionality,
we
claim
that
it
is
part
of
the
constitutional
law
of
the
united
states
and
of
all
the
states
in
the
union
that
public
funds
may
not
be
used
to
finance
the
operation
and
construction
of
an
institution,
a
sectarian
institution,
of
a
type
which
we
have
described.
we
believe
that
is
a
principle
which
is
as
--
might
be
said
to
be
part
of
the
common
law
of
the
american
constitutional
system.
it
was
given
its
most,
perhaps,
broadest
pronouncement
in
the
everson
case
in
1947
in
upholding
bus
transportation.
the
everson
case,
a
5:4
split,
was
--
would've
meant
nothing
if
there
were
not
agreement
that
you
could
not
finance
the
operations
of
the
institution
itself.
the
everson
principle
has
been
criticized
because
of
the
term
“no
aid”
is
too
broad
in
this
court,
and
it
also
suggested
that
may
be
too
broad.
the
everson
principle
is
not
a
no-aid
principle.
the
everson
principle
is
no
subsidy
principle,
and
the
court
distinguished
it.
it
distinguished
it
in
walz.
it
distinguished
in
allan,
the
textbook
case,
between
aiding
an
institution
which
the
government
does
many
times
and
subsidizing
it,
financing
it.
that,
what
we
contend,
is
unconstitutional.
now,
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
as
the
government
takes
exemption
to
it,
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
a
precedent
to
this
higher
educational
facilities
act
of
1963,
for
governmental
financing
the
construction
operations
of
a
sectarian
institution.
the
government
says,
ever
since--
in
their
brief,
ever
since
the
moral
act,
the
land
grant
act
of
1962,
the
government
has
financed
church-related
institutions.
we've
said
sectarian
and
gives
us
evidence
for
that,
support,
for
that
assertion
a
study
made
by
the
brazilian
library
of
congress
which
is
reported
in
the
congressional
record,
listing
the
educational
institutions,
church-related
educational
institutions
which
have
received
land
grant
funds.
i
should
like
to,
with
the
brief
list,
i
should
like
to
list--
read
you
the
list
of,
i
think,
less
than
a
dozen
institutions
which
are
cited
in
support
of
this
assertion.
brown
university,
yale
university,
rutgers
university,
dartmouth
university,
university
of
kentucky,
university
of
delaware,
atlanta
university,
maryland
state
college,
auburn
university,
kansas
state
university,
university
of
california.
yes,
university
of
california
and
kansas
state
university.
how
are
these
church-related?
well,
each
one
has
a
little
comment
to
show
how
it's
church-related.
i
will
read
only
one,
kansas
state
university.
to
the
naked
eye,
i
assume
one
would
not
suspect
kansas
state
university
to
be
church-related,
but
this
government
says
it
is.
it
reads
as
follows.
kansas
state
university:
methodist
church
gave
bluemont
central
college
to
state
as
site
for
new
agricultural
college
which
was
to
receive
land
grant
funds.
the
kansas
state
agricultural
college
became
the
state
university.
this
is
the
whole
comment.
ergo,
it
follows
that
the
government
has
given
money
to
a
church
related
college.
i
submit,
your
honors,
if
this
proves
anything,
it
proves
the
opposite
of
what
the
government
decided
for.
it
proves
the
recognition
that
bluemont
college,
so
long
as
it
was
part
of
the
methodist
church,
could
not
receive
government
funds.
so,
what
was
done?
a
gift
that
was
made
to
a
state
university
of
the
state
of
kansas,
the
state
of
kansas
made
a
public
institution
and
it
received
funds.
this
is,
i
submit,
an
argument
which
does
not
stand
strongly
in
this
case.
now,
i
recognize
that
the
everson
decision
is
a
decision
of
this
court
and
what
this
court
gives,
this
court
can
take
away.
and,
if
the
everson
principle
is
dead,
perhaps
this
court
should
say
so.
my
argument
is
that
the
court
has
not
said
so,
that
notwithstanding
the
criticism
and
it
is
legion.
there's
hardly
law
reviews
in
the
country
which
is
said
to
have
from
time
to
time,
now
for
showing
how
broad
the
everson
dictum
is
and
criticizing
for
its
over
breath,
but
the
supreme
judiciary
body
of
the
united
states
is
not
the
law
reviews.
it's
not
the
briefs
of
counsel.
it
is
this
court,
and
i
submit
that
this
court
has
not
in
any
way
impaired
the
integrity
of
the
basic
principle
of
everson
of
no
financing
of
sectarian
institutions.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
conclusion
is
certainly
not
a--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
judgment
said,
and
indeed
this
is
how
everson
has
been
interpreted
every
one
of
the
cases.
this
statute
is
constitutional
because
it
does
not
subsidize
the
operations
of
a
parochial
school.
it
does
not
finance
it.
this
statute
is
constitutional
because
it
cites--
it
provides
welfare
or
safety
benefits.
the
court
said
it
deals
with
just
the
same
as
the
policeman
in
the
corner.
it's
to
protect
the
children
from
the
hazards
of
the
road.
it
does
not.
and
in
allan,
the
textbook
case,
the
court
said
the
same
thing.
this
statute
does
not
subsidize,
does
not
finance
the
operations
of
the
parochial
school.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
could
say
that.
i
wonder
how
it
could
say
it
if
it
says
what--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
could
say
it,
but
respectfully
with
a
good
deal
less
validity.
i
don't
know
how
a
court
can
say
that
financing
a
building,
which
is
part
of
the
institution,
not
financing
an
institution.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
answer
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
everson
was
based
on
the
fact
that
transportation
was
not
their
tool.
the
majority
claims
were
lost.
the
four
justices,
justice
rattles,
mr.
justice
jackson
asserted
that
loss,
but
the
majority
of
the
court
said
it
is
not.
they
said
it's
a
tool
of
public
safety.
it
is
to
protect
the
children
from
getting
run
over.
that's
what
the--
that's
the
premise
of
the
everson
case
and
this
is
how
it's
been
interpreted.
now,
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
overrule
everson,
i
think
it
should
do
so
in
clear
unambiguous
language.
i
should
like
to
quote
to
the
court
a
short
statement
from
the
credos
of
chief
justices.
he
said,
in
united
states
against
burke
(ph),
an
opinion
which
is
to
overrule
all
former
precedents
and
to
establish
a
principle
never
before
recognized
should
be
expressed
in
plain
and
explicit
terms.
a
mere
implication
ought
not
to
prostrate
a
principle
which
seems
to
have
been
so
well
established,
general
expressions
ought
not
to
be
considered
as
overruling
the
settled
principles
without
a
direct
declaration
to
that
effect.
if
this
court
is
prepared
to
correct
a
century-and-a
half
of
error,
i
submit
it
should
do
so
clearly
and
unambiguously.
i
submit
further
that
it
had
not
done
so.
in
no
case
has
this
court
in
any
way
impaired
the
integrity
of
the
basic
principle
of
everson,
no
financing
or
subsidy
of
the
operations
or
constructions
of
a
sectarian
institution
in
the
sense
which
we
are
using
that
term.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
will
–
bradfield,
at
this
particular
point
and
no
point--
no
need
to
respond.
bradfield
against
roberts
was
an
1899
decision
in
which
the
supreme
court
unanimously
upheld
a
contract
between
the
city
of
washington
and
a
corporation
formed
by
an
order
of
nuns
to
operate
the
providence
hospital
in
the
city
of
washington.
the
court
held
the
statute
constitutional
on
two
basic
concepts.
first,
that
there
was
nothing
sectarian
in
the
operation
of
the
hospital.
this
hospital,
as
the
court
said,
is
operated
according
to
its
charter
and
it
is
not
the
hospital
which
operates
--
which
treats
ill
people.
it
does
not
teach,
it
does
not
propagate
religion.
within
the
term
of
“sectarian”
as
we've
used
in
this
case,
it
is
not
a
sectarian
institution.
the
court
indicated
that
as
a
separate
corporation,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
critical
factor.
i
think
the
law
pierces
a
corporate
veil
to
prevent
fraud.
i
think
the
law
would
pierce
a
corporate
veil
to
prevent
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
but
the
critical
factor
is
not
whether
this
is
a
legal
fiction,
a
separate
corporation,
but
whether
this
is
in
truth
and
in
fact
an
institution
which
propagates
and
practice
religion.
it
says
it
does
not
propagate
--
propagates
blessing
and
teaches--
it
teaches
medicine.
secondly,
here's
another
critical
distinction,
the
court
pointed
out
that
no
person
is
denied
admission
and
treatment
to
that
hospital
because
of
the
religion
or
faith.
it
does
not
limit
it
to
the
members
of
that
faith.
it
said,
indeed,
it
had
to
be
because,
as
part
of
its
contract
with
the
city
of
washington,
it
had
to
take
indigent
patients.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
a
state
cannot
make
a
contract
--
a
federal
government
can't
make
a
contract
with
a
sectarian
educational
institution
of
the
type
of
this
kind
whereby
the
state
will
pay
that
institution
money
and
send
its
students
there.
it
can
do
it
with
a
hospital.
but,
the
institution
has
a
right
to
say,
indeed,
it
has
a
constitutional
right
to
say
“under
the
religious
liberty
clause,
we
will
not
admit
anybody
here
unless
he's
part
of
our
faith
and,
indeed,
if
he
is
part
of
our
faith,
as
the
record
shows,
he
must
take
catholic
theology
or
lutheran
theology,
must
go
to
mass
or
to
communion.”
this
is
a
condition
which
a
sectarian
institution
has,
under
the
free
exercise
clause
an
absolute
right
to
make.
that
was
not
followed
in
bradfield
against
roberts.
now,
if
i
am
correct
that,
up
to
the
present,
this
court
has
not
impaired
the
integrity
of
the
basis
of
everson,
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
funds
which
are
allocated
are
earmarked
for
a
particular
facility
which,
of
itself,
is
not
religion.
i--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a
welfare
activity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
was
--
that's
not
all.
in
which
activity
was--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
was
available
to
everybody.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
that's
part
of
the
picture.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
subject
to
certain
other
qualifications,
but
not--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
subject
to
qualifications.
yes,
to
a
non-religious
activity
but
not
one
which
is
limited
to
the
members
of
that
faith
or
which
has
a
religious
bar
or
determination
as
to
who
can
get
the
benefit
of
that
facility.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
would've
if
every
patient
were
required
to
go
to
the
prayer
as
they
are
religious
institutions.
it
would've
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
in
these
institutions,
the
record
shows
that
catholic
--
participation
in
catholic
theology
courses
is
required.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
that
would've
been
enough
to
make
a
difference.
i
don't
think
that--
if
that's
all
there
was,
i
don't
think
that
would
have
bordered
in
to
the
framework
of
a
sectarian
educational
institution
of
the
type
which
i've
discussed.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
nor
that
each
nurse
was
a
nun.
i
think
what's
critical--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
that
was
enough.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
don't
see
what
the
relevance
of
whether
the
church
would've
carried
on
anyway
or
not.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say,
yes.
i--
in
fact,
i
can't
see
what
that--
how
that
makes
the
constitutional--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that,
i
don't--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
not
that
bookkeeping
isn't
very
important.
the
point
of
bookkeeping
is
important
for
this
reason.
the
bookkeeping
is
important
that
it's
not
because
it
saves
the
church's
money,
but
because
--
indeed,
it's
not
important.
i
think
it's
absolutely
not
important,
but
not
for
the
reason
which
you
might
be
suggesting.
it's
not
important
because
the
money
is
used
not
to
save
the
church
money.
now,
the
church
money
may
not
have--
that
might
be
a
case
of
the
church
has
to
go
indeed,
as
a
claim.
they
have
to
go
out
of
business,
unless
they
get
the
federal
funds.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
not--
it
was--
again,
i
must
go
back,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
that,
but
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
to--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
a
subsidy
to
operate
a
public
service
available
to
all
of
the
public
without
any
requirements
of
religion,
without
being
required--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
not
the
sub--
i
never
said
the
constitution
forbids
a
subsidy
of
a
religious
institution.
i--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said
of
an
institution
which
is
engaged
in
the
propagation
and
teaching
of
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
hospital
did
not
engage.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
cath--
but,
not
the
hospital.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
exactly,
an
activity
which
is
a
religious
activity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
teaching
of
mathematics
in
a
building
may
be
a
religious
activity,
it
may
not--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
say
the
government
cannot
subsidize
the
construction
of
a
building
whether
they
called
it
religious
or
not
religious.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
nobody
was
barred
from
entering
that
hospital
because
of
religion,
and
i
cannot
get
away
from
that.
this
is
a
critical
difference.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
it
could
not--
it
should,
but
it
could
not
bar
a
non-member
of
any
particular
religion
because
there
isn't
funding,
and
i
cannot
see
how,
if
the
government
can
do
it
itself,
it
could
subsidize
somebody
else
to
do
what
it's
hoping
to
do.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
indeed,
it
would.
it
will
do
it.
now,
if
you
take,
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
you
take
your
argument
and
carry
it
out--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
mean,
you're--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'm
sorry.
your
suggestion--[laughter]
your
suggestion.
thinking
to
meet
your
question,
suppose
you
have
a
church
which
does
nothing
but
prayer
and
worship,
and
the
government
gives
it
money
to
be
used
only
for
construction
of
new
furnace
room
because
the
furnaces
are
out
of
order
and
the
church
had
no
money.
so,
the
government
gives
it
money
to
construct
the
furnace
room
of
that
church.
is
that
constitutional?
i
don't--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
is
indeed.
the
argument
which
we
make
and
the
case
which
we
make
and
the
court
said
that
even,
by
its
decision,
that
even
so,
if
the
chemistry
laboratory,
if
the
biology
laboratory,
is
there
an
order
to
make
it
possible
for
a
student
to
get
all
of
their
education
under
religious
hospices
which
is
what
the
court
said
in
walz,
then,
this
chemistry
lab
is
just
as
much
part
of
the
whole
religious
unit
as
is
the
room
used
for
teaching
religion
or
for
prayer.
now,
i
must--
in
view
of
the
time,
i
must
go,
if
you'll
permit
me,
to
the
walz
test
which
is
the
latest
voice
of
this
court,
the
latest
statement
of
this
court
on
what
the
establishment
clause
means.
the
walz--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
i'm--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
i
am
not
contending
that
at
all.
i'm
contending
all
tests:
everson,
schempp,
allen,
and
walz.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
are
basically
all
the
same.
they
are
different
formulations
of
what
i've
said
to
be
150
years
of
constitutional
law
of
the
united
states.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
change,
this
court
has
to
make
it.
i
am
not
challenging
the
constitutional
law.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
walz
doesn't.
walz
said
and
the
difference
is
that
exemption
applies
no
surveillance,
no
entanglement,
subsidy
does.
and,
entanglement
and
surveillance
here,
there
is
galore.
the
act
provides
that
for
20
years
a
facility
is
used,
if
any
time
in
the
20
years
a
facility
financed
with
federal
funds
is
used
for
sectarian
worship
or
prayer,
the
institution
must
pay
back
to
the
government.
for
20--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
belongs
to
the
institution.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
could.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
at
then
even
and,
presumably
--
i
am
not
saying
that's
constitutional
but,
presumably,
the
government
feels
that
20
years
is
the
life
expectancy
of
the
building.
after
20
years,
it
is
so
depreciated
in
value,
perhaps
you
can
do
anything
you
want.
i
presume
that's
the
rationale,
but
look--
but
if
your
honors
please,
what
is
required
under
this
statute?
the
government
must
keep
an
eye
on
that
institution
for
20
years
unless
religious
teachings
be
bootlegged
in
to
a
humanity
class
because,
if
it
does,
it
violates
the
law.
this
is
surveillance
for
20
years.
moreover,
in
everson,
this
court
ruled
not
only
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
a
public
institution
to
finance
institution
to
teach
the
genesis
version
of
creation,
but
it's
unconstitutional
not
to
teach
the
darwinian
version
of
creation,
of
evolution.
so
that,
this
court
–
united
states
will
have
to
police
these
colleges,
make
sure
not
only
they
do
not
teach
genesis
evolution
or
creation
according
to
genesis,
that
they
must
teach
creation
according
to
darwin.
this
is
surveillance
of
the
most
extreme
kind.
this
is
the
entanglement
of
the
state
and
religion
of
a
type
which
every
decision
of
this
court.
going
back
to
watson
against
jones,
1870,
every
decision
which
the
court
said
that
governments
keep
out,
censoring,
looking
into
the--
what's
happening
in
the
religious
institution.
it's
done
it
in
the
russian
orthodox
cases.
it's
done
that
in
the
catholic
against
connecticut.
it
says
this--
we
are
not
to
go
into
the
insti--
the
ecclesiastical,
theological,
or
religious
institution
and
spy
upon
them
or
oversee
them
or
entangle
ourselves
in
their
activities.
i
cannot
see
how,
under
this
statute,
the
government,
to
be
faithful
to
its
constitutional
obligation,
because
i'm
sure
everybody
can
see
that
the
government
may
not
finance
a
facility
which
is
used
for
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
accord--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
according
to--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
according
to
what
appeared
from
the
government,
the
government
will
be--
will
probably
be
in
better
position
to
answer
this
than
i.
if
they
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
there
may
be
use
of
the
premises
for
religion,
they
inspect
it
and
they
can
and
do
exercise
control
to
make
sure
that
either
that's
discontinued
or
that
appropriate
countermeasures
are
taken.
now,
i
don't
know--
i'm
not
privy
to
how
they
administer
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there's
no
way
of
avoiding
it.
there's
no
avoiding
either
the
constitutional
barrier
or
the
statutory
barrier.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
it
says
you
shall--
the
statute
says
if
this
facility
is
used
in
violation
of
this
provision
as
well
as
other
provisions,
i'm
not
talking
only
about
this
provision,
within
a
20
year
period,
that
the
institution
must
reimburse
the
government
funds.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
know.
i
could
not
answer.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
the
government
would
have
to
answer
that,
but
whether
there
are
or
aren't
i
think
is
not
constitutional.
i
think
if
they
aren't,
it
means
only
that
the
government
is
neglecting
its
constitutional
statutory
obligations.
the
test
is
not
whether
it's
doing
it.
the
test
is
whether
it's
required
by
the
law
and
the
constitution
to
do
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed,
they
are
required
by
law
and
the
constitution
to
uphold
the
statute
out
of
the
constitution.
now,
this
requires
no
other
way,
unless
they
take
the
institutions.
at
least
they
don't
--
at
least
they
don't
if
there's
some
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
under
the
walz
test.
it
is
not
the
only
thing.
there
is
far
more
than
that,
but
this
is
--
it
is
our
contention
that
no
matter
how
you
look
at
this,
how
you
look
at
this
is
unconstitutional.
the
basic
premise
is
a
premise
which
has
only
estops
the
constitutional
law.
these
troubles
which
have
been
had
both
before
this
court
and
the
law
reviews
and
the
law
rights
of
how
to
formulate
that,
but
the
heart
and
blood
of
it
is
that
you
cannot
tax
the
whole
community
to
support
a
religious
enterprise
whose
purpose
is
to
propagate
to
teach
religion
and
it
bars
from
its
facilities
those
who
are
not
of
that
faith.
that,
to
me,
is
basic
constitutional
law
and
i
don't
think
any
test,
however
formulated,
can
get
away
from
a
face
to
face
encounter
with
that
basic
proposition.
now,
one
word
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
didn't
--
that's
not
the
ground.
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
surely.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
absolutely.
i'm
saying
that
that
secular
--
under
the
entanglement
test,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
under
the
entanglement
test
makes
no
difference
because
it
still
requires
surveillance
to
keep
it
that.
you
can't--
unless
you
want
to
overrule--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
unless
the
court
wants
to
overrule
everson,
wants
to
overrule
walz
and,
i
believe,
overrule
howe
too.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
subject
to
the
condition
which
i've
repeated
many
times.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
can't
get
away
from
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because,
otherwise,
the
mere
fact--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
mere
fact--[laughter]
more
than
that--
it's
more
than
that.
i
hope
so.
there
mere
fact
that
the
institution
is
limited
to
the
members
of
the
faith,
as
the
members
of
the
faith
are
required
to
accept
instruction,
which
they
are,
in
that
faith
as
a
condition
to
using
that
facility
which
is
a
case
here.
it
indicates
to
me,
sir,
that
that
facility
is
a
means
now
and
then.
it's
there
in
order
to
make
sure
that
we
get
kids
who
will
take
religion.
they
won't
take--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
what
i
mean.
i
mean,
why
does
an
institution
which
is,
in
this
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
religious,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
its--
anybody
could
go
in
there,
it
is
not
part
of
the
institution.
it's
not
a
means
to
achieve
the
end
of
the
institution.
we
cannot--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
is
not
enough
for--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
is
not
enough
for
me
and
those
facts
are
not
enough
for
me
to
express
an
opinion,
but
i
don't
have
that
here.
i'm
not
required
to
express
an
opinion
there.
that's
not
in
any
of
these
cases.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
would
not
necessarily,
but
if
--
in
order
to
get
into
that
theater
you
had
to
go
first
through
a
chapel
where
you
got
a
sermon
on
the
religion
and
then
you
went
to
the
theater,
i
would
say
we'd
have
an
analogous
case
here.
that's
what
i
would
say
because
that's
exactly
what
the
government
might
say
it
is
perfectly
permissible.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
it
wouldn't
--
i
will
not
say
whether
it
will
be
permissible,
but
i'm
saying
what
conditions
it
would
not
be
permissible.
i
think
--
because,
that,
i
think
is
what's
relevant
here.
we
are
not
required
to
spell
out
for
the
government
what
it
may
do,
we
are
here
to
say
--
to
try
to
convince
the
court
that
what
it
has
done,
it
may
not
do.
it
may
not
say
you
cannot
go
to
the
law
school
unless
you
take
theology,
unless
you
participate
in
mass,
unless
you
are
of
the
catholic
religion
or
lutheran
or--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
then
i
say
a
very
good
case
could
be
made
out
for
saying
that,
as
in
the
maryland
case,
that
the
relationship
of
that
institution
to
the
church
is
reached
a
point
where
it's
no
longer
sectarian.
and,
indeed,
this
is
what's
happening
with
many
with
many
institutions.
it's
what
happened
with
yale,
with
harvard,
with
columbia,
with
princeton.
they
started
out
as
sectarian
institutions.
this
is
what
happened
to
some
catholic
institutions.
they're
going
through
the
same
procedure.
for
them,
georgetown,
notre
dame
--
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
that
in
10
or
15
years
the
relationship
between
notre
dame
and
the
catholic
church
will
be
somewhat
analogous
to
the
relationship
of
columbia
university
and
episcopal
church
or
princeton
and
presbyterian
church,
all
the
institutions.
now,
many
of
the
institutions
are
going
through
the
same
development,
and
they
reach
a
time,
as
the--
as
was
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
held,
when
you
can
say
that
this
is
no
longer
a
sectarian
institution.
the
public
school
system
where
the
united
states
went
through
the
same
metamorphosis,
it
started
out
as
protestant
schools,
as
bible
schools,
and
it
was
against
this
context
that
these
state
constitutions
were
written
--
provided
that
they
cannot
be
supported
because
of
they're
protestant,
not
that
they're
catholic,
they
are
protestant
church
relationship,
church
sectarians,
and
they
use
sectarians.
but,
little
by
little,
through
a
period
of
development
they
became
truly
non-sectarian
institutions,
and
i
say
that
there
are
many
such
institutions
of
higher
education
which
have
a
church
relationship,
but
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
scholarship
to
students
who
could
choose
any
college
they
want
to
go
to?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
to
exercise
my
privilege
of
not
replying
to
a
question
which
i
believe
is
not
relevant
to
this
case
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
the
issue
is
a
difficult
one
and
i
don't
want
to
foreclose
any
possible
position
which
i
could
take
at
a
future
time.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
then
perhaps
if
that's
so,
then
i
would
say,
if
assuming
you
say
that
i
say
it's
constitutional,
i'd
be
grateful
to
have
to,
but
i'm
not
prepared
at
this
point
either
to
make
the
claim
or
to
defend
it.
i'm
not
required
to
in
the
light
of
this
case,
nothing
in
the
court's
opinion
below,
nothing
in
the
position
taken
by
the
government.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said
that
allen
stressed
that
there
was
no
subsidy
to
the
institution.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
there
was
no
subsidy
there
involved
at
all,
the
use
of
books
were
involved
and
allen,
as
i
interpret
allen--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'd
rather
not
speculate
perhaps
what
allen
would've
decided.
i
would
say
it
did
not
decide
that.
what
i
think
allen
decided
was
this.
that
just
as
a
catholic
child
or
a
lutheran
child
can
go
to
a
public
library
to
borrow
a
book
which
he
needs
to
help
him
in
his
studies,
he
can
in
this
statute
--
under
this
statute,
get
it
from
a
state
directly
without
going
to
the
public
library.
but,
i
do
not
interpret
allen
to
say
that
the
fact,
that
this
book
is
limited
only
to
persons
of
a
particular
religion
would
nevertheless
make
it
constitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
in
connecticut
here's
what
we
did.
we
show
on
the
record
those
who
brought
the
suit,
i
mean
those
who
examined
the
various
institutions
in
connecticut
which
they
could
and
they
chose
--
in
bringing
the
suit,
they
chose
those
which
they
deem
to
be
basically
religious.
they
did
not
choose
others
which
were
not
sectarian
according
to
the
language
we
used,
but
did
have
church-relation.
if
your
honors
please,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i
find
it
necessary
to
correct
a
statement
on
test
made
by
mr.
williams
and
i
do
it
so
because
it
is
critical
to
this
decision.
mr.
williams
said
that
the
statute
requires
the
institutions
to
comply
with
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
forbids
all
form
of
discrimination.
and
mr.
williams
is
in
error,
it
does
not
forbid
all
forms
of
discrimination,
it
does
permit
religious
discrimination.
it
forbids
discrimination
on
race,
color,
or
national
origin
but
it
does
permit,
if
the
word
“religion”
was
deliberately
taken
off,
it
does
permit
religious
discrimination,
it
does
permit
the
use
of
federal
funds
to
finance
an
institution
which
discriminate
religiously.
this
is
critical
to
this
case
because
they
pointed
out
the
difference
between
bradfield,
difference
to
all
these
cases
is
that
this
case
allows
an
institution
to
discriminate
religiously
to
exclude
a
religious
basis.
i
also
want
to
state
and
make
clear
our
position.
we
do
not
concede
any
fact
other
than
the
fact
that
the
institutions
which
are
connecticut
or
all
over
the
united
states
do
make
a
written
commitment
that
in
the
particular
facilities
by
that
they
will
not
teach
or
practice
religion.
we
do
not
agree
with
mr.
williams’
interpretation
of
the
record
below.
we
have
here,
we
prepared
shot
so
our
analysis
of
the
evidence
which
reads
conclusive
directly
contrary
to
mr.
williams,
we
didn’t
bring
them
here
because
there’d
be
no
findings
of
fact,
we
don’t
believe
this
is
a
trial
court.
there
is
--
was
a
great
dispute
in
the
court
below
between
valid
evidences
relevant.
we
contended
the
element
was
relevant
with
that
which
dealt
with
the
time
when
the
grants
to
these
institutions
were
authorized
by
the
government.
most
of
the
testimony
the
evidence
put
forth
by
mr.
williams
why
we
didn’t
cross-examine.
we
objected
to
it.
dealt
with
facts
which
occurred
after,
after
those
grants
were
authorized,
which
occurred
up
to
date
of
trial
and
even
which
have
been
planned
for
future
implementation.
there
were
two
different
institutions
in
each
case.
one
when
the
grant
was
made.
one
when
the
trial
was
conducted.
we
contend
that
the
evidence
which
we
present
as
of
the
time
when
the
grants
were
authorized
did
justify
a
finding
of
fact
that
at
least
one
or
more
of
these
institutions
did
exclude
students
who
were
not
of
the
requisite
phase.
now,
if
the
court
deems
that
to
be
a
critical
fact
as
i
believe
it
is,
i
think
the
court
is
not
a
trial
court.
it
didn’t
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses.
it
should,
i
believe,
remand
it
to
determine
those
facts.
now,
on
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
if
we
did
and
all
i
can
say
mr.
justice
that
for
well
over
a
century
and
a
half.
every
state
in
the
union
bar
not
was
guilty
of
the
violation
of
the
freedom
of
religion
of
thousands
of
thousands
of
people
because
never
before
and
i
repeat
again,
before
this
act
do
we
find
a
situation
where
public
funds
are
used
to
subsidize
an
institution
of
education
institution
limited
to
one
phase.
now,
on
respect
of
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
the
contrary,
i
think
the
whole
constitution
must
be
considered.
i
--
my
argument
is
--
our
confession
is
on
the
contrary
that
the
history
of
the
struggle
for
freedom
of
religion
in
this
country
is
a
large
measure
--
a
history
of
a
struggle
against
compulsory
taxation
for
religious
purposes.
and
it’s
our
contention
on
the
contrary
that
the
tax
make
a
non-catholic
in
order
to
support
an
institution
where
she
is
catholic
probably
took
even
if
it’s
only
to
catholic
students
as
mr.
williams
has
conceded,
even
that
to
me
i
can
sense
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
now,
in
respect
to
the
bradfield
against
roberts,
mr.
williams
has
spoke
of,
i
tried
yesterday
to
distinguish
that
in
the
brief
spent
a
considerable
time
at
but
i
think
the
test
can
be
set
to
be
this
to
distinguish
bradfield
and
other
cases.
the
test
is
whether
the
facility
is
free
standing
or
intergraded
into
the
totality
of
a
curriculum
whereby
the
same
student
is
exposed
to
the
propagation
of
religion
and
the
institution
has
its
major
partners
to
propagate
religion
to
that
student.
what
i
mean
by
this
is
that
if
in
order,
if
the
services
at
the
hospital
are
part
of
a
unit
which
includes
the
inculcation
of
religious
doctrine
and
the
student
and
the
patient
must
take
both
his
treatment
for
his
disease
and
propagation
of
religion,
that’s
unconstitutional.
that
is
a
situation
in
this
case.
no
person
can
walk
off
the
street
and
comment
and
say,
“i
want
to
use
this
chemistry
laboratory
or
in
this
biology
laboratory
or
i
want
to
enroll
only
for
this
one
cause.”
he
is
a
complete
student.
he
must
take
a
whole
works
inc
--
if
he’s
a
catholic
certain.
he
must
take
the
whole
works
including
of
course
in
the
propagation
of
the
catholic
religion.
that,
i
believe
is
the
test.
now
one
word
about
pertinence,
we
are
in
this
court
because
the
congress
is
coordinate
branch
of
government.
this
court
is
of
course

mr.

yesterday
pointed

the

found

thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
tax
payer
suit
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
said--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
this
is
a
tax
payer
suit
challenging
both
the
interpretation
and,
secondarily,
the
constitutionality
of
title
1
of
the
higher
education
facilities
act
of
1963.
the
statute
provides
for
grounds
of
federal
funds
to
construct
what
is
called
academic
facilities
at
undergraduate
educational
institutions
at
the
post
secondary
level
and,
as
far
as
it's
relevant
to
this
case,
it
defines
academic
facilities
among
others,
as
those
which
--
to
exclude
those
used
for
sectarian
instruction
or
religious
worship
or
any
part
of
which
--
the
school
which
is
part
of
it,
the
school
or
department
of
divinity.
other
than
that,
it
does
not
contain
any
expressed
exclusion
on
predicated
part
of
the
nature
of
the
beneficiary
institution.
the
questions
as
presented
by
this
appeal,
as
we
see
it,
first,
is
not,
although
that
appears
to
be
housing
both,
all
appellees
seek
to
frame
it
is
not
whether
church-related
colleges
are
disqualified
from
participating
in
the
benefits
of
the
statute.
if
it
were,
if
that
was
the
question,
we
would
not
be
here.
we
concede
and
have
never
contended
to
the
contrary
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
college
is
church-related
does
not
either
statutorily
or
constitutionally
disqualify
it
from
receiving
federal
funds.
the
question,
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
a
sectarian
institution
is
disqualified
both
statutorily
and
constitutionally.
now,
we've
defined
in
our
complaint,
in
our
briefs
what
we
mean
by
sectarian
and,
specifically,
we
call
it
one
in
which
the
propagation,
teaching,
or
practice
of
religion
is
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
its
existence.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is--
well,
the
latest
is
in
reply
brief--
i'm
reading
from
reply
brief,
page
3.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
in
our
original
brief
as
well,
but
i'm
reading
now
from
reply
brief.
it's
in
the
original
brief
as
well.
the
propagation
in
teaching,
or
practice
of
religion
is
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
its
existence.
this
case
was
brought
before
this
court
decided
walz
against
tax
commission
of
new
york.
had
this
case
been
brought
after
that
decision,
perhaps
it
would've
defined
sectarian
in
terms
of
the
court's
decision
in
walz
as
one
whose
dominant
policy
is
to
assure
future
adherence
to
a
particular
faith
by
having
control
of
their
total
education--
by
having
the
--
to
a
particular
faith
by
having
control
of
their
total
education
at
an
early
age.
that's
in
the
walz
case.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
basically--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
they're
preferable
in
the
sense
that
it's
wiser
to
use
the
language
of
a
recent
decision
of
the
courts
than
to
use
your
own
language.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but,
basically,
i
don't
consider
any
substantial
difference
between
them.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
they're
basically
synonymous.
now--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
total
education,
as
i
understand
it,
the
total
education
involves,
now
i
think,
in
the
context,
what
it
meant
was
that
instead
of
assuring
adherence
to
faith
by
teaching
them
only
religion
and
allowing
them
to
go
to
a
secular
institution
for
secular
education,
it
says
total
education
so
that
it
has,
as
it
were,
control
of
both
the
secular
and
the
religious
aspects.
that's
how
i
interpret
total
education.
i
believe
that's
what
was
intended
within
the
context.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
how
many
are
there?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
how
many
different
faiths
have--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
for
parochial
schools
or
how
many
different
faiths
have
church-related
institutions,
which
is
completely
different--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
major
ones,
as
i
know,
the
major
ones
are
the
jewish,
the
lutheran,
the
seventh
day
adventist,
and
of
course
the
roman
catholics.
those
are
the
majors,
there
are
some
episcopalians.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
have
no
definition
which
necessarily
characterizes
an
institution
as
sectarian
or
merely
church-related
simply
on
the
basis
of
a
faith
to
which
it
bears
relationship.
there
are
many,
many
institutions
which
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
so.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
so,
if
we
use
the
term
church-related.
if
we
use
the
term
“sectarian,”
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
it's
not
a
meaningful
or
major,
then
it's
not
sectarian.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
but
there
are
some
of
those
in
which
the
relationship
to
the
church
is
so
tenuous,
it's
a
vestige
of
a
nation's
history.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
it
may
be
very
well
be
the
mere
fact
that
this
catholic
does
not
necessarily
mean
it
must
be
sectarian,
and
there
are
catholic
institutions
which--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i'm
afraid,
i
can't
think
of
any,
but--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
can't.
i
can
think
of
episcopalians.
i
can't
think
of
unitarians.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i
think
it's
quite
possible.
there
are
those--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
for
example--
let
me
give
you
an
example
why
there
are
jewish,
what
are
known
as
sole
malachim
schools
which
are
jewish
secular
schools.
they
do
not
have
a
religious
commutation.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
i'm
just
talking
about--
at
this
point,
we're
talking
about
colleges.
we're
not
talking
about
anything
else.
as
mr.
justice
brennan's--
responding
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
inquiry,
i'm
not--
parochial
schools--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
sure.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
to
my
knowledge,
all--
that
they
would
all
be
deemed
sectarian.
i
think
there
are
episcopalians
which
would
not
and,
certainly,
ethical
culture,
which
this
court
held--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
pardon
me?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
baptist?
baptists
have
very
little
parochial
schools.
they
don't
have
that.
they
don't
use
that.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
they
have
parochial
schools
either.
i
don't
think
they
have
parochial
schools.
now,
the
reason
we
have
used
the
term
“sectarian”
in
this
brief
and
in
our
procedure
because
that's
a
term
which
has
a
long
history
behind
it.
33
of
the
50
states
in
the
union
used
the
term
“sectarian,”
and
none
of
them
uses
the
term
“church-related.”
and,
indeed,
the
statute
which
is
initial
here
uses
the
word
“sectarian”
and
does
not
use
the
word
“church-related.”
now,
the
posture
of
this
controversy,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
court
below
did
not
pass
upon
the
basic
issue
which
we
presented,
we
had
a
trial
in
which
we
sought
to
present
evidence
with
respect
to
four
institutions
in
connecticut,
all
catholic,
to
show
primarily
to
present
to
create
a
record
as
to
what
might
be
deemed
sectarian
and
what
might
not
be.
we
had
precedent
for
that
in
state
court
in
maryland
just
two
or
three
years
ago.
there
were
four
institutions
which
were
challenged
under
a
similar
statute.
the
court
held
three
of
them
sectarian.
one
said
the
relationship
of
that
fourth
institution
to
a
faith,
to
religion,
was
so
tangential
that
it
could
not
be
deemed
sectarian,
but
the
court
took
the
position--
the
court--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
basically.
the
court
below
took
the
position
that
under
the
statute,
and
this
was
a
position
urged
by
the
government
and
this
is
the
position--
this
is
the
interpretation
that
the
commissioner
has
applied
throughout
the
nation,
that
it
is
completely
irrelevant
as
to
what
the
beneficiary
institution
is,
what
it
was
created
for,
what
its
purpose
is,
what
its
practice
is.
the
sole
test
both
as
to
meaning
and
as
to
constitutionality
is
whether
the
particular
facility
to
which
the
federal
funds
have
earmarked,
whether
that
particular
facility
is
not
used
either
for
sectarian
instruction
or
religious
worship.
if
that
facility,
an
island
of
secularity
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
sectarianism,
is
clear
of
religion,
then
it
matters
not
what
the
sea
is
and,
therefore,
the
court
found
that
in
finding
of
fact,
the
only
finding
of
facts
make
laws
that
we
presented
no
evidence.
indeed,
we
do
not
contend,
we
did
not
contest
the
fact
that
these
four
institutions,
the
facilities
which
were
financed
in
part
with
federal
funds,
were
not
used
for
religious
instruction
or
religious
worship.
indeed,
the
evidence
showed
there
was
no
crucifixes
there,
no
religious
images,
that
they
were
completely
secular.
and,
the
court
below,
adopting
the
government's
position,
simply
disregard
and
felt
--
deemed
irrelevant
all
the
evidence
presented
as
to
the
nature
of
these
institutions.
now
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
court,
in
effect,
held
this.
this
is
a
fair
conclusion,
i
believe,
of
what
the
court
has
held
and
what
the
government
contends
that
it
is
perfectly
constitutional
for
the
government
to
appropriate
funds
for
building
facilities
and,
i
want
to
interrupt
for
one
moment,
the
current
facilities
that
had
been
interpreted
by
the
commissioner
quite
broadly,
doesn't
mean
necessarily
a
building.
a
library
or
a
chemistry
laboratory
in
a
building,
the
rest
of
the
building,
which
is
committed
and
devoted
to
religious
teaching,
so
long
as
that
library
itself
is
not
used
for
that
purpose,
that
library
can
be
financed.
now,
an
institution
which
admits
only
students
of
a
particular
religion,
requires
them
to
participate
in
religious
activities,
compels
them
to
comply
with
the
doctrines
and
documents
of
the
religion,
forces
them
to
attend
church,
requires
them
under
penalty
of
dismissal
to
take
instruction
in
the
theology
and
doctrines
of
that
religion,
and
does
everything
to
propagate
and
advance
a
particular
religion
other
than
conferred
degrees
in
divinity,
that
such
an
institution
can
constitutionally
receive
governmental
funds
so
long
as,
in
its
bookkeeping,
it
allocates
those
funds
to
the
construction
of
a
chemistry
laboratory
or
a
biology
classroom.
this
is
the
crux
of
the
court's
decision.
i
cannot
see
how
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
forbids
a
religious
test
for
public
office,
nevertheless,
permits
the
financing
of
public
facilities
which
are
barred
to
anybody
but
members
of
a
particular
religion.
this,
yet,
is
what
the
government's
position--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
we
believe
that
such
a
finding
could've
been
made
by
the
court.
among
one
of
these
institutions,
over
95%
of
the
students
are
catholic.
we
do
not
contend
necessarily
that
any
one
of
these
institutions
fits
this
description,
but
we
do
not
concede
that
they
do
not.
we
are
unable
to
draw
conclusions
because
the
court
below
made
no
relevant
finding
of
the
fact.
it
says
all
relevant
--
irrelevant.
we
don't
care
how
many
students
there
are.
we
don't
care
if
the
students
are
required
to
take
theology.
we
don't
care
if
they're
all
catholic.
so
long
as
the
money
is
allocated
to
that
part
of
the
institution
from
which
religion
is
excluded,
this
is,
within
the
purview
of
the
statute,
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
that
at
least
shows
at
least
one
of
the
institutions
has
over
95%
catholic.
it
shows
that
it
advertises
a
primarily
catholic
periodical.
it
asks--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
i
said
that.
i
said--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said
the
court
could
have
so
found
at
least
one
of
them.
it
could
have
so
found.
it
made
no
findings.
it
could've
made
so
found--
had
it
so
found,
i
believe,
such
a
finding
would've
been
supported
by
the
evidence
in
the
record,
but
we
don't
know
what
the
court
found.
the
court
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
and
but,
more
important,
these
four
institutions
are
really
not
the
important
thing
in
this
case.
we
brought
them
in
only
to
create
a
record,
to
provide
specificity
to
use
the
language
in
(inaudible)
of
this
court.
but,
the
commissioner
who
is
the
real
defendant
in
this
case
is
applying
this
law
nationwide.
we're
perfect
in
wanting
to
drop
the
suit
against
these
four
defendants.
we
have
no
desire
to
recoup
any
of
the
money
they've
gotten.
we
are
seeking
an
adjudication
which
will
be
a
guide
to
the
commissioner
of
education
in
carrying
out
the
functions,
duties,
and
obligation
under
this
act.
now,
we
claim
that,
first,
our
argument
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
we
believe
that
the
statute
can
be
reasonably
read
to
limit
it
to
such
institutions
which
are
not
sectarian
in
the
sense
which
we
have
indicated,
in
the
sense
which
has
been
used
in
the
state
courts
in
interpreting
their
own
statutes,
let's
say
there
are
150
years
of
judicial
interpretation
of
the
word
“sectarian.”
we
do
not
contend
and
we've
never
contended
that
merely
because
the
institution
is
church-related
that
it's
disqualified
or
congress
intended
it
to
be
disqualified.
now,
we
think
it
is
reasonable
and,
under
the
well-established
rules,
the
court
should
seek
if
it
really
reads
it
that
way,
it
should
seek
to
interpret
the
statute
according
to
the
context
in
which
i
have
suggested.
certainly,
it's
far
more
acceptable
and
far
more
defensible
or
far
more
acceptable
an
interpretation
than,
for
example,
the
interpretation
of
supreme
being
in
the
seigard
(ph)
case--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed,
it
has
administered
in
the
other
premise.
that's
why
we're
in
court,
or
else
we
wouldn't
be
in
court.
but
leaving
aside
any
further
discussions
of
constitutionality,
how
could
we
just
inextricably
wound
up
with
constitutionality,
we
claim
that
it
is
part
of
the
constitutional
law
of
the
united
states
and
of
all
the
states
in
the
union
that
public
funds
may
not
be
used
to
finance
the
operation
and
construction
of
an
institution,
a
sectarian
institution,
of
a
type
which
we
have
described.
we
believe
that
is
a
principle
which
is
as
--
might
be
said
to
be
part
of
the
common
law
of
the
american
constitutional
system.
it
was
given
its
most,
perhaps,
broadest
pronouncement
in
the
everson
case
in
1947
in
upholding
bus
transportation.
the
everson
case,
a
5:4
split,
was
--
would've
meant
nothing
if
there
were
not
agreement
that
you
could
not
finance
the
operations
of
the
institution
itself.
the
everson
principle
has
been
criticized
because
of
the
term
“no
aid”
is
too
broad
in
this
court,
and
it
also
suggested
that
may
be
too
broad.
the
everson
principle
is
not
a
no-aid
principle.
the
everson
principle
is
no
subsidy
principle,
and
the
court
distinguished
it.
it
distinguished
it
in
walz.
it
distinguished
in
allan,
the
textbook
case,
between
aiding
an
institution
which
the
government
does
many
times
and
subsidizing
it,
financing
it.
that,
what
we
contend,
is
unconstitutional.
now,
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
as
the
government
takes
exemption
to
it,
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
a
precedent
to
this
higher
educational
facilities
act
of
1963,
for
governmental
financing
the
construction
operations
of
a
sectarian
institution.
the
government
says,
ever
since--
in
their
brief,
ever
since
the
moral
act,
the
land
grant
act
of
1962,
the
government
has
financed
church-related
institutions.
we've
said
sectarian
and
gives
us
evidence
for
that,
support,
for
that
assertion
a
study
made
by
the
brazilian
library
of
congress
which
is
reported
in
the
congressional
record,
listing
the
educational
institutions,
church-related
educational
institutions
which
have
received
land
grant
funds.
i
should
like
to,
with
the
brief
list,
i
should
like
to
list--
read
you
the
list
of,
i
think,
less
than
a
dozen
institutions
which
are
cited
in
support
of
this
assertion.
brown
university,
yale
university,
rutgers
university,
dartmouth
university,
university
of
kentucky,
university
of
delaware,
atlanta
university,
maryland
state
college,
auburn
university,
kansas
state
university,
university
of
california.
yes,
university
of
california
and
kansas
state
university.
how
are
these
church-related?
well,
each
one
has
a
little
comment
to
show
how
it's
church-related.
i
will
read
only
one,
kansas
state
university.
to
the
naked
eye,
i
assume
one
would
not
suspect
kansas
state
university
to
be
church-related,
but
this
government
says
it
is.
it
reads
as
follows.
kansas
state
university:
methodist
church
gave
bluemont
central
college
to
state
as
site
for
new
agricultural
college
which
was
to
receive
land
grant
funds.
the
kansas
state
agricultural
college
became
the
state
university.
this
is
the
whole
comment.
ergo,
it
follows
that
the
government
has
given
money
to
a
church
related
college.
i
submit,
your
honors,
if
this
proves
anything,
it
proves
the
opposite
of
what
the
government
decided
for.
it
proves
the
recognition
that
bluemont
college,
so
long
as
it
was
part
of
the
methodist
church,
could
not
receive
government
funds.
so,
what
was
done?
a
gift
that
was
made
to
a
state
university
of
the
state
of
kansas,
the
state
of
kansas
made
a
public
institution
and
it
received
funds.
this
is,
i
submit,
an
argument
which
does
not
stand
strongly
in
this
case.
now,
i
recognize
that
the
everson
decision
is
a
decision
of
this
court
and
what
this
court
gives,
this
court
can
take
away.
and,
if
the
everson
principle
is
dead,
perhaps
this
court
should
say
so.
my
argument
is
that
the
court
has
not
said
so,
that
notwithstanding
the
criticism
and
it
is
legion.
there's
hardly
law
reviews
in
the
country
which
is
said
to
have
from
time
to
time,
now
for
showing
how
broad
the
everson
dictum
is
and
criticizing
for
its
over
breath,
but
the
supreme
judiciary
body
of
the
united
states
is
not
the
law
reviews.
it's
not
the
briefs
of
counsel.
it
is
this
court,
and
i
submit
that
this
court
has
not
in
any
way
impaired
the
integrity
of
the
basic
principle
of
everson
of
no
financing
of
sectarian
institutions.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
conclusion
is
certainly
not
a--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
judgment
said,
and
indeed
this
is
how
everson
has
been
interpreted
every
one
of
the
cases.
this
statute
is
constitutional
because
it
does
not
subsidize
the
operations
of
a
parochial
school.
it
does
not
finance
it.
this
statute
is
constitutional
because
it
cites--
it
provides
welfare
or
safety
benefits.
the
court
said
it
deals
with
just
the
same
as
the
policeman
in
the
corner.
it's
to
protect
the
children
from
the
hazards
of
the
road.
it
does
not.
and
in
allan,
the
textbook
case,
the
court
said
the
same
thing.
this
statute
does
not
subsidize,
does
not
finance
the
operations
of
the
parochial
school.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
could
say
that.
i
wonder
how
it
could
say
it
if
it
says
what--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
could
say
it,
but
respectfully
with
a
good
deal
less
validity.
i
don't
know
how
a
court
can
say
that
financing
a
building,
which
is
part
of
the
institution,
not
financing
an
institution.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
answer
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
everson
was
based
on
the
fact
that
transportation
was
not
their
tool.
the
majority
claims
were
lost.
the
four
justices,
justice
rattles,
mr.
justice
jackson
asserted
that
loss,
but
the
majority
of
the
court
said
it
is
not.
they
said
it's
a
tool
of
public
safety.
it
is
to
protect
the
children
from
getting
run
over.
that's
what
the--
that's
the
premise
of
the
everson
case
and
this
is
how
it's
been
interpreted.
now,
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
overrule
everson,
i
think
it
should
do
so
in
clear
unambiguous
language.
i
should
like
to
quote
to
the
court
a
short
statement
from
the
credos
of
chief
justices.
he
said,
in
united
states
against
burke
(ph),
an
opinion
which
is
to
overrule
all
former
precedents
and
to
establish
a
principle
never
before
recognized
should
be
expressed
in
plain
and
explicit
terms.
a
mere
implication
ought
not
to
prostrate
a
principle
which
seems
to
have
been
so
well
established,
general
expressions
ought
not
to
be
considered
as
overruling
the
settled
principles
without
a
direct
declaration
to
that
effect.
if
this
court
is
prepared
to
correct
a
century-and-a
half
of
error,
i
submit
it
should
do
so
clearly
and
unambiguously.
i
submit
further
that
it
had
not
done
so.
in
no
case
has
this
court
in
any
way
impaired
the
integrity
of
the
basic
principle
of
everson,
no
financing
or
subsidy
of
the
operations
or
constructions
of
a
sectarian
institution
in
the
sense
which
we
are
using
that
term.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
will
–
bradfield,
at
this
particular
point
and
no
point--
no
need
to
respond.
bradfield
against
roberts
was
an
1899
decision
in
which
the
supreme
court
unanimously
upheld
a
contract
between
the
city
of
washington
and
a
corporation
formed
by
an
order
of
nuns
to
operate
the
providence
hospital
in
the
city
of
washington.
the
court
held
the
statute
constitutional
on
two
basic
concepts.
first,
that
there
was
nothing
sectarian
in
the
operation
of
the
hospital.
this
hospital,
as
the
court
said,
is
operated
according
to
its
charter
and
it
is
not
the
hospital
which
operates
--
which
treats
ill
people.
it
does
not
teach,
it
does
not
propagate
religion.
within
the
term
of
“sectarian”
as
we've
used
in
this
case,
it
is
not
a
sectarian
institution.
the
court
indicated
that
as
a
separate
corporation,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
critical
factor.
i
think
the
law
pierces
a
corporate
veil
to
prevent
fraud.
i
think
the
law
would
pierce
a
corporate
veil
to
prevent
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
but
the
critical
factor
is
not
whether
this
is
a
legal
fiction,
a
separate
corporation,
but
whether
this
is
in
truth
and
in
fact
an
institution
which
propagates
and
practice
religion.
it
says
it
does
not
propagate
--
propagates
blessing
and
teaches--
it
teaches
medicine.
secondly,
here's
another
critical
distinction,
the
court
pointed
out
that
no
person
is
denied
admission
and
treatment
to
that
hospital
because
of
the
religion
or
faith.
it
does
not
limit
it
to
the
members
of
that
faith.
it
said,
indeed,
it
had
to
be
because,
as
part
of
its
contract
with
the
city
of
washington,
it
had
to
take
indigent
patients.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
a
state
cannot
make
a
contract
--
a
federal
government
can't
make
a
contract
with
a
sectarian
educational
institution
of
the
type
of
this
kind
whereby
the
state
will
pay
that
institution
money
and
send
its
students
there.
it
can
do
it
with
a
hospital.
but,
the
institution
has
a
right
to
say,
indeed,
it
has
a
constitutional
right
to
say
“under
the
religious
liberty
clause,
we
will
not
admit
anybody
here
unless
he's
part
of
our
faith
and,
indeed,
if
he
is
part
of
our
faith,
as
the
record
shows,
he
must
take
catholic
theology
or
lutheran
theology,
must
go
to
mass
or
to
communion.”
this
is
a
condition
which
a
sectarian
institution
has,
under
the
free
exercise
clause
an
absolute
right
to
make.
that
was
not
followed
in
bradfield
against
roberts.
now,
if
i
am
correct
that,
up
to
the
present,
this
court
has
not
impaired
the
integrity
of
the
basis
of
everson,
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
funds
which
are
allocated
are
earmarked
for
a
particular
facility
which,
of
itself,
is
not
religion.
i--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a
welfare
activity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
was
--
that's
not
all.
in
which
activity
was--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
was
available
to
everybody.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
that's
part
of
the
picture.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
subject
to
certain
other
qualifications,
but
not--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
subject
to
qualifications.
yes,
to
a
non-religious
activity
but
not
one
which
is
limited
to
the
members
of
that
faith
or
which
has
a
religious
bar
or
determination
as
to
who
can
get
the
benefit
of
that
facility.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
would've
if
every
patient
were
required
to
go
to
the
prayer
as
they
are
religious
institutions.
it
would've
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
in
these
institutions,
the
record
shows
that
catholic
--
participation
in
catholic
theology
courses
is
required.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
that
would've
been
enough
to
make
a
difference.
i
don't
think
that--
if
that's
all
there
was,
i
don't
think
that
would
have
bordered
in
to
the
framework
of
a
sectarian
educational
institution
of
the
type
which
i've
discussed.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
nor
that
each
nurse
was
a
nun.
i
think
what's
critical--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
that
was
enough.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
don't
see
what
the
relevance
of
whether
the
church
would've
carried
on
anyway
or
not.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say,
yes.
i--
in
fact,
i
can't
see
what
that--
how
that
makes
the
constitutional--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that,
i
don't--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
not
that
bookkeeping
isn't
very
important.
the
point
of
bookkeeping
is
important
for
this
reason.
the
bookkeeping
is
important
that
it's
not
because
it
saves
the
church's
money,
but
because
--
indeed,
it's
not
important.
i
think
it's
absolutely
not
important,
but
not
for
the
reason
which
you
might
be
suggesting.
it's
not
important
because
the
money
is
used
not
to
save
the
church
money.
now,
the
church
money
may
not
have--
that
might
be
a
case
of
the
church
has
to
go
indeed,
as
a
claim.
they
have
to
go
out
of
business,
unless
they
get
the
federal
funds.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
not--
it
was--
again,
i
must
go
back,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
that,
but
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
to--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
a
subsidy
to
operate
a
public
service
available
to
all
of
the
public
without
any
requirements
of
religion,
without
being
required--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
was
not
the
sub--
i
never
said
the
constitution
forbids
a
subsidy
of
a
religious
institution.
i--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said
of
an
institution
which
is
engaged
in
the
propagation
and
teaching
of
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
hospital
did
not
engage.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
cath--
but,
not
the
hospital.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
exactly,
an
activity
which
is
a
religious
activity.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
teaching
of
mathematics
in
a
building
may
be
a
religious
activity,
it
may
not--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
say
the
government
cannot
subsidize
the
construction
of
a
building
whether
they
called
it
religious
or
not
religious.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
nobody
was
barred
from
entering
that
hospital
because
of
religion,
and
i
cannot
get
away
from
that.
this
is
a
critical
difference.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
it
could
not--
it
should,
but
it
could
not
bar
a
non-member
of
any
particular
religion
because
there
isn't
funding,
and
i
cannot
see
how,
if
the
government
can
do
it
itself,
it
could
subsidize
somebody
else
to
do
what
it's
hoping
to
do.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
indeed,
it
would.
it
will
do
it.
now,
if
you
take,
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
you
take
your
argument
and
carry
it
out--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
mean,
you're--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'm
sorry.
your
suggestion--[laughter]
your
suggestion.
thinking
to
meet
your
question,
suppose
you
have
a
church
which
does
nothing
but
prayer
and
worship,
and
the
government
gives
it
money
to
be
used
only
for
construction
of
new
furnace
room
because
the
furnaces
are
out
of
order
and
the
church
had
no
money.
so,
the
government
gives
it
money
to
construct
the
furnace
room
of
that
church.
is
that
constitutional?
i
don't--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
is
indeed.
the
argument
which
we
make
and
the
case
which
we
make
and
the
court
said
that
even,
by
its
decision,
that
even
so,
if
the
chemistry
laboratory,
if
the
biology
laboratory,
is
there
an
order
to
make
it
possible
for
a
student
to
get
all
of
their
education
under
religious
hospices
which
is
what
the
court
said
in
walz,
then,
this
chemistry
lab
is
just
as
much
part
of
the
whole
religious
unit
as
is
the
room
used
for
teaching
religion
or
for
prayer.
now,
i
must--
in
view
of
the
time,
i
must
go,
if
you'll
permit
me,
to
the
walz
test
which
is
the
latest
voice
of
this
court,
the
latest
statement
of
this
court
on
what
the
establishment
clause
means.
the
walz--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
i'm--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
i
am
not
contending
that
at
all.
i'm
contending
all
tests:
everson,
schempp,
allen,
and
walz.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
are
basically
all
the
same.
they
are
different
formulations
of
what
i've
said
to
be
150
years
of
constitutional
law
of
the
united
states.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
change,
this
court
has
to
make
it.
i
am
not
challenging
the
constitutional
law.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed.
walz
doesn't.
walz
said
and
the
difference
is
that
exemption
applies
no
surveillance,
no
entanglement,
subsidy
does.
and,
entanglement
and
surveillance
here,
there
is
galore.
the
act
provides
that
for
20
years
a
facility
is
used,
if
any
time
in
the
20
years
a
facility
financed
with
federal
funds
is
used
for
sectarian
worship
or
prayer,
the
institution
must
pay
back
to
the
government.
for
20--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
belongs
to
the
institution.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
could.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
at
then
even
and,
presumably
--
i
am
not
saying
that's
constitutional
but,
presumably,
the
government
feels
that
20
years
is
the
life
expectancy
of
the
building.
after
20
years,
it
is
so
depreciated
in
value,
perhaps
you
can
do
anything
you
want.
i
presume
that's
the
rationale,
but
look--
but
if
your
honors
please,
what
is
required
under
this
statute?
the
government
must
keep
an
eye
on
that
institution
for
20
years
unless
religious
teachings
be
bootlegged
in
to
a
humanity
class
because,
if
it
does,
it
violates
the
law.
this
is
surveillance
for
20
years.
moreover,
in
everson,
this
court
ruled
not
only
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
a
public
institution
to
finance
institution
to
teach
the
genesis
version
of
creation,
but
it's
unconstitutional
not
to
teach
the
darwinian
version
of
creation,
of
evolution.
so
that,
this
court
–
united
states
will
have
to
police
these
colleges,
make
sure
not
only
they
do
not
teach
genesis
evolution
or
creation
according
to
genesis,
that
they
must
teach
creation
according
to
darwin.
this
is
surveillance
of
the
most
extreme
kind.
this
is
the
entanglement
of
the
state
and
religion
of
a
type
which
every
decision
of
this
court.
going
back
to
watson
against
jones,
1870,
every
decision
which
the
court
said
that
governments
keep
out,
censoring,
looking
into
the--
what's
happening
in
the
religious
institution.
it's
done
it
in
the
russian
orthodox
cases.
it's
done
that
in
the
catholic
against
connecticut.
it
says
this--
we
are
not
to
go
into
the
insti--
the
ecclesiastical,
theological,
or
religious
institution
and
spy
upon
them
or
oversee
them
or
entangle
ourselves
in
their
activities.
i
cannot
see
how,
under
this
statute,
the
government,
to
be
faithful
to
its
constitutional
obligation,
because
i'm
sure
everybody
can
see
that
the
government
may
not
finance
a
facility
which
is
used
for
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
accord--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
according
to--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
according
to
what
appeared
from
the
government,
the
government
will
be--
will
probably
be
in
better
position
to
answer
this
than
i.
if
they
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
there
may
be
use
of
the
premises
for
religion,
they
inspect
it
and
they
can
and
do
exercise
control
to
make
sure
that
either
that's
discontinued
or
that
appropriate
countermeasures
are
taken.
now,
i
don't
know--
i'm
not
privy
to
how
they
administer
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there's
no
way
of
avoiding
it.
there's
no
avoiding
either
the
constitutional
barrier
or
the
statutory
barrier.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
it
says
you
shall--
the
statute
says
if
this
facility
is
used
in
violation
of
this
provision
as
well
as
other
provisions,
i'm
not
talking
only
about
this
provision,
within
a
20
year
period,
that
the
institution
must
reimburse
the
government
funds.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
know.
i
could
not
answer.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
the
government
would
have
to
answer
that,
but
whether
there
are
or
aren't
i
think
is
not
constitutional.
i
think
if
they
aren't,
it
means
only
that
the
government
is
neglecting
its
constitutional
statutory
obligations.
the
test
is
not
whether
it's
doing
it.
the
test
is
whether
it's
required
by
the
law
and
the
constitution
to
do
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
indeed,
they
are
required
by
law
and
the
constitution
to
uphold
the
statute
out
of
the
constitution.
now,
this
requires
no
other
way,
unless
they
take
the
institutions.
at
least
they
don't
--
at
least
they
don't
if
there's
some
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
under
the
walz
test.
it
is
not
the
only
thing.
there
is
far
more
than
that,
but
this
is
--
it
is
our
contention
that
no
matter
how
you
look
at
this,
how
you
look
at
this
is
unconstitutional.
the
basic
premise
is
a
premise
which
has
only
estops
the
constitutional
law.
these
troubles
which
have
been
had
both
before
this
court
and
the
law
reviews
and
the
law
rights
of
how
to
formulate
that,
but
the
heart
and
blood
of
it
is
that
you
cannot
tax
the
whole
community
to
support
a
religious
enterprise
whose
purpose
is
to
propagate
to
teach
religion
and
it
bars
from
its
facilities
those
who
are
not
of
that
faith.
that,
to
me,
is
basic
constitutional
law
and
i
don't
think
any
test,
however
formulated,
can
get
away
from
a
face
to
face
encounter
with
that
basic
proposition.
now,
one
word
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
didn't
--
that's
not
the
ground.
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
surely.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
absolutely.
i'm
saying
that
that
secular
--
under
the
entanglement
test,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
under
the
entanglement
test
makes
no
difference
because
it
still
requires
surveillance
to
keep
it
that.
you
can't--
unless
you
want
to
overrule--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
unless
the
court
wants
to
overrule
everson,
wants
to
overrule
walz
and,
i
believe,
overrule
howe
too.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
subject
to
the
condition
which
i've
repeated
many
times.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
can't
get
away
from
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because,
otherwise,
the
mere
fact--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
mere
fact--[laughter]
more
than
that--
it's
more
than
that.
i
hope
so.
there
mere
fact
that
the
institution
is
limited
to
the
members
of
the
faith,
as
the
members
of
the
faith
are
required
to
accept
instruction,
which
they
are,
in
that
faith
as
a
condition
to
using
that
facility
which
is
a
case
here.
it
indicates
to
me,
sir,
that
that
facility
is
a
means
now
and
then.
it's
there
in
order
to
make
sure
that
we
get
kids
who
will
take
religion.
they
won't
take--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
what
i
mean.
i
mean,
why
does
an
institution
which
is,
in
this
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
religious,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
its--
anybody
could
go
in
there,
it
is
not
part
of
the
institution.
it's
not
a
means
to
achieve
the
end
of
the
institution.
we
cannot--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
is
not
enough
for--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
is
not
enough
for
me
and
those
facts
are
not
enough
for
me
to
express
an
opinion,
but
i
don't
have
that
here.
i'm
not
required
to
express
an
opinion
there.
that's
not
in
any
of
these
cases.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
would
not
necessarily,
but
if
--
in
order
to
get
into
that
theater
you
had
to
go
first
through
a
chapel
where
you
got
a
sermon
on
the
religion
and
then
you
went
to
the
theater,
i
would
say
we'd
have
an
analogous
case
here.
that's
what
i
would
say
because
that's
exactly
what
the
government
might
say
it
is
perfectly
permissible.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
it
wouldn't
--
i
will
not
say
whether
it
will
be
permissible,
but
i'm
saying
what
conditions
it
would
not
be
permissible.
i
think
--
because,
that,
i
think
is
what's
relevant
here.
we
are
not
required
to
spell
out
for
the
government
what
it
may
do,
we
are
here
to
say
--
to
try
to
convince
the
court
that
what
it
has
done,
it
may
not
do.
it
may
not
say
you
cannot
go
to
the
law
school
unless
you
take
theology,
unless
you
participate
in
mass,
unless
you
are
of
the
catholic
religion
or
lutheran
or--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
then
i
say
a
very
good
case
could
be
made
out
for
saying
that,
as
in
the
maryland
case,
that
the
relationship
of
that
institution
to
the
church
is
reached
a
point
where
it's
no
longer
sectarian.
and,
indeed,
this
is
what's
happening
with
many
with
many
institutions.
it's
what
happened
with
yale,
with
harvard,
with
columbia,
with
princeton.
they
started
out
as
sectarian
institutions.
this
is
what
happened
to
some
catholic
institutions.
they're
going
through
the
same
procedure.
for
them,
georgetown,
notre
dame
--
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
that
in
10
or
15
years
the
relationship
between
notre
dame
and
the
catholic
church
will
be
somewhat
analogous
to
the
relationship
of
columbia
university
and
episcopal
church
or
princeton
and
presbyterian
church,
all
the
institutions.
now,
many
of
the
institutions
are
going
through
the
same
development,
and
they
reach
a
time,
as
the--
as
was
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
held,
when
you
can
say
that
this
is
no
longer
a
sectarian
institution.
the
public
school
system
where
the
united
states
went
through
the
same
metamorphosis,
it
started
out
as
protestant
schools,
as
bible
schools,
and
it
was
against
this
context
that
these
state
constitutions
were
written
--
provided
that
they
cannot
be
supported
because
of
they're
protestant,
not
that
they're
catholic,
they
are
protestant
church
relationship,
church
sectarians,
and
they
use
sectarians.
but,
little
by
little,
through
a
period
of
development
they
became
truly
non-sectarian
institutions,
and
i
say
that
there
are
many
such
institutions
of
higher
education
which
have
a
church
relationship,
but
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
scholarship
to
students
who
could
choose
any
college
they
want
to
go
to?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
to
exercise
my
privilege
of
not
replying
to
a
question
which
i
believe
is
not
relevant
to
this
case
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
the
issue
is
a
difficult
one
and
i
don't
want
to
foreclose
any
possible
position
which
i
could
take
at
a
future
time.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
then
perhaps
if
that's
so,
then
i
would
say,
if
assuming
you
say
that
i
say
it's
constitutional,
i'd
be
grateful
to
have
to,
but
i'm
not
prepared
at
this
point
either
to
make
the
claim
or
to
defend
it.
i'm
not
required
to
in
the
light
of
this
case,
nothing
in
the
court's
opinion
below,
nothing
in
the
position
taken
by
the
government.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
said
that
allen
stressed
that
there
was
no
subsidy
to
the
institution.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
there
was
no
subsidy
there
involved
at
all,
the
use
of
books
were
involved
and
allen,
as
i
interpret
allen--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'd
rather
not
speculate
perhaps
what
allen
would've
decided.
i
would
say
it
did
not
decide
that.
what
i
think
allen
decided
was
this.
that
just
as
a
catholic
child
or
a
lutheran
child
can
go
to
a
public
library
to
borrow
a
book
which
he
needs
to
help
him
in
his
studies,
he
can
in
this
statute
--
under
this
statute,
get
it
from
a
state
directly
without
going
to
the
public
library.
but,
i
do
not
interpret
allen
to
say
that
the
fact,
that
this
book
is
limited
only
to
persons
of
a
particular
religion
would
nevertheless
make
it
constitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
in
connecticut
here's
what
we
did.
we
show
on
the
record
those
who
brought
the
suit,
i
mean
those
who
examined
the
various
institutions
in
connecticut
which
they
could
and
they
chose
--
in
bringing
the
suit,
they
chose
those
which
they
deem
to
be
basically
religious.
they
did
not
choose
others
which
were
not
sectarian
according
to
the
language
we
used,
but
did
have
church-relation.
if
your
honors
please,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i
find
it
necessary
to
correct
a
statement
on
test
made
by
mr.
williams
and
i
do
it
so
because
it
is
critical
to
this
decision.
mr.
williams
said
that
the
statute
requires
the
institutions
to
comply
with
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
forbids
all
form
of
discrimination.
and
mr.
williams
is
in
error,
it
does
not
forbid
all
forms
of
discrimination,
it
does
permit
religious
discrimination.
it
forbids
discrimination
on
race,
color,
or
national
origin
but
it
does
permit,
if
the
word
“religion”
was
deliberately
taken
off,
it
does
permit
religious
discrimination,
it
does
permit
the
use
of
federal
funds
to
finance
an
institution
which
discriminate
religiously.
this
is
critical
to
this
case
because
they
pointed
out
the
difference
between
bradfield,
difference
to
all
these
cases
is
that
this
case
allows
an
institution
to
discriminate
religiously
to
exclude
a
religious
basis.
i
also
want
to
state
and
make
clear
our
position.
we
do
not
concede
any
fact
other
than
the
fact
that
the
institutions
which
are
connecticut
or
all
over
the
united
states
do
make
a
written
commitment
that
in
the
particular
facilities
by
that
they
will
not
teach
or
practice
religion.
we
do
not
agree
with
mr.
williams’
interpretation
of
the
record
below.
we
have
here,
we
prepared
shot
so
our
analysis
of
the
evidence
which
reads
conclusive
directly
contrary
to
mr.
williams,
we
didn’t
bring
them
here
because
there’d
be
no
findings
of
fact,
we
don’t
believe
this
is
a
trial
court.
there
is
--
was
a
great
dispute
in
the
court
below
between
valid
evidences
relevant.
we
contended
the
element
was
relevant
with
that
which
dealt
with
the
time
when
the
grants
to
these
institutions
were
authorized
by
the
government.
most
of
the
testimony
the
evidence
put
forth
by
mr.
williams
why
we
didn’t
cross-examine.
we
objected
to
it.
dealt
with
facts
which
occurred
after,
after
those
grants
were
authorized,
which
occurred
up
to
date
of
trial
and
even
which
have
been
planned
for
future
implementation.
there
were
two
different
institutions
in
each
case.
one
when
the
grant
was
made.
one
when
the
trial
was
conducted.
we
contend
that
the
evidence
which
we
present
as
of
the
time
when
the
grants
were
authorized
did
justify
a
finding
of
fact
that
at
least
one
or
more
of
these
institutions
did
exclude
students
who
were
not
of
the
requisite
phase.
now,
if
the
court
deems
that
to
be
a
critical
fact
as
i
believe
it
is,
i
think
the
court
is
not
a
trial
court.
it
didn’t
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses.
it
should,
i
believe,
remand
it
to
determine
those
facts.
now,
on
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
if
we
did
and
all
i
can
say
mr.
justice
that
for
well
over
a
century
and
a
half.
every
state
in
the
union
bar
not
was
guilty
of
the
violation
of
the
freedom
of
religion
of
thousands
of
thousands
of
people
because
never
before
and
i
repeat
again,
before
this
act
do
we
find
a
situation
where
public
funds
are
used
to
subsidize
an
institution
of
education
institution
limited
to
one
phase.
now,
on
respect
of
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
the
contrary,
i
think
the
whole
constitution
must
be
considered.
i
--
my
argument
is
--
our
confession
is
on
the
contrary
that
the
history
of
the
struggle
for
freedom
of
religion
in
this
country
is
a
large
measure
--
a
history
of
a
struggle
against
compulsory
taxation
for
religious
purposes.
and
it’s
our
contention
on
the
contrary
that
the
tax
make
a
non-catholic
in
order
to
support
an
institution
where
she
is
catholic
probably
took
even
if
it’s
only
to
catholic
students
as
mr.
williams
has
conceded,
even
that
to
me
i
can
sense
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
now,
in
respect
to
the
bradfield
against
roberts,
mr.
williams
has
spoke
of,
i
tried
yesterday
to
distinguish
that
in
the
brief
spent
a
considerable
time
at
but
i
think
the
test
can
be
set
to
be
this
to
distinguish
bradfield
and
other
cases.
the
test
is
whether
the
facility
is
free
standing
or
intergraded
into
the
totality
of
a
curriculum
whereby
the
same
student
is
exposed
to
the
propagation
of
religion
and
the
institution
has
its
major
partners
to
propagate
religion
to
that
student.
what
i
mean
by
this
is
that
if
in
order,
if
the
services
at
the
hospital
are
part
of
a
unit
which
includes
the
inculcation
of
religious
doctrine
and
the
student
and
the
patient
must
take
both
his
treatment
for
his
disease
and
propagation
of
religion,
that’s
unconstitutional.
that
is
a
situation
in
this
case.
no
person
can
walk
off
the
street
and
comment
and
say,
“i
want
to
use
this
chemistry
laboratory
or
in
this
biology
laboratory
or
i
want
to
enroll
only
for
this
one
cause.”
he
is
a
complete
student.
he
must
take
a
whole
works
inc
--
if
he’s
a
catholic
certain.
he
must
take
the
whole
works
including
of
course
in
the
propagation
of
the
catholic
religion.
that,
i
believe
is
the
test.
now
one
word
about
pertinence,
we
are
in
this
court
because
the
congress
is
coordinate
branch
of
government.
this
court
is
of
course
bound
by
the
congress
statement
of
pertinence
--
i
don’t
believe
that’s
true
in
respect
of
states
legislature
but
in
respect
to
congress.
but
it
must
examine
what
the
purpose
is.
mr.
friedman
yesterday
pointed
out
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
purpose
is
to
increase
enrolment
and
the
school
is
not
to
give
additional
facilities
to
anybody
who
wants
those
facilities
but
in
order
to
increase
enrolment
in
those
schools.
and
you
can
do
it
congress
said,
“by
making
these
facilitates
available
so
that
in
the
enrolment
of
students.
i
submit
in
all
deference
that
taking
just
one
of
the
institutions
with
sacred
heart
university
just
an
illustration
which
is
exhibit
in
the
case
its
own
statement
of
what
its
purposes
are.
on
page
16,
it
says,
“convince
of
the
necessity
of
a
catholic
education
at
every
level
for
all
catholic
youth,
the
bishop
who
founded
the
sacred
heart
university
shortly
before
the
opening
of
(inaudible)
to
announce
that
sacred
heart
university
would
be
organized.”
he
said,
“it
is
a
conviction
of
its
founder
and
(inaudible)
major
mission
of
the
church
can
be
carried
on
by
laymen
in
the
catholic
university.
i
submit
if
a
purpose
of
an
institution
is
to
carry
out
the
major
mission
of
the
church
and
funds
are
granted
to
that
institution
in
order
that
it
can
expand
its
enrolment.
i
submit

mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
institution
would
found
in
the
early
60’s.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
1962.
mr.
leo
pfeffer

1962.
shortly
before
vatican
1962.

a
very
new
institution.
thank
you.
