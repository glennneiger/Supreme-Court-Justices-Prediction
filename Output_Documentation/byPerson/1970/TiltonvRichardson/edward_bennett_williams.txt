mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
the
appellants
have
taken
brief
and
argued
this
appeal
as
if
no
evidence
had
been
received
and
no
record
made
in
the
court
below.
in
effect,
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
render
an
advisory
opinion
on
a
hypothetical
caricature
of
what
they
call
a
“sectarian”
institution
of
higher
learning.
twice
in
their
briefs
and
yesterday
during
oral
argument
counsel
said,
“what
the
court
below
has
held
is
that
an
institution
which
admits
only
students
of
a
particular
religion,
requires
them
to
participate
in
religious
activities,
compels
them
to
apply
with
the
doctrines
and
darkness
of
the
religion,
forces
them
to
attend
church
and
does
everything
to
propagate
and
advance
a
particular
religion
other
than
conferred
degrees
in
divinity
can
constitutionally
receive
governmental
funds
so
long
as
in
its
bookkeeping
it
allocates
these
funds
to
the
construction
of
a
chemistry
laboratory
or
gymnasium.”
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
record
will
demonstrate
that
not
a
single
one
of
those
qualifications
is
germane
or
apposite
to
a
single
institution
before
this
court
as
appellee.
nor
do
they
make
that
contention
because
in
the
very
next
sentence
they
say,
“we
do
not
contend
that
any
of
the
four
institutional
defendants
here
in
50
above
composite
description
of
sectarian
educational
institution.”
now,
in
the
court
below,
the
appellees
called
witnesses
to
the
point
of
taxing
the
spirit
of
the
cumulative
evidence
rule
and
of
testing
the
patience
of
a
three-judge
court
to
show
without
contradiction
without
refutation
and
i
say
without
cross-examination
that
first,
the
funded
facilities
of
these
schools
were
never
used,
are
not
being
used
for
any
religious
worship,
for
any
religious
instruction.
they
have
no
symbols
or
artifacts
of
religion
housed
therein.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there's
no
question
mr.
justice
that
they
do
teach
the
history
of
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh!
no
sir,
not
in
these
buildings
but
the
institutions
themselves
first
of
all
do
have
courses
in
religion
but
the
evidence
was
without
contradiction
that
none
of
these
schools
indoctrinate,
propagate,
or
proselytize
the
tenants
of
any
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
may
not
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
do
not
in
fact
do
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
that
would
forbid
them
from
teaching
the
history
but
they
don’t
do
it
nor
have
they
ever
done
it.
but
secondly,
the
evidence
was
without
contradiction
that
these
schools
have
a
completely
open
admissions
policy.
they
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
they
taught
religion
mr.
chief
justice,
or
if
they
worship
in
these
buildings,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
their
contractual
commitment
to
the
government
under
which
they
received
a
small
portion
of
the
cost
of
these
buildings
and
they
would
be
amenable
to
suit
for
the
recovery
of
the
amount
that
the
government
has
contributed.
secondly,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
see
none
mr.
justice.
these
institutions
contract
in
good
faith
that
they
will
not
teach
religion,
that
they
will
not
engage
in
any
form
of
worship
in
these
buildings
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
court
found
that
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted,
unrefuted
by
any
scintilla
of
evidence
that
there
was
no
worship,
that
there
was
no
artifacts
of
religions.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
policing
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it’s
a
negative
commitment
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
the
buildings
were
science
buildings,
a
foreign
language
laboratory,
a
music
art
and
drama
building
and
two
libraries.
the
libraries
were
shown
to
have
completely
open
policies
with
respect
to
books.
the
record
shows
that
each
of
these
institutions
has
adopted
the
american
association
on
university
professors
policy
on
tenure
in
academic
freedom.
that
there
is
no
inhibition
with
respect
to
what
any
teacher
may
teach
within
the
confines
of
his
own
discipline
on
this
campus.
that
there
is
no
required
religious
worship
whatsoever
at
any
of
these
institutions.
that
there
is
no
form
of
indoctrination
at
any
of
these
institutions
and
that
these
institutions
are
funded
by
tuitions,
gifts,
endowments
and
fees
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
is
religious
instruction
at
the
colleges.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
have
four
schools
and
each
of
the
schools
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
each
of
the
schools
offers
courses
in
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
three
of
the
institutions
mr.
justice.
it
is
required
for
catholics
to
take
courses
in
religion.
at
the
fourth
institution,
there
is
a
requirement
that
all
students
take
a
course
in
religion
but
it’s
interesting
to
know
mr.
justice
that
there's
a
stipulation
in
this
case
which
covers
all
of
the
institutions
that
courses
and
religious
studies
cover
a
range
of
human
religious
experiences
and
are
not
limited
to
courses
about
the
roman
catholic
religion.
and
it’s
further
interesting
to
note,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
one
institution
which
requires
religion
in
order
to
matriculate
for
a
liberal
arts
degree
has
a
series
of
courses
which
are
in
all
respects
i
suggest
to
the
court
identical
with
the
courses
being
offered
at
trinity
college
in
hartford,
connecticut
and
at
wesleyan
university
at
hartford,
connecticut
which
appellants
concede
would
be
eligible
for
grants
under
this
act.
and
i
invite
the
court
to
look
at
the
defendant’s
exhibit
sh-2,
which
is
the
sacred
heart
religious
department
wherein
courses
in
theories
of
religion,
problems
of
religion,
modern
jewish
life
and
thought,
american
protestantism,
faith
and
unbelief,
atheism
and
secularism,
search
for
god
in
the
modern
novel
are
courses
that
are
being
taught
by
priests,
by
rabbis,
by
lutheran
ministers
and
by
laymen.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
district
court
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
district
court
mr.
justice
heard
this
evidence
and
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
fills
the
record.
it
does
not
get
into
these
facts
in
its
opinion
or
if
you
will
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
exactly
so
mr.
justice,
it
was
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
suggest
it
is.
appellants
consistently
urged
upon
the
lower
court
that
the
test
should
be
the
nature
of
the
institution
which
was
the
incidental
beneficiary
of
the
grant.
we
consistently
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
test
should
be
what
this
court
has
evolved
in
the
course
of
25
years
from
everson
to
mcgowan,
to
schempp,
to
allen
and
finally
in
epperson.
that
the
test
is
whether
the
statute
has
a
secular
purpose
and
a
primary
effect
that
neither
advances
nor
inhibits
religion
and
of
course
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
not
mr.
justice
for
these
reasons.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
would
not
require
stepping
in
and
it
would
require
a
lot
of
surveillance.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
think
it
does
violence
presumptively
to
expect
that
these
colleges
and
universities
will
deal
with
the
government
in
good
faith.
certainly,
there
would
be
no
incentive
to
conduct
religious
worship
or
sectarian
instruction
in
an
expensive
building
devoted
to
science
filled
with
laboratories
or
in
a
library
when
there
are
other
buildings
which
fully
serve
that
purpose.
but
i
would
like
to
take
mr.
justice,
that
concave
side
of
these
convicts
proposition
and
apply
the
walz
test
is
articulated
by
this
court
to
the
statute
we’re
dealing
with.
in
walz,
there
was
a
caveat.
a
caveat
that
was
supplementary
to
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
as
i
read
that
decision.
the
court
said,
“we
must
look
at
primary
effect
and
notice
whether
or
not
there
is
involved
in
excessive
entanglement
between
state
and
religion,
between
church
and
state.”
now,
here
there
is
the
most
perfunctory
kind
of
surveillance
that
may
take
place
in
the
event
that
a
complaint
is
large
that
there
was
religion
being
conducted
in
one
of
these
buildings.
but
let’s
look
at
the
other
side,
counsel
for
the
appellants
say
and
they
say,
we
give
that
we
concede
that
all
church-related
schools
are
not
barred
from
this
program.
well,
then
what
schools
are
barred?
the
schools
that
are
barred
say
they,
the
theory
of
our
suit
is
that
the
constitution
forbids
support
by
the
federal
government
of
any
institution
which
teaches
or
practices
religion.
again,
they
said
in
the
lower
court,
if
the
institution
teaches
or
practices
religion
as
to
unconstitutional
to
allocated
funds.
in
this
court
they
say,
“we
assert
that
under
the
establishment
clause
an
institution
is
barred
from
receiving
funds,
if
the
propagation
teaching
or
practice
of
religion
is
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
its
existence.”
so,
what
is
the
criterion
that
they
urge?
they
urged
least
throughout
their
briefs
the
harshman
test
promulgated
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
1968.
now,
what
is
the
harshman
test?
it
involves
first
of
all
a
determination
of
the
purpose
of
the
college.
second,
it
involves
an
analysis
of
the
religious
constituency
of
the
governing
board,
the
student
body,
the
faculty
and
the
administrators.
it
involves
a
determination
as
to
where
the
school
gets
its
financial
support
whether
religion.
whether
religion
and
prayer
and
meaningful
and
significant
on
these
campuses.
whether
the
activities
of
the
alumni
are
really
projections
or
extensions
of
the
teachings
of
the
school
and
what
the
image
of
the
school
is
in
the
community.
i
suggest
that
to
apply
that
test,
that
is
being
urged
by
the
appellants
is
the
very
kind
of
entanglement
that
this
court
eschewed
and
shunned
and
avoided
in
relationship
to
the
ad
valorem
real
estate
tax
test
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission
because
it
would
require
a
constant
surveillance
to
determine
the
ever-changing
character
institution
of
817
church-related
colleges
and
universities.
60%
of
the
private
schools
in
america
today
private
higher
educational
institutions
are
church-related.
to
take
the
appellants’
test
would
throw
the
whole
administration
of
the
higher
education
facilities
act
into
chaos
and
confusion.
it
would
cast
doubt
over
the
eligibility
for
grants
of
60%
of
the
private
higher
educational
institutions
in
the
united
states
and
introduce
an
amorphous
test
in
capable
of
application
without
continuous
surveillance
as
these
schools
change
their
character
to
meet
the
test
imposed
by
the
court.
so
i
suggest
as
against
that
mr.
justice,
as
against
that
for
which
they
contend
that
the
kind
of
surveillance
that
is
necessary
to
look
at
a
building
and
seek
whether
or
not
in
the
building
there
is
any
religious
instruction
is
de
minimus.
now,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
think
it’s
unnecessary
to
address
myself
to
that
if
you’re
interested
in
that
mr.
justice.
i
think
this
that
the
kind
of
institution
that
he
has
hypothesized
here
as
the
basis
for
asking
this
court
for
an
advisory
opinion
makes
it
impossible
i
suggest
to
segregate
the
secular
from
the
sectarian
--
the
secular
from
the
religious.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
one
unless
it
be
a
divinity
school
mr.
justice
and
they
have
been
carved
out
of
the
act
specifically.
but
the
kind
of
institution
that
he
hypothesizes
i
know
not
--
i
don’t
know
of
a
single
one
nor
has
one
been
suggested
by
the
appellants
and
i
suggest
that
the
appellants
repeatedly
reminded
the
lower
court
that
they
could
have
brought
this
case
in
anyone
of
50
jurisdictions
and
they
could
have
named
anyone
of
a
number
of
the
institutions
and
that
they
named
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
they
brought
it
in
connecticut.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
violent
presumption
to
suggest
that
they
brought
it
in
a
jurisdiction
which
was
not
evidentially
unfavorable
to
the
cause
which
they
were
asserting.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
isn’t
any
--
mr.
justice,
there
isn’t
any
teacher
on
the
payroll
in
this
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh!
we
have
clergyman
on
the
payroll
across
the
road
here
in
the
congress
and
i
suppose
if
they
are
doing
a
wholly
secular
function
if
it
is
secularly
segregable
so
that
there
can
be
no
game
saying
that
what
they
are
doing
is
purely
secular
that
would
be
possible.
in
bradfield
against
roberts,
we
had
an
institution
owned,
controlled,
and
operated
by
a
monastic
order
of
nuns.
this
was
decided
in
1899
and
a
contract
was
entered
into
between
the
federal
government
and
this
monastic
order
or
nuns
to
erect
an
isolation
ward
at
the
providence
hospital
which
is
still
extent
in
here
in
the
district
of
colombia.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
not
an
education
institution
mr.
justice
but
in
so
far
as
the
focus
is
whether
it
is
sectarian
or
secular,
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
no
difference
between
practicing
medicine
and
teaching
science,
mathematics
or
foreign
language
because
each
is
a
wholly
secular
function
and
that's
what
the
government
was
subsidizing
in
bradfield
v.
roberts
and
my
brother
concedes
that
so
long
as
the
function
is
purely
secular
that
a
contribution
or
a
subsidy
may
be
made
to
a
church
institution.
he
made
that
concession
here
yesterday.
now,
this
function
was
wholly
secular
in
bradfield
v.
roberts
and
the
sole
line
of
distinction
that
counsel
was
able
to
draw
between
bradfield
against
roberts
and
the
case
at
bar
was
that
bradfield
against
roberts
had
an
open
admission’s
policy
suggesting
to
this
court
that
the
institutions
before
the
court
today
do
not
and
i
say
that’s
a
demonstrable
untruth
from
the
record.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
there
couldn’t
be
here
mr.
justice
because
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
are
any
schools
like
that
and
there
can't
be
under
this
statute
because
plaintiffs
exhibit
number
126,
which
is
in
evidence
shows
that
each
of
the
schools
must
affirm
and
must
give
assurance
that
they
are
complying
with
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
inhibits
all
forms
of
discrimination
but
there
is
not
in
this
case
and
there
can't
be.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
government’s
interest
in
the
buildings
mr.
justice,
under
the
statute
exists
for
20
years
and
at
the
end
of
20
years,
there
is
no
further
surveillance.
i
should
say
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they're
free
to
use
them
as
they
choose
mr.
justice.
now,
may
i
respond
to
a
question
that
you
propounded
yesterday.
i
think
you
asked
if
i
recall
correctly
how
much
money
these
institutions
before
the
bar
received
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
they
received
the
total
of
$1,800,000.00
out
of
$18
million
that
were
given
to
institutions
in
the
state
of
connecticut
during
the
same
period
of
time.
now,
i
think
its
significant
mr.
justice
to
recognize
that
in
each
instance
the
university
or
the
college
received
less
than
20%
of
the
cost
of
the
building.
the
maximum
that
they
can
receive
is
33%.
for
example,
the
science
building
at
fairfield
university,
the
record
shows
cost
over
$4
million
the
grant
was
$500,000.00.
a
comparable
figures
are
true
with
respect
to
the
library
and
the
library
at
sacred
heart
university,
a
$24,000.00
grant
was
given
to
albertus
magnus
for
the
foreign
language
laboratory
where
the
students
may
go
to
listen
and
practice
modern
languages.
so,
that
it
is
not
mr.
justice,
as
though
the
government
is
giving
a
building
--
a
whole
building
to
these
schools.
it
is
giving
a
small
percentage
of
the
cost
of
the
buildings
and
the
schools
must
to
commit
to
pay
the
rest.
the
design
being
to
increase
the
academic
facilities
across
the
country
so
that
instead
of
4,200,000
students
having
a
college
education
in
1960,
seven
million
students
are
having
a
college
education
in
the
1970’s
as
projected
by
the
then
president
when
he
proposed
this
legislation.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
their
entirety,
we
would
run
a
foul
of
the
establishment
clause
because
in
that
instance,
they
would
be
launching
an
institution
which
was
teaching
religion
and
if
it
was
subsidizing
the
institution
in
its
entirety
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yale
and
harvard,
i
think
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
it’s
interesting
to
note
mr.
justice
that
yale
today
of
course
has
a
department
of
religion
and
i
think
offers
us
selection
about
as
broad
as
the
institutions
which
were
before
the
bar.
trinity
and
wesleyan
which
were
mentioned
in
the
complaint
filed
by
the
plaintiffs,
i
suggest
to
have
religious
courses
that
are
as
broad
as
the
religious
courses
that
are
offered
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
mr.
chief
justice
we
never
got
in
to
the
area
of
graduate
schools.
our
focus
was
confined
exclusively
to
secondary
schools
offering
academic
degrees
after
high
school.
we
did
not
get
into
medical
schools
and
we
didn’t
get
into
any
other
form
of
graduate
education.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
promulgation
of
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
on
four
occasions,
on
four
occasions
as
that
test
has
evolved
historically
beginning
in
1947
and
rearticulated
again
last
year.
that
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
presumes
that
there
may
be
some
incidental
benefit
to
religion.
it
presumed
it
in
everson.
it
presumed
it
in
mcgowan
against
maryland,
the
sunday
closing
laws.
it
presumed
that
in
board
of
education
against
allen
the
textbook
law
and
of
course
it
presumed
it
in
walz.
again,
this
court
has
said
on
three
occasions
clearly
and
unambiguously
that
the
mandate
of
the
constitution
in
the
establishment
clause
is
not
that
the
government
must
be
hostile
to
religion,
but
that
it
must
be
neutral
as
between
religion
and
irreligion
and
as
among
the
sex
of
religion.
it
said
this
in
everson.
it
said
it
in
zorach
against
clauson,
and
it
said
it
in
abington
against
schempp.
clearly,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
congress
had
gerrymandered
the
church
related
schools
out
of
this
bill
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
teaching
religion
or
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
worship
was
taking
place
on
the
campus
that
it
would
have
manifested
a
constitutionally
inhibited
hostility
to
religion.
now,
again
this
court
has
said
and
it
has
said
three
times
in
applying
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
that
the
focus
in
determining
the
effect,
the
focus
in
determining
the
secularity
of
the
effect
is
not
on
the
nature
of
the
institution
receiving
the
benefit
but
it’s
on
the
function
being
subsidized.
it
said
it
in
everson
and
it
said
it
in
mccollum
against
the
board
of
education
which
struck
down
a
prayer
program
or
a
religious
instruction
program
on
the
premises
of
the
illinois
school
system
because
it
focused
on
the
function
being
subsidized,
not
on
the
nature
of
the
institution.
and
finally,
it
said
in
board
of
education
against
allen
that
it’s
the
function
being
subsidized
that
is
to
determinative
de
facto.
so,
i
suggest
here,
you
have
a
wholly
secular
function
that
is
receiving
a
grant
in
part
for
the
purpose
of
its
erection
and
that
it
clearly
passes
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
say
quite
that
mr.
justice,
but
i
do
say
that
if
there
is
a
piece
of
legislation
which
is
passed
by
the
congress
at
the
instance
of
the
president
for
a
specific
purpose
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
legislation
implements
that
purpose
that
it’s
reasonable
to
say
that
that’s
the
primary
effect
of
the
legislation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
the
purpose
is
secular,
if
the
purpose
is
secular
as
it
was
here,
then
i
suggest
that
if
the
purpose
is
fulfilled
and
implemented
as
it
was
here
because
it
has
been
shown
in
this
record
that
in
fact
the
purpose
was
fulfilled
then
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
primary
effect
notwithstanding
that
there
may
be
some
benefits
flowing
to
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
think
that
it
would
be
relevant
as
to
how
significant
if
you're
talking
about
significance
in
terms
of
monetary
benefit.
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
a
relevant
fact.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
as
long
mr.
justice,
as
there
can
be
a
secularly
segregable
function.
if
it
can
be
secularly
segregable
and
we
have
to
develop
a
record
to
show
whether
it
could
be
or
not,
we
didn’t
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
but
if
it
could
be
a
secularly
segregable
function,
there
is
no
reason
that
the
government
may
not
offer
a
subsidy.
this
court
has
recognized
for
50
years
that
church-related
school
performed
both
a
secular
function
and
at
the
same
time
offer
religious
instruction.
it
recognized
this
in
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters
in
1925,
it
recognized
in
board
of
education
against
allen,
that
these
schools
are
performing
the
function
of
great
social
dimension
to
the
state
of
providing
a
secular
education
--
that
providing
a
secular
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
so
long
as
legislation
can
be
tailored
so
that
the
subsidy
or
the
grant
only
affects
the
secular
facet
of
the
school,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
it
is
not
violated
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh!
the
statute
covers
that
quite
clearly
mr.
justice.
it
says
that
the
facility
to
which
the
contribution
has
been
made
or
for
which
the
contribution
has
made
--
been
made,
may
not
be
used
for
sectarian
worship
or
religious
instruction.
now,
this
would
be
an
entity,
it
would
be
a
facility
as
you
have
hypothesized
the
situation.
therefore,
in
that
law
facility
there
could
be
no
religious
instruction,
there
could
be
no
worship
and
i
suggest
there
could
be
no
symbols
or
artifacts
of
religion
and
indeed
that
is
precisely
what
is
taken
place
in
the
case
at
bar
at
each
of
these
four
institutions.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
participial
phrases
which
form
the
establishment
clause
finally
come
down
to
one
basic
principle
that
the
government
may
not
use
religion
as
a
standard
for
action
or
inaction
that
it
may
not
use
as
a
criterion
to
confer
a
benefit
or
to
impose
a
burden
and
that
this
case
passes
that
test.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
the
appellants
have
taken
brief
and
argued
this
appeal
as
if
no
evidence
had
been
received
and
no
record
made
in
the
court
below.
in
effect,
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
render
an
advisory
opinion
on
a
hypothetical
caricature
of
what
they
call
a
“sectarian”
institution
of
higher
learning.
twice
in
their
briefs
and
yesterday
during
oral
argument
counsel
said,
“what
the
court
below
has
held
is
that
an
institution
which
admits
only
students
of
a
particular
religion,
requires
them
to
participate
in
religious
activities,
compels
them
to
apply
with
the
doctrines
and
darkness
of
the
religion,
forces
them
to
attend
church
and
does
everything
to
propagate
and
advance
a
particular
religion
other
than
conferred
degrees
in
divinity
can
constitutionally
receive
governmental
funds
so
long
as
in
its
bookkeeping
it
allocates
these
funds
to
the
construction
of
a
chemistry
laboratory
or
gymnasium.”
i
say
to
the
court
that
the
record
will
demonstrate
that
not
a
single
one
of
those
qualifications
is
germane
or
apposite
to
a
single
institution
before
this
court
as
appellee.
nor
do
they
make
that
contention
because
in
the
very
next
sentence
they
say,
“we
do
not
contend
that
any
of
the
four
institutional
defendants
here
in
50
above
composite
description
of
sectarian
educational
institution.”
now,
in
the
court
below,
the
appellees
called
witnesses
to
the
point
of
taxing
the
spirit
of
the
cumulative
evidence
rule
and
of
testing
the
patience
of
a
three-judge
court
to
show
without
contradiction
without
refutation
and
i
say
without
cross-examination
that
first,
the
funded
facilities
of
these
schools
were
never
used,
are
not
being
used
for
any
religious
worship,
for
any
religious
instruction.
they
have
no
symbols
or
artifacts
of
religion
housed
therein.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there's
no
question
mr.
justice
that
they
do
teach
the
history
of
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh!
no
sir,
not
in
these
buildings
but
the
institutions
themselves
first
of
all
do
have
courses
in
religion
but
the
evidence
was
without
contradiction
that
none
of
these
schools
indoctrinate,
propagate,
or
proselytize
the
tenants
of
any
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
may
not
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
do
not
in
fact
do
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
that
would
forbid
them
from
teaching
the
history
but
they
don’t
do
it
nor
have
they
ever
done
it.
but
secondly,
the
evidence
was
without
contradiction
that
these
schools
have
a
completely
open
admissions
policy.
they
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
they
taught
religion
mr.
chief
justice,
or
if
they
worship
in
these
buildings,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
their
contractual
commitment
to
the
government
under
which
they
received
a
small
portion
of
the
cost
of
these
buildings
and
they
would
be
amenable
to
suit
for
the
recovery
of
the
amount
that
the
government
has
contributed.
secondly,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
see
none
mr.
justice.
these
institutions
contract
in
good
faith
that
they
will
not
teach
religion,
that
they
will
not
engage
in
any
form
of
worship
in
these
buildings
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
court
found
that
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted,
unrefuted
by
any
scintilla
of
evidence
that
there
was
no
worship,
that
there
was
no
artifacts
of
religions.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
policing
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it’s
a
negative
commitment
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
the
buildings
were
science
buildings,
a
foreign
language
laboratory,
a
music
art
and
drama
building
and
two
libraries.
the
libraries
were
shown
to
have
completely
open
policies
with
respect
to
books.
the
record
shows
that
each
of
these
institutions
has
adopted
the
american
association
on
university
professors
policy
on
tenure
in
academic
freedom.
that
there
is
no
inhibition
with
respect
to
what
any
teacher
may
teach
within
the
confines
of
his
own
discipline
on
this
campus.
that
there
is
no
required
religious
worship
whatsoever
at
any
of
these
institutions.
that
there
is
no
form
of
indoctrination
at
any
of
these
institutions
and
that
these
institutions
are
funded
by
tuitions,
gifts,
endowments
and
fees
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
is
religious
instruction
at
the
colleges.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
have
four
schools
and
each
of
the
schools
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
each
of
the
schools
offers
courses
in
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
three
of
the
institutions
mr.
justice.
it
is
required
for
catholics
to
take
courses
in
religion.
at
the
fourth
institution,
there
is
a
requirement
that
all
students
take
a
course
in
religion
but
it’s
interesting
to
know
mr.
justice
that
there's
a
stipulation
in
this
case
which
covers
all
of
the
institutions
that
courses
and
religious
studies
cover
a
range
of
human
religious
experiences
and
are
not
limited
to
courses
about
the
roman
catholic
religion.
and
it’s
further
interesting
to
note,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
one
institution
which
requires
religion
in
order
to
matriculate
for
a
liberal
arts
degree
has
a
series
of
courses
which
are
in
all
respects
i
suggest
to
the
court
identical
with
the
courses
being
offered
at
trinity
college
in
hartford,
connecticut
and
at
wesleyan
university
at
hartford,
connecticut
which
appellants
concede
would
be
eligible
for
grants
under
this
act.
and
i
invite
the
court
to
look
at
the
defendant’s
exhibit
sh-2,
which
is
the
sacred
heart
religious
department
wherein
courses
in
theories
of
religion,
problems
of
religion,
modern
jewish
life
and
thought,
american
protestantism,
faith
and
unbelief,
atheism
and
secularism,
search
for
god
in
the
modern
novel
are
courses
that
are
being
taught
by
priests,
by
rabbis,
by
lutheran
ministers
and
by
laymen.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
district
court
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
district
court
mr.
justice
heard
this
evidence
and
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
fills
the
record.
it
does
not
get
into
these
facts
in
its
opinion
or
if
you
will
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that’s
exactly
so
mr.
justice,
it
was
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
suggest
it
is.
appellants
consistently
urged
upon
the
lower
court
that
the
test
should
be
the
nature
of
the
institution
which
was
the
incidental
beneficiary
of
the
grant.
we
consistently
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
test
should
be
what
this
court
has
evolved
in
the
course
of
25
years
from
everson
to
mcgowan,
to
schempp,
to
allen
and
finally
in
epperson.
that
the
test
is
whether
the
statute
has
a
secular
purpose
and
a
primary
effect
that
neither
advances
nor
inhibits
religion
and
of
course
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
not
mr.
justice
for
these
reasons.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
would
not
require
stepping
in
and
it
would
require
a
lot
of
surveillance.
first
of
all,
i
don’t
think
it
does
violence
presumptively
to
expect
that
these
colleges
and
universities
will
deal
with
the
government
in
good
faith.
certainly,
there
would
be
no
incentive
to
conduct
religious
worship
or
sectarian
instruction
in
an
expensive
building
devoted
to
science
filled
with
laboratories
or
in
a
library
when
there
are
other
buildings
which
fully
serve
that
purpose.
but
i
would
like
to
take
mr.
justice,
that
concave
side
of
these
convicts
proposition
and
apply
the
walz
test
is
articulated
by
this
court
to
the
statute
we’re
dealing
with.
in
walz,
there
was
a
caveat.
a
caveat
that
was
supplementary
to
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
as
i
read
that
decision.
the
court
said,
“we
must
look
at
primary
effect
and
notice
whether
or
not
there
is
involved
in
excessive
entanglement
between
state
and
religion,
between
church
and
state.”
now,
here
there
is
the
most
perfunctory
kind
of
surveillance
that
may
take
place
in
the
event
that
a
complaint
is
large
that
there
was
religion
being
conducted
in
one
of
these
buildings.
but
let’s
look
at
the
other
side,
counsel
for
the
appellants
say
and
they
say,
we
give
that
we
concede
that
all
church-related
schools
are
not
barred
from
this
program.
well,
then
what
schools
are
barred?
the
schools
that
are
barred
say
they,
the
theory
of
our
suit
is
that
the
constitution
forbids
support
by
the
federal
government
of
any
institution
which
teaches
or
practices
religion.
again,
they
said
in
the
lower
court,
if
the
institution
teaches
or
practices
religion
as
to
unconstitutional
to
allocated
funds.
in
this
court
they
say,
“we
assert
that
under
the
establishment
clause
an
institution
is
barred
from
receiving
funds,
if
the
propagation
teaching
or
practice
of
religion
is
a
meaningful
and
major
part
of
its
existence.”
so,
what
is
the
criterion
that
they
urge?
they
urged
least
throughout
their
briefs
the
harshman
test
promulgated
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
1968.
now,
what
is
the
harshman
test?
it
involves
first
of
all
a
determination
of
the
purpose
of
the
college.
second,
it
involves
an
analysis
of
the
religious
constituency
of
the
governing
board,
the
student
body,
the
faculty
and
the
administrators.
it
involves
a
determination
as
to
where
the
school
gets
its
financial
support
whether
religion.
whether
religion
and
prayer
and
meaningful
and
significant
on
these
campuses.
whether
the
activities
of
the
alumni
are
really
projections
or
extensions
of
the
teachings
of
the
school
and
what
the
image
of
the
school
is
in
the
community.
i
suggest
that
to
apply
that
test,
that
is
being
urged
by
the
appellants
is
the
very
kind
of
entanglement
that
this
court
eschewed
and
shunned
and
avoided
in
relationship
to
the
ad
valorem
real
estate
tax
test
in
walz
against
the
tax
commission
because
it
would
require
a
constant
surveillance
to
determine
the
ever-changing
character
institution
of
817
church-related
colleges
and
universities.
60%
of
the
private
schools
in
america
today
private
higher
educational
institutions
are
church-related.
to
take
the
appellants’
test
would
throw
the
whole
administration
of
the
higher
education
facilities
act
into
chaos
and
confusion.
it
would
cast
doubt
over
the
eligibility
for
grants
of
60%
of
the
private
higher
educational
institutions
in
the
united
states
and
introduce
an
amorphous
test
in
capable
of
application
without
continuous
surveillance
as
these
schools
change
their
character
to
meet
the
test
imposed
by
the
court.
so
i
suggest
as
against
that
mr.
justice,
as
against
that
for
which
they
contend
that
the
kind
of
surveillance
that
is
necessary
to
look
at
a
building
and
seek
whether
or
not
in
the
building
there
is
any
religious
instruction
is
de
minimus.
now,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
think
it’s
unnecessary
to
address
myself
to
that
if
you’re
interested
in
that
mr.
justice.
i
think
this
that
the
kind
of
institution
that
he
has
hypothesized
here
as
the
basis
for
asking
this
court
for
an
advisory
opinion
makes
it
impossible
i
suggest
to
segregate
the
secular
from
the
sectarian
--
the
secular
from
the
religious.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
one
unless
it
be
a
divinity
school
mr.
justice
and
they
have
been
carved
out
of
the
act
specifically.
but
the
kind
of
institution
that
he
hypothesizes
i
know
not
--
i
don’t
know
of
a
single
one
nor
has
one
been
suggested
by
the
appellants
and
i
suggest
that
the
appellants
repeatedly
reminded
the
lower
court
that
they
could
have
brought
this
case
in
anyone
of
50
jurisdictions
and
they
could
have
named
anyone
of
a
number
of
the
institutions
and
that
they
named
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
they
brought
it
in
connecticut.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
violent
presumption
to
suggest
that
they
brought
it
in
a
jurisdiction
which
was
not
evidentially
unfavorable
to
the
cause
which
they
were
asserting.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
isn’t
any
--
mr.
justice,
there
isn’t
any
teacher
on
the
payroll
in
this
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh!
we
have
clergyman
on
the
payroll
across
the
road
here
in
the
congress
and
i
suppose
if
they
are
doing
a
wholly
secular
function
if
it
is
secularly
segregable
so
that
there
can
be
no
game
saying
that
what
they
are
doing
is
purely
secular
that
would
be
possible.
in
bradfield
against
roberts,
we
had
an
institution
owned,
controlled,
and
operated
by
a
monastic
order
of
nuns.
this
was
decided
in
1899
and
a
contract
was
entered
into
between
the
federal
government
and
this
monastic
order
or
nuns
to
erect
an
isolation
ward
at
the
providence
hospital
which
is
still
extent
in
here
in
the
district
of
colombia.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
not
an
education
institution
mr.
justice
but
in
so
far
as
the
focus
is
whether
it
is
sectarian
or
secular,
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
no
difference
between
practicing
medicine
and
teaching
science,
mathematics
or
foreign
language
because
each
is
a
wholly
secular
function
and
that's
what
the
government
was
subsidizing
in
bradfield
v.
roberts
and
my
brother
concedes
that
so
long
as
the
function
is
purely
secular
that
a
contribution
or
a
subsidy
may
be
made
to
a
church
institution.
he
made
that
concession
here
yesterday.
now,
this
function
was
wholly
secular
in
bradfield
v.
roberts
and
the
sole
line
of
distinction
that
counsel
was
able
to
draw
between
bradfield
against
roberts
and
the
case
at
bar
was
that
bradfield
against
roberts
had
an
open
admission’s
policy
suggesting
to
this
court
that
the
institutions
before
the
court
today
do
not
and
i
say
that’s
a
demonstrable
untruth
from
the
record.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
there
couldn’t
be
here
mr.
justice
because
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
are
any
schools
like
that
and
there
can't
be
under
this
statute
because
plaintiffs
exhibit
number
126,
which
is
in
evidence
shows
that
each
of
the
schools
must
affirm
and
must
give
assurance
that
they
are
complying
with
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
inhibits
all
forms
of
discrimination
but
there
is
not
in
this
case
and
there
can't
be.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
government’s
interest
in
the
buildings
mr.
justice,
under
the
statute
exists
for
20
years
and
at
the
end
of
20
years,
there
is
no
further
surveillance.
i
should
say
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they're
free
to
use
them
as
they
choose
mr.
justice.
now,
may
i
respond
to
a
question
that
you
propounded
yesterday.
i
think
you
asked
if
i
recall
correctly
how
much
money
these
institutions
before
the
bar
received
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
they
received
the
total
of
$1,800,000.00
out
of
$18
million
that
were
given
to
institutions
in
the
state
of
connecticut
during
the
same
period
of
time.
now,
i
think
its
significant
mr.
justice
to
recognize
that
in
each
instance
the
university
or
the
college
received
less
than
20%
of
the
cost
of
the
building.
the
maximum
that
they
can
receive
is
33%.
for
example,
the
science
building
at
fairfield
university,
the
record
shows
cost
over
$4
million
the
grant
was
$500,000.00.
a
comparable
figures
are
true
with
respect
to
the
library
and
the
library
at
sacred
heart
university,
a
$24,000.00
grant
was
given
to
albertus
magnus
for
the
foreign
language
laboratory
where
the
students
may
go
to
listen
and
practice
modern
languages.
so,
that
it
is
not
mr.
justice,
as
though
the
government
is
giving
a
building
--
a
whole
building
to
these
schools.
it
is
giving
a
small
percentage
of
the
cost
of
the
buildings
and
the
schools
must
to
commit
to
pay
the
rest.
the
design
being
to
increase
the
academic
facilities
across
the
country
so
that
instead
of
4,200,000
students
having
a
college
education
in
1960,
seven
million
students
are
having
a
college
education
in
the
1970’s
as
projected
by
the
then
president
when
he
proposed
this
legislation.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
their
entirety,
we
would
run
a
foul
of
the
establishment
clause
because
in
that
instance,
they
would
be
launching
an
institution
which
was
teaching
religion
and
if
it
was
subsidizing
the
institution
in
its
entirety
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yale
and
harvard,
i
think
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
it’s
interesting
to
note
mr.
justice
that
yale
today
of
course
has
a
department
of
religion
and
i
think
offers
us
selection
about
as
broad
as
the
institutions
which
were
before
the
bar.
trinity
and
wesleyan
which
were
mentioned
in
the
complaint
filed
by
the
plaintiffs,
i
suggest
to
have
religious
courses
that
are
as
broad
as
the
religious
courses
that
are
offered
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
mr.
chief
justice
we
never
got
in
to
the
area
of
graduate
schools.
our
focus
was
confined
exclusively
to
secondary
schools
offering
academic
degrees
after
high
school.
we
did
not
get
into
medical
schools
and
we
didn’t
get
into
any
other
form
of
graduate
education.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
promulgation
of
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
on
four
occasions,
on
four
occasions
as
that
test
has
evolved
historically
beginning
in
1947
and
rearticulated
again
last
year.
that
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
presumes
that
there
may
be
some
incidental
benefit
to
religion.
it
presumed
it
in
everson.
it
presumed
it
in
mcgowan
against
maryland,
the
sunday
closing
laws.
it
presumed
that
in
board
of
education
against
allen
the
textbook
law
and
of
course
it
presumed
it
in
walz.
again,
this
court
has
said
on
three
occasions
clearly
and
unambiguously
that
the
mandate
of
the
constitution
in
the
establishment
clause
is
not
that
the
government
must
be
hostile
to
religion,
but
that
it
must
be
neutral
as
between
religion
and
irreligion
and
as
among
the
sex
of
religion.
it
said
this
in
everson.
it
said
it
in
zorach
against
clauson,
and
it
said
it
in
abington
against
schempp.
clearly,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
congress
had
gerrymandered
the
church
related
schools
out
of
this
bill
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
teaching
religion
or
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
worship
was
taking
place
on
the
campus
that
it
would
have
manifested
a
constitutionally
inhibited
hostility
to
religion.
now,
again
this
court
has
said
and
it
has
said
three
times
in
applying
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
that
the
focus
in
determining
the
effect,
the
focus
in
determining
the
secularity
of
the
effect
is
not
on
the
nature
of
the
institution
receiving
the
benefit
but
it’s
on
the
function
being
subsidized.
it
said
it
in
everson
and
it
said
it
in
mccollum
against
the
board
of
education
which
struck
down
a
prayer
program
or
a
religious
instruction
program
on
the
premises
of
the
illinois
school
system
because
it
focused
on
the
function
being
subsidized,
not
on
the
nature
of
the
institution.
and
finally,
it
said
in
board
of
education
against
allen
that
it’s
the
function
being
subsidized
that
is
to
determinative
de
facto.
so,
i
suggest
here,
you
have
a
wholly
secular
function
that
is
receiving
a
grant
in
part
for
the
purpose
of
its
erection
and
that
it
clearly
passes
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
say
quite
that
mr.
justice,
but
i
do
say
that
if
there
is
a
piece
of
legislation
which
is
passed
by
the
congress
at
the
instance
of
the
president
for
a
specific
purpose
and
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
legislation
implements
that
purpose
that
it’s
reasonable
to
say
that
that’s
the
primary
effect
of
the
legislation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
the
purpose
is
secular,
if
the
purpose
is
secular
as
it
was
here,
then
i
suggest
that
if
the
purpose
is
fulfilled
and
implemented
as
it
was
here
because
it
has
been
shown
in
this
record
that
in
fact
the
purpose
was
fulfilled
then
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
primary
effect
notwithstanding
that
there
may
be
some
benefits
flowing
to
religion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don’t
think
that
it
would
be
relevant
as
to
how
significant
if
you're
talking
about
significance
in
terms
of
monetary
benefit.
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
a
relevant
fact.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
as
long
mr.
justice,
as
there
can
be
a
secularly
segregable
function.
if
it
can
be
secularly
segregable
and
we
have
to
develop
a
record
to
show
whether
it
could
be
or
not,
we
didn’t
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
but
if
it
could
be
a
secularly
segregable
function,
there
is
no
reason
that
the
government
may
not
offer
a
subsidy.
this
court
has
recognized
for
50
years
that
church-related
school
performed
both
a
secular
function
and
at
the
same
time
offer
religious
instruction.
it
recognized
this
in
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters
in
1925,
it
recognized
in
board
of
education
against
allen,
that
these
schools
are
performing
the
function
of
great
social
dimension
to
the
state
of
providing
a
secular
education
--
that
providing
a
secular
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
so
long
as
legislation
can
be
tailored
so
that
the
subsidy
or
the
grant
only
affects
the
secular
facet
of
the
school,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
it
is
not
violated
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh!
the
statute
covers
that
quite
clearly
mr.
justice.
it
says
that
the
facility
to
which
the
contribution
has
been
made
or
for
which
the
contribution
has
made
--
been
made,
may
not
be
used
for
sectarian
worship
or
religious
instruction.
now,
this
would
be
an
entity,
it
would
be
a
facility
as
you
have
hypothesized
the
situation.
therefore,
in
that
law
facility
there
could
be
no
religious
instruction,
there
could
be
no
worship
and
i
suggest
there
could
be
no
symbols
or
artifacts
of
religion
and
indeed
that
is
precisely
what
is
taken
place
in
the
case
at
bar
at
each
of
these
four
institutions.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
participial
phrases
which
form
the
establishment
clause
finally
come
down
to
one
basic
principle
that
the
government
may
not
use
religion
as
a
standard
for
action
or
inaction
that
it
may
not
use
as
a
criterion
to
confer
a
benefit
or
to
impose
a
burden
and
that
this
case
passes
that
test.
