mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
higher
educational
facilities
act
of
1963
rests
on
findings
by
congress
that,
at
that
time,
there
was
an
urgent
need
for
a
tremendous
expansion
of
the
higher
educational
facilities
in
the
united
states
and,
in
order
to
enable
the
young
people
of
this
country
to
obtain
an
education
which
they
needed
and
which
held
out
great
promise
for
the
future,
the
provision
in
title
i
for
grants
to
educational
institutions
only
permits
grants
upon
a
determination
that
the
grant
will
result
in
the
creation
of
urgently
needed
expansion
of
facilities
which
will
increase
enrollment
of
the
colleges
so
that
the
critical
fact
of
this
statute
is
that
it
was
designed
in
order
to
enable
this
country
to
expand
its
higher
educational
facilities
at
a
time
when
existing
facilities
were
inadequate.
now
the
statute,
as
mr.
pfeffer
has
indicated,
is
very
explicit
that
no
federal
grants
may
be
made
for
any
facility
which
is
used
for
sectarian
instruction
or
sectarian
worship
and
in
addition,
no
grant
may
be
made
for
any
facility
which
is
whole
or
part
of
a
school
of
divinity,
and
school
of
divinity
in
turn,
is
defined
very
broadly.
it's
defined
as
a
school
for
the
education
of
students
to
prepare
them
to
become
ministers
of
religion
or
to
enter
upon
some
other
religious
vocation
or
to
prepare
them
to
teach
theological
subjects.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
tell
--
say
specifically
what
the--
there's
no
policing,
as
we
use
the
term
for--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
statutory
provision
with
that.
the
only
statutory
provision
is
that
academic
facilities
cannot
be
used
for
sectarian
instruction
or
as
a
place
for
religious
worship.
now,
what
the
office
of
education
has
done
in
this
area
is
it
relies
primarily
upon
the
representations
made
by
the
institutions
when
they
seek
a
grant.
they're
required
to
certify
that
none
of
these
facilities
will
be
used
for
religious
purposes.
they're
specifically
instructed
in
several
places
on
the
application
forms
that
this
is
the
limited
purpose.
they
do
have
some
on-site
inspections.
the
on-site--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
this
is
just
under
what
i
might
call
informal
procedures.
they
have
informal
procedures
from
time
to
time
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
regional
offices,
but
they
do
not
have
regional
inspection
procedures.
the
information
they
have
given
me
is
that
since
the
statute
--
since
the
funds
were
received
in
1965,
there'd
been
approximately
3,200
grants.
of
the
3,200
grants,
approximately
half
or
1,600
result
in
facilities
that
have
now
been
completed.
and,
of
the
1,600
completed,
there
have
been
approximately
400
on-site
inspections,
but
the
nature
of
these
facilities,
since
these
are
buildings,
the
nature
of
these
facilities
means
that
the
inspection,
the
kind
of
inspection
is
relatively
simple.
in
other
words,
they
look
to
see
--
look
at
the
catalog
to
see
what
courses
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are,
shown
in
the
record
in
a
stipulation
on
pages
82-84,
three
instances
where
information
came
to
the
attention
of
the
office
of
education
that
three
institutions
apparently
had
been
using
some
of
their
facilities
for
religious
purposes.
in
two
instances,
the
institution
agreed
to
stop
it
and
the
third
instance
where
they
were
using
an
assembly
hall
for
a
chapel,
the
institution
decided
to
return
to
the
federal
government
the
money
it
had
received
from
the
grant.
something
perhaps
it's
self-evident.
the
federal
government
in
these
grants
does
not,
of
course,
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
facility.
it's
only
a
proportionate
amount.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
20
years,
i
think,
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
this
is
a
point
at
which
the
connection
is
so
remote.
one
thing
i
should
say,
however,
that
if
during
the
20-year
period
it
has
discovered
that
an
impermissible
use
is
being
made
of
one
of
these
facilities,
it
does
not
necessarily
automatically
revert
back
to
the
government
and
they
do
not
necessarily
have
to
refund
the
amount.
they
have
the
privilege
of
terminating
the
impermissible
use
which
is
what
happened
in
two
or
three
of
these
hypothetical
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
do
not
terminate
the
use?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
they
are
required
under
the
statute
to
refund
what
they
have
received
from
the
government,
but
it's
on
a
formula
under
which
they
refund
the
relative
value
of
what
they
got
from
the
government
to
the
total
cost
of
the
facility
on
the
basis
of
the
then
value
of
the
facility.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
is
the
statutory
formula.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
--
i
presume
the
government
could
then
either
bring
a
suit
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suppose
this
would
depend
on
what
relief
the
government
seeks.
the
government
building
might
revert
to
the
government.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statute
is
not
explicit
on
that.
the
statute
merely
states
that
if--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
not
clear
on
that,
that's
right,
and
we're
hopeful
that
no
such
cases
will
arise.
this
is,
at
least
as
of
this
time,
there
have
been
no
instances
where
the
government
has
had
to
resort
to
that
except
for
these
three
instances.
now,
let
me
--
since
mr.
pfeffer
has
been
talking
largely
about
what
i
might
call
theoretical
institutions,
let
me
say
that
as
far
as
these
four
colleges
are
concerned,
the
record
in
this
case
is
unequivocal
that
there
has
been
no
prohibited
religious
use
of
any
of
the
facilities
here.
it
was
testified
to
without
any
question
and
the
appellants
here
introduced
no
evidence
that
there
was
no
religious
use
made
of
any
of
these
buildings,
that
there
were
no
religious
plaques,
no
religious
symbols
in
any
of
these
buildings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
evidence
is
very
explicit
on
that
that
they
do
not.
there
was,
again,
un-contradicted
testimony
by
the
heads
of
all
of
these
institutions,
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
made
no
findings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
presumably.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice,
it
would
necessarily
make
any
difference,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
should
consider
on
that
basis
because
even
though
the
district
court
did
not
make
any
findings,
we
have
this
record
and
this
record
is
un-contradicted.
one,
that
they
do
not
discriminate,
that
they
do
permit
members
of
any
faith
to
attend
the
school.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
evidence
is,
again,
un-contradicted
that
no
non-catholic
is
required
to
attend
any
religious
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
catholics,
it
varies,
i
believe.
in
some
of
the
testimony,
it
wasn't.
in
some
of
the
institutions,
they
were
not
required
to
and
some
they
were.
some
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
let
me
--
i'd
like
to
correct
my
answer.
i'm
thinking
back
because
the
testimony
is
by
the
precedence
of
these
colleges
that
the
catholic
students
are
not
required
to
attend
any
religious
services.
they
say
that
catholic
doctrine
may
require
them
in
some
circumstances
to
do
so,
but
that
is
a
matter
for
their
own
conscience.
the
school
does
not--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
there
is--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
again,
mr.
justice,
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
make
any
difference
because,
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute,
under
what
we
think
is
the
appropriate
test,
the
question
is
you
look
to
see
the
facilities
being
subsidized,
are
they
secular?
now,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested,
at
west
point
they
may
have
compulsory
chapel.
there's
litigation
now
pending
in
the
district
of
columbia
over
the
validity
of
compulsory
chapel
at
the
naval
academy,
but
let
me--
if
i
may
say
one--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
other
thing,
mr.
justice
white,
with
respect
to
the
way
these
schools
operate,
the
evidence
is
also
un-contradicted
that
there
are
large
number
of
lay
people
on
the
faculty.
indeed,
the
head
of
the
psychology
department
in
one
of
these
colleges
testified
that
in
the
seven
full
professors
on
his
staff,
four
of
them
were
jewish.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
that
these
courses
are
not
mandatory
for
non-catholic
students.
i
think
that
catholic
students
are
required
in
some
instances
to
take
certain
courses
and
again,
however,
these
courses
are
not
taught
exclusively
by
catholic
teachers.
almost
every
one
of
the
schools,
for
example,
has
a
rabbi
on
the
staff
and,
interestingly
enough,
the
rabbi
is
not
restricted
to
teaching
jewish
theology.
he
is
to
--
in
jewish
religion,
he
teach
--
one
of
the
rabbis
teaches
a
basic
course
in
introductory
survey
of
religion.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
just
briefly
to
refer
to
the
contention
of
appellants
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
these,
doesn't
permit
these
grants.
that
is,
that
the
statute
is
silent
on
the
type
of
institutions
that
may
receive
grants.
all
that
it
speaks
about
is
it
permits
grants
to
institutions
of
higher
education
and,
that,
seems
to
me
a
neutral
thing,
but
the
qualifications
that
the
statute
creates
for
the
receipt
of
these
grants
is
based
on
the
academic
situation
of
the
school,
not
upon
its
religious
affiliation.
however,
the
language
of
the
statue
strongly
suggests
that
congress
recognized
that
grants
would
be
made
to
church-affiliated,
religiously
affiliated
institutions
because
of
the
specific
exception
for
grants
to
divinity
schools.
now,
it's
common
knowledge
that
most
divinity
schools
are
operated
by
religiously
affiliated
institutions
and
when
congress
specifically
accepts
from
the
permissible
category
of
institutions
that
may
receive
these
construction
grants,
divinity
schools,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
very
clear
implication
that
grants
are
permitted
for
non-divinity
school
aspects
of
these
church-related
institutions.
but
if
there's
any
question
about
this,
i
think
it's
completely
dispelled
by
the
legislative
history
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
are--
they
cannot
make.
they
specifically
cannot
make
grants
to
divinity
schools
under
this
statute.
what
i
suggested
is
the
existence
of
that
exception
is
rather
strong
evidence,
we
think,
that
congress
recognized
that
grants
could
be
made
to
non-divinity
school
institutions
that
were
connected
with
religious
organizations.
but,
the
legislative
history
on
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
really
clear
beyond
any
doubt.
first
of
all,
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
testified
during
the
course
of
the
debates
in
congress
that
in
order
to
accomplish
the
necessary
expansion
of
the
educational
facilities,
the
private
non-religiously
affiliated
and
the
public
higher
education
institutions
in
this
country
would
not
be
enough.
they'd
need
to
have
to
call
upon
the
existing
facilities
of
the
religious
institutions,
and
while
it
was
considerable
debate
that
during
the
course
of
this
legislation
over
the
wisdom
and
constitutionality
of
these
grants,
there
was
nobody
who
suggested
that
the
statute
did
not
cover
grants
to
these
institutions.
indeed,
it's
exactly
to
the
opposite
because
several
of
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
explicitly
stated
during
the
course
of
the
debate
that
this
statute
does
cover
religiously
affiliated
institutions
and,
indeed,
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
an
amendment
was
proposed
that
would've
excluded
grants
to
religiously
affiliated
institutions
and
that
amendment
was
defeated
by
a
voice
vote
--
tele
vote
in
both
instances.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
mr.
justice,
there
was
no
implication.
in
all
candor,
i'd
have
to
confess
there
was
perhaps
an
oversight
because
i
think
that
is
a
persuasive
authority
and,
if
i
may,
may
i
cite
another
case
that
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief
which
refers
to
bradford,
and
that
is
a
case
called
quick
bear
v.
leupp,
in
210
u.s.
50,
and
that
was
a
case
which
involved
the
validity
of
grants
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
indian
trust
funds
to
be
used
to
sponsor
and
send
indian
children
to
a
parochial
mission
school
on
an
indian
reservation.
this
was
attacked
on
a
number
of
grounds,
including
the
constitutional
ground.
now,
the
court
disposed
off
the
constitutional
question
in
one
sentence.
citing
the
bradford
case,
the
court
said
it
is
not
contended
that
it
is
unconstitutional
and
it
could
not
be.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
court,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
case
called
quick
bear
v.
leupp
in
210
u.s.
in
1908.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1908,
more
than
60
years
ago.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
let
me
give
--
just
tell,
give
you
some
rough
figures
on
that.
the
record
shows
that
the
total
grants,
since
they
started
making
grants
in
1965,
have
been
about
$1.5
billion.
the
best
estimate
they
give
is
that
roughly
15%
of
those
grants
have
been
to
religiously
affiliated
schools.
another
15%
have
been
to
non-religiously
affiliated
private
schools
and
the
remaining
70%
roughly
have
been
to
public
schools
which
may
include
state
universities,
community
colleges,
technical
colleges.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
across
the
board
and,
indeed,
the
specific
forms
which
they
have
to
fill
out
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
grants,
these
documents,
repeatedly
point
this
out
to
them
and
they
are
required
to
make
these
representations,
along
with
many
others,
with
respect
to
the
way
the
facility
will
be
constructed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
not
in
connection
--
no,
this
bill,
mr.
justice,
was
not
directed
to
that
issue.
this
was
just
directed,
of
course,
to
institutions
of
higher
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
does--
what
it
shows,
mr.
justice,
is
that
the
belief
of
the
congress
that
the
necessary
expansion
of
higher
education
facilities
could
not
be
accomplished
without
the
participation
of
the
religiously
affiliated
institutions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
there
just
wasn't
enough
capacity
available
with
the
existence--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
was
just
the
thing
that
--
it's
one
thing,
i
suggest,
mr.
justice,
to
try
to
create
a
new
institution.
it's
another
to
increase
the
capacity
of
existing
institutions,
and
congress
decided
that
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
problem
facing
american
higher
education
was
to
attempt
to
increase
the
capacity
of
the
existing
institutions
that
already
had
the
experience
in
this
area.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
would
do
one
of
two
things.
we
would,
as
soon
as
we
found
out
about
it,
the
first
thing
we'd
do
is
to
tell
them
to
stop
it,
and
if
they
were
reluctant
to
stop
it
and
refused
to
stop
it,
we
would
then
tell
them
that
they
had
to
refund,
give
us
back
some
money.
and,
i
suppose
if
they,
in
effect,
said
“we
won't
do
either,”
we
would
then
take
whatever
steps
had
to
be
done.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
conceivably
an
eviction
proceeding,
conceivably
a
suggestion
of
some
sort
of
forfeit
--
well,
i
don't
know
if
we
could
forfeit
the
land,
but
certainly
we
could
go
against
him
and
i
suppose
sue
them,
in
effect,
for
breach
of
contract
and
get
us
some
measure
of
damages,
-
whatever
the
amount
was
that
we
had
contributed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
they
would
say
--
presumably
would
say
they
would
not
extend
any
subsidies
to
parents
as
long
as
the
bus
was
being
used
for
that
purpose.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that's
right.
for
example,
the
record
shows,
the
way
they
found
out
about
one
of
these
three
cases
that
i
have
referred
to
is
someone
sending
a
newspaper
clipping
to
the
office
of
education
containing
a
story
on
the
use
of
one
of
these
facilities,
as
apparently
is
a
chapel,
for
holding
religious
exercise.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
it
was
focused
that
specifically.
i
don't
--
i
cannot
be
sure
of
that,
mr.
justice,
because
i
haven't
read,
frankly,
all
of
the
debates
that
are
very
lengthy,
but
the
debates
i
have
read
indicate
that
there
was
a
recognition
of,
as
i
have
indicated,
of
the
fact
that
the
capacity
was
needed
and
that
the
religiously
affiliated
schools
for
a
long
time
had
been
an
essential
portion
of
american
higher
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
can't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that,
but
i
--
what
i
do
suggest
is,
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
quite
clearly
implicit
in
a
congressional
judgment
to
structure
the
statute
this
way.
it
can't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
government?
no,
we
did
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
would
be
happy
to
say
right
now
that
i
think
it
fits
into--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
appellants
relied
very
heavily
on
the
harrisman
(ph)
standard.
we
think
that
the
harriman
standard
applied
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
the
harriman
case
which
was
a
determination
whether
the
institution,
as
an
entity,
was
primarily
sectarian
or
primarily
secular.
we
do
not
think
that
is
the
test
that
this
court
has
consistently
applied
in
dealing
with
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
were
two
things.
you
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
one
of
them
and
you
dismissed
the
appeal
in
the
other.
there
were
two
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
suggest
i'm
talking
about
four
because
i'd
like
to--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
everson,
walz--
we
start
with
the
test
which
is
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
that
test
was
formulated
in
1963
in
schempp.
that
test
was
used
three
times
more.
in
1968,
the
court
applied
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
in
the
allen
case.
in
the
same
year,
it
applied
the
same
test
in
the
everson
case
involving
the
validity
of
the
arkansas
anti-evolution
statute
and
then,
last
year,
in
the
walz
case.
although
it
didn't
quote
the
language
of
that
purpose
and
effect
test,
it
did
use
that
language
and
cited
the
case
at
that
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
and
let
me
say
with
response
to
mr.
pfeffer's
contention
that,
somehow,
everson
is
the
test
and
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
drop
everson
now,
it
should
do
so
explicitly.
in
the
schempp
case,
when
the
court
first
annunciated
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
immediately,
after
quoting
the
language
which
we
rely
on,
it
cited
the
everson
case.
so,
obviously,
the
court
must
have
believed
that
the
purpose
and
effect
test,
it
was
their
announcing
represented
an
application
of
the
somewhat
broader
generalized
principles
that
the
court
announced
in
everson.
now,
the
appellants'
argument,
the
appellants'
attack
on
the
purpose
and
effect
test
rest
almost
exclusively
on
the
notion
that,
somehow,
the
secular
and
the
sectarian
are
so
intertwined
that
any
meaningful
separation
is
impossible.
i
think
the
court
crossed
that
bridge
in
the
allen
case
where
it
rejected
the
notion
that
somehow
you
couldn't
separate
the
secular
and
the
sectarian.
it
recognized
there
that
the
religiously
affiliated
schools
performed
two
distinct
functions,
and
if
it
was
felt
there
that
there
was
no
such
permeation
of
the
two,
such
intermingling
of
the
two,
when
you're
dealing
with
children
in
the
primary
and
elementary
schools
where
they're
far
more
impressionable
than
to
college
students,
certainly
you
cannot
make
that
claim
in
this
context,
where
we
are
dealing
with
students
in
college
and,
indeed,
couple
of
these
universities
have
graduate
schools.
the
purpose
here
is
plainly
secular.
there
can
be
no
question
of
that.
it
was
designed
to
accomplish
an
expansion,
a
desperately
needed
expansion
of
the
facilities
available
for
higher
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
buildings
or
certain
equipment.
for
example--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
for
example,
one
of
the
grants
here
involved
a
foreign
language
laboratory
and
it
also
excludes
certain
types
of
building.
for
example,
the
kid
couldn't
ordinarily
give
a
grant
for
athletic
facilities
unless
this
was
part
of
a
course
in
physical
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
--
not
books,
mr.
justice.
not
books.
it
does
include
libraries
because
two
of
these
grants
are
for
a
library.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
this
means
a
facility
--
this
means,
the
building
in
which
the
books
are
housed.
that's
all
they
give.
these
are
grants
for
facilities,
for
physical
facilities
to
be
used
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
i
would
just
like
to
say
one
last
thing
in
conclusion
because
i
have
to
turn
the
argument
over
to
my
co-counsel
that
the
statute
--
the
test
is
the
primary
effect.
now,
of
course,
this
statute,
these
grants
obviously
do
help
the
church-affiliated
institutions.
they
help
them
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
parochial
schools
were
aided
by
subsidizing
the
parents
for
the
bus
fares
in
everson,
that
they
are
aided
by
paying
for
the
books
in
allen.
but,
the
critical
thing,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
primary
effect
and
the
primary
effect
here
while
it
helps
the
religious
schools
does
not
constitute
a
forbidden
government
intervention,
consider
it
an
actual
government
support
in
furthering
of
religion
as
such.
the
government,
here,
does
maintain
its
neutral
position
toward
religion
and
we
think
that
the
way
this
statute
is
structured,
it
does
permit
room
for
that
benevolent
play
of
the
joints
which
this
court
indicated
last
year
in
walz
as
one
of
the
essential
elements
under
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
higher
educational
facilities
act
of
1963
rests
on
findings
by
congress
that,
at
that
time,
there
was
an
urgent
need
for
a
tremendous
expansion
of
the
higher
educational
facilities
in
the
united
states
and,
in
order
to
enable
the
young
people
of
this
country
to
obtain
an
education
which
they
needed
and
which
held
out
great
promise
for
the
future,
the
provision
in
title
i
for
grants
to
educational
institutions
only
permits
grants
upon
a
determination
that
the
grant
will
result
in
the
creation
of
urgently
needed
expansion
of
facilities
which
will
increase
enrollment
of
the
colleges
so
that
the
critical
fact
of
this
statute
is
that
it
was
designed
in
order
to
enable
this
country
to
expand
its
higher
educational
facilities
at
a
time
when
existing
facilities
were
inadequate.
now
the
statute,
as
mr.
pfeffer
has
indicated,
is
very
explicit
that
no
federal
grants
may
be
made
for
any
facility
which
is
used
for
sectarian
instruction
or
sectarian
worship
and
in
addition,
no
grant
may
be
made
for
any
facility
which
is
whole
or
part
of
a
school
of
divinity,
and
school
of
divinity
in
turn,
is
defined
very
broadly.
it's
defined
as
a
school
for
the
education
of
students
to
prepare
them
to
become
ministers
of
religion
or
to
enter
upon
some
other
religious
vocation
or
to
prepare
them
to
teach
theological
subjects.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
tell
--
say
specifically
what
the--
there's
no
policing,
as
we
use
the
term
for--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
statutory
provision
with
that.
the
only
statutory
provision
is
that
academic
facilities
cannot
be
used
for
sectarian
instruction
or
as
a
place
for
religious
worship.
now,
what
the
office
of
education
has
done
in
this
area
is
it
relies
primarily
upon
the
representations
made
by
the
institutions
when
they
seek
a
grant.
they're
required
to
certify
that
none
of
these
facilities
will
be
used
for
religious
purposes.
they're
specifically
instructed
in
several
places
on
the
application
forms
that
this
is
the
limited
purpose.
they
do
have
some
on-site
inspections.
the
on-site--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
this
is
just
under
what
i
might
call
informal
procedures.
they
have
informal
procedures
from
time
to
time
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
regional
offices,
but
they
do
not
have
regional
inspection
procedures.
the
information
they
have
given
me
is
that
since
the
statute
--
since
the
funds
were
received
in
1965,
there'd
been
approximately
3,200
grants.
of
the
3,200
grants,
approximately
half
or
1,600
result
in
facilities
that
have
now
been
completed.
and,
of
the
1,600
completed,
there
have
been
approximately
400
on-site
inspections,
but
the
nature
of
these
facilities,
since
these
are
buildings,
the
nature
of
these
facilities
means
that
the
inspection,
the
kind
of
inspection
is
relatively
simple.
in
other
words,
they
look
to
see
--
look
at
the
catalog
to
see
what
courses
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are,
shown
in
the
record
in
a
stipulation
on
pages
82-84,
three
instances
where
information
came
to
the
attention
of
the
office
of
education
that
three
institutions
apparently
had
been
using
some
of
their
facilities
for
religious
purposes.
in
two
instances,
the
institution
agreed
to
stop
it
and
the
third
instance
where
they
were
using
an
assembly
hall
for
a
chapel,
the
institution
decided
to
return
to
the
federal
government
the
money
it
had
received
from
the
grant.
something
perhaps
it's
self-evident.
the
federal
government
in
these
grants
does
not,
of
course,
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
facility.
it's
only
a
proportionate
amount.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
20
years,
i
think,
is
a
recognition
by
congress
that
this
is
a
point
at
which
the
connection
is
so
remote.
one
thing
i
should
say,
however,
that
if
during
the
20-year
period
it
has
discovered
that
an
impermissible
use
is
being
made
of
one
of
these
facilities,
it
does
not
necessarily
automatically
revert
back
to
the
government
and
they
do
not
necessarily
have
to
refund
the
amount.
they
have
the
privilege
of
terminating
the
impermissible
use
which
is
what
happened
in
two
or
three
of
these
hypothetical
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
do
not
terminate
the
use?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
they
are
required
under
the
statute
to
refund
what
they
have
received
from
the
government,
but
it's
on
a
formula
under
which
they
refund
the
relative
value
of
what
they
got
from
the
government
to
the
total
cost
of
the
facility
on
the
basis
of
the
then
value
of
the
facility.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
is
the
statutory
formula.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
--
i
presume
the
government
could
then
either
bring
a
suit
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suppose
this
would
depend
on
what
relief
the
government
seeks.
the
government
building
might
revert
to
the
government.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statute
is
not
explicit
on
that.
the
statute
merely
states
that
if--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
not
clear
on
that,
that's
right,
and
we're
hopeful
that
no
such
cases
will
arise.
this
is,
at
least
as
of
this
time,
there
have
been
no
instances
where
the
government
has
had
to
resort
to
that
except
for
these
three
instances.
now,
let
me
--
since
mr.
pfeffer
has
been
talking
largely
about
what
i
might
call
theoretical
institutions,
let
me
say
that
as
far
as
these
four
colleges
are
concerned,
the
record
in
this
case
is
unequivocal
that
there
has
been
no
prohibited
religious
use
of
any
of
the
facilities
here.
it
was
testified
to
without
any
question
and
the
appellants
here
introduced
no
evidence
that
there
was
no
religious
use
made
of
any
of
these
buildings,
that
there
were
no
religious
plaques,
no
religious
symbols
in
any
of
these
buildings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
evidence
is
very
explicit
on
that
that
they
do
not.
there
was,
again,
un-contradicted
testimony
by
the
heads
of
all
of
these
institutions,
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
made
no
findings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
presumably.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice,
it
would
necessarily
make
any
difference,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
should
consider
on
that
basis
because
even
though
the
district
court
did
not
make
any
findings,
we
have
this
record
and
this
record
is
un-contradicted.
one,
that
they
do
not
discriminate,
that
they
do
permit
members
of
any
faith
to
attend
the
school.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
evidence
is,
again,
un-contradicted
that
no
non-catholic
is
required
to
attend
any
religious
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
catholics,
it
varies,
i
believe.
in
some
of
the
testimony,
it
wasn't.
in
some
of
the
institutions,
they
were
not
required
to
and
some
they
were.
some
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
let
me
--
i'd
like
to
correct
my
answer.
i'm
thinking
back
because
the
testimony
is
by
the
precedence
of
these
colleges
that
the
catholic
students
are
not
required
to
attend
any
religious
services.
they
say
that
catholic
doctrine
may
require
them
in
some
circumstances
to
do
so,
but
that
is
a
matter
for
their
own
conscience.
the
school
does
not--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
there
is--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
again,
mr.
justice,
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
make
any
difference
because,
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute,
under
what
we
think
is
the
appropriate
test,
the
question
is
you
look
to
see
the
facilities
being
subsidized,
are
they
secular?
now,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested,
at
west
point
they
may
have
compulsory
chapel.
there's
litigation
now
pending
in
the
district
of
columbia
over
the
validity
of
compulsory
chapel
at
the
naval
academy,
but
let
me--
if
i
may
say
one--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
other
thing,
mr.
justice
white,
with
respect
to
the
way
these
schools
operate,
the
evidence
is
also
un-contradicted
that
there
are
large
number
of
lay
people
on
the
faculty.
indeed,
the
head
of
the
psychology
department
in
one
of
these
colleges
testified
that
in
the
seven
full
professors
on
his
staff,
four
of
them
were
jewish.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
that
these
courses
are
not
mandatory
for
non-catholic
students.
i
think
that
catholic
students
are
required
in
some
instances
to
take
certain
courses
and
again,
however,
these
courses
are
not
taught
exclusively
by
catholic
teachers.
almost
every
one
of
the
schools,
for
example,
has
a
rabbi
on
the
staff
and,
interestingly
enough,
the
rabbi
is
not
restricted
to
teaching
jewish
theology.
he
is
to
--
in
jewish
religion,
he
teach
--
one
of
the
rabbis
teaches
a
basic
course
in
introductory
survey
of
religion.
now,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
just
briefly
to
refer
to
the
contention
of
appellants
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
these,
doesn't
permit
these
grants.
that
is,
that
the
statute
is
silent
on
the
type
of
institutions
that
may
receive
grants.
all
that
it
speaks
about
is
it
permits
grants
to
institutions
of
higher
education
and,
that,
seems
to
me
a
neutral
thing,
but
the
qualifications
that
the
statute
creates
for
the
receipt
of
these
grants
is
based
on
the
academic
situation
of
the
school,
not
upon
its
religious
affiliation.
however,
the
language
of
the
statue
strongly
suggests
that
congress
recognized
that
grants
would
be
made
to
church-affiliated,
religiously
affiliated
institutions
because
of
the
specific
exception
for
grants
to
divinity
schools.
now,
it's
common
knowledge
that
most
divinity
schools
are
operated
by
religiously
affiliated
institutions
and
when
congress
specifically
accepts
from
the
permissible
category
of
institutions
that
may
receive
these
construction
grants,
divinity
schools,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
very
clear
implication
that
grants
are
permitted
for
non-divinity
school
aspects
of
these
church-related
institutions.
but
if
there's
any
question
about
this,
i
think
it's
completely
dispelled
by
the
legislative
history
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
are--
they
cannot
make.
they
specifically
cannot
make
grants
to
divinity
schools
under
this
statute.
what
i
suggested
is
the
existence
of
that
exception
is
rather
strong
evidence,
we
think,
that
congress
recognized
that
grants
could
be
made
to
non-divinity
school
institutions
that
were
connected
with
religious
organizations.
but,
the
legislative
history
on
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
really
clear
beyond
any
doubt.
first
of
all,
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
testified
during
the
course
of
the
debates
in
congress
that
in
order
to
accomplish
the
necessary
expansion
of
the
educational
facilities,
the
private
non-religiously
affiliated
and
the
public
higher
education
institutions
in
this
country
would
not
be
enough.
they'd
need
to
have
to
call
upon
the
existing
facilities
of
the
religious
institutions,
and
while
it
was
considerable
debate
that
during
the
course
of
this
legislation
over
the
wisdom
and
constitutionality
of
these
grants,
there
was
nobody
who
suggested
that
the
statute
did
not
cover
grants
to
these
institutions.
indeed,
it's
exactly
to
the
opposite
because
several
of
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
explicitly
stated
during
the
course
of
the
debate
that
this
statute
does
cover
religiously
affiliated
institutions
and,
indeed,
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate,
an
amendment
was
proposed
that
would've
excluded
grants
to
religiously
affiliated
institutions
and
that
amendment
was
defeated
by
a
voice
vote
--
tele
vote
in
both
instances.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
mr.
justice,
there
was
no
implication.
in
all
candor,
i'd
have
to
confess
there
was
perhaps
an
oversight
because
i
think
that
is
a
persuasive
authority
and,
if
i
may,
may
i
cite
another
case
that
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief
which
refers
to
bradford,
and
that
is
a
case
called
quick
bear
v.
leupp,
in
210
u.s.
50,
and
that
was
a
case
which
involved
the
validity
of
grants
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
indian
trust
funds
to
be
used
to
sponsor
and
send
indian
children
to
a
parochial
mission
school
on
an
indian
reservation.
this
was
attacked
on
a
number
of
grounds,
including
the
constitutional
ground.
now,
the
court
disposed
off
the
constitutional
question
in
one
sentence.
citing
the
bradford
case,
the
court
said
it
is
not
contended
that
it
is
unconstitutional
and
it
could
not
be.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
court,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
case
called
quick
bear
v.
leupp
in
210
u.s.
in
1908.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1908,
more
than
60
years
ago.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
let
me
give
--
just
tell,
give
you
some
rough
figures
on
that.
the
record
shows
that
the
total
grants,
since
they
started
making
grants
in
1965,
have
been
about
$1.5
billion.
the
best
estimate
they
give
is
that
roughly
15%
of
those
grants
have
been
to
religiously
affiliated
schools.
another
15%
have
been
to
non-religiously
affiliated
private
schools
and
the
remaining
70%
roughly
have
been
to
public
schools
which
may
include
state
universities,
community
colleges,
technical
colleges.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
across
the
board
and,
indeed,
the
specific
forms
which
they
have
to
fill
out
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
grants,
these
documents,
repeatedly
point
this
out
to
them
and
they
are
required
to
make
these
representations,
along
with
many
others,
with
respect
to
the
way
the
facility
will
be
constructed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
not
in
connection
--
no,
this
bill,
mr.
justice,
was
not
directed
to
that
issue.
this
was
just
directed,
of
course,
to
institutions
of
higher
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
does--
what
it
shows,
mr.
justice,
is
that
the
belief
of
the
congress
that
the
necessary
expansion
of
higher
education
facilities
could
not
be
accomplished
without
the
participation
of
the
religiously
affiliated
institutions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
there
just
wasn't
enough
capacity
available
with
the
existence--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
was
just
the
thing
that
--
it's
one
thing,
i
suggest,
mr.
justice,
to
try
to
create
a
new
institution.
it's
another
to
increase
the
capacity
of
existing
institutions,
and
congress
decided
that
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
problem
facing
american
higher
education
was
to
attempt
to
increase
the
capacity
of
the
existing
institutions
that
already
had
the
experience
in
this
area.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
would
do
one
of
two
things.
we
would,
as
soon
as
we
found
out
about
it,
the
first
thing
we'd
do
is
to
tell
them
to
stop
it,
and
if
they
were
reluctant
to
stop
it
and
refused
to
stop
it,
we
would
then
tell
them
that
they
had
to
refund,
give
us
back
some
money.
and,
i
suppose
if
they,
in
effect,
said
“we
won't
do
either,”
we
would
then
take
whatever
steps
had
to
be
done.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
conceivably
an
eviction
proceeding,
conceivably
a
suggestion
of
some
sort
of
forfeit
--
well,
i
don't
know
if
we
could
forfeit
the
land,
but
certainly
we
could
go
against
him
and
i
suppose
sue
them,
in
effect,
for
breach
of
contract
and
get
us
some
measure
of
damages,
-
whatever
the
amount
was
that
we
had
contributed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
they
would
say
--
presumably
would
say
they
would
not
extend
any
subsidies
to
parents
as
long
as
the
bus
was
being
used
for
that
purpose.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that's
right.
for
example,
the
record
shows,
the
way
they
found
out
about
one
of
these
three
cases
that
i
have
referred
to
is
someone
sending
a
newspaper
clipping
to
the
office
of
education
containing
a
story
on
the
use
of
one
of
these
facilities,
as
apparently
is
a
chapel,
for
holding
religious
exercise.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
it
was
focused
that
specifically.
i
don't
--
i
cannot
be
sure
of
that,
mr.
justice,
because
i
haven't
read,
frankly,
all
of
the
debates
that
are
very
lengthy,
but
the
debates
i
have
read
indicate
that
there
was
a
recognition
of,
as
i
have
indicated,
of
the
fact
that
the
capacity
was
needed
and
that
the
religiously
affiliated
schools
for
a
long
time
had
been
an
essential
portion
of
american
higher
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
can't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that,
but
i
--
what
i
do
suggest
is,
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
quite
clearly
implicit
in
a
congressional
judgment
to
structure
the
statute
this
way.
it
can't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
government?
no,
we
did
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
would
be
happy
to
say
right
now
that
i
think
it
fits
into--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
appellants
relied
very
heavily
on
the
harrisman
(ph)
standard.
we
think
that
the
harriman
standard
applied
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
the
harriman
case
which
was
a
determination
whether
the
institution,
as
an
entity,
was
primarily
sectarian
or
primarily
secular.
we
do
not
think
that
is
the
test
that
this
court
has
consistently
applied
in
dealing
with
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
were
two
things.
you
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
one
of
them
and
you
dismissed
the
appeal
in
the
other.
there
were
two
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
suggest
i'm
talking
about
four
because
i'd
like
to--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
everson,
walz--
we
start
with
the
test
which
is
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test.
that
test
was
formulated
in
1963
in
schempp.
that
test
was
used
three
times
more.
in
1968,
the
court
applied
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
in
the
allen
case.
in
the
same
year,
it
applied
the
same
test
in
the
everson
case
involving
the
validity
of
the
arkansas
anti-evolution
statute
and
then,
last
year,
in
the
walz
case.
although
it
didn't
quote
the
language
of
that
purpose
and
effect
test,
it
did
use
that
language
and
cited
the
case
at
that
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
and
let
me
say
with
response
to
mr.
pfeffer's
contention
that,
somehow,
everson
is
the
test
and
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
drop
everson
now,
it
should
do
so
explicitly.
in
the
schempp
case,
when
the
court
first
annunciated
the
purpose
and
primary
effect
test
immediately,
after
quoting
the
language
which
we
rely
on,
it
cited
the
everson
case.
so,
obviously,
the
court
must
have
believed
that
the
purpose
and
effect
test,
it
was
their
announcing
represented
an
application
of
the
somewhat
broader
generalized
principles
that
the
court
announced
in
everson.
now,
the
appellants'
argument,
the
appellants'
attack
on
the
purpose
and
effect
test
rest
almost
exclusively
on
the
notion
that,
somehow,
the
secular
and
the
sectarian
are
so
intertwined
that
any
meaningful
separation
is
impossible.
i
think
the
court
crossed
that
bridge
in
the
allen
case
where
it
rejected
the
notion
that
somehow
you
couldn't
separate
the
secular
and
the
sectarian.
it
recognized
there
that
the
religiously
affiliated
schools
performed
two
distinct
functions,
and
if
it
was
felt
there
that
there
was
no
such
permeation
of
the
two,
such
intermingling
of
the
two,
when
you're
dealing
with
children
in
the
primary
and
elementary
schools
where
they're
far
more
impressionable
than
to
college
students,
certainly
you
cannot
make
that
claim
in
this
context,
where
we
are
dealing
with
students
in
college
and,
indeed,
couple
of
these
universities
have
graduate
schools.
the
purpose
here
is
plainly
secular.
there
can
be
no
question
of
that.
it
was
designed
to
accomplish
an
expansion,
a
desperately
needed
expansion
of
the
facilities
available
for
higher
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
buildings
or
certain
equipment.
for
example--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
for
example,
one
of
the
grants
here
involved
a
foreign
language
laboratory
and
it
also
excludes
certain
types
of
building.
for
example,
the
kid
couldn't
ordinarily
give
a
grant
for
athletic
facilities
unless
this
was
part
of
a
course
in
physical
education.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
--
not
books,
mr.
justice.
not
books.
it
does
include
libraries
because
two
of
these
grants
are
for
a
library.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
this
means
a
facility
--
this
means,
the
building
in
which
the
books
are
housed.
that's
all
they
give.
these
are
grants
for
facilities,
for
physical
facilities
to
be
used
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
i
would
just
like
to
say
one
last
thing
in
conclusion
because
i
have
to
turn
the
argument
over
to
my
co-counsel
that
the
statute
--
the
test
is
the
primary
effect.
now,
of
course,
this
statute,
these
grants
obviously
do
help
the
church-affiliated
institutions.
they
help
them
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
parochial
schools
were
aided
by
subsidizing
the
parents
for
the
bus
fares
in
everson,
that
they
are
aided
by
paying
for
the
books
in
allen.
but,
the
critical
thing,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
primary
effect
and
the
primary
effect
here
while
it
helps
the
religious
schools
does
not
constitute
a
forbidden
government
intervention,
consider
it
an
actual
government
support
in
furthering
of
religion
as
such.
the
government,
here,
does
maintain
its
neutral
position
toward
religion
and
we
think
that
the
way
this
statute
is
structured,
it
does
permit
room
for
that
benevolent
play
of
the
joints
which
this
court
indicated
last
year
in
walz
as
one
of
the
essential
elements
under
the
establishment
clause.
