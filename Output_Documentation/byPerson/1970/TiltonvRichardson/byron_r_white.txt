justice
byron
r.
white
it's
actually
been
administered
on
the
other
premise
on
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
say
about
the
conclusion
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
court
couldn't
say
the
same
thing
in
these
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
say
so
in
allan
and
if
it
could
say
so
in
everson,
perhaps
it
could
say
so
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pfeffer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
from
your
discussion
in
bradfield,
although
the--
since
you
say
the
separate
corporation
was
not
very
important
in
the
case,
that
the
government
may
give
money
to
a
church,
a
religious
organization,
to
carry
on
a
non-religious
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
non-religious
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
they
did
in
bradfield.
they
gave
money
to
the
church
to
carry
on
a
hospital,
in
which
hospital
there
were
no
religious
activities.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
mr.
pfeffer,
but
nevertheless
the
government
may
give
money
to
a
church
to
carry
on
non-religious
activities.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
so
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
have
made
any
difference
in
bradfield
if
there
had
been
a
place
for
prayer
and
worship
in
the
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
fundamentally,
i
take
it,
you
just
take
issue
with
the
notion
from
the
ground
up
that
there's
more
than
one
activity
going
on
in
a
sectarian
school
that
everything
that
goes
on
in
it
is
sectarian--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
secular
education
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
it's
inextricably
intermingled
with
a
secular?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
irrelevant
that
some
schools,
you
would
classify
as
sectarian
under
your
definition,
if
some
school
undertakes
to
live
up
to
the
conditions
of
the
grant,
that
you
must
nevertheless
disregard
the
conditions
in
order
to
say
it's
unconstitutional
for
them
to
agree
to
those
conditions.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
you
can
subsidize
a
church,
give
money
to
a
church
to
carry
on
an
activity
which
activity
itself
is
not
aimed
at
propagating
the
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
up
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
up
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
in
these
--
what
does
the
evidence
show
about
whether
these
institutions
limit
their
students
to
one
with
the
legislation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
before
anything--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
curriculum?
do
they
include
the
courses
in
religious
instruction
in
which
it's
mandatory
for
students
to
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
participate
in
the
harrisman
(ph)
case
in
maryland?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
say
something
about
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
cited
only
once,
i
guess.
it
was
cited
as
a
comparative
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
we
dismiss
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
those
institutions
--
in
an
institution
of
that
kind,
if
there
are
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
did
know
mr.
williams,
suppose
there
was
a
condition
for
matriculation
that
you’d
be
a
catholic?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
couldn’t
be
but
then
you
don’t
suppose
and
you
suggest
that
it’s
just
really
an
academic
question
that
it
maybe
that
schools
--
there
are
any
schools
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happened
to
these
buildings
to
be
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
free
to
use
these
buildings
and
for
religious
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
suggest
that
the
only
test
that
primary
effect
is
whether
the
government
achieves
its
secular
purpose
and
that
it’s
irrelevant
what
consequences
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
wholly
aside
from
how
much
or
how
important
or
how
significant
an
aid
to
the
religious
activities
may
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
regardless
how
much
significant
that
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
apparently
suggest
also
that
the
establishment
clause
is
so
rigid
that
a
legislature
may
not
take
notice
of
free
exercise
values
in
terms
of
a
problem
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
policy
institution
founded,
mr.
pfeffer?
justice
byron

when
was
the
institution
founded
by

1660?
