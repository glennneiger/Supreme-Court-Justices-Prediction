justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it’s
clear
that
if
he
--
when
on
an
automobile
accident
that
cut
his
leg
off,
so
would
that
under
the
regulation
you
and
the
government
would
agree
would
there
be
a
circumstance
beyond
his
control
that
would
clearly
affect
his
status
on
the
selective
service,
but
that
if
he
enrolled
as
a
bonafide
student
and
as
an
undergraduate
and
a
bonafide
at
college,
after
receiving
an
induction
notice
that
would
clearly
be
something
within
his
control
and
would
not
justify
reopening,
you
would
both
be
agreed
on
those
two
appointed
position
according
to
the
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is
here
whether
a
status
of
conscientious
objection
which
my
hypothesis
crystallized
or
occurred
after
the
induction
notice
falls
under
the
one
category
or
the
other,
is
that
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
congress
said
about
divinity
students
for
instance?
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
saying
about
a
person
who
enrolled
in
a
divinity
school,
after
receiving
his
induction
notice
and
the
regulation
as
it
is
written
would
not
allow
him
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
have
control
although
a
divinity
student
as
i
thought
was
expressly
exempted
by
congress
from
being
inducted.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
that
there’s
a
good
deal
of
difference
of
view
between
you
and
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
forum
for
this
man.
i
understood
you
to
say
there’s
no
forum
whatsoever
if
you
don’t
prevail
in
this
case
and
i
understand
it
from
the
government’s
brief
that
they
concede
and
tell
us,
advise
us
that
his
forum
would
be
after
induction
when
he
asserts
his
claim
of
his
conscientious
objector
in
the
army,
that
the
army
has
basically
the
same
standards
as
does
the
selective
service
law
with
respect
to
conscientious
objectors?
justice
potter
stewart
have
i
misunderstood
the
government’s
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
with
regards
to
statute
doesn’t
protect
those
who
cannot
submit
to
induction,
maybe
the
constitution
does
but
the
statute
talks
about
service
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
induction?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
what’s
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
would
the
congress
write
--
it
didn’t
say
that
they’re
exempted
from
being
inducted,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
inducted?
does
it
say
so?
you’re
talking
about
the
words
that’s
not
in
here.
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
he
immediately
files
a
conscientious
objector
application,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
a
(inaudible)
but
the
--
even
if
his
objection
had
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
my
point
is
that
congress
doesn’t
protect
the
conscientious
objector
from
being
inducted?
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
words?
justice
potter
stewart
the
word
that
the
congress
used.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
hadn’t
communicated
with
his
selective
service
board
at
all
until
he
got
to
the
induction?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
induction
center
an
army
establishment
or
is
in
a
selective
service
establishment?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
run
by
the
united
states
army?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
on
the
other
hand,
you
concede
that
a
bonafide
undergraduate
college
student
could
not
get
a
reopening,
if
he
went
to
college
after
his
induction
notice,
don’t
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you’re
talking
--
you
just
told
us
that
the
conscientious
objectors
are
the
only
ones
except
for
military
service
who
were
treated
this
way.
certainly,
the
college
student
who
goes
to
college
after
his
induction
notice
is
treated
this
way.
justice
potter
stewart
but
here
the
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
drafted
by
his
conscience
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
by
the
almighty
or
whatever.
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
circuit
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
quite
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
how
has
the
selective
service
system
as
to
regulations
bring
the
ambiguity?
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
there’s
no
question
as
to
its
ambiguity?
justice
potter
stewart
splits
the
circuit
intramurally
split
between
circuits
you
read
either
way?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
it
made,
the
sentences
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
depends
really.
i
think
on
whether
you
accept
the
proposition
that
a
conscientious
objector
whose
objection
crystallized
or
post
induction
of
it
is
somebody
who
comes
under
the
regulation.
if
he
is,
if
he
is
then
you
treat
him
differently
from
the
way
you
do
the
man
who
was
hit
by
an
automobile
had
his
leg
cut
off.
if
on
the
other
hand,
you
don’t
accept
the
fact
that
he
comes
under
the
definition
then
you’re
quite
right
that
you
treat
him
no
different
from
the
way
you
treat
a
man
who
goes
to
divinity
school
after
his
--
after
his
notice
of
induction
was
sent.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rehnquist,
you
don’t
necessary
do
it
now
at
all
but
i
hope
that
you
will
before
you
finish
your
argument,
state
as
clearly
as
you
can
if
you
can
the
government’s
position
with
respect
to
assuming
the
bonafides
on
this
conscientious
objector
status
just
where
and
when
can
he
assert
the
claim
and
how
would
it
be
processed?
i
don’t
mean
in
your
own
order
but
i
hope
you
will
explain.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
before
any
combatant
training
or
service?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
waiver
i
suppose
and
after
all
you
can
even
--
you
can
waive
even
constitutional
rights?
i
suppose
that
could
be
misunderstood
in
terms
of
waiver,
you
had
an
objection
but
you
didn’t
make
it?
justice
potter
stewart
one
other
thing
mr.
rehnquist
to
go
back
when
i
asked
you
about
the
forum
available
to
men
situated
as
this
petitioner
is
and
you
told
us
about
the
army
practice.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
should
have
a
communication
from
the
army
within
the
last
10
days
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
if
unless
that’s
confidential
or
for
some
other
reason,
could
you
make
that
available.
justice
potter
stewart
same
criteria,
same
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
welsh
against
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
if
the
--
if
the
board
has
refused
to
consider
his
claim
on
the
ground
that
has
late
matured
and
has
now
passed
beyond
their
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
ought
to
be
able
to
present
it
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
not
talking
about
him.
i’m
talking
about
the
late
maturing
delay
in
that.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
mr.
rehnquist.
mr.
halvonik,
you
have
about
seven
minutes
left.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
way
mr.
halvonik,
you’ll
have
an
opportunity
to
submit
any
response
in
the
way
of
commentary
on
the
material
that
mr.
rehnquist
presented.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
i
gather
the
government
isn’t
now
claiming
that
a
gentleman
who
doesn’t
present
his
claim
because
it
matured
late
isn’t
going
to
get
his
claim
heard.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
while
we’re
talking
about
footnotes,
i
have
a
question
about
footnote
53
in
your
brief.
i
was
puzzled
and
rather
intrigued
to
find
that
despite
the
decision
in
this
very
case
of
your
client
william
ward
ehlert,
you
tell
us
that
state
headquarters
of
the
selective
service
system
at
sacramento
california
has
what
you
describe
as
a
procedure
for
having
conscientious
objections
claims
in
the
manner
urged
by
you
and
footnote
53
on
page
28,
is
there
an
explanation
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
which
memorandum?
this
memorandum
came
--
was
promulgated
well
after
the
decision
in
this
case
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
any
explanation
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
puzzled
me
very
much
and
i
just
wondered
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
california
selective
service
apparently
state
wise
is
doing
exactly
what
you
say
a
selective
service
ought
to
do
and
it's
doing
it
despite
the
decision
of
this
case
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
this
california
law
that
i
knew
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
not
in
oral
argument
that
i’ve
heard
but
in
its
brief
urges
this
of
course
that
the
conviction
can
be
and
should
be
affirmed
even
if
we
accept
your
procedural
theory,
your
procedural
and
constitutional
theory
on
the
basis
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it’s
clear
that
if
he
--
when
on
an
automobile
accident
that
cut
his
leg
off,

that

a
question
about
footnote
53
in
your
brief.
i
was
puzzled
and
rather
intrigued
to
find
that
despite
the
decision
in
this
very
case
of
your
client
william
ward
ehlert,
you
tell
us
that
state
headquarters
of
the
selective
service
system
at
sacramento
california
has
what
you
describe
as
a
procedure
for
having
conscientious
objections
claims
in
the
manner
urged
by
you
and
footnote
53
on
page
28,
is
there
an
explanation
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
which
memorandum?
this
memorandum
came
--
was
promulgated
well
after
the
decision
in
this
case
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
any
explanation
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
puzzled
me
very
much
and
i
just
wondered
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
california
selective
service
apparently
state
wise
is
doing
exactly
what
you
say
a
selective
service
ought
to
do
and
it's
doing
it
despite
the
decision
of
this
case
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
this
california
law
that
i
knew
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
not
in
oral
argument
that
i’ve
heard
but
in
its
brief
urges
this
of
course
that
the
conviction
can
be
and
should
be
affirmed
even
if
we
accept
your
procedural
theory,
your
procedural
and
constitutional
theory
on
the
basis
