what
we’re
arguing
about
here
then
is
whether
there
can
--
whether
the
government
may
validly
under
the
statute
force
a
change
of
venue
or
a
change
of
forum
for
the
hearing
of
the
conscientious
objector
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there’s
no
claim
that
the
forum
--
there’s
any
difference
between
the
forum,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
in
terms
of
fairness
or
anything
like
that,
it’s
just
a
question
of
whether
you
have
to
inducted
before
you
get
your
claim
heard?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
you
prevailed
in
this
case,
the
remaining
issues
and
let’s
go
back
on
remand
as
to
the
validity
of
this
claim
both
with
respect
to
late
maturation,
sincerity,
and
etcetera.
justice
byron
r.

wouldn’t
decide
any
of
those
questions,
i’m
very
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
