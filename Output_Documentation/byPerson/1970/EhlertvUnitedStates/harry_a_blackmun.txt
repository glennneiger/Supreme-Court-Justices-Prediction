mr.
halvonik,
i
would
like
to
join
mr.
justice
harlan’s
remark,
do
try
to
keep
your
voice
up,
it’s
hard
to
hear
you
over
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
rehnquist,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
to
what
extent
do
you
rely
on
the
so
called
department
of
defense
directive?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
know,
perhaps
you
can
straighten
me
out
as
to
the
dod
directive.
the
first
sentence
speaks
of
federal
courts
upheld
that
a
claim
to
exception
must
be
interposed
prior
to
notice
of
induction
and
failure
to
make
timely
claim
constitutes
a
waiver,
this
i
take
it
is
the
government’s
position
here.
now,
the
second
sentence
seems
to
me
to
be
internally
inconsistent.
it
says
a
request
for
discharge
after
entering
military
service
base
solely
on
conscientious
objection
which
existed
but
was
not
claimed
not
prior
to
notice
but
prior
to
induction.
is
it
internally
inconsistent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
certainly,
it
doesn’t
say
that,
does
it?
