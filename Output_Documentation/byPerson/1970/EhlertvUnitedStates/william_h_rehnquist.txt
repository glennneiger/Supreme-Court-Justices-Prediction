mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
advert
very
briefly
to
the
facts
as
they
appear
to
the
government
to
bear
on
the
appropriate
decision
of
this
case.
on
july
24,
1961,
the
petitioner
registered
for
the
draft
because
he
reached
age
18.
on
january
17,
1964,
the
petitioner
returned
his
classification
questionnaire
to
the
local
board
making
no
assertion
of
claim
to
conscientious
objection.
on
april
15,
1964,
petitioner
was
ordered
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
on
may
26,
1964.
in
june
16,
1965,
the
petitioner’s
induction
notice
was
mailed
to
him
directing
him
to
report
for
induction
on
july
14,
1965.
one
day
before
the
date
scheduled
for
his
induction,
on
july
13,
1965,
the
petitioner
mailed
a
letter
to
his
local
draft
board
asserting
that
he
was
a
conscientious
objector.
the
petitioner
was
tried
for
violation
of
the
applicable
statute
convicted
by
the
district
court
and
the
judgment
was
upheld
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
split
of
eight
to
five
in
that
court.
the
questions
raised
by
the
petitioner
go
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
regulation
whether
the
regulation
as
interpreted
by
the
court
below
was
consistent
with
the
statute.
the
regulation
as
is
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
the
critical
language
is
that
reclassification
after
mailing
of
induction
notice
is
cut
off
in
all
cases
unless
it
is
based
on
a
claim
of
“change
in
the
registrant’s
status
resulting
from
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
has
no
control,
and
the
regulation
as
construed
by
the
court
below
is
designed
to
exclude
all
post
notice
of
induction
claims
subject
only
to
a
very
narrow
exception
and
the
exception
is
--
requires
two
facets,
one
must
meet
both
facets
to
come
within
the
exception.
the
first
is
that
it
be
a
non-volitional
change
and
the
second
is
that
it
be
a
change
resulting
from
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
had
no
control.
now,
there
were
two
opinion,
three
opinions
in
the
court
below
agreeing
with
the
result
of
affirmance
of
the
conviction.
judge
kilkenny
writing
the
court’s
majority
opinion
stressed
the
volitional
nature
of
a
change
in
conscientious
belief.
judge
donahue
with
the
concurrence
of
three
of
the
other
judges
of
the
panel
who
also
concurred
with
judge
kilkenny
stressed
the
common
sense
in
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
circumstances
in
the
context
used
in
the
regulation
concluding
that
as
used
the
term
referred
to
some
event
external
or
extraneous
to
the
registrant
and
therefore
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
engage
in
the
debate
that
had
gone
on
between
the
other
circuits
which
had
considered
this
matter
as
to
whether
a
change
in
conscience
was
volitional
or
not
since
regardless
of
that,
such
a
change
was
not
a
circumstance
as
used
in
those
regulations.
both
judge
kilkenny
and
judge
donahue
relied
also
on
the
serious
practical
consequences
of
a
contrary
construction
as
expounded
by
judge
merrill
for
the
dissenters
in
reaching
the
result
that
they
did.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can’t
answer
that
your
honor.
there’s
no
doubt
that
this
thing
is
something
that
can
reasonably
argued
either
way.
i
think
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can’t
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
know
that
the
selective
service
system
is
presently
in
the
process
of
a
complete
overhaul
of
its
regulations
and
hopefully
this
type
of
thing
will
be
ultimately
eliminated
and
i
think
also
that
you
know,
not
just
in
this
situation
but
in
others,
something
that
when
you
write
it
appears
perfectly
clear,
you
get
a
particular
fact
situation
to
apply
it
to
and
all
of
a
sudden
there’s
an
ambiguity
you
didn’t
notice
there
when
you
were
writing.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
gearey
was,
the
first
gearey
case
was
364
f.2d
which
would
place
it
i
suppose
four
or
five
years
ago.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
was
back
in
the
50s
i
think.
but
i
think
--
i
believe
gearey
was
the
first
case
that
went
the
other
way
though
i’m
not
positive
about
that.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
think
it’s
an
important
factor
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
we
have
not
only
set
forth
the
dod
regulation,
we
have
checked
within
the
past
week
with
the
office
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
army
and
received
his
assurance
that
this
type
of
claim
that
was
not
considered
on
the
merits
by
the
selective
service
system
is
considered
when
raised
under
the
army
system
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
if
read
literally,
i
suppose
it
is.
i
think
taken
in
context
with
the
first
sentence,
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
focus
is
notice
of
induction
rather
than
induction
and
that’s
the
interpretation
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
army
places
on.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn’t
say
it
in
so
many
words,
no.
as
you
commented
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
cutting
of
a
claim
for
a
purely
voluntary
reason,
the
case
of
a
teacher
who
becomes
a
teacher
after
notice
for
induction.
now,
that’s
been
upheld
by
the
third
circuit
this
past
year
in
case
called
clark
versus
volatile
which
is
the
same
case
that
in
september
went
the
same
way
as
the
second
circuit
had
gone
in
gearey.
so
to
say
as
petitioner
does
that
we
treat
conscientious
objectors
in
some
invidious
way
that
we
don’t
treat
any
other
kind
of
claims
for
a
change
in
registration
just
isn’t
so.
in
fact,
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
certainly
if
we
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
treat
him
contrary
to
the
way
the
regulation
says
we
should
treat
him,
you
don’t
need
any
further
argument,
i
suppose,
to
conclude
that
we’re
doing
wrong
by
it
but
we
say
the
regulation
construed
perfectly
consistently
with
its
language
does
cut
off
not
just
conscientious
claims
but
any
claim
that
maybe
result
from
volition
and
of
course
before
notice
to
report
for
induction,
there
are
any
number
of
things
that
one
may
do
volitionally
to
obtain
exemption.
one
may
go
to
school,
one
may
enter
the
ministry,
one
may
become
a
teacher,
these
are
barred
and
there
has
been
no
suggestion
in
any
court
that’s
considered
the
point
that
they
may
not
be
barred
post
induction
notice.
so,
the
unifying
theme
of
the
regulation
is
the
notion
that
not
only
is
volitional
move
to
obtain
exemption
totally
cut
off
with
the
mailing
of
the
induction
notice
but
that
only
those
non-volitional
types
of
claims
which
are
capable
of
ready
verification
by
the
local
board
consisting
as
it
does
of
laymen
meeting
irregularly.
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption,
a
brother
shot
down
in
a
plane
of
something
like
that
that
can
be
verified
with
a
letter
or
a
phone
call
is
something
that
can
clearly
be
disposed
off
by
the
board
one
way
or
the
other
between
the
time
of
notice
of
induction
and
the
time
of
reporting
for
induction
which
is
near
as
i
can
tell
from
these
cases
seems
to
have
run
during
this
period
of
time
of
--
from
between
three
and
four
weeks.
a
claim
to
a
change
in
ones
conscience,
a
change
in
conscientious
status
requiring
as
it
does
both
the
ascertainment
of
a
present
state
of
mind
and
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
is
a
change
of
the
state
of
mind
one
held
prior
to
induction
is
a
factual
and
of
extraordinary
difficulty
and
even
had
this
petitioner
mailed
his
claim
the
day
after
he
received
his
induction
notice,
a
local
board
would
have
had
great
difficulty
passing
on
it,
prior
to
the
time
of
induction
deciding
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
certainly
when
he
mails
it
on
the
day
before
he
is
scheduled
to
report
for
induction,
he
assures
the
absolute
impossibility
of
the
board
being
able
to
pass
on
it.
in
short,
he
assures
himself
regardless
of
the
merits
of
his
claim,
regardless
of
the
merits
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim
or
of
his
claim
to
a
change
of
mind
of
getting
a
postponement
in
the
date
set
for
induction.
and
in
effect,
somebody
else
who
had
a
higher
lottery
number
who
is
not
being
called
that
month
is
put
into
the
manpower
pool
to
replace
him
while
his
case
remains
in
limbo
for
some
un-ascertainable
period
of
time
while
the
local
board
makes
the
determination
if
you
follow
the
gearey
procedure
and
we’re
to
adopt
gearey
as
to
whether
in
fact
there
has
been
a
change
of
status
or
not.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well,
let
me
address
it
right
now
if
i
may.
the
dod
directive
which
we
cite
and
the
assurances
we
have
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
army
as
of
this
past
week
are
that
a
registrant
whose
claim
is
not
passed
upon
on
its
merits
because
--
it
arises
post
induction
notice
isn’t
passed
on
by
under
merits
by
the
selective
service
board
maybe
offered
and
considered
under
the
army
regulations
as
soon
as
the
registrant
is
inducted.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
my
understanding
is
that
as
soon
as
that
kind
of
a
claim
is
made
in
the
army,
the
man
gets
what
is
in
effect
a
desk
job
in
a
situation
where
he
is
not
further
processed
into
the
military
system
until
there
has
been
a
disposition
one
way
or
the
other
of
his
claim.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
prevails
he
gets
discharged.
the
petitioner
claims
that
since
under
his
view
of
the
statute,
it
confers
a
right
of
exemption
on
the
conscientious
objector
and
doesn’t
expressly
authorize
any
regulation
which
may
limit
the
time
in
which
that
claim
can
be
asserted,
that
the
regulation
is
here
applied
by
the
court
below
as
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
therefore
unauthorized.
i
think
this
claim
proves
too
much
and
would
cite
at
least
two
points
in
support
of
that
observation.
there
is
no
expressed
statutory
authority
in
6
(j)
for
barring
the
assertion
of
conscientious
objector
claims
which
have
existed
previous
to
induction
notice
but
haven’t
been
asserted
and
yet
even
the
court’s
which
have
gone
the
gearey
route
have
said
that
this
is
a
proper
function
of
the
regulation
that
the
man
who
was
always
a
conscientious
objector
but
fails
to
assert
it
until
the
time
he
receives
the
induction
notice
can
validly
be
barred
and
yet
there’s
no
statutory
authority
for
that.
it’s
simply
the
application
of
a
procedural
rule
that
is
fairly
designed
to
both
permit
reasonable
processing
of
these
claims
and
to
effectuate
a
necessary
ultimate
cut
off
date
and
change
it.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
his
waiver
is
so
significantly
different
from
a
procedural
cut
off,
neither
of
them
are
expressly
authorized
by
statute,
both
of
them
are
well
recognized
in
almost
any
system
of
procedural
adjudication.
perhaps
waiver
because
it
is
--
you
know,
something
that
every
lawyer
responds
to
almost
instinctively
with
an
affirmative
notion,
maybe
waiver
is
different
but
i
don’t
think
it
that
--
it’s
completely
different
and
i
think
the
type
of
procedural
thing
we’re
talking
about
here
is
by
no
means
completely
distinguishable.
the
same
section
6
(j)
of
the
act
that
confers
the
right
of
conscientious
objector
exemption
also
confers
in
unqualified
terms
a
right
of
appeal
and
although
this
precise
language
is
this,
“any
person
claiming
exemption
from
combatant
training
and
service
because
of
such
conscientious
objection
shall
if
such
claim
is
not
sustained
by
the
local
board,
be
entitled
to
an
appeal
to
the
appropriate
appeal
board”,
and
yet
i
suspect
even
petitioner
wouldn’t
contend
that
the
president
under
his
general
authority
to
promulgate
rules
isn’t
entitled
to
set
some
time
limit
as
within
which
an
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
a
local
board
must
be
taken
to
the
appeal
board.
surely,
on
the
day
before
you
need
to
report
for
the
induction,
you
can’t
come
in
and
say,
“well,
i’ve
decided
to
appeal
to
the
appeal
board
from
the
local
board’s
adverse
ruling
two
years
ago,
that
i
wasn’t
a
conscientious
objector.”
so,
it
simply
is
an
overly
simplistic
to
use
an
overly
used
word.
construction
of
the
statute
to
say
that
because
it
confers
a
right
of
conscientious
objection,
there
may
be
no
procedural
regulations
governing
how
that
right
is
to
be
set
forth
or
how
it
is
to
be
processed,
and
as
occurred
earlier
in
the
colloquy
between
counsel
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
you
parse
the
sections
sentence
by
sentence,
the
only
unqualified
right
conferred,
even
if
you
take
a
literal
reading
is
the
right
to
be
exempt
from
combatant
training
and
service.
the
right
to
be
exempt
from
induction
is
conferred
only
upon
those
who
are
found
by
their
local
boards
to
be
conscientious
objectors.
i
don’t
think
you
can
read
either
one
of
those
statutes’
sense
as
literally
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others.
i
think
that
the
overall
result
that
you
get
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
section
is
that
there
is
a
substantive
right
of
conscientious
objection
and
that
reasonable
rules
are
permissible
so
long
as
they
serve
a
legitimate
and
to
the
selective
service
system
and
its
administration
and
don’t
unreasonably
restrict
the
right
of
the
conscientious
objector
claimant
to
assert
his
claim
in
that
forum.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
are
and
i
regret
to
say
that
the
selective
service
system
in
past
years
not
only
may
have
been
guilty
of
writing
ambiguous
regulations.
it
has
been
guilty
of
not
keeping
as
much
statistical
information
as
it
should.
what
we
have
is
figures
for
august,
september,
october
and
november
of
1970
and
this
is
the
first
time
selective
service
nationally
began
keeping
these
figures.
during
this
four
month
period,
there
was
a
total
manpower
call
of
42,000.
during
the
same
four
month
period,
the
total
number
of
registrants
who
asserted
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims
was
2695.
in
other
words,
the
very
statement
of
petitioner
in
his
brief
that
the
service
will
be
easily
able
to
adjust
to
this
insignificant
insubstantial
burden
is
squarely
at
odds
with
these
facts.
6.42%
of
the
total
manpower
call
in
the
last
four
months
is
asserting
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
not
just
conscientious
objector
claims
but
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims
and
if
you
take
the
states
with
large
metropolitan
jurisdictions,
the
facts
are
even
more
startling.
california
which
leads
the
nation
had
a
draft
call
during
this
period
of
time
of
4191
total
men
called
into
service.
during
that
period,
in
california,
490
persons
asserted
post
notice
conscientious
objection
claims.
if
you
take
the
10
states
with
the
highest
rate
of
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims,
the
average
rate
of
those
claims
is
11.22%
of
the
total
men
called
to
the
service
in
those
states.
now,
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
black,
i
apologies
to
say
we
didn’t
even
have
this
figures
at
the
time
we
wrote
the
brief.
the
brief
was
submitted
the
first
of
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
california
had
the
most,
new
york
next,
michigan,
massachusetts,
washington,
connecticut,
colorado,
oregon,
rhode
island
and
the
district
of
colombia
in
that
order.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
we
would
be
happy
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
prepare
perhaps
a
more
detailed
summary
of
the
figures
that
i
have
given
here
orally
and
file
them
with
the
court
as
soon
as
possible.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
isn’t
confidential
mr.
justice
stewart
and
we
will
see
to
it
with
the
court’s
permission
that
we
incorporate
that
in
the
same
submission
in
which
we
incorporate
the
statistics.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
my
understanding
mr.
justice
white
is
that
as
soon
as
the
claim
is
presented,
the
man
is
given
what
is
generally
foretold
as
a
desk
job
or
a
headquarters
type
job,
so
that
he
will
be
available
in
the
area
of
the
either
army
center
or
in
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
the
training
is
as
i
understand
it
is
differed
completely
until
the
mans
claim
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
the
affording
of
the
army
forum
rather
than
the
local
board
forum
under
the
circumstances
presented
here
is
consistent
with
the
statute
and
regulation.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
of
no
such
claim.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
far
as
i
know
that
that’s
the
only
difference.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
it’s
a
military
forum,
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
the
issues
are
the
same
and
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
i
know,
it’s
the
same
criteria
and
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
same
as
far
as
i
know
from
reading
their
most
recent
directive
that
they
are
well
aware
of
welsh
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
there
--
i
can’t
give
a
real
accurate
answer,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
it’s
a
series
of
interviews
and
then
there’s
an
army
board
which
evaluates
the
material
gained
and
in
effect
holds
a
hearing.
i’m
not
as
confident
as
i
should
be
in
the
correctness
of
that
response.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
be
happy
too,
if
i
might
submit
that
along
with
the
other
two
management
mr.
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
he’d
have
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedy.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i’ve
been
going
in
the
assumption
that
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
say
make
sense
to
me
but
i
haven’t
examined
that
branch
of
the
law
and
don’t
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
look
at
the
man
who
does
not,
who
is
a
conscientious
objector
in
1964
gets
an
induction
notice
in
1965,
has
never
had
his
--
has
never
presented
his
claim.
now,
the
local
board
won’t
hear
his
claim.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
i
have
--
i’m
not
at
all
sure
that
when
he’s
inducted,
he
can
necessarily
resort
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
should
think
that
he
could
resort
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
advert
very
briefly
to
the
facts
as
they
appear
to
the
government
to
bear
on
the
appropriate
decision
of
this
case.
on
july
24,
1961,
the
petitioner
registered
for
the
draft
because
he
reached
age
18.
on
january
17,
1964,
the
petitioner
returned
his
classification
questionnaire
to
the
local
board
making
no
assertion
of
claim
to
conscientious
objection.
on
april
15,
1964,
petitioner
was
ordered
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
on
may
26,
1964.
in
june
16,
1965,
the
petitioner’s
induction
notice
was
mailed
to
him
directing
him
to
report
for
induction
on
july
14,
1965.
one
day
before
the
date
scheduled
for
his
induction,
on
july
13,
1965,
the
petitioner
mailed
a
letter
to
his
local
draft
board
asserting
that
he
was
a
conscientious
objector.
the
petitioner
was
tried
for
violation
of
the
applicable
statute
convicted
by
the
district
court
and
the
judgment
was
upheld
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
split
of
eight
to
five
in
that
court.
the
questions
raised
by
the
petitioner
go
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
regulation
whether
the
regulation
as
interpreted
by
the
court
below
was
consistent
with
the
statute.
the
regulation
as
is
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
the
critical
language
is
that
reclassification
after
mailing
of
induction
notice
is
cut
off
in
all
cases
unless
it
is
based
on
a
claim
of
“change
in
the
registrant’s
status
resulting
from
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
has
no
control,
and
the
regulation
as
construed
by
the
court
below
is
designed
to
exclude
all
post
notice
of
induction
claims
subject
only
to
a
very
narrow
exception
and
the
exception
is
--
requires
two
facets,
one
must
meet
both
facets
to
come
within
the
exception.
the
first
is
that
it
be
a
non-volitional
change
and
the
second
is
that
it
be
a
change
resulting
from
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
had
no
control.
now,
there
were
two
opinion,
three
opinions
in
the
court
below
agreeing
with
the
result
of
affirmance
of
the
conviction.
judge
kilkenny
writing
the
court’s
majority
opinion
stressed
the
volitional
nature
of
a
change
in
conscientious
belief.
judge
donahue
with
the
concurrence
of
three
of
the
other
judges
of
the
panel
who
also
concurred
with
judge
kilkenny
stressed
the
common
sense
in
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
circumstances
in
the
context
used
in
the
regulation
concluding
that
as
used
the
term
referred
to
some
event
external
or
extraneous
to
the
registrant
and
therefore
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
engage
in
the
debate
that
had
gone
on
between
the
other
circuits
which
had
considered
this
matter
as
to
whether
a
change
in
conscience
was
volitional
or
not
since
regardless
of
that,
such
a
change
was
not
a
circumstance
as
used
in
those
regulations.
both
judge
kilkenny
and
judge
donahue
relied
also
on
the
serious
practical
consequences
of
a
contrary
construction
as
expounded
by
judge
merrill
for
the
dissenters
in
reaching
the
result
that
they
did.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can’t
answer
that
your
honor.
there’s
no
doubt
that
this
thing
is
something
that
can
reasonably
argued
either
way.
i
think
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can’t
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
know
that
the
selective
service
system
is
presently
in
the
process
of
a
complete
overhaul
of
its
regulations
and
hopefully
this
type
of
thing
will
be
ultimately
eliminated
and
i
think
also
that
you
know,
not
just
in
this
situation
but
in
others,
something
that
when
you
write
it
appears
perfectly
clear,
you
get
a
particular
fact
situation
to
apply
it
to
and
all
of
a
sudden
there’s
an
ambiguity
you
didn’t
notice
there
when
you
were
writing.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
gearey
was,
the
first
gearey
case
was
364
f.2d
which
would
place
it
i
suppose
four
or
five
years
ago.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
was
back
in
the
50s
i
think.
but
i
think
--
i
believe
gearey
was
the
first
case
that
went
the
other
way
though
i’m
not
positive
about
that.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
think
it’s
an
important
factor
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
we
have
not
only
set
forth
the
dod
regulation,
we
have
checked
within
the
past
week
with
the
office
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
army
and
received
his
assurance
that
this
type
of
claim
that
was
not
considered
on
the
merits
by
the
selective
service
system
is
considered
when
raised
under
the
army
system
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
if
read
literally,
i
suppose
it
is.
i
think
taken
in
context
with
the
first
sentence,
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
focus
is
notice
of
induction
rather
than
induction
and
that’s
the
interpretation
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
army
places
on.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn’t
say
it
in
so
many
words,
no.
as
you
commented
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
cutting
of
a
claim
for
a
purely
voluntary
reason,
the
case
of
a
teacher
who
becomes
a
teacher
after
notice
for
induction.
now,
that’s
been
upheld
by
the
third
circuit
this
past
year
in
case
called
clark
versus
volatile
which
is
the
same
case
that
in
september
went
the
same
way
as
the
second
circuit
had
gone
in
gearey.
so
to
say
as
petitioner
does
that
we
treat
conscientious
objectors
in
some
invidious
way
that
we
don’t
treat
any
other
kind
of
claims
for
a
change
in
registration
just
isn’t
so.
in
fact,
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
certainly
if
we
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
treat
him
contrary
to
the
way
the
regulation
says
we
should
treat
him,
you
don’t
need
any
further
argument,
i
suppose,
to
conclude
that
we’re
doing
wrong
by
it
but
we
say
the
regulation
construed
perfectly
consistently
with
its
language
does
cut
off
not
just
conscientious
claims
but
any
claim
that
maybe
result
from
volition
and
of
course
before
notice
to
report
for
induction,
there
are
any
number
of
things
that
one
may
do
volitionally
to
obtain
exemption.
one
may
go
to
school,
one
may
enter
the
ministry,
one
may
become
a
teacher,
these
are
barred
and
there
has
been
no
suggestion
in
any
court
that’s
considered
the
point
that
they
may
not
be
barred
post
induction
notice.
so,
the
unifying
theme
of
the
regulation
is
the
notion
that
not
only
is
volitional
move
to
obtain
exemption
totally
cut
off
with
the
mailing
of
the
induction
notice
but
that
only
those
non-volitional
types
of
claims
which
are
capable
of
ready
verification
by
the
local
board
consisting
as
it
does
of
laymen
meeting
irregularly.
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption,
a
brother
shot
down
in
a
plane
of
something
like
that
that
can
be
verified
with
a
letter
or
a
phone
call
is
something
that
can
clearly
be
disposed
off
by
the
board
one
way
or
the
other
between
the
time
of
notice
of
induction
and
the
time
of
reporting
for
induction
which
is
near
as
i
can
tell
from
these
cases
seems
to
have
run
during
this
period
of
time
of
--
from
between
three
and
four
weeks.
a
claim
to
a
change
in
ones
conscience,
a
change
in
conscientious
status
requiring
as
it
does
both
the
ascertainment
of
a
present
state
of
mind
and
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
is
a
change
of
the
state
of
mind
one
held
prior
to
induction
is
a
factual
and
of
extraordinary
difficulty
and
even
had
this
petitioner
mailed
his
claim
the
day
after
he
received
his
induction
notice,
a
local
board
would
have
had
great
difficulty
passing
on
it,
prior
to
the
time
of
induction
deciding
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
certainly
when
he
mails
it
on
the
day
before
he
is
scheduled
to
report
for
induction,
he
assures
the
absolute
impossibility
of
the
board
being
able
to
pass
on
it.
in
short,
he
assures
himself
regardless
of
the
merits
of
his
claim,
regardless
of
the
merits
of
his
conscientious
objector
claim
or
of
his
claim
to
a
change
of
mind
of
getting
a
postponement
in
the
date
set
for
induction.
and
in
effect,
somebody
else
who
had
a
higher
lottery
number
who
is
not
being
called
that
month
is
put
into
the
manpower
pool
to
replace
him
while
his
case
remains
in
limbo
for
some
un-ascertainable
period
of
time
while
the
local
board
makes
the
determination
if
you
follow
the
gearey
procedure
and
we’re
to
adopt
gearey
as
to
whether
in
fact
there
has
been
a
change
of
status
or
not.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well,
let
me
address
it
right
now
if
i
may.
the
dod
directive
which
we
cite
and
the
assurances
we
have
from
the
general
counsel
of
the
army
as
of
this
past
week
are
that
a
registrant
whose
claim
is
not
passed
upon
on
its
merits
because
--
it
arises
post
induction
notice
isn’t
passed
on
by
under
merits
by
the
selective
service
board
maybe
offered
and
considered
under
the
army
regulations
as
soon
as
the
registrant
is
inducted.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
my
understanding
is
that
as
soon
as
that
kind
of
a
claim
is
made
in
the
army,
the
man
gets
what
is
in
effect
a
desk
job
in
a
situation
where
he
is
not
further
processed
into
the
military
system
until
there
has
been
a
disposition
one
way
or
the
other
of
his
claim.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
prevails
he
gets
discharged.
the
petitioner
claims
that
since
under
his
view
of
the
statute,
it
confers
a
right
of
exemption
on
the
conscientious
objector
and
doesn’t
expressly
authorize
any
regulation
which
may
limit
the
time
in
which
that
claim
can
be
asserted,
that
the
regulation
is
here
applied
by
the
court
below
as
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
therefore
unauthorized.
i
think
this
claim
proves
too
much
and
would
cite
at
least
two
points
in
support
of
that
observation.
there
is
no
expressed
statutory
authority
in
6
(j)
for
barring
the
assertion
of
conscientious
objector
claims
which
have
existed
previous
to
induction
notice
but
haven’t
been
asserted
and
yet
even
the
court’s
which
have
gone
the
gearey
route
have
said
that
this
is
a
proper
function
of
the
regulation
that
the
man
who
was
always
a
conscientious
objector
but
fails
to
assert
it
until
the
time
he
receives
the
induction
notice
can
validly
be
barred
and
yet
there’s
no
statutory
authority
for
that.
it’s
simply
the
application
of
a
procedural
rule
that
is
fairly
designed
to
both
permit
reasonable
processing
of
these
claims
and
to
effectuate
a
necessary
ultimate
cut
off
date
and
change
it.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
his
waiver
is
so
significantly
different
from
a
procedural
cut
off,
neither
of
them
are
expressly
authorized
by
statute,
both
of
them
are
well
recognized
in
almost
any
system
of
procedural
adjudication.
perhaps
waiver
because
it
is
--
you
know,
something
that
every
lawyer
responds
to
almost
instinctively
with
an
affirmative
notion,
maybe
waiver
is
different
but
i
don’t
think
it
that
--
it’s
completely
different
and
i
think
the
type
of
procedural
thing
we’re
talking
about
here
is
by
no
means
completely
distinguishable.
the
same
section
6
(j)
of
the
act
that
confers
the
right
of
conscientious
objector
exemption
also
confers
in
unqualified
terms
a
right
of
appeal
and
although
this
precise
language
is
this,
“any
person
claiming
exemption
from
combatant
training
and
service
because
of
such
conscientious
objection
shall
if
such
claim
is
not
sustained
by
the
local
board,
be
entitled
to
an
appeal
to
the
appropriate
appeal
board”,
and
yet
i
suspect
even
petitioner
wouldn’t
contend
that
the
president
under
his
general
authority
to
promulgate
rules
isn’t
entitled
to
set
some
time
limit
as
within
which
an
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
a
local
board
must
be
taken
to
the
appeal
board.
surely,
on
the
day
before
you
need
to
report
for
the
induction,
you
can’t
come
in
and
say,
“well,
i’ve
decided
to
appeal
to
the
appeal
board
from
the
local
board’s
adverse
ruling
two
years
ago,
that
i
wasn’t
a
conscientious
objector.”
so,
it
simply
is
an
overly
simplistic
to
use
an
overly
used
word.
construction
of
the
statute
to
say
that
because
it
confers
a
right
of
conscientious
objection,
there
may
be
no
procedural
regulations
governing
how
that
right
is
to
be
set
forth
or
how
it
is
to
be
processed,
and
as
occurred
earlier
in
the
colloquy
between
counsel
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
you
parse
the
sections
sentence
by
sentence,
the
only
unqualified
right
conferred,
even
if
you
take
a
literal
reading
is
the
right
to
be
exempt
from
combatant
training
and
service.
the
right
to
be
exempt
from
induction
is
conferred
only
upon
those
who
are
found
by
their
local
boards
to
be
conscientious
objectors.
i
don’t
think
you
can
read
either
one
of
those
statutes’
sense
as
literally
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others.
i
think
that
the
overall
result
that
you
get
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
section
is
that
there
is
a
substantive
right
of
conscientious
objection
and
that
reasonable
rules
are
permissible
so
long
as
they
serve
a
legitimate
and
to
the
selective
service
system
and
its
administration
and
don’t
unreasonably
restrict
the
right
of
the
conscientious
objector
claimant
to
assert
his
claim
in
that
forum.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
are
and
i
regret
to
say
that
the
selective
service
system
in
past
years
not
only
may
have
been
guilty
of
writing
ambiguous
regulations.
it
has
been
guilty
of
not
keeping
as
much
statistical
information
as
it
should.
what
we
have
is
figures
for
august,
september,
october
and
november
of
1970
and
this
is
the
first
time
selective
service
nationally
began
keeping
these
figures.
during
this
four
month
period,
there
was
a
total
manpower
call
of
42,000.
during
the
same
four
month
period,
the
total
number
of
registrants
who
asserted
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims
was
2695.
in
other
words,
the
very
statement
of
petitioner
in
his
brief
that
the
service
will
be
easily
able
to
adjust
to
this
insignificant
insubstantial
burden
is
squarely
at
odds
with
these
facts.
6.42%
of
the
total
manpower
call
in
the
last
four
months
is
asserting
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
not
just
conscientious
objector
claims
but
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims
and
if
you
take
the
states
with
large
metropolitan
jurisdictions,
the
facts
are
even
more
startling.
california
which
leads
the
nation
had
a
draft
call
during
this
period
of
time
of
4191
total
men
called
into
service.
during
that
period,
in
california,
490
persons
asserted
post
notice
conscientious
objection
claims.
if
you
take
the
10
states
with
the
highest
rate
of
post
notice
conscientious
objector
claims,
the
average
rate
of
those
claims
is
11.22%
of
the
total
men
called
to
the
service
in
those
states.
now,
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
justice
black,
i
apologies
to
say
we
didn’t
even
have
this
figures
at
the
time
we
wrote
the
brief.
the
brief
was
submitted
the
first
of
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
california
had
the
most,
new
york
next,
michigan,
massachusetts,
washington,
connecticut,
colorado,
oregon,
rhode
island
and
the
district
of
colombia
in
that
order.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
we
would
be
happy
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
prepare
perhaps
a
more
detailed
summary
of
the
figures
that
i
have
given
here
orally
and
file
them
with
the
court
as
soon
as
possible.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
isn’t
confidential
mr.
justice
stewart
and
we
will
see
to
it
with
the
court’s
permission
that
we
incorporate
that
in
the
same
submission
in
which
we
incorporate
the
statistics.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
my
understanding
mr.
justice
white
is
that
as
soon
as
the
claim
is
presented,
the
man
is
given
what
is
generally
foretold
as
a
desk
job
or
a
headquarters
type
job,
so
that
he
will
be
available
in
the
area
of
the
either
army
center
or
in
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
the
training
is
as
i
understand
it
is
differed
completely
until
the
mans
claim
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
the
affording
of
the
army
forum
rather
than
the
local
board
forum
under
the
circumstances
presented
here
is
consistent
with
the
statute
and
regulation.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
of
no
such
claim.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
far
as
i
know
that
that’s
the
only
difference.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
it’s
a
military
forum,
yes
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
the
issues
are
the
same
and
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
i
know,
it’s
the
same
criteria
and
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
same
as
far
as
i
know
from
reading
their
most
recent
directive
that
they
are
well
aware
of
welsh
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
there
--
i
can’t
give
a
real
accurate
answer,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
it’s
a
series
of
interviews
and
then
there’s
an
army
board
which
evaluates
the
material
gained
and
in
effect
holds
a
hearing.
i’m
not
as
confident
as
i
should
be
in
the
correctness
of
that
response.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
be
happy
too,
if
i
might
submit
that
along
with
the
other
two
management
mr.
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
he’d
have
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedy.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i’ve
been
going
in
the
assumption
that
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
say
make
sense
to
me
but
i
haven’t
examined
that
branch
of
the
law
and
don’t
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
--
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
look
at
the
man
who
does
not,
who
is
a
conscientious
objector
in
1964
gets
an
induction
notice
in
1965,
has
never
had
his
--
has
never
presented
his
claim.
now,
the
local
board
won’t
hear
his
claim.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
i
have
--
i’m
not
at
all
sure
that
when
he’s
inducted,
he
can
necessarily
resort
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
should
think
that
he
could
resort
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
