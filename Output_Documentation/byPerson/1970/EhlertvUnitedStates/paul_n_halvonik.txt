mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petition
in
this
case
is
a
conscientious
objector,
being
such,
he
quite
naturally
refused
to
submit
to
induction,
he
was
tried
for
that
offense,
failure
to
submit
to
induction,
he’s
found
guilty
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
two
years
in
prison.
i
observed
that
it
was
a
conscientious
objector,
however,
that
claim
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
his
local
board
and
the
reason
for
that
is
he
did
not
become
a
conscientious
objector
until
after
he
received
his
notice
to
report
for
induction.
he
couldn’t
apply
for
the
status
before
he
was
conscientious
objector
and
at
the
time
he
became
a
conscientious
objector,
according
to
the
local
board,
it
no
longer
had
jurisdiction
to
review
his
claim
and
that
the
government
contends
is
correct
reading
of
the
selective
service
regulations
and
the
selective
service
law
so
that
an
objector
such
as
ehlert
can
never
have
his
claim
heard.
we
think
the
government’s
risk
misreading
the
regulation
because
there
is
a
regulation
that
provides
for
reopening
of
classifications,
reconsiderations
by
the
local
board,
if
after
an
order
of
court
for
induction
has
been
mailed,
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
registrant’s
status
resulting
from
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
had
no
control.
we
contend
that
that
regulation
is
applicable
here.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes
your
honor
but
the
second
circuit
and
other
circuits
following
the
jury
decision
have
called
it
crystallization
of
conscience.
when
that
moment
arrives,
when
he
decides
that
he
can
do
nothing
else
but
not
participate
in
war,
when
that
moment
comes,
its
crystallization
is
the
circumstance
over
which
he
has
no
control
and
which
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it
comes
at
a
time
which
is
after
the
order
report
for
induction.
the
cases
to
which
i
refer
all
say
that
the
reopening
occurs
under
1625.2
and
that
language
in
that
regulation
is
that
you
have
a
reopening
if
there
were
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
had
no
control.
the
theory
of
the
majority
below
in
the
ninth
circuit
here
that
one
does
have
control
over
his
conscience
and
for
that
reason
the
registrant
wouldn’t
come
within
the
regulation.
i
don’t
think
the
government
is
currently,
at
least
not
being
enthusiastically
supporting
that
view.
the
government
seems
to
say
now
that
this
isn’t
a
circumstance
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
they
cite
no
authority
for
that
and
they
seem
to
claim
that
a
circumstance
has
to
be
some
sort
of
external
event
that’s
verifiable.
i
think
that
--
confused
with
the
circumstances
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation,
the
circumstance
i
assume
the
regulation
means
its
approximate
circumstance.
that
is
to
say,
if
when
after
he
receives
a
notice
to
report
for
induction,
should
be
struck
by
an
automobile
have
a
leg
broken,
the
circumstance
that
results
in
the
reopening
is
not
being
struck
by
an
automobile
but
having
a
broken
leg.
it’s
not
the
external
event
if
you
will
but
personal
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’ll
try
to
speak
up,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
another
analogy
might
be
since
the
government
seems
to
be
saying
that
has
to
the
event
that’s
externally
verifiable
should
a
man
after
receiving
an
order
to
report
for
induction
become
mentally
incompetent.
i
think
we
would
say
that
there
had
been
a
circumstance
for
which
he
had
no
control
which
should
intervene
and
which
required
reclassification.
now,
there
would
be
nothing
outside
the
man
that
we’d
look
to
that,
we
would
call
a
circumstance
and
yet
without
torturing
the
language
at
all,
we
would
say
that
some
circumstance
had
occurred
that
changed
the
status.
he
was
no
longer
competent,
he
was
no
longer
a
person
who
fitted
in
to
the
scheme
of
the
manpower
pool
for
selective
service
system.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
in
both
agree
in
both
of
those
cases.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
partially
what
this
case
is
about.
i
think
that
that’s
the
--
the
principal
controversy
at
the
moment,
it
seems
to
me
there’s
another
problem
here.
if
this
sort
of
case
involving
a
conscientious
objector
--
if
we
should
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
circumstance
within
the
government’s
theory,
that
this
isn’t
the
sort
of
case
where
this
regulation
applies,
then
perhaps
the
regulation
isn’t
authorized
by
congress
because
congress
has
said
that
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
require
a
conscientious
objector
to
serve
and
the
conscientious
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’m
not
sure
precisely
if
that
is
the
same
provision,
nothing
but
it
would
still
be
different,
i
would
get
to
the
different
point
with
any
other
classification
other
than
a
conscientious
objector
could
take
advantage
as
the
government
suggests
of
getting
out
once
he
gets
in
the
army
and
that
would
apply
to
divinity
students
i
suppose
as
well
but
a
conscientious
objector
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true,
that’s
something
over
which
he
definitely
would
have
some
control.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
what
you’re
suggesting
there
i
think
is
that
--
my
interest
here
was
not
whether
he
had
control
or
not
and
that
he
can
control
the
circumstances
perhaps,
get
out
and
perhaps
it
wouldn’t
be
authorized
to
the
divinity
student
neither,
i’m
not
sure
that
there
isn’t
a
real
problem
with
cutting
off
any
of
these
late
maturing
claims,
but
it
seems
to
me
clearly,
the
regulation
itself
contemplates
a
reopening
when
the
claim
is
one
that
couldn’t
have
been
made
before
and
over
which
the
man
had
no
control
and
that’s
the
precise
case
that
we
have
here.
at
least
we
have
that
facially
in
his
application,
he’s
made
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
had
late
crystallization
that
was
conscientious
objector
i
believe
and
additionally
has
made
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
is
a
conscientious
objector,
and
in
that
situation
we
contend
there
should
be
a
reopening.
and
that
we
just
point
out
to
emphasize
additionally
that
if
the
regulation
isn’t
read
that
way,
there
is
no
form
for
this
man.
the
government
at
certain
points
in
the
brief
seems
to
suggest
that
he’s
been
dilatory
but
this
isn’t
just
a
late
claim,
this
is
a
late
maturing
claim,
he
couldn’t
have
made
the
claim
before
he
received
the
order
to
report
for
induction
because
he
was
not
to
his
conscience
and
his
mind
the
conscientious
objector
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
the
difficulty
with
that
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
think
you
understand
it
precisely
and
the
difficulty
with
that
position
is
this
court
noted
in
the
united
states
--
in
the
malloy
case
in
the
footnote
quotation
from
united
states
v
freeman
in
footnote
six,
there
are
conscientious
objectors
in
mr.
ehlert’s
who
cannot
submit
to
induction,
so
that’s
the
form
they
can’t
reach
and
their
objection
is
to
any
participation
with
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
--
the
statutory
scheme
is
to
permit
a
man
to
follow
his
conscience
and
not
submit
to
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
--
not
participate
in
the
service
at
all.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
with
congress,
they
have
to
do
alternative
service
that’s
true.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
they’re
exempted
from
being
inducted
into
the
armed
forces,
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
they
can’t
be
subjected
to
combatant
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
but
once
one
is
abducted,
that’s
what
occurs.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
the
conscientious
objector,
however,
in
the
conscientious
objector
such
as
ehlert
cannot
submit
to
induction
into
the
armed
forces.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
and
we
pointed
out
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
our
closing
brief
here
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1967
act
shows
that
there
was
originally
a
provision
in
that
act
to
provide
the
conscientious
objector,
first
submitted
to
induction
and
that
was
specifically
removed
and
the
point
was
made
in
the
debates
on
the
floor
that
there
are
people
who
cannot
submit
at
all
and
that’s
what
their
conscience
is
about,
and
this
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
military
will
of
course,
that’s
the
claim
that
matures
after
you're
in
the
army.
there’s
another
problem
with
going
to
the
army
for
them.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
he
can’t
reach
the
remedy
because
he
can’t
submit
to
induction.
his
conscience
won’t
permit
him
to,
but
even
if
he
did,
we
still
are
not
sure
whether
that
would
be
the
case
because
the
army
regulation
is
designed
to
provide
a
remedy
for
those
who
become
conscientious
objectors
after
they
enter
the
service
and
this
man
became
one
before
the
time
for
induction
came.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
very
good,
i
shall
try
again
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
only
argument
that
i
can
see,
the
government
essentially
says
that
circumstances
should
not
mean
these
kind
of
circumstances,
i
cannot
see
any
reason
for
that
and
we’ve
tried
to
meet
that
in
the
brief
and
i’ve
tried
to
meet
it
here.
the
only
other
argument
that
the
government
has
made
in
favor
of
its
construction
is
that
it
makes
for
efficiency
and
i
think
that’s
wrong.
it
may
result
in
less
burdens
on
the
local
selective
service
board
but
that
inefficiency
are
not
coterminous,
they’re
not
synonymous,
in
fact
sometimes
they’re
antagonistic.
if
the
selective
service
doesn’t
want
to
look
at
conscientious
objector
claims
at
all,
and
then
just
ignores
them
all,
the
local
boards
won’t
have
any
hearings.
i
suppose
that
it
makes
life
easier
for
them
but
that
doesn’t
make
them
more
efficient
in
their
job,
because
it’s
their
task
to
remove
from
the
manpower
pool
those
people
who
congress
says
are
not
to
serve,
and
that’s
their
job,
and
the
construction,
the
petitioner
seeks
in
this
regulation
promotes
they’re
doing
that
job
and
promotes
assuring
that
a
man
such
as
ehlert
doesn’t
get
to
the
induction
center,
doesn’t
have
to
refuse
and
make
for
inefficiency
throughout
the
governmental
system
because
the
congressional
scheme
is
to
keep
conscientious
objectors
out
before
that
point,
so
that
they’re
not
prosecuted
and
they’re
not
going
to
jail.
i
mean,
that
place
is
the
burden,
shifts
the
burden
if
adopt
the
government’s
theory
from
the
local
boards.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that
essentially
is
what
the
government
is
saying
the
regulation
says,
and
i
would
say
that
such
a
regulation
would
not
be
authorized
by
congress
because
it
provides,
because
the
congress
says
conscientious
objectors
shall
not
be
required
to
submit
and
subject
to
combatant
training
in
service.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
it's
quite
different
from
the
government
regulation
that
says
if
you’re
a
conscientious
objector,
before
you
receive
an
order
to
report
for
induction
and
you
don’t
tell
us
until
after
that
you’re
cut
off
that
slept
on
your
rights,
that
would
raise
some
interesting
questions
but
that’s
not
this
case,
he
didn’t
sleep
on
his
rights.
he
wasn’t
a
conscientious
objector
until
he
receives
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
congress
has
said
conscientious
objectors
should
be
exempted.
i
don’t
see
how
they
can
adopt
to
regulation
that
flies
in
the
facie,
the
congressional
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
but
you
mean
that
you
wouldn’t
have
to
go
a
station
somewhere,
that
you’re
inducted
as
soon
as
you
receive
the
order
to
report
for
induction?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
the
difference
in
that
i
suppose
would
be
that
his
claim
wouldn’t
have
crystallized
and
it’s
early
been
induct
after
the
point
of
induction
if
that
were
the
case
and
then
i
think
the
forum
would
still
have
to
be
provided
for
him
and
the
service
would
provide
such
a
forum.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
would
have
to
be
in
the
service
because
as
you
define
it,
he
is
already
inducted
as
soon
as
soon
as
he
gets
the
notice,
so
he’s
immediately
in
the
army
but
i
don’t
think
congress
was
liable
to
adopt
such
as
system
because
nobody
can
refuse
to
submit
to
induction
under
that
period.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
think
that
would
probably
be
the
case,
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
think
we
find
that
in
all
kinds
of
experiences
in
life
particularly
in
those
where
it’s
a
combination
of
cognitive
fact
of
this
and
emotional
fact
to
this
to
draw
a
romantic
analogy,
i
don’t
think
you’re
will
yourself
into
love
with
somebody
whom
you
know,
it
may
come
for
a
moment
and
then
even
you
can’t
detach
yourself
very
easily
from
it
either,
even
though
everything
rational
on
a
cognitive.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
his
position
was
that
he
would
not
submit
to
induction
your
honor.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
did
anything
happen
after
he
refused
to
submit?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
couldn’t
become
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
now.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
just
couldn’t
and
that’s
not
only
mr.
ehlert,
that’s
--
there
are
a
lot
of
religious
sects,
a
number
of
religious
sects
that
also
adopt
that
philosophy.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
jehovah’s
witnesses
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that
was
a
different
point
from
the
one
i
was
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
was
just
saying
that
there
are
religious
sects
that
cannot
submit
to
induction.
there’s
no
religious
sects
that
says
that
when
you
decide
at
the
last
moment,
you
don’t
go
to
war,
that
that’s
part
of
the
philosophy
but
it
does
happen,
i
might
point
out
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
on
january
5,
adopted
the
construction
of
--
we
advanced
here
in
the
nordlof
case,
they
reverse
their
previous
position
and
joined
the
second
circuit,
and
other
circuits
that
have
adopted
the
construction
we
contend
for
and
that
case
involved
the
jehovah’s
witness.
a
man
who
married
a
jehovah’s
witness
before
he
receive
his
order
to
report
for
induction
and
went
to
through
a
period
of
talking
with
his
wife
and
her
parents
and
hadn't
decided
he
was
a
jehovah’s
witness
yet
and
really
it
didn’t
put
it
all
together
until
after
he’d
received
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
and
then
he
talks
some
more
and
he
finally
concluded
that
he
was
indeed
a
conscientious
objector
and
he
didn’t
raise
it
until
he
got
down
to
the
induction
center
and
that’s
when
he
raised
the
point
and
the
seventh
circuit
held
a
very
scholarly
opinion
that
this
man
was
entitled
for
benefit
of
regulation
section
1625.2.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it’s
united
state
v.
nordlof,
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
was
decided
on
january
5.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
nordlof,
n
o
r
d
l
o
f.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
until
he
got
to
the
induction
center.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
in
this
context,
the
two
circuits
that
had
faced
the
question
have
decided
that
it’s
an
extension
of
selective
service.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that
maybe
but
of
course
the
government
contented
for
years
that
it
was
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
that
always
occurred
there
if
you
didn’t
go
through
physical
or
something
of
that
nature
and
so
that
it
was
really
an
extension
of
selective
service
and
that
both
the
second
circuit
in
stanford,
now
the
seventh
circuit
in
nordlof
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
extensions
of
selective
service
system
for
the
purposes
of
re-openings
where
a
change
has
occurred
after
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
and
that’s
not
so
strange
because
it
happens
all
the
time
in
physicals,
you
know,
physical
examinations
if
its
determined
down
there.
even
though
the
application
had
been
made
before
if
its
determined
that
the
selective
service
induction
center
that
the
man
isn’t
physically
fit,
if
there’s
been
a
change,
he’s
taken
out
of
the
--
he
is
given
a
one
y
or
four
f
and
he’s
not
inducted.
but
anyway,
i
was
saying
that
i
don’t
think
that
our
construction
at
all
produces
any
problems
as
far
as
the
efficiency
of
the
selective
service
system
that
the
construction
that
we
seek
in
this
regulation
would
result
the
selective
service
system
doing
what
its
job
is
and
not
having
conscientious
objectors
in
jails
where
none
of
the
purposes
of
penology
are
served.
and
on
the
other
side,
the
construction
that
we
seek
provides
nothing
but
a
forum
for
those
who
have
late
maturing
claims.
and
one
thing
they
have
to
establish
is
that
their
claim
is
late
maturing
under
the
construction
we
seek.
a
man
who’d
been
dilatory
or
slept
on
his
rights
wouldn’t
get
the
advantage
of
the
rule
that
we
are
seeking
here,
we
don’t
foreclose
that
possibility
but
as
far
as
ehlert’s
concerned,
his
was
a
late
maturing
claim,
he’s
made
a
prima
facie
case
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
and
there
is
no
reason
and
no
suggestion
by
congress
that
conscientious
objector
are
to
be
treated
differently
from
other
people
who
are
deferred
or
exempted
under
the
draft
and
yet
that
is
what
happens
if
we
accept
the
government’s
construction,
because
persons
with
other
sorts
of
claims,
other
sorts
of
change
of
status
for
example,
somebody
becoming
a
sole
surviving
son
after
a
order
to
report
for
induction,
even
the
government
concedes
that
their
cases
can
be
reopened.
there’s
no
reason
to
think
that
the
conscientious
objector
shouldn’t
be
reopened,
the
congressional
history
is
clear
that
a
conscientious
objector
is
supposed
to
be
given
the
same
sort
of
treatment
as
every
other
person
exempted
or
deferred.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
but
that
as
a
matter
is
not
beyond
his
control,
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
he’s
treated
that
way
because
it
isn’t
the
matter
beyond
his
control
but
everybody
else
was
something
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
that’s
the
reason
he’s
not
treated
the
same.
if
students
were
drafted
to
colleges
and
a
man
received
his
draft
notice
to
school
after
he
received
this
draft
notice
report
for
induction,
i
would
assume
that
he
would
be
exempted.
it
doesn’t
happen
that
way
but
it
does
happen
that
way
with
conscientious
objectors,
there
is
a
moment
in
time
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
precisely,
of
course
that’s
the
analogy
that
the
jehovah’s
witnesses
use.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
the
second
circuit
has
your
honor
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it’s
about
evenly
divided.
now,
the
government
said
the
way
to
the
circuits
was
with
them
but
i
think
it’s
even
now
because
with
the
seven
switching.
may
i
say
that
the
contrary
construction
goes
back
by
countering
in
the
government’s
construction
goes
back
to
united
states
v.
shobel
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that’s
where
they
all
began
and
that
case
is
now
overruled
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
one
other
point
i
should
make
about
the
nordlof
case
is
that
relates
to
the
decision
by
three
members
of
the
panel
in
the
seventh
circuit.
there’s
a
notation
in
the
footnote
that
it
was
circulated
among
all
the
members
and
majority
agree
with
inclusion
that
shobel
should
be
expressly
overruled.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
first
talk
about
these
figures
because
i
hadn’t
heard
them
before
either.
i
noticed
they
were
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
very
good,
let
me
--
if
i
can
also
just
comment
on
some
initial
thoughts
which
is
that
these
figures
referred
to
post
notice
claims,
again,
the
government
hasn’t
made
the
distinction
between
dilatory
claims
and
late
maturing
claims
and
the
government
has
continued
throughout
this
litigation
to
ignore
that
distinction
and
apparently
it
has
in
gathering
its
statistics
too,
so
they’re
not
very
helpful,
but
the
most
remarkable
thing
i
found
about
them
was
that
california
is
a
place
where
they
have
the
largest
number
of
these
claims,
california
where
ehlert’s
the
law
not
new
york
where
gearey
is
the
law.
now,
if
that
tells
us
anything
then
at
least
means
that
the
rule,
the
petitioner
is
asking
for
does
not
encourage
late
claims.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
have
any
effect
on
the
number
of
them,
they’re
going
to
be
there
anyway
and
they’re
going
to
have
to
be
dealt
with
and
they’ll
have
to
be
dealt
with
either
by
prosecutors
or
the
army
or
the
selective
service
system.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
he’s
not
going
to
get
it
heard
if
he
can’t
submit
to
induction,
the
government
does
admit
to
that.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
and
let
me
quote
from
footnote
six
in
malloy
where
this
court
said,
quoting
approvingly
from
the
seventh
circuit
decision,
“a
sincere
claimant
for
conscientious
objector
status
cannot
turn
to
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
to
challenge
the
legality
of
his
classification
because
this
religious
belief
prevents
him
from
accepting
induction
under
any
circumstances.”
it’s
a
previously
recognized
principle
of
this
court.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true.
we
found
this
particular
memorandum
and
we
used
it
to
demonstrate
but
it
didn’t
look
like
things
were
going
to
get
too
disrupted.
it
wasn’t
applicable
in
ehlert’s
case
because
of
course,
this
occurred
before
the
memorandum
was
issued.
whether
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
can’t
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
puzzles
me
too
and
we
just
found
it
and
included
it
but
i
don’t
know.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
the
way
we
understand
it
but
i
have
no
explanation
for
it
and
i
assume
the
local
boards
are
following
the
directive
but
i
can’t
be
absolutely
sure.
let
me
again
be
--
on
the
habeas
corpus
and
besides
the
client
not
being
able
to
reach
it
in
this
case,
there
certainly
are
conscientious
objectors
who
can
submit
to
induction,
we
know
that
from
the
number
of
habeas
petitions
but
there
are
these
difficulties
and
first
of
all,
that’s
not
the
efficient
way
to
handle
it.
the
government
keeps
talking
about
efficiency
but
the
proper
forum
for
these
kinds
of
questions
is
the
local
board.
the
government
office
tells
us
about
the
merits
of
the
local
board,
the
weller
case
they
told
the
court
that
you
have
these
people
who
are
from
your
area
that
are
expert
on
passing
on
these
questions
and
they
do
it
in
a
non-adversary
manner
and
how
fine
it
is.
well,
if
it’s
that
way
then
the
petitioner
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
go
to
that
forum,
that’s
the
forum
congress
wants
it
in.
we
also
in
our
brief
quoted
and
grant
it
its
from
another
context
but
we
think
the
principle
is
applicable
here
from
o'callahan
says,
“unlike
courts,
it
is
the
primary
business
of
armies
and
navies
to
fight
or
be
ready
to
fight
war
should
the
occasion
arise
but
trial
of
soldiers
to
maintain
discipline
is
merely
incidental
to
an
army’s
primary
fighting
function,
to
the
extent
that
those
responsible
for
performance
of
this
primary
function
are
diverted
from
it
by
the
necessity
of
trying
cases,
the
basic
fighting
purposes
of
armies
is
not
served.”
how
is
the
army
served
by
taking
these
2000
cases
or
however
they
many
--
many
they
may
be
and
providing
that
sort
of
remedy,
granted
there
won’t
be
that
many
because
there
were
group
that
are
going
to
go
to
jail,
the
courts
will
be
providing
the
forum
and
they’ll
off
to
jail
but
they
will
be
getting
some.
how
are
they
better
equipped
to
handle
it?
why
is
it
more
efficient
for
them
to
handle
it?
and
what
about
the
courts,
we’re
talking
about
california
and
the
number
of
late
claims
there.
let’s
assume
some
of
those
are
late
maturing
claims
and
should
be
reopened
and
some
men
aren’t
going
to
submit
to
induction.
believe
me,
the
california
federal
courts
don’t
need
any
more
selective
service
prosecutions
and
you
can’t
avoid
them
here,
you
certainly
can
avoid
it
where
it’s
a
question
of
conscience.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
board.
i
would
assume
the
conviction
would
be
reversed
and
judge
zirpoli
indicated
at
the
trial
that
if
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
ell,
i
should
think
that
with
the
conviction
ought
to
be
reversed
because
he
has
made
a
prima
facie
claim,
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
they
ought
to
go
back
to
the
board
right
for
determination
but
the
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
agree
with
the
government
that
he
has
to
make
a
prima
facie
claim
where
we
disagree
with
the
government
is
that
we
think
he
has
made
the
prima
facie
showing.
we
think
clearly
under
welsh,
he
made
the
showing.
the
government
emphasized
throughout
that
he
kept
saying
today
but
he
was
talking
about
a
nuclear
age
not
a
nuclear
war
and
to
go
back
to
this
court’s
decision
in
sicurella
case,
this
court
used
today
throughout,
it
is
the
kind
of
wars
we
fight
today,
what
we’re
talking
about.
that’s
the
kind
of
war
that
my
client
can’t
fight
and
a
war
that
would
happen
after
1945,
a
war
that
would
happen
since
he
has
been
two
or
three
years
old.
under
his
theory,
it
wouldn’t
have
been
a
conscientious
objector
before
he
was
three
but
since
then
he
wouldn’t
and
for
all
time,
it
would
be
a
conscientious
objector.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
because
of
the
atomic
bomb.
he’s
not
saying
he
won’t
participate
in
nuclear
war,
he
is
saying
he
won’t
participate
in
war
in
a
nuclear
age
and
unfortunately,
he
is
not
going
to
get
a
chance
at
any
other
age.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petition
in
this
case
is
a
conscientious
objector,
being
such,
he
quite
naturally
refused
to
submit
to
induction,
he
was
tried
for
that
offense,
failure
to
submit
to
induction,
he’s
found
guilty
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
two
years
in
prison.
i
observed
that
it
was
a
conscientious
objector,
however,
that
claim
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
his
local
board
and
the
reason
for
that
is
he
did
not
become
a
conscientious
objector
until
after
he
received
his
notice
to
report
for
induction.
he
couldn’t
apply
for
the
status
before
he
was
conscientious
objector
and
at
the
time
he
became
a
conscientious
objector,
according
to
the
local
board,
it
no
longer
had
jurisdiction
to
review
his
claim
and
that
the
government
contends
is
correct
reading
of
the
selective
service
regulations
and
the
selective
service
law
so
that
an
objector
such
as
ehlert
can
never
have
his
claim
heard.
we
think
the
government’s
risk
misreading
the
regulation
because
there
is
a
regulation
that
provides
for
reopening
of
classifications,
reconsiderations
by
the
local
board,
if
after
an
order
of
court
for
induction
has
been
mailed,
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
registrant’s
status
resulting
from
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
had
no
control.
we
contend
that
that
regulation
is
applicable
here.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes
your
honor
but
the
second
circuit
and
other
circuits
following
the
jury
decision
have
called
it
crystallization
of
conscience.
when
that
moment
arrives,
when
he
decides
that
he
can
do
nothing
else
but
not
participate
in
war,
when
that
moment
comes,
its
crystallization
is
the
circumstance
over
which
he
has
no
control
and
which
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it
comes
at
a
time
which
is
after
the
order
report
for
induction.
the
cases
to
which
i
refer
all
say
that
the
reopening
occurs
under
1625.2
and
that
language
in
that
regulation
is
that
you
have
a
reopening
if
there
were
circumstances
over
which
the
registrant
had
no
control.
the
theory
of
the
majority
below
in
the
ninth
circuit
here
that
one
does
have
control
over
his
conscience
and
for
that
reason
the
registrant
wouldn’t
come
within
the
regulation.
i
don’t
think
the
government
is
currently,
at
least
not
being
enthusiastically
supporting
that
view.
the
government
seems
to
say
now
that
this
isn’t
a
circumstance
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
they
cite
no
authority
for
that
and
they
seem
to
claim
that
a
circumstance
has
to
be
some
sort
of
external
event
that’s
verifiable.
i
think
that
--
confused
with
the
circumstances
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation,
the
circumstance
i
assume
the
regulation
means
its
approximate
circumstance.
that
is
to
say,
if
when
after
he
receives
a
notice
to
report
for
induction,
should
be
struck
by
an
automobile
have
a
leg
broken,
the
circumstance
that
results
in
the
reopening
is
not
being
struck
by
an
automobile
but
having
a
broken
leg.
it’s
not
the
external
event
if
you
will
but
personal
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’ll
try
to
speak
up,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
another
analogy
might
be
since
the
government
seems
to
be
saying
that
has
to
the
event
that’s
externally
verifiable
should
a
man
after
receiving
an
order
to
report
for
induction
become
mentally
incompetent.
i
think
we
would
say
that
there
had
been
a
circumstance
for
which
he
had
no
control
which
should
intervene
and
which
required
reclassification.
now,
there
would
be
nothing
outside
the
man
that
we’d
look
to
that,
we
would
call
a
circumstance
and
yet
without
torturing
the
language
at
all,
we
would
say
that
some
circumstance
had
occurred
that
changed
the
status.
he
was
no
longer
competent,
he
was
no
longer
a
person
who
fitted
in
to
the
scheme
of
the
manpower
pool
for
selective
service
system.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
in
both
agree
in
both
of
those
cases.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
partially
what
this
case
is
about.
i
think
that
that’s
the
--
the
principal
controversy
at
the
moment,
it
seems
to
me
there’s
another
problem
here.
if
this
sort
of
case
involving
a
conscientious
objector
--
if
we
should
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
circumstance
within
the
government’s
theory,
that
this
isn’t
the
sort
of
case
where
this
regulation
applies,
then
perhaps
the
regulation
isn’t
authorized
by
congress
because
congress
has
said
that
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
require
a
conscientious
objector
to
serve
and
the
conscientious
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’m
not
sure
precisely
if
that
is
the
same
provision,
nothing
but
it
would
still
be
different,
i
would
get
to
the
different
point
with
any
other
classification
other
than
a
conscientious
objector
could
take
advantage
as
the
government
suggests
of
getting
out
once
he
gets
in
the
army
and
that
would
apply
to
divinity
students
i
suppose
as
well
but
a
conscientious
objector
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true,
that’s
something
over
which
he
definitely
would
have
some
control.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
what
you’re
suggesting
there
i
think
is
that
--
my
interest
here
was
not
whether
he
had
control
or
not
and
that
he
can
control
the
circumstances
perhaps,
get
out
and
perhaps
it
wouldn’t
be
authorized
to
the
divinity
student
neither,
i’m
not
sure
that
there
isn’t
a
real
problem
with
cutting
off
any
of
these
late
maturing
claims,
but
it
seems
to
me
clearly,
the
regulation
itself
contemplates
a
reopening
when
the
claim
is
one
that
couldn’t
have
been
made
before
and
over
which
the
man
had
no
control
and
that’s
the
precise
case
that
we
have
here.
at
least
we
have
that
facially
in
his
application,
he’s
made
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
had
late
crystallization
that
was
conscientious
objector
i
believe
and
additionally
has
made
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
is
a
conscientious
objector,
and
in
that
situation
we
contend
there
should
be
a
reopening.
and
that
we
just
point
out
to
emphasize
additionally
that
if
the
regulation
isn’t
read
that
way,
there
is
no
form
for
this
man.
the
government
at
certain
points
in
the
brief
seems
to
suggest
that
he’s
been
dilatory
but
this
isn’t
just
a
late
claim,
this
is
a
late
maturing
claim,
he
couldn’t
have
made
the
claim
before
he
received
the
order
to
report
for
induction
because
he
was
not
to
his
conscience
and
his
mind
the
conscientious
objector
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
the
difficulty
with
that
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
think
you
understand
it
precisely
and
the
difficulty
with
that
position
is
this
court
noted
in
the
united
states
--
in
the
malloy
case
in
the
footnote
quotation
from
united
states
v
freeman
in
footnote
six,
there
are
conscientious
objectors
in
mr.
ehlert’s
who
cannot
submit
to
induction,
so
that’s
the
form
they
can’t
reach
and
their
objection
is
to
any
participation
with
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
--
the
statutory
scheme
is
to
permit
a
man
to
follow
his
conscience
and
not
submit
to
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
--
not
participate
in
the
service
at
all.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
with
congress,
they
have
to
do
alternative
service
that’s
true.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
they’re
exempted
from
being
inducted
into
the
armed
forces,
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
they
can’t
be
subjected
to
combatant
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
but
once
one
is
abducted,
that’s
what
occurs.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
the
conscientious
objector,
however,
in
the
conscientious
objector
such
as
ehlert
cannot
submit
to
induction
into
the
armed
forces.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
and
we
pointed
out
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
our
closing
brief
here
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1967
act
shows
that
there
was
originally
a
provision
in
that
act
to
provide
the
conscientious
objector,
first
submitted
to
induction
and
that
was
specifically
removed
and
the
point
was
made
in
the
debates
on
the
floor
that
there
are
people
who
cannot
submit
at
all
and
that’s
what
their
conscience
is
about,
and
this
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
military
will
of
course,
that’s
the
claim
that
matures
after
you're
in
the
army.
there’s
another
problem
with
going
to
the
army
for
them.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
he
can’t
reach
the
remedy
because
he
can’t
submit
to
induction.
his
conscience
won’t
permit
him
to,
but
even
if
he
did,
we
still
are
not
sure
whether
that
would
be
the
case
because
the
army
regulation
is
designed
to
provide
a
remedy
for
those
who
become
conscientious
objectors
after
they
enter
the
service
and
this
man
became
one
before
the
time
for
induction
came.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
very
good,
i
shall
try
again
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
only
argument
that
i
can
see,
the
government
essentially
says
that
circumstances
should
not
mean
these
kind
of
circumstances,
i
cannot
see
any
reason
for
that
and
we’ve
tried
to
meet
that
in
the
brief
and
i’ve
tried
to
meet
it
here.
the
only
other
argument
that
the
government
has
made
in
favor
of
its
construction
is
that
it
makes
for
efficiency
and
i
think
that’s
wrong.
it
may
result
in
less
burdens
on
the
local
selective
service
board
but
that
inefficiency
are
not
coterminous,
they’re
not
synonymous,
in
fact
sometimes
they’re
antagonistic.
if
the
selective
service
doesn’t
want
to
look
at
conscientious
objector
claims
at
all,
and
then
just
ignores
them
all,
the
local
boards
won’t
have
any
hearings.
i
suppose
that
it
makes
life
easier
for
them
but
that
doesn’t
make
them
more
efficient
in
their
job,
because
it’s
their
task
to
remove
from
the
manpower
pool
those
people
who
congress
says
are
not
to
serve,
and
that’s
their
job,
and
the
construction,
the
petitioner
seeks
in
this
regulation
promotes
they’re
doing
that
job
and
promotes
assuring
that
a
man
such
as
ehlert
doesn’t
get
to
the
induction
center,
doesn’t
have
to
refuse
and
make
for
inefficiency
throughout
the
governmental
system
because
the
congressional
scheme
is
to
keep
conscientious
objectors
out
before
that
point,
so
that
they’re
not
prosecuted
and
they’re
not
going
to
jail.
i
mean,
that
place
is
the
burden,
shifts
the
burden
if
adopt
the
government’s
theory
from
the
local
boards.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that
essentially
is
what
the
government
is
saying
the
regulation
says,
and
i
would
say
that
such
a
regulation
would
not
be
authorized
by
congress
because
it
provides,
because
the
congress
says
conscientious
objectors
shall
not
be
required
to
submit
and
subject
to
combatant
training
in
service.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
it's
quite
different
from
the
government
regulation
that
says
if
you’re
a
conscientious
objector,
before
you
receive
an
order
to
report
for
induction
and
you
don’t
tell
us
until
after
that
you’re
cut
off
that
slept
on
your
rights,
that
would
raise
some
interesting
questions
but
that’s
not
this
case,
he
didn’t
sleep
on
his
rights.
he
wasn’t
a
conscientious
objector
until
he
receives
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
congress
has
said
conscientious
objectors
should
be
exempted.
i
don’t
see
how
they
can
adopt
to
regulation
that
flies
in
the
facie,
the
congressional
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
but
you
mean
that
you
wouldn’t
have
to
go
a
station
somewhere,
that
you’re
inducted
as
soon
as
you
receive
the
order
to
report
for
induction?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
the
difference
in
that
i
suppose
would
be
that
his
claim
wouldn’t
have
crystallized
and
it’s
early
been
induct
after
the
point
of
induction
if
that
were
the
case
and
then
i
think
the
forum
would
still
have
to
be
provided
for
him
and
the
service
would
provide
such
a
forum.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
would
have
to
be
in
the
service
because
as
you
define
it,
he
is
already
inducted
as
soon
as
soon
as
he
gets
the
notice,
so
he’s
immediately
in
the
army
but
i
don’t
think
congress
was
liable
to
adopt
such
as
system
because
nobody
can
refuse
to
submit
to
induction
under
that
period.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
think
that
would
probably
be
the
case,
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
think
we
find
that
in
all
kinds
of
experiences
in
life
particularly
in
those
where
it’s
a
combination
of
cognitive
fact
of
this
and
emotional
fact
to
this
to
draw
a
romantic
analogy,
i
don’t
think
you’re
will
yourself
into
love
with
somebody
whom
you
know,
it
may
come
for
a
moment
and
then
even
you
can’t
detach
yourself
very
easily
from
it
either,
even
though
everything
rational
on
a
cognitive.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
his
position
was
that
he
would
not
submit
to
induction
your
honor.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
did
anything
happen
after
he
refused
to
submit?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
couldn’t
become
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
now.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
just
couldn’t
and
that’s
not
only
mr.
ehlert,
that’s
--
there
are
a
lot
of
religious
sects,
a
number
of
religious
sects
that
also
adopt
that
philosophy.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
jehovah’s
witnesses
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that
was
a
different
point
from
the
one
i
was
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
was
just
saying
that
there
are
religious
sects
that
cannot
submit
to
induction.
there’s
no
religious
sects
that
says
that
when
you
decide
at
the
last
moment,
you
don’t
go
to
war,
that
that’s
part
of
the
philosophy
but
it
does
happen,
i
might
point
out
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
on
january
5,
adopted
the
construction
of
--
we
advanced
here
in
the
nordlof
case,
they
reverse
their
previous
position
and
joined
the
second
circuit,
and
other
circuits
that
have
adopted
the
construction
we
contend
for
and
that
case
involved
the
jehovah’s
witness.
a
man
who
married
a
jehovah’s
witness
before
he
receive
his
order
to
report
for
induction
and
went
to
through
a
period
of
talking
with
his
wife
and
her
parents
and
hadn't
decided
he
was
a
jehovah’s
witness
yet
and
really
it
didn’t
put
it
all
together
until
after
he’d
received
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
and
then
he
talks
some
more
and
he
finally
concluded
that
he
was
indeed
a
conscientious
objector
and
he
didn’t
raise
it
until
he
got
down
to
the
induction
center
and
that’s
when
he
raised
the
point
and
the
seventh
circuit
held
a
very
scholarly
opinion
that
this
man
was
entitled
for
benefit
of
regulation
section
1625.2.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it’s
united
state
v.
nordlof,
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
was
decided
on
january
5.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
nordlof,
n
o
r
d
l
o
f.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
until
he
got
to
the
induction
center.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
in
this
context,
the
two
circuits
that
had
faced
the
question
have
decided
that
it’s
an
extension
of
selective
service.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
that
maybe
but
of
course
the
government
contented
for
years
that
it
was
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
that
always
occurred
there
if
you
didn’t
go
through
physical
or
something
of
that
nature
and
so
that
it
was
really
an
extension
of
selective
service
and
that
both
the
second
circuit
in
stanford,
now
the
seventh
circuit
in
nordlof
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
extensions
of
selective
service
system
for
the
purposes
of
re-openings
where
a
change
has
occurred
after
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
and
that’s
not
so
strange
because
it
happens
all
the
time
in
physicals,
you
know,
physical
examinations
if
its
determined
down
there.
even
though
the
application
had
been
made
before
if
its
determined
that
the
selective
service
induction
center
that
the
man
isn’t
physically
fit,
if
there’s
been
a
change,
he’s
taken
out
of
the
--
he
is
given
a
one
y
or
four
f
and
he’s
not
inducted.
but
anyway,
i
was
saying
that
i
don’t
think
that
our
construction
at
all
produces
any
problems
as
far
as
the
efficiency
of
the
selective
service
system
that
the
construction
that
we
seek
in
this
regulation
would
result
the
selective
service
system
doing
what
its
job
is
and
not
having
conscientious
objectors
in
jails
where
none
of
the
purposes
of
penology
are
served.
and
on
the
other
side,
the
construction
that
we
seek
provides
nothing
but
a
forum
for
those
who
have
late
maturing
claims.
and
one
thing
they
have
to
establish
is
that
their
claim
is
late
maturing
under
the
construction
we
seek.
a
man
who’d
been
dilatory
or
slept
on
his
rights
wouldn’t
get
the
advantage
of
the
rule
that
we
are
seeking
here,
we
don’t
foreclose
that
possibility
but
as
far
as
ehlert’s
concerned,
his
was
a
late
maturing
claim,
he’s
made
a
prima
facie
case
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
and
there
is
no
reason
and
no
suggestion
by
congress
that
conscientious
objector
are
to
be
treated
differently
from
other
people
who
are
deferred
or
exempted
under
the
draft
and
yet
that
is
what
happens
if
we
accept
the
government’s
construction,
because
persons
with
other
sorts
of
claims,
other
sorts
of
change
of
status
for
example,
somebody
becoming
a
sole
surviving
son
after
a
order
to
report
for
induction,
even
the
government
concedes
that
their
cases
can
be
reopened.
there’s
no
reason
to
think
that
the
conscientious
objector
shouldn’t
be
reopened,
the
congressional
history
is
clear
that
a
conscientious
objector
is
supposed
to
be
given
the
same
sort
of
treatment
as
every
other
person
exempted
or
deferred.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
but
that
as
a
matter
is
not
beyond
his
control,
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
he’s
treated
that
way
because
it
isn’t
the
matter
beyond
his
control
but
everybody
else
was
something
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
that’s
the
reason
he’s
not
treated
the
same.
if
students
were
drafted
to
colleges
and
a
man
received
his
draft
notice
to
school
after
he
received
this
draft
notice
report
for
induction,
i
would
assume
that
he
would
be
exempted.
it
doesn’t
happen
that
way
but
it
does
happen
that
way
with
conscientious
objectors,
there
is
a
moment
in
time
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
precisely,
of
course
that’s
the
analogy
that
the
jehovah’s
witnesses
use.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
the
second
circuit
has
your
honor
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it’s
about
evenly
divided.
now,
the
government
said
the
way
to
the
circuits
was
with
them
but
i
think
it’s
even
now
because
with
the
seven
switching.
may
i
say
that
the
contrary
construction
goes
back
by
countering
in
the
government’s
construction
goes
back
to
united
states
v.
shobel
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that’s
where
they
all
began
and
that
case
is
now
overruled
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
one
other
point
i
should
make
about
the
nordlof
case
is
that
relates
to
the
decision
by
three
members
of
the
panel
in
the
seventh
circuit.
there’s
a
notation
in
the
footnote
that
it
was
circulated
among
all
the
members
and
majority
agree
with
inclusion
that
shobel
should
be
expressly
overruled.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
first
talk
about
these
figures
because
i
hadn’t
heard
them
before
either.
i
noticed
they
were
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
very
good,
let
me
--
if
i
can
also
just
comment
on
some
initial
thoughts
which
is
that
these
figures
referred
to
post
notice
claims,
again,
the
government
hasn’t
made
the
distinction
between
dilatory
claims
and
late
maturing
claims
and
the
government
has
continued
throughout
this
litigation
to
ignore
that
distinction
and
apparently
it
has
in
gathering
its
statistics
too,
so
they’re
not
very
helpful,
but
the
most
remarkable
thing
i
found
about
them
was
that
california
is
a
place
where
they
have
the
largest
number
of
these
claims,
california
where
ehlert’s
the
law
not
new
york
where
gearey
is
the
law.
now,
if
that
tells
us
anything
then
at
least
means
that
the
rule,
the
petitioner
is
asking
for
does
not
encourage
late
claims.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
have
any
effect
on
the
number
of
them,
they’re
going
to
be
there
anyway
and
they’re
going
to
have
to
be
dealt
with
and
they’ll
have
to
be
dealt
with
either
by
prosecutors
or
the
army
or
the
selective
service
system.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
he’s
not
going
to
get
it
heard
if
he
can’t
submit
to
induction,
the
government
does
admit
to
that.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
and
let
me
quote
from
footnote
six
in
malloy
where
this
court
said,
quoting
approvingly
from
the
seventh
circuit
decision,
“a
sincere
claimant
for
conscientious
objector
status
cannot
turn
to
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
to
challenge
the
legality
of
his
classification
because
this
religious
belief
prevents
him
from
accepting
induction
under
any
circumstances.”
it’s
a
previously
recognized
principle
of
this
court.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true.
we
found
this
particular
memorandum
and
we
used
it
to
demonstrate
but
it
didn’t
look
like
things
were
going
to
get
too
disrupted.
it
wasn’t
applicable
in
ehlert’s
case
because
of
course,
this
occurred
before
the
memorandum
was
issued.
whether
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
can’t
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
puzzles
me
too
and
we
just
found
it
and
included
it
but
i
don’t
know.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
true.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
the
way
we
understand
it
but
i
have
no
explanation
for
it
and
i
assume
the
local
boards
are
following
the
directive
but
i
can’t
be
absolutely
sure.
let
me
again
be
--
on
the
habeas
corpus
and
besides
the
client
not
being
able
to
reach
it
in
this
case,
there
certainly
are
conscientious
objectors
who
can
submit
to
induction,
we
know
that
from
the
number
of
habeas
petitions
but
there
are
these
difficulties
and
first
of
all,
that’s
not
the
efficient
way
to
handle
it.
the
government
keeps
talking
about
efficiency
but
the
proper
forum
for
these
kinds
of
questions
is
the
local
board.
the
government
office
tells
us
about
the
merits
of
the
local
board,
the
weller
case
they
told
the
court
that
you
have
these
people
who
are
from
your
area
that
are
expert
on
passing
on
these
questions
and
they
do
it
in
a
non-adversary
manner
and
how
fine
it
is.
well,
if
it’s
that
way
then
the
petitioner
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
go
to
that
forum,
that’s
the
forum
congress
wants
it
in.
we
also
in
our
brief
quoted
and
grant
it
its
from
another
context
but
we
think
the
principle
is
applicable
here
from
o'callahan
says,
“unlike
courts,
it
is
the
primary
business
of
armies
and
navies
to
fight
or
be
ready
to
fight
war
should
the
occasion
arise
but
trial
of
soldiers
to
maintain
discipline
is
merely
incidental
to
an
army’s
primary
fighting
function,
to
the
extent
that
those
responsible
for
performance
of
this
primary
function
are
diverted
from
it
by
the
necessity
of
trying
cases,
the
basic
fighting
purposes
of
armies
is
not
served.”
how
is
the
army
served
by
taking
these
2000
cases
or
however
they
many
--
many
they
may
be
and
providing
that
sort
of
remedy,
granted
there
won’t
be
that
many
because
there
were
group
that
are
going
to
go
to
jail,
the
courts
will
be
providing
the
forum
and
they’ll
off
to
jail
but
they
will
be
getting
some.
how
are
they
better
equipped
to
handle
it?
why
is
it
more
efficient
for
them
to
handle
it?
and
what
about
the
courts,
we’re
talking
about
california
and
the
number
of
late
claims
there.
let’s
assume
some
of
those
are
late
maturing
claims
and
should
be
reopened
and
some
men
aren’t
going
to
submit
to
induction.
believe
me,
the
california
federal
courts
don’t
need
any
more
selective
service
prosecutions
and
you
can’t
avoid
them
here,
you
certainly
can
avoid
it
where
it’s
a
question
of
conscience.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
board.
i
would
assume
the
conviction
would
be
reversed
and
judge
zirpoli
indicated
at
the
trial
that
if
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
ell,
i
should
think
that
with
the
conviction
ought
to
be
reversed
because
he
has
made
a
prima
facie
claim,
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
they
ought
to
go
back
to
the
board
right
for
determination
but
the
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
agree
with
the
government
that
he
has
to
make
a
prima
facie
claim
where
we
disagree
with
the
government
is
that
we
think
he
has
made
the
prima
facie
showing.
we
think
clearly
under
welsh,
he
made
the
showing.
the
government
emphasized
throughout
that
he
kept
saying
today
but
he
was
talking
about
a
nuclear
age
not
a
nuclear
war
and
to
go
back
to
this
court’s
decision
in
sicurella
case,
this
court
used
today
throughout,
it
is
the
kind
of
wars
we
fight
today,
what
we’re
talking
about.
that’s
the
kind
of
war
that
my
client
can’t
fight
and
a
war
that
would
happen
after
1945,
a
war
that
would
happen
since
he
has
been
two
or
three
years
old.
under
his
theory,
it
wouldn’t
have
been
a
conscientious
objector
before
he
was
three
but
since
then
he
wouldn’t
and
for
all
time,
it
would
be
a
conscientious
objector.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
because
of
the
atomic
bomb.
he’s
not
saying
he
won’t
participate
in
nuclear
war,
he
is
saying
he
won’t
participate
in
war
in
a
nuclear
age
and
unfortunately,
he
is
not
going
to
get
a
chance
at
any
other
age.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
