mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
another
chapter,
and
we
hope
the
final
chapter,
in
a
story
of
a
criminal
prosecution
that
commenced
in
1958.
this
case
comes
here
after
the
united
states
district
court
in
a
decision
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
ordered
the
state
of
california
to
hold
a
new
hearing
in
the
state
courts
on
the
question
of
whether
atchley’s
confession
was
voluntarily
given,
which
confession
was
introduced
to
this
trial
over
objection
and
a
lengthy
hearing
at
the
trial.
the
question
have
been
reviewed
and
affirmed
by
unite--
by
a
unanimous
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
the
decisions
of
the
state
courts
which
were,
adverse
to
atchley,
brought
to
this
court.
i
think
the
issue
that
is
really
presented
today
is
whether
a
state
supreme
court
decision
on
the
merits
of
a
federal
claim
in
a
criminal
case
can
be
given
a
presumption
of
correctness
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
now,
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
in
the
negative,
then
the
state
appellate
review
of
federal
constitutional
claims
in
criminal
cases
is
an
utter
waste
of
time
for
everyone
concerned,
and
state
appellate
courts
would
be
well
advised
to
relegate
criminal
defendants
to
the
criminal
courts
for
the
immediate
litigation
of
their
constitutional
arguments.
now,
by
way
of
procedural
background,
atchley
was
convicted
of
murder
in
january
1959,
after
a
jury
trial
in
the
superior
court
for
butte
county,
california.
because
he
was
sentenced
to
death,
and
incidentally
that
sentence
was
subsequently
commuted
to
life
imprisonment
and
then
commuted
again
to
allow
him
the
possibility
of
parole
for
which
he
is
presently
eligible,
his
appeal
to
the
california
state
supreme
court
was
automatic.
that
court
affirmed
the
conviction
in
a
unanimous
opinion
authored
by
then
associate
justice
traynor,
to
which
we
will
refer
in
some
detail
later.
suffice
to
say
at
this
point,
the
principal
issue
raised
by
atchley
on
his
state
appeal
was
whether
his
confession
was
voluntarily
made.
the
california
supreme
court
concluded
that
it
was.
atchley
then
came
to
this
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
granted.
briefs
were
filed.
the
record
was
filed
and
the
case
was
argued
but
after
hearing
argument
and
examining
the
record
of
the
state
proceedings,
this
court
dismissed
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted.
shortly
thereafter,
atchley
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
this
was
denied
summarily,
and
the
denial
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1967,
atchley
filed
a
second
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
that
petition
challenged
the
admission
into
evidence
of
a
tape
recorded
confession
which
he
had
given
to
his
friend,
an
insurance
agent,
one
ray
travers,
the
same
issue
that
had
been
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court.
the
district
court
granted
the
writ.
it
did
not
say
that
atchley’s
confession
was
involuntary.
indeed,
the
court
admitted
that
it
could
not
say
that
atchley’s
confession
was
involuntary.
the
district
court
avoided
the
necessity
of
passing
on
that
issue
by
holding
that
the
procedure
followed
in
the
state
trial
court
was
not
fully
adequate
to
achieve
a
reliable
determination
that
atchley’s
confession
was
voluntary.
by
the
order
of
the
district
court,
we
are
relegated
to
the
state
courts
for
a
further
hearing
on
this
issue
with
the
possibility
of
further
appeals
in
the
state
and
federal
courts,
and
atchley
loses
again.
we
say
that
the
district
court
erred
in
refusing
to
apply
the
presumption
of
correctness
contained
in
title
28
united
states
code
section
2254
(d)
which
was
enacted
in
1956.
the
trial
court
re--
the
district
court
refused
to
apply
the
presumption
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
district
court
concluded
that
a
clear-cut
determination
of
voluntariness
did
not
appear
on
the
state
court
record.
secondly,
the
district
court
stated
that
the
trial
court
had
applied
an
erroneous
legal
standard.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
for
three
distinct
reasons.
first,
there
was
a
definite
ruling
on
the
merits
of
atchley’s
constitutional
claim
in
both
the
trial
court
and
the
california
supreme
court.
the
district
court
totally
ignored
the
independent
review
of
the
california
supreme
court,
focused
its
attention
on
the
trial
court.
it
was
wrong
in
both
instances.
first
of
all,
as
regard
to
trial
court,
i
point
out
that
california
is
a
jurisdiction
that
adheres
to
the
massachusetts
or
humane
rule
in
determining
the
admissibility
of
confessions.
that
is
to
say,
the
question
of
voluntariness
is
one
that
is
to
be
determined,
first
of
all,
by
the
trial
judge
and,
if
the
trial
judge
finds
the
confession
voluntarily
made,
the
confession
is
again
submitted--
is
submitted
to
the
jury
for
a
second
albeit
redundant
determination
of
the
voluntariness
question.
this
court,
in
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black,
has
indeed
recognized
that
california
does
follow
the
massachusetts
or
humane
rule.
now,
atchley
had
a
ruling
on
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession
when
the
trial
court,
over
objection,
allowed
the
confession
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
while
the
trial
court
did
not
give
detail
and
specific
instructions
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury,
this
is
unnecessary
for
purposes
of
federal
review,
because
all
that
jackson
d--
versus
denno
requires
is
that
the
trial
judge
make
a
determination.
when
that
is
done,
the
question
of
whether
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
jury
for
a
second
determination
is
solely
one
of
state
law.
so,
there
were
complaints
with
jackson
versus
denno
in
the
trial
court
and
there
was
also
a
definite
ruling
on
the
merits
by
the
california
supreme
court.
that
court
exercised
the
power
of
independent
review
and
found
the
confession
voluntary.
now,
the
district
court,
we
submit,
erred
in
holding
that
the
material
facts
were
not
fully
developed.
each
of
the
alleged
inadequacies
relied
on
by
the
district
court
in
the
development
of
the
facts
can
be
answered
by
an
examination
of
the
straight--
state
trial
record
and
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
atchley
was
trying
to
contact
a
particular
attorney
in
san
jose,
and
this
is
a
point
that
the
district
court
said
wasn’t
sufficiently
explored,
well
this
was
brought
out
in
the
trial
record.
it
was
considered
by
the
california
supreme
court.
in
this
case,
the
record
also
showed
that
atchley
was
not
an
indigent.
he
was
a
man
who
ran
a
used
car
business,
speculated
in
small
parcels
of
property.
he
had
an
access
to--
he
had
access
to
the
telephone
while
he
was
under
arrest,
and
he
had
retained
local
attorneys
to
carry
on
some
civil
litigation
in
connection
with
his
business
activities.
in
any
event,
atchley
spontaneously
confessed
to
a
third
party,
and
that
is
why,
even
if
there
was
a
clear-cut
showing
of
denial
of
counsel,
it
would
have
little,
if
any,
weight
under
these
circumstances.
california
supreme
court
also
considered
the
point
and,
moreover,
escobedo,
which
was
a
first
decision
by
this
court
to
specifically
make
a
request
for
counsel
and
the
denial
thereof
determinative
in
a
confession
case,
escobedo
is
not
retroactively
applied.
the
second
point
that
the
district
court
said
was
inadequately
developed
was
travers’
concealment
from
atchley
of
his
motives
for
having
a
second
conversation.
now,
i
would
point
out,
although
it’s
spelled
out
in
great
detail
in
the
briefs,
i
would
point
out
for
the
illumination
of
the
court
at
this
point
that
there
were
two
conversations.
about
two
days
after
he
was
arrested,
mr.
atchley
called
his
insurance
agent,
one
ray
travers.
he
called
him
down
to
the
jail
to
talk
about
the
circumstances
of
his
insurance,
the
changes
that
resulted
from
his
condition
of
arrest.
now
at
that
time,
spontaneously,
without
any
involvement
of
law
enforcement,
atchley
admitted
to
travers
that
he
had
fired
the
shots
that
killed
his
wife.
travers
reported
this
to
the
police.
the
police
asked
travers
if
he
would
go
back
and
get
a
second
statement
from
atchley
that
they
would
tape
record.
he
agreed
to
do
so
because,
and
this
appears
in
the
record,
he
had
told
atchley
that
he
was
coming
back
to
get
further
information
in
any
event.
now,
it’s
a
second
of
these
statements--
the
second
statement
that
was
tape
recorded,
that
was
at
issue
here.
in
any
event,
the
supreme
court
reviewed
this
matter
of
deception
and
held
that
this
would
not
make
a
statement
involuntary
because
it
was
not
the
sort
of
deception
that
would
be
likely
to
produce
an
untrustworthy
statement.
third,
the
district
court
said
that
the
fact
that
atchley
did
not
know
that
the
conversation
would
be
recorded,
that
this
wasn’t
adequately
developed,
but
it
was
in
the
record.
it
was
considered
by
the
california
supreme
court,
and
atchley’s
lack
of
knowledge
of
this
point
would
hardly
put
on
any
pressure
on
him
to
confess.
finally--
no,
fourth,
what
the
officers
said
to
travers,
again,
this
was
relied
on
by
the
district
court,
but
this
wasn’t
material
to
atchley’s
state
of
mind.
there’s
no
question
that
travers
was
acting
on
behalf
of
law
enforcement
at
the
time
the
second
confession
was
given.
we
don’t
deny
that
at
all.
fifth
evidence
of
his
mental
condition,
says
the
district
court,
was
not
adequately
developed.
but,
atchley
did
not
offer
evidence
of
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
he
made
the
confession.
his
offer
of
proof
is
the
state
of
mind
at
his
trial
when
only
to
the
time
of
the
shooting.
the
district
court
also
said
that
atchley
should’ve
been
allowed
to
develop
proof
of
his
education,
his
limited
background.
well,
the
trial
court,
when
the
prosecution
objected
to
this
t--
the
proof
of
this
nature,
overruled
the
prosecution
objection
and
allowed
defense
counsel
to
proceed.
however,
the
reason
this
point
wasn’t
developed
is
that
defense
counsel
went
on
to
another
line
of
inquiry,
and
that
appears
at
147.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
he
testified
to
the
second,
and
the
tape
recording
of
the
second
conversation
was
played
to
the
jury.
since
the
commencement
of
this
proceeding
in
the
federal
court,
atchley
has
never
specifically
suggested
any
additional
evidence
that
was
not
already
contained
in
the
trial
court
record.
indeed,
he
has
abundantly
documented
his
argument
that
his
statement
was
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law,
with
citations
to
testimony
in
the
record
of
the
state
trial
proceedings.
now,
we
must
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
a
very
tepid
case
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
title
28
united
states
code
section
2254
(d).
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
november
2,
1966,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
dissatisfaction
with
this
court’s
decisions
in
faye
versus
noya
and
townsend
versus
sain,
and
the
great
expansion
of
the
use
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
courts
to
mount
collateral
attack
on
state
criminal
convictions.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
believe
it
did
,your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
believe
it
did.
i
think
there
was
some
modification
though.
i
think
that,
at
one
point
in
the
judicial
conference,
it
was
suggested
that
federal
habeas
corpus
cases
be
tried
by
three-judge
federal
courts
and
this
proposal
was
specifically
deleted
in
the
legislation
as
it
was
passed
by
congress
for
the
reason
that
it
was
felt
that
the
three-judge
court
requirement
would
pose
an
undue
burden
on
the
federal
judiciary.
your
honor,
the
legislative
history
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it
is
relatively
short.
the
committee
reports
are
relatively
short,
and
we
respectfully
commend
them
to
your
honors’
attention.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
justice
brennan,
it’s
been
suggested
that
2254
(d)
is
a
codification
of
townsend
versus
sain.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
it
doesn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
those
two
sections
have
in
common
is
that
criteria
are
present.
first
of
all--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
for
one
thing,
the
sixth
criteria
in
townsend
versus
sain,
namely
that
the
federal
court,
whenever
he
feels
he
ought
to,
can
grant
a
hearing.
that
was
specifically
deleted.
also
specifically
deleted
was
a
provision
in
townsend
versus
sain
which
allowed
federal
habe--
the
federal
habeas
court
to
grant
a
hearing
on
substantial
allegations
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
now,
this
one
was
deleted
and
it’s
interesting
to
note.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
omitted,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
interesting
to
note
though,
that,
contemporaneously,
congress
amended
2244
which
involved
subsequent
hearings
on
federal.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
excuse
me.
2244
relating
to
subsequent
hearings
in
federal
courts
after
a
hearing
in
a
federal
court
on
the
merits
or
after
a
hearing
in
this
court
after
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
determination
on
the
merits,
and
those
provisions
contain
mention
of
newly
discovered
evidence
as
a
ground
for
a
grant
of
a
further
hearing,
but
it’s
not
contained
in
2254
(d).
i
think
that’s
significant.
second
big
difference
between
townsend
versus
sain
in
2254
(d)
is
this.
that
under
townsend
versus
sain,
where
the
criteria
were
satisfied,
the
federal
district
court
was
permitted,
authorized
if
you
will,
to
accept
the
state
court
finding
vers--
findings
of
fact.
under
the
statute,
the
federal
district
court
is
required
to
accept
the
findings
of
fact.
in
other
words,
it
turns--
the
section,
if
you
will,
turns
the
authorization
of
townsend
versus
sain
into
an
actual
requirement.
also,
the
petitioner
is
given
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
criteria
for
the
adequacy
of
state
courts
hearings
are
not
present.
a
second
further
distinction
is
that
3354
(d)
changed
the
burden
of
proof
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
now,
traditionally,
as
in
all
civil
cases,
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
was
on
the
petitioner,
but
it
was
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
only.
2254
(d)
says
that
where
the
criteria
are
satisfied,
proof
must
be
made
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
obviously,
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
we
think
the
district
court
erred
for
the
further
reason
that
it
totally
ignored,
in
its
order,
the
effect
of
the
independent
review
afforded
actually
by
the
california
supreme
court.
just
as
this
court
does
in
confession
cases,
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state
of
california
afford
independent
review
in
confession
cases.
therefore,
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
should
have
been
afforded
a
presumption
of
correctness
separate
and
apart
from
that
given
the
trial
court.
now,
we
think
it’s
quite
reasonable,
given
the
policy
behind
section
2254
(d),
to
apply
it
to
the
opinions
of
state
appellate
courts
when
they
consider
claims
on
the
merits.
obviously,
2254
(d)
refers
to
“a
determination
after
the
hearing
on
the
merits
of
a
factual
issue,
and
while
this
section
obviously
contemplates
a
determination
by
a
trial
judge
after
a
hearing,
it
ought
not
to
be
confined
to
that
meaning.
there
are
two
additional
interpretations
to
which
the
section
is
reasonably
susceptible.
first,
the
determination
may
refer
to
the
decision
of
an
appellate
court--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
we
have--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
wish
i
could’ve
argued
that
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
the
reason
i
couldn’t
is
because--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
a
denial
of
certiorari,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
not
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i’ve
always
understood,
your
honor,
that
a
dismissal
of
certiorari,
after
hearing,
argument
is
a
denial
of
hearing.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
that’s
fairly--
i
think
that’s
fairly
apparent
from
your
honor’s
language.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
could
never
be
offended
by
winning
a
case
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
idon’t
think--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
is--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
it’s
a
little
bit
than
a
simple
denial,
but
in
the
light
of
faye
versus
noya,
in
the
light
of
2244
which
talks
about
a
determination
on
the
merits,
i
didn’t
feel
i
could
conscientiously
argue
that
it
was.
particularly,
when
the
point
that
i’m
seeking
to
present
to
this
court
has
much
more
important
implications
for
federal
state
relations--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
would
like
both,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
would
like
both
and,
if
i
can’t
have
both,
i
will
take
one.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
always
a
risk.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
the
determination
mentioned
in
2254
(d)
can
refer
to
determinations
by
state
appellate
courts
which
pass
upon
the
merits
of
federal
questions.
now,
in
the
years
just
past,
this
court
has
taken
many
steps
to
extend
state
appellate
review
to
state
prisoners.
beginning
in
griffin
versus
illinois
in
which
it
provided
transcripts,
the
proceeding
through
douglas
versus
california
in
which
it
made
the
appointment
of
counsel
mandatory,
in
culminating
in
anders
versus
california
in
which
it
stated
that
counsel
on
the
state
appeal
must
prevent--
present
every
non-frivolous
claim,
this
court
has
proceeded
to
compel
the
states
to
set
up
meaningful
appellate
procedure
for
the
review
of
the
merits
of
federal
claims.
how
can
this
court
now,
by
refusing
to
apply
the
presumption
of
correctness
to
the
state
appellate
decision,
say
that
state
appellate
decisions
are
meaningless
when
this
court
itself
has
said
that
the
state
must
provide
meaningful
appellate
review?
there
are
compelling
reasons,
we
think,
for
extending
the
presumption
of
correctness
to
state
appellate
decisions.
first
of
all,
we
think
most
respectfully,
that
faye
versus
noya
underestimated
the
great
importance
of
finality
in
the
criminal
law.
we
think
that
state
court
decisions,
where
full
procedural
fairness
has
been
afforded
up
and
down
the
line,
ought
to
be
given
finality.
perhaps
a
most
important
reason
is
to
strengthen
public
confidence
in
the
administration
of
justice.
nothing
erodes
that
confidence
as
much
as
the
constant
litigation
and
re-litigation
and
re-litigation
again
of
claims
in
the
federal
courts
by
state
prisoners.
extending
the
presumption
of
state
appellate
decisions
will
encourage
state
appellate
courts
to
review
federal
claims
on
the
merits.
i
think
that
every
commentator
who
has
considered
the
matter
has
concluded
that
federal
claims
should
be
considered
on
the
merits
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
trial
has
been
completed.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
in
doing
the
trial,
too.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
at
the
first
opportunity
that
they’re
fairly
raised.
your
honor,
i
think
also
that
what
the
district
court
did
here
that
was
wrong
was
reviewing
this
state
trial
record
in
the
microscopic
examination
illuminated
by
the
glare
of
hindsight.
if
we--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
because
we
didn’t
think
it
was
a
ruling.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
we
didn’t
think
the
decision
in
this
court
was
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
now,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
rebut
counsel.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you,
your
honor.
i’ll
use
them
briefly
to
reply
to
counsel’s
argument.
he
lays
heavy
stress
on
alleged
inducements.
this
was,
i
think,
dispositively
answered
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
on
the
original
appeal.
moreover,
the
recorded
conversation
demonstrates--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i’m
reading
from--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
page
32
of
our
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
california
supreme
court
opinion,
i
believe,
is
also
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
but
i
can’t
find
it
now.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
moreover,
the
recorded
conversation
demonstrates
that
travers
referred
to
the
insurance
policy
to
explain
why
he
was
asking
questions
and
not
as
an
inducement
for
any
particular
answers.
the
trial
court
listened
to
the
tape
in
chambers
before
ruling
on
its
admissibility.
now,
as
far
as
the
counsel
point,
of
course,
if
johnson
versus
new
jersey
means
anything,
it
means
that
escobedo
and
miranda
are
not
retroactive.
moreover,
the
counsel
point
was
considered
as
a
circumstance
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
assessing
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
now,
counsel
argues
that
state
appellate
review
is
not
comparable
to
federal
habeas
corpus
because
of
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
i
would
answer
this.
that,
in
a
state
appellate
practice,
the
substantial
evidence
rule
does
not
come
into
play
at
all
until
there
has
been
an
original
determination
of
procedural
fairness.
in
other
words,
where
the
procedural
fairness
of
the
hearing
itself
is
challenged,
counsel-confrontation,
that
sort
of
thing,
where
those
things
are
challenged,
substantial
evidence
can’t
be
determined
until
the
procedural
questions
are
answered
and
this
is
roughly
analogous
to
what
congress
has
provided
in
2254
(d).
in
other
words,
state
hearings
are
to
be
given
finality
where
the
state
courts
have
afforded
substantial
procedural
fairness.
it
was
a
step
in
the
direction
of
what
professor
bator
proposed
in
his
law
review
article
which
we
cite
and
refer
to
in
our
briefs.
we
think
it
ought
to
be
adopted
by
this
court.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that,
in
the
ultimate,
the
ultimate
determination
is
this.
we
live
in
a
federal
system.
this
case
gives
the
court
an
opportunity
to
show
that
federalism
is
a
two-way
street.
state
courts
are
required
to
apply
federal
law.
state
judges
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution.
the
obligation
of
the
states
to
apply
the
constitution
ought
to
call
forth
from
this
court
a
corresponding
grant
of
confidence
in
the
state
courts
to
apply
it
correctly.
i
think,
from
an
examination
of
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
here,
it’s
obvious
that
the
constitution
was
correctly
applied
in
this
case,
and
we
respectfully
submit
the
matter.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
another
chapter,
and
we
hope
the
final
chapter,
in
a
story
of
a
criminal
prosecution
that
commenced
in
1958.
this
case
comes
here
after
the
united
states
district
court
in
a
decision
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
ordered
the
state
of
california
to
hold
a
new
hearing
in
the
state
courts
on
the
question
of
whether
atchley’s
confession
was
voluntarily
given,
which
confession
was
introduced
to
this
trial
over
objection
and
a
lengthy
hearing
at
the
trial.
the
question
have
been
reviewed
and
affirmed
by
unite--
by
a
unanimous
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
the
decisions
of
the
state
courts
which
were,
adverse
to
atchley,
brought
to
this
court.
i
think
the
issue
that
is
really
presented
today
is
whether
a
state
supreme
court
decision
on
the
merits
of
a
federal
claim
in
a
criminal
case
can
be
given
a
presumption
of
correctness
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
now,
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
in
the
negative,
then
the
state
appellate
review
of
federal
constitutional
claims
in
criminal
cases
is
an
utter
waste
of
time
for
everyone
concerned,
and
state
appellate
courts
would
be
well
advised
to
relegate
criminal
defendants
to
the
criminal
courts
for
the
immediate
litigation
of
their
constitutional
arguments.
now,
by
way
of
procedural
background,
atchley
was
convicted
of
murder
in
january
1959,
after
a
jury
trial
in
the
superior
court
for
butte
county,
california.
because
he
was
sentenced
to
death,
and
incidentally
that
sentence
was
subsequently
commuted
to
life
imprisonment
and
then
commuted
again
to
allow
him
the
possibility
of
parole
for
which
he
is
presently
eligible,
his
appeal
to
the
california
state
supreme
court
was
automatic.
that
court
affirmed
the
conviction
in
a
unanimous
opinion
authored
by
then
associate
justice
traynor,
to
which
we
will
refer
in
some
detail
later.
suffice
to
say
at
this
point,
the
principal
issue
raised
by
atchley
on
his
state
appeal
was
whether
his
confession
was
voluntarily
made.
the
california
supreme
court
concluded
that
it
was.
atchley
then
came
to
this
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
granted.
briefs
were
filed.
the
record
was
filed
and
the
case
was
argued
but
after
hearing
argument
and
examining
the
record
of
the
state
proceedings,
this
court
dismissed
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted.
shortly
thereafter,
atchley
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
this
was
denied
summarily,
and
the
denial
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1967,
atchley
filed
a
second
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
that
petition
challenged
the
admission
into
evidence
of
a
tape
recorded
confession
which
he
had
given
to
his
friend,
an
insurance
agent,
one
ray
travers,
the
same
issue
that
had
been
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court.
the
district
court
granted
the
writ.
it
did
not
say
that
atchley’s
confession
was
involuntary.
indeed,
the
court
admitted
that
it
could
not
say
that
atchley’s
confession
was
involuntary.
the
district
court
avoided
the
necessity
of
passing
on
that
issue
by
holding
that
the
procedure
followed
in
the
state
trial
court
was
not
fully
adequate
to
achieve
a
reliable
determination
that
atchley’s
confession
was
voluntary.
by
the
order
of
the
district
court,
we
are
relegated
to
the
state
courts
for
a
further
hearing
on
this
issue
with
the
possibility
of
further
appeals
in
the
state
and
federal
courts,
and
atchley
loses
again.
we
say
that
the
district
court
erred
in
refusing
to
apply
the
presumption
of
correctness
contained
in
title
28
united
states
code
section
2254
(d)
which
was
enacted
in
1956.
the
trial
court
re--
the
district
court
refused
to
apply
the
presumption
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
district
court
concluded
that
a
clear-cut
determination
of
voluntariness
did
not
appear
on
the
state
court
record.
secondly,
the
district
court
stated
that
the
trial
court
had
applied
an
erroneous
legal
standard.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
for
three
distinct
reasons.
first,
there
was
a
definite
ruling
on
the
merits
of
atchley’s
constitutional
claim
in
both
the
trial
court
and
the
california
supreme
court.
the
district
court
totally
ignored
the
independent
review
of
the
california
supreme
court,
focused
its
attention
on
the
trial
court.
it
was
wrong
in
both
instances.
first
of
all,
as
regard
to
trial
court,
i
point
out
that
california
is
a
jurisdiction
that
adheres
to
the
massachusetts
or
humane
rule
in
determining
the
admissibility
of
confessions.
that
is
to
say,
the
question
of
voluntariness
is
one
that
is
to
be
determined,
first
of
all,
by
the
trial
judge
and,
if
the
trial
judge
finds
the
confession
voluntarily
made,
the
confession
is
again
submitted--
is
submitted
to
the
jury
for
a
second
albeit
redundant
determination
of
the
voluntariness
question.
this
court,
in
jackson
versus
denno
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black,
has
indeed
recognized
that
california
does
follow
the
massachusetts
or
humane
rule.
now,
atchley
had
a
ruling
on
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession
when
the
trial
court,
over
objection,
allowed
the
confession
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
while
the
trial
court
did
not
give
detail
and
specific
instructions
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury,
this
is
unnecessary
for
purposes
of
federal
review,
because
all
that
jackson
d--
versus
denno
requires
is
that
the
trial
judge
make
a
determination.
when
that
is
done,
the
question
of
whether
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
jury
for
a
second
determination
is
solely
one
of
state
law.
so,
there
were
complaints
with
jackson
versus
denno
in
the
trial
court
and
there
was
also
a
definite
ruling
on
the
merits
by
the
california
supreme
court.
that
court
exercised
the
power
of
independent
review
and
found
the
confession
voluntary.
now,
the
district
court,
we
submit,
erred
in
holding
that
the
material
facts
were
not
fully
developed.
each
of
the
alleged
inadequacies
relied
on
by
the
district
court
in
the
development
of
the
facts
can
be
answered
by
an
examination
of
the
straight--
state
trial
record
and
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
atchley
was
trying
to
contact
a
particular
attorney
in
san
jose,
and
this
is
a
point
that
the
district
court
said
wasn’t
sufficiently
explored,
well
this
was
brought
out
in
the
trial
record.
it
was
considered
by
the
california
supreme
court.
in
this
case,
the
record
also
showed
that
atchley
was
not
an
indigent.
he
was
a
man
who
ran
a
used
car
business,
speculated
in
small
parcels
of
property.
he
had
an
access
to--
he
had
access
to
the
telephone
while
he
was
under
arrest,
and
he
had
retained
local
attorneys
to
carry
on
some
civil
litigation
in
connection
with
his
business
activities.
in
any
event,
atchley
spontaneously
confessed
to
a
third
party,
and
that
is
why,
even
if
there
was
a
clear-cut
showing
of
denial
of
counsel,
it
would
have
little,
if
any,
weight
under
these
circumstances.
california
supreme
court
also
considered
the
point
and,
moreover,
escobedo,
which
was
a
first
decision
by
this
court
to
specifically
make
a
request
for
counsel
and
the
denial
thereof
determinative
in
a
confession
case,
escobedo
is
not
retroactively
applied.
the
second
point
that
the
district
court
said
was
inadequately
developed
was
travers’
concealment
from
atchley
of
his
motives
for
having
a
second
conversation.
now,
i
would
point
out,
although
it’s
spelled
out
in
great
detail
in
the
briefs,
i
would
point
out
for
the
illumination
of
the
court
at
this
point
that
there
were
two
conversations.
about
two
days
after
he
was
arrested,
mr.
atchley
called
his
insurance
agent,
one
ray
travers.
he
called
him
down
to
the
jail
to
talk
about
the
circumstances
of
his
insurance,
the
changes
that
resulted
from
his
condition
of
arrest.
now
at
that
time,
spontaneously,
without
any
involvement
of
law
enforcement,
atchley
admitted
to
travers
that
he
had
fired
the
shots
that
killed
his
wife.
travers
reported
this
to
the
police.
the
police
asked
travers
if
he
would
go
back
and
get
a
second
statement
from
atchley
that
they
would
tape
record.
he
agreed
to
do
so
because,
and
this
appears
in
the
record,
he
had
told
atchley
that
he
was
coming
back
to
get
further
information
in
any
event.
now,
it’s
a
second
of
these
statements--
the
second
statement
that
was
tape
recorded,
that
was
at
issue
here.
in
any
event,
the
supreme
court
reviewed
this
matter
of
deception
and
held
that
this
would
not
make
a
statement
involuntary
because
it
was
not
the
sort
of
deception
that
would
be
likely
to
produce
an
untrustworthy
statement.
third,
the
district
court
said
that
the
fact
that
atchley
did
not
know
that
the
conversation
would
be
recorded,
that
this
wasn’t
adequately
developed,
but
it
was
in
the
record.
it
was
considered
by
the
california
supreme
court,
and
atchley’s
lack
of
knowledge
of
this
point
would
hardly
put
on
any
pressure
on
him
to
confess.
finally--
no,
fourth,
what
the
officers
said
to
travers,
again,
this
was
relied
on
by
the
district
court,
but
this
wasn’t
material
to
atchley’s
state
of
mind.
there’s
no
question
that
travers
was
acting
on
behalf
of
law
enforcement
at
the
time
the
second
confession
was
given.
we
don’t
deny
that
at
all.
fifth
evidence
of
his
mental
condition,
says
the
district
court,
was
not
adequately
developed.
but,
atchley
did
not
offer
evidence
of
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
he
made
the
confession.
his
offer
of
proof
is
the
state
of
mind
at
his
trial
when
only
to
the
time
of
the
shooting.
the
district
court
also
said
that
atchley
should’ve
been
allowed
to
develop
proof
of
his
education,
his
limited
background.
well,
the
trial
court,
when
the
prosecution
objected
to
this
t--
the
proof
of
this
nature,
overruled
the
prosecution
objection
and
allowed
defense
counsel
to
proceed.
however,
the
reason
this
point
wasn’t
developed
is
that
defense
counsel
went
on
to
another
line
of
inquiry,
and
that
appears
at
147.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
he
testified
to
the
second,
and
the
tape
recording
of
the
second
conversation
was
played
to
the
jury.
since
the
commencement
of
this
proceeding
in
the
federal
court,
atchley
has
never
specifically
suggested
any
additional
evidence
that
was
not
already
contained
in
the
trial
court
record.
indeed,
he
has
abundantly
documented
his
argument
that
his
statement
was
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law,
with
citations
to
testimony
in
the
record
of
the
state
trial
proceedings.
now,
we
must
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
a
very
tepid
case
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
title
28
united
states
code
section
2254
(d).
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
november
2,
1966,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
dissatisfaction
with
this
court’s
decisions
in
faye
versus
noya
and
townsend
versus
sain,
and
the
great
expansion
of
the
use
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
courts
to
mount
collateral
attack
on
state
criminal
convictions.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
believe
it
did
,your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
believe
it
did.
i
think
there
was
some
modification
though.
i
think
that,
at
one
point
in
the
judicial
conference,
it
was
suggested
that
federal
habeas
corpus
cases
be
tried
by
three-judge
federal
courts
and
this
proposal
was
specifically
deleted
in
the
legislation
as
it
was
passed
by
congress
for
the
reason
that
it
was
felt
that
the
three-judge
court
requirement
would
pose
an
undue
burden
on
the
federal
judiciary.
your
honor,
the
legislative
history
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it
is
relatively
short.
the
committee
reports
are
relatively
short,
and
we
respectfully
commend
them
to
your
honors’
attention.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
justice
brennan,
it’s
been
suggested
that
2254
(d)
is
a
codification
of
townsend
versus
sain.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
it
doesn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
those
two
sections
have
in
common
is
that
criteria
are
present.
first
of
all--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
for
one
thing,
the
sixth
criteria
in
townsend
versus
sain,
namely
that
the
federal
court,
whenever
he
feels
he
ought
to,
can
grant
a
hearing.
that
was
specifically
deleted.
also
specifically
deleted
was
a
provision
in
townsend
versus
sain
which
allowed
federal
habe--
the
federal
habeas
court
to
grant
a
hearing
on
substantial
allegations
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
now,
this
one
was
deleted
and
it’s
interesting
to
note.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
omitted,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
interesting
to
note
though,
that,
contemporaneously,
congress
amended
2244
which
involved
subsequent
hearings
on
federal.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
excuse
me.
2244
relating
to
subsequent
hearings
in
federal
courts
after
a
hearing
in
a
federal
court
on
the
merits
or
after
a
hearing
in
this
court
after
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
determination
on
the
merits,
and
those
provisions
contain
mention
of
newly
discovered
evidence
as
a
ground
for
a
grant
of
a
further
hearing,
but
it’s
not
contained
in
2254
(d).
i
think
that’s
significant.
second
big
difference
between
townsend
versus
sain
in
2254
(d)
is
this.
that
under
townsend
versus
sain,
where
the
criteria
were
satisfied,
the
federal
district
court
was
permitted,
authorized
if
you
will,
to
accept
the
state
court
finding
vers--
findings
of
fact.
under
the
statute,
the
federal
district
court
is
required
to
accept
the
findings
of
fact.
in
other
words,
it
turns--
the
section,
if
you
will,
turns
the
authorization
of
townsend
versus
sain
into
an
actual
requirement.
also,
the
petitioner
is
given
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
criteria
for
the
adequacy
of
state
courts
hearings
are
not
present.
a
second
further
distinction
is
that
3354
(d)
changed
the
burden
of
proof
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
now,
traditionally,
as
in
all
civil
cases,
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
was
on
the
petitioner,
but
it
was
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
only.
2254
(d)
says
that
where
the
criteria
are
satisfied,
proof
must
be
made
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
obviously,
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
we
think
the
district
court
erred
for
the
further
reason
that
it
totally
ignored,
in
its
order,
the
effect
of
the
independent
review
afforded
actually
by
the
california
supreme
court.
just
as
this
court
does
in
confession
cases,
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state
of
california
afford
independent
review
in
confession
cases.
therefore,
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
should
have
been
afforded
a
presumption
of
correctness
separate
and
apart
from
that
given
the
trial
court.
now,
we
think
it’s
quite
reasonable,
given
the
policy
behind
section
2254
(d),
to
apply
it
to
the
opinions
of
state
appellate
courts
when
they
consider
claims
on
the
merits.
obviously,
2254
(d)
refers
to
“a
determination
after
the
hearing
on
the
merits
of
a
factual
issue,
and
while
this
section
obviously
contemplates
a
determination
by
a
trial
judge
after
a
hearing,
it
ought
not
to
be
confined
to
that
meaning.
there
are
two
additional
interpretations
to
which
the
section
is
reasonably
susceptible.
first,
the
determination
may
refer
to
the
decision
of
an
appellate
court--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
we
have--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
wish
i
could’ve
argued
that
in
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
the
reason
i
couldn’t
is
because--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
a
denial
of
certiorari,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it’s
not
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i’ve
always
understood,
your
honor,
that
a
dismissal
of
certiorari,
after
hearing,
argument
is
a
denial
of
hearing.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
that’s
fairly--
i
think
that’s
fairly
apparent
from
your
honor’s
language.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor,
i
could
never
be
offended
by
winning
a
case
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
idon’t
think--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
is--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
it’s
a
little
bit
than
a
simple
denial,
but
in
the
light
of
faye
versus
noya,
in
the
light
of
2244
which
talks
about
a
determination
on
the
merits,
i
didn’t
feel
i
could
conscientiously
argue
that
it
was.
particularly,
when
the
point
that
i’m
seeking
to
present
to
this
court
has
much
more
important
implications
for
federal
state
relations--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
would
like
both,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
would
like
both
and,
if
i
can’t
have
both,
i
will
take
one.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
always
a
risk.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
the
determination
mentioned
in
2254
(d)
can
refer
to
determinations
by
state
appellate
courts
which
pass
upon
the
merits
of
federal
questions.
now,
in
the
years
just
past,
this
court
has
taken
many
steps
to
extend
state
appellate
review
to
state
prisoners.
beginning
in
griffin
versus
illinois
in
which
it
provided
transcripts,
the
proceeding
through
douglas
versus
california
in
which
it
made
the
appointment
of
counsel
mandatory,
in
culminating
in
anders
versus
california
in
which
it
stated
that
counsel
on
the
state
appeal
must
prevent--
present
every
non-frivolous
claim,
this
court
has
proceeded
to
compel
the
states
to
set
up
meaningful
appellate
procedure
for
the
review
of
the
merits
of
federal
claims.
how
can
this
court
now,
by
refusing
to
apply
the
presumption
of
correctness
to
the
state
appellate
decision,
say
that
state
appellate
decisions
are
meaningless
when
this
court
itself
has
said
that
the
state
must
provide
meaningful
appellate
review?
there
are
compelling
reasons,
we
think,
for
extending
the
presumption
of
correctness
to
state
appellate
decisions.
first
of
all,
we
think
most
respectfully,
that
faye
versus
noya
underestimated
the
great
importance
of
finality
in
the
criminal
law.
we
think
that
state
court
decisions,
where
full
procedural
fairness
has
been
afforded
up
and
down
the
line,
ought
to
be
given
finality.
perhaps
a
most
important
reason
is
to
strengthen
public
confidence
in
the
administration
of
justice.
nothing
erodes
that
confidence
as
much
as
the
constant
litigation
and
re-litigation
and
re-litigation
again
of
claims
in
the
federal
courts
by
state
prisoners.
extending
the
presumption
of
state
appellate
decisions
will
encourage
state
appellate
courts
to
review
federal
claims
on
the
merits.
i
think
that
every
commentator
who
has
considered
the
matter
has
concluded
that
federal
claims
should
be
considered
on
the
merits
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
trial
has
been
completed.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
in
doing
the
trial,
too.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
at
the
first
opportunity
that
they’re
fairly
raised.
your
honor,
i
think
also
that
what
the
district
court
did
here
that
was
wrong
was
reviewing
this
state
trial
record
in
the
microscopic
examination
illuminated
by
the
glare
of
hindsight.
if
we--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
because
we
didn’t
think
it
was
a
ruling.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
we
didn’t
think
the
decision
in
this
court
was
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
now,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
rebut
counsel.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you,
your
honor.
i’ll
use
them
briefly
to
reply
to
counsel’s
argument.
he
lays
heavy
stress
on
alleged
inducements.
this
was,
i
think,
dispositively
answered
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
on
the
original
appeal.
moreover,
the
recorded
conversation
demonstrates--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i’m
reading
from--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
page
32
of
our
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
california
supreme
court
opinion,
i
believe,
is
also
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
but
i
can’t
find
it
now.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
moreover,
the
recorded
conversation
demonstrates
that
travers
referred
to
the
insurance
policy
to
explain
why
he
was
asking
questions
and
not
as
an
inducement
for
any
particular
answers.
the
trial
court
listened
to
the
tape
in
chambers
before
ruling
on
its
admissibility.
now,
as
far
as
the
counsel
point,
of
course,
if
johnson
versus
new
jersey
means
anything,
it
means
that
escobedo
and
miranda
are
not
retroactive.
moreover,
the
counsel
point
was
considered
as
a
circumstance
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
assessing
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
now,
counsel
argues
that
state
appellate
review
is
not
comparable
to
federal
habeas
corpus
because
of
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
i
would
answer
this.
that,
in
a
state
appellate
practice,
the
substantial
evidence
rule
does
not
come
into
play
at
all
until
there
has
been
an
original
determination
of
procedural
fairness.
in
other
words,
where
the
procedural
fairness
of
the
hearing
itself
is
challenged,
counsel-confrontation,
that
sort
of
thing,
where
those
things
are
challenged,
substantial
evidence
can’t
be
determined
until
the
procedural
questions
are
answered
and
this
is
roughly
analogous
to
what
congress
has
provided
in
2254
(d).
in
other
words,
state
hearings
are
to
be
given
finality
where
the
state
courts
have
afforded
substantial
procedural
fairness.
it
was
a
step
in
the
direction
of
what
professor
bator
proposed
in
his
law
review
article
which
we
cite
and
refer
to
in
our
briefs.
we
think
it
ought
to
be
adopted
by
this
court.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that,
in
the
ultimate,
the
ultimate
determination
is
this.
we
live
in
a
federal
system.
this
case
gives
the
court
an
opportunity
to
show
that
federalism
is
a
two-way
street.
state
courts
are
required
to
apply
federal
law.
state
judges
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution.
the
obligation
of
the
states
to
apply
the
constitution
ought
to
call
forth
from
this
court
a
corresponding
grant
of
confidence
in
the
state
courts
to
apply
it
correctly.
i
think,
from
an
examination
of
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
here,
it’s
obvious
that
the
constitution
was
correctly
applied
in
this
case,
and
we
respectfully
submit
the
matter.
