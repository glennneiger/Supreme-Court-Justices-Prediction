justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don’t
understand
your
observation
that
you
thought
the
amendment
to
2254
(d)
reflected
some
congressional
dissatisfaction
with
townsend
and
sain.
how
can
you
say
that
when
2254
(d)
enacts
all
of
the
standards
for
review
laid
down
in
townsend
and
sain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
not
a
congressional
acceptance
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
uses
the
identical
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn’t?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
criteria
any
different
from
those
laid
down
in
townsend
and
sain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
deleted
or
omitted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
the
better--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
granucci,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
there
with
some
question.
i
gather,
under
2244,
if
when
this
case
was
here
on
direct
review
back
in
366,
we
sustained
the
supreme
court
of
california.
then,
2250--
2244’s
amendment
would
have
precluded
what
happened
here
on
federal
habeas,
would
it
not?
now,
i--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
find
that,
in
your
brief,
you’ve
argued
that
our
disposition
back
in
366
was
tantamount
to
sustaining
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
we
said
there
was,
after
hearing
oral
argument
and
fully
examining
the
record,
we
conclude
that
the
totality
of
circumstances,
as
the
record
makes
the
manifest,
did
not
warrant
bringing
the
case
here.
accordingly,
the
writ
is
dismissed.
now,
as
to
some
reason,
you
haven’t
argued
that
that
was
a
substance
sustaining
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
can’t
you
argue
it
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
it’s
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
dismissed
the
writ.
we
didn’t
deny
it.
we
granted
the
writ.
we
didn’t
deny
certiorari.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
didn’t
dismiss
it
as
improvidently
granted.
we
didn’t
say
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
if
we
construe
this
as
having
passed
on
the
merits
and
reverse
on
that
ground,
are
you
going
to
be
offended?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i’m
just
surprised
you
haven’t
argued
it.
you
don’t
say
a
word
about
it
in
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don’t
really
want
to
win
this
case
then.
you
want
us
to
review
faye
and
noya
and
townsend
and
sain,
that’s
what
you’re
after.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
nothing
that
we
haven’t
already
done.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
they
acted
only
on
the
same
record
that
was
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
which
we
heard
oral
argument
which
we
are
fully
examining.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
still
get
back
to
my
original
question.
i
don’t
understand
why--
well,
yes,
i
guess
i
do.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
if
you
prefer
to
look
at
it
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i’ve
put
to
you.
didn’t
we
review
the
facts
from
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
say
we
did?
i
thought
you
said
we
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
ruling.
didn’t
we
say
we
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
hearing
oral
argument
and
fully
examining
the
record,
we
conclude
that
the
totality
of
circumstances,
as
the
record
makes
the
manifest,
didn’t
warrant
brining
the
case
here.
didn’t
we
say
that
we
had
fully
examined
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
didn’t
say
the
“improvidently
granted.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who’s
court?
that
was
the
construction
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i’m
right,
am
i
not,
mr.
legge,
that
the
decisions
here
in
habeas
were
only
on
the
state
court
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
same
record
that
we
had
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn’t
have
a
hearing.
i
mean,
they
had
no
evidentiary
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
in
the
district
court
that
hadn’t
already
happened
here
in
the
way
of
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
are
they
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather,
the
standard
of
voluntariness
under
our
johnson
decision
was
the
pre-miranda,
pre-escobedo
standard,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
you
mean
relevant
that
there
was
no
counsel
when
he
sought,
but
wasn’t
that
always
the
case
on
voluntariness
cases
before
miranda
and
escobedo?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn’t--
weren’t
those
relevant
considerations:
councilman,
vice,
the
recent
title
of
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
before
we
decided
miranda
and
escobedo?
