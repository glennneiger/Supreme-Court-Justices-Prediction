mr.
charles
a.
legge
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
apparent
major
thrust
of
the
state’s
argument
is
really
that
the
courts
of
appeal
of
a
state
should
substitute
their
appellate
processes
for
the
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
the
facts
which
had
been
required
by
this
court
and
also
required
by
congress.
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
court
should
exceed
to
the
decisions
of
the
state
in
the
same
way
as
it
would
its
own
fact
finding
processes.
i
think
the
answer
to
whether
it
should
is
a
resounding
“no,
it
should
not.”
federal
appellate
review--
correction,
state
appellate
review
cannot
constitute
a
substitute
for
a
review
of
the
facts
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
do
not
believe
you
did,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
the
ruling
of
the
court,
i
believe--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
you
said
the--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
those
words
were
there,
your
honor,
but
i
must
say
that
the
relief
granted
by
this
court
to
what
the
dismissal
of
the
certiorari
petition
as
improvidently
granted
has
in
many--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
i
believe
that
was
a
construction
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you’ve
wrestled
with
this
question
in
the
rogers
case,
and
have
gone
into
the
question
of
when
and
where
this
court
must
pass
upon
the
merits
of
a
decision
and
when
and
where
it
may
rule
a
certiorari
is
improvidently
granted.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
rule
we
can
gather,
that
the
bar
can
gather
from
those
cases,
that
if
you’ve
got
four,
you’ve
got
certiorari
and
you
can
dismiss
the
certiorari
as
being
improvidently
granted,
but
that
does
not
constitute
a
ruin
upon
the
merits
of
the
case.
now,
we
also
note
your
honor,
but
of
course,
since
that
case
was
first
before
this
court,
we
have
had
the
decisions
of
jackson
v.
denno.
we’ve
had
decisions
of
escobedo.
we’ve
had
decisions
of
miranda.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
that’s
quite
correct,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
that’s
quite
correct
because
you
granted
the
remedy
that
the
district
court
granted
was
“let’s
have
a
hearing.
let’s
determine
the
facts.”
now,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
no,
this
is
what
the
district
court
granted.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
in
the
way
of
argument,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
can’t
say
that.
i
can’t.
we
do
not
represent
the
council
before
this
court.
we
were
rec--
we
were
appointed
in
1967
so
i
can’t
say
what
was
done,
but
i
do
wish
to
simply
conclude
my
response
to
your
question
were
a
mere
statement
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
a
prior
review
of
this
matter
constituted
a
ruling
upon
the
merits
of
it.
now,
if
i
may
return,
that
the
states
may
not--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i’m--
merits
of
any
of
it.
this
court
decided
that,
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
a
matter
of
total
review,
that
the
granting
of
certiorari
had
been
improvident
and
it
reversed
that
grant
of
certiorari.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
cannot
answer
the
question,
mr.
justice
white,
because
we
did
not
represent
him
in
that
prior.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
have
made
an
attempt
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
we
do
find
that
there
are
questions
presented
of
voluntariness.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
certainly.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
certainly.
mr.
charles

legge
the
denial
of
counsel,
the
jackson
v.
denno
case,
and
the
application
of
miranda
and
escobedo
retroactively
back
to
the
time
of
his
confession.
now
those
are,
of
course,
matters
that
were
brought
before
the
district
court
that
were
not
before
this
court
the
first
time.
mr.
charles

legge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles

yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
on
the
same
factual
record,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
this
court
has
said
that,
in
evaluating
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession,
that
escobedo
and
miranda
are
retroactive.
mr.
charles

i’m
sorry,

mr.

have
been.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
they
may
have
been,
but
certainly
sharpened
by
miranda
and
sharpened
by
escobedo.
now
your
honor,
if
i
may
return
to
what
i
believe
is
the
state’s
main
thrust
here
and
that
is
that
they
want
federal
appellate--
state
appellate
review
to
have
a
dignity
of
fact
finding
as
required
by
this
court
and
required
by
congress
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
habeas
corpus.
i
do
not
believe
that
state
appellate
review
can
ever
perform
the
function
of
the
fact
finding
that’s
required
by
this
court
and
required
by
congress.
the
first
point
is
this.
in
state
appellate
review,
you
have
a
principle
of
substantial
evidence.
now,
the
states
says
it’s
an
initial
review,
but
it
is
still
an
initial
review
based
with
a
substantial
evidence
rule,
and
i
cite
for
that
a
1970
case
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
defines
the
scope
of
its
appellate
review
of
confession
cases.
this
is
people
versus
randall
cited
in
1
cal
3rd
948,
and
i
wish
to
quote
from
page
954
of
that
opinion
just
very
briefly.
“on
this
appeal,
we
accept
the
version
of
the
events
which
is
most
favorable
to
the
people,
to
the
extent
it
is
supported
by
record,
and
confine
our
review
beyond
such
testimony
to
facts
which
are
uncontradicted
by
the
people.
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
by
any
proper
definition,
that
is
a
substantial
evidence
rule,
and
that
substantial
evidence
rule
had
its
impact
in
this
case.
because
of
your
honors’
review,
the
language
of
the
state
court
opinion,
you
will
find
that
the
facts
are
essentially
the
facts
that
were
stated
in
the
recorded
confession.
now,
appellate
review
statement--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
there
were
material
differences
that
were
referred
to
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
however,
i
am
here
to
state
the
point
in
comparing
state
appellate
review
versus
a
fact
finding
process
which
we--
what
believe
is
required
on
habeas
corpus.
that,
this
is
an
example
of
how
it
works
that,
the
state
picks
up
in
its
opinion
those
facts
which
are
most
favorable
to
the
people,
assuming
of
course
that
there
had
been
a
conviction.
now,
you
combine
that
substantial
evidence
rule
with
a
harmless
error
rule
on
appeal,
and
this
is
exactly
what
happened
to
mr.
atchley
in
this
case.
the
california
supreme
court
says
he
didn’t
have
a
lawyer.
that
was
error
for
the
judge
to
stop
that
testimony,
but
it
was
harmless
error.
so,
you
have
a
substantial
evidence
rule,
you
have
a
harmless
error
rule,
and
of
course
you
have
the
fact
also
that
the
appellate
courts
have
no
facility
for
taking
evidence.
so--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
no,
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
at
all,
your
honor.
i
am
responding
to
the
state’s
contention
that
the
state
of
california’s
appellate
review
on
direct
appeal
from
a
conviction
forecloses
us
from
raising
these
fact
finding
determinations
in
the
district
court.
that’s
what
i’m
replying
to
and
what
i’m
stating
are
the
reasons
why
state
appellate
review
can
be
no
substitute
for
a
fact
finding
process.
i
believe
this
court
has
said
the
same
thing.
in
jackson
against
denno,
it
said
when
facts
are
important,
appellate
review
is
an
inadequate
substitute
for
a
trial
court
hearing.
so,
what
i
think
we
have
is
this,
your
honor.
if
there
is
going
to
be
examination
into
the
constitutionality
of
convictions,
there
has
to
be
the
fact
finding
process
so
that
matters
that
are
extraneous
to
the
record
can
be
brought
in
so
that
they
can
be
a
value,
so
their
constitutional
significance
can
be
weighed,
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
state
court--
appellate
opinion
could
ever
satisfy
that
function.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
you
mean
in
our
case
or
hypothetically?
mr.
charles
a.
legge
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
facts
that
we
would
bring
in
would
be
the
facts
which
were
admitted
from
evidence
by
the
state
court.
for
example,
the
fact
of
no
lawyer.
for
example,
testimony
between
mr.
travers
who
obtained
the
recording
with
the
state
police
officer.
facts
pertaining
to
mr.
atchley’s
mental
and
physical
condition,
facts
which
were
not
brought
forth
in
the
record
and
which
should’ve
been
brought
forth
in
the
record
and
on
a
new
evidentiary
hearing
will
be
brought
forth
in
the
record.
to
broaden
it
up
a
little
bit
beyond
this
case,
to
respond
to
your
honor’s
question
in
that
matter,
take
the
classic
search
and
seizure
case
where
a
defendant
objects
that
certain
evidence
used
at
his
trial
was
improperly
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
of
course,
that
kind
of
saying
would
very
rarely
ever
be
in
the
transcript
of
a
state
court
hearing.
you
could
only
develop
that
kind
of
saying
in
a
vast
majority
of
cases
by
having
the
hearing
into
factual
determinations
made
by
a
federal
court.
now,
your
honors,
we
have
here
in
this
case
the
coming
together
of
really
three
fundamental
rights
which
the
court
has
long
protected.
these
are
the
problems
surrounding
confessions,
the
right
of
an
accused
to
an
attorney
and
the
right
of
an
accused
to
a
fair
hearing
on
whatever
merits,
on
whatever
issues
he
raises
in
connection
with
this
trial
on
the
merits.
now,
this
case--
this
court
has
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
and
attention
in
past
decisions
to
its
confession
cases.
it’s
expressed
itself
time
and
again
the
importance
of
confession
cases
to
the
administration
of
justice,
and
it
has
also
gone
to
the
point
of
making
its
confession
cases
retroactive,
which
is
significant.
with
respect
to
the
right
to
an
attorney,
some
references
were
made
by
the
state’s
attorney
to
whether
mr.
atchley
had
access
to
one
or
not.
we
believe
that
the
record
is
patently
clear
and,
in
fact,
undenied
that
he
requested
a
lawyer
and
did
not
receive
one.
i’m
reading
from
189-190
of
the
record.
question:
how
many
times
did
you
ask
for
a
lawyer,
would
you
say?
answer:
i
would
say
i
asked
for
a
lawyer
10
times.
question:
and
you
asked
how
many
people?
answer:
well,
everyone
that
i
talked
to,
i
still
ask
them
for
a
lawyer.
referring
to
page
206
of
the
transcript
where
mr.
atchley
is
under
examination
by
the
state’s
attorney.
mr.
atchley
says
this,
“as
i
said,
i
asked
for
counsel
about
8
or
10
times
when
i
got
down
here
where
i
can
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth,
and
new
orleans
wouldn’t
give
me
one.”
now,
there
is
no--
mr.
charles
a.

pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
charles

trial

mr.

mr.
charles

legge
it
doesn’t
say,
no.
but,
certainly,
i
think
you
can
state
this,
that
when
he
asks
repeatedly,
when
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
didn’t
get
it,
and
when
he
is
represented
at
the
trial
of
his
case
by
court-appointed
counsel,
i
think
it’s
undeniably
clear.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
it’s
undeniably
clear
that
the
man
was
asking
for
a
lawyer
to
be
appointed
for
him.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
the
record
can
say--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
the
record,
i
don’t
believe,
your
honor,
contains
any
language
to
the
effect
of
whether
he
did
or
did
not,
but
i
would
say
this.
that
it
is
this
evidence
that
was
blocked
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
did
not
permit
any
testimony
to
be
introduced
on
the
subject
of
an
attorney
because
the
trial
court
says
this--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
and
the
trial
court
says
you
can’t
even
hear
it.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
my
answer
to
that
is
it
is
not
a
harmless
error.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
because
of
escobedo
and
miranda.
these
are
very
valid,
very
important
constitutional
rights
which
have
been
applied
retroactively
in
confession
situations.
you
have
here
the
coming
together
of
two
rights,
protection
for
involuntary
confession
and
the
right
to
a
lawyer.
in
fact,
we
think
that
that
coming
to
clear--
together
is
so
clear
that
this
court
should
rule
that
the
confession
is
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
but,
at
the
very
least,
we
should
be
entitled
to
that
evidentiary
hearing
where
the
evidence
blocked
by
the
trial
court
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
need
for
a
lawyer,
questions

mr.
justice
mar--
mr.
charles

it
may
have
done
so.
it
may
have
passed
up
the
opportunity.
we
don’t
think
we’re
foreclosed
from
asking
this
court
to
do
it.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
they
have
been
ret--applied
retroactively,
your
honor,
to
the
subject
of
confessions.
we
have
cite
these
cases

page
14
of
our
brief.
they
have
darwin

connecticut,
johnson
against
new

and
davis

the
courts
hold--
mr.

retroactively
to
the
relevance
and
to
the
substance
of
whether
a
confession
is
or
is
not
voluntary.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
it
may
have
always
been
the
rule.
the
case
certainly
states
the
rule.
i
need
not
argue
whether
it
had
been
that
rule
or
not

mr.
charles

i’m

i’m

mr.

these
specific
cases,

mr.
charles

legge
i
can’t
respond
to
the
cases,
your
honor,
because
we--
neither
the
state

i
have
considered
them
in
our
briefs
here.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
what
mr.
travers
did
not
directly
testify
in
this
record
to
what
mr.
atchley
told
him,
and
i
assume
that
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
this,
that
suppose
the
recorded
confession
were
just
lifted
from
the
transcript
and
placed
aside
and
you
had
left
was
travers’
oral
testimony,
would
that
be
a
confession?
and,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
i’m
satisfied
that
the--
all
they
used
travers
for
was
to
lay
the
foundation,
the
evidentiary
foundation,
for
the
introduction
of
the
confession.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
with
the
defendant’s
testimony
following
after
the
confession,
that
is
after
the
confession
is
played
to
the
jury,
you
have
a
circumstance,
your
honor,
where
“what
can
he
do?”
“what
can
he
say?”
now,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
many,
many
of
them
say
that
regardless
of
other
evidence,
regardless
of
how
many
other
confessions
there
may
be,
regardless
of
independent
evidence
of
guilt,
that
if
there
is
an
involuntary
confession,
the
conviction
is
improper.
now,
i
would
certainly
say,
your
honor,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
defendants
testimony
here
in
trial
to
constitute
a
confession.
mr.
charles

the
ultimate--
the
best
ultimate
relief

can
get,
your
honor,
is
a
new
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
1958
or
1959.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
believe
so,
1958
or
1959.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
that’s
quite
true,
your
honor.
that’s
quite
true,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
mere
passage
of
time
should
have
the
effect
of
eliminating
constitutional
violations.
we
have--
this
court
has
a
certain
control
over
that
also
in
connection
with
the
decisions
which
it
decides
to
make
retroactive
and
those
which
it
does
not
make
retroactive.
and,
it
is
declared
that
it
is
johnson
v.--
or
it’s
jackson
v.
denno
decisions
are
going
to
be
retroactive
in
their
application.
so,
we
think
once
the
court
has
said
that,
that
just
passage
of
years,
the
number
of
years
that
have
passed
is
not
enough
to
eliminate
the
existence
of
a
right.
your
honor,
i
would
reply
to
one
further
argument
made
by
the
state,
and
that
is
in
connection
with
the
jackson
versus
denno
principle.
the
state
makes
the
argument
that
the
trial
judge’s
near
admission
of
this
confession
into
evidence
constituted
enough
of
a
ruling
upon
the
subject
of
voluntariness
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
jackson
v.
denno.
we
would
first
point
out,
your
honors,
that
the
introduction
of
the
confession
into
evidence
was
not
enough
in
the
sims
case,
sims
against
georgia,
was
not
enough
in
boles
against
stevenson,
and
was
not
enough
in
parker
versus
sigler
to
constitute
rulings
by
the
trial
judge.
it’s
sort
of
a
fortiori
to
the
boles
versus
stevenson
decision
because,
at
that
decision,
the
procedure
followed
in
that
is
a
so-called
orthodox
procedure
where
the
jury
has
no
function
in
finding
voluntariness
at
all.
i
would
also
cite
to
the
court,
in
that
regard,
that
sims
required
unmistakable
clarity
of
a
ruling
by
the
trial
judge.
now
here,
however,
the
argument--
the
decision
in
ruling
made
by
the
trial
judge
was
all
tied
in
with
the
evidence--
with
20
pages
of
evidentiary
material
and,
we
submit,
could
only
be
confusing
at
the
utmost
when
admitted
into
evidence
before
the
jury.
now,
your
honors,
there’s
another
element
to
the
case
which
we
think
is
significant
and
is
important,
and
that
is
the
inducement
underlying
this
confession.
there
is
the
fact
that
the
reason
why
mr.
travers
was
talking
to
mr.
atchley
was
that
he
needed
facts
for
purposes
of
insurance
coverage
set
on
page
100,
and
this
is
a
portion
of
the
transcribed
conversation
between
travers
and
atchley.
mr.
travers
says,
“boy
oh
boy,
you
got
your
cigarettes.
i
got
to
write
this
up
to
the
company.
we
got
to
think
of
the
children.
i
want
this
information.”
and
then,
he
proceeds
with
his
interrogation
of
mr.
atchley.
again,
on
page
102
of
the
record,
tarvers
says
“i
say,
100%
as
far
as
the
policy.
i
am
almost
positive.”
so,
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
a
confession
cannot
be
the
product
of
any
inducement
at
all,
and
i
think
here,
your
honor,
that
the
inducement
is
very
specific,
“insurance
money.”
now,
what
consequences
should
flow
from
all
of
this?
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
page
102
and
page
100
of
the--
what
i
just
quoted
are
from
the
recoding
of
the
conversation,
that
is
the
so-called
confession
that
is
in
dispute
here.
the
consequences,
your
honor,
that
we
think
should
flow
from
all
of
these
are
this.
we,
first
of
all,
respectfully
submit
that
because
of
the
denial
of
counsel
in
this
case,
that
this
confession
should
be
determined
to
be
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
mr.
atchley
should
be
accorded
a
new
trial.
we
believe
that
the
court
has
come
close
to
this,
if
not
actually
doing
it,
in
its
decisions
in
the
greenwald
and
darwin
case,
and
we
believe
that
it
has
in
fact
done
it
in
the
massiah
decision.
the
spano
decision,
of
course,
is
quite
relevant
to
it
too.
we
feel
that
when
these
two
interests
of
protecting
against
involuntary
confessions
with
the
right
to
counsel
come
together
that
that,
in
it
of
itself,
should
be
enough
for
a
confession
to
be
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
addition,
of
course,
to
the
absence
of
an
attorney,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
numerous
other
factors
involved
in
this
confession.
he
was
not
being
advised
of
his
rights,
the
inducement
of
the
insurance
money,
his
personal
intelligence,
or
i
should
say
lack
of
intelligence
and
capacity
to
resist,
and
the
other
factors
mentioned.
now,
at
the
very
least,
your
honors,
because
of
the
procedural
inequities
in
that
the
state
court
hearing
on
a
confession,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed
and
that
atchley
should
be
given
the
evidentiary
hearing
which
the
district
court
said
he
should
have.
so
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
confession
is
either
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
and
should
result
in
a
new
trial
or,
at
the
very
least,
that
mr.
atchley
should
be
given
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
state
courts
that
was
awarded
to
him
by
the
district
court.
mr.
charles

i
understand
that
he
is
deceased,
your

mr.
charles

it
would,
but
i
think,
your

that
that
is
what
the
habeas

statute
requires
anyway,
and
i
think
that’s
what
this
court’s
decision
in
faye
against
noya
and
townsend
against
sain
are
requiring.
mr.

this

mr.

opportunity
to
reply
to
what
i
say
in
the
event
if
what
i
say
about
their
advice
to

is
inaccurate.
of
course,
as
the
case
proceeds,
your
honors,
we
all
discuss,
counsels
discuss.
how
can
we
move
the
case?
is
there
some
together
alternative
besides
proceeding
along
with
the
litigation?
one
of
the
suggested
alternatives,
well,
what’s
going
to
happen
with
the
case?
if
we
have
the
evidentiary
hearing,
are
the
witnesses
available?
if
we
have
the
retrial,
are
there
witnesses
available?
i
have
been
advised
by
one
of
the
state’s
attorneys
that
mr.
travers
is
still
available.
mr.
travers
would,
of
course,
be
probably
the
key
witness
other
than
the
defendant
in
this
case.
i
believe
he
is
available.
as
to
the
availability
of
the
other
witnesses,
i
simply
can’t
answer
for
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
apparent
major
thrust
of
the
state’s
argument
is
really
that
the
courts
of
appeal
of
a
state
should
substitute
their
appellate
processes
for
the
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
the
facts
which
had
been
required
by
this
court
and
also
required
by
congress.
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
court
should
exceed
to
the
decisions
of
the
state
in
the
same
way
as
it
would
its
own
fact
finding
processes.
i
think
the
answer
to
whether
it
should
is
a
resounding
“no,
it
should
not.”
federal
appellate
review--
correction,
state
appellate
review
cannot
constitute
a
substitute
for
a
review
of
the
facts
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
do
not
believe
you
did,
your

mr.

the
ruling

mr.

you
said
the--
mr.
charles

yes,
those
words
were
there,
your
honor,
but
i
must
say
that
the
relief
granted
by
this
court
to
what
the
dismissal
of
the
certiorari
petition
as
improvidently
granted
has
in
many--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
i
believe
that
was
a
construction
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you’ve
wrestled
with
this
question
in
the
rogers
case,
and
have
gone
into
the
question
of
when
and
where
this
court
must
pass
upon
the
merits
of
a
decision
and
when
and
where
it
may
rule
a
certiorari
is
improvidently
granted.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
rule
we
can
gather,
that
the
bar
can
gather
from
those
cases,
that
if
you’ve
got
four,
you’ve
got
certiorari
and
you
can
dismiss
the
certiorari
as
being
improvidently
granted,
but
that
does
not
constitute
a
ruin
upon
the
merits
of
the
case.
now,
we
also
note
your
honor,
but
of
course,
since
that
case
was
first
before
this
court,
we
have
had
the
decisions
of
jackson
v.
denno.
we’ve
had
decisions
of
escobedo.
we’ve
had
decisions
of
miranda.
mr.
charles

that’s
quite
correct,
yes.
mr.
charles

yes,
that’s
quite
correct
because
you
granted
the
remedy
that
the
district

granted
was
“let’s
have
a
hearing.
let’s
determine
the
facts.”
now,
i--
mr.
charles

legge
no,
this
is
what
the
district

granted.
mr.
charles

in
the
way
of
argument,

mr.
charles

can’t

that.
i

we
do
not
represent
the

we
were
appointed
in
1967
so
i
can’t
say
what
was
done,
but
i
do
wish
to
simply
conclude
my
response
to
your
question
were
a
mere
statement
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
a
prior
review
of
this
matter
constituted
a
ruling
upon
the
merits
of
it.
now,
if
i
may
return,
that
the
states
may
not--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i’m--
merits
of
any
of
it.
this
court
decided
that,
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
a
matter
of
total
review,
that
the
granting
of
certiorari
had
been
improvident
and
it
reversed
that
grant
of
certiorari.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
cannot
answer
the
question,
mr.
justice
white,
because
we
did
not
represent
him
in
that

mr.

have
made
an
attempt

do
so.
mr.

voluntariness.
mr.

mr.

case,
and
the
application
of
miranda

the
time
of
his
confession.
now
those
are,
of
course,
matters
that
were
brought
before
the
district
court
that
were
not
before
this
court
the
first

now
your
honor,
if
i
may
return
to
what
i
believe
is
the
state’s
main
thrust
here
and
that
is
that
they
want
federal
appellate--
state
appellate
review
to
have
a
dignity
of
fact
finding
as
required
by
this
court
and
required
by
congress
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
habeas
corpus.
i
do
not
believe
that
state
appellate
review
can
ever
perform
the
function
of
the
fact
finding
that’s
required
by
this
court
and
required
by
congress.
the
first
point
is
this.
in
state
appellate
review,
you
have
a
principle
of
substantial
evidence.
now,
the
states
says
it’s
an
initial
review,
but
it
is
still
an
initial
review
based
with
a
substantial
evidence
rule,
and
i
cite
for
that
a
1970
case
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
defines
the
scope
of
its
appellate
review
of
confession
cases.
this
is
people
versus
randall
cited
in
1
cal
3rd
948,
and
i
wish
to
quote
from
page
954
of
that
opinion
just
very
briefly.
“on
this
appeal,
we
accept
the
version
of
the
events
which
is
most
favorable
to
the
people,
to
the
extent
it
is
supported
by
record,
and
confine
our
review
beyond
such
testimony
to
facts
which
are
uncontradicted
by
the
people.
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
by
any
proper
definition,
that
is
a
substantial
evidence
rule,
and
that
substantial
evidence
rule
had
its
impact
in
this
case.
because
of
your
honors’
review,
the
language
of
the
state
court
opinion,
you
will
find
that
the
facts
are
essentially
the
facts
that
were
stated
in
the
recorded
confession.
now,
appellate
review
statement--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
there
were
material
differences
that
were
referred
to
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
however,
i
am
here
to
state
the
point
in
comparing
state
appellate
review
versus
a
fact
finding
process
which
we--
what
believe
is
required
on
habeas
corpus.
that,
this
is
an
example
of
how
it
works
that,
the
state
picks
up
in
its
opinion
those
facts
which
are
most
favorable
to
the
people,
assuming
of
course
that
there
had
been
a
conviction.
now,
you
combine
that
substantial
evidence
rule
with
a
harmless
error
rule
on
appeal,
and
this
is
exactly
what
happened
to
mr.
atchley
in
this
case.
the
california
supreme
court
says
he
didn’t
have
a
lawyer.
that
was
error
for
the
judge
to
stop
that
testimony,
but
it
was
harmless
error.
so,
you
have
a
substantial
evidence
rule,
you
have
a
harmless
error
rule,
and
of
course
you
have
the
fact
also
that
the
appellate
courts
have
no
facility
for
taking
evidence.
so--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
no,
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
at
all,
your
honor.
i
am
responding
to
the
state’s
contention
that
the
state
of
california’s
appellate
review
on
direct
appeal
from
a
conviction
forecloses
us
from
raising
these
fact
finding
determinations
in
the
district
court.
that’s
what
i’m
replying
to
and
what
i’m
stating
are
the
reasons
why
state
appellate
review
can
be
no
substitute
for
a
fact
finding
process.
i
believe
this
court
has
said
the
same
thing.
in
jackson
against
denno,
it
said
when
facts
are
important,
appellate
review
is
an
inadequate
substitute
for
a
trial
court
hearing.
so,
what
i
think
we
have
is
this,
your
honor.
if
there
is
going
to
be
examination
into
the
constitutionality
of
convictions,
there
has
to
be
the
fact
finding
process
so
that
matters
that
are
extraneous
to
the
record
can
be
brought
in
so
that
they
can
be
a
value,
so
their
constitutional
significance
can
be
weighed,
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
state
court--
appellate
opinion
could
ever
satisfy
that
function.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
you
mean
in
our
case
or
hypothetically?
mr.
charles
a.
legge
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
facts
that
we
would
bring
in
would
be
the
facts
which
were
admitted
from
evidence
by
the
state
court.
for
example,
the
fact
of
no
lawyer.
for
example,
testimony
between
mr.
travers
who
obtained
the
recording
with
the
state
police
officer.
facts
pertaining
to
mr.
atchley’s
mental
and
physical
condition,
facts
which
were
not
brought
forth
in
the
record
and
which
should’ve
been
brought
forth
in
the
record
and
on
a
new
evidentiary
hearing
will
be
brought
forth
in
the
record.
to
broaden
it
up
a
little
bit
beyond
this
case,
to
respond
to
your
honor’s
question
in
that
matter,
take
the
classic
search
and
seizure
case
where
a
defendant
objects
that
certain
evidence
used
at
his
trial
was
improperly
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
of
course,
that
kind
of
saying
would
very
rarely
ever
be
in
the
transcript
of
a
state
court
hearing.
you
could
only
develop
that
kind
of
saying
in
a
vast
majority
of
cases
by
having
the
hearing
into
factual
determinations
made
by
a
federal
court.
now,
your
honors,
we
have
here
in
this
case
the
coming
together
of
really
three
fundamental
rights
which
the
court
has
long
protected.
these
are
the
problems
surrounding
confessions,
the
right
of
an
accused
to
an
attorney
and
the
right
of
an
accused
to
a
fair
hearing
on
whatever
merits,
on
whatever
issues
he
raises
in
connection
with
this
trial
on
the
merits.
now,
this
case--
this
court
has
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
and
attention
in
past
decisions
to
its
confession
cases.
it’s
expressed
itself
time
and
again
the
importance
of
confession
cases
to
the
administration
of
justice,
and
it
has
also
gone
to
the
point
of
making
its
confession
cases
retroactive,
which
is
significant.
with
respect
to
the
right
to
an
attorney,
some
references
were
made
by
the
state’s
attorney
to
whether
mr.
atchley
had
access
to
one
or
not.
we
believe
that
the
record
is
patently
clear
and,
in
fact,
undenied
that
he
requested
a
lawyer
and
did
not
receive
one.
i’m
reading
from
189-190
of
the
record.
question:
how
many
times
did
you
ask
for
a
lawyer,
would
you
say?
answer:
i
would
say
i
asked
for
a
lawyer
10
times.
question:
and
you
asked
how
many
people?
answer:
well,
everyone
that
i
talked
to,
i
still
ask
them
for
a
lawyer.
referring
to
page
206
of
the
transcript
where
mr.
atchley
is
under
examination
by
the
state’s
attorney.
mr.
atchley
says
this,
“as
i
said,
i
asked
for
counsel
about
8
or
10
times
when
i
got
down
here
where
i
can
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth,
and
new
orleans
wouldn’t
give
me
one.”
now,
there
is
no--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
legge
he
was
represented
in
the
trial
of
his
case
by
a
court-appointed
attorney.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
he
asked
for--
yes,
he
asked
to
have--
he
asked
the
police
to
provide
him
with
a
lawyer.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
for
what,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
the
record
doesn’t
say,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
it
doesn’t
say,
no.
but,
certainly,
i
think
you
can
state
this,
that
when
he
asks
repeatedly,
when
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
didn’t
get
it,
and
when
he
is
represented
at
the
trial
of
his
case
by
court-appointed
counsel,
i
think
it’s
undeniably
clear.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
it’s
undeniably
clear
that
the
man
was
asking
for
a
lawyer
to
be
appointed
for
him.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
the
record
can
say--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
the
record,
i
don’t
believe,
your
honor,
contains
any
language
to
the
effect
of
whether
he
did
or
did
not,
but
i
would
say
this.
that
it
is
this
evidence
that
was
blocked
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
did
not
permit
any
testimony
to
be
introduced
on
the
subject
of
an
attorney
because
the
trial
court
says
this--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
and
the
trial
court
says
you
can’t
even
hear
it.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
my
answer
to
that
is
it
is
not
a
harmless
error.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
because
of
escobedo
and
miranda.
these
are
very
valid,
very
important
constitutional
rights
which
have
been
applied
retroactively
in
confession
situations.
you
have
here
the
coming
together
of
two
rights,
protection
for
involuntary
confession
and
the
right
to
a
lawyer.
in
fact,
we
think
that
that
coming
to
clear--
together
is
so
clear
that
this
court
should
rule
that
the
confession
is
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
but,
at
the
very
least,
we
should
be
entitled
to
that
evidentiary
hearing
where
the
evidence
blocked
by
the
trial
court
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
need
for
a
lawyer,
questions
that
mr.
justice
mar--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
it
may
have
done
so.
it
may
have
passed
up
the
opportunity.
we
don’t
think
we’re
foreclosed
from
asking
this
court
to
do
it.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
they
have
been
ret--applied
retroactively,
your
honor,
to
the
subject
of
confessions.
we
have
cite
these
cases
on
page
14
of
our
brief.
they
have
darwin
against
connecticut,
johnson
against
new
jersey,
and
davis
against
north
carolina.
the
courts
hold--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
retroactively
to
the
relevance
and
to
the
substance
of
whether
a
confession
is
or
is
not
voluntary.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
it
may
have
always
been
the
rule.
the
case
certainly
states
the
rule.
i
need
not
argue
whether
it
had
been
that
rule
or
not
before.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i’m
not--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
can’t
respond
to
these
specific
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
can’t
respond
to
the
cases,
your
honor,
because
we--
neither
the
state
nor
i
have
considered
them
in
our
briefs
here.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
what
mr.
travers
did
not
directly
testify
in
this
record
to
what
mr.
atchley
told
him,
and
i
assume
that
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
this,
that
suppose
the
recorded
confession
were
just
lifted
from
the
transcript
and
placed
aside
and
you
had
left
was
travers’
oral
testimony,
would
that
be
a
confession?
and,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
i’m
satisfied
that
the--
all
they
used
travers
for
was
to
lay
the
foundation,
the
evidentiary
foundation,
for
the
introduction
of
the
confession.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
with
the
defendant’s
testimony
following
after
the
confession,
that
is
after
the
confession
is
played
to
the
jury,
you
have
a
circumstance,
your
honor,
where
“what
can
he
do?”
“what
can
he
say?”
now,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
many,
many
of
them
say
that
regardless
of
other
evidence,
regardless
of
how
many
other
confessions
there
may
be,
regardless
of
independent
evidence
of
guilt,
that
if
there
is
an
involuntary
confession,
the
conviction
is
improper.
now,
i
would
certainly
say,
your
honor,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
defendants
testimony
here
in
trial
to
constitute
a
confession.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
the
ultimate--
the
best
ultimate
relief
we
can
get,
your
honor,
is
a
new
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
1958
or
1959.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
believe
so,
1958
or
1959.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
that’s
quite
true,
your
honor.
that’s
quite
true,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
mere
passage
of
time
should
have
the
effect
of
eliminating
constitutional
violations.
we
have--
this
court
has
a
certain
control
over
that
also
in
connection
with
the
decisions
which
it
decides
to
make
retroactive
and
those
which
it
does
not
make
retroactive.
and,
it
is
declared
that
it
is
johnson
v.--
or
it’s
jackson
v.
denno
decisions
are
going
to
be
retroactive
in
their
application.
so,
we
think
once
the
court
has
said
that,
that
just
passage
of
years,
the
number
of
years
that
have
passed
is
not
enough
to
eliminate
the
existence
of
a
right.
your
honor,
i
would
reply
to
one
further
argument
made
by
the
state,
and
that
is
in
connection
with
the
jackson
versus
denno
principle.
the
state
makes
the
argument
that
the
trial
judge’s
near
admission
of
this
confession
into
evidence
constituted
enough
of
a
ruling
upon
the
subject
of
voluntariness
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
jackson
v.
denno.
we
would
first
point
out,
your
honors,
that
the
introduction
of
the
confession
into
evidence
was
not
enough
in
the
sims
case,
sims
against
georgia,
was
not
enough
in
boles
against
stevenson,
and
was
not
enough
in
parker
versus
sigler
to
constitute
rulings
by
the
trial
judge.
it’s
sort
of
a
fortiori
to
the
boles
versus
stevenson
decision
because,
at
that
decision,
the
procedure
followed
in
that
is
a
so-called
orthodox
procedure
where
the
jury
has
no
function
in
finding
voluntariness
at
all.
i
would
also
cite
to
the
court,
in
that
regard,
that
sims
required
unmistakable
clarity
of
a
ruling
by
the
trial
judge.
now
here,
however,
the
argument--
the
decision
in
ruling
made
by
the
trial
judge
was
all
tied
in
with
the
evidence--
with
20
pages
of
evidentiary
material
and,
we
submit,
could
only
be
confusing
at
the
utmost
when
admitted
into
evidence
before
the
jury.
now,
your
honors,
there’s
another
element
to
the
case
which
we
think
is
significant
and
is
important,
and
that
is
the
inducement
underlying
this
confession.
there
is
the
fact
that
the
reason
why
mr.
travers
was
talking
to
mr.
atchley
was
that
he
needed
facts
for
purposes
of
insurance
coverage
set
on
page
100,
and
this
is
a
portion
of
the
transcribed
conversation
between
travers
and
atchley.
mr.
travers
says,
“boy
oh
boy,
you
got
your
cigarettes.
i
got
to
write
this
up
to
the
company.
we
got
to
think
of
the
children.
i
want
this
information.”
and
then,
he
proceeds
with
his
interrogation
of
mr.
atchley.
again,
on
page
102
of
the
record,
tarvers
says
“i
say,
100%
as
far
as
the
policy.
i
am
almost
positive.”
so,
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
a
confession
cannot
be
the
product
of
any
inducement
at
all,
and
i
think
here,
your
honor,
that
the
inducement
is
very
specific,
“insurance
money.”
now,
what
consequences
should
flow
from
all
of
this?
mr.
charles
a.
legge
yes,
page
102
and
page
100
of
the--
what
i
just
quoted
are
from
the
recoding
of
the
conversation,
that
is
the
so-called
confession
that
is
in
dispute
here.
the
consequences,
your
honor,
that
we
think
should
flow
from
all
of
these
are
this.
we,
first
of
all,
respectfully
submit
that
because
of
the
denial
of
counsel
in
this
case,
that
this
confession
should
be
determined
to
be
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
mr.
atchley
should
be
accorded
a
new
trial.
we
believe
that
the
court
has
come
close
to
this,
if
not
actually
doing
it,
in
its
decisions
in
the
greenwald
and
darwin
case,
and
we
believe
that
it
has
in
fact
done
it
in
the
massiah
decision.
the
spano
decision,
of
course,
is
quite
relevant
to
it
too.
we
feel
that
when
these
two
interests
of
protecting
against
involuntary
confessions
with
the
right
to
counsel
come
together
that
that,
in
it
of
itself,
should
be
enough
for
a
confession
to
be
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law.
in
addition,
of
course,
to
the
absence
of
an
attorney,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
numerous
other
factors
involved
in
this
confession.
he
was
not
being
advised
of
his
rights,
the
inducement
of
the
insurance
money,
his
personal
intelligence,
or
i
should
say
lack
of
intelligence
and
capacity
to
resist,
and
the
other
factors
mentioned.
now,
at
the
very
least,
your
honors,
because
of
the
procedural
inequities
in
that
the
state
court
hearing
on
a
confession,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed
and
that
atchley
should
be
given
the
evidentiary
hearing
which
the
district
court
said
he
should
have.
so
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
confession
is
either
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
and
should
result
in
a
new
trial
or,
at
the
very
least,
that
mr.
atchley
should
be
given
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
state
courts
that
was
awarded
to
him
by
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
i
understand
that
he
is
deceased,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
it
would,
but
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is
what
the
habeas
corpus
statute
requires
anyway,
and
i
think
that’s
what
this
court’s
decision
in
faye
against
noya
and
townsend
against
sain
are
requiring.
mr.
charles
a.
legge
could
this
case
be
retried?
well--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
are
you--
well--
mr.
charles
a.
legge
well,
i
can
say
this,
and
the
state’s
attorney
will
have
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
what
i
say
in
the
event
if
what
i
say
about
their
advice
to
me
is
inaccurate.
of
course,
as
the
case
proceeds,
your
honors,
we
all
discuss,
counsels
discuss.
how
can
we
move
the
case?
is
there
some
together
alternative
besides
proceeding
along
with
the
litigation?
one
of
the
suggested
alternatives,
well,
what’s
going
to
happen
with
the
case?
if
we
have
the
evidentiary
hearing,
are
the
witnesses
available?
if
we
have
the
retrial,
are
there
witnesses
available?
i
have
been
advised
by
one
of
the
state’s
attorneys
that
mr.
travers
is
still
available.
mr.
travers
would,
of
course,
be
probably
the
key
witness
other
than
the
defendant
in
this
case.
i
believe
he
is
available.
as
to
the
availability
of
the
other
witnesses,
i
simply
can’t
answer
for
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
