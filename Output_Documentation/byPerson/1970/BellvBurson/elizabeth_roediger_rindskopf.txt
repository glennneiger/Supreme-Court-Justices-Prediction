ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
arises
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
georgia.
basically,
we're
taking
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
motor
vehicle
safety
responsibility
act
which
appears
as
sections
92
(a)
-
601
through
615
of
the
georgia
code
annotated.
i'll
begin
with
the
description
of
the
facts
in
this
case
which
i
think
will
serve
the
dual
purpose
of
making
clear
the
operation
of
the
act.
basically,
our
contention
is
that
the
act
violates
due
process
of
law
by
operating
to
suspend
the
license
plates
and
vehicle
certificates,
as
well
as
driver's
licenses
of
certain
uninsured
motorists
involved
in
certain
accidents
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows,
petitioner
bell
was
driving
his
own
automobile
in
the
small
town
of
sparks
georgia
november
24.
1968,
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
driving
10
miles
under
the
speed
limit,
he
was
unable
to
avoid
hitting
a
bicycle
ridden
by
a
five
year
old
cyclist
who
had
neglected
to
yield
to
a
stop
sign
and
entered
the
path
of
his
incoming
vehicle.
the
child
suffered
a
broken
leg
as
well
as
a
broken
hip
and
other
injuries
and
the
accident
was
duly
investigated
by
the
chief
of
police
of
sparks
georgia,
who
noted
that
the
child
had
failed
to
yield
to
the
stop
sign
and
found
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
no
traffic
violations
and
consequently
gave
him
no
citation.
subsequent
to
the
accident,
the
parents
of
the
child
filed
an
affidavit
with
the
respondent,
department
of
public
safety,
alleging
that
the
child
had
sustained
damages
in
excess
of
$10,000.00
and
that
these
damages
had
been
caused
by
petitioner
bell.
now,
let
me
digress
here
to
point
out
that
it
was
the
affidavit
filed
by
the
parents
that
triggered
the
operation
of
the
act
and
once
triggered,
the
act
operates
automatically.
so
that
petitioner
thereupon
was
sent
a
notice
of
order
of
suspension
which
required
him
to
do
one
of
three
things
or
to
face
the
suspension
of
his
driver's
license
as
well
as
the
certificates
of
registration
for
his
automobile.
the
three
things
were,
a,
he
must
demonstrate
that
he
had
proof
of
liability
insurance
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
b,
that
he
had
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
whereby
he'd
either
already
paid
the
damages
claimed
or
he
was
doing
so
on
installment
basis,
or
c,
he
had
to
post
bond
in
the
total
amount
of
the
damages
claimed
as
well
as
obtain
liability
insurance
for
one
year
in
the
future.
now,
these
three
things
are
mutually
exclusive,
and
he
need
not
do
all
but
he
must
do
one
of
the
three
things
to
avoid
the
suspension.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
it
would
be
improper
and
mrs.
beasley
shakes
her
head
if
i
said
they
conceded
it
as
will
appear
in
the
description
of
the
facts.
the
petitioner
attempted
to
question
his
liability
in
the
administrative
proceeding,
this
was
denied
him.
he
then
appealed
to
the
superior
court
of
cook
county
and
this
appeal
is
part
of
the
procedure
of
the
act.
at
that
hearing,
the
judge
specifically
found
that
petitioner
was
without
fault.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no
it's
not.
the
act
is
very
specific
in
stating
that
any
findings
in
the
administrative
procedure,
anything
coming
under
the
operation
of
the
act
not
to
be
used
in
ancillary
damaged
action.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
it's
an
appeal
that
they
know
will
appeal
from
the
administrative
procedure.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
the
parents
of
this
child
would
have
had
the
right
to
go
into
court
on
a
separate
action,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
would
have
had
to
go
into
court
if
they
hope
to
make
this
suspension
continous.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct,
there
are
not
parties.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
that
would
be
proper
to
say
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
its
significance
i
think
fits
into
the
overall
scheme.
our
argument
is
that
suspension
is
improper
unless
some
sort
of
possible
negligence
can
be
shown.
in
another
words,
you
cannot
simply
suspend
the
license
of
the
driver
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
very
good
question.
as
the
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
as
the
state
would
have
us
determine
the
act,
there's
no
reason
to
appeal
because
there's
nothing
to
discuss
at
the
appeal.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
held
in
fact,
yes
there's
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
there's
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
the
things
that
actually
can
be
considered
first
at
the
administrative
hearing
and
then
secondly
at
the
court
of
appeal
from
the
administrative
hearing
are
very
much
circumscribed.
you
can
consider
whether
in
fact
there
was
an
accident,
whether
there
was
insurance,
whether
the
person
fell
under
a
few
limited
exceptions,
one
of
which
would
be
the
car
was
parked
at
the
time
of
the
accident
or
the
car
was
used
without
his
permission.
but
you
concede
that
the
subject
matter
in
both
the
administrative
hearing
and
the
court
of
appeal
from
that
are
very
limited.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
right.
and
of
course
our
contention
there
is
that
naturally
it
would
be
possible
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
bring
his
own
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
against
the
child
and
her
parents,
but
by
the
time
he
reached
a
decision
in
that
case,
the
suspension
would
have
run
its
course
anyway.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
and
certainly,
we
are
not
questioning
that
here,
and
of
course
your
question
then
is
why
if
they
can
do
that.
can
they
not
implement
the
system
that
we
have
here?
my
answer
is
simply
that
with
compulsory
liability
insurance
such
as
was
upheld
by
this
court,
ex
parte
poresky,
the
burden
falls
equally
on
all
people.
one
simply
doesn't
discuss
who
is
going
to
be
responsible
for
an
accident.
everyone
must
have
insurance,
that's
not
the
case
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
let's
rephrase
it
slightly
i
would
say
that
if
one
is
going
to
be
insured,
then
the
burden
must
be
equally
distributed
on
all
persons
and
one
does
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
as
to
who
will
have
insurance
and
who
not.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well
now,
the
case
(inaudible)
and
i
didn't
represent
even
the
lower
court
but
i'm
told
by
his
attorney
that
as
a
methodist
minister,
this
was
not
provided
in
his
salary
and
he
did
not
obtain
the
insurance,
he's
not
required
to
have
it.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
he's
a
person
of
very
low
salary
and
the
lawyer
who
represented
him
at
the
lower
level
said
he
simply
did
not
have
or
did
not
allocate
funds
for
insurance.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry?
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
oh
i
suppose
not,
but
i
gather
that
it
was
a
financial
reason,
he
did
not
decide
to
place
money
on
insurance
and
he
was
not
required
to
do
so
by
the
state,
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
a
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
yes
that's
true.
however,
the
question
is
where
does
he
get
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
was
at
fault
and
of
course
that
would
not
occur
in
the
administrative
procedure
under
this
act.
it
would
only
be
in
a
separate
damage
action.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
right.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
for
example,
a
person
who
is
in
an
accident
and
who
has
the
notice
of
suspension
sent
to
him
can
avoid
getting
insurance
by
settling
and
this
is
frequently
what
is
done
because
of
course
that's
the
less
expensive
route
for
a
person
who
needs
his
automobile
perhaps
for
work,
or
what
have
you,
he
simply
enters
into
a
settlement
agreement
even
though
he
may
not
believe
himself
responsible
because
he
can't
afford
the
expense
of
the
bond
on
one
hand
and
the
expense
of
the
insurance
on
the
other.
so
really,
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
persons
who
admit
that
the
are
liable
are
allowed
to
go
without
insurance
and
one
would
assume
that
they
would
be
the
ones
you
want
to
in
system
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
that's
a
complicated
question
but
i
think
the
answer
is
yes
without
going
into
it.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
by
the
time
there
was
judgment
probably
your
license
has
been
suspended
and
reinstated
and
then
of
course
you
would
have
to
pay
the
judgment
or
face
suspension
yet
a
second
time.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no
i
don't,
i
think
that
the
state
and
let
me
add
that
the
state
keeps
no
legislative
history
but
i
have
done
some
looking
into
some
of
the
journals.
it
seems
that
they
are
very
anxious
not
to
employ
a
system
of
compulsory
liability
insurance.
i
think
what
they
could
do
and
what
they
probably
would
do
would
be
to
allow
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
possible
or
probable
liability
as
is
done
in
approximately
four
other
states
in
the
country
at
this
time
and
this
would
be
--
this
liability
could
be
considered
both
at
the
administrative
hearing
as
well
as
at
the
subsequent
court
hearing.
i
think
that's
probably
what
they
would
do,
of
course
i
can't
speak
with
any
authority
on
that.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes
it
would.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
if
they
would
simply
allow
at
the
administrative
procedure
a
consideration
of
whether
or
not
the
person
was
liable
for
the
damages.
whether
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
could
at
a
later
date
be
responsible
for
those
damages
and
i
would
add
that
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
highly
proper
at
such
a
hearing
for
them
to
consider
as
they
do
not
do
now,
the
accident
report
which
is
submitted
after
every
accident
by
the
police
officer
who
investigates
the
accident.
as
things
stand
now,
there
is
absolutely
no
investigation
made,
the
state
simply
proceeds
to
suspend
licenses
on
the
say
so
of
another
person
who
has
been
damaged.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
don't
think
that
he
needs
to
make
a
defense
because
the
state
does
not
require
him
to
have
insurance.
in
other
words,
he
was
given
a
license
without
being
told
that
must
have
it,
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
georgia.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
there
is
a
provision
in
the
act
that
states
that
there
is
a
penalty
for
perjury
but
frankly
i'm
not
able
to
answer
your
question
because
i
do
not
know
of
a
case
where
perjury
has
been
made
use
of.
in
other
words,
the
affidavit
which
is
submitted
simply
is
the
opinion
of
the
person
and
i
gather
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
his
opinion
as
whether
or
not
he's
responsible
and
this
might
not
be
grounds
for
perjury
even
though
in
a
subsequent
damage
action,
he
was
found
to
be
what
responsible
for
the
accident.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
now
that's
a
very
limited
exception
and
it
brings
up
a
good
point.
the
exception
is
that
the
car
was
being
used
without
his
permission.
in
georgia,
there
is
little
--
well,
there
are
three
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
there
is
no
vicarious
liability
for
an
owner
who
lends
his
automobile.
so
that
in
many
situations,
you
have
an
owner
who
lends
his
automobile,
who
could
not
be
held
responsible
in
an
action
at
law
and
yet
who
under
this
act
could
have
his
drivers
license
as
well
as
the
documents
needed
to
operate
his
vehicle
suspended.
i
think
that
the
argument
we're
making
here
is
probably
clear.
we're
arguing
basic
due
process
contentions
that
it's
improper
to
suspend
the
license
that
involves
such
important
rights
as
the
property
in
this
case
of
the
automobile
as
well
as
liberty
and
interstate
trial
without
affording
some
sort
of
prior
due
process
hearing.
we
would
add
that
naturally,
a
balance
has
to
be
struck
between
the
individual
rights
that
we're
asserting
and
the
state
rights
of
the
state
as
asserting.
on
that
point,
we
would
add
that
we
don't
think
that
the
state
has
demonstrated
how
the
act
as
described
here
promotes
public
safety.
even
if
the
act
which
we
do
not
concede
did
promote
public
safety,
we
fail
to
see
why
it's
impossible
to
implement
some
sort
of
a
due
process
hearing
before
suspension
occurs.
the
state
has
nowhere
in
its
brief
explained
why
this
would
be
such
a
hardship
on
it.
experience
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry?
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
we're
saying
that
the
hearing
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
right.
we're
saying
the
as
it
is
now
construed
is
a
nullity,
it
really
accomplishes
no
end
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
that
would
be
possible
but
that's
again
not
what
we
have
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
i
wouldn't
agree
with
your
point
until
we
waive
the
bond
provisions.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
concerned
about
here
is
the
fact
that
this
individual
will
be
required
to
post
over
thousand
dollars
in
bond
as
well
as
obtain
insurance
in
order
to
retain
the
use
of
his
license.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
there
has
been
no
equal
protection
argument
raised
in
this
case,
i
think
it
would
be
possible
to
raise
one,
we
have
not
done
so.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
i
think
that
our
equal
protection
argument
would
be
simply
that
it's
improper
to
require
a
more
of
one
person
than
another
without
showing
some
reasonable
basis
for
doing
so
and
here,
this
individual
who
has
not
been
shown
financially
irresponsible
nor
negligent
is
being
required
to
post
a
fairly
substantial
bond
over
a
thousand
dollars
as
well
as
obtain
insurance
for
one
year
while
other
individuals
who
may
or
may
not
be
reckless
and
financially
irresponsible
are
not
being
required
to
do
that.
now,
we
don't
raise
this
point
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
suppose
bell
were
injured,
our
petitioner
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
oh
i'm
sorry.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
again
i
would
say
that
equal
protection
does
not
allow
the
access
to
a
court
to
be
conditioned
on
posting
so
large
a
bond.
that's
i
think
partially
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
if
he
feels
he
is
not
responsible
for
the
accident
and
wants
to
have
the
case
tried
in
court
where
he
will
either
be
found
negligent
or
not
negligent,
he
has
to
put
up
a
substantial
amount
of
money
in
order
to
ever
even
defend
against
such
a
court
action
and
let
me
point
out
again
that
the
driver
who
decides
that
its
either
too
much
money
to
post
the
bond
or
feels
perhaps
he's
responsible
and
enters
into
a
settlement
agreement
is
through
with
the
act
at
that
point.
he
never
has
to
obtain
insurance,
yet
all
persons
who
contends
that
he
is
not
responsible
for
the
damages
in
this
accident
and
any
i
think
--
any
investigation
of
even
the
most
basic
documents
on
file
would
show
that
he
probably
is
not
responsible,
is
being
required
both
to
get
insurance
as
well
as
to
post
a
large
bond.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
on
that
because
there
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
one
accident
wouldn't
concern
me
if
the
person
could
be
shown
in
which
as
long
as
there's
a
basis
for
requiring
this
person
to
get
insurance.
of
course,
if
you
want
to
require
everyone
to
have
insurance
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
if
you
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
would
be
slightly
concerned
with
that,
i
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
of
course
that's
not
an
issue
here,
i'm
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
that
if
you
were
found
responsible
for
the
accident
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
as
long
as
that
is
required
of
everyone,
i
think,
let
me
remand
my
answer,
i
would
say
it
would
be
alright.
of
course
in
georgia,
you
understand,
two
drivers
can
be
involved
in
an
accident
and
only
one
of
them
is
required
to
post
or
to
obtain
insurance.
in
other
words
the
person
who
settles
is
not
required
to
obtain
insurance.
i
wouldn't
object
to
the
hypothetical
you're
posing
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
long
as
every
driver
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
i'm
saying
one
is
required
to
pay
and
one
is
not
required
to
pay.
in
other
words,
the
driver
who
settles
is
not
required
then
to
also
have
insurance.
he
may
have
settled
because
he
felt
he
was
responsible
in
the
accident.
in
answer
to
your
hypothetical,
i'm
saying
that
as
long
as
every
driver
after
involvement
in
an
accident
is
required
to
have
insurance,
i
would
not
object
to
that
but
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
not
this
case,
no.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
in
this
case,
given
in
an
accident
and
two
parties
involvement,
one
person
maybe
required
to
get
insurance
simply
because
he
feels
he
wants
to
take
his
case
to
court,
he
wants
the
court
adjudication
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
responsible.
in
that
case
he
must
respond
and
also
get
insurance.
another
person
maybe
totally
responsible
for
the
accident
and
because
he
agrees
to
settle
before
suspension.
in
other
words,
does
not
insist
on
a
court
adjudication,
he
is
a
lot
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
the
due
process
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
and
that's
the
argument
we're
raising.
as
i
said,
we
are
not
raising
an
equal
protection
argument
and
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
and
this
was
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
black
i
believe.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
i
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
under
the
terms
of
the
act,
it
would
be
improper
to
have
a
final
adjudication
as
to
liability,
that's
not
what
we're
asking.
we're
seeking
assistance
such
as
what
is
presently
operative
in
arizona
where
there
is
an
administrative
hearing
where
they
consider
the
possibility
of
a
judgment
and
i
should
add
that
at
one
time
the
georgia
act
had
such
a
provision
and
it
read
that
anyone
who
is
obviously
free
from
fault
will
be
allowed
to
--
in
other
words,
will
escape
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
will
not
be
required
to
comply
with
it
and
that's
really
what
we're
seeking
again.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
believe
it
would
and
again,
this
would
not
be
a
finding
that
would
be
used
in
a
damage
action
against
him.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
every
state
has
some
form
either
of
compulsory
insurance
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
i
would
say
that
there
are
roughly
half
of
the
states
that
operate
this
act
exactly
as
georgia
does.
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
understood
to
say
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
yes,
this
is
model
act
with
minor
embellishments.
other
states
have
an
almost
an
identical
act
but
there
are
perhaps
well,
one
example
would
be
many
states
allow
the
administrative
officer
discretion
as
to
what
the
bond
will
be,
georgia
does
not
allow
that.
the
act
reads
that
the
bond
cannot
be
lower
than
the
amounts
sworn
to
on
the
affidavit
and
states
that
have
such
an
act
i
would
say
are
perhaps
25.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
the
basis
is
simply
that
insurance
companies
have
lobbied
very
powerfully
against
compulsory
insurance
which
they
feel
would
be
very
costly
to
them,
they
would
be
required
to
absorb
risks
of
all
people
rather
than
just
those
that
they
chose
and
i
think
that
the
congressional
hearings
have
pointed
this
out,
that
it's
the
insurance
companies
who'd
lobbied
against
it.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry.
should
i
repeat
that?
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
the
question
was,
why
have
states
not
employed
compulsory
liability
insurance
and
my
answer
was
and
i
base
this
answer
on
some
reading
i've
done
in
the
georgia
legislative
journals
that
the
insurance
lobby
has
powerfully
pressured
the
states
not
to
have
compulsory
liability
insurance.
they
feel
that
it
would
expensive
for
them
to
have
to
insure
the
entire
driving
public.
they
would
much
rather
have
this
kind
of
a
system
and
of
course
the
motor
vehicle
safety
responsibility
act
that's
under
attack
here
fits
hand
and
glove
with
the
uninsured
motorist
provisions.
in
georgia,
every
insurance
policy
must
include
a
provision
which
allows
the
insured
to
have
coverage
should
he
be
in
an
accident
with
an
uninsured
motorist.
the
insurance
company
then
goes
against
that
uninsured
motorist
on
a
system
of
subrogation,
its
not
called
subrogation
but
it
is
the
same
thing
and
that
points
up
again
that
this
act
is
generally
brought
into
play
by
insurance
companies
who
have
already
paid
off
the
other
driver
and
are
now
seeking
to
either
sue
or
to
pressure
into
settlement
the
uninsured
motorist.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
yes
it
does.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
believe
michigan
is
such
as
state
but
i'm
not
able
to
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
yes
it
is.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
thank
you.
i'll
try
and
be
brief,
i
have
only
a
few
points
i'd
like
to
make.
my
first
point
goes
to
what
mr.
justice
marshall
just
asked
mrs.
beasley.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
when
these
documents
that
are
required
for
the
operation
of
a
vehicle
in
georgia
are
suspended,
the
person
not
only
loses
the
ability
to
drive
his
car,
he
can't
sell
his
car,
he
can
do
nothing
with
it.
i
suppose
he
could
sell
it
for
junk
but
he
cannot
sell
it
because
he
doesn't
have
registration
papers
for
it.
the
state
has
taken
those.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
go
perhaps
a
little
more
deeply
into
the
individual
facts
in
this
case.
the
accident
as
you
remember
occurred
on
the
24th
of
november
1968,
the
affidavit
which
triggered
the
operation
of
this
act
was
filed
i
believe
february
28,
i
may
not
be
exactly
right
on
the
date,
it
was
in
february.
so
there
was
quite
a
lapse
of
time
there
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
it
was
an
attorney
who
sent
the
first
letter
asking
how
to
start
the
act
operating
for
the
parents.
now,
from
that
time
to
this,
there
has
been
no
suit
filed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
father's
right
to
sue
has
now
lapsed.
the
statute
of
limitations
in
georgia
is
two
years
and
it
is
run.
the
child
may
still
have
an
opportunity
to
sue
after
his
disability,
his
minority
is
removed.
but
i
think
this
shows
clearly
the
point
that
what's
happening
here
is
this
is
being
used
as
pressure
tactic
to
attempt
to
get
a
settlement
where
you
might
not
stand
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
getting
a
judgment
if
you
were
forced
to
go
to
court.
my
third
point
concerns
the
discussion
we
had
on
the
administrative
procedure
here.
we
are
not
asking
that
before
this
act
is
ever
called
into
operation,
a
hearing
must
be
held.
we
are
simply
saying
that
in
a
case
where
an
individual
believes
himself
to
be
not
liable,
he
got
a
chance
to
have
a
hearing,
to
request
it.
and
i
will
simply
refer
the
court
to
the
letter
from
the
arizona,
department
of
public
safety,
i
think
the
statements
--
this
appears
at
the
end
of
my
brief,
the
petitioner's
brief.
i
think
the
statements
in
there
are
helpful
as
to
the
operation
of
that
act,
they
haven't
found
it
a
hardship.
and
they've
also
found
that
of
the
administrative
hearings
they've
held,
some
700
per
year,
there
have
been
a
total
in
a
three
year
span
of
eight
appeals.
i
think
that
shows
the
success
of
the
operation
of
the
act
as
we
see,
it
should
properly
be
interpreted.
i
have
nothing
further,
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
arises
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
georgia.
basically,
we're
taking
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
motor
vehicle
safety
responsibility
act
which
appears
as
sections
92
(a)
-
601
through
615
of
the
georgia
code
annotated.
i'll
begin
with
the
description
of
the
facts
in
this
case
which
i
think
will
serve
the
dual
purpose
of
making
clear
the
operation
of
the
act.
basically,
our
contention
is
that
the
act
violates
due
process
of
law
by
operating
to
suspend
the
license
plates
and
vehicle
certificates,
as
well
as
driver's
licenses
of
certain
uninsured
motorists
involved
in
certain
accidents
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows,
petitioner
bell
was
driving
his
own
automobile
in
the
small
town
of
sparks
georgia
november
24.
1968,
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
driving
10
miles
under
the
speed
limit,
he
was
unable
to
avoid
hitting
a
bicycle
ridden
by
a
five
year
old
cyclist
who
had
neglected
to
yield
to
a
stop
sign
and
entered
the
path
of
his
incoming
vehicle.
the
child
suffered
a
broken
leg
as
well
as
a
broken
hip
and
other
injuries
and
the
accident
was
duly
investigated
by
the
chief
of
police
of
sparks
georgia,
who
noted
that
the
child
had
failed
to
yield
to
the
stop
sign
and
found
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
no
traffic
violations
and
consequently
gave
him
no
citation.
subsequent
to
the
accident,
the
parents
of
the
child
filed
an
affidavit
with
the
respondent,
department
of
public
safety,
alleging
that
the
child
had
sustained
damages
in
excess
of
$10,000.00
and
that
these
damages
had
been
caused
by
petitioner
bell.
now,
let
me
digress
here
to
point
out
that
it
was
the
affidavit
filed
by
the
parents
that
triggered
the
operation
of
the
act
and
once
triggered,
the
act
operates
automatically.
so
that
petitioner
thereupon
was
sent
a
notice
of
order
of
suspension
which
required
him
to
do
one
of
three
things
or
to
face
the
suspension
of
his
driver's
license
as
well
as
the
certificates
of
registration
for
his
automobile.
the
three
things
were,
a,
he
must
demonstrate
that
he
had
proof
of
liability
insurance
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
b,
that
he
had
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
whereby
he'd
either
already
paid
the
damages
claimed
or
he
was
doing
so
on
installment
basis,
or
c,
he
had
to
post
bond
in
the
total
amount
of
the
damages
claimed
as
well
as
obtain
liability
insurance
for
one
year
in
the
future.
now,
these
three
things
are
mutually
exclusive,
and
he
need
not
do
all
but
he
must
do
one
of
the
three
things
to
avoid
the
suspension.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
it
would
be
improper
and
mrs.
beasley
shakes
her
head
if
i
said
they
conceded
it
as
will
appear
in
the
description
of
the
facts.
the
petitioner
attempted
to
question
his
liability
in
the
administrative
proceeding,
this
was
denied
him.
he
then
appealed
to
the
superior
court
of
cook
county
and
this
appeal
is
part
of
the
procedure
of
the
act.
at
that
hearing,
the
judge
specifically
found
that
petitioner
was
without
fault.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no
it's
not.
the
act
is
very
specific
in
stating
that
any
findings
in
the
administrative
procedure,
anything
coming
under
the
operation
of
the
act
not
to
be
used
in
ancillary
damaged
action.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
it's
an
appeal
that
they
know
will
appeal
from
the
administrative
procedure.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
the
parents
of
this
child
would
have
had
the
right
to
go
into
court
on
a
separate
action,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
would
have
had
to
go
into
court
if
they
hope
to
make
this
suspension
continous.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct,
there
are
not
parties.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
that
would
be
proper
to
say
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
its
significance
i
think
fits
into
the
overall
scheme.
our
argument
is
that
suspension
is
improper
unless
some
sort
of
possible
negligence
can
be
shown.
in
another
words,
you
cannot
simply
suspend
the
license
of
the
driver
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
very
good
question.
as
the
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
as
the
state
would
have
us
determine
the
act,
there's
no
reason
to
appeal
because
there's
nothing
to
discuss
at
the
appeal.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
held
in
fact,
yes
there's
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
there's
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
the
things
that
actually
can
be
considered
first
at
the
administrative
hearing
and
then
secondly
at
the
court
of
appeal
from
the
administrative
hearing
are
very
much
circumscribed.
you
can
consider
whether
in
fact
there
was
an
accident,
whether
there
was
insurance,
whether
the
person
fell
under
a
few
limited
exceptions,
one
of
which
would
be
the
car
was
parked
at
the
time
of
the
accident
or
the
car
was
used
without
his
permission.
but
you
concede
that
the
subject
matter
in
both
the
administrative
hearing
and
the
court
of
appeal
from
that
are
very
limited.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
right.
and
of
course
our
contention
there
is
that
naturally
it
would
be
possible
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
bring
his
own
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
against
the
child
and
her
parents,
but
by
the
time
he
reached
a
decision
in
that
case,
the
suspension
would
have
run
its
course
anyway.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
and
certainly,
we
are
not
questioning
that
here,
and
of
course
your
question
then
is
why
if
they
can
do
that.
can
they
not
implement
the
system
that
we
have
here?
my
answer
is
simply
that
with
compulsory
liability
insurance
such
as
was
upheld
by
this
court,
ex
parte
poresky,
the
burden
falls
equally
on
all
people.
one
simply
doesn't
discuss
who
is
going
to
be
responsible
for
an
accident.
everyone
must
have
insurance,
that's
not
the
case
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
let's
rephrase
it
slightly
i
would
say
that
if
one
is
going
to
be
insured,
then
the
burden
must
be
equally
distributed
on
all
persons
and
one
does
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
as
to
who
will
have
insurance
and
who
not.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well
now,
the
case
(inaudible)
and
i
didn't
represent
even
the
lower
court
but
i'm
told
by
his
attorney
that
as
a
methodist
minister,
this
was
not
provided
in
his
salary
and
he
did
not
obtain
the
insurance,
he's
not
required
to
have
it.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
he's
a
person
of
very
low
salary
and
the
lawyer
who
represented
him
at
the
lower
level
said
he
simply
did
not
have
or
did
not
allocate
funds
for
insurance.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry?
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
oh
i
suppose
not,
but
i
gather
that
it
was
a
financial
reason,
he
did
not
decide
to
place
money
on
insurance
and
he
was
not
required
to
do
so
by
the
state,
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
a
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
yes
that's
true.
however,
the
question
is
where
does
he
get
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
was
at
fault
and
of
course
that
would
not
occur
in
the
administrative
procedure
under
this
act.
it
would
only
be
in
a
separate
damage
action.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
right.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
for
example,
a
person
who
is
in
an
accident
and
who
has
the
notice
of
suspension
sent
to
him
can
avoid
getting
insurance
by
settling
and
this
is
frequently
what
is
done
because
of
course
that's
the
less
expensive
route
for
a
person
who
needs
his
automobile
perhaps
for
work,
or
what
have
you,
he
simply
enters
into
a
settlement
agreement
even
though
he
may
not
believe
himself
responsible
because
he
can't
afford
the
expense
of
the
bond
on
one
hand
and
the
expense
of
the
insurance
on
the
other.
so
really,
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
persons
who
admit
that
the
are
liable
are
allowed
to
go
without
insurance
and
one
would
assume
that
they
would
be
the
ones
you
want
to
in
system
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
that's
a
complicated
question
but
i
think
the
answer
is
yes
without
going
into
it.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
by
the
time
there
was
judgment
probably
your
license
has
been
suspended
and
reinstated
and
then
of
course
you
would
have
to
pay
the
judgment
or
face
suspension
yet
a
second
time.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no
i
don't,
i
think
that
the
state
and
let
me
add
that
the
state
keeps
no
legislative
history
but
i
have
done
some
looking
into
some
of
the
journals.
it
seems
that
they
are
very
anxious
not
to
employ
a
system
of
compulsory
liability
insurance.
i
think
what
they
could
do
and
what
they
probably
would
do
would
be
to
allow
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
possible
or
probable
liability
as
is
done
in
approximately
four
other
states
in
the
country
at
this
time
and
this
would
be
--
this
liability
could
be
considered
both
at
the
administrative
hearing
as
well
as
at
the
subsequent
court
hearing.
i
think
that's
probably
what
they
would
do,
of
course
i
can't
speak
with
any
authority
on
that.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes
it
would.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
if
they
would
simply
allow
at
the
administrative
procedure
a
consideration
of
whether
or
not
the
person
was
liable
for
the
damages.
whether
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
could
at
a
later
date
be
responsible
for
those
damages
and
i
would
add
that
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
highly
proper
at
such
a
hearing
for
them
to
consider
as
they
do
not
do
now,
the
accident
report
which
is
submitted
after
every
accident
by
the
police
officer
who
investigates
the
accident.
as
things
stand
now,
there
is
absolutely
no
investigation
made,
the
state
simply
proceeds
to
suspend
licenses
on
the
say
so
of
another
person
who
has
been
damaged.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
don't
think
that
he
needs
to
make
a
defense
because
the
state
does
not
require
him
to
have
insurance.
in
other
words,
he
was
given
a
license
without
being
told
that
must
have
it,
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
georgia.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
there
is
a
provision
in
the
act
that
states
that
there
is
a
penalty
for
perjury
but
frankly
i'm
not
able
to
answer
your
question
because
i
do
not
know
of
a
case
where
perjury
has
been
made
use
of.
in
other
words,
the
affidavit
which
is
submitted
simply
is
the
opinion
of
the
person
and
i
gather
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
his
opinion
as
whether
or
not
he's
responsible
and
this
might
not
be
grounds
for
perjury
even
though
in
a
subsequent
damage
action,
he
was
found
to
be
what
responsible
for
the
accident.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
now
that's
a
very
limited
exception
and
it
brings
up
a
good
point.
the
exception
is
that
the
car
was
being
used
without
his
permission.
in
georgia,
there
is
little
--
well,
there
are
three
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
there
is
no
vicarious
liability
for
an
owner
who
lends
his
automobile.
so
that
in
many
situations,
you
have
an
owner
who
lends
his
automobile,
who
could
not
be
held
responsible
in
an
action
at
law
and
yet
who
under
this
act
could
have
his
drivers
license
as
well
as
the
documents
needed
to
operate
his
vehicle
suspended.
i
think
that
the
argument
we're
making
here
is
probably
clear.
we're
arguing
basic
due
process
contentions
that
it's
improper
to
suspend
the
license
that
involves
such
important
rights
as
the
property
in
this
case
of
the
automobile
as
well
as
liberty
and
interstate
trial
without
affording
some
sort
of
prior
due
process
hearing.
we
would
add
that
naturally,
a
balance
has
to
be
struck
between
the
individual
rights
that
we're
asserting
and
the
state
rights
of
the
state
as
asserting.
on
that
point,
we
would
add
that
we
don't
think
that
the
state
has
demonstrated
how
the
act
as
described
here
promotes
public
safety.
even
if
the
act
which
we
do
not
concede
did
promote
public
safety,
we
fail
to
see
why
it's
impossible
to
implement
some
sort
of
a
due
process
hearing
before
suspension
occurs.
the
state
has
nowhere
in
its
brief
explained
why
this
would
be
such
a
hardship
on
it.
experience
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry?
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
we're
saying
that
the
hearing
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
right.
we're
saying
the
as
it
is
now
construed
is
a
nullity,
it
really
accomplishes
no
end
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
that
would
be
possible
but
that's
again
not
what
we
have
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
i
wouldn't
agree
with
your
point
until
we
waive
the
bond
provisions.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
concerned
about
here
is
the
fact
that
this
individual
will
be
required
to
post
over
thousand
dollars
in
bond
as
well
as
obtain
insurance
in
order
to
retain
the
use
of
his
license.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
there
has
been
no
equal
protection
argument
raised
in
this
case,
i
think
it
would
be
possible
to
raise
one,
we
have
not
done
so.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
i
think
that
our
equal
protection
argument
would
be
simply
that
it's
improper
to
require
a
more
of
one
person
than
another
without
showing
some
reasonable
basis
for
doing
so
and
here,
this
individual
who
has
not
been
shown
financially
irresponsible
nor
negligent
is
being
required
to
post
a
fairly
substantial
bond
over
a
thousand
dollars
as
well
as
obtain
insurance
for
one
year
while
other
individuals
who
may
or
may
not
be
reckless
and
financially
irresponsible
are
not
being
required
to
do
that.
now,
we
don't
raise
this
point
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
suppose
bell
were
injured,
our
petitioner
here.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
oh
i'm
sorry.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
again
i
would
say
that
equal
protection
does
not
allow
the
access
to
a
court
to
be
conditioned
on
posting
so
large
a
bond.
that's
i
think
partially
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
if
he
feels
he
is
not
responsible
for
the
accident
and
wants
to
have
the
case
tried
in
court
where
he
will
either
be
found
negligent
or
not
negligent,
he
has
to
put
up
a
substantial
amount
of
money
in
order
to
ever
even
defend
against
such
a
court
action
and
let
me
point
out
again
that
the
driver
who
decides
that
its
either
too
much
money
to
post
the
bond
or
feels
perhaps
he's
responsible
and
enters
into
a
settlement
agreement
is
through
with
the
act
at
that
point.
he
never
has
to
obtain
insurance,
yet
all
persons
who
contends
that
he
is
not
responsible
for
the
damages
in
this
accident
and
any
i
think
--
any
investigation
of
even
the
most
basic
documents
on
file
would
show
that
he
probably
is
not
responsible,
is
being
required
both
to
get
insurance
as
well
as
to
post
a
large
bond.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
on
that
because
there
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
one
accident
wouldn't
concern
me
if
the
person
could
be
shown
in
which
as
long
as
there's
a
basis
for
requiring
this
person
to
get
insurance.
of
course,
if
you
want
to
require
everyone
to
have
insurance
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
if
you
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
would
be
slightly
concerned
with
that,
i
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
of
course
that's
not
an
issue
here,
i'm
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
think
that
if
you
were
found
responsible
for
the
accident
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
as
long
as
that
is
required
of
everyone,
i
think,
let
me
remand
my
answer,
i
would
say
it
would
be
alright.
of
course
in
georgia,
you
understand,
two
drivers
can
be
involved
in
an
accident
and
only
one
of
them
is
required
to
post
or
to
obtain
insurance.
in
other
words
the
person
who
settles
is
not
required
to
obtain
insurance.
i
wouldn't
object
to
the
hypothetical
you're
posing
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
long
as
every
driver
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
i'm
saying
one
is
required
to
pay
and
one
is
not
required
to
pay.
in
other
words,
the
driver
who
settles
is
not
required
then
to
also
have
insurance.
he
may
have
settled
because
he
felt
he
was
responsible
in
the
accident.
in
answer
to
your
hypothetical,
i'm
saying
that
as
long
as
every
driver
after
involvement
in
an
accident
is
required
to
have
insurance,
i
would
not
object
to
that
but
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
not
this
case,
no.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
in
this
case,
given
in
an
accident
and
two
parties
involvement,
one
person
maybe
required
to
get
insurance
simply
because
he
feels
he
wants
to
take
his
case
to
court,
he
wants
the
court
adjudication
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
responsible.
in
that
case
he
must
respond
and
also
get
insurance.
another
person
maybe
totally
responsible
for
the
accident
and
because
he
agrees
to
settle
before
suspension.
in
other
words,
does
not
insist
on
a
court
adjudication,
he
is
a
lot
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
the
due
process
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
and
that's
the
argument
we're
raising.
as
i
said,
we
are
not
raising
an
equal
protection
argument
and
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
and
this
was
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
black
i
believe.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
no,
i
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
under
the
terms
of
the
act,
it
would
be
improper
to
have
a
final
adjudication
as
to
liability,
that's
not
what
we're
asking.
we're
seeking
assistance
such
as
what
is
presently
operative
in
arizona
where
there
is
an
administrative
hearing
where
they
consider
the
possibility
of
a
judgment
and
i
should
add
that
at
one
time
the
georgia
act
had
such
a
provision
and
it
read
that
anyone
who
is
obviously
free
from
fault
will
be
allowed
to
--
in
other
words,
will
escape
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
will
not
be
required
to
comply
with
it
and
that's
really
what
we're
seeking
again.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
believe
it
would
and
again,
this
would
not
be
a
finding
that
would
be
used
in
a
damage
action
against
him.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
every
state
has
some
form
either
of
compulsory
insurance
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
i
would
say
that
there
are
roughly
half
of
the
states
that
operate
this
act
exactly
as
georgia
does.
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
understood
to
say
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
yes,
this
is
model
act
with
minor
embellishments.
other
states
have
an
almost
an
identical
act
but
there
are
perhaps
well,
one
example
would
be
many
states
allow
the
administrative
officer
discretion
as
to
what
the
bond
will
be,
georgia
does
not
allow
that.
the
act
reads
that
the
bond
cannot
be
lower
than
the
amounts
sworn
to
on
the
affidavit
and
states
that
have
such
an
act
i
would
say
are
perhaps
25.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
well,
the
basis
is
simply
that
insurance
companies
have
lobbied
very
powerfully
against
compulsory
insurance
which
they
feel
would
be
very
costly
to
them,
they
would
be
required
to
absorb
risks
of
all
people
rather
than
just
those
that
they
chose
and
i
think
that
the
congressional
hearings
have
pointed
this
out,
that
it's
the
insurance
companies
who'd
lobbied
against
it.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i'm
sorry.
should
i
repeat
that?
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
the
question
was,
why
have
states
not
employed
compulsory
liability
insurance
and
my
answer
was
and
i
base
this
answer
on
some
reading
i've
done
in
the
georgia
legislative
journals
that
the
insurance
lobby
has
powerfully
pressured
the
states
not
to
have
compulsory
liability
insurance.
they
feel
that
it
would
expensive
for
them
to
have
to
insure
the
entire
driving
public.
they
would
much
rather
have
this
kind
of
a
system
and
of
course
the
motor
vehicle
safety
responsibility
act
that's
under
attack
here
fits
hand
and
glove
with
the
uninsured
motorist
provisions.
in
georgia,
every
insurance
policy
must
include
a
provision
which
allows
the
insured
to
have
coverage
should
he
be
in
an
accident
with
an
uninsured
motorist.
the
insurance
company
then
goes
against
that
uninsured
motorist
on
a
system
of
subrogation,
its
not
called
subrogation
but
it
is
the
same
thing
and
that
points
up
again
that
this
act
is
generally
brought
into
play
by
insurance
companies
who
have
already
paid
off
the
other
driver
and
are
now
seeking
to
either
sue
or
to
pressure
into
settlement
the
uninsured
motorist.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
yes
it
does.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
i
believe
michigan
is
such
as
state
but
i'm
not
able
to
--
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
yes,
yes
it
is.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
elizabeth
roediger
rindskopf
thank
you.
i'll
try
and
be
brief,
i
have
only
a
few
points
i'd
like
to
make.
my
first
point
goes
to
what
mr.
justice
marshall
just
asked
mrs.
beasley.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
when
these
documents
that
are
required
for
the
operation
of
a
vehicle
in
georgia
are
suspended,
the
person
not
only
loses
the
ability
to
drive
his
car,
he
can't
sell
his
car,
he
can
do
nothing
with
it.
i
suppose
he
could
sell
it
for
junk
but
he
cannot
sell
it
because
he
doesn't
have
registration
papers
for
it.
the
state
has
taken
those.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
go
perhaps
a
little
more
deeply
into
the
individual
facts
in
this
case.
the
accident
as
you
remember
occurred
on
the
24th
of
november
1968,
the
affidavit
which
triggered
the
operation
of
this
act
was
filed
i
believe
february
28,
i
may
not
be
exactly
right
on
the
date,
it
was
in
february.
so
there
was
quite
a
lapse
of
time
there
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
it
was
an
attorney
who
sent
the
first
letter
asking
how
to
start
the
act
operating
for
the
parents.
now,
from
that
time
to
this,
there
has
been
no
suit
filed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
father's
right
to
sue
has
now
lapsed.
the
statute
of
limitations
in
georgia
is
two
years
and
it
is
run.
the
child
may
still
have
an
opportunity
to
sue
after
his
disability,
his
minority
is
removed.
but
i
think
this
shows
clearly
the
point
that
what's
happening
here
is
this
is
being
used
as
pressure
tactic
to
attempt
to
get
a
settlement
where
you
might
not
stand
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
getting
a
judgment
if
you
were
forced
to
go
to
court.
my
third
point
concerns
the
discussion
we
had
on
the
administrative
procedure
here.
we
are
not
asking
that
before
this
act
is
ever
called
into
operation,
a
hearing
must
be
held.
we
are
simply
saying
that
in
a
case
where
an
individual
believes
himself
to
be
not
liable,
he
got
a
chance
to
have
a
hearing,
to
request
it.
and
i
will
simply
refer
the
court
to
the
letter
from
the
arizona,
department
of
public
safety,
i
think
the
statements
--
this
appears
at
the
end
of
my
brief,
the
petitioner's
brief.
i
think
the
statements
in
there
are
helpful
as
to
the
operation
of
that
act,
they
haven't
found
it
a
hardship.
and
they've
also
found
that
of
the
administrative
hearings
they've
held,
some
700
per
year,
there
have
been
a
total
in
a
three
year
span
of
eight
appeals.
i
think
that
shows
the
success
of
the
operation
of
the
act
as
we
see,
it
should
properly
be
interpreted.
i
have
nothing
further,
thank
you.
