justice
thurgood
marshall
it
did
say
the
defendant,
he
was
driving
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
he
could
defend
at
this
hearing
that
the
car
was
not
being
used
by
him,
it
was
used
without
his
knowledge
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
supposed
he
was
indigent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
was
indigent,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--what
would
you
say
about
equal
protection
argued
on
our
recent
opinions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
big
problem
for
a
judge
who
passed
a
law
that
the
person
says
by
the
accident
without
insurance
will
take
that
insurance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
one
accident
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
main
point
is
that
you
involved
in
one
accident
and
now
are
you
required
to
get
insurance
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
only
because
you
haven't
obtained
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
must
be
concerned
with
any
states
that
have
a
rule,
if
you
have
one
accident
you
get
points,
whether
you
are
at
fault
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
realize
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
can
get
points
to
illusion,
if
you
have
enough
but
your
are
losing
life,
were
you
at
fault
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could,
the
equal
protection
wise.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
one
can
pay
and
one
can't,
that's
equal
protection.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
it
were
a
due
process
argument
on
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
see
the
due
process
on
the
point
that
you
don't
allow
him
to
show
that
he
is
waiving
the
cause?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
say
an
agreement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything,
am
i
correct
that
if
you
had
an
accident
between
two
cars
and
somebody
is
injured
and
the
police
filed
charges
against
one
driver
and
he's
convicted
of
reckless
driving
and
has
insurance
and
the
other
driver
is
found
not
guilty
of
anything
and
doesn't
have
insurance,
he
loses
his
driver's
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
uninsured
driver
have
any
right
of
action
against
the
driver
or
down
the
line?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
perjury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
the
interest
of
georgia
isn't
given
maximum
protection
to
the
man
that
can't
afford
to
take
out
insurance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
your
idea
of
maximum
protection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
obtain
a
drivers
license
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
related
in
this
one
that
there
was
no
fault?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
that
court
said
he
was
without
fault?
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
the
claimants
had
their
day
in
court
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
will
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
now,
what
redress
--
suppose
that
this
was
out
of
the
clear
blue
--
there's
nothing
that
man
can
do
about
the
time
his
license
was
suspended,
nothing,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
get
interest
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
pretty
much
the
same
picture,
isn't
it?
i
mean
the
man
that's
protected
is
really
in
a
bad
shape
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
i
can
understand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
that
prevent
the
insurance
company
to
represent
the
complaint
in
body
and
using
this
as
a
weapon
to
get
the
man
responsible
for
making
a
settlement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
insurance
company
says
that
if
you
don't
settle
this,
you're
going
to
have
to
put
up
a
thousand
dollars,
i'm
only
asking
is
a
750.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
the
state
is
saying
is
that
if
you
don't
settle,
you're
going
to
lose
your
license
or
put
up
a
thousand
dollars
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
states
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
think
insurance
companies
would
use
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
in
georgia,
if
he
put
up
a
security,
where
would
he
get
it
other
than
wages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
the
average
rural
persons
in
georgia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
sharecropping?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
wages.
this
poor
man
has
to
take
it
out
of
his
pocket
if
he's
got
it
and
he
got
to
his
pocket
from
wages.
so
here
you
take
out
a
thousand
dollars
and
in
sniadach
they
take
how
much
was
it?
$50.00
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
did
say
the
defendant,
he
was
driving
the
car?
justice
thurgood

did
you
say
he

that
the

was
