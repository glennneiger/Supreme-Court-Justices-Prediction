ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
appears
that
the
petitioner
here
has
missed
the
point
of
the
statute.
what
georgia's
concern
is,
is
with
the
financial
responsibility
and
the
safety
responsibility
of
those
who
traverse
its
highways.
now,
georgia
could
go
to
a
system
of
compulsory
liability
insurance
and
i
don't
known
what
the
motive
of
the
legislature
is
nor
is
it
our
place
to
question
the
motives
of
the
legislature.
but
what
we
have
done
here
as
said
in
georgia,
if
you
are
going
to
have
insurance,
liability
insurance,
we
know
that
the
persons
who
maybe
injured
will
be
covered,
will
be
compensated
for
the
injury
on
the
highways.
if
you
choose
not
to
have
liability
insurance,
then
we
are
going
to
require
you
to
put
up
security
in
the
amount
claimed
until
the
question
is
settled
in
a
court
of
law.
now,
there
are
exceptions
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
the
amount
that
is
claimed
by
the
injured
party
under
affidavit
with
the
statements
of
the
attending
physician
to
back
up
and
to
substantiate
his
claim.
now,
the
director
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
isn't
quite
so
in
practice
mr.
justice
because
the
director
does
have
a
discretion
to
increase
the
amount
or
decrease
the
amount
and
although
the
statute
says
that
it
is
not
to
be
below
the
amount
that's
claimed,
he
does
in
fact
do
so
if
he
believes
it's
too
much
and
it
did
so
in
this
case.
the
amount
claimed
was
$10,000.00,
the
bond
that
was
required
or
the
security
that
was
required
was
$5,000.00,
so
this
is
a
concrete
example
of
the
practical
aspect
of
it
where
it
is
limited
to
an
amount
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
director
would
be
sufficient
to
cover
the
possible
judgment
that
might
be
obtained.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
there
is,
that's
$10,000.00,
the
security
is
$10,000.00
for
a
single
person's
death
or
$20,000.00
for
one
accident
and
$5,000.00
for
property
damage
which
is
the
same
amount
of
minimum
insurance
that's
required.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
state
feels
mr.
chief
justice
that
since
we
could
we
believe
institute
a
system
of
compulsory
insurance,
we
are
merely
delaying
the
requirement
until
the
occurrence
of
a
particular
incident
which
is
related
to
the
liability
and
that
is
involvement
in
an
accident
in
which
a
claim
is
made.
and
so
we
are
simply
delaying
the
requirement
and
the
person
at
the
outset
of
getting
his
license
and
of
licensing
his
car
knows
that,
it's
contained
in
the
driver's
manual
what
the
requirements
of
the
safety
responsibility
law
are.
so,
if
he
chooses
to
bear
the
risk
of
having
to
put
up
security
at
a
later
time,
then
that's
his
own
choice.
he
can
avoid
that
by
getting
insurance
at
the
beginning
and
that's
what
the
state
is
trying
to
get
people
to
do.
they're
trying
to
encourage
them
to
get
insurance
at
the
beginning
but
they
say
we
won't
require
it
because
we
know
that
there
are
some
people
that
aren't
of
great
means
and
would
rather
not
pay
insurance
premiums
over
the
years
and
take
the
risk
of
being
involved
in
an
accident
and
having
to
post
security.
so
that
in
the
event,
there
is
a
judgment
against
him,
there
will
be
money
there
to
cover
that
judgment.
otherwise,
perhaps
he
will
be
judgment
proof.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
he
doesn't
lose
his
drivers
license
mr.
justice,
he
is
given
the
choice
of
putting
up
security
of
the
amount
that's
claimed
by
the
other
driver.
now,
if
that
insured
driver
who
has
been
found
at
fault,
files
a
claim
in
good
faith
with
an
affidavit
that
he
believes
he
has
reasonable
reason
for
possibility
of
a
judgment,
then
he
will
be
required,
the
uninsured
driver
to
post
some
amount
of
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
he
does
because
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
there's
an
affidavit
involved
here.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
so,
he
could
do
that.
he
could
also
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
to
show
that
he's
not
at
fault
and
of
course
he
could
if
he
obtained
a
release
if
the
man
would
agree
to
that,
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
in
certain
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
some
cases,
there
maybe
no
fault.
we
certainly
would
concede
that.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
particular
no,
no,
because
there
hasn't
been
a
finding.
we
don't
know
what
the
facts
were
in
this
particular
case.
the
hearing
that
was
held
in
the
superior
court,
in
the
lower
trial
court
was
an
appeal
from
the
administrative
decision
of
the
department
of
public
safety.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
that
court
held
that
he
was
not
--
that
he
was
without
fault,
that's
correct,
but
the
claimants
weren't
there
and
had
no
notice
of
it.
so
that
the
basis
upon
which
he
found
there
was
no
fault,
we
don't
even
know.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
they
have
not?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
they
may
not
ever.
they
may
not
bring
suit.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
he
can
post
the
security
until
two
years
elapses
and
that's
the
statute
limitations
for
injury
actions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
he
does
not
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
the
man
that's
protected,
i
don't
think
so
because
by
the
same
token
--
you
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
protect
the
man
without
insurance?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
purpose
is
to
protect
the
persons
who
are
injured
on
the
highway
from
not
being
able
to
be
compensated
for
their
injuries.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
that's
the
basic
proposition
behind
the
statute
as
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
ex
parte
poresky,
where
there
was
an
exhaustive
discussion
of
the
safety
responsibility
laws.
now,
as
far
as
--
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
about
the
facts
of
the
case
in
this
instance,
if
the
man
had
posted
security,
he
would
not
then
be
required
to
also
have
insurance.
he
is
only
required
to
put
up
the
insurance
for
future
financial
responsibility
when
he
doesn't
do
it
within
the
30
day
period
from
which
he
gets
his
notice
of
suspension.
so
that
if
he
--
during
this
period,
he
is
an
uninsured
motorist
and
if
he
comes
to
the
department
of
public
safety
either
with
the
security
or
with
a
release
or
with
a
settlement
or
something
of
that
nature,
security
being
one
of
the
several
kinds,
he
has
the
alternative
of.
he
does
not
have
to
get
future
proof
of
financial
responsibility.
it's
only
when
he
has
shown
that
he
is
not
willing
to
take
his
financial
responsibility
that
he
is
required
to
post
this.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
if
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
he
has
put
up
security
at
the
outset
when
it
is
demanded
of
him,
that
is
within
the
30
days
of
the
demand
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
might
be
said
with
60
days
of
the
accident,
something
like
that.
if
he
has
put
up
that
security,
he
does
not
have
to
buy
the
insurance
later
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
he
can
go
through
again
without
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
he
has,
that's
right.
and
of
course
he's
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--had
his
driver's
license
all
along
if
he's
posed
to
the
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
indeed
a
relevant
factor
and
the
state
of
georgia
feels
that
that
determination
belongs
in
the
courts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
state
is
not
saying
we're
going
to
suspend
your
license.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
put
up
the
security,
put
up
a
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well
then
of
course
his
alternative
should
have
been
to
get
insurance
in
the
first
place
to
cover
it.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
leave
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
person
as
to
whether
he
wants
to
(a)
get
insurance
or
(b)
bear
the
risk
of
coming
under
the
provisions
of
the
safety
responsibility
act.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
are
not
presuming
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
in
those
cases
where
there
isn't
any,
it
would
be
required
for
him
to
put
it
up
until
there's
a
determination
of
fault.
the
department
is
not
in
the
position
to
make
that
determination
because
it's
not
equipped
to
make
judicial
determinations.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
it
wasn't
in
a
negligent
suit,
it
wasn't,
it
was
noticed
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
was
a
determination
that
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
because
it
had
found
that
it
had
no
right
to
make
that
judgment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right
but
as
far
as
the
fault
being
determined
is
concerned,
that
would
not
hold
true
with
respect
but
it's
not
res
judicata
to
the
parties
that
were
involved.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
it
has
never
been
suspended
because
of
the
state,
they
haven't
granted
and
so
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
points
up
a
very
good
thing
about
this
particular
case.
when
mr.
bell
was
brought
under
the
provisions
of
the
safety
responsibility
law,
the
provision
was
that
it
would
be
a
three
year
suspension.
that
has
since
been
changed
by
the
legislature
to
a
one
year
suspension.
there
were
two
cases
that
were
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
the
one
year
suspension
was
retroactive
so
that
in
cases
like
mr.
bell's,
a
person
who
was
going
along
with
the
three
year
suspension
could
all
of
a
sudden
get
his
license
back.
well,
one
of
the
cases
has
been
decided
but
not
on
that
question.
and
as
of
yesterday,
the
second
case
which
has
that
question
in
it
has
not
yet
been
decided.
so
that
we
could
have
a
situation
here
where
mr.
bell
by
virtue
of
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
in
the
dobson
case
could
very
well
get
his
license
or
never
have
a
suspension
because
it
maybe
moot.
the
department
takes
the
position
that
when
they
order
a
suspension
as
of
a
certain
date,
no
matter
what
happens
that
date
and
if
we
go
back
now
and
the
court
here
affirms
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
period
of
time
for
which
the
suspension
would
occur
would
be
until
the
three
years
would
be
up
in
1972.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
so,
and
as
far
as
the
future
proof,
he
does
not
follow
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
he
has
it.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
wouldn't
be
suspended.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it's
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
and
it
was
argued
on
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
for
this
type
of
question,
it
will
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
unless
its
--
certiorari
is
granted
by
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
is
probably
unlikely.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
haven't
any
idea
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
was
argued
on
january
--
i
believe
the
18
and
there
have
been
cases
argued
since
then
on
which
decisions
have
been
rendered,
so
i
don't
know
what
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
relation
short.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
two
fold
mr.
justice
and
the
first
thing
is
that
the
state
believes
that
that
question
is
a
legal
question
which
is
best
reserved
for
the
judicial
processes
of
evidence
gathering,
evidence
presenting
the
legal
questions
involved
in
negligence,
last
clear
chance,
contributory
negligence
and
all
the
things
that
come
into
play.
in
this
particular
case
for
example,
you
have
got
a
child,
what's
the
due
care
--
what's
the
caring
part
of
a
child,
it's
a
legal
question
although
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
only
as
a
sanction
to
try
to
get
him
to
pose
a
security.
the
thing
that
the
state
is
interested
in
is
he's
posing
the
security
and
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
the
state
has
to
have
some
sanction
in
order
to
encourage
him
to
post
it
so
that
in
the
event
there
is
a
judgment,
it
will
not
be
an
empty
one.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
certainly
the
legislature
could
do
that
we
believe.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i'm
sorry,
the
state
hasn't
done
what?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
--
it
says
you
must
pose
security
but
it
doesn't
go
out
and
attach
anything
that's
correct.
the
alternative
is
up
to
the
motorist.
he
may
decide
not
to
post
security
but
then
the
alternative
is
that
he
is
going
to
lose
his
license
for
a
year
or
his
licenses
for
a
year
but
the
reason
that
they
--
the
suspension
provisions
are
in
there
are
to
encourage
people
to
put
up
the
security
and
the
states
interested
in
the
security
being
put
up
for
people
on
the
highways
and
not
really
in
suspending
his
license.
this
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
second
state
interest
is
the
procedural
problems
that
would
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
bring
up
and
to
have
these,
as
i
mentioned
in
the
latter
part
of
our
brief,
last
year,
over
18.000
of
these
--
cases
were
brought
up.
now,
there
wouldn't
be
18,000
hearings
necessarily,
there
would
have
been
although
this
figure
does
not
appear
in
our
brief,
about
13,000
situations
where
the
affidavit
and
the
report
that
is
the
claim
were
filed
and
the
30
days
elapsed
and
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
act
so
that
there
would
have
been
a
suspension
and
it's
those
13,000
that
probably
would
have
been
heard
before
the
suspension
request
would
have
been
made.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
that's
the
trigger.
if
there
is
a
claim
made
along
with
the
accident.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
true
mr.
justice
but
the
act
is
trying
to
reach
the
most
general
situation
and
that
would
be
--
it
would
be
outside
of
the
act
but
it
would
so
rarely
occur
that
--
the
state
is
trying
to
protect
those
people
who
are
on
the
highways
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
also
that
it's
the
state
that
put
those
drivers
on
the
highway.
it's
the
states
highways
and
the
state
is
licensing
them,
so
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
to
be
sure
that
it's
highways
are
kept
free
from
accident.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
because
in
the
first
place,
the
affidavit
must
be
filed
or
the
report
must
be
made
within
10
days
so
--
of
the
accident.
now,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
claim,
you
know
it
or
at
least
you're
going
to
say
that
you
believe
you're
liable
right
away
and
the
party
would
have
to
make
that
determination.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
of
course
if
he
will
settle,
that's
his
choice.
the
state
is
not
compelling
him
to
settle
either
but
if
he
has
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
until
it's
determined
in
court
correct
that
you
are
responsible
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right,
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don't
know
whether
they
do
or
not
but
it's
a
determination
to
be
made
by
the
driver
himself
if
he
is
going
to
bear
the
risk
of
getting
involved
in
an
accident,
then
he
is
going
to
have
to
put
up
the
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well
of
course,
if
they
can't
put
up
a
bond,
then
they
are
probably
going
to
lose
their
license
for
a
period
of
one
year.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
would
have
to
do
that
if
they
were
unwilling
or
unable
to
put
up
the
bond.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
the
situation
is
this,
if
the
man
who
has
the
accident
is
a
poor
man
for
example
and
he
has
a
neighbor
who
has
a
property,
he
could
get
him
perhaps
put
up
a
property
bond
for
him,
he
doesn't
have
to
put
up
cash.
he
can
put
up
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
it's
a
condition
that's
put
on
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
as
far
as
equal
protection
is
concerned,
we're
interested
also
in
protecting
the
poor
person
who's
injured
on
the
highway
and
getting
him
compensated,
perhaps
he
has
no
funds
either
but
we
don't
think
that
this
raises
an
equal
protection
problem
because
the
states
delaying
of
the
requirement
for
security
which
would
be
akin
to
or
equal
to
insurance
if
he
had
insurance
is
to
the
benefit
of
the
poorer
person.
if
we
could
have
compulsory
insurance
that
everybody
had
to
have,
that
would
be
fine.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
and
what
were
saying
is
we're
favoring
those
who
are
poorer
and
who
may
not
have
the
money
to
buy
insurance,
by
delaying
it,
delaying
any
requirement
for
showing
financial
responsibility
until
you're
involved
in
an
accident.
so,
we
don't
think
that
that
favoritism
brings
up
an
equal
protection
problem
except
that
it's
perhaps
discriminatory
against
those
who
buy
insurance,
who
take
their
responsibility
from
the
beginning?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
a
divorce
that
a
case
should
he
on
a
high
level?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
not
necessarily.
i
think
here,
we've
got
persons
who
are
injured
on
the
state's
highways
and
if
the
person
doesn't
have
enough
money
to
post
the
security
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right,
there
certainly
is
but
we
don't
believe
that
there's
an
equal
protection
problem
here
and
of
course
it
is
not
one
at
issue
in
this
case.
it's
a
question
of
whether
there
is
due
process.
as
far
as
the
situation
of
the
other
states
having
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment.
we
believe
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing
for
(inaudible)
to
determine.
moreover,
georgia
is
not
compelled
to
accept
the
procedures
that
other
states
have
just
because
other
states
find
that
they're
good.
as
i
mentioned,
there
would
be
about
13,000
hearings
necessary
in
georgia,
whereas,
arizona
which
apparently
likes
this
system
that
is
suggested
by
the
petitioner
had
only
900.
so
that
the
situation
is
just
entirely
different
but
we
don't
believe
that
constitutional
due
process
would
require
us
to
adopt
arizona's
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
cases
that
are
cited
where
a
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment
are
discussed
are
the
basis
--
the
basis
of
those
cases
is
statutory
construction
and
not
constitutional
requirement,
not
mandate,
although
its
mentioned
in
some
manner.
the
states
are
saying,
well,
our
statute
state
responsibility
requires
there
to
be
a
consideration
of
fault
or
culpability
before
this
suspension.
so
that's
why
we're
requiring
it,
that's
true
in
the
california
cases,
the
arizona
cases
of
schecter
(ph),
it's
true
in
hage
(ph),
the
utah
case
and
its
true
in
arthur
or
in
williams
versus
sills,
the
new
jersey
case
of
last
year
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
new
jersey
case,
chief
justice
winthrop
of
that
state
suggested
in
his
concurring
short
opinion
that
he
saw
no
constitutional
problem
as
far
as
due
process
is
concerned,
that
it
was
and
he
recognized
it
as
being
a
statutory
requirement
there.
so
that
we
believe
there
is
no
due
process
requirement
for
a
consideration
of
fault
at
that
point
but
it
should
be
left
to
courts
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
could
with
a
preliminary
court
hearing
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
believe
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
think
we
have
that
to
a
degree
mr.
chief
justice
in
this
respect.
we
do
have
here
at
least
involvement
in
an
accident,
we're
sure
of
that,
no
insurance,
a
claim
made
with
affidavits
and
with
the
statements
of
the
attending
physicians
and
if
it
is
necessary,
other
evidence
of
damage
and
other
evidences
of
damage
so
that
we
think
we've
got
already
a
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment.
if
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
parties
involved
in
the
accident
and
we
don't
feel
that
the
department
is
in
a
position
to
make
that
judgment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
i
would
like,
thank
you
very
much
for
having
that
opportunity.
sniadach
of
course,
is
the
garnishment
case
and
in
that
case,
there
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
two
cases
mentioned
where
summary
proceedings
were
regarded
to
be
warranted
because
of
what
the
court
called
extraordinary
situations.
one
of
those
was
coffin
brothers
and
that
was
the
situation
in
which
the
bank
holders
or
the
bank
stockholders
were
assessed
after
the
bank
had
been
closed
for
the
purpose
of
paying
off
depositors.
and
the
assessment
was
made
and
execution
was
allowed
thereon
before
there
was
a
determination
in
court.
there
was
allowed
to
be
execution
and
due
process
was
raised
in
that
situation
and
the
court
felt
there
believed
that
that
was
an
extraordinary
situation
and
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
protect
the
depositors
this
way
and
it
was
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process
rather
to
require
the
stockholders
to
put
up
that
money
without
a
question
of
there
being
first
of
all
a
court
hearing.
and
i
think
it
was
very
important
to
this
case
that
in
coffin
brothers
of
course
which
is
cited
in
sniadach,
the
court
found
that
when
they
became
stockholders
they
agreed
to
do
this
and
it's
the
same
thing
when
you
become
a
driver
or
take
out
a
license.
you
agree
to
put
up
the
security
if
you're
involved
in
an
accident.
it's
a
condition
of
your
license,
just
like
obeying
the
other
traffic
laws
would
be
or
having
the
inspections
or
getting
tags.
it's
a
condition
that's
put
on
at
the
outset
and
that
was
one
of
the
differences
that
was
recognized
in
coffin
brothers.
now,
owenbee
(ph)
was
another
one
that
was
mentioned
and
that
involved
a
foreign
attachment
where
in
order
for
you
to
contest
or
to
defend
against
foreign
attachment,
you
had
to
put
up
security
before
any
determination
which
is
the
same
thing
as
we
have
here.
and
the
court
found
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
due
process.
now,
sniadach
with
the
garnishment
situation,
the
court
said
in
these
due
process
cases,
we've
got
to
look
at
two
things,
the
nature
of
the
property
and
the
problems
of
procedural
due
process
that
are
involved.
in
sniadach,
the
nature
of
the
property
was
the
man's
wages
and
the
court
regarded
that
as
a
fundamental
right
that
he
had
to
his
wages
without
the
state
stepping
in
to
help
a
creditor.
first,
we
think,
it's
very
different
when
we're
talking
about
posting
security
and
the
only
right
that
he's
deprived
of
there
is
the
right
to
the
interest
on
that
security
for
two
years,
now,
that's
a
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
property,
it
could
be
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
could
be
his
property,
his
farm
or
someone
else's.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
they
probably
wouldn't
have
property
but
it's
a
condition
we
go
back
again
to
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
was
a
small
amount
i
believe
mr.
justice
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
you
were
taking
his
wages
prior
to
any
hearing,
he
had
no
control
over
it.
in
these
situations
where
you
have
a
driver's
license
which
is
conditioned
on
your
meeting
the
requirements
for
driver's
licenses.
one
of
the
conditions
is
get
insurance
or
be
willing
to
put
up
security
and
that's
not
analogous
to
a
wade
situation
where
a
man
goes
out
and
has
a
right
to
his
wages
without
any
interference
from
the
state
except
for
tax
withholding.
but
here,
the
whole
right
is
conditioned
on
a
privilege
which
is
given
by
the
state
and
which
maybe
conditioned
as
so
long
as
the
general
welfare
is
being
encouraged
thereby.
so
we
think
it's
different
from
sniadach
in
that
view.
also
again,
the
problems
of
procedural
due
process
was
another
view
or
another
matter
that
was
to
be
taken
up
as
the
court
did
in
sniadach
and
we
here
have
discussed
to
some
extent
the
problems
of
procedural
due
process
which
we
see
if
we
have
to
have
court
here
or
administrative
hearings
to
determine
fault.
so
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
appears
that
the
petitioner
here
has
missed
the
point
of
the
statute.
what
georgia's
concern
is,
is
with
the
financial
responsibility
and
the
safety
responsibility
of
those
who
traverse
its
highways.
now,
georgia
could
go
to
a
system
of
compulsory
liability
insurance
and
i
don't
known
what
the
motive
of
the
legislature
is
nor
is
it
our
place
to
question
the
motives
of
the
legislature.
but
what
we
have
done
here
as
said
in
georgia,
if
you
are
going
to
have
insurance,
liability
insurance,
we
know
that
the
persons
who
maybe
injured
will
be
covered,
will
be
compensated
for
the
injury
on
the
highways.
if
you
choose
not
to
have
liability
insurance,
then
we
are
going
to
require
you
to
put
up
security
in
the
amount
claimed
until
the
question
is
settled
in
a
court
of
law.
now,
there
are
exceptions
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
the
amount
that
is
claimed
by
the
injured
party
under
affidavit
with
the
statements
of
the
attending
physician
to
back
up
and
to
substantiate
his
claim.
now,
the
director
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
isn't
quite
so
in
practice
mr.
justice
because
the
director
does
have
a
discretion
to
increase
the
amount
or
decrease
the
amount
and
although
the
statute
says
that
it
is
not
to
be
below
the
amount
that's
claimed,
he
does
in
fact
do
so
if
he
believes
it's
too
much
and
it
did
so
in
this
case.
the
amount
claimed
was
$10,000.00,
the
bond
that
was
required
or
the
security
that
was
required
was
$5,000.00,
so
this
is
a
concrete
example
of
the
practical
aspect
of
it
where
it
is
limited
to
an
amount
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
director
would
be
sufficient
to
cover
the
possible
judgment
that
might
be
obtained.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
there
is,
that's
$10,000.00,
the
security
is
$10,000.00
for
a
single
person's
death
or
$20,000.00
for
one
accident
and
$5,000.00
for
property
damage
which
is
the
same
amount
of
minimum
insurance
that's
required.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that
is
correct
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
state
feels
mr.
chief
justice
that
since
we
could
we
believe
institute
a
system
of
compulsory
insurance,
we
are
merely
delaying
the
requirement
until
the
occurrence
of
a
particular
incident
which
is
related
to
the
liability
and
that
is
involvement
in
an
accident
in
which
a
claim
is
made.
and
so
we
are
simply
delaying
the
requirement
and
the
person
at
the
outset
of
getting
his
license
and
of
licensing
his
car
knows
that,
it's
contained
in
the
driver's
manual
what
the
requirements
of
the
safety
responsibility
law
are.
so,
if
he
chooses
to
bear
the
risk
of
having
to
put
up
security
at
a
later
time,
then
that's
his
own
choice.
he
can
avoid
that
by
getting
insurance
at
the
beginning
and
that's
what
the
state
is
trying
to
get
people
to
do.
they're
trying
to
encourage
them
to
get
insurance
at
the
beginning
but
they
say
we
won't
require
it
because
we
know
that
there
are
some
people
that
aren't
of
great
means
and
would
rather
not
pay
insurance
premiums
over
the
years
and
take
the
risk
of
being
involved
in
an
accident
and
having
to
post
security.
so
that
in
the
event,
there
is
a
judgment
against
him,
there
will
be
money
there
to
cover
that
judgment.
otherwise,
perhaps
he
will
be
judgment
proof.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
he
doesn't
lose
his
drivers
license
mr.
justice,
he
is
given
the
choice
of
putting
up
security
of
the
amount
that's
claimed
by
the
other
driver.
now,
if
that
insured
driver
who
has
been
found
at
fault,
files
a
claim
in
good
faith
with
an
affidavit
that
he
believes
he
has
reasonable
reason
for
possibility
of
a
judgment,
then
he
will
be
required,
the
uninsured
driver
to
post
some
amount
of
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
he
does
because
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
there's
an
affidavit
involved
here.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
so,
he
could
do
that.
he
could
also
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
to
show
that
he's
not
at
fault
and
of
course
he
could
if
he
obtained
a
release
if
the
man
would
agree
to
that,
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
in
certain
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
some
cases,
there
maybe
no
fault.
we
certainly
would
concede
that.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
in
particular
no,
no,
because
there
hasn't
been
a
finding.
we
don't
know
what
the
facts
were
in
this
particular
case.
the
hearing
that
was
held
in
the
superior
court,
in
the
lower
trial
court
was
an
appeal
from
the
administrative
decision
of
the
department
of
public
safety.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
that
court
held
that
he
was
not
--
that
he
was
without
fault,
that's
correct,
but
the
claimants
weren't
there
and
had
no
notice
of
it.
so
that
the
basis
upon
which
he
found
there
was
no
fault,
we
don't
even
know.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
they
have
not?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
they
may
not
ever.
they
may
not
bring
suit.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
he
can
post
the
security
until
two
years
elapses
and
that's
the
statute
limitations
for
injury
actions.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no
he
does
not
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
not
the
man
that's
protected,
i
don't
think
so
because
by
the
same
token
--
you
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
protect
the
man
without
insurance?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
purpose
is
to
protect
the
persons
who
are
injured
on
the
highway
from
not
being
able
to
be
compensated
for
their
injuries.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
and
that's
the
basic
proposition
behind
the
statute
as
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
ex
parte
poresky,
where
there
was
an
exhaustive
discussion
of
the
safety
responsibility
laws.
now,
as
far
as
--
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
about
the
facts
of
the
case
in
this
instance,
if
the
man
had
posted
security,
he
would
not
then
be
required
to
also
have
insurance.
he
is
only
required
to
put
up
the
insurance
for
future
financial
responsibility
when
he
doesn't
do
it
within
the
30
day
period
from
which
he
gets
his
notice
of
suspension.
so
that
if
he
--
during
this
period,
he
is
an
uninsured
motorist
and
if
he
comes
to
the
department
of
public
safety
either
with
the
security
or
with
a
release
or
with
a
settlement
or
something
of
that
nature,
security
being
one
of
the
several
kinds,
he
has
the
alternative
of.
he
does
not
have
to
get
future
proof
of
financial
responsibility.
it's
only
when
he
has
shown
that
he
is
not
willing
to
take
his
financial
responsibility
that
he
is
required
to
post
this.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
if
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
he
has
put
up
security
at
the
outset
when
it
is
demanded
of
him,
that
is
within
the
30
days
of
the
demand
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
might
be
said
with
60
days
of
the
accident,
something
like
that.
if
he
has
put
up
that
security,
he
does
not
have
to
buy
the
insurance
later
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
he
can
go
through
again
without
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
if
he
has,
that's
right.
and
of
course
he's
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--had
his
driver's
license
all
along
if
he's
posed
to
the
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
indeed
a
relevant
factor
and
the
state
of
georgia
feels
that
that
determination
belongs
in
the
courts.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
state
is
not
saying
we're
going
to
suspend
your
license.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
put
up
the
security,
put
up
a
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well
then
of
course
his
alternative
should
have
been
to
get
insurance
in
the
first
place
to
cover
it.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
leave
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
person
as
to
whether
he
wants
to
(a)
get
insurance
or
(b)
bear
the
risk
of
coming
under
the
provisions
of
the
safety
responsibility
act.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
are
not
presuming
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
in
those
cases
where
there
isn't
any,
it
would
be
required
for
him
to
put
it
up
until
there's
a
determination
of
fault.
the
department
is
not
in
the
position
to
make
that
determination
because
it's
not
equipped
to
make
judicial
determinations.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
it
wasn't
in
a
negligent
suit,
it
wasn't,
it
was
noticed
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
was
a
determination
that
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
because
it
had
found
that
it
had
no
right
to
make
that
judgment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right
but
as
far
as
the
fault
being
determined
is
concerned,
that
would
not
hold
true
with
respect
but
it's
not
res
judicata
to
the
parties
that
were
involved.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
it
has
never
been
suspended
because
of
the
state,
they
haven't
granted
and
so
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
points
up
a
very
good
thing
about
this
particular
case.
when
mr.
bell
was
brought
under
the
provisions
of
the
safety
responsibility
law,
the
provision
was
that
it
would
be
a
three
year
suspension.
that
has
since
been
changed
by
the
legislature
to
a
one
year
suspension.
there
were
two
cases
that
were
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
the
one
year
suspension
was
retroactive
so
that
in
cases
like
mr.
bell's,
a
person
who
was
going
along
with
the
three
year
suspension
could
all
of
a
sudden
get
his
license
back.
well,
one
of
the
cases
has
been
decided
but
not
on
that
question.
and
as
of
yesterday,
the
second
case
which
has
that
question
in
it
has
not
yet
been
decided.
so
that
we
could
have
a
situation
here
where
mr.
bell
by
virtue
of
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
in
the
dobson
case
could
very
well
get
his
license
or
never
have
a
suspension
because
it
maybe
moot.
the
department
takes
the
position
that
when
they
order
a
suspension
as
of
a
certain
date,
no
matter
what
happens
that
date
and
if
we
go
back
now
and
the
court
here
affirms
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
period
of
time
for
which
the
suspension
would
occur
would
be
until
the
three
years
would
be
up
in
1972.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
right.
so,
and
as
far
as
the
future
proof,
he
does
not
follow
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
he
has
it.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
wouldn't
be
suspended.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it's
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
and
it
was
argued
on
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
for
this
type
of
question,
it
will
be.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
unless
its
--
certiorari
is
granted
by
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
is
probably
unlikely.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
haven't
any
idea
mr.
justice.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
was
argued
on
january
--
i
believe
the
18
and
there
have
been
cases
argued
since
then
on
which
decisions
have
been
rendered,
so
i
don't
know
what
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
relation
short.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
is
two
fold
mr.
justice
and
the
first
thing
is
that
the
state
believes
that
that
question
is
a
legal
question
which
is
best
reserved
for
the
judicial
processes
of
evidence
gathering,
evidence
presenting
the
legal
questions
involved
in
negligence,
last
clear
chance,
contributory
negligence
and
all
the
things
that
come
into
play.
in
this
particular
case
for
example,
you
have
got
a
child,
what's
the
due
care
--
what's
the
caring
part
of
a
child,
it's
a
legal
question
although
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
only
as
a
sanction
to
try
to
get
him
to
pose
a
security.
the
thing
that
the
state
is
interested
in
is
he's
posing
the
security
and
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
the
state
has
to
have
some
sanction
in
order
to
encourage
him
to
post
it
so
that
in
the
event
there
is
a
judgment,
it
will
not
be
an
empty
one.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
certainly
the
legislature
could
do
that
we
believe.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i'm
sorry,
the
state
hasn't
done
what?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
--
it
says
you
must
pose
security
but
it
doesn't
go
out
and
attach
anything
that's
correct.
the
alternative
is
up
to
the
motorist.
he
may
decide
not
to
post
security
but
then
the
alternative
is
that
he
is
going
to
lose
his
license
for
a
year
or
his
licenses
for
a
year
but
the
reason
that
they
--
the
suspension
provisions
are
in
there
are
to
encourage
people
to
put
up
the
security
and
the
states
interested
in
the
security
being
put
up
for
people
on
the
highways
and
not
really
in
suspending
his
license.
this
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
the
second
state
interest
is
the
procedural
problems
that
would
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
--
bring
up
and
to
have
these,
as
i
mentioned
in
the
latter
part
of
our
brief,
last
year,
over
18.000
of
these
--
cases
were
brought
up.
now,
there
wouldn't
be
18,000
hearings
necessarily,
there
would
have
been
although
this
figure
does
not
appear
in
our
brief,
about
13,000
situations
where
the
affidavit
and
the
report
that
is
the
claim
were
filed
and
the
30
days
elapsed
and
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
act
so
that
there
would
have
been
a
suspension
and
it's
those
13,000
that
probably
would
have
been
heard
before
the
suspension
request
would
have
been
made.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
that's
the
trigger.
if
there
is
a
claim
made
along
with
the
accident.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
true
mr.
justice
but
the
act
is
trying
to
reach
the
most
general
situation
and
that
would
be
--
it
would
be
outside
of
the
act
but
it
would
so
rarely
occur
that
--
the
state
is
trying
to
protect
those
people
who
are
on
the
highways
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
also
that
it's
the
state
that
put
those
drivers
on
the
highway.
it's
the
states
highways
and
the
state
is
licensing
them,
so
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
to
be
sure
that
it's
highways
are
kept
free
from
accident.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
because
in
the
first
place,
the
affidavit
must
be
filed
or
the
report
must
be
made
within
10
days
so
--
of
the
accident.
now,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
claim,
you
know
it
or
at
least
you're
going
to
say
that
you
believe
you're
liable
right
away
and
the
party
would
have
to
make
that
determination.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
of
course
if
he
will
settle,
that's
his
choice.
the
state
is
not
compelling
him
to
settle
either
but
if
he
has
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
until
it's
determined
in
court
correct
that
you
are
responsible
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right,
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
i
don't
know
whether
they
do
or
not
but
it's
a
determination
to
be
made
by
the
driver
himself
if
he
is
going
to
bear
the
risk
of
getting
involved
in
an
accident,
then
he
is
going
to
have
to
put
up
the
security.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well
of
course,
if
they
can't
put
up
a
bond,
then
they
are
probably
going
to
lose
their
license
for
a
period
of
one
year.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
would
have
to
do
that
if
they
were
unwilling
or
unable
to
put
up
the
bond.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
the
situation
is
this,
if
the
man
who
has
the
accident
is
a
poor
man
for
example
and
he
has
a
neighbor
who
has
a
property,
he
could
get
him
perhaps
put
up
a
property
bond
for
him,
he
doesn't
have
to
put
up
cash.
he
can
put
up
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
it's
a
condition
that's
put
on
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
as
far
as
equal
protection
is
concerned,
we're
interested
also
in
protecting
the
poor
person
who's
injured
on
the
highway
and
getting
him
compensated,
perhaps
he
has
no
funds
either
but
we
don't
think
that
this
raises
an
equal
protection
problem
because
the
states
delaying
of
the
requirement
for
security
which
would
be
akin
to
or
equal
to
insurance
if
he
had
insurance
is
to
the
benefit
of
the
poorer
person.
if
we
could
have
compulsory
insurance
that
everybody
had
to
have,
that
would
be
fine.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right.
and
what
were
saying
is
we're
favoring
those
who
are
poorer
and
who
may
not
have
the
money
to
buy
insurance,
by
delaying
it,
delaying
any
requirement
for
showing
financial
responsibility
until
you're
involved
in
an
accident.
so,
we
don't
think
that
that
favoritism
brings
up
an
equal
protection
problem
except
that
it's
perhaps
discriminatory
against
those
who
buy
insurance,
who
take
their
responsibility
from
the
beginning?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
a
divorce
that
a
case
should
he
on
a
high
level?
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
no,
not
necessarily.
i
think
here,
we've
got
persons
who
are
injured
on
the
state's
highways
and
if
the
person
doesn't
have
enough
money
to
post
the
security
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
that's
right,
there
certainly
is
but
we
don't
believe
that
there's
an
equal
protection
problem
here
and
of
course
it
is
not
one
at
issue
in
this
case.
it's
a
question
of
whether
there
is
due
process.
as
far
as
the
situation
of
the
other
states
having
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment.
we
believe
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing
for
(inaudible)
to
determine.
moreover,
georgia
is
not
compelled
to
accept
the
procedures
that
other
states
have
just
because
other
states
find
that
they're
good.
as
i
mentioned,
there
would
be
about
13,000
hearings
necessary
in
georgia,
whereas,
arizona
which
apparently
likes
this
system
that
is
suggested
by
the
petitioner
had
only
900.
so
that
the
situation
is
just
entirely
different
but
we
don't
believe
that
constitutional
due
process
would
require
us
to
adopt
arizona's
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
cases
that
are
cited
where
a
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment
are
discussed
are
the
basis
--
the
basis
of
those
cases
is
statutory
construction
and
not
constitutional
requirement,
not
mandate,
although
its
mentioned
in
some
manner.
the
states
are
saying,
well,
our
statute
state
responsibility
requires
there
to
be
a
consideration
of
fault
or
culpability
before
this
suspension.
so
that's
why
we're
requiring
it,
that's
true
in
the
california
cases,
the
arizona
cases
of
schecter
(ph),
it's
true
in
hage
(ph),
the
utah
case
and
its
true
in
arthur
or
in
williams
versus
sills,
the
new
jersey
case
of
last
year
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
new
jersey
case,
chief
justice
winthrop
of
that
state
suggested
in
his
concurring
short
opinion
that
he
saw
no
constitutional
problem
as
far
as
due
process
is
concerned,
that
it
was
and
he
recognized
it
as
being
a
statutory
requirement
there.
so
that
we
believe
there
is
no
due
process
requirement
for
a
consideration
of
fault
at
that
point
but
it
should
be
left
to
courts
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
could
with
a
preliminary
court
hearing
but
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
believe
that
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
we
think
we
have
that
to
a
degree
mr.
chief
justice
in
this
respect.
we
do
have
here
at
least
involvement
in
an
accident,
we're
sure
of
that,
no
insurance,
a
claim
made
with
affidavits
and
with
the
statements
of
the
attending
physicians
and
if
it
is
necessary,
other
evidence
of
damage
and
other
evidences
of
damage
so
that
we
think
we've
got
already
a
reasonable
possibility
of
judgment.
if
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
parties
involved
in
the
accident
and
we
don't
feel
that
the
department
is
in
a
position
to
make
that
judgment.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
yes
i
would
like,
thank
you
very
much
for
having
that
opportunity.
sniadach
of
course,
is
the
garnishment
case
and
in
that
case,
there
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
two
cases
mentioned
where
summary
proceedings
were
regarded
to
be
warranted
because
of
what
the
court
called
extraordinary
situations.
one
of
those
was
coffin
brothers
and
that
was
the
situation
in
which
the
bank
holders
or
the
bank
stockholders
were
assessed
after
the
bank
had
been
closed
for
the
purpose
of
paying
off
depositors.
and
the
assessment
was
made
and
execution
was
allowed
thereon
before
there
was
a
determination
in
court.
there
was
allowed
to
be
execution
and
due
process
was
raised
in
that
situation
and
the
court
felt
there
believed
that
that
was
an
extraordinary
situation
and
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
protect
the
depositors
this
way
and
it
was
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process
rather
to
require
the
stockholders
to
put
up
that
money
without
a
question
of
there
being
first
of
all
a
court
hearing.
and
i
think
it
was
very
important
to
this
case
that
in
coffin
brothers
of
course
which
is
cited
in
sniadach,
the
court
found
that
when
they
became
stockholders
they
agreed
to
do
this
and
it's
the
same
thing
when
you
become
a
driver
or
take
out
a
license.
you
agree
to
put
up
the
security
if
you're
involved
in
an
accident.
it's
a
condition
of
your
license,
just
like
obeying
the
other
traffic
laws
would
be
or
having
the
inspections
or
getting
tags.
it's
a
condition
that's
put
on
at
the
outset
and
that
was
one
of
the
differences
that
was
recognized
in
coffin
brothers.
now,
owenbee
(ph)
was
another
one
that
was
mentioned
and
that
involved
a
foreign
attachment
where
in
order
for
you
to
contest
or
to
defend
against
foreign
attachment,
you
had
to
put
up
security
before
any
determination
which
is
the
same
thing
as
we
have
here.
and
the
court
found
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
due
process.
now,
sniadach
with
the
garnishment
situation,
the
court
said
in
these
due
process
cases,
we've
got
to
look
at
two
things,
the
nature
of
the
property
and
the
problems
of
procedural
due
process
that
are
involved.
in
sniadach,
the
nature
of
the
property
was
the
man's
wages
and
the
court
regarded
that
as
a
fundamental
right
that
he
had
to
his
wages
without
the
state
stepping
in
to
help
a
creditor.
first,
we
think,
it's
very
different
when
we're
talking
about
posting
security
and
the
only
right
that
he's
deprived
of
there
is
the
right
to
the
interest
on
that
security
for
two
years,
now,
that's
a
right.

property,
it
could
be
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
could
be
his
property,
his
farm
or
someone
else's.
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
well,
they
probably
wouldn't
have
property
but
it's
a
condition
we
go
back
again
to
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
it
was
a
small
amount
i
believe
mr.
justice
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
but
you
were
taking
his
wages
prior
to
any
hearing,
he
had
no
control
over
it.
in
these
situations
where
you
have
a
driver's
license
which
is
conditioned
on
your
meeting
the
requirements
for
driver's
licenses.
one
of
the
conditions
is
get
insurance
or
be
willing
to
put
up
security
and
that's
not
analogous
to
a
wade
situation
where
a
man
goes
out
and
has
a
right
to
his
wages
without
any
interference
from
the
state
except
for
tax
withholding.
but
here,
the
whole
right
is
conditioned
on
a
privilege
which
is
given
by
the
state
and
which
maybe
conditioned
as
so
long
as
the
general
welfare
is
being
encouraged
thereby.
so
we
think
it's
different
from
sniadach
in
that
view.
also
again,
the
problems
of
procedural
due
process
was
another
view
or
another
matter
that
was
to
be
taken
up
as
the
court
did
in
sniadach
and
we
here
have
discussed
to
some
extent
the
problems
of
procedural
due
process
which
we
see
if
we
have
to
have
court
here
or
administrative
hearings
to
determine
fault.
so
--
ms.
dorothy
t.
beasley
thank
you
very
much.
