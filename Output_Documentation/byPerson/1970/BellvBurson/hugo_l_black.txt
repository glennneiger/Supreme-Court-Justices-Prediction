but
is
that
res
judicata
in
any
subsequent
negligence
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
no
--
do
i
understand
that
this
court
proceeding,
i
know
it
was
a
court
proceeding
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--is
still
part
of
the
administrative
procedure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
it
is
not
enough
of
a
court
proceeding
to
be
res
judicata
in
a
negligence
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
of
course
they're
not
parties
to
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
would
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
defense
could
he
make
for
not
giving
--
taking
insurance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
less
security?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
claimer
--
should
they
claim
a
$100,000.00,
you
just
put
up
the
bond
to
at
least
a
$100,000.00?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
are
lot
of
people
in
georgia
either
country
farmers
of
daily
laborers,
couldn't
put
up
a
bond
of
a
thousand
dollars,
what
would
you
do
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
take
the
license
away
from
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
unable
was
a
big
bond,
he
didn't
have
to
limit
himself
away,
couldn't
pay
a
thousand
dollars,
what
would
you
about
that
enabling,
would
you
let
him
make
a
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
told
you
that
the
man
cannot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
but
putting
up
a
bond
for
some
people
of
a
thousand
dollars
of
2000
or
5000
is
just
impossible
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
people
in
georgia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
physically
able
to
drive
his
car?
now,
what
do
you
do?
as
i
understand
it,
due
process
question
raises
an
equal
protection
about,
what
do
you
say
about
the
equal
protection
based
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
could
have
put
that
on
to
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
here
last
week
or
the
week
before,
the
person
who's
getting
a
divorce,
if
he's
done
to
have
any
money
that
way,
he
can't
be
made
to
pay
cost
of
his
divorce
proceeding.
do
you
think
the
divorce
case
should
be
on
a
high
basis
and
the
person
before
injury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
other
person
would
like
to
have
that
marriage
settled,
that's
pretty
important
too
isn't
it?
yes
it
is.
it
certainly
would
be
to
those
persons
that
are
involved.
i
think
it
depends
on
who
you're
looking
at
as
far
as
that's
concerned
but
there's
really
no
right,
constitutional
right
involved
in
driving
on
the
highway.
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law
isn't
it?
