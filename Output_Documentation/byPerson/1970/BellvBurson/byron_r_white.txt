justice
byron
r.
white
you
anticipate
that
if
you
prevailed
here,
that
georgia
would
change
its
law
to
require
insurance
as
a
condition
preceded?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
give
you
a
hearing
or
a
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
give
you
hearing
before
suspension?
but
you're
saying
here,
the
hearing
must
include
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
fault
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
wouldn't
you
think
the
state
that
have
rule
that
anytime
--
from
the
moment
anybody
gets
in
an
accident,
he
must
have
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
in
that
event,
all
you
would
have
is
some
kind
of
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
make
the
equal
protection
argument
that
the
defendant--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
basis
for
the
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
states
have
this
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
mean
this
particular
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
is
this
one
form
of
the
model
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
basis
of
the
state
choosing
this
system
rather
than
compulsory
insurance
supposedly?
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
rindskopf,
here
what
you
say,
or
a
complete
sentence
because
you
dropped
your
voice
all
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
doesn't
this
mean
that
you
and
i
have
to
pay
the
insurance
premium
increment
to
have
an
insured
motorist
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
there
some
states
that
have
unsatisfied
judgment
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
alternative
isn't
it
for
this
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
sealing
on
the
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
though
that
ultimately
the
driver
is
found
without
fault
in
an
action
between
the
injured
person
and
him,
that
all
(inaudible)
off
as
far
as
georgia
is
concerned
and
the
license
has
been
suspended,
it's
restored.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he's
put
up
a
bond,
the
bond
is
canceled,
and
he
is
under
no
obligation
to
buy
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
again,
if
he's
found
not
in
any
event,
if
he's
found
to
be
without
fault
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
suing
court
action,
he
is
right
back
to
where
he'd
started
from
in
the
first
place.
he
doesn't
have
to
keep
a
bond
up,
he
doesn't
have
to
buy
insurance
and
he
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--his
driver's
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
i
understand
that,
but
fault
so
fault
ultimately
is
a
very
relevant
factor
as
to
whether
or
not
his
license
is
suspended
or
restored?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
should
the
state
of
georgia
be
able
to
say
that
until
and
unless
five
or
six
months
or
a
year
from
now,
you
are
found
--
until
the
courts
acts,
we
are
automatically
going
to
suspend
your
license
without
regard
to
fault.
that's
the
real
question
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
defendant
says
i
don't
have
any
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
he
doesn't
have
--
no
money
for
that
either
and
you
don't
make
everybody
in
georgia
buy
insurance
in
that
form.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
says
if
you're
going
to
run
the
railroad
this
way,
you
really
were
at
fault
as
really
the
determining
factor
ultimately,
how
can
you
just
presume
it
and
suspend
my
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
--
certainly
a
court
is
and
here
there
was
a
court
--
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
court
finding
of
no
liability
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
was
a
judicial
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
just
said
it's
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
by
the
way,
is
the
license
--
has
his
drivers
license
actually
been
suspended?
justice
byron
r.
white
june
10,
1972.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
amendment
is
retroactive
then
he
gets
his
license
back
doesn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
he
has
it
but
let
me
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the,
it
wouldn't
even
until
june
10,
1972?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
--
where
is
that
dobson
case
pending?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
care
to
address
yourself
to
all
the
two
cases
in
our
court
in
which
of
course
snyder
act
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
anticipate
that
if

that
