mr.
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
secretary
of
transportation
opposes
this
stay
essentially
because
the
issues
to
be
presented
are
not
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
a
grant
for
certiorari.
i
will
confine
my
remarks
to
this
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
hanover,
counsel
for
commissioner
speight
will
then
discuss
the
effect
such
a
stay
would
have
on
the
respondents.
interstate
i-40,
we
have
been
told
--
mr.
reynolds
we
would
--
mr.
reynolds
not
necessarily
your
honor.
there
is
involved
in
the
stay
application,
the
question
of
whether
the
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
they
were
no
undisputed
facts
here,
and
therefore
supporting
summary
judgment
whether
that
was
a
correct
determination
and
there
is
--
mr.
reynolds
that
question
will
arise
--
mr.
reynolds
that's
correct.
that
question
may
be
considered
by
this
court
though
--
mr.
reynolds
that's
correct.
yes
your
honor.
interstate
i-40
will
cut
over
in
part
in
half
we're
told.
i
would
like
to
add
a
few
pertinent
facts
with
regard
to
that
contention.
this
map
shows
and
there
is
mark
on
map,
only
the
portion
of
the
highway
that
we
are
now
considering,
it
does
extend
on
out
at
the
present
time
to
the
ends
of
this
map.
the
route
will
run
along
what
is
an
existing
non-access
bus
road,
which
including
the
clear
right-of-way
on
either
side
is
presently
40
to
50
feet
wide.
along
the
north
edge
of
the
road
from
west
to
east
for
about
two-thirds
of
distance
of
the
bus
route
is
a
6
to
8
foot
chain-link
fence,
presently
separating
the
zoo
from
the
rest
of
the
park.
the
zoo
is
up
in
the
north
area
and
at
the
present
time
the
city
is
expanding
zoo
facilities
east.
in
the
north-east
corner
are
the
parking
lots
for
the
zoo,
which
the
city
anticipates
to
expand
and
improve.
thus
essentially
overton
park
is
south
of
the
bus
route.
that's
where
the
lake
is,
that's
where
the
golf
course
is,
that's
where
the
picnic
areas
are,
the
outdoor
theater,
the
art
galleries
and
most
of
the
woodland,
and
that
remains
untouched.
the
highway
itself
will
take
26
acres
of
the
342
acre
park,
and
it
will
involve
cutting
down
12
acres
of
trees
as
opposed
to
leaving
approximately
175
acres
untouched.
turning
to
the
determination,
secretary
boyd's
approval
in
1968
of
the
route
--
mr.
reynolds
now
secretary
boyd
approved
the
route
of
this
park
in
1968.
this
was
the
first
approval
after
enactment
of
section
4
(f)
department
of
transportation
act
which
has
this
specific
language
that
is
at
issue
here.
at
the
time
that
he
approved
the
route,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
chairman
of
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park.
he
explained
the
considerations
and
study
that
went
into
the
alternative
routes
at
length.
and
then
he
concluded
that
letter
with
this
statement,
“now,
that
the
decision
has
been
made
on
a
specific
alignment
for
the
route,
i
have
asked
mr.
bridwell,
who
is
a
federal
highway
administrator
to
develop
a
number
of
specific
design
alternatives,
in
order
to
minimize
damage
to
the
court
and
its
facilities”.
there
was
no
objection
at
that
time
by
petitioners.
no
suit
was
commenced,
and
there
was
no
request
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
reynolds
that
was
in
1968,
april
of
1968.
now
between
april
of
1968
and
november
of
1969,
the
state
purchased
the
right-of-way
from
a
point
where
the
alternates
diverge
in
the
main
route
on
the
map
up
to
the
edge
of
the
park
on
both
sides,
and
they
clear
that
right-of-way.
in
addition,
the
state
purchased
from
the
city,
the
26
acres
strip
for
$2
million.
and
in
addition,
the
state
highway
officials
held
design
hearings,
as
to
what
the
proper
design
should
be
of
the
highway
through
the
park.
on
november
5
1969,
after
enactment
of
section
138
in
the
federal-aid
highway
act,
secretary
volpe
announced,
“
the
hold
on
the
project
has
been
lifted,
after
the
state
agreed
to
adjust
the
grade
line
of
the
depressed
freeway
to
a
point
as
low
as
possible.”
and
that
press
release
further
stated,
“
the
state
has
also
agreed
to
take
all
steps
possible
to
minimize
the
harm
to
the
park
resulting
from
the
highway.”
mr.
reynolds
your
honor,
the
press
announcements
are
attachments
to
the
speight
affidavit,
the
letter
to
th
chairman
for
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
is
an
attachment
to
the
chairman's
affidavit
which
was
put
in,
in
this
case.
mr.
reynolds
your
honor
there
is
not
in
a
press
release
that
specific
language
--
mr.
reynolds
well,
if
i
may.
secretary
boyd
in
his
1968
press
release,
announced
that
they
--
he
had
approved
the
route
following
the
resolution
of
the
memphis
city
council.
that
resolution
reads
and
i
quite
in
pertinent
part
“whereas
representatives
of
the
federal
government
have
furnished
the
council
with
considerable
information
and
data
to
the
effect
that
no
other
feasible
and
prudent
route
is
available.
now
therefore
be
it
resolved
by
the
council,
that
the
council
finds
the
route
presently
designated
by
the
federal
government
through
overton
park
as
the
feasible
and
prudent
location
for
said
route
and
secretary
boyd
in
his
press
announcement
said,
that
he
was
approving
the
route
on
--
following
that
announcement.
mr.
reynolds
the
memphis
council
approved
it
as
--
mr.
reynolds
but
your
honor,
they
approved
it
as
the
feasible
and
prudent
alternative,
but
they
stated
whereas
they
had
been
shown
by
the
federal
government
that
there
were
no
other
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives
available.
the
federal
government
went
down
to
the
memphis
city
council,
they
explained
to
him
for
over
three-and-a-half
hours,
indeed
mr.
bridwell
did,
the
different
alternatives
routes
that
were
considered
has
possibly
prudent
and
feasible
and
discussed
with
the
memphis
city
council,
the
determination
as
to
prudent
and
feasible
routes,
and
i
add
that
there
was
--
mr.
reynolds
the
determination
itself,
your
honor?
mr.
reynolds
the
determination
itself
was
based
on
these
factors.
the
routes
we
show
here,
the
alternate
routes,
are
the
ones
that
have
been
most
predominantly
mentioned
in
throughout
the
deliberations
of
this
project.
mr.
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
i
will.
the
one
to
the
south
is
marked
number
2,
immediately
north
is
number
3
and
the
third
alternative
is
the
one
that
runs
in
a
triangular
shape.
as
to
the
route
directly
north,
it
was
determined
that,
that
would
involve
taking
three
schools
involving
south
western
university
and
the
largest
high
school
in
memphis.
it
would
involve
taking
several
churches,
attended
by
some
4,000
persons.
it
would
involve
taking
a
number
of
residential
units
of
more
than
1,500
persons.
the
route
to
the
south
of
the
park
--
mr.
reynolds
the
reason
that,
that
was
not
--
mr.
reynolds
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
i
am
suggesting
that
you
have
to
weigh
the
social
values
that
are
inherent
in
the
disruption
and
dislocation
of
individuals
and
industries
when
you
consider
whether
to
put
a
road
through
a
park
or
to
put
a
road
in
an
alternate
route.
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
we've
set
fourth,
the
senate
committee
report
which
is
part
of
the
legislative
history
and
it
states
specifically,
“
there
are
other
high
priority
items
which
must
also
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
the
committee
is
extremely
concerned
that
the
highway
program
be
carried
out
in
such
a
manner,
as
to
reduce
in
all
instances
the
harsh
impact
on
people
which
results
from
the
dislocation
and
displacement
by
reason
of
highway
construction.”
mr.
reynolds
they
said
this
–
they
then
go
on
to
say,
therefore
the
use
of
parkland
is
properly
protected
with
damage
minimized
by
the
most
sophisticated
construction
techniques
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
movement
of
large
numbers
of
people.
that
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
mr.
reynolds
in
the
act
itself?
mr.
reynolds
well,
the
congress
indicated
it
in
the
legislative
history
your
honor.
the
specific
language
says
that
they
shall
approve
–
not
approve
a
park
route
unless,
there
are
no
other
prudent
and
feasible
alternatives
and
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
that
was
considered?
whether
the
determination
was
made?
and
we
submit
that
it's
undisputed
on
this
record
that
the
determination
was
made?
mr.
reynolds
well,
your
honor
that
goes
to
the
arbitrary
in
capricious
standard,
where
the
standard
of
review
that
is
to
be
exercised
in
determining
the
secretary's
determination.
our
position
is
that,
it
is
the
secretary's
function
to
perform
to
make
the
determination,
and
this
court
is
to
then
decide
whether
that
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
reynolds
without
the,
excuse
me.
mr.
reynolds
without
the
administrative
record?
mr.
reynolds
your
honor,
i
believe
that
on
a
summary
judgment
motion,
if
there
are
no
facts
submitted
to
dispute
or
to
indicate
a
dispute
--
an
abuse
discretion
that
it
is
proper
to
determine
that
the
secretary
did
not
violate
that
reviewing
standard.
that
is
all
that
is
required
in
a
summary
judgment
motion.
mr.
reynolds
the
administrative
record
is
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
well,
it
is
available.
it
was
in
the
department
of
transportation,
it
was
shown
to
petitioner's
counsel
and
he
examined
the
administrative
record
and
sold
the
entire
record
on
which
the
secretary
based
his
opinion.
now,
there
is
a
allegation
made
that
their
additional
documents
in
tennessee.
and
that
is
very
well
true,
but
they
did
not,
they
were
not
considered
by
the
secretary
and
did
not
form
a
part
of
the
administrative
record
on
which
the
secretary
based
his
decision.
moreover
--
mr.
reynolds
you
have
the
statement
of
the
secretary
that
the
determinations
were
indeed
made
and
you
have
the
affidavits
showing
the
different
reasons
why
alternate
routes
were
rejected.
mr.
reynolds
the
reason,
your
honor
is
that,
that
it
was
decided
below
on
a
summary
judgment
motion
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits,
and
no
disputed
facts
were
introduced.
mr.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
reynolds
no
sir,
not,
it
was
not,
but
there
was
full
access
to
it
for
petitioner's
counsel
had
he
wished
to
present
it
in
order
to
show,
in
any
way
that
the
determination
was
not
made
properly.
mr.
reynolds
that
was
decided
upon
in
1968,
april
of
1968
and
that
is
in
the
record
your
honor.
and
the
petitioners
received
a
letter
from
the
secretary
himself
which
i
quoted
in
part,
telling
them
at
that
time
that
the
determination
had
made
that
the
route
would
run
through
overton
park.
mr.
reynolds
in
november
of
1969
when
the
design
was
approved,
that
is
correct,
the
land
had
been
cleared
to
the
edge
of
the
park
on
both
sides.
mr.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
reynolds
of
what?
the
route
was
established
in
1968
--
mr.
reynolds
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
route
other
than
to
go
through
the
park.
mr.
reynolds
then
moving
party
here
your
honor
has
not
suggested
any
issue
which
would
warrant
a
grant
of
certiorari
by
this
court.
mr.
reynolds
well,
your
honor
they
bids
have
been
entered
on
this
job.
mr.
reynolds
yes,
and
their
low
bid
has
been
accepted,
that
is
in
the
--
mr.
reynolds
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
that
was
in
november
of
1969
i
believe,
of
1967.
november,
1967.
mr.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon,
what?
mr.
reynolds
yes
there
was
--
the
contact
was
let.
mr.
reynolds
but
the
clearing
had
taken
place
between
1968
and
1969.
mr.
reynolds
i
believe
that's
right.
yes.
that
what
--
that's
all
i
say.
mr.
reynolds
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
reynolds
well,
your
honor
i
don't
believe
the
question
before
this
court
is
to
decide
what
might
be
a
possible
prudent
reasonable
alternative
route
or
a
possible
better
design,
but
rather
just
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
any
issues
in
this
case
that
should
be
determined
by
this
court
to
warrant
a
grant
of
certiorari.
mr.
reynolds
in
memphis,
for
time
being?
there
are
in
number,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number.
the
city
has
purchased
a
160-acre
park
which
has
a
golf
course
on
it,
with
the
money
that
they
received
from
the
state.
they
have
--
in
addition
they
expect
to
purchase
another
140
acres
in
and
around
memphis,
for
--
with
this
money.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
by
the
merits
you
mean
decide
the
petition
question?
mr.
reynolds
let
me
just
say
i
do
not
have
problem
on
that
your
honor.
however
the
application
for
a
stay
do
not
raise
this,
as
one
of
the
issues
to
be
presented
to
this
court.
the
question
is
to
whether
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
should
be
applied
or
the
substantial
evidence
standard
should
be
applied
and
that
issue
was
briefed
in
their
brief
which
we
do
not
have
the
benefit
of
seeing
before
we
submitted
our
brief.
i
believe
that
we
would
like
if
the
court
feels
that
might
be
one
of
the
issues
that
they
would
want
to
grant
the
certiorari
on,
however
i
believe
we
would
like
to
have
an
opportunity
to
brief
that
point
unless
i
could
speak
to
it
now.
mr.
reynolds
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
sorry
i
did
not
understand
the
question.
i
thought
he
meant
would
i
be
willing
to
have
--
mr.
reynolds
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
you
meant
would
we
be
willing
to
have
our
brief
treated
as
an
opposition
to
what
is
purposed
as
i
believe
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
that
is
their
brief,
and
my
answer
to
that
question
is
the
one
i
gave.
i
don't
believe
we
would
be
willing
to
do
the
other.
mr.
reynolds
his
question
as
to
the
brief
on
the
merits
yes
your
honor,
that
is
–
that
answer
is
no.
we
would
be
willing
to
have
it
treated
as
an
opposition
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
except
with
the
one
reservation
that
i
mentioned
if
that
is
decided.
mr.
reynolds
if
that
were
granted
your
honor
--
mr.
reynolds
if
it
were
granted
and
there
were
a
stay
i
would
prefer
to
have
an
opportunity
to
brief
the
merits.
i
would
agree
to
expedited
schedule
in
accordance
with
the
suggestion
of
this
court,
but
i
do
believe
if
we
get
to
that
stage
that
at
that
point
we
would
want
an
opportunity
to
brief
the
merits.
mr.
reynolds
we
have
introduced
ourselves
only
to
the
question
of
whether
this
court
should
grant
certiorari.
mr.
reynolds
i
may
well
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
have
time
to
consider
the
question
as
to
what
additional
information
on
the
merits
and
i
would
agree
to
an
expedited
briefing
schedule
if
we
get
to
that
stage.
i
believe
at
the
present
time
that
we
would
be
willing
to
have
our
brief
treated
as
an
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
secretary
of
transportation
opposes
this
stay
essentially
because
the
issues
to
be
presented
are
not
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
a
grant
for
certiorari.
i
will
confine
my
remarks
to
this
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
hanover,
counsel
for
commissioner
speight
will
then
discuss
the
effect
such
a
stay
would
have
on
the
respondents.
interstate
i-40,
we
have
been
told
--
mr.
reynolds
we
would
--
mr.
reynolds
not
necessarily
your
honor.
there
is
involved
in
the
stay
application,
the
question
of
whether
the
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
they
were
no
undisputed
facts
here,
and
therefore
supporting
summary
judgment
whether
that
was
a
correct
determination
and
there
is
--
mr.
reynolds
that
question
will
arise
--
mr.
reynolds
that's
correct.
that
question
may
be
considered
by
this
court
though
--
mr.
reynolds
that's
correct.
yes
your
honor.
interstate
i-40
will
cut
over
in
part
in
half
we're
told.
i
would
like
to
add
a
few
pertinent
facts
with
regard
to
that
contention.
this
map
shows
and
there
is
mark
on
map,
only
the
portion
of
the
highway
that
we
are
now
considering,
it
does
extend
on
out
at
the
present
time
to
the
ends
of
this
map.
the
route
will
run
along
what
is
an
existing
non-access
bus
road,
which
including
the
clear
right-of-way
on
either
side
is
presently
40
to
50
feet
wide.
along
the
north
edge
of
the
road
from
west
to
east
for
about
two-thirds
of
distance
of
the
bus
route
is
a
6
to
8
foot
chain-link
fence,
presently
separating
the
zoo
from
the
rest
of
the
park.
the
zoo
is
up
in
the
north
area
and
at
the
present
time
the
city
is
expanding
zoo
facilities
east.
in
the
north-east
corner
are
the
parking
lots
for
the
zoo,
which
the
city
anticipates
to
expand
and
improve.
thus
essentially
overton
park
is
south
of
the
bus
route.
that's
where
the
lake
is,
that's
where
the
golf
course
is,
that's
where
the
picnic
areas
are,
the
outdoor
theater,
the
art
galleries
and
most
of
the
woodland,
and
that
remains
untouched.
the
highway
itself
will
take
26
acres
of
the
342
acre
park,
and
it
will
involve
cutting
down
12
acres
of
trees
as
opposed
to
leaving
approximately
175
acres
untouched.
turning
to
the
determination,
secretary
boyd's
approval
in
1968
of
the
route
--
mr.
reynolds
now
secretary
boyd
approved
the
route
of
this
park
in
1968.
this
was
the
first
approval
after
enactment
of
section
4
(f)
department
of
transportation
act
which
has
this
specific
language
that
is
at
issue
here.
at
the
time
that
he
approved
the
route,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
chairman
of
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park.
he
explained
the
considerations
and
study
that
went
into
the
alternative
routes
at
length.
and
then
he
concluded
that
letter
with
this
statement,
“now,
that
the
decision
has
been
made
on
a
specific
alignment
for
the
route,
i
have
asked
mr.
bridwell,
who
is
a
federal
highway
administrator
to
develop
a
number
of
specific
design
alternatives,
in
order
to
minimize
damage
to
the
court
and
its
facilities”.
there
was
no
objection
at
that
time
by
petitioners.
no
suit
was
commenced,
and
there
was
no
request
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
reynolds
that
was
in
1968,
april
of
1968.
now
between
april
of
1968
and
november
of
1969,
the
state
purchased
the
right-of-way
from
a
point
where
the
alternates
diverge
in
the
main
route
on
the
map
up
to
the
edge
of
the
park
on
both
sides,
and
they
clear
that
right-of-way.
in
addition,
the
state
purchased
from
the
city,
the
26
acres
strip
for
$2
million.
and
in
addition,
the
state
highway
officials
held
design
hearings,
as
to
what
the
proper
design
should
be
of
the
highway
through
the
park.
on
november
5
1969,
after
enactment
of
section
138
in
the
federal-aid
highway
act,
secretary
volpe
announced,
“
the
hold
on
the
project
has
been
lifted,
after
the
state
agreed
to
adjust
the
grade
line
of
the
depressed
freeway
to
a
point
as
low
as
possible.”
and
that
press
release
further
stated,
“
the
state
has
also
agreed
to
take
all
steps
possible
to
minimize
the
harm
to
the
park
resulting
from
the
highway.”
mr.
reynolds
your
honor,
the
press
announcements
are
attachments
to
the
speight
affidavit,
the
letter
to
th
chairman
for
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
is
an
attachment
to
the
chairman's
affidavit
which
was
put
in,
in
this
case.
mr.
reynolds
your
honor
there
is
not
in
a
press
release
that
specific
language
--
mr.
reynolds
well,
if
i
may.
secretary
boyd
in
his
1968
press
release,
announced
that
they
--
he
had
approved
the
route
following
the
resolution
of
the
memphis
city
council.
that
resolution
reads
and
i
quite
in
pertinent
part
“whereas
representatives
of
the
federal
government
have
furnished
the
council
with
considerable
information
and
data
to
the
effect
that
no
other
feasible
and
prudent
route
is
available.
now
therefore
be
it
resolved
by
the
council,
that
the
council
finds
the
route
presently
designated
by
the
federal
government
through
overton
park
as
the
feasible
and
prudent
location
for
said
route
and
secretary
boyd
in
his
press
announcement
said,
that
he
was
approving
the
route
on
--
following
that
announcement.
mr.
reynolds
the
memphis
council
approved
it
as
--
mr.
reynolds
but
your
honor,
they
approved
it
as
the
feasible
and
prudent
alternative,
but
they
stated
whereas
they
had
been
shown
by
the
federal
government
that
there
were
no
other
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives
available.
the
federal
government
went
down
to
the
memphis
city
council,
they
explained
to
him
for
over
three-and-a-half
hours,
indeed
mr.
bridwell
did,
the
different
alternatives
routes
that
were
considered
has
possibly
prudent
and
feasible
and
discussed
with
the
memphis
city
council,
the
determination
as
to
prudent
and
feasible
routes,
and
i
add
that
there
was
--
mr.
reynolds
the
determination
itself,
your
honor?
mr.
reynolds
the
determination
itself
was
based
on
these
factors.
the
routes
we
show
here,
the
alternate
routes,
are
the
ones
that
have
been
most
predominantly
mentioned
in
throughout
the
deliberations
of
this
project.
mr.
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
i
will.
the
one
to
the
south
is
marked
number
2,
immediately
north
is
number
3
and
the
third
alternative
is
the
one
that
runs
in
a
triangular
shape.
as
to
the
route
directly
north,
it
was
determined
that,
that
would
involve
taking
three
schools
involving
south
western
university
and
the
largest
high
school
in
memphis.
it
would
involve
taking
several
churches,
attended
by
some
4,000
persons.
it
would
involve
taking
a
number
of
residential
units
of
more
than
1,500
persons.
the
route
to
the
south
of
the
park
--
mr.
reynolds
the
reason
that,
that
was
not
--
mr.
reynolds
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
no,
your
honor,
i
am
suggesting
that
you
have
to
weigh
the
social
values
that
are
inherent
in
the
disruption
and
dislocation
of
individuals
and
industries
when
you
consider
whether
to
put
a
road
through
a
park
or
to
put
a
road
in
an
alternate
route.
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
we've
set
fourth,
the
senate
committee
report
which
is
part
of
the
legislative
history
and
it
states
specifically,
“
there
are
other
high
priority
items
which
must
also
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
the
committee
is
extremely
concerned
that
the
highway
program
be
carried
out
in
such
a
manner,
as
to
reduce
in
all
instances
the
harsh
impact
on
people
which
results
from
the
dislocation
and
displacement
by
reason
of
highway
construction.”
mr.
reynolds
they
said
this
–
they
then
go
on
to
say,
therefore
the
use
of
parkland
is
properly
protected
with
damage
minimized
by
the
most
sophisticated
construction
techniques
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
movement
of
large
numbers
of
people.
that
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
mr.
reynolds
in
the
act
itself?
mr.
reynolds
well,
the
congress
indicated
it
in
the
legislative
history
your
honor.
the
specific
language
says
that
they
shall
approve
–
not
approve
a
park
route
unless,
there
are
no
other
prudent
and
feasible
alternatives
and
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
that
was
considered?
whether
the
determination
was
made?
and
we
submit
that
it's
undisputed
on
this
record
that
the
determination
was
made?
mr.
reynolds
well,
your
honor
that
goes
to
the
arbitrary
in
capricious
standard,
where
the
standard
of
review
that
is
to
be
exercised
in
determining
the
secretary's
determination.
our
position
is
that,
it
is
the
secretary's
function
to
perform
to
make
the
determination,
and
this
court
is
to
then
decide
whether
that
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
reynolds
without
the,
excuse
me.
mr.
reynolds
without
the
administrative
record?
mr.
reynolds
your
honor,
i
believe
that
on
a
summary
judgment
motion,
if
there
are
no
facts
submitted
to
dispute
or
to
indicate
a
dispute
--
an
abuse
discretion
that
it
is
proper
to
determine
that
the
secretary
did
not
violate
that
reviewing
standard.
that
is
all
that
is
required
in
a
summary
judgment
motion.
mr.
reynolds
the
administrative
record
is
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
well,
it
is
available.
it
was
in
the
department
of
transportation,
it
was
shown
to
petitioner's
counsel
and
he
examined
the
administrative
record
and
sold
the
entire
record
on
which
the
secretary
based
his
opinion.
now,
there
is
a
allegation
made
that
their
additional
documents
in
tennessee.
and
that
is
very
well
true,
but
they
did
not,
they
were
not
considered
by
the
secretary
and
did
not
form
a
part
of
the
administrative
record
on
which
the
secretary
based
his
decision.
moreover
--
mr.
reynolds
you
have
the
statement
of
the
secretary
that
the
determinations
were
indeed
made
and
you
have
the
affidavits
showing
the
different
reasons
why
alternate
routes
were
rejected.
mr.
reynolds
the
reason,
your
honor
is
that,
that
it
was
decided
below
on
a
summary
judgment
motion
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits,
and
no
disputed
facts
were
introduced.
mr.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
reynolds
no
sir,
not,
it
was
not,
but
there
was
full
access
to
it
for
petitioner's
counsel
had
he
wished
to
present
it
in
order
to
show,
in
any
way
that
the
determination
was
not
made
properly.
mr.
reynolds
that
was
decided
upon
in
1968,
april
of
1968
and
that
is
in
the
record
your
honor.
and
the
petitioners
received
a
letter
from
the
secretary
himself
which
i
quoted
in
part,
telling
them
at
that
time
that
the
determination
had
made
that
the
route
would
run
through
overton
park.
mr.
reynolds
in
november
of
1969
when
the
design
was
approved,
that
is
correct,
the
land
had
been
cleared
to
the
edge
of
the
park
on
both
sides.
mr.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
reynolds
of
what?
the
route
was
established
in
1968
--
mr.
reynolds
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
route
other
than
to
go
through
the
park.
mr.
reynolds
then
moving
party
here
your
honor
has
not
suggested
any
issue
which
would
warrant
a
grant
of
certiorari
by
this
court.
mr.
reynolds
well,
your
honor
they
bids
have
been
entered
on
this
job.
mr.
reynolds
yes,
and
their
low
bid
has
been
accepted,
that
is
in
the
--
mr.
reynolds
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
that
was
in
november
of
1969
i
believe,
of
1967.
november,
1967.
mr.
reynolds
i
beg
your
pardon,
what?
mr.
reynolds
yes
there
was
--
the
contact
was
let.
mr.
reynolds
but
the
clearing
had
taken
place
between
1968
and
1969.
mr.
reynolds
i
believe
that's
right.
yes.
that
what
--
that's
all
i
say.
mr.
reynolds
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
reynolds
well,
your
honor
i
don't
believe
the
question
before
this
court
is
to
decide
what
might
be
a
possible
prudent
reasonable
alternative
route
or
a
possible
better
design,
but
rather
just
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
any
issues
in
this
case
that
should
be
determined
by
this
court
to
warrant
a
grant
of
certiorari.
mr.
reynolds
in
memphis,
for
time
being?
there
are
in
number,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number.
the
city
has
purchased
a
160-acre
park
which
has
a
golf
course
on
it,
with
the
money
that
they
received
from
the
state.
they
have
--
in
addition
they
expect
to
purchase
another
140
acres
in
and
around
memphis,
for
--
with
this
money.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
by
the
merits
you
mean
decide
the
petition
question?
mr.
reynolds
let
me
just
say
i
do
not
have
problem
on
that
your
honor.
however
the
application
for
a
stay
do
not
raise
this,
as
one
of
the
issues
to
be
presented
to
this
court.
the
question
is
to
whether
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
should
be
applied
or
the
substantial
evidence
standard
should
be
applied
and
that
issue
was
briefed
in
their
brief
which
we
do
not
have
the
benefit
of
seeing
before
we
submitted
our
brief.
i
believe
that
we
would
like
if
the
court
feels
that
might
be
one
of
the
issues
that
they
would
want
to
grant
the
certiorari
on,
however
i
believe
we
would
like
to
have
an
opportunity
to
brief
that
point
unless
i
could
speak
to
it
now.
mr.
reynolds
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reynolds
sorry
i
did
not
understand
the
question.
i
thought
he
meant
would
i
be
willing
to
have
--
mr.
reynolds
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
you
meant
would
we
be
willing
to
have
our
brief
treated
as
an
opposition
to
what
is
purposed
as
i
believe
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
that
is
their
brief,
and
my
answer
to
that
question
is
the
one
i
gave.
i
don't
believe
we
would
be
willing
to
do
the
other.
mr.
reynolds
his
question
as
to
the
brief
on
the
merits
yes
your
honor,
that
is
–
that
answer
is
no.
we
would
be
willing
to
have
it
treated
as
an
opposition
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
except
with
the
one
reservation
that
i
mentioned
if
that
is
decided.
mr.
reynolds
if
that
were
granted
your
honor
--
mr.
reynolds
if
it
were
granted
and
there
were
a
stay
i
would
prefer
to
have
an
opportunity
to
brief
the
merits.
i
would
agree
to
expedited
schedule
in
accordance
with
the
suggestion
of
this
court,
but
i
do
believe
if
we
get
to
that
stage
that
at
that
point
we
would
want
an
opportunity
to
brief
the
merits.
mr.
reynolds
we
have
introduced
ourselves
only
to
the
question
of
whether
this
court
should
grant
certiorari.
mr.
reynolds
i
may
well
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
have
time
to
consider
the
question
as
to
what
additional
information
on
the
merits
and
i
would
agree
to
an
expedited
briefing
schedule
if
we
get
to
that
stage.
i
believe
at
the
present
time
that
we
would
be
willing
to
have
our
brief
treated
as
an
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
