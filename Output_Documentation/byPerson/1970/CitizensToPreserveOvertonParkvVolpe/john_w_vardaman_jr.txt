mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
today
on
an
application
for
stay,
pending
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
we
seek
an
application
to
stay
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
secretary
of
transportation
and
the
commissioner
and
the
department
of
highways
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
from
authorizing
the
beginning
of
construction
of
a
six-lane
interstate
highway
which
will
pass
through
overton
park,
a
large
public
park
located
in
memphis,
tennessee.
if
this
stay
is
not
granted,
the
respondents
will
authorize
construction,
and
that
construction
will
proceed
before
this
court
has
an
opportunity
to
act
on
a
petition
for
certiorari.
that
construction
will
inflict
grave
and
irreparable
damage
to
the
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
we
have
until
the
january
28,
i
believe,
towards
the
end
of
january.
however,
as
we
suggested
in
the
brief
which
we've
filed,
we
are
willing
to
have
the
court
act
upon
these
papers
as
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
can
meet
the
formal
requirements
by
filing
the
petition
with
the
court.
we
are
ready
to
proceed
immediately.
we
have
not
filed
a
petition
thus
far
because
there
is
the
threat,
if
the
stay
is
not
granted
proportions
of
the
case
maybe
mooting.
we're
willing
to
proceed
immediately
with
the
filing
of
the
petition.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
if
the
respondents
are
permitted
to
proceed
with
this
construction,
they
may
likely
moot
this
case.
if
they
do,
they
would
have
been
successful
without
ever
having
filed
an
answer
to
the
petitioner's
complaint,
without
putting
one
witness
on
the
witness
stand,
without
having
one
of
their
officials
subject
to
examination
by
deposition,
but
instead
on
a
basis,
out
of
court,
the
litigation
affidavits,
filed
in
support
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that's
the
record
in
this
case.
so,
the
decision
below
is
based
solely
on
affidavits.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
which
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
case
arises
under
a
statute
passed
in
1966
which
articulates
a
national
policy
for
preserving
park
lands,
recreation
areas,
historic
sites,
waterfowl
and
wildlife
refuges.
that
statute
provides
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
shall
not
approve
any
project
which
affects
a
parkland
or
recreation
area,
unless
there
are
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives,
or
unless
the
design
of
the
project
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm.
the
park
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
large
342
acre
public
park
located
in
memphis,
tennessee.
it
has
within
it
approximately
a
170-acres
of
woodland
forest.
as
of
1965,
it's
constituted
one-half,
of
the
city
of
memphis;
memphis's
woodland
forest.
if
this
highway
goes
through
that
part
of
the
park,
according
to
department
of
interior
officials
who
proposed
this
project,
there
will
be
very
little
left
of
the
woodland
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
we're
willing,
yes,
we
are
willing
to
treat
this
argument
as
an
argument
on
the
merits
as
well.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
we
are
--
we
are
--
if
the
the
court
would
like
to
consider
this
as
an
argument
on
the
merit,
we're
willing
to
have
it
treated
that.
this
highway
project
involves
a
construction
of
the
six-lane
interstate
highway
with
the
right
of
way
between
250
feet
and
450
feet
wide.
as
it
proceeds
through
the
wooded
area
of
the
park,
if
it's
constructed,
as
it's
presently
planned,
it
will
take
a
swath
of
450
feet
out
of
the
wooded
section,
and
pass
through
a
small
picturesque
lake
and
a
pond.
it
will
pass
immediately
adjacent
to
the
zoo,
and
it
will
be
a
literal
barrier
to
either
side
of
the
park.
it'll
literally
cut
this
park
in
two.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
i
think
that's
an
undisputed
fact
that
on
this
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
figures
in
this
record
are
that
to
tunnel
it
and
they
suggest
two
types
of
tunnels,
it
would
cost,
they
estimate,
they
don't
have
any
calculations,
they
are
estimates,
would
cost
up
to
$40
million.
there
is
however,
a
suggestion
that
was
made
by
the
department
of
interior
officials
for
fully
depressed
ground
which
would
not
be
a
tunnel,
and
there
are
no
cost
figures
on
that
design.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
think
there
is
an
estimate
of
$40
million
but
that
involves
first
fully
depressing
and
then
totally
covering
it.
what
is
known
as
i
understand
is
a
cut-and-covered
tunnel.
but,
if
you
simply
depressed
it
all
the
way
through
the
park,
that
would
minimize
harm
to
the
park,
but
there
are
no
cost
figures
on
that.
and
my
point,
incidentally
they
have
raised
an
objection
that
this
would
create
certain
drainage
problems
within
--
there's
a
small
creek
which
runs
through
the
park,
and
they
maintain
that
this
--
it
can't
go
pass
that
creek
where
the
depressed
ground.
there
are
affidavits
on
file,
in
this
case
which
suggest
that
difficulty
could
be
overcome
by
standard
engineering
techniques
which
are
use
in
the
interstate
system,
just
today,
have
been
in
use
in
the
interstate
system
for
sometime,
if
they
refused
to
use
them
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
acreage
of
the
park
is
your
honor
is
342
acres.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
26
centrally
located
acres,
would
be
taken.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
problem
with
that
is,
is
that
the
stream
is
only
slightly
west
of
the
center
of
the
park
and
they
actually
go
above
grade
at
that
point.
so,
although
they
depress
it
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
park,
as
it
rises
to
that
portion
of
above
grade
for
a
substantial
part
of
it's
nearly
at
grade
and
you
have
to
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
this
is
part
of
a
cross
continental
east-west
interstate.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
park
lies
practically
in
the
middle
of
the
city,
if
you
look
at
the
map
of
memphis.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
this
park
is
practically
in
the
middle
of
the
city.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
zoo
–
and
this
highway
will
run
adjacent
to
the
southern
boundary
of
the
zoo.
this
highway
was
approved
in
november
1969.
this
action
was
filed
immediately
thereafter.
prior
to
the
time
this
highway
was
approved
there
was
a
study
of
several
alternative
routes,
one
which
would
swing
immediately
to
the
north
of
the
park,
and
one
which
would
swing
immediately
to
the
south
of
the
park.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
mr.
reynolds
will
bring
a
map
in
the
court
during
his
argument.
he'll
show
you
the
bands
on
the
map,
where
these
alternatives
would
go.
now,
in
the
department
of
transportation,
in
the
secretary's
papers
which
are
on
file,
he's
maintained
that
those
alternatives
were
rejected
because
of
large
displacement
of
persons
and
businesses.
in
his
affidavit,
he
gives
you
some
statistics,
as
to
the
number
of
people
who'd
be
displaced
by
the
route
which
goes
to
north
and
that
which
goes
to
the
south.
what
he
doesn't
give
you
in
the
affidavit
is
the
number
of
people
who'd
be
adversely
affected
not
only
in
the
use
of
the
park
but
in
their
home's
and
businesses
by
the
route
which
uses
the
park.
and
when
you
search
the
record
further
and
find
those
statistics,
they
demonstrate
that
the
alternative
to
the
north
of
the
park
which
he
rejected
actually
either
displaces
more
people
from
their
homes
or
adversely
affects
people
in
their
businesses
or
schools.
so,
the
test
which
he
asserts,
he's
applied
in
this
case,
was
mis-applied,
if
the
test
is
the
number
of
people
who'd
be
adversely
affected,
or
the
number
of
people
who
will
be
displaced
from
their
homes.
the
route
to
the
north
according
to
their
own
calculation
will
either
displace
or
adversely
affect
2386
people
and
route
through
the
park
according
to
their
own
figures,
will
adversely
affect
to
displace
2607
people,
actually
more
people
than
the
route
to
the
north.
and
this
is
the
case,
even
though
in
their
calculation
they've
made
no
allowance
for
the
people,
they've
not
counted
as
adversely
affected
people
who
use
the
park.
for
instance,
over
a
million
people
a
year
use
this
zoo,
and
they
haven't
calculated
the
effect
on
those
people.
further
more
this
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
some
of
them
may
stop
using
the
park,
some
of
them
may
not
but
one
of
the
problems
in
trying
to
use
mathematical
formulas
in
a
dispute
of
this
kind
is
that
it's
difficult
to
quantify
the
values
of
a
parkland,
and
that's
what
the
one
of
the
reasons
this
statute
was
passed.
decisions
have
been
made
on
locating
kind
of
ways
on
the
basis
of
cost
and
residences
dislocated,
and
where
you
have
decisions
to
made
that
way,
it
was
the
values
of
the
parkland,
the
aesthetic
values,
the
recreational
values
were
often
overlooked
and
that
was
one
of
the
motivating
forces
for
passage
of
this
act.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
it's
hard,
the
record
--
the
record
shows
that
that
construction
began
in
1967.
they
authorized
to
the
acquisition
the
right-of-way.
they
began
to
acquire
it
also
by
parcel.
by
1968
the
record
shows
that
much
of
it
had
been
acquired.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
your
honor
at
that
time
the
secretary
of
transportation,
in
a
letter
to
the
president
of
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
stated
that
the
federal
highway
administrator
had
told
the
memphis
city
council
in
the
april
of
1968
that
the
department
of
transportation
has
no
final
decision
from
the
location
of
this
highway.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
of
this
case.
the
final
decision
which
made
in
1969,
november
of
1969,
a
previous
decision
that
whether
that
was
a
type
of
decision
that
couldn't
have
been
changed,
is
simply
is
not
clear
from
this
record.
at
that
time
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
it
certainly
would
have,
that's
exactly
what
we
saw,
declaratory
injunction
--
the
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction.
i
understand
it
your
honor,
it
is
trouble
by
the
point
of
granting
an
injunction
against
this
highway
where
there
has
been
clearing
of
this
right-of-way
up
to
the
park,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
sequence
of
a
events
here.
they
began
clearing
that
right
away
fully
two
years
before
any
final
decision
was
made,
and
much
of
it
was
acquired
at
the
time
the
department
of
transportation
was
saying
we
have
no
final
decision
on
this
matter.
that
if
the
secretary
is
to
be
allowed
thwart
any
review
of
his
decisions
by
this
piecemeal
acquisition
of
right-of-way
of
right
up
to
the
park,
then
the
administration
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
statute,
is
whittled
away.
because
every
time
he
has
a
controversy
of
project,
it
will
be
possible
to
box
himself
in,
or
box
according
to
present
you
with
a
(inaudible),
simply
by
acquiring
the
right-of-way
right
to
the
park,
before
he
ever
approves
the
park
which
involves
the
park.
and
i
would
point
that
it's
only
once
he
approves
that
segment
that
citizens
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute,
under
which
this
action
was
brought.
and
where
there
has
to
be
a
final
agency
action
involving
a
park
before
we
can
bring
this
suit
and
obtain
the
review.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
and
therefore
our
cause
of
action
didn't
accrue
until
november
1969
and
we
are
then
met
with
the
defense
well
we
have
acquire
this
right-of-way
by
--
before
approving
the
section
which
involves
the
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
now
the
first
issue
we
have
maintained
throughout
that
it
is
a
disputed
issue
of
fact,
but
we
have
framed
it,
in
presenting
at
to
this
court,
we
have
framed
it
a
little
differently.
it's
undisputed
that
at
the
time
we
made
these
decisions
there
was
no
contemporaneous
documentation.
he
never
made
a
record
of
that
and
we
maintain
that
even
if
he
made
a
minimal
finding
simply
decided
in
his
own
mind,
that
that's
inadequate
here.
we
also
maintain
that
he
never
made
such
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
think
at
first
point,
i
think,
it
would
be
mooted.
we
would
then
proceed
to
whether
or
not
the
finding,
the
determination
was
infirm.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does
your
honor.
and
let
me
point
out
that,
there
is
one
contemporaneous
document,
which
he
produced
the
your
honor,
and
that's
a
press
release.
we
litigated
this
case
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
and
he
hasn't
done
so,
not
in
the
explicit
terms
which
i
think
this
court
should
demand
in
order
to
review
what
he
did,
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
one
point
involving
the
press
release.
he
seems
to
take
the
position
that
he
felt
the
route
had
been
determined,
and
as
whether
he
made
any
decisions
as
to
alternative
routes,
i
think
is
open
to
questions.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
his
decision,
that
is
--
that
is
an
additional
point.
the
second
point
which
could
possibly
also
be
mooted
if
he
gave
a
satisfactory
written
determination,
although
i
wouldn't
concede
it
would
be
mooted,
is
that
the
court
below
held
even
though
the
secretary
made
no
documentation
of
his
finding
that
this
court's
decision
in
morgan,
united
states
against
morgan
prohibit
any
inquiry
of
the
secretary
as
to
whether
he
did
make
the
finding.
and
the
difficultly
which
is
presented
to
anyone
seeking
review
under
the
statute,
seeking
enforcement
of
the
statute
under
the
holdings
below,
is
that
the
first
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
record
the
fact
that
he
made
the
determination
required
by
statute,
and
those
seeking
review
aren't
entitled
to
ask
him
whether
he
made
it.
the
court
below
simply
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
how
those
who
seek
review
or
to
have
it
be
able
to
determine
whether
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
affidavit
has
been
construed
that
way.
it
is
much
less
than
clear
from
that
affidavit
that
he
made
these
decisions,
and
we
have
contended
throughout
that
there
is
a
dispute
on
that
issue.
the
affidavit
is
set
out
partly
in
the
briefs,
and
it's
the
record,
i
won't
go
through
it
word
by
word.
rather
than
saying
the
secretary
made
a
decision,
there
being
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives
which
he
could
have
said,
had
he
made
the
determination,
the
affidavit
is
too
much
is
very,
very
vague.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
we
think
that
proper
standard
in
this
case
is
that
suggested
by
judge
celebrezze
below,
whether
it
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
substantial
evidence
test
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
required
where
there
has
been
a
hearing
required
by
statute
and
there
are
hearings
in
this
case
which
are
required
by
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
by
him,
that's
correct,
but
there
are
statute
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
he
doesn't,
no
but
the
transcripts
of
the
hearings
have
to
be
forward
into
him
and
if
the
standard
is
not
the
substantial
evidence
test
it
would
be
entirely
possible
that
the
secretary
might
simply
disregard
the
evidence
in
those
hearings.
if
it's
merely
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
and
the
court
looked
only
to
that
evidence
which
supported
this
decision
as
opposed
to
the
entire
record,
and
gave
some
consideration
that
which
detracted
from
it,
the
court
would
--
the
secretary
might
disregard
the
evidence
in
those
hearings
and
the
court
would
not
be
required
to
review
it.
this
we
suggest
this
is
substantial
evidence
test.
i
think
–
excuse
me.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
if
i
recall
the
government's
brief
i
think
that's
a
policy
which
was
adopted
which
has
been
changed
once.
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
changed
again.
we
don't
know
for
instance
whether
it
might
be
waived
in
particular
cases.
there
is
some
effort
along
this
line
as
i
understand
it,
but
i
don't
think
that,
that
is
any
reason
that
this
court
shouldn't
consider
that
issue,
because
i
think
if
as
we
assert
these
findings
are
required
of
judicial
review
in
order
to
make
sure
that
we
have
these
findings
in
every
case
i
think
this
court
should
so
hold.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
it's
something
to
be
considered,
but
i
would
note
that
this
policy
has
been
amended
once
and
there
is
a
i
believe
a
department
of
the
transportation
memorandum
which
is
not
citied
in
the
brief,
so
i
could
provide
you
with
the
citation
which
states
that
no
policy
memorandum,
no
regulations
are
intended
to
create
any
rights
in
private
proprieties
and
i
think
the
intent
of
that
is
to,
to
say
we
may
have
a
policy
such
as
this,
but
if
we
don't
obey
it
in
any
particular
case,
the
citizens
don't
have
any
review.
and
unless
this
court
holds
differently,
lower
courts
are
undoubtedly
going
to
follow
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
that
he
need
to
make
no
formal
findings.
furthermore
i
think,
it's
important,
another
important
issue
in
this
case,
is
a
question
of
whether
he
can
obtain
a
summary
judgment
solely
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
instead
of
submitting
to
the
court
on
his
own
notion
for
summary
judgment
the
record
on
which
he
acted,
instead
he
submits
affidavits
which
characterize
that
record,
and
we
think
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
that's
the
affidavit
of
mr.
edgar
sway
(ph).
thus
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
because
of
the
narrow
constricted
judicial
review,
which
the
sixth
circuit
dictates
in
cases
of
this
nature,
if
that
decision
is
not
reversed,
it
practically
precludes
any
effective
judicial
review
under
the
statutes
on
which
we
rely.
for
that
reason
i
suggest
that
this
a
case
of
extreme
federal
importance,
the
emerging
federal
efforts
to
protect
the
environment
is
worthy
of
consideration
by
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
1966
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
let
me
explain
what
else
is
in
the
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
record
does
say
that
the
decision
was
made
in
1956.
however,
it's
clear
that
with
respect
to
the
alternatives
that
would
be
shown
to
you
on
this
map
that's
brought
in,
the
one
immediately
north
of
the
park
and
south
of
the
park,
those
weren't
even
studied
until
1965
and
the
federal
highway
administrator
was
still
suggesting
them
to
the
city
council
as
alternatives
in
1968.
and
there
is
in
the
record
in
this
case,
a
document,
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
transportation
which
indicates
in
1968
we
had
no
final
decision
on
this
route.
so
although,
some
preliminary
decision
may
have
been
made
in
1956,
and
we
don't
know
the
nature
of
that
preliminary
decision,
it's
clear
that
the
secretary
transportation
was
exploring
alternatives
in
1968,
and
rejected
those
alternatives.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
depended
on
what
project
the
state
wish
to
use
its
own
fund
for.
if
the
state
wishes
to
build
a
highway
in
this
park
with
its
own
funds,
the
interstate
specifications
to
be
linked
with
an
interstate
highway
on
the
west
of
the
park
and
on
east
of
the
park
and
to
provide
the
missing
link
of
interstate
40,
i
think
that
the
federal
government
--
that
the
state
would
be
acting
in
concert
with
acts
as
an
agent
with
federal
government
and
would
be
susceptible
to
equity
powers
of
this
court.
i
think,
it
would
be
a
blatant
effort
to
avoid
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
would
be
in
anticipation
in
a
federal
enterprise.
i
think
that
any
effort
to
circumvent
the
statute
in
that
matter
would
certainly
be
correctable
by
this
court,
or
by
any
federal
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
highly
appropriate
that
the
city
should
buy
more
parkland,
but
we
hardly
think
that
the
way
to
raise
money
for
that
parkland
is
selling
that
which
they
already
have.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
but
i
wish
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
quality
of
the
parks,
the
accessibility
of
the
parks,
the
location
of
the
parks,
all
of
those
are
important.
this
park
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
city
parks
in
the
country
and
i
think
that,
that
should
be
sufficient
to
invoke
the
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
just
a
few
words
in
rebuttal.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
hanover's
discussion
of
the
time
frame
of
the
acquisition
of
right-of-way,
seems
to
be
based
upon
the
premise
that
this
act
was
passed
in
1968
and
it
was
done
before
it
was
passed,
but
that's
incorrect.
the
statute
was
first
passed
in
1966,
and
the
right-of-way
acquisition
began
in
1967.
so
the
acquisition
of
right-of-way
began
after
the
statute
was
passed.
further
in
the
press
release
that
was
put
out
in
1968,
it
contains
of
following
statement,
“much
of
the
right
away
leading
up
the
park
already
has
been
purchased.”
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
provision
was
enacted
in
1966,
section
of
4
(f)
of
department
of
transportation
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes.
your
honor
the
statute
doesn't
says
specificity
he
shall
make
the
finding.
it
says
he
shall
not
approve
the
project
unless
there
is
no
prudent
and
feasible
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
your
honor
and
they
say
now
that
the
route
was
approved
in
the
1968,
but
the
right-of-way
acquisition
began
in
1967
and
by
1968
much
of
it
had
been
acquired.
so
they
acquired
the
right-of-way
before
they
approved
the
project
and
we
shouldn't
be
made
to
bear
the
burden
of
that
rather
precipitous
action.
instead
we
suggest
that
what
they
have
done
by
purchasing
that
right
away
before
making
the
decision
is
to
present
themselves
in
the
court
with
the
(inaudible)
which
shouldn't
be
permitted
and
the
court
should
review
this
decision.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor,
we
are
concerned
about
un-ringing
bell
and
in
our
concern
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
we
can.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
and
this
record
supports
it.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
we
have
own
file
in
this
case
an
affidavit
of
an
expert
transport
plan
who
is
gone
out
and
examined
present
state
of
right-of-way
acquisition
and
examined
alternatives,
has
examine
studies
of
this
and
he
makes
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
your
honor
they
haven't
been
bulldozed
out
to
the
park.
the
houses
have
been
torn
down
but
there
is
no
clearing
up
to
the
park.
the
clearing
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
that
land
would
be
redeveloped,
it
could
be
resold
and
redeveloped
and
what
we
would
suggest
would
be
to
go
back
to
point
in
the
route
where
construction
or
where
clearing
of
right-of-way
is
we
could
use
all
of
the
park
which
has
been
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
in
the
affidavit
which
was
filed
by
our
expert
he
suggested
that
that
these
alternatives
could
be
explored
and
explored
in
a
proper
manner
on
the
basis
of
the
information
already
assembled
within
60
to
90
days
and
this
affidavit
which
is
on
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
assume
that
the
houses,
when
the
lots
would
be
sold
and
they
would
be
rebuilt
according
to
the
purchaser
desires.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
am
not
clear,
your
honor.
this
map
of
course
is
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
am
not
sure
what
these
various
lines
are,
but
it
would
go
back
to
approximately,
i
think
the
houses
have
been
torn
down
all
the
way
up
to
the
park,
but
we
could,
i
suppose
that
park
which
would
be
redeveloped
would
be
in
the
area
of
that
1.7
miles,
something
in
that
order.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
1.7
miles
i
believe,
but
the
reason
those
houses
are
torn
down
is
because
all
of
this
activity
took
place
before
they
made
the
final
decision
on
this
project
and
before
the
route,
and
before
the
statutes
on
which
we
rely
were
actually
brought
into
play,
because
you
had
to
have
a
final
decision
on
the
segment
involving
the
park
before
these
statutes
came
into
play
before
we
had
a
cause
of
action.
we
filed
this
lawsuit
within
a
month
after
that
final
decision.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
this
is
area
right
here
i
think
primarily
was
a
load
of
middle
class
residencies
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
would
say
low
to
middle
class
residential
area.
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
there
are
very
expensive
homes
that
were
torn
down.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record.
cost
of
acquiring
of
the
right-of-way
and
park
is
in
the
record
and
i
think
that's
2.2
million
dollars,
but
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record
what
it
cost
to
acquire
the
right-of-way
outside
of
the
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
state,
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
i
assume
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
to
my
understanding
your
honor.
i
was
led
to
believe
that
based
on
a
representation
of
the
document
of
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
district
of
columbia,
that
the
bulk
of
relevant
documents
in
the
case
were
in
tennessee,
that's
why
the
government
sought
to
change
venue.
i
was
on
afternoon,
two
days
before
preliminary
injunction
motion
allowed
to
examine
a
file
in
preparation
for
that
preliminary
injunction
motion
which
i
understood
did
not
constitute
anywhere
near
the
number
of
relevant
documents
in
this
case.
and
at
no
time
to
my
recollection
was
i
told
that
this
was
the
administrative
record
on
which
the
secretary
acted.
i
think
further
more
the
question
of
what
the
administrative
record
is,
is
a
legal
question,
but
i
was
in
no
time
told
that
this
was
the
record
on
which
he
acted.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
i
might
add
that
the
document
--
the
document
which
we
did
take
from
that
file
and
put
in
the
record
in
this
case,
is
a
document
which
had
not
been
submitted
by
mr.
speight.
that's
the
document
which
shows
that
the
alternative
to
the
north
actually
takes
more
residencies,
displaces
or
adversely
effects
more
people
in
the
route
which
goes
through
the
park.
they
characterize
that
route
is
taking
south-western
university.
as
you
can
see
from
here
it
goes
past
what
looks
to
be
a
grand
front
lawn
of
south-western.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
appropriate
relief
would
be
that
suggested
by
judge
celebrezze
that
this
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
be
remand
treated
as
a
mandamus
action
and
remanded
to
the
secretary
to
have
him
a
formal
statement
on
the
record
as
to
what
decisions
he
made
and
why
which
the
court,
district
court
could
then
review.
that
that's
one
alternative
otherwise
the
court
could
simply
reverse
enter
an
injunction
and
i
assume
if
the
secretary
wanted
to
he
could
come
back
and
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
oh,
i
certainly
would
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
were
back
that
the
summary
judgment
would
be
reversed
and
when
we
were
back
in
the
district
court
we
would
be
entitled
to
whatever
type
of
trial
that
we
were
entitled
in
issue.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
should
be
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
it's
--
it
is
undoubtedly
complicated
somewhat
by
that,
but
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
it's
necessary
to
impose
upon
this
–
the
people
and
make
these
decisions
if
the
requirement
that
they
be
incorporated
in
some
type
of
written
orders
so
that
as
the
administration
change
whatever
was
decided
will
be
recorded
there.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
they
certainly
could
have,
however
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
however,
the
fact
that
they
didn't,
i
think
should
not
be
regarded,
that
the
silence
in
congress
should
not
be
regarded
as
provision
not
to
do
it,
particularly
where
congress
has
made
these
actions
specifically
reviewable
by
the
courts
under
the
administrative
procedure.
i
would
note
that
the
people
who
did
make
the
original
decisions
or
decisions
in
1968
are
available
to
testify
and
they
are
willing
to
testify
and
under
the
decision
below,
we
are
not
permitted
to
ask
them
what
decisions
they
make.
that's
another
reason
we
suggest
a
decision
below
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
section
138
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act.
now,
if
your
honor
would
examine
what
the
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act,
not
as
it
presently
appears,
as
it
appeared
when
enacted
in
1966,
the
operative
provisions
are
verbatim
with
the
provision.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no.
i
mean
that
the
provisions
which
we
were
discussing,
shall
not
approve
unless
there
are
no
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
shall
not
approve
a
project
or
program,
i
believe
is
the
statutory
language.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
under
the
department
of
transportation
act.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
department
of
--
let
me
explain
just
briefly
the
way
these
acts
were
passed.
there
was
at
one
time
when
department
of
transportation
act
was
passed,
section
4
(f)
was
included
and
it
said,
“the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
project
unless
there
are
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives
or
unless
the
design
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm.”
there
was
at
that
time
a
section
138
in
the
federal-aid
highway
act
that
was
slightly
different.
in
1968,
it
was
decided
to
make
those
identical
and
there
was
an
amendment
in
1968,
but
the
requirements
concerning
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives,
and
the
requirements
concerning
all
possible
planning
were
in
the
1966
act,
were
applicable
to
this
case
and
indeed
the
department
of
transportation
considered
them
applicable
to
this
case.
now
mr.
bridwell
testified
before
congress
on
one
occasion
concerning
certain
aspects
of
this
case
and
he
said,
section
4(f)
came
into
play.
so
it
was
the
department's
interpretation
of
the
act
as
well
as
ours.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
this
is
i-40.
it's
a
transcontinental
highway
and
as
i
understand
it
goes
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
even
sure
if
that's
a
question
in
this
particular
case
your
honor,
because
the
--
for
people
traveling
on
an
interstate
through
a
traveling
interstate,
they
don't
have
to
go
on
this
highway.
there
is
under
construction
now
a
circumferential
which
will
go
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
think
it's
located
closer,
but
basically
the
idea
is
the
same
so
that
those
that
are
traveling
through
can
–
would
be
able
to
go
on
a
circumferential
and
avoid
going
downtown.
i
think
that's
that's
the
way
those
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
senator
yarborough
of
texas
did.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
at
that
time,
this
was
one
of
the
first
bills
which
was
passed
to
articulate
a
purpose
and
to
begin
a
program
in
environmental
protection.
that
movement
has
been
building
up
over
the
year
since
1966
and
now
there
is
wide
support
for
this
bill
and
every
other
type
of
bill,
practically
every
other
type
of
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
to
protect
parks,
to
protect
recreation
areas,
to
protect
our
natural
resources.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
in
passing
on
the
secretary's
judgment,
the
district
court
may
determine
whether
he
applied
the
statute
incorrectly
in
not
choosing
other
alternatives.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
oh!
no,
that's
--
i
really
your
honor
--
no
it's
not
up
to
the
district
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
question
will
be
whether
he
complied
with
the
statute?
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
previously
before
your
honors
on
december
7,
at
which
time
the
parties
engaged
in
extensive
oral
argument
on
petitioner's
application
for
stay
to
prevent
the
construction
of
a
large
six-lane
interstate
highway
through
overton
park
in
memphis
tennessee.
after
hearing
argument,
the
court
granted
the
stay,
granted
certiorari,
set
the
case
for
argument
on
the
merits
today.
as
your
honors
will
recall,
this
case
arises
under
a
federal
statute,
generally,
referred
to
as
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act
which
provides
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
shall
not
approve
a
highway
project
which
affects
a
public
park
such
as
overton
park,
unless
there
are
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
routes
or
unless
the
design
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm.
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
argument
on
december
the
7,
there
are
all
alternative
routes
to
that
through
the
park,
there
are
all
alternative
designs
which
would
minimize
harm
to
the
park,
designs
admittedly
possible
in
this
case.
we
have
alleged
supported
that
the
proper
determinations
which
are
required
by
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act,
were
not
made
and
indeed
even
if
they
were
made,
they
were
infirm
or
legally
invalid.
since
this
court
granted
certiorari,
there
have
been
two
important
developments
in
this
case.
immediately
thereafter,
the
solicitor
general
on
behalf
of
the
secretary,
filed
a
motion
to
remand
in
which
he
conceded
that
the
courts
below
had
erred
in
granting
and
affirming
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
which
merely
characterize
documents
on
which
these
determinations,
he
said,
had
been
made.
we
certainly
agree
that
the
summary
judgment
was
wrong,
but
we
have
oppose
an
immediate
remand
because
of
the
other
important
issues
which
we
believe
should
be
decided
in
this
case.
the
second
important
development
which
has
occurred
since
we
were
here
before,
occurred
approximately
10
minutes
ago.
at
that
time,
the
solicitor
general
handed
me
two
pieces
of
paper,
which
purport
to
be
affidavits
which
i
understand
he
is
attempting
to
file
in
this
case
at
this
time,
one
of
which
says
that
as
an
affidavit
of
alan
s.
boyd
and
which
he
says
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
did
make
the
determination
which
we
have
alleged
he
did
not
make
and
which
we
have
offered
to
prove
that
he
did
not
make.
the
second
piece
of
paper
which
he
has
filed
purports
to
be
an
affidavit
of
john
volpe
that
he
made
certain
determinations.
now
i
know
that
no
president
which
permits
a
party
to
filed
in
this
court,
at
this
stage
in
the
proceedings
affidavit.
i
do
recall
that
there
was
a
case
here,
i
believe
in
1968
entitled
bumpers
against
north
carolina,
in
which
the
case,
in
which
this
court,
it
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
validity
of
a
warrantless
search.
and
as
i
recall
that
case
during
the
course
of
the
oral
argument,
the
attorney
for
the
state
said
for
the
first
time
in
the
proceedings
that
in
fact
the
search
in
that
case
had
not
been
without
a
warrant,
that
he
had
found
the
warrant
after
the
decision
below
and
i
believe
he
attempted
to
file
the
warrant
in
this
court.
as
i
recall
the
opinion
in
that
case,
the
court
said,
it's
too
late.
you
make
your
record
in
a
trial
court
and
at
that
point
you
consider
that's
where
these
facts
are
tried
out.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
generally,
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
aspect
that
would
bear
on
this
point.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
perhaps
if
the
court
would
like,
memorandum
on
whether
this
evidence
is
properly
before
the
court
at
this
time,
i
would
be
happy
to
file
a
memorandum,
but
i
think
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
effort
in
which
--
the
manner
in
which
to
present
evidence
in
a
case,
particularly
since
we
were
not
permitted,
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
we
were
barred
by
this
court's
decision
in
morgan
from
taking
a
deposition
which
we
had
specifically
offered,
will
dispute
one
of
these
affidavits.
if
as
we
submit
one
of
the
crucial
issues
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
determinations
under
section
49
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act
have
been
made.
we
think
that
it's
undisputed
that
that
is
a
crucial
issue
in
this
case
then
that
issue
should
be
tired
out
in
the
way
disputed
issues
in
fact
are
traditionally
tried
in
lawsuit.
we
should
put
on
our
evidence
and
they
should
put
theirs
on.
each
side's
evidence
should
be
subject
to
cross
examination.
we
should
not
try
it
up
by
affidavits
filed
in
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
--
i
might
add
that
in
my
review
of
these
documents
at
the
time
before
they
were
filed
indicates
to
me
that
they
do
not
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
department,
the
transportation
order
which
was
as
i
understand
promulgated
on
october
7,
1970,
which
now
requires
formal
findings,
in
cases
under
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act.
so
even
if
the
court
were
consider,
to
consider
this
evidence
the
secretary
has
still
not
complied
with
that
order.
and
i
think
under
this
courts
decision
in
the
thorpe
case,
where
it
states
the
general
rule
that
the
issues
presented
here
must
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
decision.
even
if
you
consider
these
pieces
of
paper
it
would
still
not
be
compliance
with
that
order,
or
with
the
law
and
a
remand
would
be
necessary.
the
second
issue
which
remains
in
this
case,
aside
from
the
question
of
whether
there
was
adequate
compliance
with
section
4
(f)
by
the
secretary's
failure
to
render
any
written
document
at
the
time
the
decision
was
made,
the
second
issue
which
remains
is
whether,
whether
the
court
below
was
proper
in
holding
that
petitioners
were
barred
from
deposing
formal
federal
highway
administrator,
bridwell
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
decisions
under
this
statute
were
made.
and
we
sought
to
depose
formal
federal
highway
administrator,
bridwell
because
the
documents
in
this
case
indicate
that
if
he
wasn't
the
sole
person
who
made
the
determinations
at
least
he
was
intimately
involved
in
any
determination
that
would
have
been
made.
indeed
the
record
never
refers,
at
least,
until
these
documents
submitted
today
there
was
no
reference
in
the
record
to
decision
made
by
former
secretary
boyd.
wherever
his
name
appeared,
it
appeared
jointly
with
federal
highway
administrator
bridwell.
more
over
it
was
mr.
bridwell
who
went
to
congress
to
testify
about
what
occurred
in
this
case.
so
we
noticed
the
deposition
of
mr.
bridwell.
we
have
offered
to
prove
through
his
deposition
that
no
such
determination
was
made.
that
in
fact,
he
merely
delegated
this
to
city
council
of
memphis
and
left
it
up
to
them
to
decide.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
court's
decision
in
morgan
against
united
states
prohibited
any
interrogation
of
the
secretary
as
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
made
these
decisions.
we
believe
that
that
is
erroneous
extension
of
the
morgan
doctrine.
while
morgan
may
prohibit
inquiry
as
to
how
decisions
were
made
it
does
not.
i
believe
this
court's
decisions
in
accardi
case
show
that
it
does
not
prohibit
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
decision
which
is
required
by
law
to
be
made
was
in
fact
made
and
i
think
the
point
is
even
sharpened
more
by
the
fact
that
now
we
have
an
affidavit.
an
affidavit
from
a
man
who
has
not
been
cross
examined,
an
affidavit
which
we
have
not
been
permitted
to
impeach
which
purports
through
what
is
a
disputed
fact.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
would
present
a
much
more
difficult
issue
your
honor,
but
i
think
we
should
be
able
to
interrogate
them
particularly
if
they
are
not
operating
on
the
basis
of
a
contemporaneous
document.
in
other
words,
these
are
not
documents
that
were
written
at
the
time
the
decision
was
made.
these
are,
what
i
characterize
as
litigation
affidavits.
these
are
obviously
prepared
with
the
help
of
a
lawyer,
with
the
scope
of
lawsuit
firmly
in
mind
and
filed
in
the
court
and
i
think
it
would
not
be
an
appropriate
in
circumstances
of
that
nature
to
ask
him,
whether
in
fact
he
made
the
decisions
and
if
so
what
materials
he
had
before
him.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
proper,
and
may
not
be
proper
to
say,
did
you
read
every
page
as
they
tried
to
do
in
morgan
or
did
you
consider
this
factor
on
page
one
and
that
factor
on
page
two.
but
i
think
it
is
fair,
i
think
those
attacking
decisions
must
be
able
to
ascertain
what
decisions
were
made
and
what
the
basis
that
is,
what
the
documents
before
the
person
would
have
been
in
order
that
they
can
seek
a
review
,
in
other
words
they
can
seek
a
review
of
what
he
did
on
the
basis
of
what
he
purportedly
acted
upon.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
would
say
that
in
order
to
cross
examine
in
a
case
such
as
that,
you'd
have
to
make
a
strong
showing
that
there
had
been
some
impropriety.
there
are
cases,
and
i
believe
in
accardi
case
there
was
a
finding
or
in
the
singer
sewing
machine
case
there
were
some
findings
where
these
quasi
judicial
body's
members
i
don't
remember,
people
associated
with
them
were
interrogated.
but
certainly
there
would
be
no
reason
if
we
had
formal
findings
in
this
case,
it
would
take
a
very
strong
showing
in
order
to
interrogate
him
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say,
it
would
even
being
necessary,
if
we
had
the
proper
findings
in
this
case.
but
the
important
fact
is
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
proper
findings
--
of
course,
that
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
based
on
evidence
which
supports
them.
whether
or
not
the
secretary
has
considered
everything,
he
ought
to
have
considered
and
whether
or
not,
what
he
did
consider
supports
what
he
did.
i
think
it's
not,
there
is
no
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct.
it
will
determine,
whether
he
made
a
proper
investigation
and
brought
before
him
the
materials
which
he
ought
to
brought
before
him
for
making
such
determination
and
whether
these
materials
support
his
determination.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
don't
mean
any
formal
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
there
is
in
this
case,
no
specific
administrator
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
we
would
be
limited
to
the
administrative
record.
certainly,
if
we
could
show
that,
that
his
findings
were
not
supported
by
what
is
characterized
as
the
administrative
work
record,
we
would
be
entitled
to
relief,
but
i
think
that
we
should
be
able
to
show,
we
would
also
be
entitled
to
relief
if
he
didn't
prepare
a
proper
record,
but
further
more
if
he
has
considered
matters
which
those
attacking
his
decision
and
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
rebut,
i
think
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
rebut
that
evidence
in
someway
and
if
we
can
cast
some
doubt
on
the
credibility
or
the
substantially
of
these
findings
based
on
evidence
which
we
submitted,
i
think
we
will
be
entitled
to
relief
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
must
be
given
a
right
to
rebut
evidence
which
we
have
not
been
appraised
of
on
which
he
relied
on,
an
evidence
which
we
heretofore
had
not
been
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
question
of
our
standing
is,
i
think
at
least
not
been
opposed
at
this
point.
we
do
have
standing,
i
believe
under
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
we
have
standing,
we
certainly
have
standing
to
present
during
the
course
of
the
administrative
process
at
the
public
caring
and
elsewhere,
we
have
standing
to
present
evidence
to
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
and
there
were
certain
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
they
certainly
were
but
now
the
secretary
offers
another,
if
i
can
give,
your
honor,
one
example,
i
think
it
will
point
out
the
necessity
for
this.
they
say
we
couldn't,
apparently
--
in
document,
they
said
in
their
affidavit,
we
couldn't
like
depressed
route
through
this
park,
because
this
would
require
use
of
a
particularly
type
of
pump
and
this
is
unsafe
in
highway
projects
of
this
nature.
now
if
we
are
not
permitted
to
rebut
that
in
any
way,
we
would
not
be
able
to
show
that
the
department
of
transportation
has
authorized
for
use
in
the
interstate
highway,
the
same
type
of
pump
in
other
areas
and
that
cast
such
strong
doubt
as
to
either
the
investigation
which
he
has
made
to
the
safety
in
this
case,
or
as
to
creditability
of
this
explanation,
that
it's
evidence
i
submit,
should
is
relevant
for
the
consideration
of
the
trial
court.
it
may
send
it
--
it
maybe
relevant
only
to
whether
or
not
he's
made
the
proper
investigation
for
making
his
determination,
but
it's
evidence
of
that
nature.
in
fact,
there
has
been
no
objection
heretofore
on
introducing
such
evidence.
the
secretary
has
never
objected
of
introduction
of
evidence
of
that
nature.
we
have
introduced
affidavits
which
documented
that
the
use
of
siphon
in
department
of
interior
projects,
we
introduced
affidavits
of
the
use
of
this
type
of
pump
that
would
be
required
here,
we
have
introduced
affidavits
as
to
the
type
of
the
use
of
tunnels
in
the
interstate
system.
they
have
not
heretofore
objected
to
that
type
of
evidence.
but
it
would
only
--
i
don't
think
that
this
would
not
be
a
de
novo
advisory
proceeding
in
which
we
tried
out
every
fact.
it
would
only
be
in
case
we
are
able
to
present
some
evidence
which
created
some
dispute
over
whether
what
the
secretary
found
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
we
can
cross
examine
him
a
little
bit.
we
would
not,
i
say,
be
permitted
to
cross
examine
him
unless
we
would
meet
the
strong
burden
in
the
trial
court
that
suggested
some
impropriety
in
what
he
did.
for
instance,
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
would
be
true
in
this
case
or
whatsoever,
but
as
a
hypothetical
example,
if
there
were
some
evidence
to
indicate
fraud
or
bribery,
it
might
be
that
type
of
attack
on
the
findings
i
believe
it
would
be
proper
and
i
think
we
could
cross
examine.
in
the
accardi
case,
there
was
an
allegation
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
acted
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
attorney
general's
list
that
had
been
published
and
there
the
court
held,
it
was
proper
to
cross
examine.
but
only
after
we
have
met
a
very
strong
burden
of
demonstrating
that
there
is
some
impropriety.
i
think
it
would
shift
the
burden
to
us,
it
would
place
a
very
heavy
burden
upon
us
but
in
the
general
case,
in
the
usual
case,
i
would
suggest
that
we
would
not
cross
examine
in
those
circumstances,
but
in
this
particular
case,
where
have
this
affidavit
of
secretary,
former
secretary
boyd,
we
do
have
evidence
which
will
dispute
this.
i
am
not
so
concerned
about
cross
examining
secretary
board
as
i
am
presenting
that
evidence.
and
it's
interesting
the
reason
it
hasn't
been
presented
heretofore
is
because
former
highway
administrator
bridwell
said
he
didn't
think
it
was
proper
when
i
talked
to
him,
to
present
this
by
affidavit.
he
thought
it
was
better
if
he
wouldn't
take
side,
that
we
would
testify
in
court
and
let
both
sides
have
a
shot
at
him.
we
weren't
permitted
to
put
him
on
the
stand
to
have
him
testify.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
i
don't
but
i
am
simply
explaining
why
we
don't
have
an
affidavit
of
the
same
nature
that
they
do
here
today.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well
the
certificate
of
allen
boyd
says,
in
april
of
1968,
he
made
a
decision
that
there
was
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
routing
the
highway
generally
along
in
the
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
on
this
affidavit
but
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well
there
are
very
vague
allegations
in
an
affidavit
that
in
1968,
secretary
boyd
and
former
federal
highway
administrator,
bridwell
reaffirmed
a
previous
decision
and
that's
the
extent
of
the
documentation.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
they
claimed
it
was
made
in
1956,
but
that
other
evidence
in
the
record
which
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
that
shows
that
these
decisions
were
made,
not
that
it
says
these
decisions
were
made.
in
fact
the
record
indicate,
the
affidavit
of
volpe
refers
to
another
determination
in
1969.
the
record
is
equally
unclear
on
that
point.
finally,
the
third
point
which
we
submit
should
be
resolved
by
this
court
before
any
remand
which
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
understand
is
conceded
is
necessary
in
this
case,
would
be
the
appropriate
standard
of
review.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
the
only
standard
of
review
is
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
the
administrative
procedure
act
posses
that
is
the
minimum
constitutional
requirement.
so
the
legislative
history
says
and
the
act
we
believe
requires
a
court
to
go
further
and
even
if
the
finding
is
not
arbitrary
capricious,
it
requires
a
review
of
the
evidence
to
support
it.
either
under
the
substantial
evidence
standard
or
the
unwarranted
by
the
fact
standard,
we
believe
that
the
court
below
was
in
error
in
limiting
its
review
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
respondents
in
this
case
traditionally
start
each
argument
with
the
statement
that
this
highway
will
run
along
a
bus
route
through
the
park,
and
the
implication
being
we'll
have
practically
no
effect
on
this.
this
bus
route
which
is
displayed
here
is
narrow
facility,
some
25
feet
wide,
on
which
buses
run
through
about
once
in
an
hour,
in
fact
it's
so
narrow
that
the
trees
from
the
wooded
part
of
the
park
hang
over
the
bus
route
freely
crossed
by
pedestrians.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
bus
route
is
only
used
for
about
one
bus
an
hour,
no
cars,
no
other
traffic.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
and
trucks
that
interstate
--
for
commercial
and
passenger
vehicles.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
freight,
trucks.
the
statements
which
they
claim
is
unwarranted.
the
statement
would
says
there
won't
be
much
of
a
wooded
area
left
in
the
park,
that's
not
a
statement
we
made.
that's
a
statement
that
an
official
of
department
of
interior
made,
a
department
which
the
secretary
is
statue
found
to
consult
with
on
projects
of
this
nature.
it
is
a
document,
fully
part
of
the
administrative
record.
they
don't
seek
to
dispute
that.
they
within
any
other
evidence
they
simply
say
it
can't
be
right.
we
submit
that
department
of
interior
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
but
i
think
what
the
official
had
in
mind,
not
that
a
major
part
of
the
woodland
would
be
taken.
there
will
be
a
450
foot
right-of-way
through
that
area.
but
what
he
meant
was,
not
only
that
you
take
the
450
feet,
but
you
really
destroy
the
rest
of
the
park
because
immediately
you
don't
have
a
woodland
park,
immediately
adjacent
to
the
highway,
if
you
got
a
six
lane
interstate
highway
going.
you
have
beside
the
sound,
the
general
pollution
associate
with
these
highways,
which
spread
further
than
the
right-of-way.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
450
feet
in
the
wooded
area
of
the
park,
and
i
think
anyone
who
has
ever
stood
anywhere
close
to
an
interstate
highway
of
this
nature
knows
that
the
effects
don't
stops
at
the
age
of
the
pavement
and
i
think
your
honor
that's
what
the
department
of
interior
official
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
there
is
very
i
--
it's
not
clear
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
but
this
was
showed
as
i
think
in
the
case
are
very
narrow.
that's
one
of
the
points
i
made
also
that
they
didn't
take
very
much.
a
second
point
which
they
raise
is
that
the
right-of-way
for
this
route
was
acquired
long
before
the
decision
--
was
acquired
after
the
decisions
were
made.
in
fact,
the
department
of
transportation
authorized
the
acquisitions
for
the
right-of-way
of
this
project
before
they
ever
made
any
effort
to
comply
with
the
statute.
even
if
we
assume,
what
the
solicitor
general
says
is
correct,
and
even
if
we
assume
what
is
stated
in
these
certificates
are
right,
the
department
of
transportation
told
the
state
to
go
ahead
and
acquire
the
land
for
this
project
in
may
1967,
a
month
after
the
statue
was
affected,
but
11
months
before
any
effort
was
made
to
comply
with
it.
and
i
submit
that
right-of-way
acquired
under
that
authorization
is
acquired
illegally
which
should
not
prejudice
the
petitioners'
position.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i'll
be
able
to
show
your
honor,
that
in
my
test,
my
evidence
would
show
that
the
officials
of
the
department
of
transportation
left
this
decision
solely
to
the
city
council
of
memphis.
they
went
down
and
made
an
explanation,
and
they
although
they
pointed
out
alternatives
both
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
of
the
park,
they
never
decided
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
department
of
transportation,
that
these
alternatives,
whether
these
alternatives
were
prudent
and
feasible.
they
attempted
to
delegate
to
the
city
council,
and
once
a
city
council
made
up
its
mind,
they
simply
rubber
stamped
that.
they
approved
the
highway
without
ever
making
their
own
independent
judgment
as
to
whether
they
were
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
that's
what
mr.
bridwell
would
testified
to.
i
think
it's
also
supported
by
the
evidence,
his
testimony
before
the
congress
which
is
in
exhibit
in
this
case,
but
that's
what
secretary
bridwell
would
testify
to.
and
i
think
that
even
in
footnote
25
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
he
concedes
that
the
statute
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
secretary
of
transportation,
to
make
an
independent
determination,
and
we
will
show
that
independent
determination
was
never
made
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
say,
we
have
evidence
which
would
dispute
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
didn't
even
make
a
minimal
determination.
further
with
respect
to
the
design,
we
would
show
that
designs
which
they
reject
as
impossible
are
in
fact
designs
which
are
clearly
possible.
they
are
the
types
of
designs
that
are
used
through
out
the
interstate
highway
system
and
clearly
possible
here.
and
that
there
is
no
basis
--
i
don't
know
on
what
basis
they
can
possibly
say
that
they
were
impossible
in
terms
of
the
statute,
but
we'll
prove
they
certainly
were
possible.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
oh,
no.
i
have
no
ground
of
which
to
question
that.
no
i
simply
say
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
have
the
authenticity
on
these
pieces
of
paper.
i
merely
say
that
i
think
we
would
have
evidence
to
contradict
it.
furthermore
there
was
a
reference
made
to
the
legislative
history.
i
think
that's
a
misnomer.
for
the
legislative
materials
to
which
the
solicitor
general
refers,
are
not
history
at
all.
those
are
materials
that
were
created
or
put
in
the
congressional
record
over
year
after
the
the
statute
was
passed.
this
statute
was
passed
i
believe
by
the
89th
congress
in
1966,
and
all
of
the
materials
to
which
he
refers
are
the
materials
taken
from
the
90th
congress
in
1968,
hardly
we
submit
legislative
history.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
relevant
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
those
statements
were
made
generally
by
people
who
opposed
this
statute
in
the
beginning,
who
tried
to
amend
it
to
weaken
the
statute
and
in
fact
the
secretary
of
transportation
opposed
any
amendment.
so
they
were
in
effect
efforts
to
cut
down
the
force
of
this
statute
on
the
floor
of
the
congress.
we
submit
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face
(inaudible)
interpreting
by
looking
at
the
statute.
finally,
i
would
say
to
your
honors
that
this
case
is
not
only
important
to
my
clients,
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
but
the
people
of
memphis.
this
case
has
great
importance
to
the
people
of
this
nation.
the
importance
of
this
statute
is
one
which
will
drastically
effect
at
least
the
battle
to
preserve
this
nation's
environment
against
projects
such
as
that
involved
here.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
today
on
an
application
for
stay,
pending
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
we
seek
an
application
to
stay
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
secretary
of
transportation
and
the
commissioner
and
the
department
of
highways
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
from
authorizing
the
beginning
of
construction
of
a
six-lane
interstate
highway
which
will
pass
through
overton
park,
a
large
public
park
located
in
memphis,
tennessee.
if
this
stay
is
not
granted,
the
respondents
will
authorize
construction,
and
that
construction
will
proceed
before
this
court
has
an
opportunity
to
act
on
a
petition
for
certiorari.
that
construction
will
inflict
grave
and
irreparable
damage
to
the
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
we
have
until
the
january
28,
i
believe,
towards
the
end
of
january.
however,
as
we
suggested
in
the
brief
which
we've
filed,
we
are
willing
to
have
the
court
act
upon
these
papers
as
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
can
meet
the
formal
requirements
by
filing
the
petition
with
the
court.
we
are
ready
to
proceed
immediately.
we
have
not
filed
a
petition
thus
far
because
there
is
the
threat,
if
the
stay
is
not
granted
proportions
of
the
case
maybe
mooting.
we're
willing
to
proceed
immediately
with
the
filing
of
the
petition.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
if
the
respondents
are
permitted
to
proceed
with
this
construction,
they
may
likely
moot
this
case.
if
they
do,
they
would
have
been
successful
without
ever
having
filed
an
answer
to
the
petitioner's
complaint,
without
putting
one
witness
on
the
witness
stand,
without
having
one
of
their
officials
subject
to
examination
by
deposition,
but
instead
on
a
basis,
out
of
court,
the
litigation
affidavits,
filed
in
support
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that's
the
record
in
this
case.
so,
the
decision
below
is
based
solely
on
affidavits.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
which
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
this
case
arises
under
a
statute
passed
in
1966
which
articulates
a
national
policy
for
preserving
park
lands,
recreation
areas,
historic
sites,
waterfowl
and
wildlife
refuges.
that
statute
provides
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
shall
not
approve
any
project
which
affects
a
parkland
or
recreation
area,
unless
there
are
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives,
or
unless
the
design
of
the
project
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm.
the
park
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
large
342
acre
public
park
located
in
memphis,
tennessee.
it
has
within
it
approximately
a
170-acres
of
woodland
forest.
as
of
1965,
it's
constituted
one-half,
of
the
city
of
memphis;
memphis's
woodland
forest.
if
this
highway
goes
through
that
part
of
the
park,
according
to
department
of
interior
officials
who
proposed
this
project,
there
will
be
very
little
left
of
the
woodland
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
we're
willing,
yes,
we
are
willing
to
treat
this
argument
as
an
argument
on
the
merits
as
well.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
we
are
--
we
are
--
if
the
the
court
would
like
to
consider
this
as
an
argument
on
the
merit,
we're
willing
to
have
it
treated
that.
this
highway
project
involves
a
construction
of
the
six-lane
interstate
highway
with
the
right
of
way
between
250
feet
and
450
feet
wide.
as
it
proceeds
through
the
wooded
area
of
the
park,
if
it's
constructed,
as
it's
presently
planned,
it
will
take
a
swath
of
450
feet
out
of
the
wooded
section,
and
pass
through
a
small
picturesque
lake
and
a
pond.
it
will
pass
immediately
adjacent
to
the
zoo,
and
it
will
be
a
literal
barrier
to
either
side
of
the
park.
it'll
literally
cut
this
park
in
two.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
i
think
that's
an
undisputed
fact
that
on
this
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
figures
in
this
record
are
that
to
tunnel
it
and
they
suggest
two
types
of
tunnels,
it
would
cost,
they
estimate,
they
don't
have
any
calculations,
they
are
estimates,
would
cost
up
to
$40
million.
there
is
however,
a
suggestion
that
was
made
by
the
department
of
interior
officials
for
fully
depressed
ground
which
would
not
be
a
tunnel,
and
there
are
no
cost
figures
on
that
design.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
think
there
is
an
estimate
of
$40
million
but
that
involves
first
fully
depressing
and
then
totally
covering
it.
what
is
known
as
i
understand
is
a
cut-and-covered
tunnel.
but,
if
you
simply
depressed
it
all
the
way
through
the
park,
that
would
minimize
harm
to
the
park,
but
there
are
no
cost
figures
on
that.
and
my
point,
incidentally
they
have
raised
an
objection
that
this
would
create
certain
drainage
problems
within
--
there's
a
small
creek
which
runs
through
the
park,
and
they
maintain
that
this
--
it
can't
go
pass
that
creek
where
the
depressed
ground.
there
are
affidavits
on
file,
in
this
case
which
suggest
that
difficulty
could
be
overcome
by
standard
engineering
techniques
which
are
use
in
the
interstate
system,
just
today,
have
been
in
use
in
the
interstate
system
for
sometime,
if
they
refused
to
use
them
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
acreage
of
the
park
is
your
honor
is
342
acres.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
26
centrally
located
acres,
would
be
taken.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
problem
with
that
is,
is
that
the
stream
is
only
slightly
west
of
the
center
of
the
park
and
they
actually
go
above
grade
at
that
point.
so,
although
they
depress
it
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
park,
as
it
rises
to
that
portion
of
above
grade
for
a
substantial
part
of
it's
nearly
at
grade
and
you
have
to
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
this
is
part
of
a
cross
continental
east-west
interstate.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
park
lies
practically
in
the
middle
of
the
city,
if
you
look
at
the
map
of
memphis.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
this
park
is
practically
in
the
middle
of
the
city.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
zoo
–
and
this
highway
will
run
adjacent
to
the
southern
boundary
of
the
zoo.
this
highway
was
approved
in
november
1969.
this
action
was
filed
immediately
thereafter.
prior
to
the
time
this
highway
was
approved
there
was
a
study
of
several
alternative
routes,
one
which
would
swing
immediately
to
the
north
of
the
park,
and
one
which
would
swing
immediately
to
the
south
of
the
park.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
mr.
reynolds
will
bring
a
map
in
the
court
during
his
argument.
he'll
show
you
the
bands
on
the
map,
where
these
alternatives
would
go.
now,
in
the
department
of
transportation,
in
the
secretary's
papers
which
are
on
file,
he's
maintained
that
those
alternatives
were
rejected
because
of
large
displacement
of
persons
and
businesses.
in
his
affidavit,
he
gives
you
some
statistics,
as
to
the
number
of
people
who'd
be
displaced
by
the
route
which
goes
to
north
and
that
which
goes
to
the
south.
what
he
doesn't
give
you
in
the
affidavit
is
the
number
of
people
who'd
be
adversely
affected
not
only
in
the
use
of
the
park
but
in
their
home's
and
businesses
by
the
route
which
uses
the
park.
and
when
you
search
the
record
further
and
find
those
statistics,
they
demonstrate
that
the
alternative
to
the
north
of
the
park
which
he
rejected
actually
either
displaces
more
people
from
their
homes
or
adversely
affects
people
in
their
businesses
or
schools.
so,
the
test
which
he
asserts,
he's
applied
in
this
case,
was
mis-applied,
if
the
test
is
the
number
of
people
who'd
be
adversely
affected,
or
the
number
of
people
who
will
be
displaced
from
their
homes.
the
route
to
the
north
according
to
their
own
calculation
will
either
displace
or
adversely
affect
2386
people
and
route
through
the
park
according
to
their
own
figures,
will
adversely
affect
to
displace
2607
people,
actually
more
people
than
the
route
to
the
north.
and
this
is
the
case,
even
though
in
their
calculation
they've
made
no
allowance
for
the
people,
they've
not
counted
as
adversely
affected
people
who
use
the
park.
for
instance,
over
a
million
people
a
year
use
this
zoo,
and
they
haven't
calculated
the
effect
on
those
people.
further
more
this
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
some
of
them
may
stop
using
the
park,
some
of
them
may
not
but
one
of
the
problems
in
trying
to
use
mathematical
formulas
in
a
dispute
of
this
kind
is
that
it's
difficult
to
quantify
the
values
of
a
parkland,
and
that's
what
the
one
of
the
reasons
this
statute
was
passed.
decisions
have
been
made
on
locating
kind
of
ways
on
the
basis
of
cost
and
residences
dislocated,
and
where
you
have
decisions
to
made
that
way,
it
was
the
values
of
the
parkland,
the
aesthetic
values,
the
recreational
values
were
often
overlooked
and
that
was
one
of
the
motivating
forces
for
passage
of
this
act.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
it's
hard,
the
record
--
the
record
shows
that
that
construction
began
in
1967.
they
authorized
to
the
acquisition
the
right-of-way.
they
began
to
acquire
it
also
by
parcel.
by
1968
the
record
shows
that
much
of
it
had
been
acquired.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
your
honor
at
that
time
the
secretary
of
transportation,
in
a
letter
to
the
president
of
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
stated
that
the
federal
highway
administrator
had
told
the
memphis
city
council
in
the
april
of
1968
that
the
department
of
transportation
has
no
final
decision
from
the
location
of
this
highway.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
of
this
case.
the
final
decision
which
made
in
1969,
november
of
1969,
a
previous
decision
that
whether
that
was
a
type
of
decision
that
couldn't
have
been
changed,
is
simply
is
not
clear
from
this
record.
at
that
time
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
it
certainly
would
have,
that's
exactly
what
we
saw,
declaratory
injunction
--
the
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction.
i
understand
it
your
honor,
it
is
trouble
by
the
point
of
granting
an
injunction
against
this
highway
where
there
has
been
clearing
of
this
right-of-way
up
to
the
park,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
sequence
of
a
events
here.
they
began
clearing
that
right
away
fully
two
years
before
any
final
decision
was
made,
and
much
of
it
was
acquired
at
the
time
the
department
of
transportation
was
saying
we
have
no
final
decision
on
this
matter.
that
if
the
secretary
is
to
be
allowed
thwart
any
review
of
his
decisions
by
this
piecemeal
acquisition
of
right-of-way
of
right
up
to
the
park,
then
the
administration
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
statute,
is
whittled
away.
because
every
time
he
has
a
controversy
of
project,
it
will
be
possible
to
box
himself
in,
or
box
according
to
present
you
with
a
(inaudible),
simply
by
acquiring
the
right-of-way
right
to
the
park,
before
he
ever
approves
the
park
which
involves
the
park.
and
i
would
point
that
it's
only
once
he
approves
that
segment
that
citizens
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute,
under
which
this
action
was
brought.
and
where
there
has
to
be
a
final
agency
action
involving
a
park
before
we
can
bring
this
suit
and
obtain
the
review.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
and
therefore
our
cause
of
action
didn't
accrue
until
november
1969
and
we
are
then
met
with
the
defense
well
we
have
acquire
this
right-of-way
by
--
before
approving
the
section
which
involves
the
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
now
the
first
issue
we
have
maintained
throughout
that
it
is
a
disputed
issue
of
fact,
but
we
have
framed
it,
in
presenting
at
to
this
court,
we
have
framed
it
a
little
differently.
it's
undisputed
that
at
the
time
we
made
these
decisions
there
was
no
contemporaneous
documentation.
he
never
made
a
record
of
that
and
we
maintain
that
even
if
he
made
a
minimal
finding
simply
decided
in
his
own
mind,
that
that's
inadequate
here.
we
also
maintain
that
he
never
made
such
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
think
at
first
point,
i
think,
it
would
be
mooted.
we
would
then
proceed
to
whether
or
not
the
finding,
the
determination
was
infirm.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does
your
honor.
and
let
me
point
out
that,
there
is
one
contemporaneous
document,
which
he
produced
the
your
honor,
and
that's
a
press
release.
we
litigated
this
case
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
and
he
hasn't
done
so,
not
in
the
explicit
terms
which
i
think
this
court
should
demand
in
order
to
review
what
he
did,
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
one
point
involving
the
press
release.
he
seems
to
take
the
position
that
he
felt
the
route
had
been
determined,
and
as
whether
he
made
any
decisions
as
to
alternative
routes,
i
think
is
open
to
questions.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
his
decision,
that
is
--
that
is
an
additional
point.
the
second
point
which
could
possibly
also
be
mooted
if
he
gave
a
satisfactory
written
determination,
although
i
wouldn't
concede
it
would
be
mooted,
is
that
the
court
below
held
even
though
the
secretary
made
no
documentation
of
his
finding
that
this
court's
decision
in
morgan,
united
states
against
morgan
prohibit
any
inquiry
of
the
secretary
as
to
whether
he
did
make
the
finding.
and
the
difficultly
which
is
presented
to
anyone
seeking
review
under
the
statute,
seeking
enforcement
of
the
statute
under
the
holdings
below,
is
that
the
first
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
record
the
fact
that
he
made
the
determination
required
by
statute,
and
those
seeking
review
aren't
entitled
to
ask
him
whether
he
made
it.
the
court
below
simply
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
how
those
who
seek
review
or
to
have
it
be
able
to
determine
whether
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
affidavit
has
been
construed
that
way.
it
is
much
less
than
clear
from
that
affidavit
that
he
made
these
decisions,
and
we
have
contended
throughout
that
there
is
a
dispute
on
that
issue.
the
affidavit
is
set
out
partly
in
the
briefs,
and
it's
the
record,
i
won't
go
through
it
word
by
word.
rather
than
saying
the
secretary
made
a
decision,
there
being
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives
which
he
could
have
said,
had
he
made
the
determination,
the
affidavit
is
too
much
is
very,
very
vague.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
we
think
that
proper
standard
in
this
case
is
that
suggested
by
judge
celebrezze
below,
whether
it
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
substantial
evidence
test
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
required
where
there
has
been
a
hearing
required
by
statute
and
there
are
hearings
in
this
case
which
are
required
by
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
by
him,
that's
correct,
but
there
are
statute
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
he
doesn't,
no
but
the
transcripts
of
the
hearings
have
to
be
forward
into
him
and
if
the
standard
is
not
the
substantial
evidence
test
it
would
be
entirely
possible
that
the
secretary
might
simply
disregard
the
evidence
in
those
hearings.
if
it's
merely
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
and
the
court
looked
only
to
that
evidence
which
supported
this
decision
as
opposed
to
the
entire
record,
and
gave
some
consideration
that
which
detracted
from
it,
the
court
would
--
the
secretary
might
disregard
the
evidence
in
those
hearings
and
the
court
would
not
be
required
to
review
it.
this
we
suggest
this
is
substantial
evidence
test.
i
think
–
excuse
me.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
if
i
recall
the
government's
brief
i
think
that's
a
policy
which
was
adopted
which
has
been
changed
once.
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
changed
again.
we
don't
know
for
instance
whether
it
might
be
waived
in
particular
cases.
there
is
some
effort
along
this
line
as
i
understand
it,
but
i
don't
think
that,
that
is
any
reason
that
this
court
shouldn't
consider
that
issue,
because
i
think
if
as
we
assert
these
findings
are
required
of
judicial
review
in
order
to
make
sure
that
we
have
these
findings
in
every
case
i
think
this
court
should
so
hold.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
it's
something
to
be
considered,
but
i
would
note
that
this
policy
has
been
amended
once
and
there
is
a
i
believe
a
department
of
the
transportation
memorandum
which
is
not
citied
in
the
brief,
so
i
could
provide
you
with
the
citation
which
states
that
no
policy
memorandum,
no
regulations
are
intended
to
create
any
rights
in
private
proprieties
and
i
think
the
intent
of
that
is
to,
to
say
we
may
have
a
policy
such
as
this,
but
if
we
don't
obey
it
in
any
particular
case,
the
citizens
don't
have
any
review.
and
unless
this
court
holds
differently,
lower
courts
are
undoubtedly
going
to
follow
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
that
he
need
to
make
no
formal
findings.
furthermore
i
think,
it's
important,
another
important
issue
in
this
case,
is
a
question
of
whether
he
can
obtain
a
summary
judgment
solely
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
instead
of
submitting
to
the
court
on
his
own
notion
for
summary
judgment
the
record
on
which
he
acted,
instead
he
submits
affidavits
which
characterize
that
record,
and
we
think
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
that's
the
affidavit
of
mr.
edgar
sway
(ph).
thus
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
because
of
the
narrow
constricted
judicial
review,
which
the
sixth
circuit
dictates
in
cases
of
this
nature,
if
that
decision
is
not
reversed,
it
practically
precludes
any
effective
judicial
review
under
the
statutes
on
which
we
rely.
for
that
reason
i
suggest
that
this
a
case
of
extreme
federal
importance,
the
emerging
federal
efforts
to
protect
the
environment
is
worthy
of
consideration
by
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
1966
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
let
me
explain
what
else
is
in
the
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
record
does
say
that
the
decision
was
made
in
1956.
however,
it's
clear
that
with
respect
to
the
alternatives
that
would
be
shown
to
you
on
this
map
that's
brought
in,
the
one
immediately
north
of
the
park
and
south
of
the
park,
those
weren't
even
studied
until
1965
and
the
federal
highway
administrator
was
still
suggesting
them
to
the
city
council
as
alternatives
in
1968.
and
there
is
in
the
record
in
this
case,
a
document,
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
transportation
which
indicates
in
1968
we
had
no
final
decision
on
this
route.
so
although,
some
preliminary
decision
may
have
been
made
in
1956,
and
we
don't
know
the
nature
of
that
preliminary
decision,
it's
clear
that
the
secretary
transportation
was
exploring
alternatives
in
1968,
and
rejected
those
alternatives.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
depended
on
what
project
the
state
wish
to
use
its
own
fund
for.
if
the
state
wishes
to
build
a
highway
in
this
park
with
its
own
funds,
the
interstate
specifications
to
be
linked
with
an
interstate
highway
on
the
west
of
the
park
and
on
east
of
the
park
and
to
provide
the
missing
link
of
interstate
40,
i
think
that
the
federal
government
--
that
the
state
would
be
acting
in
concert
with
acts
as
an
agent
with
federal
government
and
would
be
susceptible
to
equity
powers
of
this
court.
i
think,
it
would
be
a
blatant
effort
to
avoid
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
would
be
in
anticipation
in
a
federal
enterprise.
i
think
that
any
effort
to
circumvent
the
statute
in
that
matter
would
certainly
be
correctable
by
this
court,
or
by
any
federal
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
highly
appropriate
that
the
city
should
buy
more
parkland,
but
we
hardly
think
that
the
way
to
raise
money
for
that
parkland
is
selling
that
which
they
already
have.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
but
i
wish
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
quality
of
the
parks,
the
accessibility
of
the
parks,
the
location
of
the
parks,
all
of
those
are
important.
this
park
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
city
parks
in
the
country
and
i
think
that,
that
should
be
sufficient
to
invoke
the
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
just
a
few
words
in
rebuttal.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
hanover's
discussion
of
the
time
frame
of
the
acquisition
of
right-of-way,
seems
to
be
based
upon
the
premise
that
this
act
was
passed
in
1968
and
it
was
done
before
it
was
passed,
but
that's
incorrect.
the
statute
was
first
passed
in
1966,
and
the
right-of-way
acquisition
began
in
1967.
so
the
acquisition
of
right-of-way
began
after
the
statute
was
passed.
further
in
the
press
release
that
was
put
out
in
1968,
it
contains
of
following
statement,
“much
of
the
right
away
leading
up
the
park
already
has
been
purchased.”
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
provision
was
enacted
in
1966,
section
of
4
(f)
of
department
of
transportation
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes.
your
honor
the
statute
doesn't
says
specificity
he
shall
make
the
finding.
it
says
he
shall
not
approve
the
project
unless
there
is
no
prudent
and
feasible
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
your
honor
and
they
say
now
that
the
route
was
approved
in
the
1968,
but
the
right-of-way
acquisition
began
in
1967
and
by
1968
much
of
it
had
been
acquired.
so
they
acquired
the
right-of-way
before
they
approved
the
project
and
we
shouldn't
be
made
to
bear
the
burden
of
that
rather
precipitous
action.
instead
we
suggest
that
what
they
have
done
by
purchasing
that
right
away
before
making
the
decision
is
to
present
themselves
in
the
court
with
the
(inaudible)
which
shouldn't
be
permitted
and
the
court
should
review
this
decision.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor,
we
are
concerned
about
un-ringing
bell
and
in
our
concern
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
we
can.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
and
this
record
supports
it.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
we
have
own
file
in
this
case
an
affidavit
of
an
expert
transport
plan
who
is
gone
out
and
examined
present
state
of
right-of-way
acquisition
and
examined
alternatives,
has
examine
studies
of
this
and
he
makes
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
your
honor
they
haven't
been
bulldozed
out
to
the
park.
the
houses
have
been
torn
down
but
there
is
no
clearing
up
to
the
park.
the
clearing
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
that
land
would
be
redeveloped,
it
could
be
resold
and
redeveloped
and
what
we
would
suggest
would
be
to
go
back
to
point
in
the
route
where
construction
or
where
clearing
of
right-of-way
is
we
could
use
all
of
the
park
which
has
been
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
in
the
affidavit
which
was
filed
by
our
expert
he
suggested
that
that
these
alternatives
could
be
explored
and
explored
in
a
proper
manner
on
the
basis
of
the
information
already
assembled
within
60
to
90
days
and
this
affidavit
which
is
on
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
assume
that
the
houses,
when
the
lots
would
be
sold
and
they
would
be
rebuilt
according
to
the
purchaser
desires.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
am
not
clear,
your
honor.
this
map
of
course
is
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
am
not
sure
what
these
various
lines
are,
but
it
would
go
back
to
approximately,
i
think
the
houses
have
been
torn
down
all
the
way
up
to
the
park,
but
we
could,
i
suppose
that
park
which
would
be
redeveloped
would
be
in
the
area
of
that
1.7
miles,
something
in
that
order.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
1.7
miles
i
believe,
but
the
reason
those
houses
are
torn
down
is
because
all
of
this
activity
took
place
before
they
made
the
final
decision
on
this
project
and
before
the
route,
and
before
the
statutes
on
which
we
rely
were
actually
brought
into
play,
because
you
had
to
have
a
final
decision
on
the
segment
involving
the
park
before
these
statutes
came
into
play
before
we
had
a
cause
of
action.
we
filed
this
lawsuit
within
a
month
after
that
final
decision.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
this
is
area
right
here
i
think
primarily
was
a
load
of
middle
class
residencies
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
would
say
low
to
middle
class
residential
area.
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
there
are
very
expensive
homes
that
were
torn
down.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record.
cost
of
acquiring
of
the
right-of-way
and
park
is
in
the
record
and
i
think
that's
2.2
million
dollars,
but
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record
what
it
cost
to
acquire
the
right-of-way
outside
of
the
park.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
state,
and
i
don't
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
i
assume
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
to
my
understanding
your
honor.
i
was
led
to
believe
that
based
on
a
representation
of
the
document
of
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
district
of
columbia,
that
the
bulk
of
relevant
documents
in
the
case
were
in
tennessee,
that's
why
the
government
sought
to
change
venue.
i
was
on
afternoon,
two
days
before
preliminary
injunction
motion
allowed
to
examine
a
file
in
preparation
for
that
preliminary
injunction
motion
which
i
understood
did
not
constitute
anywhere
near
the
number
of
relevant
documents
in
this
case.
and
at
no
time
to
my
recollection
was
i
told
that
this
was
the
administrative
record
on
which
the
secretary
acted.
i
think
further
more
the
question
of
what
the
administrative
record
is,
is
a
legal
question,
but
i
was
in
no
time
told
that
this
was
the
record
on
which
he
acted.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
i
might
add
that
the
document
--
the
document
which
we
did
take
from
that
file
and
put
in
the
record
in
this
case,
is
a
document
which
had
not
been
submitted
by
mr.
speight.
that's
the
document
which
shows
that
the
alternative
to
the
north
actually
takes
more
residencies,
displaces
or
adversely
effects
more
people
in
the
route
which
goes
through
the
park.
they
characterize
that
route
is
taking
south-western
university.
as
you
can
see
from
here
it
goes
past
what
looks
to
be
a
grand
front
lawn
of
south-western.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
appropriate
relief
would
be
that
suggested
by
judge
celebrezze
that
this
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
be
remand
treated
as
a
mandamus
action
and
remanded
to
the
secretary
to
have
him
a
formal
statement
on
the
record
as
to
what
decisions
he
made
and
why
which
the
court,
district
court
could
then
review.
that
that's
one
alternative
otherwise
the
court
could
simply
reverse
enter
an
injunction
and
i
assume
if
the
secretary
wanted
to
he
could
come
back
and
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
oh,
i
certainly
would
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
were
back
that
the
summary
judgment
would
be
reversed
and
when
we
were
back
in
the
district
court
we
would
be
entitled
to
whatever
type
of
trial
that
we
were
entitled
in
issue.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
should
be
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
your
honor
it's
--
it
is
undoubtedly
complicated
somewhat
by
that,
but
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
it's
necessary
to
impose
upon
this
–
the
people
and
make
these
decisions
if
the
requirement
that
they
be
incorporated
in
some
type
of
written
orders
so
that
as
the
administration
change
whatever
was
decided
will
be
recorded
there.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
they
certainly
could
have,
however
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
however,
the
fact
that
they
didn't,
i
think
should
not
be
regarded,
that
the
silence
in
congress
should
not
be
regarded
as
provision
not
to
do
it,
particularly
where
congress
has
made
these
actions
specifically
reviewable
by
the
courts
under
the
administrative
procedure.
i
would
note
that
the
people
who
did
make
the
original
decisions
or
decisions
in
1968
are
available
to
testify
and
they
are
willing
to
testify
and
under
the
decision
below,
we
are
not
permitted
to
ask
them
what
decisions
they
make.
that's
another
reason
we
suggest
a
decision
below
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
section
138
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act.
now,
if
your
honor
would
examine
what
the
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act,
not
as
it
presently
appears,
as
it
appeared
when
enacted
in
1966,
the
operative
provisions
are
verbatim
with
the
provision.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no.
i
mean
that
the
provisions
which
we
were
discussing,
shall
not
approve
unless
there
are
no
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
shall
not
approve
a
project
or
program,
i
believe
is
the
statutory
language.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
under
the
department
of
transportation
act.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
department
of
--
let
me
explain
just
briefly
the
way
these
acts
were
passed.
there
was
at
one
time
when
department
of
transportation
act
was
passed,
section
4
(f)
was
included
and
it
said,
“the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
project
unless
there
are
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives
or
unless
the
design
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm.”
there
was
at
that
time
a
section
138
in
the
federal-aid
highway
act
that
was
slightly
different.
in
1968,
it
was
decided
to
make
those
identical
and
there
was
an
amendment
in
1968,
but
the
requirements
concerning
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives,
and
the
requirements
concerning
all
possible
planning
were
in
the
1966
act,
were
applicable
to
this
case
and
indeed
the
department
of
transportation
considered
them
applicable
to
this
case.
now
mr.
bridwell
testified
before
congress
on
one
occasion
concerning
certain
aspects
of
this
case
and
he
said,
section
4(f)
came
into
play.
so
it
was
the
department's
interpretation
of
the
act
as
well
as
ours.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
this
is
i-40.
it's
a
transcontinental
highway
and
as
i
understand
it
goes
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
even
sure
if
that's
a
question
in
this
particular
case
your
honor,
because
the
--
for
people
traveling
on
an
interstate
through
a
traveling
interstate,
they
don't
have
to
go
on
this
highway.
there
is
under
construction
now
a
circumferential
which
will
go
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
think
it's
located
closer,
but
basically
the
idea
is
the
same
so
that
those
that
are
traveling
through
can
–
would
be
able
to
go
on
a
circumferential
and
avoid
going
downtown.
i
think
that's
that's
the
way
those
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
senator
yarborough
of
texas
did.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
at
that
time,
this
was
one
of
the
first
bills
which
was
passed
to
articulate
a
purpose
and
to
begin
a
program
in
environmental
protection.
that
movement
has
been
building
up
over
the
year
since
1966
and
now
there
is
wide
support
for
this
bill
and
every
other
type
of
bill,
practically
every
other
type
of
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
to
protect
parks,
to
protect
recreation
areas,
to
protect
our
natural
resources.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
in
passing
on
the
secretary's
judgment,
the
district
court
may
determine
whether
he
applied
the
statute
incorrectly
in
not
choosing
other
alternatives.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
oh!
no,
that's
--
i
really
your
honor
--
no
it's
not
up
to
the
district
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
question
will
be
whether
he
complied
with
the
statute?
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
previously
before
your
honors
on
december
7,
at
which
time
the
parties
engaged
in
extensive
oral
argument
on
petitioner's
application
for
stay
to
prevent
the
construction
of
a
large
six-lane
interstate
highway
through
overton
park
in
memphis
tennessee.
after
hearing
argument,
the
court
granted
the
stay,
granted
certiorari,
set
the
case
for
argument
on
the
merits
today.
as
your
honors
will
recall,
this
case
arises
under
a
federal
statute,
generally,
referred
to
as
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act
which
provides
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
shall
not
approve
a
highway
project
which
affects
a
public
park
such
as
overton
park,
unless
there
are
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
routes
or
unless
the
design
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm.
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
argument
on
december
the
7,
there
are
all
alternative
routes
to
that
through
the
park,
there
are
all
alternative
designs
which
would
minimize
harm
to
the
park,
designs
admittedly
possible
in
this
case.
we
have
alleged
supported
that
the
proper
determinations
which
are
required
by
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act,
were
not
made
and
indeed
even
if
they
were
made,
they
were
infirm
or
legally
invalid.
since
this
court
granted
certiorari,
there
have
been
two
important
developments
in
this
case.
immediately
thereafter,
the
solicitor
general
on
behalf
of
the
secretary,
filed
a
motion
to
remand
in
which
he
conceded
that
the
courts
below
had
erred
in
granting
and
affirming
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
which
merely
characterize
documents
on
which
these
determinations,
he
said,
had
been
made.
we
certainly
agree
that
the
summary
judgment
was
wrong,
but
we
have
oppose
an
immediate
remand
because
of
the
other
important
issues
which
we
believe
should
be
decided
in
this
case.
the
second
important
development
which
has
occurred
since
we
were
here
before,
occurred
approximately
10
minutes
ago.
at
that
time,
the
solicitor
general
handed
me
two
pieces
of
paper,
which
purport
to
be
affidavits
which
i
understand
he
is
attempting
to
file
in
this
case
at
this
time,
one
of
which
says
that
as
an
affidavit
of
alan
s.
boyd
and
which
he
says
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
did
make
the
determination
which
we
have
alleged
he
did
not
make
and
which
we
have
offered
to
prove
that
he
did
not
make.
the
second
piece
of
paper
which
he
has
filed
purports
to
be
an
affidavit
of
john
volpe
that
he
made
certain
determinations.
now
i
know
that
no
president
which
permits
a
party
to
filed
in
this
court,
at
this
stage
in
the
proceedings
affidavit.
i
do
recall
that
there
was
a
case
here,
i
believe
in
1968
entitled
bumpers
against
north
carolina,
in
which
the
case,
in
which
this
court,
it
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
validity
of
a
warrantless
search.
and
as
i
recall
that
case
during
the
course
of
the
oral
argument,
the
attorney
for
the
state
said
for
the
first
time
in
the
proceedings
that
in
fact
the
search
in
that
case
had
not
been
without
a
warrant,
that
he
had
found
the
warrant
after
the
decision
below
and
i
believe
he
attempted
to
file
the
warrant
in
this
court.
as
i
recall
the
opinion
in
that
case,
the
court
said,
it's
too
late.
you
make
your
record
in
a
trial
court
and
at
that
point
you
consider
that's
where
these
facts
are
tried
out.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
generally,
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
aspect
that
would
bear
on
this
point.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
perhaps
if
the
court
would
like,
memorandum
on
whether
this
evidence
is
properly
before
the
court
at
this
time,
i
would
be
happy
to
file
a
memorandum,
but
i
think
that
this
is
an
extraordinary
effort
in
which
--
the
manner
in
which
to
present
evidence
in
a
case,
particularly
since
we
were
not
permitted,
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
we
were
barred
by
this
court's
decision
in
morgan
from
taking
a
deposition
which
we
had
specifically
offered,
will
dispute
one
of
these
affidavits.
if
as
we
submit
one
of
the
crucial
issues
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
determinations
under
section
49
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act
have
been
made.
we
think
that
it's
undisputed
that
that
is
a
crucial
issue
in
this
case
then
that
issue
should
be
tired
out
in
the
way
disputed
issues
in
fact
are
traditionally
tried
in
lawsuit.
we
should
put
on
our
evidence
and
they
should
put
theirs
on.
each
side's
evidence
should
be
subject
to
cross
examination.
we
should
not
try
it
up
by
affidavits
filed
in
this
court.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
--
i
might
add
that
in
my
review
of
these
documents
at
the
time
before
they
were
filed
indicates
to
me
that
they
do
not
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
department,
the
transportation
order
which
was
as
i
understand
promulgated
on
october
7,
1970,
which
now
requires
formal
findings,
in
cases
under
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act.
so
even
if
the
court
were
consider,
to
consider
this
evidence
the
secretary
has
still
not
complied
with
that
order.
and
i
think
under
this
courts
decision
in
the
thorpe
case,
where
it
states
the
general
rule
that
the
issues
presented
here
must
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
decision.
even
if
you
consider
these
pieces
of
paper
it
would
still
not
be
compliance
with
that
order,
or
with
the
law
and
a
remand
would
be
necessary.
the
second
issue
which
remains
in
this
case,
aside
from
the
question
of
whether
there
was
adequate
compliance
with
section
4
(f)
by
the
secretary's
failure
to
render
any
written
document
at
the
time
the
decision
was
made,
the
second
issue
which
remains
is
whether,
whether
the
court
below
was
proper
in
holding
that
petitioners
were
barred
from
deposing
formal
federal
highway
administrator,
bridwell
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
decisions
under
this
statute
were
made.
and
we
sought
to
depose
formal
federal
highway
administrator,
bridwell
because
the
documents
in
this
case
indicate
that
if
he
wasn't
the
sole
person
who
made
the
determinations
at
least
he
was
intimately
involved
in
any
determination
that
would
have
been
made.
indeed
the
record
never
refers,
at
least,
until
these
documents
submitted
today
there
was
no
reference
in
the
record
to
decision
made
by
former
secretary
boyd.
wherever
his
name
appeared,
it
appeared
jointly
with
federal
highway
administrator
bridwell.
more
over
it
was
mr.
bridwell
who
went
to
congress
to
testify
about
what
occurred
in
this
case.
so
we
noticed
the
deposition
of
mr.
bridwell.
we
have
offered
to
prove
through
his
deposition
that
no
such
determination
was
made.
that
in
fact,
he
merely
delegated
this
to
city
council
of
memphis
and
left
it
up
to
them
to
decide.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
court's
decision
in
morgan
against
united
states
prohibited
any
interrogation
of
the
secretary
as
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
made
these
decisions.
we
believe
that
that
is
erroneous
extension
of
the
morgan
doctrine.
while
morgan
may
prohibit
inquiry
as
to
how
decisions
were
made
it
does
not.
i
believe
this
court's
decisions
in
accardi
case
show
that
it
does
not
prohibit
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
decision
which
is
required
by
law
to
be
made
was
in
fact
made
and
i
think
the
point
is
even
sharpened
more
by
the
fact
that
now
we
have
an
affidavit.
an
affidavit
from
a
man
who
has
not
been
cross
examined,
an
affidavit
which
we
have
not
been
permitted
to
impeach
which
purports
through
what
is
a
disputed
fact.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
would
present
a
much
more
difficult
issue
your
honor,
but
i
think
we
should
be
able
to
interrogate
them
particularly
if
they
are
not
operating
on
the
basis
of
a
contemporaneous
document.
in
other
words,
these
are
not
documents
that
were
written
at
the
time
the
decision
was
made.
these
are,
what
i
characterize
as
litigation
affidavits.
these
are
obviously
prepared
with
the
help
of
a
lawyer,
with
the
scope
of
lawsuit
firmly
in
mind
and
filed
in
the
court
and
i
think
it
would
not
be
an
appropriate
in
circumstances
of
that
nature
to
ask
him,
whether
in
fact
he
made
the
decisions
and
if
so
what
materials
he
had
before
him.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
proper,
and
may
not
be
proper
to
say,
did
you
read
every
page
as
they
tried
to
do
in
morgan
or
did
you
consider
this
factor
on
page
one
and
that
factor
on
page
two.
but
i
think
it
is
fair,
i
think
those
attacking
decisions
must
be
able
to
ascertain
what
decisions
were
made
and
what
the
basis
that
is,
what
the
documents
before
the
person
would
have
been
in
order
that
they
can
seek
a
review
,
in
other
words
they
can
seek
a
review
of
what
he
did
on
the
basis
of
what
he
purportedly
acted
upon.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
would
say
that
in
order
to
cross
examine
in
a
case
such
as
that,
you'd
have
to
make
a
strong
showing
that
there
had
been
some
impropriety.
there
are
cases,
and
i
believe
in
accardi
case
there
was
a
finding
or
in
the
singer
sewing
machine
case
there
were
some
findings
where
these
quasi
judicial
body's
members
i
don't
remember,
people
associated
with
them
were
interrogated.
but
certainly
there
would
be
no
reason
if
we
had
formal
findings
in
this
case,
it
would
take
a
very
strong
showing
in
order
to
interrogate
him
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say,
it
would
even
being
necessary,
if
we
had
the
proper
findings
in
this
case.
but
the
important
fact
is
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
proper
findings
--
of
course,
that
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
based
on
evidence
which
supports
them.
whether
or
not
the
secretary
has
considered
everything,
he
ought
to
have
considered
and
whether
or
not,
what
he
did
consider
supports
what
he
did.
i
think
it's
not,
there
is
no
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct.
it
will
determine,
whether
he
made
a
proper
investigation
and
brought
before
him
the
materials
which
he
ought
to
brought
before
him
for
making
such
determination
and
whether
these
materials
support
his
determination.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
don't
mean
any
formal
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
there
is
in
this
case,
no
specific
administrator
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
we
would
be
limited
to
the
administrative
record.
certainly,
if
we
could
show
that,
that
his
findings
were
not
supported
by
what
is
characterized
as
the
administrative
work
record,
we
would
be
entitled
to
relief,
but
i
think
that
we
should
be
able
to
show,
we
would
also
be
entitled
to
relief
if
he
didn't
prepare
a
proper
record,
but
further
more
if
he
has
considered
matters
which
those
attacking
his
decision
and
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
rebut,
i
think
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
rebut
that
evidence
in
someway
and
if
we
can
cast
some
doubt
on
the
credibility
or
the
substantially
of
these
findings
based
on
evidence
which
we
submitted,
i
think
we
will
be
entitled
to
relief
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
must
be
given
a
right
to
rebut
evidence
which
we
have
not
been
appraised
of
on
which
he
relied
on,
an
evidence
which
we
heretofore
had
not
been
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
question
of
our
standing
is,
i
think
at
least
not
been
opposed
at
this
point.
we
do
have
standing,
i
believe
under
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
we
have
standing,
we
certainly
have
standing
to
present
during
the
course
of
the
administrative
process
at
the
public
caring
and
elsewhere,
we
have
standing
to
present
evidence
to
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
and
there
were
certain
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
they
certainly
were
but
now
the
secretary
offers
another,
if
i
can
give,
your
honor,
one
example,
i
think
it
will
point
out
the
necessity
for
this.
they
say
we
couldn't,
apparently
--
in
document,
they
said
in
their
affidavit,
we
couldn't
like
depressed
route
through
this
park,
because
this
would
require
use
of
a
particularly
type
of
pump
and
this
is
unsafe
in
highway
projects
of
this
nature.
now
if
we
are
not
permitted
to
rebut
that
in
any
way,
we
would
not
be
able
to
show
that
the
department
of
transportation
has
authorized
for
use
in
the
interstate
highway,
the
same
type
of
pump
in
other
areas
and
that
cast
such
strong
doubt
as
to
either
the
investigation
which
he
has
made
to
the
safety
in
this
case,
or
as
to
creditability
of
this
explanation,
that
it's
evidence
i
submit,
should
is
relevant
for
the
consideration
of
the
trial
court.
it
may
send
it
--
it
maybe
relevant
only
to
whether
or
not
he's
made
the
proper
investigation
for
making
his
determination,
but
it's
evidence
of
that
nature.
in
fact,
there
has
been
no
objection
heretofore
on
introducing
such
evidence.
the
secretary
has
never
objected
of
introduction
of
evidence
of
that
nature.
we
have
introduced
affidavits
which
documented
that
the
use
of
siphon
in
department
of
interior
projects,
we
introduced
affidavits
of
the
use
of
this
type
of
pump
that
would
be
required
here,
we
have
introduced
affidavits
as
to
the
type
of
the
use
of
tunnels
in
the
interstate
system.
they
have
not
heretofore
objected
to
that
type
of
evidence.
but
it
would
only
--
i
don't
think
that
this
would
not
be
a
de
novo
advisory
proceeding
in
which
we
tried
out
every
fact.
it
would
only
be
in
case
we
are
able
to
present
some
evidence
which
created
some
dispute
over
whether
what
the
secretary
found
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
record.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
we
can
cross
examine
him
a
little
bit.
we
would
not,
i
say,
be
permitted
to
cross
examine
him
unless
we
would
meet
the
strong
burden
in
the
trial
court
that
suggested
some
impropriety
in
what
he
did.
for
instance,
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
would
be
true
in
this
case
or
whatsoever,
but
as
a
hypothetical
example,
if
there
were
some
evidence
to
indicate
fraud
or
bribery,
it
might
be
that
type
of
attack
on
the
findings
i
believe
it
would
be
proper
and
i
think
we
could
cross
examine.
in
the
accardi
case,
there
was
an
allegation
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
acted
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
attorney
general's
list
that
had
been
published
and
there
the
court
held,
it
was
proper
to
cross
examine.
but
only
after
we
have
met
a
very
strong
burden
of
demonstrating
that
there
is
some
impropriety.
i
think
it
would
shift
the
burden
to
us,
it
would
place
a
very
heavy
burden
upon
us
but
in
the
general
case,
in
the
usual
case,
i
would
suggest
that
we
would
not
cross
examine
in
those
circumstances,
but
in
this
particular
case,
where
have
this
affidavit
of
secretary,
former
secretary
boyd,
we
do
have
evidence
which
will
dispute
this.
i
am
not
so
concerned
about
cross
examining
secretary
board
as
i
am
presenting
that
evidence.
and
it's
interesting
the
reason
it
hasn't
been
presented
heretofore
is
because
former
highway
administrator
bridwell
said
he
didn't
think
it
was
proper
when
i
talked
to
him,
to
present
this
by
affidavit.
he
thought
it
was
better
if
he
wouldn't
take
side,
that
we
would
testify
in
court
and
let
both
sides
have
a
shot
at
him.
we
weren't
permitted
to
put
him
on
the
stand
to
have
him
testify.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no
i
don't
but
i
am
simply
explaining
why
we
don't
have
an
affidavit
of
the
same
nature
that
they
do
here
today.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well
the
certificate
of
allen
boyd
says,
in
april
of
1968,
he
made
a
decision
that
there
was
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
routing
the
highway
generally
along
in
the
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
on
this
affidavit
but
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well
there
are
very
vague
allegations
in
an
affidavit
that
in
1968,
secretary
boyd
and
former
federal
highway
administrator,
bridwell
reaffirmed
a
previous
decision
and
that's
the
extent
of
the
documentation.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
they
claimed
it
was
made
in
1956,
but
that
other
evidence
in
the
record
which
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
not
that
shows
that
these
decisions
were
made,
not
that
it
says
these
decisions
were
made.
in
fact
the
record
indicate,
the
affidavit
of
volpe
refers
to
another
determination
in
1969.
the
record
is
equally
unclear
on
that
point.
finally,
the
third
point
which
we
submit
should
be
resolved
by
this
court
before
any
remand
which
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
understand
is
conceded
is
necessary
in
this
case,
would
be
the
appropriate
standard
of
review.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
the
only
standard
of
review
is
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
the
administrative
procedure
act
posses
that
is
the
minimum
constitutional
requirement.
so
the
legislative
history
says
and
the
act
we
believe
requires
a
court
to
go
further
and
even
if
the
finding
is
not
arbitrary
capricious,
it
requires
a
review
of
the
evidence
to
support
it.
either
under
the
substantial
evidence
standard
or
the
unwarranted
by
the
fact
standard,
we
believe
that
the
court
below
was
in
error
in
limiting
its
review
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
respondents
in
this
case
traditionally
start
each
argument
with
the
statement
that
this
highway
will
run
along
a
bus
route
through
the
park,
and
the
implication
being
we'll
have
practically
no
effect
on
this.
this
bus
route
which
is
displayed
here
is
narrow
facility,
some
25
feet
wide,
on
which
buses
run
through
about
once
in
an
hour,
in
fact
it's
so
narrow
that
the
trees
from
the
wooded
part
of
the
park
hang
over
the
bus
route
freely
crossed
by
pedestrians.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
the
bus
route
is
only
used
for
about
one
bus
an
hour,
no
cars,
no
other
traffic.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
and
trucks
that
interstate
--
for
commercial
and
passenger
vehicles.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
freight,
trucks.
the
statements
which
they
claim
is
unwarranted.
the
statement
would
says
there
won't
be
much
of
a
wooded
area
left
in
the
park,
that's
not
a
statement
we
made.
that's
a
statement
that
an
official
of
department
of
interior
made,
a
department
which
the
secretary
is
statue
found
to
consult
with
on
projects
of
this
nature.
it
is
a
document,
fully
part
of
the
administrative
record.
they
don't
seek
to
dispute
that.
they
within
any
other
evidence
they
simply
say
it
can't
be
right.
we
submit
that
department
of
interior
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
but
i
think
what
the
official
had
in
mind,
not
that
a
major
part
of
the
woodland
would
be
taken.
there
will
be
a
450
foot
right-of-way
through
that
area.
but
what
he
meant
was,
not
only
that
you
take
the
450
feet,
but
you
really
destroy
the
rest
of
the
park
because
immediately
you
don't
have
a
woodland
park,
immediately
adjacent
to
the
highway,
if
you
got
a
six
lane
interstate
highway
going.
you
have
beside
the
sound,
the
general
pollution
associate
with
these
highways,
which
spread
further
than
the
right-of-way.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
450
feet
in
the
wooded
area
of
the
park,
and
i
think
anyone
who
has
ever
stood
anywhere
close
to
an
interstate
highway
of
this
nature
knows
that
the
effects
don't
stops
at
the
age
of
the
pavement
and
i
think
your
honor
that's
what
the
department
of
interior
official
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
there
is
very
i
--
it's
not
clear
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
but
this
was
showed
as
i
think
in
the
case
are
very
narrow.
that's
one
of
the
points
i
made
also
that
they
didn't
take
very
much.
a
second
point
which
they
raise
is
that
the
right-of-way
for
this
route
was
acquired
long
before
the
decision
--
was
acquired
after
the
decisions
were
made.
in
fact,
the
department
of
transportation
authorized
the
acquisitions
for
the
right-of-way
of
this
project
before
they
ever
made
any
effort
to
comply
with
the
statute.
even
if
we
assume,
what
the
solicitor
general
says
is
correct,
and
even
if
we
assume
what
is
stated
in
these
certificates
are
right,
the
department
of
transportation
told
the
state
to
go
ahead
and
acquire
the
land
for
this
project
in
may
1967,
a
month
after
the
statue
was
affected,
but
11
months
before
any
effort
was
made
to
comply
with
it.
and
i
submit
that
right-of-way
acquired
under
that
authorization
is
acquired
illegally
which
should
not
prejudice
the
petitioners'
position.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i'll
be
able
to
show
your
honor,
that
in
my
test,
my
evidence
would
show
that
the
officials
of
the
department
of
transportation
left
this
decision
solely
to
the
city
council
of
memphis.
they
went
down
and
made
an
explanation,
and
they
although
they
pointed
out
alternatives
both
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
of
the
park,
they
never
decided
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
department
of
transportation,
that
these
alternatives,
whether
these
alternatives
were
prudent
and
feasible.
they
attempted
to
delegate
to
the
city
council,
and
once
a
city
council
made
up
its
mind,
they
simply
rubber
stamped
that.
they
approved
the
highway
without
ever
making
their
own
independent
judgment
as
to
whether
they
were
feasible
and
prudent
alternatives.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
well,
that's
what
mr.
bridwell
would
testified
to.
i
think
it's
also
supported
by
the
evidence,
his
testimony
before
the
congress
which
is
in
exhibit
in
this
case,
but
that's
what
secretary
bridwell
would
testify
to.
and
i
think
that
even
in
footnote
25
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
he
concedes
that
the
statute
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
secretary
of
transportation,
to
make
an
independent
determination,
and
we
will
show
that
independent
determination
was
never
made
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
say,
we
have
evidence
which
would
dispute
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
that's
correct,
didn't
even
make
a
minimal
determination.
further
with
respect
to
the
design,
we
would
show
that
designs
which
they
reject
as
impossible
are
in
fact
designs
which
are
clearly
possible.
they
are
the
types
of
designs
that
are
used
through
out
the
interstate
highway
system
and
clearly
possible
here.
and
that
there
is
no
basis
--
i
don't
know
on
what
basis
they
can
possibly
say
that
they
were
impossible
in
terms
of
the
statute,
but
we'll
prove
they
certainly
were
possible.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
oh,
no.
i
have
no
ground
of
which
to
question
that.
no
i
simply
say
--
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
no,
i
don't
have
the
authenticity
on
these
pieces
of
paper.
i
merely
say
that
i
think
we
would
have
evidence
to
contradict
it.
furthermore
there
was
a
reference
made
to
the
legislative
history.
i
think
that's
a
misnomer.
for
the
legislative
materials
to
which
the
solicitor
general
refers,
are
not
history
at
all.
those
are
materials
that
were
created
or
put
in
the
congressional
record
over
year
after
the
the
statute
was
passed.
this
statute
was
passed
i
believe
by
the
89th
congress
in
1966,
and
all
of
the
materials
to
which
he
refers
are
the
materials
taken
from
the
90th
congress
in
1968,
hardly
we
submit
legislative
history.
mr.
john
w.
vardaman,
jr.
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
relevant
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
those
statements
were
made
generally
by
people
who
opposed
this
statute
in
the
beginning,
who
tried
to
amend
it
to
weaken
the
statute
and
in
fact
the
secretary
of
transportation
opposed
any
amendment.
so
they
were
in
effect
efforts
to
cut
down
the
force
of
this
statute
on
the
floor
of
the
congress.
we
submit
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face
(inaudible)
interpreting
by
looking
at
the
statute.
finally,
i
would
say
to
your
honors
that
this
case
is
not
only
important
to
my
clients,
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
but
the
people
of
memphis.
this
case
has
great
importance
to
the
people
of
this
nation.
the
importance
of
this
statute
is
one
which
will
drastically
effect
at
least
the
battle
to
preserve
this
nation's
environment
against
projects
such
as
that
involved
here.
thank
you.
