justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
vardaman,
what
are
the
issues
that
you
are
presenting
to
us?
is
the
first
one,
whether
or
not
he
has
made
the
required
statutory
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
he
had,
your
second
issue
or
at
least
one
of
your
issues
is
that
his
findings
are
infirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
your
first
point
be
mooted
if
he
presented
in
this
court
a
piece
of
paper
that
made
the
findings
that
you
say
are
missing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
his
brief
pretty
well
makes
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
he
nevertheless
could
moot
the
point
by
presenting
a
piece
of
paper,
if
he
hasn't
already
had
done
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
--
and
the
second
point,
your
second
is
what,
is
that
his
decision
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
presented
affidavit
and
affidavit
saying
that
he
had
made
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assuming
it,
assuming
you
didn't
get
by,
you
didn't
prevail
on
those
two
points,
what
standard,
assume
that
the
secretary
has
made
the
findings
here
simply
challenging
their
sufficiency,
what
standard
are
you
urging
the
courts
must
use
in
reviewing
administrative
procedures?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
not
by
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
to
give
notices
and
go
through
the
hearings
and
take
the
evidence
under
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
hanover,
at
the
time
of
this
act
was
passed,
when
was
it,
in
1969?
justice
byron
r.
white
1968.
prior
to
that
time,
the
route
had
already
been
selected
through
the
park
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
prior
laws
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
had
the
state
prior
to
passage
of
the
new
act
required
right-of-way?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
had
they
acquired
the
route
through
the
park,
the
right-of-way
through
the
park
prior
to
the
passage
the
new
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
all,
all
the
right-of-way
outside
the
park
had
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
had
there
been
clearing
of
the
right-of-way
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
new
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about,
how
close
to
the
part
that
clearing
or
construction
taken
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
the
right-of-way
have
been
acquired?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
speaking
as
of
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
new
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
–
if
the
court
was
--
you
say
we
could
it
as
the
petition
for
certiorari.
if
we
granted
it,
i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
you
would
prefer
the
briefing
and
arguments
and
the
delay
to
immediate
decision
on
the
merits
now.
if
we
granted
it
that
probably
would
be
stay.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
rather
have
this
grant
in
the
stay
and
the
opportunity
to
argue
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
you
don't
think
you
briefed
the
merits
sufficiently
for
your
purposes
at
this
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
though
--
you
have
submit
you
want
to
get
in
before
the
court
decides
the
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
provision
that
required
the
secretary
to
think
this
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
since
1966
he
has
had
to
make
this
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
has
been
on
the
books
since
1966?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
secretary
has
been
arguing
about
the
federal-aid
highway
act
that
after
the
effective
date
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act
1968,
the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
programs?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
after
the
effective
date
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
highways?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
if
the
federal-aid
highway
act
had
never
been
passed,
you
would
still
be
here
on
the
same
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
the
federal-aid
highway
act
has
superseded
that
and
gave
a
new
date
for
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
vardaman,
what
are
the
issues
that
you
are
presenting
to
us?
is
the
first
one,
whether
or
not
he
has
made
the
required
statutory
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
he
had,
your
second
issue
or
at
least
one
of
your
issues
is
that
his
findings
are
infirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
your
first
point
be
mooted
if
he
presented
in
this
court
a
piece
of
paper
that
made
the
findings
that
you
say
are
missing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
his
brief
pretty
well
makes
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
he
nevertheless
could
moot
the
point
by
presenting
a
piece
of
paper,
if
he
hasn't
already
had
done
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
--
and
the
second
point,
your
second
is
what,
is
that
his
decision
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
presented
affidavit
and
affidavit
saying
that
he
had
made
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assuming
it,
assuming
you
didn't
get
by,
you
didn't
prevail
on
those
two
points,
what
standard,
assume
that
the
secretary
has
made
the
findings
here
simply
challenging
their
sufficiency,
what
standard
are
you
urging
the
courts
must
use
in
reviewing
administrative
procedures?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
not
by
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
to
give
notices
and
go
through
the
hearings
and
take
the
evidence
under
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
hanover,
at
the
time
of
this
act
was
passed,
when
was
it,
in
1969?
justice
byron
r.
white
1968.
prior
to
that
time,
the
route
had
already
been
selected
through
the
park
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
prior
laws
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
had
the
state
prior
to
passage
of
the
new
act
required
right-of-way?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
had
they
acquired
the
route
through
the
park,
the
right-of-way
through
the
park
prior
to
the
passage
the
new
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
all,
all
the
right-of-way
outside
the
park
had
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
had
there
been
clearing
of
the
right-of-way
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
new
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about,
how
close
to
the
part
that
clearing
or
construction
taken
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
the
right-of-way
have
been
acquired?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
speaking
as
of
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
new
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
–
if
the
court
was
--
you
say
we
could
it
as
the
petition
for
certiorari.
if
we
granted
it,
i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
you
would
prefer
the
briefing
and
arguments
and
the
delay
to
immediate
decision
on
the
merits
now.
if
we
granted
it
that
probably
would
be
stay.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
rather
have
this
grant
in
the
stay
and
the
opportunity
to
argue
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
you
don't
think
you
briefed
the
merits
sufficiently
for
your
purposes
at
this
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
though
--
you
have
submit
you
want
to
get
in
before
the
court
decides
the
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
provision
that
required
the
secretary
to
think
this
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
since
1966
he
has
had
to
make
this
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
has
been
on
the
books
since
1966?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
secretary
has
been
arguing
about
the
federal-aid
highway
act
that
after
the
effective
date
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act
1968,
the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
programs?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
after
the
effective
date
of
the
federal-aid
highway
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
highways?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
if
the
federal-aid
highway
act
had
never
been
passed,
you
would
still
be
here
on
the
same
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
the
federal-aid
highway
act
has
superseded
that
and
gave
a
new
date
for
it
--
