what
is
the

black
how
much
of

taken?
justice

black
what
was
their
stand

justice

what
i
am

what
they
base
that
if
they
had
–
what
was
the
standard
that
would
have
been
followed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
only
reason,
i
have
presume
this
suit
involved
taking
a
fresh
bill
is
because
it
was
in
a
park
and
you
didn't
have
them?
justice

black
yeah,
that's
the
reason
it
didn't
involve

are
you
taking
a
position
that
the

(inaudible)
considered

let

what

they
say
about

is
there
anything
in

that
indicates
that?
justice

black
indicates
that
standard
--
justice
hugo

black
made

supported
or
just
made?
justice

black
how
many
other

are
there
--
justice

black
do
you
think
the

applies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
raise
any
question
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the

justice
hugo
l.
black
you
agree
that
congress
has
the
power
in
passing
on
these

pass
along
to
say
the
city
park
shall
not
be
taken,
except
under
certain
circumstances?
justice

black
but
you
think
it
applies
to
this

justice

l.
black
what
difference
does
it
makes
whether
it
applies
to
the
state
of
tennessee,
if
it
applies
to
the

justice
hugo

black
is
the

is
the

north,
the

the

justice

black
what
is
the

where
the

where
it
--
justice

black
yes.
justice

black
and
of

if
there
is
--
i
am
not
talking
about
feasible,
i
don't
know
what's
a
feasible
alternative?
justice
hugo

black
but
i
presumed
that
that
place
like
many
others,
could
be
entered
either
from
the
northern
part
or
the
southern
part,
to
go
around
the
edges
and
would
not
interfere
either
with
the

all
these

justice

they
are
already
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
problem
with
them?
justice
hugo

i
would
assume
that
a

built

northern

built
across
the
southern

as
far
as
time
is
concerned,
would
be
no

would
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
that
petition
or
do
you
consent
to
that
petition?
that
if
the

takes
the
case,
it
should
decide
it
on
this
argument
and
there
is
enough
evidence
to
decide
it?
justice

black
is
that
(voice

you
think
and
to
allow

take

justice

black
what
kind
of

would
you
suffer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
based
on
the

you
bought
this

and
i
would
assume
in
the

memphis,
if
that
isn't
in

the

will
be

so
forth
--

you
would
agree
i
suppose
as

as
the

is
concerned
that
there
is
no

they
have
attempted
to
put
a
considerable
burden
on

before
they
destroy
a
city's
public

the

justice

is
it

as
i
have
thought
not

the

justice
hugo

black
i
thought
that

it

is
what
