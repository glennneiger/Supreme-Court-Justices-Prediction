mr.
j.
alan
hanover
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
tennessee
i
think
that
i
might
for
a
moment
digress
and
help
possibly
answer
some
factual
questions
that
members
of
the
court
have
asked
which
of
course
are
very
difficult
for
reynolds
to
ask.
he
having
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
the
park
i
live
there.
an
answer
to
the
question
a
moment
ago,
how
many
parks
are
in
memphis
state?
the
record
shows
that
the
city
of
memphis
at
the
present
time
has
some
47,000
acres
of
parks
within
it's
borders.
we
are
talking
of
course
about
26
acres
out
of
a
340
or
50
acre
park.
of
course,
it
should
it
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
zoo
has
always
been
a
separate
entity
from
the
park
itself.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes.
i
might
have
that
point
out
then
possibly
i
could
do
both
at
the
same
time.
the
zoo
has
always
been
a
separate
entity
from
the
park,
has
always
been
served
historically
for
over
a
50
or
60
years
by
this
bus
route
which
many
years
ago
was
a
street
car
route
and
formally
a
little
narrow
gauge
railroad.
the
only
entrance
to
the
zoo,
from
the
south
has
always
been
at
this
point
and
will
be
continued
by
means
of
a
pedestrian
walkway
over
the
depressed
area
of
the
expressway.
basically,
the
position
of
the
state
of
tennessee
is
that
we
should
not
be
stayed,
not
by
reason
of
any
eleventh
amendment
issue
which
we
have
raised
and
did
not
intend
to
claim
sovereign
immunity.
i
fielded
in
mr.
vardaman's
brief,
he
possibly
misunderstood
something.
i
said
it
in
my
brief,
the
state
felt
that
it
had
a
vital
interest
in
this
case
not
only
from
a
cost
standpoint,
but
from
a
duty
to
its
citizens
delay,
safety,
future
maintenance
of
this
road.
the
state
doesn't
feel
that
it
should
be
stayed
for
the
reason
that
there
are
no
constitutional
issues
in
this
case,
that
is
the
state
of
tennessee
has
not
been
accused
of,
in
this
case
whatsoever
of
violating
anyone's
constitutional
rights
and
the
statute
itself
does
not
run
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
only
places
a
burden
upon
the
secretary
of
transportation.
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
way
is
because
the
state
has
expended
and
paid
for
the
land
in
question,
and
all
of
the
land
to
each
side
of
the
park.
in
that
connection,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
east
west
express
way
is
approximately
12
miles
long
and
extends
from
the
eastern
edge
of
the
city,
to
the
mississippi
river
which
has
been
correctly
stated
as
being
the
western
boundary
of
the
town.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
it
is
the
only
present
planned
method
of
bringing
traffic
from
our
downtown
area
which
is
on
the
western
edge
rather
than
centrally
located
as
in
most
cities
to
the
eastern
heavy
residential
areas.
now
the
state
has
purchased
this
and
it's
our
belief
that
the
state
should
be
the
master
of
it's
own
destiny
in
a
federal
aid
situation
that
if
the
route
should
later
be
changed,
if
changes
should
be
made
which
either
cause
delay
or
a
cost
which
the
state
may
not
wish
to
participate
in,
it's
going
to
be
left
with
this
$2
million
expenditure
which
we
may
or
may
not
get
back
from
the
department
of
transportation.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
1968.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir,
they
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
had
acquired
right-of-way
your
honor,
all
the
way
on
the
eastern
and
western
edges
leading
up
to
these
last
two
segments,
or
the
last
two,
bringing
it
to
the
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no
sir.
that
was
acquired
after
mr.
boyd's
letter
which
mr.
reynolds
read,
i
acquired
that
myself
for
the
negotiations
with
the
city
of
memphis
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
practically,
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
filed
one
year
ago,
all
but
two
parcels
in
this
12-mile
stretch
had
been
acquired.
since
that
time,
all
has
been
acquired.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir
and
construction
in
various
segments
on
each
side.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
clearing
or
construction,
your
honor,
prior
to
the
passage
of,
or
prior
to
this
case,
and
occurred
in
this
general
area
within,
i
would
estimate
within
half-mile
or
less
or
the
park
on
each
side.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir,
at
the
time
this
case
was
filed,
there
were
one
or
only
two
minor
easements
out
of
some
1700
parcels,
the
park
being
one
that
has
not
been
acquired.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
estimate
that
at
time
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record
from
either
side.
i
would
estimate
based
on
personal
experience
that
i
would
say
two-thirds
to
three-fourths
had
been
acquired
by
1968.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
think
the
act
applies,
your
honor,
in
this
situation
only
to
the
question
of
whether
all
possible
half
of
the
things
have
been
done
to
minimize
harm
of
the
park.
i
think
the
route
question
was
settled
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir
i
agree
with
that.
i
just
don't
think
this
particular
act
applies
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
i
think
it
only
applies
to
the
secretary
of
transportation.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
do.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
your
honor,
that
it
affects
whether
or
not
the
secretary
can
grant
federal
aid.
i
don't
think
it
affects
the
state's
right
to
build
a
highway
which
it
feels
it
needs
through
a
park
without
federal
aid.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
you
mean
the
entire
i-40?
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
agree
with
--
i
would
say
that
there
would
not
be
--
the
point
is
your
honor
that
it's
done
and
approved
in
sections.
the
state
never
knows
until
it's
completed
whether
or
not
the
federal
aid
will
be
forthcoming.
it's
more
in
a
nature
of
a
unilateral
contract
which
the
federal
government
says,
if
you
build
this
road
in
a
certain
way,
we
will
pay
our
portion.
there
is
no
requirement
that
state
build
it,
the
federal
government
cannot
make
them
build
it
and
when
i
get
through,
they
may
say
you
haven't
complied
with
our
standards,
we
won't
pay.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
that's
correct.
that's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
the
statement
should
then
have
the
right
to,
excuse
me
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
to
re-evaluate
its
position
it
may
wish
to
decide
to
do
that,
anyway,
it's
always
been
the
state's
position
even
before
the
road
has
reached
the
end
and
that
was
the
only
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
for
the
city
of
memphis,
it's
patterns
and
it's
for
various
other
things
that
should
be
considered
in
the
building
of
this
road.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
this
is
east.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
the
width
of
the
city
at
this
point.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
estimate,
your
honor,
that
that's
about
four
to
five
miles
of
the
center
of
the
city.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
the
only
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
on
three
sides
of
the
park,
where
i
am
pointing
our
three
of
the
largest
through
fares
in
the
city,
which
of
course
handle
great
body
of
traffic.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
they
are
already
there.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no,
sir
and
of
course,
the
point
is
that
it
would
affect
i
am
sure
engineering
wise,
the
use
of
the
express
way
if
you
did
away
with
some
other
major
thorough
fare
and
building
of
which
just
being
canceling
out
what
you
are
doing.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
i
don't
think
you
would
take
any
longer
to
construct.
the
problem
is
that
all
of
these
people
are
already
moved
and
the
houses
are
already
torn
down
and
the
state
owns
all
of
these
right-of-way.
the
only
other
point
that
we
wished
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
is
that
in
the
event
that
this
court
does
feel
that
a
stay
is
proper,
we
do
feel,
the
state
feels
that
it
is
a
proper
case
for
some
security.
we
realize
of
course,
that
security
is
a
matter
of
discretion
with
this
court,
but
the
state
has
been
stayed
off
and
on
in
this
matter
for
over
a
year.
they
originally
had
a
letting
plan
last
november
1969,
and
because
of
a
stay
order
issued
by
the
district
court,
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
do
anything
until
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
released
the
injunction.
at
that
time,
the
state
did
move
ahead
properly,
in
view
of
fact
that
this
road
has
been
in
progress
for
all
most
15
years
and
did
let
a
contract.
we
gave
that
information
to
the
court,
so
the
court
could
see
how
rising
costs
have
affected
the
state.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
arguments
presented
that
it
would
hurt
the
petitioners
or
deny
them
any
rights.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
we
do
not
object
to
job,
your
honor.
i
would
feel
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
we
should
have
been
given
the
opportunity
to
file
some
possible
additional
briefs
within
a
very
short
period
of
time,
if
the
court
chose
to
do
that
since
we
did
not
cover
all
of
those
issues
at
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
your
honor
naturally
the
delay
is
something
that
we
have
been
fighting,
or
that
i
have
been
fighting
for
some
time
and
we
do
want
to
expedite
it,
although
we
do
feel
that
the
state
is
entitled
and
the
commissioner
too,
i
mean,
it
could
be
damaged
heavily
without
security.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
think
they
should
post
a
bond,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
estimate,
again
your
honor
this
is
based
on
knowledge
that
i
am
not
fully
aware
of
it
on
times,
how
long
it
would
take
but
i
would
estimate
a
bond
for
â€“
in
the
neighborhood
of
$250,000
to
$500,000
would
be
sufficient
rather
than
a
multi-million
dollar
bond
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
seems
to
think,
we
are
required.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
we
will
suffer,
as
we
already
have
in
the
past
year,
the
bid,
proposed
bid
by
the
same
low
bidder
a
year
ago
was
$613,000
less
than
it
is
today.
so,
in
the
last
year,
cost
for
building
this
identical
engineering
design
have
risen
$613,000.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
don't
know
what
the
state
can
do
with
it,
your
honor.
the
city
has
already
spend
most
of
the
money.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
we
might
--
hate
to
be
factious,
but
i
don't
know
what
the
city
could
do
with
this
26
acre
strip
in
the
park.
i
am
sure
we
couldn't
get
the
money
back
in
the
city.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
the
approaches
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
the
houses
are
gone.
they
have
all
been,
they
have
dead
land
that
has
been
leveled
and
is
ready
for
construction.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
he
is
the
low
bidder,
who
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
--
was
awarded
the
contract.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no
government
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir,
i
think
the
bond
should
run
to
both
and
i
think
both
parties
need
be
protected,
not
just
the
state.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
of
course,
we
have
no
guarantee
your
honor
that
when
it's
over
with
that
for
some
other
reason
they
may
deny
federal
aid.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
we
have
no
reason
to
know
at
this
time
when
the
road
is
completed
even
though
this
way
that
for
some
other
reasons,
the
department
may
say,
we
are
not
going
to
pay
federal
aid
and
they
may
feel
that
we
have
not
handled
something
else
in
a
proper
manner,
which
often
happens.
they
have
that
right
to
withhold
the
aid
until
the
state
has
completed
the
project
and
expended
their
funds
and
shown
the
department
that
they
have
done
everything
according
to
the
requirements.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
think
that
congress
rightly
so
has
required
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
secretary
to
be
very
careful
before
a
road
is
put
through
parks
and
that
should
not
be
done
except
frankly
the
situation
of
this
nature
where
the
damage
to
the
park
is
rather
(inaudible)
and
no
facility
whatsoever
of
this
park
will
be
hampered.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
agree.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
and
i
agree
your
honor
that
this
will
still
be
a
park
just
as
it
is
when
this
road
is
completed.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
slightly
smaller
park.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
slightly
smaller
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
the
city
of
memphis
maintains
a
non-access
concrete
diesel
bus
route
which
around
roughly
your
honor
in
the
center
of
where
this
right-of-way
is
now
going.
it's
the
pavement
itself
is
25
to
30
feet
wide
and
has
a
clear
right-of-way
of
say
40
to
50
feet
wide.
and
the
route
purposes
to
stay
on
that,
that's
the
reason
that
this
job
was
made
instead
of
coming
straight
across
in
the
first
place,
was
to
stay
on
the
natural
separation
that
the
park
has
always
had,
and
to
avoid
any
damage
to
the
park
property.
that's
the
very
reason
it's
designed
to
follow
this
slightly
raised
route
as
it
came
toward
the
park,
to
stay
with
that
historical
division.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
not
at
this
time
attempt
to
restate
the
facts
or
using
time
for
that
purpose,
since
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
them
quite
well
to
the
court.
i've
being
the
only
attorney
at
the
bar
today
who
has
played
in
this
park.
i
do
feel
that
i
probably
know
more
the
details
than
either
of
my
colleagues.
i
would
be
of
course
happy
to
answer
questions
in
that
vein
but
i
will
pass
from
the
facts
to
take
up
what
i
feel
are
the
issues
that
affects
this
case,
and
affect
my
client,
the
state
of
tennessee.
i
think
the
best
place
to
start
any
argument
is
at
the
beginning
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court,
if
i
went
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
case,
as
it
will
help
you
to
understand
all
five
issues
in
this
case.
and
the
beginning
of
this
case
is
the
beginning
of
any
case
is
the
pleadings
and
the
complaint
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
sets
up
the
case,
it
sets
up
the
standard
of
judicial
review
and
it
sets
up
what
type
of
judicial
review
should
be
had
in
this
case.
in
the
petitioners'
original
complaint,
they
charge
that
the
secretary
didn't
make
findings,
that
is
really
the
only
basic
issue
in
the
lawsuit.
actually,
although,
i
was
glad
to
see
this
morning
the
affidavits
are
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
of
course,
the
other
affidavits
in
the
record
as
to
approval
of
the
route
and
reaffirmation
actually
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
before
this
court,
none
of
those
affidavits
were
actually
necessary.
the
complaint
filed
by
mr.
vardaman
states
all
of
the
necessary
facts
for
this
determination.
he
states
that
secretary
boyd
approved
the
route
and
of
course,
the
word
approved
is
the
keyword
in
the
statute.
there
is
no
dispute
concerning
the
approval.
there
is
no
dispute
concerning
the
final
approval
of
the
route
design
in
november
1969.
since
the
complaint
filed
by
the
petitioner
states
all
of
those
facts,
and
therefore
they
admit
it.
he
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
findings
as
such
were
required
under
the
parkland
statute
and
in
the
record,
in
the
appendix,
you'll
see
as
cited
in
our
brief,
the
colloquy
that
it
occurred
between
mr.
vardaman
and
district
judge
brown
on
this
very
point,
as
to
what
the
issues
were
and
what
he
was
contending.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
specific
findings
are
necessary
under
the
act
and
that
is,
of
course,
i
think
the
main
problem
that
this
court
has
to
face.
if
this
court
believes
as
i
do,
and
as
the
solicitor
general
does
that
this
is
a
discretionary
statute
that
congress
gave
the
secretary
of
transportation,
a
discretion
to
make
this
decision
and
that
findings
as
such
or
not
require
by
the
statute
or
by
either
the
application
or
non-application
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
feel
i
have
discuss
quite
fully
in
our
brief
that
it
does
not
apply
to
discretionary
decision
of
this
type,
that
the
court
can
reach
its
conclusion
and
end
this
case
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
point
alone.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
as
contrasted
mr.
justice
black
to
a
ministerial
duty.
he
has
to
exercise
judge,
he
has
to
exercise
his
judgment
rather
than
the
judgment
of
mr.
vardaman
or
the
solicitor
general
or
myself
or
any
of
the
protagonist
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no,
sir.
i
will
take
that
point
right
now.
i
tend
to
agree
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
solicitor
general,
although
we
do
disagree
on
one
or
two
other
points
in
this
case,
regarding
administrative
record,
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
apply,
but
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
does
or
not,
the
result
in
the
case
is
the
same.
now
the
question
of
review,
as
i
stated
earlier
the
complaint
filed
about
mr.
vardaman
does
not
charge
secretary
volpe
with
any
misconduct.
it's
always
been
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
when
you
challenge
the
actions
of
an
administrator
and
you
want
to
have
a
review
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
arbitrary
or
capricious,
you
must
allege
some
fact
to
bring
it
before
the
court
to
have
a
trial
on
the
merits
which
is
what
mr.
vardaman
ultimately
wants.
they
didn't
say,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
didn't
even
make
a
conclusory
allegation
that
secretary
volpe
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
they
just
said
he
didn't
make
any
findings.
now
this
court
holds
the
findings
he
must
make,
that's
the
end
of
that
issue.
if
the
court
holds
that
findings
he
need
not
make,
that
again
is
a
dispositive
to
the
issue.
now
it's
not
that
he
is
precluded
from
judicial
review
or
this
court
is
precluded
from
reviewing
case.
it's
because
he
did
not
allege
facts
that
warrant
judicial
review
beyond
what
he
has
here
today.
if
he
had
said
that
secretary
volpe
laid
this
route
out
because
he
had
a
relative
nearby
who'd
profit
from
the
sale
of
his
land
or
the
enhancement
of
its
value
or
that
he
deliberately
refused
to
consider
evidence
or
that
he
deliberately
chose
engineers
to
advise
him
and
whom
he
knew
were
not
properly
trained,
that
maybe
the
basis
for
a
review
beyond
the
sculpt
that
we
have
here
on
the
question
of
summary
judgment,
but
he
did
not.
he
just
simply
said,
he
made
no
findings
although
he
admittedly
admits
that
he
approved
the
route.
now
going
from
that,
there
are
many
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
to
the
effect
that
with
those
allegations,
you
can
go
farther
and
you
can
question
the
secretary.
i
would
think
that
if
he
had
charged
secretary
volpe
with
some
improper
conduct,
he
would
have
a
prefect
right
to
examine
him
on
that
point.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
he
just
didn't
allege
any
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
he
only
alleged,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
these
various
routes
have
been
approved,
the
designs
have
been
approved
and
that
the
secretary
has
failed
to
make
findings.
now,
we've
quoted
that
extensively
in
our
brief
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
in
conclusion
i
again
ask
the
court
to,
before
determining
the
standard
of
judicial
review
or
the
question
of
whether
the
secretary
or
federal
administrator
bridwell
should
have
been
opposed,
to
carefully
examine
the
pleadings
to
determine
what
the
issues
are.
i
think
all
of
the
other
issues
fall
into
place,
after
you
see
what
the
petitioners
are
actually
claiming
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
tennessee
i
think
that
i
might
for
a
moment
digress
and
help
possibly
answer
some
factual
questions
that
members
of
the
court
have
asked
which
of
course
are
very
difficult
for
reynolds
to
ask.
he
having
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
the
park
i
live
there.
an
answer
to
the
question
a
moment
ago,
how
many
parks
are
in
memphis
state?
the
record
shows
that
the
city
of
memphis
at
the
present
time
has
some
47,000
acres
of
parks
within
it's
borders.
we
are
talking
of
course
about
26
acres
out
of
a
340
or
50
acre
park.
of
course,
it
should
it
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
zoo
has
always
been
a
separate
entity
from
the
park
itself.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes.
i
might
have
that
point
out
then
possibly
i
could
do
both
at
the
same
time.
the
zoo
has
always
been
a
separate
entity
from
the
park,
has
always
been
served
historically
for
over
a
50
or
60
years
by
this
bus
route
which
many
years
ago
was
a
street
car
route
and
formally
a
little
narrow
gauge
railroad.
the
only
entrance
to
the
zoo,
from
the
south
has
always
been
at
this
point
and
will
be
continued
by
means
of
a
pedestrian
walkway
over
the
depressed
area
of
the
expressway.
basically,
the
position
of
the
state
of
tennessee
is
that
we
should
not
be
stayed,
not
by
reason
of
any
eleventh
amendment
issue
which
we
have
raised
and
did
not
intend
to
claim
sovereign
immunity.
i
fielded
in
mr.
vardaman's
brief,
he
possibly
misunderstood
something.
i
said
it
in
my
brief,
the
state
felt
that
it
had
a
vital
interest
in
this
case
not
only
from
a
cost
standpoint,
but
from
a
duty
to
its
citizens
delay,
safety,
future
maintenance
of
this
road.
the
state
doesn't
feel
that
it
should
be
stayed
for
the
reason
that
there
are
no
constitutional
issues
in
this
case,
that
is
the
state
of
tennessee
has
not
been
accused
of,
in
this
case
whatsoever
of
violating
anyone's
constitutional
rights
and
the
statute
itself
does
not
run
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
only
places
a
burden
upon
the
secretary
of
transportation.
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
way
is
because
the
state
has
expended
and
paid
for
the
land
in
question,
and
all
of
the
land
to
each
side
of
the
park.
in
that
connection,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
east
west
express
way
is
approximately
12
miles
long
and
extends
from
the
eastern
edge
of
the
city,
to
the
mississippi
river
which
has
been
correctly
stated
as
being
the
western
boundary
of
the
town.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
it
is
the
only
present
planned
method
of
bringing
traffic
from
our
downtown
area
which
is
on
the
western
edge
rather
than
centrally
located
as
in
most
cities
to
the
eastern
heavy
residential
areas.
now
the
state
has
purchased
this
and
it's
our
belief
that
the
state
should
be
the
master
of
it's
own
destiny
in
a
federal
aid
situation
that
if
the
route
should
later
be
changed,
if
changes
should
be
made
which
either
cause
delay
or
a
cost
which
the
state
may
not
wish
to
participate
in,
it's
going
to
be
left
with
this
$2
million
expenditure
which
we
may
or
may
not
get
back
from
the
department
of
transportation.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
1968.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir,
they
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
had
acquired
right-of-way
your
honor,
all
the
way
on
the
eastern
and
western
edges
leading
up
to
these
last
two
segments,
or
the
last
two,
bringing
it
to
the
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no
sir.
that
was
acquired
after
mr.
boyd's
letter
which
mr.
reynolds
read,
i
acquired
that
myself
for
the
negotiations
with
the
city
of
memphis
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
practically,
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
filed
one
year
ago,
all
but
two
parcels
in
this
12-mile
stretch
had
been
acquired.
since
that
time,
all
has
been
acquired.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir
and
construction
in
various
segments
on
each
side.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
clearing
or
construction,
your
honor,
prior
to
the
passage
of,
or
prior
to
this
case,
and
occurred
in
this
general
area
within,
i
would
estimate
within
half-mile
or
less
or
the
park
on
each
side.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir,
at
the
time
this
case
was
filed,
there
were
one
or
only
two
minor
easements
out
of
some
1700
parcels,
the
park
being
one
that
has
not
been
acquired.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
estimate
that
at
time
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record
from
either
side.
i
would
estimate
based
on
personal
experience
that
i
would
say
two-thirds
to
three-fourths
had
been
acquired
by
1968.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
think
the
act
applies,
your
honor,
in
this
situation
only
to
the
question
of
whether
all
possible
half
of
the
things
have
been
done
to
minimize
harm
of
the
park.
i
think
the
route
question
was
settled
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir
i
agree
with
that.
i
just
don't
think
this
particular
act
applies
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
i
think
it
only
applies
to
the
secretary
of
transportation.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
do.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
your
honor,
that
it
affects
whether
or
not
the
secretary
can
grant
federal
aid.
i
don't
think
it
affects
the
state's
right
to
build
a
highway
which
it
feels
it
needs
through
a
park
without
federal
aid.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
you
mean
the
entire
i-40?
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
agree
with
--
i
would
say
that
there
would
not
be
--
the
point
is
your
honor
that
it's
done
and
approved
in
sections.
the
state
never
knows
until
it's
completed
whether
or
not
the
federal
aid
will
be
forthcoming.
it's
more
in
a
nature
of
a
unilateral
contract
which
the
federal
government
says,
if
you
build
this
road
in
a
certain
way,
we
will
pay
our
portion.
there
is
no
requirement
that
state
build
it,
the
federal
government
cannot
make
them
build
it
and
when
i
get
through,
they
may
say
you
haven't
complied
with
our
standards,
we
won't
pay.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
that's
correct.
that's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
the
statement
should
then
have
the
right
to,
excuse
me
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
to
re-evaluate
its
position
it
may
wish
to
decide
to
do
that,
anyway,
it's
always
been
the
state's
position
even
before
the
road
has
reached
the
end
and
that
was
the
only
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
for
the
city
of
memphis,
it's
patterns
and
it's
for
various
other
things
that
should
be
considered
in
the
building
of
this
road.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
this
is
east.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
the
width
of
the
city
at
this
point.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
estimate,
your
honor,
that
that's
about
four
to
five
miles
of
the
center
of
the
city.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
the
only
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
on
three
sides
of
the
park,
where
i
am
pointing
our
three
of
the
largest
through
fares
in
the
city,
which
of
course
handle
great
body
of
traffic.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
they
are
already
there.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no,
sir
and
of
course,
the
point
is
that
it
would
affect
i
am
sure
engineering
wise,
the
use
of
the
express
way
if
you
did
away
with
some
other
major
thorough
fare
and
building
of
which
just
being
canceling
out
what
you
are
doing.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
i
don't
think
you
would
take
any
longer
to
construct.
the
problem
is
that
all
of
these
people
are
already
moved
and
the
houses
are
already
torn
down
and
the
state
owns
all
of
these
right-of-way.
the
only
other
point
that
we
wished
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
is
that
in
the
event
that
this
court
does
feel
that
a
stay
is
proper,
we
do
feel,
the
state
feels
that
it
is
a
proper
case
for
some
security.
we
realize
of
course,
that
security
is
a
matter
of
discretion
with
this
court,
but
the
state
has
been
stayed
off
and
on
in
this
matter
for
over
a
year.
they
originally
had
a
letting
plan
last
november
1969,
and
because
of
a
stay
order
issued
by
the
district
court,
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
do
anything
until
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
released
the
injunction.
at
that
time,
the
state
did
move
ahead
properly,
in
view
of
fact
that
this
road
has
been
in
progress
for
all
most
15
years
and
did
let
a
contract.
we
gave
that
information
to
the
court,
so
the
court
could
see
how
rising
costs
have
affected
the
state.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
arguments
presented
that
it
would
hurt
the
petitioners
or
deny
them
any
rights.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
we
do
not
object
to
job,
your
honor.
i
would
feel
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
we
should
have
been
given
the
opportunity
to
file
some
possible
additional
briefs
within
a
very
short
period
of
time,
if
the
court
chose
to
do
that
since
we
did
not
cover
all
of
those
issues
at
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
your
honor
naturally
the
delay
is
something
that
we
have
been
fighting,
or
that
i
have
been
fighting
for
some
time
and
we
do
want
to
expedite
it,
although
we
do
feel
that
the
state
is
entitled
and
the
commissioner
too,
i
mean,
it
could
be
damaged
heavily
without
security.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
think
they
should
post
a
bond,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
would
estimate,
again
your
honor
this
is
based
on
knowledge
that
i
am
not
fully
aware
of
it
on
times,
how
long
it
would
take
but
i
would
estimate
a
bond
for
â€“
in
the
neighborhood
of
$250,000
to
$500,000
would
be
sufficient
rather
than
a
multi-million
dollar
bond
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
seems
to
think,
we
are
required.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
we
will
suffer,
as
we
already
have
in
the
past
year,
the
bid,
proposed
bid
by
the
same
low
bidder
a
year
ago
was
$613,000
less
than
it
is
today.
so,
in
the
last
year,
cost
for
building
this
identical
engineering
design
have
risen
$613,000.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
don't
know
what
the
state
can
do
with
it,
your
honor.
the
city
has
already
spend
most
of
the
money.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
we
might
--
hate
to
be
factious,
but
i
don't
know
what
the
city
could
do
with
this
26
acre
strip
in
the
park.
i
am
sure
we
couldn't
get
the
money
back
in
the
city.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
well,
the
approaches
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
the
houses
are
gone.
they
have
all
been,
they
have
dead
land
that
has
been
leveled
and
is
ready
for
construction.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir.
he
is
the
low
bidder,
who
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
--
was
awarded
the
contract.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no
government
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
yes
sir,
i
think
the
bond
should
run
to
both
and
i
think
both
parties
need
be
protected,
not
just
the
state.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
of
course,
we
have
no
guarantee
your
honor
that
when
it's
over
with
that
for
some
other
reason
they
may
deny
federal
aid.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
we
have
no
reason
to
know
at
this
time
when
the
road
is
completed
even
though
this
way
that
for
some
other
reasons,
the
department
may
say,
we
are
not
going
to
pay
federal
aid
and
they
may
feel
that
we
have
not
handled
something
else
in
a
proper
manner,
which
often
happens.
they
have
that
right
to
withhold
the
aid
until
the
state
has
completed
the
project
and
expended
their
funds
and
shown
the
department
that
they
have
done
everything
according
to
the
requirements.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
think
that
congress
rightly
so
has
required
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
secretary
to
be
very
careful
before
a
road
is
put
through
parks
and
that
should
not
be
done
except
frankly
the
situation
of
this
nature
where
the
damage
to
the
park
is
rather
(inaudible)
and
no
facility
whatsoever
of
this
park
will
be
hampered.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
i
agree.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
and
i
agree
your
honor
that
this
will
still
be
a
park
just
as
it
is
when
this
road
is
completed.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
slightly
smaller
park.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
slightly
smaller
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
the
city
of
memphis
maintains
a
non-access
concrete
diesel
bus
route
which
around
roughly
your
honor
in
the
center
of
where
this
right-of-way
is
now
going.
it's
the
pavement
itself
is
25
to
30
feet
wide
and
has
a
clear
right-of-way
of
say
40
to
50
feet
wide.
and
the
route
purposes
to
stay
on
that,
that's
the
reason
that
this
job
was
made
instead
of
coming
straight
across
in
the
first
place,
was
to
stay
on
the
natural
separation
that
the
park
has
always
had,
and
to
avoid
any
damage
to
the
park
property.
that's
the
very
reason
it's
designed
to
follow
this
slightly
raised
route
as
it
came
toward
the
park,
to
stay
with
that
historical
division.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
not
at
this
time
attempt
to
restate
the
facts
or
using
time
for
that
purpose,
since
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
them
quite
well
to
the
court.
i've
being
the
only
attorney
at
the
bar
today
who
has
played
in
this
park.
i
do
feel
that
i
probably
know
more
the
details
than
either
of
my
colleagues.
i
would
be
of
course
happy
to
answer
questions
in
that
vein
but
i
will
pass
from
the
facts
to
take
up
what
i
feel
are
the
issues
that
affects
this
case,
and
affect
my
client,
the
state
of
tennessee.
i
think
the
best
place
to
start
any
argument
is
at
the
beginning
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court,
if
i
went
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
case,
as
it
will
help
you
to
understand
all
five
issues
in
this
case.
and
the
beginning
of
this
case
is
the
beginning
of
any
case
is
the
pleadings
and
the
complaint
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
sets
up
the
case,
it
sets
up
the
standard
of
judicial
review
and
it
sets
up
what
type
of
judicial
review
should
be
had
in
this
case.
in
the
petitioners'
original
complaint,
they
charge
that
the
secretary
didn't
make
findings,
that
is
really
the
only
basic
issue
in
the
lawsuit.
actually,
although,
i
was
glad
to
see
this
morning
the
affidavits
are
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
of
course,
the
other
affidavits
in
the
record
as
to
approval
of
the
route
and
reaffirmation
actually
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
before
this
court,
none
of
those
affidavits
were
actually
necessary.
the
complaint
filed
by
mr.
vardaman
states
all
of
the
necessary
facts
for
this
determination.
he
states
that
secretary
boyd
approved
the
route
and
of
course,
the
word
approved
is
the
keyword
in
the
statute.
there
is
no
dispute
concerning
the
approval.
there
is
no
dispute
concerning
the
final
approval
of
the
route
design
in
november
1969.
since
the
complaint
filed
by
the
petitioner
states
all
of
those
facts,
and
therefore
they
admit
it.
he
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
findings
as
such
were
required
under
the
parkland
statute
and
in
the
record,
in
the
appendix,
you'll
see
as
cited
in
our
brief,
the
colloquy
that
it
occurred
between
mr.
vardaman
and
district
judge
brown
on
this
very
point,
as
to
what
the
issues
were
and
what
he
was
contending.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
specific
findings
are
necessary
under
the
act
and
that
is,
of
course,
i
think
the
main
problem
that
this
court
has
to
face.
if
this
court
believes
as
i
do,
and
as
the
solicitor
general
does
that
this
is
a
discretionary
statute
that
congress
gave
the
secretary
of
transportation,
a
discretion
to
make
this
decision
and
that
findings
as
such
or
not
require
by
the
statute
or
by
either
the
application
or
non-application
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
feel
i
have
discuss
quite
fully
in
our
brief
that
it
does
not
apply
to
discretionary
decision
of
this
type,
that
the
court
can
reach
its
conclusion
and
end
this
case
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
point
alone.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
as
contrasted
mr.
justice
black
to
a
ministerial
duty.
he
has
to
exercise
judge,
he
has
to
exercise
his
judgment
rather
than
the
judgment
of
mr.
vardaman
or
the
solicitor
general
or
myself
or
any
of
the
protagonist
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
no,
sir.
i
will
take
that
point
right
now.
i
tend
to
agree
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
solicitor
general,
although
we
do
disagree
on
one
or
two
other
points
in
this
case,
regarding
administrative
record,
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
apply,
but
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
does
or
not,
the
result
in
the
case
is
the
same.
now
the
question
of
review,
as
i
stated
earlier
the
complaint
filed
about
mr.
vardaman
does
not
charge
secretary
volpe
with
any
misconduct.
it's
always
been
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
when
you
challenge
the
actions
of
an
administrator
and
you
want
to
have
a
review
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
arbitrary
or
capricious,
you
must
allege
some
fact
to
bring
it
before
the
court
to
have
a
trial
on
the
merits
which
is
what
mr.
vardaman
ultimately
wants.
they
didn't
say,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
didn't
even
make
a
conclusory
allegation
that
secretary
volpe
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
they
just
said
he
didn't
make
any
findings.
now
this
court
holds
the
findings
he
must
make,
that's
the
end
of
that
issue.
if
the
court
holds
that
findings
he
need
not
make,
that
again
is
a
dispositive
to
the
issue.
now
it's
not
that
he
is
precluded
from
judicial
review
or
this
court
is
precluded
from
reviewing
case.
it's
because
he
did
not
allege
facts
that
warrant
judicial
review
beyond
what
he
has
here
today.
if
he
had
said
that
secretary
volpe
laid
this
route
out
because
he
had
a
relative
nearby
who'd
profit
from
the
sale
of
his
land
or
the
enhancement
of
its
value
or
that
he
deliberately
refused
to
consider
evidence
or
that
he
deliberately
chose
engineers
to
advise
him
and
whom
he
knew
were
not
properly
trained,
that
maybe
the
basis
for
a
review
beyond
the
sculpt
that
we
have
here
on
the
question
of
summary
judgment,
but
he
did
not.
he
just
simply
said,
he
made
no
findings
although
he
admittedly
admits
that
he
approved
the
route.
now
going
from
that,
there
are
many
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
to
the
effect
that
with
those
allegations,
you
can
go
farther
and
you
can
question
the
secretary.
i
would
think
that
if
he
had
charged
secretary
volpe
with
some
improper
conduct,
he
would
have
a
prefect
right
to
examine
him
on
that
point.
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
he
just
didn't
allege
any
--
mr.
j.
alan
hanover
he
only
alleged,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
these
various
routes
have
been
approved,
the
designs
have
been
approved
and
that
the
secretary
has
failed
to
make
findings.
now,
we've
quoted
that
extensively
in
our
brief
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
in
conclusion
i
again
ask
the
court
to,
before
determining
the
standard
of
judicial
review
or
the
question
of
whether
the
secretary
or
federal
administrator
bridwell
should
have
been
opposed,
to
carefully
examine
the
pleadings
to
determine
what
the
issues
are.
i
think
all
of
the
other
issues
fall
into
place,
after
you
see
what
the
petitioners
are
actually
claiming
in
this
case.
