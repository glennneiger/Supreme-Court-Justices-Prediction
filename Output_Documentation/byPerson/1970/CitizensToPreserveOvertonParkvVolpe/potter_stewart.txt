justice
potter
stewart
when
is
the
latest
date
for
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
corporate
with
any
expedited
schedule
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
might
be
a
suggested.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
the
papers
last
week,
the
plans
are
to
depress
the
highway
except
where
it
crosses
the
stream.
justice
potter
stewart
where
they
say
it
has
cross
a
grade
in
order
to
eliminate
drainage
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
east-west
highway,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
east-west
and
the
park
lies
in
the
westward
part
of
memphis.
justice
potter
stewart
western
memphis
is
the
mississippi
river.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
where
the
zoo
is.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
factor
that
would
be
a
legitimate
one
under
the
rules
of
our
court
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
petition
for
certiorari,
would
you
agree
with
that,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
now
this
statute
was
rather
recently
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
amended
in
1968
or
1969,
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
now
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record,
that
this
basic
decision
was
made
back
in
the
1950s.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
that's
true
then
i
suppose
the
statute
wouldn't
be
applicable
at
all,
would
it
be?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
this
property
now
does
belong
to
the
state
it's
been
conveyed
by
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
this
acreage?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
city
has
already
expanded
half
of
the
proceeds
more
or
less
or
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
for
considerably
more
acreage
for
a
public
golf
course
and
has
another
substantial
amount
of
the
proceeds
which
is
explicitly
earmarked
under
local
law
for
the
acquisition
of
park
property?
justice
potter
stewart
well
so
you'll
end
up
with
substantially
increased
park
acreage?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
it
may
be
the
park
that
you
might
submit
in
the
wrong
place?
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is
that
if
we
can
confidently
predict,
that
certiorari
would
not
be
granted
in
this
case,
even
though
majority
of
the
court
might
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong,
but
if
we
can
confidently
predict
that
certiorari
would
not
be
granted
then
we
must
vacate
the
stay
or
a
temporary
stay
and
not
grant
a
permanent
stay,
even
though
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
might
be
wrong.
does
it
follow,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
we
simply
going
to
deny
certiorari
than
that's
–
we're
going
to
–
it
follows
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
going
to
be
left
undisturbed
even
though
wrong,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
arises
only
if
as
and
when
we've
granted
certiorari,
isn't
it
true?
justice
potter
stewart
only
if
certiorari
is
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
now
is
the
likelihood
of
granting
certiorari,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
nowhere
can
i
find
and
may
be
just
i
didn't
look
right,but
nowhere
have
i
found
so
far
any
statement
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
whether
in
a
press
release
or
otherwise,
that
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
to
routing
the
highways
through
the
park.
have
i
just
not
looked
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
press
release
on
which
you
relied
on
as
i
understand
it
for
the
finding,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
doesn't
quite
add
up
to
the
statutory
language,
does
it?
they
approved
it
as
the
feasible
and
prudent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
not
a
finding,
that
there
is
no
alternative
feasible
and
prudent
route,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
accepted,
their
low
bid
has
been
accepted.
justice
potter
stewart
contact
has
been
let,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
last
month,
it
went
ahead
very,
very
rapidly
as
i
read
the
records.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
was
last
month
that
the
contact
was
let,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
90%
federal?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
you
lose
this
case?
would
you
say
that
the
federal
government
would
only
be
prevented
from
contributing
to
the
construction
of
the
highways
through
the
park?
justice
potter
stewart
just
through
the
park?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
relying
of
mr.
j
b
michael
junior?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
the
low
bidder
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
the
moment
we
are
two
steps
prior
to
the
--
be
decided
on
the
merits.
we
have
before
us
now
an
application
for
a
stay
pending.
justice
potter
stewart
the
filing
of
an
action
upon
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
granting
for
a
petition
for
certiorari
is
not
yet
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
comes
only
if
as
a
when
such
petition
would
be
granted
now
and
your
answer
to
my
brother
harlan's
question
you
concede
that
you
would
be
willing
to
telescope
the
whole
business
and
assume
that
certiorari
has
granted
in
this
case,
and
have
–
the
merits
of
the
case
be
decided
on
what's
been
filed
so
far?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
me
is
what's
the
state
paid
to
city?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
reimbursement
of
90%
from
the
federal
government?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
controversy
surrounding
it
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
you
would
say
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
black
that
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
the
summary
judgment
is
set
aside,
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court,
that
then
it
will
be
up
to
the
district
court
to
consider
and
weigh
the
merits
of
the
various
alternative
routes?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
secretary
complied
with
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
up
to
the
district
court
surely
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
giles
against
maryland?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
a
big
aspect
that
bears
very
directly
on
this
point.
justice
potter
stewart
he
testified
to
the
administrator
record,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
(inaudible)
my
brother
harlan's
question.
you
have
findings
and
an
administrative
record,
you'd
see,
whether
or
not
the
findings
were
supported
by
the
administrative
record.
that
the
test
i
know,
of
review
is
something
that's
in
controversy
in
this
case,
but
in
any
event
that's
the
way
you
would
approach
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
answer
suggests
to
me
that
you
consider
this
adversary
action
an
almost
a
full
scale
lawsuit
between
you
and
your
group,
your
client
on
the
one
hand
and
the
secretary
on
the
other,
is
that
the
way
you
visualize
this
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
why,
why?
what
gives
your
client
standing
to
become
an
adversary
in
a
litigation
between
--
with
the
secretary
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
question
is
standing
to
do
what?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
public
hearing
in
the
memphis
city
council?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
your
people
were
heard
from,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
from
east
to
west
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
direction
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
acreage
is
more
important
but
even
more
important
in
parks,
with
respect
to
parks
is
their
locations,
one
of
the
few
things
perhaps
i
learned
as
a
member
of
the
city
council
of
cincinnati
that
where
the
parks
are
is
of
the
greatest
importance?
justice
potter
stewart
accessibility
to
the
people
who
need
the
park
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
a
climax
forest,
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
potter
stewart
i
heard
about
it
in
the
petitioners'
brief
and
i
perhaps
will
look
it
up
in
the
dictionary
but
i
just
wondered
if
you
knew
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
400
--
the
outer
edge
of
the
450
feet
are
not
paved?
justice
potter
stewart
it
really
hasn't
got
much
to
do
with
the
case,
but
i
think
you
find
that
the
450
feet
of
the
entire
right-of-way
doesn't
extent
nearly
to
the
edge?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
mr.
vardaman
you
don't
question
that
these
are
the
signatures
of
secretary
volpe
or
boyd,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
rights
are
proper
and
so
on.
these
are
genuine.
justice
potter
stewart
when
is
the
latest
date
for
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
corporate
with
any
expedited
schedule
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
might
be
a

justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
the
papers
last

the

justice
potter
stewart
where
they

justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
east-west
highway,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
east-west
and
the
park
lies
in
the
westward
part
of
memphis.
justice
potter
stewart
western
memphis
is
the
mississippi
river.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
where
the
zoo
is.
justice
potter
stewart
that

that

justice

alright.
justice

this

now
does

it's
been

justice
potter
stewart

so
you'll

secretary
on
the
other,
is
that
the
way
you
visualize
this
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
why,
why?
what
gives
your
client
standing
to
become
an
adversary
in
a
litigation
between
--
with
the
secretary
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
question
is
standing
to
do
what?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
public
hearing
in
the
memphis
city
council?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
your
people
were
heard
from,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
from
east
to
west
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
direction
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
acreage
is
more
important
but
even
more
important
in
parks,
with
respect
to
parks
is
their
locations,
one
of
the
few
things
perhaps
i
learned
as
a
member
of
the
city
council
of
cincinnati
that
where
the
parks
are
is
of
the
greatest
importance?
justice
potter
stewart
accessibility
to
the
people
who
need
the
park
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
a
climax
forest,
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
potter
stewart
i
heard
about
it
in
the
petitioners'
brief
and
i
perhaps
will
look
it
up
in
the
dictionary
but
i
just
wondered
if
you
knew
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
400
--
the
outer
edge
of
the
450
feet
are
not
paved?
justice
potter
stewart
it
really
hasn't
got
much
to
do
with
the
case,
but
i
think
you
find
that
the
450
feet
of
the
entire
right-of-way
doesn't
extent
nearly
to
the
edge?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
mr.
vardaman
you
don't
question
that
these
are
the
signatures
of
secretary
volpe
or
boyd,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
rights
are
proper
and
so
on.
these
are
genuine.
