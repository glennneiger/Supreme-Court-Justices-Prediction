right-of-way?
chief
justice
warren
e.

do
you
think
this
process,
this
hypothetical
process,
is
complicated
for
the
fact
what
the
secretary
who
made
these
decision
is
no
longer
the
secretary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress

the
statement,

two
statements

their
--
chief

i
am
not
quite
sure
mr.

in
response
to
the
questions
and
so
i
would
like
to
try
again
on
this
matter
of
cross
examination
of
the

if
he
had
made
the
findings,
and

a
little
bit
