mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
the
same
one
that
was
here
before
and
while
it's
coming,
i
will
refer
to
the
facts
of
the
case
to
which
mr.
vardaman
has
not
made
much
reference
this
morning.
the
park
which
is
involved
here,
overton
park
in
memphis,
is
about
8
tenths
of
a
mile
across.
one
place
in
the
record,
it
says
4800
feet,
another
place
it
seems
to
indicate
it's
4100
feet
and
i
take
an
intermediate
place
and
call
it
8
tenths
of
a
mile.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
from
east
to
west.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
is
the
direction
that
the
highway
comes.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
location
of
the
road
through
the
park
was
approved
by
the
bureau
of
public
roads
in
1956,
15
years
ago
now.
it
is
true
as
mr.
vardaman
says
that
at
later
times,
there
have
been
suggestion
that
it
might
be
subject
to
reconsideration,
but
that
would
be
like
a
petition
for
rehearing,
that
does
not
negative
the
fact
that
it
was
approved
in
1956.
it
was
reaffirmed
by
federal
highway
administrator,
whitton
in
january
1966,
five
years
ago
and
both
of
these
were
before
there
was
any
statutory
provisions
with
respect
to
parks.
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act
was
enacted
in
october
1966
and
effective
april
1,
1967.
the
approval
of
the
route
was
reconfirmed
by
the
department
of
the
transportation
secretary,
boyd
on
april
1968.
the
section
4
(f)
was
amended
and
section
138
of
the
federal
aid
highway
act
was
enacted
and
effective
in
august
1968
and
the
design,
only
the
design,
because
secretary
volpe
gave
no
consideration
to
the
location,
that
had
been
determined
in
1956,
1966
and
reconfirmed
by
secretary
boyd
in
1968,
the
design
was
approved
by
secretary
volpe
on
november
5,
1969.
i
would
like
to
recall
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
that
and
i
quote,
“to
the
greatest
extend
possible”
the
state
shall
select
the
route
for
highways
and
this
route
has
been
approved
by
the
state,
the
city
and
by
the
memphis
park
board.
the
tennessee
highway
department
was
authorized
to
proceed
with
the
purchase
of
the
right-of-way
on
may
29,
1967
nearly
four
years
ago,
and
commenced
doing
so,
and
the
area
is
not
immediately
adjacent
to
the
park.
at
the
present
time
and
this
is
true
with
one
or
two
exceptions
that
at
the
time
the
suit
was
started,
all
of
the
land
has
been
acquired
to
and
through
the
park.
99%
of
the
nearly
2,000
people
living
their
had
been
displaced
and
75%
of
the
buildings
had
been
demolished.
some
of
the
land
has
been
(inaudible)
now
the
red
line
east
to
west
is
the
approved
route
of
the
park.
that
which
has
the
green
dash
lines
beside
it
is
land
where
the
right-of-way
was
cleared
prior
to
april
1968,
the
date
of
secretary
boyd's
approval.
all
of
this
was
cleared
by
august
1966,
before
the
effective
date
of
either
the
statutes
involved
here.
the
land
with
a
yellow
along
the
red
is
land
which
was
cleared
after
april
1968,
after
the
date
of
secretary
boyd's
approval.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
park
is
this
area
mr.
justice
from
there
to
there,
and
that
is
all
that
we
are
concerned
with
here.
what
i
am
trying
to
point
out
is
that
the
land
up
to
the
park
on
both
sides
was
cleared
after
april
1968,
and
substantially
all
cleared
by
january
1969
when
secretary
volpe
took
office,
and
all
cleared
by
november
1969,
when
he
approved
the
design.
now
here
it
is,
one
of
the
alternate
which
was
considered,
here
is
another
alternate
that
was
considered,
this
triangular
line
is
an
alternate
which
is
suggested
in
one
of
the
affidavits
that's
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
this
is
a
pedestrian
bridge
for
access
to
the
zoo.
this
also
is
a
pedestrian
bridge
with
access
to
the
zoo,
and
this
is
a
cross
street,
which
is
left
open.
the
state
has
bought
the
26
acres
through
the
park,
for
$2,200,000,
and
the
city
has
already
expended
$1,000,000
for
160
acre
park
with
a
golf
course,
and
it
spent
$200,000
on
improvements
to
the
zoo,
and
is
obligated
to
expend
the
remaining
million
dollars
for
additional
parkland.
and
thus
the
park
resources
of
memphis
will
be
increased
by
some
320
acres
on
account
of
the
loss
of
26
acres
in
overton
park.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
mr.
justice,
and
i
am
little
bit
inhibited
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
where
the
parks
are.
i
had
made
inquiries
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
the
park
has
substantial
improvement
to
the
park
facilities
of
memphis
in
terms
of
location
as
well
as
area.
but
i
can't
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
so
advised
and
perhaps
and
mr.
hanover
can
tell
you
more
about
that.
the
location
of
the
new
park
does
not
appeared
in
the
record.
our
brief
answers
the
arguments
made
by
the
petitioners
and
i
believe
that
we
have
an
argument
and
answer
to
each
argument.
we
rely
on
that
brief.
in
the
brief
time
available
to
me
for
oral
argument,
i
cannot
deal
with
all
of
the
arguments
here,
but
i
will
confine
my
consideration
to
four
points.
there
are
special
circumstances
here,
which
makes
this
a
suitable
place
to
put
this
role
and
which
support
the
determination
of
the
secretary
that
there
is
no
other
'feasible
and
prudent'
and
i
emphasis
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
'and
prudent'
alternative
to
this
route.
overton
park
has
always
been
divided.
there
is
in
fact
the
park
and
the
zoo,
and
for
75
years
or
so
they
have
been
separated.
this
is
the
zoo.
the
zoo
has
been
extended
into
this
area
and
this
although
it
appears
to
be
trees,
is
trees
has
parking
space
under
it.
the
park
is
south
of
the
road.
at
first
there
was
a
narrow
gauge
railway
across
the
land
at
this
point,
then
trolley
tracks,
and
for
the
past
30
years
or
so
the
trolley
tracks
have
been
replaced
by
a
paved
bus
route.
this
right-of-way
is
40
or
50
feet
wide
and
it
has
city
bus
traffic
with
no
protection,
and
that
is
been
there
for
60
or
70
years
in
one
form
or
another.
there
is
however
and
always
has
been
limited
access
to
the
zoo,
and
that's
what
they
want.
along
the
bus
route
at
the
south
side
of
the
zoo
there
is
a
chain
link
fence
6
or
7
feet
high,
except
at
the
east
end
where
the
parking
lot
for
the
zoo
is
located
and
will
continue
to
be
located.
the
bus
route
already
occupies
4
or
5
acres
which
of
course
has
no
trees
on
it.
so
we
are
talking
about
21
or
22
acres.
the
park
now
contains
150
acres
of
unimproved
woodland.
it
can
be
seen
here
at
the
lake
so
that
the
statement
made
in
one
of
the
letters
in
the
record
and
relied
on
in
the
petitioners'
brief
that
there
won't
be
much
in
the
way
of
wooded
park
left
in
overton
park
after
an
interstate
highway
is
routed
through
it
is
obviously
a
greatly
over
exaggerated
statement.
there
will
be
at
least
130
acres
of
wooded
parkland
left
in
overton
park.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
i
have
some
recollection
that
i
read
about
it
once
many
years
ago,
but
i
can't
tell
you
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
perhaps
the
petitioners
enlighten
you.
i
should
have
looked
into
it.
it
is
a
tree
term,
but
i
don't
know
it.
with
respect
to
the
design
much
of
the
highways
to
be
depressed
so
as
to
minimize
the
noise
and
interference
with
view.
secretary
volpe
took
great
pains
with
respect
to
that.
the
place
for
the
highway
will
be
above
grade
to
enable
it
to
cross
on
(inaudible),
where
engineering
difficulty
would
be
considerable
and
continuing,
if
the
highway
were
depressed.
the
statute
doesn't
say,
no
other
possible
alternative.
it
does
not
even
say
no
other
feasible
alternative.
what
it
says
is
no
other
'feasible
and
prudent'
alternative
in
the
conjunctive.
there
must
be
no
other
route
that
is
prudent
as
well
as
feasible.
according
to
my
dictionary,
prudent
means
wise
in
handling
practical
matters,
exercising
good
judgment
or
common
sense.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
was
intended
that
the
secretary
should
make
this
judgment.
we
submit
that
it
is
cleared
on
this
record
that
both
secretaries
had
adequate
support
for
their
conclusion.
that
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
to
the
use
of
this
land
and
that
all
possible
planing
to
minimize
harm
to
the
park
has
been
done.
now
i
turn
to
the
question
of
findings.
the
statute
doesn't
require
findings
or
a
trial-type
hearing
by
the
secretary,
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
for
this
court
to
conclude
we
respectfully
submit
that
findings
by
the
secretary
are
required
or
that
he
should
be
required
to
conduct
a
trail-type
hearing.
following
a
suggestion
which
was
made
in
the
previous
oral
argument
in
this
case,
we
have
obtained
from
both
secretaries
involved
certificates,
stating
their
findings.
now
these
are
referred
to
by
mr.
vardaman,
understandably
as
affidavits,
but
they
are
not
so
denominated
themselves.
they
are
certificates
made
by
a
high
government
officer
with
respect
to
actions
which
they
took
and
they
do
we
submit
serve
to
clarify
any
ambiguity
which
may
lie
in
the
record
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
did
not
make
formal
findings,
which
i
again
submit
the
statute
does
not
require
them
to
do.
we
recognize
that
the
presentation
of
these
documents
is
unusual.
we
submit
them
for
what
effect
they
can
properly
be
given.
i
repeat
the
suggestion
came
from
the
previous
oral
argument
in
the
court.
we
had
them
nicely
printed
up,
but
secretary
volpe
has
been
out
of
town.
his
affidavit
was
cleared
with
him
by
telephone.
it
was
to
be
signed
this
morning
and
when
he
came
to
sign
it,
he
wanted
to
change
and
of
course,
it's
his
certificate
and
so
he
changed
it,
and
the
result
is
that
we
have
withdrawn
the
printed
copies
which
we
had
prepared
in
advance
and
have
submitted
the
original
of
the
certificates
to
the
court
and
had
provided
the
xerox
copies
to
counsel
and
to
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
it
should
appear
in
some
appropriate
way
and
i
hope
that
these
certificates
are
shall
i
say,
last
resort
appropriate
way.
that
the
secretaries
did,
in
fact,
recognize
and
take
into
account
and
undertake
to
operate
under
the
statutory
requirement,
clearly
and
validly
made
by
congress.
we
think
that
even
without
these
formal
certificates
from
the
secretaries,
there
is
sufficient
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
did
proceed
on
that
basis.
but
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
program
or
project
involving
park
lands
unless
one,
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
to
the
use
of
such
land
and
two
such
program
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm
to
such
part
resulting
from
such
use.
it
does
not
even
say,
unless
the
secretary
finds
that
there
is
no
such
alternative
and
i
suspect
that,
that
was
because
congress
deliberately
wanted
to
avoid
the
secretary
having
to
hold
hearing
and
take
evidence
and
balance
the
evidence
and
then
in
the
way,
that
a
court
does
after
a
trial
type
hearing
make
a
finding
of
fact.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
the
legislative
history
is
detailed
both
in
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief
and
in
our
brief.
particularly,
on
page
21
there
are
statements
of
our
brief.
there
are
statements
in
the
report
of
the
senate
public
works
committee
and
in
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
public
works.
committee
is
extremely
concerned
that
the
highway
program
be
carried
out
in
such
a
manner
as
to
reduce
in
all
instances,
the
harsh
impact
on
people
which
results
from
the
dislocation
and
displacement
by
reason
of
highway
construction.
therefore,
the
use
of
park
lands
properly
protect
it
and
with
the
damage
minimized
by
the
most
sophisticated
construction
techniques
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
movement
of
large
numbers
of
people.
there
is
a
colloquy
in
the
senate
to
which
reference
is
made
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
which
he
seems
to
say,
at
least,
to
the
conclusion
that
the
secretary
has
no
discretion
but
which
we
read
in
exactly
the
opposite
way.
we
read
it
to
say
that
if
the
local
people
say
that
these
parks
can't
be
used,
then
the
secretary
has
no
discretion,
but
that
if
they
say
they
can
be
used,
it
still
remains
a
matter
for
the
secretary's
judgment
as
to
whether
there
is
a
feasible
and
prudent
alternative.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
the
department
is
upgrading
the
procedures
here
and
i
think
that's
sound,
but
i
know
off
no
reason
why
that
should
be
applied
retroactively
to
proceedings
which
were
already
filed
along
by
the
time
that
was
adopted
and
i
don't
read
the
thorpe
case
on
which
the
petitioners
rely
as
leading
to
any
such
conclusion.
the
question
here
is
whether
--
it
is
clear
here
that
here
that
both
secretaries
understood
the
requirement
of
the
statute
and
they've
now
both
certified,
but
they
did
understand
it
and
that
they
complied
with
it.
now
this
court
has
often
held
that
formal
finding
should
not
be
insisted
on,
when
they're
not
legislatively
commanded.
the
standard
of
review
should
be
whether
the
actions
of
the
secretaries
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we
think
that
the
petitioners
are
far
from
having
sustained
their
burden
of
proof,
that
there
was
such
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
here.
we
think
that
his
record
contains
ample
material
that
shows
that
both
secretaries
acted
carefully,
thoughtfully,
deliberately
and
was
full
awareness
of
their
obligation
under
the
statute,
but
it
was
their
decision
and
they
made
it.
the
task
was
one
of
great
responsibility
and
they
should
be
upheld.
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
apply
to
this,
because
it's
a
grant
making
matter
which
is
especially
excluded
from
the
act,
but
if
it
does
reply,
it
would
lead
to
the
same
result.
but
if
the
court
feels
that
the
question--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i'm
just
turning
to
that.
if
the
court
feels
that
the
question
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
cannot
be
determined
on
this
record,
and
we
felt
there
was
some
indication
of
that
in
the
previous
argument
then
we
rely
on
our
motion
to
remand
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
admission
of
the
administrative
record
in
the
district
court.
we
do
not
think
that
there
should
be
a
remand
for
a
full
trial,
unless
the
district
court
finds
after
examining
the
administrative
record,
that
it
cannot
decided
the
issue
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
without
a
further
a
trial.
we
filed
the
motion
of
remand
not
for
the
purpose
of
conceding
error
here
as
mr.
vardaman
says,
but
for
the
purpose
of
narrowing
the
scope
of
any
remand,
and
for
the
purpose
of
negativing
any
suggestion,
that
there
should
not
be
such
a
limited
remand
because
we
have
not
asked
for
such
a
limitation.
now
the
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
virtually
expired.
i
will
have
to
summarize
my
remaining
points.
the
third
one
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
a
remand
here,
would
it
seems
to
me
be
a
triumph
for
formalism.
with
the
benefit
for
hindsight
this
record
is
not
all
that
i
might
like
to
have.
it
would
be
nicer,
if
the
secretaries
had
made
formal
findings
at
the
time
they
made
their
determinations,
though
they
have
made
such
a
findings
nows.
it
would
be
better,
if
we
didn't
have
to
piece
out
the
essence
of
their
determinations
from
other
actions
which
they
took
like
press
releases
and
resolutions
and
letters
and
affidavits.
and
it
was
for
this
reason,
that
we
moved
for
the
introduction
of
the
remand,
or
the
introduction
of
the
administrative
record,
but
is
this
not
really
an
exercise
in
futility.
would
it
not
be
a
triumph
of
formalism
over
substance
or
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
it's
well
known
words,
a
case
of
marching
the
king's
men
up
the
hill
and
then
marching
them
down
again.
and
remand
for
further
proceedings,
would
i
think
be
a
kind
of
mechanical
jurisprudence
more
of
fitting
for
barren
park
than
for
the
final
third
the
20th
century.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
my
point
is
that
i
think
that
there
is
ample
and
adequate
in
the
record
now
to
make
it
plain,
that
if
this
is
remanded,
it
will
great
deal
of
motion
will
be
generated
and
when
you
get
through
the
motion,
there
will
then
be
a
nice
new
record
which
will
have
adequate
material
to
show
that
the
route
is
not
--
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
think
that
there
isn't.
if
this
test
of
review
is
whether
the
secretary
acted
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
which
we
think
is
the
test,
we
think
it
is
a
apparent
from
this
record
that
neither
secretary
acted
in
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
manner,
ignoring
their
requirements
of
the
statue.
if
that
does
not
adequately
appear,
then
we
think
the
case
should
be
remanded
so
that
the
administrative
record
can
be
seen
by
the
district
court
and
that
question
determined
on
the
administrative
record.
what
we
think
should
not
be
done
here,
is
anything
which
requires
a
trail
type
hearing
before
the
secretary
or
anything
which
leads
to,
what
amounts
to
a
trial
de
novo
before
a
district
court
and
a
decision
of
this
question
in
effect
by
the
district
court
rather
than
by
the
secretary.
because
that
is
my
final
point,
a
fundamental
question
here,
one
of
the
separation
powers,
of
the
proper
allocation
of
the
function
that
courts,
legislatures
and
the
executive
branch
in
the
important
and
complex
task
of
carrying
on
government.
two
things
are
clear,
one
is
that
congress
is
legislated
certain
specific
requirements
with
respect
to
the
use
of
park
lands
and
the
other
is
that
it
is
allocated
the
administration
of
that
provision
to
the
executive
branch
specifically
to
the
secretary
of
transportation.
this
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
no
role
for
the
courts
where
the
secretary
should
be
held
and
check
if
he
ignores
the
legislative
requirements.
but
it
does
mean
that
the
proper
role
of
the
courts
is
now
unlimited
one
and
it
is
important
i
submit,
both
through
the
administration
of
the
government
and
for
the
courts,
that
the
limited
nature
of
that
role
be
recognized
and
observed.
it
is
not
good
government
to
have
all
governmental
decisions
decided
by
courts
or
even
that
have
a
situation
where
as
a
matter
of
routine,
all
questions
arising
in
the
administration
of
the
government
are
habitually
referred
to
courts.
in
recent
years,
more
and
more
governmental
decisions
are
being
made
by
courts.
the
recent
broadening
or
near
elimination
of
concepts
of
standing
and
the
limitations
on
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
have
contributed
to
this
result.
of
course,
court
should
see
that
the
constitution
is
complied
with
and
that
the
statutory
rules
are
followed,
but
is
it
wise
that
the
substance
of
all
administrative
actions
should
be
subject
to
reevaluation
in
the
courts.
what
the
two
secretaries
have
done
here,
they
have
acted,
what
they
have
done
is
rational,
and
it
complies
that
is
directives
given
to
them
by
congress.
the
decision
was
to
remand,
it
should
be
upheld.
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
afraid
i
have
trespassed
some
on
mr.
hanover's
time
and
i
hope
that
he
can
have
some
of
his
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
the
same
one
that
was
here
before
and
while
it's
coming,
i
will
refer
to
the
facts
of
the
case
to
which
mr.
vardaman
has
not
made
much
reference
this
morning.
the
park
which
is
involved
here,
overton
park
in
memphis,
is
about
8
tenths
of
a
mile
across.
one
place
in
the
record,
it
says
4800
feet,
another
place
it
seems
to
indicate
it's
4100
feet
and
i
take
an
intermediate
place
and
call
it
8
tenths
of
a
mile.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
from
east
to
west.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
is
the
direction
that
the
highway
comes.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
location
of
the
road
through
the
park
was
approved
by
the
bureau
of
public
roads
in
1956,
15
years
ago
now.
it
is
true
as
mr.
vardaman
says
that
at
later
times,
there
have
been
suggestion
that
it
might
be
subject
to
reconsideration,
but
that
would
be
like
a
petition
for
rehearing,
that
does
not
negative
the
fact
that
it
was
approved
in
1956.
it
was
reaffirmed
by
federal
highway
administrator,
whitton
in
january
1966,
five
years
ago
and
both
of
these
were
before
there
was
any
statutory
provisions
with
respect
to
parks.
section
4
(f)
of
the
department
of
transportation
act
was
enacted
in
october
1966
and
effective
april
1,
1967.
the
approval
of
the
route
was
reconfirmed
by
the
department
of
the
transportation
secretary,
boyd
on
april
1968.
the
section
4
(f)
was
amended
and
section
138
of
the
federal
aid
highway
act
was
enacted
and
effective
in
august
1968
and
the
design,
only
the
design,
because
secretary
volpe
gave
no
consideration
to
the
location,
that
had
been
determined
in
1956,
1966
and
reconfirmed
by
secretary
boyd
in
1968,
the
design
was
approved
by
secretary
volpe
on
november
5,
1969.
i
would
like
to
recall
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
that
and
i
quote,
“to
the
greatest
extend
possible”
the
state
shall
select
the
route
for
highways
and
this
route
has
been
approved
by
the
state,
the
city
and
by
the
memphis
park
board.
the
tennessee
highway
department
was
authorized
to
proceed
with
the
purchase
of
the
right-of-way
on
may
29,
1967
nearly
four
years
ago,
and
commenced
doing
so,
and
the
area
is
not
immediately
adjacent
to
the
park.
at
the
present
time
and
this
is
true
with
one
or
two
exceptions
that
at
the
time
the
suit
was
started,
all
of
the
land
has
been
acquired
to
and
through
the
park.
99%
of
the
nearly
2,000
people
living
their
had
been
displaced
and
75%
of
the
buildings
had
been
demolished.
some
of
the
land
has
been
(inaudible)
now
the
red
line
east
to
west
is
the
approved
route
of
the
park.
that
which
has
the
green
dash
lines
beside
it
is
land
where
the
right-of-way
was
cleared
prior
to
april
1968,
the
date
of
secretary
boyd's
approval.
all
of
this
was
cleared
by
august
1966,
before
the
effective
date
of
either
the
statutes
involved
here.
the
land
with
a
yellow
along
the
red
is
land
which
was
cleared
after
april
1968,
after
the
date
of
secretary
boyd's
approval.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
the
park
is
this
area
mr.
justice
from
there
to
there,
and
that
is
all
that
we
are
concerned
with
here.
what
i
am
trying
to
point
out
is
that
the
land
up
to
the
park
on
both
sides
was
cleared
after
april
1968,
and
substantially
all
cleared
by
january
1969
when
secretary
volpe
took
office,
and
all
cleared
by
november
1969,
when
he
approved
the
design.
now
here
it
is,
one
of
the
alternate
which
was
considered,
here
is
another
alternate
that
was
considered,
this
triangular
line
is
an
alternate
which
is
suggested
in
one
of
the
affidavits
that's
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
this
is
a
pedestrian
bridge
for
access
to
the
zoo.
this
also
is
a
pedestrian
bridge
with
access
to
the
zoo,
and
this
is
a
cross
street,
which
is
left
open.
the
state
has
bought
the
26
acres
through
the
park,
for
$2,200,000,
and
the
city
has
already
expended
$1,000,000
for
160
acre
park
with
a
golf
course,
and
it
spent
$200,000
on
improvements
to
the
zoo,
and
is
obligated
to
expend
the
remaining
million
dollars
for
additional
parkland.
and
thus
the
park
resources
of
memphis
will
be
increased
by
some
320
acres
on
account
of
the
loss
of
26
acres
in
overton
park.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
mr.
justice,
and
i
am
little
bit
inhibited
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
where
the
parks
are.
i
had
made
inquiries
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
the
park
has
substantial
improvement
to
the
park
facilities
of
memphis
in
terms
of
location
as
well
as
area.
but
i
can't
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
so
advised
and
perhaps
and
mr.
hanover
can
tell
you
more
about
that.
the
location
of
the
new
park
does
not
appeared
in
the
record.
our
brief
answers
the
arguments
made
by
the
petitioners
and
i
believe
that
we
have
an
argument
and
answer
to
each
argument.
we
rely
on
that
brief.
in
the
brief
time
available
to
me
for
oral
argument,
i
cannot
deal
with
all
of
the
arguments
here,
but
i
will
confine
my
consideration
to
four
points.
there
are
special
circumstances
here,
which
makes
this
a
suitable
place
to
put
this
role
and
which
support
the
determination
of
the
secretary
that
there
is
no
other
'feasible
and
prudent'
and
i
emphasis
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
'and
prudent'
alternative
to
this
route.
overton
park
has
always
been
divided.
there
is
in
fact
the
park
and
the
zoo,
and
for
75
years
or
so
they
have
been
separated.
this
is
the
zoo.
the
zoo
has
been
extended
into
this
area
and
this
although
it
appears
to
be
trees,
is
trees
has
parking
space
under
it.
the
park
is
south
of
the
road.
at
first
there
was
a
narrow
gauge
railway
across
the
land
at
this
point,
then
trolley
tracks,
and
for
the
past
30
years
or
so
the
trolley
tracks
have
been
replaced
by
a
paved
bus
route.
this
right-of-way
is
40
or
50
feet
wide
and
it
has
city
bus
traffic
with
no
protection,
and
that
is
been
there
for
60
or
70
years
in
one
form
or
another.
there
is
however
and
always
has
been
limited
access
to
the
zoo,
and
that's
what
they
want.
along
the
bus
route
at
the
south
side
of
the
zoo
there
is
a
chain
link
fence
6
or
7
feet
high,
except
at
the
east
end
where
the
parking
lot
for
the
zoo
is
located
and
will
continue
to
be
located.
the
bus
route
already
occupies
4
or
5
acres
which
of
course
has
no
trees
on
it.
so
we
are
talking
about
21
or
22
acres.
the
park
now
contains
150
acres
of
unimproved
woodland.
it
can
be
seen
here
at
the
lake
so
that
the
statement
made
in
one
of
the
letters
in
the
record
and
relied
on
in
the
petitioners'
brief
that
there
won't
be
much
in
the
way
of
wooded
park
left
in
overton
park
after
an
interstate
highway
is
routed
through
it
is
obviously
a
greatly
over
exaggerated
statement.
there
will
be
at
least
130
acres
of
wooded
parkland
left
in
overton
park.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
i
have
some
recollection
that
i
read
about
it
once
many
years
ago,
but
i
can't
tell
you
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
perhaps
the
petitioners
enlighten
you.
i
should
have
looked
into
it.
it
is
a
tree
term,
but
i
don't
know
it.
with
respect
to
the
design
much
of
the
highways
to
be
depressed
so
as
to
minimize
the
noise
and
interference
with
view.
secretary
volpe
took
great
pains
with
respect
to
that.
the
place
for
the
highway
will
be
above
grade
to
enable
it
to
cross
on
(inaudible),
where
engineering
difficulty
would
be
considerable
and
continuing,
if
the
highway
were
depressed.
the
statute
doesn't
say,
no
other
possible
alternative.
it
does
not
even
say
no
other
feasible
alternative.
what
it
says
is
no
other
'feasible
and
prudent'
alternative
in
the
conjunctive.
there
must
be
no
other
route
that
is
prudent
as
well
as
feasible.
according
to
my
dictionary,
prudent
means
wise
in
handling
practical
matters,
exercising
good
judgment
or
common
sense.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
was
intended
that
the
secretary
should
make
this
judgment.
we
submit
that
it
is
cleared
on
this
record
that
both
secretaries
had
adequate
support
for
their
conclusion.
that
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
to
the
use
of
this
land
and
that
all
possible
planing
to
minimize
harm
to
the
park
has
been
done.
now
i
turn
to
the
question
of
findings.
the
statute
doesn't
require
findings
or
a
trial-type
hearing
by
the
secretary,
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
for
this
court
to
conclude
we
respectfully
submit
that
findings
by
the
secretary
are
required
or
that
he
should
be
required
to
conduct
a
trail-type
hearing.
following
a
suggestion
which
was
made
in
the
previous
oral
argument
in
this
case,
we
have
obtained
from
both
secretaries
involved
certificates,
stating
their
findings.
now
these
are
referred
to
by
mr.
vardaman,
understandably
as
affidavits,
but
they
are
not
so
denominated
themselves.
they
are
certificates
made
by
a
high
government
officer
with
respect
to
actions
which
they
took
and
they
do
we
submit
serve
to
clarify
any
ambiguity
which
may
lie
in
the
record
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
did
not
make
formal
findings,
which
i
again
submit
the
statute
does
not
require
them
to
do.
we
recognize
that
the
presentation
of
these
documents
is
unusual.
we
submit
them
for
what
effect
they
can
properly
be
given.
i
repeat
the
suggestion
came
from
the
previous
oral
argument
in
the
court.
we
had
them
nicely
printed
up,
but
secretary
volpe
has
been
out
of
town.
his
affidavit
was
cleared
with
him
by
telephone.
it
was
to
be
signed
this
morning
and
when
he
came
to
sign
it,
he
wanted
to
change
and
of
course,
it's
his
certificate
and
so
he
changed
it,
and
the
result
is
that
we
have
withdrawn
the
printed
copies
which
we
had
prepared
in
advance
and
have
submitted
the
original
of
the
certificates
to
the
court
and
had
provided
the
xerox
copies
to
counsel
and
to
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
it
should
appear
in
some
appropriate
way
and
i
hope
that
these
certificates
are
shall
i
say,
last
resort
appropriate
way.
that
the
secretaries
did,
in
fact,
recognize
and
take
into
account
and
undertake
to
operate
under
the
statutory
requirement,
clearly
and
validly
made
by
congress.
we
think
that
even
without
these
formal
certificates
from
the
secretaries,
there
is
sufficient
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
did
proceed
on
that
basis.
but
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
secretary
shall
not
approve
any
program
or
project
involving
park
lands
unless
one,
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
alternative
to
the
use
of
such
land
and
two
such
program
includes
all
possible
planning
to
minimize
harm
to
such
part
resulting
from
such
use.
it
does
not
even
say,
unless
the
secretary
finds
that
there
is
no
such
alternative
and
i
suspect
that,
that
was
because
congress
deliberately
wanted
to
avoid
the
secretary
having
to
hold
hearing
and
take
evidence
and
balance
the
evidence
and
then
in
the
way,
that
a
court
does
after
a
trial
type
hearing
make
a
finding
of
fact.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
the
legislative
history
is
detailed
both
in
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief
and
in
our
brief.
particularly,
on
page
21
there
are
statements
of
our
brief.
there
are
statements
in
the
report
of
the
senate
public
works
committee
and
in
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
public
works.
committee
is
extremely
concerned
that
the
highway
program
be
carried
out
in
such
a
manner
as
to
reduce
in
all
instances,
the
harsh
impact
on
people
which
results
from
the
dislocation
and
displacement
by
reason
of
highway
construction.
therefore,
the
use
of
park
lands
properly
protect
it
and
with
the
damage
minimized
by
the
most
sophisticated
construction
techniques
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
movement
of
large
numbers
of
people.
there
is
a
colloquy
in
the
senate
to
which
reference
is
made
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
which
he
seems
to
say,
at
least,
to
the
conclusion
that
the
secretary
has
no
discretion
but
which
we
read
in
exactly
the
opposite
way.
we
read
it
to
say
that
if
the
local
people
say
that
these
parks
can't
be
used,
then
the
secretary
has
no
discretion,
but
that
if
they
say
they
can
be
used,
it
still
remains
a
matter
for
the
secretary's
judgment
as
to
whether
there
is
a
feasible
and
prudent
alternative.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
the
department
is
upgrading
the
procedures
here
and
i
think
that's
sound,
but
i
know
off
no
reason
why
that
should
be
applied
retroactively
to
proceedings
which
were
already
filed
along
by
the
time
that
was
adopted
and
i
don't
read
the
thorpe
case
on
which
the
petitioners
rely
as
leading
to
any
such
conclusion.
the
question
here
is
whether
--
it
is
clear
here
that
here
that
both
secretaries
understood
the
requirement
of
the
statute
and
they've
now
both
certified,
but
they
did
understand
it
and
that
they
complied
with
it.
now
this
court
has
often
held
that
formal
finding
should
not
be
insisted
on,
when
they're
not
legislatively
commanded.
the
standard
of
review
should
be
whether
the
actions
of
the
secretaries
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we
think
that
the
petitioners
are
far
from
having
sustained
their
burden
of
proof,
that
there
was
such
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
here.
we
think
that
his
record
contains
ample
material
that
shows
that
both
secretaries
acted
carefully,
thoughtfully,
deliberately
and
was
full
awareness
of
their
obligation
under
the
statute,
but
it
was
their
decision
and
they
made
it.
the
task
was
one
of
great
responsibility
and
they
should
be
upheld.
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
apply
to
this,
because
it's
a
grant
making
matter
which
is
especially
excluded
from
the
act,
but
if
it
does
reply,
it
would
lead
to
the
same
result.
but
if
the
court
feels
that
the
question--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i'm
just
turning
to
that.
if
the
court
feels
that
the
question
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
cannot
be
determined
on
this
record,
and
we
felt
there
was
some
indication
of
that
in
the
previous
argument
then
we
rely
on
our
motion
to
remand
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
admission
of
the
administrative
record
in
the
district
court.
we
do
not
think
that
there
should
be
a
remand
for
a
full
trial,
unless
the
district
court
finds
after
examining
the
administrative
record,
that
it
cannot
decided
the
issue
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
without
a
further
a
trial.
we
filed
the
motion
of
remand
not
for
the
purpose
of
conceding
error
here
as
mr.
vardaman
says,
but
for
the
purpose
of
narrowing
the
scope
of
any
remand,
and
for
the
purpose
of
negativing
any
suggestion,
that
there
should
not
be
such
a
limited
remand
because
we
have
not
asked
for
such
a
limitation.
now
the
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
virtually
expired.
i
will
have
to
summarize
my
remaining
points.
the
third
one
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
a
remand
here,
would
it
seems
to
me
be
a
triumph
for
formalism.
with
the
benefit
for
hindsight
this
record
is
not
all
that
i
might
like
to
have.
it
would
be
nicer,
if
the
secretaries
had
made
formal
findings
at
the
time
they
made
their
determinations,
though
they
have
made
such
a
findings
nows.
it
would
be
better,
if
we
didn't
have
to
piece
out
the
essence
of
their
determinations
from
other
actions
which
they
took
like
press
releases
and
resolutions
and
letters
and
affidavits.
and
it
was
for
this
reason,
that
we
moved
for
the
introduction
of
the
remand,
or
the
introduction
of
the
administrative
record,
but
is
this
not
really
an
exercise
in
futility.
would
it
not
be
a
triumph
of
formalism
over
substance
or
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
it's
well
known
words,
a
case
of
marching
the
king's
men
up
the
hill
and
then
marching
them
down
again.
and
remand
for
further
proceedings,
would
i
think
be
a
kind
of
mechanical
jurisprudence
more
of
fitting
for
barren
park
than
for
the
final
third
the
20th
century.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
my
point
is
that
i
think
that
there
is
ample
and
adequate
in
the
record
now
to
make
it
plain,
that
if
this
is
remanded,
it
will
great
deal
of
motion
will
be
generated
and
when
you
get
through
the
motion,
there
will
then
be
a
nice
new
record
which
will
have
adequate
material
to
show
that
the
route
is
not
--
there
is
no
feasible
and
prudent
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
we
think
that
there
isn't.
if
this
test
of
review
is
whether
the
secretary
acted
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
which
we
think
is
the
test,
we
think
it
is
a
apparent
from
this
record
that
neither
secretary
acted
in
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
manner,
ignoring
their
requirements
of
the
statue.
if
that
does
not
adequately
appear,
then
we
think
the
case
should
be
remanded
so
that
the
administrative
record
can
be
seen
by
the
district
court
and
that
question
determined
on
the
administrative
record.
what
we
think
should
not
be
done
here,
is
anything
which
requires
a
trail
type
hearing
before
the
secretary
or
anything
which
leads
to,
what
amounts
to
a
trial
de
novo
before
a
district
court
and
a
decision
of
this
question
in
effect
by
the
district
court
rather
than
by
the
secretary.
because
that
is
my
final
point,
a
fundamental
question
here,
one
of
the
separation
powers,
of
the
proper
allocation
of
the
function
that
courts,
legislatures
and
the
executive
branch
in
the
important
and
complex
task
of
carrying
on
government.
two
things
are
clear,
one
is
that
congress
is
legislated
certain
specific
requirements
with
respect
to
the
use
of
park
lands
and
the
other
is
that
it
is
allocated
the
administration
of
that
provision
to
the
executive
branch
specifically
to
the
secretary
of
transportation.
this
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
no
role
for
the
courts
where
the
secretary
should
be
held
and
check
if
he
ignores
the
legislative
requirements.
but
it
does
mean
that
the
proper
role
of
the
courts
is
now
unlimited
one
and
it
is
important
i
submit,
both
through
the
administration
of
the
government
and
for
the
courts,
that
the
limited
nature
of
that
role
be
recognized
and
observed.
it
is
not
good
government
to
have
all
governmental
decisions
decided
by
courts
or
even
that
have
a
situation
where
as
a
matter
of
routine,
all
questions
arising
in
the
administration
of
the
government
are
habitually
referred
to
courts.
in
recent
years,
more
and
more
governmental
decisions
are
being
made
by
courts.
the
recent
broadening
or
near
elimination
of
concepts
of
standing
and
the
limitations
on
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
have
contributed
to
this
result.
of
course,
court
should
see
that
the
constitution
is
complied
with
and
that
the
statutory
rules
are
followed,
but
is
it
wise
that
the
substance
of
all
administrative
actions
should
be
subject
to
reevaluation
in
the
courts.
what
the
two
secretaries
have
done
here,
they
have
acted,
what
they
have
done
is
rational,
and
it
complies
that
is
directives
given
to
them
by
congress.
the
decision
was
to
remand,
it
should
be
upheld.
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
afraid
i
have
trespassed
some
on
mr.
hanover's
time
and
i
hope
that
he
can
have
some
of
his
time.
