justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
i'd
like
to
get
to
it
now.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
to
give
a
little
prologue
to
my
question.
when
--
when
wiretapping
first
came
before
this
court,
we
held
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
--
"the
people
shall
be
secured
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures;
and
wiretapping
just
picked
up
conversations.
"
"that's
not
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects.
"
later
on,
we
reversed
ourselves
and,
as
you
mentioned,
katz
established
the
new
criterion,
which
is,
is
there
an
invasion
of
privacy?
does
--
are
you
obtaining
information
that
a
person
had
a
reasonable
expectation
to
be
kept
private?
i
think
that
was
wrong.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
original
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
nonetheless
it's
been
around
for
so
long,
we
are
not
going
to
overrule
that.
however,
it
is
one
thing
to
add
that
privacy
concept
to
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
originally
existed
and
it
is
quite
something
else
to
use
that
concept
to
narrow
the
fourth
amendment
from
what
it
originally
meant.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
that
device
is
installed
against
the
will
of
the
owner
of
the
car
on
the
car,
that
is
unquestionably
a
trespass
and
thereby
rendering
the
owner
of
the
car
not
secure
in
his
effects
--
the
car
is
one
of
his
effects
--
against
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
it
is
attached
to
the
car
against
his
will,
and
it
is
a
search
because
what
it
obtains
is
the
location
of
that
car
from
there
forward.
now,
why
--
why
isn't
that
correct?
do
you
deny
that
it's
a
trespass?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
too
bad.
that
doesn't
make
it
a
trespass.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
may
be
a
sneaky
thing
to
do,
but
--
but
every
sneaky
thing
is
not
a
trespass.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we've
narrowed
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
--
the
privacy
rationale
doesn't
expand
it,
but
narrows
it
in
some
respects.
justice
antonin
scalia
undoubtedly,
but
the
rationale
of
that
case
was
that
it
was
not
an
unreasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
not
an
unreasonable
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we
have
any
legislatures
out
there
that
could
stop
this
stuff?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
own
my
license
plate?
i
didn't
know
that.
how
do
you
know
that?
[laughter]
i
paid
for
my
license
plate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
ridiculous.
look
at
--
you
give
the
state
permission
to
put
the
license
plate
--
to
carry
--
to
have
your
car
carry
the
state's
license
plate.
you
do
not
give
anybody
permission
to
have
your
car
carry
a
tracking
device.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
whether
it's
put
directly
on
the
car
or
directly
on
something
that
the
car
is
carrying
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
doesn't
make
it
a
seizure.
that
doesn't
make
it
a
seizure.
it
makes
it
a
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
say
that
there
is
a
trespass
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information,
which
makes
it
a
search.
but
i
don't
see
how
it's
a
seizure.
a
seizure,
you
have
to
bring
something
within
your
control.
you
have
to
stop
the
person
or
stop
the
vehicle.
what
has
been
seized
when
you
--
when
you
slap
a
tracking
device
on
a
car?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
case
involving
seizure
of
--
of
data
floating
in
the
air
as
opposed
to
papers?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
must
be
unconstitutional
if
it's
scary.
[laughter]
i
mean,
what
is
it,
the
scary
provision
of
what
article?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
leckar,
your
--
all
of
this
discussion,
you're
going
into
it,
but
the
questioning
leads
you
into
it,
it
seems
to
me
leaps
over
the
difficult
part
of
your
case.
the
issue
before
us
is
not
--
not
in
the
abstract
whether
this
police
conduct
is
unreasonable.
the
unreasonableness
requirement
or
the
unreasonableness
prohibition
does
not
take
effect
unless
there
has
been
a
search.
and
our
cases
have
said
that
there
is
no
search
when
--
when
you
are
in
public
and
where
everything
that
you
do
is
open
to
--
to
the
view
of
people.
that's
the
hard
question
in
the
case,
not
whether
this
is
unreasonable.
that's
not
what
the
fourth
amendment
says,
the
police
can't
do
anything
that's
unreasonable.
they
can
do
a
lot
of
stuff
that's
unreasonable
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
--
the
protection
against
that
is
the
legislature.
but
you
have
to
establish,
if
you're
going
to
go
with
katz,
that
there
has
been
an
invasion
of,
of
privacy
when
all
that
--
all
that
this
is
showing
is
where
the
car
is
going
on
the
public
streets,
where
the
police
could
have
had
round-the-clock
surveillance
on
this
individual
for
a
whole
month
or
for
2
months
or
for
3
months,
and
that
would
not
have
violated
anything,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
because
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy.
so
why
is
this
an
invasion
of
privacy?
justice
antonin
scalia
100
times
zero
equals
zero.
if
--
if
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy
for
1
day,
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy
for
100
hundred
days.
now,
it
may
be
unreasonable
police
conduct,
and
we
can
handle
that
with
laws.
but
if
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy,
no
matter
how
many
days
you
do
it,
there
is
no
invasion
of
privacy.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is
a
tail.
so
is
a
tail
when
the
police
surveil
--
surveil
you
for,
for
a
month.
justice
antonin
scalia
excellent.
yes.
of
course
a
legislature
can
take
care
of
this,
whether
or
not
there
is
an
invasion
of
privacy.
and
they
can
pick
5
days
out
of
the
air.
you
can't
do
it
for
any
more
than
5
days,
or
you
can't
do
it
to
more
than
--
than
50
people
at
a
time.
they
can
take
care
of
all
of
that
stuff.
we
can't
do
that
in
a
decision
under
the
--
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
this
precisely
the
kind
of
a
problem
that
you
should
rely
upon
legislatures
to
take
care
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
of
congress's
business
if
it's
a
--
if
it's
a
purely
intrastate
operation.
congress
can
control
police
practices
that
don't
violate
the
fourth
amendment
throughout
the
country.
i
mean,
maybe
interstate,
interstate
beepers
and
interstate
tracking
devices,
yes,
but
so
long
as
you
track
within
--
within
the
state
isn't
that
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
2004,
the
respondent,
antoine
jones,
came
under
suspicion
of
trafficking
in
narcotics.
the
government
obtained,
from
the
united
states
district
court
here,
a
warrant
authorizing
the
installation
of
an
electronic
tracking
device
on
the
jeep
registered
to
jones'
wife
to
be
installed
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
within
10
days.
on
the
11th
day,
and
not
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
in
maryland,
agents
installed
a
gps
tracking
--
tracking
device
on
the
undercarriage
of
the
jeep
while
it
was
parked
in
a
public
parking
lot.
over
the
next
28
days,
the
government
used
the
device
to
track
the
vehicle's
movements.
in
the
later
trial
of
jones
and
others
on
drug
trafficking
charges,
the
district
court
suppressed
the
gps
data
obtained
while
the
vehicle
was
parked
at
jones'
residence
but
admitted
the
remaining
data
which
connected
jones
to
the
alleged
conspirators'
stash
house
that
contained
significant
amounts
of
cash
and
narcotics.
the
jury
returned
a
guilty
verdict,
and
the
district
court
sentenced
jones
to
life
imprisonment.
the
d.
c.
circuit
set
the
conviction
aside,
concluding
that
admission
of
the
evidence
obtained
by
the
warrantless
use
of
the
gps
tracking
device
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
we
granted
certiorari,
and
we
now
affirm.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
“the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures".
the
jeep
is
certainly
an
effect,
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
amendment.
we
hold
that
the
government's
physical
intrusion
on
the
jeep,
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information,
constitutes
a
search.
this
type
of
encroachment
on
an
area
enumerated
in
the
amendment
would
have
been
considered
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
at
the
time
it
was
adopted.
the
text
of
the
amendment
reflects
its
close
connection
to
property,
since
otherwise
it
would
have
referred
simply
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
says
"to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures".
the
--
that
last
phrase
would
have
been
superfluous.
consistent
with
this
understanding,
our
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
was
tied
to
common-law
trespass,
at
least
until
the
latter
half
of
the
20th
century.
our
later
cases,
of
course,
have
departed
from
an
exclusively
property
based
approach.
they
have
applied
the
analysis
of
justice
harlan's
concurrence
in
katz
versus
united
states,
a
1967
case
which
said
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation
occurs
when
government
officers
violate
a
person's
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
the
government
contends
that
justice
harlan's
standard
shows
that
no
search
occurred
here,
since
jones
had
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
area
of
the
jeep
accessed
by
government
agents,
namely,
the
--
the
underbody
and
in
the
locations
of
the
jeep
on
the
public
roads
which
was
visible
to
all.
we
do
not
address
those
contentions
because
jones'
fourth
amendment
rights
do
not
rise
or
fall
with
the
katz
formulation.
at
bottom,
as
we
said
in
kyllo
versus
united
states,
we
must
“assure
preservation
of
that
degree
of
privacy
against
government
that
existed
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adapted”.
katz
did
not
repudiate
the
understanding
that
the
fourth
amendment
embodies
a
particular
concern
for
government
trespass
upon
the
areas
that
it
enumerates.
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
test
has
been
added
to,
not
substituted
for
the
common
law
trespassory
test.
the
government
relies
heavily
on
two
post
katz
cases
in
which
we
rejected
fourth
amendment
challenges
to
the
use
of
beepers,
another
sort
of
tracking
device
that
the
government
had
placed
inside
a
container
of
chemicals
in
order
to
monitor
the
container's
movements.
in
the
first
of
those
cases,
united
states
versus
knotts,
we
held
that
the
monitoring
of
the
movements
did
not
violate
the
katz's
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
test
since
the
information
obtained,
the
location
of
an
automobile
carrying
the
container
on
public
roads
and
the
location
of
the
offloaded
container
in
open-fields
near
knotts'
cabin,
had
--
had
been
--
had
been
voluntarily
exposed
to
the
public.
the
common
law
trespassory
test
was
not
at
issue
in
that
case.
and
in
the
second
“beeper”
case,
united
states
versus
karo,
we
addressed
the
question
left
open
by
knotts,
whether
the
installation
of
a
beeper
in
a
container
constituted
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
but
as
in
knotts,
at
the
time
the
beeper
was
installed
in
karo,
the
container
belonged
to
a
third
party,
and
it
did
not
come
into
the
defendant's
possession
until
later.
karo
had
accepted
the
container
as
it
came
to
him,
beeper
and
all.
the
installation
of
the
beeper
had
not
violated
his
property
rights.
accordingly,
he
was
not
entitled
to
object
to
the
beeper's
presence
when
it
was
later
used
to
monitor
the
container's
location.
jones,
who
possessed
the
jeep
at
the
time
the
government
trespassorily
inserted
the
gps
device,
stands
in
a
different
position.
the
government
argues
in
the
alternative
that
even
if
the
attachment
and
use
of
the
device
was
a
search,
it
was
reasonable
and
thus
lawful
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government
did
not
raise
this
argument
below
and
the
court
of
appeals,
therefore,
did
not
address
it.
we
consider
the
argument
forfeited.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
sotomayor
has
joined
the
court's
opinion,
but
has
filed
a
separate
concurrence.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer
and
kagan
join.
