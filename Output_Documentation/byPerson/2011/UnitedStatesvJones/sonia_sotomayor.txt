justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you're
now
suggesting
n
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
which
is
it
would
be
okay
to
take
this
computer
chip,
put
it
on
somebody's
overcoat
and
follow
every
citizen
everywhere
they
go
indefinitely.
so
--
under
your
theory,
and
the
theory
espoused
in
your
brief,
you
could
monitor
and
track
every
person
through
their
cell
phone,
because
today
the
smartphones
emit
signals
that
police
can
pick
up
and
use
to
follow
someone
anywhere
they
go.
your
theory
is
so
long
as
the
--
that
all
--
that
what
is
being
monitored
is
the
movement
of
person,
of
a
person,
they
have
no
reasonable
expectation
that
their
possessions
will
not
be
used
by
you.
that's
really
the
bottom
line--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
track
them,
to
invade
their
sense
of
integrity
in
their
choices
about
who
they
want
to
see
or
use
their
things.
that's
really
argument
you're
making.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
cars
get
parked
in
a
garages.
it
happened
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
neither
does
a
person.
a
person
goes
home
and
their
overcoat
gets
hung
on
a
hanger.
what's
the
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
what
the
difference
between
this
and
a
general
warrant
is?
i
mean--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
motivated
the
fourth
amendment
historically
was
the
disapproval,
the
outrage,
that
our
founding
fathers
experienced
with
general
warrants
that
permitted
police
indiscriminately
to
investigate
just
on
the
basis
of
suspicion,
not
probable
cause
and
to
invade
every
possession
that
the
individual
had
in
search
of
a
crime.
how
is
this
different--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
kind
of
surveillance
where
there
is
no
probable
cause,
there
is
not
even
necessarily
reasonable
suspicion
in--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
case
is
not
that
vehicle.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
gps
technology
today
is
limited
only
by
the
cost
of
the
instrument,
which
frankly
right
now
is
so
small
that
it
wouldn't
take
that
much
of
a
budget,
local
budget,
to
place
a
gps
on
every
car
in
the
nation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
almost
every
car
has
it
now.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
going
to
be
dramatically
different
in
the
next
step.
there
are
now
satellites
that
look
down
and
can
hone
in
on
your
home
on
a
block
and
in
a
neighborhood.
i
don't
see
that
far
in
the
future
when
those
cameras
are
going
to
be
able
to
show
you
the
entire
world
and
let
you
track
somebody
on
the
camera
from
place
to
place.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
--
give
us
a
theory.
is
that
okay
for
the
police
to
access
those
cameras
and
look
at
you
moving
from
place
to
place?
and
if
that's
okay,
then
why
is
this
not
okay?
what
is
your
theory
of
your
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
there
are
about
28
satellites
up
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
an
unworkable
rule
with
no
--
tethered
to
no
principle.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
an
unworkable
rule
tethered
to
no
principle.
a
thousand
video
cameras
may
or
may
not
be
okay,
depending
on
how
large
the
city
is?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
idea
of
how
many
gps
devices
are
being
used
by
federal
government
agencies
and
state
law
enforcement
officials?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
seriously
argue
that
there
isn't
a
possessory
interest
in
who
puts
something
on
your
car,
and
who
you
--
like
a
--
a
sign
of
some
sort.
