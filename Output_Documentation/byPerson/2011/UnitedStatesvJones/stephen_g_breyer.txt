g.

but
what
--
but
what
is
the
question
that
i
think
people
are
driving
at,
at
least
as
i
understand
it
and
certainly
share
the
concern,
is
that
if
you
win
this
case
then
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
police
or
the
government
from
monitoring
24
hours
a
day
the
public
movement
of
every
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
--
and
the
difference
between
the
monitoring
and
what
happened
in
the
past
is
memories
are
fallible,
computers
aren't.
and
no
one,
at
least
very
rarely,
sends
human
beings
to
follow
people
24
hours
a
day.
that
occasionally
happens.
but
with
the
machines,
you
can.
so
if
you
win,
you
suddenly
produce
what
sounds
like
1984
from
their
brief.
i
understand
they
have
an
interest
in
perhaps
dramatizing
that,
but
--
but
maybe
overly.
but
it
still
sounds
like
it.
and
so
what
protection
is
there,
if
any,
once
we
accept
your
view
of
the
case,
from
this
slight
futuristic
scenario
that's
just
been
painted,
and
is
done
more
so
in
their
briefs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
that's
true.
and
they
do
have
a
limit.
in
this
case,
they
say
knotts
involved
a
single
journey,
or
let's
say
it
involved
four
journeys.
and
let's
say
it
involved
4
journeys
in
2
days.
this
involves
every
journey
for
a
month,
so
they
say
whatever
the
line
is
that's
going
to
protect
us,
it's
short
of
every
journey
in
a
month.
so
i'm
not
asking
--
i'm
saying
i
accept
your
point
there,
and
what
do
you
say
is
the
limit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
the
same
kind
of
guidance
that
you
have
in
any
case
of
this
court
that
uses
the
technique
which
is
used
sometimes,
and
i
think
it's
used
for
example
in
the
bribing
the
judge
case,
you
know,
with
campaign
contributions.
you
draw
an
outer
limit,
you
say
you
can't
go
beyond
that.
we
know
within
that
there
is
no
standard.
we'll
leave
it
for
the
lower
courts
to
work
out
and
we'll
review
it
over
time.
that's
not
necessarily
desirable,
but
that
is
a
method
this
court
has
sometimes
used.
but
even
if
it's
wrong,
i
want
to
know,
are
you
saying
there
is
no
limit
or
are
you
suggesting
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
won't
and
probably
couldn't
physically.
start
with
the
other
end.
start,
what
would
a
democratic
society
look
like
if
a
large
number
of
people
did
think
that
the
government
was
tracking
their
every
movement
over
long
periods
of
time.
and
once
you
reject
that,
you
have
to
have
a
reason
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
a
principle.
and
what
i'm
looking
for
is
the
reason
and
the
principle
that
would
reject
that,
but
wouldn't
also
reject
24
hours
a
day
for
28
days.
do
you
see
where
i'm
--
that's
what
i'm
listening
very
hard
to
find.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
a
violation
unless,
in
addition
to
a
search,
it
is
an
unreasonable
search.
and
since
you
already
--
and
the
same
is
true
of
seizure,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
already
have
everybody
agrees
it's
at
least
a
search.
so
what
do
you
care
whether
the
--
and
there
is
a
case
called
karo
which
says
whether
it's
a
trespass
doesn't
really
matter.
the
question
is
the
reasonableness
of
it.
and
that's
what
i
think
--
i
mean
you
can
argue
trespass
as
much
as
you
want,
but
i'll
still
have
in
mind
is
it
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think
that's
the
question
we've
been
debating.
and
i
would
like
to
know
from
you
--
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
parade
of
horribles
we
can
worry
with
--
worry
about
when
it
comes
up,
the
police
have
many,
many
people
that
they
suspect
of
all
kinds
of
things
ranging
from
kidnappings
of
lost
children
to
terrorism
to
all
kinds
of
crimes.
they're
willing
to
go
as
far
as
reasonable
suspicion
in
a
pinch.
and
they
say
at
least
with
that
you
will
avoid
the
1984
scenario
and
you
will
in
fact
allow
the
police
to
do
their
work
with
doing
no
more
than
subjecting
the
person
to
really
good
knowledge
of
where
he
is
going
on
the
open
highway.
they
probably
put
it
better
than
i
did,
but
i'd
appreciate
your
views
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
fact,
those
cameras
in
london
actually
enabled
them,
if
you
watched
them,
i
got
the
impression,
to
track
the
bomber
who
was
going
to
blow
up
the
airport
in
glasgow
and
to
stop
him
before
he
did.
so
there
are
many
people
who
will
say
that
that
kind
of
surveillance
is
worthwhile,
and
there
are
others
like
you
who
will
say,
no,
that's
a
bad
thing.
but
that
isn't
the
issue
exactly
in
front
of
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
justice
kagan
wanted
to
know
is
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
my
goodness.
sorry,
i
just
had
that
expression
because
i'm
reading.
"the
existence
of
a
physical
trespass
is
only
marginally
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
violated,
however,
for
an
actual
trespass
is
neither
necessary
nor
sufficient
to
establish
a
constitutional
violation.
"
that's
karo.
so
you
can
talk
if
you'd
like.
it's
your
hour.
but
i
would
really
be
very
interested
in
hearing
you
on
the
assumption
that
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
this
is
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
take
it
to
congress
the
other
way?
i
mean,
can
you
say
that
a
general
search
of
this
kind
is
not
constitutional
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
should
congress
pick
out
a
subset
thereof,
say
the
--
terrorism
or
where
there
is
reasonable
cause
or
like
the
fisa
court
or
special
courts
to
issue
special
kinds
of
warrants,
that
that's
a
different
question
which
we
could
decide
at
a
later
time?
that's
a
negative
way
of
--
i
mean
that
way
favors
you
in
the
result,
but
i've
--
i've
been
looking
for
if
there
is
a
way
of
going
to
congress
to
create
the
situations
where
they
can
do
it,
rather
than
the
situations
where
they
can't.
