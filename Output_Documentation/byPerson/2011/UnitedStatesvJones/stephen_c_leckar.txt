mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
talk
about
the
one
issue
that
the
united
states
didn't
talk
about,
which
is
whether
this
is
a
seizure.
this
case
can
be
resolved
on
a
very
narrow
basis,
a
very
narrow
basis:
what
are
the
consequences
when
the
police
without
a
warrant
install
a
gps
secretly
on
a
car
of
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
they
want
to
use
the
evidence
gained
that
way
in
a
criminal
trial?
our
position
is
that's
a
seizure.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
the
record
doesn't
show
in
this
case,
but
we
know
--
we
learned
last
week,
justice
alito,
from
the
nacdl
that
there
is
now
a
gps
on
the
market
that
weighs
2
ounces
and
is
the
size
of
a
credit
card.
think
how
easy
it
would
be
for
any
law
enforcement
agent
of
the
880,000
in
the
united
states
to
stick
one
of
those
on
anybody's
vehicle.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
well,
a
license
plate
as
i
understand
it
is
the
property
of
the
state
and
driving
is
a
privilege.
but
it's
not
a
technical
trespass
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jones
has
a
right--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--what
i'm
saying,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
scalia,
is
this:
that
the
issue
insofar
as
the
seizure
is
concerned
is,
is
it
meaningful.
everybody
agrees
here
that
there
is
--
that
antoine
jones
had
the
right
to
control
the
use
of
his
vehicle.
the
question
is,
was
the
interference
a
meaningful
deprivation
of
his
possessory
interest.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
they
can't
do
it.
they
can't
do
it,
your
honor.
it's
a
seizure.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
well,
first
of
all,
justice
--
chief
justice
roberts,
my
--
you
would
probably
see
the
gps
and
in
that
case--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--in
that
particular
case,
what
you
have
done
is
you
have
--
the
installation
of
the
gps,
it
is
a
seizure.
what
makes
it
meaningful
is
the
use
of
that
gps.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
but
it's
an
effect,
your
honor.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
effects,
it
protects
people.
if
you
put
it
on
somebody's
briefcase,
you
put
it
on
somebody's
car,
you
have
affected
their
possessory
interest.
then
the
question
becomes--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--as
i
--
thank
you,
justice
kagan.
as
i
said
moments
ago,
what
makes
it
meaningful,
what
makes
it
a
meaningful
deprivation
of
a
possessory
interest,
is
once
the
gps
gets
activated.
we
look
at
reality.
we
follow
what
silverman
v--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--your
honor--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--what
has
been
seized
is
antoine's
--
data.
data
is
seized
that
is
created
by
the
gps.
antoine
jones
has
the
right,
your
honor,
to
control
the
use
of
his
vehicle.
and
what
the
government
did
was
surreptitiously
deprive
him
of
the
use
of
that--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--the
closest
case
i
could
come,
your
honor,
would
be
silverman,
where
the
court
called
a
fourth
amendment
violation
where
the
spike
mike
just
touched
--
touched
the
ventilator
unit.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
reasonable
suspicion,
justice
breyer,
is
something
that
the
court
has
adopted
for
limited
intrusions.
and
i
refer
you
to
the
united
states
v.
place.
every
10
seconds
of
the
day
for
28
days
is
by
no
person's
lights
a
limited
intrusion.
that
said,
what
happened
--
what
happened
here
--
society
does
not
view
as
reasonable
the
concept
that
the
united
states
government
has
the
right
to
take
a
device
that
enables
them
to
engage
in
pervasive,
limitless,
cost-free
--
cost-free
surveillance,
that
completely
replaces
the
human
equation--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--what
happens
is
the
police
have
the
capacity
with
gps
to
engage
in
grave
abuse,
grave
abuse
of
individual
and
group
liberties,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
yes,
if
they
use
a
gps,
your
honor.
any
placement
of
a
gps
on
anybody's
car--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
asking--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--i
think
i
can
help
you
with
that.
we
are
not
asking
to
make
the
police
less
efficient
than
they
were
before
gps
came
into
effect.
we
are
simply
saying
that
the
use
of
a
gps
has
grave
potential,
grave
threats
of
abuse
to
privacy;
that
people
have
an
expectation,
justice
kennedy,
that
their
neighbor
is
not
going
to
use
their
car
to
track
them.
people
have
an
--
under
rakas
--
i
refer
the
court
to
footnote
12
in
the
rakas
case.
antoine
jones
had
control
of
that
car.
control
of
that
--
of
the
vehicle
meant
that
he
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
society
is
prepared
to
view
as
objectively
reasonable.
the
government--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--yes.
first
of
all,
you
have
a
physical
invasion.
that's
bond
v.
united
states.
you
have
an
invasion
of
his
possessory
interest,
placement
on
the
car.
physical
invasion
of
a
possessory
interest,
justice
ginsburg,
is
more
significant,
has
always
been
viewed
by
this
court
as
more
invasive
than
mere
video
--
mere
visual
surveillance.
and
even
with
a
camera,
it
depends
on
the
type
of
the
video
camera.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
police
are
prohibited
from
having
individual
video
cameras
or
several
video
cameras
to
surveil
people.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
this
device,
this
device
that
enables
limitless,
pervasive,
indiscriminate--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--it's
pretty
scary.
i
wouldn't
want
to
live
in
london
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
we
have
here
is
a
physical--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--because
you
have
a
physical
invasion
of
property.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
it's
not,
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
karo
case.
first
of
all,
in
karo
the
installation
was
essentially
consented
to.
you
took
--
the
package
came
in
by
virtue
of
somebody
who
was
working
for
the
government.
so
the
installation
was
not
unlike
this
case
--
was
unlike
this
case,
where
it
was
surreptitious
and
directly
engaged
in
by
a
government
agent.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
well,
but
technology,
as
you
observed,
justice
kennedy,
is
dramatically
different
with
gps
than
was
present
in
karo.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
well--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--our
theory,
justice
sotomayor,
with
respect
to
video
camera,
if
they
are
targeting
an
individual,
this
presents
a
gray
question.
it's
a
question
that
need
not
be
resolved
given
this
case.
but
if
the
court
wanted
to
address
that
question,
once
the
police
target
somebody,
they
want
to
engage
in
individualized
targeting
for
use
of
a
pervasive
network
of
cameras
--
and
gps
is
like
a
million
cameras.
that's
--
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
pointed
that
out,
and
this--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--all
right.
it's
28
cameras,
but
the
equivalent
of
a
camera
tracking
you
every
street
corner
you're
on
everywhere.
once
you
have
individualized
suspicion
like
that,
if
the
court
wanted
to
deal
with
it,
i
believe
you
would
have
to
have
a
warrant.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
no.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
because
it
is
--
it
is
a
complete
robotic
substitute.
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
tail.
and
interestingly
enough,
your
honor.
the
government
only
cited
in
its
brief
one
instance
of
a
24-hour
surveillance
for
all
of
2
days.
what
you
have
here,
justice
scalia,
is
--
i'm
going
to
refer
to
your
dissent.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
justice
scalia,
what
--
i'm
going
to
refer
to
your
dissent
along
with
justice
breyer
in
bond
v.
united
states.
a
gps
in
your
car
is,
or
anybody's
car,
is
like
--
without
a
warrant,
is
like
having
an
--
it
makes
you
unable
to
get
rid
of
an
uninvited
stranger.
that's
what
it
is.
now
what--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--the
question
we
have
to
answer
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
is
this.
a
tail
--
if
they
can
--
if
they
want
to
tail,
if
they
want
to
commit
the
resources,
that's
fine.
but
what
a
gps
does,
it
involves
--
it
allows
the
government
to
engage
in
unlimited
surveillance
through
a
machine,
through
a
machine
robotically.
nobody
is
even
involved
monitoring
it.
the
record
in
this
case
showed
that
many
times
the
police
officers
just
let
--
let
the
machine
go
on.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
our
position,
justice
alito,
is,
no
circumstances
should
a
gps
be
allowed
to
be
put
on
somebody's
car.
but
we
recognize--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--i'm
not
addressing
it
purely
as
a
trespass.
our
view
is
the
gp
--
the
use
of
a
gps
as
a
search
in
and
of
itself
should
be,
is
--
should
be
viewed
as
unreasonable.
but
if
the
court
were
uncomfortable
with
that,
if
the
court
had
concerns
with
that,
we
suggested
in
our
brief
some
possibilities:
one
day;
one
trip;
one
person
per
day
or
a
trip;
or
perhaps
when
you
use
it
exactly
as
a
beeper,
when
you
follow
it,
when
you
actually
physically
follow
it.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
because
it's
an
unreasonable
invasion
of
privacy,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
because
--
because
what
you
have
here
is
society
does
not
expect
that
the
police,
the
human
element
would
be
taken
out
of
--
would
be
taken
out
of
the
surveillance
factor.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
well,
the
use
of
a
cell
phone,
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
it.
as
justice
kennedy
observed
in
quon,
cell
phones
are
becoming
so
ubiquitous,
there
may
be
privacy
interests.
our
view
is
that
currently
the
use
of
a
cell
phone,
that's
a
voluntary
act.
people
nowadays
understand
that
there
are
ways
to
monitor
by
way
of
a
cell
phone.
but
i
started
my
oral
argument
with
this
basic
precept,
justice
alito.
this
case
does
not
require
us
to
decide
those
issues
of
emerging
technology.
it's
a
simple
case
at
the
core:
should
the
police
be
allowed
surreptitiously
to
put
these
machines
on
people's
cars
and
either
--
call
it
a
seizure,
call
it
a
search,
call
it
a
search
and
seizure,
in
the
words
of
katz,
or
call
it
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
a
note,
say,
or
even
a
bumper
sticker
like
you
get
at
south
of
the
border,
probably
nothing.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
it's
a
little
wafer
that's
got
an
enormous
capacity.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
no,
heavens,
no,
your
honor.
if
it
did
nothing,
first,
it
wouldn't
be
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
the
monitoring
makes
it
meaningful.
putting
it
on
enables
them
to--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--as
i
assume,
that's
because
of
manufacturers
doing
it,
or
because
congress
has
legislated
it,
justice
kagan?
under
either
circumstance,
people
would
know.
they
would
know
that
their
privacy
rights
have
been
taken
away.
whether
that
would
be
possible
to
go
through
congress,
i
seriously
doubt,
but
people
would
know.
in
this
particular
case,
antoine
jones
had
no
idea
whatsoever
that
his
possessory
interest
in
that
property
was
about
to
be
deprived
by
the
government
in
a
meaningful
way
to
allow
them
to
get
information
they
couldn't
have
otherwise
have
gotten.
justice
alito,
what
happens
here,
gps
produces
unique
data.
when
you
and
i
drive
down
the
street,
we
don't
emit
gps
data.
what
makes
gps
data
meaningful
is
the
act
--
is
the
use
and
placement
of
the
gps
device,
that
was
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
unconsented
to
by
antoine
jones
unknowingly.
and
the
government
knew
that.
that's
why
they
went
and
did
it
surreptitiously,
because
they
couldn't
get
it
any
other
way.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
i
think
that
would
be
allowable,
your
honor.
i
don't
think--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--i
think
that
would
be
permissible,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
you
don't
have
an
invasion
of
--
you
don't
have
a
physical
intrusion,
unlike
this
case.
people
nowadays--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--no,
your
honor.
as
i
said
earlier,
that
you
can
have
an
--
you
can
have
an
occasional
video
camera
out
there.
people
understand
nowadays
that
there
may
be
video
cameras
out
in
public
space.
the
--
but
we
don't
have
any
--
society
does
not
expect
or
view
it
as
reasonable
to
have
the
equivalent
of
a
million
video
cameras
following
you
everywhere
you
go.
a
few
video
cameras,
people
know.
they've
cropped
--
they've
cropped
up
and
they
have
been
accepted.
but
this
is
a
horse
of
an
entirely
different
color.
this
is
a
small
device
that
enables
the
government
to
get
information
of
a
vast
amount
of--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--the
camera
is
one
site
--
one--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
no,
justice
sotomayor.
i
think
the
workable
rule
and
the
simplest
rule
that
should
be
adopted
is
this.
i
think
the
court
should
say
to
the
law
enforcement
agency:
you
came
here
looking
for
a
rule;
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
rule.
if
you
want
to
use
gps
devices,
get
a
warrant,
absent
exigent
circumstances
or
another
recognized
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment,
because
of
their
capacity
for
--
to
collect
data
that
you
couldn't
realistically
get;
because
of
the
vanishingly
low
cost,
because
of
their
pervasive
nature,
that
you
should
get
a
warrant
any
time
--
you
must
get
a
warrant
any
time
you're
going
to
attach
a
gps
to
a
citizen's
effect
or
to
a
citizen's
person.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
that's
--
and
seizures.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
but
if
you
know,
if
you
the
police
agents
know
--
this
is
the
deliberative
process.
these
devices
aren't
used
for
just
quick
one-off
surveillance.
they
are
used
to
track
people
over
time,
as
witness
this
case,
every
10
seconds
of
the
day
for
28
days.
if
you
know
you're
going
to
do
that
and
you
know,
justice
roberts
that
this
device
--
this
device
has
an
amazingly
invasive
power
and
capacity.
if
you
know
you're
going
to
do
that
and
you're
a
law
enforcement
agent,
then
you
do
what
they
did
originally.
you
get
a
warrant.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
yes.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
i
--
i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because
of
the
--
society
does
not
expect
--
society
views
it
as
objectively
reasonable
not
to
expect--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--you
look
to
--
you
look
to
the
common
law.
you
look
to
well
established
case
law.
you
look
to
statutes
in
several
jurisdictions;
i
think
there
are
seven
or
eight
that
said
this
sort
of
practice
should
be
prohibited.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
we
have--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--that's
the
same
--
that's
the
same
--
same
problem
that
the
united
states
advanced
before
this
court
in
the
united
states
v.
district
court;
give
it
to
congress.
and
what
this
court
there
did,
it
held
a
fourth
amendment
violation
so
far
as
domestic
security
is
concerned
and
gave
congress
suggestions.
in
this
particular
case
i
could
probably
give
you
535
reasons
why
not
to
go
to
congress--
[laughter]
--but
let
me
suggest
something,
justice
scalia.
what
happened
was
the
united
states
has
adopted
a
shifting
position.
they
came
to
this
court
and
they
said
we
want
a
workable
rule;
give
us
a
workable
rule.
you
either
overrule
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
you
should
not
do,
or
give
us
a
workable
rule.
now
they
have
said
in
their
brief
oh,
let's
take
it
to
the
legislature.
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
justice
breyer,
that
was
exactly
what
congress,
what
happened
when
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
courts
were
created.
you
hit
it
right
on
the
nail.
all
this
court
has
to
do
is
decide
the
narrow
question
before
it,
which
i've
articulated
several
times.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
let
me
refer
to
chief
--
to
justice
frankfurter's
comments
a
long
time
ago
in
watts
v.
indiana:
justices
are
not
ignorant
of
the
law,
what
they
know
to
be
true
as
men
and
women,
but
other
legislatures
will
follow
congress.
but
what
we
have
here
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
live
case
of
controversy
in
which
antoine
jones'
control
of
his
vehicle
and
his
car
was
converted
into
an
electronic
gps
electronic
transceiver
serving
the
government.
so
that
case
is
here
and
it
--
it
needs
to
be
decided.
one
doesn't
need
to
address
technologies
that
aren't
here
before
the
court
today.
you
could;
we
could
venture
down
that
road.
we
could
discuss
drone
surveillance,
we
could
discuss
balloon
surveillance
and
other
types
of
surveillance,
but
we
don't
have
to.
it's
a
narrow--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--they
had
the
choice.
they
could
have
easily
--
they
could
have
gone
back
to
the
district
judge
and
said
--
given
the
district
judge--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--no.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
we
have
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
warrantless
intrusion.
when
--
when
the
warrant--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--but
the
warrant
was
not
in
effect.
at
the
--
at
the
time
the
--
the
gps
was
placed,
justice
alito,
there
was
no
warrant.
there's
a
case
this
court
decided
in
the--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--they
could
--
they
could
conceivably
gone
back
there
and
explained
to
the
district
judge
why
they
couldn't
have
installed
it
in
that
period
of
time.
the--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--i
understand
that.
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
c.
leckar
--there
is
a
1920
supreme
court
decision
decided
during
the
prohibition
era
that
specifically
said
that
when
a
warrant
expires
there
is
no
warrant.
when
the
10-day
rule
in
that
case
is
expired,
there
is
no
warrant.
we
have
a
warrantless
intrusion
here.
the
government
didn't
have
to
do
a
warrantless
intrusion.
i
ask
the
court
to
--
affirm.
