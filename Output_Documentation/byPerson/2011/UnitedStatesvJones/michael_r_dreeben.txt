mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
this
court's
decision
in
katz
v.
united
states,
the
court
has
recognized
a
basic
dichotomy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
what
a
person
seeks
to
preserve
as
private
in
the
enclave
of
his
own
home
or
in
a
private
letter
or
inside
of
his
vehicle
when
he
is
traveling
is
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
but
what
he
reveals
to
the
world,
such
as
his
movements
in
a
car
on
a
public
roadway,
is
not.
in
knotts
v.
united
states,
this
court
applied
that
principle
to
hold
that
visual
and
beeper
surveillance
of
a
vehicle
traveling
on
the
public
roadways
infringed
no
fourth
amendment
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
technology
is
different,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
a
crucial
fact
in
knotts
that
shows
that
this
was
not
simply
amplified
visual
surveillance
is
that
the
officers
actually
feared
detection
in
knotts
as
the
car
crossed
from
minnesota
to
wisconsin.
the
driver
began
to
do
certain
u-turns
and
the
police
broke
off
visual
surveillance.
they
lost
track
of
the
car
for
a
full
hour.
they
only
were
able
to
discover
it
by
having
a
beeper
receiver
in
a
helicopter
that
detected
the
beeps
from
the
radio
transmitter
in
the
can
of
chloroform.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
it
doesn't
expose
anything,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
isn't
already
exposed
to
public
view
for
anyone
who
wanted
to
watch,
and
that
was
the
crucial
principle
that
the
court
applied--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--probably
not,
justice
kennedy;
and
the
reason
is
that
this
court
in
karo
v.
united
states
--
united
states
v.
karo
--
specifically
distinguished
the
possibility
of
following
a
car
on
a
public
roadways
from
determining
the
location
of
an
object
in
a
place
where
a
person
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
that
event,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
a
serious
question
about
whether
the
installation
of
such
a
device
would
implicate
either
a
search
or
a
seizure.
but
if
it
did
not,
the
public
movements
of
somebody
do
not
implicate
a
seizure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
happy
to,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
may
be
a
technical
trespass,
but
it
was
equally
a
technical
trespass
in
the
united
states
v.
karo
when
a
can
of
ether
was
transferred
to
somebody
that
had
--
and
it
had
a
radio
transmitter--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
there
was
no
consent
to
the
owner
of
the
can
once
he
acquired
it
to
have
it
contain
a
foreign
item
installed
by
the
government.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
this
court
thought
that
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this
court
thought
that
it
was
a
technical
trespass
in
karo
and
said
that
made
no
difference
because
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
privacy
interests
and
meaningful
interferences
with
possessory
interests,
not
to
cover
all
technical
trespasses.
and
the
case
that
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
changes
it,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think
the
case
that
most
clearly
illustrates
the
distinction
between
trespass
and
fourth
amendment
protection
is
oliver
v.
united
states,
the
case
that
reaffirmed
the
open
fields
doctrine.
in
that
case,
there
was
absolutely
no
doubt
that
the
police
committed
a
trespass
under
local
law.
they
entered,
they
crossed
fences,
they
ignored
big
"no
trespassing"
signs;
and
this
court
held
that
the
interests
that
are
protected
by
trespass
law
are
distinct
from
the
interests
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
the
rationale
was
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
was
no
search,
justice
scalia.
the
rationale
of
that
case
was
that
open
fields
are
not
among
the
things
that
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
court
was
very
specifically
focused
on
the
distinction
between
trespass
law
and
fourth
amendment
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
justices
of
this
court?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
under
our
theory
and
under
this
court's
cases,
the
justices
of
this
court
when
driving
on
public
roadways
have
no
greater
expectation--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
equally,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
fbi
wanted
to
it
could
put
its
team
of
surveillance
agents
around
the
clock
on
any
individual
and
follow
that
individual's
movements
as
they
went
around
on
the
public
streets
and
they
would
thereby
gather--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think,
justice
alito,
that
there
is
a
particularly
dramatic
change
in
this
case
from
what
went
on
in
the
karo
and
the
knotts
cases.
it
is
possible
to
envision
broader
advances
in
technology
that
would
allow
more
public
information
to
be
amassed
and
put
into
computer
systems.
but
i
think
that
the
remedy
for
that,
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
principles
in
knotts
and
karo
and
applies
them
to
this
case,
the
remedy
is
through
legislation,
just
as
when
the
court
held
that
amassing
pen
register
data,
all
of
the
numbers
that
you
dial
on
your
telephone,
the
lengths
of
the
times
of
the
calls.
the
court
was
confronted
in
that
case
with
justice
stewart's
view
in
dissent--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
we
are
talking
here
about
monitoring
somebody's
movements
in
public.
we
are
not
talking
about
monitoring
their
conversations,
their
telephone
calls,
the
interior
of
their
cars,
their
private
letters
or
packages.
so
there
are
enclaves
of
fourth
amendment
protection
that
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
first
of
all,
this
is
exactly
the
argument
that
was
presented
to
the
court
in
knotts.
if
you
go
back
to
1983,
the
beeper
technology
in
that
case
seemed
extraordinarily
advanced
and
there
was
a
potential
for
it
to
be
used.
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
first
want
to
address
the
suggestion
that
you
could
draw
a
line
somewhere
between
a
month
and
a
trip
and
have
a
workable
standard
for
police
officers
to
use.
police
officers
use
a
variety
of
investigative
techniques
which
in
the
aggregate
produce
an
enormous
amount
of
information.
pen
registers,
trash
pulls;
they
look
at
financial
records.
they
conduct
visual
surveillance.
and
under
a
principle
of
law
that
says
1
trip
is
okay
but
30
trips
in
not,
there
is
absolutely
no
guidance
for
law
enforcement
in
how
they
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
suggesting
that
the
court
do
the
same
thing
that
it
did
in
knotts.
this
case
does
not
involve
24-hour
surveillance
of
every
citizen
of
the
united
states.
it
involves
following
one
suspected
drug
dealer
as
to
whom
there
was
very
strong
suspicion,
for
a
period
of
time
that
actually
is
less
than
a
month,
because
the
beeper
technology
failed
during--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
when
you're
talking
about
the
movements
of
a
car
on
a
public
roadway,
which
even
justice
breyer's
question
seems
to
concede
could
be
monitored
for
a
day
or
perhaps
4
days,
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
search
--
unless--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--so
does
a
pen
register,
so
does
a
garbage
pull.
so
does
looking
at
everybody's
credit
card
statement
for
a
month.
all
of
those
things
this
court
has
held
are
not
searches.
and
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
this
case,
there
would
not
have
been
any
difficulty
getting
a
warrant,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
warrant
authorized
things
beyond
just
monitoring
the
car.
it
authorized
entering
the
car
in
order
to
install
it,
which
wasn't
necessary
here.
it
also
authorized
monitoring
the
car
in
a
location
where
there
was
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
this
case
is
only
about
monitoring
a
car
on
public
streets.
but
i
think
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
--
the
principal
use
of
this
kind
of
surveillance
is
when
the
police
have
not
yet
acquired
probable
cause,
but
have
a
situation
that
does
call
for
monitoring.
and
i'd
like
to
give
an
example.
if
the
police
get
an
anonymous
phone
call
that
a
bomb
threat
is
going
to
be
carried
out
at
a
mosque
by
people
who
work
at
a
small
company,
the
bomb
threat
on
an
anonymous
call
will
not
provide
even
reasonable
suspicion
under
this
court's
decision
in
florida
v.
j.l.--
but
you
can
hardly
expect
the
fbi
to
ignore
a
credible,
detailed-sounding
piece
of
information
like
that.
now,
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
do
neither,
because
without
probable
cause
you
cannot
enter
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
the
--
the
police
in
this
situation
have
the
traditional
means
available
to
investigate
these
sorts
of
tips.
they
could
put
teams
of
agents
on
all
the
individuals
who
are
within
the
pool
of
suspicion
and
follow
them
24/7.
and
that
would
raise--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
that
goes
considerably
farther
than
our
position
in
this
case,
because
our
position
is
not
that
the
court
should
overrule
united
states
v.
karo
and
permit
monitoring
within
a
private
residence.
that
is
off
limits
absent
a
warrant
or
exigent
circumstances
plus
probable
cause.
and
monitoring
an
individual
through
their
clothing
poses
an
extremely
high
likelihood
that
they
will
enter
a
place
where
they
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
but
a
car
that's
parked
in
a
garage
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
its
location.
anyone
can
observe--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--once
the
--
once
the
effect
is
in
the
house,
under
karo
there
is
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
cannot
be
breached
without
a
warrant,
and
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
overrule
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
a
general
warrant--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--a
warrant
authorizes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--a
warrant
authorizes
a
search.
this
authorizes
the
ability
to
track
somebody's
movements
in
a
car
on
a
public
roadway,
a
subject
as
to
which
this
court
said
in
knotts
that
no
individual
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
when
they
go
out
in
their
car
their
car
is
traveling
on
public
roads.
anyone
can
look.
the
police
have
no
obligation
to
avert
their
eyes
from
anything
that
any
member
of
the
public--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
something
that
takes
place
in
public
isn't
inherently
off
limits
to
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
that's
essentially
the
holding
of
katz.
you
go
into
a
phone
booth,
you're
in
a
public;
making
your
calls
within
the
phone
booth
is
subject
to
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
but
this
court,
with
full
awareness
of
that
holding,
in
knotts
and
in
karo
recognized
that
surveillance
of
a
vehicle
traveling
on
the
public
roadways
doesn't
fit
that
description.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
probably
would
also
feel
differently
about
being
followed
24/7
by
a
team
of
fbi
agents,
who
gain
far
more
information
than
a
gps
device
produces.
gps
only
gives
you
the
approximate
location
of
the
car
as
it
drives
on
the
roads.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
approximate
speed,
the
location
traveled,
that
--
that
is
what
the
gps
provides.
it
doesn't
show
you
where
the
car
stopped.
it
doesn't
show
you
who
was
driving
the
car.
it
doesn't
show
you
who
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this
court
held
in
whren
v.
united
states
that
when
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
stop
someone
for
a
traffic
violation
they
can
do
that.
there
are
protections--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
it's
not
very
hard
for
police
to
follow
somebody
and
find
a
traffic
violation
if
they
want
to
do
that.
but
to
answer
in
part
justice
breyer's
earlier
concern
about
limiting
principles,
this
court
recognized
in
the
whren
decision
that,
although
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
a
restriction
on
discriminatory
or
arbitrary
or
oppressive
stops
that
are
based
on
invidious
characteristics,
the
equal
protection
clause
is.
the
first
amendment
also
stands
as
a
protection.
if
this
court
believes
that
there
is
an
excessive
chill
created
by
an
actual
law
or
universal
practice
of
monitoring
people
through
gps,
there
are
other
constitutional
principles
that
are
available.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
quite
sure,
justice
ginsburg,
that
if
you
ask
citizens
whether
the
police
could
freely
pick
up
their
trash
for
a
month
and
paw
through
it
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime,
or
keep
a
record
of
every
telephone
call
that
they
made
for
the
duration
and
the
number
that
it
went
through,
or
conduct
intense
visual
surveillance
of
them,
that
citizens
would
probably
also
find
that
to
be,
in
the
word
that
respondents
choose
to
use--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
--
all
right.
justice
breyer,
two
things
on
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
line-drawing
problems
that
the
court
would
create
for
itself
would
be
intolerable,
and
better
that
the
court
should
address
the
so-called
1984
scenarios
if
they
come
to
pass
rather
than
using
this
case
as
a
vehicle
for
doing
so.
second,
if
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
use
the
kinds
of
tracking
devices
that
were
used
in
this
case
on
everyone,
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
scalia,
the
legislature
is
a
safeguard,
and
if
the
court
believes
that
there
needs
to
be
a
fourth
amendment
safeguard
as
well,
we
have
urged
as
a
fallback
position
that
the
court
adopt
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard,
which
would
allow
the
police
to
conduct
surveillance
of
individuals
in
their
movements
on
public
roadways,
which
they
can
do
visually
in
any
event,
and
would
allow
the
police
to
investigate
leads
and
tips
that
arise
under
circumstances
where
there
is
not
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
in
most
reasonable
suspicion
cases,
it's
the
police
at
the
front
end
and
it's
the
courts
at
the
back
end
if
there
are
motions
to
suppress
evidence.
but
fundamentally,
just
as
in
the
pen
register
example
and
in
the
financial
records
example,
if
this
court
concludes,
consistent
with
its
earlier
cases,
that
this
is
not
a
search
yet
all
americans
find
it
to
be
an
omen
of
1984,
congress
would
stand
ready
to
provide
appropriate
protection.
if
i
may
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
advancing
technology
cuts
in
two
directions.
technological
advances
can
make
the
police
more
efficient
at
what
they
do
through
some
of
the
examples
that
were
discussed
today:
cameras,
airplanes,
beepers,
gps.
at
the
same
time,
technology
and
how
it's
used
can
change
our
expectations
of
privacy
in
the
ways
that
justice
alito
was
alluding
to.
today
perhaps
gps
can
be
portrayed
as
a
1984-type
invasion,
but
as
people
use
gps
in
their
lives
and
for
other
purposes,
our
expectations
of
privacy
surrounding
our
location
may
also
change.
for
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
kagan,
i
think
the
court
should
decide
that
case
when
it
comes
to
it.
this
was
my
fundamental
point:
this
case
does
not
involve
universal
surveillance
of
every
member
of
this
court
or
every
member
of
the
society.
it
involves
limited
surveillance
of
somebody
who
was
suspected
of
drug
activity--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
willing
to
assume
that
it
might
be,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
measures
the
meets
and
bounds
of
the
fourth
amendment
by
state
law
invasions
of
privacy.
the
court
usually--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
but
in
greenwood,
the
court
dealt
with
a
case
where
california
had
outlawed
taking
somebody's
garbage,
and
this
court
said
that
did
not
define
an
expectation
of
privacy
for
purposes
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
so.
and
--
and
the
fact
that
something
may
be
a
tort
for
a
private
person
doesn't
mean
it's
a
problem
for
the
police
to
do
it.
for
example,
in
the
dow
chemical
case,
where
the
police
used
--
epa
in
that
case
actually
used
cameras
to
surveil
an
industrial
plant.
there
was
a
claim
that
it
would
have
violated
trade
secret
law
for
anybody
else
to
do
that.
and
the
court
accepted
that
and
said
tort
law
doesn't
define
the
boundaries
of
the
fourth
amendment.
in
knotts,
the
court
was
very
careful
to
reserve
the
possibility
of
24-hour
surveillance
of
every
citizen
in
their
persons
and
in
their
residences,
saying
we
haven't
seen
that
kind
of
abuse.
if
that
kind
of
abuse
comes
up,
the
legislature
is
the
best-equipped
to
deal
with
it,
if
in
fact
our
society
regards
that
as
an
unreasonable
restriction
on--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
federal
government,
i
can
speak
to,
and
it's
in
the
low
thousands
annually.
it's
not
a
massive
universal
use
of
an
investigative
technique.
the
fbi
requires
that
there
be
some
reasonable
basis
for
using
gps
before
it
installs
it.
and
as
a
result,
this
is
a
technique
that
basically
supplements
visual
surveillance
rather
than
supplanting
it
all
together.
there
was
visual
surveillance
that
was
directed
at
respondent.
the
gps
allowed
it
to
be
more
effective.
as
justice
kennedy's
and
i
think
justice
scalia's
hypotheticals
illustrated,
respondent
is
essentially
conceding
that
around-the-clock
visual
surveillance
through
teams
of
agents
would
not
have
invaded
any
expectation
of
privacy.
this
court
said
in
knotts
that
police
efficiency
has
never
been
equated
with
police
unconstitutionality.
the
fact
that
gps
makes
it
more
efficient
for
the
police
to
put
a
tail
on
somebody
invades
no
additional
expectation
of
privacy
that
they
otherwise
would
have
had.
the
technology
doesn't
make
something
private
that
was
previously
public.
when
we
go
out
in
our
cars,
our
cars
have
driver's
licenses
that
we
carry.
we
have
license
plates
on
the
car.
these
are
for
the
purpose
of
identification--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--oh,
i
think
there
would
probably
be
some
sort
of
state
law
possessory
interests
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
finish?
but
there
is
no
seizure,
for
the
very
reason
that
justice
breyer
described
under
the
katz
case.
this
court
has
said
that
--
that
trespass
is
neither
necessary
nor
sufficient
to
create
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
