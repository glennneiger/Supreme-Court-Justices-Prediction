justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
that
rationale,
could
you
put
a
beeper
surreptitiously
on
the
man's
overcoat
or
sport
coat?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh
--
oh,
no.
this
is
special
device.
it
measures
only
streets
and
public
elevators
and
public
buildings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
on
that
latter
point,
you
might
just
be
aware
that
i
have
serious
reservations
that
there
wasn't
--
that
there
--
about
the
way
in
which
this
beeper
was
installed.
but
you
can
get
to
that
at
--
at
your
convenience.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
owner
of
the
can
at
the
time
it
was
installed
consented,
and
that
is
not
this
case.
there
is
no
consent
by
the
owner
of
the
property
to
which
this
device
was
affixed.
in
fact,
it
was
done,
as
justice
scalia
indicated,
surreptitiously.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
don't
need
to
get
into
it,
but
"live
free
or
die"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
does
it
have
to
be
cost-free.
suppose
the
police
department
says:
we've
got
two
things.
we
can
put
30
deputies
on
this
route
and
watch
this
person
or
we
can
have
a
device
with
a
warrant.
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
what
they
got
is
nothing
more
than
what
they
would
have
had
if
they
had
30
deputies
staked
out
along
the
route.
that's
all.
they'd
get
the
same
from
30
deputies.
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no.
we
are
assuming
that
there
is
no
initial
trespass,
which
is
a
problem
in
this
case.
you're
saying
it's
--
it's
the
quantity
and
--
of
the
information
seized
and
the
time
over
which
it's
seized.
and
that's
the
proposition
we
are
testing.
and
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
police
have
to
use
the
most
inefficient
methods.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
fully
aware
of
the
1984
ministry
of
love,
ministry
of
--
of
peace
problem.
but
this
--
your
argument
it
seems
to
me
has
no
principled
distinction
from
the
case
that
i
put.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
--
you're
mixing,
you're
mixing
two
things.
you're
the
one
--
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
initial
trespass
is
not
important.
that's
the
narrow
way
to
decide
the
issue.
you
don't
want
us
to
do
that.
so
now
we
ask
you
about
karo
and
you
say:
oh,
well,
there
was
a
trespass.
so
that's
--
that's
not
--
that's
not
a
responsive
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
lots
of
communities
have,
including
washington,
cameras
on
--
at
intersections
on
stop
lights.
suppose
the
police
suspected
someone
of
criminal
activity
and
they
had
a
computer
capacity
to
take
pictures
of
all
the
intersections
that
he
drove
through
at
different
times
of
day,
and
they
checked
his
movements
and
his
routes
for
5
days.
would
that
be
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
it
would
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
--
you
have
a
targeted
invasion.
it's
over
a
period
of
time.
it's
over
a
long
--
it's
over
a
wide
space,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
answer
my
question
yes
to
be
consistent
with
what
you've
said
earlier.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
probably
haven't
had
the
opportunity
to
go
on
a
vacation.
a
hypothetical.
suppose
exactly
these
facts,
only
the
police
aren't
involved.
a
neighbor
does
it
to
another
neighbor
in
order
to
see
where
that
neighbor
is
going,
and
when
he
finds
out,
he
tells
his
wife
and
--
and
other
neighbors.
do
you
think
that
in
most
states,
that
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
measure
it
by
expectations
of
privacy
under
the
katz
test
if
--
that
may
or
may
not
be
controlling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
found
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
privacy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
you
about
this
case,
whether
there
would
be
an
expectation
of
privacy
--
on
a
general
matter
under
tort
law.
