but
it
--
it
is
a
third
party
involved
in
the
telephone
--
in
the
pen
register
case.
and
here,
it's
the
police.
essentially,
i
think
you
answered
the
question
that
the
government's
position
would
mean
that
any
of
us
could
be
monitored
whenever
we
leave
our
--
our
homes,
so
the
only
thing
secure
is
the
home.
is
--
i
mean,
this
is
--
that
is
the
end
point
of
your
argument,
that
an
electronic
device,
as
long
as
it's
not
used
inside
the
house,
is
okay.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
dreeben,
this
case
started
out
with
a
warrant.
there
was
a
warrant
and
the
limits
weren't
followed.
the
warrant
said
10
days,
do
this
in
10
days,
and
the
police
took
11.
they
were
supposed
to
do
it
in
d.c.
instead,
they
did
it
in
maryland.
so
the
police
could
have
gotten
permission
to
conduct
this
search.
in
fact,
they
had
received
it.
now,
i
take
it
that
the
practice
had
been,
because
it's
in
the
electronic
surveillance
manual,
that
you
better
get
a
warrant.
was
there
any
problem
about
when
this
kind
of
surveillance
is
wanted
by
the
government,
get
a
warrant?
were
they
encountering
difficulty
getting
warrants?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
speed
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
an
easy
way,
to
pick
someone
up
for
speeding
when
you
suspect
something
far
worse
but
have
no
probable
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
when
the
police
came
upon
the
violator.
but
this
is,
it's
all
in
the
computer.
the
police
can
say,
we
want
to
find
out
more
about
x,
so
consult
the
database,
see
if
there
is
an
indication
that
he
was
ever
speeding
in
the
last
28
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fourth
amendment
protects
us
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
and
if
i
were
to
try
to
explain
to
someone,
here
is
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment
says
--
or
it
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
if
i'm
on
a
public
bus
and
the
police
want
to
feel
my
luggage,
that's
a
violation,
and
yet
this
kind
of
monitoring,
installing
the
gps
and
monitoring
the
person's
movement
whenever
they
are
outside
their
house
in
the
car
is
not?
it
just
--
there
is
something
about
it
that,
that
just
doesn't
parse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
would
be
under
your
test
the
judge
of
the
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
be
protected
against
a
surveillance
camera
that
could
get
information,
and
is
this
really
different
in
kind
from
the
surveillance
camera?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
that's
been
conceded
by
both
sides
and
that's
accepted
by
both
sides.
the
warrant
expired.
there
was
no
warrant.
the
government
certainly
could
have
gone
back
and
said,
judge,
we
didn't
make
it;
we
need
a
little
more
time;
give
us
10
more
days.
