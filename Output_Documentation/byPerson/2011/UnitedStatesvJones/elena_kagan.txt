mr.
leckar,
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
the
argument,
because
a
trespass
is
accomplished
no
matter
what
you
put
on
somebody's
car
or
somebody's
overcoat
or
what
have
you.
you
could
put
a
nonworking
device
on
somebody's
car
and
it
would
still
be
a
trespass.
but
surely
the
same
constitutional
problem
is
not
raised.
so
how
do
you
get
from
the
trespass
to
the
constitutional
problem.
justice
elena
kagan
what
is
the
difference
really?
i'm
told
--
maybe
this
is
wrong,
but
i'm
told
that
if
somebody
goes
to
london,
almost
every
place
that
person
goes
there
is
a
camera
taking
pictures,
so
that
the
police
can
put
together
snapshots
of
where
everybody
is
all
the
time.
so
why
is
this
different
from
that.
justice
elena
kagan
but
to
ask
justice
alito's
question
in
a
different
way,
suppose
that
the
police
could
do
this
without
ever
committing
the
trespass.
suppose
that
in
the
future
all
cars
are
going
to
have
gps
tracking
systems
and
the
police
could
essentially
hack
into
such
a
system
without
committing
the
trespass.
would
the
constitutional
issue
we
face
be
any
different?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dreeben,
that
--
that
seems
too
much
to
me.
i
mean,
if
you
think
about
this,
and
you
think
about
a
little
robotic
device
following
you
around
24
hours
a
day
anyplace
you
go
that's
not
your
home,
reporting
in
all
your
movements
to
the
police,
to
investigative
authorities,
the
notion
that
we
don't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
that,
the
notion
that
we
don't
think
that
our
privacy
interests
would
be
violated
by
this
robotic
device,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
how
one
can
say
that.
