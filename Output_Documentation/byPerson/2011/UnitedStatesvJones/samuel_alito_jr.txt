justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
seems
to
get
--
to
me
to
get
to
what's
really
involved
here,
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
technical
trespass
or
not
is
potentially
a
ground
for
deciding
this
particular
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
heart
of
the
problem
that's
presented
by
this
case
and
will
be
presented
by
other
cases
involving
new
technology
is
that
in
the
pre-computer,
pre-internet
age
much
of
the
privacy
--
i
would
say
most
of
the
privacy
--
that
people
enjoyed
was
not
the
result
of
legal
protections
or
constitutional
protections;
it
was
the
result
simply
of
the
difficulty
of
traveling
around
and
gathering
up
information.
but
with
computers,
it's
now
so
simple
to
amass
an
enormous
amount
of
information
about
people
that
consists
of
things
that
could
have
been
observed
on
the
streets,
information
that
was
made
available
to
the
public.
if
--
if
this
case
is
decided
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
technical
trespass,
i
don't
have
much
doubt
that
in
the
near
future
it
will
be
probable
--
i
think
it's
possible
now
in
many
instances
--
for
law
enforcement
to
monitor
people's
movements
on
--
on
public
streets
without
committing
a
technical
trespass.
so
how
do
we
deal
with
this?
do
we
just
say,
well,
nothing
is
changed,
so
that
all
the
information
that
people
expose
to
the
public
--
is,
is
fair
game?
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
search
or
seizure
when
that
is
--
when
that
is
obtained,
because
there
isn't
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
but
isn't
there
a
real
change
in
--
in
this
regard?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
size
of
this
device?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
size
of
this
device?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it
was
put
on
the
license
place.
would
that
be
a
technical
trespass?
is
that
the
property
of
the
driver?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
suppose
that
the
gps
was
used
only
to
track
somebody's
movements
for
one
day
or
for
12
hours
or
for
3
hours.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
put
aside
--
put
aside
the
trespass
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
sounds
like
a
legislative
line.
but
what
is
the
difference
between
following
somebody
for
12
hours,
let's
say,
and
monitoring
their
movements
on
a
gps
for
12
hours?
you
would
say
that
the
latter
--
your
first
argument
is,
there
is
a
problem
with
the
latter
but
not
with
the
former.
but
what
would
the
reason
for
that
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
--
what
is
the
difference
in
terms
of
one's
privacy
whether
you're
followed
by
a
police
officer
for
12
hours
and
you
don't
see
the
officer
or
whether
you're
monitored
by
gps
for
12
hours?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
know,
i
don't
know
what
society
expects
and
i
think
it's
changing.
technology
is
changing
people's
expectations
of
privacy.
suppose
we
look
forward
10
years,
and
maybe
10
years
from
now
90
percent
of
the
population
will
be
using
social
networking
sites
and
they
will
have
on
average
500
friends
and
they
will
have
allowed
their
friends
to
monitor
their
location
24
hours
a
day,
365
days
a
year,
through
the
use
of
their
cell
phones.
then
--
what
would
the
expectation
of
privacy
be
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
--
maybe
that's
a
good
way
to
decide
the
case.
but
i
just
wonder,
would
mr.
jones
or
anybody
else
be
really
upset
if
they
found
that
the
police
had
sneaked
up
to
their
car
and
put
an
inert
device
the
size
of
their
credit
card
on
the
underside
of
the
car?
what
would
they
say
about
that,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
police
are
wasting
money
doing
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
even
see
it.
it's
just
a
little
wafer,
they
put
it
under
the
car,
it
does
nothing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
this
one
does
nothing,
and
you
--
so
you
would
go
--
you
would
sue
--
you
would
bring
a
trespass
action.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what's
you're
concerned
about
is
not
this
little
thing
that's
put
on
your
car.
it's
not
this
invasion
of
your
property
interest.
it's
the
monitoring
that
takes
place.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
was
a
warrant
--
there
was
a
warrant
in
this
case.
this
is
a
puzzling
aspect
of
the
case
to
me
and
maybe
there
--
it's
irrelevant
for
present
purposes.
there
was
a
warrant
and
the
two
violations
of
are
violations
of
a
statute
and
a
rule,
neither
of
which
may
carry
an
exclusionary
rule
sanction
with
them
or
exclusionary
rule
penalty
with
them.
it's
not
clear
at
all
that
there
as
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
so
it's
a
little
strange
that
we
are
deciding
whether
a
warrantless
search
here
would
have
been
unconstitutional,
when
there
was
a
warrant.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
that's
not
my
point.
the
point
is
that
the
violation
of
the
10-day
rule
and
the
violation
of
the
statutory
prohibition
on
--
or
maybe
it's
in
the
rule,
the
prohibition
on
the
judge
in
the
district,
ordering
the
installation
only
in
the
district
are
not
fourth
amendment
requirements.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
not
a
warrantless
intrusion,
there
was
a
warrant.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
lower
court
case
law,
you
will
find
that
a
violation
of
the
10-day
rule
is
not
necessarily
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--doesn't
vitiate
the
warrant.
the
warrant
doesn't
necessarily
dissolve
or
evaporate
when
those
10
days
expire.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
those
cases
are
wrong.
