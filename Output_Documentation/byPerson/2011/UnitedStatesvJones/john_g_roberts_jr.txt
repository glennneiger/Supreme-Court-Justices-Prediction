chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1259,
united
states
v.
jones.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
knotts,
though,
seems
to
me
much
more
like
traditional
surveillance.
you're
following
the
car
and
the
beeper
just
helps
you
follow
it
from
a
--
from
a
slightly
greater
distance.
that
was
30
years
ago.
the
technology
is
very
different
and
you
get
a
lot
more
information
from
the
gps
surveillance
than
you
do
from
following
a
beeper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
good
example
of
the
change
in
technology.
that's
a
lot
of
work
to
follow
the
car.
they've
got
to
listen
to
the
beeper;
when
they
lose
it
they
have
got
to
call
in
the
helicopter.
here
they
just
sit
back
in
the
station
and
they
--
they
push
a
button
whenever
they
want
to
find
out
where
the
car
is.
they
look
at
data
from
a
month
and
find
out
everywhere
it's
been
in
the
past
month.
that
--
that
seems
to
me
dramatically
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
there
would
also
not
be
a
search
if
you
put
a
gps
device
on
all
of
our
cars,
monitored
our
movements
for
a
month?
you
think
you're
entitled
to
do
that
under
your
theory?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
is
yes,
you
could
tomorrow
decide
that
you
put
a
gps
device
on
every
one
of
our
cars,
follow
us
for
a
month;
no
problem
under
the
constitution?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
you're
--
you're
moving
away
from
your
argument.
your
argument
is,
it
doesn't
depend
how
much
suspicion
you
have,
it
doesn't
depend
on
how
urgent
it
is.
your
argument
is
you
can
do
it,
period.
you
don't
have
to
give
any
reason.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
limited
in
any
way,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
the
normal
way
in
these
situations
that
we
draw
these
limits
how
intrusive
the
search
can
be,
how
long
it
can
be,
is
by
having
a
magistrate
spell
it
out
in
a
warrant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
talking
about
the
difference
between
seeing
the
little
tile
and
seeing
a
mosaic.
the
one
gives
you
information,
the
other
doesn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
get
an
anonymous
tip
that
there
is
the
same
bomb
in
somebody's
house,
do
you
get
a
warrant
or
do
--
do
you
just
go
in?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
why
are
you
asking
for
a
different
rule
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
we
--
i
give
you
that,
that
it's
in
public.
does
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
trump
that
fact?
in
other
words,
if
we
ask
people,
do
you
think
it's
--
it
violates
your
right
to
privacy
to
have
this
kind
of
information
acquired,
and
everybody
says
yes,
is
it
a
response
that,
no,
that
takes
place
in
public,
or
it
simply
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
takes
place
in
public?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
see,
though,
can't
you,
that
30
years
ago
if
you
asked
people
does
it
violate
your
privacy
to
be
followed
by
a
beeper,
the
police
following
you,
you
might
get
one
answer,
while
today
if
you
ask
people
does
it
violate
your
right
to
privacy
to
know
that
the
police
can
have
a
record
of
every
movement
you
made
in
the
past
month,
they
might
see
that
differently?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
our
questions
have
eaten
into
your
rebuttal
time,
so
we'll
give
you
the
full
time.
mr.
leckar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
hear
an
answer
to
justice
alito's
question.
what
is
your
position
on
the
placement
of
the
gps
device
on
the
state-owned
license
plate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
my
understanding
is
correct
that
it's
the
state's
license
plate
that
they
require
you
to
have,
so
your
trespass
theory
it
would
seem
falls
apart
with
respect
to
that
particular
scenario.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it's
the
size
of
a
credit
card.
you
slip
it
behind
the
license
plate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
it
made
a
difference
under
your
theory,
which
focused
on
the
question
of
trespass,
because
it
was
attached
to
an
effect
owned
by
somebody
else.
this
is
an
effect
not
owned
by
the
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
trespass
theory
anyway
doesn't
seem
ridiculous
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
know
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
gets
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
which
is
you've
got
to
determine
that
there
has
been
a
search
first
before
you
impose
the
warrant
requirement.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
--
the
warrant
requirement
applies
only
with
respect
to
searches,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
and
seizures.
so
while
it
might
seem
like
a
good
idea
to
impose
the
requirement
on
this
particular
technological
device,
you
still
have
to
establish
that
it's
a
search.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
we
pushed
your
--
we
pushed
your
friend
to
the
limits
of
his
theory.
your
theory
i
take
it
would
apply
if
you're
going
to
do
it
for
3
minutes,
right?
where
is
the
car?
you
push
a
button;
it's
3
minutes;
you
say
that's
still
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
talk
to
me
about
how
long
they
are
going
to
be
doing
it,
or
all
the
information.
we
have
to
test
the
validity
on
the
theory
of
your
proposition
that
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment
to
do
this
for
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
that
several
times.
how
do
we
tell?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
society
expects.
i
suppose
if
you
ask
people
do
you
think
it's
a
violation
of
privacy
for
the
police
to
do
this
for
no
reason
for
a
month,
maybe
they
would
come
out
one
way.
if
you
asked
the
people
do
you
think
the
police
have
to
have
probable
cause
before
they
monitor
for
5
minutes
the
movements
of
somebody
they
think
is
going
to
set
off
a
huge
bomb,
maybe
you
get
a
different
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben,
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1259,
united
states
versus
jones.
