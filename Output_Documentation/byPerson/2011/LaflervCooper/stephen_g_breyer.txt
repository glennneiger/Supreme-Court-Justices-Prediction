justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
--
first,
there
is
nothing
about
this
in
the
sixth
amendment,
is
there?
i
mean,
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
talks
about
criminal
prosecutions
requiring
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
defense,
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
nothing
in
the
sixth
amendment
that
has
these
qualifications.
i
haven't
seen
anything
in
any
case
which
was
other
than
case
specific.
that
is,
this
issue
hasn't
been
decided
before,
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
language
can
be
taken
out
of
those
cases,
as
you
have
very
properly
done.
and
so
there
is
nothing
that
i
could
find
in
the
cases.
there
is
nothing
in
the
sixth
amendment
itself.
in
95
percent
of
the
cases,
they
do
plead
guilty.
and
what's
the
problem
about
ordering
the
prosecution
to
simply
repeat
the
offer
he
gave
before?
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
really
see
if
there
--
and
prejudice?
well,
if
a
person's
been
executed,
if
he
had
gotten
the
--
if
he
had
gotten
the
plea
offer,
he
would
have
pled
guilty
for
50
years
in
jail,
okay?
that's
my
imaginary
case.
i
can
think
of
one
where
there's
prejudice.
he's
dead.
all
right.
so
what's
the
answer
in
my
imaginary
case,
if
it's
not
in
the
amendment,
not
a
holding,
etc?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
--
i
want
to
stop
you
there
because
i
don't
understand
it.
the
suggestion
is
--
i'm
not
taking
this
case,
i'm
making
up
a
hypothetical
since
we
are
discussing
it
really
based
on
the
next
case.
the
defendant
never
heard
the
offer,
never
heard
it.
it
is
crystal
clear
that
if
he'd
heard
it,
he
would
have
accepted
it.
okay.
i'm
trying
to
separate
out
difficulties
of
this
case,
which
strikes
me
as
difficult
because
of
the
facts,
from
the
principle.
and
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
tell
me
why
i
shouldn't
accept
the
principle,
and
then
we
can
worry
about
what's
a
clear
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
death.
let's
say
death.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
shows
that
never
did
he
ever
become
aware,
because
his
lawyer
was
sleeping
and
moved
on
vacation
and
never
told
him
about
the
plea
offer.
that's
my
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
if
you
don't
want
to
do
the
capital
case,
i'm
still
trying
to
get
to
the
principle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
will
change
my
hypothetical
and
say
all
that
happened
was
that
this
perfect
trial
because
of
mandatory
sentencing
rules
led
him
to
prison
for
50
years,
as
compared
with
a
plea
bargain
that
would
have
given
him
2
years.
now,
he
is
in
prison
for
48
years
more,
and
i
consider
that
that
is
at
least
harmful
to
him.
so
where
the
amendment
doesn't
speak
of
it,
where
the
misbehavior
of
the
lawyer
is
crystal
clear,
where
it's
48
years
more
in
prison,
what
is
it
that
bars
what
seems
to
me
obvious
that
an
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel,
remedial
through
a
specific
decree
saying
reinstitute
the
offer,
led
to
enormous
unfairness
and
prejudice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
say
there
is
an
occasion
where
people
don't
get
the
sentence
that
they
deserve
because,
for
example,
the
lawyer
was
inadequate.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem.
the
problem
with
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
i
take
it,
is
what
the
order
would
say
is
that
the
prosecution
has
to
for
a
reasonable
time
extend
the
same
offer.
and
then
if
it's
accepted,
you
go
to
the
judge.
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
accept
the
plea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
make
him
do
that.
but
i
have
a
bigger
problem
with
this
case,
which
is
--
which
i
may
be
the
only
one
to
have.
but
as
i've
looked
at
it,
i
don't
see
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
within
the
aedpa
meaning.
that
is,
you
have
two
courts
in
the
state
which
have
said
this
is
not
ineffective,
and
as
i
look
at
it
it's
somewhat
ambiguous
at
best
--
and
we
have
the
sixth
circuit
saying
it
is.
well,
i
know
both
sides
agree,
but
i
mean,
both
sides
couldn't
make
us
decide
a
case
by
saying
there's
a
murder
when
in
fact
it's
not.
i
mean,
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
about
that?
i
find
this
a
tough
case.
i
have
read
the
record,
and
in
my
own
opinion
at
this
moment,
perhaps
no
one
else's,
there
is
no
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
such
that
the
sixth
circuit
could
set
that
aside
--
a
contrary
finding
of
the
state
court.
so
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why,
why
wouldn't
the
remedy
be
--
as
--
judging
from
what
you
said
before,
is
an
order
saying
to
the
prosecution,
re-institute
the
plea
bargain
and
give
him,
a
week
or
whatever
it
is.
now
we
imagine
the
defendant
says
i
accept.
so
then
they
go
to
the
judge,
just
as
they
would
have
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
judge
has
the
freedom
to
accept
that
or
to
reject
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
rejects
it,
there
is
no
plea
agreement.
now
the
defendant
must
plead.
he
can
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty.
and
whatever
flows
from
that,
flows
from
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
suggestion
is
perfect
but
mine
is
more
perfect.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't,
you
would
--
he's
right,
you
would
have
to,
under
my
suggestion,
have
a
new
trial;
even
though
there
was
a
trial
that
took
place
two
years
ago
or
whatever
it
is,
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't
the
end
of
the
argument.
so,
if
you
are
the
defense
counsel,
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
not
communicate
any
plea
offer
you
get,
and
then
if
your
client
is
found
guilty,
then
you
can
go
back
and
say,
oh
by
the
way,
i
didn't
tell
you
about
this,
and
he
gets
a
whole
new
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let's
go
back
because
i'm
now
becoming
convinced
--
i
am
--
i
am
trying
out
what
justice
scalia
suggested.
maybe
that
does
work
better.
what
--
what
you'd
say
is
first,
throw
the
defendant
out,
unless
you
are
convinced
that
not
only
is
there
ineffective
assistance,
but
also
it
would
have
made
a
difference;
he
would
have
accepted
the
plea
bargain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
they
have
to
hold
the
plea
bargain
open.
they
then
do
it.
they
then
go
to
the
judge,
like
any
plea
bargain.
90
percent
of
the
time
the
judge
will
say
fine,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
should
the
judge
decide
that
this
is
a
case
where
he
would
reject
the
plea
bargain,
for
any
one
of
a
variety
of
reasons,
then
our
assumption
was
wrong
and
we
reinstate
the
previous
trial.
now
does
a
judge
just
say
it's
over,
you
were
tried,
you
were
convicted,
that's
the
end
of
it?
what's
wrong
with
that
as
a
remedy?
i
mean,
what's
--
why
is
that
--
why
does
that
muck
up
the
criminal
justice
system
in
some
way?
i
think
that's
pretty
much
what
justice
scalia
suggested,
and
i
--
and
i
am
now
trying
that
out,
because
the
more
i
think
about
it,
the
more
i
think
maybe
that's
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i--
