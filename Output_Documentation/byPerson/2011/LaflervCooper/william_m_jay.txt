mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
convictions
and
sentence
are
reliable
because
the
proceedings
that
produced
them
were
reliable.
and
to
collaterally
attack
his
convictions
or
his
sentence
based
on
allegedly
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
he
has
to
show
that
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
prejudiced
him.
as
this
court's
strickland
cases
have
used
that
term,
that
means
he
has
to
show
that
a
reviewing
court
should
lack
confidence
in
the
proceeding
that
produced
the
convictions
or
the
sentence.
mr.
william
m.
jay
the
sixth
amendment
requires
the
assistance--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
i
think
that
--
let
me
address
that
capital
hypothetical
that
has
come
up
several
times.
and
i
think
that
it's
instructive,
justice
breyer,
to
look
at
this
court's
strickland
cases
and
look
at
what
remedy
they
order
when
there
has
been
ineffective
assistance
that
shakes
the
reviewing
court's
confidence
in
the
proceeding
that
produced
it.
they
order
a
new
proceeding.
they
don't
order
a
specific
sentence.
that's
why
the
outcome
has
never
been
the
yardstick
by
which
ineffective
assistance--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--but
i
think
the
principle,
justice
breyer,
is
that
you
look
at
what
--
you
look
at
what
it
is
the
court's
being
asked
to
set
aside.
mr.
william
m.
jay
right.
so
in
this
case
you
look
at
the
death
sentence.
how
was
that
death
sentence
produced?
if
the
defendant
can
show,
for
example,
that
he
got
bad
advice
about
the
plea--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
think
that's
actually
an
easier
hypothetical
than
the
bad
advice
because
you
could
show
that
if
the
lawyer
then
gets
--
stands
up
and
does
a
bang-up
job
at
trial
--
the
defendant
is
convicted
of
capital
murder,
the
defendant
can't
show
any
prejudicial
effect
on
the
trial
--
that
means
that
no
other
lawyer
doing
a
better
job
could
have
gotten
the
defendant
--
could
even
show
a
reasonable
probability
that
a
different
verdict
would
ensue.
that
defendant
has
a
reliable
capital
murder
conviction.
mr.
william
m.
jay
this
is
not
a
capital
case,
and
i
think
that
it
certainly--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i'm
happy
to
do
the
capital
case--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--two
points,
justice
breyer,
and
i
want
to
make
sure
i
get
out
my
answer
to
your
capital
hypothetical,
because
you
don't
look
just
at
whether
the
sentence
that
resulted
was
worse
than
the
sentence
that
could
have
resulted.
if
that
were
the
case,
fretwell
would
have
come
out
the
other
way.
that
is
death,
with
no
objection
made,
life
sentence
if
the
objection
had
been
made.
so
it's
not
an
outcome
--
it's
not
a
narrow
comparison
of
outcomes.
what
you
look
at
is
how
the
sentence
was
produced.
is
this
defendant
entitled,
had
this
--
to
a
lesser
sentence?
is
this
--
had
this
defendant
had
a
better
lawyer
at
sentencing,
is
there
even
a
reasonable
probability
that
that
lawyer,
through
a
different
strategy
for
identifying
a
legal
error--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--and
in
those
cases,
justice
breyer,
you
show
that
the
lawyer
had
a
bad
strategy
at
sentencing.
that
may
well
have
been
the
same
bad
strategy
that
led
the
lawyer
to
recommend
a
not
guilty
plea.
let's
go
to
trial
on
my
crazy
strategy.
if
he
can
show
that
and
he
can
show
that
a
better
lawyer
with
a
better
strategy
would
produce
a
different
result,
then
the
sixth
amendment
entitles
that
person
to
a
new
proceeding.
the
sixth
amendment
never
entitles
a
person
to
have
a
court
order
a
particular
sentence.
and
you
can't
use
the
prosecutor's
offer
made
at
a
different
time
as
the
benchmark
and
say:
well
the
prosecutor
was
okay
with
it
at
this
other
time;
therefore,
the
prosecution
must
be
forced
to
live
with
it
now.
and
that's
because
a
plea
offer
rests
on
a
number
of
considerations:
the
need
to
obtain
the
defendant's
cooperation
in
other
cases;
the
desire
to
spare
the
witnesses
and
the
victim
the
burdens
of
trial;
and
frankly,
to
avoid
the
risk
of
an
acquittal.
and
the
prosecution
in
this
case
and
in
cases
like
this
one,
where
there
has
been
a
reliable
conviction
and
reliable
sentencing,
the
prosecution
has
already
incurred
all
of
those
burdens.
so
to
look
at
the
51-month
minimum
offer
that
was
made
8
years
ago
and
have
that
be
the
benchmark
simply
is
not
something
that
this
court
has
ever
done
in
its
strickland
cases.
and
i
think
it's
revealing
about
the
respondent's--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--we
are
--
we
are
assuming
that
--
that
mr.
cooper
in
this
case
had
a
right
to
receive
effective
advice
about
whether
to
enter
this
plea.
but
our
position
is
that
he
wasn't
prejudiced
because
what--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
again,
we
don't
think
this
is
in
any
way
crucial
to
deciding
this
case,
but
scott
v.
illinois,
justice
kagan,
is
an
example
of
that.
mr.
william
m.
jay
it
certainly
is
correct
that
pleading
--
a
guilty
plea
hearing,
where
the
defendant--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--that's
not
at
all
what
we
are
asking,
justice
kennedy.
what
we
are
asking--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--our
test
to
resolve
this
case
is
to
look
at
what
it
is
that
the
habeas
petitioner
is
challenging.
he's
challenging
the
conviction
and
the
sentence.
in
the
conviction,
he
was
found
guilty
by
a
jury.
he
now
says,
page
14a
of
the
red
brief,
that
he
is
guilty
and
he
wishes
he
had
pleaded
guilty
sooner.
no
basis
for
challenging
the
conviction.
may
i
finish
the
thought
on
the
sentence?
mr.
william
m.
jay
and
--
on
this
sentence,
he
was
sentenced
in
accordance
with
law.
he
had
effective
representation
at
sentencing
and
he
got
the
sentence
that
corresponds
to
the
counts
of
conviction.
what
he
wants
is
to
reinstate
a
deal
that
was
in
the
prosecution's
discretion
to
offer
once
upon
a
time.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
