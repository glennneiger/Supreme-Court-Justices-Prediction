justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
this
were
a
death
--
a
death
case,
and
roughly
the
--
the
same
facts,
failure
--
failure
to
communicate.
and
that
leads
me
just
to
one
other
question
that
is
based
on
your
opening
remarks.
we
can
think
about
adjudication
as
having
a
constitutional
violation,
injury,
and
remedy.
are
you
saying
that
there
was
a
violation
in
the
abstract
here
but
no
injury,
or
was
there
a
violation
and
an
injury
but
just
no
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
could
do
all
of
that,
including
the
death
penalty.
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
you
skipped
over
a
step.
i
think
we
do
assume
that
the
deficient
advice
led
to
the
determination
to
plead
not
guilty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
the
question
--
that's
the
question
we're
confronting.
so
i
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--your
answer
was
a
little
too
facile
on
that
point.
we
have
to
assume
there
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
advising
the
client
the
nature
of
the
charge
so
that
the
client
can
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty.
we
have
to
assume
that
in
this
case,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
would
also
be
your
position
in
a
capital
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
gets
back
to
my
question:
is
it
a
violation
in
the
abstract,
damnum
absque
injuria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
damage
without
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
correct,
but
is
it
enough?
do
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
that
plea
negotiations
are
not
a
critical
stage
of
the
criminal
process
unless
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
guilty
plea
results?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
justice
kagan
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
test
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
is
the
judge
supposed
to
do?
let's
say
the
remedy
is
it
goes
back
before
the
judge.
we
are
trying
to
unwind
the
clock
or
whatever
the
metaphor
is.
does
the
judge
have
to
prescind
all
knowledge
of
what
he
learned
in
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
asking
what
--
i'm
a
conscientious
decisionmaker
and
i'm
asking
for
your
advice
on
what
i
should
do.
i
know
the
details
of
this
crime,
which
were
more
horrific
than
i
would
have
expected
because
i've
heard
them
at
the
trial.
do
i
just
somehow
forget
about
that
--
prescind
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
answer
is
"yes".
i
--
i
ignore
everything
that
i
learned
during
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
that.
but,
as
an
administrative
matter,
i
think
we
have
to
have
some
concern
that
these
plea
negotiations
and
discussions
are
in
myriad
circumstances.
the
defense
attorney
is
by
the
water
cooler
and
the
prosecutor
walked
by
and
says
i'm
thinking
of
offering
you
a
good
bargain
in
the
jones
case.
he
knows
he's
going
to
have
that
prosecutor
in
court
the
next
day
and
really
beat
him.
he
thinks
he's
going
to
soften
him
up,
so
he
doesn't
communicate
it
to
the
client
and
the
prosecutor
later
says
withdrawn.
we
are
going
to
have
inquiries
post
hoc
on
all
these
negotiations
and
discussions.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
absent
some
other
rule,
like
i
don't
think
we
have
the
authority
to
impose
that
all
plea
offers
must
be
in
writing
and
be
stated
with
specificity,
if
that
is
what
you
are
proposing,
is
simply
unworkable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
can
answer
the
chief
justice's
question.
the
chief
justice
said
how
are
you
going
to
know
--
you
have
to
show
prejudice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
saying
it
was
unfair
to
have
a
fair
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
saying
it's
unfair
to
have
a
fair
trial;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
has
to
be
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
--
it's
more
proper,
i
think,
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
under
the
federal
rules,
rule
11,
there
has
to
be
a
colloquy
before
a
plea
is
entered.
do
you
think
the
federal
rules
and
perhaps
state
rules
should
be
amended
so
that
judges,
trial
judges
before
imposing
a
sentence
inquire:
have
there
been
plea
offers;
have
they
all
been
communicated
to
the
defendant?
is
that
good
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
they
had
--
if
plea
offer
had
come
out
--
i
don't
know
how
it
would
work.
when
you
enter
a
not
guilty
plea,
you
enter
a
not
guilty
plea.
