justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
all
of
this
is
theoretically
interesting
and
it
may
be
that
capital
cases
are
sui
generis
here.
but
i
thought
the
heart
of
your
argument
was
that
there
just
is
no
way
to
unscramble
the
eggs
in
this
situation;
there
is
no
--
and
that
was
your
third
point,
i
understood
it--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--there
is
no
remedy
that
can
put
the
parties
back
into
the
position
where
they
would
have
been
had
the
error
regarding
the
legal
issue
not
occurred.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
court
has
said
that
death
is
different.
do
you
think
it
is
inconceivable
that
there
could
be
a
different
rule
for
capital
cases,
such
as
a
rule
requiring
that
in
a
capital
case
any
offer
of
a
noncapital
sentence
as
part
of
the
plea
bargain
can
actually
be
waived
by
the
defendant
in
court
so
that
this
doesn't
come
up?
this
is
not
a
capital
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
relief
that
you
want
is
specific
performance
on
the
plea
bargain.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
correct?
what
if
it
had
come
to
light,
come
to
the
prosecutor's
attention
during
this
intervening
time,
that
your
client
had
committed
four
or
five
other
shootings?
would
you
still
be
entitled
to
specific
performance?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
that's
pretty
incredible.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
defendant
has
done
in
the
--
has
been
discovered
to
have
done
in
the
interim.
committed
five
murders,
ten
murders?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wipe
it
out
of
your
mind;
you
get
--
you
get
the
plea
bargain
that
was
offered
at
an
early
point
in
--
in
the
investigation
of
the
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
that's
going
to
be
so
hard
to
show.
do
you
think
it's
feasible
to
draw
a
distinction
between
this
case,
where
there
was
arguably
inaccurate
legal
advice,
and
the
case
in
which
the
defense
attorney
simply
makes
a
terribly
mistaken
calculation
about
the
chances
of
a
favorable
verdict
at
trial?
a
favorable
plea
bargain
is
offered,
caps
the
guy's
possible
sentence
at
let's
say
three
years.
the
defense
attorney
says,
we've
got
a
great
shot
at
an
acquittal,
let's
go
to
trial.
i'm
going
to
rip
the
prosecution's
witnesses
apart.
the
trial
turns
out
to
be
a
disaster.
convicted
on
all
counts.
25
years.
do
you
think
that
it's
impossible
for
the
rule
that
you
want
us
to
adopt
here
to
be
applied
in
that
situation
as
well?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--a
situation
where
the
--
where
the
defendant
turns
down
--
where
a
plea
is
turned
down
and
the
defendant
goes
to
trial,
are
there
any
facts
in
--
any
facts
that
would
make
any
remedy
other
than
specific
performance
the
correct
remedy
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
recommend
--
you're
recommending
specific
performance
as
the
remedy
for
your
case,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
is,
if
there
is
to
be
a
remedy,
it's
the
only
remedy
that
makes
a
--
any
modicum
of
sense.
the
remedy
of
giving
a
new
trial
when
the
person
has
already
had
a
fair
trial
makes
zero
sense.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
i'm
looking
for
is
any
situation
--
you
said
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
but
what
is
--
what
discretion
is
there?
what
remedy
in
that
situation
other
than
specific
performance
would
be
an
appropriate
--
would
remedy
what
you
claim
to
have
been
the
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
the
length
and
the
complexity
of
the
trial
has
any
bearing
on
this?
this
was
a
relatively
short
and
simple
trial.
but
let's
say
a
prosecutor
offers
a
plea
deal
in
a
case
in
which
the
trial
is
going
to
take
6
months
and
it's
going
to
cost
a
million
dollars
and
if
they
try
that
case,
there
are
going
to
be
other
cases
that
they
won't
be
able
to
try.
the
plea
is
rejected,
the
case
is
tried,
and
then
afterwards
the
--
the
remedy
is
to
--
to
--
to
reinstate
this
plea
offer,
which
was
predicated
on
the
relieving
the
prosecutor
of
the
burden
of
having
to
try
that
case.
