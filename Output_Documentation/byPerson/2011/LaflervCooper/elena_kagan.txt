justice
elena
kagan
could
i
--
can
i
stop
you
on
the
first?
you
say
mere
outcome
is
not
enough,
reliability
of
the
proceedings.
how
does
that
fit
with
kimmelman,
where
we
said
it,
the
right
to
effective
assistance,
does
attach
to
suppression
hearings,
obviously
where
evidence
would
not
make
the
proceedings
more
reliable?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
thought
that
the
second
part
of
the
test
asked
about
harm.
and
here
the
person
is
sitting
in
prison
for
three
times
as
long
as
he
would
have
been
sitting
in
prison
had
he
had
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
plea
bargaining
stage.
so
why
doesn't
that
just
meet
the
requirements
of
strickland,
both
deficiency
and
prejudice?
justice
elena
kagan
sounds
like
a
good
argument.
justice
elena
kagan
and
outcome
--
there
is
a
different
outcome
here.
he
is
sitting
in
prison
three
times
as
long.
that's
a
different
outcome.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
take
the
sentencing
cases.
the
sentencing
cases,
the
determination
of
guilt
is
over
and
the
question
is,
is
this
person
sitting
in
jail
for
one
day
longer
because
his
counsel
was
ineffective?
and
if
he
is
we
would
find
prejudice
there.
so
why
isn't
the
same
thing
true
here?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
that
answer,
because
that
answer
seems
to
suggest
that
the
assistance
being
provided
was
not
ineffective.
but
here,
as
justice
ginsburg
notes,
you've
conceded
that
the
assistance
is
ineffective.
that
assistance
has
led
to
a
much,
much,
much
longer
sentence.
as
opposed
to
some
of
the
sentencing
cases
suggest
that
24
hours
is
enough,
this
is
10
years
or
something;
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
game,
no?
justice
elena
kagan
i
take
it,
then,
mr.
bursch,
you
would
have
the
same
answer
if
the
state
had
never
provided
counsel
at
all.
so
long
as
--
if
the
plea
negotiations
were
all
done
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
individual
defendant,
and
the
state
refused
to
provide
the
individual
defendant
with
counsel,
but
so
long
as
the
person
in
the
end
decided,
oh,
i
don't
like
this
plea,
i'll
go
to
trial,
then
it's
all
fine
and
dandy
under
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
jay,
you
don't
contest
that
plea
bargaining
is
a
critical
phase,
entitling
somebody
to
a
lawyer
and
to
an
effective
lawyer,
do
you.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
because
we
have
said
that
many
times,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
what
we
have
to
recognize
--
is
that
plea
bargaining
is
a
critical
phase
because
about
98
percent
of
the
action
of
the
criminal
justice
system
occurs
in
plea
bargaining.
and
to
deprive
somebody
of
a
lawyer
at
that
stage
of
the
process,
where
98
percent
of
the
action
occurs,
is
inconsistent
with
the
sixth
amendment.
that's
what
we've
said.
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
so
it's
not
a
critical
phase.
it's
only
a
critical
phase
depending
on
the
outcome
of
what
happens
at
that
phase?
justice
elena
kagan
has
--
have
you
ever
seen
a
critical
phase
before
in
our
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
where
the
right
to
a
lawyer
depends
upon
what
happens
during
that
critical
phase,
where
if
one
outcome
results
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
right,
but
if
another
outcome
results
there
is?
justice
elena
kagan
and
most
of
the
circuits
follow
your
rule,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
and
the
flood
gates
have
not
opened.
justice
elena
kagan
go
ahead.
justice
elena
kagan
and
perhaps
the
lack
of
unanimity
on
the
remedy
question
is
appropriate.
i
mean
people
have
been
trying
to
suggest
different
remedies.
but
perhaps
one
way
to
deal
with
the
remedy
question
is
to
recognize
that
these
cases
present
very
different
factual
circumstances,
that
there
is
a
lot
of
variation
in
them.
and
to
give
a
substantial
amount
of
discretion
to
the
lower
courts
to
work
out
what
the
best
remedy
is,
consistent
with
that
factual
variation.
justice
elena
kagan
the
second
case
on
these
issues
is
lafler
versus
cooper.
respondent
anthony
cooper
was
charged
with
five
crimes,
including
assault
with
intent
to
murder
and
all
of
those
crimes
arose
out
of
a
single
incident
where
he
shot
and
wounded
the
victim.
before
trial,
the
prosecution
offered
to
dismiss
two
of
the
charges
and
to
recommend
a
sentence
of
51
to
85
months
imprisonment,
and
that
would
all
be
in
return
for
cooperâ€™s
guilty
plea
to
two
other
charges.
cooper
ultimately
rejected
the
plea
offer.
he
now
alleges
that
his
attorney
convinced
him
wrongly
that
the
prosecution
would
be
unable
to
establish
the
intent
to
murder
the
victim
because
the
shots
had
hit
her
below
the
waist.
the
prosecution
made
a
second
and
less
favorable
plea
offer
on
the
first
day
of
trial,
and
cooper
again
rejected
it.
the
--
they
went
to
trial.
cooper
was
convicted
by
a
jury
on
all
counts
and
received
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
185
to
365
months
imprisonment.
it's
substantially
higher
than
what
he
would
have
received
had
he
accepted
the
plea
bargain.
after
the
admission
in
the
court's
denied
relief
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
respondent
filed
a
petition
for
federal
habeas
relief.
the
federal
district
court
found
respondent's
counsel
had
been
ineffective.
it
granted
a
conditional
writ,
ordering
specific
performance
of
the
original
plea
agreement
containing
the
51
to
85
months
sentence.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
for
the
reasons
set
forth,
the
court
now
vacates
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
as
the
court
makes
clear
today
in
frye,
the
case
just
announced,
defendants
have
a
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsels
during
the
plea
bargaining
process.
this
case
comes
here
with
a
concession
by
all
parties
that
respondent's
attorneys
--
the
respondent's
attorney,
his
performance
was
deficient.
today,
the
court
holds
that
for
a
defendant
who
claims
that
ineffective
assistance
led
him
to
turn
down
a
plea
officer
--
offer
and
as
a
result,
receives
a
more
severe
sentence
after
trial,
the
defendant
must
show
the
following.
he
must
show
that
but
for
the
ineffective
assistance
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
he
would
have
accepted
the
plea
and
that
the
prosecutor
would
not
have
withdrawn
it.
he
must
show
that
the
court
would
have
accepted
the
plea
and
he
must
show
that
the
conviction
and
sentence
under
the
plea
would
have
been
less
severe
than
none
of
the
judgment
and
sentence
imposed
after
the
trial.
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states,
as
amicus,
propose
a
more
narrow
view
of
the
sixth
amendment.
they
contend
they
cannot
be
prejudiced
under
strickland
one
arising
out
of
--
of
--
out
of
plea
negotiations
if
the
defendant
is
later
convicted
at
a
fair
trial.
the
court
rejects
this
view.
first,
that
contention
ignores
the
fact
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
protect
just
the
trial
itself,
it
applies
to
all
critical
stages
of
the
criminal
proceedings.
this
court
has
not
said
that
errors
occurring
before
trial
are
always
remedied
by
an
otherwise
fair
trial.
here,
as
a
result
of
ineffective
advice,
respondent
went
to
trial
and
received
a
sentence
three-and-a-half
times
more
severe
that
he
would
have
received
by
pleading
guilty.
second,
while
defendants
have
no
constitutional
right
to
accept
the
plea
offer
and
no
right
that
a
judge
accept
the
plea,
when
their
offer
is
in
fact
made
they
do
have
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
when
considering
it.
third,
the
sixth
amendment
is
concerned
not
only
with
the
reliability
of
the
conviction,
but
also
with
the
fairness
and
the
regularity
of
the
processes
that
preceded
it.
a
blanket
rule
that
a
trial
wipes
clean
any
deficient
performance
during
the
plea
bargaining
process
is
inconsistent
with
the
reality
of
the
plea
bargaining
process
and
with
sixth
amendment
principles.
those
principles
are
consistent
with
the
test
that
has
been
adopted
by
appellate
courts
now
for
over
30
years
without
demonstrated
difficulties
or
systemic
disruptions.
there
remains
the
question
of
an
appropriate
remedy.
the
court
discusses
this
question
in
more
detail
and
in
the
opinion.
in
circumstances
like
this
case,
the
proper
remedy
may
be
for
the
judge
to
require
the
prosecution
to
re-offer
the
plea
and
then
to
exercise
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
vacate
the
conviction
from
trial
or
lead
the
conviction
undisturbed.
as
a
remedy
here,
the
state
court
should
exercise
its
discretion
in
determining
whether
to
sentence
respondent
pursuant
to
the
plea
agreement,
vacate
only
some
of
the
convictions
from
trial
or
leave
the
convictions
and
sentence
from
the
trial
undisturbed
and
these
matters
should
be
explored
in
further
state
proceedings.
therefore,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
vacated.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
thomas
joins
and
the
chief
justice
joins
except
as
to
part
iv.
justice
alito
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
