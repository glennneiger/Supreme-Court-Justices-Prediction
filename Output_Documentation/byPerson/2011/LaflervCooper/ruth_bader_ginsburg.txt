when
you
say
no
violation,
you
don't
mean
that
there
was
no
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
i
thought
that
was
conceded,
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
defective
advice
causes
the
defendant
to
enter
a
plea
that
he
would
not
have
entered
if
he
had
been
properly
advised.
can
he
get
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
explain
why
defective
advice
causing
a
plea,
that
qualifies,
but
defective
advice
causing
defendant
to
turn
down
a
plea--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it's
not
--
that
he
got
ineffective
assistance,
yes,
that
is
not
controverted.
but
that
he
would
have
gotten
the
51
months
or
68
is
certainly
controverted
because
of
two
interventions:
the
prosecutor
can
say
no
deal;
i'm
withdrawing
it,
even
after
an
initial
acceptance;
and
the
judge
can
say,
i
think
51
to
68
is
entirely
improper
for
what
this
man
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
judge
--
the
judge,
he
knows
what
the
plea
--
let's
say
he
knows
what
the
plea
bargain
was,
but
he
also
knows
that
for
one
of
the
crimes,
felon
in
possession,
that
alone,
the
sentencing
range
is
81
to
135.
so
without
any,
considering
anything
that
happened
at
trial,
the
judge
knows
that
the
plea
bargain
was
for
less
than
if
the
man
had
been
charged
with
--
only
with
a
felon
in
possession.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
--
it
seems
most
unlikely
that
a
judge
would
have
accepted
the
plea
bargaining
for
51
to
68
for
the
crimes
that
were
charged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
may
be,
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
sentence
range
was
81
through
135
for
felon
in
possession?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unanimity
on
the
remedy?
here
the
court
said
that
the
writ
shall
be
granted
conditioned
on
the
state
taking
action
to
offer
the
51
to
85
months
plea.
so
that
doesn't
bind
the
judge,
but
it
does
bind
the
prosecutor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
removes
the
possibility
of
the
prosecutor
saying,
"i
would
have
withdrawn
that
initial
offer.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
prosecutor
--
the
remedy
is
--
is
that
the
remedy
that's
uniform?
that
the
prosecutor
has
no
discretion,
only
the
judge
does?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
conceded
--
you
conceded
he
had
a
fair
trial.
that's
not
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
can't
be
a
charade
and
still
be
fair.
