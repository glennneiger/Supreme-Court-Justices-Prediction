justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge,
though,
that
it's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
if
you're
--
well,
no,
i
guess
you
haven't
acknowledged.
let
me
ask
you:
have
you
provided
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
if
you
are
a
lousy
bargainer?
you
are
just
no
good
at
the
--
you
know;
i
don't
know
--
the
game
of
bargaining.
and
so
you
do
a
bad
job
in
bargaining
down
the
sentence,
i
mean
a
notoriously
bad
job.
is
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
even
agree
with
the
first
part.
i
don't
think
our
legal
process
is
--
is
a
bargaining
game.
it
shouldn't
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
difference
--
that's
not
the
difference
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
the
difference
is
when
you
plead
guilty
you
deprive
yourself
of
the
24-karat
test
of
fairness,
which
is
trial
by
jury
before
nine
people
who
have
to
find
you
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
when
you
plead
guilty,
you
give
up
that.
when
you
don't
plead
guilty
you
get
what
is
the
best
thing
in
our
legal
system.
you
can't
do
any
better
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
position
is
you
are
entitled
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
before
you
plead
guilty,
but
you
are
not
entitled
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
evaluating
plea
offers?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jay,
you
disagree
with
the
assertion
that
justice
breyer
made
that
this
was
unfair.
this
man
deserved
to
get
the
sentence
he
got,
didn't
he?
he
had
a
full
and
fair
trial.
a
jury
of
12
people,
finding
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
determined
that
he
deserved
that
sentence.
how
could
it
be
unfair
to
give
him
the
sentence
that
he
deserved?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jay,
couldn't
--
couldn't
it
be
said
that
what
our
cases
hold
is
that
pleading
guilty
is
a
critical
phase.
would
that
be
enough
to
explain
our
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
--
what
if
he
turns
it
down,
ms.
newman.
he
says,
no,
i
can't
accept
this.
what
happens
then?
he
had
a
new--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah,
the
judge.
it
goes
back
to
the
judge.
we
agree
with
you
and
we
send
it
back
to
the
judge.
we
reinstate
the
offer,
okay.
he
accepts
the
offer
and
it
goes
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
says,
no,
this
is
outrageous.
no,
i'm
not
going
to
approve
of
this
plea
bargain.
what
happens
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
would
have
a
new
trial,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
if
the
judge
turns
it
down,
then
the
prior
trial
is
valid,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
both
can't
be
perfect.
either
he
has
another
trial,
although
he's
just
been
found
guilty
by
a
jury
of
12,
with
an
entirely
fair
proceeding
or
else
he
doesn't
have
a
new
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
what.
what
factual
variation
do
you
think
justifies
a
categorically
different
remedy.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
some
of
the
remedies
are
good
and
some
are
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
factual
--
i
mean,
give
me
an
example
of
the
different
remedies
and
how
a
certain
fact
situation
could
make
one
okay
and
the
other
not
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
why
was
that
okay
there?
why
was
that
okay
there?
what
factual
circumstances
made
that
okay
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
--
don't
blame
it
on
me.
[laughter]
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
it's
your
suggestion
that
we
set
aside
a
perfectly
fair
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
just
a
hypothetical.
if
you
are
going
to
set
it
aside--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
you
should
put
it
back
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
no
prejudice
unless
he
would
have
accepted
the
deal.
how
are
you
going
to
know
that
he
would
have?
of
course
he
is
going
to
say
he
that
would
have,
but
how
is
a
trial
judge
going
to
make
a
credibility
determination
on
that
--
on
that
issue?
i
guess
it's
just
a
credibility
determination.
i
don't
know
how
he's
going
to
do
it.
i
think
you
can
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
you
heard,
i
filed
a
dissent
in
each
of
these
cases.
in
missouri
versus
frye,
the
chief
justice
and
justices
thomas
and
alito
have
joined
my
dissent.
in
lafler,
justice
thomas
has
joined
in
full
and
the
chief
justice
has
joined
all
but
one
part.
i
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
figure
out
which
of
my
following
comments
have
been
joined
by
whom,
lest
i
put
words
in
other
people
mouths,
you
can
assume
i
speak
only
for
myself
and
justice
thomas.
let
me
begin
with
our
prior
case
law
to
which
the
majority
opinions
today
claimed
to
be
faithful.
for
nearly
three
decades,
ever
since
we
decided
the
seminal
case
of
strickland
versus
washington
dealing
within
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
we
have
explained
that
the
ultimate
focus,
â€œthe
ultimate
focus"
in
any
ineffective
assistance
case
must
be
"the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceeding
whose
result
is
being
challenged".
the
test
was
not
whether
the
result
would
have
been
different
but
for
the
ineffective
assistance,
but
whether
the
in
effective
assistance
destroyed
the
fairness
of
the
conviction.
thus
in
a
case
called
lockhart
versus
fretwell,
decided
in
1993,
counsel
had
failed
to
make
an
objection
which
under
the
then
current
law
pronounced
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
compelled
the
trial
court
to
give
the
defendant
a
life
sentence
instead
of
the
death
sentence
that
he,
in
fact,
received.
we
nonetheless
found
no
ineffective
assistance
in
the
constitutional
sense
because
that
case
from
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
had
later
been
reversed
by
this
court.
so,
even
though
counsel's
error
deprived
the
defendant
of
a
life
sentence,
that's
what
he
would
have
gotten.
it
did
not
deprive
him
of
a
fair
trial.
today's
opinion
changes
that.
there
is
not
doubt
that
the
defendants
in
these
cases
were
convicted
and
sentenced
pursuant
to
fair
and
constitutionally
valid
procedures.
one
of
them
got
the
gold
standard
of
american
justice,
a
full-dress
jury
trial
before
12
men
and
women
tried
and
true,
who
unanimously
found
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
other
defendant
confessed
his
guilt
after
a
judicial
proceeding
that
assured
his
confession
was
voluntary
and
true.
they
are
both
without
a
doubt
guilty,
they
do
not
claim
otherwise,
and
have
been
a
judge
so
and
sentenced
by
the
fairest
of
procedures.
what
they
claim
in
this
appeal
is
that
they
should
not
have
had
to
suffer
fair
conviction
and
sentence
because
it
was
only
mistake
of
counsel
that
deprived
them
of
a
better
plea
deal,
a
few
words
about
plea
bargaining.
in
many,
perhaps
most
countries
of
the
world,
american
style
plea
bargaining,
at
least
in
cases
such
as
serious
as
these,
is
forbidden,
even
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
testimony
that
enables
conviction
of
a
greater
malefactor,
much
less
simply
to
save
the
state
the
expense
of
trial.
in
europe,
many
countries
adhere
to
what
they
call
the
"legality
principle"
which
requires
prosecutors
to
charge
all
offenses
they
believe
they
can
prove.
in
the
united
states,
of
course,
we
have
plea
bargaining
a
plenty,
but
until
today,
we
have
regarded
it
as
a
necessary
evil.
sure,
it
causes
some
people
to
plead
guilty
to
offenses
they
are
really
not
guilty
of
simply
to
avoid
the
enormous
expense
and
the
risk
of
being
tried
for
higher
offenses
and
sure,
it
causes
a
lot
of
guilty
defendants,
perhaps
most
of
them,
to
get
off
with
a
less
punishment
than
the
law
says
they
deserve.
even
so,
we
accept
it
because
many
believe
that
without
plea
bargaining,
our
long
and
expensive
process
of
criminal
trial
could
not
sustain
the
burden
imposed
on
it
and
our
system
of
criminal
justice
would
grind
to
a
halt.
but
until
today,
no
one
has
thought
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
plea
bargain,
a
constitutional
right
not
to
plead
guilty
on
the
basis
of
bad
advice,
yes,
because
pleading
guilty
deprives
a
defendant
of
a
fair
trial
but
not
a
constitutional
right
to
plea
bargain.
in
all
states
and
the
federal
government,
the
prosecution
does
not
have
to
offer
a
plea
bargain.
the
prosecution
can
withdraw
it
until
it
is
accepted
and
even
after
it
has
been
accepted,
the
judge
can
refuse
to
approve
it.
in
some
states,
including
missouri,
the
state
involved
in
frye,
the
plea
offer
can
be
withdrawn
by
the
prosecution
even
after
the
defendant
has
accepted
it,
right
up
until
the
time
that
the
judge
approves
it
and
accepts
the
defendant's
guilty
plea.
after
today,
however,
plea
bargaining
is
no
longer
a
somewhat
embarrassing
adjunct
to
our
criminal
justice
system.
the
court
says,
quoting
approvingly
from
a
law
review
article,
"it
is
the
criminal
justice
system."
and
since
it
is,
defendants
are
entitled,
constitutionally
entitled
to
have
counsels
who
are
effective
plea
bargainers,
not
in
order
to
assure
that
the
defendants
get
a
fair
trial
but
in
order
to
assure
that
they
have
a
fair
chance
to
escape
a
fair
trial
and
get
less
punishment
than
they
deserve.
the
court
today
embraces
the
sporting
chance
theory
of
criminal
law
in
which
the
state
functions
like
a
conscientious
casino
operator,
giving
each
player
a
fair
chance
to
beat
the
house,
that
is,
to
serve
less
time
than
the
law
says
he
deserves
and
when
a
player
is
excluded
from
the
tables,
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
today's
opinions
open
a
whole
new
field
of
constitutionalized
criminal
procedure,
the
field
of
plea
bargaining
law.
the
court
announces
this
new
field
in
opinions
that
almost
seem
designed
to
sow
confusion.
today's
decision
--
decisions
deal
with
only
a
few
aspects
of
constitutional
plea
bargaining
law,
attorney'
failure
to
pass
along
a
plea
offer
and
attorney
failure
to
counsel
acceptance
of
a
plea
offer
because
of
mistake
regarding
what
their
prosecution
would
have
to
prove
at
trial.
what
other
counsel
bargaining
inadequacies
might
there
be?
the
court
does
not
say,
though
it
acknowledges
that
that
is
a
difficult
question
and,
of
course,
if
plea
bargaining
is
the
criminal
justice
system,
the
prosecution
must
have
some
responsibilities
as
well.
must
it
leave
a
plea
offer
open
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
so
that
the
defendant
can
ponder
it?
is
the
rule
that
a
plea
offer
can
be
withdrawn
at
anytime
before
the
court
accepts
the
plea
even
after
the
defendant
has
accepted
it?
is
that
rule
now
unconstitutional?
the
court
leaves
all
this
to
be
worked
out
in
further
litigation,
which
you
can
be
sure
there
will
be
plenty
of.
perhaps
the
most
perplexing
aspect
of
today's
opinions
is
the
majority's
discussion
of
the
appropriate
remedy
for
violations
of
its
newly
discovered
constitutional
right.
in
lafler,
the
court
requires
the
state
to
reoffer
the
plea
agreement
that
was
rejected
because
of
counsel's
bad
advice.
that
just
turns
out
to
be
meaningless
however
because
according
to
the
court,
"the
state
trial
court
can
then
exercise
its
discretion
in
determining
whether
to
vacate
the
convictions
and
resentence
respondent
pursuant
to
the
plea
agreement,
to
vacate
only
some
of
the
convictions
and
resentence
respondent
accordingly
or
to
leave
the
convictions
and
sentence
from
trial
undisturbed."
that
is
nothing
short
of
extraordinary.
nowhere
in
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
have
we
ever
suggested
that
the
remedy
for
an
unconstitutional
conviction,
which
this
is
said
to
be,
could
be
entirely
subject
to
the
trial
court's
discretion
or
that
the
remedy
could
ever
be
no
remedy
at
all.
there
are
other
things
wrong
with
these
opinions.
in
the
frye
case,
whether
the
defendant
suffered
any
prejudice
from
his
attorney's
failure
to
inform
him
of
the
plea
offer
depends
on,
one,
whether
he
would
have
accepted
the
plea
offer,
two,
whether
the
prosecution
would
have
withdrawn
it,
as
--
as
the
missouri
law
allows
and
three,
whether
the
trial
judge
would
have
approved
it.
all
of
these
woulders
are
purely
speculative.
on
remand,
the
court
is
to
determine
prejudice
by
a
process
of
retrospective
crystal
ball
gazing
posing
as
legal
analysis.
as
for
the
lafler
case,
that
is
here
on
federal
habeas
corpus
and
congress
has
passed
a
law
that
says
we
cannot
reverse
a
state
court
decision
on
federal
habeas
unless
it
violated
clearly
established
federal
law.
no
one
could
possibly
think
that
a
constitutional
right
to
plea
bargain
was
clearly
established
federal
law.
perhaps,
the
plea
bargaining
process
is
a
subject
worthy
of
regulation,
but
it
happens
not
to
be
a
process
regulated
by
the
constitution,
which
is
not
a
judicial
cure-all
for
all
of
society's
problems.
the
sixth
amendment
is
concerned
not
with
the
fairness
of
bargaining,
but
with
the
fairness
of
conviction.
in
today's
cases,
the
court's
zeal
to
bring
perfection
to
everything
requires
a
reversal
of
perfectly
valid,
eminently
just
convictions.
it
is
not
wise,
it
is
not
right.
