justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
isn't
there
a
right
to
make
a
critical
decision
on
whether
to
accept
or
reject
a
plea
bargain,
once
offered?
there
is
no
right
to
demand
one
or
to
keep
it,
but
isn't
there
a
right
to
make
that
kind
of
critical
decision?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can
--
you
can
agree
with
that
when
95
percent
of
the
criminal
cases
are
disposed
of
by
way
of
bargaining?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
can
you
talk
about
the
reliability
of
a
process
or
its
fairness
when
you
have
an
attorney
who
has
fundamentally
misgauged
the
law?
how
can
a
trial
be
fair
when
the
attorney
is
going
into
a
trial
thinking
his
client
can't
be
convicted
because
the
shots
fired
hit
below
the
waist?
so
how
can
that
kind
of
trial
ever
be
fair?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
justice
breyer
permits
me
to
add
an
addendum
to
give
the
reasons
why
i
might
agree
with
him,
or
a
way
of
viewing
this,
as
i
read
the
lower
court's
decisions,
they
said
there
wasn't
ineffectiveness,
because
he
was
just
trying
to
get
a
better
deal.
and
i
think
that,
translating
what
he
said,
the
very
reasonable
view
by
the
court
was,
the
prosecutor
may
think
of
a
lesser
charge,
because
if
this
guy
really
wanted
to
kill
this
woman
he
would
have
hit
her
head
or
her
chest,
but
he
aimed
low,
so
he
was
really
just
angry
and
shooting
enough
so
that
if
he
hit
her,
okay,
if
she
died,
okay.
but
he
really
didn't
have
that
heinous
intent
to
execute
a
gunshot
to
the
brain.
and
so
he
was
hoping
to
negotiate
something
better.
if
that's
--
and
justice
breyer's
shaking
his
head.
if
that
in
fact,
if
this
is
an
aedpa
case,
and
we
have
to
give
deference
to
the
state
courts,
doesn't
that
resolve
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
have
to
give
deference
to
their
finding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you
are
begging
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay?
because
yes,
i
think
justice
breyer's
first
statement,
you
have
to
prove
the
guy
was
going
to
take
the
plea,
because
there
is
no
sense
in
--
in
giving
him
a
remedy
that
he
would
have
never
sought.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right?
but
it
goes
back
to,
i
think
it
was
justice
alito
or
chief
--
or
the
chief
justice's
question
of
on
what
basis
can
the
judge
reject
the
plea?
you
have
said
earlier
that
he
has
to
put
aside
any
information
he
learned
during
the
trial,
and
that's
really
the
nub
of
this
case.
what
are
the
grounds
that
you
are
proposing
the
judge
can
use
to
reject
the
plea?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
what
was
the
defense
at
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
the
defense
at
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
he
deny
having
committed
the
act
of
the
shooting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
the
case
that
in
most
of
the
cases
in
which
motions
of
this
kind
are
brought
to
trial
judges
if
there
is
a
defense
of
mistaken
identity
or
of
"i
didn't
do
it",
that
judges
often
find
the
defendant
has
not
proven
that
they
would
have
taken
the
plea?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
most
cases
in
which
a
trial
is
had,
where
the
defendant
is
pleading
misidentification
or:
i
just
didn't
do
this
act.
in
those
cases,
do
most
of
the
trial
judges
not
permit
or
don't
find
that
the
defendant
has
met
their
burden
of
proving
that
he
or
she
would
have
taken
the
plea?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
of
this
case,
and
you
can
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
that
your
client
told
the
attorney
from
the
beginning:
i
did
it;
i
want
to
plea.
