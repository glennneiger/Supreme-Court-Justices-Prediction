chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-209,
lafler
v.
cooper.
mr.
bursch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"sacred"
is
a
little
strong,
don't
you
think?
i
mean,
it
is
a,
to
some
extent,
unfair
to
the
prosecutor
because
he
knows
already
he's
got
a
guilty
verdict
in
his
pocket
and
he
has
to
go
back.
but
why
is
it
so
terribly
difficult
to
tell
the
defendant
he
has
a
right
to
accept
that
offer
if
he
wants,
but
then
go
through
the
normal
process,
which
is
it
has
to
be
approved
by
a
judge
and
all
that
stuff?
i
don't
see
what's
terribly
difficult
about
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
newman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
earlier
that
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
judge,
still
retains
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
approve
the
plea
bargain,
right,
whether
to
accept
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes
--
well,
which
is
it,
the
bargain
or
the
sentence?
it
includes
the
sentence,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
has
discretion
--
he
has
discretion.
so
is
he
allowed
to
take
into
consideration
all
that's
happened
before,
not
just
with
respect
to
guilt
or
innocence
or
the
result
of
the
trial,
but
in
imposing
the
sentence
or
approving
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
nothing
that
he
learned
at
trial,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
deficient
performance--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
how
are
you
ever
going
to
know
that
the
defendant
would
have
accepted
the
plea
agreement?
because
by
not
accepting
it
he
has
a
chance
of
going
scot-free.
he's
going
to
have
a
fair
trial,
that's
the
assumption;
and
he
may
be
acquitted.
so
how
is
a
judge
supposed
to
say
--
i
mean,
presumably
the
defendant
will
always
say,
i
would
have
taken
that
deal,
because
it's
better.
so
how
is
a
judge
supposed
to
go
back
and
decide
whether
that's
true
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
the
judge
--
how
is
the
judge
ever
going
to
know,
be
able
to
decide
whether
the
defendant
would
have
accepted
the
deal
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
defendant's
choice,
not
the
lawyer's
choice.
it's
the
defendant's
choice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
effectiveness
question.
i
understand
that
to
be
taken
out
of
the
case
by
the
concessions
on
the
other
side.
i'm
talking
about
the
prejudice
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
a
judge
supposed
to
know?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
people
have
different
--
some
people
are
willing
to
take
the
chance.
okay?
let's
say
the
there
is
a
20
percent
chance
that
the
person
will
be
found
guilty.
some
people
will
say,
i'm
willing
to
take
that
chance
because
i
just
don't
want
the
chance
of
--
of
going
to
jail.
i
am
willing
to
roll
the
dice.
other
people
will
say
no,
that's
too
much.
whether
you
want
to
go
to
jail
may
cut
one
way
or
the
other,
but
how
is
a
judge
supposed
to
decide?
ask
him,
are
you
--
do
you
take
chances?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
judge
should
decide
whether
he
would
take
the
deal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
look
at
the
evidence
before
him
and
say,
boy,
i
would
take
that
deal.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
but
you
can
never
say
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
acquittal.
juries
can
decide
not
to
convict
no
matter
what
the
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
up
to
the
jury.
it's
not
up
to
us
ex
ante
to
decide
this
guy
is
definitely
going
to
lose,
so
let's
not
waste
our
time.
juries
--
i
don't
want
to
say
often
but
it
is
not
--
it's
certainly
not
inconceivable
that
the
a
may
decide
for
whatever
reason
we
are
not
going
to
convict
this
guy.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
that
--
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
your
point.
you
said
there
was
no
defense.
does
that
mean
you
didn't
--
he
had
a
frivolous
defense
or
that
he
literally
did
not
put
on
a
defense,
just
said:
just
this
state
has
to
prove
the
case
and
they
haven't
done
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
he--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--something
the
jury
could
have
accepted,
right?
even
if
it's
not
legally
true
that
if
you
shoot
him
at
the
--
the
person
below
the
waist,
that's
not
a
defense,
but
i
can
see
a
reasonable
juror
saying
he
probably
didn't
intend
to
kill
her.
he
shot
her
below
the
waist.
maybe
that
is
not
such
a
bad
strategy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bursch,
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
