ms.
valerie
r.
newman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
uncontroverted
here
that
anthony
cooper
received
incompetent
advice
from
his
counsel.
it
is
uncontroverted
here
that
as
a
result
of
that
incompetent
advice
mr.
cooper
is
serving
between
100
and
134
months
of
extra
time
of
imprisonment.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
those
are
both
true,
justice
ginsburg
--
justice
ginsburg,
but
however
the
strickland
test
requires
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
result.
and
on
this
record,
we
have
no
reasonable
probability
--
we
have
no
reason
to
expect
that
that's
not
exactly
what
would
have
happened.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
yes.
we
evaluate
the
case,
and
the
strickland
analysis
is
an
imperfect
--
the
strickland
remedy
is
an
imperfect
remedy.
it
has
always
been
an
imperfect
remedy.
it
will
always
be
an
imperfect
remedy.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
this
court
has
stated
numerous
times
that
it
presumes
a
conscientious
decisionmaker,
and
a
conscientious
decisionmaker
would
put--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--you
would
evaluate
the
case
as
you
would
have
evaluated
it
at
the
time
of
the
proceedings.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
yes,
because
the
deficient
--
you
evaluate
things
at
the
point
of
the
deficient
performance.
and
at
the
point
of
the
deficient
performance,
the
judge
had
a
certain
amount
of
information
before
him,
the
prosecutor
had
a
certain
amount
of
information
before
him,
and
the
defense
attorney
had
a
certain
amount
of
information--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
in
that
case--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--yes,
because
what
happens
in
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
is
the
state
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
unconstitutionality.
and
so
that
is
a
price
that
this
court
has
said
the
state
will
bear
when
there
is
--
when
there
is
a
constitutional
violation,
because
there
is
no
perfect--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--yes,
that's
accurate.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
no,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
in
this
court
and
i
can
represent
to
the
court
in
my
practice
before
this
court,
which
i
have
practiced
before
this
court
for
many,
many
years,
this
plea
bargain
was
an
ordinary
plea
bargain.
this
was
not
anything
extraordinary.
it
was
very
run
of
the
mill.
it
was
--
it
was
a
run
of
the
mill
case--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i
did
not
--
typically,
you
only
score
out
the
guidelines
for
the
most
serious
offense.
so
the
guidelines
may
have
been
high
for
the
felon
in
possession
offense,
but
however
the
judge
--
in
fashioning
the
remedy,
you
are
not
going
to
--
this
court
would
not
take
discretion
away
from
the
judge.
so
in
fashioning
the
remedy,
in
adopting
the
remedy
of
the
sixth
circuit
if
this
court
were
to
do
that,
this
case
would
go
back
before
this
same
judge
if
he's
still
on
the
bench,
and
it
would
be
--
would
put
people
back
--
mr.
cooper
would
accept
the
plea,
but
if
--
the
judge
retained
sentencing
discretion.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
right.
you
can't
find--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--no.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
you
do
have
to
give
deference
to
their
finding,
there
is
no
question
under
aedpa
there
is
deference.
and
there
is
actually
no
question,
there
is
sort
of
a
doubly
deferential
review,
given
the
strickland
analysis.
however,
the
state
courts
did
not
decide
this
case
on
sixth
amendment
grounds,
so
there
is
nothing
to
give
deference
to.
the
state
courts
decided
this
and
the
trial
court
said
mr.
cooper
made
his
own
choices.
that
is
not
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
analysis.
the
court
of
appeals
in
michigan
also
did
not
engage
in
a
sixth
amendment
analysis.
they
adopted
the
trial
court
and
said
that
mr.
cooper
made
his
own
choices.
so
there
is
--
and
this
claim
was
raised
specifically
on
sixth
amendment
grounds
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
appeal
until
it
reached
this
court.
so
there
is
no
aedpa
deference
to
give
to
the
state
court's
decision.
there
is
no
question
as
well
that
it
was
ineffective
assistance,
because
the
state
court
record
does
not
bear
out
that
mr.
mcclain
was
trying
to
get
a
better
deal.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
the
sentencing.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
it's
a
sentence
recommendation
and
under
michigan
law
the
judge
cannot--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
he
can
take
into
account
anything
that
he
could
have
taken
into
account
in
the
first
place.
but
in
this
case--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i
would
argue
no.
i
mean,
certainly
the
court
will
set
the
parameters
of--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i
would
say
there
is
not
an
option
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
so
the
judge--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
in
that
case,
the
case
would
proceed
under
michigan
law.
in
that
case
the
judge--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--no.
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
acceptable
to
say
that
a
new
trial
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy
in
this
case,
because
he
had
a
trial.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
it
would
depend
on
the
reasons
why
the
judge
would
turn
it
down.
if
would
have
to
be
a
legitimate
reason
under
a
state
law,
otherwise
there
would--
justice
scalia.
yeah.
then
the
prior
trial
is
okay?
not
that
it's
okay,
but
i
think
under
imperfect
circumstances
it's
the
result
that
we're--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--right.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
that's
also
a
perfectly
acceptable
--
that's
also
a
perfectly
acceptable
remedy.
the
purpose
--
the
reason--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--okay.
[laughter]
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
no.
the
bar
on
habeas
--
well
the
bar
on
strickland,
even
not
on
habeas,
is
a
very
high
bar,
as
this
court
said
in
padilla.
and
it's
not
a
bar
that
can
often
be
met.
and
so
you
have
to
show
under
a
strickland
analysis
deficient
performance
and
prejudice.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i
think
it
would
be
much
more
difficult,
because
this
court
on
habeas
review
and
state
courts
on
non-habeas
review
are
very
deferential
to
strategic
decisions.
almost
anything
that
qualifies--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
we
have
had
strickland
that
held
jurisprudence
for
three
decades.
there
was
a
flood
gates
argument
when
hill
was
decided
that
we
are
going
to
have
all
these
people
--
that
we
--
and
we
have
had
since
mcmahon
v.
richardson,
this
court
saying
plea
bargaining
is
a
critical
stage.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
right.
we
already
had
unanimity--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
yes,
we
have
unanimity
in
the
federal
circuits
and
we
have
--
almost
every
state
that
has
addressed
this
issue
has
addressed
it
in
the
same
manner.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
the
remedies
vary.
when
i
said
unanimity,
i
didn't
mean
every
court
in
every
circuit
does
exact
--
handles
this
exactly
the
same
way.
unanimity
in
the
sense
that
every
federal
circuit
and
almost
every
state
that
has
addressed
this
issue,
and
they
have
addressed
this
issue
for
over
30
years,
has
found
that
there
is
a
cognizable
sixth
amendment
violation
that
can
be
remedied
on
appeal.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
absolutely.
and
it's
the
same
thing
the
courts
have
been
doing,
again,
since
strickland
and
hill
were
decided.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
even
in
the
two
cases
before
the
court
today.
i
mean,
in
mr.
frye's
case
he
accepted
a
plea
and
the
state
court
ordered
a
new
trial
as
a
remedy
for
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
violation.
in
my
case
and
mr.
cooper's
case--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--well,
that's
just
--
i
don't
know
that
the
factual
circumstances
make
it
okay,
but
it
was
the
remedy
that
the
state
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
it
was
a
remedy
that
the
state
ordered
and
in
this
case
it's
just
the
remedy
that
was
ordered
by
the
federal
court
was
a
remedy--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--these
cases
are
so
fact-specific,
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
evade
the
question
about
a
hypothetical,
but
there
--
every
case
is
so
fact-specific
that
i
think
there
--
the
possibility
exists
that
a
--
that--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--that's
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
in
--
in
mr.
cooper's
case
i
think
the
--
the
remedy
in
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
only
appropriate
remedy
that
--
that
puts
every
--
that
is
narrowly
tailored
to
the
sixth
amendment
violation,
and
that's
what
this
court
has
said.
i
mean,
this
court
has
given
direction
to
the
courts,
to
lower
courts
that
you
just
narrowly
tailor
the
remedy
to
fit
the
situation,
because
there
is
so
many
factual--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
i
--
i
believe
that
is
what
is
suggested.
and
i--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--right.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
again,
right.
it
is
going
to
depend
on
what
happens
--
happens
below,
and
that
--
we
don't
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
concept
here
is
one--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--okay.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
right.
absolutely.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
that
--
any
grounds
that
would
have
existed
in
the
original
circumstances.
so
if
the
judge
--
in
--
in
michigan
there
is
a
variety
of
reasons
why
a
judge
can
say
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
accept
this
sentencing
recommendation.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
always
--
in
large
part,
it's
not
going
to
depend
on
the
defendant,
it's
going
to
--
in
larger
part
it's
going
to
defend
on
--
depend
on
defense
counsel--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--in
making
that
determination,
because
strickland
always
looks
at
strategy.
i
mean
that
--
that's
the
underlying--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
yes
--
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
it
yes
or
no.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
the
same
way
that
--
that
trial
courts
decide
any
question
of
fact.
in
this
case
we
had
testimony
from
the
trial
attorney.
the
trial
attorney
told
the
judge,
i
told
him
not
to
accept
the
plea
because
he
legally
could
not
be
convicted
of
the
charge.
i
mean,
mr.
cooper--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--but
he
--
but
he
has
the
right
to
assistance
--
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
making
that
critical
choice,
and
he
didn't
have
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
--
mr.
cooper
wrote
letters
to
the
judge--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--correct.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
the
judge
looks
at
the
record
before
him.
so
in
this
case
we
had
mr.
cooper's
testimony--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--no,
by
--
by
looking
at
--
mr.
chief
justice,
by
looking
at
the
evidence
in
the
record
before
him.
in
this
case
mr.
cooper
wrote--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--no--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--no,
no
--
no,
no,
no.
mr.
--
mr.
cooper
wrote
two
letters
to
the
judge
saying
i
want
to
accept
a
plea.
mr.
mclean,
the
trial
attorney
who
provided
the
incompetent
advice,
told
the
judge
in
a
post-conviction
hearing
that
mr.
cooper
wanted
to
take
a
plea.
i
mean,
there
--
there
is
no
--
it
is
beyond
question
in
this
case.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
every
plea
bargain
is
predicated
on
relieving
the
prosecution
of
having
the
burden
of
--
of
trying
a
case.
i
mean,
the
key
here
is,
let's
get
back
to
what
strickland
stands
for
and
it's
the
unreliability
or
the
unfairness
of
the
proceedings.
it's
not
just
an
unreliability
determination.
so
in
this
case
mr.
cooper
had
two
choices.
he
could
take
a
certain
plea
with
almost
a
certain
sentence
or
he
could
have
a
--
really
what
was
a
charade
of
a
trial
because
his
attorney
told
him,
you
--
you
can't
be
convicted
of
this
offense;
you
will
not
be
convicted
of
this
offense
following
the
trial.
you
can
be
convicted
of
a
lesser--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i
didn't--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--it's
an
unfairness
of
the
entire
proceedings
that
were
presented.
all
right?
so
there
is
no
separate
habeas
claim
with
respect
to
the
trial,
but
the
--
but
reality
is
when
you
look
at
the
criminal
--
when
you
look
at
the
sixth
amendment,
it
talks
about
the
criminal--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i'm
saying
it's
unfair
to
go
to
trial
when
your
attorney
tells
you,
you
can't
be
convicted.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i'm--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i'm
saying
it's
unfair
to
say
that
the
trial
erases
the
unfairness
when
there
was
no
possibility
but
for
a
conviction
at
the
end
of
the
road.
so
this
was
a
certain
guilty
plea
or
this
was
a
--
wrong
guilty
plea
under
the
math
of
a
trial.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
there
was
no
defense.
i
mean,
there
was
no
possibility--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--that's
true,
but
in
this
case,
mr.
mclean
told
mr.
cooper
he
would
be
convicted.
i
mean,
he
assured
him
of
conviction.
he
said:
you
will
be
convicted
at
the
end
of
the
trial;
you're
just
going
to
be
convicted
of
a
lesser
offense.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i'm
sorry?
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
there
wasn't
--
there
was
no
defense
presented.
there
was
no
real
defense
presented
at
trial
because--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--never.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
no.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
i
didn't--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i
don't
know
that
the
cases
bear
out
that
if
you
have
a
valid
defense
it
would
be
harder.
but
i
would
agree
with
that
--
if
that's
a
hypothetical,
that
if
you
have
a
valid
defense,
it
would
be
a
lot
harder
to
be
in
this
position
of
showing
that
you
would
have
taken
the
plea.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
that
is
correct.
there
was
never
--
there
was
no
question
in
this
case
at
any
step,
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
and
there
was
no
--
never,
never
anything
from
the
trial
attorney
other
than
incompetent
advice.
he
never
went
to
trial
for
an
acquittal.
he
went
to
trial
because
he
believed
legally
his
client
would
be
convicted
of
a
lesser
offense
that
would
put
him
in
a
better
position
than
if
he
had
accepted
the
plea.
that's
the
only
reason.
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
well,
he
held
the
state
to
its
burden,
and
that
is
a
defense.
i
mean,
i--
ms.
valerie
r.
newman
--i'm
not
saying
literally
no
defense,
and
i
apologize
if
that's
the
what
he
it
came
across,
but
no
