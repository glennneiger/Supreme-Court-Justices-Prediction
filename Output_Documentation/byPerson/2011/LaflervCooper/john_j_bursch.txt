mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
press
this
morning
regarding
deficient
plea
advice.
first,
this
court
has
consistently
limited
the
effective
assistance
right
to
ensuring
the
reliability
of
the
proceedings
where
a
defendant
is
adjudicated
guilty
and
sentenced.
mere
outcome
is
not
the
strickland
prejudice
standard.
second,
when
asserting
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
the
defendant--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--justice
kagan,
even
in
kimmelman
the
court
remanded
back
to
the
lower
courts
to
determine
whether
there
was
prejudice,
and
the
obvious
implication
was
that
if
there
was
no
prejudice
on
the
fairness
of
the
adjudicatory
proceeding
itself,
there
would
be
no
sixth
amendment
violation.
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
press
this
morning
was
that
when
asserting
an
ineffective
assistance
claim,
a
defendant
must
show
deprivation
of
a
substantive
or
procedural
right,
and
this
court
has
already
held
that
a
defendant
has
no
right
to
a
plea
bargain.
third,
every
possible
remedy
for
deficient
plea
advice
creates
intractable
problems
demonstrating
the--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--justice
sotomayor,
the
--
the
not
guilty
plea
is
an
assertion
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
it's
invoking
the
right
to
trial
that
the
sixth
amendment
contemplates.
and
so
this
situation
is
really
more
like
fretwell.
it's
not
a
decision
that
you
have,
for
example,
whether
to
have
a
jury
or
not
to
have
a
jury,
or
whether
to
have
this
attorney
appointed
for
your
counsel
or
not,
because
in
each
of
those
cases
you
have
an
underlying
substantive
or
procedural
constitutional
right;
and
have
you
no
right
to
a
plea.
and
so
this
fork
in
the
road
is
really
an
illusory
one,
because
you
have
no
right
to
choose
the
other
side
of
the
fork.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i'm
saying--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes,
i'm
saying
that
there
is
no
violation,
because
in
order
to
prove
a
sixth
amendment
violation
you
have
to
demonstrate
unreliability
of
the
adjudicatory
process.
i
am
also
saying
that
there
is
no
reasonable
remedy,
and
i
will
talk
about
that
in
a
minute.
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty
in
particular,
i
would
refer
this
court
right
back
to
the
fretwell
decision,
because
there,
too,
defendant
and
his
counsel
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
a
collins
objection
that
would
have
changed
the
sentence
to
avoid
the
death
penalty
in
that
case.
collins
obviously
was
before
habeas
process,
and
this
court
held
that
the
defendant
could
not
use
the
vehicle
of
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
to
regain
that
lost
opportunity
because
he
had
no
constitutional
right
in
it.
and
so
really
the
remedy
--
i'm
sorry.
the
severity
of
the
sentence
doesn't
enter
the
analysis
once
you
have
established
that
there
has
been
no
violation.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
we
have
conceded
for
purposes
of
argument
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance.
but
strickland
is
a
two-part
test
and,
even
after
you
get
past
the
deficiency
prong,
there
is
still
the
question
of
whether
this
casts
some
doubt
on
the
reliability
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
that's
actually
the
best
argument
that
the
respondent
has
in
this
case.
and
the
reason--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
the
reason
why
it's
wrong
is
because
this
court
has
been
very
careful
to
define
what
that
harm
is.
specifically,
the
word
was
"outcome"
in
cronic
and
strickland.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes,
but
the
court
went
on
to
define
outcome
to
mean
reliability
of
the
adjudicatory
process.
specifically,
the
language
was
whether
absent
the
deficiency
the
defendant
--
i'm
sorry
--
absent
the
deficiency,
the
factfinder
would
have
had
a
reasonable
doubt
respecting
guilt.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
everyone
acknowledges--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
i
don't
believe
it's
quite
that
simple.
if
there
was
some
legal
error,
an
error
to
which
he
had
a
constitutional
right,
then
certainly
what
you
said
is
exactly
true.
but
if
you
are
talking
about
more
or
less
days
because
of,
for
example,
a
judge
thinking
that
the
difference
between
crack
and
cocaine
sentences
was
not
appropriate
or
other
things
that
are
really
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
judge,
strickland
says
absolutely
those
things
are
not
sixth
amendment
violations.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
let's
try
another
sentencing
hypothetical,
where
it's
clear
that
there
was
deficient
performance.
say
that
there
is
a
local
trial
court
judge
and
everyone
knows
that
he
has
a
certain
predilection
that
if
you
like
the
local
sports
team
he
is
going
to
give
you
a
break.
if
the
attorney
comes
in
and
he
does
not
press
the
argument
that
this
convicted
defendant
likes
the
local
sports
team,
he
gets
a
higher
sentence.
that's
still
not
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
really,
once
you
shift
sentencing,
the
question
is
were
you
legally
entitled
to
the
result.
and
simply
because
he
failed
to
appeal
to
the
right
discretionary
tendencies
of
the
trial
court
doesn't
really
make
a
difference.
here
we
are
talking,
obviously,
about
the
guilt
phase
and
it's
much
easier
here
because
it
says
clearly
in
strickland
and
cronic
and
kimmelman
and
many,
many
other
cases
that
that
outcome
difference,
the
harm
difference,
has
to
be
reliability
of
the
process
itself.
it's
a
process--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--under
the
court's
first
prong
of
strickland,
you
would
have
to
look
at
whatever
the
standards
of
professional
practice
were
and,
depending
how
lousy
the
bargainer
was,
it
could
or
could
not
be
deficient.
but
the
important
thing
is
if
it
didn't
have
any
effect
on
the
subsequent
trial
and
sentencing,
then
it
would
not
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
we
could
agree
with
that.
bargaining
is
not
what
this
is
about,
and
that's
why
this
court
has
held
in
weatherford
and
other
cases
that
there
is
no
right
to
the
plea
bargain
itself.
and
that's
really
the
second--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--because
in
the
95
percent
of
cases
that
are
disposed
of
that
way,
this
court
has
already
held
in
padilla
and
hill
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
have
effective
counsel
when
you
accepting
that
plea.
and
the
difference
is
when
you
are
accepting
a
plea
you're
being
convicted.
that
is
the
conviction.
and
this
court
frequently
establishes
different
tests
when
you
are
waiving
a
right,
for
example
the
right
to
go
to
trial,
versus
invoking
a
right,
going
to
trial.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because
there's
no
evidence
here,
not
even
a
contention,
that
his
belief
had
any
impact
whatsoever
on
the
fairness
of
the
trial
proceeding.
and
this
court
has
drawn
a
bright-line
rule
at
trial.
if
you
look
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
if
there
is
attorney
error
there,
deficiency--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right
again,
but
that
fork
in
the
road
is
not
one
to
which
he
has
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
i--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--correct,
we
are
assuming
that.
but
what
i
would
submit
respectfully
is
that
the
plea
stage
isn't
any
different
than
a
preliminary
hearing
or
a
line-up
or
a
suppression
hearing,
where
if
there
was
some
deficient
attorney
conduct
this
court
would
still
then
look
to
see
whether
it
had
an
adverse
impact
on
the
adjudication
of
guilt.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
absolutely.
under
hill
and
padilla,
this
court
has
said
when
you
give
up
your
right
to
trial
that's
a
very
different
situation
and
that
there
is
a
remedy
for
that.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it's
just--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--it's
just
like
the
difference
between
deciding
to
proceed
with
counsel,
in
which
case
there
is
no
barrier
to
entry,
or
deciding
to
proceed
without
counsel,
giving
up
the
constitutional--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--justice
scalia,
you
said
it
much
more
artfully,
but
that's
exactly
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
with
justice
ginsburg,
that
when
you
invoke
your
constitutional
rights,
your
right
to
have
an
attorney,
to
go
to
a
trial,
to
have
a
jury,
we
don't
set
up
barriers
to
entry.
it's
only
when
you
give
up
those
rights.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that
would
be
our
position,
because
that's
consistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
coleman
and
wade
and
kimmelman.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
under
fretwell
this
court
held
definitively
that
so
long
as
the
reliability
of
the
adjudicatory
process
and
sentence
were
intact,
that
the
deficient
advice
didn't
affect
it,
that
the
severity
of
the
punishment
was
not
legally
relevant.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
would
say
it
slightly
different--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--that
you
are
entitled
to
effective
counsel
at
every
critical
stage;
however,
it
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
violation
unless
it
casts
doubt
on
the
reliability
of
the
adjudication
of
guilt.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
because
under
the
strickland
and
cronic
cases
there
is
no
damage,
there's
no
sixth
amendment
violation,
unless
you
can
prove
the
prejudice.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
exactly
right.
and
let's
talk
about
the
two
remedies
that
are
most
frequently
bandied
about
in
the
circuit
courts.
first
is
to
order
a
new
trial.
and
to
us
it
makes
no
sense
to
order
a
second
trial
after
you
have
already
had
a
first
error-free
trial.
in
addition,
you
think
about
these
habeas
cases;
if
you
are
issuing
a
habeas
writ
and
vacating
a
sentence
8
or
9
years
after
the
fact,
like
you
are
here,
essentially
you
are
releasing
the,
defendant,
because
witnesses
will
die,
they
will
move
away,
memories
will
be
sparse,
and
so
that's
the
natural
effect
of
that.
and
in
cooper's
brief,
he
doesn't
even
advocate
for
a
second
trial;
he
asks
for
specific
performance.
the
problem
with
that
is
there
you
are
infringing
on
the
prosecutor's
discretion,
which
is
sacred,
to
say
what
his
plea
offer
is
going
to
be.
and
circumstances
have
changed
once
a
trial
has
taken
place.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
we
contend
it
violates
the
separation
of
powers.
but
you
bring
up
an
important
point
because
circumstances
have
changed
in
two
respects.
the
first
is
that
you
learn
more
information.
so
here,
for
example,
the
prosecutor
learned
that
not
only
did
mr.
cooper
shoot
kali
mundy,
but
he
did
it
while
she
was
screaming
and
running
away
from
him.
that's
a
changed
circumstance.
he
might
not
give
the
same
plea.
even
more
so
in
frye,
where
they
learned
that
he
was
picked
for
another
criminal
violation
after
the
plea
was
given,
and
the
prosecutor
testified
that
he
would
have
taken
the
plea
back
when
he
knew
that.
but
the
bigger
changed
circumstance
is
the
trial
itself,
because
the
prosecutor
has
now
gone
through
the
risk
of
having
an
acquittal.
he
has
also
put,
for
example,
the
8-year-old
sexual
abuse
defendant
on
the
stand,
something
he
tried
to
avoid
with
the
plea
offer.
and
it
truly
is
an
egg
that
cannot
be
unscrambled.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
of
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes,
that's
correct.
in
every
case--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--we
don't
--
we
don't
think
--
that's
not
part
of
our
argument
here.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
the
court
--
let
me
be
precise,
justice
kagan,
because
there
are
two
things
that
the
court
can
be
talking
about.
there's
the
--
there's
the
interaction
between
the
state
and
the
defendant,
and
that's
where
the
court
has
customarily
used
language
like
"critical
stage",
a
confrontation
between
the
defendant
and
the
prosecution.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
this
is
about
private
advice
between
the
lawyer
and
the
client,
and
we're
not
contesting--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
faced
up
--
faced
this
particular
situation,
justice
kagan.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
start
at
the
one
point
where
i
think
all
of
us,
including
counsel
on
both
sides
agree,
and
that's
that
a
second
trial
after
an
error-free
first
trial
doesn't
make
sense.
and
that
right
there
says
a
lot
about
mr.
cooper's
case,
because
a
strickland
remedy
is
typically
a
new
trial.
and
it's
exceedingly
strange
that
they
are
now
saying
that:
i
don't
want
a
new
trial.
that
demonstrates
that
what
they
are
claiming
is
not
a
strickland
violation.
i
would
like
to
address,
justice
breyer,
your
suggestion
that
maybe
you
could
have
specific
performance
of
the
plea;
and
if
it's
rejected,
then
the
trial
result
could
simply
be
re-imposed.
and
the
question
is:
well,
what's
the
problem
with
that?
and
i
can
tick
off
at
least
five.
first,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed,
out
it
takes
away
the
prosecutor's
ability
to
withdraw
the
plea
which
he
or
she
undeniably
would
have
had
the
right.
second,
as
justice
alito
said,
it
ignores
that
there
is
information
that
could
be
learned
in
the
interim.
mr.
cooper
could
have
shot
three
or
to
four
other
people.
third,
it
ignores
the
fact
that
an
error-free
trial
has
taken
place.
the
prosecutor
has
taken
the
risk
of
putting
that
the
8-year-old
sexual
abuse
victim
on
the
stand,
and
you
cannot
take
that
risk
away.
fourth,
as
i
already
mentioned,
we
have
the
separation
of
powers
issue
and
prosecutorial
discretion.
fifth,
we
are
going
to
have
intractable
problems.
say
the
offer
was
plead
to
a,
we
will
dismiss
b;
he
rejects
it
based
on
deficient
advice;
you
go
to
trial;
he
is
convicted
on
a
and
acquitted
on
b,
and
now
we
are
going
to
try
to
enforce
the
plea
on
a?
i
mean,
that's
almost
a
double
jeopardy
problem.
so
there
is
intractable
problems.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
about
the
death
situation.
and
that's
one
we
take
very
seriously.
and,
justice
alito,
it
may
be
that
in
a
death
penalty
situation
there
could
be
a
due
process
right
or
some
other
constitutional
right
that
may
mitigate
in
favor
of
requiring
something
be
put
on
the
record.
but
what
is
clear
is
that
under
this
court's
existing
precedent,
that
is
not
a
strickland
violation
because
the
amount
of
the
sentence,
whether
it's
death
or
50
years,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
reliability
of
the
adjudicatory
proceeding
and
the
sentence.
finally,
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
something
else
on
which
we
can
all
agree.
mr.
cooper
is
guilty
of
shooting
kali
mundy.
he
also
got
exactly
the
sentence
that
the
people
prescribed
for
the
crime
that
committed.
there
is
very
little
unfair
about
holding
him
to
that
sentence.
as
justice
kennedy
said,
"it's
the
position
of
mr.
cooper
that
it
is
unfair
to
have
a
fair
trial.
"
and
from
our
perspective,
that
is
really
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
this
inquiry.
and
unless
you
have
any
further
questions--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--it
could
be
good
practice,
but
it
wouldn't
have
solved
the
problem
here,
because
even
if
they
had
put
the
fact
of
the
plea
on
the
record,
the
problem
was
the
alleged
deficient
advice
that
the
lawyer
gave
to
the
client
in
private.
and
so
that
doesn't
solve
the
core
problem.
the
core
problem
is
that
they
are
trying
to
claim
that
it
was
unfair
to
have
a
fair
trial.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
you
know,
the
judge
under
your
theory
then
would
have
had
to
inquire:
well,
what
advice
did
your
attorney
give
you
with
respect
to
that?
and
then
evaluate
whether
that
advice
was
good
advice
or
bad
advice.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
would
not
be
a
good
policy
to
adopt
by
rule.
