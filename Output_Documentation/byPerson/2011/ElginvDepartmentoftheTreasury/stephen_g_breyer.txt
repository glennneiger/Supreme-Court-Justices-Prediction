justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
problem?
he
says
--
the
employee
says:
i
was
dismissed.
mspb
says:
that's
right,
you
were
and
it's
lawful.
the
employee
says:
you
didn't
consider
my
argument
that
the
relevant
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mspb
says:
no,
we
can't.
the
federal
circuit
says:
but
we
can,
so
make
your
argument.
what's
the
problem?
and
then
i'll
decide
it.
and
if
they
decide
it's
unconstitutional,
then
the
action
of
the
mspb
is
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
i'm
just
saying
is
there
any
practical
problem
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
fine.
what
they
say
is:
you
have
one
argument
here,
that
the
statute
that
led
to
your
dismissal
is
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
that,
therefore
we
say
you
were
rightly
dismissed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
they
appeal
that,
and
they
say:
they
are
right
that
they
didn't,
but
you
do,
so
will
you
please
decide
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional?
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
may
be
unusual.
i
just
want
to
know
what's
the
problem.
i'm
not
saying
there
isn't
one.
i
want
to
know
what's
the
problem
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't
affirm
the
dismissal.
it
says
the
dismissal
was
unconstitutional;
go
reinstate
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
every
day
of
the
week
we
get
constitutional
claims
and
people
submit
all
their
arguments
in
the
briefs.
now,
occasionally
there
is
one
you
have
to
have
factual
development
and
i
grant
you
on
that
one
maybe
they
could
appoint
a
special
master
or,
if
not,
send
it
back.
but
they
have
plenty
of
authority
to
get
them
to
argue
the
facts.
but
i
doubt
--
i
don't
know
if
there
are
such
claims.
but
i
don't
see
why
that
would
be
a
problem.
now,
i'm
not
--
again
i'm
not
giving
you
an
answer,
i'm
giving
you
a
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
conclusion
and
i
want
to
know
what
--
what
is
the
practical
reason
that
that
wouldn't
work
or
why
is
that
such
a
big
problem
to
have
it
work
that
way?
i'm
asking
for
your
answer
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
one
where
it
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
one
where
it
wouldn't.
but
i
don't
want
to
cut
into
your
time.
your
time
is
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
have
to
be
thinking
about
it
and
if
you
want
to
respond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
delay
the
--
don't
pause
too
long,
but
i'm
curious.
where
did
this
rule
--
is
there
a
statute
or
something
that
says
an
agency
can't
say
this
action
would
be
unconstitutional?
where
does
that
idea
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
it
sounds
--
really
what
the
argument
boils
down
to
is,
is
if
we
accept
your
position,
there's
a
kind
of
procedural
complexity
and
anomaly.
and
your
argument
is
that
his
position's
worse.
yours
is
also
fairly
bad.
[laughter]
so,
that's
his
point.
so
i
mean
--
but
that's
why
i
wondered.
i
mean,
u.s.
magistrates
all,
tax
courts,
all
kinds
of
people
as
a
preliminary
matter
have
jobs
where
they
say
we
think
a
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
suppose
millions
--
i
don't
know
how
many.
so
--
so
is
this
coming
that
they
can't
do
it
from
some
kind
of
lore
from
kenneth
davis
or
something?
what's
--
what's
the
basis
of
this?
and
wouldn't
it
be
simpler
if
you
just
said
it
says
they
can
take
appropriate
relief;
they
can
take
appropriate
relief,
period.
end
of
the
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
somebody
quoted
kenneth
davis
in
1958,
and
wrote
it
into
an
opinion
in
a
holding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
kenneth
davis
said
this
in
1958.
