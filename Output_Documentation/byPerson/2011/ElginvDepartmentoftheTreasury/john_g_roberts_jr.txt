chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-45,
elgin
v.
department
of
the
treasury.
mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
just
to
clarify:
no,
they
wouldn't
say
that?
or
--
i
lost
this,
which
way
your
"no"
was
going.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
--
i
please
verify
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
before
you
move
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
the
rule
--
that's
the
rule
that
you
would
apply
across
the
board,
so
only
in
the
case
of
a
facial
challenge
do
you
get
to
go
to
the
district
court?
if
it's
an
as-applied;
this
law
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
me,
that's
still
before
the
mspb?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
your
position,
as
i
understood
it,
in
your
response
to
my
earlier
question.
you
said
that
the
--
it
is
all
right
to
have
as-applied
constitutional
challenges
presented
to
the
mspb
or
not
presented
but
then
reviewed
in
the
federal
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
but
--
but
within
the
statutory
scheme,
are
you
saying
that
a
claim
that
this
statute
is,
while
not
facially
unconstitutional,
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
me?
where
does
that
go?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
probably
mine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
does
--
where
does
that
claim
go?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
type,
summer
interns
and
fbi
employees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
assume
that's
for
very
different
reasons,
one
because
they
are
summer
interns
and
you
know,
if
they
are
impermissibly
treated
it's
kind
of,
they
are
summer
interns.
there
is
no
reason
to
get--
[laughter]
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
that
facetiously.
i
mean
what
they're
saying
is
that
there
is
some
level
of
de
minimis
personnel
actions
when
you're
talking
about
the
vast
federal
bureaucracy
that
we
don't
have
to
really
give
the
whole
panoply
of
rights.
and
fbi
agents,
i
assume
it's
because
of
the
sensitive
nature
of
what
they
deal
with.
so
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
do
you
want
us
to
focus
on
the
millions
of
employees
who
would
now
be
going
to
district
court
or
do
you
want
us
to
focus
on
the
small
number
that
have
facial
constitutional
challenges?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
really
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
mspb?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"jurisdiction"
is
a
word
with
many
meanings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
feigin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
can
ask
you
to
pause
briefly
on
that
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
government
--
if
mr.
schwartz
comes
in
before
the
mspb
and
says,
we
have
three
witnesses
who
are
only
going
to
testify
on
the
constitutional
issue;
i
have
this
volume
of
evidence
about
what's
happening
in
the
military;
it's
only
relevant
in
the
constitutional
issue;
and,
you
know,
it's
going
to
take
us
two
days
to
present
this.
the
government
is
going
to
say
it's
okay
with
us,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
are
not
going
to
object
that
that's
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
to
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
could
just
focus
there.
in
your
brief,
you're
quite
careful,
and
you
have
been
today,
to
talk
to
even
if
the
mspb
lacked
this
authority.
it's
--
it's
your
position
that
the
mspb
does
lack
this
authority
in
fact;
right?
it's
not
just
the
mspb's
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
like
that.
[laughter]
i
mean,
the
idea
of
--
the
special
masters
floating
around
freely
every
time
you
get
one
of
these
cases?
i
mean,
what
--
inevitably
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
you're
going
to
have
a
more
or
less
permanent
special
master
who
gets
all
these
things.
you're
not
going
to
appoint
85
special
masters
if
there
are
85
of
these
sorts
of
claims.
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
an
agency
there
that's
expert
in
the
interrelation
between
the
different
provisions
in
the
statute.
and
why
don't
--
you
know,
why
don't
--
they
make
fact-findings
all
the
time
in
--
in
areas
within
their
authority
to
decide.
it
seems
to
me
it's
ready-made
for
sending
these
things
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
i
guess
the
party
doesn't
--
doesn't
even
have
to
raise
its
constitutional
claim
before
the
mspb,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
pretty
odd
to
say
that
you've
somehow
waived
a
claim
you
couldn't
pursue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,--
mr.
feigin.
mr.
schwartz,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-45,
elgin
versus
department
of
the
treasury.
