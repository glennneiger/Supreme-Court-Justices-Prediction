justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--are
you
talking
about
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute?
as
a
--
am
i
understanding
you
right?
a
facial
challenge
goes
to
the
district
court
and
a
constitutional
as-applied
challenge
goes
to
the
commission?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
how
--
how
--
how
this
is
any
different
than
the
administrative
system
and
review
system
that
was
reviewed
in
thunder
basin
and
illinois
long-term
care?
in
both
those
statutes,
the
agencies
weren't
permitted
to
consider
facial
challenges,
constitutional
challenges;
and
we
said
that's
okay,
they
can't,
but
the
reviewing
court
can.
so
how's
that
any
different
from
the
situation
you're
proposing
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
please
deal
with
the
language
of
both
cases.
both
cases
said
even
if
the
agency
can't
review
a
constitutional
challenge,
there
is
still
review
within
the
federal
circuit,
within
the
court
--
within
the
circuit
courts
and
that's
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
that
okay
here?
i
think
that
was
justice
scalia's
question
to
you.
i
know
that
you
say
well,
the
federal
circuit
won't
have
a
record.
but
the
government
says
if
it
wants
a
record,
it
can
remand
and
ask
the
agency
to
develop
it.
so
what's
wrong
with
that
procedure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
one
of
the
challenges
here
by
one
of
the
petitioners
that
he
was
constructively
discharged?
isn't
that
an
issue
that
the
board
is
better
suited
to
determine
in
the
first
instance,
whether
there
was
at
all
a
constructive
discharge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
your
--
is
that
your
answer
for
that's
why
it's
an
out
for
their
failure
to
have
gone
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
will
they
be
able
--
if
the
commission
says,
no,
we
won't
reopen,
do
they
have
any
avenue
now
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
please
finish
with
your
answer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
go
back
to
your
interesting
suggestion
that
the
board
should
decide
the
constitutional
issue,
i've
just
been
spending
a
little
bit
of
time
going
through
the
act,
and
you're
certainly
--
it
doesn't
appear
that
there's
anything
in
the
act
that
precludes
them
from
granting
any
appropriate
relief
with
respect
to
an
unlawful
discharge.
am
i
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
rule
of
the
board
that
stops
a
litigant
from
making
a
proffer
--
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wouldn't
that
be
the
proper
way
of
doing
it,
if
you're
going
to
go
up
on
a
constitutional
claim?
make
your
offer
of
proof
and
then
the
federal
circuit
can
decide
if
it
needs
more
evidence
or
not.
