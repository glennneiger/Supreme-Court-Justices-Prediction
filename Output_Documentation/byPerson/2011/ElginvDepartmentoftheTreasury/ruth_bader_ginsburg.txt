mr.
schwartz--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
schwartz,
i
thought
you're
talking
about
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
any
constitutional
claim
that
there
has
been
unconstitutional
action
by
an
official.
i
thought
that
your
point
was
when
you're
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
then
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
--
your
position
was
that
the
merit
systems
protection
board
has
said
we
have
no
authority
to
adjudicate
constitutional
questions,
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
thought
the
court
was
saying
that
this
claim
is
dismissed
because
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
question.
and
then
your
next
--
the
federal
circuit,
well,
how
can
the
federal
circuit
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
when
the
first-instance
decisionmaker
said
it
didn't
have
authority
to
render
the
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
that's
what
your
position
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
position
was
that
whatever
the
mspb
cannot
hear,
then
you
go
to
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
take
the
position
that,
the
mspb
having
no
jurisdiction
and
saying
it
has
no
jurisdiction
it,
can
adjudicate
this
matter,
well
then,
a
reviewing
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to,
to
--
to
review?
there
is
nothing
to
review
because
the
mspb
said,
we
have
no
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
point
was
and
hasn't
the
federal
circuit
said
that
the
mspb
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
an
appellate
court
is
reviewing
a
court
of
first
instance.
the
scheme
that
has
been
proposed
would
turn
the
federal
circuit
into
a
court
of
first
instance,
rather
than
an
appellate
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
said
this
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
one,
because
you
want
to
make
a
record
of
all
the
changes
that
have
occurred
in
the
service
and
you
need
much
more
than
briefs.
you
need
to
have
maybe
testimony
from
people
who
have
--
who
have
been
working
with
the
changes
and
the
opportunities
of
limiting
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
statutes
to
which
you
refer
said
that
no
action
on
the
claim
for
social
security
benefits,
no
action
shall
be
brought
under
1331.
there
is
no
such
provision
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
go
back
and
tell
me
when
the
government
changed
its
position.
it
was
my
understanding
that
up
until,
well
certainly
this
case
was
litigated,
the
government
was
taking
the
position
mspb
has
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
when
did
government
back
away
from
that
position?
when
did
it
say
no,
we
were
wrong;
they
do
have
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
such
possibility
in
this
case?
i
mean,
the
statute
says:
men
must
register
for
the
draft.
there
is
no
way
to
avoid,
to
reread
that
statute,
to
say
anything
other
than
that.
so
i
don't,
i
don't
see
any
constitutional
avoidance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
johnson
v.
robison
is
one
such
case.
i
don't
recall
in
that
case
anybody
referring
to
an
--
any
administrative
law
treatise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
of
any
other
--
any
other
case
where
an
appellant
court
has
authority
to
decide
a
question
that
the
court
of
first
instance
lacked
authority
to
decide?
you
say
mspb
says
it
has
no
authority,
and
you
agree
with
that.
i
couldn't
think
of
another
case
where
a
court
of
appeals,
which
is
a
court
of
review,
not
first
view,
substitutes
itself
for
an
incompetent
court
of
first
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
--
where
did
salfi
go?
the
agency
couldn't
decide
the
constitutional
question,
so
what's
the
next
stop?
was
it
a
court
of
appeals
or
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
um-hum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
on
the
constitutional
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
the
district
court
is
--
that's
what
it's
equipped
to
do.
that's
what
it
does
all
the
time.
and--
