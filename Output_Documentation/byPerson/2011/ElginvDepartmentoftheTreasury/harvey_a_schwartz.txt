mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
it
is
fairly
discernible
from
the
civil
service
reform
act
that
congress
revoked
the
district
court
jurisdiction
to
declare
acts
of
congress
unconstitutional
in
actions
brought
by
federal
employees.
the
answer
is
no,
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
civil
service
reform
act
doesn't
say
that
it
precludes
section
1331
jurisdiction.
congress
could
have
said
so.
congress
didn't
say
so.
and
there's
no
inference
of
preclusion
of
the
petitioners'
claims
that's
fairly
discernible
from
the
scheme
itself.
and
that's
because
challenges
to
constitutionality
of
statutes
are
just
not
the
type
of
claims
that
are
reviewed
through
the
csra
scheme.
because
of
this,
the
merit
systems
protection
board
dismisses
challenge
--
challenges
to
constitutionality
of
a
statute
routinely
as
outside
of
its
authority.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes?
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that,
because
of
normal
rules
against
splitting
of
claims,
the
employee
would
have
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
because
of
the
importance
of
making
the
constitutional
claims
available
in
--
in
a
--
for
judicial
review.
that
is
--
that's
just
one
--
one
of
the
options
that
the
employee
would
have
to
weigh.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that
--
that
certainly
is
a
possibility,
your
honor.
and
--
and
it
is
a
possibility
that
the
employee
could
bring
his
constitutional
claim
in
the
district
court
and
still
pursue
his
statutory
claim
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
however,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that,
while
this
is
an
interesting
hypothetical,
we
don't
have
to
look
at
hypotheticals
in
this
situation
because
we
have
in
the
third
circuit
since
1986
and
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
since
1995,
those
two
circuits
permit
federal
employees
to
bring
their
constitutional
claims
in
the
circuit
court.
we
are
unable
to
find
a
single
instance
in
which
there
has
been
one
of
these
mixed
claims
of
a
--
a
constitutional
claim
and
a
statutory
claim
brought
in
those
circuits.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
we
--
we
were
unable
to
--
to
find
any
example
of
--
of
that
happening.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
i
--
and
i
--
i
agree
that
that
is
a
more
difficult
situation.
but
it's
not
the
situation
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case
at
least.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
i
don't
know
why
it
doesn't
often
arise.
it
--
it
might
be
that
--
that
people
prefer
to
leave
their
claims
in
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
your
honor,
if
--
if
an
employee
is
--
is
fired
because
of
his
religion,
there's
--
there
is
a
--
a
separate
procedure
for
discrimination
claims
such
as
could
be
brought
under
title
vii;
and
in
fact,
in
--
those
claims
do
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
that
claim
now
could
be
brought
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
and
i
agree
that
--
that
it
can
be
brought
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
and
i'm
not
urging
this
court
to
say
that
that--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--no.
no.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
okay.
i'll
retract
my
"no"
then.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that's
it
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that
is
my
point
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
i
am
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
as
the
petitioners
are
doing
here,
and
that
is
beyond
the
--
the
authority
of
the
merit
systems--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
and
--
and
that
--
that's
the
procedure.
the
as-applied
challenge,
those
cases
are
bread
and
butter
cases
at
the
merit
systems
protection
board
now.
if
somebody
says,
i
was
fired
because
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
editor
that
my
boss
didn't
like,
he
is
not
challenging
the
constitutional--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
i
would
--
with
due
respect,
i
--
i
--
i
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
the
expertise
required
to
decide
the
present
petitioners'
claim
and
the
letter
to
the
editor
claim
is
totally
different.
in
the
letter
to
the
editor
claim,
the
facts
concern
the
facts
of
the
workplace,
what
was
my
boss's
motivation,
what
were
his
actual
reasons
for
firing
me.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
justice
scalia,
i
--
i
agree
that
in
the
as-applied
challenge,
where
somebody
says
my
rights
were
violated,
that
case
now
goes
and
should
go
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
in
the
present
case,
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
application
of
a
statute.
there
is
no
challenge
to
any
decision
that
was
made
by
--
by
managers.
the
challenge
is
to
the
decision
made
by
congress
in
enacting--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
and
--
and--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
there
are
several
significant
differences.
i'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
go
through
them.
first
of
all,
in
the
thunder
basin
case
the
--
the
constitutional
challenge
was
--
was
to
the
procedures
that
--
that
were
being
applied.
the
--
the
agency,
the
mine
safety
commission,
was
--
was
an
expert
in
those
procedures.
the
facts
that
were
involved
in
making
that
determination
were
the
very
facts
that
this
mine
safety
commission
had
expertise
in.
in
the
present
case,
the
challenge
is
to
the
selective
service
laws.
the
merit
systems
protection
board--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
the
first
thing
that's
wrong
--
that's
wrong
with
that
procedure
as
it
would
be
applied
to
this
case
is
that
it's
--
it's
a
vast
departure
from
the
civil
service
reform
act
scheme
as
it
was
created
by
congress;
and
--
and
because
that
scheme
involves
the
merit
systems
protection
board
acting
as
a
trial
court;
and
--
and
given
the
first
level
of
review
and
in
effect
substituting
for
the
--
for
a
district
court.
and
then--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
in
fact,
it's
--
it's
just
the
reverse
of
that,
where
that
one
petitioner
would
be
taking
the
position
that
he
was
not
constructively
discharged.
if
he
was
constructively
discharged,
the
merit
systems
protection
board
arguably
would
have
jurisdiction.
if
he
voluntarily
resigned
under
the
government's
theory,
he
would
be
among
the
class
of
federal
employees
--
it
constitutes
about
a
third
of
federal
employees
--
who
have
no
appellate
rights
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that
is
what
our
position
is,
and,
and
it
leaves
open
the
question
of
just
what
the
federal
circuit
is
going
to
do
after
the
merit
systems
protection
board
has
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
my
position
is
that
if
the
mspb
has
jurisdiction
to
find
a
statute
--
that
since
the
mspb
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
find
a
statute
unconstitutional,
any
claim
in
which
the
employee
is
asking
for
them
to
find
a
statute
unconstitutional
is
one
that
is
outside
of
the
csra
scheme.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
i
apologize
for
my
confusion
about--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--i
would
defer
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
my
confusion
is
about
the
use
of
the
term
"as-applied".
and
i
rather
than
using
terms
such
as
"facial"
or
"as-applied"
where
the
dividing
line
can
be
somewhat
blurry,
i
propose
drawing
the
dividing
line
between
a
case
where
the
employee
is
saying,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
i'm
saying
congress
made
a
mistake.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes,
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
the
cases
that
would
not
be
within
the
mspb's
authority
would
include
cases
where
the
employee
says
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
would
also
include
the
million
or
so
federal
employees
who,
as
the
government
says,
have
no
appellate
rights
to
the
mspb,
all
--
all
of
those
persons,
career;
those
persons,
summer
interns,
fbi
employees.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
actually,
your
honor,
it's
the
government
that
is
taking
the
position
that
the
summer
interns,
the
fbi
agents,
all
the
government
attorneys,
federal
government
chaplains,
who
have
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
mspb,
all
of
those
persons
the
government
says
can
bring
their
constitutional
claims
to
the
district
court.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
because
the
summer
intern,
the
fbi
agent,
the
nonpreference
employee,
the
accepted
service
employees,
unless
they
have
a
claim
that
they
can
take
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
they
are
precluded
from
going
to
any
other
court.
they're
precluded
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
that's
this
court's
fausto
decision,
and
in
this
court's
fausto
decision
a
federal
employee
who
could
not
bring
a
case,
his
appeal
from
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
tried
to
bring
a
back
pay
act
claim
in
the
court
of
claims
and
this
court
said,
no,
that
is
precluded.
and
what
the
government
is
doing
is
saying,
you
got
a
right
in
fausto,
but
for
constitutional
claims
mr.
fausto
had
it
right.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well
i
--
i
agree
with
you
completely
that,
that
constitutional
claims
are
different
from
statutory
claims.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
or
damages
case.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
and
that's,
that's
the
position
i'm
taking.
i'm
taking
it
a
step
beyond
the
government,
however.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
but
i
--
i'm
limiting
that
to
those
people
who
can
appeal
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
but
the
merit
systems
protection
board
has
no
authority
to
grant
them
relief.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
just
the
first
category.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
no,
no,
no.
and
that's,
that's
--
that's
why
--
that's
why
i'm
specifically
not
trying
to
say
where
the
line
is
between
asapplied
and
facial.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
i
agree
that
a
system
can
be
proposed
to
get
these
claims
to
the
federal
circuit.
however,
it's
not
the
system
of
the
--
that
congress
created
in
the
civil
service
reform
act.
and
the
significance
of
the
contortions
that
have
to
be
gone
through
to
get
these
claims
to
the
federal
circuit
demonstrates
that
it's
not
fairly
discernible
from
the
civil
service
reform
act
as
written
by
congress
that--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--that's
how
it
would
work
in
the
real
world.
i
mean,
what
is
--
what
is
the
federal
circuit
supposed
to
do?
it
has
an
order
from
the
mspb
that
says,
we
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
federal
circuit
--
and
the
government
doesn't
say
that
that
is
wrong.
the
federal
circuit
says:
we
affirm
your
dismissal
and
now
we'll
move
on
to
the
merits.
that
--
it's
possible
we
could
have
a
system
like
that,
but
that
isn't
the
system
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
and
that's
not
the
way
that
appellate
courts
normally
function.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
and
--
and
--
and
there
is
a
general
rule
with
that
--
there
have
been
exceptions
to
--
that
administrative
agencies
do
not
have
authority
to
rule
on
constitutionality
of
statutes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that's
a
system
that,
that
could
come
up.
it's
not
the
system
of
the
civil
service
reform
act.
because--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--oh,
it
presents
immense
practical
problem.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
which
is
that
the
merit
systems
protection
board
is
not
going
to
say
we
affirm
your
dismissal
or
that
--
it's
not
going
to
reach
the
merits.
it's
going
to,
it's
going
to
get
the
paperwork,--
the
government
is
going
to--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
that's
--
that's
an
unusual
form
of--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--okay,
the
problem,
if
that
is
the
system
that's
going
to
be
in
place,
is
that
it's
not
quite
that
straightforward.
it's
--
at
first
the
employee
has
to
file
his
claim
in
the
mspb
with
everybody
knowing
it's
going
to
be
dismissed.
he
then
appeals
that
dismissal
to
the
federal
circuit,
which
affirms
the
dismissal,
says
yes,
mspb
has
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
and
then
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
where
--
the
reason
that
this
challenge
to
rostker
is
that
the
facts
have
changed.
there
was
extensive
factual
discovery
in
rostker.
so--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--that's
what
the
federal
circuit
had
said.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
and
that
is
why
what's
proposed
by
the
government
is
such
a
departure
from
the
csra
scheme
as
written
by
congress,
in
which
mspb
has
first
instance
jurisdiction,
the
federal
circuit
has
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
the
problem
is
that
that's
not
the
scheme
written
by
congress--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--okay.
i
mean,
that's
--
that
system
could
work
in
some
cases.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
excuse
me?
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
okay.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
that's
correct.
this
--
this
case
would
be
the
example.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
thank
you.
we
are
not
here
for
an
exercise
in
which
side
can
best
rewrite
the
civil
service
reform
act
so
that
the
petitioners'
claims
can
fit
in
it.
what
we
are
here
for
is
to
determine
whether
the
background
rule
that
federal
courts
have
federal
question
jurisdiction,
under
the
common
law
and
under
section
1331,
to
rule
on
claims
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
now,
the
fall-back
position
is
that
that
jurisdiction
remains.
what
this
court
is
--
is
tasked
to
do
is
to
see
whether
it's
fairly
discernible
from
the
civil
service
reform
act
as
it
was
written
by
congress,
not
has
it's
twisted
or
amended
or
bent
to
fit
these
claims
in
it.
whether
the
civil
service
reform
act
as
written
by
congress
revokes
that
background
federal
court
jurisdiction.
and
i
suggest
that
the
gyrations
that
have
been
discussed
about
well,
we
could
do
this,
we
could
go
up,
we
could
go
down,
we
could
do
these
odd
procedures,
show
that
it
is
not
fairly
discernible
that
congress
intended
to
somehow
try
to
shoehorn
these
claims
within
the
csra
framework.
and
for
that
reason,
not
because
the
government
system
is
better,
not
because
the
system
that
i'm
proposing
works
better
or
is
faster,
but
because
there
is
no
fairly
discernible
evidence
from
the
civil
service
reform
act
as
written
by
congress,
that
congress
intended
to
revoke
this
very
fundamental
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts.
this
is
a
marbury
case,
not
a
bivens
case.
this
is
fundamental
jurisdiction,
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
say
that
congress,
not
some
federal
agency,
but
that
congress
acted
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
i
suggest
that
it
--
the
court
should
act
carefully
before
deciding
that
congress
took
that
fundamental
jurisdiction
away
from
the
district
courts,
and
that
is
not
fairly
discernible
that
congress
did
that
through
awarding
of
the
civil
service
reform
act.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
thank
you.
