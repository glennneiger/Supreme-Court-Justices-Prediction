justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
you
make
that
concession?
why
wouldn't
it
be
possible
in
that,
for
an
employee
to
choose?
if
the
employee
had
both
constitutional
and
nonconstitutional
claims,
perhaps
that
employee
could
take
advantage
of
the
review
scheme
that's
outlined
by
the
government.
but
in
the
situation
where
there's
purely
a
challenge
to
a
statute,
the
employee
would
have
the
option
of
bringing
the
claim
in
one
of
the
district
courts.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
at
least
--
at
least
three
different
kind
of
constitutional
claims
and
i'm
not
sure
where
you're
drawing
the
line
with
respect
to
your
argument.
there
is
a
claim
that
--
that
the
agency
acted
in
an
unconstitutional
manner,
not
that
any
statute
is
unconstitutional--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
there
is
unconstitutional
executive
action.
there
is
an
as
applied
claim.
let's
say
that
the
plaintiff
says
that
the
registration
requirement
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
me,
not
to
other
people,
but
to
me
because
i'm
a
conscientious
objector
or
i
have
religious
objections
to
military
action
that
the
united
states
is
taking
at
this
particular
time
and
then
there
is
--
there
is
a
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
space.
where
do
you
--
which
of
those
can
the
merit
systems
protection
review
board
decide,
just
the
first
category?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it's
not
a
distinction
between
as-applied
and
facial.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
it
--
how
can
it
deal
with
discovery
without
knowing
--
without
going
into
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim?
in
other
words,
the
parties
can
just
put
in
any
evidence
they
any
evidence
they
want?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
any
evidence
they
think
might
be
possibly
be
relevant
to
the
case,
they
can
put
that
in.
it
can
be
discovery
of
anything.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
are
not
the
same
claim.
they
are
related,
but
one
says
the
statute
means
something;
and
insofar
as
it's
applied
to
a
particular
situation,
it's
unconstitutional.
the
other
one
says
it
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
we
just
wanted
to
rephrase
that
--
if
this
court
adopts
a
certain
interpretation
based
on
principle
of
constitutional
avoidance,
do
you
think
the
court
is
rewriting
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
congress
--
congress
is
unhappy
when
this
court
holds
a
statute
unconstitutional.
[laughter]
do
you
think
it's
really
likely
that
they
intended
for
the
ms
--
the
mspb
to
have
the
authority
to
declare
its
acts
unconstitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
somebody
who
drafted
or
voted
for
the
civil
service
reform
act
had
thought
about
a
case
like
this,
where
it's
a
pure
question
of
law,
a
facial
challenge
to
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
do
you
think
they
would
have
said
well,
the
way
we
think
that
this
should
be
handled
is
this
scheme
that
you
have
proposed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
suspect
that
if
this
were
litigated
in
district
court,
the
government
would
move
to
dismiss
and
would
take
the
position
that
it
doesn't
matter;
even
if
women
can
now
do
99
percent
of
the
--
the
things
that
are
done
in
the
military,
the
--
the
registration
act
is
still
constitutional.
wouldn't
you
take
that
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
say
that
if
--
if
it
can
be
proven
that
they
have
--
that
women
are
now,
that
the
percentage
is
now
high
enough,
the
statute
may
be
unconstitutional?
anyway,
assuming
that
you
might
take
that
position,
then
--
and
you
might
win
on
that
--
then
what
would
be
the
point
of
having
all
of
this
discovery
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
of
this
--
all
of
this
development
of
the
factual
record?
what
--
what
sense
does
it
make
to
develop
a
big
factual
record
before
you
know
whether
it's
even
--
whether
it
even
makes
any
difference?
