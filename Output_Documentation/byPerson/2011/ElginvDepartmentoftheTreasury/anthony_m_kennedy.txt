what
--
what
would
happen
if
--
if
the
employee
is
fired
because
of
his
or
her
religion
and
he
goes
to
mspb.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
is
a
first
amendment
claim.
mspb
has
to
say,
well,
this
is
not
adequate
cause
and
find
something
else
in
the
statute?
it
can't
look
at
the
constitutional
aspect
of
the
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
because
--
well,
let's
--
then
i
have
to
do
a
new
hypothetical.
because
he
gave
a
--
a
speech--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--saying
there
is
no
global
warming
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
mspb
--
we
can't
look
at
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
i
was
leading
up
to
say,
why
should
there
be
a
difference?
if
the
mspb
has
this
expertise
in
as-applied,
why
doesn't
it
have
it
for
facial?
i
mean,
the
expertise
question,
it
can't
be
a
matter
of
expertise;
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
