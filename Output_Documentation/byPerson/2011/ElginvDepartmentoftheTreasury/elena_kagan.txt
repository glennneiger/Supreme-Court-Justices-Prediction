mr.
schwartz--
justice
elena
kagan
--suppose
an
employee
is
fired
and
he
has
a
variety
of
different
kinds
of
claims,
constitutional
and
statutory.
what
would
you
think
happens
then?
does
he
bring
the
constitutional
claims
in
one
court
but
the
statutory
claims
in
another
court
--
excuse
me
--
in
the
--
in
the
commission?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
seems
just
as
bad.
in
other
words,
that
then,
you
--
it's
not
inefficient
necessarily,
but
your
scheme
would
force
the
employee
to
choose
between
her
constitutional
claims
and
her
statutory
claims.
justice
elena
kagan
why
--
why
would
we
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
you
suggested
that
it's
a
situation
that
doesn't
often
arise
and
i
guess
that
puzzles
me.
why
wouldn't
it
often
arise?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
wouldn't
the
dividing
line
be
--
and
i
think
that
this
is
consistent
with
your
argument
--
the
dividing
line
should
be
where
the
mspb
itself
could
decide
the
claim.
justice
elena
kagan
if
the
mspb
can
decide
the
claim,
then
it
goes
to
the
mspb.
if
the
mspb
can't
decide
the
claim,
i
think
is
what
you
are
saying,
saying
then
this
has
to
go
to
the
district
court.
justice
elena
kagan
and
you're
saying
that
the
mspb
has
said
that,
although
it
can
decide,
can
decide,
cases
where
he
says,
you
know,
my
supervisor
fired
me
for
a
discriminatory
reason,
that
that's
within
the
scope
of
the
mspb's
authority,
a
claim
like
this,
which
is
that
the
selective
service
act
is
unconstitutional
full
stop,
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
mspb's
authority.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
and
in
your
original
briefs,
mr.
schwartz,
you
suggested
that
if
the
mspb
can't
hear
a
claim,
neither
can
the
federal
circuit.
and
as
i
understood
the
government's
brief,
the
government
comes
back
and
said
that's
not
the
case.
even
when
the
mspb
can't
hear
a
claim,
the
federal
circuit
could
hear
it.
now,
then
there
is
a
question
of
if
there
is
a
necessity
for
a
record
how
does
the
record
get
developed.
but
do
you
now
concede
that
the
federal
circuit
could
hear
the
claim
as
a
matter,
you
know,
at
the
first
level?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
isn't
your
basic
answer
to
justice
breyer,
i
mean
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
you
think
that
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
record
that
the
federal
circuit
can
use
to
evaluate
this
constitutional
claim.
justice
elena
kagan
you
could
just
ask
the
mspb,
mr.
feigin.
if
you
bring
the
claim
to
the
mspb
and
then
the
mspb
says,
no,
we
have
no
authority
to
adjudicate
this
claim,
then
you
know
that
you're
in
a
world
in
which
the
mspb
doesn't
have
authority,
so
that
you
can
go
to
the
district
court.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
the
csra
is
presuming
that
the
mspb
actually
can
decide
something.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
could
you
help
me
with
something,
because
i
agree
with
you,
thunder
basin
is
a
very
strong
case
for
you,
but
mcnary
is
a
very
strong
case
for
mr.
schwartz.
and
i
read
those
two
opinions
and
frankly
i
have
a
tough
time
reconciling
them.
so
could
you
tell
me
how
you
do?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
i
imagine.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
its
very
different
because
the
magistrate
can
come
back
to
the
district
court
judge
and
say,
we
have
a
tough
one,
your
honor,
why
don't
you
decide
it?
i
mean,
here
you're
stipulating
that
the
board
has
no
power
to
decide
this
question.
call
it
jurisdiction;
call
it
something
else.
the
board
cannot
decide
the
question,
but
the
board
is
going
to
now
become
the
arbiter
of
discovery
disputes?
the
fact
finder?
i
mean,
weird
is
a
good
word
for
it.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
the
mspb
should
find
facts
with
regard
to
this
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
i
would
think,
mr.
feigin,
it
would
depend
on
how
it's
litigated.
but
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
some
fact
finding
to
be
made,
would
the
mspb
have
authority
to
find
facts?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
feigin,
they
might
well
be
the
same
claim,
but
if
the
mspb
can
decide
the
one
and
cannot
decide
the
other,
that's
a
relevant
distinction.
now,
you
might
be
right
in
what
you
said.
well,
maybe
one
answer
is
if
the
mspb
can
decide
both.
but
as
long
as
the
mspb
can
decide
the
one
or
the
other,
it
seems,
great,
i
mean,
it
seems
like
a
sensible
dividing
line.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
weird
in
another
way,
isn't
it,
mr.
feigin?
because,
can
we
really
imagine
in
the
real
world
the
mspb
deciding
that
the
selective
service
act
is
unconstitutional?
i
mean,
what
do
they
know
about
that
question?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
this
is
a
question,
and
--
and
you
can
--
i
take
the
point
that
i'm
just
talking
about
this
case.
but
this
is
a
question
about
whether
women
should
have
to
register
for
the
draft
in
the
same
way
as
men
should.
that
goes
to
defense
policy.
it
goes
to
equal
protection
law.
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
with
--
with
workplace
issues
of
the
kinds
that
the
mspb
is
expert
on.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
feigin,
could
i
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
what
actually
would
happen
in
the
mspb.
presumably
in
this
case,
what
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
do
is
to
develop
an
extensive
factual
record
showing
how
much
has
changed
in
the
military
in
terms
of
the
--
the
--
the
role
that
women
play
in
the
military.
and
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
litigate
this
kind
of
claim
without
having
such
a
record.
that's
the
entire
basis
for
--
for
arguing
that
rostker
is
outmoded,
given
current
military
operations.
so
how
could
the
--
the
plaintiff
develop
that
record
that
is
needed
to
litigate
this
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
this
is--
