mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
if
i
could
by
addressing
the
question
asked
by
justice
kagan,
which
is
why
shouldn't
the
scope
of
the
mspb's
authority
be
the
test
for
determining
whether
a
claim
can
be
filed
in
district
court?
and
i
think
using
that
as
a
test
would
lead
to
unclear
and
easily
manipulated
jurisdictional
rules.
among
other
things,
it
often
won't
be
clear
up
front
whether
the
mspb
can
resolve
an
employee's
claim
or
not.
a
claim
that
appears
at
first
blush
to
challenge
a
statute's
constitutionality
might
be
resolved,
for
instance,
by
interpreting
the
statute
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question,
which
is
something
that
the
mspb
could
do.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
i
don't
think
that's
consistent
with
the
csra,
your
honor,
because
the
way
the
csra
works
is
that
you
go
to
the
mspb
first
and
then
you
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
and
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
don't
think
it's
presuming
that
any
more
than
42
u.s.c.
405(g)
was
presuming
that
in
illinois
council
or
the
mine
act
was
presuming
that
in
thunder
basin
coal.
that
it's
often
useful
to
have
constitutional
claims
presented
to
an
agency
in
the
first
instance,
even
if
the
agency
can't
resolve
those
claims,
because
it
allows
the
agency
to
figure
out
--
for
example,
in
the
case
that
this
court
was
discussing
with
mr.
schwartz
about
circumstances
where
there
might
be
nonconstitutional
claims
and
constitutional
claims,
the
agency
might
be
able
to
moo
out
the
case
on
nonconstitutional
grounds.
the
constitutional--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that
was
true
in
illinois
council
and
some
of
the
other
cases
we
cite.
but
in
thunder
basin
the
court
was
very
clear
that
the
statute
was
facially
silent
as
to
the
preclusion
of
pre-enforcement
claims
like
the
sort
that
were
at
issue
in
thunder
basin.
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
claim
in
thunder
basin
was
precluded,
and
it
held
that
even
though
it
acknowledged
that
it
might
be
possible
that
the
constitutional
claim
that
was
raised
by
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
couldn't
be
addressed
in
first
instance
by
the
mine
commission.
now,
the
mspb
here
is
very
analogous
to
the
mine
commission.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
we
prefer
thunder
basin,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
i
think,
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
mcnary
actually
presented
a
very
specialized
circumstance
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
special
statutory
provision
in
that
case
that
limited
judicial
review
of
--
in
that
case
to
the
record
that
had
already
been
developed,
and
that's
not
true
here.
second,
the
court
was
very
concerned
in
mcnary
that
if
the
plaintiffs
weren't
allowed
to
bring
their
claims
in
district
court
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
receive
any
meaningful
judicial
review
at
all.
now,
here
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
can
get
meaningful
judicial
review
from
the
federal
circuit,
which
every
one
agrees
has
the
authority
to
resolve
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
statute.
now,
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
address
i
think
some
confusions
the
chief
justice
was
noting
over
the
meaning
of
the
term
mspb.
now,
before
getting
into
this
i'd
like
to
acknowledge
that
when
petitioner
elgin
did
bring
this
case
to
the
mspb
the
government
argued
that
the
mspb
had
no
jurisdiction.
we
have
conceded
below
and
we
concede
here
that
we
were
wrong
about
that.
we
do
not
think
elgin
should
be
prejudiced
by
the
government's
position.
if
he
were
to
file
a
motion
now
to
reopen
his
case
to
the
mspb,
the
government
would
support
that.
here's
how
it
should
have
worked
if
the
government--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--our
answer
--
our
answer--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
they
can
appeal
that
decision
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
the
government
will
again
support
the
fact
that
the
case
ought
to
be
reopened.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
let
me
now
address
what
should
have
happened
when
the
case
went
to
the
mspb.
the
mspb
would
have
had
jurisdiction
over
the
case
in
the
sense
that
the
challenge
to
the
adverse
action
is
properly
before
the
mspb.
i
think
that's
very
clear
under
5
u.s.c.
7513(d)
and
5
u.s.c.
7701
(a)
which
grant
the
mspb
jurisdiction
over
adverse
actions
under
the
csra.
now
the
mspb
would
not
be
able
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality,
would
not
be
able
to
issue
an
order
striking
down
a
federal
statute
and
to
determine
that
that
would
be
what
would
be
necessary
here
in
order
to
grant
the
plaintiff's
relief.
what
it
would
have
done
is,
first
of
all,
it
could
have
accepted
any
evidence
that
the
plaintiffs
or
the
government
wished
to
submit
on
the
constitutional
issue
in
order
to
build
up
the
administrative
record
for
review--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--yes.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--we
will
not
object
that
it's
not
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
to
decide--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
fairly
analogous,
although
not
perfectly
analogous,
to
the
fairly
common
circumstance
where,
for
example,
a
district
court
reserves
to
itself
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
an
action
and
then
delegates
to
a
magistrate
judge
decisions
on
discovery.
now
the
only
limitation--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
we
think
the
mspb
lacks
authority
to
do,
the
only
thing
is
to
issue
an
order
on
the
merits
declaring
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional.
it
is
competent
to
resolve
discovery--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
there
may
be
disputes
as
to
the
scope
of
discovery.
and
those
--
resolution
of
those
disputes
may
touch
on
the
merits.
we
think
the
mspb
can
do
all
of
that.
the
only
thing
mspb
lacks
authority
to
do,
according
to
the
mspb,
is
to
issue
an
order
striking
down
a
federal
statute
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
this
case
isn't
going
to
require
any
fact
finding
because
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
both
judges
that
have
addressed
petitioner's
arguments
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
judge
and
the
concurring
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
able
to
resolve
the
claim
without
fact
finding.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
now
i'd
like
to
add
that
in
many
cases--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
need
to
separate
out
two
things.
first,
it
is
still
our
position
that
the
mspb
has
no
authority
to
declare
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional.
now
the
government
was
taking
the
position
that
in
cases
where
an
employee
had
been
removed
pursuant
to
a
statutory
bar,
that
the
mspb
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
an
appeal
of
a
case
like
that.
and
the
reason
the
government
argued
was
not
because
the
mspb
lacked
authority
to
decide
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
although
we
believe
that,
too,
but
because
the
government
was
arguing
erroneously
that
an
employee
who
is
removed
based
on
a
statutory
bar
that
should
have
prevented
his
hiring
in
the
first
place
wasn't
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
5
u.s.c.
7511.
now
the
government
no
longer
takes
that
5
u.s.c.
7511
position.
we've
been
consistent
on
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court,
and,
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
mspb
did
properly
have
jurisdiction
over
the
action
in
this
case.
now,
when
it
goes
up
to
the
mspb,
the
ms
--
and
after
--
the
mspb
would
then
deny
relief
on
the
merits
because
it
would
lack
the
authority
to
declare
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
so
there
is
not
a
statute,
your
honor.
this
court
has
said
in
several
cases
that
administrative
agencies
generally
lack
the
authority
to
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional.
it's
clear
from
thunder
basin
that
that
isn't
a
federal
limitation
on
the
authority
of
federal
agencies.
that
is
to
say,
if
congress
wanted
to
give
an
agency
the
authority
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
it
could.
and
the
court
noted
that
the
mine
commission
in
thunder
basin
believed
it
did
have
the
authority
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
statutes,
although
the
court
didn't
reach
whether
the
mine
commission
was
correct
about
that.
and
in
this
case,
the
mspb
believes,
consistent
with
this
court's
repeated
statements,
that
it
lacks
authority
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
statutes.
now
if
the
court
decides
that
the
best
way
to
reconcile
the
scheme
would
simply
be
to
say
that
the
mspb
does
have
the
authority
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
statutes,
i
think
that
would
make
much
more
sense
than
the
position
the
petitioner
is
urging,
and
here's
an
example,
i
think,
that
illustrates
why
the
position
the
petitioners
are
urging
will
lead
to
confusion
of
jurisdictional
rules
and
manipulation
of
jurisdictional
rules.
so
if
you
imagine
two
employees
who
were
fired
by
an
employing
agency
for
leaking
information
to
the
press,
confidential
information
to
the
press,
they
both
challenge
their
removals,
but
they
both
raise
slightly
different
arguments.
the
first
one
says,
well,
i
don't
think
the
employment
statute
should
be
construed
to
allow
me
to
be
fired
for
this
reason
because
i
think
the
employment
statutes
should
be
construed
with
first
amendment
principles
in
mind
and
shouldn't
reach
this
case.
the
second
one
says,
i
concede
that
the
employment
statutes
allow
my
firing
for
this
reason,
but
i
think
those
--
i
think
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied.
now
those
are
really
the
same
claim
and--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
even
if
the
mspb
lacks
the
authority
to
strike
down
a
federal
statute,
i
still
think
it
might
be
able
to
adjudicate
the
claim
of
the
employee,
the
second
employee,
who
brings
it
as
an
as-applied
challenge
because
the
court
would
--
i'm
sorry
not
the
court
--
the
mspb
could
decide
that
case
on
the
same
constitutional
avoidance
grounds
that
are
resolved
--
that
are
urged
by
the
first
employee.
that
is,
they
really
are
the
same
case.
before
striking
down
a
statute
as
constitutional,
this
court
all
the
time,
it
instructs
lower
courts,
and
this
would
be
true
of
agencies,
too,
should
interpret
the
statutes
to
avoid
any
significant
constitutional--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
are
the
same
in
the
respect
that
as
i
was
just
saying
to
justice
kagan,
if
the
mspb--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--no,
your
honor,
but
there
may
be
ambiguity
in
a
statute
that
the
court
interprets
to
avoid
a
significant
constitutional
question.
so
maybe
i
can
give
another
example
that
might
flush
this
out
a
little
bit.
there
is
a
statute
5
u.s.c.
7311
that
bars
from
federal
employment
people
who
have
participated
in
strikes.
now
it's
easy
to
think
of
an
employee
who
raises
a
factual
or
statutory
challenge
to
that
claim.
he
says
that
what
he
did
wasn't
participating
in
a
strike,
either
factually
or
shouldn't
be
considered
participating
in
a
strike
within
the
scope
of
the
statute,
and
he
also
challenges
the
statute
on
constitutional
grounds.
and
the
most
common
case
brought
to
the
mspb,
in
our
experience,
that
raises
a
constitutional
claim
also
raises
the
sort
of
factual
and
statutory
claims
i
was
just
suggesting.
now
the
mspb
might
resolve
that
first
question
--
those
first
set
of
questions
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
by
saying
the
statute
doesn't
reach
the
conduct
that
the
particular
employee
engaged
in.
and
if
we
imagine
instead
that
the
employee
had
only
brought
the
constitutional
claim,
which
would
be
kind
of
a
strange
way
to
litigate,
because
he
would
be
giving
up
arguments
on
which
he
might
win,
i
still
think
that
the
mspb
could
decide
look,
before
we
send
this
off
to
the
federal
circuit
and
decide
that
the
only
way
we
can
grant
you
relief
is
to
say
that
a
federal
statute
is
unconstitutional,
which
is
something
we
don't
think
we
can
do,
we
should
at
least
take
a
look
at
the
statute
to
see
whether
these
somewhat
ambiguous
terms
"participate"
and
"strike"
actually
do
apply
to
your
conduct.
and
by
failing
to
give
the
mspb
the
first
crack
at
doing
that--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
in
this
case,
we
don't
think
the
constitutional
question
can
be
avoided,
and
we
don't
think
the
mspb
could
have
granted
relief.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
should
essentially
throw
everything
out
just
because
of
this
case.
their
position
is
going
to
make
for
unclear
jurisdictional
rules,
and
employees
aren't
going
to
know
where
they're
entitled
to
go
or
where
they're
supposed
to
go,
because--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
statute
does
not,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
draw
any
distinction
between
the
types
of
arguments
that
would
be
made
in
seeking
to
set
aside
an
unlawful
discharge--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
as
everyone
agrees,
and
as
mr.
schwartz
was
discussing
with
the
court,
the
mspb
does
have
expertise
on
--
in
constitutional
claims.
the
mspb
are
a
set
of
--
a
set
of
persons
that
are
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
i
think
that's
right,
justice
kagan,
but
the
csra
doesn't
draw
distinctions
between
the
types
of
arguments
that
are
being
made.
it
draws
distinctions,
as
justice
sotomayor
was
just
suggesting,
about
what
sorts
of
personnel
actions
it
covers.
and
i
think--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
don't,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
our
primary
position
is
that
the
mspb
does
not
have
that
authority.
however--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--it's
coming
from
statements
by
this
court,
and
also
statements
by
kenneth
davis
in
1958.
administrative
agency--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--no.
the
court
usually
just
sort
of
says
this
in
passing.
and
the
court--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--the
court
made
very
clear
in
thunder
basin
this
is
just
a
general
presumption
about
the
authority
of
administrative
agencies.
it
doesn't
have
to
be--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
that
treatise
is
cited
--
for
example,
by
--
the
court
cites
the
mine
commission
cases
that
themselves
cite
the
treatise.
but
the
point
is,
justice
breyer,
even
if
our
rule
does
have
a
couple
of
hiccups
with
it,
we
do
think
it
is
much
superior
to
the
rule
that
petitioners
are
urging,
because
there
are
clear
jurisdictional
rules.
we
have--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--yes,
we
agree
with
the
mspb's
position
that
it
lacks
the
authority
to
strike
down
a
statute
as
unconstitutional.
however,
if
it
is
a
difference
between
adopting
petitioners'
position
or
holding
that
the
mspb
has
the
authority
to
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional,
we
think
congress
would
have
greatly
preferred
the
latter,
because
that
preserves
the
--
the
basic
idea
of
the
csra,
which
was
to
consolidate
and
streamline
judicial
review.
this
court
recognized
in
fausto
congress
specifically
did
not
want
challenges
to
adverse
actions
to
go
through
district
court
and
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
get
a
duplicative
and
wasteful
two-layer
judicial
review.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
think
they
would
have
preferred
it
to
a
scheme
where
first
of
all,
the
claims
go
to
district
court,
which
is
precisely
what
the
csra
was
trying
to
eliminate.
and
second
of
all,
to
a
scheme
where
it
becomes
confusing
and
dependent
on
precisely
how
a
plaintiff
frames
his
argument
which
court
winds
up
entertaining
the
claim.
now--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
we
cite
several
examples
of
courts
of
appeals
deciding
constitutional
questions
in
the
first
instance,
at
pages
37
to
38
in
our
brief.
another
would
be
this
court's
decision
in
ins
v.
chadha,
the
legislative
veto
case,
which
came
up
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
said
it
didn't
have
authority
to
adjudicate
the
separation
of
powers
question.
it
was
reviewed
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
reviewed
by
this
court.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
he
would
develop
it
in
the
mspb,
either
in
the
first
instance
on
the
initial
appeal,
or
the
mspb
could
let
it
go
to
the
federal
circuit
without
having
developed
an
administrative
record.
and
the
federal
circuit
if,
unlike
either
of
the
judges
to
address
the
merits
in
this
case,
believed
that
a
factual
record
was
necessary,
it
could
remand
to
the
mspb
with
instructions
that
the
mspb
take
evidence
and
develop
it--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
if
the
court
believes
that
that
is
a
better
way
to
reconcile
the
scheme,
we
wouldn't
oppose
that
either,
but--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that
was
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
actually
going
to
be
a
fairly
rare
case
in
which
a
challenge
to
a
legislative
act,
passing
a
statute,
is
really
going
to
turn
on
some
sort
of
factual
finding--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--like
a
credibility
determination
--
like
a
credibility
determination
or
something
that's
uniquely
within
the
competence
of
a
trial
court
or
an
agency
with
trial
court-like
powers.
i
think
what
might
be
more
common,
justice
kagan,
is
that
you
might
need
to
develop
some
sort
of
administrative
record.
but
once
the
evidence
is
submitted,
the
conclusions
one
would
draw
from
that
evidence
would
be
fairly
obvious.
for
example,
in
rostker
v.
goldberg,
there
was
discovery,
there
was
evidence
submitted,
and
then
the
parties
were
able
to
stipulate
to
the
facts
that
would
set
forth
review.
so
in
this
case,
for
example,
i
don't
think
there's
really
going
to
be
a
dispute
that
the
mspb
is
going
to
have
to
resolve
about
what
sorts
of
positions
women
can
serve
in,
in
the
military.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
the
way
to
deal
with
that
would
be
to
just
have
a
very
quick
stop
in
the
mspb
which
assures
itself
yes,
this
is
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
statute.
as
the
court
recognized
in
weinberger
v.
salfi,
for
example,
it
is
useful
to
have
--
at
least
exhaust
the
claim
of
the
agency
for
that
purpose.
yes--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--there
is
not,
your
honor,
and
in
fact--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
where
i
was
going
with
this,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
mspb
has
a
special
rule,
i
believe
it's
5
c.f.r.
1201.61;
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
where
even
if
the
mspb
decided
not
to
accept
evidence
for
some
reason,
the
description
of
the
evidence
would
go
in
the
record
and
therefore
be
available
for
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
the
federal--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
the
federal
circuit
has
in
analogous
cases
decided
constitutional
claims
that
weren't
raised
in
front
of
an
agency
when
the
agency
couldn't
decide
them.
in
the
government's
view
it
would
make
sense
to
exhaust,
for
the
reasons
i
was
explaining
earlier
and
to
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
that
it
may
be
that
the
mspb
finds
that
the
statute
doesn't
really
cover
the
situation.
now
i
acknowledge
that's
not
going
to
happen
in
this
case;
it
is
clear
that
section
3328
required
these
people's
removal.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
has
recognized--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
what
should
happen
in
a
case
like
this
is
that
the
employee
appeals
to
the
mspb
and
says
nothing
at
all.
the
employee
should
appeal
to
the
mspb
and
at
least
say
what
his
constitutional
claim
is,
and
the
benefit
of
that
as
the
court
has
recognized
in,
for
example,
weinberger
v.
salfi,
is
that
the
agency
can
assure
itself,
yes,
it's
a
constitutional
claim;
it's
beyond
my
authority
to
resolve
and
there
is
no
other
way
for
me
to
resolve
it.
another
benefit
of
presenting
these
claims
to
the
agency
is
the
mspb
hasn't
been
crystal
clear
about
exactly
where
its
authority
begins
and
ends;
and
neither
the
federal
circuit
nor
this
court
has
addressed
that
question
at
all.
and
allowing
the
agency
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
whether
it
has
the
authority
to
grant
the
plaintiff
the
relief
he
is
seeking
has
a
great
benefit
of
clarifying
what
the
scope
of
the
mspb's
authority
is.
it
makes
a
lot
more
sense
for
the
mspb
and
the
federal
circuit
to
be
deciding
what
the
scope
of
the
mspb's
authority
is
than
it
is
to
file
a
claim
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
and
have
that
district
court
and
then
the
first
circuit
debating
about
what
the
proper
scope
of
the
mspb's
authority
is.
i
think
the
csra
expresses
a
clear
preference
that
appeals
of
adverse
actions
like
this
go
through
the
mspb
and
to
the
federal
circuit,
so
that
they
can
decide
those
kinds
of
questions.
again--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--in
salfi,
your
honor?
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that
would
have
been
in
district
court.
however
under
42
u.s.c.
405(g),
which
was
at
issue
in
salfi
and
illinois
council,
the
district
court
is
performing
essentially
appellate
style
review
of
the
agency's
findings.
that
is,
the
preferred
course
is
that
any
additional
fact-findings
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
made
on
remand
and
not
taken
by
the
district
court.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
think
it
would
still
be
the
preferred
course
that
the
agency
would
do
any
further
fact-finding
that
would
be
necessary
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
under
405(g),
rather
than
1331,
the
preferred
form
of
fact-finding
is
in
the
agency,
and
remands
to
the
agency
for
further
fact-finding
whether
than
development
of
the
facts
in
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
in
any
event,
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
thunder
basin,
for
example,
where
review
in
the
first
instance
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
adequate
authority
to
give
meaningful
judicial
review
to
a
constitutional
claim
that
an
agency,
in
that
case
the
mine
commission,
by
hypothesis
could
not
decide.
thank
you.
