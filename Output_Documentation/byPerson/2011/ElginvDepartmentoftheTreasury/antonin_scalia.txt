justice
antonin
scalia
in
--
in
those
cases
did
the
--
did
the
plaintiffs
also
have
nonconstitutional
claims
which
they
were
pursuing
in
the
federal
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
--
that's
the
problem
here.
i
mean,
yes,
if
all
you
have
is
a
constitutional
claim,
i
suppose
the
system
you
propose
would
work.
you
go
to
the
district
court.
but
where
--
where
you
have
both,
it's
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
whether
that
reason
was
justifiable.
and
isn't
it
the
case
that
whenever
the
reason
is
an
unconstitutional
reason,
you
would
have
an
as-applied
challenge,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
do
you
need
a
facial
challenge
in
addition?
i
thought
that
we
always
try
to
do
as-applied
first
and
facial
second.
so
why
isn't
it
enough
that
you
can
go
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board
and
then
to
the
federal
circuit
saying
that
this
action
was
wrong
and
not
allowed
under
the
statute?
and
--
and
if
--
if
the
reason
it
was
wrong
was
that
it
was
unconstitutional,
what's
--
what's
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
is
that
wrong?
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the,
what
the
administrative
procedure
act
says,
that
if
there
is
no
other
effective
means
of
judicial
review
you
get
judicial
review
under
the
apa.
these
people
have
no
effective
right
because
they
can't
go
to
the
mspb
and
can't
go
to
the
federal
circuit,
so
they
have
rights
in
the
district
court.
that's
not
a
problem.
the
problem
is
the
people
who
do
have
rights
to
go
to
the
merit
system
protection
board,
right,
who
have
constitutional
claims
based
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute?
mr.
schwartz,
well
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that's
--
that's
entirely
logical.
fausto
in
effect
said
that
the
statutory
structure
simply
provides
no
cause
of
action
for
these
people,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
not
entitled
to--
anything.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the,
in
the
civil
service
laws
that
say
these
people
are
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protections.
so
i
don't
think
that
--
that
fausto
rules
this
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
those
that
i
say
that
people
not
covered
by
appeals
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
they
can
bring
those
constitutional
claims,
even
though
they
can't
bring
statutory
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
you're
taking
--
i'm
saying
that's
true
only
with
respect
to
those
people
who
have
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
you're
going
further.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
even
the
people
who
can
appeal
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
right,
can
go
directly
to
the
district
court.
that's
a
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
twell,
i
will
object.
what
is
the
agency
taking
evidence
on
an
issue
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide?
that
is
absolutely
weird.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
like
that
at
all.
that's
ridiculous.
send
it
back
to
an
agency
that
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
question?
make
fact-findings
on
this
--
on
this
question
over
which
you
have
no
jurisdiction.
can
you
give
any
example
where
--
where
that
occurs
elsewhere?
why
--
why
wouldn't
the
--
the
preferable
course
be
to
appoint
a
master,
have
the
federal
circuit
appoint
a
master
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
but,
but
--
but
this
is
not
an
area
that's
within
their
expertise
to
decide.
what
do
they
know
about
--
about
the
military?
and
when
is
that
ever
--
ever
relevant
to
anything
that
they
decide?
it's
utterly
irrelevant
to
their
work.
and
you're
telling
them
to
take--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wait.
you're
--
you're
actually
proposing
that
you
have
to
exhaust
questions
that
the
agency
has
no
authority
to
decide?
justice
antonin
scalia
curiouser
and
curiouser.
if
you
don't
bring
before
the
agency
a
question
that
the
agency
says
it
has
no
authority
to
decide,
you
have
forfeited
your
ability?
