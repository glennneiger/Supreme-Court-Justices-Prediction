justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
civil
service
reform
act
or
csra
established
a
comprehensive
system
of
administrative
and
judicial
review
for
federal
employees
who
wished
to
challenge
adverse
employment
actions,
including
removals
from
federal
service.
a
removed
employee
may
appeal
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board
which
is
authorized
to
order
reinstatement,
back
pay,
and
attorneys
fees
to
prevailing
employees.
if
the
employee
is
not
satisfied
with
the
boards
decision,
he
may
seek
judicial
review
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
petitioners
are
former
federal
employees
who
were
discharged
pursuant
to
section
3328
of
title
5,
a
statute
that
bars
from
federal
employment,
persons
who
fail
to
register
for
the
drafts.
only
petitioner
elgin
appealed
his
termination
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
elgin
argued
that
section
3328
was
an
unconstitutional
bill
of
attainder
and
unconstitutionally
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
sex
since
only
men
are
required
to
register
for
the
draft.
the
board
dismissed
elgins
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
concluding
that
a
person,
whose
employment
was
absolutely
barred
by
statute,
was
not
an
employee
with
a
right
to
review
before
the
board.
rather
than
seek
judicial
review
before
the
federal
circuit,
elgin
joined
the
other
petitioners
in
filing
this
action
in
federal
district
court.
petitioners
raised
the
same
constitutional
claims
to
section
3328
and
sought
reinstatement
to
federal
employment
and
back
pay.
the
district
court
denied
petitioners'
claims
on
the
merits.
on
appeal,
the
first
circuit
vacated
the
judgment
and
remanded,
instructing
the
district
court
to
dismiss
petitioners
suit
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
in
a
holding
that
neither
party
challenges
here,
the
court
of
appeals
first
included
that
despite
the
statutory
bar
to
their
employment,
petitioners
were
federal
employees
entitled
to
review
under
the
csra.
the
court
of
appeals
then
concluded
that
the
csra
review
scheme
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
employees
challenging
removal,
even
those
who
do
so
by
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
the
merit
systems
protection
board's
past
holding
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
consider
a
statute's
constitutionality,
but
the
court
concluded
that
this
did
not
exempt
petitioners
from
the
csras
exclusive
scheme
because
the
federal
circuit
could
adjudicate
--
federal
circuit
could
adjudicate
petitioners
constitutional
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
first
circuit.
whereas
here,
a
statute
challenged
--
channels
judicial
review
of
constitutional
claims
to
a
particular
court
that
can
perform
meaningful
review,
we
conclude
that
congress
intended
that
avenue
of
judicial
review
to
be
exclusive
when
congress
intent
is
fairly
discernible
in
the
statutory
text
structure
and
purpose.
the
csra
sets
out
an
elaborate
--
in
elaborate
detail
the
system
of
review
before
the
board
and
the
federal
circuit
and
this
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
employees
to
access
another
avenue
of
review
in
district
court.
there
is
no
textual
support
for
petitioners
contention
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
covered
employees
and
employment
actions
from
the
csra
scheme
simply
because
the
nature
of
the
employee's
claim
is
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
federal
statute.
under
the
csra,
the
availability
of
review
turns
on
the
type
of
employee
and
adverse
action,
not
on
the
type
of
legal
claim
at
issue.
furthermore,
the
purpose
of
the
csra
was
to
provide
a
streamline
review
scheme
that
would
eliminate
employee
challenges
in
federal
courts
across
the
country.
that
purpose
would
severely
undermined
if
employees
with
constitutional
claims
to
challenge
adverse
employment
action
in
district
courts.
we
reject
petitioner's
contention
that
their
claims
cannot
receive
meaningful
review
within
the
csra
scheme,
even
assuming
that
the
board
cannot
decide
their
constitutional
challenges,
the
federal
circuit
can
do
so.
we
also
disagree
with
petitioner's
argument
that
their
claims
are
wholly
collateral
to
the
csra
scheme
and
outside
of
the
boards
expertise
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
supervisor
employee
disputes
that
the
board
ordinarily
adjudicates.
petitioner's
claims
are
the
vehicle
by
which
they
seek
to
overturn
their
removal
from
federal
employment
and
obtain
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
the
board
routinely
addresses
challenges
to
removal
and
requests
for
such
relief
and
petitioner's
appeals
present
issues
such
as
constructive
discharge
to
which
the
board
may
apply
its
expertise.
for
these
reasons,
we
conclude
that
the
csra
precludes
district
court
jurisdiction
in
this
case.

alito

a
dissenting
opinion
in
which

and
kagan
