v.
cain.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
andrieu.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
you
could
argue,
presumably
you
did
argue,
that
before
the
jury,
and
that
would
be
compelling
evidence
for
the
jury.
and
if
you
were
the
defense
lawyer
you
really
would
like
to
have
that
statement
where
he
said:
i
couldn't
identify
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
you've
lost
me
there.
but
he
says
"i
can't
identify
anyone",
smith
is
out
of
that
group
already?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
excuse
me.
i
can't
identify
everyone
or
everyone?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
--
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
the
idea
was
they
were
going
to
kill
everybody
who
might
have
seen
them
inside.
their
only
worry
would
be
someone
who
would
see
them
outside,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can,
very
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shanmugam,
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
10-8145,
juan
smith
versus
burl
cain.
juan
smith
was
convicted
of
murdering
five
people
during
an
armed
robbery.
at
smith's
trial,
a
single
eyewitness
linked
smith
to
the
crime.
no
other
witnesses
and
no
physical
evidence
implicated
smith.
smith
later
obtained
files
from
the
police
investigation
of
the
crime.
those
files
showed
that
the
key
eyewitness
had
told
the
police
among
other
things
that
he
“could
not
id
anyone
because
he
could
not
see
their
faces”
and
that
he
“would
not
know
them
if
he
saw
them."
the
witness
nonetheless
had
confidently
identified
smith
in
court.
in
1963,
we
decided
a
case
called
brady
versus
maryland.
in
that
case,
we
explained
that
prosecutors
may
not
withhold
from
criminal
defendants
evidence
that
is
favorable
to
the
defence
and
material
to
determining
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence.
the
state
in
this
case
acknowledges
as
it
must
that
the
witness'
statements
were
not
given
to
smith
and
that
those
statements
were
helpful
to
him.
the
only
question,
therefore,
is
whether
the
statements
were
material.
we
have
said
that
statements
are
material
if
there
is
a
“reasonable
probability'
that
the
result
of
the
trial
would
have
been
different
had
the
evidence
been
disclosed.
now,
when
the
only
evidence
linking
a
defendant
to
a
crime
is
an
identification
by
a
single
eyewitness
and
that
witness
had
previously
told
the
police
that
he
could
not
id
anyone
because
he
could
not
see
their
faces,
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
withheld
evidence
is
material.
the
state
contends
that
the
jury
might
have
disregarded
smith's
undisclosed
statements
because
the
witness
had
also
--
the
statements
that
weren't
disclosed
to
smith
because
the
witness
had
also
told
police
shortly
after
the
crime
that
he
could
make
an
identification
of
one
of
the
shooters.
according
to
the
state,
the
witness'
statement
that
he
could
not
see
the
perpetrators'
faces
meant
that
he
could
not
see
the
faces
of
perpetrators
other
than
the
one
he
could
identify
and
the
state
claims
that
the
witness'
later
statement
that
he
would
not
know
the
perpetrators
if
he
saw
them
can
be
explained
by
his
legitimate
fear
of
possible
retaliation,
but
all
that
only
leaves
as
to
speculate
about
which
of
the
witness'
contradictory
statements
the
jury
would
have
believed,
the
statements
in
which
the
witness
said
he
could
identify
smith
or
those
in
which
he
said
he
could
not.
because
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
jury
would
have
believed
the
witness'
statements
that
he
could
not
identify
smith,
we
can
have
no
confidence
in
smith's
conviction.
the
judgment
of
the
orleans
parish
criminal
district
court
of
louisiana
is
accordingly
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
