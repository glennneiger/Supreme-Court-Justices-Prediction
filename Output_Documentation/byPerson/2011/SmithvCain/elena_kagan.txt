justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shanmugam,
just
a
quick
one.
was
--
is
all
the
evidence
that
you're
discussing
here
today,
was
that
presented
to
the
state
post-conviction
court?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
andrieu,
if
i
could
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
was
the
problem
here
that
the
prosecutors
never
received
these
statements
from
the
police
officers,
or
did
the
prosecutors
make
a
determination
similar
to
the
kind
of
arguments
that
you're
making
today
--
make
a
determination
that
these
statements
simply
should
not
be
turned
over
because
they
are
not
material?
justice
elena
kagan
is
it
the
view
of
the
prosecutor's
office
that
because
those
materials
were
turned
over
to
the
judge,
assuming
that
they
were
turned
over
to
the
judge,
that
that
obviates
the
brady
obligation?
is
that
the
view
of
the
prosecutor's
office?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
andrieu,
did
your
office
ever
consider
just
confessing
error
in
this
case?
justice
elena
kagan
did
your
office
ever
consider
just
confessing
error
in
this
case?
you've
had
a
bunch
of
time
to
think
about
it.
do
you
know?
we
took
cert
a
while
ago.
i'm
just
wondering
whether
you've
ever
considered
confessing
error.
