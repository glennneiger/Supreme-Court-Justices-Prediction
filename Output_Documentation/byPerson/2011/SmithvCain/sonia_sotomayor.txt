justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counselor,
your
argument
now
and
in
your
brief
suggests
that
you're
relying
most
heavily
on
the
failure
to
provide
the
impeachment
materials
of
the
only
witness
to
this
crime
and
the
only
piece
of
evidence
that
ties
your
client
to
the
crime.
but
you
also
mention
other
things,
and
respondents
spend
90
percent
of
their
brief
arguing
against
the
other
things.
but
i
just
want
to
clarify
those
other
things.
number
one,
was
the
testimony
mixed
testimony
about
whether
the
assailants
wore
a
mask
across
their
face
or
over
their
entire
head?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
best
take
on
what
the
evidence
showed
that
was
presented
on
that
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you
something?
who
determines
that
issue
of
whether
that's
a
dying
declaration?
do
we
determine
that
in
deciding
whether
the
withholding
of
the
brady
materials
was
harmful
or
not?
do
we
give
deference
to
the
lower
court's
determination
of
that?
do
they
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
a
dying
declaration.
what's
the
standard
on
something
like
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
mr.
mims
was
the
neighbor
who
saw
the
two
--
there
were
three
assailants
in
total,
right,
and
two
left
the
scene?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
right
that
this--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
is
--
this
group
or
gang,
all
of
them
had
gold
teeth
and
faded
hair
cuts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
short,
faded
hair
cuts
and
gold
teeth
were
not
a
unique
characteristic.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'd
just
like
to
go
back
to
that
because
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
argument.
both
the
ballistics
expert
at
trial
said
that
the
casings
were
consistent
with
a
9-millimeter,
and
i
know
that
boatner
said
that
it
was
a
9-millimeter
that
was
used,
and
the
issue
was
whether
anybody
would
call
a
mac
gun
a
handgun
as
opposed
to
an
automatic
pistol,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
why
boatner
waited
2
weeks
to
--
or
never
told
the
police
that
the
face
that
he
saw
in
the
newspaper
was
the
face
of
his
assailant?
i
--
i
--
as
i
understand
the
facts,
he
says
he
saw
the
newspaper,
recognized
his
assailant
and
remained
silent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
wasn't
until
they
presented
him
with
the
line-up
including
mr.
smith's
face
that
he
identified
mr.
smith.
what's
the
reason
for
the
delay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
what
turned
--
what
changed
his
mind
once
police
showed
him
the
line-up.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
if--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
if
--
could
the
jury
be
entitled
to
reject
that
conclusion?
they
have
four
statements
by
this
man
who
ronquillo
described
as
very
coherent,
very
with
it
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
would
a
jury
be
entitled
to
--
to
reject
that
excuse
by
ronquillo?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
they
were
entitled
to
do
that,
why
would
the
absence
of
four
statements
that
i
can't
identify
someone
not
have
been
an
argument
that
defense
counsel
could
have
used,
number
one,
and
that
have
a
reasonable
probability
of
making
a
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
different
hours.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
different
hours.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
to
different
officers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
two
statements.
my
math
is
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
have
--
you
have
to
supply
statements
by
a
witness
when
they
take
the
stand,
don't
you?
those
are
immaterial?
don't
you
have
to
turn
over--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--not
in
the
state
of
louisiana?
you
don't
have
to
turn
over
witness
statements
when
they
are
taking
the
stand?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
--
so
are
you
claiming
that
the
judge's
failure
to
catch
these
inconsistencies
excuses
your
brady
obligation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
there
a
violation
under
our
holding
in
kyles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
a
brady
violation
under
our
holding
in
kyles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
explain
why
what
is
on
its
face
seemingly
inconsistent
statements
are
not
required
to
be
turned
over.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand
how
he
becomes
the
arbiter
of
what's
brady.
you
said
to
me
earlier
that
a
jury
would
be
entitled
to
reject
his
conclusion.
all
right.
tell
me
what
--
how
his
conclusion
makes
it
non-brady
if
a
juror
could
decide
differently.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
two
components
to
brady,
should
they
have
been
turned
over?
and
if
they
had,
is
there
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
outcome?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
should
they
have
been
turned
over?
that's
the
question
that
i
think
my
colleague
asked
you,
and
you're
saying
no.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right,
now
articulate
what
legal
theory--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
say
these
are
not,
these
are
not
materials
that
needed
to
be
turned
over,
when
they
say
"could
not
id;
would
not
know
them
if
i
saw
them;
can't
tell
if
had
faces
covered;
didn't
see
anyone.
"
that's
one
of
the
notes.
the
other
one,
"i
don't
know
how
many
that
i
saw;
i
was
too
scared
to
look
at
anybody.
"
and--
what
makes
any
of
those
statements--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
is
all
the
jury
argument.
tell
me
why
they
didn't
on
their
face
constitute
brady
materials
that
needed
to
be
turned
over.
what's
the
legal
principle
that
doesn't
make
them
brady?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
my
worry
is
the
following.
you've
read
cullen--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
read
cullen.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
read
the
dissent
in
cullen.
there
has
been
serious
accusations
against
the
practices
of
your
office,
not
yours
in
particular
but
prior
ones.
it
is
disconcerting
to
me
that
when
i
asked
you
the
question
directly
should
this
material
have
been
turned
over,
you
gave
an
absolute
no.
it
didn't
need
to
be.
it
would
have
been
prudent,
but
it
didn't
need
to
be.
that's
really
troubling.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
second
prong
of
brady.
i
said
there
were
two
prongs
to
brady.
do
you
have
to
turn
it
over,
and
second,
does
it
cause
harm.
and
the
first
one
you
said
not.
that
--
it
is
somewhat
disconcerting
that
your
office
is
still
answering
equivocally
on
a
basic
obligation
as
one
that
requires
you
to
have
turned
these
materials
over--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--whether
it
caused
harm
or
not.
