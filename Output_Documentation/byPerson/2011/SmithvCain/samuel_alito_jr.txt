justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
aren't
you
exaggerating
a
little
bit
about
the
value
of
the
impeachment
evidence
regarding
boatner?
my
understanding
is
that
he
made
his
first
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
couldn't
identify
anybody
at
the
scene,
when
he
had
been
at
the
scene
where
five
people
that
he
knew
very
well
had
been
killed.
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
a
big
gash
on
his
head.
he
was
questioned
at
the
scene,
and
at
that
time
--
this
was
in
the
evening
--
he
said:
i
can't
identify
anybody.
but
then
later
that
very
day,
wasn't
it?
that
very
evening,
after
midnight,
he
was
questioned
at
the
police
station.
am
i
correct.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
at
that
point
he
gave
a
description.
he
did
make
an
--
he
did
provide
a
description
of
the
person
that
he
said
was
the
one
who
first
came
through
the
door.
so,
you
know,
that
--
i
don't
know
--
and
then
later,
he
said
he
--
there
were
statements
to
the
effect
that
he
couldn't
identify
anybody.
but
in
light
of
the
fact
that
he
did
provide
a
pretty,
you
know,
somewhat
detailed
description
on
the
very
evening
of
the
event,
doesn't
that
--
aren't
you
exaggerating
when
you
say
that
he
said
numerous
times
--
the
effect
of
these
statements
that
he
couldn't--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
may
be
true,
but
if
you
were
a
juror
and
boatner
testified
and
he
was
cross-examined
and
they
attempted
to
impeach
him
based
on
his
failure
to
make
an
identification
right
at
the
scene
and
he
said,
well,
that
was
because
five
of
my
friends
had
just
been
killed
and
i
was
lying
on
the
floor
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
shot
too
and
i
had
a
big
gash
on
my
head,
and
then
a
couple
of
hours
later
when
i
collected
myself
and
they
asked
me
the
same
question
at
the
police
station
i
provided
a
description
and
didn't
say
i
couldn't
identify
anybody,
do
you
think
jurors
would
just
dismiss
that
and
say,
well,
he
couldn't
identified
him
at
the
scene
so
he
must
have
been
lying
when
he
identified
--
when
he
provided
a
description
later
at
the
police
station?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the
defense
have
any
theory
as
to
why
boatner
would
lie
about
whether
he
could
identify
this
individual?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
--
but
the
impact
of
your
impeachment
evidence
would
be
related
certainly
to
if
a
juror
would
ask:
well,
why
would
he
lie
about
this?
and
i'm
--
i'm
just
asking,
did
the
defense
have
any
theory
about
what
his
motive
would
be
about
whether
he
could
identify
somebody,
whether
this
first
person
had
a
mask
or
not.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
first
time
he
--
he
said
that
the
person
wasn't
masked
and
provided
a
description
was
long
before
he
saw
any
mug
shots.
it
was
the
evening
of
the
event.
it
was
when
he
was
questioned
at
the
police
station.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
by
doing
that
he's
saying
this
person
wasn't
wearing
a
mask.
that's
the
critical
point.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
on
that
point,
the
state
says
that
you're
drawing
a
meaningless
distinction
between
a
hand
--
a
9-millimeter
handgun
and
a
9-millimeter
automatic
pistol.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
explain
how
this
--
how
this
took
place?
you
have
a
case
in
which
you're
--
you're
relying
almost
entirely
on
the
testimony
of
one
witness,
and
you
have
these
notes
that
were
taken
by,
and
are
presumably
in
the
possession
of
the
lead
investigator.
wouldn't
any
prosecutor
ask
the
--
the
lead
--
the
lead
investigator,
do
you
have
any
statements
of
this
witness?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
have
to
be
examined,
and
if
there's
anything
in
them
that's
--
that
is
impeachable
material,
they
have
to
be
turned
over
to
the
defense.
and
under
louisiana
laws,
is
there
are
a
rule
that
requires
the
turning
over
of
statements
by
witnesses,
prior
statements
by
witnesses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
is
that
reflected
in
the
record?
i--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
you
said
in
your
brief
was
that
the
judge
determined
that
the
supplemental
report
relating
to
the
north
roman
street
murders
contains
no
brady
material.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
didn't
understand
the
record
to
be
that
all
of
boatner's
statements,
that
all
the
statements
of
boatner
that
we
are
concerned
about
now
were
examined
by
the
judge
before--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--before
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
record
reflects
that
in
where?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
is
your
understanding
that
the
--
that
all
of
boatner's,
all
the
notes
about
boatner's
statements
were
turned
over
to
the
judge
before
trial
for
in
camera
inspection?
