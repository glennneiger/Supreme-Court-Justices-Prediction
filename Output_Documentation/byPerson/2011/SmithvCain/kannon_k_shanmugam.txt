mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
brady
v.
maryland,
this
court
established
the
now-familiar
principle
that
the
prosecution
must
hand
over
all
favorable
material
evidence
to
the
defense
before
trial.
this
case
presents
a
flagrant
violation
of
that
principle.
the
orleans
parish
district
attorney's
office
produced
almost
no
relevant
evidence
to
the
defense
before
petitioner's
trial,
and
petitioner
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
based
solely
on
the
testimony
of
a
single
eyewitness.
unbeknownst
to
the
defense,
however,
that
eyewitness
had
told
the
police
on
multiple
occasions
that
he
could
not
identify
any
of
the
perpetrators
or,
as
he
put
it,
that
he
would
not
know
them
if
he
saw
them.
the
suppression
of
those
statements
alone
justifies
a
new
trial,
but
the
district
attorney's
office
in
this
case
also
engaged
in
the
wholesale
suppression
of
statements
of
numerous
other
witnesses,
statements
that
further
undermined
the
sole
eyewitness
identification
of
petitioner
and,
more
broadly,
cast
doubt
on
petitioner's
involvement
and
role
in
the
shooting.
if
all
of
that
information
had
been
disclosed
to
the
defense
before
trial,
the
jury
surely
would
have
viewed
this
case
in
a
completely
different
light.
the
trial
court
therefore
erred
by
rejecting
petitioner's
brady
claim,
and
its
judgment
should
be
reversed.
in
our
view,
in
order
to
conclude
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
here,
this
court
need
do
nothing
more
than
to
consider
the
suppressed
statements
of
the
key
eyewitness,
larry
boatner.
respondent
concedes
that
those
statements
were
withheld
from
the
defense
before
trial,
and
argues
only
that
the
failure
to
disclose
those
statements
was
not
prejudicial.
those
statements,
however,
could
not
have
more
clearly
contradicted
boatner's
confident
identification
of
petitioner
at
trial--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
correct.
the
basis
for
boatner's
identification
was
that
he
saw
a
photograph
in
the
new
orleans
newspaper
of
petitioner.
it
was
in
connection
with
an
article
describing
the
shootings
and
suggesting
that
petitioner
was
one
of
the
suspects
in
the
case.
and
that
was
what
led
to
his
prior
identification
out
of
court.
but
just
to
be
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
we
are
not
arguing
today
that
the
identification
was
somehow
constitutionally
problematic.
at
most,
we
are
arguing
that
the
identification
was
of
questionable
validity
in
light
of
the
fact
that
boatner
had
only
a
limited
opportunity
to
see
the
perpetrators
and
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
led
to
his
identification.
now,
even
if
his
identification
were
more
clearly
reliable,
our
argument
today
would
be
the
same.
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
in
which
the
sole
basis
for
linking
the
defendant
to
the
crime
is
the
testimony
of
a
single
eyewitness,
and
there
is
evidence
that
the
single
eyewitness
said
on
multiple
occasions
that
he
couldn't
identify
anyone,
we
believe
that,
absent
extraordinary
circumstances,
that
will
be
sufficient
to--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
alito,
it
is
true
that
boatner
provided
identifying
details
in
the
later
statement
that
night.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
they
were
relatively
limited
identifying
details,
simply
the
fact
that
the
first
man
through
the
door
had
a
low
cut
haircut
and
gold
teeth.
and
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
those
were
characteristics
shared
by
numerous
other
suspects
in
the
case.
but
i
think
more
broadly,
with
regard
to
both
sets
of
statements
at
issue
here,
the
state's
explanations
for
those
statements
are
at
best
plausible.
and
we
really
think
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
in
which
the
evidence
on
its
face
is
so
clearly
of
high
exculpatory
or
impeaching
values,
it
takes
something
more
than
that.
it
is
not
sufficient
for
respondent
to
argue
here
simply
that,
even
taking
into
account
these
statements,
a
rational
juror
could
still
reach
the
same
result
and
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
here.
because
this
court
made
clear
in
kyles
v.
whitley
that
the
standard
for
brady
claims
is
not
a
jackson
v.
virginia
type
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
standard.
so
again,
where
you
have
statements
on
their
face
are
not
simply
statements
calling
a
witness'
credibility
into
question,
but
statements
that
really
directly
contradict
the
confident
in-court
identification,
it
would
take
an
exceedingly
persuasive
explanation
for
those
statements
to
defeat
a
showing
of
materiality.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes,
that's
correct.
and
this
court
made
clear
in
kyles
v.
whitley
that
that's
not
a
more
likely
than
not
standard.
that
is
essentially
the
same
standard
that
this
court
has
articulated
for
prejudice
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
under
strickland
v.
washington,
and
by
now
it's
a
quite
clearly
established
standard.
and
again
it
requires
something
less
than
a
showing
of
more
likely
than
not
and
perhaps
something
slightly
more
than
the
showing
required
for
harmless
error
under
chapman
v.
california.
but
i
do
want
to
touch
upon
the
state's
explanations
for
these
statements
and
explain
very
briefly
why
we
think
that
those
explanations
are
frankly
not
even
plausible.
with
regard
to
the
first
statement
to
which
justice
alito
referred,
the
statement
that
was
made
at
the
scene
approximately
half
an
hour
after
initial
--
officers
initially
responded
to
the
scene.
the
state's
argument
is
that
boatner
was
somehow
too
traumatized
to
make
an
identification
at
the
time.
but
not
only
did
boatner
not
so
testify
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
--
in
fact
he
testified
that
he
couldn't
recall
the
statement
at
all
--
but
the
very
officer
who
took
the
statement
himself
testified
at
trial
in
this
case
that
at
the
time
of
the
statement
boatner
was,
quote,
"coherent
and
articulated
very
well
the
events
that
transpired.
"
and
that
is
at
pages
137
to
138
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
alito,
i
think
that
it's
possible
that
a
juror
could
credit
that
explanation
in
any
retrial,
though--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but
even
if
we
didn't
have
the
march
6th
statement
or
statements,
i
would
frankly
be
happy
to
take
my
chances
with
the
jury,
even
with
regard
solely
to
the
march
1st
statement,
in
light
of
that
testimony
of
officer
ronquillo
that
boatner
was
in
fact
coherent,
articulated
very
well
the
events
that
transpired
just
like
any
witness,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
so
again--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--we
don't
think
that
it's
our
burden
to
show
that
no
juror
could
credit
the
state's
explanation.
it's
simply
that
we
think
that
that
explanation
doesn't
hold
water.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
there
were--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--there
was
some
degree
of
variation
in
what
the
witnesses
said.
now,
in
the
main
we
are
talking
again
about
statements
that
were
withheld.
and
i
want
to
lay
out
those
statements
very
briefly
if
i
may.
there
were
two
eyewitnesses
who
made
statements
to
the
police
indicating
that
some
or
all
of
the
perpetrators,
including
the
first
man
through
the
door,
were
wearing
masks.
those
were
the
statements
of
shaelita
russel
and
the
statement
of
dale
mims.
now,
with
regard
to
the
statement
of
shaelita
russell
--
and
this
was
what
we
believe
was
the
dying
declaration
that
she
made
at
the
scene
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
having
been
shot
multiple
times
--
russell
said
she
saw
people
barge
into
the
kitchen,
one
had
a
black
cloth
across
the
face,
first
one
through
the
door.
so
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
lower
court
did
not
make
such
a
determination
in
this
case
on
this
or
any
of
the
other
evidentiary
issues
that
respondent
now
advances,
at
least
in
part,
because
it
does
not
appear
that
respondent
advanced
any
of
those
arguments
below.
but
i
think
more
broadly,
justice
sotomayor,
in
terms
of
the
role
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
considering
a
brady
claim,
this
court
hasn't
quite
spoken
to
the
specific
issue
of
whether
a
brady
court
is
supposed
to
itself
make
an
evidentiary
determination
where
there
is
a
question
about
admissibility,
but
the
closest
that
this
court
came
was
in
wood
v.
bartholomew,
in
which
this
court
indicated
that
with
regard
to
brady
material,
it
either
has
to
itself
be
admissible
or
be
reasonably
likely
to
lead
to
admissible
evidence.
and
the
court's
reasoning
in
wood
v.
bartholomew
was
somewhat
spare
on
that
score.
that
was
a
summary
reversal
and
a
per
curiam
opinion.
but
i
do
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
brady
court
to
make
that
determination
itself
or
at
a
minimum
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
it
appears
that
it's
reasonably
likely
that
the
evidence
would
be
admissible.
here
we
really
don't
think
that
it's
a
close
question,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
statement
of
shaelita
russell,
because
the
context
of
the
handwritten
notes
makes
clear
that
the
statement
was
taken
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
shaelita
russell
was
taken
to
the
hospital
approximately
a
half
an
hour
after
the
shootings
occurred.
she
told
two
witnesses
that
she
believed
that
she
was
dying
and
so
under
the
law
on
dying
declarations
--
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
law
is
any
different
in
louisiana
from
the
federal
system
or
the
49
other
states
--
that
would
comfortably
satisfy
that
requirement.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
three
or
four
assailants.
and
mims
himself,
in
all
candor,
was
a
little
bit
inconsistent
on
that
point.
but
he
consistently
said
both
in
the
handwritten
notes
and
in
his
testimony
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
all
of
the
assailants,
however
many
there
were,
were
wearing
masks
and
that
he
saw
them
as
they
were
getting
into
the
car.
he
didn't
say
anything
further
other
than
that
the
masks
were
ski-type
masks.
but
the
state's
argument
with
regard
to
the
materiality
of
mims's
statement
is
that
it
is
possible
that
the
men
would
not
have
been
wearing
masks
when
they
entered
the
house
to
allegedly
commit
the
armed
robbery
and
therefore
the
fact
that
boatner
saw
the
first
man
unmasked
can
be
reconciled
with
his
statement.
and
again,
we
would
be
happy
to
take
our
chances
with
the
jury
and
make
the
argument
that
that
would
be
an
exceedingly
unconventional
way
to
go
about
committing
an
armed
robbery.
and
again
with
regard
to
the
russell
and
mims
statements,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
we
view
those
statements
as
going
directly
to
and
contradicting
boatner's
in-court
identification.
and
so
in
some
sense
we
view
those
statements
as
being
of
a
piece
with
boatner's
own
prior
statements
in
which
he
indicated
that
he
could
not
identify
anyone
and
that
he
would
not--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--first
of
all,
justice
alito,
it
would
of
course
not
be
the
defense's
burden
in
any
subsequent
retrial
to
come
up
with
a
theory
of
its
own.
the
defense
could
simply
argue,
as
it
did
at
the
first
trial,
that
the
prosecution
simply
didn't
bear
its
burden
on
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
as
this
court
will
be
aware
from
its
recent
consideration
of
eyewitness
evidence,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
from
the
fact
that
an
eyewitness
identification
is
mistaken
that
the
eyewitness
was
somehow
lying
about
it.
it
may
very
well
have
been
that
boatner
made
a
mistaken
identification
in
good
faith
out
of
a
desire
to
identify
the
person
who
killed
several
of
his
friends.
and
indeed,
as
the
amicus
brief
of
the
innocence
project
explains
in
this
case,
there
is
a
phenomenon
known
as
mug
shot
exposure
effect,
where
an
individual
who
sees
a
mug
shot
in
some
other
context
is
more
likely
to
identify
that
same
person
when
confronted
with
a
subsequent
line-up.
of
course,
where,
as
here,
the
individual
is
exposed
to
the
mug
shot
for
the
first
time
in
seeing
a
newspaper
article
that
depicts
the
individual
in
question
and
suggests
that
that
individual
is
a
suspect
in
the
crime,
it
would
not
at
all
be
unusual
for
the
individual
when
confronted
with
that
photograph
again
in
a
line-up
a
few
weeks
later
to
pick
that
individual
out.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
on
the
evening
of
the
event
he
provided
those
limited
details
about
the
gold
teeth
and
the
low-cut
haircut.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
that
may
suggest
that
the
person
was
not
wearing
a
mask.
of
course,
it's
possible
that
the
person
somehow
had
part
of
his
face
covered.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
realize,
justice
alito,
that
even
with
regard
to
that
statement,
while
it
is
true
that
boatner
provided
those
limiting
details,
he
also
made
statements
suggesting
that
he
was
not
confident
of
his
ability
to
actually
make
an
identification.
and
in
that
statement,
which
is
found
at
page
296
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
says:
"i
was
too
scared
to
look
at
anybody.
"
"i
wish
i
could
give
y'all
a
description.
"
so
in
some
sense
we
think
that
the
focus
on
the
gold
teeth
and
the
low-cut
haircut
in
this
case
is
a
bit
of
an
aside,
because
the
question
here
is
not
whether
he
saw
enough
to
support
the
subsequent
identification.
the
question
is
whether
his
suppressed
statements
in
which
he
repeatedly
said,
i
can't
make
an
identification,
contradict
his
in-court
confident
identification
of
petitioner.
and
we
think
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
all
that
the
court
essentially
need
say
in
an
opinion
is
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
in
which
all
you
have
is
the
identification
of
a
single
eyewitness,
where
you
have
statements
in
which
that
eyewitness
said,
i
can't
make
an
identification,
and
those
statements
have
concededly
been
suppressed,
the
brady
materiality
threshold
is
satisfied.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
first
of
all,
none
of
those
statements
were
given
to
the
defense.
the
only
relevant--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yes.
none
of
the
statements
or
the
surrounding
materials
was
given
to
the
defense
at
all.
the
only
even
remotely
relevant
thing
that
was
given
to
the
defense
was
the
initial
police
report,
which
was
a
five-page
document
prepared
by
the
officers
who
initially
responded
to
the
scene,
with
a
one-page
narrative
of
what
took
place.
and
that
document,
for
the
court's
reference,
is
in
volume
10
of
the
initial
record
that
was
received
from
the
district
court
at
pages
r1907
to
1911.
now,
with
regard
to
these
specific
statements,
both
the
narrative
statements
and
the
handwritten
notes,
the
narrative
statements
were
contained
in
a
relatively
voluminous
document,
i
believe
it
was
an
83-page
document,
that
was
a
narrative
prepared
by
officer
ronquillo
that
set
out
everything
that
took
place
over
the
course
of
the
investigation.
and
none
of
that
was
disclosed.
respondent
makes
the
argument
that
the
trial
court
reviewed
that
document
in
camera,
but
we
think
that
it
is
somewhat
unclear
what,
if
anything,
the
trial
court
actually
reviewed
in
camera.
there
is
no
dispute
that
that
document
was
not
handed
over
to
the
defense.
with
regard
to
the
handwritten
notes,
there
actually
are
a
relatively
small
number
of
relevant
handwritten
notes
in
this
case,
but
all
of
them
were
contained
in
the
police
files
and
none
of
them,
none
of
the
ones
at
issue
on
which
we
are
relying,
was
handed
over
before
trial.
so
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
selective
materials
were
handed
over.
none
of
this
material
was
handed
over,
and
that's
why
we
really
think
that
this
is
a
case
that
involves
the
categorical
withholding
of
documents
and
not
simply
the
withholding
of
selected
documents
that
may
subsequently
turn
out
to
be
relevant.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
no.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
a
request
is
unnecessary
to
trigger
the
brady
obligation,
and
this
court
has
made
clear
in
cases
dating
back
to
brady
itself
that
the
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
the
prosecutor
is
irrelevant.
and,
of
course,
the
prosecutor
has
a
duty
under
brady
to
hand
over
not
only
materials
in
the
prosecutor's
own
possession,
but
also
materials
in
the
possession
of
the
police
as
well.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
there
were
five
other
suspects
who
had
gold
teeth
or
--
and
low-cut
hair
cuts.
three
of
the
other
individuals
who
were
primarily
in
the
frame
for
this
murder
had
those
characteristics.
i
believe
that
the
three
were
banister,
phillips
and
young.
the
only
other
suspect
who
is
a
reasonably
likely
suspect
who
didn't
was
robert
trackling,
the
suspect
whose
confession
to
involvement
in
these
shootings
was
withheld.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
they
were
not
uncommon
in
the
1990s.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
have
to
admit
that
my
familiarity
with
this
practice
is
perhaps
not
that
much
greater
than
yours,
justice
scalia.
but
my
understanding
is--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--my
understanding
is
that
these
are
gold
teeth
that
are
worn
either
as
temporary
or
perhaps
semi-permanent
implants,
and
that
in
hip-hop
culture
in
the
1990s
this
was
relatively
common.
but
whatever
the
provenance
of
this
practice,
it
is
undisputed
on
this
record
that
multiple
other
suspects
had
those
characteristics.
justice
sotomayor,
there
was
one
thing
you
asked
that
i
just
want
to
get
back
to
with
regard
to
the
remaining
categories
of
evidence.
i
just
want
to
set
them
out
and
then
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
the
court
has
about
them.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
there
are
three
other
categories
of
evidence
at
issue
here.
there
was
the
statement
of
phillip
young,
petitioner's
co-defendant,
suggesting
that
petitioner
was
not
involved
in
the
shootings.
there
were
also
the
statements
that
would
have
called
into
question
the
prosecution's
theory
that
petitioner
was
one
of
the
shooters,
a
theory
that
was
essential
to
establishing
the
intent
required
for
first
degree
murder
under
louisiana
law.
louisiana
is
somewhat
different
from
other
states
in
that
it
doesn't
require
a
premeditation,
but
that
it
--
but
it
does
require
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
inflict
great
bodily
harm.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
don't
think
that
that's
a
meaningless
distinction,
and
we
cite
numerous
sources
in
our
brief
that
draw
precisely
that
distinction.
but
i
think
that
what's
noteworthy
with
regard
to
the
statements
at
issue
is
that
both
boatner,
who
identified
the
weapon
that
the
perpetrator
whom
he
believed
to
be
the
petitioner
was
carrying,
and
the
state's
ballistics
expert,
kenneth
leary,
who
identified
the
weapon
that
was
responsible
for
the
firing
of
the
casings
at
issue,
conspicuously
failed
to
say
that
the
weapon
at
issue
was
a
9-millimeter
handgun.
but
at
trial
their
testimonies
suddenly
converged
and
boatner,
who
had
previously
said
only
that
the
perpetrator
was
carrying
a
handgun,
said
that
the
perpetrator
was
carrying
a
9-millimeter
handgun;
and
leary,
who
said
that
the
casings
at
issue
had
come
from
a
machine
pistol
of
the
intratec
or
mac-11
type,
suddenly
said
that
they
came
from
a
9-millimeter
handgun
instead.
and
so
at
a
minimum,
if
the
defense
had
possessed
those
statements,
it
could
have
sown
doubt
on
whether
the
firearm
was
in
fact
one
and
the
same
and,
therefore,
sown
doubt
on
a
critical
element
of
the
offense
at
issue.
and
finally,
the
only
other
category--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that's
right
with
regard
to
leary's
testimony.
i
think
the
thing
that
was
a
little
bit
odd
with
regard
to
boatner's
testimony
was
the
sudden
degree
of
specificity.
having
said
only
that
it
was
a
handgun
or
a
chrome
automatic
in
his
prior
statements,
he
said
at
trial
that
it
was
a
9-millimeter
handgun,
which
he
had
not
previously
said
in
the
statements
that
were
withheld.
and,
finally,
the
last
category
of
evidence
consists
of
the
notes
of
the
interview
in
which
eric
rogers
relayed
robert
trackling's
confession
to
involvement
in
the
shootings.
as
the
amicus
brief
of
the
nacdl
points
out,
courts
have
routinely
held
that
confessions
by
other
perpetrators
constitute
exculpatory
evidence,
even
with
regard
to
offenses
that
may
have
had
multiple
perpetrators.
and
we
certainly
believe
that
at
a
minimum
the
suppression
of
those
notes,
when
considered
in
conjunction
with
all
the
other
evidence,
comfortably
satisfies
the
brady
materiality
standard,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
think
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
we
believe
that
all
of
this
evidence
was
before
the
state
post-conviction
court.
thank
you,
and
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
three
very
quick
points.
first
of
all
with
regard
to
larry
boatner's
statements
on
march
the
6th,
justice
breyer,
you'll
be
happy
to
note
that
your
law
clerk's
notes
were
correct.
boatner
on
march
the
6th
said,
and
this
is
at
page
308
of
the
joint
appendix,
could
not
id
anyone
because
couldn't
see
faces;
can't
tell
if
had
faces
covered;
didn't
see
anyone;
would
not
know
them
if
i
saw
them.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
statement
applies
to
all
of
the
perpetrators.
the
state
advances
the
argument
today,
as
it
did
in
its
brief,
that
boatner
must
have
been
too
scared
to
cooperate
by
march
the
6th,
but
that
is
utterly
belied
by
the
record
in
this
case.
boatner
continued
to
cooperate
with
the
police
investigation
in
the
following
weeks
reviewing
police
line-ups.
he
even
testified
that
he
wanted
to
go
looking
for
petitioner
after
seeing
his
photograph
in
the
new
orleans
newspaper,
pages
489
and
494
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
didn't
leave
new
orleans
until
june,
3
months
later,
and
he
actually
returned
to
new
orleans
before
petitioner
was
even
apprehended,
so
again--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
alito,
it
is
entirely
unclear
based
on
this
record.
counsel
for
respondent
cites
the
transcript
from
october
31st,
1995,
a
transcript
that
wasn't
even
prepared
until
after
cert
was
granted
in
this
case.
it's
clear
that
the
court
reviewed
something,
but
it
is
entirely
unclear
from
that
transcript
what
the
court
reviewed;
and
of
course,
even
if
the
court
had
made
an
in
camera
determination
it
would
no
way
--
in
no
way
affect
our
claim
after
the
fact
here.
my
second
point:
the
state
today
for
the
first
time
says
in
response
to
the
question
from
justice
scalia
that
there
was
more
evidence
here
linking
petitioner
to
the
crime
and
relies
on
the
testimony
of
eddie
young,
the
brother
of
phillip
young,
the
individual
who
was
found
at
the
scene.
but
the
sole
substance
of
that
testimony
was
that
phillip
young
knew
petitioner,
and
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
scarcely
inculpatory,
and
if
it
was,
anyone
in
new
orleans
who
knows
a
felon
ought
to
be
worried;
and
therefore
we
really
don't
think
that
that
adds
anything
to
the
evidence
in
this
case.
the
sole
evidence
linking
petitioner
to
the
crime
was
the
statement
--
the
testimony
of
larry
boatner.
third,
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
the
language
in
this
court's
cases
in
kyles
and
agurs
suggesting
that
prosecutors
should
err
on
the
side
of
caution.
that
is
part
of
the
constitutional
standard
because
after
all,
the
materiality
requirement
is
part
of
the
requirement
for
a
constitutional
violation
under
brady.
but
all
of
the
evidence
at
issue
here
including
boatner's
statements
was
withheld
from
the
defense,
leaving
aside
this
question
of
what
the
trial
court
may
have
reviewed
in
camera.
and
the
prosecutor's
conduct
in
this
case,
with
all
due
respect
to
ms.
andrieu,
was
not,
quote,
"a
little
too
close
to
the
wind.
"
the
orleans
parish
district
attorney's
office
acted
with
flagrant
disregard
for
its
obligations
under
brady
in
this
case.
the
brady
standard
has
been
around
for
half
a
century.
there
is
no
real
ambiguity
about
what
that
standard
requires,
and
we
think
that
the
conduct
in
this
case
was
in
fact
egregious
and
clearly
violated
that
standard.
we
think
that
the
trial
court
erred
by
rejecting
petitioner's
brady
claim
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
its
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
