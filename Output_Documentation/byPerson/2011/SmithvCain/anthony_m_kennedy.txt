the
standard
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
would
have
been
different,
reasonable
probability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
looking
at
the
appendix,
there
are
some
asterisks.
were
these
statements,
the
first
two
--
the
one
at
252
in
the
joint
appendix
and
then
the
statement
on
march
2nd,
which
is
the
one
you
just
referred
to,
296,
were
parts
of
those
statements
given
to
the
defense
counsel
or
none
of
the
statements?
and
how
long
were
the
documents?
were
they
20
or
30
pages?
can
you
tell
me
a
little
bit
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
shouldn't
have
said
statements.
none
of
the
reports.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
just
tell
me,
how
does
brady
work?
is
there
some
obligation
for
the
defense
counsel
to
say:
please
give
me
all
relevant
reports?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
on
the
materiality
point,
i
--
i
just
have
to
agree
with
justice
ginsburg.
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
when
the
defense
stands
up
and
said,
and
isn't
it
true
that
in
this
statement
which
you've
just
testified
to
on
direct
and
which
the
police
have
put
in
on
direct,
you
also
said
you
could
not
identify
any
perpetrators
of
the
murder
--
and
then
the
prosecutor
says
immaterial
and
the
judge
says
strike
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
can't
believe
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
boatner
statement
of
3/6/95,
in
which
boatner
told
police
he
could
not
identify
any
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
murder.
ja-259/60.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
that's
immaterial.
i
find
that
just
incredible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
concede
there
was
a
brady
violation
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
now
concede--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
was
a
brady
violation
in
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
telling
the
court
that
this
should
have
been
kept
from
the
defense,
all
of
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
brady.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
was
not
--
because
it
was
not
turned
over.
and
with
all
respect,
i
think
you
misspoke
when
you
--
when
you
were
asked
what
is
--
what
is
the
test
for
when
brady
material
must
be
turned
over.
and
you
said
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
--
reasonable
likelihood;
pardon
me
--
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
would
have
been
different.
that's
the
test
for
when
there
has
been
a
brady
violation.
you
don't
determine
your
brady
obligation
by
the
test
of
a
brady
violation.
you're
transposing
two
very
different
things.
and
so
that's
incorrect.
