what
were
these--
[laughter]
they
are
uncommon
to
me.
these
--
these
were
not
gold
teeth
that
were
implanted,
right?
was
it
some
kind
of
a
mouthpiece
of
gold?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry
to
hear
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
only
the
only
eyewitness
but
if
i
understand
it
correctly
the
only
evidence
against
the
defendant.
this
was
the
only
evidence
against
him,
this
one
eyewitness
identification,
right?
was
there
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
say
"all
of
them".
all
of
them?
didn't
apply
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
was
not
--
that
applied
to
everyone,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
one
at
the
scene
applied
to
everyone.
justice
antonin
scalia
"can't
identify
anyone".
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you're
bringing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
--
may
i
suggest
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
--
you
stop
fighting
as
to
whether
it
should
be
turned
over?
of
course
it
should
have
been
turned
over.
i
think
the
case
you're
making
is
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
that's
a
closer
case,
perhaps,
but
surely
it
should
have
been
turned
over.
why
don't
you
give
that
up?
