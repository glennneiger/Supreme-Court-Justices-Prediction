ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
survivor
who
could
identify
the
assailant
who
led
the
massacre
in
the
small
home
at
2230
north
roman
street
was
larry
boatner.
he
identified
larry
--
he
identified
the
petitioner
after
having
searched
the
faces
of
72
individuals
who
were
presented
to
him
in
photo
line-ups,
one
after
the
other.
and
yes,
justice
sotomayor,
several
of
the
--
of
those
faces
or
several
of
those
individuals
bore
short
fade
haircuts.
and
yes,
some
of
the
individuals
who
were
pictured
in
those
photo
line-ups
were
other
suspects.
the
record
reflects
that
mr.
boatner
scrutinized
those
72
faces.
at
one
point
line-up
11
was
shown
to
him
on
march
22nd
and
he
remarked
about
the
haircut.
he
said:
my
assailant
wore
his
hair
like
this--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--no,
it
was
not.
i
believe
the
--
mr.
smith's
photograph
was
pictured
in
the
times-picayune
newspaper
on
june
7th
and
this
particular
line-up
was
shown
to
mr.
boatner
on
march
22nd.
so
at
that
point,
line-up
eight,
he
stopped
and
remarked
about
the
hair.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes,
he
did.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
his
reason,
your
honor,
is
--
it's
contained
most
specifically
on
page
191
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
is
frankly
that
he
was
afraid.
he
obvious
--
and
i
think
the
jury
would
have
understood
that.
he
obviously
knew
what
mr.
smith
was
capable
of.
he
--
i'm
sure
he
feared--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--well,
i
don't
know
that
he
changed
his
mind,
but
he
was
presented
with
a
line-up
and
when
he
was
presented
with
a
line-up
he
very
quickly
identified
juan
smith
and
said:
that
is
him;
i
will
never
forget
his
face.
so--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--that
was
after.
and
all
of
this,
by
the
way,
was
vetted
during
--
during
a
motion
to
suppress
hearing.
when
the
trial
judge
learned
--
that
the
photograph
had
been
shown
in
the
newspaper,
he
reopened
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
to
determine
--
and
over
the
state's
objection;
we
argued
that
this
was
not
state
action
--
but
he
reopened
the
motion
to
suppress
to
determine
for
himself
whether
or
not
that
newspaper
had
in
any
way
tainted
the
later
identification
of
juan
smith.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
and
i
can
appreciate
your
concern.
this
court
has
held
that
favorable
evidence
--
this
court
has
held
that
favorable
evidence
which
is
not
material
need
not
be
turned
over
to
the
defense.
and
if
i
could--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
put
them
in
perspective.
mr.
boatner
provided
two
statements
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
boatner
provided
a
statement
on
the
scene,
two
statements
the
day
of
the
incident.
to
a
first
responding
officer
who
was
not
detective
ronquillo,
he
gave
a
description
and
that
description
was:
heavy
built,
with
a
hair
with
a
fade,
with
a
little
small
top,
with
a
lot
of
gold
in
his
mouth.
that
was
while
he
was
at
the
scene.
later,
homicide
detective
john
ronquillo
arrived
at
the
scene
and
apparently,
according
to
his
notes,
and,
most
importantly,
according
to
his
post-conviction,
testimony,
he
asked
larry
--
he
asked
larry
boatner
for
a
description,
and
larry
boatner
said:
i
can't
give
you
a
description.
i'll
put
them
all
in
perspective
and
then
go
back
to
what
detective
ronquillo
and
mr.
boatner
had
to
say
about
that.
but
in
any
case,
mr.
boatner's
severe
laceration
was
treated
and
then
he
was
escorted
to
the
homicide
office,
where
he
gave
his
formal
statement.
and
in
that
statement
--
statement,
part
of
which
has
been
reproduced
here
by
opposing
counsel,
mr.
boatner
said:
i
can
tell
you
about
the
one,
the
one
who
put
the
pistol
in
my
face.
he
was
a
black
male
with
a
low
cut,
gold
in
his
mouth.
i
don't
know
how
many;
that's
all;
i
was
too
scared
to
look
at
anybody.
all
of
them
had
guns,
one
was
an
ak;
one
was
a
tec-9;
the
one
who
hit
me
had
a
chrome
automatic.
it
was
big.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
you
would
like
to
have
it,
but
it's
not
material
because
sandwiched
between
two
descriptions
--
and
he
is
--
between
two
descriptions,
he
says:
i
can't
identify.
and
taken
in--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--there
was
--
the
identification
of
juan
smith
was
bolstered
by
evidence,
by
testimony
of
the
brother
of
phillip
young,
the
perpetrator
who
was
left
at
the
scene
as
an
aphasic
amnesiac.
so
he
established
a
link
that
the
two
are
known
to
each
other,
juan
smith
and
--
but
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
but
that's
not--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--but
that's
not
what
he
says.
he
says
i
can
tell
you
about
the
one,
the
one
who
put
the
pistol
in
my
face.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
that
is
what
i
mean,
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
well,
i--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--the
most
important
evidence
in
this
case
is
the
testimony,
or
the
transcript
from
post-conviction
--
the
post-conviction
relief
hearing.
john
ronquillo,
whose
notes
these
are,
was
asked
about
the
march
6
statement,
and
i
guess
we
are
fast-forwarding.
the
next
--
the
statement
after
the
statement
made
--
the
one
made
in
the
homicide
office
was
made
on
march
6.
so
at
that
time,
detective
ronquillo
called
larry
boatner,
and
larry
boatner
said
"i
can't
identify
anyone".
and
based
--
and
what
detective
ronquillo
had
to
say
about
that
--
first
of
all,
larry
boatner
didn't
remember
saying
that.
but
what
detective
ronquillo
had
to
say
about
it
--
and
he
was
the
person
who
was,
whose
impressions
--
about
whose
impressions
we
are
speaking
--
was
that
at
that
point,
mr.
boatner,
like
many
murder
witnesses,
was
retreating.
temporarily
equivocating,
as
we
wrote
in
brief
--
he
was
retreating
somewhat
from
his
assistance
with
the
police
--
police.
not
in
--
not
in
an
abnormal--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--your
honor,
can
i--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--they
would,
your
honor.
and--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--first
of
all,
there
were
not
four
statements
that
were
made
where
boatner
said
he
couldn't
identify
anyone
--
again.
he
gave
two
statements
the
day
of
where
he
described,
and
one
statement--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
i'm
sorry.
those
were
statements
where
he
inculcated
the
defendant.
there
were
two
statements
--
starting
on
the
scene,
there
is
a
statement
provided
to
the
first
responding
officer
where
he
provides
a
description.
larry
boatner
provides
a
description--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--yes.
and
--
and
those
other
suspects'
photographs
were
all
contained
--
were
contained
in
photo
ids,
photo
lineups,
and
mr.
boatner
never
selected
one
of
them.
the
other
thing
is
he
--
gold
teeth.
he
knew
that
his
perpetrator
had
gold
teeth.
the
next
time
he
saw
mr.
smith
was
at
trial
in
court.
mr.
smith
revealed
his
teeth,
and
he
had
gold
teeth.
but
as
far
as
the
other
suspects
having
the
haircut
or
physical
--
similar
physical
attributes--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--and
this
court
has
said
that
brady
is
a
reflective
--
is
a
reflective
analysis.
he
did
not--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--absolutely.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
under
louisiana
law,
prior
--
statements
of
witnesses
are
not
discoverable.
but
of
course,
under
this
court's
decision
in
brady
v.
maryland,
if
the
prosecutor
makes
a
determination
that
they
would
materially
affect
the
outcome
of--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--no.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
no.
and
these
statements
were
provided
in
camera.
defense
filed
a
motion
for
discovery,
and
he
asked
for
brady
material.
he
asked
specifically
for
the
supplemental
report,
which
is
where
these
statements
are
contained.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
not
at
all.
the
brady
obligation
is
ours.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
that's
actually
a
poor
practice.
but
in--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--the
prosecutor
in
this
case
actually
turned
them
over
to
the
trial
court
for
an
in
camera
inspection.
and
articles
--
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure
article
718
actually
provides
for
that
practice--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--no,
what
he--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--i'm
sorry.
when
he's
saying
that
he
could
not
see
the
faces,
he
is
not
referring
to
juan
smith.
he
and
--
detective
ronquillo
testified
at
post-conviction
that
he
always
said
he
could
identify
the
one,
the
one
whose
face
appeared
a
handgun's
length
from
his
own,
unmasked,
when
he
opened
that
front
door
at
2230
north
roman.
detective
ronquillo
put
this
in
perspective
at
post-conviction.
and
as
i
said--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--juan.
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
there
was
--
the
judge
did
not
give
express
findings
of
fact
or
finding
of
law,
but--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--yes.
the
one
at
the
scene
when
he
says
"i
can't
describe
anyone"
here.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
i'm
sorry?
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
to
everyone.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
march
6
applied
to
everyone
--
everyone
except
juan
smith.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
oh,
i'm
sorry.
no.
he's--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--i'm
sorry.
in
both
circumstances,
he
is
saying
--
the
first
time
he
is
saying
i
can't
describe.
the
second
time
he
is
saying
i
can't
help
you;
i
can't
identify
everyone.
but
the
jury
was--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--anyone.
and
really,
what
it--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--it
was
turned
over
to
the
judge
under
article
718
for
in-camera
inspection.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
that's
on
october
31st
of
1995.
there
is
a
hearing.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
mr.
smith--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
the
transcript
of
october
31st,
1995.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
not
at
all.
we
believe
it's
a
bad
practice.
but
it
is--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--did
we
concede?
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
no.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
no.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
under
this--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--court's
decision
in
kyles,
i
believe
a
prudent
prosecutor
would
have
disclosed
it.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
no.
but--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
no,
there
is
not.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
with
regard
to
the
march
6
statement
where
larry
boatner
tells
john
ronquillo
at
that
point:
i
can't
tell
anyone,
what
mr.
--
detective
ronquillo
had
to
say
about
that
is
dispositive.
and
he
said:
at
that
point
larry
boatner
was
withdrawing
from
--
he
was
afraid
--
he
was
withdrawing
from
police
assistance.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
the
post
--
the
post-conviction
testimony
is
pivotal
because
there
is
a
petition
that's
filed
with
attachments,
with
exhibits.
that
is
what
gets,
and
that
is
what
got
mr.
smith
his
day
in
court,
his
four-day
postconviction
hearing
testimony
--
post
convictionhearing.
larry
boatner
took
the
stand.
what
larry
boatner
had
to
say
and
what
john
ronquillo
had
to
say
--
because
after
all,
these
are
john
ronquillo's
notes,
i
think
they
are
important.
and
i
think
they're
important
in
a
brady
analysis
because
when
you
go
through--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--there
is
not.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
no.
i
believe
that
a
prudent
prosecutor
would
have.
i
believe
we
are
tacking
a
little
bit
too
close
to
the
wind,
but
a
prudent
prosecutor
would
have.
i
also
think
that--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--because--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--if
mr.
boatner
could
not
identify
anyone,
mr.
boatner
would
not
have
viewed
15
lineups.
when
the
lineups
were
presented
to
him--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--because
if
they
had
been
presented
--
if
those
statements
had
been
presented
to
defense
--
presented
to
a
jury,
the
out
--
the
outcome
would
have
remained
the
same.
the
jury--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--yes.
you
are
speaking
of
the
other
pieces
of
evidence?
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
yes.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
if
the
charity
hospital's
medical
records
of
mr.
boatner
are
still
being
urged
to
this
court--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--shaelita
russell.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
well,
to
be
clear,
ms.
russell
never
made
a
dying
declaration.
what
the
defense
is
presenting
to
this
court
as
evidence
of
a
dying
declaration
are
words
and
dashes
of
detective
ronquillo,
written
at
some
point
where
he--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--the
judge
again
did
not
make
specific
facts
of
finding
or
loss.
the
judge
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
and
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg,
your
--
shaelita
russell
did
not
give
a
dying
declaration.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
and
that
information
--
dale
mims
testified
at
post-conviction.
he
testified
he
did
not
see
the
assailants
arrive.
he
did
not
see
them--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--and
it's
plausible
that
mr.
boatner
--
i'm
sorry
--
that
mr.
smith
masked
himself
upon
escape
after--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--yes.
so
worried
that
the
car
that
they
arrived
in
had
no
license
plate.
they
were
definitely
looking
not
to
be
identified.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
i'm
sorry?
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
your
honor,
we
believe
that
we
have
an
--
an
argument
that
these
statements
of
larry
boatner
are
not
material.
the
other
evidence
that
mr.
shanmugam
has
put
before
this
court
were
either
not
suppressed
or
not
favorable.
the
statement
--
larry
boatner
gave
several
--
he
did
describe
juan
smith.
he
described
him
on
several
occasions,
and
he
ultimately
identified
him,
and
he
identified
him
after
scrupulously
viewing
15
--
13
lineups.
so
the
suggestion
that
he
said
at
one
point,
because
he
is
equivocating,
because
his
name
is
on
--
his
name,
address,
contact
information
are
on
the
police
report.
it
is
not
a
surprise
--
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
surprise
to
orleans
parish
jurors
--
to
find
that
early
in
an
investigation,
a
murder
witness
equivocates,
which
is
something--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--and
in
this
case--
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
--yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
made
a
difference.
yes.
ms.
donna
r.
andrieu
well,
i
--
and
i
actually
thought
i
had
when
i
said
a
prudent
prosecutor
would,
but
in
making
a
sort
of
over-the-shoulder,
rear
window
brady
analysis,
i
don't
think
that
these
statements
--
that
the
statements
made
to
--
