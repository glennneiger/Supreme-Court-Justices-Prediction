wasn't
there
a
picture?
boatner
saw
a
picture
in
the
newspaper
and
that
turned
on
the
light
for
him;
right?
it
wasn't
any
police
suggestion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
--
wasn't
there
an
intervening
--
didn't
he
say
5
days
after
that
he
couldn't
identify?
and
that
was
after
what
he
said
on
the
night,
the
same
night.
5
days
later
he
said:
i
couldn't
--
i
couldn't
identify
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
this
--
was
this
line-up,
was
this
after
boatner
saw
the
photograph
in
the
newspapers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
before
or
after
the
picture
in
the
paper?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
it
not
be
material?
here
is
the
only
eyewitness--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
we
have
inconsistent
statements.
are
you
really
urging
that
the
prior
statements
were
immaterial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
that
make
it
not
material?
you
can
argue
that
it
should
be
given
diminished
weight,
but
an
inconsistent
statement
by
the
only
eyewitness
seems
to
me
most
material
and
useful
to
the
defense
in
cross-examining
the
eyewitness.
i
really
don't
understand
how
you
can
--
you
can
argue
that
the
jury
shouldn't
put
much
weight
on
it,
because
there
were
these
other
things;
but
to
say
that
it's
immaterial
--
i
find
that
that
is
--
is
not
plausible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
a
description
that
other
--
other
suspects
fit.
the
close-cut
hair,
the
gold
teeth.
that
didn't
identify
smith,
as
opposed
to
the
other
folks
who
had
those
same
characteristics.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
--
in
terms
of
prior
inconsistent
statements,
and
we
can
argue
about
whether
there
were
more
consistent
statements
than
inconsistent
statements
--
to
say
that
this
was
not
brady
material,
because
what
--
we
are
not
saying
that
larry
boatner
made
up
a
story
on
the
stand
that
doesn't
--
didn't
conform
to
the
truth.
the
question
is
should
the
prosecutor,
should
the
defense
attorney,
have
access
to
a
prior
inconsistent
statement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
kyles
is
a
decision
saying
what
the
prosecutor
must
disclose,
not:
it's
a
good
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
know?
how
can
you
possibly
know?
the
jury
is
supposed
to
decide
on
the
credibility
of
this
witness.
there
is
a
statement
that
he
made
it
--
a
prior
inconsistent
statement.
the
--
mr.
shanmugam
outlined
five
categories
of
what
he
called
brady
materials.
is
--
are
you
maintaining
that
none
of
those
categories,
that
there
was
no
brady
material
at
all
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
mims
and
--
what
was
the
woman's
name?
russell?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
young
and
the
snitch,
the
one
who
said
that
--
his
cellmate
told
him
--
his
cellmate
was
the
perpetrator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
a
determination
by
the
judge
that
it
wasn't
a
dying
declaration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
let's
go
to
mims,
who
says,
"i
saw
them"
--
"i
saw
the
perpetrators
go
to
their
car
when
they
were
exiting.
"
"they
had
ski
masks.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
most
unlikely
as
your
--
as
what
mr.
shanmugam
said,
that
robbers
--
i
mean,
the
people
who
are
entering,
intruding
on
another's
premises
to
rob
or
whatever
else
they
wanted
to
do,
would
wear
masks
going
out
but
not
going
in?
i
mean,
they
don't
want
anybody
--
they
don't
want
anybody
to
be
able
to
identify
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
that
maybe--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you're
taking
that
judgment
away
from
the
jury.
there
was
a
prior
inconsistent
statement.
shouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
it?
a
--
a
prior
inconsistent
statement,
one
that
is
favorable
to
the
defense,
has
to
be
turned
over,
period.
that's
what
i
thought
was
--
what
brady
requires.
