justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
this?
i
mean,
i
thought
--
i
may
--
i
thought
the
issue
is
that
there
were
some
notes,
and
the
first
note,
which
was
made
on
the
day,
the
policeman
says
that
boatner
said
he
could
not
supply
a
description
of
the
perpetrator,
other
than
to
say
they
were
black
males.
then
he
said
they
had
golden
teeth
and
low-cut
haircuts.
and
5
days
later
he
could
not
id
anyone
because
he
couldn't
see
faces.
then
he
said
he'd
only
glanced
at
the
first
man.
he
couldn't
tell
if
they
had
their
faces
covered
and
didn't
see
anyone.
then
he
said:
i
could
not
id,
would
not
know
them
if
i
saw
them.
then
another
set
of
police
notes
says
he
said
that
he
could
not
identify
any
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
murder.
so
i
guess
those
are
all
notes
that
the
--
the
prosecution
did
not
give
to
the
defense.
so
if
you
were
a
defense
lawyer,
whatever
this
other
stuff
is,
i
guess
you
would
have
been
pretty
happy
to
have
those
notes,
because
you
might
have
tried
to
impeach
his
identification.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
--
you're
saying
that
i
guess
it
would
have
made
no
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i'd
like
to
hear
that,
because
it
seems
on
its
face
that
it
certainly
could
have
made
a
difference,
that
if
he
had
those
notes
that
he
could
have
tried
to
impeach
him
and
said
where
did
this
sudden
recognition
come
from.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
that
you
mean
immaterial,
or
is
it
that
you
mean
that,
that
it
wasn't
prejudicial,
because
there's
so
much
other
evidence,
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
it
would
have
made
a
difference
in
the
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we
can
forget
the
word
"material".
now,
you're
saying
there's
so
much
other
evidence
here
against
him
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference.
i
can
understand
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
it's
right.
that
is
--
that
is
--
now
i
think
i
can
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
put
it
in
those
terms
and
say
why
wouldn't
--
this
could
have
made
a
difference.
i
mean,
here,
we
have
this
witness
who
said
all
of
these
great
things
for
your
side,
and
within
a
space
of
hours,
he
has
been
telling
the
police
that
he
can't
identify
anybody,
he
doesn't
know.
i
mean,
what
--
that
sounds
like
there
is
a
probability
that
would
have
made
a
difference.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
so
odd
that
--
i
mean
look,
it
seems
like
here
it
is,
5
days
after
the
shooting
and
well
before,
i
guess,
that
this
witness
saw
any
mugshots
or
did
anything.
and
he
says
i
could
not
identify
anyone
because
he
couldn't
see
the
faces
of
the
people.
and
now
you're
saying
later,
which
you
introduce
into
trial,
his
having
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
people
and
identifying
them
from
their
faces
--
now
previously,
he
said
he
couldn't
see
their
faces.
and
in
louisiana,
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
prosecution
and
the
judges
say
that
isn't
--
you
don't
have
to
turn
over
that
statement
that
he
couldn't
see
the
faces
made
earlier.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
all
these
--
all
these
statements
that
we
have
here,
you're
saying,
all
referred
to
people
other
than
the
defendant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
was
there
a
finding
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perhaps
the
defense
would
have
liked
to
say
they
did
apply
to
the
defendant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
like--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
says,
"i
can't
identify
anyone
because
i
couldn't
see
faces.
"
okay?
that's
what
it
says
here,
at
least
in
my
notes
that
my
law
clerks
gathered.
[laughter]
all
right,
and
my
point
is,
then
this
seems
very
odd,
i
mean
really
unusual
that
in
the
state
of
louisiana
that
they
have
some
kind
of
system
that
doesn't
turn
that
statement
over
to
the
defense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
surprised
they
are
correct.
[laughter]
