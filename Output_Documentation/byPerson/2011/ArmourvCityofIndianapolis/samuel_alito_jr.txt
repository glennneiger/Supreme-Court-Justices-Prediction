could
the
city
cure
the
problem
by
rescinding
the
forgiveness
for
those
who
paid
under
the
installment
plan?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
you've
put
your
finger
on
the
reason
for
this,
which
is
that
the
city
calculated
that
what
it
did
would
be
more
politically
acceptable
than
treating
the
people
who
paid
upfront
equally
on
an
economic
basis
with
the
people
who
paid
in
installment
plans.
now
if
that's
the
reason
for
this,
is
that
rational?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
does
that
mean,
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
barrett
law
business?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
really
doesn't
seem
very
complicated
to
collect
payments
that
people
have
agreed
to
pay.
and
if
they
didn't
want
to
do
it
anymore,
i
bet
they
could
have
contracted
that
out
for
a
very
modest
fee
to
any
number
of
private
entities
that
would
have
done
it
for
them.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
other
than
political
expediency
and
administrative
convenience,
i
still
don't
understand
what
rational
basis
you
claim
there
was
for
the
distinction
that
was
drawn.
now
maybe
one
of
those
is
sufficient,
but
other
than
those
two
possible
bases,
i
don't
see
another
one.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
lots
of
reasons
for
not
giving
refunds,
but
what
are
the
reasons
for
forgiving
the
debt
that
people
agreed
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
want
forgiveness,
but
you
outline
correctly
in
your
brief
the
fact
that
the
city
had
three
options.
one
of
the
options
was
to
hold
everybody
to
what
they
understood
when
they
signed
up
under
the
barrett
law.
and
i
--
i
do
not
understand
how
your
administrative
convenience
argument
fits
in
with
the
decision
to
forgive
the
debt
of
the
people
who
agreed
to
pay
on
the
installment
plan.
when
the
city
was
collecting
those
payments
was
that
a
net
loss,
were
the
administrative
costs
of
making
those
collections
more
than
the
amount
of
money
that
was
brought
in?
if
not,
then
i
don't
see
how
administrative
convenience
justifies
a
rejection
of
that
option.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
rational
for
a
city
to
say
that
it
costs
us
$100,000
to
collect
this
money,
and
if
we
do
collect
it,
we
are
going
to
bring
in
$500,000,
so
we
don't
want
to
pay
the
$100,000,
so
we
are
going
to
get
rid
of
the
program?
that's
rational?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
net
--
if
the
net
cost
--
if
it's
a
net
gain,
what
is
the
rationality
of
abandoning
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
put
your
finger
on
it.
they
want
to
get
out
of
the
business.
what
they
have
done
is
shift
the
cost
of
the
sewers
from
a
--
from
a
small
group,
a
small
interest
group
that
is
able
to
presumably
exert
some
political
power
to
--
to
everybody.
they
spread
the
cost
around
to
everybody.
and
everybody
--
the
ordinary
person
who
has
to
pay
a
little
bit
more
every
month
doesn't
get
all
fired
up
about
it.
that's
what
this
--
that's
what
this
is
about,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
some
identified
or
identifiable
demographic
difference
between
the
two
groups
that
either
justifies
or
could
on
--
on
a
remand
justify
the
different
treatment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
time
is
usually
a
rational
reason
for
doing
it.
if
--
suppose
everybody
paid
on
the
installment
plan.
the
city
could
say
as
of
a
certain
date
we're
--
no
more
installment
payments.
then
the
people
who
paid
up
previously,
would
--
would
they
be
--
would
they
have
an
equal
protection
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
there
had
never
been
the
option
of
making
the
lump
sum
payment.
everybody
paid
on
installment
plans
over
a
10-year
period,
and
then
the
city
decided
january
1,
2012,
no
more
installment
plans;
everything
that
is
still
due
is
forgiven.
that
would
be
rational,
wouldn't
it?
