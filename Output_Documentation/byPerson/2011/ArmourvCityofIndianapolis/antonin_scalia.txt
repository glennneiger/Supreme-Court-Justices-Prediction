justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
you
win,
does
--
does
the
city
just
have
to
give
you
enough
to
bring
it
down
to
5
to
1
so
it's
no
longer
a
gross
disparity?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
--
i
think
that
justice
breyer
is
suggesting
that
if
you
treat
unconstitutionally
a
whole
lot
of
people,
you
can
get
away
with
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
have
any
incentive
to
bring
a
lawsuit
if
that
were
the
remedy,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
effectively--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
we
ever
decided
an
equal
protection
case
on
the
basis
that
the
--
the
state
who
had
violated
the
--
the
constitution
can't
afford
to
pay
for
it?
is
there
any
case
that
supports
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
too
expensive?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
we
have
to
deny
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
believe
in
the
administrative
nightmare
exception
to
the
equal
protection
clause?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
would
eliminate
all
litigation
on
equal
protection
clause
grounds
if
all
that
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
achieve
is
not
any
benefit
to
him
but
harming
somebody
else.
that's
--
the
classic
case
is
the
sex
discrimination
case,
where
a
state
had
a
drinking
law
which
said
that
men
could
drink
at
the
age
of
18
but
women
at
the
age
of
21.
and
what
happened
in
the
lawsuit?
did
the
court
say,
well,
i
guess
--
i
guess
men
won't
be
able
to
drink
at
18.
no,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
said
that
men
would
have
to
drink
at
18,
not
that
women
will
have
to
wait
until
21.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here
the
state
has
defined
the
class.
that's
the
difference.
i
mean,
to
say
employers
with
less
than
8
is
a
separate
class,
that's
fine.
but
--
but
here,
the
state
said,
we're
creating
this
class
of
--
of
people
who
have
to
pay
for
sewer
assessments.
and
we're
going
to
treat
them
equally.
that's
what
the
law
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
saying
that
any
future
law
which
--
which
disregards
an
equal
classification
that
a
prior
law
established
is
okay?
so
long
as
it's
a
future
law
that
does
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
will
always
be
a
future
law
that
does
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that's
what
we
are
questioning.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that
why.
i
mean,
people
paid
the
lump
sum.
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
people
come
forward
and
say
i'm
one
of
the
ones
who
paid
the
lump
sum,
i
want
a
refund;
and
if
somebody
doesn't
come
and
present
such
a
claim,
the
city
doesn't
pay.
if
someone
does--
justice
antonin
scalia
--surely
the
city
has
records.
