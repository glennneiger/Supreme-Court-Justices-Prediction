chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-161,
armour
v.
city
of
indianapolis.
mr.
stancil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
some
--
some
time
ago,
i
thought
you
were
just
about
to
tell
us
how
much
money
the
city
says
will
be
at
stake
if
you
prevail.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
--
the
city
says
that's
the
total
amount
that's
at
issue
if
you
prevail,
if
the
taxpayers
prevail
on
this
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
an
easier
thing
to
administer
than
the
system
that
was
struck
down
in
allegheny
pittsburgh?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
paid,
that's
what
your
assessment
was.
and
they
argued
well,
this
is
easy;
that's
enough.
and
this
court
said
no;
it's
an
equal
protection
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stancil.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
simply
because,
as
we
said
in
allegheny
pittsburgh,
the
basis
for
considering
the
equal
protection
claim
is
the
rights
that
you're
given
under
state
law.
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
it
says
you
have
the
right
to
be
treated
equally
with
respect
to
assessments.
and
you
weren't.
here
the
law
says
you
have
the
right
to
be
treated
equally,
or
whatever
it
is,
the
apportionment,
and
they
weren't.
all
that
you're
saying
there
is
that
state
law
gets
to
set
the
base.
and
if
the
state
law
says,
we
don't
treat
people
the
same
in
extending
sewer
hook-ups,
then
that
takes
away
your
equal
protection
clause.
but
it
just
sets
the
base.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
change
in
policy
--
the
change
in
policy
is
from
treating
people
equally
to
treating
people
unequally.
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
they
are
changing
that
policy
addresses
the
issue
at
all.
they're
going
from
a
system
where
everybody
was
subject
to
the
same
assessment
to
a
system
where
some
paid
something
and
other
people
paid
30
times
that.
yes,
it's
a
change,
but
it's
the
change
that
presents
the
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
city
retains
that
option
in
this
case
going
forward.
the
problem
with
your
reality
is
you
are
dealing
with
a
situation,
you
are
saying
well,
here's
a
violation
and
the
law
can
--
and
what
does
the
law
do?
the
truth
is
this
is
exactly
180
degrees
away.
there
is
no
violation
and
the
law
creates
the
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you
are
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
excuse
me.
i
don't
see
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
you
are
saying
this
would
be
a
rational
system
going
forward,
but
you
also
promised
the
people
that
they
would
be
treated
equally
over
a
certain
period.
when
you
start
out
it's
not
equal,
because
somebody
pays
$400
and
somebody
else
pays
10,000,
and
--
but
over
the
30-year
period,
it's
the
same.
that's
why
it's
equal
in
the
beginning,
even
though
somebody
pays
400
and
somebody
pays
10,000,
because
they
are
going
to
pay
the
same
over
the
period.
then
you
lop
off
the
period.
so
you
are
not
treating
them
equally,
when
you
started.
you
can
no
longer
say,
don't
worry
about
the
inequality,
it
will
sort
out
in
30
years.
now
you
can't
--
you
have
no
way
of
telling
them
why
it's
not
unequal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
a
provision
--
you
said
i
would
search
in
vein
for
this
provision
in
the
barrett
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
went
and
searched
and
15--
[laughter]
--15(b)(3)
says:
the
costs
shall
be
primarily
apportioned
equally
among
all
abutting
lands
or
lots.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
costs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
do
i
look
to
find
that
when
they
say
the
costs
shall
be
apportioned
equally,
they
are
not
referring
to
the
costs,
but
they
were
referring
to
the
assessments?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
costs
of
the
project
are
funded
by
the
--
the
sewer
hook-ups,
and
some
people
pay
400
and
some
people
paid
10,000.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
just
said
it's
not
popularity.
in
page
1
of
your
brief
you
say
the
barrett
law
method
eventually
proved
to
be
politically
unpopular.
sounds
like
it's
popularity
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
mentioned
heckler
v.
mathews.
in
heckler
v.
mathews,
the
court
said,
quote:
"ordinarily,
extension
of
the
withheld
benefit
rather
than
nullification
is
the
proper
course.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
while
it
is
true
that
you
can
cure
a
violation
by
levelling
up
or
levelling
down,
ordinarily,
extension
of
the
benefit
is
the
proper
course.
and
that's
for
the
reason
justice
scalia
gave,
because
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
equal
protection
case
brought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
wrong
--
what
did
the
court
mean
when
they
said
"ordinarily,
extension
is
the
proper
course?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
--
when
you
say
"the
other
case",
do
you
mean
every
other
project?
because
that's
what,
a
class
action;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
everybody
--
if
everybody
entitled
to
a
refund
came
forward,
it
would
cost
you
$2.7
million.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
3,
$3
million.
and
you
say
the
real
problem
is
the
huge
administrative
costs
in
trying
to
figure
out
who
you
owe
it
to.
if
it's
that
huge,
all
they
do
is
--
who
somebody
comes
forward,
asks
for
a
refund,
verify
that
they
are
a
--
you
know,
were
a
homeowner
on
the
project,
give
them
the
refund.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
most
it's
going
to
cost
is
$3
million.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
amnesty
--
i
don't
get
--
amnesty
is
entirely
different.
amnesty
is
for
people
who
did
something
wrong.
nobody
did
something
wrong
here;
it
wasn't
wrong
to
pay
with
installments.
so
the
amnesty
--
don't
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stancil,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-161,
armour
versus
city
of
indianapolis.
