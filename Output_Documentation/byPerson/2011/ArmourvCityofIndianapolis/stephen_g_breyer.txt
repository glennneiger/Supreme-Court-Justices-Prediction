justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
were
a
lot
more
than
20
different
lots.
20
different
--
i
mean,
what's
your
view
of
how
the
cutoff
should
work?
do
they
have
to
refund
all
the
money,
everybody
who,
in
fact,
ever
paid
a
barrett
law
assessment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
care
what
the
state
says;
i'm
saying
a
matter
as
a
constitutional
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
in
the
state,
when
they
have
let's
say,
10,000
people
who
have
already
paid
their
assessments
--
well,
why
doesn't
it
have
to
give
them
back
their
money,
on
your
theory?
that's
my
simple
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
fine.
they
define
here
who
is
similarly
situated,
and
the
people
who
aren't
are
the
ones
who
are
on
the
installment
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
do.
the
reason
is
because
they
think
it's
unfair
to
give
the
people
--
they
think
it's
unfair
--
they
don't
want
to
bother
collecting
it
from
those
people
who
haven't
paid
yet.
okay?
that's
why.
and
they
don't
see
a
way,
if
you
--
so
if
we
are
going
to
free
them,
we
don't
want
to
go
back
into
history
and
then
suddenly
give
back
all
the
people
whoever
paid
their
assessment.
i
mean,
so
we
draw
the
line
somewhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
where
are
we
drawing
it.
that's
the
state
law.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
--
my
point,
i'm
not
making
it
clear.
my
point
is
that
what
is
less
rational
about
saying,
if
you
paid,
too
bad.
we
are
having
an
amnesty
for
the
future.
what's
less
rational
about
that
than
saying
some
of
the
people
who
paid
in
full
will
get
their
money
back
and
some
will
not.
which
is
the
line
you
want
to
draw.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't
the
administrative
--
the
administrative
--
well,
maybe
that's
one.
the
administrative
problem
is,
i
thought,
the
following:
imagine
that
you
are
the
city
mayor.
all
right?
and
suppose
the
mayor
does
what
you
want.
the
mayor
says
i'll
give
all
these
people
in
their
project
back
their
money.
the
next
day
in
my
office,
there
show
up
15
people
who
say,
last
month,
we
happened
to
be
in
project
2,
and
we
paid
all
our
money.
why
don't
you
give
us
back
our
money?
you
just
gave
it
to
the
people
in
project
1.
give
it
to
us.
and
the
next
day
after
that,
there
are
14
people
from
project
3
and
from
project
4.
what
is
your
answer
to
those
angry
taxpayers
who
have
said:
we
don't
understand
why
you
refunded
the
money
from
project
1
but
not
for
us.
what's
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
might
have
missed
a
fact
which
--
which
i'd
like
to
know.
let's
call
your
project,
project
1,
all
right?
and
all
the
others
are
2
through
20.
are
there
any
people
in
projects
2
through
20
who
still
have
money
outstanding,
or
are
they
all
paid
off?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
in
various
states.
okay.
what
happened
to
the
taxpayers
who
still
owe
money
in
projects
2
through
20?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
it's
the
same.
so
now,
the
people
for
the
angry
taxpayers
in
projects
2
through
20
show
up
at
the
mayor
and
say,
mayor,
you're
not
only
--
you
only
--
you're
not
only
--
under
your
system,
you
not
only
gave
the
all-paid-up
people
back,
if
you
win,
but
you
also
forgave
the
future
people
in
2
through
20,
and
you're
not
giving
us
our
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
arguing
the
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
older
projects.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oddly
enough,
i
was
not
suggesting
that.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
goal
here
is
very
simple.
they
say
we
have
hundreds
or
dozens
or
20
different
programs
anyway,
and
once
we
start
getting
into
the
business
of
distinguishing
among
people
who
are
already
paid
up,
it's
going
to
be
a
nightmare.
and
so
the
only
clear
line
we
draw
is
between
the
people
who
are
already
paid
up
and
the
people
who
haven't
paid.
and
we
don't
want
those
people
who
haven't
paid
to
have
to
pay,
because
that's
going
to
be
another
20
years
of
administrating
$33
a
month.
okay.
that's
their
rationale.
now
that
may
not
be
perfect,
but
it
sounds
reasonable,
doesn't
it?
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
their
rationale,
or
it's
not
perfect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
impossible.
they
don't
say
it's
impossible.
say,
try
looking
through
the
u.s.
tax
code.
it
has
thousands
of
pages.
there
is
not
one
human
being
alive
who
understands
every
provision.
all
we
have
to
do
is
start
comparing
the
provision
on
page
1
with
page
3
with
page
7
and
page
9,
and
we
will
discover
irrationality
forever.
so
i
don't
--
i
mean,
you
may
have
this
fairly
simple
case
but
i
foresee,
if
you
win,
the
--
don't
ask
me
what
will
happen,
but
i
have
a
suspicion
it's
not
going
to
be
too
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
are
saying
that
the
difference
between
the
two
classes
is
that
if
you
continue
to
have
the
tax
apply
to
the
people
who
haven't
paid
it
yet,
there
is
a
large
administrative
expense.
and
if
you
--
an
expense
that
does
not
exist
in
respect
to
the
class
that
has
already
paid.
so
the
question,
i
would
have
thought
in,
our
court
is
whether
that's
a
rational
distinction.
and
i
think
contrary
to
what
was
suggested,
administrative
expenses,
of
course,
make
a
difference
where
the
equal
protection
clause
is
concerned,
because
they
differentiate
between
the
two
classes,
and
trying
to
avoid
an
administrative
expense
is
a
rational
reason,
normally,
for
making
the
distinction.
now,
i
mention
that
because
i
know
--
what
can
--
does
that
bring
to
mind
any
authority
which
would
be
helpful,
because
there
was
a
question
that
there
is
no
such
authority.
it
makes
sense
to
me,
but
is
there
some
authority
for
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
--
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
the
city
says
--
if
it
came
out
that
way
--
we
really
want
to
give
refunds.
or
cut
the
loss.
we
want
to
stop
collecting
the
money,
period.
then
to
make
it
fair
on
this
hypothesis,
the
city
would
have
to
go
back
and
refund
money.
to
whom?
and
how
many?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
heard
your
--
your
--
your
friend
try
to
--
make
a
distinction
between
this
project,
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
give
the
money,
he
said,
to
every
other
person
--
whoever
back
in
1850
or
1890
or
whenever
it
was
--
began
to
make
barrett
law
payments.
but
you
would
with
this
one.
now,
what
--
i'd
like
a
little
comment
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
because
it's
a
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
try
to
get
my
question,
which
is,
i'm
not
--
i'm
thinking
this
is
project
1.
so
certainly
on
the
hypothesis,
you
have
to
pay
back
the
people
who
already
paid
up
for
project
1.
but
in
your
brief,
you
say
there's
project
2
through
20.
and
is
there
in
your
opinion
a
basis
for
distinguishing
all
those
people
who
have
paid
up
in
those
projects,
or
would
you
have
to
give
them
their
money
back,
too?
now,
you
heard
your
friend's
statement
--
explanation
of
why
you
wouldn't
have
to
give
them
the
money
back,
and
i
want
to
get
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
people
does
that
involve,
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
argument
isn't
that
it's
expensive
to
administer
as
much
as
it
is,
there
are
1,000
people
in
all
these
projects
who
are
already
paid
up.
we
don't
have
enough
money
to
pay
them
all
back.
that's
why
we
don't
want
to
pay
them
back.
at
the
same
time,
we
don't
want
to
collect
the
money
for
30
years
from
these
other
people
who
aren't
fully
paid
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
i
guess,
is,
is
that
rational.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
case
concerns
payments
for
sewers.
before
2005,
the
city
of
indianapolis
typically
and
in
this
particular
case
paid
for
new
sewer
lines
by
assessing
the
cost
against
the
individual
property
owner
whom
the
new
lines
benefited.
some
paid
the
entire
assessment
upfront,
others
paid
in
installments.
soon
after
completing
the
project
now
before
us,
the
city
changed
its
sewer
financing
system
to
one
based
on
bonds,
a
change
that
spread
the
responsibility
to
pay
for
individual
projects
more
widely
throughout
the
city.
in
the
process,
the
city
forgave
all
those
old
system
sewer
assessment
debts
that
had
not
yet
been
paid,
including
all
the
installments
not
yet
due,
but
the
city
did
not
refund
any
money
to
those
who
would
already
paid
their
assessments.
the
petitioners
in
the
present
case
are
homeowners
who
had
paid
their
sewer
project
assessments
in
full.
they
point
out
that
the
city's
forgiveness
decision
means
that
each
of
them
will
have
paid
about
$9000
for
a
new
sewer
connection
while
identical
homeowners,
who
chose
installment
plan
payments,
would
have
paid
close
to
nothing.
this,
they
say,
is
basically
unfair
to
the
point
where
it
violates
a
federal
constitution's
promise
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
we
don't
agree
with
that
point.
in
cases
such
as
this
one,
essentially
involving
tax
classifications,
the
equal
protection
clause
grants
states
broad
leeway
to
draw
lines
that
make
distinctions.
the
line
satisfies
the
clause
as
long
as
there
is
“any
reasonably
conceivable
state
of
facts
that
could
provide
a
rational
basis
for
the
classification”.
and
there
is
such
a
reasonably
conceivable
state
of
facts
here.
the
city
has
created
a
kind
of
amnesty
program.
any
such
amnesty
program
requires
line
drawing
among
roughly
similar
groups
of
individuals.
and
the
city
says
that
the
line
it
has
drawn
in
part
reflects
administrative
considerations.
the
line
reflects
the
fact
that
after
the
financing
system
switch,
it
would
be
too
expensive
to
maintain
an
administrative
system
for
collecting
and
processing
old
debts
not
still
outstanding
while
it
cost
nothing
at
all
simply
to
keep
the
funds
already
paid,
i.e.,
not
grant
a
refund.
indeed,
to
administer
a
refund
program
would
simply
increase
administrative
cost.
the
weight
to
give
these
reasonably
conceivable
facts
is
a
matter
primarily
for
the
city
to
determine.
we,
in
this
court,
need
only
decide
whether
the
resulting
determination
is
rational
and
we
find
that
line
drawing,
based
upon
these
administrative
considerations,
is
rational
here.
basically,
for
these
reasons,
as
elaborated
in
our
opinion
and
for
others
that
we
set
forth,
we
conclude
that
the
city's
forgiveness
program
does
not
violate
the
federal
equal
protection
clause
and
we
affirm
the
similar
conclusion
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justices
scalia
and
alito.
