mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
2005,
the
city
of
--
the
city
of
indianapolis
decided
that
it
wanted
to
abandon
its
reliance
on
the
barrett
law,
a
program
that
had
proved
unpopular
for
financing
public
improvements.
in
doing,
so
they
decided
to
make
a
clean
break
and
forgive
the
outstanding
balances
that
were
due
under
the
barrett
law
program.
the
alternative
of
maintaining
those
accounts
and
maintaining
the
tax
liens
associated
with
those
accounts
for
nearly
3
decades
was
particularly
unattractive.
now
the
petitioners--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
alito,
it
--
it
might
well
be
rational.
i
mean,
sometimes
things
that
make
policy
sense
that
the
public
likes
also
make
good
government
sense;
and
in
this
context,
what
they
wanted
to
do
is
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
barrett
law
business.
that's
the
exact
words--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
--
can
i
put
it
very
concretely?
i
mean,
before
this
--
you
know,
when
they
used
to
have
the
barrett
law
and
used
it
on
an
ongoing
basis,
within
the
controller's
office,
they
had
a
barrett
law
office.
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
barrett
law
office.
how
do
you
get
rid
of
the
barrett
law
office?
you
get
of
the
obligation
to
continue
to
collect
these
payments
for
30
years;
you
get
rid
of
the
obligations
to
keep
all
these
files
together
and
see
whether
you
are
in
a
position
to
enforce
a
tax
lien.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
of
course
they
could
have
continued
to
collect.
i
think
that's
common
ground
here,
which
i
think
ultimately
shows
why
this
is
a
very
curious
equal
protection
theory,
because
if
the
city
would
have
continued
to
collect
these,
added,
you
know,
for
30
years
then
they
agree,
there
is
no
equal
protection
clause
problem
at
all.
now,
i
think
it's
justice
kagan
was
suggesting,
if
you
now
create
a
rule
that
says
when
they
do
forgive,
they
actually
have
to
provide
refunds
and
face
equal
protection
clause
violations,
then
in
the
future
nobody
is
going
to
ever
forgive.
what
they
are
going
to
do
in
the
future
is,
even
though
they
are
trying
to
move
away
from
this
policy,
even
though
they
are
trying
to
get
out
of
the
barrett
law
business,
they
are
going
to
be
stuck.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that
that's
right.
but
the
fact
that
that's
your
reaction
i
think
shows
that
this
is
not
really
an
equal
protection
claim,
and
it's
not
really
like
allegheny
pittsburgh.
because
as
your
colloquy
with
mr.
stancil
suggested,
they
would
admit
that
af
the
government
said,
as
part
of
the
barrett
law,
look,
we
reserve
the
right
to
abandon
the
barrett
law,
and
if
we
do
so,
we,
you
know,
we
may
forgive
installment
payments.
if
they
said
that,
the
equal
protection
claim
would
go
away
in
their
view.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
two
differences,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
you
know,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
real
analog
to
allegheny
pittsburgh,
because
allegheny
pittsburgh
is
a
one
time
in
time
case.
there
the
problem
was
that
statute
was
very
different.
it
was
facially
neutral.
and
it
was
being
applied
in
an
unequal
way.
nothing,
not
one
word
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
suggests
that
if
the
state
of
west
virginia
wanted
to
change
its
policy
and
adopt
proposition
13
as
the
law
of
west
virginia,
that
it
couldn't
do
so.
and
that's
the
anomaly
here.
this
equal
--
this
equal
treatment
requirement
they
get,
they
get
it
from
the
barrett
law.
that's
the
exact
law
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
--
with
respect,
i
think
it's
the
change
that
makes
this
case
different
from
allegheny
pittsburgh.
it's
the
change
that
makes
this
government
action
rational.
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
they
didn't
change
the
barrett
law
program.
they
just
stuck
by
it
and
said,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
forgive
some
people.
but
here
they
decide
they
are
going
to
--
they're
going
to
abandon
the
very
law
that
imposes,
supposedly
--
i'm
going
to
talk
about
what
state
law
really
does.
it
supposedly
imposes
this
equal
protection
requirement.
that's
the
very
law
they
want
to
move
away
from.
and
this
idea
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
you
know,
i
count
five,
justice
alito.
if
you
want
to
hear
--
i
mean,
i'll
go
through
them.
one
is
what
i
call
making
a
clean
break,
having
not
to
deal
with
the
vestiges
of
the
old
program.
you
may
call
it
political
expedience.
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
that's,
you
know,
a
good
government
concern.
the
second
is
avoiding
the
administrative
burdens
of
particularly
the
refund
process.
and
i
think
it's
worth
recognizing
that
--
you
know,
they
say
look,
well,
what
could
be
simpler;
just
cut
a
check.
but
to
whom
and
for
what
amount?
i
mean,
if
you
are
going
to
go
back
to
close
accounts,
the
first
thing
you
are
going
to
have
to
confront
is
what
do
we
do
with
the
people
that
have
sold
their
house.
well,
i
mean,
you
know,
we
have
to
figure
out
where
they
are
now.
we
have
to
figure
out,
i
mean,
do
we--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
okay.
but,
if
i
could,
they
don't
challenge
the
forgiveness.
so
the
reason
that
i'm
trying
to
explain
that
there
are
rational
bases
for
not
giving
refunds
is
because
the
challenge
that
is
really
brought
here
is
to
resolution
101
and
it's
--
it's
forgiveness
without
refunds.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
have
the
option
what,
mr.
justice
kennedy?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
certainly
have
the
option
in
the
future.
i
think
it's
a
dispute
between
the
parties
whether
they
have
the
option
as
a
part
of
the
remedy.
i
would
say,
not
to
get
ahead
of
myself,
but
to
address
the
remedy,
this
is
very
different
from
allegheny
pittsburgh.
and
it
has
to
be
that
one
option
is
to
simply
invalidate
resolution
101.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
area
of
the
law
where
you
can
have
a
statute
or
an
ordinance
that
draws
an
invalid
distinction,
and
one
remedial
option
is
not
to
invalid
--
invalidate
the
statute
or
the
ordinance.
and
that's
the
position.
their
position
is,
you
know,
if
you
would
have
put
something
in
there
that
said
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything,
you'd
be
fine.
but
having
given
forgiveness,
and
said
we
are
not
going
to
give
refunds,
you're
stuck
not
only
with
the
forgiveness
but
also
with
giving
refunds.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
because
the
expectation
here
is
at
the
time
of
resolution
101.
at
the
time
of
resolution
101,
i
think
it's
common
ground.
the
city
was
under
no
obligation
to
provide
forgiveness.
so
if
in
101,
by
providing
forgiveness
without
refunds,
they
violated
the
equal
protection
clause,
why
isn't
the
logical
remedy
for
that
to
simply
invalidate
resolution
101?
you
receive
forgiveness
and
everybody
gets
equal
treatment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
think
what
they
said--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
think
they
said
that
was
with
respect--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
the
thing
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
the
law
that
created
the
violation
is
resolution
101,
than
the
remedy
in
every
other
area
of
constitutional
law,
including
sex
discrimination,
is
clearly
that
the
state
has
the
option.
they
can
level
up
or
they
can
level
down.
the
only
case
that's
different
is
allegheny
pittsburgh
and
the
assessment
cases
it
relies
on.
but
there
is
an
important
difference.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure,
there
is,
your
honor.
i
mean,
if
you
look
to
a
number
of
places.
i
would
look
to
carmichael
v.
southern
coal
where,
you
know,
this
court
is
confronting
a
case
where
the
state
says,
you
know,
we
are
not
going
to
tax
employers
--
employers
who
are
smaller
than
8,
because,
you
now,
the
game
is
not
worth
the
candle.
and
in
a
similar
way
here,
they
say
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
barrett
law
business.
we
want
to
make
a
clean
break,
and
they
say,
you
know,
we
don't
want
to
keep
this
office
in
the
comptroller's
office.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
have
thought,
justice
scalia,
that
this
was
an
equal
protection
case,
not
a
contracts
case,
not
a
winstar
case,
not
an
estoppel
case.
if
this
was
an
equal
protection
case,
the
relevant
time
period
would
be
the
time
period
of
the
ordinance
that's
challenged,
resolution
101.
at
that
time,
there
is
a
difference
already
in
real
world
fact
between
those
who
have
paid
in
full
and
those
who
have
outstanding
balance
and
they
are
going
to
keep
the
city
in
the
barrett
law
business
for
three
decades.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it
--
it
could
be.
there
still
has
to
be
a
rational
basis
for
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
but
a
rational
basis
is
void.
you
know,
we
have
two
sets
of
accounts.
half
of
these
accounts
are
going
to
be
a
nightmare
to
maintain.
we
have
an
estimate
from
our
comptroller,
this
is
in
the
cox
litigation,
but
it's
cited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
we
have
an
estimate
from
a
comptroller
that
is
going
to
cost
$200,000
to
upgrade
and
maintain
this
system.
we
really
don't
want
to
spend
that.
now,
if
that
$200,000
associated--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
making
this
sound
like
it's
an
estoppel
case,
like
it's
a
winstar
case.
it's
not
a
broken
promise
case.
this
is
an
equal
protection
case.
and
the
reason
there
is
a
rational
difference
at
the
time
resolution
101
is,
is
because
that
point
time
has
passed
and
they
are
in
an
different
position.
but
i
also
do
want
to
make
clear
that
you
will
look
in
vain
in
the
barrett
law
for
this
stern
promise
that
no
matter
what
happens,
we
will
eventually
collect
the
same
amount
from
everybody.
what
there
is,
is
there
is
a
requirement
for
equal
assessment
in
the
first
instance
--
nobody
says
that
was
violated
--
and
then,
if
you
elected
four
installments,
there
is
a
provision
that
says
you
shall
collect.
the
irony
of
their
position
is
they
say
it's
perfectly
okay
for
the
city
to
break
that
promise.
it's
perfectly
okay
to
give
forgiveness.
they
don't
have
a
quorum
--
a
quarrel
with
forgiveness.
they
want
forgiveness.
they
just
want
to
get
some
refunds,
too,
as
a
result.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
alito,
as
i
hear
you,
you
have
switched
from
rational
basis
to,
it
has
to
be,
you
know,
a
net
--
unless
we
can
show
a
net
loss,
we
lose.
why
can't
we
make
a
rational
judgment
that
there's
a
unique
$200,000
cost
associated
with
maintaining
this
program?
we
don't
want
to
maintain
the
program.
it's
tremendously
politically
unpopular.
we
have
moved
away
from
it.
we
don't
want
to
--
i
mean,
can
you
imagine
the
city--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
is
rational,
justice
alito,
because
they
have
to
maintain
an
office
to
do
it.
that
--
you
know,
think
about
the
city,
do
you
really
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
they
want
to
get
rid
of
the
office;
they
want
to
get
out
of
the
business;
they
want
to
make
a
clean
break.
can
you
imagine
the
city
27
years
from
now
trying
to
take
somebody's
home
by
imposing
and
then
trying
to
enforce
a
tax
lien
based
on
a
program
that
they
walked
away
from
27
years
earlier?
they
would
get
laughed
at.
they
couldn't
do
that.
and
if
they
can
make
that
judgment
in
--
another
way
of
thinking
about
it
10
years
from
now.
okay?
they
collected
everything
from
the
10-year
payers.
all
they
have
got
left
are
the
20-year
payers,
the
30-year
payers.
they
say,
you
know,
this
is
ridiculous,
it's
still
--
we
are
still
taking
in
more
money
than
it
would
cost,
but
it's
ridiculous.
we
want
to
get
out
of
this
business.
we
have
told
the
people--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it's
not
what
it's
about,
the
way
you're
describing
it.
maybe
there's
a
takings
claim
for
somebody
to
bring,
but
it's
not
an
equal
protection
claim.
what
you
articulated
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
there
were
a
provision
in
the
barrett
law
that
said,
by
the
way,
if
we
ever
get
rid
of
the
barrett
law
all
bets
are
off,
we
might
not
collect--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
that's
the
--
i
--
i
--
that's
the
provision
i
already
mentioned
about
appraisals.
that's
talking
about
the
costs--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
cost
of
the
project
when
they
are
doing
the
appraisal.
when
they
are
coming
up
with
the
cost
for
how
much
it's
going
to
cost
to
stick
the
pipes
in
the
ground,
they
have
a
law
that
it
has
to
be
divided
equally
among
the
lots.
that's
an
assessment,
there
is
a
specific
provision.
you
had
can
challenge
the
assessment
if
you
don't
like
it.
once
you
don't
challenge
it
it's
final.
there
is
two
provisions
in
the
barrett
law
that
you
won't
search
in
vein
for
that
talk
about
the
interest
of
finality,
which
is
yet
another
reason
that
justifies
the
differential
treatment
here
between
people
who
paid
have
in
full,
their
accounts
are
closed
and
people
who
have
ongoing
outstanding
balances.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
are
referring
to
the
costs
of
the
project,
the
improvement.
that
will
then
be
reflected--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
it's
the
costs
that
are
then
reflected
in
the
assessment
on
each
lot.
and
there's
then
a
process
for
challenging
that
assessment
on
the
assumption
that
the
costs
are
allocated
equally
to
each
lot,
and
then
when
that's
done,
the
finality
provisions
kick
in.
and
nobody
says
there
was
anything
wrong.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
that's
not.
the
--
the
original
idea
is
--
sure,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
assess
the
costs
of
the
project
equally
among
everybody
whose
benefiting
from
the
project.
and
then
we're
going
to
have
an
assessment,
and
if
the
barrett
law
doesn't
change,
the
assumption
is
everybody's
going
to
pay
the
same
amount.
i'm
not
here
to
tell
you
otherwise,
but
the
point
is,
the
barrett
law,
like
most
laws,
doesn't
have
a
clause
that
plans
for
its
own
demise.
it
doesn't
say,
well,
you
know,
if
--
if
we
get
rid
of
this
law,
we
either
will
or
will
not
enforce
the
installments.
and
i
think
the
question
here
is
at
a
different
point
in
time
when
they
have
made
a
different
judgment.
we
don't
like
the
barrett
law.
it's
proven
unpopular.
it's
proven
unwieldy.
it's
not
just
popularity
or
political,
it's
that,
you
know,
they
were
facing
lots
of
low-income
subdivisions
with
septic
tanks,
and,
you
know,
they
are
forcing
the
prospect
of
trying
to
get
people
to
pay
$10,000
to
improve
a
--
the
sewer
on
a
house
that
is
worth
$50,000.
they
realize
that's
a
non-starter.
we
have
got
to
get
out
of
this
business.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it's
just
popularity.
you
know,
every
once
in
a
while
the
people
have
a
point.
and
it's
not
just
they
don't
like
something,
it's
the
right
to
not
like
it.
and
they
are
very
much
right
to
not
like
the
law
that
says
you
have
a
$50,000
house
and
we
are
going
to
make
you
pay
for
a
$10,000
sewer
hook-up.
they
were
right
to
get
out
of
the
business.
having
done
that
i
don't
understand
why
they
are
saddled
with
a
provision
of
law
that
exists
in
the
old
law
that
they
are
trying
to
get
away
from.
and
just
to
be
clear
--
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
look
at
a
case
that
i
think
shows
you
why
the
state
law
is
not
as
equality
ueber
alles,
as
they
are
presenting.
take
a
look
at
the
old
indiana
case
called
allendorf,
176
n.e.
240.
that's
a
case
where
somebody
in
the
project
challenged
the
--
the
assessment,
said
that's
unfair,
it's
too
much.
other
people
paid
in
full.
the
people
who
challenged
it
went
to
court.
they
eventually
settled
with
the
city
for
a
reduced
amount.
then
later
on
the
people
who
had
paid
in
full
went
into
court
and
said
we
are
entitled
to
pay
no
more
than
those
guys.
you
know
what
the
indiana
appellate
court
said?
no
dice.
that
doesn't
work.
you
basically
--
you
either
waived
your
right
and
express
waiver
or
if
you
paid
in
full,
it's
--
you
know,
too
late,
it's
too
late.
so
the
--
and
this
is
--
with
respect
i
think
part
of
the
problem
with
the
allegheny
pittsburgh,
in
particularly
this
extension
of
it,
you
are
putting
so
much
weight
on
the
state
law,
and
it
gets
you
in
this
business
of
flyspecking
the
barrett
law.
i
mean
--
you
know,
this
--
i
mean,
justice
thomas
made
this
point
very
well
in
the
nordlinger
case
that
there
is
an
anomaly
here,
which
is
you
looking
--
supposed
to
be
looking
at
federal
law
and
the
violation
seems
to
be
tied
to
potentially
a
violation
of
state
law.
if
i
could
focus
on
that
for
a
minute,
because
this
is
another
really
important
difference
between
allegheny
pittsburgh
and
this
case,
which
speaks
right
to
the
remedy.
in
allegheny
pittsburgh,
it's
a
facially
neutral
statute.
and
so
it
would
be
an
anomaly
there
to
say
that
when
there's
a
facially
neutral
statute,
you're
going
to
invalidate
the
--
the
statute.
the
statute's
fine.
the
problem
is,
you've
been
assessed
at
100
percent,
everybody
else
has
been
assessed
at
50
percent.
the
court
in
that
unique
context
says,
you
know,
there's
no
obligation
to
go
and
sort
of
mandamus
the
assessor,
to
bring
everybody
else
up.
you
get
to
sort
of
go
back
to
that
level.
this
is
very
different.
the
challenge
here,
like
in
nordlinger,
is
a
challenge
to
a
distinction
drawn
in
a
law.
resolution
101,
unlike
the
law
in
allegheny
pittsburgh,
is
not
facially
neutral.
it
draws
a
distinction.
so
the
relevant
question
is
the
rationality
of
that
distinction.
is
it
rational?
we
submit
there
are
multiple
reasons
why
it
is
rational.
but
if
you
disagree
with
me,
the
obvious
remedy
is
to
strike
down
the
statute,
or
at
least
remand
to
the
state
court
with
express
instructions
that
they
have
the
option,
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
sex
discrimination
cases.
and
justice
scalia,
if
you're
worried
about
incentives
and
standing,
look
at
heckler
v.
mathews.
another
sex
discrimination
case.
this
exact
issue
came
up.
and
what
the
court
said
is
standing
is
based
on
your
right
to
guarantee
equal
treatment.
whether
or
not
it's
a
pocketbook
injury,
you
have
standing
if
you're
denied
equal
treatment.
now,
these
guys
may
have
been
denied
equal
treatment
on
the
assumption
they're
right.
but
they
can
get
equal
treatment
restored
just
as
easily
by
resolution
101
being
invalidated
in
full
as
they
can
by
getting
an
additional
windfall
by
getting
a
refund.
and
as
justice
alito--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
but,
i
mean,
that's
a
big
difference,
because
that's
different
from
what
they're
saying.
they're
saying
there's
no
remedial
option.
they're
saying
we
are
stuck
now.
we
--
we
have
to
give
refunds.
that's
the
only
permissible
constitutional
remedy.
and
obviously,
the
city
would
prefer
to
get
out
of
the
barrett
law
business
and
to
provide
these
forgiveness,
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
lot
better
for
the
city
if
they
would
at
least
--
as
the
court
made
clear,
they
had
the
option
of
levelling
up
or
levelling
down.
i
do
think,
though,
that
gets
to
justice
kagan's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
that
were
the
rule,
heckler
v.
mathews
would
have
come
out
the
other
way.
the
court
was
--
you
know,
the
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
they
were
talking
about
a
specific
situation
and
a
federal
law.
so
i
don't
know
why
the
rule
would
be
the
same.
and
the
sex
discrimination
cases
are
much
more
on
point
for
purposes
of
this.
but
they're
also
talking
about
a
very
specific
context
where
you
have
a
limitation
on
a
benefit.
and
the
idea
is,
if
you
strike
down
the
limitation,
the
default
option
is
everybody
gets
the
benefit.
this
is
different.
i
mean,
you
know,
really
what
heckler
is
talking
about
is
severability
concerns.
there's
no
severability
that
works
here.
resolution
101,
if
you
look
at
it,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
refunds.
it
simply
says
we're
going
to
forgive
the
balances
on
the
outstanding
accounts.
if
that's
somehow
impermissible,
then
the
law
goes.
there's
nothing
to
sever.
there's
nothing
--
there's
not
one
word
in
the
statute
about
refunds,
and
that's
different
from
the
context
where
you
have
a
general
extension
of
benefits
and
you
have
similar
limitations
than
a
bank
would
have--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
--
and
in
what
amount?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
you're
absolutely
right.
i
talked
about
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
then
the
answer
is,
it
would
be
an
administrative
nightmare.
if
i
understand
the
question--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
what
i
heard
him
say
is
we
probably
would.
and
i
think
we
certainly
would
as
to
most
of
the
projects.
there
might
be
a
couple
of
the
projects
where
the
differences
are
so
small
that
he
would
say
there's
no
gross
inequality
there.
but
as
to
most
of
the
other
projects,
there's
still
substantial
differences--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
involves
--
i
don't
know
--
i
know
the
number
of
projects.
it's
like
20
projects.
so
i'm
guessing
it's
at
least
1,000
people.
and
then
of
course,
somebody's
going
to
come
in
if
we
do
that,
as
you
suggested,
and
say
wait
a
second--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
--
the
stakes
in
the
other
case
without
interest
i
think
are
$2.7
million.
so,
you
know,
i
think
the
--
the
ballpark
figures
are
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
--
it's
a
class
action
that
tops
the
federal
litigation.
but
still,
that's
not
a
--
that's
not
an
insubstantial
amount.
of
course,
the
relevant
question
is
not,
you
know,
are
the
damages
a
set
figure
after
you've
had
litigation
in
federal
court.
the
question
is:
what
is
the
city
administrator,
at
the
time
he
has
to
decide
whether
he
has
a
refund
obligation,
to
do?
and,
justice
scalia,
you
said
well,
it's
clear
as
mud.
i
mean,
did
you
listen
to
the
answer
about
gross
inequality?
what,
are
they
supposed
to
run
it
through
the
gross
inequality
calculator
that
tells
them
well,
you
know,
it's
close,
but
it's
not
really
--
there's
not
a
discrete
obligation?
i
don't
know
--
i
would
not
know
how
to
advise
them,
as
to
which
of
the
other
212
projects
they
owed
a
refund
to,
and
which
they
didn't.
i
would
be
at
a
complete
loss.
and
the
reason--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
actually
it
would
--
plus
this
one.
so
it
would
be
a
little
over
3.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
in
this
case.
and
the
--
and
the
law
you
develop
is
not
going
to
be
limited
to
this
case;
it's
going
to
apply
in
other
contexts
as
well.
heaven
knows
where
it
stops.
as
i
said,
allegheny
pittsburgh,
it
was
at
least
limited
to
a
particular
context.
now,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
any
city
ever
--
i
mean,
maybe
this
is
the
limiting
principle
--
that
no
city
ever
again
will
provide
amnesty
or
forgiveness
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
--
it's
the
same
principle.
i
mean,
i
could
certainly
see
some
--
you
know,
suppose
the
city
elects
a
laissez
faire
mayor,
and
says
you
know
what,
parking
tickets,
it's
not
worth
the
hassle;
we
are
going
to
getting
out
of
the
parking
ticket
enforcement
business,
and
we
are
going
to
forgive
everybody
their
parking
tickets.
if
i
had
just
paid
my
parking
tickets
i
would
be
hacked
off.
but
i
wouldn't
feel
like
i
had
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
get
my
money
back.
and
that's
the
difference--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
if
they
really
got
rid
of
the
--
the
federal
tax
forever,
i
don't
think
there
wouldn't
be
an
equal
protection
violation.
i
think
there
might
be
a
different
constitutional
violation.
if
you
listen
to
him,
the
first
thing
he
ticked
off
about
why
that
would
be
so
horrible,
is
there
was
no
notice.
well,
that
sounds
like
a
due
process
concern
to
me,
not
an
equal
protection
concern.
and
that's
really
what's
happening
here.
when
they
transport
allegheny
pittsburgh
from
the
context
it
arose
in
to
this
very
different
context,
they
are
converting
it
from
an
equal
protection
case
to
something
more
like
a
contract
clause
case,
or
to
a
winstar
case,
or
something
like
that.
and
not
one
word
in
that
opinion
suggests
that
once
a
state
adopts
a
certain
policy,
that
it's
trapped.
it
can't
make
a
reasonable
and
rational
transition
away
from
that
policy
to
a
policy
that
better
serves
the
citizenry.
and
if
it
doesn't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
one
--
i
don't
think
there
is
a
demographic
difference.
i
think
the
one
concrete
difference
that
really
is
a
difference
is
from
the
city's
perspective,
they
are
looking
at
two
groups
all
of
whom
are
going
to
have
to
pay
a
new
higher
monthly
fee;
and
i
think
they
can
a
rational
decision
that
says
look,
you
know,
one
of
these
groups
has
to
make
two
monthly
payments
to
the
city
for
sewer
and
water.
that
seems
a
little
crazy.
so
why
are
we
--
what
we
will
do
is
we
will
just
make
everybody
in
the
city
in
terms
of
or
their
ongoing
payments
to
the
city
for
sewer
and
water,
we
will
treat
them
all
exactly
the
same.
one
fee.
thank
you.
