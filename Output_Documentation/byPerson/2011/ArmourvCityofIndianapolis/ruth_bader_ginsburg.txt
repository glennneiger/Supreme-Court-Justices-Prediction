mr.
stancil,
who
are
these
people?
we
have
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
and
there
was
a
judgment
in
the
court
of
first
instance
in
the
appellate
court,
for
a
dollar
amount,
but
we're
told
there
are
many
more
of
these
barrett
law
projects,
and
that
they
all
operate
the
same
way.
so
the
result
is
a
lot
more
money
than
these
plaintiffs
are
claiming,
is
that
not
so?
if
your
position
under
the
law
is
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
that
a
choice
for
the
legislature?
because
everybody
could
be
treated
equally
by
getting
their
money
back,
or
nobody
gets
out
from
under
the
old
system.
so
why
shouldn't
that
be
--
the
decision
is
you
can't
treat
these
two
groups
of
people
differently,
so
i
think
the
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases
you
can
equalize
up
or
down
as
a
legislative
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
go
either
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
up
to
the
oklahoma
legislature.
they
could
make
it
21
for
everyone
and
18
for
everyone.
