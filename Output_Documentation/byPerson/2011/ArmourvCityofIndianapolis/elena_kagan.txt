that
counts
as
a
gross
disparity?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
does
is
my
question.
how
--
how
do
you
separate
a
gross
disparity
from
a
non-gross
disparity.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stancil,
if
that's
right,
and
let's
take
a
case
which
is
different
from
the
one
that
--
that
you're
saying.
let's
take
a
case
where
there
are
many,
many,
many
more
open
projects,
involving
much,
much
more
costs
than
you
are
saying
is
true
here.
and
the
mayor
looks
at
this
and
says,
you
know
what,
unless
i
can
just
draw
the
line
here,
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
change
this
financing
system.
either
--
unless
i
can
draw
the
line
here,
or
unless
i
can
say
nobody
gets
any
money.
what's
a
mayor
to
do?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
i
--
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
is,
we
have
this
terrible
program;
everybody
hates
it;
it's
not
fulfilling
its
intended
purposes;
the
mayor
and
everybody
else
wants
to
change
it.
how
is
the
mayor
going
to
change
this
program
now.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
suggesting--
justice
elena
kagan
--that
that
is
financially
prohibitive.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
isn't
that
what
you
are
saying,
mr.
stancil?
is
what
you
are
saying
that
when
cities
create
tax
policy,
they
can't
think
about
the
budget
implications
of
that
tax
policy?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stancil,
here
is
what
worries
me
about
this
case.
to
me,
this
is
a
case
about
transition
rules.
all
legislation
creates
classes
of
citizens
and
some
are
--
and
puts
them
all
in
a
group,
and
says
you
are
going
to
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
long
as
this
legislation
exists.
and
then
a
legislature
comes
along
and
changes
that
piece
of
legislation,
and
different
people
are
affected
differently
by
it.
and
to
me
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
when
that
break
is
made
and
when
that
transition
occurs,
the
--
i
don't
know
how
you
would
apply
the
rule
that
you
were
suggesting,
which
is
that
everybody
in
the
former
class
has
to
be
treated
the
same
as
a
matter
of
transition
policy.
