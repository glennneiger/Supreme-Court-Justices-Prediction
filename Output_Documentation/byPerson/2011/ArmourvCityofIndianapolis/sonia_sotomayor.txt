justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
understand
your
arguments.
your
adversary
raises
a
point
that
concerns
me,
which
is
what
happens
to
all
other
amnesty
programs
like
parking
ticket
amnesties?
and
if
you
take
your
logic
to
an
extreme,
how
about
something
that
doesn't
involve
money
but
immigration
status
amnesty,
illegal
aliens
who
can
apply
for
citizenship
and
be
forgiven
their
illegal
entry?
doesn't
the
logic
of
your
theory
basically
mean
that
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
the
government
could
treat
people
differently?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
every
time
a
police
officer
stops
me
for
a
traffic
violation,
i
get
angry
when
he
lets
somebody
else
go.
so
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
a
difference
between
that
and
this
case
where
the
government
is
basically
saying,
you
owe
me
something
and
i'm
going
to
forgive
you
what
you
owe
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
see,
the
problem
that
i
have
is
that
you're
trying
to
lop
off
half
of
the
project,
which
is
was
what
was
the
barrett
project
--
without
looking
at
what
the
new
project
is.
and
that
goes
to
what
justice
breyer's
point
was.
moving
forward,
every
old
project
and
every
new
project
is
going
to
pay
more
money
than
they
did
under
the
barrett
law,
because
i
think,
if
i
understand
correctly,
the
city
is
raising
a
--
essentially
not
a
flat
fee,
but
a
fee
--
assessing
a
flat
fee
across
all
taxpayers
so
that
these
sewer
lines
can
be
built.
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
--
but
it
says
that
new
people
are
going
to
pay
a
flat
fee.
old
people
are
going
to
pay
$10
more
a
month
that
they
didn't
have
to
pay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
why
can't
they
come
in,
and
why
don't
they
come
in
and
say
exactly
what
justice
breyer
said:
you
forgave
the
payments
of
taxes
for
hooking
up
to
the
sewer
system
of
these
new
people
coming
in.
you're
treating
me
differently.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
so
everybody
else
says
i
want
to
pay
$2,500.
you're
still
not
dealing
with
the
fact
that
this
was
one
decision
tied
to
others.
it
was
a
package
deal.
and
so
that
the
rationality
of
this
package
deal
has
to
be
seen
in
context.
you
want
to
lop
it
off
and
say,
all
i'm
looking
at
is
how
much
these
taxpayers
paid
for
this
old
system,
not
what
the
new
system
is
creating.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
the
park
--
parking
amnesty
example
that
you
have
said
wasn't
the
same.
because
if
an
individual
taxpayer
has
filed
late,
it's
like
the
parking
guy
who
didn't
file
his
ticket,
either.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
really
are
saying
that
amnesty
programs
are
out
of
the
question
if
the
risk
is
imposed
equally
on
everyone.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
you
are
saying
if
you
forgive
the
parking
ticket,
that's
an
equal
protection
violation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
his
figure
of
$2
million
accurate?
the
stakes
in
the
other
case.
