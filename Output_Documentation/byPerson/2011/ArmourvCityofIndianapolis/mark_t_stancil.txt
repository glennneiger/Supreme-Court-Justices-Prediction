mr.
mark
t.
stancil
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
chose
a
method
for
abandoning
its
sewer
funding
mechanism
that
left
petitioners
paying
30
times
more
than
their
next
door
neighbors
to
connect
to
their
neighborhood
sewer
project
simply
because
petitioners
had
paid
their
tax
bills
in
full.
mere
timing
of
payment
does
not
render
similarly
situated
taxpayers
into
similar
groups.
and
that
is
particularly
true
here
where
the
taxpayers
are
a
discreetly
defined
group
of
homeowners
sharing
equally
in
a
common
specific
benefit
and
state
law
specifically
defines
them
as
similarly
situated.
the
city's
principal
contention
is
that
jettisoning
the
barrett
law,
they
waived
a
fundity
of
initial
taxation,
was
itself
an
end
for
this
justification
and
itself
justified
the
gross
disparity
imposed
on
petitioner
--
on
petitioners.
that
does
not.
the
fact
that
an
arbitrary
classification
may
yield
a
desirable
result
does
not
render
it
any
less
arbitrary.
the
city
must
have
a
reason
for
drawing
the
distinction;
but
paying
ones
taxes
in
good
faith
does
not
equal
treatment.
indeed
state
law
here
makes
clear
that
delaying
payment
by
choosing
an
installment
plan
does
not
put
a
taxpayer
on
special
footing.
for
example,
the
barrett
law
declares
that
installment
payments
"shall
be
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
other
taxes.
"
and
installment
payments
are
automatically
secured
by
a
lien
against
the
property.
taxpayers
who
select
the
installment
plan,
which
they
may
do
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
whatsoever;
and
in
fact,
if
they
make
no
choice,
they
default
into
the
installment
plan.
they
are
required,
if
the
city
asks
as
it
did
here,
to
sign
an
agreement,
agreeing
to
pay
the
installments
in
full
with
interest
and
not
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
underlying
assessment.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.
for
starters,
this
court's
equal
protection
and
rational
bases
cases
in
particular
make
clear
context
is
key.
so
forgiving
a
penalty
imposed
on
a
speeder,
for
example,
who
has
an
overdue
ticket
or
parking
ticket
is
qualitatively
different
judgment
than
forgiving
the
underlying
tax
liability
broad--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor.
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
engquist
took
that
specific
example
on,
not
with
you
in
mind
presumably,
but
took
that
example
on
specifically
and
it
said:
this
is
the
kind
of
action
itself
that
is
inherently
a
subjective
individualized
determination.
it's
not
irrational
to
pull
over
one
traffic
violator
and
not
another
because
that's
the
nature
of
the
enforcement
action.
that
is
qualitatively
different
from
a
tax
imposed
on
181
homeowners
who
live
next
door
to
each
other,
and
then
12
months
later
saying,
you
know,
31
of
you
are
going
to
pay
30
times
as
much
in
reality
as
the
other
150,
even
though--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor,
and
state
law
on
this
is
quite
clear.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
constitutional
law
looks
to
state
law.
that's
what
we
took
out
of
allegheny
pittsburgh
v.
nordlinger.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
but
i
will
back
up.
i'll
do
it
both
ways,
your
honor.
state
law
says
the
following
taxpayers
are
similarly
situated,
your
project
specific
to
your
neighborhood
because
those
are
the
people
to
whom
you
are
guaranteed
--
with
whom
you
are
guaranteed
equal
treatment.
it
is
not
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
certain
price
for
a
sewer
connection
under
this
law.
it's--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--because
they
are
not
similarly
situated.
because--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--because
your
--
the
states
have
flexibility
to
define
at
the
outset
who
is
similarly
situated.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor,
but
they
have
a
basis
for
stating
that.
they
don't
just--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--that's
not
what
this
court's
cases
say.
it's
not
the
fact
that
you
need
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
i
will
take
the
case
that
respondents
rely
on
heavily
fcc
v.
beach--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor.
i'll
back
up
again.
so,
we
do
have
a
specific
definition
of
who
is
and
who
is
not
entitled
to
equal
treatment
or
roughly
equal
treatment.
so
that's
under
state
law.
so
they
already
committed
to
who
is
and
who
is
not
similarly
situated.
all
you
need
to
decide
in
this
case
and
this
is
broad
as
in
homeowners
on
these
people
who
are
promised
you
will
pay
the
very
same
as
your
next
neighbor
that
you
will
pay
the
same
amount
for
the
this
pipe
that
you
will
flush
your
toilet
into.
are
they
going
to
change
their
mind
and
say
you
are
going
to
pay
30
times
as
much?
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
if
we
are
correct,
the
city
will
end
up
paying
a
little
more
than
in
our
specific
case
but
i
would
like
to
explain
why
and
how
much
because
it's
an
important
distinction.
there
are
about
21
barrett
law
projects
that
still
have
balances
outstanding
many
of
them
are
almost
paid
off.
so
there
are
only
three
that
have
the
30-year
option.
the
rest
have
of
the
10-year
option.
anything
from
2001
prior.
so
in
fact
i
can
give
you
specific
numbers.
there
are
7
projects
that
are
less
than
--
that
are
half
paid
off
or
less
than
half
paid
off.
because
of
the
equal
protection
violation
is
only
triggered
by
gross
disparity
between
similarly
situated
taxpayers
the
city
may
or
may
not
have
to
refund
in
each
project
down
the
line.
if
you
are
nine
out
of
ten.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
don't
think
that
counts
as
a
gross
disparity.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
start
with
this
case,
which
is
easy.
it's
10
to
1
and
30
to
1.
it's
the
same
numbers
in
allegheny
pittsburgh.
but
even
if
you
drew
4
to
1
or
5
to
1
as
a
line,
as
the
court
has
done,
say,
in
punitive
damages
cases
where
it
suggested
outer
limits,
that
--
i
think
those
are
easy
lines
to
draw,
and
certainly
lines
that
the
lower
courts
could
draw.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
triggering
--
the
gross
disparity
triggers
the
violation.
and
the
question
is,
well,
what's
the
remedy
for
a
violation?
i
think
they'd
have
to
have
a
reason
for
saying
we're
going
to
with
--
it
would
be
the
very
definition
of
arbitrary
to
say
well,
even
though
you
are
entitled
to
equal
treatment
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
know,
and
even
though
we're
not
--
it's
not
--
liability
isn't
triggered
except
for
gross
disparities,
i
think
they
would
have
to
give
us
that
--
that
figure.
and,
your
honor,
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
get
back,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question
about
how
these
other
projects
--
there's
a
suggestion
by
respondents
that
there's
a
terrible
line
drawing
problem
in
how
do
we
calculate
these
benefits.
it's
simply
not
the
case.
we
have
this
federal
class
action
in
the
cox
case,
which
is
every
other
barrett
law
project
that's
active
except
ours.
we
opted
out.
the
damages
question
was
before
that
court,
because
--
because
the
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
position
that
this
is
an
equal
protection
violation.
the
city
put
together
a
damages
pleading,
and
it
--
and
it
produced
to
the
dollar
a
calculation
of
every
overpayment
in
every
barrett
law
project.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
two
reasons.
one,
you
are
not
promised
equal
treatment
under
state
law
to
those
other
projects;
you
were
promised
equal
treatment
with
the
people
you
live
next
door.
two,
you
use
a
different
pipe.
these
pipes
cost
different
amounts
of
money
to
put
in
different
places,
and
they're
done
over
time.
your
honor's
hypothetical
--
actually,
if
i
could
tweak
it
a
little
bit
--
it
--
the
question
is
not
who
comes
in
for
somebody
--
who
comes
in
from
a
project
last
month.
the
burning
question
is
who
comes
in
from
a
project
11
or
more
years
ago,
because
those
are
the
only
ones
that'll
still
be
in
repayment.
the
cox
--
if
we
win
--
well,
there's
a
repayment
plan.
that's
the
only
thing
that
creates
this
--
this
asymmetry.
the
only
people
who
are
going
to
come
in
and
say
well,
you
refunded
some
people
on
my
project
but
not
me
are
people
in
repayment,
so
it's
only
going
to
be
from
a
project
'95
and
forward.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
for
future
sewer
projects
that
they
start,
each
person
who
connects
to
that
new
pipe
pays
a
$2,500
flat
fee.
every
resident
citywide
who
uses
the
municipal
sewer
--
new,
old,
or
whatever
--
pays
an
extra
about
$10
a
month
under
the
new
system.
so
what
they
did
is
they
decided
this
program,
the
barrett
law,
is
politically
very
unpopular;
we
would
like
to
get
rid
of
it.
fair
enough.
but
they
chose
a
way
to
do
it.
they
said
well,
we're
going
to
be
completely
ignorant
of--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--right.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
they
should
--
there's
nobody
who
will
pay
more
under
the
new
system
than
my
clients,
because
the
new
people
pay
$2,500
and
the
same
monthly
fees
that
now
every
indiana
resident
pays.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
but
that's
because
under
this
court's
equal
protection
cases,
they
have
to
have
a
reason
for
this
particular
line.
they
can't
say
we
have
a
general
objective
and
it
doesn't
matter
if
we
pursue
it--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes.
they
have
--
they're
in
various
states
of
repayment.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
they
all
got
refunds
--
or
their
balances
were
completely
forgiven.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
look
--
let
me
make
clear,
2
through
20
are--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i'm
not
sure.
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
that
--
that
fact.
2
through
20
are
actually
older
projects--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--so
they
owe
less
money.
and
--
and
they
come
into
the
mayor
and
they
say:
where's
my
money?
i
paid
in
full.
i
paid
my--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--9,000,
but
joe
over
here
got
his
last
$1,000
forgiven.
here's
what
the
mayor
says.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the
mayor
says,
i
talked
to
my
lawyers.
if
it's
a
grossly
disproportionate
burden.
so,
if
you
end
up
paying
grossly
disproportionately
to
your
next-door
neighbor,
because
that's
what
allegheny
pittsburgh
and
nordlinger
and
all
the
court's
cases
say,
then
i'm
entitled
--
i
have
to
give
you
a
refund.
but,
if
you
end
up
paying
10
percent
more
than
the
other
person
to
connect
to
this
pipe,
that's
just
not
an--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--in
my
case,
there's
$273,391.63.
in
the
cox
case,
$2,783,702.59,
on
the
assumption
that
all
of
those
people
are
grossly
disproportionately
burdened.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
that's
--
that's
what
it
said
in
cox.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
this
was
specifically
addressed
in
allegheny
pittsburgh.
that's
exactly
what
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
said.
they
said,
well,
if
you
have
any
remedies
--
only
to
raise
the
taxes
on
other
people.
and
this
court
specifically
rejected
that.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
right.
i'm
already
unpopular--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i'm
unpopular
in
indianapolis
as
it
is.
if
i
went
back
and
just
raised
everybody's
taxes,
i'll
--
i'll
never
get
to
go
home.
[laughter]
but,
again,
this
--
and
that's
just
the
practical
reality.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
it
was
a
legislative
choice,
justice
ginsburg.
but
having
now
made
a
choice
that
inflicts
a
constitutional
violation,
this
court's
cases
are
clear.
the
correct
and
the
default
rule
is
refunds,
because
--
for
exactly
the
reason
justice
scalia
raised.
even
if
it's
possible
to
go
back
and
do
that,
which
--
it
isn't
always
the
case
--
but
even
if
it's
possible,
that
just
means
the
equal
protection
cases
and
tax
cases
don't
get
brought,
because
the
most
you
can
hope
to
get
is--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
again,
i
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
making
a
big
mess
isn't
a
justification
for
arbitrarily
ending
it.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
there
are
two
ways
he
could
have
changed
this
program.
one,
he
could
have
offered
us
refunds.
two--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
know--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
will
pay
for
it
then,
because
he
can
go
and
he
could
--
he
could
have
done
two
things
here.
they
could
have
--
and
i'm
using
the
mayor
loosely;
it's
actually
the
board
of
public
works
and
the
city-county
council.
but
he
could
have
increased
that
monthly
fee
under
the
new
program.
there
actually
--
these
sewer
projects
still
cost
the
same.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
and
i--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no.
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
when
they
want
to
change
tax
policy,
having
already
said
these
taxpayers
are
the
same
and
entitled
under
law
to
equal
treatment,
they
can't
just
say
it
would
be
too
expensive
on
us
to
treat
them
equally
when
unwinding
that
program.
this
court
in
plyler
has
said
resources
are
not
sufficient.
and
any
tax
case
could
be
justified.
if
the
--
if
the
city
says,
well,
you
know,
we
want
to
have
--
we
want
to
refund
x
dollars
to
our
taxpayers,
but
we
only
have
enough
to
refund
to
--
to
the
blonde
people
and
not
to
brunettes,
that's
arbitrary,
even
if
they
couldn't
afford
to
do
it
other
ways
--
another
way.
so
they
can't
just
pick
a
method
that
sort
of
where
the
math
works
out
or
is
convenient,
and
just
say
well,
that's
the
way
we
could
have
done
it.
i
would,
if
i
could,
just
return
to
the
practical
ways
they
could
have
done
this.
and
i
think
that
highlights
just
how
arbitrary
this
line
was.
they
could
have
increased
those
monthly
fees
under
step,
the
new
program.
i
mean,
that's
how
they
paid
for
the
rest
of
these
projects.
they
are
paying
off
the
bonds
of
the
old
projects
by
charging
everybody
in
indianapolis
$10
more
a
month.
they
could
have
just
collected
--
in
our
project,
they
could
have
collected
for
2
more
years.
they
could
have
said
you
will
be
forgiven
--
i
think
it's
about
27
months.
we
are
going
to
forgive
your
balances
as
of,
you
know,
whatever
that
would
be
--
june
of
2010,
whatever
it
would
be.
or
2007
--
collected
that
money,
and
then
they
would
have
had
the
cash
to
refund
to
the
people
who
had
paid
an
inequal
amount
that
they
were
forgiving
to
the
others.
so
i
think
--
i
think
that's
sort
of,
it's
a
red
herring
to
say
gosh,
we
had
no
other
way,
or
we
only
had
these
options
a,
b,
and
c.
i'd
like
to
--
i
really
want
just
to
drill
down
on
an
illustration
of
just
how
crazy
i
think
this
is.
suppose
if
the
united
states
decides
tomorrow
to
go
to
a
national
sales
tax
instead
of
the
federal
income
tax.
it's
february
29th;
millions
of
people
have
paid
their
taxes
for
2011;
many,
many
--
most
of
us
have
not
yet
paid.
could
the
irs
come
in
and
say,
well
if
you
have
already
filed
and
paid
your
taxes
for
2011,
too
bad.
but
lucky
you,
if
you
are
a
late
filer,
you
are
going
to
get
your
entire
tax
bill
forgiven?
i
don't
think
that
is
remotely
close.
i
think
that
is
arbitrary,
and
i
will
give
you
a
couple
of
reasons.
one,
absolutely
no
notice.
so
the
timing
of
payment,
the
method
of
payment
that
was
selected,
gives
those
taxpayers
absolutely
no
notice
as
to
some
constitutional
significance
that
attaches
to
it.
and
i
don't
think
--
and
i
can
tell
you
from
talking
to
my
clients,
they
don't
--
they
didn't
think
that
by
paying
upfront
in
full
that
they
had
--
they
were
somehow
sacrificing
their
chance
to
equal
treatment.
or
that
the
city
might
some
day
wipe
out
97
percent
of
their
neighbors'
tax
obligations.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor.
in
the
parking
ticket
example,
forgiving
a
penalty
for
late
payment
is
a
qualitatively
different
--
to
borrow
from
engquist
again,
"a
subjectively
individualized
determination"
designed
to
achieve
another
goal,
a
legitimate
goal
in
itself.
pay
your
parking
ticket,
and
we
will
let
the
penalty
go.
that
is
different.
so
if
my
clients
were
here
saying,
well,
you're
not
charging
me--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
--
i
mean,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
again,
it's
context-driven.
the
parking--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--it's
not,
your
honor.
and
i
will
say--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--it's
not
reasonable,
your
honor.
it
rests
on
the
faulty
premise
that
this
is
some
administratively--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--your
honor,
i
mean
--
there's
one
--
there's
somebody
not
here
in
this
case
that
i
think
belies
this
notion--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--that
this
is
going
against
the
tax
code
broadly
or
amnesty
forgiveness
decisions
generally.
if
--
if
--
i
think
if
people
really
thought
that
this
case
was
going
to
foul
up
the
tax
code
of
forgiveness,
i
think
the
irs
would
be
here
or
the
united
states
would
be
here
saying,
this
is
very
similar
to
what
we
do
on
a
daily
basis
in
compromising
debt--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
correct,
your
honor,
and
again,
the
administrative
burden
there
was
actually
quite
significant.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
not
when
it
takes
only
three
pages.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
there
are
four--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes.
four
separate
provisions
of
the
barrett
law
--
just
--
i
will
rattle
them
off
for
you.
first,
it
says
installment
payments
shall
be
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
other
taxes.
it
actually
says
"shall
collect"
two
other
times.
requires
a
lien.
it
says
that
municipal
officials
who
don't
collect
installment
payments
can
actually
be
held
personally
liable
and
removed
from
office
for
failing
to
discharge
their
duties.
that's
on
pages
2a
to
3a
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
sensible
way
to
read
the
barrett
law
as
saying
it
doesn't
require
payment,
and
none
of
the
state
court
judges
who
have
looked
at
this
have
suggested
that.
and--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
suppose
they
could,
your
honor.
i,
again
i'd
argue
that--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
under
--
under
the
contract
clause.
but
could
i
flip
it
and
suggest
that
if
a
state
wanted
to
preserve
its
right
to
forgive
willy-nilly,
they
could
include
a
provision
in
their
law
that
says
by
the
way,
if
you
choose
an
installment
plan
and
we
change
our
policy,
there
shall
be
--
you
are
not
entitled
to
equal
treatment
with
people
who
pay
upfront.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
right.
and
let's
--
we
will
see
who
pays
upfront
under
that
system.
[laughter]
if
i
can,
your
honor,
again,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
justice
alito,
i
want
to
just
pick
up
right
there.
what
they
are
actually
saying
on
these
two
monthly
payments
idea
is
that
it's
rational
for
somebody
who's
just
who
just
paid
$300,
and
now
everybody
pays
an
extra
$10
a
month,
we
don't
want
them
to
have
to
make
their
$30
a
month
barrett
law
payment
having
paid
$300,
and
the
extra
10.
my
clients
still
have
to
pay
the
extra
$10
a
month,
but
we
are
out
of
pocket
$9,300.
i
think
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
patently
irrational,
to
say
that
--
that
we
are
trying
to
help
people
who
are
out
300
bucks
from
having
to
pay
an
extra
30
bucks
going
forward.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
if
you've
promised
equal
treatment
--
and
we're
talking
about
a
--
this
is
a
--
a
specific
case.
a
specific
commonly
shared
benefit
among
people
who
are
indistinguishable
on
any
rational
basis.
they
live
next
to
door
to
each
other;
they
flush
into
the
same
pipes;
and
they
paid
and
were
promised
equal
payments.
in
that
instance
you
--
then
there
has
to
be
a
rational
method.
you
have
to
treat
them
equally
when
you
transition.
so
there
may
be
times
where
the
city
has
promised
and
committed
and
there
is
no
independent
rational
basis
for
distinguishing.
it's
not
that
if
we
want
to
go
forward
and
we
want
to
tax
blondes
instead
of
brunettes,
well,
the
fact
that
we
are
going
to
start
doing
that
prospectively
doesn't
make
that
okay.
and
moreover,
this
isn't
prospective.
we
are
talking
about
an
assessment
historically
imposed
on
the
very
same
--
for
the
very
same.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
if
we
--
i'm
sorry.
i
thought--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--right.
because
we
would
all
be
treated
equally.
could
i
quickly
get
to
the
administrative
nightmare?
in
--
if
you
go
to
the
cox
litigation
and
go
on
pacer,
and
you
pull
up
document
number
98,
you
will
find
the
city's
filing
in
the
cox
case,
in
which
they
give
the
name
and
address
and
amount
of
owed
to
every
taxpayer
under
any
of
these
20
other
barrett
law
projects.
this
is
--
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
ludicrous
to
say
there
is
some
gordian
knot
that
would
have
to
be
cut
to
issue
refunds.
but
more
generally,
i
think
this
is
part
of
the
city's
argument.
they
say
well,
perfection
may
be
difficult
to
achieve.
well,
so
be
it.
it
always
is;
but
that
does
not
justify
gross
disparities
and
"anything
goes".
you
may
want
to
make
a
clean
break
and
go
to
a
new
system,
fine.
but
you
have
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
treats
the
--
the
same.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
if
that's
the
case--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor.
simply
sending
in
your
tax
bill
--
again,
if
you
sent
in
your
taxes
yesterday,
are
you
"too
bad,
so
sad"?
i
don't
think
that
is
rational.
and
i
want
to
get
back
to
reliance
interest
because
--
i
can't.
