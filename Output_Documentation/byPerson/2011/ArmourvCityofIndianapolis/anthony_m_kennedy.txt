can
you
tell
me
--
i'm
curious
to
know,
if
other
states
have
provisions
like
the
barrett
law
and
they
are
concerned
about
this,
can
they
provide
in
the
initial
documents
a
--
a
promise
that
there
will
be
no
forgiveness,
so
that
there
would
be
a
contract
clause
sort
of
argument
against
what
happened
here?
in
other
words
--
and
if
we
could
explore
that
for
just
a
minute,
i'm
going
to
ask
what
it
is
that
you
thought
constituted
a
promise
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
maybe
not
a
promise
in
the
contract
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
other
aspect
of
my
case,
do
you
think
other
states
could
provide
protection
against
this,
in
the
event
that
you
do
not
prevail
here,
and
--
and
put
in
the
documents
that
--
that
it
is
understood
that
a
condition
for
your
approving
of
this
--
these
sewers,
will
be
that
there
will
be
no
forgiveness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
then
be
enforceable
under
the
contract
clause,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
give
you
a
warning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so,
i
think
maybe
if
you
prevail
in
this
opinion,
we
should
say
the
principle
we
are
adopting
in
this
case
is:
don't
trust
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
dispute
that
the
city
would
have
that
option
if
we
rule
against
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
to
forgive
the
unpaid
balances.
the
city
has
the
option,
i
assume.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
big
difference.
in
one
case
there
is
an
expectation
and
in
the
other
case
there
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
just
--
that
just
underscores
the
promise
of
the
state
or
the
city
that
all
owners
will
be
treated
equally.
that
just
underscores
the
point
that
that
was
the
understanding
and
the
commitment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
--
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
a
big
deal
for
us?
that's
the
law,
you
get
your
--
your
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
can
you
do
with
the
hypothetical
about
the
income
tax
and
the
sales
tax?
so
you
don't
pay
any
income
tax
if
the
sales
tax
had
gone
into
effect.
