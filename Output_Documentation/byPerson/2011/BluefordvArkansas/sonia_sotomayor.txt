justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
one--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
i
thought
that
part
of
your
argument
was
that,
given
the
instructions
in
this
case,
which
the
jury
appears
to
have
followed
to
the
t,
they
can't
get
to
a
lesser
count
unless
they
have
acquitted
on
the
preceding
count.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
the
judge
asks
them,
did
you
reach
criminal
negligence,
they
say:
we
were
told
not
to.
now,
the
judge,
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
under
hughes
as
to
whether
they
followed
the
instructions
or
he
misunderstood
them,
i
don't
know.
but
it's
very
clear
in
context
from
the
government's
arguments
to
the
jury,
to
the
defense
argument
to
the
jury,
you
don't
reach
the
split
count
or
even
talk
about
it
unless
you've
been
acquitted.
so,
given
that
the
jury
responds
at
the
end,
we
haven't
reached
a
verdict;
and
the
jury
said
earlier
that
they
hadn't
reached
a
verdict
on
the
one
issue,
isn't
the
--
the
only
assumption
is
that
they
didn't
go
back?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
what
do
several
states
have?
if
i
read
what
those
states
you're
saying,
including
the
massachusetts
state
that
you
point
to,
it's
a
very
simple
rule,
and
you
seem
to
be
arguing
past
it
or
around
it
or
--
i
think
what
they
say
is,
once
the
jury
announces
an
acquittal,
then
that's
the
substance,
the
person's
been
acquitted,
once
they
have
made
a
judgment
and
announced
it.
it
--
the
constitution
doesn't
--
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
entitle
someone
to
have
it
announced,
doesn't
entitle
someone
to
force
the
jury
to
announce
it.
but
if
the
jury
gets
up
at
the
end
of
the
trial
in
a
state
that
doesn't
permit
partial
verdicts
and
said,
contrary
to
the
instructions
of
the
judge,
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state,
the
jury
says,
we
acquitted
on
counts
one
and
two,
we're
hung
on
count
three,
the
constitution
says
jeopardy
attaches
because
there
has
been
an
announcement
of
a
verdict.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
our
case
in
ball
says
it
doesn't
matter
whether
a
judgment
is
entered
or
not.
as
far
back
as
1896,
ball
said
the
judgment
is
irrelevant.
it
is
the
verdict
of
acquittal,
and
it
basically
equated
that
verdict
with
--
it
doesn't
matter
if
--
if
it's
entered
properly,
if
the
jury
is
polled,
if
anything
happens.
it's
as
soon
as
the
jury
announces
acquittal,
that's
the
operative
double
jeopardy
kicker.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
i
thought
i
heard
you
arguing
that
here
the
lack
of
manifest
necessity
was
that
the
judge
had
heard
they
reached
that
verdict.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
he
should
not
have
discharged
the
jury
without
asking
them
could
they
reach
a
verdict
that
--
had
they
reached
the
verdict
that
they
announced.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i'm
so
totally
confused
by
you
ignoring
hughes.
the
arkansas
charge
says:
"if
you
have
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
defendant's
guilt
on
the
charge
of
capital
murder,
you
will
consider
the
charge
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
"
and
i
thought
the
arkansas
cases
said
no
one
juror
is
going
to
think
they
can
go
to
the
next
count.
they
have
to
understand
from
this
charge
that
it
has
to
be
unanimous.
and
that's
what
the
prosecutor
argued,
it's
what
the
defense
argued,
it's
what
your
supreme
court
has
said
has
to
happen.
i'm
a
little
confused
given
your
case
law,
your
supreme
court
case
law,
that
says
you
can't
move
on
to
the
next
one
unless
it's
unanimous.
how
you
can
answer
justice
kagan's
question
the
way
you
have.
there
is
nothing
in
your
case
law--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--for
instance
if
they
had
--
if
the
judge
had
called
them
back
in
and
said,
are
you
deadlocked
on
the
third
count.
and
my
hypothetical
to
your
adversary,
they
said,
well,
we
have
acquitted
on
capital
murder,
we've
acquitted
on
the
second
count,
we
are
still,
judge,
deadlocked.
if
this
had
been
announced
at
the
very
end,
what
would
be
your
position
today?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
doesn't
sound
like
the
judge
was
interested
in
any
of
the
defense
counsel's
positions
on
mistrial.
he
announced
whether
the
jury
told
them
they
were
deadlocked
or
not
he
was
going
to
call
them
back.
so
i
don't
know
that
the
judge
would
have
done
what
you
suggested.
because
the
judge
--
the
defense
attorney
did
ask
for
partial
verdicts
after
their
first
announcement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
the
state
rule
says
we
don't
take
partial
verdicts
and
the
judge
had
entered
a
verdict
--
a
judgment
--
declared
a
mistrial
or
entered
a
judgment
saying
hung
jury
as
to
all
counts,
would
jeopardy
have
attached.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
if
the
jury
had
announced
what
it
did,
but
following
arkansas
law,
as
you
read
it,
you
don't
take
partial
verdicts,
it
could
only
be
one
hung
jury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
jeopardy
has
attached.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
it's
reasonable
to
conclude
that
a
jury
that
has
been
told
acquit
first
comes
back
and
says,
we're
only
hung
on
this,
and
the
jury
says,
listen
to
each
other
on
what
your
hung
on,
that
that
jury
reasonably
--
the
judge
could
have
ignored
their
stated
verdict
and
entered
a
trial
--
a
mistrial
on
everything
else.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
how
do
you
deal
with
our
cases,
ball,
martin
linen,
and
the
whole
line
that
says
the
state
--
the
form
of
state
law
judgments
doesn't
control?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
what
that
means.
and
that's
the
problem
with
all
of
this
area,
which
is
--
states
vary
on
how
they
enter
judgments
after
the
jury
speaks
its
verdict.
so
where
do
we
draw
the
line
as
to
when
a
state
law
trumps
--
when
a
federal
law,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
--
trumps
a
state
system?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
other
than
trenching
on
state
rules
that
don't
create
the
constitutional
protection,
what's
wrong
with
a
simple
rule
that
says,
once
a
jury
announces
that
it
is
unanimous
on
acquittal
of
a
count,
you
can't
go
back
unless
the
jury
says
that
it's
not
unanimous
in
some
way?
what's
wrong
with
that
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
the
jury
comes
out
and
says,
we're
unanimous.
there
is
a
poll.
one
juror
says,
i'm
really
not
unanimous.
they
go
back.
but
once
a
jury
says
it's
unanimous,
a
judge
can't
declare
a
mistrial,
can't
do
something
until
it
ensures
itself
that
jeopardy
has
attached.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
asking
--
i'm
not
announcing
or
setting
a
rule
that
says
you
have
to
ask
them,
you
have
to
force
them
to
give
a
verdict.
i
mean,
i'm
saying,
what's
wrong
with
the
constitutional
rule
that
simply
says:
once
the
jury
says
we're
unanimous,
there
can't
be
manifest
injustice
--
there
can't
be
manifest
necessity
until
you're
sure
that
they
can't
reach
a
verdict
--
that
that
verdict
is
not
their
verdict.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
three
state
courts
have
said.
three
state
courts
have
said,
if
there
is
any
meaning
to
jeopardy,
it
is
that
once
a
jury
out
loud
says
to
a
defendant,
you're
not
guilty,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
rely
on
that.
so
what's
wrong
with
that
simple
rule?
