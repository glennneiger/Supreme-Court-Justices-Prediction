well,
at
this
point--
justice
elena
kagan
where
does
it
say
that
in
the
jury
charge?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
as
i
understand
what
the
arkansas
instructions
said,
what
the
instructions
in
this
case
said,
is
that
the
jury
unanimously
had
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt
on
an
offense
before
it
could
go
down
to
the
next
offense.
so
that's
to
say
that
the
jury
unanimously
had
to
find
what
is
--
what
leads
to
an
acquittal.
so
the
jury
had
to
unanimously
acquit
on
the
greater
offense
before
it
could
go
down
to
the
next.
and
the
instructions
don't
say
anything
about
moving
back
up.
and
this
jury
seems
to
take
its
responsibility
under
these
instructions
extraordinarily
seriously.
this
jury
was
instructing
the
judge
on
the
instructions
and
about
how
they
had
to
go
down
step
by
step
and
reach
unanimity
on
the
one
before
they
could
get
to
the
next
lowest
down,
so
i
guess
i'm
asking,
why
do
you
think
under
these
instructions
that
the
jury
felt
itself
able
to
go
back
up?
justice
elena
kagan
the
chief
prosecutor
kept
saying:
you
all
have
to
agree
on
this.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
if
you
look
at
what
the
court
--
the
judge
said,
what
the
prosecutor
said,
what
the
defense
counsel
said
and
then
what
the
jury
said,
it's
clear
that
they
all
thought
that
they
had
to
unanimously
agree
on
something
before
they
could
go
to
the
next
crime.
and,
again,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
what
anybody
said
that
they
could
go
back
up.
justice
elena
kagan
even
if,
general,
even
if
you're
not
required
--
and
if
you
are
required
--
but
even
if
you're
not,
here
the
jury
comes
back.
the
jury
tells
the
judge,
we've
unanimously
reached
acquittal
on
these
two
counts,
at
that
point
why
doesn't
the
judge
have
an
obligation
--
you
know,
the
judge
sends
them
back
for
a
half
hour.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
in
that
half
hour
they
moved
back
up
the
scale.
there
is
every
reason
to
think
they
just
remained
stuck
where
they
were.
but
even
assuming
that
there
is
some
conceivable
possibility
that
they
went
back
up,
why
doesn't
the
judge
working
with
the
manifest
necessity
standard
have
an
obligation
to
say,
well,
what
about
it?
did
you?
did
you
reach
acquittal?
did
you
reach
a
judgment
on
these
two
counts?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
--
general
mcdaniel,
one
question
about
what
arkansas
law
does
is
--
it
seems
a
little
bit
as
if
it's
trying
to
get
the
sweet
of
an
acquittal
for
a
state
without
the
bitter.
so
the
sweet
is
an
acquittal-first
system
where
you
force
a
jury
to
reach
agreement
on
one
thing
before
it
goes
to
the
next
thing,
makes
compromised
jury
verdicts
harder,
and
that's
why
a
state
might
say
we
want
an
acquittal-first
system.
the
bitter
that
most
states
take
with
that
is
that
they
say,
well,
if
we're
forcing
them
to
agree
on
these
things
and
they
agree
on
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
we're
stuck
with
that.
now,
what
arkansas
seems
to
run
is
a
system
in
which
it
forces
juries
to
agree
on
the
greater
charges
before
going
to
the
less,
but
won't
take
the
consequence
of
that,
which
is
that
sometimes
they
agree
that
on
the
greater
charges,
they're
not
guilty.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
you
mentioned
green
and
price
before,
and
those
are
the
cases,
of
course,
where
there
is
a
conviction
on
a
lesser
charge.
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
greater
charge.
and
then
the
conviction
is
overturned.
what
the
court
says
there
is,
well,
we
don't
know
anything,
but
we're
going
to
make
a
reasonable
assumption,
and
the
reasonable
--
no,
i
think
it
said
a
legitimate
assumption.
the
legitimate
assumption
that
they
acquitted
on
the
greater
charges
before
they
went
down
to
a
lesser
charge.
now,
it
seems
to
me
as
though
there
are
a
hundred
reasons
why
that
might
not
be
true.
the
jury
could
have
just
gone
to
the
lesser
charge
immediately
as
a
compromise
position
without
voting
on
the
greater
charge,
but
the
court
said,
well,
make
a
legitimate
assumption.
so
why
isn't
the
same
true
here?
we're
making
a
legitimate
assumption.
i
think,
honestly,
on
the
basis
of
much
more
than
green
and
price
had
to
work
with,
if
you
will,
that
the
jury,
in
fact,
acquitted
of
those
greater
offenses.
justice
elena
kagan
there
was
a
verdict
that
eventually
got
overturned.
there
was
no
verdict
on
the
greater
offenses.
