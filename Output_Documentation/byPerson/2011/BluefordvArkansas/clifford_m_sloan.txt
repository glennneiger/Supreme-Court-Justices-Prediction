mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
jury
foreperson's
announcement
that
the
jury
had
voted
unanimously
that
petitioner
was
not
guilty
of
capital
murder
and
first
degree
murder
has
double
jeopardy
consequences.
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
does,
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
foreperson's
announcement
on
this
record
establishes
an
acquittal;
and,
second,
even
if
it
is
not
viewed
as
an
acquittal,
under
this
court's
well
established
standard,
there
was
not
manifest
necessity
for
a
second
trial
on
the
same
murder
charges.
now,
with
regard
to
the
acquittal,
the
reasons
why
the
foreperson's
announcement
was
an
acquittal
are
twofold.
first,
the
foreperson's
announcement
was
clear
and
explicit
that
the
jury
had
voted
unanimously
against
guilt;
and,
second--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes,
your
honor.
and
then
the
court
specifically
asked,
what
is
the
count
on
capital
murder?
and
she
said,
unanimous
against
that.
what
is
the
count
on
first
degree
murder?
unanimous
against
that.
and
both
the
arkansas
trial
court
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
here
observed
that
the
foreperson
has
been
explicit
that
the
jury
had
voted
unanimously
against
guilt.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
with
--
with
regard
to
finality,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
that
the
jury
could
have
changed
its
mind,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
the
reason
i
say
that,
because
i
think
it
highlights
something
very
important
that
is
conspicuously
absent
here;
and
three
brief
points
on
that,
your
honor.
first,
when
the
foreperson
announced
that
the
jury
had
voted
unanimously
against
guilt
on
the
murder
charges,
she
was
announcing
a
jury
decision.
there
was
nothing
equivocal
or
qualified
about
that.
second,
your
honor--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
that
was
--
well,
that's
my
second--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes.
she
was
announcing
the
decision
that
they
had
made
at
that
point.
but
the
reason
--
my
second
point,
your
honor,
the
reason
why
i
say
that
they
could
have
gone
back
is
the
historic
traditional
principle
that
a
jury
can
correct
or
revise
a
verdict
while
it
continues
to
be
sitting.
now,
in
--
in
this
court's
opinion,
in
smith
v.
massachusetts,
this
court
talked
about
that
traditional
and
historic
principle,
cited
an
english
case
from
1824,
the
parkin
case,
where
the
jury
had
done
that,
had
gone
back
after
announcing
a
verdict.
and
how
that
would
play
out
here,
if
the
jury
came
back
and
they
said,
you
know,
we
were
unanimous
before,
but
now
one
juror
says
that
he
doesn't
really
agree
with
that,
then,
of
course,
a
court
could
take
that
into
account.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
because
the
--
the
reason
why
i
think
the
announcement
was
an
acquittal
here
is
twofold.
first,
there
was
the
explicit
statement
of
--
of
what
the
vote
was
at
that
time;
but,
second,
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
contradicts
that
statement.
at
the
time
the
jury
was
discharged
and
at
the
time
the
trial
ended,
the
jury
had
said
nothing
that
contradicted
that
earlier
statement.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--your
honor,
if
--
if
the
jurors
had
come
back
and
said--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
oh.
well,
in
terms
--
in
terms
of
arkansas
law
and
the
particular
transition
instructions
here,
no,
we
don't
think
the
transition
instructions
operate
that
way,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
instructions
that
say
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no.
it
--
it
does,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
between
how
the
transition
instructions
here
operate,
the
sort
of
acquittal
first
instructions,
and
the
general
principle
that
a
jury
can
correct
or
revise
its
verdict.
i
mean,
in
a
sense,
one
way
to
think
about--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--there
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
jury
statement
at
all
that
suggested
that
it
was
tentative.
it
said,
we
have
unanimously
voted
against
guilt
on
the
murder
charges.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
pardon
me?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
the
--
the
defense
counsel
asked
for
verdict
forms
to
be
sent
into
the
jury
room
that
would
allow
them
to
record
their
verdicts
on
the
murder
charges.
and
that's
a
very
important
point
here,
your
honor,
because
it
was
the
state
that
prevented
any
additional
elucidation
about
what
the
jury
thought
on
the
murder
charges.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
but,
your
honor,
on
the
record
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
what
you
have
is
this
very
clear
and
explicit
statement
against
guilt
on
the
murder
charges,
and
then
nothing
in
what
the
jury
says
when
it
comes
back
that
contradicts
that.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
because
the
jury
instructions
very
explicitly
said
that
you
don't
go
to
a
lesser
offense
unless
you
have
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
greater
offense.
the
state
over
and
over--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--i
was
just
going
to
say,
the
state
over
and
over
again
in
its
closing
argument
said
to
the
jury:
you
cannot
reach
a
lesser
offense
unless
you
unanimously
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
on
the
greater
offense.
and
as
you
point
out,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
in
the
hughes
case
has
said
that
the
law
in
arkansas
is
that
you
don't
get
to
a
lesser
offense
unless
the
--
the
jury
doesn't
get
to
a
lesser
offense
unless
it
in
essence
acquits
on
the
greater
offense.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
the
instructions
don't
provide
for
them
--
for
them
to
go
back.
the
state,
which
had
never
made
that
argument
until
this
court
in
its
litigation,
that
they
can
go
back,
doesn't
point
to
any
case
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
let
me
say,
whatever
one
thinks
about
finality,
and
do
i
think
there
was
sufficient
finality
here
for
the
reasons
we
have
been
discussing,
but
whatever
one
thinks
about
finality,
let's
consider
this
in
the
context
of
manifest
necessity.
because
whatever
one
thinks
of
finality,
i
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
when
a
jury
foreperson
stands
up
in
front
of
the
jury,
in
front
of
the
defendant,
lawyers
for
both
sides,
and
says:
we
have
voted
unanimously
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
these
murder
charges,
that
is
something
at
the
very
core
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
at
the
heartland
of
it.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
okay.
your
honor,
so
first
i'm
saying
only
that
there
was
no
manifest
necessity
as
to
capital
murder
and
first
degree
murder,
which
were
the
two
charges
on
which
they
were
unanimous.
we
agree
he
can
be
retried
on
manslaughter
and
negligent
homicide.
now,
as
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
decision
on
that,
and
that
brings
up
a
very
important
point,
because
the
state's
position
essentially
is
it
could
never
be
final
enough,
as
your
honor
suggests,
because
it
simply
is
impermissible
under
arkansas
law
to
have
an
acquittal
on
a
greater
offense
as
long
as
you're
deadlocked
on
the
lesser
offense.
and
as
to
that,
this
court's
opinions
are
clear
that
if
you
have
a
state
law
that
prevents
giving
effect
to
what
is
in
substance
an
acquittal,
it
must
yield
to
the
federal
constitutional
command
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
hudson
v.
louisiana
is
very
instructive
on
this
point,
because
in
hudson
louisiana
had
a
law
that
after
a
conviction
a
judge
could
not
enter
an
acquittal
order;
he
could
only
enter
a
new
trial
order.
and
after
the
conviction
on
murder
in
hudson,
the
judge
entered
a
new
trial
order
and
explained
that
it
was
because
of
insufficient
evidence.
and
this
court
unanimously
said
that
that
substantively
was
an
acquittal;
it
has
full
double
jeopardy
consequences,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
louisiana
law
does
not
allow
a
judge
to
enter
an
acquittal
order--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--okay,
your
honor.
two
points:
one
that
focuses
on
the
jury
foreperson's
announcement
here--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
disagree
that
it's
a
minor
matter
when
a
foreperson
stands
up,
with
the
jury
present,
and
says
we
have
voted
not
guilty.
and
as
to
that,
with
an
announcement
--
for
example,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
decision
in
the
roth
case,
which
is
in
the
brief,
is
instructive
because
in
that
case
the
massachusetts
court
said
very
emphatically,
you
should
not
ask
a
jury
that
kind
of
question.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
but
--
may
i
just
finish
the
sentence,
your
honor?
but
in
that
case,
the
trial
court
had
asked
the
jury,
and
the
foreperson
had
said
that
they
had
voted
against
guilt
on
the
greater
offenses.
and
so
the
massachusetts
court
said,
if
the
--
essentially,
these
are
my
words
--
but
if
the
double
jeopardy
clause
means
anything,
it
means
that
when
you
have
an
announcement
like
that,
it
has
to
matter.
and
the
other
point,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court's
opinions
such
as
fong
foo
and
sanabria
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
an
acquittal
is
on
an
erroneous
basis.
once
it
happens,
we
give
full
double
jeopardy
consequence
to
it.
so
even
if
one
thinks
that
the
judge
shouldn't
have
asked
the
question
and
it
would
have
been
permissible
not
to
ask
the
question,
once
he
did
and
once
that's
on
the
record,
that
is
of
considerable
constitutional--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
your
honor,
first,
on
the
manifest
necessity
point,
when
there
is
an
announcement
like
this,
because--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--the
--
the
manifest
necessity
argument
is
that
when
there
is
an
announcement
like
this
that
goes
right
to
the
core
of
double
jeopardy
--
and,
you
know,
we
know
that
with
greater
and
lesser
included
offenses,
if
there
is
a
basis
for
an
acquittal,
then
that
has
to
be
given
effect
on
the
separate
charges.
that's
green
and
price.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
because--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
your
honor,
on
the
manifest
necessity
point,
i'm
not
saying
you
can't
get
back.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
you
have
an
announcement
of
such
constitutional
moment
at
the
heartland
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
a
judge
can
do
many
things--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--because
this
court--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes,
your
honor.
because
this
court,
again
and
again,
has
talked
about
the
special
role
of
an
acquittal
where
a
jury
finds
the
defendant
not
guilty.
now,
even
if
one
views
that
as
not
final,
it
surely
is
significant
at
the
heartland
of
the
double
jeopardy--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--pardon?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
okay.
well,
your
honor.
if
one
assumes
the
foreperson's
announcement
is
not
--
or
it's
of
no
consequence--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--what
--
no,
no
--
it's
just
what
i'm
saying.
so
there's
just
the
question,
does
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
inquire?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
and
here--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--there's
--
i
would
say
definitely,
yes,
in
a
hard
transition
state.
this
is
where
you
get
into--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--right.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
he
does,
if--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes,
if
it
is
a
hard
transition
state.
and
--
or
especially
if
it's
a
hard
transition
state.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
okay.
what
a
hard
transition
or
sometimes
it's
called
an
acquittal
first
state,
which
may
put
it
in
relief
more,
which
is
where,
as
in
this
case,
the
jury
is
told,
you
may
go
to--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--and
every
state
court,
except
for
arkansas
here,
that
has
addressed
the
issue
in
the
context
of
a
hard
transition,
has
said
that
the
defendant
does
have
a
right
to
inquire--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
very
different
if
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
hard
transition.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
so
after
--
after
they
have
announced
an
acquittal?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
right.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
no;
i
--
look,
i
think
there
can
be
variations
in
state
procedure,
but
i
think
the
core--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
there
are
several
states
that
have
this,
and
the
reason--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
exactly
right.
there
is
another
body
of
case
law
also,
which
i
was
addressing,
which
talks
about
when
jeopardy
attaches
even
if
there
is
not
that
kind
of
announcement.
but,
your
honor--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes.
from
a
manifest
necessity
perspective,
this
court's
decisions
on
manifest
necessity
from
united
states
v.
perez
in
1824
through
renico
v.
lett
in
2010
have
emphasized
the
judge
has
to
exercise
sound
discretion.
and
to
exercise
sound
discretion
here,
the
judge
could
have
done
many
things,
but
the
one
thing
he
could
not
do
consistent
with
sound
discretion
is
to
do
nothing
and
to
proceed
as
though
that
announcement
hadn't
happened.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
in
the
face
of
a
jury
deadlock,
is
what
your
honor
is
talking
about.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
this
court
has
emphasized
the
--
the
deference
due
a
district
court.
but
renico--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--renico
did
not
present
the
important
threshold
issue
about
what
are
the
charges
on
which
the
jury
is
deadlocked.
and
here
there
is
an
insufficient
basis
to
conclude
that
the
jury
was
deadlocked
on
the
murder
charges.
there
was
nothing
like
the
foreperson's
announcement
at
issue
in
renico.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
your
honor,
there's
not
an
--
an
objection
at
that
time,
but
that
is
not
a
waiver
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
reached
the
merits.
it's
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
second,
before
that
point
defense
counsel
had
been
very
explicit
that
it
only
wanted
a
mistrial
on
the
--
on
the
remaining
counts
and
not
on
the
other
ones.
and,
third,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
the
distinction
in
manifest
necessity
is
when
the
defendant
affirmatively
consents
or
moves
for
a
mistrial,
as
opposed
to
either
if
the
judge
does
it
sua
sponte
and
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
object,
or
the
prosecutor
moves
for
it.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
core
of
the
state's
position
is
that
the
foreperson's
explicit
announcement
that
the
jury
had
unanimously
voted
against
guilt
is
of
no
constitutional
moment
whatsoever.
now,
there
is
no
opinion
of
this
court
that
has
ever
said
that
a
jury
statement
like
that
is
entitled
to
no
weight
whatsoever.
and
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
in
an
opinion,
it
would
open
the
door
to
many
of
the
core
double
jeopardy
evils
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
focused
on.
for
example,
acquittal
avoidance,
emphasized
in
the
arizona
v.
washington;
a
court
doesn't
want
to
accept
the
acquittal
consequences,
so
it
just
says,
we're
not
going
to
accept
that.
and
something
that's
a
very
real
and
practical
danger
here,
which
this
court
has
emphasized
over
and
over
again
in
opinions,
is
giving
the
state
the
opportunity
to
refine
and
hone
its
case
based
on
what
it
learned
at
the
first
trial
about
what
went
badly.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
it
was
vigorously
contested.
the
state's
capital
murder
and
murder
--
first-degree
murder
case
fell
apart.
their
lead
expert
on
it
was
destroyed.
the
jury
heard
both
sides,
voted
unanimously
not
guilty.
and
as
this
court
said
in
ashe
v.
swenson,
a
core
evil
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
that
we
don't
let
the
prosecutor
have
a
dry
run
at
a
first
trial,
and
then
get
to
go
before
a
second
trial
with
a
new
jury
and
plug
the
holes
in
it.
and
the
state's
position
here,
that
this
is
of
no
moment
at
all,
would
raise
that
danger
very
prominently.
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
the
jury
in
this
case
heard
the
evidence
on
both
sides,
unanimously
voted
against
guilt
on
the
murder
charges,
announced
that
in
open
court,
and
never
said
a
word
that
contradicted
it.
forcing
petitioner
to
run
the
gauntlet
a
second
time
on
the
murder
charges
would
run
counter
to
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
as
the
core
purposes,
policy
and
language
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor--
