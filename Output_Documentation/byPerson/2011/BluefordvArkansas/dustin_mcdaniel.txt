mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
key
reasons
why
jeopardy
has
not
terminated
in
this
case.
first,
the
jury
was
free
to
revisit
capital
and
first
degree
murder
when
it
resumed
its
deliberations.
thus--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--i
think
that
there
is
a
critical
misunderstanding
by
petitioner
of
arkansas's
jury
instructions,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
use
of
--
of
titles,
such
as
"acquittal
first",
or
"hard
transition"
or
"soft
transition".
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
well,
there
are
three
primary
reasons.
one,
in
states
that
are
acquittal-first
states,
states
that
truly
require
a
resolution
of
each
charge
before
the
transition
to
subsequent
charges,
they
use
words
like
"unanimous".
in
fact
they
all
use
the
word
"unanimous"
in
their
instruction.
arkansas
doesn't
do
that.
we
use
a
rather
ambiguous
or
unambiguous,
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--and
he
was
accurate,
and
he
was
echoed
by
the
defense
counsel
in
her
closing
argument
as
well.
but
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
resolution.
the
jury
verdict
forms
reflect
that
perfectly.
in
fact,
justice
breyer's
example
of
a
given
state
is
exactly
what
arkansas
does,
as
compared
to
a
true
acquittal
first
state,
where
there
are
multiple
jury
verdict
forms,
where
you
truly
resolve
one
charge
attaching
final
resolution
and
in
fact
attaching
jeopardy
or
terminating
jeopardy
at
that
point.
in
this
case
there
is
one
verdict
form.
you
can
decide--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--i
did.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
that
hughes
is
extraordinarily
important.
and,
respectfully,
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
has
mischaracterized
hughes.
there
is
a
line
of
dicta
in
hughes
that
is
particularly
useful
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
but
it
is
justice
corbin
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
who
authored
hughes,
who
was
rejecting
a
double
jeopardy
claim
in
hughes,
and
in
fact
invoked
this
line
which
says
--
what
has
been
quoted
in
the
briefs
--
is
justice
corbin
who
was
presented
with
this
exact
same
argument
to
interpret
the
instructions
in
blueford
and
authored
blueford
and
rejected
what
allegedly
was
his
position
on
the
instructions.
hughes
was
not
about
the
instructions.
no
part
of
hughes
was
asked
to
interpret
what
our
instructions
are.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
that
is
extraordinarily
important.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
the
state
would
assert
that
that
is
precisely
the
case
here.
you
have
exactly
the
type
of
jury
verdict
form
that
justice
breyer
suggested
in
his
example.
they
have
to
decide
on
something.
you
have
one
charge,
capital
murder
and
its
lesser
and
included's.
this
person,
mr.
blueford,
does
not
deny
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
homicide
offense,
that
was
included
in
their
closing
argument;
does
not
deny
that
he's
subject
to
retrial
because
there
was
manifest
necessity
on
at
least
two
of
the
charges.
they
simply
would
like
to
say
that
there
was
not
manifest
necessity
for
the
greater
of
the
two.
and
the
only
way
that
that
happens
is
either
--
to
answer,
i
believe
it
was
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
earlier
--
are
you
required
to
go
in
and
engage
in
partial
verdicts
even
if
the
state
does
not
choose
to
do
so,
even
if
the
state
is
in
fact
a
general
verdict
state?
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons.
one,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
state
recognizes
it
was
improper
for
the
judge
to
inquire
in
the
way
that
he
did.
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
he
recognized
that
it
was
improper,
as
he
didn't
do
it
on
their
first
announcement
of
deadlock
and
he
didn't
do
it
on
their
final
announcement
of
deadlock.
it's
important
to
note
that,
although
defense
counsel
at
trial
did
ask
for
revised
verdict
forms,
that
was
not
her
initial
reaction.
her
initial
reaction
was
to
say,
judge,
i
think
that
the
jury
needs
to
go
back
and
keep
deliberating
and
i
would
ask
that
you
give
them
another
allen
charge.
that's
not
the
reaction
that
anyone
would
have
if
they
had
just
heard
an
acquittal
of
their
client.
this
was
in
fact
a
mid
deliberation
report,
probably
wrongfully
elicited
by
the
trial
judge,
but
it
was
just
that,
a
snapshot
in
time
with
no
intent
by
the
jury
to
make
an
announcement.
so,
when
they
returned,
the
real
question,
i
think,
hinges
as
this
court
analyzed
in
smith
versus
massachusetts
is,
is
it
possible
for
there
to
be
revision.
and
it
doesn't
in
fact,
justice
kagan,
have
to
be
the
entirety
of
the
jury
completely
pivoting
in
their
decisions.
all
it
would
have
to
be
is
one.
and
we
recognize
that,
even
after
they
have
announced
unanimously,
signed
the
verdict
form,
offered
their
assent,
if
they
are
polled
in
the
box
and
one
person
changes
their
vote,
then
that
bears
the
effect
of
changing
the
verdict.
so
is
it
possible--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--certainly
there
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
tougher
case
if
everything
ended
at
that
moment.
because
at
that
point,
counsel
would
have
to
ask
the
trial
court,
if
you're
declaring
a
mistrial
at
this
moment
on
this
report,
what
are
you
going
to
do?
are
you
going
to
accept
this
or
are
you
not
going
to
accept
it?
will
there
be
an
opportunity
for
polling?
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
and,
justice
sotomayor,
they
were
rightly
rejected.
partial
verdicts
are
not
contemplated
in
arkansas
law.
it
would
have
been
error
for
him
to
engage
in
partial
verdicts
at
that
time.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
fifth
amendment
that
would
require
this
court
to
intrude
upon
the
liberty
of
the
states
to
determine
whether
they're
general--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--if
there
is
a
hung
jury
as
to
all
counts--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--correct.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
no.
if
there's
manifest
necessity
for
a
mistrial,
and
in
this
case
there
is
one
charge,
one
homicide
offense,
and
as
this
court
has
long
recognized,
brown
versus
ohio
being
a
key
analysis--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--respectfully,
justice
sotomayor,
they
were
not
told
acquit
first.
that
is
a
subtle
but
key
distinction.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
i
absolutely
do
not.
it
was
not
a
verdict.
and
though
there's
no--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--well,
it's
not
up
to
the
jury
to
determine--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--that
is
correct,
justice
breyer.
that
is
correct.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
no,
justice
kagan.
the
majority
of
the
states
and
circuits
recognize
there
is
a
difference
between
a
hard
transition
instruction
and
an
acquittal-first
instruction.
they
recognize
the
difference
between
a
partial
verdict
and
a
general
verdict
on
charges
that
include
lesser
and
includeds.
and
what
we
require
is
one
verdict
on
a
charge:
guilty
or
not
guilty.
and
they
are
at
liberty
to
consider
--
they
can
be
at
the
very
end
--
again,
it's
very
important
to
know
--
it's
wholly
speculative
in
this
case
to
know
where
they
were
when
they
ultimately
were
hung,
and
so
we
are
--
we
are
operating
in
the
world
of
brightline
rules,
which
are
very
important
for
jeopardy.
we
know
when
jeopardy
attaches.
when
the
jury
is
in
the
box.
we
know
when
jury
--
or
when
jeopardy
terminates,
and
it's
when
there's
some
conclusion
with
finality.
every
case
that
this
court
has
analyzed,
even
price,
green
and
sylvester,
where
the
jury
remained
silent,
there
was
some
finality
that
led
to
a
determination
of
jeopardy.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
the
state
wouldn't
venture
to
speculate
as
to
what
they
did,
although
i
would
respectfully
say
that
that
is
probably
what
happened.
they
went
back
and
they
tried
to
follow
the
instructions
of
the
court.
that's
certainly
viewing
things
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner,
and
there's
no
evidence--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--it
does.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
it
--
it
bears
all
the
difference
in
the
finality
of
the
verdict.
and,
again,
as
this
court
noted
in
smith,
it's
the
availability;
it's
the
incorporation
within
a
state's
procedure
for
that
finality
to
be
undone.
my
lord,
how
likely
is
it
truly
for
a
trial
court
to
completely
reverse
his
or
her
granting
of
a
motion
of
dismissal,
but
this
court
said,
if
there
is
a
procedure
in
place
for
it
to
be
revisited,
then
jeopardy
doesn't
terminate
until
the
point
at
which
there's
no
return.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
that's
correct.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
yes,
justice
alito,
that's
precisely
correct.
just
as
justice
scalia
noted
earlier,
we
recognize
that
there
are
compromises
that
are
incorporated
into
transitions.
one
may
be
willing
to
say
i'm
willing
to
move
on
from
first
degree
murder;
i'm
the
only
one
here
that
believes
that
we
should
find
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
but
that's
not
going
to
happen.
i'm
not
going
to
change
your
votes.
but
i'm
willing
to
move
on
and
go
to
manslaughter.
but
would
that
vote
equate
to
an
acquittal
if
asked
in
--
with
finality?
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
i
think
what
arkansas
law
actually
says
is
how
we
should
be
judged,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
evidence
here
was
that
the
jury
came
in
to
answer
questions
about
the
status
of
their
deliberation.
i
think
that
justice
kagan
properly
noted
that
they
were
in
fact
giving
the
judge
some
instructions
on
how
the
instructions
should
work.
and
they
were
answering
that
question,
and
the
foreperson
--
one
person
was
asked,
well,
where
are
you,
and
she
announces
--
and
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
she
was
not
being
truthful.
at
the
same
time,
we
have
no
way
to
verify
it.
and
the
defense
counsel
said,
judge,
i
think
they
ought
to
be
given
another
allen
charge,
and
they
need
to
go
keep
deliberating.
and
at
that
point,
if
they
had
returned
--
no
matter
how
unlikely
--
if
they'd
come
back
in
10
minutes
later
and
said,
we
find
unanimously
guilty
of
capital
murder,
no
matter
how
unlikely,
if
that
was
possible,
then
jeopardy
could
not
have
terminated
upon
that
report.
it
could
not
have
been
an
acquittal,
because
they
couldn't
have
continued
deliberating
on
those
charges
for
another
instant.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
i
think
that
ball
is
particularly
helpful
to
us,
and
i
think
that
the
hudson
case
cited
by
petitioner
is
also
important.
if
--
if
a
state
puts
a
procedural
bar
to
considering
a
final
judgment
of
acquittal,
then
that
procedural
bar
is
trumped
by
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
ball
was--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
your
answer
is
contained
within
the
question.
a
verdict
is
the
true
answer.
if
there
is
a
verdict,
then
the
--
the
force
and
impact
of
that
verdict
is
what
matters.
did
this
jury
announce
a
verdict?
if
so,
jeopardy
attached.
but
this
was
not
a
verdict.
it
bore
none
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
verdict.
it
wasn't
published.
it
wasn't
verified.
it
wasn't
accepted
by
the
court.
it
wasn't
even
accepted
by
the
defendant's
attorney.
it
wasn't
a
verdict.
in
ball,
there
was
a
clear
verdict.
the
jury
announced
acquittal.
the
judge
entered
acquittal.
and
later,
the
indictment
was
dismissed
as
being
faulty.
and
under
the
law
of
england
up
until
that
time
--
even
in
the
united
states
--
a
faulty
indictment
dismisses
everything
and
you
start
de
novo.
so
even
the
acquittal
gets
thrown
out
because
you
can't
acquit
of
something
that
was
void
ab
initio.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
some
states
do,
in
fact,
give
the
opportunity
to
inquire
into
the
jury's
deliberations.
partial
verdict
forms
and
inquiries
are
permitted.
but
they
are
not
required.
and
in
arkansas,
the
state
properly
objected
to
changing
the
agreed
upon
verdict
forms
as
the
judge
said
midstream.
they
had
been
agreed
to,
they
had
been
submitted,
and
they
properly
reflected
the
law
in
arkansas.
so
have
to
change
them
would
have
either
been
by
agreement
or
because
they
were
constitutionally
required.
and
that's
ultimately
the
case
--
the
question
in
front
of
this
court.
are
they
ult
--
are
they
constitutionally
required.
and
that
leads
into
the
manifest
necessity
analysis
because
anytime
there
is
a
charge
with
lesser
and
included
offenses
and
a
general
verdict
state,
and
the
jury
simply
announces,
we
cannot
reach
a
determination,
is
--
is
the
constitutional
trigger
truly
resting
on
the
fortuity
of
the
announcement
of
a
snapshot
vote
in
open
court,
or
is
a
constitutional
trigger
how
they
voted
back
in
the
jury
room?
and
if
that
is
the
constitutional
trigger,
then
wouldn't
verdict
--
partial
verdicts
be
required.
in
fact,
this
court
does
not
require
partial
verdicts.
an
announcement
of
unable
to
render
a
verdict
warrants
a
mistrial.
this
court
has
said
clearly
in
renico
that
we
defer
to
a
trial
court's
decision
that
manifest
necessity
exists.
in
fact,
this
court
has
never
overturned
a
trial
court's
decision
that
manifest
necessity
existed
for
the
--
on
a
hung
jury.
here
a
jury
was
hung.
they
simply
could
not
render
a
decision
on
the
verdict
forms
they
were
submitted:
guilty
or
not
guilty
of
a
homicide.
they
couldn't
answer
the
question.
and,
therefore,
jeopardy
should
continue
and
the
retrial
should
be
permitted.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
well,
in
green
and
price
there
were
verdicts,
and
in
this
case
there's
no
verdict.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
you
have
to
look
at
green
and
price
in
conjunction
with
this
court's
holding
in
brown
in
the
analysis
of
lesser
included
offenses
within
a
general
offense.
they
are
one
for
jeopardy
purposes.
in
this
case,
mr.
blueford
was
facing
one
charge
for
jeopardy
purposes.
the
information,
the
indictment,
only
included
one
charge.
so
he
could
not
have
been
convicted
of
both
manslaughter
and
murder
in
the
first
degree.
this
court's
very
clear
about
that.
so
in
green
and
in
price,
where
there
was
a
conviction
on
a
lesser
charge
and
silence,
in
other
words,
they
didn't
expressly
say:
not
guilty
of
this
higher
charge,
and
not
guilty
of
this
higher
charge,
and
guilty
of
this
lesser
charge,
it
stands
only
to
reason,
and
certainly
to
constitutional
scrutiny,
you
can
only
be
convicted
of
one
of
them.
and
if
the
jury
finds
--
and,
again,
it
still
requires
publication,
verification
and
acceptance
by
a
court
--
of
an
actual
verdict
of
one
of
those
charges,
it
only
stands
to
reason
and
logic
that
the
upper
charges
were
dismissed.
that
is
entirely
different,
respectfully,
from
this
case.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
well,
and
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
question
here
as
to,
is
it
an
implied
acquittal
or
was
it
an
express
verdict?
i
think
the
petitioner
can't
really
decide,
or
at
least
hasn't
articulated,
where
the
jeopardy
terminating
event
occurred.
was
it
when
they
made
their
announcement?
in
which
case,
why
did
they
go
and
subsequently
deliberate
even
on
the
request
of
counsel?
was
it
at
the
conclusion
when
there
was
the
possibility
that
nothing
really
had
changed
after
the
report
and
a
declaration
of
manifest
necessity,
which
did
not
come,
by
the
way,
at
the
request
of
the
state.
it
was
sui
sponte
by
the
court.
and
then
there
was,
in
fact,
a
waiver,
and
i
think
a
legitimate
waiver,
of
an
objection
by
defense
counsel.
there
was
--
at
no
time
at
that
point
before
releasing
this
jury
did
defense
counsel
renew
a
motion
to
submit
partial
verdict
forms,
to
inquire
into
the
jury,
to
poll
where
they
were--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--the
primary
difference
would
be
in
fact
the
possibility
that
polling
may
be
different
after
another
half
hour
of
deliberations.
all
it
takes
is
one
juror
to
change
their
mind.
and
in
fact
it
may
have
benefit
the
defendant.
what
if
they
had
already
decided
they'd
changed
their
mind
again
and
acquitted
on
manslaughter
and
then
moved
down
to
negligent
homicide?
and
that's
what
they
were
talking
about.
where
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
final
30
minutes
of
deliberation
is
purely
speculative.
and
because
it's
purely
speculative,
regardless
of
whether
it
could
benefit
the
state
or
the
defendant,
it
means
that
no
report
was
a
verdict.
no
report
could
have
been
a
verdict.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
it
would
be
difficult
to
apply
in
practicality,
and
it
certainly
would
be--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--the
primary
reason
why
the
majority
of
jurisdictions
have
rejected
that
analysis,
whether
it's
announced
or
not,
is
the
coercive
effect
on
a
jury.
if
you
have
a
tired,
frustrated,
potentially
angry
jury,
and
they
are
told,
we're
either
going
to
let
you
go
or
you're
--
we're
not
going
to
let
you
go
home
until
you
decide
something,
you
have
to
tell
us
something.
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
so
we're
not
asking,
but
if
--
just
so
i
understand
your
hypothetical
--
we're
not
asking
them,
but
if
for
fortuitously
they
happen
to
announce,
spontaneously
or
otherwise--
mr.
dustin
mcdaniel
--first,
this
court
hasn't
--
that
court
--
that
rule
--
could
be
allowed
to
work
and,
in
fact,
it
does
work
in
some
states.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
benefit
mr.
blueford,
and
so
i
don't
see
how
it
follows
into
his
relief
because
it
didn't
in
fact
happen.
and
so
it
takes
us
--
it
might
be
beneficial
to
future
defendants
if
they
ever
find
themselves
in
such
a
circumstance,
but
it
doesn't
apply
retroactively.
