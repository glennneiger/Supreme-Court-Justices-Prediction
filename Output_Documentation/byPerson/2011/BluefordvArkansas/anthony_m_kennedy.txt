justice
anthony
m.

suppose
--
suppose
the
court
said,
after
this
colloquy,
i
want
you
to
go
back
and
think
about
this
whole
case
again.
could
the
jurors
then
have
revisited
the
first
count--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
capital
murder
count?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
the
colloquy
is
what
we've
got.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
judge
said
i
want
you
to
deliberate
more
about
this
entire
case.
a,
was
he
permitted
to
do
that
under
arkansas
law,
i
guess
is
one
of
my
real
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
nothing
--
nothing
--
arkansas
law
doesn't
permit
the
jury
to
--
before
it's
delivered
its
final
formal
verdict,
to
think
about
the
case
again
and
vote
on
it
again?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
--
i
think
this
may
be
what
justice
alito
asked.
i
don't
think
it
gave
a
verdict
here.
i
don't
think
it's
revising
its
verdict.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
mid-deliberation,
as
justice
--
as
justice
scalia
said
at
the
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
i'm
not
sure
it's
just
a
matter
of
state
law
then.
we're
--
he's
talking
about
the
constitutional
minimum,
and
i
--
i
--
justice
scalia
gave
a
hypothetical,
you
can
have
a
more
--
even
a
more
principled
juror
than
that.
he
says:
you
know,
now
that
we're
thinking
about
manslaughter,
it
is
true
that
thus
and
so
happened,
maybe
we
were
wrong
on
the
first
--
first
degree
count.
i
mean,
that's
perfectly
plausible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
--
but
that's
after
a
verdict.
why
is
it
that
the
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
are
implicated
when
a
jury,
before
it
delivers
a
final
verdict,
says
where
--
where
it
is
mid
--
mid-deliberations?
the
defendant
of
course
is
terribly
disappointed
if
they
go
back
and
then
find
him
guilty,
so
i
guess
there
is
a
personal
disappointment
interest
for
the
few
hours
that
it
takes
for
the
jury
to
come
to
a
different
verdict.
but
he
doesn't
have
to
prepare
the
defense
again;
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
trial
again.
it's
all
one
trial.
i
don't
see
why
there
is
a
double
jeopardy
interest
in
the
massachusetts
case
that
you
point
out.
i
don't
see
where
the
double
jeopardy
interest
was
in
saying
that
you
can't
go
back.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
implicated
by
the
rule
that
says
you
can't
go
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
why
it's
the
heartland
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
question
that.
