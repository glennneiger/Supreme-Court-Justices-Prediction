justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
bothering
me
is
i
can't
figure
this
out
very
well.
we
have
an
imaginary
state,
and
what
the
state
says
to
the
jury:
jury,
you
have
three
choices.
choice
one
is
you
acquit
this
person
of
everything.
choice
two
is
you
convict
him
of
something.
choice
three
is
you
say
you're
hung.
okay?
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
a
state
from
doing
that.
so
if
that
--
if
no
--
what
is
it?
and,
of
course,
if
you
follow
that,
there
was
no
acquittal
on
those
early
charges.
that
wasn't
a
permissible
verdict.
and
now
you
structure
your
argument
in
any
way
you
want,
but
that
the
state
has,
i
would
think,
within
the
limits
of
due
process,
it
can
structure
the
jury's
arguments
as
it
wishes.
but
--
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
and
if
that
--
if
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
then
how
do
you
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
could
say,
well,
could
say
--
well,
that's
one
route.
what
you
say
is,
nothing
wrong
with
that.
but
if
the
judge
is
foolish
enough
to
get
the
jury
--
to
get
the
foreperson
to
say
what
the
state
of
the
deliberation
is
in
detail,
then
the
double
jeopardy
clause
kicks
in.
well,
that's
an
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
make
a
mistake
and
now
suddenly
there's
jeopardy,
where
it
wasn't
before,
or
--
this
seems
like
a
minor
matter
compared
to
the
issues
of
jeopardy,
whether
the
jury
honestly
said
what
was
going
on
in
the
room,
particularly
if
it's
changeable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
let's
--
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
"surely"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
why?
look,
the
thing
ends.
to
go
back
to
my
example,
the
case
is
over,
the
jury
comes
in
and
says,
judge,
we're
hung.
okay?
everybody
is
going
to
go
home.
but
the
defense
lawyer
says,
judge,
i'd
like
to
know
which
of
the
five
charges
they
are
on.
does
the
defense
lawyer
or
the
prosecutor
have
a
constitutional
right
to
find
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
assuming
anything.
i
gave
you
the
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
state
i
imagine
is
--
remember,
there
were
three
possible
verdicts
--
acquit
of
everything,
convict
of
something,
or
say
you're
hung.
that's
what
we're
imagining.
okay?
and
you
can
imagine
the
set
of
instructions
go
to
a,
b,
c;
that's
fair
enough.
those
four
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
now,
case
over,
acquitted
--
no,
hung,
your
honor.
defense
attorney:
i
want
to
find
out
which
of
the
five
they
are
on.
does
he
have
a
constitutional
right
to
get
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
does?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
see,
okay,
fine.
in
other
words,
here
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
only
midway,
because
i'm
trying
to
follow
this
through.
i
still
don't
know
why
the
constitution
does
that,
but
i'll
take
your
word
for
it.
i
would
assume
it
was
state
law
that
does
that,
but
--
but
fine.
but
now
he
says,
yes,
you
have
the
right,
either
of
you
has
the
right.
we're
on
number
three.
your
honor,
i
would
like
a
poll
of
the
jury
as
to
the
acquittal
as
to
one
and
two.
does
both
--
do
both
sides
have
the
right
to
get
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
here's
what
happened:
"judge,
i
want
to
know
what
number
they
were
on
when
they
couldn't
reach.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
foreman:
"number
five,
your
honor".
"judge,
i
would
like
a
poll
of
the
jury,
each
juror,
as
to
numbers
one,
two,
three
and
four
to
be
sure
that
they
were
unanimous
on
each
as
to
the
acquittal,
which
under
the
instruction
allowed
them
to
go
to
the
next
one.
"
okay?
constitution
requires
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
why
doesn't
the
constitution
require
it?
you
have
to
be
sure
there
was
an
acquittal.
what
--
what
i'm
doing
obviously
is
i'm
spinning
out
what
i
see
as
the
constitutional
consequences
of
taking
your
constitutional
position,
and
i'm
going
to
be
ending
up
by
saying,
i've
never
heard
of
this
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
a
lot
of
stuff
i
haven't
heard
of,
so
that
doesn't
prove
that
much.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
room
in
arkansas
law
for
saying
you're
acquitted
as
to
one,
acquitted
as
to
two.
but
arkansas
law
says
you
come
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
something,
a
verdict
of
acquittal
of
everything,
or
the
words
"hung
jury".
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
they
say
to
the
judge,
judge,
we
are
hung.
judge
says,
hung
jury.
