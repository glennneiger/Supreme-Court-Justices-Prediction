justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
--
is
that
altogether
clear,
because
she
first
said
--
didn't
she
first
say
that
the
jury
cannot
agree
on
any
one
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
they
went
out
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
the
problem.
they
--
the
jury
--
the
judge
gave
them
an
allen
charge,
and
they
went
out
again.
and
i
think
you
have
recognized
that
the
jury
could
have
then
said:
we'll
go
back
to
square
one,
we'll
consider
capital
murder,
first
degree
murder.
so
they
--
i
think
you
recognize
that
after
the
judge
gives
them
a
charge
of
this
kind,
they
can
begin
all
over
again.
and
here,
when
they
came
in
and
said,
we
--
we
can't
agree,
defense
counsel
didn't
ask
to
have
the
jury
polled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
mcdaniel,
in
this
case,
they
deliberated
for
4-1/2
hours
at
the
point
where
the
judge
asked
them,
where
do
you
stand
on
this
count?
where
do
you
stand?
and
so
they
were
up
to
the
manslaughter
and
they
were
stuck
on
that.
and
the
jury
foreman
said,
we
can't
go
to
negligent
homicide
because
we
haven't
reached
agreement
on
the
manslaughter
charge.
then
they
go
back
for
just
a
half
hour.
how
realistic
is
it
to
think
that
they
began
over
at
that
point
rather
than
trying
to
resolve
the
manslaughter
charge
so
they
could
do
exactly
what
the
judge
told
them,
and
then
get
to
the
negligent
homicide
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sloan
told
us
that
it
was
the
state
that
prevented
the
elucidation,
because
defense
counsel
said,
judge,
we
can
try
to
do
what
double
jeopardy
clause
says,
not
try
a
person
twice
for
the
same
offense.
so,
judge,
please
ask
the
jury
to
rule
on
those
two
--
give
them
a
sheet
that
gives
them
a
choice
of
guilty
or
not
guilty,
but
they
went
--
that
originally
was
just
a
series
of
guilty
on
the
four
counts,
and
then
their
other
choice
was
acquittal.
now,
defense
counsel
says,
ask
them,
is
it
guilty
or
not
guilty
instead
of
asking
just
is
it
guilty.
and
the
judge
declines
to
do
that.
isn't
that
why
we
don't
have
definitive
answers?
because
defense
counsel
says
--
said,
judge,
give
the
jury
the
chance
to
tell
us
whether
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
if
she
had
asked,
so
why
was
it
necessary
for
her
to
repeat
it?
she
said:
judge,
please
let
them
vote
yes
or
no
on
the
two
most
serious
charges.
and
the
judge
said,
no.
she
might
have
figured
if
she
was
going
to
repeat
that
she
would
just
annoy
the
judge.
she
had
made
the
--
she
had
made
the
request.
