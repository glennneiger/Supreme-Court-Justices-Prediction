hear
argument
next
in
case
10-1320,
blueford
v.
arkansas.
mr.
sloan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
but
that's
the
final
say.
you
don't
know
what
the
jury
did
as
a
preliminary
matter.
i
would
think
in
a
case
like
this
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
jury
to
say:
let's
take
a
preliminary
vote;
we'll
go
down;
and
if
we
all
agree
on
something
right
away,
that's
what
we'll
do.
does
everybody
agree
on
capital
murder?
no,
some
don't.
does
everybody
agree
on
murder?
no.
does
everybody
agree
on
manslaughter?
yes.
okay,
we
all
know
that
manslaughter,
he's
at
least
guilty.
now
let's
go
back
and
talk
about
the
more
serious
offense,
and
some
of
us
will
try
to
persuade
the
holdouts.
and
yet
you
would
say
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
point
of
saying
yes,
he's
guilty
on
manslaughter,
they
can't
go
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
talked
about
our
manifest
necessity
decisions.
it's
true
that
we
--
isn't
it,
that
we
said
last
year
we
have
never
reversed
the
district
court's
exercise
of
discretion
under
the
manifest
necessity
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
under
that
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
--
i'm
sorry
for
taking
up
your
time,
but
your
friend
says
you
did
not
object
when
the
judge
announced
that
he
was
going
to
declare
a
mistrial;
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
mcdaniel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
sloan,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,--
mr.
sloan,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1320,
blueford
versus
arkansas.
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
as
a
general
matter,
prohibits
trying
someone
twice
for
the
same
offense.
it
has
long
been
established,
however,
that
a
person
maybe
tried
again
if
the
jury
could
not
agree
on
a
verdict
at
his
first
trial.
if
a
jury
cannot
reach
a
verdict,
the
judge
declares
what
is
known
as
a
mistrial
and
the
prosecution
gets
to
decide
whether
to
retry
the
defendant.
now,
in
this
case
the
state
of
arkansas
charged
petitioner,
alex
blueford,
with
capital
murder
for
the
death
of
one-year-old
child.
that
charge
included
the
lesser
offenses
of
first-degree
murder,
manslaughter,
and
negligent
homicide.
in
other
words,
the
jury
could
convict
blueford
of
anyone
of
those
offenses
depending
on
its
view
of
the
evidence
and
whether
it
thought
the
prosecution
had
carried
its
burden
of
proof
on
the
particular
elements
that
went
with
each
offense.
at
trial,
the
court
instructed
the
jury,
when
deliberating,
to
consider
the
offenses
in
order,
from
greater
to
lesser.
thus,
the
jury
was
told
to
begin
with
capital
murder
then
if
the
jury
had
a
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
blueford
was
guilty
of
capital
murder,
to
go
on
to
first-degree
murder.
next,
if
the
jury
had
a
reasonable
doubt
on
first-degree
murder
to
go
on
to
manslaughter,
and
so
on.
the
court
also
presented
the
jury
with
a
set
of
verdict
forms
which
allowed
the
jury
either
to
convict
blueford
of
one
of
the
charged
offenses
or
to
acquit
him
of
all
of
them.
acquitting
on
some,
but
not
others
was
not
an
option.
after
deliberating
for
a
few
hours,
the
jury
reported
that
it
could
not
reach
a
verdict.
the
court
inquired
about
the
jury's
progress
on
each
offense.
the
foreperson
said
that
the
jury
was
unanimous
against
guilt
on
the
charges
of
capital
murder
and
first-degree
murder,
was
deadlocked
on
manslaughter,
and
had
not
voted
on
negligent
homicide.
the
court
told
the
jury
to
continue
to
deliberate.
the
jury
did
so
but
still
could
not
reach
a
verdict
and
the
court
declared
a
mistrial.
the
state
subsequently
sought
to
retry
blueford.
everybody
agrees
that
he
may
be
retried
on
charges
of
manslaughter
and
negligent
homicide.
the
question
is
whether
he
may
also
be
retried
on
charges
of
capital
and
first-degree
murder.
blueford
says
he
can't
be,
because
the
foreperson's
report
that
the
jury
was
unanimous
against
guilt
on
capital
and
first-degree
murder
represented
an
acquittal
on
those
charges.
that
report,
however,
was
not
a
final
resolution
of
anything.
when
the
foreperson
told
the
court
how
the
jury
had
voted
on
each
offense,
the
jury's
deliberations
had
not
yet
concluded.
the
jurors
in
fact
went
back
to
the
jury
room
to
deliberate
further
and
nothing
in
the
court's
instructions
prohibited
them
from
reconsidering
their
earlier
votes
as
deliberations
continued.
the
foreperson's
report
prior
to
the
end
of
deliberations,
therefore,
lacked
the
finality
necessary
to
amount
to
an
acquittal
on
capital
and
first-degree
murder.
blueford's
other
reason
for
why
he
can't
be
retried
is
that
the
trial
court's
declaration
of
a
mistrial
was
improper.
blueford
contends
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
a
mistrial
on
capital
and
first-degree
murder
given
that
the
foreperson's
report
that
the
jury
had
voted
unanimously
against
guilt
on
those
charges
meant
that
he
had
been
acquitted
on
them.
at
that
--
according
to
blueford
at
that
time,
the
court
should
have
allowed
the
jury
to
give
effect
to
those
votes
and
then
considered
a
mistrial
only
as
to
the
remaining
charges.
but
as
permitted
under
arkansas
law,
the
jury's
options
in
this
case
were
limited
to
two,
either
convict
on
one
of
the
offenses
or
acquit
on
all.
the
jury
in
this
case
was
unable
to
do
either
and
the
trial
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
by
refusing
to
add
another
option,
that
of
acquitting
on
some
offenses
but
not
others.
the
jury
in
this
case
did
not
convict
blueford
of
any
offense,
but
it
did
not
acquit
him
of
any
either.
when
the
jury
was
unable
to
return
a
verdict,
the
trial
court
properly
declared
a
mistrial
and
discharged
the
jury.
as
a
consequence,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
stand
in
the
way
of
a
second
trial
on
the
same
offenses.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
is
affirmed.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
kagan
join.
