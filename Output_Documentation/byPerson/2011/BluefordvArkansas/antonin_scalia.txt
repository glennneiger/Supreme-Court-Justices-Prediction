well,
that's
the
count.
a
jury
takes
lots
of
votes.
was
it
utterly
clear
that
the
jury
could
not
go
back
and
reconsider
that?
unless
that
was
absolutely
clear,
it
seems
to
me
a
verdict
had
not
been
announced.
she
just
said
how
we
voted
the
last
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
when
you
say
she
was
announcing
a
decision,
then
you
mean
they
can't
go
back
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
she
was
announcing
a
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
--
so
long
as
it's
still
tentative
thoughts,
it
doesn't
matter.
the
jury
could
have
--
suppose
the
jury
went
back
after
this
announcement,
yes,
you
know,
we've
decided
on
the
greater
charge
or
we
voted
on
the
greater
charge
for
the
defendant,
suppose
they
go
back
and
one
of
the
people
who
wants
to
convict
on
the
lesser
charge,
as
to
which
they
are
deadlocked,
finally
says,
well,
look
it,
if
you
won't
come
along
to
convict
him
on
the
lesser
charge,
by
god,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
going
to
acquit
on
the
greater
charge.
isn't
that
the
kind
of
stuff
that
goes
on
in
jury
rooms
all
the
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
no
certainty
whatever
that
--
that
what
was
the
vote
at
that
time
would
be
the
vote
when
they
finally
got
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
--
only
if,
and
i
think
this
is
the
premise
of
your
argument,
only
if
there
is
a
constitutional
necessity
to,
to
sever
the
various
charges,
there
is
a
constitutional
necessity
to
let
the
jury
come
in
on
one
charge
without
coming
in
on
the
other.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
premise
of
your
argument.
and
i
don't
know
where
that
constitutional
necessity
comes
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
manifest
necessity
depends
upon
the
necessity
of
severing,
yes,
if
you
sever
then
there
is
no
manifest
necessity
of
resubmitting
the
greater
charge.
but
it
assumes
--
it
assumes
a
severing,
and
i
don't
know
where
the
severing
comes
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
finish
your
answer,
did
you?
i
thought
you
were
going
on
to
some
other
points.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
suggestion
that
they
couldn't
go
back
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
usually
assumed
that
the
jury
is
not
finished
until
it's
finished?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
agree
--
i
don't
think
you
agree
that
it
was
their
stated
verdict,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
mcdaniel,
how
--
how
probable
is
it
that
when
the
jury
is
polled,
and
having
voted
unanimously
when
they
were
back
in
the
jury
room,
one
of
the
members
of
the
jury
changes
his
mind
and
votes
the
other
way?
that's
not
at
all
probable,
is
it?
but
it
happens
sometimes,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
when
it
happens,
what's
the
result?
