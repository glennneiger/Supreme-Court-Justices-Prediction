justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
you've
conceded
away
your
case
when
you
say
that.
the
one
characteristic
of
a
verdict
that
seems
perfectly
clear
to
me
is
that
it
is
final.
the
jury
can't
render
a
verdict
and
be
discharged
and
then
come
back
the
next
day
and
say,
you
know
what,
some
of
us
--
one
of
us
has
changed
his
mind
or
her
mind.
it's
the
final
vote.
and
so
why
isn't
the
critical
question
here
whether
what
the
--
what
the
foreperson
said
was,
this
is
our
final
vote,
we're
not
going
to
go
back,
this
is
it;
or
this
is
the
way
we
voted,
now
and
it's
--
one
or
more
of
us
may
have
wanted
to
--
wanted
to
retain
the
right,
reserve
the
right
to
go
back
and
--
and
vote
again.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
there
was
no
manifest
necessity
to
declare
a
mistrial
as
to
any
count,
in
which
case
there
could
be
no
retrial
whatsoever,
or
no
manifest
necessity
to
declare
a
mistrial
on
capital
murder.
and
if
you're
saying
the
latter,
then
what
would
you
have
us
do
with
the
decision
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court
that
arkansas
law
does
not
allow
a
partial
verdict?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
this
a
fair
explanation
of
arkansas
law
which
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
perfectly
clear?
what
the
jury
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
vote
on
the
greatest
offense
first
and
reach
a
reasonably
firm
vote.
and
if
they
reach
a
reasonably
firm
vote
that
is
unanimous
not
guilty,
then
they
can
move
on
to
the
next
--
to
the
lower
offenses,
but
that
reasonably
firm
vote
is
not
an
absolutely
final
vote,
and
there
is
still
the
possibility
for
the
jury
to
go
back.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
a
correct
understanding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
is
the
question
what
arkansas
law
actually
says,
or
what
the
jury
understood
arkansas
law
to
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
green
and
price,
the
defendants
were
tried
once
on
the
greater
offense,
and
jeopardy
terminated
without
a
finding
of
manifest
necessity
regarding
the
termination
of
jeopardy.
to
me
that
is
the
sound
basis
for
those
decisions.
but
i
have
to
agree
with
what
justice
kagan
said.
the
justice
black's
reasoning
in
green,
that
the
jury
impliedly
acquitted
the
defendant
of
the
greater
offense
by
convicting
the
defendant
of
the
lesser
offense
doesn't
really
make
any
sense
because
they
could
have
simply
been
in
disagreement
about
the
greater
offense.
