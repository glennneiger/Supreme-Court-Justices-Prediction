justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
would
they
get
anything,
anyway?
i
mean,
your
brief
suggests
that
somehow
there
are
these
unsecured
creditors
in
the
mix
who
are
going
to
receive
some
benefit
if
your
understanding
of
this
statute
goes
forward.
but
you
know,
in
a
circumstance
like
this,
doesn't
the
secured
creditor
either
get
the
property
or
get
the
money
from
the
property
and
the
unsecured
creditors
are
out
of
the
mix
regardless?
justice
elena
kagan
but
those
are
--
those
continue
forward,
so
even
if
the
secured
creditor
got
the
property,
there
would
be
mechanic's
liens
on
the
property,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
neff,
can
i
understand
how
your
system
would
actually
work
in
practice?
suppose
you
have
an
auction
and
there
is
the
top
value
was
$500,
and
then
you
have
the
secured
creditor
let's
say
is
in
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
comes
in
and
says:
we
couldn't
credit
bid,
but
we
--
excuse
me
--
we
couldn't
pay
cash,
but
we
think
it's
$750.
justice
elena
kagan
and
now
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
it's
$500
or
$750
after
the
auction
has
gone
forward.
what
happens?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
now
let's
say
the
court
says:
you
know,
i
think
that
the
government
is
right;
it's
really
$750.
but
you've
already
had
a
sale.
justice
elena
kagan
and
you've
sold
it
for
$500.
justice
elena
kagan
but
doesn't
clause
(i)
depend
upon
a
judicial
valuation?
in
clause
(i)
the
court
has
to
say:
what
is
the
present
value
of
your
property,
so
that
it
knows
what
the
right
income
stream
is.
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
in
subsection
(iii)
where
it
talks
about
substitute
collateral?
that's
completely
a
judicial
valuation,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
the
petitioner
suggests
that
the
usual
rule
that
the
specific
governs
rather
than
the
general
provision
doesn't
apply
in
this
case
because
the
specific
is
not
a
subset
of
the
general.
what's
--
what's
your
view
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
assumes
that
you
can
just
pull
out
a
wad
of
cash
from
your
back
pocket,
but
mostly
the
debtors
are
not
in
that
position.
so
it
just
seems
like
a
gigantic
waste
of
time.
