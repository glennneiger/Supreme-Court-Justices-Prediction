but
how
does
one
determine
what
is
the
indubitable
equivalent
of
the
creditor's
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
sale
--
something
--
the
sale
can't
go
on
without
the
court's
approval.
i
mean,
the
auction
has
to
have
the
court's
approval,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
what
qualifies
as
indubitably
equivalent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
creditor
thinks
that
the
sale
was
--
undervalued
the
assets,
that
it
--
it
wasn't
the
equivalent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
that
be
a
reason
for
saying
there's
no
adequate
--
there's
nothing
under
(iii)
that
would
be
the
indubitable
equivalent?
in
other
words,
one
thing
is
to
say
that
if
you
--
if
(ii)
--
if
you
fit
into
(ii),
that's
it,
you
don't
go
to
(iii).
another
is
to
say,
well
you
can
go
to
(iii),
but
it's
most
unlikely
that
there
would
be
the
indubitable
equivalent
of
allowing
credit
bidding.

what
is
the
reference?
in
clause
(ii)
we
were
just
told,
the
last
clause
refers
to
"under
clause
(i)
or
clause
(iii).
"
what
--
what
is
the
reference
in
(ii)
to
clause
(iii)?
what
does
that
mean?
