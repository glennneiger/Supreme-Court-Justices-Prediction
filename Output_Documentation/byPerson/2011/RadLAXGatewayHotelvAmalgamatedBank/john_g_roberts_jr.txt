chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-166,
radlax
gateway
hotel
v.
amalgamated
bank.
mr.
neff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
pretty
much
what
he
bargained
for
when
he
insisted
upon
security
before
giving
the
loan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
depriving
the
secured
creditor
of
the
opportunity
to
hold
on
to
the
asset,
because
he
thinks
it
is,
for
perhaps
a
short
period,
unreasonably
devalued.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
i
cut
off
your
answer
to
justice
alito?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
case,
though,
where
you
would
not
want
the
asset
sold.
in
other
words,
looking
at
it
he
thinks
for
particular
unusual
situations,
this
is
vastly
undervalued;
i
am
holding
an
asset
that
is
going
to
appreciate
if
i
hold
onto
it.
so
he
doesn't
want
the
asset
sold.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
doubtless
equivalent
of
his
claim?
measured
by
the
current
market
conditions,
or
does
that
include
some
premium
based
on
the
assumption
that
it's
going
to
increase
in
value
over
some
period?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
--
or
he
is
entitled
to
realize
the
indubitable
equivalent
of
his
claims.
you
really
do
just
kind
of
elide
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
"or".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
friend
on
the
other
side
suggests
that
(ii)
and
(iii)
address
different
ways
of
protecting
the
secured
creditor.
(ii)
is
procedural,
right?
you
can
go
through
these
procedures
and
you
can
cram
down
so
long
as
you
are
going
through
these
procedures,
which
include
credit
bidding,
or
you
can
cram
down
if
you
ensure
that
he
receives
the
indubitable
equivalent,
a
substantive
protection.
what
is
wrong
with
that
reading?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
is,
of
course,
a
good
reason
which
is
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
is
you
do
want
to
look
out
for
the
other
creditors
as
well.
and
if
the
secured
creditor
is
getting
indubitably
the
value
of
this
security,
why
don't
you
weigh
in
the
balance
at
least
the
interests
of
the
other
creditors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
in
this
particular
case,
but
that's
not
going
to
be
true
in
every
case
and
we
are
asked
to
issue
a
ruling
that
is
going
to
apply
in
every
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
the
whole
premise
of
why
this
problem
arises
is
that
the
security
is
worth
a
lot
less
than
--
than
it
was
obviously
when
it
was
purchased.
or
a
lot
less
than
--
a
lot
less
than
the
claim
that
it
was
meant
to
secure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
it
work
in
practice?
is
this
something
that
is
subject
of
extensive
negotiation?
the
secured
creditor
says,
well,
i'm
interested
in
bidding
in
a
credit
bid,
but
i
appreciate
that
that's
going
to
make
it
difficult
for
you
to
get
cash.
and
you've
got
these
unsecured
creditors
who
would
want
--
and
so,
what?
i'm
not
going
to
credit
bid,
so
long
as
--
or
i
will
only
credit
bid
up
to
this
particular
amount;
or,
let's
sit
down
and
work
out
a
deal,
negotiate
over
exactly
how
we're
going
to
handle
my
security.
is
that
really
how
it
happens,
or
is
that
not
--
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
earlier
we
have
never
said
that
the
specific
has
to
be
a
subset
of
the
general.
how
--
how
would
it
otherwise
be
specific,
and
the
one
general?
it
seems
if
they
are
not
a
subset,
then
they
are
alternatives.
i
don't
see
how
the
whole
doctrine
makes
any
sense
if
the
specific
is
not
a
subset
of
the
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
we
say
our
doctrine
says
the
specific
controls
over
the
general,
the
specific
is
a
subset
of
the
general?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
got
a
whole
cadre
of
u.s.
trustees
that
presumably
can
look
out
for
the
interests
of
the
poor
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
we
were
worried
about
the
situation
where
it's
a
creditor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
those
cases,
of
course,
the
trustee's
there,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
of
course
it
could
bid
up
if
it
thinks
that
there
are
going
to
be
other
bidders,
right?
it
has
a
lot
more
flexibility
than
the
other
bidders
to
--
to
the
extent
of
its
security
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
just
begs
the
question.
congress
gave
them
a
right
--
i
mean,
that's
what
we
are
deciding,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
valuing
property
is
what
bankruptcy
judges
do
all
the
time,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
neff,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
11-166,
radlax
gateway
hotel
versus
amalgamated
bank.
