justice

it
makes
no
sense
to
me
what
you
are
saying,
because
under
all
circumstances
the
credit
bid,
unless
the
property
is
valued
higher
than
the
credit
bid
amount,
but
then
another
bidder
could
--
could
make
--
enter
that
bid.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
maximum
value
always
has
to
be
the
value
of
the
credit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
--
if
the
--
if
the
creditor
is
willing
to
put
it
at
risk
that
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
just
not
true
from
what
you
just
said.
meaning
what
you
just
said
is
that
the
buyer
obviously
is
paying
other
things
off,
and
by
definition
he's
deducting
that
from
the
purchase
price.
no
one
gives
a
purchase
price
for
a
piece
of
property
and
agrees
to
pay
something
else
and
gives
the
highest
price
for
the
property
once
they've
done
that.
so
what
you're
asking
for
is
permission
for
the
debtor
to
use
this
property
to
pay
other
debts,
and
that's
what
i
thought
a
secured
interest
prevented.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
doesn't
he
get--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why
doesn't
he
get
everything
that
the
buyer
is
promising
to
everyone
else?
for
that
indubitably
is
part
of
the
price,
because
he
is
giving
out
money
to
others,
that's
part
of
the
value
of
this
property.
so
why
isn't
the
creditor,
the
secured
creditor,
entitled
to
all
of
the
proceeds
from
the
property?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
--
with
sales
price,
but
not
from
all
the
payments.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
still
haven't
answered
my--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
still
haven't
answered
my
question.
if
the
buyer
had
money
that
he's
willing
to
give
up
to
others,
why
isn't
he
putting
it
in
the
purchase
price?
why
isn't
that
part
of
the
price?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
explain
what
the
reasoning
is
for
requiring
a
credit
bid
if
property
is
sold
during
the
plan,
but
not
permitting
it
when
it's
sold
at
the
plan's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--doesn't
that
delay
the
bankruptcy
in
every
situation?
i
can't
actually
understand
what
benefit
other
than
delay
of
the
bankruptcy
process
that
would
occasion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
uh-hmm.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
don't
have
that
right
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
vast
majority
of
bankruptcy
courts
have
permitted
credit
bidding
in
these
situations.
so
if
the
vast
majority
of
bankruptcies
have
stalking
horses,
then
the
norm
is
working
without
us
having
to
rule
in
your
favor.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
stalking
horses
still
come
in.
so
it's
not
as
if
the
363(k)
procedure
is
failing
in
maximizing
prices.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
the
--
what's
the
purpose
--
if
you
permit
credit
bidding,
why
do
you
go
through
the
sale
at
all,
if
it's
always
--
if
the
credit
is
always
going
to
be
higher
than
the
value?
why
don't
you
just
turn
over
the
property
under
(iii)?
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
go
through
the
sham
of
a
sale?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
is
the
stalking
horse
dance.
at
what
point
do
they
credit
bid
until
they
get
the
highest
price
from
someone
else
and
then
let
that
other
person
have
it,
is
that
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
do
you
think
under
363(k),
what's
good
--
what
would
constitute
or
has
constituted
in
the
case
law
good
cause
not
to
permit
credit
bidding?
what
situations
have
arisen
under
363(k)
where
a
court
has
found
good
cause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
does
a
creditor
commit
malfeasance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
a
person
who
believes
that
in
the
business
world
the
greatest
security
is
just
knowledge
of
what
courts
will
do.
and
what
the
two
courts
who
have
agreed
with
you
have
done
is
contrary
to
what
the
majority
of
courts
have
done
for
the
longest
time.
what's
the
value
for
us
upsetting
the
norm?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
business
value
for
upsetting
the
norm?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
it
means,
because
people
didn't
think
they
could
do
it
in
plan
sales.
so
why
should
we
upset
the
expectation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
could
have
gone
under
(i)
and
given
the
secured
lender
what
he's
entitled
to,
which
is
a
future
stream
of
payment.
