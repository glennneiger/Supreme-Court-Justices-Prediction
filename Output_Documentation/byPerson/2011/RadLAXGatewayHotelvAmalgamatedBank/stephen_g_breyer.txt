justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
wrong
with
that?
i
mean,
a
creditor
loaned
you
a
million
dollars.
for
the
million
dollars,
he
got
an
interest,
a
secured
interest
in
a
piece
of
property.
and
that
property
is
worth
whatever
it
was
--
whatever
it's
worth,
less
than
a
million.
and
he
says
that's
the
deal.
i
--
i
have
a
secured
interest
in
this;
i
want
the
property.
you
are
better
off
because
you
can
stretch
out
the
payments
over
time
and
maybe
you
don't
have
to
give
it
to
him
immediately,
but
i
don't
see
anything
unfair
about
saying,
give
him
the
property
if
he
wants
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
accordance
with
(i),
(ii)
and
(iii).
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
skip
those.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
as
i
read
it,
to
put
it
out
on
the
table,
this
makes
perfect
sense.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
help
the
debtor
a
little
without
mucking
up
the
secured
creditor's
collateral.
choice
(i)
gives
the
secured
creditor
his
collateral,
and
there
is
still
a
lien
on
it.
he
has
what
he
had
before,
and
the
debtor
is
better
off
because
he
can
stretch
the
payments
out
over
time,
and
that's
one
and
two.
choice
(ii),
we
give
the
creditor
some
new
collateral.
hmm,
that's
a
little
risky,
but
to
be
sure
it's
fair,
we
are
absolutely
certain,
with
a
few
exceptions
not
relevant,
that
the
creditor
can
credit
bid.
so
he
has
it
within
his
control.
choice
(iii),
something
else
which
comes
up
in
different
situations,
for
example,
a
creditor
who
is
over-secured,
see,
and
they
want
to
sell
the
piece
of
property.
and
he
says,
sure,
i
will
let
you
sell
it,
but
i
want
something
that's
the
equivalent.
give
me
this
other
property
over
here
that
you
own
that
has
no
liens
at
all.
and
the
judge
can
look
at
that
and
say
that's
fair.
that's
what
(iii)
is
basically
about,
as
far
as
i
could
understand
it.
so
it
all
makes
sense
to
me,
and
i
don't
understand
why
you
would
want
to
have
a
rule
saying
that
(iii)
trumps
(i)
and
(ii)
and
stops
credit
bidding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
the
whole
thing
as
i
am
seeing
it
at
this
moment.
so
i'll
give
you
a
chance
to
reply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't
have
the
language,
which
is
why
we
have
a
case.
but
i
mean,
trying
to
interpret
it
in
a
way
that
makes
sense,
what
is
wrong
with
what
i
said
as
a
way
that
makes
sense?
i
mean,
why,
since
we
are
trying
to
give
the
--
the
creditor
the
indubitable
value,
at
the
very
least
--
the
best
way
to
do
that
would
be
let
the
creditor
credit
bid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
not?
and
you
can
read
it.
you
don't
have
to
read
it
the
way
that
you
want.
you
could
read
it
the
opposite
way,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
looking
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
a
bankruptcy
system--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is
trying
to
get
secured
creditors
what
they
have
their
security
in,
while
giving
the
debtor
the
advantage
here
of
being
able
to
stretch
out
his
payments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
in
subsection
(iii),
if
it
applies
here
--
i
assume
--
suppose
it
doesn't
apply
here.
there
is
a
safeguard
against
having
no
bidder.
bidders
who
would
bid
more
than
what
the
creditor
thinks
it's
worth,
the
creditor
will
want
them
in
this,
and
if
he
doesn't
want
it
in,
it's
because
he
thinks
it's
worth
more
in
his
own
hands.
so
what's
the
problem?
but
there
is
a
problem
the
other
way.
the
problem
the
other
way,
and
i'm
not
saying
it's
this
case,
but
there
are
--
is
that
the
insiders
say
to
the
stalking
horse:
we
would
like
you
to
put
this
up
at
a
low
price
and
give
us
a
job.
and
if
they
keep
the
creditor
out,
well,
that's
a
big
incentive.
and
they
are
the
ones
who
know
what
a
hotel
is
worth.
the
judge
doesn't
know,
and
there
is
always
leeway.
and
so
that
was
worrying
me
about
this
fact
pattern.
you
want
--
you
want
to
get
rid
of
my
worry?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
concern
was,
i
gather,
there
is
no
other
bidder,
you
have
said.
you've
just
found
the
stalking
horse.
you
agree
to
pay
the
stalking
horse
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
in
case
he
doesn't
get
it.
and
then
the
people
from
the
inside
are
being
hired
by
the
stalking
horse
if
he
wins.
now,
i'm
not
--
i'm
sure
they
are
acting
very
honestly,
but
you
would
have
to
say
in
such
a
situation
that
there
is
an
incentive
to
try
to
value
everything
on
the
low
side
by
the
debtor
to
make
sure
that
stalking
horse
gets
the
property.
and
that
incentive
is
destroyed,
or
at
least
doesn't
work,
if
you
allow
the
creditor
bid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
just
guessing
before,
but,
i
mean,
if
you're
right,
what
is
the
(iii),
the
indubitable
equivalent,
what
kind
of
situation
does
that
come
up?
i
mean,
i
was
guessing
it
would
come
up,
maybe
an
over
secured
creditor,
they
want
to
--
they
want
to
sell
the
property,
and
he
still
wants
his
security,
and
they
have
to
put
in
equivalent
property
that
wasn't
mortgaged,
but
i
was
just
guessing.
so
--
so
what
is
it
really
--
what
is
it
really
used
for,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i'm
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
was
thinking.
