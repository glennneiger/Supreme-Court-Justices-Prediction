ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
secured
creditors
bargain
for
the
right
to
be
repaid
in
full
or,
if
not,
to
foreclose
and
take
the
collateral
that
secures
their
loan.
when
a
chapter
11
bankruptcy
plan
is
going
to
cram
down
a
plan
over
the
objection
of
a
secured
creditor,
section
1129(b)(2)(a)
gives
the
secured
creditor
the
ability
to
protect
those
rights
regardless
of
the
proposed
treatment
of
its
collateral.
specifically,
when
the
plan
proposes,
as
here,
to
sell
the
collateral
free
and
clear
of
the
secured
creditor's
liens
and
give
the
secured
creditor
nothing
but
the
proceeds
from
that
sale,
clause
(ii)
entitles
the
secured
creditor
to
bid
what
it
is
owed
in
the
absence
of
cause
to
preclude
it.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
we
give
full
meaning
to
the
"or".
we
don't
dispute
that
these
are
three
alternative
ways
to
cram
down
--
down
a
plan.
the
question
here
is
or
what?
and
the
question
is
the
scope
of
the
alternatives
and
in
which
circumstances
in
they
apply.
and
here
congress
turned
its
attention
to
precisely
the
situation
at
hand
and
determined
what
the
requirements
were,
but
not
just
the
requirements
for
a
sale
free
and
clear.
it's
not
like
clause
(ii)
says:
if
you
sell
it
free
and
clear
and
you
allow
credit
bidding,
then
that's
way
to
go.
it's
not
just
the
requirement
of
credit
bidding.
it
also
sets
forth
the
only
exception
to
credit
bidding.
and
petitioners'
reading
would
read
clause
(iii)
to
be
a
much
bigger
exception.
now,
petitioners
here
tried
and
failed
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
prove
cause,
and
they
don't
appeal
that.
so
they
are
trying
to
create
a
much
bigger
exception
to
the
exception
congress
allowed.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
your
honor,
cause.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
so
under
--
we
reprint
the
1129
clause
(ii)
is
on
20a
in
the
red
brief
at
the
back.
and
it
provides:
"for
the
sale,
subject
to
section
363(k)
of
this
title,
of
any
property
that
is
subject
to
liens
securing
such
claims
free
and
clear
of
such
liens.
"
and
that
refers
you
to
363(k),
which
is
also
at
the
back
of
our
brief.
and
363(k)
provides
that:
"unless
the
court
for
cause
orders
otherwise,
the
holder
of
such
claim
may
bid
at
such
sale;
and
if
the
holder
of
such
claim
purchases
such
property,
such
holder
may
offset
such
claim
against
the
purchase
price
of
such
property.
"
so
my
point
is,
clause
(ii)
is
not
just
if
you
let
them
credit
bid
then
that's
one
way
to
go
to
fair
and
equitable.
it's
you
must
let
them
credit
bid
unless
cause
is
shown.
and
they
tried
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
justice
scalia,
to
prove
cause,
and
the
district
court
found
against
them
on
that
point,
and
they
don't
appeal
it.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
the
three
clauses,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
all
three
of
the
clauses
have
both
procedural
and
substantive
components.
and
essentially
what
petitioners
seek
to
do
here
is
exchange
their
preferred
procedure,
which
is
a
sale
without
allowing
us
to
credit
bid
followed
by
a
judicial
determination
of
whether
whatever
number
that
sale
produces
is
high
enough
to
be
our
secured
claim.
but
the
whole
point
is,
if
the
secured
creditor
is
willing
to
bid
one
more
dollar
of
what
it's
owed
at
the
sale,
that
is
the
value
of
our
secured
claim.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
is
definitely
the
fear,
justice
alito.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
because
valuations
are
inherently
uncertain,
and
congress
knew
that.
and
in
this
bankruptcy
code
congress
tried
to
move
away
from
judicial
valuations
for
precisely
that
reason.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
true,
justice
kagan.
but
if
you
proceed
through
clause
(i),
the
code
provides
a
secured
creditor
with
a
different
protection
against
undervaluation.
so
the
whole
code
structure
is
set
up
to
protect
the
secured
creditor
against
the
risk
of
undervaluation
of
its
claim.
and
that's
the
section
1111(b)
election.
so
section
1111(b)
election
allows
the
secured
creditor
who
is
undersecured
and
is
afraid
that
their
value
of
their
property
will
be
misvalued
in
a
clause
(i)
to
elect
to
have
their
entire
face
value
of
their
claim
treated
as
secured.
so
here,
the
lenders
are
owed
more
than
$130
million.
if
they
were
to
proceed
under
clause
(i),
the
lenders
would
have
the
option
to
have
that
whole
$130
million
treated
as
secured.
and
that
would
be
the
value
of
the
secured
claim.
and
under
clause
(i),
yes,
we
would
then
be
subject
to
the
judicial
determination
of
the
present
value
of
whatever
a
note
paying
out
$130
million
would
be,
but
two
protections
we
would
have.
they
wouldn't
be
determining
the
principal.
the
principal,
the
face
value
of
the
note
would
have
to
be
$130
million;
and
the
lien
that
we
would
retain
would
be
$130
million.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
would
be
true,
but
i
think
in
that
situation
we
would
also
have
the
option
to
make
the
1111(b)
election.
and,
therefore,
they
would
have
to
substitute
collateral
that
would
be
up
to
the
$130
million
mark.
so
it's
true
--
and
it's
true
that
congress
did
leave
this
other,
but
it
is
an
other.
and
i
think
another
way
to
--
another
point
to
make
that
clear
is
the
fact
that
clause
(ii)
expressly
has
a
role
for
clause
(iii),
and
it
doesn't
come
into
play
until
after
the
sale
at
which
the
secured
creditor
gets
to
credit
bid.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
the
secured
creditors
aren't
able
to
come
in
and
bid
their
credit,
and
if
the
secured
creditors
can't,
as
is
a
real
risk,
raise
enough
cash
to
bid
the
amount
of
their
credit
in
cash
--
and
in
some
instances,
as
with
the
government,
they
can't,
they
actually
can't.
but
in
a
lot
of
these
complicated
loans
there
is
multiple
lenders
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
come
up
with
the
money
to
put
in,
and
they
are,
therefore
--
you
are
taking
out
of
the
marketplace
one
of
the
most
knowledgeable
bidders
about
this
property.
and
there
is
no
good
reason
to
do
that.
these
--
it's
not
like
they
are
bidding
funny
money.
they
have
already
put
in
$142
million.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
there
will
be
no
cash
for
anyone
junior
to
these
creditors
unless
these
creditors
are
paid
in
full,
regardless
of
whether
everyone
bids
in
cash
or
we
bid
in
credit.
this
property
is
well
under
water.
there
is
no
equity
in
it.
the
secured
lenders
have
lent
them
$142
million--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--in
every
case
where
the
property
is
under
water,
there
will
be
--
in
every
case
in
which
the
secured
creditor
has
a
lien
on
the
property,
the
secured
creditor
takes
first.
so
until
--
so
underwater
or
not,
until
the
secured
creditor
is
paid--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--everyone
agrees
that
the
property
is
under
water,
but
it's
important
to
note
that
the
valuations
in
this
case
that
have
been
filed
in
the
district
court
in
conjunction
with
the
relief
from
the
stay,
the
appraisals
are
different
by
tens
of
millions
of
dollars,
what
the
property
is
worth.
and
if
you
allow
that
to
go
to
a
judge
to
decide
whether
it's
enough,
that's
an
inherently
uncertain
process.
and,
you
know,
judicial
valuation,
the
court
--
tens
of
millions
of
dollars,
the
judge
could
decide,
and
it
might
not
be
a
fact
that
we
could
overturn
if
that
goes
to
a--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
legislative
history,--
justice
breyer,
suggests
two
meanings
for
it.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
two
examples.
and
that's
what
you
see
in
the
case.
there
aren't
very
many
clause
(iii)
cases.
there
will
be
many
more
if
this
court
holds
that
this
is
permissible.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
that
--
there
aren't
very
many
clause
(iii)
cases.
and
they
abandon
--
abandonment
of
the
collateral.
so
in
other
words,
they
could
decide
just
to
turn
all
of
the
collateral
over,
and
that
would
be
the
indubitable
--
that
would
be
res
ipsa,
our
secured
claim.
i
mean,
that
--
we
have
collateral
in
everything
they
own:
the
hotel,
the
garage,
all
of
the
proceeds.
or,
as
justice
kagan
was
suggesting,
some
of
the
cases
involve
providing
a
substitute
lien.
but
the
courts
are--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--courts
are
very
hesitant
to
do
that,
and
it
would
have
to
be
really
--
because
it
is
--
you
know,
you
are
stripping
our
lien;
you're
supposedly
giving
us
an
equal
lien.
so,
you
know,
maybe
if
you
can
imagine
--
maybe
if
these
creditors
owned
the
airport
at
the
dulles
--
you
know,
a
hotel
at
the
dulles
airport
and
a
parking
garage,
and
one
could
say
it's
exactly
the
same
risk
factor
and
everything,
and
we're
going
to
swap
that
in
for
this.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it's
not
a
sham,
justice
sotomayor,
because
the
creditor
--
secured
creditors
don't
often
want
to
run
a
hotel
and
parking
garage.
they
may
not
want
the
property.
so
what
they
are
interested
in
doing
is
maximizing
the
value,
getting
back
as
much
as
they
can
of
the
money
that
they--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
definitely
one
of
the
strategies.
and
if
they
--
so
they
--
so
what
clause
(ii)
allows
a
secured
creditor,
it
allows
the
secured
creditor
to
choose
whether
it
takes
its
property,
which
was
the
right
it
had
prebankruptcy,
or
whether
it's
enough.
but
if
you
leave
it
to
their
system
--
and
he's
--
i'm
sorry--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
cause
cases
include
malfeasance
of
the
creditor
in
some
way--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--malfeasance
of
the
creditor
in
some
way.
or
whether
there
might
be--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i'm
sorry,
i
can't
remember
any
specific
examples.
but
another
instance,
and
it's
actually
one
that
--
that
goes
to
something
justice
kagan
asked
earlier,
which
is,
when
there's
some
dispute
about
priority
or
whether
there
might
be
senior
liens.
so
in
this
case,
the
bankruptcy
judge
provided
at
44(a)
and
45(a),
because
there
--
there
are
some
real
estate
taxes
that
would
be
senior
to
our
liens,
and
there's
a
debate
about
whether
the
mechanic
liens
are
senior
or
not.
and
so
the
bankruptcy
judge
provided
that
--
that
--
that
here,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
either
put
up
cash
in
that
amount,
the
amount
of
the
potentially
senior
liens,
or
to
offer,
you
know,
some
security
to
cover
those
in
the
event
that
they
turn
up.
and
that
is
an
example
of
cause,
and
that
is
--
clearly
answers
the
concern
that
there
may
be
others.
no
one
junior
to
these
creditors
is
going
to
take
anything.
and
all
making
us
cash
bid
would
do,
assuming
the
secured
creditors
are
able
to
come
up
with
the
cash
to
bid
in
this
amount,
would
be
to
endless
--
just
to
pointlessly
cycle
money
into
the
estate,
and
then,
if
we're
the
winning
bid,
through
the
estate
and
back
to
us,
at
the
risk
of
their
siphoning
off
the
money
that
really
shouldn't
go
to
anyone
else
because
we
have
--
the
cash
collateral
is
these
secured
creditors',
the
hotel
and
the
parking
garage
are
all
these
secured
creditors'
collateral.
now,
the
petitioners
say
this
is
going
to
--
if
you
let
the
secured
creditors
bid,
this
is
going
to
chill
credit
bidding.
well,
they
tried
to
prove
that
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
the
bankruptcy
court,
at
pages
43(a)
and
44(a),
rejected
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but,
anyway,
as
a
matter
of
theory,
their
proposal
--
who
would
bid
in
their
proposal?
their
proposal
is,
you
do
the
due
diligence,
you
have
to
prove
you
have
the
money,
you
put
up
the
bid,
and
then
at
the
back
end
you
know
that
the
secured
creditor
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
tell
the
bankruptcy
judge,
i
would
have
bid
more
with
my
secured
credit.
so
anyone
who
bids
knows
that
there's
the
potential
that
it's
all
going
to
be
a
waste
of
time.
and
then
how
do
you
do
it
over
at
that
point?
once
everybody
has
shown
their
hand,
put
their
bids
in,
what,
are
you
going
to
take
a
mulligan
after
the
--
after
the
bankruptcy
court
says
no,
they're
not
getting
their
indubitable
equivalent
because
i
find
they
would
have
bid
more
in
their
security?
well,
that's
just
--
that
--
who's
going
to
bid
in
that
situation?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
all
those
things
are
ways
that
it
can
happen,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
certainly
counsel
is
distinguishing
the
--
during
the
plan
sale
requirement,
where
he
concedes
that
if
you
do
a
363(b)
sale,
you
know,
363(k)
applies,
but
he
says
it's
not
a
problem
because
you
can
negotiate.
there
are
actually
many
negotiations
in
a
plan
sale
context.
and
it
would
be
odd,
i
would
suggest,
that
you
can
do
a
cramdown
plan
over
the
secured
creditor's
objection
and
have
less
credit
bidding
rights
than
you
can
when
you
agree
to
do
it.
and
so
in
the
end,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
secured
creditor
coming
in
and
bidding
its
credit
and
taking
the
asset.
after
all,
they
already
put
in
$142
million.
they're
owed
$130
million.
the
debtors
have
no
equity
in
--
in
this
process.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
don't
think
that
latter
way
would
be
the
better
reading
of
the
statute,
justice
ginsburg,
because
congress
turned
its
attention
to
this
precise
problem
and
decided
that
the
best
way
to
protect
the
secured
creditor
against
the
risk
of
undervaluation
was
to
allow
it
to
--
to
bid.
and
i
--
and
i
think,
for
the
reasons
i
said
earlier,
the
system
that
they
propose
is
not
a
workable
system
or
a
good
system,
and
it
wouldn't
be
good
to
have
there
be
uncertainty
about
the
auction,
about
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
ultimately,
you
know,
go
through.
and
as
long
as
the
secured
creditor
is
willing
to
bid
at
the
--
at
the
auction
its
secured
credit,
put
its
money
where
its
mouth
is,
that
is
the
value
of
its
--
of
its
secured
claim,
and
so
it
could
never
be
the
indubitable
equivalent
to
go
under
(iii),
where
it's
not
allowed
to
bid.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
this
court's
never
applied
the
rule
in
that
way.
and
i
think
the
court
--
it's
always
the
case
that
when
the
court's
looking
at
these
kinds
of
problems,
that
the
general
provision
could
be
read
to
encompass
what
the
party
before
the
court
is
seeking
to
do.
but
the
--
when
congress
has
set
up
a
precise
scheme
--
and
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
it's
not
just
the
requirements
but
also
the
exception
to
the
requirements
--
and
then
also,
the
way
that
(ii)
is
--
refers
to
(iii),
and
(iii)
doesn't
kick
in
until
after
the
sale--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
for
cause.
so
by
reading
in
363(k),
justice
scalia,
it's
not
only
the
requirement
of
credit
bidding,
but
also
the
only
exception.
but
then
also,
if
i
could
just
elaborate
this
--
the
point
about
how
it
refers
to
clause
(iii),
on
20(a)
of
our
brief,
we
set
forth
the
text.
the
final
clause
of
clause
(ii)
says
that
once
the
sale
goes
through,
the
liens
attach
to
the
proceeds
of
the
sale,
and
the
treatment
of
those
liens
on
the
proceeds
are
done
under
clause
(i)
or
clause
(iii)
of
this
subparagraph.
so
clause
(ii)
contemplates
that
there
will
be
some
judicial
determination
of
indubitable
equivalence,
but
only
after
the
amount
of
the
proceeds
--
because,
after
all,
what
we're
trying
to
determine
here
is
the
value
of
the
secured
claim.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
justice
kagan's
question
or
misunderstood
their
point.
i
thought
their
point
was
looking
specifically
at
the
--
the
facts
of
the
speedy
trial
act
case
and
saying
because
it's
a
list
and
it
says
"includes"
and
then
there
are
subsets
under
the
list,
that's
how
i
understood
their
argument.
yes,
it's
certainly
true
--
like,
take
the
venue
statute
case.
you
know,
the
general
venue
provision
clearly
covered
patent
infringement
suits,
but
then
there
was
a
specific
patent
infringement
venue
statute,
and
the
patent
infringement
statute
didn't
say
it
was
the
exclusive
patent
venue
statue,
and
the
general
venue
statute
didn't
say,
"except
as
otherwise
provided
in
the
code.
"
yet
this
court
said,
well,
the
patent
--
congress
turned
its
attention
to
patent
infringement
suits
and
created
this
venue,
and
that's--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
to
the
extent
that
i
think
it's
always
fair
to
say
that
what
the
party
who's
claiming
they
fit
within
the
general
does
could
definitionally
possibly
fit
within
the
general.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
thank
you.
