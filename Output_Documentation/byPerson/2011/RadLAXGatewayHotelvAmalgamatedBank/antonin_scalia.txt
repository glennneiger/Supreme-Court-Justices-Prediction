justice

scalia
could
the
--
could
the
judge
say
when
the
proposal
is
made
to
him,
the
only
way
i
can
be
sure
that
it
is
the
indubitable
equivalent
is
to
have
the
sale
open
to
credit
bidding,
which
is
what
we
always
do?
can
the
judge
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
neff,
can
--
are
you
done?
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
want
to
stop
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
--
let's
look
at
the
text.
little
(ii)
provides
for
exactly
what
you
want
to
do
here.
what
you
want
to
do
under
(iii)
is
precisely
what
(ii)
says,
except
you
want
to
eliminate
subject
to
section
363(k)
of
this
title.
right?
does
it
--
does
it
make
sense
for
a
provision
to
say
you
can
do
it
three
ways:
number
(i),
number
(ii),
you
can
have
this
sale
subject
to
credit
bidding,
and
number
(iii),
after
--
after
saying
that,
specifically,
oh,
you
can
have
this
sale
not
subject
to
credit
bidding?
that's
not
a
very
sensible
statute.
why
go
through
that
--
that
problem
of
--
of
saying
number
(ii),
if
you
could
have
left
it
to
number
(iii)
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
neff,
don't
you
feel
sorry
for
the
united
states?
the
united
states
is
often
in
the
creditor
situation,
and
the
united
states
cannot
come
up
with
cash.
are
they
going
to
run
to
congress
and
get
an
appropriation
for
each
--
each
security
case
it
has?
what
--
what
do
you
propose
we
do
with
the
united
states?
the
united
states
just
can't
take
any
security
interests
anymore
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
wouldn't
the
court
always
say,
when
it's
confronted
with
this
situation,
the
government
comes
in
and
the
court
says,
yes,
well,
you
know,
i
guess
that
that
price
is
probably
so
low
because
nobody
could
credit
bid.
wouldn't
that
always
be
a
--
a
frailty
of
whatever
--
whatever
price
it
sold
for?
wouldn't
it
always
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
might
be,
but
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
take
a
genius
to
figure
out
that
if
you
allow
people
to
bid
for
cash
or
for
credit,
you
are
going
to
get
more
bids
and
higher
bids
than
if
you
allow
them
to
bid
for
cash
only.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
means
that
you
can't
find
a
buyer
who
is
willing
to
pay
that
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
realize
the
judge
had
to
approve--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
judge
has
to
approve
the
stalking
horse?
justice
antonin
scalia
say
it
again?
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
tried
and
failed
to
prove
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
lost
you.
it's
not
just
the
requirements
but
the
exceptions
to
the
requirements.
what
are
you
referring
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
--big
case
for
the
government,
ms.
harrington,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
big
case
for
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
just
said
is
so
long
as
they
come
in
with
some
appraisals
that
are
above
what
--
what
the
property
sold
at
for
cash,
then
it's
not
the
indubitable
equivalent?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you've
got
to
have
at
least
one
appraiser
who
says
it's
--
it's
worth
more.
is
that
all
it
takes?
justice
antonin
scalia
indubitable
is
indubitable.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
have
one
honest
appraiser
who
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
happens
if
you
go
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
says:
there
is
one
higher
bid,
so
i
can't
say
it's
indubitable?
then
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
2007,
the
petitioners
here,
radlax
gateway
hotel
and
radlax
gateway
deck
purchased
a
hotel
near
los
angeles
international
airport,
along
with
an
adjacent
lot
on
which
they
planned
to
build
a
parking
structure.
to
finance
the
purchase
and
the
improvements,
they
obtained
a
$142
million
loan
secured
by
a
blanket
lien
on
all
of
their
assets.
respondent
amalgamated
bank
here
is
the
trustee
and
administrative
agent
for
the
lender.
building
the
parking
structure
proved
more
expensive
than
the
borrowers
had
anticipated.
within
two
years,
they
ran
out
of
funds
and
were
forced
to
--
forced
to
halt
construction.
in
august
of
2009,
they
filed
petitions
for
relief
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code
at
the
time
they
owed
more
than
$120
million
on
the
loan
with
$1
million
in
interest
accruing
every
month.
now
chapter
11
bankruptcy
is
implemented
according
to
a
plan,
typically
proposed
by
the
debtor,
which
specifies
how
the
debtor
will
repay
its
creditors.
if
the
plan
meets
statutory
requirements,
the
bankruptcy
court
may
confirm
it.
certain
types
of
plans
known
as
“cramdown
plans”
maybe
confirmed
even
if
creditors
object.
those
plans
must
be
fair
and
equitable
and
a
special
statutory
provision,
title
11
u.s.c.
section
1129(b)(2)(a),
which
i
will
hereinafter
refer
to
as
(2)(a)
for
simplicity's
purpose,
establishes
criteria
for
determining
when
that
condition
is
met
with
respect
to
secured
claims,
like
the
one
at
issue
here.
the
cramdown
plan
proposed
by
the
radlax
debtors
envisioned
sale
of
the
hotel
and
the
adjacent
parking
property
at
an
auction
and
using
the
sale
proceeds
to
repay
the
bank.
the
opening
bid
at
auction
would
be
close
to
$50
million
dollars,
substantially
less
than
the
bank
is
owed.
of
course
the
bank
might
wish
to
buy
the
property
itself
if
the
alternative
would
be
receiving
sale
proceeds
that
fall
far
short
of
what
it
believes
to
be
the
property's
value.
under
the
debtor's
proposed
auction
procedures,
however,
the
bank
would
not
be
allowed
to
bid
for
the
property
using
the
debt
it
is
owed
to
offset
the
purchase
price,
a
practice
known
as
credit-bidding.
instead,
the
bank
would
have
to
pony
up
cash.
the
bankruptcy
court
denied
the
debtor's
proposal
holding
that
the
auction
procedures
did
not
comply
with
(2)(a)'s
requirements
for
cramdown
plans.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
a
chapter
11
plan
crammed
down
over
the
objection
of
a
secured
creditor
must
be
one
of
three
requirements
in
order
to
be
fair
and
equitable
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
under
(2)(a),
clause
(i),
the
debtor
may
sell
the
secured
property
subject
to
the
lien
with
the
secured
creditor
to
receive
deferred
cash
payments.
under
clause
(ii),
the
debtor
may
sell
the
property
free
and
clear
of
the
lien
at
a
sale
at
which
the
creditor
may
credit-bid.
in
lieu
of
the
lien
on
the
property
the
creditor
receives
a
lien
on
the
sale
proceeds
or
under
clause
(iii),
the
plan
may
provide
the
secure
creditor
with
"the
indubitable
equivalent"
of
its
claim.
here,
the
debtors
claim
to
sell
their
property
free
and
clear
of
the
bank's
lien
and
to
repay
the
bank
with
the
sales
proceeds.
that
is
precisely
the
type
of
plan
covered
by
clause
(ii),
except
that
the
debtor's
plan
would
not
permit
the
bank
to
credit-bid.
the
debtor's
claim
that
even
though
their
plan
flunks
clause
(ii),
it
may
satisfy
clause
(iii)
by
providing
the
bank
with
“the
indubitable
equivalent”
of
its
secured
claim
in
the
form
of
cash
generated
by
the
auction.
we
disagree.
as
we
have
previously
explained
“it
is
a
common
place
of
statutory
construction
that
the
specific
governs
the
general.”
in
a
statutory
scheme
like
the
one
at
issue
here
where
a
general
authorization
and
a
more
limited
specific
authorization
exist
side
by
side,
regulated
parties
normally
may
not
sidestep
the
requirements
of
the
specific
provision
simply
by
invoking
the
general
one.
instead,
as
we
stated
in
1932,
and
we
--
and
reaffirmed
as
recently
as
2010
“general
language
of
a
statutory
provision
although
broad
enough
to
include
it
will
not
be
held
to
apply
to
a
matter
specifically
dealt
with
in
another
part
of
the
same
enactment.”
here,
clause
(ii)
is
a
detailed
provision
that
spells
out
the
requirements
for
selling
property
free
of
liens
while
clause
(iii)
is
a
broadly
worded
provision
that
says
nothing
about
such
a
sale.
as
a
result,
the
debtors
in
this
case
must
comply
with
the
terms
of
clause
(ii).
of
course
the
general
specific
canon
is
not
an
absolute
rule
and
it
can
be
overcome
by
textual
indications
of
meaning
that
point
the
other
way,
but
the
debtors
have
identified
no
such
indications
here.
the
parties
have
also
debated
the
bankruptcy
code's
purposes,
pre-code
practices
and
the
pros
and
cons
of
credit-bidding.
none
of
those
issues
is
relevant
here,
however,
because
the
text
of
(2)(a)
is
clear.
although
the
jargon
in
this
case
is
complicated,
the
statutory
interpretation
question
is
an
easy
one.
we
hold
that
the
debtors
may
not
obtain
confirmation
of
a
chapter
11
cramdown
plan
that
provides
for
the
sale
of
collateral
free
and
clear
of
the
bank's
lien,
but
does
not
permit
the
bank
to
credit-bid
at
the
sale.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous
except
for
justice
kennedy
who
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
