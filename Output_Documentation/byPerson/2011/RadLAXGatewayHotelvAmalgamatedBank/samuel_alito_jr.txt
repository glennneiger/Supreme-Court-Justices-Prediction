well,
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
issue
who
is
going
to
decide
whether
something
is
really
the
indubitable
equivalent?
is
it
going
to
be
the
judge,
which
is
what
you
would
like,
or
is
it
going
to
be
determined
through
a
particular
bidding
procedure--
justice

alito,

--namely,
where
there
can
be
credit
bidding,
which
is
what
the
--
which
is
what
the
respondent
would
like?
justice

well,
if
the
respondent
thought
that
what
the
judge
would
determine
would
indubitably
provide
the
indubitable
equivalent,
then
there
wouldn't
be
an
issue
here,
right?
the
reason
why
there's
an
issue
is
because
they
don't
think
that
what
the
judge
will
decide
will
indubitably
provide
the
indubitable
equivalent.

when
this
procedure
is
followed,
how
often
does
a
buyer
other
than
the
stalking
horse
obtain
the
property?

justice
samuel
a.
alito,

is
it
correct
that
really
the
heart
of
your
argument
is
that
the
real
value
of
this
property
is
greater
than
the
value
that
you
think
the
bankruptcy
court
would
assign
to
it
if
this
were
done
under
subsection
(iii)?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

why?
why
do
you
have
that
fear?

what
is
it
about
the
auction
--
what
is
it
about
the
auction
process
that
you
think
is
likely
to
produce
or
creates
an
unacceptable
risk
of
producing
a
valuation
that
is
--
that
is
too
low?
is
it
because
of
the
use
of
the
stalking
horse
or
--
or
what
is
it
about
the
process?
