mr.
david
m.
neff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
secured
creditor
must
be
allowed
to
credit
bid
when
its
collateral
is
being
sold
under
a
chapter
11
plan.
the
relevant
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code
plainly
says
no.
section
1129(b)(2)(a)
provides
that
a
chapter
11
plan
must
be
fair
and
equitable
to
a
secured
creditor
that
objects
to
it.
it
then
provides
three
alternatives
that
the
debtor
can
pursue
to
satisfy
that
test.
any
one
of
these
three
alternatives
can
be
used
when
assets
are
being
sold,
but
only
one
of
them
requires
the
right
to
credit
bid.
under
subsection
(i),
the
plan
must
allow
the
creditor
to
retain
its
lien
and
receive
payments
over
time,
with
the
present
value
equal
to
the
value
of
its
collateral.
under
subsection
(ii),
the
plan
must
allow
the
creditor
to
credit
bid
when
its
asset
is
being
sold
free
of
its
lien.
but
under
subsection
(iii),
the
plan
must
provide
the
creditor
with
the
indubitable
equivalent
of
its
secured
claim.
the
debtors
have
chosen
to
pursue
a
plan,
a
plan
sale
without
credit
bidding
under
subsection
(iii).
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
permits
that
result.
mr.
david
m.
neff
the
indubitable
equivalent
will
be
determined
at
the
time
of
plan
confirmation,
in
our
case
after
the
sale
has
been
conducted
although
not
yet
approved
by
the
court.
so
the
court
will
have--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--well,
here's
what
happens
typically.
the
debtor
files
a
motion,
as
we
did
in
this
case,
to
approve
bid
procedures.
the
court
then
determines
whether
those
bid
procedures
are
appropriate
for
the
sale.
the
sale
is
then
conducted.
then
the
debtor
goes
to
plan
confirmation;
and,
at
the
plan
confirmation
hearing,
aside
from
establishing
the
16
requirements
of
section
1129
for
a
plan
to
be
confirmed,
the
debtor
also
seeks
to
confirm
the
results
of
the
sale.
mr.
david
m.
neff
the
indubitable
equivalent
must
be
an
amount
that
is
at
least
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
secured
claim.
in
essence,
it's
going
to
be
determined
by
what
the
asset's
sold
for,
provided
that
the
sale
has
generated
the
best
possible
price
for
the
asset.
mr.
david
m.
neff
the
creditor
has
an
opportunity
at
the
plan
confirmation
hearing
to
raise
any
issue
with
regard
to
the
sale
process,
with
regard
to
the
auction
that
occurred,
has
the
opportunity
to
raise
any
other
issue
that
may
bear
on
the
price
that
is
received
at
the
sale
that
occurs.
for
instance,
it
could
say,
well,
they
conducted
this
auction,
but
i
have
an
appraisal
here
that
says
the
property
is
worth
much
more.
so
this
can't
possibly
be
--
my--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--well,
it's--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--it's
going
to
be
the
judge,
after
reviewing
what
happens
at
the
sale.
the
problem
with
allowing
a
creditor
the
right
to
credit
bid
under
all
circumstances
is,
in
a
case
like
ours,
we
don't
believe
we
will
ever
get
to
an
auction
because
no
one
else
will
show
up.
mr.
david
m.
neff
in
this
particular
instance,
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
the
creditor
simply
does
not
want
the
asset
sold.
it
would
rather
take
the
asset
back
and
hold
it
for
some
time
period.
so
it's
not--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--well,
what
they
bargained
for
was
that
the
asset
be
liquidated
and
all
of
the
proceeds
applied
to
their
loan.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
propose
to
do
under
our
sale
procedure.
mr.
david
m.
neff
well,
he
--
he
is
denied
that
right
under
subsection
(i),
which
is
our
traditional
reorganization,
internal
reorganization
provision
of
section
1129(b)(2)(a).
mr.
david
m.
neff
well,
with
regard
to
the
indubitable
equivalent,
clearly
the
judge
is
going
to
make
that
determination,
but
that's
no
different
than
the
judge
making
a
determination
under
subsection
(i)
as
to
what
the
fair
market
value
of
the
collateral
is
for
purposes
of
determining
the
note
that
the
creditor
is
going
to
receive
and
be
paid
off
over
time.
mr.
david
m.
neff
if
there
is
testimony
provided
to
the
judge
that
that
is
the
way
that
will
maximize
the
sale
proceeds
and
that
in
fact
you
can't
get
indubitable
equivalence
unless
you
allow
credit
bidding,
it
would
seem
to
me
under
that
circumstance
the
judge
would
have
that
discretion.
mr.
david
m.
neff
well,
the
problem
is
when--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--well,
i--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--your
honor,
i
would
disagree.
i
think
in
a
situation
like
ours,
no
one
else
is
going
to
come
to
bid,
because
creditors
who
are
--
or
potential
purchasers
who
are
looking
to
buy
a
hotel
have
multiple
opportunities
to
buy
other
hotels.
so
if
they
know
that
they
are
going
to
show
up
at
a
sale
where
a
creditor
is
owed
substantially
in
excess
of
what
the
property
is
likely
to
sell
for,
they
are
not
going
to
spend
their
time
and
effort
doing
the
due
diligence
that
is
required
to
acquire
or
make
a
bid
on
an
asset
like
a
hotel.
mr.
david
m.
neff
that
in
essence
would
be
denying
chapter
11
relief
to
a
host
of
debtors
where
their
collateral
is
worth--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--what
--
the
problem
is,
you
are
cutting
off
the
bankruptcy
process
really
before
it
has--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--your
honor--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--thank
you.
your
honor,
i
don't
see
subsection
(iii)
as
having
the
limiting
language
that
it
should
have
if
in
fact
it
was
meant
to
be
something
other
than
what
is
in
subsection
(i)
or
subsection
(ii).
there
is
no
language
that
says
except
as
provided
for
in
subsection
(i)
or
(ii).
relief
other
than--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--well--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--if
you
are
looking
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
creditor
saying
well,
this--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--okay.
mr.
david
m.
neff
i
agree,
and
there
are
other
parties
and
interests
in
a
bankruptcy
case,
including
obviously
unsecured
creditors,
that
get
nothing
if
the
result
is
all
the
creditor
gets
is
the
relief
from
the
automatic
stay
to
foreclose
on
the
collateral
when
you
have
this
great
discrepancy
between
what--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--well,
in
our
particular
instance
obviously
there
are
some
senior
liens
that
would
be
paid,
including
things
like
mechanic's
liens
and
real
estate
taxes.
there
are
other
costs
that--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--that's
true,
although
resolving
them
pursuant
to
a
plan
is
usually
a
better
resolution
for
them,
by
providing
more
certainty
and
--
with
regard
to
the
result,
and
a
more
quicker
resolution
usually,
as
opposed
to
being
relegated
only
to
state
court
to
fight
them.
in
our--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--i
was
only
going
to
say
that
in
our
particular
instance
the
stalking
horse
had
agreed
over
a
future
time
after
it
obtains
the
property
to
provide
for
recovery
to
general
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
david
m.
neff
subsection
(ii)
provides
that
if
you
allow
credit
bidding
regardless
of
the
price
that's
achieved,
that
that
is
deemed
to
be
fair
and
equitable
treatment
of
the
secured
creditor's
claim.
mr.
david
m.
neff
with
regard
to
justice
scalia's
question,
all
i
was
trying
to
point
out
is
that
in
subsection
(ii),
regardless
of
the
price
that
is
achieved
as
long
as
you
allow
the
secured
creditor
the
right
to
credit
bid.
mr.
david
m.
neff
that's
the
fair
and
equitable--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--the
secured
creditor
will
get
all
the
proceeds
from
the
property.
mr.
david
m.
neff
right.
with
regard
to
the
pavements
that
are
in
the
future,
those
are
after
the
--
the
sale
would
be
consummated
to
the
stalking
horse
bidder.
mr.
david
m.
neff
there
are
other
benefits
that
the
secured
--
that
will
get,
that
will
increase
the
--
the
price
that
is
received
by
having
sold
the
property
in
bankruptcy.
for
instance
when
you
sell
through
a
plan,
you
avoid
the
payment
of
transfer
taxes.
mr.
david
m.
neff
so
clearly
to
the
extent
that
the
transfer
taxes
being
saved
are
in
an
amount
that
ultimately
exceeds
what
ultimately
goes
to
the
unsecured
creditors,
these--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--it
would
be
our
obligation
to
show
at
confirmation
that
the
creditor
is
paying
the
top
dollar
for
the
asset.
if
the
creditor
desires
to
pay
a
bonus
or
a
premium
on
top
of
that,
we
would
have
to
show
that,
nonetheless,
that
the
secured
creditor
is
receiving
the
indubitable
equivalent
and
either
have
to
show
by
argument
that
--
a
savings
on
the
transfer
tax
or
some
other
way
that
this
is
not
causing
the
secured
creditor
to
not
receive
the
indubitable
equivalent.
mr.
david
m.
neff
sure.
mr.
david
m.
neff
is
your
question
why
we
always
have
it
under
section
363,
but
not
under
the
plan?
mr.
david
m.
neff
section
allows
the
sale
of
property
outside
the
ordinary
course
of
business
during
a
bankruptcy
case.
it
can
be
done
as
quickly
as
on
21
days
notice,
so
it
can
be
done
on
a
very
truncated
basis,
or
even
more
quickly
if
the
debtor
can
show
that
there
is
cause,
some
reason
to
have
an
even
faster
sale.
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
show
that
any
of
the
plan
requirements
in
section
1129
must
be
met.
so
there
are
good
reasons
to
have
this
protection
for
the
secured
creditor
when
you
are
selling
under
section
363
outside
of
a
plan
context
that
don't
necessarily
exist
when
you
are
selling
in
the
course
of
a
plan
because
a
plan
takes
a
much
longer
time
period,
usually
at
least
2
months
notice,
if
not
much
longer.
mr.
david
m.
neff
well,
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
case.
and
i
did
see
that
in
their
brief,
and
i
don't
know
the
extent
that
in
practice
that
actually
occurs
because,
for
instance,
they
pointed
out
the
sba
loans,
those
are
typically
guaranteed
loans.
so
there
would
be
a
motivation,
at
least
by
the
principals
of
the
debtor,
to
maximize
the
return
to
the
sba.
but
as
far
as
them
not
being
allowed
to
credit
bid,
there
are
--
they
have
the
opportunity
to
have
a
greater
voice
in
the
sale
process.
they
can
seek--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--well,
they
can
seek
from
the
bankruptcy
court
a
greater
role
when
the
asset
is
being
marketed
for
sale
to
ensure
that
they
are
receiving
top
dollar
on
their
claim.
mr.
david
m.
neff
well,
when
we
sell
assets
the
debtor
typically
has
the
control
over
how
it's
going
to
be
marketed
and
sold.
they
may
give
some
input
rights
to
the
secured
creditor,
but
they're
usually
not
going
to
give
the
secured
creditor
the
veto
power
over
how
to
conduct
the
sale.
but
i
would
suggest
that
when
you
have
a
situation
with
a
creditor
that
truly
cannot
bid
cash,
that
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
impress
upon
the
judge
that
they
need
to
have
a
greater
role
when
you
are
actually
marketing
and
selling
the
property.
mr.
david
m.
neff
right.
mr.
david
m.
neff
the
court
is
going
to
review
the
process
to
actually
sell
the
asset,
who
was
--
where
was
it
marketed,
who
knew
about
it,
who
showed
up
at
the
auction,
how
many
bids
were
made.
mr.
david
m.
neff
right.
mr.
david
m.
neff
there
has
been
no
closing.
the
closing
doesn't
occur
until
the
plan
confirmation
actually
occurs.
and,
in
fact,
that's
how
you
would
do
it
after
this
court's
ruling
in
2008.
mr.
david
m.
neff
no,
because
you
are
going
to
have
situations
where
creditors
--
secured
creditors
will
credit
bid
amounts
that
have
no
relationship
to
the
fair
market
value,
what
we
call,
for
instance,
loan-to-own
lenders,
where
their
only
interest
is
actually
getting
the
title
to
the
property.
so
you
are
going
to
have
situations
that
--
where
the
credit
bid
does
not
equate
to
market--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--the
problem
is
when
you
are
dealing
with
larger
assets,
like
what
we
are
dealing
with,
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
sophisticated
buyer
to
come
in
to
bid
against
a
lender
that
can
credit
bid,
particularly
in
a
situation
like
our
case,
where
the
lender
has
said:
i
simply
want
the
property
back.
mr.
david
m.
neff
well,
we
believe
that
--
that
subsection
(iii)
allows
us
to
show
that
the
secured
creditors
receiving
the--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
david
m.
neff
the
bankruptcy
judge
sees
this
in
a
variety
of
cases.
just
the
natural
tension
that
you
have
in
a
bankruptcy,
individuals
who
may
be
self-interested,
yet
they
are
supposed
to
be
fiduciaries
for
the
estate.
it's
part
of
our
roles
as
lawyers
to
be
the
fiduciaries
as
well.
our
particular
instance,
it's
not
a
concern
because
the
property
is
being
marketed
to
a
wide
array
of
people.
there's
no
requirement
that
they
keep
the
management
company,
and
there's
every
opportunity
for
any
other
hotel
company
to
come
in
or
any
other
strategic
buyer--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--interestingly,
the
process
actually
works
a
little
different
than
that.
debtors
will
go
out
and
their
financial
advisers
will
actually
go
out
and
try
to
market
the
ability
to
be
the
stalking
horse,
to
actually
try
to
get
the
best
stalking
horse
bid.
in
this
particular
instance
what
we
got
was
the
--
ultimately
the
$55
million.
we
are
confidently
the
property
ultimately
will
sell
for
more.
mr.
david
m.
neff
i
don't
know
from
a
statistical
basis.
and,
you
know,
a
stalking
horse,
if
they
have
the
--
a
break-up
fee,
they
have
that
built-in
cushion.
and
in
our
case,
i
would
point
out
the
judge
had
not
yet
approved
the
break-up
fee,
but
it
was
a
standard
3
percent
of
the
--
of
the
bid
price.
so
i
don't
know
what
percentage
it
is,
you
know,
from
my
own
experience.
mr.
david
m.
neff
the
stalking
horse?
mr.
david
m.
neff
yes.
mr.
david
m.
neff
that's
part
of
the
bid
procedures.
and
buyers,
more
sophisticated
buyers
and
when
you
deal
with
bigger
assets,
they're
used
to
the
process
being
this
way,
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
stalking
horse
and
that
there
is
going
to
be
some
sort
of
protection.
mr.
david
m.
neff
i
would
say
the
vast
majority
of
cases
occur
under
section
363,
where
there
is
no
question
because
of
363(k)
that
there
is
the
right--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--that
is
true.
the
major
difference
is
that
a
sale
under
section
363(k)
almost
invariably
the
secured
creditor
supports,
so
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
transaction
occurring,
whereas--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--when
you
are
selling
under
section
363,
because
of
363(k)
there
must
be
a
right
to
credit
bid;
and,
in
most
situations,
the
secured
creditor
wants
the
assets
sold
when
you
are
doing
a
section
363
sale.
so
there
is
no
question
in
the
minds
of
a
buyer
but
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
transaction,
and
there
is
a
reason
to
spend
your
time
and
effort
learning
more
and
doing
due
diligence
about
the
asset.
mr.
david
m.
neff
that's
correct.
and
--
and
it's
our
belief
that
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
the
ability
in
subsection
(iii)
to
conduct
the
sale
and
pay
the
secured
creditor
the
indubitable
equivalent
of
its
claim.
mr.
david
m.
neff
it's
going
to
be
measured
by
the
current
market
conditions,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
secured
creditor
brings
in
an
appraisal
that
will
invariably
be
based
on
what
the
projections
are
going
to
be
and
take
that
into
account.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
m.
neff
with
regard
to
the
market
valuation,
we
are
doing
a
market
valuation,
as
this
court
instructed
in
the
203
north
lasalle
case
from
1999,
by
having
an
auction,
and
after
that
auction
still
having
to
prove
up
that
we've
given
the
indubitable
equivalent
by
showing
what
occurred
at
that
auction.
and
if
the
lenders
would
like
to
bring
at
that
point
their
appraisals
and
show
that
we
didn't
achieve
that
amount,
then
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
satisfy
the
indubitable
equivalent
standard.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
role
that
subsection
(iii)
plays
in
subsection
(ii)--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--if
they
can--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--right.
the
question
--
it's
a
very
high
standard.
mr.
david
m.
neff
it's
a
very
high
standard.
and
as
long
as--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--if
it
is
a
creditable
appraisal
and
we
were
unable
to
achieve
that,
then
we
will
have
a
very
difficult
time
satisfying
that
standard;
but,
the
process
will
have
been
allowed
to
play
out,
which
is
extremely
important
because
those
of
us
who
have
done
debtor
work
know
how
many
times
a
lender
doesn't
want
to
do
something,
and
ultimately
you
have
a
sale
or
otherwise
some
sort
of
disposition
of
assets,
the
price
gets
high
enough,
and
they
are
willing
to
go
along
with
it.
so
with
regard
to
the
market
test--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--then
you
would
have
to
provide
additional
consideration
to
the
secured
creditor
to
get
it
to
the
level
that
the
judge
would
find
it
to
be
indubitable.
so
it's
no
different
than
at
any
plan
confirmation
hearing
if
you
say:
judge,
my
plan
is
dependent
upon
the
interest
rate
being
set
at
5
percent.
the
judge
says:
well,
i
find
it
should
be
6
percent.
you
have
to
find
a
way
to
bridge
that
gap.
mr.
david
m.
neff
it's
more
so
that
the
purchaser
would
have
to
come
up
with
that,
would
have
to
come
up
with
that
or
find
some
other
way
to
bridge
that
gap.
it's
not
really
a
waste
of
time
because
again
you
are
allowing
the
process
to
play
itself
out.
too
many
times
we
see
with
secured
creditors
they're
unwilling
to
deal
with
debtors
because
they
have
gotten
them
in
the
particular
situation.
and
then
when
you
are
able
to
actually
have
an
auction,
they
are
surprised
by
how
high
the
bidding
gets.
because
bankruptcy
auctions
are
very
fulsome
events
and
create
--
can
create
quite
a
lot
of
bidding
that
can
really
generate
very
high
--
high
value
for
the
property.
as
far
as
the
role
that
(iii)
plays
in
(ii),
it's
a
bit
convoluted;
but,
if
you
pursue
a
plan
sale
through
subsection
(ii),
you
don't
have
to
show
indubitable
equivalents
as
long
as
they
are
allowed
to
credit
bid.
but
if,
in
fact,
they
don't
credit
bid
or
they
are
topped,
and
you
are
able
to
raise
cash,
that
cash
must
be
treated
in
an
indubitable
equivalents
way
or
in
accordance
with
subsection
(i).
mr.
david
m.
neff
okay.
mr.
david
m.
neff
with
regard
to
what
courts
have
done
for
a
very
long
time,
for
the
30
years
that
have
been
referenced
have
been
primarily
in
section
--
with
regard
to
section
363
sales
as
opposed
to
plan
sales.
mr.
david
m.
neff
it's
also
difficult
in
a
bankruptcy
situation
to
keep
the
case
alive
long
enough
to
get
to
plan
confirmation,
particularly
if
it's
a
--
if
it's
a
business
that's
struggling
financially,
because
the
secured
creditor
has
an
ability
to
get
relief
from
the
automatic
stay.
so
that's
why
we
would
have
more
section
363
sales.
but
with
regard
to
the
benefit,
you
look
at
a
case
like
philadelphia,
or
a
case
like
the
pacific
lumber
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
allowed
an
entire
enterprise
to
be
restructured
out
of
a
very
positive
sale
of
the
timberlands,
that
would
not
have
occurred
if
in
fact
the
court
had
required
credit
bidding
because
the
lender
simply
would
have
taken
back
that
one
crucial
asset
around
which
the
entire
enterprise
was
restructured.
so
i
think
from
a
debtor's
perspective,
that
is
obviously
of
great--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--if--
mr.
david
m.
neff
--they
could
have
gone
under
(i)
if
in
fact
that
--
that
the
lender
would
have
been
precluded
from
making
a
section
1111(b)
election
and
also
precluded
from
credit
bidding,
because
credit
bidding's
not
required
under
subsection
(i),
and
an
1111(b)
election
does
not
apply
when
there
is
a
sale.
thank
you.
