ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--pardon
me?
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
is
a
big
case
for
the
government.
as
you
suggest,
the
government
is
in
the
position
of
--
that
actually
many
secured
creditors
are
in
these
days,
which
is
that
we
have
constraints
on
our
ability
to
cash
bid
at
the
sale
of
our
collateral
through
a
bankruptcy,
and
the
detailed
cramdown
provisions
of
chapter
11
are
designed
to
protect
the
rights
of
secured
creditors.
the
essence
of
being
a
secured
creditor,
of
course,
as
the
court
has
suggested,
is
that
the
secured
creditor
has
bargained
for
the
right
either
to
get
its
money
back
or
to
get
the
thing
that
secures
its
loan,
to
get
its
collateral.
and
the
type
of
sale
that
is
contemplated
in
clause
(ii)
of
section
1129(b)(2)(a)
is
precisely
designed
to
guarantee
that
the
creditor
will
get
the
benefit
of
its
bargain.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
in
most
chapter
11
cases
the
u.s.
trustee
doesn't
play
a
role
because
it's
a
debtor
in
possession,
and
so
the
trustee
is
not
in
charge
of
the
property
of
the
estate.
the
debtor--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--where
the
--
where
the
united
states
is
a
creditor.
that
--
that's
true.
but
if
there's--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--the
trustee
is
there,
but
if
the
debtor
proposes
a
plan
that
wouldn't
allow
the
united
states
to
credit
bid
at
an
auction
that
is
selling
its
collateral,
then
the
united
states
is
usually
out
of
luck
because
the
antideficiency
act
prevents
us
from
bidding
cash.
now,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
one
--
one
sort
of
assumption
that
has
seemed
to
permeate
the
conversation
here,
which
is
that
a
secured
creditor
will
always
have
an
incentive
to
bid
the
full
amount
of
its
claim
at
an
auction
of
its
assets
where
the
auction
is
supposed
to
be
free
of
liens.
that
is
actually
not
true.
as
my
friend
ms.
maynard
suggested,
unless
a
bank
is
trying
to
get
into
the
business
of
running
a
hotel
or
running
whatever
business
is
the
collateral,
the
creditor
will
only
want
to
take
the
property
if
it
thinks
it
can
make
a
profit
by
then
turning
around
and
selling
the
property.
so
if
there
is
an
auction
where
there
is
a
cash
bid,
and
the
creditor
thinks
that
the
value
of
--
the
amount
of
the
cash
bid
is
actually
a
fair
valuation
of
the
property,
the
creditor
has
no
incentive
to
bid
higher
than
that
in
credit,
because
it
has
no
expectation
of
getting
more
money
than
that
when
it
then
takes
the
property
and
turns
around
and
sells
it.
so
allowing
the
credit
bidding
won't
have
the
effect
of
serving
as
a
veto
on
what
would
be
a
fair
sale
price
by
a
cash
bidder.
the
secured
creditor's
incentive
is
only
to
bid
up
to
what
it
--
up
to
what
it
views
as
the
value
of
the
property
and
not
a
penny
more,
because
it's
not
trying
to
take
the
property
just
for
the
property's
sake.
in
most
cases
it
wants
to
take
the
property
and
then
sell
the
property.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
mean,
it
has
more
flexibility
because
it
has
already
put
up
its
money.
but
every
bidder
has
that
incentive
that
you
suggest,
which
is
to
try
to
make
that
it's
--
to
sort
of
game
the
system
a
little
bit
and
--
and
make
everybody
put
their
money
where
their
mouth
is.
the
congress
gave
secured
creditors
a
right
to
have
a
role
where
they
get
to
put
their
money
where
their
mouth
any
time
there
is--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--absolutely.
and
--
and
petitioner
is
certainly
correct
that
the
phrase
"indubitable
equivalent",
an
unusual
phrase
in
the
statute,
that
that
phrase
is
broad
enough
to
cover
any
type
of
disposition
of
a
secured
creditor's
claim,
including
the
sale
of
property
free
of
liens.
but
congress
also
enacted
two
much
more
specific
provisions
right
next
to
clause
(iii),
and
in
those
provisions,
number
(i),
which
governs
--
governs
the
retention
of
liens
on
--
on
collateral,
and
number
(ii),
which
the
sale
of
--
the
sale
of
collateral
free
of
liens,
there
are
very
specific
protections
written
into
clauses
(i)
and
clause
(ii).
and
this
court's
interpretive
canon
that
a
specific
provision
will
trump
a
more
general
provision
where
both
could
apply
would
seem
clearly
to
apply
here.
if
a
plan
proposes
a
disposition
of
a
claim
that
is
addressed
by
a
clause
(i)
or
a
clause
(ii),
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
allow
them
to
strip
out
protections
that
are
provided
in
those
clauses
by
purporting
to
go
under
the
more
general
standard
of
indubitable
equivalent.
that
is
especially
true
because
the
type
of
judicial
valuation
of
the
property
that
would
take
place
under
petitioners'
type
of
scheme
is
not
guaranteed
to
make
sure
that
the
creditor
gets
what
it
bargained
for,
which
is
either
its
money
or
its
property,
but
that
is
exactly
what
clause
(ii),
that
type
of
auction,
is
guaranteed
to
do.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
the
type
of
sale
contemplated
in
clause
(ii)
is
essentially
a
liquidation
of
the
secured
creditor's
lien
on
a
property.
and
so
you
--
the
sale
would
essentially
liquidate
the
lien
and
then
clause
(ii)
provides
that
--
that
there
would
need
to
be
a
replacement
lien
on
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
that
replacement
lien
would
then
have
to
be
treated
under
clause
(i)
or
clause
(iii).
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
in
most
situations
what
happens
is
that
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
are
handed
over
to
the
secured
creditor,
which
is
essentially
a
clause
(iii)
treatment
of
the
lien
on
the
proceeds,
in
the
sense
that
if
the
lien
on
the
proceeds
is
a
lien
on
the
pile
of
cash,
if
you
hand
over
the
pile
of
cash,
you're
surrendering
the
collateral
that
is
securing
that
lien,
which
is
the
classic
example
of
indubitable
equivalent.
that
is
one
of
the
examples
cited
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
judge
hand's
opinion
in
in
re
murel.
i
think
one
of
the
assumptions
that
permeates
petitioners'
brief
is
that
valuation
--
that
the
value
of
collateral
is
something
we
can
all
know
and
agree
upon.
but
valuation
is
an
inherently
difficult
undertaking,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
congress
enacted
the
code
in
1978
it
shifted
the
preference
to
move
from
judicial
valuation
towards
market
valuations.
and
here
congress
in
clause
(ii)
expressed
its
view
that
--
that
the
type
of
market
that
would
value
this
property
would
include
one
of
the
most
interested
market
participants,
who
is
--
which
is
the
secured
creditor
who
has
an
interest
in
the
property.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
they
--
they
definitely
do.
but
i
think
here
congress
provided
that
this
would
be
a
situation
where
the
secured
creditor
would
have
a
role
in
valuing
the
property,
and
even
under
--
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out,
even
--
i
think
it
was
justice
kagan
--
under
clause
(i)
the
judge
has
a
role
in
valuing
the
property
because
we
have
to
determine
the
present
day
value
of
the
cash
stream
that
the
creditor
would
be
owed.
but
as
judge
--
as
my
friend
ms.
maynard
pointed
out
--
maybe
she
will
be
a
judge
some
day--
[laughter]
--the
creditor
in
that
situation
has
a
role
in
--
in
protecting
itself
against
undervaluation
because
it
can
make
the
1111(b)
election,
retain
the
full
amount
of
its
claim
if
it
wants,
and
--
and
protect
itself
going
forward.
i
think
one
way
that's
important
is
that
it
protects
--
it
prevents
debtors
from
cashing
out
creditors
at
a
low
value,
at
a
point
where
--
in
the
market
where
the
value
of
the
property
is
low,
because
they
retain
the
lien
for
the
full
amount.
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
if
this
is
a
particularly
low
point
in
the
market
and
the
creditor
is
trying
to
sell
the
property
at
auction
--
i'm
sorry
--
b-the
debtor
is
trying
to
sell
the
property
at
auction,
the
creditor
can
come
in
and
take
the
property
and
realize
any
--
any
upside
down
the
road.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
thank
you.
