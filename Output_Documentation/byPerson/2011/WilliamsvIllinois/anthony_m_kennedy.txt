justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
abbinanti
testified
that
she
did
the
blood
test
and
it
went
into
the
state
database
with
reference
to
the
other
crime,
not
this
crime;
am
i
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
she
is
an
expert,
she
testified
how
she
did
the
test,
and
what
the
--
and
that
she
put
the
dna
result
into
--
into
the
data
bank?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
she
goes
further.
she
says:
"and
based
on
that"
--
which
i
believe
to
be
true;
she
didn't
say
that,
but
this
is
the
implication
--
"based
on
that",
which
i
believe
to
be
true,
"this
belongs
to
williams".
this
dna
is
williams'
dna.
and
if
she
weren't
relying
on
the
truth
of
the
assertion
from
cellmark,
it
would
be
irrelevant
for
the
jury.
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
saying
that
the
state
of
illinois
case
is
weaker
here
than
in
melendez,
where
they
had
a
certificate,
and
in
bullcoming,
where
they
had
somebody
from
the
lab
testify
as
to
lab
procedures.
here
they
had
neither
and
yet
illinois
somehow
says
it
comes
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
the
--
the
chain
of
custody
are
just
supporting
actors.
the
key
actor
in
the
play,
the
hamlet
in
the
play,
is
the
person
who
did
the
test
at
cellmark.
and
she
or
he
is
not
here.
and
if
you
want
to
say,
oh,
this
is
not
--
tell
the
jury
--
now,
we're
not
saying
that
this
is
admitted
for
the
truth.
we're
not
saying
that
this
is
williams'
dna.
the
judge
would
say,
well,
then
it
is
irrelevant.
it's
excluded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me,
in
--
as
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
not
--
not
only
does
he
indicate
that
this
is
hard
to
distinguish
from
bullcoming,
in
bullcoming
at
least
you
had
an
expert
say
how
the
laboratory
works.
here,
you
don't
even
have
that.
you
have
less
here
with
reference
to
cellmark
than
you
did
in
bullcoming.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
bullcoming,
we
said
that
was
not
sufficient.
and
in
that
case,
the
person
was
from
that
lab.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
how
that's
any
different
from
bullcoming
and
melendez-diaz.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
you
had
something
more
than
you
have
here.
and
therefore,
it
goes
out
and
this
comes
in?
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
limited
purpose
of
--
of
explaining
the
basis
for
her
opinion.
but
her
opinion
is
that
this
is
matched
to
lambatos.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
her
opinion
is
that
this
is
a
match
to
lambatos.
but
if
--
if
the
match
material
isn't
admitted
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted,
or
isn't
--
considered
for
the
matter
asserted,
then
that
testimony
is
irrelevant
and
meaningless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
--
if
that's
so,
why
isn't
there
insufficient
evidence
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
none
of
--
none
of
which
has
anything
to
do
with
the
accuracy
of
the
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
understand
our
precedents,
would
this
have
been
a
stronger
or
a
weaker
case
if
a
representative,
and
employee
of
cellmark
had
come
and
said
although
i
didn't
do
this
sample,
i
want
to
tell
you
how
our
procedures
worked
and
why
we
are
a
respectable
lab,
etcetera,
etcetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
aware
that
in
illinois
they
have
an
instruction
--
assuming
it
was
a
jury
case,
this
is
a
bench
case,
but
if
it
were
a
jury
case,
"ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
are
not
to
presume
or
assume
that
the
dna
tested
by
cellmark
came
from
this
sample.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
they
routinely
give
that
to
juries?
