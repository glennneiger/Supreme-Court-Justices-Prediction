justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
just
show
that
the
material
went
to
and
came
back
from
the
lab.
it
wouldn't
show
what
the
lab
results
were.
it
was
the
results
that
she
testified
to,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
other
evidence
was
there
of
the
results
besides
her
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
utterly
irrelevant,
would
it
not,
if
the
statements
were
not
true?
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
for
an
expert
to
testify
about
a
hypothetical,
you
know:
assuming
this,
this,
this,
mr.
expert,
what
would
the
result
be?
well,
on
those
assumptions
it
would
be
this.
but
this
was
not
--
nobody
asked
--
asked
her
to
assume
those
things
at
all.
she
testified
that
--
that
she
had
a
match
between
what
she
had
done
and
what
had
been
done
on
the
--
on
the
dna
of
this
individual
by
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me
quite
different
from
the
--
from
the
ordinary
hypothetical
put
to
an
expert.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not
objecting
to
hearsay,
are
you,
counsel?
you
are
objecting
to
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
quite
different
from
what
--
what
mr.
wigmore
was
writing
about,
which
was
hearsay.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
said
the
contrary,
though,
haven't
we?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
breyer
dissented
from
those
opinions.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
just
justice
breyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
up
to
the
prosecutor
which
of
those
12
he
wants
to
bring
in,
whether
he
wants
to
bring
in
all
12
or
just
one.
if
he
thinks
the
jury
will
be
sufficiently
persuaded
by
bringing
in
just
one,
he
can
bring
in
just
one,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
has
to
bring
in
the
one
and
not
hearsay
about
what
the
one
would
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
didn't
she
say,
i
relied
on
stuff
that
i
received
from
caremark
--
whatever
the
name
of
the
lab
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
said:
i
relied
on
material
that
was
a
swab
containing
the
dna,
the
sperm
of
this
particular
individual.
and
she
did
not
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
didn't
just
say:
i
got
something
back
from
the
lab
and
i
relied
on
whatever
that
said.
no,
she
said
what
she
had
gotten
back
from
the
lab,
and
she
did
not
know
of
her
personal
knowledge
that
it
was
what
she
said
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
didn't
know
if
they
had
incompetent
people
there.
the
last
case
we
had
involving
this
kind
of
an
issue,
the
reason
they
didn't
bring
in
the
lab
technician
to
testify
was
that
he
had
been
fired
in
the
interim
for
some
reason
which
we
didn't
know.
but
it
was
pretty
clear
why
he
would
not
have
been
a
very
good
witness.
we
don't
know
how
good
this
lab
was.
we
don't
know
how
good
the
individuals
who
did
the
test
were.
and
that's
why
it's
up
to
the
state
to
bring
forward
testimony
saying
what
the
lab
did.
and
the
only
testimony
they
brought
forward
was
the
testimony
of
this
witness
who
was
not
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
she
said
that
--
i
would
agree
with
you.
but
she
said
more
than
that.
she
said
i
relied
on
material
provided
by
cellmark
which
is,
and
then
she
described
what
that
material
was.
and
she
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
cellmark
says
"this
is
the
male
dna
that
was
found
in
the
sample
that
was
sent.
"
cellmark
made
that
decision,
right?
and
her
testimony
was
based
upon
the
fact
--
was
based
upon
comparing
that
male
dna
with
her
own
blood
sample.
it's
meaningless
unless
that
male
dna
was
indeed
the
defendant's.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
--
i
would
believe
that
if
the
prosecution
put
the
question
to
her
this
way:
"assume
that
you
got
a
report
which
said
that
this
was
the
defendant's
dna.
"
"and
if
you
were
to
match
that
with
the
--
this
--
the
work
you've
done
on
the
blood
sample,
would
you
find
that
--
that,
you
know,
that
the
sample
was
taken
from
the
defendant?
"
and
she
would
say
"yes".
and
the
jury
would
say
"so
what"?
i
mean,
you've
just
--
you've
just
made
a
hypothesis.
"if
you
had
been
told".
that
--
that
would
be
worth
nothing.
her
testimony
was,
i
received
information
that
this
was
indeed
the
dna
taken
from
--
the
male
dna
taken
from
the
--
from
the
swab
that
was
sent.
without
that,
the
testimony
was
worthless.
it's
just,
you
know,
a
hypothesis.
she
--
she
responds
to
a
hypothesis.
that's
not
the
way
this
was
played
out
in
the
trial,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
she
was
asked,
just
--
just
to
be
clear
what
she
was
testifying
to:
"did
you
compare
the
semen
that
had
been
identified
by
brian
hapack
from
the
vaginal
swabs
of
latonia
jackson
to
the
male
dna
profile
that
had
been
identified
by
karen
kooi
from
the
blood
of
sandy
williams?
"
"yes,
i
did".
she
is
accepting
and
--
and
affirming
this
statement
that
what
she
was
comparing
was
the
semen
that
had
been
identified
from
the
vaginal
swabs.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
that
seems
to
me
extra
--
i
mean,
we
have
a
confrontation
clause
which
requires
that
the
witnesses
against
the
defendant
appear
and
testify
personally,
and
--
and
the
crucial
evidence
here
is
the
testing
of
the
semen
found
on
the
swab.
that
is
--
that's
the
crux
of
this
evidence,
and
you're
telling
me
that
this
confrontation
clause
allows
you
to
simply
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
bring
in
the
person
who
did
the
test;
we
are
simply
going
to
say,
this
is
a
reliable
lab.
i
don't
know
how
that
complies
with
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
instruction
here?
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
we
simply
have
a
presumption
even
though
--
even
though
the
court's
statement
seems
to
indicate
that
he
does
take
it
for
the
truth
of
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying,
well
he
couldn't
have
because
that
would
be
against
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
deference
given?
i
mean
it's
either
the
fact
or
its
not
the
fact.
if
the
state
supreme
court
opinion
says
something
that
contradicts
the
--
you
know,
the
record
we
owe
a
deference,
i
don't
know
of
any
such
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
owe
deference
to
its
interpretation
of
illinois
law,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we
should
give
it
deference
where
deference
is
due
and
not
give
it
deference
where
deference
is
not
due.
and
on
statement
of
facts
that
are
either
erroneous
or
not,
i
don't
know
why
deference
is
applicable.
