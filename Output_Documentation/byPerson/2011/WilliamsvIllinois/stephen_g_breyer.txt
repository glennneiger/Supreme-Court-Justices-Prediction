justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
would
have
thought
--
yes.
you
can
--
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
going
to
agree
with
that.
[laughter]
--i
know.
i
mean,
i'm
sure
you've
looked
at
this.
the
most
--
one
of
the
more
interesting
things
i've
found
in
these
briefs
were
the
references
to
wigmore.
so
i
went
back
and
read
what
wigmore
said
about
scientific
evidence,
expert
evidence,
and
business
records.
and
he
certainly
concedes
and
agrees
with
justice
scalia,
and
those
opinions
are
filled
with
hearsay.
i
mean,
there
is
no
expert
who
isn't
relying
on
what
his
teachers
told
him
in
college,
which
reflect
dozens
of
out-of-court
statements
given
to
dozens
of
people
who
wrote
them
up
in
books.
so
expert
opinion
is
always
built
on
hearsay,
almost,
and
--
and
so
are
business
records;
they
are
filled
with
hearsay.
but
wigmore
writes
a
treatise,
doesn't
he,
where
he
says
exceptions
have
been
recognized
since
the
17th
century
or
earlier
to
cover
that
kind
of
material?
so
my
question
for
you
is
why
shouldn't
we
recognize
a
similar,
related
kind
of
exception
here?
we
are
trying
to
discover
the
meaning
of
"testimonial".
the
difference
here
is
a
police
lab
or
a
lab
that
reports
to
a
police
lab,
the
individuals
there
probably
know
that
there
is
a
fairly
good
chance
that
what
they
say
will
be
used
in
a
criminal
trial.
they
don't
know
it
for
sure,
but
they
are
controlled
by
the
canons,
by
accreditation,
by
tests
of
reliability,
by
the
fact
that
they
are
not
normally
interested
in
the
results
of
the
trial,
as
here
they
couldn't
care
less;
they
don't
even
care
if
it
is
used
in
the
trial.
and
all
the
wigmore
factors
for
both
exceptions
could
support
a
similar
exception
here,
which
would
have
the
following
virtue:
it
would
have
the
virtue
of
not
requiring
ten
people
to
come
in
and
testify,
whom
the
defense
is
of
course
free
to
call;
and
it
would
also
have
the
virtue
of
removing
the
temptation
for
prosecutors
to
stop
relying
on
the
more
reliable
evidence,
dna,
and
instead
encourage
them
to
rely
on
the
less
reliable
evidence,
namely
the
eyewitness
testimony
in
a
case.
now,
that
--
that
really
is
all
my
questions
in
one.
because
i
understand
every
argument
you
are
making
--
fitting
it
in
with
hearsay,
i
agree
with
that.
and
i
also
agree
to
a
degree
with
the
testimonial
point.
and
i
see
the
need
for
an
exception
and
wigmore
provides
all
the
reasons,
and
since
we
are
incorporating
that
word
"testimonial"
don't
we
have
the
power
and
why
shouldn't
we
create
one
out
of
the
word
"testimonial"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'll
go
further
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
wigmore
actually
believed
that
the
confrontation
clause
simply
encapsulated
the
hearsay
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
you
the
question,
and
i
--
i
will
go
further
in
your
direction.
i
will
go
further.
saying
this:
because
i
would
say,
what
about
that
not
only
do
we
recognize
the
exception,
but
it
isn't
a
full
exception;
that
if
the
defendant
can
show
some
reason
to
believe
that
either
the
laboratory
is
not
properly
accredited,
it
isn't
doing
things
properly;
or
that
the
individual
technician
has
something
personal
or
knows
about
--
about
the
defendant
that
makes
it
suspect,
immediately
the
presumption
that
the
exception
applies
disappears,
and
the
prosecutor
has
to
call
the
--
the
witness.
you
can
say,
well,
we
shouldn't
make
that
up,
but
i
believe
if
you
go
back
to
the
18th
century
you
will
discover
that
your
interpretation
of
the
confrontation
clause
was
not
there.
so
--
so
that's
what's
basing
my
question,
and
i
would
like
your
reaction.
it's
a
long
question,
concerns
an
exception,
and
i
would
like
you
to
give
me
your
reaction
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
mean
it,
because
i
see
extending
those
cases
from
one
individual
from
a
laboratory
being
familiar
with
the
results
to
requiring
in
ordinary
cases
the
calling
of
what
could
be
up
to
ten
technicians.
i
see
that
as
making
a
sea
change
in
normal
criminal
law
practices,
and
my
motive
is
as
i
said:
i
fear
it
will
push
the
system
in
the
direction
of
relying
on
less
reliable
eyewitness
testimony
rather
than
more
reliable
technical
laboratory
dna-type
evidence.
now,
you
have
my
--
i
have
made
the
point,
and
i
really
want
to
get
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true
whenever
--
whenever
an
expert
--
an
expert
makes
a
statement,
there
is
a
conceptual
difference
between
their
testifying
to
something
out
of
court
for
its
truth
and
that
being
the
basis
for
the
expert
opinion.
in
the
one
case
she's
relying
upon
a
statement
in
order
to
form
her
opinion
and
in
the
other
case
she
is
introducing
the
statement.
and
you
are
saying
in
this
case
that's
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
isn't
that
what's
going
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
still
there
is
the
conceptual
difference.
and
as
long
as
there
is
that
conceptual
difference,
don't
we
have
a
basis
from
distinguishing
this
case
from
melendez?
