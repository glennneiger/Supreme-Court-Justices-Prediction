justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
it
hasn't
been
the
focus
of
the
briefing,
but
you've
just
made
it
the
focus
here.
i
know
that
you
have
been
claiming
that
her
statements
about
what
constituted
the
cellmark
lab
results
are
a
statement
that
violates
the
confrontation
clause.
but
are
you
taking
the
position
that
her
statements
and
the
admission
of
the
documents,
mailing
the
lab
sample
to
the
laboratory
and
them
getting
it
back,
that
all
of
those
business
records
were
improperly
admitted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
she
testified
that
in
her
records
she
sees
that
her
lab
--
and
she
says
--
i
think
those
records
were
produced,
i
could
be
wrong
--
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
were
produced
and
admitted
into
evidence.
that
the
lab
sample
taken
from
the
victim,
l.j.,
was
mailed
to
the
laboratory,
and
that
it
came
back.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
those
shipping
documents
were
not
business
records?
are
you
taking
the
position
that
those
were
improperly
admitted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
on
your
theory
of
this
case,
i
think
you
say
first
it's
not
a
statement;
and
second
that
if
it
is
it
was
not
offered
for
the
truth.
under
your
theory,
if
this
lab
technician
had
introduced
cellmark's
report,
that
would
have
been
okay,
because
it
wasn't
offered
for
the
truth.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
changing
the
facts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
your
theory,
she
could
have
introduced
the
lab
report?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
meaning
the
fact
that
you
didn't
physically
introduce
the
report
makes
a
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
she
testified
that
she
reviewed
lab
samples.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
matched
the
defendant.
so
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
saying;
i
have
the
report
in
my
hand;
and
i
match
that
report
with
the
williams
report,
and
this
is
my
conclusion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
she
said
that:
cellmark
said
this
is
l.j.'s
vaginal
swab
dna.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
she
said
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
justice
kennedy's
question
about
bullcoming?
could
the
expert
in
bullcoming
have
said,
as
one
of
the
amici
here
said,
that
all
they
would
have
had
to
do
in
bullcoming
is
to
read
or
to
give
a
report
that
gave
the
blood
alcohol
content,
the.5
or.10
or
whatever
it
was,
and
have
an
expert
come
in
and
say,
that
number
shows
he's
drunk.
is
that
any
different
from
this
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
the
only
part
of
his
expertise
is
the
report
says
point.10;
i'm
not
offering
it
for
the
truth;
i'm
assuming
that
that's
true;
then
he
was
legally
drunk.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
has
done
nothing.
all
the
report
did
was
give
a
number.
and
the
supervisor
comes
in
and
says
that
number
violates
--
is
legal
drunkenness.
how
is
that
different
from
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right,
but
you're
not
telling
me
why
that's
not
the
same
here
because
what
this
expert
said
is,
the
cellmark
report
is
from
this
victim
so
it's
the
same
set
of
numbers
as
in
bullcoming.
now
he's
taking
a
step
and
saying,
instead
of
legal
drunkness,
it
matches
someone
else's
that
i
took.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but,
mr.
dreeben,
she
did
repeat
what
cellmark
said.
i
asked
your
--
the
state's
attorney
whether,
if
she
had
read
the
data
report
from
the
laboratory
analysis,
would
that
have
been
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause?
i'm
not
clear.
she
says,
only
if
you
admitted
it.
but
in
fact
that's
what
she
did.
if
you
read
her
testimony
--
i
give
you
an
example
at
page
79
--
she
tells
on
cross-examination
exactly
what
the
steps
were
in
the
cellmark
report,
what
numbers
they
gave,
and
she
tells
and
explains
--
she
--
the
state's
attorney
took
pride
in
this
--
she
said
i
disagree
with
that
number
that
they
came
up
with.
i
think
the
number
should
be
--
so
she's
really
reading
the
report.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
then
let's
--
all
right.
so
let's
get
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
the
state
have
done
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
dreeben,
if
no
expert
from
either
lab
came
in,
if
an
expert
had
the
cellmark
information
and
the
illinois
state
police
information,
not
offered
for
the
truth
of
the
matter,
and
came
in
and
said
i
match
this
and
i
match
that,
and
it's
the
defendant
--
could
that
have
been
done?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
saying
that
we
owe
no
deference
to
the
illinois
supreme
court's
judgment
on
this
evidentiary
issue?
and
if
so,
no
deference,
tell
me
what
proposition
of
law
supports
that
or
are
you
saying
deference
is
due
but
we
shouldn't
give
it.
which
of
the
two
positions
do
you
take?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
i'm
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
there
is
an
illinois
requirement
that
the
trial
judges
give
the
instruction
he
described?
