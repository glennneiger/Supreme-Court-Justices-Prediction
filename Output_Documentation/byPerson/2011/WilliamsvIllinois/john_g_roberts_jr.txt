chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-8505,
williams
v.
illinois.
mr.
carroll.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
just
because
the
photographing
is
something
that
people
wouldn't
dispute.
i
mean,
what
if
the
state
presents
testimony
saying:
i
took
the
sample;
i
put
it
in
the
sample
case;
i
sent
it
to
cellmark
saying,
give
us
a
dna
analysis
of
this
sample;
we
got
back
from
cellmark
the
analysis
with
the
same
name
on
it;
and
the
expert
testifies,
i
compared
it
to
dna
from
the
defendant
and
it
was
a
match.
you
would
be
free
in
cross-examining
to
say:
do
you
know
what
they
did
at
cellmark?
and
she
would
say:
well,
they
are
a
dna
lab;
we
asked
them
to
do
a
dna
analysis.
but
do
you
know
what
happened?
no,
i
don't.
as
far
as
you
know,
did
they
ignore
it
and
not
do
anything?
well,
yeah,
i
didn't
--
i'm
not
testifying
to
what
happened
at
cellmark.
i
am
telling
you,
we
sent
the
dna
there,
and
this
is
what
we
got
back.
why
is
that
not
perfectly
fine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
did
not
--
she
does
not
say
that.
she
said:
we
sent
the
sample
marked
"crime
scene"
or
whatever
it
was.
we
got
back
a
data
sheet
that
said
"crime
scene".
well,
expert,
do
you
know
that
they
didn't
mix
them
up?
no,
i
don't.
all
i
know
is
what
we
sent
and
what
we
got
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
all
the
witness
is
--
all
the
witness
is
testifying
to
is
what
they
sent
and
what
they
got
back.
and
you
are
free
to
cross-examine
about
what
went
on
at
cellmark,
and
a
jury
is
free
to
say,
well,
i
believe
the
circumstantial
evidence
about
what
happened.
or
defense
counsel
can
say,
why
don't
they
have
anybody
here
from
cellmark,
and
the
jury
can
say,
well,
yeah,
that's
a
good
point.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
nobody
from
cellmark
is
testifying,
and
that's
what
you
are
objecting
to,
but
they
don't
need
that
testimony
to
present
the
expert's
conclusion
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
alvarez.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
though.
it
could
have
--
could
it
have
a
witness
saying
cellmark
is
the
nation's
foremost
dna
testing
laboratory;
they
hire
only
people
who
have
ph.d.
's
in
dna
testing?
i
mean,
is
that
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
can
make
its
case
a
lot
stronger--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
carroll,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
do
think
our
law
has
established
though
that
a
jury
will
follow
an
instruction
in
this
situation
to
--
not
to
take
the
testimony
for
truth
of
the
evidence,
for
truth
of
the
matter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have
any
case
saying
that
instruction
is
inadequate
in
a
case
like
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
