justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
hasn't
it
long
been
accepted
that
experts
may
testify
to
the
facts
that
form
the
basis
for
their
opinions
on
the
ground
that
when
the
experts
go
over
those
facts
they
are
not
--
that
information
is
not
being
introduced
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted,
the
truth
of
those
underlying
fact;
only
that
those
are
the
facts
that
the
expert
has
relied
on
in
reaching
an
opinion?
and
that
has
not
been
considered
to
be
hearsay.
now,
do
you
argue
that
those
--
that
that
is
incorrect,
those
--
those
statements
cannot
be
testified
to
by
an
expert
without
their
--
their
constituting
either
hearsay
or
testimony
within
the
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
say
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--let
me
put
it
this
way.
let's
say
the
expert
--
people
from
the
--
the
expert
testifies:
i
received
the
--
i
looked
at
the
report
from
--
from
the
lab;
i
looked
at
the
report
from
--
from
--
i
looked
at
the
report
from
cellmark,
the
outside
lab;
i
looked
at
the
report
that
we
did;
and
there
--
there
is
a
match.
and
so
the
expert
is
--
is
mentioning
facts
that
form
the
basis
of
the
opinion
but
not
testifying
to
the
truth
of
those.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause
at
that
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
ten
is
not
--
ten
is
not
a
far-fetched
hypothetical.
we
have
an
amicus
brief
from
the
manhattan
district
attorney's
office
and
the
new
york
city
chief
medical
examiner's
office,
and
they
say
that
their
very
fine
crime
lab
involves
at
least
12
technicians
in
the
analysis
of
dna.
they
break
it
down
that
way
because
it
increases
accuracy,
it
decreases
the
chance
of
any
favoritism
for
the
prosecution,
and
they
say
that:
is
impossible
for
us
to
bring
all
12
of
those
technicians
into
court
to
testify
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
dna
evidence;
and
if
we
have
to
do
that
we
will
just
not
be
able
to
use
dna
evidence
in
court;
we
will
have
to
rely
on
less
reliable
evidence.
is
that
just
a
--
do
you
think
that's
just
a
practical
consequence
that
we
have
to
accept
under
crawford?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
will
bringing
in
one
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause
problem?
if
12
people
perform
steps
in
the
analysis
and
one
person
testifies
about
what
11
other
people
did,
don't
you
have
the
same
confrontation
clause
problem?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that
not
a
testimonial
statement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
person
were
in
court,
the
person
would
say:
this
is
what
i
did.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that's
not
testimony?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
did
the
illinois
appellate
court
say
about
that,
about
whether
the
information,
whether
the
evidence
was
admitted
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
justice
kagan's
question
there
the
correct
question?
isn't
that
a
question
of
illinois
evidence
law,
not
a
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there
sufficient
foundation
laid
for
the
introduction
of
the
expert's
testimony?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
was
addressed
by
the
illinois
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
types
of
evidence
that
are
--
that
are
involved
here.
one
is
chain
of
custody
evidence.
was
the
result
that
--
that
was
sent
back
the
result
that
was
done
on
the
sample
that
was
sent
to
cellmark?
that's
just
purely
chain
of
custody.
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
--
the
accuracy
or
the
professionalism
of
what
was
done
at
cellmark.
and
she
did
make
a
statement.
she
did
say
that
the
sample
--
that
the
result
that
came
back
from
cellmark
was
--
was
done
--
was
based
on
a
test
of
the
vaginal
swab
that
was
sent
there.
the
other
has
to
do
with
what
cellmark
did,
how
well
they
did
it.
she
didn't
say
anything
about
that.
now,
as
to
the
chain
of
custody,
if
that's
testimonial,
isn't
--
isn't
it
simply
duplicative
of
the
very
strong
circumstantial
evidence
regarding
the
chain
of
custody
--
the
sending
of
it
out
with
certain
markings,
and
the
receipt
back
with
certain
markings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
rule
703
of
the
illinois
rules
of
evidence,
are
the
facts
that
an
expert
takes
into
account
in
reaching
his
or
her
opinion
introduced
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
first
case
is
williams
versus
illinois,
number
10-8505.
this
case
involves
dna
evidence
and
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
petitioner,
sandy
williams
was
convicted
in
state
court
in
illinois
for
abducting,
raping,
and
robbing
a
young
woman.
at
his
trial,
the
victim
identified
williams
as
her
attacker
and
the
state
also
attempted
to
show
that
williams'
dna
matched
the
forensic
sample
obtained
from
the
victim
at
the
hospital
after
the
rape.
williams
subjected
to
the
testimony
by
the
dna
expert
who
testified
for
the
state.
after
petitioner
was
convicted,
he
filed
an
appeal
claiming
that
the
dna
expert's
testimony
violated
the
confrontation
clause.
the
state
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
argument
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
anyone
interested
in
understanding
the
court's
holding
will
have
to
read
our
opinions.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy,
and
justice
breyer
join.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kagan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
ginsburg
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
