ms.
anita
alvarez
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
ms.
anita
alvarez
--the
cellmark
report
was
not
introduced
as
evidence--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--and
if
she
had--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--if
we
offered
her
--
the
cellmark
report
into
evidence
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted,
it
would
be
a
different
situation.
ms.
anita
alvarez
the
--
ms.
lambatos
testified
consistent
with
the
confrontation
clause
here.
she
testified--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--as
an
expert.
ms.
anita
alvarez
she
did
not
parrot
the
cellmark
report,
as
we
have
seen
in
bullcoming.
she
did
not
testify
that
cellmark
said
this
was
the
defendant's
profile,
that
cellmark
said
this
was
a
match.
she
did
much
more.
ms.
anita
alvarez
right.
ms.
anita
alvarez
because
the
vaginal
swab
that
was
taken
from
the
victim
--
and
there
was
a
chain
of
custody
here
and
proper
foundation
that
was
laid
--
the
vaginal
swab
that
was
taken
from
the
victim
--
and
this
bore
out
through
the
business
records
that
came
in
on
the
shipping
manifest--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--if
the
expert
in
bullcoming
did
more
than
what
he
simply
did
in
bullcoming
and
that
was
just
simply
read
the
report
and
testify
that
that's
what
that
lab
did,
if
he
actually
did
his
own
independent
analysis
based
on
his
expertise,
based
on
his
skill--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--if
he
were
--
if
he
were
to
give
his
independent
opinion,
based
on
his
analysis
and
what
he
had
done,
then
we
would
have
seen
a
situation
closer
to
this.
ms.
anita
alvarez
if
that
report
is
being
used,
is
being
offered
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--but
no
--
what
happened
here
is
ms.
lambatos
testified
based
on
--
and
gave
her
own
independent
expert
opinion
based
on
her
skills,
her
knowledge,
her
expertise.
she
relied--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--but
an
expert
can
always
testify
about
the
material
that
they
relied
on,
whether
that
material
is
ever
admitted
into
evidence
and
sometimes
that
material
could
never
be
admitted
into
evidence.
but
she
in
fact
testified
to
what
she
relied
on,
in
addition
to
what--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--cellmark.
ms.
anita
alvarez
she
testified
that
she
relied
on
those
materials
and
she
can
testify--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--she
knew
from
the
procedures
and
the
chain
of
custody
and
the
shipping
manifest
that
what
was
sent
initially
to
cellmark
after
preliminary
tests
were
done
at
the
illinois
state
police
crime
lab
showing
the
presence
of
sperm
that
it
was
sent
to
cellmark
and
it
was
analyzed
at
cellmark
and
came
back--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--the
testimony
of
ms.
lambatos
satisfies
the
confrontation
clause
because
she
is
the
witness
against
the
accused
in
this
case,
and
the
fact
that
she
testified
that
she
relies
on
material
that
was
generated
by
cellmark
does
not
make
cellmark
the
witness
against
the
accused.
ms.
anita
alvarez
she
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
that,
and
that
came
through
during
this
cross-examination.
ms.
lambatos
was
subjected
to
a
very
--
quite
lengthy
and
a
quite
--
a
specific
cross-examination.
ms.
anita
alvarez
right.
the
--
the
chain
of
custody
was
--
was
strong
--
was
strong
in
this
case;
the
evidence
that
was
presented
through
the
shipping
manifest,
through
the
other
witnesses
that
testified
in
this
case.
the
--
the
fact
that
ms.
lambatos
testified
that
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
they
did
at
cellmark,
again,
as
an
expert,
she
was
able
to
talk
about
what
material
she
relied
on,
the
cellmark
materials.
the
cellmark
materials--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--but
the
matching--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--ms.
lambatos
did
testify
both
on
direct
examination
and
cross-examination
that
cellmark
was
an
accredited
lab.
the
illinois
state
police
crime
lab
routinely
uses
out
--
outsourcing--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--but
--
but
ms.
lambatos
--
we
never
introduced
any
cellmark
reports
in
this
case.
there
were
no
testimonial
statements
conveyed
through
her
testimony.
there
were
no
out-of-court
statements
used
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
what
was
presented
was
the
expert
opinion
of
ms.
lambatos,
who
was
a
duly
qualified
expert
in
--
in
forensic
biology,
in
dna.
and
not
only
did
she
have
the
ability
to
look
at
the
cellmark
material,
she
interpreted
the
material
that
--
that
came
from
cellmark.
and
what
came
from
cellmark,
the
electrophoretogram,
i
would
submit
to
you
is
not
testimonial;
it's
a
machine-generated
chart
that
to
the
naked
eye
to
a
trier-of-fact
means
absolutely
nothing
unless
an
expert
actually
interprets
that.
and
ms.
lambatos
testified
to
how
she
interpreted
that.
she
talked
about
the
alleles--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--well,
i
--
well,
melendez-diaz,
what
we
had
in
melendez-diaz
was
in
fact
a
certificate,
an
affidavit.
it
was
--
it
was
created--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--no,
i
think
in
melendez-diaz,
it's
clear
because
that
was
--
that
report
was
drafted,
created,
for
the
primary
purpose
of
being
used
as
substitute
of
live
testimony.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
cellmark
reports
were
not.
the
electrophoretogram,
again,
which
would
--
needs
expert
interpretation;
the
allele
chart
--
again,
i
would
submit
is
not
testimonial,
that
those
reports
were
not
created
in
lieu
of
live
testimony.
and
ms.
lambatos
looks
at
that,
she
interpreted
it.
in
fact,
she
even
said
that
there
was
something
on
the
electrophoretogram
that
she
didn't
agree
with
cellmark
on.
it
was
a
certain
one
piece
that
was
higher
that
she
felt
was
just
in
her
expert
opinion
background
noise.
so--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--well,
i
--
i
believe
if
--
if
the
state
had
tried
to
introduce
that
cellmark
report--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--it
would
have
been
offered
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
and
we
--
and
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
--
it
would
implicate
the
confrontation
clause.
ms.
anita
alvarez
--but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
ms.
anita
alvarez
right.
i
think
--
the
key
is
the
use.
how
were
these
statements
used?
how
were
these
reports
used?
and
in
this
particular
case,
they
were
not
used
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
they
were
used
for
the
limited
purpose
of
explaining
the
expert's
opinion,
and
for
the
expert
to
testify
to
what
she
relied
on
in
getting
to
her
opinion--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--there
is.
and
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
172,
the
language
from
the
trier-of-fact,
he
says
just
that,
that
he's
considering
these
for
the
limited
purpose.
in
fact,
the
illinois
appellate
court
also
affirmed,
state
--
stating
that
this
evidence
came
in
for
a
limited
purpose,
as
well
as--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--well,
not
irrelevant,
but
i
believe
it
goes
to
the
weight
of
her
testimony.
and
that
is
for
the
trier-of-fact
to
determine.
and
here,
it
was
a
bench
trial
with
a
judge.
but
if
in
fact
the
state
presents
the
evidence
in
the
way
that
was
--
we
presented
it
here,
we
are
always
taking
the
chance
that
it
would
weaken
the
--
the
case.
and
it
has
to
be
considered
for
the
weight
to
be
given
to
ms.
lambatos'
testimony--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
no.
i
believe
there
was
testimony
of
the
victim
in
this
case,
who
identifies
this
defendant
as
the
perpetrator
in
this
rape.
and
in
addition,
the
judge
made
a
finding
in
his
ruling,
the
trier-of-fact
said
he
believed
her
100
percent,
and
he
found
her
extremely
credible--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--well
then,
we
probably
would
have
problems
with
the
illinois
evidentiary
rules,
and
--
and
the
law
in
illinois.
we
obviously
presented
in
this
case
a
sufficient
chain,
a
sufficient
foundation,
to
show
where
--
when
that
--
we
presented
the
testimony,
not
only
of
the
victim,
but
the
doctor
who
was
present
when
the
swab
was
taken,
of
the
officers
who
brought
the
sealed
swab
to
the
illinois
state
police
crime
lab,
how
that
sealed
swab
was
first
looked
at,
preliminary
tests
by
mr.
hapack
in
isp,
in
order
to
--
before
they
sent
it
to
cellmark,
and
as
cellmark
extracts
a
dna
profile
of
a
woman
--
a
female
and
a
man.
cellmark
never
makes
the
match
here.
cellmark
never
says,
mr.
williams'
dna>
["].
that
is
done
by
ms.
lambatos,
through
her
experts
and
her
expertise.
she
makes
the--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--and
she
can
testify
to
what
she
relied
on.
again
--
and
it
goes
to
her
weight
if
the
trier-of-fact
chooses
not
to
believe
it.
the
--
but
the
evidence
here
was
clear--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--yes,
the
--
again,
our
position
is
that
her
testimony
was
consistent
with
the
confrontation
clause.
the
confrontation
clause
is
concerned
about
what
statements
are
admitted,
what
evidence
is
admitted.
no
cellmark
reports
were
admitted
here.
she
did
not
parrot
the
testimony
--
i
mean,
the
report
of
cellmark.
she
testified
to
what
she
did,
how
she
arrived
at
her
own
independent
opinion
on
this,
which
again,
we
did
not
offer
any
out
of
court
statements
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
we
offered
ms.
lambatos
who
was
subjected
to
a
lengthy
cross-examination,
and
that
satisfies
the
confrontation
clause,
and
the
inability
to
tested
the
reliability
of
what
happened
at
cellmark
does
not
trigger
the
confrontation
clause.
ms.
anita
alvarez
well,
i
think,
you
know,
what
we
saw
in
bullcoming
was
not
an
independent
opinion
of
an
expert.
it
was
--
he
offered
no
independent
analysis.
he
simply
read
off
a
report
that
was
prepared
by
another
lab,
and
that
--
in
bullcoming
that
was
offered
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
we
did
not
offer
cellmark
reports
here
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
we
offered
the
expert
opinion
of
ms.
lambatos,
and
her
credibility
was
attacked
through
a
very
vigorous
cross-examination
here,
and
that
satisfies
the
confrontation
clause.
the
testimonial
statements
again
are
--
are
statements
that
are
--
are
made
in
lieu
of
live
testimony,
and
the
key
is
the
live
testimony
here,
which
we
presented
live
testimony.
the
reports
from
cellmark
in
our
--
in
our
conclusion
is
that
they
are
not
testimonial
in
nature;
and
what
petitioner
is
asking
you
here,
to
do
here
today
is
to
expand
crawford,
to
expand
the
confrontation
clause,
to
expand
the
definition
of
hearsay
and
the
definition
of
testimonial.
and
--
and
our
position
simply
is
to
ask
you
to
maintain
the
rule
of
crawford
which
is
quite
clear,
that
a
--
a
witness
becomes
--
an
out-of-court
declarant
becomes
a
witness
again
and
--
accuser
--
within
the
context
of
confrontation
clause
when
their
extrajudicial
statements
are
offered
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
and
so
the
witness
here--
ms.
anita
alvarez
--no.
ms.
anita
alvarez
no.
and
so
our
--
our
position,
your
honors,
is
to
maintain
the
rule
of
crawford.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
inferential
hearsay,
as
the
petitioner
want
you
to
believe.
a
statement
is
a
statement.
hearsay
is
hearsay.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
inferential
hearsay.
what
was
presented
here
in
this
case
was
consistent
with
the
confrontation
clause;
it
was
satisfied;
and
for
--
and
for
that
we
respect
your
opinion
here
today,
but
we
ask
that
you
maintain
the
ruling
of
crawford.
ms.
anita
alvarez
she
--
she
is
accepting
and
she
is
relying
on
the
material
that
was
generated
by
cellmark,
but
again,
the
state
did
not
admit
into
evidence
or
--
or
--
or
try
to
admit
into
evidence
the
cellmark
report
or
any
statements
from
cellmark.
