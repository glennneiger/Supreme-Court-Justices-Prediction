mr.
brian
w.
carroll
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
sandra
lambatos
testified
that
mr.
williams'
dna
matched
a
dna
profile
that,
according
to
assertions
made
by
analysts
from
a
cellmark
lab,
was
the
genetic
description
of
the
purported
offender.
because
no
one
from
cellmark
appeared
at
mr.
williams'
trial,
lambatos'
testimony
conveying
the
testimonial
statements
from
cellmark
violated
mr.
williams'
rights
under
the
confrontation
clause.
for
these
reasons
the
illinois
supreme
court's
decision
should
be
reversed.
ms.
williams'
--
or
ms.
lambatos'
testimony
on
direct
examination
clearly
conveyed
cellmark's
statement.
she
testified
that
the
vaginal
swab
and
blood
sample
from
the
victim
were
sent
from
--
to
cellmark
for
dna
analysis.
she
later
was
asked,
was
there
a
computer
match
generated
from
the
male
dna
profile
found
in
the
semen
from
the
vaginal
swabs
of
the
victim
and
the
male
dna
profile
that
had
been
identified
as
having
originated
from
mr.
williams.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
as--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--the
shipping
records
were
produced.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
your
honor,
at
this
stage
we
are
not
challenging
the
admission
of
the
shipping
record.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
there
was
no
other
evidence.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
the
--
the
person
who
tested
or
who
analyzed
mr.
williams'
blood
did
testify
live
at
trial.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
when
he
was
arrested
for
an
unrelated
matter.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
in
this
case,
where
the
--
where
the
basis
evidence
that
the
expert
testifies
to,
where
it's
--
the
expert's
opinion
depends
on
those
statements
being
considered
true,
in
those
instances
then,
yes,
we
are
arguing
that
the
confrontation
clause
does
not
allow--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--right.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
if
the
--
if
the
expert
is
not,
you
know,
asserting
that
the
statements
are
true,
then
no.
however,
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
lambatos--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--that's
correct.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
i
was
just
going
to--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--well,
your
honor,
the
confrontation
clause
guarantees
the
defendant
to
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
witnesses
against
him,
and
that's
the
reason
why
this
court
should
not
make
an
exception--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--that's
right.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
crawford
and
melendez-diaz
and
bullcoming
largely
foreclose
on
making
such
an
exception.
the--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--yes,
on
this
record,
your
honor,
the
--
the
statements
that
were
produced
were
the
statements
of
the
authors
of
the
report.
so--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--i
believe
there
are
two
signatories
to
the
report.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
your
honor,
because
even
in
the
worst
case
scenario
described
in
the
new
york
county's
brief,
not
all
12
people
in
that
situation
make
testimonial
statements
and
not
all
12
people's
testimonial
statements
are
presented
at
trial.
the
confrontation
--
for
the
confrontation
clause
to
be
satisfied,
it
is
only
those
witnesses
who
the
prosecution
chooses
to
present
at
trial
who
must
testify.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
your
honor.
again,
it's
who's
testifying.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
we
don't,
because
the
question
is
whose
statement
is
being
presented.
now,
given
the
five
steps
in
the
brief,
the
electrophoresis
step,
the
person
who
does
the
dna
typing
and
determines
what
alleles
are
present
in
the
sample,
that
person
probably
has
to
testify
because
that's
really
what
the
results
are,
what
alleles
are
present.
amplification
step,
the
person
who
copies
the
dna
and
tags
it,
i
don't
think
that's
a
testimonial
statement;
and
in
this
case,
no
statements
from
someone
who
did
that
was
presented.
next
step,
quantification--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--well,
just
performing
a
test
is
not
a
testimonial
statement.
i'm
just
stating--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--if
the
person
was
in
court--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--in
that
case,
it
would
be
testimony.
however,
that
person
doesn't
have
to
testify
in
order
for
the
state
to
present
its
evidence.
if
the
state
chooses
to
present
that
person's
testimonial
statement
at
trial,
then
yes,
the
confrontation
clause
would
require
them
to
present
that
testimony
live.
however--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
it's
a
confrontation
clause
issue
because
the
prosecution
presented
the
statement
of
the
person
who
did
the
analysis
on
the
victim's
vaginal
swabs.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
well,
you
are
missing
something,
your
honor.
and
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
never
stated
he
was
not
considering
the
evidence
for
the
truth.
no
place
in
the
record
does
have
--
does
the
trial
judge
state
that.
and
in
fact,
in
the
finding
of
facts,
he
states
he
is
convinced
of
the
--
that
there
was
a
match
because
the
evidence
from
the
experts
established
that
the
victim
--
that
williams'
semen
was
found
on
the
victim,
and
in
the
notes
it
said
that,
well,
cellmark
was
an
accredited
lab.
if
he
wasn't
considering
cellmark's
statements
for
the
truth,
he
wouldn't
care
if
they
were
accredited.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
the
appellate
court
held
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law
these
statements
considered
--
statements
that
serve
as
the
basis
of
an
expert's
opinion
are
generally
deemed
not
to
be
admitted
for
their
truth.
however,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
considering
cellmark's
statements
to
--
you
know,
in
assisting
in
the
evaluation
of
lambatos'
testimony
and
considering
it
for
the
truth.
if
the
statements
weren't
true,
then
lambatos'
testimony
would
not
link
williams'
dna
to
the
crime.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
no,
your
honor.
the
question
here
isn't
whether
the
state's
evidence
was
sufficient.
it's
whether
the
evidence
the
state
did
present
violated
mr.
williams'
rights
under
the
confrontation
clause.
now
this
--
i
can
give
an
example
or
an
analogy.
suppose
a
police
officer
were
to
testify:
a
witness
gave
me
this
photograph
and
told
me:
this
is
a
photograph
of
the
offender.
i
compared
this
photograph
to
a
photograph
of
the
defendant.
i
found
that
they
match.
now,
the
police
officer,
he
compared
the
photographs.
you
know,
we
are
not
contesting
lambatos'
match.
but
the
statement
that
this
is
the
photo
of
the
offender,
that's
not
the
officer's
statement.
that's
a
statement
of
the
witness
who
gave
him
that
photograph.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
because
that
person's
testimony
that
the
results
we
got
back
were
connected
to
the
samples
we
sent--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--your
honor,
i
still
believe
that
would
be
a
confrontation
clause
violation
because
the
writing
on
the
data
sheet
that
said
"crime
scene",
a
person
at
cellmark
had
to
write
that
down
on
the
data
sheet.
so
someone
from
cellmark
was
making
a
representation
that
that
data
sheet
was
connected--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--well,
your
honor,
hypothetically
the
state
could
--
i
believe
the
state
could
present
its
evidence
through
circumstantial
evidence,
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
lambatos
did
testify
that
--
she
didn't
simply
state
that:
i
got
a
profile
back.
she
testified:
"i
got
a
profile
that
was
a
male
dna
profile
found
in
the
semen
from
the
vaginal
swab.
"
that's
a
statement
from
cellmark.
that's
not
lambatos'
statement.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
had
--
had
cellmark's
statement
been
presented
in
the
report
itself,
the
report
being
admitted
itself,
i
think
there
would
be
no
question
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
clause
under
melendez-diaz
and
bullcoming.
the
fact
that
the
same
statements
were
coming
in
for
the
same
evidentiary
reason
through
the
live
testimony
of
lambatos
shouldn't
change
that
situation.
it's
the
same
statements
coming
in
for
the
same
reason.
if
there
is
any
more
questions--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
it
was
state
cited
page
7
or
--
172
in
the
joint
appendix
as
a
reference
to
the
trial
judge
stating
that
he
was
not
considering
cellmark's
statements
for
its
truth.
that's
not
a
cite
to
the
transcript
of
the
trial.
that's
a
cite
to
the
illinois
supreme
court's
opinion.
nowhere
in
the
actual
trial
transcript
did
the
judge
ever
state,
"i'm
not
considering
this
evidence
for
its
truth.
"
in
fact,
in
the
statement
of
fact
on
page
jjj
151
of
the
record,
he
states
that,
it's
the
testimony
of
the
experts
that
makes
this
link.
cellmark's
an
accredited
lab.
and
it's
inconceivable
that
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
of
cellmark's
work
that
the
prosecution
presented
through
lambatos's
testimony
and
during
defense
counsel's
objection
to
that
testimony,
that
the
judge
would
never
state
at
any
point,
"hey,
i'm
not
considering
this
for
its
truth.
"
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
i
think
deference
is
due
but
you
shouldn't
take
it
given
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
well,
if
the
court--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--i
guess
i
--
if
this
court
would
like
not
to
give
the
illinois
supreme
court
deference,
i
would
be
more
than
happy--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
not
in
this
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
not
in
this
particular
fact
pattern.
but
this
case
is
different
than
a
bruton
type
situation
where
there
are
--
there
is
the
proper
way
to
consider
the
evidence
and
an
improper,
and
there
is
a
fear
that
the
jury
is
going
to
--
or
the
trier-of-fact
is
going
to
consider
the
improper.
here
illinois
law
did
allow
the
trier-of-fact--
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
--yes,
your
honor.
there
is
such
an
instruction
in
illinois
law;
however.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
i
believe
they
do,
your
honor.
however,
in
this
case
--
or
illinois
law
does
not
prohibit
the
trier-of-fact
from
considering
cellmark's
statement.
the
trier-of-fact
is
allowed
and
is
expected
to
consider
it
in
assisting
the
trier-of-fact
in
evaluating
lambatos's
opinion.
and
in
this
situation,
where
lambatos
is
--
the
only
way
that
the
cellmark
statement
supports
lambatos's
opinion
is
if
they
are
true,
there
is
no
meaningful
difference
between
considering
the
statements
in
assessing
lambatos's
opinion
and
considering
them
for
the
truth.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
i
believe
there
is
a
recommended
jury
instruction
for
--
that
the
basic
evidence
is
not
to
be
considered
for
its
truth,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
w.
carroll
not
under
the
language
of
the
rule,
your
honor,
no.
