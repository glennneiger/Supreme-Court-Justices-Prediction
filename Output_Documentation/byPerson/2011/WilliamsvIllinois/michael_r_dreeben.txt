mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
sandra
lambatos'
testimony
really
has
to
be
analyzed
as
having
two
components
to
it.
the
first
component
is
the
match,
the
match
between
the
data
reflecting
the
allele
charts
from
cellmark,
and
the
data
that
was
produced
in
analyzing
petitioner's
blood.
as
to
that
component
of
her
testimony,
she's
a
live
witness,
she's
subject
to
cross-examination.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
asserts
there
is
a
confrontation
clause
issue.
but
as
several
members
of
the
court
have
pointed
out,
that
testimony
is
entirely
irrelevant
and
nonprobative
unless
it
can
be
linked
to
the
semen
that
was
taken
from
the
victim
and
that
was
subsequently
analyzed
to
generate
a
dna
profile.
as
to
that
issue,
illinois
state
law
provides
that
her
testimony
cannot
prove
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted
what
cellmark
did.
she
cannot
repeat
on
the
witness
stand
when
she
gives
the
basis
for
her
testimony
things
that
cellmark
said
and
have
them
be
taken
for
the
truth.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
first
of
all,
justice
sotomayor,
that
did
come
in
on
cross-examination
and
i
don't
think
that
petitioner
is
contending
evidence
that
he
himself
elicits
on
cross-examination
would
violate
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
can
i
focus
on
--
on--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--can
i
focus
on
your
question?
i
think,
because
she
clearly
did
link
the
dna
that
she
compared
to
the
blood
dna
to
the
semen
that
was
sent
to
cellmark,
and
i
think
that
several
members
of
the
court
raised
the
question
is
she
implicitly
thereby
repeating
what
cellmark
said
and
then
making
cellmark
the
out-of-court
witness.
my
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
as
a
matter
of
illinois
state
law,
she
could
not
do
that.
she
is
not
permitted
to
give
the
basis
for
her
opinion
in
that
respect
and
have
it
taken
for
the
truth.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
this
brings
me
to
my
second
reason
for
saying
that
this
is
not
a
confrontation
clause
problem.
it's
in
essence
what
the
chief
justice
describes
and
what
justice
alito
referred
to
as
the
circumstantial
way
in
which
the
fact
finder
can
infer
that
cellmark
tested
the
dna
in
the
semen
that
was
sent
to
it.
there
is
a
shipping
manifest
that
shows
that
the
semen
goes
out
to
the
lab;
there
is
a
shipping
manifest
that
shows
that
it
comes
back.
and
cellmark
tenders--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
and
that
is
i
think
the
crucial
point
here.
the
state
may
have
a
very
weak
case
if
it
doesn't
produce
a
witness
from
the
lab
who
can
attest
to
the
fact
that
the
lab
did
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
and
conducted
a
properly
authorized
dna
examination.
it
has
to
get
by
with
the
very
skimpy
circumstantial
showing
of,
we
sent
the
material
out--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
it
did
that
here
by
saying
that
cellmark
is
an
accredited
laboratory
and
sandra
lambatos
participated
in
designing
proficiency
examination.
but
she
had
to
admit
on
cross-examination
that
she
had
no
idea
what
cellmark
actually
did
in
this
case.
she
could
draw
inferences.
and
the
inferences
that
she
drew
are
what
enabled
her
to
say,
my
opinion
is
there
is
a
match
between
the
dna
in
the
semen
and
the
dna
in
the
blood.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
have
been
relatively
stronger
had
a
witness
been
able
to
actually
come
from
cellmark
and
validate
that
cellmark
is
an
accredited
laboratory
and
conducts
procedures
in
a
certain
way.
but
the
crucial
point
here--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--only
if
as
a
matter
of
state
law
there
was
a
sufficient
foundation
for
the
fact
finder
to
conclude
that
the
dna
actually
came
from
the
blood
and
the
dna
came
from
the
semen.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
confrontation
clause,
justice
scalia,
does
not
obligate
the
state
to
present
a
strong
case.
it
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
presenting
a
relatively
weaker
case,
so
long
as
it
does
not
rely
on
testimonial
statements
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
this
court
held
in
bruton
v.
united
states
that
there
is
a
very
narrow
exception
to
the
almost
invariable
presumption
that
juries
will
follow
the
instructions
that
they
are
given.
if
they
are
told
not
to
take
evidence
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted,
they
are
presumed
to
follow
that
instruction.
here
illinois
state
law
supplies
that
filter.
everything
that
the
judge
heard,
he
filtered
through
illinois
state
law
that
says
the
basis
for
the
expert's
opinion
doesn't
prove
its
truth.
so
the
state
gave
up
the
right
to
say,
"you
can
believe
that
this
dna
report
is
reliable
and
trustworthy
because
cellmark
says
so.
"
the
state
doesn't
get
that
benefit;
and
as
a
result
of
not
getting
that
benefit,
it
is
not
obligated
to
treat
cellmark
as
if
it's
a
witness.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
think,
justice
kagan,
when
you
consider
the
things
that
this
court
has
held
juries
can
properly
apply
limiting
instructions
to,
they
can
hear
the
fact
that
evidence
was
seized
from
the
defendant,
marijuana
was
found
at
his
house.
the
defendant
gets
up
on
the
stand
and
says,
no,
it
wasn't.
the
state
can
introduce
that
marijuana
to
impeach
his
testimony,
and
the
jury
is
instructed:
you
may
not
use
that
as
proof
that
he
possessed
marijuana,
only
to
impeach
his
testimony.
the
same
is
true
with
unwarned
statements
in
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
no
instruction
here,
justice
scalia,
because
this
is
a
bench
trial.
and
in
a
bench
trial,
the
judge
is
presumed
to
follow
the
law,
and
as
my
colleague
read
to
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well
the
only--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
illinois
supreme
court
found
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
he
did
comply
with
state
evidentiary
rules
and
he
did
not
take
the
cellmark
report
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
and
there
is
in
this
case
an
alternative
route
of
proof
which
is
circumstantial,
and
i
take
the
chief
justice's
amendment
of
my
description
of
the
facts
to
include
that
cellmark
is
an
accredited
laboratory.
that
does
add
to
the
probative
value.
but
it
is
a
much
weaker
chain
of
support
to
conclude
that
the
dna
male
profile
came
from
the
semen
than
if
they
had
produced
cellmark.
but
not
having
produced
cellmark,
they
do
not
need
to
afford
confrontation
on
cellmark.
