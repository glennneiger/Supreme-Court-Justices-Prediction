in
the
case
of
the
blood
that
was
tested
in
the
police
lab,
there
the
person
who
tested
did
testify
at
the
trial,
right?
it
wasn't
just
lambatos
--
lambatos,
but
the
one
who
had
tested
the
blood?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
carroll,
are
we
talking
about
ten
witnesses?
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
just
one
witness,
from
cellmark.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
one
person,
not
ten.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
independent,
and
i
don't
--
you
said
that
in
your
brief.
i
don't
understand
how
lambatos'
testimony
can
be
independent
of
the
test
results
supplied.
i
mean,
it's
based
on
the
test
results.
it
can't
be
independent
of
them
because
it
is
entirely
dependent
on
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
report
had
been
introduced,
the
cellmark
--
the
cellmark
report,
it
would
be
testimonial;
is
that
--
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
does
it
become--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
does
it
become
non-testimonial
when
it's
relayed
by
the
recipient
of
the
report?
i
mean,
if
--
if
the
matters
are
being
introduced
for
the
truth,
then
it's
not
relevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
earlier
recognized
that
her
--
her
opinion
could
not
be
independent
of
the
test
results;
it
depended
entirely
on
the
test
results.
so
i
--
now
you
--
you've
inserted
independence
again,
and
i
thought
you
had
--
you
had
given
up
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
illinois
--
does
illinois
have
notice
and
demand?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
does
not.
