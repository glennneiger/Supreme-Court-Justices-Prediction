mr.
carroll,
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out
--
this
out,
and
i'm
--
here's
my
question:
suppose
you
had
two
witnesses,
one
from
--
one
who
had
done
the
lab
analysis
on
mr.
williams
and
one
who
had
done
the
lab
analysis
from
the
victim.
and
they
both
testified.
and
now
an
expert
comes
in,
and
the
expert
says:
i've
looked
at
both
reports
and
there's
a
match.
now
there
would
be
no
problem
at
all
with
that;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
now
we
only
have
one
of
the
lab
technicians
and
we
take
away
the
other
lab
technician.
and
what
you
are
saying
is,
well,
now
we
have
this
expert
and
she's
saying
she
could
do
a
match,
but
the
question
is:
a
match
of
what?
that's
the
question,
right?
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
is
that
a
confrontation
clause
issue?
why
isn't
it
just
that
the
prosecutor
has
failed
to
prove
an
element
of
his
case?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
is
that
right?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
judge
here
said:
no,
i'm
not
taking
this
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted;
i'm
only
taking
your
statements
about
the
lab
tests
as
an
indication,
as
the
basis
for
your
opinion.
so
i'm
listening
to
your
opinion.
the
problem
is
in
this
whole
case
there
has
been
no
factual
testimony
about
what
the
results
were
from
the
swab
on
the
victim.
isn't
that
right?
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
elena
kagan
how
--
how
do
we
know
that,
ms.
alvarez?
is
there
a
statement
from
the
finder
of
fact,
the
trial
judge
here,
that
he's
understanding
her
testimony
to
be
not
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted?
what's
the
best
evidence
that
that's
what
the
court
was
thinking?
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
the
state
had
not
presented
evidence
of
the
shipments,
so
that
you
didn't
even
have
that.
would
--
at
that
point,
should
the
judge
have
just
thrown
out
the
case?
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
guess
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
if
there's
no
evidence
in
the
case
that
the
--
that
the
match
is
to
the
victim,
where
is
your
case?
justice
elena
kagan
i
suppose
the
problem
is,
mr.
dreeben,
that
if
the
state
put
up
ms.
lambatos
and
ms.
lambatos
had
to
say:
i
did
a
match
--
i
was
given
two
reports;
there
is
a
match,
but
i
have
no
idea
where
this
other
report
came
from.
you
know,
it
might
have
been
from
the
victim
but
it
might
not
have
been.
i
don't
have
a
clue.
the
state
would
never
have
put
that
prosecution
on,
because
the
state
would
have
understood
that
there
was
no
case
there.
the
state
is
relying
on
the
fact
that
people
will
take
what
ms.
lambatos
says
about
what
she
knows
about
where
the
report
came
from
as
a
fact,
as
the
truth
of
the
matter,
that
in
fact
this
report
did
come
from
the
victim.
given
instructions
saying:
and
so
the
jury
can
be
you
can't
consider
this
except
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
but
it's
a
bit
of
a
cheat,
no?
