we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-704,
messerschmidt
v.
millender.
mr.
coates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
--
i
suppose
one
new
feature
of
the
case
is
the
fact
that
these
officers
submitted
the
affidavit
to
their
superiors,
who
were
--
were
attorneys.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
have
we
addressed
that
in
a
prior
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whose
house
--
whose
house
was
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
not
the
defendant's
house?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
was
just
going
to
say,
of
course
you
are
making
the
case
somewhat
harder
for
yourself
because
the
issue
here
is
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
him
to
say,
let
me
check
and
see
what
my
superiors
say
about
this,
and
then
after
that
review
for
him
to
say,
let's
see
what
the
magistrate
thinks
about
this,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
say
apply
protectively
or
correctly?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wolfson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
malley
involved
a
search
warrant
based
solely
on
a
wiretap
in
which
an
unknown
individual
discussed
drug
use
at
a
party.
that
was
all.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
lot
more
information
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here
you
had
a
police
officer
who
assembled
information
he
had,
truthful
information,
in
the
affidavit,
submitted
it
to
his
superiors,
who
were
lawyers.
then
it
was
submitted
to
the
magistrate,
who
was
a
judge.
and
what
you
have
to
say,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
a
reasonably
competent
officer
--
not
objective
good
faith
or
anything
like
that
--
a
reasonably
competent
officer
would
say:
you
know,
i
know
the
lawyers
in
the
office
said
this
was
okay
and
i
know
the
judge
said
it
was
okay,
but
i
know
more
than
them;
i
know
not
only
that
it's
not
okay,
but
it's
so
clearly
not
okay
that
i
shouldn't
have
qualified
immunity.
that
seems
to
me
a
pretty
heavy
burden
to
put
on
--
to
put
on
the
cop
on
the
beat.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
been
talking
--
we
have
been
talking
about
this
for
some
time
as
if
we
are
reviewing
the
adequacy
of
the
warrant.
we
are
not.
we
are
reviewing
the
reasonableness
of
these
officers'
determination
that
there
was
probable
cause.
do
you
think
it
is
at
all
pertinent
in
addressing
that
question
that
the
officers
submitted
the
affidavit
to
support
the
warrant
to
deputy
district
attorney
jane
wilson,
who
reviewed
it
and
signed
off
on
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
ask
if
it's
dispositive.
is
it
relevant
in
any
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
--
do
you
want
to
encourage
officers,
when
they
are
applying
for
search
warrants,
to
have
them
reviewed
by
the
deputy
district
attorney
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
did
they
enter
the
residence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
cite
--
well,
in
groh,
the
warrant
did
not
identify
the
items
to
be
seized
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
answer,
and
again--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me
we
keep
separating
these
two
inquiries.
it's
not
whether
the
warrant
showed
adequate
probable
cause;
it's
whether
or
not
the
officers
were
reasonable
in
believing
that
it
did.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
to
cite
groh,
a
--
no
reasonable
officer
could
think
that
a
warrant
that
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
what
is
to
be
seized
complied
with
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel
--
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
anything
in
the
affidavit
was
false?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
was
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
did
the
--
may
have
been
--
may
have
staying
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
materially
false,
that
they
said
he
resides
there,
and
what
he
knew
is
that
he
may
have
been
staying--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
coates,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief

g.
roberts,

i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-704,
messerschmidt
versus
millender.
shelly
kelly
decided
to
break
off
her
romantic
relationship
with
jerry
ray
bowen
and
moved
out
her
apartment
to
which
bowen
had
a
key.
bowen
had
assaulted
kelly
before,
was
an
active
gang
member,
and
had
an
extensive
history
of
involvement
in
violent
and
firearms
crimes.
fearing
an
attack
from
bowen,
kelly
asked
officers
from
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff's
department
to
accompany
here
while
she
gathered
her
things.
deputies
from
the
sheriff's
department
came
to
assist
kelly,
but
were
called
away
to
respond
to
an
emergency
before
the
move
was
complete.
as
soon
as
the
officers
left,
an
enraged
bowen
appeared
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
to
the
apartment,
yelling
"i
told
you
never
to
call
the
cops
on
me."
bowen
charged
up
the
stairs,
grabbed
kelly
and
tried
to
throw
her
over
the
railing
of
the
second-story
landing.
when
kelly
successfully
resisted,
bowen
bit
her
on
the
shoulder
and
attempted
to
drag
her
inside
the
apartment
by
her
hair.
she
was
able
to
break
free
and
ran
to
her
car.
as
kelly
got
into
here
car,
bowen
stepped
out
of
the
apartment
armed
with
a
pistol
grip
sawed-off
shotgun.
he
ran
in
front
car,
pointed
the
shotgun
at
kelly
and
said,
"if
you
try
to
leave,
i'll
kill
you."
kelly
ducked
behind
the
dashboards,
slammed
the
gas
pedal
and
sped
away.
bowen
fired
five
shots
at
the
car
blowing
out
the
left
front
tire
but
kelly
made
good
her
escape.
she
quickly
located
police
officers
and
reported
the
attack.
they
returned
to
the
apartment,
but
by
then
bowen
had
fled.
detective
curt
messerschmidt
was
assigned
to
investigate
the
assault.
he
prepared
an
application
for
a
warrant
to
search
the
resident
of
--
residence
of
bowen's
foster
mother,
augusta
millender,
where
kelly
said
bowen
might
be
hiding.
the
warrant
sought
authorization
to
search
for
all
firearms
and
ammunition,
as
well
as
evidence
of
gang
membership.
the
warrant
application
was
accompanied
by
affidavits
detailing
the
facts
of
the
attack
and
messerschmidt's
extensive
experience
with
gang
related
crimes.
before
submitting
the
warrants
to
a
magistrate,
messerschmidt
had
them
reviewed,
first
by
sergeant
robert
lawrence
then
by
a
police
lieutenant
and
finally,
by
deputy
district
attorney.
after
receiving
their
approvals,
messerschmidt
submitted
the
warrant
application
to
a
magistrate
who
issued
the
warrant
without
modification.
the
ensuing
search,
however,
revealed
only
a
shotgun
owned
by
the
73-year-old
millender,
a
california
social
services
letter
addressed
to
bowen,
and
a
box
of
.45-caliber
ammunition.
millender
sued
messerschmidt
and
lawrence
claiming
that
the
officers
had
subjected
them
to
an
unreasonable
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
millender's
claimed
that
the
warrant
was
to
too
broad
in
authorizing
a
search
for
all
firearms
when
the
officers
knew
only
about
a
sawed-off
shotgun
and
the
authorizing
a
search
for
evidence
of
gang
membership
when
the
crime
was
simply
a
domestic
dispute.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
millenders
and
concluded
that
the
officers
could
be
held
personally
liable
for
money
damages
because
any
reasonable
officer
would
have
known
that
the
warrant
was
unconstitutional.
for
reasons
explained
more
fully
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
there's
a
doctrine
in
our
cases
called
qualified
immunity
which
protects
government
officials
from
lawsuits
when
they
make
reasonable,
but
mistaken
judgments.
it
gives
government
officials
breathing
room
to
act
and
our
cases
have
said
that
it
protects
"all
but
the
plainly
incompetent
or
those
who
knowingly
violate
the
law."
in
this
case,
messerschmidt
and
lawrence
searched
the
millenders'
home
under
a
warrant
issued
by
a
neutral
magistrate.
the
fact
that
a
neutral
magistrate
has
issued
a
warrant
is
the
clearest
indication
that
the
officers
acted
reasonably
and
normally
is
enough
to
protect
the
officers
from
suit,
normally
but
not
always.
our
precedence
have
recognized
an
exception
allowing
suit
when
again
"it
is
obvious
that
no
reasonably
competent
officer
would
have
concluded
that
a
warrant
should
issue."
the
"shield
of
immunity"
otherwise
conferred
by
the
warrant
will
be
lost,
we
have
said,
where
the
warrant
was
"based
on
an
affidavit
so
lacking
in
indicia
of
probable
cause
as
to
render
official
belief
in
its
existence
entirely
unreasonable."
this
case
does
not
fall
within
that
narrow
exception.
now,
we
do
not
decide
whether
this
warrant
was
overbroad
in
authorizing
a
search
for
all
guns
when
there
was
information
only
about
a
specific
one.
that
specific
one
was
a
pistol
grip
sawed-off
shotgun,
owned
by
a
known
gang
member,
who
had
just
fired
the
weapon
five
times
in
public
in
an
attempt
to
murder
another
person
because
she
had
"called
the
cops"
on
him.
even
if
the
warrant
were
overbroad,
it
would
not
have
been
entirely
unreasonable
for
an
officer
to
conclude
that
someone
who
owned
a
pistol
grip
sawed-off
shotgun
might
own
other
illegal
guns
or
that
seizure
of
the
weapons
was
necessary
to
prevent
further
attacks
on
kelly.
now,
with
respect
to
the
warrant's
authorization
to
search
for
evidence
of
gang
membership,
we
do
not
think
it
would
be
again
"entirely
unreasonable
for
an
officer
to
view
this
episode
as
not
simply
a
domestic
dispute."
in
the
affidavit
he
submitted
in
support
of
the
warrant,
messerschmidt
described
the
crime
as
"a
spousal
assault
and
an
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon."
and
bowen
who
is
a
known
member
of
mona
park
crips
gang
had
attacked
kelly
after
becoming
enraged
that
she
had
called
the
cops
on
him.
a
reasonable
officer
could
view
the
attack
as
motivated
not
just
by
the
souring
of
bowen's
romantic
relationship
with
kelly
but
also
by
a
desire
to
prevent
her
from
disclosing
details
of
his
gang
activity
to
the
police.
and
a
reasonable
officer
could
conclude
that
evidence
of
bowen's
gang
membership
could
help
establish
a
motive
for
the
attack,
support
related
charges
such
as
witness
intimidation
that
could
be
brought
against
bowen,
demonstrate
that
bowen
had
familiarity
with
sawed-off
shotguns
or
tie
him
to
other
evidence
found
at
the
residence.
now,
on
top
of
all
this
the
officers
sought
and
obtained
approval
of
the
warrant
application
from
the
superior
officer
and
a
deputy
district
attorney
before
submitting
it
to
the
magistrate.
the
statements
in
the
warrant
were
true.
the
officers
thus
“took
every
step
that
could
reasonably
be
expected
of
them.”
to
conclude
that
no
reasonable
officer
could
believe
that
the
warrant
was
supported
by
probable
cause
would
mean
not
only
that
messerschmidt
and
lawrence
were
plainly
incompetent,
but
that
their
supervisor,
the
deputy
district
attorney,
and
the
magistrate
were
as
well.
so,
even
if
the
warrant
in
this
case
were
invalid,
it
was
not
so
obviously
lacking
in
probable
cause
that
the
officers
can
be
considered
plainly
incompetent
for
concluding
otherwise.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
denying
qualified
immunity
to
the
officers
is
reversed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
kagan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
