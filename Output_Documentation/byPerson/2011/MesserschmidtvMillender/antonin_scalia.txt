justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
isn't
good
faith
here,
that's
the
problem.
we
don't
have
a
good
faith
test,
we
--
we
have
a
test
that
goes
beyond
good
faith.
even
if
the
officer
is
in
good
faith,
according
to
the
test
we
have
set
forth,
if
he's
so
stupid
that
--
that
he
--
he
executes
a
warrant
that
no
reasonable
officer
could
think
was
correct,
he's
--
he's
in
the
pot,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why
are
you
going
back
to
good
faith?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
--
that
is
what
i
think
is
the
problem
with
this
case.
if
it's
a
good
faith
test,
you
come
out
with
one
result.
but
the
test
we
have
expressed
is
not
good
faith.
this
--
this
police
officer
could
have
been
in
the
best
of
faith,
but
if
he's
a
very
bad
police
officer
he's
in
the
soup,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
a
good
faith
test
for
this
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
warrant
didn't
just
authorize,
you
know,
firearms
wrapped
in
gang
colors.
it
lets
him
search
for
any
evidence
of
gang
membership,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
possible
purpose
could
that
serve?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
were
wrapped
in
it
yes.
but
we
know
he
is
a
gang
member.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
that
the
finding
of
gang
membership
decals
or
whatever
they
wear,
all
that
would
show
is
indeed
this
guy
was
a
gang
member.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
knew
he
was
in
that
premises,
i
mean
that
--
i
really
don't
understand
how
you
can
possibly
search
for
indicia
of
gang
membership
when
you
know
the
man's
a
gang
member,
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
depend
on,
whether
you
would
look
for
the
indicia
of
gang
memberships
in
places
where
you
wouldn't
look
for
guns,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
are
looking
for
photographs
that
show
gang
membership,
i
guess
you
could
look
through
photograph
albums,
you
wouldn't
really
look
there
for
guns,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
most
narrow
circumstance
is
defined
as
a
circumstance
in
which
no
reasonable
police
officer
could
have
thought
the
warrant
was
correct.
why
don't
we
adopt
a
good
faith
test
for
this
as
we
do
in
other
--
in
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--policeman.
policeman.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
like
this
mishmash.
look,
it's
either
good
faith
or
it's
--
however
good
his
faith
was,
however
well
he
showed
his
good
faith
by
checking
with
his
superiors
or
what
not,
if
he
--
if
he
made
an
incompetent
decision
it's
incompetent.
and
we
should
not
mix
the
two,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
wonderful
if
the
test
was,
was
this
--
did
this
officer
know
that
this
was
a
bad
affidavit
and
was
acting
in
bad
faith
in
executing
it?
if
that
was
the
test,
then
indeed
the
fact
that
he
had
checked
with
his
superiors
and
all
that
good
stuff
would
have
some
relevance.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
say
that
in
any
test,
you
know?
if
you
apply
it
protectively
it
will
protect.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
don't
apply
it
protectively,
it
won't
protect.
i
like
a
test
that,
you
know,
that
protects
when
it
ought
to
and
doesn't
protect
when
it
ought
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
warrant
authorized
the
search
for
and
seizure
of
all
guns,
not
just
the
guns
belonging
to
bowen.
and
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
fact,
they
seized
some
of
the
millenders'
guns,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
is
that
--
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
other
guns,
is
there
also
probable
cause
to
believe
that
any
gun
found
in
the
house
will
belong
to
them?
i
think
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
ultimately,
it's
the
officer
who
goes
into
the
millenders'
house,
seizes
their
arms,
rifles
through
their
drawers.
it's
--
it's
the
officer
that
does
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
not
execute
the
warrant?
