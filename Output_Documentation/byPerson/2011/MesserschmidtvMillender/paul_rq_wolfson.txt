mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
malley
v.
briggs,
this
court
ruled
that
police
officers
do
not
have
immunity
for
seeking
a
search
warrant
when
the
warrant
application
is
so
lacking
in
indicia
of
probable
cause
was
to
render
official
belief
in
its
existence
unreasonable.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
well,
malley
involved
a
mistake
as
to
who
the
person
under
suspicion
was
who
was
mentioned
in
the
--
in
the
wiretap.
but
the
argument
was
made
in
malley
that
is
exactly
the
argument
that
is
made
here,
which
is
that
the
police
--
it
--
one
wants
to
encourage
the
police
to
seek
warrants
from
the
magistrates,
and
it
would
be
--
and
it
would
be,
it
would
be
undesirable
if
the
police
were
not
given
effectively
absolute
immunity
when
they
seek
a
warrant
from
a
magistrate,
except
of
course
when
they
--
when
they
lie,
which
is
a
separate
question.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
officers
who
seek
warrants
from
magistrates
will
be
immune.
and
the
court
made
clear
in
malley
that
it
does
happen
that
officers
make
mistakes,
good
faith
mistakes
as
to
whether
a
particular
set
of
facts
amounts
to
probable
cause,
and
in
that
context
when
there
is
a
good
faith
mistake
the
officers
will
have
immunity.
but
the
court
also
stressed
that
officers
must
minimize
the
risk
of
fourth
amendment
violations
by
exercising
reasonable
professional
judgment
in
applying
for
search
warrants.
and
so
the
court
ruled
that
an
officer
will
not
be
immune
if
a
"reasonably
well
trained
officer",
which
is
the
term
the
court
used,
would
not
have
believed
that
the
warrant
affidavit
established
probable
cause.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
a
reasonable
--
that
a
reasonably
well
trained
officer
would
not
have
sought
the
search
warrant.
i
don't
think
the
california
penal
code
provision
really
adds
anything
to
the
rest
of
the
case,
because
it
says
that
you
may
seek
items
that
are
intended
to
be
used
in
a
crime,
but
you
still
have
to
know,
you
still
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
are
such
items.
and
so
the
cases
where--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--well,
mr.
bowen
is
not
our
client,
justice
alito.
mr.
bowen--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--no,
but
this
is
an
important
point.
our
clients
are
the
innocent
family
that
lives
in
the
house
where--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--no,
i
understand,
but--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--but
i
want
to
make
the
point,
not
only
do
the
police
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
such
an
item,
they
also
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
will
be
found
in
the
place
that
they
propose
to
search.
i
mean,
probable
cause--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--well,
we
are
contesting
that.
we're
contesting
that--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--it's
not
an
issue
here.
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
mr.
bowen
would
be
found--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--well,
there
are
several
--
i
think
there
are
several
problems
with
that.
the
first
problem
is
the
police
don't
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
another
one,
and
they
don't
--
and
they
certainly
don't
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
any
other
such
gun
would
be
found
at
the
millenders'
house
and
i
--
the
millenders'
house
where
innocent
people
live.
now
--
and
it's
not
just
that
no
other
such
gun
would
be
found
at
the
millenders'
or
the
millenders
themselves
had
right
to
possess
handguns
for
lawful
purposes
of
self
defense.
so
it's
possible,
of
course
it
is
possible
to
speculate
about
the
things
that
the
police
might--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--correct.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
no,
i
would
not
--
i
would
not
say
that,
justice
kennedy
because
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--because
if
the
police
are
in
a
place
where,
lawfully
in
a
place
pursuant
to
a
properly,
narrowly
drawn
warrant,
and
they
--
and
they
see
something
in
plain
view,
under
this
court's
plain
view
doctrine
as
articulated
in
horton
v.
california,
and
there
is
probable
cause
to
see
something
there
to
associate
with
criminal
activity,
yes,
the
police
can
--
can
seize
that.
but
it's
--
but
there
is
a
big
difference
between
thinking
about
what
the
police
can
do
if
they
enter
someplace
lawfully,
and
how
they
can
react--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--yes,
but--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--i
think
the
assumption,
as
i
understood,
behind
justice
kennedy's
question
was,
if
the
police
see
something
--
happen
to
see
something
in
the
house
that
is
probable
cause
of
a
crime--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--because
the
police
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
any
other
gun,
and
they
certainly--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--but
it
doesn't
--
excuse
me.
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
an
arsenal
of
weapons
with
him
in
an
innocent
third
party's
house.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
i
would
say
not,
your
honor,
but
i--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--i
--
i
think
it
can't
be
dispositive,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
relevant,
but
i
would
say
it
--
it
doesn't
make
the
case
in
this
case,
for
a
few
reasons.
first
of
all,
generally
speaking,
of
course,
if
you
can't
rely
on
the
magistrate
as
a
--
you
know,
as
a
blanket
rule
that
you
are
not
immune,
it's
hard
to
understand
why
the
fact
that
the
deputy
district
attorney
signed
off
on
it
would
have
essentially
the
same
effect
that
the
court
rejected
in
malley,
when
it
said,
you
know,
there
will
be
a
limited
set
of
circumstances
where
even
if
--
even
if
a
magistrate
issues
a
warrant,
the
officer
will
be
liable.
so
i
don't
think
--
i
mean,
the
district
attorney
and
the
superior
are
on
the
same
crime-fighting
team
as
the
--
as
the
--
as
detective
messerschmidt
in
this
case.
also,
we
really
--
we
have
no
information
about
what
transpired
in
these
conversations
with
the
deputy
district
attorney.
we
don't
know
whether
the
d.a.
said
to
detective
messerschmidt:
oh,
you
know,
you're
good,
you're
pushing
the
envelope
here,
but
we
might
just
find
a
magistrate
who
will
go
along
with
it,
so
--
you
know,
so
see
what
you
can
get.
and
the
other
point
is,
of
course,
relying
on
your
superiors
and
on
the
d.a.
is
a
double-edged
sword
in
many
cases,
because
that
--
in
fact,
that
can
establish
or
go
a
long
way
towards
establishing
monell
liability,
if
you
establish
that
there's
a
pattern
of
superiors
and
of
deputy
district
attorneys--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--certainly
we
want
them
to
encourage
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
point
is,
in
malley,
this
court
made
clear
that
ultimately,
a
reasonably
--
a
reasonably
well-trained
officer
must
make
a
judgment
himself
as
to
whether
the
course
of
conduct
that
he
proposes
to
undertake
could
reasonably
be
thought
to
be
within
the
law.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
well,
the
officers
who
are
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
officers
who
actually
applied
for
the
search
warrant
and
who
actually
drafted
the
search
warrant
for
the
magistrate
to
sign.
now,
they
then
were
present
at
the
search.
i
think
there
is
a--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
they
were
--
they
were
--
they
were
part
of
the
executing
team,
yes.
they
were--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--they
entered
the
residence,
yes.
there
were
other
officers
who
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
kind
of
more
--
undertook
the
more-concrete
search
of
the
--
you
know,
of
the
house
from
top
to
bottom.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
question
about
when
a
line
officer
relies
on
his
lead
officer's
instructions.
and
that
was
actually
discussed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
--
in
the
groh
case
which
later
came
up
to
--
came
up
to
this
court.
but
i
think
the
--
the
standard
that
the
court
set
forth
in
malley,
the
objective
reasonableness
standard,
is
really
--
is
consistent
with
this
court's
qualified
immunity
case
law.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
i
don't
really--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--well,
the
petitioners
have
never
suggested
that
reading
before.
and
indeed,
the
petitioners
have
--
indeed,
detective
messerschmidt
testified
at
his
deposition,
no,
i
didn't
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
crime
was
gang-related.
i
mean,
one
of
the
curious
things
about
the
--
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
are
now
making,
which
is
that
you
can
go
outside
the
warrant
and
import
into
it
the
fact
that
he
was
a
felon,
one
of
the
curious
things
about
that
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
officers
told
the
magistrate
this
is
a
violent
crime,
no
question,
he
is
a
gang
member
--
not
in
support
of
probable
cause,
but
in
support
of
night
service.
they
told
the
magistrate
that
they
had
reviewed
all
the
various
government
databases,
specifically
including
police
databases,
but
did
not
tell
the
magistrate
that
he
had
any
criminal
record
at
all.
but
that's
so--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--well,
a
couple
of
responses.
first
of
all,
i
think
this
court's
decisions
in
groh
and
other
courts
made
clear
that
when
you
are
evaluating
whether
--
whether
the
respondents
were
harmed
by
this
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights,
you
have
to
look
at
the
warrant
that
was
actually
applied
for
and
executed,
not
--
you
don't
--
you
don't
compare
it
to
a
hypothetical
warrant
that
the
police
might
have
gotten
if
they
had
applied
for
a
properly
limited
warrant.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
that
is
correct.
but
the
argument
was
made
in
groh
was,
well,
there
really
was
no
harm
because
surely
the
officers
had
probable
cause,
and
if
they
had
done
their
work
right,
there
was
i
think
no
question
that
they
would
have
gotten
a
warrant.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
i
understand.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
but
the
argument
was
made
in
groh
that
essentially
this
was
sort
of
no
harm,
no
foul,
because
surely
a
reasonable
police
officer
could
have
obtained
a
valid
warrant.
and
i
was
--
i
was
sort
of
analogizing
that
to
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
made.
i
don't
think
that
really
is
a
question
of
qualified
immunity
at
all.
i
think
that
may
be
a
question
of
damages
as
to
whether
you
could
think
oh,
well,
perhaps
the
police
might
have
gotten
a
valid
warrant
and
so
forth.
but
--
so
i
think,
sure,
it's
possible
to
imagine
that
the
police
could
have
gotten
a
valid,
narrow
warrant
limited
to
--
limited
to
search
for
the
sawed-off
shotgun,
and
--
and
certainly
not
the
gang-related
activity,
but
they
didn't.
and
one
has
to
--
one
has
to
measure
the
harm
that
the
--
that
the
millenders
suffered
by
execution
of
this--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--invalid
warrant.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
right.
we
do
disagree.
we
would
submit
that
the
--
that
it's
still
--
that
it's
still
invalid.
but
this
is
an
issue
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
wrestled
with
under
what
is
called
the
severance
doctrine,
which
mostly
is
applied
in
exclusionary
rule
cases,
not
in
qualified
immunity
cases.
this
court
has
actually
never
explicitly
endorsed
the
severance
doctrine,
and
that
is
the
question
that
suppose
you
have
a
warrant
that
is
sort
of
half
valid
and
half
invalid;
or
maybe
half
arguably
valid
but
half
totally,
you
know,
totally
valid.
what
do
you
do
then?
and
the
--
i
think
at
a
minimum
the
record
would
not
permit
this
court
to
--
to
resolve
that
because
we
don't
know
from
the
record
before
us
sort
of
what
part
of
the
search
was
conducted
under
what
part
of
the
--
of
the
warrant.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
right.
so
justice
alito,
there
are
certainly
are
circumstances
in
which
it
is
legitimate
to
seek
for
information
that
links
a
particular
person
to
a
particular
location
for
purposes
of
establishing
criminal
liability.
the
--
you
know,
there
are
many
cases,
for
example,
where
police
come
across
a
meth
lab
or
something
like
that,
and
of
course
in
that
situation
the
police
have
a
legitimate
reason
to
--
to
want
to
know
who
is
present,
whose
fingerprints
are
all
over
the
place,
because
that
would
tend
to
establish
that
the
person
is
--
is
in
unlawful
possession
of
methamphetamine.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
for
--
for
a
few
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
120th
street
address,
like
the
millenders'
house,
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
actual
crime
under
investigation
which
took
--
someplace
else.
i
mean
it's
just
a
happenstance
that
the
--
that
the
police
are
searching
--
searching
this
place.
it's
not
the
place;
this
is
not
a
tavern
or
a
still
or--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--but
the
gang-related
indicia
part
of
the
warrant
is
--
first
of
all,
much,
much
broader
than
that;
and
secondly
the
petitioners
have
never
argued
until
this
court
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
gang-related
indicia
part
of
the
warrant.
i
mean,
the
petitioners
argued
that
the
gang-related
indicia
part
of
the
warrant
is
intended
to
establish
his
--
his
gang
membership.
and
--
because
for
example,
there
might
be
a
--
an
increase
in
penalty
if
something
is
a
gang-related
crime.
even--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--well,
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
does
not
mean
that
one
can
engage
essentially
in
a
completely
post-hoc
rationalization
of
what
the
objective
search
by
the
--
to
be
accomplished
by
the
warrant
is.
i
mean,
the
warrant
application
itself
says
this
is
a
spousal
assault
that
the
police
are
investigating.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
it's
a
gang-related
crime
in
any
way.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
well,
of
course
this
court
has
never
required
that,
for
qualified
immunity
purposes,
that
the
case
--
there
be
another
case
exactly
on
point.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
respectfully,
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
i
agree,
and
i
think
that
it's
--
it's
useful
to
look
at
two
related
but
somewhat
different
lines
of
cases,
particularly
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
actually,
you
know,
all
across
the
board
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
first
line
of
cases
says
if
the
police
have
reason,
or
have
probable
cause
to
look
for
a
specific
object,
or
specific
--
even
a
specific
kind
of
object,
that
doesn't
give
them
probable
cause
to
look
for
the
whole
generic
class
of
objects
that
are
somewhat
similar.
the
leading
case
on
this
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
spilotro
decision,
but
there
are
many
cases
coming
both
before
and
after
that
stand
for
that
proposition.
the
--
the
principle
has
been
applied
in
many
contexts.
for
example,
if
you
think
somebody
is
committing
fraud
for
years
1998
and
1999,
and
there
are
billing
records,
you
can't
--
you
don't
have
probable
cause
to
look
for
fraud,
you
know,
for
the
entire
records,
billing
records
from
1950
to
the
present.
if
you
think
that
--
if
you
see
somebody
run
over
somebody
else
in
a
green
nissan
sentra,
you
don't
have
probable
cause
to
search
for
all
vehicles
including
a
red
ford
--
a
red
ford
explorer.
this
is
really
that
principle
in
the
context
of
firearms.
and
it
--
and
detective
messerschmidt
had
the
information
that
the
case
involved
a
black
sawed-off
shotgun
with
a
pistol
grip.
now
there
certainly
are
cases--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
yes,
i
think
there
are
many
things
the
police
can
do.
first
of
all,
an
assault
rifle
is
illegal,
so
that
per
se
is
contraband--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--right.
okay.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
well,
the
police
--
if
--
and
so
one
question
is
do
the
police
know
that
mr.
bowen
is
a
felon?
and
here
i
think
that
is
relevant,
because
they
are
dealing
with
what
not
what
is
in
the
affidavit,
but
to
on-the-spot
judgments.
so
if
the
police--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--so
--
okay.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
right.
so
i
think
there
are
--
i
think
if
the
police
have
probable
cause,
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
they
actually
encounter
at
the
house,
that
the
guns--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--that
the--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--the
police
may
be
able
to
secure
all
of
those
weapons,
certainly
so
that
they
pose
no
danger
to
anybody
else;
and
if
mr.
bowen
is
arrested
and
then,
if
--
if
he
is
to
be
released
on
bail
or
on
pretrial
release,
it's
a
very
common
condition
that
he
not
have
access
to
any
weapons.
the
police
--
it
may
be
required
that
he
deposit
those
weapons
with
somebody
else
who,
you
know,
is
a
proper
custodian--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--i
don't
think
they
--
necessarily
have
to
leave
the
weapons
there.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
if
there
is
no
--
well,
if
he
not,
if
he
is
not
there,
then
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
he
has
a
fourth
amendment
standing
to
challenge
anything.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
it's
his
room.
but
if
he's
--
i
mean,
but
if
he's
--
if
they
really
believe
that
the
police,
that
he
is
there,
that
it
is
his
house,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
his
possession
of
any
of
those
weapons
is
illegal,
there
are
--
the
police
can
do
things
to
secure--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--right.
[laughter]
i
think
there
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
the
police
can
say
these
weapons
are
just
ours,
we
are
going
to
take
them,
we
can
seize
them
without
--
without
probable
--
without
more
probable
cause.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
no--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--but
if
the
police
--
the
police
have
--
if
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
he
--
on
the
spot
that
he
will
use
that
weapons,
yes,
they
can
seize
them
under
that
provision
of
the
california
penal
code,
but
that
does
not
mean
they
have
probable
cause
when
they
apply
for
the
--
the
warrant,
to
think
that
those
weapons
either
will--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--yes.
i--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--i
think--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--they
could
--
they
may
be
able
to
take
them
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
knew
that
they
existed
in
the
first
place
or
that
they
would
be
at
the
millenders'
house.
that's
--
that
i
think
is
the
fundamental
difference.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
it's
not
clear,
justice
ginsburg.
they
took
them
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant.
they
did
not
provide
an
explanation
as
to
specifically
why
they
were
--
why
the
gun
was
seized,
but
the
gun
was
seized.
and
this
--
i
think
that's
really
the
--
this
point,
that
they
went
into
the
millenders'
house,
searched
the
house
from
top
to
bottom,
and
seized
the
millenders'
--
mrs.
millender's
lawfully
owned
weapon
really
shows
that
this
case
is
in
the
heartland
of
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned
about.
i
mean,
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case
that
the
framers
were
concerned
about
when
they
abolished
the
general
warrant.
this
is
the
sort
of
case--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--yes.
false
or
at
least
--
or
at
least
misleading.
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
i
think
the
--
the
--
the
proposition
that
bowen
quote,
unquote
120th
street
address,
and
that
that
--
and
that
that
conclusion
was
drawn
from
among
other
things,
detective
messerschmidt's
search
of
government
databases
was
material
misleading,
because
he
didn't
reside
there.
he
may
have
been
staying
--
hiding
out
there,
and
the
search
of
the
government
database
which
are
actually
--
the
results
are
actually
reprinted--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--that
is
what
shelley
kelly
told
detective
messerschmidt
which
is,
if
i
am
not
mistaken--
mr.
paul
rq
wolfson
--he
may
have
been
hiding
out
there.
when
--
especially
when
you
combine
that
with
all
the
other
information
that
detective
messerschmidt
actually
obtained
from
the
printouts
of
the
databases
which
are
in
the
ja,
which
in
fact
say
that
he
hadn't
been
at
the
120th
street
address
for
several
months
and
his
most
recent
address
was
97th
street
where
he
lived
with
--
where
he
stayed
with,
at
least
sometimes,
shelley
kelly
and
gave
it
out
as
his
address.
so
that
--
that
is
in
respects
why
we
think
this
is
materially
misleading.
of
course,
we
were
not
allowed
to
appeal
that
determination.
so
that
really
only
half
of
the
case
in
that
respect
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
before
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
