mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
an
officer
follows
the
favored
practice
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
obtaining
a
warrant
from
a
neutral
magistrate
before
conducting
a
search,
the
officer
in
all
but
the
most
narrow
circumstances
can
rely
on
the
magistrate's
independent
determination
of
probable
cause.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
one
of
the
questions
that
would
arise
is
whether
the
one
as
to
which
you
thought
there
was
a
problem
would
expand
the
scope
in
a
meaningful
way.
because
if
--
let's
take
your
honor's
hypothesis
that
there
is
less
of
a
reason
to
be
concerned
about
the
firearms
related
aspects
of
the
warrant
than
the
gang
related
parts
of
the
warrant,
then
the
question
would
arise
whether
you
would
have
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
the
first
place.
because
if
the
gang
related
parts
of
the
warrant
didn't
expand
the
scope
of
the
search
in
such
a
way
that
would
implicate
independent
privacy
interest,
there
wouldn't
be
a
fourth
amendment
problem
with
that
aspect
of
the
warrant
and
therefore
you
wouldn't
have
the
qualified
immunity
issue
for
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
you
look
at
the
two
aspects
of
the
warrant
and
you
ask
whether
the
second
one
which
is
hypothetical
to
be
the
problematic
one
would
allow
you
to
search
in
places
or
search
with
more
intensity
than
the
first--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
but
no.
i
think
the
relevant
is
page
52
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
is
what
sets
fourth
the
two
paragraphs
at
issue.
and
the
first
paragraph
which
justice
kagan
supposes
doesn't
raise
a
problem
and
i'll
--
to
that
assumption.
it
provides
not
only
for
searches
of
all
firearms,
but
it
provides
and
we
think
legitimately
for
searches
of
any
receipts
or
paperwork
showing
the
purchase,
ownership
or
possession
of
the
guns
being
sought.
and
so
it
--
and
paperwork
certainly
includes
photographs.
because
if
you
find
photographs
of
an
individual
carrying
a
particular
firearm,
that's
good
evidence.
so
photographic
evidence
is
within
the
scope
of
the
first
paragraph
not
just
the
second.
and
so
it
does
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
second
paragraph
increases
the
scope.
the
other
point
i
would
raise
in
this
respect
is
that
in
the
second
paragraph
itself
the
anchor
sentence
in
some
respects
in
the
second
paragraph
is
the
second
sentence,
which
discusses
not
gang
related
indicia
in
particular
but
articles
of
personal
property
tending
to
establish
the
identity
of
persons
and
control
of
their
premise
or
premises
writ
large.
and
that
provision
has
not
been
seen
to
have
a
problem
associated
with
it
thus
far.
the
district
court
thought
it
was
okay.
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
27(a)
of
the
petition
appendix
seemed
to
assume
it
was
okay.
and
that's
understandable
because
there
are
a
legion
of
cases
that
support
those
sorts
of
provisions,
including
the
ewing
case
cited
by
the
majority
below.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
--
i
think
the
court
has
attempted
to
do
that
in
malley
and
leon
itself,
because
it
has
made
clear
that
in
the
main,
in
all
but
the
most
narrow
circumstances
where
a
magistrate
does
find
the
existence
of
probable
cause,
the
court
need
not
engage
in
any
searching
inquiry
to
determine
the
qualified
immunity
is
appropriate.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
in
some
sense,
justice
scalia,
you
have
two,
in
response,
two
parts
of
your
question.
first
of
all
in
defining
what
is
objectively
unreasonable
in
this
situation,
the
court
has
used
some
pretty
strong
language.
in
malley
it
spoke
in
terms
of
a
magistrate
who
is
grossly
incompetent.
and
in
leon
it
spoke
of--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
it
was
speaking
of
a
magistrate
actually,
not
the
officers.
because
the
point
in
order
to
find
the
officers
are
liable
in
this
situation,
the
officers
would
have
to
be
so
sure
that
probable
cause
is
lacking
that
only
a
grossly
incompetent
magistrate
could
sign
off
on
the
probable
cause
assessment.
so
it
used
gross
incompetence
with
respect
to
the
magistrate
which
illustrates
the
degree
to
which
the
standard
is
heightened
in
this
context.
and
in
terms
of
whether
the
good
faith
principles
come
into
play
in
the
qualified
immunity
context,
what
the
courts
said
in
malley
is
that
the
same
standard
of
objective
reasoning
--
of
reasonableness
that
governs
in
the
good
faith
context
for
suppression
purposes
also
governs
in
the
qualified
immunity
context
in
1983.
and
so
i
think
there
is
room
to
import
into
the
qualified
immunity
context
these
principles
of
good
faith
like
for
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
of
whether
the
officers
in
question
asked
superiors
for
their
assessment
of
whether
there
is
probable
cause.
and
in
sheppard,
which
was
a
suppression
case,
but
in
sheppard
at
page
98
and
9
of
the
opinion
the
court
specifically
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
officer
in
that
case
had
asked
for
a
probable
cause--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well
that,
i
mean
certainly
i
don't
want
to
urge
anything
upon
the
court
that
would
tend
to
water
down
the
standard
in
the
suppression
context,
but
the
only
point
i
would
add
to
this,
justice
scalia,
is
that
when
you
are
looking
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
a
reasonable
officer
who
is
trying
to
assess
whether
he
should
go
forward
and
ask
for
assessment
of
probably
cause
from
the
magistrate,
one
consideration
that
seems
natural
to
take
into
account
is
what
actions
the
officer
has
taken,
not
just
the
quantum
of
proof
that
the
officer
has
put
in
the
affidavit
but
what
actions
has
he
taken.
has
he
asked
for--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
test
as
outlined
by
the
court
in
malley
is
whether
it's
subjectively
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
rely
on
the
magistrate's
judgment
of
probable
cause.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it's
--
the
court
did
say
that,
your
honor,
and
the
court
put
the
formulation
in
a
number
of
respects
in
malley
itself.
it
said,
344:
"we
hold
that
the
same
standard
of
objective
reasonableness
that
we
applied
in
the
context
of
the
suppression
hearing
in
leon
defines
the
qualified
immunity
accorded
an
officer
whose
request
for
a
warrant
allegedly
caused
an
unconstitutional
arrest.
"
and
i
think
that's
where
the
court
then
goes
on
and
articulates
what
your
honor
just
quoted.
but
then
the
court
later
says:
345:
in
leon
we
stated
that
our
objective
faith
"--"
good
faith
inquiry
is
confined
to
the
objectively
ascertainable
question
of
whether
a
reasonable
well-trained
officer
would
have
known
that
the
search
was
illegal
despite
the
magistrate's
authorization.
the
analogous
question
in
this
case,
"and
it
goes
on
to
speak
about
the
analogy
question.
"
mr.
sri
srinivasan
we
think
if
the
current
test
is
applied
properly,
it's
sufficiently
protective.
and
really
the
question
is
how
it's
applied.
and
in
this
case
it
was
applied
in
a
way
that
i
think
is
not
sufficiently
protective.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
you
could--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--applied
--
well,
i
meant
to
say
applied
correctly,
if
applied
correctly.
i
apologize
if
i
misspoke.
if
applied
correctly,
it
should
sufficiently
protect--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no
--
not
--
not
necessarily
the
general
rule,
justice
kennedy.
it
has
to
be
context
specific.
here
you
had
a
lot
more
than
that.
you
had
an
individual
who
had
perpetrated
an
attempted
murder,
who
was
a
known
member
of
a
violent
gang,
who
had
--
who
had
perpetrated
physical
assaults
against
this
victim
before,
and
who
had
directly
threatened
the
victim
that
he
would
murder
her
if
she
ever
went
to
the
police,
and
that
he
was
going
to
kill
her.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well
that's
the
test
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes,
this
is
a
very
important
point,
justice
kennedy.
at
page
48
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
language
of
the
relevant
california
statute
is
set
forth.
the
california
provision
is
section
1524(a)(3)
of
the
california
penal
code,
and
it
authorizes
a
search
for
and
seizure
of
items
where
they
are
possessed
by
a
person
with
intent
to
use
them
as
a
means
of
committing
a
public
offense.
and
that's
the
provision
that
was
invoked
this
very
warrant.
and
there
--
and
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that
provision
is
by
no
means
an
outlier.
it's
in
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
41(c)(3)
and
it's
in
the
model
penal
code
of
pre-arraignment
procedure
at
section
210.3,
subsection
(1)(c).
thank
you.
