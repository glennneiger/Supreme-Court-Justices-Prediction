justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
something
very
strange
about
the
rule
we
are
applying
here.
a
warrant
was
issued
by
a
judge
in
the
superior
court,
isn't
that
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
--
and
so
that
judge,
who
is
a
lawyer
and
was
appointed
as
a
judge
and
presumably
has
some
familiarity
with
the
fourth
amendment,
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
for
all
of
these
things.
and
now
we
are
asking
whether
a
reasonable
police
officer
who
is
not
a
lawyer
and
certainly
is
not
a
judge
should
have
been
able
to
see
that
this
call
that
was
made
by
a
judge
was
not
only
wrong
but
so
wrong
that
it
--
you
couldn't
reasonably
think
that
the
judge
might
be
correct.
is
there
some
way
to
phrase
this,
if
this
rule
is
to
be
retained
in
any
form,
is
there
some
way
to
phrase
it
so
that
it
is
narrowed
appropriately?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
the
case
here
that
a
reasonably
well
trained
officer
would
not
--
would
understand
that
this
warrant
was
defective
in
authorizing
a
search
for
guns
other
than
the
shotgun
in
question
when
a
provision
of
the
california
penal
code
says
that
a
search
warrant
may
be
issued
to
seize
items
intended
for
use
in
committing
a
crime?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
your
client
who
has
discharged
a
sawed-off
shotgun
at
his
former
girlfriend
in
an
attempt
to
kill
her.
and
he
is
known
to
be
a
member
of
a
violent
gang,
and
he
has
threatened
to
kill
her,
and
so
a
reasonable
police
officer
would
--
could
not
think,
well,
he
might
have
some
other
guns
and
he
--
and
there
would
be
an
intent
to
use
those
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
that
he
has
threatened
to
commit.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
excuse
me.
mr.
bowen--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
that
was
just
--
that
a
misstatement
on
my
part.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
he
could
not
think
that
about
mr.
bowen?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
it
was
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
living
in
these
premises,
isn't
that
correct?
and
you're
not
contesting
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
an
issue
before
us.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
living
in
those
premises,
then
what
is
wrong
with
a
reasonable
officer
thinking:
he's
tried
to
kill
her
in
the
past
using
one
gun;
he's
a
member
of
a
gang;
he
is
very
likely
to
have
--
to
possess
or
have
access
to
other
guns;
those
other
guns
may
be
found
in
the
home
where
we
believe
he
is
living,
and
he
is
intending
to
use
them
to
carry
out
the
threat
that
he
has
promised,
the
threat
that
he
has
made?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
gang
paraphernalia?
why
couldn't
an
officer
reasonably
believe
that
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
seize
that
--
to
search
for
and
seize
that,
because
it
would
link
mr.
bowen
with
this
residence
where
they
hoped
to
find
the
shotgun?
and
you
dispute
the
fact
that
he
is
--
that
he
is
associated
with
that
residence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
why
couldn't
a
reasonable
officer
think
that
that
would
be
the
case
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
well,
if
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
sawed-off
shotgun
is
there;
let's
suppose
they
find
the
sawed-off
shotgun.
then
there's
going
to
be
an
issue
at
trial:
was
it
his
sawed-off
shotgun?
and
anything
that
links
him
to
that
residence
is
valuable
evidence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
this
was
a
test
of
what
they
could
--
what
a
reasonable
officer
could
have
believed,
not
what
they
in
particular
believed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
to
come
back
to
a
question
that
was
asked
before--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--suppose
they
were
issuing
--
suppose
the
warrant
just
sought
this
--
the
--
that
particular
weapon.
they
execute
it,
and
they
come
to
a
room
in
this
house
and
it's
got
mr.
bowen's
name
on
it,
and
inside
there
is
a
gun
cabinet
and
there
are
--
there's
--
there
are
a
whole
--
there
is
a
whole
array
of
guns,
legal
--
let's
say
he
legally
possesses
them.
there's
a
--
there's
a
--
these
are
assault
rifles,
there
are
pistols;
and
it's
known
that
he's
threatened
to
kill
his
girlfriend.
you
say
--
would
the
police
be
able
to
seize
those?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
all
sorts
of
legal
weapons--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
could
be
used.
could
they
--
could
they
seize
those?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
am
hypothesizing--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--he
has
a
license
for
all
of
these.
he's
not--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
circumstances
are
exactly
the
circumstances
here--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--except
for
the
two
things
that
i
changed.
it's
his
room,
and
it's
his
gun
cabinet.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
happens
if
they
don't
find
him?
he
is
still
at
large.
they
have
to
leave
the
weapons
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--why?
on
what
grounds
could
they
seize
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
his
room.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
can't
say
we
are
going
to
take
them
under
--
we're
going
to
take
them
so
that
he
can't
use
those
to
kill
his
girlfriend
which
is
what
he
has
threatened
to
do?
they
just
have
to
leave
them
there--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
if
he
happens
to
come
back
and
--
and
get
those
weapons,
and
he
kills
her,
well,
that's
just
too
bad?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
really
--
you
really
are
not
answering
my
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
my
question
is:
everything
is
exactly
the
same
except
that
it's
his
room
and
he's
not
a
felon
and
he
possesses
them
legally
and
there
they
are
and
they
see
them.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
your
answer
is
they
can
take
them;
in
which
case
my
question
is,
why
wouldn't
they
have
probable
cause
to
search
for
those
in
the
first
place?
or
they
can't
take
them,
in
which
case
i
say
well,
what
about
the
possibility
that
he
will
come
back,
get
those
weapons
and
carry
out
his
threat
using
those
weapons?
