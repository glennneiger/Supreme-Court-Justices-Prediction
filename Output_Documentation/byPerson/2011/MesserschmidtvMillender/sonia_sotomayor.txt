justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
thought
in
the
leon
case
that
in
fact,
just
like
the
claim
in
this
case,
that
the
affidavit
was
submitted
to
supervisors
and
the
court
created
the
leon
test
in
spite
of
that.
so
to
say
that
we
have
a
case
on
point,
leon
itself
is
on
point.
we
created
the
test
in
the
face
supervisor's
review.
you
are
not
actually,
are
you,
arguing
a
nuremberg
defense
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
that
simply
because
supervisors
decide
that
it's
okay,
that
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--exculpates
someone
from
responsibility?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
then
let's
go
to
the
other
two
ways
that
i
think
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
our
precedent.
the
first
is
using
subjective
information
that
a
police
officer
knows,
but
hasn't
disclosed
in
the
warrant.
i'm
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
understanding
how
an
entire
warrant
regime
that
presumes
that
the
magistrate
has
all
pertinent
information,
and
that's
why
you
would
be
let
off
the
hook,
how
you
can
excuse
a
police
officer
when
he
doesn't
place
that
information
in
front
of
the
magistrate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
how,
this
case,
the
bare-bone
affidavit
was
sufficient?
all
it
says
is
that
this
defendant
is
a
member
of
a
gang,
but
when
the
police
officer
is
questioned,
he
is
asked
whether
this
crime
at
issue
had
any
connection
to
his
gang
relationship
and
the
answer
was
no.
so
how
is
the
request
of
the
warrant
to
search
for
all
gang-related
indicia
anything
more
than
the
general
warrant
that
our
founding
fathers
in
part
passed
the
fourth
amendment
against?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
almost
like--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
do
we
do
with
the
officer's
testimony
when
he
said,
"did
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
there
were
any
more
weapons
in
the
house?
"
he
said,
"no".
what
--
when
an
officer
says
that,
why
would
then
he
think
that
he
has
complete
license
to
go
and
ask
for
a
warrant
that's
looking
for
more
guns,
when
there
is
only
evidence
of
him
possessing
one?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
answering
--
you
are
answering
justice
ginsburg
by
saying
that
any
time
a
gang
member
commits
any
crime,
the
police
are
entitled
to
seek
a
warrant
that
permits
the
search
for
anything
they
have
in
their
home
that
relates
to
their
gang
membership
and
to
--
to
guns?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
did
not
involve
--
by
the
officer's
admission
and
your
own,
that
wasn't
gang-related.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
assault--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
wait
a
minute.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
gang,
unless
you
are
saying
that
you
had
proof
that
the
gang
did
something
illegally
in
helping
him
procure
the
weapon.
what
information
did
you
have
to
suggest
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
tell
me
something.
there
is
ten
people
in
this
house.
there
is
ten
people
in
this
house
and
as
i
understand
it
from
the
questioning,
they
also
knew
other
gang
members
were
there.
so
even
if
they
found
gang
colors,
did
they
tell
the
manufacturer
or
the
magistrate
that
--
what
would
that
prove
when
there
is
multiple
members
in
the
house.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
he
admitted
to
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
anything
other
than
a
general
search
--
a
general
search.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
again,
in
the
hope
of
finding
evidence
of
other
crimes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
it
sounds
like.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
keep
adding
facts
that
weren't
in--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
happens--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--below
on
that
question?
following
up
on--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
same
question
that
justice
kagan
asked
if
your
brethren,
which
is
how
about
we
find
that
it
was
reasonable
to
ask
for
the
guns
but
not
for
the
gang-related
materials?
what
does
that
do
with
your
claim,
and
do
you
disagree
with
the
manner
in
which
he
described
what
the
inquiry
would
be
below,
or
before
us
now?
