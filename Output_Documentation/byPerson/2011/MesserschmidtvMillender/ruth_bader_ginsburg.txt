so
if
you
have
a
gang
member
and
the
crime
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
gang
membership
--
that
i
think
is
the
case
here;
it's
a
domestic
assault
--
as
long
as
you
are
a
gang
member,
than
every
warrant
can
say
"search
for
all
gang-related
information"?
that's
essentially
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you
said
this
is
domestic
assault.
there
is
no
gang
activity
involved
in
that
assault,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
anyone
who
has
a
weapon
and
is
a
member
of
a
gang
then
can
be
--
there
can
be
a
search
for
any
and
all
weapons
and
material
related
to
weapons?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
on
to
the
part
about
all
gang-related
activities,
when
the
crime
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
gang.
let's
--
let's
stick
to
that.
then
there
is
another
issue.
but
this
said
warrant
to
search
for
any
and
all
gang-related
items?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
didn't
need
to
tie
him
to
the
shotgun.
they
had
photographs
of
him
with
the
shotgun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
do
you
need
more
than
here
he
is,
with
his
gun,
the
defendant
himself
and
his
gun?
i
mean,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
a
provision
for
any
photographs
that
depict
evidence
of
criminal
activity?
that
seems
to
me
as
general
as
you
can
get.
photographs
depicting
evidence
of
criminal
activity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
the
test
was
so
lacking
in
indicia
of
probable
cause
as
to
render
official
belief
in
its
existence
unreasonable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
suppose
they
had
had
a
warrant
to
search
just
for
the
sawed-off
shotgun.
you
conceded
that
when
they
go
into
the
house
and
they
are
looking
all
over,
they
could
look
in
cabinets
and
drawers
to
find
pieces
of
the
shotgun.
they
come
across
other
guns,
they
can
at
least
secure
--
take
those
guns
for
their
own
safety.
there
are
other
people
in
the
house
and
somebody
might
use
them.
so
what's
--
what's
the
difference
in
the
scope
of
the
search
if
they
have
a
warrant
just
to
look
for
the
sawed-off
shotgun
or
if
they
have
a
warrant
that
covers
any
guns?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
here
when
they
--
they
--
they
did
seize
weapons
that
belonged
to
the
plaintiff,
mrs.
millender?
they
--
they
took
them
because
they
thought
they
were
the
defendant's?
not
that
--
they
thought
they
were
bowen's?
