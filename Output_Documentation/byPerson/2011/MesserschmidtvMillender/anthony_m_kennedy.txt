justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
background
of
this
case
is
this
question.
a
suspect
has
a
weapon.
he
flees.
as
a
general
rule,
do
you
think
that
warrants
can
say
that
when
they
search
the
home
or
the
place
where
this
person
is
likely
to
be,
they
can
seize
all
weapons?
is
this
the
general
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
test
is
whether
or
not
he
is
likely
to
commit
another
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
thought
the
petitioner
said
--
i
didn't
have
the
time
to
interrupt
--
that
under
california
law
they
can
search
for
anything
where
he
is
likely
to
commit
another
crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
suppose
they
are
searching
the
suspect's
own
house.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there's
--
he's
used
a
specific
gun.
a
12-gauge
remington
shotgun,
and
they
are
looking
for
that.
and
these
facts
are
the
same.
he
made
--
continued
to
elude
the
police
and
may
attack
again.
and
they
are
searching
the
house,
his
own
house.
they
see
the
one
gun.
they
see
a
second
gun.
they
cannot
take
the
gun,
the
second
gun?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
what
basis
do
you
say
they
can
take
the
second
gun?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
putting
in
my
notes
that
you
are
not
answering
the
hypothetical.
