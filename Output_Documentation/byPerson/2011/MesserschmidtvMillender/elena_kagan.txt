what's
the
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
srinivasan,
there
are
two
categories
of
materials
here,
one
is
the
search
for
other
guns
and
the
other
is
the
search
for
anything
relating
to
gang
membership.
if
we
think
that
those
two
categories
present
different
questions,
if
we
think
that
one
is
more
beyond
a
balance
than
another,
that
an
officer
might
have
qualified
immunity
from
let's
say
the
guns
but
not
the
evidence
of
gang
membership,
what
would
happen
in
this
case
at
that
point?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
the
question,
mr.
srinivasan,
is
do
you
think
that
the
current
test,
the
test
that's
currently
formulated,
is
sufficiently
protective
of
police
officers?
or
do
you
think
that
we
need
to
change
the
test
in
order
to
give
police
officers
the
protection
they
need?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
wolfson,
it
seems
that
many
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides
are
very
fact-dependent
in
nature,
that
you
are
asking
what
inferences
can
be
drawn
reasonably
from
certain
facts,
from
a
particularly
violent
incident,
from
the
use
of
a
sawed-off
shotgun,
from
the
fact
that
this
was
not
his
home,
from
the
fact
that
he
was
a
gang
member;
and
yet
the
cases
that
you
cite
to
us
as
suggesting
what
a
reasonable
police
officer
should
know,
really
are
not
cases
that
involve
these
facts
at
all.
they
are
cases
that
state
very
broad
general
propositions
about
fourth
amendment
law.
so
how
can
you
get
from
those
cases
to
what
you
are
saying
a
particular
police
officer
in
a
particular
set
of
circumstances
ought
to
know?
justice
elena
kagan
but
--
no.
but
there
seems
to
be
a
very
large
gap
between
what
this
police
officer
has
to
think
about
and
the
cases
that
you
cite.
