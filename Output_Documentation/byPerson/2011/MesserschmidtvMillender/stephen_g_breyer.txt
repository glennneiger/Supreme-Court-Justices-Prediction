justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
what
extent
are
we
supposed
to
take
things
that
aren't
in
the
affidavit
or
the
warrant
itself
as
relevant?
i
mean,
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
as
i
read
the
affidavit,
it
doesn't
say
someone
else
is
living
in
the
house.
at
least
i
didn't
see
that.
and
then
the
statement
of
justice
sotomayor
said:
well,
that's
later
on
in
a
deposition.
so
--
so
if
i
were
the
magistrate
sitting
there
and
i
read
the
--
the
affidavit,
i
might
think
i
did
have
cause,
at
least
it's
close,
maybe,
to
allow
them
to
search
for
all
the
guns
in
the
house.
i
might
think
they
all
belong
to
him.
and
anyway,
i
might
think
he
thought
that
this
could
be
used
to
--
other
guns
could
be
used
to
go
after
her
again.
but
when
i
read,
he
says:
oh,
i
had
no
cause
at
all
for
thinking
that.
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
it,
if
we're
supposed
to
take
that
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't
say
much
about
the
gang.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
you
a
specific
question.
i
mean
if
i
were
supposed
to
take
into
account
his
statement,
i
had
no
reason
--
to
paraphrase
it
a
little
--
thinking
that
any
of
these
guns,
other
guns,
were
going
to
be
used
for
any
purpose
that's
illegal
--
if
he'd
said
that
afterwards,
if
i
take
that
into
account,
i
say,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
he
has
no
cause
to
ask
for
the
other
guns,
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
that
was
the
question,
i
think
roughly,
that
you
were
being
asked
and
i
would
like
to
hear
the
answer.
i
thought
the
answer
would
be:
i
don't
have
the
right
to
take
it
into
account.
now,
do
i
or
don't
i?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
before
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
before
the
--
do
i
look
at
the
affidavits
and
the
warrant,
or
do
i
also
look
at
things
that
are
in
neither
of
those
documents,
but
were
in
the
officer's
head?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
i
look
at
whether
he
was
in
good
faith,
if
he
has
any
training
at
all,
i
would
guess
that
if
he
thought
that
there
is
no
--
i
don't
remember
the
exact
words
--
no
reason,
no
reason
to
believe
there
would
be
any
weapons
in
the
house,
no
reason
to
believe
there
would
be
any
handguns
in
the
house,
and
then
i
say,
i
want
a
warrant
to
search
for
handguns
in
the
house,
it
looks
like
you
are
asking
for
a
warrant
to
search
for
that
for
which
you
have
no
reason
to
believe
it's
there.
now,
that
i
would
have
thought
was
not
good
faith.
that
was
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment.
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
you
can
search
a
person's
house
--
why
don't
i
search
the
person's
house
for
an
atomic
bomb?
and
i
say:
why
are
you
doing
that?
he
says:
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
it's
there.
but
that
is
a
constitutional
search?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
cause
is
there
to
think
--
what
cause
is
there
to
think
that
the
gang
guns
will
be
used
to
commit
a
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what's
the
difference
between
what
you
just
said
and
the
situation
here?
you
say,
if
he
sees
the
gun
next
to
the
bed,
for
example,
or
in
the
closet,
and
he's
in
the
house
looking
for
the
sawed-off
shotgun,
he
could
seize
it.
he
can't
unless
he
has
probable
cause
to
think
it
might
be
used
for
a
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
so
how
did
that
change?
how
did
that
change
suddenly
because
he
happened
to
see
in
the
house
something
in
the
closet,
and
nothing
else
changed?
why
now
suddenly
can
he
take
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
your
argument
is
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
thinking
that
the
guns
in
the
house,
if
there
were
other
guns,
would
be
used
for
a
crime.
now,
your
opponent,
your
brethren
there,
said
when
i
suggested
that:
oh,
no,
that's
wrong;
there
is
probable
cause
to
think
that
any
guns
in
the
house
would
be
used
for
a
crime.
he
hasn't
killed
the
girl
yet,
and
one
gun's
as
good
as
another.
and
he
might
well
take
one
of
those
other
guns
and
kill
her.
so
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
guns
that
are
in
the
house,
or
at
least
one
could
reasonably
think
so,
would
be
used
for
a
crime.
that
was
his
response.
then,
as
to
whether
they
are
likely
to
be
in
the
house,
well,
we
know
this:
we
know
he
has
a
sawed-off
shotgun,
and
we
know
he
is
a
member
of
a
gang,
which
is
defined
as
a
group
of
people
engaged
in
definable
criminal
activity,
creating
an
atmosphere
of
fear
and
intimidation.
so
people
like
that
have
guns.
and
when
--
where
they
live,
there
may
well
be
other
guns.
so
it
is
reasonable
for
me
to
think
there
are
other
guns
in
the
house
and
reasonable
for
me
to
think
that
other
guns
in
the
house
would
be
used
for
killing
this
girl
if
he
can
get
to
her.
okay,
that's
the
argument.
now,
what's
the
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
don't
have
to
--
you
have
to
show
more
than
that
there
is
no
probable
cause.
you
have
to
shown
it
wasn't
reasonable
to
think
that
there
was
probable
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
is
a
member
of
a
gang
which
often
has
guns,
and
this
expert
knows
that
members
of
gangs
have
guns.
and
the
definition
of
gang
suggests
they
are
likely
to
have
guns,
whether
it's
illegal
to
have
them
or
not
illegal.
that's
how
he
knows
that
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
we
are
using
a
purely
objective
standard,
another
fact
that
i
just
want
your
reaction
on
is
where
he
says:
"i
told
you
never
to
call
the
cops
on
me.
"
now,
he
has
tried
to
throw
her
out
of
the
window
or
something,
he
--
he's
shot
at
her,
he's
tried
to
kill
her
in
five
different
ways,
and
he's
shouting:
i
am
going
to
kill
you
and
i
told
you
never
to
call
the
cops
on
me.
when
i
first
read
that
i
thought,
well,
maybe
he
has
something
--
maybe
this
is
explained
in
part
not
just
domestic,
but
he
has
something
to
hide.
he's
afraid
she's
going
to
tell
the
police
something.
now
--
now,
could
a
person
reasonably
read
those
words
and
think
he
has
something
to
hide
here?
his
--
and
there's
something
going
on
and
it's
not
just
domestic?
where
does
that
lead
us
if
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
we
read
it
that
way?
and
if
we
do
read
it
that
way,
where
does
that
lead
you?
