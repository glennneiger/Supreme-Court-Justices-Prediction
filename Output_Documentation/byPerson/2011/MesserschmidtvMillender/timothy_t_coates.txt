mr.
timothy
t.
coates
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
malley
v.
briggs
and
united
states
v.
leon,
this
court
set
forth
a
very
high
standard
for
denying
qualified
immunity
in
the
civil
context
or
suppressing
evidence
in
the
criminal
context
under
circumstances
where
a
police
officer
has
procured
a
warrant
that
is
subsequently
determined
to
be
invalid.
specifically,
the
court
held
that
the
initial
magistrate's
determination
is
--
is
entitled
to
great
deference,
and
that
you
will
go
behind
that
only
in
cases
where
the
officer
falsified
information
or
omitted
exculpatory
information,
where
the
affidavit
was
bare-bones,
or
there
was
some
indication
that
the
judicial
officer
did
not
perform
the
function,
and
then
a
catch-all
provision,
where
the
warrant
was
so
lacking
in
indicia
of
probable
cause
that
no
reasonable
officer
could
even
submit
it
for
a
magistrate's
determination.
and
specifically
in
malley,
the
court
said
it
had
to
be
the
actions
of
an
officer
that
was
plainly
incompetent
or
knowingly
violating
the
law.
this
case
arises
from
a
ninth
circuit
decision
that
we
submit
does
not
apply
the
court's
standards,
under
circumstances
where
the
officer
submitted,
far
from
a
bare-bones
affidavit,
but
a
highly
detailed,
factual
affidavit
that
we
submit
provided
probable
cause
for
the
search
or
at
least,
under
the
court's
qualified
immunity
jurisprudence,
a
reasonable
officer
could
believe
that
the
warrant
had
probable
cause.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
correct.
there--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--i
don't
know
that
the
court
--
the
court
has
--
in
i
believe
the
exclusion
context
i
think
i
have
seen
it.
i
can't
recall
the
case,
but
i
believe
it
has,
and
the
circuit
courts
certainly
have
talked
about
that,
as
an
indicia
of
good
faith,
the
officer
being
willing
to
submit
his
work
to
someone
else
to
review
it.
so--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
that
--
that's
the
test
that
the
court
has
set
out.
but
it's
a
high
test,
plainly
incompetent
or
knowingly
violating
the
law.
and
i
think
these
are
additional
factual
circumstances
that
show
at
least
the
officer
is
trying
to
be
careful,
that
this
isn't
something
that's
been
--
been
tossed
off.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no.
i'm
just
saying
that--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--no.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
certainly
not.
and
as
i
say,
this
comes
up
in
the
qualified
immunity
context
repeatedly
among
the
circuit
courts.
they've
recognize
it
as
a
--
as
a
factor.
but
it
is
not
dispositive,
not
by
any
means.
i
agree
with
--
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the
way
that
has
generally
come
up
has
not
been
in
the
validity
of
the
warrant
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
in
terms
of
qualified
immunity
for
the
officer
or
exclusion
of
the
evidence
under
--
or
not
--
or
nonsuppression,
rather,
under
the
good
faith
exception.
and
it's
whether
the
officer,
in
light
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
might
not
have
recognized
that
the
warrant
was
deficient
if
the
warrant
otherwise
isn't
--
isn't
bare-bones.
and
i
think
--
leon
itself
in
footnote
23
incorporates
the
harlow
standard
of
totality
of
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
oh,
i
mean,
this
is
not
per
se
a
gang
crime.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
without
a
--
without
a
doubt,
it's
not
a
what
we
consider
a
gangland
crime,
of
one
gang
member
against
the
other.
it's
a
domestic
assault
by
a
gang
member
on
his
girlfriend
with
a
sawed-off
shotgun
in
public,
right
after
police
officers
that
were
there
to
protect
her
had
left.
so
it's
not
gang-related
in
that
sense.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
gang
membership
is
irrelevant
to
the
investigation
in
this
case.
you
know,
as
we
note
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
recognized,
gang
members
have
the
means
to
procure
and
use
weapons
beyond
that
of
ordinary
people.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no,
it
isn't,
because
it's
always
a
fact-specific
inquiry.
the
courts
made
that
clear
in
illinois
v.
gates
and
for
qualified
immunity
in
anderson
v.
creighton.
we're--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
the
gentleman
is
using
a
sawed-off
shotgun,
which
is
a
weapon
associated
with
--
with
gangs.
i
don't
think
it's
a
stretch
for
an
officer
to
think
that
there
might
be
some
connection
to
the
manner
in
which
he
procured
that
weapon,
might
hide
that
weapon--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
that
you
are
investigating.
here
we
have
an
assault,
we
have
a
domestic
assault
with
indications
that
the
gentleman
intends
to
continue
it.
and
indeed
that's
why
the
warrant
is
for
all
weapons;
because
it
would
make
little
sense
to
say
you
can
go
and
you
could
find
a
sawed-off
shotgun--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--correct,
your
honor.
but
the
point
is
that's
to
be
used
to
possibly
tie
mr.
bowen
to
any
weapon
that
was
found.
it's
identification
information.
if
they
found,
for
example,
the
sawed-off
shotgun
there
and
his
gang
colors
with
his
gang
moniker,
that
would
certainly
help
to
tie
him
to
that
shotgun.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
have
some
evidence,
but
you
don't
have
to
stop
just
because
you
have
some
evidence.
i
mean,
you
are
entitled
to
build
your
case
as
strong
as
you--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
if
you
found
the
actual
shotgun
there
wrapped
in
his
--
in
his
gang
--
gang
colors
with
his
gang
moniker,
i
mean,
it
would
make
an
even
stronger
case.
and
i
also
note,
say
you
find
a.
45-caliber
pistol
wrapped
in
his
gang
colors
with
his
gang
moniker.
i
don't
think--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--because,
again,
the
nature
of
gang
membership
is
that
gangs--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--no,
because
i
think
it
depends.
here
we
have
a
crime
that
definitely
involves
a
gun,
involves
an
illegal
gun--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--the
assault,
correct.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
but
the
manner
in
which
he
procures
the
weapon,
might
dispose
of
the
weapon,
the
nature
of
the
weapon
itself.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
again,
the
nature
of
a
sawed-off
shotgun;
it's
an
illegal
weapon
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
augusta
millender's
house,
ms.
millender's
home.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
correct.
no,
he
was
a
foster
son
who
had
come
back
to
stay.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
i
mean,
again,
i
think,
as
he
sets
forth
his
experience
as
a
gang
officer,
and
the
manner
in
which
gangs
dispose
of,
procure
weapons--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--no.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
i
mean,
it's
an
--
it's
an
objective
standard.
it's
what
a
reasonable
officer
would
do
with
the
facts
before
him.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
for
purposes
of
determining
the
fourth
amendment
validity
of
the
warrant,
the
court
has
said
you
--
you
look
at
the
warrant.
under
the
qualified
immunity
test
and
in
the
criminal
suppression
context
of
good
faith,
you
can
go
outside
that
and
look
at
the
totality
of
what
the
officer
knew,
and
if
in
light
of
what
he
knew
whether
he
could
have
believed
it
was
so.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
because
you
--
you
still
have
under
1524(a)(3)
of
the
california
penal
code
the
--
the
ability
to
search
for
items
that
might
be
used
with
the
intent
to
commit
another
crime.
and
i
think
if
this
was--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
again
i
think
--
going
back
here
in
terms
of
--
stepping
back
from
good
faith
as
opposed
to
probable
cause,
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant
that
this
guy
is
a
gang
member.
i
don't
think
it's
unusual
to
think
that,
while
you
might
know
specifically
whether
there's
a
handgun
or
not--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--yes.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
sure.
but
a
--
but
the
standard
is
plainly
incompetent
or
knowingly
violating
the
law,
and
i
think
--
again,
there
is
enough
detail
in
there
that
i
don't
think
it
is
illogical
to
say
there
is
some
connection
between
gang
membership
and
the
possibility
or
even
the
fair
probability
that
there
are
other
weapons
in
a
residence.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
correct.
it's
a
--
it's
a
further
step
back,
because
whether
it's
even
reasonable
for
him
to
ask
the
magistrate
for
a
determination--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--this
is
a
gentleman
who
just
perpetrated
assault
with
a
sawed
off
shotgun.
he
didn't
make
--
specify,
in
terms
of
his
threat,
that
he
was
confining
his
further
attack
to
a
sawed
off
shotgun.
i
just
don't
think
it's
a
stretch
of
logic
for
an
officer
to
believe
that
if
he
found
a.45-caliber
pistol
there
wrapped
in
gang
colors
that
he
should
be
able
to
seize
it
to
prevent--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--correct.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
again,
because
the
evidence
of
gang
--
indicia
of
gang
membership
could
be
used
to
tie
him
to
things
in
the
residence
that
you
might
find,
absolutely.
it's
an
identifying
characteristic
of
bowen.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
sure.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
and
present
in
that
particular
premises,
it
might
show
ownership
or
control,
it
might
show
access
to
the
weapons.
it's
not
relevant
to
that--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
again,
your
honor,
it
ties
him
closer.
it
shows
him
them
at
the
property.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
you
could
find
again,
gang
member
--
indicia
gang
membership
as
to
him.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
correct.
and
he
is
also
a
member
of
several
gangs,
so
you
could
find
unique
colors
for
one
of
his
gangs
and
not
for
the
other.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
a
general
search
is
evidence
that--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--no.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no.
because
it
would
tie
him
to
anything
found
in
that
residence.
again,
if
you
found
a.45
caliber
pistol--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--that
actually
is
in
the
section
that
deals
with
indicia
of
gang
membership.
it
has
been
carved
out
by
respondents
for
the
first
time
as
a
separate
category.
i
note
it
was
not
argued
down
below
that
way,
it
was
not
viewed
at
the
district
court
that
way
and
it
was
not
viewed
by
the
circuit
judges
that
way.
and
i
do
have
to
say
that
we're
sitting
here
looking
at
11
judges
and
like
6
attorneys
have
looked
at
this
and
they
have
never
brought
that
out
separately.
and
now
we
are
saying
that
should
have
jumped
out
to
the
officer's
separately.
i
think
we
cite
case
law
saying
that
you
should
interpret
that
within
the
context
of
the
entire
provision
which
is
the
indicia
of
gang
membership
provision.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
with
respect
to
the
--
the
hypothetical
that
justice
alito
postulated
in
terms
of
finding
other
weapons
there,
and
respondents'
counsel
to
say
well,
we
might
to
on
the
plain
view
doctrine,
i
think
these
are
circumstances
in
which
we
note
that
you
want
to
encourage
officers
when
they
can,
not
to
--
not
rely
on
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement,
and
here
if
anything
the
officers
in
an
abundance
of
caution
attempted
to
get
a
warrant,
contemplating
those
precise
circumstances.
i
don't
think
they
should
incur
liability
for
--
for
going
to
that
extra
step
and
that
extra
precaution.
and
again,
a
step
back
from
whether
there
is
actually
probable
cause,
but
whether
a
reasonable
officer
could
even
believe
that
might
be
the
case
for
purposes
of
sending
it
to
a
magistrate.
i
think
under
those
circumstances
you
want
to
encourage
officers
to
seek
a
magistrate's
determination
and
not
try
and
rely
on
on-the-scene
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
to
try
and
justify
seizing
weapons
under
those
circumstances.
with
respect
to
justice
scalia's
concern
about
the
probable
cause
to
seize
all
guns
as
opposed
to
guns
belonging
to
bowen,
and
i
think
the
notion
is
that
bowen,
being
a
resident
and
that
being
established
for
purposes
of
this
contention
at
this
point,
it's
still
down
at
district
court
but
it
was
assumed
for
purposes
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
he
was
a
resident
--
that
as
a
resident
that
he
would
have
access
to
that
firearm,
and
i
think
this
was
bolstered
by
a
fact,
again
his
status
as
a
gang
member,
we
cite
the
chicago
housing
authority
v.
rhodes
case
which
talks
about
the
manner
in
which
gang
members
often
store
and
use
weapons
at
family
members'
homes.
i
mean,
it's
an
unfortunate
part
of
--
of
the
gang
culture,
so
it's
not
unreasonable
for
an
officer
to
think
there
might
be
probable
cause
at
the
very
least
to
seize
any
weapon
found
there,
even
if
ultimately
facts
developed
that
it
is
in
fact
not
bowen's
weapon.
and
this
also
goes
to
the
indicia
of
gang
membership
and
why
it's
reasonable
even
to
ask,
because
that
may
be
one
of
the
means
by
which
we
could
tie
a
particular
weapon
to
bowen
depending
upon
what
is
found
during
the
search.
this
is
a
very
high
standard
as
established
by
this
court,
which
is
essentially
plainly
incompetent
or
knowingly
violating
the
law.
and
this
is
an
officer
that
has
not
hidden
the
ball
with
respect
to
what
transpired
between
bowen
and
kelly.
he
submitted
it
to
his
superiors
to
look
at;
he
submitted
it
to
an
attorney;
and
while
that
is
not
dispositive,
i
think
those
are
objective
facts
that
a
reasonable
officer
could
say,
i
have
done
this,
this
and
this;
there
is
no
reason
for
me
to
believe
that
i
am
violating
the
law
in
sending
it
to
a
magistrate.
