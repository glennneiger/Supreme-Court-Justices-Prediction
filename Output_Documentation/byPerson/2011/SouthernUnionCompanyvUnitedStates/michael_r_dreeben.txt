mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
oregon
v.
ice,
involves
the
kind
of
finding
that
the
common
law
never
entrusted
to
the
jury.
there
is,
therefore,
no
erosion
or
encroachment
on
the
jury
function
by
assigning
the
function
of
determining
the
days
of
violation
to
the
court
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
criminal
fine.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court's
statement
in
ice
that
if
a
purely
algebraic
application
of
apprendi
were
followed
it
would
sweep
in
things
such
as
fines
and
restitution
was
not
necessary
to
the
judgment,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
was
part
of
the
court's
rationale
in
adopting
a
different
take
on
the
meaning
of
the
apprendi
line
of
cases
then
had
previously
been
espoused.
up
until--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i
think
that
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
ice
was
citing
to
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
states
which
supplied
illustrations
of
fine
statutes
that
it
believed
would
be
imperilled
by
a
purely
programmatic
rule-based
application
of
apprendi.
and
two
of
the
state
statutes
that
were
cited
in
that
amicus
brief,
that
of
new
jersey
and
alaska,
involved
the
kind
of
gain
or
loss
statute
that
has
been
discussed
this
morning,
in
which
the
judge
following
the
rendition
of
a
guilty
verdict
determined
the
amount
of
gain
or
loss
and
then
applied
either
a
double
or
triple
amount
as
the
maximum
fine.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
the
tradition
with
respect
to
monetary
fines
is
different
than
the
tradition
that
the
court
analyzed
in
apprendi.
with
respect
to
fines,
restitution
and
forfeiture,
the
jury
was
never
given
a
substantive
role
at
common
law.
and
the
law
today
is
with
respect
to
forfeiture--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
what
apprendi
relied
on
primarily
was
the
linkage
between
charge
and
penalty
in
english
law,
which
was
for
felonies
death.
the
court
distinguished
in
a
footnote
the
tradition
with
respect
to
misdemeanors,
which
it
acknowledged
was
judicial
discretion
with
respect
to
fines
and
whippings,
and
it
did
not
rely
on
that
history
in
fashioning
the
apprendi
rule.
what
it
relied
on
were
two
things:
first,
the
traditional
linkage
between
charge
and
authorized
penalty
in
english
common
law,
and
second
the
tradition
in
america
that
when
the
legislature
had
put
a
cap
on
the
amount
of
the
penalty,
the
judge
had
discretion
within
it
not
to
go
above
it.
but
neither
of
those
aspects
of
apprendi
addressed
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
today,
which
is
whether
it
would
be
an
expansion
beyond
the
domain
that
was
covered
in
apprendi
to
apply
it
to
monetary
penalties
in
the
form
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
difficult
to
do
that,
justice
sotomayor,
because
the
court
fashioned
the
apprendi
rule
from
history
and
it
limited
it
based
on
history
in
ice.
it
doesn't
operate
as
an
algorithm
that
simply
applies
automatic--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
and
that
was
the
argument
of
the
ice
dissenters,
that
apprendi
states
a
rule
that
knows
no
exceptions
for
history
or
the
impact
on
the
states.
and
ice
does
represent
i
think
a
--
it
shows
where
the
high
water
mark
of
apprendi
was.
the
high
water
mark
was
with
respect
to
the
penalty
of
imprisonment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
of
course
the
death
penalty
in
ring
v.
arizona.
the
court
held
that
facts
that
exposed
the
defendant
to
the
death
penalty
must
be
found
by
the
jury.
so
the
court
has
extended
apprendi
to
those
court
of
liberty
areas.
but
even
with
respect
to
the
implication
for
the
length
of
imprisonment,
the
quantum
of
punishment
that
a
defendant
faces
when
he
is
convicted
of
multiple
offenses,
this
court
in
ice
looked
to
history
and
the
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
before
being
willing
to
extend
apprendi
outside
of
its
core
domain.
and
i
think
it's
highly
relevant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
is
of
course
relevant,
justice
kagan.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
the
court
went
on
several
paragraphs
later
in
its
opinion
to
describe
what
it
would
mean
to
adopt
a
formulaic
complication
of
apprendi,
treating
it
just
as
a
rule
divorced
from
history.
and
one
of
the
consequences
that
the
court
considered
was
the
impact
it
would
have
on
sentencing
accoutrements,
two
of
which
are
directly
related
to
this
case
because
they
are
financial
penalties,
fines
and
restitution.
now,
i've
talked
about
how
the
amicus
brief
that
prompted
that
paragraph,
the
concern
about
implications
of
expanding
apprendi
referred
to
fine
statutes
that
operate
on
a
gain
or
loss
basis
which
necessarily
requires
judicial
fact
finding
after
the
guilty
verdict
comes
in.
but
if
the
court
isn't
satisfied
with
those,
restitution
which
is
explicitly
mentioned
in
apprendi
--
excuse
me,
in
ice,
classically
operates
based
on
findings
about
victim
loss
that
occur
after
the
guilty
verdict
has
come
in.
this
court
is
well
familiar
that
oftentimes
courts
have
to
postpone
sentencing
in
order
to
allow
the
victim
to
gather
evidence
and
to
present
it.
now
the
court
could,
i
suppose,
do
as
the
lower
courts
have
done
and
say
restitution
is
different
because
it's
designed
simply
to
compensate
for
loss
and
therefore
it's
in
one
sense
remedial.
but
that
will
have
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
in
cases
like
pasquantino
v.
united
states
and
pennsylvania
v.
davenport,
the
court
has
described
restitution
as
a
criminal
penalty.
now
the
other
way
in
which
lower
courts
have
said
that
restitution
isn't
swept
up
by
apprendi
is
to
say
that
it's
a
rule
that
has
no
maximum.
whatever
the
amount
of
harm
to
the
victim
is,
that
can
be
compensated
through
restitution.
but
again,
if
one
is
applying
an
algebraic
understanding
of
the
relevant
statutory
maximum
from
the
blakeley
decision,
restitution
would
be
hard
to
justify
because
the
jury
verdict
does
not
contain
findings
about
harm
to
victims.
the
jury
verdict
finds
guilt,
afterwards
the
judge
finds
an
additional
fact,
namely
the
amount
of
harm
and
imposes
restitution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
uh-huh.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
probably--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
probably,
mr.
chief
justice,
such
a
statute
would
be
construed
to
make
that
fact
one
for
the
jury,
since
it
dictates
imprisonment
increases
as
well
as
fine
increases.
and
so
the
constitutional
question
is
unlikely
to
arise.
congress
would
have
been
deemed
to
have
intended
that
that
kind
of
a
fact
go
to
the
jury.
that's
not
what
--
the
case
in
this
statute.
this
statute
provides
a
5-year
maximum
penalty,
and
then
it
provides
a
fine
amount
that's
graduated
to
the
days
of
the
violation.
the
violation
in
this
case
was
one
single
violation.
the
judge
did
not
find
that
there
were
multiple
violations;
the
judge
simply
looked
at
the
record,
and
his
task
is
to
decide
how
long
did
that
violation--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
do--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
court
has
never
recognized
jury
nullification
as
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
we
presume
a
rational
jury.
we
presume
that
if
the
jury
is
confronted
with
the
evidence
and
the
law
as
given
to
it
by
the
court,
it
will
apply
that
law
in
a
rational
matter.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
that
is
something
that
the
jury
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
do.
now,
coming
back
to
the
historical
foundations
of
the
apprendi
rule
and
the
extension
that's
requested
here,
with
all
due
respect
to
petitioner,
i
think
united
states
v.
tyler
is
much
more
significant
than
petitioner
gives
it
credit
for.
this
is
a
case
decided
in
1812
on
a
court
that
had
on
it
chief
justice
marshall
and
justice
story.
these
were
people
who
were
well-steeped
in
common
law
traditions
and
well-familiar
with
how
judges
would
find
facts
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
and
in
tyler,
there
was
a
charge
that
the
defendant
had
unlawfully
exported
in
violation
of
an
embargo
law
an
amount
of
pearl
ashes
that
were
worth
$600.
and
the
jury
came
back
with
a
verdict
that
said
we
find
that
the
defendant
unlawfully
exported
pot
ashes
worth
$280.
and
the
question
is
could
a
verdict
be
imposed
on
this
and
could
the
judge
set
the
fine?
the
two
judges
on
the
circuit
court
disagreed,
and
so
it
was
certified
to
the
supreme
court.
and
this
court
held
unanimously
that
finding
a
valuation
was
a
judge
function,
not
a
jury
function.
no
valuation
was
necessary
in
order
for
the
court
to
impose
the
proper
fine.
and
it's
difficult
to
understand
how
this
court
could
have
said
that
if
there
was
such
a
well-settled
constitutionally
protected
entitlement
to
a
jury
verdict
on
facts
that
dictated
a
fine,
if
indeed
this
statute
assigned
the
role
to
the
judge
and
the
court
was
fully
comfortable
with
that
role
being
carried
out.
and
tyler
is
a
decision
of
this
court.
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
with
respect
to
imprisonment
that
is
anything
like
tyler.
the
traditions
with
respect
to
imprisonment
would
surely
be
understood
in
a
different
manner
than
with
respect
to
fines.
and
when
one
looks
at
fines,
restitution
and
forfeiture
as
a
package
of
financial
penalties
and
asks
the
question,
did
the
framers
envision
that
these
matters
would
be
within
the
jury's
domain
as
opposed
to
the
judges'
in
imposing
the
appropriate
sentence
after
a
jury
verdict,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
they
would
not
have
viewed
it
as
a
matter
protected
by
the
sixth
amendment,
because
there
was
no
factual
predicate
in
the
common
law
that
would
have
led
them
to
believe
the
jury's
function
would
be
eroded
if
those
matters
were
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
could
have
done
it
here,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
broader
concern
is
cases
that
involve
gain
or
loss,
in
which
the
question
of
how
much
loss
may
have
been
suffered
by
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
victims
of
fraud
is
typically
not
undertaken
--
the
process
of
quantifying
them
isn't
done
until
the
guilty
verdict
is
in
because
it's
an
enormously
difficult
and
complicated
task
--
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
the
judge
isn't
even
required
to
do
it
at
sentencing
if
it
proves
to
be
too
complicated.
and
for
jury
trials
to
do
it,
there
may
well
be
a
need
for
bifurcation.
and
this
court
in
oregon
v.
ice
declined
to
impose
on
the
states
the
need
to
bifurcate
trials
to
determine
whether
a
sentence
should
be
run
consecutively
or
concurrently,
because
that
would
intrude
upon
a
valuable
reform
that
was
designed
to
provide
some
restraints
on
judicial
discretion.
the
same
kind
of
thing
would
operate
here
if
this
court
adopts
an
across-the-board
rule
that
fines
have
to
be
proved
to
a
jury.
if
it
extended
it
to
restitution
and
to
forfeiture,
that
would
involve
overruling
the
court's
decision
in
libretti
v.
united
states,
which
held
that
forfeiture
is
a
sentencing
function.
but
upon
a
strict
application
of
apprendi,
a
mathematically
geometrically
accurate
application
of
the
rule
stated
in
apprendi,
it's
difficult
to
see
why
forfeiture
is
not
something
that
has
to
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
agree
with
--
that
it's
later
been
characterized
that
way.
it
was
characterized
in
a
decision
that
was
written
by
justice
story
in
the
same
year.
justice
story
was
on
tyler.
he
wrote
--
he
sat
on
circuit
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
mann
--
and
this
is
in
our
brief.
and
he
--
he
interpreted
tyler
and
said
the
court
would
not
have
given
the
direction
that
it
did,
that
a
judgment
could
be
entered
based
on
the
fine
amount,
unless
they
were
satisfied
that
an
indictment
lay
and
that
the
fine
was
to
be
imposed
by
the
court
and
not
found
by
the
jury
as
a
penalty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
the
court
stated
that
the
part
of
the
verdict
which
is
subject
--
which
we're
discussing
right
now
--
is
to
be
regarded
as
surplusage.
in
other
words,
this
--
tyler
explains
that
although
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
charge
had
asked
for
$600
of
value
which
would
then
be
subject
to
the
fine.
the
jury
found
only
$280.
and
as
i
interpret
the
court's
decision
and
i
think
as
justice
story
interpreted
it
sitting
on
circuit
in
mann,
it
said
this
isn't
a
jury
function.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
again,
i
would
readily
concede,
justice
scalia,
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
appear
in
the
court's
decision
in
tyler,
but
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
that
a
court
that
included
chief
justice
marshall,
justice
story
and
other
members
who
were
well-familiar
with
how
common
law
operated
would
have
adopted
an
interpretation
of
a
statute
that
was
facially
unconstitutional.
i
--
i
don't
submit
that
this
decision
grapples
with
what
we
now
know
to
be
the
apprendi
doctrine.
i
simply
submit
it
as
evidence
that
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
--
they
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
having
read
apprendi
in
order
to
render
their
decision.
they
--
they
were
deciding
the
question
that
was
certified
up
to
them.
my
submission
is
that
they
wouldn't
have
decided
the
case
that
way
if
they
thought,
based
on
their
familiarity
with
the
common
law,
that
fines
were
the
kind
of
thing
that
had
to
go
to
a
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
they
felt
they
did
not
need
it,
because
the
matter
was
sufficiently
obvious
that
all
members
of
a
court
could
agree
with
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
three
of
them.
the
earliest
one
is
commonwealth
v.
smith.
it's
a
massachusetts
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
the
court
in
that
case,
its
analysis
i
think
is
even
briefer
than
the
analysis
we
just
discussed
in
tyler.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
i'd
have
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
opinion
to
tell
you
whether
it
was
an
argued
case.
there's
no
citation
of
any
constitutional
law
in
--
in
that
decision.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
doubt
that
i
would
say
that,
justice
sotomayor.
the
--
the
jurisprudence
of
the
former
colonies/new
states
is
not
uniform.
i
--
the
--
there
is
something
i
think
of
mythology
in
speaking
about
the
common
law
as
one
indivisible
body
of
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
don't
disagree
with
you
on
that
point,
justice
sotomayor;
but
i
think
that
there
is
one
fact
that
truly
stands
out
about
fines,
and
that
is
they
were
historically
at
common
law
products
of
judicial
discretion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
imprisonment
was
rare.
imprisonment
was
hardly
ever
imposed
in
the
early
colonies
and
in
england.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
a
few
did.
and
i've
attempted
to
read
up
on
the
law
of
north
carolina,
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
the
law
of
massachusetts,
the
law
of
new
york.
it's
all
varied
and
complicated,
but
there
were
a
few
of
them
there.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
fact
that
there
were--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
none
of
those
statutes
assigned
to
the
role
of
finding
fines
to
juries.
there
may
be
an
example
or
two
that
one
could
find
if
you
dig
through
the
mass
of
colonial
records,
but
the
dominant
trend,
and
it
was
acknowledged
by
blackstone,
was
that
the
common
law
never
assigned
the
responsibility
of
fines
to
the
jury,
and
statutes
did
so
rarely.
imprisonment
simply
doesn't
help
very
much
in
this
area,
because
the
resources
required
to
imprison
just
didn't
exist,
and
imprisonment
really
is
a
product
that
developed
in
the
late--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
another
one
of
them
is
massachusetts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
right.
hope
in
1845,
which
cites
back
to
smith
and
relied
on
it,
and
then
there
is
an
arson
case
called
ritchey
from
indiana
in
which
the
court
did
seem
to
think
that
in
order
to
sustain
a
proper
prosecution
where
the
fine
amount
varied
based
on
the
destruction
of
the
property,
the
jury
had
to
find
the
amount
of
the
property
valuation.
but
this
is
1845,
it's
not
something
that
would
have
been
present
to
the
mind
of
the
framers.
it
doesn't
indicate
clearly
what
the
source
of
law
is,
whether
it's
a
common
law
tradition,
whether
it's
following
something
like
smith.
smith
itself
i
think
is
also
best
understood
as
a
larceny
case,
and
there
was
more
of
an
established
tradition
that
in
larceny
cases,
the
value
of
the
property
taken
was
relevant
to
the
jury's
findings
because
it
made
the
difference
between
a
capital
offense,
a
capital
offense
that
could
be
given
with
benefit
of
clergy,
which
was
basically
the
way
for
the
english
judges
to
mitigate
a
death-eligible
crime
to
a
non-death
penalty,
or
petty
larceny,
which
was
punished
by
fines
and
whippings.
so
it
graded
the
offense
in
a
way
that
for
example
the
fine
penalty
at
issue
in
this
case
does
not.
petitioner
is
guilty
of
a
felony
by
virtue
of
the
jury
verdict.
that
imposes
the
stigma
of
being
a
felon
on
petitioner.
the
judge's
role
is
then
to
decide
what
was
charged
in
the
indictment
and
what
was
the
length
of
that
violation,
not
to
find
petitioner
guilty
of
numerous
additional
violations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
jury's
acquittal
would
end
the
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
in
that
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--unless
the
judge
finds
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
under
jackson
v.
virginia
he's
bound
by
the
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
then
i
think
that
he
would
be
bound
by
the
day
of
violation,
$50,000
limit,
subject
to
another
provision
of
federal
law,
3573
(c),
which
provides
in
the
case
of
an
organization
that
a
felony
exposes
the
defendant
to
a
$500,000
fine.
so
there
--
there
would
be
other
limits
applicable
in
federal
law
that
would
explain
what
the
judge
is
supposed
to
do
in
that
situation.
the
judge,
of
course,
is
operating
in
a
different
way
than
the
jury.
the
jury
is
finding
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
judge
is
applying
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
this
court
in
united
states
v.
watts
has
recognized
that
judges
can
find
facts
that
the
jury
may
have
rejected
under
the
higher
standard.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
only
the
whole
problem,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
only--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
only
a
problem,
justice
scalia,
if
the
sixth
amendment
protects
a
defendant's
right
to
it.
and
the
question
that
was
--
as
framed
in
ice,
is
whether
the
legislative
innovation,
the
reform
aimed
to
structure
the
discretion
of
a
court
which
at
the
founding
era
might
have
been
impose
whatever
fine
you
like,
with
no
limits
whatsoever,
except
the
excessive
fines
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
--
congress
has
come
along,
as
have
the
state
legislatures,
and
sought
to
structure
the
deliberations
with
respect
to
financial
penalties.
fines,
restitution
and
forfeiture
are
now
structured
in
a
way
that
basically
sends
the
decision
to
he
judge
or
lowers
the
standard
of
proof
to
a
preponderance
in
the
case
of
forfeiture
amounts
that
--
that
are
decided
by
a
federal
jury
without
the
constraints
of
the
apprendi
rule.
and
that
distinction
between
financial
penalties
and
infringements
on
life
or
liberty
is
consistent
with
a
sixth
amendment
theme.
deprivations
of
life
or
liberty
attract
a
greater
degree
of
protection
than
fine
amounts
or
other
financial
penalties.
there
is
substantive
constitutional
protection
in
the
eighth
amendment--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
the
right
to
counsel
area,
the
court
has
held
that
for
misdemeanors,
if
the
defendant
goes
to
prison
he
is
entitled
to
counsel,
if
the
defendant
does
not,
he
is
not
entitled
to
counsel.
with
respect
to
jury
trials,
a
petty
offense
which
is
generally
one
punishable
by
less
than
6
months
in
prison,
there
is
no
jury
trial
right.
a
penalty
of
greater
than
6
months
in
prison
indicates
a
more
serious
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
still
a
misdemeanor
because
the
primary
indication.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
--
that
is,
this
court's
jurisprudence;
this
court
in
scott
and
argersinger
draw
the
line
at
actual
imprisonment,
recognizing
that
deprivations
of
liberty
have
a
more
serious
criminal
implication
than
financial
penalties.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is,
of
course,
an
important
constitutional
value
in
deprivations
of
property.
it's
protected
by
due
process
and
the
excessive
fines
clause
explicitly
addresses
the
possibility
that
the
judge
may
impose
an
unjustified
penalty.
there
are
also
nonconstitutional
sources
of
protection
such
as
reasonableness
review,
which
petitioner
got
in
this
case,
and
the
first
circuit
upheld
the
amount
of
the
fine
as
reasonable.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
despite
the
lack
of
a
historical
pedigree,
and
despite
this
court's
decision
in
tyler,
and
despite
the
adverse
affect
on
the
administration
of
justice,
the
apprendi
rule
needs
to
be
expanded
where
it
has
never
been
applied
previously
to
encompass
fines.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
liberty
in
the
sense
of
imprisonment
is
not
involved.
corporations
i
don't
think
can
be
deprived
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
a
corporation
could
be
deprived
of
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
can't
be
put
in
prison;
it
can't
be
restricted
from
you
know,
activities
that
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
corporations
can
appear
in
court
except
through
counsel.
they
don't
have
a
sort
of
distinct--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
this
is
a
rule
that
is
responsive
to
the
history
with
respect
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--may
i
answer?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
its
apprendi
line
of
cases.
we're
asking
it
to
apply
the
analysis
that
limited
apprendi
in
oregon
v.
ice.
thank
you.
