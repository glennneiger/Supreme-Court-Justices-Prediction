mr.
phillips,
do
you
think
that
you
could
say
that
there
was
no
going
above
the
statutory
maximum
here?
in
other
words,
you
know,
if
the
judge
had
said
well,
it's
$500
a
day,
i'm
going
to
find
some
facts
and
fine
you
$600
a
day,
that
would
be
going
above
a
statutory
maximum.
but
i'm
wondering
whether
this
is
different
because
here
the
judge
was
sticking
to
the
$500
a
day
that
was
set
out
in
the
statute,
and
then
the
question
is
more,
you
know,
of
an
out
--
is
it
an
element
or
is
it
a
--
is
it
a
sentencing
fact
as
to
how
many
days
the
violation
occurred?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
dreeben,
wasn't
the
core
domain
defined
by
whether
it
related
to
a
specific
statutory
offense?
so
ice
says
"the
core
concern
is
a
legislative
attempt
to
remove
from
the
province
of
the
jury
the
determination
of
facts
that
warrant
a
punishment
for
a
specific
statutory
offense.
"
how
is
that
not
relevant
precisely
in
this
context.
justice
elena
kagan
how
does
it
not
determine
this
context.
justice
elena
kagan
what
other
rules
do
you
think
are
different?
i
mean
is
there
a
jury
trial
in
the
one
case
but
not
in
the
other?
is
there
a
right
to
counsel
in
one
case
but
not
in
the
other?
what
else
turns
on
this
fine/incarceration
distinction?
