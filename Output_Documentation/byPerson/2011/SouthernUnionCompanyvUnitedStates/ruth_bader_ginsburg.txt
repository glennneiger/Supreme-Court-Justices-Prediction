justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
--
the
jury
didn't
say
that
the
defendant
was
in
violation
only
1
day.
it
said
it
was
in
violation
within
this
span
of
many
months,
and
it
didn't
say
how
many
days.
it
didn't
say
whether
it
was
every
day
or
1
day
or
10
days.
it
just
didn't
focus
on
the
number
of
days.
but
it
didn't
find
that
they
were
in
violation
only
1
day,
which
is
what
your
opening
statement
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
an
objection
at
trial
to
the
charge
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
instruct
the
jury
to
find
the
number
of
days
of
violation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
make
of
this
old
case
that
the
government
cites,
u.s.
v.
tyler?
and
it
was
the
question
of
--
the
penalty
was
four
times
the
value
of
the
goods,
and
this
court
said
the
judge,
not
the
jury,
is
responsible
for
imposing
the
fine
and
therefore
also
for
determining
the
value
of
the
goods.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
i
think
the
reference,
it
was
a
fleeting
reference
to
fines
and
it
could
have
meant
that
the
judge
has
discretion
to
set
fines
up
to
the
maximum
in
the
statute.
that's
one
possible
meaning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
amount
of
loss
issue
that
justice
breyer
raised
with
--
very
complicated
to
determine
what
the
amount
of
the
loss
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
--
if
--
on
the
question
of
the
value
of
goods
or
the
amount
of
the
loss,
what
would
the
standard
be?
would
the
jury
have
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
is
--
the
value
was
such-and-such?
