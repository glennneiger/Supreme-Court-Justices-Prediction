mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
its
landmark
decision
in
apprendi,
this
court
announced
as
a
fundamental
principle
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
that
every
fact
necessary
to
increase
the
punishment
beyond
that
which
is
otherwise
maximally
provided
for
must
be
presented
to
the
jury
and
must
be
decided
by
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
this
particular
case,
the
defendant
was
fined
a
total
of
an
$18
million
penalty
in
the
context
of
a
jury
finding
that
there
was
a
single
day
of
violation
under
the
rcra
provision.
congress
is
quite
explicit
that
the
maximum
fine
for
a
single
day's
violation
is
$50,000.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
believe
the
jury
trial
was
constitutionally
required,
justice
scalia.
the
cutoff
between
what's
a
petty
offense
not
subject
to
jury
trial
and
what
is
beyond
that,
i
think
you
could
get
there
two
ways.
this
is
a
crime
that
congress
attaches
a
5-year
penalty
to
if
it's
against
an
individual,
which
suggests
that
it
is
a
very
serious
crime.
and
the
maximum
fine
under
the
district
judge's
interpretation
of
this
would
have
been
$38
million,
even
though
the
judge
chose
only
to
impose
an
$18
million
penalty
under
the
circumstances.
so,
either
way,
it
seems
to
me
clearly
a
serious
offense.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
haven't
used
the
word
--
i
mean,
the
distinction
is
between
a
serious
offense
and
a
petty
offense
and
the
places
where
you
have
drawn
the
line
to
conclude
that
a
fine
was
too
small
to
be
worried
about
was
$10,000
in
the
muniz
case.
you
recognized
in
bagwell
that
$52
million
was
way
beyond
what
would
be
appropriate
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
the
court
benefits
most
if
it
just
focuses
on
the
potential
penalties
that
congress
has
adopted
and
use
that
as
the
guidepost,
because
if
congress
has
said
that
this
is
something
for
which
someone
could
be
punished--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
absolutely.
and
we
asserted
our
right
to
a
jury
trial.
and
the
government
didn't
contest
our
right
to
a
jury
trial.
and
i
don't
actually
read
their
brief--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
couldn't
be
clearer,
that
it
says
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
--
the
accused
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
and
all
--
and
you
know,
article
iii,
section
2,
says
in
all
jury
trial
--
in
criminal
prosecutions
there's
a
jury
trial.
so
there
is
no
effort
whatsoever
to
limit
the
--
the
individual,
or
in
any
way
to
--
the
person
or
persons
or
entities
that
are
entitled
to
those
rights.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
would
have
been
--
we'd
probably
have
had
a
different
outcome
if
that
had
been
the
case.
but
no,
your
honor,
obviously
"peers"
in
that
context
is
--
is
derived
from
the
citizenry
in
the
state
or
the
district
in
which
the
prosecution
is
brought.
i
mean,
obviously
we
don't
get
corporate
peers
in
that
sense,
but
that
--
but
no
one
has
ever
doubted
that
an
ordinary
jury
would
be
a
suitable
jury
of
peers
for
corporations,
and
candidly,
corporations
are
tried
all
the
time.
and
no
one
has
doubted
it.
and
i
don't
think
it
--
you
know,
first
of
all,
it
seems
clear
under
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
article
iii
that
corporations
are
entitled
to
a
jury,
and
that
no
one
is
--
in
anything
that
is
a
serious
offense,
and
that
clearly
is
what
we
have
here.
and
so
what
we've
got
is
a
decision
by
the
jury
that
there
was
at
a
--
at
a
single
point
in
time
a
violation
of
rcra.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
what
the
--
what
the
first
circuit
said,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
--
the
most
you
could
read
the
jury
to
have
found,
because
it
was
not
asked
the
question,
the
most
you
could
read
out
of
it,
was
that
there
was
a
single
day
of
a
violation,
and
that
that
then--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
most
you
must
read
out
of
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
they
could
have.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
that
therefore,
if
you
apply
the
core
apprendi
doctrine
in
a
principled
way,
as
justice
kennedy
suggested
in
a
separate
concurrence,
if
you
applied
it
in
a
principled
way,
you
determine
what
facts
are
supported
by
the
jury's
findings
and
how
far
does
the
penalty
take
it,
and
it
goes
to
$50,000,
and
anything
beyond
the
$50,000
is,
if
it's
found
by
the
judge,
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
sixth
or
fifth
amendment
under
those
circumstances.
that
should
be
in
my
judgment
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
the
first
circuit
rejected
that
argument
by
turning
to
oregon
v.
ice
and
suggesting
that
there
was
a
fundamental
shift
in
how
the
court
applies
the
apprendi
doctrine.
and
i
--
i
would
suggest
to
you
that,
although
you
are
clearly
better
positioned
to
determine
what
you
thought
you
meant
by
ice
than
i
am,
my
interpretation
of
ice
is
that
it
deals
with
the
very
different
situation
of
multiple
offenses
and
the
very
different
problem
of
trying
to
extend
the
apprendi
doctrine
to
the
context
of
multiple
convictions,
and
then
adopted
a
methodology
for
applying
it
in
those
circumstances
that
focused
significantly
on
a
particular
history
of
consecutive
versus
concurrent
sentences--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--more
so
than
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
more
so
than
i
do.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
--
the
problem
with
that
analysis,
justice
breyer,
is
i
don't
think
the
history,
first
of
all,
is
anywhere
near
as
clear
in
this
context
as
it
was,
for
instance,
in
ice
in
terms
of
who
decided
what.
it
is
--
there
is
no
history
that
suggests
that
judges
had
the
authority
to
impose
fines
beyond
whatever
the
maximum
statutory
limit
that
was
provided
for
by
the
legislature
involved.
and
if
you
--
and
if
you
go
through--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
it
never
was
traditionally
up
to
the
judge
to
go
beyond
whatever
the
maximum
sentence
provided
was.
justice
thomas's
concurrence
in
apprendi
spends
a
significant
amount
of
time
with
that
history.
he
several
times
references
jury
--
i
mean
fines
and
jury
determinations
and
consistently
finds
that
the
same
rule
applies
in
the
fine
context
as
applies
in
the
--
in
the
incarceration
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
justice
kagan,
i
would
have
thought,
if
anything,
our
case
would
be
a
much
easier
one,
because
what
you
--
what
you
basically
are
saying
is
that
the
district
judge
on
the
basis
of
a
non-reasonable
doubt
standard
and
without
a
jury
is
making
a
determination
that
there
have
been
761
violations
of
federal
law,
and
on
that
basis
imposing
a
sentence.
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
whatever
else
you
might
want
to
say
apprendi
should
limit,
it
would
be
the
whole
idea
that
the
judge
gets
to
determine
every
aspect
of
all
elements
of
the
crime
and
the
punishment
that
attaches
to
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
united
states
didn't
object
to
that;
no,
your
honor.
actually
we
didn't
object
to
it
either
and
it
wasn't
an
instruction
that
was
offered
by
either
of
the
parties.
the
judge
actually
was
the
one
who
divined
the
instruction
with
respect
to
a
single--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
--
yeah,
we
didn't
submit
an
instruction.
on
the
other
hand,
neither
side
submitted
the
particular
instruction
that
the
judge
adopted
in
this
particular
case.
but
what
i
think
is
important
is
to
put
it
into
the
context
of
the,
of
the
evidence
at
trial
and
the
way
it
was
analyzed
by
the
first
circuit
under
the
harmless
error
standard.
remember
that
the
issue
here
is
not
that
they
simply
have
mercury
in
a
particular
location
without
a
permit.
the
question
was,
did
they
--
were
they
holding
it
with
an
intent
to
recycle
it
at
some
point
and
to
make
it
a
usable
product.
and
there
were
three
different
points
in
time
when
evidence
clearly
demonstrated
an
attempt
to
obtain
an
rfp
to
handle
the
product
in
precisely
that
way,
even
up
to
the
summer
of
2004,
and
the
indictment
only
runs
to
october
of
2004.
so
the
notion
that
it
could
be
a
--
a
significantly
shorter
period,
maybe
not,
maybe
not
just
a
day,
ultimately,
but
clearly
you
can't
--
we
just
don't
know,
because
no
one
asked
under
those
circumstances.
the
first
circuit
said
this
could
not
be
viewed
as
harmless
error,
and
i
think
that
is
not
challenged
by
the
united
states
at
this
stage
in
the
litigation.
and
so
it
seems
to
me,
as
you
say,
justice
kennedy,
you
have
to
evaluate
the
pure
issue
of,
you
have
one
day
of
violation,
that's
the
determination,
and
when
--
and
to
take
the
apprendi
doctrine.
as
it
is
stated,
it's
quite
plain.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
dont
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
the
lower
courts
have
been
pretty
consistent
on
the
question
of
restitution.
restitution
is,
one,
not
a
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
apprendi;
and
two,
it's
indeterminate.
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
it
is
set
by
the
number
of
days--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--which
requires
a
predicate
finding
of
how
many
days.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
the
government
will
have
to
figure
out
what
it,
what
it
--
its
best
take
as
to
the
value
of
the
loss,
and
it's
going
to
have
to
prove
that
if
that's
going
to
be
the
basis
on
which
--
the
fine.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
it's
within
limits,
that
is
fundamentally
different.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
justice
breyer,
i
mean,
my
first
line
of
defense
would
be
the
comment
by
this
court
consistently
that
the
jury
trial
right
doesn't
necessarily
make
for
the
most
efficient
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
i,
i
would
hope
that
the
court
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
let
the
tail
wag
the
dog
in
that
particular
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
recognizing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
ambiguous
--
the
part
of
the
history
that
is
unambiguous
is
the
importance
of
the
jury
as
a
bulwark
against
the
federal
government
and
against
the
judge.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
it
--
up
to
the
maximum.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
then
there
--
then
it's
an
indeterminate
sentence
and,
of
course,
they
are
not
unconstitutional.
the
core
of
apprendi--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
i
think
that
is
what
justice
scalia
--
alito
was
saying.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
they
had
both.
but
the
one
thing
they
didn't
have
is
a
situation
where,
whatever
the
statutory
maximum
was,
the
judge
was
permitted
to
go
beyond
the
maximum
based
on
findings
that
the
judge
offered
up
on
his
part
without
the
benefit
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
was
the
easy
answer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
more
fundamentally,
and
it's
demonstrated
in
a
case
just
like
this
one--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
--
but
these
statutes
don't
speak
to
what
apprendi
was
talking
about,
which
is,
a
situation
where
you
set
a
maximum
above
which
the
judge
is
permitted
to
go.
none
of
the
statutes
that
are
out
there
exist
that
demonstrate
that.
all
--
and
in
all
the
language
and
all
the
discussion
in
justice
thomas's
concurrence
talks
about
up
to
the
--
you
know,
you
have
broad
discretion
up
to
the
maximum.
once
you
go
beyond
the
maximum,
at
that
point
the
jury
trial
right
has
to
kick
in.
and
let
me
say
it
in
this
context.
here's
a
situation
where
the
government
proves
up
its
case
in
the
context
of
a
$50,000
fine,
and
that's
what
the
jury
is
asked
to
decide,
and
it
decides
that,
and
then
the
judge
gets
to
say:
okay,
$38
million
is
now
the
right
number.
if
that's
not
the
tail
wagging
the
dog
within
the
meaning
of
even
the
cases
that
preceded
apprendi,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
fundamental
flaw
in
that
particular
scheme.
the
history
between
fines
and
incarceration
are
essentially
the
same.
what
the
court
said
in
apprendi
should
be
followed
exactly
under
these
circumstances.
ice
should
be
distinguished
on
the
recognition
that
multiple
offenses
are
fundamentally
different
from
single
offense,
and
on
that
basis
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
tyler
is
in
many
ways
kind
of
imponderable.
the
one
thing
that's
clear,
it's
not
a
sixth
amendment
decision.
it
was
not
actually
argued.
all
it
says
is
that
under
this
law
--
and
the
problem,
obviously,
in
this
case
was
they
found
--
you
know,
it
was
--
the
pounds
weren't
the
problem.
the
problem
was
obviously
they
had
identified
one
substance
in
the
indictment
and
the
jury
found
another
substance
in
its
verdict.
and
so
there
was
the
disconnect
there,
and
the
court
basically
said:
we
are
not
going
to
worry
about
that
trifling
under
these
circumstances.
what
it
doesn't
say
remotely
is
that
the
sixth
--
is
that
--
you
know,
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
permit
the
judge
to
make
that
finding
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
could
do
it
that
way
or--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
would
have
thought
the
actually
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
probably
adequate
for
these
purposes
because
it
said
"during
the
entirety
of
the
period
from
september
2002
to
october
2004.
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
well,
i
mean,
look,
if
we
think
we
are
going
to
be
prejudiced
as
a
consequence
of
trying
this
in
a
particular
way,
it
will
be
our
call
whether
or
not
to
waive
the
jury
trial
right
under
those
circumstances.
but
more
fundamentally,
at
least
in
this
particular
case,
obviously
our
position
was,
we
didn't
form
the
intent
at
any
point
in
time
and
--
but,
you
know,
if
ultimately
the
--
the
jury
had
found
that
there
was
some
other
point
in
time,
then
we
will
deal
with
that
issue
as
we
deal
with
it.
but
it
wouldn't
have
been
--
i
don't
think
the
trial
in
this
case
would
have
been
significantly
different.
the
only
thing
that
would
have
been
different
is
that
the
jury
would
have
been
properly
instructed
and
our
jury
trial
right
would
have
been
preserved.
as
it
is
here,
our
jury
trial
right
has
been
savagely
undermined.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
hopefully,
i'll
be
able
to
give
you
back
a
couple
of
those
minutes.
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
start
with
what
seems
to
me
ultimately
the
fundamental
notion
of
the
united
states'
position,
which
is
that
there
is
a
vast
gulf
somehow
between
fines
and
imprisonment.
and
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
within
the
constitutional
structure
to
embrace
that
approach
when
obviously,
property
interests
are
protected
in
the
fifth
amendment;
they're
protected
in
the
eighth
amendment.
and
if
you
go
back
to
blackstone,
where
he
talks
about
inflicting
corporal
punishment
or
stated
imprisonment
for
a
term
which
is
better
than
an
excessive
fine,
that
amounts
to
imprisonment
for
life.
there's
a
recognition
historically
that
fines
have
an
enormous
impact
on
individuals
and
of
course
are
entitled
to
fundamental
constitutional
protections.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government's
approach
there
to
saying
fines
are
off
the
table
and
it's
completely
open
season
on
defendants
under
those
circumstances
is
unjustifiable.
with
respect
to
restitution,
i
already
suggested
to
the
court
all
lower
courts
have
concluded
that
restitution
is
not
within
the
apprendi
doctrine.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
a
problem
under
these
circumstances.
and
--
and
i
don't
think
ultimately
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
sort
of
what
is
or
is
not
the
common
law
tradition.
because
i
--
if
i
go
back
and
i
think
--
i
read
justice
thomas's
concurrence
in
the
history
there,
he
doesn't
even
mention
tyler
as
part
of
--
as
part
of
that
analysis,
and
yet
concludes
with
what
i
think
is
a
very
powerful
assessment,
that
juries
would
be
available
for
fines
up
to,
you
know,
within
--
if
it
were
going
to
go
beyond
some
kind
of
a
maximum.
but
within
the
maximum
obviously
in
that
context,
the
judge
would
have
complete
discretion
on
--
on
how
to
approach
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
worth
considering
two
facts
in
this
case
in
dealing
with
what
i
think
is
purely
a
policy
argument
that
shouldn't
override
the
constitution.
but
the
first
one
is
that
--
the
notion
that
apprendi
applies
to
fines
has
been
well
accepted
in
99
percent
of
the
country
for
more
than
a
decade.
and
the
antitrust
division
operates
and
makes
these
kinds
of
decisions
all
the
time.
fraud
prosecutions
are
going
forward.
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
demonstrates
categorically
they
--
this
--
this
--
it's
done
every
day
and
it
gets
done
effectively.
so
whatever
the
problem
of
apprendi,
it
has
not
surfaced.
and
--
and
you'll
look
in
the
government's
brief
for
any
specific
evidence
of
the
complaint
that
it
makes
other
than
the
hypothetical
possibility
that
they
were
afraid
a
parade
of
horribles
would
be
play
out.
this
court
has
rejected
that
parade
of
horribles
in
every
other
apprendi
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
think
that
is
precisely
what
the
jury
would
be
asked
to
find.
and
juries
are
asked
to
find
that
all
the
time
and
make
that
determination.
and
i
guess
the
last
point
that
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
ought
--
the
court
ought
to
take
notice
of
is
that
no
state
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
that
apprendi
has
not
been
the
problem
in
the
fines
context
that
would
even
warrant
anybody
to
come
in
here
and
complain
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
the
right
answer
is
to
apply
the
core
doctrine,
the
core
principle
of
apprendi,
which
even
the
government
concedes
if
you
just
take
the
language,
it
talks
about
any
fact
that
increases
the
penalty,
that
algorithm
takes
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
do
--
i
mean,
we
do
make
the
--
we
demonstrated
two
things:
one,
that
the
lower
courts
pretty
consistently
have
rejected
the
first
circuit's
approach--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
then
two,
that
the
amicus
brief
then
focused
more
in
terms
of
fines
being
used
on
a
regular
basis
in
that
period
of
time
in
those
jurisdictions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
cede
back
the
rest
of
my
time.
