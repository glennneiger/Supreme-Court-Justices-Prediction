justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
--
i
mean
i
was
--
i
tend
to
be
in
dissent
in
these
cases,
so
i
don't
have
the
authoritative
view.
but
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
no.
but
the
impression
i
have
is
that
--
that
i
had
thought
there
were
what
i
would
call
the
elements
of
the
offense,
and
then
there
were
sentencing
facts.
and
sentencing
facts
have
been
traditionally
facts
found
by
the
judge
when
imposing
a
sentence.
now
the
majority
of
the
court
in
apprendi
went
back
into
the
history
and
said
there
is
no
significant
old
tradition,
old
enough,
of
--
of
sentencing
facts.
so
really
when
you
raise
the
sentence
that's
like
an
element
and
you
should
have
a
jury
trial.
now,
the
argument
here,
one
of
them,
the
government
stresses
--
and
ice
is
the
same
--
is
that
there
is
no
--
the
tradition's
different
where
fines
and
where
multiple
and
concurrent
sentences
were
at
issue.
if
you
go
back
to
the
18th
century
or
earlier,
what
you
will
discover
is
that
the
judge
has
always
had
a
much
greater
role
in
deciding
what
the
amount
of
a
fine
should
be.
and
therefore,
insofar
as
that
amount
rested
upon
some
view
of
the
facts
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
crime
occurred
--
and
it
always
does
--
it
was
the
judge
who
traditionally
found
it,
not
the
jury.
so
those
facts
are
not
like
elements
of
the
crime.
that's
what
i
thought
was
essentially
the
argument.
ice
and
fines
are
on
one
side
of
that
line
and
apprendi
is
on
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
they
are
not
doing
that
here.
what
they
are
deciding
is
a
fact
of
sentencing
is
how
often
this
crime
was
committed.
no
one
can
go
against
the
statutory
limit,
but
rather
it
allows
a
higher
sentence
when
certain
facts
occur.
now,
i
thought
in
apprendi
that
the
history
is
just
what
i'm
saying
it
was
in
--
in
the
fine
case,
but
the
majority
says
to
the
contrary.
and
so
here
it
seems,
even
if
i
was
wrong
in
apprendi,
that
at
least
there
is
enough
discretion
here
to
say,
look,
this
is
traditionally
up
to
the
judge.
now
why
do
you
think
that
isn't
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
goodness,
i
think
there's
lots
of
statutes
that
say
something
like
this,
that
within
limits,
there's
a
particular--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
leave
that
out
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
says,
the
fine:
"the
maximum
fine
is
going
to
be
not
more
than
the
greater
of
the
twice
of
gross
gain
or
twice
the
gross
loss.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
are
going
to
send
that
to
the
jury.
let
me
read
you
the
next
phase,
phrase:
"unless
imposition
of
a
fine
under
this
subsection
would
unduly
complicate
or
prolong
the
sentencing
process.
"
i
point
to
that
next
phrase
to
show
you
that
congress
understands
in
an
antitrust
case,
in
a
rico
case,
in
a
corruption
case
of
different
kinds,
in
an
environmental
case,
it
is
so
complicated
figuring
out
that
kinds
of
things
that
they
excuse
even
the
judge
who
is
experienced
in
this
from
dealing
with
that.
and
under
your
theory,
as
you
just
point
out,
if
apprendi
applies
here,
we
are
suddenly
telling
juries
to
--
they
have
to
under
the
constitution
administer
that
section
18
u.s.c.
3571
which
i
just
read
to
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
i
understand
you
could
say:
that's
what
the
constitution
provides
and
if
you
jury
can't
handle
it,
well,
too
bad.
okay.
but
i
think
we
are
still
in
the
business
of
trying
to
decide
whether
the
constitution
does
provide
that
in
the
case
of
fines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
tail?
is
that
a
tail
that
the
jury
proceeding
is
itself
so
unadministrable
that
even
congress
says:
we
recognize
even
a
judge
couldn't
do
it.
all
right,
now,
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
an
irrelevant
consideration
when
you
are
trying
to
figure
out
whether
an
ambiguous
history
requires
the
jury
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how,
in
general
--
i
mean,
in
the
individual
case,
very
offer
a
trial
doesn't
come
up
because
90
percent
or
more
of
the
time
it's
just
a
question
of
the
plea
bargain,
and
therefore
the
defendant
doesn't
--
this
is
an
added
weapon
for
him,
apprendi.
but
in
your
--
with
your
clients
and
others,
there
might
be
quite
a
lot
of
trials.
so
how
in
a
trial
does
your
client
or
others
in
that
position
defend
on
the
ground
of:
we
didn't
do
this
at
all;
but
by
the
way,
in
case
you
decide
to
the
contrary,
jury,
we
want
to
tell
you
we
only
did
it
monday,
wednesday
and
friday.
[laughter]
how
is
that
supposed
to
work?
do
you
have
two
juries?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other
two?
i
just
--
i
was
very
interested
in
your
colloquy
here.
you
said,
well,
there
were
three
cases
in
the
19th
century
where
they
did
say
the
jury--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
one
of
them
was
a
very
brief
opinion
from
massachusetts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
massachusetts
counts
in
its
favor,
but
perhaps
the
brief
opinion
doesn't.
the
--
what
about
the
other
two?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both
massachusetts.
well,
that's
extraordinary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
need
any
more
than
that?
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
get
into
this?
isn't
it
just
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
tradition
in
the
law
that
juries
rather
than
judges
would
determine
what
used
to
be
called
sentencing
facts;
facts
related
not
to
the
crime,
but
to
the
imposition
of
the
punishment
where
that's
a
fine?
