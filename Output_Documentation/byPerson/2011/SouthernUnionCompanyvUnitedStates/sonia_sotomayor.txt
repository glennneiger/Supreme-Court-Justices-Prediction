justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
no
inducement
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
phillips,
can
you
deal
with
one
policy
argument
that
your
adversary
raised
that
gives
me
some
pause?
and
that
is,
the
number
of
days
is
certainly
something
that
the
jury
here
could
relatively
easily
decided
upon.
it
could
have
looked
at
the
evidence
and
figured
that
out,
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
in
fraud
cases,
in
securities
cases,
sometimes
the
identity
of
victims
is
not
determined
for
months,
till
months
after
the
conviction,
and
the
amount
of
fine
and/or
restitution
is
set
at
sentencing.
what's
going
to
happen
to
all
of
those
statutes--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
--
or
all
of
those
procedures
that
have
been
set
up
by
congress
to
sort
of
set
the
amount
of
loss
and
repayment?
are
all
of
those
subject
to
the
apprendi
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
isn't
--
aren't
fines
indeterminate
here
by
definition,
going
back
to
justice
kagan's
question?
there
is
no
upper
limit
to
how
much
the
fine
could
be
here,
set
--
the
upper
limit
is
set
by
the
number
of
days,
but
why
is
it
different?
why
is
restitution--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
so,
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
how
about
when
a
fine
is
set
by
the
value
of
the
loss?
that's
no
different
than
restitution.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
congress
permitted
in
1790
indeterminate
sentences
as
well,
with
no
statutory
maximum.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
did
both--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--with
respect
to
fines--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
how
you
can
fully
make
that
argument,
because
i
thought
the
history
was
set
forth
fairly
clearly
in
apprendi
that
the
early
history
was
that
nothing
was
given
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
imprisonment
or
fines
because
most
if
not
all
sentences
were
indeterminate.
it's
only
when
states
began
and
the
federal
government
to
experiment
with
determinate
sentences
that
the
apprendi
issue
then
became
live.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
explain
to
me,
other
than
your
reliance
on
ice,
some
sort
of
tradition,
which,
you
know,
we
can
debate
whether
you
can
draw
any
conclusion
from
tradition
in
any
of
these
areas,
whether
it's
imprisonment
or
fines.
tell
me
on
the
logic
of
apprendi,
not
using
ice,
why
fines
are
different,
without
relying
on
history
which
to
me
is
--
i
view
it
as
ambiguous,
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
it
was
fairly
simple
algorithm.
it
says
if
the
statutory
penalty
--
if
a
judge's
fact
finding
can
increase
the
statutory
penalty,
then
that's
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
a
jury
has
to
find
any
fact
that
increases
the
statutory
maximum.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
outside
of
an
imprisonment,
there
is
no
other
penalty
that
congress
could
fashion
because
it
has
no
history
that
wouldn't
be
within
the
purview
of
the
judge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
makes
acceptable
common
law?
let's
assume
there
weren't
50
states
back
then,
but
whatever
the
number
was,
20
states,
and
15
of
them
submitted
it
to
the
jury
and
5
didn't.
does
that
mean
there
was
no
common
law
that
this
was
generally
submitted
to
the
jury?
if
you
can
point
to
one
case,
that's
enough
to
defeat
the
existence
of
a
common
law
view?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
you
see,
that's
my
problem.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
so
was
imprisonment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
many
statutes
had
anything
but
indeterminate
fine
structures?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
statutes
in
the
early
common
law
had
anything
but
indeterminate
fine
statutes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
may
have
just
forgotten,
but
does
your
brief
go
through
the
status
of
what
lower
courts
have
decided
with
respect
to
fines
and
how
they're
dealing
with
them?
i
just
don't
remember
it
as
being
part
of
your
brief,
the
statement
you
just
made--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
case
is
about
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
jury
trial.
in
apprendi
versus
new
jersey,
we
held
that
this
right
requires
that
other
than
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction,
any
fact
that
increases
the
maximum
punishment
for
criminal
defendant
cases
must
be
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
rather
than
to
a
judge
under
a
lower
standard
of
proof.
we
have
reaffirmed
the
apprendi's
rules
numerous
times
in
cases
where
the
punishment
at
issue
was
imprisonment
or
the
death
sentence.
the
question
here
is
whether
apprendi
also
applies
when
the
punishment
is
a
criminal
fine.
we
hold
that
it
does.
this
case
arises
from
the
conviction
of
southern
union
company,
a
natural
gas
distributor.
a
jury
found
the
company
guilty
of
violating
a
federal
environmental
statute.
the
statute
authorizes
a
fine
of
up
to
$50,000
for
each
day
of
violation.
the
jury,
however,
did
not
specify
the
length
of
the
violation.
southern
union
argued
that
the
judge
must,
therefore,
assume
the
violation
was
for
just
one
day
because
any
longer
violation
would
expose
the
company
to
a
larger
maximum
fine
and
thus
amount
to
judicial
fact
finding
in
violation
of
apprendi.
the
district
court,
however,
imposed
a
fine
of
$6
million
and
a
community
service
obligation
of
$12
million,
amounts
much
larger
than
the
one
day
penalty
of
$50,000.
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
recognized
that
this
would
violate
apprendi,
if
apprendi
applied
to
criminal
fines
but
held
that
apprendi
does
not
so
apply.
we
disagree.
for
purposes
of
apprendi,
there
is
no
basis
to
distinguish
criminal
fines
from
imprisonment
or
the
death
sentence.
as
we
have
said
in
oregon
versus
ice,
the
core
concern
of
apprendi
is
to
ensure
that
the
jury
finds
facts
that
weren't
punishment
for
a
specific
statutory
offense.
that
concern
applies
just
as
much
to
fines
as
to
imprisonment
and
the
death
sentence.
like
these
other
forms
of
punishment,
fines
are
frequently
imposed
penal
sanctions.
their
amounts
are
often
determined
by
particular
facts
and
they
can
be
very
substantial
ranging
into
the
tens
of
million
of
dollars
or
greater.
to
allow
judges
to
find
facts
that
set
the
maximum
amount
of
a
fine
would
subvert
apprendi's
purposes.
our
holding
today
is
rooted
in
historical
practice.
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
judges
often
have
much
discretion
in
choosing
what
fine
to
impose,
but
when
as
here,
the
amount
of
a
fine
depended
on
a
particular
fact,
those
facts
were
typically
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
proved
to
the
jury.
this
requirement
manifested
the
common
law
rule
that
all
accusations
against
the
defendant
that
go
into
determining
the
punishment
must
be
proved
to
the
jury
otherwise
the
defendant
would
be
punished
on
the
basis
of
facts
that
he
has
never
been
accused
of.
the
government
makes
several
policy
arguments
for
why
apprendi
should
not
apply
to
criminal
fines
and
we
reject
them
for
reasons
fully
discussed
in
the
opinion.
because
the
first
circuit
held
that
apprendi
does
not
apply
to
criminal
fines,
we
reverse
that
court's
judgment
and
remand
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
in
which
justices
kennedy
and
justice
alito
join.
