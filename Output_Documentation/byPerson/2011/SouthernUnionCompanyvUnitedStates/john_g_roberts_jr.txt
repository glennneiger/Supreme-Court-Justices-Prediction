chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-94,
southern
union
co.
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree,
don't
you,
that
the
statement
in
oregon
v.
ice
was
pure
dicta?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
odd
though,
isn't
it,
i
mean.
to
some
extent,
this
is
a
little
easier
case
for
you,
because
it
does
involve
a
corporation.
but
there
are
statutes
where
the
amount
of
imprisonment
and
the
amount
of
a
fine
can
both
increase
based
on
a
particular
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
under
your
submission
if
you
have,
you
know,
say
a
defendant
is
subject
to
one
year
and
then
if
a
particular
fact
is
found
and
he's
subject
to
two
years,
a
fine
of
20
but
then
40,
the
judge
would
be
constitutionally
prohibited
from
increasing
the
prison
increasing
the
prison
sentence
but
would
be
perfectly
free
to
increase
the
fine--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--probably
in
a
situation
where
the
fine
might
be
a
lot
more
serious
than
the
--
the
time
in
prison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
operated
--
he
operated
in
a
reasonable
way.
but
we
give
juries
the
discretion
to
be
unreasonable.
it
would
not
--
juries
often
compromise.
so
if
the
instructions
and
the
verdict
told
the
jury
you
can
find
the
defendant,
you
know,
guilty
for
1
day,
or
whatever
it
--
is
the
30
million
--
50,000
or
30
million
--
it
would
not
be
at
all
unusual
for
the
jury
to
debate
and
say
well,
let's
find
him
guilty
for
10
million.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
to
carry
that
through,
the
judge
is
constrained
by
reason
in
--
in
a
way
that
the
jury
is
not,
and
that's
sort
of
--
that's
part
of
the
protection
the
sixth
amendment
provided.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
very
--
very
simple
matter
for
the
government
to
ask
for
jury
findings
on
the
questions
at
issue
in
this
case,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
isn't
limited
to
corporations,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-94,
southern
union
company
versus
the
united
states.
