what
have
we
said
is
the
a
standard
for
fines?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
have
we
said
with
reference
to
a
jury
trial
when
fines
are
involved?
does
it
have
to
be
a
substantial
fine
or
do
we
have
a
word
that
we
use?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
the
context
where
the
entire
offense
of
the
corporation
was
consistent
with
what
the
indictment
said.
it
was
between
the
date
on
or
about,
and
there
--
it
would
be
very
strange
under
this
evidence
to
think
that
it
was
only
there
for
one
day,
when
it
was
spilled
and
they
came
back
--
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
there's
--
that's
just
more
a
sense
of
background.
i
--
i
do
think
we
have
to
reach
the
issue
you
--
you
present
as
if
it
were
just
--
as
if
there
were
no
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
like
justice
ginsburg,
i
was
very
surprised
the
government
didn't
allege
--
didn't
stress
waiver
here.
you
didn't
submit
an
instruction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
were
to
prevail,
i
think
it
would
be
a
rather
simple
matter
for
the
parties
to
frame
an
instruction:
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
and
that
the
pollutant
was
retained
for
x
days,
much
as
what
they
do
in
a
drug
case.
that's
one
way
to
do
it.
could
the
government
do
it
by
the
indictment?
could
it
indict
alternatively,
indict
on
count
1
for
10
days,
days,
count
2
for
two
2
days,
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
way
it
often
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
why
i'm
surprised
the
government
waived
it,
and
i
thought
that's
what
the
evidence
showed
anyway.
but
that's
not
before
us.
that's
not
the
way
the
case
is
presented
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
makes
it
clear
to
you
that
there
is
no
overlap
between
property
and
liberty,
so
that
no
matter
how
much
of
your
property
are
taken,
under
what
circumstances,
it's
just
property,
it's
no
liberty
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
want
us
to
write
as
part
of
that
decision
that
no
matter
how
great
the
fine,
liberty
is
not
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
liberty
in
the
sense
of
what
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
say.
