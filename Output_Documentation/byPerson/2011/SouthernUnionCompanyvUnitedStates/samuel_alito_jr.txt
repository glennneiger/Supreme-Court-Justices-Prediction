do
we
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
your
client,
a
corporation,
has
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
are
the
peers
of
the
southern
union
company
that
would
sit
on
the
jury,
other
railroads?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
1790,
in
fact
in
the
first
judiciary
act
and
in
the
crimes
act
of
1790,
congress
enacted
statutes,
criminal
statutes
that
authorized
a
fine
and
left
it
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
were
those
unconstitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
was
no
maximum.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
it's
totally
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge,
that's
fine.
but
if
congress
enacts
a
statute
that
structures
the
fine
and
says,
if
this
is
the
case
then
so
much,
if
that
is
the
case
then
so
much
more,
then
you
have
to
have
a
jury
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
may
be
what
apprendi
said,
but
is
it
consistent
with
the
original
meaning
of
the
jury
trial
right
in
the
sixth
amendment?
these
statutes
give
me
pause
on
that
score.
