justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
jury
trial
constitutionally
required?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
do
that
because
you
have
to
know
whether
--
whether
to
impanel
a
jury
before
the
jury
comes
in
or
before
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
penalty,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
most
--
the
most
you
must
read
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
you
could
--
you
could
say,
it
could
have
meant,
they
could
have
thought
that
they
violated
every
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
say
that
for
sure.
but
one
thing
you
can
say
for
sure
is
that
they
found
that
it
violated
it
1
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
precisely
what
apprendi
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
--
you're
not
arguing
that
this
rule
will
apply
only
to
fines
against
corporations?
it
would
also
apply
to
individuals,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
how
many
days
or
what
the
value
was,
and
so
forth,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
to
have
that
very
important
fact
found
does
not
exist,
even
for
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
let's
talk
about
tyler.
tyler
was
not
argued
before
this
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
one-page
opinion.
it's
later
described
quite
accurately
as
focusing
not
upon
the
amount
of
the
fine,
but
rather
upon
a
misdescription
of
pot
ashes
as
pearl
ashes,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
did
find
it
in
tyler
there,
didn't
it?
the
question
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
wasn't
it?
why
doesn't
that
indicate
what
the
historical
practice
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
did
it
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
don't
think
they
believed
in
the
apprendi
doctrine,
either,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
might
have
felt
that
they
had
argument,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
all
of
the
19th
century
cases
cited
by
justice
thomas's
concurrence
in
apprendi?
fine
cases.
in
which
courts
--
in
which
courts
did
indeed
require
the
amount
of
the
fines
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
massachusetts,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
an
argued
case,
at
least?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
varied
and
complicated,
why
should
we
--
assuming
that
it's
ambiguous,
why
should
we
adopt
the
strange
rule
that
the
jury
has
to
find
the
fact
if
you
go
to
jail
for
two
weeks,
but
doesn't
have
to
find
the
fact
if
the
amount
of
fines
multiplied
by
number
of
days
or
by
anything
else
will
--
will
make
a
pauper
of
you?
why
would
we
adopt
such
a
strange
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
compelled
to
do
--
to
do
so
by
a
clear
common
law
history?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
judge
disagreed
with
the
jury
about
whether
there
was
even
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no.
the
jury
finds
a
violation
but
the
judge
thinks
the
jury
got
it
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
--
how
does
he
pick
the
number
of
days?
he
flips
a
coin?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he
finds,
you
know,
they
could
have
come
out
that
way,
but
--
but
they
were
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
whole
problem.
that
is
indeed
the
whole
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
find
that
this
defendant
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
committed
the
violation
on
so
many
days.
the
jury
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
judge
could
simply
say
well,
you
know,
all
in
all,
probably
they
did
it
--
probably.
more
likely
than
they
did
it
so
many
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
call
it
a
misdemeanor
but
--
but
impose
a
very
heavy
fine?
it's
still
a
misdemeanor?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
have
right
to
counsel.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
don't
need
counsel
on
any
suits
against
corporations,
right?
