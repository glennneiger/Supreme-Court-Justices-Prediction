mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
issue
is
the
content-based
regulation
of
speech,
it
is
the
government,
not
the
speaker,
that
must
steer,
quote,
"far
wide
of
the
prohibited
zone.
"
that
foundational
principle
is
nowhere
in
evidence
in
the
fcc's
current
enforcement
regime,
which
not
only
intrudes
into
the
prohibited
zone
but
also
enforces
the
indecency
ban
in
a
starkly
inconsistent
manner.
a
regime
in
which
government
officials
decide
years
after
the
fact
that
7
seconds
of
rear
nudity
in
this
particular
episode
of
nypd
blue>
["]
is
indecent,
but
40
seconds
of
nudity
including
full
frontal
nudity
in
catch-22>
["]
is
not;
that
expletives
in
a
documentary
about
blues
musicians
is
indecent,
but
even
more
of
those
expletives
in
a
fictional
movie
about
world
war
ii
is
not,
is
constitutionally
intolerable.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
on
--
quite
the
contrary.
this
court
made
clear,
in
particularly
justice
powell's
concurrence
in
pacifica,
that
context
is
all-important.
and
just
look
at
this
case.
despite
--
and
this
goes
directly
to
some
of
these
questions
about
nudity
--
despite
decades
of
denying
complaints
about
televised
nudity,
the
commission
chose
this
case
for
the
first
time
to
sanction
nudity
on
television
in
a
serious
drama
that
had
been
on
for
10
years
that
had
featured
over--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
--
this
is
not
some
sort
of
obscure,
unknown
reason.
this
show
was
run
across
the
country
in
the
last
hour
of
prime
time
which
happens
to
be
from
9:00
to
10:00
p.m.
in
the
midwest
and
mountain
time
zones.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
number
--
yes.
number
one,
it
is
not
a
reasonable
view,
for
reasons
i
will
explain.
it
was
not
sexual
awakening;
this
was
a
portrayal
in
the
context
of
a
story
line
about
the
difficulties
and
embarrassments
of
blended
families.
this
was
an
exploration
of
one
of
the
things
that
happens,
which
is
a
little
boy
stumbles
in
and
watches
a
woman
in
the
quotidian
activity
of
preparing
her
morning
shower.
in
any
event,
the
commission
for
years
had
been
adjudicating
complaints
about
nudity,
and
i
--
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
simply
untrue
--
it
is
simply
untrue
that
this
had
never
occurred
before.

itself
was
in
its
tenth
season.
the
very
first
episode
which
caused
a
lot
of
media
attention
included
a
nude
scene
of
love
making.
it
was
the
subject
of
any
number
of
complaints.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
so.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
if
not,
i
--
i
hope
you
will
tell
me.
first
of
all,
the
--
the
--
both
the
first
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
issues
were
fully
argued
in
front
of
the
commission,
and
the
commission
addressed
them
in
its
decision
in
the
abc
case.
we,
of
course,
didn't
ask
the
--
or
suggest
to
the
commission
that
it
should
no
longer
apply
pacifica
because
the
factual
predicates
for
more
relaxed
scrutiny
didn't
apply,
as
we
didn't
in
the
second
circuit,
because
only
this
court
can
reconsider
the
application
of
that
standard.
so
that's
an
argument
we
are
making
here.
that
argument
is
not
necessary
to
resolving
this
case,
either
on
first
or
fifth
amendment
grounds.
this
broadcast
--
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
ubiquitous
v-chip,
this
broadcast
is
not
actionably
indecent
under
pacifica,
number
one.
with
respect
to
notice
or
the
vagueness
of
the
application
to
this
show,
clearly
this
was
a
shot
out
of
the
blue.
the
commission
cannot
identify
--
i
challenge
the
commission
to
identify
a
single
decision
of
the
commission
issued
before
this
was
broadcast
in
2003
in
which
it
had
sanctioned
any
display
of
nudity,
and
i'm
going
all
the
way
back
to
1978.
mr.
seth

the
"ouch"

mr.

but
i
can
tell
you--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
--
i
think
it's
a
powerful
argument.
let
me
explain
the
ones
that
i
know
of.
1978,
the
commission's
decision

wgbh,
which
complained
about
scenes
of
explicit
nudity
in
"monty
python's
flying
circus":

the
four
or
five
decisions
that
we
cite
--
that
we
discuss
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
and
that
are
appended
to
the
merits

of
the
abc
affiliates
--
i
can't
remember
whether
it's
12
or

but
more
than
a
dozen

itself
that
included

displays
of

seasons.
complained
about
and
not
adjudicated.
that
is
the
backdrop
against
which--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
first
of
all,
we
don't
have
television
broadcasts
over
85
years,
and
since
there
were
no
reported
decisions
of
any
indecency
enforcement
until
pacifica,
i
think
it's
only
fair,
as
you
pointed
out
yourself,
to
look
at
what
the
commission
has
been
addressing.
they're
right
now
--
i
mean,
you
know,
i've
cited
the
ones
that
are
the
subject
of
commission
decisions.
i
haven't
cited
the
ones
--
i
haven't
attempted
to
hypothesize
about
all
the
other
instances,
but
let's
just
look
at
what's
at
stake
here.
because
the
issue,
justice
breyer,
is
not
just
notice
to
abc
in
this
case,
the
question
is
whether
the
standards
--
the
commission's
standards
as
it's
currently
applying
them
are
so
vague
and
capacious
that
they
not
only
permit
arbitrary
action,
but
they
are
engaging
in
arbitrary
action.
right
now,
as
--
as
mr.
phillips
suggested,
the
commission
has
pending
before
it,
which
it
has
not
denied
for
years,
complaints
about
the
opening
episode
of
the
last
olympics,
which
included
a
statue
very
much
like
some
of
the
statues
that
are
here
in
this
courtroom,
that
had
bare
breasts
and
buttocks.
it
--
it
has
refused
to
say
that
catch-22>
["]
--
it's
catch-22>
["]
--
right
over
here,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
well,
there's
a
bare
buttock
there,
and
there's
a
bare
buttock
here.
and
there
may
be
more
that
i
hadn't
seen.
but
frankly,
i
had
never
focused
on
it
before.
but
the
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--could
--
could
abc
or
anybody
else
rebroadcast
the
"roots"
series?
could
it
rebroadcast

["],
which
the
commission
is
now
here
saying,
oh,
no,
no,
no,
that
was
just
our
staff,
that
wasn't
us.
in
the
"saving
private
ryan"
context,
where
the
commission
did
say
as
a
commission:
not
actionably
indecent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
our
brief,
we
don't
suggest
what
the
rule
ought
to
be,
because
a,
it's
not
our
burden;
b,
it's
not
yours;
and
c,
there
are
any
number
of
options.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
sure.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
those
rules
certainly
would
apply.
and
before
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
indecency
proscription
in
the
statute
cannot
be
applied
in
a
constitutional
way.
i
can
give
you
four
different--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
our
--
our
arbitrariness
argument
is
that
we
now
have
a
standard
that
employs
nonexclusive
factors
that
use
capacious,
vague
words
that
can
be
balanced
any
way
the
commission
wants
to
without
explanation
for
what
all
the
factors
are.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
certainly
is
not.
and
i
can
offer
the
court
or
perhaps
the
commission
four
approaches
it
could
take
to
reduce
the
astonishing
vagueness
of
the
current--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
know
the
pages.
let
me
just
--
i
can't
remember
the
pages.
let
me
just
outline
what
i
think
four
different
things
that
could
ameliorate
the
vagueness
of
the
current
regime.
first
of
all,
the
fcc
could
revert
back
to
it's
quote
"emphatically
narrow
enforcement
regime",
which
acknowledged
one,
that
it
had
to
defer
to
reasonable
judgments
of
the
broadcasters,
and
not
exercise
the
--
an
editorial
eye
looking
at
camera
angles,
whether
something
was
or
wasn't
necessary
to
the
message.
number
2--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
am
not
owning
nicole
richie,
and
i
think
the
best
answer
to
the
nicole
richie
point
is
that
there
is
a
scienter
requirement
in
the
statute
that,
you
know,
would
preclude
the
application
to
a
good-faith
effort.
but
let
me
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'll
just
go
back.
well,
no.
there
are
three
parts
to
number
1.
i'm
not
being--
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
the
first
one
is
to
revert
back
to
the
prior
enforcement
regime
that
existed
before
2004,
which
deferred
to
reasonable
judgments,
was
restricted
to
material
that
is
not
momentary
exposure
but
is
dwelled
upon.
and
that
as
pacifica
explained,
was
egregious
material
akin
to
depictions
of
erotic
activity.
the
second
thing
they
could
do
is
make
this
three-factor
test
--
or
however
many
factors
it
is
--
a
test,
not
just
a
nonexclusive
list
of
an
infinite
number
of
factors
that
could
or
couldn't
be
balanced
in
any
way
the
commission
wants
to.
even
if
it
wants
to
leave
it
as
factors
--
and
this
is
number
3
--
it
could
at
least
identify
what
they
are,
and
apply
them
consistency
--
consistently
through
adjudication
that
explains
why
one
over-balances
the
other,
which
it
certainly
did
not
do
in
this
case.
and
it
also
could
clean
up
the
actual
form
of
the
words
that
it
uses,
referring,
for
example,
to
sexually
explicit
or
excretory
activities.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
