justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
i
took
it
from
the
briefs
and
what
the
fcc
has
been
doing
that
the
major
objection
is
that
one
cannot
tell
what's
indecent
and
what
isn't;
that
it's
fcc,
the
censor,
that's
saying
nypd
blue>
["]
is
not.
and
i
do
think
that
that
is
the
major
objection,
that
we
have
a
--
a
government
agency
that
is
going
to
make
decisions
about
when
nudity
is
okay
and
when
it
isn't.
you
can't
do
it
in
terms
of
time
because
the
nypd>
["]
was
7
seconds
and
another
broadcast,
catch-22>
["],
was
40
seconds.
so
it's
--
it's
the
appearance
of
arbitrariness
about
how
the
fcc
is
defining
indecency
in
concrete
situations.
that
i
think
is
the
nature
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
i'm
not
so
sure,
because
the
examples
were
given
of
i
guess
excerpts
from
"private
ryan"
and
from
"schindler's
list",
have
been
on
television.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
did
an
excerpt
from
"hair",
could
they
televise
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
opera
in
the
"metropolis"
case
there's
a
scene
where
a
woman
is
seen
nude
entering
a
bathtub.
suppose
that
were
shown,
that
scene
from
the
opera.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
saying
that
the
standard
can
still
be
symbolic,
as
justice
scalia
said.
we
want
the
king's
english
--
for
the
very
children
we're
talking
about
when
they
go
on
the
street,
when
they
--
their
big
brother
says
something
to
them,
it
is
--
the
words
that
were,
the
expletives,
are
in
common
parlance
today.
i
mean,
it
is
--
i
think
that
children
--
the
children
are
not
going
to
be
shocked
by
them
the
way
they
might
have
been
a
generation
ago.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
justices
involved
said
this
is
a
narrow
decision,
both
justice
stevens
and
justice
powell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
the
other
side,
you'd
better
be
careful
about
calling
certain
people,
certain
artists
to
be
interviewed
because
we
know
it's
unscripted.
they
are
going
to
risk
that
they
are
going
to
say
something
they
shouldn't
say.
