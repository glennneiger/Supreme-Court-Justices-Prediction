chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-1293,
federal
communications
commission
v.
fox
television
stations.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
broadcasts
didn't
commonly
have
this
sort
of
--
these
sorts
of
words
or
these
sorts
of
images.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
know.
we
can
--
it
was
not
the
case
from
1927
until
whenever
you
--
what,
1970-something
--
that
nudity
commonly
appeared
on
broadcast
television
or
the
various
words
we're
dealing
with
here
commonly
appeared.
so
it
seems
a
bit
much
to
say
well,
they
didn't
bring
any
cases
for
that
period.
there
were
no
cases
to
be
brought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
cuts
both
ways.
people
who
want
to
watch
broadcasts
where
these
words
or
expose
their
children
to
broadcasts
where
these
words
are
used,
where
there
is
nudity,
there
are
800
channels
where
they
can
go
for
that.
all
we
are
asking
for,
what
the
government
is
asking
for,
is
a
few
channels
where
you
can
say
i'm
not
going
to
--
they
are
not
going
to
hear
the
s
word,
the
f
word.
they
are
not
going
to
see
nudity.
so
the
proliferation
of
other
media
it
seems
to
me
cuts
against
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
your
argument
there,
is
that
it's
not
a
legitimate
objective
to
have
a
safe
harbor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
depends
what
your
audience--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
depends
on
what
audience
you're
--
you're
trying
to
get,
and
the
demographic.
if
you
are
trying
to
get
an
audience
that
is
older,
maybe
you
will
decide
this
is
what
is
going
to
attract
them.
they
don't
want
sanitized
language.
they
want
to
hear
the
--
the
--
all
those
other
words.
if
your
target
is
a
much
younger
audience,
maybe
that
will
happen.
but
the
idea
that
you're
--
the
problem
is
going
to
go
away
because
you
are
going
to
be
good
as
you
can
be,
that
seems
an
odd
way
to
analyze
first
amendment
problems.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
people
understand
--
what
you
have
demonstrated
i
think
is
that
the
context
matters.
people
understand
that,
including
children.
when
they
hear
a
bad
word
when
someone
hits
their
thumb
with
a
hammer,
they
understand
that's
different
than
having
an
adult
stand
in
normal
conversations
and
use
the
words.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is
saying
that
the
government
cannot
regulate
with
an
understanding
of
what
takes
place
in
the
real
world.
the
government's
effort
is
to
try
to
understand
the
context.
that's
why
you
get
a
different
rule
in
"saving
private
ryan"
than
you
get
with
paris
hilton
and
nicole
richie.
and
what
your
argument
seems
to
be
is
they
can't
take
context
into
account.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
you've
got--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
what
you've
got
over
85
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i'm
going
to
let
you
get
all
four
out.
but
on
that,
the
reasonable
deference
to
the
broadcasters,
your
policy
was
not
to
allow
people
in
the
situation
of
paris
hilton
and
nicole
richie
to
use
those
words.
so
if
they
deferred
to
your
reasonable
judgment,
your
friend's
reasonable
judgment,
they
would
sanction
those.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
go
on
to
number
2.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
time's
--
i
think
you
are.
your
time
is
about
to
expire.
if
you
want
to
get
your
four
points
out,
you'd
better
move.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
verrilli,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence,
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case,
10-1293,
fcc
versus
fox
television.
