justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
--
could
you
digress
for
one
minute
to
help
me
understand
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
when
it
was
here
last
time,
we
were
dealing
with
an
issue
called
fleeting
expletives
and
that
was
fox.
and
the
fox
case
involved
just
that.
they
didn't
really,
or
we
didn't,
or
the
court
didn't,
attack
the
2001
order
which
is
now
at
issue.
and
then
without
it
going
back
to
the
commission,
the
second
circuit
decided
it
on
a
ground
that
sets
aside
the
2001
order.
now,
can
we
here
just
decide
the
fleeting
expletive
case,
because
the
fleeting
expletive
case
has
to
do
with
one
subset
of
applications
of
the
2001
order
and
has
to
do
with
part
2.2
or
something.
i
mean,
it
has
--
and
how
you
interpret
the
words
"material
dwells
on
or
repeats".
now,
that
i
--
i
understand
how
to
get
at.
the
abc
case
raises
--
doesn't
raise
fleeting
expletives.
it
wasn't
fleeting.
and
it
raises
the
question
of
the
validity
of,
under
vagueness
grounds,
of
2001
industry
guidance
and
how
that's
been
applied.
but
the
second
circuit
didn't
deal
with
that
case.
it
sent
it
back
to
the
commission.
so
has
there
been
a
commission
decision
recently
which
has
reviewed
the
basic
arguments
being
made
here
about
the
validity
of
the
2001
industry
guidance
as
applied?
has
there
been
such
a
thing?
alternatively,
has
there
been
an
appeals
court
holding
on
the
analysis
of
the
abc
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
in
that
case,
and
they
sent
the
abc
case
back
--
i
see
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
when
this
abc
case
was
argued
in
front
of
the
commission,
i
have
here
about
30
briefs
at
least,
maybe
40,
and
they
are
filled
with
very
good
arguments.
were
those
arguments
made
to
the
commission
in
the
context
of
the
abc
case?
because
as
it
comes
up
here,
we
are
--
whereas
i
thought
when
we
granted
cert,
quite
honestly,
that
this
was
fox
coming
back,
as
i've
read
the
brief
it
isn't
at
all.
this
is
a
new
case,
nothing
to
do
with
what
we
decided
before.
this
is
the
case
of
abc,
period.
and
it
is
an
attack
on
the
2001
guidelines,
not
fleeting
expletives.
and
therefore,
i
want
to
know,
at
least
satisfy
myself,
that
this
fox
--
this
abc
case
has
gone
through
ordinary
procedures
and
indeed
these
arguments
have
all
been
made
in
front
of
the
commission
and
they
have
been
rejected.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
every
one,
but
has
the
essence
of
these
arguments--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
suppose
we
take
that
particular
line.
you
didn't
argue
--
i
mean,
fox
didn't
argue
--
fox
was
worried
about
the
fleeting
expletive
policy
in
golden
globe.
i
doubt
in
golden
globe,
when
it
was
before
the
commission,
they
raised
all
these
vagueness
challenges
to
the
whole
2001
policy.
so
why
--
here
you
have
taken
a
much
broader
stance,
now,
though
you
didn't
before.
i
mean
do
you
want
to
say
anything
about
what
i
think
is
the
basic
issue
that
fox
raises?
we
don't
have
to
overrule
pacifica.
what
fox
was
penalized
for
was
two
women
on
television
who
basically
used
a
fleeting
expletive
which
seems
to
be
naturally
part
of
their
vocabulary.
[laughter]
and
we're
worried
about
small
stations
that
cannot
censor
people
because
they
don't
know
what
they
are
going
to
say.
all
right,
that
is
what
we
wrote,
i
think
in
my
opinion,
anyway.
we
were
worried
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
abandoning
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
an
a,
b,
c
argument
primarily.
but
you
made
that
argument
in
the
second
circuit.
what
i
am
fishing
with,
you
don't
have
to
comment
more,
but
--
is
do
we
have
to
reach
that
argument?
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
very,
very
broad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
wasn't
--
i
mean,
i
--
don't
know
about
this
instance.
it's
called
"nude
awakening",
it's
about
the
sexual
awakening
of
a
child.
you
ran
it,
your
client,
after
10:00
on
both
coasts
and
they
choose
to
run
it
at
9:00
for
some
unknown
reason
in
the
midwest.
maybe
they
thought
--
i
don't
know,
whatever.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
my
point
is
what
the
fcc
terribly
told
you
to
do
was
run
it
1
hour
later
in
the
midwest,
just
as
you
did
on
the
coast.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
why
is
that
not
--
i'm
not
saying,
taking
this
point
of
view,
but
i'm
saying
why
--
isn't
that
just
time,
manner
and
circumstance
that
puts
you
to
very
little
trouble,
and
allows
everybody
to
see
it,
and
therefore
is
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
wanted
to
make
more
money
from
it,
i
understand
that.
and
maybe
people
would
have
been
a
little
bit
inconvenienced,
but
the
inconvenience
--
they
made
a
judgment
that
looking
at
this
show
is
not
like
"private
ryan",
it's
about
sexual
awakening;
they
are
showing
a
part
of
a
nude
woman,
the
viewer
is
supposed
to
put
himself
in
the
position
of
the
boy
who
is
seeing
her,
and
the
whole
thing
was
titillating.
now
they
might
be
wrong;
there
are
two
sides
to
that
argument;
and
so
i
guess
what
you
are
arguing
is,
if
i
were
to
say
is
that
a
reasonable
view
--
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
it.
but
you
have
to
say
much
--
you
are
telling
me
i
have
to
say
much
more
than
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
going
off
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
--
you
haven't
seen
where
i'm
going.
i
wanted
you
to
say
just
exactly
what
you
said,
and
you
did,
which
i
thank
you--
[laughter]
and
--
and
my
question,
which
i
have
been
trying
to
get
so
you
would
see
very
precisely
what
it
is,
is
why
don't
i
just
say,
if
you
are
right,
just
what
you
said?
and
say
this
is
an
instance,
case-by-case,
in
which,
for
the
reasons
and
i
quote
you,
that
the
first
amendment
forbids
the
application
of
a
good
guideline
to
this
case.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
driving
at
is
the
basic
thing
that's
worrying
me
here:
does
this
case
in
front
of
us
really
call
for
the
earthshaking
decision
that
you
all
have
argued
for
in
the
--
in
the
briefs?
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
and
that's
why
i
am
particularly
worried
about
whether
or
not
this
whole
big
argument
here
was
presented
to
the
fcc
about
whether
we
have
to
reach
that
far.
now
do
you
see
where
i
was
trying
to
get?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--looked
and
found
17.
i
looked
and
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
your
only
conclusion
from
that
is
that
they
can't
have
any
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
--
i
looked
through
the
briefs;
i
don't
see
what
you're
--
tell
me
where
in
these
briefs
do
you
suggest
what
the
rule
ought
to
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
they
in
the
briefs?
can
you
just
cite
the
pages
where
i
will
find
the
alternatives
to
the
present
system
that
don't
jump
obscenity
alone.
