justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
will
happen
when
--
when
we
get
to
the
point
where
--
when
there
are
only
a
handful
of
people
in
the
entire
country
who
are
still
receiving
television
programs
via
the
airwaves?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
want
us
to
overrule
a
decision
of
this
court,
pacifica?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
as
to
radio,
what
has
changed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--to
justify
that?
well,
could
we
hold
that
the
policy
is
invalid
as
to
--
on
first
amendment
grounds
as
to
tv
but
not
as
to
radio?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
we
rule
in
your
favor
on
first
amendment
grounds,
what
will
--
people
who
watch
fox
be
seeing
between
6:00
a.m.
and
10:00
p.m.?
are
they
going
to
be
seeing
a
lot
of
people
parading
around
in
the
nude
and
a
stream
of
expletives?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
will
you
put
on
that
you
are
not
able
to
put
on
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
broadcast
tv
is
living
on
borrowed
time.
it
is
not
going
to
be
long
before
it
goes
the
way
of
vinyl
records
and
8
track
tapes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure--
[laughter]
i'm
sure
your
clients
will
continue
to
make
billions
of
dollars
on
their
programs
which
are
transmitted
by
cable
and
by
satellite
and
by
internet.
but
to
the
extent
they
are
making
money
from
people
who
are
using
rabbit
ears,
that
is
disappearing.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yeah.
so
why
not
let
this
die
a
natural
death?
or
why
do
you
want
us
to
intervene--
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
are
asking
us
to
intervene
by
overruling
a
prior
precedent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
that
inherent
in
a
context-based
approach?
unless
you
have
an
approach
that
says
there
are
certain
body
parts
you
can
never
show,
then
aren't
you
going
to
get
into
--
isn't
someone
going
to
be
able
to
come
up
and
say
you
have
this
broadcast
and
you
said
that's
okay,
and
this
one,
you
said
is
not
okay?
