mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
its
previous
decision
in
this
case,
the
court
observed
that
when
a
broadcast
licensee
takes
a
license
for
the
free
and
exclusive
use
of
a
valuable
part
of
the
public
domain,
it
also
accepts
enforceable
public
obligations.
one
of
those
enforceable
obligations
is
the
indecency
restriction
which
congress
has
instructed
the
federal
communications
commission
to
enforce
between
the
hours
of
6:00
a.m.
and
10:00
p.m.--
respondents
in
this
case
have
for
years
benefited
enormously
from
their
free
and
exclusive
use
of
public
spectrum.
they
argue,
however,
that
neither
congress
nor
the
commission
may
as
a
condition
of
their
licenses
require
that
they
refrain
from
broadcasting
indecent
material
when
children
are
most
likely
to
be
in
the
audience.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
this
condition
is
appropriate,
justice
kagan,
because
it
has
been
a
defining
feature
of
the
broadcast
medium
from
its
inception
in
the
1920s
in
the
radio
act
and
has
continued
to
be
a
defining
feature
of
this
medium
throughout
its
history.
and
the
argument
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
making
here
is
that
that
norm,
that
legally
enforceable
norm
which
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
pacifica
and
has
been
applied
since
the
inception
of
this
medium,
needs
to
be
overturned
now
because
circumstances
have
changed.
and
i
would
point
out
first,
if
i
may--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
that's
true.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
certainly
true,
justice
scalia,
and
i
will
certainly
get
to
vagueness,
if
i
--
if
i
may
continue
along
this
line.
their
argument
is
that
circumstances
have
fundamentally
changed.
i
want
to
point
out
at
the
outset
something
i
think
is
significant,
which
is
that
their
argument
would
sweep
away
indecency
restriction
with
respect
to
radio
as
well
as
television,
and
they
would
sweep
that
away
in
the
arguments
they
are
making
today
without
making
any
showing
that
circumstances
have
changed
at
all
with
respect
to
the
ubiquity
of
--
or
accessibility
of
radio.
and
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
fcc
orders
that
this
court
cited
in
its
prior
decision
in
this
case,
one
would
see
that
a
lot
of
the
most
vile
and
lewd
material
really
is
in
radio.
so
i
just
want
to
put
that
marker
down
at
the
beginning
here
because
i
do
think
it
is
quite
important.
no
showing
has
been
made
about
radio.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
pacifica
itself,
justice
kennedy,
was
a
case
about
a
radio
broadcast.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
the
respondents
are
arguing
in
this
case
that
pacifica
ought
to
be
overruled
because
the
circumstances
that
justified
its
rule
no
longer
obtain.
i
want
to
put
a
marker
in
at
the
outset
here
with
respect
to
radio
because
i
do
think
it's
quite
important,
that
they
haven't
made
any
argument
that
those
circumstances
are
any
different
with
respect
to
radio.
it's
just
as
ubiquitous
as
it
was.
there
isn't
even
any
argument
that
there
is
blocking
technology
available.
i
want
to
make
sure,
given
the
kind
of
vile
material
that
the
record
demonstrates
has
been
transmitted
over
time
on
radio,
that
the
court
focuses
on
the
breadth
of
the
argument
that
the
respondents
are
making
here.
now,
with
respect
to
television,
i
do
think
they
are
making
an
argument
that
--
that
television
broadcasting
is
no
longer
uniquely
pervasive
in
the
way
that
it
was
before.
they
are
not
making
an
argument
--
but
that,
if
i
may,
is
a
very
different
kind
of
argument
than
one
would
normally
get
in
support
of
a
--
the
suggestion
that
we
ought
to
depart
from
stare
decisis.
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
arguing
that
broadcast
television
is
any
less
pervasive
than
it
was.
if
anything,
it
is
probably
more
pervasive
now.
they
are
not
arguing
that
the
harms
of
that
pervasiveness
no
longer
exist.
what
they
are
arguing
is
that
there
is
other
media
that
present
harms
as
well,
and
that
with
respect
--
and
that
because
those
other
media
also
present
harms,
the
circumstances
require
a
change
in
the
rule
with
respect
to
broadcasters.
now
that
--
you
can
i
think
look
at
that
in
one
of
two
ways.
you
could
say
either
that's
an
argument
that
it's
futile
to
continue
to
impose
this
restriction
on
broadcasters,
and
i
think
that's
what
fox
says
at
page
33
of
its
brief.
two
points
in
response
to
that.
i
think
a
significant
if
not
complete
answer
was
in
this
court's
prior
decision
in
this
case
in
which
it
said
that
the
maintenance
of
a
safe
haven
is
actually
particularly
important
in
--
in
the
context
of
these
changes,
a
broadcast
safe
haven.
and
also
i
do
think
that
the
idea
of
futility
in
that
nature
is
foreign
to
our
first
amendment
jurisprudence.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
let
me
turn
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
--
two
points
about
that.
the
first
one
is
that
as
we
read
this
court's
recent
decision
in
humanitarian
law
project,
the
question
on
the
fifth
amendment
analysis
of
whether
there
is
vagueness
and
arbitrary
enforcement
has
to
be
answered
by
reference
to
the
specific
broadcasts
at
issue
here.
in
other
words,
was
there
fair
notice
with
respect
to
these
specific
broadcasts?
and
i
will
get
to
that,
but
i
--
but
let
me
first
go
directly
to
your
honor's
more
significant
question.
and
i
think
the
--
the
problem
with
looking
at
the
case
that
way
is
that
the
lens
is
focused
too
narrowly,
in
that
there
actually,
when
one
broadens
out
the
lens
and
looks
at
the
wide
range
of
decisions
that
the
commission
is
making
about
indecency
and
then
broadens
it
out
even
further
and
looks
at
the
wide
range
of
broadcasts
that
occur,
actually
the
number
of
broadcasts
are
--
that
have
been
identified
as
even
raising
a
question
of
arbitrariness
or
inconsistency
is
a
--
is
really
quite
a
miniscule
fraction.
it's
even
quite
a
miniscule
fraction
even
with
respect
to
broadcasts
that
the
commission
has
adjudicated
as
indecent
or
not
indecent.
and
yes,
we
would
concede
that
there
is
not
perfect
clarity
in
this
rule.
it's
a
context-based
rule.
as
we
read
pacifica,
the
court
suggested
in
pacifica
that
the
context-based
rule
may
well
be
what
the
constitution
requires
here,
and
that's
going
to
result
in
some
--
something
less
than
absolute
precision.
but
the
--
of
course,
the
alternative,
i
would
assume
from
my
friend's
perspective,
would
be
worse.
the
commission
could
have
a
list
that
said:
never
say
the
following
however
many
words,
never
show
broadcasting
between
the
hours
of
6:00
a.m.
--
nudity
between
the
hours
of
6:00
a.m.
and
10:00
p.m.--
that
would
be
clearer,
but
it
would
--
but
in
a
way
the
commission
here,
i
think
by
following
the
context-based
approach
that
i
think
pacifica
suggested
was
required,
is
being
--
"punished"
is
too
strong
a
word,
but
it's
being
held
against
it
that
it's
trying
to
make
reasonable
accommodations
for
first
amendment
values.
and
so
i
think
when
one
looks
at
it
both
in
terms
of
where
the
lenses
actually
ought
to
be
focused
here
and
the
fact
that
the
--
the
alternative
perfect
clarity
would
reach
a
less
effective
accommodation
of
first
amendment
values,
then
i
do
think
that
the
commission's
position
is
quite
reasonable
and
sensible.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
do
--
i
agree
with
you,
justice
breyer,
a,
that
this
is
a
complex
procedural
posture;
b,
that
the
court
would
have
some
discretion
in
how
it
approached
and
resolved
the
case.
with
respect
to
the
abc
case,
as
i
read
the
commission's
orders,
which
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
it
applied
the
2001
industry
guidance
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
abc
broadcast
was
indecent.
and
then
that
was
--
that
--
then
abc
appealed
that
to
the
second
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
and
that
the
second
circuit
then
found
that
the
commission
had
violated
the
constitution
in
reaching
that
result.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
they
did
on
--
when
it
came
back,
your
honor,
they
then,
they
disposed
of
the
fox
case
with
a
lengthy
opinion
and
then
essentially
applied
that
analysis
to
the
abc
case.
so
i
think
in
fairness--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so,
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
vouch
for
the
proposition
that
the
arguments
have
all
been
made
in
front
of
the
commission.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
in
fairness,
i
do
think
that
if
one
reads
the
commission's
disposition
of
the
abc
case,
it
is
applying
the
2001
guidance
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
broadcast
was
indecent
under
the
2001
guidance.
abc
paid
the
fine
that
it
was
assessed,
and
then,
as
it
has
--
as
it
can
do,
then
invoked
the
hobbs
act
and
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
challenge
it.
and
so
i
do
think
--
i
do
actually
think
that
the
issues
have
been
considered
by
the
agency
and
are
before
the
court.
and
i
do
agree
with
your
honor,
moving
i
think
more
directly
to
the
vagueness
point,
that
there
really
isn't
a
vagueness
issue
left
with
respect
to
the
fleeting
expletives
in
the
fox
case,
because
the
court
said
the
last
time
the
case
was
here
that
there
is
no
problem
of
arbitrary
punishment
because
there
was
no
forfeiture
or
any
other
sanction.
abc
is
in
a
different
position
because
they
were
sanctioned.
and
so
there
is
an
issue
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
the
commission's
indecency
standards
can
constitutionally
be
applied
here
and
whether
they
are
too
vague.
but
i
do
think,
and
i
would
like
to
spend
a
minute
on
that
question
of
whether
there
is
vagueness
as
applied
to
the
abc
broadcast.
now,
the
commission's
standards
in
the
2001
guidance
say
that
this
is
essentially
a
two-part
test.
first
is
a
subject
matter
question:
is
there
a
description
or
depiction
of
sexual
or
excretory
activities
or
organs?
and
then
there
is
the
question
of
whether
the
depiction
or
description
is
patently
offensive
under
community
standards
for
broadcast
informed
by
three
factors:
whether
the
expression
is
explicit;
whether
the
broadcast
dwells
on
it;
and
whether
it's
shocking
or
pandering
or
titillating.
now,
abc
makes
an
argument
with
respect
to
this
broadcast
that
the
nudity
in
the
nypd
blue>
["]
episode
is
outside
of
the
first
subject
matter
criteria
because
it
didn't
have
fair
notice
that
buttocks
would
be
considered
sexual
organs
for
purposes
of
application
of
this
--
of
this
standard.
the
commission
said,
and
this
is
at
page
137a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
that
it's
impossible
to
believe
that
they
didn't
think
that
the
naked
display
of
buttocks
would
bring
them
within
--
that
they
didn't
have
fair
notice
that
the
naked
display
of
buttocks
would
bring
them
within
this
rule.
i'm
not
sure
anything
more
needs
to
be
said
about
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--with
respect,
justice
kagan,
i
really
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
the
situation.
moving
to
the
second
part
of
the
analysis
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
take
a
half
a
step
back.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
i
think
everybody,
all
of
us,
understands
in
our
experience,
that
nudity
on
broadcast
television
is
an
exceedingly,
exceedingly
rare
thing
at
any
time
of
the
day,
and
certainly
between
6:00
a.m.
and
10
p.m.
it
is
exceedingly
rare,
and
all
of
us
from
our
experience
know
that.
and
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
but
again
i
think
that's
another
issue
about
where
the
lens
is
focused.
there
have
been
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
broadcasts,
and
the
respondents
have
identified
four
in
which
--
over
25
years,
in
which
any
nudity
has
been
present.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
certainty
true,
justice
scalia.
and
i
do
think
in
reno
this
court
described
the
carlin
monologue
at
issue
in
pacifica
in
the
following
way.
it
said
that
monologue
was
readily
identifiable
as
indecent
because
it
was
a
dramatic
departure
from
the
customary
norms
for
the
broadcast
medium.
i
think
the
kind
of
nudity
--
and
i
think
if
one
just
looks
at
the
video
here
and
sees
it,
i
think
it's
hard
to
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
that
is
a
dramatic
departure
from
what's
the
norm
for
broadcast
television.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it
would
raise
serious
questions.
i
think
nudity
is
going
to
raise
very
serious
questions,
and
i
think
--
9--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
--
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
in
a
context-based
approach,
there's
not
going
to
be
perfect
clarity.
we
recognize
that.
but
i
do
think
with
respect
to
this
broadcast,
and
that's
the
question
before
the
court,
whether
fox
--
excuse
me,
whether
abc
was
on
fair
notice
of
whether
this
broadcast
would
bring
them
within
the
rule.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
two
points
in
response
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
first,
i
think
the
court's
previous
decision
in
this
case
goes
a
long
way
to
providing
an
answer,
that
yes,
it
does
make
a
difference
to
preserve
a
safe
haven
where
if
parents
want
to
put
their
kids
down
in
front
of
the
television
at
8:00
p.m.,
they
know
that
there's
a
segment
of
what's
available
that
--
where
they're
not
going
to
have
to
worry
about
whether
the
kids
are
going
to
get
bombarded
with
curse
words
or
nudity.
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
of
course,
you
ask
your
15-year-old,
or
your
10-year-old,
how
to
turn
off
of
the
chip.
they're
the
only
ones
that
know
how
to
do
it.
[laughter]
that
does
point
out
the
problem
with
the
v-chip,
of
course,
the
v-chip
is
not
new.
it's
been
around
for
more
than
a
decade,
and
the
--
the
broadcasters
have
tried
to
encourage
uptake.
the
government
has
tried
to
encourage
uptake.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
a
different
point.
i
think
that
--
i
want
to
get
to
what
i
think
is
the
fundamental
point
here,
that
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
respect
to
the
ability
of
a
viewer
to
differentiate
whether
something
is
a
broadcast
channel
or
a
cable
channel,
the
reality
is
that
broadcasters
are
in
a
different
position
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
have
a
license
from
the
government
that
comes
with
this
enforceable
public
obligation
that
allows
the
government
to
create
this
safe
haven,
and
that
puts
them
in
a
different
position.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
is
there
--
well,
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
the
v-chip
works
with
both
broadcast
and
cable
transmissions,
to
the
extent
it
works.
the
--
what
the
briefs
have
pointed
out
--
and
i
would
suggest
in
particular
that
the
court
look
at
the
brief
from
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics,
which
does
a
very
thorough
job
in
explaining
the
many
ways
in
which
the
v-chip
has
proven
to
be
a
deficient
technology.
a
lot
of
it
goes
to
the
inaccuracy
and
incompleteness
of
the
codes,
the
labels
that
the
programmers
put
in
to
begin
with,
which
have
to
be
there
in
order
for
the
v-chip
to
decide
what
gets
through
and
what
doesn't.
and
i
would
point
out
in
this
very
case,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
--
for
example,
the
2003
billboard
music
awards
broadcast
with
the
paris
hilton-nicole
richie
back
and
forth,
one
would
never
have
known
from
the
code
affixed
for
the
v-chip
purpose
that
that
broadcast
was
going
to
have
those
kinds
of
words
in
them.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
we're
not
there
now,
as
we've
said
in
our
brief.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
that
--
but
i
think
that
really
makes
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
points
here,
is
that
the
broadcasters
want
to
have
it
both
ways,
right?
they
--
the
spectrum
licenses
they
have
are
worth
billions
and
billions
of
dollars.
spectrum
is
staggeringly,
staggeringly
scarce,
and
--
and
they're
sitting
on
an
enormously
valuable
resource
which
they
got
for
free,
and
then
they
have
a
statutory
benefit
of
must-carry,
which
gets
them
on
cable
systems
automatically,
and
a
further
statutory
benefit
of
preferred
channel
placement
on
--
on
those--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
we
certainly
agree,
justice
scalia,
with
the
point
that
was
made
in
the
court's
previous
decision
in
this
case,
that
--
for
example,
the
words
that
are
in
the
fox
broadcast,
teachers
don't
use
those
words
with
students.
you
don't
hear
those
words
in
churches
or
synagogues.
you
--
there
are
many,
many
contexts--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
i
think
if
i
may--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
something
this
court
said
in
its
prior
decision
is
right
on
the
mark
with
respect
to
this
issue,
which
is
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
portrayed
as
appropriate.
and
when
it
is
--
it's
one
thing
when
your
13-year-old
brother
is
saying
it
to
you
or
some
bully
in
the
schoolyard's
saying
it
to
you.
it's
another
when
it's
presented
to
you
in
this
medium
as
an
appropriate
means
of
communication.
that's
true
with
respect
to
words,
and
it's
also
true
with
respect
to
nudity.
if
i
might
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
with
respect
to
the
notion
of
self
restraint
on
the
part
of
broadcasters,
i
think
a
little
history
is
in
order
here.
the
commission
started
with
the
rule
that
came
out
of
pacifica.
what
it
faced
in
the
1980's,
with
that
being
the
outer
bound
of
the
commission's
authority,
was
the
explosion
of
the
shock
jock
phenomenon,
howard
stern
and
bubba
the
love
sponge
and
the
rest
of
it
which
didn't
use
any
of
the
seven
words
in
the
carlin
monologue,
but
which
was
highly
vile
and
lewd,
and
it
required
the
commission
to
make
a
judgment.
now,
that
was
all
advertising
sponsored
broadcast.
and
so
i
do
think
the
risk
of
the
race
to
the
bottom
is
real,
and
i
think
history
is
showing
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
--
well,
i
disagree.
first,
that's
the
lens
problem
again.
we
are
talking
about
a
tiny,
tiny
number
of
the
broadcasts
that
occur
in
a
month,
much
less
a
year,
much
less
a
decade.
so
the
idea
that
there's
a
significant
first
amendment
problem
that
encompasses
a
wide
variety
of
broadcast
expression,
i
just
don't
think
comports
with
the
facts.
second,
i
do
think
if
one
looks
at
the
corpus
of
decisions
that
the
commission
has
made
about
what
is
indecent
and
what
isn't,
i
think
one
can
see
with
respect
to
the
large
majority
of
them,
the
vast
majority
of
them
that
it
is
clear
which
side
of
the
line
something
fell
on.
yes,
there
is
isn't
perfect
clarity,
there
are
going
to
be
some
hard
cases,
but
they
really
have
identified
where
is,
in
the
great
scheme
of
things,
a
trivial
number
of
hard
cases.
i
don't
think
one
can
say
that
this
is
a
situation
like
in
reno
which
there
is
effectively
no
standard
at
all.
in
reno,
this
court
distinguished
the
pacifica
situation
eight
ways
to
sunday,
and
i
think
we've
identified
them
in
our
brief
and
those
are
valid.
i
do
think
there
is
a
significant
problem
with
thinking
about
pacifica
as
the
outer
bound
of
the
commission's
authority
under
the
first
amendment
in
addition
to
the
shock
jock
problem.
of
course--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
and,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
true
and
the
principles
the
commission
continues
to
apply
are
narrow
principles.
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
something
that
covers
a
vast
array
of
speech
on
broadcast.
it's
a
tiny
fraction.
and
so
--
and
i
do
think
if
you
are
talking
about
pacifica
as
the
outer
bound,
the
consequences
of
the
shock
jocks
are
fine;
the
super
bowl
half
time
episode
with
janet
jackson
is
fine.
you
can
have
as
many
of
these
seven
second
episodes
of
nypd
blue>
["]
as
you
want.
that's
all
fine.
in
fact,
anything
that
isn't
at
that
extreme
level
--
24--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
i
--
a
couple
answers
there.
one
is
the
delaying
bleeping
technology,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
other
one
is
that
there
is
a
scienter
requirement
under
the
commission's
enforcement
authority
here.
and
so
in
that
situation,
it
seems
highly
unlikely
you
had
would
have
the
requisite
scienter
that
could
lead
to
a
forfeiture.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
let
me
spend,
if
i
could,
a
minute
on
the
nypd
blue>
["]
broadcast.
the
--
abc
hinges
a
lot
on
the
notion,
justice
breyer,
that
this
is
a
non-sexualized
episode.
i
mean,
i
guess
one
could
make
up
ones
own
mind
looking
at
the
video.
the
commission
decided
that
that
was
--
it
was
essentially
voyeurism.
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--thank
you.
the
little
boy
walks
into
the
room
at
the
very
end
of
that
--
of
that
segment
of
nudity,
and
i
do
think
that
fully
vindicates
the
commission's
judgment
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
that
broadcast.
