mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
respond
initially
to
some
of
general
verrilli's
general
observations.
first
of
all,
he
talks
about
indecency
as
somehow
serving
as
the
core
of
the
overall
understanding
of
the
regulatory
deal
that
was
made
here.
and
it's
difficult
for
me
to
accept
that
notion
when
there
was
no
effort
whatsoever
to
enforce
the
standard
of
indecency
between
1927
and
1975.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
maybe,
maybe
not.
we
don't
know.
all
we
know
is
that
for
a
period
of
50
years,
nothing
happened,
so
the
idea--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
only
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
chief
justice,
is
that
if
you're
talking
about
this
as
sort
of
the
core
understanding
between
the
parties,
it
simply
played
a
fairly
minor
role
in
the
process
through
the
bulk
of
the
regulatory
period
we're
talking
about.
and
indeed,
if
you
put
it
in
context,
this
is
a
statute
that
prohibits
obscenity,
profanity
and
indecency.
and
while
the
fcc
spent
a
lot
of
time
writing
about
profanity
as
somehow
being
offended
by
what
went
on
in
this
omnibus
order,
the
commission
has
completely
abandoned
that
under
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
kagan,
it
was
important
to
catch
the
answer
to
your
question
when
you
asked
it
of
general
verrilli,
which
was,
you're
not
saying
that
we
lose
all
of
our
first
amendment
rights.
so
clearly
we
retain
our
first
amendment
rights.
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
just
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
idea
that
it,
quote,
2001,
even
i
would
say
until
2004,
when
the
commission
wildly
changed
its
approach.
and
it's
only
become
dysfunctional
since
2004.
and
as
we
sit
here
today,
literally
facing
thousands
and
thousands
of
ginned-up
computer-generated
complaints
that
are
holding
up
literally
hundreds
of
tv
license
renewals,
so
that
the
whole
system
has
come
to
a
screeching
halt
because
of
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
resolve
these
issues.
so
to
say
that
the
system
is
working
well
seems
to
me,
at
least
from
the
broadcasters'
perspective,
is
to
suggest
that's
just
not
true.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
here--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely,
your
honor,
because
there
are
fundamentally
different
media
and
there
are
different
protections
and
the
circumstances
are
different
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
media
have
to
be
evaluated
individually.
but
what
has
happened
over
the
30
years
with
respect
to
the
broadcast
side
of
television
is
a
very
fundamental
change.
cable
is
now
equally
pervasive.
cable
is
now
equally
accessible
to
tv,
satellite
equally
accessible
to
tv.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all
the
notion
that
one
medium
operates
in
a
certain
way
in
the
exercise
of
its
first
amendment
rights
can
be
used
as
an
explanation
for
taking
away
or
for
restricting
the
first
amendment
rights
of
another
medium
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
said
across
the
board
in
the
first
amendment
context.
you
don't
balance
off
one
speaker
against
another
and
give
one
favored
status
and
give
another
unfavored
status.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
can
get
a
safe
harbor,
and
indeed
there
are
a
number
of
safe
harbors
that
are
out
there.
first
of
all,
there
are
a
ton
of
cable
networks
that
are
aimed
exclusively
at
children.
there
are
five,
six,
eight
stations
that
i
guarantee
you
where
you
will
see
none
of
that
language.
and
second
of
all,
it's
always
available
to
the
united
states
government
to
decide
to
hold
this
--
to
create
its
own
license
for
the
united
states
to
be
a
broadcaster
and
to
ensure
that
the
broadcasts
of
the
united
states
public
network
exclude
anything
they
want
to
exclude,
because
that's
government
speech,
and
it
is
in
no
way
restricted
by
what
the
first
amendment
would
provide.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
under
the
guidelines
that
fox
has
used
consistently
from
10:00
p.m.
until
6:00
a.m.
and
candidly
that
all
of
the
other
networks
follow.
the
truth
is
the
advertisers
and
the
audiences
that
have
to
be
responded
to
by
the
networks
insist
on
some
measure
of
restraint,
not
a
measure
of
restraint--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
some
of
the
things
that
we
could
at
least
wonder
about
is
catch-22>
["],
perhaps
the
beginning
of
the
olympics.
there
is
a
whole
slew
of
questions,
i
mean.
and
if
you
go
beyond
that
and
you
think
about
what
speech
has
been
chilled,
the
tillman
memorial
service
is
not
broadcast
because
of
fear
of
what's
going
to
be
said
there.
football
games,
basketball
games,
local
news
events--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no,
no,
of
course
not.
but
you
have
to
realize,
justice
breyer,
i
mean
the
second
circuit,
because
it
didn't
have
available
to
it
sort
of
what
to
do
precisely
with
pacifica,
tended
to
focus
on
the
question
of
vagueness.
vagueness
was
certainly
an
argument
that
we
made
there,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
it's
absolutely
clear
to
me
that
if
this
court
wants
to
say
we
decided
the
outer
limits
of
the
1st
amendment
in
pacifica
and
it
goes
to
the
verbal
shock
treatment
that
justice
powell
described
in
a
separate
opinion,
and
this
doesn't
come
anywhere
near
that,
and
therefore
this
is
beyond
what
the
1st
amendment
provides,
the
court
can
clearly
hold
that
way
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
our
basic
argument
would
then
--
i
mean,
obviously
what
--
you
would
be
taking
away
the
vagueness
argument,
but
that
would
just
bring
you
back
then,
justice
scalia,
to
the
core
pacifica
argument
and
the
question
of
how
far
can
the
--
how
is
it
permissible
to
allow
the
fcc
to
regulate
the
broadcast
networks
on
standards
that
are
fundamentally
different
than
cable,
the
internet
and
every
other
medium
that
exists?
i
would
be
perfectly
happy
if
they
want
to
try
to
adopt
those
kinds
of
standards
and
subject
them
to
the
strict
scrutiny
requirements
that
this
court
applies
to
every
other
medium
because
the
truth
is
those
requirements
will
not
withstand
scrutiny
under
those
particular
standards.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
hope
that
--
i'm
sure
my
client
is
not
thrilled
to
have
you
say
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
--
it
would
be
--
you
know,
obviously
not,
because
that's
why
we
are
not
uniquely
accessible
or
uniquely
pervasive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
--
well,
we
didn't
ask
you
to
intervene,
actually
the
fcc
is
going
to
ask
you
to
intervene--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
believe
--
well,
i
think
once
the
issue
is
before
the
court
it
ought
to
decide
the
1st
amendment
question
that's
presented
here.
and
the
1st
amendment
question
says
what
can
the
fcc
do
under
these
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
probably
4
different
ways
you
can
go
about
it,
all
of
which
says
what
the
fcc
did
here
is
wrong.
you
can
say
pacifica
is
an
exceedingly
narrow
decision
and
it
goes
to
the
outer
limits
of
what
the
1st
amendment
allows
the
fcc
to
do.
what
they
have
done
here
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
they
will
use
it,
perhaps.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
wouldn't
continue
to
try
to
bleep
it
out
as
best
we
could.
because
we
have
our
own--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
was
clearly
not
--
i
mean
from
fox's
perspective
it
was
not
scripted
to
set
it
up
that
way.
but,
remember,
the
first
--
the
first
expletive--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
is
inevitable
that
--
well,
i
think
it's
inevitable
regardless
that
people
are
going
to
continue
to
use
language
that
they
would
naturally
use.
so
yes,
i
do
think
you
can
expect
on
cable
and
any
other
forum
in
which
you
have
humans
speaking
that
this
kind
of
language
will
expand.
i
don't
know
that
it
--
and
it
will
probably
be
the
case
that
in
some
context,
particularly
live
television,
which
is
really
what
is
placed
in
jeopardy
by
this,
that
you
will
have
less
live
television
because
your
concern
is
people
will
continue
to
use
this
language.
on
a
lot
of
awards
shows
i
think
it's
candidly
easier
to
go
ahead
and
bleep
this.
it's
not
always
--
it's
not
foolproof,
but
the
stations
are
committed
to
doing
that.
they
have
all
got
their
standards
and
that
was
applied
in
this
particular
case.
so
while
there
may
be
some
marginal
increase
in
it,
if
you
compare
it
to
the
use
of
this
language
beyond
the
broadcast
context,
it
is
just
the
narrowest
of
slivers
of
entry--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--can
the
average
child
understand
of
the
difference
between
the
two--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
in
some
show
--
i
think
it
probably
depends
on
which
--
which
channels
you
--
you
look
at,
and
even
in
the
basic
channels.
but
the
--
there
is
a
cartoon
that
is
significantly
more
adult
that
is
on
the
cable
channels
than
the
cartoons
that
you
might
see
on
the
--
on
the
fox
television.
so
yes,
i
think
there
is
probably
a
certain
edgierness
to
it,
but
that
said,
it's
still
clear
that
--
that
as
long
as
you
have
advertising
revenue
that
--
that
drives
a
significant
amount
of
the
decisionmaking
here,
you
are
going
to
have
the
kind
of
self-restraint
that
frankly
ought
to
cause
the
court
to
say
we
should
no
--
we
no
longer
need
to
treat
the
broadcast
medium
as
the
weak
sister
of
--
of
the
media.
and
therefore
they
ought
to
have
the
same
protections
that
everybody
else
has,
and
that
they
will
engage
in
the
same
restrained
approach
to
these
kinds
of
issues
that
newspapers
do
--
i
mean,
the
post
doesn't
run
the
language
of
the
case
that's
--
that's
being
argued
before
it
--
that
cable
does,
all
of
those
media
do;
because
there
are
natural
restraints.
you
don't
need
the
federal
communications
commission
any
longer
to
ensure
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
--
there
is
some
kind
of
wildly
different
approach.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
--
that
in
general
most
people
who
--
who
rely
upon
advertising
and
have
to
play
to
a
particular
audience
in
order
to
make
their
money,
it's
going
to
--
it's
going
to
obviously
be
restrained.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
at
a
minimum
broadcasting
will
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no,
i
think
it
ought
to
go
--
it
ought
to
be
analyzed
the
exact
opposite,
which
is
that
--
that
the
--
the
obligation,
the
burden
rests
on
the
federal
communications
commission
and
congress
to
show
that
there
is
a
real
problem
that
needs
to
be
solved
and
that
this
is
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
that.
thank
you.
