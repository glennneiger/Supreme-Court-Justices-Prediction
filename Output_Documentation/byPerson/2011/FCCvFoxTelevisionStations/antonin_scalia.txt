justice
antonin
scalia
that's
one
of
their
arguments.
i
mean,
another
one
is
that
you
haven't
defined
it
precisely
enough,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
separate,
really
a
separate
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
their
own
guidelines
that
generally
prohibit
it,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
sign
--
sign
me
up
as
supporting
justice
kennedy's
notion
that
this
has
a
symbolic
value,
just
as
we
require
a
certain
modicum
of
dress
for
the
people
that
attend
this
court
and
the
people
that
attend
other
federal
courts.
it's
a
symbolic
matter.
and
if
this
is
--
these
are
public
airwaves,
the
government
is
entitled
to
insist
upon
a
certain
modicum
of
decency.
i'm
not
sure
it
even
has
to
relate
to
juveniles,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
do
more
and
more.
you
do
more
and
more,
since
there's--
[laughter]
--since
there's
so
much
of
it
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
really
clear.
i
mean,
if
you
want
us
to
be
really
clear
you
should
ask
the
fcc
to
simply
outlaw
any
fleeting
use
of
the
f
word
or
the
s
word,
any
shots
of
any
nudity
in
any
movie,
buttocks
included;
that
would
give
you
all
of
the
notice
that
you
need.
why
don't
you
propose
that?
boy,
that's
certain
as
can
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
acknowledge
to
be
the
vulgarity
of
cable
suggests
otherwise,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
displays
--
how
many
displays
of
nudity
were
there
that
--
that
went
unsanctioned?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
if
there
are
very
few,
it's
--
it's
not
a
very
powerful
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
me
neither.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
third
is
you
shouldn't
interview
these
people.
