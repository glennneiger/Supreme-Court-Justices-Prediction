justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
quite
understand
that.
today
there's
a
--
there
is
either
a
potential
or
a
fact
of
violent
and
objectionable
broadcasting
in
radio?
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
understand
that.
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
you're
saying
is,
is
that
there
is
a
public
value
in
having
a
particular
segment
of
the
media
with
different
standards
than
other
segments.
and
forget
radio.
let's
just
talk
about
television.
but
--
you
know,
in
the
briefs,
it
says
how
much
--
how
many
cable
stations
there
are,
and
you,
what
do
you
call
it,
you
surf
the
--
you
go
through
all
the
channels.
and
it's
not
apparent
to
many
people
which
are
broadcast
and
which
are
not.
but
you're
saying
that
there's
still
a
value,
an
importance,
in
having
a
higher
standard
or
different
standard
for
broadcast
media
on
the
television.
why
is
that,
when
there
are
so
many
other
options,
and
--
and
when
it's
not
apparent
to
many
viewers
which
of
the
two
they're
watching?
just
because
it's
an
important
symbol
for
our
society
that
we
aspire
to
a
culture
that's
not
vulgar
in
--
in
a
very
small
segment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
then
there's
--
and
then
there's
the
chip
that's
available.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
is
your
point
is
that
the
chip
technology
works
better
if
you
have
this
differentiation
between
broadcast
and
cable
media?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
a
way,
that's
circular.
that's
what
we're
here
to
argue
about.
i'm
asking,
is
there
a
functional,
pragmatic,
practical
difference
between
the
two?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
the
inevitable
consequence
or
this
precise
consequence
that
you're
arguing
for
on
this
fleeting
expletive
portion
of
this
case,
that
every
celebrity
or
want
to
be
celebrity
that
is
interviewed
can
feel
free
to
use
one
of
these
words.
we
will
just
expect
it
as
a
matter
of
course,
if
you
prevail.
isn't
that
the
necessary
consequence
of
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean
even
you
did
in
tis
one,
you
said
now
remember
you're
on
television,
which
was
just
--
giving
an
added
incentive
for
these
vulgar
comments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
i
mean,
isn't
it
inevitable
that
this
will
happen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
--
by
sanctioned,
you
mean
punished
as
rather
--
as
opposed
to
sanctions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
--
well,
we
have
to
anticipate
what
the
natural
results
or
consequences
of
our
decision
will
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
understand
it,
the
same
rules
that
we
apply
to
obscenity
for
printed
material
under
your
view
would
apply
to
television.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
if
it's
--
if
it's
not
obscene,
you
can
publish
it.
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
gravamen
of
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
two
broadcasters
in
this
case,
both
of
them
are
respondents,
one
is
fox
television
stations
inc.
and
the
other
is
abc.
they
have
been
involved
in
a
lengthy
dispute
with
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
dispute
arises
from
two
broadcasts
by
fox
and
one
by
abc
and
the
case
had
been
here
once
before.
the
opinion
describes
some
detail
of
the
procedural
history.
the
two
incidents
on
fox
were
broadcast
of
the
billboard
music
awards.
the
first
broadcast
was
in
2002,
the
second
in
2003.
in
the
first,
an
award
recipient
used
a
vulgar
word.
in
the
second,
the
announcer
used
the
vulgarity
a
couple
of
times.
the
incident
on
abc
concerned
a
2003
broadcast
episode
of
the
series
called
nypd
blue,
and
it
had
a
shower
scene
that
included
about
seven
seconds
of
adult
nudity.
the
question
is
whether
these
broadcasts
were
in
violation
of
a
federal
statute,
18
u.
s.
c.
1464
and
that
statute
prohibits
indecent
broadcast
and
the
fcc
has
authority
to
enforce
it.
in
1978,
this
court
in
fcc
versus
pacifica
foundation
upheld
the
fcc's
first
enforcement
action
under
the
statute.
that
was
the
case
that
involved
a
radio
broadcast
of
a
monologue
called
seven
dirty
words,
and
the
monologue
repeated
the
vulgar
words
a
number
of
times.
it
was
aired
during
the
daytime
broadcast
hours
when
children
were
more
at
risk
of
being
exposed
to
it
and
this
court
in
the
pacifica
case
noted
that
it
was
not
deciding,
not
deciding
whether
an
occasional
expletive
would
violate
the
statute.
now,
it's
the
occasional
or
fleeting
or
passing
reference
problem
that
is
involved
in
today's
cases.
since
the
1978
pacifica
case,
the
fcc
has
issued
various
policy
statements
or
rulings
on
this
subject.
in
2001,
before
the
fox
and
abc
broadcast,
the
fcc
said
that
the
fleeting
expletive
would
tend
to
weigh
against
the
finding
of
indecency,
but
then
after
the
fox
and
abc
broadcast
took
place
but
before
the
fcc
had
issued
notices
of
liability
to
those
broadcasters,
the
fcc
issued
a
ruling
in
another
case
and
that's
the
so-called
golden
globes
broadcast
case.
in
there,
the
fcc
held
that
use
of
a
specific
word
could
make
the
broadcaster
liable
even
if
the
word
were
not
repeated
and
even
if
it
was
a
so-called
fleeting
or
passing
reference.
the
fcc
applied
this
golden
globes
ruling
in
interpretation
to
the
fox
and
abc
broadcast
here.
fox
was
found
to
be
in
violation,
but
it
received
no
momentary
sanction
and
abc
was
fined
over
$1
million.
when
these
cases
came
to
this
court
three
years
ago,
fox
argued
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
fcc
to
change
its
policy.
and
this
court
disagreed
and
returned
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
noted
it
was
not
considering
the
constitutional
arguments
including
first
amendment
questions.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
fcc's
indecency
policy
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
vague.
that
court
invalidated
the
policy
in
its
entirety.
having
done
so,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
fcc's
sanctions
against
fox
and
relied
on
that
ruling
to
reverse
the
liability
finding
against
abc
for
the
nypd
blue
episode.
on
certiorari,
the
case
is
now
returned
here.
the
broadcasters
argue
that
the
fcc
policies
and
indeed
this
court's
holding
in
pacifica
are
an
unconstitutional
restriction
of
protected
speech.
this
court
does
not
reach
the
first
amendment
question
however
because
a
basic
due
process
concept
of
fair
notice
is
controlling
here.
these
broadcasters
did
not
have
fair
notice
of
the
fcc
policy.
in
sanctioning
these
broadcasters,
the
fcc
applied
the
new
standard
contained
in
the
2004
golden
globes
order,
an
order
that
was
issued
after
these
broadcasts
took
place,
and
it's
a
fundamental
principle
of
due
process
that
laws
must
give
fair
notice
of
the
conduct
that
is
forbidden
or
required.
the
fcc
gave
no
such
notice.
it
applied
the
policy
announced
after
the
sanctioned
broadcast
so
the
fcc
orders
against
fox
and
abc
must
be
set
aside.
it's
necessary
to
make
three
observations
about
the
scope
of
this
decision.
first,
because
the
court
resolves
this
case
under
the
due
process
clause,
it
does
not
address
the
first
amendment
implication
of
the
fcc's
policy
and
we
do
not
address
the
respondents'
arguments
that
we
should
reconsider
our
holding
in
pacifica
at
this
time.
second,
because
we
rule
that
abc
and
fox
lacked
notice
under
the
fcc's
policies
in
existence
in
2001,
unlike
the
second
circuit,
we
have
no
need
to
address
the
constitutionality
of
the
current
indecency
policy
as
expressed
in
the
2004
golden
globes
order.
third,
this
decision
leaves
the
fcc
free
to
modify
its
current
indecency
policy
in
light
of
its
determination
of
the
public
interest.
it
leaves
courts
free
to
review
the
current
policy
or
any
future
policy
in
light
of
its
content
and
application.
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
are
vacated.
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
