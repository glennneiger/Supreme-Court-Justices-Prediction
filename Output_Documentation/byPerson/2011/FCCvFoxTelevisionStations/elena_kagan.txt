but,
general
verrilli,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
contract
notion
of
yours
can
only
go
so
far.
i
mean,
if
the
idea
is
just,
we
gave
them
something,
now
they
have
to
do
whatever
we
say,
you
wouldn't
accept
that.
so
the
question
is
why
is
this
condition
appropriate
when
many
other
conditions
would
not
be
appropriate?
i
mean,
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
if
you
would
say
all
conditions
are
appropriate.
but
i
--
i
frankly
think
you
wouldn't.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
broader
point,
general
verrilli,
isn't
it,
is
that
no
matter
--
even
if
you
are
right
that
there
are
many
non-vague
applications
of
this
commission
policy,
that
there
is
some
amount
of
uncertainty
and
abc
finds
itself
in
that
area
of
uncertainty--
justice
elena
kagan
--because
it
turns
out
that
nudity
--
that
there
really
--
sometimes
it's
allowed
as
to
some
body
parts
and
sometimes
it's
not
allowed,
and
the
commission
hadn't
really
said
anything
about
it
for
50
years,
and
the
length
of
time
doesn't
seem
to
be
what's
indicative
of
anything,
the
kind
of
body
part
doesn't
seem
to
be,
with
some
limits,
what
is
indicative
of
anything,
so
that
abc
just
didn't
really
know.
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
goes--
justice
elena
kagan
--we're
almost
there,
right?
10
percent?
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
this,
mr.
phillips:
look,
you've
been
given
a
privilege
and
that
gives
the
government
at
least
somewhat
more
leeway
to
impose
obligation
on
you.
not
--
can't
impose
everything,
but
at
least
has
a
bit
more
leeway.
and
here
we've
had
something
that's
very
historically
grounded.
we've
had
this
for
decades
and
decades
that
the
broadcast
is
--
the
broadcaster
is
treated
differently.
it
seems
to
work
and
it
--
it
seems
to
be
a
good
thing
that
there
is
some
safe
haven,
even
if
the
old
technological
bases
for
that
safe
haven
don't
exist
anymore.
so
why
not
just
keep
it
as
it
is?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
what
a
person
sees
on
broadcast
channels
and
what
a
person
sees
on
basic
cable?
basic
cable
now?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
in
content.
is
there
a
difference
in
content?
because
basic
cable
channels
are
not
restricted
by
these
rules,
and
i
am
just
wondering
whether
you
think
there
is
a
difference.
because
i
--
it
has
not
been
apparent
to
me
that
there
is.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
i
think
that
the,
the
networks
really
are
saying:
well,
even
if
some
regulation
is
permissible,
the
kind
of
regulation
that
the
fcc
has
done
here
is
regulation
that
gives
it
complete
discretion
as
to
what
kind
of
speech
to
go
after
and
what
not
to
go
after;
that
it
has
not
tied
itself
in
any
way
to
any
kinds
of
standards.
and,
it's,
you
know,
evident
in
the
notion
that
this
--
the
way
that
this
policy
seems
to
work,
it's
like
nobody
can
use
dirty
words
or
nudity
except
for
steven
spielberg
and
that
there's
a
lot
of
room
here
for
fcc
enforcement
on
the
basis
of
what
speech
they
think
is
kind
of
nice
and
proper
and
good.
and
so
that's
a
serious
first
amendment
issue.
