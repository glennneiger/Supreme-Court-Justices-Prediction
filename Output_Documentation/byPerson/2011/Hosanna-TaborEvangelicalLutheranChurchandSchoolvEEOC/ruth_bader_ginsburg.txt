mr.
laycock,
could
you
clarify
one
point?
you
say
the
church
decides
who's
qualified
to
be
a
minister,
but,
as
i
understand
the
facts
here,
she
was
never
decommissioned
as
a
minister
and,
beyond
that,
she
was
even
recommended
by
the
officials
to
other
parishes
to
be
a
commissioned
minister.
so
it's
--
it's
odd
to
say
there
is
any
interferences
with
who
is
qualified
to
be
a
minister,
because
the
church
was
holding
her
out
as
being
qualified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
your
position
would
be
if
she's
a
commissioned
minister,
as
distinguished
from
a
teacher
who
conducts
grace
or
takes
the
class
to
chapel.
i'm
--
i'm
taking
--
the
chief
is
asking
for
somebody
in
this,
you
categorize
as
a
minister,
although
mostly
she's
a
math
teacher.
you
would
say
the
extent
of
her
religious
duties
don't
matter;
what
counts
is
that
she
is
commissioned
as
a
minister.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
it
was
part
of
--
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
no
fact
dispute
that
what
she
did,
her
duties
at
the
school,
did
not
change
from
when
she's
a
contract
teacher,
and
therefore
not
a
minister,
and
then
she
takes
courses
and
is
qualified
to
become
a
minister,
but
what
she's
doing
at
the
school
is
the
very
same
thing.
and
i
thought
that
was
the
basis
for
the,
the
decision
that
we
are
reviewing,
that
there
was
no
difference
at
all
in
what
she
did
before
she
was
commissioned
and
after
she
was
commissioned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
isolating
one
parish,
but
there
was
something
in
one
of
these
briefs
that
said
the
majority
of
the
teachers
in
the
lutheran
schools
--
let's
see
where
it
was.
i
think
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it
--
is
it
in
the
handbook?
i
mean,
one
of
the
objections
--
if
this
--
if
this
is
a
rule
that's
going
to
bind
a
teacher,
then
you
would
expect
to
find
it
in
the
handbook.
but
the
handbook
doesn't
tell
her,
if
you
complain
to
the
eeoc
about
discrimination
then
you
will
be
fired.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
laycock,
you,
in
order,
i
think,
to
dispel
the
notion
that
nothing
is
permitted,
in
your
reply
brief
you
say
that
there
are
many
suits
that
could
be
brought
that
would
not
be
inappropriate.
and
i
think
it's
on
page
20
of
your
reply
brief.
but
i
don't
understand
how
those
would
work
if
the
policy
is
you're
a
minister,
if
you
have
quarrels
with
the
church
or
a
co-worker,
we
have
our
own
dispute
resolution
and
you
don't
go
outside.
but
you
say
torts
arising
from
unsafe
working
conditions.
suppose
one
of
these
commissioned
workers
said:
i
think
that
there
are
unsafe
working
conditions
and
i'm
going
to
complain
to
the
occupational
health
and
safety
agency.
and
wouldn't
she
get
the
same
answer:
this
has
to
be
solved
in-house.
you
don't
go
to
an
agency
of
the
state.
why
--
i
don't
follow
why
the
tort
claim
based
on
unsafe
working
conditions
would
not
fall
under
the
same
ban
on
keeping
disputes
in-house?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
reason
that
she
was
unfit
for
the
ministry
was
that
she
went
outside
the
house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
all
of
these
cases,
you
go
outside
the
church,
you
go
to
the
government,
then
you
have
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
she
could
be,
for
any
of
these
things,
she
could
be
disciplined,
fired
because
she
complained
outside
the
house?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
tort
claim
could
proceed,
and
then
she
would
get
damages
and
that
would
be
all
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
say
--
did
i
understand
you
before,
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor
and
justice
scalia,
that
even
if
she
were
merely
a
contract
teacher,
the
fact
that
she
teaches
religion
classes
would
be
enough
for
her
to
qualify
for
the
ministerial
exception?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
clincher
in
this
case,
but
even
--
i
think
you
answered
if
she
were
not
a
commissioned
minister,
she's
teaching
the
faith,
therefore
she
can
be
fired,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
she's
commissioned,
so
the
commission
is
irrelevant.
it's
--
it's
her
job
duties
that
count?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
was
certainly
for
some
purposes,
i
mean,
if
every
teacher
who
teaches
religion
and
math
and
a
lot
of
other
things
said,
i'm
a
minister
and
i'm
entitled
to
the
parsonage
allowance
on
my
income
tax
return,
certainly
that's
something
that
a
government
agent
would
review.
