mr.
walter
dellinger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--i
believe
that
there
is
an
exemption
grounded
in
the
religion
clauses.
it
means
that
religious
organizations
will
win,
will
prevail
in
many
cases
in
which
a
comparable
civil
organization
would
not
prevail.
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
sense
to
approach
it
in
a
categorical
way
of
asking--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--well,
in
our
view,
if
that
was
the
test,
then
we
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
holding
that
she
was
not
a
minister,
and
the
reason
--
the
principal
reason
is
she
carries
out
such
important
secular
functions
in
addition
to
her
religious
duties--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--chief
justice
roberts,
i
do
not
want
to
suggest
that
it's
a
very
good
approach
to
try
to
decide
who
is
a
minister
and
who's
not
a
minister.
that's
what's
wrong
with
professor
laycock's
categorical
approach,
because
it's
--
it's
both
over
and
under-inclusive.
it
sweeps
in
cases
where
there
is
in
fact
no
religious
reason
offered--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--and
the
reason
that
is
not
a
satisfactory
test
is
that
it
fails
to
take
account
of
the
important
governmental
interests
--
for
example
in
this
case,
in
having
everyone
have
access
to
the
--
to
the
courts--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--well--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--if
we
go
to
congress,
congress
made
it
quite
clear
how
this
case
should
be
resolved,
because
congress
expressly
did
not
apply
the
religious
exemptions
of
the
ada
to
retaliation.
mr.
walter
dellinger
well,
we
differ
on
that,
but--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--it
is
still
the
case
it
is
a
constitutional
matter
--
the
state's
interest
in
allowing
citizens
to
have
access
to
its
courts
and
to
its
agencies
is
paramount
--
in
cases
like
child
abuse,
reporting
of
school
safety
problems
and
others.
in
this
case,
it's
--
we
are
mindful--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--no,
it
doesn't,
and
the
reason--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--the
reason
is
--
and
that
points
out,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
ample
doctrines
to
protect
church
autonomy.
one
is
that
under
the
establishment
clause,
there
can
be
no
reinstatement
ordered
by
a
court
of
someone
into
an
ecclesiastical
position.
another
mentioned
by
general
kruger
is
that--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--i
--
i
do
not
believe
that
he
can
be
reinstated
or
to
get
damages
for
removal
from
the
--
from
the
priesthood.
mr.
walter
dellinger
i
think
in
that
case
that
that
is
very
likely
to
fail
because
you're
going
to
run
into
a
--
issues
of
religious
doctrine,
or
evaluations
of
distinctly
religious
matters
like
eeoc
v.
catholic
university.
those
doctrines
still
stand.
the
problem
with
the
--
this
categorical
exception
is
it
sweeps
in
cases
like
this
one,
where
the
well-pleaded
complainant
in
this
case
simply
says
i
was
dismissed
from
my
employment
because
i
said
i
was
going
to
make
a
report
to
the
eeoc,
and
she's
not
seeking
reinstatement.
she
just
wants
the
economic
loss
--
there's
no
need--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--this
is
not
a
problem
that
is
unique
to
ministerial
employees,
which
is
why
this
is
both
over
and
under-inclusive.
when
you
--
this
is
a
circumstance
in
which
an
organization
is
going
into
the
public
arena
providing
a
public
service,
and
in
that
situation,
it
ought
to
be
governed
by
the
same
rules
--
justice
scalia,
you
said
this
case
is
not
like
employment
division
v.
smith,
but
under
employment
division
v.
smith,
we
know
that
the
state
could
forbid
a
school
from
--
a
religious
school
from
using
peyote
in
its
ceremonies,
but
under
petitioner's
submission,
they
could
fire
any
employee
who
reported
that
use
of
peyote
to
civil
authorities,
and
that
employee
would
have
no
recourse.
we
know
that
under
u.s.
v.
lee,
an
amish
employer
has
to
comply
with
the
social
security
laws,
but
under
their
submission,
the
employer
could
fire
without
recourse
any
employee
who
called
noncompliance
to
the
attention
of
the
eeoc.
we
believe
that
you
can
trust
congress
on
these
hard
areas
where
there
needs
to
be
additional
accommodations;
congress
could
make
them,
just
as
justice
scalia
suggested.
the
ministerial
exception
has
a
long
history,
justice
alito,
but
in
almost
every
circuit,
it
did
not
apply
to
teachers,
so,
i
mean--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--that
is
correct.
when
that
was
enacted--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--in
the
lower
courts,
it
did
not
apply
as
sweepingly
as
to
teachers.
and
i
think
we
had
this
debate
with
justice
breyer
about
whether
you
can
say
that
congress
specifically
excluded
retaliation
cases.
but
remember
that
that
doctrine
emerged
at
a
time
when
this
court
had
a
position
that
religious
organizations
could
not
participate
in
getting
public
funding,
even
when
they
are
provided
with
menial
services
to
low
income
students.
we
repudiated
that
doctrine
in
agostini
v.
felton
and
where
the
court
said
that
you're
entitled
to
participate
in
providing
public
services
on
the
same
basis
as
all
other
organizations.
that
means
that
you
should
comply,
in
some
instances,
with
the
same
rules.
when
you
leave
the
cloister
and
go
into
the
public
arena
and
provide
public
services.
mr.
walter
dellinger
no,
they
don't--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--but
they
are
entitled
to.
mr.
walter
dellinger
because
we
are
no
longer
--
we
are
no
longer
of
the
of
the
agostini
v.
felton
era,
the
employment
division
v.
smith
where
we
believe
that
no
governmental
rules
or
involvement
can
be
had
with
these
public
institutions.
mr.
walter
dellinger
no--
mr.
walter
dellinger
--it's
that
we
have
recognized
in
your
opinion
in
smith
and
in
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
rosenberger
the
value
of
neutrality
where
you
have
doctrines
--
if
we
recognize
--
you
do
not
second-guess
religious
doctrine.
you
do
not
under
the
establishment
clause
introduce
someone
into
an
ecclesiastical
office,
and
you
do
a
balancing
test
to
make
sure
that
there
is
a
sufficient
governmental
interest,
if
you're
going
to
undercut
an
organization's
ability
to
convey
its
views.
thank
you.
