justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
laycock,
the
ministerial
exception
is
not
something
new.
it
has
been
widely
recognized,
as
justice
sotomayor
mentioned,
by
the
courts
of
appeals
going
back
40
years.
so
we
can
see
how
the
recognition
of
this
exception
within
--
with
certain
contours,
has
worked
out,
and
how
has
it
worked
out
over
those
past
40
years?
have
there
been
a
great
many
cases,
a
significant
number
of
cases,
involving
the
kinds
of
things
that
justice
sotomayor
is
certainly
rightly
concerned
about,
instances
in
which
ministers
have
been
fired
for
reporting
criminal
violations
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
thought
with
a
lot
of
deference
to
the
church's
understanding
of
whether
someone
is
a
minister.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
laycock,
didn't
this
inquiry
illustrate
the
problems
that
will
necessarily
occur
if
you
get
into
a
pretext
analysis
--
the
question
of
was
she
told
that
she
had
violated
the
church's
teaching
about
suing
in
a
civil
tribunal.
well,
that
depends.
the
significance
of
--
let's
assume
she
wasn't
told.
the
significance
of
that
depends
on
how
central
a
teaching
of
lutheranism
this
is.
it's
like,
suppose
a
catholic
priest
got
married
and
the
bishop
said:
i'm
removing
you
from
your
parish
because
of
your
conduct.
now,
there
wouldn't
be
much
question
about
why
that
was
done.
so
you'd
have
to
get
in
--
what
did
martin
luther
actually
say
about,
2
about
suing
the
church
where
other
christians
in
a
civil
tribunal.
is
this
really
a
central
tenet
of
lutheranism?
isn't
that
the
problem
with
going
into
this
pretext
analysis.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
you
accept
the
proposition
that
one
of
the
central
concerns
of
the
establishment
clause
was
preventing
the
government
from
choosing
ministers?
when
there
was
an
established
church,
the
government
chose
the
ministers
or
had
a
say
in
choosing
the
ministers.
and
the
establishment
clause
many
argue
was
centrally
focused
on
eliminating
that
governmental
power.
now,
do
you
dispute
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
say
that,
are
you
not
implicitly
making
a
judgment
about
the
relative
importance
of
the
catholic
doctrine
that
only
males
can
be
ordained
as
priests
and
the
lutheran
doctrine
that
a
lutheran
should
not
sue
the
church
in
civil
courts?
i
don't
see
any
distinction
between
--
i
can't
reconcile
your
position
on
those
two
issues
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
you
think
that
the
catholic
doctrine
is
older,
stronger
and
entitled
to
more
respect
than
the
lutheran
doctrine.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
the
plaintiff
proceeded
that
way,
would
she
be
entitled
to
--
i
assume
she
would
--
introduce
testimony
by
experts
on
lutheranism,
theologians,
professors
of
religion
about
how
the
--
about
this
--
this
tenet,
and
it
isn't
really
--
they
might
say,
well,
it's
really
not
that
strong
and
it
once
was,
but
it's
faded,
and
it's
not
--
it's
not
widely
enforced.
and
then
you'd
have
experts
on
the
other
side,
and
you'd
have
a
court
and
a
lay
jury
deciding
how
important
this
really
is
to
lutherans.
is
that
how
that
would
play
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
are
we
going
to
avoid
that?
i
just
don't
see
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
it's
not
just
irrelevant.
i've
dozens
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
pretext
cases,
and
in
practically
every
pretext
case
that
i've
seen
one
of
the
central
issues
is
whether
the
reason
that
was
proffered
by
the
employer
is
the
real
reason,
is
an
important
reason
for
that,
for
that
employer,
and
whether
they
really
think
it's
important
and
whether
they
apply
it
across
the
board.
that's
almost
always
a
big
part
of
the
case.
and
once
you
get
into
that,
you're
going
to
get
into
questions
of
--
of
religious
doctrine.
i
just
don't
see
it.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
a
real
case.
a
nun
wanted
to
be
--
wanted
a
tenured
position
teaching
canon
law
at
catholic
university
and
she
claimed
that
she
was
denied
tenure
because
of
her
--
because
of
her
gender.
now,
there
the
university
might
argue,
no,
she's
--
and
did
argue
--
she's
denied
tenure
because
of
the
quality
of
her,
of
her
scholarship.
and
okay,
now,
if
you
just
try
that
pretext
issue,
the
issue
is
going
to
be
what
is
the
real
quality
of
her
canon
law
scholarship?
and
you're
going
to
have
the
judge
and
the
jury
decide
whether
this
particular
writings
on
canon
law
are
--
make
a
contribution
to
canon
law
scholarship.
how
can
something
like
that
be
tried,
without
getting
into
religious
issues?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
just
come
back
to
the
example
of
the
canon
law,
professor,
because
i
still
don't
see
how
the
--
the
approach
that
the
solicitor
general
is
recognizing
is
recommending
could
--
can
eliminate
the
problems
involved
in
pretext.
so
the
--
the
--
as
i
understood
her
--
her
answer,
it
was
that
you
couldn't
look
into
the
question
of
whether
the
professor's
canon
law
scholarship
was
really
good
canon
law
scholarship,
but
you
could
try
the
issue
of
sex
discrimination
based
on
other
evidence.
so
maybe
there
is
some
stray
remarks
here
and
there
about
a
woman
teaching
canon
law.
now,
a
response
to
that
might
be
that
wasn't
the
real
reason
--
and
if
you
just
look
at
the
scholarship
and
you
see
how
miserable
it
is
and
how
inconsistent
it
is
with
church
doctrine,
you
could
see
that
that's
the
real
reason
for
it.
so
you
just
cannot
get
away
from
evaluating
religious
issues.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
antedated.
did
it
not
antedate
the
enactment
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
shouldn't
we
assume
that
congress
--
that
congress
--
assumed
that
it
would
continue
to
apply
to
the
ada,
just
as
it
applied
to
title
vii.
