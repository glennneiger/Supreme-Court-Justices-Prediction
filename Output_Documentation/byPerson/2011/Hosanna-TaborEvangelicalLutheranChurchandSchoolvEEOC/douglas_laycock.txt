mr.
douglas
laycock
mr.
chief
justice
and
play
it
please
the
court:
the
churches
do
not
set
the
criteria
for
selecting
or
removing
the
officers
of
government,
and
government
does
not
set
the
criteria
for
selecting
and
removing
officers
of
the
church.
that's
a
bedrock
principle
and
these
respondents
would
repudiate
it.
they
no
longer
seriously
argue
that
cheryl
perich
was
not
a
minister.
instead
they
argue
that
even
people
who
are
indisputably
ministers
can
sue
their
churches
on
claims
that
turn
on
their
qualifications,
their
job
performance
and
the
rules
of
ministry.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
she
was
removed
from
her
ministry
at
hosanna-tabor.
they
do
not
have
to
indulge
in
a
vendetta
against
her
and
file
charges
with
the
synod.
and
if
you
look
at
that
recommendation
--
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
--
it
is
not
much
of
a
recommendation.
there
is
excellent,
commendable,
proficient,
and
in
ministry
qualities
she
gets
proficient.
we
all
know
if
there
is
a
5,
a
4
and
a
3,
a
3
isn't
very
good.
so
they
were
not
recommending
her;
they
simply
weren't
pursuing
formal
charges
against
her
before
the
--
before
the
missouri
synod.
and
--
and
--
and
the
problems
they
had
were
most
severe
at
hosanna-tabor.
in
another
congregation
that
didn't
know
this
history,
she
might
have
been
able
to
be
effective
again.
that
was
for
them
to
decide.
they
make
their
own
calls.
but
she
was
removed
at
hosanna-tabor,
which
is
where
the
problem
was.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
cases,
they
have
not
indulged
in
pretext
inquiries
for
ministers.
the
case
you
present
is
obviously
a
difficult
case,
and
i
would
say
two
things.
we
think
the
appropriate
rule
should
be
the
government
can
do
many
things
to
force
reporting,
to
penalize
people
who
don't
report,
but
a
discharge
claim
by
a
minister
presents
the
question
why
she
was
discharged
and
the
court
should
stay
out
of
that.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
understand
that
concern,
and
that
was
my
second
point,
that
if
you
want
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
cases
like
child
abuse
where
the
government's
interest
is
in
protecting
the
child,
not
an
interest
in
protecting
the
minister,
when
you
get
such
a
case,
we
think
you
could
carve
out
that
exception.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
--
first
you
have
to
identify
the
government's
interest
in
regulation.
if
the
government's
interest
is
in
protecting
ministers
from
discrimination,
we
are
squarely
within
the
heart
of
the
ministerial
exception.
if
the
government's
interest
is
something
quite
different
from
that,
like
protecting
the
children,
then
you
can
assess
whether
that
government
interest
is
sufficiently
compelling
to
justify
interfering
with
the
relationship
between
the
church
and
its
ministers.
but
the
government's
interest
is
at
its
nadir
when
the
claim
is
we
want
to
protect
these
ministers
as
such,
we
want
to
tell
the
churches
what
criteria
they
should
apply
for
--
for
selecting
and
removing
ministers.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
only
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
case.
the
--
the
one
case
i
am
aware
of
cuts
the
other
way.
a
minister,
a
priest
accused
of
sexually
abusing
children
who
was
fired,
sued
to
get
his
job
back,
and
the
church
invoked
the
ministerial
exception
and
that
case
ended.
they
were
able
to
get
rid
of
him.
there
is
a
cert
petition
pending
in
which
a
teacher
with
a
long
series
of
problems
in
her
school
called
the
police
about
an
allegation
of
sexual
abuse
that
did
not
happen
at
the
school,
did
not
involve
a
student
of
the
school,
did
not
involve
a
parent
at
the
school,
someplace
else;
and
--
and
called
the
police
and
had
them
come
interview
a
student
without
any
communication
with
--
with
her
principal.
and
the
respondents
tried
to
spin
that
as
a
case
of
discharge
for
reporting
sexual
abuse.
but
if
you
look
at
the
facts
it's
really
quite
different.
and
those
are
the
only
two
cases
i'm
aware
of
that
even
approach
touching
on
this
problem.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
she
can't
get
a
hearing
in
civil
court.
she
could
have
had
a
hearing
in
the
synod
before
decisionmakers
who
would
have
been
independent
of
the
local
church.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
churches
can
create
tribunals
for
the
governance
of
their
officers.
the
churches--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well
it's
an
argument
we
make
in
the
hearing
on
whether
the
ministerial
exception
applies.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
we
are
asking
to
apply
the
exemption--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
was
precisely
a
motion
for--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i'm
not
entirely
sure
i
understand
the
question.
we
agree
she
couldn't
go
to
civil
court
if
she's
a
minister.
she
could
have
gone
to
the
synod.
she
wasn't
cut
off
from
that.
she
decided
not
to.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
understand
that.
but
once
you
start
to
litigate
these
cases--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
one
of
my
points,
maybe
the
most
important
of
my
points.
these
--
these
decisions
are
committed
to
churches
by
separation
of
church
and
state,
but
--
but
beyond
that,
once
the
--
this
process
of
trying
to
identify,
we
can
decide
some
issues
in
this
case
and
we
won't
get
to
other
issues
in
this
case,
doesn't
work.
as
justice
breyer
said
in
a
first
circuit
opinion,
that
requires
more
and
more
finely
spun
distinctions
that
create
entanglement
rather
than
avoid
it.
universe
of
dodd.
mr.
douglas
laycock
right.
here
i
think
it's
very
easy.
she's
a
commissioned
minister
in
the
church.
she
holds
ecclesiastical
office.
she
teaches
the
religion
class.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
person
is
not
covered
and
we
are
not
challenging
that
rule.
obviously,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
quantitative
threshold.
there
will
be
line-drawing
problems.
but--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--if
she's
commissioned
as
a
minister
and
if
that
is
not
a
sham,
then
we
think
that
makes
her
a
minister.
if
you
have
a
jesuit
teaching
physics,
we
think
he
is
still
a
priest
and
he
is
still
controlled
by
the
ministerial
exception.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
i
--
i
certainly
meant
something
different
from
a
pretext.
a
sham
is
more
extreme,
and
it
goes
to
a
different
point
in
the
analysis.
you
can
decide
whether
she
is
really
a
minister.
that's
a
threshold
question
the
courts
must
decide.
and
if
we
have
a
person
with
a
ministerial
title
who
is
doing
nothing
at
all
religious
or
ministerial,
if
we
have
a
church
who
tries
to
say
everyone
who
ever
worked
for
us
or
ever
may
is
a
minister,
the
courts
can
deal
with
those
cases
if
they--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
right.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
means
that.
and
again,
i
--
i,
you
know,
i
think
courts
have
some
capacity
to
look
at
what
this
employee
is
actually
doing,
and
if
he
is
not
performing
any
of
the
functions
of
a
religious
leader,
if
he
is
not
teaching
the
faith,
then--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i
understand
that.
and
lay
people
in
many
churches
are
expected
to
be
witnesses,
so--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--lay
people
have
to
be
witnesses.
the
fact
that
you're
expected
to
witness
to
the
faith
when
the
occasion
arises
doesn't
make
you,
doesn't
make
you
a
minister.
mr.
douglas
laycock
how
--
how
many
religious
functions
you
perform
can
be
explored.
the
issue
that
can
be
explored
is
whether
she's
a
minister.
we
think
she
clearly
is.
the
issue--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
we
think
there
should
be
deference
to
good
faith
understandings.
but
we
are
not
arguing
for
a
rule
that
would
enable
an
organization
to
fraudulently
declare
that
everyone
is
a
minister
when
it's
not
true.
you
decided
the
tony
alamo
case
20
years
ago.
we're
not
defending
that.
mr.
douglas
laycock
we
think
--
we
think
if
you
teach
the
doctrines
of
faith,
if
that
is
per
your
job
responsibilities
to
teach
the
doctrines
of
the
faith,
we
think
you're
a
minister.
mr.
douglas
laycock
if
you're
ordained
or
commissioned,
that
makes
it
very
easy.
if
you
teach
the
religion
class,
you
teach
an
entire
class
on
religion,
we
think
you
ought
to
be
within
this
rule.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
--
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
what
they
--
what
--
you
know,
i
don't
think
that
changes
the
nature
of
the
functions
that
were
being
performed.
but
what's
relevant
to
that,
that
they
neglected
was
these
noncommissioned
--
these
teachers
who
were
not
commissioned
ministers,
the
lay
and
contract
teachers,
were
fill-ins
only
when
no
called
teacher
was
available,
and
perich
identifies
only
1
person
for
1
year.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
it
doesn't--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it's
not
uncommon,
even
with
ordained
ministers,
it's
not
uncommon
among
protestants,
to
recognize
an
ordination
from
a
different
denomination
that
has
similar
teachings.
so
when
--
when
they
can't
find
a
called
minister
to
cover
a
class
and
they
hire
another
christian
from
another
conservative
protestant
denomination,
they
say:
while
you
teach
here,
you're
required
to
teach
lutheran
doctrine.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
douglas
laycock
if
she
teaches
a
religion
class,
not
if
she
merely
leads
a
prayer.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
think
if
you
teach
the
religion
class,
you're
clearly
a
minister.
but
if
you
are
--
if
you
hold
an
ecclesiastical
office,
that
makes
this
a
very
easy--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
my
first
objection
is
i
don't
think
those
are
remotely
the
facts
here.
you
know,
this
teaching
is
clearly
stated,
embodied
in
an
elaborate
dispute
resolution
process.
you
don't
ask
for--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--indeed.
mr.
douglas
laycock
page
55
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
the
letter
that
--
where
they
tell
her
that
they
are
going
to
recommend
recission
of
her
call,
they
say
because
--
because
of
insubordination,
and
because
you
threatened
to
sue
us.
mr.
douglas
laycock
you
don't
assess
the
importance
of
a
doctrine
by
asking
the
person--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
i
don't
know
if
it
does
or
it
doesn't,
because
the
handbook
is
not
in
the
record
except
for
a
short
excerpt.
but
she
knew
about
this
rule.
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes.
the
principal
in
her
deposition
says:
the
minute
she
said
she
might
sue,
i
said:
you
can't
do
that;
you're
a
called
teacher.
the
testimony
is
the
board
talked
about
it
at
their
meeting
on
february
22nd.
i
think
that's
also
in
the
principal's
deposition.
the
president
of
the
congregation,
who
did
not
deal
directly
with
perich,
said
--
said
it
was
one
of
the
first
things
that
he
thought
about.
perich
was
a
lifelong
lutheran.
she
worked
years
in
lutheran
schools.
she
had
these
eight
theology
courses.
simply
not
credible
that
she
didn't
know
about
this
doctrine.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
just
part
of
the
problem.
you've
got
to
figure,
how
does
this
doctrine
work?
how
important
is
it?
how
does
it
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case?
how
does
it
interact
with
other
doctrines?
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
it
may
or
it
may
not.
the
--
the
rule
on
internal
dispute
resolution
is
most
emphatically
and
clearly
stated
as
applying
to
disputes
over
fitness
for
ministry,
and
a
tort
claim
may
not
be
a
dispute
over
fitness
for
ministry.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
laycock
what
we
say
in
the
passages
in
the
reply
brief
that
you're
looking
at
is
the
legal
doctrine,
the
ministerial
exception
as
a
matter
of
law,
does
not
apply
unless
the
dispute
is
over
whether
i
get
the
job
back,
job
qualifications,
job
performance
or
rules
of
ministry.
the
church's
rule--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--she
could
be.
and
her
tort,
the
tort
claim
would
proceed.
we
think
the
retaliation
claim
should
not
proceed.
mr.
douglas
laycock
she
would
get
damages
for
the
tort.
she
would
not
get
damages
for
the
loss
of
her
position.
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes.
and
the
fact
that
she's
a
commissioned
minister
is
the
clincher
in
this
case.
teaching--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--job
duties
are
enough.
commission
is
not
irrelevant.
it
is
the
clincher.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
they
do
review
it
there.
i
think
they
--
i
don't
think
the
lutherans
have
any
problems
with
the
irs
on
that.
but
yes,
that
is
a
context
where
they
review
these
questions.
if
i
could
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
i
would
be
grateful.
mr.
douglas
laycock
two
or
three
points
very
briefly.
the
many
distinctions
and
balancing
tests
in
their
argument
showed
the
mess
you
will
be
in
if
you
try
to
decide
these
cases.
and
we
may
have
a
line-drawing
problem
with
the
margin,
but
many,
many
are
easy:
the
priest,
the
rabbi,
the
bishop,
the
pastor
of
the
congregation
cannot
sue.
under
their
rule,
they
can
sue--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--no.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
position
of
minister
is
categorically
special
because
that
has
committed
the
church
in
the
system
of
separation
of
church
and
state.
you
may
have
religious
questions
when
they
dismiss
the
janitor,
but
the
level
of
sensitivity
is
not
remotely
the
same.
and--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--janitor
can
litigate
his
pretext
question.
yes.
mr.
douglas
laycock
a
minister
is
a
person
who
holds
ecclesiastical
office
in
the
church
or
who
exercises
important
religious
functions,
most
obviously,
including
teaching
of
the
faith.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it's
not
that
institutions
are
different
from
individuals.
it
is
that
the
institutional
governance
of
the
church
is
at
a
prior
step.
smith
is
about
whether
people
can
act
on
their
religious
teachings
after
they
are
formulated.
the
selection
of
ministers
is
about
the
process
by
which
those
religious
teachings
will
be
formulated.
smith
distinguishes
those--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--the
establishment
clause--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
the
second
answer--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--this
score
has
relied
on
both
free
exercise
and
establishment.
serbian,
kedreff,
kreshik,
gonzalez.
there's
a
long
line
of
cases
all
the
way
back
to
watson
distinguishing
this
problem
from
the
problem
that
culminates
in
smith.
