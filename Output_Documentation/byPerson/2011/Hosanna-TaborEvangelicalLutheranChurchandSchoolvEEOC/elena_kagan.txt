is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
would
it
mean
that
any
religious
teacher
is
a
minister
under
your
theory?
so,
you
know,
there
may
be
teachers
in
religious
schools
who
teach
religious
subjects,
not
mathematics,
but
are
not
ordained
or
commissioned
in
any
way
as
ministers.
are
they
ministers?
justice
elena
kagan
miss
kruger,
if
i
could
just
clarify
for
a
second
there,
because
you're
now
sounding
as
though
you
want
to
draw
a
sharp
line
between
retaliation
claims
and
substantive
discrimination
claims,
and
i
didn't
get
that
from
your
brief.
so
is
that,
in
fact,
what
you're
saying?
justice
elena
kagan
so
are
you
willing
to
accept
the
ministerial
exception
for
substantive
discrimination
claims,
just
not
for
retaliation
claims?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
believe,
miss
kruger,
that
a
church
has
a
right
that's
grounded
in
the
free
exercise
clause
and-or
the
establishment
clause
to
institutional
autonomy
with
respect
to
its
employees?
justice
elena
kagan
so
this
is
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
because
i
too
find
that
amazing,
that
you
think
that
the
free
--
neither
the
free
exercise
clause
nor
the
establishment
clause
has
anything
to
say
about
a
church's
relationship
with
its
own
employees.

could

could
you

justice
elena
kagan
--i
feel
like
i
missed
something.
mr.
dellinger,
could
you
assume
for
me
that
there
is
a
ministerial
exception
that's
founded
in
the
religion
clauses,
and
tell
me
who
counts
as
a
minister,
and
why
this
commissioned
minister
does
not
count
as
a
minister?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
just
asking
you
to
assume
with
me
for
a
moment
that
there
is
a
categorical
exception,
and
to
tell
me
who
you
think
counts
as
a
minister,
and
why
the
woman
in
this
case
does
not.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
laycock,
mr.
dellinger
has
some
points
here
about
the
way
in
which
the
ministerial
exception
relates
or
doesn't
relate
to
employment
division
v.
smith.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
make
an
argument
of
the
ministerial
exception,
you
in
some
sense
have
to
say
that
institutional
autonomy
is
different
from
individual
conscience;
that
we
have
said
in
smith
that
state
interests
can
trump
individual
conscience.
and
you
want
us
to
say
that
they
can't
trump
institutional
autonomy.
so
why
is
that?
