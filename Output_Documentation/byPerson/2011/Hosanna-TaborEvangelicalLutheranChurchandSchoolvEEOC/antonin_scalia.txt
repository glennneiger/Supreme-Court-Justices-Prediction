justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
point
is
that
it's
--
it's
none
of
the
business
of
the
government
to
decide
what
the
substantial
interest
of
the
church
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
try
whether
it's
a
sham?
i
thought
you
said
we
couldn't
try
whether
it's
a
sham.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
a
sham
different
from
a
pretext?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
allow
the,
the
government
courts
to
probe
behind
the
church's
assertion
that
this
person
is
a
minister?
you
would
allow
that,
right?
but
once
it
is
determined
that
the
person
is
a
minister,
you
would
not
allow
the
government
to
decide
whether
the
firing
was
a
pretext?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
term
is
a
legal
term.
what
constitutes
a
minister
is
--
is
decided
by
the
law,
not
by
the
church,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
makes
it
not
true?
what
is
the
legal
definition
of
"minister"?
what
is
it?
that
you
have
to
lead
the
congregation
in
their
religious
services
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
this
is
--
you're
saying
a
fortiori,
but
basically
you'd
be
here
anyway
even
if
she
hadn't
been
ordained;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
extraordinary.
that
is
extraordinary.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
free
exercise
clause
and
about
the
establishment
clause,
and
you
say
they
have
no
special
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
explicitly
prohibits
the
government
from
mucking
around
in
a
labor
organization.
now,
yes,
you
--
you
can
by
an
extension
of
first
amendment
rights
derive
such
a
--
but
there,
black
on
white
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
are
special
protections
for
religion.
and
you
say
that
makes
no
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
the
balancing
of
interests
is
different,
according
to
the
petitioner,
when
one
of
the
interests
is
religion.
and
you're
just
denying
that.
you're
saying:
we
balance
religion
the
way
we
balance
labor
organizations.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
certainly
not
what
the
petitioner
is
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
with
respect
to
their
religion
classes
and
their
theology
classes?
it's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
because
--
just
because
you
have
to
comply
with
state
education
requirements
on
secular
subjects,
your
--
who
you
pick
to
--
to
teach
theology
or
to
teach
religion
has
to
be
--
has
to
be
subject
to
state
control?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
they
--
they
merge
at
all.
smith
didn't
involve
employment
by
a
church.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
who
--
who
the
church
could
employ.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
that
has
any
relevance
to
this.
i
would
--
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
you
--
you
say
that
there
were
different
institutional
values
or
government
values
involved
with
respect
to
a
--
to
a
catholic
priest
than
there
is
with
respect
to
this
lutheran
minister.
let's
assume
that
a
catholic
priest
is
--
is
removed
from
his
duties
because
he
married,
okay?
and,
and
he
claims:
no,
that's
not
the
real
reason;
the
real
reason
is
because
i
threatened
to
sue
the
church.
okay?
so
that
reason
is
just
pretextual.
would
you
--
would
you
allow
the
government
to
go
--
go
into
the
--
into
the
dismissal
of
the
catholic
priest
to
see
whether
indeed
it
--
it
was
pretextual?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
any
different
from
the
lutheran
minister?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
saying
nothing
different
than
what
the
chief
justice
suggests,
that
you
think
the
one
is
more
--
is
more
important
to
--
to
catholics
than
the
other
is
to
lutherans.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
if
we
adopt
your
test
--
why
isn't
it
a
perfectly
reasonable
test
whether
the
person
--
although
the
person
may
have
a
lot
of
secular
duties
--
whether
the
person
has
substantial
religious
responsibilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
paramount.
would
you
--
would
you
--
take
the
firing
of
the
catholic
priest
example.
does
that
get
into
the
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
can
sue
for
money;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
sue
for
money.
he
can
sue
for,
you
know,
the
loss
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
lutheran
schools
and
catholic
parochial
schools
share
public
funds
the
same
way
public
schools
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
this
argument
you're
making?
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
tell
me
that
fair
is
fair,
that
now,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
like
everybody
else.
that's
not
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
might
not
the
establishment
clause
have
something
to
do
with
that
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
applies
to
institutions?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
the
free
exercise
clause
applies
to
individuals.
