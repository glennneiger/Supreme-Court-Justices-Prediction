justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
--
take,
what
is
your
reaction
to
a
less
dramatic
kind
of
holding?
suppose
we
were
to
say
the
truth
is
that
the
particular
individual
here
does
have
some
religious
obligations
in
teaching
and
quite
a
lot
that
aren't.
so
she
is
sort
of
on
the
edge.
at
the
same
time,
there
is
a
statute
which,
whether
it
applies
or
not,
you
could
take
the
principle,
and
it
says
a
religious
organization
like
your
client
may
require
that
she
conform
to
the
religious
tenets
of
the
organization.
so
congress
focused
on
this.
and
the
district
court
looks
at
it
--
and
suppose
it
were
to
decide:
that's
true,
but
there
is
no
evidence
here
at
all
that
religious
tenets
had
anything
to
do
with
her
being
dismissed.
no
one
mentioned
them.
she
didn't
know
about
them.
i
didn't
until
i
read
the
very
excellent
brief
filed
by
the
lutherans
that
explained
the
nature
of
taking
civil
suits.
no
one
said
that
to
her,
whether
it
was
in
someone's
mind
or
not.
she
found
out
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
so
therefore
this
wasn't
an
effort
by
the
religious
organization
to
express
its
tenets.
she
was
dismissed.
she
could
have
--
they
could
have
had
a
defense,
but
it
doesn't
apply,
and
therefore,
even
though
she's
sort
of
like
a
minister,
she
loses.
what
are
your
objections
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
anyone
mention
that
to
her?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
my
law
clerk
couldn't
find
it.
can
you
tell
me
where,
where
someone
did
say
the
reason
we
are
dismissing
you
is
because
of
our
religious
doctrine
that
you
cannot
bring
civil
suits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
does
anyone
explain
to
her,
which
she
might
not
have
known,
that
this
is
a
religious
doctrine
that
you
are
supposed
to
go
to
the
synod
or
whatever,
and
you're
not
supposed
to
go
to
court?
of
course
they
wanted
to
fire
her
because
she
threatened
to
sue
them.
but
what
i'm
wondering
is,
is
there
anywhere
before
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
where
someone
explains
to
her,
our
motivation
here
is
due
to
our
religious
tenet?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
understand
that.
but
i
would
argue
a
different
piece
of
matter,
that
the
people
who
were
involved
in
this
were
doing
it
for
religious
rather
than
civil
reasons.
i'm
just
wondering
what
the
evidence
is
that
they
knew
there
was
such
a
doctrine,
that
they
were
motivated
by
the
religious
doctrine,
and
that
they
expressed
that
to
her.
i
just
--
i'll
look
at
page
55.
is
there
anything
else
i
should
look
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
mr.
laycock,
we're
looking
for
a
citation
in
the
record.
i
just
wonder,
is
there
anything
you
want
me
to
read
other
than
page
55?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
that
that's
a
central
tenet.
suppose
you
have
a
religion
and
the
central
tenet
is:
you
have
a
problem
with
what
we
do,
go
to
the
synod;
don't
go
to
court.
and
that
applies
to
civil
actions
of
all
kinds.
all
right?
so
would
that
not
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
view
is
it's
not
protected?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
fact
if
they
want
to
choose
to
the
priest,
you
could
go
to
the
catholic
church
and
say
they
have
to
be
women.
i
mean,
you
couldn't
say
that.
that's
obvious.
so
how
are
you
distinguishing
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying
that
going
to
church
--
sorry
--
that
going
to
court
is
a
more
fundamental
interest
than
a
woman
obtaining
the
job
that
she
wants,
which
happens
in
this
case
to
be
a
catholic
priest.
but
that's
the
distinction
you're
making.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know
why
that
doesn't
--
i
mean,
you
may
be
right,
but
it
isn't
obvious
to
me
that
the
one
is
the
more
important
than
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
then
you
have
to
say
that
it's
more
important
to
let
people
go
to
court
to
sue
about
sex
discrimination
than
it
is
for
a
woman
to
get
a
job.
i
can't
say
that
one
way
or
the
other,
so
--
so
i'm
stuck.
and
since
--
since
i'm
really
--
this
is
tough
and
i'm
stuck
on
this,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
going
into
religion
to
some
degree.
you
have
to
decide
if
this
is
really
a
minister,
for
example,
and
what
kind
of
minister.
that
gets
you
right
involved.
or
if
you're
not
going
to
do
that,
you're
going
to
go
look
to
see
what
are
their
religious
tenets?
and
that
gets
you
right
involved.
i
just
can't
see
a
way
of
getting
out
of
something
--
of
getting
out
of
the
whole
thing.
i
don't
see
how
to
do
it.
so
suppose
you
said
in
case
of
doubt
like
that,
we'll
try
what
congress
suggested.
and
now
we
have
here
a
borderline
case
of
ministry,
not
the
heartland
case.
so
you
say,
all
right,
where
you
have
a
borderline
case
the
constitutional
issue
goes
away
and
what
congress
said
is
okay,
so
now
what
you
have
to
prove
is
you
have
to
prove
that
the
church
has
to
show
that
the
applicant
was
disciplined
or
whatever
because
she
didn't
conform
to
the
religious
tenets.
all
right?
that's
what
they
have
to
show.
and
i'm
sorry;
they
maybe
only
make
a
prima
facie
case,
but
they
got
to
show
it,
and
if
they
don't
show
that
there
was
at
least
some
evidence
to
that
effect
and
that
somebody
knew
about
the
religious
tenet
and
there
was
something
like
that
--
maybe
it's
in
the
air,
as
is
obvious
with
justice
alito's
question.
but
where
it
isn't
in
the
air,
you'd
have
to
make
a
showing.
now
i
--
i
see
that's
an
interference,
but
--
but
i
don't
see
how
you
avoid
an
interference
someplace
or
the
other.
otherwise
you're
going
to
get
into
who
is
a
minister.
so
what's
the
answer
to
this
dilemma?
at
the
moment
i'm
making
an
argument
for
following
what
congress
said,
go
back
and
try
it
that
way,
and
if
they
can
show
in
this
case
and
she
shows
in
this
case
nobody
ever
thought
of
this
religious
tenet,
nobody
told
me,
they
didn't
read
it,
then
she's
going
to
win.
and
if
they
come
in
and
show
that
they
really
did
this
because
of
their
religious
tenet,
they
will
win.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
does
have
the
virtue
of
deciding
a
statutory
question
before
a
tough
constitutional
question.
and
i
agree,
with
what
we
sometimes
do,
that
seems
bizarre,
but
i
thought
that
was
the
basic
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
the
problem.
the
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
is
i
don't
know
how
substantial
these
interests
are
religiously.
i
don't
know
how
substantial
the
religion
itself
considers
what
they
do
from
a
religious
perspective.
so
let's
go
back
to
justice
alito's
problem.
and
now
on
the
ministerial
issue,
we
call
the
synods,
we
call
the
how
certain
was
it
--
how
central
is
it
to
the
heart
of
the
religion
what
they're
actually
doing,
and
we
replicate
exactly
what
he
said
--
in
respect
to
the
problem
of
religious
tenet
--
now
in
respect
to
the
problem
of
religious
minister.
and
maybe
you
can
tell
me
we
don't
have
to
go
into
the
one
or
the
other,
but
i've
had
enough
of
these
cases
in
the
lower
court
to
know
they
are
really
hard.
people
believe
really
different
things,
and
i
see
no
way
to
avoid
going
into
one
or
the
other,
and
therefore,
i
think,
rather
than
try
this
constitutional
matter,
let's
go
to
the
one
congress
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
do
you,
that's
--
that's
the
state
of
the
argument
that
you're
walking
into,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
--
i
think
what
it
says
is
a
religious
organization
may
require
that
all
applicants
and
employees
conform
to
the
religious
tenets.
it
put
that
in
the
section
defining
defenses.
the
defenses
are
part
of
the
right,
and
when
it
forbids
retaliation,
it
says
retaliation
against
an
individual
for
the
exercise
of
any
right
granted.
and
therefore,
i
don't
believe
that
a
person
who
has
failed
to
violate
the
substantive
section
could
be
held
up
normally.
i
mean,
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
can
think
it's
pretty
easy
to
read
that
exception,
even
though
it's
in
a
different
subchapter,
into
the
retaliation
exception.
assume
for
me
that
that's
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
bet
they
don't.
