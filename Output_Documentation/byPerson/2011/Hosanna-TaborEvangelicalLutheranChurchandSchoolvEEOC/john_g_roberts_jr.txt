roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-553,
hosanna-tabor
evangelical
lutheran
church
and
school
v.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
mr.
laycock.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
referred
to
the
ministerial
exception,
but
of
course
your
position
extends
beyond
ministers.
how
do
we,
how
do
we
decide
who's
covered
by
the
ministerial
exception
and
who
is
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say
it's
a
teacher
who
teaches
only
purely
secular
subjects,
but
leads
the
class
in
grace
before
lunch.
is
that
somebody
who
would
be
covered
by
the
ministerial
exception?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
different
churches
have
different
ideas
about
who's
a
minister.
there
are
some
churches
who
think
all
of
our
adherents
are
ministers
of
our
faith.
now,
does
that
mean
that
everybody
who
is
a
member
of
that
church
qualifies
as
a
minister
because
that
is
part
of
the
church's
belief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
every
one
of
our
adherents
stands
as
a
witness
to
our
beliefs.
and
that
--
you
know,
not
every
church
is
hierarchical
in
terms
of
different
offices.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
there
is
a
ministerial
exception
or
that
there
is
not
a
ministerial
exception?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
nothing
to
do
with
respect
to
the
ministers.
in
other
words,
is
there
a
ministerial
exception
distinct
from
the
right
of
association
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
anything
special
about
the
fact
that
the
people
involved
in
this
case
are
part
of
a
religious
organization?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
no?
you
say
it's
similar
to
other
cases.
expressive
associations,
a
group
of
people
who
are
interested
in
labor
rights
have
expressive
associations.
is
the
issue
we
are
talking
about
here
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
any
different
than
any
other
group
of
people
who
get
together
for
an
expressive
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that
question
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
making
--
you're
making
a
judgment
about
how
important
a
particular
religious
belief
is
to
a
church.
you're
saying
--
this
may
just
be
the
same
question
justice
alito
asked
--
but
you're
saying:
we
don't
believe
the
lutheran
church
when
it
says
that
this
is
an
important
and
central
tenet
of
our
faith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
other
hand,
the
--
the
belief
of
the
catholic
church
that
priests
should
be
male
only,
you
do
defer
to
that,
even
if
the
lutherans
say,
look,
our
dispute
resolution
belief
is
just
as
important
to
a
lutheran
as
the
all-male
clergy
is
to
a
catholic.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
--
justice
kagan--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
that
can't
be
the
test.
the
pope
is
a
head
of
state
carrying
out
secular
functions;
right.
those
are
important.
so
he
is
not
a
minister?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
mr.
laycock,
two
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
number
10-553,
hosanna-tabor
evangelical
lutheran
church
and
school
versus
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
hosanna-tabor
evangelical
lutheran
church
operated
a
small
school
in
michigan
for
students
in
kindergarten
through
8th
grade.
the
school
had
two
types
of
teachers,
called
teachers
and
lay
teachers.
called
teachers
were
regarded
by
the
church
as
having
been
called
to
their
vocation
by
god.
to
become
a
called
teacher,
a
candidate
had
to
complete
certain
academic
requirements,
including
a
course
of
theological
study.
once
called,
a
teacher
received
the
formal
title
"minister
of
religion,
commissioned."
lay
teachers,
by
contrast,
were
not
required
to
have
theological
training
or
even
to
be
lutheran.
cheryl
perich
was
a
called
teacher
at
hosanna-tabor.
in
addition
to
teaching
secular
subjects
like
math
and
social
studies,
perich
taught
a
religion
class,
led
her
students
in
daily
prayer
and
devotional
exercises
and
took
her
students
to
a
weekly
school-wide
chapel
service.
lay
teachers
did
all
this
too
when
called
teachers
were
not
available.
now,
in
2004,
perich
was
diagnosed
with
narcolepsy
and
went
on
disability
leave.
when
she
thought
she'd
gotten
better,
she
--
she
sought
to
return
to
teaching,
but
the
church
said
it
no
longer
had
a
position
for
her
and
asked
her
to
resign.
after
perich
refused
and
showed
up
at
the
school
anyway,
she
was
told
she
would
likely
be
fired.
perich
responded
by
threatening
to
take
legal
action.
a
few
weeks
later,
the
church
did
fire
her,
citing
what
it
called
here
disruptive
behavior
and
at
that
point,
perich
did
take
legal
action.
she
filed
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
or
eeoc,
alleging
that
by
firing
her,
the
church
had
violated
a
federal
law,
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
or
ada.
the
eeoc
sued
the
church
under
the
ada,
claiming
that
the
church
had
unlawfully
retaliated
against
perich
for
threatening
legal
action,
and
perich
joined
that
suit.
invoking
what
is
known
as
the
ministerial
exception,
the
church
argues
that
the
employment
discrimination
suit
cannot
proceed.
it
contends
that
enforcing
the
ada
here
is
barred
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
because
such
a
suit
would
allow
the
government
to
intrude
into
the
employment
relationship
between
a
religious
group
and
one
of
its
ministers.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
such
a
ministerial
exception
exists.
now,
controversy
between
church
and
state
over
religious
offices
is
nothing
new.
in
fact,
the
issue
was
addressed
in
the
very
first
clause
of
magna
carta.
there,
king
john
agreed
and
this,
"the
english
church
shall
be
free"
and
he
accepted
the
church's
"freedom
of
elections,"
a
right
thought
to
be
of
the
greatest
necessity
and
importance.
that
freedom,
of
course,
did
not
survive
the
reign
of
henry
viii
and
in
1534
the
english
monarch
was
made
the
head
of
the
established
church
with
authority
to
appoint
its
high
officials.
many
in
england
later
left
for
america
precisely
so
that
they
could
choose
their
own
ministers
here.
even
colonists,
who
continued
to
follow
the
church
of
england
after
they
arrived,
often
objected
to
the
control
exercise
by
the
crown
over
religious
offices.
to
cite
just
one
example,
in
virginia,
there
was
a
law
that
vested
with
the
royal
governor,
the
power
to
appoint
ministers,
but
local
groups
often
defied
him
by
choosing
ministers
on
their
own.
it
was
against
this
background
that
our
nation
adopted
the
first
amendment
providing
that
congress
shall
make
no
laws
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof.
familiar
with
life
under
the
established
church
of
england,
the
founding
generations
sought
to
foreclose
the
possibility
of
a
national
church
by
forbidding
the
establishment
of
religion
and
guaranteeing
the
free
exercise
thereof.
the
amendment's
religion
clauses
ensured
that
the
new
federal
government,
unlike
the
english
crown,
would
have
no
role
in
filling
religious
offices.
now,
until
today,
we
have
not
had
occasion
to
consider
whether
this
core
principle
is
implicated
by
a
suit
that
alleges
discrimination
in
employment
and
seeks
the
help
of
the
government
in
resolving
that
employment
dispute.
we
conclude
that
the
ministerial
exception
is
implicated
in
such
a
situation.
the
members
of
a
religious
group
put
their
faith
in
the
hands
of
their
ministers.
requiring
a
church
to
accept
or
retain
an
unwanted
minister
or
punishing
a
church
for
failing
to
do
so,
intrudes
upon
more
than
a
mere
employment
decision.
such
action
interferes
with
the
internal
governance
of
the
church,
depriving
the
church
of
control
over
the
selection
of
those
who
will
personify
its
beliefs.
by
imposing
an
unwanted
minister
through
an
employment
discrimination
suit,
the
state
infringes
the
free
exercise
clause
which
protects
a
religious
group's
right
to
shape
its
own
faith
and
mission
through
its
appointments.
giving
the
state
the
power
to
determine
which
individuals
will
--
will
minister
to
the
faithful,
also
violates
the
establishment
clause
which
prohibits
government
involvement
in
such
ecclesiastical
decisions.
now,
having
concluded
that
there
is
a
ministerial
exception
grounded
in
the
religion
clauses,
the
next
question
is
whether
perich
was
a
minister.
given
all
the
circumstances
of
her
employment,
we
hold
that
she
was.
to
begin
with,
hosanna-tabor
held
perich
out
as
a
minister.
the
church
issued
her
a
"diploma
of
vocation"
formally
designating
her
a
"minister
of
religion".
that
title
represented
a
significant
degree
of
religious
training
followed
by
a
formal
process
of
commissioning.
perich
also
held
herself
out
as
a
minister
by
accepting
the
formal
call
to
religious
services
--
religious
service
and
even
claiming
a
special
housing
allowance
for
those
in
the
ministry.
finally,
perich's
job
duties
reflected
a
role
in
convening
the
church's
message
and
carrying
out
its
mission.
as
mentioned
earlier,
perich
taught
a
religion
class,
led
her
students
in
prayer
and
devotional
exercises,
and
took
her
students
to
a
weekly
school-wide
chapel
services.
about
twice
a
year,
she
led
the
chapel
service
herself,
choosing
the
liturgies,
selecting
the
hymns
and
delivering
a
short
message
based
on
verses
from
the
bible.
now,
it
is
true
that
these
duties
occupied
only
45
minutes
of
her
time
in
a
typical
school
day,
but
the
issue
before
us
is
not
one
that
can
be
resolved
by
a
stopwatch.
as
a
source
of
religious
instruction,
perich
played
an
important
part
in
transmitting
the
lutheran
faith
to
the
next
generation.
none
of
the
factors
i've
discussed
is
determinative,
but
together,
they
lead
us
to
conclude
that
perich
was
a
minister.
this
suit,
therefore,
must
be
dismissed.
an
order
reinstating
perich
at
the
school
would
plainly
violate
the
church's
freedom
under
the
religion
clauses
to
select
its
own
ministers,
so
too
would
an
award
of
pay,
damages
or
attorney's
fees
which
would
operate
as
a
penalty
on
the
church
for
terminating
an
unwanted
minister.
granting
perich
the
relief
she
seeks
would
entail
a
determination
that
hosanna-tabor
was
wrong
to
have
fired
here
and
it
is
precisely
such
a
ruling
that
is
barred
by
the
ministerial
exception.
the
interest
of
society
in
enforcing
employment
discrimination
laws
is
plainly
important,
but
so
too
is
the
interest
of
religious
groups
in
choosing
who
will
preach
their
beliefs,
teach
their
faith
and
carryout
their
mission.
when
a
minister,
who
has
been
fired,
sues
her
church,
alleging
that
her
termination
was
discriminatory,
the
first
amendment
has
struck
the
balance
for
us.
the
church
must
be
free
to
choose
those
who
will
guide
it
on
its
way.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
in
which
justice
kagan
joins.
