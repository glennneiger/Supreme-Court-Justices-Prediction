justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
here
what
we
have
is
a
claim
of
retaliation,
so
that
she
can't
even
get
a
hearing.
so
we
can
look
at
the
various
tests
that
are
proposed
here,
and
i
think
it's
difficult
to
formulate
the
tests,
but
this
can't
even
be
--
be
litigated
because
she
is
discharged.
the
allegation
is
that
there
is
a
retaliation
for
even
asking
for
a
hearing
where
these
tests
could
--
could
be
applied.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
that
--
that
could
be
an
argument
you
could
make
in
the
--
in
the
pretext
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
asking
for
an
exemption
so
these
issues
can't
even
be
tried.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
almost
like
a
summary
--
like
a
summary
judgment
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
analogy,
i
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
what
she
is
saying
is
that
you
basically
gave
me
summary
judgment;
you
didn't
allow
me
to
go
to
the
agency
to
have
a
proper
test
applied.
the
summary
judgment
was
just
an
analogy.
forget
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
saying
if
there
are
some
substantial
issues
the
church
has
that
can
be
litigated
in
eeoc
hearing.
she
was
fired
simply
for
asking
for
a
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
lay
people
in
many--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
answer
you
gave
to
the
chief
justice
seem
to
me
to
be
this
case.
i
was
interested.
i
didn't
know
about
this,
this
minister
capacity
in
this
particular
church.
and
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
many
churches
don't
have
--
some
churches
don't
have
what
we
think
of
as
professional
or
full-time
ministers
at
all.
they're
all
ministers.
and
you
said,
well,
that
--
that,
that
can
be
litigated,
that
can
be
investigated.
and
i
suppose
when
we
do
that
we
say,
how
many
secular
functions
do
you
perform?
and
that's
what
this
case
is.
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
even
want
that
issue
to
be
tried.
you
say
that
issue
can't
even
be
explored.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
while
justice
ginsburg
is
looking,
i
had
--
i
had
the
same
impression,
that
whether
you're
commissioned
or
not
commissioned
doesn't
necessarily
mean
you
can't
teach
a
religious
class.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
again,
that's
something
that,
that
can
be
heard.
you
don't
even
want
to
hear
it.
