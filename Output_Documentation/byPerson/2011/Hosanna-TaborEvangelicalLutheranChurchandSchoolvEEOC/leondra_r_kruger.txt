ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice
and
play
it
please
the
court:
the
freedom
of
religious
communities
to
come
together
to
express
and
share
religious
belief
is
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
but
it's
a
right
that
must
also
accommodate
important
governmental
interests
in
securing
the
public
welfare.
congress
has
not
unconstitutionally
infringed
petitioner's
freedom
in
this
case
by
making
it
illegal
for
it
to
fire
a
fourth
grade
teacher
in
retaliation
for
asserting
her
statutory
rights.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
ministerial
exception
is
understood
as
a
first
amendment
doctrine
that
governs
the
adjudication
of
disputes
between
certain
employees
and
their
employers,
we
agree
that
that
first
amendment
doctrine
exists.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
think
that
the
ministerial
exception
is
one
that
incorporates
the
right
of
association
as
well
as
the
rights
under
the
religion
clauses.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
think
that
the
--
the
analysis
is
one
that
the
court
has
--
has
elaborated
in
other
cases
involving
similar
claims
to
autonomy,
noninterference.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
think
the
basic
contours
of
the
inquiry
are
not
different.
we
think
how
the
inquiry
plays
out
in
particular
cases
may
be.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
the
contours
--
the
inquiry
that
the
court
has
set
out
as
to
expressive
associations
we
think
translate
quite
well
to
analyzing
the
claim
that
petitioner
has
made
here.
and
for
this
reason,
we
don't
think
that
the
job
duties
of
a
particular
religious
employee
in
an
organization
are
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
justice
scalia,
if
i
may,
i
don't
understand
petitioner
from
the
first
half
of
his
argument
to
have
disputed
this
basic
point,
which
is
that
the
contours
of
the
first
amendment
doctrine
at
issue
here
will
depend
on
a
balancing
of
interests.
that
is
the
only
way,
i
think,
that
petitioner
can
differentiate
a
generally
neutrally
applicable
application
of
antidiscrimination
law
with
respect
to
a
church's
choice
of
those
who
would
govern
it
and
a
church's
retaliation
against
a
teacher
who
would
report
child
abuse
to
the
authorities.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
justice
scalia--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--here
is
where
i
think
was
the
core
of
the
insight
of
the
ministerial
exception
as
it
was
originally
conceived
is,
which
is
that
there
are
certain
relationships
within
a
religious
community
that
are
so
fundamental,
so
private
and
ecclesiastical
in
nature,
that
it
will
take
an
extraordinarily
compelling
governmental
interest
to
just
interference.
concerns
with
health
or
safety,
for
example.
but
the
government's
general
interest
in
eradicating
discrimination
in
the
workplace
will
not
be
sufficient
to
justify
the
burden--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
justice
alito,
we
don't
dispute
it.
what
we
do
dispute
is
that
what
is
happening
when
the
government
applies
generally
applicable
anti-retaliation
law
to
a
religious
employer
is
that
it
is
choosing
a
minister
on
behalf
of
the
church.
what
it
is
instead
doing
is
preventing
religious
employers,
like
any
other
employers,
from
punishing
their
employees
for
threatening
to
bring
illegal
conduct
to
the
attention
of--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--justice
breyer--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--it's
not
protected.
i'd
like
to
--
i
think
there
are
two
responses
that
are
relevant
to
how
this
court
would
resolve
that
question
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
rule
that
petitioner
would
ask
it
to
adopt,
we
would
never
ask
the
question
whether
or
not
the
church
has
a
reason
for
firing
an
employee
that's
rooted
in
religious
doctrine.
their
submission
is
that
the
hiring
and
firing
decisions
with
respect
to
parochial
school
teachers
and
with
respect
to
priests
is
categorically
off
limits.
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
rule
that
is
insufficiently
attentive
to
the
relative
public
and
private
interests
at
stake,
interests
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
are
important
in
determining
freedom
of
association
claims.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
right.
we
think
that
the
--
both
the
private
and
public
interests
are
very
different
in
the
two
scenarios.
the
government's
general
interest
in
eradicating
discrimination
in
the
workplace
is
simply
not
sufficient
to
justify
changing
the
way
that
the
catholic
church
chooses
its
priests,
based
on
gender
roles
that
are
rooted
in
religious
doctrine.
but
the
interests
in
this
case
are
quite
different.
the
government
has
a
compelling
and
indeed
overriding
interest
in
ensuring
that
individuals
are
not
prevented
from
coming
to
the
government
with
information
about
illegal
conduct.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
no,
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
drawing
distinctions
between
the
importance
of
a
particular
religious
tenet
in
a
system
of
religious
belief.
but
the
difference
is
that
the
government
has
a
indeed
foundational
interest
in
ensuring,
as
a
matter
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
rule
of
law,
that
individuals
are
not
punished
for
coming--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
am
drawing
a
distinction
between--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--the
government's
interest
in
preventing
retaliation
against
those
who
would
go
to
civil
authorities
with
civil
wrongs
is
foundational
to
the
rule
of
law.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
there
is
an
important
distinction
to
be
made
between
the
government's
general
interest
in
eradicating
discrimination
from
the
workplace
and
the
government's
interest
in
ensuring
that
individuals
are
not
chilled
from
coming
to
civil
authorities
with
reports
about
civil
wrongs.
but
if
i
could
continue,
i
think
that
the--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
don't
think
that
those
are
the
only
two
sets
of
inquiries
that
are
important
in
the
balancing.
and
if
i
could
continue,
i
think
the
government--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
that
doesn't
--
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
in
part
because
that
doesn't
fully
account
for
all
of
the
public
and
private
interests
at
stake.
the
government's
interest
extends
in
this
case
beyond
the
fact
that
this
is
a
retaliation
to
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
church
operating
internally
to
promulgate
and
express
religious
belief
internally.
it
is
a
church
that
has
decided
to
open
its
doors
to
the
public
to
provide
the
service,
socially
beneficial
service,
of
educating
children
for
a
fee,
in
compliance
with
state
compulsory
education
laws.
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
like
bob
jones
that
church-operated
schools
sit
in
a
different
position
with
respect
to
the
--
the
permissible
scope
of
governmental
regulations,
the
churches
themselves
do.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
the
government--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--justice
scalia,
to
be
clear,
the
government's
interest
in
this
case
is
not
in
dictating
to
the
church-operated
school
who
it
may
choose
to
teach
religion
classes
and
who
it
may
not.
it
is
one
thing
and
one
thing
only,
which
is
to
tell
the
school
that
it
may
not
punish
its
employees
for
threatening
to
report
civil
wrongs
to
civil
authorities.
that
is
an
interest
that
we
think
overrides
the
burden
on
the
association's
religious
message
about
the
virtues
of
internal
dispute
resolution
as
opposed
to
court
resolution.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
no,
absolutely
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
do
not
dispute
--
when
they
assert
that
it's
an
important
tenet,
we
assume
its
validity,
we
assume
that
they
are
sincere
in
that
religious
belief.
but
just
as
in
united
states
v.
lee
a
sincere
religious
belief
was
not
sufficient
to
warrant
an
exemption
from
generally
applicable
tax
laws,
as
in
bob
jones,
or--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--yes.
but
that's
because
the
balance
of
relative
public
and
private
interests
is
different
in
each
case.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
don't
see
that
line
of
church
autonomy
principles
in
the
religion
clause
jurisprudence
as
such.
we
see
it
as
a
question
of
freedom
of
association.
we
think
that
this
case
is
perhaps
one
of
the
cases--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--we
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
cases
that
employment
division
v.
smith
may
have
been
referring
to
when
it
referred
to
free
association
claims
that
are
reinforced
by
free
exercise
concerns.
it's
certainly
true
that
the
association's
claim
to
autonomy
in
this
case
is
one
that
is
deeply
rooted;
and
concerns
about
how
it
exercises
its
religion,
those
two
things
merge
in
some
ways
in
that
respect.
but--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
the
answer
is
no,
justice
scalia--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--but
that
is--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
would
begin
with
looking
at
the
burdens
on
association
under
the
balancing
test.
i
think
that
the
core
of
the
understanding
of
the
ministerial
exception
as
it
was
elaborated
in
the
lower
courts
is
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
governmental
regulation
that
operates
to
interfere
with
the
relationship
between
a
church
and
those
who
would
govern
it,
those
who
would
preach
the
word
to
the
congregation,
those
who
would
administer
its
sacraments,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
more
public
relationship
between
a
church
and
a
school
teacher
and
others
that
provide
services
to
the
public
at
large.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
the
importance
of
either
function
to
the
--
the
religious
association.
it's
a
question
of
the
realm
of
permissible
governmental
regulation.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
that
is
a
perfectly
appropriate
way
to
come
at
this
case,
although
it
skips
over
sort
of
the
initial
inquiry,
which
is
into
whether
or
not
the
application
of
the
regulations
to
the
particular
employment
relationship
results
in
an
unwarranted
interference.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
breyer.
and
i
think
the
next
question
becomes,
with
respect
to
adjudicating
a
particular
case,
whether
deciding
the
case
would
require
the
court
to
decide
disputed
matters
of
religious
doctrine
or
to
second-guess
essentially
subjective--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
it's
not
how
it
would
play
out.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
any
inquiry
into
the
validity
of
a
particular
religious
doctrine
is
simply
irrelevant
to
the
adjudication
of
the
dispute,
which
is
designed
to
find
out
just
one
thing,
which
is
whether
the--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--if
the
only
way
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
that
may
not
have
been
the
employer's
real
reason
was
a
subjective
judgment
about
the
quality
of
canon
law
scholarship,
then
judgment
has
to
be
entered
for
the
employer,
because
the
plaintiff
has
no
viable
way,
consistent
with
the
establishment
cause,
of
demonstrating
that
wasn't
the
employer's
real
reason.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
plaintiff
has
evidence
that
no
one
ever
raised
any
objections
to
the
quality
of
her
scholarship,
but
they
raised
objections
to
women
serving
in
certain
roles
in
the
school,
and
those
roles
were
not
ones
that
were
required
to
be
filled
by
persons
of
a
particular
gender,
consistent
with
religious
beliefs,
then
that's
a
case
in
which
a
judge
can
instruct
a
jury
that
it's
job
is
not
to
inquire
as
to
the
validity
of
the
subjective
judgment,
just
as
juries
are
often
instructed
that
their
job
is
not
to
determine
whether
an
employer's
business
judgment
was
fair
or
correct,
but
only
whether
the
employer
was
motivated
by
discrimination
or
retaliation.
