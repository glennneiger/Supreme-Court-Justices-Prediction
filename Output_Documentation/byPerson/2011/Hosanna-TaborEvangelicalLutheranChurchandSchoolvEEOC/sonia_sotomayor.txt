counsel,
most
of
the
circuits
have
recognized
a
ministerial
exception.
but
they've
in
one
form
or
another
created
a
pretext
exception.
the
reason
for
that
is
the
situation
that
troubles
me.
how
about
a
teacher
who
reports
sexual
abuse
to
the
government
and
is
fired
because
of
that
reporting?
now,
we
know
from
the
news
recently
that
there
was
a
church
whose
religious
beliefs
centered
around
sexually
exploiting
women
and
i
believe
children.
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
religious
belief
or
not,
doesn't
society
have
a
right
at
some
point
to
say
certain
conduct
is
unacceptable,
even
if
religious
--
smoking
peyote?
and
once
we
say
that's
unacceptable,
can
and
why
shouldn't
we
protect
the
people
who
are
doing
what
the
law
requires,
i.e.
reporting
it?
so
how
do
we
deal
with
that
situation
under
your
theory?
under
your
theory,
nothing
survives
if
the
individual
is
a
minister,
no
claim,
private
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
with
that
is
that
it
doesn't
take
account
of
the
societal
interest
in
encouraging
the
reporting.
and
in
fact,
if
we
--
if
we
define
the
ministerial
exception
in
the
way
you
want,
we
take
away
the
incentive
for
reporting;
we
actually
do
the
opposite
of
what
society
needs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how?
give
me
a
theoretical
framework
for
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
going
back
to
the
question
justice
kagan
asked
you,
if
one
of
these
protestant
teachers
that's
not
lutheran
led
the
cafeteria
prayer,
as
they
are
required
to,
you're
now
saying
that
the
law
must
recognize
that
lay
teacher
as
a
minister
and
apply
the
ministerial
exception,
even
though
the
religion
doesn't
consider
her
a
minister?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
that
was
the
answer
you
gave.
if
she
taught
a
religious
class--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
is
your
definition
of
minister?
maybe
we
need
to
find
out.
so
it's
not
a
title.
it's
really
--
the
only
function,
you're
saying
anyone
who
teaches
religion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
laycock,
i'm
not
sure
why
the
status
of
the
individual
matters
under
your
theory.
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is,
so
long
as
a
religious
organization
gives
a
religious
reason
of
any
kind,
genuine
or
not,
for
firing
someone
that's
associated
with
it,
whether
minister
or
not,
that
that
invokes
the
exception.
am
i
hearing
your
argument
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
why
is
there
a
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
would
say
with
janitors,
you
can
get
into
the
pretext
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
limiting
your
test
to
whether
that
person
is
minister.
so
define
minister
for
me
again.
