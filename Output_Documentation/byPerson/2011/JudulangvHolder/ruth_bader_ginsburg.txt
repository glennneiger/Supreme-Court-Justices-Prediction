and
the
violent
felony
--
the
violent
felony
in
this
case,
he
had
a
suspended
sentence,
didn't
he?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
change
is
a
sharp
change.
i
think
this
is
a
very
confusing
set
of
decisions.
and
the
wadud
case
that
was
brought
up
before
has
a
footnote
that
says
that
the
board
had
stated
a
waiver
of
inadmissibility
may
be
granted
in
deportation
if
the
alien
was
excludable
as
a
result
of
the
same
facts.
and
then
that
footnote
ends
"we
shall
withdraw
from
that
language
in
each
of
these
cases.
"
justice

bader

what
about
the
comparability
of
the
crime
involved
as
it
says
here
that
was
a
drug
offense.
does
the
inadmissibility
criterion,
does
that
accord
with
the
one
for
deportation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
ending
with
the
comparison
works,
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
aggravated
felony
crime
of
violence
that
is
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
judulang's
crime
a
crime
involving
violence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
what
your
position
means
that
it's
up
to
the
agency
--
up
to
the
person
who
makes
the
charge.
because
take
mr.
judulang,
he
could
have
been
categorized
as
deportable
because
he
committed
a
crime
in
--
involving
moral
turpitude,
or
he
could
have
been
categorized
as
somebody
who
committed
an
aggravated
felony.
it
is
then
totally
in
the
hands
of
the
person
who
is
making
the
charge
whether
there
will
be
a
match
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
--
if
the
officer
labels
the
manslaughter
in
this
case
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
then
there
is
a
match--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
he
labels
it
aggravated
felony,
crime
of
violence,
then
there
is
no
match.
so
it's
up
to
the
charger
whether
there
will
be
this
match
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
--
then
you
have
to
say
yes,
you
can
have
somebody
who
would
get
a
waiver
of
inadmissibility
for
a
crime,
and
the
very
next
day
be
put
in
deportation
without
any
waiver
for
that
same
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
these
categories--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--these
categories.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
yet
in
your
brief,
i
thought
you
conceded
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
--
just
the
example
that
justice
sotomayor
gave.
somebody
is
declared
inadmissible
because
it's
a
crime
with
manslaughter
or
aggravated
felony
crime
of
violence
is
on
the
admissibility
side
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
so
he's
allowed
in.
and
then
he's
in
and
he's
declared
deportable
and
he
can't
get
a
waiver
because
there's
no
analogue.
i
thought
your
brief
said
yes,
that's
the
consequence
of
our
argument;
however,
prosecutors
would
not
seek
deportation
if
inadmissibility
had
been
waived.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
also
said
that
there
are
only
two
grounds
for
deportation
that
have
no
analog
in
the
grounds
for
exclusion.
