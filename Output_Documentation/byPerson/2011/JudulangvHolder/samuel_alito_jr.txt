now,
if
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
lesser
offense
that
was
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
he
would
not
be
eligible
for
the
waiver,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
strange?
suppose
you
have
somebody
who
is
charged
with
a
lesser
offense
that
--
that
doesn't
involve
moral
turpitude
and
a
greater
offense
that
does,
and
the
defense
attorney
comes
to
the
client
and
says:
i
have
got
great
news;
the
prosecutor
will
take
a
plea
to
the
lesser
offense
and
drop
the
greater
one.
i
guess
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
bad,
potentially
bad
advice,
because
he
ought
to
plead
to
the
more
serious
offense
because
then
he
would
be
eligible
for
a
waiver.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
is
so
bizarre,
it
makes
me
--
he
is
pleading
to
prove
that
what
he
did
was
really
turpitudinous.
it
makes
me
think
that
maybe
the
en
banc
ninth
circuit
was
right,
that
this
whole
line
of
cases
has
gone
off
along
the
wrong
track
quite
a
while
ago.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
know
how
potentially
how
many
people
may
be
affected
by
the
decision
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
know
how
many
times
this
has
come
up
in
cases
over,
let's
say
the
past
5
years?
