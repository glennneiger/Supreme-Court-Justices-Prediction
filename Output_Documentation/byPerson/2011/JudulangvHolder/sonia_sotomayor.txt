but
you're
not
--
you're
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
what
you
just
said
made
logical
sense;
the
category
of
gun
possession
doesn't
go
in.
visa
fraud
doesn't
become
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
but
we
have
cases
that
have
said
generically,
manslaughter
which
involves
violence
is
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
others
have
qualified
sexual
abuse
of
a
minor.
i
don't
know
of
anyone
who
would
think
that
that
category
of
crimes,
whether
you
call
it
indecency,
touching
or
--
we've
already
said
touching
alone
may
not
qualify
--
but
my
point
is,
you
now
are
saying,
i
think,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
aggravated
violent
felons
is
an
entire
category,
and
anything
that
falls
under
that
label
can't
be
a
grounds
of
exclusion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
how
i
read
your
categorical
comparison,
though.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
why
is
manslaughter
not
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
keep
going
back
to
my
question.
there's
only
one
category
now,
aggravated
violent
felony.
that's
the
only
category
you
are
looking
at.
it
doesn't
matter,
in
your
judgment.
that
--
that
is
your
test.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
it
qualifies
as
an
aggravated
violent
felony,
it
cannot
be
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
go
back
to
a
concrete
example
following
justice
ginsburg's
example.
someone
is
charged
with
a
crime
of
violence,
voluntary
manslaughter.
and
would
an
officer
at
the
airport
say
you're
not
admittable;
that's
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude?
could
the
officer
say
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
could
he
then
waive
that
ground
under
212(c)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
let's
assume
that
he
did,
that
he
waives
that
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
would
the
government
now
put
that
individual
in
deportation
and
say
this
voluntary
manslaughter
doesn't
meet
the
statutory
counterpart
test.
so
for
that
very
crime,
we
are
going
to
deport
you,
even
though
we
let
you
in,
because
it's
a
crime
involving
violence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you?
can
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
where
your
test
leads
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
just
a
practical
question?
does
this
issue
go
away
finally
when
there
are
no
more
st.
cyr
people?
meaning
is
there
--
there
is
no
212(c)
anymore.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
really
the
issue
that
we
have
at
the
moment
is
whether
your
decision
to
effect
what
has
happened
now
in
the
past,
to
do
what
congress
has
done
moving
forward,
and
to
avoid
st.
cyr,
is
just
to
say,
if
it's
an
aggravated
crime
of
violence
it
just
doesn't
qualify
anymore.
that's
what
you
are
doing.
you're
not
giving
212(c)
to
anybody
anymore?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
were
just
saying
if
they
are
aggravated
--
if
they've
committed
an
aggravated
crime
of
violence
they
are
not
getting
it
anymore.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
whole
thing
goes
away
once
all
the
st.
cyr
people
have--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
they
weren't
law-abiding,
they
would
have
committed
a
new
felony
that
would
render
them
inadmissible--
