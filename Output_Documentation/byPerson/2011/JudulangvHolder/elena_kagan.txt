mr.--
justice
elena
kagan
--please
finish.
justice
elena
kagan
you
cite
some
cases.
you
say
there
was
a
dramatic
change
in
the
law.
the
government
cites
some
cases
and
it
says
there
was
no
change
in
the
law.
what
if
the
truth
lies
someplace
in
the
middle.
what
if,
in
fact,
when
you
look
before
blake
what
you
see
is
some
amount
of
confusion;
that
the
board
sometimes
was
following
the
blake
rule,
but
that
at
other
times
individual
judges
or
maybe
the
board
itself
were
doing
something
different,
because
the
individual
circumstances
suggested
that
they
should,
or
just
because
they
weren't
so
clear
on
the
difference
between
these
two
approaches.
and
then
blake
comes
along,
and
what
blake
does
is
neither
to
change
something
dramatically
nor
to
just
reaffirm
what
was
there,
but
in
some
sense
to
create
a
little
bit
of
order
out
of
chaos.
what
would
that
do
to
your
argument
if
that's
the
way
one
understood
blake?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fleming,
the
government
says
that
it
has
an
interest
in
treating
people
in
deportation
proceedings
less
favorable,
if
you
will,
than
people
in
exclusion
proceedings.
do
you
dispute
that
broad
premise
that
the
government
could
develop
a
system
which
treated
those
two
groups
differently?
justice
elena
kagan
the
government
says
that
is
not
the
case.
the
government
says
that
it
does
not
treat
those
two
groups
differently.
do
you
have
evidence
to
the
contrary?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
gannon,
suppose
this.
suppose
that
on
the
exclusion
side,
you
have
this
category
of
crimes
of
moral
turpitude,
and
suppose
in
the
deportation
side
--
which
i
think
is
right,
you
have
a
category
called
crimes
of
violence,
and
you
also
have
a
category
called
crimes
of
moral
turpitude.
there
is
a
time
limit
on
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--that's
right.
suppose
that
you
--
the
government
could
have
slotted
manslaughter
into
either
of
those
categories
on
the
deportation
side,
and
i
understand
that
there
is
a
dispute
about
whether
it
could
have,
but
let's
suppose
it
could
have.
so
if
manslaughter
is
categorized
on
the
deportation
side
as
a
crime
of
violence,
you
say
it
doesn't
match
with
the
category
on
the
exclusion
side.
but
if
the
same
crime
is
categorized
in
a
different
way
by
the
government,
then
it
does
match
on
the
exclusion
side.
so
what
sense
does
that
make,
the
government's
decision
about
how
to
categorize
a
--
a
given
offense
on
the
deportation
side
is
going
to
determine
whether
a
person
gets
relief?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
petitioner
--
the
petitioner
just
says
we
look
to
manslaughter,
and
we
ask
whether
that
qualifies
a
person
for
relief
on
the
exclusion
side--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
you
are
saying
no,
first,
we
have
to
put
manslaughter
in
a
category
on
the
deportation
side,
and
then
we
have
to
match
that
to
the
category
on
the
exclusion
side.
and
what
i'm
asking
you
is
kind
of
what
sense
does
that
make?
doesn't
everything
depend
on
which
category
you
put
manslaughter
into?
justice
elena
kagan
you
are
so
far
from
the
statute,
mr.
gannon,
you
can't
even
tell
what's
closer
to
the
statute.
i
mean,
you
are
miles
away
from
the
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
isn't
a
question
about
the
history,
mr.
gannon.
even
if
we
assume
that
you
are
right
about
the
history,
this
is
a
question
about
whether
this
is
an
arbitrary
system,
and
where
you
are
devising
it
from
and
what
lies
behind
with
it.
justice
elena
kagan
you
said,
mr.
gannon,
the
government
no
longer
treats
people
differently
depending
on
whether
they
left
the
country
and
returned
or
haven't
left
at
all.
mr.
fleming
points
out
that
you
said
the
opposite
in
your
brief
opposing
cert.
he
said
that--
justice
elena
kagan
petitioner
in
this
case
is
joe
judulang,
a
native
of
the
philippines
who
has
lived
in
this
country
for
many
years
as
a
lawful
resident
alien.
recently,
the
government
sought
to
deport
judulang
based
on
a
manslaughter
conviction
occurring
in
1988.
judulang
tried
to
apply
to
the
attorney
general
for
what's
called
relief
from
deportation,
essentially,
a
waiver
of
the
deportation
law
that
would
allow
him
to
stay
in
this
country.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
i'm
going
to
call
it
the
bia,
ruled
that
judulang
was
not
eligible
to
seek
a
waiver.
in
this
case,
we've
reviewed
the
bia's
policy
for
deciding
when
resident
aliens
like
judulang
may
seek
relief
from
deportation
under
former
section
212(c)
of
the
immigration
laws.
today,
we
hold
that
the
bia's
policy
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
legal
background
of
this
case,
as
you
will
see,
is
complicated,
but
the
principle
governing
our
decision
is
anything
but,
when
an
administrative
agency
sets
policy,
it
must
provide
reasons,
an
explanation
for
its
action
that
makes
at
least
a
modicum
of
sense.
that's
not
a
high
bar,
but
it
is
an
important
one.
and
here,
the
bia
failed
to
meet
it.
now,
the
bia
policy
here
rests
on
a
distinction
that
the
immigration
laws
draw
between
exclusion
and
deportation.
an
exclusion
case
involves
an
alien
trying
to
gain
entry
to
this
country.
a
deportation
case
involves
an
alien
already
in
the
country
whom
the
government
is
trying
to
remove.
the
immigration
laws
provide
one
list
of
reasons
for
excluding
an
alien
and
a
separate
list
for
deporting
an
alien.
the
statute
calls
these
reasons
grounds
and
many
of
the
grounds
focus
on
prior
criminal
convictions.
so
for
example,
one
ground
for
excluding
an
alien
is
that
the
alien
has
previously
committed
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
well,
one
ground
for
deporting
an
alien
is
that
he
has
committed
what's
called
an
aggravated
felony
involving
a
crime
of
violence.
section
212(c)
is
the
key
statutory
provision
in
this
case.congress
repealed
that
provision
in
1996,
but
it
continues
to
apply
when
an
immigration
action
is
based
on
a
guilty
plea
entered
before
that
year,
as
judulang's
was.
under
section
212(c),
the
attorney
general
had
broad
power
to
permit
the
entry
of
aliens
who
could
have
been
excluded
from
this
country.
the
provision
was
silent
about
whether
the
attorney
general
had
similar
power
to
waive
the
immigration
law
in
deportation
cases.
but
over
time,
the
bia
decided
that
section
212(c)
should
sometimes
apply
in
those
cases,
as
well.
this
case
concerns
the
bia's
method
for
deciding
when
that
is
so,
when
a
deportable
alien
is
eligible
for
relief
under
section
212(c)
or
to
say
that
another
way,
when
the
attorney
general
may
waive
the
deportation
law
and
allow
the
alien
to
stay
in
this
country.
the
bia's
approach
is
called
the
comparable-grounds
rule
and
it's
the
thing
that
we
review
and
that
we
invalidate
in
this
case.
under
the
comparable-grounds
rule,
the
bia
first
looks
to
the
ground
of
deportation
charged.
so
here,
judulang
was
charged
with
what
was
called
an
“aggravated
felony
involved
in
a
crime
of
violence.”
then
the
bia
asks
whether
that
ground
has
an
analog
in
the
exclusion
context.
in
other
words,
is
there
an
exclusion
ground
that
covers
the
same
set
of
criminal
offenses,
neither
more,
nor
less,
nor
different?
if
there's
no
matching
ground,
the
alien
is
ineligible
for
a
waiver
from
deportation.
so
here,
judulang
could
not
apply
for
relief
because
the
crime
of
violence,
deportation
ground
with
which
he
was
charged,
has
no
analog
in
the
list
of
exclusion
grounds.
now,
in
an
exclusion
case,
an
alien
with
a
manslaughter
conviction
would
be
eligible
for
section
212(c)
relief
because
that
crime
would
have
fallen
within
the
ground
for
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
but
according
to
the
bia,
the
moral
turpitude
exclusion
ground
does
not
correspond
to
the
crime
of
violence
deportation
ground.
although
both
grounds
include
manslaughter
which
was
judulang's
crime,
each
includes
some
criminal
offenses
that
the
other
does
not
and
so
judulang
was
out
of
luck.
now,
i'm
looking
into
the
courtroom
right
now
and
i'm
seeing
some
confused
faces.
but
if
the
comparable
grounds
rule
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
you,
not
to
worry
because
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
us
either,
and
that's
the
point
of
our
decision
today.
it's
why
we
hold
that
the
rule
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
problem
here
is
that
we
can
find
no
good
explanation
for
the
comparable-grounds
rule.
under
the
bia's
approach,
an
alien's
eligibility
for
a
waiver
does
not
turn
on
the
seriousness
of
his
prior
crime,
neither
does
it
turn
on
the
length
of
the
alien's
residence
in
this
country
or
on
any
other
circumstance
of
his
case.
instead,
the
alien's
eligibility
hinges
on
the
chance
correspondence
between
disconnected
statutory
categories,
but
that
matter
is
irrelevant
to
an
alien's
fitness
to
reside
in
this
country
and
because
that
is
so,
it
cannot
form
the
basis
of
a
deportation
decision.
we
detail
in
our
opinion
why
the
government's
various
attempts
to
justify
the
comparable-grounds
policy
do
not
succeed,
but
the
long
and
short
of
it
is,
that
we
think
the
bia's
policy
is
essentially
random,
almost
as
if
an
alien's
eligibility
for
relief
depended
on
a
coin
flip.
when
we
cannot
discern
a
reason
for
an
agency
policy,
we
cannot
uphold
it.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
approved
the
bia's
use
of
the
comparable-grounds
rule.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
