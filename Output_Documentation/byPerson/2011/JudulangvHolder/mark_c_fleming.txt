mr.
mark
c.
fleming
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
hernandez-casillas,
the
attorney
general
confirmed
that
a
lawful
permanent
resident
subject
to
deportation,
quote,
"must
have
the
same
opportunity
to
seek
discretionary
relief
as
an
alien
who
has
temporarily
left
this
country
and
upon
reentry
been
subject
to
exclusion.
"
2
months
later
in
its
published
decision
in
matter
of
meza,
the
bia
again
confirmed
that
an
immigrant
deportable
for
an
aggravated
felony
could
seek
relief
because
his
conviction
could
also
form
the
basis
for
excludability.
immigrants
in
situations
indistinguishable
from
mr.
judulang's
applied
for
and
received
relief
under
this
rule.
the
bia's
decision
in
blake
changed
the
law.
without
explaining
or
even
initially
acknowledging
that
it
was
doing
so,
the
blake
rule
was
impermissibly
retroactive,
and
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
on
its
own
merits.
we
would
submit
the
evidence--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--two
responses
to
that,
justice
scalia.
i
agree,
matter
of
wadud
is
the
principal
response
that
the
government
has,
and
it
does
not
help
them
at
all.
wadud
was
deportable
for
a
conviction
under
18
u.s.c.
1546,
and
the
bia
had
held
in
a
case
called
matter
of
rg
in
1958
that
that
conviction
did
not
render
him
excludable.
and
that
is
confirmed
later
in
the
case
of
matter
of
jimenez-santillano,
which
also
involved
a
1546
conviction,
where
the
bia
says
that
if
mr.
jimenez
had
left
of
the
country
and
returned
it
appears
that
he
would
not
have
been
inadmissible
and
compares
that
situation
to
someone
convicted
of
a
firearms
offense,
which
the
board
and
the
attorney
general
had
always
said
were
not
waivable.
to
the
extent
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
the
language
that
your
honor
read,
it
could
not
have
survived
the
attorney
general's
decision
in
hernandez-casillas,
which
i
just
quoted
at
the
beginning
of
the
presentation,
which
said
that
what
one
looks
to
is
whether
alien
in
exclusion
proceedings
would
be
able
to
invoke
section
212(c)
relief.
and
when
the
board
then
addressed
the
case
of
the
aggravated
felony
in
matter
of
meza,
it
did
not
even
address
wadud
or
view
it
as
binding
at
all.
it
looked
to
the
conviction
and
whether
it
formed
a
basis
for
excludability.
and
the
bia
then
followed
up
with
no
fewer
than
eight
decisions
in
crime
of
violence
cases
indistinguishable
from
this
case
where
the
bia
cited,
not
wadud,
not
any
of
the
other
cases
that
the
government
is
relying
on,
but
cited
meza
as
articulating
the
doctrine
that
the
focus
of
analysis
is
on
the
conviction.
and
the
court
has
the
briefs
of
several
former
immigration
officials,
including
two
ins
general
counsel
and
several
ins
trial
attorneys,
confirming
that
that
was
the
position
and
the
basis
on
which
the
government
litigated
these
cases--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--and
in
fact
--
yes,
justice
kagan?
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
if
i
may,
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
a
number
of
these
cases,
crime
of
violence
cases,
reached
the
merits
in
both
the
bia
and
the
courts
of
appeals
without
the
government
even
suggesting
that
there
was
a
statutory
counterpart
problem.
in
fact,
when
it
has
suited
its
purposes
the
government
and
the
bia
have
admitted
that
blake
was
a
change,
including
in
a
brief
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit
less
than
a
year
ago.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
obviously,
justice
kagan,
we
don't
think
that
is
the
proper
way
to
understand
blake.
but
to
answer
the
question,
for
purposes
of
the
retroactivity
analysis,
the
court
uses
what
the
court
in
st.
cyr
called
"considerations
of
fair
notice,
reasonable
reliance,
and
settled
expectations.
"
and
we
would
submit
that
reliance
was
more
than
reasonable
and
expectations
more
than
settled
as
to
how
the
board
was
addressing
crime
of
violence
aggravated
felony
convictions
prior
to
blake,
as
is
shown
by
the
evidence
that
i
cited
a
minute
ago,
namely
the
position
that
the
government
itself
was
taking
in
these
cases
and
the
way
that
immigrants
would
have
been
advised
by
both
criminal
defense
counsel
and
immigration
counsel,
including,
for
that
matter,
ins
trial
counsel.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i
don't
accept
the
premise
at
all,
justice
scalia,
that
the
law
was
confused.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
but
even
if
--
even
if
there
was
some
lack
of
clarity
in
the
law,
and
we
don't
think
there
was,
i
think
the
record
in
this
--
before
the
court
is
very
clear,
that
people
were
advised
by
competent
counsel
and
that
the
government
itself
took
the
same
position
in
front
of
the
immigration
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
that
someone
with
a
crime
of
violence
aggravated
felony
conviction
could
seek
relief
because
that
conviction
would
make
him
or
her
excludable
and
the
availability
of
relief
in
deportation
proceedings
is
meant
to
be
the
same
as
it
would
be
in
exclusion
proceedings.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
the
reasonable
expectation
that
once
someone
pleads
guilty,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
an
excludable
offense,
one
that
would
be
waivable
in
exclusion
proceedings,
that
a
waiver
may
be
sought
in
subsequent
deportation
proceedings
on
exactly
the
same
basis.
and
that
is
the
published
policy
of
the
bia.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes,
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
ruling
in
st.
cyr,
that
when
someone
--
when
someone
pleads
guilty
to
an
offense
that
is
eligible
for
relief
under
212(c)
there
is
reliability
on
the
possibility
--
not
a
guarantee
of
a
waiver,
obviously,
but
the
avoidance
of
mandatory
deportation,
appealing
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
quite
frequently,
i
think.
the
court
pointed
out
in
st.
cyr
that
they
are
frequent
and
now,
because
the
category
of
people
who
are
eligible
involves
people
who
have
very
old
convictions,
they
necessarily
pled
before
1996,
they
are
usually
minor
offenses,
they
involve
people
who
have
been
in
this
country
for
a
long
time,
they
frequently
have
property,
they
have
families,
they
can
show
rehabilitation.
often
they
only
come
to
the
attention
of
the
immigration
authorities
by
applying
for
naturalization
or
by
renewing
their
green
cards,
and
they
get
thrown
into
deportation
on
the
basis
of
these
old
convictions
that
at
the
time
of
the
plea
would
have
been
eligible
for
at
waiver,
and
it
is
simply
unfair
to
change
the
law,
as
blake
did,
and
impose
that
change
on
people
who
relied
on
it
in
pleading
guilty.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
on
the
contrary,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
in
st.
cyr
made
very
clear
that's
a
very
likely
situation.
it
cited
a
couple
of
cases
at
that
time
that
specifically
involved
that
colloquy.
the
nijc
amicus
brief
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
identifies
a
couple
of
situations,
including
the
case
of
mr.
ronald
bennett,
who
was
advised
by
his
lawyer
that
when
he
pled
guilty
it
would
not
be
a
problem
for
him
for
his
immigration
status
because
he
could
seek
212(c)
protection.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i
--
i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
quite
significant
for
people
whose
ability
to
stay
in
this
country
is
highly
important
to
them.
they
have
family
here,
they
have
lived
here
for
decades.
the
risk
that
they
are
going
to
be--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--he
was
sentenced
to
--
to
time
served
essentially
for
this
conviction,
that's
right.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that
--
if
--
if
the
offense
would
not
have
been
waivable
in
the
exclusion
proceedings,
he
would
not
be
eligible,
that's
correct,
justice
alito.
but
there
might
be
other
forms
of
relief
that
he--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--he
would
be
eligible
for
a
waiver
under
section
212(c),
justice
alito,
but
that
is
not
the
only
form
of
relief
that
someone
who
pleads
guilty
to
a
--
a
crime
could
potentially
seek.
and
people
who
plead
to
non-inadmissible
offenses,
offenses
that
do
not
lead
to
their
exclusion,
had
other
avenues
at
the
time
that
they
could
have
pursued.
for
instance,
they
could
have
pursued
adjustment
of
status.
that
is
the
--
the
bia's
decision
in
matter
of
gabryelsky.
in
order
to
adjust
status,
all
that
matters
is
that
you
not
be
inadmissible
to
the
country.
and
even
if
you
are
inadmissible,
you
can
seek
a
212(c)
waiver
during
that
process.
whether
you
are
deportable
or
not
doesn't
matter.
so
there
are
many
other
ways.
looking
at
section
212(c)
on
its
own,
it
might
appear
anomalous.
but
looking
at
the
immigration
law
as
it
was
before
1996,
there
are
other
options.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
maybe
i
wasn't
clear.
the
people
who
could
get
the
other
relief
are
people
who
pled
guilty
to
crimes
that
do
not
involve
moral
turpitude,
which
was
justice
alito's
hypothetical.
but
people
who
plead
to
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
potentially
don't
have
that
--
that
avenue
open
to
them.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
for
them,
section
212(c)
is
very
important
and
they
could
rely
on
its
availability,
and
did.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i
don't
know
which
category
your
honor
is
thinking
of.
but
certainly
you
can
plead
guilty
to
a
crime
that
does
not
involve
moral
turpitude;
then
you
would
not
be
eligible
for
212(c)
relief;
but
there
might
be
some
other
way
that
you
can
--
that
you
can
get
at
it.
but
that
is
not
this
category
of
people.
the
category
of
people
at
issue
here
are
people
who
pled
before
1996
to
aggravated
felony
crimes
of
violence,
almost
all
of
which,
if
not
all
of
which,
are
going
to
be
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
that
are
excludable
and
therefore
eligible
for
a
waiver.
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
they
will
get
it;
but
it
at
least
means
they
have
the
right
to
ask
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
his
discretion.
and
i
submit
that,
as
this
court
indicated
in
st.
cyr,
the
private
interest
in
avoiding
mandatory
deportation
is
very
strong.
we
have
what
i
believe
is
a
sudden
and
abrupt
change
in
the
law
in
blake;
and
it
could
not
have
been
foreseen,
in
fact
it
wasn't
foreseen
by
advocates
on
both
sides
of
the
"v"
in
these
cases.
the
remaining
question
for
purposes
of
the
retroactivity
analysis
is
only
the
strength
of
the
agency's
interest
in
applying
the
rule
retroactively.
i
submit
that
that
interest
here
is
no
stronger
than
it
is
in
the
ordinary
mine
run
of
cases,
and
in
fact
it
is
weaker,
because
all
that
we
are
talking
about
is
the
opportunity
to
submit
an
application
for
adjudication
on
the
merits,
which
is
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
mr.
judulang
would
have
the
burden
of
convincing
an
immigration
judge
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
he
deserves
relief
in
the
exercise
of
discretion.
and
so
under
chinnery--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
operative
language
there
is
"as
a
result
of
the
same
facts.
"
what
wadud
was
arguing
was
that
recognizing
that
his
conviction
would
not
make
him
excludable,
because
it
was
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
he
said
nonetheless
he
should
look
to
the
facts
of
my
conduct,
because
what
i
did
was
so
turpitudinous
that
the
government
would
surely
have
charged
me
as
excludable.
and
the
board
said:
we
are
not
going
to
do
that,
and
to
the
extent
our
prior
decision
suggested
that
we
are
withdrawing
from
that
language.
it
did
not
say,
however,
that
the
board
would
not
look
to
convictions
to
determine
excludability,
and
in
fact
in
meza
which
was
after
wadud
it
did
just
that.
and
when
the
court
came
to
crime
of
violence
cases
subsequently
to
that,
the
precedent
that
it
relied
on
was
meza,
which
focuses
on
the
conviction.
i
agree
it
does
not
focus
on
the
facts,
but
i
don't
think
the
language
that
your
honor
read
undermines
our
position
at
all.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
so
--
i
mean
the
notion
that
this
form
of
relief
is
available
in
deportation
proceedings
is
long
settled.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
it's
the
premise
of
this
court's
decision
in
st.
cyr.
the
agency
has
never
undermined
it
or
suggested
that
it
was
going
to
retreat
from
it.
no
party
before
this
court
is
suggesting
that
st.
cyr
should
have
been
overruled
on
that
basis,
so
i
--
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
congress,
after
the
relief
had
been
extended
to
deportation
proceedings,
enacted
provisions
in
1990
and
1996
that
would
have
no
operative
effect
if
relief
was
not
available
in
deportation
proceedings.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
there
--
there
are
two
responses
to
that,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
is
the
agency
has
accepted
that
in
matter
of
silva
as
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
35
years
now,
approximately,
and
congress
has
never
suggested
any
disapproval
of
it.
rather,
on
the
contrary
it
has
assumed
that
that
is
the
law,
and
that's
after
the
solicitor
general
refused
to
seek
certiorari
of
that
decision.
the
comparison
also
was
not
between
people
in
exclusion
and
people
in
deportation.
it
was
between
two--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
congress
at
this
point
has
not
only
acquiesced,
but
indicated
its
understanding
of
the
--
of
the
way
the
agency
has
applied
the
law.
and
honestly
i
think
this
is
a
--
a
question
for
the
government,
because
the
agency
has
never
suggested
that
there
was
any
basis
for
retreating
from
that
position
at
this
late
date.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
on
retroactivity,
i
would
move
quickly
to
our
substantive
position,
which
is
that
even
without
regard
to
retroactivity,
the
blake
rule
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
there
are
two
basic
reasons
for
that:
first,
that
it
rests
on
improper
factors;
and
second,
that
it
leads
to
results
that
the
bia
itself
has
disavowed.
first
of
all,
congress
has
never
suggested
that
the
words
that
it
chooses
in
deportation
provisions
are
somehow
a
key
to
eligibility
for
section
212(c)
relief,
and
yet
that
is
largely
everything
that
the
board
relied
on
in
blake,
was
a
comparison
of
the
choice
of
words
in
deportation
provisions
to
the
choice
of
words
in
exclusion
provisions.
but
the
--
the
provisions
of
the
deportation
statute
are
not
some
enigmatic
code
from
which
the
bia
can
discern
section
212(c)
eligibility.
they
determine
who
is
deportable,
but
they
have
nothing
to
say
about
who
is
eligible
for
section
212
c.
section
212
c
eligibility
turns
on
whether
you
are
inadmissible.
that
is
what
212
c
by
its
terms
refers
to.
and
that's
driven
home,
i
believe,
by
the
addition
of
the
crime
of
violence
language
in
1990
as
a
basis
for
deportation.
aggravated
felonies
were
added
in
1990
at
a
time
when
it
--
i
believe
it's
clear
that
most
of
them,
if
not
all
of
them,
were
already
bases
for
exclusion.
so
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
say
crimes
of
violence
are
excludable,
they
already
were
because
they
were
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
it
would
have
been
redundant
to
put
the
same
words
in
the
exclusion
statute.
congress
didn't
do
it.
congress
simply
wanted
to
make
clear
that
these
people
were
now
going
to
be
deportable
based
on
the
length
of
their
sentence.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes,
it
does,
justice
ginsburg.
and
because
mr.
st.
cyr
would
have
been
both
deportable
and
excludable
for
his
offense.
that
is
the
logic.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
the
board
in
blake
concluded
that
that
was
--
that
the
linguistic
comparison
worked
there
so
that
it
did
not
have
to
find
itself
at
odds
with
this
court's
decision
in
st.
cyr,
that's
true.
but
when
the
court
--
when
the
board
originally
made
that
decision
in
matter
of
meza,
they
didn't
just
look
to
the
linguistic
comparison.
i
agree
that
if
there
is
a
perfect
linguistic
match,
then
you
might
not
need
to
go
to
look
at
the
conviction,
because
someone
who
falls
under
one
may
not
necessarily
fall
under
the
other.
but
just
because
congress
uses
different
words
in
the
deportation
subsection
that
is
asserted
against
a
particular
alien
doesn't
mean
that
the
analysis
stops,
there,
because
the
conviction
might
well
make
the
person
excludable
such
that
the
application
that
they
are
able
to
file
in
deportation
proceedings
should
give
them
the
same
relief
that
they
would
have
in
an
exclusion
proceedings.
so
what
happened
in
1990
when
212
c
eligibility
stealthily
and
silently,
because
of
course
while
congress
was
amending
212
c
at
that
time,
saying
it
was
no
longer
available
to
deportable
aliens
who
didn't
show
up
for
certain
hearings
and
no
longer
available
for
aggravated
felons
who
were
deportable
who
had
served
more
than
five
years
in
prison,
it
had
said
nothing
suggesting
that
people
who
had
committed
aggravated
felony
crimes
of
violence
were
all
of
a
sudden
ineligible
for
section
212
c
relief,
even
though
it
could
have
said
that.
the
notion
that
one
can
infer
or
decode
those
provisions
as
shutting
out
section
212
c
relief
for
this
group
of
people
silently,
even
though
the
overlap
is
perfect
if
not
near
perfect
is
we
would
submit
simply
unreasonable.
the
arbitrariness
comes
through
in
another
way
which
is
that--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--that
is
not
the
way
that
the
agency
has
ever
treated
permanent
resident
aliens.
in
fact,
if
that
is
the
government's
position
that
is
clearly
a
change
in
the
law.
the
bia
said
going
back
to
silva,
but
in
matter
of
aa
a
1992
published
decision
that
it
is
the
long
--
quote
"long
established
view
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
federal
courts
that
an
application
for
section
212(c)
relief
filed
in
the
context
of
deportation
proceedings
is
equivalent
to
one
made
at
the
time
an
alien
physically
seeks
admission
into
the
united
states.
"
that
is
footnote
22
of
matter
of
aa.
so
the
agency's
longstanding
position,
at
least
since
silva,
has
been
that
there
is
no
difference
between
an
application
filed
in
deportation
and
one
filed
in
exclusion.
and
that
i
think
is
consistent
with
what
attorney
general
thornburg
said
in
the
matter
of
hernandez-casillas.
i'd
submit
one
last
point,
which
is
the
arbitrariness
of
what
the
bia
is
doing
shines
through
in
that
it
has
led
to
consequences
that
the
bia
has
itself
repudiated
as
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
and
the
most
salient
example
is
the
one
that
the
government
admits
on
page
26
of
its
brief,
which
is
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
someone
could
get
a
waiver
of
inadmissibility
one
day
for
a
given
conviction
and
then
be
deported
the
next
day
for
the
very
same
conviction.
now
the
bia
in
1956
in
matter
of
g.a.
said
that
was
clearly
repugnant.
that
the
agency
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
the
statute
cannot
mean
x
and
not
x.
if
it
does,
that
is
the
hallmark
of
arbitrariness.
the
government's
only
answer,
as
far
as
i
know,
is
that
it
will
exercise
its
prosecutorial
discretion
to
avoid
that
situation.
i
would
submit
that
an
agency
cannot
defend
an
arbitrary
policy
by
saying
that
it
is
going
to
be
enforced
in
a
capricious
way
and
that
it
will
all
balance
out
in
the
end.
this
court
should
evaluate
the
blake
rule
on
its
own
merits
and
if
it
is
arbitrary,
as
it
clearly
is,
it
should
be
disapproved.
the
other
indication
of
arbitrariness
is
that
the
blake
rule
revives
the
distinction
between
deportable
aliens,
justice
kennedy,
who
traveled
abroad
and
returned
and
other
deportable
aliens
who
did
not
travel
aboard
and
returned.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes,
justice
kagan.
the
evidence
is
the
attorney
general's
opinion
in
hernandez-casillas.
the
government's
only
citation
for
that
is
a
footnote
in
wadud
arguing
that
supposedly
the
nunc
pro
tunc
doctrine
is
not
still
good
law.
but
five
years
after
wadud,
in
hernandez-casillas,
attorney
general
thornburg
was
asked
by
the
ins
to
disapprove
matter
of
l
--
justice
jackson's
decision
as
attorney
general,
and
matter
of
g-a
and
the
nunc
pro
tunc
doctrine
that
is
set
out
in
those
decisions,
and
he
expressly
declined
to
do
so.
on
the
contrary,
he
reaffirmed
that
in
cases
where
the
alien
has
left
and
come
back,
the
attorney
general
and
the
board
have
permitted
the
alien
to
raise
any
claim
for
discretionary
relief
that
the
alien
could
otherwise
have
raised
had
he
been
excluded.
so
nunc
pro
tunc
clearly
is
still
good
law,
and
the
government
seemed
to
agree
with
that
as
recently
as
its
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
as
for
the
travel
distinction
itself
the
government
to
its
credit
does
not
try
to
defend
it,
and
for
good
reason.
the
agency
in
silva
has
long
held
that
there
is
no
distinction
or
no
rational
way
to
distinguish
under
the
statute
between
people
who
are
in
deportation
proceedings
who
have
left
and
come
back
and
people
in
deportations
who
have
not.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
i
reserve
of
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
begin
simply
by
following
up
on
the
questions
that
justices
ginsburg
and
kagan
asked
to
my
brother
about
my
client
could
have
been
charged
as
deportable
with
his
conviction
treated
as
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
in
fact,
he
was.
if
one
looks
at
the
decisions
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
specifically
at
page
11a,
it's
clear
that
his
conviction
is
asserted
not
only
as
an
aggravated
felony
crime
of
violence,
but
also
as
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
and
the
immigration
judge
found
that
he
was
in
fact
deportable
with
that
conviction
forming
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
so
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
mr.
judulang's
conviction
falls
into
both
categories.
on
the
issue
of
the
factual
basis
of
my
client's
deportability
at
the
time
of
the
plea,
mr.
gannon
is
correct;
there
is
nothing
in
the
administrative
record
that
says
that,
and
that
is
why
this
court
typically
does
not
countenance
arguments
based
on
the
facts
by
the
respondents
that
are
raised
only
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
if
anyone
had
suggested
that
this
was
an
issue
on
which
a
factual
record
needed
to
be
developed,
we
could
have
done
it;
it
would
not
have
been
hard.
i
also
want
to
comment
on
one
point
that
mr.
gannon
made,
which
is
the
thing
that
--
that
is
waived
under
212(c)
is
a
ground
of
deportation.
that's
not
correct.
section
212(c)
provides
relief
from
inadmissibility.
it
says
that
clearly
in
its
text;
that
is
how
the
regulations
and
the
decisions
have
always
treated
it.
the
form
that
immigrants
are
instructed
to
fill
out,
form
i-90
--
i-191
which
is
appended
to
our
blue
brief
specifically
says:
state
the
reasons
you
may
be
inadmissible
to
the
united
states.
if
a
waiver
of
inadmissibility
is
granted,
that
waiver
protects
the
immigrant
from
subsequent
deportation
based
on
the
same
conviction.
that
is
the
language
of
matter
of
g-a,
which
the
government
itself
excerpts
in
its
brief;
and
justice
ginsburg
is
correct,
that
is
--
they
admit
that
a
waiver
is
durable
in
that
sense.
if
it
is
granted
to
waive
inadmissibility,
it
protects
the
alien
from
deportation
on
any
deportation
subsection
based
on
that
same
conviction.
i
thought
it
was
telling,
justice
breyer,
in
reaction
to
your
question
which
--
which
was
seeking
an
explanation
of
how
this
scheme
is
reasonable,
the
answer
that
counsel
for
the
government
gave
was
that
the
bia
has
been
consistent
with
firearms
and
visa
fraud
cases,
but
there
was
no
explanation
as
to
how
the
blake
rule
as
it
is
now
drawn
is
in
any
way
a
reasonable
application
of
the
law.
i
would
submit
for
the
reasons
that
your
honor
pointed
out,
which
is
that
we
have
a
number
of
--
whether
one
calls
them
convictions
or
whether
one
calls
them
categories
of
crimes
--
voluntary
manslaughter,
aggravated
burglary
--
recall
that
we
are
talking
about
aggravated
felony
crimes
of
violence.
i
recognize
that
if
we
talk
about
third
degree
burglary,
which
could
be
charged
on
the
basis
of
someone
opening
an
unlocked
door
and
walking
across
the
threshold,
maybe
that's
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
but
it
is
probably
is
not
an
aggravated
felony
crime
of
violence
either,
certainly
not
in
this
court's
decision.
so
i
would
submit
that
the
government
has
not
identified
a
crime
that
would
be
both
an
aggravated
felony
crime
of
violence
and
yet
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
the
overlap
is,
i
would
submit,
total.
and
even
if
it's
not
total,
that
is
not
the
end
of
our
argument
because
the
board
itself
has
said
you,
don't
need
a
perfect
match;
you
just
need
substantial
overlap.
and
the
overlap
is
at
the
very
least
substantial,
if
not
complete.
the
crime
that
was
charged
in
brieva-perez
itself,
unauthorized
use
of
a
vehicle
under
texas
law,
has
subsequently
held
by
the
fifth
circuit
not
to
be
an
aggravated
felony
at
all.
so
brieva-perez
on
its
own
terms
is
no
longer
good
law
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief.
the
interest
that
mr.
gannon
asserted
at
one
point
about
getting
immigrants
to
put
themselves
into
exclusion
proceedings,
this
is
a
very
important
point.
the
agency
has
never
suggested
that
that
is
the
way
that
it
runs
the
railroad.
on
the
contrary,
it
has
expressly
said
the
opposite.
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
212(c)
application
is
filed
in
exclusion
proceedings,
in
deportation
proceedings,
or
outside
of
proceedings
entirely
by
sending
a
letter
to
the
district
director
saying:
please
give
me
an
advance
waiver
before
i
travel
abroad.
the
regulations
make
very
clear
and
the
decisions
make
very
clear,
i
quoted
matter
of
aa
in
my
opening
argument,
that
an
application
is
identical
and
a
relief
that
is
given
is
identical,
regardless
of
the
proceedings.
for
mr.
gannon
to
stand
up
and
say
that
the
agency
is
now
creating
a
sharp
distinction,
saying
that
applications
filed
in
exclusion
are
omnipotent,
and
applications
filed
in
deportation
proceedings
are
meaningless
is
a
clear
change
in
the
law,
and
it
is
unfair
to
apply
it
against
immigrants
like
mr.
judulang
and
others
who
relied
on
the
availability
of
section
212(c)
as
protection
from
removal,
whether
exclusion
or
deportation
in
the
future,
when
they
pled
guilty.
justice
sotomayor,
your
question
about
how
many
people
are
involved
here,
it
is
difficult
to
identify
specific
numbers
because
very
often
these
cases
are
decided
at
the
immigration
judge
level
that
are
not
reported.
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
we
identified
over
160
people
who
have
been
subject
--
who
have
suffered
under
the
blake
rule
since
blake
was
decided
in
2005.
and
part
of
the
problem
is
that
we
are
talking
about
a
group
of
people
who
have
been
in
the
country
for
a
long
time,
whose
convictions
are
dated,
who
are
law
abiding,
who
are
reformed,
and
they
only
come
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities
subsequently
through
perfectly
law
abiding
conduct
such
as
applying
for
naturalization
or
renewing
a
green
card
so
that
they--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--and
potentially
subject
them
to
removal,
exactly.
and
there
might
be
other
forms
of
relief,
as
mr.
gannon
mentioned.
but
--
that's
certainly
right.
but
a
good
number
of
the
people
here
who
have
been
harmed
by
the
blake
rule
are
people
who
are
the
most
deserving
candidates
for
relief.
and
the
nijc
brief,
i
think,
sets
that
out
i
think
quite
convincingly.
we
would
submit
that
the
only
reasonable
approach
here
is
the
one
that
the
agency
took
for
years
under
meza
and
under
the
eight
decisions
that
justice
breyer
referenced
where
the
immigration
knew
the
rule,
they
applied
it,
they
looked
to
the
conviction,
they
figured
out
whether
the
conviction
would
trigger
excludability;
if
it
did,
then
the
alien
was
entitled
to
apply
on
the
same
basis
and
with
the
same
effect
as
if
he
had
found
himself
in
exclusion
proceedings.
the
judgment
should
be
reversed,
and
mr.
judulang
should
be
allowed
to
file
his
application
for
adjudication
on
the
merits.
