well,
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
the
statutory
changes
in
the
policy
of
the
ins
date
back
to,
was
it
the
second
circuit's
case
in
francis,
which
talked
about
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
two
classes
comprised
of
those
in
exclusion
proceedings
and
those
in
what
were
then
called
deportation
proceedings.
do
we
just
accept
that?
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that
whole
equal
protection
rationale
is
quite
doubtful.

so
if
we
thought
that
they
had
gone
down
the
wrong
path
originally,
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it,
and
we
just
say
we're
in
this
wilderness
and
we
can't
get
out?
