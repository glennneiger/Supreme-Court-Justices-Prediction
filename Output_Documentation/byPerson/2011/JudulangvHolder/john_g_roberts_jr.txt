chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-694,
judulang
v.
holder.
mr.
fleming.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
the
advice
of
counsel,
but
what
is
the
reasonable
expectation
of
that's
been
altered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
that
the
expectation
is
when
he
pleads
guilty
to
a
violent
felony,
that
he
expects,
well,
if
i
am
deported
because
of
that
i
am
going
to
be
able
to
seek
discretionary
waiver?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
often
are
these
waivers
granted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
terms
of
the
expectation
interest,
we
have
to
visualize
someone
who
is
facing
a
serious
charge
and
is
entering
a
plea
bargain,
where
presumably
the
consideration
of
what
he's
pleading
to,
how
much
of
a
sentence
he's
going
to
get,
all
that,
are
dominant
considerations.
and
he's
also
going
to
say:
well,
i
have
been
advised
that
i
will
be
able
to
apply
for
a
discretionary
waiver,
so
i'm
going
to
plead
guilty.
that's
a
fairly
unlikely
scenario,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
not
questioning
the
fact
that
he
was
advised,
but
presumably
the
lawyer
will
also
advise
him:
oh,
and
you
also
have
to
pay
the
$250,
you
know,
restitution,
whatever,
fee.
i
am
just
questioning
how
significant
that
advice
will
be
when
someone's
determining
whether
to
plead
guilty
or
not
to
a
violent
felony.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
let
justice
sotomayor
jump
in
now
with
her
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gannon.
mr.
fleming,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-694,
judulang
versus
holder.
