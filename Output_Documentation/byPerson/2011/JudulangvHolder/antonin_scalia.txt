how
do
you
explain
--
i
mean,
i
think
that
is
a
principal
point,
whether
blake
and
brieva
changed
the
law.
how
do
you
explain
the
language
in
matter
of
wadud,
which
antedates
by
a
good
deal
those
two
cases,
1984,
which
says:
"section
212(c)
can
only
be
invoked
in
a
deportation
hearing
where
the
ground
of
deportation
charged
is
also
a
ground
of
inadmissibility.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
basic
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
reliance
on
confused
law
is
certainly
not
reasonable
reliance.
i
mean,
if
you
accept
the
--
the
premise
that
justice
kagan
operates
from,
how
can
you
say
that
--
that
you're
reasonably
relying
on
confused
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
you
say
even
further
reduces
the
significance
of
the
212(c)
possibility
of
waiver
to
the
person
pleading
guilty.
you
are
saying
--
you
are
saying,
yes,
even
though
--
even
though
you
couldn't
get
it
under
212(c),
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ways
you
might
have
gotten
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
there
is
a
large
category
of
people
who
--
who
plead
guilty
to
crimes
that
do
not
involve
moral
turpitude
and
yet
are
not
otherwise
excludable
under
212(c);
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
hear
this
answer?
i
was
very
interested
in
the
question.
it
seemed
to
make
a
good
point.
