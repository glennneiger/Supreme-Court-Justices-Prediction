justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
but
it
may
save
a
little
time.
i
worry
we're
in
an
arcane
area
of
the
law.
it
was
created
by
robert
jackson,
attorney
general
and
by
thorn
burg,
attorney
general.
and
if
we
are
starting
with
that,
what
that
says
is
we
have
a
list
over
here
of
excludable
things
and
we
have
a
list
of
deportable
things.
and
if
you
are
deported
for
a
reason
that
shows
up
on
that
first
list,
than
the
ag
could
waive.
that's
basically
the
outline
i
have.
and
also
i
have,
which
isn't
quite
right,
that
in
that
first
list
there
is
something
called
--
in
big
letters,
cimt
or
something,
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
and
all
of
the
things
on
the
second
list,
the
big
issue
is,
is
it
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
as
i
looked
through
the
opinions,
this
is
what
i
got
out
of
it.
this
is
tentative.
i
got
out,
just
as
you
say,
there
are
two
things
in
the
second
list
which
are
not
crimes
of
moral
turpitude.
they
consist
of
illegal
entry
crimes
and
gun
crimes.
and
there
are
special
reasons
for
the
first
and
the
second
is
debatable,
but
they
have
been
consistent
with
that.
then
there
are
things
that
are
on
both
lists,
they
are
crimes
of
moral
turpitude.
i
counted
at
least
eight
cases.
say,
for
example,
rape,
burglary,
manslaughter,
second
degree
robbery,
indecency
with
a
child
and
probably
some
others
are
all
crimes
of
moral
turpitude,
so
it
cuts
here,
okay.
then
i
find
blake,
and
blake
says
sexual
abuse
of
a
minor
is
not
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
that's
a
little
surprising.
but
it
gives
us
a
reason
because,
and
this
was
the
problem
here,
it
talks
about,
there
has
to
be
substantial
--
there
has
to
be
similar
language
in
the
two
lists.
i
don't
know
where
that
one
came
from.
it
certainly
had
not
been
in
the
earlier
cases.
and
now
we
have
this
case,
which
is
voluntary
manslaughter.
i
would
have
thought
that
voluntary
manslaughter
is
right
at
the
heart
of
the
lists
that
they
said
the
things
are
crimes
of
moral
turpitude,
and
not
like
visa
crimes
or
gun
crimes,
if
i
read
the
cases.
so
where
do
i
end
up?
well,
what
i
end
up
with
is
this.
and
this
is
what
i
would
like
you
to
reply
to.
justice
brandies
once
said
something
like
we
have
to
know
before
we
can
say
whether
an
agency
opinion
is
right
or
wrong,
what
they
are
talking
about.
i
felt
perplexity
after
i
had
read
through
these
decisions.
in
other
words,
i
don't
understand
it.
so
i
would
like
you
to
explain
to
me
why
this
all
fits
together
and
how,
if
you
can
do
that,
i
couldn't
get
that
clear
explanation
from
the
brief,
and
i
suspect
it
is
not
your
fault.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rape,
burglary,
manslaughter,
second-degree
robbery
--
all
of
those
cases
--
about
seven
or
eight
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
--
that
may
be
his
approach.
my
approach
is
look
to
the
category.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look
to
the
category.
and
the
category
here
is
not,
you
know,
category
as
in
crime,
the
category
is
what
kind
of
a
crime.
and
this
is
a
crime
of
violence.
in
the
statute,
or
if
you
look
at
what
was
charged,
it's
called
voluntary
manslaughter.
either
way,
i
would
think
those
categories
as
categories
fall
within
"crime
of
moral
turpitude".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
go
back
to
the
second
one?
it's
very
interesting.
suppose
i
say:
okay,
i
concede.
i'd
only
do
it
for
the
sake
of
this
question:
you
are
absolutely
right
in
your
categorization.
the
right
category
is
crime
of
violence.
and
then
i
look
at
the
statute,
which
is
8
u.s.c.
1101(43),
which
you
probably
know
by
heart
--
and
i
look
at
the
definition
of
gun
crimes,
and
i
look
at
crimes
of
violence.
my
non-schooled
reaction
is,
well,
gun
crimes,
i
can
see
why
they
said
that
wasn't
really
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
registration
requirements,
there
are
all
kinds
of
different
things
that
drug
dealers
--
gun
dealers
have
to
do,
and
you
could
commit
that
crime
in
various
ways
that
don't
involve
moral
turpitude.
i
can
understand
that,
sort
of.
at
least,
i
can
see
how
somebody
else
might
have
understood
it
that
way.
now,
i
think
crimes
of
violence,
i
say,
hey,
i
am
having
trouble
here.
why
don't
you
try
to
list
a
few
crimes
of
violence
that
when
they
come
into
the
country
you
are
going
to
say,
oh,
that
wasn't
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude?
and
by
the
way,
i
am
not
asking
you
to
list
specific
examples;
i
am
asking
you
to
list
categories.
list
categories
of
crimes
of
violence
that
when
the
person
comes
in,
you
are
going
to
say,
hmm,
no
moral
turpitude
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
not
a
crime
of
--
that
is
not
a
moral
turpitude,
simple
assault?
you're
going
to
just
hit
somebody?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
burglary
--
isn't
burglary
where
it
might
be
an
occupied
building?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no.
a
warehouse.
i
am
being
--
quibbling
now.
of
course,
my
basic
concern--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
really?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
are
some.
there
are
some.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
a
little
odd,
but
what
i'm
raising--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
what
i'm
afraid
of
is
this:
that
once
you
put
this
in
your
category,
that
you
say
crimes
of
violence
are
not
crimes
of
moral
turpitude,
then
to
a
large
extent
you
have
said
good-bye,
justice
or
attorney
general
robert
jackson.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying
good-bye
to
jackson
and
thornburgh,
because
you
have
driven
such
a
wedge
between
these
two
statutes
that
there's
hardly
anybody
who
would
be
able
to
qualify
for
the
jackson-thornburgh
approach
to
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
overstate
slightly,
but
you
see
my
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
also
telling
me
that
--
i
didn't
know
this;
i
learn
something
in
every
argument
--
that
if
we
have
jack
the
cat
burglar
who
was
burgling
dozens
of
office
buildings
--
and
abroad
--
and
assaults
people
and
hits
them
over
the
head
or
whatever
with
his
--
i
guess
with
his
fist,
that
we
have
no
way
of
excluding
that
person,
should
he
try
--
i
--
i
have
heard
criticisms
of
our
immigration
policy,
but
this
is
surprising
to
me,
that
we
have
no
way
of
excluding
that
person
who
is
filled
with
the
simple
burglary
of
office
buildings
and
assaults.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
has
only
done
it
once;
we
have
to
let
him--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
take
it
they
haven't
decided.
so--
