mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
does
not
dispute
that
some
comparability
analysis
must
be
applied
to
prevent
relief
under
former
section
212
c
from
being
extended
to
certain
grounds
of
de
portability.
but
his
methodology
of
asking
whether
his
offense
could
have
made
him
excludable
is
inconsistent
with
established
cases
from
the
board
that
long
predated
the
ones
at
issue
here
involving
firearms
offenses
and
visa
fraud.
justice
scalia
brought
up
the
case
in
wadud.
that
was
a
visa
fraud
case.
it
was
a
prosecution
under
18
u.s.c.
1546.
that's
a
provision
that
penalizes
fraudulent
and
other
misuse
of
visas
and
other
immigration
documents.
it's
a
very
broad
criminal
provision.
it's
long
been
a
ground
of
de
portability.
and
at
the
time
the
alien
argued
that
this
is
fraud.
it's
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
and
therefore
i
would
be
subject
to
exclusion.
in
wadud
the
board
rejected
that
analysis.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
agree
that
the
history
and
the
law
here
is
relatively
complicated
and
it
has
had
a
lot
of
moving
pieces
over
the
years.
but
i
think
that
the
board
has
been
very
consistent,
especially
beginning
in
the
1984
wadud
decision
that
was
picked
up
in
the
jimenez-santillano
decision
and
also
in
firearms
offenses.
justice
breyer,
you
talked
about
the
fact
that
the
board
had
been
consistent
in
firearms
offenses.
and
the
petitioner
does
not
dispute
that
firearms
offenses
are
ones
that
do
not
have
a
comparable
ground--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--if
i
could
go
back
for
a
second
to
firearms
offenses.
the
board
there
has
continued
to
say
that
there
is
no
comparable
ground
for
firearms
offenses,
even
if
your
firearms
offense
would
be
something
that
could
have
been
considered
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
if
you
look
at
the
board's
1992
decision
in
montenegro,
that
was
a
case
that
was
assault
with
a
firearm,
and
so
it
wasn't
merely
possession
of
a
handgun
or
an
automatic
weapon
or
a
sawed-off
shotgun--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
board
pointed
out
in
the
brieva-perez
decision
that
minor
but
relatively
common
crimes
of
violence,
including
simple
assaults
and
burglary,
generally
are
not
considered
to
be
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
in
the
reply
brief,
petitioner
points
to
a
board
petition
in
louissaint
saying
that
--
that
the
record
is
muddled
on
burglary,
but
that
opinion
only
showed
that
residential
burglary
isn't
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
and
a
crime
of
violence,
in
the
definition,
is
one
that
involves
the
use
of
physical
force
against
personal
property
of
another.
and
so
it
doesn't
need
to
be
aggravated
in
any
other
sense.
it
doesn't
need
to
be--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
it
was
a
crime--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
it
was.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
petitioner's
approach
of
looking
to
the
conviction
is
inconsistent
with
the
board's
repeated--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and,
justice
breyer--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
but
--
but
the
category
that
is
relevant
is
the
crime
of
violence.
and
as
i
just
discussed
with
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
indeed
crimes
of
violence
that
satisfy
the
statutory
definition
in
18
u.s.c.
16--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--if
i
could
finish
up
on
the
firearms
analogy,
i
think
that
this
is
responsive,
justice
breyer,
to
your
point
about
looking
at
the
category.
and
in
montenegro,
the
board
specifically
concluded
that
this
offense,
assault
with
a
firearm,
it's
a
firearms
offense,
but
because
we've
already
concluded
that
as
a
categorical
matter,
firearms
offenses
aren't
on
the
list
of
exclusion
crimes;
we
don't
care
and
we're
not
going
to
ask
ourselves
whether
it
could
have
been
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
the
board
applied
that
same
reasoning
again
in
the
1995
opinion
in
espinoza.
we
quote
all
of
these
opinions
on
page
41
of
our
brief.
and
so,
in
these
two
categories,
firearms
offenses
and
visa
fraud
offenses,
both
of
which
could
often
involve
moral
turpitude
on
an
--
in
any
individual
case
--
that
such
offenses
could
involve
moral
turpitude,
just
like
a
crime
of
violence
may
well
involve
moral
turpitude,
and
yet
the
board
concluded
that
because
as
a
categorical
matter,
this
is
not
comparable
to
any
grounds
of
exclusion,
it
was
going
to
say
that
it
was
not
going
to
extend
this
relief,
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--no.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
board
has
made
it
clear
from
as
early
as
the
meza
decision
that
it
would
look
into
the
specific
category
within
the
definition
of
aggravated
felony
--
in
order
to
be
a
category--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--because
that
is
not
the
category
in
the
aggravated
felony
definition
that
we
are
talking
about.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
crimes
of
violence.
that's
the
category.
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
do
have
that
category
here.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
that
there's
no
dispute
about
that
between
us
and
petitioner.
if
somebody
had
a
firearms
offense,
it
could
have
been
charged
either
way.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
what
i'm
trying--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
what
it
--
the
reason
it
makes
sense
is
because
the
statute
only
provides
for
relief
from
grounds
of
inadmissibility
or
exclusion.
by
its
terms--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
the
way
--
the
way
this
doctrine
developed,
justice
kagan,
is
that
it
developed
in
the
context
where
the
board
recognized
that
the
statute
only
applied
to
waiver
of
grounds
of
excludability,
and
it
extended
that
to
deportation
cases
when
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
same
grounds
that
could
have
been
presented
in
the
exclusion
proceeding.
and
so
that's
all
we
are
trying
to
do
here,
is
to
continue
with
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
reason
why
that's
so
is
because
the
thing
that
is
going
to
be
waived
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
is
the
ground
of
deportation.
and
so
if
the
ground
of
deportation
is
for
an
aggravated
crime
of
felony
violence,
then
it
needs
to
be
one
for
which
there's
212(c)
eligibility.
the
same
would
be
true
if
it
were
a
firearms
offense
--
if
it
were--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's
true.
it's
also
true
in
the
firearms
offense
cases
and
the
visa
fraud
offense
cases,
because
those
are
all
instances
in
which,
depending
on
the
circumstance
of
the
offense
and
depending
upon
what
it
was
charged,
the
board
has
concluded
that
the
1546
offense
is
divisible.
some
of
those
crimes
are
involving
moral
turpitude,
some
of
them
are
not.
and
i
--
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
i
think
that
this
is
not
only
consistent
with
the
history,
it
is
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
regulation
the
petitioner
is
invoking
here,
which
makes
it
clear
that
what
is
being
waived
is
a
ground
of
exclusion
or
deportability
or
removability.
and
so
what
is
relevant
is
whether
the
ground
of
removability
is
the
aggravated
felony
crime
of
violence
ground
or
the
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
ground.
depending
on
which
ground
it
is,
that's
what
he
is
seeking
relief
for--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
have
no
cases
in
which
that
has
happened.
and
the
cases
in
which
the
board
said
that
that
result
would
be
clearly
repugnant
were
ones
in
which
there
was
a
comparable
ground.
the
board
was
saying
that
if
you
get
212(c)
relief
on
the
grounds
of
exclusion--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--pardon?
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
no,
there
--
there
are
no
cases
that
address
that
principle
in
the
context
where
there
is
no
comparable
grounds.
and
if
--
if
i
could
just
make
one
point
about
this
claim
of
petitioner's
in
his
reply
brief
that
he
could
have
been
subject
to
a
charge
of
deportability
on
the
basis
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
i
would
caution
the
court
against
relying
on
that
for
two
reasons,
one
factual
and
one
legal.
one
is
that
there
is
no
factual
basis
in
the
administrative
record
to
--
to
talk
about
this
1987
trip
to
the
philippines.
yes,
we
do
have
evidence
from
outside
the
record
that
makes
us
believe
that
it
occurred,
but
the
statute
that
provides
for
judicial
review
here
of
the
order
of
removability
in
8
u.s.c.
1252(b)(4)(a)
specifically
says
that
the
determination
needs
to
be
made
on
a
basis
of
the
administrative
record.
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
about
that
trip
is
actually
a
statement
from
petitioner's
mother
that
says
that
it
occurred
in
1989,
the
year
after
the
crime.
but
even
assuming
that
--
that
the
trip
happened,
in
light
--
as
i
said,
we
do
believe
on
the
basis
of
evidence
outside
the
record
that
it
did
occur
--
there
is
a
legal
reason
why
i
would
caution
the
court
against
assuming
that
that
means
the
petitioner
could
have
been
deportable
for
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
and
that
is
the
so-called
fleuti
doctrine.
under
this
court's
1963
decision
in
rosenberg
v.
fleuti,
which
is
actually
relevant
to
a
case
on
which
you
granted
certiorari
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
this
court
concluded
that
if
an
lpr
takes
a
brief,
casual,
and
innocent
trip
outside
the
country
and
returns
to
the
united
states,
that
will
not
trigger
an
entry
upon
his
return
to
the
united
states.
and
so
i
think
it's
very
likely
that
under
ninth
circuit
precedent
in
1989,
when
petitioner
was
pleading
guilty
to
his
voluntary
manslaughter
charge,
he
wouldn't
have
had
any
reason
to
think
that
he
was
doing
so
within
5
years
of
when
he
committed
--
when
he
entered
the
country
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
i
think
it's
also--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
chief
examples
are
the
ones
that
the
board
gives
in
the
brieva-perez
opinion,
which
are
simple
assaults,
which
has--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that
is
correct,
it
is
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
neither
is
non-residential
burglary
which
involves
force
against
--
against
property,
which
would
therefore
satisfy
the
definition.
this
is
an
opinion
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--if
it
were
an
occupied
building,
if
it
were
a
dwelling--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
the
ninth
circuit,
burglary
of
a
residential
dwelling
that's
occupied
is
not
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
in
--
in
a
case
that
is
cited
in
the
concurring
opinion--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--there
certainly
are.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
they
tend
to
be
minor
--
minor
--
more
minor
offenses.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
don't--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
just--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
see
your
point,
justice
breyer,
and
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
cases
that
predate
the
era
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
they
all
--
almost
all
involve
two
categories
of
defenses,
drug
trafficking
or
controlled
substance
offenses
and
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude,
things
that
were
actually
charged
under
the
ground
of
deportation
for
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
and
here,
congress
added
aggravated
felonies
to
the
deportation
side
of
the
ledger,
but
didn't
add
it
to
the
exclusion
side
of
the
ledger.
and
then
it
repeatedly
expanded
the
definition
of
1988
and
1996
in
ways
that
made
these
offenses
treatable
in
different
ways
for
purposes
of
deportation
than
they
were
for
exclusion.
and
as
a
category--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's
--
i
disagree,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
disagree
with
that
--
the
fact
that
that's
the
category
we
are
looking
at.
we're
looking
inside
the
definition
of
aggravated
felony,
to
the
particular
ground
which
is
crimes
of
violence.
and
then
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
analysis
needs
to
be
done
at
a
categorical
level.
and
the
board
has
said
that
you
cannot
get
a
212(c)
waiver
from
a
ground
of
deportability
unless
that
ground
of
deportability
is
substantially
equivalent
to
a
waivable
ground
of
exclusion.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes,
the
officer
could
say
that.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
generally,
yes.
i
mean
--
we
are
talking
about
pre-1996
offenses.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
we
don't
have
any
examples
like
that,
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
--
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
ultimately,
even
the
durability
of
the
212(c)
waiver
wouldn't
necessarily
have
protected
somebody
against
a
subsequent
proceeding.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
we--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
we
--
the
brief
did
say
that
this
is
hypothetically
possible.
i
am
aware
of
no
instances
in
which
it
has
happened,
and
we
don't
have
a
board
decision
about
what
the
effect
of
the
earlier
waiver
would
be
on
a
non-comparable
ground
in
a
subsequent
deportation
proceeding.
and
i
do
think,
however,
that,
regardless
of
the
prosecutorial
discretion
point
here,
even
if
the
board
were
to
conclude
that
the
212(c)
waiver
carried
across
and
would
prevent
this
alien
from
being
deportable
in
a
subsequent
proceeding,
an
important
purpose
would
still
be
served
by
encouraging
the
alien
to
get
himself
into
exclusion
proceedings
at
the
beginning,
because
that
is
what
several
courts
have
concluded
would
be
a
rational
basis
for
differential
treatment
in
encouraging
aliens
to
seek
212(c)
waivers
in
the
exclusion
context.
congress,
when
it
adopted
the
aggravated
felony
definition
and
repeatedly
expanded
it,
it
was
concerned
about
criminal
aliens
in
this
country,
and
ways
to
get
them
out
of
this
country.
and
so,
to
the
extent
that
212(c)
relief
still
is
available
for
certain
lprs
who
meet
certain
threshold
criteria
and
they
are
being
deported
on
the
basis
of
crimes
that
would
have
made
them
inadmissible
--
if
an
alien
then
wants
to
seek
212(c)
relief,
he
can
get
himself
into
an
exclusion
proceeding,
or
he
could
seek
advanced
parole
on
the
i-191
form
that
petitioner--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
there
was
a
separate
ground
which
is
two
crimes,
any
two
criminal
offenses.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
if
he
has
only
done
it
once,
then
it
may
well
be
that
it
wouldn't
qualify.
but
the
board
has
repeatedly
declined
to
consider
whether
such
a
crime,
which
would
be
--
could
potentially
be
a
ground
for
exclusion
would
automatically
guarantee
that
--
that
the
alien
could
receive
a
waiver
of
any
ground
of
deportability
based
on
the
same
conviction.
and
--
and
when
my
friend--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--no,
i'm
saying
that
the
board
repeatedly
declined
to
apply
this
analysis
in
the
context
of
firearms
offenses
and
visa
fraud
offenses
where
the
alien
said
my
offense
is
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude;
i
could
have
been
charged
with
being
--
i
could
have
been
excluded
on
the
basis
of
my
visa
fraud
offense
or
my
assault
with
a
firearm,
because
assault
with
a
fire
arm
is
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
there
--
there
is
a
new
provision,
cancellation
of
removal,
which
indisputably
just
simply
is
unavailable
to
anyone
with
a
aggravated
felony
conviction.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
--
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
we're
--
we're
giving
it
to
aliens
like
this,
aliens
who
have
older
convictions,
pre-1996
guilty
pleas--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that
--
that
is
if
it
was
a
crime
that
was
--
a
conviction
that
occurred
after
212(c)
was
repealed.
so
for
instance,
in
this
case
if
on
remand
the
board
considered
one
of
the
other
charge
grounds
of
deportation.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes,
because
212(c)
only
lives
on
by
virtue
of
st.
cyr
right
now.
and
i
--
but
--
but
i
do
want
to
stress
that
this
--
i
think
justice
kagan
was
correct
to
point
out
that
this
was
clarifying
a
previous
state
of
the
law.
we
believe
that
there
are
very
clear
principles
on
the
cases
that
are
cited
on
page
41
of
our
brief,
that
the
board
had
refused
to
do
the
analysis
on
--
on
a
conviction
level
as
opposed
to
a
categorical
level,
and
my
friend
keeps
quoting
attorney
general
thornburgh's
opinion
in
hernandez-casillas
for
his
readoption
of
the
nunc
pro
tunc
doctrine,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
attorney
general
there
made
it
very
clear
in
his
holding
that
he
was
reaffirming
the
statutory
counterpart
doctrine
as
it
existed
at
the
time,
and
at
page
291
of
his
opinion
he
says
that
he
rejects
the
board's
attempts
to
extend
212(c)
to,
quote,
"grounds
of
deportation
that
are
not
analogous
to
the
grounds
for
exclusion
listed
in
section
212(c).
"
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
that's
--
you're--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that
--
that
is
what
footnote
4
of
the
opinion
says.
that
is
clearly
an
under-inclusive
list
because
it
doesn't
include
visa
fraud
offensives
which
had
already
been
recognized
in
wadud
as
being
a
category
that
did
not
have
a
comparable
ground,
and
--
and
that
was
reaffirmed
later
in
the
jimenez-santillano
opinion.
my
friend
quotes
the
jimenez-santillano
opinion
in
--
in
his
reply
brief
for
the
proposition
that
wadud
was
really
about
the
facts.
this
was
his
answer
to
you,
justice
scalia.
but
if
you
look
at
the
jimenez
summary
of
what
actually
happened
in
wadud,
the
other
half
of
the
sentence
that's
being
quoted
there
says
the
board
in
wadud,
quote,
"observed
that
we
did
not
need
to
decide
whether
respondent's
1546
offense
was
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
because
no
ground
of
inadmissibility
enumerated
in
section
212(a)
of
the
act
was
comparable
to
section
1546.
"
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
don't
have
a
good
estimate
of
that
because
we
don't
know
how
many
offenders
with
pre-1996
guilty
pleas
will
end
up
being
picked
up
by
immigration
authorities
and
--
and
charged
under
these
circumstances.
petitioner
is
somebody
who
at
--
at
the
time
he
committed
his
offense
wasn't
even
an
aggravated
felon.
it's
only
by
virtue
of
the
retroactive
applicability
of
the
definition
that
he
became
an
aggravated
felon.
and
so
that
makes
the
sort
of
st.
cyr
question
about
his
reliance
a
--
a
bit
perplexing
here.
at
the
time
when
he
was
pleading
guilty
to
voluntary
manslaughter,
because
it
wasn't
within
5
years
of
--
of
entry,
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
and
therefore
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
ground
for
deportability,
and
it
also
was
not
yet
an
aggravated
felony.
so
he
had
no
reason
to
think
he
was
pleading
guilty
to
a
deportable
offense.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
don't
know
how
many
times
that
--
all
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
petitioner's
brief
and
--
and
the
amicus
brief,
there
is
a
gap
between
1996
and
about
2003,
because
of
the
repeal
of
212(c)
and
st.
cyr
and
the
regulations.
there
was
about
a
7-month
period
after
the
regulations
before
the
board
decided
blake
and
brieva-perez.
there
are
on
the
order
of
several
hundred
212(c)
applications
that
are
being
granted
by
the
board
each
year
right
now,
but
that's
with
a
backlog
of
cases
some
of
which
have
been
pending
for
--
for
an
incredibly
long
time.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
--
i
appreciate
your
chance
to
let
me
clarify,
justice
kagan.
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
we
stated
that
an
alien
could
avoid
the
statutory
counterpart
rule
by
leaving
the
country.
that
meant
that
by
getting
himself
into
an
exclusion
proceeding,
the
statutory
counterpart
rule
then
would
not
be
applicable.
it
didn't
mean
that
had
he
left
the
country,
come
back
if
they
did
an
exclusion
proceeding
and
they
put
in
a
subsequent
deportation
proceeding,
that
the
statutory
counterpart
rule
wouldn't
apply.
