mr.
whalen,
the
common
definition
of
deceit
is
acting
--
intentionally
giving
a
false
impression,
intentionally
giving
a
false
impression
with
the
intent
that
someone
will
act
on
it.
so
it
seems
that's
exactly
what
filing
a
false
return
is.
you
give
a
false
impression
of
what
your
income
is
with
the
intent
that
the
irs
will
accept
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
isn't
it
obvious?
what
proof
would
you
need?
you
submit
a
document
because
you
want
to
convey
a
false
impression
for
someone
to
act
on.
why
do
you
have
to
have
anything
more
than
that
to
establish
deceit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
it
in
the
briefs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
that
is
being
made
is
not
that
it's
fraud
and
deceit.
quite
the
opposite.
i
think
justice
breyer,
justice
sotomayor,
justice
scalia
have
tried
to
get
you
to
focus
on
the
evasion
that
involves
no
false
statement
at
all,
evading
payment
where
you
say
nothing.
what
would
be
the
crime
if
you
simply
don't
pay
your
taxes,
and
you
don't
file
returns,
so
you
are
not
filing
anything
that
is
false?
where
would
that
come
in
the
internal
revenue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
7206
is
the
lesser
offense.
i
mean,
you
don't
take
--
you
don't
dispute
that
the
heavier
crime
is
the
7201
crime,
that
is,
evasion.
it
gets
a
more
severe
penalty.
and
when
congress
picks
out
one
tax
crime
and
one
tax
crime
only,
why
wouldn't
we
assume
that
that's
what
congress
meant
with
respect
to
aggravated
felonies?
that
there
is
one
tax
crime,
the
most
serious
tax
crime;
that
fits
that
label.
and
the
(m)(i)
provision
deals
with
the
many,
many
statutes
that
involve
loss
--
fraud
or
deceit
and
loss
to
the
victim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
of
the
problems
that
was
brought
up
in
the
amicus
brief
which
actually
was
considered,
that
reading
the
(m)(i)
to
include
7206
offenses
would
also
--
would
bring
in
offenses
that
are
merely
misdemeanors
at
the
state
and
local
level,
it
would
really
swell
the
category
of
tax
crimes
that
lead
to
deportation.
that
--
did
congress
really
mean
to
turn
misdemeanors
into
aggravated
felons?
and
then
there
was
a
very
practical
point
made
that
government
is
going
to
be
hurt
more
than
helped
by
what
you
are
seeking,
because
we
are
told
that
very
often
the
government
will
try
to
make
a
bargain.
it
has
a
7201
case,
but
it's
going
to
be
a
little
hard
to
prove.
so
they
offer
as
a
plea
bargain
7206.
and
if
you
--
if
your
position
prevails,
we
are
told,
there
will
be
many,
many
people
who
will
say:
if
it's
a
question
of
whether
i
get
thrown
out
of
the
united
states,
i'm
going
to
go
to
trial;
i'm
not
going
to
plead
to
something
that
will
mean
immediately
when
i
serve
my
time
i
will
be
thrown
out
of
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a
technical
aspect
of
this
case
i
don't
understand,
and
maybe
you
can
explain
it.
there
was
a
question
about
what
might
why
be
the
revenue
loss
in
--
in
the
case
of
the
wife.
should
the
revenue
loss
be
different?
convicted
of
aiding
and
abetting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
it's
not
a
criminal
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
criminal
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
--
there's
one
technical
feature,
too,
that
i
also
didn't
understand.
the
particular
tax
here
in
question,
the
failure
to
report
was
76-some
thousand
dollars,
but
the
number
that
was
given
for
the
total
failure
to
report
is
over
$1
million,
and
the
--
the
loss
to
the
irs
at
--
is
$245,000.
so
the
$245,000
loss
must
refer
to
more
than
the
failure
to
report
$76,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
just
like
to
know
how
we
got
--
how
the
$245,000
revenue
loss
was
calculated,
given
that
the
crime
that
was
charged,
the
failure
was
to
report
only
$76,000?
