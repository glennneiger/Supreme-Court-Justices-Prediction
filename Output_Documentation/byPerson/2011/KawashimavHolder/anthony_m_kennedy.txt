that

"whoever

so
that
is
not
correct.
well,
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
it
would
seem
to
me
just
from
reading
the
statute,
unless
we
have
some
gloss
on,
that
if
you
think
it's
true
but
it's
false,
from
the
way
you
were
indicating,
would
be
a
violation.
that's
not
the
way
i
read
it.
now,
have
we
said
something
other
than
that
in
later
cases?
