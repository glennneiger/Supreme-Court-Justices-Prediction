how
would
you
prove
fraud
and
deceit
beyond
proving
that
the
person
lied,
intentionally
lied?
what
is
added
to
intentionally
lying
to
convert
that
into
fraud
or
deceit?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
intentionally
lying
--
doesn't
that
mean
that
you
intend
to
deceive?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
that
it's
false
when
you
say
it.
isn't
that
what
willfully
means?
you
must
know
that
the
statement
you
are
making
is
false.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
another
adverb.
i
want
you
to
describe
what
it
means
in
the
context
of
a
statement.
doesn't
it
mean
that
you
have
to
know
that
the
statement
you
are
making
is
false.
isn't
that
enough
for
willfulness?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
you
tell
me
what
deceit
involves
beyond
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
the
text
of
it?
i
don't
like
counsel
getting
up
here
and
talking
about
statutes
that
they've
never
put
before
us.
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
it,
we
--
we
would
like
to
have
the
text
somewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why?
because
it
wouldn't
be
pointless
if
in
fact
an
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat
tax
does
not
require
a
lie,
does
not
require
a
willful
lie.
it
would
be
adding
to
the
--
to
the
fraud
and
deceit
offenses,
7201,
which
does
not
require
a
lie.
it
just
requires,
you
know,
going
to
cuba
and
writing
postcards
saying,
i
know
i
owe
money,
i
just
ain't
gonna
pay
it.
there
is
no
fraud
and
deceit
there.
it's
just
what
7201
requires,
an
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
that's
my
very
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
without
lying
--
without
lying
--
without
making
a
single
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
and
my
point
is
that
it
would
not
have
been
included
within
(m)(i).
there
is
no
way
that
it
could
be
included
with
(m)(i),
because
it
does
not
involve
or
deceit.
it
does
not
involve
a
lie,
as
7206
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
an
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat:
"who
willfully
attempts
in
any
manner
to
evade
or
defeat
any
tax.
"
and
one
can
do
that
without
lying.
one
can
do
that
by
simply
not
report
income,
for
example.
or
in
--
in
justice
breyer's
more
colorful
example,
by
going
to
cuba.
was
it
cuba
or
somewhere
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
just
not
filing
returns?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
confused
by
the
$10,000
requirement.
does
that
have
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
the
consequence
of
the
fraud
or
deceit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
still
wouldn't
--
no.
they
still
wouldn't
be
tax
offenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
use
the
mail
to
avoid
--
still,
what
you
are
being
prosecuted
for
is
use
of
the
mail
to
defraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
put
it
wrong.
he
should
have
said
--
just
tax
statutes
are
covered.
then
--
then
you
wouldn't
have
to
bifurcate,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
just
that.
it's
--
it's
also
that
--
that
(m)(i)
says
loss
to
the
victim
or
victims.
and
(m)(ii)
says
the
revenue
loss
to
i
mean,
in
one
one
--
the
government
has
to
exceed
$10,000.
case,
it's
the
loss
to
the
victim
or
victims.
why
did
that
use
parallel
language?
why
--
or
why
did
it
say
an
--
an
offense
that
involves
--
an
offense
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victim
or
victims
exceeds
$10,000
and
one
involves
fraud
or
deceit;
or
two,
is
described
in
section
7201
of
title
26?
i
mean,
if
--
if
you
read
it,
it
seems
to
contrast
loss
to
the
victim
or
victims
with
revenue
loss
to
the
government.
and
i
find
it
hard
to
regard
the
government
as
a
victim
in
any
of
these
cases,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
