i'm
sorry,
but
i'm
a
little
bit
lost
here.
your
definition
of
deceit
is
a
false
statement
with
an
intent
for
the
other
party
to
rely.
and
you
don't
see
that
when
you
file
your
tax
returns
that
the
government
is
relying
on
your
statement
to
calculate
your
tax
and
to
ensure
that
you've
paid
it?
you
don't
see
any
reliance
by
the
government
on
the
truthful
statements
there,
and
its
collection
of
taxes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
also
had
to
prove
that
the
government
relied?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
not
even
sure
why,
because
under
tax
evasion
you
can
be
charged
with
tax
evasion
merely
for
avoiding
the
payment
of
tax.
you
don't
have
to
make
a
statement
at
all.
you
can
take
the
money
from
the
bank,
withdraw
it
openly,
and
stick
it
in
your
mattress,
refuse
to
pay,
and
if
somehow
they
find
your
mattress
you
can
be
charged
with
tax
evasion.
where
is
the
falsehood
and
deceit
in
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
there's
a
--
if
there
are
cases
that
say
otherwise,
what
does
that
do
to
your
argument?
of
which
there
are
many
that
say
that
the
avoidance
of
taxes,
tax
payment,
doesn't
require
an
act
of
fraud
or
deceit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
are
there
any
tax
provisions
that
you
think
are
not
covered
by
the
fraud
and
deceit
section
and
the
tax
evasion
section?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
any
tax
crime.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
felonies,
i
should
say.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
fall
under
tax
evasion
or
that's
a
separate
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
cut
you
off.
which
are
the
other
ones?
