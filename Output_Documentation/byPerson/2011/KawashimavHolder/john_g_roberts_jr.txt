counsel,
what

your
answer
to
your
friend's
6501(c)(i)
argument?
chief

roberts,

well,
no,
but
i
think
your
friend's
argument,
which
had
some
appeal,
is
7206
is
fraud
and
false
statements.
and
he
said
if
you're
right
that
that
includes
deceit,
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
add
"with
the
intent
to
evade
tax.
"
which
is
what
they
do
in
6501(c)(1).
