mr.
gannon,
do
you
think
that
you
can
commit
tax
evasion
without
committing
either
fraud
or
deceit,
and
are
there
cases
that
show
that?
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
i
suppose
what
confuses
me
is
when
somebody
is
convicted
of
7201,
they
can't
--
they
are
estopped
from
contesting
a
civil
fraud
suit,
isn't
that
right?
and
it
also
counts
as
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude,
which
involves
fraud.
and
all
of
those
things
suggest,
and
i
think
kind
of
the
cases
as
a
whole
suggest,
that
tax
evasion
involves
fraud.
justice
elena
kagan
counsel,
what
if
you
do--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
scharton
was
a
very
old
case
which
had
been
distinguished
away
by
many
courts.
this
really
has
no
power
in
the
--
in
the
--
i
mean,
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
mean,
the
paradoxical
thing
about
your
argument
is
that
one,
it
makes
us
think
that
congress
was
just
being
hypervigilant
about
this
problem
of
making
sure
that
tax
evasion
offenses
were
covered,
even
though
tax
evasion
offenses
almost
always
do
involve
fraud
or
deceit,
but
congress
was
thinking
about
these
hypothetical
possibilities
that
maybe
there
was
going
to
be
some
conviction
out
there
that
would
not
involve
fraud
or
deceit,
and
so
congress
is
being
super-careful
about
this.
and
yet
at
the
same
time
that
congress
is
being
utterly
careless,
utterly
clueless
about
the
basic
rule
of
statutory
construction
which
is
that
one
does
not
write
superfluous
language.
justice
elena
kagan
so
our
rule
of
statutory
construction
when
it
comes
to
this
aggravated
felony
statute
is
that
superfluity
doesn't
matter?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
make
sure,
mr.
gannon,
that
i
understand
your
argument
about
superfluidity?
because
when
i
asked
whether
(m),
the
second
provision
was
superfluous,
you
pointed
me
to
the
evasion
of
payment
cases.
and
you
cite
two
of
them.
but
then
you
say
even
those
cases
will
almost
invariably
involve
some
affirmative
acts
of
fraud.
so
are
there,
in
fact,
any
cases,
evasion
of
payment
or
otherwise,
which
do
not
involve
some
affirmative
acts
of
fraud?
justice
elena
kagan
a
factual
matter
argument.
justice
elena
kagan
and
that's
what
i'm
asking.
as
a
factual
matter,
can
you
point
me
to
any
cases
that
do
not
involve
affirmative
acts
of
fraud?
justice
elena
kagan
i
know,
but
we
have
a
very
and
active
irs
which
prosecutes
lots
of
tax
cases,
and
you
are
saying
that
it
just
never
prosecutes
tax
cases
under
this
section
that
don't
involve
affirmative
acts
of
fraud.
justice
elena
kagan
and
that
makes
me
wonder
why
congress
was
so
worried
about
this
problem
that
it
ignored
normal
rules
of
statutory
interpretation.
justice
elena
kagan
but
it
would
have
been
perfectly
easy
for
congress
to
write
a
provision
which
said
just
in
case
that
--
you
know,
just
in
case
this
decision
called
scharton
has
any
effect,
we
mean
tax
evasion,
too,
without
writing
it
in
this
way
that
appears
to
exclude
all
other
tax
offenses.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
just
arguing
against
our
application
of
the
normal
rule
of
avoiding
superfluidity
where
we
can.
