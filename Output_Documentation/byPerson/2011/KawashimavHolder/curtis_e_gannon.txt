mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress's
specific
reference
to
tax
evasion
in
subparagraph
(m)(ii)
of
the
ina's
definition
of
aggravated
felony
did
not
remove
all
other
tax
offenses
from
the
scope
of
subparagraph
(m)(i).
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
34
that
discuss
this
are
ones
that
are
evasion
of
payment
cases
as
opposed
to
evasion
of
assessment
cases.
and
those
--
those
are
instances
in
which
somebody
could
accurately
file
a
tax
return
and
say
i
owe
you
this
amount
of
money
and
then
take
steps
to
prevent
the
irs
from
collecting
on
it,
usually
by
removing
their
assets
from
the
irs's
reach.
as
a
factual
matter,
it
so
happens
that
most
of
those
cases
will
often
involve
some
concealment
along
the
way.
if
somebody's
taking
more
than
$10,000
in
gold
coins
out
of
the
country
to
take
them
to
a
swiss
bank,
they
often
don't
mention
that
when
they
are
leaving
the
country.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
just
not
filing
a
return
is
probably
not
going
to
be
enough
to
establish
tax
evasion.
that
would
be
an
offense
under
7203,
which
doesn't
necessarily
involve
fraud
or
deceit.
the
thing
that
distinguishes
7201
is
the
need
for
the
government
to
establish
that
there
is
an
attempt
to
evade
either
the
assessment
or
payment
of
taxation.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
certainly
in
the
context
of
the
civil
tax
fraud
penalty,
the
tax
court
has
concluded
that
intent
to
evade
is
synonymous
with
an
understatement
due
to
fraud.
and
the
reason
why
it
has
refused
to
reach
that
conclusion
in
the
context
of
7206
offenses,
like
the
ones
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
because
the
7206
offense
does
not
require
the
government
to
prove
that
there
was
any
understatement
to
begin
with,
and
so
there
could
not
have
been
an
understatement
due
to
fraud.
i'd
also
note
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
in
the
context
of
the
evasion
of
payment
cases
that
i
was
just
discussing
in
the
context
of
tax
evasion,
that
the
same
civil
tax
fraud
penalty
would
be
applicable
there,
because
the
civil
tax
fraud
penalty
is
triggered
by
an
understatement
of
an
amount
required
to
be
shown
on
the
return.
and
therefore
if
it
is
--
if
it
isn't
actually
something
that
is
done
in
the
context
of
filing
a
tax
return
that
understates
how
much
you
owe
the
government,
then
--
then
that
may
well
not
trigger
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
the
follow-on
civil
case.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
you
mean--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--any
tax
crime--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--there
are
several
tax
offenses
that
don't
necessarily
involve
fraud
or
deceit.
so
parts
of
7202,
which
is
the
willful
failure
to
collect
tax,
would
not
necessarily
involve
fraud
and
deceit,
but
it
also
covers
failing
to
truthfully
account
for
collected
tax.
so
some
of
those
offenses
would
involve
fraud
or
deceit
and
it
may
be
divisible.
7203,
which
i
just
mentioned--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's
not
tax
evasion.
the
only
thing
that
counts
as
tax
evasion
is
7201.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
was
saying
that
i
already
mentioned
to
justice
scalia
that
section
7203,
all
of
these
offenses
i'm
talking
about,
are
in
26
u.s.c.
7203,
the
willful
failure
to
file
a
return
or
to
pay
tax
or
maintain
records
or
supply
information
doesn't
necessarily
involve
fraud
or
deceit.
parts
of
7204,
which
is
failing
to
furnish
a
statement
to
the
employee
reflecting
the
amount
of
taxes,
but
not
--
but
then
again,
i
think
it
could
be
divisible
because
it
would
also
apply
to
furnishing
a
false
statement
to
your
employee.
even
the
misdemeanor
offense
under
7207
for
presenting
false
documents
might
be
covered
for
fraud
or
deceit,
but
in
practice
it's
only
used
when
there's
--
it's
only
used
when
the
tax
deficiencies
are
de
minimis.
and
so
it
would
never
trigger
the
$10,000
loss
requirement
that
(m)(i)
would
also
require
us
to
establish
in
order
to
make
it
an
aggravated
felony.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
my
answer
is
that
i
don't
think
it
proves
really
any
more
than
the
collateral
estoppel
cases
in
the
civil
fraud
context
the
provision
that
we're
talking
about
is
not
reprinted
in
any
of
the
briefs,
but
6501(c)(1)
is
an
exception
that
--
that
lifts
the
limitation
on
when
the
irs
can
levy
an
assessment
or
seek
collection;
and
it
refers
to
the
case
of
a
false
or
fraudulent
return
with
the
intent
to
evade
tax.
and
i
think
that
in
context,
the
reference
to
a
false
or
fraudulent
return
with
intent
to
evade
tax
is
not
something
that
clearly
connotes
that
congress
is
just
speaking
to
7206
offenses.
it
uses
not
only
the
word
fraudulent,
but
also
the
intent
to
evade
tax,
which
i
think--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
--
i
think
if
you
look
to
(c)(2)
it
also
refers
to
a
willful
attempt
in
any
manner
to
defeat
or
evade
tax.
so
the
next
provision
also
applies
more
broadly
to
7201
and
more
closely
tracks
the
definition
in
7201.
so
i
think
just
like
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
that
we
note,
congress
is
probably
using
a
belt
and
suspenders
approach
there.
that
we
noted
that
congress
may
well
have
had
reason
to
be
concerned
that
7201
offenses
would
not
necessarily
be
seen
as
having
fraud
or
deceit
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
scharton,
which
was
an
old
case
but
it
had
said
that
in
the
--
in
the
statute
of
limitations
context,
that
the
--
the
extended
statute
of
limitations
that
apply
to
offenses
in
which
fraud
was
an
element,
was
not
triggered
by
the
statutory
predecessor
to
tax
evasion.
and
so
to
the
--
stop--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
to
this
day
section
6531,
which
is
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
which
we
do
reprint
in
our
appendix,
includes
provisions
that
refer
not
only
generally
to
offenses
involving
fraud
but
also
specifically
to
a
tax
evasion
offense.
and
so
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
had
already
felt
like
it
needed
to
be
expressed,
to
pull
in
not
just
fraud
offenses
but
also
tax
evasion
offenses
in
6531,
makes
it
unsurprising
that
they
would
have
pursued
a
similar
approach
here.
in
addition
i
would--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--but
justice
kagan,
we
don't
think
it's
superfluous,
in
part
because
of
the
evasion
of
payment
cases
we
are
talking
about,
but
i
think
also
if
you
look
at
the
context
of
the
rest
of
paragraph
43,
the
aggravated
felony
definition,
you'll
see
that
there
are
several
other
provisions
that
have
significant
overlap
in
them.
and
so
subparagraph
(a)
refers
to
murder
and
rape;
those
would
also
generally
be
covered
in
crimes
of
violence
in
subparagraph
(f).
the
same
thing
is
true
in
paragraph
(e)(i);
it
pulls
in
various
explosive
offenses
including
arson,
destruction
of
property
or
building
by
fire
or
explosives;
that
is
the
reference
to
an
8441--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--no,
justice
kagan,
i
think
that
offense.
in
context,
there
is
a
lot
of
overlap
among
the
different
provisions
in
--
in
paragraph
43
already,
and
i
--
i
was
also
going
to
mention
subparagraph
(k)(i)
and
(ii),
which
like
(m)(i)
and
(m)(ii)
are
ones
that
have
little
(i),
which
has
a
generic
reference
there
to
offenses
associated
with
managing
a
prostitution
business,
and
little
(ii)
then
expressly
refers
to
certain
enumerated
federal
statutes,
all
of
which
involve
transporting
individuals
for
purposes
of
prostitution
in
the
case
of
seeking
commercial
advantage.
and
i
think
that
virtually
all
of
those
offenses
would
have
been
included
within
(k)(i)
but
congress
wanted
to
be
sure
and
therefore
added
(k)(ii);
and
as
--
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
i
think
before,
textually
it
--
it
had
reason
to
think
that
7206
would
be
picked
up
by
fraud
or
deceit
here--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
reason
why
we
don't
think
that's
appropriate
is
in
part
because
as
i
have
explained
there
--
there
is
some
aspect
of
which
(m)(ii)
is
not
superfluous.
but
more
importantly,
we
don't
think
the
specific
controls
that
general
cannon
has
triggered
here
--
and
we
don't
think
that
(m)(ii)
talks
about
a
category
of
tax
crimes
or
tax
offenses
more
generally,
because
it
only
refers
to
one
offense.
and
so
the
cases
that
petitioners
invoke
here
in
order
to
establish
that
there
is
a
category
that
is
being
pulled
out
of
(m)(i)
are
hcsc-laundry
and
leocal.
those
are
both
cases
in
which
the
statute
actually
identified
the
category
of
offenses
in
question,
whether
it
was
the
cooperative
hospital
service
organizations
in
hcsc-laundry
or
dui
offenses
in
leocal.
and
so
here
we
don't
have
congress
actually
saying
tax
offenses
are
covered
by
(m)(ii).
what
it
says
is
tax
evasion
is
covered
by
(m)(ii).
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
common
law
definitions
of
fraud
and
deceit
are
the
ones
that
this
court
has
always
applied
in
the
context--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
the
criminal
context
the
court
has
recognized
that
fraud
offenses
don't
require
the
government
to
prove
reliance
or
damages,
and
that
makes
sense.
if
you
think
about
the
tort
action,
the
classic
tort
action
you
would
need
to
be
an
injured
plaintiff,
and
therefore
you
would
need
to
be
able
to
say
i
relied
on
this
to
my
detriment.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
do
not
have
to
prove
as
a
separate
element
that
there
is
reliance
or
intended
reliance
here,
but
we
do
need
to
prove
what
we
think
satisfies
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term
deceit.
we
are
not
focusing
on
fraud
here
but
deceit,
and
that's
the
act
of
intentionally
giving
a
false
impression,
because
the
elements
of
this
offense
are
making
and
signing
a
return
under
the
penalty
of
perjury
that
it
is
false
in
a
material
manner,
that
the
defendant
does
not--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--does
not
believe
to
be
true
or
correct,
and
it's
all
done
willfully.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
that
--
that's
right,
and
we
think
here
congress
has
used
the
--
the
term--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
congress
did
use
the
terms
disjunctively
here,
and
i
think
that
the
--
now
the
plain
meaning
of
deceit
it
sort
of
operates
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
one
you
are
talking
about,
justice
breyer.
and
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
court
in
yermian
discuss
the
difference
between
an
intent
to
defraud
and
intent
to
deceive,
it
talks
about
an
intent
to
fraud
includes
actually
obtaining
something
whereas
intent
to
deceive
just
involves
creating
a
false
impression.
and
so
i
think
that
actually
the
difference
can
run
the
other
direction
in
a
way
that
supports
the
definition
that
we
are
relying
on
here.
but
going
back
to
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
about
this
not
ruling
out
all
tax
offenses,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
reference
to
7201
alone
doesn't
do,
that
nor
do
we
think
the
fact
that
congress
then
added
a
limited
--
limiting
language
that
said
that
when
the
revenue
loss
exceeds
$10,000,
it
would
satisfy
(m)(ii).
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
that
is
a
factual
matter,
justice
kagan.
we
were--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
were
observing
that
as
a
factual
matter,
those
evasion-of-payment
cases
probably
would
not
happen
without
there
being
acts
of
concealment.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
don't
believe
that
i
can,
but
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
has
looked
into
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
7201,
if
they
are
talking
about
evasion
of
payment,
that
will
not
necessarily
require
deceptive
acts
of
concealment.
so
that's
the
reason--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well
--
and
i
believe
that
the
reason
that
they
were
worried
could
be
because
of
the
scharton
decision
which
this
court
had
already
said
that
evasion
does
not
necessarily
require
fraud
because
the
textual
cues
in
7201
are
much
further
from
fraud
and
deceit
than
those
in
7206,
that
there's
also
--
there
would
be
less
certainty,
even
assuming
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
established
practice
at
the
federal
level
of
having
7201
tax
evasion
cases
be
compared
with
fraud,
this
is
also
a
provision
that
applies
to
state
and
foreign
offenses.
the
penultimate
sentence
of
paragraph
43
says
that
the
term
applies
to
an
offense
whether
it's
in
violation
of
federal
state
law.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
that
may
well
be
the
consequence
of
the
definition
that
congress
has
adopted
here
of
aggravated
felony.
and
i
would
note
in
the
plea
agreement
that
mr.
kawashima
filed
in
this
case,
paragraph
4,
which
is
reprinted
on
117
a
of
the
petition
appendix
says:
"mr.
kawashima
recognizes
that
he
may
be
that's
in
his
and
so
it
is,
deported
as
a
result
of
his
conviction.
"
plea
agreement
to
the
7206
offense
here.
to
be
sure,
the
case
that
the
government
may
well
find
it
more
difficult
to
secure
guilty
pleas
when
an
alien
is
admitting
to
an
offense
that
is
an
aggravated
felony.
but
we
think
that
that's
a
consequence
of
congress
having
expanded
the
definition.
in--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--congress
has
given
us
two
different
metrics
of
determining
whether
those,
whether
those
offenses
are
aggravated
felonies.
if
they
involve
fraud
or
deceit
and
there
is
loss
to
the
victim
exceeding
$10,000,
then
that
it
could
fall
within
--
and
when
it
is
perjury
statute
that
doesn't
involve
loss
or
false
statements
to
an
fbi
agent
that
doesn't
involve
loss
to--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
the
beginning
when
of
the
i
think
most
perjury
amount
of
loss
was
$200,000.
offenses
do
not
involve
the
loss
of
$200,000--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--there
--
yes,
there
are
such
sometimes
they
go
under
(s),
which
is
the
paragraph
for
perjury,
which
was
actually
not
in
existence
when
(m)(i)
was
added
to
the
statute.
added
two
years
later.
it
was
but
more
generally,
i
would
like
to
mention
that
there
are
other
tax
offenses
--
justice
scalia.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
does
not
need
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense.
the
consequence
of
the
court's
decision
in--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
needs
to
be
tied
to
the
offensive
conviction,
under
this
court's
decision
in
ninja.
in
most
instances
where
somebody
lies
to
an
fbi
agent,
probably
don't
involve
costing
somebody
more
than
$10,000.
and
so
i
think
that
it
doesn't
often
come
up
in
(m)(i).
but
many
other
tax
offenses
are
prosecuted
under
other
provisions
that
potentially
involve
fraud
or
deceit
and
could
cost
the
government

than

and
petitioner's
reading
of
saying
that
all
tax
offenses
have
to
be
pulled
into
(m)(ii)
and
only
tax
evasion
is
covered
would
require
the
court
to
bifurcate
all
of
these
other
provisions.

and
i'm
thinking
of,
for
this
is
the
provision
for
defrauding
the
united
states
by
obstructing
or
impeding
the
irs
in
its
efforts
to
collect
taxation.
this
court
cited
371
as
one
of
the
fraud
offenses
that
it
thought
was
covered
by
(m)(i)
in
the
nijhawan
decision.
same
is
true
for
mail
fraud.
the
the
criminal
division,
the
tax
division
can
prosecute
tax
cases
in
which
somebody
mails
a
false
tax
return

under

u.s.c.
287;
conspiracy

claims
under
286;
false
statements
to
the
government,
these
are
all
provisions
that
are
used
to
prosecute
tax
offenses.
and
petitioner's
reading
of
saying
that
all
tax
crimes
are
culled
out
would
require
the
court
to
bifurcate
these
offenses
and
make
whether
it's
an
aggravated
felony
turn
on
whether
the
government
has
lost
revenue
as
opposed
to
some
other
form
of
money.
and
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
congress
intended
when
it
went
to
the
trouble
of
just
stating
that
tax
evasion
was
expressly
covered.
and
going
back,
justice
kagan,
to
your
concerns
about
superfluidity,
i
do
think
it's
important
that
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
there's
lots
of
other
overlap.
congress
had
reasons
to
be
unsure.
in
light
of
the
scharton
decision,
in
light
of
the
evasion-of-payment
cases
because
even
though
as
a
factual
matter--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
don't
see
how
--
if
congress
wanted
to
exclude
all
other
tax
offenses,
i
think
they
should
have
put
that
exception
in
(m)(i).
have
said:
they
should
offenses
involving
fraud
or
deceit,
but
not
tax
offenses,
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victim
or
victims
exceeds
$10,000.
if
congress
wanted
to
make
an
exception
tax
offenses--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
yes.
i
agree
that
the
court
avoids
superfluidity
where
it
can.
contextual
reasons
to
think
that
congress
was
just
trying
to
add
more
offenses
to
the
definition
rather
than
rule
out
an
entire
class.
and
i
also
think
that
there
is
no
way
to
avoid
the
consequence
of
bifurcating
all
of
those
other
provisions
under
petitioner's
reading.
and
so
if
you
were
to
say
that
the
reference
to
7201
pulls
out
all
revenue
loss
offenses,
that
would
mean
that
some
mail
fraud
cases
against
the
government
in
which
the
government
loses
more
than
$10,000
count
and
some
don't.
statements.
same
for
wire
fraud.
same
for
false
same
for
false
claims,
conspiracy
to
false
claims,
and
client
conspiracies
under
section
371
which,
which
are
--
have
a
great
deal
of
overlap.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
they
would
be--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--but
the
--
i
mean,
as
i
understand
petitioner's
argument,
it
is
the
fact
that
(m)(ii)
refers
to
revenue
loss
that
is
the
thing
that
makes
it
pull
in
or
define
a
category
of
cases
involving
tax
offenses.
and
i
think
that
if
a
mail
fraud
offense
against
the
government
involved
taking
--
getting
more
than
$10,000
worth
of
refunds
from
the
government
as
opposed
to
getting
more
than
$10,000
in
an
ill-gotten
government
contract
or
government
benefits
from
the
government,
that
that
could
still
be
characterized
as
revenue
loss.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
then
--
i
just
don't
see
how
the
reference
to
a
single
provision
of
7201
refers
to
all
other
tax
provisions--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--none
of
the
courts
of
appeals
has
had
any
difficulty
concluding
that
the
government
is
a
victim
when
it
loses
more
than
$10,000
in
a
fraud
case,
or
indeed
in
a
tax
evasion
case.
so
here,
there
is
a
different
phrase,
but
i
think
what's
important
is
that
7201
doesn't
define
a
class
of
revenue
loss
offenses.
offenses.
instead,
it
defines
a
class
of
tax
evasion
it
only
refers
to
the
one
statute.
and
--
and
then
in
that
context,
where
there
has
to
be
a
deficiency
in
order
to
--
for
there
to
be
a
7201
conviction,
there
must
be
a
tax
deficiency.
then
it
is
natural
to
talk
about
the
relevant
losses
being
revenue
loss
to
the
government.
the
phrase
in
(m)(i)
is
broader
because
it
also
applies
to
other
types
of
frauds.
and
i
think
that
the
reference
to
7201
alone
doesn't
indicate
congress
is
intending
to
weed
out
all
tax
offenses.
as
justice
ginsburg
mentioned
before,
although
7201
has
a
5-year
maximum
statutory
penalty,
which
is
longer
than
the
3-year
maximum
that
applies
under
7206
and
some
of
the
other
tax
offenses
in
that
particular
chapter
of
title
26,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
--
the
sentencing
guidelines
use
the
same
thing.
the
--
the
same
criteria
that
are
both
tied
to
loss.
and
more
importantly,
a
lot
of
these
other
offenses,
like
371
and
1341
and
1343
in
title
18
actually
have
longer
maximum
punishments.
so
if
the
government
wants
--
has
a
particularly
big
fraud
that
they
want
to
--
to
get
after
somebody
who
has
a
tax
evasion
case
in
which
they've
cost
the
government
a
great
deal
of
money
--
it
may
choose
to
proceed
under
one
of
the
other
provisions
where
it
can
get
an
even
greater
punishment.
and
so
just
referring
to
7201
as
the
capstone
i
don't
think
allows
it
to
be
a
stand-in
for
all
other
tax
offenses.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
she
--
although
it
--
the
statute
itself
refers
to
aiding,
assisting,
procuring
or
advising,
it's
not
a
traditional
aiding
and
abetting
statute.
it
doesn't
require
there
to
be
an
underlying
primary
violation.
it's
an
independent
offense.
and
so
as
it
happens
in
this
case,
we
all
know
and
it
is
not
disputed
that
therefore,
the
same
underlying
false
tax
return,
the
same
tax
return
that
ended
in
1991
for
one
of
the
corporations
that
petitioners
co-owned,
but
--
but
we
just
didn't
have
that
evidence
in
the
record.
and
so,
i
--
i
think
even
though
it's
an
aiding
and
abetting,
it's
not
a
classic
aiding
and
abetting
violation
that
depends
on
the
--
the
husband's
conviction.
she
could
have
been
convicted
under
7206,
too,
even
if
the
husband
didn't
know
anything
about
the
false
numbers
that
she
was
providing
him
from
the
restaurant
that
they
were
operating.
so
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
