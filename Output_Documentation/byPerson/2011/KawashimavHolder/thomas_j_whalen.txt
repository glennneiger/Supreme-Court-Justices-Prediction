mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
and
mrs.
kawashima
came
here
to
the
united
states
as
legal
immigrants
in
1985.
and
later
on
they
pled
guilty
to
filing
a
false
statement
under
a
corporate
tax
return.
the
issue
we
bring
to
the
court
is
whether
that
conviction
under
26
u.s.c.
7206
is
an
aggravated
felony,
specifically
under
(m)(i)
of
the
aggravated
felony
statute.
this
court
many
times
has
held
that
it
is
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
conviction
that
determine
whether
a
crime
is
an
aggravated
felony.
and
the
elements
of
7206
do
not
change
when
they
go
over
to
the
immigration
statute.
and
the
terms
of
that
statute
is
basically
as
the
department
of
justice
has
written
in
its
tax
manual.
it
is
basically
a
tax
perjury
statute.
if
you
don't
tell
the
truth,
and
you
know
what
you
are
saying
is
false,
and
you
do
it
under
oath,
that's
perjury.
there
are
other
statutes,
perjury
statutes,
which
in
essence
say
the
same
thing.
and
18
u.s.c.
1001
is
also
a
perjury
statute.
and
none
of
them
require
the
justice
department
or
a
court
to
determine
whether
fraud
and
deceit
was
an
element
of
that
crime.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
it's
the
intention
to
deceive
or
the
intention
to
defraud.
and
simply--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
it
does
not
mean,
because
you
are
saying
a
false
--
making
a
false
statement,
that
that
is
evidence
of
an
intent
to
deceive.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
justice
ginsburg,
the
difference
i'm
trying
to
ask
the
court
to
consider,
it
is
the
intent
which
is
an
element
of
fraud
and
deceit.
under
section
7201,
the
tax
evasion
statute,
that
includes
both
a
requirement
or
a
finding
of
fraud
and
deceit.
section
7206
does
not.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
because
the
requirements,
your
honor,
of
7206
is
a
finding
of
--
of
simply
making
a
false
statement.
that's
all
that's
required.
the
irs,
when
they
go
after
a
taxpayer
because
they
have
not
provided
--
they
have
not
disclosed
all
of
their
income,
the
irs
comes
in,
or
rather
the
department
of
justice,
and
all
they
have
to
prove
is
that
it's
false.
they
don't
have
to
prove--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor,
but
as
this
court--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--if
i
may,
your
honor.
this
court
has
written
in
the
spies
case,
and
specifically
in
the
bishop
case,
that
in
order
to
be
convicted
of
any
tax
offense
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
irs
or
the
department
of
justice
must
show
it
was
done
willfully.
willfully
is
not
intrinsic
to
any
--
it's
really
intrinsic
to
all
of
the
tax
offenses.
willfully
does
not
mean
deceit
or
fraud.
it
simply
means
that
the
irs
cannot
bring
a
criminal
information
or
indictment
against
somebody
who
does
something
unintentionally.
they
must
do
it
willfully.
willfully,
as
this
court
defined
in
bishop,
is
simply
evidence
that
--
to
commit
any
of
these
irs
crimes
you
must
--
it
must
be
shown
to
have
been
done
willfully.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
willfully
means
intentionally.
the
false,
i
submit--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
deceit
involves
an
intention
to
induce
somebody
to
act.
and
what
i'm
arguing
to
this
court
is
that
simply
making
a
false
statement
under
a
tax
perjury
statute
such
as
we
have
in
this
case
does
not
meaning
and
does
not
evidence
an
intention
to
deceive
or
a
finding.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
--
i
do
say
reliance
is
generally
is
what
happens.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
7206
is
a
perjury
statute
and
the
government
does
not
have
to
prove,
and
did
not
have
to
prove
in
this
case
anything
more
than
the
--
the
--
the
income
was
unreported
or
the
tax
--
the
tax
return
was
false.
if--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--i'm
saying
that
the
government
--
if
the
government
wanted
to
prove
fraud
or
deceit,
they
--
that
would
be
an
element
of
the
crime
of
tax
evasion,
72--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--the
government
would
have
to
prove
fraud
or
deceit,
because
an
intent
to
evade
is
--
the
court
--
the
--
the
government
has
to
prove--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--i
would
be
surprised
by
those--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--then
the
government
would
bring
an
action
under
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--what's
wrong
with
it,
your
honor,
is
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
aggravated
felony
statute.
and
the
issue
--
and
it
may
be
a
narrow
one
for
this
court
--
is
whether
the
conviction
under
7206,
which
does
not
require
anything
more
than
filing
of
a
false
statement
without
any
intent
to
deceive
or
defraud
--
whether
that
is
an
aggravated
felony.
and
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
it's
the
elements
of
the
offense
that
determines
aggravated
felony.
if
i
may
illustrate
the
point,
if
--
if
a
conviction
under
7206
was
viewed
by
this
court
as
including
fraud
and
deceit
for
the
reasons
many
of
the
justices
have
indicated,
that,
you
know,
that
when
somebody
writes
a
false
tax
return,
it's
got
to
be
deceit,
what
that
does
is
that
would
collaterally
estop
a
taxpayer
from
denying
fraud
and
deceit
in
the
civil
collection
action.
so
this
is
what
commissioner
walters
was
concerned
about,
why
he
has
filed
his
brief,
that
it
in
effect
would
undermine
the
ability
of
the
government
to
get
an
easy
conviction
based
simply
on
a
false
statement.
similarly,
if
you
are
convicted
of
tax
evasion,
the
--
the
tax
evader
cannot
challenge
fraud.
he
is
collaterally
estopped.
and
as
we
know,
when
the
government
goes
to
seek
recovery,
that
is
getting
the
taxes
back
in
a
civil
proceeding,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
the
intention
of
congress
is
also
reflected
in
the
internal
revenue
code
section
6501,
where
if
a
person
is
convicted
under
7206
and
the
government
seeks
to
collect
the
unpaid
taxes
in
an
assessment
proceeding,
congress
particularly
said
that
where
there
is
a
conviction
under
7206,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
fraud,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
evidence
--
or
rather,
the
government
has
the
--
a
duty
to
prove
there
was
an
attempt
to
evade
the
tax.
but
the
conclusion
is
the
same.
if
congress
had
intended
that
proof
of
fraud
and
deceit
would
be
in
7206,
there
would
be
no
reason
at
all
for
congress
to
put
that
in
70
--
6501.
therefore--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--yes.
to
be
more
precise,
6501(c)(1).
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
the
exceptions
to
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
have
it
in
my
reply
brief.
i
don't
have
the
particular
statute,
but
i
refer
to
it
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes.
i
apologize
for
that,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
move
to
the
second
part
of
my
argument,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
--
this
court
has
been
very
clear
on
deciding
statutes
invoking
the
canons
of
construction.
and
one
of
the
important
canons
is
that
different
words
have
different
meanings.
so
in
(m)(i),
we
have
loss
to
victim
or
victims
in
excess
of
$10,000.
and
in
(m)(ii),
we
have
a
revenue
loss
to
the
government
in
excess
of
10,000.
and
as
this
court
said
in
nijhawan,
referring
to
(m)(ii),
this
is
the
internal
revenue
provision,
a
correct
assessment,
i
suggest,
and
that
(m)(i)
deals
with
injuries
or
damage
to
third
parties,
not
to
the
government.
if
you
take
the
government's
position
that
fraud
and
deceit
crimes
are
in
--
fraud
and
deceit
revenue
crimes
are
in
(m)(i),
then
(m)(ii)
would
be
worthless
or
pointless.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
anyone
who
leaves
the
country
with
an
intent
to
avoid
tax
is
committing
tax
evasion.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
and
that
is--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
fraud,
such
as
you
suggest,
your
honor,
is
going
to
be
an
aggravated
felony.
it's
the
only
one
that
congress
says
--
the
only
revenue
offense.
the
only
offense
under
the
internal
revenue
code
which
congress
designated
as
an
aggravated
felony.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
tax
evasion
were
also
included
in
(m)(i),
then
congress
would
have
created
a
useless,
pointless
provision.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
7201
involves,
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--well,
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
if
your
example
is
an
example
of
fraud
and
deceit,
which
i
agree
it
is,
then
a
crime
of
fraud
and
deceit
would
not
be
in
(m)(i)
because
it
would
be
--
it
would
already
be
captured
in
(m)(i)
if
the
government's
position
was
upheld.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
would
be
a
violation
of
one
of
the
other
internal
revenue
crimes.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
if
the
government
chose
to
prove
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
evade
the
tax,
it
would.
the
internal
revenue
statute
and
crimes
all
carry
the
duty
to
--
it's
a
legal
duty
we
all
have
of
fairly
reporting
our
income,
our
deductions,
what
have
you.
it's
the
same
legal
duty
whether
it's
in
7201
or
7206.
the
difference
is
in
tax
evasion
there
must
be
proof
of
fraud
or
deceit.
that's
inherent.
from
the
beginning
of
this
country
--
rather,
the
beginning
of
the
tax
statutes,
congress
has
always
separated
revenue
statutes
from
other
crimes.
in
this
case
(m)(i)
deals
with
crimes
involving
third-parties,
(m)(ii),
deals
with
revenue
loss
crimes
to
the
government.
only
(i)
is
an
aggravated
felony.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
my
colleague
mentioned
the
yermian
case,
which
is
in
our
brief,
but
i
failed
to
present
it
to
the
court
today.
and
it's
a
very
important
case
decided
by
this
court
which
said
that
filing
a
false
statement
is
not
--
is
not
indicative,
not
evidence
of
an
intent
to
deceive.
similarly,
the
harry
bridges
case,
also
decided
by
this
court,
said
that
--
and
the
court
held
that
making
a
false
statement
about
mr.
bridges'
involvement
with
the
communist
party
is
not
evidence
of
fraud.
these
cases,
i
believe
of
this
court,
control
the
issue
that
deceit
or
fraud
is
not
an
essential
element
for
this
crime
of
conviction.
following
up
what
justice
kagan
has
said,
has
asked,
that
the
rules
--
canons
of
construction
that
the
petitioner
has
invoked,
the
rules
of
superfluities
--
again
superfluities
--
the
idea
that
a
court
must
give
cognizance
to
different
words
meaning
different
things
--
that
is,
revenue
loss
from
the
government
is
different
from
revenue
loss
to
victim
or
victims,
and
the
specific
versus
the
general.
the
answer
of
the
government
is
simply
speculation
and
conjecture
of,
among
other
things,
courts
make
the
wrong
decisions,
congress
didn't
understand
that
tax
evasion
does
involve
fraud,
and
therefore,
it
will
be
superfluous.
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
simply
that
tax
evasion
may
not
be
in
72
--
or
may
not
be
in
(m)(ii),
the
reason,
rather,
that
fraud
and
deceit
may
not
be
in
tax
evasion,
but
that
a
lesser
revenue
offense
is
in
(m)(i).
we
--
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
as
many
of
the
justices
have
indicated,
we're
not
looking
at
an
idea
of
someone
who
suffers
a
penalty
because
--
as
a
result
of
the
tax
offense.
banishment.
we
are
talking
about
and
and
we
are
talking
about
deportation.
the
statute
which
were
involved
should
be
read
in
favor,
where
congress
has
not
been
clear,
the
statute
should
be
read
in
favor
of
the
immigrant.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
this
court
in
the
fong
case
said
that
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
to
an
immigration
case.
and
the
holdings
of
this
court
have
been
consistent
that
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
to
both
criminal
cases
as
well
as
immigration
cases.
and
i
invite
the
court
to
look
at
the
cases
we
have
cited
that
the
rule
of
lenity
has
applied,
in
fact,
to
immigration
cases.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
threshold
amount
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
don't
know.
it
was
in
negotiations
between
the
government
and
the
kawashimas.
in
any
compromise
the
government
chose
only
to
charge
them
with
a
crime
under
7206
which
--
and
to
settle
on
that
basis.
as
justice
alito
has
mentioned
in
the
padilla
case
quite
emphatically,
that
attorneys
representing
immigrants
deal
with
the
government
in
order
to
avoid
deportation.
and
that
--
in
this
case
whether
the
kawashimas
had
in
fact
filed
false
returns
in
an
attempt
to
deceive,
that
was
by
the
boards,
because
the
government
and
the
taxpayer
agreed
that
their
offense
would
be
solely
7206,
which
as
you
read
the
elements,
and
you
can
read
the
justice
department
handbook
which
tells
you
what
the
elements
are,
and
it
does
not
include
fraud
and
deceit.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
--
finally
i
would
like
to
mention
one
case
which
hasn't
been
brought
up,
which
evolved
from
the
questions
by
the
justices,
and
that
is
a
third
circuit
case
which
we
cited,
nugent
--
mentioned
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
that
the
nugent
case
said
that
you
must
fulfill
both
elements,
that
is
the
perjury,
s
under
the
statute,
and
if
it's
included
in
fraud
and
deceit,
you
must
fulfill
the
elements
of
both
crimes
at
issue.
and
of
course
in
this
case,
the
kawashimas
did
not
--
were
imprisoned
for
4
months
and
did
not
meet
the
statutory
requirement
for
an
aggravated
felony
of
1
year.
but
in
any
event
i
want
--
i
would
like
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
what
we
are
dealing
here
with
is
perjury,
and
we
are
not
dealing
with
fraud
or
deceit,
as
agreed
to
by
the
government
and
the
taxpayer.
and
that,
i
suggest
to
the
court,
should
be
dispositive
in
the
decision
in
this
case.
