justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
and
mrs.
kawashima,
who
are
citizens
of
japan
and
who
are
at
lawful
permanent
residence
in
this
country,
were
both
convicted
of
federal
tax
crimes.
mr.
kawashima
was
convicted
of
knowingly
and
willfully
submitting
a
materially
false
tax
return
and
mrs.
kawashima
was
convicted
of
willfully
aiding
or
assisting
in
the
preparation
of
the
materially
false
tax
return.
an
immigration
judge
ordered
the
kawashimas
removed
from
the
united
states
on
the
ground
that
their
convictions
qualified
as
aggravated
felonies.
specifically,
the
immigration
judge
determined
that
the
convictions
involved
fraud
or
deceit
that
caused
a
loss
to
the
government
of
at
least
$10,000.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirmed
the
immigration
judge's
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
that
the
kawashima's
conviction
involved
fraud
or
deceit,
but
it
remanded
for
the
board
to
determine
whether
mrs.
kawashima's
conviction
had,
in
fact,
caused
a
loss
to
the
government
in
excess
of
$10,000.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
grants
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
remove
any
alien
who
is
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony
at
anytime
after
admission
to
this
country.
the
act
defines
an
aggravated
felony
as
among
other
things,
an
offense
that
involves
fraud
or
deceit.
to
determine
whether
an
offense
involves
fraud
or
deceit,
we
look
to
the
statute
defining
the
crime
of
conviction
rather
than
to
the
specific
facts
underlying
the
crime.
mr.
kawashima
was
convicted
of
violating
a
statute
that
states
that
anyone
who
"willfully
makes
and
subscribes
any
return
which
contains
or
is
verified
by
a
written
declaration
that
it
is
made
under
the
penalties
of
perjury,
and
which
he
does
not
believe
to
be
true
and
correct
as
to
every
material
matter,"
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony.
although,
neither
"fraud"
nor
"deceit"
is
a
formal
element
of
that
crime,
mr.
kawashima's
conviction
necessarily
involved
deceit
because
it
entailed
knowingly
and
willfully
submitting
a
tax
return
that
was
materially
false.
similarly,
mrs.
kawashima
was
convicted
of
violating
a
statute
that
declares
that
any
person
who
"willfully
aids
or
assists
in
the
preparation
or
presentation
of
a
return
which
is
fraudulent
or
as
false
as
to
any
material
matter"
has
committed
a
felony.
mrs.
kawashima's
conviction
also
necessarily
involved
deceit
because
it
entailed
knowingly
and
willfully
assisting
the
filing
of
a
materially
false
return.
by
its
plain
language,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
incorporates
a
broad
class
of
offenses
that
involved
fraud
or
deceit
within
the
definition
of
an
aggravated
felony.
we
reject
that
kawashima's
argument
that
congress
limited
the
scope
of
that
broad
language
by
stating
in
a
second
provision
that
tax
evasion
is
also
an
aggravated
felony
when
the
tax
loss
to
the
government
exceeds
$10,000.
the
kawashimas
assert
that
by
expressly
making
tax
evasion
an
aggravated
felony,
congress
implicitly
removed
all
other
tax
offenses,
including
the
kawashimas'
offenses,
from
the
category
of
crimes
involving
fraud
and
deceit.
we
disagree.
we
think
it
more
likely
that
congress
sought
to
remove
any
doubt
that's
the
serous
offense
of
tax
evasion
was
an
aggravated
felony.
moreover,
nothing
in
the
provision
for
tax
evasion
alters
the
otherwise
plain
meaning
of
crimes
involving
fraud
or
deceit.
because
the
kawashimas
are
subject
to
deportation
as
aliens
who
have
been
convicted
of
aggravated
felonies,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
breyer
and
kagan
join.
