justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
somebody
goes
--
he
goes
to
a
country
where
we
have
no
extradition
treaty,
takes
all
his
assets
and
writes
a
postcard
to
the
irs
once
a
month
saying
ha-ha-ha.
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
that
be
an
attempt
to
evade?
that's
why
he
went;
he
didn't
like
to
pay
his
taxes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
7201.
why
can't
you
--
well,
why
doesn't
that
violate
7201?
i
mean,
my
simple
question
really
is
you
are
a
drafter,
imagine
you
are
a
drafter,
and
you
are
charged
with
drafting
section
43.
and
you
read
--
try
to
get
the
fraud
and
deceit
crimes,
okay?
so
now
we
read
76
--
7206(1)
and
(2).
and
you
see
for
both
of
those
you
can't
be
convicted
unless
you
materially
and
willfully
make
a
false
statement.
so
you
think,
hey,
i
don't
need
a
special
section
on
that
one.
but
then
you
go
to
7201,
and
you
say,
oh,
my
god,
i
just
thought,
somebody
might
violate
this
by
going
off
to
some
special
country,
taking
all
his
assets
and
writing
ha-ha-ha.
now
there
is
no
fraud
or
deceit
in
that.
he
is
totally
open
about
it.
but
he
sure
has
evadded
it.
so
therefore
i
better
write
a
special
section.
now,
that's
the
simple-minded
argument,
but
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
be
evasion
simply
not
to
report
your
income?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
what
about
--
suppose
we
suppose
that
didn't
even
exist
here,
7201.
only
had
7206,
and
the
question
before
us
was
does
7206
fit
within
the
term
aggravated
felony,
i.e.,
does
it
involve
fraud
or
deceit?
so
we
read
7206;
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
fraud
or
deceit.
false
statement.
it
says
perjury
and
making
a
so
then
we
go
look
up,
what
are
the
and
he's
right.
fraud
torts
of
fraud
and
deceit?
traditionally
requires
an
intent
to
get
another
person
to
act,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
that
intent
to
violate
7206.
and
deceit,
it
not
only
involves
that,
it
so
the
also
involves
the
person
having
acted.
traditional
tort
of
deceit,
you
have
to
intend
the
act
and
he
actually
has
to
have
acted
to
his
detriment.
fraud,
you
have
the
first
of
those
and
second.
you
read
the
statute,
say,
well,
say
neither
of
those
is
present
here.
this
is
just
perjury,
which
isn't
good,
but
it's
and
there
we
are,
not
in
the
not
fraud
or
deceit.
statute.
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
not
always.
but
here
we
were
dealing
with
a
very
serious
statute,
aggravated
felonies,
that
has
terrible
consequences
for
the
persons
who
fall
within
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
most
of
these
m's
and
a's
and
b's
and
c's,
and
so
forth,
they
refer
to
statutes
by
number,
so
most
of
it
although
not
all
of
it
is
very
specific.
so
when
we
read
these
words
fraud
and
deceit
here,
why
don't
we
say
fraud
and
deceit
means
fraud
and
deceit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
traditional
elements.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
you
have
to
prove
that
the
--
the
liar
intended
reliance
to
--
to
his
detriment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
he
may
or
may
not
i
mean,
when
you
commit
--
a
person
commits
perjury
may
or
may
not
have
intended
that
a
victim
rely
to
his
detriment.
which
you
don't
have
to
prove
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
deceit
can
mean
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
the
tort
didn't
involve
the
tort
involved
the
same
element
of
fraud
which
you
don't
want
to
rely
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
evidence
of
what
--
i
mean
is
there
any
argument
other
than
that
you
just
think
that
and
you
could
argue
the
other
way?
i
mean
can
we
get
anywhere?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
go
up
and
start
with
i
mean,
if
this
justice
ginsburg's
first
question.
falls
within
it,
7206,
this
fraud,
what
about
perjury?
is
every
perjury
statute
within
it?
lying
to
a
fbi
agent?
and
what
about
and
what
about
lying
to
a
government
official
which
is
--
you
know,
there
are
all
kinds
of
statutes
on
that
one.
are
all
those
aggravated
felonies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
government's
view
is
that
of
course
you
have
to
meet
the
other
requirements.
but
as
far
as
the
words
fraud
or
deceit
is
concerned,
aggravated
felony
picks
up
every
perjury
statute,
every
lying
statute,
lying
to
an
fbi
agent,
lying
to
this
or
lying
to
that,
and
has
that
been
the
consistent
policy
of
the
immigration
service?
have
they
deported
people
where
the
other
two
conditions
were
fulfilled?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
all
i
need
are
a
few.
i
mean,
i
just
wonder,
is
it
the
policy
of
the
ins
and
the
government
to
deport
people
where
these
other
things
are
met,
which
they
may
perhaps
be
rarely,
i
don't
know.
but
to
deport
them
where
the
crime,
the
underlying
crime
cases.
is
perjury,
lying
to
an
fbi
agent
or
lying
to
other
government
officials.
