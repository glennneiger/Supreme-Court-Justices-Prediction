mr.
jeffrey
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
the
previous
case,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
need
to
formulate
federal
common
law
or
to
survey
customary
international
law.
here
congress
has
expressly
created
the
cause
of
action
at
issue
in
a
statute.
and
we
know
that
in
every
single
other
federal
court
statute
that
congress
has
ever
enacted,
it
has
provided
for
organizational
liability.
as
justice
kennedy
i
think
you
put
it
earlier,
it's
a
simple
concept
in
our
country.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
that
was
my
next
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
thank
you.
the
question
arises
in
this
case
why
did
congress
use
the
word
d.c.
circuit
that
gave
rise
to
the
tvpa.
and
in
that
case,
judge
edwards
wrote
a
lengthy
concurrence
where
he
again
and
again
used
the
word
individual
liability,
and
individual
to
describe
the
plo
which
was
the
very
defendant
in
that
case
against
the
backdrop
of
international
law
which
uses
the
term
individual
to
differentiate
anyone
from
the
state.
after
nuremberg,
starting
with
the
discussions
recited
most
prominently
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
6
to
8,
professor
jessup
and
many
others
discussed
whether
international
law
applies
simply
against
states
or
whether
it
applies
to
quote
individuals.
the
word
individual
was
used
again
and
again
to
mean
anyone
but
the
state.
and
as
professor
jessup
and
many
others
said
it,
includes
organizations
and
juridical
persons.
and
this
is
the
usage
that
judge
edwards
used
in
his
opinion
in
tel-oren.
he
uses
the
word
43
times
in
that
opinion.
and
if
you
look
at
nothing
else--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--no.
what
judge
edwards
concluded,
justice
ginsburg,
was
that
as
he
understood
the
alien
tort
statute
at
the
time
against
the
backdrop
of
international
law,
that
any
private
actor
acting
under
color
of
law
could
be
held
liable.
and
what
judge
edwards
decided
in
that
particular
case
was
that
the
plo
as
it
then
existed
was
not
a
state
actor.
but
the
rule
that
judge
edwards
proscribed
and
this
is
at
page
793
i
believe
in
his
concurrence
was
that
individuals
acting
under
color
of
law
should
be
held
liable.
that
is
the
precise
language
that
the
tvpa
uses.
so
if
you
want
to
know
where
congress
got
the
word
individual,
and
what
it
probably
thought
it
meant,
the
best
place
to
look
is
judge
edwards'
opinion.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
i
think,
justice
scalia,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--well,
i
think
judge
edwards'
opinion
was
quite
prominently
read
by
the
congress
then.
it
is
cited
throughout
the
legislative
history
in
the
senate
report,
in
the
house
report,
again
and
again
in
the
hearings.
and
this
court
i
think
in
skilling,
a
couple
terms
ago,
this
court
said
we
have
a
statute
before
us
dealing
with
honest
services.
and
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
used
particular
language.
well,
it
probably
meant
what
lower
court
judges
had
used
that
language
to
mean.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
well,
no,
justice
scalia--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--i
think
it's
a
strange
--
it's
a
very
strange
phrase
in
the
context
of
a
tort
statute,
because
we
know
that
congress
always
provides
for
organizational
liability,
and
it's
never
used
to
our
knowledge,
the
word
"individual"
in
a
tort
statute.
so
it
is
odd
that
it
appears
here.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
well,
i
think
it's
better
for
us
in
that
it
shows
that
congress
--
something
is
amiss.
and
i
think
judge
edwards'
opinion
explains
what
is
going
on.
now
what
my
opponents
want
this
court
to
do
is
to
look
at
other
places
in
the
u.s.
code
where
the
word
individual
is
used
outside
of
international
law,
outside
of
tort
regimes
and
we
concede
often
the
word
individual--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--no,
it
didn't.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
no,
justice
sotomayor,
for
two
reasons:
one
is
because
for
reasons
i
will
explain,
the
word
person
as
it
appears
in
the
tvpa
actually
only
applies
to
natural
persons.
let
me
start
with
that.
the
argument
the
other
side
has
is
the
word--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--i
think
the
argument
--
i
think
the
argument
is
that
the
word
person
somehow
contrasts
with
individual.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
and
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
only
natural
people
can
bring
wrongful
death
actions.
they
claim,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
argues
that
in
a
state,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
and
this
court
has
squarely
held,
only
natural
people
acting
as
administrator
or
executor
of
an
estate
can
bring
an
action.
so
the
word
person
refers
to
natural
person.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
we
don't
disagree
with
that's
how
the
word
gets
into
the
statute.
but
the
question,
as
this
court
has
always
looked
to
legislative
history
is,
what
does
that
--
what
light
does
that
shed
on
congress's
understanding
of
the
law
to
ultimately
pass.
so
two
congresses
later,
four
years
later
congress
passed
the
statute
with
the
word
individual.
and
the
problem
with
that--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--and
the
problem
with
that
theory,
justice
kagan,
is
it
squarely
is
contradicted
by
the
committee
reports
contemporaneous
with
the
statutes
that
say
we're
using
the
word
individual
to
make
crystal
clear
that
foreign
states
and
their
entities
cannot
be
sued.
and
that's
the
reason
that--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--yes,
pages
46
through
49
of
our
blue
brief,
justice
breyer.
there
are
numerous
references
to
organization,
the
word
organization,
group,
it
is
a
word
used.
and,
i
think
justice
kagan
this
is
also
responsive
to
your
question.
two
years
after
the
change
you
describe
was
made,
there
was
a
hearing
held
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
where
both
bills
were
being
considered.
the
one
bill
from
the
house
that
used
the
word
individual
and
the
word
--
and
the
senate
bill
which
used
the
word
person.
and
one
would
expect
that
if
people
thought
the
word
individual
meant
something
different
and
limited
the
class
of
defendants,
that
that
would
have
come
up
or
somebody
would
have
expressed
awareness
of
it.
but
to
the
contrary--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--natural
person,
justice
scalia.
and
we
have
cited
many
statutes
in
our
blue
brief
that
use
the
word
u.s.
code.
and
this
goes
to
the
question,
i
think
is
also
responsive
to
justice
sotomayor:
why
did
they
use
the
word
"individual",
instead
of
person?
why
did
they
say
in
the
committee
reports,
that
the
word
"individual"
made
it
crystal
clear
that
states
or
their
entities
could
not
be
sued.
and
the
reason
why
is
because
person
would
have
left
some
residual
ambiguity
as
to
whether
something
like
a
foreign
city
or
a
foreign
county,
think
of
a
foreign
county
jail
that
tortured
somebody.
under
section
1983
law,
which
uses
the
word
"person",
counties
and
cities
are
liable.
however,
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
under
established
international
law
sovereign
immunities
principle,
they
are
not.
so
the
word
individual--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--well,
i
respectfully
submit
they
didn't
think
about
that
question,
which
is
why
i
am
standing
here
today.
what
they
were
really
concerned
with
was
avoiding
sweeping
in
foreign
states
and
their
entities.
and
they
just
didn't
think.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
those
are
statements
to
that
affect.
and
of
course,
the
tvpa
does
cover
natural
persons
if
they
happen
to
be
in
the
united
states.
but
the
comment
that
justice
kagan
pointed
out
is
the
only
comment
that
the
other
side
can
find
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
well,
if
the
word
"individual"
could
only
mean
natural
person,
i
agree.
the
case
would
be
over.
but
we
have
cited
many
dictionary
definitions,
many
usages
in
the
u.s.
code,
and
many
holdings
from
this
court
and
others
that
have
actually
found
that
a
secondary
of
the
term
is
singularity.
a
single
unit
or
entity.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
right.
no
tort
statute
uses
it
one
way
or
the
other,
justice
ginsburg,
which
we
think,
if
anything,
gets
you
back
to
the
background
norms
and
the
secondary
meaning.
and
let
me
say
two
things
about--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--you
don't.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
and
i--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--i
don't
think
it's
that
they
have
different
meanings,
but
you
are
certainly
correct
that
they
refer
to
different
things.
but
that
is
no
different
than
numerous
other
statute
that
is
we
cite
at
page
28
and
29
of
our
brief
that
use
the
word
"person"
to
mean
a
plaintiff
when
it
can
just
be
a
natural
person
and
a
defendant
when
it
can
be
an
entity.
and,
indeed,
i
think,
if
i
don't
get
ahead
of
my--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--yes.
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
yes.
go
to
page
28
and
29
of
the
blue
brief.
and,
indeed,
their
whole
argument
--
and,
justice
kagan,
this
goes
back
to
your
point,
their
whole
argument
is:
when
the
word
"person"
was
used
throughout
the
statute,
then
it
--
then
it
changed
meanings
in
the
same
way,
that
it
covered
organizational
entities.
but
--
so
if
the
word
"person"
can
do
the
same
work,
the
word
"individual"
can
do
the
same
work.
so
the
question
is
why
--
i
think
the
question
that
you
end
up
with
is,
given
that
"individual"
has
this
secondary
meaning,
does
have
this
customary
usage
that
congress
may
well
have
been
aware
of,
that
at
least
that
this
court
often
says,
if
there
is
a
customary
usage
of
a
term,
we
will
assume
congress
was
aware
of
it.
why
would
congress
have
done
what
it
did
and
limit
this
act,
unlike
any
other
tort
statute
in
the
u.s.
code,
an
actual
person.
we
submit
there
is
no
good
reason.
justice
ginsburg,
you
talked
about
statements
legislative
history
to
the
effect
that
individual
people
who
are
torturers
may
be
found
in
the
united
states,
and
that's
true.
but
the
tvpa
is
a
tort
statute.
congress
already
had
on
the
books
immigration
laws
and
criminal
laws
that
refuse
safe
haven
to
such
people.
the
only
person
of
the
tvpa
is
to
provide
compensation.
and
in
every
court
regime
of
which
we
are
aware
in
federal
law
--
and
they
haven't
even
pointed
to
anything
to
the
contrary
in
state
law
or
in
international
law,
the
way
that
you
get
compensation
in
tort
regimes
is
you
hold
agents
liable
and
you
hold
corporations
liable
for
the
acts
of
their
agents.
it's
absolutely
understood.
and
there
is
no
good
reason
--
if
you
think
of
the
three
things
that
a
tort
statute
is
supposed
to
accomplish
--
compensation,
deterrence
and
accountability
--
on
all
three
of
those
stands,
the
tvpa
utterly
falls
flat
if
it
cannot
reach
organizations,
and
this
is
the
perfect
case
that
shows
you
how
that
is.
just
to
start
with
remedies--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--not--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--that
may
--
in
other
cases,
perhaps,
but
you
don't
find
anything
in
this
legislative
history
suggesting
that
organizations
were--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--well,
i
can't
prove
something
that
i
don't
have
a
piece
of
paper
for.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
justice
scalia,
one
would
expect
to
have
found
over
the
four
years
this
was
debated
and
the
hundreds
of
pages
of
legislative
history
some
clue
that
that
is
what
congress
was
reacting
to
and
thinking
about.
this
would
be
an
extraordinarily
unusual
statute,
and
you'd
think
that
one
person
in
the
congress
that
voted
for
it
or
in
the
committee
reports
that
are
contemporaneous
would
mention
that.
the
house
--
the
senate
report
has
a
section
called
"who
can
be
sued".
and
it
says
--
i
quoted
it
to
you
earlier
--
one
would
expect
to
find
in
that
section
that,
unlike
every
other
tort
statute,
we
are
restricting
the
people
that
can
be
sued,
but
they
said
instead--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
agree
that
if
the
word
"individual"
can
have
no
other
meaning
than
that
which
my
opponent
suggests,
then
i
lose.
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
and
we
have
cited
plenty
of
authorities
that
there
is
a
secondary
meaning
both
accepted
in
the
u.s.
code
and
in
cases
and
in
international
law
at
this
point.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
i
think,
chief
justice,
that
that
is
exactly
the
thought
process
that
congress
went
through.
and
i
can't
do
any
better
than
to
point--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--exactly.
that's
our
argument.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
and
page
6
to
8
of
our
reply
brief
explains
why
that
is
so.
i
know
--
i
know
it
might
be
surprising,
but
if
you
read--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--if
you
read--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--it
does.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
because
it's
more
precise
word
in
international
law
discourse
than
the
word
"person"
for
the
reason
i
described
before.
if
you
look
judge
edward's
opinion--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
well,
except
for
--
remember,
there
is
a
state
action
requirement
in
the
statute
that--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--i
mean,
maybe
there's
other
ways
that
congress
could
have
done
it,
but
the
way
judge
edwards
did
it
and
the
way
that
international
law
scholars
and
people
having
this
conversation
about
whether
people
other
than
states
ought
to
be
liable
under
international
law,
was
the
term
that
they
always
used,
and
it's
not
just
--
you
don't
just
--
you
know,
we
are
not
running
a
west
law
search
looking
for
wherever
we
can
find
it.
they
are
in
the
titles
of
the
articles,
is
whether
individuals
are
subject
to
liability.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
there
is
obviously
cases
to
that
effect,
but
i'm--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--i'm
aware
of
other
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--well,
i
think,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
of
the
jurisprudence
where
i
had
an
argument
in
this
court
about
the
second
or
successive
petitioner
rule
under
habeas
law.
and
this
court
has
said
second
--
even
though
where
"second"
has
an
obvious
ordinary
meaning,
it
doesn't
actually
mean
that.
it
has
a
specialized
usage
that
accumulated
in
the
law;
and
when
congress
used
that
term,
we
incorporate
that
usage.
and
so
there
is
case
after
case
where
this
court
has
said
--
the
morissette
principle
as
back
drop
against
common
law
where
this
court
has
said
that
you
do
look
to
usage
in
prior
opinions,
prior
case
law,
prior
discourse
as
a
way
of
infusing
statutes
with
meaning.
and
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
posed,
which
is,
why
would
congress
have
done
this
when
it
--
it
just
doesn't
have
an
answer
for
why
congress
would
do
this
in
this
particular
statute.
now
the
other
side
has
given
a
few
reasons
why
congress
might--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--well,
if
you
find
the
statute
at
least
somewhat
ambiguous
for
the
reasons
i've
described,
then
what
meyer
and
cases
say
is
you
assume
if
congress
didn't
think
about
it,
but
they
want
an
ordinary
tort
and
agency
principle,
and
the
--
the
--
in
title
vii
and
many
other
cases,
this
court
has
said,
of
course
congress
doesn't
think
about
all
these
things;
and
when
they
don't,
and
absent--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--the--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--the
question
father
drinan
was
responding
to
was
whether
or
not
the
tvpa
ought
to
be
extended
to
private
entities
that
do
not
act
under
color
of
law.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
and
at
the
time--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--yes,
if
you
look
at
that
quote,
remember,
that
hearing
was
held
before
the
oslo
accords,
before
the
plo
became
in
our
view
a
state
actor.
so
what
he's
saying,
if
you
look
at
the
quote
in
context,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
tvpa
shouldn't
be
drawn
to
sweep
in
groups
that
don't
act
under
color
of
law.
and
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
today.
we've
argued
that
the
plo
now
does
act
as
a
color
of
law,
and
that's
a
question
for
remand.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
well,
of
course,
i
was
just
responding
to
justice
breyer's
question
as
to
that
context.
but
--
but
if
you
go
even
beyond
compensation,
for
compensation
you
have
to
identify
somebody,
you
have
to
bring
them
into
a
court
and
you
have
to
enforce
a
judgment.
that
is
virtually
impossible
against
only
natural
people.
of
course
congress
would
have
expected
the
ordinary
rule
of
organizational
liability.
for
deterrence,
the
respondents'
argument
is
that
even
if
pirates,
inc.
--
and
for
this
case
we'll
make
it
torturers,
inc.
--
were
created
for
a
policy
of
torturing
people
abroad,
torturing
american
citizens
who
travel
abroad,
their
argument
is
you
could
not
hold
that
corporation
liable,
even
under
its
express
policy
and
purpose.
there
is
no
good
reason
under
deterrence
grounds
why
you
would
let
corporations
or
other
organizations
cycle
individual
actors
in
and
out
with
impunity.
and
finally
in
terms
of
accountability,
just
think
about
the
backdrop
again
with
which
this
statute
was
created.
there
are
some
pretty
horrible
groups
in
the
world
that
actually
claim
credit
and
responsibility
in
the
world
stage
for
torturing
or
killing
american
citizens;
and
the
idea
that
congress
would
have
passed
a
statute
that
these
organizations
can
stand
proud
in
their
view
and
say
we've
done
this,
and
that
our
statute
in
the
u.s.
code
would
--
would
somehow
only
get
their
agent,
and
not
the
organization
or
entity
itself,
we
submit
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
disagree
that
it's
unusual
statute.
it's
not
unheard
of;
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs
many
other
statutes
that
apply
extraterritorially,
but
remember
that
all
the
arguments
for
and
against
foreign
policy
friction
that
you
heard
in
the
first
case
don't
apply
here.
congress
expressly--
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
--with
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
would
just
say
if
you
look
back
at
the
legislative
history,
the
only
conversation
that
was
had
is
should
we
reach
non-state
actors.
that
was
the
only
conversation
that
was
had,
and
that's
the
conversation
you
referred
to
earlier.
nobody
suggested
that
if
you
apply
this
extraterritorially,
if
you
enacted
this
statute,
that
you
somehow
ought
to
shirk
from
the
ordinary
rules
of
--
of
organizational
liability.
nobody
suggested
that.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
i
don't
think
--
if
i
could
beg
your
indulgence
for
one
moment
--
i
don't
think
i
need
to
argue
that,
because
i
think
that
for
all
the
reasons
i
have
given
there
is
enough
ambiguity
and
there
is
good
enough
reasons
why
we
would
assume
congress
meant
the
ordinary
rule.
but
if
i
had
to
make
that
argument,
i
think
i
could,
because
the
only
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
in
the
papers
are
reasons
for
not
having
this
extraterritorial
statute
in
the
first
place.
there
is
no
good
reason
once
you
have
it
not
to
apply
to
organizational
actors.
and
justice
breyer,
this
goes
back
to
your
comment.
it's
still
a
mystery
to
me
how
it's
more
problematic
in
international
relations
to
hold
an
organization
accountable
--
to
not
--
to
hold
organization
accountable
than
to
hold
its
--
its
board
of
directors
on
a
personal
basis,
or
to
hold
indeed
a
high
official
of
a
foreign
government.
nobody's
made
that
argument,
and
if
i
could
say
one
thing
and
i
will
reserve
my
time.
take
a
good
look
at
the
united
states'
two
briefs.
their
--
the
only
argument
they
provide
in
of
the
kiobel
case
is
that
there
is
no
good
reason
--
that's
--
that's
the
united
states'
terms
--
why
congress
would
want
to
have
a
statute
that
applies
only
to
judgment
proof
individual
actors
and
not
to
agents
on
whom
they're
acting
on
behalf
of.
and
we
think
that
that
is
exactly
right,
and
that's
why
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
that
here.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder.
mr.
jeffrey
fisher
i
can
make
four
points,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
first,
when
asked
again
and
again
why
congress
would
have
done
this,
i
think
all
i
heard
was
that
congress
wanted
to
adopt
an
incremental
approach.
and
then
mr.
gannon
said,
well,
maybe
we
also
wanted
to
have
moral
accountability.
well,
an
incremental
approach
doesn't
make
any
sense.
yes,
congress
did
so
in
the
context
of
requiring
exhausting
a
limitations
period,
so
it
treaded
softly
there.
but
there
are
numerous
federal
statutes:
rico,
the
sherman
act,
the
antiterrorism
act,
which
is
quite
similar
to
this
act
in
many
ways,
that
apply
to
events
abroad.
and
they
all
apply
to
organizations.
so
if
congress
was
going
to
do
this,
there's
no
reason
to
think
it
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
do
it.
miss
ferguson
pointed
to
the
dorelien
case
as
the
one
example
she
could
point
of
where
a
tvpa
judgment
was
able
to
be
enforced.
and
the
only
reason
why
that
was
able
to
be
enforced
is
because
that
guy
happened
to
win
the
florida
lottery.
he
had
hidden
all
of
his
other
assets
abroad
and
won
the
florida
lottery.
is
that
the
statute
that
congress
meant
to
pass?
we
don't
think
so.
moral
accountability
was
already
taken
care
of
in
the
u.s.
criminal
code.
there's
an
express
provision
of
the
u.s.
criminal
code
that
holds
torturers
liable
for
torturing
abroad.
and
we've
cited
that
in
our
briefs.
i
know
some
of
you
are
going
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
so
let
me
say
two
quick
things
about
the
legislative
history.
first,
justice
kagan,
with
respect
to
representative
leech's
comment,
if
anyone
after
that
hearing
wanted
to
know
what
that
committee
thought
the
change
it
had
made
meant,
and
what
the
bill
meant,
it
would
have
looked
at
its
report.
and
if
we've
cited
--
we've
cited
the
committee
reports
in
the
foreign
relations
committee,
and
it
says
the
tvpa
allows
liability
for
any
person
that
commits
torture.
it
uses
the
word
"person"
utterly
interchangeably
with
the
word
"individual".
so
that's
--
whatever
moment
happened
4
years
before
the
enactment
was
long
since
lost.
and
the
reason
it
used
ultimately
the
word
"individual"
and
not
"person",
as
i've
described
before,
was
to
steer
clear
i
think
of
any
possibility
of
state
entities.
mr.
gannon
points
to
monell,
but
monell
favors
us.
monell
holds
that
organizations
can
be
liable.
now,
there's
a
separate
question
that
you
talked
about
in
the
earlier
argument,
too,
as
to
what
the
mens
rea
would
be,
whether
it
would
have
to
be
according
to
a
policy
or
practice,
or
whether
it
would
be
pure
respondeat
superior.
but
monell
is
on
our
side
in
this
case,
and
we've
alleged
a
policy
in
our
complaint
in
this
case.
thirdly,
in
the
u.s.
code,
where
the
word
"individual"
is
used,
it
obviously
means
natural
persons
lots
of
times.
but
when
it
does,
it
almost
always
uses
the
--
contrasts
it
in
that
very
sentence
with
an
entity
or
organization.
so
in
this
course,
when
you
say
individuals
or
corporations,
yes,
you
mean
a
natural
person.
but
as
the
united
states
points
out
in
footnote
3
of
its
own
brief,
the
word
"individual"
when
it
is
used
alone
is
a
less
favored
usage
that
actually
gives
rise
to
ambiguity
because
of
the
secondary
meaning
i've
described
before.
and
then
finally,
let
me
say
the
questions
are
asked
about
the
relationship
between
this
case
and
the
kiobel
case,
and
i
think
it's
absolutely
clear
--
and
this
goes
again
to
one
of
justice
kagan's
questions
on
absurdity
--
if
this
court
holds
that
the
alien
tort
statute
would
have
let
a
torturer
right
by
mr.
rahim,
someone
who's
tortured,
that
is,
bring
a
cause
of
action,
i
think
it
would
indeed
be
absurd
to
imagine
congress
stepping
in
and
passing
a
statute
saying
if
you're
an
american
citizen,
i'm
sorry,
you're
out
of
luck.
but
if
you
happen
to
be
lucky
enough
to
be
an
alien
and
never
having
tried
to
be
a
citizen
in
this
country,
go
ahead
and
bring
the
case
in
our
courts;
we
think
that
would
be
absurd.
so
with
those
points,
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions
around
the
submissions
i've
made
--
i
guess
the
last
thing
i
would
say
is,
at
the
end
of
mr.
gannon's
argument,
he
referred
to
the
interplay
between
the
word
"individual"
and
"person"
in
the
briefs,
and
i
can
assure
you
from
have
having
worked
on
this
during
the
case,
it
is
an
incredible
sideshow
as
to
whether
or
not
estates
are
people
and
all
the
ways
that
that
works.
but
it's
laid
out
in
our
brief,
and
we
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
disjoint
between
the
word
"individual"
and
"person".
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
it
will
explain
why.
