mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
torture
victim
protection
act
to
create
a
cause
of
action
against
individuals
who
commit
acts
of
torture
or
extrajudicial
killing
under
color
of
law
against
other
individuals.
petitioners
attempt
to
inject
ambiguity
into
what
is
it
a
very
unambiguous
term
in
u.s.
legal
usage
by
referring
in
their
reply
brief
to
a
supposed
subtle
definition
of
"individual"
in
international
law.
but
individual
is
not
a
term
of
art
that
has
a
specialized
meaning
in
international
law
different
from
its
ordinary
meaning
in
--
in
u.s.
legal
usage.
petitioners'
reply
brief
cites
two
secondary
sources
spanning
a
60-year
period,
while
other
international
law
sources
including
the
restatement,
international
conventions
and
other
scholars,
emphasize
the
distinction
between
individuals
and
private
organizations.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
congress
was
proceeding
very
cautiously
and
incrementally
in
enacting
a
statute
with
extraordinary
territorial
reach
over
executive
branch
opposition.
it
decided
to
focus
on
the
personally
responsible
wrongdoers
who
subject
victims
to
torture
or
extrajudicial
killing,
and
did
not
go
beyond
that
to
reach
another
class
of
organizations
that
could
be
held
secondarily
liable.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
congress
was
focused
very
much
on
the
filartiga
case,
where
the
second
circuit
had
found
that
there
was
a
norm
prohibiting
public
officials
from
engaging
in
torture
or
extrajudicial
killing;
and
congress
wanted
to
avoid
the
scenario
where
you
have
a
torturer
who
comes
to
our
shores;
and
congress
agreed
with
the
second
circuit
in
filartiga
that
if
the
torturer
comes
here,
he
should
not
be
able
to
escape
accountability
from
his
victim.
if
his
victim
finds
him
in
our
--
in
our
country,
there
should
be
a
cause
of
action.
but
congress
had
every
reason
to
proceed
very
cautiously
and
incrementally.
it
put
its
toe
in
the
--
in
the
extraterritorial
waters
when
it
extended
universal
civil
jurisdiction
to
violations
of
certain
international
law
norms.
it
did
not
dive
in.
as
we
heard
this
morning
in
the
kiobel
argument,
this
is
a
very
complex
area
as
to
what
norms
are
actionable
under
international
law.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
there
have--
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
--petitioners
have
identified--
one
case,
the
jean
v.
--
case,
excuse
me,
where
there
was
a
collection.
there
may
be
other
cases
where
there
ultimately
is
a
satisfaction
of
the
judgment.
but
it's
inherent
in
the
statute
that
reaches
foreign
defendants
that
often
they
do
not
have
access
in
the
united
states.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
the
--
the
situation
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
tvpa
was
adjusting
the
norm
against
state-sponsored
torture
and
extrajudicial
killing,
where
the
agent
is
--
is
almost
invariably
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state,
and
yet
it
didn't
create
an
exception
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
to
state
sponsors
of
torture
and
extrajudicial
killing.
it
was
concerned
with
this
filartiga
scenario,
where
the
u.s.
wanted
to
take
a
position
--
we
will
not
give
torturers
a
safe
haven
in
our
country.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
the
immigration
laws
were
not
as
robust
in
1991
as
they
perhaps
are
now.
we
--
we
know
that
the
tvpa
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
the
torturer
is
in
fact
found
in
the
united
states,
because
otherwise,
the
united
states
couldn't
assert
personal
jurisdiction
over--
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
--it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
perfect
screen,
because
of
course,
torturers
don't
announce
themselves
at
the
border
as
torturers.
so
in
fact,
that's
why
we
have
situations
where
we've
had
these
gross
human
rights
violators
that
end
up
in
the
united
states.
even
--
in
one
of
the
cases
we
heard,
won
the
florida
lottery.
so
--
so
they
do
find
their
way
to
our
country.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
the
organization
that
congress
had
foremost
in
mind
was
the
state.
this
is
state-sponsored
torture,
state-sponsored
extrajudicial
killing.
the
--
the
problem
it
describes
regarding
torturers
and
extrajudicial
killing
is
one
of
states.
the
legislative
history
talks
about
how
one-third
of
the
states
are
--
have
been
engaged
in
sponsoring
torture
and
extrajudicial
killing.
but
those
were
the
organizations
they
had
foremost
in
their
mind,
and
yet
the
statute
doesn't
impose
liability
on
those
organizations.
it
suggested
a
very
personal
wrong
of
a
torturer
avoiding
accountability
to
their
victims
in
their
home
country,
and
coming
to
our
country
and
seeking
safe
haven--
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
--i
think
--
i
think
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
plausible
reason
why
congress
would
have
taken
this
incremental
approach,
and
focused
first
on
those
personally
responsible
versus
extending
liability
more
broadly
under
secondary
liability
theories.
and
because
the
statute
is
so
clear
on
its
face,
because
"individual"
carries
its
ordinary
meaning,
and
the
surrounding
statutory
text
confirm
that
congress
was
using
"individual"
in
its
ordinary
sense,
couldn't
prevent
the
very
high
bar
for
the
court
to
depart
from
the
plain-text
meaning
of
the
statute.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
it
could
be
clearer--
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
--yes.
it's
possible,
but
it
was
clear
enough--
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
--i
think
that
even
the
human
rights
supporters
who
were
strong
advocates
of
getting
this
legislation
enacted
understood
that
this
was
an
incremental
approach,
that
where
there
was
some
certainty
within
international
law
within
this
area
of
official
torture
carried
out
by
public
officials
under
color
of
state
law,
and
it
provided
a
cause
of
action
for
this
filartiga
scenario,
and
even
the
human
rights
supporters
understood
that
it
was
important
to
proceed
cautiously
and
incrementally.
this
--
the
united
states
does
not
tread
lightly
when
imposing
its
jurisdiction
over
the
acts
of
foreign
defendants
for
foreign
conduct
under
color
of
foreign
law.
that's
an
intrusion
on
other
nations'
jurisdiction.
and
we
don't
do
that
lightly.
ms.
laura
g.
ferguson
well,
representative
yaton
was
the
sponsor
of
both
the
bill
that
was
marked
up
where
"person"
was
changed
to
"individual",
and
was
also
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
that
was
ultimately
enacted.
so
he
was
certainly
aware
that
"individual"
was
selected
for
this
reason
of
excluding
corporations.
but
more
importantly,
"individual"
almost
invariably
carries
the
meaning
of
"natural
person".
if
congress
had
wanted
the
statute
to
reach
nonsovereign
organizations,
it
very
easily
could
have
used
the
term
1983
does.
and
the
notion
that
they
couldn't
use
"person"
because
it
would
encompass
foreign
states
is
not
the
case
when
you're
dealing
with
a
person
to
describe
a
potential
class
of
defendants,
because
we
presume
that
congress
does
not
intend
to
aggregate
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
and
the
dictionary
act
tells
us
that
"person"
is
the
term
congress
uses
when
it
wants
to
refer
to
natural
persons
and
artificial
persons,
but
not
sovereigns.
so
if
the
congress
wanted
to
do
what
the
petitioners
claim,
they
had
a
very
useful
term
that
congress
uses
all
the
time
to
reach
that
category,
and
it's
the
term
"person".
but
instead,
they
used
"individual",
and
elsewhere
in
the
same
sentence,
they
used
"individual"
to
refer
to
who
shall
be
liable.
they
used
"individual"
four
more
times
in
a
way
that
can
only
mean
a
human
being.
now
granted,
there
are
exceptions
to
this
canon
of
consistent
usage,
but
they
have
no
fair
application
here.
those
canons
apply
when
you
have
a
term
that
has
more
than
one
ordinary
meaning
and
you
can
use
them
interchangeably
without
being
confusing.
here,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
individual
is
to
exclude
organizations.
we
regularly
use
individual
to
mean
we're
not
talking
about
corporations;
we're
not
talking
about
organizations.
so
in
the
same
sentence
of
the
statute
to
use
individual
to
mean
--
let's
assume
we
don't
normally
mean
corporations
and
then
immediately
just
switch
and
--
and
use
it
to
refer
to
human
beings
would
be
very
confusing.
and
yet
we
see
congress
very
deliberately
and
carefully
then
switch
to
the
broader
term
"person"
when
it
wanted
to
sweep
in
a
broader
class
of
potential
plaintiffs.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
they
were
sweeping
as
broadly
as
possible
to
allow
persons
who
have
wrongful
death
claims
to
be
able
to
bring
a
suit
where
the
victim
has
died.
so
they
use
the
term
"person".
and
petitioners'
interpretation
gives
no
separate
meaning
to
individual
and
person,
but
we
assume
that
when
congress
uses
those
terms
distinctly,
they
intend
to
give
them
different
meanings.
i
would
just
return
to
the
plain
text
of
the
statute.
it's
very
clear.
the
only
situation
in
which
the
court
has
found
that
"individual"
should
be
interpreted
inconsistent
with
its
ordinary
meaning
is
upon
a
showing
of
absurd
results.
here,
there
simply
is
no
absurd
result.
congress
had
every
reason
to
proceed
cautiously
and
incrementally
in
extending
u.s.
jurisdiction
over
conduct
that
has
no
nexus
to
the
united
states.
and
it
proceeded
by
focusing
on
this
filartiga
scenario,
ensuring
that
the
united
states
would
not
become
a
safe
haven
for
torturers.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
give
the
statute
its
plain-text
meaning
and
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
