justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
congress
got
it
from
judge
edwards.
gee,
my
goodness.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
will
bet
you
none
of
them
--
none
of
them
even
read
that
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
strange
phrase,
honest
services,
as,
you
know,
as
a
crime,
deprivation
--
deprivation
of
honest
services.
but
the
word
"individual"
is
not
a
strange
word
at
all.
it's
used
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
an
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
better
for
you
or
worse
for
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
am
a
member
of
the
house
or
of
the
senate.
and
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
committee
that
engages
in
all
of
this
legislative
history.
and
i
--
i
see
the
word
individual
in
this
statute.
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
i
vote
for
or
against
the
statute.
why
should
i
be
saddled
with
whatever
sayings
by
members
of
the
committee
or
by
experts
testifying
before
the
committee
occurred?
it
was
out
of
my
hearing.
i
voted
for
individual.
and
individual
--
well
--
if
congress
wanted
individual
to
mean
what
you
say
it
doesn't
mean,
what
word
would
they
have
used
instead?
i
mean,
if
individual
is
a
code
word
for
person,
what's
the
code
person
for
individual?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
organizations
opposed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
organizations
opposed
the
extension
of
the
legislation
to
themselves.
is
that
conceivable?
and
is
congress
ever
influenced
by
such
lobbying?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
don't
find
lobbying
in
the
legislative
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
explanation.
you
say
there
is
no
possible
explanation.
i
can
imagine
that
corporations
would
have
been
quite
upset
by
this
notion.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
the
dog
that
did
not
bark,
right?
legislation
cannot
mean
what
it
says
unless
the
legislative
history
says
that
it
means
what
it
says.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fisher,
it
seems
to
me
you
misrepresent
our
jurisprudence
when
you
insist
that
"individual"
has
to
have
only
that
meaning.
that's
not
what
our
jurisprudence
says.
we
say
that
we
give
words
their
usual
meaning,
their
common
meaning.
even
though
they
may
sometimes
be
used
in
a
different
fashion,
it's
the
usual
or
common
meaning
that
we
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
many
cases
to
that
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
say
it
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
find
it
hard
enough
to
parse
the
statute
without
having
to
parse
father
drinan's
testimony.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
immigration
officials
conduct
a
thorough
investigation.
i
mean,
is
there
a
box
on
the
immigration
form,
you
know,
"have
you
tortured
people?
"
"yes,
no.
"
i
really
don't
think
they
investigate
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
prove
it's
an
intelligent
statute,
could
you?
maybe
it's
a
stupid
statute.
is
that
possible?
is
it
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
possible
that
it
--
it's
a
stupid
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
were
thinking
about
that
in
1797,
i
mean
--
you
are
saying
in
the
later
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
more
perceptive
congress
in
--
in
1797?
