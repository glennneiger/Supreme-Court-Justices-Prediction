i
thought
you
said
that
judge
edwards
opinion
was
about
politically
motivated
terrorists,
not
coming
within
the
alien
tort
statute.
justice
ruth
bader

there
were
witnesses
who
testified,
were
there
not,
mr.
fisher,
that
the
tvpa
would
take
care
of
a
type
case
that
when
the
torturer
shows
up
physically
--
those
were
the
words
that
used
--
the
torturer
comes
into
the
state,
into
the
united
states,
is
physically
present
in
the
united
states.
that
was
the
model
that
at
least
those
witnesses
had
in
mind,
that
some
of
them
were
quite
distinguished
witnesses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
found
no
tort
statute,
you
use
the
"individual"
to
include
organizations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
judgments
under
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
filartiga
or
fabrigas
--
that
that
pattern,
where
the
individual
torturer
is
found
in
a
u.s.
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
have
been
many
judgments;
how
many
have
collected?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
congress
really
wanted
to
have
this,
why
wouldn't
it
include
entity
liability?
the
corporation
is
likely
to
have
more
money
than
an
individual
torturer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
that
be
the
point
that
the
immigration
law
takes
care
of
it?
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
into
the
country.
