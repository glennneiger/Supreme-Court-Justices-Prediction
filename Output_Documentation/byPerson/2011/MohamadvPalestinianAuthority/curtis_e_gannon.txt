mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
using
the
term
"individual"
when
describing
who
shall
be
liable
for
damages
under
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
congress
chose
to
limit
the
statute's
scope
to
natural
persons.
that's
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
"individual",
especially
in
legal
usage.
and
as
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out,
this
statute
uses
the
term
"person"
in
addition
to
the
term
"individual".
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
alien
may
be
able
to
sue.
and
i
think
that's
going
to
depend
ultimately
on
this
court's
construction
of
the
ats.
there
are
always
going
to
be
differences
in
application
between
the
ats
and
the
tvpa
so
long
as
the
ats
is
still
on
the
books
and
has
any
vitality.
that
of
course
wasn't
clear
to
congress
when
it
enacted
the
tvpa
in
1992.
it
wasn't
sure
whether
the
ats
was
going
to
be
a
going
concern
in
light
of
judge
bork's
opinion
in
tel-oren.
but
rather
than
amend
the
ats,
congress
in
the
tvpa
decided
to
create
a
separate
statute
which
provided
an
express
right
of
action
both
to
aliens
and
to
u.s.
citizens
for
two
specific
norms.
it's
broader
than
the
ats
in
several
ways
but
it's
narrower
that
the
ats
in
several
ways.
so
if
your
hypothetical
involved
piracy,
two
victims
of
piracy,
then
it's
quite
clear
after
this
court's
decision
in
sosa--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
is
ultimately
going
to
depend
on
what
happens
under
this
court's
ats
jurisprudence,
and
so
it
does
seem
that
the
court--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
position
of
the
united
states
in
the
other
case
today
is
that
the
ats
does
not
include
a
categorical
bar
on
corporate
liability;
and
that
--
that
has
no
regard
for
the
theory
of
liability,
the
locus
of
the
acts,
the
citizenship
of
the
parties
and
the
character
of
the
international
law
norm
at
issue.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
in
--
in
this
instance,
then
that
would
present
a
different
question
that
this
court
has
not
yet
been
presented
with
under
the
ats,
and
ultimately,
maybe
an
alien
will
be
able
to
bring
a
suit
under
the
ats
that
he
can't
bring
--
that
a
u.s.
citizen
could
not
bring
under
the
tvpa,
but
that
is
a
product
of
the
fact
that
there
are
still
two
different
statutes.
the
alien
tort
statute
will
always
give
more
rights
to
aliens
than
to
u.s.
citizens
because
by
definition
it
is
only
available
to
aliens.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
there
are
several
reasons
that
congress
could
have
had
in
mind,
although
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
legislative
record,
that
justice
kagan
is
probably
correct,
that
most
members
of
the
congress
weren't
thinking
precisely
about
this
question.
representative
leach
appears
to
have
been.
i
think
that
in
the
other
passage
cited
on
page
25
of
the
united
states
brief
involving
father
drinan
that
justice
breyer
was
looking
at
before,
there
is
an
earlier
passage
that
we
cite
where
father
drinan
seems
to
indicate
there
may
be
a
distinction
between
the
two
bills
that
are
pending
before
the
senate
at
that
point,
because
one
refers
to
persons
and
one
refers
to
individuals.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
no,
i
think
that
in--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--no,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
ats
has
not
even
attempted
to
speak
to
this
question,
whereas
the
tvpa
does.
as
this
court
noted
in
amerada
hess,
the
ats
does
not
define
a
class
of
defendants
here.
congress
define
a
class
of
defendants,
and
i
think
that
there
are
several
reasons
why
they
ended
up
with
this
result,
the
chief
of
which
is
that
all
of
the
cases
that
they
were
thinking
about
at
that
time
had
involved
natural
persons.
the
--
the
filartiga
case
was
--
was
the
flagship
case--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
true.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
but
the
fact--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--no,
but
the
reason
they
are
not
thinking
about
it
is
because
the
paradigm
they
were
thinking
about
was
the
torturer
who
is
found
in
the
united
states
who
is
--
who
is
walking
on
the
streets.
there
is
an
individual
moral
accountability
that
--
that
everybody
understood
needed
to
happen
there.
to
the
extent
that
the
legislative
history
is
referring
to
groups,
my
friend
mr.
fisher
referred
to
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
groups
and
organizations
that
basically
are
references
to
things
like
death
squads.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
even
today
none
of
the
cases
in
the
eleventh
circuit
that
are
brought
under
the
tvpa
are
being
brought
against
death
squads.
they
--
the
case
that
petitioners
cite
in
their
reply
brief,
the
drummond
case,
was
not
a
case
where
the
columbia
paramilitary
was
a
defendant.
the
defendants
there
were
actually
two
corporations
and
a
ceo.
and
so
i
think
as
a
--
as
a
practical
matter,
although
it
is
natural
for
us
to
think
that
if
an
individual
is
liable,
then
so
too
is
the
organization
that
it
may
have
been
acting
--
that
he
may
have
been
acting
on
behalf
of;
but
it
is
not
natural
to
think
that
these
type
of
clandestine
shadowy
organizations
that
would
claim
responsibility
for
such
acts
--
such
heinous
acts
overseas,
would
have
a
jurisdictional
presence
in
the
united
states.
and
i
think
if
you
--
as
respondents'
counsel
already
noted,
because
the
tvpa
requires
state
action,
the
organizational
entity
here
is
usually
going
to
be
the
states,
but
petitioners
acknowledge
that
no
state
entity
is
going
to
be
liable
here,
and
indeed
the
result
here
is
not
that
dissimilar
to
some
of
this
court's
1983
jurisprudence.
petitioners
mentioned
the
question
of
whether
congress
was
concerned
that
the
term
"person"
might
pull
in
something
like
municipalities,
because
it
could
be
read
to
bring
in
sovereigns,
but
in
--
in
the
context
of
municipalities,
under
monell
this
court
has
concluded
there
is
no
respondeat
superior
liability,
and
that
superiors
or
supervisors
are
not
liable
for
the
torts
of
their
agents;
they
are
only
liable
for
their
own
individual
wrongs.
and
so
i
do
think
that
there
are
policy
reasons
why
congress
could
have
said
something
different
here.
but
--
and
they
may
well
be
encouraged
to
do
that
by
20
years
of
ats
precedent,
that
as
now
for
the
first
time
since
the
tvpa
was
enacted
started
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
corporations
should
be
held
liable
under
the
other
statute.
if
congress
wants
to
disagree
with
the
types
of
policy
concerns
that
were
behind
this
court's
monell
decision,
congress
could
reach
a
different
result,
but
we
don't
--
don't
think
that
that's
a
decision
that
ought
to
be
reached
through
statutory
construction.
here,
congress
used
the
term
"individual".
it
spoke
about
an
individual
who
subjects
an
individual
to
torture
or
extrajudicial
killing.
it
separately
referred
to
"person".
and
petitioners'
reading
of
the
statute
actually
gets
the
relationship
between
person
and
individual,
which
is
quite
clear
as
an
ordinary
question
of
federal
statutory
construction
in
the
dictionary
act,
precisely
backwards,
because
under
their
reading,
"individual"
means
any
nonsovereign
natural
or
artificial
person,
but
"person"
can
only
mean
natural
person.
and
so
we
think
that
that
is
--
is
a
particularly
odd
reading
of
the
statute
in
light
of
the
dictionary
act,
and
the
statutory
structure.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
