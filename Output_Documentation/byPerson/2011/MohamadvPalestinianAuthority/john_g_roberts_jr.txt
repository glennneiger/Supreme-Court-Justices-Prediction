chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-88
mohamad
v.
the
palestinian
authority.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
usually
like
--
we
usually
like
to
begin
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
did
this
to
--
they
chose
that
word
to
avoid
any
residual
ambiguity.
but
they
thought
there
was
no
ambiguity
at
all
as
to
whether
the
term
"individual"
meant
natural
persons
or
organizational
entities?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
the
additional
problem,
though,
that
your
reading
gives
a
different
meaning
to
"individual"
in
two
sentences
that
are
right
--
actually
it's
in
the
same
sentence:
an
"individual"
who
does
the
torturing,
subjects
an
"individual"
to
torture.
now,
i
under
your
argument
that
you
can
have
an
organization
doing
the
subject
thing,
but
how
do
you
subject
an
organization
to
torture?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
"individual"
in
the
one
clause,
you
say
means
"organization";
"individual"
in
the
other
necessarily
does
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
congress,
as
you
have
indicated,
congress
focused
on
the
very
question
of
whether
organizations
would
be
covered
or
not
in
the
context
of
whether
a
state
would
be
covered.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legislative
history
cuts
strongly
against
you,
putting
even
aside
congressman
leach.
the
issue
was
there.
and
if
they
meant
to
say,
well,
let's
find
a
term
that
leaves
some
types
of
organizations
out,
states,
but
not
others,
we
will
just
say
"individual",
and
people
will
understand
that
we
don't
mean
a
state,
but
they
will
also
know
that
we
do
mean
another
type
of
organization
or
corporation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
at
least
ambiguous.
when
you
are
saying,
well,
we
want
a
term
that
is
going
to
include
individual
persons
and
organizations
but
not
state
organizations.
and
the
only
term
that
fits
perfectly
is
"individual".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
really?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
hah,
hah.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
have
been
saying
all
along
"individual"
has
a
secondary
meaning.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
would
they
have
picked
the
secondary
meaning
of
a
word
rather
than
try--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
tvpa
is
an
extraordinary
step
in
terms
of
exposing
liability,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
an
odd
idea
that
congress
would
want
to
proceed
carefully
before
establishing
a
situation
where
the
--
the
use
of
the
american
tribunal
is
as
broad
as
it
is
under
this
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
ferguson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
--
mr.
fisher
ended
by
saying
there's
no
reason
congress
would
draw
this
line.
why
would
they
want
to
hold
the
individual
controlling
officers
of
an
organization
liable
for
torture,
but
not
the
organization
itself?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gannon.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-88,
mohamad
versus
the
palestinian
authority.
