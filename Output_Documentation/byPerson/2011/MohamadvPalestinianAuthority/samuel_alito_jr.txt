justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
your
explanation
of
the
reason
why
congress
would
draw
a
distinction
between
an
individual
and
an
organization.
you
keep
saying
that
the
--
in
the
case
of
the
individual,
the
individual
was
here.
but
the
organization
can
be
here,
too.

samuel
a.

mr.
gannon,
suppose
two
people
are
tortured,
and
one
is
an
alien
who
has
never
been
within
10,000
miles
of
the
united
states,
and
the
other
is
a
u.s.
citizen.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
alien
can
sue,
but
the
u.s.
citizen
can't?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
two
victims
of
torture,
you
don't
find
that
to
be
an
incongruous
result?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
asking
about
your
position,
the
position
of
the
united
states.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
mr.
rahim
had
never
been
naturalized.
i
guess
that
was
a
mistake.
