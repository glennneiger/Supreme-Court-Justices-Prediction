the
problem
is
i
don't
even
look
there.
i
look
to
the
tvpa,
section
2
(a)(2)
which
uses
the
word
person.
so,
it
wasn't
as
if
in
writing
the
statute
congress
forgot
the
word
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
they
appear
to
be
using
"person"
in
the
organizational
way
that
person
is
defined
in
the
dictionary
act
and
elsewhere.
so
isn't
that
a
textual
clue
that
they
were
using
the
word
"individual"
in
a
different
sense.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
individuals
legal
representative
or
to
any
person
who
may
be
a
claimant
in
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
legal
representative
is
often,
can
be
a
person
but
can
often
also
be
a
corporation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
same
sentence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
those
statutes
you
sp--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
okay
to
keep
out
individuals
who
subject
others
to
torture,
but
corporations,
we
want
their
money
so
they
should
invest
here,
because
we're
going
to
protect
them
from
liability
for
people
that
they
torture?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
good
reason--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--for
the
u.s.
to
have
limited
liability
to
natural
persons
in
the
tvpa,
but
not
in
the
ats
context?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
torture
victims
protection
act
or
tvpa
authorizes
a
cause
of
action
against
“an
individual”
for
acts
of
torture
and
extrajudicial
killing.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
term
individual
as
used
here
means
natural
persons
or
whether
the
term
is
used
more
broadly
such
that
the
act
authorizes
liability
against
certain
organizations.
in
1995,
azzam
rahim,
a
naturalized
u.s.
citizen,
traveled
to
the
west
bank.
there,
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
he
was
arrested
by
palestinian
authority
intelligence
officers
imprisoned,
tortured,
and
ultimately
killed.
ten
years
later,
his
relatives,
petitioners
here,
brought
suit
against
the
palestinian
authority
and
the
palestinian
liberation
organization
asserting
claims
of
torture
and
extrajudicial
killing
under
the
tvpa.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
only
natural
persons
could
be
sued
under
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
affirmed
and
we
now
affirm
as
well.
petitioners
concede
that
foreign
states
may
not
be
sued
under
the
act,
namely,
that
the
act
did
not
create
an
exception
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
of
1976.
they
argue
however,
that
the
act
does
not
similarly
restrict
liability
against
other
entities.
in
petitioner's
view,
by
permitting
suit
against
an
individual,
the
tvpa
contemplates
liability
against
natural
persons
and
non-sovereign
organizations.
we
decline
to
read
individual
so
unnaturally.
as
explained
in
more
detail
in
our
opinion,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
“individual”
and
the
statutory
context
in
which
it
is
used
persuades
us
that
the
act
authorizes
suits
against
natural
persons
alone.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous
as
--
except
as
to
justice
scalia
who
joins
the
court's
opinion
except
as
to
part
3(b).
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
