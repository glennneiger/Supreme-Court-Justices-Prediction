justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
i
looked
at
--
i
have
looked
at
--
i
know
i
have
to
go
through
legislative
history.
i've
said
it
is
meaningful
and
so
i
do
it.
and
so
far
--
so
far,
i
think
i
have
to
say
that
you
are
on
a
weak
wicket.
the
word
persons
when
it
was
there,
i
found
lots
and
lots
of
instances
and
by
people
in
the
civil
international
civil
rights
community
who
are
testifying.
or
i
look
at
what
they
say
and
over
and
over
they
say,
a
limited
statute
--
the
person
won't
often
be
in
the
united
states
or
the
plo
had
a
presence
in
the
united
states.
the
person
won't
be
in
the
united
states
very
often.
i
know,
but
sometimes
he
may
come
over
here,
it's
important
to
take
a
--
make
a
symbolic
step
and
not
a
word
could
i
find
when
they
are
talking
even
about
the
word
could
i
find
when
they're
talking
even
about
the
word
person,
that
suggested
they
meant
even
the
plo
at
that
time.
in
fact
they
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
but
--
but
--
i
mean
that's
the
tenor
of
what
i
seem
to
have
found
so
far.
so
i
mention
that,
because
you
will
point
out
to
me
the
things
that
i
accidentally
skipped.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
they
did.
you
see,
i
might
as
well
be
honest
with
you,
page
26
of
the
government's
brief
did
have
an
impact
on
my
thinking.
it's
father
drinan,
and
father
drinan
says
in
the
hearing,
"i
think
it
would
be
best
to
stay
with
that
and
just
avoid
all
of
the
problems
about
the
plo
and
related
groups.
"
and
then
michael
posner
testifies,
it
says,
to
the
government
to
the
same
effect.
so
there,
the
great
advocates
of
this
thing
are
sitting
there
saying
we
don't
think
it
should
cover
the
plo;
let's
not
take
that
step
at
this
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
--
i
mean
--
and
you
have
congressman
leach,
and
then
you
have
the
word
"individual".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he's
taking
that
--
he's
taking
that
--
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
the
obvious
thing
that
they
said
is
look,
just
--
this
is
going
to
bring
in
suits
against
the
palestinian
authority.
that's
a
very
touchy
issue
in
foreign
affairs,
and
we
don't
want
to
have
to
go
that
far.
and
--
and
some
of
the
things
that
are
said
seem
to
bear
that
out.
that's
--
that's
what
is
pulling--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
also
possible
that
it's
not
a
stupid
statute.
[laughter]
i
took
--
i
took
--
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
if
you
want
to
elaborate
on
this
--
because
i
purposely
asked
it.
but
--
but
one
of
the
things
in
the
government's
brief,
it
did
as
i
said
have
an
impact.
but
as
father
drinan
is
asked,
shouldn't
we
have
here
--
this
is
before
it
reads
"individual".
it
reads
plo?
he
responds,
"i
think
that
we
should
exclude
nongovernmental
organizations.
"
"i
think
it
would
be
best
to
stay
with
that
and
just
avoid
all
of
the
problems
about
the
plo
and
related
groups.
"
now
--
but
you
heard
the
response
to
that,
which
really
was,
if
i
look
at
the
context,
i'll
see
that's
less
relevant
than
i
think
--
than
i
did
think.
so
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
they
are
thinking
of
it.
here's
argument
the
other
way,
which
i
see
now,
is
that
--
is
that
look,
father
drinan
and
the
others
are
not
talking
about
individual
versus
person;
they
are
talking
about
whether
say,
the
plo
falls
under
color
of
law
of
a
foreign
state.
and
so
they
are
not
thinking
of
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
in
fact
it
does
fall
under
color
of
law
there,
they
don't
care
about
whether
it's
individual
or
person.
they've
never
really
thought
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
one
who
thought
about
it
was
congressman
leach,
and
that
was
four
bills
earlier.
and--
