you
know,
it's
obvious
that
individual
doesn't
usually
mean
what
you
want
it
to
mean.
now
you
have
a
theory
that
they
all
just
read
judge
edwards
and
they
came
in
and
used
"individual"
but
it
seems
actually
that
we
know
where
individual
came
from
in
this
statute.
the
statute
started
out
by
saying
person
and
then
there
was
this
moment
where
one
congressman
said,
i
don't
want
this
to
apply
to
corporations,
and
the
staff
member
said,
i
have
a
great
idea
to
make
sure
it
doesn't
apply
to
corporations,
let's
change
the
word
person
to
individual.
so
that's
the
way
individual
got
into
the
statute.
and
it
got
in
specifically
to
address
this
question.
justice
elena
kagan
and
it
means
what
it
means.
justice

but
let's
suppose
that
is
true,
mr.
fisher.
let's
suppose
that
aside
from
congressman
leach,
nobody
thought
about
this
question.
but
we
know
what
the
normal
meaning
of
"individual"
is,
and
you
are
suggesting
--
let's
suppose
that
they
just
--
the
question
of
individual
versus
corporate
liability
was
not
on
their
mind,
but
they
chose
a
word
that
means
something,
and
you
are
suggesting
that
we
should
resort
to
background
norms
that,
you
know,
what
congress
generally
does,
what
it
imposes
liability,
rather
than
the
words
in
the
statute
that
they
passed.
and
why
should
we
do
that?
justice

how
about
non-state
actors?

individuals

justice

it
doesn't
really
need
an
answer.
suppose
we
think
there
is
no
answer
to
that
question
because
congress
didn't
think
about
it
other
than
congressman
leach
who
appears
to
have
thought
about
it
and
reached
the
opposite
result.
most
of
them
didn't
think
about
it.
but
there
you
are.
the
statute
says
what
it
says.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fisher,
one
case
that
you
seem
to
have
on
your
side;
you
don't
have
very
many
but
you
have
this
one,
is
--
is
clinton,
which
--
which
does
read
"individual"
in
the
way
that
you
say,
and
does
it
in
order
to
avoid
an
absurd
result
--
what
the
court
thought
of
as
an
absurd
result.
do
you
think
that
this
statute
is
absurd
if
not
read
your
way?
justice
elena
kagan
but
miss
ferguson,
your
story
makes
it
sound
as
though
everybody
was
really
focused
on
this
question,
and
made
a
determination
to
proceed
incrementally
and
not
to
include
foreign
nations.
isn't
it
--
if
you
--
if
you
look
at
what
happened
here,
more
likely
that
other
than
congressman
lynch
--
leech
--
in
fact,
nobody
was
focused
on
this
question.
but
because
of
congressman
leech's
intervention,
the
words
changed,
and
the
word
was
continued
throughout
the
legislative
process.
and
that's
the
word
that
was
voted
on.
