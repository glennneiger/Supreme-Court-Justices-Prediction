mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
a
jail
may
strip
search
an
arrestee
in
cases
of
reasonable
suspicion.
that
is
the
rule
that
was
applied
throughout
almost
the
entire
country
in
the
3
decades
after
bell
v.
wolfish,
without
either
administrative
difficulty
or
any
apparent
increase
in
smuggling.
we
are
here
today,
of
course,
because
both
the
burlington
jail
and
the
essex
county
jail
require
every
arrestee
to
stand
2
feet
in
front
of
a
correctional
officer
and
strip
naked.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
do
apply
it
to
all
arrestees.
the
respondents
in
the
u.s.
bureau
of
prisons
do
draw
a
line
at
major
versus
minor
offenders.
i
think
they
do
that
because
they
think
that
people
who
commit
more
serious
crimes
might
be
inclined
to
greater
criminality.
but
our
rule
is
one
of
reasonable
suspicion.
our
question
presented
draws
the
line
at
minor
offenders
because
this
class
definition
is
only
people
who
were
arrested
for
minor
offenses.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
in
the
view
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
this
question,
absolutely.
in
our
view--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
and,
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
category
--
there
is
a
categorical
rule,
and
that
is
--
that
was
adopted
by
these
respondents,
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
four
court
of
appeals,
that
says:
if
you
are
arrested
for
a
more
serious
offense,
categorically
there
exists
reasonable
suspicion.
our
case
by
case
rule,
it's
true,
applies
with
respect
to
minor
offenders.
and
again,
that
was
the
class
that
was
defined
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think
you
will
have
to
ask
--
i
know
you
want
me
to
answer
the
question.
let
me
just
be
very
clear.
this
is
their
rule.
the
respondents
draw
the
major-minor
offense
line.
the
respondents
apply
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
now,
in
my
view--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
if
the
jail
made
that
judgment,
we
would
think
that
a
court
would
not
overturn
that
judgment.
we
think
that
illustrates
that,
by
contrast
to
when
someone
is
arrested
for
not
paying
a
fine,
that
there
is
no
justification
whatsoever,
because
the
logic
of
their
own
policy
is
that
this
is
a
person
who's
inclined
to
violence.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
a
couple
of
points,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
it's
an
incredibly
important
issue.
they
don't
have
a
blanket
rule.
remember,
the
respondents
apply
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
they
do
strip
everyone
naked,
but
if
they
are
going
to
look
for
contraband,
that
is
look
at
the
person's
mouth,
look
at
their
anus,
they
apply
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
now,
to
your
various
concern
that
maybe
we
are
inviting
discrimination
or
at
least
an
appearance
of
discrimination,
remember
that
their
rule
is
going
to
produce
more
of
that
problem
than
ours,
because
their
rule
is
not
that
they
have
to
stitch
strip
--
they
have
to
strip
search
everyone
for
contraband,
but
their
rule
is
they
can,
they
can
make
a
choice.
this
court
in
the
fourth
--
they
say
we--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
okay.
well
then,
first
let
me
say
i
hope
not.
i
hope
that
your
rule
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard,
which
is
the
rule
that
was
applied
almost
everywhere
in
the
wake
of
bell
v.
wolfish,
without--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
exactly.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
showering
in
the
presence
of
officers
is
not
something
that
requires
reasonable
suspicion.
the
courts
have
uniformly
concluded
that
if
you
are
just
generally
in
an
area
in
which
you
are
being
monitored
by
the
officers,
that's
not
a
fourth
amendment
search
that
violates
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
this
is
different.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
are
two
different
scenarios.
one
is
a
common
room
where
everyone
is
standing
around
and
for
jail
security
purposes--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--a
common
room,
a
common
shower
area,
and
of
course
for
security
purposes.
this
is
different,
justice
ginsburg.
you
asked
what
is
prohibited
in
the
absence
of
reasonable
suspicion.
what
is
prohibited
is
standing
2
feet
away
from
the
person--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
what
is
permitted
is
anything
--
what
is
not
subject
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard
is
anything
other
than
looking
at
a
close
inspection
of
the
person
at
arm's
length.
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
recognized
and
the
lower
courts
and
what
the
literature
recognizes
and
really
what
i
think
concerned
this
court
in
the
safford
case
is
that
when
you
are
standing
so
close
to
the
person
inspecting
their
genitals,
looking
directly
at
their
most
private
parts
of
their
bodies,
that
is
a
direct
intrusion
on
their
individual
privacy--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
don't
think
that
the
courts
have
had
to
confront
5
feet
versus
2
feet.
what
they
have
confronted
is,
they
acknowledge
that
jails
are
places
that
require
security
and
so
if
you
are
just
observing
a
shower
room
that
does
not
implicate
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
i'm--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
it's
the
closeness
of
it.
there
is
not
a
problem,
i
think,
with
the
question
of
2,
3,
4,
or
5
feet.
these
searches
all
occur
in
the
same
way,
and
that
is
the
officer
stands
directly
in
front
of
you.
the
testimony
here
is
2
feet
away.
that
seems
to
be
the
common--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
2
versus
10
feet
away
or
just
generally
observing
the
room.
this
is
exactly--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
can.
so
let
me
just
say,
let
me
try
and
close
up
my
answer
to
the
question
of
the
5
versus
10
feet
and
then
turn
immediately
to
this
visual
body
cavity
search.
remember,
this
is
--
the
court
will
recall
that
this
is
a
reprise
of
the
argument
in
the
safford
case,
where
the
schools
there
argued
that,
well,
there
is
an
observation
of
these
students
in
gym
class,
they
shower
together
naked,
they
undress
naked.
and
the
court
said
it's
quite
different
when
you're
standing
right
there
looking
over
the
student.
and
so
that's
what
implicates
a
fourth
amendment
right
of
privacy,
and
the
distinction
did
make
sense.
as
to
your
question,
yes,
there
is
a
material
difference,
we
think,
although
we
think
both
should
be
covered
by
our
rule.
but
a
visual
body
cavity
inspection
as
occurred
in
the
essex
facility
here,
where
you
require
someone
to
bend
over
and
cough,
which
is
what
the
testimony
is
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct.
--that
after
the
second
jail
had
a
slightly
different
search
protocol,
in
which
the
testimony
is
that
he
was
required
to
bend
over
and
cough
and
expose
his
anus
for
inspection,
and
the
respondents
themselves
regard
that
as
a
more
significant
intrusion
and
they
apply
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard
themselves
to
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
don't
believe
that
the
premise
is
correct.
if
you
read
history
differently
than
me,
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
persuade
you.
but
our
understanding
of
the
history
is
that
the
closest
they
can
come
to
is
two
things:
first,
that
people
were
strip
searched
upon
arrest,
and
that
certainly
is
not
the
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment;
and
that
in
certain
jails
at
the
time
of
the
founding
other
inmates
in
a
process
of
ablution
which,
as
almost
kind
of
a
ritual
cleansing,
would
strip
search
new
inmates.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
jail
officials
themselves
or
trying
to
intercept
contraband.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
first,
it
wasn't
a
nearly
--
the
nearly
uniform
practice
that
i
think
your
question
assumes.
and
it's
just
a
different
kettle
of
fish
entirely,
that
--
we
don't
believe,
obviously,
that
that
historical
lesson
obtains
today
that
the
prisoners
can
strip
search
new
inmates,
new
arrestees
as
they
come
in.
i
do
agree
with
the
basic
premise
of
your
question
that
it's
--
our
position
can't
just
be
that,
hey,
i've
got
a
reasonable
rule.
i
do
have
to
in,
either
under
the
terms
of
bell
v.
wolfish
or
turner
v.
safley,
establish
that
this
is
an
exaggerated
response,
that
this
is
much
more,
materially
more
than
is
necessary
to
accomplish
their
goals.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
justice
ginsburg,
we
disagree
with
that.
at
least
as
to
the
second
search,
we
think
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
degree
of
intrusion
here
and
in
bell.
but
there
is
another
significant
reason
not
just
in
the
nature
of
the
search,
but
a
big
difference
between
this
case
and
bell
is
that
the
inmates
in
that
case
made
a
voluntary
choice.
they
decided
to
have
the
contact
visit
that
was--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
do
not.
i
tried
everything
i
could
to
check
the
record
of
that
case
and
there
was
no
record
of
an
admission
strip
search
at
the
mcc
at
the
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
it
is
not.
we
contend
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibited
the
visual
body
cavity
search
at
the
essex
facility.
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
say
that
under
their
written
policy
they
should
have,
but
they
didn't.
the
burlington
county
--
the
only
evidence
about
a
conclusion
of
the
jail
about
reasonable
suspicion
is
that
the
burlington
county
intake
officer
filled
out
a
form
saying
there
is
no
reasonable
suspicion
here.
and
essex
i
don't
believe
contends
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
to
engage
in
a
visual
body
cavity
search.
they
deny,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
it
happened.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
--
i
do
with
respect
to
the
essex
--
i
apologize
--
no.
what
happened
here
is
that
essex
after
this
search
occurred,
and
this
is
described
in
the
essex
brief
in
opposition,
in
case
you
want
to
look
at
it
later,
at
3
in
note
1
--
essex
after
the
search
in
this
case
changed
its
policy.
we
were
denied
an
injunction
going
forward
under
l.a.
v.
lyons,
so
we
--
it's
just
a
question
of
damages
for
the
search
that
occurred
at
the
time
under
their
old
policy.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
does
not.
the
--
and
--
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
exactly
right.
the
very
close
inspection
of
the
individual's
genitals,
which
can
occur
absolutely
so
long
as
there
is
some
minimal
level
of
suspicion
that's
created.
i
do
want
to
return
to
justice
kennedy's
concern
about
dignitary
interests
here
and
whether
drawing
any
sort--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
burlington
county,
there
is
a
dispute
about
the
so-called
genital
lift,
whether
mr.
florence
was
required
to
lift
his
genitals
or
not.
there
is
no
dispute
that
he
was
required
directly
in
front
of
an
officer
to
strip
naked,
despite
the
officer
having
made
a
finding,
which
is
on
page
390
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion
to
conduct
a
strip
search.
that
is
the
only
factual
dispute--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
the
entire
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear.
what
the
record
says
is
that
for
the
first
few
days
of
his
stay
--
remember,
he
inexplicably
was
kept
for
6
days.
for
the
first
several
days,
he
was
kept
in
a
cell
with
only
one
other
inmate,
or
possibly
two,
and
one
time
he
had
lunch
with
other
people.
in
essex,
he
was
admitted
to
the
general
population.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
because
it
depends
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
phrase
"possession
of
a
deadly
weapon",
as
this
case
illustrates.
the
record
shows
that
the
possession
of
the
deadly
weapon
--
and
that's
why
this
charge
was
not
pursued
by
the
state
--
is
--
was
that
he
was
pulled
over
at
a
traffic
stop
and
he
drove
away.
the
deadly
weapon
is
the
car--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
justice
sotomayor.
the
rap
sheet
does
not
contain
that
charge.
what
the
rap
sheet
does
show,
and
we
are
perfectly
fine
with
them
looking
at
the
rap
sheet
--
the
rap
sheet,
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
--
the
rap
sheet
says
that
he
had
a
single
charge,
he
pleaded
guilty,
he
got
a
term
of
probation.
there
is
nothing
about
that
the
jail
would
have
had
any
information
suggesting
that
he
had
some
charge
involving
a
deadly
weapon.
and
that's
why
they
themselves
certified
that
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sure.
first,
that
is
not
the
view
of
the
jails
in
this
case.
remember,
they
apply
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
they
did
not
find
any
concern
in
their
own
policies
--
neither
does
the
marshals
service,
ice,
with
this
prospect
of
some
prior
offense.
as
to
what
the
rule
is,
and
how
common
it
is
and
whether
this
works
in
practice,
the
jails
here
did
look
him
up
in
the
new
jersey
criminal
justice
information
system.
that's
in
the
record.
they
are
required
by
new
jersey
law
to
do
that.
it's
a
--
every
single
one
of
these
jails
has
computer
access
to
the
njcjis,
and
also
to
the
ncic;
they
just
type
in
his
identifying
information.
they
were
able
to
pull
him
up
without
any
difficulty,
and
they
have
not
complained
that
they
didn't
have
enough
information
about
him.
they
filled
out
a
form
saying
there
is
no
reasonable
suspicion
here.
and
remember,
our
rule
only
operates
in
a
system,
justice
kennedy,
in
which
the
jail
does
have
enough
information.
when
--
our
point
is
this:
if
the
jail
has
the
facts,
as
it
did
here,
to
affirmatively
determine
that
there
is
no
reasonable
suspicion,
which
is
what
they
decided
about
mr.
florence,
then
it
is
an
extraordinary
intrusion
on
dignity
and
autonomy
to
strip
him
naked
when
they
have
no
reason
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
there
is
because
they
do
this
already.
they
--
it
is
not
an
administrative
problem.
they
apply
our
rule
today.
remember,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
he
arrived
at
the
burlington
county
jail,
they
did
an
assessment
of
him
and
determined
that
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion.
the
jails
in
this
case
did
pull
up
his
prior
criminal
history,
and
they
have
no
problem
doing
that.
they
apply
our
standard
today.
it
is
not
a
difficult
one.
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
have
two
explanations--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
block
establishes
that
you
have
no
right
whatsoever
to
have
contact
visits,
so
under
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte,
of
course,
you
can
say
i
voluntarily
relinquish
my
fourth
amendment
right
in
exchange
for
this
privilege.
but
i
have
a
second--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
i
believe
that
that's
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
law.
i
do
have
a
second
point,
though.
and
that
is
that
the
principal
reason
underlying
bell
v.
wolfish's
holding
that
those
searches
were
reasonable
is
that
it
was
essential
to
deter
smuggling,
and
that
deterrence
rationale
has
much
more
of
an
attenuated
relationship
to
this
case.
remember
that
the
inmate
in
that
case
was
having
a
planned
meeting
with
someone,
and
the
representation
of
the
government
is
that
our
problem
is
if
you
plan
to
have
somebody
come
visit
you
and
you
are
going
to
have
a
contact
visit,
you
can
plan
for
them
to
try
and
sneak
something
to
you.
this
court
has
set--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
can
i
just
read
to
you
what
the
court
said
about
that,
just
so
--
the
court
did
have
a
slightly
different
take,
i
think.
and
this
is
from
page
559
of
--
of
the
court's
opinion:
"that
there
has
been
only
one
instance
where
an
mcc
inmate
was
discovered
attempting
to
smuggle
contraband
into
the
institution
on
this
person
may
be
more
a
testament
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
search
technique
as
a
deterrent
than
to
any
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
inmates
to
secrete
and
import
such
items
when
the
opportunity
arises.
"
and
our
point
is
that
that
--
when
you
have
an
unexpected
arrest
here
--
remember,
mr.
florence
showed
the
paperwork
that
he
was
not
wanted
for
arrest.
and
that's
going
to
be
generally
true
in
all
kinds
of
traffic
stops
and
the
like--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
that's
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
just
a
debate
about
words.
we
think
that
is
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
our
rule
that
we
would
expect
is
that,
with
respect
to
minor
offenders,
that's
when
you
assess--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
i
think
that
is
a
great
question
for
them,
because
that's
their
rule.
they
have
a
rule
that
says
for
minor
offender
that
you
have
to
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
search
for
contraband.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
that's
right.
because
this
case
only
involves
minor
offenders,
we
have
articulated
a
rule
with
respect
to
minor
offenders.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
for
3
decades
the
rule
that
was
articulated
by
the
federal
courts
and
applied
without
difficulty
is
one
that
says
for
minor
offenses.
when
that
was
applied
in
practice
it
was
basically
done
at
a
felony
versus
misdemeanor
line.
the
court
accepted
that
if
you
are
--
the
courts
accepted
that
if
you
are
suspected
of
a
more
serious
offense,
then
for
administrative
reasons
and
because
we
just
think
you
might
be
engaged
in
more
criminality,
then
you
don't
have
to
have
any
individualized
inquiry
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
not
correct.
that
aspect
--
what
the
testimony
in
this
case
establishes
is
that
the
jail
guards
allow
any
sort
of
medical
rationale
for
the
search
to
be
conducted
by
medical
personnel,
not
by
the
guards
themselves.
all
these
inmates
are
examined
by
a
medical
person,
a
nurse
or
the
like,
and
they
are
responsible
for
--
for--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
--
it
can
be
the
line
and
it
is
the
line
that
has
been
accepted
for
decades.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
the
intake
process,
the
testimony
is
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
i
apologize,
justice
kennedy.
i'm
telling
you
what
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
and
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
i'm
saying
that
a
close
inspection
which
is
intended
to
examine
the
person's
individual--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--genitals,
and
whether
it's
at
2
feet
or
4
feet
i
don't
think
is
the
relevant
line.
if
i
could
make
one
point,
and
then
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
would
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
that's
right,
but
if
that
is
right,
what
happens
is
that
medical
professionals
are
the
people
who
are
assigned
that
responsibility.
that's
the
testimony
in
this
case.
the
only
last
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
--
i
agree.
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--if
that's
what
they're
doing,
i
think
that
that
is
okay.
the
courts
have
said
that
that
is
not
itself
a
--
because
of
the
prospect
of
handling
that
problem
with
shampoo,
which
is
what
these
jails
do,
that
that's
not
a
sufficient
--
a
sufficient
justification
to
require
the
person
to
strip
naked.
the
only
other
point
that
i
did
want
to
make
is
that
this
is
the
rule,
not
just
at
burlington
and
essex,
but
also
of
the
u.s.
marshal
service,
which
has
the
intake
of
220,000
inmates
every
year,
and
also
of
the
bureau
of
immigration
customs
enforcement,
which
intakes
384,000
a
year.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
not
correct.
that
is
only
the
policy
of
the
u.s.
bureau
of
prisons,
which
has
an
intake
of
minor
offenders
of
only
a
few
thousand
people
a
year.
for
the
marshals
service
and
for
ice,
which
have
a
combined
600,000
people
every
year,
they
do
not
have
that
separate
housing
rule.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
--
if
the
--
we
do,
because
they
still
have
to
stand
naked
directly
in
front
of
the
correctional
officer
under
the
superseding
policy.
what
the
superseding
policy
is,
which
is
burlington's
policy
throughout
this,
is
that
they
will
not
search
the
person
for
contraband,
which
is
their
supposed
interest
here,
for
contraband,
in
the
absence
of
reasonable
suspicion.
both
jails
at
the
time
of
this
search
and
also
now
will
still
require
the
person
to
strip
naked,
supposedly
for
contraband,
even
though
their
own
policy
says
we
won't
search
for
--
we
won't
engage
in
the
depth
of
search
that
is
required,
we
won't
look
at
the
anus,
we
won't
look
in
the
person's
mouth,
in
the
absence
of
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
the
current
policy.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
do
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
sir.
i
have
three
points
to
make.
the
first
is
that
my
friend
from
the
united
states
says
defer
to
the
experts.
but
the
point
that
the
united
states
consistently
omits
is
that
there
are
600,000
offenders
that
go
into
the
federal
system
every
year.
i
don't
understand
the
claim
that
one
--
this
only
involves
1
percent
of
federal
offenders.
the
marshal
service
and
ice
admit
600,000
offenders
every
year
under
our
standard.
they
are
not
kept
in
separate
housing.
these
are
cited
in
our
brief.
600,000
people,
is
their
expert
judgment,
are
subject
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard
when
they
are
admitted
to
jail.
the
second
point
about
numbers,
justice
breyer,
there
is
a
significant
empirical
study,
and
that
is,
the
county
of
orange
case,
the
district
judge
there
did
an
unbelievable
detailed
job
going
through
the
record
of
26,000
admissions
into
the
system
and
was
able
to
identify
only
a
single
instance
where
contraband
would
have
gotten
in
under
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
there
is
also
evidence
in
this
case,
and
the
evidence,
to
my
surprise,
that
my
friends
keep
pointing
to,
there
is
a
memorandum
from
the
essex
jail
system.
it's
at
page
70a
to
71s
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
it
tells
you
two
really
relevant
things.
it
says,
every
year
they
admit
25,175
people
into
this
jail,
and
that
they
only
found
14
instances
of
contraband.
and
they
don't
even
make
the
claim
that
those
14
instances
out
of
25,000
would
not
have
been
found
under
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
so
you
have
evidence
in
this
record
about
this
particular
case.
third,
a
couple
of
points
have
been
made
about
whether,
justice
breyer,
you
asked
whether
someone
who
is
high
on
drugs.
the
uniform
rule,
and
this
is
not
just
the
aba
but
the
expert
standard
of
the
american
correctional
association,
what
they
say
is
that
essentially
--
almost
anything
will
do.
what
will
not
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion
is
when
you
have
a
minor
offender,
and
we
do
have
--
there
are
700,000
people
in
jail
in
the
united
states
every
year
for
misdemeanor
offenses.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are
having
a
very
significant
intrusion
on
privacy
and
the
expert
standard,
the
rule
that
was
applied
under
bell
v.
wolfish
is
when
you
have
people
who
come
in
on
a
minor
offense,
they
don't
have
any
drug
history.
they
are
not
high
on
drugs.
there
was
no
opportunity
to
hide
a
weapon.
i'm
not
sure
where
they
think
the
gun
is
going
to
be
hidden
that
is
not
going
to
show
up
in
the
very
close
manual
pat
down
that
they
do
of
every
one
of
these
people
that
isn't
going
to
show
up
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
first,
there
are
real
categories
that
are
overinclusive
in
favor
of
the
jails,
like
if
it's
a
serious
offense
or
if
they
have
any
drug
history.
and
then
on
top
of
that,
if
there
is
any
individualized
basis
that
the
jails
can
articulate,
that
will
do
as
well.
we
are
not
saying
that
categorically
people
will
be
excluded
from
being
searched.
we
are
saying
that
there
are
entire
categories
that
is
will
automatically
be
searchable.
we
are
just
saying
don't
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
bath
water.
when
somebody
is
pulled
over
like
mr.
florence
and
there's
just
--
it's
laugh
out
loud
funny
to
think
he
is
smuggling
in
--
something
into
this
jail;
that
it's
too
much
of
an
intrusion
to
put
him
under
the
direct,
you
know,
two
feet
away,
i'm
going
to
look
at
your
genitals,
as
opposed
to
the
ordinary
intrusion
of
saying
we
are
going
to
oversee
the
showers.
there
is
no
when
it
comes
to
that
group
of
people.
and
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
they
represent
anything
like
a
material
threat
of
smuggling.
and
this
is
a
significant
intrusion
on
individual
privacy
and
individual
dignity.
thank
you.
