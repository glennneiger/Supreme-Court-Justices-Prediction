justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
reasonable
suspicion
test
more
easily
met
if
it's
a
felon
detained
for
a
serious
felony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
are
going
on
a
case
by
case
basis
based
on
the
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
--
i
take
it
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
protect
the
individual
dignity
of
the
detainee.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
risk
compromising
that
individual
dignity
if
you
say
we
have
reasonable
suspicion
as
to
you,
but
not
as
to
you.
you
are
just
setting
us
up.
and
you
are
setting
the
detainee
up
for
a
classification
that
may
be
questioned
at
the
time,
and
will
be
seen
as
an
affront
based
on
the
person's
race,
based
on
what
he
said
or
she
said
to
the
officers
coming
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
that
your
rule
imperils
individual
dignity
in
a
way
that
the
blanket
rule
does
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
their
rule
or
our
rule.
ultimately
it's
going
to
be
our
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
common?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
rap
sheet
always
available
immediately?
i
thought
it
was
rather
common
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong;
it's
based
on
practice
some
years
ago
--
that
it
--
it
would
take
maybe
24
hours,
48
hours
for
the
wiretap
--
for
the
wire
services
and
the
internet
to
--
to
report
that
he's
wanted
for
questioning
for
some
very,
very
serious
crime
in
some
other
state?
i
think
--
in
my
practice
at
least
--
county
jails
were
much
more
dangerous
than
penitentiaries,
because
you
don't
know
who
these
people
are.
you
arrest
them
for
traffic
and
they
may
be
some
serial
killer.
you
do
not
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
you
--
you
would
have
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--keep
the
person
in
custody,
say,
for
24,
48
hours
until
the
medical
personnel
could
come.
do
you
have
24-hour
medical
personnel
for
intakes
that
are
2
in
the
morning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
--
you
are
telling
us
that
every
county
jail
in
--
in
the
united
states
has
medical
personnel
on
duty
24
hours
a
day
ready
to
do
a
--
a
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
record
or
common
experience
justify
an
argument
that
if
you
have
the
person
who's
stopped
just
for
a
traffic
ticket,
but
that
person
is
going
to
be
in
custody
for
five
or
six
days,
that
person
might
well
prefer
an
institution
where
everyone
has
been
searched
before
he
or
she
is
put
into
the
population
with
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
most
of
the
general
proposition
that
your
side
is
advancing,
but
i
have
to
say,
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
evidence,
the
amount
of
contraband
that
was
discovered
and
the
amount
of
weapons
that
was
discovered
that
is
in
the
literature
and
citations
was
somewhat
skimpy.
i
thought
there
would
be
a
stronger
showing
than
i
found
in
the
briefs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
the
court
considers
the
extent
to
which
the
constitution
imposes
restrictions
on
jail
officials
who
search
incoming
detainees.
the
petitioner
is
albert
florence
and
he
presses
claims
for
himself
and
a
larger
class.
in
1998,
florence
was
arrested
after
attempting
to
flee
from
police
officers.
he
pled
guilty
to
two
offenses
and
was
sentenced
by
a
new
jersey
state
court
to
pay
a
fine
in
installments.
when
he
fell
behind
on
his
payments
and
failed
to
appear,
a
judge
issued
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
florence
then
paid
the
balance
but
the
warrant
remained
in
a
state-wide
computer
database.
some
seven
years
later,
the
events
that
give
rise
to
this
case
occurred.
florence
and
his
wife
were
stopped
in
their
car
by
a
new
jersey
state
trooper.
based
on
the
outstanding
warrant,
florence
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
burlington
county
detention
center.
he
was
held
there
for
six
days
and
then
transferred
to
the
essex
county
correctional
center.
he
was
released
a
day
later
after
the
charges
were
dropped.
at
the
outset
of
his
detention
in
each
of
the
two
facilities,
florence
was
subjected
to
a
thorough
--
thorough
search,
sometimes
called
a
strip
search.
the
searches
did
not
involve
any
touching
or
probing
of
the
unclothed
detainee,
yet
the
two
searches
were
thorough
and
no
doubt
intrusive.
at
the
burlington
facility,
jail
policy
required
every
arrestee
to
shower
with
a
delousing
soap.
officers
would
check
for
scars,
gang
tattoos
and
contraband
as
the
arrestee
or
detainee
disrobed.
florence
claims
he
was
also
instructed
to
open
his
mouth,
lift
his
tongue,
hold
out
his
arms,
turn
around
and
lift
his
genitals.
after
being
transferred
to
the
essex
facility,
he
was
subject
to
a
second
similar
search
and
the
details
are
set
out
in
the
opinion.
florence
alleges
that
during
this
second
search,
he
was
required
to
lift
his
genitals,
turn
around
and
cough
in
a
squatting
position.
florence
brought
a
section
1983
suit
for
violations
of
his
fourteenth
and
fourth
amendment
rights
alleging
an
awful
search.
he
maintained
that
persons
arrested
for
a
minor
offense
cannot
be
required
to
remove
their
clothing
and
submit
to
a
close
visual
inspection
as
a
routine
part
of
the
intake
process.
rather
he
contends
officials
make
--
conduct
this
kind
of
search
only
if
they
have
reason
to
suspect
a
particular
inmate
of
concealing
a
weapon
or
drugs
or
concealing
other
contraband.
the
district
court
agreed.
the
united
states
court
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
a
search
--
that
the
search
procedures
at
issue
struck
a
reasonable
balance
between
inmate
privacy
and
the
needs
of
the
two
jails.
this
court
now
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
difficulties
of
operating
a
detention
center
must
not
be
under
estimated
by
the
courts.
jail
officials
have
a
responsibility
to
ensure
the
security
of
their
facilities
when
detainees
are
admitted.
this
is
not
an
easy
task.
jails
admit
13
million
inmates
a
year.
now,
the
largest
facilities
process
hundreds
of
people
everyday,
even
smaller
jails
can
be
crowded
on
weekend
nights
or
after
a
large
police
operation.
some
detainees
are
gang
members,
others
may
have
contagious
infection,
and
some
of
them
possess
a
knife
or
drugs
or
other
contraband.
correctional
officers
have
discretion
to
use
their
expertise
to
devise
reasonable
solutions
to
the
problems
they
face.
now,
the
precedents
of
this
court
have
established
that
deference
was
given
to
the
judgment
of
correctional
officers
that
these
thorough
searches
serve
not
only
to
discover
but
also
to
deter
the
smuggling
of
contraband
into
detention
facilities.
the
cases
have
recognized
that
this
deterrence
depends
in
part
on
the
ability
to
conduct
search
without
predictable
exceptions.
it
is
true
that
some
people
are
held
in
jail
for
a
minor
offense.
and
florence
argues
they
should
be
exempt
from
the
general
search
policies
here
at
issue.
he
argues
that
absent
a
reasonable
suspicion,
officers
should
be
prohibited
from
conducting
a
so-called
strip
search
of
someone
who
is
not
been
arrested
for
an
offense
that
involves
a
weapon
or
drugs
or
as
otherwise
considered
serious.
it
is
reasonable,
however,
for
correctional
officials
to
find
this
framework
unworkable,
but
one
thing,
people
detained
for
a
minor
offense
can
turn
out
to
be
the
most
dangerous
criminals.
timothy
mcveigh
was
stopped
for
a
traffic
offense
before
it
was
determined
he
was
a
perpetrator
of
the
oklahoma
city
bombing.
and
there
are
many
examples
of
people
arrested
for
minor
offenses,
trying
to
bring
contraband
into
jail,
sometimes
by
using
their
body
cavities.
in
fact,
an
exception
for
the
standard
search
protocol
for
minor
offenders
would
increase
the
risk
of
their
being
coerced
by
others
into
hiding
prohibited
items.
another
problem
is
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
classify
inmates
by
their
current
and
prior
offenses
before
the
intake
search.
criminal
history
records
may
be
inaccurate,
incomplete
or
difficult
to
obtain.
and
even
with
all
the
facts,
it
could
be
difficult
for
officers
to
know
on
the
spot
whether
a
prior
offense
is
a
constitutional
matter
serious
enough
to
authorize
the
searches
here.
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
do
not
require
the
restrictions
florence
proposes.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
has
joined
all
but
part
iv
of
the
court's
opinion.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
alito
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor
and
kagan
join.
