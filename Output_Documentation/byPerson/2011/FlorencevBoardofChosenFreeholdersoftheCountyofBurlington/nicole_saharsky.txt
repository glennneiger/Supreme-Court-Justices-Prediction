ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
searches
at
issue
in
bell
are
very
similar
to
the
searches
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
they
should
be
upheld.
i
want
to
start
with
justice
kagan's
question.
it
is
true
that
contact
visits
with
bell
are
different
from
a
person
coming
into
the
jail
for
the
first
time,
in
that
there
might
be
a
greater
opportunity
for
planning,
but
as
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out,
there
was
less
of
an
opportunity
to
actually
get
contraband,
the
person
coming
in
was
going
to
be
searched,
the
inmate,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
was
wearing
a
one-piece
zip-up
jumper,
and
he
was
being
watched
the
entire
time.
the
visit
--
the
contraband
situation
in
this
case
at
intake,
the
person
does
have
an
opportunity,
even
if
they
are
not
self-reporting,
knowing
that
they
are
going
to
be
arrested.
protesters,
for
example,
who
decide
deliberately
to
get
arrested.
they
might
be
stopped
by
the
police,
they
see
the
squad
car
behind
them.
they
might
have
a
gun
or
contraband
in
their
car
and
think
hey,
i'm
going
to
put
that
on
my
person,
i
just
need
to
get
it
somewhere
that
is
not
going
to
be
found
during
a
patdown
search,
and
then
potentially
they
have
the
contraband
with
them.
also,
the
process
of
going
from
the
arrest
--
point
of
arrest
to
the
general
jail
population
is
not
a
quick
one.
the
person
typically
goes,
for
example,
to
a
metropolitan
police
department
--
that
is
what
happens
here
--
and
the
person
would
mix
potentially
there
in
a
holding
cell
with
other
offenders.
if
this
court
for
example
adopted
a
rule
saying
that
minor
offenders
would
not
be
searched
in
a
way
that
other
offenders
would,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
some
offenders
in
those
circumstances,
all
on
the
bus
together
to
go
to
the
general
jail
population,
who
would
give
the
stuff
to
the
minor
offenders--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--to
try
to
get
them
to
bring
it
in.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i'm
sorry
if
that
was
confusing.
the
bureau
of
prisons
policy
is
that
a
prisoner
will
not
be
put
in
the
general
population,
being
allowed
to
mix
with
other
offenders,
unless
he
or
she
has
undergone
the
strip
search--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
people--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--those
people
when
they
go
into
the
jail
would
be
asked
whether
they
are
willing
to
consent
to
this
type
of
search.
in
most
cases,
they
do
consent.
if
they
don't
consent
and
there
is
not
reasonable
suspicion,
then
they
are
not
placed
in
the
general
jail
population;
they
are
kept
separate
from
the
other
offenders.
so
it
is
the
case,
the
rule
that
the
third
circuit
identified
which
is:
a
blanket
policy
that
anyone
that's
going
to
go
into
the
general
jail
population
and
mix
with
everyone
else
has
to
be
strip
searched.
that
is
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons'
policy.
i
should
note
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
the
general
jail
population
has
certain
facilities,
you
know,
computer
facilities
and
others
that
you
don't
get
when
you
are
in
a
cell
by
yourselves.
as
a
practical
matter
this
arises
very
infrequently
in
the
federal
system.
we
are
talking
about
fewer
than
1
percent
of
offenders.
and
the
question
before
the
court
at
this
point
really
is,
you
have
before
you
a
blanket
policy
saying
we
need
to
strip
search
everyone
and
is
that
something
that
is
unreasonable
or
irrational
in
the
way
that
the
court
has
considered
its
normal
deference
to
prison
officials
and
i
just
--
i
would
like--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
there
are
not
empirical
studies
of
this
type
of
information.
typically
it
arises
when
there
are
incidents
at
a
facility
and
incident
reports
are
written
up.
they
are
not
published
regularly.
there
is
not
some
kind
of
laboratory
study
that
you
can
do.
the
facilities
have
an
incident
that
they
try
to
deal
with.
sometimes
it
makes
the
news.
those
are
the
things
that
we
reported.
i
would
hate
for
the
court
to
think
that
there
is
not
evidence
of
people
who
committed
--
minor
offenders
in
the
record
bringing
in
very
serious
things
into
prisons
jails.
i
point
you
to
footnote
15
in
the
government's
brief
which
talks
about
people
being
arrested
for
traffic
offenses
and
smuggling
pipes
in
body
cavities.
i'd
point
the
court
to
both
experts
in
this
case
cited
by
mr.
phillips.
i'd
point
the
court
to
the
record
in
bull,
the
san
francisco
case.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
hazardous
thing
for
courts
to
do
with
20/20
hindsight.
you
know,
the
court
could
look
back
at
individual
offenders
and
might
have
information--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
agree
with
you,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
individuals
who
are
doing
the
searches
at
issue
have
very
limited
information
about
people.
this
is
when
you
have
people
who
are
coming
into
the
first
--
the
system
for
the
first
time.
they
have
had
the
most
contact
with
the
outside
world.
you
have
the
least
amount
of
information
about
them.
in
the
federal
system
you
don't
know--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
may
be
true
but
it's
not
the
information
that
the
people
who
do
intake
and
are
doing
the
searches
have.
they
do
not
have
that
information
on
their
fingertips
in
the
federal
system.
they
have
name,
date
of
birth,
and
the
offense
the
person
was
charged
with.
they
don't
have
anything
else.
and
the
question
before
the
court,
if
i
may,
is
whether
there
are
reasons
for
a
blanket
rule
that
this
court
should
defer
to,
and
i
would
say
there
are
several.
first
of
all
you
cannot
say
that
there
are
some
minor
offenders
that
don't
pose
a
contraband
risk.
they
are
documented
in
the
record.
second
you
have
individuals
who
are
making
very
quick
determination.
they
have
large
numbers
of
people
to
get
through
into
the
general
prison
population.
they
have
very
little
time,
and
if
they
guess
wrong,
those
mistakes
can
be
deadly.
third
the
rule
needs
to
be--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well
there
would
be
contraband
found
that
would
be
found
in
body
cavities.
and
we
have
documented
in
this
record
and
other
records,
in
our
brief
that
there
are
folks
who
do
that,
and
that
contraband
is
not
found
until
they
do
these--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
the
fundamental
question
for
the
court
is
who
is
supposed
to
be
doing
this
line
drawing.
and
you've
said
case
after
case
after
case
after
case
you
are
going
to
defer
to
the
prison
officials
who
have
seen
this
stuff
on
the
ground
day
to
day.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
are
many
good
reasons
to
have
a
policy
to
do
it
for
everyone.
it
is
easily
--
easy
to
administer
when
you
have
lots
of
people.
it
is
done
for
the
protection
of
the
people
like
petitioner
who
don't
want
to
be
knifed
in
the
shower--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
the
federal
government
thinks
that
that
blanket
policy
is
a
good
one.
it
made
one
modification
to
its
policy
in
2003
when
the
weight
of
the
circuits
was
against
it.
but
again
this
is
a
policy
that
is
done
for
everyone's
protection.
a
point
that
justice
kennedy
made
earlier
is
that
there--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes,
to
inspect
everyone
who
would
be
put
in
the
general
jail
population.
that
the
third
circuit's
holding,
and
that
is
what
we
are
defending
in
this
case.
because
when
you
have
a
rule
that
treats
everyone
the
same,
you
don't
have
folks
that
are
singled
out.
you
don't
have
any
security
gaps.
we
urge
you
to
affirm
the
judgment
from
the
court
below.
