justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
would
this
work
with
respect
to
individuals
who
have
been
arrested
for
serious
offenses?
let's
say
someone
has
been
arrested
for
--
for
assault.
say
it's
a
case
of
domestic
violence,
assault.
would
that
be
enough
to
justify
a
search?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand.
you
say
that
you
don't
want
to
draw
that
line;
you
want
to
apply
it
to
everybody.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
the
mere
fact
that
someone
has
been
arrested
for
a
violent
offense
would
in
your
judgment
be
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
confused
about
your--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--your
position.
suppose
a
jurisdiction
has
the
policy
of
requiring
every
inmate
who
is
arrested
and
is
going
to
be
held
in
custody
to
disrobe
and
take
a
shower
and
apply
medication
for
the
prevention
of
the
spread
of
lice
and
is
observed
while
this
is
taking
place
from
some
distance
by
a
corrections
officer,
let's
say
10
feet
away.
is
that
--
does
that
require
a
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
your
--
your
only
concern
is
searches
that
go
further
than
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
just
follow
up
on
that?
is
there
a
dispute
of
fact
as
to
whether
anything
beyond
that
occurred
in
burlington
county?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
say
that
regardless
of
the
offense
for
which
the
person
is
arrested?
there
have
been
some
stories
in
the
news
recently
about
cities
that
have
taken
to
arresting
people
for
traffic
citations.
suppose
someone
is
just
arrested
because
they
have
a
lot
of
tickets
for
being
caught
on
speed
cameras,
let's
say.
that
person
can
be
subjected
to
the
searches
that
you
are
describing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
we
accept
the
petitioner's
concession
that
it
is
permissible
to
require
everybody
who
is
arrested
to
disrobe
and
shower
under
the
observation
of
the
corrections
officer
from
a
certain
distance.
now
the
question
would
become:
how
many
people
who
do
that
will
still
be
able
to
smuggle
in
contraband?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
are
really
arguing
for
an
individualized
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
i
think
you
are
arguing
for
a
rule
that
draws
distinctions
based
on
categories
that
correspond
only
perhaps
very
roughly
to
reasonable
suspicion.
