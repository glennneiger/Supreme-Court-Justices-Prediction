justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldstein,
what
--
what
you
propose
is
reasonable
enough,
i
suppose,
and
some
states
could
adopt
that
kind
of
a
protocol
instead
of
what
they
have.
but
what
you
are
asserting
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
them
from
adopting
it,
and
the
obstacle
i
see
is
that
at
the
time
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted,
this
--
this
was
standard
practice,
to
strip
search
people
who
were
admitted
to
prisons.
so
how
could
it
be
deemed
an
unreasonable
invasion
of
privacy
when
it
--
when
it
was
done
all
the
time
and
nobody
thought
it
was
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
somehow
less
of
an
intrusion
on
your
privacy,
to
be
naked
in
front
of
a
whole
bunch
of
inmates,
rather
than
one
jail
official
inspecting?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
acknowledged
that
we
--
we
have
held
that
when
you
have
visitors,
you
may
be
stripped
--
strip
searched
after
the
visit,
and
the
same
kind
of
close
examination
that
you
object
to
here.
now,
your
explanation
why
that
is
okay
is
that
that
is
voluntary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
don't
have
to
have
visitors.
can
you
really
condition
your
--
your
--
your
having
visitors
on
your
waiver
of
your
fourth
amendment
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
--
are
you
sure
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
--
you
can
condition
certain
--
certain
privileges
upon
a
waiver
of
--
of
constitutional
privileges?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
that
--
i
can
understand
that
for
cavity
searches,
but
--
but
why
for
the
search
to
see
if
--
if
the
person
has
any
fleas
or
cooties
or,
you
know,
any
--
any
other
communicable
disease
before
he
is
put
into
the
general
population?
are
--
are
felons
more
likely
to
have
those
than
non-felons?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
line
makes
no
sense
for
--
for
that
aspect
of
the
search
which
is
--
is
just
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
have
a
clean
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
--
that's
where
the
fourth
amendment
invasion
of
privacy
line
is
to
be
drawn?
if
you're
examined
close
up
by
someone
who
has
a
medical
degree,
it's
okay?
and
on
the
other
hand,
if
it's
someone
who
does
not
have
a
medical
degree,
it's
not
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can't
be
the
line
as
to
whether
your
privacy
is
being
invaded.
justice
antonin
scalia
two
arms'
lengths.
i
mean,
he
could
reach
out,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
we've
just
acknowledged
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
there
is
still
an
--
an
issue
in
the
case
beyond
the
ordinary
visual
inspection,
and
that
is
this,
even
though
you
have
changed
your
policy
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
question
remains
whether
that
change
in
policy
was
constitutionally
required,
so
that
when
--
when
you
treated
the
--
the
plaintiff
in
a
different
fashion
under
the
old
policy,
that
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
doesn't
--
doesn't
that
question
remain
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
the
--
we
have
to
consider
both,
the
pure
visual
and
also
the
inspection
for
contraband.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
that
applies
only
to
squatting
and
coughing.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
[laughter]
