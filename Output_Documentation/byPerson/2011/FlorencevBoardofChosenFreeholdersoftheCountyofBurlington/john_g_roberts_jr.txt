chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-945,
florence
v.
the
board
of
chosen
freeholders
of
the
county
of
burlington.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
is
there
--
there's
a
distinction
between
the
simple
strip
search
and
the
visual
body
cavity
search.
you
say
that
they
apply
reasonable
suspicion
standard
to
the
visual
body
cavity
search.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
the
visual
cavity
search
therefore
off
the
table?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
right.
but
you
would
say
that
they
had
to
have
a
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
before
they
could
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
you
see
a
distinction
between
what
they
actually
do
and
the
written
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel
--
counsel,
my
understanding
of
the
statistics
--
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
is
that
they
get
about
70
new
people
going
through
this
process
a
day.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
how
much
additional
time
it
would
require
to
look
at
each
one,
to
look
at
their
record,
to
determine
which
category
they
should
fall
into,
to
strip
search
or
not,
as
opposed
to
having
a
blanket
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
give
you
rebuttal
time,
but
maybe
just
to
be
clear--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
don't
--
do
you
or
do
you
not
have
an
objection
to
the
superseding
eccf
policy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
the
current
policy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
have
no
problem
with
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
you
have
no
problem
with
the
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
aspect
of
the
body
cavity
search.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
and
with
respect
to
the
simple
strip
search--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
only
objection
is
that
the
guard
is
too
close
to
the
inmate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
thank
you.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
is
the
shower
and
look
at
you
cursorily,
are
those
separate
things?
or
is
it
during
the
shower?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
your
friend
places
a
lot
of
significance
on
how
close
the
examination
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
under
that
policy
how
close
was
the
examination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
right.
they
could
take--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
not
right.
you
could
take
the
clothes
off,
put
them
in
a
bin--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
person
examines
the
bin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
--
i
thought
your
friend
said
that
is
exactly
what
you
do
with
respect
to
the
visual
body
cavity
search,
reasonable
articulable
suspicion,
under
the
new
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
now,
as
i
understand
it,
with
respect
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--with
respect
to
visual
body
cavity
searches,
you
require
a
particular
individual
reason,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
and
you
don't
require
that
with
respect
to
simple
strip
search?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
only
thing
at
issue
here
is
how
close
the
guard
is
going
to
be
to
the
individual
who
you
have
no
reasonable
suspicion
to
think
is
different
from
anybody
else
during
a
simple
strip
search?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want
--
he
says
2
feet
is
too
close,
5
feet
or
whatever
is
okay.
you
want
to
go
to
2
feet.
you
don't
want
to
have
to
stand
back
to
6
feet.
that's
all
the
case
comes
down
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
interested
in
what
essex
policy
permitted
it
to
do
in
the
past.
i
--
i'm
looking
at
the
new
policy,
all
right?
under
the
new
policy,
you
have
reasonable
articulable
suspicion--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--for
everything
except
simple
strip
search
and
observation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
could
i
finish
and
find
out
what
you
do?
you
said
we
don't
do
that.
we
do
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
you
do
more
than
a
simple
strip
search.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sure
i
missed
something.
you
say
when
they
go
in
they
are
asked:
will
you
consent
to
a
more
intrusive
body
cavity
search
and
be
put
into
the
general
population;
or
if
you
don't,
you
don't
have
to
be
searched
and
we
put
you
in
some
place
else.
who
consents
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein,
take
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-945,
florence
versus
the
board
of
chosen
freeholders.
