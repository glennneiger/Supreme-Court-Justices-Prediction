justice

--mr.
goldstein,
there
of
course
were
guards
there
who
were
watching
the
visits.
and
as
i
understand
that
case,
there
was
really
no
empirical
evidence
that
smuggling
came
about
as
a
result
of
these
visits.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips,
if
i
could
understand
your
position,
you
think
that
there
is
no
reasonable
suspicion
even
for
that
more
intrusive
body
cavity
search,
is
that
right.
justice
elena
kagan
and
does
it
matter
to
you
whether
the
person
is
being
introduced
into
the
general
prison
population,
or
would
you
also
say
that
if
the
person
is
not
being
introduced
into
the
general
prison
population?
do
you
still
think
that
there
is
no
reasonable
suspicion
requirement?
justice

manual

--the
one
significant
difference
between
bell
and
this
case
was
that
in
bell,
there
was
a
real
opportunity
for
people
to
plan,
to
conspire
together
to
bring
in
contraband.
here,
you
are
talking
about
somebody
who
is
arrested
on
the
spot,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
planning,
for
conspiracy
with
respect
to
contraband,
is
there?
