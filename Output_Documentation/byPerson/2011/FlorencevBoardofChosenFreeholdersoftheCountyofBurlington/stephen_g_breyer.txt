justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
which
is
it
you're
doing?
i
mean,
i
imagine
--
i
thought
you
were
saying
you
always
need
a
reasonable
suspicion,
so
i
imagine
a
case
where
the
person
is
going
to
be
arrested,
put
into
the
general
prison
population,
there
is
a
warrant
out
against
him
for
second-degree
murder,
and
the
policeman
stopping
him
for
a
traffic
offense
arrests
him
because
he
knows
he
is
wanted
on
a
warrant
in
another
place,
and
the
jail
has
a
policy
that
says
when
you're
--
come
in
here
because
of
second-degree
murder,
we
strip
search.
okay?
can
they
do
that
under
your
rule
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
they
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
do
not
want
to
--
then
you
are
not
saying
it
always
has
to
be
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
all
right.
that
isn't
helping
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
helps
me
is
to
know
what
the
category
of
things
is
that
the
jail
in
your
opinion
is
going
to
have
to
look
into
the
characteristics
of
this
individual
person,
and
when
i
look
at
the
aba,
they
talked
about
minor
arrests.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
i
look
at
some
of
the
cases,
there
is
a
long
list,
like
violence,
drugs,
and
so
forth,
where
you
don't
have
to,
where
you
can
just
use
the
general
fact
that
he
was
arrested--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
the
thing.
but
there
are
other
ones,
minor
ones,
where
you
do.
so
what
is
your
rule
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
the
next
question
which
we'll
get--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
is
a
minor
offender
and
how
do
you
administer
that
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that
of
course--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unfortunately,
i'm
asking
you
and
not
them,
and
--
and
it's
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
want
us
to
write
this
so
that
jail
personnel
all
over
the
country--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
to
be
able
to
follow
it
and
know
exactly
what
they
are
supposed
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
said
before
was
2
feet
is
too
close,
but
5
feet
is
okay.
are
you
sticking
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
visual
observation
for
more
than
2
feet,
or
less
than
2
feet?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happened?
do
we
know?
was
it
within
2
feet
or
not
within
2
feet?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
try
the
aba.
the
aba
is
minor
offenses,
not
drugs,
not
violence,
and
there
you
have
to
have
reasonable
suspicion.
now,
i've
read
through
the
briefs
and
i
can't
find
a
lot
of
contrabanders
that
were
caught
in
that
category.
in
fact,
my
law
clerk
thinks
it's
one
out
of
64,000
or
less.
so
--
so
what
is
the
justification
for
a
rule
to
avoid
reasonable
suspicion
in
that
category?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
conclusion,
and
we
have
a
lot
of
practical
experience
because
different
states
have
different
rules
and
san
francisco
came
in
with
i
think
the
toughest
on
your
side,
for
your
side.
i
just
say,
looking
through
that,
it's
very
hard
to
find
somebody
who
really
was
in
this
minor
offender
category,
who
really
was
found
to
have
contraband.
so
what
should
i
look
at
to
show
that
my
initial
reaction
from
the
quick
reading
is
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
just
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
evidence
--
i
count
seven
or
eight
states
anyway
that
have
some
variation
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
rule
like
what
they
want
--
roughly.
is
there
any
evidence
at
all
that
in
those
seven
or
eight
states,
there
is
more
contraband
being
smuggled
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
my
--
that
is
my
problem.
you
--
i
overstated
the
strength
of
your
evidence.
i
was
just
trying
to
throw
it
out,
but
i
understated
it.
san
francisco's
point
is
really
the
30
to
60
percent
or
some
very
high
percentage
of
people
who
come
in
for
minor
crimes
are
high
on
drugs
or
have
been
--
and
there
is
just
that
footnote
really
which
has
a
few
examples.
definitely
they
are
there
in
this
category.
so
would
it
be
helpful
if
you
included
in
the
excluded
part
people
who
were
high
on
drugs?
you
see,
so
we
give
you
the
high
on
drugs
people.
it's
the
drug
offense,
and
those
who
are
high
on
drugs,
and
those
--
i
mean
is
there
a
way
of
drawing
this
rule
that
we
could
catch
most
of
the
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
simplest
thing
for
any
prison
official
is
say
do
it
for
everybody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
the
fact
they
do
it
for
everybody
and
don't
try
to
make
some
exclusion
for
traffic
violators
or
something
might
be
consistent
with
little
or
no
evidence;
it
might
be
consistent
with
some.
that's
why
i
keep
looking
for
it.
