justice
sonia
sotomayor
sorry.
are
you
suggesting
--
three
different
levels.
stripping
naked:
it's
okay
to
stand
5
feet
away,
but
not
2?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
are
you
--
are
you
taking
the
position
that
it's
the
purpose
of
the
search--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
--
that's
at
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
still
unsure.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
it's
okay
to
shower--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
have
an
officer
watch
you
shower
naked--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
is
the
greater
intrusion
is
that
you
are
standing
2
as
opposed
to
5
feet
away?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
a
line
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
let's
go
to
the
next
line,
which
is
--
that's
one
kind
of
search.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
second
is
i
think
what
some
have
called
a
visual
cavity
search.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
whether
you
are
going
to
have
the
individual
open
or
expose
private
parts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
make
an
argument
that
that
is
different
than
just
a
visual
search?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
clarify
two
points
for
me?
the
first
is,
was
he
admitted
into
the
general
population
at
burlington?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
prior
charge
against
your
client
was
the
use
--
involved
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
assuming
the
prison
knew
this,
wouldn't
that
provide
the
reasonable
suspicion
that
you
argue
was
missing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
you
are
--
you
are
feeding
into
your
adversary's
argument
that
what
you
are
asking
the
police
to
do
on
intake,
or
the
corrections
facility
on
intake,
is
to
investigate
in
that
fine
detail?
they
can't
even
look
at
the
rap
sheet--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
see
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
and
say,
ah,
this
guy
could
be
dangerous?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
do
we
change
the
policy?
in
bell
we
found
that
the
policy
was
successful.
even
though
there
were
searches,
contraband
still
got
in.
so
virtually
every
circuit
in
practice
in
the
federal
system
have
been
following
this
reasonable
suspicion
for
minor
crimes
and
they
have
been
fairly
successful.
so
why
do
we
change
the
constitutional
rule
to
let
them
do
more?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
invade
more.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understand
contraband
is
serious.
but
most
of
the
studies
point
to
it
not
being
on
intake,
but
coming
in
through
guards,
coming
in
through
contact
visits.
the
great
cause
today
is
that
from
corrupt
correction
officials.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
i
ask
you
something
just
in
terms
of
your
rule.
i
think
your
brief
says
your
rule
is
you
are
not
entitled
constitutionally
to
any
right
of
privacy
in
prison.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
that's
the
case,
are
you
saying
that
if
the
prisons
decide
on
a
manual
search,
every
prisoner
who
comes
in,
correction
officers
can
manually
check
their
cavities?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
is
some
privacy
rule
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question?
isn't
one
of
the
factors
that
we
look
at
under
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness?
and
should
we
be
thinking
about
the
fact
that
many
of
these
people
who
are
now
being
arrested
are
being
put
into
general
populations
or
into
jails,
sometimes
not
just
overnight
but
for
longer
periods
of
time,
like
this
gentleman,
for
6
days
before
he
sees
a
magistrate?
should
we
be
considering
a
rule
that
basically
says
your
right
to
search
someone
depends
on
whether
that
individual
has
in
fact
been
arrested
for
a
crime
that's
going
to
lead
to
jail
time
or
not,
whether
that
person's
been
presented
to
a
magistrate
to
see
whether
there
is
in
fact
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
detention
of
this
individual?
i
mean,
there
is
something
unsettling
about
permitting
the
police
to
arrest
people
for
things,
like
kids
who
are
staying
out
after
curfew
with
no
other,
based
on
probably
nothing
else.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
are
we
doing
with
the
presumption
of
innocence?
that's
also
a
constitutional
right.
and
so
shouldn't
the
degree
to
which
a
search
is
permitted
be
conditioned
in
some
way
on
whether
or
not
this
person
has
been
presented
to
a
magistrate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sure.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
phillips--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
issue
has
to
be
certainly
some
misdemeanor.
some
people
charged
with
misdemeanor
crimes
will
try
to
smuggle
things
in.
the
issue
is
how
many
of
them
would
not
have
been
found
on
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
i
think
justice
breyer
said
in
the
san
francisco
study
it
appears
only
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
don't
have
20/20.
we
have
how
many
years,
15
years
since
bell
where
prisons
have
been
applying
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
and
the
most
you
could
muster
under
that
standard
is
one
example
of
a
case
where
someone
has
entered?
at
some
point
empirical
evidence
has
to
mean
something
in
terms
of
us
judging
the
question
of
reasonableness.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
have
a
question
about
that
today.
i
know
it's
bad
to
base
your
judgments
on
your
own
personal
experiences.
when
i
was
a
prosecutor,
it
took
sometimes
days
to
get
a
rap
sheet.
i
understand
that
that's
no
longer
the
case
today?
that
there
virtually
almost
always
accessible
by
computers
today?
