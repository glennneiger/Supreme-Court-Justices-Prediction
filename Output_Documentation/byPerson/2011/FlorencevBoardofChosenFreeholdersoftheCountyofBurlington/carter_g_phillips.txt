mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
--
i
actually
appreciate
the
clarification
that
your
questions
brought
to
this
case,
because
i
think
there
is
a
bit
of
confusion
that
i
would
like
to
try
to
clear
up,
although
my
--
my
colleague's
movement
in
terms
of
answering
some
of
the
questions
left
me
a
little
bit
perplexed
as
to
exactly
what
the
nature
of
their
claims
are.
the
--
the
first
question
that
it
seems
to
me
the
court
should
focus
on
is
what
policy
is
at
issue
here.
and
obviously,
since
the
class
certification
deals
with
one
set
of
issues
and
the
plaintiff's
claims
deem
with
another
set
of
issues,
i
think
you
have
to
be
careful.
i
think
you
have
to
focus
on
the
policies
that
existed
in
2005.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
he
was
in
fact
searched
under
these
circumstances.
and
the
policy
in
burlington
was
that
--
was
primarily
aimed,
frankly,
at
health
and
tattoos,
and
the
policy
at
essex
was
aimed
primarily
at
contraband
and
then
secondarily
at
tattoos
and
health.
and
the
policy
at
burlington
was
largely
a
--
you
come
into
prison,
you
give
up
your
clothes,
they
look
through
your
clothes,
you
take
a
shower,
they
examine
you
fairly
cursorily,
but
look
at
you,
and
then
give
you
prison
garb
and
move
along
your
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
--
it's
before
or
during.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
it
almost
certainly
would
have
been
about
an
arm's
length,
because
at
that
--
i
mean,
the
problem
is
if
you
ar
exchanging
clothes
with
somebody,
you
are
handing
them
clothes
to
change
into,
it
is
sort
of
hard
to
be
longer
than
arm's
length
and
actually
get
the
clothes
into
his
hand.
so
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--okay.
two
arms'
lengths.
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i'm
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
that's
actually
what
they
do
in
essex.
in
essex,
they
do
it
that
way.
the
difference
between
essex
is
that
essex
in
fact
does
have
--
part
of
the
problem
is
terminological,
all
right.
you
know,
burlington
is
basically
a
body
visual
observation,
and
the
district
court
said
that's
unconstitutional,
that
just
observing
at
all
is
unconstitutional.
to
some
extent
it
seems
to
me
my
--
my
friend
here
has
given
up
that
part
of
the
district
court's
decision,
which
clearly
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
it
reversed
that
part
ought
to
be
affirmed
on
that
ground
alone.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
although
that
--
that
was
not
the
district
court's
theory.
the
district
court
didn't
say
2
to
3
feet.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
depends
on
whose
version
of
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
have
to
remember,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
so
you
would
have
to
--
you
would
have
to
interpret
--
you
would
have
to
give
us
the
benefit
of
the
interpretation,
which
was
that
it
was
more
than
2
feet.
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
of
course,
without
regard
to
that,
because
the
court
of
appeals
said,
look,
if
you
--
if
you
apply
this
court's
decision
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
it
doesn't
matter,
because
you
can
engage
in
a
much
more
intrusive
true
body
cavity
search,
which
frankly
is
more
intrusive
than
even
what
essex
county
does
in
this
case,
because
he
wasn't
asked
to
bend
over
and
to
--
and
to
have
a
body
cavity
anal
search.
what
he
was
asked
to
do
was
to
squat
and
cough,
in
the
event
that
--
because
ordinarily
that
will
cause
the
contraband
then
to
fall
out,
and
you
can
--
and
you
can
catch
it
under
those
circumstances.
so
this
is
--
that's
--
that's
sort
of
the
context
in
which
this
issue
comes
up.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
that's
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
say
from
my
perspective,
i
think
even
--
even
if
they
weren't
going
to
be
admitted
into
the
general
prison
population,
because
the
risks
remain
too
substantial.
but
the
truth
is,
i
don't
have
to
defend
that
argument,
because
both
--
both
of
these
jails
admit
their
inmates
into
the
--
into
the
general
population
99.9
percent
of
the
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
that's
not
a
line
we
draw.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
alito.
i
think
the
basic
principle
we
are
asking
for
is
that
deference
to
the
jails
and
--
and
to
the
administrators
of
the
jails
requires
that
this
court
respect
their
judgment
that
you
can't
make
a
distinction
based
on
that
specific
individual;
that
whether
somebody
is
a
minor
offender
or
a
major
offender,
one,
is
never
all
that
clear
in
the
first
place;
and
two,
isn't
a
basis
on
which
to
distinguish
the
risks
that
it
poses
to
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
--
if
you
look
at
the
expert
testimony
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
both
the
expert
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
expert
testimony
of
the
defendant
--
this
is
at
348a
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
says
"a
greater
presence
of
contraband
amongst
those
individuals
that
have
minor
offenses.
"
that's
his
--
that's
their
expert's
characterization,
that
minor
offenders
bring
in
more
contraband
than
major
offenders.
our
experts
said
misdemeanants
can
be
more
dangerous
and
more
likely
to
bring
in
contraband.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
you
can
go
back
to
bell
v.
wolfish,
where
this
court
said
that
the
fact
that
there
is
not
a
lot
of
contraband
being
found
may
be
a
testament
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
deterrent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
first
of
all
anybody
who
thinks
that
the
problems
of
contraband
are
less
serious
today
than
they
were
in
1978
is
--
is
ignoring
reality.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
can
debate
that.
but,
justice
sotomayor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fundamental
principle
that
ought
to
undergird
the
entirety
of
the
court's
analysis
here
comes
out
of
turner
v.
safley
and
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
sotomayor.
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
can
be
clear
about
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
hudson
v.
palmer
and
the
--
and
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
clearly
suggest
that
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
of
being
viewed
naked
in
a
prison.
and
therefore,
the
ordinary
burlington
approach
of
having
somebody
take
a
shower
and
looking
at
him
or
her
naked
for
tattoos
and
health
and
incidental
contraband,
clearly
constitutional,
clearly
doesn't
even
raise
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
when
you
get
beyond
that
point
and
start
to
begin
the
--
what
essex
does,
which
is
not
a
true
anal
cavity
search,
but
simply
an
anal
focus
and
genital
focus
search,
i
think
that
is
subject
to
the
turner
v.
safley
and-or
the
bell
v.
wolfish
standard.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
what
is
disturbing
about
this
case
is
in
fact
that
he
was
arrested
under
circumstances
in
which
he
candidly
shouldn't
have
been
arrested
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
understand
that.
but
i
think
to
change
the
constitutional
rule
and
to
change
the
turner
v.
safley
and
bell
v.
wolfish
standards
and
ignore
what
the
underlying
inquiry
should
be
here,
which
is
these
policies
which
apply
across
the
board
impinge
constitutional
protections,
but
nevertheless
represent
the
good
faith
judgment
of
our
jailers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
you
ask
me
the
way
i
would
analyze
it,
i
would
--
if
you
want
to
adopt
a
different
set
of
standards
about
who
ought
to
be
arrested
and
who
ought
to
be
taken
to
jail,
that's
fine.
i
understand
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i
think
once
you
are
talking
about
actually
bringing
someone
into
the
jail
to
be
admitted
into
the
general
population
and
what
is
without
question
one
of
the
most
dangerous,
most
risky
environments,
in
that
context
i
would
hope
that
this
court,
rather
than
asking
individual
jailers
to
make
decisions
on
the
basis
of
--
where
they
clearly
will
not
have
the
kind
of
information
you
are
asking
them
to
make
and
where
if
they
make
a
judgment
wrong
in
either
direction
all
it
means
is
litigation.
either
they--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
what
we
do
with
a
true
anal
body
cavity
search.
what
we
--
i
mean,
we
changed
the
policy
to
be
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
changed
the
policy
because
of
litigation
concerns.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
liability
concerns.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
--
well,
you
can
characterize
it
that
way.
but
i
think
the
better
way
to
think
about
it
is
that
what
essex
wants,
what
essex
policy
permitted
it
to
do,
was
to
examine
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
see,
that's
the
problem,
is
that
the
language
there
is
different.
because
the
--
the
truth
is
that
the
line
that
the
new
policy
draws
is
between
a
true
--
what
i
--
what
i
think
bell
v.
wolfish
was
describing,
where
you
ask
the
inmate
to
bend
over
and
expose
his
or
her
anus
for
a
cavity
search.
on
that
score,
that's
what
--
we
don't
do
that.
but
we
do,
in
fact,
ask--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
what
we
do
is
ask
the
individual
to
lift
his
genitals
and
to
squat
and
cough.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
slightly
more
than
a
simple--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
i
don't
think
that
is
the
line
to
draw.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
we
are
still
liable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
question
clearly
remains
in
the
case.
i'm
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
and
all
i'm
--
all
i
--
the
only
point
i
have
been
trying
to
make
here
is
that
if
you
--
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
district
court
analyzed
the
case,
the
district
court
split
it
up,
and
it's
the
basis
of
the
class
distinction
versus
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
kennedy,
there
actually
is
testimony
in
the
record
from
the
warden
saying
that
in
order
to
ensure
everybody's
safety,
we
are
better
off
with
a
blanket
policy
that
says
we
are
going
to
engage
in
--
in
some
form
of
a
search
--
essex
has
a
slightly
more
intrusive
one
--
but
it's
all
designed
to
accomplish
the
same
thing.
it's
not
just
designed
to
ensure
against
contraband
and
--
and
that
--
it's
designed
to
ensure
that
there
isn't
somebody
like
mr.
florence
who
is
going
to
end
up
being
poked
or
otherwise--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
is
the
testimony
in
the
record
from
their
expert,
who
said
that
in
kentucky,
there
is
today
--
the
single
biggest
problem
in
kentucky
prisons
and
the
biggest
cause
of
death
is
drug
overdose,
which
suggests
that
there
is
a
serious
contraband
issue
in
kentucky.
kentucky
is
in
one
of
those
--
is
one
of
those
--
is
inside
one
of
the
circuits
that
has
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
as
a
constitutional
matter
forever.
so
i
would
say
there
yes,
there
is
some
evidence
from
which
you
could
infer
that
it's
worse
now
than
it
was.
but
i
would
also
ask
the
court
to
rely
on
its
common
sense
and
it
its
own
--
what
is
essentially
took
judicial
notice
of
in
bell
v.
wolfish
and
rutherford
v.
black,
which
is
this
is
a
serious
problem,
and
it
is
no
less
a
serious
problem
today
than
it
was
more
than
30
years
ago,
when
this
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
--
i
don't
believe
that
--
my
position
would
be
no,
there
isn't
a
constitutional
impediment,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
balance
would
tip
in
favor
of
the
--
of
the
institution
under
those
circumstances.
i
do
think
--
obviously,
there
is
a
limit
between
a
manual
physical
body
cavity
search,
and
that
it
seems
to
me,
yes,
i
think
--
that
would
--
that
would
be
a
very
different
balance
of
the
equation,
and
i
--
i
suspect
i
would
be
very
hard
pressed
to
just
--
to
convince
five
members
of
this
court
that
that's
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
you
may
want
to
write
it
slightly
differently.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but
what
--
but
what
i
would
really
like
is
an
opinion
that
recognizes
that
deference
to
the
prison
and
to
their
judgment
is
what's
appropriate
under
these
circumstances,
and
that
extends
all
the
way
to
the
bell
v.
wolfish
line.
the
only
difference
being
that
i
would
like
for
the
court
to
analyze
it
under
turner
v.
safley,
in
which
--
in
which
the
analysis
is,
is
there
--
you
know,
is
there
a
logical
nexus
between
the
rule
that
the
--
that
the
prisons
have
in
preventing
a
problem,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
and
are
there
reasonable
alternatives.
and
there,
the
answer
is
no.
if
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--all
--
clearly,
all
of
our
searches
are
permissible,
and
i
would
go--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
bell
v.
wolfish.
yes.
i
think
that's
exactly
the
holding
of
bell
v.
wolfish.
bell
v.
wolfish
was
not
tied
in
its
opinion
itself
to
the
fact
that
they--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
correct.
we
don't
know.
and
of
course,
part
of
--
part
of
the
empirical
problem
in
--
in
that
is
that
that
facility
had
only
been
opened
for
four
months
anyway.
so
it
was
really
going
to
be
difficult,
if
you
were
going
to
adopt
the
policy
they
had
adopted
in
bell,
to
insist
on
some
sort
of
empirical
proof--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
but
the
policy
itself
--
may
i
answer
the
question?
the
policy
is
aimed
at
all
people,
not
just
mr.
florence,
and
if
you
aim
it
at
all
people,
there
are
people
who
self-report
who
obviously
have
got
an
opportunity
to
bring
in
contraband,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
just
get
arrested
and
happen
to
have
drugs
or
something
on
them,
and
rather
than
show
those
when
they
are
being
stopped
for
a
speeding
ticket,
will
likely
stick
it
in
their
pocket
or
put
it
somewhere
else.
thank
you,
your
honor.
