justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
apply
the
reasonable
suspicion
rule
to
all
arrestees?
i
thought
you
were
making
a
distinction
between
felons
and
less
serious
offenders.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
do
--
to
do
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
just
said
stripped
naked
is
different
from
a
different
strip
search.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
is
permitted?
there
are
various
things.
what,
is
showering
in
the
presence
of
officers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
--
they
can
be
inspected
without
their
clothes?
just
it's
more
than
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
want
to
know
what
is
permitted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one,
not
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
less
intrusive
than
the
one,
than
the
search
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
which
involved
pretrial
detainees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
if
the
pretrial
detainees
in
bell
were
also
inspected
on
entry
into
the
facility?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
trying
to
state
the
constitutional
rule,
and
you
keep
talking
about
what
is
their
rule,
and
we
are
trying
to
find
out
what
are
the
limits--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
the
rule,
and
i
think
you've
already
qualified
what
you
said
opening.
opening,
you
said
reasonable
suspicion
is
the
rule
for
everyone,
the
felon
as
well
as
the
minor
offenders.
now
you
seem
to
be
saying,
well,
this
case
involves
only
minor
offenders,
so
let's
limit
it
to
that.
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
saying
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--dividing
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--made
i
just
ask,
on
your
medical
personnel,
children
in
school
get
inspected
for
--
for
head
lice,
prisoners
for
body
lice.
you
don't
need
a
doctor
to
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
constitutionally
required.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
another
thing
that
--
that
you
don't
need
to
--
to
--
they
can
inspect
for
body
lice,
and
that's
--
that's
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
government
tells
us
that
that's
true
only
if
they
don't
put
the
arrestee
in
the
general
population.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
any
--
are
there
any
constitutional
limits,
in
your
view?
you
say
you
didn't
attempt
the
kind
of
search
that
was
done
in
bell
v.
wolfish.
is
there
any
constitutional
impediment
to
your
doing
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there's
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
are
saying
that
they
can
do
the
full
--
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
all
of
these
searches
are
permissible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
bell
v.
wolfish--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they
did
--
they
didn't
stress
--
they
didn't
stress
that
there
was
a
visitor
who
could
--
who
could
give
the
inmate
contraband.
bell
v.
wolfish
doesn't
--
and
i
asked
mr.
goldstein
whether
we
know
whether
the
pretrial
detainees
in
new
york
were
searched
that
way
on
entry,
and
he
said
there
is
nothing
that
shows
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
do
you
get--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
not
the
federal
rules,
and
by
the
way,
the
brief
was
really
confusing.
when
what
--
when
i
read
page
1,
page
1
tells
me
that
the
bop
policy
requires
all
incoming
pretrial
detainees
to
be
subject
to
visual
body
cavity
inspections.
and
then
it
isn't
until
page
30
that
i
learn
that
there
is
an
exception,
for
the
very
category
of
arrestee
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
that
they
are
not
subject
to
body
cavity
inspections
unless
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
are
carrying
contraband.
that
the
misdemeanor
or
civil
contempt
offender
is
not
subject.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i
want
to
know
how
people
in
this
category
are
treated
in
the
federal
system.
as
you
--
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
reversed
it.
they
--
those
people
are
not
subject
to
this
visual
body
cavity
search.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
is
so
much
sense
to
the
policy,
why
isn't
the
federal
policy?
before
you
said
because
there
aren't
that
many
offenders.
if
there
were
more,
then
would
there
be
--
would
the
federal
policy
change
so
that
even
people
who
are
in
on
a
contempt
charge
or
a
minor
crime--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
you
think
the
feds
think
it's
a
good
policy
to
inspect
everyone?
