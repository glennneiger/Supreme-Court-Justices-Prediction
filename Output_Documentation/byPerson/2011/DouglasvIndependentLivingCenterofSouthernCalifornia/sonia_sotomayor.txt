justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
were
those
--
were
those
amendments
submitted
before
they
took
effect
or
after
they
had
taken
affect,
like
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
where
i'm
a
little
bit
confused.
the
injunction
here
only
stopped
you
from
implementing
the
rate
changes
until
you
got
approval
from
hhs
in
its
administrative
process
that
it
was
going
to
approve
the
amendment,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
separate
question
about
whether
the
courts
are
required
to
give
deference
to
an
hhs
finding.
but
the
injunction
here
wasn't
one
that
said
you
could
never
do
this.
it
just
said
go
finish
the
process,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
it's
not,
could
you
please
--
you
said
yes,
it
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
give
me
the
theoretical
foundation?
the
supremacy
clause
doesn't,
i
am
assuming
you
agree
with
your
--
with
petitioner
that
it
doesn't
provide
for
a
cause
of
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
what
gets
all
of
the
cases
that
we've
had
since
1824
into
this
court
that
have
granted
injunctive
relief
on
supremacy
arguments?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
we
have
plenty
that
don't
--
king,
townsend,
carlson.
we
have
had
many
others
that
are
not
dissimilar
to
this
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
go
back
and
explain
to
me
how
all
of
those
cases,
what's
the
theoretical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
go
to
your
petitioner's
response
to
one
of
my
colleague's
--
to
justice
scalia,
when
she
said
yes,
if
these
providers
decide
to
charge
the
old
rate
to
their
patients,
the
state
will
go
after
them.
how
is
that
any
different
than
the
cases
where
we
are
talking
about
railroads
charging
--
not
charging
customers
more
than
a
state
commands
because
the
penalty's
too
high,
or
those
types
of
cases
that
fall
into
this
preemptive
category
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
haven't
explained
how
that's
theoretically
different
than
the
example
i
just
gave
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
ask
--
why
are
you
fighting
justice
breyer
so
much?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
sounds
like
you
are
and
that's
why
i
am
having
some
difficulty.
there
are
two
points.
following
up
on
his
and
then
my
second
question.
engage
the
solicitor
general's
question
that
this
isn't
a
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause,
but
that
it
is
a
cause
of
action
under
some
implied
equitable--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--doctrine,
okay?
which
may
square
enough
now.
coming
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
i
agree
with
all
you
were
trying
to
say
about
what
the
state
did
or
didn't
do
here,
but
if
it's
a
primary
jurisdiction
question,
what's
wrong
with
just
saying
that
the
court's
power
is
limited
under
equity
to
issuing
an
injunction
that
gives
the
matter
over
to
the
administrative
agency
that
puts
in
the
status
quo
--
assuming
there
is
some
sort
of
violation
of
federal
law
or
seeming
violation
of
federal
law
--
a
preventive
injunction
that
just
stops
the
state
from
acting
until
the
administrative
process
concludes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no;
they
are
saying
you
can't
have
any.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
justice
breyer's
question
i
think
was
slightly
different,
which
is,
what's
the
limit
on
the
court's
power?
and
how
do
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
you
engaged
the
question
that
--
the
approach
that
the
solicitor
general
has
been
making,
which
is
don't
find
a
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause;
find
it
in
the
court's
--
an
implied
cause
of
action.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
might,
if
you
continue
in
your
earlier
position
that
a
supremacy
clause
cause
of
action
would
stop
congress
from
having
a
--
a
voice
in
enforcement
and
cutting
it
off
clearly.
if
congress
were
to
write
a
law
that
says
no
one
can
enforce
this,
either
in
damages
or
in
injunctive
relief,
your
earlier
answer
seemed
to
suggest
that
congress
didn't
have
the
power
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
do
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
this
were
an
equitable--
