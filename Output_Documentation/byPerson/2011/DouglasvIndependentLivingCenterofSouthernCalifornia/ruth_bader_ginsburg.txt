justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
schwartz,
the
government
doesn't
have
the
injunctive
power.
as
far
as
california's
rates
are
concerned,
california
puts
them
into
effect.
the
government
can't
stop
that
from
happening,
even
if
the
government
thinks
that
they
are
in
violation
of
the
medicaid
act;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that's
a
very
drastic
remedy
that's
going
to
hurt
the
people
that
medicaid
was
meant
to
benefit.
does
the
government
have
any
injunctive
power,
or
is
its
only
--
only
remedy
a
fund
cutoff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
often
has
it
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
--
how
often
has
in
the
medicaid
context--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
what
about
the
providers
who
say,
but
under
--
under
the
state
law,
if
we
charge
more
than
the
hospitals
--
if
we
charge
more
than
the
state
ceiling,
we
are
subject
to
sanctions,
so
this
does
fit
into
the
category
of
anticipatory
defenses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
they
be
--
the
rates
go
into
effect.
someone
charges
more
on
the
theory
that
the
rates
are
impermissible
under
the
supremacy
clause.
that
person
would
be
subject
to
sanction
under
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
mr.
kneedler,
before
you
sit
down,
could
you
please
enlighten
us
on
two
fact
points.
one
is,
what
is
the
status
of
the
30(a)
rulemaking?
i
take
it
once
the
rule
is
made,
it
would
get
chevron
deference.
you
said
that
there
would
be
a
final
rule
in
december.
is
that
still--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
the
status
of
the
hearing
on
california's
compliance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
saying
then,
if
congress
loud
and
clear
says,
we
want
hhs
to
be
the
sole
enforcer
of
this
law,
you're
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
are
saying
that
that
would
be
ineffective
because
there
could
still
be
a
supremacy
clause
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
on
the
merits,
but
congress
says
we
don't
want
anybody
coming
into
the
court.
we
want--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
it's
a
question
of
what
would
be
the
default
rule.
congress
is
silent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
default
rule
that
there
is
a
supremacy
clause
action
or
that
congress
must
expressly
allow
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
you
would
be
satisfied
with
a
limitation
that
the
court
can
issue
an
injunction
pending
the
administrative
procedure
without
going
on
to
then
the
substance
of
the
question,
was
there
compliance
with
30(a)
by
california?
