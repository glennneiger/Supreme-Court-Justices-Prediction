justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rule
that
is
good
for
this
one
case
only?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
gave
--
or
is
there
--
could
you
state
the
rule
in
broader
terms
or
more
neutral
terms?
and
you
gave
three
reasons
why
we
should
reverse.
one,
congress
hasn't
created
a
cause
of
action
here.
well,
congress
has
never
created
causes
of
action,
never
creates
a
cause
of
action
in
any
case
in
the
ex
parte
young
line
or
cases
like
that.
the
supremacy
clause,
because
this
is
a
spending
clause,
this
was
an
act
under
the
spending
clause.
but
you
are
not
asking
us
to
hold
that
a
spending
clause
legislation
can
never
preempt
state
legislation,
i
take
it.
and
then
the
language
of
30(a),
where
you
--
are
you
arguing
that
30
--
that
the
medicaid
act
affirmatively
precludes
any
action
like
this.
i
don't
understand
that.
is
--
is
any
of
those
arguments
sufficient
by
itself,
or
do
you
have
to
take
them
all
together,
and
you
are
asking
for
a
rule
that
only
applies
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
the
plaintiffs
here
were
facing
an
imminent
state
enforcement
action.
would
your
argument
be
different?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
how
does
that
square
with
the
argument
that
you
made
relying
on
separation
of
powers,
spending
clause
and
the
language
of
30(a)?
all
of
those
are
still
in
play--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
that
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
that
the
equitable
power
exercised
in
ex
parte
young
and
similar
cases
is
limited
to
certain
specific
situations
such
as
where
there
is
an
imminent
threat
of
the
state
enforcement
action,
and
a
few
others
where
there
is
a
trespass,
where
there's
a
clearly
defined
federal
right.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
encompass
every
situation
in
which
the
plaintiff
simply
has
article
iii
standing
and
wants
to
obtain
an
injunction
that
a
particular
state
law
is
preempted
by
a
federal
law.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
happens
when
the
agency
approves
rates
and
someone
is
dissatisfied
with
the
rate
sues
and
says
these
rates
are
ridiculously
low?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
can
still
bring
a
suit--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
how
do
you
know
they're
going
to
lose
the
litigation?
why
should
they
lose
the
litigation
if
it's
really
--
if
there
really
is
a
cause
of
action
there?
some
of
the
medicaid
rates
are
very
low,
aren't
they?
