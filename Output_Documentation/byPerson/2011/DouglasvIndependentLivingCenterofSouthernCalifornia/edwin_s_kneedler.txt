mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
medicaid
is
a
cooperative
program
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
congress
has
not
created
a
cause
of
action
under
that
act
for
private
parties
to
enforce
particular
provisions
of
it.
nor
does
paragraph
30(a)
confer
private
rights
that
are
enforceable
under
1983.
rather
paragraph
30(a)
is
written
in
general
terms
that
describe
the
general
undertaking
by
the
state
in
its
bilateral
relationship
with
the
federal
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
the
great
majority
of
those
cases
are
ones
in
which
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit
in
equity
is
bringing
an
action
anticipating
an
action
at
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
though
that
they
do
not
reflect
a
general
assumption
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
supremacy
clause,
because
as
this
court
said,
the
supremacy
clause
is
not
itself
a
source
of
rights--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
there
is
--
i
think
one
has
to
look
to
an
equitable
cause
of
action,
which
i
think
is
the
way
ex
parte
young
describes
what
is
going
on
in
that
way
is
anticipating
a
defense,
and
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
has
not
been
plaintiff's
theory
of
this
case.
they
have
not
said
we
are
going
to
resort
to
self-help
and
charge
more
than
the
state
allows.
what
they
want
to
do
is
they
brought
this
suit
to
challenge
the
rates
in
the
first
instance.
they
are
not
claiming
that
they
are
going
to
violate
state
law
and
charge
more;
they
are
simply
wanting
to
challenge
the
rates
that
the
state
is
charging,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i
think
it
is,
and
if
i
could
explain--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
not
sure.
there
would
be
further
questions
that
would
arise
in
that
context.
for
example,
i
don't
know
whether
--
whether
--
whether
in
a
prosecution
under
the
statute
for
charging
--
that
prohibits
charging
more
than
state
regs
allow,
whether
you
can
raise
as
a
defense
in
that
prosecution
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
rates.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
why
i'm
saying
there
might
be
a
further
question
in
--
in
what
you're
describing
as
to
whether
that
would
be
a
valid
defense
in
the
state
prosecution,
because
i
could
certainly
imagine
the
state
saying,
we
don't
want
our
rates
tested
in
individual
criminal
prosecutions
any
more
than
we
would
want
them
tested
in
an
affirmative--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
unexamined.
and
let
me
say,
we
are
not
challenging
those
cases.
and
the
court,
we
think,
doesn't
need
to
look
more
broadly
to
a
theory
--
to
an
all-encompassing
theory.
we
are
focusing
on
spending
clause
legislation
in
a
particular
cooperative
federal/state--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
the
spending
clause.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
probably
the
best
way
to
explain
it
is
equitable
cause
of
action
drawing
on
the
court's
traditional
equitable
jurisdiction;
you
can
call
that
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause,
but
i
think
historically,
it's
been
described
as
an--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--exercise
of
the
court's
equitable
authority.
the
court
has
equitable
discretion,
and
we
think
because
of
the
spending
clause
nature
of
this
legislation,
it
should
not
create
the
cause
of
action--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right
--
we
are
focusing
on--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
are
certainly
not
challenging
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
in
equity.
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
just
--
i
think
we
would
view
it
as
a
cause
of
action
in
equity
rather
than
implied
under
the
supremacy
clause,
but
i
think
you
may
--
you
might
get
to
the
same
place,
but
i
think
it's
judicial
creation
of
a
cause
of
action.
but
if
i
could
before
my
time
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
categorical
rule
because,
for
example,
under
spending
clause
cases,
you
can
have
rights
enforceable
under
1983.
our
basic
point
is,
a
spending
clause
is
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state,
and
the
respondents
here
are
in
the
position
of
the
people
asserting
rights
as
third-party
beneficiaries
to
the
bilateral
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
states.
under
standard
contract
law
principles--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
third-party
can
sue
only
if
the
parties
intending
them
to
be.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
the
circumstances
in
which
the
court
has
made
that
point
and
we
agree
with
are
often
in
situations
where
you
have
title
6,
title
9
instances
of
individual
discrimination
that
are
arising
under
federal
programs,
or
where
you
have
a
right
under
1983
where
--
whether
as
an
enforceable
right
that
a
party
has
and
is
going
into
court
and
is
supplementing
the
agency's
oversight.
here,
under
paragraph
30(a),
you
have
only
general
standards
that
are
really
suitable
for
administrative
review,
balancing
general--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
just
a
merits
question,
i
think
it
also
goes
to
the
question
whether
the
parties
to
the
contract
intended
third-party
beneficiary-type
rights
to
be
able
to
sue
under
what
is
really
analogous
to
a
contract.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
court's
decision
in
maine
v.
thibotout
first
recognized
a
1983
cause
of
action,
pointed
to
prior
cases
enforcing
social
security
programs,
on
the
assumption
that
1983
could
have
been
the
only
source
of
the
cause
of
action.
if
there
was
an
implied
judge-made
cause
of
action
in
those
circumstances,
that
assumption
would
have
been
unwarranted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
am
informed
that
it
may
slip
past
december,
that
there's
been
a
lot
of
interaction
with
comments
on
it.
i
don't
know
a
precise
date,
but
i'm
informed
that
that
may
be
possible.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
still
pending.
there
have
been
extensions
that
have
also
been
planned
amendments
that
have
been
submitted
covering
some
of
these
same
regs,
justice
ginsburg
i
also
wanted
to
respond
to
one
of
your
questions
i
do
believe
that
the
united
states
would
have
injunctive
actions
under
certain
cases,
for
example,
if
the
state
itself
accepted
a
plan
and
the
state
continued
to
follow
the
terms
of
the
disapproved
final
amendment,
i
think
the
united
states
would
have
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
as
the
party
to
the
contract.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no
it
would
be
enforcing
the
terms
of
its
agreement
with
the
united
states.
it
can't
rely
on
preemption
in
those
--
those
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think
it's
a
harder
question,
but
probably
so,
because
we
believe
paragraph
38
does
not
confer
private
rights
and
that
would
be
true
in
the
state
court
as
well
as
the
federal
court.
