justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
am
not
certain,
as
i
find
this
a
difficult
case.
it
seems
to
me
the
government
is
prepared
to
concede
that
if
an
individual
has
a
federal
right
that
he
would
like
to
enforce
and
someone
is
trying
to
block
it
by
asserting
a
state
law
that
he
thinks
is
preempted,
he
can
go
ahead.
if
it
looks
as
if
the
state
is
going
to
take
something
from
him
that
a
federal
law
guarantees
and
he
has
a
defense
that
he
would
like
to
make
to
that
under
federal
law,
the
state
law
seems
to
allow,
it
is
preempted,
he
can
make
it.
our
problem
arising
where
neither
of
those
things
is
true.
so
we
say,
what
is
true
here?
what
kind
of
federal
claim
does
he
have?
and
the
word
is
that
rates
have
to
be
--
that
the
rate
that
the
state
has
to
pay
back
to
the
doctor
has
to
be
"sufficient".
okay,
"sufficient".
that's
basically
the
word.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
see
three
possibilities.
one
is
you
say,
sure,
let
all
the
doctors
go
and
sue.
there
are
only
50,000
kinds
of
reimbursement.
maybe
there
are
a
million.
i
don't
know
how
many.
and
they
only
take
place
in
like,
say,
400,000
counties.
and
we
will
have
federal
judges
reaching
different
views
about
what
is
sufficient
in
each
of
those
different
places.
and
sometimes
they
will
agree.
did
congress
want
that?
well,
hm,
a
problem.
the
second
way
of
going
about
it
is
cure
that
and
say
you
win,
but
you
have
to
use
primary
jurisdiction
and
you
have
to
get
the
government's
view
on
it,
judge;
and
before
you
decide,
you
have
to
pay
attention.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
--
i
have
one
more
thing
and
then
you'll
get
all
three.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
want
your
view,
i
want
your
view
on
whether
the
right
approach
--
you
are
saying
what
is
the
status
quo
pending.
and
i
want
your
view
on
these
three
possibilities:
one
is
the
possibility
the
judges
just
do
it
in
all
the
different
places,
try
to
figure
out
what
is
sufficient.
the
second
is
the
possibility
that
we
try
primary
jurisdiction,
and
that's
the
--
then
the
curlicue
on
that
is
what
do
you
do
pending.
and
that's
your
injunction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
the
third
possibility
is,
you
say
i'm
just
sorry,
that
this
is
just
too
vague,
the
sufficient,
et
cetera.
it
has
to
be
centralized.
there
is
no
way
to
work
this
out
with
all
these
different
judges
and
different
rates
and
different
kinds
of
provisions,
and
so
this
is
an
instance
where
you
cannot
bring
your
claim
that
something
violates
the
supremacy
clause
because
you
don't
have
a
federal
right
to
a
thing,
and
you
are
not
trying
to
take
away
a
thing
that
the
federal
right
gives
you,
et
cetera.
do
you
see
those
three
possibilities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i
wanted
you
to
do
is
address
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
primary
jurisdiction
is
the
way
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
a
practical
problem
and
the
practical
problem
is
millions
of
rates
all
judged
by
the
term
"sufficient"
and
instead
of
the
agency
in
charge
deciding
what's
sufficient,
we
do
have
a
lot
of
judges.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
must
be
a
limit.
there
must
be
a
limit
because
if
there
is
not
a
limit
under
what
you
can
do
under
ex
parte
young,
i
can
go
in
my
office
and
i
look
at
the
statute
books
and
they
are
just
filled
with
statutes,
and
i
--
federal;
and
if
i
have
all
the
state
statute
books
there
would
be
15
offices
or
20
or
100;
and
i
know
perfectly
well
that
a
lot
of
those
statutes
in
the
federal
books
have
to
do
with
federal
agencies,
and
they
give
jobs
to
agencies,
and
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
the
ones
who
run
those
statutes
in
many
instances
are
the
agencies,
and
really
judges
are
out
of
it.
now
if
i
adopt
your
line,
it
seems
to
me
i
am
saying
that
any
time
that
a
person
has
an
individual
of
saying
that
a
state
law
is
contrary
to
one
of
those
statutes,
he
can
run
right
into
court.
and
i
can
see
we've
done
that
where
he
has
some
kind
of
right
that
he
is
protecting
that
is
threatened
in
some
way
or
that
he
wants
to
assert.
i
can
see
that
we
could
do
that
in
the
foreign
policy
case
like
burma;
i
see
that
we
could
do
that
where
federal
voting
rights
are
at
stake,
which
are
very
important.
but
a
principle
that
says
you
can
do
that
any
time
you
want,
seems
to
me
a
little
--
it
seems
to
me
the
real
fear
of
far
reaching,
in
the
extent
that
it
just
stops
the
agency
of
doing
their
business
at
the
behest
of
anyone
who
would
like
to
assert
a
state
law,
or
states
--
it's
a
mess,
in
other
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
your
people
have
your
problem.
but
some
other
people
have
another
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
doctors
want
to
be
paid
more
money
or
at
least
not
paid
as
much
as
they
were,
i
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
there
a
medical
exception?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
medical
exception?
is
it
that
you
can
have
this
generalized
claim
if
you
are
a
doctor,
but
not
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difficult
thing
is
to
explain
what
this
case
is
about.
it's
about
medicaid
and
medicaid
is
a
cooperative
federal
state
program
that
provides
medical
care
for
needy
individuals.
to
qualify,
a
state
has
to
have
its
medicaid
statutes
approved
by
a
federal
agency,
the
one
that
administers
the
program,
it's
called
the
centers
for
medicare
and
medicaid
services
or
initials
are
cms,
which
reviews
the
statutes,
the
states
statutes
to
determine
if
they
comply
with
the
federal
law.
the
federal
law
that's
involved
here
is
a
federal
law
that
says
states
statutes
have
to
"assure
that
payments
to
the
ultimate
--
to
the
medicaid
providers
like
doctors
are
consistent
with
the
efficiency,
economy
and
quality
of
care
and
are
sufficient
to
enlist
enough
providers
to
make
medicaid
care
and
services
available.
so
you
have
to
pay
the
providers
enough
money
so
that
--
now,
few
years
ago,
california
enacted
three
statutes
reducing
its
payments
to
various
of
the
medicaid
providers.
the
state
submitted
them
to
the
federal
agency
for
approval,
but
before
the
agency
finished
reviewing
them,
certain
groups
of
medicaid
providers
and
beneficiaries
filed
a
series
of
lawsuits,
seeking
to
enjoin
the
state
statutes
on
the
ground
that
they
didn't
--
they
conflicted
with
the
statute
i
just
read
and
that
they
were
so
preempted
by
federal
medicaid
law.
in
other
words,
that
heart
of
it,
as
they
were
saying
the
payments
that
california
now
wanted
to
make
weren't
sufficient
to
enlist
enough
providers
like
the
doctors.
the
providers
and
beneficiaries
brought
their
suits
based
directly
on
the
constitution's
supremacy
clause
which
says
that
federal
law
takes
precedence
over
state
law.
they
were
saying
these
california
state
laws
weren't
good
enough
to
comply
with
the
federal
law
which
says
you
have
to
pay
them
enough
money.
california
in
response
argued
that
the
providers
and
beneficiaries
don't
have
the
right
to
bring
a
suit
like
this.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
supremacy
clause
action
in
this
situation
to
enforce
this
federal
law,
but
the
lower
court
decisions
that
we
were
reviewing
said,
yes,
they
can.
they
can
bring
this
action
addressed
--
based
right
on
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
other
courts
like
the
ninth
circuit
and
certain
federal
courts
said,
the
state
statutes
are
invalid,
they
do
conflict.
and
in
the
meantime,
the
agency
officials,
proceeding
on
a
separate
agency
reviewing
track,
were
reviewing
the
same
statutes
to
make
up
their
mind
whether
they
could
--
they've
conflicted.
california
initially
lost
in
the
agency,
but
then
it
sought
further
administrative
tract
review
in
the
agency.
that's
the
posture
of
the
cases
wherein
when
we
decided
to
grant
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
providers
and
beneficiaries
could
mount
a
supremacy
clause
challenge.
i
told
it
was
complicated
just
to
figure
out
what's
going
on.
since
we
granted
certiorari,
the
relevant
circumstances
have
changed.
after
oral
argument,
the
federal
agency
reversed
course
and
it
approved
the
state
statutes.
now,
the
agency's
approval
doesn't
moot
the
case,
but
it
does
put
them
in
a
different
posture.
the
agency
that's
charged
with
administering
the
medicaid
statutes
has
now
said
that
the
state
statutes
do
comply
with
the
federal
law.
that
decision
doesn't
change
the
underlying
substantive
question,
namely,
whether
they
really
do
comply,
but
it
does
change
possibly
the
answer.
and
it
may
require
the
respondents
who
are
trying
to
attack
the
state
statutes
as
being
inconsistent
with
federal
law
that
may
require
them
to
proceed
through
a
procedure
that
seeks
review
of
the
agency
determination
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
apa,
rather
than
an
action
against
california
under
the
supremacy
clause.
and
in
our
opinion,
we
explain
why
it
might
change,
how
you
are
supposed
to
go
about
getting
the
review
of
these
state
statutes.
we
also
recognize,
however,
that
the
parties
have
not
fully
argued
the
question
in
the
cases'
new
posture.
so
given
the
complexity
of
these
cases,
which
you
may
be
convinced
about,
rather
than
ordering
re-argument
here,
we
vacate
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
and
we
remand
the
cases
thereby
permitting
the
parties
to
argue
the
matter
more
fully
before
that
circuit
in
the
first
instance.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
scalia,
thomas
and
alito
have
joined.
