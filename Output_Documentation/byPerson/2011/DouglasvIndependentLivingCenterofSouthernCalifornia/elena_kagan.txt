justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
schwartz,
isn't
it
the
exception
because
in
fact
you
end-run
--
end-ran
the
administrative
process,
that
you
put
your
regulations,
your
new
rate
schedules,
into
effect
even
before
you
submitted
them
to
hhs,
and
continued
them
in
effect
while
hhs
was
considering
them,
and
continued
them
in
effect
to
the
extent
that
you
were
allowed
to
do
so
by
injunction,
even
after
hss
disapproved
them?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
schwartz,
the
agency--
justice
elena
kagan
--can
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
justice
alito
asked
you
about
why
there's
no
cause
of
action.
you
are
asking
us
to
treat
the
supremacy
clause
differently
that
every
other
constitutional
provision.
why
should
we?
justice
elena
kagan
the
supremacy
clause
is
part
of
the
constitution--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
the
petitioners
here
--
excuse
me.
the
plaintiffs
here
essentially
said
that
the
supremacy
clause
as
part
of
the
constitution
had
been
violated
and
sought,
not
damages,
but
only
a
prospective
injunction.
and
the
question
is
why
should
the
court
do
what
the
court
has
done
many,
many,
many
times
before,
tens
and
tens
and
tens
of
times
before,
and
say,
yes,
that's
our
prerogative
and
we'll
proceed
to
the
merits.
justice
elena
kagan
in
a
--
in
a
cause
of
--
in
a
suit
that's
brought
under
a
statute
directly,
a
person
could
be
claiming
damages.
here
that
is
not
the
case.
a
person
is
only
claiming
injunctive
relief.
and
that
should
--
there
should
be
a
difference
between
those
two
in
terms
of
when
the
cause
of
action
is
available.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kneedler,
why
should
this
even
matter
so
much
whether
there
is
a
defense
available
in
a
regulation
that's
brought
against
a
person
or
not.
in
your
brief,
you
admit
that
there
are
numerous
cases
that
don't
fit
within
that
category,
where
the
--
but
where
the
state
has
acted
in
some
sense
to
change
the
behavior
of
the
person,
to
regulate
the
person,
even
if
that
person
doesn't
have
a
proceeding
in
which
to
mount
a
defense.
and
this
court
has
treated
those
cases
in
exactly
the
same
way,
haven't
they?
justice
elena
kagan
but
mr.
kneedler--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
kneedler,
this
is
what
you
said
in
your
cert
stance
brief:
you
said
"those
programs
in
which
the
drastic
measure
of
withholding
all
or
a
major
portion
of
the
federal
funding
is
the
only
available
remedy.
"
and
you
are
talking
here
about
spending
clause
programs,
obviously
--
"would
be
generally
less
effective
than
a
system
that
also
permits
awards
of
injunctive
relief
in
private
actions.
"
justice
elena
kagan
can
that
really
be
the
difference?
i
mean,
do
you
think
if
30(a)
were
written
--
were
drafted
as
a
formula,
a
rate
schedule
formula,
that
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action,
but
because
30(a)
is
more
general
in
nature,
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action?
i
mean,
surely
that's
a
question
for
the
merits
of
whether
there
is
preemption
or
not.
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
necessary
to
your
position,
mr.
phillips?
justice
elena
kagan
because
you
could
take
the
view,
right,
that
if
congress
speaks
to
cut
off
a
claim,
that's
one
thing,
and
a
very
different
thing,
than
if
congress
has
not
spoken
at
all.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
phillips,
can
i
ask
you
a
little
bit
more
about
how
this
interacts
with
the
agency
process?
now
suppose
that
california
had
done
what,
the
way
i
read
the
statute,
it
was
supposed
to
do,
which
is
to
go
to
the
agency
and
say
we
want
to
change
our
rates?
we
can't
afford
these
rates
any
more
and
we
think
these
lower
rates
would
do
just
as
well.
all
right.
and
then
the
agency
and
california
sit
down
and
discuss
the
matter.
would
this
suit
have
ever
come
into
being?
justice
elena
kagan
you
know,
they
did
not
impose
them
unilaterally.
they
go
to
the
--
to
hhs
and
they
wait
for
hhs
to
approve
what
they
want
to
do.
if
hhs
approves--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
if
hhs
approved,
maybe
somebody
does
sue.
and
then
there
is
great
deference
to
the
agency,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
and
if
hhs
doesn't
approve,
then
what's
there
to
talk
about?
there
is
no
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
so
either
way,
the
agency
wins;
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
the
--
i
was
just
saying
if
the
agency
didn't
approve,
your
clients
don't
have
anything
to
complain
about.
justice
elena
kagan
correct.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry
ms.
schwartz.
are
you
saying
--
this
is
the
way
i
understood
you
and
tell
me
if
i
am
right:
are
you
saying
that
the
test
for
determining
whether
there
is
a
1983
suit
is
the
same
as
the
test
for
determining
whether
there
is
an
ex
parte
young
action?
because
you
talked
about
whether
somebody
has
a
right,
which
is
usually
the
language
we
use
in
the
1983
context.
