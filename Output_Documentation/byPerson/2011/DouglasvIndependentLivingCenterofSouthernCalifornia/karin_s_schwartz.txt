ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
many
reasons
why
this
court
should
not
recognize
a
private
cause
of
action
to
enforce
30(a)
and
i
would
like
to
focus
on
three.
first,
the
separation
of
powers.
congress
controls
who
can
enforce
federal
law,
and
it
has
not
provided
for
--
for
private
enforcement
of
30(a).
instead
it
has
provided
for
administrative
enforcement.
second
is
the
spending
clause
context
in
which
the
case
arises.
the
very
legitimacy
of
spending
clause
legislation
depends
on
the
state's
voluntary
and
knowing
acceptance
of
its
obligations.
for
this
reason,
if
congress
wants
to
provide
for
private
party
litigation,
it
must
do
so
clear
and
unambiguously,
and
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
case.
and
third
is
the
language
of
30(a)
itself,
which
is
broad
and
undefined
and
which
includes
competing
policy
interests.
these
are
suited
to
administrative
enforcement,
with
all
the
expertise
and
judgment
and
discretion
and
administrative
know-how
that
can
be
brought
to
bear.
these
three
principles
all
focus
--
all
point
to
one
conclusion
--
that
section
30(a)
is
not
enforceable.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
no,
your
honor,
it
--
it
is
not.
i
mean,
in
the
sense
that
it
can't
go
out
immediately
and
get
an
injunction,
your
honor
is
correct.
however,
the
government
has
the
power
to
deny
a
state--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--well,
its
only
remedy
provided
by
statute
is
to
terminate
funds.
however,
it
is
not
a
drastic
remedy,
it
--
and
it
is
the
remedy
that's
provided
by
statute.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
how
often
does
it
happen?
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
very
rarely,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
way
that
most
state
plan
amendments
operate
is
that
these
issues
are
resolved
on
a
consensual
basis,
generally
within
the
90
days
provided
by
regulation.
this
case
is
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
there
is
no
end
run
here
because
hhs's
own
regulations
provide
that
our
time
for
submitting
the
state
--
state
plan
amendment
is
within
the
90
days
that
the
amendment
will
take
effect,
and
hhs
will
confirm
that
--
it's
the
position
of
the
federal
government
that
the
state
may
implement
its
rate
reductions
while
the
state
plan
amendment
is
pending.
it
does
so
at
the
risk
that,
if
a
state
plan
amendment
is
disapproved,
that
it
may
have
to
pay
additional
funds.
but
we
did
not
do
an
end
run
around
anything.
we
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
administrative
process.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
i
don't
believe
so.
and
that's
because
in--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--well,
and
i
think
what's
very
important
to
focus
on
here
is
that
this
is
not
just
any
federal
statute
that
is
being
enforced,
but
it
is
a
spending
clause
provision
that
is
vague
and
ambiguous
in
its
terms.
it
cries
--
it
has
all
these
policy
elements
to
it
and
it
cries
out
for
administrative
review.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
i
have
two
answers,
your
honor.
one
is
that
i
don't
think
it
is
more
efficient
to
have
700
district
court
judges
interpreting
a
statute
that
does
not
have
any
objective
standard,
but
that
is
susceptible
to
many
different
interpretations.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
but
california
is
now
subject
to
standards
that
don't
apply
anywhere
else
in
the
country,
and
i
believe
the
court
acknowledged
exactly
this
problem
just
last
term
in
astra
v.
santa
clara
when
it
declined
to
allow
private
parties
to
use
a
contract
provision
to
do
an
end
run
around
gonzaga,
sandoval
versus
--
sandoval
v.
alexander;
i
think
i
have
that
reversed
--
and
the
other
cases
that,
based
on
separation
of
powers
of
principles,
based
on
spending
clause
principles,
limit
the
--
the
circumstances
in
which
private
parties
can
sue.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
yes.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
all
of
those
arguments
are
sufficient,
as
is
the
fact
that,
as
we
briefed,
the
supremacy
cause
itself
is
an
implied
cause
of
action.
but
let
me
focus
on
those
three
points.
these
are
points
--
the
rule
that
we
are
seeking
is
that
a
federal
statute
is
not
enforceable
unless
congress
intended
for
it
to
be
enforceable,
and
that
that
principle
has
special
force
with
respect
to
spending
clause
provisions
where
congress
has
to
clearly
and
unambiguously
provide
for
that
enforcement,
because
the
state
has
to
be
on
fair
notice
due
to
the
nature
of
the
spending
clause
of
the
obligations
to
which
it
is
agreeing.
that
is
pennhurst;
and
that
is
applied
with
even
greater
force
with
respect
to
30(a)
because
of
the
type
of
standards
that
it
incorporates.
if
it's
not
suitable
for
--
if
a
determination
applying
gonzaga
if
that
if
you
are
finding
under
1983
the
administrative
nature
and
flexible
nature
of
those
standards
is
not
appropriate
for
private
enforcement,
that
shouldn't
matter
what
vehicle
you
are
using
to
bring
the
case.
and
i
want
to
just
--
to
put
this
into
real
clear
context,
in
the
3
years
that
this
case
has
been
pending,
california
has
submitted
68
state
plan
amendments
outside
of
the
rate
context.
36
of
them
were
approved.
the
rest
were
withdrawn
voluntarily.
these
cases
--
and
they
were
all
approved,
almost
all
of
them
within
the
90-day
period.
so
the
administrative
process
works.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
these
are
non-rate
--
rate-related
amendments,
state
plan
amendments.
but
the
point
is
the
administrative
process
is
working.
we
obtained
--
and
it
resolves
in
the
usual
case
in
a
consensual
resolution
that
is
consistent
with
the
cooperative
nature
of
the
joint
venture
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--no,
i
don't
believe
the
injunctions
were
that
limited.
so
if
we
obtained
state
plan
approval
we
then
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
argue
over
what
the
impact
is
of
the
state
plan.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
no,
the
injunctions
were
not
so
conditional.
and
the
point
i
want
to
make
is,
the
injunctions
have
disrupted
the
administrative
process
as
it
is
intended
to
work
by
drawing
out
the
process,
by
politicizing
the
process,
by
prejudicing
our
ability
to
get
state
plan
approval
because
now
there
is
the
concern
about
what
about
retroactive
relief
when
they
approve
your
state
plan?
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
we
requested
that
in
some
of
these
cases
and
the
courts
ignored
that
argument.
and
so
the
upshot
is
that
we
are
now--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--there
is
no
cause
of
action,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
here.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
for
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
what
you're
doing
here,
what
the
court
is
doing
here,
is
enforcing
a
federal
statute.
you
look
through
the
supremacy
clause
to
the
obligation--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--it
is.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
they
did
seek
damages
and
they
obtained
damages
in
independent
living.
the
second
is
the
obligations
that
are
imposed,
the
study
requirement,
the
data
requirement,
all
these
obligations
are
imposed
by
30(a).
we
look
through
the
supreme
clause
to
the
statute
to
see
the
obligations.
so
the
question
is,
does
congress
get
to
control
who
enforces
those
obligations
or
not.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
first
just
one
point:
in
independent
living
they
did
claim
damages
and
they
obtained
damages.
but
setting
that
issue
aside,
no,
your
honor,
this
court
has
the
obligation
and
the
right
with
respect
to
constitutional
provisions
to
determine
how
they
will
be
enforced
subject
potentially
to
congressional
action,
but
there
is
far
more
latitude
for
the
court.
with
respect
to
statutes,
of
course,
as
this
court
is
explained
in
davis
v.
passman,
deference
to
congressional
intent
is
appropriate.
and
here--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--well,
if
--
if
the
plaintiffs
fell
within
--
yes.
if
the
plaintiffs
fell
within
of
the
bill
in
equity
to
restrain
enforce
proceedings
that
was
in
issue
in
ex
parte
young
and
that
justice
kennedy
has
discussed
in
terms
of
the
immunity
to
invalid
regulation,
then
the
result
would
be
different.
but
there
are
several
reasons
why--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--for
a
couple--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--well,
for
a
couple
of
different
reasons.
first
of
all,
a
defense,
which
is
what
you're
asserting
in
such
a
case,
is
not
a
cause
of
action,
and
so
it
doesn't
implicate
the
separation
of
powers
concerns
to
the
same
degree
as
a
stand-alone
cause
of
action
to
compel
the
state
to
comply
with
an
obligation
owed
to
another
entity.
also,
in
those
cases
there,
in
the
equity
cases
--
equity
doesn't
provide
a
remedy
just
for
an
injury.
you
have
to
have
an
invasion
of
what
in
old
times
was
called
a
primary
right.
but
what
that
means
is
a
right
to
property
or
a
right
in
the
person.
and
there
are
other
kinds
of
primary
rights.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
no
it
does
not,
because
we
have
not
threatened
to
enforce
that
statute.
they
are
not
arguing
that
statute
is
preempted.
the
statute
that
they--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--and
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
it
would
be
a
closer
case,
although
even
in
that
context,
because
in
the
spending
clause
context
in
which
the
case
arises
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
be
able
to
challenge
that
under
the
supremacy
clause.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
that
case
at
least
presents
the
fact
--
and
the
reason
why
it's
a
closer
case
is
because
in
that
case
there
is
regulation
and
we
are
potentially
infringing
on
their
property.
however,
what's
the
law
that
they
are
trying
to
assert
defensively
there
is,
as
a
spending
clause
provision
that
has
administrative
standards
that
have
been
entrusted
to
congress.
so
shouldn't
congress
be
able
to
enforce
it?
fundamentally,
this
court--
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
--of
course
we
would,
and
they
would
have
a
decision
about
whether
to
stay
in
the
medicaid
program
or
not.
but
the
question
is
does
this
court
exercise
its
equitable
powers
to
create
a
cause
of
action
directly
that
congress
itself
has
not?
that's
really
the
question
for
this
court.
in
the
spending
clause
context
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
standard
that
is
suited
for
administrative
standards,
we
submit
you
should
not.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
our
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
thank
you,
your
honor,
so
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
medicaid
act
that
are
privately
enforceable.
this
one
is
not.
i've
would
like
to
address
the
court's
questions
about
ex
parte
young.
ex
parte
young
of
course
involved
a
constitution
--
the
due
process
clause
and
not
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
substance
of
the
constitution
that
was
being
enforced
and
the
plaintiff
had
an
independent
pre-standing
personal
right
in
ex
parte
young
in
all
of
the
cases
that
are
its
progeny.
now
there
is
another
--
i
want
to
address
justice
alito's
point
about
do
we
apply
the
right's
required
in
ex
parte
young
causes
of
action.
yes
you
do,
alexander
v.
sandoval,
california
v.
sierra
club,
blessing
versus
freestone.
look
at
alexander
v.
sandoval.
the
state
passes
a
constitutional
amendment
that
says
english
only.
the
state
adopts
a
policy,
english-only
drivers
tests.
this
is
challenged
as
conflicting
with
federal
law
and
specifically
a
federal
regulation.
the
court
said
no
court
is
satisfied.
congress
drafted
that
statute,
it
controls
who
gets
to
enforce
them.
ms.
karin
s.
schwartz
no,
i'm
not.
the
test
for
whether
there
is
an
ex
parte
--
there
is
different
means
of
ex
parte
young,
but
none
of
them
apply
here.
you
can
see
ex
parte
young
as
construing
a
cause
of
action
under
the
due
process
clause.
this
not
a
cause
of
action
under
the
due
process
clause.
you
can
see
ex
parte
young
as
involving
a
specific
kind
of
bill
in
equity
which
is
a
defense
of
regulation
of
your
conduct
where
that
regulation
infringes
a
personal
or
property
right.
that
is
not
this
case.
there
is
no
regulation
of
respondent's
conduct
and
there
is
no
infringement
of
a
personal
or
property
right
in
this
case.
the
only
entity
that's
being
regulated
by
the
state
--
by
the
state
statute
that
purportedly
is
being
--
well,
that
is
being
challenged
as
preempted,
is
the
state
of
california
itself
because
we
are
the
entity
that
sets
rates
and
so
the
statute
tells
the
agency,
this
is
how
you
will
set
rates.
so
however
you
look
at
ex
parte
young,
plaintiffs
cannot
satisfy
the
elements
of
an
ex
parte
young
cause
of
action.
what
i'm
saying
with
respect
to
alexander
v.
sandoval
and
these
other
cases
is
injury
is
not
enough.
you
have
to
have
a
--
a
right.
under
equity
injury,
it's
never
been
enough,
and
it's
not
enough
under
this
court's
separation
of
powers
decisions
and
its
spending
clause
cases.
and
i
wanted
to
segue
very
quickly
to
this
idea
that
there
is
a
default
rule
that
a
supremacy
clause
cause
of
action
exists
by
default
the.
that
is
absolutely
not
true,
and
it's
not
true
in
this
context,
and
i'd
like
to
identify
two
reasons.
first,
the
suter
fix.
the
--
congress
acted
in
this
court
in
suter,
said
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action.
and
it
said
just
because
something
is
in
a
--
in
an
estate
plan,
doesn't
render
it
unenforceable.
but
we
want
to
preserve
the
holding
in
suter.
look,
it
--
that
suggests
that
other
things
are
unenforceable;
that
congress
is
not
act
--
legislating
against
a
backdrop
of
an
assumption
that
there
is
an
injunctive
relief
to
the
claim,
or
it
wouldn't
have
required
it.
in
maine
v.
thibotout,
another
case
that
assumes,
that
recognizes
that
with
respect
to
spending
clause
actions,
the
sole
means
--
the
spending
clause
statute,
the
means,
the
vehicle
for
enforcing
is
1983.
and
finally,
in
the
spending
clause
context,
we
have
the
clear
state
role
which
is
incompatible
with
the
assumption
that
a
cause
of
action
always
exists.
because
the
state
has
to
have
knowing
and
acceptance
--
knowing
and
accepting
its
obligations,
we
require
that
they
reassert
statement.
thank
you,
your
honor.
