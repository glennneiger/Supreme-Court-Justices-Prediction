mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i've
would
like
to
focus
on
two
points
that
came
out
of
the
questioning
in
the
first
part
of
the
oral
argument
today.
first
of
all
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
question
--
the
comment
at
least
and
the
question
that
flows
from
it
from
justice
alito
which
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
recognition
of
a
third-party
action
in
the
ex
parte
young
case.
that
is
true
and
i
didn't
hear
anything
from
the
other
side
that
suggests
anything
to
the
contrary.
and
that
what
this
court
said
in
the
verizon
case
and
in
shaw
when
you
look
to
the
supremacy
clause
arising-under
jurisdiction
and
if
you
look
to
jurisdiction
you
look
to
the
traditional
equitable
standards
to
determine
whether
they
have
been
satisfied
in
a
particular
case.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
ex
parte
young,
what
the
court
said
was
an
injunction
which
restrains
the
state
from
taking
any
steps
to
the
enforcement
of
an
unconstitutional
enactment
to
the
injury
of
the
complainant
is
the
basis
for
relief.
and
that's
exactly
the
circumstance
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
very
fundamental
difference
between
an
implied
right
of
action
or
an
action
under
section
1983
and
a
very
simple
and
straightforward
ex
parte
young
remedy
that
is
otherwise
available.
under
1983,
in
private
rights
of
action,
the
district
courts,
the
federal
courts,
state
courts
for
that
matter
in
enforcing
them,
have
authority
to
grant
damages,
they
have
much
broader
injunctive
relief,
and
under
section
1983--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
ex
parte
young
has
been
pretty
consistently
evaluated
as
saying
simply
you
cannot
do
what
the
constitution
immediately
prohibits
you
from
doing.
so
frankly,
the
ex
parte
young
remedy
has
been
a
negative--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--not
to
violate
--
not
to
violate
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
cases
in
which
1983
relief
has
been
involved,
a
case
like
blessing
--
in
blessing,
the
complaint
there
sought
essentially
to
take
over
the
entire
state
law
function
of
providing
support
for
children.
and
that
was
the
injunctive
relief
that
was
requested.
and
if
the
court
had
adopted
the
motion
that
1983
carried
with
it
a
private
right
of
action,
that
would
have
been
available
relief;
there
would
have
been
a
claim
for
damages
in
that
circumstance;
and
there
would
have
been
access
to
attorneys'
fees.
none
of
those
things
is
available
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
that
--
in
that
situation,
there
is
obviously
no
authority
to
bring
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
statute.
that
still
doesn't
answer
the
question
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
to
invoke
the
supremacy
clause--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--when
there
is
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
you
still
have
the
problem
that
even
under
those
circumstances
a
regime
can
arise
in
which
there
is
a
square
and,
in
this
case
i
think
undeniable,
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law,
and
the
question
is
--
and
that
that
conflict
imposes
not
only
injury
in
fact
to
an
individual,
but
also
imposes
irreparable
harm.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
whether
or
not
you
would
in
fact
get
relief
under
the
supremacy
clause
seems
to
me
a
very--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
think
congress
has
the
authority
to
essentially
say
there
are
some
conflicts
between
federal
and
state
law
that
we
will
simply
ignore
even
though
it
causes
irreparable
harm--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely
not.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
and
it
seems
to
me
here
is
a
situation
where
you
would
expect
congress
to
have
spoken
explicitly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
course.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
the
reason
why
the
default
rule
would
almost
certainly
be
that
in
fact
you
can
bring
the
ex
parte
young
cause
of
action
is
because
the
effect
--
the
spending
clause
has
been
subject
to
the
--
to
preemption
claims
since
1968.
this
whole
notion
that
they
contracted
against
this
background
of
what
obligations
did
they
assume,
the
obligation
that
they
clearly
would
have
assumed
is
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
violation
of
federal
law
based
on
a
failure
to
satisfy
one
of
the
conditions
of
spending
under
these
circumstances,
you
would
--
they
would
be
susceptible
to
an
ex
parte
young
injunctive
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
can
i
just--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--can
i
deal
with
that
one
immediately?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
i
think
it's
important
in
the
context
of
this
case
to
recognize
it.
we
are
talking
about
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
that
was
designed
to
hold
everything
until
matters
could
be
avoided.
we
realize
that
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
state,
solely
for
budgetary
reasons,
without
regard
to
federal
law
whatsoever,
simply
made
a
slash
in
the
reimbursements.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
what
i
just
wanted
to
be
clear
on.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
third
possibility
it
seems
to
me,
justice
breyer,
is
not
different
from
a
lot
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
already
decided,
crosby
and
like
engine
manufacturers,
where
there's
this
vague
standard
out
here
and
they're
not
asserting
a
right
not
to
have
an
enforcement
action
brought
against
them,
and
this
court
has
routinely
held
in
that
circumstance
that
there
is
in
fact
a
supremacy
clause
action
available.
so
i
don't
think
the
third
option
is
really
an
option.
and
it
also
ultimately
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
preemption
claim.
if
it
turns
out
that
all
of
this
is
just
too
squishy
to
evaluate,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
on
the
merits
you
would
say
it
is
not
a
clear
enough
statement
on
the
federal
law
to
justify
saying
there
is
a
conflict,
and
therefore
you
would
lose
on
the
merits.
but
that
wouldn't
prevent
you
from
going
into
court
and
trying
to
make
the
showing
that
we
made
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
justice
breyer,
the
agency
always
has
the
ultimate
authority
to
step
in
and
take
action
and
the
real
question
is
to
think
that
congress
meant
to
place
this
in
an
agency
to
circumstances
where
the
agency
isn't
going
to
receive
notice
of
the
implementation
of
the
change
before
it
gets
implemented,
where
the
state
is
permitted
to
take
no
--
to
make
no
response
to
a
request
for
information
and
allow
the
unlawful
rates
to
go
into
effect
for
years
on
end.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
didn't
think
i
was.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
doctrine.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that.
candidly,
we
--
we
would
be
perfectly
comfortable
about
that;
but
i
don't
understand
the
other
side
to
be
complaining
about
the
scope
of
the
injunctive
relief.
it
is
not
that
they
are
saying--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
and
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
did
have
an
alternative
argument
that
the
injunction
should
stay
into
effect
at
least
until
hhs
acts,
and
the
--
the
district
court
granted
a
broader
preliminary
injunction
and
didn't
consider
the
alternative
argument
that
was
--
that
was
there.
but
again,
it
seems
to
me,
you
know,
the
court
ought
to
recognize
that
you
are
in
the
context
of
preliminary
injunctive
relief
in
this
situation,
and
--
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
kind
of
work
through
the
nature
of
the
injunctive
relief
if
in
fact
the
court's
allowed
to
go
forward
and
take
up
the
ex
parte
young
issue
--
in
the
circumstance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
am
not
perfectly
comfortable
with
that
rationale.
i
think
the
answer
is
it's
sort
of
a
combination
of
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
--
and
broad
equitable
relief,
rather
than
--
i
mean,
clearly
one
or
the
other.
they
seem
to
go
pretty
much
hand-in-glove
in
the
ex
parte
line
of
cases.
and
so
i
don't
have
any
particular
problem
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
will
depend
on
the
--
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
but
i
do
think
there
is
some
gap
between
the
full
extent
of
congress's
power
in
this
area
and
--
and
the
protections
of
the
supremacy
clause,
if
for
no
other
reason
--
and
because
the
executive
branch
certainly
has
the
authority,
and
certainly
acting
within
its
own
exclusive
authority
could
--
could
preempt
state
law
or
could
create
a
situation
where
state
law
would
be
preempted,
and
i
don't
think
congress
would
have
the
authority
to
--
to
take
away
the
ex
parte
young
remedy
under
--
under
those
particular
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
--
i
mean,
to
be
sure,
the
court
in
ex
parte
young
was
dealing
with
a
specific
situation
in
trying
to
prevent
enforcement.
but
the
--
the
supreme
court
--
this
court
in
all
of
its
decisions
post
ex
parte
young
has
never
said
that
that's
the
only
circumstance
and
has
certainly
never
said
that
in
exercising
the
judicial
power
under
article
iii
that
extends
to
all
cases
in
equity,
that
it
means
only
the
equity
that
existed
in
--
in
the
18th
century
at
that
point
in
time.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
right
answer
at
this
stage
is
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
situation
and
safe
is
this
a
context
in
which
equitable
relief
would
be
appropriate?
and
if
you
just
use
the
preliminary
injunction
standards,
it
clearly
would
be
appropriate
under
--
under
these
particular
circumstances,
where
we
have
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
irreparable
harm
and
the
balance
of
harms
favor
the
--
favor
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
all--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
any
of
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
recognized
that
obviously
in
order
to
get
--
in
order
to
get
injunctive
relief
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
there
--
that
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
at
law.
so,
i
mean,
the
distinction
has
always
been
there,
even
after
of
the
merging
of
law
and
equity--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
the
earlier
part
of
the
--
century.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
asking
for
--
for
--
i
mean,
we
are
not
asking
for
damages
here,
justice
scalia.
all
we're
asking
for
is
injunctive
relief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but
i
--
i
mean
all
of
the
cases
that
come
out
of
the
ex
parte
young
line
of
authority
seem
to
base
--
you
know,
they
all
tee
up,
obviously,
the
problem
that
exists
in
this
context
which
is
--
which
is
the
one
justice
scalia
identified.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
can
i
--
two
points
here.
first
of
all,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
situation
of
somebody
seeking
a
roving
commission
to
go
find
all
federal
--
all
situations
where
state
law
violates
federal
law.
we're
--
the
beneficiaries
in
this
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
my
people
have
a
life
and
death
problem,
justice
breyer.
so
if
there
were
ever
a
situation
where
you
would
say,
let's
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
relief
available,
this
would
be
the
situation
where
--
where
i
would
hope--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the
beneficiaries--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
patients
are
the
one
whose
lose
access
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
to
be
sure,
justice
breyer.
the
exception
is
that
we
have
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
article
iii,
we
have
to
have
injury
and
redressability,
and
in
order
to
get
equitable
relief,
we
ultimately
are
going
to
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
injury
is
irreparable,
that
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
at
law.
those
are
high
burdens--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
in
a
circumstance
where
you
cannot
get
damages
and
you
cannot
get
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
they
had
just
discussed
the
matter?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
wouldn't
be
here.
i
guarantee
you
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
--
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
so
there's
no
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
the
agency
always
wins.
that's
the
rule
that
they--
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
--
i
mean
--
i
mean,
if
the
agency--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
also
depends
on
whether
they
go
ahead
and
--
if
california,
in
the
face
of
disapproval,
continues
to
violate
the
law
--
and
i
would
--
i
assume
you
meant
that
california
complied.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit,
justice
alito--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the
bottom
line
is
you're
going
to
lose
that
--
that
litigation,
and
in
a
circumstance
where
you
have
no
realistic--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
ultimately,
they
have
to
demonstrate
that
there's
--
that
there
is
a
--
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law,
and
the
agency
that
has
made
--
that
evaluates
the
standards
of
federal
law
will
have
said
in
a
very
authoritative
way
that
there
is
not
a
violation
under
those--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--one
has
to
be
sure
of
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
saying
you
don't,
i'm
just
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
the
process
works
appropriately,
there
would
be
not
the
litigation
that
justice
breyer
was
worried
about,
where
you
would
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
going
forward.
if
the
process
--
which
again,
it
goes
back
to
the
default
rule--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--sure,
we
would
still
say
there's
a--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
would
still
have
an
argument
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
problem
with
the
apa
--
we
might
have
an
apa
cause
of
action,
but
i
also
think
that
there
is
a
--
again,
look,
that
hypothetical
is
so
far
afield--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
of
course
federal
law
is
determined
by
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
you
--
i
still
think
you
can
bring
an
action
under
the
supremacy
clause.
i
think
ultimately
you
have
very
--
you
have
zero
ultimately
prevailing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
congress--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
doesn't
--
that
controls,
to
the
extent
of
trying
to
enforce
directly
the
federal
statute;
it
doesn't
control
with
respect
to
trying
to
enforce
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
there,
what
the
supremacy
clause
says
is
that
federal
law
will
be
supreme
in
all
circumstances,
notwithstanding
state
law--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
supremacy
clause
--
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
exceptions
in
the
supremacy
clause
where
state
law
gets
to
remain
supreme--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--not
--
not
--
not
that
--
not
that
--
not
what
the
agency
has
done
violates
the
supremacy
clause,
it's
the
state
acting
pursuant
to
what
the
agency
has
approved,
that
if
you
still
thought
it
violated
federal
law
would
be
a
basis
for
seeking
a
supremacy
clause
action.
but
no,
justice
scalia's
right,
the
obvious
solution
to
the
immediate
problem
is
to
seek
review
of
the
decision
by
hhs,
and
to
follow
it
under
those
circumstances.
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
focus
a
little
bit
about,
because
it
does
seem
to
me
--
again,
it
goes
to
what
are
--
what
should
be
the
background
principles
that
operate
here.
and
a
couple
of
justices
specifically
raised
the
question
of,
you
know,
would
this
case
be
different
if
we
were
seeking
to
balance
the
bill
--
that
is
to
bill
the
extent
to
which
we
were
allowed
to
bill
prior
to
the
time
the
state
of
california
reduced
by
10
percent.
if
we
brought
that
lawsuit,
would
that
be
perfectly
permissible?
and
i
understand
california
i
think
suggested
that
it
would
be,
and
i
heard
mr.
kneedler
suggest
that
well,
there
might
be
some
additional
issues
there.
but
the
reality
is,
is
it
seems
to
me
that
shows
you
just
how
unrealistic
the
distinction
is
in
this
particular
case,
because
we
are
talking
about
individuals
--
the
question
is
not,
you
know,
how
are
you
going
to
implement
this
down
the
road.
the
question
is,
what
do
you
do
with
someone
who
is
suffering
a
lack
of
access
to
vital
medical
care
in
a
way
that
is
irreparable,
and
is
it
realistic
to
think
that
congress
meant
under
those
circumstances
to
deprive
the
individual
plaintiff
of
any
kind
of
rights.
and
the
answer
is
no.
and
that's
--
that's
as
far
as
the
court
needs
to
go.
it
doesn't
need
to
figure
out
exactly
how
far
congress
could
deal
with
the
supremacy
clause.
i
realize
that
there
is
some
skepticism
on
that
score.
but
on
the
core
question
here,
did
congress
intend
to
deprive
these
plaintiffs
of
their
rights
under
ex
parte
young?
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
there
is
a
difference
between
providing
a
private
right
of
action
and
all
the
bells
and
whistles
that
go
with
that,
as
opposed
to
recognizing
that
ex
parte
young
is
the
background
principle
that
has
been
in
place
for
well
over
a
century,
and
that
it
says
that
when
the
standards
for
equitable
relief
are
satisfied,
the
courts
have
the
power,
and
they
can
prevent
the
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
have
been
perfectly
comfortable
with
that.
i
mean,
that
was
one
of
the
alternative
grounds
for
relief
that
we
sought.
the
district
judge
didn't
happen
to
go
down
that
particular
path.
but
clearly
from
our
perspective,
the
important
element
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo
ante
until
a
resolution
of
the
legality
of
california
statute
can
be
made,
either
by
the
agency
or
the
courts.
but
the
one
thing
you
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
is
simply
to
--
to
permit
this
to
drift
without
any
remedy
and
without
any
ability
to
get
access
to
medical
care
that's
clearly
consistent
with
what
congress
intended,
and
where
a
remedy
is
available
under
the
ex
parte
young
formulation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor.
