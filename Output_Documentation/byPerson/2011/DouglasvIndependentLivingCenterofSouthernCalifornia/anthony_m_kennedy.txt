could
a
state
in
its
own
courts
provide
for
procedures
whereby
adversely
affected
parties
could
test
the
regulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
say
that.
otherwise
the
next
question
would
be
under
gonzaga,
you
wouldn't
say
that
a
state
can
entertain
a
monetary
cause
of
action,
so
i
think
that's
consistent
with
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
you
say
--
that
brings
me
to
a
slightly
different
point.
you
--
you
introduce
the
fact
or
the
consideration
of
what's
administratively
workable.
the
brief
by
the
former
hhs
officials
says
quite
to
the
contrary.
it
--
it
says
that
there
are
almost
$400
billion
of
hhs
expenditures
that
are
supervised
by
50
people.
that
works
out
to
800
million
each;
and
they
say,
we
don't
have
time
for
this,
and
it's
much
more
efficient
and
it's
much
more
consistent
with
the
application
of
--
proper
application
of
federal
law,
to
allow
this
action
be
brought
in
the
--
in
the
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
that's
7
--
700
judges.
it
would
be
just
each
district
if
it
were
in
every
district.
and
it
--
it
--
and
certainly
to
the
extent
we
are
involving
a
state,
there
would
be
only
one
state
involved.
so
--
so
there
is
just
the
state
of
california
and
only
four
districts
there
and
the
suit
could
only
be
brought
in
one.
so
--
i
think
that's
an
--
you
know,
i
don't
think
that
the
"sky
is
falling"
argument
really
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
courts
i
take
it
have
the
prerogative,
perhaps
even
the
obligation,
under
the
primary
jurisdiction
rational
to
simply
withhold
adjudication
until
the
agency
acts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
not
an
absence
of
power.
you're
arguing
an
absence
of
power.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
a
preemption,
would
it
be
a
preemption
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
if
the
state
shows
to
allow
its
courts
to
issue
an
injunction
on
supremacy
clause
grounds
in
the
state
courts
that
that
would
be
impermissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
best
authority
in
our
cases
other
than
ex
parte
young
or
in
a
treatise
or
in
recognized
statements
of
the
difference
in
law
and
equity,
for
the
proposition
that
in
this
area
we
can
make
a
distinction
between
law
and
equity
after
centuries
in
which
we
have
tried
to
say
that
that
distinction
ought
to
be
blurred?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
do
you
want
us
--
do
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
and
say
oh,
there
is
a
difference
in
damages
and
equity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
i
--
other
than
ex
parte
young,
what
do
i
site
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know,
but
see
--
but
that
--
but
that
wouldn't
explain
the
case
like
gonzaga
where
there
was
no
state
entity.
gonzaga
was
a
private
institution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i'm
--
i'm
wondering.
i
understand
the
eleventh
amendment
dynamic
which--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
was
the
whole
driving
force
of
--
of
ex
parte
young.
is
there
--
is
there
any
other
basis
for
us
to
say
there
has
to
be
a
law/equity
distinction?
you
say
well,
that's
because
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
at
law;
but
that's
circular;
that
assumes
because
there
is
no
cause
of
action.
so
that
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
supremacy
clause
says
that
judges
in
every
state
shall
be
bound
thereby,
but
you
want
to
amend
it
so
that
judges
in
every
state
and
all
administrators
should
be
bound
thereby,
then
you
have
a
supremacy
clause
action
against
every
federal
agency.
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
number
one,
it
doesn't
say
that.
there's
no
--
it
doesn't
say
"all
circumstances".
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
justice
scalia's
question
was
related
to
a
federal
agency.
the
federal
agency
does
something
that's
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
arguably,
and
you
say
there
is
a
supremacy
clause
violation?
that's
--
i
don't--
