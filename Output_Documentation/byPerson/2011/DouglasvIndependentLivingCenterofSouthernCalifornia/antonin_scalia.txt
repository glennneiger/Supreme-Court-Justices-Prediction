excuse
me.
you
spoke
of
that,
justice
ginsburg's
question,
as
though
it
were
a
hypothetical.
but
that
could
happen,
couldn't
it?
what
if
one
of
these
respondents
charged
more
than
the
state
law
permits?
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
state
move
against
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
they
have
to
do
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
is
amend
their
complaint
to
say,
"we
intend
to
charge
higher
rates
than
the
state
law
allows.
"
and
then
you
would
agree
that
the
suit
would
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
gee,
we're
not
deciding
a
whole
lot
here,
then.
it's
just
a
matter
of
pleading
that
we're
deciding.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not
even
exclude
all
spending
clause
cases.
you
only
exclude
those
spending
clause
cases
where
--
where
the
plaintiff
does
not
say
we
are
--
you
know,
we
are
going
to
violate
the
state
law,
and
they
are
going
to
come
after
us.
so
you
haven't
made
an
exception
for
the
spending
clause--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not
the
theory
on
which
we've
said
you
can't
get
damages
under
ex
parte
young.
the
theory
that
prevents
damages
is
the
theory
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
--
the
fiction
that
you're
--
the
fiction
that
you're
moving
against
the
individual
and
not
against
the
state
simply
cannot
be
maintained
when
you
are
taking
money
out
of
the
state
treasury.
that's
the
basis
for
it,
not
--
not
just
what
you
just
described.
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
lost
me
here.
you
say
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause
if
the
agency
approves
the
rates,
but
your
clients
don't
think
the
rates
are
high
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
federal
law
is
determined
by
the
agency,
surely.
so
long
as
the
agency
is
complying
with
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
don't
see
how
you
have
any
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause;
you
may
have
an
apa
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
law
is
not
determined
by
the
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
law
is
not
determined
by
of
the
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
don't
have
a
supremacy
clause
cause
of
action.
