chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-958,
douglas
v.
independent
living
center
of
southern
california
and
the
consolidated
cases.
ms.
schwartz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
is
your
argument
in
this
case
limited
to
spending
clause
legislation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
you
think
there
may
well
be
implied
rights
of
action
outside
the
spending
clause
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question
was
that
you
were
not
arguing
about
that
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
government
--
the
government,
we
don't
have
a
position
from
the
government
on
whether
or
not
there
is
an
implied
right
of
action
under
other
constitutional
provisions--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
mean
outside
the
spending
clause
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
phillips?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
--
why
doesn't
your
position
constitute
a
complete
end
run
around
all
of
our
implied
right
of
action
jurisprudence?
we
have
wasted
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
figure
out
whether
there's
an
implied
right
of
action
under
a
particular
statute
if
there
has
always
been
one
under
the
supremacy
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
they
have
much
broader
--
broader
--
first
of
all,
all
of
those
cases
--
i
don't
know
if
all
of
them
did,
but
certainly
a
lot
of
them
did
--
included
claims
for
injunctive
relief.
and
i
would
have
thought
the
court's
authority
under
your
equitable
action
under
the
constitution
would
be
at
least
as
broad
as
it
would
be
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
position--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
position
is
that
the
constitution
prohibits
you
from
doing
anything
where
the
state
law
is
preempted
by
the
federal
law.
that
doesn't
sound
very
narrow
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
law
that
congress
passes
sets
forth
certain
federal
standards,
it's
a
cooperative
federal-state
law
like
this
one,
and
it
says:
and
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
for
any
individual
to
enforce
this.
that's
limited
to
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
congress
can
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--congress
can
say
in
the
same
statute
that
confers
the
allegedly
preemptive
federal
standards
that
we
do
not
want
individuals
bringing
actions
in
court
to
enforce
this.
we
want
to
leave
that
up
to
hhs.
and
you
are
saying,
even
though
congress
said
that,
individuals
can
nonetheless
bring
a
suit
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
theory
of
which
is
we
are
making
sure
that
federal
law
controls.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
same
federal
law
that
says
you
can't
bring
a
claim
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
there
no
suit
--
why
is
there
no
suit
if
the
agency
doesn't
approve,--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you're
saying
congress
can't
say
there's
no
implied
right
of
action--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
agency
can?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
the
same
answer
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
you
still
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
saying
you
didn't,
if
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--agency
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
does
the
agency
get
to
determine
federal
law
when
congress
doesn't?
you
told
me
earlier
if
congress--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--congress
says
it
its
statute
no
implied
right
of
action,
that
that
doesn't
control.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
answer
is
yes,
they
intended
to
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
sue
under
the
statute.
i
understand
that
you're
not
challenging
the
proposition
that
this
statute,
when
congress
was
specifically
focused
on
the
question
of
how
to
enforce
this
provision,
they
did
not
provide
a
right
of
action.
and
under
our
implied
right
of
action
jurisprudence,
that
means
there
isn't
one.
so
why
when
they
are
confronted
with
the
precise
question
did
they
say
no,
we
don't
want
these
people
to
sue,
but
you
say
well,
they
knew
under
the
constitution
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
anyway?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
schwartz,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
09-958,
douglas
versus
independent
living
center
and
the
consolidated
cases.
