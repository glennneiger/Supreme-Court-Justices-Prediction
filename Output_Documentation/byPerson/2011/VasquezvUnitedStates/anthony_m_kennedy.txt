my
--
my
problem
is
i
--
i
can
accept
that
formulation
certainly
for
purposes
of
this
case.
i
just
don't
see
where
in
the
opinion
--
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
focused
on
the
wrong
test.
it
didn't
use
the
magic
words
--
and
it
started
out
with,
let's
look
at
the
big
picture,
and
it
said:
well,
here's
the
defense
he
elected
to
put
on,
and
this
is
a
tough
sell
because.
but
then
it
quotes
what
happens
with
the
jury.
it
--
and
it
--
it
ends
its
analysis
for
saying
we
--
this
evidence
would
have
moved
the
jury
to
convict
vasquez
without
a
nudge
from
anything
it
heard
in
the
government's
case.
i
just
--
i
just
don't
see
that
you've
supported
your
theory
by
what
the
--
by
what
the
court
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
--
where
is
that?
where
is
that
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
in
--
in
the
context
of
the
opinion,
and
this
was
my
first
question,
they
then
proceed
to
--
to
analyze
it
and
that's
toward
the
very
end
of
this
discussion,
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
and
it
concludes
"from
this
evidence
we
believe
--
this
evidence
we
believe
would
have
moved
the
jury
to
convict.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
your
argument
is
something
like
this.
let's
assume
there
are
ten
pieces
of
evidence.
evidence
1
through
9
is
properly
admitted.
evidence
item
10
is,
a,
wrongfully
admitted,
and,
b,
so
prejudicial
that
that's
all
the
jury
looked
at.
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
of
that.
i
think
this
is
your
argument:
if
the
jury
was
so
obsessed,
focused,
transfixed
by
item
10,
which
was
improperly
admitted,
what
would
happen
if
we
concluded
that
this
jury
in
this
case
on
these
facts
if
they
had
looked
at
1
through
9
would
have
convicted?
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
not
only
saying
it's
possible
to
convict,
but
that
likely
probably
would
have
happened.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
my
hypothetical
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
if
the
jury
had
looked
at
1
through
9,
which
was
properly
admitted
before
them
in
this
trial,
they
would
have
convicted,
likely.
then
the
hypothetical
is:
we
don't
think
they
did
because
this
item
was
so
prejudicial
that
that's
all
they
looked
at.
is
that
what
your
argument
is?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
stronger
than
the
argument
you
are
making.
i'm
not
sure
even
that
works
for
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
have
a
case
in
which
after
the
verdict
of
guilty
there's
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
it's
being
heard
by
the
trial
judge,
and
the
trial
judge
said:
i
now
acknowledge
that
this
court
committed
error
in
introducing
item
10
in
evidence.
and
the
court
remembers
that
when
this
came
into
evidence,
the
courtroom
was
quiet,
the
jury
was
transfixed,
jurors
were
weeping.
this
was
the
high
point
of
the
trial.
that's
wrong
for
the
judge
to
say.
all
he
has
to
say
is:
well,
i
have
to
ask
whether
items
9
--
1
through
9
would
have
been
in
some
other
jury,
the
rational
jury,
so
that's
the
end
of
it.
judges
do
the
--
do
what
i
suggested
all
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
the
judge
concludes
that
both
this
jury
that
i
had,
and
some
hypothetical
rational
jury
would
have
been
so
focused
on
this
evidence
that
that's
all
they
would
have
looked
at,
but
if
they
had
looked
at
1
through
9,
the
admissible
evidence,
they
would
still
have
found
guilt.
is
that
--
is
that
what
you're
--
is
that
a
--
a
proper
application
of
the
--
of
the
framework?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
chief
justice
allowed
me
to
ask
one
question.
can
i
amend
your
statement
so
that
you
would
say
a
rational
jury
in
all
the
circumstances
of
this
case
given
what
this
jury
heard,
would
have?
