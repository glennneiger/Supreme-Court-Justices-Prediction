justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
correct
that
the
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's
position
is
that
the
government
says
the
focus
should
be
on
a
rational
jury,
and
you
say
the
focus
should
be
on
this
particular
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
i
understand.
but
beyond
that
i
really
don't
understand
the
difference
between
the
two
positions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
let
me
read
you
two
sentences
and
tell
me
whether
you
think
there
is
a
difference
between
them.
first
one:
"is
there
a
fair
possibility
that
this
particular
evidence
caused
the
jury
to
convict?
"
second
statement:
"is
there
a
fair
possibility
that
this
jury
would
have
--
this
jury
would
have
convicted
without
the
evidence?
"
do
you
see
a
difference
between
those
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
look.
if
you
win
your
client
will
get
a
new
trial.
let's
suppose
that
the
new
trial
is
exactly
like
the
trial
that
took
place.
every
single
thing
is
the
same
except
the
error
is
corrected.
all
right.
isn't
that
essentially
the
harmless-error
analysis?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
maybe
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
its
application
of
the
harmless-error
test.
i
don't
think
that's
the
reason
why
we
took
this,
why
we
took
this
case.
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
the
test.
now,
the
only
aspect
of
--
the
only
thing
that
i
understand
that
really
differentiates
your
position
from
the
government
with
respect
to
the
test
is
whether
the
focus
is
on
a
rational
jury
or
on
this
particular
jury.
and
when
you
say
the
focus
should
be
on
this
particular
jury,
aren't
you
calling
for
a
speculation
by
the
--
by
an
appellate
court?
how
is
an
appellate
court
supposed
to
tell
whether
this
particular
jury
was
different
from
a
hypothetical
rational
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
yang,
you
may
be
taking
a
harder
position
than
you
really
need
to.
why
shouldn't
the
rule
be
that
the
--
the
appellate
court
should
look
at
what
would
be
done
by
a
rational
jury,
except
in
the
kind
of
extraordinary
circumstances
that
have
been
posited
by
justice
kagan's
hypothetical
and
a
few
of
the
other
questions,
simply
because
it's
so
difficult
to
determine
what
a
--
what
the
jury
was
actually
doing.
we
have
a
rule
that
prohibits
consideration
of
what
goes
on
in
the
jury
room.
but
suppose
we
didn't
have
that.
suppose
that
it
was
all
videotaped,
and
the
jury
didn't
know
what
was
going
on,
so
you
could
--
you
could
watch
it
and
see.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
surely
the
rule
would
be
what
would
this
jury
have
done?
but
most
of
the
time,
it's
just
speculation
to
tell
what
a
jury
--
what
they
did
--
did
they
come
back
quickly?
well,
that
shows
that
this
evidence
was
so
bad
that
it
caused
them
to
render
a
quick
verdict
in
what
otherwise
would
have
been
a
difficult
case.
did
they
take
a
long
time?
well,
it
shows
it
was
a
close
case,
and
therefore,
any
error
might
have
tipped
them
one
way
or
the
other.
you
just
can't
tell.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
the
panel
majority
in
--
did
the
panel
majority
in
this
case
say
anything
that
differs
from
what
this
court
has
said
about
harmless
error?
if
--
if
we
were
to
reverse,
what
would
we
point
to
in
the
panel
majority's
opinion
that
was
erroneous?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
hasn't
--
hasn't
this
court
said
exactly
what
seventh
circuit
said
there?
in
other
cases?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
want
us
to
say
--
you
want
us
to
say
we're
reversing
you,
seventh
circuit
panel,
because
you
said
what
we
have
said
in
prior
cases,
but
we
were
wrong?
