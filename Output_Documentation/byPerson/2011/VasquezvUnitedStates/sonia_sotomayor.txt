justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
the
error
actually
was?
i
see
--
and
you
can
add
another
--
three
potential
things
about
these
calls
or
three
potential
errors:
one,
that
they
proved
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
she
was
biased.
but,
as
the
majority
points
out,
she
already
said
she
was
before
the
tapes
were
played.
so
whatever
error
may
have
been
occasioned
by
the
jury
using
the
tapes
as
for
the
truth,
it
really
was
cumulative
to
an
already
admitted
bias.
the
second
is
some
sort
of
ambiguous
statement
by
her
that
all
of
them
were
in
trouble,
meaning
all
the
defendants,
and
a
similar
statement
by
the
petitioner's
lawyer.
so
what
was
it
that
was
error
that
affected
or
influenced
the
jury
among
these
three
choices?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
was
never
referenced
in
the
summations,
however,
or
in
the
reply.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
the
error
that
you
think--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--influenced
this
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
now,
tell
me
what
in
this
record
reflects
that
influence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
fact
that
they
asked
for
her
testimony,
well,
she
was
your
client's
entire
defense.
so
what
does
the
asking
for
her
testimony
show
that
they
were
interested
in
that
particular
part
of
the
transcript?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
transcript?
the
transcript
of
her
testimony?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
get
a
little
more
practical
here?
i
think
i
understood
your
basic
argument,
which
is:
my
defense
was
by
this
one
woman,
the
wife
of
one
of
the
codefendants.
she
tells
a
story
and
if
the
jury
had
believed
her
story
they
would
have
acquitted
your
client.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
i
am
assuming
what
you're
saying
--
and
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
which
is
if
we
believe
that
the
error
committed
affected
her
credibility
in
a
meaningful
way,
that
that
deprived
you
of
a
defense.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
of
the
potential
of
convincing
the
jury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
assuming
that's
your
argument,
i
go
back
to
my
question,
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
what
you
said
to
me
earlier,
it
wasn't
about
believing
her
or
not;
it
was
about
believing
the
defense
attorney
when
--
whether
the
defense
attorney
thought
the
defendant
was
guilty
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
--
let's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--are
you
taking
the
position
in
this
case
that
a
reviewing
court
under
no
circumstance
could
conclude
that
this
error
was
harmless?
or
are
you
taking
the
position
in
this
case
that
the
court
here,
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think,
committed
review
error
and
we
should
send
it
back
for
them
to
do
it
the
right
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
how
to
separate
out
an
admitted
error
situation.
and
let
me
explain
why,
okay?
let's
assume
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
instead
of
this
tape
recording
the
improperly
admitted
evidence
was
a
confession
by
the
defendant.
would
you
be
prepared
to
say
that
in
a
circumstantial
case
of
guilt
--
now,
we've
already
said
that
confessions
are
one
of
the
most
powerful
pieces
of
harmful
error
--
that
in
this,
in
a
confession,
that
somehow
this
was
still
harmful
--
harmless?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
different
standard.
let's,
let's
talk
about
it
under
the
kehoda
standard.
let's
talk
about
the
standard
we
are
assessing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
he
testifies,
but
he
testifies
to
everything
marina
said.
meaning,
he
--
when
i
used
the
word
"confession",
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
he
takes
the
stand.
he
--
or
doesn't
take
the
stand.
he
says
everything
he
said
to
the
police.
and
that
confession
that
he
was
there--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--she
called
him,
etcetera.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
was
improperly
admitted,
without
miranda
warning.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
the
tapes,
just
the
story.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
hypothetical
is
not
working
for
this
reason,
and
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
it's
hard
to
identify
a
comparable
mistake.
but
my
point
is
that
--
doesn't
the
harmfulness
of
the
error
sort
of
vary
with
the
strength
of
the
government's
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
he
had
not
run
away,
and
the
tapes
were
admitted--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--exactly.
and
what
the
defense
said
was
--
there
is
only
one
defense
here,
and
it's
the
wife's
defense
that
he
was
there
by
accident,
not
intentionally.
there
was
a
lot
of
countervailing
evidence
to
disprove
that,
but
the
question
is
could
a
reasonable
jury
have
--
might
have
or
could
have
credited
that
defense?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sure.
you
look
at
how
the
case
was
tried.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
do
it
without
the
error.
i
keep
going
back
to
this
point.
how
about
if
the
prosecutor
had
done
in
summation
the
following:
ladies
and
gentlemen,
whatever
the
wife
told
you
disbelieve
because
the
lawyer
said
he
was
guilty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
lawyer
--
the
prosecutor
got
up
at
the
end
of
trial
and
said:
disbelieve
everything
the
wife
told
you,
because
the
lawyer
said
the
defendant
was
guilty.
all
right?
i'll
go
through
all
the
other
evidence
i
have
that
might
prove
that
she
was
not
telling
the
truth,
but
the
central,
most
important
piece
of
evidence
in
this
case
about
his
guilt
is
that
the
lawyer
said
he's
guilty.
can
you
say
that
this
jury
was
uninfluenced
by
that
error?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
under
your
formulation--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--a
rational
jury
would
have
convicted
absent
the
lawyer
saying
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
dissent
pointed
out
that
she
admitted
that
before
the
tapes
were
played.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
she
was
testifying
in
the
hopes
of
getting
a
lesser
sentence
for
her
husband.
so
she
--
the
tapes
weren't
necessary
for
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
your
second--
