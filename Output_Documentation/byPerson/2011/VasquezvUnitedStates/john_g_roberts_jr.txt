chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-199,
vasquez
v.
united
states.
mr.
brindley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--stop
you
there?
i
--
where
in
the
government's
brief
do
you
see
the
statement
that
the
analysis
should
not
look
to
the
error,
should
not
include
the
error?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
exactly
is
that
in
their
brief?
that
the
--
the
question
is
whether
a
jury
would
convict
him
without
considering
the
error?
because
i
look
at
the
government's
brief
and
they
have
fairly
extensive
analysis
of
--
of
the
error,
why
they
think
it's
not
important,
why
they
--
you
know.
but
i
don't
see
them
saying
you
don't
look
at
the
error
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
exactly.
in
other
words
you
look
at
the
prejudicial
effect
of
the
erroneous
admitted
evidence
and
see
if
that
altered
the
outcome.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
say,
immediately
after
the
sentence
you
gave
us,
they
say
"looking
at
the
evidence
as
a
whole.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,--
mr.
brindley.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
going
over
the
evidence.
and
i
may
simply
be
asking
the
same
question
justice
kennedy
asked
earlier.
but
let's
say
you
have
a
situation
where
it's
the
same
thing,
and
at
the
--
you,
know,
and
improperly
admitted
evidence
has
the
defendant
saying:
"i'm
guilty.
"
and
the
evidence
is
the
same
as
all
you've
set
forth
at
pages
2
through
9,
very
complicated,
who's
driving
what,
you
know,
kind
of
car
and
where
they
are
meeting.
and
the
jury
goes
out
and
comes
back
in
two
minutes:
you
know,
the
guy
said
he
was
guilty.
is
that
a
situation
in
which
we
are
supposed
to
then
go
back,
look
at
all
the
complicated
evidence
and
see
if
a
jury
would
have
convicted?
or
can
we
with
a
fair
degree
of
confidence
say
that
the
error
is
what
led
the
jury
to
convict?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
when
you
began,
if
i'm
remembering
correctly,
you
said
there
were
two
ways
in
which
your
position
was
different
from
mr.
brindley's.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
i
understand
is
that
you
look
at
a
rational
jury--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
not
the
particular
jury.
what's
the
second?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
brindley,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
number
11-199,
vazquez
versus
united
states.
we
have
issued
a
unanimous
per
curiam
order
dismissing
the
writ
of
certiorari
as
improvidently
granted.
