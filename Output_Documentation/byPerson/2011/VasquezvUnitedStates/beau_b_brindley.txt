mr.
beau
b.
brindley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
determining
whether
an
error
affects
substantial
rights
pursuant
to
the
harmless-error
statute,
courts
should
first
begin
the
analysis
with
the
error
itself,
consider
it
in
the
context
of
the
entire
record,
determine
what
potential
impact
it
may
have,
and
then
ask
the
question:
can
the
government
prove
to
the
requisite
degree
of
certitude
--
in
this
case,
fair
assurance
--
that
the
error
did
not
substantially
impact
the
verdict
of
the
jury
that
heard
the
case?
it
is
impermissible
for
the
reviewing
court
to
merely
ask
the
question
of
whether
some
other
jury,
a
reasonable
jury
that
didn't
hear
the
error
that
this
jury
heard,
would
convict
him
and
determine
harmlessness
on
that
basis.
kotteakos--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--before
the
harmless-error
analysis,
the
question
the
court
asks
is,
what
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
a
reasonable
jury
would
convict
him
absent
the
error.
and
so
the
question
that
they
ask
doesn't
require
any
consideration
of
the
error.
and
the
conclusion
they
reach
that
he
would
be
convicted
without
any
consideration
of
the
error
also
doesn't
consider
the
error.
they
do
not
address
the
error
or
its
impact
at
all,
despite
a
robust
dissent
which
set
forth
the
extraordinary
prejudicial
possible
impact
of
this
error.
they
don't
disagree
with
the
dissent;
they
simply
don't
address
it
at
all.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
the
--
the
statements
from
counsel,
two
statements:
one,
that
everyone
was
going
to
lose
the
case,
which
was
repeated
several
times
by
government
counsel
during
the
cross-examination.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
they
were
not
specific
--
the
recordings
were
referenced,
and
they
told
them
to
look
at
the
recordings.
they
didn't
reference
that
specific
statement.
it
was
referenced
three
times
in
the
cross-examination.
when
the
witness
suggested
that
it
--
who
was
going
to
lose
the
case
only
referred
to
her
husband,
the
government
corrected
her
and
said,
no,
it
was
everyone,
and
then
they
played
the
tape
to
make
that
clear.
they
also
played
a
portion
of
a
recording
where
it
said
that
counsel
was
talking
to
mr.
vasquez
about
pleading
guilty.
now,
if
you
take
those
two
statements
together
for
their
truth,
what
they
mean
is
that
counsel
believes
he's
guilty
and
was
telling
him
he
should
plead
that
way.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
think
that's--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--i
think
that's
the
most
substantial
one.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
well--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--well,
asking
for
her
testimony
shows
that
they
were
focused
on
the
--
they
were
asking
for
a
transcript
that
would
have
contained
that
part
of
the
record.
we
don't
--
we
can't
prove,
and
we
don't
have
the
burden
--
i
think
that's
important
--
to
prove
that
she
--
they
were
focused
on
that
specific
statement.
however,
they
did
ask
for
that
transcript.
i
also
think
they
rendered
the
split
verdict
in
the
case,
which
is--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--her
testimonies,
both
on
direct
--
and
then
they
asked
for
both,
plural,
indicating
they
wanted
the
rebuttal
testimony,
which
would
have
included
these
statements.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
for
the
government
to
prove
on
this
record
to
any
degree
of
assurance
that
they
weren't
concerned
about
that
error,
an
error
that
i
think
if
they
took
these
things
for
their
truth
then
they
could
have
thought
he
essentially
confessed
to
his
lawyer.
his
lawyer
knew
he
was
guilty.
those
are
fair
inferences
if
taken
for
their
truth.
and
then
they
could
have
disregarded
all
arguments
that
were
made
on
his
behalf.
that's
a
sort
of
error
that
could
infect
the
entire
proceeding.
and
when
you
ask--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--that
is
one
of
the
important
differences.
i
think--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--i
--
well,
in
the
government's
brief,
at
some
times,
as
we
indicate
in
our
reply,
it
seems
that
they
support
a
very
similar
test
to
ours,
and
in
others
it
seems
like
they
want
to
say
that
you
can
just
look
at
a
reasonable
jury
and
how
they
would
view
the
evidence.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
do.
the--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--the
difference
is
one
of
them
was
going
to
focus
on
the
entire
record,
which
includes
the
error.
the
other
is
going
to
focus
on
the
evidence
in
the
record
without
the
error,
and
that's
important,
particularly
with
an
error
like
this,
an
error
that
could
have
a
pernicious
effect
that
could
affect
a
large,
substantial
part
of
this
evidence,
everything
the
defendant
presented.
it
clearly--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--yes.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
part
of
the
government's
brief
asserts
that
you
can
look
at
whether
a
reasonable
jury
would
convict
him
absent
the
error.
that
assessment
doesn't
require
consideration
of
the
error.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
think
there
is
a
significant
--
i
don't
have
the
exact
citation.
on
page
29,
your
honor,
it
indicates:
"although
the
court's
analysis
often
has
not
focused
exclusively
on
the
overall
strength
of
the
government's
proof,
its
decisions
demonstrate
that
a
court's
determination
of
harmlessness
can
properly
rest
on
the
conclusion
that
the
admissible
evidence
of
guilt
is
sufficiently
strong
such
that
the
prejudicial
effect
of
erroneously
admitted
evidence
can
be
deemed
not
to
have
altered
the
outcome.
"
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
if
that's
the
--
and
there's
parts
of
--
the
government's
brief,
i
think,
agrees
with
us
in
large
part
on
what
this
test
should
be.
and
as
far
as
that
goes,
i
think
the
problem
is
the
majority
below
asked
a
different
question
and
appeared
to
do
a
different
analysis.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
two
things.
first,
the
question
that
they
asked.
the
question
that
they
asked
was
whether
a
reasonable
jury
would
convict
him
absent
the
error.
there
is
no
focus
on
this
jury
that
heard
the
case
or
this
verdict.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
in
the
--
you
mean
in
the
majority
opinion?
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
it's
immediately
prior
to
the
harmless
error
analysis.
if
we
go
to
page
16a
of
the
appendix
to
our
cert
petition,
it
states
at
the
bottom
of
that
first
paragraph:
"on
appeal,
the
burden
lies
on
the
government
to
prove
that
a
reasonable
jury
would
have
reached
the
same
verdict
without
the
challenged
evidence.
"
that's
the
question
they
are
asking.
that
question
doesn't--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--i
think
the
problem
is
they
asked
that
question,
which
i
think
is
the
wrong
question.
kotteakos
says
you
can't
ask
that
question
because
you
can't
strip
the
error
from
the
whole.
that's
the
question
they
ask.
and
to
answer
that
question
you
don't
have
to
consider
the
error.
then
i
think
it's
important
they
didn't
address
the
error
at
all;
they
didn't
address
its
potential
impact.
despite
that
dissent
which
laid
out
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
prejudicial
errors
you
could
have
in
a
trial,
they
ignored
it.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
they
do
say
that.
but
then
later
on
in
that
same
paragraph
they
indicate
that:
here's
what
the
evidence
was.
and
i
think
it's
important
that
the
only
evidence
they
talk
about
is
the
government's
evidence,
and
they
talk
about
it
in
a
way
that
views
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government.
in
their
harmless-error
analysis
they
don't
address
mrs.
perez's
testimony,
and
they
--
the
more
important
thing
is
they
don't
address
the
error
at
all.
they
don't
even
disagree
with
the
dissent's
contention
that
it's
this
terribly
prejudicial
error.
instead,
they
do
what
many
of
the
courts
below
have
been
doing
when
they
do
this
guilt-based
approach
to
ask
this
question.
they
focus
on
the
government's
evidence
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government
and
then
find,
well,
he
could
be
convicted
on
that
basis
by
a
reasonable
jury.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes,
that
was
me,
judge
--
your
honor,
yes,
it
was
me.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
think
that
actually
what
they
are
talking
about
was
whether
mr.
perez's
lawyer
had
talked
to
me,
mr.
vasquez's
lawyer.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
there
is
some
discussion
between--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--there's
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
tell
exactly
what--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--well,
because
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
most
important
thing
is
what
i
have
already
said,
is
the
question
they
ask
isn't
about
the
error,
and
they
don't
address
it
at
all.
and
when
you
consider
a
dissent
with
that
robust
of
language,
the
idea
that
they
wouldn't
address
it
at
all
is
problematic.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
don't
think
that
would
be
sufficient,
because
i
think
the
important
thing
here
is
that
they
be
required
to
ask
the
right
question,
to
focus
on
this
jury
that
heard
the
case.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
and
i
think
that
the
--
by
asking
the
question
in
that
way
and
talking
only
about
a
reasonable
jury
absent
the
error,
when
you
start
saying
absent
the
error
and
you
start
looking
at
the
evidence
without
the
error,
you
are
looking
at
a
case
the
jury
didn't
hear.
and
i
think
that's
the
biggest
problem.
if
you
are
looking
at
a
case
the
jury
didn't
hear,
then
the
reviewing
court
sort
of
makes
its
own
guilt
judgment
about
a
case
they
didn't
hear.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
if
you
do
the
analysis
that
way
and
you
say
the
error
is
corrected,
you
don't
take
into
account
its
impact.
the
question
has
been
to
be
whether
it
contributed
to
the
jury's
verdict,
not
whether
the
verdict
would
be
the
same
in
another
trial.
that's
where
that
sixth
amendment
problem
that
this
court
was
worried
about
all
the
way
back
in
kotteakos
--
and
even
in
neder,
where
this
court
said
to
safeguard
the
jury's
province
we
have
to
do
an
exacting
review
of
the
entire
record
including
--
that
would
include
the
error,
obviously,
and
its
impact.
and
here
this
court
didn't
address
the
error
or
its
potential
impact,
and
i
think--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--yes,
i
am
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
the
question--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
should
be
the
formulation
of
the
test.
i
think
it
has
to
have
a
--
what
the
government
has
to
be
able
to
do
is
prove
to
the
necessary
degree
of
certitude
that
the
error
doesn't
substantially
impact
the
verdict.
and
the
reason
i--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--i
think
what
the
--
when
you
ask
the
question
about
whether
the
verdict
contributed
substantially
to
--
or,
i'm
sorry,
whether
the
error
contributed
substantially
to
the
verdict,
what
you
are
doing
is
you
have
to
then
look
at
the
entire
record
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
error's
impact.
and
when
you
do
that
you
can
make
a
determination
whether
there's
anything
in
the
record
that
would
allow
the
government
to
prove
to
the
right
degree
of
assurance
that
it
didn't.
now,
it
could
be
the
case
that
you
look
at
all
of
the
evidence
and
you
can
say:
well,
in
light
of
all
the
other
evidence,
the
error
was
cumulative
or
it
was
essentially
uncontested,
and
then
you
can
find
that
error
is
harmless,
it
couldn't
have
contributed
to
the
verdict,
and
we
know
that
to
the
right
degree
of
certitude.
i
think
the
problem
comes
in
when
you
are
talking
about
this
reasonable
jury
and
whether
they
would
convict
without
the
error,
that's
some
other
trial.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes,
absolutely,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
error
--
if
those
things
are
taken
for
their
truth,
they
serve
as
an
independent
basis
for
conviction,
believing
he's
essentially
confessed.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
two
go
hand
in
hand.
i
think
that
if
they
take
these
statements
for
their
truth,
they
could
disbelieve
her
and
the
defense
attorney
who
called
her
because
the
defense
attorney
knew
he
was
guilty
and
then
called
this
witness
to
say
otherwise.
i
think
that
would
in
that
situation
make
it
appear
as
if
she
wasn't
telling
the
truth.
and
i
think
the
important
thing
about
this
whole
analysis--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--okay.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
am
first
saying
that
the
court
committed
review
error.
but
i
think
i'm
also
saying
on
top
of
that
if
you
do
the
error
properly,
review
properly
in
this
case,
as
we've
asked
the
test
to
be
formulated,
then
what
this
case
is
going
to
come
down
to
is
really
one
question.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes,
of
course.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
yes,
absolutely.
i
think
if
you
do
the
test
appropriately
and
do
the
proper
analysis
focused
on
this
jury
and
the
potential
impact
of
the
error,
then
this
is
a
harmful
error.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
think
if
you
did
the
examination
that
way
and
didn't
consider
10
at
all,
what
you
are
saying
is
it's
possible
to
convict
on
1
through
9,
but
you
are
not
considering
the
possibility
you
could
convict
as
an
independent
basis
on
10.
and
the
government
would
have
to--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--i
don't
--
well,
if
the
error
is
the
error
in
this
case,
that's
number
10,
then
i
think
when
you
consider
the
possible
impact,
sweeping
as
it
might
be,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
on
this
record
that
the
government
can
prove
with
fair
assurance
that
that
didn't
infect
the
jury.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
--
the
formulation
you've
stated,
i
agree
with
that.
if
number
10
is
such
that
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
prove
that
it
didn't
impact
the
jury
verdict
substantially
--
and
i
don't
think
they
can
in
this
case
--
then
yes,
that's
our
argument.
and
the
one
reason
i
think
it's
most
important
in
this
case
is
because
this
case
comes
down
to
at
the
end
--
we
have
--
you
know,
essentially
it's
a
circumstantial
case.
this
isn't
like
harrington
or
schneble
or
the
cases
with
direct
evidence
where
this
court
has
found
harmless
error.
this
is
a
case
where
the
ultimate
question
is,
if
you
believe
mrs.
perez
is
credible
he
is
not
guilty;
and
if
don't
he
is.
and
in
order
to
find
harmlessness
you
have
to
have
a
reviewing
court
on
a
cold
record
making
that
credibility
determination,
something
that
this
court
has
continually
said
a
reviewing
court
is
not
in
a
position
to
do.
and
when
a
case
can
be
ground
down
to
the
point
where
it's
going
to
come
to
a
credibility
determination
about
a
witness
the
reviewing
court
did
not
see--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--because
this
--
the
reviewing
court
has
to
look
at
everything
in
the
entire
record.
that
includes
in
this
case
the
jury
note.
it
includes
in
this
case
the
split
verdict,
all
of
those
things.
and
when
you
look
at
all
of
those
things
you
can
get
insight
into
the
jury
that
heard
the
case
and
how
they
viewed
it.
you
can
also
look
at
how
a
reasonable
jury
would
view
the
case
as
heuristic
device
to
get
back
to
what
this
jury
thought.
but--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
that.
the
problem
is
the
question
asked
by
the
majority
strips
out
the
error
and
it
also
focuses
on
the
reasonable
jury
rather
than
this
jury.
and
with
that,
if
there
aren't
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
i
first
want
to
address
neder,
which
the
government
counsel
continually
referenced.
neder
talks
about
the
reasonable
jury,
but
neder
also
limits
itself
to
situations
where
the
evidence
is
uncontroverted
and
inconvertible.
i
think
because
in
those
situations
the
difference
between
the
reasonable
jury
and
this
jury
would
be
deemed
to
be
nonexistent,
because
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
error
to
have
an
impact.
secondly,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
from
justice
sotomayor's
hypothetical,
if
you
don't
consider
the
error,
then
even
that
extreme
case,
that
would
have
to
be
ignored.
and
so
i
think
the
government's
formulation,
and
the
formulation
used
by
the
appellate
court
below,
would
justify
--
would
lead
to
that
bad
conclusion.
i
also
think
that
when
you
do
that
formulation,
where
you
are
talking
about
the
reasonable
jury
and
absence
of
error,
the
reason
those
cases
come
out
different
is
because
those
courts
think
they
don't
have
to
address
the
error,
which
is
i
think
what
happened
in
the
majority
below,
why
they
didn't
address
it
despite
the
dissent.
the
other
thing
i
think
is
important
to
note
is,
the
reason
you
have
to
look
at
the
error
and
its
possible
impact
and
not
just
whether
you
could
be
convicted
on
the
other
evidence
is
because
you
say,
well,
he
could
be
convicted
on
the
other
evidence;
if
that's
all
that
you
are
saying
and
--
and
it's
not
--
on
the
--
evidence
which
could
independently
in
this
case
could
be
a
reason
to
convict,
then
i
think
you
are
making
that
guilt
determination
that
this
court
says
is
not
supposed
to
happen.
and
i
think
the
majority's
opinion
below
is
consistent
with
that
approach
and
there's
nothing
in
it
to
suggest
that's
not
exactly
what
they
did.
i
also
think
that
in
the
end,
there
was
a
mention
of
a
limiting
instruction;
a
limiting
instruction
would
have
cured
this
problem.
we
assume
juries
would
follow
it.
that
means
they
wouldn't
concluded
that
his
lawyer
thought
him
guilty
and
then
put
mrs.
perez
on
the
stand
and
concluded
she
wasn't
telling
the
truth.
what
this
error
allows,
what
if
taken
for
its
truth
a
jury
could
believe
that
he
confessed
to
his
lawyer,
they
could
disregard
everything
that
was
said
on
his
behalf.
they
could
say
we
know
that
he
is
guilty;
his
lawyers
knew
he
was
guilty;
we
can
convict
him
on
that
basis.
that's
an
error
that
can
infect
the
entirety
of
the
proceedings.
and
if
you
look
at
this
jury
and
what
they
heard,
and
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
mrs.
perez
is
credible
or
not,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
the
government
can
point
to
that
would
allow
a
reviewing
court
to
make
that
determination.
a
reviewing
court
that
didn't
see--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--i
think
you
would
point
to
that
first
statement
of
the
test
where
they
say
whether
the
reasonable
jury
would
convict
him
absent
the
error,
because
kotteakos
says
you
can't
strip
the
error
out.
this
court
has
never
overruled
kotteakos.
the
other
thing--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--this
court
has
used,
i
think,
dicta
that
has
language
of
that
sort.
but
in
those
cases,
what
the
court
does,
like
in
harrington
they
look
at
what
the
error
was;
they
put
it
in
the
context
of
the
whole
case,
and
they
can
say
the
government
could
prove
the
jury
didn't
look
at
this
to
the
right
degree
of
assurance,
because
it
was
cumulative,
because
--
there's
no
--
there's
nothing--
mr.
beau
b.
brindley
--i
think
the
reason
to
reverse
them
is
because
that
formulation
has
proven
to
lead
to
the
wrong
analysis,
in
all
of
these
lower
courts,
this
guilt-based
approach;
and
it
is
not
the
law
of
kotteakos.
this
court
has
never
overruled
kotteakos,
and
to
focus
on
it
allows
a
guilt
determination
by
a
reviewing
court
that
would
be
violative
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
kotteakos,
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
sullivan,
that
this
court
was
even
concerned
about
in
neder,
outside
the
scope
of
cases
where
the
evidence
is
uncontestable.
because
if
you
took
these
statements
as
true,
and
then
you
came
down
to
a
question
well,
is
marina
credible
or
not,
mrs.
perez,
there
is
nothing
the
government
could
do
on
this
record
to
prove
that
the
jury
would
have
found
her
credibility
differently
because
this
court
can't
figure
it
out
on
a
cold
record.
it
said
so
many
times.
it's
not
possible
to
do,
especially
in
a
case
that
is
based
on
circumstantial
evidence
like
this
one.
