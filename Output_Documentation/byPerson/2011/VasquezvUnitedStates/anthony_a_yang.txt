mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
harmless
error
inquiry,
as
this
court
explained
in
neder
and
prior
decisions,
turns
ultimately
on
one
question:
whether
a
rational
jury
--
and
this
is
a
quote
--
whether
a
rational
jury
would
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
absent
the
error.
now--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
don't
believe
our
view
is
quite
so
firm.
i
think
as
a
general
matter
our
view
is
that
indications
mid-deliberation
of
what
a
jury
might
or
some
subset
of
the
jury
might
be
considering
is
generally
very
unreliable.
and
that
in
your
case,
the
court
shouldn't
shut
its
eyes
to
that
question,
but
what
it
should
do
is
redirect
the
court
back
to
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
jury.
because
if
we
are
assuming
a
rational
jury,
there
often
is
some
correspondence;
it
should
be
an
indication
to
go
back
and
look
again.
if
the
court
were
to
conclude,
wow,
the
evidence
was
so
overwhelming,
so
overwhelming
that
no
rational
jury
would
have,
you
know,
had
a
problem
with
convicting
absent
the
error,
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
situation
that
your
hypothetical
poses
would
result.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
ultimately
the
appellate
court
should
look
back
at
what
the
jury
was
supposed
to
consider,
the
evidence
in
light
of
the
instructions.
it
should
be
a
cautionary
note,
but
ultimately
should
redirect
the
court
back
to
the
evidence.
and
i
think
that
focuses
on
again
one
of
the
two
related
legal
points
that
petitioner
made
in
argument
that
i
think
there's
real
disagreement
between
the
government
and
petitioner
on:
one,
the
inquiry
of
a
reasonable
jury
or
a
rational
jury,
which
is
the
government's
view,
versus
this
particular
jury;
and
the
related
claim
that
the
inquiry
is
how
this
influenced
the
deliberative
process,
if
it
was
like
a
factor
that
this
jury
might
have
considered
in
reaching
its
verdict--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--are
we
taking
marina's
testimony
out
now?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
okay.
if
marina's
testimony
was
not
in
and
you
had
the
evidence
here
--
now,
an
unconstitutional
confession,
of
course,
would
raise
the
bar,
right?
we're
going
to--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--if
all
you
are
asking
is
fair
assurance,
then
i
think
you
could
get
to
the
same
result
here,
because
when
you
take
marina's
testimony
out
of
the
picture,
there
was
really
no
defense
at
all.
what
the
government
had
was
a
strong
case--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--so
he
testified
to
the
substance
of
marina's
testimony,
that
he
happened
to
just
drive
there?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
right.
and
then
the
error
is
the
same
error?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the
tapes?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i'm
a
little
confused.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
because
if
he's
testifying
in
court,
the
government
is
not
putting
him
on.
he's
going
on
as
--
there
is
no
miranda
question
or
anything.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
undoubtedly.
i
think
that's
right.
now,
let--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
would
have
a
weaker
case,
and
it
would
be
--
ultimately
these
lines
that
the
court
has
to
draw
between
a
fair
assurance
or
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
are
guides
to
reasoned
judgment
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
this
is
a
reviewing
court's
judgment
based
on
the
record.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
petitioner's
view.
i
mean,
there's
two
aspects
to
this
case.
we
can
talk
about
the
fact-findings
and
the
ins
and
outs
of
that,
which
is
interesting
in
its
own
right.
but
i
think
one
of
the
key
legal
questions
for
the
court
is
what's
the
standard
that
the
court
must
apply.
and
there
is
a
real
difference
between
the
petitioners
and
the
government
here.
and
that
standard
the
petitioner
has
advocated
is
that
this
jury,
as
opposed
to
the
reasonable
jury,
and
that
looking
at
this
jury
you
must
look
at
the
thought
process
of
this
jury
to
decide
whether
the
error
might
have
had
some
influence.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
no,
but
i
think
the
position
about
this
jury
versus
a
rational
jury
in
looking
at
the
deliberative
process
is
entirely
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision
in--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
should
qualify
that.
i
didn't
intend
to
give
the
court
the
misconception
that
we
are
looking
at
this
jury.
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
a
rational
jury
would
have
convicted
absent
the
error.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
and
--
and
the
reason
that
i
believe
that
the
court
can
use
that
as
a
benchmark
to
look
back
at
the
evidence
is
it
is
some
indication
of
perhaps
what
the
evidence
should
be
saying
to
a
rational
jury.
but
the
ultimate
question
is
the
rational
jury.
and
let
me
give
you
a
few
examples
from
the
court's
case
law,
because
i
think
this
really
puts
it
beyond
dispute
that
the
real
question
is
the
question
of
a
rational
jury,
what
they
would
do
absent
the
error.
first,
in
neder
the
court
explained
that
erroneous
admissions
of
evidence
or
exclusions
of
evidence,
just
like
an
erroneous
instruction
on
an
element
of
the
offense,
or
failure
to
instruct
on
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense,
as
was
the
case
in
neder,
will
infringe
on
the
jury's
fact-finding
role
and
will
affect
the
deliberative
process
in
ways
that
are
not
readily
calculable.
the
error
in
neder
was
that
the
jury
was
instructed
not
to
consider
the
question
of
materiality,
which
was
an
essential
element
of
the
defense.
and
the
court
specifically
rejected
that
the
question
--
that
the
fact
that
this
jury
didn't
actually
make
a
finding
based
on
the
evidence
was
not
--
did
not
foreclose
harmless-error
analysis.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that's
right.
those
types
of
indications
are
entirely
unreliable.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
what
i
think
the
court
should
do
is
when
you
have
a
--
what
is
a
much
better
indication,
or
at
least
a
--
of
what
this
jury
might
have
been
doing,
you
use
that
as
a
reason
to
go
back
and
look
again
at
the
evidence.
it's
also--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
we
think
that,
again,
the
inquiry
that
needs
to
be
focused
on
is
what
a
rational
jury
would
do.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
that.
the
reason
it's
not
a
directed
verdict
is
because
you
have
a
jury
verdict.
you
have
a
jury
verdict
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
jury
has
factually
determined
that
this
defendant
is
guilty
of
the
offense
charged,
on
proper
instruction.
then
the
question
is:
what
remedy
do
you
have?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the
reason
--
this
i
think
can
be
answered
if
i
could
just
get
out
a
few
of
the
court's
cases,
because
i
think
this
shows
the
court's
rationale
here
and
shows
that
our
view
has
to
be
the
right
view.
for
instance,
in
a
series
of
cases
this
court
has
concluded
that
the
unconstitutional
admission
of
a
confession,
either
of
the
defendant
or
the
co-defendant,
can
be
harmless
when
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
such
that
a
rational
jury
would
convict
without
the
evidence.
now,
if
we
are
looking
at
what
a
jury
would
have
considered,
whether
they
were
brought
to
tears
or
whatever,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
confession
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
rational
jury
or
any
jury
is
going
to
have
that
far
in
the
forefront
of
their
minds
when
they
are
deciding
guilt
or
innocence.
but
the
question--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i'm
sorry,
i
just--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no.
you
can't--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--that's
right.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
for
instance
in
rose,
where
the
question
was
the
jury
was
told
to
presume
certain
malice
in
a
homicide:
the
fact
that
the
error
may
have
altered
the
basis
on
which
the
jury
decided
the
case
is
not
the
question;
you
look
to
the
reasonable
juror.
similarly
in
pope,
the
court
said:
the
question
does
not
turn
on
whether
the
jury
did
not,
in
fact,
have
this
error
in
mind
when
it
found
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
because--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
--
i
think
it's
a
factor
that
you
consider
again
in
directing
the
court's
look
at
really
what
the
trial
evidence
was.
i
mean
it
i
think,
belies
the
facts
of
this
case.
obviously
that's
a
hypothetical.
but
when
you
look
at
how
cases
really
develop,
prosecutors
don't
focus
on
a
fleeting,
you
know,
sentence
in
a
series
of
--
series
of
long
tapes
that
weren't
transcribed--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
think
when
you
look
at
what
happened
at
trial,
you
see
that
the
tapes
were
played
for
two
reasons:
one,
to
show
that
marina
had
bias
because
she
was
told
by
petitioner's
counsel,
the
petitioner's
counsel
who
she
thought
this,
petitioner's
counsel
would
be
able
to
make
motions
and
arguments
on
behalf
of
her
husband
at
sentencing.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
correct.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
corr
--
well,
the
tapes
certainly
were
reinforcing
of
that.
and
in
fact
when
the
government's
closing
argument
--
it
did
not
reference
anything
about
this
--
what
i
think
you
and
justice
breyer
correctly
identified
as
a
very
ambiguous
sentence
in
a
series
of
long
tapes.
remember,
these
transcripts
that
are
in
the
record
are
only
one
portion
of
the
tapes.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the
exact
lines?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
to
be
fair
i
think
you
need
to
look
at
what
is
before
and
after
it.
the
government
is
focusing
on
three
different
statements
that
are
at
issue
in
the
case.
the
first
one
is
that,
with
some
profanity,
suggesting
that
her
husband
is
not
likely
to
succeed
at
trial.
the
second
one
is
that
defense
counsel
suggested
--
that
she
said
that
defense
counsel
suggested
that
everybody
was
going
to
lose.
and
then
third,
she
thought
everybody
was
in,
again
with
profanity,
i'm
going
to
paraphrase,
a
bad
situation.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--the
reason
that
this
was
in
--
and
i
don't
--
it's
not
contested
here
--
is
because
the
argument
was
made
that
these
statements
equating
petitioner
and
perez
in
terms
of
their
level
of
guilt
or
their
likelihood
of
being
convicted
is
inconsistent
with
marina's
subsequent
testimony
that
all
of
us,
you
know,
vasquez
just
--
or
petitioner
just
showed
up
unknowingly
because
she
asked
him.
that
was
the
theory.
it's
not
contested,
and
in
fact
nothing
that
the
jury
heard
in
this
case
under
petitioner's
theory
would
be
different.
the
only
difference
would
be
a
limiting
instruction
that
would
simply
say
you
can't
take
these
statements
for
the
truth
of
the
matter.
so
nothing
that
the
jury
heard
would
have
been
different.
when
you
read
the
short
passage
in
the
context
of
these
tapes
--
and
the
tapes
again
are
not
fully
transcribed.
petitioner
asked
for
the
entire
tapes
to
come
in.
at
the
tail
end
of
the
trial,
which
--
which
was
based
on
the
government's
showing
that
was
uncontested
that
petitioner
was
at
the
scene,
he
drove
the
$23,000
there,
he
waited
with
perez
and
cruz
while
the
informant
was
coming
back,
he
was
there
when
the
call
was
made
to
the
informant
that
said
they
had
the
money.
now,
there
is
some
dispute
of
whether
he
said
that,
but
certainly
he
was
there
when
that
call
was
made
because
that
is
what
triggered
the
raid.
all
of
that
was
basically
undisputed.
you
have
got
all
these
calls
that
tie
petitioner
to
perez
--
to
perez,
27
calls--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
think
the
former,
but
let
me
explain.
and
again,
i'm
going
to
go
back
to
neder,
if
i
may,
for
a
second.
in
neder,
the
jury
never
found
an
element
of
the
offense.
never
did.
there's
no
question
that
the
jury's
verdict
was
affected
by
the
failure
to
instruct.
in
fact,
it
was
not
just
a
failure
to
instruct.
the
district
court
told
the
jury
this
is
not
for
them
to
consider.
and--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
but
if
we're
--
again,
if
we're
focusing
on
the
legal
dispute
between
us
and
the
other
side
about
whether
we're
looking
at
this
jury
or
what
a
rational
jury
would
do
when
you
excise--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
and--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--the
answer
is
that
in
a
case
where
the
jury,
where
you
have
some
very
provocative
evidence,
but
there's
also
a
very
strong
case
that
exists
--
it
may
defend
--
depend
on
the
level
of
certainty
that
you
need
to
get
to,
whether
it's
fair
assurance
or
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
even
in
those
cases,
you
can
--
the
court
looks
at
the
evidence
as
a
whole
and
says
that
--
there
was
so
much
evidence
before
this
stuff
came
in,
this
bad
--
this
error
came
in,
that
a
rational
jury
would
have
gotten
to
the
same
result
and
it
would
have
convicted.
then--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
think
so.
but
let
me
give
you
an
example.
it's
not,
again,
what
a
--
what
this
particular
jury
was
doing.
because
we
know,
for
instance,
for
neder
or
in
the
confession
cases,
the
jury
hears
a
confession,
an
unconstitutionally
obtained
confession
--
unconstitutionally
admitted,
from
the
defendant.
that
is
going
to
be
--
right
there.
you
know?
a
jury
--
a
juror
could
say,
let's
go
home,
we
have
a
confession.
it's
out
of
his
own
mouth.
there's
very
little
else
to
debate.
but
when
the
evidence
is
beyond
that
confession,
so
overwhelming
that
no
rational
jury
would
have
gotten
to
a
different
result
and
you
can
say
that
with
a
fair
assurance,
or
if
there's
a
constitutional
error
that
would
be
with
a
confession
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
court
says
that
this
is
harmless.
and
the
reason
that
the
court's
taking
that
inquiry
is
because
it
recognized
--
the
court's
long
recognized
that
no
trial
is
perfect,
that
there
are
very
significant
costs
of
retrial.
and
so
the--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--this
--
this
--
that
argument
was
specifically
rejected
by
this
court
in
neder.
the
same
question
came
up,
and
in
fact,
neder
is
a
much
--
more
difficult
case
for
the
government
than
this,
because
at
least
in
neder,
the
defendant
had
the
argument
that
this
jury
could
--
did
not
find
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt
because
it
was
never
instructed
to
find
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i'm
--
i
don't
want
to
resist
this
too
much,
because
i
think
we're
fighting
about
things
at
the
very
extreme.
most
of
the
times
that
we're
talking
about
these
purported
indications
from
the
jury,
it's
entirely
ambiguous.
and
the
--
so
there
may
be
well
be
extreme
examples.
and
i
think
those
would
rightfully
influence
a
court's
consideration
in
a
case.
but
again,
when
you
have
harmless
error
cases
in
which
we
know
for
a
certainty,
as
in
neder,
that
the
jury
did
not
find
an
element
of
the
offense,
the
inquiry
has
to
be
--
it
has
to
be
on
what
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
--
this
is
i
believe
on
pages
19
of
our
brief
--
that
the
focus
of
the
harmless-error
inquiry
is
bringing
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
primary
purpose
of
a
trial
is
the
factual
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
it's
related.
his
focus
on
the
particular
--
this
jury
i
believe
is
seeing
whether
there's
some
influence
on
the
process
--
deliberative
process
even
if
the
outcome
would
have
been
the
same
absent
the
error.
so
he's
kind
of
trying
to
get
into
the
minds
of
the
jury.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
that.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
we
don't
think
that
there
is
this
deep
--
there
are
some
disagreements
or
some
things
we
disagree
about
what
did
a
court
of
appeals
do
in
particular
cases.
but
with
respect
to
this
formulation
of
the
--
i
think
petitioner
calls
it
the
"guilt-focused
versus
effect-of-the-error-focused
approaches",
the
scholarship,
i
think
he
relies
principally
on
judge
edwards'
opinion
about
harmless
error.
that
came
out
in
1995,
when
it
was
already
swimming
against
--
upstream
against
this
court's
harmless-error
decisions.
but
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
sullivan
decision,
which
was
admittedly
a
structural-error
case,
but
there
was
language
in
sullivan
which
suggested
that
you
need
to
look
at
what
this
particular
jury
was
going
to
do.
then
you
have
neder
and
--
i
can't
pronounce
this
very
well
--
but
recueno.
it's
the
--
the
apprendi
application
of
neder,
which
specifically
reject
this
kind
of
broad
approach
--
logic
in
sullivan
as
being
inconsistent
with
the
court's
harmless
error
cases.
now--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--yes.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no.
the
court,
even
in
--
i
think
most
recently,
the
court
explained
in
shinseki,
talking
about
kotteakos,
that
you
don't
use
these
kind
of
presumptions
or
rigid
rules.
and
the
reason
that
you
do
this
--
you're
kind
of
looking
from
the
perspective
of
a
reasonable
jury.
the
jury
has
in
fact
found
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
then
the
question
is,
are
you
setting
aside
that
verdict
because
--
do
you
think
that
this
error
was
the
thing
that
tipped
the
scales
from
not
guilty
to
guilty?
and
so
taking
a
look
at
the
evidence,
kind
of
all
presumptions
favoring
one
side
or
the
other,
is
not
how
this
court
has
conducted--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--the
government
has
to
show,
as
--
this
is
the
formulation
in
neder,
and
which
the
court
has
said
in
neder
is
the
same
thing
that
applied
in
erroneous
admissions
or
exclusions
of
evidence;
that
a
rational
jury
would
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
absent
the
error,
and
that
involves
the
three
core
elements
we
explained
in
our
brief.
and
then
the
court
takes
into--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--in
some
cases
you
can
do
that,
where
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
--
if
i
--
if
i
may
finish.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
briefly.
in
some
cases,
you
might
do
that.
in
other
cases
where
it's
closer,
the
evidence
is
not
so
strong,
you
look
to
--
look
at
the
error
to
see
if
that
error
was
going
to
be
a
dispositive
think
in
getting
to
guilt.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
yes.
it's
--
in
the
position
of
this
jury,
based
on
the
evidence
presented
to
the
jury,
correct.
