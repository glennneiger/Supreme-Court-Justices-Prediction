justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
are
agreeing
with
the
dissenting
judge,
who
i
think
did
say
this
error
is
harmful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
you
are
not
saying
that
it's
just
that
they
didn't
use
the
right
formula,
but
you
would
say,
given
what
occurred
here,
the
importance
of
this
witness,
that
--
that
this
was
a
harmful
error?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
--
i
thought
your
main
point,
as
you
said
"this
jury"
rather
than
a
hypothetical
jury,
i
thought
your
main
point
is
that
what's
wrong
is
to
say,
strip
out
the
infected
testimony,
take
that
out,
look
at
the
rest
of
the
record
and
if
the
rest
of
the
record
warrants
conviction
no
harmless
error.
i
thought
that
what
you
were
saying
is
that
the
basic
mistake
is
what
are
they
looking
to,
are
they
looking
to
all
of
the
evidence,
or
are
they
just
asking
the
question,
let's
take
out
the
tainted
evidence
and
see
if
there's
enough
to
convict?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
yang--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--going
back
then
to
your
position
in
your
brief
where
you
said
that
you
would
not
include
in
the
harmless
error
calculus
that
the
jury
requested
to
hear
marina's
testimony
again,
the
length
of
their
deliberations,
the
divided
verdict.
you
said
in
your
brief
at
pages
32
to
35
that
you
would
not
include
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
you
answered
justice
kagan
that
you
could
take
them
into
account,
the
court
could
take
them
into
account
but
cautiously,
not
give
them
--
not
give
them
undue
weight.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
--
you
would
take
into
account
that
the
prosecution
apparently
thought
this
was
important,
so
important.
the
trial
was
over.
the
prosecutor
said:
judge,
i'd
like
to
come
back
so
these
tapes
can
be
introduced.
the
--
we
have
the
witness
testifying
that
defendant
was
there
by
chance;
he
was
not
part
of
the
scheme.
we
have
no
direct
evidence,
because
cruz
never
spoke
to
this
defendant,
to
vasquez.
he's
at
the
scene,
we
know
that.
and
an
explanation,
an
innocent
explanation,
is
given
why
he's
at
the
scene.
and
then
the
government
comes
back
after
everything
is
done,
and
says:
we
want
the
jury
--
we
want
these
tapes
to
be
before
the
jury.
isn't
that
--
don't
we
take
into
account
that
the
government
itself
thought
this
was
very
important?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
point
to
you
is
it
wasn't
fleeting.
if
the
government
says:
we
want
to
extend
the
trial
so
that
we
can
play
these
tapes,
all
of
them,
and
they
contain
not
just
the
one
statement,
there's
the
one
statement
that
the
trial
will
be
bad,
a
trial
will
be
bad
for
all
of
them,
and
they
ought
to
--
so
they
should
take
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
was
the
line
that
the
government,
the
prosecutor,
repeated
three
times
while
she
was
on
of
the
stand,
the
exact
lines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
the
government
thought
it
was
important
for
the
jury
to
hear
it,
because
they
said
it
three
times.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
--
you
are
essentially
saying,
as
i
understand
you,
that
--
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
directed
verdict
in
a
criminal
case,
if
the
judge
would
say,
you
know,
i
will
direct
a
verdict
here
because
there's
only
one
way
a
rational
--
rational
jury
could
come
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
agree
--
you
do
agree
that
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
error
is
harmless?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government's
burden.
and
you
also
agree
that
we
--
we
should
look
at
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
defendant
in
making--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
what
does
it
mean
that
the
government
has
the
burden?
what
does
the
government
have
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
absent
error.
so
that
means
--
wait.
you
look
at
just
the
evidence
that's
not
tainted?
