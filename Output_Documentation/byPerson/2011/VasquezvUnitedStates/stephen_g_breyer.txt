justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
read
the
whole
thing.
i
--
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand.
and
looking
at
the
transcript
on
page
769,
am
i
right?
i
want
to
get
my
own
understanding
right.
at
that
moment
your
client's
lawyer,
who
they
call
"beau"
--
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
all
right.
your
client's
lawyer,
namely
you--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--has
not
yet
seen
the
client,
is
that
right?
they
think
he
hasn't
seen
the
client
yet.
they
say
somewhere
he
hasn't
even
talked
to
him
yet
or
something;
he
hasn't
even
talked
to
beau.
he
hasn't
seen
his
lawyer
yet.
they
say
that
two
paragraphs
earlier.
so
is
that
right,
basically,
that
they
think
that,
anyway?
you
see
at
the
top
of
the
page,
about
six
lines
down,
he
hasn't
even
talked
to
the
lawyer
yet,
he
hasn't
even
talked
to
beau.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
they're
talking
about
the
lawyer.
all
right.
and
what
you
are
trying
to
do,
as
far
as
i
can
read
this,
is
they
think
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
you
want
perez
to
plead
guilty.
is
that
the
fair
thrust
of
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
it
means?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
it's
hard
to
tell
what
they
are
talking
about,
i
grant
you
that.
i
thought
they
were
talking
about
trying
--
that
you
thought
it
would
be
better
if
everybody
got
some
kind
of
agreement
worked
out.
and
then
she
says,
perez's
wife:
"how
can
i
not
worry"?
he
says:
"i
don't
understand
what's
going
on.
"
--which
is
fair
comment.
"but
it's
not
the
way,
beau.
"
"he's
putting
it
two
different
ways.
"
"if
he
didn't
explain
to
you
the
way,
then,
either
--
then
it's
a
different
story.
"
"if
you
don't
ask
him--
"
then
she
says:
"yes,
he's
saying
that
everybody's
going
to
lose.
"
"he's
saying
that,
whatever
he
wants
to
say.
"
"i
don't
believe
it.
"
by
the
time
i
got
through
reading
that,
i
wasn't
certain
what
they
were
talking
about,
and
i
thought
it
sounded
like
they
were
talking
about:
let's
all
make
an
agreement
or
everybody's
going
to
lose.
and
--
that
--
i
could
see
that
you
could
say
that's
prejudicial.
i
could
also
see
that
the
government
could
say
it
isn't
prejudicial.
and
it's
--
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
read
their
opinion
as
thinking
they
were
really
not
thinking
about
that
error.
i
mean
that
was
--
or
not
an
error.
i
mean,
of
course
they
would
be
thinking
about
that;
that
was
the
issue.
and
it
says
--
i
read
the
opinion,
they
said,
well,
there's
so
much
other
evidence
in
the
case,
and
in
our
opinion
this
is
weak
enough
that
it
didn't
--
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference.
and
--
and
if
you
didn't,
say,
take
it
for
the
truth.
and
the
other,
dissenting
judge,
common,
thinking:
no,
i
don't
know;
you
know,
it's
pretty
hard
to
understand
what
it
means,
but
there
is
an
implication
there
the
lawyer
thinks
he's
guilty
of
some
kind,
and
in
context
that
might
have
made
a
difference.
so
he
comes
to
a
different
conclusion.
that's
what
i
saw
going
on.
and
i
didn't
see
some
big
war
of
standards.
i
just
saw
judges
disagreeing
about
a
fairly
tough
question
in
an
individual
case.
so
what
can
you
say
to
make
me
change
my
mind
and
think
this
is
a
war
of
standards
that
we
ought
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
so
would
it
satisfy
you
in
your
opinion
if
we
said
we
aren't
finding
your
opinion
totally
clear?
and
luckily
people
don't
have
the
right
to
send
cases
back
to
us
on
that
basis,
but
we
have
the
right
to
send
cases
back
to
you
on
that
basis.
and
therefore
we
would
like
you
to
clarify
whether
you
do
or
did
or
did
not
take
in
the
actual
transcript
page
there,
when
you
reached
your
conclusion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
back
to
justice--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
would
like
very
much
to
know
what
your
answer
is
to
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
and
the
chief
justice's.
as
i
understand
those
hypotheticals,
they're
trying
to
imagine
a
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
a
particular
piece
of
improperly
admitted
evidence
--
we
know
from
how
the
jury
reacted,
or
the
kind
of
evidence
--
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
could
really
make
a
difference.
i
mean,
they
were
in
tears,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
in
my
reading
of
this,
which
i
once
had
to
read
about
100
harmless
error
cases,
and
it
seemed
to
me
--
and
you
can
confirm
or
deny
this
--
that
in
cases
like
that,
the
judge
who
knows
this
is
a
tough
case
when
the
jury's
feeling
this
way,
asks
himself
or
herself
the
question,
"could
this
illegally
admitted
evidence
make
a
difference?
"
"could
it
have
made
a
difference
in
this
case?
"
"could
it
have?
"
and
the
answer
is
going
to
be
no
where
that
judge
thinks
a
reasonable
jury
would
not
have
thought
it
made
a
critical
difference.
and
that's
just
putting
the
same
thing
i
think
slightly
differently.
but
the
answer
in
justice
kennedy's
case
would
be
a
judge
just
isn't
going
to
think
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
rationality.
if
the
jury's
in
tears,
they're
going
to
think
it's
a
close
case.
and
therefore,
if
in
fact
this
could
have
made
a
difference,
the
judge
says,
yes,
it's
not
harmless.
and
if
the
judge
thinks
no,
it
couldn't
have
made
a
difference
to
any
rational
person,
he's
going
to
say
harmless.
period.
now,
that
was
my
impression
reading
those
cases.
and
i
felt
that
those
hypotheticals
were
getting
at
that.
and
--
use
them.
answer
them
rather
than
me,
because
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
[laughter]
