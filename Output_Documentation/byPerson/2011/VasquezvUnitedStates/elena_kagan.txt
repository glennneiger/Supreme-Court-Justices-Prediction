justice
elena
kagan
what
would
you
point
out
in
the
majority
opinion
below
that
suggests
that
they
did
an
analysis
that
didn't
look
at
the
error
and
its
possible
prejudicial
effect?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
brindley,
i
think
one
difficulty
--
and
this
is
really
repeating
justice
alito's
question,
but
it
seems
that
you
are
parsing
things
pretty
closely.
if
i
ask
the
question
whether
an
error
altered
the
verdict,
it
seems
to
me
i
am
asking
pretty
much
the
same
question
as
whether
without
that
verdict
the
--
whether
without
that
error,
the
verdict
would
be
the
same.
that
seems
like
just
two
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing.
now,
if
what
you're
saying
is
put
aside
that
formulation,
there
are
lots
of
courts
that
are
doing
something
wrong,
which
is
that
they
are
not
looking
at
the
error
and
its
possible
prejudicial
effect
at
all,
then
i
understand
the
argument;
but
then
i
ask
the
question,
well,
is
that
what
this
court
did?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
yang,
that
does
raise
the
question
that
i
think
most
separates
you
and
mr.
brindley,
and
it's
the
question
that
justice
alito
suggested.
so
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
let's
say
that
this
jury
was
not
out
for
eight
hours,
but
was
out
for
eight
days.
and
on
the
seventh
day
a
note
came
from
the
jury,
and
the
note
said:
we
really
think
that
these
tape
recordings
are
extremely
important,
but
we're
--
we're
having
a
dispute
about
how
important
they
are,
and
we
would
like
to
listen
to
them
again.
and
they
do
that,
and
then
they
come
back
with
this
compromise
verdict.
now,
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
we
cannot
look
at
any
of
that.
essentially,
the
best
proof
that's
available
to
us
about
whether
the
error
in
fact
affected
this
jury's
decision,
you
would
have
a
court
close
its
eyes
to.
and
i
guess
--
why
would
that
be?
justice
elena
kagan
so
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
to
me.
you
are
saying
to
me:
no,
we
didn't
mean
to
say
that
that
was
irrelevant;
we
just
mean
to
say
that
an
appellate
court
should
be
cautious
about
it
and
look
at
that
kind
of
evidence
in
the
--
in
light
of
everything
else
that
happened
at
the
trial.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
just
told
me
it
wasn't,
mr.
yang.
because
--
because
i
think
that
the
reason
why
this
jury
versus
a
reasonable
jury
is
important
is
whether
you
are
going
to
take
into
account
what
you
know
about
what
this
jury
did:
how
long
it
stayed
out,
what
notes
it
wrote
to
the
court,
what
eventual
verdict
it
reached.
and
you
just
suggested
to
me
that
that
was
fair
game
to
consider
in
this
analysis,
although
one
should
be
cautious
about
doing
it.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
a
rational
jury
is
not
the
jury
that
i
said
stayed
out
for
8
days
and
sent
back
a
note
on
the
seventh
day.
that's
this
jury.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
starting
to
look,
mr.
yang,
very
much
like
a
directed
verdict
for
the
government
on
the
part
of
the
judge.
because
you
are
so
abstracting
it
from
this
case
and
this
jury
and
what
this
jury's
reactions
to
everything
that
happened
was
that,
you
know,
why
not
just
go
to
the
directed
verdict?
justice
elena
kagan
you
do
have
a
jury
--
excuse
me.
you
do
have
a
jury
verdict,
but
you
are
giving
us
a
formulation
of
the
test
that
essentially
pretends
that
the
jury
is
not
there,
and
that
we
know
nothing
about
how
it
reacted
to
various
things.
justice
elena
kagan
but
critical
to
the
court's
view
in
that
case
was
that
the
--
the
defendant
could
not
have
contested
that
element.
justice
elena
kagan
and
you
would
need--
justice
elena
kagan
--can
i
ask
you
a
different
question,
mr.
yang,
which
is,
you
know,
this
difference
in
the
formulation
of
the
test
--
which
i
find
it
hard
to
wrap
my
mind
around,
but
and
--
it
strikes
me
that
there's
two
different
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing.
but
i'm
told
that
there's
a
fair
bit
of
scholarship
out
there
which
suggests
that
courts
that
use
one
formulation
tend
to
come
out
one
way,
and
courts
that
use
the
other
formulation
tend
to
come
out
the
other
way.
and
i'm
just
wondering
what
your
view
of
that
is,
that
somehow,
one
formulation
seems
to
put
the
emphasis
on
the
entire
case.
whereas
the
other
formulation
seems
to
put
the
emphasis
on
only
the
government's
evidence,
and
that
that
makes
a
difference
in
the
end.
