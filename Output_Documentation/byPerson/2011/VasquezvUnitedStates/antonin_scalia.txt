are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
it
--
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
verdict
would
have
been
the
same
by
this
jury
if
the
error
had
not
been
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
test
is
whether
it
contributed
to
the
verdict,
and
if
it
did
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
same
verdict
would
have
been
pronounced
absent
that
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
what
is
harmless
error?
every
error
is
harmful.
every
error
that
is
there
contributes
to
the
verdict.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
harmless
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
does
that
mean?
to
say
that
it
doesn't
substantially
impact
the
verdict
means
the
verdict
would
have
been
the
same
despite
this
evidence.
but
you
are
saying
no,
that's
not
the
test;
you
have
to
ask
whether
it
contributed
to
the
verdict.
the
government
says:
well,
it
did,
but
the
verdict
would
have
been
the
same
anyway.
that's
what
harmless
error
is,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
any
of
this
have
to
deal
with
her
credibility?
did
the
dissent
say
that
the
way
this
affected
the
jury
was
that
it
rendered
her
less
credible?
i
thought
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
dissent
just
said:
it's
bad
to
tell
the
jury
that
even
the
defendant
thought
he
was
guilty,
or
even
the
defendant's
lawyer
thought
he
was
going
to
lose.
