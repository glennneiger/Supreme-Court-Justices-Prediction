justice

bader

why
is
per
se
rule
necessarily
what
is
being
argued
here?
for
one
thing,
he
had
no
choice
but
to
go
with
the
police,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
different
from
some
cases
where
the
prisoner
initiates
the
conversation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
they
took
him
from
his
cell,
he
was
under
compulsion
to
leave
with
them
and
interrogated
during
the
hours
when
prisoners
are
ordinarily
sleeping?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
were
and
the
police
officer
said,
come
along
with
us,
okay,
he
could
say,
no.
but
here
he
didn't
have
that
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
--
is
the
time
relevant
that
this
was
done?
they
took
him
away
at
7:00
in
the
evening
and
kept
him
for
7
hours.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
didn't
do
him
any
good,
because
he
couldn't
get
back
to
his
cell
without
being
escorted
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
"in
custody"
point
in
mathis.
it
was
assumed
that
they
were
in
custody,
and
the
issue
was
whether
he
could
be
questioned
about
a
crime
other
than
the
one
for
which
he
was
being
held.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
going
back
to
miranda
itself,
which
says
in
custody
or
otherwise
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
action
in
any
significant
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
and
i
think
you've
repeated
the
phrase
from
--
from
miranda
that
what
the
--
what
it
was
aiming
at
was
incommunicado
interrogation
of
an
individual
in
a
police-dominated
atmosphere.
the
question
is
whether
the
court
has
modified
what
miranda
said
in
--
in
that
regard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court,
this
court,
because
this
court
now
seems
to
assume
that
it
must
be
in
custody
and
not
--
not
otherwise
deprived
of
action,
that
being
in
custody
is
essential.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
think
you
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
their
question
--
the
question
is,
is
the
person
entitled
to
miranda
warnings?
and
the
argument
has
been
that
they're
not
entitled
to
miranda
warnings
unless
you
are
in
custody.
they
say:
we
want
to
have
a
per
se
rule
for
"in
custody",
that
is,
if
you
are
taken
out
of
your
cell
and
put
in
another
place
under
police
guard
and
questioned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
indication
that
he
told
them
--
that
he
told
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--officers
that
he
needed
medication.
