justice

a.
alito,

what
is
the
rule
that
you
want
us
to
adopt?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
everybody
in
prison
is
in
custody
at
all
times.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
you
want
to
question
anybody
in
prison
about
anything,
you
have
to
give
them
miranda
warnings.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
sense
does
that
make?
why
is
one
more
in
custody
depending
on
the
subject
that
the
police
want
to
question
the
person
about?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
whenever
--
so
whenever
a
prisoner
is
isolated
and
questioned
about
a
crime,
no
matter
where
it
occurs,
the
miranda
warning
has
to
be
given?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
about
a
possible
crime?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
prisoner
is
stabbed
in
the
yard,
and
there
are
50
prisoners
in
the
yard
at
the
time
and
the
prison
guards
want
to
question
everybody
to
see
what
they
saw,
they
all
have
to
be
given
miranda
warnings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it's
a
witness
in
the
outside
world,
the
witness
is
unlikely
to
be
in
custody.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
does.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
these
--
all
these
people
in
your
view
are
in
custody,
and
they
all
are
being
asked
questions
that
may
incriminate
them--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
they
don't
have
to
be
given
miranda
warnings
unless
they
are
suspects.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
will
that
not
occur?
in
my
hypothetical,
the
stabbing
in
the
yard,
you
mean
you
think
the
guards
are
going
to
say,
"okay,
all
you
guys
stay
here,
now
we're
all
--
we're
going
to
question
each
of
you
individually
with
everybody
else,
the
other
prisoners
present?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
then
they
will
be
isolated.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
they
all
will
get
miranda
warnings.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
can
you
this?
suppose
you
have
this
situation:
the
police
officers
go
to
a
prison.
the
--
a
prisoner
is
brought
to
an
interview
room,
and
the
police
officers
are
there
with
that
prisoner
in
the
interview
room.
they
say
to
him:
we
are
investigating
allegations
that
you
committed
child
abuse.
now,
you
are
free
to
leave
if
you
want
to,
and
we
will
see
that
you
go
back
to
your
cell
right
away.
he
says,
no,
no,
i
want
to
explain
this;
i
welcome
this
opportunity
to
speak
to
you.
do
they
have
to
give
him
miranda
warnings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
they
said:
we
would
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it;
but
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
us;
you
are
free
to
go.
and
he
says
immediately:
no,
no,
there
is
a
misunderstanding
here;
i
want
to
explain
this;
i
am
glad
you
came
and
asked
me
about
this;
i
don't
want
to
go
back
to
my
cell.
and
you
say
that's
coercive.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
which
comes
to
us
from
the
sixth
circuit
concerns
the
test
for
determining
whether
a
prisoner
is
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
miranda
rule.
respondent
fields
was
serving
a
sentence
in
the
michigan
jail
when
he
was
taken
from
his
cell
to
a
conference
room
and
questioned
about
the
sexual
abuse
of
a
12-year-old
boy.
he
was
not
given
miranda
warnings
or
advised
that
he
did
not
have
to
speak
with
the
interviewing
deputies,
but
he
was
told
more
than
once
that
he
was
free
to
leave
and
return
to
his
cell.
fields
confessed
and
he
was
later
charged
with
criminal
sexual
conduct
and
convicted.
the
state
courts
rejected
fields'
contention
that
his
confession
should
have
been
suppressed
because
he
was
subjected
to
custodial
interrogation
without
a
miranda
warning,
but
the
federal
district
court
granted
habeas
relief
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
our
precedents
clearly
establish
that
a
prisoner
is
always
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
miranda
when
he
is
removed
from
general
prison
population
and
questioned
about
conduct
that
occurred
outside
the
prison.
our
decisions,
however,
do
not
clearly
establish
such
a
categorical
rule
and
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
this
rule
provides
a
permissible
basis
for
federal
habeas
relief
under
the
relevant
provision
of
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1986.
indeed,
the
rule
applied
by
the
sixth
circuit
does
not
represent
a
correct
interpretation
of
our
miranda
case
law.
under
miranda,
custody
is
a
term
of
art,
not
all
restraints
on
freedom
of
movement
amount
to
miranda
custody
and
imprisonment
alone
is
not
enough
to
create
a
custodial
situation
for
miranda
purposes.
although
taking
a
prisoner
aside
for
questioning
may
necessitate
some
additional
limitations
on
the
prisoner's
freedom
of
movement,
it
does
not
necessarily
convert
a
noncustodial
situation
into
miranda
custody
and
neither
does
questioning
a
prisoner
about
criminal
activity
that
took
place
outside
the
prison
have
a
greater
potential
for
coercion
than
questioning
under
otherwise
identical
circumstances
about
criminal
activity
that
took
place
within
prison
walls.
the
record
in
this
case
reveals
that
respondent
was
not
taken
into
custody
for
miranda
purposes.
for
these
reasons
and
others
stated
in
our
opinion,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
breyer
and
justice
sotomayor
have
joined.
