chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-680,
howes
v.
fields.
mr.
bursch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
way
do
you
think
that
factor
cuts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
wonder
why
you
just
agreed
that
the
7
hours
would
be
a
pertinent
circumstance.
it
strikes
me
that
that
would
be
a
pertinent
circumstance
on
overall
voluntariness,
perhaps,
but
once
you
are
told
you
can
leave
whenever
you
want,
i
don't
see
why
it
matters
at
all
how
long
he
is
kept
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
is
not
a
relevant
circumstance
on
the
custody
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
now
ms.
jacobs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
justice
ginsburg
is
quite
right.
that
--
that
was
not
the
issue
in
mathis.
the
argument
in
mathis
was:
we're
questioning
him
about
something
else,
so
we
don't
have
to
give
him
miranda
warnings.
and
that's
the
question
that
the
court
decided.
i
don't
think
it
had
any
discussion
about
whether
--
there
was
certainly
not
the
argument
of
whether
he
was
in
custody
or
not.
the
argument
was
this
is
a
different
crime,
so
we
don't
have
to
give
you
miranda,
and
the
court
rejected
that.
so
how
does
that
clearly
establish
the
law
on
which
the
court
relied
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know,
where
exactly
in
mathis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
only
about
five
pages
long.
can
you
show
me
where
they
have
that
discussion
about
custody,
as
opposed
to
a
discussion
about
what
crime
is
being
discussed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
it's
implied.
inferred.
how--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
that
clearly
established
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
this
is
not
--
what
you
want
to
derive
from
mathis
is
not
part
of
the
holding
of
mathis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
extension.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
mine
from
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
think
that
your
argument
or
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
implicit
in
or
an
extension
of
mathis?
mathis
says
you
don't
--
you're
--
you
are
not
free
of
miranda
just
because
it's
a
different
crime.
how
does
that
answer
the
issue
before
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
what
we
have
been
arguing
about
is
not
the
nexus
issue,
but
instead
whether
in
light
of
the
circumstances
or
under
an
absolute
rule
there
is
custody.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
is
the
clearly
established
law
set
forth
in
our
cases
that
answers
that
latter
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
--
since
we
are
talking
about
the
sixth
circuit
decision,
what
it
says
is,
this
is
on
page
10
a,
"the
central
holding
of
mathis
is
that
a
miranda
warning
is
required
whenever
an
incarcerated
individual
is
isolated
from
the
general
prison
population
and
interrogated,
i.e.,
questioned
in
a
manner
likely
to
lead
self-incrimination
about
conduct
occurring
outside
of
the
prison.
"
is
that
a
correct
description
of
mathis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
mathis
rejected
the
argument
that
it
depends
on
whether
the
crime
is
the
one
you
are
in
prison
for
or
something
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
first
part,
miranda
warning
is
required
whenever
an
incarcerated
individual
is
isolated
from
the
general
prison
population,
okay?
and
interrogated,
i.e.,
questioned
or
whatever.
now
does
that
address
all
of
the
issues?
is
that
--
where
in
mathis
is
the
discussion
about
whenever
an
incarcerated
individual
is
isolated
from
the
general
prison
population?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
where
in
mathis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
argument
were
that
miranda
was
not
required
because
this
concerns
a
different
crime
than
what
you
are
in
prison
for
here.
i
understand
the
idea
that
under
aedpa
that
mathis
is
clearly
established
law.
the
issue
here,
however,
as
the
sixth
circuit
put
it
is
a
warning
is
required
whenever
an
incarcerated
individual
is
isolated
from
the
general
prison
population.
and
i
jut
don't
see
that
anywhere
in
mathis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
the
best
you
can
say,
not
that
mathis
found
but
perhaps
that
mathis
apparently
assumed
that
he
was
in
custody,
because
there
is
no
discussion
of
it?
there
is
no
discussion
of
the
custody--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
they
give
a
factual
recital,
he
was
in
his
cell
and
all
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
dicta?
dicta
is
something
that
is
said
that
is
not
necessarily
to
the
holding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
anything
that
is
said
about
it
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
mentioned
several
times,
when
we
were
talking
about
mathis,
that,
you
know,
they
mentioned
he
was
in
--
in
a
cell,
right?
i've
just
been
skimming
it
quickly.
i
don't
see
where
that's
mentioned.
do
you
know
offhand?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
did,
too.
and
--
and
i
--
well,
i'll
look
at
it
again.
i'm
sure
it's
--
i'm
sure
it's
there--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--all
i
see
is
noting
that
he
was
in
prison
serving
a
state
sentence,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
bursch,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-680,
howes
verus
fields.
