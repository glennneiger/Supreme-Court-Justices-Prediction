justice
elena
kagan
general,
when
you
say
that,
i
took
sometimes
your
brief
and
the
u.s.
government's
brief
to
be
saying
something
more,
which
is
that
it's
not
all
the
circumstances;
it's
all
the
circumstances
minus
circumstances
that
are
attendant
upon
normal
prison
living.
so
are
you
still
arguing
that,
or
are
you
really
arguing
an
all-the-circumstances
test?
justice
elena
kagan
so
a
court
can
still
think,
when
it's
doing
an
all-the-circumstances
inquiry,
it
can
still
factor
in
something
like,
you
know,
it
just
--
it
was
going
to
take
him
an
hour
to
get
back
to
his
cell?
that's
still
something
that
the
court
can
consider
along
with
everything
else.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
ask
you
a
different
sort
of
question,
ms.
anders.
putting
aside
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
here,
if
you
look
back
at
the
initial
state
court
opinion,
do
you
read
the
state
court
--
do
you
think
the
state
court
is
fairly
read,
could
the
sixth
circuit
have
fairly
read
it,
as
establishing
its
own
per
se
rule,
which
was
the
per
se
rule
that
we
rejected
in
mathis?
in
other
words,
that
the
state
supreme
court
required
some
kind
of
nexus
between
the
prison
custody
and
the
interrogation?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
we've
always
insisted
upon
in
miranda
cases?
justice
elena
kagan
and
where
do
you
get
this
focus
on
isolation
from?
i
mean,
it's
never
mentioned
in
mathis.
you
said
let's
go
back
to
mathis,
but
that's
not
a
part
of
mathis,
is
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
do
you
agree--
justice
elena
kagan
--ms.
jacobs,
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
--
it
seems
to
be
me
that
shatzer
must
--
excuse
me,
mathis
must
have
found
that
mr.
mathis
--
the
court
in
mathis
must
have
found
that
mr.
mathis
was
in
custody.
that
would
be
a
fair
inference
for
mathis?
justice
elena
kagan
but
we
have
no
idea
why
the
court
thought
that
mr.
mathis
was
in
custody.
that
wasn't
at
issue
in
the
case.
the
court
doesn't
talk
about
any
of
the
surrounding
factual
circumstances.
there
might
have
been
1,000
things
we
don't
know
about
that
led
everybody
to
assume
--
that
was
--
that
led
everybody
to
assume
that
mr.
mathis
was
in
custody.
not
the
particular
things
that
the
sixth
circuit
mentioned.
justice
elena
kagan
but
we
don't
know
why
they
thought
mathis
was
in
custody.
it
just
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
case.
everybody
had
assumed
it.
