mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
two
issues.
the
first
is
whether
the
right
against
self-incrimination
requires
that
a
prisoner
always
be
mirandized
before
being
interviewed
in
isolation
about
conduct
that
occurred
outside
the
prisoner.
the
second
is
an
aedpa
question,
whether
this
court
in
mathis
clearly
established
such
a
per
se
rule.
for
three
reasons,
the
answers
to
both
questions
is
no.
first,
for
nearly
50
years
this
court
has
declined
to
adopt
any
new
per
se
rule
that
always
requires
a
miranda
warning,
instead
considering
all
the
circumstances.
lower
court--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--sure,
it's
a
circumstance
that
goes
into
the
all-the-circumstances
missed.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
correct,
we
agree
that
that--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--justice
sotomayor,
there
are
two
separate
tests.
and
i
go
back
just
to
last
term
in
the
j.d.b.
case.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it
would
be
much
more
difficult,
but
the
test
would
be
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
the
prisoner's
position
felt
that
they
were
free
to
go
back
to
their
cell
in
accord
with
reasonable
ordinary
prison
procedures.
and
that
would
be
the
test
that's
consistent
with
j.d.b.
and
i
submit
with
every
miranda
case
that
this
court
has
issued
in
the
last--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
there
are
a
number
of
circumstances
that
kind
of
culminate
in
what
i
consider
to
be
the
two
most
important.
remember
the
background
circumstances:
he
was
in
a
room
that
was
not
locked.
it
was
a
conference
room,
not
an
interrogation
room
with
a
bright
light.
he
was
not
shackled.
he
was
not
threatened.
he
was
not
physically
harmed
in
any
way.
the
two
big
ones
are:
one,
that
when
he
started
to
become
belligerent,
the
guards
told
him
that:
if
you
don't
want
to
cooperate,
then
you
will
have
to
go
back
to
your
cell;
you
will
have
to
leave.
and
that
is
the
exact
opposite
of
miranda
custody,
where--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--there
are
two
factors
that
go
into
the
mix,
and
i
will
discuss
each
one
in
turn.
when
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
talk
any
more,
then
he
went
on
and
kept
talking.
you
have
to
consider,
well,
why
does
he
keep
talking?
well,
the
record
shows,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
it
anyway,
that
he
was
trying
to
explain
to
the
officers
this
timeline
he
keeps
talking
about.
at
the
end,
when
it
was
a
20-minute
delay,
there
is
no
contention
that
that
was
anyhow
inconsistent
with
reasonable
prison
procedures.
and
the
fact
that
it
could
have
been
20
minutes,
it
could
have
been
30
seconds,
it
could
have
been
an
hour,
depending
on
procedures,
demonstrates
why
a
per
se
rule
doesn't
make
sense.
we
should
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that
is
a
little
bit
different.
but
the
key
facts
here
are,
one,
at
the
beginning,
the
questioning
officers
say:
you're
free
to
stop
this
and
go
back
to
your
cell.
then
in
the
middle,
he
gets
belligerent,
and
they
say:
if
you
don't
want
to
cooperate,
you
have
to
leave,
you
have
to
go
back
to
your
cell,
which
is,
i
submit,
the
opposite
of
miranda
custody.
and
then
when
he
finally
invokes
his
right
to
go
back
to
his
cell,
it
is
immediately
honored,
with
of
course
the
20-minute
delay
due
to
prison
procedures.
and
so
from
beginning
to
end,
a
reasonable
person
in
his
position
could
have
believed
they
were
free
to
return.
and
that
is
all
that
miranda
requires.
in
fact,
we
have
a
trial
court
finding
on
that,
on
three
of
them:
one,
that
he
was
told
he
was
free
to
go;
second,
that
he
understood
he
was
free
to
go;
and
third,
that
he
was
free
to
go,
and
that's
all--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--again,
i
would
submit
those
are
all
circumstances
that
should
go
into
this
"all
the
circumstances"
consideration.
you
know,
there
were
also
other
things
that
militated
in
favor
of
the
trial
court
findings,
such
as
the
explicit
instruction
that
he
was
free
to
leave;
that
he
would
have
to
go
back
if
he
didn't
cooperate;
that
they
did
honor
his
request
to
leave,
once
made.
so
these
are
all
the
things
that
the
court
should
look
at.
and
you
can
imagine
the
number
of
other
situations,
maybe
with
facts
different
than
these,
where
a
per
se
rule
would
be
wholly
inappropriate.
you
know,
what
if
they
had
invited
him
to
come
down
and
he
had
the
choice
at
the
beginning?
what
if
someone
was
stationed
outside
the
door
and
took
him
immediately
as
soon
as
he
said:
i'm
ready
to
go
back.
it
just
demonstrates
that
this
isn't
the
place
for
a
per
se
rule;
that
we
should
just
follow
the
same
miranda
test
that
has
been
applied
for
50
years,
and
that's
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
we
are
not
taking
quite
that
strong
a
position.
we
are
arguing
all
the
circumstances.
and
the
analogy
that
i
would
draw
is
just
like
in
the
j.d.b.
case
last
term,
that
you
would
consider
not
only
the
age
of
the
suspect,
but
also
the
school
environment.
so
i'm
not
saying
the
prison
environment
is
taken
out
of
the
equation,
just
that
it's
not
dispositive
in
and
of
itself,
just
like
this
court
held
in
shatzer.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
not
only
can,
but
should,
absolutely.
and,
you
know,
one
of
the
benefits
of
having
a
per
se
--
i'm
sorry
--
of
having
an
all-the-circumstances
rule,
rather
than
a
per
se
rule,
is
that
it
encourages
truthful,
voluntary
confession.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
such
confessions
are
an
unmitigated
social
good.
that's
something
that
we
want.
and
you
can
imagine
again
that
there
are
a
variety
of
non-prison
contexts
where
it
would
certainly
be
easier
to
have
a
per
se
rule.
you
could
have
done
that
in
j.d.b.--
you
know,
it's
so
coercive
to
take
an
8-year-old
child
to
the
principal's
office
with
an
officer
to
question
him,
that
per
se
is
always
going
to
be
some
child
version
of
the
miranda
rule.
but
we
don't
do
that.
or
if
you
had
someone
in
the
hospital
and
they
were
in
such
a
position
that
they
were
physically
unable
to
leave.
we
don't
have
a
hospital
miranda
rule.
there
shouldn't
be
one
in
prison,
either.
we
should
just
take
all
the
circumstances
into
account.
and
i
think
really
the
lesson
of
shatzer
is
that
we
start,
justice
kagan,
right
where
you
did,
that
just
simply
being
in
prison,
being
interrogated
--
i'm
sorry
--
being
in
jail
alone
is
not
enough.
but
it's
going
to
become
one
factor
that
we
consider
in
this
larger
test.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
in
this
particular
situation?
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
think
it
cuts
in
our
favor,
as
the
trial
court
found,
and
the
court
should
defer
to
that,
for
all
the
reasons
i
just
stated:
that
he
was
not
threatened;
not
physically
harmed,
he
was
in
a
conference
room;
door
wasn't
locked.
of
course,
the
big
two:
that
when
he
got
belligerent
they
told
him:
if
you
don't
want
to
cooperate,
you
have
to
leave,
the
opposite
of
miranda
custody
when
you
say,
if
you
don't
cooperate,
you
will
not
be
permitted
to
leave;
and
also
that
when
he
made
the
request
to
go,
it
was
honored
within
the
amount
of
time
that
they
would
have
expected
per
prison
policy.
so--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that's
the
case
because--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
don't
think
that's
the
case
because
under
shatzer
there's
nothing
miranda
custodial
about
simply
being
in
his
cell.
and
if
he
wants
to
stay
away
from
his
cell,
as
it
appears
to
here
because
he
was
trying
to
explain
himself,
that's
one
of
those
factors
that
militates
against
a
finding
of--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
think
it
makes
it
stronger,
because
in
the
typical
miranda
case
you
would
say
to
someone:
if
you
don't
cooperate,
we
are
going
to
keep
you
here
as
long
as
it
takes.
and
here
they
were
saying
just
the
opposite.
and
the
message
they
sent
was
sent
was
consistent
with
the
instructions
they
gave
him
at
the
beginning:
if
you
tell
us
you
want
to
leave,
we
will
honor
that
request,
and
consistent
with
what
actually
happened
at
the
end.
he
said,
i
want
to
go
back,
and
they
honored
that
request.
and
i
think
one
of
the
other
factors
that
you
put
in
the
mix
here
is
that
we
were
dealing
with
outside
officers,
not
inside
prison
officers.
these
outside
officers
did
not
have
the
ability
to
impact
his
day-to-day
prison
life
the
way
someone
inside
the
prison
would.
now,
one
other
point
i
want
to
make
about
in
and
out
of
prison
is
this
artificial
line
that
the
sixth
circuit
drew
to
cabin
its
per
se
rule.
they
said
that
if
the
conduct
takes
place
outside
the
prison
per
se
you
get
miranda;
if
the
conduct
that
they
are
questioning
talking
about
was
inside
the
prison
walls,
we
are
not
going
to
do
that.
and
the
sixth
circuit
was
forced
to
make
that
policy
decision
because
otherwise
prison
administration
becomes
very
difficult.
but
under
this
court's
precedent
and
under
the
fifth
amendment
itself,
there
is
nothing
that
would
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
distinction
in
the
miranda
analysis
as
to
the
locus
of
the
conduct
that
is
being
questioned
about.
and
it's
possible
to
have
a
very
serious
in-prison
crime,
a
murder
of
another
inmate,
and
a
very
nominal
outside
crime,
petty
theft,
and
yet
the
sixth
circuit
would
give
pure
miranda
protection
to
that
petty
theft
questioning
and
no
protection
at
all
to
the
person
who
murdered
someone
inside
the
prison
walls.
and
that
just
demonstrates
where
the
sixth
circuit
rule
starts
to
fall
apart.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
going
to
start
with
the
premise
we
are
not
advocating
that
the
prison
conditions
fall
out
of
the
equation
entirely.
they
are
simply
part
of
the
mix
that
you
consider,
just
like
you
would
consider
the
school
environment
or
the
hospital
environment
or
a
customs
environment.
with
respect
to
being
taken
out
to
another
building,
so
long
as
a
reasonable
person
in
his
position
would
have
felt
free
to
go
back,
that
is
ultimately
the
dispositive
inquiry.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
there
are--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
there
are
three
factors
here,
and
i'll
quibble
just
a
little
bit
with
the
assumption
that
he
was
somehow
forced
to
go.
it's
true
they
didn't
ask
him
if
he
wanted
to
go,
but
there
is
also
no
contention
that
he
resisted
going
and
they
made
him
go
anyway.
what
he
said
is:
"i
didn't
know
where
we
were
going.
"
"i
felt
like
i
was
in
a
safe
environment
so
i
didn't
object.
"
then
once
he
got
to
the
room,
here
are
the
three
that
i
think
are
the
most
critical
facts:
that
he
was
told
right
at
the
beginning:
just
tell
us;
we'll
take
you
back
to
your
cell
when
you
want
to
do
that.
second,
when
he
got
belligerent
they
said:
if
you
don't
want
to
cooperate,
you
will
go
back
to
your
cell.
and
third,
when
he
asked
to
go
back
to
his
cell
that
request
is
honored
within
the
context
of
the
typical
prison
administration.
and
it's
very
possible
that
in
his
everyday
prison
life
he
could
be
taken
over
next
door
for
a
medical
exam,
he
could
be
taken
over
next
door
for
a
visitor
if
that
was
county
policy.
but
there
is
nothing
inherent
about
the
walk
into
the
next
building
that
means
per
se
he
has
to
be
mirandized.
again,
it's
just
one
factor
that
should
go
into
the
mix,
just
like
this
court
has
always
done
in
miranda
cases.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
think
the
hypotheticals
today
demonstrate
how
quickly
the
logic
of
the
sixth
circuit's
new
per
se
rule
falls
apart
when
you
test
it
with
other
facts.
even
in
the
sixth
circuit's
view,
you
would
already
would
make
exceptions
to
that
new
per
se
rule
if
it
was
in-prison
conduct
or
if
it
was
prison
guards
as
opposed
to
outside
guards.
in
response
to
questions
today,
mr.
fields'
counsel
admits
that
there
must
be
an
exception
if
you
have
a
button
that
you
can
press
to
get
out,
like
in
mr.
ellison's
situation,
the
first
circuit
case
that
justice
souter
wrote.
she
admitted
that
if
you
are
in
a
circle
of
proximity,
or
not
in
a
circle
of
proximity,
that
that
would
make
a
difference.
no
per
se
rule.
and
that
if
the
situation
isn't
confrontational,
that
you
need
to
have
an
exception
for
that,
or
if
the
prisoner
initiates
questioning.
and
you
can
imagine
many
other
hypotheticals
that
would
similarly
create
exceptions
to
what
is
supposedly
a
per
se
rule.
and
--
and
ultimately
what
this
comes
down
to
is
justice
alito's
question:
if
he
is
under
no
pressure
at
all,
the
prisoner
welcomes
the
questioning,
and
i
would
submit
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
here
shows
exactly
that,
that
even
then
it
would
be
required.
and
that
is
a
particularly
strange
rule.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not
a
constitutionally
mandated
protection
but
a
prophylaxis,
something
that
is
supposed
to
protect
a
constitutional
right,
and
where
the
protection
isn't
necessary,
nor
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule.
counsel
concedes
that
there
isn't
anything
in
mathis
that
clearly
establishes
the
rule
that
the
sixth
circuit
applied.
maybe
it's
an
extension,
maybe
it's
implied
--
i
think
it's
difficult
to
find
either
one
of
those
--
but
at
a
bare
minimum,
this
requires
reversal
under
the
aedpa
standard.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
sixth
circuit's
per
se
test
does
have
societal
cause;
it
impedes
prison
administration
and
eliminates
potential
for
voluntary
truthful
confessions
that
we
all
want.
finally,
the
test
that
we
advocate
for
is
not
our
own
per
se
test,
that
simply
saying
you're
free
to
leave
is
not
the
be-all,
end-all.
because
it's
possible
that
officers
could
say
you
are
free
to
leave
while
doing
something
else
nonverbally
that
indicates
you
are
not
free
to
leave.
that's
why
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
makes
the
most
sense.
we
urge
you
to
go
past
the
aedpa
question
and
actually
rule
on
the
merits,
because
we
think
that
would
be
good
guidance
for
the
lower
courts
and
for
law
enforcement
officials,
and
the
test
that
we
would
propose
is
that
a
miranda
warning
is
not
required
when
a
reasonable
person
in
the
prisoner's
position
would
have
felt
free
to
go
back
to
his
cell
in
accordance
with
ordinary
reasonable
prison
procedures.
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
